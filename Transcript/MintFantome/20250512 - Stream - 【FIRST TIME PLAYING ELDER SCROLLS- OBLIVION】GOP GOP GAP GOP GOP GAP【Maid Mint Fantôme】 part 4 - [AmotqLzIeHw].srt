1
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,870
Da-da-da-da!

2
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,790
Hello, everybody.

3
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:50,570
Welcome and

4
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,360
howdy-do-dy.

5
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,660
Before we start... I have some fruit I wanna eat.

6
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,100
I hope that's okay.

7
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,740
Small squishy.

8
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,160
Not squishy.

9
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,980
Not squishy.

10
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,780
What kind of fruit?

11
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,220
Oh, no.

12
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,660
A variety.

13
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,320
Oh, well, actually, okay, I have a variety of fruit.

14
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,460
I made a fruit salad yesterday.

15
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:47,980
And then... I went to a bakery today and I got, for the first time, I got this fruit... What do you call this?

16
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,520
Fruit pastry.

17
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,380
Delight.

18
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,540
And I'm trying it for the first time ever.

19
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
And you guys are gonna hear my reaction.

20
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,880
But right now, I'm just eating some fruit.

21
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
Because I just... I don't know.

22
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,820
I just want some fruit.

23
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
How are you guys doing today?

24
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,420
How was your weekend?

25
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,500
Tell me everything.

26
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,040
What you been up to?

27
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,200
Blueberry.

28
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,830
Good.

29
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,130
Mother's Day was nice.

30
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:21,570
Good.

31
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:22,550
Good.

32
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,110
You clean.

33
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,570
Good.

34
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,230
Catching up on a vod of what?

35
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,190
What are you watching?

36
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,770
Chores and rest.

37
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,150
Good.

38
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,530
Sea of thieves.

39
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:35,970
Good.

40
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,150
Oblivion.

41
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,270
Doing homework.

42
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,150
Doing laundry.

43
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,560
Leftover pizza.

44
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,120
Did you have a good maid day?

45
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,840
I did.

46
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,760
Happy Mother's Day.

47
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Why are you guys saying Happy Mother's Day to me?

48
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,380
Is it because I'm a cat mom?

49
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,700
My cats are really annoying today.

50
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,280
15 minute break.

51
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,180
For my fourth day working in the Pokemon Mines at PAX East.

52
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,600
It's crazy out here.

53
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,340
Maddie sent me a picture.

54
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,100
My friend Maddie.

55
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,380
Oh, that's Raspberry.

56
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:38,740
She sent me a picture of Minto, Minto plush, Chibi Minto plush taped to the information booth at PAX East.

57
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,880
She sent me, she sent me this photo.

58
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,020
Finally, it's my turn to request a birthday song.

59
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,560
Wanchop, I'm so sorry.

60
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm not doing birthday songs right now.

61
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,620
But I can say happy, happy birthday, Wanchop.

62
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,100
Happy birthday.

63
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,300
Happy birthday.

64
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,640
Oh, yeah, hold on.

65
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,460
Let me get it.

66
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm eating banana.

67
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,020
Where is it?

68
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,840
She said, I get to meet all your crazy fans.

69
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,440
And then I said, they're also your crazy fans.

70
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,620
I think if they're meeting you too, they're also one of your fans.

71
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,640
This is the photo she sent me.

72
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,580
She said, yeah, she sent me.

73
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Oh, she also, she also got this.

74
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,860
She also sent me this picture.

75
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,640
Sorry, Maddie.

76
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,020
I didn't ask her for permission to post these, but hold on.

77
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
She also sent me this one.

78
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:52,960
Oh.

79
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,200
Hello.

80
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,070
This.

81
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,230
And she said, you're so tall.

82
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,300
I know.

83
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,820
I'm like towering over.

84
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,940
I'm towering over, Snake.

85
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,060
Future Beyond.

86
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,500
It was my birthday last Thursday, but I haven't been able to catch a stream due to travels.

87
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,300
Thanks for your encouragement.

88
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,000
I finally started getting out of my shell to try new things I might enjoy.

89
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,460
P.S.

90
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,620
I met a Nobel Prize laureate over the weekend.

91
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,060
Whoa.

92
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,060
Happy birthday, Future Beyond.

93
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,100
Thank you so much for the Haka Super.

94
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,880
Thank you.

95
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,420
Thank you.

96
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,100
Thank you.

97
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,500
Ow.

98
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,020
Sorry.

99
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,080
I hit my mic.

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,520
Hang on.

101
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,280
I told Maddie, have fun and enjoy your bubble tea.

102
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,140
It looks really yummy.

103
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,120
I wish I could have had a sip.

104
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,620
But this is kind of terrifying.

105
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,780
This photo is kind of...

106
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,440
It's kind of crazy.

107
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
She looks so snug.

108
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,860
And also like...

109
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,760
So...

110
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,300
So...

111
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,360
So...

112
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,460
I don't know how to say it.

113
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:09,860
I don't know.

114
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,360
So...

115
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Like she's being contained.

116
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,500
Pineapple.

117
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,620
It's where she belongs.

118
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,640
It has aura.

119
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

120
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,860
For sure, for sure.

121
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,460
For sure, for sure.

122
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,120
Thank you for streaming on my birthday, Minto.

123
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,480
Oh, Eggie, Eggie, Eggie, Eggie.

124
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,980
Eggie Vaughn, happy birthday.

125
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,520
Are you...

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,080
Am I what?

127
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,980
Am I what?

128
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,140
My mod never ever says anything.

129
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,580
And sometimes cryptic stuff.

130
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,870
It's a face that says I'd do it again.

131
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:00,930
Yeah.

132
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,650
Got my plush towering over Lego Tokyo.

133
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,390
Nice.

134
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,930
Just like Godzilla would do.

135
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,830
I...

136
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,750
So, we're back in the oblivion.

137
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,250
We're back in the oblivion.

138
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,790
And...

139
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,170
What happened last time?

140
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:26,610
Oh!

141
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,290
Last time we started, I thought I was gonna assassinate people.

142
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,050
And I did my best.

143
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,990
But I was not powerful enough.

144
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,490
Every time I would assassinate a guy, he would be like, Help!

145
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,550
Help!

146
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,970
And then the guard would come immediately.

147
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,730
And I'd be like, Uh-oh.

148
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,030
So...

149
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,210
That's not good.

150
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,190
I have to get more powerful so I can assassinate him in one fell swoop.

151
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,890
And then, I was like, Okay, well, for now, we'll continue the main quest.

152
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,110
Since I, uh...

153
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,690
need to get stronger.

154
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,650
So I went back to Kvatch, also to get my horse.

155
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,810
And I, uh...

156
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,990
You'll never best Tutius Sextius.

157
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,530
We haven't even tried him.

158
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,090
We haven't even tried.

159
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,910
I tried David.

160
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,330
Davidie.

161
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,210
And so...

162
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,190
And so...

163
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,170
We...

164
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,090
We...

165
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,470
We...

166
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,590
Went back to Kvatch, and it was overrun by...

167
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,750
The Daedra.

168
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,410
The portal to Oblivion opened.

169
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,830
And I...

170
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,230
At first, didn't go through it.

171
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,510
And then I went through it.

172
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,370
And I went through it.

173
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,130
And our pal died by floating in the air.

174
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,830
We don't know how that happened to him.

175
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,590
He was flying!

176
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,890
And then he fell...

177
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,930
And died.

178
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,070
And died.

179
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,050
To Cusis...

180
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,030
Noi, noi.

181
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,650
Welcome to membership.

182
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,250
Thank you!

183
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,030
And then...

184
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,790
We saved...

185
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,990
The future...

186
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,350
The...

187
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,330
The son...

188
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,950
Of the old...

189
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,910
Emperor.

190
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,530
The old king died...

191
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,550
And we saved his son, who was the priest at Kvac.

192
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:38,050
And then we were gonna take him to... To Winry Priory.

193
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:49,970
And we went there, and then... Aeronarn... was like... Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.

194
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:59,610
He... He... They suddenly started attacking that place.

195
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,730
May or may not still be in that.

196
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,490
We don't know.

197
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,930
Legendary moment.

198
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,250
And there was definitely someone behind him.

199
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,110
And he was like, I think they're behind me.

200
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,250
He was definitely... He was right behind him.

201
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,330
I've never heard that sound bug.

202
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,090
It's my favorite thing ever.

203
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,730
As Todd Howard said before, it just... It just works.

204
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,250
Yes.

205
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,210
Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.

206
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,960
And... So now... We have to transport...

207
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,140
We have to transport...

208
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,960
The son of the emperor to a place where he won't be...

209
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,420
He will be safe.

210
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,580
But before that, I'm gonna try this pastry.

211
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,680
It has fruit in it.

212
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
I wonder what the cream is like inside, though.

213
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,660
I wonder what the cream is like inside, though.

214
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Oh!

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,420
Oh!

216
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,660
It's all over my fingers.

217
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,700
Oh!

218
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,040
It's messy.

219
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,560
Oh!

220
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,500
I can't get it out.

221
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,320
Oh!

222
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,260
Hold on.

223
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,820
Oh, my goodness.

224
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,780
There's cream all over my fingers.

225
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,880
Oh!

226
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,640
Oh, wow!

227
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,820
This is really much thicker than I thought.

228
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:35,890
Oh!

229
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,430
Oh!

230
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,870
Oh!

231
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:44,750
Oh!

232
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,060
Oh!

233
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,100
Wow!

234
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,080
This is so good.

235
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,500
Hold on.

236
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,120
Let me try though.

237
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,720
With the orange.

238
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,600
Oh!

239
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,060
Wow!

240
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,260
It's so yummy!

241
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,060
I'm gonna go put this back in the fridge and go wash my hands...

242
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,400
I'll be right back.

243
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,850
I'm just licking up the cream.

244
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,850
I can't even eat the pastry part.

245
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,210
I think I need a proper plate.

246
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,610
Okay.

247
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,850
Let me go get it.

248
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,990
I'll be right back.

249
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,970
I'm back.

250
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,830
That was not... Oh, I put my headphones on backwards.

251
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,650
I don't want to be Barry.

252
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,810
That was not a stream time treat.

253
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,750
I apologize.

254
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,130
I apologize.

255
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,230
Okay.

256
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,730
All right.

257
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,510
Let me take a sip of my tea.

258
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,990
And let's get into the game, baby.

259
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:16,850
Yeah.

260
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,150
Finally, 20 minutes in.

261
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,490
Yeah.

262
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,570
A little too messy.

263
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,990
Also, stop being freaks in the chat.

264
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,230
Stop being freaks.

265
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:31,990
I tell you.

266
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,970
I tell you now.

267
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,050
Stop being freaks.

268
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,910
Thanks for the recap.

269
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,390
Couldn't catch last stream or VOD.

270
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,630
So awesome to know.

271
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,170
Oh, yeah.

272
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,690
Of course.

273
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,170
All right.

274
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,810
I believe it's this.

275
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,490
Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:48,970
It's this one.

277
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,550
We're only level five.

278
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,050
Been a while.

279
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,710
Hope you've been good.

280
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,350
I'm good.

281
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,290
Thank you.

282
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,750
Hey, what's your bedtime reading material tonight, Minto?

283
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,450
I haven't listened to anything recently.

284
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:06,750
Finally.

285
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,370
Um...

286
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,060
Nope.

287
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,300
How's your glass house, Minto?

288
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
We load the game.

289
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,180
Wait.

290
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,560
Oh, it's... What did I call it earlier?

291
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,820
It's... Weynon Priory.

292
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,380
I think I called it... Winery or something.

293
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,080
Welcome back to Weynon Priory.

294
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,380
Oh!

295
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,880
That's one of the guys we just killed.

296
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,320
Dang!

297
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,740
He's got riches!

298
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
Oh, my goodness!

299
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,560
Oh, my goodness!

300
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,740
And then also say hello.

301
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,240
Oh.

302
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,260
E-Tina.

303
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,420
Don't look at him.

304
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,260
Yep.

305
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,420
That's E-Tina.

306
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,580
Wait.

307
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,280
What do you got?

308
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
They've all...

309
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,660
They used to not carry gold.

310
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,600
But now they've all got gold.

311
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,860
Let's go.

312
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,740
What time is it?

313
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, it's almost 3am.

314
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,460
This game is so bright.

315
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,560
It's like hard to tell that it's like...

316
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,600
Oh, it's 3am.

317
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,500
Boy, 3am.

318
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,160
Hmm.

319
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,600
This place looks so run down for it actually being like, you know...

320
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,960
Used?

321
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,760
Looting bodies at 3am?

322
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,140
Oh, yeah, I am.

323
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,280
Nothing.

324
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,780
Nothing.

325
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,200
Nothing.

326
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,320
Nothing.

327
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,560
Absolutely nothing.

328
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
Our money now.

329
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,040
Could be worse a game where you can't see squat.

330
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,820
So true.

331
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,480
But it makes me think that the sun is coming up.

332
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,480
Like any second now.

333
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm like, oh.

334
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,140
Look how beautiful it is.

335
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,560
Yes, let me know.

336
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,340
What was that?

337
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,480
Let me know if I need to do anything with sound.

338
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,380
And or...

339
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Graphics.

340
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,020
This guy was hungry.

341
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,240
Okay.

342
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,800
I think that was all of them.

343
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,740
I think that was all of them.

344
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,320
Sound good so far?

345
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:26,960
Okay, cool.

346
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,460
So...

347
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,600
We know where we must go.

348
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,680
We must go to...

349
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,040
From here...

350
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
To here.

351
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,360
Can we fast...

352
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Trev...

353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Yeah, we can!

354
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,840
But it's like...

355
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,220
So lame to do that.

356
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I've never been here before.

357
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,440
So I don't wanna do that.

358
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,560
Do the scenic route.

359
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,140
Oops, sorry.

360
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,580
I'm hitting my mic.

361
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,120
Hold on, I'm adjusting stuff real quick.

362
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,820
Yeah, I kinda wanna take the scenic route.

363
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,700
I kinda wanna walk there.

364
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Is that okay?

365
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,900
My immersion is shattered if you fast travel.

366
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,260
So true!

367
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,180
A single gold.

368
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
Okay.

369
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,480
Let's do it.

370
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,720
And they're up here.

371
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,420
Oh!

372
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,500
You guys are much closer than before.

373
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,720
Hello, Joffrey.

374
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,640
As a blade, my place is at Martin's side.

375
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,000
He's got the blade.

376
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,660
Joffrey's got his katana.

377
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,020
And we're going to Cloud Ruler Temple.

378
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,780
Which totally sounds like a place...

379
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,860
That is...

380
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,500
Like a Zelda temple, no?

381
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,900
We are Boo Joffrey.

382
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,100
With the amulet taken by the enemy, we must get Martin to safety at Cloud Ruler Temple.

383
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,920
It does, right?

384
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,700
Cloud Ruler Temple was built long ago by the founders of the Blades.

385
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,700
Back in the days of Raymond Cyrodiil.

386
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,320
It is high in the mountains near Bruma.

387
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,080
High in the mountains.

388
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,320
Our ancient fortress, sanctuary, refuge of last resort.

389
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,140
Martin will be as safe there as anywhere.

390
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,940
Cool.

391
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,580
One of the youngest blades ever to serve in the Emperor's personal guard.

392
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,760
I am glad to hear that he survived, but I fear he will take the Emperor's death particularly hard.

393
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,580
Fast traveling to somewhere you've never been before feels wrong.

394
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,360
I agree.

395
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
I agree.

396
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,840
Especially because I want to see everything in this game.

397
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,420
Who are the Blades?

398
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,600
Boris.

399
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,100
I am the Grand Master of the Blades.

400
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,020
We serve the Emperor and the Septim Bloodline.

401
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,740
Talos is our patron.

402
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,120
You wonder to find me here?

403
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,520
Discretion is our watchword.

404
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,820
Only a few of us have the honor to serve publicly in the Imperial Guard.

405
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,420
Emperor Bodyguard Army.

406
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,420
Dragonfire.

407
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,000
The coronation of each new emperor is sealed when he uses the Amulet of Kings to light the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One.

408
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,480
The Dragonfires of Akatosh remain lit until the death of the Emperor.

409
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,480
His successor then lights them anew upon ascending to the throne.

410
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:24,160
With Emperor Uriel dead and no successor crowned, the Temple of the One will be dark for the first time in centuries.

411
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
Oh my god.

412
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Elder Council.

413
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,760
The Elder Council rules in the Emperor's absence by ancient tradition.

414
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,300
Old.

415
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,140
Chancellor Akato heads the Elder Council and is the closest thing the Empire has to a leader right now.

416
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,120
But the Blades answer only to the Emperor, of course.

417
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,340
We are not an arm of the government.

418
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,820
What if...

419
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,420
They don't want a new Emperor?

420
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,200
Or...

421
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,540
What if that Chancellor guy is like...

422
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,780
I'm sending the dark people to...

423
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,560
To kill...

424
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,320
So that I'll become...

425
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,280
The Emperor.

426
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,820
The Daedra Prince of Destruction.

427
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,460
Oh, that's right!

428
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,760
An inveterate foe of all mortal races.

429
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,100
He was involved with Jaegar Tharn's plot against the Empire years ago.

430
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,640
Maybe.

431
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,660
It doesn't surprise me to find his hand in the current calamity.

432
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
Mm-hmm.

433
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,200
We should get moving.

434
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,700
I won't rest easy until Martin is safe at Cloud Ruler Temple.

435
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,760
You okay, Martin?

436
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,400
Let's continue on to Cloud Ruler Temple.

437
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,920
I haven't had a good night's sleep since Kavach was attacked.

438
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,360
How long were you waiting there?

439
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,040
The sooner we reach Cloud Ruler Temple, the better.

440
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,460
Alright.

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,000
Lead on!

442
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,080
Lead on!

443
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,400
Are you coming with me, Joffrey?

444
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:36,820
Let's go.

445
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,500
Everybody?

446
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:38,900
Autobots?

447
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,160
Wait.

448
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,160
Are you coming too, or...?

449
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,340
I think Brother Piner is staying here.

450
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,180
Everyone else?

451
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,620
Roll out!

452
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,290
I love walking for the silly diversions.

453
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,570
They will happen.

454
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,370
Most likely.

455
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,570
Alright, team.

456
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,890
Where are you going?

457
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,470
What?

458
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,230
Oh, they have their own plans, I guess.

459
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,470
My horse is over here!

460
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,430
They're kicking up so much dirt.

461
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,210
Oh wait, is he...

462
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,010
He's getting his own horse.

463
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,710
Oh my god, they get their own horses!

464
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,390
What if I didn't have a horse?

465
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,920
I can talk to the horse.

466
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,240
Let's continue on to Cloud Ruler Temple.

467
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,780
I haven't had a good night's sleep since Kvach was attacked.

468
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,200
Dang, I thought they were just gonna be...

469
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,900
Follow me, yeah.

470
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,580
I thought they were just gonna be...

471
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,660
...running after me.

472
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,320
While I rode the horse.

473
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
Good thing I didn't steal those horses.

474
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,820
No!

475
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,460
What if I did take those horses?

476
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:57,840
Alrighty.

477
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,060
Team!

478
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,760
We're going here because...

479
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,060
The reason why I was like, let's go to this place first before we...

480
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,060
...try to assassinate...

481
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,260
...the guys at Skingrad.

482
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,620
I haven't even been to Anvil.

483
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,060
Oh my gosh, there's so much.

484
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,020
Um...

485
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,980
...was because...

486
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,060
We were kind of like, in the middle of this...

487
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:19,780
This...

488
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,060
I didn't want to just leave him here.

489
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,400
I wanted to...

490
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,860
I wanted to deliver him to the temple and then we could continue with any other...

491
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,640
...quest that we felt like we wanted to do.

492
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,060
Like meeting Gray Fox and...

493
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:32,980
Yeah!

494
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,880
Yeah!

495
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,380
Oh, wait.

496
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,020
Okay.

497
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,540
What's Pilgrimage?

498
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,540
I don't care.

499
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,380
Oh, this is the one in Anvil.

500
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,440
The one that was at the attack chapel.

501
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,700
We have so many...

502
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,380
So many quests.

503
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,480
Okay.

504
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,060
Um...

505
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,460
I'm guessing it's this one.

506
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,760
Onwards!

507
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,430
He's that ninja.

508
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,190
Yeah.

509
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,910
Um...

510
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,350
Oh...

511
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,450
Yeah.

512
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,450
Wait!

513
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,890
Is that it up there?

514
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,210
Wait, you guys see that?

515
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,790
You got...

516
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,490
It's like hidden amongst the trees.

517
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:24,370
Wait.

518
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:24,390
Wait.

519
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,070
See that tower?

520
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,210
What is that?

521
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,110
Oh wait.

522
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:28,690
Sorry.

523
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,190
My chat...chat was...the one right next to chat.

524
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,130
What is that?

525
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,510
It looks kind of beat up though.

526
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,850
Hold on.

527
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,870
Go to...the right.

528
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,010
DLC home.

529
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,950
I...couldn't find any DLC to buy.

530
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,310
On...steam, you guys.

531
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,010
I looked because I was curious.

532
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,230
People were like, DLC.

533
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,370
I couldn't find anything.

534
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,030
It's part of the game.

535
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:01,610
Oh.

536
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,750
That's not...that's not DLC.

537
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,870
I don't think.

538
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,670
I don't think that counts.

539
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,710
Oh, it was DLC in 2006.

540
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,590
Oh, originally.

541
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,270
Wait.

542
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,930
Whose house?

543
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,610
Oh, no.

544
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,110
Paint horse.

545
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,330
Uh...oh.

546
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:20,930
Uh-oh.

547
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,270
Um...

548
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,670
Team?

549
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,790
Team?

550
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,390
Oh, gosh.

551
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,150
You scared me.

552
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:30,910
Team?

553
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,490
All you have to do is follow the road.

554
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,370
What is...what is happening?

555
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,030
Oh, there he is.

556
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,560
Oh, uh-oh.

557
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,260
Oh, oh.

558
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,100
You're a good guy.

559
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,460
You're...you're just...you're a good guy.

560
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,460
Yes.

561
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:56,840
Oh, my gosh.

562
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,560
Scared me.

563
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,620
I thought he was a bandit.

564
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,800
I say good guy.

565
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,420
I don't know.

566
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,020
Well...Ignore the dog.

567
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,100
Oh, shoot.

568
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,280
Dang it.

569
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,420
The dog will not ignore us.

570
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,140
Ooh!

571
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,580
Ah!

572
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,300
Oh, gosh.

573
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,640
Scared the hell out of me.

574
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,960
Oh, my God.

575
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,200
No.

576
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,280
Help!

577
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,580
Your horse is escaping you!

578
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,600
Why does the dog have money on it?

579
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,420
Get back on your horse.

580
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,080
Why did you get off your horse?

581
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,040
Oh, my God.

582
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,820
I hate...

583
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,240
I hate escort missions.

584
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,800
Hello, sir?

585
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,760
Any room?

586
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh.

587
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,980
You...I've seen your kind before.

588
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,280
What?

589
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
You've got blood on your hands.

590
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,380
Keep your blade sheathed, you murdering bastard.

591
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,340
Or I'll put you down myself.

592
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,380
I served my time!

593
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh, damn!

594
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,820
Emperors have been assassinated before, but...

595
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,080
This time...

596
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,200
I don't know.

597
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,480
It's different.

598
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,420
Can't you feel it?

599
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,280
A shadow is falling across all of Tamriel.

600
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,540
He won't even look at me.

601
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,040
Farewell, citizen.

602
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,140
He hates me.

603
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,880
It's fine.

604
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,420
I hate him, too.

605
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,640
Oh, he killed that dog for me.

606
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,580
You...I've seen your kind before.

607
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,220
He called me a murdering bastard!

608
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,800
Is he wrong?

609
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,580
And I'd do it again.

610
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,480
He's taking the shortcut.

611
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,300
Every time.

612
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
Don't run into me.

613
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,980
Don't do it.

614
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,140
Etina does not pass the vibe check.

615
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,240
What do you mean?

616
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,560
Of course he does!

617
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,320
I'm not a thief.

618
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,280
I borrowed it.

619
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,280
He just misunderstood my intentions.

620
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,220
And then tried to kill me.

621
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,180
And I killed him out of self-defense.

622
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,780
Oh, hold on.

623
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,460
Wait a second.

624
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,140
This other road...

625
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,300
Where am...

626
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,440
Where am...

627
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,460
Oh, right here.

628
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,060
It's not even on the map.

629
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,500
Where could it go?

630
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,660
Okay, detour!

631
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,660
A little detour!

632
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm just curious.

633
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,860
Oh, shoot.

634
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,900
That's a dog, isn't it?

635
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,300
I'm ignoring him.

636
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,800
He'll leave us alone eventually.

637
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,860
Whoa!

638
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,060
Whoa!

639
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,560
Miranda!

640
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,920
Who is she?

641
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,980
Oh my god, it's an imp!

642
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,380
Oh my god.

643
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,220
Oh my god.

644
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,200
Oh, horse, run!

645
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,880
Horse, run!

646
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,440
Oh, shoot.

647
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm adding

648
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,250
my horse on fire!

649
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,260
Are you okay, horse?

650
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
He's so traumatized.

651
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,100
Gosh, dang!

652
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,880
What a trooper.

653
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,480
My poor horse.

654
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,460
Where'd the other guy go?

655
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,080
Well, there he is.

656
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,280
Nasty.

657
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,740
Um, hold on, team.

658
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,800
This looks to be...

659
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
Is this a... a dungeon?

660
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,260
Miranda.

661
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,820
I'm just gonna look inside real quick.

662
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,420
Why were they harassing...

663
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,580
Oh.

664
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,180
What's this little sneak peek?

665
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,340
They're not coming in.

666
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,140
I just wanted a peek.

667
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,220
I just wanted a peek.

668
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,880
I just wanted a little sneak peek.

669
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,780
I can't take those.

670
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,440
Just want a little sneak peek.

671
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,740
They really hit the horse for some reason.

672
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,440
Suspicious.

673
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,900
What was that horse up to before you got him?

674
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,920
Oh my god!

675
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,980
The horse...

676
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,400
That's why they couldn't come in!

677
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,700
The horse couldn't fit through the door!

678
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,240
It's alright, team.

679
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,040
We discovered a new spot.

680
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,480
We will be back.

681
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,510
Horses can report your crimes to the guards.

682
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,430
Including their own theft?

683
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,210
Huh?

684
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,530
I pray to Todd you can find a phone.

685
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,630
What do you mean?

686
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,950
Wait, how can the horse...

687
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,130
Do that?

688
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,840
We must not get distracted, team.

689
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,900
I...

690
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,400
As much as I want to...

691
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,560
Plunder and pillage...

692
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,900
And dungeon and crawl.

693
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,460
We must deliver this man to the temple.

694
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,220
Horse whisperer.

695
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,540
I don't hear them.

696
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,940
God dang it!

697
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,200
Why are they so slow?

698
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,380
Uh-oh.

699
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,220
Wait, what was that?

700
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,780
Oh, there he is.

701
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,580
There's one of them.

702
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,580
I think I see the other.

703
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,900
Just very slowly...

704
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,440
There you go.

705
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,140
Alright, team.

706
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,340
Onwards.

707
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,460
What?

708
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,200
I don't...

709
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,020
Why do they refuse to take the road?

710
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,050
At least if I'm fastest...

711
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,530
Oh, wait.

712
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,490
Gladimist Cave.

713
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,570
See, this is another road that's not even on the map.

714
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,430
The Red Ring Road.

715
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,910
Cave.

716
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,590
Is this a cave?

717
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,630
This looks like a cave.

718
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:54,890
Oh, yeah.

719
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,770
This is the cave.

720
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,350
Oh, I think we found the cave.

721
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,970
What the heck is this place?

722
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,720
Don't go in there.

723
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,060
Uh-oh.

724
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,600
I'm trapped.

725
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,660
Turn around.

726
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,900
Turn around.

727
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:08,900
Beep, beep.

728
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,200
Oh!

729
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,160
No, no, no, no.

730
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:10,900
God, no.

731
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,720
No, no, no, no.

732
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,860
Please, horse.

733
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,500
Oh, it's the Imperial City.

734
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,320
Oh, okay.

735
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,940
Come on, team.

736
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,060
We're all accounted for.

737
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,020
Why?

738
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,900
Why is it so easy to lose you?

739
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:35,840
Okay.

740
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,220
They just don't keep up at all.

741
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,920
All right.

742
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,740
Onwards.

743
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
Onwards.

744
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,620
Okay.

745
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,240
All right.

746
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,240
We're all good.

747
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,120
I'm too quick.

748
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,700
I've...

749
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,260
I put all my stuff into speed.

750
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,020
Hmm.

751
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,320
I don't hear footsteps behind me.

752
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,230
Should I really try and buy a house?

753
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,470
Cause like...

754
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,270
Oh, there's another cave we're about to come up on.

755
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,930
What is...

756
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,430
What's a house good for?

757
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,260
In this economy?

758
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,020
What is...

759
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,940
Oh, that's Miranda.

760
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:36,920
That's the cave.

761
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:37,380
Okay.

762
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,400
Okay.

763
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:43,990
Wow.

764
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,230
It's so peaceful.

765
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,930
It's almost like...

766
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,070
We never got attacked.

767
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:50,970
I'm backing up.

768
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,610
Oh, there they are.

769
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,090
Okay, you're fine.

770
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,970
You can roleplay.

771
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,070
That's exciting.

772
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,610
Oh, golly.

773
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,870
This looks dangerous.

774
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,590
Is this...

775
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,350
Is this sturdy?

776
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,350
You are the boss.

777
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:08,990
Oh my gosh.

778
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:09,950
I thought you were...

779
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,990
I thought you were...

780
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,050
A bandit for a second.

781
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:12,990
Hey, hold on.

782
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,630
Let me talk to you.

783
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,170
Oh.

784
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,310
You have my ear, citizen.

785
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,330
I am a citizen.

786
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,350
Oh, hold on.

787
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:18,790
Let me talk to you.

788
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,210
Good morning.

789
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,470
That horse's ass.

790
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,590
Don't look at it like that.

791
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,810
Any rumors around here, soldier?

792
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,390
If you've got to travel by the Nine Divines...

793
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,450
Oh, okay.

794
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,090
Carry on.

796
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,270
I will.

797
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,630
And so will my team.

798
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,330
Oh, gosh.

799
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,470
We lost the old man.

800
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,550
Oh, no.

801
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,230
He's over there.

802
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:42,890
Okay, we're fine.

803
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,610
Ooh, it's getting chilly.

804
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,930
It's getting a little cold.

805
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,410
Around here.

806
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,750
What?

807
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,510
Oh, wait.

808
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,570
Another...

809
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,030
Another fountain thing.

810
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,530
Oh, this is where the road goes.

811
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,750
I see a dog.

812
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,150
I'm gonna get his ass first.

813
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,610
I'm gonna get him first.

814
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,790
Don't worry.

815
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,510
Yeah.

816
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,430
Get his...

817
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,110
Get that dog.

818
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:17,590
Alright.

819
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

820
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,270
No other dog?

821
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,630
I got that dog.

822
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,500
Are you gonna kill every dog we come across?

823
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,840
They attack me!

824
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,600
What do you...

825
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:49,980
What do you...

826
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,220
What do you want from me?

827
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,920
What do you want from me?

828
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,380
There come...

829
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,740
It's self-defense, literally!

830
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,420
Wait.

831
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,480
Is this the road?

832
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,020
Wait, what's...

833
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,800
What is this way?

834
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,060
What's down here?

835
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,440
I must explore.

836
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,000
We're filling out our map.

837
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,230
It's not murder.

838
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,090
It's self-defense.

839
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,750
I promise.

840
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,530
It's the truth.

841
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,110
It's the doggone truth.

842
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,910
And that dog is gone.

843
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,930
Just like that guard.

844
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,310
That was also...

845
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,510
Defense.

846
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,750
Oh, this thing doesn't work.

847
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,330
Back it up.

848
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,870
Back it up.

849
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,290
Back it up.

850
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:50,790
Back it up.

851
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,210
Pre-emptive self-defense.

852
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:55,670
Wait, where's...

853
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,250
Oh, hello.

854
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,310
What a silly guy.

855
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,550
It was self-offense.

856
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,070
Am I on the road?

857
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,990
I'm just like in the...

858
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,250
Oh my gosh, I'm a true pioneer.

859
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,490
I'm off the beaten path.

860
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,990
I'm off the map.

861
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,170
I'm off the beaten path.

862
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,510
They can never find me.

863
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,410
I'm where...

864
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:21,690
I'm...

865
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,270
I don't pay property taxes.

866
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,610
What's attacking me?

867
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,190
Okay, maybe that's just normal music.

868
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:32,950
Look at that view.

869
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,010
Oh, I know.

870
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,750
Where are we going anyway?

871
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,620
Atina running from taxes.

872
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,340
Absolutely.

873
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,560
Running from the law.

874
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,500
Running from taxes.

875
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,520
What's that over there?

876
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,980
Mysterious.

877
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Wait, where are we?

878
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,600
What?

879
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,570
How did I get back on the path?

880
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,040
Oh my God.

881
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,580
Here I thought...

882
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,140
Wait.

883
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,740
Wait.

884
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,560
Wait, but what's down...

885
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,180
So...

886
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,940
If I go down there, there's nothing.

887
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,340
Where are the guys at?

888
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,060
Hello?

889
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,860
Martin's so far behind.

890
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,080
Where do you think he'll come from?

891
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,900
Wait, is that his horse up there?

892
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,580
Wait.

893
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,240
No.

894
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,100
That's a...

895
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,100
What is that right there?

896
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,260
Is that a tree?

897
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,620
No, that's a horse.

898
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,320
Why is there a horse up there?

899
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,880
Who is that?

900
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,620
Is that him?

901
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,420
Why aren't you moving?

902
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,320
Wait.

903
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,000
Hello?

904
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,240
He's moonwalking down the room.

905
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
Stop doing that.

906
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,220
The hope of the world.

907
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,220
Oh my goodness gracious.

908
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,080
Wait, it's this way.

909
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,560
He was struggling so much and...

910
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,280
The other guy had no problems.

911
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,380
We're in the Jer...

912
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,120
Jer...

913
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,720
The Jerbal Mountains.

914
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,220
Wow.

915
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,900
Oh my gosh.

916
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,980
You know what?

917
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,680
Let's just keep going.

918
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,500
They'll...

919
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:02,840
They'll...

920
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,500
They'll catch up.

921
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,060
Oh!

922
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,400
Oh, please.

923
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,100
Oh shoot.

924
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:17,980
No!

925
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,820
Dang it!

926
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,340
No!

927
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,590
If only I hadn't missed that first shot.

928
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,790
Where'd my arrow go?

929
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:33,650
Where'd my arrow go?

930
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,250
Eaten.

931
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,850
It was a...

932
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,690
It was a sacrifice.

933
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,530
Oh!

934
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,470
You guys made it!

935
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,990
It was a...

936
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,530
Sacrifice for the rock.

937
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,560
Oh, it's foggy up here.

938
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,420
Oh!

939
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,020
Another...

940
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,540
Another dog.

941
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,860
Get off!

942
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,340
Get off!

943
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,330
Oh!

944
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,290
He sat down.

945
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,770
Maybe there was a good pup.

946
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,710
I don't think so.

947
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:13,310
It says wolf.

948
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,210
Okay.

949
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,290
Onwards!

950
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,910
Damaged one times.

951
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,610
Awesome.

952
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,450
There's a glowy stone up there.

953
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,890
Hold on.

954
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:32,890
I'm checking the map again.

955
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:33,650
Okay.

956
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,610
We'll go to the left.

957
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,240
Wolf can be...

958
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,300
Good pups.

959
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,920
Can they?

960
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:42,980
Me?

961
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,920
Or...

962
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,240
Are they all...

963
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,320
Murderers?

964
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,600
And...

965
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,780
I think that all of them want to eat my horse.

966
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,900
And for that I cannot forgive.

967
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,960
Imperial City.

968
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:56,660
Bruma.

969
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,800
Just stay on the pathway!

970
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,300
Why is it so difficult?

971
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,620
Whoa!

972
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,320
Okay.

973
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,380
I think we're here.

974
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,580
Wait.

975
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,660
Do we have to go through the city?

976
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,020
Yes.

977
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,040
Whose house is this?

978
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,400
Oh.

979
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,160
Stables.

980
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,580
Oh, look at that.

981
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,900
What a lovely horse you've got.

982
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,540
Would be a shame if it was needed for some...

983
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,100
Imperial business.

984
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,140
Hello, guard.

985
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,500
Oh.

986
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,400
He's so small.

987
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:48,860
What?

988
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,560
Frost Crag Spire has been uninhabited for so long.

989
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,340
They say it was as wondrous as the Arcane University itself.

990
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,080
What?

991
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,720
Okay, bye.

992
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,660
What the?

993
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,080
Whose horse is this?

994
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,380
Oh.

995
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,020
This is the final boss.

996
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,660
We must use the real royal guard.

997
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,920
This is who we have to get through.

998
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,320
To get into the city.

999
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,520
To get into the city.

1000
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,100
Oh.

1001
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,320
Uh...

1002
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,660
Wait, my horse can't...

1003
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,200
Wait.

1004
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,920
Hold on.

1005
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,680
Do I have to ride around the city?

1006
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,520
So I can use my horse?

1007
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,980
Just go around the city.

1008
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:33,840
Yes!

1009
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,220
Oh my goodness.

1010
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,720
Okay, back it up, everybody.

1011
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,600
Back it up, team.

1012
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,820
Back it up.

1013
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,820
Back it up, team.

1014
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,260
Back it up.

1015
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,760
This way.

1016
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,500
Oh, I wanted to...

1017
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,140
I was really excited about seeing the city.

1018
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,020
That horse was like...

1019
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,240
Only one horse is allowed in the premises.

1020
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,700
Aww.

1021
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,780
Going on the way back.

1022
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,860
Yeah, yeah, I will.

1023
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,480
Is that it up there?

1024
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,080
That doesn't look very...

1025
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,480
Like it...

1026
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,040
I don't...

1027
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,200
Is that inhabited?

1028
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,620
The controls are like a semi-truck when backing up.

1029
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,280
I mean, look at that.

1030
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,120
Horses.

1031
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,800
We're back in the gerbil mountains.

1032
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,620
Okay.

1033
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,680
Uh...

1034
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,400
Oh my...

1035
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,860
What the?

1036
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,490
Who are you?

1037
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,090
Oh!

1038
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,920
They just killed that guy.

1039
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,340
Was that guy a bandit?

1040
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,540
Well, they did me a...

1041
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,060
Solid.

1042
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,020
Oh.

1043
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,780
The Imperial Legion is at your disposal, citizen.

1044
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,960
What seems to be the problem?

1045
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,100
Uh...

1046
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,960
Nothing, actually.

1047
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,880
Emperors have been assassinated before, but...

1048
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,520
Okay.

1049
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,660
They all say the same thing.

1050
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,240
Farewell, citizen.

1051
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,160
They have the Imperial Guard hive mind.

1052
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,600
Where are the guys?

1053
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,580
Oh, there you are.

1054
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:12,800
Okay.

1055
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,500
That guy was just trying to hunt some deer and they shot him down.

1056
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,900
That's pretty crazy.

1057
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,060
Easy.

1058
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,650
So we need to go...

1059
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,980
This way?

1060
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,120
I suppose?

1061
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,780
Nature reserve.

1062
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,360
Ooh.

1063
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,160
I think it's this way.

1064
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,760
I think?

1065
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,300
Hold on.

1066
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,660
I'm double checking the map.

1067
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:46,940
Yes?

1068
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,600
Yes.

1069
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:54,730
No.

1070
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,570
Uh...

1071
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:00,310
Wait.

1072
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,110
Like, up...

1073
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:04,590
Here?

1074
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:09,170
Hold on.

1075
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,350
Let's try around here.

1076
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,710
To the east?

1077
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:15,750
East?

1078
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,160
Oh, I think we follow this path.

1079
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,560
Yeah!

1080
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,840
I found it.

1081
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,740
I thought you meant weest.

1082
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,960
How the months fly.

1083
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,380
Thank you, Nexy!

1084
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,140
Yeah.

1085
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,320
How they fly...

1086
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,240
Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.

1087
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,580
Thank you so much for the...

1088
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,680
Thank you!

1089
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,880
Cloud Ruler Temple!

1090
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,380
Alright.

1091
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,060
They'll get here soon.

1092
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,500
They'll be here shortly.

1093
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,300
I'm gonna look around a little bit.

1094
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,100
Don't fall.

1095
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,020
Oh, I...

1096
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,640
Oh, gosh.

1097
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,680
Etina, I know you can fly in the movie, but don't do it.

1098
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,800
See, that's what I was seeing before.

1099
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,140
Oh, I see an imp down there.

1100
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,720
You think I could snipe that guy?

1101
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,780
Oh, let's go in, guys.

1102
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,140
Get off your horse.

1103
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,420
Get off your horse.

1104
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,500
Yeah, we're here.

1105
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,220
Yep, we're here.

1106
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,200
Come on in.

1107
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,740
Oh, I need a key.

1108
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:48,980
Uh...

1109
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,540
You have a key?

1110
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,260
Oh.

1111
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,060
Yep, yep.

1112
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,980
May Talos guide you.

1113
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,400
God recommended your Choco Minto music video.

1114
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,800
Will we see you sing it anytime soon?

1115
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,480
Well...

1116
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,620
I'll put myself in your hands.

1117
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,800
It's a...

1118
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,780
Grandmaster, is this...

1119
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,160
Hold on.

1120
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,020
Yes, Cyrus.

1121
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,580
This is the emperor's son, Martin Septim.

1122
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,880
My lord.

1123
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,420
Welcome to Cloud Ruler Temple.

1124
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,560
We have not had the honor of an emperor's visit in many years.

1125
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,200
Wow.

1126
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,480
Ah, well, thank you.

1127
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,240
The honor is mine.

1128
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,400
Come.

1129
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,520
Your blades are waiting to greet you.

1130
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,860
Oh my god.

1131
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,420
No...

1132
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:36,900
No way.

1133
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,140
And everything!

1134
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,140
Oh my gosh.

1135
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,430
Konnichiwa.

1136
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:53,930
Inspired.

1137
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,630
The emperor and his sons were slain on our watch.

1138
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,770
The empire is in chaos.

1139
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,190
But there is yet hope.

1140
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:12,170
Here is Martin Septim, true son of Uriel Septim.

1141
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:13,450
Oh yeah, genius.

1142
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:17,930
Oh god, they scared me.

1143
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,110
Hail!

1144
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,630
You will be safe here until you can take up your throne.

1145
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:24,450
In Japan.

1146
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:25,210
Joffrey.

1147
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,670
Oh.

1148
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:26,630
All of you.

1149
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,490
I know you all expect me to be emperor.

1150
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,150
I'll do my best.

1151
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,290
Best.

1152
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,970
But this is all new to me.

1153
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,170
I'll do my best.

1154
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,390
I'm not used to giving speeches, but...

1155
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,370
I wanted you to know that I appreciate your welcome here.

1156
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,490
I hope I prove myself worthy of your loyalty in the coming days.

1157
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,470
That's it.

1158
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,130
Thank you.

1159
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:50,470
Best.

1160
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,490
You couldn't do a second take.

1161
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,470
We'd all best get back to our duties, eh, captain?

1162
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:58,270
Oh my god.

1163
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,230
Oh my god, you scared me.

1164
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,670
The blade saluting me and hailing me as Martin Septim.

1165
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:04,370
Yeah, that's you.

1166
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,650
I don't mean to sound ungrateful.

1167
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,970
I know I would be dead by now if it weren't for you.

1168
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,570
Thank you.

1169
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:11,870
Thank you.

1170
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:14,710
No one expects me to suddenly know what to do, how to behave.

1171
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,530
They want an emperor to tell them what to do.

1172
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,690
And I haven't the faintest idea.

1173
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:25,930
You need a little, you know, you need a little, a little ghost to whisper in your ear.

1174
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,810
We need to get the amulet back.

1175
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:28,670
Of course.

1176
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,590
The amulet of kings.

1177
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:37,350
So we, I, can take it to the temple of the one and light the dragon fires.

1178
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,370
And stop the oblivion invasion.

1179
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,450
Best way to end an inspirational speech.

1180
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,150
And you will be the emperor.

1181
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,250
The emperor.

1182
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,970
That's an idea that will take some getting used to.

1183
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,290
In any case, we need the amulet first.

1184
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,190
Maybe Joffrey will know where to start.

1185
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:56,330
Yeah.

1186
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:04,450
All practitioners of Daedric magic are familiar with the almost impenetrable barrier between our world and oblivion.

1187
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:09,930
What the emperor told you implies that the amulet is the key to the preservation of that barrier.

1188
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,890
What I saw at Kavarch.

1189
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:17,890
Everything I know about Daedric magic says that such stable portals are impossible.

1190
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,510
Yet those gates to oblivion existed.

1191
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,370
The old rules no longer apply.

1192
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:28,530
Kavarch is only the beginning of what Mehrunes Dagon will do.

1193
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:29,230
Mehrunes Dagon.

1194
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:36,070
If the amulet is truly the key to restoring the barriers between our world and oblivion, you must waste no time in recovering it.

1195
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:39,610
Supposed to be a mix of Japan and Rome with some jungles mixed in?

1196
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:42,270
But somehow it ended up as Lord of the Rings.

1197
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,950
I haven't always been a priest.

1198
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,190
In my youth, I followed a different path.

1199
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:48,810
What's that?

1200
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:52,190
I know more than I want to about the seductive power of Daedric magic.

1201
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,970
Let's just leave it at that.

1202
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,350
Are you trying to seduce me, Brother Martin?

1203
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:08,950
Something has changed to make these stable portals to oblivion possible.

1204
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:09,970
They're getting help.

1205
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:13,910
Joppa believes that the death of the emperor and the darkening of the dragon fires is the key.

1206
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:14,210
Oh.

1207
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:16,990
They're getting help.

1208
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,790
They're getting help.

1209
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,770
Don't worry about me, my friend.

1210
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:23,810
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1211
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:24,850
I know I'm in good hands.

1212
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:25,130
Ma'am.

1213
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:25,590
Hi.

1214
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:26,610
Hi.

1215
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,090
Hello.

1216
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:30,790
Wait.

1217
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,250
Where are you going?

1218
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,530
Good evening, mom.

1219
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,530
Good evening.

1220
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,310
Where are you going?

1221
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:36,690
Let's follow him.

1222
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,650
I want to see his room.

1223
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:38,410
Ma'am.

1224
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,590
Ma'am.

1225
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:40,730
Ma'am.

1226
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:42,790
Whoa!

1227
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,990
Wow, you got in here so fast.

1228
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,830
You're not actually reading this.

1229
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,310
Don't...

1230
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,250
Wow!

1231
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:57,230
They gave you the biggest slab of me I've ever seen in my entire afterlife.

1232
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,730
There's so many books here.

1233
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,490
Brief history of the empire volume.

1234
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,470
Legend of Cradley house.

1235
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,030
What's that?

1236
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,390
I like legends.

1237
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:12,290
Oh my gosh.

1238
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,870
Phil, thank you so much for the...

1239
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:14,370
Thank you.

1240
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,170
Thank you.

1241
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:16,710
Thank you.

1242
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:17,570
Thank you.

1243
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,230
Is that me?

1244
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:19,810
Oh, sorry.

1245
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,050
Did I hit my mic again?

1246
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,350
Let me rawl.

1247
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:24,290
Oh my gosh.

1248
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,210
Wait, it's a...

1249
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:25,270
Play.

1250
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,810
Imperial Man 24th Thief.

1251
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,050
The famous...

1252
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:30,310
Haunted...

1253
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:31,850
Cradley house?

1254
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:33,670
Oh, oh.

1255
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,650
Requiring a stage with a second story where most of the action takes place.

1256
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,670
The stage is dark.

1257
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,530
There's a creaking noise.

1258
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,330
Footsteps on the stairs.

1259
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:44,730
The sound of a man breathing.

1260
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,170
But still, we see nothing.

1261
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,750
Then a voice calls from above.

1262
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,170
Hello.

1263
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:50,290
Hello.

1264
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,070
Is someone down there?

1265
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,770
Should I wake Papal?

1266
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:55,790
No.

1267
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,290
Maybe I was imagining.

1268
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,230
This is 25 pages.

1269
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,630
Oh my gosh.

1270
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,400
The night they were murdered.

1271
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,160
Is this an autobiography?

1272
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,200
They'll just assume it's the ghosts.

1273
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,370
The curtain falls.

1274
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,730
Ten commandments.

1275
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:29,710
Nine divines.

1276
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,270
They say that all the time.

1277
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,270
Who's mysterious Akavir.

1278
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,730
Akavir means Dragon Land.

1279
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,070
Tamriel means Dawn's Beauty.

1280
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:41,910
Atmora means Elderwood.

1281
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,370
Only the Red Guards know what Yokuda ever meant.

1282
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,650
Big minky love.

1283
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:49,850
Thank you.

1284
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,600
Akavir is the kingdom of the beasts.

1285
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,740
No men or mer live in Akavir.

1286
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,600
Though men once did.

1287
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,720
Vampires?

1288
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,540
Snow hell?

1289
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:09,680
Demons?

1290
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:14,960
Uh.

1291
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,540
These men, however, were eaten long ago by the vampiric serpent folk of...

1292
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,340
Seis.

1293
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:24,800
Tasty.

1294
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,500
Real Berenziah is basically your smut audio books.

1295
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:30,920
Wait, what?

1296
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,280
Which one?

1297
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:37,710
Where?

1298
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,550
Wait, this one?

1299
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:40,370
No.

1300
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,010
Biography of Berenziah?

1301
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,910
No, no, no.

1302
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,230
No.

1303
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:45,110
No, no, no.

1304
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,960
Biography of Berenziah?

1305
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,060
That one?

1306
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,400
It's censored?

1307
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,620
No kidding.

1308
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,020
Oh.

1309
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,960
Oh my god!

1310
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,760
You scared me.

1311
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:08,720
Oh.

1312
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,520
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1313
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,280
Good afternoon.

1314
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,290
They're chomping.

1315
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:22,710
Good evening, ma'am.

1316
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:23,450
Good evening.

1317
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:24,710
Oh my god.

1318
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:25,930
Oh.

1319
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:27,830
Oh.

1320
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,170
Oh.

1321
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:28,610
Oh, that...

1322
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,690
Oh.

1323
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,030
Oh my god.

1324
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,750
She will love the lusty Argo...

1325
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,850
Argo...

1326
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:40,710
Argo...

1327
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:42,530
Argonian maid.

1328
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,410
Yeah, I know about that one.

1329
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,660
Only because, uh...

1330
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:49,650
Um...

1331
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,490
Mogu...

1332
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:51,550
Told me about it.

1333
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:56,340
So this one?

1334
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,260
37 pages.

1335
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,380
And that's vault...

1336
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,360
42 pages!

1337
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,060
42 pages!

1338
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:06,600
6...

1339
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,140
I just spat out my...

1340
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,660
I was in such shock.

1341
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,880
I spat out my...

1342
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,680
My...

1343
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,720
Cough drop.

1344
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,450
Can I get...

1345
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,870
Can I get...

1346
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:26,390
Can I get...

1347
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,730
A TLDR?

1348
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:30,830
What are you reading?

1349
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,420
I brought him here though.

1350
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,240
I feel like I should be able to look into anything that I want.

1351
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,640
How are you?

1352
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:41,300
How are you?

1353
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:47,000
The real Baron Zaya on the table.

1354
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,280
Oh!

1355
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,840
But it's been censored though.

1356
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:51,720
Is that what people said?

1357
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,880
Thank you so much for the redirect!

1358
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:55,720
Thank you!

1359
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:56,860
Thank you!

1360
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,360
Thank you!

1361
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:02,990
Oh!

1362
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,530
But this is volume 4.

1363
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:04,970
It's okay.

1364
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,930
Everything I have ever loved, I have lost.

1365
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,150
Baron Zaya thought, despondently.

1366
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,050
Looking at the mountain knights behind and ahead.

1367
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,130
Her tired woman near her in a carriage.

1368
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,530
Yet I have gained a measure of wealth and power.

1369
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:26,610
And the promise of more to come.

1370
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,630
Dearly have I bought it.

1371
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,590
Now I do understand better.

1372
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,990
T-Tiber Septon's love of it.

1373
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,810
If he had often paid such prices.

1374
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,970
For surely worth is measured by the price we pay.

1375
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,070
Do I go thank you so much for the fight?

1376
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,070
Good to thank you!

1377
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:49,530
By her wish she rode on a shiny roan mare.

1378
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:54,670
Clad as a warrior in resplendent chain mail of dark elven make.

1379
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,530
When does it get...

1380
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,530
When does it get...

1381
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,020
The kiss.

1382
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,300
Marry me, Baron Zaya!

1383
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,340
I don't even know who this is.

1384
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:29,080
Oh my gosh.

1385
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,240
She seemed to have picked up her thoughts on marriage, children, wives.

1386
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,140
Oh my god.

1387
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,900
Oh my god.

1388
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,640
Symmachus.

1389
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,460
Oh my god.

1390
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,200
There was work and there was pleasure.

1391
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,420
And what more could one ask of life?

1392
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,820
Wait, is this the last book?

1393
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,520
Of, of, uh, of, uh, oh.

1394
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,520
That peasant obeys whoever holds power.

1395
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,460
Always has, always will.

1396
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,220
We shall hold the power, milady love.

1397
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,920
His lips were sweetest wine.

1398
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,220
His touch.

1399
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,020
Both fire and ice.

1400
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,680
Now, she said.

1401
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,000
Take me now!

1402
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,180
I'm ready!

1403
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:41,740
Her body seemed to hum every nerve and muscle taut.

1404
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,080
Not yet.

1405
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,280
Not here.

1406
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,800
Not like this.

1407
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,270
Oh my goodness.

1408
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,570
The wall dissolved.

1409
01:05:59,470 --> 01:05:59,910
Uh-oh.

1410
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:02,770
What's the...

1411
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:06,950
Does it end on a cliffhanger?

1412
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,970
Gosh, they're really chomping away.

1413
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,490
Alright, let's explore this place.

1414
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,170
Just a little bit.

1415
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:16,470
Then I'll go talk to...

1416
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,350
Joffrey.

1417
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,610
You can meet her?

1418
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:23,790
I don't...

1419
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:25,170
Ma'am?

1420
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:25,970
Ma'am?

1421
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:26,750
Caroline?

1422
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:28,690
What can I do for you, ma'am?

1423
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:33,330
There's no place more secure in all of Cyrodiil.

1424
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,490
I just wish...

1425
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:35,810
Yeah.

1426
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,910
I wish we could have gotten our Lord Uriel here.

1427
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:41,310
Yeah.

1428
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:45,290
The Emperor's death was a harsh lesson for all of us.

1429
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:48,070
We failed in our duty to the Dragonborn.

1430
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:49,010
Joffrey.

1431
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:50,010
It must not happen again.

1432
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,210
So true, lady.

1433
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,590
May Talos guide you.

1434
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:54,070
Thank you.

1435
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:56,870
Joffrey.

1436
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,750
Hold on.

1437
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:58,790
Oh, look at them!

1438
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,330
Oh!

1439
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:00,310
You missed.

1440
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:01,850
You missed.

1441
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:03,830
Oh!

1442
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:10,630
Oh, you got him.

1443
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:13,490
Nice.

1444
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,950
Wait, can I be in there?

1445
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:32,190
Oh, sorry.

1446
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:33,310
Ma'am?

1447
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,290
Ma'am?

1448
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:35,470
Get out of the way, ma'am.

1449
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:37,870
Woo!

1450
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,230
They're training hard.

1451
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,810
Look at them go!

1452
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:46,270
Ma'am?

1453
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,110
Wait, there's blood on the ground here.

1454
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,290
Oh, my gosh.

1455
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,190
Oh, my gosh.

1456
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,030
I guess they, uh...

1457
01:07:58,030 --> 01:07:58,550
You know...

1458
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:02,610
By observing these blades of practice, you've picked up a couple of new moves.

1459
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,450
Your blade and block skills have both been raised by two points.

1460
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:07,290
Wow!

1461
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,210
It pays...

1462
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,730
To be observant.

1463
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:14,450
Wow!

1464
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,170
That's crazy.

1465
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,910
All you need to understand is...

1466
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:21,290
Wait, what?

1467
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,510
Is the...

1468
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:27,230
This world is a dream, and when the dreamer wakes up, it is gone.

1469
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:28,390
What?

1470
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:30,670
Ha?

1471
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,050
Hail.

1472
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:32,690
Hail.

1473
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,650
Nah, it's sucking.

1474
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:35,690
Oh.

1475
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:36,810
What was that?

1476
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:38,810
Something just fell...

1477
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:38,910
Oh.

1478
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:39,750
Oh, no.

1479
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:40,590
I think it's snow.

1480
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,310
It's not hail at all.

1481
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,490
I want to go see what that is.

1482
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:53,850
Which one's my horse?

1483
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,150
Wait, where's my horse?

1484
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:56,510
Uh-oh.

1485
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,830
Still outside, probably.

1486
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,960
We will check it out.

1487
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,000
But first...

1488
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,060
I want to check out a little bit in here.

1489
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,340
By the way, the book censored is the real Barren Zaya Volume 2.

1490
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,600
Aw, man.

1491
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,660
Why'd they censor it?

1492
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,460
What's he reading?

1493
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,160
I haven't time to talk right now, I'm afraid.

1494
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,440
But I'm sure one of the other blades can help.

1495
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:26,300
Try speaking with Belisarius or Caroline.

1496
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,600
Oh.

1497
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,980
Okay, Baragon.

1498
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,580
You're not even...

1499
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,260
He's angrily looking at me.

1500
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,180
While he turned the page.

1501
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,960
You're not even reading it.

1502
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,240
Baragon.

1503
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,200
Sure.

1504
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,640
Sure.

1505
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:41,820
Sure.

1506
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,060
Well, then he won't notice if I look in here.

1507
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,000
I'm just looking.

1508
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,440
I'm just looking.

1509
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,940
I'm just looking.

1510
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,220
I don't have time right now.

1511
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,480
I'm too busy reading...

1512
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,080
The real Barren Zaya Volume 2.

1513
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:04,600
Hail.

1514
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,320
Hail.

1515
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,100
What's it?

1516
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:06,300
Oh.

1517
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:07,860
Whoa.

1518
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:09,540
Whoa.

1519
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:10,840
Whoa.

1520
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:11,660
Whoa.

1521
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,700
I'm just looking.

1522
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,720
How cute.

1523
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,380
I wish I had a shirt like that.

1524
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:50,890
Hail.

1525
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:51,750
Hail.

1526
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,050
Don't mind me.

1527
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:55,370
Oh.

1528
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,900
That looks like...

1529
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,540
What I throw in my...

1530
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,240
Dryer.

1531
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:24,910
It's fine.

1532
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:26,710
I brought the new emperor here.

1533
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,390
I should be rewarded.

1534
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,450
I should be rewarded.

1535
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,810
I brought him here.

1536
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,970
Oh.

1537
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:37,570
They should be kissing my feet.

1538
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:41,330
Oh.

1539
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:42,590
The old emperor.

1540
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:44,250
Volume...

1541
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,230
Seven?

1542
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:57,550
Anyway.

1543
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:58,730
Hail.

1544
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,750
Yep.

1545
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:01,590
Me too.

1546
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,970
Oh.

1547
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:02,790
Oh.

1548
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:03,850
Poor sucker.

1549
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:04,550
Who is this?

1550
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,090
Who has to sleep in here?

1551
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:08,050
Whoa.

1552
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:11,790
Gosh.

1553
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,570
I wish I had a katana like that.

1554
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,130
Gosh.

1555
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:27,150
It looks so nice.

1556
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,770
I wish I had a katana like that.

1557
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:32,350
Ma'am.

1558
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:33,050
Ma'am.

1559
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,140
You can get a free one from Joffrey?

1560
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:41,880
How do I get out of this?

1561
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,100
Wait.

1562
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:42,540
Where am I?

1563
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:43,460
Oh.

1564
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:44,120
I went to their...

1565
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:44,940
I went to their room.

1566
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:45,540
Wait.

1567
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,020
Oh.

1568
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,080
Oh.

1569
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:51,850
Whoa.

1570
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:54,630
What was that?

1571
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:55,070
Oh.

1572
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,110
I didn't do that.

1573
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,430
That fell all on its own.

1574
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,700
Let's go talk to Joffrey.

1575
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,460
We'll get ours legally.

1576
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,140
Oh.

1577
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,700
Are you still so busy, Baragon?

1578
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,020
Damn.

1579
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:13,920
He's chugging that.

1580
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,010
Slow down, buddy.

1581
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:20,950
Slow down.

1582
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,330
He needs to savor the flavor.

1583
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,330
Oh my god.

1584
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:27,230
Baragon has a problem.

1585
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,230
It's me.

1586
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:30,930
No clock.

1587
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,860
Hello, Joffrey.

1588
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:38,820
I have a question.

1589
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,540
You have proven yourself a loyal servant of the Empire.

1590
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,680
As worthy as any of the Blades to stand by Martin's side during this crisis.

1591
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,120
Thank you.

1592
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,600
As the Grand Master of the Blades, I would be honored to accept you into our order.

1593
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,340
Will you join us?

1594
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:53,540
Oh.

1595
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:54,720
What?

1596
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:54,960
Yeah.

1597
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:55,760
What are my duties?

1598
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:02,500
The Blades are sworn to the service of the Emperor as the mortal representative of the Dragon Blood of the Divine Talos.

1599
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,320
Okay, but there's this guy named Gray Fox.

1600
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,020
I want to join him, too.

1601
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,960
Will you join the anime club?

1602
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:18,930
You can do both?

1603
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:19,810
Thank you.

1604
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,320
I will join the Blades.

1605
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,240
It is my honor to welcome you into our ranks as a knight sister of the Blades.

1606
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,280
I'll join everything.

1607
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,880
I got a katana!

1608
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,420
Keep your heart true, and your eyes open.

1609
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,000
It really...

1610
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,260
Good evening, ma'am.

1611
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,300
I'm one of...

1612
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:44,860
Good evening, ma'am.

1613
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:45,180
Oh.

1614
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,500
Good evening.

1615
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:47,880
I'm one of you now.

1616
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,400
Wow!

1617
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,380
Wow!

1618
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,580
Does this count as, like, a slight...

1619
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,160
Like, well...

1620
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,820
I guess it doesn't count as, like, a...

1621
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,060
You know, uh...

1622
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,810
Yeah, it's a long sword.

1623
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:21,350
Yeah.

1624
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:23,250
Sad.

1625
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,270
It's okay, though.

1626
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,810
It's okay.

1627
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,490
Let's put our...

1628
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:33,810
When did I...

1629
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:34,570
Oh, yeah.

1630
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,910
That's right.

1631
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:35,830
I got this other one.

1632
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,910
The enchanted one.

1633
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,110
I've got my fist up.

1634
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:43,770
Wait, so now can I take...

1635
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:44,650
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

1636
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:47,130
It will be an honor to serve with you.

1637
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,670
Can I take everything in here now?

1638
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:52,430
I can wear their armor.

1639
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:54,450
I could be...

1640
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:55,510
Oh, I really can!

1641
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:56,730
Hail!

1642
01:15:58,210 --> 01:15:58,690
Achilles!

1643
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:01,670
I'm still trying to adjust to everything that has happened.

1644
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:04,090
I know.

1645
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,850
You gonna use that, or...

1646
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,360
I actually...

1647
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,340
Oh, sorry.

1648
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,380
I didn't mean to take the plate.

1649
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,340
My finger slipped.

1650
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,380
I just gotta, you know, a little...

1651
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,080
I just...

1652
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:28,660
Oh, here you go.

1653
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:29,580
You can have it back, too.

1654
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,760
Hello, my friend.

1655
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,600
Where did it come from?

1656
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,480
The plate is...

1657
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,680
Good minerals, maybe.

1658
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:41,580
Probably.

1659
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,200
I feel like the armor will be too heavy for me, though, no?

1660
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,200
Hail!

1661
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:48,980
Hail!

1662
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,580
Please forgive me, but I'm afraid I haven't got time to talk right now.

1663
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,200
Oh, gosh.

1664
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:55,900
Baragon.

1665
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,440
Baragon, we really gotta talk to you about...

1666
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,100
That guy's not okay.

1667
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:05,840
Okay!

1668
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,440
I want to...

1669
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,040
I want to...

1670
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,720
I want to...

1671
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,840
Well, there's my horse.

1672
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:19,860
Quests.

1673
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,220
Finding the thieves' guild.

1674
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,400
So we must...

1675
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,040
Go to...

1676
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,660
The garden of...

1677
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,740
Derloth.

1678
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,460
Let's do it.

1679
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,780
And then, I also wanna kill that guy at the inn.

1680
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,960
I wanna do all the freaky stuff.

1681
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,960
Where is it, though?

1682
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:46,960
Where we gotta go?

1683
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:49,880
Oh, here?

1684
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,040
I have to go to the...

1685
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,200
Wait.

1686
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:55,520
Is this...

1687
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:55,880
It?

1688
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,570
No, this is a Cloud Ruler Temple.

1689
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:02,130
What the heck?

1690
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:04,970
Hmm.

1691
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:07,930
I don't know.

1692
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:09,010
Should we do this one first?

1693
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,690
Or should we do...

1694
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:11,130
Let's see, actually, which one is closer.

1695
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,930
Knife in the dark.

1696
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,030
Oh.

1697
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,150
It's way further.

1698
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,150
So we'll...

1699
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,730
We'll join the...

1700
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:25,310
Thieves' guild on our way to joining...

1701
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,530
On our way to...

1702
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,650
Knifing that guy.

1703
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:32,630
There we go.

1704
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:36,500
Oh.

1705
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:36,640
Okay.

1706
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,160
The Imperial City, I feel, wasn't so far away.

1707
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,780
And then...

1708
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:44,240
Oh my gosh.

1709
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,140
Who knows how many quests are in here?

1710
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,440
Someone described...

1711
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:49,780
The...

1712
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,160
Oh.

1713
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,900
The Elder Scroll games as big plays.

1714
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,880
And that all NPCs are actors playing a bit for the player.

1715
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,380
Even the cosmic lore hints this.

1716
01:18:58,860 --> 01:18:59,260
Oh.

1717
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,140
That's neat.

1718
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,120
Quap,

1719
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:08,450
quap, quap.

1720
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,670
Yeah, what part of that was in the script?

1721
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,530
Quap, quap, quap, quap,

1722
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:19,590
quap.

1723
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,310
I want to go in, but...

1724
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,090
I want to go in...

1725
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,350
But my horse, I'd have to come back...

1726
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:27,650
You know what?

1727
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,470
Let's do this.

1728
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,310
We'll ride to the other side.

1729
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:33,430
And then I can go in and explore for a little bit.

1730
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:34,370
And then we can...

1731
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:37,790
Just leave where we came and...

1732
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,310
Pick up our horse.

1733
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:43,670
The quap, quap was part of the script.

1734
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:45,070
Oh.

1735
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:47,430
It must be like a secret meaning.

1736
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,110
We just are so...

1737
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:50,670
We are so uncultured.

1738
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:52,090
We don't understand it.

1739
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:57,510
Yeah, it feels very Truman Show.

1740
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:57,870
No.

1741
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,350
That kind of description.

1742
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,230
That's freaky.

1743
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,790
What are they going to start advertising?

1744
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:11,850
Hello, everybody.

1745
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:13,190
I'm listening.

1746
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:13,750
Nah.

1747
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:16,470
Greetings.

1748
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,110
What exactly do you require of me?

1749
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,550
What's going on with you?

1750
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:24,050
They say that slavery has been abolished in Morrowind.

1751
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:30,110
House Dress and Lalu have renounced the slave trade and freed the beast folk from servitude.

1752
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:34,250
It seems that these are turbulent times in the land of the Dunmer.

1753
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,430
Take care.

1754
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:36,590
What?

1755
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:37,330
What?

1756
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,650
That's what I'm asking you.

1757
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,030
What?

1758
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:42,650
There was slavery?

1759
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:45,650
Also...

1760
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:46,370
How are you?

1761
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:46,910
Hi.

1762
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:48,210
Good evening.

1763
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,690
That guy was walking around with short sleeves.

1764
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,790
How is he not so cold?

1765
01:20:58,840 --> 01:20:59,420
Uh-oh.

1766
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,420
It's so night, though.

1767
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,080
Like, it's starting to get pretty dark.

1768
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:07,780
They won't want to talk to us or let us shop or...

1769
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,480
Here, let's just go into this person's house.

1770
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,980
A true north man.

1771
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,120
That's true.

1772
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:14,720
Oh.

1773
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:15,600
Hello.

1774
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,420
Can't you see that I'm upset?

1775
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:17,800
Oh.

1776
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:18,920
You are?

1777
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,040
I can't help myself.

1778
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,520
I'm just a sucker for well-heeled men.

1779
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,780
That Ola, for example, at the Tap and Tack.

1780
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,720
He's dreamy.

1781
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,580
And successful, too.

1782
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,660
Ola...

1783
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:36,220
Anyone looking for work should consider the Fighters Guild.

1784
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:39,080
I hear they're always looking for recruits.

1785
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:39,940
Okay.

1786
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,400
Why is she upset?

1787
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,320
Good riddance.

1788
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,860
Why are you mad?

1789
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,780
What happened to you?

1790
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,900
Why is she so mad?

1791
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:55,900
Why are you upset?

1792
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,520
Damn, I really missed out on that plot line, huh?

1793
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,820
Steal her cup.

1794
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:08,300
Let's go to the Tap and Tack.

1795
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,500
It's you.

1796
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,520
Hi.

1797
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:12,940
What?

1798
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,740
Do I have a reputation here already?

1799
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,210
Ola, Ola, Ola.

1800
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:23,170
Let's meet this guy.

1801
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,690
He's dreamy, apparently.

1802
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:28,830
Okay.

1803
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:30,050
There's three people here.

1804
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:32,290
Okay.

1805
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:34,430
Which one do you think is Ola?

1806
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:37,450
They're all looking at me.

1807
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,690
They're not even eating.

1808
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,150
Or conversing.

1809
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:41,830
Or anything.

1810
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:44,930
Middle back.

1811
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:45,930
That guy over there.

1812
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:48,330
Right?

1813
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:49,990
Nope.

1814
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,490
This is Surutan.

1815
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:53,470
Oh my gosh, how cute.

1816
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:54,610
Surutan!

1817
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:56,730
Okay.

1818
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:57,710
So it's not him.

1819
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:02,870
This guy is so dreamy.

1820
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:03,990
This has got to be him.

1821
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:04,870
Today's your lucky day.

1822
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:05,530
Oh my god, it is!

1823
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:06,110
Don't let's hear it.

1824
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:07,270
What?

1825
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:07,590
Hello!

1826
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:08,610
Hello.

1827
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,270
This is him.

1828
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:12,610
He looks like Fabio.

1829
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:14,630
What can I do for you today?

1830
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:16,850
You know what?

1831
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,530
Now that you mentioned the play...

1832
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,110
Every time I click on a character...

1833
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,550
It's like a spotlight comes down from the heavens.

1834
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:24,970
And like...

1835
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:26,470
And like...

1836
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:28,270
And shines on their face.

1837
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:30,950
The Countess is Heartland Nibinean.

1838
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,950
And so are most guildsmen and chapelmen.

1839
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:37,090
But most others are as Nordish as you'll find.

1840
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,790
Alga sure can tell a good story.

1841
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:47,610
I'm not normally a big fan of Bard's tales, but she's got some good ones.

1842
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:48,910
Do you think he's into me?

1843
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,050
I've got a room and a cheap one at that.

1844
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:53,330
You're looking for one?

1845
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:53,930
No.

1846
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,050
All right.

1847
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,470
All right.

1848
01:23:58,370 --> 01:23:58,730
The...

1849
01:23:58,730 --> 01:23:59,510
Oh, we can...

1850
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:00,210
We can...

1851
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:00,990
Barter with him.

1852
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:02,790
So?

1853
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,730
Good journey to you.

1854
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:06,870
So he'll buy our stuff.

1855
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:07,490
That's good.

1856
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:11,650
Greetings to you.

1857
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:12,490
Oh my gosh.

1858
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:13,890
What's upstairs?

1859
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,430
Oh, but I can open this.

1860
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:19,850
Oh, I can't be lockpicked.

1861
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:20,350
Dang.

1862
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:23,070
Oh my gosh.

1863
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:25,650
Doesn't even have a TV.

1864
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:26,910
You don't even...

1865
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:28,690
Guide to Bruma.

1866
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:29,290
Cute.

1867
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:33,930
What else you got?

1868
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:35,210
Okay.

1869
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,170
No toilet.

1870
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:37,670
Yeah.

1871
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:39,190
Hello.

1872
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,350
How much would...

1873
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:40,830
I take it, you want.

1874
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:41,350
Nope.

1875
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,530
No Wi-Fi.

1876
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:47,210
Oh.

1877
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:48,530
Oh.

1878
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:50,510
What's she up to?

1879
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,410
She looks suspicious.

1880
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,470
I take it you want something.

1881
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:55,830
Well, what is it?

1882
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:56,450
Well, you're...

1883
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:57,470
What can I do for you?

1884
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,050
You're running away.

1885
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:58,930
What are you doing?

1886
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:00,490
Hey.

1887
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:04,150
You're the one they call the Hero of Kvatch, aren't you?

1888
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:08,290
The one that closed the Oblivion Gate and saved the city?

1889
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,330
Oh, quick save so you can get better social.

1890
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:12,150
Oh.

1891
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:12,590
Oh.

1892
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:16,150
The guy looks like the prince from Shrek 2.

1893
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,310
Oh my gosh, he does.

1894
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:18,490
Take care.

1895
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:20,290
I'm the hero of Kvatch.

1896
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:22,950
I'm the hero.

1897
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:23,770
I'm the hero.

1898
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:26,130
I'm the hero.

1899
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:27,930
I'm the hero.

1900
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:30,810
I'm the hero.

1901
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:32,870
Hammer and axe.

1902
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:40,290
This city is way less dizzying than Skingrad.

1903
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:42,930
I think I just don't like Skingrad.

1904
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:46,010
Nova Roma.

1905
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:47,930
Oh, that must be like a...

1906
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,640
Magic.

1907
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,680
Hey, why are you putting hero in quotes?

1908
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,740
I saved that town.

1909
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,440
Yes, I did.

1910
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,000
They're so rude to me.

1911
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:10,720
You don't know you're talking...

1912
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,280
How can I help you?

1913
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,800
You don't know that you're talking to a hero.

1914
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:14,840
I'm that mean.

1915
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,040
Hello?

1916
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:31,350
One more coin and I can get a pair of shoes.

1917
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,800
Did you ever hear about the ghost of Lord Vlindril?

1918
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,740
They say he haunts the road to Coral.

1919
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,420
Not that I've ever seen him myself, mind you.

1920
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,080
What?

1921
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:52,940
Where?

1922
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,180
Blessings of a new...

1923
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:55,700
What?

1924
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,740
The road to Coral.

1925
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,420
Where the hell is Coral?

1926
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,020
Here.

1927
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,440
This road?

1928
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,720
Which road?

1929
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:05,980
Which where?

1930
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,440
A ghost?

1931
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:09,660
I must...

1932
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,420
I want...

1933
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,480
We went this whole way, but it was daytime.

1934
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:17,360
The road to Coral.

1935
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,160
This...

1936
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,100
Maybe this one.

1937
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:25,250
A ghost?

1938
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,590
Toss a coin to Armito.

1939
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,910
She saved the Emperor's son and joined the blades.

1940
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,290
Yeah!

1941
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,410
I'm no hero.

1942
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:35,370
Never was.

1943
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:36,270
Never will be.

1944
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:41,450
Going around and telling people I'm not a hero sounds like something not a hero would say.

1945
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:44,390
Wait.

1946
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:48,670
Can you tell me that again?

1947
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:49,230
Wake up.

1948
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:50,830
Wake up.

1949
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:52,450
One more.

1950
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:53,610
Yeah, I'll give you a coin.

1951
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:54,070
Give me a second.

1952
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,930
Did you ever hear about the ghost of Lord Vlindril?

1953
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:57,530
The road to Coral.

1954
01:27:58,810 --> 01:27:59,630
Thank you.

1955
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:01,090
You're welcome.

1956
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:02,430
Thanks for telling me about the ghost.

1957
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,590
Who has things of Akatosh upon you?

1958
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:06,050
I want to go see the ghost.

1959
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:10,510
Oh gosh.

1960
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:11,130
Can I...

1961
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:11,590
Can I...

1962
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:11,730
Oop.

1963
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:12,110
Nice.

1964
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:17,530
Let's get out of this...

1965
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:20,170
What's this...

1966
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,270
Ghost bottom right.

1967
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:26,170
Viguro thank you so much for the coin.

1968
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:26,890
Thank you.

1969
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,410
Let's...

1970
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:31,210
Actually...

1971
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:34,250
Have I been to Coral?

1972
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:37,470
Yes, of course.

1973
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:38,130
No.

1974
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39,750
Actually, I don't think I have.

1975
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,540
I don't think I actually explored Coral.

1976
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:46,900
Yeah, only outside.

1977
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,640
But what we can do...

1978
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,340
Is we can fast travel to...

1979
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,100
Wayne and Priory.

1980
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,540
We would just be going the same way that we went.

1981
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:58,620
And then...

1982
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,260
Let's explore...

1983
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,420
I don't know.

1984
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,740
I don't think this is a quest or anything, but...

1985
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:05,340
Oh, thanks, horse.

1986
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:06,260
Alright, perfect.

1987
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:08,820
This way.

1988
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,040
So...

1989
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,200
We'll just go around...

1990
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:11,780
What time is it?

1991
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,300
Oh, that's the map.

1992
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:15,740
It's 3 a.m.

1993
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:16,000
Okay.

1994
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,700
This is like the perfect time...

1995
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,440
For a ghost to come out.

1996
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,620
Let's see if there's a ghost around here.

1997
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,100
Wait, where the hell am I?

1998
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:36,040
I always press that on accident.

1999
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:37,940
Wait, this way.

2000
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:43,150
No.

2001
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:47,130
Like around here.

2002
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,110
Crumbling mine.

2003
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:53,590
I don't see no crumbling mine, but...

2004
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,610
Okay.

2005
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:58,730
In the original, their voice would change with pay.

2006
01:29:58,910 --> 01:29:59,370
Really?

2007
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,630
Why are they depriving us?

2008
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:03,390
I can't believe they redubbed the whole game.

2009
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:04,030
Oh, that's crazy.

2010
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:05,390
Ghost lore question.

2011
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:07,910
Are maith ghosts the same species as pirate ghosts?

2012
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,110
Oh, maybe here.

2013
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,730
Can you change class at will?

2014
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:19,290
Or is made ghosts like a regional species thing?

2015
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:25,570
Wait, I think that's a bandit.

2016
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:26,750
That's not a ghost.

2017
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:30,030
Uh-oh.

2018
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:31,810
No, my fist!

2019
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:35,770
Um, I could change if I felt like it.

2020
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,210
Like, why would I change?

2021
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:42,770
He's about to be the ghost.

2022
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:47,830
Oh, my God.

2023
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,650
What just happened to him?

2024
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:51,450
Oh, shoot!

2025
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,790
You've buffed yourself for no reason.

2026
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:57,710
Oh, my gosh.

2027
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:58,550
Horse, you scared me.

2028
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:00,390
What, do you want his mace?

2029
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:04,390
Do you want his mace?

2030
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:07,690
Alright.

2031
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:10,170
We're looking around for a ghost, guys.

2032
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,170
Any ghost?

2033
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:19,110
Watch this not be a real thing.

2034
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:24,910
Watch this not be a thing at all.

2035
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:29,690
My athletics have increased.

2036
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,600
Now, there are lots of rumors around here, huh?

2037
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,780
I just want to see it before it becomes...

2038
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:43,680
Daytime.

2039
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:52,890
My eyes are peeled.

2040
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:53,930
I'm...

2041
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:55,050
There are dark everywhere.

2042
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:57,030
I'm looking all over.

2043
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,050
For this ghost.

2044
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,100
Maybe not this road.

2045
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:10,980
He can be hard to spy if your timing is wrong.

2046
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,340
Took me a few nights to see him.

2047
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,180
No kidding!

2048
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,320
Wait, what's this up here?

2049
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,280
Oh.

2050
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:20,280
Just a rock.

2051
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:23,740
What?

2052
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:24,420
Oh.

2053
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,780
You cannot wait when there are enemies nearby.

2054
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,260
What do you mean by that?

2055
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,320
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2056
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:38,780
Huh?

2057
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:47,270
Of enemies nearby?

2058
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:48,250
Of enemies nearby?

2059
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,310
Where?

2060
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:53,770
Huh?

2061
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:57,370
Red arrow?

2062
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,630
No, no.

2063
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:00,350
Not that.

2064
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:03,170
What?

2065
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:04,810
Um...

2066
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:06,450
Huh?

2067
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:10,570
She doesn't see them.

2068
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:11,370
What am I seeing?

2069
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:12,570
What am I supposed to be seeing?

2070
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:14,970
Is it a little crab again?

2071
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:20,130
I just want to know what time it is.

2072
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:21,610
I think we missed the ghost.

2073
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:23,550
Aw, man.

2074
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:34,090
Aw, man.

2075
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,570
In the trees?

2076
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,470
There's still enemies!

2077
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:01,830
I don't...

2078
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,800
I'm so confused.

2079
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,850
I just want to know what time it is.

2080
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,840
Oh, there's a dog over there, I think.

2081
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:26,980
Is that a dog?

2082
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:28,940
Dog...

2083
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:30,000
Or rock?

2084
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:30,680
It's a dog.

2085
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,380
Three times damage.

2086
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:56,880
Hmm...

2087
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,120
Hmm...

2088
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:04,220
Well, if we can explore the city and then wait until nighttime again...

2089
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:05,980
And come back...

2090
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:08,960
I wonder, though...

2091
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,780
I wonder...

2092
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,940
What time would be best, though?

2093
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,020
Hmm...

2094
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:16,980
Wait...

2095
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,720
Now see it'll let me check now.

2096
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,200
6 am...

2097
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:21,680
Maybe the...

2098
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,640
Maybe it was the wolf.

2099
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:23,840
6 am.

2100
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:26,060
Yeah.

2101
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:31,160
Into...

2102
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:31,640
Coral!

2103
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,340
Let me in.

2104
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,780
I just want to see...

2105
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,620
I just want to see the ghost.

2106
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,260
That's so fascinating.

2107
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,060
Oh...

2108
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:48,800
Oh...

2109
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,140
I thought it was...

2110
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,220
I thought it was...

2111
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:55,000
You know those, like, medieval things where you...

2112
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:55,790
Well, okay...

2113
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:57,450
First I thought...

2114
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:57,790
It was...

2115
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:06,180
Uh...

2116
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,080
Uh...

2117
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:09,560
Yeah, well...

2118
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:10,180
A guillotine.

2119
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:10,540
Yeah, yeah.

2120
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,940
First I thought it was a guillotine.

2121
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,440
And then I thought it was...

2122
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:15,060
The gallows.

2123
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,280
A gallow.

2124
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:19,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2125
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:19,880
Yeah.

2126
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,440
Tiding citizen.

2127
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,380
Oh, hello.

2128
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:25,360
Oh, hello.

2129
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,360
One second.

2130
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,080
I'm going to try something real quick, you guys.

2131
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,500
I kind of want to have some, like, mood lighting with this...

2132
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,060
Game.

2133
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:33,740
Let's try it.

2134
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:34,920
Hopefully it...

2135
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,380
Doesn't make me lag so much.

2136
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,280
Let's try it, though.

2137
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:45,250
I feel like it'll help.

2138
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:46,590
It'll match the vibe.

2139
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,250
Cause when I was, like, all lit up...

2140
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,420
Some...

2141
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:01,810
Say...

2142
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:02,740
My name?

2143
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:03,560
Oh.

2144
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:03,920
Greetings.

2145
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:05,760
Maybe.

2146
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,200
Tidings citizen.

2147
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,120
Tidings.

2148
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:12,400
Good morning.

2149
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,560
Good mor...

2150
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:14,940
Whoa.

2151
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,960
What is going on here?

2152
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,880
Wow, you guys didn't take care of your stat...

2153
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,000
Or your fountain at all.

2154
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:26,940
Oh.

2155
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:30,440
He's got no shirt on.

2156
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,680
Why don't you lose the shirt?

2157
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:38,060
It's a pretty statue.

2158
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,260
Oh my gosh.

2159
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,260
Wait, it's so pretty.

2160
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,100
The mountains behind.

2161
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,780
I saw the other day...

2162
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:46,080
I don't know.

2163
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,000
It probably showed up in your guys' feed, too.

2164
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,120
Um...

2165
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,100
The cosplay group of the...

2166
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:53,420
Of the...

2167
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:54,540
Um...

2168
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:55,320
The group that were...

2169
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,260
They were cosplaying the...

2170
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:01,200
The statue versions of...

2171
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:02,900
Freerun...

2172
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:03,680
Characters.

2173
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:13,310
So rude!

2174
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:18,730
It was so pretty.

2175
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:20,870
I'm a high-time titty.

2176
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:22,750
You want something, I guess.

2177
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:24,930
Or you wouldn't be messing up my air.

2178
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:25,690
I'm just...

2179
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:26,890
I'm just saying hi.

2180
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:30,050
Yeah, I used to be fighters guild here in Coral.

2181
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:33,610
But I've done some incarceration for trespassing and theft.

2182
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:34,850
Couple of times.

2183
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:39,030
You know, they kick you out of the guild if you get caught doing some incarceration.

2184
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:40,350
How many?

2185
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:41,190
I forget.

2186
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:42,650
But I did a lot.

2187
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:45,810
Oh, I wanna be your friend.

2188
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,030
Say what you're going to say.

2189
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:48,770
I wanna be your friend!

2190
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:52,050
Not to say someone say my name, but autocorrect after me.

2191
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:54,570
It's okay.

2192
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:55,790
Someone...

2193
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,010
Someone did save me.

2194
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:58,450
What?

2195
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:09,190
Sons.

2196
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:17,090
They're going to fight off the creatures at our farm, but I fear for their safety.

2197
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:17,610
Oh no!

2198
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:19,610
Wait, this quest?

2199
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:21,910
Wait, wait, why are you guys saying, oh no?

2200
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:23,950
Creatures?

2201
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:29,250
For the last few days, we've suffered attacks from these creatures at our farm, not far from Coral.

2202
01:39:29,690 --> 01:39:31,810
They're coming from some place in the Great Forest.

2203
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:35,010
I don't know where, but Rallis may know more by now.

2204
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:38,750
My boys will take up the fight, even if the guards won't!

2205
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:43,570
It doesn't matter if it's outside the town walls, it still affects us all!

2206
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:44,630
I like how...

2207
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:46,170
They expect me to go with them, but I...

2208
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:47,890
All the guys get so, like...

2209
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:49,730
I fear in my old age, I'm not the warrior I once was.

2210
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:52,390
They get so heated so quickly.

2211
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:53,170
Would you...

2212
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:54,130
Would you go in my place?

2213
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:54,950
I don't know you!

2214
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,870
Um, okay.

2215
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:57,550
Somehow?

2216
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:00,070
I knew you'd do the right thing.

2217
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:03,170
I'm supposed to meet them at Wayne and Priory.

2218
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:07,530
You'd best get whatever supplies you need now, so you can get there in time.

2219
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:08,710
I...

2220
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,710
I need a drink to calm my nerves.

2221
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:12,710
Please, excuse me.

2222
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:14,470
Have you seen my sons?

2223
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:15,830
My sons!

2224
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:17,070
Hello!

2225
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:18,670
An honor to serve you.

2226
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:22,970
I'm Imfrid, owner and publican of the Grey Mare at your service.

2227
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:23,370
Oh.

2228
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:24,210
A room?

2229
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,530
Or food?

2230
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:26,830
Whatever you wish.

2231
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:32,750
Ignore the UNO reverse card in my hand.

2232
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,350
It's your birthday tomorrow!

2233
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:37,190
Happy early birthday, resting glitch face!

2234
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:38,810
Happy early birthday!

2235
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:41,210
You...

2236
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:41,970
You...

2237
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:46,570
You've been working hard, and you deserve some rest.

2238
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:48,290
Take it easy.

2239
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:49,790
Take it easy for your birthday!

2240
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:51,850
What the heck is a hack dirt?

2241
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:52,490
Yes.

2242
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:54,670
A small village south of Coral.

2243
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:58,870
Used to be a prosperous mining town, but it has been nearly deserted for years.

2244
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:01,030
Thank you, Minto.

2245
01:41:01,290 --> 01:41:01,790
Of course!

2246
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:05,190
Be seeing ya!

2247
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,190
Oh, sorry.

2248
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,130
Let me take that out.

2249
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:10,670
Average.

2250
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:12,610
I think I could take it.

2251
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:18,400
Hector.

2252
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,640
You've been there before.

2253
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,560
I was gonna say, I think, the name...

2254
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:24,120
Actually, after they mentioned it, it sounded familiar.

2255
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,020
What time is it?

2256
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,020
Oh...

2257
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,460
Hasn't even been...

2258
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,740
One hour.

2259
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,460
A coin for an old beggar?

2260
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,380
Do you know...

2261
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:42,500
You're a mooch!

2262
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:47,960
I'm saving up enough for some medicine.

2263
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,640
Do you...

2264
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,000
What do you know about Gray Fox?

2265
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,760
He's a fairy tale.

2266
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:59,100
The Imperial Watch pretends there is a thief king named the Gray Fox.

2267
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,340
We're gonna find a guy named Leech, I swear.

2268
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:05,340
I swear we're gonna find a guy named Leech.

2269
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,880
I swear we're gonna find a guy named Leech.

2270
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:13,000
I'm thinking of heading over to Renoir's to buy some books.

2271
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,840
There's quite a selection.

2272
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,500
I thought you were saving up for medicine.

2273
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:19,580
Nermis.

2274
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,420
Here, you had me feeling bad for you.

2275
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,540
I was like, oh, the guy just needs some medicine.

2276
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,460
You're off to get books?!

2277
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:29,200
Books?!

2278
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,260
I spit on you.

2279
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:32,860
Patooey!

2280
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,500
Don't talk to me.

2281
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,240
Wow, this city is so stinking cute.

2282
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:45,000
Might be my favorite so far.

2283
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,300
I like the mountains in the background.

2284
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,920
Oh, I thought that said Alberic's little...

2285
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,000
Alberic...

2286
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,080
Alberic's little basement.

2287
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,700
I was like, oh, he's got a little tiny basement.

2288
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,440
Who's here?

2289
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:03,680
Valis' house.

2290
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:12,550
It's my birthday on July 22nd.

2291
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:14,570
That's...what?

2292
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:16,930
It's so far from now.

2293
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:18,970
Celebratory...

2294
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:20,510
Cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop.

2295
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:21,790
Malintis.

2296
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:22,950
Malintis.

2297
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:23,370
How are you doing?

2298
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:30,290
Just telling me we keep an eye on things here in Coral for certain interested parties.

2299
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:34,550
Yeah, you can have a cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop for any time.

2300
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:35,210
Honestly.

2301
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:36,330
Goodbye.

2302
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:37,010
Goodbye.

2303
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:38,570
What you got in here?

2304
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,350
Oh, my God!

2305
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:41,130
Hello?

2306
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:41,850
Hello?

2307
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:44,070
I'm Glistel.

2308
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:45,770
What do you need?

2309
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,690
You were hiding in the shadows.

2310
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,550
You scared me.

2311
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:52,770
My housemate, Malintis Anchris, and I are well known in certain circles here.

2312
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:55,830
But you don't travel in those circles, do you?

2313
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:57,650
What are you saying?

2314
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:01,550
Your housemate's train?

2315
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:03,430
Knowledge is power.

2316
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:05,630
Wait, what?

2317
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:06,790
Oh.

2318
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,690
She can't help me train any higher with sneaking?

2319
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:10,230
No!

2320
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:11,470
No!

2321
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:14,990
Aw, man.

2322
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:16,310
I got money!

2323
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:21,370
I'm too sneaky already.

2324
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:23,680
Followers...

2325
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:28,630
We are the fingers of the fox.

2326
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:32,270
The children of the shadows.

2327
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:35,230
More commonly, we are known as the thieves' guild.

2328
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:36,250
So...

2329
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:40,450
Are the circles that they are in the thieves, maybe?

2330
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:43,230
But...

2331
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:45,970
There are but three rules for followers of the gray fox.

2332
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:50,310
First, never steal from another member of the guild.

2333
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:52,910
Second, never kill anyone on the job.

2334
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:56,830
This is not the Dark Brotherhood!

2335
01:44:58,150 --> 01:45:00,870
Animals and monsters can be slain if necessary.

2336
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:03,130
Third, don't steal from the poor.

2337
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:06,790
The peasants and beggars are under the personal protection of the gray fox.

2338
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:09,790
Particularly in the Imperial City waterfront.

2339
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:13,790
Breaking any of these three rules means expulsion from the thieves' guild.

2340
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:17,870
If you commit murder, you must pay the blood price to rejoin the guild.

2341
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:20,610
Blood price is for each person slain.

2342
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:23,010
You can pay any of the guild...

2343
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:23,830
Doyen.

2344
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:27,270
The Doyen are the hands and eyes of the guild master.

2345
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:29,610
You take your order...

2346
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:29,750
Why?

2347
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:30,590
They're so strict!

2348
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:33,010
I thought we were gonna be like...

2349
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:35,370
This sounds more like Robin Hood.

2350
01:45:39,010 --> 01:45:39,450
Hmm...

2351
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:40,330
Hmm...

2352
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:41,810
Hmm...

2353
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:42,930
Sorry, I'm new here.

2354
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:43,870
Did I just see E.T.

2355
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:44,510
on my screen?

2356
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:45,450
Actually, you saw...

2357
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:49,050
The Chist Not Handy Stables now offers to protect your horse.

2358
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:50,710
Oh, my bad.

2359
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:51,730
Wait, you saw...

2360
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:53,930
You saw E.T.

2361
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:54,430
in a...

2362
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:56,790
It's definitely not E.T.

2363
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:57,590
in a wig.

2364
01:45:58,630 --> 01:45:59,610
But also welcome!

2365
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:02,490
Yeah, this is E.T.

2366
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:05,190
in a...

2367
01:46:16,330 --> 01:46:17,970
Doyen are the hands and eyes of the guild master.

2368
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:19,250
You take your orders from them.

2369
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:20,470
You get your favors from them.

2370
01:46:20,650 --> 01:46:24,890
They can pay off the Imperial judges to remove your crimes!

2371
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:27,090
For a small fee, of course.

2372
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:30,490
I'm in the guild.

2373
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:31,770
It shouldn't cost me anything.

2374
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:34,770
Our guild master is the Gray Fox.

2375
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:36,710
We don't talk about him in public.

2376
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:39,830
However, we make sure that most folks think he is just a myth.

2377
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:44,670
Sometimes if someone's dialogue is still white, they might have more to tell you if they like you more.

2378
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:46,550
Oh, I see!

2379
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:47,910
So that's why.

2380
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,450
Because it was white.

2381
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:51,910
With the beggar guy.

2382
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:52,690
Okay, okay.

2383
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:53,470
With the mooch.

2384
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:54,910
The leech.

2385
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:56,890
We're thieves.

2386
01:46:57,190 --> 01:46:58,950
Not mason or scribes.

2387
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:00,310
Masons or scribes.

2388
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:02,450
Each member steals at his own discretion.

2389
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:05,510
The guild neither helps nor hinders with a burglary.

2390
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:11,570
However, you will find that you can only sell stolen property to one of our guild fences.

2391
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:14,190
Other merchants won't take hot merchandise.

2392
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:15,330
Ooh, hot.

2393
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:16,810
It's hot.

2394
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:23,630
You won't be considered for promotion in the thieves guild unless you have sold enough stolen property to the fences.

2395
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:28,050
The higher in the guild you rise, the more stolen property you need to have fenced.

2396
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:34,450
If you should be called to help the Gray Fox in some special way, remember that the best source of information is the beggars.

2397
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:35,290
Oh!

2398
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:37,490
Their eyes and ears seem to be everywhere.

2399
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:39,990
However, be prepared to spend a little coin.

2400
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:41,970
They won't tell you anything for free.

2401
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:43,370
At least, not anything.

2402
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,270
True.

2403
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:46,330
The guild takes care of its own.

2404
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:49,370
The Doyen can remove the bounty from any guild member.

2405
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:51,270
However, it takes money to bribe the guards.

2406
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:55,530
The guild member must pay the Doyen half of his total fines to get rid of them.

2407
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:57,210
Farewell.

2408
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:58,010
So, yeah.

2409
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,050
That guy can help me.

2410
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:00,610
Interesting.

2411
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:01,590
Interesting.

2412
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:05,170
Interesting.

2413
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:05,930
Interesting.

2414
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:10,050
Honestly, I only want to join it because of Gray Fox.

2415
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:17,530
Otherwise, I don't want to be a thief with morals.

2416
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,150
Who are you?

2417
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:22,830
I'm only asking for a single coin.

2418
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:27,090
I'm only asking for enough to feed me kids.

2419
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:28,450
Feed me kids.

2420
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,510
Have a coin.

2421
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:34,370
Now, tell me more.

2422
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:36,010
No, no, no.

2423
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:36,970
That's not what I want to hear.

2424
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:40,810
I'm bribing him.

2425
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:42,970
No, no, no, no.

2426
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:44,870
Here, I'll make him like me.

2427
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,490
Oh, see?

2428
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:46,430
He already likes me.

2429
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:46,990
Okay, here.

2430
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:47,330
Hold on.

2431
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:54,990
Okay.

2432
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:57,350
What nonsense?

2433
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:58,750
What nonsense?

2434
01:48:59,490 --> 01:48:59,590
What nonsense?

2435
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:00,930
I doubt it.

2436
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,610
Oh, that's...

2437
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:04,910
You win this one.

2438
01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:08,130
Um...

2439
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:09,230
I doubt it.

2440
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:10,110
Oh, shoot.

2441
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:11,830
What nonsense?

2442
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:13,330
That's enough.

2443
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:14,750
I like that.

2444
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:15,490
A lot.

2445
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:16,930
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

2446
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:19,070
What?

2447
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:19,530
That's it?

2448
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:20,430
I can't...

2449
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:22,930
Oh my gosh, he's expensive?

2450
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:26,490
24 gold for plus 11.

2451
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,550
That's craziness.

2452
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:31,110
That's so crazy.

2453
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:37,580
Okay.

2454
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,160
Excellent.

2455
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:40,880
I accept.

2456
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:42,520
Of course you do.

2457
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,420
I'm with you completely.

2458
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:45,900
Yeah.

2459
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,940
Are you looking for him?

2460
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,660
I want to rid the city of him.

2461
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,920
Yes, I want to work with him.

2462
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:59,440
I think I trust you enough to tell you this secret.

2463
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,380
Okay, yeah, tell me the secret.

2464
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:05,140
To learn more about the Gray Fox, go to the Garden of Daryloth at midnight.

2465
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:05,720
Oh.

2466
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,720
Look in the waterfront district of the Imperial City.

2467
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:10,780
I can say no more.

2468
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:11,820
I already knew that.

2469
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:14,680
I got the letter.

2470
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,600
I already knew that.

2471
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,620
Blessings of Mystara upon ye.

2472
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:22,060
Well...

2473
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:23,340
That's fine.

2474
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,200
That's fine.

2475
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,100
We didn't know.

2476
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:29,980
You...

2477
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,080
Oh.

2478
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:30,980
Wait.

2479
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:34,880
It's not illegal.

2480
01:50:40,190 --> 01:50:42,610
It just said that...

2481
01:50:42,610 --> 01:50:43,170
Wait.

2482
01:50:46,110 --> 01:50:46,810
Oh, shoot.

2483
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:52,610
Hold on.

2484
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:53,290
I got this.

2485
01:50:54,810 --> 01:50:55,810
Oh my goodness.

2486
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:56,930
I don't got this.

2487
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:03,270
I'm so bad at the game now.

2488
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:10,050
There we go.

2489
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:11,370
There we go.

2490
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:15,030
There we go.

2491
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:18,410
I'm really good at lick pock...

2492
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:19,250
Lick pocking.

2493
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:21,510
I mean...

2494
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:23,470
Block picking.

2495
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,960
Talk to people with your weapon out.

2496
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:03,740
Do the Riz minigame.

2497
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:05,580
Then lower your weapon for plus 10 bonus.

2498
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:05,840
Woo!

2499
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:08,460
When the beggar says blessings...

2500
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,860
Of Mystara as a reference to the classic...

2501
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,200
Dungeons and Dragons.

2502
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:12,580
Oh.

2503
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,020
Takesho, thanks for the...

2504
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,460
To give the...

2505
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:16,160
Groom and...

2506
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:16,940
Welcome to...

2507
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:17,840
Bubbleship.

2508
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:23,770
I'm so embarrassed.

2509
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:26,790
Anybody home?

2510
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:27,750
Oh, you're asleep.

2511
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:30,030
Wake up.

2512
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:33,630
Hello.

2513
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:35,430
No, no, no.

2514
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:35,950
Wake up.

2515
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:37,150
I'm talking to you.

2516
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:37,750
Wake up.

2517
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:41,170
I meant to say lock...

2518
01:52:41,170 --> 01:52:41,850
What can I do for you?

2519
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:42,590
Lock picking.

2520
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:48,390
It's good to know we've got such a strong fighters guild presence here in town.

2521
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:50,950
I'm sorry.

2522
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:53,430
I'm new in town and don't know anyone.

2523
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:54,150
Oh, you're new.

2524
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:55,950
That's cute.

2525
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:57,130
Good night.

2526
01:52:58,450 --> 01:53:00,550
Is all of your stuff in here for free?

2527
01:53:01,030 --> 01:53:01,470
Or...

2528
01:53:04,450 --> 01:53:05,930
Is it got no...

2529
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:09,630
Is it got no gold or...

2530
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:11,630
Nothing?

2531
01:53:13,290 --> 01:53:15,010
Just some linens?

2532
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:16,550
Okay.

2533
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:20,650
Empty urn.

2534
01:53:23,290 --> 01:53:24,050
Oh.

2535
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:27,950
Nah, I don't feel like you're doing it.

2536
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:30,150
There's probably nothing down there.

2537
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:32,810
Ooh, no reverse card.

2538
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:34,370
Good work.

2539
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:35,170
Lickpucker.

2540
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:35,510
No.

2541
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:41,590
Why does my brain do this to me?

2542
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:43,390
Why does my brain do this to me?

2543
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:46,750
Why won't they let me in the watchtower?

2544
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:47,690
Oh.

2545
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:51,410
This place looks like where a ghost would be at.

2546
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:53,190
Perhaps.

2547
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:56,690
A very spooky graveyard.

2548
01:53:57,150 --> 01:53:57,230
A very spooky graveyard.

2549
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:02,770
I'm surprised there's no like dev names on here.

2550
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:03,430
You know what I mean?

2551
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:04,930
Like on the gravestones.

2552
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:16,590
I think this is where I saw...

2553
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:16,690
Oh.

2554
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:17,710
What's going on here?

2555
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:22,810
How'd you do that without even pulling on it?

2556
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:23,230
Oh.

2557
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:24,290
He got into stance.

2558
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:25,510
Ready stance?

2559
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:27,630
Ready and...

2560
01:54:27,630 --> 01:54:28,630
Oh, there he goes!

2561
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:29,510
Not...

2562
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:29,570
Oh.

2563
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:30,770
Not very nice.

2564
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:32,130
Can you train me?

2565
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:32,310
How are you?

2566
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:33,950
Honda Todd is the name.

2567
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:34,570
Honda Todd!

2568
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:36,030
I'm a hunter and mountain man.

2569
01:54:36,230 --> 01:54:37,070
Can you train me?

2570
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:39,970
Not a nice place to visit.

2571
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:44,730
Those that remember still tell stories about the bad old days.

2572
01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:46,330
The bad old days.

2573
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:46,870
About 30 years back.

2574
01:54:46,990 --> 01:54:48,710
There was some trouble out there.

2575
01:54:49,230 --> 01:54:50,130
Bad trouble.

2576
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:52,010
Legion had to be called in.

2577
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:53,130
People killed.

2578
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:56,010
Why are we licking the king of Pocky?

2579
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:56,630
No!

2580
01:54:57,970 --> 01:54:59,430
Wait, you'll tell me more.

2581
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:02,310
Everybody's talking about the hero of Kvatch.

2582
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:06,430
They say she actually went into an oblivion gate and destroyed it.

2583
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:07,270
That's me!

2584
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:08,690
That's me.

2585
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:09,490
I did die.

2586
01:55:10,510 --> 01:55:11,070
We'll see.

2587
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:11,430
We'll see.

2588
01:55:11,710 --> 01:55:12,070
Wait.

2589
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:12,830
Okay.

2590
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:13,590
Hold on.

2591
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:17,350
I'll have my weapon out.

2592
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:18,130
I talk.

2593
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:19,770
Yes.

2594
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:22,210
Persuade.

2595
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:23,610
Oh, wait.

2596
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:25,650
It went down 10.

2597
01:55:25,650 --> 01:55:27,290
I don't think it's a 10 bonus.

2598
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:29,130
I think it's a 10...

2599
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:31,110
It already puts your...

2600
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:42,850
It gives you 10 debuffs.

2601
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:43,930
So...

2602
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,270
10 bonus?

2603
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:46,730
It does...

2604
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:47,670
It does...

2605
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:49,770
It then takes...

2606
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:51,710
It takes you down by then.

2607
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:53,830
Then you raise them up and you get plus 10.

2608
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:57,170
Yeah, but I can also just start with the plus 10 here.

2609
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:02,490
It goes back up so it's easier.

2610
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:04,210
Is it?

2611
01:56:04,210 --> 01:56:04,330
What?

2612
01:56:10,210 --> 01:56:11,810
Oh, it's because of the cap.

2613
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:13,910
Oh, I see.

2614
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:14,410
I see.

2615
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:15,910
Okay, okay, okay.

2616
01:56:17,230 --> 01:56:17,870
No, no, no.

2617
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:18,210
Don't leave.

2618
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:19,330
What can I do for you?

2619
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:20,410
I'm trying to raise you.

2620
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:22,410
The deer here are skittish.

2621
01:56:22,730 --> 01:56:25,770
Need to get them quick or they'll lead you a merry chase.

2622
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:28,110
Poison on your arrows can help.

2623
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:29,670
And it won't hurt the meat.

2624
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:30,130
Oh.

2625
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:31,790
Wait, wait, wait.

2626
01:56:31,890 --> 01:56:32,190
Hold on.

2627
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:34,190
Wait, maybe he can train me.

2628
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:35,150
There's much I can show you.

2629
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:36,630
He can train me.

2630
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:37,130
Wait.

2631
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:40,030
Wait, this is awesome.

2632
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:40,430
Hold on.

2633
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:42,050
Let's persuade him first.

2634
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:43,010
This better be good.

2635
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:48,650
Okay.

2636
01:56:51,730 --> 01:56:52,790
Oh, please.

2637
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:53,830
Oh, please.

2638
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:54,750
Oh, shoot.

2639
01:56:55,230 --> 01:56:56,330
Sure, that's cute.

2640
01:56:58,050 --> 01:56:59,350
Don't talk such rot.

2641
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:03,010
I did not do so good with that one.

2642
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:03,330
Amazing.

2643
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:04,110
But that's okay.

2644
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:05,970
All right.

2645
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:06,930
Not now.

2646
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:07,990
Not later.

2647
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:09,030
Not ever.

2648
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:09,730
Oh, damn.

2649
01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:11,290
Such adventure.

2650
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:12,610
That's just talk.

2651
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:13,610
Not bad.

2652
01:57:13,810 --> 01:57:14,730
Not bad at all.

2653
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,370
Nice.

2654
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:15,910
All right.

2655
01:57:16,030 --> 01:57:16,330
All right.

2656
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:17,410
Okay.

2657
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:17,650
Okay.

2658
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:18,230
Oh.

2659
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:18,750
Oh, shoot.

2660
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:19,510
This one's not great.

2661
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:22,530
Sure.

2662
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:23,310
That's cute.

2663
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:24,410
That's cute.

2664
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:28,150
What nonsense.

2665
01:57:28,570 --> 01:57:29,190
Oh, gosh.

2666
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:30,370
Such adventure.

2667
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:31,630
You can't scare me.

2668
01:57:31,690 --> 01:57:31,710
Oh, no.

2669
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:32,830
That one was so bad.

2670
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:35,130
Oh, that one was so bad.

2671
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:36,070
Oh, that one was so bad.

2672
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:36,690
Is that so?

2673
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:37,650
No.

2674
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:38,010
Not bad.

2675
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:39,190
Not bad at all.

2676
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:40,930
Uh, shoot.

2677
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:41,330
Shoot.

2678
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:41,570
Shoot.

2679
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:43,290
Don't waste your...

2680
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:46,030
My life is drab and wretched by comparison.

2681
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:47,010
Negative phrase.

2682
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:47,410
No.

2683
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:49,530
Don't talk such rot.

2684
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:51,350
Gracious.

2685
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:52,610
Oh, please.

2686
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:53,610
That's pretty good.

2687
01:57:53,870 --> 01:57:56,210
My speech craft skill has increased.

2688
01:57:56,910 --> 01:57:57,730
Let's go.

2689
01:57:57,730 --> 01:57:57,970
Oh.

2690
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:00,290
Not now.

2691
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:01,090
This is the...

2692
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:01,390
Not later.

2693
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:02,450
Not ever.

2694
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:03,290
Oh, no.

2695
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:04,570
Um.

2696
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:06,970
That's pretty good.

2697
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:09,470
Wait.

2698
01:58:09,890 --> 01:58:10,010
Uh.

2699
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:11,390
That's amazing.

2700
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:13,030
That's just talk.

2701
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:13,470
No.

2702
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:14,710
Oh, I messed it up.

2703
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:16,070
That's just talk.

2704
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:17,150
Sure.

2705
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:17,790
That's cute.

2706
01:58:18,710 --> 01:58:19,050
Wait.

2707
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:19,830
Uh.

2708
01:58:20,350 --> 01:58:20,930
It's okay.

2709
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:21,030
Okay.

2710
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:21,210
Now.

2711
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:21,510
Actually.

2712
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:21,910
Actually...

2713
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:22,950
My life is drab.

2714
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:24,330
And wretched by comparison.

2715
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:25,870
Be seeing you.

2716
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:28,370
Okay, now if I put my...

2717
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:30,030
Weapon away...

2718
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:30,550
Wait, wait, wait.

2719
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:30,930
Wait, wait, wait.

2720
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,670
Come here, come here.

2721
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:34,830
Tell me about Hector's...

2722
01:58:34,830 --> 01:58:37,350
Some say the Legion burned the town to the ground.

2723
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:41,130
But it's still there for those that go looking for trouble.

2724
01:58:41,570 --> 01:58:43,150
Still folks living up there.

2725
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:46,090
But no one you'd like to meet open夜.

2726
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:46,990
That's right!

2727
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:49,190
It was that super saucy town, no!

2728
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:51,390
Okay, let's also train with this guy.

2729
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:55,850
Wait, oh my gosh.

2730
01:58:56,890 --> 01:58:58,450
Is training worth it?

2731
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:00,070
I feel like it is, though.

2732
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:02,390
This guy has his athletics.

2733
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:06,710
We even leveled up.

2734
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:10,690
I mean, they're so good at Rizzing.

2735
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:14,050
Yeah, yeah, it's free leveled up.

2736
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:14,750
Well, free.

2737
01:59:20,430 --> 01:59:21,190
Oh!

2738
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:27,680
Training is faster, but more expensive.

2739
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:28,940
Not athletics.

2740
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:32,920
I'm faster!

2741
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:34,400
I'm faster!

2742
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:35,720
Can you get me?

2743
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:38,180
Wait, can I take this?

2744
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:40,040
Oh, I can!

2745
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:44,260
My arrow's now.

2746
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,280
My arrow's now.

2747
01:59:54,050 --> 01:59:55,130
Try again.

2748
01:59:58,130 --> 01:59:58,890
Yoink.

2749
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:02,850
I'm Lumgro Barath.

2750
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,110
The cheerful one.

2751
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:07,130
My brother Kurz is not so cheerful.

2752
02:00:09,230 --> 02:00:10,890
I'm the cheerful one.

2753
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:12,690
Block.

2754
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:13,850
Oh, wow.

2755
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:14,390
Interesting.

2756
02:00:14,850 --> 02:00:15,570
That's kind of fun.

2757
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:20,130
Dogs are an orc's best friend.

2758
02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:21,290
Good protection.

2759
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,510
Good companion.

2760
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:23,870
Good eats.

2761
02:00:24,230 --> 02:00:25,970
The Briants have dogs.

2762
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:27,030
Lots of them.

2763
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:30,330
She's taking their dogs and eating them?

2764
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:37,350
Hey, you're the one they call the Hero of Kvatch, aren't you?

2765
02:00:37,470 --> 02:00:38,050
Yeah, that's me.

2766
02:00:38,050 --> 02:00:40,070
The one that closed the Oblivion Gate and saved the city.

2767
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:45,870
The well in Hector has low enough roof that you can power trend acrobatics there by spam jumping.

2768
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:46,770
No kidding?

2769
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:49,350
Also helps restoration through recovery fatigue.

2770
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:50,210
Oh, damn.

2771
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:51,310
Goodbye.

2772
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:51,950
Goodbye.

2773
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:54,850
Goodbye.

2774
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:54,930
Okay.

2775
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:57,790
Did I... I think I came in through here.

2776
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:00,930
So...

2777
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:01,470
Let's hear it.

2778
02:01:01,710 --> 02:01:02,590
Oh, no.

2779
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:02,970
Sorry.

2780
02:01:03,090 --> 02:01:04,150
I accidentally ran into you.

2781
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:05,690
Uh...

2782
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:08,850
What we can do is I still want to talk to that ghost.

2783
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:09,910
You know, I haven't forgotten.

2784
02:01:10,150 --> 02:01:11,090
Oh, the Mage's Guild.

2785
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:12,130
I'm a part of that.

2786
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:13,650
Fighter's Guild.

2787
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:19,160
That person's house.

2788
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,640
I still want to see the ghost.

2789
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:29,570
Uh...

2790
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:29,970
Hello?

2791
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:31,390
Hello?

2792
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:33,110
Who's here?

2793
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:33,590
Whoa!

2794
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:38,150
I think I just walked in upon royalty.

2795
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:41,830
Oh, my gosh.

2796
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:43,510
They're so...

2797
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:45,110
Wow, this place is so fancy.

2798
02:01:47,850 --> 02:01:48,330
Oh.

2799
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:49,130
Hello.

2800
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:50,370
Good work.

2801
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:51,130
Good pay.

2802
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:52,410
Want to join the guild?

2803
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:53,010
Oh.

2804
02:01:53,290 --> 02:01:53,770
What's...

2805
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:55,030
Oh, it's the Fighter's Guild.

2806
02:01:55,570 --> 02:01:55,810
No.

2807
02:01:56,090 --> 02:01:56,430
Farewell.

2808
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:02,920
Wait!

2809
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:03,560
I can...

2810
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:04,520
I can level up.

2811
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:06,540
Okay, I'll join the Fighter's Guild.

2812
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,620
Actually, I'll just go sleep at the Mage's Guild.

2813
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:10,660
Actually, I'll join the Fighter's Guild.

2814
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:11,340
Work, good.

2815
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:14,100
If you're looking to join up, you should...

2816
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:15,580
Uh-oh.

2817
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:16,800
Join the guild.

2818
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,320
You won't regret it.

2819
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:19,940
Ugh, too much work.

2820
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:21,540
Ha ha ha ha.

2821
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,140
Too much work.

2822
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:26,060
I'll join it eventually.

2823
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,360
We'll join everything.

2824
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:29,060
But we gotta go level up.

2825
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,480
How can I help you?

2826
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,540
Been to Fire and Steel recently?

2827
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,780
Rashida has some nice new swords in there.

2828
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:36,640
Good.

2829
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:38,820
And she's a friendly one, she is.

2830
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:43,700
Rashida does a good job keeping fire and steel stocked with good weapons.

2831
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:46,980
Maybe not the best in Tamriel, but good.

2832
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,180
Take care.

2833
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:49,280
How goes it?

2834
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,520
Fire and steel, huh?

2835
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:52,400
Anytime now.

2836
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:53,000
Where's that?

2837
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:53,800
What's going on?

2838
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:54,140
We're here.

2839
02:02:58,140 --> 02:02:59,420
My acrobatics?

2840
02:02:59,620 --> 02:02:59,960
Let's go.

2841
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:01,820
Ha ha ha.

2842
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:03,120
Pretty elf.

2843
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:03,620
Oh, hello.

2844
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:04,800
Rashida?

2845
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:05,640
Hello.

2846
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,020
I'm Rashida, the smith.

2847
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:10,480
And this is Fire and Steel.

2848
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:13,140
Quality armor and weapons.

2849
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:14,260
Repairs, too.

2850
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:15,940
What can I do for you?

2851
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:16,500
Nice.

2852
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,800
Flint and steel.

2853
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:20,800
Wait, what can you train here?

2854
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:22,220
Let's see if we can't teach you a thing or two.

2855
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:23,740
Armorer.

2856
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:26,300
Can I interest you in some of my wares?

2857
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:28,660
Way to find Iron Bow.

2858
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:31,500
I have a steel bow.

2859
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,700
Oh, it's about the same, huh?

2860
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:36,200
It actually weighs less, though.

2861
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:39,500
The steel bow is heavier.

2862
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,920
But a fine Iron Bow.

2863
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:43,560
Hmm.

2864
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:44,960
Hmm.

2865
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,080
Curious.

2866
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:48,520
Hmm.

2867
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:51,840
I double take every time I see ET.

2868
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:54,600
Hmm.

2869
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:56,970
Hmm.

2870
02:04:00,870 --> 02:04:01,710
Hmm.

2871
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:02,350
White bow, actually.

2872
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:02,970
Oh, my gosh.

2873
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:04,870
White bow is about to break.

2874
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:06,510
Oh, I just noticed.

2875
02:04:06,930 --> 02:04:08,070
That would be terrifying.

2876
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:10,630
Yeah, time to risk her up.

2877
02:04:11,910 --> 02:04:12,390
I'm listening.

2878
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:22,670
You're full of it.

2879
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:24,370
She likes this.

2880
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:25,890
Don't, please.

2881
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:26,710
I'm sorry.

2882
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:29,170
I'm not buying that one.

2883
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:31,250
Not bad.

2884
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:32,590
Not bad at all.

2885
02:04:32,830 --> 02:04:33,710
Not bad at all.

2886
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:35,530
Okay, here we go.

2887
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:37,430
Try again.

2888
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:37,810
Uh.

2889
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:38,710
No more.

2890
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:39,930
You're frightening me.

2891
02:04:41,190 --> 02:04:43,310
I doubt you really mean that.

2892
02:04:43,630 --> 02:04:44,230
Yeah.

2893
02:04:44,690 --> 02:04:46,550
I get blah, blah, blah.

2894
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:47,590
What a bore.

2895
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:49,110
You're frightening me.

2896
02:04:51,490 --> 02:04:54,350
You're a big, fat liar.

2897
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:54,990
What?

2898
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:56,210
I accept.

2899
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:57,550
I have no choice.

2900
02:04:57,910 --> 02:04:58,890
That's pretty good.

2901
02:04:59,310 --> 02:04:59,750
Oh, shoot.

2902
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:01,410
Was that supposed to be a compliment?

2903
02:05:01,950 --> 02:05:02,370
Oh, no.

2904
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:04,890
Uh.

2905
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:06,790
Oh.

2906
02:05:07,550 --> 02:05:08,730
Was that supposed to be...

2907
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:09,410
I accept.

2908
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:10,450
I have no choice.

2909
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:11,130
Good one.

2910
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:12,510
Don't make me laugh.

2911
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:13,890
Okay, we made it to 70.

2912
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:15,730
We made it to 70.

2913
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:16,630
We made it to 70.

2914
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:17,110
Let's see.

2915
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:17,630
Bartering.

2916
02:05:17,830 --> 02:05:20,270
May I interest you in some of my fine wares?

2917
02:05:20,370 --> 02:05:21,310
Yeah, let's haggle.

2918
02:05:23,410 --> 02:05:24,890
What if I bought...

2919
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:32,330
What if I buy your items at 175% of their value?

2920
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:37,370
Try and go...

2921
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:38,470
Try to go...

2922
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:38,570
Wait.

2923
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:40,850
Convince people that it's a good idea to make...

2924
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:41,230
No.

2925
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:41,930
Don't do that.

2926
02:05:42,010 --> 02:05:42,870
Don't make...

2927
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:43,490
Don't.

2928
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:44,210
Don't.

2929
02:05:44,390 --> 02:05:44,830
No.

2930
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:45,670
No.

2931
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:51,810
She's an expert merchant.

2932
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:53,370
She's gonna kick your wallet's butt.

2933
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:53,910
Oh.

2934
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:54,930
Oh, because this.

2935
02:05:55,550 --> 02:05:56,670
So am I.

2936
02:05:58,290 --> 02:06:00,410
I can't make that deal.

2937
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:01,070
No.

2938
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:02,250
Um.

2939
02:06:02,810 --> 02:06:05,090
How about at 41%?

2940
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:11,450
Oh, wait.

2941
02:06:11,450 --> 02:06:13,690
Well, that's how much I would sell stuff at.

2942
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:14,710
But it...

2943
02:06:14,710 --> 02:06:15,930
It still worked.

2944
02:06:17,810 --> 02:06:19,550
And we can sell the pearl.

2945
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:23,390
Wait.

2946
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:24,850
Where are the other things that I stole?

2947
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:28,150
I stole those gems?

2948
02:06:28,830 --> 02:06:29,390
Wait.

2949
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:30,110
It's all gone.

2950
02:06:32,470 --> 02:06:34,830
I stole those gems from...

2951
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:36,310
From the temple.

2952
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:39,670
Oh, I can't sell stolen stuff.

2953
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:40,690
Oh, that's right.

2954
02:06:40,710 --> 02:06:41,990
Tell your friends about me.

2955
02:06:42,290 --> 02:06:42,550
Okay.

2956
02:06:43,210 --> 02:06:43,770
Oh, wait.

2957
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:44,490
Maybe I can repair...

2958
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:46,090
I can repair almost anything.

2959
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:48,790
For 20 gold?

2960
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:49,150
Yeah.

2961
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:51,630
That's pretty cheap.

2962
02:06:54,570 --> 02:06:55,170
Okay.

2963
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:56,390
I think we're good.

2964
02:06:58,530 --> 02:06:59,390
You too.

2965
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:00,530
Thanks.

2966
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:05,670
Okay, nice.

2967
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:13,040
I wanna use my repair hammers in case I'm out and about.

2968
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,760
Like if I'm in a dungeon or something and need it.

2969
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:16,520
Ooh.

2970
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:17,800
What's going on?

2971
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:19,060
Okay.

2972
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:20,120
We're all good.

2973
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:22,200
Let's go sleep at the...

2974
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:23,340
Mage's Guild?

2975
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:25,900
And we'll sleep until like...

2976
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:26,960
What time does it get now?

2977
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:29,180
It becomes nine.

2978
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:30,020
I wonder.

2979
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:34,780
What is it?

2980
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:35,040
Hi there.

2981
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:37,840
Do you ever spend time in the Oaken Krozier?

2982
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:40,420
I've had many meals at the Oaken Krozier.

2983
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:41,260
Everybody's talking.

2984
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:43,300
It may not be the best in Osiradu.

2985
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:44,900
But it suits me fine.

2986
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:46,040
He acted like he didn't.

2987
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:47,840
The bulls.

2988
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:49,560
Everybody's talking.

2989
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:50,660
Eight...

2990
02:07:50,660 --> 02:07:51,000
Oh, wait.

2991
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:51,580
Eight p.m.

2992
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:52,080
is night time.

2993
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:52,540
Okay, okay.

2994
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:53,840
Let's sleep.

2995
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,440
Where's your bed?

2996
02:07:55,940 --> 02:07:57,580
Where's the bed for guild members?

2997
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:02,040
Where's your bed for guild members?

2998
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,220
Which is I.

2999
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:04,380
I am a guild member.

3000
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:05,420
Living quarters.

3001
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:06,960
It's my birthday!

3002
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,440
Do you think I could get a short song?

3003
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:13,600
I missed my chance last year since I didn't know birthday songs were a deal back then.

3004
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:15,400
And I decided to wait like a good wisp.

3005
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:16,860
Aw, Fixie!

3006
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,060
Yeah, give me a second.

3007
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:24,020
Let me find a bed first.

3008
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:26,560
Oh!

3009
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,660
I found a bed.

3010
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:31,800
Happy birthday to you.

3011
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:34,040
Happy birthday to you.

3012
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:36,720
Happy birthday, Fixie the Reaper.

3013
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:40,180
Happy birthday to you.

3014
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:44,000
Ooh, happy birthday!

3015
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:50,720
It's been a minute since I've done it.

3016
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:57,570
Okay, sleep.

3017
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:03,650
It's 12 PM, we'll wait for seven hours.

3018
02:09:06,350 --> 02:09:09,890
Four, three, two, one.

3019
02:09:11,530 --> 02:09:14,570
And we've ascended to level six.

3020
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:16,190
Let's go.

3021
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:18,310
All in on agility.

3022
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,030
We'll do...

3023
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:27,730
A little more strength.

3024
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:32,690
Was it endurance that I was doing?

3025
02:09:33,410 --> 02:09:34,390
And endurance.

3026
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:37,490
I think that's been kind of what I've...

3027
02:09:37,490 --> 02:09:39,010
what I've been...

3028
02:09:39,890 --> 02:09:41,350
allocating my stuff to.

3029
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:44,190
Do you like...

3030
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:46,070
Skooma?

3031
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:49,150
What's that?

3032
02:09:51,210 --> 02:09:53,870
Somebody can't set an alarm like you're Nancy Drew.

3033
02:09:54,110 --> 02:09:55,810
We can always make our own.

3034
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:57,150
When we wake up...

3035
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:58,950
Okay, once I click confirm.

3036
02:10:02,070 --> 02:10:03,030
Okay.

3037
02:10:06,810 --> 02:10:08,030
What's in here?

3038
02:10:19,950 --> 02:10:20,870
What's in here?

3039
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:22,410
Why is it...

3040
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:24,290
on oblivion?

3041
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:24,770
Oh.

3042
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:33,620
Nice.

3043
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:34,440
What's this...

3044
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,160
Skooma nuts.

3045
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:38,960
Wait, why is this door...

3046
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,280
not allowed?

3047
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:42,240
Where does it go to?

3048
02:10:42,980 --> 02:10:44,220
How curious.

3049
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:47,340
How curious indeed.

3050
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:48,760
How do I get out of here?

3051
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,400
I'm lost.

3052
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:51,640
Um...

3053
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:52,940
I want to go back downstairs.

3054
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,440
I want to go back downstairs.

3055
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:55,020
I'm lost.

3056
02:10:57,420 --> 02:10:57,840
Um...

3057
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:59,340
The library?

3058
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:02,620
Some books give you stats.

3059
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,360
Yeah, I've been...

3060
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:04,660
Oh.

3061
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:05,900
Oh.

3062
02:11:06,620 --> 02:11:08,620
I think...

3063
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:13,840
Let me out of here.

3064
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,160
I want to go see the ghost.

3065
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:19,260
Oh my gosh.

3066
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:21,820
This is such a cute little sitting area.

3067
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:24,300
Wait.

3068
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,500
You don't need to read them.

3069
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:28,260
Just open them.

3070
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:30,320
So if I read them...

3071
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,860
Or if I open the book on oblivion.

3072
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,180
I want to read it though too.

3073
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:38,360
Assassination.

3074
02:11:43,230 --> 02:11:43,630
Emperor...

3075
02:11:43,630 --> 02:11:43,870
Whoa.

3076
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:46,130
The emperor was assassinated.

3077
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:47,190
Dang.

3078
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:48,690
One day I'll be in one of these.

3079
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:56,730
The origin of the mages killed.

3080
02:11:57,170 --> 02:11:57,410
Yeah.

3081
02:11:57,490 --> 02:11:58,550
I'm sure they got like...

3082
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:58,730
Whoa.

3083
02:12:00,370 --> 02:12:03,050
They have the whole series of the real barons Aya.

3084
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:07,530
This passage has been censored by...

3085
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:08,830
Order of the temple.

3086
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:18,610
He hissed angrily.

3087
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:23,970
M'lady.

3088
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:25,290
Stop calling me that.

3089
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:29,270
Too spicy.

3090
02:12:29,730 --> 02:12:29,850
Wait.

3091
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:31,470
Volume 5 is down there.

3092
02:12:31,630 --> 02:12:31,810
Why?

3093
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:34,350
Look at all these books too.

3094
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:36,570
Wait.

3095
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:37,130
What time is it?

3096
02:12:37,930 --> 02:12:38,870
It's almost 8.

3097
02:12:39,230 --> 02:12:41,750
I need to figure out how to get out of here.

3098
02:12:43,650 --> 02:12:45,490
How do I leave this place?

3099
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:47,370
Is it this door?

3100
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:48,950
Where?

3101
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:50,270
How did I come up here?

3102
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:51,950
How do I get out of here?

3103
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:56,520
Go to...

3104
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:57,480
Bravo...

3105
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:57,800
Wait.

3106
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:58,340
Hold on.

3107
02:13:03,190 --> 02:13:04,490
Cut through the library.

3108
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:06,070
Oh wait.

3109
02:13:06,130 --> 02:13:06,550
It's over here.

3110
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:08,770
Get me out of here.

3111
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:14,400
I don't think there was a...

3112
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:15,040
Wait.

3113
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:16,740
Oh my gosh.

3114
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:18,320
I just didn't see this door.

3115
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:22,340
Okay.

3116
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:23,600
Wait.

3117
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:24,700
Uh...

3118
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:25,160
Hail.

3119
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:26,580
Goodbye.

3120
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:28,240
How goes it?

3121
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:28,500
Nope.

3122
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:29,540
Don't talk to me.

3123
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,600
Come to Braville.

3124
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:37,800
Censored Passage was in a previous sus game and involved a spiky cat man...

3125
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:38,680
...member?

3126
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:44,680
Wait.

3127
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:45,560
Is this the right one?

3128
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:46,780
Let's hope.

3129
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,580
It's that explicit.

3130
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:55,390
Oh, we're in the right spot.

3131
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:56,010
Good job, horse.

3132
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:57,230
Okay.

3133
02:13:58,130 --> 02:14:00,130
We're looking for a ghost now, everybody.

3134
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:03,530
We're looking for...

3135
02:14:03,530 --> 02:14:05,270
...a ghost on these roads.

3136
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:10,230
We're looking for a ghost on these roads.

3137
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:13,310
A ghost!

3138
02:14:14,070 --> 02:14:15,870
I'm also a ghost.

3139
02:14:16,730 --> 02:14:17,770
No, not me!

3140
02:14:19,390 --> 02:14:20,550
Not me.

3141
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:22,330
Another ghost.

3142
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:25,650
They just left this guy.

3143
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:34,970
Where can I see him?

3144
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:37,710
Ghost!

3145
02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:39,710
Ghost!

3146
02:14:41,030 --> 02:14:41,730
Ghost!

3147
02:14:43,690 --> 02:14:44,390
Ghost!

3148
02:14:45,330 --> 02:14:46,730
Ghost!

3149
02:14:49,570 --> 02:14:52,010
Ghost in the bottom right.

3150
02:14:52,510 --> 02:14:52,670
No!

3151
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:55,750
Ghost!

3152
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:03,970
Ghost!

3153
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:07,310
Ghost!

3154
02:15:10,150 --> 02:15:12,130
If you guys see it, yell ghost.

3155
02:15:13,570 --> 02:15:14,850
I think that was my horse.

3156
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:20,790
If you guys see it, ghost, yell ghost!

3157
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:26,660
Follow the red marker.

3158
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:27,540
It's not!

3159
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,400
It's not that, you guys!

3160
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:30,780
It's not the red marker!

3161
02:15:35,350 --> 02:15:35,850
Ghost!

3162
02:15:35,850 --> 02:15:36,130
Ghost!

3163
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:38,810
Wait, where do you see it?

3164
02:15:39,190 --> 02:15:40,970
Wait, where do you see it, actually?

3165
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:44,050
The ghost is scared of ghosts.

3166
02:15:44,410 --> 02:15:45,350
It's on the bottom right.

3167
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:45,750
No!

3168
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:49,630
Not me!

3169
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:51,430
Not me!

3170
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:55,650
I want to see the ghost in the game!

3171
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:06,040
He said that there was one, and then people said that this ghost was real.

3172
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:09,760
The ghost on the path.

3173
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:17,080
You need to specify non-made ghost.

3174
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,040
I don't know if he's a made ghost or not.

3175
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:24,860
I don't think the ghost is an active quest.

3176
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,040
Or rather...

3177
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:33,660
I don't think it was a quest.

3178
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:37,880
There was just a guy that said that there was a ghost.

3179
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:39,500
On this road.

3180
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:43,560
He travels along the path, so he is easy to miss.

3181
02:16:49,770 --> 02:16:53,290
It's close to roads leading to Koro, not around the town.

3182
02:16:54,210 --> 02:16:55,990
So not this road?

3183
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,090
Let's see.

3184
02:17:05,090 --> 02:17:07,990
So he's on the paths leading to Koro.

3185
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:21,520
It's not a quest.

3186
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:23,940
I think it's more like a random encounter, yeah.

3187
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,040
That's not a ghost.

3188
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:54,920
Time to make a Minto mod for Oblivion.

3189
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:03,630
Oh no, this is the Wayne and Pry-

3190
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:10,010
Are those the guys that want me to join their little...

3191
02:18:10,010 --> 02:18:10,850
Their thing?

3192
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:12,910
The farmer boys?

3193
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:18,580
Priory.

3194
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:21,160
Wayne and Priory.

3195
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:31,030
I feel like I'll never see him.

3196
02:18:35,450 --> 02:18:37,570
I feel like I'll never see the ghost.

3197
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:48,330
Should be around under Paul Cave.

3198
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:51,910
Wonderful.

3199
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:56,130
A crumbling mine?

3200
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:03,190
North East.

3201
02:19:05,310 --> 02:19:06,230
Oh, wait.

3202
02:19:06,470 --> 02:19:07,650
Is that not where I am?

3203
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:11,090
He isn't near the town.

3204
02:19:12,690 --> 02:19:14,170
Travel the orange road.

3205
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:14,470
Okay.

3206
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:28,640
I guess we didn't travel this road.

3207
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:33,120
Before we were like...

3208
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,590
At night, so...

3209
02:19:37,030 --> 02:19:38,240
North East.

3210
02:19:42,310 --> 02:19:43,630
North East.

3211
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:45,550
Come on.

3212
02:19:49,330 --> 02:19:52,130
My head in Shadow's Rest Cavern.

3213
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:57,270
Oh my god.

3214
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:00,750
Leave me alone.

3215
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:02,830
Oh...

3216
02:20:02,830 --> 02:20:03,210
Gosh.

3217
02:20:06,510 --> 02:20:07,790
Don't attack my horse.

3218
02:20:08,210 --> 02:20:09,010
Oh my god.

3219
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:10,010
You're pathetic.

3220
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:11,770
It's a horse!

3221
02:20:13,250 --> 02:20:14,330
It's a horse.

3222
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:15,310
It's a horse.

3223
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:15,950
It's a horse.

3224
02:20:16,770 --> 02:20:17,610
Oh my god.

3225
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:17,830
No!

3226
02:20:17,990 --> 02:20:18,690
I got my horse!

3227
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:24,840
Stop it!

3228
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:26,120
Oh my gosh.

3229
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:27,800
My horse is also attacking him.

3230
02:20:36,430 --> 02:20:38,350
Take all my arrows back.

3231
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:39,390
That guy was tough.

3232
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:42,310
You were a tough bandit.

3233
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:43,470
There he goes.

3234
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:44,630
Sinking down the hill.

3235
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:46,690
How come more important things...

3236
02:20:46,690 --> 02:20:46,790
Oh.

3237
02:20:47,010 --> 02:20:47,730
Oh, there he is.

3238
02:20:49,650 --> 02:20:50,930
How far can he go?

3239
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:57,510
You start the Knights of the Nine questline, you'll eventually meet the ghost.

3240
02:20:58,590 --> 02:20:59,070
Really?

3241
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:18,610
Reading the ghost is on the road that leads to Bruma from Coral.

3242
02:21:21,350 --> 02:21:22,750
That would be this road.

3243
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:23,630
The orange road.

3244
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:27,970
Maybe the ghost will run past us because we're...

3245
02:21:27,970 --> 02:21:28,710
Wait, what time is it?

3246
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:30,850
Oh.

3247
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:32,110
Enemies are nearby.

3248
02:21:32,850 --> 02:21:33,530
Well, he's dead.

3249
02:21:35,430 --> 02:21:37,030
He's a dead enemy.

3250
02:21:37,830 --> 02:21:39,230
How does that help me?

3251
02:21:40,090 --> 02:21:42,940
Maybe the ants are taking him.

3252
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:46,930
I want to see how far he goes.

3253
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:50,910
Maybe the ghost will run past us because we're...

3254
02:21:50,910 --> 02:21:52,130
Oh, my horse.

3255
02:21:52,950 --> 02:21:54,110
Oh, my horse.

3256
02:21:54,130 --> 02:21:55,110
I'm so sorry.

3257
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:56,150
I didn't mean to.

3258
02:21:57,250 --> 02:21:57,850
Oh.

3259
02:21:58,410 --> 02:21:59,410
He's better now.

3260
02:22:04,330 --> 02:22:06,350
Have you seen the ghost?

3261
02:22:08,010 --> 02:22:08,610
Oh.

3262
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:11,010
He's ignoring me.

3263
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:12,410
What is it, citizen?

3264
02:22:13,090 --> 02:22:14,090
Have you...

3265
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:15,630
Have you seen the ghost?

3266
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:17,350
Talk to me.

3267
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:19,330
Oh, wow.

3268
02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:20,030
What an angle.

3269
02:22:23,050 --> 02:22:25,030
I don't know who was behind the Emperor's murder.

3270
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:28,070
We've already ruled out the Dark Brotherhood.

3271
02:22:28,730 --> 02:22:30,050
So is this something...

3272
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:31,370
Worse?

3273
02:22:31,570 --> 02:22:33,130
I'm gonna be a part of that soon.

3274
02:22:33,770 --> 02:22:34,650
Carry on.

3275
02:22:34,930 --> 02:22:35,250
Okay.

3276
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:38,530
I'm looking for a ghost.

3277
02:22:40,810 --> 02:22:44,970
This guy is still slowly but surely sinking down the hill.

3278
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:50,850
All this just for one ghost.

3279
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:57,210
Excited to get to Duke but now realizing they're going to be shooting.

3280
02:22:58,610 --> 02:22:58,730
Oh.

3281
02:22:59,590 --> 02:23:00,370
Wait, what?

3282
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:05,720
Brandon, I hope everything's okay.

3283
02:23:07,780 --> 02:23:08,280
Wait.

3284
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:09,200
Wait.

3285
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:10,040
Is it here?

3286
02:23:14,860 --> 02:23:15,580
Wait, no.

3287
02:23:15,660 --> 02:23:16,520
Is this the cavern?

3288
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:18,080
Wait, something...

3289
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:19,320
Oh, we went up that...

3290
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:22,020
We went over this earlier before, no?

3291
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,920
Calm down, bro.

3292
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:31,330
Alright.

3293
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:35,450
I say...

3294
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:39,350
Well, it's only 1am.

3295
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:41,290
We might still catch him, no?

3296
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:41,610
Oh.

3297
02:23:43,810 --> 02:23:44,850
Oh, ghost.

3298
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:46,630
Oh, ghost.

3299
02:23:54,910 --> 02:23:56,010
What are we doing now?

3300
02:23:56,210 --> 02:23:57,030
Looking for a ghost.

3301
02:23:58,430 --> 02:23:59,890
But I think I'm actually...

3302
02:23:59,890 --> 02:24:00,050
Wait.

3303
02:24:00,050 --> 02:24:00,090
Wait.

3304
02:24:00,670 --> 02:24:02,250
Oh, it's 1am.

3305
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:05,030
We have to wait until midnight...

3306
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:07,150
For the...

3307
02:24:07,150 --> 02:24:08,110
Thieves Guild.

3308
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:14,200
Where's the cave at?

3309
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:16,020
Glad...

3310
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,320
Gladymist Cave.

3311
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:21,480
Hmm...

3312
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:21,900
Hmm...

3313
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:22,600
Yeah...

3314
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:26,910
Oh, that's right.

3315
02:24:26,930 --> 02:24:28,190
It was, uh...

3316
02:24:28,190 --> 02:24:28,970
Oh, that's a dog.

3317
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:29,690
No.

3318
02:24:29,930 --> 02:24:30,130
No!

3319
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:34,910
I was hoping he wouldn't see me.

3320
02:24:38,310 --> 02:24:39,350
Just keep running.

3321
02:24:41,570 --> 02:24:43,830
What if I fast travel away?

3322
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:45,930
Will the dog also fast travel?

3323
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:47,630
Actually...

3324
02:24:47,630 --> 02:24:47,910
Wait.

3325
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:49,510
Can I get to...

3326
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:50,570
Oh, gosh.

3327
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:51,190
Okay, horse.

3328
02:24:51,470 --> 02:24:52,430
We're going to...

3329
02:24:52,430 --> 02:24:53,010
Okay, horse.

3330
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:53,750
Horse.

3331
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:54,870
Horse.

3332
02:24:58,110 --> 02:24:59,230
Alright, let's go, horse.

3333
02:24:59,530 --> 02:25:00,050
Let's go.

3334
02:25:00,570 --> 02:25:01,410
Good job, horse.

3335
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:06,390
We're going to the Imperial City.

3336
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:07,270
I give up.

3337
02:25:12,150 --> 02:25:13,270
I think the...

3338
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:14,370
I think we lost the dog.

3339
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:18,410
Awesome.

3340
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:20,010
Oh, good job, horse.

3341
02:25:20,370 --> 02:25:21,310
Oh, that's an imp.

3342
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:22,090
Ignore?

3343
02:25:25,470 --> 02:25:26,590
Ignore and go downwards?

3344
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:32,770
Oh, gosh.

3345
02:25:33,450 --> 02:25:34,730
Why is the music getting worse?

3346
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:36,090
Keep going.

3347
02:25:37,770 --> 02:25:38,670
Where are we?

3348
02:25:39,570 --> 02:25:40,430
Guys, I'm lost.

3349
02:25:42,010 --> 02:25:42,970
There's a deer.

3350
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:44,250
Excuse me.

3351
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:47,710
And...

3352
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:49,350
A path has been found.

3353
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:50,590
I think.

3354
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:53,930
Is that dog still chasing after me?

3355
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:55,810
I wonder where he's at.

3356
02:25:58,210 --> 02:25:59,170
Oh, God!

3357
02:25:59,170 --> 02:25:59,910
He's right there!

3358
02:26:00,130 --> 02:26:01,090
He's on my tail!

3359
02:26:03,470 --> 02:26:04,670
Oh, my God!

3360
02:26:05,150 --> 02:26:06,370
He's persistent.

3361
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:13,950
Why can't you outrun fellas in this game?

3362
02:26:15,890 --> 02:26:17,370
Oh, my gosh.

3363
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:21,370
Surely we'll run into a member of the Imperial...

3364
02:26:21,970 --> 02:26:22,630
Everything.

3365
02:26:24,210 --> 02:26:24,950
That's a bandit.

3366
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:26,070
No?

3367
02:26:26,310 --> 02:26:27,030
That's a person.

3368
02:26:28,050 --> 02:26:28,770
That's a bandit!

3369
02:26:29,050 --> 02:26:29,250
Run!

3370
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:35,220
Help!

3371
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:36,480
Help!

3372
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:37,740
Help!

3373
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,200
Help!

3374
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:41,180
Help!

3375
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:43,140
Help!

3376
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:48,720
Okay, he's gonna get the dog.

3377
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:52,800
Nice.

3378
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:57,060
I win by doing nothing.

3379
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:00,960
Wait, why did that guy stop chasing me?

3380
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:06,320
GG easy.

3381
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:11,120
Are you a friend or what?

3382
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:13,100
He's not a bandit.

3383
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:13,800
Who are you?

3384
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:18,480
Oh, I almost killed you!

3385
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:21,220
Who are you?

3386
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:25,520
Yeah,

3387
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,320
I mean...

3388
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:32,340
Be seeing you.

3389
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,500
Just a guy.

3390
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:38,320
Anyway...

3391
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:39,260
Very nice.

3392
02:27:47,650 --> 02:27:48,950
Where are we?

3393
02:27:49,810 --> 02:27:50,770
Oh, okay.

3394
02:27:50,930 --> 02:27:52,050
We're right outside the city.

3395
02:27:52,850 --> 02:27:53,430
Perfect.

3396
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:55,970
Perfect.

3397
02:27:56,970 --> 02:27:58,050
Let's go this way.

3398
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:01,350
Why?

3399
02:28:03,610 --> 02:28:04,690
Why is he...

3400
02:28:04,690 --> 02:28:06,110
What is that guy doing outside?

3401
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:06,910
Wandering?

3402
02:28:07,490 --> 02:28:08,530
There are bandits around here.

3403
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:09,130
Run!

3404
02:28:09,710 --> 02:28:09,890
Culp!

3405
02:28:10,130 --> 02:28:10,290
Culp!

3406
02:28:10,410 --> 02:28:10,810
Culp!

3407
02:28:11,150 --> 02:28:11,330
Culp!

3408
02:28:16,670 --> 02:28:17,350
Wa...

3409
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:18,290
Wa...

3410
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:19,670
Wa net in.

3411
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:21,910
Oh...

3412
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:22,970
How cute!

3413
02:28:23,730 --> 02:28:24,230
Wait!

3414
02:28:25,470 --> 02:28:25,950
Wait!

3415
02:28:26,270 --> 02:28:28,250
I think this is where I stole the horse.

3416
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:29,410
I mean, borrowed the horse.

3417
02:28:32,470 --> 02:28:36,290
I think this is where I got the horse from and then I fled.

3418
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:38,550
I think so.

3419
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:41,210
Aw...

3420
02:28:42,090 --> 02:28:43,230
Aw, good memories.

3421
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:45,490
What's that fire over there?

3422
02:28:45,550 --> 02:28:46,370
Let's go check it out.

3423
02:28:47,770 --> 02:28:48,330
Yeah!

3424
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:49,410
The stables!

3425
02:28:52,510 --> 02:28:54,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3426
02:28:55,930 --> 02:28:56,490
Aw...

3427
02:28:56,490 --> 02:28:57,610
You think they remember me?

3428
02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:05,010
I found the ghost!

3429
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:07,570
Ever need to sell expensive stuff?

3430
02:29:07,650 --> 02:29:08,830
The lady in the mystic emporium.

3431
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:13,090
Off the imperial city has tons of money and bad merchant skill.

3432
02:29:13,090 --> 02:29:13,770
Oh, nice!

3433
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:16,450
Wait, where was that fire coming from?

3434
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:17,970
Oh, right here.

3435
02:29:20,210 --> 02:29:21,270
Oh, a cave!

3436
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:23,890
Oh, boy.

3437
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:25,470
Someone was getting lady here.

3438
02:29:26,270 --> 02:29:27,250
Carrots and beer.

3439
02:29:29,210 --> 02:29:30,050
What was that?

3440
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:31,990
What are these?

3441
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:34,590
Why'd they throw their apples into the sea?

3442
02:29:38,190 --> 02:29:39,750
I gotta be careful around here.

3443
02:29:39,870 --> 02:29:40,690
There's mud crabs.

3444
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:42,090
Those guys suck.

3445
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:47,670
Oh, I stepped on the carrot.

3446
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:47,990
Oh.

3447
02:29:50,330 --> 02:29:51,370
Carrots and beer.

3448
02:29:51,610 --> 02:29:52,290
My favorite.

3449
02:29:53,670 --> 02:29:56,350
Kinda wish I could've had that pastry I got earlier.

3450
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:01,730
So I need to go...

3451
02:30:01,730 --> 02:30:02,790
to that way.

3452
02:30:05,950 --> 02:30:07,130
Maybe I should go inside.

3453
02:30:17,170 --> 02:30:18,890
Always take a pastry break.

3454
02:30:20,130 --> 02:30:20,690
Maybe.

3455
02:30:21,170 --> 02:30:21,570
Maybe.

3456
02:30:26,050 --> 02:30:26,690
No.

3457
02:30:29,250 --> 02:30:31,970
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is where I took...

3458
02:30:31,970 --> 02:30:32,830
got the horse.

3459
02:30:33,790 --> 02:30:34,430
Borrowed.

3460
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:36,950
They'll watch over my horse.

3461
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:40,210
I wonder if they remember me.

3462
02:30:40,990 --> 02:30:41,710
Wow, let's see!

3463
02:30:41,870 --> 02:30:42,510
Oh, my gosh!

3464
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:44,930
There are so many horses here!

3465
02:30:46,010 --> 02:30:47,560
And they couldn't let one...

3466
02:30:48,310 --> 02:30:50,010
They couldn't let me have one?

3467
02:30:51,250 --> 02:30:53,130
Look at how pretty this one is.

3468
02:30:53,590 --> 02:30:54,850
Oh, there's a guy here.

3469
02:30:55,330 --> 02:30:56,510
Are you watching over the horses?

3470
02:30:56,930 --> 02:30:58,010
Oh, hello.

3471
02:30:58,010 --> 02:31:00,090
I'm Brilis Gawi.

3472
02:31:00,310 --> 02:31:00,350
I'm Brilis Gawi.

3473
02:31:00,350 --> 02:31:02,210
And no, we don't sell horses.

3474
02:31:02,410 --> 02:31:03,890
But we do eat well.

3475
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:06,630
The stables are owned by an orc.

3476
02:31:06,810 --> 02:31:08,130
And you know...

3477
02:31:08,130 --> 02:31:10,310
Orcs and horses...

3478
02:31:10,930 --> 02:31:11,810
What does that mean?

3479
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:14,110
Goodbye.

3480
02:31:14,370 --> 02:31:15,790
Why don't you sell any of them?

3481
02:31:16,570 --> 02:31:17,610
There's so many.

3482
02:31:18,130 --> 02:31:19,890
What do you do with all these horses?

3483
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:22,330
What do they mean with...

3484
02:31:22,330 --> 02:31:24,510
Oh, they eat the horses?

3485
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:26,850
I thought they just ate dogs.

3486
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:30,370
I'm locking you in here.

3487
02:31:35,390 --> 02:31:36,470
I'm hungry.

3488
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:41,300
Oh, sorry.

3489
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:44,280
Hello.

3490
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:46,500
Oh, a snack.

3491
02:31:47,740 --> 02:31:48,280
Snakwabura.

3492
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:49,540
Owner and proprietor.

3493
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,600
We board horses and...

3494
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,900
Well, we don't actually sell horses.

3495
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:55,100
Anymore, that is.

3496
02:31:56,120 --> 02:31:57,000
Why not?

3497
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:58,400
You got anything useful for me?

3498
02:31:58,420 --> 02:31:59,700
What can I interest you in?

3499
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:03,260
I'd like...

3500
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:03,940
Armor.

3501
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:07,720
What kind of armor can we get?

3502
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:08,060
Wait.

3503
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:09,660
I'm an elf, technically.

3504
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:14,120
I'm an elf, technically, so...

3505
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:17,220
The fabled horse armor.

3506
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:22,600
Which one should I get?

3507
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:27,800
Seal armor or elven armor?

3508
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:32,180
Elven armor is fancier.

3509
02:32:32,360 --> 02:32:33,040
Say no more.

3510
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:34,380
Here you are.

3511
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:35,920
Just like I promised.

3512
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:38,960
Thanks again for all the help.

3513
02:32:39,820 --> 02:32:40,380
Oh.

3514
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:42,760
Armored my horse for free.

3515
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:45,360
From now on, she will outfit any legally owned...

3516
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:52,840
Any legally owned horse that I bring to her with steel or elven armor.

3517
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:54,620
For 500 gold.

3518
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:55,800
Pricey.

3519
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:56,960
Let's see.

3520
02:32:57,020 --> 02:32:57,520
Oh my gosh.

3521
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:02,100
Oh, I'm closing my eyes.

3522
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:04,340
How does she look?

3523
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:06,240
How does she look?

3524
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:10,180
Oh.

3525
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:23,080
Oh.

3526
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:24,220
Oh.

3527
02:33:24,660 --> 02:33:25,060
Wow.

3528
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:27,540
This is...

3529
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:32,080
Oh, I didn't expect it to be so...

3530
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,240
Gaudy.

3531
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,860
It's so...

3532
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:40,680
Oh, wow.

3533
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:43,360
Paid to win horse.

3534
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:44,440
You guys have...

3535
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:46,980
I have no ill feelings towards the armor.

3536
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:51,040
That will be $5, please.

3537
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:54,100
We said it was fancy.

3538
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:56,020
This is like...

3539
02:33:56,020 --> 02:33:56,540
Something else.

3540
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:58,300
No.

3541
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:01,640
I remember being here.

3542
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:02,620
Okay.

3543
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:04,760
Let's just follow the red arrow.

3544
02:34:06,860 --> 02:34:07,640
There.

3545
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:10,540
This way.

3546
02:34:12,260 --> 02:34:13,320
What is it, citizen?

3547
02:34:13,660 --> 02:34:13,960
Nothing.

3548
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:15,420
Don't bother me.

3549
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:18,800
I don't know any colors.

3550
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:20,360
Especially I don't know a color gray.

3551
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,460
I think the word is ornate.

3552
02:34:23,060 --> 02:34:23,180
Yeah.

3553
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:23,540
Oh.

3554
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:25,120
What am I doing?

3555
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:26,080
Oh my gosh.

3556
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:26,680
Wait, hold on.

3557
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:30,260
I think I just discovered a cat claw in my chair.

3558
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:31,920
I was like, something's poking me.

3559
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,820
I think there's a cat claw stuck in my chair.

3560
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,100
I nearly forgot.

3561
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:39,320
Happy Mother's Day.

3562
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:40,640
Oh, oh, oh.

3563
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:42,920
You have my ear, citizen.

3564
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:43,360
Goodbye.

3565
02:34:46,500 --> 02:34:48,640
It might have been...

3566
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:51,580
Blue Tidal has been sleeping in my chair lately.

3567
02:34:51,580 --> 02:34:52,400
It might have been him.

3568
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:55,060
Uh...

3569
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:55,700
This way?

3570
02:35:00,890 --> 02:35:01,630
This way.

3571
02:35:03,070 --> 02:35:04,710
Yeah, cats shed...

3572
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:06,570
Them all the time.

3573
02:35:06,790 --> 02:35:07,690
It's nothing...

3574
02:35:07,690 --> 02:35:08,190
Unusual.

3575
02:35:09,150 --> 02:35:11,730
To just be walking around and seeing a...

3576
02:35:11,730 --> 02:35:13,950
A cat claw on my floor.

3577
02:35:14,670 --> 02:35:15,770
Happens all the time.

3578
02:35:16,990 --> 02:35:17,570
Oh!

3579
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:19,170
Oh, this is not my horse.

3580
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:21,710
This is plain boring horse.

3581
02:35:24,490 --> 02:35:26,930
So it's still technically night time, I think.

3582
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:31,430
This is where I need to wait?

3583
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:33,370
Or...

3584
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:36,630
Over on the other side.

3585
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:39,290
How do I get around?

3586
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:39,850
Oh, here we go.

3587
02:35:44,590 --> 02:35:47,870
You have my ears, making a lot of money for the tribes and elsewhere.

3588
02:35:48,410 --> 02:35:50,970
And a lot of that is going to the Rinridra Kryn.

3589
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:54,770
If the Empire isn't going to stop the skooma trade, who will?

3590
02:35:55,370 --> 02:35:55,750
Goodbye.

3591
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:56,370
Goodbye.

3592
02:35:56,850 --> 02:35:58,330
Oh, hey, sweet lady of Weyrest.

3593
02:35:58,710 --> 02:36:00,370
Oh, hey, sweet lady of mine.

3594
02:36:00,570 --> 02:36:01,410
I'll see you again.

3595
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:02,570
Yes, I'll see you again.

3596
02:36:02,830 --> 02:36:04,730
Sweet lady of Weyrest so fine.

3597
02:36:05,070 --> 02:36:05,550
Speak...

3598
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:06,490
Oh, God.

3599
02:36:14,220 --> 02:36:16,100
Oh, sweet lady of Weyrest.

3600
02:36:16,220 --> 02:36:16,880
Oh, sweet lady of Weyrest.

3601
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:17,860
Oh, sweet lady of Weyrest.

3602
02:36:18,140 --> 02:36:19,100
Wait, where did he go?

3603
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:19,560
Oh, there he is.

3604
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:20,800
I need to speak to you.

3605
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:22,040
He's a pirate!

3606
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:22,540
I ain't got nothing to say to your fancy chance.

3607
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:24,780
So why don't you mind your own business, huh?

3608
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:26,940
Wait, you sang your little shanty at me.

3609
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:30,020
Wait, I wanna be a pirate too.

3610
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:47,360
Oh, shit.

3611
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:49,560
Yeah, they're terrible.

3612
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:52,780
Don't board the boat.

3613
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:55,040
Oh, hey, sweet lady of Weyrest.

3614
02:36:55,320 --> 02:36:57,180
Oh, hey, sweet lady of mine.

3615
02:36:57,440 --> 02:36:58,140
I'll see you again.

3616
02:36:58,280 --> 02:36:59,260
Yes, I'll see you again.

3617
02:36:59,500 --> 02:36:59,520
Yes, I'll see you again.

3618
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:01,420
Sweet lady of Weyrest so fine.

3619
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:05,000
What happens if I board the boat?

3620
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:07,280
Oh!

3621
02:37:10,480 --> 02:37:11,000
Understandable.

3622
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:11,480
Stay away!

3623
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:14,440
Get him!

3624
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:15,380
Get him!

3625
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:16,180
He's puny!

3626
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:17,600
Puny ancus!

3627
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:19,460
Get puny anus!

3628
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:20,100
Oh, God.

3629
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:20,540
Okay.

3630
02:37:21,060 --> 02:37:21,640
Run away!

3631
02:37:23,380 --> 02:37:24,780
I wanna be a pirate!

3632
02:37:26,980 --> 02:37:28,100
I wanna be a pirate!

3633
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:28,800
I wanna be a pirate, please!

3634
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:30,520
I wanna be a pirate, please!

3635
02:37:35,430 --> 02:37:36,430
They can't swim.

3636
02:37:36,730 --> 02:37:37,950
That's why they ride boats.

3637
02:37:46,270 --> 02:37:46,890
Wait, no!

3638
02:37:47,030 --> 02:37:49,310
I want my guy to stay alive so he'll sing for me!

3639
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:51,170
Wait, don't kill them!

3640
02:37:51,790 --> 02:37:52,230
No!

3641
02:37:59,330 --> 02:38:00,010
No!

3642
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:10,040
She's even got buckled shoes.

3643
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:13,400
Oh, sweet lady of mine.

3644
02:38:14,100 --> 02:38:14,780
How do I...

3645
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:15,700
How do I reload?

3646
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:19,260
Silver arrows!

3647
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:20,060
Oh!

3648
02:38:21,020 --> 02:38:22,060
Oh my God.

3649
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:26,670
I'm only asking for a single coin.

3650
02:38:26,830 --> 02:38:27,190
Oh, wait.

3651
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:28,930
This must be where we see him then.

3652
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:30,770
Lighthouse.

3653
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:39,060
There should be an autosave.

3654
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:40,040
I already autosaved.

3655
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:42,480
I wanna auto-reload so that they aren't dead.

3656
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:46,000
F9.

3657
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:51,050
Let's see if this works.

3658
02:38:52,470 --> 02:38:53,490
Thank you!

3659
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:57,770
There once was a hardy young lad of the sea.

3660
02:38:58,130 --> 02:39:01,010
A red god of courage and honor was he.

3661
02:39:01,330 --> 02:39:03,830
Sail on my Cyrus Sail on.

3662
02:39:03,830 --> 02:39:05,470
Beautiful, isn't she?

3663
02:39:05,710 --> 02:39:07,290
The Marie Elena.

3664
02:39:07,710 --> 02:39:07,830
Yeah.

3665
02:39:08,170 --> 02:39:09,330
Damn fine ship.

3666
02:39:09,530 --> 02:39:09,650
Yeah.

3667
02:39:09,650 --> 02:39:10,890
With a damn fine crew.

3668
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:12,470
I should know.

3669
02:39:12,670 --> 02:39:13,890
I'm her first mate.

3670
02:39:14,530 --> 02:39:15,770
Malvulus is my name.

3671
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:21,150
So believe me when I tell you we don't like it when people snoop around in our affairs.

3672
02:39:21,530 --> 02:39:21,590
Oh.

3673
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:25,430
You get near that ship and my men will run you through.

3674
02:39:25,990 --> 02:39:27,870
I wanna join you.

3675
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:30,890
Let me join the pirates.

3676
02:39:32,190 --> 02:39:33,090
What's here?

3677
02:39:34,490 --> 02:39:35,670
What's this little area?

3678
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:36,090
It's cute.

3679
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:38,810
It's shack.

3680
02:39:40,650 --> 02:39:41,450
Hmm.

3681
02:39:43,170 --> 02:39:43,850
Okay.

3682
02:39:45,350 --> 02:39:47,110
I'm going to let...

3683
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:50,130
The game...

3684
02:39:50,130 --> 02:39:51,030
We gotta...

3685
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:51,550
Oh gosh.

3686
02:39:53,390 --> 02:39:54,570
What's this?

3687
02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:56,050
Interesting.

3688
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:58,970
We gotta meet the guys...

3689
02:39:59,390 --> 02:40:00,590
Somewhere over here?

3690
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,590
Who are you?

3691
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:05,590
What can I do for you?

3692
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:06,850
Nice.

3693
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:07,830
Accessories.

3694
02:40:08,170 --> 02:40:08,930
Oh, you can't do...

3695
02:40:08,930 --> 02:40:09,990
You can't do anything for me.

3696
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:10,830
Farewell.

3697
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:11,790
What's in here?

3698
02:40:12,390 --> 02:40:12,730
Nothing.

3699
02:40:13,090 --> 02:40:13,230
Okay.

3700
02:40:13,430 --> 02:40:13,850
Oh, ooh.

3701
02:40:14,770 --> 02:40:16,070
We're meeting in...

3702
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:17,310
Here?

3703
02:40:17,890 --> 02:40:18,650
At midnight?

3704
02:40:18,650 --> 02:40:19,710
Is this where it is?

3705
02:40:20,650 --> 02:40:22,290
Yeah, I'm gonna let the game run.

3706
02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:24,170
And I'm gonna go out to get my...

3707
02:40:24,170 --> 02:40:24,950
My pastry.

3708
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:26,050
And then I'm gonna eat it.

3709
02:40:27,610 --> 02:40:28,730
It has to be midnight.

3710
02:40:29,150 --> 02:40:30,210
We'll just let the day...

3711
02:40:31,870 --> 02:40:32,550
Fade away.

3712
02:40:32,710 --> 02:40:33,970
But I'm gonna get my...

3713
02:40:33,970 --> 02:40:36,350
Cuz I gotta put it on a plate and it's kinda messy.

3714
02:40:37,870 --> 02:40:38,270
So...

3715
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:39,090
Let me go get that.

3716
02:40:39,190 --> 02:40:41,370
I'm getting kinda hungry, so...

3717
02:40:41,370 --> 02:40:41,490
Hmm.

3718
02:40:41,710 --> 02:40:43,270
A little short break, everybody.

3719
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:24,880
No!

3720
02:42:25,140 --> 02:42:25,880
I forgot my drink.

3721
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:26,760
Dang it.

3722
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:28,160
I just sat down with everything.

3723
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:29,720
I forgot my drink.

3724
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:31,220
What's happening?

3725
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:33,300
Why is the camera going around in a circle?

3726
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:34,620
What the?

3727
02:42:34,820 --> 02:42:36,060
Oh, is that like when it dies?

3728
02:42:36,220 --> 02:42:36,760
When it's idle?

3729
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:40,020
Is that what it dies?

3730
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:43,260
It's just cinematic.

3731
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:45,040
Fancy.

3732
02:42:45,100 --> 02:42:45,580
What time is it?

3733
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:47,780
Only 8am.

3734
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:50,120
It circles your character.

3735
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:50,580
Ooh.

3736
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:53,780
Let me go get my drink.

3737
02:43:35,980 --> 02:43:37,060
Thank you, guys.

3738
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:37,920
Thank you.

3739
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:39,920
Thank you.

3740
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:40,460
Thank you.

3741
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:42,120
Oh, no.

3742
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:44,160
Alright.

3743
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:48,660
I wanna see it.

3744
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:49,460
I'm not gonna touch it.

3745
02:43:49,700 --> 02:43:50,920
I wanna see it go idle.

3746
02:43:52,460 --> 02:43:53,800
Sashkin, thank you so much for the vibe.

3747
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,180
Good to...

3748
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:54,720
Thank you.

3749
02:43:55,140 --> 02:43:55,760
Okie dokie.

3750
02:43:56,260 --> 02:43:57,240
Time to try this.

3751
02:43:58,120 --> 02:43:59,080
But more properly.

3752
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:00,460
Since I got a plate this time.

3753
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:01,460
Ow.

3754
02:44:08,650 --> 02:44:08,970
Mmm.

3755
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:13,120
I'd rather not.

3756
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:14,300
Thank you so much for the tengeton.

3757
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:14,800
Thank you.

3758
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:16,580
Oh my gosh.

3759
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:17,520
The cream is so good.

3760
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:18,840
It's like a...

3761
02:44:19,500 --> 02:44:20,360
Tart-ish.

3762
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:21,020
Tart?

3763
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:29,040
Mmm.

3764
02:44:32,340 --> 02:44:33,560
Oh, it's so yummy.

3765
02:44:33,560 --> 02:44:33,580
Me.

3766
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:37,620
Oh...

3767
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:39,060
Oh...

3768
02:44:39,060 --> 02:44:39,760
Oh...

3769
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,020
Did you get it again?

3770
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:42,700
Mm-hmm.

3771
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,440
Yeah, it would.

3772
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:48,760
Oh, here it is.

3773
02:44:57,130 --> 02:44:57,770
Yum man.

3774
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:02,890
Wow, the cream is so good.

3775
02:45:04,230 --> 02:45:14,930
I guess it's just like a normal whipped cream, but... it's like a little more... it's not so... it's not so... like, whippy.

3776
02:45:15,330 --> 02:45:16,530
It's a little more hard.

3777
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:28,660
Are we supposed to look like E.T.

3778
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:29,200
with hair?

3779
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:31,300
Oh, yeah, this is E.T.E.N.A.

3780
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:33,980
Oh, whoops.

3781
02:45:35,540 --> 02:45:35,700
See?

3782
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:37,400
E.T.E.N.A.

3783
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:49,080
Hold on, I have some more fruit.

3784
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:51,040
For my fruit salad.

3785
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:54,280
That I just dropped in my lap.

3786
02:45:55,020 --> 02:45:55,440
No!

3787
02:45:57,620 --> 02:45:58,140
Ooh!

3788
02:45:58,140 --> 02:45:58,580
Ooh, it's cold.

3789
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:02,930
Yummy.

3790
02:46:04,490 --> 02:46:06,030
I have to wash my pants now.

3791
02:46:15,270 --> 02:46:16,510
Let's go talk to somebody.

3792
02:46:18,450 --> 02:46:19,650
Since there were people here.

3793
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:23,850
We can go into somebody's house.

3794
02:46:26,030 --> 02:46:26,830
A bed?

3795
02:46:26,830 --> 02:46:26,970
We can go into somebody's house again.

3796
02:46:32,070 --> 02:46:32,750
Or...

3797
02:46:32,750 --> 02:46:34,970
E.T.E.N.A.'s shack.

3798
02:46:36,270 --> 02:46:37,050
Oh, empty sack.

3799
02:46:37,970 --> 02:46:39,010
This one's not empty.

3800
02:46:41,590 --> 02:46:42,270
Oh?

3801
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:45,210
Is this...

3802
02:46:45,210 --> 02:46:48,430
This could be E.T.E.N.A.'s...

3803
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:49,490
place.

3804
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:53,810
Wait, the fire's already lit.

3805
02:46:57,550 --> 02:46:58,230
Wait.

3806
02:46:59,270 --> 02:47:02,390
One of the shacks is for sale by the real estate agency.

3807
02:47:02,750 --> 02:47:02,790
Oh!

3808
02:47:04,450 --> 02:47:06,570
E.T.E.N.A.'s new home!

3809
02:47:11,710 --> 02:47:12,580
Oh, my God.

3810
02:47:22,130 --> 02:47:23,200
This is so...

3811
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:24,420
ASMR, no?

3812
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:26,680
Oblivion BGM.

3813
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:28,720
Fireplace crackling.

3814
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:30,920
Minto eating her pastry.

3815
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:43,780
Mech joined a pirate crew once.

3816
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:45,300
Mech did not recommend it.

3817
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:48,000
No one told Mech the sea is wet.

3818
02:47:48,580 --> 02:47:50,520
But she says your name is a liar.

3819
02:47:54,190 --> 02:47:56,430
Get deep, scorn, hollow.

3820
02:47:57,330 --> 02:47:58,110
Where's that?

3821
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:07,950
If you put items in most containers, they'll disappear.

3822
02:48:07,950 --> 02:48:10,730
Only owned homes in a certain inn room are safe.

3823
02:48:10,870 --> 02:48:11,230
Oh, no!

3824
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:12,330
Oh, God.

3825
02:48:17,870 --> 02:48:19,110
Bottom right of the map.

3826
02:48:21,530 --> 02:48:22,370
We'll go there.

3827
02:48:22,510 --> 02:48:23,850
Sorry for that food break, guys.

3828
02:48:26,470 --> 02:48:27,330
Sorry, sorry.

3829
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:46,950
Containers regenerate their contents is why.

3830
02:48:47,130 --> 02:48:48,650
Oh, that's exciting to know.

3831
02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:51,010
So I can always take the same gold.

3832
02:48:51,390 --> 02:48:51,830
Eventually.

3833
02:48:58,730 --> 02:49:10,800
I can always take a few

3834
02:49:14,950 --> 02:49:16,450
days to respawn in-game, right?

3835
02:49:16,910 --> 02:49:18,370
A few in-game days?

3836
02:49:27,410 --> 02:49:28,150
In-game.

3837
02:49:28,290 --> 02:49:28,510
Oh, God.

3838
02:49:33,110 --> 02:49:34,290
This is so yummy.

3839
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:38,050
I just had some pizza slices myself.

3840
02:49:38,290 --> 02:49:39,270
Mmm, pizza.

3841
02:49:40,610 --> 02:49:41,990
I wish I got pizza.

3842
02:49:43,730 --> 02:49:45,750
I didn't even get pizza on Pizza Friday.

3843
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:49,270
Probably shouldn't have pizza every Friday.

3844
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:56,780
And then I get a big pizza.

3845
02:49:57,060 --> 02:49:58,880
Because it's the cheapest for some reason.

3846
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:00,900
Oh, my gosh.

3847
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:02,520
Thank you so much for the 15th gift.

3848
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:03,760
Thank you.

3849
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:04,820
Thank you so much.

3850
02:50:07,640 --> 02:50:08,900
I get pizza.

3851
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:09,760
A big pizza.

3852
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:11,200
Because it's cheaper that way.

3853
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,620
And then...

3854
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,200
And then...

3855
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:15,300
And then...

3856
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:17,840
I end up having pizza for like four days.

3857
02:50:30,950 --> 02:50:32,470
That sounds awesome.

3858
02:50:35,630 --> 02:50:36,590
I don't know.

3859
02:50:36,990 --> 02:50:38,110
I mean, it's not bad.

3860
02:50:38,110 --> 02:50:39,130
But it's not...

3861
02:50:39,130 --> 02:50:40,910
It's not exactly what I want.

3862
02:50:41,990 --> 02:50:44,290
Why can't I just get a small pizza for cheap?

3863
02:50:55,850 --> 02:50:58,930
I have pizza every Friday in college at a club event for years.

3864
02:50:59,110 --> 02:51:01,110
And I couldn't look at it for years after.

3865
02:51:01,470 --> 02:51:01,770
Right?

3866
02:51:03,050 --> 02:51:04,110
Yeah, I imagine.

3867
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:06,810
Banana.

3868
02:51:10,230 --> 02:51:13,490
No, because the place that I get my pizza always has a deal.

3869
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:16,590
But it's like the two toppings for a large pizza.

3870
02:51:17,830 --> 02:51:19,930
And I get the two toppings.

3871
02:51:20,150 --> 02:51:22,990
Or it's like several toppings for a large pizza.

3872
02:51:23,250 --> 02:51:24,630
I get the couple toppings.

3873
02:51:24,930 --> 02:51:27,430
But I want like a small pizza.

3874
02:51:28,390 --> 02:51:30,110
I don't want a large pizza.

3875
02:51:30,390 --> 02:51:31,610
It's just for me.

3876
02:51:41,090 --> 02:51:43,830
Otherwise, it's gonna be like twice the price.

3877
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:45,670
Of what I get.

3878
02:51:49,190 --> 02:51:50,470
Even though I...

3879
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:52,570
I...

3880
02:51:53,790 --> 02:51:54,450
Want...

3881
02:51:56,970 --> 02:51:59,470
I just want a small...

3882
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:08,120
Oh well.

3883
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:16,720
Still don't see the issue.

3884
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:18,880
Because I don't want to eat so much pizza.

3885
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:20,600
That's the issue.

3886
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:23,240
I...

3887
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:26,580
I want to eat only a small amount of pizza.

3888
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:28,300
And then be like...

3889
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:28,540
Okay.

3890
02:52:28,740 --> 02:52:30,500
If I eat so much pizza...

3891
02:52:30,500 --> 02:52:31,440
I'll feel...

3892
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:32,080
Terrible.

3893
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:37,080
Such a nuisance to pay double for properly sized porridge.

3894
02:52:38,740 --> 02:52:39,340
Yeah.

3895
02:52:39,620 --> 02:52:39,960
Exactly.

3896
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:46,800
Okay.

3897
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:47,560
What I'll do...

3898
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:51,040
I'll eat what I want...

3899
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:52,440
And I'll leave the leftovers outside.

3900
02:52:56,140 --> 02:52:58,240
And then you guys can...

3901
02:52:58,240 --> 02:53:00,080
Come over and nibble on the rest.

3902
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:03,860
First come, first serve.

3903
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:07,320
Outside the maid cafe.

3904
02:53:08,980 --> 02:53:10,660
You're not a ninja turtle?

3905
02:53:17,210 --> 02:53:18,830
You can freeze pizza.

3906
02:53:19,590 --> 02:53:20,970
I never thought of that.

3907
02:53:24,220 --> 02:53:25,760
I never thought of doing that.

3908
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:28,780
My mom freezes everything.

3909
02:53:29,300 --> 02:53:31,280
Yesterday she gave me frozen croissants.

3910
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:32,680
And I was like...

3911
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:33,900
How long have these been in there?

3912
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:37,240
Actually, my sister had a discussion with my mom yesterday.

3913
02:53:37,240 --> 02:53:37,940
She was like...

3914
02:53:39,060 --> 02:53:39,780
She was like...

3915
02:53:39,780 --> 02:53:41,400
Mom, I went and cleared out your fridge.

3916
02:53:41,560 --> 02:53:44,100
You had things from 1999 in there.

3917
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:48,820
Or no, it was the pantry.

3918
02:53:52,320 --> 02:53:53,980
And my mom was like...

3919
02:53:53,980 --> 02:53:55,260
It was good cake mix.

3920
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:02,000
Can you hear?

3921
02:54:03,960 --> 02:54:05,240
Can you hear the grape?

3922
02:54:15,830 --> 02:54:16,790
Vintage cake.

3923
02:54:17,150 --> 02:54:17,830
Yeah, pretty much.

3924
02:54:20,810 --> 02:54:21,290
No?

3925
02:54:21,510 --> 02:54:21,830
Okay, good.

3926
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:24,770
Don't listen to me eat.

3927
02:54:25,870 --> 02:54:27,390
I get self-conscious.

3928
02:54:32,030 --> 02:54:33,430
Alright, I'm almost done.

3929
02:54:40,430 --> 02:54:43,350
We wasted a sufficient amount of time.

3930
02:54:43,810 --> 02:54:44,330
Not money.

3931
02:54:49,250 --> 02:54:50,470
Ever eaten an art?

3932
02:54:50,550 --> 02:54:52,490
Oh, like the MRE?

3933
02:54:52,490 --> 02:54:55,150
No, I've always wanted to try one, but...

3934
02:54:55,150 --> 02:54:55,970
I'm scared.

3935
02:55:12,300 --> 02:55:15,740
You was in the chat joking about the idea of saving leftover pizza by freezing.

3936
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:17,040
What do you mean joking?

3937
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:22,280
I used to eat MREs a few times a year.

3938
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:23,780
I...

3939
02:55:23,780 --> 02:55:24,520
Like...

3940
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:35,740
He was following me.

3941
02:55:46,190 --> 02:55:47,850
He didn't come out.

3942
02:55:56,630 --> 02:56:02,170
I heard this place was abandoned.

3943
02:56:06,430 --> 02:56:07,550
Oh, okay.

3944
02:56:08,230 --> 02:56:09,710
I'm through talking to you.

3945
02:56:09,970 --> 02:56:10,510
I'm...

3946
02:56:10,510 --> 02:56:11,730
Likewise.

3947
02:56:11,730 --> 02:56:13,570
I'm the one who ended the conversation.

3948
02:56:14,110 --> 02:56:14,610
Jerk.

3949
02:56:17,490 --> 02:56:18,270
Okay.

3950
02:56:21,470 --> 02:56:22,510
I don't...

3951
02:56:22,510 --> 02:56:23,150
I'm not fired.

3952
02:56:23,150 --> 02:56:23,670
I quit.

3953
02:56:24,370 --> 02:56:25,650
Energy over here.

3954
02:56:30,310 --> 02:56:31,090
Hello.

3955
02:56:33,070 --> 02:56:33,460
Uh...

3956
02:56:34,030 --> 02:56:34,810
Hi.

3957
02:56:35,130 --> 02:56:36,330
Do I know you?

3958
02:56:38,930 --> 02:56:41,130
You say a beggar told you to seek me out?

3959
02:56:41,750 --> 02:56:42,930
Good enough for me, then.

3960
02:56:43,630 --> 02:56:45,530
The beggars are the eyes and ears of the Grey Fox.

3961
02:56:45,550 --> 02:56:45,850
Wait, no.

3962
02:56:45,930 --> 02:56:46,470
I got a letter.

3963
02:56:46,810 --> 02:56:47,870
He is the king of thieves in Syria.

3964
02:56:47,870 --> 02:56:48,490
I got a letter.

3965
02:56:48,910 --> 02:56:52,150
You could think of him as our guilt master, although he would deny that title.

3966
02:56:54,130 --> 02:56:54,530
Uh...

3967
02:56:54,530 --> 02:56:55,030
Can I do...

3968
02:56:55,030 --> 02:56:55,770
Oh, mysterious note.

3969
02:56:56,390 --> 02:56:57,270
Ah, yes.

3970
02:56:58,250 --> 02:57:01,110
Another scoundrel who served time in an imperial jail.

3971
02:57:01,730 --> 02:57:05,190
The Grey Fox is offering you a chance to join the thieves' guild.

3972
02:57:05,430 --> 02:57:05,810
Yes.

3973
02:57:06,450 --> 02:57:07,730
Join the thieves' guild.

3974
02:57:08,090 --> 02:57:08,630
Everyone is here.

3975
02:57:08,870 --> 02:57:09,390
Let's begin.

3976
02:57:09,830 --> 02:57:12,470
Each of you is seeking membership in the thieves' guild.

3977
02:57:12,850 --> 02:57:14,650
The thieves' guild is not a myth.

3978
02:57:15,130 --> 02:57:18,090
We are followers of the Grey Fox, and I am his doyen.

3979
02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:22,070
Merely by finding me, you have passed the first test.

3980
02:57:22,170 --> 02:57:22,770
There's tests?

3981
02:57:23,050 --> 02:57:27,010
It's unusual for us to have three potential recruits at the same time.

3982
02:57:27,010 --> 02:57:31,530
Rather than the normal test of skill, I'm going to make this a contest.

3983
02:57:31,930 --> 02:57:32,050
Oh.

3984
02:57:32,930 --> 02:57:33,930
That's not fair.

3985
02:57:35,090 --> 02:57:36,490
Methredel, you know the rules.

3986
02:57:36,710 --> 02:57:41,310
However, for Amusei and the newcomer, let me state them clearly.

3987
02:57:42,250 --> 02:57:47,250
Whoever brings me the diary of Amantius Electus without killing him...

3988
02:57:48,990 --> 02:57:49,830
Amantius Electus.

3989
02:57:51,030 --> 02:57:52,670
I'll have it before sunrise.

3990
02:57:54,310 --> 02:57:58,570
Somewhere in the Imperial City, the beggars will help you locate it for a price.

3991
02:57:59,170 --> 02:58:01,350
I can sell you lockpicks if you need them.

3992
02:58:01,990 --> 02:58:02,470
Okay.

3993
02:58:02,750 --> 02:58:03,270
One more thing.

3994
02:58:04,010 --> 02:58:06,330
You cannot kill each other during this trial.

3995
02:58:06,810 --> 02:58:09,810
We may be thieves, but we're not murderers.

3996
02:58:11,610 --> 02:58:13,290
May the best thief win.

3997
02:58:13,530 --> 02:58:14,190
Oh, no.

3998
02:58:14,550 --> 02:58:14,710
Wait.

3999
02:58:15,050 --> 02:58:16,930
Can they also pickpocket me?

4000
02:58:18,570 --> 02:58:21,970
I spoke with Armand Kristoff, who is a member of the thieves' guild.

4001
02:58:22,050 --> 02:58:24,590
He offered me a chance to join the guild, but I have to compete against two other thieves.

4002
02:58:25,310 --> 02:58:25,670
Meth...

4003
02:58:25,670 --> 02:58:26,370
Meth...

4004
02:58:27,230 --> 02:58:27,710
Meth...

4005
02:58:27,710 --> 02:58:28,230
Meth...

4006
02:58:28,230 --> 02:58:28,490
Meth...

4007
02:58:28,490 --> 02:58:29,150
Meth...

4008
02:58:29,150 --> 02:58:29,390
Meth...

4009
02:58:29,390 --> 02:58:29,410
Meth...

4010
02:58:29,410 --> 02:58:29,550
Meth...

4011
02:58:33,030 --> 02:58:33,450
Methid...

4012
02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:36,610
And Amusei.

4013
02:58:37,710 --> 02:58:44,170
Whichever of us steals Amantius Electus' diary first will be inducted into the thieves' guild.

4014
02:58:47,150 --> 02:58:51,210
Somewhere in the Imperial City, he told me that the beggars might be able to help...

4015
02:58:51,210 --> 02:58:52,430
Oh, tell me where to find him.

4016
02:58:52,870 --> 02:58:55,030
Maybe he lives in the Elven Gardens District.

4017
02:58:55,230 --> 02:58:55,590
Oh, shoot.

4018
02:58:57,130 --> 02:58:57,550
Uh...

4019
02:58:57,550 --> 02:58:57,650
Oh.

4020
02:58:59,770 --> 02:59:00,190
Wait.

4021
02:59:04,570 --> 02:59:05,750
You've got my ear.

4022
02:59:05,850 --> 02:59:06,770
I'm faster than you?

4023
02:59:08,090 --> 02:59:09,670
You have my ear, Cecil.

4024
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:12,310
Um...

4025
02:59:12,750 --> 02:59:13,150
Nope.

4026
02:59:15,570 --> 02:59:15,970
Uh...

4027
02:59:15,970 --> 02:59:16,650
How do I get inside?

4028
02:59:16,910 --> 02:59:17,430
To the city?

4029
02:59:17,630 --> 02:59:17,810
Nope.

4030
02:59:18,410 --> 02:59:19,590
How do I get inside to the city?

4031
02:59:19,810 --> 02:59:20,430
Wait, where'd she go?

4032
02:59:20,610 --> 02:59:20,930
Oh, no.

4033
02:59:21,210 --> 02:59:22,490
Wait, how do I get inside to the city?

4034
02:59:22,810 --> 02:59:23,090
Uh-oh.

4035
02:59:24,410 --> 02:59:24,810
Uh...

4036
02:59:24,810 --> 02:59:25,470
Oh, shoot.

4037
02:59:25,650 --> 02:59:26,370
I'm lost?

4038
02:59:26,570 --> 02:59:26,930
Wait!

4039
02:59:27,490 --> 02:59:27,890
Wait!

4040
02:59:30,650 --> 02:59:32,170
I should've just followed her.

4041
02:59:35,250 --> 02:59:35,770
Here?

4042
02:59:36,150 --> 02:59:36,670
No?

4043
02:59:38,570 --> 02:59:39,090
Uh...

4044
02:59:39,090 --> 02:59:41,970
Maybe he lives in the Elven Gardens District.

4045
02:59:42,410 --> 02:59:44,070
How do I get inside the city?

4046
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:47,390
Hold on.

4047
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:48,950
I'm gonna make it my main quest.

4048
02:59:49,090 --> 02:59:49,190
Oh!

4049
02:59:49,410 --> 02:59:50,450
It is my main quest.

4050
02:59:51,390 --> 02:59:51,910
Here?

4051
02:59:53,270 --> 02:59:53,830
Speak.

4052
02:59:56,970 --> 02:59:57,530
Goodbye.

4053
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:02,660
What?

4054
03:00:24,390 --> 03:00:25,590
Around the wall.

4055
03:00:25,930 --> 03:00:26,630
Are you...

4056
03:00:26,630 --> 03:00:27,750
For real?

4057
03:00:27,990 --> 03:00:29,610
Oh, I came from over here.

4058
03:00:30,270 --> 03:00:30,830
Ah!

4059
03:00:31,370 --> 03:00:32,870
I came from over here before.

4060
03:00:32,950 --> 03:00:33,610
That's why.

4061
03:00:33,830 --> 03:00:34,610
Oh, my God.

4062
03:00:36,350 --> 03:00:37,090
Oh, yeah.

4063
03:00:37,210 --> 03:00:37,970
There he goes, too.

4064
03:00:38,070 --> 03:00:39,270
Maybe he lives in the Elven Gardens District.

4065
03:00:39,350 --> 03:00:39,910
Ugh!

4066
03:00:40,690 --> 03:00:41,630
I forgot.

4067
03:00:42,190 --> 03:00:43,350
Oh, my God.

4068
03:00:43,350 --> 03:00:43,970
Oh, wait.

4069
03:00:45,210 --> 03:00:46,050
Oh, nope.

4070
03:00:46,090 --> 03:00:46,510
That's a horse.

4071
03:00:46,910 --> 03:00:47,790
I thought that was her.

4072
03:00:54,940 --> 03:00:56,800
Oh, wait.

4073
03:01:01,260 --> 03:01:02,780
I'm gonna find somebody first.

4074
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:04,020
Before you.

4075
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:06,560
Gosh, I don't know where anybody's at.

4076
03:01:11,690 --> 03:01:12,710
Where are you going?

4077
03:01:14,250 --> 03:01:15,370
Excuse me!

4078
03:01:19,730 --> 03:01:21,790
She went right into his house!

4079
03:01:30,150 --> 03:01:30,950
Where is it?

4080
03:01:31,130 --> 03:01:31,570
In here?

4081
03:01:38,510 --> 03:01:39,630
Don't pickpocket me.

4082
03:01:48,410 --> 03:01:48,890
Run.

4083
03:01:58,080 --> 03:01:59,180
What is it, citizen?

4084
03:01:59,500 --> 03:01:59,840
Nothing.

4085
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:00,920
I'm a good citizen.

4086
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:01,940
Read it.

4087
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:02,800
Yeah, I need to.

4088
03:02:10,540 --> 03:02:11,020
Inventory.

4089
03:02:14,660 --> 03:02:16,420
Amantius Electus's Diary.

4090
03:02:17,880 --> 03:02:20,220
I've planted the seed of the drinkers.

4091
03:02:20,380 --> 03:02:22,520
Soon I shall know if my theories hold true.

4092
03:02:22,820 --> 03:02:24,200
The first shoots have appeared.

4093
03:02:24,460 --> 03:02:27,980
I must make sure to continue the precise schedule of nutrient solutions.

4094
03:02:28,360 --> 03:02:31,320
Small drinker fronds are clearly visible.

4095
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:33,580
This is a critical time in their development.

4096
03:02:33,860 --> 03:02:35,620
I'm almost out of rat blood.

4097
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:39,440
I'll have to catch some more of the filthy beggars.

4098
03:02:40,700 --> 03:02:43,100
The young plants are juveniles now.

4099
03:02:45,020 --> 03:02:48,000
I can see them waving as if in a breeze.

4100
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:50,660
Although the air in my cellar is still as death.

4101
03:02:50,940 --> 03:02:53,320
I'm having a hard time catching any more cats.

4102
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:55,820
I may have to start using dogs.

4103
03:02:56,340 --> 03:02:58,680
The damn drinker plants have a voracious apple.

4104
03:02:58,680 --> 03:02:59,360
Oh my gosh.

4105
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:02,540
They're making Seymour.

4106
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:05,320
Suddenly Seymour.

4107
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:05,560
No.

4108
03:03:06,460 --> 03:03:06,940
Tui.

4109
03:03:07,240 --> 03:03:07,980
They're making.

4110
03:03:08,200 --> 03:03:09,300
They're making Tui.

4111
03:03:09,620 --> 03:03:10,620
The plant.

4112
03:03:10,900 --> 03:03:12,740
From the musical.

4113
03:03:18,890 --> 03:03:20,330
Feed me, Seymour.

4114
03:03:20,730 --> 03:03:21,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4115
03:03:22,930 --> 03:03:23,670
Audrey too.

4116
03:03:23,910 --> 03:03:25,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4117
03:03:27,650 --> 03:03:29,750
Pinto swiped it right in front of his eyes.

4118
03:03:35,270 --> 03:03:39,850
Oh my god, he's gonna turn into a plant.

4119
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:41,950
Actually, I lied.

4120
03:03:42,210 --> 03:03:44,690
This is... this is Goosebumps.

4121
03:03:45,170 --> 03:03:47,030
My creations are refusing to feed.

4122
03:03:47,250 --> 03:03:51,510
As an experiment, I offered a drop of my own blood, which one of them drank greedily.

4123
03:03:51,510 --> 03:03:53,970
The other drinkers are beginning to wither.

4124
03:03:54,310 --> 03:03:57,350
I collected a bucket of human blood from the healers.

4125
03:03:57,490 --> 03:04:00,610
I had to pay her an exorbitant amount to keep her tongue still.

4126
03:04:00,930 --> 03:04:02,490
The drinkers are doing much better.

4127
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:03,810
Am I doing the right thing?

4128
03:04:03,930 --> 03:04:06,730
The benefit of these plants to all of Kyra...

4129
03:04:06,730 --> 03:04:08,470
How do you say this place's name again?

4130
03:04:09,670 --> 03:04:10,190
Cyrodiil?

4131
03:04:16,230 --> 03:04:16,970
Cyrodiil, okay.

4132
03:04:17,590 --> 03:04:19,830
Is beyond doubt, but the price may be too high.

4133
03:04:20,690 --> 03:04:23,330
It is one of the most difficult decisions of my life.

4134
03:04:23,450 --> 03:04:26,270
I have destroyed my notes for how to hybridize drinkers.

4135
03:04:26,490 --> 03:04:28,970
I set the trays on the roof where the sun could strike them.

4136
03:04:29,230 --> 03:04:31,110
An hour after sunrise, they were all dead.

4137
03:04:31,350 --> 03:04:34,590
My attempt to create a hybrid of vampire and plant has failed.

4138
03:04:34,810 --> 03:04:36,290
They were just too dangerous.

4139
03:04:39,750 --> 03:04:41,430
Successfully pickpocketing an NPC.

4140
03:04:43,130 --> 03:04:44,510
Two parts grave... oh!

4141
03:04:45,790 --> 03:04:46,850
Now we know.

4142
03:04:46,850 --> 03:04:54,130
Two parts grave dust, one part ash salt mixed with human blood exposed to two hours of moonlight each night.

4143
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:55,990
Running, running, running.

4144
03:05:00,370 --> 03:05:00,970
Oh!

4145
03:05:01,750 --> 03:05:03,730
Uh, are you not going or...?

4146
03:05:03,730 --> 03:05:04,450
Step aside!

4147
03:05:04,750 --> 03:05:06,650
I'm gonna win the right to join the guild.

4148
03:05:06,910 --> 03:05:08,310
You can't beat me.

4149
03:05:09,150 --> 03:05:10,970
You're going the frog way!

4150
03:05:17,440 --> 03:05:17,800
Okay.

4151
03:05:19,060 --> 03:05:19,460
Can I...

4152
03:05:19,460 --> 03:05:21,180
Oh, I was gonna say, can I get on the boat now?

4153
03:05:21,320 --> 03:05:22,080
But they're all still awake.

4154
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:23,240
To what do I owe this pleasure?

4155
03:05:27,990 --> 03:05:28,910
Are you confused?

4156
03:05:29,230 --> 03:05:29,510
No.

4157
03:05:29,790 --> 03:05:30,710
I've got the diary.

4158
03:05:31,850 --> 03:05:32,210
Wait.

4159
03:05:33,230 --> 03:05:33,930
I've got it.

4160
03:05:34,770 --> 03:05:35,630
Wait, I've got...

4161
03:05:37,410 --> 03:05:38,210
I got it.

4162
03:05:42,510 --> 03:05:43,870
You scared me!

4163
03:05:44,010 --> 03:05:46,090
You have earned the right to join the thieves guild.

4164
03:05:46,310 --> 03:05:46,830
Thank you.

4165
03:05:46,910 --> 03:05:49,990
You now owe your loyalty to our guild master, the Grey Fox.

4166
03:05:50,810 --> 03:05:52,970
He has three rules you must follow.

4167
03:05:53,110 --> 03:05:56,210
I thought it was gonna be a prompt that said the diary, you know, like...

4168
03:05:57,610 --> 03:05:58,430
Three rules.

4169
03:05:59,110 --> 03:06:02,530
First, never steal from another member of the guild.

4170
03:06:03,250 --> 03:06:05,910
Second, never kill anyone on the job.

4171
03:06:06,430 --> 03:06:08,150
This is not the Dark Brotherhood.

4172
03:06:08,670 --> 03:06:11,090
Animals and monsters can be slain if necessary.

4173
03:06:11,290 --> 03:06:12,950
He's just repeating exactly what I read before.

4174
03:06:13,190 --> 03:06:14,590
First, don't steal from the poor.

4175
03:06:15,370 --> 03:06:19,630
The peasants and beggars are under the personal protection of the Grey Fox.

4176
03:06:20,170 --> 03:06:22,050
Particularly here on the waterfront.

4177
03:06:25,690 --> 03:06:26,810
Wait, so...

4178
03:06:26,810 --> 03:06:30,390
It said don't murder on the job, but...

4179
03:06:30,390 --> 03:06:32,090
What if I'm not doing a job?

4180
03:06:32,630 --> 03:06:34,230
What if I'm just...

4181
03:06:34,230 --> 03:06:35,170
Wanting to murder?

4182
03:06:43,130 --> 03:06:43,910
Then it's fine.

4183
03:06:45,490 --> 03:06:46,130
Yippee!

4184
03:06:47,090 --> 03:06:48,450
He's been around forever.

4185
03:06:48,830 --> 03:06:51,350
Must be 300 years or more since he took charge.

4186
03:06:51,750 --> 03:06:53,290
I'm not sure he's even human.

4187
03:06:54,010 --> 03:06:54,650
I...

4188
03:06:54,650 --> 03:06:55,430
I mean...

4189
03:06:55,430 --> 03:06:57,410
If he's 300 years old...

4190
03:07:03,100 --> 03:07:05,560
Recreational murder is a-o-kay.

4191
03:07:05,880 --> 03:07:07,480
He's a captain of the Imperial Watch.

4192
03:07:07,860 --> 03:07:12,200
He is pursuing a personal vendetta against the Thieves Guild and the Grey Fox.

4193
03:07:12,700 --> 03:07:16,580
Two years ago, I made a fool out of him when he tried to arrest me.

4194
03:07:16,700 --> 03:07:18,180
Lex has never forgotten it.

4195
03:07:21,740 --> 03:07:22,140
Hehehehe.

4196
03:07:22,140 --> 03:07:22,160
Hehehehe.

4197
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:23,080
Have you heard about Kavaj?

4198
03:07:23,540 --> 03:07:27,240
They say that Deirdre came from Oblivion and burned the whole city to the ground.

4199
03:07:27,380 --> 03:07:27,900
Yeah, I was there.

4200
03:07:29,420 --> 03:07:31,740
The best source of information are the beggars.

4201
03:07:31,900 --> 03:07:33,780
Their eyes and ears seem to be everywhere.

4202
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:34,100
I thought it.

4203
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:35,360
However...

4204
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:36,160
I thought it would be like...

4205
03:07:36,160 --> 03:07:38,180
Sorry, you've seen that the diaries in another castle.

4206
03:07:38,460 --> 03:07:40,300
I won't tell you anything for free.

4207
03:07:40,740 --> 03:07:42,240
At least not anything true.

4208
03:07:42,720 --> 03:07:43,860
Not anything true?

4209
03:07:44,600 --> 03:07:45,160
What about...

4210
03:07:45,160 --> 03:07:45,820
Yeah, special...

4211
03:07:45,820 --> 03:07:47,000
Special jobs.

4212
03:07:47,400 --> 03:07:50,620
You need more experience before I can use you on a condition job.

4213
03:07:51,360 --> 03:07:54,060
Angar tells me that you haven't turned in much loot yet.

4214
03:07:54,240 --> 03:08:01,640
When you've contributed enough to the guild coffers by selling stolen items to Angar, I might have something for you.

4215
03:08:01,640 --> 03:08:03,640
Where do I meet Angar?

4216
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:05,580
Wait, where do I meet him?

4217
03:08:06,700 --> 03:08:08,840
We're thieves, not masons or scribes.

4218
03:08:08,880 --> 03:08:09,740
Oh, independent thievery.

4219
03:08:10,120 --> 03:08:11,340
Look, you're on your own as a thief.

4220
03:08:11,940 --> 03:08:14,000
Go find a likely looking house.

4221
03:08:14,440 --> 03:08:16,580
Pace the joint to see when the owner is gone.

4222
03:08:17,060 --> 03:08:20,140
When he leaves, you break in and steal some stuff.

4223
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:23,340
You don't need special permission or orders to do that.

4224
03:08:23,540 --> 03:08:24,020
So true.

4225
03:08:24,320 --> 03:08:28,920
However, you will find that you can only sell stolen property to one of our guild fences.

4226
03:08:28,940 --> 03:08:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4227
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,280
Most other merchants won't take hot merchandise.

4228
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:33,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4229
03:08:33,940 --> 03:08:35,800
So we all work alone?

4230
03:08:36,080 --> 03:08:38,700
Well, sometimes the guild gets a special commission.

4231
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:44,140
You know, guaranteed pay to acquire certain items for special clients.

4232
03:08:44,800 --> 03:08:49,600
You should check in with your doyen every once in a while to see if there are any commission jobs available.

4233
03:08:50,860 --> 03:08:52,200
I'd like to hear it.

4234
03:08:53,460 --> 03:08:54,900
Sorry, I'm using a blue bar.

4235
03:08:55,900 --> 03:08:56,300
Or...

4236
03:08:58,420 --> 03:08:58,820
Hmm...

4237
03:08:58,820 --> 03:08:59,220
Ok.

4238
03:09:00,800 --> 03:09:01,200
Yay!

4239
03:09:01,660 --> 03:09:03,180
Well, that lady led us right to it.

4240
03:09:03,720 --> 03:09:04,680
Shadow hide you.

4241
03:09:05,240 --> 03:09:06,960
That lady led us right to it.

4242
03:09:07,460 --> 03:09:07,860
So...

4243
03:09:07,860 --> 03:09:08,520
Um...

4244
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:10,380
Heh, heh, heh boo boo to you everybody else.

4245
03:09:13,180 --> 03:09:13,580
Oh...

4246
03:09:13,580 --> 03:09:16,360
Now that we're here...

4247
03:09:16,900 --> 03:09:18,440
Ask about the guild to learn where your fence is.

4248
03:09:18,540 --> 03:09:18,940
Oh, okay.

4249
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:19,220
Good.

4250
03:09:19,220 --> 03:09:19,620
Oh.

4251
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:21,500
Oh, puny.

4252
03:09:23,840 --> 03:09:26,500
Um, about the guild.

4253
03:09:27,360 --> 03:09:30,180
Yeah, I need to know where a fence is, so I can...

4254
03:09:30,180 --> 03:09:31,800
Oh, what if I do kill someone?

4255
03:09:44,580 --> 03:09:53,480
What if I... murder... when I'm having... just a good... what if it's just, you know...

4256
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:56,380
Cloud, welcome to membership.

4257
03:09:56,560 --> 03:09:57,120
Thank you!

4258
03:09:57,500 --> 03:09:59,400
Actually, I have a mission right now.

4259
03:09:59,500 --> 03:10:00,540
I gotta go kill somebody.

4260
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:05,100
The best fences are only available to the higher-ranked Thieves' Guild members.

4261
03:10:05,780 --> 03:10:07,620
Here's a list of who you can use.

4262
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:08,240
Hmm.

4263
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:11,200
Angar.

4264
03:10:11,460 --> 03:10:12,660
Angar lives in Bruma.

4265
03:10:12,820 --> 03:10:13,160
Okay, okay.

4266
03:10:13,160 --> 03:10:18,040
He doesn't have much money, but he's the only place you can sell hot property if you are new to the Thieves' Guild.

4267
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:18,980
Okay, I'm new.

4268
03:10:19,060 --> 03:10:19,920
I just joined tonight.

4269
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:27,020
Shadowhide you.

4270
03:10:28,680 --> 03:10:30,120
We only got that one guy.

4271
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:32,440
Okay.

4272
03:10:34,440 --> 03:10:36,380
Now, we need to go here.

4273
03:10:37,620 --> 03:10:40,020
So to quest, we're gonna do...

4274
03:10:40,760 --> 03:10:42,120
A knife in the dark.

4275
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:43,260
Wait.

4276
03:10:44,380 --> 03:10:45,220
Did that...

4277
03:10:45,680 --> 03:10:46,460
Did that do it?

4278
03:10:46,720 --> 03:10:47,300
Oh, it did.

4279
03:10:47,440 --> 03:10:47,740
Okay, good.

4280
03:10:52,870 --> 03:10:53,090
Oh.

4281
03:10:53,550 --> 03:10:54,290
Oh, it's... wait.

4282
03:10:54,610 --> 03:10:54,650
Hmm?

4283
03:10:58,410 --> 03:10:59,150
Why is it...

4284
03:11:00,050 --> 03:11:00,470
Hmm?

4285
03:11:02,070 --> 03:11:02,490
Hmm?

4286
03:11:04,210 --> 03:11:04,630
Hmm?

4287
03:11:04,630 --> 03:11:05,710
Why is it telling me to go this way?

4288
03:11:07,390 --> 03:11:10,070
I hope I made myself clear the first time.

4289
03:11:10,670 --> 03:11:13,590
If you get near that ship, you will end up dead.

4290
03:11:13,990 --> 03:11:15,290
Now get out of my face.

4291
03:11:15,290 --> 03:11:16,530
I wasn't talking to you, lady!

4292
03:11:17,390 --> 03:11:18,710
It sends you through the city.

4293
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:19,230
Oh.

4294
03:11:20,190 --> 03:11:21,530
Well, we need to go down.

4295
03:11:21,850 --> 03:11:24,130
Maybe it's telling us to go around the city.

4296
03:11:25,050 --> 03:11:26,130
That's so weird.

4297
03:11:26,910 --> 03:11:27,430
Hmm.

4298
03:11:28,210 --> 03:11:29,430
I could just swim.

4299
03:11:31,950 --> 03:11:33,070
I know how to swim.

4300
03:11:33,570 --> 03:11:34,510
We could swim the whole...

4301
03:11:34,510 --> 03:11:35,810
Oh, hey, sweet lady of Wayrest.

4302
03:11:36,030 --> 03:11:37,870
Oh, hey, sweet lady of mine.

4303
03:11:38,050 --> 03:11:38,890
I'll see you again.

4304
03:11:39,050 --> 03:11:40,030
Yes, I'll see you again.

4305
03:11:40,350 --> 03:11:41,390
Sweet lady of Wayrest.

4306
03:11:41,670 --> 03:11:42,210
So fine.

4307
03:11:48,250 --> 03:11:49,990
I hear a nerd root.

4308
03:11:51,390 --> 03:11:52,610
I hear it.

4309
03:11:53,270 --> 03:11:54,610
Wait, where are you?

4310
03:11:57,350 --> 03:11:58,530
I hear it.

4311
03:11:58,910 --> 03:11:59,470
Oh, there it is.

4312
03:12:03,550 --> 03:12:05,950
Oh, sweet lady of Wayrest.

4313
03:12:06,170 --> 03:12:07,390
Oh, sweet lady of mine.

4314
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:09,870
Did you just say nerd?

4315
03:12:10,250 --> 03:12:12,510
Oh, well, we have to abandon our horse to swim.

4316
03:12:13,070 --> 03:12:14,690
But I think it's worth it, no?

4317
03:12:15,990 --> 03:12:17,090
It's way faster.

4318
03:12:22,410 --> 03:12:24,250
It's way faster to just swim.

4319
03:12:27,870 --> 03:12:30,190
There's nowhere to fast travel this way, though.

4320
03:12:31,210 --> 03:12:32,210
Like if I swim.

4321
03:12:39,050 --> 03:12:40,810
Watch out for slaughter fish.

4322
03:12:41,150 --> 03:12:41,990
Oh, that's right.

4323
03:12:42,430 --> 03:12:43,550
There were that...

4324
03:12:43,550 --> 03:12:45,870
The first time I played, there was just that one guy.

4325
03:12:47,310 --> 03:12:48,350
That one fish.

4326
03:12:48,570 --> 03:12:49,690
But he wasn't doing anything.

4327
03:12:49,910 --> 03:12:50,610
I think they're useless.

4328
03:12:53,710 --> 03:12:54,190
Mudcrabs.

4329
03:12:54,270 --> 03:12:55,030
Those guys are annoying.

4330
03:12:55,170 --> 03:12:56,050
I hate those the most.

4331
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:02,800
Back I'll walk with my bow.

4332
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:05,500
What's this?

4333
03:13:06,700 --> 03:13:07,420
Tower stone.

4334
03:13:11,080 --> 03:13:12,780
You're marked by a special fate.

4335
03:13:12,920 --> 03:13:13,800
You rule your destiny.

4336
03:13:13,960 --> 03:13:16,220
Do you choose to steer by the stars of the tower?

4337
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:18,040
Yeah.

4338
03:13:19,320 --> 03:13:21,700
The stars of the tower shine upon you.

4339
03:13:21,920 --> 03:13:25,200
You gain the warden key and master's hand greater powers.

4340
03:13:30,510 --> 03:13:31,530
What did that do?

4341
03:13:32,670 --> 03:13:34,170
Gives you a daily spell.

4342
03:13:36,890 --> 03:13:37,890
New spells.

4343
03:13:38,150 --> 03:13:38,670
Neat.

4344
03:13:42,780 --> 03:13:43,180
Okay.

4345
03:13:43,400 --> 03:13:44,140
Now we go this way.

4346
03:13:46,420 --> 03:13:48,000
Oh, lady of mine.

4347
03:13:48,440 --> 03:13:49,120
Oh, sweet lady.

4348
03:13:49,360 --> 03:13:49,920
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

4349
03:13:50,540 --> 03:13:52,660
So sweet lady of so fine.

4350
03:14:02,110 --> 03:14:03,910
Wait, it changed my lucky stars?

4351
03:14:04,650 --> 03:14:06,730
Wait, everybody's giving me different information.

4352
03:14:06,910 --> 03:14:07,910
Does it give me a spell?

4353
03:14:08,070 --> 03:14:09,330
Or does it change my...

4354
03:14:09,330 --> 03:14:11,270
I feel like it would tell you if it changed your star.

4355
03:14:19,390 --> 03:14:20,830
It's a separate buff.

4356
03:14:21,830 --> 03:14:22,450
Okay.

4357
03:14:23,650 --> 03:14:25,050
This isn't Skyrim chat.

4358
03:14:25,170 --> 03:14:26,130
You can't change your star.

4359
03:14:26,330 --> 03:14:26,570
Oh.

4360
03:14:27,630 --> 03:14:30,090
You guys are getting confused.

4361
03:14:33,830 --> 03:14:35,690
You guys are silly.

4362
03:14:36,030 --> 03:14:36,850
You're getting confused.

4363
03:14:37,310 --> 03:14:37,930
Different game.

4364
03:14:46,050 --> 03:14:47,470
What time is it anyway?

4365
03:14:47,630 --> 03:14:47,770
Let's see.

4366
03:14:47,970 --> 03:14:48,030
Oh.

4367
03:14:48,390 --> 03:14:49,010
Enemies are nearby.

4368
03:14:55,120 --> 03:14:55,720
Where?

4369
03:14:57,240 --> 03:14:58,220
Enemy nearby.

4370
03:15:00,100 --> 03:15:00,700
Where?

4371
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:03,240
Am I being pursued by a mudcrop?

4372
03:15:07,380 --> 03:15:08,640
Oh, my sneak increase.

4373
03:15:08,820 --> 03:15:09,280
It scared me.

4374
03:15:11,720 --> 03:15:13,500
Do the deer count as enemies?

4375
03:15:14,420 --> 03:15:14,860
Because...

4376
03:15:14,860 --> 03:15:17,020
I'm starting to think that's the case.

4377
03:15:19,780 --> 03:15:20,460
There we go.

4378
03:15:20,620 --> 03:15:21,560
Okay, it's 4 a.m.

4379
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:23,880
And I guess we're...

4380
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:24,040
Whoa.

4381
03:15:24,680 --> 03:15:25,720
Wait, I'm stuck.

4382
03:15:25,960 --> 03:15:26,280
There it is.

4383
03:15:27,260 --> 03:15:29,320
That's not a door to oblivion, is it?

4384
03:15:39,070 --> 03:15:39,510
Oh.

4385
03:15:39,730 --> 03:15:40,430
Oh, come on.

4386
03:15:41,250 --> 03:15:41,690
Dog.

4387
03:15:43,570 --> 03:15:44,010
Oops.

4388
03:15:44,210 --> 03:15:44,910
I'm so stupid.

4389
03:15:48,630 --> 03:15:49,310
There we go.

4390
03:15:54,340 --> 03:15:56,500
Wait, why is there a portal to oblivion here?

4391
03:15:58,780 --> 03:16:01,000
Wait, why is it telling me to go here?

4392
03:16:01,440 --> 03:16:01,580
Huh?

4393
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:24,540
It's near the inn.

4394
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:25,520
No kidding.

4395
03:16:26,300 --> 03:16:28,240
Wait, will things come out and attack the daedra...

4396
03:16:28,240 --> 03:16:28,880
Oh, shoot.

4397
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:32,080
I answered my own question.

4398
03:16:32,520 --> 03:16:32,800
Ah!

4399
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:38,220
You caught him on fire.

4400
03:16:38,300 --> 03:16:38,820
Friendly fire.

4401
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:39,980
Friendly fire.

4402
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:45,900
Oh.

4403
03:16:46,200 --> 03:16:46,620
Oh.

4404
03:16:47,060 --> 03:16:47,480
Oh.

4405
03:16:47,820 --> 03:16:48,540
Why is it red?

4406
03:16:48,860 --> 03:16:49,680
What's happening?

4407
03:16:52,140 --> 03:16:53,280
What's going on?

4408
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:07,370
Because I'm close to the gate.

4409
03:17:07,610 --> 03:17:07,830
Oh.

4410
03:17:07,830 --> 03:17:09,970
Okay, let's, uh...

4411
03:17:09,970 --> 03:17:11,650
Let's go the long way around.

4412
03:17:13,670 --> 03:17:14,190
Um...

4413
03:17:14,190 --> 03:17:15,970
I didn't expect...

4414
03:17:15,970 --> 03:17:16,850
Oh, golly.

4415
03:17:17,130 --> 03:17:19,250
Okay, I'm just trying to murder a man.

4416
03:17:20,410 --> 03:17:21,290
Ill-o-men.

4417
03:17:21,690 --> 03:17:22,570
Where is it at?

4418
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:27,130
Oh, here it is.

4419
03:17:33,090 --> 03:17:34,850
Who am I murdering here?

4420
03:17:39,180 --> 03:17:40,020
Rufio.

4421
03:17:41,180 --> 03:17:43,300
A man named Rufio.

4422
03:17:49,270 --> 03:17:50,530
That's not our guy, is it?

4423
03:18:06,570 --> 03:18:07,410
Hello.

4424
03:18:17,940 --> 03:18:18,780
Average.

4425
03:18:19,320 --> 03:18:20,640
Wait, I'm allowed in here.

4426
03:18:28,250 --> 03:18:30,210
Wow, this is the...

4427
03:18:30,210 --> 03:18:32,250
Most dingy...

4428
03:18:32,250 --> 03:18:33,850
Inn I've ever seen, ever.

4429
03:18:38,700 --> 03:18:40,660
No wonder the inn has that name.

4430
03:18:57,820 --> 03:18:58,540
What the?

4431
03:19:00,200 --> 03:19:00,760
Um...

4432
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:03,180
There's no one by the name Rufio here.

4433
03:19:29,870 --> 03:19:31,030
Oh my god.

4434
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:37,740
Don't leave.

4435
03:19:38,060 --> 03:19:38,660
Don't do that.

4436
03:19:39,240 --> 03:19:39,880
Stop it.

4437
03:19:45,610 --> 03:19:46,090
Stop.

4438
03:19:47,090 --> 03:19:48,250
You're doing this on purpose.

4439
03:19:48,610 --> 03:19:48,850
No!

4440
03:19:53,620 --> 03:19:54,880
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

4441
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:56,180
Oh, no.

4442
03:19:56,320 --> 03:19:56,800
Who are you?

4443
03:19:56,980 --> 03:19:57,780
What do you want?

4444
03:19:58,380 --> 03:19:59,300
I ain't done nothing.

4445
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:02,360
Uh...

4446
03:20:02,360 --> 03:20:04,180
Oh, but you have, Rufio.

4447
03:20:04,520 --> 03:20:05,220
No, please.

4448
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:06,640
I didn't mean to do it.

4449
03:20:06,700 --> 03:20:07,360
You understand me?

4450
03:20:07,540 --> 03:20:08,320
She struggled.

4451
03:20:08,640 --> 03:20:09,120
I...

4452
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:12,040
I told her to just stay still, but she wouldn't listen.

4453
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:13,580
I had no choice.

4454
03:20:14,620 --> 03:20:15,180
What...

4455
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:16,180
What did you do?

4456
03:20:18,960 --> 03:20:19,520
Stop...

4457
03:20:19,520 --> 03:20:20,660
Stop moving so fast!

4458
03:20:21,020 --> 03:20:21,700
Stop it!

4459
03:20:22,320 --> 03:20:22,880
Stop...

4460
03:20:22,880 --> 03:20:24,500
Stop moving so fast!

4461
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:25,360
Rufio!

4462
03:20:26,120 --> 03:20:26,680
Rufio!

4463
03:20:29,500 --> 03:20:32,160
The next time I sleep in a location he deems secure...

4464
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:33,480
He will visit me once again.

4465
03:20:36,980 --> 03:20:38,800
Well, thanks for unlocking this for me.

4466
03:20:46,260 --> 03:20:47,960
Why was he...

4467
03:20:47,960 --> 03:20:50,940
Why was he dancing around so crazy, like?

4468
03:20:51,480 --> 03:20:52,100
What...

4469
03:20:52,100 --> 03:20:52,940
What did he do?

4470
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:54,320
Rufio!

4471
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:56,460
Maybe...

4472
03:20:56,460 --> 03:20:57,500
You really did deserve that.

4473
03:20:58,960 --> 03:21:01,220
I think he actually deserved that...

4474
03:21:01,220 --> 03:21:01,800
A lot.

4475
03:21:05,200 --> 03:21:06,200
I'm just looking.

4476
03:21:13,040 --> 03:21:14,120
Dead to you.

4477
03:21:14,320 --> 03:21:15,200
Boo-boo, Rufio.

4478
03:21:16,820 --> 03:21:19,060
He's not gonna be mad at me when I come up here, right?

4479
03:21:19,980 --> 03:21:20,520
Oh, golly.

4480
03:21:21,180 --> 03:21:21,340
Wait.

4481
03:21:21,620 --> 03:21:21,920
Open?

4482
03:21:22,920 --> 03:21:23,440
Open.

4483
03:21:24,220 --> 03:21:24,960
There we go.

4484
03:21:27,620 --> 03:21:29,620
Stop right there, criminal scum.

4485
03:21:29,620 --> 03:21:32,540
Nobody breaks the law on my watch.

4486
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:34,980
I'm confiscating your stolen goods.

4487
03:21:35,180 --> 03:21:35,620
I didn't!

4488
03:21:35,820 --> 03:21:37,400
Now pay your fine or it's off to jail.

4489
03:21:37,460 --> 03:21:37,820
No!

4490
03:21:38,240 --> 03:21:39,260
How much is it?

4491
03:21:39,940 --> 03:21:41,120
That's only 25.

4492
03:21:46,970 --> 03:21:47,570
Wait.

4493
03:21:50,250 --> 03:21:52,250
He caught you pickpocketing.

4494
03:21:53,850 --> 03:21:54,850
No way.

4495
03:21:55,450 --> 03:21:57,310
They don't even care that I murdered him.

4496
03:22:01,010 --> 03:22:02,670
I feel like I should reload.

4497
03:22:03,310 --> 03:22:03,790
Honestly.

4498
03:22:09,330 --> 03:22:10,430
I think I'm gonna...

4499
03:22:10,430 --> 03:22:10,950
Okay, hold on.

4500
03:22:11,050 --> 03:22:11,710
I'm gonna reload.

4501
03:22:12,070 --> 03:22:12,870
That's too bad.

4502
03:22:12,910 --> 03:22:14,570
I didn't even mean to pickpocket him.

4503
03:22:14,810 --> 03:22:15,350
I was hoping you'd resist arrest.

4504
03:22:15,570 --> 03:22:15,930
Okay.

4505
03:22:16,130 --> 03:22:17,310
I didn't even think...

4506
03:22:17,310 --> 03:22:17,650
Ugh!

4507
03:22:18,210 --> 03:22:19,370
I didn't even think I was...

4508
03:22:19,370 --> 03:22:20,170
I'm gonna reload.

4509
03:22:21,850 --> 03:22:22,330
Ugh!

4510
03:22:29,280 --> 03:22:29,760
Um...

4511
03:22:29,760 --> 03:22:31,580
It was an auto-save.

4512
03:22:31,860 --> 03:22:32,620
This one, yes.

4513
03:22:32,900 --> 03:22:33,180
Okay.

4514
03:22:36,370 --> 03:22:37,990
I was like, wait a second.

4515
03:22:39,370 --> 03:22:41,370
Wait, use the blade this time.

4516
03:22:42,610 --> 03:22:43,090
Why?

4517
03:22:53,580 --> 03:22:55,440
Oh, you're doing it with the blade.

4518
03:22:55,700 --> 03:22:57,280
The Brotherhood gives you bonuses.

4519
03:22:57,620 --> 03:22:58,140
Oh, okay.

4520
03:22:58,800 --> 03:22:59,220
Good to know.

4521
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:16,380
Who are you?

4522
03:23:16,620 --> 03:23:17,380
What do you want?

4523
03:23:17,820 --> 03:23:18,880
I ain't done nothing.

4524
03:23:19,320 --> 03:23:20,000
I ain't done nothing.

4525
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:21,820
Oh, but wait.

4526
03:23:22,900 --> 03:23:24,840
No one hides from Sithis.

4527
03:23:25,080 --> 03:23:25,880
Oh, please, no.

4528
03:23:26,280 --> 03:23:27,360
I can pay you.

4529
03:23:27,560 --> 03:23:28,200
Name your price.

4530
03:23:28,400 --> 03:23:28,680
Anything.

4531
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:29,720
Anything.

4532
03:23:30,160 --> 03:23:31,640
Please, just let me live.

4533
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:32,740
He doesn't sound very convincing.

4534
03:23:32,920 --> 03:23:32,940
Oh!

4535
03:23:40,580 --> 03:23:41,020
Wee!

4536
03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:44,160
He didn't even yell.

4537
03:23:45,020 --> 03:23:45,960
Good job, Rufio.

4538
03:23:47,280 --> 03:23:49,560
Good job dying so quietly.

4539
03:23:52,440 --> 03:23:53,480
I can sleep here?

4540
03:23:53,580 --> 03:23:54,860
Is this place deemed...

4541
03:23:54,860 --> 03:23:56,360
Oh, was there anything in here?

4542
03:23:56,460 --> 03:23:57,280
I don't think so, no.

4543
03:24:00,660 --> 03:24:02,320
I don't think there was anything worth it in here.

4544
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:07,120
That was so easy.

4545
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:19,220
Try this bed.

4546
03:24:19,660 --> 03:24:20,000
This one?

4547
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:22,400
Free bed.

4548
03:24:22,740 --> 03:24:23,800
Yeah, let's use it.

4549
03:24:24,160 --> 03:24:25,040
Wait, I'm gonna save.

4550
03:24:28,540 --> 03:24:30,420
I'm gonna sleep for...

4551
03:24:30,420 --> 03:24:31,180
Two hours.

4552
03:24:31,340 --> 03:24:32,460
Just a little nap, you know.

4553
03:24:33,680 --> 03:24:35,160
I sense a presence nearby.

4554
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:38,140
So, the deed is done.

4555
03:24:38,520 --> 03:24:39,400
Yeah, he's right behind you.

4556
03:24:39,560 --> 03:24:40,140
How do I know this?

4557
03:24:40,480 --> 03:24:44,000
You'll find that the Dark Brotherhood knows a great many things.

4558
03:24:44,180 --> 03:24:47,100
For you are now part of the family.

4559
03:24:49,980 --> 03:24:52,260
My life for the Brotherhood!

4560
03:24:52,420 --> 03:24:52,940
Indeed.

4561
03:24:53,540 --> 03:24:56,920
For the slaying of Rufio was the signing of a covenant.

4562
03:24:57,280 --> 03:25:00,660
The manner of execution, your signature.

4563
03:25:01,660 --> 03:25:02,800
Rufio's blood.

4564
03:25:03,560 --> 03:25:04,280
The ink.

4565
03:25:04,540 --> 03:25:05,080
Nice.

4566
03:25:05,200 --> 03:25:11,000
As a speaker of the Black Hand, I directly oversee a particular group of family members.

4567
03:25:11,480 --> 03:25:16,020
You will join that group and fulfill any contracts given.

4568
03:25:16,020 --> 03:25:17,240
Let's go.

4569
03:25:17,240 --> 03:25:20,520
You must now go to the city of Chaitin Hall.

4570
03:25:20,980 --> 03:25:24,460
To the abandoned house near the eastern wall.

4571
03:25:25,380 --> 03:25:30,600
Enter the basement and attempt to open the black door.

4572
03:25:31,100 --> 03:25:31,380
Okay.

4573
03:25:31,720 --> 03:25:32,920
You will be asked a question.

4574
03:25:33,520 --> 03:25:35,300
Answer thusly.

4575
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:37,520
Sanguine, my brother.

4576
03:25:37,760 --> 03:25:38,920
Sanguine, my brother.

4577
03:25:39,080 --> 03:25:40,240
You will gain entrance to the sanctuary.

4578
03:25:40,600 --> 03:25:43,980
Once inside, speak with Ochiva.

4579
03:25:44,160 --> 03:25:44,820
Ochiva.

4580
03:25:44,820 --> 03:25:46,980
We must now take our leave of each other.

4581
03:25:47,160 --> 03:25:49,000
You and I.

4582
03:25:49,340 --> 03:25:52,180
For there is much work to be done.

4583
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:56,060
I'll be following your progress.

4584
03:25:57,780 --> 03:25:59,800
Welcome to the family.

4585
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:04,100
What did Rufio do?

4586
03:26:04,320 --> 03:26:05,820
Rufio lies dead.

4587
03:26:06,660 --> 03:26:07,600
Well done.

4588
03:26:08,240 --> 03:26:12,320
The family will now welcome you with open arms.

4589
03:26:12,820 --> 03:26:13,040
Okay.

4590
03:26:14,200 --> 03:26:14,740
Covenant.

4591
03:26:15,840 --> 03:26:16,780
Know this.

4592
03:26:17,140 --> 03:26:21,000
Every dark brother and sister is a child of Sithis.

4593
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:23,480
He whom we call Sithis...

4594
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:24,140
Yeah, Sithis!

4595
03:26:24,140 --> 03:26:25,020
Many other names.

4596
03:26:25,420 --> 03:26:28,020
Chaos, doom, discord.

4597
03:26:28,500 --> 03:26:30,680
Sithis is the void.

4598
03:26:30,900 --> 03:26:31,720
Yeah, Sithis!

4599
03:26:31,780 --> 03:26:35,100
We of the Dark Brotherhood serve the Night Mother.

4600
03:26:35,220 --> 03:26:35,960
A happy Mother's Day?

4601
03:26:36,160 --> 03:26:37,300
Who is the bride of Sithis.

4602
03:26:37,660 --> 03:26:42,160
The Night Mother rules her children with a terrible black hand.

4603
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:46,320
The black hand is the ruling body of the Dark Brotherhood.

4604
03:26:46,320 --> 03:26:49,420
It is made up of one listener and four speakers.

4605
03:26:49,820 --> 03:26:52,440
Four fingers and a thumb, if you will.

4606
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:54,260
Oh yeah, that's a hand.

4607
03:26:54,500 --> 03:26:57,280
As a member of the Dark Brotherhood, you must abide by the Five Tenants.

4608
03:26:57,640 --> 03:26:59,060
They are the laws that guide and protect us.

4609
03:26:59,060 --> 03:27:00,040
This guy is yapping.

4610
03:27:00,400 --> 03:27:00,960
Holy cow.

4611
03:27:02,240 --> 03:27:03,400
What's the Five Tenants?

4612
03:27:03,620 --> 03:27:06,300
The Five Tenants are as follows.

4613
03:27:06,600 --> 03:27:06,640
Okay.

4614
03:27:07,220 --> 03:27:08,280
Tenant One.

4615
03:27:09,260 --> 03:27:11,480
Never dishonor the Night Mother.

4616
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:11,980
Okay.

4617
03:27:12,260 --> 03:27:16,200
To do so is to invoke the wrath of Sithis.

4618
03:27:17,020 --> 03:27:18,080
Tenant Two.

4619
03:27:18,800 --> 03:27:22,440
Never betray the Dark Brotherhood or its secrets.

4620
03:27:22,440 --> 03:27:23,640
Sometimes he has an accent.

4621
03:27:23,860 --> 03:27:26,440
To do so is to invoke the wrath of Sithis.

4622
03:27:26,580 --> 03:27:26,800
Okay.

4623
03:27:27,400 --> 03:27:28,460
Tenant Three.

4624
03:27:29,480 --> 03:27:35,480
Never disobey or refuse to carry out an order from a Dark Brotherhood superior.

4625
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:40,100
To do so is to invoke the wrath of Sithis.

4626
03:27:40,660 --> 03:27:42,720
Is my OTP a joke to you?

4627
03:27:42,720 --> 03:27:46,300
Never steal the possessions of a Dark Brother or Dark Brother.

4628
03:27:47,620 --> 03:27:52,000
To do so is to invoke the wrath of Sithis.

4629
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:54,020
How do I know if they're a Dark Brother or Sister?

4630
03:27:54,360 --> 03:27:54,420
Tenant Five.

4631
03:27:55,740 --> 03:27:59,560
Never kill a Dark Brother or Dark Sister.

4632
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:00,940
To do so...

4633
03:28:00,940 --> 03:28:01,560
Sorry, it's funny.

4634
03:28:01,560 --> 03:28:05,020
Is to invoke the wrath of Sithis.

4635
03:28:06,900 --> 03:28:08,000
For those...

4636
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:08,420
So, okay.

4637
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:09,400
So, basically...

4638
03:28:10,140 --> 03:28:11,420
In Fruits Basket...

4639
03:28:12,280 --> 03:28:13,240
The...

4640
03:28:13,240 --> 03:28:14,560
The show...

4641
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:18,280
I really liked Yuki and Tohru together.

4642
03:28:19,020 --> 03:28:20,180
And I was just like...

4643
03:28:20,180 --> 03:28:21,840
Oh, but you know...

4644
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:22,440
Like...

4645
03:28:22,440 --> 03:28:23,060
Rather...

4646
03:28:23,060 --> 03:28:23,580
Or rather...

4647
03:28:23,580 --> 03:28:24,700
I used to like...

4648
03:28:24,700 --> 03:28:26,060
I used to like...

4649
03:28:26,060 --> 03:28:27,040
Kyo and...

4650
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:27,980
Wait...

4651
03:28:27,980 --> 03:28:28,260
Tohru...

4652
03:28:28,260 --> 03:28:29,460
Kyo and Tohru together.

4653
03:28:30,240 --> 03:28:30,840
But then...

4654
03:28:30,840 --> 03:28:31,680
I...

4655
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:32,640
When I...

4656
03:28:32,640 --> 03:28:34,680
When I re-watched it...

4657
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:35,080
I was like...

4658
03:28:35,080 --> 03:28:35,420
Oh, man.

4659
03:28:35,480 --> 03:28:36,780
I really like Yuki, actually.

4660
03:28:37,080 --> 03:28:38,360
But I know he's like...

4661
03:28:38,360 --> 03:28:39,760
The second lead.

4662
03:28:40,100 --> 03:28:40,480
So...

4663
03:28:40,480 --> 03:28:43,160
The second lead never gets with the person.

4664
03:28:43,160 --> 03:28:43,580
You know?

4665
03:28:43,720 --> 03:28:44,720
Like, it's never...

4666
03:28:44,720 --> 03:28:46,260
It never works out.

4667
03:28:46,260 --> 03:28:48,840
But rather than getting friend-zoned...

4668
03:28:49,340 --> 03:28:51,440
You know what happens with my second lead?

4669
03:28:52,220 --> 03:28:52,780
Yuki...

4670
03:28:52,780 --> 03:28:53,940
In Fruits Basket.

4671
03:28:54,060 --> 03:28:55,020
You know what happens to him?

4672
03:28:55,140 --> 03:28:56,100
He's just like...

4673
03:28:56,100 --> 03:28:56,580
Oh, yeah.

4674
03:28:56,980 --> 03:28:57,620
You know what?

4675
03:28:57,620 --> 03:28:58,560
I discovered something.

4676
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,340
I don't just love Tohru Honda...

4677
03:29:01,340 --> 03:29:02,160
As a woman.

4678
03:29:02,340 --> 03:29:03,800
I love her as a mother.

4679
03:29:04,160 --> 03:29:05,820
And getting mother-zoned...

4680
03:29:05,820 --> 03:29:07,880
Might be the worst thing to ever happen.

4681
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:08,800
I'm just...

4682
03:29:12,760 --> 03:29:15,460
You couldn't even just let him down lightly...

4683
03:29:15,460 --> 03:29:16,580
And let him move on.

4684
03:29:16,720 --> 03:29:17,440
No, no, no.

4685
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:19,300
You had to have my...

4686
03:29:19,300 --> 03:29:20,960
My man was so perfect.

4687
03:29:21,860 --> 03:29:23,080
My man was so perfect.

4688
03:29:23,100 --> 03:29:24,040
She would have picked him.

4689
03:29:24,400 --> 03:29:25,320
Probably not, actually.

4690
03:29:25,660 --> 03:29:26,060
But...

4691
03:29:26,060 --> 03:29:27,220
She was so perfect.

4692
03:29:27,680 --> 03:29:28,200
He was...

4693
03:29:28,200 --> 03:29:29,400
Or rather, he was so perfect...

4694
03:29:29,400 --> 03:29:31,300
That they had to give the whole ass excuse...

4695
03:29:31,300 --> 03:29:33,720
That he mother-zoned her...

4696
03:29:33,720 --> 03:29:34,360
So that...

4697
03:29:51,440 --> 03:29:53,780
I feel like we had this conversation before.

4698
03:29:53,960 --> 03:29:54,520
We have...

4699
03:29:54,520 --> 03:29:56,280
I was explaining it for people...

4700
03:29:56,280 --> 03:29:57,760
Who didn't understand...

4701
03:29:57,760 --> 03:29:58,540
Why...

4702
03:29:58,540 --> 03:30:00,960
I love you like a mother triggers me.

4703
03:30:03,460 --> 03:30:04,580
Dear sister...

4704
03:30:04,580 --> 03:30:05,880
I do not spread rumors.

4705
03:30:06,160 --> 03:30:07,280
I create them.

4706
03:30:07,880 --> 03:30:08,160
Wait.

4707
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:09,060
Oh, okay.

4708
03:30:09,140 --> 03:30:09,800
I was gonna say...

4709
03:30:09,800 --> 03:30:10,280
That was...

4710
03:30:10,280 --> 03:30:11,140
That was still...

4711
03:30:11,140 --> 03:30:12,140
Like, lit up before.

4712
03:30:12,600 --> 03:30:13,220
Or lit up.

4713
03:30:13,280 --> 03:30:14,840
But I remember asking that before.

4714
03:30:15,380 --> 03:30:17,060
How does one best describe...

4715
03:30:17,840 --> 03:30:18,960
Our dread father?

4716
03:30:20,680 --> 03:30:22,380
Imagine a perfect...

4717
03:30:22,380 --> 03:30:23,580
Cloudless midnight...

4718
03:30:23,580 --> 03:30:23,980
She's like a...

4719
03:30:23,980 --> 03:30:25,620
She was like a mother to be naked...

4720
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:26,300
Yuki Soba.

4721
03:30:26,460 --> 03:30:26,580
Cold as winterized...

4722
03:30:26,580 --> 03:30:27,560
Shrouding shadow.

4723
03:30:28,900 --> 03:30:29,420
That...

4724
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:30,520
Is...

4725
03:30:30,520 --> 03:30:31,500
Sithis.

4726
03:30:33,420 --> 03:30:34,400
It was like...

4727
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:35,120
And it was like...

4728
03:30:35,120 --> 03:30:36,980
In the most dramatic scene too...

4729
03:30:36,980 --> 03:30:37,400
Possible.

4730
03:30:37,800 --> 03:30:38,880
When it happened...

4731
03:30:38,880 --> 03:30:39,480
I was like...

4732
03:30:39,480 --> 03:30:40,160
This is...

4733
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:40,660
Like...

4734
03:30:40,660 --> 03:30:41,720
Like there was just this...

4735
03:30:41,720 --> 03:30:42,520
Rush of...

4736
03:30:42,520 --> 03:30:43,220
He was just like...

4737
03:30:43,220 --> 03:30:44,700
She's like my mom.

4738
03:30:45,320 --> 03:30:45,900
And I was like...

4739
03:30:45,900 --> 03:30:47,060
You are now one...

4740
03:30:47,060 --> 03:30:48,440
With the Dark Brotherhood.

4741
03:30:48,740 --> 03:30:50,200
Visit Ochiva...

4742
03:30:50,200 --> 03:30:52,320
At the Chatham Hall Sanctuary...

4743
03:30:52,320 --> 03:30:52,920
And your...

4744
03:30:52,920 --> 03:30:54,240
New life...

4745
03:30:54,240 --> 03:30:54,880
Will begin.

4746
03:30:55,140 --> 03:30:57,700
Ochiva, Ochiva, Ochiva, Ochiva, Ochiva, Ochiva...

4747
03:30:57,700 --> 03:30:59,500
Okay, I'm following you out.

4748
03:30:59,660 --> 03:30:59,700
Oh.

4749
03:31:02,860 --> 03:31:04,440
When do I get...

4750
03:31:04,440 --> 03:31:04,820
That...

4751
03:31:04,820 --> 03:31:05,080
This?

4752
03:31:05,260 --> 03:31:06,780
When do I get the stealth camo?

4753
03:31:08,660 --> 03:31:09,940
When do I get this?

4754
03:31:13,580 --> 03:31:14,980
Ochiva, Ochiva, Ochiva...

4755
03:31:14,980 --> 03:31:15,420
Ochiva...

4756
03:31:17,380 --> 03:31:18,220
He's gone.

4757
03:31:19,480 --> 03:31:20,220
I'm so...

4758
03:31:20,220 --> 03:31:22,280
Well, I'll be a spotted snowbear.

4759
03:31:22,520 --> 03:31:23,320
A customer.

4760
03:31:24,760 --> 03:31:26,120
Yeah, I still got rooms.

4761
03:31:26,340 --> 03:31:27,020
What do you need?

4762
03:31:27,220 --> 03:31:27,940
A customer.

4763
03:31:30,680 --> 03:31:31,160
Rufio?

4764
03:31:32,060 --> 03:31:33,460
He's an old codger.

4765
03:31:33,960 --> 03:31:35,680
Been living here for a couple of weeks now.

4766
03:31:36,060 --> 03:31:38,640
If you ask me, he's hiding from something.

4767
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:40,420
But what do I care?

4768
03:31:40,820 --> 03:31:41,880
He pays his tab.

4769
03:31:42,220 --> 03:31:43,360
Oh, I'm so sorry.

4770
03:31:43,460 --> 03:31:44,440
His room is downstairs.

4771
03:31:44,440 --> 03:31:46,340
In what I like to call...

4772
03:31:46,340 --> 03:31:47,240
The private quarters.

4773
03:31:47,500 --> 03:31:48,320
Why do you call it that?

4774
03:31:48,340 --> 03:31:50,320
Use that hatch in the floor over there.

4775
03:31:51,060 --> 03:31:53,000
But don't expect a warm reception.

4776
03:31:53,200 --> 03:31:54,160
It means OG sign.

4777
03:31:54,360 --> 03:31:54,500
Oh.

4778
03:31:55,740 --> 03:32:03,020
Way shrines of Arcade confer blessings of health on those who please the nine by righteous acts.

4779
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:04,400
Okay.

4780
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:06,320
Bye-bye.

4781
03:32:06,580 --> 03:32:08,320
Farewell, and tell your friends...

4782
03:32:08,320 --> 03:32:09,180
The...

4783
03:32:12,600 --> 03:32:16,340
I love mint as a boss of an army of men.

4784
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:20,680
Oh.

4785
03:32:24,930 --> 03:32:25,310
Pleasant...

4786
03:32:26,130 --> 03:32:27,850
Pleasant weather we're having.

4787
03:32:35,050 --> 03:32:35,650
Okay.

4788
03:32:41,430 --> 03:32:42,030
Goodbye.

4789
03:32:42,530 --> 03:32:42,910
Goodbye.

4790
03:32:42,910 --> 03:32:43,050
Goodbye.

4791
03:32:43,050 --> 03:32:44,970
Goodbye, portal of oblivion for right now.

4792
03:32:46,290 --> 03:32:47,590
Let's check our map.

4793
03:32:50,170 --> 03:32:52,850
So we need to go to Ochilva.

4794
03:32:54,270 --> 03:32:56,230
He said it was on the bottom...

4795
03:32:57,370 --> 03:32:58,710
Right of the map?

4796
03:32:58,830 --> 03:32:58,930
No?

4797
03:33:00,210 --> 03:33:00,770
Ochilva.

4798
03:33:02,750 --> 03:33:03,310
Ochilva.

4799
03:33:04,950 --> 03:33:05,510
East?

4800
03:33:11,730 --> 03:33:12,290
North?

4801
03:33:13,150 --> 03:33:13,710
Northeast?

4802
03:33:14,170 --> 03:33:15,850
I thought he said it was the bottom.

4803
03:33:20,180 --> 03:33:21,340
Oh, I'm west.

4804
03:33:21,340 --> 03:33:22,060
I'm an idiot.

4805
03:33:22,540 --> 03:33:22,680
Wait.

4806
03:33:23,140 --> 03:33:23,700
Ochilva.

4807
03:33:23,920 --> 03:33:24,100
Wait.

4808
03:33:24,140 --> 03:33:24,580
Is this it?

4809
03:33:24,860 --> 03:33:25,160
No.

4810
03:33:28,560 --> 03:33:29,720
Your other...

4811
03:33:29,720 --> 03:33:31,140
I thought you said waste.

4812
03:33:33,660 --> 03:33:34,300
Okay.

4813
03:33:34,940 --> 03:33:36,240
Um, what I'm gonna do...

4814
03:33:39,780 --> 03:33:41,180
Is, uh...

4815
03:33:41,180 --> 03:33:44,420
Maybe we can fast travel to...

4816
03:33:48,260 --> 03:33:48,900
Like...

4817
03:33:48,900 --> 03:33:50,460
Fort Eurasek.

4818
03:33:52,100 --> 03:33:53,680
Because I feel like I've...

4819
03:33:53,680 --> 03:33:55,140
Well, maybe I haven't traveled all over.

4820
03:33:56,200 --> 03:33:57,380
I'm gonna travel...

4821
03:33:57,380 --> 03:33:57,580
No.

4822
03:33:57,800 --> 03:33:58,760
I'm not gonna travel to the prison.

4823
03:33:58,880 --> 03:34:00,120
I think that's bad luck.

4824
03:34:02,740 --> 03:34:03,580
I'm gonna...

4825
03:34:05,400 --> 03:34:07,260
Nah, I'll travel to the Fort Eurasek.

4826
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:11,660
Yeah, yeah.

4827
03:34:12,260 --> 03:34:12,840
That's fine.

4828
03:34:14,680 --> 03:34:16,320
Yeah, been there if I have a marker like that.

4829
03:34:17,060 --> 03:34:17,140
Oh.

4830
03:34:17,660 --> 03:34:18,560
Hello, goblin.

4831
03:34:18,820 --> 03:34:19,860
Oh, that's the wrong weapon.

4832
03:34:25,140 --> 03:34:26,080
Wait, I've been...

4833
03:34:26,080 --> 03:34:27,000
I need to use my...

4834
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:27,560
Oh, wait.

4835
03:34:27,680 --> 03:34:27,780
No.

4836
03:34:27,920 --> 03:34:28,600
Both of them are fine.

4837
03:34:31,120 --> 03:34:31,500
Oh.

4838
03:34:32,160 --> 03:34:33,400
Did you see that ghosting?

4839
03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:34,340
That's crazy.

4840
03:34:41,960 --> 03:34:42,940
Where's my horse?

4841
03:34:44,060 --> 03:34:44,800
A horse?

4842
03:34:46,280 --> 03:34:46,980
That's not my horse.

4843
03:34:46,980 --> 03:34:48,140
I was about to say horse.

4844
03:34:48,640 --> 03:34:49,720
That's not my horse.

4845
03:34:50,420 --> 03:34:51,840
Wait, where's my horse?

4846
03:34:55,160 --> 03:34:56,800
What race is Eetina?

4847
03:34:56,980 --> 03:34:59,560
Eetina is a wood elf.

4848
03:35:01,060 --> 03:35:02,220
Wait, where's my horse?

4849
03:35:02,720 --> 03:35:05,020
You guys said my horse would fast travel with me.

4850
03:35:14,480 --> 03:35:19,320
I was told that no matter where I traveled, if I fast traveled, my horse would be there.

4851
03:35:21,500 --> 03:35:23,060
Only certain areas.

4852
03:35:24,280 --> 03:35:26,780
Oh, we're changing the rules, aren't we, huh?

4853
03:35:27,380 --> 03:35:28,060
That's fine.

4854
03:35:28,220 --> 03:35:28,760
We can run.

4855
03:35:33,440 --> 03:35:36,340
We are fighting dreamers.

4856
03:35:38,760 --> 03:35:39,880
Fighting dreamers.

4857
03:35:40,260 --> 03:35:41,740
Oh, my God.

4858
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:43,380
It's a fight you can't.

4859
03:35:43,420 --> 03:35:45,140
No, I was just singing a song.

4860
03:35:45,320 --> 03:35:45,560
Please.

4861
03:35:48,200 --> 03:35:49,480
I don't want to fight.

4862
03:35:50,260 --> 03:35:50,880
Oh, gosh.

4863
03:35:58,780 --> 03:35:59,500
Oh, my gosh.

4864
03:35:59,640 --> 03:35:59,820
Please.

4865
03:36:01,320 --> 03:36:01,780
Please.

4866
03:36:04,700 --> 03:36:06,240
How does he have so much...

4867
03:36:06,240 --> 03:36:07,320
Oh, my God.

4868
03:36:11,980 --> 03:36:12,820
Holy cow.

4869
03:36:16,960 --> 03:36:19,140
I was singing Fighting Dreamers.

4870
03:36:19,280 --> 03:36:22,800
And then when I come up on him, he's like, if it's a fight, you want.

4871
03:36:25,260 --> 03:36:26,980
I'm so angry right now.

4872
03:36:28,980 --> 03:36:30,040
Oh, I think...

4873
03:36:30,040 --> 03:36:31,980
Oh, I forgot that I wasn't in first person.

4874
03:36:32,220 --> 03:36:35,080
So, I probably threw off my bow a little bit.

4875
03:36:35,080 --> 03:36:35,480
Okay.

4876
03:36:35,700 --> 03:36:36,960
We lost all those arrows.

4877
03:36:37,160 --> 03:36:37,520
That's fine.

4878
03:36:38,620 --> 03:36:39,360
He obliged.

4879
03:36:39,720 --> 03:36:40,360
Yeah, exactly.

4880
03:36:41,020 --> 03:36:42,980
I think I just keep following this road.

4881
03:36:43,260 --> 03:36:45,540
It'll be a bit of a journey, but we got time.

4882
03:36:46,800 --> 03:36:49,800
Oh, chiva, oh, chiva, oh, chiva.

4883
03:36:50,520 --> 03:36:52,380
We're heading to...

4884
03:36:52,940 --> 03:36:53,560
Oh, chiva.

4885
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:00,520
Oh, chiva.

4886
03:37:02,800 --> 03:37:04,520
This looks lovely.

4887
03:37:04,900 --> 03:37:07,460
You got little flowers here and a little entrance.

4888
03:37:08,120 --> 03:37:09,920
And my future home.

4889
03:37:11,120 --> 03:37:12,860
Up there on the...

4890
03:37:12,860 --> 03:37:14,380
On the hilly hilltop.

4891
03:37:14,380 --> 03:37:16,080
I want to go to there.

4892
03:37:20,940 --> 03:37:22,100
Roland's cabin.

4893
03:37:23,160 --> 03:37:23,780
Wow.

4894
03:37:25,880 --> 03:37:26,500
Oh.

4895
03:37:26,840 --> 03:37:28,340
Um, am I not allowed in?

4896
03:37:32,780 --> 03:37:33,900
I'm not a...

4897
03:37:33,900 --> 03:37:34,700
I'm not a...

4898
03:37:34,700 --> 03:37:36,540
I'm not a petty thief.

4899
03:37:36,820 --> 03:37:38,240
I'm a legit thief.

4900
03:37:39,780 --> 03:37:43,340
They released a 20th anniversary version of that song last year.

4901
03:37:54,380 --> 03:37:56,380
Guys, I'm a genius at this...

4902
03:37:56,380 --> 03:37:57,540
No, I did it again!

4903
03:37:57,800 --> 03:37:58,180
No!

4904
03:38:35,730 --> 03:38:36,310
No!

4905
03:38:36,670 --> 03:38:38,950
I don't know why I keep saying lick.

4906
03:38:40,290 --> 03:38:45,550
I just want to say lockpick.

4907
03:38:51,980 --> 03:38:54,640
I'm just trying to say lockpicky.

4908
03:38:57,700 --> 03:38:58,880
Oh my gosh.

4909
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:01,340
John, thank you so much for the 50th.

4910
03:39:01,640 --> 03:39:02,640
Thank you.

4911
03:39:02,640 --> 03:39:04,060
Oh my goodness.

4912
03:39:05,200 --> 03:39:07,700
I can't stop saying it.

4913
03:39:08,100 --> 03:39:08,560
Hello.

4914
03:39:11,580 --> 03:39:13,720
I'm the hero of Kvatch.

4915
03:39:13,780 --> 03:39:15,580
You watch your tongue.

4916
03:39:21,560 --> 03:39:22,080
Um...

4917
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:25,960
I'm so angry at myself.

4918
03:39:31,030 --> 03:39:32,710
Why can't I speak properly?

4919
03:39:37,490 --> 03:39:39,130
I don't know why I can't...

4920
03:39:39,130 --> 03:39:40,210
Oh, there's a little imp.

4921
03:39:47,420 --> 03:39:48,540
I think I can get him.

4922
03:39:53,220 --> 03:39:53,820
Got him!

4923
03:39:54,700 --> 03:39:55,100
Oops.

4924
03:39:55,300 --> 03:39:56,760
I should have crouched for the bonus.

4925
03:39:57,420 --> 03:39:57,760
Uh-oh.

4926
03:39:58,200 --> 03:39:59,140
Uh, here he comes.

4927
03:40:00,420 --> 03:40:00,820
Shoot.

4928
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:03,440
Oh, shoot.

4929
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:04,000
Oh!

4930
03:40:04,280 --> 03:40:05,240
Oh, he's right in front of me.

4931
03:40:11,210 --> 03:40:12,570
Oh, lordy coming.

4932
03:40:15,830 --> 03:40:18,630
I should have crouched for the sneak furnace.

4933
03:40:20,370 --> 03:40:21,710
But I told you I'd get him.

4934
03:40:24,170 --> 03:40:25,230
Oh, my gosh.

4935
03:40:25,370 --> 03:40:26,330
Arrow to the knee.

4936
03:40:26,930 --> 03:40:28,450
That's from Skyrim.

4937
03:40:28,610 --> 03:40:28,730
No.

4938
03:40:29,510 --> 03:40:30,890
Isn't that a Skyrim joke?

4939
03:40:32,810 --> 03:40:34,050
Baron Cave.

4940
03:40:34,570 --> 03:40:35,210
Discovered.

4941
03:40:36,270 --> 03:40:36,630
Yeah!

4942
03:40:38,750 --> 03:40:40,330
I used to be...

4943
03:40:40,990 --> 03:40:43,490
I used to be...

4944
03:40:43,490 --> 03:40:45,450
And then I took an arrow to the knee.

4945
03:40:47,610 --> 03:40:48,250
Wow.

4946
03:40:49,050 --> 03:40:49,490
Oh, my gosh.

4947
03:40:49,490 --> 03:40:50,130
Gorgeous.

4948
03:40:52,510 --> 03:40:53,510
Baron Cave.

4949
03:40:53,630 --> 03:40:53,750
No.

4950
03:40:53,950 --> 03:40:54,730
I want to join my...

4951
03:40:54,730 --> 03:40:56,190
My fellow brothers and sisters.

4952
03:40:56,710 --> 03:40:57,370
Oops.

4953
03:41:03,220 --> 03:41:04,540
Am I on the right path?

4954
03:41:05,160 --> 03:41:05,660
Yes.

4955
03:41:07,280 --> 03:41:07,940
Oof!

4956
03:41:10,320 --> 03:41:10,980
Oof!

4957
03:41:11,960 --> 03:41:12,620
Roblox.

4958
03:41:12,800 --> 03:41:12,960
Oof.

4959
03:41:15,400 --> 03:41:16,500
One second.

4960
03:41:17,900 --> 03:41:18,780
Ducky ducky.

4961
03:41:22,790 --> 03:41:24,010
I see a bandit.

4962
03:41:24,110 --> 03:41:24,770
I see two bandits.

4963
03:41:28,310 --> 03:41:29,350
Stop moving.

4964
03:41:31,450 --> 03:41:32,850
Criminal scum.

4965
03:41:33,370 --> 03:41:34,270
Shoot.

4966
03:41:36,610 --> 03:41:37,650
Got his ass.

4967
03:41:43,290 --> 03:41:43,930
Dang it.

4968
03:41:44,510 --> 03:41:45,350
That was close.

4969
03:41:49,530 --> 03:41:50,990
Oh, this guy is tough.

4970
03:41:58,160 --> 03:41:58,860
Oh, gosh.

4971
03:42:06,410 --> 03:42:07,430
Oh, gosh.

4972
03:42:08,310 --> 03:42:09,270
Take that.

4973
03:42:09,870 --> 03:42:10,030
Oh, wait.

4974
03:42:10,150 --> 03:42:11,570
Let me take your potion of sickness.

4975
03:42:12,530 --> 03:42:13,070
Nice job.

4976
03:42:13,270 --> 03:42:13,790
Thank you.

4977
03:42:15,770 --> 03:42:16,370
Bye.

4978
03:42:16,650 --> 03:42:16,950
I...

4979
03:42:16,950 --> 03:42:17,370
You guys.

4980
03:42:17,570 --> 03:42:18,330
I like sn...

4981
03:42:18,330 --> 03:42:19,390
I like sniping.

4982
03:42:20,010 --> 03:42:20,710
You know?

4983
03:42:21,410 --> 03:42:22,570
It's like my thing.

4984
03:42:27,390 --> 03:42:28,590
I like it.

4985
03:42:31,690 --> 03:42:32,430
I like it.

4986
03:42:39,590 --> 03:42:40,950
Slap a scope on that bow.

4987
03:42:41,050 --> 03:42:41,550
I know.

4988
03:42:41,790 --> 03:42:42,650
I wish, right?

4989
03:42:43,110 --> 03:42:44,070
Wait, where are we?

4990
03:42:45,730 --> 03:42:46,770
Oh, we're here.

4991
03:42:50,130 --> 03:42:51,730
Wait, what's this path, though?

4992
03:42:54,030 --> 03:42:55,710
I just want to check it out real quick.

4993
03:42:57,690 --> 03:43:00,350
We need to go to Ochi-va.

4994
03:43:02,710 --> 03:43:04,930
Ochi-va, Ochi-va.

4995
03:43:06,610 --> 03:43:08,110
Ochi-va, Ochi...

4996
03:43:08,110 --> 03:43:08,610
Oh.

4997
03:43:09,470 --> 03:43:11,910
Knights of the Thorn Lodge.

4998
03:43:13,490 --> 03:43:14,010
Wow.

4999
03:43:15,850 --> 03:43:17,610
This place probably smelled nice.

5000
03:43:24,910 --> 03:43:25,430
Oh.

5001
03:43:26,790 --> 03:43:27,310
Uh.

5002
03:43:29,990 --> 03:43:31,950
Do you think they'll get mad at me if I go in?

5003
03:43:36,770 --> 03:43:37,290
Hmm.

5004
03:43:39,910 --> 03:43:40,150
Oh.

5005
03:43:40,370 --> 03:43:41,150
There's a repair hammer.

5006
03:43:41,310 --> 03:43:41,630
I'll take that.

5007
03:43:43,310 --> 03:43:46,490
Her enemies fear thine one-on-one unrest.

5008
03:43:49,450 --> 03:43:51,130
I still don't feel like...

5009
03:43:51,130 --> 03:43:52,170
I don't know if I can...

5010
03:43:57,450 --> 03:44:01,470
I don't know if I can kill that one guy in one hit, you know?

5011
03:44:01,690 --> 03:44:02,530
I'm trespassing.

5012
03:44:05,950 --> 03:44:06,630
What was that?

5013
03:44:06,990 --> 03:44:07,510
Is that me?

5014
03:44:08,090 --> 03:44:08,550
My bad.

5015
03:44:09,450 --> 03:44:09,610
Sorry.

5016
03:44:10,810 --> 03:44:11,010
Oh!

5017
03:44:13,130 --> 03:44:14,430
I think you should leave.

5018
03:44:15,630 --> 03:44:16,070
Um.

5019
03:44:16,310 --> 03:44:16,630
Why?

5020
03:44:16,790 --> 03:44:20,290
As the newest member of the Knights of the Thorn, I bid you welcome.

5021
03:44:20,450 --> 03:44:21,970
You just said I should leave!

5022
03:44:24,790 --> 03:44:27,850
I've heard that Hill the Thorn knows a lot about alteration.

5023
03:44:28,050 --> 03:44:30,070
I'm getting fixed messages here!

5024
03:44:32,090 --> 03:44:33,230
Should I leave?

5025
03:44:33,510 --> 03:44:33,950
Should I go?

5026
03:44:34,210 --> 03:44:35,030
What do you mean?

5027
03:44:36,170 --> 03:44:36,690
Farewell.

5028
03:44:37,110 --> 03:44:37,490
Bye-bye.

5029
03:44:41,320 --> 03:44:42,740
So I can...

5030
03:44:42,740 --> 03:44:43,980
look around a little bit?

5031
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:45,420
He's following me.

5032
03:44:46,500 --> 03:44:47,340
I don't...

5033
03:44:47,340 --> 03:44:51,440
I think it's fine if I, like, you know...

5034
03:44:53,160 --> 03:44:54,620
He's monitoring me.

5035
03:44:56,600 --> 03:44:57,540
I'm not gonna...

5036
03:44:57,540 --> 03:44:57,800
I'm...

5037
03:44:57,800 --> 03:44:58,360
I'll be...

5038
03:44:58,360 --> 03:44:58,720
I'm...

5039
03:44:58,720 --> 03:44:59,660
I'm being good.

5040
03:44:59,800 --> 03:45:00,400
I'm being good.

5041
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:02,180
Ooh, who's better is this?

5042
03:45:02,200 --> 03:45:02,860
It's fancy.

5043
03:45:03,760 --> 03:45:05,000
This is your last warning.

5044
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:07,500
Get out, or I'll call the guards and have you arrested.

5045
03:45:10,240 --> 03:45:11,680
I don't want to be arrested.

5046
03:45:13,520 --> 03:45:14,800
Well, at least I went in.

5047
03:45:14,900 --> 03:45:16,880
We got the nicest possible guard.

5048
03:45:19,020 --> 03:45:20,780
He's going to report you.

5049
03:45:21,340 --> 03:45:23,700
We got the nicest possible guy...

5050
03:45:23,700 --> 03:45:25,060
to kick us out.

5051
03:45:31,640 --> 03:45:34,120
Is that a bandit down there, or...

5052
03:45:35,660 --> 03:45:36,920
a guard?

5053
03:45:38,080 --> 03:45:39,380
Wait, where'd he go?

5054
03:45:41,240 --> 03:45:42,530
This is...

5055
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:43,380
Wait, where'd he go?

5056
03:45:43,460 --> 03:45:43,560
Oh.

5057
03:45:44,340 --> 03:45:45,500
That is...

5058
03:45:45,500 --> 03:45:46,380
a guard.

5059
03:45:48,660 --> 03:45:49,520
Yeah.

5060
03:45:54,310 --> 03:45:56,110
You remind me of my homeland.

5061
03:45:56,830 --> 03:45:57,910
During the Blight.

5062
03:45:58,810 --> 03:45:59,290
Damn!

5063
03:46:01,470 --> 03:46:03,290
Vyna, I just met you!

5064
03:46:03,630 --> 03:46:06,790
If you want to buy a horse, go inside and talk to Tovis.

5065
03:46:06,930 --> 03:46:08,250
I don't want to give you any money.

5066
03:46:08,730 --> 03:46:09,210
I...

5067
03:46:10,650 --> 03:46:13,070
There were lights spotted at Sundercliff Watch.

5068
03:46:13,350 --> 03:46:16,710
That place was cursed by Mehrunes Dagon himself.

5069
03:46:17,130 --> 03:46:18,690
Best not to go there.

5070
03:46:20,950 --> 03:46:22,130
Stop talking!

5071
03:46:22,590 --> 03:46:23,610
She's so rude.

5072
03:46:24,810 --> 03:46:26,130
Alright, so we go inside.

5073
03:46:26,230 --> 03:46:26,870
Wait.

5074
03:46:28,230 --> 03:46:33,150
We go in, and we go to the black door, and then we ask for somebody.

5075
03:46:36,070 --> 03:46:37,470
Everyone's so rude.

5076
03:46:45,110 --> 03:46:46,030
It's an inn.

5077
03:46:46,110 --> 03:46:47,570
Wow, this place is so cute.

5078
03:46:47,930 --> 03:46:48,950
I lied.

5079
03:46:49,150 --> 03:46:50,990
Okay, this is my new favorite town.

5080
03:46:51,230 --> 03:46:52,150
Oh my god.

5081
03:46:53,990 --> 03:46:55,150
Everything's purple.

5082
03:46:56,430 --> 03:46:57,710
Oh my god.

5083
03:46:57,710 --> 03:46:58,790
Everything is purple.

5084
03:46:59,110 --> 03:47:00,050
It's so pretty.

5085
03:47:00,370 --> 03:47:00,790
And look.

5086
03:47:01,110 --> 03:47:02,370
It reminds me.

5087
03:47:02,550 --> 03:47:02,970
Oh my gosh.

5088
03:47:03,030 --> 03:47:05,950
With the castle and the mountain, it reminds me of...

5089
03:47:05,950 --> 03:47:06,830
In...

5090
03:47:08,150 --> 03:47:09,190
Tokyo Disneyland.

5091
03:47:09,710 --> 03:47:10,770
There's a...

5092
03:47:10,770 --> 03:47:11,290
There's...

5093
03:47:11,290 --> 03:47:12,170
The castle.

5094
03:47:12,870 --> 03:47:13,350
And...

5095
03:47:13,350 --> 03:47:13,830
Uh...

5096
03:47:13,830 --> 03:47:14,530
If we're like...

5097
03:47:14,530 --> 03:47:15,870
Belle's part of the area.

5098
03:47:16,090 --> 03:47:17,610
It's the beast castle and stuff.

5099
03:47:17,770 --> 03:47:19,610
And it looks so similar to this.

5100
03:47:22,090 --> 03:47:24,070
This one is so pretty.

5101
03:47:24,150 --> 03:47:25,590
I want to live here.

5102
03:47:26,690 --> 03:47:28,010
I want to live here.

5103
03:47:30,130 --> 03:47:30,650
Yes.

5104
03:47:30,890 --> 03:47:32,010
I'm gonna buy a house here.

5105
03:47:33,250 --> 03:47:34,430
Look at the graveyard.

5106
03:47:36,870 --> 03:47:38,190
Feels just like home.

5107
03:47:40,430 --> 03:47:41,870
You can get a house here?

5108
03:47:42,030 --> 03:47:42,590
Hot dog.

5109
03:47:42,950 --> 03:47:44,310
Wait, this door is not black.

5110
03:47:46,830 --> 03:47:48,370
Wait, I should go towards here.

5111
03:47:50,270 --> 03:47:50,790
Oh.

5112
03:48:11,470 --> 03:48:12,770
This is the place.

5113
03:48:28,750 --> 03:48:29,790
The music.

5114
03:48:31,030 --> 03:48:31,890
Bread loaf.

5115
03:48:37,900 --> 03:48:39,840
The waters of oblivion.

5116
03:48:43,130 --> 03:48:44,750
Alright, let's go knock on the door.

5117
03:48:45,290 --> 03:48:46,530
Wait, I don't remember who to ask.

5118
03:48:46,650 --> 03:48:47,930
Oh, what do I say?

5119
03:48:48,290 --> 03:48:48,850
Hold on.

5120
03:48:51,670 --> 03:48:52,850
Sanguine my brother.

5121
03:48:54,730 --> 03:48:56,690
Oh, we're talking to Ochiva.

5122
03:48:56,910 --> 03:48:58,410
I thought that was the place we needed to go.

5123
03:49:00,570 --> 03:49:01,750
Sanguine my brother.

5124
03:49:20,560 --> 03:49:21,780
Oh, flip side.

5125
03:49:22,260 --> 03:49:22,740
Empty.

5126
03:49:24,900 --> 03:49:26,120
I'm just like...

5127
03:49:26,120 --> 03:49:27,020
Oh, my bad.

5128
03:49:29,180 --> 03:49:30,560
I'm just looking around.

5129
03:49:31,940 --> 03:49:33,440
It's a abandoned house anyway.

5130
03:49:42,910 --> 03:49:44,710
Oh my god.

5131
03:49:45,070 --> 03:49:46,510
This feels like...

5132
03:49:46,510 --> 03:49:47,210
Oh my god.

5133
03:49:48,770 --> 03:49:50,510
Hot dog indeed.

5134
03:49:51,310 --> 03:49:52,330
Here's some Pocky friends.

5135
03:50:03,590 --> 03:50:04,150
Sanguine...

5136
03:50:04,150 --> 03:50:05,690
Oh, I thought it was going to be multiple choice.

5137
03:50:07,230 --> 03:50:08,510
Sanguine my brother.

5138
03:50:13,130 --> 03:50:16,130
I've gained entrance into the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.

5139
03:50:16,350 --> 03:50:18,170
I must now speak with Ochiva.

5140
03:50:24,190 --> 03:50:24,930
Tadai ma.

5141
03:50:26,250 --> 03:50:27,690
Oh, there's a skelly here.

5142
03:50:27,950 --> 03:50:28,570
Greetings, greetings.

5143
03:50:28,970 --> 03:50:31,910
I am Ochiva, mistress of this sanctuary.

5144
03:50:32,750 --> 03:50:35,110
Lucian has told me all about you.

5145
03:50:35,310 --> 03:50:38,590
Let me welcome you to the Dark Brotherhood.

5146
03:50:38,870 --> 03:50:39,050
Hmm.

5147
03:50:39,750 --> 03:50:43,510
It is always a pleasure to welcome another Dark Sister into our ranks.

5148
03:50:43,730 --> 03:50:47,290
Truly, the night mother smiles upon her trusted daughters.

5149
03:50:48,090 --> 03:50:50,690
You stand now in our sanctuary.

5150
03:50:50,690 --> 03:50:57,350
May it serve as your new home, a place of comfort and security whenever the need arises.

5151
03:50:57,350 --> 03:50:58,350
Thank you.

5152
03:50:58,550 --> 03:51:02,530
When you're ready for work, go and speak with Vicente Valtieri.

5153
03:51:02,850 --> 03:51:05,530
He handles all assignments for new family members.

5154
03:51:05,930 --> 03:51:06,670
Vicente Valtieri.

5155
03:51:06,970 --> 03:51:11,050
But before you go, please, accept this gift from your new family.

5156
03:51:11,510 --> 03:51:16,370
A unique set of armor, lighter than normal leather and black as the void.

5157
03:51:17,070 --> 03:51:18,630
But I've kept you long enough.

5158
03:51:19,190 --> 03:51:20,130
Vicente is waiting.

5159
03:51:20,430 --> 03:51:21,950
You'll find him in his quarters.

5160
03:51:22,550 --> 03:51:24,950
Go now, my child, and may Sithis go with you.

5161
03:51:27,590 --> 03:51:28,850
Wait, I want to see our armor.

5162
03:51:28,990 --> 03:51:34,370
Go now, dear family member, and may the night mother wrap you in her cold, loving embrace.

5163
03:51:42,380 --> 03:51:43,180
Shrouded armor.

5164
03:51:44,220 --> 03:51:46,100
This is stylish.

5165
03:51:46,460 --> 03:51:47,460
Are you kidding me?

5166
03:51:49,640 --> 03:51:51,060
No, we can't wear the hood, though.

5167
03:51:51,420 --> 03:51:51,840
No, no, no.

5168
03:51:52,680 --> 03:51:52,940
This?

5169
03:51:53,480 --> 03:51:54,220
Oh, my gosh.

5170
03:51:54,340 --> 03:51:55,100
And the effects?

5171
03:51:58,940 --> 03:51:59,560
Oh, right.

5172
03:51:59,680 --> 03:52:00,280
Your E.T.

5173
03:52:00,600 --> 03:52:01,260
Yep, yep, yep.

5174
03:52:03,220 --> 03:52:04,060
Yep, yep, yep.

5175
03:52:05,700 --> 03:52:07,800
Wait, this looks amazing, though.

5176
03:52:09,100 --> 03:52:09,720
Oh, sorry.

5177
03:52:09,880 --> 03:52:10,580
Oh, sorry.

5178
03:52:10,840 --> 03:52:11,620
Wait, sorry.

5179
03:52:11,880 --> 03:52:12,900
Oh, sorry.

5180
03:52:13,200 --> 03:52:13,900
Wait, sorry.

5181
03:52:14,440 --> 03:52:14,920
Sorry.

5182
03:52:15,420 --> 03:52:17,160
I didn't realize it was a full suit.

5183
03:52:19,380 --> 03:52:24,440
A little pocket change for you to buy some more sussy knot, save for streaming cream pastry.

5184
03:52:24,700 --> 03:52:24,840
Stop!

5185
03:52:27,700 --> 03:52:28,640
Thank you, though.

5186
03:52:32,540 --> 03:52:33,500
Dark guardian.

5187
03:52:35,540 --> 03:52:36,380
Oh, my gosh.

5188
03:52:36,420 --> 03:52:37,940
We get to see a skelly up close.

5189
03:52:38,160 --> 03:52:38,940
He's even wearing...

5190
03:52:38,940 --> 03:52:40,340
We're wearing the same outfit.

5191
03:52:40,700 --> 03:52:41,220
Wait.

5192
03:52:41,900 --> 03:52:44,320
I am honored by your presence.

5193
03:52:44,620 --> 03:52:46,760
How can Ochiva be of assistance?

5194
03:52:47,040 --> 03:52:47,880
I'm looking...

5195
03:52:47,880 --> 03:52:48,800
Wait, who am I talking to?

5196
03:52:49,160 --> 03:52:49,480
You?

5197
03:52:50,260 --> 03:52:50,900
No.

5198
03:52:52,100 --> 03:52:52,460
Wait.

5199
03:52:52,460 --> 03:52:55,740
I wish to welcome you to this sanctuary, my newest sister.

5200
03:52:55,980 --> 03:52:56,740
Oh, my gosh.

5201
03:52:57,640 --> 03:52:58,500
Thanks, fam.

5202
03:52:58,720 --> 03:53:00,540
I've heard so much about you.

5203
03:53:00,620 --> 03:53:01,000
You have?

5204
03:53:01,260 --> 03:53:02,740
Welcome to our family.

5205
03:53:02,880 --> 03:53:04,200
Sneaking suit acquired.

5206
03:53:04,800 --> 03:53:05,440
Yeah.

5207
03:53:07,680 --> 03:53:09,180
Oh, whoa.

5208
03:53:12,280 --> 03:53:13,780
Training room?

5209
03:53:14,120 --> 03:53:14,720
What's that?

5210
03:53:15,420 --> 03:53:16,960
Oh, my gosh.

5211
03:53:18,720 --> 03:53:20,220
How cute!

5212
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:24,840
What's that?

5213
03:53:25,240 --> 03:53:26,240
What are these?

5214
03:53:26,780 --> 03:53:26,900
Oh.

5215
03:53:31,970 --> 03:53:32,930
Oh.

5216
03:53:33,990 --> 03:53:34,290
Oh.

5217
03:53:34,330 --> 03:53:34,570
Oh, wow.

5218
03:53:34,570 --> 03:53:34,570
Oh.

5219
03:53:36,610 --> 03:53:37,870
Crystal ball.

5220
03:53:40,930 --> 03:53:42,310
Stuff to hit.

5221
03:53:42,590 --> 03:53:42,790
Yeah.

5222
03:53:43,530 --> 03:53:45,810
We can actually train in here.

5223
03:53:46,130 --> 03:53:46,690
It's so fun.

5224
03:53:49,810 --> 03:53:51,770
A zero tragedy.

5225
03:53:56,450 --> 03:53:57,290
French.

5226
03:54:03,430 --> 03:54:05,150
I like it down here.

5227
03:54:06,430 --> 03:54:08,510
I've heard so much about you.

5228
03:54:08,630 --> 03:54:09,310
What's the point?

5229
03:54:09,810 --> 03:54:13,070
Why should anyone bother with all that sneaking and skulking?

5230
03:54:13,310 --> 03:54:14,690
I like sneaking and skulking.

5231
03:54:15,730 --> 03:54:18,350
You are a life taker for the Dark Brotherhood.

5232
03:54:19,130 --> 03:54:23,270
Our very existence relies on shadow and deception.

5233
03:54:24,010 --> 03:54:26,590
Do you not value our secrets?

5234
03:54:27,270 --> 03:54:28,210
Yes, yes.

5235
03:54:28,210 --> 03:54:29,950
Of course, I value our secrets.

5236
03:54:30,070 --> 03:54:31,830
And I have never betrayed them.

5237
03:54:32,330 --> 03:54:35,910
But using stealth to kill, it's just so...

5238
03:54:35,910 --> 03:54:35,910
weak.

5239
03:54:36,170 --> 03:54:36,570
What?

5240
03:54:36,870 --> 03:54:40,830
But brother, what of the contracts that require subtlety?

5241
03:54:41,570 --> 03:54:45,730
You must at least strive to earn the bonuses that are offered.

5242
03:54:46,710 --> 03:54:47,290
Bonuses.

5243
03:54:47,650 --> 03:54:48,770
Ha ha ha ha.

5244
03:54:49,630 --> 03:54:50,750
Useless, I say.

5245
03:54:51,110 --> 03:54:57,810
Gold and magical trinkets are no substitute for the freedom to slaughter anyone I please, at any time.

5246
03:54:58,030 --> 03:54:58,730
That's fair.

5247
03:54:58,910 --> 03:55:00,010
Oh, Gogrin.

5248
03:55:00,930 --> 03:55:05,950
Your methods may be crude, but your heart is always in the right place.

5249
03:55:06,650 --> 03:55:07,790
There you are.

5250
03:55:08,190 --> 03:55:08,690
Welcome.

5251
03:55:08,930 --> 03:55:09,350
Welcome.

5252
03:55:09,610 --> 03:55:09,910
Welcome.

5253
03:55:09,910 --> 03:55:13,370
I like your armor, mister, but you're not matching like the rest of us.

5254
03:55:14,010 --> 03:55:15,390
Wait, who are you?

5255
03:55:15,390 --> 03:55:17,730
It is an honor to make your acquaintance.

5256
03:55:17,950 --> 03:55:18,470
Hello.

5257
03:55:19,170 --> 03:55:21,850
I'm trying to meet the person that will give me a quest.

5258
03:55:22,790 --> 03:55:23,910
Get away from me.

5259
03:55:24,090 --> 03:55:24,250
Oh.

5260
03:55:24,910 --> 03:55:27,410
If it isn't the newest member of the family.

5261
03:55:27,590 --> 03:55:28,590
Makes me want to talk to you more.

5262
03:55:28,590 --> 03:55:29,670
Let's get one thing straight.

5263
03:55:30,050 --> 03:55:32,350
The tenants prevent me from killing you.

5264
03:55:32,710 --> 03:55:34,550
But I don't have to like you.

5265
03:55:34,850 --> 03:55:38,890
I'll sell you equipment, but only because Ochiva is making me.

5266
03:55:39,250 --> 03:55:42,430
This family doesn't need any outsiders.

5267
03:55:43,550 --> 03:55:45,090
I'm part of the family.

5268
03:55:46,830 --> 03:55:47,870
Purchasing spells.

5269
03:55:49,070 --> 03:55:50,530
Foul smelling ape.

5270
03:55:52,610 --> 03:55:53,790
I'm an elf.

5271
03:55:54,470 --> 03:55:54,890
You again?

5272
03:55:55,230 --> 03:55:56,610
I thought I'd made it clear.

5273
03:55:56,890 --> 03:55:58,050
I am not looking for a friend.

5274
03:55:58,070 --> 03:55:59,190
Wait, now I really want to be his friend.

5275
03:55:59,430 --> 03:56:01,930
If you're here to buy or sell something, get on with it already.

5276
03:56:02,210 --> 03:56:02,650
Let's see.

5277
03:56:02,750 --> 03:56:02,970
Wait.

5278
03:56:03,350 --> 03:56:04,270
Oh, I can't even.

5279
03:56:04,450 --> 03:56:05,110
I can't even.

5280
03:56:09,830 --> 03:56:12,210
This position is actually quite high.

5281
03:56:12,530 --> 03:56:12,830
No?

5282
03:56:14,410 --> 03:56:16,490
For someone who's so upset-y.

5283
03:56:16,870 --> 03:56:17,370
Spaghetti.

5284
03:56:18,390 --> 03:56:20,610
He's just a little tsundere man.

5285
03:56:21,590 --> 03:56:23,830
Bow of infernal frost.

5286
03:56:25,830 --> 03:56:27,690
Fire damage on strike.

5287
03:56:27,970 --> 03:56:28,810
Frost damage.

5288
03:56:29,230 --> 03:56:30,650
Arrow of cowardice.

5289
03:56:30,810 --> 03:56:31,810
Demoralize on strike.

5290
03:56:33,350 --> 03:56:34,390
Oh, boy.

5291
03:56:34,750 --> 03:56:35,550
Golly, guys.

5292
03:56:37,950 --> 03:56:39,070
More steel arrows.

5293
03:56:39,190 --> 03:56:39,950
We can buy some here.

5294
03:56:40,130 --> 03:56:41,010
We can buy the five tenants.

5295
03:56:44,110 --> 03:56:45,310
I see this.

5296
03:56:45,430 --> 03:56:46,410
I don't have all day.

5297
03:56:46,750 --> 03:56:47,250
Hurry up.

5298
03:56:47,590 --> 03:56:48,670
Okay, okay.

5299
03:56:51,050 --> 03:56:51,530
Wait.

5300
03:56:51,730 --> 03:56:53,130
Can I... Can you buy things?

5301
03:56:53,350 --> 03:56:53,750
I see this.

5302
03:56:53,750 --> 03:56:54,870
I don't have all day.

5303
03:56:55,270 --> 03:56:55,670
Hurry up.

5304
03:56:55,670 --> 03:56:58,190
Can he buy the things that I've stolen?

5305
03:56:58,790 --> 03:56:59,190
No.

5306
03:56:59,450 --> 03:56:59,710
Oh, wait.

5307
03:56:59,810 --> 03:56:59,910
No.

5308
03:57:00,170 --> 03:57:00,870
I'm at the wrong guild.

5309
03:57:01,110 --> 03:57:02,390
Foul-smelling ape.

5310
03:57:03,650 --> 03:57:04,710
Rude, kitty cat.

5311
03:57:08,820 --> 03:57:12,040
For some reason, you think that a sleeping slab...

5312
03:57:12,740 --> 03:57:14,680
For some reason, you think the Dark...

5313
03:57:14,680 --> 03:57:18,200
The Dark Brothers Guild would also be fine with stolen items.

5314
03:57:18,380 --> 03:57:19,200
But, oh...

5315
03:57:24,570 --> 03:57:26,770
It doesn't say that it's...

5316
03:57:27,890 --> 03:57:29,170
Note to Ochiwa.

5317
03:57:29,930 --> 03:57:31,330
What does that say?

5318
03:57:32,130 --> 03:57:33,130
I'm nosy.

5319
03:57:38,510 --> 03:57:39,650
I'm nosy.

5320
03:57:39,830 --> 03:57:40,410
Where is it?

5321
03:57:41,090 --> 03:57:41,570
There it is.

5322
03:57:46,090 --> 03:57:46,730
Ochiwa.

5323
03:57:47,090 --> 03:57:50,810
Damn that young fool, Antoinetta, and her experimental recipes.

5324
03:57:50,810 --> 03:57:53,670
As if the stench of her cooking weren't bad enough.

5325
03:57:53,810 --> 03:57:57,910
Last week, she made a particularly offensive dish consisting of mandrake, onions...

5326
03:57:58,530 --> 03:57:59,350
Dot, dot, dot...

5327
03:57:59,350 --> 03:58:00,390
And garlic!

5328
03:58:00,730 --> 03:58:01,810
Oh, he's a vampire!

5329
03:58:02,310 --> 03:58:03,430
He's a vampire!

5330
03:58:04,090 --> 03:58:04,570
Garlic!

5331
03:58:04,950 --> 03:58:10,250
I have told her repeatedly of the danger this plant poses to me, but she has obviously not heeded my warnings.

5332
03:58:10,530 --> 03:58:13,070
It is strange, this reaction I have to garlic.

5333
03:58:13,070 --> 03:58:17,950
In all my wanderings, in all my research, I have never encountered another vampire thusly affected.

5334
03:58:18,210 --> 03:58:24,690
It is true that some popular lore holds that all vampires have an inherent weakness to garlic, but this is simply not the case.

5335
03:58:24,850 --> 03:58:27,130
My situation, as far as I can tell, is unique.

5336
03:58:27,130 --> 03:58:35,630
If I were to somehow come into contact with garlic, if it in some way came to be on my person, the results could be catastrophic.

5337
03:58:36,130 --> 03:58:39,770
I would most certainly suffer from a loss of strength and stamina.

5338
03:58:40,450 --> 03:58:45,790
And fear my resistance to magic would be nearly completely nullified.

5339
03:58:46,290 --> 03:58:51,490
So please, Ochiwa, as mistress of this sanctuary, I beg you to keep Antoinetta on a tighter leash.

5340
03:58:51,610 --> 03:58:52,950
I love her as a sister.

5341
03:58:55,790 --> 03:58:56,750
Of course.

5342
03:58:57,250 --> 03:59:03,490
But cannot be held accountable for my actions, should she continue to disregard my own personal safety.

5343
03:59:03,990 --> 03:59:07,470
The tenants clearly state that one family member may not kill another.

5344
03:59:07,690 --> 03:59:13,490
But I don't need to remind you there is no restriction against draining Antoinetta of a few pints of precious life's blood.

5345
03:59:14,250 --> 03:59:19,410
Certain Dark Brotherhood members have some very funny bug.

5346
03:59:19,530 --> 03:59:20,410
Hopefully you will see it.

5347
03:59:20,410 --> 03:59:22,230
It's a very shiny forehead.

5348
03:59:22,430 --> 03:59:22,510
Oh.

5349
03:59:24,270 --> 03:59:25,550
Let's put this back.

5350
03:59:25,970 --> 03:59:27,350
He's just staring at me.

5351
03:59:28,270 --> 03:59:29,570
I don't need it.

5352
03:59:32,370 --> 03:59:33,290
There we go.

5353
03:59:35,570 --> 03:59:37,190
Ah, here you are.

5354
03:59:37,510 --> 03:59:39,690
So good to finally meet you.

5355
03:59:40,510 --> 03:59:41,890
Warmest greetings to you.

5356
03:59:42,130 --> 03:59:44,550
I trust you've already spoken with Ochiwa?

5357
03:59:44,730 --> 03:59:45,050
Yes.

5358
03:59:45,050 --> 03:59:46,510
I am Vicente Valtieri.

5359
03:59:46,770 --> 03:59:49,930
I provide assignments for all new family members.

5360
03:59:50,070 --> 03:59:50,850
He's bald!

5361
03:59:51,150 --> 03:59:53,550
Please, do not let my appearance unnerve you.

5362
03:59:53,910 --> 03:59:58,610
The needs and tenets of the Dark Brotherhood come before my own needs as a vampire.

5363
03:59:59,110 --> 04:00:03,430
Now, if you're ready to get to work, I can provide you with your first contract.

5364
04:00:03,430 --> 04:00:05,050
Yes, please.

5365
04:00:06,830 --> 04:00:07,570
Wait.

5366
04:00:07,850 --> 04:00:10,250
The bald is a- Is a bug?

5367
04:00:10,710 --> 04:00:13,390
He's not supposed to be bald!

5368
04:00:20,010 --> 04:00:22,830
He wasn't bald in my game!

5369
04:00:32,990 --> 04:00:36,190
I thought it- I thought it suited his character!

5370
04:00:36,690 --> 04:00:37,570
I just-

5371
04:00:53,970 --> 04:00:55,510
It comes back!

5372
04:00:55,530 --> 04:00:56,510
Oh my gosh!

5373
04:00:56,510 --> 04:01:03,930
I was stricken with vampirism 300 years ago, while on an expedition deep into the ashlands of Vardenfell.

5374
04:01:04,370 --> 04:01:08,810
For nearly a hundred years I hunted in secret, until the Dark Brotherhood- Oh, I'm crying!

5375
04:01:09,130 --> 04:01:09,730
It's so funny!

5376
04:01:09,910 --> 04:01:14,110
Now I have a family that accepts and even values my unique gift.

5377
04:01:14,230 --> 04:01:15,330
Sometimes it comes back!

5378
04:01:15,330 --> 04:01:19,770
Perhaps in the future, when I feel you have earned the right- I can't believe he's supposed to have it!

5379
04:01:19,770 --> 04:01:21,050
To become a hunter of the night.

5380
04:01:24,970 --> 04:01:26,210
Give me a contract!

5381
04:01:26,350 --> 04:01:28,950
A contract is a secret pact one enters into with the Dark Brotherhood.

5382
04:01:29,550 --> 04:01:33,810
They provide us with gold, and we remove someone from existence.

5383
04:01:34,530 --> 04:01:38,910
A contract is fulfilled by a skilled assassin, such as yourself- I'm skilled!

5384
04:01:38,930 --> 04:01:41,170
Who keeps the Dark Brotherhood's end of the bargain.

5385
04:01:41,570 --> 04:01:43,190
So it has always been.

5386
04:01:43,810 --> 04:01:49,710
While carrying out a contract, you may have the opportunity to earn a bonus if certain parameters are met.

5387
04:01:50,350 --> 04:01:50,830
Yes, sir.

5388
04:01:50,830 --> 04:01:52,970
Now, let's begin, shall we?

5389
04:01:53,130 --> 04:01:53,930
Yes, sir.

5390
04:01:53,950 --> 04:01:57,070
I'm not sure how you feel about pirates, but you've got to kill one.

5391
04:01:57,130 --> 04:01:57,590
Wait, wait!

5392
04:01:57,770 --> 04:01:58,690
A captain, in fact.

5393
04:01:58,870 --> 04:01:59,170
Wait!

5394
04:01:59,390 --> 04:01:59,930
On his ship.

5395
04:01:59,990 --> 04:02:00,310
Wait!

5396
04:02:00,550 --> 04:02:01,790
Surrounded by his crew.

5397
04:02:02,750 --> 04:02:03,230
Interested?

5398
04:02:10,430 --> 04:02:11,830
The guys from before?

5399
04:02:15,910 --> 04:02:17,050
It is time.

5400
04:02:18,870 --> 04:02:19,350
Excellent.

5401
04:02:20,170 --> 04:02:21,610
Here is what you must do.

5402
04:02:22,150 --> 04:02:24,990
Go to the waterfront district of the Imperial City.

5403
04:02:25,590 --> 04:02:28,330
There you will find a ship named the Marie Elena.

5404
04:02:29,190 --> 04:02:32,550
Board the ship and find its captain, Gaston Tussaud.

5405
04:02:33,170 --> 04:02:34,350
He'll be in his cabin.

5406
04:02:35,310 --> 04:02:37,670
Eliminate Tussaud in any manner you see fit.

5407
04:02:37,890 --> 04:02:40,890
The pirates have been moving a lot of cargo on board lately.

5408
04:02:41,090 --> 04:02:44,490
You may be able to smuggle yourself on board in one of the packing crates.

5409
04:02:44,670 --> 04:02:45,730
Just a wax.

5410
04:02:45,730 --> 04:02:46,650
And one more thing.

5411
04:02:47,230 --> 04:02:51,470
Get into the habit of asking your fellow family members about any current contract.

5412
04:02:51,910 --> 04:02:54,310
Their insight may prove invaluable.

5413
04:02:55,810 --> 04:02:56,970
I don't want to ask.

5414
04:02:57,870 --> 04:02:58,890
Farewell, sister.

5415
04:02:59,570 --> 04:03:02,530
I want to hope that maybe his hair comes back.

5416
04:03:09,830 --> 04:03:10,470
Oh, wow.

5417
04:03:11,050 --> 04:03:11,690
Oh, wow.

5418
04:03:12,110 --> 04:03:13,330
Oh, wow.

5419
04:03:19,930 --> 04:03:20,790
Save and reload.

5420
04:03:21,210 --> 04:03:22,150
Yeah, let's try it.

5421
04:03:23,230 --> 04:03:23,770
Wait, hold on.

5422
04:03:23,790 --> 04:03:24,510
I want to see what's in here.

5423
04:03:24,610 --> 04:03:25,410
Oh, living quarters.

5424
04:03:25,970 --> 04:03:26,750
Let's take a nap.

5425
04:03:26,930 --> 04:03:27,710
Maybe we take a nap.

5426
04:03:36,650 --> 04:03:38,210
A paintbrush.

5427
04:03:38,630 --> 04:03:39,910
They're quite art.

5428
04:03:40,090 --> 04:03:40,210
Oh!

5429
04:03:41,430 --> 04:03:41,990
Oh.

5430
04:03:43,430 --> 04:03:44,210
Skimmer.

5431
04:03:44,570 --> 04:03:45,770
I almost...

5432
04:03:46,060 --> 04:03:48,250
I almost instinctually...

5433
04:03:48,250 --> 04:03:49,350
attacked him.

5434
04:03:50,950 --> 04:03:54,750
My voice is starting to get a little bit icky, so...

5435
04:03:55,610 --> 04:03:57,050
I'm gonna take a nap.

5436
04:03:58,870 --> 04:03:59,650
For...

5437
04:03:59,650 --> 04:04:00,450
Uh...

5438
04:04:00,450 --> 04:04:01,190
Five hours.

5439
04:04:05,360 --> 04:04:06,280
Sleepy sleep.

5440
04:04:09,530 --> 04:04:10,250
Wait.

5441
04:04:10,730 --> 04:04:11,210
Oh.

5442
04:04:12,890 --> 04:04:14,670
But it's not stealing.

5443
04:04:17,030 --> 04:04:19,610
Oh my god, it's all five of them.

5444
04:04:39,810 --> 04:04:40,170
Easy!

5445
04:04:40,530 --> 04:04:41,790
Open easy lock!

5446
04:04:42,870 --> 04:04:44,150
Open easy lock!

5447
04:04:44,930 --> 04:04:46,570
Wait, can I take all these?

5448
04:04:48,630 --> 04:04:50,410
I just saw a picture of the dude.

5449
04:04:50,410 --> 04:04:51,990
He honestly looks better bald.

5450
04:04:52,170 --> 04:04:52,670
No kidding!

5451
04:04:56,310 --> 04:04:57,210
Yeah, I'm...

5452
04:04:57,210 --> 04:04:58,410
I'm god at...

5453
04:04:59,730 --> 04:05:00,890
Lock picking.

5454
04:05:01,490 --> 04:05:01,850
Yeah!

5455
04:05:04,150 --> 04:05:05,830
I'm actually pretty good.

5456
04:05:07,530 --> 04:05:07,970
Oh,

5457
04:05:17,150 --> 04:05:17,490
dang it!

5458
04:05:17,550 --> 04:05:18,210
I almost had it!

5459
04:05:20,170 --> 04:05:22,510
So this will judge if you steal from another...

5460
04:05:22,510 --> 04:05:23,070
other members.

5461
04:05:33,170 --> 04:05:33,650
Actually...

5462
04:05:33,650 --> 04:05:35,050
But it's not in the red.

5463
04:05:41,600 --> 04:05:42,080
Doesn't...

5464
04:05:42,080 --> 04:05:43,780
It only counts as stealing if it's red.

5465
04:05:47,800 --> 04:05:48,280
Oh...

5466
04:05:49,080 --> 04:05:50,580
It doesn't actually count.

5467
04:05:50,760 --> 04:05:51,860
Okay, you guys are scaring me.

5468
04:06:02,830 --> 04:06:03,930
Ah, so close.

5469
04:06:04,550 --> 04:06:05,370
Gop, gop, gop.

5470
04:06:05,970 --> 04:06:06,490
Pickpocking.

5471
04:06:06,750 --> 04:06:07,090
No!

5472
04:06:27,560 --> 04:06:28,760
Some more!

5473
04:06:35,890 --> 04:06:38,150
Say lock picking ten times fast.

5474
04:06:40,810 --> 04:06:41,930
Sithis allow it.

5475
04:06:42,930 --> 04:06:45,330
Sithis should allow it because I'm being so cool...

5476
04:06:46,250 --> 04:06:47,330
about it, you know?

5477
04:06:47,530 --> 04:06:49,790
If I were to pickpocket, that's one thing.

5478
04:06:50,310 --> 04:06:51,370
There you are.

5479
04:06:51,810 --> 04:06:52,290
Welcome.

5480
04:06:52,530 --> 04:06:52,950
Welcome.

5481
04:06:53,330 --> 04:06:53,890
I'm welcome.

5482
04:06:54,170 --> 04:06:56,210
It is an honor to make your acquaintance.

5483
04:06:56,230 --> 04:06:57,050
Why was this letter?

5484
04:06:57,530 --> 04:06:58,430
Shopping list?

5485
04:07:02,750 --> 04:07:04,470
I've been meaning to speak with you.

5486
04:07:04,790 --> 04:07:05,570
Of course.

5487
04:07:05,810 --> 04:07:06,450
What is it?

5488
04:07:06,790 --> 04:07:09,230
I've been meaning to ask you about your last contract.

5489
04:07:09,230 --> 04:07:09,810
I'm eavesdropping.

5490
04:07:09,810 --> 04:07:11,810
I heard there were some...

5491
04:07:13,030 --> 04:07:13,070
complications.

5492
04:07:13,990 --> 04:07:14,950
Ah, yes.

5493
04:07:15,050 --> 04:07:17,150
That was quite a situation I got myself into.

5494
04:07:17,150 --> 04:07:18,650
I've heard so much about you.

5495
04:07:18,810 --> 04:07:19,450
But I have to admit...

5496
04:07:19,450 --> 04:07:20,810
Welcome to our family.

5497
04:07:20,830 --> 04:07:22,530
I've had a bit of fun cleaning up my own mess.

5498
04:07:24,270 --> 04:07:26,610
You're truly an asset to this sanctuary.

5499
04:07:26,890 --> 04:07:29,930
Here's hoping all of our contracts work out that well.

5500
04:07:30,730 --> 04:07:31,810
Ah, well...

5501
04:07:31,810 --> 04:07:33,730
I suppose I should get...

5502
04:07:33,730 --> 04:07:34,530
Oh.

5503
04:07:35,570 --> 04:07:36,990
Sithis be with you, brother.

5504
04:07:37,750 --> 04:07:39,650
I like the rat that comes around.

5505
04:07:40,090 --> 04:07:40,530
Scammer.

5506
04:07:42,250 --> 04:07:42,950
Well, guys.

5507
04:07:43,190 --> 04:07:44,610
I think I'm gonna call it here.

5508
04:07:46,730 --> 04:07:48,450
Next time we'll do our contract.

5509
04:07:51,110 --> 04:07:51,550
And...

5510
04:07:52,210 --> 04:07:54,310
Let's go see if the guy has grown hair.

5511
04:07:55,310 --> 04:07:56,490
We have to find him.

5512
04:08:02,630 --> 04:08:03,970
We have to go find him.

5513
04:08:04,470 --> 04:08:05,410
Where did they all go?

5514
04:08:06,410 --> 04:08:06,990
Go back.

5515
04:08:06,990 --> 04:08:08,150
Maybe he's in his room again.

5516
04:08:08,770 --> 04:08:09,330
Uh...

5517
04:08:09,330 --> 04:08:09,950
We're in here?

5518
04:08:14,620 --> 04:08:15,880
Skelly boy, so cute.

5519
04:08:17,960 --> 04:08:18,520
No?

5520
04:08:18,760 --> 04:08:19,360
Where'd he go?

5521
04:08:20,220 --> 04:08:21,280
Where did he go?

5522
04:08:24,640 --> 04:08:27,040
Everyone's talking about your latest exploits.

5523
04:08:27,320 --> 04:08:32,580
Not only did you eliminate the target, but his six Imperial Legion escorts as well.

5524
04:08:32,760 --> 04:08:33,000
Whoa!

5525
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:34,220
Most impressive.

5526
04:08:34,800 --> 04:08:40,900
All right, so I may have gotten a bit careless, but the contract was fulfilled, wasn't it?

5527
04:08:41,360 --> 04:08:43,420
In the end, that's all that matters.

5528
04:08:44,200 --> 04:08:48,660
Sometimes I wonder how you survive it all without me being there to watch your back.

5529
04:08:50,220 --> 04:08:52,640
Well, I should return to my duty.

5530
04:08:53,260 --> 04:08:53,820
Why?

5531
04:08:54,380 --> 04:08:56,520
Oh, you wanted to hug me?

5532
04:08:56,680 --> 04:08:57,540
Is that what you just said?

5533
04:08:59,920 --> 04:09:01,920
So, your first contract.

5534
04:09:02,260 --> 04:09:04,140
No chance for a bonus, huh?

5535
04:09:04,620 --> 04:09:05,440
That's all right.

5536
04:09:05,760 --> 04:09:06,800
You're better off.

5537
04:09:06,940 --> 04:09:09,900
Who needs magic items when you've got raw skill?

5538
04:09:10,540 --> 04:09:16,520
And the great thing about killing a target up close and personal is you can talk to them before you do it.

5539
04:09:16,680 --> 04:09:18,960
You know, say something scary.

5540
04:09:19,620 --> 04:09:25,180
For example, this one time I had a contract to kill a little Nord girl at her birthday party.

5541
04:09:25,540 --> 04:09:27,800
She asked me if I was the jester.

5542
04:09:28,200 --> 04:09:31,460
So I said to her, no, I'm a messenger of death.

5543
04:09:31,980 --> 04:09:34,040
You should have seen the look on her face.

5544
04:09:35,600 --> 04:09:38,080
Anyway, she won't be seeing age six.

5545
04:09:55,660 --> 04:09:58,380
Wait, we're looking for our guy.

5546
04:09:59,220 --> 04:09:59,900
Oh.

5547
04:10:02,240 --> 04:10:04,340
Yeah, he loves his job.

5548
04:10:06,620 --> 04:10:08,060
Hello, my sister.

5549
04:10:08,360 --> 04:10:11,460
Oh, you guys are so right.

5550
04:10:19,290 --> 04:10:21,050
Wait, you guys are...

5551
04:10:21,050 --> 04:10:23,430
You guys are so right.

5552
04:10:24,950 --> 04:10:27,050
Let's not waste time on peasantries.

5553
04:10:27,610 --> 04:10:29,150
Gaston Tussaud is still alive.

5554
04:10:29,370 --> 04:10:31,010
And it's your job to remedy that.

5555
04:10:31,490 --> 04:10:33,450
I suggest you tend to your duties.

5556
04:10:49,350 --> 04:10:50,550
I wish...

5557
04:10:50,550 --> 04:10:51,610
I had never seen this.

5558
04:10:55,090 --> 04:10:55,990
I wish...

5559
04:11:05,050 --> 04:11:06,110
Farewell, sister.

5560
04:11:06,810 --> 04:11:07,390
Farewell.

5561
04:11:13,980 --> 04:11:15,900
Well, it grew back.

5562
04:11:17,100 --> 04:11:20,260
Maybe it's the nostalgia, but I swear he looked better at the original.

5563
04:11:23,180 --> 04:11:24,240
I don't know.

5564
04:11:24,240 --> 04:11:24,340
I don't know.

5565
04:11:24,940 --> 04:11:26,060
But anyways, guys.

5566
04:11:26,380 --> 04:11:27,660
This was a lot of fun.

5567
04:11:27,880 --> 04:11:31,300
I wish to welcome you to this sanctuary, my newest sister.

5568
04:11:31,520 --> 04:11:31,960
Thank you.

5569
04:11:32,340 --> 04:11:32,920
Thank you.

5570
04:11:33,040 --> 04:11:35,000
We'll talk to more of these guys next time.

5571
04:11:35,240 --> 04:11:37,120
I don't know when I'll play next, I'll be honest.

5572
04:11:37,320 --> 04:11:40,040
But probably sooner rather than later since...

5573
04:11:40,040 --> 04:11:41,100
Hello, my sister.

5574
04:11:41,360 --> 04:11:42,380
I'm just talking.

5575
04:11:42,380 --> 04:11:42,960
I'm talking.

5576
04:11:43,120 --> 04:11:43,660
Thanks for the stream.

5577
04:11:43,740 --> 04:11:44,200
Thank you.

5578
04:11:44,840 --> 04:11:47,940
Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life, right?

5579
04:11:51,040 --> 04:11:53,880
I wish to welcome you to this sanctuary, my newest sister.

5580
04:11:54,020 --> 04:11:54,320
Please!

5581
04:11:54,620 --> 04:11:54,900
Please!

5582
04:11:55,220 --> 04:11:56,060
I'm trying to...

5583
04:11:56,060 --> 04:11:57,800
I'm trying to say goodbye to...

5584
04:11:57,800 --> 04:11:59,820
It is an honor to make your acquaintance.

5585
04:11:59,920 --> 04:12:01,060
I want to see where this goes.

5586
04:12:02,440 --> 04:12:04,000
Cannot be accessed without the proper key.

5587
04:12:04,860 --> 04:12:06,220
Wait, I don't have a key?

5588
04:12:06,480 --> 04:12:07,040
But I'm a...

5589
04:12:07,040 --> 04:12:07,800
I'm a sister.

5590
04:12:09,140 --> 04:12:10,160
I'm a sister.

5591
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:12,840
Okay, hold on.

5592
04:12:17,040 --> 04:12:22,260
Same energy as a 40-year-old who went bald early so they buy a hip wig to feel young.

5593
04:12:22,880 --> 04:12:23,920
Thanks for the stream we do.

5594
04:12:24,060 --> 04:12:25,380
I've been enjoying your oblivion streams.

5595
04:12:25,580 --> 04:12:26,180
Thank you!

5596
04:12:27,000 --> 04:12:27,720
Me too.

5597
04:12:27,820 --> 04:12:28,860
These have been so fun.

5598
04:12:29,420 --> 04:12:30,280
I definitely...

5599
04:12:30,280 --> 04:12:33,200
I know this time we didn't do the assassination...

5600
04:12:36,440 --> 04:12:36,920
...quest.

5601
04:12:41,490 --> 04:12:44,810
But we did do this, which I'm happy about.

5602
04:12:44,810 --> 04:12:46,250
Yeah, and then we also joined the Thebes Guild.

5603
04:12:47,930 --> 04:12:48,390
So...

5604
04:12:49,930 --> 04:12:50,710
We did...

5605
04:12:50,710 --> 04:12:52,050
We did get some stuff done.

5606
04:12:52,250 --> 04:12:53,150
Gosh, this place is so...

5607
04:12:53,150 --> 04:12:54,550
Oh my gosh, it's so gothic!

5608
04:12:54,570 --> 04:12:56,010
It's just so pretty!

5609
04:12:56,790 --> 04:12:57,710
I'm obsessed!

5610
04:12:59,070 --> 04:12:59,990
I'm obsessed!

5611
04:13:02,870 --> 04:13:04,330
I love this place!

5612
04:13:06,110 --> 04:13:07,310
I love it!

5613
04:13:07,590 --> 04:13:08,430
I love it!

5614
04:13:08,630 --> 04:13:08,990
I love it so much!

5615
04:13:09,110 --> 04:13:09,950
It's so cute!

5616
04:13:17,530 --> 04:13:18,930
Like a fairytale!

5617
04:13:19,150 --> 04:13:19,430
Truly!

5618
04:13:20,910 --> 04:13:22,930
Yeah, where'd you learn your amazing...

5619
04:13:22,930 --> 04:13:23,690
Stop!

5620
04:13:23,930 --> 04:13:24,970
I almost said it!

5621
04:13:27,030 --> 04:13:27,890
What is it?

5622
04:13:27,890 --> 04:13:28,850
But yeah!

5623
04:13:29,570 --> 04:13:30,050
So...

5624
04:13:30,610 --> 04:13:31,570
We'll do...

5625
04:13:31,570 --> 04:13:33,970
We'll do some other quests next time...

5626
04:13:33,970 --> 04:13:35,730
...before we continue on the main quest.

5627
04:13:36,030 --> 04:13:38,510
So great to see you enjoying all the whack this game has to offer.

5628
04:13:38,830 --> 04:13:39,430
Thank you for this dream!

5629
04:13:39,530 --> 04:13:39,970
Thank you!

5630
04:13:40,370 --> 04:13:41,010
Thank you guys!

5631
04:13:41,490 --> 04:13:44,630
Sorry that we kind of went on a wild goose chase trying to get that ghost.

5632
04:13:45,870 --> 04:13:48,430
But we did do some good exploring too.

5633
04:13:49,610 --> 04:13:50,170
Mmm.

5634
04:13:50,490 --> 04:13:50,870
Mmm.

5635
04:13:52,430 --> 04:13:52,990
Mmm.

5636
04:13:53,310 --> 04:13:53,870
And...

5637
04:13:56,780 --> 04:13:58,480
This was fun!

5638
04:14:00,440 --> 04:14:01,720
Oh, look how cute!

5639
04:14:02,800 --> 04:14:03,360
Oh!

5640
04:14:03,740 --> 04:14:04,840
This is the door to them!

5641
04:14:05,040 --> 04:14:05,320
Wait.

5642
04:14:05,560 --> 04:14:06,460
Is it the Mages Guild?

5643
04:14:09,420 --> 04:14:11,680
I am a Mages Guild member!

5644
04:14:12,160 --> 04:14:13,340
What are you doing?

5645
04:14:13,520 --> 04:14:14,500
Lady in the corner?

5646
04:14:15,160 --> 04:14:15,880
Go ahead, please.

5647
04:14:18,460 --> 04:14:21,320
I understand the Fighters Guild is hiring new members.

5648
04:14:21,320 --> 04:14:23,660
Not bad work for some folks.

5649
04:14:23,840 --> 04:14:24,580
She's possessed.

5650
04:14:24,940 --> 04:14:25,520
Farewell.

5651
04:14:28,000 --> 04:14:28,760
Oh my god!

5652
04:14:29,140 --> 04:14:30,420
Oh my god!

5653
04:14:30,820 --> 04:14:31,920
He's an orphan!

5654
04:14:50,670 --> 04:14:51,390
When

5655
04:14:57,560 --> 04:14:58,740
I'm uncomfortable too!

5656
04:14:59,700 --> 04:15:02,460
I just didn't expect it!

5657
04:15:03,180 --> 04:15:04,460
Okay, I just...

5658
04:15:14,450 --> 04:15:15,110
Ahem!

5659
04:15:15,490 --> 04:15:18,490
Stop laughing at the poor 40-year-old orphan!

5660
04:15:24,610 --> 04:15:25,450
Oh...

5661
04:15:27,920 --> 04:15:28,360
Ah...

5662
04:15:28,360 --> 04:15:29,820
It's so funny, I know!

5663
04:15:30,440 --> 04:15:31,700
I'm sorry!

5664
04:15:33,920 --> 04:15:35,800
It was just so unexpected!

5665
04:15:37,720 --> 04:15:38,560
Yeah...

5666
04:15:38,560 --> 04:15:40,100
Yeah...

5667
04:15:41,660 --> 04:15:42,080
Okay...

5668
04:15:47,180 --> 04:15:47,660
Um...

5669
04:15:47,660 --> 04:15:49,940
But yeah, we'll do much much more too next time!

5670
04:15:51,780 --> 04:15:52,260
Um...

5671
04:15:52,260 --> 04:15:53,500
And, uh...

5672
04:15:54,080 --> 04:15:55,860
Yeah, this was a lot of good fun!

5673
04:15:56,260 --> 04:15:57,500
And, uh...

5674
04:15:58,620 --> 04:16:00,540
The donation alert is frozen on screen!

5675
04:16:00,800 --> 04:16:01,760
Oh, I see it!

5676
04:16:01,960 --> 04:16:03,640
Wait, how long has it been like that?

5677
04:16:05,660 --> 04:16:07,340
How long has it been frozen?

5678
04:16:12,250 --> 04:16:12,790
Uh...

5679
04:16:12,790 --> 04:16:14,690
I've never seen it been frozen before!

5680
04:16:17,030 --> 04:16:18,390
I refreshed it!

5681
04:16:21,410 --> 04:16:22,430
Not that long?

5682
04:16:22,570 --> 04:16:22,990
Okay, good.

5683
04:16:25,070 --> 04:16:25,910
Okay, good.

5684
04:16:27,670 --> 04:16:28,570
But, um...

5685
04:16:28,570 --> 04:16:30,350
Here, let me save here instead.

5686
04:16:33,450 --> 04:16:33,990
Uh...

5687
04:16:33,990 --> 04:16:34,470
New save.

5688
04:16:34,470 --> 04:16:35,310
Okay.

5689
04:16:39,510 --> 04:16:40,090
Cool!

5690
04:16:41,190 --> 04:16:41,590
Uh...

5691
04:16:41,590 --> 04:16:42,710
Money well spent.

5692
04:16:42,890 --> 04:16:43,150
Yeah.

5693
04:16:45,890 --> 04:16:48,080
I wish I could put, like a...

5694
04:16:50,170 --> 04:16:51,090
Like a...

5695
04:16:51,090 --> 04:16:51,310
Hey!

5696
04:16:51,590 --> 04:16:52,890
There's a...

5697
04:16:55,150 --> 04:16:56,050
What the...

5698
04:16:56,050 --> 04:16:56,630
Oh, whoops!

5699
04:16:56,790 --> 04:16:58,630
Oh, there's an oblivion portal right here!

5700
04:16:58,710 --> 04:16:59,670
But I don't think we'll forget.

5701
04:16:59,930 --> 04:17:00,590
Hot dog!

5702
04:17:00,730 --> 04:17:01,310
Hot dog!

5703
04:17:01,470 --> 04:17:04,490
Yeah, next time we'll definitely go and kill the cap...

5704
04:17:04,490 --> 04:17:05,050
Capitan!

5705
04:17:06,170 --> 04:17:08,310
Can I get this one on top of the other...

5706
04:17:10,310 --> 04:17:12,490
I don't know if it would have shown up or not.

5707
04:17:13,090 --> 04:17:14,150
A pin marker!

5708
04:17:14,510 --> 04:17:15,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5709
04:17:16,250 --> 04:17:17,190
Oh, wait, you can!

5710
04:17:17,330 --> 04:17:17,870
I see it!

5711
04:17:18,830 --> 04:17:19,210
Beep!

5712
04:17:19,390 --> 04:17:19,510
Oh.

5713
04:17:20,130 --> 04:17:20,550
Yes.

5714
04:17:21,350 --> 04:17:21,770
What the?

5715
04:17:22,310 --> 04:17:23,810
No, I didn't set it down here.

5716
04:17:24,070 --> 04:17:24,910
Why did it do that?

5717
04:17:25,210 --> 04:17:26,630
No, no, I wanted to set it here.

5718
04:17:27,110 --> 04:17:28,690
Wait, how do I get rid of this one?

5719
04:17:29,410 --> 04:17:29,830
Wait!

5720
04:17:31,730 --> 04:17:32,150
Wait!

5721
04:17:32,790 --> 04:17:33,630
Right here.

5722
04:17:35,050 --> 04:17:35,550
Move it.

5723
04:17:35,950 --> 04:17:36,430
What?

5724
04:17:51,910 --> 04:17:52,390
Oh!

5725
04:17:53,370 --> 04:17:54,130
Oh, wait!

5726
04:17:54,310 --> 04:17:55,370
And now it's here!

5727
04:17:57,850 --> 04:17:58,330
Um...

5728
04:18:00,150 --> 04:18:01,010
Remove it.

5729
04:18:01,950 --> 04:18:03,390
What if I put, like, here?

5730
04:18:04,670 --> 04:18:05,610
Oh, so close.

5731
04:18:05,730 --> 04:18:06,270
Okay, hold on, here.

5732
04:18:06,610 --> 04:18:07,250
Move it.

5733
04:18:07,510 --> 04:18:07,950
Oh!

5734
04:18:08,190 --> 04:18:08,750
I did it!

5735
04:18:10,610 --> 04:18:12,170
Yeah, okay, we...

5736
04:18:15,840 --> 04:18:16,780
That's fine.

5737
04:18:17,380 --> 04:18:18,500
And I haven't even...

5738
04:18:18,500 --> 04:18:22,180
I think I haven't been to, like, most everywhere on the east side.

5739
04:18:23,320 --> 04:18:23,800
So...

5740
04:18:23,800 --> 04:18:24,480
Black Marsh.

5741
04:18:24,840 --> 04:18:25,660
Can we go in there?

5742
04:18:26,080 --> 04:18:27,060
Oh, Morrowind.

5743
04:18:27,140 --> 04:18:27,900
Oh, probably not, right?

5744
04:18:28,020 --> 04:18:28,920
Because there's Skyrim.

5745
04:18:30,020 --> 04:18:30,500
Hammerfell.

5746
04:18:32,900 --> 04:18:33,340
Valenwood.

5747
04:18:35,700 --> 04:18:36,140
Elsewhere.

5748
04:18:38,100 --> 04:18:38,540
Elsewhere.

5749
04:18:39,740 --> 04:18:41,720
But yeah, we have a lot left to explore.

5750
04:18:42,440 --> 04:18:44,260
I haven't been to this place.

5751
04:18:44,600 --> 04:18:45,220
I haven't been...

5752
04:18:45,220 --> 04:18:46,940
I only came here for the first time.

5753
04:18:47,660 --> 04:18:48,700
I haven't been to...

5754
04:18:48,700 --> 04:18:48,940
The...

5755
04:18:48,940 --> 04:18:50,160
Oh, the spire!

5756
04:18:50,340 --> 04:18:51,900
Is that the place that I can...

5757
04:18:52,500 --> 04:18:53,860
Have my home at?

5758
04:18:54,060 --> 04:18:55,320
Oh, I want to go to there.

5759
04:18:57,440 --> 04:19:00,600
We've done a good bit of exploring on the west side, though.

5760
04:19:00,800 --> 04:19:02,360
But I still haven't even been to Anvil.

5761
04:19:02,600 --> 04:19:04,700
There's the whole quest about all the people that...

5762
04:19:06,600 --> 04:19:07,080
Um...

5763
04:19:07,080 --> 04:19:09,000
That were killed in the church.

5764
04:19:09,520 --> 04:19:10,520
Gotta go there.

5765
04:19:12,020 --> 04:19:13,300
So much to do.

5766
04:19:13,600 --> 04:19:15,080
So much to do!

5767
04:19:18,340 --> 04:19:19,540
But, um...

5768
04:19:19,540 --> 04:19:21,560
Look, there's just a little island here.

5769
04:19:24,860 --> 04:19:26,120
We gotta do everything.

5770
04:19:28,920 --> 04:19:30,300
And we'll save that...

5771
04:19:30,300 --> 04:19:31,240
For another time.

5772
04:19:32,800 --> 04:19:33,400
Alrighty!

5773
04:19:33,980 --> 04:19:35,600
The house you can buy in Anvil is...

5774
04:19:36,200 --> 04:19:37,920
Anvil house is also haunted!

5775
04:19:40,960 --> 04:19:43,520
Why didn't you see so sooner?!

5776
04:19:43,520 --> 04:19:44,380
Oh...

5777
04:19:44,380 --> 04:19:45,520
My...

5778
04:19:45,520 --> 04:19:46,020
Gosh!

5779
04:19:46,620 --> 04:19:48,520
I need a haunted house?!

5780
04:19:50,960 --> 04:19:51,560
What?

5781
04:19:51,900 --> 04:19:52,320
Really?

5782
04:19:58,260 --> 04:20:00,060
But you still gotta earn the money.

5783
04:20:00,220 --> 04:20:00,700
I still...

5784
04:20:00,700 --> 04:20:02,480
I have a good amount of money right now.

5785
04:20:05,820 --> 04:20:07,640
Thought you wouldn't want to be spoiled.

5786
04:20:08,420 --> 04:20:08,960
Oh.

5787
04:20:09,220 --> 04:20:10,540
I appreciate that.

5788
04:20:12,340 --> 04:20:12,940
What?

5789
04:20:13,180 --> 04:20:13,340
Five...

5790
04:20:13,340 --> 04:20:14,100
Five thousand?

5791
04:20:19,010 --> 04:20:20,670
We need more quests.

5792
04:20:22,850 --> 04:20:23,450
Okay.

5793
04:20:23,970 --> 04:20:24,690
I'm gonna go now.

5794
04:20:25,350 --> 04:20:25,870
Atsumito!

5795
04:20:26,390 --> 04:20:26,910
Atsumito!

5796
04:20:26,990 --> 04:20:28,290

5797
04:20:28,490 --> 04:20:29,390
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5798
04:20:29,530 --> 04:20:31,510
And I will see you guys next time.

5799
04:20:33,210 --> 04:20:33,510
And...

5800
04:20:33,810 --> 04:20:34,350
Yay!

5801
04:20:37,610 --> 04:20:38,210
Um...

5802
04:20:38,210 --> 04:20:39,530
Yeah, I'm gonna go drink some tea.

5803
04:20:41,050 --> 04:20:41,470
And...

5804
04:20:41,470 --> 04:20:43,070
Eat dinner that's not...

5805
04:20:43,070 --> 04:20:43,910
My pastry.

5806
04:20:44,670 --> 04:20:45,090
Otsumito!

5807
04:20:45,390 --> 04:20:46,050
Itte-rashai!

5808
04:20:46,170 --> 04:20:46,850
Thank you so much guys!

5809
04:20:46,990 --> 04:20:47,350
Thank you!

5810
04:20:47,530 --> 04:20:48,170
Thank you, thank you!

5811
04:20:48,470 --> 04:20:49,210
Bye bye!

5812
04:20:49,470 --> 04:20:51,630
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye!

5813
04:20:51,630 --> 04:20:52,730
Bye bye bye!
