1
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,610
I usually have my...

2
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,660
Back to where I come.

3
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,280
So I was jamming.

4
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,020
It's so good!

5
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,350
One more time!

6
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,930
Dude,

7
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,710
I can't speak.

8
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,450
You deprive us of minto jamming.

9
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,510
There's

10
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,390
your minto jamming.

11
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,270
Building with Legos to recreate minto's cafe.

12
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,330
Now watching minto play Kirby's Dream Land.

13
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,170
Yeah, it was so cute!

14
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,670
Chiquita, oh my gosh!

15
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,630
The Legos, I saw.

16
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,290
I saw, I saw.

17
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,440
This intro song for Kirby's Dream Land is a little shorter than I...

18
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,860
Thought it would be.

19
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,080
So we'll give... I'll talk less and we'll get into the game soon.

20
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,400
Alright, you know what?

21
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,180
I could just turn it down a little bit.

22
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,740
Because I was listening to it and I was like, oh...

23
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,460
This is like...

24
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,900
Really short.

25
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,680
But anyway, hello everybody!

26
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,560
Hi!

27
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,980
I hope you're having a good weekend so far.

28
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,080
And...

29
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,620
Um...

30
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,090
Oh yeah, I'm playing Kirby's Dream Land today.

31
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,070
Um, I know it's a short game.

32
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,710
Everybody has told me.

33
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,610
Everybody in the world has said this stream's gonna be like 15 minutes.

34
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,010
Well, what if...

35
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,050
Well, what if...

36
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm really bad?

37
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,710
Nah, even if it's a short stream, I was like, you know...

38
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,330
I, um...

39
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,030
I did karaoke the other day and then I did a collab yesterday.

40
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,330
So I could...

41
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,190
Okay, 17 minutes.

42
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,390
15 hour stream!

43
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,210
Um, but...

44
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,330
So I was like, you know...

45
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,530
I'll just take it easy.

46
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,370
I'll take it easy here.

47
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,770
How's your throat doing?

48
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,310
After that singing marathon?

49
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,410
Singing marathon?

50
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,790
My throat's good actually.

51
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,470
It was hurting a lot last night.

52
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,130
But I woke up and it was all good.

53
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:05,550
Cool!

54
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,690
Definitely best place to start as it predates the copy ability.

55
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,110
Yeah, I know that too.

56
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,630
I know that too.

57
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,830
So we don't get any abilities in this game.

58
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,530
But that's okay!

59
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,110
You know me, I like to appreciate things as they evolve.

60
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,030
And where they start and come from, so...

61
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,310
Hmm.

62
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,450
So you know, the game is pretty short.

63
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,010
I can't tell if this is sarcasm or...

64
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,010
Or not.

65
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,910
Oh, really?

66
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,290
I didn't know the game was short.

67
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,250
Oh.

68
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,790
Kirby series was my childhood.

69
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,630
I hope you enjoy the game.

70
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,290
Thank you!

71
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,630
If Kirby ate Minto, what ability would he gain?

72
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,310
Um...

73
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,230
Is it only one?

74
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,570
Does Kirby only ever get one ability?

75
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,350
When he...

76
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,570
When he sucks...

77
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,230
The power.

78
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,150
Apparently wearing my mint shirt.

79
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:54,970
So cute!

80
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,370
How's he sitting on an ice cream?

81
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,290
Cute!

82
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,350
Guess one.

83
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,050
One?

84
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,390
A bit.

85
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,490
Depends on the game.

86
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,010
Hi, game.

87
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,890
I just wanted to make sure he's a bit too short.

88
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:10,530
No!

89
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,970
Game is short, but so is Bito.

90
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,050
So you probably won't notice...

91
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,170
Why?

92
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,930
Two of you at the same time have the same idea.

93
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,650
What are you conspiring against me?

94
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,870
But, okay.

95
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,990
One ability.

96
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,470
What would be my greatest ability?

97
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,410
Maybe Moe Moe Beam.

98
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,490
I think that's very powerful, no?

99
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:37,930
No?

100
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,590
Maybe you end up liking this...

101
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:42,930
Game?

102
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,130
I should let you know that someone made a Kirby-style Toll game...

103
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,470
Called Sanai's...

104
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,450
Silphid Breeze.

105
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:49,770
Oh!

106
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,630
I didn't know about that.

107
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,070
Thank you.

108
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,110
Got my desktop...

109
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,530
Desk...

110
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,310
Desk...

111
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,710
Mat...

112
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,990
Minto!

113
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,290
Just so you know, it's long.

114
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,950
Is it long?

115
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,670
Actually, wait.

116
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,710
I did get that too.

117
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,150
I just never put it on my desk.

118
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,670
Cause I'm waiting on a Koharu.

119
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,390
What?

120
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,270
MintoGamerSubs!

121
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,710
We'll be here Monday!

122
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,170
Wow!

123
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,270
Everything's coming in!

124
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,270
Thank you guys for ordering.

125
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:15,890
Thank you!

126
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,070
Frosty Trooper Welcome to Membu Ship!

127
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,210
Did you guys see that there's new Membu?

128
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,670
New Membu...

129
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,350
Icons?

130
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,970
Except for...

131
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,750
The one year.

132
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,670
I kept that one.

133
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,950
They're a little new now!

134
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,030
There is one for two years, so...

135
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,790
I have not seen one.

136
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,090
Hmm...

137
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,550
Maybe I will see one...

138
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,170
Eventually...

139
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,050
Hmm...

140
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,650
Hmm...

141
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,410
Hmm...

142
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,230
Okay...

143
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,720
Yes, yes, yes.

144
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,300
Thank you, thanks for the gifter!

145
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,800
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,160
Herbie's Dreamline is short, but if you feel like it, thankfully...

147
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,660
The sequels are on Nintendo Online.

148
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,600
Oh, I won't do them today, but yeah.

149
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,520
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,440
Really glad to have found you last year.

151
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
One of the...

152
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,720
First VTubers I watched and congratulations...

153
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,220
Watch and congratulations on five years!

154
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,120
Thank you!

155
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,180
Thank you so much!

156
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,420
Good!

157
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,600
Yeah, so now there...

158
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Yeah, some of you are just a box...

159
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,180
Some of you are ribbons...

160
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,600
Very cute!

161
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,460
Uh, those were made by...

162
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,080
These were made by Crone...

163
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Um...

164
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,360
I was gonna have them...

165
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,180
During my...

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,400
Uh...

167
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,800
Uh...

168
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,740
I was gonna debut them later, but...

169
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,360
I don't know, whatever.

170
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,160
I was being sarcastic when I said the game is short.

171
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,860
It is though.

172
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,740
Just so you know.

173
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay.

174
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,280
Really?

175
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,280
I had no idea.

176
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,120
Also, did you guys know that...

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,080
Jaeger means hunter?

178
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,760
In German?

179
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,940
I have a question though.

180
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,040
Why is Kirby...

181
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,820
Why is Kirby...

182
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,220
Like a ghost...

183
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,920
On the...

184
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,560
On the cover of this game?

185
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,190
You guys can now flex your knowledge...

186
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,300
Because I am asking.

187
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,480
You know Kirby was supposed to be in Resident Evil 4?

188
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,360
Yeah.

189
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,660
He's a white Kirby.

190
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,900
He's drained of all of his...

191
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,460
Color.

192
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,460
He...

193
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
It's...

194
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,100
Don't...

195
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,220
Wait.

196
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,980
Let me guess.

197
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,560
Let me guess.

198
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,120
Kirby did not eat enough shrimp.

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,540
His color was undecided before the game's release.

200
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,300
Uh...

201
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,500
He was white before pink was canonized.

202
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,180
Yes.

203
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,180
You nailed it.

204
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
He's a flamingo.

205
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,780
He's a flamingo.

206
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,200
Kirby's not a flamingo?

207
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,460
No, I think we just established here.

208
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,260
I think we just established that.

209
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,460
He's pink in the Japanese cover?

210
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,700
No way!

211
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,340
The color pink wasn't invented yet.

212
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,520
Oh...

213
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,340
I see...

214
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,780
Friend-shaped game time with...

215
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,000
Friend-shaped Minto.

216
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,040
Am I friend-shaped?

217
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,970
What if Kirby was a ghost though?

218
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,050
That would have been really exciting.

219
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,650
Actually, I really like...

220
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,490
Meta Knight.

221
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,950
So, don't tell me what game he comes out in.

222
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,910
But I really want to meet him.

223
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,890
I'm really looking forward to...

224
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,590
To him.

225
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,430
You're Minto-shaped.

226
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,790
Which is very cool.

227
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,010
Limited colors of OG Game Boy 2.

228
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,770
Yeah, I'm using the...

229
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,930
The Game Boy Color Filter.

230
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,990
Yeah, because I...

231
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,170
You know...

232
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,350
Usually, I'm like...

233
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,490
All about the accuracy.

234
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,850
But I felt it would just look ugly on stream.

235
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,250
So...

236
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,330
So...

237
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,810
That's why we're playing the...

238
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,150
Color...

239
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,130
Game Boy Color version.

240
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,150
I decided that.

241
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,570
That was my executive decision.

242
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,990
When do we watch...

243
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,650
The Kirby anime?

244
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,170
I don't know.

245
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,230
Gosh, I have so much stuff to watch already.

246
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,460
You're gonna love it when he shows up.

247
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:36,880
He's a...

248
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,780
He's a badass.

249
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,880
I can't wait.

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,580
I love his design so much.

251
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,060
I think he's really cool.

252
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,360
So I hope I like him.

253
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,920
I hope he's not like a little punk.

254
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,440
Well, I would still love him if he...

255
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,060
Even if he is a little punk.

256
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,600
I love little punks too.

257
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,800
Yeah, he does have such a great design.

258
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,680
He's so cool.

259
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,180
Not Kirby related, but did you see the Hatsune Miku nonogram game is on?

260
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:05,700
Steve!

261
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,260
It is!

262
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,420
Since when?

263
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,380
Uh oh.

264
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,080
Are we gonna be doing more nonograms?

265
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,160
Is Meta Knight the ocelot of the Kirby mythos?

266
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,640
I don't know anything.

267
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,240
No s...

268
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,000
No s...

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,520
Is there spoilers for Kirby?

270
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,120
I don't know.

271
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,260
The 25th it came out.

272
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,400
What?

273
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,340
Hold on.

274
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,280
Hatsune Miku!

275
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,740
Logic Paint!

276
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,000
Wow!

277
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,880
It's...

278
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,300
Fifteen dollars!

279
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,300
Holy moly.

280
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you for always keeping us entertained.

281
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,120
Happy belated anniversary!

282
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,460
Thank you!

283
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,480
Wait...

284
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,040
Oh my gosh.

285
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,540
Rockbiter!

286
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Thank you so much for the welcome.

287
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,780
Super thank you!

288
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,220
I really appreciate it.

289
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

290
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,640
Yeah...

291
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,140
Yeah, sorry, I just wanted to chit-chat a bit before we...

292
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,220
Before we started, sorry.

293
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Now I'm watching Hatsune Miku...

294
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,280
Logic Paint S...

295
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,740
Plus...

296
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,400
What are you...

297
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,320
Oh, you can like decorate them?

298
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,240
Wait, this is so...

299
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,700
Oh, and there's like songs!

300
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,740
Oh no...

301
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,380
My channel will get taken down.

302
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,420
Please...

303
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,860
Hatsune...

304
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,480
John Hatsune Miku...

305
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,700
Please don't take down my channel...

306
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,980
For listening to Vocaloid music.

307
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,850
Hmm...

308
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,650
It's a pretty good game.

309
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,110
What the Miku one?

310
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,570
You know, usually I don't play...

311
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,890
Nonograms that...

312
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,330
That punish you...

313
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,110
For making a mistake, you know?

314
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,430
So...

315
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,330
You know...

316
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:56,810
But...

317
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,270
But...

318
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,670
That was when I first started...

319
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,430
Using...

320
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,430
Playing Nonograms...

321
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,670
I probably could do it now...

322
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,930
Kirby actually has very deep lore...

323
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,510
If you go look...

324
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,890
Isn't Kirby like a god?

325
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,870
Kirby...

326
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,670
Because he's...

327
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,070
Uh...

328
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,070
Sakurai's baby...

329
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,990
So he's...

330
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,990
He is...

331
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,030
God...

332
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,710
Basically...

333
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,810
I'm...

334
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,430
With...

335
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,470
Yeah...

336
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,770
Eldritch being...

337
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,130
Just wanted to say...

338
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,690
Thank you boss...

339
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,670
For playing Kirby's Dream Land...

340
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,230
I first had this game long ago...

341
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,890
When it first came out on the original game board...

342
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,350
And it brought me five memories...

343
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,190
Of course!

344
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,570
You can always count on me playing an old game.

345
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,670
I've never done an Aquasipa before, but if it's anyone that I think deserves the first, maybe you.

346
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,210
Happy late for the anniversary, too.

347
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,230
Thank you for continuing on.

348
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,890
You're all the ups and downs, no matter what.

349
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,310
You don't know you have us behind your back.

350
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,210
Thank you!

351
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,430
Oh, my gosh.

352
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,350
Don't for P.S.

353
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,530
Thank you so much.

354
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,830
Thank you.

355
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,830
First ever, too.

356
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,770
I really appreciate it.

357
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,530
Thank you.

358
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

359
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,690
Hot dog, indeed.

360
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,790
Gameboy color is a good choice.

361
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,050
Can you imagine having to stare at green and white stuff the whole stream?

362
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,170
P.U.

363
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,850
Who wants to stare at anything green and white?

364
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,030
You are the cutest patootie in the world, shape.

365
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,070
Herbie is like an eldritch beating but filled with friendship energy instead of evil energy.

366
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,470
I mean...

367
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,070
If...

368
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,930
I mean, look at...

369
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,090
Look at... Did you just see him go...

370
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,110
How?

371
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,990
And... And become...

372
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:56,990
Big and... How?

373
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,670
How?

374
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,470
Just there, there, there, there.

375
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:58,790
You see?

376
00:17:59,290 --> 00:17:59,690
How?

377
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,710
Um... Also, guys...

378
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,410
Sorry, I just realized...

379
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,180
I'm playing through OBS, so...

380
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,250
Don't... Don't... Don't attack me, okay?

381
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,630
I'm the only one whose chat's delayed.

382
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,850
I don't know.

383
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,830
Chat, are you delayed?

384
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,280
Classic minto gaming.

385
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,820
I'm too lazy to change my monitor.

386
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,320
Especially because sometimes it, like, rearranges my...

387
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,340
Windows.

388
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,320
And that's just a pain in the butt.

389
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,260
But...

390
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,400
I could play it on my tiny monitor.

391
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,400
What if I did that?

392
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,460
That'd be insane.

393
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,600
If I played the whole game on my teeny tiny monitor...

394
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,020
That has...

395
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,100
You know, it's not a...

396
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,740
It's not a chat monitor anymore.

397
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,300
It's been downgraded to clock.

398
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,660
It is now my clock...

399
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,880
Clock-iter.

400
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,320
My clock monitor.

401
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,020
I

402
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,600
can have three wallpapers.

403
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,920
And I think that's kind of nifty.

404
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,420
For...

405
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,340
Decorating purposes.

406
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,180
You are the friendliest ghost since Casper.

407
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,320
What?

408
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm not friendly at all.

409
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm spooky scary.

410
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,780
Tiny monitor for authenticity.

411
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,640
DDD theme slash...

412
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,260
Is he...

413
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,060
Is King...

414
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,380
Is King Dedede, right?

415
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,200
Is he in this game?

416
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,780
Well...

417
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,240
Don't tell me.

418
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,220
No spoilers.

419
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,440
Let's get started.

420
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,540
Let's play the game.

421
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,560
I've yapped for...

422
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,360
Long enough.

423
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,960
You're a ghost?

424
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,760
Yeah...

425
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,490
Or...

426
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,070
I'm your paralysis demon.

427
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,810
It's spooky scary how friendly you are.

428
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,110
Oh my gosh.

429
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,270
I recently got into watching VTubers, right?

430
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,390
After playing the entire Metal Gear series for the first time.

431
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,410
After discovering your streams and love for MGS, I quickly became a fan!

432
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Love your singing and can't wait to watch you for many years to come.

433
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,040
What the heck?

434
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,900
What the heck?

435
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,240
A camp intro.

436
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,180
Thank you!

437
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,340
Oh my gosh!

438
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,060
What the heck?

439
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,900
You're already here for years?

440
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,400
You just got into VTubers?

441
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,020
And you're saying you can't wait to watch for years?

442
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,360
Uh oh.

443
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,720
I think someone fell down the hole pretty hard.

444
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,660
I really appreciate it.

445
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,420
Thank you!

446
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,520
I love that people find...

447
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,860
I love...

448
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,960
That's my favorite thing.

449
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,800
So when people find me through Metal Gear.

450
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,540
Because then I can...

451
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,120
I can talk more about...

452
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,100
It gives me an excuse to talk more about Metal Gear.

453
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,080
I can...

454
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,520
Like I have an opportunity.

455
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm just like...

456
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,340
Oh!

457
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,900
You found me through Metal Gear?

458
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,700
I'm gonna...

459
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
I'm gonna...

460
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,620
Unleash her freak.

461
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,220
Oh yeah, baby.

462
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,840
Oh yeah.

463
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,200
That was me.

464
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,480
I found you through Metal Gear?

465
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,360
Happy!

466
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,720
Happy, happy, happy!

467
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,460
Can't wait for people to find you after Delta.

468
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,970
I wonder how...

469
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm so...

470
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,860
I'm nervous how Delta will go.

471
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,820
Nervously optimistic, but...

472
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,300
MGS Con in less than a month, by the way.

473
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,060
I know!

474
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,740
I know...

475
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,200
I know...

476
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,980
I'm...

477
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,520
I will be working MGS Con, so...

478
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,300
No chatter here.

479
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Can you explain...

480
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:00,820
What...

481
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,900
What Gear Metal?

482
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,600
Sonic Mayhem!

483
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,580
Welcome to Metal Ship!

484
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,180
Thank you!

485
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,100
I pray for the day I wake up paralyzed with mint on...

486
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,460
On...

487
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,800
On...

488
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,000
On...

489
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,280
On...

490
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,480
On...

491
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,320
On...

492
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,080
Hope you have good streams with this pink demon.

493
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,100
Thank you!

494
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,460
Alright, we should get started.

495
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,640
I said that...

496
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,540
Five minutes ago.

497
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,400
Let...

498
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,700
Um...

499
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,380
Okay, gosh.

500
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,920
It's been a second since I've played...

501
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,440
Last game I played...

502
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,900
On my Switch was...

503
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,580
Fantasy Life.

504
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,520
And it's been a minute since I've used a Joy-Con, so...

505
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,080
I have to...

506
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
You know when you have to like, reconfigure...

507
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,100
Which one is A and which one is B?

508
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,160
After...

509
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,560
After using like...

510
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:01,920
My...

511
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,560
I have my other controller...

512
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,600
I might...

513
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,880
I might mess it up a bit.

514
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,020
Guys, guys.

515
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,660
Welcome to Metal Ship.

516
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,180
The Haku!

517
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,780
Witty message.

518
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,440
Hehe.

519
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,860
I laugh at your witty message.

520
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,580
I found you through the cryptic messages of an ancient mountain oracle.

521
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,220
Hope the part about you being a dark omen isn't real.

522
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, Chovec.

523
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,660
I finally started my Metal Gear journey.

524
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,360
Thanks to you!

525
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,980
Just finished MG...

526
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,780
Metal Gear 2.

527
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,440
Metal Gear Solid Waze.

528
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:36,720
Oh!

529
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,720
You started with the Metal Gear series.

530
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,020
I say series.

531
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,300
Metal Gear...

532
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,980
Games.

533
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,400
Made it home.

534
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,020
You can start now.

535
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Oh my gosh!

536
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,980
Grimble, thank you.

537
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,420
Finally.

538
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,680
I was waiting for you to get home.

539
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,440
Okay, let's start.

540
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,500
Can I turn the music back up?

541
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,460
Start.

542
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,000
Green?

543
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:57,780
Greens?

544
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,100
Oh my god, he's getting attacked by those...

545
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,950
I know the song!

546
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,550
Wait, I know the song!

547
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,650
Oh, I can suck.

548
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,050
Oh, and I can fly!

549
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:18,650
Okay.

550
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,790
How do I stop flying?

551
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,430
Kirby?

552
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,190
Oh, that's him.

553
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,710
Oh wait, if so, if I...

554
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,610
If I...

555
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:25,910
Wait.

556
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,010
If I...

557
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,110
Wait.

558
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,630
Oh damn!

559
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,080
Oh shoot!

560
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,760
Oh no!

561
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,440
Is that bird gonna kill me?

562
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,440
Yeah.

563
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,340
Okay, birds are...

564
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,620
Birds are an obstacle.

565
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,460
Oh dang.

566
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,160
Okay.

567
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,280
Come here!

568
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,900
Come here bird!

569
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,840
Where are you?

570
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,420
Oh!

571
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,160
Oh my gosh!

572
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,840
Wait, you're not gonna come anymore?

573
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,300
Ah!

574
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,240
Nevermind!

575
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,680
You hate me?

576
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,270
Come here!

577
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,250
Oh, I can't fly because I'm...

578
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,010
Too fat!

579
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,730
Come in.

580
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,580
Oh!

581
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Which way should we go?

582
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,480
Wait, is this gonna poison me?

583
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,360
Okay, no.

584
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,020
I know these games.

585
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,480
I know you can go in or you can go beyond.

586
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,390
Oh my goodness.

587
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,830
This area is...

588
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,870
Who the hell is that jolly fella?

589
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,370
There's so much...

590
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:39,710
There's so much...

591
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,170
Why are there so many guys here?

592
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,610
Wait!

593
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,090
Wait!

594
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,750
Wait, no, no.

595
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,290
Wait.

596
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,550
Let me in.

597
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,270
Whoa!

598
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,190
Okay.

599
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,770
I suck the bombs.

600
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,730
I suck your bombs.

601
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,570
And then I shoot your bomb.

602
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:01,810
Come here.

603
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:01,830
What?

604
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,530
What?

605
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,290
What?

606
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,200
What?

607
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,340
Stupid.

608
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,210
Nice.

609
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,090
Oh, shoot.

610
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,930
Oh no!

611
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,010
I wasted my...

612
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,510
Can I eat big things too?

613
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,430
Oh my god!

614
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:36,610
What?

615
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,670
Oh.

616
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,210
I lost it though.

617
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,270
I can eat everything I want!

618
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,250
This is insane!

619
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,350
What the hell?

620
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,970
This is a black hole.

621
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,030
Wait, what are these?

622
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,110
Do these do anything?

623
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,810
This even sounds like a vacuum though.

624
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,310
Oh!

625
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,400
That enemy was bigger than me!

626
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,040
I know!

627
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,380
Look at him go.

628
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,540
And then I'm gonna eat him.

629
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,460
And then I'm gonna do that.

630
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,360
And then I'm gonna eat him.

631
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,740
Wait.

632
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,000
I stripped him.

633
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,180
I'm trying to...

634
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,780
Figure out.

635
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,040
How do I...

636
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,250
How do I float?

637
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,870
Oh, it's up!

638
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,450
Okay, okay.

639
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:42,910
Thank you.

640
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Go in.

641
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,400
No.

642
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,680
Go inside.

643
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,210
Eat cow.

644
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,830
It's just like real life.

645
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,560
It's just like real life.

646
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,240
You eat the cow.

647
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,410
These guys are so...

648
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,030
Funny.

649
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,130
Wait.

650
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:26,870
Wait!

651
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,470
Oh!

652
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,230
I got my health back.

653
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:32,850
Let's go.

654
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,430
Ice skating.

655
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:35,950
Oops.

656
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:36,410
Oh.

657
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,610
That was close.

658
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,890
Haha.

659
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,590
I just like to kill for fun.

660
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,050
I don't even need to go up here, do I?

661
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:48,750
Nah.

662
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,050
Eat that bird.

663
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,420
You press up a...

664
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:55,550
Call?

665
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,450
Switches to hard boat.

666
00:28:59,250 --> 00:28:59,530
Nah!

667
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,650
Then why would I go to hard boat my first time playing?

668
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,290
Yeah, I enjoyed all the killing.

669
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:06,350
No.

670
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,130
Am I going the right way?

671
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,270
Uh...

672
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,610
Kirby?

673
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,890
Kirby, you're trapped.

674
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,910
Oh, everybody's back now.

675
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,010
I might have made a...

676
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:18,970
I might have messed up.

677
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,680
Oh, come on.

678
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,240
Come on, come on, come on.

679
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,340
Ouch.

680
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,870
What if I go through here?

681
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,350
Wait, what is this...

682
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,730
What is the point of where I'm at?

683
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,830
Wait.

684
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,310
Oh, there's a door right here.

685
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:39,990
I'm an idiot.

686
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,390
Sorry.

687
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,550
I could not see.

688
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,920
Special music.

689
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,160
Oh my gosh.

690
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,080
Okay,

691
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,880
okay, you hurt me.

692
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,560
You hurt, you hurt.

693
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,960
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

694
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:04,900
Wait.

695
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,300
I

696
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,540
died so fast.

697
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,460
What?

698
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,420
Oh, okay, okay.

699
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:23,950
Okay.

700
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,440
Yeah!

701
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,080
Give me your apples.

702
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,580
I destroyed the giving tree.

703
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,860
This is literally the story of the giving tree, you guys.

704
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,880
He gives me apples and I kill him.

705
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,830
Let's go.

706
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,940
Stage two!

707
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:56,980
Ooh!

708
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,400
Castle a lo-lo-lo-lo.

709
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Let a girl...

710
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,800
Let a girl get into the game first.

711
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,960
Let a girl read her chat.

712
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,700
Wait.

713
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,020
Kirby takes fall damage?

714
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,550
There's a mic there.

715
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,430
Kirby a streamer.

716
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,710
What's this do?

717
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,020
That's what I do.

718
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,020
I blow out your eardrums.

719
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,040
Stop, so cute.

720
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,140
Precious!

721
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,660
Oh, whoa, whoa.

722
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,940
I can...

723
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,140
Even I can tell that's dangerous!

724
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,320
Okay, never mind.

725
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,220
You can't kill it.

726
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,340
Oh, my God.

727
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,800
That's just a bomb.

728
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,780
Isn't this place full of such whimsy and joy?

729
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,080
You got bombs...

730
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,660
And ghosts.

731
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,660
It's just a little silly.

732
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,530
It's kind of freaking me out.

733
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,390
Okay.

734
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,700
I think we need more whimsy, if anything.

735
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,460
What the heck is that?

736
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,260
Hi, I'm the...

737
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,970
Oh, my gosh, wait!

738
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,810
I can't suck!

739
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,630
No, no, no, no, no!

740
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,030
Ouch!

741
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,390
Oh, I sucked the wrong way.

742
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm speed running.

743
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,520
Oh, no.

744
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,480
Oh, no, no, no, no.

745
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,060
Wait.

746
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,660
Wait, you were supposed to go in the order!

747
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,720
Okay, there he is.

748
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,060
Let's see.

749
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,580
Okay.

750
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,480
Oh, maybe he does it three times.

751
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:37,920
Nope.

752
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,660
You know what?

753
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,380
I'm just gonna go inside.

754
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,340
Never mind, I can't do that.

755
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,540
Is this a boss?

756
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,060
No.

757
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,280
Hello?

758
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,940
He's coming to me!

759
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,640
Oh,

760
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:07,810
okay.

761
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,370
Just kidding.

762
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,570
Sorry, I was... I was all blown up.

763
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,890
Come here!

764
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,110
Did I get him?

765
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,030
I can't even tell if I did or not.

766
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,080
Maybe getting one of...

767
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,160
Oh.

768
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,580
Maybe getting one of the guys...

769
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,210
Oh!

770
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,910
Just jump up the things instead.

771
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,440
Oh, whoops.

772
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,930
Jumping was even an option, I'm not gonna lie.

773
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,110
I forgot it wasn't even an option.

774
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,210
Because I'm just so used to flying now.

775
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,330
Can I suck this up?

776
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,250
No?

777
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,720
Wait, anything down here?

778
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,590
Yeah, I learned how to fly and I forgot how to jump.

779
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,050
So true.

780
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,690
Hey!

781
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:57,870
Ouch.

782
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,650
I can have...

783
00:35:59,650 --> 00:35:59,810
Wait.

784
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,490
This is kinda fancy.

785
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:02,910
Nice.

786
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,970
Nice warm meal.

787
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,180
Am I back to normal?

788
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:25,840
Dang.

789
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,250
Spikey.

790
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,930
Okay.

791
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,810
Please.

792
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,590
There was nothing here.

793
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,420
Forgot the curry was a thing.

794
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,280
How could you forget?

795
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,360
Get out of here.

796
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,630
Let's see.

797
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,550
I want to explore, but...

798
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:22,930
Okay.

799
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,130
I'm going in here.

800
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,310
Oh, it's this stinking mask.

801
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:33,890
Yes.

802
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,480
No!

803
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,360
I don't like him.

804
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,480
Okay.

805
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,560
Okay, wrong door, I guess.

806
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:52,880
Okay.

807
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,600
I understand.

808
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,520
They're like, hey, stupid.

809
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,100
Wrong place.

810
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

811
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,260
Maybe this door.

812
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,440
Okay.

813
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,120
Wrong door number two.

814
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,460
Oh, my bad.

815
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,680
Okay.

816
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
I don't think that's a maid.

817
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,020
I think that is a witch.

818
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:27,920
No?

819
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,360
It's pretty witch-like, I'd say.

820
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,660
Yeah.

821
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,700
Oh, my God.

822
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,540
Oh, my God.

823
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,180
Don't pit me, please.

824
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,800
They're cleaning.

825
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,260
With their broomstick.

826
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,580
That is a witch broomstick.

827
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,400
Oh, these guys again.

828
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,020
Okay, okay.

829
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:55,960
Ow!

830
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,520
I shot it at you!

831
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,000
You son of a bitch!

832
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,200
Oh!

833
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,500
Oh, I get it.

834
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:02,700
Okay.

835
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,720
I get it.

836
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,120
I get it.

837
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,800
Guys.

838
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,240
And then you can only jump down and up from here.

839
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,280
Oh, my gosh.

840
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:11,460
Wait.

841
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Wait.

842
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,200
Can you jump here?

843
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,160
You can't.

844
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,420
Okay.

845
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:18,960
Yeah.

846
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,340
Okay.

847
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:19,680
Okay.

848
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:21,860
Okay.

849
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,490
Okay.

850
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,390
I need to...

851
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:44,650
Actually!

852
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,870
Jump down!

853
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:46,490
Okay.

854
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,530
Suck from behind.

855
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,310
I can do that?

856
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,510
Oh.

857
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,190
Oh, shoot.

858
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,910
Uh.

859
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,670
It didn't work.

860
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,230
I need to stop pressing up.

861
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,390
Wait.

862
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,150
Where'd your thing go?

863
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:05,750
Where'd your thing go?

864
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,270
Have to be closer to them.

865
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:13,490
Okay.

866
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:13,670
Okay.

867
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,190
Wait.

868
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,280
I'm trying to get a...

869
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,420
Okay.

870
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:18,760
Here we go.

871
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
here we go.

872
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,170
Yeah!

873
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,200
I discovered!

874
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,100
Uh.

875
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,540
Just kidding.

876
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,620
Dang it, I'm so slow.

877
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,940
I'm too slow!

878
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Outsmarted, idiot.

879
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,890
I'm ready to suck.

880
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,110
I was not ready to suck.

881
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,930
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

882
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,130
If only I had...

883
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,770
Maybe I just keep it in my mouth.

884
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,030
Until they come back.

885
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,700
Oh, shoot!

886
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,160
Okay.

887
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,700
Wait, can I...

888
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,360
Wait, I'm just holding it in now.

889
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,580
Wait, can you guys...

890
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,980
You guys are like getting in the worst position for me.

891
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,340
Okay.

892
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,240
There we go.

893
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,440
Okay.

894
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,480
I pressed the wrong button.

895
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:54,940
My bad.

896
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
You guys, if I die...

897
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
I'm gonna have to redo everything, aren't I?

898
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm gonna die.

899
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,960
I don't wanna die.

900
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,860
I don't wanna die.

901
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,390
Oh, please.

902
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,990
Three more and all...

903
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,380
Drop and sh...

904
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,480
Where did it go?

905
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,460
Wait a second!

906
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,540
Oh...

907
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,670
Where did it go?

908
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,670
I swallowed it?

909
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,090
How?

910
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,210
Oh, that's so icky.

911
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,390
That's so...

912
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,050
How did I eat it?

913
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,170
Wait, did I at least get health for it?

914
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,530
You eat it if you press down.

915
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,110
What?

916
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,510
Okay, well...

917
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,210
Die and learn, I suppose.

918
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,190
Hey!

919
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,190
Stupid?

920
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,670
Alright.

921
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,410
Says me.

922
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,730
I'm the stupid one here.

923
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,270
Sorry.

924
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,240
I'm the stupid one here.

925
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:21,920
Sorry.

926
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,880
Really toughie here.

927
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,220
Holy cow.

928
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:27,660
Okay.

929
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,740
One...

930
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,940
One sibling destroyed!

931
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,160
I'm guessing they're siblings?

932
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,980
Unless they're married, that would be pretty sad.

933
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:45,780
Oh.

934
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,620
Damnit.

935
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,240
That was unfortunate.

936
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,420
I killed his wife?

937
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,360
Oh, I killed the girlfriend?

938
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,240
Rovers.

939
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Oh, I like a tragic love story.

940
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,380
Look, now he's crying.

941
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,200
Now he's crying as he runs around.

942
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,460
Okay.

943
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,630
Go into a spot... Here we go.

944
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,470
Okay.

945
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,330
I won't... Wait.

946
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,490
Will I eat it now?

947
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:19,930
I don't know.

948
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,190
Please come this way.

949
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,130
No!

950
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,680
Oh my gosh.

951
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,020
Come back here, please!

952
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,200
Please!

953
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:36,480
Please!

954
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:36,760
Please!

955
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:36,920
Please!

956
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Please!

957
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:37,320
Please!

958
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,500
Please!

959
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Please!

960
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Please!

961
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Please!

962
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Please!

I'm so sweaty.

1065
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,860
Ah, look at that flapping fish.

1066
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,500
I just got a girlfriend!

1067
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,720
Which means you just got a girlfriend!

1068
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,300

Great sucking, boss.

Thank you.

1074
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,020
I wish I could get more life, but...

1075
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,180
Oh yeah, we're eating squid tonight.

1076
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,400
What the hell is that?

1077
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,360
Merry Happy Birthday!

1078
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,740
Eating sushi as I have for the last three years.

1079
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,260
Nice.

1080
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,740
Quit that!

1081
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,560
Freak!

1082
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,040
Wait, does this guy do the same thing?

1083
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,060
How does he get a selfie?

1084
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,540
Oh wait!

1085
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,080
I recognize this thing!

1086
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,820
Thank you so much!

1087
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,480
Thank you!

1088
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,480
Wait, I recognize this guy!

1089
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,420
I think?

1090
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,700
Oh, shoot.

1091
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,520
Let's go.

1092
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,420
Oh, okay.

1093
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,340
Oh, watch out for that.

1094
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,460
Okay, alright.

1095
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,880
I'm watching out.

1096
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,740
Oh my god.

1097
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,560
Oh my god!

1098
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,420
Ouch, ouch!

1099
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,220

00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,100

1101
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:58,820
I'm just...

1102
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,540
Oh my god!

1103
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,280
Everything's trying to kill me!

1104
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,180
What?

1105
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,100
I don't...

1106
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,360
Why does everybody hate Kirby?

1107
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,060
What did he...

1108
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:11,660
Oh my god.

1109
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,140
Oh my god.

1110
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:12,760
Oh my god.

1111
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,780
What did he do?

1112
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,280
No, please.

1113
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,160
Please, god, no.

1114
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:16,560
Please.

1115
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,160
Oh my god.

1116
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,640
Please, no.

1117
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,620
Use the... Use the scream!

1118
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,320
Use the scream!

1119
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,580
He ate their families.

1120
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,080
You know what?

1121
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,760
I believe that.

1122
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,600
This is messed up.

1123
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,070
There we go.

1124
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,450
Okay.

1125
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,830
This is an actual hat.

1126
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,610
That wasn't my fault.

1127
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,270
That wasn't my fault.

1128
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,830
That wasn't my fault.

1129
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,470
That wasn't my...

1130
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,730
Oh my...

1131
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,020
Someone hates me.

1132
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:08,940
For real.

1133
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,800
Okay.

1134
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:14,800
Whoa!

1135
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,460
Whoa, buddy.

1136
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,080
Why does it look like those spikes are gonna kill me?

1137
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,320
I didn't get killed by spikes.

1138
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,620
I got killed by...

1139
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,860
The Moai instead.

1140
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,980
The delay makes you stronger.

1141
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:33,980
Yeah!

1142
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:34,840
That's right.

1143
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,660
I forgot I was playing through OBS.

1144
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,620
Oh, I guess I should've saved...

1145
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,940
I should've saved that.

1146
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,820
Look at them.

1147
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,260
Let them out!

1148
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
Let them out!

1149
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:04,480
Let them out!

1150
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,520
I should've saved that.

1151
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,320
Oh my gosh.

1152
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,780
I am on my last life.

1153
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:09,800
You know.

1154
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,100
Guys, what if I use save states, though?

1155
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:25,740
Whoa.

1156
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,960
Is that lab?

1157
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,200
Wait.

1158
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,020
What is this doing?

1159
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,300
Is that a hidden door?

1160
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,500
Oh, I thought it was gonna collapse on me.

1161
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,360
Okay.

1162
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,160
We'll shame you.

1163
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:55,480
What?

1164
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,900
You can't get hurt by the spikes!

1165
00:49:59,360 --> 00:49:59,980
Oh, no!

1166
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,460
Wait, what is this?

1167
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,500
Oh, wait, is it...

1168
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:08,070
Okay.

1169
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,310
Under the water?

1170
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,510
Oh, there we go.

1171
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,310
I was too...

1172
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,070
I'm too full of air.

1173
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:20,950
Wait, can...

1174
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,210
Does Kirby have a...

1175
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,330
You know...

1176
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,270
Water is safe.

1177
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,430
Oh, what up?

1178
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,590
Oh my gosh.

1179
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,470
Bless, bless.

1180
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:30,990
Yippee!

1181
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,350
Is this where I just was?

1182
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,950
Oh, yes, I was.

1183
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:53,250
Okay.

1184
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,340
I'm gonna become the Joker.

1185
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,840
I'm gonna become the Joker.

1186
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,330
Okay.

1187
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:08,990
Watch out of spikes.

1188
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,330
Watch out for spikes.

1189
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:11,350
Watch out...

1190
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,450
Watch out for...

1191
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,910
Oh, I forgot that this guy doesn't care...

1192
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:23,670
About...

1193
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:26,860
About...

1194
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,940
He's just...

1195
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,100
He's just living his own little spiky life.

1196
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,300
And I would like to get rid of at least...

1197
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,940
Most of this.

1198
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,420
There we go.

1199
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,280
There we go.

1200
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:40,740
Alright.

1201
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,270
What is that thing?

1202
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,390
I like to eat more than I like to...

1203
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:00,790
Just...

1204
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,250
Plain destroy, you know?

1205
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:03,950
Hermit crab.

1206
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,070
His ass did not want to move.

1207
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,830
He was taking his nap, and he was not accepting anything else.

1208
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:12,050
Wait.

1209
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,310
Is there anything up here?

1210
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,450
What is that?

1211
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:16,950
Uh...

1212
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:17,170
Wait.

1213
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,610
I've got one of those before.

1214
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:18,830
No?

1215
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,230
I don't remember...

1216
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,130
Oh, it made me super powerful, right?

1217
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,480
Oh, wait.

1218
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:31,860
Just kidding.

1219
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,560
It's a max heal.

1220
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,460
Okay, important.

1221
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,420
Full heal.

1222
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,800
My butt just wants to, like, press up to jump, you know?

1223
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,740
Like, and...

1224
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,100
Do nothing else.

1225
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:51,440
Hey.

1226
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,040
Hey, chill.

1227
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,340
Chill.

1228
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:52,520
Chill.

1229
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,160
Oh my god.

1230
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,770
What's happening?

1231
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,050
Oh, I got a thing.

1232
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:03,910
I don't know...

1233
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:04,530
Oh, the curry!

1234
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:05,970
I forgot about the curry.

1235
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,230
Makes me really powerful!

1236
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,350
Where did you come from?

1237
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:14,790
The curry!

1238
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,150
It's a good...

1239
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,140
Lucky day!

1240
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,500
Lucky day!

1241
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:25,620
Lucky day!

1242
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,740
The curry, uh...

1243
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,480
I was confusing the ca... the curry and the... and the tomato.

1244
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,880
I thought I was about to face a boss or something.

1245
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:43,700
I was scared.

1246
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:55,590
I'll take that.

1247
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,470
Is this boss time?

1248
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,970
Oh, we're going far.

1249
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,050
Oh no, I'm stuck!

1250
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,090
Just kidding.

1251
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,870
Everything is happening so fast.

1252
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,490
Kirby, are you okay?

1253
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,020
Are you okay, buddy?

1254
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,500
Why are there even crabs up here?

1255
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,040
Crabs in... in the clouds.

1256
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
A yam!

1257
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,220
Oh, shoot!

1258
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:41,960
Oh, shoot!

1259
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:42,920
Ah, shoot!

1260
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:43,960
Don't touch me!

1261
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:54,150
First time?

1262
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:54,910
First try?

1263
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:54,990
Why?

1264
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,790
How many stages are there?

1265
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,850
Bubbly clouds...

1266
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,610
What

1267
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:27,310
is that?

1268
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,350
I think everything in this game is stupid.

1269
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,870
Like, positive, not like, you know.

1270
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,990
Like, wow, this is a dumb game.

1271
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,050
No, like, positive, stupid, cute, you know.

1272
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,390
I like the music here.

1273
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,210
I hate... these guys...

1274
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,720
Oh, come on!

1275
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,540
Kill that thing!

1276
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,780
Oh, you don't want to shoot your own now, huh?

1277
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,400
Yeah, I dare you to shoot.

1278
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,820
Shoot to kill.

1279
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,280
Oh my god.

1280
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,180
Holy...

1281
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,340
I'm just...

1282
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,160
I'm just...

1283
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,560
I'm just fat enough.

1284
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,700
Oh, so cute!

1285
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,120
Wow, they really explode.

1286
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,020
Can I suck them?

1287
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:23,960
No.

1288
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,060
I should... keep my distance.

1289
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,980
Do not inhale.

1290
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,680
Oh, okay.

1291
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:32,560
Oh, devil!

1292
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,020
Did I get sick?

1293
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,020
No?

1294
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,440
They sure are cute.

1295
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,220
Are you guys having, like, uh...

1296
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,800
What's it called?

1297
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,040
Uh...

1298
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:49,920
Flashbacks, right?

1299
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,820
Harry Poopins!

1300
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,460
No, no, I'm not gonna let you...

1301
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,300
Have the...

1302
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,800
The chance to even start shooting at me.

1303
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,720
What?!

1304
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,840
Ouch,

1305
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:17,760
ouch, ouch, ouch!

1306
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,820
Okay.

1307
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,660
Got his ass?

1308
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,080
Whoa!

1309
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,680
Sir Kibbles?

1310
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,400
Is that his name?

1311
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,480
Sir Kibbles?

1312
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,700
What a cute name.

1313
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,600
Okay.

1314
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,540
That's enough of you.

1315
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,460
Okay.

1316
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,900
This part seems scary.

1317
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:46,600
Alright.

1318
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:47,780
Careful.

1319
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:48,400
Careful.

1320
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:49,820
Careful.

1321
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,060
Sir Kibbles.

1322
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:52,940
Yeah.

1323
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,160
Waddle

1324
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,200
do!

1325
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:02,660
Yes!

1326
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,180
Yes!

1327
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,820
Waddle do!

1328
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,440
I recognize the eye guy.

1329
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,200
Why are you not swallowing them to get their powers?

1330
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:09,700
What?

1331
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,660
Oh, this is a...

1332
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,640
This is a walkway.

1333
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,000
Okay.

1334
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,520
Oh, no, no, no.

1335
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,420
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1336
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,900
Oh, you guys said don't...

1337
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:24,580
Okay.

1338
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,360
I understand.

1339
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,540
I understand now.

1340
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,220
They are not cute.

1341
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,140
I understand.

1342
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,880
Oh, wait.

1343
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1344
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,240
Come here.

1345
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,000
You come here.

1346
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:40,180
Yeah.

1347
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,220
Hey, chill.

1348
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,320
Oh.

1349
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:54,880
Oh, dang it.

1350
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:56,780
Uh...

1351
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,040
Oops.

1352
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,730
These damn kids not knowing Kirby didn't...

1353
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,030
Always have coffee.

1354
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,250
Get off my lawn.

1355
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:16,650
Oh.

1356
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,650
What are you talking about?

1357
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,830
He always had it.

1358
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,970
That's what everybody told me.

1359
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:25,470
You

1360
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,400
guys told me that just now.

1361
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,340
Kirby has always gets the...

1362
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,000
Has coffee.

1363
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,420
Always has...

1364
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,820
Had the ability to get the abilities.

1365
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:39,980
Oh, shoot.

1366
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:40,460
Okay.

1367
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:40,980
Wait.

1368
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,440
I can't figure out your pattern.

1369
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm stupid.

1370
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:44,540
Please.

1371
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,800
Ah, okay.

1372
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,180
I figured it out.

1373
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,580
Your gamer subs cup and desk mat finally came in and holy neurons activated.

1374
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,980
Actually, they've been asking me about my flavor.

1375
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,820
So, flavor.

1376
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,480
Eventually.

1377
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,860
They were asking me about what artist I want to work with.

1378
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:07,960
Oh.

1379
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:08,680
Wow.

1380
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,020
He really dodged that.

1381
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,160
Good job.

1382
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:16,680
Oops.

1383
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,840
I did not think that was gonna happen.

1384
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,600
I made a mistake.

1385
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,160
What is this?

1386
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,840
Okay.

1387
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,120
I don't know if I'm going the...

1388
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,980
I'm not going the right way.

1389
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,960
What does Minto taste like?

1390
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,140
What is one of...

1391
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,340
Life's great mystery...

1392
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,940
I was distracted, sorry.

1393
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:08,130
He goes down.

1394
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:10,330
He goes down again.

1395
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:11,670
And then we go up and...

1396
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,300
Wait.

1397
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,260
Will he jump again?

1398
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,100
Stupid.

1399
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:33,840
Um...

1400
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,040
Close.

1401
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,380
Okay, nevermind.

1402
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:39,210
Okay.

1403
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,070
What was it?

1404
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:41,610
It was over...

1405
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,110
Yeah, this guy right here.

1406
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:44,930
Okay.

1407
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:46,870
He does that.

1408
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:48,950
Okay.

1409
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:53,190
I was in the one spot that he touches.

1410
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:02,570
The yams and curry make you inflate and shoot puffs of air because both foods made the creator sakurai burp a lot.

1411
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:06,310
I can't burp though.

1412
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,350
Does curry make you burp?

1413
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,070
Okay.

1414
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,170
We made it.

1415
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,580
No?

1416
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,850
Spicy food.

1417
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:30,310
Oh.

1418
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:32,870
I guess that makes sense.

1419
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,870
Oh, shh.

1420
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:38,570
Holy.

1421
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:39,890
Holy mini boss.

1422
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:41,590
Oh my god.

1423
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:43,750
I'm not gonna live.

1424
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,490
I'm not gonna live.

1425
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,570
To see the day.

1426
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,230
Let me out of here, please.

1427
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:50,350
Please.

1428
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,790
He was so bright eyed and sparkly.

1429
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,830
I was mistaken.

1430
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:13,680
Okay.

1431
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:14,660
Okay.

1432
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:16,900
Oh shoot.

1433
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,320
I think I have to kill him.

1434
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,100
Wait.

1435
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,200
My game is lagging.

1436
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:22,840
What is happening?

1437
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,320
Did you guys see that?

1438
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:24,840
Wait.

1439
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,300
My game was lagging for real?

1440
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,720
What was happening?

1441
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,840
Why is my game lagging?

1442
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:31,460
Wait.

1443
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,660
Wait, actually.

1444
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,880
Why is my game lagging?

1445
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:41,660
Alana.

1446
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,960
I paused it.

1447
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,740
I don't think it's OBS.

1448
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,220
It's probably...

1449
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:49,480
What?

1450
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,720
You guys say Game Boy limitations, but this is on the Switch.

1451
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,400
They emulated the real limitations?

1452
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,260
No way.

1453
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,220
Seriously?

1454
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,620
Why would you do that?

1455
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,630
Why?

1456
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:06,990
Okay.

1457
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:07,930
Okay.

1458
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:08,850
Okay.

1459
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:10,690
Help me out.

1460
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:11,490
Help me out.

1461
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,050
Oh my god.

1462
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,310
How is this playable?

1463
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:15,710
Legitimate question.

1464
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,250
How is this playable?

1465
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,100
Is this the beginning...

1466
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,940
Of the level?

1467
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,880
I think so.

1468
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,620
Skill issue.

1469
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:53,480
Yeah.

1470
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,280
Yeah, okay.

1471
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,860
Oh, he did it!

1472
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,240
Chat is lagging a bit tonight.

1473
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,100
Sent at 719.

1474
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,240
What?

1475
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,940
You're confusing me.

1476
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,090
You're confusing me!

1477
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:18,510
Stop!

1478
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,430
Stop confusing me!

1479
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:22,690
Oh!

1480
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,410
I sucked myself into oblivion.

1481
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,900
Chat's lagging.

1482
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,360
I think that's a skill or show.

1483
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,320
Wait, so if I suck too many...

1484
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,280
Too many little guys, I fall?

1485
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,560
I get too fat?

1486
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,540
Why do I keep falling?

1487
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,040
Oh, maybe I'm...

1488
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,720
Maybe because...

1489
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,220
Oh, I have a guy in my mouth.

1490
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,100
Okay.

1491
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,680
I did...

1492
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,960
I did the same thing twice.

1493
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,020
Maybe we should just restart this one.

1494
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,960
Get your ha...

1495
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,460
Minds out of the gutter, everybody.

1496
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,340
We're talking Kirby.

1497
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,320
We're not talking anything else.

1498
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:21,090
Oh, it's this guy.

1499
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:24,990
Dude...

1500
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:26,510
Oh!

1501
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,500
Not you, not you!

1502
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,100
No.

1503
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:41,500
Onwards.

1504
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,450
Oh, I almost had that guy.

1505
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:54,670
Oh, that was close.

1506
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:03,630
Oh.

1507
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,630
I can't remember how...

1508
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:13,330
Oh, I guess...

1509
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,170
I did get...

1510
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:20,500
I guess I did get kind of far beforehand.

1511
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,400
Before...

1512
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,140
The boss.

1513
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,040
Dang.

1514
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,340
The boss is so tricky though, because he's so...

1515
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,100
He's got...

1516
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,820
The lag is so hard.

1517
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,240
Oh, ouchy.

1518
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,580
I didn't realize it was that close.

1519
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,630
Just gonna leave you alone.

1520
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,250
Oh!

1521
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:51,750
Woo!

1522
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,290
What the hell...

1523
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,410
I'm losing lives left and right here.

1524
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,730
Oh no, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.

1525
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,370
Come here, you.

1526
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,150
Come here, you.

1527
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:12,910
I didn't go as...

1528
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,610
According to plan.

1529
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,220
Oh, it's this room again.

1530
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:40,600
Okay.

1531
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,500
I remember...

1532
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,420
We died in here before.

1533
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:42,780
We...

1534
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,420
We got this.

1535
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,360
We understand this room.

1536
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:49,580
And...

1537
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:50,940
Up in there.

1538
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,360
There we go.

1539
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:55,980
I like...

1540
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:56,560
This guy.

1541
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,700
Come here.

1542
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,000
Oh, please, stop it.

1543
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:22,220
Okay.

1544
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:23,740
Oh,

1545
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:40,270
shoot.

1546
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,370
That was just...

1547
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,610
Just a little...

1548
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:43,990
Um...

1549
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,570
Well, good thing he doesn't know how to turn around.

1550
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:46,110
Stupid.

1551
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:47,590
I'm back!

1552
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:48,150
Wait.

1553
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,090
I take a sippy.

1554
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:52,710
This isn't even a boss.

1555
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,170
This is like a mid boss, no?

1556
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,670
I'm guessing.

1557
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:58,910
Like, this isn't the boss boss?

1558
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,220
Okay.

1559
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,180
Still tough.

1560
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:05,760
Alright.

1561
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,780
What the heck is this guy?

1562
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,220
So, I'm guessing I have to get him.

1563
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,700
Why is Kirby running?

1564
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,200
Kirby.

1565
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,260
Reposed, buddy.

1566
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:16,780
Woah!

1567
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:20,800
Hold on.

1568
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:21,440
Woah!

1569
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:29,720
Hold on.

1570
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:30,500
I'm taking a...

1571
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,620
A cough drop.

1572
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,810
Appreciation to Badaku!

1573
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:37,970
Pew!

1574
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:40,730
Look at him, girl.

1575
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,030
He's got them sick moves.

1576
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:45,570
Okay.

1577
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:48,250
I'm guessing I have to suck up the other guy and hit him with that.

1578
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:49,990
Cause my...

1579
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:51,450
My other moves did not do anything.

1580
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,150
So...

1581
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,690
I'm gonna try and not fly.

1582
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:56,770
Oh, ouch.

1583
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:58,970
Ouch!

1584
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:00,190
Oh!

1585
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:02,930
Oh, I missed.

1586
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:03,950
Ouch!

1587
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:04,330
Catch him!

1588
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,010
He's just...

1589
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:08,530
Come here.

1590
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,720
You guys, it's going so poorly!

1591
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,720
There's nowhere safe!

1592
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:40,660
Please!

1593
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:41,900
And...

1594
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:42,800
Jump...

1595
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,100
Shoot!

1596
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:43,700
Oh!

1597
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,220
I'm holding my Mega Man.

1598
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,200
Come here!

1599
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,340
Come here!

1600
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,520
I got him once!

1601
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:52,560
Yes!

1602
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:58,610
Ah!

1603
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,290
Articles on the screen!

1604
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,070
Oh, I got his ass!

1605
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,070
Oh, ouch.

1606
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:17,070
He got my ass, too.

1607
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,390
Mutual ass beating.

1608
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,030
Come here, come here.

1609
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:21,890
Just one more!

1610
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:23,470
Yeah!

1611
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:35,880
Uh-oh.

1612
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:36,840
Wait, what's the yam?

1613
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,120
Why do we need the yam?

1614
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,100
Oh, gosh.

1615
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,140
I'm in space?

1616
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:52,310
I think I missed my opportunity.

1617
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:56,690
Sorry, I thought it was going to be a fight like before.

1618
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,490
Pew, pew!

1619
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,100
Let's just make ourselves a nice little pathway.

1620
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:13,260
Oh, I can get some water!

1621
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,900
Oh my gosh, please!

1622
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,760
I'm so thirsty!

1623
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,100
Wait, what else is in here?

1624
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,900
More water!

1625
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:27,130
There we go.

1626
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,790
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1627
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,730
Yeah, I'm playing Minecraft right now.

1628
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,360
Does Kirby fit in one by one?

1629
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:39,560
Run!

1630
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:40,460
Nice.

1631
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:40,780
Okay.

1632
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,700
I guess he does.

1633
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,100
He's a teeny tiny little guy.

1634
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,960
I'm so thirsty!

1635
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:54,790
Imagine getting that only just to waste it.

1636
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,340
I was...

1637
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,920
Okay, but I want that other water too.

1638
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:21,870
This one is the...

1639
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,130
Maybe I should come from the other side.

1640
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,750
Oops.

1641
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,660
I'm gonna go in from the other side.

1642
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,500
Wait, I don't need...

1643
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,300
Oh, is it just a...

1644
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,300
Oh, it's the full heal.

1645
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,020
Okay, never mind.

1646
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:37,360
Just kidding.

1647
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:38,900
We don't need it.

1648
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,720
I could get the full heal now if I wanted to.

1649
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,360
You know what?

1650
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:00,520
Yeah.

1651
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,160
I'm gonna get it.

1652
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:18,310
Okay.

1653
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:20,410
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

1654
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:27,870
Am I just safe in here?

1655
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:28,350
Yeah.

1656
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:31,170
We're playing it real safe.

1657
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:32,690
I don't trust myself.

1658
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:33,250
That's why.

1659
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,370
I don't trust myself.

1660
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:38,230
Okay, here we go.

1661
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:38,710
Whee!

1662
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:40,650
Oh, all these guys are back.

1663
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:41,110
That's right.

1664
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,890
Oh, shoot.

1665
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,200
I knew that was gonna happen.

1666
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,140
That's the sad part.

1667
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,340
I knew it was gonna happen.

1668
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,380
I knew it was gonna happen.

1669
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:56,920
So, I...

1670
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,160
That's why I was like, oh, these guys are back.

1671
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,420
Oh, that's right.

1672
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,340
It's this thing.

1673
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,040
Wait, do these...

1674
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:26,960
I'm guessing these hurt me.

1675
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:39,860
Please!

1676
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:40,980
Okay.

1677
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,160
Oh, maybe they don't.

1678
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:47,520
Okay.

1679
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:48,300
Just kidding.

1680
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,360
Like, it's one of those types of games, you know?

1681
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,080
Where you're just...

1682
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,640
Maybe I'm so used to...

1683
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,380
Oh, what's that game?

1684
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:57,400
Not...

1685
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:58,960
Nas don't know Atlantis.

1686
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,640
I'm so used to that.

1687
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,660
Where it's like, any...

1688
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,520
Any teeny tiny thing touches you and you're just...

1689
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:09,880
What

1690
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:15,120
it is!

1691
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,720
Everything's so sparkly!

1692
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:20,080
Yep!

1693
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:25,390
I'll...

1694
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,930
Wait, did I kill him?

1695
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,570
Or did he touch me?

1696
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,010
Actually, I'm not sure.

1697
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:30,850
Whoa!

1698
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:32,790
Golly!

1699
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:36,010
Let Minto get to the Kirby lore.

1700
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,470
Is there lore in this game?

1701
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:38,770
I feel like there wouldn't be, you know?

1702
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,970
I'm just gonna keep going up.

1703
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,920
I rescued that yesterday.

1704
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:02,700
You're welcome.

1705
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,260
Oh, no.

1706
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,380
No, no, no, no.

1707
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,040
Wait, wait, wait.

1708
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,020
What a frame.

1709
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,600
Guys, if I die here, I die in real life.

1710
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,740
Is this the boss boss?

1711
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,940
It's gonna be so over.

1712
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,100
Look at him go.

1713
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,640
You missed the secret room.

1714
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:37,220
Oh, gosh.

1715
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,260
The streamer missed a room on a game that she's never played before.

1716
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:44,920
Gosh, I hate when streamers miss the secret room on a game they've never played before.

1717
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:47,500
Just...

1718
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,860
Yeah, I know I'm already dead.

1719
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,000
And that's the problem!

1720
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,060
That's the problem!

1721
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,480
We'll see how toughy this is if I want to save state.

1722
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:07,780
Okay.

1723
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,940
Why are you puffy?

1724
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,040
Oh.

1725
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,160
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1726
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,680
Suddenly it's Toho.

1727
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,640
Oh, shoot!

1728
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:25,920
Oh.

1729
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,500
You also shoot things.

1730
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:27,800
Okay.

1731
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:32,840
Yes!

1732
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,360
I got him!

1733
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,420
I got his ass.

1734
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,240
Oh, just kidding.

1735
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,120
I'm eating your bullets.

1736
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:40,620
Give me your guy.

1737
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,560
Oh, shoot!

1738
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,260
Dang him!

1739
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,340
Oh!

1740
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,440
Oh!

1741
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:50,700
Oh!

1742
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:51,580
Oh!

1743
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,600
The lag, oh the lag is...

1744
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,380
killer.

1745
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,140
Please release another man.

1746
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:08,720
Easy.

1747
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:12,140
I would did it, wait why was that actually so easy?

1748
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:13,800
Oh,

1749
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:17,560
lagi.

1750
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,200
He didn't do the...

1751
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,920
If he had just swooped one more time I would of been so dead.

1752
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,000
Oh my god.

1753
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,100
Maladity!

1754
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,240
If he had swooped one more time, I would have been donezo.

1755
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,180
Why is he...

1756
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,260
When his face is like this, it's so funny.

1757
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,360
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

1758
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,220
I wanna go back.

1759
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,840
Wait, no, no, send me back!

1760
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,120
Send me home!

1761
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:53,770
Wait, uh...

1762
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:55,800
Is it a boss rush?

1763
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:01,360
Oh, I just killed that guy.

1764
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,540
Wait, wait?

1765
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,760
Where's the boss?

1766
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,480
What?

1767
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,420
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1768
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:54,900
Oh, shoot!

1769
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,100
Oh, I forgot to jump, my bad.

1770
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,460
Oh, shoot!

1771
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:02,520
Ah!

1772
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,860
I'm gonna die to this guy, I'm gonna die.

1773
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,560
Please, send me a man.

1774
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:12,920
I

1775
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:20,730
need...

1776
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:21,830
I need a hero!

1777
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,070
Oh, shoot, I thought it was it.

1778
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,130
I need a hero!

1779
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,930
I need a hero!

1780
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:29,070
Okay.

1781
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:30,650
That's one bash down.

1782
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,080
Oh, these guys!

1783
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,220
I have one health.

1784
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:48,860
D...

1785
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:49,680
D...

1786
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,980
Yeah, it's so over.

1787
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,700
One HP for four bosses.

1788
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,600
And I'm guessing I have to fight him, too, no?

1789
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:02,520
Um,

1790
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,500
I thought this was, uh...

1791
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:08,960
Nintendo.

1792
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,880
What in the Capcom is this?

1793
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,640
The boss rush?

1794
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:19,910
One HP in a dreamland!

1795
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,820
I forgot about this area.

1796
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,880
Cows and everything.

1797
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:34,880
Look at you guys.

1798
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,640
The birds!

1799
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:45,850
Yeah, I wish they would give me HP.

1800
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,010
That would be really...

1801
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:47,570
Oh.

1802
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,510
That would be something, huh?

1803
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:50,810
Oh, this guy.

1804
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:52,250
Jolly lad.

1805
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:53,550
Over here.

1806
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,510
Oh, I have to destroy them, I guess.

1807
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:56,510
Oh my gosh.

1808
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:26,730
So...

1809
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:29,210
Kirby needs better grip on his shoes?

1810
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:35,490
Kirby needs a bit better grip on his shoes.

1811
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,170
I'm just gonna say.

1812
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:37,310
I'm just gonna tell him now.

1813
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,870
Good thing we only fought this one guy, right?

1814
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,450
What should we do?

1815
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:52,270
Maybe we do the harder ones first.

1816
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:54,830
Okay, so let's go with this one first.

1817
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:09,430
I heard that grunt from across the room.

1818
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:13,510
Yeah, we're blaming his shoes.

1819
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:15,410
Yeah, why wouldn't we?

1820
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,280
Why is this...

1821
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,100
This area is my final boss.

1822
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,900
Make it to land.

1823
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,480
Just make it to land.

1824
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:51,320
Don't...

1825
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,980
Okay.

1826
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:00,660
Okay.

1827
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,900
What was this boss, anyway?

1828
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:13,630
Kirby shoes?

1829
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:17,870
The tree.

1830
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,570
Yeah, I'll remember it.

1831
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:20,590
I'll remember it.

1832
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:21,870
Like, I remember...

1833
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:22,730
I don't remember what he did.

1834
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:26,210
Oh, no!

1835
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:27,550
He can actually hit me now!

1836
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:28,170
Oh, that's right.

1837
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:33,880
That's right.

1838
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:34,720
I remember now.

1839
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:35,640
Oh, shoot!

1840
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:36,120
Ouch!

1841
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,900
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1842
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,320
Oh, come on!

1843
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:47,370
Okay.

1844
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:49,310
Get me out of here.

1845
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:57,190
Okay.

1846
01:26:57,190 --> 01:26:57,290
Okay.

1847
01:26:58,710 --> 01:26:59,290
Um...

1848
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:01,750
Let's see.

1849
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:03,630
Oh, this one was the shmup one.

1850
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:05,950
Let's just go in.

1851
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:06,990
Let's just do this one.

1852
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:14,810
I won't have you.

1853
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,890
I won't have you.

1854
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,320
I'm guessing...

1855
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,200
Down into the pits?

1856
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:35,480
Okay.

1857
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,540
I love the way this guy itches at you.

1858
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,080
What?

1859
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,160
This is so...

1860
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:44,600
No!

1861
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,860
Oh, no, you guys.

1862
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:48,500
I'm gonna touch the spikes!

1863
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,840
I'm gonna touch the spike!

1864
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,420
This is so evil!

1865
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:54,600
Oh!

1866
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,060
Wait, this is actually so mean.

1867
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:58,680
What is...

1868
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,040
Why am I playing Flappy Bird all the time...

1869
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:01,560
All the sudden?

1870
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,160
Flappy Curb?

1871
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,610
Oh my gosh!

1872
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:11,810
Merflazer!

1873
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,990
Have you been around?

1874
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,910
I feel like I haven't seen anyone forever!

1875
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:21,030
What the hell?

1876
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,710
Okay.

1877
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:29,610
Just pace it out.

1878
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:32,770
Oh gosh.

1879
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:34,430
Spinabit, yeah!

1880
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:37,070
Wow!

1881
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:39,270
Thanks for coming back!

1882
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:44,150
Okay.

1883
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:44,990
I did it.

1884
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,210
Oh.

1885
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,110
He's flexing on me.

1886
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:51,910
Okay.

1887
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:53,010
Okay.

1888
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:53,710
Alright, we made it!

1889
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:54,090
Oh!

1890
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:55,690
Thank Bunker.

1891
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:56,590
So good to publish.

1892
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:57,230
I like you.

1893
01:28:58,110 --> 01:28:58,410
Okay.

1894
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:04,560
Ah!

1895
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,480
There we go.

1896
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:12,760
There we go.

1897
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:13,120
Okay.

1898
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,620
I guess I could've...

1899
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:15,660
Gone down, you know?

1900
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,000
Whatever.

1901
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:17,820
The Yam!

1902
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:20,800
Here we go!

1903
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,280
Oh, shoot!

1904
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,160
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

1905
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,220
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

1906
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:37,860
I don't...

1907
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,160
I don't...

1908
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:40,760
I don't know his pattern.

1909
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:41,320
I just...

1910
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,840
I just literally stayed on him the entire time there.

1911
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:51,810
Hold on, guys.

1912
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:53,070
I gotta take a...

1913
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,480
I have one last syrup.

1914
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,920
Give me a second to eat it.

1915
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,740
My throat's not hurting.

1916
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,120
It's just really, like...

1917
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:04,980
Phlegmy today.

1918
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:05,760
I don't know why.

1919
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:23,950
No, I don't think I'm getting sick.

1920
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:25,050
Hmm.

1921
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,770
Yeah, probably too much ectoplasm.

1922
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,440
I think I'm gonna get more...

1923
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,140
Drink in a second.

1924
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:34,220
Yeah.

1925
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:43,370
The tiniest music loop ever.

1926
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:47,510
I guess they don't expect you to stay on this menu for...

1927
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:48,510
For this page...

1928
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:48,850
Page?

1929
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:49,450
This...

1930
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:49,850
This...

1931
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:50,190
Screen!

1932
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:50,770
There we go.

1933
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:55,390
Glad to see this game still looking great and bringing you joy.

1934
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,010
Thank you!

1935
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,390
I'm having fun.

1936
01:30:58,170 --> 01:30:58,530
Sorry.

1937
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:16,650
Oh, I missed him.

1938
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,020
Oh, that's right.

1939
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:34,300
Here.

1940
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,380
I've already lost...

1941
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,040
Three health.

1942
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,400
The pain!

1943
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,120
The...

1944
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,800
I wish the yam would give me health.

1945
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,540
That thing took three damage.

1946
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,260
That's insane.

1947
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:11,170
Alright, when he...

1948
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:14,370
I just gotta remember he's gonna rev up and then go...

1949
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:16,370
Okay.

1950
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:33,360
Oh, oh.

1951
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,660
I need to pay attention.

1952
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,000
I'm not at all, actually.

1953
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:37,180
Oh, ouchy, ouchy.

1954
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:37,360
Oh!

1955
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:38,780
Oh my god.

1956
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,280
There we go.

1957
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:40,220
Okay.

1958
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:41,560
Oh!

1959
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:56,250
That yam is called the mint leaf?

1960
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:57,250
Wait, no kidding?

1961
01:32:57,770 --> 01:32:58,190
Wait.

1962
01:32:58,590 --> 01:32:58,890
Is...

1963
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:01,950
Wait, is there a type of yam called the mint leaf?

1964
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:07,860
The run lives on!

1965
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:08,160
Oh my god.

1966
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:13,850
I don't know.

1967
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:14,690
What should we do next?

1968
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,490
I'm gonna die for sure at the next one.

1969
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:16,950
Oh, well.

1970
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:17,230
Okay.

1971
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:19,150
What if I do...

1972
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:21,310
The lovers...

1973
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:24,550
And then we do the eyeball.

1974
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:26,650
Oh, but I need...

1975
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,190
Oh gosh.

1976
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:28,410
Wait, sorry.

1977
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:29,110
I'm gonna pause it.

1978
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:30,670
I only have two lives left.

1979
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:31,910
I have to save one for...

1980
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:32,570
I have to save one for...

1981
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:33,450
For ddd2.

1982
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:39,430
JP is yam.

1983
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:40,310
En is mint.

1984
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:44,270
Is it cause I speak English?

1985
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:45,830
Okay, hold on.

1986
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:47,170
I'm gonna go get some more tea real quick.

1987
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,930
I'll be right back.

1988
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,230
Sorry.

1989
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:51,750
I didn't expect my voice to get...

1990
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:53,790
Wanna save state it?

1991
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:54,330
I might.

1992
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:55,490
I might.

1993
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,230
We'll see how I'm feeling.

1994
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:59,790
Because I don't mind doing all of them again.

1995
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:01,350
They don't take that long, you know.

1996
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:03,450
Okay, I'll be right back.

1997
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:56,750
Sorry, I left you in the...

1998
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,050
In the silence with your own thoughts.

1999
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:00,830
I left you in the silence.

2000
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:06,510
She's back.

2001
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:08,530
Welcome back, thank you.

2002
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:09,690
Thank you, thank you.

2003
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:12,490
It was lonely.

2004
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:14,570
Was it...

2005
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:16,650
Was it lonely without me?

2006
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:18,570
Let's just go for it.

2007
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:20,610
Alright.

2008
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,470
Oh, I forgot I have to...

2009
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:26,250
I hate that I have to go through the stage first.

2010
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:27,850
Wait, so I'm guessing I go up.

2011
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:30,150
Oh, no, please.

2012
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:31,690
That is a witch.

2013
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:32,870
That's no maid.

2014
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:39,290
That is a witch.

2015
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:43,210
I'm scared of the mask.

2016
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:43,970
I don't like it.

2017
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:46,070
It's like a creepy no mask.

2018
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:48,490
It's muddy stuff.

2019
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:49,050
Exactly.

2020
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:54,960
What are you supposed to do with the masks?

2021
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,500
Where are they going?

2022
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,920
She's going crazy.

2023
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,080
Just avoid it.

2024
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:40,470
I think I can go over it.

2025
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:45,570
You cannot go over it.

2026
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,830
Wait, I don't even see this sleepy thing right here.

2027
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:48,730
What the hell is this?

2028
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:50,110
Woo!

2029
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:58,330
Are you winning, men?

2030
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:00,250
I'm not losing.

2031
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,850
Just a little bit, actually.

2032
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:03,690
Oh, it's me!

2033
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,810
I found me!

2034
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:08,350
Okay.

2035
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:09,830
Hey!

2036
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,580
I like spicy men.

2037
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,560
Bubba is an herb and not a spice.

2038
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:17,460
Explain.

2039
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,380
Oh my gosh, wait.

2040
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:21,360
Okay.

2041
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,920
Did you see that juke?

2042
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:32,660
That was a gamer move if I've ever seen one.

2043
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,660
I need to learn how to jump instead of...

2044
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:36,020
Okay.

2045
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,180
Okay.

2046
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:38,340
Get it.

2047
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:43,080
Nice.

2048
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:52,700
Damn, I missed him.

2049
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:55,980
I missed him.

2050
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,120
Ah.

2051
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:12,910
Oh!

2052
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:14,110
Oh my god, I did get him.

2053
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:14,450
Nice.

2054
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:17,190
I was afraid that my input...

2055
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:18,170
My button...

2056
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:19,810
Sorry.

2057
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:23,940
I didn't mean to have such a dramatic gasp.

2058
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,740
Stop coming over...

2059
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,880
Wait, I guess I could've...

2060
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:38,610
Nice!

2061
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:40,790
Okay, one...

2062
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,290
One guy down.

2063
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:43,890
Okay.

2064
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:47,930
I like to just focus on...

2065
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:49,350
Like, a couple of them, you know?

2066
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:51,890
Nice.

2067
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:53,890
Got your ass.

2068
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:03,060
I like to get it from behind.

2069
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:04,700
Yeah.

2070
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:11,710
It stresses me out!

2071
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:13,210
Stop running at me!

2072
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:13,930
Okay.

2073
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:15,130
Okay.

2074
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:15,270
Yeah.

2075
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,340
Nice.

2076
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:22,380
Oh, wait.

2077
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,200
Okay, we'll just wait for them to come back up here.

2078
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,360
And then...

2079
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:26,580
Oh, wait.

2080
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,900
Oh, but they'll be...

2081
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:29,380
Oh.

2082
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:31,700
Wait.

2083
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:33,400
Wait.

2084
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:39,690
Come back to the top, please!

2085
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:42,710
Yeah, it'll hit the block if I do it, so...

2086
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:43,710
What did I phrase?

2087
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:44,710
What did I say?

2088
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:47,850
Oh, here we go, here we go.

2089
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:51,410
Nice!

2090
01:39:58,330 --> 01:39:58,770
Okay!

2091
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,200
Oh, it's the eyeball though.

2092
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,200
You guys, it's the eyeball!

2093
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:13,200
Maybe I should've done this one first.

2094
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2095
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:36,450
Where did I go from here?

2096
01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:38,670
Oh, I guess...

2097
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:40,170
Oh, please leave me alone.

2098
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:41,170
Freak.

2099
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:43,710
Leave me alone.

2100
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:47,820
Leave me alone.

2101
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:48,160
Everybody.

2102
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:50,720
Okay.

2103
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,840
Don't touch me.

2104
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,220
Don't talk to me.

2105
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,380
I'm anti-social.

2106
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,160
I...

2107
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,680
Don't want to be...

2108
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,560
Involved in any...

2109
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,080
Affairs.

2110
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,400
I don't wanna talk.

2111
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,160
I don't wanna...

2112
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,340
Look in your direction.

2113
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:18,960
Okay, nice.

2114
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,480
That was painless.

2115
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:21,920
Barely.

2116
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:29,510
Never speak to me or my Kirby again.

2117
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:31,690
Alright.

2118
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:39,990
Those Gordos are insta-kill, by the way.

2119
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:40,910
What's a Gordo?

2120
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:45,530
I don't know the name of the enemies.

2121
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:52,030
The spiky balls.

2122
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:52,610
Oh.

2123
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:54,390
The spiky balls.

2124
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:59,370
I did hit that guy before.

2125
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:00,450
Yeah, and I did die.

2126
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:07,240
Okay.

2127
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,600
Oh, gosh.

2128
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:10,940
Oh, I'm nervous.

2129
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,220
Let's just go.

2130
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,600
It's not looking hot, guys.

2131
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,200
It's not looking so hot.

2132
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,560
It's not looking so hot.

2133
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:43,060
Oh.

2134
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:43,740
Ouch.

2135
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:44,920
How do I avoid you?

2136
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:45,880
When you do that?

2137
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,720
Oh, I'm losing lives like crazy.

2138
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,040
Oh, my gosh.

2139
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:02,210
Crouch in the corner.

2140
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:06,670
If I can get to the corner.

2141
01:43:07,330 --> 01:43:07,710
Okay.

2142
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,370
I like my, my little plan here.

2143
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:30,630
You just stick to the right.

2144
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:34,230
Stick to the right, baby.

2145
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:38,810
And then you just drop right on his head and everybody dies.

2146
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:38,910
Oh, guys.

2147
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:41,250
Easy peasy.

2148
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,540
My insti...

2149
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:52,720
I know I shouldn't jump over him, but my instinct wants me to.

2150
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,360
You know what I mean?

2151
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:58,940
Me getting in the corner.

2152
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,420
I'm preemptive.

2153
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,440
Oh.

2154
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:03,660
Oh.

2155
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,500
That hurts.

2156
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:21,590
Just kidding.

2157
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:26,920
Sorry.

2158
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,200
I'm angry.

2159
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:36,400
Sorry.

2160
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:38,820
Angry.

2161
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:39,620
Sorry.

2162
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:44,680
Please.

2163
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:45,840
Please come in.

2164
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,220
I wouldn't say clean.

2165
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:10,040
But...

2166
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:11,620
An attempt was made.

2167
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:13,860
Okay, how do I kill this...

2168
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:14,680
Oh, my God.

2169
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,340
Oh, my God.

2170
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:16,720
Ouch.

2171
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:17,120
Wait.

2172
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:52,670
I'm deciding.

2173
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:55,590
I'm deciding if I wanna...

2174
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:56,850
If I wanna...

2175
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,210
Go back in time or not.

2176
01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:05,210
Oh, I did...

2177
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:06,270
Oh, I didn't create one.

2178
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:14,280
Wait, it saved?

2179
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:15,820
Oh, my gosh.

2180
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:16,460
You're right.

2181
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:18,360
Oh, the game was so kind.

2182
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,040
Oh, my gosh.

2183
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,160
The game is kind.

2184
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,360
Okay.

2185
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:27,280
Okay.

2186
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,280
I saw someone say I swallow the stars or...

2187
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,120
Oh.

2188
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:33,600
Ouch.

2189
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:34,080
Ouch.

2190
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:34,600
Ouch.

2191
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:34,940
Wait.

2192
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,420
Are there stars?

2193
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,180
Oh.

2194
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:38,940
Ouch.

2195
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,140
Wait.

2196
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:41,680
Oh.

2197
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:45,560
He just did the same thing after doing everybody else.

2198
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:45,960
Ow.

2199
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:46,420
Stop.

2200
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:48,780
Holy cow.

2201
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:51,420
How are you supposed to swallow the stars?

2202
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:51,940
How are you supposed to swallow the stars?

2203
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:52,680
This guy is...

2204
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,280
Insano style.

2205
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:55,720
Leave me alone.

2206
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:56,720
Wait.

2207
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:58,900
Wait.

2208
01:46:59,580 --> 01:46:59,920
Wait.

2209
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,400
Okay.

2210
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,140
Oh, my God.

2211
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:12,020
He is really good at cornering you, though.

2212
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:13,880
Oh, shoot.

2213
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:14,300
Ouch.

2214
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:16,140
Okay.

2215
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:23,830
I

2216
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:29,690
was too preemptive.

2217
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:31,710
I don't know why I thought he would stop.

2218
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:32,930
Ow.

2219
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:33,690
Oops.

2220
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:35,190
Okay.

2221
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:39,050
Okay.

2222
01:47:39,490 --> 01:47:40,070
Okay.

2223
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,710
Okay.

2224
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:41,430
I understand now.

2225
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:41,950
I understand.

2226
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:44,430
Oh, my God.

2227
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:44,830
Please.

2228
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:45,590
Get me out of here.

2229
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:46,150
Dude.

2230
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:53,800
Come here.

2231
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:58,940
I like when he does that, you know.

2232
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:00,580
It's nice and easy.

2233
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:04,820
Yeah, stupid.

2234
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:05,800
Ha-ha.

2235
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:05,980
Oh.

2236
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:08,160
Dang, I could've...

2237
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:09,600
Okay.

2238
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,440
Oh, dang it.

2239
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,300
How am I supposed to be in front of him during that?

2240
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:30,160
Yeah, the pixel art is so good, right?

2241
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:31,740
Oh, shoot.

2242
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:32,520
Ah, shoot.

2243
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:38,830
Can you jump?

2244
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:40,250
Stop.

2245
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:42,070
This guy is so clumsy.

2246
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:44,890
He's so clumsy.

2247
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:46,730
Oh, shoot.

2248
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:47,530
Oh, ow!

2249
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:00,030
Oh, ah!

2250
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:00,850
I almost had it.

2251
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:01,670
Oh, shoot.

2252
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:02,530
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2253
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:08,660
I can't...

2254
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:09,900
I can't time it very well.

2255
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:11,040
Oh, ew!

2256
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,200
Okay, here we go.

2257
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:15,940
Oh, yeah.

2258
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,560
There we go.

2259
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:17,080
Nice.

2260
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:18,540
I...

2261
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:18,940
I...

2262
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:19,440
I barely...

2263
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,580
dented him, though.

2264
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,480
I barely dented him.

2265
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:27,560
Beep.

2266
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:32,390
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, yeah.

2267
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:33,090
Keep down that.

2268
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:35,230
Keep doing that, keep doing that.

2269
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:38,930
Keep doin' that.

2270
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:41,390
Yeah, yeah, keep doin' that.

2271
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:46,390
No way, that's... crazy.

2272
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:50,170
I got tapped by his... by his mallet.

2273
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,600
Oh, the backswing, yeah.

2274
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:04,830
Oh, it was too far away!

2275
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:06,530
Oh, that sucks.

2276
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:08,010
That would've been so good.

2277
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:09,690
Please.

2278
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:16,590
Nice.

2279
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:31,380
I don't know how to time it, so I just avoid it.

2280
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:33,080
I'm sorry.

2281
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:35,360
I don't know how to time it.

2282
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,440
I don't know how to time it!

2283
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:47,630
Slow and steady.

2284
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:48,970
Slow and steady!

2285
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,220
Oh, shoot.

2286
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:56,300
No, I didn't go up high enough.

2287
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:09,160
I was so close!

2288
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:15,520
Let me try... Maybe I can try and figure out the mallet situation.

2289
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:17,460
Oh, my gosh.

2290
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:17,800
Wait.

2291
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:18,760
Oh, my god.

2292
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:19,020
Wait.

2293
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:19,360
Oh!

2294
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:20,020
Oh, I'm dying.

2295
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,200
I lost two health.

2296
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,400
This is so unfair.

2297
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:30,140
Cause I, like, jump to... to avoid it, but...

2298
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:32,340
Maybe if I, like, just jump instead of...

2299
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:32,480
Okay, run.

2300
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:35,040
Aha!

2301
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:36,260
Hi!

2302
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:37,460
Okay.

2303
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:47,170
Oh, that was not good.

2304
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:47,810
That was it.

2305
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:49,270
That was the op... I got cornered.

2306
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:49,510
Oh!

2307
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:51,150
Wait, this is not the run!

2308
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:52,570
Wait, this is so not the run.

2309
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:56,850
This is so not the run.

2310
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:57,630
Ouch!

2311
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:57,910
Ouch!

2312
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:58,250
Ouch!

2313
01:51:58,410 --> 01:51:58,410
Ouch!

2314
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:58,850
Ouch!

2315
01:51:59,010 --> 01:51:59,010
Ouch!

2316
01:51:59,070 --> 01:51:59,070
Ouch!

2317
01:51:59,210 --> 01:51:59,210
Ouch!

2318
01:51:59,310 --> 01:51:59,390
Ouch!

2319
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:02,190
Ow!

2320
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:02,190
Ow!

2321
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:02,190
Ow!

2322
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:02,850
I'm a combo!

2323
01:52:05,130 --> 01:52:05,930
Oh, my gosh!

2324
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:16,330
Oh, my gosh!

2325
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:16,390
Oh, my god.

2326
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:16,550
Wait.

2327
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:17,070
Uh, sorry.

2328
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:17,810
I heard something.

2329
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:18,930
I thought it was my cat.

2330
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:20,070
Sorry.

2331
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:20,610
Sorry.

2332
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:23,630
Can you, like...

2333
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:25,570
Oh, shoot!

2334
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:26,150
There we go.

2335
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:26,470
Okay.

2336
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:27,410
Oh, dang it.

2337
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:28,650
That was the perfect opportunity, no?

2338
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:30,690
Oh, I'm gonna die here.

2339
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:31,230
Ouch.

2340
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:33,010
Not die.

2341
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:33,770
I mean...

2342
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:34,010
You know.

2343
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,220
I didn't want to be cornered there.

2344
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:55,480
Ouch!

2345
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:55,880
I...

2346
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:21,600
Oh, it was too far.

2347
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:23,600
Oh, my gosh.

2348
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:24,240
That was so close.

2349
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,060
I almost touched him.

2350
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,400
I almost touched him for real.

2351
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:28,460
Wait.

2352
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,200
Okay.

2353
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:31,760
King Dedede!

2354
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,560
Chill out, please!

2355
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:35,880
Okay.

2356
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:37,460
Nice to...

2357
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:40,100
He just tripped over nothing.

2358
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,620
I'm so stupid.

2359
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,980
He tripped over...

2360
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,140
Dummy.

2361
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,500
Oh, that was me.

2362
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:00,460
Nice to...

2363
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:01,340
My soup.

2364
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:08,420
I keep going up too high.

2365
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:09,120
I don't mean to.

2366
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,040
Is this it?

2367
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:16,110
That's something you would do.

2368
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:17,030
Shut up.

2369
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:41,170
He says, I'm stealing your house and all your food!

2370
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,020
Now try hard mode.

2371
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:49,740
I think I'm good.

2372
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:02,840
Kirby is hungry.

2373
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:05,760
He's going down.

2374
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:12,490
That was so silly.

2375
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:16,390
Bobby!

2376
01:55:17,070 --> 01:55:17,810
Thanks, Bobby.

2377
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:20,270
Special thanks, Cypher.

2378
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:22,190
Cypher...

2379
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:26,230
Good job, Green Shizu Girl!

2380
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:30,310
Who's Bubby?

2381
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:32,410
Ah, and so many players!

2382
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:36,070
Kirby's Dream Land, presented by...

2383
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:37,950
Howl?

2384
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:39,450
I'm bored, sorry.

2385
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:40,590
And Nintendo.

2386
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:42,330
Thank you for playing.

2387
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:43,450
Yeah!

2388
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:48,990
Oh, oh, after- after credits scene.

2389
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:56,080
It's... oh!

2390
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:58,860
Oh, give me the turnip!

2391
01:55:59,040 --> 01:55:59,860
Oh, bye-bye!

2392
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:02,120
So cute!

2393
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:04,380
So cute!

2394
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:06,080
Give me the banana, please!

2395
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:09,260
Press A.

2396
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,960
I thought that was... oh, King Doody.

2397
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:16,260
Press up A and select on the title screen to start a new adventure.

2398
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,520
G... guck?

2399
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:22,460
Guck, everybody!

2400
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:25,380
Ah, it's a little temper tantrum.

2401
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:31,820
I love how it shows the... the... the Game Boy.

2402
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:33,460
Thank you, Eduardo!

2403
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:38,280
Haven't played this one, so kinda how it... so... kinda how it... wait.

2404
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:39,960
Well done, and thanks for the playthrough!

2405
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:45,120
It was fun to watch Kirby mercil- mercilessly slaughter the kingdom, murder the king, and steal his house.

2406
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:47,400
Haven't played this one, so it kinda seems without a context.

2407
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:48,220
Right!

2408
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:51,400
Oh, it said good luck!

2409
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:52,940
I thought it said guck!

2410
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:55,680
Is that it?

2411
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,280
How do I get to the title screen?

2412
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,000
Hey, you're pretty good!

2413
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,260
I beat another... gaming classic.

2414
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,580
Another... another one in my belt.

2415
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:13,500
No save states needed.

2416
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:17,780
Reset?

2417
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:18,580
How do you reset?

2418
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:22,840
Logan, thank you so much for the five gifted!

2419
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,000
Thank you!

2420
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:24,620
Thank you!

2421
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:25,100
Thank you, thank you!

2422
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,360
Z-L-Z-R.

2423
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,480
Oh!

2424
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:31,900
Oh, like... okay, okay.

2425
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:37,570
What was it?

2426
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:39,310
Select...

2427
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:41,130
Up...

2428
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:43,570
What was it?

2429
01:57:43,690 --> 01:57:44,330
I'm just curious.

2430
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:47,990
Up, A, select.

2431
01:57:48,570 --> 01:57:49,630
Up, A, select.

2432
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:53,230
Extra game!

2433
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:55,270
I'm just curious.

2434
01:57:55,850 --> 01:57:57,310
I love green greens.

2435
01:57:57,650 --> 01:57:58,730
What a... what a name.

2436
01:58:01,150 --> 01:58:01,750
Oh!

2437
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:07,760
Wow, they're fast!

2438
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:09,820
Holy moly, they're fast!

2439
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:11,480
I just ate a chicken.

2440
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:13,860
Wait, wait.

2441
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:15,500
Why is it, like, lagging even more?

2442
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:17,920
You guys notice that?

2443
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:22,000
Another W for retro VTuber means...

2444
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:24,580
Oh my gosh, even the cake is evil!

2445
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:26,880
Extra game playthrough win.

2446
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,760
I don't...

2447
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,620
Wait, I didn't go in here last time.

2448
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:32,880
Are you kidding me?

2449
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:35,360
There was health in here the whole time and I just missed it?

2450
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:43,640
Oh my god, chicken.

2451
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:45,160
Oh my god.

2452
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:48,500
Jolly.

2453
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,280
Ow!

2454
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:56,080
Oh, he dive-bombed me!

2455
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,320
I love riding the star.

2456
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:02,460
That might be my favorite part.

2457
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:07,350
Oh my god.

2458
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:16,240
Holy- Holy...

2459
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,640
He dive-bombed me!

2460
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:23,600
Oh my gosh.

2461
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:23,980
Ouch.

2462
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:25,380
Oh my god.

2463
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:25,880
Oh my god.

2464
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:26,940
Oh my god.

2465
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:29,840
I killed him.

2466
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:30,740
No I didn't kill him.

2467
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:31,400
Oh my god.

2468
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,500
He's going to kill me.

2469
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:33,960
They're eating her.

2470
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:35,800
And then they're going to eat me.

2471
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,320
Oh my god.

2472
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,180
This is when you will learn, kid.

2473
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:52,900
If you... Oh, I just... Wait, it wasn't a cake at all.

2474
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:53,960
It's a little worm.

2475
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,780
I thought worms are supposed to be in apples, you freak.

2476
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,400
Don't worry, guys.

2477
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:01,860
I'm not going to play the whole game again.

2478
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:05,960
I'm just... I'm just curious how things are in hard mode, you know?

2479
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:07,220
Oh my gosh.

2480
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:16,100
Man.

2481
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:16,820
Oh my god.

2482
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:17,260
Oh my god.

2483
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:18,760
Oh, I just barely missed that.

2484
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:21,120
Yeah.

2485
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:22,000
Leave me alone.

2486
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:24,720
Jolly.

2487
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:28,680
Oh my gosh.

2488
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,640
It's lagging so badly.

2489
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:35,200
Like, how are you supposed to...

2490
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:36,120
You know?

2491
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,160
Oh my gosh.

2492
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:41,700
How are you supposed to play when it lags so bad?

2493
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:47,440
I just noticed my health.

2494
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:49,840
How did I get that bad?

2495
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,670
Congratulations on beating...

2496
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:59,050
Minty's Dream Land.

2497
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:00,410
It's an awesome game with...

2498
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:01,950
Other goofy characters like...

2499
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:04,270
...Gordos, and Blombos, and Fantos, and whatnot.

2500
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:07,830
I'm excited to see what other classic game you'll be next.

2501
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:08,510
Thank you!

2502
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:12,230
A chicken.

2503
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:14,030
Oh, I kept getting hit by the chicken.

2504
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:19,210
That guy was supposed to be my dinner.

2505
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:21,470
What is he doing up there anyway?

2506
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:23,390
Oh, he's doing a little circle dance.

2507
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:26,190
Oh, shoot.

2508
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:34,710
Yeah, die chicken.

2509
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:43,340
Oh, my gosh.

2510
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:45,740
How am I actually so good at this game?

2511
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:49,140
Said no one ever.

2512
02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:55,480
Okay, let's see if I can beat the first boss.

2513
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:01,700
Oh, my God.

2514
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,500
What the hell?

2515
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:03,220
Oh, my God.

2516
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:03,540
Ouch!

2517
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:04,080
Ouch!

2518
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:04,720
Ah!

2519
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:05,200
Ah!

2520
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,440
Congrats on complaining.

2521
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:30,600
You're curvy ramparts.

2522
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:33,280
I mean, though, you know about Gimmick.

2523
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:34,400
Mr. Gimmick in the West.

2524
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:35,420
It's like...

2525
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:36,320
It's cute like Kirby.

2526
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,160
I think it would be fun to see him play one day.

2527
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:39,340
Things are always bright in your days.

2528
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:40,300
Thank you, Wobbling.

2529
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:41,440
I didn't know about it.

2530
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,060
But I'll look into it.

2531
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:45,880
This is diabolical.

2532
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:48,820
This is so evil.

2533
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:51,900
Okay, we'll just go until I run out of lives, right?

2534
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:52,880
Let's just keep...

2535
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:53,320
Let's just...

2536
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,040
We'll keep trying until I run out of lives.

2537
02:02:58,320 --> 02:02:59,500
That's so evil.

2538
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:01,340
Actually...

2539
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:01,620
Actually...

2540
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:02,780
And the...

2541
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:04,020
And the apples hurt too.

2542
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,440
Everything hurts.

2543
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:06,740
Everything hurts.

2544
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:09,080
Oh, my God.

2545
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,320
Oh, my God.

2546
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:11,640
Oh, my God.

2547
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:11,780
Oh, my God.

2548
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,460
What are you...

2549
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:15,700
What are you supposed to do?

2550
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,120
Attention

2551
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:30,420
at all.

2552
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:31,840
Because I'm laughing so hard.

2553
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:32,820
Oh, here we go.

2554
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:33,400
Here we go.

2555
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:33,940
Here we go.

2556
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:40,480
No way, I didn't get him because of the... OK... Oh... I got him, I got him, I got his ass.

2557
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:41,260
I got his ass.

2558
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:43,800
Wait, is this the run?

2559
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:45,260
Wait, please.

2560
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,100
Wait, no, no, no, it's not the run.

2561
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:48,140
I lied, I lied.

2562
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:50,020
I lied, I lied, I lied.

2563
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:51,280
I lied.

2564
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,320
I

2565
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:57,000
hit it.

2566
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:57,900
I got, I got hidden.

2567
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,520
Oh, wait, I have one more life?

2568
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:01,280
OK, let's go.

2569
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,060
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

2570
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,560
Okay.

2571
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,600
Oh my gosh.

2572
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:13,660
No, that was supposed to hit you.

2573
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:18,400
No, you were the chosen one.

2574
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:19,220
Okay, nice.

2575
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:19,840
Ouch, ouch.

2576
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:20,680
Never mind, not nice.

2577
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:23,360
You were the chosen one.

2578
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:27,760
Okay, once you kind of... Ouch, I need to turn around.

2579
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,240
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2580
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:40,880
I got close, though.

2581
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:41,800
I got pretty close.

2582
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:43,320
He had two hits left.

2583
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:47,080
You did good, Min.

2584
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:47,780
Thank you.

2585
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,420
That was insanity.

2586
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:53,160
Got a good handle of the pattern.

2587
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:55,900
If he hadn't blown down at that last one, you know.

2588
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,660
I think I would have had it.

2589
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:00,660
But this was so fun.

2590
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:04,880
I hope you guys look forward to more Kirby games in the future with me.

2591
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,960
And, you know, I just... I do like playing retro games.

2592
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:09,240
They're... they're challenging.

2593
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:12,780
And I like that they help me...

2594
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:14,280
...grow.

2595
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:15,160
You know?

2596
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,200
Thank you, love.

2597
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:17,940
Thank you.

2598
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:19,940
Thank you, Tri-Pertsaurus.

2599
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:22,360
Yahoo.

2600
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:27,780
Yeah, I want to go through more of these.

2601
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:28,480
So, you know.

2602
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:31,760
I just wanted to start Kirby at the very beginning.

2603
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,420
Especially because I haven't played any of them before.

2604
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:34,320
So...

2605
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2606
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:36,420
Yay!

2607
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:38,000
I don't know when I'll play the next one.

2608
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:40,560
I'm not... It's probably not going to be like a weekly thing.

2609
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:42,520
It'll probably just be like whenever I feel like...

2610
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:43,300
Playing Kirby.

2611
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:44,220
I'll play Kirby.

2612
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:45,140
Kind of deal, Leo.

2613
02:05:46,660 --> 02:05:48,560
But we'll play more in the future.

2614
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:51,640
We shall, we shall.

2615
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,080
Enjoy seeing all the differences.

2616
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:55,100
Yeah, right.

2617
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:57,100
Wait, so...

2618
02:05:57,100 --> 02:05:59,000
Does Mega Man win?

2619
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:03,800
One day.

2620
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:09,980
Congrats on beating your first Kirby.

2621
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:11,560
Kirby Superstar is my favorite.

2622
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,020
It has great co-op.

2623
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,640
Hope you have fun with it when you get there.

2624
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:16,380
Thank you!

2625
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:17,640
Thank you for the fun stream.

2626
02:06:17,740 --> 02:06:18,300
Thank you!

2627
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:19,700
Thank you, thank you.

2628
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:23,200
May I recommend the OG Ghostbusters from the Super Nintendo?

2629
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:29,740
Ghostbusters.

2630
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:32,440
Thanks for today and happy late 5th anniversary.

2631
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:34,280
Thank you, Mario Playser.

2632
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:35,080
Thank you.

2633
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:36,600
Welcome back.

2634
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:40,220
Glad you had fun.

2635
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,480
Next game is the girl.

2636
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:42,260
Let's go.

2637
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:43,620
Thanks for the fun stream.

2638
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:44,260
Thank you.

2639
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:45,220
Thanks, Makini.

2640
02:06:45,940 --> 02:06:46,820
Thank you, Vita.

2641
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:47,820
Thank you.

2642
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,060
Thank you, Ankylosaurus.

2643
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,300
Ankylosaurus.

2644
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:59,240
I always said Ankylosaurus as a kid.

2645
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:01,080
So I have to stop myself from saying that.

2646
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:02,740
But that's actually my favorite dinosaur.

2647
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,980
Thanks for showing us how to beat the game like a pro.

2648
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:06,680
Thank you.

2649
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:08,840
I love retro gaming, VTubers.

2650
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,680
Welcome to the club.

2651
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,920
I dabble, I dabble.

2652
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:20,160
Kirby Superstar rules.

2653
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:20,980
Get power up.

2654
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:21,580
We stand it.

2655
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:23,580
Yeah, when does Kirby get the powers up?

2656
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:24,160
Powered up.

2657
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:25,340
Hello, I'm Puyo.

2658
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,860
Thanks for the stream.

2659
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:29,640
Extra phlegm is probably from your throat healing.

2660
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,000
Make sure to hydrate and do healthy things.

2661
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:35,940
Like not scream too much at any...

2662
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:38,500
Well, my throat doesn't hurt even though I scream, so...

2663
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:39,140
Oh, next game?

2664
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:39,640
So, soup?

2665
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:40,660
Oh, let's go.

2666
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:44,180
I will once again recommend you try Sly Cooper.

2667
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:46,020
I never played that, Salken.

2668
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:49,200
Wait, Salken!

2669
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:51,280
What does your girlfriend think about your tattoo?

2670
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:52,660
I'm just curious.

2671
02:07:56,540 --> 02:07:58,400
Is she watching me right now?

2672
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:07,560
Is she watching right now?

2673
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:08,980
I want to know too.

2674
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:15,040
Is she a wisp?

2675
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:16,260
Yeah, our girlfriend.

2676
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:16,860
Sorry, bye-bye.

2677
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:18,780
Our girlfriend.

2678
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:24,700
I'll fund heart, gold, soul, silver for a stream.

2679
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:28,840
Oh my gosh, I would love to do a Pokemon run where I...

2680
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,520
Where I...

2681
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:34,900
I like doing runs where I use only Gengar.

2682
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,700
I would love to do something like that.

2683
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:39,020
Pirate, thank you!

2684
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:42,040
Fukuro, thank you!

2685
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,200
Bodying, dooday.

2686
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,600
It's not a Nuzlocke.

2687
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:49,600
It's like, uh...

2688
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:50,200
One...

2689
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,680
One Pokemon only.

2690
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:53,180
But like, not just one.

2691
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:53,740
Like, only...

2692
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:55,160
Like, I'll have six Gengars.

2693
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:55,720
You know what I mean?

2694
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,360
She's sleeping, but she thinks the tattoo is cute.

2695
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:00,820
She watches Chibidoki, though.

2696
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:01,940
So no wisp yet.

2697
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:02,760
Get her in!

2698
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:05,860
Get her in!

2699
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:08,520
She thinks the tattoo is cute, you guys.

2700
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:09,120
There's hope!

2701
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:10,180
Oh my god!

2702
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:13,080
You can tattoo another girl's name on your body.

2703
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:14,800
And you can still date somebody.

2704
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:15,700
That's insane!

2705
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:17,800
I'm so happy for you.

2706
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:34,130
Kirby's Adventure on NES.

2707
02:09:34,430 --> 02:09:35,330
Where he gets the powers.

2708
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:38,490
In the second Game Boy game, Kirby's Dream Land 2.

2709
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:39,810
Has powers also.

2710
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:41,570
Take it so long!

2711
02:09:41,670 --> 02:09:42,610
Thank you for the fucking thing!

2712
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:45,190
Retro streams are rare.

2713
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:45,990
This is really fun.

2714
02:09:46,170 --> 02:09:46,390
Really?

2715
02:09:47,410 --> 02:09:48,790
Sorry, I'm not good at them.

2716
02:09:49,150 --> 02:09:51,550
You know, I feel like people expect, like, you know...

2717
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:52,930
Because it's a retro game.

2718
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:54,730
You would expect a person to either grow up...

2719
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:55,930
With the game or something like that.

2720
02:09:56,130 --> 02:09:57,270
I never played these.

2721
02:09:57,870 --> 02:09:58,870
So for me...

2722
02:09:58,870 --> 02:09:59,850
It's all...

2723
02:09:59,850 --> 02:10:00,790
It's all new territory.

2724
02:10:06,330 --> 02:10:06,970
Now...

2725
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:07,810
Watching...

2726
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:08,750
With my wife!

2727
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:10,450
Hi, wife!

2728
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:11,550
Hi!

2729
02:10:12,090 --> 02:10:12,390
Hi!

2730
02:10:13,230 --> 02:10:13,870
Hello!

2731
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:17,470
I love the Kirby's Dream.

2732
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:18,130
So I'd...

2733
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:19,990
I'd be so down for a Pokemon's Dream.

2734
02:10:20,190 --> 02:10:21,990
Okay, we will do Pokemon in the future then.

2735
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:23,270
I love...

2736
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:25,810
I can play Pokemon for a really long time, you guys.

2737
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:26,470
So...

2738
02:10:26,470 --> 02:10:28,290
If I play Pokemon...

2739
02:10:28,290 --> 02:10:29,870
Expect, like...

2740
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:33,330
Crazy long stream.

2741
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:39,550
Expect crazy long stream.

2742
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:41,710
I would...

2743
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:42,730
I would...

2744
02:10:42,730 --> 02:10:43,390
I would...

2745
02:10:43,390 --> 02:10:44,590
I would pretend that I was going to the bathroom...

2746
02:10:44,590 --> 02:10:46,030
And I would sit on the toilet...

2747
02:10:46,030 --> 02:10:46,950
For, like...

2748
02:10:47,670 --> 02:10:48,190
Hours...

2749
02:10:48,190 --> 02:10:49,570
When I was a wee wisp.

2750
02:10:50,070 --> 02:10:50,590
And...

2751
02:10:50,590 --> 02:10:51,550
My mom would be like...

2752
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:52,130
Are you...

2753
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:53,590
Are you okay in there?

2754
02:10:53,770 --> 02:10:54,530
I'd be like...

2755
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:56,730
My stomach hurts so bad!

2756
02:10:57,870 --> 02:10:58,870
Playing Pokemon.

2757
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,300
So, yeah.

2758
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:08,700
When Sanic...

2759
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:10,740
Oh, you guys missed when I first played...

2760
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:12,960
I played Sanic before I went to heaven.

2761
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:15,020
My VOD is...

2762
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:15,260
Gone.

2763
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:19,080
The 15 hours of Minto Pokemon playthrough...

2764
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:19,880
Is what we need in life.

2765
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:20,980
Yeah, right?

2766
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,320
It's just so...

2767
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:23,660
I don't know.

2768
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:25,240
It's just so easy to play.

2769
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:27,440
It's so relaxing for me.

2770
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,100
I don't know.

2771
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:33,040
Hold on.

2772
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:33,860
Which one did I play?

2773
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:34,920
I think it was...

2774
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,320
I think I played Sonic 1 and 2.

2775
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:41,640
Any OG Wisps, remember?

2776
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:44,980
Any OG Wisps...

2777
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:46,940
Come out of the woodworks and remember?

2778
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,260
Let me see.

2779
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:51,640
Live.

2780
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:54,720
Oh my gosh.

2781
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:56,820
I have 400.

2782
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:57,520
It's like...

2783
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:00,180
You are on 60 out of 442.

2784
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:07,600
I mean, I could always play them again.

2785
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:08,660
I'm not saying that I won't.

2786
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:10,320
I'm just teasing you.

2787
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,100
Sonic 3 in the future.

2788
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:16,340
Maybe...

2789
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:16,900
Maybe...

2790
02:12:16,900 --> 02:12:18,780
There's so many games you gotta play.

2791
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:19,300
Okay.

2792
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:19,680
Oh!

2793
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:20,100
Sonic!

2794
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:21,060
I see Sonic 2.

2795
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,400
So I definitely did Sonic 1.

2796
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,360
Where is it though?

2797
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:26,900
Sonic 2.

2798
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:28,500
I played...

2799
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:30,820
March 15th, 2021.

2800
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:34,360
Wow!

2801
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:36,580
So long ago.

2802
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:39,920
Pokemon in the toilet is something all gamers do.

2803
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:40,640
It's true.

2804
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:41,540
It's true.

2805
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:44,140
Oh my gosh.

2806
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:47,200
I wasn't thinking about getting that Z Flip phone.

2807
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:48,720
The new Samsung.

2808
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:50,710
Because I just thought it was like...

2809
02:12:51,790 --> 02:12:53,530
Big and kind of unnecessary.

2810
02:12:54,930 --> 02:12:55,630
Like, you know?

2811
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:56,870
It's just kind of...

2812
02:12:57,810 --> 02:12:58,910
It's just kind of big.

2813
02:12:59,470 --> 02:13:00,990
And then it has a screen on the front too.

2814
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:01,950
I thought it was too much.

2815
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:04,850
And then I saw someone put a...

2816
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:05,890
Like a...

2817
02:13:05,890 --> 02:13:07,890
A DS emulator on it.

2818
02:13:07,970 --> 02:13:08,770
And I was like...

2819
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:08,850
Oh!

2820
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:09,590
Wait.

2821
02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:10,510
That's kind of cool.

2822
02:13:11,130 --> 02:13:11,590
Wait.

2823
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:12,670
Wait!

2824
02:13:14,250 --> 02:13:14,790
Wait.

2825
02:13:14,950 --> 02:13:15,910
It kind of looks awesome.

2826
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:21,860
It's pretty big unfolded.

2827
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:22,680
Yeah, right?

2828
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:23,620
It's huge.

2829
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:26,800
I don't need like a tablet in my pocket.

2830
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:29,160
But then I saw the 3D...

2831
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:29,600
Or the...

2832
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,300
The DS.

2833
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:31,740
And I was like...

2834
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:33,200
Wait.

2835
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:34,420
It's kind of cool.

2836
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:36,940
Am I like the Sonic Adventure games?

2837
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:37,760
Live and learn!

2838
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:40,620
Actually, I'm only seeing Sonic 2.

2839
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:42,000
Did I not play Sonic 1?

2840
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:44,520
Am I a poser?

2841
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:46,780
Yeah.

2842
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:51,620
It could be because...

2843
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:52,160
Well...

2844
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:53,520
When I was a wee wisp...

2845
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:54,840
I only had Sonic 2.

2846
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:57,540
So that could be why I played it.

2847
02:13:57,620 --> 02:13:58,660
For my own nostalgia.

2848
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:09,180
I want to play the one where that...

2849
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:10,720
Girl dies and everyone cheers.

2850
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:18,070
Yeah, I don't see the other Sonic.

2851
02:14:18,250 --> 02:14:19,410
I think I only did Sonic 2.

2852
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:19,910
Wait.

2853
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:22,250
Yeah, maybe I only did Sonic 2.

2854
02:14:24,710 --> 02:14:25,970
That's Adventure 2.

2855
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:27,650
What's wrong with you?

2856
02:14:27,850 --> 02:14:29,370
I want to know why they cheer.

2857
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:32,850
I want to know why.

2858
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:38,580
I'm just curious.

2859
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:41,980
Play Sonic 06.

2860
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:42,520
Oh my gosh.

2861
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:42,760
Wait.

2862
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:43,860
I actually want to.

2863
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:46,360
I want to experience Peek.

2864
02:14:47,380 --> 02:14:48,940
My spooky Oshii.

2865
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:52,640
I think everyone found her annoying.

2866
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:53,220
No.

2867
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:54,700
That's so sad.

2868
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:57,500
Is it one of those situations where like...

2869
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:58,140
I don't know.

2870
02:14:58,220 --> 02:15:00,500
There's some characters that people found annoying in the past.

2871
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:01,060
And then they...

2872
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:05,620
And then nowadays people actually appreciate them.

2873
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:08,200
Playing through retro games?

2874
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:09,680
Would you be interested in playing Star Fox?

2875
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:10,680
Oh, yeah.

2876
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:13,280
I've never played that either.

2877
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:14,600
I didn't have a...

2878
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,420
I only had a Game Boy.

2879
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:17,320
Well, no.

2880
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:17,520
Okay.

2881
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:17,780
Hold on.

2882
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:20,560
At Game Boy, I got...

2883
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:21,740
I got...

2884
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:27,420
I received Sega Nomad from my older sister.

2885
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,280
So that was a hand-me-down.

2886
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:31,420
And then I had a PlayStation.

2887
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:34,040
But I didn't have a...

2888
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:35,360
N64.

2889
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:38,840
So I never got to play any of...

2890
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:40,340
Like, that's why I never got to play Smash.

2891
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:42,020
Anything like that.

2892
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:43,460
Like, I never...

2893
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:44,980
I never had any of those.

2894
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:46,880
I didn't have a GameCube.

2895
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,920
For some reason, Game Boy was the only, like...

2896
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:53,080
Nintendo console I had.

2897
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:57,980
Until the...

2898
02:15:57,980 --> 02:15:58,940
Until the...

2899
02:15:58,940 --> 02:15:59,160
DS.

2900
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:00,400
Well...

2901
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:00,760
Yeah.

2902
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:01,620
Until the DS.

2903
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:03,900
So...

2904
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:05,520
Yeah, I didn't really play much of Nintendo.

2905
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:06,980
What about Legend of Zelda?

2906
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:08,880
I only played the Game Boy ones.

2907
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:11,260
I never played the N64 ones.

2908
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:12,500
Even to...

2909
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:12,960
Even now.

2910
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:14,720
Even to this day, I have not played.

2911
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:17,380
Like, Majora's Mask and Ocarina of Time.

2912
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:19,560
Never, never.

2913
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:22,540
You are a gaming hipster.

2914
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:23,780
Truly.

2915
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:27,640
I don't know if it would be trouble.

2916
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:30,040
Because Nintendo, but my favorite N64 games...

2917
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,560
Was Paper Mario and Zelda Ocarina Majora Mask.

2918
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:33,600
I want to play them.

2919
02:16:33,740 --> 02:16:34,160
I just...

2920
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:36,180
I guess I just never got around to it.

2921
02:16:36,260 --> 02:16:38,380
There was a time when I just didn't play a lot of games.

2922
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:39,420
You know?

2923
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,460
Like, I played...

2924
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:41,320
What I played...

2925
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:42,640
What I liked to play as a kid.

2926
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:43,720
And then...

2927
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:46,240
I stopped playing games for a long time.

2928
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:48,540
It was really la...

2929
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:48,820
Yeah.

2930
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:49,620
And then...

2931
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:50,760
Now I play games...

2932
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:51,440
Every day.

2933
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:53,620
You should totally play Zelda.

2934
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:54,880
Would it be crazy?

2935
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:58,060
To have somebody's first time ever playing...

2936
02:16:58,060 --> 02:16:58,880
In 2025?

2937
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:02,100
Is that a rare experience?

2938
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:05,860
Don't...

2939
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:08,280
I would play the hell out of...

2940
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:10,900
Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.

2941
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:21,540
Oh yeah, that's true.

2942
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:22,360
I guess they're...

2943
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:23,400
Well...

2944
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:25,940
Someone who grew up in that era...

2945
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:26,800
And didn't play them.

2946
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:27,620
I guess you're right.

2947
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:29,520
There are people that haven't played them...

2948
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:30,400
But they're babies!

2949
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:32,640
Those are the children...

2950
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:33,820
You're talking about.

2951
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:37,440
I'm thinking of someone...

2952
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,960
Of my...

2953
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:39,560
Status.

2954
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:44,040
My status.

2955
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:44,140
My status.

2956
02:17:51,230 --> 02:17:51,790
19.

2957
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:54,450
How long have you been 19?

2958
02:17:55,410 --> 02:17:56,330
Oh wait, sorry.

2959
02:17:56,490 --> 02:17:56,690
I'm...

2960
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:57,170
Wait, no.

2961
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,510
That's the...

2962
02:17:58,510 --> 02:17:59,630
No, I'm supposed...

2963
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:00,690
That's supposed to be Bella.

2964
02:18:01,230 --> 02:18:01,990
I'm 19.

2965
02:18:02,630 --> 02:18:04,210
How long have you been 19?

2966
02:18:05,170 --> 02:18:05,730
Forever.

2967
02:18:11,410 --> 02:18:12,950
No, not 20!

2968
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:18,070
I should have never shown you guys that video.

2969
02:18:20,210 --> 02:18:21,250
I actually...

2970
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:23,850
I don't regret showing you guys by audition...

2971
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:26,270
But I felt like it sparked a bunch of weird...

2972
02:18:26,270 --> 02:18:29,390
Weird dialogue from people being like...

2973
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:34,190
Imagine if Minta got into a holo instead...

2974
02:18:34,190 --> 02:18:37,450
But like then people were coming at me being like...

2975
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:38,410
How...

2976
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:39,390
But...

2977
02:18:39,390 --> 02:18:40,890
She would have to replace...

2978
02:18:40,890 --> 02:18:43,330
I don't want to replace anybody that's in myth, okay?

2979
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:46,750
I didn't show you guys with that as my intention...

2980
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:48,430
I just wanted to show you guys something that...

2981
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:50,110
I felt was like kind of...

2982
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:51,710
Lost to media, you know?

2983
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:52,450
You don't...

2984
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:53,190
And...

2985
02:18:53,190 --> 02:18:56,490
You don't really get to hear people's audition tapes sometimes...

2986
02:18:56,490 --> 02:18:57,390
Because, you know...

2987
02:18:57,390 --> 02:18:58,790
It's a little like...

2988
02:18:58,790 --> 02:19:00,090
If you want to get...

2989
02:19:00,090 --> 02:19:02,210
Into the company, you shouldn't...

2990
02:19:02,210 --> 02:19:03,330
Show off...

2991
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:03,850
That kind of stuff.

2992
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:04,490
You know what I mean?

2993
02:19:05,930 --> 02:19:06,370
So...

2994
02:19:06,370 --> 02:19:06,930
I don't...

2995
02:19:06,930 --> 02:19:07,470
It...

2996
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:08,350
It...

2997
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:08,570
It...

2998
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:10,330
It sparked a lot of...

2999
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:11,250
Uh...

3000
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:12,590
A lot of...

3001
02:19:13,190 --> 02:19:13,630
Um...

3002
02:19:13,630 --> 02:19:14,870
Dialogue that I was like...

3003
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:15,030
No!

3004
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:16,550
This is not what I did...

3005
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:18,670
I don't...

3006
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:20,690
I love everybody who is in myth...

3007
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:21,790
And I wouldn't want to...

3008
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:22,950
Replace any of them...

3009
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:23,630
And I...

3010
02:19:23,630 --> 02:19:26,330
Understand entirely why I did not get in...

3011
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:27,930
And I'm okay with that...

3012
02:19:27,930 --> 02:19:28,710
Uh...

3013
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:30,350
A lot of weird hypotheticals...

3014
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:30,690
Yeah...

3015
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:32,190
It made me a little uncomfortable...

3016
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:33,170
Not gonna lie...

3017
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:36,270
Because...

3018
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:37,130
Yeah...

3019
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:37,550
I don't know...

3020
02:19:37,550 --> 02:19:37,910
Uh...

3021
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:38,290
Uh...

3022
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:38,510
Uh...

3023
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:38,610
Uh...

3024
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:41,430
Uh...

3025
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:42,770
Yeah...

3026
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:42,970
Yeah...

3027
02:19:42,970 --> 02:19:43,650
It's treated as...

3028
02:19:43,650 --> 02:19:45,090
Minto from an alternate timeline...

3029
02:19:45,090 --> 02:19:46,450
And extended Minto verse...

3030
02:19:46,450 --> 02:19:47,090
Yeah...

3031
02:19:48,190 --> 02:19:48,710
Uh...

3032
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:50,130
Yeah...

3033
02:19:50,130 --> 02:19:50,490
Yeah...

3034
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:56,310
Yeah...

3035
02:19:56,310 --> 02:20:00,130
I didn't play the Switch remake, but I did like Link's Awakening.

3036
02:20:00,430 --> 02:20:03,470
We're happy we're in the Minto world line.

3037
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:04,910
Yeah, I am.

3038
02:20:06,530 --> 02:20:07,990
I'm happy to be here.

3039
02:20:08,590 --> 02:20:09,470
As Minto.

3040
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:12,650
It is all good.

3041
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:13,930
It is all good.

3042
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:22,340
The path and all that brought you here now is also part of what made you you.

3043
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:23,720
Yeah, exactly.

3044
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:26,500
You sounded so pure in the video.

3045
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:28,500
Glad you let your inner freak take over.

3046
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:29,320
I don't know.

3047
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:32,560
I don't know why I did such like a...

3048
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:34,340
Like a...

3049
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:36,500
Hello, my name is Mint Panda.

3050
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:38,040
Like it was so breathy.

3051
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:39,860
It sounded like a Disney princess.

3052
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:46,260
I don't know how... I don't think I would be able to keep that up for so...

3053
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:49,020
But I also... You know, it also was like...

3054
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,460
My mic and everything too.

3055
02:20:56,190 --> 02:20:58,090
My name is Mint Panda.

3056
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:02,890
I am forever.

3057
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:12,790
I don't know.

3058
02:21:13,450 --> 02:21:15,750
I don't know why.

3059
02:21:16,110 --> 02:21:17,230
But you know...

3060
02:21:17,230 --> 02:21:20,010
Lots of people's voices change...

3061
02:21:20,010 --> 02:21:21,530
As they stream, I think.

3062
02:21:25,690 --> 02:21:27,550
I just woke up and you're playing Kirby's Dream Land.

3063
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:29,010
Very nice to me though.

3064
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:33,030
I don't make it obvious, but I'm a big Kirby fan.

3065
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:34,110
I couldn't tell.

3066
02:21:35,730 --> 02:21:36,690
Actually, I just...

3067
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:39,290
I just finished Kirby's Dream Land.

3068
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:40,650
But thank you for the third day.

3069
02:21:41,130 --> 02:21:43,030
Never mind Hollow, your vids and the wisps love you.

3070
02:21:44,770 --> 02:21:46,730
And I am happy...

3071
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:48,250
Where I am right now.

3072
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:50,990
I do not plan on going anywhere.

3073
02:21:51,850 --> 02:21:54,030
I can say that... I can make that very clear.

3074
02:21:59,010 --> 02:22:01,550
You're still a princess, but with freaky thoughts.

3075
02:22:01,990 --> 02:22:02,470
Hehehe.

3076
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:03,270
Guilty.

3077
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:10,030
Also, I must point out that the mic quality in that video was surprisingly good.

3078
02:22:10,470 --> 02:22:10,950
I...

3079
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:12,470
I thought so too!

3080
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:15,430
Listening to it, I was like, what mic did I use?

3081
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:18,730
I have no idea.

3082
02:22:20,650 --> 02:22:22,310
It was really good and all.

3083
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:25,070
Interesting.

3084
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:31,670
I think that they...

3085
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:32,450
I think...

3086
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:35,690
They think you wouldn't have had such a bad time in Hollow instead of...

3087
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:36,010
In Heaven.

3088
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:37,890
Maybe.

3089
02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:41,650
I don't...

3090
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:43,490
Um...

3091
02:22:43,490 --> 02:22:44,210
Uh...

3092
02:22:44,210 --> 02:22:45,010
I have to...

3093
02:22:45,010 --> 02:22:45,890
To put it...

3094
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:47,850
Not to go too deep into it or anything.

3095
02:22:48,230 --> 02:22:48,710
I...

3096
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:49,870
You know...

3097
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:51,730
Accept the choice I made.

3098
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:55,410
I don't regret it because I was able to learn a lot.

3099
02:22:55,950 --> 02:22:56,430
So...

3100
02:22:56,430 --> 02:22:57,970
And all I can do is move forward.

3101
02:22:58,590 --> 02:22:59,650
Keep on keeping on.

3102
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:01,650
Yeah, yeah.

3103
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:04,810
Have you played Ghost Babble?

3104
02:23:05,350 --> 02:23:06,390
On the Game Boy.

3105
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:09,550
I did not play it on the Game Boy, but I did stream it.

3106
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:13,010
I did stream...

3107
02:23:13,010 --> 02:23:13,830
Ghost Bubble.

3108
02:23:14,010 --> 02:23:14,270
Yeah, yeah.

3109
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:17,010
So you can find the VOD on my channel.

3110
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:21,530
If Minto was a Kirby character, she would be Waddle Dee.

3111
02:23:22,090 --> 02:23:23,110
Who's Waddle Dee?

3112
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:27,450
Oh, he's so cute.

3113
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:30,970
Why am I Waddle Dee?

3114
02:23:35,570 --> 02:23:38,950
I had a dream you banned me from your membership, then announce your marriage of members.

3115
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:41,170
Why me?

3116
02:23:41,170 --> 02:23:42,510
I felt horrible.

3117
02:23:42,690 --> 02:23:44,610
Take responsibility to...

3118
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,010
Shut up.

3119
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:48,270
Don't...

3120
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:49,010
Oh my gosh.

3121
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:50,010
Have you ever done that?

3122
02:23:50,150 --> 02:23:53,630
Where you like have a dream about somebody, but in the dream they piss you off?

3123
02:23:53,770 --> 02:23:55,970
And then you wake up and you're actually mad at that person?

3124
02:24:00,110 --> 02:24:00,550
So...

3125
02:24:00,550 --> 02:24:01,150
Why...

3126
02:24:01,150 --> 02:24:01,750
Why...

3127
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:02,370
Why...

3128
02:24:02,370 --> 02:24:02,850
Why...

3129
02:24:02,850 --> 02:24:05,450
Why are we so stupid as a society?

3130
02:24:06,290 --> 02:24:09,010
It's a shame Mint didn't pass the Three Stooges audition.

3131
02:24:09,350 --> 02:24:10,850
I think she'd be Curly Howard.

3132
02:24:11,430 --> 02:24:12,170
Uh, joke's on you.

3133
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:13,090
I'm their producer.

3134
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:18,110
I think that's a girl thing.

3135
02:24:19,030 --> 02:24:19,830
I don't know.

3136
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:20,810
I don't think so.

3137
02:24:21,590 --> 02:24:23,750
I think that's a thing people do.

3138
02:24:24,690 --> 02:24:25,790
Women thing!

3139
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:29,230
That's a female thing.

3140
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:31,310
Why is it getting worse and worse?

3141
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:33,250
Um, that's what girls do.

3142
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:34,590
Um, that's a...

3143
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:36,310
That's what women do.

3144
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:38,790
Um, that's a female thing.

3145
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:43,250
It's just getting more and more degrading.

3146
02:24:53,130 --> 02:24:54,330
Oh, dude's here.

3147
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:55,270
I'm...

3148
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:56,510
I'm one of the dudes.

3149
02:25:09,050 --> 02:25:09,710
Okay.

3150
02:25:11,890 --> 02:25:12,550
Okay.

3151
02:25:12,970 --> 02:25:13,270
Anyway.

3152
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:17,810
Um, thank you guys for carving again.

3153
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:21,010
Do an epic watch along.

3154
02:25:22,570 --> 02:25:24,430
Oh, like the epic musical.

3155
02:25:24,970 --> 02:25:25,450
Maybe.

3156
02:25:26,430 --> 02:25:27,110
Maybe, maybe.

3157
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:31,710
My brother beat the shit out of me in a dream.

3158
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:33,530
And when I woke up, I told him how sick it was.

3159
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:45,110
That's a good relationship.

3160
02:25:47,490 --> 02:25:49,130
Thank you for streaming with everybody!

3161
02:25:49,330 --> 02:25:50,030
I'm gonna head out.

3162
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:51,830
And, um...

3163
02:25:51,830 --> 02:25:52,850
Yeah, this is a lot of fun.

3164
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:56,510
This is so silly.

3165
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:00,510
Um, I'm gonna raid Kiwawa.

3166
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:02,630
She's playing Blueprints and I want to go watch.

3167
02:26:05,230 --> 02:26:06,390
So, otumito everybody!

3168
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:07,410
Thank you!

3169
02:26:07,530 --> 02:26:08,050
Have a good day.

3170
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:08,590
Have a good night.

3171
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:09,470
And I will see you...

3172
02:26:09,470 --> 02:26:10,810
When I see you...

3173
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:11,410
Next!

3174
02:26:12,370 --> 02:26:13,810
Enjoy the rest of your day, Mito.

3175
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:14,390
Thank you!

3176
02:26:14,470 --> 02:26:14,990
You as well.

3177
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:15,470
Enjoy...

3178
02:26:15,470 --> 02:26:17,590
I will see you guys on Sunday.

3179
02:26:18,130 --> 02:26:18,570
Um...

3180
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:19,590
It's my rest day.

3181
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:20,170
So...

3182
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:21,490
Enjoy the rest of your weekend.

3183
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:22,690
And I will see you guys...

3184
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:23,750
When I...

3185
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:24,350
See you...

3186
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:24,770
Next!

3187
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:26,250
Bye-bye!

3188
02:26:26,750 --> 02:26:27,190
Otumito!

3189
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:28,490
Thank you so much, everybody!

3190
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:29,750
Thanks for your help, too.

3191
02:26:29,930 --> 02:26:30,350
With, uh...

3192
02:26:30,350 --> 02:26:31,030
With some of these...

3193
02:26:31,030 --> 02:26:31,750
Some of these guys.

3194
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:32,990
Otumito!

3195
02:26:32,990 --> 02:26:34,110
Bye-bye!

3196
02:26:34,190 --> 02:26:34,770
Bye-bye!

3197
02:26:34,910 --> 02:26:35,670
Bye-bye!

3198
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:35,830
Bye-bye!
