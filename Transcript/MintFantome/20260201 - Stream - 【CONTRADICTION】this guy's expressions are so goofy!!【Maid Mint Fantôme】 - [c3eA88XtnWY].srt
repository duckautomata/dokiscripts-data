00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,770
Hello everybody welcome to welcome in!

2
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,490
Mimi!

3
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,410
Hello!

4
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,250
Hello everybody!

5
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,910
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

6
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,910
Hi!

7
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:30,910
Hello!

8
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,450
Happy weekend!

9
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,190
Happy, happy weekend!

10
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,190
I hope you guys have been having a good one.

11
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,970
How are we doing?

12
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,350
How are we doing?

13
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,510
How are we doing?

14
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,050
Love this game so much.

15
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,630
Actor is peaking everything.

16
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,910
Saw your body.

17
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,910
I'm really happy that you enjoyed Ace Combat 7.

18
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,010
I have a lot of respect for that game despite not being my
favorite in the series.

19
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,950
That's a lot of people have said.

20
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,030
But since it's the only one that I've played, of course I
can not.

21
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,510
I have to say it's my favorite.

22
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,430
So far.

23
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,510
So far.

24
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,810
Snowed in.

25
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,310
Stay warm.

26
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,290
Stay warm.

27
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,370
Me too.

28
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,450
I'm staying warm.

29
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,970
I've been drinking, I've just been like chugging warm drinks
all day.

30
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,310
Otherwise my ectoplasm will freeze.

31
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,850
Hello, Amito and I booze like you.

32
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,850
I hope your day has been good so far.

33
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,350
My ice fishing tournament got cancelled because the ice got
too thin.

34
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,490
Well, I thought you were about to say because of the ice,
which I was going to say that's so ironic.

35
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,010
No!

36
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,530
Already?

37
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,030
Siberia!

38
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,970
Welcome to Babusha, thank you.

39
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,410
I'm stoked always wanted to see this game in action.

40
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,070
Tim Folin's music is the cherry on top.

41
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,330
Well, you'll see it in action.

42
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,530
Literally live action.

43
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,330
We're gonna see real people.

44
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,090
Flesh.

45
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,570
Fleshies.

46
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,130
Flesh...

47
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,950
Actual...

48
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,610
Like if...

49
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,470
Okay, take a mirror.

50
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,610
Look at yourself.

51
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,270
That's what we'll be seeing.

52
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,330
You.

53
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,930
You've been stuck in the game.

54
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:13,930
Wake up.

55
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,730
Wake up.

56
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,950
Y'all are in for a treat.

57
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,230
This game is a gem.

58
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,530
I'm excited.

59
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,890
I mean, that was my birthday.

60
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,090
I turned redacted.

61
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,890
Could I get a happy birthday?

62
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:26,670
Sedario!

63
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,910
Happy birthday!

64
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,150
Happy, happy birthday!

65
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,190
Happy birthday!

66
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,330
The game kind of saved the franchise, though.

67
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,750
It could be the...

68
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:37,950
Wait.

69
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,350
It could have been the last game in the series.

70
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,110
too it went through multiple delays yeah I remember I
remember that all the development like hearing about the

71
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:57,590
development how that it went through yeah genuinely thought
that said chef clues oh you said you said that and then I

72
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:09,830
also saw I was like I I saw it but I also processed the chef
we should hold I'm gonna read the case background info and

73
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,750
then we will watch the prologue because I haven't watched it
yet or anything.

74
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,550
The victim.

75
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:26,490
Kate Vine was a PhD student found drowned at midnight last
Friday in a lake in the woods on the outskirts of the tiny

76
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,770
village of Edenton.

77
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:34,470
I don't know why I assumed that oh my gosh her dimples are
so cute.

78
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,450
She's so cute.

79
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,910
I assumed that this was going to be like a Scooby-Doo case,
not a murder.

80
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:50,230
The lab report indicated a high level of alcohol in her
blood at the time of death, along with traces of morphine.

81
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,430
The alcohol is consistent with her medical records, which
reveal a history of depression and alcoholism.

82
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,290
Oh, no, Kate.

83
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,790
However, the origin of the morphine remains a mystery.

84
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,810
It goes places.

85
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,470
Oh, I'm so...

86
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,130
I know nothing.

87
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,010
I'm so excited.

88
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,150
I'm ready to go, places.

89
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:18,550
places take me places so Scooby-Doo Kate had joined a
controversial business course called Atlas based in a large

90
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:36,870
stately home just outside the village oh oh wait British who
says village wait a second oh wait British Kate we are so

91
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,730
British.

92
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,510
Someone call Vicky.

93
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,690
Get her people.

94
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,370
Kate had been attending the course on the night of her
death.

95
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,730
Atlas is run by father and son, teen Paul and Ryan Rand.

96
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,170
Paul and Ryan Rand.

97
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:04,210
Both were interviewed following Kate's death, but neither
claimed to have seen Kate after the meeting and both were

98
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,010
understandably eager to distance themselves and from the
tragedy.

99
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,930
This isn't the first time Atlas has been investigated.

100
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,050
Oh, oh.

101
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,130
Rumors have been circulating for years surrounding Atlas and
their questionable methods, which many have suggested border

102
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,990
on mind control.

103
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,270
Where can I sign up?

104
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,550
Rebecca Rand.

105
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,530
Ryan is married to Rebecca.

106
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,670
Landlady.

107
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,230
Landlady You have Edenton's village pub.

108
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,290
Oh, no, you're so British.

109
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,140
The George and Dragon.

110
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,640
As yet, she hasn't been interviewed.

111
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,880
Me too?

112
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,860
Hi, that's me.

113
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,260
Yes, yes.

114
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,860
As the hub of the village, the pub...

115
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,000
The hub of the...

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,240
The hub is the pub.

117
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,440
The pub will have been known to most of the villagers and
Rebecca has often hosted local bands and village events.

118
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,260
Also, given Kate's alcoholism, it's likely she visited the
pub on more than one occasion.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,060
The only place to drink in town.

120
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,480
Okay, it's not even a town.

121
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,240
It's a village.

122
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,540
Only place to drink in village.

123
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,800
Simon and Emma.

124
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,560
We're getting the whole cat.

125
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,480
Look at the...

126
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,800
This is what's it called?

127
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,060
The...

128
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,480
The...

129
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,120
The shot.

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,120
The...

131
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,920
the headshot.

132
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,240
This is the headshot.

133
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,400
I appreciate you lots.

134
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,840
We tell your voice and energy always lives my spirits.

135
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,640
Keep warm.

136
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,900
You too, Phoenix.

137
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,320
Thank you.

138
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,820
Rocky.

139
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,820
Welcome to Mambusha, back you.

140
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,300
Who's Emma?

141
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,340
E.

142
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,980
E.

143
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,460
No, it's E.

144
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,120
E.

145
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,120
B.

146
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,000
Emma Bowman.

147
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:00,720
E.

148
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,300
One of Kate's friends from college was Emma Bowman.

149
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,300
who lives with boyfriend Simon at Eden Lodge on the road to
the woods.

150
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,520
Simon Thompson met Emma at university.

151
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,100
After completing his degree 18 months ago, he went to work
at a shop in the neighboring village.

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,240
I'm not going to remember any of these people, I think.

153
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,540
I think so.

154
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,040
Uh-huh, me-duh.

155
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,300
Uh-huh.

156
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,200
Uh-huh.

157
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,160
I agree.

158
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,860
Emma was shocked to hear of Kate's death.

159
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,260
She didn't attend Atlas, but Simon joined a few months ago.

160
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,920
I didn't see Kate after the meeting but seemed unmoved by
her death.

161
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,560
You are feeling very yabai.

162
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,000
Am I getting hypnotized?

163
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,120
Are you trying to hypnotize me?

164
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,120
I have a mind of steel, baby.

165
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,280
Mind of steel.

166
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,760
You'll get nothing out of me.

167
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,840
Yeah, Nan, I'll be playing Ace Combat.

168
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,980
Hopefully soon.

169
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm excited for 8 too.

170
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,220
If Minto haunted an elevator, she could have her spirit
lifted too.

171
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,340
That sounds dangerously close to going to heaven.

172
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Also, I think you should check out the game Who's Lila?

173
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,940
You might like it.

174
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,340
Oh.

175
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,380
Why do you think I might like it?

176
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,140
Shall we watch the pro lot?

177
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,640
Wait a second.

178
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,340
Oh, okay.

179
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:27,840
This is the...

180
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,480
I was like, wait.

181
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,960
Where do we start the game?

182
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,300
Hold on.

183
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,580
Let me read the instructions too.

184
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,160
Kate Vine drowned in a lake in the woods just outside.

185
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,500
Oh wow, the pub.

186
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Wow, wow!

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
We're going!

188
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,220
We're going to the UK!

189
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Last, last Friday night.

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,780
Last, last Friday night.

191
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,800
The game starts one week later.

192
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
On Friday at 5 p.m.

193
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,280
You can guide...

194
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
I thought this said jerks.

195
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,720
We're taking jerks around the village in two ways.

196
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,660
You can follow the direction arrows to move to adjacent
locations.

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,260
Okay, so it's just like a point and click.

198
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,080
That's easy.

199
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,760
Hello, Kate.

200
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,080
When you're waiting at a location, you can open your
inventory, scroll through your collected items, which

201
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,680
includes physical objects and information.

202
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,120
Jerks has collected.

203
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,800
That's his name now.

204
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,960
That's his name.

205
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,660
Physical items can sometimes be used.

206
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,660
The hand symbol is shown, which you can select, okay?

207
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,700
I probably...

208
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:31,940
Hold on.

209
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,700
You can also see previous replies.

210
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,200
to each item.

211
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,140
I either clicking beneath the description or pressing the
left controller.

212
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,900
They expect me to play this game with a controller?

213
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,180
What did this come out on?

214
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,640
Wait.

215
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,420
Huh?

216
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,220
What?

217
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,080
It's a investigation time with Minto.

218
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:49,820
Yeah.

219
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,520
Jogs.

220
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,380
The jogsler.

221
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,960
The jengsler.

222
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,340
The jerksler.

223
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,460
It's the one and only PS5 game.

224
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,100
It's five exclusive.

225
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,400
Astro Bot.

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,680
Astro Bot.

227
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,780
Astro Bot.

228
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,620
I am out.

229
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,480
Okay, we got this.

230
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,900
I've played games before.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's watch the prologue.

232
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,920
My name is Jenks.

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Detective Inspector Frederick Jenks.

234
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,820
I thought it was one name man.

235
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,260
I've been assigned to a last minute investigation into the
death of Kate Vine.

236
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,880
A PhD student.

237
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:42,840
found drowned at midnight last Friday in a lake in the woods
on the outskirts of the tiny village of Edenton I have until

238
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:50,540
first thing tomorrow morning to decide whether her death was
a simple accident or whether this was murder murder Kate

239
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Vine appeared to the world to be a bright confident
fun-loving PhD student with everything to live for tomorrow

240
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:07,540
yeah what a history of depression and alcoholism revealed in
her medical records suggests that in reality she Oh my god,

241
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,140
we went inside!

242
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,060
Oh my god, we went inside!

243
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,480
Along with the late hour of her death, and a lack of
witnesses, makes a strong case that this was suicide.

244
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,820
But the verdict overlooked some curious details.

245
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,280
Curious.

246
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,000
Why was her driving license found on the opposite side of
the lake in which she drowned?

247
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,500
Oh!

248
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,500
Also, there were traces of morphine in Kate's sister.

249
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,840
Where did she get it?

250
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,520
Kate was known to be a free spirit with a nihilistic love of
danger, in part have something to do with a business course

251
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,920
called atlas which kate had joined and which she had been
attending on the night of her death based in a large stately

252
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:52,240
home on the outskirts of the village the exclusive atlas is
run by father and son team paul and ryan rand both were

253
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,580
interviewed following a lot of information really is this a
problem after the meeting and both were understandably eager

254
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,600
to distance themselves and atlas from the tragedy i'm so
curious this isn't What about exploring your past

255
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,000
experience?

256
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,820
Childhood.

257
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,580
What's month five?

258
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,020
What's month five?

259
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,500
Mourning your past!

260
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,880
Taking control of your life!

261
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,160
Ryan is married to Rebecca, landlady of Edenton's village
pub, the George and Dragon.

262
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,040
I feel like we're watching like a Netflix documentary.

263
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,940
Or like a...

264
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,780
Or like one of those true crime YouTube channels or
something.

265
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:30,060
One of Kate's friends was Emma Bowman, who lives at Eden
Lodge on the road leading out of Edenton Village.

266
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,660
BBC documentary, yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,960
But didn't attend Atlas.

268
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,820
Interviewed after Kate's death, Emma seemed shocked and
upset, insisting she hadn't seen Kate that night.

269
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,900
This is all that I just read earlier.

270
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
Simon Thompson met Emma at university.

271
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,700
After completing his degree around 18 months ago, he went to
work at a shop in the neighboring village.

272
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,520
But he doesn't care about a few months ago.

273
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,420
Or not Emma.

274
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,360
Simon insisted that he didn't see Kate after the meeting.

275
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:07,440
interviewing him noted he seemed oddly unmoved by her death
which makes him the first person I want to see tonight Okay,

276
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,160
it's time for some answers Yeah, baby.

277
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,540

278
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,280
Yeah, it's time for some answers.

279
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:26,200

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,470

It's not letting me click.

288
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,990
Okay, I think I have to reset the game.

289
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,910
Oh, it's not letting me reset the game.

290
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,910
Can I exit the game?

291
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,530
Oh, no.

292
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,790
Wait, I'm stuck in the game.

293
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,290

Oh, shoot.

Uh.

298
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,220
The first puzzle.

299
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,160
Oh, my gosh.

300
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,640

301
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,740

Sorry.

304
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,380
Maybe that will restart it.

305
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,720
No.

306
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,640
My keyboard works, as you can see.

307
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,740
A true detective clears all hurdles.

308
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,340
and enter?

309
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:31,900
No.

310
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:40,060
Okay, I'm just gonna task manager close the game.

311
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,340
I think it's this one.

312
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,980
What is this called?

313
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,880
Contradict... It has to be this one.

314
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,160
Okay.

315
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:47,980

But that's fine.

318
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,340
That's fine.

319
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,500
A bit of a rocky stuff.

320
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,440
Exit game.

321
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,140

Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good.

327
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,110
And you guys get to see the sick intro.

328
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,910
It's kind of fun.

329
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,690
Wait, so this is the lake I just got.

330
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,870
Freaky, freaky.

331
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,050
No, no, Janks, no.

332
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:46,910
If I click to exit, a sign to a last-minute investigation
into the death of Kate Vine, a PhD student found drowned at

333
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,670
midnight last Friday.

334
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,430
Okay, I'm clicking the exit.

335
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,270
Don't take me back to the title.

Okay, we're good.

Yeah, everyone take notes.

339
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,690
Is this a notes-taking game?

340
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,690
I think it's the type of game that will take the notes for
me, it seems like.

341
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,970

363
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,260
this game was made by the tim fallen the guy who made the
nes picture theme.

364
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,140
Among many other video game theme songs for the NES.

365
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,760
Oh, what?

366
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,560
Crazy.

367
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:01,960
Uh, we're going, okay, I think it's, uh, how, hold on, I
want to go down this way and see what we have here, though.

368
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,360
The Village Hall.

369
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,460
What's this?

370
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,840
Oh, okay, so this pops up.

371
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,900
Okay, we can, oh.

372
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,460
Oh, always nice to randomly find a key on the floor.

373
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,700
So true, Janks.

374
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:29,440

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:40,440
that interesting why you gotta play at dead of night too
wait is it the same team that game scares me i don't think i

376
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,460
could ever play that game it makes me have like oh my gosh i
get i get i get jumpy like crazy with it.

377
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,700
Oh, same devs at that of nine.

378
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,100
The lack of setting is because the entire game is one big
long video file.

379
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,440
Oh, that makes sense.

380
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:58,820
Wow!

381
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,760
Oh my gosh, we get another view!

382
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Look at the castle!

383
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,880
Oh, it's so cute!

384
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,040
This way.

385
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,960
Here we go.

386
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,280
Minto is British now.

387
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,120
Oh, Minto, Janks.

388
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,240
Thank goodness you're here.

389
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,120
Oh no!

390
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,200
Let's see.

391
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
Okay, the Eden Lodge.

392
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,080
Knock for Simon.

393
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,660
Oh, what are we investigating first?

394
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,300
A bike.

395
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,500
Does it got dirt on it from the lake?

396
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,080
Very trusting, leaving a bike unlocked.

397
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,740
I am the one who steals it.

398
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,060
Homebrew equipment.

399
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,360
Oh, we're just digging through the garbage now.

400
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,100
Ah.

401
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,600
Ah.

402
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,380
This might come in handy.

403
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,980
Oh, okay, we're stealing their things now.

404
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,760
Oh.

405
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,820
Okay.

406
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,850
It was in the garbage right here, so it's fine.

407
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,050
I'm surprised we're not, like, looking, peering through the
windows and everything.

408
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,090
Oh, Simon.

409
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,410
Simon.

410
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,170
Is it Simon?

411
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,330
Uh, yeah.

412
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,050
Detective Inspector Jenks.

413
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,030
I'm investigating an incident in the village.

414
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,510
Could I come in and ask you a few questions, please?

415
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,170
Yeah.

416
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:18,870

00:25:46,990 --> 00:26:10,030

of times I say ask when you've heard the reply you'll see a

422
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,410
summary of of what was said in the bottom.

423
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,310
Oh, in the box at the bottom.

424
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,350
Simon said blah, blah, blah.

425
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,150
He also said blah, blah.

426
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,710
And he said blah, blah de blah.

427
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,810
Alan Wake writing.

428
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,950
Clicking any item you've already asked about shows the
summary of replies beneath.

429
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,070
Oh, that's handy.

430
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,850
Now click any reply to add it to the contradiction box on
the right.

431
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,930
Oh, wait, maybe I should move.

432
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,730
Like this.

433
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,550
Oh, but then I think I'm blocking the subtitles more.

434
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,170
Alright, guys, we're on the left side today.

435
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,230
Perhaps.

436
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,650
Yeah,

437
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,920
this is fine, probably.

438
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,500
This company also did another mystery FMV called The
Infectious Madness of Dr. Decker.

439
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,880
And I highly recommend it.

440
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,720
That sounds fine.

441
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,240
Misadventure Mysteries?

442
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,040
Yes.

443
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,200
Okay, one second.

444
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,220
Wait.

445
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,480
That should be okay.

446
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,280
That should be okay.

447
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,500
Okay, sorry, I'm repositioning some things on my computer.

448
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,020
This game rules have
5-me-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-I'm

449
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,480
excited.

450
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:42,560
Okay.

451
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,740
Contradiction box.

452
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,240
You can start looking...

453
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,680
Now you can start looking for contradictions.

454
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,420
We haven't even asked anything yet.

455
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,080
I don't think we can search.

456
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:57,900
for we can i don't think we can look at all fine two
contradictory replies and add them to the contradiction box

457
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,200
if they go green sit back and watch jenks interrogate your
interviewee

458
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:16,420
so ask about okay i noticed a lot of bottles outside are
they yours yeah i'll make home room for yourself well no i

459
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:22,240
give it out to my friends and stuff i tried selling it at
first but i didn't have any takers except for james over at

460
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,720
farmhouse because It's bad.

461
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,780
I used to trade it to him for herbs and stuff.

462
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,340
Herbs.

463
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,480
Do you see James a lot?

464
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,920
No, not really.

465
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,220
Hmm.

466
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,840
So we have all these things here too.

467
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,270
Simon told Janks about his homebrew.

468
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,630
Let's see.

469
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,110
When was the last time you saw Kate Vine?

470
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:50,830
Herbs.

471
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,750
Um, so last Friday's meeting, I think.

472
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,370
Did you see her after the meeting?

473
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:57,730
No.

474
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:58,550
No.

475
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,810
How long have you known, Kate?

476
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,130
That would be when we started Atlas.

477
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,090
Three months ago?

478
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,550
Did you socialize outside Atlas?

479
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,590
No.

480
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,730
How do you describe her?

481
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,910
The og thing, this thing.

482
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,650
What sort of person was she?

483
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,730
Well, she's talented.

484
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,950
She was full of life, you know.

485
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,510
Sharp, quite sharp.

486
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,530
Would you say she had any emotional problems?

487
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,390
She, her mood, her mood could change.

488
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,850
And, well, there was the drinking problem.

489
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,570
When did you become aware of that?

490
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,730
Well, she would come drunk to a meeting sometimes.

491
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,150
Oh, no.

492
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,930
She would reek of the stuff.

493
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,950
Oh, it might be a pig.

494
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,610
It looks like, I thought it was a she, but you know.

495
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,690
It might be a pig.

496
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,710
Tell me a bit about that.

497
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,190
That was just a business management training program for
post grads.

498
00:29:51,510 --> 00:30:00,310
and you started this after you left college uh yeah and it's

driver's license dropped silver key it isn't worth worth

501
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:35,410
asking okay we're gonna ask about his bicycle hmm simon have
you checked on your bicycle in the past 30 minutes uh you

502
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:43,870
know last i saw it was unlocked and that's not very wise
there could be someone who has come over and uh you know

503
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:52,850
seen that it was unlocked and so hmm where's the bike
outside Oh, that's my cousin's.

504
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,850
He lent me it.

505
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,470
I need to buy a new lock for it, though.

506
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,930
So it's your bike at the moment.

507
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,710
Yeah, yeah.

508
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,790
There's no bus service to speak of around here, so it's
really the only way to get around.

509
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,910
Uh-huh.

510
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,730
Bike is the only way Simon can get to work.

511
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,110
This town is small.

512
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,710
It really is a village.

513
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,070
Asking because he's going to steal it later.

514
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,090
100%.

515
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,950
100%.

516
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,470
It isn't worth asking Simon about this creature.

517
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,830
screwdriver that we stole.

518
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,970
Simon, have you noticed that you're missing a screwdriver
lately?

519
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,690
We took it!

520
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,730
Wait, a screwdriver was found in a box outside Eden Lodge.

521
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,030
Like, it's not yours.

522
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,650
Oh my gosh, okay, let's ask about the driver's license.

523
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,130
whether Kate had lost this or not.

524
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,190
This is bad boy.

525
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,250
Whip it out.

526
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:00,450
No.

527
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,230
No, I don't think so.

528
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,550
I've never seen it before.

529
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,410
Why do you look at him like that first though?

530
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,630
He doesn't know anything about that.

531
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,130
That was it.

532
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,190
Hold on.

533
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,830
Did you see his face?

534
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,810
Did you know whether Kate had lost this or not?

535
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,030
No.

536
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,760
This?

537
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,700
No, I don't think so.

538
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,360
What was that?

539
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,160
I've never seen it before.

540
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,360
Do you guys know that show?

541
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,520
Oh my gosh.

542
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,480
It's a show.

543
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,480
It's like one of those kind of detective shows.

544
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,360
Except it's about a guy that reads like micro expressions on
people's faces and stuff.

545
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,500
And he like does this thing.

546
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,900
He'll like kind of point at them and like.

547
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,160
Like kind of swipe his finger around.

548
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,120
Be like I see all these micro expressions.

549
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,840
Not the mentalist.

550
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,440
Lie to me.

551
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,080
Lie to me.

552
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,080
Yeah that was the show.

553
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,340
Oh I didn't know that the mentalist was also a similar
story.

554
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,440
Janks always has one eyebrow raised higher than the other.

555
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,640
It's so distracting.

556
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,460
Peak dream workspace moment.

557
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,360
I feel like I'm being the main guy and lie to me right now.

558
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,340
Contradictions.

559
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,540
I don't think we have any contradictions.

560
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,940
We have nothing else to ask either.

561
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,980
So let's go visit Emma, I suppose.

562
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,540
Thank you.

563
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,740

The contradiction.

Emma said she only drinks wine and that she doesn't like
beer.

582
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,360
That's all for the moment.

Interesting.

607
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,700
I thought forensics had checked the whole area.

608
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,120
Obviously not very well.

609
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:58,800
Oh.

610
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,460
Dang.

611
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:10,300
How could they miss this very obvious jewelry that was stuck
in, that was completely wedged into the into the pier like

612
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:20,320
what stupid god they didn't even comb this place with a
metal detector or something crazy take that forensics yeah

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:28,100
we're taking that take that and we're taking your jobs we
already found something we're so good head towards atlas

614
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,360

615
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:43,620

so this is atlas Paul and Ryan Rand are down here.

619
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,040
Let's go to Atlas, I guess.

620
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,000
See if we can get in.

621
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,080
Oh, we're just standing in the woods.

622
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,380
I mean, I guess that's how we got here.

623
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,540
Oh, we're going in.

624
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,400
Okay, let's go in.

625
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,520
Just kidding.

626
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,420
I have to come back later, I think.

627
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,420
Dang, he's like, he's yanking on that thing.

628
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,560
He's like, maybe it'll break.

629
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,520
just like the lock on Simon's bike.

630
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,300
Everybody in this village uses weak locks.

631
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,020
We need the lock-picking lawyer stat.

632
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,440
That guy would get this open in two seconds.

633
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,160
Try the key!

634
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,520
Oh my gosh, wait, you're so right.

635
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,350
No, it says we can't.

636
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,110
Dang.

637
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,750
We're not ready to break an entry, I guess.

638
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:09,870
Okay.

639
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:10,970
Clearing.

640
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,830
Look, you can see the parts in the water.

641
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,460
It's kind of eerie how some things move and some things
don't, you know what I mean?

642
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,680
We didn't go the other opposite way.

643
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,400
Yeah, this one.

644
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,240
Okay.

645
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,100
Just another part.

646
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,900
All right.

647
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,340
Part of the lake.

648
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,200
We got that.

649
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,060
Woods Lane.

650
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,540

653
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,940

I thought I could, like, maybe unlock this.

660
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,460
I love the walking animation.

661
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,880
So, it's not even animation, but you know what I mean.

662
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,820
Call the chief.

663
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,520

What if her?

670
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,540
I think her death was a sacrifice.

671
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,820
I think it has to be.

672
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,240
I think her death has to be a sacrifice for the Atlas
ritual.

673
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,140
Hello, hello, hello.

674
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,920

It's called a freedom necklace.

700
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,970
A freedom necklace.

701
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:00,510
No?

702
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,930
Not at all.

703
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,450
Wait, so...

704
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,910
So the necklace did belong to Kate.

705
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:05,890
Interesting.

706
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,470
I'm starting to wish I'd brought a spare evidence bag.

707
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,170
Alex James, London, Paris, New York.

708
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,110
Designed in Puta.

709
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,270
So she gave her like a necklace?

710
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:20,630
Wait.

711
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,610
kind of an odd gift?

712
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:24,930
No?

713
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,990
I mean, I don't think it's odd to gift someone jewelry.

714
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,290
I think it's...

715
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:36,350
I think, I don't know, maybe more odd that she got it as a
gift and like...

716
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,830
and like gave it away to a friend.

717
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,950
It's the re-gifting.

718
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,650
Yeah, that's how I feel about it.

719
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,710
Hmm.

720
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,750
Unwanted gift.

721
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,370
Okay, that's it for now.

722
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,150
Thank you.

723
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:52,910
Thank you.

724
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:02,890
um does simon know anything about it a couple more questions
if that's okay i don't think he does you should ask about

725
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:10,650
the freedom necklace rather yeah that's what i was about to
do yeah you know what this is yeah yeah i think amma had one

726
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:17,030
like it actually you know what kate had one i remember
because i asked her about it one night when we were all out

727
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:26,710
drinking in college i was probably pretty drunk that's what
college is all about Kate wore the necklace at college.

728
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,230
Okay.

729
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:32,630
Wait.

730
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,090
Thank you.

731
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,430
Probably be back later.

732
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,870
I should probably ask Emma about the card itself.

733
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:37,510
My bad.

734
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:38,870
Wait.

735
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,510
I forgot to ask her.

736
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:40,870
Emma!

737
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:41,970
Let me...

738
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,210
I'm imagining like crawling through her window.

739
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:46,750
You know?

740
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,270
Oh, okay, okay.

741
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:49,690
Never mind.

742
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,390
We don't need to.

743
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:50,990
Okay, cool.

744
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,790
Thank you.

745
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,930
Probably be back later.

746
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,010
The graphics look so lifelike.

747
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,790
I know, it's crazy, right?

748
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,150
Wow, we're truly in the future.

749
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,390
Okay.

750
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,010
Now let's go to the pub.

751
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,350
Let's see if there's the key we can use.

752
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,770
I don't know, though.

753
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:14,870
Nope.

754
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,210
Because all I do is knock here.

755
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,250
Yeah, and it just kicks me out.

756
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:22,730
Okay.

757
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,770
Hi, hi, Minto.

758
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,650
Ritual sacrifice reminds me of the Wickerman.

759
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:29,730
Nicholas Cage is out.

760
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,950
They're screaming, not the bees.

761
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,330
Yeah, probably.

762
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:34,930
Probably.

763
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,050
This is the British version of...

764
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,130
Ah, one more thing.

765
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,070
Unreal Engine 7!

766
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,190
Wow.

767
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,130
First look.

768
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:50,270
Hmm.

769
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,050
We haven't even met anybody else.

770
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,630
what's my thing you know

771
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:07,730
what was here the village hall hello hello hello

772
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:21,670
it's a sleepy village yeah so sleepy oh you should call the
chief for an update okay I'm gonna use the hints a little

773
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:33,890
bit more often while I get used to the game itself but okay
phone box call the chief now he'll answer now he wants to

774
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:34,590
talk to me

775
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:53,070
hello hello hello hello hello I've questioned Simon Thompson
and Emma Bowman so far I found a pendant by the lake which

776
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:59,870
turns out to have been Emma's but Emma gave it to Kate so
chances are Kate was wearing it the night she drowned what

777
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,830
does Thompson know about it Simon doesn't seem to know much
I don't Trust Thompson.

778
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,370
Yeah.

779
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,970
But again, I don't trust Emma that much either.

780
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:06,390
Oh.

781
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,610
Try and get a bit of background on them.

782
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,790
You know, usual stuff.

783
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,170
When did Emma meet Kate?

784
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,890
How long have they known each other?

785
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,440
Give me a call back when you've got some more.

786
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,120
Thanks, Chief.

787
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:18,880
Weary.

788
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,740
Okay, thanks, Chief.

789
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,100
Okay, we're going back to knock and all.

790
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:23,540
Oh, my gosh.

791
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,700
They're going to get so sick of me.

792
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:30,450
Hello.

793
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,650
Hello, Simon.

794
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:32,490
Hello.

795
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,290
Ask you a couple more things, please.

796
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,480
Uh.

797
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,210
Wait...

798
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,690
I thought...

799
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,610
We were gonna ask about more things.

800
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,670
That's all for the moment, thank you.

801
00:48:59,440 --> 00:48:59,900
Okay.

802
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,910
I wanna know, though.

803
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,390
She...

804
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,710
Didn't see Kit very often.

805
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,590
But they were friends, right?

806
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:16,510
Like...

807
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:21,290
How do you know Kate bought lots of new jewelry if you
didn't see her very often?

808
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:23,150
You know?

809
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,410
I'm gonna try it.

810
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,350
I'll try it.

811
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,100
Do I... I guess it... it doesn't work.

812
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,860
I guess if you... hmm.

813
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,320
Let me try it with Simon then because...

814
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,580
Be that later on if that's okay.

815
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,600
They don't say anything.

816
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,700
He just says it himself.

817
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,520
Here, let's see.

818
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,140
Okay, for this though, wore the necklace at college.

819
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,000
Let's see what he said.

820
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,000
Didn't socialize.

821
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,180
Oh, outside of Atlas.

822
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,120
There we go.

823
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,300
There we go.

824
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,610
That's the contradiction.

825
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:07,650
Wait.

826
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,130
It said that he went drinking with her.

827
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:14,530
No.

828
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,230
Thank you.

829
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,670
Probably be back later.

830
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,330
I'm just bouncing from person to person.

831
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,270
That's it for the time being.

832
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,650
You're on the right track.

833
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,470
That's really close.

834
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,230
Okay, maybe it's two different prompts.

835
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,310
This is very at dead of night.

836
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,100
It's always just trying to figure out what prompts to use.

837
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,640
You know?

838
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,100
Um.

839
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,280
I wonder if it's the only known for three months.

840
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,440
And then.

841
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,360
Or the necklace at college.

842
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,980
Ah!

843
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,880
Ah!

844
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:01,300
Ah!

845
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:01,580
Oh!

846
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,100
Oh!

847
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,840
So how did you know Kate was wearing a freedom necklace 18
months ago?

848
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,000
At college.

849
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:08,740
Hey, yeah.

850
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:16,080
Well, I knew Kate at college, but I didn't get to know her
till we started at Atlas.

851
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:16,880
Right.

852
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,320
So you didn't socialize with her at college?

853
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,540
No.

854
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,060
And you didn't socialize with her outside of Atlas?

855
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,120
No.

856
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,600
But you went drinking with her?

857
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,800
at all.

858
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:30,760
Um...

859
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,740
No, no, not at all.

860
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,840
Oh my god!

861
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,660
6 p.m.

862
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,700
So Simon did know Kate at college, but why would he lie
about that?

863
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,460
Maybe he knows Kate better than he's willing to admit.

864
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,580
Six o'clock.

865
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,500
I wonder if Rebecca's working in the pub tonight.

866
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,500
Ah, okay.

867
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,720
I'm gonna eat some goldfish.

868
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,260
Sorry, guys.

869
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,320
I got them extra cheesy goldfish.

870
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,060
They're so good.

871
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,560
They are the best kind, aren't they?

872
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,420
Okay, what do we got around here?

873
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:09,580
Oh.

874
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:11,620
Hmm?

875
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,700
A broken window recently smashed by the look of it.

876
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,140
Might have to ask about that.

877
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,600
Interesting.

878
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,380
Is that being held by washi tape?

879
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,700
What else is that?

880
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,240
Oh.

881
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:26,660
Oh.

882
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,100
What did I just do?

883
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,800
Oh, broken pub window.

884
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,440
Okay, cool.

885
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,440
So we can enter the out building.

886
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:35,880
Ah!

887
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,200
Ah!

888
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,180
No, no, no!

889
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,220
Yes, yes, yes.

890
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,670
Yes, yes, this has to be the key.

891
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,840
Yes.

892
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,520
Mm-hmm,

893
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,920
mm-hmm.

894
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,060
Yeah, this is pretty illegal.

895
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,380
Ugh.

896
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,800
What the hell?

897
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,980
I wonder whose mask this is.

898
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,280
Rebecca's or Ryan's?

899
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,480
They're doing sacrifices.

900
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,460
They're doing sacrifices.

901
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,140
They're doing...

902
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,520
They're doing ritual sacrifices.

903
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,840
Oh no.

904
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,500
Oh no, I never thought we were so right!

905
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:29,520
What?

906
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,600
Oh no!

907
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,260
We're so...

908
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,380
Cult, cult, cult!

909
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,900
Just looks like junk, but it's too dark to tell.

910
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,960
Uh oh, we need a flashlight and come back, okay.

911
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,280
These look like giant leaks, don't they?

912
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,500
Everybody's cosplaying Hatsune Miku.

913
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,640
It's not a crime because he has a hat.

914
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:59,700
on if law and order has taught me anything likely they were
in an activist group together and one night he assaulted her

915
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:11,620
she recognized him and she was going to report him oh my
gosh wait why does that sound like a probability okay

916
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:25,620
let's get out of here before we're caught I wonder if
they're gonna be like how do you know about this mask don't

917
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,500
worry about it

918
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,950
Not sure if it's technically B&E, but it's at least
trespassing.

919
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:35,550
You know what?

920
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:35,870
That's fair.

921
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:36,290
That's fair.

922
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,990
Press the bell.

923
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,730
Ding-o-ling-ling.

924
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,430
No, let's go to the restaurant first.

925
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:44,130
Oh.

926
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,430
Nothing here.

927
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:48,910
Nothing here.

928
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:55,610
There's a lot of ghostly voices happening for nobody in this
area.

929
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,310
Hmm.

930
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,130
Curious.

931
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:12,430
nothing to report sorry what can i get you detective

934
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,410
if you've heard The student?

935
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,150
Yes.

936
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,150
Yeah, so it's dreadful news.

937
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,290
You're married to Ryan, one of the Atlas leaders, yes?

938
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:41,550
I'm sorry, this place is small enough that everybody knows
everybody and all I mean.

939
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:46,290
Well, I just wanted to ask a few questions about Kate and
Atlas, if that's okay.

940
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:49,670
I don't know if I'll be able to answer any of them, but
sure.

941
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,710
Ibu Locksmith here.

942
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:58,570
That silver key, Yale key, literally can't go into that
master padlock.

943
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,110
Just one of those things you notice because of profession.

944
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,080
That's amazing.

945
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,000
Thank you for your insight.

946
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,680
Ghostly voices.

947
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,220
Minto Jenks might have some questions for you.

948
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,560
Did you know Kate?

949
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,060
Not very well.

950
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,920
She came in a few times, but she was quite a moody person.

951
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,440
You could tell she had problems.

952
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,500
Was she about to call in?

953
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,040
When was the last time you saw her?

954
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,920
Something not very nice.

955
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,100
Friday.

956
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,000
She popped in for a minute.

957
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,460
And when was that?

958
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,640
Seven-ish.

959
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,160
Was she on her own?

960
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:39,520
Seven-ish.

961
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,820
I didn't see who she was with.

962
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,200
She put £20 on the bar and then left.

963
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,700
What was that for?

964
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,920
A breakage, presumably.

965
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,140
£20?

966
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,600
Just for a beer glass?

967
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,860
Well, she was very drunk.

968
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,460
She just put it on the bar and then walked out.

969
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,220
Was there a broken glass?

970
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,240
Not that I noticed.

971
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,920
But she was a strange girl.

972
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:05,320
Okay.

973
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,540
Give Rebecca 20 pounds for a breakage.

974
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,480
Was it the window?

975
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,100
Was it the window that she accidentally broke?

976
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:19,620
Huh.

977
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,000
Have you seen this before?

978
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,840
What do you plan?

979
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,600
So you didn't know if Kate had lost it.

980
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,260
Oh, so you're not checking her ID to make sure she's of
legal age to drink?

981
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,520
Okay.

982
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,160
Wow, that's suspicious.

983
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,120
That's suspicious, too.

984
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,960
Oh, yeah.

985
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,080
Yeah, you didn't card her?

986
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,260
Actually, do they...

987
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:53,060
I know that the age of drinking is lower in Britain, too,
right?

988
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,180
So...

989
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,640
Do they card ever?

990
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,150
18.

991
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,870
It's more lax there.

992
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:06,970
Oh.

993
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,070
My ID doesn't get checked.

994
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,080
I'm thinking with my tiny world experience.

995
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,260
Simon's homebrew.

996
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,520
Yeah, do you know about this?

997
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,320
Know anything about Simon Thompson's homebrew?

998
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,020
Because he makes homebrew.

999
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,140
Apparently.

1000
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:36,620
No, we do buy from a microbrewery, but we don't usually buy
from kitchen breweries.

1001
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,320
Why?

1002
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:57,660
about it does she buy simon's homebrew clearly not huh um
yeah do you know about this do you recognize this i've seen

1003
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:04,680
students wearing them has some sort of meaning doesn't it i
forget what it is now i've seen anyone wearing one recently

1004
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:19,300
not that i can remember okay okay your window is broken how
did the window get broken out around the back I don't

1005
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:25,540
actually know someone said two girls were arguing outside I
found out after they'd gone and when was this?

1006
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:31,380
last Friday just after we opened about half past six I'll
take over it until I can get it fixed we don't want people

1007
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,840
getting cut and sealing us does that sort of thing happen a
lot?

1008
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:49,500
no not really there's only two girls in town I don't think
are um suitable okay last friday approximately 6 30.

1009
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,910
when did she come in did it say

1010
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:13,080
come on is she stupid kate came to the pub around seven your
window was oh my god how did you not put two and two

1011
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,680
together.

1012
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:27,420
Also, you have a very suspicious creepy mask in there that I
found outside the pub and not in a storage that was

1013
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,600
padlocked.

1014
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,720
Do you know what this is?

1015
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,160
Oh, you'll have to ask Ryan about that.

1016
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,300
So this is Ryan's.

1017
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,880
It's to do with one of Ryan's methods on the course.

1018
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:43,980
Well...

1019
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,420
Go on.

1020
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,080
Masks allow you to play it being someone different for a
while.

1021
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,120
Students find it quite liberating.

1022
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,280
So this would be for a student.

1023
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,340
I think that one's Ryan's, but students do wear them, yes.

1024
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,800
And the creepy symbols on the top?

1025
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,420
The creepy symbols...

1026
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,380
We know why Rebecca isn't a detective.

1027
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,340
Yeah.

1028
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,980
Very, very interesting.

1029
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:24,800
I'm gonna I'm gonna try and do this seven maybe I don't know
it's not a contradiction but it is a connection no okay

1030
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:36,540
thank you probably be back later anyone at the restaurant
now nope okay just a little peek just a little all right we

1031
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,100
can leave how do we find Ryan now

1032
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,140
Um...

1033
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:46,420
Hmm.

1034
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,680
Actually, I'm gonna go ask...

1035
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,080
We're gonna go ask Emma about the, uh...

1036
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,440
About the window.

1037
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,220
Let's see if she knows anything.

1038
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:02,760
Oh, Emma!

1039
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:02,980
Emma!

1040
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,640
Just a few more questions if you don't mind.

1041
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,660
Yeah, Jake says I asked Emma about the...

1042
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,080
The stinking window.

1043
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,860
Know anything about a broken window at the pub around the
back?

1044
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:21,920
pub um a broken window at the back yeah i thought it was
broken when was that i was in the pub on monday with a

1045
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,260
college friend

1046
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:45,810
do pups have wine yeah when you broke it they do i'm gonna
i'm gonna say it's a contradiction we're gonna try it

01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,650

1048
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,960
See if it works.

1049
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:56,920
Ah, ha!

1050
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,420
Okay, never mind.

1051
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,770
Monday before last Friday?

1052
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:06,670
Yeah, right?

1053
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,930
Some serve food and have accommodations.

1054
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:12,790
Wow!

1055
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,890
She's using the solid snake method.

1056
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:17,210
Do not trust!

1057
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,430
Do you know anything about this?

1058
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:21,290
Ever seen this before.

1059
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,650
Ever seen this?

1060
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:24,650
before.

1061
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,050
Nope.

1062
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:26,730
I haven't.

1063
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,670
I think I'd have remembered it.

1064
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,290
Uh-huh.

1065
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,170
Well, we can go ask Simon about it.

1066
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,310
Pubs are more of social clubs than just a bar.

1067
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,950
Oh, okay.

1068
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,770
Pubs in the UK are just like Izakaya.

1069
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,770
Oh.

1070
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:45,790
Fun.

1071
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:47,950
That's all for the moment.

1072
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,670
Thank you.

1073
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:49,830
Simon!

1074
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:51,490
Simon, let me back in.

1075
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,710
Do you know anything about the pro- Do you know anything
about a broken window at the pub?

1076
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,490
No, I don't really go to the pub very often.

1077
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,410
I'm not exactly a pub person.

1078
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,070
Claims he hardly ever visits the pub.

1079
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,250
What about this?

1080
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,050
Have a look at this.

1081
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:11,530
Know anything about that?

1082
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:12,730
I love Janks.

1083
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:13,490
He's so funny.

1084
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:14,810
He's so unserious.

1085
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:15,530
I haven't seen this one.

1086
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,970
But it looks a lot like an Atlas mask.

1087
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,530
We use them for some of the workshops and stuff.

1088
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:22,330
Really?

1089
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:23,510
How?

1090
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:29,390
Well, you have to say something boastful or arrogant.

1091
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:33,490
You do it first without the mask and then you say it with a
mask.

1092
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,350
And the point is?

1093
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,850
Well, it's easier when you have the mask on, isn't it?

1094
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,450
People are not as afraid to be free about themselves, you
know?

1095
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,970
How did you find out about Atlas?

1096
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,030
Well, it was advertised.

1097
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:51,590
Actually, I think I've still got the...

1098
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,210
This is the advert that was at my college.

1099
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,350
The house is so cutely decorated.

1100
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,950
To be honest, I've learned more in three months at Atlas
than I did in three years at business school.

1101
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:01,870
Can I keep that?

1102
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:02,750
Yeah, go for it.

1103
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:03,330
Surely.

1104
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:07,050
That's like when people say that they learn from TikTok.

1105
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:08,610
This is useful as a conversational starter.

1106
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,890
Simon gave Jenks the poster.

1107
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,790
Atlas, life skills training.

1108
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,010
The only thing limiting your future is your past.

1109
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:23,430
The Atlas three-month intensive training course offers you
the chance to learn practical, effective, and highly sought

1110
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:30,470
after real-world business skills recognized by some of the
largest companies and industries in the world easily the

1118
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:08,950
reading room before we go to ryan though let's check
somewhere else let's just snoop around a little bit first

1119
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:23,190
before you know okay this is the reading room with two
chairs facing the wall and blackout curtains and why can't i

1120
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:28,970
see anything outside what are these chairs It doesn't seem
very comfortable.

1121
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:30,730
The reading room.

1122
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:32,110
Hmm.

1123
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,370
You don't read when facing the wall?

1124
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:37,770
I don't read.

1125
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,990
I can't.

1126
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:39,750
Anyway.

1127
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,910
The lounge door.

1128
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:45,950
Hello.

1129
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:47,870
No!

1130
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:51,710
Um.

1131
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,030
Is there anything we can use?

1132
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,480
Slip it under his door.

1133
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,820
Slip this under his door.

1134
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,380
He'll be like, how'd you find my mask?

1135
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,420
Who, how'd you get this?

1136
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,420
There's like a mirror.

1137
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,080
The decorating is quite interesting.

1138
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,520
No way, we can go to Alice and we can't do anything.

1139
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:20,900
Again?

1140
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,240
Please.

1141
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,400
As an avid reader, I can confirm that we do often face the
wall.

1142
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:30,720
Wow.

1143
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:34,660
Very interesting.

1144
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,840
Okay, well.

1145
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,320
Let's leave, hun.

1146
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,940
I wonder if there were any contradictions.

1147
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,660
Meanwhile, she is literally reading everything in the game.

1148
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,900
Can anyone spot the contradiction?

1149
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,960
No, no, no.

1150
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,720
Believe me, believe me.

1151
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:07,400

the chief okay I was thinking about that also have things I

That was fun.

1161
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,820
Oh my gosh.

1162
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,020
Wait, what was the last thing it said?

1163
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:57,440
Oh, yeah, let's go ask Emma real quick about the poster.

1164
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,660
Emma, I'm climbing through your window.

1165
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,340
We don't even need to knock this time.

1166
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,500
We just open it up and start crawling in.

1167
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:06,760
Okay, that's what we say.

1168
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,620
And I have a few more questions as I'm like...

1169
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,360
As I'm just crawling through the window.

1170
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,880
What do you know about Atlas?

1171
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:16,720
Atlas.

1172
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,040
I know that it's a business course.

1173
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:26,340
I went with Simon when he first went, but it wasn't really
my thing.

1174
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:27,820
How often did you go?

1175
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:29,160
Just the once.

1176
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,040
And you decided it wasn't for you?

1177
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,940
Yeah, I'd been to something similar, so decided it wasn't
for me.

1178
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:51,180
similar okay that's it for now thank you that reminds me of
when my friend once was like she was like I have a I'm going

1179
01:11:51,180 --> 01:12:00,320
to this I signed up for this business opportunity place you
need a job right Minto you should come with me and try the

1180
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:07,380
orientation or like the the welcome you know like a the
introduction meeting oh Oh no.

1181
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,220
Yeah, it was 100% in MLM.

1182
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,060
Oh, yeah.

1183
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,240
Yeah, it was an MLM.

1184
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,060
Yeah, it was a it was a it was definitely a pyramid scheme.

1185
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,980
And my friend didn't know a melem.

1186
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,040
That was a melem.

1187
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:37,320
But my mom, like, I was about to say she loved loves MLMs.

1188
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,100
No, she doesn't.

1189
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,760
She like, my mom likes to know about scams.

1190
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:51,280
And so when I told her, I was like, I went to go to this,
this, uh, meeting about this business thing.

1191
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,220
And my mom knew the name immediately.

1192
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:57,040
And she was like, no, tell your friend to quit.

1193
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,740
Get out of there while you still can.

1194
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,260
Yeah.

1195
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,640
Coffee Zilla got her.

1196
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,080
No!

1197
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,840
Minto layered marketing.

1198
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:12,680
Marketing.

1199
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,080
Did I say that right?

1200
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:14,860
Wait, marketing.

1201
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:15,900
Marketing.

1202
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:16,480
Marketing.

1203
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:17,980
Yeah.

1204
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,920
Oh, scary.

1205
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,660
Rebecca, what do you know about Atlas?

1206
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,900
Doesn't seem like... I don't think Atlas is this...

1207
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:26,880
Is it MLM though?

1208
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:30,960
I think Atlas is a cult and they sacrificed Rebecca.

1209
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,200
Ding-a-ling-ing?

1210
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,240
Ding-a-ling-ing.

1211
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,680
Ding-a-ling.

1212
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,680
What do you know about this?

1213
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,580
How about there?

1214
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,660
It's an advertisement.

1215
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:42,540
They had it designed by an agency, I think.

1216
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,660
And when was that?

1217
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:44,820
Last year sometime.

1218
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:46,460
What?

1219
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,520
How do you know that?

1220
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,820
Ryan had the poster designed by an agency.

1221
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,680
The poster was designed last year.

1222
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:55,520
What?

1223
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:04,150
If I ran a self-help cult, what do you think your rules...

1224
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:07,870
Oh, if I ran a self-help cult, what do you think your rules
would be?

1225
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,410
Hmm.

1226
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,970
Oh, she's married to Ryan.

1227
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:14,670
That's right.

1228
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:15,110
I forgot.

1229
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:15,570
Thank you.

1230
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:16,550
Thank you.

1231
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:16,810
Thank you.

1232
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,150
Probably be back later.

1233
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,130
Um, my rules.

1234
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,990
Can't be a bow and a lamb on a cult?

1235
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:26,650
It could be.

1236
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,380
Um, my rules.

1237
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,140
My life, my rules.

1238
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,480
My attitude.

1239
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:42,620
It would be.

1240
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,720
be don't go out at night

1241
01:14:53,030 --> 01:15:15,050
always be lemon stay in the light no oh she heading you know
I saw like a thing recently a video about oh she's got a

1242
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:22,450
she's got it which is you know when you're when you are to
cut it that means you are tired oh she means that you are

1243
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:31,750
getting fatigue of your Oshi, which, which I think, you
know, if you are very passionate about something and you,

1244
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:35,390
you know, it can happen, maybe.

1245
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:38,110
I don't know, I've never felt the fatigue of my Oshi before.

1246
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,410
I don't know.

1247
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,470
That sounds made up.

1248
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:49,630
Apparently, it's like a buzz, not a buzzword, but like a,
it's been kind of catching more popularity than like

1249
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:50,550
Japanese...

1250
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:51,630
Twitter and stuff.

1251
01:15:53,650 --> 01:16:00,490
And, uh, I think, like, yeah, trending, trending, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

1252
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:08,270
Yeah, so it's, it's like a, I guess a burnout when you're
just like, you, I mean, anybody would feel burnout, I feel,

1253
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:17,250
if they are going, going, going with like a hobby or
something, but I would hope that, you know, for, I think in

1254
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:28,310
my case, I, I would hope that you if you're like ah yeah i
feel i'm like i'm always trying to catch minto streams i'm

1255
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:35,990

1256
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:43,510
you're not you're not a bad fan if you miss one stream two
streams five streams ten streams you know like i want to be

tv show that you put on or something you know so don't worry

1258
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:56,250

Thank you!

1262
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:19,210
I don't believe it.

1263
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,490
I'm always loving Vito 110%.

1264
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:22,710
Thank you!

1265
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:26,130
Thank you, but you're never a chore.

1266
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:27,030
Thank you!

1267
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,810
Almost a year, but don't fatigue for me.

1268
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:32,990
Thank you!

1269
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,030
Yeah, I want you guys to...

1270
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:39,510
Like I said, you know, you...

1271
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:41,110
If it helps to think...

1272
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:47,090
I know sometimes people kind of put VTubers in their own
category a little bit, but...

1273
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:52,530
I have like a regular streamer that I watch every day,
almost.

1274
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:56,070
Sometimes he plays games and I'm like, I don't care so much
about this.

1275
01:17:56,570 --> 01:18:07,510
But if I think it's like, if I just kind of treat him as
like a TV show that I put on, then it's like not so, I don't

1276
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,670
know.

1277
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:11,310
You know, I don't feel like I have to watch every day.

1278
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,190
I just kind of watch when I can.

1279
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:14,290
Who?

1280
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:15,950
His name's Incib.

1281
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,310
Wait, Garthamaldi!

1282
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:24,110
He plays a bunch of horror games, so I like to watch the
horror games.

1283
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,390
I like to watch the horror games.

1284
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,950
I have, like, him, and then I watch this other...

1285
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:37,690
He doesn't stream that I know of, but his name is CJU Games.

1286
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:47,070
He's, like, he's, like, my favorite, like, one of my
favorite, like, let's players of the indie, like, horror

1287
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:47,070
games.

1288
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:53,610
game variety and he doesn't have very many but he does
actually though that's a lie he has a lot of subscribers

1289
01:18:53,610 --> 01:19:01,990
like he has over 100k but he recently got to 100k and but
he's so good he's like one of those types that like doesn't

1290
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:08,550
scream and doesn't do like the crazy reactions or anything
like that so like i can really just have him easily on in

1291
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:13,270
the background and i'm like yeah this is this is nice

1292
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,310
Oh my gosh!

1293
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:23,010
I'd like to comment on his stuff to be like, put him in the
algorithm.

1294
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,070
Just like hope that he gets more viewers.

1295
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,670
Because his playthroughs are always so fun.

1296
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,910
Yeah.

1297
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,310
Not with this account though.

1298
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:37,810
I have like a, I have a account.

1299
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:42,450
Like a YouTube account that I have just for watching like
horror videos.

1300
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:45,810
Because the thumbnails sometimes can be scary.

1301
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:48,070
And if they pop up in my regular algorithm.

1302
01:19:48,550 --> 01:20:07,230
scared so I so I have the secret account just for for my
spooky games is it okay if I only watch you when lilac isn't

1303
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:14,410
streaming why would you admit something like that though
that hurts my feelings I'm just kidding I'm just getting I'm

you're, you know, you can be like, I'm not super into this

1312
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:18,550
thing.

1313
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:19,770
You don't have to get it.

1314
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:20,150
It's okay.

1315
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:21,250
It's totally okay.

1316
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:24,030
Yeah.

1317
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:25,830
So.

1318
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:29,490
Don't tell me what to do.

1319
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,170
I'm sick of being phantom.

1320
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:35,230
I'm going to watch me into phantom.

1321
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,490
Saying that just makes me want to super tell you more.

1322
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,230
No, I'm mean at all.

1323
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:43,410
Loyalty to the end.

1324
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:44,190
And Draygos, thank you.

1325
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:47,790
Oh, Andrea goes, you sent some gifted before the stream
started.

1326
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:48,710
Thank you so much.

1327
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:50,010
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1328
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,970
But, yeah, I don't know.

1329
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,630
I just want you guys to take care of yourselves.

1330
01:21:56,930 --> 01:22:03,150
And I would feel more sad if you felt like you were being
burnt out from watching me.

1331
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:08,810
You know, I would feel so sad if it was just like, ah, I
just, I just can't keep up.

1332
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,270
You know, like, that's okay.

1333
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:10,830
That's okay.

1334
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:15,190
I repeat the same stories all the time.

1335
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:16,870
Don't worry about it.

1336
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:21,670
Don't worry about it.

1337
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:23,550
Even if you're like, I'm not into this game.

1338
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:23,990
That's okay.

1339
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:27,230
I won't catch this stream because I'm not into this game.

1340
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:27,630
That's okay.

1341
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:28,450
That's all right.

1342
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:32,970
Signed up to get Corgi Puppy in March.

1343
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:34,510
Waiting for them to be bored.

1344
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:35,750
Any name suggestions?

1345
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,990
Also, definitely be financially responsible.

1346
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,430
Yes.

1347
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,510
Name suggestions Minto

1348
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,680
Minto Minto?

1349
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:51,680
Minto?

1350
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,600
What are we doing here?

1351
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:56,540
Sorry, I got lost chat.

1352
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,820
There's a farm marked on the map.

1353
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,000
Wonder where they grow there.

1354
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,160
We are at the farm.

1355
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:01,840
No?

1356
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,000
That's what I clicked on.

1357
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,640
Oh my gosh, I keep clicking the wrong thing.

1358
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,180
I didn't click the wrong thing here, though.

1359
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,420
This is the farm.

1360
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,120
Oh, maybe I can get to the farm from here.

1361
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,240
Maybe it's like a...

1362
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,840
According to the map, Ivy Farm is across the road there.

1363
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:15,600
Okay, okay, okay.

1364
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,360
But then my Oshi will possibly say my name.

1365
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:22,040
I just got paid so I can't send...

1366
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:22,780
So I...

1367
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,000
Wait.

1368
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,740
I just got paid so I can't send a few supers.

1369
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:26,460
That's okay.

1370
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,040
Wait.

1371
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,080
You can't?

1372
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:28,700
That's okay.

1373
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,100
Oh my gosh!

1374
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,820
I just wanted to comment, but now...

1375
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,120
Thank you so much for the...

1376
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,180
Guys, I hope all.

1377
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:49,080
I think it's the feeling of aging out or feeling stuck in
life.

1378
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:52,820
A lot of otakus who turn 40 don't want to be the old, creepy
guy surrounded by younger fans.

1379
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,260
It's okay why I wish I was married and had a kid to enjoy
stuff with.

1380
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,920
I'm only in my late 20s.

1381
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,200
Also, GF.

1382
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:00,500
wife jealousy.

1383
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,760
You think so?

1384
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:02,940
Hmm.

1385
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:05,240
Maybe.

1386
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,660
I think, though, I would like to be somebody that could be
enjoyed by anybody, you know.

1387
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,280
Also, hobbies.

1388
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:20,100
And your interests, you know, hobbies don't have an age
limit.

1389
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:25,760
So don't ever feel like, like if you grow out of, if you
lose interest in something, that's one thing.

1390
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:37,400
But if you enjoy a hobby, don't deprive yourself of your
enjoyment because you think that it will be looked down

1391
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:37,780
upon.

1392
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,540
You know what I mean?

1393
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,340
Just enjoy what you like.

1394
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:45,620
They'll be so much happier that way.

1395
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:54,700
why would you why would you want to be unhappy because of
the judgment of other people just enjoy what you like and

1396
01:24:54,700 --> 01:25:03,440
and then if you enjoy what you like and other people follow
suit as well you can find other people that are in your you

1397
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:10,100
know same age range that also stuck around so don't worry
about it.

1398
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,730
Oh my gosh, Mel, thank you!

1399
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:21,470

She saw Kate in the pub last Friday, around 7, I think.

1420
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:07,130
So she came in drunk, gave us some money for a breakage or
something, then left.

1421
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:11,470

Picture frames with black painted glass.

1458
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,430
Routine.

You know Simon, don't you?

1461
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:18,410
Thompson.

1462
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:20,210
Why, what did he say?

1463
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:23,550
That you all went to college together, you and Kate.

1464
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:24,290
Is that right?

1465
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:24,730
Wait, what?

1466
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:25,730
Might have done.

1467
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:27,230
Right.

1468
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,010
Good enough.

1469
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,550
It's a hobbit hole.

1470
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:33,670
Okay.

1471
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:36,510
Let's start at the very beginning.

1472
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:37,970
James.

1473
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,250
I don't remember James.

1474
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:43,350
When was the last time you saw Kate Vine?

1475
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:44,690
Can't remember.

1476
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,070
How did you know her?

1477
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:48,810
Through Simon, his girlfriend was mates with her.

1478
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,590
Saw around college a few times.

1479
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:52,630
Did you socialize with her much?

1480
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:53,090
Nah.

1481
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,110
She wasn't my type.

1482
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:56,290
Okay.

1483
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:58,410
Why is he kind of creeping me out?

1484
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:01,150
James, you're kind of scary.

1485
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:02,410
Why are you kind of...

1486
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,910
She wasn't my type.

1487
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:08,570
Did you know whether Kate had lost this or not?

1488
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,050
No idea.

1489
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:15,550
Doesn't know if Kate had lost the license.

1490
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:19,290
Uh...

1491
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:22,890
Are you gonna go steal the bicycle?

1492
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:25,190
Do you want to do a crime together?

1493
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,710
What do you know about Simon's bike?

1494
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:29,430
Stream time is weightlifting time.

1495
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,810
Let's go.

1496
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:30,530
You haven't seen him on a bike?

1497
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:31,870
I haven't seen him.

1498
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,850
When was the last time you saw him?

1499
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:36,210
About a month ago.

1500
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:39,490
Why is he so suspicious?

1501
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:42,350
He's not creepy, just a hobbit otaku.

1502
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:50,410
Uh, uh, the homebrew.

1503
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:54,370
Does, do you know about the, have you seen the screwdriver?

1504
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:57,770
Have you, uh, ever tried Simon's homebrew?

1505
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:00,590
Thompson's tar, yeah, I've tried it.

1506
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,770
Thompson's tar.

1507
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:03,750
To me, not for money anyway.

1508
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:05,730
We used to trade stuff.

1509
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:08,070
Oh wait, is this the guy he traded the herbs with?

1510
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:09,290
Make a nice herbal tea, is it?

1511
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:09,750

He likes girls!

1525
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,730
Scrying goes back centuries.

1526
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:28,690
The ancient Persians did it.

1527
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:31,430
This country pagans still practice it.

1528
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:33,170
The fortune tellers pretend to do it.

1529
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:34,730
That's what the crystal ball's all about.

1530
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:35,490
And the druids?

1531
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:36,030
It's all scrying.

1532
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:40,990
But what is scrying?

1533
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:42,970
Depends who you are.

1534
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:44,850
People do it for different reasons.

1535
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:54,870
what sort of reasons that didn't answer anything what is
scrying I don't know people do it yeah that's me is that

1536
01:32:54,870 --> 01:33:02,010
what you use them for James communicating with the dead how
they make them for other people these days and there's a

1537
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:09,430
market for these is there lots of people want to talk to the
dead even if they don't believe in it I'm scrying I'm

1538
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:16,310
scrying you guys are scrying I'm very charitable of you can

1539
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:18,710

1540
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:20,910
Mirrors and hookah pipes.

1541
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:21,770
Hookah pipes.

1542
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,150
I wonder what else James is into.

1543
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:24,950
Interesting.

1544
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:33,750
I like how the scrying mirrors are just like spray painted
frames in the backyard.

1545
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:37,590
I'm shaking and scrying.

1546
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,610
You guys are scrying right now?

1547
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:48,010
Usually I communicate through a spirit box, but Maybe I
should try, I've never tried a scrying mirror before.

1548
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:49,390
That's so exciting.

1549
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:55,450
Excited for the Mint Phantom Black Mirror merch where she
talks to you?

1550
01:33:55,710 --> 01:34:01,430
It'll be like one of those like Halloween ones where you
press a button and my reflection shows up or something.

1551
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:08,880
Wait.

1552
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,040
Wait, that's kind of a good idea actually.

1553
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:15,800
Memo.

1556
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:45,920
wanted to ask if it's possible ever and he was like he was
like always ask even if it's he's so tsundere he says that

1557
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,400
he's gonna quit Or that he's gonna like...

1558
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,300
That he's gonna...

1559
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,040
He wants to be fired, he wants to like quit.

1560
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,260
But then...

1561
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:02,660
But then when I say like, oh I have a stupid merch idea,
he's just like, oh yeah, tell me anytime you have an idea,

1562
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,160
no matter how dumb, we'll always try to do it for you guys.

1563
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:07,920
So tsundere!

1564
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,420
We're seeing a cute ghost in the lower left of our scrying
mirrors right now.

1565
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,660
Actually, yeah, yeah.

1566
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,260
In the stream, straight up scrying it.

1567
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,980
Cendere of Denzetsu.

1568
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:27,740
For real!

1569
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,100
Phoebe was like trying to do something the other day.

1570
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,700
And he was just like, I'm going to quit.

1571
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,680
I'm going to quit.

1572
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,080
He's so cendere.

1573
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,140
Thank you.

1574
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:39,740
Oh, wait.

1575
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:41,420
Did I have anything else?

1576
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,280
No, I think that was it.

1577
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,220
So dramatic.

1578
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:47,020
So dramatic.

1579
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,420
All right.

1580
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,220
Let's see.

1581
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:55,620
Now we have this very exciting mirror to show off to
everybody.

1582
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:57,880
Do you scry?

1583
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,250
Do you scry at night?

1584
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,460
Otaku's favorite anime is Eskri!

1585
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,520
I haven't...

1586
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,080
I...

1587
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:18,120
I have not thought of that show in...

1588
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,020
Give me more questions, please.

1589
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:20,980
In...

1590
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,180
Million years.

1591
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:25,360
Oh, yeah.

1592
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:26,020
Okay, bro.

1593
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:28,520
Have you seen one of these before?

1594
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,440
Is it meant to be black like that?

1595
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,620
I think so.

1596
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:32,700
No.

1597
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,920
Has never seen the Black Mirror TV show on Netflix before.

1598
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,800
Never finished it?

1599
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:43,220
Me neither.

1600
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,020
I don't think I finished it either.

1601
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,140
I don't even remember what it's about.

1602
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,820
You go to actually when they scry.

1603

Okay, so you just...

1614
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:03,290
You just stare like this.

1615
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:06,390
And...

1616
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:07,410
Oh, my gosh, you're going to see Kate?

1617
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,510
Then you see...

1618
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:10,850
Kate.

1619
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:15,980
See what?

1620
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:17,380
Sorry.

1621
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:18,920
Um...

1622
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,060
Look, you're meant to see a ghost or something.

1623
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:30,760
look it doesn't work wait is this getting kind of spooky
says

1624
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:50,000
the mirror doesn't work I see I see I see be back later on
if that's okay very yeah she was oddly into it right huh huh

1625
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,580
ever seen one of these audio in this room in particular is
terrible.

1626
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,880
He's into a dead of night.

1627
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,320
Same team.

1628
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:01,080
Mysticism, magic spells, that sort of thing.

1629
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:02,960
He's nuts though.

1630
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,700
I mean, he thinks the government are tracking him or
something.

1631
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:07,420
Why would he think that?

1632
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,240
I don't know.

1633
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,240
You'd have to ask him.

1634
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:14,460
They're seeing him through the mirror, the scrying mirror.

1635
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:16,660
Oh no!

1636
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,180
James thinks the government is tracking him.

1637
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:25,550
They're tracking him through the scrying mirror.

1638
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,270
I'll probably be back later.

1639
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:29,590
Let's go try Atlas again.

1640
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:34,110
There we go.

1641
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:36,890
They're scrying on him.

1642
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:44,190
Yeah, they're scrying on him.

1643
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:45,990
It's random.

1644
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:46,490
Oh.

1645
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:49,710
Oh, I thought this was a new...

1646
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:50,710
Anybody in here?

1647
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:52,690
Anybody reading in the reading room?

1648
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:55,470
Shut.

1649
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,790
Nobody's reading in the reading room.

1650
01:39:58,510 --> 01:39:59,670
Anybody scrying in the reading room?

1651
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:17,650
room anybody crying in the reading room let me in okay dang
let's try this building where we found the let's try the

1652
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:33,750
this one the mirror shows your browser history whoa no oh no
hmm I feel like we need that we have a probably a call

1653
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,910
There's a contradiction somewhere.

1654
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:39,750
What did we talk with the chief about?

1655
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:40,530
I don't remember.

1656
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:46,430
Behind the house.

1657
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:48,070
Yeah, let's see if there's anything here now.

1658
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:50,230
Oh, the window!

1659
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:50,710
That's right!

1660
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:51,170
That's right.

1661
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:51,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1662
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:57,070
So let's go back to Rebecca and push her a little bit more
about the window.

1663
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:03,050
Show her the mirror?

1664
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:03,430
We did!

1665
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:03,770
We did!

1666
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:06,470
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

1667
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:07,390
Yeah, okay.

1668
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:10,330
So let's go through.

1669
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:13,350
Let's see, has never seen the black mirror before?

1670
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,290
Suggest talking to Ryan about the mask.

1671
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,100
Doesn't know who broke the window.

1672
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:28,340
Heard an argument between two girls outside.

1673
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:35,530
Rebecca doesn't know who was arguing or who broke the window
outside last Friday.

1674
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:39,070
I wonder if it's connected with this breakage.

1675
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:40,270
Ah!

1676
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:42,350
I got it, first try!

1677
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:48,010
So, you said Kate gave you £20 for a breakage, but you
didn't have a breakage.

1678
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:49,590
That's right.

1679
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:53,450
Do you think the payment could have been for the broken
window?

1680
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:56,130
Could it have been Kate who was arguing?

1681
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:59,930
Well, I suppose it could have been.

1682
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:00,610
Yeah.

1683
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:02,110
It could have been Kate.

1684
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:03,110
You're probably right, yeah.

1685
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,270
But you don't know who she was arguing with?

1686
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,850
No, I'm not sure.

1687
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:08,390
I'll ask around.

1688
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:11,170
I'll ask around.

1689
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:12,930
the window.

1690
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:17,470
Rebecca really should have worked that out before now,
unless she did.

1691
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:19,410
But why would she lie about that?

1692
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:23,970
Rebecca told Jenks about the argument in the pub last
Friday.

1693
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:26,930
Oh, Kate's argument, okay.

1694
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:27,970
Yeah.

1695
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:30,110
Huh.

1696
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:32,390
I know.

1697
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:33,230
Thank you.

1698
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:36,830
No, the insult here is the 20 pounds for the broken window.

1699
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:37,990
Like, that's crazy.

1700
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:40,750
All right, let's go talk to Emma.

1701
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:43,930
Emma, I'm climbing through your window.

1702
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:49,610
Actually, I'm gonna break her window and be like, Ever seen
one of these?

1703
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:52,110
Does this remind you of anything?

1704
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:53,690
More questions if you don't mind.

1705
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:58,310
Did you hear about an argument in the pub last Friday?

1706
01:42:58,690 --> 01:42:59,410
No, I wasn't there.

1707
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:00,410
You weren't in the village?

1708
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:04,970
No, I went home last Thursday night, actually, to see my
parents.

1709
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:06,730
But you do visit the pub.

1710
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:09,650
Oh, yeah, I mean, I know Rebecca quite well.

1711
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:11,770
We all went there.

1712
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:14,390
Quite a bit after college.

1713
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:17,590
Uh-huh.

1714
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:20,110
Went home to see... Wait.

1715
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:24,610
Uh...

1716
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,060
Suss.

1717
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:33,500
Yeah, objection?

1718
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:34,860
Objection?

1719
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,720
I'm just trying to see where.

1720
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,820
Uh, hold on.

1721
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:43,280
Okay.

1722
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:54,870
She went home to her parents on Thursday.

1723
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:57,190
Maybe?

1724
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:07,330
Wasn't she at the market on Friday?

1725
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:08,850
Oh, did she say that?

1726
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:09,470
Wait.

1727
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:11,070
Ah!

1728
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:13,690
Dun, dun, dun!

1729
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:15,430
You're right.

1730

1747
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:06,350
Oh my gosh, this is the hardest part, is finding where the
prompts are.

1748
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:12,860
Uh...

1749
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:14,920
Uh...

1750
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:18,240
Where would it be under?

1751
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:25,740
It's not under broken pub window.

1752
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:28,640
Um...

1753
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:33,250
I'm just clicking on anything now.

1754
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:34,650
Ha!

1755
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:35,830
I don't know.

1756
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:36,370
Wait.

1757
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:43,800
Hmm.

1758
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,780
She knew nothing about the 20.

1759
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,860
Well, that's, I guess it's true, right?

1760
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,840
Sure, your attorney's pin.

1761
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:56,060
Wait, wrong game.

1762
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,960
It did, yeah, she did buy a lot of jewelry.

1763
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:05,300
So, let's see if it's that.

1764
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,240
Oh, good job, guys.

1765
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:14,840
So you lent money to Kate because she was desperate but she
bought loads of jewelry and things so why were you lending

1766
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:27,520
her money well no it's because um because I'm what spit it
out it was it wasn't about money was it Emma no go on what

1767
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:34,680
was it really about we were arguing because she was going to
blackmail Ryan the guy from Atlas over an affair was having

1768
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:43,340
and then tell his wife if he didn't give her the money
Ryan's affair with Kate no I don't know I think he was

1769
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:48,320
having an affair with another student and Kate found out and
why were you involved because I didn't really agree with it

1770
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:54,960
I didn't agree with what she was doing even if he did have
an affair were you friends with Ryan no I'd never met him

1771
01:47:54,960 --> 01:48:05,820
you just thought Kate was wrong uh-huh I don't know not sure
about this Emma's either on a moral crusade or there's

1772
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:20,480
another reason she was worried Ryan right um that doesn't
really has never met Ryan but she knows uh but she said

1773
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:33,740
she's good friends with um uh she said she said she's good
friends with Rebecca hold on uh where was that under wait

1774
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:45,780
had been to a similar oh no similar course just kidding um
wait no she went to Alice with Simon yeah you liar you said

1775
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:53,380
you went to an Atlas meeting with Simon yes that's
interesting because I happen to know that Ryan is the main

1776
01:48:53,380 --> 01:49:04,520
lecturer at Atlas you say you never met him this face you
say you don't know him okay I need I need to tell you

1777
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:11,260
something I just need to make sure Simon doesn't find she
had an affair she's the she's the mistress and you can't

1778
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:22,740
tell rebecca either oh okay so the affair what happened was
was between ryan and i oh my god i was having the affair and

1779
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:30,680
kate knew so kate was blackmailing both of you no she didn't
care about me it was part of the course you see having to

1780
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:35,600
take all these risks she thought it was funny to turn her
back on ryan she thought i

1781
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:47,640
yes i was already with simon when ryan and i you know and i
didn't want simon finding out and kate thought simon's ear

1782
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:54,620
to the wall is the other room and then if rebecca found out
then simon would definitely have found out and then it would

1783
01:49:54,620 --> 01:50:01,400
have blown up and it would have just been a big mess so you
just argued and well you got yourself into the mess little

1784
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:05,380
missy well she just stormed off from a burglar window.

1785
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:06,440
And that was it.

1786
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,140
You didn't see her again that night?

1787
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,000
No.

1788
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,140
Are you sure?

1789
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,140
Yes.

1790
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:15,080
I promise.

1791
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,260
You like her hair?

1792
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:17,900
It's very anime, isn't it?

1793
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:18,480
Oh!

1794
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,300
7pm!

1795
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,380
Oh my gosh!

1796
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,000
You just feel like the chapters.

1797
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,860
So, Ryan's a bit of Lothario, is he?

1798
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:26,500
What the Lothario?

1799
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:29,400
I met this Ryan Rand face to face.

1800
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:30,100
Yeah.

1801
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:33,340
Interesting.

1802
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:35,580
Oh, it's getting good.

1803
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,220
It's getting juicy.

1804
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:36,680
Oh, whoops.

1805
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:37,900
This is the back of the pub, my bad.

1806
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,280
I thought this was the back of the house.

1807
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:44,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1808
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,240

Yes.

1812
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:00,570
I wonder if he's here or if he's at Atlas.

1813
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,270
We'll go see.

1814
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:04,490

1821
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:25,240
Ryan!

1822
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,400
Oh my god!

1823
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:30,360
Detective Inspector Jenks, I'm conducting an investigation
in the area.

1824
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:32,120
When am I asking you a few questions?

1825
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:32,580
Is that alright?

1826
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,460
Come in, Inspector.

1827
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:36,520
Thank you.

1828
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:47,780
you can't okay i'm sorry but like if you are in a town with
five people you can't go cheating i mean cheating is bad

1829
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:55,860
already but like you can't go cheating and then expect
nobody to find out there's five people in town i believe

1830
01:51:55,860 --> 01:52:07,800
that uh kate vine was a student at atlas kate vine well yes
she was all of this has been thoroughly investigated

1831
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:17,100
inspector it was suicide well we have reason to believe
there may be rather more to it than that really oh then in

1832
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:23,680
that case i'd be prepared to assist in any way possible
thank you pleasure

1833
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:38,990
why is everyone in this town suspicious looking i know all
right let's start at the very beginning i believe the last

1834
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:45,930
time you saw Kate Vine was at the pub last Friday then you
came straight back with some of the students is that right

1835
01:52:45,930 --> 01:52:53,030
yes I like to have a glass of port or two after a long day
and benefits of being married to the landlady how did she

1836
01:52:53,030 --> 01:53:05,630
seem that night the landlady Kate okay why is she saying it
like that yes I mean it didn't impair her ability though she

1837
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:13,790
was a very bright star lots of potential very seem to be
enjoying the course as far as anybody could tell yes when

1838
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:22,610
did you first meet her uh when she joined about three months
ago and you hadn't met her before then no so you didn't

1839
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:30,570
suspect there was anything wrong well do you mean did i
expect her to drown herself of course i didn't inspect her

1840
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:41,910
it was quite a shock nobody expected that uh-huh okay last
arcaded atlas meeting last Friday Kate was drunk first met

1841
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:47,530
Kate three months ago at Atlas said Kate enjoyed the course
and appeared happy hadn't suspected she had any emotional

1842
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:59,970
problems okay but we know she was a bit explosive before not
that I recall you don't know whether Kate had lost this or

1843
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:09,010
not no I've never seen it before sorry I'm getting real
defensive mister why so angry why are you so upset about it

1844
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:15,970
huh yeah i've never seen it before i don't know i don't know
i don't know what you're talking about uh why are we asking

1845
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:23,370
about the bicycle again does simon thompson ride a bike do
you know i think so yes i think i think he drives as well

1846
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:31,990
but i might be mistaken simon doesn't ride a or does ride a
bike thinks simon also drives but isn't sure why why is this

1847
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:39,330
relative like relative i don't get it whatever that's fine
do you know anything about a screwdriver I've seen it.

1848
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:47,290
And if you were to identify it, would you report it back to
the original owner that you saw it in my pocket?

1849
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:50,750
The village bicycle.

1850
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:54,270
Have you tried Simon's homebrew?

1851
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:55,630
Does he make homebrew?

1852
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:57,150
No, I haven't had the pleasure.

1853
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:02,190
Okay, hasn't tried Simon's homebrew.

1854
01:55:05,070 --> 01:55:06,190
Broken pendant.

1855
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:07,250
Yeah, the freedom.

1856
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:08,290
No, this is.

1857
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:09,810
Yes.

1858
01:55:10,090 --> 01:55:12,650
The music's so dramatic, but Jenks is so silly.

1859
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:14,190
It's a symbol that we use on the course.

1860
01:55:14,830 --> 01:55:18,310
It's supposed to represent freedom from the chains of your
ancestry.

1861
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:20,670
Have you ever bought one of these?

1862
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:23,030
I haven't, but I've seen the students wearing them.

1863
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:34,120
What if he bought the necklace for Emma?

1864
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,320
Have we interviewed the bike yet?

1865
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,720
Here it gets around.

1866
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:58,130
some things right if he if it's used on the course why
wouldn't he have bought it before you know hmm curious very

1867
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:06,830
very curious what do you know about the broken window at the
back of the pub no Rebecca told me about it I don't know how

1868
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:13,670
it got smashed though I told her to tape over it we can't
have anybody cutting themselves you have to be very health

1869
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:28,170
safety conscious these days health and safety conscious
health and safety conscious what the heck oh it's taught

1870
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:36,230
wait no I want to save the mask for last because it's so
interesting about this ah it's uh it's first one we ever

1871
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:42,010
have made we had it designed by an agency after we'd spent
weeks trying to trying to find a name this place.

1872
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:43,090
It took you weeks.

1873
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,650
Don't be like that, Inspector.

1874
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:46,690
I thought it was a rather grand name.

1875
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:53,170
Actually, if I'm being honest, I plucked it out of thin air
one night in the George while I was having a few gin and

1876
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:53,410
tonics.

1877
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:56,390
Well, actually, somebody left a book and I stole it.

1878
01:57:00,490 --> 01:57:03,390
This guy is so...

1879
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:08,390
He basically just te he peddled at us.

1880
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:13,170
Oh my god!

1881
01:57:16,150 --> 01:57:18,270
He's so cheeky!

1882
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:23,230
Oh my gosh, have you ever tried a scrying mirror?

1883
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:25,450
Have you seen one of these before?

1884
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:34,850
believe that looks like a scrying mirror to me I have seen
one before hmm well I used to have one myself actually along

1885
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:43,410
with lots of other bits and pieces of that nature silly
things you know really yes when I was in my teenage years I

1886
01:57:43,410 --> 01:57:49,750
had quite an obsession with that kind of thing I was a very
somber child and not that you could tell always playing

1887
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:59,150
fantasy games reading books about that kind of malarkey you
know malarkey what sort of books did you read well books on

1888
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:09,070
black magic not the chocolates satanic rituals that kind of
thing I grew out of it of course but you're not into that

1889
01:58:09,070 --> 01:58:17,110
sort of thing now of course I'm not I mean I don't need to
believe in the supernatural inspector the natural world is

1890
01:58:17,110 --> 01:58:27,110
far more interesting don't you think so oh and I don't don't
I don't believe this guy at all this guy is definitely doing

1891
01:58:27,110 --> 01:58:38,810
this guy is definitely doing crazy rituals I used to be an
otaku type situation I don't believe you one bit I don't

1892
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:46,850
believe you one bit do you know anything about an argument
in the pub last Friday what time I believe it wasn't long

1893
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:55,210
after the opened no I usually leave for the manor house
about six games too scary is it because it's British I like

1894
01:58:55,210 --> 01:59:04,690
to get a head start doesn't know about the argument usually
leaves Rylas at six starts preparations Rylas 630 okay all

1895
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:13,670
right time for the mask I'm so excited can you tell me about
this haven't seen that for a while we had a friend who used

1896
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:22,130
to make them for us for the course he passed away last year
what does the symbol mean yeah it's borrowed from paganism

1897
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:32,090
it's the symbol of the triple goddess the mother maiden and
crone represented by the waxing and waning of the moon it's

1898
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:39,890
an ancient symbol it predates Christianity some people say
that it dates back to Paleolithic times and is that relevant

1899
01:59:39,890 --> 01:59:47,130
to the course well no no no I mean it's a symbol we we've
dabbled with but it's it on the course, no.

1900
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:50,750
I see.

1901
01:59:52,170 --> 01:59:55,990
The symbol is not used on the course.

1902
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:58,270
Okay, time to look at everything, you guys.

1903
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:00,830
Is this a symbol?

1904
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:05,750
Atlas name picked randomly.

1905
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:08,090
I thought he said he stole it.

1906
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:16,490
But the mask is from the course.

1907
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:21,090
This almost looks like the symbol.

1908
02:00:21,470 --> 02:00:23,470
Actually looks more like an eyeball, but whatever.

1909
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:25,470
The triple goddesses.

1910
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:28,350
Minto Phoebe and Victoria.

1911
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:33,970
Praise the son!

1912
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:36,390
I'm in a cult!

1913
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,370
Blonde guy said it was part of the course.

1914
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:44,470
The symbols or...

1915
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:52,180
But he said the mask is used for the course, but not...

1916
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:57,000
The symbol specifically, I don't think Simon brought up.

1917
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,780
I feel like there's a contradiction, but I just don't know
where.

1918
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,560
Used to have a black mirror himself.

1919
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:06,000
Used to read about black magic and satanic rituals.

1920
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:08,100
Doesn't believe in anything supernatural now.

1921
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:11,240
Then why have the symbol?

1922
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:16,560
Let's try it.

1923
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:25,900
Nope.

1924
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:29,780
If he left at 6.30, wouldn't he see the argument outright?

1925
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:31,860
What?

1926
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:38,690
Uh, but I don't think we have that.

1927
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:40,450
Oh, wait, wait.

1928
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:41,970
Uh.

1929
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:46,680
Oh, it doesn't know how it got broken.

1930
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,080
Yeah.

1931
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:49,220
Wait, no.

1932
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:51,140
Oh, well, it was our...

1933
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:51,660
Let's see.

1934
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:58,920
No, because if he starts preparations, I think they said
630, didn't they?

1935
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:02,080
He didn't leave at 630.

1936
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,040
He starts prepping at 630.

1937
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:13,380
I feel like we have something, but I'm not quite sure.

1938
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:19,100
Said he never bought a freedom necklace.

1939
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:30,280
And some of these are like green.

1940
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,180
Have you noticed that?

1941
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:32,680
I wonder why.

1942
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:37,330
Hmm.

1943
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:41,190
Maybe that's like a hint or something.

1944
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:50,180
I think those are usable items.

1945
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:54,240
I don't think so.

1946
02:02:56,460 --> 02:03:05,500
green means objects oh okay so these are my notes this is an
object okay okay okay I get it okay yeah yeah yeah okay that

1947
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:06,040
makes sense

1948
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:22,620
hinto for minto no just trying to figure it out just going
through everything it was a lot of information so I'm

1949
02:03:22,620 --> 02:03:27,260
sussing out the bird in the cage thing, the necklace.

1950
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:32,960
Simon writes his book.

1951
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,100
I can't...

1952
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:37,680
Hmm.

1953
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,280
When all else fails, click randomly.

1954
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:42,700
I don't think that works here.

1955
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:51,160
I want to press more about the friend who died last year.

1956
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:52,620
What is that about?

1957
02:03:58,060 --> 02:04:00,540
Was it something about Kate being there on Friday?

1958
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:10,650
Uh, I don't think we have that in here or

1959
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:23,140
Kate was drunk at the meeting I will let me try this it says
that she was drunk at the meeting but doesn't know about the

1960
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:33,560
argument at the pub seems kind of no okay never mind because
it's just like oh she got drunk at the pub so you don't know

1961
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:37,980
that she was arguing you know hmm hmm

1962
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:47,490
first met Kate three months ago at Atlas but

1963
02:04:50,870 --> 02:05:02,030
saw students wearing the necklace the only necklace we've
seen that wearing it is Emma right but if he hold on no

1964
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:07,070
we'll come back we'll come back thank you probably be back
later

1965
02:05:15,650 --> 02:05:17,290
I'm suspecting the bicycle.

1966
02:05:18,430 --> 02:05:18,470
Same?

1967
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:20,270
Okay, I'm looking at the clue.

1968
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:21,390
What the?

1969
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:23,170
What's the exclamation point for?

1970
02:05:24,670 --> 02:05:25,870
Better see Simon again.

1971
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:28,190
You also have some things you haven't asked Simon and James
about yet.

1972
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:29,570
What was that?

1973
02:05:29,650 --> 02:05:30,330
What did he give us?

1974
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:31,830
What did we not ask?

1975
02:05:33,010 --> 02:05:33,850
The argument?

1976
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:34,470
Maybe?

1977
02:05:37,810 --> 02:05:39,090
Go talk to Simon.

1978
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:45,640
I think the bike is our culprit.

1979
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:46,880
Yeah, we should arrest the bike.

1980
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,520
There you go.

1981
02:05:49,580 --> 02:05:50,140
Come on.

1982
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:51,200
Thank you.

1983
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:56,120
He got a cute little apron on.

1984
02:05:56,380 --> 02:05:56,960
Smells nice.

1985
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:57,580
What is that?

1986
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,780
Chili pork.

1987
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:01,560
Oh, that sounds so yummy.

1988
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:03,680
Used to be more into it.

1989
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:05,060
No, I don't do it so much.

1990
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,960
Used to grow my own herbs and everything.

1991
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:07,480
Not here.

1992
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:08,980
No.

1993
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:10,960
At the farmhouse where I used to live.

1994
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:11,680
Where was that?

1995
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:13,560
That's where James lives.

1996
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:15,240
Yeah, we used to share our house together.

1997
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,180
The farmer used to let us use it.

1998
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:30,160
a corner of his greenhouse to grow stuff interesting james
that well well didn't really get on yeah well it's just

1999
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:40,800
through the farm yard at the back interesting uh-huh so the
argument what we did ask about yeah james is into new age

2000
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:49,380
mysticism know anything about an argument at the pub that's
right No, I didn't go to the pub last Friday.

2001
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:51,120
What did you do after the course?

2002
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:52,840
Just went home.

2003
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:53,680
Came here.

2004
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:55,480
Just came straight back.

2005
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:56,700
Why is it?

2006
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:58,980
Oh, not his eyes darting.

2007
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:01,200
Why is everybody lying to us?

2008
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:08,720
I don't, I didn't do anything last Friday.

2009
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:09,520
I came straight home.

2010
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:11,780
I swear.

2011
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:14,200
I honestly, I never saw Kate.

2012
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:15,480
I never saw anybody.

2013
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,580
I just, I didn't go to the pub or anything.

2014
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:22,240
Wait, wait, isn't there that one game?

2015
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:26,460
Like, what a game is it?

2016
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:30,460
It's like another detective game, and they're like, I don't
know anything about it.

2017
02:07:30,820 --> 02:07:33,080
I, like, you, LA, don't worry.

2018
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:39,320
You like, they're just like, I don't know anything about it,
officer.

2019
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:40,860
Quit asking me.

2020
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:48,820
It's so funny.

2021
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:50,320
Minto did it.

2022
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:51,520
Yeah, I did.

2023
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:53,400
What did I do?

2024
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:57,360
It's so...

2025
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:59,560
They'll be so...

2026
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:03,740
They make like this goofy, guilty face afterwards.

2027
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:08,960
I've never heard that name before.

2028
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:12,220
And I never will hear it again in my life.

2029
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:21,150
I'm...

2030
02:08:21,170 --> 02:08:29,770
the when the ghost is sus doesn't know anything about the
argument went straight home okay let's see uh i

2031
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:43,260
saw kate at the atlas meeting last friday so that kind of
checks because he said that he went straight home after

2032
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:59,190
atlas doesn't know anything about the argument claims he
hardly ever visits the pub uh i'm i am going through things

2033
02:08:59,190 --> 02:09:13,750
uh doesn't see james very often he did say that they don't
really get along do happen in the fire screwdriver

2034
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:25,680
okay i'm not seeing anything that like is jumping out at me

2035
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,860
But they shared a greenhouse corner.

2036
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:35,280
They must have a past.

2037
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:37,060
Yes.

2038
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:39,800
Let's go talk to James.

2039
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,060
James will be honest with us.

2040
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:46,220
James will surely know.

2041
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:50,400
Oh, wait.

2042
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,000
I keep going the wrong way, my bad.

2043
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,060
Chief, I'm confused.

2044
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:55,080
Chief, tell me something.

2045
02:09:56,700 --> 02:09:57,560
Talk to me, Chief.

2046
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:06,990
I can't.

2047
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:10,310
I can't tell if this is actually calling or not.

2048
02:10:12,610 --> 02:10:13,410
Okay, whatever.

2049
02:10:14,690 --> 02:10:15,390
Abbey Farm.

2050
02:10:15,810 --> 02:10:16,270
Abbey Farm.

2051
02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:19,930
Hello.

2052
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:21,770
Ringlinglingling.

2053
02:10:22,110 --> 02:10:22,510
Ringlingling.

2054
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:23,410
Look at this.

2055
02:10:23,490 --> 02:10:24,710
Oh, did you guys see the spider?

2056
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:26,190
A couple more questions if that's okay.

2057
02:10:26,330 --> 02:10:27,670
I forgot to show you guys again.

2058
02:10:29,370 --> 02:10:30,090
Kate's argument.

2059
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:30,710
Do you know anything?

2060
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:33,510
No, anything about an argument at the pub last Friday.

2061
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:34,810
No.

2062
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:36,990
Okay.

2063
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:40,650
No.

2064
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:50,660
We came all the way across town for that.

2065
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:53,300
No.

2066
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:55,420
Okay, bye.

2067
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:56,940
Be that later on, if that's okay.

2068
02:11:02,110 --> 02:11:02,910
What's my hint?

2069
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:07,250
Did Simon say there was another greenhouse at Abbey Farm?

2070
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:09,290
Did it?

2071
02:11:09,610 --> 02:11:10,830
Actually, I don't remember that at all.

2072
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:12,410
Wait, can we go up?

2073
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:16,090
Check it out.

2074
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:18,670
Simon mentioned another greenhouse on the farm.

2075
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:19,030
Oh.

2076
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:21,890
Okay, I missed that.

2077
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:23,290
Missed that point.

2078
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:24,450
Oh my gosh, I need to pay attention.

2079
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:25,530
I need to lock in.

2080
02:11:25,790 --> 02:11:29,490
I need to be, I need to be, I need to be jerking it around.

2081
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:32,530
Is this, I'm, look at this little onsen.

2082
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:33,010
Wow.

2083
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:35,210
Okay, large greenhouse.

2084
02:11:35,910 --> 02:11:37,030
What we got going on in here?

2085
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:40,610
Yeah, because we're detective jerkins.

2086
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:42,930
Okay.

2087
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:45,090
Is that a weed?

2088
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:47,390
Is it?

2089
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:48,230
Actually, I don't know.

2090
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:49,290
I don't know.

2091
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:53,250
I wonder if James knows this is here.

2092
02:11:53,290 --> 02:11:54,410
M.M.

2093
02:11:54,450 --> 02:11:57,170
It would be interesting to see what he says about it.

2094
02:11:59,150 --> 02:12:01,450
For marijuana marijuana?

2095
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:04,390
Oh my god.

2096
02:12:05,010 --> 02:12:06,570
Packet of dried leaves.

2097
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:08,690
M.M.

2098
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:11,510
Flip it around.

2099
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:20,260
Wicked Witch!

2100
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,120
M-M.

2101
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:25,850
M-M.

2102
02:12:26,410 --> 02:12:29,350
Try using this!

2103
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:31,170
I'm using the leaves.

2104
02:12:31,750 --> 02:12:35,410
A packet of suspicious looking leaves was found in the
greenhouse at the farm.

2105
02:12:36,690 --> 02:12:37,310
M-M.

2106
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:39,050
Turn it around.

2107
02:12:39,550 --> 02:12:39,990
Flip it around.

2108
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:41,830
Wicked Witch!

2109
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:47,050
Why are you like this?

2110
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:48,750

02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:21,840
You did say you traded the herbal teas for...

2122
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,460
Told you she did it.

2123
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:25,120
Oh.

2124
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:29,740
Want some cookery competitions.

2125
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:30,520
Wait, hold on.

2126
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:31,500
I've got to rewatch this again.

2127
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,000
Could you tell me what These are, please.

2128
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:35,420
I found them in the greenhouse.

2129
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:38,700
But you're snooping around on the farm, have we?

2130
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:40,520
It's called investigating, James.

2131
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,700
It's just mint.

2132
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:45,100
Mint leaves for cooking.

2133
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:47,220
Yeah, I...

2134
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:49,300
I heard you were a bit of a budding chef.

2135
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:50,200
Dabble a bit.

2136
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:51,780
One of few competitions.

2137
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:53,240
Very impressive.

2138
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:56,820
So you normally just leave packets of mint lying around.

2139
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:58,620
Must have dropped it.

2140
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,960
Must have dropped it.

2141
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:05,020
Where were you last Friday?

2142
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:06,620
Okay, that's it for now.

02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:07,320
Thank you.

2144
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:08,840
Thank you.

2145
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,220
Our little shoulder bag's getting quite heavy, probably.

2146
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:15,960
All right, let's head back to Simon.

2147
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:17,720
Ask him about this.

2148
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,380
This mint.

2149
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:26,380
I ask you a couple more things, please.

2150
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:29,200
Know what these are?

2151
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:30,600
A weed.

2152
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:31,420

Sorry.

2158
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:18,780
I don't know anything about plants or things like that, but
you should ask Rebecca.

2159
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,600
She used to live on a farm.

2160
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:21,880
She'd know.

2161
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:23,380
She'd know.

2162
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,460
Why is she'd know?

2163
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:26,620
Thank you.

2164
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:27,860
Probably be back later.

2165
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:30,460
Didn't we say you traded for herbs?

2166
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:36,860
Yeah, that's why I was trying to get that to kind of not do
the, like to kind of be like, hey, you should know you

2167
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:39,640
traded for herbs, but it didn't have it as like a.

2168
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:43,080
Maybe I looked under the wrong thing.

2169
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:44,240
Well, we can go back.

2170
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:47,220
Ding, ding, ding!

2171
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,660
Just a few more questions if you don't mind.

2172
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:52,860
Do you know what these are?

2173
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:57,100
Ah, magic mint.

2174
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:58,680
Where did you find this?

2175
02:16:58,700 --> 02:16:59,080
Where are we?

2176
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:00,020
Magic mint.

2177
02:17:00,560 --> 02:17:01,700
Salvia divinorum.

2178
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:03,760
I used to grow it years ago.

2179
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:05,480
It makes you trip.

2180
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:06,440
In what way?

2181
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:07,980
It's a hallucinogenic.

2182
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:10,020
And legal.

2183
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:10,620
Oh.

2184
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:11,500
Quite a dangerous combination.

2185
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:12,520
Oh, wait.

2186
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:13,520
Do you use it?

2187
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:13,980
Me?

2188
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:14,900
No.

2189
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,660
No, I don't even take medicines.

2190
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:20,100
I, um, I like to stay pure.

2191
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:25,180
I didn't expect Rebecca to know about growing drugs.

2192
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:28,680
No, she claims not to use them herself, but I'm not so sure.

2193
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:30,260
Drugs!

2194
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:32,300
It's a magic mint!

2195
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:34,300
That's all for the moment.

2196
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:34,840
Thank you.

2197
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:40,040
I'm, I'm, I, I am, I am, I'm normal.

2198
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:41,500
I'm not a drug.

2199
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:44,760
I'm not a drug!

2200
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:45,640
I'm not a drug!

2201
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:48,160
I'm not!

2202
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,100
The salvia!

2203
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:49,600
What was it?

2204
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:51,420
Salvia...

2205
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:52,320
Something something.

2206
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:55,500
I didn't know Magic Mike had a sequel.

2207
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:58,020
Oh, I keep going the wrong way.

2208
02:17:58,660 --> 02:17:59,560
Here we go.

2209
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:04,060
That's what...

2210
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:04,700
M-M!

2211
02:18:05,060 --> 02:18:06,160
Magic Mint!

2212
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:08,080
Look at the spider.

2213
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:08,660
Right there.

2214
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:10,020
Ask about a few more things, please.

2215
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:14,240
Ever heard of salvia divinorum?

2216
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:14,920
Divinorum?

2217
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,720
It sounds like a...

2218
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:17,140
What's that?

2219
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:17,780
Skin cream.

2220
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:20,640
It's not a skin cream, no.

2221
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:22,080
A hallucinogenic me, though.

2222
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:22,360
Really?

2223
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:24,060
Don't know much about plants.

2224
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:24,620
Oh.

2225
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:25,820
So you've never heard of Salvia?

2226
02:18:27,140 --> 02:18:27,320
No.

2227
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:28,280
No.

2228
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:29,440
You're such a liar.

2229
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:36,090
How can I get...

2230
02:18:36,090 --> 02:18:37,210
I've never heard of Salvia.

2231
02:18:40,530 --> 02:18:43,850
If you're not a drug, then why do I get so giggly if I take
your stream?

2232
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:46,950
Yeah, he says with the hooves.

2233
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:47,810
in the background.

2234
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:48,490
I know, right?

2235
02:18:48,630 --> 02:18:49,050
What the heck?

2236
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:49,630
This guy.

2237
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:52,050
Wait, how can we get him in his lie?

2238
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:03,710
Um...

2239
02:19:03,710 --> 02:19:04,710
If you know they're...

2240
02:19:04,710 --> 02:19:05,390
Wait, let's see.

2241
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:07,910
Really?

2242
02:19:08,390 --> 02:19:09,970
Okay, uh...

2243
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:19,240
I mean, watching you is quite a trip, and that I trip over
you because you're below line of sight.

2244
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:21,180
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fight you.

2245
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:22,240
I'm gonna fight you.

2246
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:25,760
I'm gonna fight

2247
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:33,940
you.

2248
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2249
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:41,180
Oh, here's the traded herbal tea.

2250
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,480
What doesn't know much about plants.

2251
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:45,040
There we go, right?

2252
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:45,940
What?

2253
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:49,740
He would have to know about herbs to trade.

2254
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:51,000
Wait.

2255
02:19:51,340 --> 02:19:52,180
Oh, come on.

2256
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:56,620
Anklebiter.

2257
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:57,800
Guys, come on.

2258
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:59,560
We're solving a murder here.

2259
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:02,580
We're solving a murder here.

2260
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:07,800
I'm not going after any ankles.

2261
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:17,510
Fight rhymes with height, so I don't think you'd be very
good at it.

2262
02:20:19,050 --> 02:20:21,270
Oh, fight rhymes with height.

2263
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:27,840
Whose dog is this?

2264
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:30,960
Don't change the subject.

2265
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:33,240
The packet?

2266
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:45,500
Want some cookery con- but he doesn't- Oh yeah, you'd have
to know about plans to win comp.

2267
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:46,140
What?

2268
02:20:46,660 --> 02:20:52,040
You'd have to know about plants and herbs to win a cookery
competition, right?

2269
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:53,900
You'd have to know what you're putting in.

2270
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:56,500
Uh...

2271
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:00,540
Hmm...

2272
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:02,060
Uh...

2273
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:07,320
He knew it was mint.

2274
02:21:07,440 --> 02:21:07,880
Yeah!

2275
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:10,340
Contains mint leaves.

2276
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:13,880
Doesn't know about plants.

2277
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:15,600
Oh.

2278
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:23,700
Considering both your effect on us and your hue is magic
mint, you sound mighty sussy right now.

2279
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:26,800
I'm a detective, I'm a detective.

2280
02:21:30,730 --> 02:21:32,530
He said it was ordinary mint, right.

2281
02:21:33,730 --> 02:21:35,590
Never heard, I'm just going to try it, never.

2282
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:37,990
Because it's not called the magic mint.

2283
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:42,630
I

2284
02:21:55,230 --> 02:21:57,010
don't think the order matters.

2285
02:22:01,730 --> 02:22:03,010
Magical girl mint.

2286
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:04,430
Yeah, now we're talking.

2287
02:22:04,710 --> 02:22:05,470
Now we're talking.

2288
02:22:21,350 --> 02:22:23,630
I guess we could go ask other people.

2289
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:27,510
Let's just go ask other people, I suppose.

2290
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:39,980
Hello, hello, Emma.

2291
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:41,900
Do you know what Wasalia is?

2292
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:49,460
You can still solve crime as a gumshoe, even if for you,
It's more like a gum boat.

2293
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:50,820
What does that even mean?

2294
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:53,620
Ever heard of Salvia Divinorum?

2295
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:54,280
Divinorum.

2296
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:55,620
Yeah, yeah, I've heard of it.

2297
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:56,440
Oh, you have?

2298
02:22:56,860 --> 02:22:57,080
Yeah.

2299
02:22:57,800 --> 02:22:59,060
A hallucinogenic drug.

2300
02:22:59,520 --> 02:22:59,880
Ever tried it?

2301
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:00,600
Oh my God, is that?

2302
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:03,060
No, I've never taken any illegal substances.

2303
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,920
Never taken illegal substances.

2304
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:12,420
Okay.

2305
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:15,200
Why do I feel like she said something that she had before?

2306
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:18,780
It's lit.

2307
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:19,660
Yeah, did it do...

2308
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:29,140
the other Rebecca said it was legal later he's like Jim
Carey he really has like that effect ever heard of salvia

2309
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:38,700

yeah you mean the drug and yeah yeah flip it around did we

2310
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:44,820

thing it messes with your brain I've never tried any other

2311
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:53,020
drugs either one nothing like that nothing hallucinogenic
Never tried any other hallucinogenic drugs.

2312
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,260
Has tried Salvia a few times.

2313
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:01,140
Remember, we would have favors.

2314
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:04,280
Good luck.

2315
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:09,840
Wicked Wint.

2316
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:14,700
Magic mint to wicked wint.

2317
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:18,500
There is no lilac, there's only wicked wint.

2318
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:21,240
Something's not right.

2319
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:23,460
You think so?

2320
02:24:28,210 --> 02:24:30,230
I don't think so, so far.

2321
02:24:34,030 --> 02:24:34,430
Uh.

2322
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:42,830
No, I don't think so, so far.

2323
02:24:46,250 --> 02:24:46,410
Hmm.

2324
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:47,830
Well.

2325
02:24:50,010 --> 02:24:53,410
Hasn't seen the leads before, but he said, wait, if he's
tried it before, then maybe?

2326
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:55,870
No, okay.

2327
02:24:56,670 --> 02:24:56,810
Hmm.

2328
02:24:56,830 --> 02:24:58,830
That's it for the time being, thank you.

2329
02:25:03,370 --> 02:25:05,270
That didn't work though.

2330
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:07,750
Let's try Atlas.

2331
02:25:11,330 --> 02:25:12,190
Yeah, my jacket.

2332
02:25:12,690 --> 02:25:13,890
I'm cold now.

2333
02:25:14,230 --> 02:25:15,630
I'm putting my jacket back on.

2334
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:19,590
I'm putting my jacket back on.

2335
02:25:19,790 --> 02:25:20,050
I'm cold.

2336
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:34,860
How old is this game?

2337
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,640
Keep the Ectoplasm warm.

2338
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:42,100
I'm like, no, I'm like kind of, I'm kind of like shrimpin'
because I'm getting cold.

2339
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:45,660
Sold beer to James, but doesn't get along with him.

2340
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:49,020
A few more questions, please.

2341
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:54,840
Have you ever heard of Salvia Divinorum?

2342
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:55,640
No.

2343
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:57,880
What is it?

2344
02:25:58,220 --> 02:25:59,800
It's a hallucinogenic plant.

2345
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:00,780
A legal one.

2346
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:02,300
At least for the moment.

2347
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:03,740
Is it still legal?

2348
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:05,620
2014, 2015?

2349
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:06,580
My job.

2350
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:08,640
That's the only drug I need.

2351
02:26:08,660 --> 02:26:10,380
As trite as that may sound.

2352
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:13,400
Do you know any students who may have used Toast Nidgins?

2353
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,140
No, no, my students aren't interested in that kind of thing.

2354
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:22,680
Besides, no one is allowed drugs or alcohol onto the site.

2355
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:25,640
I don't think anyone has ever brought drugs to Atlas.

2356
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,080
Do you have any medicines on site at all?

2357
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:30,260
No, we're not allowed insurance purposes.

2358
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,380
Uh-huh.

2359
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:34,480
Doesn't keep medicines on site.

2360
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:38,500
Doesn't allow drugs or alcohol on Atlas premises.

2361
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:40,780
But...

2362
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:43,480
I mean, Kate was drunk at the last meeting.

2363
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:46,240
Well, I guess it doesn't mean she brought it, but hold on,
let me just try it.

2364
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:49,340
No, okay.

2365
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:51,560
Isn't he drinking?

2366
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:52,620
I know, right?

2367
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:54,100
What the heck?

2368
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:58,840
He's drinking right now.

2369
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:03,120
Unfortunately, that is not a thing that is not in our
evidence.

2370
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:04,820
Okay, thank you.

2371
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:05,980
Probably be back later.

2372
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:16,960
Yeah, like something like an EpiPen, or like, you could keep
like a Tylenol, like just some sort of ibuprofen, something

2373
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:17,660
on...

2374
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:19,800
Seems like you should.

2375
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:20,360
I don't know.

2376
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:22,160
I guess you don't have to.

2377
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:31,680
Let's go ask Simon about not getting along with James, but
he does sell beer.

2378
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:33,380
I don't think he still does.

2379
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:34,240
We'll try it, though.

2380
02:27:38,330 --> 02:27:39,890
Selling it, but only sold to James.

2381
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:46,740
Uh...

2382
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:47,980
Wait, do we not have...

2383
02:27:47,980 --> 02:27:50,420
Maybe we don't have a thing that says...

2384
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,060
He doesn't... Oh, doesn't see James very often.

2385
02:27:54,180 --> 02:27:56,940
No, I don't think we have one that says that he doesn't like
James.

2386
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:03,520
Yeah, I don't think so.

2387
02:28:04,380 --> 02:28:04,940
Never mind.

2388
02:28:06,460 --> 02:28:07,400
That's all for the moment.

2389
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:07,940
Thank you.

2390
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:10,620
Oh, hint.

2391
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:11,280
Hint.

2392
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:12,740
Show tip, please.

2393
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:13,920
Better try the woods again!

2394
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:17,280
Ryan about the packet of leaves.

2395
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:19,020
Oh, I forgot.

2396
02:28:19,580 --> 02:28:20,080
Thank you, Gim.

2397
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:29,480
The game is so good at being like, oh, by the way, I guess
when I've truly run out of, like, things,

2398
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:34,340
I just go back to the woods.

2399
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:35,800
I just gotta start walking around.

2400
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:38,380
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

2401
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:39,440
These hints are sassy.

2402
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:41,720
You're like, I was like, you didn't ask it.

2403
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:43,340
Do you know what this is?

2404
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,180
M-M.

2405
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:47,200
Looks like chopped tea bags.

2412
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:49,020
a policeman and that's supposed to make what difference
exactly.

2413
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,560
It means that you do exactly what I tell you to do.

2414
02:29:53,740 --> 02:29:54,180
Or what?

2415
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:54,860
Or what?

2416
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:55,520
Or you arrest me?

2417
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:57,060
Now I'll give you a fine this time.

2418
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:00,560
So if I do something that you don't like, I have to give you
some money.

2419
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:03,120
What happens if you do something that I don't like?

2420
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:04,540
You're going to give me some money?

2421
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:07,940
Look, I do not have time to discuss it at the moment.

2422
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:08,780
Can you just go?

2423
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:11,260
Who is this guy?

2424
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,080
Oh my god.

2425
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:14,880
Pathetic.

2426
02:30:15,860 --> 02:30:16,980
Oh my god.

2427
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:18,720
No.

2428
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:22,650
What did he even write?

2429
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:30,570
That's actually pretty clean for like a carving on a tree.

2430
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:34,730
What a prize brat.

2431
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:37,370
But why would he carve that into a tree?

2432
02:30:37,690 --> 02:30:41,330
Well, he's a diehard rock fan or there's more to that symbol
than meets the eye.

2433
02:30:42,530 --> 02:30:44,750
That's the symbol for love.

2434
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:47,010
That's love.

2435
02:30:48,390 --> 02:30:50,790
No, the one with your thumb in.

2436
02:30:50,810 --> 02:31:09,560
is the horns but the one with your thumb out is a love not
very rock and what if he just got it wrong what if he

2437
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:21,520
thought he was doing the the rock and roll but he did love
instead because he's silly are we just gonna go ask

2438
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:30,020
everybody about this now all right time this game is so
funny hello do you know anything about this symbol anything

2439
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:41,520
about the symbol go yeah spider-man what if he's a big more
questions if you don't mind spider-man fan if I did this

2440
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:49,880
would that mean anything to you it's a devil sign isn't it
no is that what you're getting at inspector this is not

2441
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:54,620
something you use on the course it's not something we use on
the course inspector i don't even know what that could

2442
02:31:54,620 --> 02:32:07,860
possibly mean exactly thinks the fingers is a devil sign
okay that's no he's wrong guys i shouldn't read anything to

2443
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:21,580
you just this is the most bizarre like this just does the
most off the walls like pose position Oh my goodness.

2444
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:25,240
A couple more questions if that's okay.

2445
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:35,460
If I did this, would that mean anything to you?

2446
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:37,140
Who did you see doing that?

2447
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:40,260
Someone in the woods carving it into a tree.

2448
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:41,140
That was Kyle.

2449
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:42,000
Kyle!

2450
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:43,460
It's a guy from the course.

2451
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:44,100
He's an idiot.

2452
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:45,280
And where does he live?

2453
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:46,160
I can't remember.

2454
02:32:46,300 --> 02:32:47,400
Somewhere outside the village?

2455
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:48,540
He's getting outside every single room.

2456
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:51,140
The three fingers thing is something the students started
doing.

2457
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:52,560
It's something from the course.

2458
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:55,080
The Three Freedoms.

2459
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:55,980
What?

2460
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:56,420
What?

2461
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:57,540
The Three Freedoms.

2462
02:32:58,040 --> 02:32:59,060
It's from the course.

2463
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:01,040
It's a phrase.

2464
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,220
Oh my god, this place...

2465
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:02,560
Free to be free.

2466
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:03,280
This is a cult.

2467
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:04,980
Free yourself from the things that are holding you back.

2468
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:06,040
Oh, it's such a cult.

2469
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:06,820
Oh, it's such a cult.

2470
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:08,460
Things that stop you being successful.

2471
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:09,520
What are they?

2472
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:11,700
There's a fear of failure.

2473
02:33:13,300 --> 02:33:13,780
Guilt.

2474
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
And a doubting.

2475
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:17,160
A self-doubt.

2476
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:18,380
You believe that?

2477
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:19,100
Yeah.

2478
02:33:19,540 --> 02:33:21,040
Guilt ruins lives.

2479
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:31,540
it stops you looking forward it serves no practical purpose
it's basically destructive right that's why he doesn't feel

2480
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:39,080
guilty about killing Kate free to be free not the most
original slogan but I wonder how far this freedom goes think

2481
02:33:39,080 --> 02:33:50,080
if it was a middle finger it just went around showing it off
and asking if I did this to you does it mean anything yeah

2482
02:33:50,080 --> 02:34:03,300
Atlas phrase free to be free thank you thank you simon your
help was very intriguing actually well i should ask

2483
02:34:03,300 --> 02:34:13,540
everybody else too the game's gonna get mad at me if i did
this why does it look so crazed every time he does it no why

2484
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:28,340
it's okay thanks it's okay it's fine that's all right do you

2485
02:34:28,340 --> 02:34:34,380

did they say about it they said that you shouldn't feel

2486
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:43,480
guilty if you do something wrong i don't agree with that oh
no no no i think you should feel guilty if you do something

2487
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:52,000
wrong what did simon think i don't know but i don't think
you agree with that either Hmm.

2488
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:54,420
Doubt Simon agrees with it fully.

2489
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:56,000
Oh, no.

2490
02:34:56,180 --> 02:34:57,400
They're going to break up.

2491
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:04,820
I heard you can buy love at the store for 250 yen.

2492
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:06,820
Awesome.

2493
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,880
So cheap.

2494
02:35:16,460 --> 02:35:16,920
Hmm.

2495
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:18,240
Thank you.

2496
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:19,420
Probably be back later.

2497
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:21,440
Huh.

2498
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,660
I mean, she cheated.

2499
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:24,080
Yeah, yeah.

2500
02:35:24,860 --> 02:35:26,220
Yeah, yeah.

2501
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:32,340
Let's go back to Atlas because we're going to catch him in
his lies.

2502
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:34,080
Contradiction.

2503
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:35,100
Contradiction.

2504
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:43,000
There we go.

2505
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:47,100
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

2506
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:48,820
Try.

2507
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:49,600
There we go.

2508
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,320
Ask you a couple more things, please.

2509
02:35:52,380 --> 02:35:53,020
Yes.

2510
02:35:55,220 --> 02:36:03,820
bit about the phrase free to be free if i did this six seven
hands to be free my favorite motto well we teach our

2511
02:36:03,820 --> 02:36:13,220
students that people well they suffer from excessive guilt
don't they excessive self-criticism excessive doubt evils of

2512
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:23,280
excess we call them and we tell our students that if they
rid themselves of these evils then they're free to realize

2513
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:31,700
their full potential who came up with I have a background in
psychology honestly I don't look so surprised inspector

2514
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:42,180
there's an intellect lurking in here when did you come up
with the phrase when we were based at the village hall when

2515
02:36:42,180 --> 02:36:51,080
I say we I came up with the phrase dad's more the money man
and very successful at it too are I here oh he's successful

2516
02:36:51,080 --> 02:36:57,220
but he's not a creative man dad suffers from a lack of
imagination.

2517
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,280
I see.

2518
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:02,640
Excuse me, Minto.

2519
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:04,540
Does this mean anything to you?

2520
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:07,440
Hard times.

2521
02:37:07,880 --> 02:37:08,620
It's been a while.

2522
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:09,860
Welcome back!

2523
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:11,200
Thank you.

2524
02:37:13,220 --> 02:37:14,820
Alright, let's see.

2525
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:18,200
Well...

2526
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,020
I'm gonna try.

2527
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:25,980
Thanks to the fingers is a devil sign, but he was into...

2528
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:27,300
Yeah.

2529
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:29,780
He would know.

2530
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:31,020
No, he doesn't know.

2531
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,040
Mr. Aviyam!

2532
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:35,200
Thank you so much for the part.

2533
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:36,200
Thank you.

2534
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:37,260
Thank you.

2535
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:38,980
Let's see.

2536
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:43,020
Doesn't know how the finger symbol could be used.

2537
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:49,350
But he invented the phrase maybe?

2538
02:37:59,910 --> 02:38:08,610
No, why can't we say that we were told that this is what
this means?

2539
02:38:11,550 --> 02:38:11,990
Hmm.

2540
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:21,090
Why can't we say, hey, someone from your class believes this
and learned it from you?

2541
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:22,410
Come on, game.

2542
02:38:22,850 --> 02:38:24,130
Let me be, let me take over.

2543
02:38:24,270 --> 02:38:25,530
Let me be the detective.

2544
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:28,430
Let me be the detective.

2545
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:28,910
That's all for the moment.

2546
02:38:29,050 --> 02:38:29,810
Thank you.

2547
02:38:31,810 --> 02:38:33,970
Said there's something that the students started doing.

2548
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:38,530
Yeah, but surely he would say the phrase in class.

2549
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:40,970
and they would like do that and he would notice, right?

2550
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:50,470
Like, I feel like that's something that he would notice.

2551
02:38:53,090 --> 02:38:54,850
Is anybody in the restaurant?

2552
02:38:57,130 --> 02:38:57,350
Nope.

2553
02:38:58,070 --> 02:38:58,810
Slow night.

2554
02:39:01,830 --> 02:39:02,950
Slow night.

2555
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:03,750
Ring a ling.

2556
02:39:04,330 --> 02:39:05,110
We gotta ask everybody.

2557
02:39:05,310 --> 02:39:06,630
Just a few more questions if you don't mind.

2558
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:08,510
Does this mean anything to you?

2559
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:11,350
If I did this, would that mean anything to you?

2560
02:39:12,110 --> 02:39:13,430
Why is it meant to mean something?

2561
02:39:13,790 --> 02:39:15,050
No, no, it's okay.

2562
02:39:15,230 --> 02:39:17,430
She's so like...

2563
02:39:17,430 --> 02:39:22,750
Her acting is... I can't tell if this is just how she is,
but her acting is so good because she's so aloof.

2564
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:27,410
Ever heard the phrase, free to be free?

2565
02:39:27,890 --> 02:39:28,970
Do you mean the Atlas thing?

2566
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:29,710
Yes, I have.

2567
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:30,470
Know what it means?

2568
02:39:30,910 --> 02:39:32,670
It means being free of guilt.

2569
02:39:33,090 --> 02:39:34,310
What do you think about that?

2570
02:39:34,750 --> 02:39:36,350
You mean, do I think it's a bad thing?

2571
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:37,130
Do you?

2572
02:39:37,370 --> 02:39:40,030
I mean, surely if you have done something wrong.

2573
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:41,710
Oh, but that's the point, Inspector.

2574
02:39:42,470 --> 02:39:46,310
Most people spend their time feeling guilty over nothing,
and that's not a good thing.

2575
02:39:48,510 --> 02:39:50,350
But if you have done something wrong...

2576
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:55,170
If you have done something wrong...

2577
02:39:55,170 --> 02:39:56,730
Be back later on, if that's okay.

2578
02:39:56,930 --> 02:39:57,970
Be back later on?

2579
02:39:58,670 --> 02:39:59,330
Say you.

2580
02:40:01,130 --> 02:40:01,610
Hmm.

2581
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:07,740
You think she's the only one that doesn't seem completely
insane?

2582
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:08,860
That makes sense.

2583
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:10,240
Is it?

2584
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:10,400
Oh.

2585
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:12,060
Anybody here?

2586
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:13,500
Anybody outside?

2587
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:15,780
No.

2588
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:17,500
Alright.

2589
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:19,020
Totals!

2590
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:20,120
Chip Cheerio!

2591
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:24,020
Alright.

2592
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:29,340
If you don't feel guilty, you probably do more evil.

2593
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:30,740
Do evil.

2594
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:31,140
Spider!

2595
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:33,000
Ask about a few more things, please.

2596
02:40:34,120 --> 02:40:35,060
Do you know this?

2597
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:45,700
If I did that, would it mean anything to you yeah it's a
satanism symbol satanists use it have you ever seen anyone

2598
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:55,920
using it lots of people politicians presidents ceos have you
ever seen anyone local using it not that i remember

2599
02:40:55,920 --> 02:41:05,600
everybody's using the symbol no you guys it literally is
love in sign language at least American Sign Language.

2600
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:09,860
Minky said it meant love.

2601
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:10,460
It does!

2602
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:12,420
It's love in American Sign Language.

2603
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:26,160
Hasn't seen anyone locally using it.

2604
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:29,820
Well, honestly, do you meet anyone locally?

2605
02:41:30,380 --> 02:41:31,880
Do you see anyone in this town?

2606
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:33,020
Oh, whoops, dig it!

2607
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:34,460
I didn't mean to do that.

2608
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:35,220
I meant to ask him them.

2609
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:41,140
Because I think there's only like three people in this town
and you guys never It seemed to interact.

2610
02:41:41,660 --> 02:41:42,040
It's okay.

2611
02:41:44,060 --> 02:41:47,140
Ever hear the phrase, free to be free?

2612
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:48,940
Heard anyone use that?

2613
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:49,700
Nah.

2614
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:51,520
What is it?

2615
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:51,960
A song?

2616
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:52,860
A song?

2617
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:53,860
No, I don't think so.

2618
02:41:54,300 --> 02:41:55,080
Doesn't matter.

2619
02:41:55,640 --> 02:41:55,780
Oh.

2620
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:58,080
Never heard the phrase.

2621
02:41:59,200 --> 02:41:59,940
All right.

2622
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:08,100
Let's go ask the chief maybe he knows of direction he wants
me to go in with this.

2623
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:12,960
I'm gonna call the chief.

2624
02:42:15,740 --> 02:42:16,340
Chief?

2625
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:17,860
Help.

2626
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:26,660
Chief, pick up.

2627
02:42:28,360 --> 02:42:29,580
Chief, pick up.

2628
02:42:32,980 --> 02:42:39,960
It's so funny to imagine this guy constantly entering and
leaving people's houses all within the span of like an hour.

2629
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:42,480
Which is the word.

2630
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:44,360
It's only 7 p.m.

2631
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:45,640
We got here at 5.

2632
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:54,840
In the span of two hours, we have gone to this...

2633
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:56,380
Alright, help me, help me, him.

2634
02:43:04,300 --> 02:43:05,400
Yes, Mito, what do you need?

2635
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:06,280
Sorry for not picking up.

2636
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:08,340
I need a British expert.

2637
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:11,740
Better try the woods again.

2638
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:12,480
Okay, game.

2639
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:16,600
It really, it really is, like, if you don't know what to do,
go back to the woods.

2640
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:21,440
Over here?

2641
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:22,940
Oh my god.

2642
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:25,780
Who are you?

2643
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:28,480
What are you?

2644
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:29,640
Private eye?

2645
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:30,480
Yeah.

2646
02:43:30,620 --> 02:43:32,200
Uh, no, I'm a police inspector.

2647
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:33,620
Who are you looking for?

2648
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:36,240
I'm investigating a death in the village.

2649
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:39,040
That student then.

2650
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:40,960
They did one last year too.

2651
02:43:41,360 --> 02:43:41,980
Same place.

2652
02:43:42,220 --> 02:43:42,460
What?

2653
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:44,380
Did what?

2654
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:45,760
A ritual?

2655
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:47,420
Drowned a student.

2656
02:43:47,580 --> 02:43:47,960
Oh!

2657
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:50,380
Ask that psycho about it.

2658
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:54,440
He runs that business cult thing up at the...

2659
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:55,660
It's a big house.

2660
02:43:55,820 --> 02:43:55,900
Ah!

2661
02:43:58,040 --> 02:44:00,000
A bunch of nutjobs.

2662
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:01,540
Y'all.

2663
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,360
Hey, what was the student's name?

2664
02:44:08,390 --> 02:44:08,810
Liam.

2665
02:44:10,610 --> 02:44:11,090
Liam!

2666
02:44:12,270 --> 02:44:12,890
Oh, sorry.

2667
02:44:13,030 --> 02:44:15,770
How can you leave that hobo's bottle alone too?

2668
02:44:19,130 --> 02:44:20,970
Atlas's reputation precedes them.

2669
02:44:21,690 --> 02:44:23,350
I think I might call the station.

2670
02:44:23,890 --> 02:44:25,150
Find out a bit more about this.

2671
02:44:25,430 --> 02:44:25,970
Liam.

2672
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:28,050
We were so right the whole time!

2673
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:30,170
We were so right!

2674
02:44:31,050 --> 02:44:32,550
Hello, DCI Jones speaking.

2675
02:44:32,810 --> 02:44:33,930
Mike, it's Jenks.

2676
02:44:34,130 --> 02:44:35,710
Alright, Jenks, I thought you'd clocked off tonight.

2677
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:38,290
Yeah, the chief's putting you on a case tonight, the Edenton
girl.

2678
02:44:38,430 --> 02:44:39,730
Friday night, you poor sod.

2679
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:40,950
I thought that was sorted out anyway.

2680
02:44:41,070 --> 02:44:41,730
I wish it was.

2681
02:44:42,210 --> 02:44:43,410
Listen, are you near a computer?

2682
02:44:43,850 --> 02:44:44,730
I can be.

2683
02:44:44,930 --> 02:44:45,410
Yeah, go on.

2684
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:47,270
Do you know anything about a death last year?

2685
02:44:47,350 --> 02:44:49,330
Someone called Liam in Edenton Village?

2686
02:44:49,650 --> 02:44:51,010
I don't remember it.

2687
02:44:51,310 --> 02:44:52,270
Hang on, something like that.

2688
02:44:53,370 --> 02:44:54,170
Edenton Village.

2689
02:44:54,430 --> 02:44:54,710
Oh!

2690
02:44:56,290 --> 02:45:04,370

2693
02:45:27,990 --> 02:45:30,150
I don't think that's...

2694
02:45:30,150 --> 02:45:31,390
Liam's death.

2695
02:45:31,990 --> 02:45:36,650
You can just imagine him on the side of the road sketching
out the little tombstone.

2696
02:45:39,270 --> 02:45:41,770
He's just like...

2697
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:42,710
La la la.

2698
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:45,030
Liam's death.

2699
02:45:48,050 --> 02:45:48,710
Spider.

2700
02:45:48,770 --> 02:45:51,530
Do you know about Liam?

2701
02:45:52,150 --> 02:45:53,090
Did you know Liam?

2702
02:45:54,350 --> 02:45:55,290
Liam who?

2703
02:45:57,270 --> 02:46:08,030

on a different course what course was Liam on can't remember

2704
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:16,130

about Liam was when he killed himself right so you don't

2705
02:46:16,130 --> 02:46:25,710

this guy is a load of shit James James degrees in plant

2706
02:46:25,710 --> 02:46:36,010

degree is in plant science but you don't seem to know

2707
02:46:36,010 --> 02:46:43,530
anything about plants well still got a lot to learn if
salvia is legal then you've never heard of salvia didn't say

2708
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:51,930
that so you have maybe maybe if it's legal then why would
you lie it's legal why not oh yeah see what do you do with

2709
02:46:51,930 --> 02:46:58,070
it use it for explorative purposes Is Sylvia like a...

2710
02:46:58,070 --> 02:46:59,590
Does this involve anybody else?

2711
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:00,210
Why?

2712
02:47:00,390 --> 02:47:03,970
Do you sell it or give it to anybody else?

2713
02:47:04,590 --> 02:47:05,110
Sure.

2714
02:47:06,050 --> 02:47:07,430
Yeah, it's just for me, nobody else.

2715
02:47:08,210 --> 02:47:09,950
And that's the only drug you grow, is it?

2716
02:47:10,410 --> 02:47:12,270
Feel free to go and look if you want.

2717
02:47:12,630 --> 02:47:14,030
It's okay, I'll look later.

2718
02:47:16,130 --> 02:47:17,170
The only drug he grows...

2719
02:47:17,170 --> 02:47:19,150
Not sure I believe that, James.

2720
02:47:19,950 --> 02:47:23,770
Then again, would someone growing illegal drugs bother
growing a legal one?

2721
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:25,330
Mm-hmm.

2722
02:47:26,870 --> 02:47:28,770
So, it's updated.

2723
02:47:29,170 --> 02:47:30,450
Doesn't grow any other drugs.

2724
02:47:31,330 --> 02:47:32,910
Uses salvia for meditation.

2725
02:47:33,310 --> 02:47:35,430
Grows salvia for his private use only.

2726
02:47:41,560 --> 02:47:44,020
I don't think we have anything else for that.

2727
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:45,440
Thank you.

2728
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:46,760
Probably be back later.

2729
02:47:48,980 --> 02:47:49,840
Shroom's level.

2730
02:47:50,040 --> 02:47:51,020
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2731
02:47:53,520 --> 02:48:00,180
I only hear about, like, celebrities going to try the IUS
guy, and they're like, changed my life.

2732
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:02,560
You're like, okay.

2733
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:07,780
Let's go ask Rebecca about Liam.

2734
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:19,260
Ask you a couple more things, please.

2735
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:20,220
Liam.

2736
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:21,300
Liam.

2737
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:22,760
Wait, okay, yeah, yeah.

2738
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:23,080
Liam.

2739
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:24,360
Ask.

2740
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:26,340
What do you know about Liam?

2741
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:28,420
You mean Liam who took his life?

2742
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:32,940
He used to play in a band, Black Rock or something.

2743
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:34,720
No, Black Stone.

2744
02:48:35,240 --> 02:48:35,920
Black Stone.

2745
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:36,200
Black Stone.

2746
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:39,400
Yeah, yeah, I used to let them play in here sometimes at the
weekends.

2747
02:48:39,540 --> 02:48:40,080
They were quite good.

2748
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:40,360
Oh, yeah.

2749
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:40,500
Yeah.

2750
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:41,980
Did you know there was anything wrong?

2751
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:43,760
I mean, why he might have?

2752
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:46,640
No, I didn't know him very well.

2753
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:49,400
I didn't know him very well.

2754
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:51,440
But you let them.

2755
02:48:53,360 --> 02:48:54,440
You let them in.

2756
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:58,380
You let them play every week and you don't know.

2757
02:48:58,820 --> 02:48:59,900
You didn't talk to him ever.

2758
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:01,200
Hmm.

2759
02:49:04,870 --> 02:49:06,230
Blackstone shooter.

2760
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:09,410
The hand gesture.

2761
02:49:09,690 --> 02:49:10,390
What about it?

2762
02:49:10,990 --> 02:49:11,890
We already did that

2763
02:49:16,420 --> 02:49:18,020
Okay, that's all for the moment.

2764
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:19,000
Thank you.

2765
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:20,140
I think we're good.

2766
02:49:20,380 --> 02:49:33,020
Let's go to Simon and Emma Emma's gonna be like I also dated
him a few more questions if you don't mind What do you know

2767
02:49:33,020 --> 02:49:36,500
about a student called Liam committed suicide last year?

2768
02:49:38,060 --> 02:49:43,120
Um, only that I didn't know really what Oh, yeah, you said
that about everybody.

2769
02:49:43,740 --> 02:49:43,740
Okay.

2770
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:44,700
Wow.

2771
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:45,680
That's really it.

2772
02:49:45,800 --> 02:49:46,840
That's really it.

2773
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:47,460
That's okay.

2774
02:49:49,540 --> 02:49:50,680
Simon's old brood.

2775
02:49:51,140 --> 02:49:52,420
I was kind of...

2776
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:54,100
What do you know about Liam?

2777
02:49:54,460 --> 02:49:54,880
Liam.

2778
02:49:55,740 --> 02:49:56,180
Look, lad.

2779
02:49:56,860 --> 02:49:57,360
Took his life.

2780
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:59,020
Oh, that Liam.

2781
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:02,120
Yeah, yeah, I heard about him.

2782
02:50:02,540 --> 02:50:03,440
But you didn't know him.

2783
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:08,600
No, I know he went to college, but didn't really know him.

2784
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:09,520
Didn't know him.

2785
02:50:09,580 --> 02:50:10,220
It's sad, though.

2786
02:50:12,400 --> 02:50:12,800
Okay.

2787
02:50:18,480 --> 02:50:20,900
Hold on, I want to see something with Emma real quick.

2788
02:50:21,160 --> 02:50:21,760
Thank you.

2789
02:50:22,400 --> 02:50:23,180
It's a small town.

2790
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:24,100
How do they not know each other?

2791
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:25,220
That's what I'm saying.

2792
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:26,700
It's a literal village.

2793
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:35,300
I say she went to the pub.

2794
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:36,480
Didn't she...

2795
02:50:36,480 --> 02:50:39,220
I don't know why I thought she said that she...

2796
02:50:39,220 --> 02:50:39,740
Yeah.

2797
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:43,340
Went to the pub, but you don't know Liam if he played?

2798
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:44,380
You know?

2799
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:45,300
Oh.

2800
02:50:45,320 --> 02:50:46,280
Okay, I guess not.

2801
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:50,700
That's what I was thinking.

2802
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:52,980
Because it seemed like she went kind of often.

2803
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:53,880
You know what I mean?

2804
02:50:58,620 --> 02:51:00,660
Everyone is a murderer, clearly.

2805
02:51:00,980 --> 02:51:03,600
Everyone's liars and cheaters and murderers.

2806
02:51:05,740 --> 02:51:06,240
Thank you.

2807
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:07,640
Probably be back later.

2808
02:51:09,460 --> 02:51:12,080
DM was Simon's main customer for his homebrew.

2809
02:51:12,740 --> 02:51:13,660
How do you know that?

2810
02:51:19,350 --> 02:51:20,050
Let's see.

2811
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:34,100
I wish we could just go straight to his room a few more
questions if you don't mind Liam what can you tell me about

2812
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:43,140
Liam oh Liam you mean the boy who committed very unfortunate
is it did you know him oh yes yes well I say know him I met

2813
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:53,440
him in the pub seemed very happy sort of person well I say
seemed happy you can't He said the same thing about Kate.

2814
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:55,420
That she seemed happy.

2815
02:52:00,140 --> 02:52:01,420
He committed zoo.

2816
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:07,820
Nobody, how is it that nobody know?

2817
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:11,640
There's literally two people in this town and nobody knows
Liam.

2818
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:13,960
Had met Liam in the pub.

2819
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:16,000
Hmm.

2820
02:52:17,620 --> 02:52:19,940
Your history of psychology.

2821
02:52:20,580 --> 02:52:21,240
I know.

2822
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:23,620
I don't think he has a background in psychology at all.

2823
02:52:24,080 --> 02:52:25,820
He doesn't know how anybody's feeling.

2824
02:52:32,180 --> 02:52:32,700
Okay.

2825
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:33,300
Thank you.

2826
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:34,580
Probably be back later.

2827
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:38,600
Show me my tip.

2828
02:52:39,180 --> 02:52:40,480
How much does James really know?

2829
02:52:40,620 --> 02:52:42,080
You should call a chief for an update.

2830
02:52:43,780 --> 02:52:44,880
Going back to James.

2831
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:57,300
James.

2832
02:52:57,620 --> 02:52:59,360
Couple more questions, if that's okay.

2833
02:53:13,330 --> 02:53:14,070
It's better.

2834
02:53:17,550 --> 02:53:18,510
Yeah, but what haven't we asked?

2835
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:19,450
That's what I'm saying.

2836
02:53:21,270 --> 02:53:22,410
Let me go talk to the chief first.

2837
02:53:22,410 --> 02:53:23,770
That's all for the moment, thank you.

2838
02:53:23,870 --> 02:53:24,990
I'll talk to the chief first.

2839
02:53:27,730 --> 02:53:28,870
I should go find the drug guy.

2840
02:53:29,070 --> 02:53:31,050
I know the guy actually like told us stuff.

2841
02:53:32,130 --> 02:53:39,310
The one guy who's incoherent, well maybe James too, but the
one guy that couldn't help us or the one guy that's been

2842
02:53:39,310 --> 02:53:50,910
helpful or either is the one guy we're getting one guy we
gotta go back to the woods into the woods into the woods yes

2843
02:53:50,910 --> 02:53:57,810
chief bit more news right direct he does know what salvia
divinorum is but he claims it's the only drug he grows what

2844
02:53:57,810 --> 02:54:05,730
when yeah I didn't see anything else suspicious I'm not sure
but I doubt you could smoke the stuff I found you'd have to

2845
02:54:05,730 --> 02:54:09,510
dry it out first I imagine you infuse it or crush it or
something.

2846
02:54:09,530 --> 02:54:10,830
Do a bit of research, find out.

2847
02:54:10,930 --> 02:54:11,410
Does he sell it?

2848
02:54:11,610 --> 02:54:12,570
He said he doesn't.

2849
02:54:14,350 --> 02:54:22,060
Okay, I'll speak to you later, sir.

2850
02:54:22,380 --> 02:54:22,680
Bye-bye.

2851
02:54:23,060 --> 02:54:23,760
Bye-bye.

2852
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:27,280
Wait, did we ever mention the salvia to the chief?

2853
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:30,560
Did we ever mention that to him?

2854
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:32,440
Research it.

2855
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:33,340
Yeah, try it out.

2856
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:36,940
See what the effects are and such.

2857
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:39,280
All right, let's go...

2858
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:47,820
I also imagine while we're sitting in Spitter While we're
sitting in like the room with them Like going through my

2859
02:54:47,820 --> 02:54:54,480
notes I'm just kind of like I'm like flipping through like
And they're just kind of sitting on the couch Like twiddling

2860
02:54:54,480 --> 02:55:09,380
their thumbs Like This guy gonna Talk to him Just like Going
through my notes Ah Wait so Okay let's go through everything

don't know don't know didn't know about the bottles traded

2862
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:32,900

that i feel like private use but he traded it ah i got it

2863
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:44,000
when you say herbal tea do you mean salvia probably so you
traded salvia tea with Simon for his homebrew so so why did

2864
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:54,900
you say you didn't give salvia to anybody else did you give
it to anybody else oh how many people did you give it to did

2865
02:55:54,900 --> 02:56:02,040
you give it to Kate no no about Liam didn't have anything to
do with him dying if that's what you mean so you did give

2866
02:56:02,040 --> 02:56:08,440
him salvia yes I gave him salvia because he asked for it but
that's not what killed him well he committed suicide

2867
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:13,620
psychological issues that probably weren't helped by him
trying hallucinogenic drugs.

2868
02:56:13,780 --> 02:56:14,900
Didn't commit suicides.

2869
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:16,020
You don't know anything about him.

2870
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:17,140
You don't know what happened.

2871
02:56:17,460 --> 02:56:17,820
Okay.

2872
02:56:18,300 --> 02:56:19,200
So what happened then?

2873
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:20,960
Do you even know about Third Eye?

2874
02:56:21,420 --> 02:56:22,240
Third Eye?

2875
02:56:22,660 --> 02:56:24,700
You don't know about Third Eye.

2876
02:56:25,100 --> 02:56:26,020
We don't know about Third Eye.

2877
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:27,240
You know nothing about Liam's death.

2878
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:28,720
I mean, forget Salvia.

2879
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:30,240
Fine, tell me then.

2880
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:32,420
Third Eye was a cult.

2881
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:36,900
We had our very own psycho cult operating right here from
our village hall.

2882
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:38,840
And I got rid of them single-handed.

2883
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:39,460
Wait, what?

2884
02:56:39,480 --> 02:56:41,080
I'm the one who got rid of third eye.

2885
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:42,500
Did they tell you that at the station?

2886
02:56:42,980 --> 02:56:44,360
Okay, start again.

2887
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:44,980
What's happening?

2888
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:45,920
What's going on?

2889
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:46,680
You don't know anything, do you?

2890
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:47,240
Look.

2891
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:51,420
The cults, the cults, the cults are multiplying.

2892
02:56:51,740 --> 02:56:55,380
They were reeling in students, pretending to be some sort of
happy life course.

2893
02:56:55,520 --> 02:56:58,020
You know, we can make your life better sort of crap.

2894
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:02,020
Then they'll put in everyone through this brainwashing
program to make them compliant.

2895
02:57:02,520 --> 02:57:03,340
And selling them on.

2896
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:05,780
It's all there.

2897
02:57:06,360 --> 02:57:07,540
Oh my god.

2898
02:57:07,720 --> 02:57:08,040
Oh my god.

2899
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:09,320
What do you mean selling them on?

2900
02:57:09,480 --> 02:57:10,640
Selling them.

2901
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:12,200
Like objects, commodities.

2902
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:13,100
To who?

2903
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:14,980
To anyone who could afford them.

2904
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:18,740
Top politicians, famous celebrities, wealthy businessmen,
you name it.

2905
02:57:18,840 --> 02:57:19,880
What for?

2906
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:21,620
If you don't get it, do you?

2907
02:57:22,060 --> 02:57:24,500
Third eye were making and selling slaves.

2908
02:57:24,840 --> 02:57:26,520
They were black market slave traders.

2909
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:26,860
What?

2910
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:32,880
They were wiping people's personalities using ECT,
brainwashing, cocktails of hard drugs.

2911
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:35,700
Deliberately turning them into perfect slaves.

2912
02:57:35,980 --> 02:57:38,360
You know what slaves are worth on the black market these
days?

2913
02:57:38,740 --> 02:57:39,000
No.

2914
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:45,340
millions and i'm talking per slave that's why anyone who
stood up to them and threatened to go public like leon was

2915
02:57:45,340 --> 02:57:54,360
just killed off they didn't give a damn so you're saying
leon was murdered by third eye exactly what i'm saying

2916
02:57:54,360 --> 02:58:02,340
that's why i started looking into it they're all saying it
was suicide but there's no way so i mean i believe that i

2917
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:12,100
found out about him and how did you find out about all this
other stuff well stop me as can tell i met some of the

2918
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:17,480
students you could see straight away there was something
wrong they were like zombies you know i could tell when

2919
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:24,440
someone's got ect damage or when they've been through what
is it ect i mean u.s military used all these techniques back

2920
02:58:24,440 --> 02:58:35,220
in the 50s oh my god they showed all the same signs so did
you he ate the people braids that's what happened i knew

2921
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:43,840
what went on how from what people said who'd been through it
Okay, so do you know anyone I could speak to who did go

2922
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:44,480
through it?

2923
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:46,900
Truth strike again!

2924
02:58:47,340 --> 02:58:47,920
It doesn't matter.

2925
02:58:48,320 --> 02:58:50,200
Why did they close down if it wasn't true?

2926
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:54,380
They just closed down and disappeared overnight after I put
all the flyers up.

2927
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:55,860
Bit of a coincidence.

2928
02:58:56,380 --> 02:58:58,440
But that was just after Liam died.

2929
02:58:59,120 --> 02:58:59,380
Yeah.

2930
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:02,760
And do you think that had anything to do with it?

2931
02:59:02,920 --> 02:59:03,300
Wait, what?

2932
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:06,260
Maybe, but it was the flyers that bought them to close.

2933
02:59:07,700 --> 02:59:08,220
Okay.

2934
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:19,660

this is the first i've heard about third eye question is

2936
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:35,480
what's their connection with atlas if there is one the truth
about third eye do not join this dangerous cult third eyes

2937
02:59:35,480 --> 02:59:45,020
third eye are grooming from wealthy and corrupt businessmen
they pretend to be able to improve your life but in fact

2938
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:52,540
they will rob your identity and use barbaric methods like
ECT to wipe your memories and destroy your personality they

2939
02:59:52,540 --> 03:00:05,100
are based at Edenton Village Hall now why is this like super
super cult based at this tiny villages hall James took down

2940
03:00:05,100 --> 03:00:15,280
third eye by throwing the ring into the volcano what is
happening do not join those who attempt to expose them will

more things please what do you know about this not much so

2945
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:11,700
you've never seen this before you don't know anything about
third eye I don't remember seeing it now you don't recognize

2946
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:22,440
any of the symbols on it oh sorry what this is this guy
drives this that that's just just a terrible liar such a

2947
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:24,160
terrible liar

2948
03:01:28,260 --> 03:01:33,960
aha Ryan you've just told me all about the moon symbols on
the mask yeah then you're claiming you don't know anything

2949
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:37,140
about the symbols on the flyer it's all It's all the same
thing.

2950
03:01:37,220 --> 03:01:37,980
Oh, actually, yes.

2951
03:01:38,380 --> 03:01:38,920
Sorry, yes.

2952
03:01:39,240 --> 03:01:40,100
Yes, I do remember that.

2953
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:40,540
Oh, I do.

2954
03:01:40,580 --> 03:01:42,860
So what did you know about Third Eye?

2955
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:44,880
Oh, not much, really.

2956
03:01:45,020 --> 03:01:45,620
I see Cyclops.

2957
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:47,440
He's a dirty.

2958
03:01:49,720 --> 03:01:51,860
That explanation was way too short.

2959
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:53,820
He definitely is hiding something.

2960
03:01:53,900 --> 03:01:55,680
He definitely is hiding something.

2961
03:01:58,440 --> 03:02:02,380
Never came into contact with Third Eye, only knows what he
heard about Third Eye.

2962
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:06,080
Okay, I don't think we can press him on it right now.

2963
03:02:06,180 --> 03:02:13,380
I don't think we have anything to contradict that right now.

2964
03:02:15,740 --> 03:02:16,390
Wait, let me see.

2965
03:02:17,660 --> 03:02:18,440
The...

2966
03:02:18,440 --> 03:02:19,500
Did the mask again?

2967
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:24,140
By a friend who died last year.

2968
03:02:24,420 --> 03:02:24,740
Liam?

2969
03:02:26,560 --> 03:02:28,180
Did Liam make...

2970
03:02:39,330 --> 03:02:43,550
Did Liam make the mask?

2971
03:02:47,090 --> 03:02:48,010
If this was L.A.

2972
03:02:48,130 --> 03:02:50,030
Noir, we could tell just from that lying expression.

2973
03:02:50,230 --> 03:02:51,010
I know, right!

2974
03:02:57,740 --> 03:02:59,920
It's not like a contradiction that...

2975
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:04,520
There's no, like, contradiction about it, though.

2976
03:03:13,110 --> 03:03:13,430
Okay.

2977
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:16,410
Yeah, it makes sense, but how do we connect the dots?

2978
03:03:20,330 --> 03:03:23,450
Let's, you know, did I do last year?

2979
03:03:27,970 --> 03:03:30,250
I'm just gonna say about the...

2980
03:03:30,250 --> 03:03:31,370
No, okay, I didn't think so.

2981
03:03:31,430 --> 03:03:31,570
Thank you.

2982
03:03:31,890 --> 03:03:32,990
Probably be back later.

2983
03:03:33,530 --> 03:03:34,730
We will be back later.

2984
03:03:35,930 --> 03:03:39,970
We shall go around and ask about the flyer first.

2985
03:03:43,510 --> 03:03:45,830
Yeah, I don't think we quite have anything yet.

2986
03:03:46,050 --> 03:03:47,670
Just a few more questions if you don't mind.

2987
03:03:48,210 --> 03:03:48,650
Interesting.

2988
03:03:51,190 --> 03:03:54,510
Everybody's been smoking salvia and they hallucinated Leia
McGate.

2989
03:03:55,210 --> 03:03:56,090
It's all a dream.

2990
03:03:56,210 --> 03:03:57,230
Have you seen this?

2991
03:03:58,490 --> 03:04:00,530
This is way cookier than I thought I was going to be.

2992
03:04:00,530 --> 03:04:01,530
It's all over college last year.

2993
03:04:01,630 --> 03:04:02,790
James made it.

2994
03:04:03,030 --> 03:04:03,330
Idiot.

2995
03:04:04,250 --> 03:04:05,350
So you don't agree with what I'm saying?

2996
03:04:05,870 --> 03:04:07,430
No, I don't agree with anything James says.

2997
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:08,610
He's absolutely crazy.

2998
03:04:09,170 --> 03:04:12,550
He thinks that the government has been controlled by aliens
and that we're all bugged.

2999
03:04:12,750 --> 03:04:13,290
He's nuts.

3000
03:04:14,470 --> 03:04:14,870
Aliens.

3001
03:04:17,790 --> 03:04:18,190
Aliens.

3002
03:04:18,370 --> 03:04:19,010
She has said that already.

3003
03:04:19,810 --> 03:04:32,110
being thank you aliens have you seen this I think James is
on to something oh is this the thing that James did yeah

3004
03:04:32,110 --> 03:04:37,650
yeah I've heard of it what do you know about all this a
third eye I think they're called I don't really know

3005
03:04:37,650 --> 03:04:44,430
anything about it I mean I've heard about leaves death but
all I know about three eyes or whatever is is on the spire

3006
03:04:44,430 --> 03:04:50,670
so you hadn't heard about third eye no sorry Uh-huh.

3007
03:04:50,850 --> 03:04:52,690
Knows James made the flyer.

3008
03:04:53,930 --> 03:04:54,610
Doesn't know anything.

3009
03:04:54,870 --> 03:04:56,330
Well, they'd live together, right?

3010
03:05:00,600 --> 03:05:01,440
Hmm.

3011
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:05,480
He's lying.

3012
03:05:07,100 --> 03:05:07,760
Aliens?

3013
03:05:07,960 --> 03:05:09,080
More like aliens.

3014
03:05:10,740 --> 03:05:12,060
Not Liam.

3015
03:05:13,500 --> 03:05:14,140
Hmm.

3016
03:05:18,990 --> 03:05:19,830
Hmm.

3017
03:05:21,510 --> 03:05:23,070
We still haven't met Paul.

3018
03:05:24,030 --> 03:05:24,830
Interesting.

3019
03:05:24,850 --> 03:05:25,230
Interesting.

3020
03:05:26,630 --> 03:05:28,090
Interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting.

3021
03:05:35,450 --> 03:05:37,790
Masks are used during Atlas Seminars.

3022
03:05:41,170 --> 03:05:41,850
They're British.

3023
03:05:42,170 --> 03:05:43,110
They're full of beans.

3024
03:05:45,790 --> 03:05:47,290
You think Paul's an alien?

3025
03:05:48,670 --> 03:05:49,590
I think so too.

3026
03:05:50,190 --> 03:06:00,430
What if he descended to just this tiny village and has set
up shop here and he's He's an alien here.

3027
03:06:00,630 --> 03:06:01,470
Mind-controlling.

3028
03:06:03,890 --> 03:06:07,450
I just love that when a new clue is found, he walks back
around to everybody that...

3029
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:08,230
I know.

3030
03:06:08,310 --> 03:06:08,730
Thank you.

3031
03:06:08,930 --> 03:06:09,890
Probably be back later.

3032
03:06:10,050 --> 03:06:12,190
Janks is getting his steps in, man.

3033
03:06:13,690 --> 03:06:18,010
Or we're the alien because we step outside the door and then
we fast travel.

3034
03:06:18,090 --> 03:06:19,890
We teleport to another location.

3035
03:06:22,410 --> 03:06:25,210
Or we stole the bike and we've been biking around town.

3036
03:06:27,430 --> 03:06:28,410
Ask about a few more people.

3037
03:06:28,430 --> 03:06:39,130
things please a flyer do you know have you seen this before
don't take any notice of that why James Wilson is a

3038
03:06:39,130 --> 03:06:47,710
fantasist he spends his time pretending to cast spells in
the woods he's not exactly a stable person he's larping and

3039
03:06:47,710 --> 03:06:56,890
um I heard that he was involved with growing cannabis really
the weed don't correct me on that so you don't think there's

3040
03:06:56,890 --> 03:07:04,770
any truth at all to this none at all none at all she's so
smug about it none at all

3041
03:07:14,650 --> 03:07:26,870
James cast spells in the woods that's so funny why is that
like an option I wish that we could use that for something

3042
03:07:26,870 --> 03:07:32,390
you say James is right but then you say that James cast
spells in the woods

3043
03:07:35,790 --> 03:07:44,230
you're all wizard James that's all for the moment thank you
I'm using my tip you should call the chief it truly is when

3044
03:07:44,230 --> 03:07:53,430
you're like I don't know what to press it's like either go
to the woods or call the chief so far I'm having fun with

3045
03:07:53,430 --> 03:08:07,390
the story of it all but I do wish it were less of a collect
evidence go around to everybody collect evidence go I am

3046
03:08:07,390 --> 03:08:10,590
having fun though don't get me wrong I'm

3047
03:08:15,700 --> 03:08:23,220
a bit lost for ideas at the moment to be honest so true not
really did I mention the student in the woods rather

3048
03:08:23,220 --> 03:08:31,380
obnoxious student carving a devil sign into a tree Jenks
makes it very fun yeah it's to do with the phrase they use

3049
03:08:31,380 --> 03:08:37,940
on the course the three freedoms Ryan said he came up with
it the three what the three freedoms it's about getting rid

3050
03:08:37,940 --> 03:08:43,600
of your past or something They're gonna blame the Americans.

3051
03:08:44,360 --> 03:08:46,660
Gonna be like, oh, those Yankees.

3052
03:08:53,300 --> 03:08:53,640
Okay.

3053
03:08:54,040 --> 03:08:55,360
Okay, Chief, I'll call later.

3054
03:08:55,560 --> 03:08:56,160
Righto.

3055
03:08:56,660 --> 03:08:57,380
Righto.

3056
03:08:58,720 --> 03:09:00,500
All right, Chief, back to Atlas.

3057
03:09:03,800 --> 03:09:05,120
The freedom.

3058
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:06,360
Freedom!

3059
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:08,420
Eagle screech.

3060
03:09:11,320 --> 03:09:12,040
Righto.

3061
03:09:12,420 --> 03:09:14,100
Couple more questions, if that's okay.

3062
03:09:16,120 --> 03:09:22,280
So, we need to know more about this cult.

3063
03:09:24,460 --> 03:09:27,320
Only knows what he heard about the third eye.

3064
03:09:27,760 --> 03:09:29,880
Never came into contact with the third eye.

3065
03:09:32,440 --> 03:09:33,800
But this...

3066
03:09:33,800 --> 03:09:35,300
Maybe the mask.

3067
03:09:39,160 --> 03:09:40,160
Let me try it.

3068
03:09:41,500 --> 03:09:41,920
No.

3069
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:43,480
Triple goddess.

3070
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:49,340
but never came in contact.

3071
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:55,180
The necklace, what about the necklace?

3072
03:09:55,360 --> 03:09:57,120
It's been a while since we've looked at that.

3073
03:09:59,160 --> 03:09:59,880
The freedom!

3074
03:10:01,220 --> 03:10:02,120
The three freedoms.

3075
03:10:08,340 --> 03:10:09,580
I'm not quite sure.

3076
03:10:09,800 --> 03:10:10,960
I think I'm...

3077
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:11,480
Hold on.

3078
03:10:13,080 --> 03:10:14,660
Be back later on if that's okay.

3079
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:15,680
Be back.

3080
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:18,320
I'm using my tips.

3081
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,220
There must be a contradiction somewhere!

3082
03:10:22,580 --> 03:10:24,920
A few more questions, please.

3083
03:10:25,760 --> 03:10:26,780
The Atlas poster.

3084
03:10:26,980 --> 03:10:27,720
Where's that one?

3085
03:10:32,570 --> 03:10:34,510
Was the first poster for Atlas?

3086
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:36,590
Atlas name picked randomly.

3087
03:10:38,890 --> 03:10:40,050
Is there Atlas here?

3088
03:10:47,690 --> 03:10:51,010
There is like the eye, right?

3089
03:10:52,750 --> 03:10:53,830
The symbolism.

3090
03:10:54,110 --> 03:10:55,510
The symbolism is all the same.

3091
03:10:55,870 --> 03:10:57,290
He just rebranded.

3092
03:10:59,110 --> 03:11:02,830
I'm a different cult with blackjack and hookers.

3093
03:11:03,130 --> 03:11:05,470
I'm not a third eye cult.

3094
03:11:06,370 --> 03:11:09,690
I'm, see, we don't have a triangle.

3095
03:11:10,390 --> 03:11:11,890
We don't have the pyramid with the eye.

3096
03:11:12,010 --> 03:11:15,570
We have an A symbol with the eye.

3097
03:11:16,710 --> 03:11:20,270
And then we don't have, we don't have it.

3098
03:11:20,950 --> 03:11:22,390
It's not a cult, mint.

3099
03:11:22,830 --> 03:11:24,170
It is, it's a cult.

3100
03:11:24,590 --> 03:11:27,550
We're the, we're the, we're the four eyes, actually.

3101
03:11:27,790 --> 03:11:37,090
We're just a bunch of nerds out here growing salvia and
being bored in the countryside We're just we're the four

3102
03:11:37,090 --> 03:11:37,750
eyes.

3103
03:11:37,990 --> 03:11:38,700
We're the four eyes

3104
03:11:41,810 --> 03:11:46,760
Duh Well, you're gonna come and interrupt our math club like
what's

3105
03:11:51,170 --> 03:11:59,930
Let's see Hmm James said he didn't grow any other drug
except mint but that pub girl said he grew cannabis she did

3106
03:11:59,930 --> 03:12:09,570
say that but i don't think we can press him on that so so
basically you always were a kid or me and to basically like

3107
03:12:09,570 --> 03:12:17,970
her prompts wouldn't show up for for james you know what i
mean like we couldn't call him on the contradiction there is

3108
03:12:20,970 --> 03:12:28,610
that what you would do if you actually move out to the
middle of nowhere what grow a weed no if i moved out to the

3109
03:12:28,610 --> 03:12:39,890
middle I would try to become like I would I would I would
make my own like Bigfoot suit and try to become like a

3110
03:12:39,890 --> 03:12:46,970
cryptid or something you know I would I would create like I
would get really good at prosthetics and stuff and I would

3111
03:12:46,970 --> 03:12:54,230
make sure that I go to like populated campgrounds and things
and I would I would get pick people to get pictures of me

3112
03:12:54,230 --> 03:13:05,610
and stuff and I would become a local legend that's what I
would do and then I would check I would go on like TikTok

3113
03:13:05,610 --> 03:13:16,190
and someone's just like did you see the creature of the of
the woods they're calling it the magic mint

3114
03:13:19,650 --> 03:13:27,290
well mint you're already a ghost I know that I know that but
like I want to become ghosts are everywhere right ghosts are

3115
03:13:27,290 --> 03:13:32,490
all over I want to become there's like only one There's only
one mothman.

3116
03:13:33,070 --> 03:13:39,090
I want to be I want to be the one famous thing Does this
mean anything to you?

3117
03:13:41,110 --> 03:13:41,650
Yeah,

3118
03:13:45,800 --> 03:13:51,280
I want to be the the the Jersey devil the minty the minty

3119
03:13:55,240 --> 03:14:01,380
Madman That's what I would do guys I'm lost.

3120
03:14:01,640 --> 03:14:02,610
I don't know what to

3121
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:19,860
The freaky foot Ghost of Bigfoot in a meadow

3122
03:14:26,380 --> 03:14:29,600
The Atlas name I think it is maybe something to do with the
poster

3123
03:14:45,880 --> 03:14:56,280
No, I didn't think it was that I'm just kind of picking
stuff Said it was in a book you found Yeah This is...

3124
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:58,140
But this doesn't say anything like...

3125
03:14:58,140 --> 03:15:00,180
It really doesn't say like Atlas or anything.

3126
03:15:00,320 --> 03:15:02,560
I can't even identify what some of these photos are.

3127
03:15:03,340 --> 03:15:05,120
This looks like a slot machine to me.

3128
03:15:13,200 --> 03:15:14,080
I'm lost.

3129
03:15:15,300 --> 03:15:16,520
Searching for contradictions.

3130
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:17,180
I'm trying!

3131
03:15:17,300 --> 03:15:18,920
The things that I'm trying to think of...

3132
03:15:29,780 --> 03:15:31,400
There's just so many props.

3133
03:15:44,740 --> 03:15:45,220
Wait,

3134
03:15:55,140 --> 03:15:57,320
wasn't this based at Village Hall?

3135
03:15:57,800 --> 03:15:59,760
Oh, it was, but you never came in contact?

3136
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:01,160
Ah!

3137
03:16:03,420 --> 03:16:08,220
According to the flyer, this third eye group was based at
the Village Hall.

3138
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:08,820
Is that right?

3139
03:16:09,220 --> 03:16:09,560
Was it?

3140
03:16:09,720 --> 03:16:11,120
That's where you were based, wasn't it?

3141
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:12,400
Was it?

3142
03:16:12,460 --> 03:16:17,640
Oh, you said you invented the Atlas phrase free to be free
while you were based at the Village Hall.

3143
03:16:19,580 --> 03:16:20,220
So I did.

3144
03:16:21,040 --> 03:16:24,180
So you must have come into contact with Third Eye at some
point.

3145
03:16:24,320 --> 03:16:25,560
You were using the same wall.

3146
03:16:26,180 --> 03:16:28,080
Oh, oh, he's sweating.

3147
03:16:28,320 --> 03:16:32,040
I'm afraid I haven't been entirely honest with you,
Inspector.

3148
03:16:32,220 --> 03:16:33,120
Oh, yeah, I think we know that.

3149
03:16:33,140 --> 03:16:33,660
Go on.

3150
03:16:34,700 --> 03:16:37,060
You see, Third Eye.

3151
03:16:38,020 --> 03:16:38,660
Was your pop-up?

3152
03:16:38,860 --> 03:16:43,160
Third Eye is, or was, Atlas, under a different name.

3153
03:16:43,500 --> 03:16:44,620
It really was.

3154
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,760
Atlas is, Third Eye.

3155
03:16:47,240 --> 03:16:48,960
In a new improved form, yes.

3156
03:16:49,580 --> 03:16:51,580
And you ran Third Eye.

3157
03:16:51,980 --> 03:16:52,660
With Dad, yes.

3158
03:16:53,140 --> 03:16:54,840
So you must have known Liam.

3159
03:16:55,340 --> 03:16:56,800
You didn't just meet him, did you?

3160
03:16:56,960 --> 03:16:59,380
Yes, I knew him, Inspector, but don't get your hopes up.

3161
03:16:59,520 --> 03:17:02,840
All of this has been thoroughly investigated and cleared up.

3162
03:17:03,240 --> 03:17:04,880
You've been investigated about his death?

3163
03:17:05,440 --> 03:17:06,260
They dropped the case.

3164
03:17:06,620 --> 03:17:07,940
We didn't have anything to do with it.

3165
03:17:08,080 --> 03:17:12,020
Well, when I say drop the case, I mean, a police
investigation is one thing, but what the public thinks is

3166
03:17:12,020 --> 03:17:12,320
another.

3167
03:17:12,700 --> 03:17:15,620
They threatened to go public, and then James...

3168
03:17:15,620 --> 03:17:19,080
Bloody Wilson started distributing his flyers, and that was
it.

3169
03:17:19,620 --> 03:17:20,480
No choice.

3170
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:21,800
It was an end to it.

3171
03:17:21,820 --> 03:17:23,160
You had to change the name.

3172
03:17:23,260 --> 03:17:30,560
We'd already paid the family an out-of-court settlement I
thought that was an end to it and then James and his

3173
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:30,940
cronies.

3174
03:17:31,100 --> 03:17:31,960
They wouldn't leave it alone.

3175
03:17:32,380 --> 03:17:32,920
James has cronies.

3176
03:17:33,140 --> 03:17:39,840
We had to close down Buy a new place rebrand so eventually
We reopened.

3177
03:17:39,880 --> 03:17:41,920
I'm shocked they didn't leave town.

3178
03:17:42,860 --> 03:17:44,220
Why don't you go somewhere else?

3179
03:17:44,220 --> 03:17:44,700
Until now.

3180
03:17:45,080 --> 03:17:47,120
Yes, so you knew James Wilson too.

3181
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:55,020
We knew James, but he didn't know us as such oh it was very
quick to shoot us down but he didn't do anything like

3182
03:17:55,020 --> 03:18:02,200
actually coming to the course to see what he was about so
james and then they kill someone again we're now running

3183
03:18:02,200 --> 03:18:11,820
atlas not unless he came to one of our courses and how much
of all that stuff was true ect machines brainwashing i'm

3184
03:18:11,820 --> 03:18:21,560
afraid that exists only exclusively in the mind of mr wilson
all we do is make better people we challenge their

3185
03:18:21,560 --> 03:18:29,240
prejudices and presumptions oh it's such a cult yeah the
university is here yourself a course starts in 15 minutes

3186
03:18:29,240 --> 03:18:39,140
excuse me inspector oh my god they're like yeah they get
like the vulnerable college kids I can't come back now well

3192
03:19:26,660 --> 03:19:27,020
Hello, Papa.

3193
03:19:27,420 --> 03:19:28,600
To whom do I owe the pleasure?

3194
03:19:29,300 --> 03:19:31,060
It's Detective Inspector Jenks.

3195
03:19:31,420 --> 03:19:32,840
Wow, it really looks like his dad.

3196
03:19:33,900 --> 03:19:35,520
I believe you knew Kate Vine.

3197
03:19:35,660 --> 03:19:36,580
Okay, thanks for the get there.

3198
03:19:37,940 --> 03:19:40,320
Oh, I thought all this was Delta, Inspector.

3199
03:19:40,900 --> 03:19:44,620
You do know that Kate Vine was a gherkin short of a big mat.

3200
03:19:45,440 --> 03:19:46,300
You do now.

3201
03:19:46,360 --> 03:19:50,240
You must forgive my son, Inspector.

3202
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:56,760
He still can't summon up the courage to come straight to the
point.

3203
03:19:57,480 --> 03:19:58,560
So what do you want to know?

3204
03:19:59,060 --> 03:20:01,080
Well, a few more questions if you don't mind.

3205
03:20:01,220 --> 03:20:01,920
Oh, but I do mind.

3206
03:20:02,060 --> 03:20:03,120
I'm a very busy man.

3207
03:20:03,400 --> 03:20:05,220
Try asking an intelligent question.

3208
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:12,420
Like, do I mind being quizzed about a once promising student
who turned into a useless drunk?

3209
03:20:12,760 --> 03:20:14,600
Ryan, would you mind leaving us for a while?

3210
03:20:14,820 --> 03:20:15,060
Oh.

3211
03:20:15,460 --> 03:20:16,660
I'll go back to the centre.

3212
03:20:17,240 --> 03:20:19,380
I have one or two things to prepare.

3213
03:20:21,520 --> 03:20:22,420
One of my favorite games.

3214
03:20:22,780 --> 03:20:23,900
Yeah, couple, thank you.

3215
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:24,880
Adrigo, thank you.

3216
03:20:25,460 --> 03:20:29,380
You may begin, Mr. Holmes, although I'm not going to be able
to help you.

3217
03:20:29,820 --> 03:20:35,300
I don't have much to do with the course nowadays, so I can't
give you any hard information.

3218
03:20:35,980 --> 03:20:36,780
That's as maybe.

3219
03:20:37,020 --> 03:20:37,480
But we need.

3220
03:20:37,480 --> 03:20:38,360
No, that's as is.

3221
03:20:38,760 --> 03:20:40,180
Oh my god, this guy.

3222
03:20:40,300 --> 03:20:41,440
But if you want my opinion.

3223
03:20:41,440 --> 03:20:42,560
He might be our toughest nut to crack.

3224
03:20:42,680 --> 03:20:44,680
I'd be quite happy to give it to you.

3225
03:20:45,380 --> 03:20:46,740
So, far away.

3226
03:20:47,260 --> 03:20:47,540
Okay.

3227
03:20:48,020 --> 03:20:48,580
Thank you.

3228
03:20:48,780 --> 03:20:49,580
Okay, yeah.

3229
03:20:49,580 --> 03:20:50,900
Come on, thank you!

3230
03:20:51,020 --> 03:20:53,280
Well, Paul certainly doesn't take any prisoners.

3231
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:55,620
It's obvious who's pulling the strings in this family.

3232
03:20:55,980 --> 03:21:00,020
And I wonder what they got up to in their previous guise as
third eye.

3233
03:21:01,100 --> 03:21:02,220
Eight o'clock already.

3234
03:21:02,900 --> 03:21:05,000
Don't I have until like midnight to solve this?

3235
03:21:05,880 --> 03:21:06,160
Right?

3236
03:21:06,420 --> 03:21:08,960
Alright, let's start at... Oh my gosh, we have so many
things to ask about.

3237
03:21:09,020 --> 03:21:10,040
We start at the very beginning!

3238
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:12,220
How well did you know, Kate?

3239
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:15,280
Harding you went at all.

3240
03:21:16,080 --> 03:21:17,700
I met her a few times.

3241
03:21:19,580 --> 03:21:31,080
but the cause that's about all so when was the last time you
saw her last friday so when she the day she died that's the

3242
03:21:31,080 --> 03:21:39,220
day she died was the last time speak to her then you saw her
got it it's possible and how did she seem was she happy sad

3243
03:21:39,220 --> 03:21:41,060
preoccupied she was drunk

3244
03:21:44,340 --> 03:21:49,880
kate was drunk okay okay her driver's license.

3245
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:52,240
Do you know if Kate had lost this?

3246
03:21:52,820 --> 03:21:53,820
It's her driving license.

3247
03:21:54,040 --> 03:21:54,940
Oh, I don't know that.

3248
03:21:55,240 --> 03:21:56,760
You didn't see it lying around anywhere.

3249
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:57,220
No.

3250
03:21:59,360 --> 03:22:00,800
Okay, very straight to the point.

3251
03:22:02,480 --> 03:22:03,440
The bicycle.

3252
03:22:04,180 --> 03:22:06,660
Oh my god, I can't believe we're asking about this.

3253
03:22:07,060 --> 03:22:09,680
Did you know anything about Simon Thompson's bike?

3254
03:22:10,140 --> 03:22:10,380
No.

3255
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:20,300
Honestly, I feel like that should be everybody's answer.

3256
03:22:20,820 --> 03:22:21,640
Just no.

3257
03:22:23,860 --> 03:22:25,160
I don't know.

3258
03:22:25,620 --> 03:22:26,840
I don't know about his bike.

3259
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:28,060
Ever tried Simon's finger?

3260
03:22:28,140 --> 03:22:28,720
Why aren't you asking me?

3261
03:22:28,740 --> 03:22:29,300
Simon Thompson?

3262
03:22:29,520 --> 03:22:30,040
No, I haven't.

3263
03:22:30,060 --> 03:22:35,500
I wouldn't touch anything that has had Simon's fingers in
it.

3264
03:22:36,860 --> 03:22:36,920
Ooh.

3265
03:22:38,380 --> 03:22:39,700
He doesn't like Simon?

3266
03:22:39,980 --> 03:22:41,200
That's what I'm getting from that.

3267
03:22:45,400 --> 03:22:48,060
Have you seen this before?

3268
03:22:49,640 --> 03:22:50,340
Looks familiar.

3269
03:22:50,600 --> 03:22:51,500
Where did you find it?

3270
03:22:52,080 --> 03:22:53,920
It was in the woods.

3271
03:22:54,700 --> 03:23:03,580
presumably had something to do with kate or her killer well
that's what i'm trying to establish shouldn't it be in an

3272
03:23:03,580 --> 03:23:11,340
evidence bag inspector in case of contamination i didn't
have one with me unfortunately well don't go testing it for

3273
03:23:11,340 --> 03:23:21,580
dna will you oh it's got yours all over it she speaks like
snape like how alan rickman played a snape in the movies

3274
03:23:21,580 --> 03:23:25,920
it's got your DNA all over it.

3275
03:23:28,460 --> 03:23:28,920
Dang!

3276
03:23:31,020 --> 03:23:32,880
Oh my gosh.

3277
03:23:35,480 --> 03:23:37,720
You know, it might not be Cades, right?

3278
03:23:39,540 --> 03:23:41,180
Could be the killers, huh?

3279
03:23:42,120 --> 03:23:42,400
Ask.

3280
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:44,380
What do you know about this?

3281
03:23:44,780 --> 03:23:45,860
It's a freedom necklace.

3282
03:23:46,260 --> 03:23:46,980
You hear it, right?

3283
03:23:47,080 --> 03:23:50,060
It's a symbol we use sometimes on the course.

3284
03:23:50,740 --> 03:23:52,740
Little bird in cage flying away.

3285
03:23:53,680 --> 03:23:58,760
Well, freeing themselves from their past is the analogy.

3286
03:23:59,500 --> 03:24:01,840
So do they get them when they join the course or something?

3287
03:24:02,520 --> 03:24:03,960
No, no, no, not as a rule.

3288
03:24:04,480 --> 03:24:06,620
I think I bought one once as a present.

3289
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:09,400
Oh, not for Kate by any chance?

3290
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:12,300
No, not for Kate.

3291
03:24:12,380 --> 03:24:16,920
I can't really remember who it was for, a birthday present,
maybe for one of the students.

3292
03:24:17,680 --> 03:24:18,580
Which student?

3293
03:24:18,700 --> 03:24:19,600
That's weird.

3294
03:24:19,840 --> 03:24:20,480
I have no idea.

3295
03:24:22,860 --> 03:24:23,900
That's suspicious.

3296
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:27,320
Wait, you can't un-hear it now.

3297
03:24:30,040 --> 03:24:30,920
That's weird.

3298
03:24:32,960 --> 03:24:34,800
Bought a freedom necklace for a student.

3299
03:24:36,140 --> 03:24:41,380
We know the one girl that said that she received the
necklace as an unwanted present.

3300
03:24:48,750 --> 03:24:50,290
Yeah, and you don't know who you got a gift for?

3301
03:24:50,410 --> 03:24:51,290
That's so strange.

3302
03:24:52,870 --> 03:24:53,650
It was Emma, right?

3303
03:24:53,730 --> 03:24:55,830
It was, it was.

3304
03:24:57,850 --> 03:24:58,290
Very...

3305
03:25:00,250 --> 03:25:09,430
very interesting what do you know about this looks like a
mask you don't recognize it not particularly looks like a

3306
03:25:09,430 --> 03:25:20,290
monarch mask monarch mask what's a monarch mask monarch is a
fancy dress outfit is what Ryan goes there sometimes what

3307
03:25:20,290 --> 03:25:27,290
why would a fancy dress please have a creepy mask thinks
mask is from Monarch Costumes.

3308
03:25:28,170 --> 03:25:29,870
Ryan uses the shop.

3309
03:25:30,070 --> 03:25:30,270
What?

3310
03:25:31,910 --> 03:25:33,910
Fancy dress equals costume.

3311
03:25:34,790 --> 03:25:35,830
Oh, okay.

3312
03:25:37,850 --> 03:25:39,690
Could you tell me a bit about this?

3313
03:25:40,230 --> 03:25:42,030
How did it designed by an agency?

3314
03:25:42,370 --> 03:25:43,450
Why does everybody say that?

3315
03:25:43,570 --> 03:25:44,230
When was that?

3316
03:25:44,450 --> 03:25:45,070
Last year.

3317
03:25:45,610 --> 03:25:46,670
Is that when you started the business?

3318
03:25:48,110 --> 03:25:49,170
Yes, I suppose so.

3319
03:25:51,790 --> 03:25:53,410
Poster designed by an agency.

3320
03:25:55,430 --> 03:25:55,830
Like, Why?

3321
03:25:56,170 --> 03:25:59,670
I don't understand why the poster being designed by an
agency is so important.

3322
03:26:01,110 --> 03:26:02,030
I skipped the pub window.

3323
03:26:02,250 --> 03:26:03,850
You can't ask about the pub window.

3324
03:26:08,360 --> 03:26:10,880
Have you ever seen one of these before?

3325
03:26:11,500 --> 03:26:14,400
I believe it's a scrying mirror.

3326
03:26:14,440 --> 03:26:16,040
How does everybody know what this is?

3327
03:26:16,180 --> 03:26:16,760
Have I used one?

3328
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:20,100
Why would I use a scrying mirror?

3329
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:21,260
I don't know.

3330
03:26:21,360 --> 03:26:22,600
You know what it is, though.

3331
03:26:22,720 --> 03:26:23,360
You know what it is.

3332
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:24,100
Sort of thing.

3333
03:26:24,360 --> 03:26:24,600
No.

3334
03:26:25,480 --> 03:26:27,660
Does the Atlas course use them at all?

3335
03:26:27,960 --> 03:26:28,800
Not at all.

3336
03:26:30,540 --> 03:26:31,260
Strange question.

3337
03:26:34,040 --> 03:26:35,860
Why would you know what it is then?

3338
03:26:36,040 --> 03:26:36,960
If you...

3339
03:26:39,720 --> 03:26:40,760
If you...

3340
03:26:40,760 --> 03:26:41,880
If you...

3341
03:26:42,580 --> 03:26:43,620
Don't know.

3342
03:26:44,460 --> 03:26:45,280
Or don't use it.

3343
03:26:46,160 --> 03:26:48,880
What did you hear about an argument in the pub last Friday?

3344
03:26:50,940 --> 03:26:53,120
I didn't hear anything about an argument in the pub.

3345
03:26:53,220 --> 03:26:53,900
Should I have?

3346
03:26:54,160 --> 03:26:55,280
No, that's fine.

3347
03:26:56,880 --> 03:26:57,940
I feel like his...

3348
03:26:57,960 --> 03:27:09,460
actor is too good he's not giving me anything do you know
about salvia know what this is by any chance i have no idea

3349
03:27:09,460 --> 03:27:17,060
gardening isn't my kind of thing rebecca would probably know
i presume you've met rebecca yes i am sure she'd enjoy

3350
03:27:17,060 --> 03:27:25,680
telling you what it is she's the kind of woman who likes to
feel superior would probably marry a millionaire and then

3351
03:27:25,680 --> 03:27:29,380
decide to run her own pub How was that?

3352
03:27:30,300 --> 03:27:33,220
Well, she isn't exactly a housewife material.

3353
03:27:34,620 --> 03:27:36,940
She likes to be in control, like Maya.

3354
03:27:38,320 --> 03:27:42,860
Shame, isn't it, that I'm in control of both of them?

3355
03:27:43,340 --> 03:27:44,080
Freaky!

3356
03:27:47,060 --> 03:27:50,780
Oh, dang.

3357
03:27:52,300 --> 03:27:55,280
I wonder if someone's not a big fan of hers.

3358
03:27:56,720 --> 03:27:57,460
Okay.

3359
03:27:58,680 --> 03:28:02,500
Have you ever heard of Salvia Divinorum or Magic Mint?

3360
03:28:03,780 --> 03:28:05,020
Sounds like it might be a drug.

3361
03:28:05,720 --> 03:28:07,500
It's a hallucinogenic plant.

3362
03:28:08,100 --> 03:28:09,180
Legal is a matter of fact.

3363
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:12,600
I'm not a drug taker, Inspector.

3364
03:28:13,640 --> 03:28:18,700
I have no enthusiasm for voluntarily poisoning your brain.

3365
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:22,460
And you've never seen anyone on the course taking it.

3366
03:28:22,540 --> 03:28:26,720
Well, if someone heard they wouldn't have done it openly.

3367
03:28:27,960 --> 03:28:30,440
We don't allow drugs or alcohol in our course.

3368
03:28:30,880 --> 03:28:34,740
We like to tell students that success is the best drug.

3369
03:28:34,740 --> 03:28:36,340
Success is the best drug.

3370
03:28:36,820 --> 03:28:38,100
Anime is my anti-drug.

3371
03:28:38,120 --> 03:28:38,640
It's another matter.

3372
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:43,160
Okay.

3373
03:28:45,260 --> 03:28:46,860
Have you ever heard of Maid Mint?

3374
03:28:49,080 --> 03:28:51,880
Please, please don't put me in the plastic bag.

3375
03:28:53,400 --> 03:28:56,720
If I did this, would it mean anything to you?

3376
03:28:57,960 --> 03:29:06,440
an atlas student doing that oh you know so this is an atlas
thing well it wasn't exactly our idea the students started

3377
03:29:06,440 --> 03:29:16,640
doing it spontaneously to show commitment to the course cute
really which student did you see doing that i'm not sure was

3378
03:29:16,640 --> 03:29:23,880
his name kyle but he was carving it into a tree i told him
to stop did you really why up defacing public property

3379
03:29:23,880 --> 03:29:33,820
that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard what's the
punishment for that kind of thing nowadays prison sentence

3380
03:29:33,820 --> 03:29:42,460
oh it's usually a fine all right what about defiling public
liberty does that carry a fine too oh dear enough the

3381
03:29:42,460 --> 03:29:49,340
student in question argued a similar point is that something
you encourage on the atlas course we encourage people who

3382
03:29:49,340 --> 03:30:00,340
put ideas first and moral anachronisms second oh my god the
problem with the law inspector oh my gosh out of date well i

3383
03:30:00,340 --> 03:30:07,700
suppose that's a matter of opinion however you still respect
it respect it this guy acted in old british tv that's

3384
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:21,260
awesome we all play by the book inspector but that's only
because of the threat of possible incarceration oh my god oh

3385
03:30:21,260 --> 03:30:31,420
my god at the phrase can you tell me a little about the
atlas phrase free to be free where did you hear that i was

3386
03:30:31,420 --> 03:30:42,200
talking to one of your students it's a little phrase we
conjured up to summarize our objectives what is your

3387
03:30:42,200 --> 03:30:52,400
objective if you don't mind me asking making money on the
course the objective of the course is to free people from

3388
03:30:52,400 --> 03:31:01,160
bondage We teach that most people are crippled by their
past, by guilt, their attitudes, their beliefs, all that

3389
03:31:01,160 --> 03:31:01,560
kind of stuff.

3390
03:31:01,800 --> 03:31:03,000
Money, money, money.

3391
03:31:03,820 --> 03:31:04,560
Griples people.

3392
03:31:05,540 --> 03:31:10,940
Feeling guilty in business is like a meat eater feeling
guilty in an abattoir.

3393
03:31:11,640 --> 03:31:15,900
Guilt comes from the archaic emotional centers of the brain.

3394
03:31:16,520 --> 03:31:19,800
It's a vestige of our animal ancestry, and that's all.

3395
03:31:19,860 --> 03:31:20,440
Only you.

3396
03:31:20,500 --> 03:31:21,200
In business.

3397
03:31:21,900 --> 03:31:23,140
You heed it at your peril.

3398
03:31:23,300 --> 03:31:25,700
Only cave people feel guilty.

3399
03:31:25,960 --> 03:31:26,080
What the?

3400
03:31:26,240 --> 03:31:27,320
I'm sorry, Inspector.

3401
03:31:27,740 --> 03:31:29,240
My house appears to be haunted.

3402
03:31:30,400 --> 03:31:31,540
Do you mind closing the door?

3403
03:31:35,540 --> 03:31:37,320
I'm just saying it's so casually.

3404
03:31:38,040 --> 03:31:39,840
Guilt has no place in business.

3405
03:31:40,320 --> 03:31:40,940
None at all.

3406
03:31:41,320 --> 03:31:44,540
I have few beliefs, Inspector, but that's one of them.

3407
03:31:45,180 --> 03:31:48,440
And what if you have done something wrong?

3408
03:31:48,960 --> 03:31:50,100
Well, that's the whole point.

3409
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:52,560
Guilt has nothing to do with it.

3410
03:31:53,300 --> 03:32:10,300
interesting opinion oh mint cameo magic mint magic mint this
guy is so scary he creeps me out he's so scary how well did

3411
03:32:10,300 --> 03:32:22,300
you know Liam who Liam who took his life oh well as far as I
remember it was a good student confident that guy you didn't

3412
03:32:22,300 --> 03:32:30,780
notice any problems I believe he had problems at home were
you there when he died yes what and afterwards you didn't

3413
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:40,100
see him after the meeting no wait what was he like there
when he died apart from being drunk or possibly because of

3414
03:32:40,100 --> 03:32:47,140
that he seemed perfectly happy he was drunk well I assumed
the bottle in his hand contained whiskey and not lemonade

3415
03:32:47,140 --> 03:32:53,980
lots of similarities to Kate don't you think drinking
depression is that normal for the students people come into

3416
03:32:53,980 --> 03:33:01,520
the Atlas course for quick solutions to their problems and
when they don't get them as quickly as they might have liked

3417
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:14,580
sometimes their impatience gets the better I thought this
was a business course I'm not being business enough the

3418
03:33:14,580 --> 03:33:23,840
business is not coming fast enough Oh, wait.

3419
03:33:26,660 --> 03:33:27,900
Yeah, funny business.

3420
03:33:28,080 --> 03:33:31,120
This is some real funny business going on in here.

3421
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:33,420
Okay, finally, one last thing.

3422
03:33:33,440 --> 03:33:35,300
What do you know about this?

3423
03:33:36,480 --> 03:33:40,560
So you've been graced with Gerbal's company already, have
you?

3424
03:33:41,240 --> 03:33:44,960
James, our local minister for propaganda.

3425
03:33:45,340 --> 03:33:45,880
Propaganda.

3426
03:33:45,880 --> 03:33:50,720
I suppose Ryan already told you about our actual previous
incarnation.

3427
03:33:51,060 --> 03:33:51,340
Yes.

3428
03:33:51,380 --> 03:33:51,940
He explained.

3429
03:33:52,040 --> 03:34:02,780
yes did he tell you anything scandalous unless you count the
suicide well these things happened was it your idea the

3430
03:34:02,780 --> 03:34:12,140
suicide third eye yeah i suppose it was as my son had
started to act deal with salesmen this isn't an accurate

3431
03:34:12,140 --> 03:34:21,320
scary or to give him something to do and third eye was the
same as atlas teaching business skills very similar so

3432
03:34:21,320 --> 03:34:24,240
liam's Didn't prompt you to make any changes?

3433
03:34:24,740 --> 03:34:26,920
There was nothing we could do about Liam's death, Inspector.

3434
03:34:27,500 --> 03:34:30,740
Any more than we could do anything about Kate's, it was out
of our control.

3435
03:34:31,220 --> 03:34:32,700
You can't blame me for wondering, Paul.

3436
03:34:32,940 --> 03:34:34,640
Two student deaths and two years.

3437
03:34:35,060 --> 03:34:36,780
It's called a coincidence, Inspector.

3438
03:34:37,740 --> 03:34:40,100
I expect they had fast food also.

3439
03:34:41,260 --> 03:34:45,180
But you're not investigating all the local chippies, are
you?

3440
03:34:45,840 --> 03:34:47,180
No, that's so different.

3441
03:34:48,320 --> 03:34:48,800
What?

3442
03:34:51,360 --> 03:34:51,840
Oh.

3443
03:34:52,040 --> 03:34:54,140
Wow, we...

3444
03:34:54,140 --> 03:34:54,920
Chippies.

3445
03:34:55,460 --> 03:34:57,360
Oh, gosh.

3446
03:34:59,800 --> 03:35:01,380
What is Chippies?

3447
03:35:03,060 --> 03:35:05,480
Fish and chips are the number one killer in the UK.

3448
03:35:06,000 --> 03:35:07,400
All that cholesterol, baby.

3449
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:09,600
Wow.

3450
03:35:10,040 --> 03:35:11,240
I'm hungry, actually.

3451
03:35:12,760 --> 03:35:13,820
I'm kind of hungry.

3452
03:35:15,720 --> 03:35:17,020
Oh my gosh.

3453
03:35:17,980 --> 03:35:19,300
British fast food.

3454
03:35:19,420 --> 03:35:21,380
Ask Vicky, I'm gonna say, what's a Chippies?

3455
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:24,320
it's the number one killer in the uk

3456
03:35:28,060 --> 03:35:34,500

3460
03:35:55,400 --> 03:35:57,160
Met the villain, left.

3461
03:36:00,660 --> 03:36:02,420
Please, Chief, I'm scared.

3462
03:36:03,420 --> 03:36:04,340
Chief, Chief!

3463
03:36:06,840 --> 03:36:08,780
This game has such a trip, it's so funny.

3464
03:36:09,800 --> 03:36:12,180
Chief, lots of new information for you.

3465
03:36:12,440 --> 03:36:12,960
Chief!

3466
03:36:14,600 --> 03:36:16,560
You know that cult I was telling you about?

3467
03:36:17,120 --> 03:36:19,720
Well, it turns out it was Atlas all along.

3468
03:36:19,920 --> 03:36:21,020
They were the same thing.

3469
03:36:22,040 --> 03:36:23,140
And the student...

3470
03:36:23,140 --> 03:36:24,420
How did you know that?

3471
03:36:24,500 --> 03:36:25,800
It was pretty obvious, Jakes.

3472
03:36:26,460 --> 03:36:29,980
Well, the student who died last year, Liam, was a student
there.

3473
03:36:30,200 --> 03:36:34,200
They had to change their name after he died and were forced
into an out-of-court settlement with the family.

3474
03:36:34,380 --> 03:36:34,980
Hi, Doug.

3475
03:36:35,460 --> 03:36:37,620
Allsar met Paul Rand, finally.

3476
03:36:38,400 --> 03:36:39,340
He's worse than Ryan.

3477
03:36:39,560 --> 03:36:40,720
Doesn't give a straight answer to anything.

3478
03:36:40,820 --> 03:36:41,860
What did he say about Liam?

3479
03:36:42,100 --> 03:36:44,640
Not much other than that he was drinking throughout the
course.

3480
03:36:45,100 --> 03:36:46,280
But you're not allowed to have it.

3481
03:36:47,800 --> 03:36:48,940
You're not allowed to have alcohol.

3482
03:36:49,780 --> 03:36:50,640
Push him some more.

3483
03:36:51,140 --> 03:36:52,020
See what you can get at.

3484
03:36:52,040 --> 03:37:04,720
yes sir thanks chief did he just say bye-z-bye bye-z-bye
bye-bye everybody's so nonchalant in this game it's crazy oh

3485
03:37:04,720 --> 03:37:21,320
bye-z-bye oh random oh my gosh wait is that an audi he's
also an audi driver oh no wonder he's the worst

3486
03:37:25,880 --> 03:37:27,440
Ah, man.

3487
03:37:32,240 --> 03:37:34,600
It explains so much.

3488
03:37:38,340 --> 03:37:40,480
Ask you a couple more things, please.

3489
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:42,960
That is a random car.

3490
03:37:46,100 --> 03:37:47,600
He's our guy.

3491
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:51,580
Oh, totally guilty for just that alone.

3492
03:37:52,040 --> 03:37:52,600
Yeah, yeah.

3493
03:37:54,260 --> 03:37:56,460
Audi drivers, they're just always so bad.

3494
03:37:56,880 --> 03:37:57,260
Yeah.

3495
03:38:07,090 --> 03:38:07,530
Okay.

3496
03:38:09,850 --> 03:38:12,350
Anyway, we gotta press this guy for something.

3497
03:38:17,630 --> 03:38:19,550
It's funny, though, because you'll hear somebody say...

3498
03:38:19,550 --> 03:38:23,870
You'll hear people say that about, like, almost any driver
or any car, you know.

3499
03:38:25,290 --> 03:38:31,250
But anytime I see someone being, like, a stupid jerk on the
road, that's always an Audi driver.

3500
03:38:32,870 --> 03:38:34,390
Oh, anyway.

3501
03:38:36,550 --> 03:38:38,950
And it just solidifies my thing even more.

3502
03:38:40,730 --> 03:38:42,830
Okay, this guy is literally the final boss.

3503
03:38:42,990 --> 03:38:45,110
We have, like, so much stuff we can question him on.

3504
03:38:46,470 --> 03:38:48,450
Third eye is Paul's idea.

3505
03:38:51,430 --> 03:38:52,810
Third eye, very similar to Atlas.

3506
03:38:53,010 --> 03:38:54,710
Liam's death was unavoidable.

3507
03:38:58,720 --> 03:39:02,240
Are we sure it was unavoidable if we knew that he was having
personal problems?

3508
03:39:09,210 --> 03:39:11,570
Good thing I have my cute little meada.

3509
03:39:14,870 --> 03:39:18,670
Which brand is the most common with problem drivers depends
on where you are.

3510
03:39:18,810 --> 03:39:19,830
I guess maybe, right?

3511
03:39:21,230 --> 03:39:23,650
There's an entitlement that comes with having an expensive
car.

3512
03:39:23,950 --> 03:39:25,050
I think that's it, though, right?

3513
03:39:25,070 --> 03:39:29,130
Because I think they're like, I'm in my expensive car and I
own the road.

3514
03:39:30,410 --> 03:39:31,310
Get out of here!

3515
03:39:32,310 --> 03:39:34,010
The road is for everybody!

3516
03:39:37,190 --> 03:39:37,790
Okay.

3517
03:39:38,590 --> 03:39:41,750
It was at Atlas the night Eliam died.

3518
03:39:42,210 --> 03:39:43,690
Didn't see Eliam after the course.

3519
03:39:44,230 --> 03:39:45,910
Had been drinking all night at the seminar.

3520
03:39:46,130 --> 03:39:48,010
But you don't allow...

3521
03:39:48,710 --> 03:39:50,010
You don't allow...

3522
03:39:52,210 --> 03:39:52,810
Uh...

3523
03:39:53,950 --> 03:39:55,150
Alcohol, no?

3524
03:39:57,990 --> 03:40:00,150
Doesn't know about Simon's.

3525
03:40:08,500 --> 03:40:09,700
I was...

3526
03:40:09,720 --> 03:40:11,720
I wish we could ask him if he knows...

3527
03:40:12,300 --> 03:40:12,740
Emma.

3528
03:40:20,000 --> 03:40:22,140
I wanna go to Monarch Costumes.

3529
03:40:22,340 --> 03:40:23,640
What is this place?

3530
03:40:27,150 --> 03:40:28,970
Business started last year.

3531
03:40:39,820 --> 03:40:43,480
I like it's like possibly spoke to her, but you knew she was
drunk?

3532
03:40:45,180 --> 03:40:45,520
How?

3533
03:40:45,700 --> 03:40:48,940
How would you know that she's drunk if you...

3534
03:40:49,180 --> 03:40:50,740
Possibly only spoke to her.

3535
03:40:54,380 --> 03:40:56,120
It doesn't say that he doesn't know the pendant.

3536
03:40:56,460 --> 03:40:59,000
It says that he says it looks familiar.

3537
03:40:59,880 --> 03:41:00,920
I mean, we could try that, though.

3538
03:41:01,060 --> 03:41:03,100
It looks familiar, but you bought it.

3539
03:41:04,420 --> 03:41:04,880
No.

3540
03:41:07,620 --> 03:41:09,220
Yeah, like he...

3541
03:41:09,220 --> 03:41:12,120
It's kind of awkward, I guess, that one.

3542
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:14,980
Never used a scrying mirror.

3543
03:41:15,140 --> 03:41:16,360
No interest in scrying.

3544
03:41:16,620 --> 03:41:18,940
I have no interest in scrying.

3545
03:41:19,180 --> 03:41:21,480
I've never scrying before.

3546
03:41:22,160 --> 03:41:23,860
Alice doesn't use scrying on the course.

3547
03:41:24,540 --> 03:41:25,780
Kids' argument.

3548
03:41:26,300 --> 03:41:27,540
I don't care about it.

3549
03:41:28,900 --> 03:41:30,380
Gardening is not his thing.

3550
03:41:35,150 --> 03:41:36,210
Familiar but use it on the course?

3551
03:41:36,370 --> 03:41:37,250
We could try that.

3552
03:41:39,030 --> 03:41:40,670
Use it on the course.

3553
03:41:41,830 --> 03:41:42,590
Looks familiar.

3554
03:41:51,220 --> 03:41:53,840
Alice encourages ideas over morality.

3555
03:41:57,040 --> 03:41:59,460
reluctantly abides by the law.

3556
03:42:00,480 --> 03:42:02,940
I reluctantly abide by the law.

3557
03:42:03,220 --> 03:42:05,080
It's such a funny phrase.

3558
03:42:08,710 --> 03:42:11,510
I abide by the law, but I'm really reluctant about it.

3559
03:42:13,990 --> 03:42:16,170
I think the drug one had something about...

3560
03:42:16,170 --> 03:42:16,730
Oh, let's see.

3561
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:18,490
Oh, yes, there we go.

3562
03:42:18,550 --> 03:42:19,670
Alice said, thank you, thank you.

3563
03:42:19,790 --> 03:42:19,970
Okay.

3564
03:42:21,950 --> 03:42:24,070
He had been drinking all night at the seminar.

3565
03:42:25,370 --> 03:42:37,710
So if you don't allow drink or drugs onto the site, to drink
whiskey all night well yeah we did give him various warnings

3566
03:42:37,710 --> 03:42:47,170
did try to stop him but it didn't work but you let him stay
on the course yeah well we couldn't throw him out this isn't

3567
03:42:47,170 --> 03:42:54,670
a primary school inspector we're not the police we can't
enforce these rules we want to keep taking his money fees

3568
03:42:54,670 --> 03:43:01,290
they're entitled to stay on the course and what if they want
to take drugs As long as they do it with discretion,

3569
03:43:02,210 --> 03:43:10,270
frankly, I don't care if they want to wipe or inject paint
stripper all over their faces.

3570
03:43:10,430 --> 03:43:11,010
Oh my god.

3571
03:43:11,110 --> 03:43:12,930
As long as we get their money, baby.

3572
03:43:13,370 --> 03:43:13,550
No.

3573
03:43:14,250 --> 03:43:15,430
Is there a kitchen?

3574
03:43:16,050 --> 03:43:17,970
Why do you want to go down there and check?

3575
03:43:18,470 --> 03:43:21,090
Well, obviously you wouldn't mind if what you're saying is
true.

3576
03:43:21,470 --> 03:43:22,490
Of course I wouldn't mind.

3577
03:43:23,290 --> 03:43:28,110
It's past the laboratories down the corridor, but you won't
find any drugs in there or alcohol.

3578
03:43:29,330 --> 03:43:35,550
son's office that's where I found them I find alcohol at
Atlas or not it probably isn't particularly relevant but

3579
03:43:35,550 --> 03:43:52,730
it's worth a look anyway it's literally okay thank you thank
you bye-bye it's literally in Ryan's office what okay Ryan

Sorry, Ryan, there's a few more questions I have to ask you

03:45:59,880 --> 03:46:01,300

Don't wash it.

3623
03:46:35,680 --> 03:46:35,860
Don't wash it.

3624
03:46:35,860 --> 03:46:36,560
Don't wash it.

3631
03:46:52,160 --> 03:46:53,300
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

3632
03:46:54,540 --> 03:46:54,960

This is the creepiest.

3639
03:47:16,960 --> 03:47:17,900
This is so creepy.

3640
03:47:18,920 --> 03:47:20,840
I think I'm gonna get cursed.

Atlas fake clapping

3644
03:48:06,020 --> 03:48:15,720
freedom true freedom means freedom from many vices that
society has traditionally believed to be virtues

3645
03:48:15,720 --> 03:48:30,040
self-criticism self-doubt guilt ladies and gentlemen these
are not virtues these are sins sins of the father of a fake

3646
03:48:30,040 --> 03:48:36,560
morality implanted deep within our minds and collective
consciousness by governments and religions through the ages

3647
03:48:36,560 --> 03:48:46,420
with the sole purpose of preventing the mass stopping us
from achieving the same success, happiness, and freedom

3648
03:48:46,420 --> 03:48:49,280
enjoyed by those at the very pinnacle of society.

3649
03:48:50,880 --> 03:48:52,940
I'm sorry, somebody joined this and didn't think it was a
cult.

3650
03:48:53,440 --> 03:49:02,760
I'm going to show you that common morality is nothing more
than the cynical creation of an elite desperate to stay in

3651
03:49:02,760 --> 03:49:03,100
power.

3652
03:49:04,140 --> 03:49:08,920
An elite hell-bent on preventing you from reaching your full
potential.

3653
03:49:09,360 --> 03:49:22,520
by making you feel guilty for pursuing success but the good
news is that you can take back control you can become the

So stinking funny.

3671
03:50:21,790 --> 03:50:22,910
Oh, wow.

3672
03:50:23,150 --> 03:50:27,330
Wait, I thought you said you don't keep medicine in this
establishment.

3673
03:50:27,610 --> 03:50:28,090
Oh, my God.

3674
03:50:28,170 --> 03:50:29,470

03:50:35,530 --> 03:50:37,570
Wait, it's so cute.

3678
03:50:43,390 --> 03:50:45,030
Suspicious XXX DVD.

3679
03:50:46,310 --> 03:50:46,570
Dollbird.

3680
03:50:46,830 --> 03:50:49,530
Okay, this is so funny.

3681
03:50:50,770 --> 03:50:52,290
Oh my god.

3682
03:50:53,530 --> 03:50:55,090
Yeah, and they blocked off that door.

3683
03:50:55,770 --> 03:50:56,810
So strange.

3684
03:50:59,550 --> 03:51:04,370
I think, uh, yeah, I think Ryan's back in his room now.

3685
03:51:05,690 --> 03:51:06,530
Spaghetti doll.

3686
03:51:06,850 --> 03:51:07,190
Yummy.

3687
03:51:07,570 --> 03:51:08,670
Oh my gosh, I want some spaghetti.

3688
03:51:09,430 --> 03:51:10,430
Maybe that's what I'll make.

3689
03:51:11,410 --> 03:51:11,590
Spaghetti.

3690
03:51:13,270 --> 03:51:14,130
What time is it?

3691
03:51:14,270 --> 03:51:15,570
Oh yeah, I have time to make spaghetti.

3692
03:51:16,570 --> 03:51:16,870
Nice.

3693
03:51:17,130 --> 03:51:19,650
Or, is somebody eating spaghetti tonight?

3694
03:51:19,790 --> 03:51:20,350
Can I come over?

3695
03:51:20,510 --> 03:51:21,230
Can I possess you?

3696
03:51:21,550 --> 03:51:22,350
Can I eat your spaghetti?

3697
03:51:24,330 --> 03:51:27,070
The way they grab the discs makes me...

3698
03:51:27,070 --> 03:51:30,130
It gives me powerful fight or flight.

3699
03:51:30,370 --> 03:51:31,050
They are dangerous.

3700
03:51:32,750 --> 03:51:33,210
Spaghetti.

3701
03:51:35,190 --> 03:51:35,630
Ah.

3702
03:51:38,730 --> 03:51:43,710
Let's go talk to Simon and ask if he knows about burning
dolls.

3703
03:51:46,070 --> 03:51:47,570
Wait, what is this?

3704
03:51:53,280 --> 03:51:55,340
Never mind, we're not going to Simon.

3705
03:51:55,720 --> 03:51:57,480
We're going to go into their garage.

3706
03:51:59,760 --> 03:52:00,580
Let's go!

3707
03:52:03,620 --> 03:52:05,160
Remote control lock.

3708
03:52:10,260 --> 03:52:12,560
It looks like it would open up their garage door, no?

3709
03:52:15,000 --> 03:52:23,180
back to the woods unlock to what have we seen anything that
we couldn't open yet I don't think so

3710
03:52:29,260 --> 03:52:35,900
Simon I I need to know questions if you don't mind I really
need to know what you're doing in this have you seen this

3711
03:52:35,900 --> 03:52:44,460
before what business have you learned I'm sorry what
business techniques have you learned in this place now

3712
03:52:44,460 --> 03:52:49,280
please tell me What do you know about door burning?

3713
03:52:49,660 --> 03:52:50,360
Not on the course.

3714
03:52:51,300 --> 03:52:52,460
It's a ritual thing.

3715
03:52:52,720 --> 03:52:56,340
It's getting rid of things that you don't need.

3716
03:52:56,620 --> 03:52:57,540
Throw it into the fire.

3717
03:52:57,900 --> 03:52:58,580
And that's a good thing.

3718
03:52:59,100 --> 03:53:01,800
Well, yeah, it helps you getting rid of things you don't
need.

3719
03:53:01,860 --> 03:53:03,720
So you can move on and take control again.

3720
03:53:04,540 --> 03:53:05,440
It's one of the masks for.

3721
03:53:06,220 --> 03:53:08,500
They're just to help you get into the right frame of mind.

3722
03:53:09,580 --> 03:53:12,140
Just get you into the zone, you know, help with the trans.

3723
03:53:12,460 --> 03:53:13,080
The trans!

3724
03:53:13,600 --> 03:53:14,340
Yeah, yeah.

3725
03:53:14,620 --> 03:53:15,420
It's like...

3726
03:53:15,420 --> 03:53:15,840
Mind control.

3727
03:53:16,900 --> 03:53:18,540
We do it on the course sometimes.

3728
03:53:18,720 --> 03:53:21,100
It's just to help you get into the right frame of mind, you
know.

3729
03:53:21,900 --> 03:53:24,740
So you hypnotize yourself.

3730
03:53:25,220 --> 03:53:25,840
Ask a lot.

3731
03:53:25,980 --> 03:53:27,040
How do you do that?

3732
03:53:27,320 --> 03:53:33,320
Just stare into a mirror and chant something, you know, just
say the same thing over and over again.

3733
03:53:34,640 --> 03:53:37,160
Or you could just close your eyes and put yourself into a
trance.

3734
03:53:37,300 --> 03:53:38,080
Some people can do that.

3735
03:53:38,680 --> 03:53:39,700
And that's safe?

3736
03:53:40,120 --> 03:53:40,580
Well, yeah.

3737
03:53:41,180 --> 03:53:43,640
Hypnosis doesn't work the way that most people think it
does.

3738
03:53:44,340 --> 03:53:46,840
You can't just be hypnotized if you don't want to be
hypnotized.

3739
03:53:46,860 --> 03:53:50,980
hypnotized, but you can learn to hypnotize yourself.

3740
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:51,560
I've seen that.

3741
03:53:51,860 --> 03:53:52,180
What do you say?

3742
03:53:52,200 --> 03:53:53,620
It's called auto-hypnosis.

3743
03:53:54,100 --> 03:53:57,580
Self-hypnosis, auto-hypnosis, same thing really.

3744
03:53:57,800 --> 03:53:58,480
A mirror?

3745
03:53:59,100 --> 03:53:59,520
Like a...

3746
03:53:59,520 --> 03:54:03,420
Simon was a bit too quick to play down the role of
auto-hypnosis on the course.

3747
03:54:03,940 --> 03:54:06,020
I have to ask around about this.

3748
03:54:07,800 --> 03:54:08,480
Oh, yes.

3749
03:54:08,620 --> 03:54:10,260
The Atlas auto-hypnosis.

3750
03:54:13,180 --> 03:54:15,060
The doodles are killing me.

3751
03:54:17,520 --> 03:54:20,880
Oh, he's so goofy.

3752
03:54:22,480 --> 03:54:23,820
Oh, my gosh.

3753
03:54:24,960 --> 03:54:26,280
Wait, so.

3754
03:54:28,580 --> 03:54:31,220
The masks help you with the trance.

3755
03:54:33,100 --> 03:54:35,400
Auto-hypnosis induced by using a mirror.

3756
03:54:39,800 --> 03:54:40,160
Huh.

3757
03:54:42,020 --> 03:54:46,380
If I were to do this, would it mean anything to do?

3758
03:54:46,700 --> 03:54:48,080
Yeah, the finger guns.

3759
03:54:49,280 --> 03:54:57,060
to me sending my first of all ever to say how happy i am to
have gone on the dinosaur ride one last time today i was

3760
03:54:57,060 --> 03:55:05,440
thinking of you the whole time and yes i did buy the time
rover revoke a jolt car get her i'm so jealous and so happy

3761
03:55:05,440 --> 03:55:12,760
for you too how long were the lot was the line for you i've
seen that the lines have been getting into like the 70 80 90

3762
03:55:12,760 --> 03:55:19,680
minutes and you made it why would anyone join a cult anyway
two months.

3763
03:55:26,100 --> 03:55:28,480
Did you see the video they posted?

3764
03:55:29,400 --> 03:55:29,900
Who posted?

3765
03:55:32,100 --> 03:55:33,660
He made it.

3766
03:55:34,580 --> 03:55:38,340
They thought you weren't gonna make it, but you made it.

3767
03:55:39,080 --> 03:55:47,140
It's really funny because, like, the queue for the wait for
dinosaur is so long that people are seeing parts of the

3768
03:55:47,140 --> 03:55:48,700
queue that they've never seen before.

3769
03:55:49,960 --> 03:55:54,000
They're like, wow, I didn't even know that, like, this part,
this area existed.

3770
03:55:55,640 --> 03:55:59,480
There's, like, cute little, like, dinosaur statues and stuff
around.

3771
03:55:59,740 --> 03:56:00,680
It's so awesome.

3772
03:56:02,620 --> 03:56:05,660
It was 75 minutes consistently, but I had lightning laying.

3773
03:56:07,380 --> 03:56:09,320
Tomorrow's the last day, you guys.

3774
03:56:10,320 --> 03:56:12,520
That dinosaur, like, you can ride dinosaur.

3775
03:56:15,000 --> 03:56:15,980
That's so sad.

3776
03:56:16,900 --> 03:56:18,080
Tomorrow's the last day.

3777
03:56:18,200 --> 03:56:18,740
It's open.

3778
03:56:19,860 --> 03:56:22,340
Come February 2nd, it will be gone.

3779
03:56:25,280 --> 03:56:27,620
Maranera and cheese, a perfect blend of me.

3780
03:56:29,200 --> 03:56:30,500
Hope made spaghetti is doing well.

3781
03:56:36,150 --> 03:56:42,010
I can't believe they're getting rid of dinosaur and they're
going to replace it with an incanto dark ride.

3782
03:56:42,150 --> 03:56:46,070
Why do we need another freaking slow boat dark ride?

3783
03:56:46,270 --> 03:56:47,490
I'm losing my mind.

3784
03:56:47,690 --> 03:56:48,590
I can't do it.

3785
03:56:48,770 --> 03:56:50,310
I don't want another dark ride.

3786
03:56:51,190 --> 03:56:56,510
That makes several dark rides at Animal Kingdom.

3787
03:56:57,030 --> 03:56:58,470
Actually, I think there's just the one.

3788
03:56:58,690 --> 03:56:59,030
Wait, is it?

3789
03:56:59,050 --> 03:56:59,610
Hold on.

3790
03:57:00,550 --> 03:57:02,510
But still, Disney has so many dark rides.

3791
03:57:02,870 --> 03:57:05,210
They're slow and they're boring and like...

3792
03:57:05,730 --> 03:57:06,550
Sorry, anyway.

3793
03:57:09,570 --> 03:57:11,850
Do people like dark rides that much?

3794
03:57:12,290 --> 03:57:18,950
You would be surprised, actually, at how many people dislike
bigger thrill rides.

3795
03:57:19,470 --> 03:57:20,690
I think that's the main thing.

3796
03:57:21,030 --> 03:57:31,630
A lot of people like dark rides because, one, you get to sit
for a longer amount of time because you are walking around

3797
03:57:31,630 --> 03:57:36,630
in the park a lot, and you get to sit and it's nice and cool
in there and stuff like that.

3798
03:57:38,390 --> 03:57:44,050
It's just, you know, I'm a big fan of fun, fun action rides
and stuff like that, you know?

3799
03:57:44,150 --> 03:57:51,010
I love, and don't get me wrong, like I can appreciate a dark
ride, like, uh, I like those two.

3800
03:57:51,030 --> 03:57:59,910
but like having only dark rides like that are like boat that
you sit in a boat and you just travel along and it's very

3801
03:57:59,910 --> 03:58:14,140
slow like it's it's a small world is voted as the comfiest
ride to sleep and due to the vibes in the ac for years it's

3802
03:58:14,140 --> 03:58:26,200
lame it really is lame it's just lame I mean, I know that
the ride will still be the same because it will be Indiana

3803
03:58:26,200 --> 03:58:28,760
Jones and it's basically the same track.

3804
03:58:29,500 --> 03:58:31,260
So it will still be an exciting ride.

3805
03:58:33,340 --> 03:58:35,300
And the Enkanto ride will be another thing.

3806
03:58:39,770 --> 03:58:41,310
Oh, I'm so bummed.

3807
03:58:43,090 --> 03:58:44,130
I'm so bummed.

3808
03:58:49,140 --> 03:58:49,300
Ugh.

3809
03:58:56,130 --> 03:58:57,390
I love it, Indy.

3810
03:58:59,230 --> 03:59:11,590
I love Indiana Jones but I don't think we need three parks
with Indiana Jones when we had a perfectly good ride as

3811
03:59:11,590 --> 03:59:25,380
dinosaur you want Indiana Jones improve the one that's at
the California parks like fix that one having dinosaur was a

3812
03:59:25,380 --> 03:59:29,660
unique ride now we have the same ride at three places I
don't know.

3813
03:59:32,980 --> 03:59:33,360
You're right.

3814
03:59:33,500 --> 03:59:34,400
We need five.

3815
03:59:37,320 --> 03:59:37,560
Oh.

3816
03:59:40,140 --> 03:59:42,600
It's sad when something you enjoy disappears.

3817
03:59:46,280 --> 03:59:48,200
Dinoland just had such a nice charm.

3818
03:59:48,520 --> 03:59:51,460
I just wish I could have gotten to it more.

3819
03:59:53,600 --> 03:59:53,840
But.

3820
03:59:56,060 --> 03:59:56,580
But...

3821
03:59:58,780 --> 04:00:00,400
Make Bint your CEO.

3822
04:00:00,700 --> 04:00:01,700
She actually knows...

3823
04:00:01,700 --> 04:00:03,120
I wouldn't say that.

3824
04:00:03,360 --> 04:00:06,040
I need to go to this business class so I can learn the
business.

3825
04:00:07,460 --> 04:00:09,560
And cast my morals into the fire.

3826
04:00:11,280 --> 04:00:11,800
Apparently.

3827
04:00:13,420 --> 04:00:17,120
My morals and my guilt be cast away so I can...

3828
04:00:17,120 --> 04:00:17,740
No business.

3829
04:00:26,040 --> 04:00:27,900
I'll be the business...

3830
04:00:27,900 --> 04:00:28,840
Business...

3831
04:00:28,840 --> 04:00:29,340
Thank you.

3832
04:00:29,580 --> 04:00:30,480
Probably be back later.

3833
04:00:30,620 --> 04:00:32,080
I'll know the most business.

3834
04:00:32,240 --> 04:00:33,360
than any other ghost ever.

3835
04:00:33,520 --> 04:00:34,860
Wait, I meant to go to Emma, my bud.

3836
04:00:35,460 --> 04:00:37,620
Emma, did you know that this is what your boyfriend is
doing?

3837
04:00:37,940 --> 04:00:38,660
I have your questions, if you don't mind.

3838
04:00:39,280 --> 04:00:41,620
Your boyfriend is burning dolls in the ceremony.

3839
04:00:41,720 --> 04:00:43,260
What do you know about doll burning?

3840
04:00:43,700 --> 04:00:44,260
Doll burning.

3841
04:00:44,380 --> 04:00:45,840
I think it was something that they did on the course.

3842
04:00:46,400 --> 04:00:47,140
Simon mentioned it.

3843
04:00:47,140 --> 04:00:47,760
Oh, so you didn't know.

3844
04:00:47,760 --> 04:00:48,480
Oh, they didn't do that when you were there.

3845
04:00:48,540 --> 04:00:50,240
Wait, so you did know about this.

3846
04:00:52,980 --> 04:00:53,300
Okay.

3847
04:00:54,020 --> 04:00:54,660
Okay, wait.

3848
04:00:56,180 --> 04:00:57,040
Wait, so you did know?

3849
04:00:58,100 --> 04:00:58,420
Okay.

3850
04:00:59,480 --> 04:00:59,800
Okay.

3851
04:00:59,940 --> 04:01:01,740
Have you seen this before?

3852
04:01:03,980 --> 04:01:14,920
no don't think so and do you know about the auto hypnosis do
you know what auto hypnosis is um it's some type of

3853
04:01:14,920 --> 04:01:23,900
self-hypnosis isn't it yeah have you ever tried it no I
haven't but I think Kate was into it she learned it from

3854
04:01:23,900 --> 04:01:33,300
when she went to Atlas and what did she tell you about it um
not a lot really I think I think she uses it as a sort of

3855
04:01:33,300 --> 04:01:34,440
self-meditation.

3856
04:01:37,260 --> 04:01:39,440
Has never tried auto-hypnosis herself.

3857
04:01:39,980 --> 04:01:40,460
I don't know.

3858
04:01:40,620 --> 04:01:42,660
I feel like what she was looking into the mirror earlier.

3859
04:01:47,700 --> 04:01:49,840
I feel like that's what she was doing, no?

3860
04:01:52,080 --> 04:01:52,480
Right.

3861
04:01:53,980 --> 04:01:56,520
She was, like, kind of getting freaky with it.

3862
04:01:58,140 --> 04:01:58,720
I'm going to see.

3863
04:01:58,840 --> 04:02:01,860
Demonstrated that she knew how to use it, but has never
tried it.

3864
04:02:03,800 --> 04:02:05,720
Maybe it's just the scrying part.

3865
04:02:08,440 --> 04:02:08,880
You know what, though?

3866
04:02:09,240 --> 04:02:11,140
Also, she knows that her boyfriend does all of this.

3867
04:02:11,620 --> 04:02:18,320
And yet, it's not that strange that she stayed with him
because she slept with the guy that made all of this.

3868
04:02:20,880 --> 04:02:21,900
So, you know what?

3869
04:02:22,460 --> 04:02:22,720
Maybe...

3870
04:02:22,720 --> 04:02:23,700
That's all for the moment.

3871
04:02:23,760 --> 04:02:25,700
Maybe Emma is a lost cause.

3872
04:02:31,840 --> 04:02:32,280
Maybe...

3873
04:02:33,180 --> 04:02:33,780
Emma's into it.

3874
04:02:33,800 --> 04:02:38,320
it emma emma emma's real into it i think maybe

3875
04:02:41,980 --> 04:02:51,560
stop looking for sane people here edenton's crazy a couple
more questions if that's okay okay i'm starting to get

3876
04:02:51,560 --> 04:02:58,800
hungry though so we're gonna ask these questions and then i
think all only that it's part of the course i i'll call it

3877
04:02:58,800 --> 04:03:07,080
after this interrogation dozens for him you made them oh
right can't make anything he's practically dyspraxic what's

3878
04:03:07,080 --> 04:03:22,000
dyspraxic mean oh ryan is practically dyspraxic what does
that mean clumsy yeah spaghetti look at that that looks like

3879
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:32,760
a healthy bowl of spaghetti now doesn't it we're making me
hungry let's ask about the dvd do you know anything about

3880
04:03:32,760 --> 04:03:36,060
this No, sorry.

3881
04:03:36,400 --> 04:03:37,240
Ask Ryan.

3882
04:03:40,420 --> 04:03:40,880
Okay.

3883
04:03:42,080 --> 04:03:43,000
Spaghetti time.

3884
04:03:44,180 --> 04:03:48,860
Do you know anything about hypnosis used on the Atlas
course?

3885
04:03:49,280 --> 04:03:52,440
Are you sure you mean hypnosis or the power of persuasion?

3886
04:03:53,120 --> 04:03:53,800
What's the difference?

3887
04:03:54,040 --> 04:03:54,860
I think it's the hypnosis.

3888
04:03:55,060 --> 04:03:55,460
Not a lot.

3889
04:03:56,180 --> 04:03:59,500
But if you want someone to do something, it's usually easier
to ask nicely.

3890
04:03:59,720 --> 04:04:01,360
I think it's literally the thing that they brought up.

3891
04:04:03,800 --> 04:04:05,680
Don't all businesses use it, Inspector?

3892
04:04:06,480 --> 04:04:07,300
Ever heard of advertising?

3893
04:04:10,520 --> 04:04:12,140
Are we being hypnotized?

3894
04:04:13,260 --> 04:04:20,060
Are our advertisements hypnotizing us as a self-hypnosis of
the brain?

3895
04:04:21,920 --> 04:04:23,420
She's gaslighting us.

3896
04:04:24,740 --> 04:04:26,320
She's so smug and annoys me.

3897
04:04:26,380 --> 04:04:27,120
I know, right?

3898
04:04:27,260 --> 04:04:30,960
She's like, don't you think it's actually...

3899
04:04:30,960 --> 04:04:33,400
Don't you think it's actually...

3900
04:04:42,300 --> 04:04:46,700
Don't you think, actually, I persuaded you just now?

3901
04:04:49,440 --> 04:04:52,660
Guys, I need to go to this course that I don't know
anything.

3902
04:04:56,100 --> 04:04:57,900
I don't know anything about business.

3903
04:04:58,180 --> 04:04:59,400
I need to go back.

3904
04:04:59,520 --> 04:05:00,560
I need to go back.

3905
04:05:00,660 --> 04:05:01,420
I need to go at all.

3906
04:05:03,800 --> 04:05:04,820
I need to go at all.

3907
04:05:04,960 --> 04:05:05,740
I need to go at all.

3908
04:05:06,360 --> 04:05:10,880
But guys, I also need to go make some food because I am a
hungry, hungry ghost.

3909
04:05:11,900 --> 04:05:12,360
And you.

3910
04:05:14,920 --> 04:05:20,200
You're getting very, very sleepy.

3911
04:05:21,760 --> 04:05:23,180
You're getting hypnosed.

3912
04:05:25,300 --> 04:05:25,860
Hypnotized.

3913
04:05:30,340 --> 04:05:30,640
Wait.

3914
04:05:31,660 --> 04:05:31,880
No.

3915
04:05:33,080 --> 04:05:50,490
I'm thoroughly persuaded you're getting hypnotized and you
want to subscribe to mint phantom made mint channel you are
