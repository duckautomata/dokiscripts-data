Welcome to my, uh, I decided this on a whim, my impromptu
Valentine's karaoke.

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,340
Because I won't really be able to do a proper stream on
Valentine's Day, sad.

10

Um, but yeah, uh, we're here for, for, for the vibes that

13
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,900
Well, it's not on Valentine's Day.

14
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,040
But it's the day before Valentine's Day, my 3D jazz show.

15
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,360

I want everybody to always feel like you guys are so loved.

55

Looking forward to the concert.

00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,220
I'll be watching the bottom of my party.

59
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,680

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,440

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,620
Um, what was I gonna say?

64
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,320
Oh, though, you guys, did you guys see that there's a state
of play on Thursday?

65
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,760
And...

66
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,620
There's a state of play on Thursday, and...

67
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,060
There's rumors of both DMC and Metal Gear?

68
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,060
I might have to try and fit in a street.

69
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,540
I might have to try and fit in a watch-along.

70
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,740
If I can.

71
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,060
If I have internet, I will do so.

72
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,160
Even though it's the day before my concert.

73
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,640
But it's only an hour long, so whatever.

74
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,220
I just won't scream.

75
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,080
I'll just be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, if anything is
announced.

76
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,980
Couldn't make it to the Valentine's concert, but we're going

83
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,060
I can't!

84
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,900
I literally have to preserve my voice for the jazz.

85
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm rather fond of this ghost maid.

86
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,080
Yeah, my whisper screaming.

87
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,480
My whisper screaming.

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,620

Oh, Valentine's Day.

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:26,780

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:33,200
go see the mortuary assistant together right guys for
valentine's day we're gonna go see the mortuary assistant

Yeah.

148
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,880
Oh my gosh, it looks so scary.

149
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,260
You guys, I saw a review on it.

150
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,520
Oh my gosh, I saw a review.

151
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,700
And apparently, hold on, I'm tapping into my past brain.

152
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:59,280
But apparently, from the review that I saw, the guy
described it as what the Silent Hill movie thought it was.

153
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:09,960
And that, oh my gosh, it has a, oh, oh, I remember the
practical effects artist from the scariest story.

154
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:19,040
to tell in the dark movie he does the practical effects in
the mortuary assistant movie yeah and it's the same guy who

155
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:28,620
made terrifier i'm i'm afraid the game wasn't so gory but it
is like a little like you know obviously you're you're you

156
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:40,240
are you are uh what's the sound um embalming bodies so i've
heard that the bodies look quite realistic which is Pretty

157
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,920
freaky.

158
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,060
Phil, thank you so much for the peek.

159
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,600

If you can eat popcorn during that, I will bow down to you.

163
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,560
I feel like popcorn.

164
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,220
If I were eating a burger, maybe no.

165
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
But popcorn, I probably could eat anytime.

166
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,920
It's popcorn.

167
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,520
It's popcorn.

168
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,400
It's popcorn.

169
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:18,760
I think it's fine I'm excited I want to see it But I think I
will be so scared And not sleep ever again I even want to

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,680
So that's kind of fun.

178
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,800
That's kind of fun.

179
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,480
Leve, I love you.

180
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,240
The skyscrapers causing vertigo.

181
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,660
The countdown begins in Tokyo.

182
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:07,960
27 days alone means 20 million ways to cope without you.

183
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:20,260
I'm in a reckless weaver, love-struck girl, I tease her,
thought I'd never be her, quite the job you've done on me,

184
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:33,480
sir, you've been hosting parties, in my mind I'm working
over time to have you in my world, oh what a curse it is to

185
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,920
be a lover girl.

186
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
Oh, I ran out of breath.

187
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,480
Forced to get creative, wrote my feelings down.

188
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,900
The independent lady in me is nowhere to be found.

189
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,720
I can't wait another day to see you.

190
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,440
How embarrassing to be this way.

191
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm in a reckless fever.

192
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,700
Love struck a light teaser.

193
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:20,520
ever be her quite the job you've done on me sir you've been
hosting parties in my mind i'm working over time to have you

194
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:34,560
in my world oh what a curse it is to be in love i wait by
the phone like a high school movie dream at the shows you'll

195
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:46,700
come running to me I see you in the wings, God, I'm
hallucinating.

196
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,200
What a reckless fever, love-struck girl, I tease her.

197
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,640
Thought I'd never be her, quite the job you've done on me,
sir.

198
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,000
You've been hosting parties, in my mind I'm working.

199
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,960
Over time you've become my whole world.

200
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl.

201
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,440
Love a girl.

202
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,780
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

I love Leve.

205
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,960
Actually, it was very hard for the jazz show to not pick so
many Leve songs.

206
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:56,900

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
But we should sing happy songs.

218
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,600
I'm going on my date.

219
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:55,860

222
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,580
Were you born as a little chocolate?

223
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,820
That's me.

224
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,400
I'm the bird.

225
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,280
Sorry, I didn't warm up either.

226
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:52,420
Do people still give those hearts that have like the really
awkward like exo-exo-gossip girl.

227
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,860
Those ones, those, they taste terrible.

228
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,960
They're like chalk.

229
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,100
Yeah, the chalky hearts.

230
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,540
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

231
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,780
Oh, they're so bad.

232
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,120
I once told this before, but mine's on the 15th.

233
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,820
No, I won't be around on the 15th.

234
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,680
Happy early birthday.

235
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,440
Happy Valentine's Day, Minto!

236
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,740
Happy Valentine's Day!

237
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:37,540
Oh, when I once was in ghoul school And it was Valentine's
Day I did not go to the school Don't, yes, I did go to the

238
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:50,780
school I did not go to the store And buy pre-made
Valentine's cards No, no, no I I Myself made my own in

239
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,260
PowerPoint And I Made them cryptid themed

240
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:08,440
And so everybody in my class got cryptid like Bigfoot.

241
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:15,520
And there

242
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,190
was something else.

243
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,930
I know I made one that was like, I'm skunk ape over you.

244
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,230
Mothman.

245
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,590
Yes, yes, yes.

246
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,070
I can't remember the other ones.

247
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,510
I just remember the Skunkade one.

248
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,770
They were all Metal Gear themed, I wish.

249
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,190
And then they had, like, the pictures of the cryptids.

250
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:44,930
Not them.

251
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,250
Oh, so silly.

252
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,550
So silly.

253
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,370
But, you know, everybody, it's a school of ghosts, so.

254
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,510

297
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,220
I remember the guys doing that dance on the bus or whatever.

298
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,160
Where they would, like, punch up in the air.

299
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,440
Can I get some spaghetti?

300
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,440
I need some to drop in front of a cute ghost girl.

301
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,900
You'll have to wait a couple hours.

302
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,440
It only comes at midnight.

303
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,960
It's Yowie at the end.

304
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
No way!

305
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,820
Our Oshiris.

306
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,700
In short, Oshiri.

307
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,040
Would have gotten me good.

308
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,900
Not the Oshiri.

309
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Oshiri.

310
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,220
Got my streaming ticket.

00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,560
Can't wait to see you on Friday.

312
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,520

317
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,580
First ever proper Minto stream Gladys karaoke Welcome!

318
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,520
Welcome

319
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:29,100
Paul Larry Jepson, there was another song that she did
somewhat recently that was like, hold on, Carly, that I

320
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,620
liked.

321
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,220
It was like maybe a couple years ago or something, but she
had like a kind of a comeback.

322
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,520
D'Argo, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

323
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,440
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,500
Minto's Oshiri indeed gets all the eyeballs.

325
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,640
My Oshiri brings all the boys to the yard and they are like,
it's a better time in the yard.

326
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,540
I know, but she kind of like, you know, after calling me
maybe, I think people were like, oh, she is so overplayed.

327
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,300
I feel bad.

328
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:12,600
You know, I feel bad when like, when an artist goes viral
and it's like, um, it's like people get mad at them that

329
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,920
their song is unoverplayed, but it's not their fault.

330
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,260
You know, like it's not their fault that people are
listening to their stuff, right?

331
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:32,880
it's what do you do just want them to not put out music I
don't understand it burns out with the public yeah yeah it's

332
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:44,400
suffering from success truly truly there was one song though
I can't remember at all I remember seeing it like trending

333
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,740
though and people were like oh my gosh Carly Ray Jepson
she's so good again but

334
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,720
our Oshi Oishi Oshiri.

335
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,060
Why are we bringing up my Oshiri?

336
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,210
I like her album dedicated.

337
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,810
I haven't listened to a lot of her stuff, I'll be honest.

338
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,670
But I can't wait to see you on Friday.

339
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,510
Thank you!

340
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,710
I can't believe it's Friday.

341
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,490
I'm so nervous.

342
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,150
I'm so nervous.

343
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,190
So, so, so, run away.

344
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:24,530
Hold on.

345
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,530
I'm going to listen to it real quick.

346
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:25,930
Run away.

347
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,770
It might have been that one.

348
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,890
Oh my gosh.

349
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,270

I don't know what, I don't think.

352
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,170
I might know it if I hear her, or like hear her singing it.

353
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:43,610
Body,

I forgot I had the lead vocal on!

380
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,020

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:28,470

afraid to fall but watching you stand alone all of my doubt

386
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:52,630
suddenly goes away somehow One step closer I have died every
day waiting for you Darling, don't be afraid I have loved

387
00:37:52,630 --> 00:38:02,190
you for a thousand years I love you for a thousand more

388
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,740
Still, beauty in all she is.

389

I will be brave.

390
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:32,980
I will not let anything take away, but standing in front of
me.

391
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:41,220
Every breath, every hour has come to this.

392
00:38:41,440 --> 00:39:02,140
One step closer I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you for a thousand

One step closer.

397
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,840

00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,600

That song's so fun.

431
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,310
Yippee!

432
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,650
Oh, someone said love fool earlier, right?

433
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,190
Let me do that.

434
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,530
Love fool before I forget.

435
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,740
Wait, there's a bossa nova version?

436
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,170
Wait, what does this sound like?

437
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:48,290
Facing a problem, you love me no.

438
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,310
And maybe there is nothing that I can do.

439
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,140
Oh, this sounds nice.

440
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:06,260
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother that I ought just stick
to...

441
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,900
Wait, is this a love song or...

442
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:25,900
She deserves to be But I think you do So I cry And I pray
And I beg Love me, love me Say that you love me Fool me,

443
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,280

444
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:39,960

00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:35,420
What I could have done in another way to make...

450
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,720
It's too long!

451
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:49,380
Reason will not lead to solution I will end up lost in
confusion I don't care if you...

452
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,680
It's too long!

453
00:48:51,180 --> 00:49:07,220
As long as you don't go So I cry and I pray and I beg Love
me, love me Say that you love me Fool me, fool me Go on and

Hey, Fatafeev, thank you so much.

462
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,410
Oh my goodness, for the big Arca don't know.

00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,090
Thank you, Arca Supa, thank you.

464
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,090
At least your lovely, lovely day karaoke is here to soften
the blow.

465
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,990
Lay all your love on me by Abba.

466
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,390
That's a love song.

467
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,170
Wait, how does that go again?

468
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,810
The ghost is your emotion.

469
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:54,950
I don't remember.

470
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,340
I only know the chorus, I think.

471
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,070
They are your love.

472
00:50:59,110 --> 00:50:59,590
Hold on.

473
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,230
Let me listen to it.

474
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,190
Let me see if I remember.

475
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,650
They are your love.

476
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,150
I don't know

477
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,760
if I remember it, but I'll try

478
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:55,620
I wasn't jealous before we met Now every woman I see is a
potential threat Oh, I kind of remember it, oh my gosh, wait

479
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:03,940
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice Wait, what's the, wait,
hold on, I'm saying what the vocals One thing is my only

480
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:19,820
vice But now it isn't true Now everything is new And all
I've ever learned has overturned I beg of you

481
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:35,580
Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me

482
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:54,290
It was like shooting a sitting duck A little small talk, a
smile, baby I was struck I still don't know what you've done

483
00:52:54,290 --> 00:53:08,430
with me A grown-up woman should never fall so easily I
remember I feel the kind of fear When I don't have you near

484
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:36,950
I skip my pride, I beg you dear Don't go wasting your
emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your

485
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:47,410
devotion All your love on me Yeah!

486
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,170
No other Oshis.

487
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,110
Nah, I'm just kidding.

488
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,170
Unless.

489
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,760
They've been pretty scarce.

490
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,840
I used to think that was sensible.

491
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,080
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible.

492
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,580
Because everything is new.

493
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,220
And everything is you.

494
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,590
Burn has overturned.

495
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,410
What can I do?

496
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:38,910
Don't go wasting your emotion.

497
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:45,170
Lay all your love on me.

498
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,590

01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:33,340

01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,600
I had a date also canceled for your concert.

789
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,540
This was peak karaoke.

790
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:44,740
This happened to be last year on Valentine's after being
single for a year and then she canceled.

791
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:45,660
No!

792
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:54,660
For all of us saddies, we sing the sad karaoke songs.

793
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:02,160
of the ones that got away but for those of us who do not
have a valentine

794
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:30,820
i saw your green hair a beauty mark next to your mouth
they're on the subway i nearly had a breakdown a few weeks

795
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:46,880
later somebody wore your perfume it almost killed me I had
to leave the room, it's just another day And it's not over,

796
01:28:47,240 --> 01:29:04,660
till it's over, it's never over It's just another day, and
it's not over, till it's over And it's never over, till I

797
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:18,880
don't look for you on the stairs Or wish you thought that we
were still soulmates But I'm still counting down all of the

798
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:35,800
days Till you're just another girl on the subway Made you
the villain, evil for just moving on I see your shadow, I

799
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:47,480
see it even more With the lights off, I made a promise If in
reds this feeling ain't gone Well, fuck this city, I'm

800
01:29:47,480 --> 01:30:05,700
moving to Saskatchewan It's just another day And it's not
over, till it's over, till it's over It's just another day,

801
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:21,620
and it's not over Till it's over, it's never over Till I can
break routine during foreplay And trust myself that I won't

802
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:39,820
say your name But I'm still counting down all of the days
Till you're just another girl on the subway She's got away.

803
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,940
She's got away.

804
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,560
She's got away.

805
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:51,240
And she got, she got away.

806
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:53,320
She got away.

807
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:53,900
She got away.

808
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,640
She's got, she's got away.

809
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,380
She's got away.

810
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:20,900
And she got, she got, she got away, she got away, she got
away, she got away.

811
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:33,600
She's got, she's got away, she's got away.

01:31:37,720 --> 01:32:01,700

814
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:14,630
What am I supposed to do?

We'll go see the mortuary assistant.

816
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,650
We'll go see the mortuary assistant.

817
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:25,390
That was the subway.

818
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:29,250
I'm still not feeling over it, though.

819
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:35,090
She's got a wisp.

Maybe I'll see you at Christmas Maybe I'll see you at New
Year's Maybe I'll laugh like you never felt When I see you

855
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:41,640
again in two years Maybe I'll all be different Maybe your
hair will be shorter Maybe we won't even talk anymore When

856
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:59,000
we're older, I'll be missing you Every minute you aren't
here The future isn't clear Oh, oh, maybe All we have is

857
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:17,080

859
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:31,520
Maybe one day I'll get married And you'll be my maid of
honor And during your toast, you'll make everyone cry And

860
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:41,300
I'll finally see tears from my father Maybe our kids will be
best friends We'll live down the street from each other And

861
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:53,820
maybe I'll smile because your daughter laughs like her
mother I'll be missing you Every minute you are in tears The

862
01:37:53,820 --> 01:38:15,980
future isn't clear Oh, maybe All we have is maybe Maybe I'll
I'll see you again Oh, maybe All we have is maybe Maybe,

song is wildflower by billy eyelash

906
01:43:43,160 --> 01:44:03,520
Things fall apart And time breaks your heart I wasn't there
but I know She was your girl You showed her the world But

907
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:18,640
fell out of love And you both let go She was crying on my
shoulder All I could do was hold her Only made us closer

908
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:33,320
Until July Now I know that you love me You don't need to
remind me I should put it all behind me Shouldn't I?

909
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:58,760
But I see her In the back of my mind All the time Like a
fever Like I'm burning alive Like a sign Did

910
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,560
I cross the line?

911
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:36,760
Things don't last and life moves so fast I'd never ask who
was better Cause she couldn't be more different than me

912
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:59,960
Happy and free in leather And I know that you love me When I
put it all behind me But maybe I see her In the back of my

913
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:16,620
mind All the time Just like a fever Like I'm burning alive
Like a sign

914
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:29,240
Did I cross the line?

915
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:34,600
I'm staying

916
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:55,760
crying in the hotel I know you didn't mean to hurt me So I
kept it to myself And I wonder, do you see her?

917
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:04,060
back of your mind in my eyes.

918
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:32,230
You say no one knows you so well, but every time you touch
me, I just wonder how she felt.

919
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:37,870
Valentine's Day, crying in the hotel.

920
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:44,870
I know it didn't mean to hurt me, I kept it to myself.

921
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:50,370
Yay!

922
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:51,790

I did my best.

924
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:54,330
