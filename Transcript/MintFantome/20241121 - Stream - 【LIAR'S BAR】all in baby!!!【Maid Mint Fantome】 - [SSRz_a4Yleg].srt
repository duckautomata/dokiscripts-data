1
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,340
Welcome to the bar.

2
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,080
I'm a truth teller.

3
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, you can't see it.

4
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,100
I'm a truther.

5
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,020
Yeah, I'm not a liar.

6
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,660
I'm a truther.

7
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,600
I don't believe you.

8
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,320
It says right here.

9
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,500
Truth teller.

10
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,220
Hi guys!

11
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,980
I hope you guys are good.

12
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
I felt that maybe...

13
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,760
Okay, this is kind of... Sounds like a fly buzzing in my ear.

14
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
I felt like...

15
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,100
I felt like maybe the eyepatch would go well here.

16
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,560
Right.

17
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,820
Sounds like something Huey Emerick would say.

18
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,060
I'm no liar.

19
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,540
I'm a truther.

20
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,860
I'm a truther.

21
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,580
Anyway, I've never played this game.

22
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,280
I don't know really anything about it, honestly.

23
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,260
Just that I've seen everybody playing it.

24
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,620
So I was like, I want to play it too.

25
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,980
I saw that you could play with people, so I was like, I want to play with people.

26
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,000
So...

27
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,140
Both games are very, very simple.

28
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,880
Okay, cool.

29
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,220
Awesome.

30
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:45,040
I saw that there's like piggies and there's fox ladies and there's a wolf thing.

31
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,660
I don't know.

32
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,120
Do your best outlaw accent.

33
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,240
I spit tobacco in buckets.

34
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,220
Oh wait, there's only pigs?

35
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,040
What?

36
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,220
Did the promotional images lie?

37
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
Oh my God.

38
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,720
There's a bunny lady.

39
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,920
I reckon.

40
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,140
I reckon there's a storm a-coming.

41
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,400
There's a storm heading your way.

42
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,800
And it's name is...

43
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,840
Oh wait, I feel like I gotta talk with my mouth kind of to the side.

44
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,720
I feel like I gotta talk like...

45
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,680
I...

46
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,720
I gotta talk like I...

47
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,960
Hey now, this town ain't big enough for the two of us.

48
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,400
I feel like Sonic the Hedgehog right now, I'm not gonna lie.

49
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,060
I feel like Sonic the Hedgehog.

50
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,620
Why Sonic?

51
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,600
Because his mouth is always on the side.

52
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,700
What are you talking about?

53
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,640
His mouth is always like right over here.

54
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,400
Good luck on not losing first, Minto.

55
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,820
But my money is on the wisp.

56
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,200
What?

57
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,820
Okay, I'm gonna enter the bar so we don't have to... There we go.

58
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:31,660
If you get into the lobby, please, of course, don't watch the stream.

59
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,960
Of course, you guys.

60
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,560
Please.

61
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,660
Let's all be...

62
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,280
Let's all be... I know this is the liar's bar.

63
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,280
Let's all be a little...

64
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,100
But liars can still be fair, right?

65
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,720
Minkie, Minkie, Minkie...

66
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,600
Wow, Vicky!

67
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,040
What the hell, Ashes?

68
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,020
Thank you!

69
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,500
Love you, Minto.

70
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,600
Love you, Duskull!

71
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,920
It's called liar's bar, not cheaters bar.

72
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,960
Yeah, exactly.

73
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,400
At least, I like y'all play fair.

74
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,060
I reckon we all play fair.

75
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,320
Right?

76
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,420
Yeah.

77
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,260
And um, I'm actually waiting on like, oh my gosh, you guys.

78
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,060
Before we like start playing.

79
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm so mad at myself.

80
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,900
I...

81
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,760
I hate time zones.

82
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,160
I hate time zones.

83
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,780
I was waiting, I'm waiting on an important email.

84
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,940
Because...

85
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,120
I had an, I had a meeting last week.

86
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,440
And I put it in my calendar wrong because of time zones.

87
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,060
It was an important meeting.

88
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,480
I put it in late.

89
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,120
I put it in, I put it in for the day after.

90
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,380
And I was, I apologized to them.

91
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,780
I was like, I'm so sorry.

92
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,360
Time zones.

93
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,900
And then, I did it again last night.

94
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,820
I thought it was tonight.

95
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,800
And it was yesterday night.

96
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,220
This is why we need the time glove.

97
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,620
Oh gosh.

98
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,640
And they like kept sending me emails being like, we're in the meeting room.

99
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,200
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

100
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,420
I'm so sorry.

101
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,080
So...

102
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,400
Um...

103
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,880
Yeah.

104
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:38,880
Oh.

105
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,620
Is it your birthday?

106
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,660
Hold on.

107
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,680
Hold on.

108
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
I mean though, yesterday was my 22nd birthday.

109
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,680
But I couldn't watch the stream because some friends wanted to treat me for dinner.

110
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,920
Oh, wow.

111
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,500
No, I'm just kidding.

112
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,980
May I get a happy birthday from you, boss?

113
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,400
Of course.

114
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,420
You'll get a country version.

115
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,820
Bown, bown, bown.

116
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,600
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,960
Happy birthday to you.

118
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,560
Happy birthday, Peter Thickems.

119
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,520
Happy birthday to the Florida man.

120
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,260
Happy birthday!

121
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,140
Yes.

122
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,820
Wait, hold on.

123
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,620
Oh no, it disappeared.

124
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,060
I think it's your super chat.

125
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,820
Mike Tyson.

126
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,540
This town ain't big enough for the both of us.

127
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,080
Man, my...

128
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,980
My ass is too big...

129
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,200
For this...

130
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,340
For this town.

131
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,680
I'm moving on.

132
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,120
Is there gonna be voice chat?

133
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,700
Oh, no.

134
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,620
No, no.

135
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
Let me turn that off.

136
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,040
Is that a thing?

137
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,180
Audio.

138
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,230
Like I said, I don't know anything about this game.

139
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,810
I forgot this is coming up.

140
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,810
I'm not gonna get to play with you tonight because of my homework.

141
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,210
No!

142
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,810
Good luck with your homework.

143
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,790
I think that's character audio.

144
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,330
You have to mute individually.

145
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,450
Okay, I can do that.

146
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,810
During a match only?

147
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,710
That's so stinky.

148
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,510
Alright, we'll bring it back.

149
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,370
I actually booked my returning connection flight for the wrong days thanks to time zone.

150
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:39,810
No!

151
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,050
No!

152
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,010
I know, it's so bad.

153
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,130
I...

154
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,950
I'm so upset at myself.

155
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,630
So I...

156
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,710
It's kind of like made me feel so...

157
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,590
Because of it.

158
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,710
I was like, I've never really made that kind of mistake before.

159
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,970
And it's such an important meeting.

160
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,990
So I was like, no, please.

161
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,650
A Canadian invented time zones on behalf of my country.

162
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,930
I apologize for making you miss your meeting.

163
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,650
Dang Canada.

164
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,870
Dang Canada.

165
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,510
Queen's only cause.

166
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,830
Queen's only cause, that's all we know.

167
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:38,450
But yeah, so I'm waiting on an email to confirm the rescheduling time.

168
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,630
So if I'm like, one second guys.

169
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,390
It's most likely me checking my phone to see if I have gotten an email.

170
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,170
So and if you guys want to remind me to sometimes and be like, hey Minto, check your email.

171
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,990
That would be also very much appreciated.

172
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,590
No, but don't spam it or anything.

173
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,170
It can be like, I don't know.

174
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,450
I don't know.

175
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,730
How long do these games last?

176
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,330
Maybe like every game or something.

177
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,890
I don't know.

178
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,310
Apologies on behalf of Canada.

179
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,160
Yeah, they've been so patient with me.

180
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,160
I feel so bad.

181
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,700
Backseating the business emails is crazy.

182
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,100
Look, my phone, people will message me and my phone doesn't alert me.

183
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,720
When I'm like, my phone doesn't alert me ever.

184
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,280
So I never know when people, someone's messaging me or texting me or whatever.

185
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,840
So I wouldn't get a notification about my, about my email.

186
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,160
What the heck is this?

187
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,860
Oh, there's something sticky under my desk.

188
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,200
It's actually where the lights used to be.

189
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,360
Okay, let's play then.

190
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,680
Um, I'm gonna host a game.

191
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,260
Oh, if it's gonna be Mint Frantum, the Freak Lobby.

192
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,800
And yeah, is there a password in these things or no?

193
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,680
I guess not.

194
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,680
Lobby.

195
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,480
Lobby, lobby.

196
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,160
Lobby, boop.

197
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,920
The Freak Lobby.

198
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,040
There's a lobby code.

199
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,220
Friends only gives password.

200
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,620
Okay, cool, cool.

201
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,320
Friends only.

202
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,020
Wow, I'm scooby.

203
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,620
Oh, there it is.

204
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,140
Wait.

205
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,380
How do I...

206
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,240
Hold on, I'll turn off the audio just in case you guys start talking.

207
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,700
How do I make you shut up?

208
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,520
How do I make you shut up?

209
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,280
How do I make it?

210
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,100
Wait, I don't hear...

211
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,920
How did you guys get the number so fast?

212
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,800
You guys are crazy.

213
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,100
Oh, during the match, okay.

214
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,040
Oh, what?

215
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,140
We can't talk in here.

216
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,080
Enter the chat.

217
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,300
Okay, how do I change my character?

218
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,220
Oh, Foxy.

219
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,660
Oh my god.

220
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,000
You just jerk.

221
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,660
All right.

222
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,040
Sorry, I know you can't hear it right now.

223
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,860
All right.

224
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,500
What do I do?

225
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm waiting.

226
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,080
Ready up guys, I guess.

227
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,220
Liars deck or liars...

228
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,340
You can't hear it.

229
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,660
Listen.

230
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,220
Liars deck.

231
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,680
Liars deck.

232
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,000
Liars dice.

233
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,520
Liars dice.

234
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,780
Deck is more fun.

235
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,700
Liars deck.

236
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,300
Oh god.

237
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,080
Liars deck.

238
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,860
Stop, shut up.

239
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,620
Okay, we'll keep it on.

240
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,000
Keep it on basic.

241
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,860
Stop, please.

242
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,860
Okay, okay.

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,640
Oh, we're starting.

244
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,180
All right.

245
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,520
Hold on.

246
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,620
I'm gonna mute it real quick.

247
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,020
Shut up everybody.

248
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,780
Oh, wow.

249
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,280
The game is where your best friend...

250
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,260
Oh, never mind.

251
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,740
Liars bar.

252
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,500
Shut up!

253
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,540
Shut up!

254
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,120
How do I make you shut up?

255
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,780
Oh, voice chat off.

256
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,560
Okay, there we go.

257
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,700
Who said that?

258
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,120
Huh?

259
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,440
Who said that?

260
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,860
Who said that?

261
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,260
Raise your hand.

262
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,200
Oh, that was my card.

263
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,540
Wait, what am I doing?

264
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,100
What's the rules?

265
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,060
I think that they just throw me in.

266
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,560
This is a good hand.

267
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,800
I didn't hear them.

268
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,960
Yeah, because I turned off the audio for you guys.

269
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,940
It was just someone being like, I can't believe I got in boys.

270
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,310
Oh, what do I do?

271
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,070
Oh my god.

272
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,830
One queen.

273
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,070
There you go.

274
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,140
Oh my gosh.

275
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,240
One queen.

276
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,160
One coin.

277
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,500
Are you sure about that?

278
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,340
Huh?

279
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,040
Are you sure about that?

280
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,740
Who the hell is that guy over there?

281
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,800
No, I think you're lying.

282
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,880
How do I accuse you?

283
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,180
How do I accuse you?

284
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
Are you muting him?

285
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,640
I don't know.

286
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,660
They can't hear you.

287
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,620
That's fine though.

288
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,660
Oh, wait, hold on.

289
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,500
One queen.

290
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,640
Don't I have to be muted?

291
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,100
Wait, I'm confused.

292
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,180
Mute them.

293
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,320
Mute them.

294
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,340
And then turn voice chat on.

295
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,520
Hey, can you hear me?

296
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,780
Can you hear me?

297
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,480
Push the talk off.

298
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,780
Can you hear me?

299
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,420
Hello?

300
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,460
Can you hear me?

301
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,880
Oh my god, what's going on?

302
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,520
One queen.

303
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,240
Yeah.

304
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,680
One queen.

305
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,820
I don't think so.

306
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,860
I think that's a lie.

307
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,280
I don't know how to play this game.

308
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,120
Liar.

309
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,300
Yeah, get him!

310
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,220
Wait, what is that?

311
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,900
What does that mean?

312
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,260
Oh my god!

313
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,980
This one's for you, darling.

314
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,380
Close one.

315
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,140
What just happened?

316
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,060
Queen's table.

317
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,320
Oh, we get more!

318
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,900
Okay, I'm looking at my cards.

319
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,560
Don't look at my cards, okay?

320
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,160
You can look at your cards.

321
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,260
Yeah, don't look at my cards.

322
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,860
I'm looking at my cards.

323
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,920
What does that mean?

324
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,140
Huh?

325
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm confused.

326
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,360
So it's a queen...

327
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,140
A table...

328
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,500
It's a queen's table again?

329
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,910
How do I throw the card?

330
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,010
Oh, throw the card.

331
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,130
Okay.

332
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,990
Guys, I'm turning off push...

333
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,510
Or...

334
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,110
I turned off push to talk, but it's still telling me push to talk.

335
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,170
Uh -uh.

336
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,850
They're having a moment.

337
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

339
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,230
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,790
What?

341
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,130
King, baby.

342
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:50,910
King, baby.

343
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,350
Oh my god!

344
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,730
Crow!

345
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,810
Thank you for the Haka Super!

346
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,980
Oh yeah, baby!

347
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,880
Happy birthday!

348
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,160
Sorry, I didn't get to read it.

349
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,580
Hold on.

350
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,020
Okay.

351
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,950
I can play...

352
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,730
For real.

353
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,390
I'm gonna put down...

354
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,730
Definitely a king.

355
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,110
Nod.

357
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,870
Nod Galaxy.

358
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,270
Hey!

359
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:23,950
Hey, hey, hey.

360
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,330
Nod Galaxy.

361
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:25,870
No, no.

362
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,310
Yeah.

363
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,690
See?

364
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,830
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,470
King.

366
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,170
King.

367
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,250
King.

369
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,890
King.

370
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,050
How do I throw?

371
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:33,490
Throw.

372
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,610
What?!

373
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,970
Call liar?

374
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,070
Can I call liar?

375
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,410
Liar.

376
00:22:59,710 --> 00:22:59,950
Liar.

377
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,190
Well, ain't my first rodeo.

378
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,670
Okay.

379
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,570
Still a king's table.

380
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,170
Oh, I keep forgetting to turn off the audio.

381
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,790
Wait, how do I...

382
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,050
Hold on.

383
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,130
Push the talk...

384
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:32,590
On.

385
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,430
I want it...

386
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,530
I want it on.

387
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:34,790
Okay.

388
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,710
And...

389
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,250
Wait, how do I...

390
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:41,470
On.

391
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,250
King.

392
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,550
Oh, I see how you select the multiple.

393
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,710
I see it, I see it.

394
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,750
Hold on, crow.

395
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,910
I'm gonna sing you happy birthday.

396
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,690
I wanna read your message.

397
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,230
Celebrate.

398
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:50,990
I wanted to give thanks.

399
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,970
So, thanks for always helping me through the back...

400
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,910
Half of my shifts.

401
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,030
Thank you, crow!

402
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,150
Happy birthday!

403
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,630
Happy birthday to you!

404
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,090
Happy birthday to you!

405
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,410
Happy birthday, dear crow!

406
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,690
Happy birthday to you!

407
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,500
What if I...

408
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,040
Also did two kings?

409
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,250
One king.

410
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,830
I'm still learning the ropes, you guys.

411
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,070
I'm still learning the ropes, okay?

412
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,820
One king.

413
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,000
One king.

414
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,700
One king.

415
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,120
Really?

416
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,640
Just one king?

417
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,300
Yeah?

418
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,060
I like when you guys look at me when I start talking.

419
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,020
One king.

420
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,260
One king.

421
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,960
One king.

422
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,240
One king.

423
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,640
One king.

424
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,200
Throw three at a time?

425
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,280
Why are you...

426
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,640
What?

427
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,880
What do you want from me?

428
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,840
Hello?

429
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,160
Hello?

430
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,480
Why are you staring at me?

431
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,000
Huh?

432
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,520
Oh, I had pushed the talk button and I wasn't pushing it down.

433
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,100
What do you mean?

434
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,120
Oh, shit.

435
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,000
I can explain.

436
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,580
Okay?

437
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,280
No, don't look at me like that!

438
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,680
Let's see if luck's still on my side.

439
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,120
Yeah, you'll never take me down, motherfuckers!

440
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,880
Bye, Bozo.

441
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,520
You thought, you thought.

442
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,760
What is this?

443
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, Ace's table.

444
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,260
Shit, guys.

445
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,820
I'm in trouble.

446
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,420
You know what?

447
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,900
Probably would be bad to, like, throw down multiple right now, right?

448
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,680
So...

449
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,220
Oh, uh...

450
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,920
Oh, shit!

451
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,420
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

452
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,960
Oh my god.

453
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,980
What the?

454
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,380
Yeah?

455
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,260
How did he talk?

456
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,060
How does he talk?

457
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,160
How does everybody have three aces?

458
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm calling bullshit.

459
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,520
This is not...

460
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,460
I think you're lying.

461
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,680
I think you're liars.

462
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,240
Actually, I'm gonna call liar.

463
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:57,800
Wait.

464
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,060
Liar.

465
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,860
Liar!

466
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,460
I'm calling you a liar to your face.

467
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:03,940
Shouse.

468
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,520
What is that?

469
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,420
Oh, I was wrong!

470
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
Let's see if luck's still on my side.

471
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,700
Luck is always on my side!

472
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,840
Oh,

473
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,420
it's a joker.

474
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,020
Oh, it's a queen's table now.

475
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,240
Never punished.

476
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,360
Why do I keep getting these shit ass hands?

477
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,360
Okay.

478
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,140
Oh, it's my turn.

479
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,260
You know what?

480
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,400
Yeah, I'll do it.

481
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,240
Two queens.

482
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,800
Two queens.

483
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,940
Where is the bullet?

484
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,000
I have no idea.

485
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,820
Liar!

486
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,420
I don't believe you.

487
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,780
I don't believe you.

488
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,460
Yeah.

489
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,380
Yeah.

490
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,820
I don't believe you at all.

491
00:27:59,460 --> 00:27:59,780
Yeah!

492
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,380
Yeah!

493
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:00,780
Yeah!

494
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,460
Take him out!

495
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,020
I think whoever sits in our seats is unlucky.

496
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,520
Just another scar for the collection.

497
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,600
A close one.

498
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,480
Oh my gosh.

499
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,800
Wait, so you keep going until...

500
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,800
Until there's a winner or rather...

501
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
Oh, what's my hand?

502
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,380
All right.

503
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,200
Oh, I have to...

504
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,280
Wait, is it my turn?

505
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:37,940
Oh.

506
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,660
Who's the first one?

507
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,240
Who's up?

508
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,120
Oh, it's Skizzard.

509
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,900
Make your move, man.

510
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,180
Did they forget to load the guns?

511
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,640
Maybe.

512
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,400
Why are you shaking your head at me, eh?

513
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Why are you shaking your head at me, eh?

514
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,420
Huh?

515
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,020
Huh?

516
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,760
Yeah.

517
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,940
Yeah, look somewhere else.

518
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,360
My eyes are up here.

519
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,760
Um...

520
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,680
You know what?

521
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,540
What is it?

522
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,380
A king table?

523
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,920
Three kings.

524
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,300
Luck is on my side, baby.

525
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,740
Three kings.

526
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,380
Someone's got a death wish.

527
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,320
I can't believe I made it.

528
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,020
No!

529
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,400
I was gonna win!

530
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,100
I was gonna get rid of my hand!

531
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,820
Skizzard, again?

532
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,380
Skizzard, it can't be just you and me the entire time, man.

533
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,140
Come on!

534
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,480
Ah!

535
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,980
You're gonna live!

536
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,440
Ah, see, I told you.

537
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,300
Oh my gosh, we did so well in that one!

538
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,780
Oh, getting rid of your hand isn't a win.

539
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,360
Oh, it's not?

540
00:29:59,520 --> 00:29:59,940
Oh, okay.

541
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,680
Is it just dying?

542
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,840
Oh, wait.

543
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,560
What?

544
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,560
Oh, aces table.

545
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,780
Alright, guys.

546
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,640
Someone's got a death wish.

547
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,800
Are you guys talking to each other?

548
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,780
Like, even though I can't hear you?

549
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,100
No?

550
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,060
Why not?

551
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,060
Why aren't you talking?

552
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,660
Make friends!

553
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,700
What are you doing?

554
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,570
In chat they are?

555
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,610
Oh, okay.

556
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,930
I'm gonna do this.

557
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,990
Two aces.

558
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,090
Why do I sound like that?

559
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,650
Why don't I have a cool deep voice?

560
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,230
What if instead of liar's bar it was freak bar?

561
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,430
I'm the wolf.

562
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,230
Oh!

563
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,670
What just...

564
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,230
Oh my God!

565
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,630
Oh my God!

566
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,770
Oh yeah!

567
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,390
Yeah!

568
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,370
Papa bear back there is invested.

569
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,870
Knight's table.

570
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,890
I'm the only one who didn't pick the pig.

571
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,190
King's table.

572
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,430
Okay, I'm starting to get the game more.

573
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:29,350
If you put down your last card the next person will automatically call liar on you.

574
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,530
Oh, thank you.

575
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,730
King's table.

576
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,850
King's table.

577
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,730
One king.

578
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,460
How many kings do I want to throw down?

579
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,440
I want to throw down.

580
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,620
This is only true if two people are left.

581
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh, I see, I see.

582
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,300
It's only when the last person is left.

583
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,320
I see, I see.

584
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,300
One king.

585
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,250
Chat giving me no bad advice.

586
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,570
No, they are trying to help.

587
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,270
Yes.

588
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,430
Yes.

589
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,730
Yes, I'm an honest pig.

590
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,150
One king.

591
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,110
I'm an honest pig.

592
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,190
One king.

593
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,150
One king.

594
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,950
Oh my god, the bear gets up.

595
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,450
Okay, I'll also do one king.

596
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,690
Everyone else is doing one king.

597
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,560
One king.

598
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,680
It was a real king, by the way.

599
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,430
Yes.

600
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,990
Yes.

601
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,690
Yes.

602
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,250
Yes.

603
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,630
One king.

604
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,290
Galaxy should have done it.

605
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,170
I think I'm going to call Shouse a liar no matter what.

606
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,850
Scares me every time.

607
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,990
Do it.

608
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,050
Liar.

609
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,110
Oh, that's not what I meant.

610
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,130
Oh my god, Skizzard.

611
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,970
Skizzard is so over...

612
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,930
This one is for you, darling.

613
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,770
No!

614
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,120
Oh my god.

615
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,220
Did we just play like nothing happened?

616
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,660
Oh my god.

617
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,620
Oh my god.

618
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,800
I'm next you guys.

619
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,720
It's one and zero.

620
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm so dead.

621
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,640
It's a king.

622
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,120
It's a king.

623
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,560
It's a king.

624
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:00,940
It's a king.

625
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,720
It's a king.

626
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,340
One king.

627
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,280
I'm playing it safe.

628
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,650
Oh my god.

629
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,430
Oh my god.

630
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,450
It's so over for me.

631
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,050
It's so over for me.

632
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,670
Yeah Galaxy, what are you going to do?

633
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,690
One king.

634
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,870
I'm going to sus out Shouse.

635
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,170
I'm going to sus him out.

636
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,110
I'm going to sus him out.

637
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,690
One king.

638
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,810
Okay, here we go.

639
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,630
Liar!

640
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,110
Liar!

641
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,270
Sorry, I have to.

642
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,470
Sayonara!

643
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:46,870
Sayonara!

644
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,210
Nevermind bitches!

645
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,610
I'm still in the game!

646
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,240
I think that's my last one.

647
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,220
How do I know if it's my last one or not?

648
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,220
Whenever I lie to my...

649
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,530
Oh, it's my turn.

650
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,230
Oh, it's a king's table.

651
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,190
Two kings.

652
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,790
Two kings.

653
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,430
You only have six shots.

654
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,230
Yeah, but I don't know how many I've done.

655
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,630
I think the top right is... Wait.

656
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,790
How do I... It doesn't show.

657
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,170
So I have two more.

658
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,630
Okay, okay.

659
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,550
Oh, when it's my turn.

660
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,050
Okay, okay.

661
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,750
Thank you guys.

662
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:45,770
Alright.

663
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,010
Oh, I was going to say sus him out.

664
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,990
I was going to say sus... I don't know.

665
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:53,710
Galaxy.

666
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,490
One king.

667
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,370
One king.

668
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,450
One king.

669
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,110
I think he's going to probably get me here.

670
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,850
But, it's going to be real.

671
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,670
Oh, wait.

672
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,690
One king.

673
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,270
It's real.

674
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,350
It's real.

675
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:27,910
Someone's lying.

676
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,850
One king.

677
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,390
Someone's got to be lying!

678
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,730
You're saying it out loud?

679
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,170
No, I'm muted you guys.

680
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:35,670
I'm muted.

681
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,370
I'm muted, right?

682
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,100
Take that, Galaxy.

683
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,180
Your first shot will be your last.

684
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,020
Who?

685
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,440
Oh, damn.

686
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,080
Nevermind.

687
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,620
You're streaming?

688
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, but they shouldn't be watching.

689
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,540
That's the thing.

690
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,180
They shouldn't be...

691
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,780
They'll be listening in stream?

692
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,800
No, they shouldn't be watching.

693
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,420
It says don't watch if you're playing.

694
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,120
Oh.

695
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,920
It's a queen's.

696
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
It's a queen's table.

697
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,560
I don't know.

698
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,500
I don't know.

699
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,500
Look away.

700
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,440
Very suspicious like.

701
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,640
Don't nod at each other like you know what's going on.

702
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,280
Are you in collusion?

703
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,280
Wait a second.

704
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,440
One queen.

705
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,980
If you guys are listening in this stream, shake your head.

706
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,400
Oh, don't look away.

707
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,640
The pigs are in coats.

708
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,080
One queen.

709
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Really?

710
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,460
Was that actually one queen?

711
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,520
Yeah?

712
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,840
Yeah?

713
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,100
It was?

714
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,780
If it really was, stand up.

715
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,160
Liar!

716
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,540
What was it?

717
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,760
Oh, it was a queen.

718
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,920
Goodbye, crew world.

719
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,880
Goodbye, crew world.

720
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,720
I enjoyed it.

721
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
Here!

722
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,560
What?

723
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,060
You'll never catch me deader than I already am, bitches!

724
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,480
I think they forgot to load the gun.

725
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,640
King's table.

726
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,320
Maybe it's because it's my first time.

727
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,620
The game is being very generous to me or something.

728
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,200
I don't know.

729
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,800
Anyway.

730
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,080
I think that was too fast.

731
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,120
That was way too fast, I think.

732
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,980
That was fast.

733
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,700
Streamer luck, I know, right?

734
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,560
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,740
I don't know if that was a king or not.

736
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,660
It's up to you, shouse.

737
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,200
One king.

738
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm basically... I'm a dead wolf ghost in any way, so you know...

739
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,280
It doesn't matter what you guys do.

740
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,800
One king.

741
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,580
Liar!

742
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,100
Really?

743
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,640
I'm no liar!

744
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,280
Yeah, Galaxy, what do you think about that?

745
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,940
Take that gun and you eat it!

746
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,000
You eat it!

747
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,600
Yeah!

748
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,580
Yeah, that was a close one for you.

749
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,020
What is it?

750
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,880
Queen's table.

751
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,420
Gosh.

752
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,460
What happened to the eye?

753
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,740
You know, I had a close incident with death.

754
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,880
And it left me dead.

755
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,120
It left me dead.

756
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,200
No!

757
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,440
You're a liar!

758
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,580
Oh, sorry.

759
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,800
You'll live.

760
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,680
You'll live.

761
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,440
You'll live.

762
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:48,940
See?

763
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,980
I told you.

764
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,740
Good.

765
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,000
I had a really bad hand.

766
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,880
I would have been a liar.

767
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,260
Ace's table.

768
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,250
Hmm...

769
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,090
How'd you know?

770
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,210
How'd you know?

771
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,850
How'd you know?

772
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,110
Two aces.

773
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,570
Two aces.

774
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,070
Two aces.

775
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,850
Two aces.

776
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,730
One ace.

777
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,070
Not me.

778
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,110
One ace.

779
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,250
Gaslight them with the voice callouts.

780
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,150
Wait, what's that?

781
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,290
What do you mean wrong?

782
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,130
Oh, if I say one queen.

783
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:53,710
Just kidding.

784
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,330
It's an ace.

785
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,350
I don't know.

786
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,610
I don't know.

787
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,750
You gotta be really lucky to have that many aces.

788
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,970
It's... Oh my god!

789
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:12,590
See?

790
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,350
I told you!

791
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,770
Eat it, Galaxy.

792
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,510
Eat it.

793
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,330
Eat it.

794
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,610
Eat it!

795
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:19,970
Ah!

796
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,420
Get better streamer luck, I guess.

797
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,820
Queen's table.

798
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,460
You're gonna throw for me, right?

799
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,460
You're gonna throw, right?

800
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,300
Yes!

801
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,120
Ok, I'm gonna call you.

802
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,460
Should I call you a liar then?

803
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,320
Yes?

804
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,740
Ok.

805
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,420
Liar!

806
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,150
You'll live.

807
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:07,510
It's ok.

808
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:07,870
You'll live.

809
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,210
You got this.

810
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,490
How did I...

811
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,670
Thank you guys!

812
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,290
Thank you guys!

813
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,090
Please leave and then... Oh here I can boot them.

814
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:40,830
Thank you!

815
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,670
I want to be a piggy.

816
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,130
How do I be a pig?

817
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:45,630
There we go.

818
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,310
Don't forget to check your emails.

819
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,110
Thank you!

820
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,870
I didn't get it.

821
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:55,970
Hello, hello, hello.

822
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,290
It's the same lobby ID so if anybody wants to join...

823
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,340
Never punished.

824
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,420
Never punished.

825
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,320
Hello!

826
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,920
Welcome.

827
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,280
He threw not for honor, but for you.

828
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,680
To mute?

829
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,300
Thank you!

830
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,880
I have to do it every time?

831
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,860
Welcome everybody.

832
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:23,460
Welcome.

833
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,780
Please stop watching stream.

834
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,800
There we go.

835
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,820
Be the bunny.

836
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,460
What's good about the bunny?

837
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,820
Cupcake?

838
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,080
Ok, I'll be the hot bunny.

839
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,820
Waiting on you onion.

840
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,760
Ready up.

841
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,180
Ready up.

842
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,800
Ready up.

843
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,140
Oh and look down?

844
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,600
Ok.

845
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,420
Alright, hold on.

846
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,940
I'm turning off sound.

847
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,920
There we go.

848
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,160
Aw, they didn't talk at all though.

849
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:07,720
So nice.

850
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,800
Look down?

851
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,280
I like the view.

852
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,420
You're my best view.

853
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,920
Does this make me a furry or...

854
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,460
It's a...

855
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,040
Welcome guys.

856
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,660
Welcome.

857
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,640
Howdy y'all.

858
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,860
Howdy, howdy.

859
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,400
One queen.

860
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,020
It's a queen.

861
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,600
Oh, it's me.

862
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,180
Two queens.

863
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,000
Two queens.

864
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,460
We got onion, Lakery, Tama.

865
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,000
Very good.

866
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,780
Very good.

867
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,700
Really?

868
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,480
Are you guys actually throwing down two queens?

869
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,420
That's a lot to throw down in the first round.

870
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,220
I'm just saying.

871
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,560
You're looking awfully suspicious.

872
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,560
Oh, you're looking everywhere?

873
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,200
I don't know.

874
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,900
Looking awfully suspicious.

875
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,260
Lakery.

876
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,780
I knew it!

877
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,740
You're a liar!

878
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,320
Sorry.

879
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,280
You'll survive.

880
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,260
Onion, you'll survive.

881
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,220
You'll survive.

882
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:39,540
See?

883
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,760
I told you.

884
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,740
Honest sampling.

885
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,000
Welcome to Bamboo Chef.

886
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,120
Thank you!

887
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,100
It's another queen's table.

888
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,500
OK The goats that sold the wisps.

889
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,080
One queen.

890
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,540
Oh, I'm in a different position now.

891
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh my gosh, I get to see a monkey.

892
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,480
One queen.

893
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,340
Hey, MintedChat just got home from the vet.

894
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,280
No, Wispu.

895
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,540
No, I'm so sorry.

896
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,140
I'm so sorry.

897
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,260
Hope everything is OK.

898
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,600
One queen.

899
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,340
I'm a truther.

900
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,280
Don't shake your head.

901
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,780
What are you talking about?

902
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,980
What about you?

903
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,380
Are you a liar?

904
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,080
What is that?

905
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:46,720
Is that a queen?

906
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,200
Oh, Lakery.

907
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,260
What?

908
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,320
You lived.

909
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,240
You lived.

910
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,000
It's fine.

911
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:00,980
Everything is good.

912
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,700
Everything is fine.

913
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,680
I hope your puppy gets better soon.

914
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,720
Ace's table.

915
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,780
Ace's table.

916
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,040
You know what?

917
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,140
You are all aces.

918
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,720
Are you guys talking to each other?

919
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,200
No, why not?

920
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,240
Guys, we are throwing down a big move here.

921
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,020
I'm playing big.

922
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,840
I'm playing big tonight.

923
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,940
Oh, am I?

924
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,480
They could conspire against me.

925
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,400
That's so true.

926
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,440
Oh my god!

927
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,780
His first shot!

928
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,980
Tama, you barely got to play!

929
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,220
What is it?

930
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,900
A king's table?

931
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:20,320
OK.

932
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,540
One king.

933
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,660
One king.

934
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,100
I'm playing big tonight.

935
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,110
Three kings.

936
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,290
You're pushing your luck.

937
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:40,990
Liar.

938
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,730
Look, I was going to do three kings, but then I changed my mind, OK?

939
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,310
Tama, I didn't think you would call me out.

940
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,410
I'm fine though.

941
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,540
Never mix.

942
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,280
But why?

943
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,500
So that I would have a king for later, duh.

944
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,200
Like a real king.

945
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,320
Oh, it's an ace's table.

946
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:10,940
OK, it's me.

947
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,120
I'm up.

948
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,560
Actually...

949
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,360
Jokers are wild cards.

950
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:18,940
Yeah, I know.

951
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,580
Thank you.

952
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,960
Three aces?

953
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,720
I don't know.

954
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,540
Never punished.

955
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,140
Two aces.

956
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,780
I'm playing it safe guys.

957
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,460
I'm playing it safe.

958
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,840
Maybe I should have called him.

959
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,340
Next one I'm going to call him.

960
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,480
It's good.

961
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,300
What?

962
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,920
I'm not a liar.

963
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,620
I'm a truther.

964
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,520
See?

965
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,240
Tsk, tsk.

966
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,740
You'll be OK.

967
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,160
See?

968
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:08,760
You're fine.

969
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,620
Another ace.

970
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,180
OK.

971
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,540
I want to try one and see what the dice one is like.

972
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,260
OK guys.

973
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,320
Alright boys.

974
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,180
OK boys.

975
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,740
Are you going to be truthful?

976
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,740
Three aces.

977
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,800
Really?

978
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,520
Is it real?

979
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,540
Is it real?

980
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,220
No.

981
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:47,720
No.

982
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,600
No.

983
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,340
What do you think Lekri?

984
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:51,960
Should I do it?

985
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,400
Should I call?

986
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:54,700
No?

987
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:56,960
Why not?

988
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,300
I'm going to call.

989
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,240
Liar.

990
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,140
Liar!

991
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,700
What?

992
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,160
Lekri you would have had me.

993
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,440
You would have had me dead.

994
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,100
We'll get him next time boys.

995
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,540
Literally all three cards were bad.

996
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,160
All three of them.

997
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,640
OK I like how the bear is just watching.

998
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,700
It's kind of freaky.

999
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,300
Dice has no revolver.

1000
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,680
Not an Ocelot approved game.

1001
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,020
Mmm

1002
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:06,030
OK Wait, three?

1003
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,870
Did you just put down three?

1004
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,870
Why did you do that?

1005
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,810
Are you being for real this time?

1006
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,050
A hundred percent?

1007
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,030
I don't know.

1008
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,990
You smell like a bacon.

1009
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,830
What are you shaking your head for?

1010
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,670
You're saying you're not telling the truth?

1011
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,350
Liar.

1012
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,170
Let's see.

1013
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:33,410
Oh damn.

1014
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,070
Why did you say you weren't telling the truth then?

1015
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:40,030
If I die here I'll come back and haunt you!

1016
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,350
I swear to God!

1017
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,090
I swear to God I'll be back!

1018
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,130
I'm back.

1019
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,760
Anyway...

1020
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,000
Aces table.

1021
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,780
Alright.

1022
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,740
Oh, this is my turn.

1023
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,120
Two Aces.

1024
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,200
Was it really?

1025
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,580
Lekri, do you think he's telling the truth?

1026
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,080
No?

1027
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,540
Liar.

1028
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,780
Let's see.

1029
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,660
Oh damn.

1030
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,800
What the hell Lekri?

1031
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,240
You!

1032
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,600
You betrayed me!

1033
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,160
Lekri, I swear to God!

1034
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,580
If I die here, if I die here, you will never...

1035
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,340
You will never stop hearing my name!

1036
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,040
Oh, I'm fine.

1037
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:38,480
Nevermind.

1038
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:38,820
Okay.

1039
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:52,970
Anyway.

1040
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,510
Queens table.

1041
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:55,330
Nice.

1042
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,550
Wait.

1043
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:57,330
Oh, there we go.

1044
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,030
I was not on the right keys.

1045
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,290
Three Queens.

1046
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,290
Can you only throw three as a...

1047
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,030
It's legit, I promise.

1048
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,070
Is three the max you can throw?

1049
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:15,270
One Queen.

1050
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,090
Three is the max.

1051
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,590
Okay.

1052
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,510
Three Queens.

1053
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,070
Really?

1054
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:26,930
Really?

1055
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,090
You want me to just call you a liar, huh?

1056
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,530
Because you want me to haunt you, huh?

1057
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,590
Yeah, I know how it is.

1058
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,650
You want me to die?

1059
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,850
I have just three bullets left.

1060
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,490
Don't look away like a sad puppy.

1061
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:39,530
Excuse me.

1062
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,580
Liar.

1063
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,780
I have no words here.

1064
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,680
If I die, I kind of deserve this.

1065
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,200
Goodbye!

1066
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,900
Oh, nevermind.

1067
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:16,690
Baby!

1068
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:19,770
It feels good to be king.

1069
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,150
One King.

1070
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,490
Is it even loaded?

1071
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,170
It sure is.

1072
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:32,870
What?

1073
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,230
Someone's got a death wish.

1074
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:38,250
What?

1075
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,750
You are really trying to...

1076
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,830
You can't keep doing...

1077
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:45,410
You can't... You keep making me...

1078
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:49,450
I'm not going to... I can't keep dying.

1079
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,670
What do I do, guys?

1080
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,750
I feel like he's...

1081
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,570
Call their bluff.

1082
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,310
He's lying.

1083
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:06,490
Liar.

1084
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,050
I hate this game.

1085
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,510
I hate this game.

1086
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,170
You know what, LightCrate?

1087
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:14,950
You are the one that lied.

1088
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:15,910
Don't look away.

1089
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,030
Watch as I die.

1090
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,130
My blood is on your hands.

1091
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:20,430
Watch me die!

1092
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:21,050
Oh, nevermind.

1093
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:21,790
OK, I'm fine.

1094
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,160
If I do three, they will definitely call me out.

1095
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,980
One Queen.

1096
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,580
One Queen.

1097
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,760
One Queen.

1098
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,460
One Queen.

1099
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,020
Ah, man.

1100
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,340
What?

1101
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,700
Someone's got a death wish.

1102
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,920
Oh, so maybe your first hand was a lie, huh?

1103
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,120
It was?

1104
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:08,900
Oh my gosh.

1105
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,640
He's admitting to being a liar.

1106
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,540
Armin, can you believe that?

1107
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,200
Liar.

1108
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,580
Uh oh.

1109
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:18,880
Sorry.

1110
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,080
You'll survive though.

1111
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,160
You'll survive, probably.

1112
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,880
You'll survive.

1113
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,300
You got this.

1114
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,500
See you on the other side!

1115
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,220
Oh, nevermind.

1116
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:30,540
Just kidding.

1117
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,880
Survived the worst hand.

1118
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,580
Honestly, I lied the entire time.

1119
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,080
By the way, I lied the entire time that last round.

1120
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,960
Aces table.

1121
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,060
OK.

1122
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,800
Two Aces.

1123
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,400
You know what?

1124
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,860
I'll also throw down two Aces.

1125
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,900
Wait, really?

1126
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,180
That means you have four Aces.

1127
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,540
Did you actually...

1128
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:20,860
Really?

1129
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,040
I don't know.

1130
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,400
Should I...

1131
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,880
Should I call it?

1132
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,900
I think I'll die if I call it though, right?

1133
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah, I will.

1134
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,100
I think I gotta call it.

1135
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,600
You won't make a fool out of me!

1136
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,580
You won't make a fool out of me!

1137
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,260
No!

1138
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,660
My blood is on your hands!

1139
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,120
Look at me!

1140
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,320
Look at me as I die!

1141
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,160
Onion!

1142
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,980
Look at me as I die!

1143
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,400
Oh,

1144
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,620
I'm a ghost now.

1145
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,760
Oh my god!

1146
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,020
I can like zoom around.

1147
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,520
Oh my god.

1148
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,340
I hope nobody looks at my dead sexy body.

1149
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,920
Rip bozo.

1150
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,820
No, you're supposed to be on my side!

1151
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,560
Wait, they can still hear me?

1152
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,320
Liar!

1153
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,040
Hey!

1154
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,180
Hey, guys!

1155
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,380
I can make this game.

1156
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,400
I can make this...

1157
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,760
Oh, you're gonna die.

1158
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,160
You're gonna die, Onion.

1159
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,120
This is it.

1160
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,400
See you in hell.

1161
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,340
I'm dragging you down here with me!

1162
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,340
I could just be a little...

1163
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,220
Ask them questions?

1164
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,300
Like what?

1165
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,920
I warned her too!

1166
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,620
What do you mean you warned me?

1167
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,160
You...

1168
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,760
You could've been lying!

1169
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,060
How am I supposed to know?

1170
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,320
Oh, they don't show you the cards?

1171
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,140
That's so funny.

1172
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,220
Oh!

1173
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,740
What am I doing over here?

1174
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,560
I'm at the monkey!

1175
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,360
You can bully me later.

1176
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,380
How do I get back over there?

1177
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,040
Excuse me?

1178
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,760
I'm trapped all the way.

1179
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,720
How do I move back to the table?

1180
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,860
I'm trapped at the monkey!

1181
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:18,940
Help!

1182
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,080
I'm trapped at the monkey!

1183
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,540
How do I go back to the table?

1184
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,280
How do I... I can't see your game!

1185
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,260
Oh my god!

1186
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:26,580
Wait!

1187
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,940
I'm at the bear!

1188
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:29,740
Oh my god.

1189
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,700
Wait, how do I get back to the table, please?

1190
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,320
You're fine.

1191
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,340
Can you tell me now?

1192
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,500
I'm trapped over here.

1193
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,100
I can't get away from the monkey.

1194
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,500
Please help me!

1195
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,540
Help me!

1196
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,320
I made it back.

1197
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,300
No thanks to you guys.

1198
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:45,960
Ok, just kidding.

1199
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,300
We're fine.

1200
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,040
I'm fine.

1201
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,280
Liar!

1202
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,260
Liar!

1203
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:07,820
Liar!

1204
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,520
Liar!

1205
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,840
I don't know if they... Can they still hear me?

1206
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,300
This was a message from the beyond!

1207
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,240
The ghost of Christmas future!

1208
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,720
Oh wait, no.

1209
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,220
Christmas past!

1210
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,880
I wouldn't know.

1211
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,520
Email alarm.

1212
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,160
Thank you!

1213
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,540
Still haven't gotten anything.

1214
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:56,040
So then, oh, if I go all the way over here, then I go to here, then I go to here, then I go back to the table.

1215
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,460
I figured it out, you guys.

1216
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,040
It says it in the top right.

1217
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,640
She was playing a ghost trick.

1218
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,200
Hurry it up and die already.

1219
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,260
I want the next game.

1220
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,700
This is so sad.

1221
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,860
I can't believe this is Zootopia 2, you guys.

1222
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:30,110
Now we have to see who wins.

1223
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:30,430
Who wins?

1224
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:38,750
How about you play where you always say the person is a liar.

1225
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:40,990
Whoever's turn it is.

1226
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,490
Always say that the other person is a liar.

1227
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:52,530
That means...

1228
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:57,710
Oh my god.

1229
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,530
Wait, how many does...

1230
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,690
Oh, 4 out of 6.

1231
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,460
I'm kind of mad that Onion won.

1232
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,960
I died because of you!

1233
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,080
Thanks for the game!

1234
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,540
Thank you guys for the game.

1235
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,940
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1236
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:31,880
Nice.

1237
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,200
Sexy bunny.

1238
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,020
Just kidding.

1239
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,180
Nice, nice, nice.

1240
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,480
Welcome in.

1241
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,820
Welcome in.

1242
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,780
Ready up and stop watching stream.

1243
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,960
It's my birthday, Gordon Freeman!

1244
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,580
Happy birthday!

1245
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,840
Happy birthday to you.

1246
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,920
Happy birthday to you.

1247
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,600
Happy birthday, Gordon Freeman.

1248
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,420
Happy birthday to you.

1249
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,800
Happy birthday!

1250
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,260
It is funny how many other people share your birthday.

1251
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,560
Alright, ready up!

1252
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,140
Ready up!

1253
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,240
Waiting on you Lumina.

1254
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,580
Lumina, Lumina, Lumina, Lumina, Lumina!

1255
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,560
GG's.

1256
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,340
Thanks for the game everyone.

1257
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:30,900
Onion!

1258
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,520
RIP Tava.

1259
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,600
I know, Tava died first try.

1260
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,400
So sad.

1261
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,700
Let's go!

1262
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,500
I turned off voices?

1263
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,600
Alright, we are good.

1264
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,340
Welcome to your doom!

1265
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,320
Ok, it's a King's table.

1266
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,800
Ok, hello.

1267
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,200
Oh, my turn too.

1268
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,900
King's table.

1269
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:20,540
You know guys, you are all Kings.

1270
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,960
Rob does not seem very impressed.

1271
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:26,700
Ok, nevermind.

1272
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,290
Two Kings, eh?

1273
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:35,790
Is that real?

1274
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,830
Yeah?

1275
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:41,510
You got the look of a liar, I'm just gonna say.

1276
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,690
I'm gonna call it.

1277
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:46,350
I'm gonna call you out!

1278
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:47,450
Yeah?

1279
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,630
Call you out?

1280
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:50,290
Ok.

1281
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,520
I knew it!

1282
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,300
I knew it, Rob!

1283
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,220
You'll win.

1284
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:09,410
I'm sorry!

1285
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,350
No!

1286
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,760
I'm so sorry.

1287
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,300
Rob!

1288
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,260
Oh dang it.

1289
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,380
I'm so sorry.

1290
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,500
I'm so sorry.

1291
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,240
I'm so sorry.

1292
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,800
I'm sorry.

1293
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,900
I'm so sorry.

1294
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,960
Am I now?

1295
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,160
Am I a liar?

1296
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,160
Oh, sevens.

1297
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,440
Surely two people can't die.

1298
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:15,680
See?

1299
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,260
We're fine.

1300
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,380
Yeah, see?

1301
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,220
We're fine, everybody.

1302
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:20,820
We're fine.

1303
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,360
Oh,

1304
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,440
my gosh.

1305
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,400
Queen's table.

1306
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,080
Queen's table.

1307
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,480
I think Mint is going to be haunted by all the people she killed in Ratwood.

1308
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,040
Knew I should have stayed on the pig!

1309
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,420
Oh, gosh.

1310
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,280
Ghost Secret Reaper.

1311
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,860
Oh, man.

1312
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,060
Is that really a queen now?

1313
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:00,920
Yeah?

1314
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,120
Yeah, really?

1315
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,380
Yeah, really?

1316
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:04,840
No?

1317
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,400
Am I lying now?

1318
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,100
Ackbar.

1319
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:18,700
Ackbar.

1320
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,840
You're going to be...you'll win!

1321
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,300
You'll win!

1322
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,060
You'll win!

1323
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,320
Oh, see?

1324
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,600
I gotta be careful about this guy.

1325
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,500
I gotta be careful about this guy.

1326
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,280
King's table, eh?

1327
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:39,790
Okay.

1328
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,150
Alright.

1329
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:47,090
Alright, guys.

1330
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:49,990
Two kings, eh?

1331
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:55,090
I shall also do one king.

1332
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:07,980
One king.

1333
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,560
Scared me.

1334
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,440
I was scared for a second.

1335
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,400
Actually, no.

1336
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:19,920
I'm going to do real.

1337
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,440
I feel like he might suss me out.

1338
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,520
Just kidding.

1339
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:26,660
Oh, really?

1340
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:28,660
Yeah?

1341
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:29,640
I don't know, Lumina.

1342
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,480
That's right.

1343
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,200
Tsk.

1344
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:35,480
Tsk.

1345
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:36,660
Tsk.

1346
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,860
Test your fate, Ackbar.

1347
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,100
This might be the fastest game ever.

1348
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,060
You got me.

1349
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:44,380
Oh, nevermind.

1350
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,080
You're fine.

1351
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,640
Streamer luck, probably.

1352
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,780
We're fine, everybody.

1353
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:56,660
Gosh.

1354
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,340
This is just so exciting, isn't it?

1355
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:02,200
Nice.

1356
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,080
Email good?

1357
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,740
Yeah, guys.

1358
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,160
It's okay.

1359
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,220
I checked it not too long ago.

1360
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,360
I checked it not too long ago.

1361
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,460
But thank you.

1362
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,020
Really, Lumina?

1363
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,020
Is that actually?

1364
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:20,800
Yeah?

1365
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:22,740
Really?

1366
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,700
100%

1367
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,100
I call liar.

1368
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,160
I can sniff him out.

1369
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,900
I smell your fear.

1370
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:40,140
But you'll win.

1371
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:40,700
It's fine.

1372
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,640
Close one.

1373
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,000
The taste of a liar.

1374
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,990
I don't like the way the bear is looking at us.

1375
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,270
You know?

1376
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:00,610
I don't like it.

1377
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:05,430
I will also do...

1378
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,650
two aces.

1379
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:11,310
I will also...

1380
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,070
Oh, nice.

1381
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:17,970
Really?

1382
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,310
So you had three, but you didn't put three down.

1383
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:23,130
Why is that?

1384
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,270
You're haunting the bear, Rob?

1385
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,010
Rob is haunting the bear for us, everybody.

1386
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,050
Don't look over there.

1387
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:33,670
Look at me, Lumina.

1388
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,810
Is that really 100%?

1389
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,750
If it is, jiggle your boob.

1390
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:42,510
Liar.

1391
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,460
You should have done it.

1392
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,120
You should have tickled the tit for me, Lumina.

1393
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,700
You should have tickled the tit.

1394
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,660
Oh, you got lucky.

1395
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:11,630
Let's see.

1396
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:12,770
King's table, eh?

1397
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:14,850
One king.

1398
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,470
I shall also do one king.

1399
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,390
One king.

1400
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,670
Two kings.

1401
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,270
Really now?

1402
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,310
100%?

1403
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,130
I don't know.

1404
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,390
What do you think, Lumina?

1405
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:41,170
Liar.

1406
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,190
Also, Franklin, thank you!

1407
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,410
I saw a bunch of...

1408
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:46,070
Oh, sorry.

1409
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:48,790
It was all you.

1410
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:51,250
I was asking what you thought.

1411
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,870
I didn't force your hand or anything.

1412
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:54,750
You got this.

1413
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:55,150
You'll win.

1414
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:55,410
See?

1415
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:55,830
There you go.

1416
01:13:58,430 --> 01:13:59,390
Thank you, Franklin.

1417
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,950
I saw people posting their Top Gaming Creators stuff.

1418
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,950
I see me in your list.

1419
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:05,570
Thank you guys.

1420
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:13,070
Nice!

1421
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,450
All in baby!

1422
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,710
What are you shaking your head for?

1423
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:25,010
Huh?

1424
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,530
What are you shaking your head for?

1425
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:30,370
What do you think?

1426
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,830
What do you think?

1427
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,770
Am I a liar?

1428
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,770
Am I now?

1429
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,940
You got this.

1430
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,360
If you become a ghost...

1431
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,380
Well, not if.

1432
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,140
Ghost Light.

1433
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,600
It's just you and me, Lumina.

1434
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,080
Yeah.

1435
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,440
Freak Phantom is at it again.

1436
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,300
What is it?

1437
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:10,820
Queen Sable?

1438
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:17,970
I will also do two.

1439
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:22,590
Yeah.

1440
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:26,210
What?

1441
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,570
No way.

1442
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,750
What?

1443
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,260
This is Lumina!

1444
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,980
Lumina, you knew!

1445
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,040
You knew!

1446
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:41,500
Lumina, if I dye my blood on your head, I will come back and I will never rest!

1447
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,040
Oh, I'm fine.

1448
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:42,540
Ok, nevermind.

1449
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,480
Oh my god!

1450
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,020
That was so big brained.

1451
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,940
That was so big brained.

1452
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,580
Wait, I only...Oh.

1453
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:56,480
Ok.

1454
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:56,960
No, no.

1455
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,440
I have a bunch of bullets left.

1456
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,240
We're fine, I think.

1457
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,360
Oh, King's Table.

1458
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:11,270
Really?

1459
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,410
Yeah?

1460
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,130
It's real?

1461
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,690
Why are you looking at your hand, huh?

1462
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:20,330
Looks like you're giving me the middle finger actually.

1463
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,130
Yeah, don't give me that!

1464
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,590
Um, actually...

1465
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,870
I'm gonna call you out.

1466
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,510
I'm gonna...Oh, dang it.

1467
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,550
Ok, um...

1468
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,640
Just another scarf for the collection.

1469
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,300
No!

1470
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,420
Oh my god.

1471
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:57,560
No!

1472
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,940
Thank you!

1473
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,760
Oh, bye Rob!

1474
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,360
There we go.

1475
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,240
I feel like I should have let Rob play another game.

1476
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,540
Pokerman.

1477
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,580
Welcome, welcome!

1478
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,240
Welcome.

1479
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,100
Pick up and stop watching stream.

1480
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:34,600
I did win the first match.

1481
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,120
But that was probably because they let me.

1482
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,500
Here we go!

1483
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,360
Just in case.

1484
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,880
There we go.

1485
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:54,680
Alright.

1486
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:57,740
Welcome in, welcome in!

1487
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,560
Beginner's luck?

1488
01:17:59,620 --> 01:17:59,900
No!

1489
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,460
It was normal luck.

1490
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,980
It was normal luck.

1491
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:08,380
Wait.

1492
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,200
King's table.

1493
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,570
So anybody got any kings?

1494
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:21,980
No?

1495
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:22,320
No?

1496
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:23,740
Oh my god.

1497
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,760
So everybody vote out Amulet.

1498
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,880
There we go.

1499
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,140
Alright.

1500
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:37,900
Wait, is that real?

1501
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,740
It is real.

1502
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,660
I think so too, Doge.

1503
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:46,900
I will do.

1504
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:57,720
Yeah.

1505
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:57,760
Yeah.

1506
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,600
It was real.

1507
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,500
Schrodinger's kings.

1508
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,920
Was that actually a king?

1509
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,040
Trash Hulk?

1510
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,980
If that's your real name.

1511
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,380
Okay.

1512
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,780
You seem pretty adamant.

1513
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,420
Two kings?

1514
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:29,480
I will also throw in two kings.

1515
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,320
I will also throw in two kings.

1516
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,880
What are you shaking your head for, eh?

1517
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,920
What are you shaking your head for, eh?

1518
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,900
Don't believe them Trash Hulk.

1519
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,240
Yeah.

1520
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,640
I wouldn't lie.

1521
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,520
I wouldn't lie.

1522
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:55,940
Oh really?

1523
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:57,760
Was it really?

1524
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,380
Thank god we didn't get to my round.

1525
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,820
You're okay Amulet.

1526
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:06,820
You'll win.

1527
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,460
You'll win.

1528
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,520
You got this.

1529
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,280
What are you doing with that?

1530
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,840
Three in a row out on the first round!

1531
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,340
How?

1532
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:44,500
No way!

1533
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,700
Do not sit at that chair.

1534
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,460
No, it was this chair before though.

1535
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:51,340
Really, Doge?

1536
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,200
Is that how you say your name, Doge?

1537
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,540
How do I say your name?

1538
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:58,840
Doge?

1539
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:00,880
Doge.

1540
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:02,800
Dog.

1541
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:04,980
Doge.

1542
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:06,900
Doge.

1543
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,340
None of those?

1544
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:13,980
King!

1545
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,460
King!

1546
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,400
Really?

1547
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,920
Trash, I told you I would never lie to you!

1548
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:24,800
Trash!

1549
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:25,960
I told you!

1550
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:26,600
What?

1551
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,420
You don't believe me?

1552
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,620
Trash, you don't believe me when I said I would never lie to you!

1553
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,600
I can't believe it.

1554
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:38,900
You...

1555
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,640
Baby, come on!

1556
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,400
Thanks for the five gifted thank you!

1557
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:48,160
Good thing I didn't put down a... Good thing I didn't lie!

1558
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,900
Let all three who died on the first round back for another round?

1559
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,540
I'll be ok with that.

1560
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:11,700
It's just I think each person would have... Everybody would have to allow them to go in, you know?

1561
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,680
Baby, come on!

1562
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:17,680
Thanks for the five more gifted!

1563
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,760
Thank you!

1564
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:20,760
Really?

1565
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,820
Ok.

1566
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,100
Ok.

1567
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,480
It's up to you, Doge.

1568
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,520
What do I do now?

1569
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,500
What were you gonna do otherwise?

1570
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,300
What do you do?

1571
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:03,020
Ok.

1572
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:05,060
You'll make it probably.

1573
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,900
Let's turn all these guys into bacon, you guys.

1574
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:18,680
But not me.

1575
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:19,740
I'm the better bacon.

1576
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,140
I mean I'm not bacon.

1577
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,620
What the heck?

1578
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,240
You guys have good hands?

1579
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,000
My hand is all queens, by the way.

1580
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,220
Really?

1581
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,120
Do you think I should call?

1582
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:51,800
No?

1583
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:56,000
I'm smelling a liar over there.

1584
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,300
I smell bacon.

1585
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:00,640
That means someone's pants are on fire.

1586
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,460
I think.

1587
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,260
I knew I smelled some bacon!

1588
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,720
Got him.

1589
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,360
We got him, boys.

1590
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,960
We got him, boys.

1591
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,120
King's table, eh?

1592
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,880
Ok.

1593
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,360
Alright.

1594
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:38,820
Make your move.

1595
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,880
You think this will work?

1596
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,840
Let's test our luck.

1597
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,220
You're pushing your luck.

1598
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,220
No way!

1599
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:03,780
I can't believe I got away with that.

1600
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,420
Oops!

1601
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,880
I'm on speaker.

1602
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:06,380
Oops!

1603
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:19,830
What happens now?

1604
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,490
I don't have any cards left.

1605
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:27,710
I want to see what happens.

1606
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,270
Oh, I guess we won't see.

1607
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,150
You're safe.

1608
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:31,750
Oh, that's it?

1609
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,350
Oh my god!

1610
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,550
Oh my god!

1611
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:38,070
How could you do this, Trash Hulk?

1612
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:39,470
How could you lie to us?

1613
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,010
We're your family!

1614
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,590
We're your family!

1615
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,530
Oh, just kidding.

1616
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:45,490
You're fine.

1617
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:52,610
I'm alive.

1618
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,170
Are you ok in there?

1619
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,910
Oh, I just saw a doge.

1620
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,830
Like the doge beam.

1621
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:01,210
Oh, aces.

1622
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:02,450
Nice.

1623
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,810
Family?

1624
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,390
Yeah, we're family.

1625
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:10,430
Look at us.

1626
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,550
We're all the piggies.

1627
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:13,210
We're the piggy family.

1628
01:26:20,110 --> 01:26:21,390
Is that real?

1629
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:24,890
For some reason I believe it.

1630
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:27,390
For some reason I believe it.

1631
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,700
For some reason I believe it.

1632
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,320
Oh come on.

1633
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:40,920
Why would I lie to...

1634
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:51,100
If I die here... If I die here you will have never ending suffering for the rest of your piggy life!

1635
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:56,540
This is so unfair.

1636
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,560
No!

1637
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,800
You should never call me a liar!

1638
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,000
If I die I'm not in the game anymore!

1639
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:20,850
Liar!

1640
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:21,870
Liar!

1641
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,090
Trash Hulk!

1642
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:26,550
You will suffer.

1643
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,430
Show me your hand.

1644
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,470
Show me your hand, Trash Hulk.

1645
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,550
He's got nothing!

1646
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:34,430
Doge!

1647
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:35,510
He's got nothing!

1648
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:37,690
He's got nothing.

1649
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:39,450
He's a complete utter liar.

1650
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,030
November 9th is 9 months away from February.

1651
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:46,010
So if your birthday is in November, congrats!

1652
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:48,230
You exist because your parents got freaky on Valentine.

1653
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,090
That's why there's so many.

1654
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:52,670
Yeah!

1655
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:53,750
Take him down!

1656
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:54,670
Take him down!

1657
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:59,110
Mission failed.

1658
01:27:59,470 --> 01:27:59,750
No!

1659
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:01,650
Never be game over.

1660
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:04,350
Oh my gosh.

1661
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:06,810
Trash Hulk has just as much luck as me.

1662
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:18,600
Email.

1663
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:20,360
I'm checking.

1664
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:23,840
Nope.

1665
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,460
Hold on.

1666
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,400
Actually, let me check on the... I'm gonna open up the actual...

1667
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,560
Wow, so fast.

1668
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:34,320
I'm gonna open it up on my computer instead of checking my phone.

1669
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:37,480
Ok.

1670
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:41,840
Now I have it open, so if it comes in... Wait.

1671
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,380
If it comes in, then I'll know.

1672
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,940
I'll see it immediately.

1673
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,500
So I don't have to keep checking my phone.

1674
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,080
It's gonna be haunting all of chat.

1675
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:54,980
I know.

1676
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,240
Join us.

1677
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,900
Join us.

1678
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,760
Come to the land...

1679
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,200
Oh my God.

1680
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,460
I don't want Trash Hulk to win.

1681
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,140
I don't want you to win!

1682
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,060
No!

1683
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:14,480
You have to live!

1684
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,400
Doge!

1685
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:16,980
Ok, thank God.

1686
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:24,080
No more reminders needed.

1687
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,840
Yeah, no more reminders needed.

1688
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:26,860
But thanks guys.

1689
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:31,780
Death.

1690
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,180
Death.

1691
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:32,680
Death.

1692
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,160
Death.

1693
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:33,700
Death.

1694
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:34,160
Death.

1695
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,220
This is a death threat.

1696
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,500
This is a real death threat.

1697
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,100
Death.

1698
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:37,800
Death.

1699
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,060
The grudge is strong.

1700
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,960
Well, it's 4 out of 6.

1701
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,400
3 out of 6.

1702
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,560
Oh, actually this is probably a better view, huh?

1703
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,020
We can see... We can even see Mr. Bear.

1704
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,560
Curse you.

1705
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,080
Curse you.

1706
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:04,600
Yeah!

1707
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:05,880
Call him a liar.

1708
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:06,840
Call him a liar.

1709
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:07,380
Yeah!

1710
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,520
Call him a liar!

1711
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,340
Join me in Amulet.

1712
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:14,380
Join us.

1713
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,580
Join us.

1714
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,620
Join us.

1715
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,440
No way.

1716
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,500
Doge, next one is his turn to die.

1717
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,140
Get him out!

1718
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,880
No way!

1719
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,840
How is this guy still alive?

1720
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,120
He beat the 50-50.

1721
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,260
But it's the next one!

1722
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:46,050
I'm scared.

1723
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:49,090
He got my first game luck.

1724
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:49,830
For real!

1725
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:50,430
Oh no.

1726
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:54,530
Doge!

1727
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:55,890
Doge!

1728
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:57,370
Doge!

1729
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:02,490
Welcome

1730
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:09,810
to the Ghost Realm, Trash Hulk!

1731
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:20,220
GG's

1732
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,840
Thank you guys for playing.

1733
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:30,400
Thank you.

1734
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,240
Thank you.

1735
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:31,880
Thank you.

1736
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,620
What is... What's the devil rule set?

1737
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,960
What's the devil rule set?

1738
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:45,840
Devil time?

1739
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,300
Liar's dice?

1740
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,280
I want to try liar's dice.

1741
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,400
I just want to play this one a little bit more.

1742
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,200
Devil is crazy.

1743
01:31:58,900 --> 01:31:59,720
The fun version.

1744
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,920
Alright guys.

1745
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:03,780
Thanks Rinto.

1746
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,740
Thanks Doge!

1747
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,300
Welcome.

1748
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,160
Welcome Rai Bread.

1749
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,240
Masuka and Veeja.

1750
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,960
Ready up and pig up.

1751
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,760
Liar's dice is less fun?

1752
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,120
Well, I still want to try.

1753
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,800
How am I supposed to know what it is if I don't try it?

1754
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:28,540
I still want to try it though.

1755
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,640
Pig up.

1756
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:31,940
Pig up.

1757
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:33,260
Alright.

1758
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,200
Let's go.

1759
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,640
What is this version?

1760
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,580
I do not know.

1761
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:52,240
Sorry, I forgot.

1762
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:54,600
There we go.

1763
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,560
What's the difference?

1764
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,420
Queen's table?

1765
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,080
Wait, what's that?

1766
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,560
What did that mean?

1767
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,540
In devil there is a red card.

1768
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,680
If someone calls liar on it, everyone takes a shot.

1769
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,600
Oh, I see.

1770
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:19,940
Devil card.

1771
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:22,500
Really?

1772
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,060
Took a long time to think about that.

1773
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,700
Is it a red card?

1774
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,780
It is?

1775
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,580
So if I call you a liar, everyone takes a shot?

1776
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,560
Do you want to take a shot?

1777
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,540
Everyone want to take a shot?

1778
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,200
No?

1779
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,100
Are you sure?

1780
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:41,860
Okay.

1781
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,220
Shots!

1782
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:50,660
Shots!

1783
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,020
Shots!

1784
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:51,360
Shots!

1785
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:51,620
Shots!

1786
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:51,940
Shots!

1787
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:52,380
Shots!

1788
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:52,760
Shots!

1789
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,280
Shots!

1790
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:54,740
Shots!

1791
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,060
Shots!

1792
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:55,380
Shots!

1793
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,220
Shots!

1794
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:56,440
Everybody!

1795
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,300
Is that the red queen?

1796
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:08,640
No.

1797
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,100
Alright, don't call it then VEGIE.

1798
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:12,720
Or maybe.

1799
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:13,420
I don't know.

1800
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,720
I'm scared.

1801
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,100
I'm going to play it safe.

1802
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,420
One queen.

1803
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,780
They are playing carefully.

1804
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:30,400
They are.

1805
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:31,620
What?

1806
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,540
What are you looking at me for?

1807
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,280
Two queens.

1808
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,260
Liar.

1809
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,000
A Buddha?

1810
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,340
Rye bread.

1811
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,100
Rye bread!

1812
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,080
Rye bread!

1813
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,100
This one is for you darling.

1814
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,680
This bread is moldy.

1815
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:55,660
Oh, just kidding.

1816
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:56,840
You are still fine.

1817
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,760
Queens at table.

1818
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,820
Brian, thanks for the super chat by the way.

1819
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,740
Is that the red queen?

1820
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:23,840
No.

1821
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:24,840
Dang.

1822
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,880
Is that the red queen?

1823
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:33,460
No.

1824
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,430
I wish I had the red queen though.

1825
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:43,390
Why are you looking at me?

1826
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:45,710
Why are you looking at me like that?

1827
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:46,910
Stop staring.

1828
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:50,470
Wow, I got away with that.

1829
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:50,570
What?

1830
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:58,170
Sometimes it's good to take bold moves because they are too afraid to doubt it.

1831
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:05,290
I don't know.

1832
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,830
Is that real?

1833
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:10,050
Is that real?

1834
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:17,510
If I call liar, will you be...

1835
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,990
Why are you looking away?

1836
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:19,830
I'm over here.

1837
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:20,790
Look at me.

1838
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:21,610
Don't look at the bear.

1839
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:23,650
I know, you probably think he is sexy.

1840
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:24,790
But, come on.

1841
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:25,150
Hello.

1842
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,690
See, I'm also scared.

1843
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,760
I'm also scared to take a risk.

1844
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:41,240
Alright.

1845
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,060
Nobody is calling out.

1846
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,480
What?

1847
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:52,860
What?

1848
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:52,860
Seriously?

1849
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,020
I think you are a liar.

1850
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,140
Yippee

1851
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:02,980
buddy!

1852
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,260
Oh my gosh.

1853
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,080
It's time for all of us to have a little treat.

1854
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:07,300
Treat!

1855
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:21,690
Oh my gosh, I should have called it out before.

1856
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:23,110
Three hand.

1857
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:24,670
That was crazy.

1858
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:25,370
Kings?

1859
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:37,290
I want the red card so bad.

1860
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:44,590
Two kings.

1861
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,290
Is that right, bro?

1862
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:49,230
Is that real?

1863
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:50,250
Is that real?

1864
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:52,950
I don't know, VJ.

1865
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:55,310
I don't know.

1866
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:55,990
I'm just saying.

1867
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,110
I'm smelling bacon is all.

1868
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,790
Okay, you're not, you're not, you're not.

1869
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,270
Okay, that's fine.

1870
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:04,130
You don't believe me.

1871
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:04,690
You don't trust me.

1872
01:38:04,730 --> 01:38:05,150
That's fine.

1873
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:06,570
I'm a truther, you know.

1874
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:11,030
This place is called Liar's Bar, but I'm the only little bit of truth in here.

1875
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:14,730
And I'm gonna lie right now.

1876
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:30,070
One king?

1877
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:36,030
I wanna see.

1878
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:37,730
What?

1879
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:40,370
Why would you tell the truth?

1880
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:42,070
This is the Liar's Bar.

1881
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:44,370
VJ, VJ, I can't die.

1882
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:45,850
I can't be the first one to die.

1883
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:47,470
VJ, VJ, I can't be the first one to die.

1884
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:47,910
VJ!

1885
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:48,890
Okay, I'm fine.

1886
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:51,270
Okay,

1887
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:10,580
I have a question.

1888
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:11,940
Wait, wait.

1889
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:14,840
I have a question.

1890
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,960
If I put down...

1891
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,260
So, the ace has to be...

1892
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:22,960
The ace, the red ace has to be...

1893
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:28,560
Like, what if I mix it in a bad hand?

1894
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:30,800
Oh, it has to be the only thing.

1895
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:31,440
Okay, okay.

1896
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,220
You can only put the devil card down alone.

1897
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:44,580
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

1898
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,480
I see, I see, I see.

1899
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,640
Why is everyone playing it so safe?

1900
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,220
Why are you guys playing it so safe?

1901
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,980
We are only playing one ace?

1902
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,860
Is this how we are playing the game now?

1903
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:03,920
Dang it!

1904
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:06,180
No!

1905
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,140
Why didn't you call it?

1906
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,180
Oh my god, rye bread!

1907
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,040
This bread has gone bad.

1908
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,380
It's gone stale.

1909
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:25,120
You're no pork sandwich.

1910
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,380
Or maybe you are.

1911
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:27,840
Porked!

1912
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:28,460
Nevermind.

1913
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,980
Okay, let's go baby.

1914
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:43,160
Ace's table.

1915
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:47,480
I've got an ace up my sleeve.

1916
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,740
I rigged it.

1917
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:52,180
I have all the aces.

1918
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,500
Everyone else is a liar.

1919
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,000
One ace.

1920
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:14,690
Yeah, I have really long sleeves.

1921
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:15,170
Exactly.

1922
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,770
What means something as a verb?

1923
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:20,470
What are you talking about?

1924
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:26,150
One ace.

1925
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:28,410
Stop just doing ones!

1926
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:30,370
Take more risks!

1927
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:32,030
I'm gonna take a big risk, okay?

1928
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:33,030
I'm gonna take a big risk.

1929
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:36,870
Two aces.

1930
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,170
Am I lying?

1931
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:40,890
I might be.

1932
01:41:42,650 --> 01:41:43,830
You'll never know.

1933
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,350
Come on, call me out.

1934
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:49,650
You have to call me out sometimes.

1935
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:52,430
Okay, you have to call...

1936
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:55,390
Sorry, I was being honest there though.

1937
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,090
I didn't mean like at this moment.

1938
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:59,710
I meant like you have to call me out sometimes in the game.

1939
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:02,110
You can't just not call me out ever.

1940
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,070
You'll be fine.

1941
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:06,810
See?

1942
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:15,950
Are you guys talking to each other in the voice chat?

1943
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:16,050
What?

1944
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:18,830
Why not?

1945
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:20,810
Why don't you guys be friends?

1946
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:24,370
Alright.

1947
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:26,570
I've got an ace up my sleeve.

1948
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:27,510
I mean, wait.

1949
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:31,730
Thank you!

1950
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,610
Thank you!

1951
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:37,590
GGs.

1952
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,490
I need to have my mic plugged in.

1953
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:40,510
Oh, okay.

1954
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:42,430
You should plug in your mic.

1955
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:43,590
Oh my gosh, so fast!

1956
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:44,390
Liar!

1957
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:48,270
Fiji is all seeing.

1958
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,550
How the hell did you know that?

1959
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:53,750
Rye bread, become sourdough!

1960
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:56,950
Just kidding.

1961
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:59,030
My hand is bad.

1962
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,060
Alright.

1963
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:12,200
It's an aces...

1964
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,920
It's an aces table, eh?

1965
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,980
What is friend?

1966
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:22,740
They responded!

1967
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:24,260
Oh my gosh, thank God!

1968
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:26,820
I got the email you guys!

1969
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,040
I got the email.

1970
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:32,240
Is that real?

1971
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,440
Come on Mask!

1972
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,820
You have to call me out sometimes!

1973
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:59,280
I wonder if he'll call me out now.

1974
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,560
You've got mail.

1975
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:11,900
Oh, do you?

1976
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:12,580
Wow.

1977
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:15,920
I think it's real.

1978
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:16,000
It's real.

1979
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,040
One ace,

1980
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,140
one ace.

1981
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:25,140
Everybody puts down one ace.

1982
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:29,160
Oh, except Mask puts down two!

1983
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,180
Wait, how did you call him a liar?

1984
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:35,640
Wait, how did you do that from across the table?

1985
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:38,800
Come on, you can only call out the person next to you.

1986
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:44,880
No!

1987
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:45,240
Mask!

1988
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,780
Oh, Rye is out of cards.

1989
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:52,740
I see, I see, I see.

1990
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:57,840
Mask...

1991
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,660
Ok, RyeBrady, you'll never call me... Actually, you've got to call me out sometimes, ok?

1992
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:07,670
Why are you shaking your head?

1993
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:09,410
Annyeong!

1994
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:11,150
Welcome to Mamba Show, Baku!

1995
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:15,370
It's now my turn.

1996
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:17,770
Hold on, I'm going to check my email while you take your turn.

1997
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:20,430
Ok.

1998
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:22,470
Ok, great.

1999
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:23,490
Ok.

2000
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:25,130
We're all good.

2001
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:28,730
Let me reply real quick.

2002
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:33,550
Hold on, I'm replying to my email.

2003
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:43,820
Is it my turn?

2004
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:45,020
No.

2005
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:51,920
Ok,

2006
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:00,400
I'm fine.

2007
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,340
Wait, I'm trying to write my emails here!

2008
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:05,900
lol

2009
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:28,450
Oh, is it my turn?

2010
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:32,890
Ok,

2011
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:36,550
hold on.

2012
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:37,570
I'm typing.

2013
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:47,830
Ok.

2014
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:48,710
Alright.

2015
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:49,430
Me!

2016
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:51,630
Alain Minto!

2017
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:53,870
Alain Minto!

2018
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,710
So what?

2019
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:05,320
Speed emailing.

2020
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:05,900
I sent my email.

2021
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:06,500
We're all good.

2022
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:08,920
I sent my email.

2023
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:09,740
We're good to go.

2024
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:12,400
I'm focused now.

2025
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,440
I'm focused on the game.

2026
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:14,040
I'm in the game.

2027
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:15,180
My mind is in the game.

2028
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:16,220
My mind is here.

2029
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:17,360
Nowhere else.

2030
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,720
I just felt like calling him out.

2031
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:32,140
See,

2032
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,920
I told you my mind was in the game.

2033
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:39,960
I also had a really bad hand.

2034
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:41,560
lol

2035
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:48,830
Aces table.

2036
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:53,970
Really?

2037
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:54,710
Is that real?

2038
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:56,610
No!

2039
01:47:57,530 --> 01:47:58,810
Should I call a liar?

2040
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,050
Do you have the red card?

2041
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:07,510
Really?

2042
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:09,770
I bet red only has two shots left.

2043
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:15,130
Guys, I want to use my red Ace.

2044
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,730
Let's see if Rybread calls it out.

2045
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:19,970
Call it out Rybread!

2046
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:20,590
Come on!

2047
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:21,310
Come on!

2048
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:22,650
I'm a liar.

2049
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:24,050
Dang it!

2050
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,930
Why does nobody ever call me out?

2051
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:32,370
I don't think that's real.

2052
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:42,050
You do it too early.

2053
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:43,630
Sometimes you have to fake them out.

2054
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,470
People do fake cards all the time.

2055
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:47,130
There is no method.

2056
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:49,390
There is no method.

2057
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:51,030
You just got to feel it.

2058
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:52,590
You got to feel it.

2059
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:56,790
You got to feel it.

2060
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,480
Don't think.

2061
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:06,460
Feel.

2062
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:07,800
Thank you.

2063
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:10,320
Top Cruz.

2064
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,420
Oh it's me.

2065
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:14,340
All in on Minto.

2066
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,260
Why are you shaking your head?

2067
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:25,720
Mask would have believed me.

2068
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:29,540
I told you Mask would have believed me.

2069
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,940
Rybread, Rybread, Rybread.

2070
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,020
Your sourdough.

2071
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,240
What?

2072
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:41,680
What?

2073
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:47,420
What is with all this streamer luck?

2074
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:49,620
This is unfair.

2075
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,760
Ace's table, eh?

2076
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,360
I'm so lucky.

2077
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,500
He's processed bread.

2078
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:06,420
That's why he's got a lot of preserves...

2079
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,540
Preservatives in him to keep him alive.

2080
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:16,140
Rybread, how many preservatives do you have in you to keep you alive like this?

2081
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,660
Why was he squinting at me like that?

2082
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:41,080
VJ.

2083
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,760
VJ, I swear to god.

2084
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,480
VJ, I'm going to die here.

2085
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,120
VJ!

2086
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:46,300
VJ.

2087
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:47,560
VJ!

2088
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,640
Fuck you!

2089
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,260
Fuck you!

2090
01:50:58,380 --> 01:50:59,180
It wasn't even...

2091
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:21,350
And then they are just going to keep on carrying...

2092
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:24,270
Keep on playing as if nothing ever even happened.

2093
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:29,230
Yeah, take him down.

2094
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:30,030
Take him down.

2095
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:30,830
Rybread!

2096
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:32,090
Actually, you know what?

2097
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:33,110
I want both of you to die.

2098
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:35,730
I want a double death.

2099
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:37,970
I want a double death.

2100
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:41,750
I want a double death.

2101
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:46,770
They can both go down because Rybread put that down knowing that I will die!

2102
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:53,500
Hurry it up.

2103
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:57,160
An even score?

2104
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,640
No, Rybread, you...

2105
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:01,100
No, it's not an even score.

2106
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,960
Rybread, you will be dead on the next shot.

2107
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,720
You have one more and VJ has two.

2108
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:08,200
What are you talking about?

2109
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,480
We are being haunted.

2110
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:24,080
That's what we call spearmint because she got shafted.

2111
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:25,380
Wait, what?

2112
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:32,920
Sayonara, Rybread.

2113
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:34,660
Your time has come.

2114
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:36,860
Donation for the Minto second funeral fund.

2115
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,480
Bye bye!

2116
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:45,990
Spear shaft?

2117
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,570
What's that?

2118
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,940
VJ the silly.

2119
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:54,680
GG!

2120
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:57,560
Bye!

2121
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:06,860
Thanks for having us.

2122
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:07,520
Thanks Rybread!

2123
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,400
Thank you, thank you!

2124
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:18,140
Is it OK if we try dice?

2125
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:23,590
Is it OK if we try dice?

2126
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:25,930
I can't play this game because I never...

2127
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:27,010
Here we...

2128
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:32,150
Is it OK if we try dice everybody?

2129
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:34,930
Welcome in, welcome in.

2130
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:38,650
Hi Minty, you are so cool.

2131
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:39,470
Thanks Jordan.

2132
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:44,270
I want to try the dice.

2133
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:47,290
Liar's dice, liar's dice.

2134
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:49,870
Liar's dice.

2135
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:04,930
Drink two bottles?

2136
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:05,930
All you do is drink?

2137
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:07,690
Minky!

2138
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:10,070
I don't get this one.

2139
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:15,550
You roll dice and then you have to guess how many dice are...

2140
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:17,590
How much the total is everywhere?

2141
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:20,770
Alright, let's try it.

2142
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:23,030
If we don't like it...

2143
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:25,690
If we don't like it, we'll switch it.

2144
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:27,390
Ready up!

2145
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:28,670
Minky.

2146
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:38,940
Let me know when to turn off stream.

2147
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,060
Now!

2148
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,400
Let's go.

2149
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,220
Don't be sorry, be glad.

2150
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:51,620
Thank you.

2151
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,060
Hold on, what was your...

2152
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:56,460
Hold on, I didn't see your super chat.

2153
01:54:57,740 --> 01:54:59,440
Thanks for having us Mint, sorry I got you killed.

2154
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:01,060
Are you though?

2155
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:01,940
Are you sorry?

2156
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:03,460
It's loading.

2157
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:09,020
You're guessing how many of a certain value, not total value.

2158
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:09,740
Oh, ok.

2159
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:14,100
I don't like that sound.

2160
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,360
Alright, welcome, welcome.

2161
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:21,160
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

2162
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,460
I guess I look at my dice.

2163
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:29,340
I can totally see his dice over there.

2164
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,060
I can see your dice.

2165
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,620
I can see your dice, Zazamos.

2166
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:38,720
I can see your dice.

2167
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:39,700
Lift it up, lift it up.

2168
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:44,320
Yeah.

2169
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:46,220
Wait, what?

2170
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:46,840
I'm confused.

2171
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:48,080
So I say...

2172
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,280
I say...

2173
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:55,260
So I guess the total number of...

2174
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:58,040
Of like 4's, I say like...

2175
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,700
I say like 5 4's, ok.

2176
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:05,580
5 4's.

2177
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:07,420
How is that lying though?

2178
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:09,140
Huh?

2179
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:14,940
Oh, it's guessing how many are in mine.

2180
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:16,940
Wait, huh?

2181
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,420
I can't decrease the number.

2182
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,240
Good.

2183
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,520
I was lying every time she asked...

2184
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,380
V.I.T.I.!

2185
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,200
What do you mean?

2186
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,760
Hey, what?

2187
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:30,600
I have no 4's.

2188
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:35,360
Wait, 3 4's, 4 4's.

2189
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:37,900
I'm poisoned?

2190
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,100
Oh, I thought we were drinking alcohol.

2191
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,480
Guys, everything is really hazy.

2192
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:44,800
Wait, my vision.

2193
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,300
You guys, I can't see very well.

2194
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,220
I can't count how many dice I have.

2195
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,240
My vision is wonky.

2196
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:50,960
This is this game.

2197
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,040
It's not my fault.

2198
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,060
Don't call me a liar, ok?

2199
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:54,520
Don't worry, you can't call me a liar.

2200
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:55,560
You said I was cool, ok?

2201
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,800
What are you shaking your head for?

2202
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:01,280
Hi, Zezimos!

2203
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,460
Yeah, no more poison for me.

2204
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,280
Wait, I'm still confused.

2205
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,340
I'm still confused how this works, you guys.

2206
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:21,000
I still don't understand how this works.

2207
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,260
I have 2 of them.

2208
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:29,360
6 5's?

2209
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:32,320
I don't think so.

2210
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,260
Starting out with a small number helps you.

2211
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,160
No, we have to make it big for them.

2212
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:53,210
Why would you tell them that?

2213
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:54,970
Because I don't understand this game!

2214
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:55,610
I don't understand the game yet!

2215
01:57:59,190 --> 01:58:00,750
Oh my god, froggy!

2216
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:02,030
Oh my god, don't take it!

2217
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:03,970
Froggy, froggy, can you see me?

2218
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:05,950
Froggy, how many fingers am I holding up?

2219
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:07,670
How many fingers am I holding up?

2220
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,390
Liar!

2221
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,170
Liar!

2222
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:11,190
Drink more poison.

2223
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:14,370
Oh my god, wait, there is blood trickling down your nose.

2224
01:58:14,910 --> 01:58:15,810
I mean your snout.

2225
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:16,830
Is that me too?

2226
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:17,930
Do I have blood on my face?

2227
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:20,450
Do I have blood?

2228
01:58:20,590 --> 01:58:20,750
Oh.

2229
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,030
This is rye bread.

2230
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:26,630
Sorry if my devil's hand got you out.

2231
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:28,190
Truth is that was my first game ever.

2232
01:58:28,430 --> 01:58:29,430
Oh my god!

2233
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:31,490
Thank you!

2234
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:36,290
I have no idea what he just said.

2235
01:58:37,130 --> 01:58:38,290
Sorry, I don't know what you said.

2236
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:39,330
I just wanted to call liar.

2237
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,730
Oh no!

2238
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:52,030
You got a little something on your snout.

2239
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:55,090
You have a bunch of dice in the table.

2240
01:58:55,410 --> 01:58:58,050
If you in your hand, you guess how many dice there is in the table that...

2241
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:00,490
That particular number.

2242
01:59:00,650 --> 01:59:03,390
You can't guess a lower quantity than the last.

2243
01:59:05,210 --> 01:59:07,170
Sorry if it's rude to send the second one.

2244
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,070
Oh it's your birthday!

2245
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:11,930
Because of you I was given Astro Bot.

2246
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:13,310
Oh my god!

2247
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:13,970
Lord!

2248
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:16,010
Lord Risenbolt, happy birthday!

2249
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:19,290
Happy birthday to you!

2250
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:22,390
Happy birthday to you!

2251
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:25,930
Happy birthday dear Lord Risenbolt!

2252
01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:30,730
Happy birthday to you!

2253
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:37,800
Oh no, I think I'm dead.

2254
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:40,420
Don't die!

2255
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:41,940
Sayonara!

2256
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:45,720
Oh nevermind, I'm dead.

2257
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,120
This one is kind of weird.

2258
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,060
I don't think this one...

2259
01:59:56,060 --> 02:00:00,520
Okay, I get what you guys mean about the... It's not as exciting, right?

2260
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:01,620
It's kind of weird, right?

2261
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:07,500
Also, don't worry.

2262
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:09,780
It's not rude to send the second one.

2263
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:11,580
Sorry I missed the first one.

2264
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:13,980
I'm sorry it felt like you had to send the second one, honestly.

2265
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:18,980
Sorry, I'm drinking my tea.

2266
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,100
There is no gambling thrill.

2267
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,100
It's like kind of, but I feel like it's too easy to call out liars, you know?

2268
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:31,300
This one has a lot of math and thinking involved.

2269
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:33,380
Join me!

2270
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,520
Join me!

2271
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:36,980
Join me!

2272
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,440
Why is my mouth flapping?

2273
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:41,180
Wait!

2274
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:42,280
Oh my god!

2275
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:43,260
My mouth!

2276
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:43,980
Wait!

2277
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:44,640
I'm talking!

2278
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:45,820
I'm dead!

2279
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:47,960
Is this supposed to happen?

2280
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:55,980
I'm a pig!

2281
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,200
I'm dead!

2282
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:01,960
I'm talking from the beyond!

2283
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,360
Is this annoying you guys?

2284
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:03,980
Sorry.

2285
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:06,300
I just think it's really exciting to see my mouth flap.

2286
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:08,580
You know?

2287
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,680
Aren't you a ghost?

2288
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,080
Yeah, but a ghost does not have a physical body.

2289
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:17,180
You do not get to see a physical body.

2290
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:20,300
Wait, like talking, you know?

2291
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:24,500
Zazamost, do you have your mic plugged in?

2292
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:26,280
You wanna talk too?

2293
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,020
Oh my gosh!

2294
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,920
Oh my gosh, it's anyone's game now.

2295
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,960
It could be noir or it could be froggy.

2296
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:33,680
Oh my god.

2297
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:37,000
Guessing high is lying because it's an informed guess.

2298
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:42,280
If you guess really high it implies you are confident because you have several ears.

2299
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:43,860
I see.

2300
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:44,100
I see.

2301
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:44,420
I see.

2302
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:47,220
Yeah, it does have a lot of thinking more in this one, right?

2303
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:57,860
I'm a better looking zombie than the zombie in the new Minecraft movie.

2304
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:02,720
Brains.

2305
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:03,180
Poison.

2306
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:06,100
I'm a zombie and I want poison.

2307
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:09,880
Four 3's?

2308
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:10,440
Come on!

2309
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:13,420
Four 5's?

2310
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,520
I don't think... Call him out!

2311
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,740
Call him out!

2312
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:17,560
Call him out noir!

2313
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:18,360
Call him out!

2314
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:18,860
Yeah!

2315
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,440
Call him out!

2316
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:20,040
Call him out!

2317
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:21,420
Yeah!

2318
02:02:31,050 --> 02:02:33,210
I love watching my piggy talk.

2319
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:34,990
Wait, this is the best part of the game.

2320
02:02:37,290 --> 02:02:37,930
You're welcome!

2321
02:02:38,110 --> 02:02:38,810
I got you noir!

2322
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:44,370
Yay!

2323
02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:46,610
That felt so short.

2324
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:50,750
I wish they'd make a movie version of Minecraft story mode.

2325
02:02:51,090 --> 02:02:54,110
Is there... There's kind of a story mode, right?

2326
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:57,530
There's kind of a story mode, right?

2327
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:03,030
Can't wait for the Minecraft movie watch along when it comes out.

2328
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:05,530
Do we have to?

2329
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:07,790
Shall we rotate?

2330
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:10,650
Yeah, I'll party out.

2331
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:11,390
I'll party out.

2332
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:15,650
Yeah, we... Oh, there we go.

2333
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:16,210
Thank you!

2334
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:16,790
Thanks noir!

2335
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:25,320
Oh, we're not doing... We're doing deck.

2336
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,680
We're doing devil deck.

2337
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:38,100
But if I'm a sexy bunny... If I'm Judy Blops, maybe you won't want to call me out, you know?

2338
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:42,380
Welcome everybody.

2339
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:43,920
Meals.

2340
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,020
Jack.

2341
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:46,160
Buglewup.

2342
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:48,120
Alright.

2343
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:56,580
No, it's like Blonic, but Judy Blops, you know?

2344
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,940
Ready up everybody, ready up.

2345
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:03,860
Judy Slops?

2346
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:13,330
If you're a bunny and drink the poison, your mascara runs?

2347
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:14,370
No way!

2348
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:16,210
No way!

2349
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:18,250
Alright, let's go everybody!

2350
02:04:22,510 --> 02:04:23,390
Waiting, waiting.

2351
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:29,740
Oh, I can just do this.

2352
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:30,160
Oh my god.

2353
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:34,240
I didn't know I could just turn it off and all like that.

2354
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:36,200
Thanks for the game, Minky.

2355
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,580
The poison made your eyes all super pretty.

2356
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:41,820
You too, Zazamos.

2357
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:46,960
Howdy boys.

2358
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:48,320
Howdy, howdy.

2359
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:50,140
I'm a sexy bunny.

2360
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:56,860
If you play your cards right, you might get a little bit of a rabbit's foot.

2361
02:04:58,300 --> 02:04:59,580
I heard it's lucky.

2362
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:02,900
Don't shake your head at that!

2363
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:04,360
Don't shake your head!

2364
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:07,140
Jack doesn't care, he's playing the game.

2365
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:07,180
He's playing the game.

2366
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:11,600
What?

2367
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:16,860
I didn't even get to use my devil's card.

2368
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:18,820
Nails.

2369
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,900
You were so close.

2370
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:23,140
Bring it on.

2371
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:33,460
When the game gets stressed...

2372
02:05:33,460 --> 02:05:35,560
Why do I keep biting my tongue recently?

2373
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:38,800
It sounds like I have a lisp because I'm like...

2374
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,100
I'm biting my tongue.

2375
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:43,600
I think Nails is calling you a liar.

2376
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:44,240
What did you have to say?

2377
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,020
What are you talking about?

2378
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:50,020
I've got an ace up my sleeve.

2379
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:52,380
Except I have no sleeves.

2380
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:55,780
I mean I have a queen.

2381
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:56,900
I'm the queen.

2382
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,620
I'm the queen.

2383
02:05:58,620 --> 02:05:58,840
You know?

2384
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:05,760
Do you think they like what I'm saying?

2385
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,400
Is that real?

2386
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:15,740
Is that real?

2387
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:16,560
No?

2388
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:20,840
You being real honest right now?

2389
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:25,420
Excuse me princess.

2390
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:26,420
You being honest right now?

2391
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:31,100
If you're a liar... Break your pinky promise.

2392
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:31,660
Break your pinky.

2393
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:35,840
Why is Bojack Horseman in the background?

2394
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:37,200
Oh wait.

2395
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:44,060
Why is Bojack Horseman playing knives in the background?

2396
02:06:48,070 --> 02:06:49,250
Oh it's a donkey?

2397
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,260
Why is it so quiet?

2398
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:58,460
Why is it so quiet?

2399
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:03,000
Jack, are you going to call me out sometimes?

2400
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:08,220
Yeah?

2401
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:09,820
OK, good.

2402
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:12,220
Oh my God!

2403
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:13,380
Oh my God!

2404
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:13,980
Oh my God!

2405
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,020
We have a liar at our table.

2406
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:15,840
Shoot!

2407
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:16,660
Shoot!

2408
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:17,600
Shoot!

2409
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:18,460
Shoot!

2410
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:21,660
What?

2411
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:38,070
I said shoot, but I didn't think you would take it.

2412
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:41,030
Oh my God.

2413
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:42,450
It's a king's table.

2414
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:48,590
But everybody... It's a king's table, but everybody knows the queen has all the power.

2415
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:52,950
He was still young.

2416
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:56,010
He was still young.

2417
02:07:58,010 --> 02:08:00,410
And now it's Alice in Wonderland.

2418
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:02,810
What are you talking about?

2419
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:14,800
What?

2420
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:16,900
Why are you staring at me like that?

2421
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,520
Why do you have such a smug look on your face, dog?

2422
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:24,940
Why is he staring at me like that?

2423
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:26,000
What?

2424
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,620
I played the queens.

2425
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:32,940
I better not die here.

2426
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:36,680
If I die here, I swear, I will be back.

2427
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,100
I have a body double!

2428
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:39,180
It's not the real me!

2429
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:57,620
What do you mean?

2430
02:08:57,860 --> 02:08:59,200
Yeah, I'm a noob.

2431
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:00,260
This is my first...

2432
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:08,000
You probably been stream sniping in everybody's... in everybody's streams, I bet!

2433
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,440
Oh my God!

2434
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:15,940
Another Metal Gear ref for the books.

2435
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:30,540
Stay mad!

2436
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,220
Get out of my...

2437
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:34,920
Bugle up!

2438
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:36,000
You gotta kill this guy!

2439
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:36,980
Kill him!

2440
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:38,560
Wait, don't kill yourself.

2441
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:39,260
No, don't!

2442
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:41,040
This is not the worst mistake I've made.

2443
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:42,120
Don't do it!

2444
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:02,740
How is it possible?

2445
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,140
How?

2446
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:05,600
Smell you later.

2447
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:07,100
I hate this guy!

2448
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,280
Oh my God.

2449
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:17,020
Oh my God.

2450
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:18,200
Later gator.

2451
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:20,280
Later gator.

2452
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:25,060
That was an aggressive route.

2453
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:28,160
Oh my God!

2454
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,340
I don't wanna be the bunny anymore.

2455
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:31,400
She's bad luck.

2456
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:32,760
Piggy all the way.

2457
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:37,580
Actually, I have the most best luck as the dog.

2458
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:39,140
I think I'm switching to the dog.

2459
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:44,220
Let me try being lucky.

2460
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,660
She got that dog in her.

2461
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:57,240
Ready up!

2462
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:03,740
How long has it been?

2463
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:08,160
Alright, let's go baby!

2464
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:11,740
The dog.

2465
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:12,200
The dog.

2466
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:12,620
The dog.

2467
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,160
The dog.

2468
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:14,180
The dog.

2469
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:14,960
The dog.

2470
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:15,420
The dog.

2471
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:16,020
The dog.

2472
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:20,760
Howdy boys.

2473
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:22,680
Wait, does my mouth move when I talk?

2474
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:25,340
It does!

2475
02:11:26,940 --> 02:11:28,320
Oh my gosh.

2476
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:33,040
Amazing round, Saucy Jack.

2477
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:36,700
Let's go baby.

2478
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:38,600
Let's go.

2479
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:39,540
Queen's table.

2480
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:42,780
Alright, alright, alright.

2481
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:43,240
Alright.

2482
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:47,220
Alright, alright, alright.

2483
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:50,580
Curry Ninja, you would never call me out, right?

2484
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:56,780
Why are you looking away, huh?

2485
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:58,460
Why are you looking away, huh?

2486
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:01,260
You would never call me out, right?

2487
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:03,440
You would never call me out, right?

2488
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:04,700
Okay, don't call me out.

2489
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:21,300
Damn.

2490
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:23,720
Tic-tac-taker!

2491
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:24,640
Welcome to membership.

2492
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:25,640
Thank you!

2493
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:28,520
Really?

2494
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:30,040
It was just one frost?

2495
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:31,100
One queen?

2496
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:34,880
Yeah?

2497
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:35,620
Yeah.

2498
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:37,200
Okay.

2499
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:38,980
Okay.

2500
02:12:38,980 --> 02:12:40,880
Bye-bye.

2501
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:54,730
How did I get away with that?

2502
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:00,790
Cool.

2503
02:13:01,330 --> 02:13:02,490
I'm safe baby.

2504
02:13:05,090 --> 02:13:06,210
I'm safe baby.

2505
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:09,850
Nice.

2506
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:13,530
Oh my god!

2507
02:13:13,530 --> 02:13:14,470
Frost.

2508
02:13:16,150 --> 02:13:17,690
Frost, why did you lie?

2509
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:19,790
Why couldn't you just be a truther?

2510
02:13:21,690 --> 02:13:23,130
Just welcome to membership!

2511
02:13:24,510 --> 02:13:25,190
Don't die.

2512
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:25,770
Okay, good.

2513
02:13:29,190 --> 02:13:31,650
It's not Frost's time yet.

2514
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:32,830
Yet.

2515
02:13:34,570 --> 02:13:37,210
I hope I have... I hope I have a red king!

2516
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:39,430
I hope I have a red king!

2517
02:13:39,430 --> 02:13:40,010
Red king!

2518
02:13:41,830 --> 02:13:42,730
Dang it.

2519
02:13:43,170 --> 02:13:49,830
I wanted it.

2520
02:13:53,690 --> 02:13:55,070
What the hell was that?

2521
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:56,610
Did you just whip your head around me?

2522
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:57,210
Do it again.

2523
02:13:57,310 --> 02:13:57,650
Do it again.

2524
02:14:05,330 --> 02:14:06,710
Is it real?

2525
02:14:06,910 --> 02:14:07,490
Is it real?

2526
02:14:07,830 --> 02:14:08,350
Be honest.

2527
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:09,130
It is real?

2528
02:14:12,030 --> 02:14:12,850
It's real.

2529
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:19,330
I pressed the wrong button!

2530
02:14:19,690 --> 02:14:20,170
Oh wait!

2531
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:21,450
I pressed the right button.

2532
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:22,270
Just kidding.

2533
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:27,970
I meant to press the E.

2534
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:31,150
Stop doing that.

2535
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:32,750
It's creeping me out.

2536
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:41,740
Alright.

2537
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:43,320
Alright.

2538
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:44,240
Ace's table.

2539
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:47,020
I hope I have a red ace!

2540
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:51,180
Ace.

2541
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:56,580
I don't think Curry Ninja will call me out though.

2542
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,670
Is that real?

2543
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:16,000
Curry Ninja, you'll call me out sometimes, right?

2544
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:18,660
You'll call me out sometimes, right?

2545
02:15:18,660 --> 02:15:18,700
Right?

2546
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,660
Floating Soleil!

2547
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:24,160
Thanks for the gift!

2548
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:45,560
Now shoot my little piggies!

2549
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:47,740
Shoot my little piggies!

2550
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:13,470
Oh my god!

2551
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:24,700
I can't believe.

2552
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:26,420
I can't believe!

2553
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:29,440
Really?

2554
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:30,500
One queen?

2555
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:31,560
OK.

2556
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:34,000
What do you think about that Frost?

2557
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:34,840
Oh OK.

2558
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:40,700
I'm a truther!

2559
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:46,960
Real.

2560
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:50,240
Real.

2561
02:16:58,180 --> 02:16:59,300
I'm safe baby.

2562
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:00,760
I'm safe.

2563
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:04,380
He chose wisely.

2564
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:04,840
Absolutely.

2565
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:08,220
Frost, did you lie?

2566
02:17:08,700 --> 02:17:09,300
Frost!

2567
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:11,420
Again?

2568
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:14,100
Frost.

2569
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:21,180
Oh my god!

2570
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:30,440
Guys, I told you the dog is lucky.

2571
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,560
You and me, Domenki.

2572
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,520
You and me, Domenki.

2573
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:42,960
Is that real?

2574
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:46,200
Really?

2575
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:51,520
I'm calling you out!

2576
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,980
Curry Ninja!

2577
02:17:56,360 --> 02:17:57,040
Don't look away.

2578
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:57,700
Don't look away.

2579
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,400
Face your shame.

2580
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:01,440
Face your shame.

2581
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:10,820
OK OK I had a pretty good hand too.

2582
02:18:10,940 --> 02:18:11,320
Dang.

2583
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:16,060
Oh, whoops.

2584
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:16,820
I didn't mean that.

2585
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:19,120
I keep pressing B.

2586
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:20,820
It's a king's table?

2587
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:21,160
OK.

2588
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:25,980
That real?

2589
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:32,790
Yeah, OK.

2590
02:18:41,510 --> 02:18:42,290
Hey, Curry Ninja.

2591
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:43,310
We can talk about this, OK?

2592
02:18:44,150 --> 02:18:45,890
Look, yeah, we can talk about this.

2593
02:18:46,130 --> 02:18:47,690
Look, I'm a truther.

2594
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:50,110
But, today...

2595
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:51,830
Today, it was just my bad day, alright?

2596
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:04,890
Panda, why aren't you on my side?

2597
02:19:06,290 --> 02:19:06,990
King's table.

2598
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:12,290
Actually, I think it's too bold of a move.

2599
02:19:13,630 --> 02:19:14,930
I think it's too bold of a move.

2600
02:19:14,930 --> 02:19:16,050
One king.

2601
02:19:17,630 --> 02:19:18,910
I think it's too bold.

2602
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:21,510
Two kings.

2603
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:22,730
Really?

2604
02:19:23,770 --> 02:19:25,070
OK, then I too.

2605
02:19:26,610 --> 02:19:28,310
Two kings.

2606
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:33,200
One king.

2607
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:38,040
I think I gotta try.

2608
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:41,060
Liar!

2609
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,180
I think I gotta try.

2610
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:45,540
No!

2611
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:46,620
Curry Ninja.

2612
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:47,660
Curry Ninja.

2613
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:49,400
Curry Ninja, I'm gonna die.

2614
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:50,740
Curry Ninja, I'm gonna die.

2615
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:53,540
Nobody wants to eat dog!

2616
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:54,600
Everybody wants to eat pig!

2617
02:19:54,780 --> 02:19:55,000
Please!

2618
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:55,880
Oh, nevermind, nevermind.

2619
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:59,500
How many do I have left?

2620
02:20:07,630 --> 02:20:09,410
Oh, I have four left.

2621
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:10,370
Good.

2622
02:20:10,970 --> 02:20:11,230
Maybe.

2623
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:12,150
Oh, wait.

2624
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,250
Ace's table.

2625
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:15,990
You know what?

2626
02:20:16,050 --> 02:20:16,450
Screw it.

2627
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:21,090
You're pushing your luck.

2628
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:23,550
Screw it.

2629
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,220
Streamer luck real.

2630
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,340
One ace.

2631
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:41,080
Is that real?

2632
02:20:45,370 --> 02:20:47,010
Don't look so... OK.

2633
02:20:47,270 --> 02:20:47,710
Really?

2634
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:48,790
Come on.

2635
02:20:49,130 --> 02:20:49,730
Was it real?

2636
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:56,250
One ace.

2637
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:05,270
Come on, Curry Ninja.

2638
02:21:06,330 --> 02:21:06,810
No!

2639
02:21:06,990 --> 02:21:08,210
Why do you hate me?

2640
02:21:08,730 --> 02:21:10,090
Why do you hate me?

2641
02:21:12,150 --> 02:21:13,930
Was the last one actually real though?

2642
02:21:14,190 --> 02:21:15,110
Was it actually real?

2643
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:15,570
Tell me.

2644
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:17,410
Was it real?

2645
02:21:18,650 --> 02:21:19,030
Yeah?

2646
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:32,370
Oh my gosh!

2647
02:21:32,430 --> 02:21:32,910
Oh my gosh!

2648
02:21:32,990 --> 02:21:33,970
Oh my gosh!

2649
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:35,010
Oh my gosh!

2650
02:21:35,210 --> 02:21:36,270
One ace.

2651
02:21:36,770 --> 02:21:38,010
Let's play it safe guys.

2652
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:38,970
Let's play it safe.

2653
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:40,070
What does that mean?

2654
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:47,210
I think I should call him out.

2655
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:57,760
Little lion.

2656
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,080
Little white lies here and there, you know.

2657
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:01,800
We call them Disney lies.

2658
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:02,960
Curry Ninja they pile...

2659
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,480
Well played Minto.

2660
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:29,310
I think we will do one last game.

2661
02:22:31,090 --> 02:22:33,270
This will be the last one you guys.

2662
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:34,190
Thanks Mint.

2663
02:22:34,290 --> 02:22:34,790
Thank you!

2664
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:37,470
Thank you, thank you.

2665
02:22:38,290 --> 02:22:38,690
Alright.

2666
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:45,320
That's the dog.

2667
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:46,980
He's a lucky dog.

2668
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:49,940
He's a lucky dog.

2669
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:51,320
Alright.

2670
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:54,060
Alright, alright.

2671
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:56,760
Diamond dogs.

2672
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,440
Diamond dogs!

2673
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,200
So true!

2674
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:04,840
Okay.

2675
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:06,960
Alright guys, let's go.

2676
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:10,020
Ready up, dogs.

2677
02:23:11,020 --> 02:23:13,080
Alright, let's go baby.

2678
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:19,300
Oh my gosh, that was the fastest loading we probably had so far.

2679
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,480
That was so fast.

2680
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:25,080
That was so fast.

2681
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:26,140
That was such a fast loading.

2682
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:29,280
Oh my gosh, this is my first time seeing the fox.

2683
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:30,960
Oh the ears wiggle so cute.

2684
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,000
Lucky dog.

2685
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:36,220
Welcome, welcome.

2686
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:37,420
Welcome, welcome.

2687
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:40,780
Okay.

2688
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,480
Great game.

2689
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:44,840
Thanks Frost.

2690
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:47,380
Queen's table.

2691
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:50,820
Is that real?

2692
02:23:54,210 --> 02:23:55,360
Is it real?

2693
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:55,680
Yeah?

2694
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:56,320
It's real?

2695
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:57,240
Really real?

2696
02:23:58,060 --> 02:23:58,840
Really, really real.

2697
02:24:00,020 --> 02:24:00,320
Yeah?

2698
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:00,620
Okay.

2699
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:02,580
Alright, I'm trusting you this time.

2700
02:24:03,700 --> 02:24:04,900
One queen.

2701
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:07,420
One queen.

2702
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:10,880
Canonically, the fox is in love with the dog.

2703
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:11,160
What?

2704
02:24:12,340 --> 02:24:14,580
Is that why she's staring at me like that?

2705
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:18,620
Is the fox in love with the dog?

2706
02:24:19,180 --> 02:24:20,400
One queen.

2707
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:21,300
Canonically?

2708
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:22,100
Yes?

2709
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:25,460
Oh my god.

2710
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:27,460
Moonbies.

2711
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:28,840
Really?

2712
02:24:29,420 --> 02:24:31,320
Is it moonbees or moonbies?

2713
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:34,020
Moonbies.

2714
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:34,600
Yeah?

2715
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:35,080
Okay.

2716
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:37,740
The game has lore?

2717
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:44,560
Two queens.

2718
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:52,600
One queen.

2719
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,320
Okay, okay, okay.

2720
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:56,300
It's on the main menu.

2721
02:24:56,580 --> 02:24:59,760
Okay, I'll check it out after this.

2722
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:02,340
Very short comic strips on the main menu.

2723
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:05,740
That's fun.

2724
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:08,840
Is that real?

2725
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:13,160
Are you sure it's real?

2726
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:14,780
I don't know platypus.

2727
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:16,300
I'm kind of agreeing with you.

2728
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:18,640
Is it really real?

2729
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:20,680
No?

2730
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:21,080
Okay.

2731
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:27,240
I trusted you!

2732
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:29,020
I trusted you!

2733
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:30,780
Why would you do this to me?

2734
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:53,590
It's LG and I die first round.

2735
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:01,470
So guys, this is awkward.

2736
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:03,770
Mortis.

2737
02:26:04,830 --> 02:26:06,290
Sorry Minto.

2738
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:09,230
I would have died first anyway.

2739
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:12,010
I didn't get into the game today, but I've enjoyed the stream today.

2740
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:12,890
Hopefully I'll get in next time.

2741
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,510
Yeah!

2742
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:14,330
Hopefully!

2743
02:26:17,090 --> 02:26:20,790
I always wish with these types of things that I could let everybody in.

2744
02:26:23,210 --> 02:26:28,010
Oh my god, imagine if it was like this game, but with a hundred people.

2745
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:30,470
Would take like a year.

2746
02:26:33,150 --> 02:26:33,550
Liar!

2747
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:38,010
Join me.

2748
02:26:38,070 --> 02:26:39,430
Oh my god, my mouth is moving.

2749
02:26:45,090 --> 02:26:45,790
You're fine.

2750
02:26:47,610 --> 02:26:47,970
See?

2751
02:26:48,130 --> 02:26:48,590
I told you.

2752
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:53,950
Is it weird that I'm like barking?

2753
02:26:54,330 --> 02:26:55,950
Or like... Should I... No?

2754
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:56,270
Okay.

2755
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:15,640
Two kings.

2756
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:18,860
It's kind of expected.

2757
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:19,700
How?

2758
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:21,060
Where?

2759
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:21,500
Who?

2760
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:24,380
Why would you... Why would you expect that?

2761
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:26,420
Minto, you're always weird.

2762
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:29,280
Oh my gosh.

2763
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:30,740
Oh no.

2764
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:32,700
Eat it piggy.

2765
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:36,140
Bring it on baby.

2766
02:27:39,620 --> 02:27:41,300
Oh my god!

2767
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:44,460
Every time I have the death howl, you guys.

2768
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:45,780
Every time I howl.

2769
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:46,400
Weird?

2770
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:46,820
Yes.

2771
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:47,340
Out of character?

2772
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:47,740
No.

2773
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:52,840
Minto, have you ever not been weird?

2774
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:55,340
I don't know.

2775
02:27:57,140 --> 02:27:58,640
You guys, you have to live.

2776
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:00,080
Oh my god!

2777
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:01,820
Nevermind!

2778
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:02,900
Oh my god!

2779
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:06,360
Moonbyes, you're about to say bye-byes.

2780
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:13,480
Howl at the moon!

2781
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:15,060
There we go.

2782
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:15,300
See?

2783
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:16,300
Okay.

2784
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:22,600
You got the power of the moon on your side and I'm the dog and I go...

2785
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:23,600
Howl at the moon!

2786
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:25,060
I used to do that with my grandma.

2787
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:28,700
My grandma wouldn't want to go outside and she would want to howl at the moon.

2788
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:31,760
She would take me to the grocery store and say let's howl at the moon together.

2789
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:32,840
And say okay grandma.

2790
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:42,600
Your freaky grandma?

2791
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:43,380
Who else?

2792
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:45,960
Who else would it be?

2793
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:49,280
Oh my gosh, Pitara gets to meet my grandma next week.

2794
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:54,480
Moonbyes.

2795
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:56,640
Moonbyes, you can't say bye-byes right now.

2796
02:28:57,100 --> 02:28:57,760
Oh my god, no.

2797
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:00,500
Oh my god.

2798
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:03,240
Don't fail me now.

2799
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:16,540
Your grandma is finally meeting someone older than her.

2800
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:24,700
Yo, that's so...

2801
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:26,080
Liar!

2802
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:26,560
Oh my god.

2803
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:27,800
Oh my god, AK!

2804
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:28,380
AK!

2805
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:30,240
That was a real AK move.

2806
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:30,960
AK!

2807
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:31,800
Oh my god.

2808
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:32,640
Yeah, it was.

2809
02:29:32,740 --> 02:29:33,300
Yeah, I know.

2810
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:33,840
That's okay.

2811
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:34,580
It'll be fine.

2812
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:36,040
Woo!

2813
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,360
Minto inherited the freak.

2814
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:45,100
No.

2815
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:47,540
No.

2816
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:53,480
This is intense.

2817
02:29:53,620 --> 02:29:54,580
It's just the two of them.

2818
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:56,020
So it's like anyone's game.

2819
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:57,260
And they're both 2-2.

2820
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:04,600
I want a mint puppy.

2821
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:10,360
If you get one of those robot dogs, you could...

2822
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:14,980
If you get one of those robot dogs, you could like program my bark in it, you know?

2823
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:17,620
Oh my god.

2824
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:18,380
Oh my god!

2825
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:21,340
Moonbyes.

2826
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:25,700
You got this.

2827
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:28,300
You got this.

2828
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,300
Oh no!

2829
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:30,700
She doesn't got this!

2830
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:33,180
Moonbyes for real!

2831
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:38,480
Why did he say that?

2832
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:39,780
Why did he say two queens?

2833
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:46,020
I guess you could say AKjammer just called a bowl.

2834
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:48,960
Yay!

2835
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:51,400
Thank you!

2836
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:59,280
Viewers in the chat are discussing a story about the streamer's grandmother who was reportedly a werewolf.

2837
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:01,920
No!

2838
02:31:13,750 --> 02:31:16,570
I don't think it's fair because I feel like people...

2839
02:31:17,410 --> 02:31:21,510
I feel like people stopped trying because I said it was last game, you know?

2840
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:28,230
There's probably people who are just like, no I didn't try again because I...

2841
02:31:31,690 --> 02:31:32,650
Because I...

2842
02:31:32,650 --> 02:31:34,990
Kevin, also biggest mid fan.

2843
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:40,630
If you guys can keep coming in, leaving and coming in...

2844
02:31:42,850 --> 02:31:44,630
You guys can come say hi.

2845
02:31:45,170 --> 02:31:45,610
Hi!

2846
02:31:46,430 --> 02:31:49,290
You guys can come in, say hi and leave.

2847
02:31:49,610 --> 02:31:50,990
And then lots of people can come in.

2848
02:31:52,750 --> 02:31:53,950
No, I didn't try again.

2849
02:31:54,030 --> 02:31:54,210
See?

2850
02:31:54,310 --> 02:31:55,270
That's what I'm saying.

2851
02:31:55,590 --> 02:31:56,470
That's what I was just like.

2852
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:58,770
I don't think it would be right for me to do another game.

2853
02:31:58,770 --> 02:32:02,250
I'm sorry as much as I'm so happy that you guys got in.

2854
02:32:02,350 --> 02:32:04,150
I'm so sorry I did say it was last game.

2855
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:08,290
There's probably people that stopped trying to get in.

2856
02:32:09,310 --> 02:32:10,190
Also, hi Kay!

2857
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:18,440
That's the second time in a week Mike Tyson got destroyed.

2858
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:22,420
Doom the fireman.

2859
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,000
Bye Minto.

2860
02:32:23,220 --> 02:32:23,580
Bye!

2861
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:28,380
Let Mike Tyson play!

2862
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:35,980
But then it's not fair to the people that have been coming in and leaving.

2863
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:44,840
Let him.

2864
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:46,860
Last one for the legend.

2865
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:49,140
Are you guys OK with that?

2866
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:52,260
It's OK, I left.

2867
02:32:56,780 --> 02:32:57,740
1v1 Mike Tyson?

2868
02:32:57,880 --> 02:32:58,520
Can I do that?

2869
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:01,740
Why is the music so epic?

2870
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:04,460
I like how Kevin just keeps coming and leaving and coming.

2871
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:05,080
Yes?

2872
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:07,640
Alright, ready up boys.

2873
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:09,780
Ready up.

2874
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:12,760
The music is for him.

2875
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:16,200
Can we 1v1?

2876
02:33:19,790 --> 02:33:20,830
Is it possible?

2877
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:29,300
I don't want anyone to feel like they're getting screwed over, you know?

2878
02:33:30,580 --> 02:33:31,480
Guys, Minto hates us.

2879
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,700
There's a Metal Gear Solid Snake password.

2880
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:35,000
What are you talking about?

2881
02:33:43,140 --> 02:33:44,400
Alright, here we go.

2882
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:52,280
Alright.

2883
02:33:54,020 --> 02:33:55,160
I can hear myself!

2884
02:33:55,300 --> 02:33:55,980
I can hear myself!

2885
02:33:58,620 --> 02:33:59,620
I hear me.

2886
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:00,200
Hello?

2887
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:02,580
Who am I hearing?

2888
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:13,180
Oh my God, there we go.

2889
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:13,640
Alright.

2890
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:16,800
Real LG everybody.

2891
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:22,100
Realist LG.

2892
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:23,540
Realist LG.

2893
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:25,680
Realist LG everybody.

2894
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:29,860
Mike Tyson, you OK?

2895
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:31,520
Eating Mike Tyson's ass?

2896
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:32,920
Are you alive?

2897
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:35,500
OK.

2898
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:40,560
Ace's table?

2899
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:45,180
I don't know.

2900
02:34:45,380 --> 02:34:45,940
I don't know.

2901
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:47,240
I don't know.

2902
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:48,080
You know what?

2903
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:49,220
Liar.

2904
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:52,060
I'm calling liar.

2905
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:54,520
Biggest Mint fan.

2906
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:58,460
Why would you lie about that to me?

2907
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:02,920
Bring it on.

2908
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:09,020
I big brained that you guys.

2909
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:09,580
Hmm.

2910
02:35:15,240 --> 02:35:17,860
Don't ever lie to Minto.

2911
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:21,200
Never lie to Minto.

2912
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:23,140
What is it?

2913
02:35:23,180 --> 02:35:23,760
King's table?

2914
02:35:24,820 --> 02:35:25,140
OK.

2915
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:29,180
Alright.

2916
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:32,560
Your move, Kevin.

2917
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:33,780
Oh, just kidding.

2918
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:34,500
Biggest Mint fan.

2919
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,600
I saw your move.

2920
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:39,860
Oh...

2921
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:45,480
Two Kings.

2922
02:35:52,980 --> 02:35:54,200
One King.

2923
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:55,920
I got away with that.

2924
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,020
One King.

2925
02:35:58,560 --> 02:35:59,460
One King.

2926
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:00,680
What are you going to do?

2927
02:36:01,100 --> 02:36:01,740
No!

2928
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:04,240
I wanted to do my turn!

2929
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:06,940
Hmm.

2930
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:08,500
Oof.

2931
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:11,640
You shouldn't have called him out, man.

2932
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:16,580
I was stuck in text chat.

2933
02:36:20,660 --> 02:36:21,200
Alright.

2934
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:23,860
Queen's table, eh?

2935
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:25,200
This game is so fun.

2936
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:29,180
I used to play a lot of cheat on Neopets when I was a kid.

2937
02:36:29,180 --> 02:36:33,420
Oh my god, who said yippee over there?

2938
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:35,120
Yippee!

2939
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:37,760
Queen's table.

2940
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:39,020
Two Queens.

2941
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:40,920
I can't believe I'm in a game with my Yoshi.

2942
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:43,020
Believe it.

2943
02:36:43,380 --> 02:36:43,860
Datebayo.

2944
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:47,260
Yeah, did you guys ever play cheat?

2945
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:49,220
You cheated in Neopets?

2946
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:50,520
No, I played cheat.

2947
02:36:50,620 --> 02:36:51,380
It was a game.

2948
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:53,820
Is that real?

2949
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:57,680
Maybe he is playing it safe.

2950
02:37:00,300 --> 02:37:01,120
Liar!

2951
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:07,180
You said no!

2952
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:13,360
I swear to god, I won't die.

2953
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:15,580
I will never actually die.

2954
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,480
Don't die, Minto.

2955
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:25,000
I never actually die.

2956
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:27,020
I always come back.

2957
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:29,040
King's table, eh?

2958
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,880
Two Kings.

2959
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:37,540
Date Minto.

2960
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:40,600
Datebayo.

2961
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:46,460
Someone's got a death wish.

2962
02:37:48,700 --> 02:37:49,500
Is that real?

2963
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:50,100
Is that real?

2964
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:53,420
Is it really real?

2965
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:53,860
Yeah?

2966
02:37:54,220 --> 02:37:54,560
No?

2967
02:37:54,820 --> 02:37:55,720
I knew it.

2968
02:37:57,560 --> 02:37:58,840
One King.

2969
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:05,700
I will also join you in cheating.

2970
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:06,840
I mean...

2971
02:38:07,580 --> 02:38:08,720
Three Kings.

2972
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:11,720
Two Kings.

2973
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:13,880
He just let me get away with it.

2974
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:18,080
Down to you guys.

2975
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:22,780
One King.

2976
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:27,220
What if everybody puts down their cards with no one...

2977
02:38:27,220 --> 02:38:28,300
One King.

2978
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:30,500
Someone's got to call someone out.

2979
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:32,900
Will it be like the...

2980
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:33,580
One King.

2981
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:36,080
Someone...the last person who goes...

2982
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:37,000
One King.

2983
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:38,620
Says...is the liar or whatever.

2984
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:39,880
It auto calls liar.

2985
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:43,420
Oh my god, Kevin.

2986
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:44,340
Kevin!

2987
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:52,040
This one's for you, darling.

2988
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:52,800
Bacon, bacon!

2989
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:54,180
For dinner!

2990
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:55,440
Close one.

2991
02:38:58,160 --> 02:38:59,860
Breakfast for dinner, baby.

2992
02:39:01,020 --> 02:39:02,660
Forget to call people out.

2993
02:39:04,780 --> 02:39:07,300
I like how it just says biggest mint.

2994
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:11,020
Doesn't even say the rest.

2995
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:11,940
Just biggest mint.

2996
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:13,560
Ace's table.

2997
02:39:21,350 --> 02:39:22,550
Three Aces.

2998
02:39:28,810 --> 02:39:29,370
What?

2999
02:39:29,690 --> 02:39:30,130
What?

3000
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:31,270
You call me out now?

3001
02:39:32,650 --> 02:39:34,010
Why would you do that?

3002
02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:35,150
Why?

3003
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:37,150
Why?

3004
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:40,870
I always come back.

3005
02:39:40,910 --> 02:39:41,850
I always come back!

3006
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Mike Tyson's ass you have to win.

3007
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:04,400
You have to eat it.

3008
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:05,360
Eat it!

3009
02:40:09,340 --> 02:40:11,520
I need another eye patch now.

3010
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,240
I'm not so sure you are good at this game.

3011
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:16,680
What are you talking about?

3012
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:22,520
It's partial luck, isn't it?

3013
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:24,280
Partial luck.

3014
02:40:36,790 --> 02:40:39,310
Since Minto died, going to take a photo with her.

3015
02:40:39,370 --> 02:40:40,390
What are you talking about?

3016
02:40:41,230 --> 02:40:42,870
Don't take a photo of my corpse.

3017
02:40:42,870 --> 02:40:43,730
What?

3018
02:40:43,970 --> 02:40:44,150
What?

3019
02:40:44,470 --> 02:40:44,790
What?

3020
02:40:46,830 --> 02:40:48,490
It's so mint over.

3021
02:40:50,110 --> 02:40:52,910
Why the one time you have to call me out?

3022
02:40:53,870 --> 02:40:55,530
Oh my god.

3023
02:40:56,770 --> 02:40:57,330
Kevin!

3024
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:00,870
Join me Kevin!

3025
02:41:01,250 --> 02:41:01,750
Look at me.

3026
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:03,610
Don't I look so relaxed now that I'm dead?

3027
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:05,910
Yeah, I know.

3028
02:41:06,010 --> 02:41:06,950
Taking a good old nap.

3029
02:41:07,410 --> 02:41:08,770
Too bad for you buddy.

3030
02:41:15,250 --> 02:41:17,770
I always die!

3031
02:41:24,570 --> 02:41:27,630
Doesn't anybody care that I'm lying here?

3032
02:41:28,470 --> 02:41:33,810
Will someone put out my cigar?

3033
02:41:36,090 --> 02:41:37,770
Three kings!

3034
02:41:37,930 --> 02:41:38,710
Oh my god, liar!

3035
02:41:39,310 --> 02:41:40,730
Someone's got a death wish.

3036
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:42,290
Thank you for the game, Minto.

3037
02:41:42,770 --> 02:41:44,230
Glad to have played with my Kamiyoshi.

3038
02:41:44,330 --> 02:41:45,350
Thanks, Splatterplace!

3039
02:41:45,690 --> 02:41:46,470
It was so fun.

3040
02:41:48,310 --> 02:41:49,070
Oh my god.

3041
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:50,090
Kevin?

3042
02:41:51,390 --> 02:41:51,790
Kevin.

3043
02:41:52,690 --> 02:41:53,090
Kevin.

3044
02:41:55,230 --> 02:41:55,630
Kevin.

3045
02:41:57,430 --> 02:41:59,830
Actually, mine was a blank.

3046
02:42:00,130 --> 02:42:01,290
So I'm actually still alive.

3047
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:02,450
Can you guys give me some cards?

3048
02:42:04,410 --> 02:42:04,810
No?

3049
02:42:04,930 --> 02:42:05,370
Yeah, yeah.

3050
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:07,090
Yeah, give me some cards.

3051
02:42:07,210 --> 02:42:08,050
I want to play the game.

3052
02:42:12,680 --> 02:42:14,960
The mouth moving is freaking me out.

3053
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:15,820
It's so funny.

3054
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:18,820
Let's see from another angle.

3055
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:21,780
Let's see from the bear angle maybe.

3056
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:23,520
Oh, you can't see me.

3057
02:42:23,560 --> 02:42:23,960
Just kidding.

3058
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:27,080
Two aces!

3059
02:42:27,580 --> 02:42:28,520
Oh come on.

3060
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:30,100
Come on.

3061
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:32,680
You are a liar to surpass the liar.

3062
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:34,840
I name you Big Liar!

3063
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:36,680
Liar, liar.

3064
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:37,980
Liar, liar.

3065
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:38,820
Pants on fire.

3066
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:42,140
Oops.

3067
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:48,240
Oh my god, Kevin.

3068
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:48,780
Kevin!

3069
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:53,880
Wow.

3070
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:55,660
I wish that were my gun.

3071
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:56,700
You should have switched with me.

3072
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:57,960
What the hell?

3073
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:00,360
Don't laugh!

3074
02:43:00,620 --> 02:43:01,680
Don't laugh at that!

3075
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:05,040
This is messed up.

3076
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:06,480
Hackjammer.

3077
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:09,240
Look at the bamboo ship!

3078
02:43:09,320 --> 02:43:10,600
Thanks for playing with me.

3079
02:43:14,360 --> 02:43:15,920
Kevin stole the streamer luck.

3080
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:17,900
Kevin stole the precious thing.

3081
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:19,620
Use your revival pill.

3082
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:23,900
My river.

3083
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,260
Oh my god.

3084
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:29,360
Who would have thunk?

3085
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:31,060
All three cards.

3086
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:32,500
Take it.

3087
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:33,100
Eat it.

3088
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:33,680
Pork!

3089
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:34,320
Pork!

3090
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:34,960
Pork!

3091
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:36,340
Get porked!

3092
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:37,180
Get porked!

3093
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:38,240
Get porked!

3094
02:43:39,780 --> 02:43:40,680
Liar, liar.

3095
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:41,880
Minko on fire.

3096
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:43,180
What's the name of the name?

3097
02:43:43,300 --> 02:43:46,640
Wait, that's the rest of the name we can't see.

3098
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:47,980
Biggest Mint Liar.

3099
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:55,500
They call me John Pork for a reason.

3100
02:43:56,340 --> 02:44:00,240
No, they call you...they call you eating Mike Tyson's ass.

3101
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:03,660
You can never change your name.

3102
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:11,260
Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

3103
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:12,860
Alright.

3104
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:13,620
Liar.

3105
02:44:15,140 --> 02:44:15,660
I think.

3106
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:19,660
If you are a big fan, if you are my biggest fan, you call him out.

3107
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:21,120
Yeah.

3108
02:44:21,860 --> 02:44:24,740
I'm summoning...I'm telling you from beyond the grave.

3109
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:27,340
He's a liar and a cheat.

3110
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:29,680
Don't just stare at my dead body.

3111
02:44:29,740 --> 02:44:30,100
Do something!

3112
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:31,480
Do something!

3113
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:32,800
Call him out!

3114
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:34,320
What?

3115
02:44:40,180 --> 02:44:41,240
Senpai, no!

3116
02:44:47,140 --> 02:44:49,640
Why didn't you listen to me?

3117
02:44:51,860 --> 02:44:52,820
Oh my god!

3118
02:44:52,940 --> 02:44:53,480
Oh my god!

3119
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:54,140
Oh my god!

3120
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:54,780
Oh my god!

3121
02:44:57,120 --> 02:44:58,880
How many does he have, Mike Tyson?

3122
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:01,300
Oh, this is Mike Tyson's first.

3123
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:02,460
You'll be fine.

3124
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:03,460
It's your first one.

3125
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:06,320
Hey, don't get too relaxed, OK?

3126
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:15,120
E-M-T-A.

3127
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:16,420
Is that what you guys call him?

3128
02:45:16,460 --> 02:45:17,040
It's so funny.

3129
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:19,920
Two kings.

3130
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:21,540
Liar.

3131
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:26,800
Oh my god!

3132
02:45:28,220 --> 02:45:28,900
I called.

3133
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:29,400
I told you.

3134
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:30,000
See?

3135
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:31,280
This is why you always listen to Minto.

3136
02:45:31,660 --> 02:45:33,100
This is why you listen to Minto, everybody.

3137
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:37,360
Sayonara!

3138
02:45:39,460 --> 02:45:40,140
Just kidding.

3139
02:45:40,660 --> 02:45:42,060
I psyched you up there, didn't I?

3140
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:43,940
You were really scared, weren't you?

3141
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:46,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3142
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:46,740
Don't worry.

3143
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:47,300
I got you, buddy.

3144
02:45:52,450 --> 02:45:54,230
You got me there, didn't I?

3145
02:45:55,430 --> 02:45:57,170
Say psych right now.

3146
02:45:57,910 --> 02:45:58,210
Psych!

3147
02:46:08,890 --> 02:46:11,570
This kicks me out because this is a pig's table.

3148
02:46:12,790 --> 02:46:14,930
They are just like, no dogs allowed.

3149
02:46:14,930 --> 02:46:16,830
Only pigs here.

3150
02:46:17,530 --> 02:46:19,510
Would you guys rather be a dog or a pig?

3151
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:22,770
Oh my god!

3152
02:46:22,970 --> 02:46:24,390
Oh my god!

3153
02:46:25,170 --> 02:46:25,490
Uh-oh.

3154
02:46:25,990 --> 02:46:26,850
This might be it for you.

3155
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:30,370
Biggest mint.

3156
02:46:31,990 --> 02:46:33,250
What the hell are you doing to that gun?

3157
02:46:41,370 --> 02:46:42,090
No pork.

3158
02:46:42,190 --> 02:46:42,710
Only pork.

3159
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:47,070
A pig because they live best in animal farm.

3160
02:46:47,630 --> 02:46:48,790
Like the book?

3161
02:46:51,090 --> 02:46:51,690
Dog.

3162
02:46:55,070 --> 02:46:58,490
Someone on my table says, Minto, turn on my liar inhibitor.

3163
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:03,150
Freak you with the gun.

3164
02:47:03,910 --> 02:47:04,830
That's my freak.

3165
02:47:13,110 --> 02:47:14,890
You can be a pet as a dog.

3166
02:47:15,010 --> 02:47:16,550
You can be a pet as a pig too.

3167
02:47:17,290 --> 02:47:19,250
I've seen people walk their pet pigs before.

3168
02:47:21,410 --> 02:47:22,510
I don't know.

3169
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:24,910
I don't know.

3170
02:47:25,690 --> 02:47:26,530
Kevin, what do you think?

3171
02:47:27,530 --> 02:47:27,870
No?

3172
02:47:29,410 --> 02:47:29,910
No?

3173
02:47:32,290 --> 02:47:33,470
Call it out.

3174
02:47:34,990 --> 02:47:35,510
What?

3175
02:47:35,730 --> 02:47:37,490
What happened to calling it out?

3176
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:41,090
This is messed up.

3177
02:47:41,210 --> 02:47:44,490
I love when dogs are really weird about like...

3178
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:50,510
Ripperoni.

3179
02:47:54,410 --> 02:47:54,850
Kevin!

3180
02:47:57,170 --> 02:47:57,890
Kevin!

3181
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:02,300
Kevin, why didn't you give me your gun?

3182
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:02,360
Kevin!

3183
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:28,540
Plot twist.

3184
02:48:28,700 --> 02:48:29,660
Mint's gun was loaded.

3185
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:34,020
But yeah, I love when dogs are really stupid when like...

3186
02:48:34,020 --> 02:48:37,440
You know, they're like... Okay, so I went... I took a walk today.

3187
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:40,180
And there was someone walking their dog.

3188
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:42,040
And the dog just kind of was like stopped.

3189
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:43,940
And stared at me like...

3190
02:48:45,420 --> 02:48:48,540
And then they like stare for a second and then they just like take off.

3191
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:49,380
For no reason.

3192
02:48:49,480 --> 02:48:50,600
They're just like...

3193
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:51,920
And like run away.

3194
02:48:52,220 --> 02:48:52,900
They're so funny.

3195
02:48:57,380 --> 02:48:58,440
Dogs can see ghosts.

3196
02:48:58,440 --> 02:49:00,860
That was probably why he was so shocked.

3197
02:49:01,580 --> 02:49:03,460
I didn't think about that.

3198
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:05,680
He saw a ghost.

3199
02:49:07,420 --> 02:49:09,460
But he wouldn't know I'm a ghost.

3200
02:49:10,060 --> 02:49:10,620
Probably.

3201
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:11,860
Right?

3202
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:13,300
What are you guys doing?

3203
02:49:13,620 --> 02:49:14,060
Come on.

3204
02:49:16,510 --> 02:49:16,970
Oh my god!

3205
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:17,670
Kevin.

3206
02:49:19,230 --> 02:49:19,790
Kevin.

3207
02:49:20,490 --> 02:49:21,010
Kevin!

3208
02:49:21,590 --> 02:49:22,490
Sayonara, Kevin!

3209
02:49:22,630 --> 02:49:25,630
Wait, what if... It could be a double blow.

3210
02:49:25,910 --> 02:49:26,370
Oh my god!

3211
02:49:26,410 --> 02:49:26,850
It could be...

3212
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:27,150
No!

3213
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:38,850
GG's everybody.

3214
02:49:48,270 --> 02:49:49,130
Wait, how do I leave?

3215
02:49:49,190 --> 02:49:49,590
Oh, there we go.

3216
02:49:52,210 --> 02:49:54,710
That was crazy!

3217
02:49:57,390 --> 02:49:59,090
He's the main character.

3218
02:49:59,770 --> 02:50:02,790
To take out two in one shot!

3219
02:50:03,770 --> 02:50:05,930
Literally two birds with one stone.

3220
02:50:06,670 --> 02:50:10,490
Mike Tyson gets his revenge!

3221
02:50:11,290 --> 02:50:12,430
Well, you're not Mike Tyson.

3222
02:50:13,050 --> 02:50:14,510
You're eating his ass.

3223
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:18,930
What a peach indeed.

3224
02:50:20,030 --> 02:50:21,970
Hold on, I want to see the table stories.

3225
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:22,790
Oh look!

3226
02:50:23,370 --> 02:50:25,650
People say it was an accident.

3227
02:50:26,090 --> 02:50:27,870
But I've never heard him talk about it.

3228
02:50:30,010 --> 02:50:33,390
Since then, there's been no room for anyone else in his life.

3229
02:50:33,490 --> 02:50:34,770
Not even himself.

3230
02:50:36,630 --> 02:50:38,350
She looks sad all the time.

3231
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:40,070
She grew up without anyone.

3232
02:50:40,510 --> 02:50:42,910
She fell deeply in love, but she has no luck.

3233
02:50:43,730 --> 02:50:45,870
All the things that we do for love.

3234
02:50:48,110 --> 02:50:50,650
Had to let Mike win after what happened with Jake.

3235
02:50:52,930 --> 02:50:55,070
Kevin, was that you playing with us?

3236
02:50:55,090 --> 02:50:55,750
Thank you!

3237
02:50:57,190 --> 02:50:58,030
What about him?

3238
02:50:59,050 --> 02:51:00,470
You don't want to know.

3239
02:51:02,130 --> 02:51:02,990
He's just dumb?

3240
02:51:05,790 --> 02:51:06,950
It's such a shame.

3241
02:51:07,050 --> 02:51:09,010
There's nothing harder than living with guilt.

3242
02:51:09,610 --> 02:51:10,430
Well, what can you do?

3243
02:51:11,090 --> 02:51:13,270
When he needs to man up, he didn't.

3244
02:51:13,610 --> 02:51:15,270
Now he has to live with that.

3245
02:51:16,530 --> 02:51:18,310
Oh my god, he already drank the poison.

3246
02:51:20,410 --> 02:51:21,830
What about the money?

3247
02:51:22,510 --> 02:51:23,550
He didn't leave anything.

3248
02:51:24,490 --> 02:51:26,170
Not a house, not a single penny.

3249
02:51:26,650 --> 02:51:27,610
Interesting, isn't it?

3250
02:51:27,890 --> 02:51:29,550
Now she gambles every night.

3251
02:51:33,710 --> 02:51:34,870
He's not like the others.

3252
02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:36,110
He loves the life.

3253
02:51:36,590 --> 02:51:38,090
Maybe a little too much.

3254
02:51:43,210 --> 02:51:45,450
I'm going to enter just so we don't have to listen to those...

3255
02:51:49,610 --> 02:51:51,490
Thanks for doing one more game, Minky.

3256
02:51:54,250 --> 02:51:55,530
Thanks for joining everybody.

3257
02:51:55,670 --> 02:51:56,790
This was a lot of fun!

3258
02:51:58,010 --> 02:52:00,950
I want to play more games together, so...

3259
02:52:01,550 --> 02:52:05,250
If you didn't get into this one, we'll do some more in the future.

3260
02:52:07,490 --> 02:52:10,170
Sorry for those who died first round.

3261
02:52:10,430 --> 02:52:12,370
I also died first round sometimes.

3262
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:15,130
I trusted you, Kevin!

3263
02:52:15,390 --> 02:52:16,270
Also GG's.

3264
02:52:16,370 --> 02:52:16,650
GG!

3265
02:52:18,630 --> 02:52:20,930
I don't know if he answered this question before.

3266
02:52:21,030 --> 02:52:22,950
Have you seen Planes, Trains and Automobiles?

3267
02:52:23,010 --> 02:52:24,170
It's a Thanksgiving movie.

3268
02:52:25,570 --> 02:52:27,710
I don't think I have.

3269
02:52:28,990 --> 02:52:30,230
I don't think I have.

3270
02:52:30,230 --> 02:52:31,550
Metal Gear Online next.

3271
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:32,670
We gotta make a server!

3272
02:52:33,250 --> 02:52:34,430
We gotta make a server.

3273
02:52:35,730 --> 02:52:37,170
I love watching Liar's Bar.

3274
02:52:37,270 --> 02:52:37,830
It's so fun to watch.

3275
02:52:37,850 --> 02:52:39,670
It is really fun to watch, isn't it?

3276
02:52:41,690 --> 02:52:46,170
I didn't watch it, but even watching you guys play when I was dead was so fun.

3277
02:52:46,430 --> 02:52:47,750
Alexander, thanks for the ping!

3278
02:52:48,330 --> 02:52:49,070
Thank you.

3279
02:52:49,950 --> 02:52:51,170
That's John Candy.

3280
02:52:51,810 --> 02:52:53,330
Who the heck is John Candy?

3281
02:52:53,690 --> 02:52:57,670
That is the most staged name I've ever heard in my life.

3282
02:53:02,670 --> 02:53:04,010
MGO doesn't need a server.

3283
02:53:04,190 --> 02:53:08,410
Oh, we're talking about... Sorry, I was thinking of 3.

3284
02:53:10,710 --> 02:53:13,090
I wasn't feeling the greatest today, but this stream cheered me up.

3285
02:53:13,390 --> 02:53:15,930
I hope you feel better.

3286
02:53:18,130 --> 02:53:23,630
And also, to everybody who joined and left at that last round...

3287
02:53:23,630 --> 02:53:25,070
Like Tilda, I remember you.

3288
02:53:25,890 --> 02:53:27,310
There was someone else.

3289
02:53:27,970 --> 02:53:29,090
There was one other person.

3290
02:53:32,150 --> 02:53:32,710
But...

3291
02:53:34,910 --> 02:53:37,370
I hope... I really hope you can get in.

3292
02:53:37,650 --> 02:53:38,590
I feel so bad.

3293
02:53:38,710 --> 02:53:42,010
I feel honestly so bad for the people that joined and left.

3294
02:53:42,070 --> 02:53:42,850
I'm so sorry.

3295
02:53:45,490 --> 02:53:46,530
But thank you.

3296
02:53:47,250 --> 02:53:48,090
It's okay.

3297
02:53:52,150 --> 02:53:53,830
SqueakyBoosh, it was your birthday yesterday.

3298
02:53:54,090 --> 02:53:55,090
Happy belated birthday!

3299
02:53:55,930 --> 02:53:57,790
Happy birthday to you.

3300
02:53:58,130 --> 02:53:59,930
Happy birthday to you.

3301
02:53:59,930 --> 02:54:03,110
Happy birthday, SqueakyMoose.

3302
02:54:03,470 --> 02:54:05,870
Happy birthday to you.

3303
02:54:10,110 --> 02:54:12,070
Their memory will remain in the VOD.

3304
02:54:12,270 --> 02:54:13,810
Yes, we salute thee.

3305
02:54:18,070 --> 02:54:19,930
But yeah, thank you guys.

3306
02:54:20,650 --> 02:54:21,350
Thank you.

3307
02:54:21,430 --> 02:54:22,590
I had so much fun.

3308
02:54:23,830 --> 02:54:26,430
And if I see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow.

3309
02:54:26,550 --> 02:54:29,050
And if I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see you next time I see you.

3310
02:54:29,050 --> 02:54:32,250
And I'm going to go to my important meeting.

3311
02:54:33,530 --> 02:54:35,650
I won't miss it this time.

3312
02:54:39,390 --> 02:54:40,430
I can't.

3313
02:54:43,070 --> 02:54:43,590
Otsumito!

3314
02:54:43,590 --> 02:54:44,110
Otsumito!

3315
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:45,610
Thank you guys.

3316
02:54:45,710 --> 02:54:47,250
Have a good day.

3317
02:54:47,290 --> 02:54:47,950
Have a good night.

3318
02:54:48,710 --> 02:54:49,830
Thank you guys.

3319
02:54:55,510 --> 02:54:56,910
I'm just going to exit out of the game.

3320
02:54:57,870 --> 02:54:58,530
OK.

3321
02:54:58,850 --> 02:54:59,070
Yeah.

3322
02:54:59,410 --> 02:54:59,710
Bye!

3323
02:55:08,090 --> 02:55:08,750
Sorry.

3324
02:55:09,030 --> 02:55:09,290
Bye!
