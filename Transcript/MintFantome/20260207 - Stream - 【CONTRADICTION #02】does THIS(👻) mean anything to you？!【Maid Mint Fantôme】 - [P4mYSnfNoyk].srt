Bye bye bye!

4

Wait!

9
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,440

10
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,440

Welcome in, welcome in!

14
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,140
Howdy dody!

15
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,900
She almost bore Gore the drip!

16
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,300
I know!

17
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,980
What would I...

18
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,320
Wait.

19
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Wait.

20
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,580
Wait.

21
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,360
Oop.

22
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,710
Oh yeah!

23
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,830
Oh yeah!

24
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,450
Does this hat mean anything to you?

25
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:38,670
you?

26
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,670
Does anybody know about this hat?

27
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,510
Does anybody know about this bike?

28
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,650
Does anyone know about this ghost?

29
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,270
Ni hao-di.

30
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,390
Ni hao-di.

31
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,950
Welcome, welcome, welcome back to Contradiction.

32
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,810
Wait a second.

33
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,190
It says progress is 37%.

34
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,030
Cheats!

35
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,670
Cheats?

36
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,650
Wait, am I not almost done with this game?

37
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,190
Wait, We're not almost, like a couple, wait.

38
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,220
Wait.

39
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,370
Infinite bikes.

40
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,730
I wonder what...

41
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,690
I wonder what cheats there are.

42
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,290
37 seems low.

43
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,530
I feel like...

44
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,970
Well, maybe we won't finish today.

45
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,570
Oh, no.

46
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,530
This is only day one of 45.

47
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,510
Oh, yeah, 37% is the progress on chapter.

48
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,530
after one, of course.

49
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,890
No, I'm just kidding.

50
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,750
Well, if we don't finish today, that's okay.

51
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,410
I had another stream earlier.

52
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,930
I'm a little bit, after that, I'm a little bit.

53
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,090
Wait, why did I make that noise?

54
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,490
I was trying, sorry, I was trying to snore.

55
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:22,350
I'm feeling a little, If I did this eats an entire turkey
dinner in 30 minutes, would that mean anything to you?

56
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,530
It would mean you're hungry.

57
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,490
What did I have for dinner?

58
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,090
A potato.

59
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,750
Yeah, it has been a long day for me.

60
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,070
Yeah, it has been.

61
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,490
I, uh...

62
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:48,830
I woke up and, well, the night before, I was up late
finishing some things that needed to get done that day.

63
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,910
Then I woke up and was hit with a couple things that needed
to get done in the morning.

64
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:03,770
So I was like, I was rushing around this morning.

65
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,130
I'll just go until I feel like it.

66
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:18,630
It could be that I have a second the game you know some days
i'm a little you know some days i'm feeling strong enough to

67
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:29,250
go for many many times and some days my spiritual energy is
lower so it is what it is everybody has those times but

68
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:42,310
contradiction where did we end off on trying to think
finding the silver key no definitely not okay watching the

69
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:55,670
DVD we did the DVD that was xxx oh yeah and progress will be
what it will be exactly and if I don't beat it today we'll

70
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:06,810
beat it in a couple days so yeah we met the guy's dad uh did

71
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:18,110
you know about Simon's homebrew yet nobody will let me try
it I'm in Just discovered you in Doki over Christmas and

72
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,590
love your stream.

73
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,530
So I wanted to say hello.

74
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,250
Also, is there any sort of ritual to summon you?

75
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,830
TG, thank you!

76
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,130
The ritual.

77
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,700
No, I guess you could...

78
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,360
Oh, anything with a circle of metal gear, probably.

79
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,060
Like a summoning circle.

80
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,660
Fun fact.

81
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,440
Janks.

82
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,660
I was about to say, isn't his name jerks?

83
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,360
Chanks wasn't supposed to have a hat His actor Rupert Booth
showed up to film with a hat on And the developer decided to

84
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,660
throw it in It fits him so well Minto, do you know anything
about Magic Mint?

85
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:14,820
I should learn some magic tricks or two So I can be a Magic
Mint too I even thought I'd been lurking for a few years Now

86
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,940
I'm figuring my 30th birthday Would be a good time to break
that streak Thanks for keeping our spirits high all these

87
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,180
years.

88
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,160
You're the best boss.

89
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,160
Squint, happy birthday!

90
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,060
Oh my gosh!

91
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,380
You're coming out in the big three.

92
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh my gosh.

93
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,400
Happy birthday!

94
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,580
Let us know and we will complete the ritual.

95
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Not the goats.

96
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,020
I once had a dream that there were three goats telling me to
complete a ritual.

97
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,840
And I kept doing other things.

98
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,160
And the goats would be like, Wait, hold on.

99
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,990
The goats would be like...

100
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:55,540
No!

101
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,360
Me too!

102
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,560
You must finish the ritual!

103
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,620
No,

104
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,000
I had a dream like that.

105
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,800
And now, anytime...

106
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,380
Oh my goodness, sorry.

107
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,440
Anytime a ritual is brought up, it's like the goats are also
brought up.

108
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,060
It was so funny.

109
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,640
Well, shall we resume and see?

110
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,760
I'm going to resume the game.

111
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,280
We're at 8 p.m.

112
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,700
I think we have until...

113
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,140
Wait a second.

114
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,080
I think what I remember of this is we have until midnight,
no?

115
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,520
Deep mint?

116
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,420
Deep mint?

117
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,000
midnight.

118
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
So that's another four hours now, isn't it?

119
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,460
And we've seen how long these hours have lasted.

120
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:57,980
Oh.

121
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,020
Hello, Minto and Ibu's IQ!

122
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,460
To be honest, I don't remember if I sent my daily Minto and
Ibu's IQ super chat, so I'm sending this just in case.

123
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,360
I thought you did though, Calmo.

124
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,420
Let's contradict this.

125
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,980
Contradict, shall we?

126
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,940
Yeah!

127
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,440
Yeah, the case closes at the end of the day for some reason.

128
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,840
I don't know why I thought at 10 p.m.

129
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,900
I don't know maybe we won't finish today but that's okay i'm
really sorry i kept it i think on the schedule and

130
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:33,060
everything i was like the thrilling conclusion but that's
all right let's see um paul and ryan both needed to need to

131
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:40,060
be asked about the dvd there are also things you haven't
asked james ryan and paul about yeah oh gosh there's

132
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,760
people's names i have to go back to paul and ryan's house

133
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,570
house.

134
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,790
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

135
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,530
Oh, we're at Paul.

136
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,750
Okay, I was like, wait a second, where am I?

137
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,790
Where am I?

138
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:10,030
Okay, so we... Sorry, I'm getting my bearings of what things
we've asked.

139
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,430
Okay, so let's start with the doll burning ceremony.

140
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,890
So this is the father, right, of Ryan.

141
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:26,130
Just, okay, let me, for anybody who's, uh, needs a little
reminder, which is also mean a girl died in a lake or a

142
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:45,170
girl's body was found in a lake and uh so we are detective
jenks and we're in this small town and um sorry someone said

143
00:14:45,170 --> 00:15:00,230
skeddy doll oh dorko he said of look like these noodles that
I found that are spaghetti noodles but it just says hidden

144
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:07,310
vegetables and I think it's because they're partially made
with vegetables like they have instead of just like you know

145
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:19,690
regular spaghetti it's awesome and also is made with
vegetables and so the noodles are called hidden vegetables

146
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,470
spaghetti.

147
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,810
Everybody eat your hidden vegetables.

148
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,170
Sorry.

149
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,330
The noodles looked exactly like the spaghetti.

150
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,110
Wait.

151
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,930
No, sorry.

152
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,850
The doll looked exactly like

153
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,740
sorry.

154
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,460
The doll looked exactly like the noodles.

155
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,340
Hidden vegetables.

156
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,180
Musketi doll ate the veggies so they're in its belly.

157
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,520
Nah, she's got a snatched waist.

158
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,400
Look at that.

159
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,560
Okay, sorry.

160
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,020
You don't need magic mint when you've got sleep deprivation
mint.

161
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't you think it's funny that it's called hidden
vegetables?

162
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,120
I feel like I'm six years old when I eat them.

163
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,930
Hidden Vegetables.

164
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,050
You must hide the veggies.

165
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:41,270
It's like when they hide the veggies within like a meal,
within like a bunch of cheese to trick the children into

166
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,050
eating it.

167
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,350
Or a dog.

168
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,410
Oh, crouching tiger hidden vegetables.

169
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,750
Anyway, okay, sorry.

170
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,270
Crouching fruit hidden vegetables.

171
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,070
I don't find it that funny, unfortunately.

172
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:08,990
Sorry.

173
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,470
You might be new here.

174
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,450
I laugh at things.

175
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,280
Anyway.

176
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,180
Sorry.

177
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:26,960
Murder.

178
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,340
The girl was killed.

179
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:42,900
uh uh the girl died the girl died uh that's not so funny but
this game is pretty funny um and we're in this town and it

180
00:17:42,900 --> 00:18:03,260
turns out that she uh was a member of this society sorry not
society this business seminar that teaches you business and

181
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:13,540
um they're definitely not a cult uh they're definitely not a
cult yeah they're teaching you business everybody and how to

182
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:25,940
how to throw away your morals your giggles make my day i'm
glad you think so thank you or i'm glad that they do

183
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:40,010
yeah they teach business passionately they they they teach
the finest business and she was a member and then it turns

184
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:50,530
out that there was another guy that was part of this seminar
club this business club that also died a year prior to this

185
00:18:50,530 --> 00:19:04,830
girl and so now we're interrogating the father and founder
the father of what are the the guys who runs the the cult

186
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:17,970
not cult and his father Paul okay let's ask him about the
doll what can you tell me about doll burning at Atlas not

187
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:24,770
very much it's one of Ryan's ideas my son is under the
illusion that he's a genius we're talking to Severus Snape

188
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:42,900
my my son is convinced that he's a genius oh why is seen
this before the writing looks familiar but no he's like I

189
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:53,760
made that with my wife last week auto hypnosis can you tell
me more about the auto hypnosis techniques used on the

190
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:04,180
course we don't use hypnosis on the course not at all not
anymore not anymore so how was it used is probably the wrong

191
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,880
word, Inspector.

192
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,140
It's nothing to do with the trances or things like that.

193
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,600
It was meant to force...

194
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,920
Force?

195
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,860
To help students.

196
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,760
Did you force them?

197
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,240
You can't force anybody into being hypnotized.

198
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,980
You have to want to be hypnotized.

199
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,900
It's not something out of your control.

200
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,920
You can't be hurt or damaged in any way by hypnosis.

201
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,340
So you've never put pressure on students to enter into
hypnosis?

202
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,140
It would be impossible to do so.

203
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,720
I'm being pressured into being hypnotized.

204
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,060
It's kind of true.

205
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,260
Yeah, I've heard that before too.

206
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,460
Like you have to be like susceptible to it.

207
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,380
You can't just be like, I don't want to be hypnotized and
then be hypnotized.

208
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,050
That is what they say.

209
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,030
What do you think differently?

210
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,290
Manga lied to me.

211
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,330
My thin books lied to me.

212
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,670
My dojin-shi say otherwise.

213
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,810
Okay, I think that's everything then to ask him about for
now.

214
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,290
Thank you.

215
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,410
Probably be back later.

216
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,450
I'm going to be using...

217
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,090
Until we get back into the swing of things, I'm going to be
using my tips.

218
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:30,750
So...

219
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,930
Wait, Paul and Ryan both need to be asked about that DVD.

220
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,610
So let's go to Atlas and let's go find Ryan.

221
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,490
Not with the...

222
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,190
My hat!

223
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,010
Not with the...

224
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,990
That's all they took!

225
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,130
It must have been deliberate.

226
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,030
Someone clearly wanted that back.

227
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,630
Nice and helpful of them to leave a piece of evidence
behind, though.

228
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,170
It's not the reusable tote bag.

229
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,410
The reusable grocery bag!

230
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,590
So what do we have now?

231
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,550
What is this?

232
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,750
What is this?

233
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,910
Bag used in mugging.

234
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,410
Monarch costumes!

235
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,490
Bag from a shop called Monarch costumes was used during the
mugging.

236
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,250
Oh, whoops.

237
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,570
My bad.

238
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,270
To Atlas.

239
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,730
He's bald.

240
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,070
He's bald.

241
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:37,110
If he took off his hat, what if he what if I just put on my
hat and he lost it for this whole stream?

242
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,550
That would be crazy.

243
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,550
What was in the court?

244
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,350
Oh, this is the kitchen.

245
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:42,850
That's right.

246
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,230
This is where we found the DVD.

247
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,730
Leave the kitchen.

248
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:51,850
Why did...

249
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,270
So the DVD was of some guy like...

250
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,570
Or some person...

251
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,090
Uh...

252
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,790
Rummaging through people's things.

253
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,390
And being a little freak and stealing their stuff.

254
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,650
Oh, Ryan!

255
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,550
Let me in!

256
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,110
Excuse me!

257
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,910
Where are you?

258
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,530
Where could he be?

259
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,470
Okay, hold on.

260
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:16,930
What else?

261
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,770
Things that you haven't asked, Simon, Emma, James, Rebecca,
Ryan, and Paul.

262
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,310
Oh, that FOB?

263
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,170
That FOB looks like it...

264
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,070
Oh, the FOB!

265
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,790
The FOB!

266
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,330
Did you steal his hat?

267
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,070
No.

268
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,850
It looks too good on him.

269
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,410
I couldn't.

270
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,040
Then it would mean you stole his hat.

271
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,920
No, I did.

272
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,440
I didn't!

273
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,400
I didn't!

274
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,300
FOB!

275
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,780
FOB!

276
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,900
FOB!

277
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,790
Um...

278
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,150
Maybe?

279
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,470
Okay, there was...

280
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,730
I think I know where it goes to.

281
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,290
Let's go back here.

282
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,130
Behind the house.

283
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,380
Let's use it here.

284
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,380
The fob.

285
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,120
Oh!

286
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,500
I hope they don't hear that.

287
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,650
Looks pretty normal.

288
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,310
So, those are Ryan's guitars.

289
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,770
Kept in a garage.

290
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,970
Not really the best place to keep them.

291
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,330
Dan, do not move these.

292
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,390
Dan, don't move my guitars.

293
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,830
Ryan's guitars.

294
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:38,410
Is that...

295
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,690
Okay.

296
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,590
Collection of guitars belonging to Ryan was seen in the
garage at Brandon House.

297
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,270
Alright.

298
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,430
Interesting.

299
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,010
Kept in the garage.

300
00:24:51,550 --> 00:25:02,850
the garage okay now we have to go to every single person
once again and ask them about every single thing that we

301
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:13,470
have discovered since we last talked to every single person
that we last talked to okay a few more questions if you

307
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,450
So yeah.

308
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,030
Oh, I just remembered something.

309
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,030
I gotta...

310
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,230
Wait.

311
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,130
Ah, I just remembered something else I gotta do.

312
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,010
Okay, anyway, I'll... I'll...

313
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,350
What do you know about doll burning?

314
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,930
Doll burning?

315
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,990
What sort of doll burning?

316
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,990
It doesn't mean anything to you.

317
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:15,490
No.

318
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,350
Should it?

319
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,390
No, that's okay.

320
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:34,650
I think he doesn't know anything atlas auto hypnosis ever
heard of auto hypnosis James self-hypnosis yeah and what do

321
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,990
you know about he does know something it's another name for
scrying some people call it auto hypnosis I call it scrying

322
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:50,650
right so you're saying scrying is just self-hypnosis scrying
you can scry on anything I don't use right now I can scribe

323
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:59,890
watching the clouds maybe the water on a lake in the
moonlight and when you're watching the water what happens

324
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:10,110
you go into a trance you lose yourself in your unconscious
you go deeper and deeper you swim around try not to go too

325
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:19,750
deep because if you go too deep start drowning you get
dragged down to the bottom as long as you stay coming to the

326
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,010
surface again.

327
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,890
Then you wake up and see the world as it really is.

328
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,190
It's like a journey to a place people talk about, but no
one's ever seen.

329
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,910
You're thinking about Case, aren't you?

330
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,250
What makes you say that?

331
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,130

Sold her one last year.

333
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,690
Was she into using mirrors like that?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,030
No idea, but she bought one.

336
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:43,850

ally.

353
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,150
Okay, now time to go talk to Simon.

354
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,330
Simon keeps getting weirder and weirder.

355
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,110
And Emma.

356
00:28:53,070 --> 00:29:03,610
couple more questions if that's okay all right oh we are
gonna ask about Ryan's guitars okay um for let's see doll

357
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:12,670
burning auto hypnosis he did tell us about the auto hypnosis
do you know this bag you've seen this you know the shop yeah

358
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:19,210
yeah I know the shop I had something from them last year I
think this is for a party I assume yeah yeah something like

359
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:26,990
that something like the hired a costume from the shop last
year

360
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:48,750
is it a robe type costume that you might have bought from
said costume store and maybe with a freaky mask yeah was it

361
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:54,930
from the section called cult cult items perhaps

362
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,010
Hmm.

363
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,870
What do you know about Ryan's guitar collection?

364
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,230
Not a whole lot.

365
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,930
I know he brought a guitar to one of the groups once, at the
end of one of the stages.

366
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,770
That's the only time I've seen him with a guitar.

367
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,630
Modern day Elvis.

368
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,810
Let's go see what Emo says.

369
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,210
Be back later on, if that's okay.

370
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,190
Mm-hmm.

371
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,210
Mm-hmm.

372
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:40,230
uh go the shop have you used it no but i know where it is
would you tell me where it is what do you know about ryan's

373
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:48,690
guitar collection i know he plays because he tried to buy
one off me do you play what i used to i used to be in a band

374
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:57,110
but i was a singer as well so i got away with it singer as
well yeah i used to sing in the band every night but uh

375
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,110
Sometimes it was in a pub, but usually at Rebecca's.

376
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,510
What was that called?

377
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,330
It was called Blackstone.

378
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:11,550
And this guy from a record company once came to see us, and
he said the band was rubbish, but that I was good.

379
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,670
So after that, I don't think they liked me much, and then we
broke up after college.

380
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:17,950
Can't high talent.

381
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,250
Why'd he say it like that?

382
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:30,270
Wait, so what did she say about, didn't know Liam very well,
but you were in the band with him excuse me that's a

383
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:41,030
contradiction yeah I remember that what band you sang in
Blackstone who else was in the band just a few people from

384
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:48,550
college including Liam James guy sounds like awful lot like
a drood why did you say you didn't know him no it's not that

385
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,450
I just thought you meant that I didn't know about his
suicide did you?

386
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,110
no I was...

387
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,910
Away on holiday.

388
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,110
When he died?

389
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,050
Yeah, I only knew him through the band.

390
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,310
She definitely knows more than she's saying.

391
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,290
She was in the band with Liam, but didn't know about his
problem.

392
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:07,830
Bruh.

393
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,670
Not sure I believe you, Emma.

394
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,510
Not sure I believe you.

395
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,030
Emma has lied to us, I think, the most out of anybody in
this game so far.

396
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,870
Only knew Liam through the band Blackstone was on holiday
the night Liam died.

397
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,010
I don't remember if we know anything else about...

398
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,520
We didn't mention his problem either.

399
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,540
I feel like there might be something else, but I don't know
where to hit her with it.

400
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,380
For now, we leave.

401
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,360
Okay, that's it for now.

402
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,560
Okay, bye bye.

403
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,340
See you.

404
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
Crawls out her window.

405
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,660
Rebecca, okay, Rebecca, sorry.

406
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,440

Ryan is nine years old.

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,420
Thank you.

425
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,720

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,920
Thank you.

427
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,900
Thank you.

428
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,500
All right.

429
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,920
Let's go back to Paul and Ryan.

430
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,660
Paul and Ryan.

431
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,300
Eh.

432
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,100
Ask you a couple more things.

433
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,860
Yeah, he does need to, he needs to practice.

434
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,540
Have you seen this before?

435
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,940
No, I don't think so.

436
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,540
You don't recognize the shop?

437
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:14,960
No.

438
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,200
Is there someone else who works at Atlas, someone who may
have been there tonight?

439
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:20,740
No.

440
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,740
Is there a cleaner?

441
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,600
A cleaner?

442
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,260
Comes at strange times, but then he's a strange boy.

443
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,100
Work experience.

444
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,220
Why do I like the mean lady so much, am I okay?

445
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,280
and it counts, but it didn't work out.

446
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,580
You are just a masochist, maybe.

447
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm glad that this game could help you recognize that.

448
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,600
Didn't he already say that shop that he uses that shop for
props?

449
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,020
Oh, let me see.

450
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,780
Let me see.

451
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,080
Maybe the the

452
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:23,340
mask thinks it's from monarch but he doesn't know where the
bag is you're so right aha do you visit monarch costumes a

453
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:31,980
lot no I used to go in there occasionally why but you do
know the shop yes of course I do you see Paul I thought you

454
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:41,300
said you didn't know where this bag was from well maybe I do
why would you say you don't used to put over my head paul

455
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:48,180
buy a mugger would you like to tell me something are you
suggesting that i had something to do with your mugging did

456
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:56,620
you did you you really ask the most ridiculous questions of
course i didn't so why did you lie about yeah it's literally

457
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:04,260
written on in fact i didn't have anything to do with your
mugging inspector but i might know somebody who did go on go

458
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:13,380
on mention jason to you as a cleaner oh yeah you know you
did actually At some point, told Jason that the DVD mustn't

459
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,760
be removed from the site.

460
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:25,320
So, when he saw you take it, he simply thought that he was
doing us a favour by, well, getting it back.

461
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,880
That's weird.

462
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,120
He isn't exactly what you'd call one of Darwin's best
examples.

463
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,780
Oh, my God!

464
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,980
So what's on the DVD that's so special?

465
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,360
All right, it was something I did myself a little stunt I
pulled to amuse the students.

466
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,820
I pretended to steal from the students.

467
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,780
I emphasized the word pretended.

468
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,780
The students knew all about it afterwards.

469
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
Everything was above board.

470
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:48,980
Oh, right.

471
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,100
Steal from students.

472
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,360
Why?

473
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,280
We were doing a piece about pushing the limit, so I decided
I, I would show them how it was done.

474
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,780
Oh, don't look so serious, Inspector.

475
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,180
I returned everybody's things immediately afterwards, no
harm done.

476
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,020
And when was this?

477
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,460
Last year sometime.

478
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,660
It was just a prank, bro.

479
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:08,920
A third eye?

480
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,040
Atlas.

481
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,900
Third eye, I think.

482
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,940
And this was before or after Liam died.

483
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,040
Well, since you'll probably find out anyway, it happened to
be on the night that Liam died as it happens.

484
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:27,200
Before you ask, no, I didn't steal from him.

485
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,400
You seem so proud of yourself.

486
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,680
Do you think it's a good idea to encourage students to
steal, Paul?

487
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,620
I wasn't encouraging students to steal.

488
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,080
Policemen are so literal.

489
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,920
It is shades of grey, Inspector.

490
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,460
Much as the Force might like it, it doesn't divide neatly
into blacks and whites.

491
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,200
Now, if you don't mind, you'd have to excuse me for a
moment.

492
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,660
You know where the door is.

493
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:55,980
Oh!

494
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,980
You know where the door is?

495
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,520
Wow.

496
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,200
I'm pretending to steal.

497
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,460
I'm pretending to steal.

498
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,360
You see, he was quick enough to claim he didn't steal from
Liam.

499
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,580
What kind of stunt was that anyway?

500
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,140
And Liam dying later the same night is just all a bit too
suspicious.

501
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,160
I agree, I agree.

502
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Liam was heartbroken he wasn't stolen from.

503
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,800
Okay, now we...

504
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh wait, oops.

505
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,660
We have to go back to Atlas?

506
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,440
I'm trying to find this dang guy.

507
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,060
Maybe he's in the restaurant.

508
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,600
Maybe Ryan is getting a thick, juicy burger.

509
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,200
Actually, what do they sell?

510
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:49,140

Okay, anyway.

Uh, we're heading to...

519
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,070
Atlas again.

520
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,010
One more time, baby.

521
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,390
Gotta find this guy.

522
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,870
Ryan, open up!

523
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,510
This is the police!

524
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,330
He's not here.

525
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:19,990
Hint.

526
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,210
Simon, Emma, Rebecca, Ryan, and Paul yet.

527
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:23,810
What?

528
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,710
There is more stuff?

529
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,110
So many people, wait, what did I not ask about?

530
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,770
Oh, the theft stunt!

531
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,170
That's right.

532
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,050
I forgot we got the new...

533
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,890
Just a few more questions, if you don't mind.

534
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,850
This guy comes back...

535
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:46,850
Drawing.

536
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,730
This guy comes back every 20 minutes.

537
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,810
I can't stand him anymore.

538
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,170
What do you know about Paul stealing money from students?

539
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,310
Part of a stunt or something?

540
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:55,850
Did he do that?

541
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,430
I've never heard about anything like that.

542
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,390
No, it might be part of the risk-taking thing, though.

543
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,130
The risk-taking.

544
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:02,790
Explain that.

545
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,990
Well, it's part of the course.

546
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:09,090
You have to do something dangerous or risky, something you
wouldn't normally do.

547
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,410
Something dangerous?

548
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,070
Well, not dangerous, just risky.

549
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:18,690
Like, saying something you wouldn't normally say to someone,
or doing something unusual.

550
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,770
Like stealing from other students.

551
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:21,590
Like...

552
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,750
We didn't do anything like that.

553
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,910
Doing a dance in public.

554
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:31,910
of the course anyway and you're not allowed to do anything
that would hurt or offend anyone or you're not allowed to do

555
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:41,870
anything really bad it's all pretend really it's just a bit
old for a business course it works though finally finally

556
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:51,730
someone acknowledges it this is strange for a business
course this is weird for a business course thank you

557
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,730
probably be back later why are we

558
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:06,470
masks what do you know about Paul Rand Paul the slime you've
obviously met him then yes I am I was reincarnated what do

559
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:11,770
you know about him committing a fake theft during one of the
courses what about him going through people's bags yeah you

560
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:20,550
try that thing on me as well weirdo what so you were at
third eye yes yes I I went there for a few months after

561
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:27,010
college and I left because I hated it and I didn't know
Atlas was the same thing and i went with simon does simon

562
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:37,670
know that no i didn't want to burst his bubble so i didn't
say anything so he doesn't know you went to third eye no ah

563
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:46,370
so is that where you met ryan as well yep right what uh what
didn't you like about the course well it was just he hates

564
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:51,750
telling the truth it was stupid they just made you do things
to other people and be abusive just to prove that you could

565
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:58,090
and i absolutely hated it what sort of things oh just just
stupid things, nasty things to prove that you could do it.

566
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,370
It was about not feeling guilty.

567
00:43:59,590 --> 00:43:59,910
Ah.

568
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,910
And it was horrible, that's why I left.

569
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,970
And is Simon doing all of this stuff now?

570
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:04,490
No.

571
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,710
No, I think they had to stop because it was just getting
ridiculous.

572
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,770
I think somebody got arrested or something.

573
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:10,830
Very interesting.

574
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,510
Who got arrested?

575
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,230
Join Third Eye after leaving college.

576
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,070
Was at Third Eye when Paul pulled the stunt.

577
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:22,950
Simon doesn't know Emma.

578
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:23,990
Wait, OK, hold on.

579
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:34,630
Liam only knew him through the band Blackstone but she went
to Third Eye

580
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:51,590
no because he was because Liam was also at Third Eye so she
would have known him I don't know what you're about this all

581
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,370
sounds perfectly in line with high end businessmen

582
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:04,170
hmm hmm But only knew him through banned Blackstone.

583
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,370
But also, she said she was on holiday.

584
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,530
He did that the same night he died.

585
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11,370
Okay, hold on.

586
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,850
Okay, there's multiple things we got here on her.

587
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:14,790
Oh my gosh.

588
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:16,370
Wait.

589
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,450
Was on holiday?

590
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,130
Was that third eye when Paul pulled the stunt?

591
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:23,690
There we go.

592
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,410
We got him.

593
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,830
So, you witnessed Paul's money-stealing stunt.

594
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,410
Is that right?

595
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,090
Yes.

596
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,010
But you weren't there when Liam died.

597
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:40,150
Don't quite understand that, you see, because Paul pulled
the stunt on the same night.

598
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,090
Liam died later that evening.

599
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,050
Why is he always lying?

600
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,170
I must have mixed up.

601
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:49,150
So you don't know anything about Liam's death, even though
you were there on that night?

602
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,310
No.

603
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:51,330
Emma.

604
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,550
I think you better explain, don't you?

605
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,310
Well, it's the stupid course.

606
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:10,850
it oh my god we were all told to do stupid things and and
then that thieving thing happened and so take a breath I

607
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:28,930
can't I can't believe I was Liam killed himself because of
me why um Liam had a a birthmark on the side of his face did

608
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:39,050
you say it was no one would mention anything even though we
all knew it was there was that your risk they all thought it

609
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:49,510
was ugly oh you've done it so i thought i say something and
i even asked paul if it was okay to say what did he say he

610
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:56,230
said he wouldn't lie and liam killed himself liam's dad
because of me

611
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:05,790
Emma, I'm quite sure you regret what you said, but I really
don't think you caused Liam's death.

612
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,690
There's always more to these things than meets the eye.

613
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:10,570
It wasn't your fault.

614
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,150
We can't tell Simon, please.

615
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,930
There's no tears, by the way.

616
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,990
Thank you.

617
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,050
Not a single tear has rolled down her cheek, by the way.

618
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:26,630
9pm!

619
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:35,090
9 o'clock Poor Emma I suppose it's possible that what she
said led to Liam's death But I really doubt it I blame the

620
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,530
rands before I blame her

621
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,020
Did we get anything from her saying that?

622
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,020
Emma's guilt She said don't tell Simon But what if we My bag

623
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,520
Simon do you know about Emma's guilt?

624
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,540
Do you know about how guilty she feels?

625
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,560
Ask about a few more things, please.

626
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,940
Oh, Jenks has promised not to discuss this with Simon!

627
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,900
He's a man of his word!

628
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,040
Aww.

629
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,320
Straight to snitch.

630
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,660
No, I was testing his loyalty.

631
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,080
And he passed.

632
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,920
He passed the test.

633
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:45,400
how honorable jinx is a good guy a couple more questions if
that's okay all right the theft theft Paul's theft stunt did

634
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:53,980
you know about Paul's money stealing at Atlas are you
talking about a particular incident or just in general it's

635
00:48:53,980 --> 00:49:02,260
something he did on the course stunt and what did he do
exactly oh well he pretended to steal from the students that

636
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,060
doesn't about.

637
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,860
Paul's stunts usually involve throwing fancy dress parties
with scantily clad girls or women dressed as nurses.

638
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,680
That's his usual fetish.

639
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,720
Who's the last party he threw?

640
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,180
Um, sometime in the summer.

641
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,160
I didn't stay long.

642
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,760
What's happening?

643
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,100
And atlas.

644
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,880
Nurse fetish, atabus, discourse.

645
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,180
What's going on?

646
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,800
It's unlikely Rebecca would know anything about this with
Lin.

647
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,140
Aw.

648
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,880
What is happening?

649
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,760
Last party Paul threw was sometime in the summer.

650
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,580
Paul often throws fancy dress parties.

651
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,400
Be back later on, if that's okay.

652
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,510
Wait, what's this?

653
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,310
Oh, yeah, I think this is the one I need to go to.

654
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,890
Yes, Abbey Farm.

655
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,430
There we go.

656
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:06,590
Just a business course.

657
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,250
I wonder if we're going to be able to go to the...

658
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:21,270
It's better go to the costume store James wouldn't know
James wouldn't know okay Can I come in and ask you a few

659
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,530
questions rummaging through my notes.

660
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,290
You know what never mind.

661
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:31,910
Bye-bye Okay Back to Paul and Ryan.

662
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,630
I haven't seen Ryan in so long Where's this guy at?

663
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,890
Maybe he's back here.

664
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,790
Orion, Orion, where are you?

665
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:45,950
Ryan.

666
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,710
Ryan must be lonely, I think so.

667
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,210
Ask you a couple more things, please.

668
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,770
I don't think he was the one that mugged us.

669
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,650
Actually, the guy who mugged us wasn't wearing a mask or
anything.

670
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,590
Oh, I forgot to ask about the guitar.

671
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,130
Oh, wait, I think he kicked us out before we could ask about
the guitars.

672
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,970
Does Ryan play the guitar?

673
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,210
Ryan?

674
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:19,230
Ryan couldn't get a tune out of a radio.

675
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,410
He's turned deaf.

676
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,750
Try the Alice location at 90 and now.

677
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:22,310
Oh, true!

678
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,550
Then maybe they're done with their ceremony.

679
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:25,990
It was never going to happen.

680
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,430
Ryan can't play the guitar.

681
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,410
Ryan couldn't have become professional.

682
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,250
Oh, my God.

683
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:38,990
Dang.

684
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,410
Do you think Emma's criticism of Liam on that last night led
to his suicide?

685
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,150
I doubt it helped.

686
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,210
Do you encourage Emma to criticize him?

687
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,990
I didn't encourage Emma to do anything.

688
00:51:53,990 --> 00:52:00,350
I merely told her what we told every student to do to
express themselves as they wanted.

689
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:05,450
And so she wanted to express how ugly the birth mark was.

690
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:06,390
Wouldn't it?

691
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:11,830
However, I didn't expect her to criticize his...

692
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:27,970
birthmark if that's what it was that's a decision she took
herself so you didn't know her well no not at all hardly

693
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:39,390
knew Emma I think we know that that's a contradiction with
the necklace bought a freedom necklace for a student maybe

694
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:51,910
yes huh and yet you say you didn't know emma uh yet you
bought her a freedom necklace i don't remember saying

695
00:52:51,910 --> 00:53:01,710
anything about buying emma a necklace so you didn't buy her
one so you did buy her one so that means you must have known

696
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:10,190
her and quite well too stop making such a big thing about
this inspector look i've been around a few years the clock

697
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,530
is ticking And I admit I have an embarrassing weakness.

698
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,210
For nurses.

699
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,070
For attractive women.

700
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:19,950
And nurses.

701
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:20,970
It was a stupid mistake.

702
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:21,850
Attractive women and nurses.

703
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,990
But that's all it was.

704
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,550
So you're saying you tried it on with her?

705
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,590
No, I didn't try it on.

706
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:33,190
I bought her a necklace.

707
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:41,830
I'm not aware that there's a law against buying presents,
unless, of course, the Third Reich has been elected.

708
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:49,050
if that's a crime locked me up being attracted to emma was
old enough to make decisions liking attractive women and as

709
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:56,210
a matter of fact she decided that she didn't want to be
bothered as an old fool like me so nothing happened no

710
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:04,830
mistakes nobody got hurt all right like father like son no
surprise did she sleep yeah did she sleep with the dad and

711
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:11,330
the side paul has tried it on with like father like son

712
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,850
Once tried to date, but...

713
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,210
Don't say, oh Yakodon.

714
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:25,270
Emma!

715
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,270
Alright, let's head to Atlas.

716
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:42,710
Atlas!

717
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,710
Man.

718
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,690
Emma is the talk of the town, it seems.

719
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,570
Oh, were these here before?

720
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,190
Were those boxes there before, or...

721
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,030
Maybe there's something new in here?

722
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,890
I feel like I'm playing an anomaly again.

723
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,210
Were these things here before?

724
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,330
Did that thing move?

725
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,490
Was that chair always that color?

726
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:13,590
Ah!

727
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:21,890
The door...

728
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:22,870
Okay, they are out.

729
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,250
Awesome.

730
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,010
Is the ceremony finished?

731
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:28,750
Oh, I'll clean.

732
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:33,570
No more doll burning in here.

733
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,710
Mito, show us your Mito's.

734
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,210
No, thank you.

735
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:41,530
Not cannibalism.

736
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,710
54 minute for generational double-tip.

737
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,630
A few more questions if you don't mind.

738
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:54,310
Okay, we have so much to ask Ryan right now.

739
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,430
Holy cow.

740
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:01,230
Okay, we're starting at the doll burning ceremony.

741
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,030
So tell me more about this doll burning.

742
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:06,970
It's a symbolic ceremony.

743
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,690
We perform every few weeks on the course.

744
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:09,770
What's it about?

745
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,850
It's about burning your old personality and finding a new
one, a better one.

746
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,550
So the dolls are...

747
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:17,890
The dolls are my personality.

748
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,150
They represent you from the past.

749
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:24,730
Each doll has a picture of a student as a child or a
teenager.

750
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,310
they burn the doll and symbolically destroy their old
personality.

751
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,210
It's quite simple but effective, I find.

752
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,210
And why did that girl shout?

753
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,070
Because it's an emotional thing.

754
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:39,310
She quite clearly become very attached to her doll.

755
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,290
They do spend the first month with them.

756
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:46,810
We tell them to take the doll everywhere with them before
they actually go through the doll burning.

757
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,170
And you believe that's a good thing?

758
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:50,390
Destroying your past?

759
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,470
It's like when they give you an egg.

760
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,050
Of course it's a good thing, Inspector.

761
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,730
Tell us to say that it's your baby.

762
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:59,550
We're all shackled to our past, particularly you by the
sound of it, perhaps.

763
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,490
Perhaps we should make it all of you, Inspector, and burn
that, what do you think?

764
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:04,570
No, thank you.

765
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,550
You're probably right.

766
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,150
I'm not sure it would do any good anyway.

767
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,850
But what if I prefer my Skeddy personality?

768
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,710
But Skeddy, Spaghetti is my whole personality.

769
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:22,790
Oh, Hamito.

770
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:28,390
So sassy.

771
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,300
He almost took a sip there.

772
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:37,550
Hi.

773
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:43,330
It's like when they give you an egg in school and they're
like, this is your baby, now you have to take care of it.

774
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,710
And if it dies, you fail.

775
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,650
And you become attached to your baby egg.

776
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,370
I don't hit nervous.

777
00:57:54,670 --> 00:58:02,310
Can you tell me about auto hypnosis well what would you like
to know do you use it on the course we dip into it

778
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:08,650
occasionally but it's not a major feature of the course I
would say that well a minority of the students know how to

779
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:14,370
use it but the majority wouldn't know and have a clue it's
not a requirement of the course no not at all we don't we

780
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:22,270
don't ask people to do things that they're not comfortable
with there's no bribery no coercion we're thinking about

781
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:30,210
phasing auto hypnosis out actually Well, to be perfectly
honest with you, Inspector, it doesn't actually work very

782
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:30,510
well.

783
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,730
I think that's a lie.

784
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,130
Believes auto-hypnosis doesn't work.

785
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:36,530
Okay, hold on.

786
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,010
Let's check the scry...

787
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:39,470
What do you say?

788
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,140
Hmm.

789
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:54,700
Hmm.

790
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,130
Oh, my God.

791
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:04,710
There's so much.

792
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:14,490
If you don't believe in auto-hypnosis, then how do you
explain your good thoughts?

793
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,770
I didn't realize you were a musician.

794
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,190
Oh, well, I'm not really a musician.

795
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,330
I mean, I dabble a little bit.

796
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,930
To be quite honest with you, I'm far more interested in
collecting guitars.

797
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,090
You're not in a band.

798
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,830
Well, I did audition.

799
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,530
I did audition a few years ago.

800
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,650
What I say a few years ago, of course, I mean about 20 years
ago.

801
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,710
Doesn't time fly?

802
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,130
20 years.

803
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:41,490
What was that?

804
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,530
Oh, I can't remember.

805
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:44,450
Something's stone.

806
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,590
Aren't they all called something stone?

807
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,310
Hammerstone.

808
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:48,230
That's it.

809
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,170
And you still collect?

810
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,310
Hammerstone, huh?

811
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,250
I haven't bought a guitar for over a year.

812
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:54,170
I feel I've moved on.

813
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,850
20 years?

814
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,930
One's auditioned for a band called Hammerstone.

815
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:01,630
Okay, hold on.

816
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,150
Let's see if he knows anything about...

817
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,310
What is it, Blackstone?

818
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,680
Uh...

819
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,120
Uh...

820
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,690
I'm seeing...

821
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,010
Ask him about this.

822
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:42,630
I

823
01:00:47,450 --> 01:01:00,830
guess not hasn't said anything about it all right the bag do
you know what this is well I think it's a bag is it a bag

824
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:08,910
inspector the shop oh yes the costume shop yes we used to
hire from them for the course well yes for the course at the

825
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:16,890
end of each stage we have a little party and we ask students
to dress up or try acting out being somebody new their new

826
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:22,750
selves as it were could you explain a bit more new selves is
all just role-playing one of the main elements of the course

827
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:30,030
is learning how to act how to be you need to be in any given
situation I think you'll agree inspector that business is

828
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:37,750
about being the right person in the right situation at the
right time what he does it helps them to detach themselves

829
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:43,610
become somebody new pretend you know you know the kind of
thing is surprising what a little bit of cross-dressing can

830
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:51,050
do for you inspector you should try it not at this stage hmm
wait what did he just say

831
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:11,670

out my headphones if it's my headphones or my ears Because

833
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,370
I've been wearing my headphones all day.

834
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,330
They're like kind of hurting my ears.

835
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,930
Like my in-ear monitors.

836
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,090
Hold on.

837
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:38,190
And I like had my left one in only.

838
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,130
But the game was really quiet.

839
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:42,170
And I'm like, am I deaf in this ear?

840
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:46,150
Or is it my earbud?

841
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,050
I can't tell.

842
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,600
No, I think it's my earbud.

843
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,460
I don't know why.

844
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:55,000
Hmm.

Maybe they do need to be clean.

849
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,180
Could just be a clog.

850
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,680
Could be.

851
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,560
Too much ecto wax, maybe.

852
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,780
Okay, I'm gonna switch to my other headphones real quick
then.

853
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,020

01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,350
White hair and hearing loss My oh she's getting old.

860
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,180
Okay, anyway, we're moving on.

861
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,880
What do you know about your father's money-stealing stunt?

862
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,660
He's right.

863
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,760
Well, yes, that was something that Dan decided to do as part
of the shock aspect of the course.

864
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:15,840
But he went too far.

865
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:16,520
You believe.

866
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,220
Shock.

867
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,480
He usually does.

868
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,200
And do you think it did have anything to do with Liam's
death?

869
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,540
No, no, no, no.

870
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,520
Liam wasn't like that at all.

871
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:33,680
I mean, that was just a simple I mean, Liam had his own
problems, but he didn't have any problems with the money

872
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,780
shock stunt.

873
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:35,160
No.

874
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,860
Stunt's not related to Liam's suicide.

875
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:48,980
Hmm.

876
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,040
You were shocked!

877
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,220
What do you know about Emma Bowman criticizing Liam before
his suicide?

878
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,720
I was there.

879
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,280
I witnessed it.

880
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:05,940
Uh, well, I know Emma blamed herself for his death.

881
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:14,980
20 years no well she was upset and all of that but um i i
wouldn't blame her inspector i i really don't think she had

882
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:21,940
anything to do with it at all you don't think leon was a
very confident person very outgoing very strong individual

883
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:30,180
or so it seemed i think people are free to do what they like
even something as irreversible as bumping themselves off sad

884
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,660
though that is of course

885
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:40,390
Hmm.

886
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:45,590
Edible, thank you so much for the, for the, for the
Supertown.

887
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:46,390
Thank you.

888
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:48,530
Uh-huh.

889
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:50,850
He's not sus at all.

890
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:54,210
I know he's, it seems to be getting kind of flustered about
it.

891
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,790
Let's see what about, I'll let, um.

892
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:00,370
Seemed happy.

893
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,290
Liam was strong and outgoing.

894
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,730
Makes people are free to do what they like.

895
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,060
That's it for the time meeting.

896
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:22,560
Thank you.

897
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,560
Did I get everybody?

898
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,980
Hold on, I'm gonna...

899
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,000
Did I get...

900
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,040
What happens after an Atlas meeting?

901
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,040
I don't know.

902
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,640
What happens after they go home?

903
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,240
Um...

904
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,540
We went to the reading room.

905
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:47,600
Already.

906
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,600
Did they hang out in here?

907
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,220
No, we already went in here.

908
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,200
That's my bad.

909
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,140
Do they go to the pub?

910
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,120
Do they go get drinks?

911
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,420
Maybe they're...

912
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,240
Wait, maybe they're in the restaurant now.

913
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,600
Ding ding.

914
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,920
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

915
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,680
Uh, never mind.

916
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,220
Thank you.

917
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,400
Probably be back later.

918
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:27,980
after...

919
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,800
Maybe they all gather in the forest?

920
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,680
That's the only other thing that I could think of.

921
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,220
Let's go here.

922
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,520
Into the clearing?

923
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,120
Are they gathered here?

924
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:39,100
No.

925
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:40,680
There.

926
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,300
Oh, whoops.

927
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:41,700
My bad.

928
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,500
Back to the clearing, back to the junction, back to the
clearing, back to the junction.

929
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,100
To the jetty.

930
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,050
Woods entrance.

931
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,790
To the end...

932
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:02,830
of the path?

933
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,950
What the heck do they do after an Alice meeting?

934
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,350
They all just hang out?

935
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:28,410
Inside?

936
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,970
Oh, I just noticed.

937
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:41,950
That'll come in handy.

938
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,950
I don't know why I never remember to buy

939
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:49,970
one.

940
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:52,430
Wait, did you guys see the glitching or no?

941
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,390
Wait, did you guys see the glitching or no?

942
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,780
Oh, you did it?

943
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,580
Oh, no!

944
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,520
That's why I was going like, whoa!

945
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,180
Was there a place that was dark that we couldn't go to?

946
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,480
Do you know anything about this flashlight?

947
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,300
Wait, oh no, try using this.

948
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,580
Oh, I remember!

949
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,500
I remember at the pub!

950
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:28,920
At the pub!

951
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:29,520
At the pub!

952
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:29,860
At the pub!

953
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,200
At the pub!

954
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:30,520
At the pub!

955
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:31,920
At the pub!

956
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:32,200
At the pub!

957
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:32,880
At the pub!

958
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,520
At the pub!

959
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:33,880
At the pub!

960
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,810
At the pub!

961
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:38,710
At the pub!

962
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:39,190
Here.

963
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:51,770
I remember.

964
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:53,530
Oh?

965
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:54,690
What does that say?

966
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:56,310
Car insurance?

967
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,290
Oh, you don't know.

968
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,150
You just stole that.

969
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,390
You do not know where that's been.

970
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:01,430
Janks.

971
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:04,510
E-will.

972
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,750
Devil worshippers.

973
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,070
Oh well.

974
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:09,090
And there's the mask symbol again.

975
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:09,590
Oh my god, it's Lightning McQueen.

976
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:11,590
Looks like someone's been trying to make a point.

977
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,150
Jenks is not pretending.

978
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:20,690
E-will!

979
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,800
Vandalized car photos.

980
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:34,970
E-will.

981
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,250
E-will.

982
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:41,530
I'm going to see if there's a...

983
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:42,430
If we call the chief.

984
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:43,610
See if it happens.

985
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,150
Okay.

986
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,090
Hmm.

987
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:48,810
He will.

988
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,470
Devil worshippers.

989
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:59,400
I can't tell what's the difference between a busy tone or
its calling.

990
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:04,400
I think.

991
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,220
Never mind.

992
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,500
Time to go ask everybody about the photos.

993
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:17,620
It's better.

994
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,480
A couple more questions, if that's okay.

995
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:34,160
know anything about these nope nope

996
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:52,090
okay bye that's all for the moment thank you do you know
anything nope bugs bunny meme no

997
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:59,310
I know, he's so freaking helpful with anything.

998
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,170
A few more questions, please.

999
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:02,170
Thank you.

1000
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,390
Do you know what these are?

1001
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:10,170
Yes, that's Ryan's car.

1002
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:13,730
Another toy he managed to ruin.

1003
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:14,190
Ruin?

1004
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,210
It was vandalized sometime last year.

1005
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:18,650
You know who did it?

1006
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:22,990
I don't believe anybody was ever prosecuted for it.

1007
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,330
But do you know who did it?

1008
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,310
What do you think you know?

1009
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:33,850
Doesn't think anyone was prosecuted doesn't mean that you
don't have an inkling of an idea of who did it.

1010
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:37,230
Be back later on.

1011
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:40,950
That's a very curious language you're using, mister.

1012
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:44,550
Snape vibes.

1013
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,290
I know!

1014
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:48,730
He has such Snape vibes.

1015
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:50,530
Rebecca's pub.

1016
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,050
Yeah, there's the symbol on the side.

1017
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:54,750
Exactly.

1018
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:02,930
Ding-a-ling!

1019
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,590
Ask you a couple more things, please.

1020
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,090
It's time to go to everybody at the office.

1021
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,130
Have you ever seen these?

1022
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,110
It's Ryan's car.

1023
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:13,410
It got vandalized last year.

1024
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:16,530
His camera had been stolen, so I took pictures.

1025
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,550
Whoever did it made a mess, didn't they?

1026
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:19,490
That game is glitching again.

1027
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,670
But nobody was prosecuted for it.

1028
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,110
Not that I remember.

1029
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:24,750
The insurance paid out, though.

1030
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:28,890
Hmm.

1031
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:29,670
Hmm.

1032
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,470
It's like stuttering, kind of, you know?

1033
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,810
He's a solid snake.

1034
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:39,230
Didn't think anyone was prosecuted.

1035
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,590
Brian's camera had been stolen.

1036
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:43,690
Rebecca took the photos.

1037
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:45,350
Okay, that's it for now.

1038
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:46,030
Thank you.

1039
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,470
All right, to Simon and Emma.

1040
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:52,110
We're going...

1041
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:52,590
Wait a second!

1042
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,030
Back to the main road.

1043
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,510
Do they go to the village hall after the...

1044
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:56,930
No, oops.

1045
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:57,470
Oh, my bad.

1046
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,350
They go to the village hall after.

1047
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:03,890
No.

1048
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:05,090
Never mind.

1049
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,970
Yeah, if it seems fine on stream, that's totally good.

1050
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:11,350
It's just funny for me.

1051
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:15,830
Yeah, back again for a singular question.

1052
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:16,890
Just a few more questions, if you don't mind.

1053
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,530
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

1054
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,390
Have you seen these before?

1055
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:22,290
Hmm.

1056
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,070
No.

1057
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,290
Don't know the car.

1058
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:30,770
And it's always the same thing.

1059
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:43,900
thing do you know this probably be back later okay bye uh
emma do you know do you know anything about these

1060
01:15:47,030 --> 01:16:00,770

she's lying i can't trust literally anything she says

1061
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:13,950

you were dating Ryan and also there's

1065
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,380
Ask about a few more things, please.

1066
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,500
It isn't worth asking Ryan about the red torch that I stole
from his...

1067
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,760
Do you know what...

1068
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,160
Establishment.

1069
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,280
These are.

1070
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,160
Oh, yes.

1071
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,160
That's my old car.

1072
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,900
It was vandalized.

1073
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,960
I took those for the insurance company.

1074
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:00,880
Where did you find those?

1075
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:01,580
At the pub.

1076
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,940
Uh, you know who did this?

1077
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,560
Yes.

1078
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,340
A girl called Lisa Blint.

1079
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,720
She was on the course, a very strange girl.

1080
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:16,580
And why did she write the words, devil worshippers all over
your car?

1081
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:19,240
Well, she was a very strange girl.

1082
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,800
She had a lot of psychological problems.

1083
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,400
I'm not entirely sure, Inspector.

1084
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,080
A poor girl split too.

1085
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,820
She took a dislike to the course for some particular reason.

1086
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,560
I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

1087
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,260
And she asked for a refund.

1088
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:32,820
I declined.

1089
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,140
And she decided to spray her disapproval all over my car.

1090
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,020
A good thing to spray, isn't it?

1091
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:46,640
worship us well she was a very odd girl inspector maybe she
thought it was a way of getting back at us I had no idea did

1092
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:52,760
Rebecca know about it well yes she did but I was I wasn't
about to unleash Rebecca on her she can be quite fierce

1093
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:58,200
sometimes you know and I mean the girl wasn't vindictive she
had psychological problems she lives in the village actually

1094
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:05,640
oh the run-down house at the end of the lane can't miss it
we have a new person to ask literally oh no we have a person

1095
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:16,140
to ask everything about oh god lisa lives alone at the end
of the lane that's all for the moment thank you she sprayed

1096
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:27,840
her code all over his car spread my code this one this lane
could that be where lisa lives run down house at the end of

1097
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,480
the lane that's what ryan said wasn't it i seen i see a bush
unless it's this one

1098
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,040
New Challenger appears.

1099
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,880
Oh my god, we have to ask her about the bike.

1100
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,000
What if she knows something about the bike?

1101
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,620
What if, what if, what if?

1102
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:49,540
Hello?

1103
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:50,660
Is it Lisa?

1104
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:51,640
Yes.

1105
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,200
Inspector Jenks, I'm investigating an incident in the
village.

1106
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,660
I wonder if I could ask you a few questions.

1107
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,300
What sort of incident?

1108
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,620
I'd rather come in and discuss it if that's alright with
you.

1109
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,880
I promise I won't take long.

1110
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:06,180
I won't take long.

1111
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,060
I'll just be back like 50 times.

1112
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:15,060
I'll just go in here yes I have to go out in a minute oh oh
look I can come back later I might not be here what did you

1113
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:28,080
want to ask I just wanted to ask you did you know cave vine
no right well I heard that you're familiar with Atlas the

1114
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:35,500
life skills training company what do you want to know about
Atlas well you got Very interesting.

1115
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,900
Because I reacted badly.

1116
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,340
So would anyone.

1117
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,940
Now why do you say that?

1118
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,360
Because they're devil worshippers.

1119
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,080
Devil worshippers.

1120
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,680
They're making demons appear.

1121
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,540
They're tricking everybody.

1122
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,300
They're getting people to join up.

1123
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,360
Then they're putting demons inside them.

1124
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,000
You can see them.

1125
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:17,660
see who demons where could you see them in the mirrors i was
gonna say in the mirrors any mirror you can't get rid of

1126
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:32,440
them they stay inside you so how did you get rid of them i
didn't oh you still see them you got the demons in you

1127
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,980
I just don't look.

1128
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,500
I put all the lights on.

1129
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,240
I make sure it's all bright.

1130
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,960
I put them on when I need to look in the mirror.

1131
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,640
If I make sure everything is bright, I just see myself
without...

1132
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,620
Power outage.

1133
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:02,900
Seeing the other person.

1134
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:03,820
Other person?

1135
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,660
Who is the other person?

1136
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:12,440
She's like me, but older.

1137
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,840
It's like her eyes sink in.

1138
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,980
She's all wrinkled with a wrinkled mouth.

1139
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,560
Wrinkled mouth?

1140
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:25,840
Like she's dying.

1141
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:33,080
And then I realize I'm her.

1142
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:36,660
I'm not me anymore.

1143
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,500
What's happening?

1144
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,960
Drink some water.

1145
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,740
The door just opened by itself.

1146
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,680
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

1147
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:50,400
I'm sorry.

1148
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,160
I'm sorry.

1149
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,900
Drink some water.

1150
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:03,130
Just leaves this guy that she never knew just met just now
in her home.

1151
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:05,970
Well, that was curious.

1152
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,870
A very fragile and disturbed person.

1153
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:11,310
and utterly convinced that Atlas are worshipping the devil.

1154
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:14,310
How are Ryan and Paul going to get out of this one?

1155
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:18,590
How are they going to get out of this one?

1156
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:21,090
Great question.

1157
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,850
Did she try Simon's homebrew?

1158
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:25,350
No, she tried the...

1159
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,260
The magic mint.

1160
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,260
She tried the magic mint.

1161
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,160
Persona 6?

1162
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:41,380
Yeah, she tried the magic mint and maybe it messed up her
brain.

1163
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,820
Long time VOD watcher.

1164
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,900
Hope you have a great day.

1165
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,380
Yo, Jembo, thank you.

1166
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,980
You too, you too.

1167
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,780
Let's go to the Brandon house.

1168
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,780
Thanks for the super chat.

1169
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,420
A couple more questions, if that's okay.

1170
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,580
Lisa's accusation.

1171
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,980
Do you know anything about devil worship, Paul?

1172
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:13,580
I beg your pardon.

1173
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:15,120
Devil worship?

1174
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:16,660
Satanism?

1175
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,860
The devil?

1176
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:19,920
666.

1177
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:29,580
six i heard atlas had elements of satanism on the course you
are misinformed we're a training company we're not devil

1178
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:36,140
worshippers what kind of a question is that so you have no
interest in the occult no inspector i have no interest in

1179
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:43,600
the occult any more than i have interest in pool vaulting
cheese making or snake charming anything else you want to

1180
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,480
know that i'm not interested in that's fine thanks

1181
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:54,600
I have an interest in snake charming.

1182
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,780
Be back later on if that's okay.

1183
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,920
It's not okay, but I know you'll be back.

1184
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,620
He just can't stay away.

1185
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:04,980
Anytime.

1186
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,580
Anytime Jenks learns a new fact, he's got to tell everybody
in town.

1187
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,100
He's got to be like, hey, did you know about this?

1188
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,280
What do you think about this?

1189
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,760
What do you think when you see this?

1190
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,800
Do you know about this?

1191
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:34,000
knock knock i have one new question to ask of you has devil
worship ever been part of the course ryan ever am i correct

1192
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:41,720
in assuming that you have spoken to lisa blint you would be
she's been telling me all about the atlas obsession with

1193
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:47,760
satanism ryan then if you've met lisa blint then you will
have worked out for yourself that she has a very vivid

1194
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,480
imagination she also has Psychological problems.

1195
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,780
Diagnosed psychological problems as a matter of fact.

1196
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,140
What's wrong with cheese, Vixen?

1197
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,740
Where did she get the idea that you lot were devil
worshippers?

1198
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,480
I really have no idea.

1199
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,960
The girl is insane.

1200
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,580
Was it the Dalburner?

1201
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,640
She's frightened of her own shadow, bless her.

1202
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,320
She actually thinks that demons are possessing her even now.

1203
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,120
Oh, we know.

1204
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,980
You really can't trust a word she says.

1205
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:20,100
So you are saying there has never been any devil worship at
Atlas.

1206
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:26,160
even know what devil worship is inspector it's not something
i particularly know anything about i certainly don't recall

1207
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:33,240
anyone ever having worshipped the devil at atlas we even
tried to help the poor girl by paying for some treatment but

1208
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:41,260
she didn't want it really it's not easy to offer someone
help when they think that you're the problem that's a lie

1209
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:50,700
yeah doesn't know anything about devil worship oh come on
you said yourself that you used to read about black magic

1210
01:25:50,700 --> 01:26:02,440
and satanic rituals i know you so you used to read a lot
about voodoo and satanic rituals but you don't know anything

1211
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:09,920
about devil worship well obviously i just meant we don't
worship the devil we're not devil worshippers here at atlas

1212
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,420
inspector ridiculous but the point is ryan that you claim
not to know anything about it but admitted you were obsessed

1213
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:17,580
with it when you were younger.

1214
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,080
Are you sure none of that made its way onto the Atlas
course?

1215
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,560
And that Lisa isn't basing her beliefs on anything within
that course?

1216
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:30,940
Lisa isn't basing her beliefs on anything other than her own
imagination, Inspector.

1217
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:38,400
Look, we do use some techniques that some students find
difficult, disturbing.

1218
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,380
Disturbing?

1219
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,080
It's business!

1220
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:42,440
We encourage them to see things differently, that's all.

1221
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,200
And some people simply aren't up to that.

1222
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:50,240
Some people, like Lisa, That's why we introduced the
aptitude test.

1223
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,580
What's the aptitude test?

1224
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:53,020
This.

1225
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,700
Do you...

1226
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:59,040
How do you feel when you see these numbers?

1227
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,500
Six, six, six.

1228
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:04,000
We ask students to fill in an aptitude test.

1229
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,340
Medical history, psychological issues, that kind of thing.

1230
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,280
He put the test down!

1231
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,320
Any medication that they are using in the past, any
medication that they currently are using.

1232
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,500
Here, take a look.

1233
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:22,120
Basically, it's just to try and make sure that we don't get
another Lisa has it worked oh touch wood so far yes I keep a

1234
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:31,540
copy of this hmm I wonder how much importance they actually
give to this test and what are they doing that's so

1235
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:45,340
disturbing anyway where are they doing that's so disturbing
the aptitude test Alice do Alice do you some disturbing

1236
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,160
techniques.

1237
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:52,340
Incident prompted them to introduce an aptitude test.

1238
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:54,640
Huh.

1239
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,200
Alright.

1240
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:57,760
Thank you.

1241
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,220
Probably be back later.

1242
01:27:59,480 --> 01:27:59,800
Thank you.

1243
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,100
Bye-bye.

1244
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:04,060
Now I have to ask literally everyone in town about this.

1245
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,620
But before I do.

1246
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:07,480
Yep.

1247
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:07,960
Okay.

1248
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,500
Let's head to everybody's homes.

1249
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,060
I have a single question for you.

1250
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:19,360
I've learned something and I must ask you immediately before
I gather any other information.

1251
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,100
Have you ever heard about there being devil worship at
Atlas?

1252
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,320
Devil worship?

1253
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:27,680
No.

1254
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:29,540
Definitely not.

1255
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,160
Who said that?

1256
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,560
It's just something I heard.

1257
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,480
Okay, thanks.

1258
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,320
Okay, thanks.

1259
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,180
Yeah, we must ask the entire population.

1260
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,040
That's it for the time being.

1261
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:37,700
Thank you.

1262
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,400
Simon, tell me about this aptitude test.

1263
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,280
I know you took it.

1264
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,760
Did you do a test before you started at Atlas?

1265
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:53,280
yeah yeah um it was all just questions about okay if i had
any illnesses or mental health problems stuff like that you

1266
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:59,220
know but they didn't actually ask for any proof so i could
have lied through your teeth on that one don't think they

1267
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:15,860
actually checked interesting i have nothing wrong with my
brain and i definitely was not diagnosed with a parasite

1268
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:19,660
that controls my right arm.

1269
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,080
Thank you.

1270
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,700
Probably be back later.

1271
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:32,550
Nope.

1272
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:38,570
In fact, don't even check because you won't find anything.

1273
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:41,490
Don't even check.

1274
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:44,590
Revolver.

1275
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:49,990
I do not have a spirit in my brain.

1276
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:53,930
A few more questions.

1277
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:56,170
Guys, I have to go to the little ghosty's room soon.

1278
01:29:56,710 --> 01:29:58,010
Do you know anything about this?

1279
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,610
It's the aptitude test, isn't it, for Atlas?

1280
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:02,210
What do you want to know?

1281
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,150
Do you know why it was introduced?

1282
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:08,350
I think they had some trouble with some unsuitable students.

1283
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:11,330
I suppose you have to be careful who you work with.

1284
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,710
That's it.

1285
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:14,970
That's all.

1286
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:15,650
That's it.

1287
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,610
That's it.

1288
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:17,630
all for the moment.

1289
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:18,230
Thank you.

1290
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:19,190
Oh my goodness.

1291
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:29,970
I think this is my biggest, like, uh, my biggest complaint
about this game so far is I got one thing.

1292
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,830
Okay, time to ask.

1293
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:33,990
At least there's not a huge cast of characters.

1294
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:34,770
You know what I mean?

1295
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:36,950
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

1296
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:38,470
Can you ask them about Lisa?

1297
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:39,350
Oh, you're right.

1298
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:42,330
I don't think I've been asking them about Lisa's accusation.

1299
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,250
Ah!

1300
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:47,580
Forgetting!

1301
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:54,520
Can you tell me a bit about this please it's the Atlas
attitude but the story itself is really fascinating does it

1302
01:30:54,520 --> 01:31:03,560
test exactly it's a test to we introduced to make sure that
any students didn't have any major personality problems

1303
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:10,660
skeletons in the cupboard another lap around we introduced
it because we had a little bit of a problem with one of the

1304
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:21,220
students Lisa you are well informed and what do you think it
was that disturbed her?

1305
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,800
I believe that the course proved to be too demanding for
her.

1306
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:29,540
We discovered that she had one or two psychological
problems.

1307
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:30,440
One or two.

1308
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:36,400
And did you change anything else on the course apart from
introducing the test?

1309
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,720
We increased the entrance age to 21.

1310
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:44,900
That wasn't much but it's about the only thing we could do.

1311
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:50,420
We didn't want another Lisa, we didn't want students turning
around and suing us, did we?

1312
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:53,180
Yeah, I love Paul so much.

1313
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,560
He's so...

1314
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,520
Like, he is such a character.

1315
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:57,620
It's so awesome.

1316
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,520
Like, he's such a good character.

1317
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,300
Uh, raise the course entrance to 21.

1318
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,740
Why do I feel like that's not true?

1319
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:12,400
How old were you, Lisa?

1320
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,960
Oh, wait, but she had a drinking problem.

1321
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,140
Or, I mean, not Lisa, Kate.

1322
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,800
So, I guess she would be.

1323
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:22,820
Well, I mean, you don't have to be 21 to drink in The UK
though, no?

1324
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,520
Wasn't someone in the course 20?

1325
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:32,720
You have to be 18.

1326
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:38,240
But still, there's no contradiction here.

1327
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,670
I'm just going through real quick.

1328
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:17,860
later on if that's okay what age do you need to have a bike
so true all right let's we'll still go down to our good

1329
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:23,120
friend James can we go to this lady anymore no okay

1330
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:36,580
18 should be the legal age to buy consume should be 16 oh
okay a couple more questions if that's okay

1331
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:41,220
Lisa's accusation.

1332
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:45,940
Do you know anyone who is interested in or involved with
devil worship?

1333
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:47,500
Have you met Lisa?

1334
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,180
Which Lisa are you talking about?

1335
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,340
Mad Lisa lives on her own, doesn't like mirrors.

1336
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,160
Okay, that's a lot coming from you.

1337
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,260
You can't look at yourself in the mirror without seeing
ghosts.

1338
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,580
You've got problems, don't you think?

1339
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,060
How do you know her?

1340
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,160
She came to the farm for some eggs a couple of times.

1341
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,500
We're talking to her once, that's all.

1342
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,500
And what did she tell you?

1343
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:16,420
much except she thought the devil was after her what did you
tell her told her the devil needs a good reason to be after

1344
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:26,980
you oh she was just like most people really blind to herself
except she's more extreme that's all madness is being blind

1345
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:39,400
to yourself what I'm sure that helped James Lisa had visited
the farm a few times as Lisa thought the double I can't

1346
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:52,880
believe he called her mad Lisa like says you James wouldn't
know about the aptitude test are we okay that's it for now

1347
01:34:52,880 --> 01:35:05,620
oh my god so I thought I was coming to him for two questions
and in the end it really was only one punished Lisa now we

1348
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,620
have to go back to everybody else

1349
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:15,490
Don't worry, you'll be back.

1350
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:16,410
Oh, absolutely.

1351
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:18,550
Dingling.

1352
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:19,590
Dingling.

1353
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:22,030
Okay, the accusations.

1354
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:27,490
Have you ever come across anyone interested in or involved
with the occult?

1355
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:30,050
As in black magic.

1356
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:31,810
The occult, the occult, the occult.

1357
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:32,190
The occult.

1358
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:34,970
Atlas don't use occult techniques or anything like that.

1359
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:39,130
Atlas, not unless Ryan's got a secret he's not telling me
about.

1360
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:41,270
Why, he's been talking.

1361
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:55,050
just a line of inquiry okay thanks on the upside he said
more than nope that's so true Yakult Yakult my tummy has

1362
01:35:55,050 --> 01:36:04,290
been kind of bothering me lately so I wanted to get some
Yakult and then I didn't read and I accidentally got Calpico

1363
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:12,110
it was like the same bottle and everything I

1364
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:22,340
Thank you, probably be back later.

1365
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:23,760
What's the difference?

1366
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,840
I don't think the Calpico has like the...

1367
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:28,520
The...

1368
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,060
Lactus...

1369
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:29,960
Lact...

1370
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,600
KCI Sherot...

1371
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,040
Lactus Basilis...

1372
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,380
KCI Sherota...

1373
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,300
That...

1374
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,060
That...

1375
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:40,720
That Yakult...

1376
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,500
Has.

1377
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:44,080
Lactus...

1378
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:44,880
Lactus...

1379
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,700
Lactus...

1380
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,080
Lactus...

1381
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,160
KCI Sherota...

1382
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:57,660
probiotics no no Lactobacillus KCI Sheroda all

1383
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:12,880
yogurts have some probiotics it's all good but it does it's
not advertised as that I don't even know if Calpico is a is

1384
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:17,440
a yogurt drink actually not sure

1385
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,000
My Sharona!

1386
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:25,900
Emma.

1387
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,400
Emma.

1388
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:28,640
I'm coming through your window.

1389
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:33,320
Have you ever heard about there being devil worship at
Atlas?

1390
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:33,760
My game is glitching again.

1391
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:34,640
Devil worship?

1392
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,060
Oh, it's stuttering, it's stuttering.

1393
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:36,840
Definitely not.

1394
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,280
Who's that?

1395
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,860
It's just something I heard.

1396
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:39,780
Okay, thanks.

1397
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:41,300
Okay, thanks.

1398
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,920
Never heard of devil worship at Atlas.

1399
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:45,500
Thank you.

1400
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,700
Probably be back later.

1401
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,520
My Sharona?

1402
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,240
My Sharona!

1403
01:37:51,540 --> 01:38:04,680
about devil worship devil worship where at Atlas devil
worship at Atlas no there's none of that yes none of that

1404
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:15,590
that's all for the moment thank you okay call

1405
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:27,600
the chief for an update haven't asked Emma about the Atlas
episode thank you just a few more questions if you don't

1406
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,740
mind Gosh, you really started losing...

1407
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,640
Have you seen one of these before?

1408
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:41,040
Um, no, not this one exactly, but we had to fill something
similar in on the first night at Atlas.

1409
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:45,260
One of those aptitude tests, you know, fitness and stuff
like that.

1410
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,340
So it's different?

1411
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:52,210
Okay.

1412
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:54,770
Be back later on, if that's okay.

1413
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:57,150
Be back later!

1414
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,700
Okay, let's go to it.

1415
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,640
Talk to the chief.

1416
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,740
Wow, why'd they change it?

1417
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,360
Chief!

1418
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,420
Chief, I got mugged!

1419
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,640
That was like three hours ago.

1420
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,060
Make it interesting, Jank.

1421
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,680
Chief, I finally saw a bit of what goes on at Atlas.

1422
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,280
I walked in on a meeting.

1423
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,740
Very strange.

1424
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:31,300
There were several students sitting around a fire taking it
in turns to burn handmade woolen dolls.

1425
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,220
Emma was at Third Eye and Atlas, yeah.

1426
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:42,300
Ryan had an for it as did Simon he claimed it was all about
burning your past or something actually Simon told me

1427
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:50,740
something interesting he said they also use auto hypnosis on
the course oh what's that self hypnosis hypnotizing yourself

1428
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:59,700
apparently that may have been what disturbed Lisa so much is
it dangerous well not in theory nobody I've spoken to seems

1429
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:07,060
to think so well if it disturbs Lisa so much then it can't
be all that safe I suppose it depends on your state to begin

1430
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:16,100
with but i look into it okay keep it up jacks always do
chief always do oh very funny very funny bye-bye i love the

1431
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:28,060
chief i love the chief he's so funny all right there must be
a contradiction somewhere one

1432
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:46,720
second wait chief call number six press here seven times to
see a cheat

1433
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,440
Wait, what?!

1434
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,400
That's how you see the cheese!

1435
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:00,280
Wait, that's so funny!

1436
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,680
I guess because...

1437
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:04,620
Oh my...

1438
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:11,780
I'm just so curious about it.

1439
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,640
I'm just...

1440
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,240
I think it's so funny.

1441
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:22,480
Okay, so the auto hypnosis isn't dangerous and suggested
looking into it further.

1442
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,820
Oh gosh, I'm like thinking of all the people with the auto
hit.

1443
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:27,600
No, okay.

1444
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,480
Why are you guys saying six, seven?

1445
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:37,100
Oh, because it's clue six.

1446
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:38,780
Press seven.

1447
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:40,800
Oh my god.

1448
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,760
Wait, one?

1449
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:44,260
Oh!

1450
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:52,920
This is your first cheat.

1451
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:15,860
this is your first oh my god it added it to my cheats on
here it's so funny i know it's why is it in green okay paul

1452
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:20,680
claims it's impossible to be hurt or damaged in any way by
hypnosis but he also said lisa couldn't handle the

1453
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,160
techniques but didn't most of these techniques involve
hypnosis

1454
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:28,800
I'm thinking about that.

1455
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,120
I don't think I would have clocked that at all.

1456
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,000
I gotta lock in.

1457
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,180
I gotta lock in.

1458
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:38,440
This game was originally designed for the Amazon Fire Stick.

1459
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:39,900
That's why the controls are a little strange.

1460
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:40,620
What?

1461
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,760
That's crazy.

1462
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:43,920
Huh.

1463
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:46,860
At least I couldn't handle the course techniques.

1464
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:54,240
But impossible to be hurt or damaged.

1465
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,040
Uh-huh.

1466
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,060
me that.

1467
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,040
No one told me that.

1468
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:00,940
So nobody has ever been affected by auto-hypnosis.

1469
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,340
I was just curious what would happen.

1470
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:02,940
Except Lisa.

1471
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,120
Hypnosis wasn't the problem, Inspector.

1472
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:07,320
Lisa was the problem with Lisa.

1473
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,160
That's why we introduced the test.

1474
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,240
But the hypnosis was the trigger, wasn't it?

1475
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:15,680
Lisa arrived on the course believing we were all devil
worshippers.

1476
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,620
She was nuts to start with.

1477
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,060
We didn't make her like that.

1478
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:25,860
Well, as far as I can tell, Paul, you've had one student
accuse you of devil worship and two others commit suicide

1479
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:31,580
yeah some of your students aren't having a very good time on
this course are they nonsense Kate was enjoying every minute

1480
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:40,560
of it she couldn't get enough of it really she was full of
the joys of life bubbly confident flirty with whom you mean

1481
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:54,200
with whom with whom pretty much everybody including me as I
remember really and did you respond with students,

1482
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,620
inspector, company, policy.

1483
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,840
Oh, shut up.

1484
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,300
Shut up.

1485
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,520
Interesting admission that Kate flirted with him.

1486
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:05,160
There's no way Paul would have turned down an opportunity
like that.

1487
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,940
Wait, how do I...

1488
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:09,900
How do I call him out for not getting in...

1489
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,780
What's tried to date Emma?

1490
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,720
Avoids relationships with students.

1491
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:19,980
Excuse me?

1492
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,600
So you avoid relationships with students except for Emma,
who you tried to date.

1493
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:27,000
Oh, come on, Inspector, that was a long time ago.

1494
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:28,160
And what about Kate Vine?

1495
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,360
Did you try to date her or not?

1496
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,200
Oh, don't be so ridiculous, Inspector.

1497
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,460
Kate was an exceptionally clever girl.

1498
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,000
Clever girl.

1499
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,900
She knew exactly what she wanted, and she knew how to get
it.

1500
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:41,760
You mean that Kate approached you?

1501
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,200
It wouldn't surprise me if she was playing everyone in the
group.

1502
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:47,800
Kate had more enemies than you'd think.

1503
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:51,980
She was a very, very manipulative young woman.

1504
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:53,640
Oh!

1505
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,460
10, 10 p.m.

1506
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,480
10 o'clock, it's getting late.

1507
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:01,900
I'm gonna have to pick up the pace if I'm gonna solve this
by midnight.

1508
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,940
Arbitrary deadline of midnight for some reason.

1509
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,180
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

1510
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,240
Did we get anything new from that?

1511
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:12,660
No.

1512
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:13,460
Alright.

1513
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,020
I'm consulting the light bulb.

1514
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:17,760
Wonder who's in the pub.

1515
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,200
Okay.

1516
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:19,700
Oh.

1517
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:20,540
Oh.

1518
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:22,160
Oh.

1519
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:24,040
I really don't think it's my place, darling.

1520
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:25,180
They're in the restaurant!

1521
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,220
I just don't want to tell tales.

1522
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:31,920
Tell him about Scythe.

1523
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:34,580
You know what happens when you don't, as I say.

1524
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:34,940
Oh.

1525
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:36,500
Ah!

1526
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:41,660
So it's going to be that kind of evening, is it?

1527
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:42,920
If you play, you can't, right?

1528
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:45,180
Only if you deal.

1529
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,140
Problems.

1530
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:48,860
Hello, Inspector.

1531
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,620
See you later.

1532
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,500
You

1533
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:15,410
know, I thought it was that kind of relationship, and it
absolutely is.

1534
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:20,070
It absolutely is.

1535
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:37,040
I can't believe it.

1536
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,560
Um...

1537
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,880
Do I want to go to the restaurant?

1538
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:49,440
They left and, uh...

1539
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,540
I can't stop looking at the arm in the mirror.

1540
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:55,660
Watch it, watch it like...

1541
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:58,360
Flex a little bit and then disappear.

1542
01:46:59,360 --> 01:46:59,460
Shoo!

1543
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:06,100
I can't stop looking at it.

1544
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:06,600
What's...

1545
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:11,840
Did I get anything new?

1546
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:17,930
What did Ryan take from that cupboard?

1547
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:19,170
Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

1548
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:21,130
But how do I...

1549
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:22,410
Is he back at Atlas?

1550
01:47:22,570 --> 01:47:24,030
Like, how do I go find that?

1551
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:27,910
Is he behind the pub?

1552
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:30,130
Are you waiting back here?

1553
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,000
Maybe...

1554
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:40,820
Behind his home?

1555
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,040
It's so blue.

1556
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:54,720
It's soul blue Dabadi double die Looked like a Oh was there
a magnifying glass?

1557
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:59,830
Oh my gosh I didn't even see it, thank you guys Back to the
pub

1558
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:12,020
I was too distracted by the arm What is that?

1559
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:27,100
Pills here Whirlmorph liquid Well isn't that interesting
what is a rough cut white cube what kind of cube is it so

1560
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:34,120
what are they Rebecca's prescriptions prescriptions made out
to Rebecca were found in a cupboard in the pub this is

1561
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:43,040
starting to feel oh sugar that doesn't feel I mean I know
we're investigating but that feels like bordering legality

1562
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,080
so Rebecca what pills What do you take?

1563
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,120
What is your prescription?

1564
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,220
The cupboard downstairs.

1565
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:54,300
There's a lot of unopened stuff in it.

1566
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:54,760
Is that?

1567
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:58,020
Prescriptions made out to you.

1568
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:01,520
Oh, they're just spare painkillers.

1569
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,700
The chemist always gives us too many as a friend of the
family.

1570
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:06,920
Oh, that's not good either.

1571
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:11,340
He's giving you too much morphine?

1572
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:12,740
Is that what it is?

1573
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:16,600
But...

1574
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:21,500
Wasn't it like an or-or-o-morpho or something?

1575
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,860
That's not good.

1576
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:27,780
Thank you.

1577
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,260
Probably be back later.

1578
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:30,480
Uh-huh.

1579
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,820
Yeah, that doesn't sound legal at all.

1580
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:37,460
Alright, time to ask everybody about Rebecca's prescription
in town.

1581
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,060
Almost.

1582
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,340
It's literally morphine.

1583
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,560
What the hell?

1584
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:46,620
What's going on?

1585
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:56,930
is to go the bike oh oh wow hello simon he's the most
oblivious man on earth

1586
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:10,800

but at this stage i need all the clues i can get didn't

1587
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:21,310
kate have morphine in her system she did

1588
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:25,430
She did.

1589
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:29,650
Oh my god, you're right, I forgot that detail.

1590
01:50:30,650 --> 01:50:31,730
Drop the key ring.

1591
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:35,670
Send Bernard de Minson.

1592
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:38,390
Oh, look at the dog.

1593
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:46,650
Business tech was, business, business tech, sorry, Aztec.

1594
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:52,210
Sorry, that's how my brain works.

1595
01:50:52,830 --> 01:50:56,030
Business card was dropped by Simon on the way into his
house.

1596
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:57,770
Hmm.

1597
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,800
Uh, let's go inside.

1598
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:07,360
Simon?

1599
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:09,860
I'm knocking for Simon.

1600
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,340
A few more questions, please.

1601
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:13,940
Business tech.

1602
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,740
It's unlikely Simon.

1603
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,720
Yeah, it's unlikely anybody would know about that.

1604
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,060
I think you dropped this outside.

1605
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:22,220
Someone you know.

1606
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:25,720
Oh, this is just from some IT guy there.

1607
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:26,840
I don't need it.

1608
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:28,200
I had a code on the back.

1609
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,060
I noticed some numbers.

1610
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:37,600
the back do you need these i don't know what is it uh one
nine zero five oh yeah yeah that's just that's just a pin

1611
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:48,700
for something it's okay i can remember it so not an official
savings account no no it's uh it's not important suspicious

1612
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:53,280
suspicious wrote his pin on the back of the card

1613
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:09,660
what's this is this yours yeah that's from my keys where did
you find that just outside right oh it must have come off

1614
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:16,600
when Nathan dropped my keys off no uh he was borrowing my
car no it came up just now trusting yeah I suppose it is I

1615
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:23,080
am I bet too trusting really it's a new car as well no I
just can't why are you giving it back to him it's yours

1616
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:33,260
What about your...

1617
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:39,130
No.

1618
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:42,730
No.

1619
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:48,620
Aha.

1620
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,620
So the bike's the only way you can get to work, yes?

1621
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:53,180
Yeah.

1622
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:54,400
What's wrong with the car?

1623
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,260
No, I can't drive the car yet, can I?

1624
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:57,280
I don't have my license.

1625
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:58,040
Right.

1626
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:01,240
I got a windfall from an insurance payout.

1627
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:06,720
Just figured I'd buy something sensible with it straight
away instead of wasting the money.

1628
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:08,240
What was the insurance payout?

1629
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:13,860
are you gonna buy a depreciating car we got stolen down at
that you can't drive and also lend to others well they

1630
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:20,620
didn't break in i think they just a car that depreciates in
value the laptop was in a storeroom but i think the lock was

1631
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:27,260
broken that's what you think is taking their security very
seriously a better use of the money after that i think i'll

1632
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:37,280
check in anyway this has been a very nice laptop to be able
to buy a car with the insurance or a very cheap car Might

1633
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,980
have to have a talk with Ryan about his security measures.

1634
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:40,800
Wait, I missed that.

1635
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,500
Hold on.

1636
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:43,060
I missed that entire...

1637
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:45,940
Because I was so caught up on the...

1638
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:49,620
Wait, so he had a laptop stolen while attending a meeting at
Atlas?

1639
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,220
And he used that money to buy a car?

1640
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:59,100
Usually you can replay them, but this one is not allowing me
to.

1641
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:00,860
For some reason.

1642
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:05,460
Oh, maybe if I do the contradiction again.

1643
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:06,160
Oh, wait.

1644
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,780
No, actually, I don't think...

1645
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,500
I don't think it'll even let me.

1646
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:15,490
Where's the... Oh, wait.

1647
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:17,550
Oh, wait, never mind.

1648
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:21,330
Sorry.

1649
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:22,530
Oh!

1650
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:24,610
Wait, no, I'm gonna rewatch it.

1651
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:26,730
Laptop stolen from a storeroom.

1652
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:30,330
Owens a new car but doesn't have a license.

1653
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:31,750
Okay, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

1654
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:33,270
You can view it again from the menu.

1655
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:33,690
It's okay.

1656
01:54:35,370 --> 01:54:36,710
Sorry I was talking over it.

1657
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:37,910
That's it for the time being.

1658
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:38,310
Thank you.

1659
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:52,570
how we how i would like to see the car oh i forgot to talk

1661
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:10,950
one bit what do you know about this this what do you know
This is Simon's.

1662
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,530
I bought this from Rural Holiday.

1663
01:55:13,450 --> 01:55:14,450
Has he lost it?

1664
01:55:14,590 --> 01:55:15,410
Beloved Minto.

1665
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:16,390
I can't keep anything.

1666
01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:26,370
I hope this ends with Emma breaking up with Simon and moving
far, far away from this place.

1667
01:55:26,590 --> 01:55:27,890
It's clearly not good for her.

1668
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:32,730
Did you know about Simon's laptop being stolen?

1669
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:36,810
Yeah, because it had all my college work on it, which I
hadn't backed up or saved.

1670
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:49,900
Not that it mattered much, did buy a new one and Simon uses
it now when I let him yes Simon's laptop for college work

1671
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:54,760
bought a new laptop for them both why didn't he buy a new
laptop

1672
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:12,820
he decided to buy a car okay he bought a car he can't drive
instead of the laptop and then makes his girlfriend Buy a

1673
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:15,120
laptop for the both of them?

1674
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,880
I'm sorry, what?

1675
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:30,700
I guess I mean she did use the Simon's laptop for her
college work, but what?

1676
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:36,710
All Emma does is eat hot chip and lie.

1677
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,710
It's true!

1678
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:39,690
It's true!

1679
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:42,890
She eat hot chip and lie!

1680
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:48,370
All girls do.

1681
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:51,290
is eat hot chip and lie.

1682
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,210
What does that make me, though?

1683
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:55,410
I can't have spicy.

1684
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:01,910
Oh, well, I'm a ghost, so I don't know.

1685
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:02,910
Anyway, hold on.

1686
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:03,790
I will be...

1687
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:04,770

1688
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:09,670

1689
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:15,590

I'm gonna...

1696
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:21,380
That door's starting to hurt a little bit.

1697
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:24,540
Okay.

1698
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,440

Okay.

1708
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,180
Uh, what was the pin number?

1709
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:47,420
Call the chief.

1710
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:48,640
Things you haven't asked.

1711
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,700
James, Rebecca, Ryan, Paul.

1712
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:52,980
What was the pin?

1713
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,140
Let's go back to Simon.

1714
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:56,780
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

1715
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:57,600
And see.

1716
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,880

And then go to everybody else around the town and ask them
about all the things in the business card and the thing.

something from the cupboard too didn't see what it was

Look

1745
02:03:23,590 --> 02:03:27,690
at our progress percentage!

1746
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:34,320
That jumped up like crazy, though.

1747
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:35,860
We started at 30%.

1748
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:37,480
I'll just let you guys remember that.

1749
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:42,440
Anyway, resume.

Sorry, Mint, we gotta put you down.

1753
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,580
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

1754
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:52,060
It keeps happening to me, and I don't know why!

1755
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:56,820
Do you know who this is?

1756
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,840
Dean Hayfield, Aztec.

1757
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,740
Sorry, never heard of it.

1758
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,640

do about it ryan paid a con man to install a complicated

1765
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:55,780
cctv system at twice the price that it would probably have
cost seemed to do the trick though we haven't had a theft

1766
02:04:55,780 --> 02:05:07,100
since a con man not happy about the theft has installed cctv
system okay be back later on if that's okay be back later on

1767
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:20,700

1769
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:47,600

reason.

1773
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:25,430
Oh, it stopped flashing, but now I can still see it.

1774
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:30,460
That shouldn't even be on.

1775
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:32,180
Why is it showing that?

1776
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:39,640
Huh.

1777
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:44,880
Why do I always have computer problems?

1778
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:46,440
Is it because I'm haunted?

1779
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:48,520
Is it because of the EMFs?

1780
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:50,580
I'm using up the energies.

1781
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:58,490
A ghost in the AIO.

1782
02:07:02,110 --> 02:07:03,330
Call Aztec.

1783
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:04,670
I need help.

1784
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:06,150
I've seen this before.

1785
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:08,090
Don't think so.

1786
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:10,790
Okay.

1787
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:12,070
Never seen it.

1788
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:14,290
Unlikely James Manoa.

1789
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:15,550
Okay, that's it for now.

1790
02:07:15,710 --> 02:07:16,890
I thought they were friends-ish.

1791
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:23,830
The game's graphics are...

1792
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:36,390
too good obviously uh this is unity 10 sneak peek it's only
a little uncanny sorry for jinx's uh facial expressions you

useless to me to Atlas no okay the The screen went

1797
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,480
completely black now.

1798
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,120
What's wrong with my computer?

1799
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:37,820
Jank's facial animations are set to 200%, it's true!

1800
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:43,580
Ask you a couple more things, please.

1801
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:45,500
Yeah, I hope it's just the screen.

1802
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:46,320
I hope the...

1803
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:48,560
It's actually still cooling, you know.

1804
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,840
Do you know what the medicine in the cupboard at the pub is
for?

1805
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:58,060
You'd better ask Rebecca about that.

1806
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:00,240
I'm not exactly sure what's in there.

1807
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:03,040
She tends to keep her aware as under lock and key.

1808
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:06,440
Do you know our wedding night was quite a surprise.

1809
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:15,860
Also if she keeps herself under lock and key how was I able
to see it then?

1810
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:23,330
But also why would you tell me that?

1811
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:25,310
Know anything about this?

1812
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:26,450
What does that have to do with anything?

1813
02:09:26,670 --> 02:09:27,390
No I don't.

1814
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:27,790
I'm sorry.

1815
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:30,850
We have our own IT chap.

1816
02:09:31,390 --> 02:09:32,130
Lovely chap in fact.

1817
02:09:32,610 --> 02:09:33,130
Fat and sweaty.

1818
02:09:33,270 --> 02:09:49,850
it's like a double act doesn't it what does that mean what
does that mean what do you mean have you seen this before no

1819
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:58,350
sorry nobody has seen this before either what happened with
simon's laptop were you at atlas when simon's laptop was

1820
02:09:58,350 --> 02:10:01,950
stolen oh i believe i was yes he was taken from the
storeroom in the hallway.

1821
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:03,050
Was it ever recovered?

1822
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:04,310
No, we didn't catch anyone.

1823
02:10:04,650 --> 02:10:06,150
We're quite exposed out here.

1824
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:10,250
Somebody just wandered along the lane, seen into the
storeroom.

1825
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:11,530
It's not particularly secure.

1826
02:10:11,630 --> 02:10:13,230
They could have been in and out within minutes.

1827
02:10:15,490 --> 02:10:18,390
That's why we advise people to keep their valuables with
them.

1828
02:10:18,530 --> 02:10:20,650
You can't be too careful these days, Inspector.

1829
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:26,450
It was one of those risks that you guys, that you guys say
you should do.

1830
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:27,010
You know?

1831
02:10:28,110 --> 02:10:28,990
The risks.

1832
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:32,250
to steal from students.

1833
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:35,590
Maybe you can actually steal from students.

1834
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:37,390
The risks.

1835
02:10:38,570 --> 02:10:39,290
The risks.

1836
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:40,930
Yeah.

1837
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:42,730
The risks.

1838
02:10:44,010 --> 02:10:46,410
Advises students to keep valuables with them.

1839
02:10:55,110 --> 02:10:55,630
Thank you.

1840
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:56,830
Probably be back later.

1841
02:10:57,110 --> 02:10:58,010
Is there anyone I forgot?

1842
02:11:00,870 --> 02:11:01,950
The pin.

1843
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:04,790
The pin.

1844
02:11:07,710 --> 02:11:09,570
for the card

1845
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:24,310
click here to see oh wow look at that wait this is so handy
wait this is so handy put the pin on the back of the card we

1846
02:11:24,310 --> 02:11:29,590
misunderstood him he hasn't been on the same drink the whole
time he's got to be a few drinks in

1847
02:11:43,150 --> 02:11:47,530
wouldn't be that I don't know what the pen could be.

1848
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:53,470
I figured it would be for the laptop, but it wouldn't let me
press him on that.

1849
02:11:55,650 --> 02:11:56,530
And also...

1850
02:11:56,530 --> 02:11:58,790
Yeah, I haven't seen anything like a laptop.

1851
02:11:59,790 --> 02:12:02,430
And also, I can't flip the card.

1852
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:04,110
I think I'd have to go to... Okay.

1853
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:06,810
Let's think of a place where we saw four numbers.

1854
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:08,050
I don't know.

1855
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:10,090
I don't know.

1856
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:10,390
Wait.

1857
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:11,850
I don't know.

1858
02:12:12,010 --> 02:12:12,250
Wait.

1859
02:12:15,330 --> 02:12:16,710
Is it something in here?

1860
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:21,730
It did look like 1905, didn't it?

1861
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:25,330
Was it in the drawer?

1862
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:27,010
No.

1863
02:12:32,490 --> 02:12:36,590
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, where would the pen be used?

1864
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:56,480
Hmm.

1865
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:02,200
But there's another thing in the woods to use the pen on.

1866
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,100
Let's go!

1867
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:05,820
We'll try it!

1868
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:09,460
In the clearing, there's a mysterious safe.

1869
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:11,980
I was just dropped there.

1870
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:21,100
I'm just trying to think.

1871
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:23,320
I'm really trying to think.

1872
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:25,140
Oh, whoops.

1873
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:26,620
Uh.

1874
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:31,160
Gotta be an atlas.

1875
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:33,580
But we've looked at everything, though.

1876
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:38,740
I feel like we looked at everything.

1877
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:41,200
Okay, let's go back in.

1878
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:45,820
Into the atrium.

1879
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,400
Into the door on the right.

1880
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:56,380
I will go back into the...

1881
02:13:56,380 --> 02:13:56,840
Hold on.

1882
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:11,220
Are there any new magnifying glasses?

1883
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:12,860
None that I saw.

1884
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:14,020
But it's also...

1885
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:15,520
I wish it was like a different color.

1886
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:17,480
Because it's hard to see it.

1887
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:19,200
Uh...

1888
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:20,500
We'll try it here.

1889
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:24,660
No.

1890
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:25,240
No.

1891
02:14:45,170 --> 02:14:46,570
Maybe I need to talk to someone.

1892
02:14:46,670 --> 02:14:48,910
I think the game would tell us if we needed to.

1893
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:53,190
Can we use it at the phone?

1894
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:10,570
Check the farm in a while.

1895
02:15:11,610 --> 02:15:12,910
Yeah, we could try that.

1896
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:17,250
I'm really at a loss.

1897
02:15:19,310 --> 02:15:20,410
With this one.

1898
02:15:21,570 --> 02:15:23,210
The post office, we can't go in.

1899
02:15:24,050 --> 02:15:25,610
Like, it just won't let us go in.

1900
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:36,140
Didn't Jank say you should check out the Alice Warehouse
where the laptop got stolen from?

1901
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:38,900
Is there a way to get to it?

1902
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:40,540
The garage?

1903
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:45,800
We'll just check everything right now.

1904
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:56,320
You're stepping!

1905
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:58,380
Nope.

1906
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:18,580
Guys, I've already exhausted all options with Ryan and,
like, talking to people.

1907
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:24,320
Okay.

1908
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:31,340
Like if usually the little thing will tell me where to use
the or tell me what I'm missing the little light bulb and

1909
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:35,220
it's only telling me to do the the pin

1910
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:40,690
Even if there's a contradiction I feel like it would tell me

1911
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:55,850
No, there's no computer in Atlas

1912
02:17:03,470 --> 02:17:05,950
Just a few more questions if you don't mind

1913
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:16,180
Do you want to cheat?

1914
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:17,880
It...

1915
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:19,680
No, not quite yet.

1916
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:25,100
No, they're no combination locks.

1917
02:17:42,670 --> 02:17:44,570
I think you dropped this outside.

1918
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:45,750
Someone you know.

1919
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:49,270
Oh, this is just from some IT guy in there.

1920
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:50,550
I don't need it.

1921
02:17:50,750 --> 02:17:51,070
Enough.

1922
02:17:51,530 --> 02:17:52,950
I noticed some numbers on the back.

1923
02:17:53,050 --> 02:17:53,490
Do you need these?

1924
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:54,510
I don't know.

1925
02:17:54,930 --> 02:17:55,770
What is it?

1926
02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:57,690
One nine zero five?

1927
02:17:58,130 --> 02:17:58,910
Oh, yeah.

1928
02:17:59,090 --> 02:18:00,990
Yeah, that's just a pin.

1929
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:12,910
for something it's okay I can remember it so not an optional
savings account or anything no no it's it's not important

1930
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:21,950
1905 that's all for the moment thank you I'm

1931
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:39,160
at a loss I'm at a loss when

1932
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:59,150
I go to the phone booth it's like an automatic scene.

1933
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,890
I can't control anything in there.

1934
02:19:05,850 --> 02:19:07,470
It does seem like a combination lock.

1935
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:08,090
Yeah.

1936
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:16,920
The dad hated the IT guy, but the son liked him.

1937
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:17,780
Is that a contradiction?

1938
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:25,780
Basically the way contradictions work is you can only
contradict what the person said themselves.

1939
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:33,900
So if the dad says something, you can't use what he said
against what The sunset.

1940
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:39,240
I feel like it's the pin to the laptop.

1941
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:43,380
But we don't know where the laptop is to use it.

1942
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:45,980
Like, I'm just kind of like...

1943
02:19:46,660 --> 02:19:47,960
I don't know.

1944
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:51,500
And let me look in, like, their garage again or something.

1945
02:19:51,700 --> 02:19:52,260
The garage.

1946
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:05,000
Janks has already used the remote control lock here.

1947
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:06,060
Okay, just kidding.

1948
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:22,520
I would like a hint.

1949
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:23,860
If anybody...

1950
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:24,660
Nose.

1951
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:39,100
The pub?

1952
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:43,800
Go talk to Rebecca.

1953
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:48,660
Everybody's giving me conflicting answers.

1954
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:49,440
I have no idea.

1955
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:03,340
Ask about a few more things, please.

1956
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:34,520
Doesn't take any drugs or medicine.

1957
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:40,760
Rebecca's prescription painkillers.

1958
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:49,920
So, you don't take any medicines except for prescription
painkillers.

1959
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:52,600
Well, they're not actually for me, they're Ryan's.

1960
02:21:53,140 --> 02:21:55,520
For some reason, the chemist always makes them out to my
name.

1961
02:21:55,540 --> 02:21:56,080
That's weird.

1962
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:58,740
He's an old gentleman.

1963
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:01,620
Does Ryan need prescription painkillers?

1964
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:03,420
Yes, he's got arthritis.

1965
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:04,320
Really?

1966
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:06,340
He's young to suffer from that, isn't he?

1967
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,140
He doesn't have it badly.

1968
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:10,440
but he does need medication from time to time.

1969
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:11,400
What medicine is it?

1970
02:22:11,540 --> 02:22:12,840
I can tell you to be honest.

1971
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:13,580
Ryan will know.

1972
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:17,420
Ryan's the one using the prescriptions.

1973
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,900
I think I might have a word with him.

1974
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:22,620
Work out exactly what this medicine is.

1975
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:25,340
The cane is diabolical.

1976
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:26,380
What?

1977
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:30,460
Be back later on if that's okay.

1978
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:32,800
Oh my god.

1979
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,120
The game did trick us.

1980
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:45,640
okay I'll have to be a little bit more vigilant then oh I
forgot about her saying that to begin with that she doesn't

1981
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:49,820
take the okay a couple

1982
02:22:54,160 --> 02:23:04,620
more questions if that's okay yeah why you have arthritis
about your arthritis oh you found out about that well yes

1983
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:14,040
I'm old before my time that's very unlucky to have it so
young yeah well I take a lot from life, Inspector.

1984
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:17,060
And sometimes life likes to give you a little bit back.

1985
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:18,360
I mean, it's not too bad.

1986
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:19,500
It's not too debilitating.

1987
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,940
It's mainly, uh, some in my right hand, some in my left
hand.

1988
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:25,160
It's not particularly a problem.

1989
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:27,500
Uh, it makes it difficult to hold small things there.

1990
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:29,920
What do you take for it?

1991
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:31,860
I, uh, get a prescription painkiller.

1992
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:33,820
How often do you need that?

1993
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:34,640
Not often.

1994
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:35,780
As and when, as and when.

1995
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:37,000
I keep some here.

1996
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:38,020
I keep some at home.

1997
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:39,640
It's not a problem.

1998
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:45,720
You don't allow things at Atlas.

1999
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:51,220
You don't even allow anything.

2000
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:58,420
Doesn't keep many medicines on site due to insurance
restrictions.

2001
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:08,580
So, you don't keep any medicines on site at Atlas.

2002
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:09,060
No.

2003
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:12,300
Except your prescription painkillers.

2004
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:16,140
Well, these are not available to the students.

2005
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:17,500
But they are kept on site.

2006
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:19,120
Yes, but they're locked away.

2007
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:20,580
They're kept in the storeroom.

2008
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:22,200
Nobody would have access to them.

2009
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:23,220
You're sure about that?

2010
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:24,200
It makes it hard to hold things.

2011
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:24,740
Absolutely sure.

2012
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:27,820
What are the painkillers, Ryan?

2013
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:29,760
Well, they're painkillers.

2014
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:30,920
Just painkillers.

2015
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:32,160
Normal painkillers.

2016
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:32,940
Paracetamol.

2017
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:33,940
Codeine.

2018
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:35,700
Morphine.

2019
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:37,040
Well, all right.

2020
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:38,740
They're morphine tablets, yes.

2021
02:24:39,400 --> 02:24:40,440
Oh, really?

2022
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:42,400
Oh, come on, Inspector.

2023
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:46,380
I know what you're thinking, but there's no way Kate could
have had access to them.

2024
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:47,700
Because they're in the storeroom.

2025
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,520
Well, not just that.

2026
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:51,500
She wouldn't have even known about them, or where they were.

2027
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:52,820
Sure about that.

2028
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:53,720
Yes.

2029
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:58,060
So it is morphine Ryan's taking.

2030
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:00,420
The pieces are starting to come together.

2031
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,380
Starting to come together.

2032
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:03,520
Now I just have to work out how Kate got hold of it.

2033
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:06,620
If it was Ryan's morphine she got hold of, of course.

2034
02:25:10,060 --> 02:25:10,740
Thank you.

2035
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:12,400
Can we go to the store?

2036
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:14,600
Is that where the code is for, I wonder, maybe?

2037
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:18,880
Can we go to the storeroom?

2038
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:20,540
Can I go to the storeroom?

2039
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:22,760
Can you let me in the storeroom?

2040
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,460
Can I enter the storeroom?

2041
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:29,920
Is that the storeroom?

2042
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:34,580
This reaction was Suss AF.

2043
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:36,180
I know, I know.

2044
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:39,120
Light arthritis does not need morphine.

2045
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:41,480
Morphine is like crazy.

2046
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:48,470
Columbo?

2047
02:25:48,710 --> 02:25:49,670
No, minto.

2048
02:25:50,690 --> 02:25:52,290
One more thing.

2049
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:54,350
Yeah, wasn't the laptop stolen from the storeroom?

2050
02:25:54,810 --> 02:25:55,170
Exactly!

2051
02:25:55,330 --> 02:25:57,190
Let me end the storeroom, please!

2052
02:25:58,330 --> 02:25:59,550
Is it out here?

2053
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:02,530
Can I access it from here?

2054
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:04,550
I think I need to look into the storeroom.

2055
02:26:07,210 --> 02:26:07,650
No!

2056
02:26:08,930 --> 02:26:10,810
How do I find the storeroom?

2057
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:12,010
I'm looking again.

2058
02:26:13,130 --> 02:26:14,210
That's the chief.

2059
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:15,790
Things you have asked, okay.

2060
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:20,600
It's so invasive.

2061
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:22,420
Did you know that...

2062
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:22,900
That...

2063
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:25,800
That Ryan has arthritis?

2064
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:28,560
Like, why do they... Why do I need to ask them about that?

2065
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:31,720
It's kind of invasive, no?

2066
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,440
Let me in that storeroom.

2067
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:37,500
Let me in the storeroom.

2068
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,420
Everything is...

2069
02:26:38,420 --> 02:26:40,460
Everything... All the answers are in the storeroom!

2070
02:26:41,180 --> 02:26:41,940
Oh, I know it.

2071
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:43,260
A few more questions, please.

2072
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:46,020
Contradict him on the storeroom being secure.

2073
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:46,760
Yeah, I will.

2074
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:47,500
I'll go back.

2075
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:52,040
Did you know about Ryan Rand's arthritis?

2076
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:52,940
Arthritis?

2077
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:56,680
I didn't think Ryan had arthritis.

2078
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:00,680
I didn't know about Ryan's arthritis.

2079
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:01,700
That's it for the time being.

2080
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:02,320
Thank you.

2081
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:08,760
Did you know about Ryan's arthritis?

2082
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:09,340
Ryan?

2083
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:11,020
He's got arthritis.

2084
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:12,040
Apparently.

2085
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:13,440
No, I didn't know.

2086
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:15,020
I had no to see him any problems.

2087
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:19,220
He's got... he's got arthritis?

2088
02:27:20,140 --> 02:27:20,880
Oh my god.

2089
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:21,920
Oh my god.

2090
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:22,620
I guess it is.

2091
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:25,220
It is kind of shocking because he's so young.

2092
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:27,500
Just airing out his...

2093
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:28,840
Did you know that he has arthritis?

2094
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:30,900
Just thought I'd tell you.

2095
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:33,960
Oh, you didn't know?

2096
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:34,540
Okay.

2097
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:36,040
That's fine.

2098
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:37,740
You know, I just thought I'd mention it.

2099
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:39,920
Are we Jenks or Nancy Drew?

2100
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:44,780
How long?

2101
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:45,240
Oh, whoops.

2102
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:46,400
I meant to go to the front.

2103
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:56,920
how long do we have uh it's 10 p.m in the game and also in
for me and we have until midnight ask you a couple more

2104
02:27:56,920 --> 02:28:05,680
things please when did ryan begin to suffer from arthritis
ryan doesn't suffer from arthritis really the only thing

2105
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:14,660
that ryan suffers from is a pathetic inability to deal with
any kind of discomfort he pulled his back sometime last year

2106
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:20,500
since then he's going around telling everybody he suffers
from arthritis.

2107
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:23,360
I thought he had medication for it.

2108
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:23,900
For his back?

2109
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:31,260
Oh, he only has medication because his GP, who is almost as
dysfunctional as he is, keeps prescribing it for him.

2110
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:34,100
So you don't believe he really has arthritis?

2111
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,320
Not at all.

2112
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:41,500
Can you like get high on morphine?

2113
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:44,840
Can you get addicted to morphine?

2114
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:50,000
That's all for the moment.

2115
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:50,480
Thank you.

2116
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:51,260
Oh, you can.

2117
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:57,320
Oh, you can.

2118
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:01,480
Oh, super fast?

2119
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:02,860
Oh, my gosh.

2120
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:05,100
Oh, wait.

2121
02:29:05,220 --> 02:29:06,100
I think I meant to ask him.

2122
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:08,860
Or wait.

2123
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:09,520
Did I tell him?

2124
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:10,220
Okay, never mind.

2125
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:11,820
Yeah, he told us about the CCTV.

2126
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:16,820
That's why it's illegal if not prescribed.

2127
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:18,280
Oh.

2128
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:21,580
They call it the Ryan Epidemic.

2129
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:23,560
Ryan is...

2130
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:24,280
Is...

2131
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:25,500
That's...

2132
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:26,060
He's...

2133
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:29,540
What if he's, like, dealing morphine to people in the
village?

2134
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:42,920
Heroin is just refined morphine?

2135
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:44,380
I didn't know.

2136
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:45,920
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

2137
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:46,640
What?

2138
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:51,200
He wouldn't know about his arthritis.

2139
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:52,060
Oh, that's it for now.

2140
02:29:52,180 --> 02:29:53,800
At least we have the...

2141
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:56,020
The hindsight to think that.

2142
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:00,360
Opium, morphine, heroin, basically.

2143
02:30:01,380 --> 02:30:01,540
Oh.

2144
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:06,740
Not a Satanist, just a drug dealer.

2145
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:08,840
Now, how boring would that be?

2146
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:11,320
Come on, I hope that they're summoning devils.

2147
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:16,420
Please, please be summoning demons and the devils and
everything.

2148
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:18,620
Please don't be a drug dealer.

2149
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:20,740
That's so boring.

2150
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:25,480
Come on.

2151
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:30,800
What if when he disappears, it's because he has to cook?

2152
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:33,120
Well, I'm not going to ask.

2153
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:34,360
How do you make it?

2154
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:41,760
Because I was going to be like, what if the ritual is
somehow involving the morphine?

2155
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:49,220
They get the impressionable young college students to get
addicted to the morphine.

2156
02:30:51,100 --> 02:30:53,000
The true demon was addiction.

2157
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:55,960
It's becoming too real.

2158
02:30:57,540 --> 02:30:58,040
What did I forget?

2159
02:30:58,060 --> 02:30:58,860
Oh, let's go.

2160
02:30:58,980 --> 02:30:59,620
I press him.

2161
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:05,030
About the storage.

2162
02:31:07,630 --> 02:31:08,510
Into the atrium.

2163
02:31:12,790 --> 02:31:14,530
A couple more questions if that's okay.

2164
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:15,690
All right.

2165
02:31:17,330 --> 02:31:20,370
Keeps the morphine in a secure room, storeroom at Atlas.

2166
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:26,900
Storeroom isn't particularly secure.

2167
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:28,560
Aha.

2168
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:30,120
Aha.

2169
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:33,540
So the storeroom isn't particularly secure, yet you...

2170
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:35,560
keep your morphine tablets in there.

2171
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:42,000
I thought you said no one could get access to the morphine,
but they could quite easily, couldn't they, Ryan?

2172
02:31:42,320 --> 02:31:43,820
I didn't mean that store room.

2173
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:45,280
I meant a different store room.

2174
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:46,200
I kicked them in there.

2175
02:31:47,180 --> 02:31:49,220
Okay, so where was it locked up?

2176
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:50,160
It's upstairs.

2177
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:52,120
It's got a combination lock on it.

2178
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:54,780
Nobody could have access to it except me and dad.

2179
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:55,660
Nobody.

2180
02:31:56,120 --> 02:31:57,680
I might have a look at that if you don't mind.

2181
02:31:58,580 --> 02:31:59,360
Don't mind at all.

2182
02:32:03,560 --> 02:32:04,440
room, I see.

2183
02:32:04,820 --> 02:32:06,320
Well, I might have a look around for that.

2184
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:10,220
See how secure and combination locked it really is.

2185
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:14,580
A combination, you say?

2186
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:18,080
I kind of wish it... Oh, now we can finally go upstairs.

2187
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:18,700
How exciting!

2188
02:32:18,820 --> 02:32:19,340
A new area!

2189
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:23,540
I almost wish he was just like, 1905.

2190
02:32:24,860 --> 02:32:27,140
And Ryan be like, what do you mean by that?

2191
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:28,500
And he's like, 1905.

2192
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:29,780
I know your combination.

2193
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:32,280
Free morphine!

2194
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:37,040
Oh, he's running up them stairs look

2195
02:32:54,640 --> 02:33:02,980
how easy it was welcome to the mirror room this exercise is
all about identifying the difference between the image one

2196
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:12,840
presents to the world and one's real self which lies deep in
our unconscious as you move through the network of mirrors

2197
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:22,400
practice seeing yourself as a stranger the more you separate
from your persona the more aware you will become your true

2198
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:36,700
desires and ambitions chant with us i am free from my image
i am free from my past i am free from myself i am free from

2199
02:33:36,700 --> 02:33:50,500
my image i am free from my past i am free from myself i am
free from my image i am free from my past i am free from

2200
02:33:50,500 --> 02:34:00,460
myself i okay this exercise involves the use of liberation
masks you have now completed module one module two covers

2201
02:34:00,460 --> 02:34:10,520
boundary testing threshold testing and extreme testing
extreme testing carefully before attempting the module i

2202
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:12,180
wish to leave the mirror room

2203
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:18,900
I wish to leave the mirror room.

2204
02:34:26,370 --> 02:34:27,950
We are losing Minto.

2205
02:34:28,830 --> 02:34:29,550
I'm not Minto.

2206
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:30,630
I don't know who I am.

2207
02:34:30,770 --> 02:34:32,310
I freed myself from that persona.

2208
02:34:34,370 --> 02:34:35,750
I am now.

2209
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:38,520
Binto.

2210
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:40,200
My original character.

2211
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:42,840
A few more questions.

2212
02:34:43,060 --> 02:34:44,260
Yeah, where's the morphine in there?

2213
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:46,180
What the hell was that?

2214
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:55,920
Can you tell me what you know about the mirror what you know
about it oh you found that then hmm well it's very similar

2215
02:34:55,920 --> 02:35:03,600
to the costumes inspector it's designed to help the students
look at themselves differently and what do you do with the

2216
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:13,320
mirrors you look at yourself inspector you look at yourself
until you start seeing yourself as as others do and you

2217
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:22,160
don't see yourself as as you do anymore it really the idea
is that you can yourself eventually in any way you wish.

2218
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:24,340
This is such a mumbo-jumbo-jumbo.

2219
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:27,500
To make sure you're not distracted, that's all.

2220
02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:29,260
How often is it used?

2221
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:30,000
Not often.

2222
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:30,880
A few times a month.

2223
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,620
Some students find it useful.

2224
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:33,320
Sometimes.

2225
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:36,840
I see.

2226
02:35:39,300 --> 02:35:42,020
The room is locked so students aren't distracted.

2227
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:45,860
Like...

2228
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:49,120
Where is the mumbo-jumbo?

2229
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:53,420
Not because I want some.

2230
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:01,080
I have freed myself from chat.

2231
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:02,080
Oh, no!

2232
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:07,260
Hold on.

2233
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:10,920
Let's go back to the scrying mirror and see what he said
about that.

2234
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:17,600
Okay.

2235
02:36:30,930 --> 02:36:31,230
Okay.

2236
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:36,690
scry me a river let's

2237
02:36:51,590 --> 02:36:59,190
go ask some other people about the mirror room thank you
probably be back later I'm afraid of Rebecca's response I'm

2238
02:36:59,190 --> 02:37:13,570
afraid of what she has done in the mirror room with Ryan I
am afraid of it ask you a couple more things please what is

2239
02:37:13,570 --> 02:37:21,450
this do you know about the mirror room I'm gonna grab a bag
of chippy's yeah what's it useful well it's mainly for the

2240
02:37:21,450 --> 02:37:30,270
auto hypnosis module you go in and you stare into the mirror
and you go into a trance then when you're ready you come

2241
02:37:30,270 --> 02:37:38,070
back out so you just go in whenever you want to oh no
there's certain times when you're allowed in and only they

2242
02:37:38,070 --> 02:37:44,250
know the combinations anyway so you can't really get in but
you don't know the combination no you don't know the

2243
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:58,300
combination Yes.

2244
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:03,640
So you didn't know the combination to the locked mirror
room?

2245
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:04,260
No.

2246
02:38:07,240 --> 02:38:07,840
Except...

2247
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:09,400
You'd written it down, hadn't you?

2248
02:38:10,180 --> 02:38:14,320
This is the combination to the mirror room, Simon, that you
wrote.

2249
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:15,640
It isn't a pin.

2250
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:17,440
It's a combination.

2251
02:38:18,940 --> 02:38:19,220
Yeah.

2252
02:38:20,220 --> 02:38:24,240
You see, this sort of thing makes me suspicious, Simon.

2253
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:27,320
What were you doing in there that you didn't want to do?

2254
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:35,480
anyone including me to find out it's just part of the course
isn't it I just I just wanted to go in there when I was

2255
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:43,920
ready on your own you didn't give a number to anyone else no
Simon there was morphine kept in why was there more to play

2256
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:57,700
the part in Kate Vine's death did Kate have the number yes
okay we both went in together we were trying to our outdo

2257
02:38:57,700 --> 02:39:07,000
each other we we both try to morphine what do you mean
trying to outdo it's part of the course to see how far you

2258
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:16,000
can push yourself to see if you can do something you
wouldn't normally do like morphine a few months ago how

2259
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:27,740
often did you try it only that once I'd never do it again
right I don't know sorry I Oh!

2260
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:30,700
11 p.m.

2261
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:32,280
That's how Kate got the morphine.

2262
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:35,000
But what exactly does this testing involve?

2263
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:37,260
Could this have been what killed Kate?

2264
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:38,620
Uh-oh.

2265
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:40,780
Just an hour left to solve this thing.

2266
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:41,960
Uh-oh!

2267
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:44,400
Morphine contest!

2268
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:47,240
Pam freely, back on my own free will.

2269
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:47,620
Yay!

2270
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:48,880
Welcome back to Argo.

2271
02:39:49,060 --> 02:39:51,380
I definitely did not threaten you to come back at all.

2272
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:52,220
Hi, Minto!

2273
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:53,720
Hello, secret sir.

2274
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:55,100
Thank you for 11 months!

2275
02:39:57,340 --> 02:39:59,340
Oh man, wait, let's see.

2276
02:39:59,960 --> 02:40:00,920
81%!

2277
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:02,300
Oh my god!

2278
02:40:03,820 --> 02:40:06,640
Ooh, everything's picking up, everything's picking up.

2279
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:08,740
Into the pub.

2280
02:40:12,630 --> 02:40:13,410
Tell me, Rebecca.

2281
02:40:14,770 --> 02:40:15,210
Tell me.

2282
02:40:16,650 --> 02:40:17,850
What do you know?

2283
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:18,750
Just a few more questions, if you don't mind.

2284
02:40:18,770 --> 02:40:19,970
About the mirror room.

2285
02:40:20,730 --> 02:40:25,110
Do you know anything about a locked room at Atlas with
mirrors in it?

2286
02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:27,190
Not at the top of my head.

2287
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:28,850
No, I think that's a question for Ryan.

2288
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:32,290
I see.

2289
02:40:35,830 --> 02:40:36,790
I see.

2290
02:40:37,510 --> 02:40:38,070
Thank you.

2291
02:40:38,290 --> 02:40:39,530
Probably be back later.

2292
02:40:42,650 --> 02:40:42,990
Paul.

2293
02:40:44,950 --> 02:40:45,410
Your...

2294
02:40:45,810 --> 02:40:47,670
It's getting so dark.

2295
02:40:48,970 --> 02:40:52,250
Wait, it's so funny because it's 11pm?

2296
02:40:53,170 --> 02:40:54,190
But it's like...

2297
02:40:54,990 --> 02:40:56,310
So blue.

2298
02:40:59,450 --> 02:41:01,470
Ask about a few more things, please.

2299
02:41:03,410 --> 02:41:08,130
Can you tell me about the room with the mirrors at Atlas,
the one with the combination lock?

2300
02:41:08,270 --> 02:41:09,130
How did you get in there?

2301
02:41:09,310 --> 02:41:11,190
I was given the code for the combination.

2302
02:41:11,430 --> 02:41:11,970
By right?

2303
02:41:12,470 --> 02:41:16,030
Well, nobody else is allowed to know the code, are they?

2304
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:17,410
And not in theory.

2305
02:41:17,810 --> 02:41:19,670
So how is the room used on the course then?

2306
02:41:19,710 --> 02:41:26,210
It's a meditation room where the students can reflect on
themselves, literally.

2307
02:41:26,310 --> 02:41:27,810
And what about the CD?

2308
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:30,270
That helps too, it's part of the program.

2309
02:41:30,930 --> 02:41:35,430
So you send the students into the room, they put the CD on,
they stare into the mirrors.

2310
02:41:36,270 --> 02:41:37,570
And how long does this last for?

2311
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:41,470
Until the CD finishes or they fall asleep, what else would
you like to know?

2312
02:41:42,930 --> 02:41:43,730
Fall asleep!

2313
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:53,040
I mean, so neat room you got there, what's with all the
mirrors?

2314
02:41:53,480 --> 02:41:54,400
Why'd you lock the door?

2315
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:55,540
Wait!

2316
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,720
Now they fall asleep from the morphine!

2317
02:41:59,400 --> 02:41:59,800
Um...

2318
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:06,420
in theory

2319
02:42:17,660 --> 02:42:25,460
okay there has to be a contradiction somewhere I'm gonna see
if we can call the chief too real quick since it's now 11 p

2320
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:25,700
.m.

2321
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:31,420
chief I'm calling you late into the night oh what's
happening

2322
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:39,560
what is this Amazon delivery at 11 p.m.

2323
02:42:42,340 --> 02:42:43,300
I'm a bald man.

2324
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:46,820
Hmm.

2325
02:42:47,820 --> 02:42:48,260
Suspicious.

2326
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:49,560
Chief.

2327
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:52,600
Why is it so blue?

2328
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:53,780
Because it's dark out.

2329
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:56,840
It's nighttime.

2330
02:42:57,080 --> 02:42:58,860
This is what happens in the UK.

2331
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:10,520
Okay.

2332
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:11,180
Let's go.

2333
02:43:11,220 --> 02:43:12,240
Let's go talk to him.

2334
02:43:13,700 --> 02:43:16,000
Hey, what the, what, what'd you get there?

2335
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:18,280
What'd you get there?

2336
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:20,400
A couple more questions if that's okay.

2337
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:21,460
Oh, we're not going to ask.

2338
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:24,600
Wait, we're not going to ask about that?

2339
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:25,940
Okay.

2340
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:27,380
Be back later on, if that's okay.

2341
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:28,700
Maybe he put it up in the garden.

2342
02:43:36,140 --> 02:43:38,520
There's just a huge blue light.

2343
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:42,940
That they put over the sun.

2344
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:45,160
Like, oh my god, it's so blue.

2345
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:48,360
It's so blue.

2346
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:50,800
Dabadi, dabadar.

2347
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:53,640
Dabadi, dabadar.

2348
02:44:02,340 --> 02:44:02,940
Oh!

2349
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:07,760
What does that say?

2350
02:44:09,380 --> 02:44:10,140
What the heck was...

2351
02:44:10,140 --> 02:44:13,600
So James is interested in poppy pods, is he?

2352
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:13,940
Poppy pods.

2353
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:15,200
I think he's got some explaining to do.

2354
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:19,560
What the heck is a poppy pod?

2355
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:21,240
What?

2356
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:24,180
This box of dense it's...

2357
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:25,780
checkies from the side.

2358
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:29,400
What's a poppy pod?

2359
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:33,520
That's a poor opium!

2360
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:36,520
I don't... Oh my gosh, you guys are learning.

2361
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:40,000
I don't know anything about drugs at all.

2362
02:44:42,340 --> 02:44:42,720
I know.

2363
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:44,500
I would be the worst detective.

2364
02:44:45,820 --> 02:44:48,200
I'd be like, hmm, he's gardening.

2365
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:53,180
I don't know anything.

2366
02:44:54,620 --> 02:44:56,420
Do you want questions please?

2367
02:44:57,460 --> 02:44:59,180
What's the box of poppy pods?

2368
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:04,390
What can you tell me about several boxes of dried poppy pods
in the greenhouse back there?

2369
02:45:06,220 --> 02:45:07,480
Feel free to take some if you want.

2370
02:45:07,720 --> 02:45:08,980
What are they for, James?

2371
02:45:09,080 --> 02:45:09,900
What are they for, James?

2372
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:10,720
Decoration, right.

2373
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:11,520
Decoration.

2374
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:12,260
Decoration.

2375
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:15,520
It's a big market for them among the over 70s.

2376
02:45:15,820 --> 02:45:17,000
So what are you doing with them?

2377
02:45:17,460 --> 02:45:19,800
Selling them to grannies.

2378
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:22,100
Okay, James, let's just cut to the chase.

2379
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:24,180
Are you extracting opium from them?

2380
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:33,400
them me i can honestly say i've never done anything like
that inspector sure about that scouts on her and who was the

2381
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:40,760
guy delivering them a friend she only knows what she's like
someone gave them to him he asked me if i wanted them that i

2382
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:47,220
said i'd have a look i can tell you all about you just
thought you'd have a look no particular reason i'm a plant

2383
02:45:47,220 --> 02:45:56,020
scientist that's what i do have you ever sold them to anyone
else i only got them a few minutes ago in the past you know

2384
02:45:56,020 --> 02:46:04,100
kate's body had opium in the blood when it was found no no i
didn't hey hey that's nothing to do with me ah see yeah

2385
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:05,000
that's why we're questioning

2386
02:46:14,080 --> 02:46:22,160
never extracted anything from the pods we do know that he
was uh actually oh gosh i don't remember where it's at pods

2387
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:26,820
from a friend who didn't want them years.

2388
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:29,400
Poppy paws are used for decoration.

2389
02:46:29,620 --> 02:46:34,160
We already know that's a lie.

2390
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:35,920
Thank you.

2391
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:38,480
Ooh.

2392
02:46:39,860 --> 02:46:42,900
Dealing with opium is a classic British pastime.

2393
02:46:43,660 --> 02:46:44,260
The poppies.

2394
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:45,160
The poppies.

2395
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:48,440
Is that what they mean by poppy playtime?

2396
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:49,800
No.

2397
02:47:03,890 --> 02:47:05,610
Haven't searched the woods for a while.

2398
02:47:06,190 --> 02:47:07,650
Ha ha ha ha.

2399
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:22,090
okay but first we go inside ask you a couple more things
please what do you know about poppy pods poppy pods poppy

2400
02:47:22,090 --> 02:47:31,710
pods ever come across anyone selling them using them no no
yeah I guess we're gonna go look for where people are

2401
02:47:31,710 --> 02:47:39,310
growing thank you okay I'm sorry but it's very obviously
like a well used trail that's in the woods.

2402
02:47:40,010 --> 02:47:45,150
If I discover that someone is growing poppy pods, literally
off of the...

2403
02:47:45,790 --> 02:47:51,170
Literally off of, like, the path is going to be so stupid.

2404
02:47:52,070 --> 02:47:53,990
World's dumbest...

2405
02:47:53,990 --> 02:47:56,270
World's dumbest drug dealer ever.

2406
02:47:57,110 --> 02:47:57,990
Besides Walter White.

2407
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:01,390
Well, now, I'm sorry.

2408
02:48:01,510 --> 02:48:02,330
He was not a drug dealer.

2409
02:48:02,470 --> 02:48:03,230
He was a drug maker.

2410
02:48:05,050 --> 02:48:06,770
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

2411
02:48:07,750 --> 02:48:08,110
What?

2412
02:48:08,130 --> 02:48:10,070
What do you know about poppy pods?

2413
02:48:11,450 --> 02:48:11,930
Go on.

2414
02:48:12,030 --> 02:48:15,230
Have you ever come across anyone trying to sell them or
anything like that?

2415
02:48:15,810 --> 02:48:16,670
Maybe even in here.

2416
02:48:18,690 --> 02:48:19,930
And not that I remember.

2417
02:48:21,970 --> 02:48:23,450
She's so sexy.

2418
02:48:24,090 --> 02:48:24,410
Dang.

2419
02:48:26,030 --> 02:48:26,590
Thank you.

2420
02:48:26,750 --> 02:48:27,810
Probably be back later.

2421
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:32,510
We'll go to...

2422
02:48:32,510 --> 02:48:34,050
We'll ask everybody first and then we'll...

2423
02:48:34,050 --> 02:48:35,010
Oh my god, it's so dark.

2424
02:48:35,410 --> 02:48:36,570
And then we'll go to the woods.

2425
02:48:38,710 --> 02:48:39,570
Emma, it's 11 p.m.

2426
02:48:39,590 --> 02:48:41,030
and I'm knocking on your window.

2427
02:48:42,470 --> 02:48:45,090
I'm crawling through your window at 11 p.m.

2428
02:48:45,270 --> 02:48:46,810
It's so bright inside.

2429
02:48:47,110 --> 02:48:49,810
Have you ever known of anyone selling dried poppy pods?

2430
02:48:51,350 --> 02:48:51,810
Poppy pods?

2431
02:48:52,490 --> 02:48:55,170
Um, don't think so.

2432
02:48:55,250 --> 02:48:55,850
Isn't that opium?

2433
02:48:55,870 --> 02:48:57,050
Yeah, she's a great actress.

2434
02:48:57,350 --> 02:48:57,830
It's okay.

2435
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:03,320
Doesn't know anything about poppy pods.

2436
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:04,820
Ah, that's all for the moment.

2437
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:05,580
Thank you.

2438
02:49:06,780 --> 02:49:10,940
Isn't poppy what they laid in the...

2439
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:13,600
Field in Wizard of Oz?

2440
02:49:15,080 --> 02:49:15,420
Poppies?

2441
02:49:17,900 --> 02:49:19,720
Did you ask her about the mirrors?

2442
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:21,040
Oh, I don't think I did.

2443
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:22,540
Be back later on, if that's okay.

2444
02:49:23,380 --> 02:49:24,240
Oh, it is!

2445
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:25,460
Oh, poppy flowers.

2446
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:27,020
Oh, yeah, I forgot to ask.

2447
02:49:27,100 --> 02:49:27,300
Thank you.

2448
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:30,120
Do you know about the mirror room at Atlas?

2449
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:32,000
The mirror room.

2450
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:38,040
No, I heard about it, but I think it was only for the
students that were on the course.

2451
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:39,680
Something like that.

2452
02:49:43,270 --> 02:49:43,650
Okay.

2453
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:45,230
Okay, that's it for now.

2454
02:49:45,450 --> 02:49:45,990
Thank you.

2455
02:49:46,410 --> 02:49:47,270
Checks out, I think.

2456
02:49:48,150 --> 02:49:48,870
I remember what happened.

2457
02:49:48,990 --> 02:49:49,510
They fell asleep.

2458
02:49:50,030 --> 02:49:50,030
Yeah!

2459
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:51,810
You're right.

2460
02:49:52,010 --> 02:49:52,690
You're right.

2461
02:49:53,710 --> 02:50:01,090
Back then, was it known that, like, that, like, morphine was
a drug and had that kind of effect, I wonder.

2462
02:50:03,270 --> 02:50:04,090
Odd question.

2463
02:50:04,250 --> 02:50:08,830
Well, I mean, morphine has been around, but, like, you know
what I mean, like, it's like...

2464
02:50:08,830 --> 02:50:09,330
Poppy pods.

2465
02:50:10,050 --> 02:50:11,230
As in, for opium?

2466
02:50:12,730 --> 02:50:13,130
No.

2467
02:50:13,870 --> 02:50:22,710
though James didn't have opium tea once I think where did he
get it from I don't know I didn't ask James does his own

2468
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:30,870
thing what does opium tea taste like I don't know I didn't
try it really I didn't want to risk it did I I went to

2469
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:40,810
hospital once I had codeine and I went into anaphylactic
shock the doctors said it was um an opium derivative

2470
02:50:40,810 --> 02:50:46,950
apparently so whoa allergic to opiates

2471
02:50:53,670 --> 02:51:02,190
whoa didn't you make teas or whatever uh wait where does it
where does it say that

2472
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:12,380
oh makes it uh tried selling it but only sold to james Oh,

2473
02:51:21,330 --> 02:51:21,330
right.

2474
02:51:21,730 --> 02:51:23,690
He took the morphine in the...

2475
02:51:23,690 --> 02:51:25,850
Yeah, why would he lie to me about that?

2476
02:51:26,250 --> 02:51:28,470
Wait, you don't have an allergy at all, you liar?

2477
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:31,370
What the hell?

2478
02:51:33,250 --> 02:51:36,210
You and Kate took morphine in the mirror room.

2479
02:51:36,490 --> 02:51:37,670
That's what you said, isn't it?

2480
02:51:38,170 --> 02:51:38,430
Yep.

2481
02:51:38,830 --> 02:51:40,910
But you're allergic to opiates, Simon.

2482
02:51:41,590 --> 02:51:41,990
Opium.

2483
02:51:43,090 --> 02:51:44,930
You didn't take the morphine at all, did you?

2484
02:51:46,350 --> 02:51:46,950
Well, no.

2485
02:51:47,190 --> 02:51:47,810
No, I didn't.

2486
02:51:48,330 --> 02:51:53,350
Kate did though I thought you were trying to outdo each
other that was the point wasn't it what if you have an

2487
02:51:53,350 --> 02:52:06,310
allergy I mean we weren't trying to outdo each other as such
go on Ryan wanted me to test Kate to see how far she would

2488
02:52:06,310 --> 02:52:14,550
go to be prime candidate what candidate prime candidate it
means the best person in the group basically if they've been

2489
02:52:14,550 --> 02:52:20,490
caught saying like she's a very promising person's the
tester, it's me.

2490
02:52:21,050 --> 02:52:23,370
And the other person's the victim.

2491
02:52:24,190 --> 02:52:25,410
Well, it's not like that.

2492
02:52:25,910 --> 02:52:27,250
It's completely consensual.

2493
02:52:27,470 --> 02:52:29,270
It's just boundary testing.

2494
02:52:31,170 --> 02:52:32,650
Ryan wanted me to test Kate.

2495
02:52:32,970 --> 02:52:34,970
Because they thought she was the best student.

2496
02:52:35,550 --> 02:52:35,910
Well, maybe.

2497
02:52:36,070 --> 02:52:37,510
I don't know.

2498
02:52:38,710 --> 02:52:40,830
I just did what I was told, okay?

2499
02:52:40,970 --> 02:52:45,370
Except you decided to give her morphine to break the law.

2500
02:52:45,630 --> 02:52:47,310
I can't change that now, can I?

2501
02:52:48,410 --> 02:52:51,310
She didn't die of a morphine overdose, did she?

2502
02:52:51,770 --> 02:52:53,570
She died because she drowned.

2503
02:52:53,950 --> 02:52:56,970
But she drowned for reasons that aren't clear.

2504
02:52:56,990 --> 02:52:57,250
Oh!

2505
02:52:59,070 --> 02:53:01,730
Atlas seemed to have this all neatly worked out.

2506
02:53:02,410 --> 02:53:08,250
If Simon's telling the truth, Atlas are lighting the fuse
and then retiring to a safe distance, letting students test

2507
02:53:08,250 --> 02:53:12,470
themselves and push themselves to their limits while
avoiding all comeback.

2508
02:53:12,890 --> 02:53:14,450
Is this what happened to Kate?

2509
02:53:15,490 --> 02:53:16,110
How?

2510
02:53:22,120 --> 02:53:22,680
okay

2511
02:53:26,060 --> 02:53:33,520
uh thank you let's see if emma knows anything okay let's
just go back real quick the little crown is so cute do you

2512
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:41,360
know what a prime candidate is at atlas yes it's um what
every student wants to be it's the best student you get a

2513
02:53:41,360 --> 02:53:48,380
great high pay job afterwards what i don't think that really
happens though did you know anyone in the running to be

2514
02:53:48,380 --> 02:53:53,520
prime candidate leon like simon i don't think they picked
Simon, to be honest.

2515
02:53:54,620 --> 02:53:57,000
Well, he's got too many morals, and you can't help both at
Atlas.

2516
02:53:57,260 --> 02:53:57,500
Oh.

2517
02:53:58,820 --> 02:54:01,180
He also has an allergy to opium.

2518
02:54:02,300 --> 02:54:04,740
You can't have that at Atlas either, I guess.

2519
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:06,760
Oh, my gosh.

2520
02:54:09,260 --> 02:54:10,500
What the hell?

2521
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:15,540
Thank you.

2522
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:16,740
Probably be back later.

2523
02:54:20,720 --> 02:54:21,280
Wow.

2524
02:54:21,740 --> 02:54:22,100
Ooh.

2525
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:23,040
Oh,

2526
02:54:27,780 --> 02:54:31,020
gosh, we're going to ask lots of things about Prime
Candidates and such.

2527
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:35,220
I can't believe they're still letting me into their home at
11 p.m.

2528
02:54:35,240 --> 02:54:35,460
though.

2529
02:54:36,360 --> 02:54:37,440
Don't you guys sleep?

2530
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:40,300
Oh, it is Friday.

2531
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:43,460
A couple more questions, if that's okay.

2532
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:49,440
Know anything about Poppy Pods?

2533
02:54:49,680 --> 02:54:50,020
Poppy Pods?

2534
02:54:50,020 --> 02:54:51,600
Come across anyone selling them or anything?

2535
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:53,160
Poppy Pods.

2536
02:54:53,580 --> 02:54:58,720
or don't tell anyone, Inspector, but I hear that you can
make opium out of those.

2537
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:00,300
Is this just common knowledge?

2538
02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:00,900
It doesn't matter.

2539
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:11,060
Now, tell me what a prime candidate is.

2540
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:13,620
You're learning a lot, aren't you, Inspector?

2541
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:14,240
I think.

2542
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:19,280
Prime candidates are simply the best students, the ones with
the most potential.

2543
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:21,440
And what benefits do they get from that?

2544
02:55:21,900 --> 02:55:23,540
Well, they get the top job.

2545
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:24,900
Which is?

2546
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:27,520
Well, we have a deal with...

2547
02:55:27,540 --> 02:55:28,980
various multinationals.

2548
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:33,020
We train students to be exceptional, truly exceptional.

2549
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:34,580
Truly exceptional.

2550
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:37,120
And they get a wonderful top job.

2551
02:55:37,320 --> 02:55:39,160
It seems very simple deal.

2552
02:55:39,640 --> 02:55:42,340
And how do you decide who the prime candidate is?

2553
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:43,600
Have you test students?

2554
02:55:43,800 --> 02:55:43,940
No.

2555
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:45,780
Did you ever say...

2556
02:55:45,780 --> 02:55:47,540
I need to watch more shows like Breaking Bad.

2557
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:48,740
Do you test Kate, for instance?

2558
02:55:49,740 --> 02:55:51,820
Oh, you've actually been speaking to Simon, haven't you?

2559
02:55:51,860 --> 02:55:54,200
I really wouldn't trust anything that Simon Thompson says.

2560
02:55:54,260 --> 02:56:02,600
Do you know, he spent the best part of two months to
undermine Kate no no no no no no no Simon Thompson I really

2561
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:09,520
isn't my place to speculate but if you're looking for
motives inspector he certainly had a few motives I uh more

2562
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:18,460
than I what a motive to kill her do you mean now that's very
interesting inspector well that's up to you to decide what

2563
02:56:18,460 --> 02:56:26,720
other motive would it would you be implying whatever motive
would you be implying huh very very interesting that's all

2564
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:30,760
for the moment thank Very, very interesting.

2565
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:34,920
Let's go to the woods.

2566
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:36,960
I want to see what's happening in the woods.

2567
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:38,480
Into the woods.

2568
02:56:39,400 --> 02:56:40,100
Into the woods.

2569
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:44,820
They're turning on each other.

2570
02:56:45,320 --> 02:56:45,400
Yeah.

2571
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:48,940
Into the woods.

2572
02:56:50,520 --> 02:56:51,220
The clearing.

2573
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:52,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2574
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,620
Am I going to get mugged again?

2575
02:56:55,620 --> 02:56:56,860
Just keep pushing.

2576
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:08,100
just keep pushing keep pushing keep pushing you can push it
all the way in tom if you want to

2577
02:57:12,100 --> 02:57:21,280
excellent tom excuse me someone care to tell me exactly

2579
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:41,700
what what does it look like it's a threshold test a pain
threshold test i thought uh you were supposed to be good at

2580
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:52,500
working things out inspector jenks how do you know my name
and so this would be for atlas would it kyle kyle you

2581
02:57:52,500 --> 02:57:57,120
disappear now it's not a good idea to talk to a police
inspector like that.

2582
02:57:57,220 --> 02:57:58,020
Do you want to make you?

2583
02:57:58,100 --> 02:57:59,280
It's okay, Tom.

2584
02:58:00,460 --> 02:58:02,840
Mr. Jenks won't be bothering us anymore.

2585
02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:05,460
Don't make any rush commitments.

2586
02:58:05,580 --> 02:58:06,920
Just push it in.

2587
02:58:08,220 --> 02:58:09,540
Push it in.

2588
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:10,840
Kyle.

2589
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:13,480
I love the day for night.

2590
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:16,340
It's so glaringly bad.

2591
02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:19,280
Oops, somebody dropped their keys.

2592
02:58:19,620 --> 02:58:20,140
Well, well.

2593
02:58:21,060 --> 02:58:23,700
You really should take more care of your things, Ryan.

2594
02:58:25,080 --> 02:58:30,300
is your keys Kyle no

2595
02:58:36,470 --> 02:58:45,310
so that's threshold testing is it sticking a skewer through
your hand I could just ask Ryan or Paul directly about this

2596
02:58:45,310 --> 02:58:54,730
but I think I'll bide my time see what I can do with this
key fob first we have another car key fob interesting

2597
02:58:54,730 --> 02:59:08,390
interesting I once heard that If you are about to, like,
take a drug test for a job, you should not have a poppy

2598
02:59:08,390 --> 02:59:09,010
seeds.

2599
02:59:09,990 --> 02:59:14,650
It's making so much sense to me now because it can influence
your test.

2600
02:59:15,410 --> 02:59:17,970
Oh my god, I once heard that!

2601
02:59:22,190 --> 02:59:24,750
It's making so much sense to me now.

2602
02:59:24,950 --> 02:59:27,050
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

2603
02:59:27,650 --> 02:59:30,690
Because if you have just some, like, on a bun or something.

2604
02:59:30,930 --> 02:59:32,930
They'll be like...

2605
02:59:36,670 --> 02:59:38,030
Brain explosion!

2606
02:59:38,530 --> 02:59:38,550
Yeah!

2607
02:59:40,250 --> 02:59:42,570
That's why everything bagels are banned in Korea.

2608
02:59:43,430 --> 02:59:44,290
Is that true?

2609
02:59:46,570 --> 02:59:47,010
What?

2610
02:59:48,490 --> 02:59:50,570
Poppy seed bagels could give a positive.

2611
02:59:51,350 --> 02:59:52,270
Oh my gosh!

2612
02:59:52,990 --> 02:59:54,230
Oh my gosh!

2613
02:59:57,290 --> 02:59:57,570
Wait!

2614
02:59:58,270 --> 02:59:59,890
But I like poppy...

2615
02:59:59,890 --> 03:00:00,630
Am I...

2616
03:00:00,630 --> 03:00:01,930
Am I getting high?

2617
03:00:23,330 --> 03:00:26,210
I eat everything beggles.

2618
03:00:29,090 --> 03:00:30,850
No, I'm going to go to jail.

2619
03:00:33,030 --> 03:00:34,470
She's the prime candidate.

2620
03:00:34,910 --> 03:00:36,170
At least I don't have an allergy.

2621
03:00:40,110 --> 03:00:41,110
I'm an addict.

2622
03:00:46,220 --> 03:00:46,900
Everything beggles.

2623
03:00:54,940 --> 03:00:57,140
Maybe don't admit this on.

2624
03:00:57,160 --> 03:01:08,260
tree oh my god they just sell this in stores i ate this as a
child i don't know actually i don't

2625
03:01:12,130 --> 03:01:15,050
now i've been dead for a while

2626
03:01:23,140 --> 03:01:35,800
you're just high on afterlife my ocean is addicted to bagels
that's my opium no Wait, uh, buh buh buh buh, buh.

2627
03:01:36,740 --> 03:01:38,280
We grab the car key fob.

2628
03:01:41,320 --> 03:01:43,140
To their house.

2629
03:01:44,820 --> 03:01:46,260
To behind their house.

2630
03:01:47,460 --> 03:01:49,560
To stealing their car.

2631
03:01:51,700 --> 03:01:52,760
Peep, peep.

2632
03:01:58,300 --> 03:01:59,420
That's right.

2633
03:01:59,660 --> 03:02:00,780
That's right.

2634
03:02:01,640 --> 03:02:03,020
Good old Morphe and Mint.

2635
03:02:05,360 --> 03:02:06,920
She also eats poppy seeds.

2636
03:02:07,060 --> 03:02:08,100
She's a member of Yakult.

2637
03:02:08,760 --> 03:02:09,640
The whole cannibal thing.

2638
03:02:09,820 --> 03:02:10,300
What next?

2639
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:13,140
Summoning demons!

2640
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:15,700
Time out.

2641
03:02:15,880 --> 03:02:17,760
Oh, she admitted she was helping him.

2642
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:21,160
Don't distill the bagels.

2643
03:02:21,500 --> 03:02:22,060
Bingo.

2644
03:02:22,700 --> 03:02:25,000
What have you been up to?

2645
03:02:25,300 --> 03:02:28,080
Be very interesting to see how he explains this one.

2646
03:02:32,150 --> 03:02:41,130
I also encourage everyone to join the Yakult Yakult, Yakult,
Kult Beware of dog I'm sorry, wait a second That's a

2647
03:02:41,130 --> 03:02:43,470
contradiction They don't have a dog

2648
03:02:46,570 --> 03:03:17,040
500 pounds for Kate Are dead victim Why was there a 500
pound K for Kate the Yap cult I'm going straight there baby

2649
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:29,740
straight there more questions please yeah oh excuse me would
you like to explain what this is please Ryan 500 pounds

2650
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:37,020
intended for Kate it fell out of your car I assume that's
your car on the driveway at brandon house i suppose so so

2651
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:46,160
why were you going to give kate 500 pounds ryan it was just
a little incentive that's all just a little incentive not

2652
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:54,960
very little ryan 500 pounds she was uh a very good student
we we heard that she was leaving we wanted to give her

2653
03:03:54,960 --> 03:04:03,000
something but you didn't well obviously not are you sure
there wasn't any other reason you might want to give her

2654
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:11,080
this personal reason no well I'd like to keep hold of this
for a little while if you don't mind well don't consider it

2655
03:04:11,080 --> 03:04:28,450
a bribe will you inspector money meant as a little incentive
oh yeah okay hmm heard Kate wanted to leave Atlas no

2656
03:04:28,450 --> 03:04:30,530
ulterior reason for giving Kate the money

2657
03:04:42,880 --> 03:04:48,060
Do we have any like blackmail?

2658
03:04:49,820 --> 03:04:53,000
Anything that would be like, oh yeah, see ya.

2659
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:18,670
I wonder if it was like Kate was gonna talk about Emma.

2660
03:05:21,310 --> 03:05:24,590
You know, like let that get out.

2661
03:05:25,850 --> 03:05:29,250
Maybe Kate was bribing him, not bribing, blackmailing him.

2662
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:30,410
Later on, if that's okay.

2663
03:05:30,570 --> 03:05:31,290
I mean, that would make sense.

2664
03:05:31,450 --> 03:05:34,250
Not him blackmailing Kate.

2665
03:05:34,810 --> 03:05:36,830
Because if you're blackmailing her, why would you give her
money?

2666
03:05:37,190 --> 03:05:37,410
You know?

2667
03:05:45,440 --> 03:05:46,700
That's why they fought.

2668
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:48,420
What was it that they fought about?

2669
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:49,800
It was that, wasn't it?

2670
03:05:51,460 --> 03:05:53,440
Uh, but, but, but, but, but, okay, it's argument.

2671
03:05:57,010 --> 03:05:57,750
I had an affair with Ryan.

2672
03:05:57,870 --> 03:05:59,890
Kate wanted to blackmail Ryan over her affair.

2673
03:06:00,390 --> 03:06:00,750
Yeah!

2674
03:06:04,390 --> 03:06:05,710
Um, excuse me.

2675
03:06:06,690 --> 03:06:08,590
Ask you a couple more things, please.

2676
03:06:08,710 --> 03:06:09,550
Um, excuse me.

2677
03:06:10,090 --> 03:06:12,110
I don't actually know if we can use that, though.

2678
03:06:12,390 --> 03:06:12,850
Let me see.

2679
03:06:13,110 --> 03:06:14,210
Um, the argument.

2680
03:06:17,130 --> 03:06:20,410
Yeah, we can't use that because that was what Emma's
response was.

2681
03:06:20,450 --> 03:06:21,150
Probably be back later.

2682
03:06:22,510 --> 03:06:22,930
Okay.

2683
03:06:23,410 --> 03:06:23,910
Hmm.

2684
03:06:25,830 --> 03:06:26,290
Hmm.

2685
03:06:27,470 --> 03:06:27,710
Hmm.

2686
03:06:30,770 --> 03:06:33,030
There was definitely something about no incentives.

2687
03:06:34,270 --> 03:06:34,890
Was there?

2688
03:06:45,640 --> 03:06:59,560
students aren't tested which we will definitely we will
definitely get that contradicted later

2689
03:07:08,140 --> 03:07:19,120
oh okay trying to see if maybe there is something about no
incentives okay

2690
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:28,300
whatever it's too difficult looking through it.

2691
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:29,940
Just a few more questions, if you don't mind.

2692
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:32,140
Why is there no entry for that pain threshold test?

2693
03:07:33,020 --> 03:07:35,180
Jank said that he was going to hold on to it for later.

2694
03:07:35,340 --> 03:07:37,500
He didn't want to...

2695
03:07:37,500 --> 03:07:41,340
He didn't want to use it just right yet.

2696
03:07:41,660 --> 03:07:41,760
Wait.

2697
03:07:42,260 --> 03:07:43,020
Actually, go back to science.

2698
03:07:43,020 --> 03:07:43,180
Thank you.

2699
03:07:43,360 --> 03:07:44,360
Probably be back later.

2700
03:07:44,720 --> 03:07:45,980
Probably be back later.

2701
03:07:49,320 --> 03:07:49,920
Oh, yeah.

2702
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:51,240
Simon told Jank's about pranking.

2703
03:07:51,360 --> 03:07:51,580
Okay.

2704
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:53,160
Okay.

2705
03:07:53,260 --> 03:07:54,240
That's all for the moment.

2706
03:07:54,380 --> 03:07:54,700
Thank you.

2707
03:07:57,140 --> 03:08:01,140
We're getting so far off track, I'm answering why Simon
didn't lock his bike.

2708
03:08:01,640 --> 03:08:04,160
I can't believe his bike came back at some point though.

2709
03:08:06,280 --> 03:08:06,700
Emma wouldn't...

2710
03:08:06,700 --> 03:08:08,100
Be back later on if that's okay.

2711
03:08:10,100 --> 03:08:10,800
All right.

2712
03:08:15,470 --> 03:08:17,130
85% done, guys.

2713
03:08:17,330 --> 03:08:17,970
We're so close.

2714
03:08:19,910 --> 03:08:20,890
We're so close!

2715
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:30,430
Did you ask Ryan about Prime Canada?

2716
03:08:30,610 --> 03:08:30,790
Yeah.

2717
03:08:31,170 --> 03:08:31,490
We did.

2718
03:08:36,220 --> 03:08:42,140
Yeah, see, about, not, about, this was when he was just
like, you shouldn't trust Simon.

2719
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:45,760
Simon is this and that, and Simon was trying to undermine
Kate.

2720
03:08:46,040 --> 03:08:47,280
Ask about a few more things, please.

2721
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:52,720
The prime candidates.

2722
03:08:52,840 --> 03:08:55,360
Do you know what a prime candidate is?

2723
03:08:55,620 --> 03:08:56,240
At Atlas.

2724
03:08:57,980 --> 03:08:59,200
It's the best student.

2725
03:08:59,520 --> 03:09:00,320
And what does that mean?

2726
03:09:00,980 --> 03:09:04,100
It means they get a guaranteed job with a very good salary.

2727
03:09:04,340 --> 03:09:05,900
Well, that's the idea anyway.

2728
03:09:07,200 --> 03:09:22,560
but mostly they aren't up to it what happens then to get
sacked oh you just can't be in the club they get fired best

2729
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:29,900
not to ask rebecca about the money for kate okay that's it
for now thank you that's crazy you just get kicked out

2730
03:09:34,680 --> 03:09:35,920
That's so stupid.

2731
03:09:37,560 --> 03:09:38,740
This cult sucks, man.

2732
03:09:38,880 --> 03:09:39,180
I know.

2733
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:42,040
Oh, I keep going to the back, sorry.

2734
03:09:49,140 --> 03:09:51,380
A couple more questions, if that's okay.

2735
03:09:55,380 --> 03:09:57,660
What are prime candidates?

2736
03:09:58,520 --> 03:09:59,460
The best of the bunch.

2737
03:10:00,240 --> 03:10:00,800
The peaches.

2738
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:01,700
Peaches.

2739
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:02,280
Peaches.

2740
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:04,940
And so what does it mean to be a prime candidate?

2741
03:10:05,320 --> 03:10:11,140
We have a special relationship with many major international
companies.

2742
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:15,240
We provide them with our best students.

2743
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:19,060
And they get an instant job.

2744
03:10:19,780 --> 03:10:21,240
And what do you get out of it?

2745
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:23,600
Well, it's a little kickback.

2746
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:26,980
It's just business, Inspector.

2747
03:10:29,100 --> 03:10:29,500
Business.

2748
03:10:32,480 --> 03:10:33,100
Business.

2749
03:10:35,320 --> 03:10:51,580
his kickback payment now why do you think ryan might want to
give kate a check for 500 pounds i really no idea where did

2750
03:10:51,580 --> 03:11:01,880
you find it just outside you better ask him you think ryan
was interested romantically in kate i know he has a weakness

2751
03:11:01,880 --> 03:11:03,900
for blondes but i didn't think it

2752
03:11:07,280 --> 03:11:08,800
Nah, just outside.

2753
03:11:09,100 --> 03:11:13,660
Yeah, it was just, it flew directly in the wind, from the
wind into my hand.

2754
03:11:13,880 --> 03:11:14,160
Thank you.

2755
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:15,360
Probably be back later.

2756
03:11:20,460 --> 03:11:21,980
Blonde, but his wife is a Brunette.

2757
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,660
And so, so is Emma.

2758
03:11:28,880 --> 03:11:30,060
I don't think he's in the blonde.

2759
03:11:34,960 --> 03:11:35,920
Wait, also...

2760
03:11:39,220 --> 03:11:48,850
net wait a second it's does that wait did he

2761
03:11:56,360 --> 03:12:07,960
can we not contradict that hold on we'll go back in a second
questions please we'll come back in a second for that um

2762
03:12:07,960 --> 03:12:11,560
that's very curious okay thank you probably be back later

2763
03:12:17,320 --> 03:12:20,840
I can't tell if it's a script error or not, to be honest.

2764
03:12:21,400 --> 03:12:25,800
That's what I'm wondering, if it's that or...

2765
03:12:26,480 --> 03:12:29,460
I'll ask you a couple more things, please.

2766
03:12:29,620 --> 03:12:31,760
I was interested in blondes.

2767
03:12:37,950 --> 03:12:39,710
Only met Kate if you...

2768
03:12:42,230 --> 03:12:43,510
I don't know.

2769
03:12:43,910 --> 03:12:45,330
How do you contradict this?

2770
03:12:48,710 --> 03:12:50,330
Maybe he was making a joke.

2771
03:12:51,670 --> 03:12:53,310
A script error in a mystery game.

2772
03:12:53,670 --> 03:12:54,710
Right, that's why I'm like...

2773
03:12:58,020 --> 03:13:00,280
Try it with Met with her.

2774
03:13:05,710 --> 03:13:06,070
No.

2775
03:13:06,590 --> 03:13:08,230
Only Met Kate a few times.

2776
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:24,440
Like, I feel like if he's thinking of somebody else...

2777
03:13:25,940 --> 03:13:27,500
Paul, are you colorblind?

2778
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:31,460
From where I'm from, blonde can mean woman.

2779
03:13:32,980 --> 03:13:35,680
Maybe that's why it's in like the quotes like this.

2780
03:13:39,080 --> 03:13:42,180
Blondes is like a term for females.

2781
03:13:50,190 --> 03:13:50,590
I wonder.

2782
03:13:51,050 --> 03:13:52,350
Women is my type.

2783
03:13:55,190 --> 03:13:56,130
Never heard of that.

2784
03:13:57,330 --> 03:13:58,050
I wonder.

2785
03:13:58,450 --> 03:13:58,850
I don't know.

2786
03:13:59,490 --> 03:14:00,410
I did both of these.

2787
03:14:00,490 --> 03:14:01,790
Only met her and spoke to her.

2788
03:14:02,010 --> 03:14:02,870
Neither of them worked.

2789
03:14:08,790 --> 03:14:09,970
I don't know.

2790
03:14:25,720 --> 03:14:31,680
honestly we don't have like anything else that i could
really use with kate involvement that's all for the moment

2791
03:14:31,680 --> 03:14:40,420
thank you baoba welcome to bamboo ship thank you i already
tried to saw her at a meeting it didn't work it didn't work

2792
03:14:40,420 --> 03:14:46,660
um i'm gonna call the chief and see if he has anything to
say

2793
03:14:50,880 --> 03:15:00,340
yeah i wish i could just use the id itself and like hello
hello very much so sir an interesting discovery in ryan's

2794
03:15:00,340 --> 03:15:09,100
car a check for 500 pounds from ryan made out to kate he
said it was an incentive apparently he'd heard she was

2795
03:15:09,100 --> 03:15:18,960
thinking about i was writing the ralph student i suppose uh
doesn't add up 500 pounds is a lot more than an incentive

2796
03:15:18,960 --> 03:15:24,040
checks you can buy questions in parliament for that kind of
money sounds pretty desperate.

2797
03:15:24,860 --> 03:15:26,560
Keep on a Ryan about it.

2798
03:15:26,740 --> 03:15:26,740
Yeah.

2799
03:15:26,860 --> 03:15:29,080
Oh, and play yourself another drink.

2800
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:29,540
Another drink.

2801
03:15:29,680 --> 03:15:30,100
Thanks, Chief.

2802
03:15:30,240 --> 03:15:30,840
Thanks, Chief.

2803
03:15:32,040 --> 03:15:32,860
I'm having one.

2804
03:15:32,940 --> 03:15:33,180
Bye.

2805
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:35,720
I'm having one.

2806
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:36,060
Bye.

2807
03:15:46,560 --> 03:15:47,620
What the heck?

2808
03:15:49,320 --> 03:15:51,440
So we gotta go talk about the check more.

2809
03:15:53,480 --> 03:15:54,820
There must be a contradiction.

2810
03:15:55,620 --> 03:15:57,080
Alright, well, let me... I'm checking this.

2811
03:15:57,720 --> 03:15:59,120
You should call the Chief for an update.

2812
03:15:59,220 --> 03:15:59,540
I did.

2813
03:15:59,560 --> 03:16:01,000
Okay, cool.

2814
03:16:02,260 --> 03:16:06,740
A few more questions if you don't mind.

2815
03:16:07,100 --> 03:16:08,440
Okay, let's check my...

2816
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:10,020
No ulterior reason.

2817
03:16:20,190 --> 03:16:24,870
We have to find something maybe about the affair.

2818
03:16:26,710 --> 03:16:27,010
You know?

2819
03:16:28,290 --> 03:16:29,770
Anything about the affair?

2820
03:16:34,450 --> 03:16:36,210
Did we ever press him on that?

2821
03:16:36,310 --> 03:16:37,390
I don't even know if we did.

2822
03:16:40,810 --> 03:16:42,070
Enjoyed the course.

2823
03:16:45,410 --> 03:16:46,470
Oh, that's true.

2824
03:16:46,910 --> 03:16:48,190
Heard Kate wanted to leave.

2825
03:16:49,110 --> 03:16:50,710
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2826
03:16:54,890 --> 03:16:55,410
No.

2827
03:16:56,370 --> 03:16:56,710
Hmm.

2828
03:17:05,050 --> 03:17:06,290
What about the friend's hair color?

2829
03:17:07,370 --> 03:17:08,830
Oh, she's brunette, too.

2830
03:17:10,410 --> 03:17:11,710
Emma, Emma is also brunette.

2831
03:17:13,670 --> 03:17:15,090
I don't think we've...

2832
03:17:16,030 --> 03:17:18,790
Ever asked or ever brought that up?

2833
03:17:21,230 --> 03:17:22,750
Rhyme candidates?

2834
03:17:31,400 --> 03:17:32,160
Hmm.

2835
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:41,260
Hmm.

2836
03:17:46,200 --> 03:17:46,940
I don't know.

2837
03:17:47,660 --> 03:17:48,260
Try this.

2838
03:17:48,940 --> 03:17:49,200
No.

2839
03:18:13,990 --> 03:18:16,710
The only blonde is Emma's boyfriend.

2840
03:18:16,950 --> 03:18:17,330
Right!

2841
03:18:17,550 --> 03:18:17,930
Simon!

2842
03:18:18,190 --> 03:18:18,850
He's the blonde.

2843
03:18:18,990 --> 03:18:19,270
Wait.

2844
03:18:21,190 --> 03:18:24,310
He's interested in blondes.

2845
03:18:26,610 --> 03:18:28,650
Oh my god, it all makes sense!

2846
03:18:28,810 --> 03:18:29,790
It all makes sense!

2847
03:18:30,090 --> 03:18:30,730
The sass!

2848
03:18:31,810 --> 03:18:32,990
Oh my god!

2849
03:18:35,970 --> 03:18:42,550
Getting rid of Kate so that he could have Simon be the...

2850
03:18:43,450 --> 03:18:45,650
the prime student!

2851
03:18:46,110 --> 03:18:47,490
The cross-dressing!

2852
03:18:55,070 --> 03:18:57,170
Oh my god.

2853
03:18:58,550 --> 03:19:01,230
I'm kind of stuck here though

2854
03:19:17,700 --> 03:19:21,340
Not giving student bribes Did he say that though?

2855
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:25,760
I thought I can't find it if he said that

2856
03:19:36,900 --> 03:19:39,980
Chief said get a drink Maybe that was a clue to go to the
bar Maybe

2857
03:19:48,740 --> 03:19:53,420
Contradiction of morphine being in the safe But Students
access to the safe room.

2858
03:19:54,120 --> 03:19:56,940
I think we've touched on that, but I could try.

2859
03:19:59,840 --> 03:20:00,720
Um, here...

2860
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
Oh wait, um...

2861
03:20:09,450 --> 03:20:12,030
I don't think so, because it is a combination locked room.

2862
03:20:12,170 --> 03:20:12,710
I think it's okay.

2863
03:20:15,630 --> 03:20:16,510
Auto hypnosis?

2864
03:20:18,970 --> 03:20:20,190
There's so many things.

2865
03:20:20,450 --> 03:20:20,790
My gosh.

2866
03:20:21,050 --> 03:20:21,230
Ah!

2867
03:20:21,450 --> 03:20:22,990
Students are coerced or bribed!

2868
03:20:23,090 --> 03:20:23,510
There it is!

2869
03:20:23,570 --> 03:20:23,950
There it is!

2870
03:20:23,990 --> 03:20:24,470
There it is!

2871
03:20:25,050 --> 03:20:25,290
There it is!

2872
03:20:25,690 --> 03:20:26,170
Thank you.

2873
03:20:26,190 --> 03:20:35,010
got money meant for his little incentive we'll try that one
instead okay oh my goodness thank you there

2874
03:20:38,100 --> 03:20:51,840
we go huh good job thank you guys so students aren't coerced
or bribed in any way except Kate I'm not sure what you mean

2875
03:20:51,840 --> 03:20:59,440
you said you were going to give Kate the 500 pounds as an
incentive that's coercion isn't I really don't think you

2876
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:01,420
could call it coercion, Inspector.

2877
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:02,380
What would you call it then?

2878
03:21:02,380 --> 03:21:03,100
It was an incentive.

2879
03:21:03,300 --> 03:21:04,540
That's all a little encouragement.

2880
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:07,860
So how often do you use incentives?

2881
03:21:08,380 --> 03:21:10,400
Okay, incentive is probably the wrong word.

2882
03:21:10,540 --> 03:21:12,340
The money was just to see how Kate would respond.

2883
03:21:12,460 --> 03:21:13,480
It was part of her assessment.

2884
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:14,260
Oh my God.

2885
03:21:14,740 --> 03:21:15,560
Everything's part of the assessment.

2886
03:21:15,560 --> 03:21:16,880
We have to assess students as they progress.

2887
03:21:17,240 --> 03:21:20,820
We don't use conventional methods like sitting an exam or
anything like that.

2888
03:21:21,560 --> 03:21:23,900
People pay for this course per session.

2889
03:21:24,020 --> 03:21:25,840
We have to know if they're committed or not.

2890
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:28,120
So you're assessing their progress?

2891
03:21:28,380 --> 03:21:37,780
and testing their commitment yes we are we have to this is a
business not a charity commitment to the cult this is so

2892
03:21:37,780 --> 03:21:43,860
ryan's claiming the money was part of kate's assessment and
did this assessment also involve threshold testing i wonder

2893
03:21:43,860 --> 03:21:52,640
or was the money for something else wait where did that put
the okay here we go students pay per course per session give

2894
03:21:52,640 --> 03:21:55,120
kate the money to test test assess her

2895
03:22:02,250 --> 03:22:14,810
uh wait a second didn't he say though um students aren't
tested you said that yeah they don't test any yeah yeah yeah

2896
03:22:14,810 --> 03:22:24,010
well which one is it ryan do you test students or not well
some of them yes including kate yes why was she being tested

2897
03:22:24,010 --> 03:22:33,010
she was being tested because because we wanted to see if she
was good enough to become prime candidate okay so Kate was

2898
03:22:33,010 --> 03:22:41,470
in the running to be prime candidate yes and did you ask
Simon to test her yes I did but I didn't ask him to do

2899
03:22:41,470 --> 03:22:49,570
anything stupid he knew it was against course rules how far
did you ask him to push her I didn't ask him to push her I

2900
03:22:49,570 --> 03:22:57,830
asked him to test her there's a huge difference if Simon
decided to give her too much caffeine or morphine or

2901
03:22:57,830 --> 03:23:03,630
whatever that's his So if he did anything wrong, it was his
own responsibility.

2902
03:23:04,390 --> 03:23:06,610
He did it with his own mind and his own hand.

2903
03:23:06,870 --> 03:23:07,830
Oh, my God.

2904
03:23:08,050 --> 03:23:10,050
We had nothing to do with it.

2905
03:23:13,930 --> 03:23:14,850
It's midnight.

2906
03:23:16,510 --> 03:23:16,730
Midnight.

2907
03:23:17,230 --> 03:23:20,450
And still no suspect, unless you count everyone I've
interviewed.

2908
03:23:20,870 --> 03:23:24,890
It's no surprise that Ryan wants to avoid any suggestion of
being responsible for Kate's death.

2909
03:23:25,290 --> 03:23:28,430
But I wonder if the man protests just a little too much.

2910
03:23:29,610 --> 03:23:29,930
Yeah.

2911
03:23:29,950 --> 03:23:31,450
Oh, I think so, too.

2912
03:23:31,590 --> 03:23:32,870
Oh, 93%.

2913
03:23:32,870 --> 03:23:33,470
Alright, nice.

2914
03:23:33,610 --> 03:23:35,830
Okay, we will be able to beat this game today, guys.

2915
03:23:35,990 --> 03:23:36,550
I think so.

2916
03:23:37,190 --> 03:23:38,330
That was awesome.

2917
03:23:38,650 --> 03:23:40,950
That was like a true Phoenix Ride meltdown.

2918
03:23:41,070 --> 03:23:42,030
It was so good.

2919
03:23:42,670 --> 03:23:43,270
Alright, let me see.

2920
03:23:43,370 --> 03:23:45,090
Wonder what Paul thinks about prime candidates.

2921
03:23:45,450 --> 03:23:46,610
Also, some things you haven't asked.

2922
03:23:46,890 --> 03:23:47,530
What did I get?

2923
03:23:48,050 --> 03:23:49,070
Oh, Kate's prime status.

2924
03:23:49,170 --> 03:23:49,410
There we go.

2925
03:23:52,370 --> 03:23:54,290
I will get myself a drink in the pub.

2926
03:23:58,920 --> 03:24:01,580
We didn't tell him about Simon giving morphine to Kate.

2927
03:24:01,600 --> 03:24:01,980
Did we?

2928
03:24:06,580 --> 03:24:07,940
I don't think so.

2929
03:24:10,480 --> 03:24:11,600
That's a good point.

2930
03:24:14,500 --> 03:24:18,580
Yeah, because Simon told us that they would go, that they
went to the mirror room and did that.

2931
03:24:20,520 --> 03:24:22,920
And also, yeah, that's a good point.

2932
03:24:30,410 --> 03:24:32,950
A few more questions, if you don't mind.

2933
03:24:33,310 --> 03:24:33,590
Huh.

2934
03:24:35,150 --> 03:24:38,050
Did you know Kate Vine was a prime candidate?

2935
03:24:38,810 --> 03:24:39,130
No.

2936
03:24:41,490 --> 03:24:42,250
No.

2937
03:24:43,590 --> 03:24:44,350
No.

2938
03:24:51,230 --> 03:24:53,790
Be back later on if that's okay.

2939
03:24:54,310 --> 03:24:54,450
No.

2940
03:24:59,720 --> 03:25:01,720
Let's go ask Paul.

2941
03:25:04,120 --> 03:25:05,520
Couple more questions if that's okay.

2942
03:25:05,940 --> 03:25:08,440
Simple no after riots crash out is amazing.

2943
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:10,860
Oh, there we go.

2944
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:13,400
Was Kate a prime candidate?

2945
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:24,440
Well, as Ryan is probably already told you yes she was did
you ask simon to test her yes it's company policy leaders

2946
03:25:24,440 --> 03:25:32,880
don't get involved and it covers your back of course and
nobody knows the students better than they do inspector it's

2947
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:39,480
much better to let them just work it out among themselves it
isn't very professional to force students to test each other

2948
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:46,500
to the point where one of them gets killed paul we don't
force students to do anything that they don't want to do

2949
03:25:46,500 --> 03:25:54,280
inspector so you don't them into being tested no we don't
encourage anybody to hurt or offend anybody else here you

2950
03:25:54,280 --> 03:26:00,200
don't use threshold testing for instance no if simon
thompson went too far with kate that's his responsibility

2951
03:26:00,200 --> 03:26:09,380
not ours he's the one you should i think it's time to bring
out our wild card i don't trust him myself students not

2952
03:26:09,380 --> 03:26:14,500
encouraged to hurt each other don't use threshold testing
okay well we'll come back to that i suppose

2953
03:26:18,400 --> 03:26:19,200
clock, the T?

2954
03:26:20,440 --> 03:26:20,440
Yeah!

2955
03:26:21,900 --> 03:26:22,380
Yeah!

2956
03:26:22,920 --> 03:26:25,740
I feel like there's something here still, though.

2957
03:26:26,500 --> 03:26:27,320
Kate was being tested.

2958
03:26:27,500 --> 03:26:28,680
Leaders don't get involved.

2959
03:26:32,480 --> 03:26:33,900
Like, I feel like there's something.

2960
03:27:13,320 --> 03:27:15,980
The threshold testing, we don't have the thing for it.

2961
03:27:16,880 --> 03:27:18,060
I'm seeing if there's anything.

2962
03:27:19,980 --> 03:27:21,860
But it's like a...

2963
03:27:23,640 --> 03:27:32,560
Anything about, like, we don't test or we don't, you know,
we don't, uh, pressure and things like that, you know what I

2964
03:27:32,560 --> 03:27:33,200
mean?

2965
03:27:34,820 --> 03:27:36,340
That's what I'm going through.

2966
03:27:50,720 --> 03:27:57,060
I wonder if it's Atlas doesn't use scrying on the course.

2967
03:27:58,680 --> 03:27:59,380
But then there's a mirror.

2968
03:27:59,460 --> 03:27:59,760
Oh, you know what?

2969
03:27:59,780 --> 03:28:00,500
I'm just gonna try it.

2970
03:28:03,820 --> 03:28:05,720
Oh, oh, why did it disappear?

2971
03:28:10,630 --> 03:28:12,790
No, okay.

2972
03:28:18,170 --> 03:28:20,270
Scrolling, scrolling through everything.

2973
03:28:26,540 --> 03:28:27,140
Okay.

2974
03:28:29,620 --> 03:28:37,660
Okay, we'll have to come back for the threshold testing once
we're able to use that as a... I feel like that was our...

2975
03:28:37,660 --> 03:28:38,680
that was our uh...

2976
03:28:40,300 --> 03:28:42,040
The CD mentioned threshold.

2977
03:28:42,160 --> 03:28:42,940
We don't have that anymore.

2978
03:28:42,960 --> 03:29:01,160
it got taken from us or not the CD maybe in the mirror oh
the CD ah oh my gosh thank you I forgot about you say you

2979
03:29:01,160 --> 03:29:08,960
don't endorse threshold testing that's the phrase isn't it
yes except you do Paul because you told me that the students

2980
03:29:08,960 --> 03:29:17,320
use that CD in the mirror room I've listened to that CD and
it very clearly mentions threshold testing you keep batting

2981
03:29:17,320 --> 03:29:24,920
this away Paul we don't really use hypnosis the students
aren't really tested but I am this close to launching a

2982
03:29:24,920 --> 03:29:31,840
full-scale investigation look we get a kickback from these
students and they have to be exceptional of course we have

2983
03:29:31,840 --> 03:29:37,100
to test them that doesn't mean we do anything illegal what
do you think we do bump off the ones we don't like well that

2984
03:29:37,100 --> 03:29:41,120
depends on how far you push them doesn't Well, we certainly
don't kill them.

2985
03:29:41,440 --> 03:29:43,100
Nobody here wanted Kate dead.

2986
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:44,760
I'm sure they didn't.

2987
03:29:45,140 --> 03:29:49,100
But what do you expect, Paul, when you put students under
that much pressure?

2988
03:29:49,260 --> 03:29:50,920
She was a very, very valuable student.

2989
03:29:51,100 --> 03:29:52,420
She was worth a lot to the business.

2990
03:29:52,860 --> 03:29:52,860
Really?

2991
03:29:53,340 --> 03:29:54,360
And how much would that be?

2992
03:29:54,500 --> 03:29:56,560
Well, if you really want to know, 50 grand.

2993
03:29:56,880 --> 03:29:57,240
What?

2994
03:29:58,300 --> 03:30:00,060
She was worth 50 grand.

2995
03:30:00,200 --> 03:30:00,520
What?

2996
03:30:00,640 --> 03:30:00,880
Yes.

2997
03:30:01,180 --> 03:30:01,560
Why did she have a price?

2998
03:30:01,580 --> 03:30:02,540
What, you were selling her?

2999
03:30:02,740 --> 03:30:04,000
Of course we were selling her.

3000
03:30:04,200 --> 03:30:05,520
You don't get this, do you?

3001
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:07,740
We make perfect employees.

3002
03:30:08,840 --> 03:30:18,300
after months that's all we do what do you mean perfect
employees big business needs inspector more than anything

3003
03:30:18,300 --> 03:30:28,540
else is none of this altruistic goody-goody crap what we
look for is people with ambition no ethics push greed is

3004
03:30:28,540 --> 03:30:39,240
good all right we don't deal with all this comfort stuff the
survival of the fittest that's all there is oh my god no big

3005
03:30:39,240 --> 03:30:39,760
plan.

3006
03:30:40,320 --> 03:30:42,280
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow.

3007
03:30:43,260 --> 03:30:46,840
Except what you have and you can enjoy in the here and now.

3008
03:30:48,360 --> 03:30:50,460
And what do you enjoy now, Paul?

3009
03:30:50,740 --> 03:30:51,780
Money, money, money!

3010
03:30:56,760 --> 03:31:00,140
You're gonna have to excuse me, Inspector, I'm a very...

3011
03:31:00,140 --> 03:31:01,040
Yeah, a hobby.

3012
03:31:01,480 --> 03:31:02,440
Nurses, yeah.

3013
03:31:03,940 --> 03:31:05,400
She enjoys the women.

3014
03:31:10,790 --> 03:31:11,870
I'll see myself out.

3015
03:31:15,800 --> 03:31:17,360
Oh my god.

3016
03:31:18,140 --> 03:31:18,620
Oh!

3017
03:31:19,580 --> 03:31:19,960
Hi!

3018
03:31:19,960 --> 03:31:21,080
How do you learn your father?

3019
03:31:22,720 --> 03:31:24,280
Shut the gate on your way out.

3020
03:31:25,380 --> 03:31:26,080
Yeah, it's 11 p.m.

3021
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:26,640
It's midnight.

3022
03:31:26,760 --> 03:31:28,340
I gotta go to sleep.

3023
03:31:30,620 --> 03:31:31,920
We're gonna eat- oh my god.

3024
03:31:36,130 --> 03:31:38,710
He's doing his level best to shut this place down.

3025
03:31:40,010 --> 03:31:40,690
Get rid of him.

3026
03:31:41,130 --> 03:31:41,830
He's a policeman.

3027
03:31:41,970 --> 03:31:46,470
We can't just- You sort this, Ryan.

3028
03:31:47,110 --> 03:31:49,530
You man up and you sort it.

3029
03:31:52,150 --> 03:32:15,630
tonight oh are we in trouble don't hit R1 and see me outside
the window Kyle this is all Kyle's fault wait is he gonna so

3030
03:32:15,630 --> 03:32:21,190
I sit here on my break at work it makes me think blue
raspberry really is the superior fruit flavor candy flavor

3031
03:32:21,190 --> 03:32:26,390
that doesn't sound good two totally morally bankrupt men are
plotting to get rid of me.

3032
03:32:26,770 --> 03:32:27,190
It's midnight.

3033
03:32:27,650 --> 03:32:30,490
I don't have any backup and I don't even have a mobile
phone.

3034
03:32:30,810 --> 03:32:32,530
This is potentially quite bad.

3035
03:32:33,270 --> 03:32:34,530
And what's Kyle got to do with it?

3036
03:32:35,030 --> 03:32:38,110
I think I might make my way over to Atlas while Ryan isn't
there.

3037
03:32:38,350 --> 03:32:39,690
Maybe lock myself in.

3038
03:32:40,350 --> 03:32:42,030
But what if Kyle's in there?

3039
03:32:42,570 --> 03:32:48,190
Oh, so that means the chief is probably like not going to
answer anymore because it's midnight.

3040
03:32:48,790 --> 03:32:50,170
We're all on our own now.

3041
03:32:50,710 --> 03:32:51,370
Chief, wait!

3042
03:32:51,410 --> 03:32:52,510
This is an emergency!

3043
03:32:53,970 --> 03:32:54,450
Please!

3044
03:32:56,050 --> 03:32:57,430
1-1-9!

3045
03:32:57,670 --> 03:32:58,370
9-1-1!

3046
03:32:58,530 --> 03:32:59,990
What do they use in the UK?

3047
03:33:02,930 --> 03:33:04,010
Oh, no!

3048
03:33:04,730 --> 03:33:05,270
Chief!

3049
03:33:06,130 --> 03:33:07,750
Chief, you gotta wake up!

3050
03:33:09,010 --> 03:33:11,890
Oh, calling the chief after midnight!

3051
03:33:13,450 --> 03:33:15,170
Thanks for the double birthday stream!

3052
03:33:15,330 --> 03:33:17,030
These past two months have been great, helpful.

3053
03:33:17,170 --> 03:33:18,710
I've been recovering from knee fracture!

3054
03:33:19,450 --> 03:33:20,870
And your streams have been helping me.

3055
03:33:21,190 --> 03:33:21,990
Death to Quarity!

3056
03:33:22,150 --> 03:33:22,930
Happy birthday!

3057
03:33:23,490 --> 03:33:24,610
Thank you so much for the...

3058
03:33:24,630 --> 03:33:25,930
For the Akasuba!

3059
03:33:26,570 --> 03:33:27,190
Thank you!

3060
03:33:28,030 --> 03:33:28,710
Thank you!

3061
03:33:29,010 --> 03:33:29,510
Thank you!

3062
03:33:30,230 --> 03:33:30,650
Thank you!

3063
03:33:30,870 --> 03:33:31,030
Thank you!

3064
03:33:31,030 --> 03:33:31,390
Thank you!

3065
03:33:32,750 --> 03:33:33,150
999.

3066
03:33:33,370 --> 03:33:34,050
Oh, that's what they use.

3067
03:33:34,890 --> 03:33:34,890
Okay.

3068
03:33:37,950 --> 03:33:38,750
Happy birthday!

3069
03:33:41,010 --> 03:33:42,910
All right, let's go to Atlas then.

3070
03:33:43,630 --> 03:33:44,250
Because we're in trouble.

3071
03:33:46,030 --> 03:33:49,170
Is it gonna tell us to go... It's time for a final trip to
the woods.

3072
03:33:49,750 --> 03:33:51,350
You also have things you're having to ask Simon and Emma
about.

3073
03:33:51,410 --> 03:33:53,470
Okay, let's go ask Simon and Emma real quick.

3074
03:33:55,550 --> 03:33:58,290
I thought we were going to Atlas.

3075
03:33:59,830 --> 03:34:00,790
Not the woods.

3076
03:34:02,810 --> 03:34:03,650
Final trip.

3077
03:34:03,970 --> 03:34:05,930
Okay, Emma, I'm going into your room.

3078
03:34:06,110 --> 03:34:07,150
A few more questions, please.

3079
03:34:07,470 --> 03:34:08,510
Thank you.

3080
03:34:09,850 --> 03:34:13,310
Do you know whether Kate was in the running to be prime
candidate or not?

3081
03:34:13,810 --> 03:34:20,130
I don't, but I do think she would have been chosen just
because she was, you know, Kate.

3082
03:34:21,350 --> 03:34:22,510
You didn't discuss it with Kate.

3083
03:34:22,690 --> 03:34:24,150
Yeah, we won't fast travel to Atlas.

3084
03:34:24,630 --> 03:34:31,550
we'll we'll go through the woods all right let's ask thank
you i wonder if simon's gonna get a little heated about

3085
03:34:31,550 --> 03:34:39,490
hearing that kate's a prime status how do you think you'd
have reacted if you'd found out that kate had been chosen to

3086
03:34:39,490 --> 03:34:50,170
be prime candidate is that was she i'm just asking how you
think you'd react i don't know i wouldn't react in any way

3087
03:34:50,170 --> 03:34:58,150
really i'm not bothered i don't think she was though oh what
makes you think that well it's just an impression i got you

3088
03:34:58,150 --> 03:35:09,010
know she's a bit flaky to be honest it's just not really
prime candidate material uh-huh i think he's bothered i

3089
03:35:09,010 --> 03:35:13,050
think he's bothered that's it for the time being thank you
all right

3090
03:35:16,290 --> 03:35:24,250
she's just not okay goodbye bike well i might never see you
again i might get shot in the woods Okay, I won't get shot.

3091
03:35:24,630 --> 03:35:26,010
I might get knifed in the woods.

3092
03:35:29,870 --> 03:35:30,750
Oh, geez.

3093
03:35:36,310 --> 03:35:38,690
Oh, God.

3094
03:35:38,830 --> 03:35:40,570
They're going to get me on the jetty where we found her
body.

3095
03:35:40,990 --> 03:35:42,010
Those guys are still fishing.

3096
03:35:42,170 --> 03:35:42,570
It's midnight.

3097
03:35:42,870 --> 03:35:43,290
Go home.

3098
03:35:43,430 --> 03:35:44,690
There's a serial killer.

3099
03:35:45,730 --> 03:35:47,270
Kyle's on the loobus.

3100
03:35:50,150 --> 03:35:51,170
In the clearing.

3101
03:35:55,000 --> 03:35:55,260
Oh!

3102
03:35:55,860 --> 03:35:56,340
Oh, shh.

3103
03:35:56,540 --> 03:35:56,760
Okay.

3104
03:35:57,140 --> 03:35:57,840
What's happening?

3105
03:35:58,420 --> 03:35:58,820
Oh!

3106
03:36:20,360 --> 03:36:21,480
What is this?

3107
03:36:21,960 --> 03:36:22,660
What the hell?

3108
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:23,620
Scotland Yard.

3109
03:36:24,340 --> 03:36:24,600
Not hell.

3110
03:36:25,520 --> 03:36:27,200
Hello, Inspector.

3111
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:28,200
What are you doing here?

3112
03:36:28,300 --> 03:36:30,120
Um, you might want to like let her go with the knife.

3113
03:36:30,320 --> 03:36:31,300
Oh my god, he does have a knife!

3114
03:36:31,460 --> 03:36:31,500
Come on.

3115
03:36:32,340 --> 03:36:39,220
let's have it i don't think you'd understand inspector the
best thing that you can do is turn around go away and leave

3116
03:36:39,220 --> 03:36:49,180
us to it knife knife what that knife gives me a perfect
right to stick my nose in investigate and interfere this is

3117
03:36:49,180 --> 03:37:04,700
all part of the atlas course it's a physical endurance
exercise drop the knife kyle kyle drop it Oh my god!

3118
03:37:04,700 --> 03:37:06,340
Drop it.

3119
03:37:11,920 --> 03:37:14,120
Not looking 100% brilliant for you, Ryan.

3120
03:37:14,520 --> 03:37:21,460
Well, please, Inspector, you've poked your nose into Atlas's
affairs enough times to know that Imaginative Flair is part

3121
03:37:21,460 --> 03:37:22,960
of the course of success.

3122
03:37:23,660 --> 03:37:27,620
Our lessons are reinforced by a unique emotional experience.

3123
03:37:27,980 --> 03:37:31,140
I almost feel like they should have let her die so that they
could have it.

3124
03:37:31,380 --> 03:37:32,520
Extremely evocative, too.

3125
03:37:32,920 --> 03:37:35,200
Well, it's a good job you're not in charge of the national
curriculum.

3126
03:37:36,300 --> 03:37:38,880
Now look, Inspector, I know what you're trying to do.

3127
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:40,720
I know what you're thinking.

3128
03:37:41,420 --> 03:37:45,240
But believe me, Atlas had nothing to do with the deaths of
those people.

3129
03:37:45,300 --> 03:37:47,000
Oh, you had a guy who was literally...

3130
03:37:47,740 --> 03:37:48,440
...sacrifice in the woods.

3131
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:51,300
That's not what we call circumstantial evidence, Ryan.

3132
03:37:52,200 --> 03:37:52,600
Simon.

3133
03:37:53,320 --> 03:37:56,860
Now, I saw Simon walking home with Kate last Friday after
the meeting.

3134
03:37:57,300 --> 03:38:01,300
Now, Simon had some strange idea that he was in the running
to become prime candidate.

3135
03:38:02,040 --> 03:38:04,580
Well, a knob of butter has more chance of becoming prime
minister.

3136
03:38:05,020 --> 03:38:05,460
Oh, wait.

3137
03:38:05,920 --> 03:38:12,500
so are you telling oh wait what does that mean killed her
well it seems reasonable it's likely isn't it i don't

3138
03:38:12,500 --> 03:38:25,380
believe you any more likely than you ryan let's get you home
mysterious girl we don't know who you are big punch him oh

3139
03:38:25,380 --> 03:38:27,580
yeah i know police brutality

3140
03:38:30,600 --> 03:38:37,000
it's all right are you okay

3141
03:38:41,360 --> 03:38:44,540
now in my cape in my mask

3142
03:38:48,700 --> 03:38:55,080
you save someone from being sacrificed and that's the thanks
you get if that wasn't an occult ceremony i don't know what

3143
03:38:55,080 --> 03:39:06,060
is yeah the rams have been lying all along but what's simon
going to say about ryan's accusation crazy work um so we are

3144
03:39:06,060 --> 03:39:14,080
going to atlas oh what does simon oh we have to go I thought
we were going to Atlas when he wasn't there.

3145
03:39:14,540 --> 03:39:16,580
I thought we were gonna lock ourselves in.

3146
03:39:16,680 --> 03:39:19,220
I thought we were, I thought that was the plan.

3147
03:39:21,200 --> 03:39:21,320
Oh.

3148
03:39:21,380 --> 03:39:21,700
Damn.

3149
03:39:22,620 --> 03:39:25,320
I suppose it was too much to hope that Ryan had left the
place open.

3150
03:39:25,640 --> 03:39:25,860
Oh, okay.

3151
03:39:27,080 --> 03:39:28,340
Now, now I'm understanding.

3152
03:39:28,540 --> 03:39:29,800
All right, let's go talk to Simon.

3153
03:39:33,480 --> 03:39:35,840
Simon, was it you?

3154
03:39:37,280 --> 03:39:38,200
Was it you?

3155
03:39:38,940 --> 03:39:40,560
Ask you a couple more things, please.

3156
03:39:40,840 --> 03:39:41,580
Is it you?

3157
03:39:44,720 --> 03:39:51,760
What would you say if I said it's been suggested that you
were seen walking home with Kate after Atlas last Friday?

3158
03:39:52,300 --> 03:39:52,300
What?

3159
03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:53,280
By who?

3160
03:39:53,460 --> 03:39:59,300
The same person who suggested that you wanted Kate out of
the picture because you found out she was in the running to

3161
03:39:59,300 --> 03:40:00,320
be prime candidate.

3162
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:02,280
Who said that?

3163
03:40:02,400 --> 03:40:03,060
Just a question.

3164
03:40:03,600 --> 03:40:04,980
I didn't think I was in the running.

3165
03:40:06,600 --> 03:40:07,740
It was Ryan, wasn't it?

3166
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:09,840
I am in no position to say.

3167
03:40:10,840 --> 03:40:18,580
there's five people in this village i can prove it kate's
driving license give it to me why kate's driving license

3168
03:40:18,580 --> 03:40:30,050
please what about see that pattern on the tape there yeah
let me show you something washi tape

3169
03:40:34,010 --> 03:40:43,890
see this pattern it literally is washi tape it's the same
pattern this has come from the same roll of tape as this.

3170
03:40:43,970 --> 03:40:45,730
Wait, why is that sicker then?

3171
03:40:45,770 --> 03:40:47,630
So there's only one person that's taped like that.

3172
03:40:50,350 --> 03:40:52,850
He gave me this piece of tape when I was in his office once.

3173
03:40:54,770 --> 03:40:58,610
Why, as Kate's driving license, got a piece of Ryan's tape
on it.

3174
03:40:58,830 --> 03:40:59,930
I have no idea, son.

3175
03:41:00,170 --> 03:41:02,230
Oh, did the subtitle say roll, like, R-O-L-E?

3176
03:41:02,470 --> 03:41:03,150
That's funny.

3177
03:41:03,470 --> 03:41:04,550
Well, that's obvious, isn't it?

3178
03:41:05,950 --> 03:41:07,650
Ryan was testing her.

3179
03:41:08,330 --> 03:41:17,050
He was doing a boundary test to see how much she would do,
you would go to be a prime candidate but it all went wrong

3180
03:41:17,050 --> 03:41:25,510
okay it's one of the things we do at the course right you
give something that's important to you to someone else such

3181
03:41:25,510 --> 03:41:32,550
a weak argument they go and hide it somewhere it's to teach
you to not be bothered when you lose something that's

3182
03:41:32,550 --> 03:41:43,390
important that's the wrong lose that's loose gives her
driving license to Ryan Ryan goes where did the She goes

3183
03:41:43,390 --> 03:41:44,670
down looking for it.

3184
03:41:45,270 --> 03:41:46,010
Probably drunk.

3185
03:41:46,190 --> 03:41:47,330
Only he has the tape.

3186
03:41:47,350 --> 03:41:48,370
She falls in.

3187
03:41:50,730 --> 03:41:53,350
I'm afraid I find that a bit far-fetched, Simon.

3188
03:41:53,690 --> 03:41:57,750
It makes perfect sense if you know anything at all about how
Atlas works.

3189
03:41:58,030 --> 03:42:03,090
But Simon, if you got the tape from Ryan, Kate could have
got it from him.

3190
03:42:03,430 --> 03:42:04,730
He told me he doesn't lend it out.

3191
03:42:04,930 --> 03:42:06,250
He lent it to you.

3192
03:42:06,510 --> 03:42:06,630
Oh.

3193
03:42:07,190 --> 03:42:08,290
But I didn't kill her.

3194
03:42:09,170 --> 03:42:10,630
Do a lab test on the card.

3195
03:42:12,210 --> 03:42:21,450
will be all over it and what if yours is all over it it
won't be I didn't kill Emma in the other room hearing all of

3196
03:42:21,450 --> 03:42:29,890
this screaming just just give me a minute I need I need some
painkillers oh he's taking the opium wait a second we're

3197
03:42:29,890 --> 03:42:38,190
just gonna let him do this wait a second what

3198
03:42:44,740 --> 03:43:00,780
is happening wait did he just leave did he oh oh oh sorry my
game he go in such a hurry he trying to act as suspiciously

3199
03:43:00,780 --> 03:43:19,430
as possible wait I'm so confused her driving oh I guess it
did have this tape but like why like why is the bike gone

3200
03:43:19,430 --> 03:43:24,630
into the woods To the jetty.

3201
03:43:26,290 --> 03:43:26,790
No.

3202
03:43:32,850 --> 03:43:33,350
Uh...

3203
03:43:33,350 --> 03:43:33,830
Into the wit.

3204
03:43:35,410 --> 03:43:36,110
Into the clearing.

3205
03:43:37,870 --> 03:43:38,810
I'm back.

3206
03:43:39,010 --> 03:43:39,970
He went to Atlas.

3207
03:43:51,920 --> 03:43:53,140
Where the hell did he go?

3208
03:43:54,020 --> 03:43:55,320
The bike is still here.

3209
03:43:59,130 --> 03:43:59,570
Emma?

3210
03:43:59,990 --> 03:44:01,890
Just a few more questions if you don't mind.

3211
03:44:03,710 --> 03:44:05,330
Have you seen this anywhere before?

3212
03:44:07,310 --> 03:44:10,090
I've seen it somewhere, but can't remember.

3213
03:44:12,650 --> 03:44:13,270
Sorry, no.

3214
03:44:16,190 --> 03:44:20,090
Only Ryan uses washi tape in this entire village.

3215
03:44:20,090 --> 03:44:22,930
Did Simon mention walking home with anyone after the meeting
last Friday?

3216
03:44:23,510 --> 03:44:24,350
No, he just came home.

3217
03:44:24,630 --> 03:44:24,630
Why?

3218
03:44:24,990 --> 03:44:26,510
He didn't mention walking home with Kate.

3219
03:44:26,930 --> 03:44:27,850
No, definitely not.

3220
03:44:30,070 --> 03:44:35,710
Your boyfriend might be an OPM at the attic.

3221
03:44:35,870 --> 03:44:40,150
Who murdered Kate out of jealousy for her prime status?

3222
03:44:41,310 --> 03:44:42,790
Oh my gosh, Amazon Prime.

3223
03:44:45,750 --> 03:44:48,130
Ryan knit the tape together himself.

3224
03:44:50,490 --> 03:44:55,190
Um, wait, let's go.

3225
03:44:55,390 --> 03:44:57,870
We don't go like to this village hall very often.

3226
03:45:00,450 --> 03:45:02,650
Bike is just sitting back watching it all.

3227
03:45:02,710 --> 03:45:11,350
I can't believe we came here to this area for literally one
thing it was those keys and we've never been back here since

3228
03:45:11,350 --> 03:45:22,970
oh my god I've been thinking like oh surely there's
something ask about a few more things

3229
03:45:28,480 --> 03:45:35,340
please have you seen patterned tape like this anywhere
before Ryan's favorite he painted oh Ryan's got some I know

3230
03:45:35,340 --> 03:45:41,060
cuz I borrowed it when was that a couple of months ago have
you still got it I don't think so.

3231
03:45:41,280 --> 03:45:42,040
I haven't seen it since then.

3232
03:45:44,120 --> 03:45:44,120
Okay.

3233
03:45:44,440 --> 03:45:46,480
I saw the tape approximately two months ago.

3234
03:45:46,540 --> 03:45:47,380
That's all for the moment.

3235
03:45:47,600 --> 03:45:48,080
Thank you.

3236
03:45:49,660 --> 03:45:51,240
He's a washi tape dealer.

3237
03:45:52,840 --> 03:45:53,860
Is he getting a drink?

3238
03:45:54,360 --> 03:45:54,520
Simon?

3239
03:45:54,760 --> 03:45:55,800
Simon, where did you go?

3240
03:45:56,260 --> 03:45:56,620
Simon?

3241
03:45:59,220 --> 03:45:59,660
Simon?

3242
03:45:59,960 --> 03:46:01,100
Oh, you can't go to there.

3243
03:46:01,640 --> 03:46:02,220
Hold on.

3244
03:46:02,740 --> 03:46:03,740
You should call the chief.

3245
03:46:04,860 --> 03:46:05,720
I thought we were...

3246
03:46:05,720 --> 03:46:07,140
I thought that guy was asleep.

3247
03:46:10,920 --> 03:46:13,140
Wait, I thought the chief was asleep.

3248
03:46:17,820 --> 03:46:19,220
What do you mean?

3249
03:46:19,980 --> 03:46:21,400
Couple more questions, if that's okay.

3250
03:46:21,660 --> 03:46:22,300
If that's okay?

3251
03:46:23,460 --> 03:46:25,740
Detective Jenks, it's 1am, please.

3252
03:46:28,760 --> 03:46:31,520
Do you know how well Simon knew Kate?

3253
03:46:32,060 --> 03:46:32,580
Not really.

3254
03:46:32,880 --> 03:46:34,080
Did you ever see them together?

3255
03:46:34,500 --> 03:46:35,080
No, why?

3256
03:46:35,140 --> 03:46:36,040
Do you think he killed her?

3257
03:46:36,420 --> 03:46:36,720
Maybe.

3258
03:46:37,140 --> 03:46:38,580
My game is glitching so bad.

3259
03:46:38,580 --> 03:46:40,380
Do you think he'd be capable of that?

3260
03:46:40,680 --> 03:46:41,180
Stuttering so bad.

3261
03:46:41,260 --> 03:46:42,860
Don't you think we're all capable of it?

3262
03:46:43,540 --> 03:46:44,220
No, I don't.

3263
03:46:44,740 --> 03:46:45,060
Sure.

3264
03:46:46,180 --> 03:46:52,360
So you've never been in your police car responding to an
incident driven past a school at high speed.

3265
03:46:53,420 --> 03:46:53,920
I don't know.

3266
03:46:55,160 --> 03:46:55,480
Maybe.

3267
03:46:56,360 --> 03:46:58,040
Well, you've answered your own question then.

3268
03:46:58,820 --> 03:47:02,660
When you've got a need and things get in your way, it's
human nature to either...

3269
03:47:02,660 --> 03:47:03,520
Monitor issue.

3270
03:47:03,640 --> 03:47:06,100
You know I have been having issues at this monitor too.

3271
03:47:06,220 --> 03:47:07,080
Any way you can.

3272
03:47:07,140 --> 03:47:09,500
I've been having issues with so many things.

3273
03:47:10,100 --> 03:47:10,840
All my stuff is...

3274
03:47:10,840 --> 03:47:11,440
Maybe you're right.

3275
03:47:11,760 --> 03:47:12,900
Not even that old.

3276
03:47:13,640 --> 03:47:15,420
I've been kind of frustrated about it.

3277
03:47:17,180 --> 03:47:19,360
Ever seen tape like this anywhere before?

3278
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:20,320
No.

3279
03:47:22,300 --> 03:47:22,940
No.

3280
03:47:24,660 --> 03:47:25,300
No.

3281
03:47:25,680 --> 03:47:27,560
No, but I don't know anything.

3282
03:47:28,520 --> 03:47:31,260
I'm just James.

3283
03:47:32,820 --> 03:47:35,620
It said we had three things we didn't ask James about.

3284
03:47:36,320 --> 03:47:37,120
I don't believe you.

3285
03:47:37,140 --> 03:47:38,640
I think I've asked him everything.

3286
03:47:39,440 --> 03:47:41,180
I'm just James.

3287
03:47:41,500 --> 03:47:42,720
I don't know anything.

3288
03:47:43,960 --> 03:47:44,440
Now.

3289
03:47:45,260 --> 03:47:45,680
Now.

3290
03:47:46,580 --> 03:47:47,840
I don't know anything.

3291
03:47:47,940 --> 03:47:49,500
Be that later on if that's okay.

3292
03:47:52,520 --> 03:47:53,040
I know.

3293
03:47:53,160 --> 03:47:54,400
He didn't even look at the tape.

3294
03:47:55,320 --> 03:47:56,720
He doesn't believe in washi tape.

3295
03:47:58,380 --> 03:48:02,140
All right, let's go call the chief, I guess, because...

3296
03:48:02,720 --> 03:48:03,200
Chief?

3297
03:48:14,480 --> 03:48:14,960
Oh.

3298
03:48:15,120 --> 03:48:16,360
Just as I guessed, the good...

3299
03:48:16,380 --> 03:48:25,280
it great go on Jenks so where to start Paul admitted that
they do use threshold testing apparently they get a wedge of

3300
03:48:25,280 --> 03:48:31,500
cash from various companies in exchange for each prime
candidate they produce interesting also I met Ryan and some

3301
03:48:31,500 --> 03:48:37,560
of you know chief someone did die in the woods in the middle
of some sort of occult two people actually I have no idea

3302
03:48:37,560 --> 03:48:43,620
what they were doing and then we saw good but Ryan almost
gets dad Simon walks Kate home after the meeting last Friday

3303
03:48:43,620 --> 03:48:47,400
he's claiming Simon killed her and what does Simon say He
doesn't agree.

3304
03:48:47,640 --> 03:48:48,240
Not surprisingly.

3305
03:48:48,780 --> 03:48:54,080
He says it was Ryan, because there's something to do with a
piece of tape stuck to Kate's driving license, which Simon

3306
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:55,620
claims belonged to Ryan.

3307
03:48:55,980 --> 03:49:01,400
Claims it was Ryan who was testing Kate by sticking the
driving license to a tree in the woods in the dark and

3308
03:49:01,400 --> 03:49:03,600
telling Kate to get it, knowing she'd fall in.

3309
03:49:03,860 --> 03:49:07,160
And no, before you ask, it doesn't make any sense to me
either.

3310
03:49:07,520 --> 03:49:11,380
Right, so basically Simon says Ryan was testing her and Ryan
says Simon was testing her.

3311
03:49:11,800 --> 03:49:14,280
Simon says, either of them is mine or neither of them are.

3312
03:49:14,600 --> 03:49:16,140
And nobody who is testing anybody.

3313
03:49:16,380 --> 03:49:20,980
suppose that's always a possibility wouldn't surprise me
jenks well i don't know i care

3314
03:49:26,770 --> 03:49:32,190
everyone's statements the answers in there somewhere call me
back when there's some good news hey preferably a confession

3315
03:49:32,190 --> 03:49:41,890
i mean if i can get them yeah thanks chief good night the
heck was that screaming did you guys hear that was that too

3316
03:49:41,890 --> 03:49:48,510
quiet on the street it was like ah is it gonna say find the
contradiction

3317
03:49:52,170 --> 03:49:55,330
We have a million info.

3318
03:49:55,850 --> 03:49:56,270
Wait, okay.

3319
03:49:56,450 --> 03:49:59,150
But we also can only talk to two people right now.

3320
03:50:00,390 --> 03:50:03,930
We can only talk to Rebecca and Emma.

3321
03:50:04,170 --> 03:50:05,010
No, sorry, three people.

3322
03:50:05,590 --> 03:50:07,430
We can talk to James, Rebecca, and Emma.

3323
03:50:17,920 --> 03:50:18,520
I

3324
03:50:29,110 --> 03:50:29,710
think...

3325
03:50:29,710 --> 03:50:30,850
Oh, my God.

3326
03:50:45,280 --> 03:50:47,100
Let's go start with Emma.

3327
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:54,840
didn't rebecca use the tape to tape up the broken window

3328
03:51:06,000 --> 03:51:14,580
i mean she did use a she did use a tape we can't say which
tape we could go check the tape and see

3329
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:26,240
i can't see what does it say oh let's go we can we can try
that

3330
03:51:30,320 --> 03:51:42,400
i guess it's a matter of who had the tape right is that what
it all comes down to is the tape a few more questions please

3331
03:51:43,060 --> 03:51:45,180
yeah i might have to replay the cinematic that's true

3332
03:51:48,480 --> 03:51:59,500
taped over last saw the tape two months ago oh my god are
you freaking kidding me you last saw that sticky tape two is

3333
03:51:59,500 --> 03:52:06,020
there only one roll of tape in this entire village so how
come you used last week to tape over the broken window

3334
03:52:06,020 --> 03:52:06,580
outside.

3335
03:52:07,060 --> 03:52:08,220
That's the same tape.

3336
03:52:08,600 --> 03:52:10,540
That washing tape is not even that reliable.

3337
03:52:10,960 --> 03:52:18,240
You see, the reason I'm asking is that it's exactly the same
tape that was found attached to Kate's driving license found

3338
03:52:18,240 --> 03:52:18,980
at the scene.

3339
03:52:19,420 --> 03:52:21,820
The tape that only Ryan has.

3340
03:52:22,260 --> 03:52:25,200
Ryan and of course... Why washing tape a window?

3341
03:52:25,300 --> 03:52:26,340
It won't even hold!

3342
03:52:26,740 --> 03:52:27,700
So what are you saying?

3343
03:52:28,600 --> 03:52:30,020
Who's got the tape now?

3344
03:52:30,960 --> 03:52:31,980
Do you know where it is?

3345
03:52:32,300 --> 03:52:32,640
No.

3346
03:52:33,220 --> 03:52:33,600
No, I don't.

3347
03:52:33,620 --> 03:52:41,020
know where it is why are you asking me about this tape you
seem nervous rebecca is there a problem well you're

3348
03:52:41,020 --> 03:52:47,400
practically accusing me of having something to do with that
woman's murder aren't you i wasn't accusing you of anything

3349
03:52:47,400 --> 03:52:54,700
rebecca unless there's something you'd like to tell me no i
wouldn't like to tell you anything okay well that's fine

3350
03:52:54,700 --> 03:53:04,060
obviously uh we'll be swabbing everyone in the area for dna
so if anything comes up on kate's license dna traces What'll

3351
03:53:04,060 --> 03:53:04,660
come up?

3352
03:53:05,140 --> 03:53:06,100
Nothing'll come up.

3353
03:53:06,520 --> 03:53:07,320
Right, I've had enough.

3354
03:53:07,440 --> 03:53:08,080
I've got to get back.

3355
03:53:11,280 --> 03:53:15,700
Would you like to explain to me exactly what is going on?

3356
03:53:16,060 --> 03:53:16,460
Which bit?

3357
03:53:16,560 --> 03:53:18,920
The fact that some leggy bitch was trying to steal my
husband?

3358
03:53:19,500 --> 03:53:19,740
Oh!

3359
03:53:20,880 --> 03:53:24,340
I think you had better tell me what you know, Rebecca.

3360
03:53:24,620 --> 03:53:24,840
Oh!

3361
03:53:25,960 --> 03:53:27,860
Okay, you want to know what I know?

3362
03:53:28,960 --> 03:53:33,240
Kate Vine seduced my husband and was going to blackmail him.

3363
03:53:33,240 --> 03:53:34,320
Oh, I think you got the wrong girl.

3364
03:53:34,320 --> 03:53:38,420
Not only did she sleep with him, that whore did it just for
his money, our money.

3365
03:53:39,400 --> 03:53:40,600
How did you work that out?

3366
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:41,980
I heard her.

3367
03:53:42,340 --> 03:53:44,900
I knew it was her arguing with Emma Bowman.

3368
03:53:45,660 --> 03:53:46,880
Emma was trying to talk her out of it.

3369
03:53:47,460 --> 03:53:49,620
And how did she come to be at the lake?

3370
03:53:50,800 --> 03:53:54,760
She dropped that driving license thing when she came in.

3371
03:53:55,180 --> 03:53:55,880
Driving license thing.

3372
03:53:56,240 --> 03:53:56,540
She dropped a bag.

3373
03:53:56,660 --> 03:53:59,120
I took it out to the woods and stuck it over the lake.

3374
03:53:59,600 --> 03:54:00,520
Then I waited for her.

3375
03:54:01,460 --> 03:54:09,100
when she came out I I told her where it was said someone had
just run off into the woods with it you led her to the lake

3376
03:54:10,820 --> 03:54:21,420
she was reaching out over the lake to get it I didn't do
anything she just fell in couldn't let her drown it was dark

3377
03:54:21,420 --> 03:54:31,100
I couldn't see anything I couldn't help her really did you
try Rebecca when it was too late she was just about in the

3378
03:54:31,100 --> 03:54:38,740
water it was pathetic she was making these gurgling sounds
that sounds like somebody drowning i just pushed her down

3379
03:54:38,740 --> 03:54:47,820
with it until she stopped well she was dead anyway what did
it matter you killed her rebecca she slept with my husband

3380
03:54:47,820 --> 03:54:57,040
she didn't rebecca what do you mean you got the wrong girl
oh but who

3381
03:55:00,520 --> 03:55:01,120
Emma.

3382
03:55:02,820 --> 03:55:03,920
It was Emma.

3383
03:55:05,380 --> 03:55:06,640
I have to go kill Emma.

3384
03:55:06,880 --> 03:55:11,140
Rebecca Rand, I am arresting you for the murder of Kate
Vine.

3385
03:55:11,240 --> 03:55:11,660
Oh my!

3386
03:55:11,840 --> 03:55:18,780
You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may
be taken down and will be used in evidence against you.

3387
03:55:19,860 --> 03:55:20,600
Do you understand?

3388
03:55:23,880 --> 03:55:24,520
Yes.

3389
03:55:25,360 --> 03:55:25,720
Sorry.

3390
03:55:27,000 --> 03:55:27,640
No.

3391
03:55:28,320 --> 03:55:28,820
No.

3392
03:55:28,840 --> 03:55:29,200
No.

3393
03:55:29,520 --> 03:55:29,940
No.

3394
03:55:30,520 --> 03:55:37,280
that Kate's vine's death was a tragic case of mistaken
identity but there are some loose threads here yes there are

3395
03:55:37,280 --> 03:55:45,340
what was Ryan doing with Kyle and that girl in the woods I
hadn't interrupted and what really happened to Liam last

3396
03:55:45,340 --> 03:55:52,500
year it seems I've only scratched the surface of Atlas and
the Rand business empire trying to find out about Paul

3397
03:55:52,500 --> 03:56:00,460
Rand's past is like peering into dense fog he gives nothing
away and covers his tracks with military efficiency however

3398
03:56:00,520 --> 03:56:05,540
What is known is that Paul Rand has a lot of connections in
higher places.

3399
03:56:05,900 --> 03:56:07,360
Oh my god.

3400
03:56:08,780 --> 03:56:13,360
Perhaps James Wilson's ideas weren't too wide of the mark
after all.

3401
03:56:13,900 --> 03:56:14,500
Oh my god.

3402
03:56:14,800 --> 03:56:19,360
There's still a lot more to learn about the Rand business
empire.

3403
03:56:19,680 --> 03:56:21,280
You don't have to excuse us.

3404
03:56:21,800 --> 03:56:23,400
Atlas is closed for the moment.

3405
03:56:24,380 --> 03:56:26,820
But we'll be open again very soon.

3406
03:56:28,420 --> 03:56:30,120
And thanks for your interest.

3407
03:56:37,000 --> 03:56:37,660
That's...

3408
03:56:37,660 --> 03:56:40,520
Oh my god!

3409
03:56:41,240 --> 03:56:42,740
All of that happened.

3410
03:56:43,160 --> 03:56:43,920
The cold.

3411
03:56:44,360 --> 03:56:45,440
The devil worship.

3412
03:56:46,180 --> 03:56:47,740
The sacrifices.

3413
03:56:47,940 --> 03:56:49,840
What about the other guy that died?

3414
03:56:51,360 --> 03:56:52,660
All for it to be.

3415
03:56:53,060 --> 03:56:53,860
The wife?

3416
03:56:58,560 --> 03:56:58,890
I...

3417
03:56:59,220 --> 03:57:00,500
You know, I'm totally fine.

3418
03:57:00,520 --> 03:57:04,840
with it being someone that is like a, like a twist villain!

3419
03:57:06,280 --> 03:57:13,880
But oh my oh my god, oh my god.

3420
03:57:16,280 --> 03:57:18,780
What happened to the guy that died before?

3421
03:57:18,820 --> 03:57:20,360
Maybe he really did just kill himself.

3422
03:57:20,980 --> 03:57:21,980
Is this cinema?

3423
03:57:23,040 --> 03:57:24,940
Snape was the good guy in the end.

3424
03:57:25,120 --> 03:57:26,000
I wouldn't say that.

3425
03:57:26,220 --> 03:57:28,860
I think he's just the innocent guy at the end.

3426
03:57:31,040 --> 03:57:32,440
What?

3427
03:57:33,620 --> 03:57:34,100
I...

3428
03:57:34,100 --> 03:57:35,100
I...

3429
03:57:38,240 --> 03:57:38,940
I...

3430
03:57:43,310 --> 03:57:45,150
Oh, Kickstarter!

3431
03:57:45,750 --> 03:57:46,250
Wow!

3432
03:57:47,630 --> 03:57:50,590
Oh my...

3433
03:57:52,750 --> 03:57:54,150
Oh...

3434
03:57:54,150 --> 03:57:54,850
Oh...

3435
03:57:55,530 --> 03:57:57,550
Where did Simon go?

3436
03:58:01,010 --> 03:58:03,210
What is this?

3437
03:58:07,950 --> 03:58:23,160
all you need to do to crack the case was a roll of tape i'm
i have no she was a femme fatale all along this was an

3438
03:58:23,160 --> 03:58:28,380
experimental independent game made on a tiny budget if you
liked it please leave a review of the game and make yourself

3439
03:58:28,380 --> 03:58:32,560
heard oh i'm so

3440
03:58:48,800 --> 03:58:52,680
the end is cinema just for this reaction

3441
03:58:55,960 --> 03:59:02,160
but did kate try simon's whole brew he was a leader of a
cult with connections at high places who might have

3442
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:13,620
disappeared a guy but he isn't part of this case also it
says my progress is 96 percent maybe i missed a

3443
03:59:13,620 --> 03:59:27,420
contradiction i think the most baffling thing about this no
everything is baffling i'm sorry a part that really baffles

3444
03:59:27,420 --> 03:59:35,000
me is she's just like yeah she slipped into the lake and
then she was making gurgling sounds and splashing everywhere

3445
03:59:35,000 --> 03:59:46,720
so i took the stick and just poked her in a little bit like
she was making a stew like she was just like i don't that

3446
03:59:46,720 --> 03:59:54,060
was a ride can you unlock this mirror room now it feels
really interesting but not at all built on the wait built

3447
03:59:54,300 --> 03:59:54,720
Wait.

3448
03:59:55,340 --> 03:59:57,040
Oh, can you unlock this mirror room?

3449
03:59:57,200 --> 04:00:00,940
It feels really interesting, but not at all built on, and
the door still stuck.

3450
04:00:04,260 --> 04:00:05,300
I'm so...

3451
04:00:06,500 --> 04:00:08,980
It wasn't even a murder until the stick.

3452
04:00:09,340 --> 04:00:10,100
I'm stuck.

3453
04:00:12,560 --> 04:00:17,780
I thought she was gonna say I took the stick and held it out
for her to grab.

3454
04:00:18,240 --> 04:00:18,680
No, no.

3455
04:00:19,320 --> 04:00:20,300
You just...

3456
04:00:20,300 --> 04:00:21,020
You just...

3457
04:00:21,020 --> 04:00:22,700
It's like she was a...

3458
04:00:22,700 --> 04:00:30,980
like she was a carrot floating in your stew and you needed
her to just poked her down a little to cook some more the

3459
04:00:30,980 --> 04:00:35,160
folks that made this are working on a new game that's
supposed to come out this year i don't think they've

3460
04:00:35,160 --> 04:00:40,440
announced a name yet ah we need contradiction too because
what the hell

3461
04:00:43,580 --> 04:00:58,540
is there a what are there achievements for this game is
there a different ending we can get oh oh uh no cheats used

3462
04:01:03,010 --> 04:01:06,330
game completed with no cheats are those

3463
04:01:10,100 --> 04:01:17,660
are the two locked achievements there's a one no cheats used
you didn't use any cheats during 9 p.m.

3464
04:01:17,840 --> 04:01:27,840
and then game completed with no cheats so much build up for
the ending to just move on from it it's just so confused the

3465
04:01:27,840 --> 04:01:34,220
tape thing reminds me of heavy rain where the FBI guy uses
the gold watch to prove that the origami killer was a former

3466
04:01:34,220 --> 04:01:45,980
cop because no one else yeah the watch is only for cops that
retire literally no one else has that watch no one else uses

3467
04:01:45,980 --> 04:01:55,480
this tape i'm i'm also just using washi tape to tape up the
window

3468
04:01:58,900 --> 04:02:11,660
you look at it it unpeels itself like it's so i am in such
what what what the

3469
04:02:20,040 --> 04:02:21,940
hell was this game

3470
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:33,160
oh oh hi raiders i didn't realize it got raided i just
finished the game thank you so much whoever raided me thank

3471
04:02:33,160 --> 04:02:37,620
you thank you sgf2 thank you so much for the gifted i

3472
04:02:41,320 --> 04:02:43,040
I don't know what to say.

3473
04:02:43,200 --> 04:02:44,220
Oh, Nyaru, thank you!

3474
04:02:50,160 --> 04:02:51,240
I'm so...

3475
04:02:51,240 --> 04:02:52,220
My goodness.

3476
04:02:58,150 --> 04:02:58,550
Wow.

3477
04:02:59,390 --> 04:03:01,050
Thank you so much for that.

3478
04:03:01,050 --> 04:03:04,450
I feel like the entire game was a red herring.

3479
04:03:05,670 --> 04:03:07,190
For example, thank you so much for that.

3480
04:03:07,410 --> 04:03:07,510
Thank you!

3481
04:03:09,190 --> 04:03:09,730
Oh.

3482
04:03:11,690 --> 04:03:14,830
This concludes the washi tape murder and nothing else.

3483
04:03:15,990 --> 04:03:20,730
Are we I'm not even going to get Kyle for the attempted
murder.

3484
04:03:21,610 --> 04:03:24,710
He was holding a lady up at knife point.

3485
04:03:25,490 --> 04:03:28,430
And she just, everybody just walks into the woods and
leaves.

3486
04:03:29,050 --> 04:03:29,630
That's it.

3487
04:03:30,030 --> 04:03:31,110
T-cup, thank you.

3488
04:03:31,430 --> 04:03:32,230
Thanks for the gifted.

3489
04:03:34,910 --> 04:03:37,350
No, well, thank you so much for the 20-cup, thank you.

3490
04:03:38,330 --> 04:03:40,110
Yeah, he also mugged me.

3491
04:03:40,410 --> 04:03:42,590
It was just...

3492
04:03:43,770 --> 04:03:44,370
Oh...

3493
04:03:46,490 --> 04:03:47,350
Wow.

3494
04:03:52,290 --> 04:03:52,990
Wow.

3495
04:03:53,350 --> 04:03:55,370
Thank you so much for the fight.

3496
04:03:55,610 --> 04:03:55,850
Get there.

3497
04:03:57,490 --> 04:03:58,790
This was so funny.

3498
04:04:04,330 --> 04:04:05,530
This game was so funny.

3499
04:04:08,550 --> 04:04:10,250
I'm glad I played it.

3500
04:04:12,210 --> 04:04:14,990
And also, I'm very confused.

3501
04:04:17,670 --> 04:04:19,330
Is that 4% important?

3502
04:04:19,470 --> 04:04:20,090
I have no idea.

3503
04:04:20,230 --> 04:04:21,910
I wonder if it's because I use the cheat.

3504
04:04:23,830 --> 04:04:25,110
I have no idea.

3505
04:04:28,850 --> 04:04:31,770
Or maybe there was like one contradiction that I didn't
catch.

3506
04:04:38,080 --> 04:04:39,740
Wait, there's a final credit scene?

3507
04:04:39,880 --> 04:04:40,620
Wait, what do you mean?

3508
04:04:43,880 --> 04:04:44,280
Oh.

3509
04:04:45,260 --> 04:04:45,660
Oh

3510
04:04:49,430 --> 04:04:51,350
yeah, I didn't talk to James, I guess, either.

3511
04:04:51,490 --> 04:04:52,790
Maybe the sequel will be out.

3512
04:04:53,830 --> 04:05:10,700
been 11 years I'm just it was so like oh yeah they she was
they killed her because she was blackmailing them oh she

3513
04:05:10,700 --> 04:05:18,860
died because Simon wanted the position you know I I'm
totally fine with red herrings but now I'm just like it was

3514
04:05:18,860 --> 04:05:30,840
because you got the wrong girl because you that she was
cheating that you're that she was cheating with your husband

3515
04:05:30,840 --> 04:05:49,360
oh 96% is just a bug apparently oh okay cool Simon's laptop
who stole that the the storage room why were why were why

3516
04:05:49,360 --> 04:05:56,180
were OP opioids in the mirror room why did anything happen

3517
04:06:00,100 --> 04:06:00,740
Why?

3518
04:06:01,900 --> 04:06:02,440
Wow.

3519
04:06:03,460 --> 04:06:04,860
That was just crazy.

3520
04:06:05,700 --> 04:06:06,780
Well, um...

3521
04:06:07,340 --> 04:06:10,800
You had the insurance payout that allowed him to buy a car?

3522
04:06:11,780 --> 04:06:13,520
He abandoned his bike.

3523
04:06:20,060 --> 04:06:20,360
Wow.

3524
04:06:23,900 --> 04:06:27,920
If you missed Jenks' face, check out the shape-shifting
detective.

3525
04:06:28,160 --> 04:06:29,000
Oh, thank you.

3526
04:06:33,470 --> 04:06:34,790
It's so funny.

3527
04:06:36,170 --> 04:06:43,350
To be, if I remember correctly, the creator admitted he had
no idea how he could finish the story.

3528
04:06:49,170 --> 04:06:50,490
First time in a Minto thumbnail.

3529
04:06:50,750 --> 04:06:51,170
Thanks, boss.

3530
04:06:51,450 --> 04:06:51,810
Thank you!

3531
04:06:52,510 --> 04:06:53,570
Thank you so much!

3532
04:06:53,770 --> 04:06:54,570
I was so funny.

3533
04:06:54,870 --> 04:06:57,770
Love seeing you play wacky stuff like this in Mystery of the
Druids.

3534
04:06:57,930 --> 04:06:59,530
I love wacky stuff like this.

3535
04:06:59,890 --> 04:07:00,190
Truly.

3536
04:07:01,050 --> 04:07:02,910
But now, I'm going to bed.

3537
04:07:03,790 --> 04:07:06,210
And I'm going to just think about this.

3538
04:07:06,530 --> 04:07:08,190
I'm going to mull it over and just be like.

3539
04:07:09,870 --> 04:07:12,050
We are not getting this back this time.

3540
04:07:12,910 --> 04:07:14,650
This time that we spent on this.

3541
04:07:17,030 --> 04:07:18,630
Toriko, thank you so much for the pic.

3542
04:07:20,970 --> 04:07:22,290
Have you seen this before?

3543
04:07:22,510 --> 04:07:23,130
My bed.

3544
04:07:23,390 --> 04:07:24,630
I miss my bed.

3545
04:07:26,390 --> 04:07:27,210
Thank you.

3546
04:07:31,630 --> 04:07:32,750
This was so funny.

3547
04:07:35,990 --> 04:07:37,130
Thank you, everybody.

3548
04:07:37,890 --> 04:07:38,570
Have a good day.

3549
04:07:38,950 --> 04:07:39,690
Have a good night.

3550
04:07:40,110 --> 04:07:41,250
Have a good time zone.

3551
04:07:41,490 --> 04:07:43,090
I'll see you when I see you next.

3552
04:07:43,790 --> 04:07:44,230
Otsumito.

3553
04:07:46,290 --> 04:07:48,530
Props to all the actors because they did really well.

3554
04:07:48,630 --> 04:07:49,790
I think so too, yeah.

3555
04:07:54,230 --> 04:07:55,370
Actors did amazing.

3556
04:07:56,950 --> 04:07:57,870
It's just, yeah.

3557
04:07:58,750 --> 04:07:59,770
Otsumito, everybody.

3558
04:08:00,150 --> 04:08:01,090
Eat it a-sumito.

3559
04:08:01,190 --> 04:08:01,510
Bye-bye.

3560
04:08:01,910 --> 04:08:02,910
Good night, good night.

3561
04:08:03,270 --> 04:08:04,230
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

3562
04:08:04,370 --> 04:08:04,990
See you.

3563
04:08:05,310 --> 04:08:05,890
Bye-bye.

3564
04:08:11,270 --> 04:08:12,870
It's pitch blue out there.

3565
04:08:13,070 --> 04:08:14,210
I'll be safe, yeah.
