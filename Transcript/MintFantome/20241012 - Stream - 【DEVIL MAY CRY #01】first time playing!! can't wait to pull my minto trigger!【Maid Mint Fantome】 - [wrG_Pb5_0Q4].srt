1
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,080
Oh!

2
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,330
Welcome back to everybody's favorite game Devil May Cry 2!

3
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,670
Devil May Cry.

4
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,110
Well I said welcome back.

5
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,750
Welcome to...

6
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,730
Wait, did I say welcome back?

7
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,950
Or did I say welcome to... I don't know.

8
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,570
DMC 2!

9
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,110
You said welcome back.

10
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,950
Sorry, I'm so used to saying welcome back to a game.

11
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,810
It's been a while since we've started a new series, huh?

12
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,330
Anyway, welcome!

13
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,630
Master, Miss, to Devil May Cry!

14
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,290
Oh my gosh, so many people have been wanting me to play the series!

15
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:59,250
Since I'm finishing up some other series, such as Metal Gear Solid 3, Eternal Darkness we just beat.

16
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,150
I can finally start Devil May Cry.

17
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,590
Devil May Cry.

18
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,750
What does it say?

19
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,450
Really appreciate your positivity, patience, and willingness to engage with games as they are.

20
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,290
Warts and all.

21
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,050
It makes watching really enjoyable.

22
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,710
Thank you!

23
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,270
Oh my gosh, I really appreciate you saying that.

24
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,690
Truly.

25
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,830
Thank you!

26
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,290
Devil May Park on!

27
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,070
I'm actually quite nervous though about playing this series, you guys.

28
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,150
I didn't try to read too much of pre-chat because...

29
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,730
This is my first time playing.

30
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,330
I will be playing in release order.

31
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,630
If you don't know that about me by now...

32
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,250
I will be playing in release order.

33
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,110
But you guys made the game seem so difficult.

34
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,090
I'm kind of scared.

35
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,670
And will I be playing DMC2?

36
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,710
Yeah!

37
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,290
Yeah!

38
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,150
If you don't want me to play it, you can just skip those streams, I guess.

39
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,410
So, yeah, I do plan on playing the whole series.

40
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,790
I already bought 4 and 5, so...

41
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,190
Wait, was there anything else?

42
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,270
Hold on, let me check.

43
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,350
Wait, Devil May... Yeah, 4 and 5.

44
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,710
Yeah, yeah, I already bought them, so...

45
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,970
Paragon, paragon, paragon.

46
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,450
Yeah.

47
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,070
DMC Devil May Cry.

48
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,410
That's the one we're playing today.

49
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,150
No, I'm just kidding.

50
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,510
I tried making that joke earlier in chat.

51
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,050
Well, I don't really know anything about the series, but my friend was just like...

52
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,450
You should tell them you're playing DMC Devil May Cry.

53
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,270
And watch them laugh.

54
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,550
And I did, and nobody got it.

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,570
And I was like, wait, what's so funny about it?

56
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,530
And they were like, it's just a bad reboot, question mark, I guess?

57
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,870
It's the Revengeance, kinda.

58
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:00,530
Okay.

59
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,970
But, like, Dante... Because they were explaining it to me.

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,550
They were like, imagine... Imagine you were playing MGS2...

61
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,990
As Raiden, and Raiden was bad.

62
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,110
And I was like, huh?

63
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,050
I don't understand.

64
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,590
The gameplay was good, but the story sucks.

65
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,650
Keith, thanks for the 5 gifted.

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,550
Will we watch the anime together?

67
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,170
I don't know.

68
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,250
Does Metal Gear survive?

69
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,410
Oh, okay, okay.

70
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,430
Explain it to me, like I'm a Metal Gear fan.

71
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,770
That's how I need you guys to explain it.

72
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,070
Place your bets on how long will Mint last until easy mode is now selectable.

73
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,110
Look, look, look.

74
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,450
Okay, you can't expect me to...

75
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,730
Okay, you can't expect me...

76
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,550
Streamer goes into game.

77
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,410
First time ever playing.

78
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,150
Streamer is bad at game.

79
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,470
VTuber, why are you bad at game?

80
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,650
First time ever playing.

81
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,490
I cannot believe you activated easy mode, Streamer.

82
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,690
VTuber, you're so... VTuber is so bad at game.

83
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,250
VTuber immediately get easy mode now selectable.

84
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,490
Because VTuber has never played game before.

85
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:16,910
Ever!

86
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,110
Enter goal!

87
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,190
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

88
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,830
Thank you.

89
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,570
Mito, did you get my super?

90
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,790
Your super?

91
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,380
Easy mode?

92
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,440
TMC, what is my favorite game?

93
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,400
I will try not to backseat.

94
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,860
Good luck.

95
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,760
Thank you!

96
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,760
Thank you.

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,380
So, I will probably be bad at the game, you guys.

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,060
Heads up.

99
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,300
I will probably be...

100
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,540
It might be frustrating to some of you that are really experienced in the game.

101
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,280
I apologize in advance.

102
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,800
But...

103
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,520
You know...

104
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,540
Hopefully, I'll get better.

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,900
Hopefully, I'll get better.

106
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,740
You know, I would like to imagine I've developed a little bit as a gamer.

107
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,420
The first time I played Metal Gear Solid, some boss fights took me hours.

108
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,720
And then I had never touched the game again.

109
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,280
Like, Metal Gear Solid 3, I have not played in 2 years.

110
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,980
I played it for the first time 2 years ago and then I have not played it again since.

111
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,060
And then I was able to beat a boss that took me so long.

112
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,020
The first time, I was able to beat him first try.

113
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,800
I think I've gotten a little bit better as a gamer.

114
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,900
2 years is not that long.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,400
For playing a game, I think it's very long.

116
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,380
If you don't play an instrument in 2 years, you won't know how to play it, probably.

117
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,760
I think.

118
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,680
Right?

119
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,020
The developer of DMC gave a PowerPoint about all the things they wanted to change about Dante.

120
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,960
Imagine if someone said, Snake isn't a silly weirdo, he's a badass ladies man.

121
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,000
He's that too though.

122
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,740
Don't mind the frustration, everybody needs learning.

123
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, I think I have quite a bit of patience.

124
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,140
Usually.

125
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,520
Today I'm feeling a little off though.

126
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,760
You guys, I feel so terrible.

127
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,700
I feel so terrible.

128
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,060
I had to get some medicine for my cat.

129
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,180
He has a little thing.

130
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,360
He's had a thing on his arm for a while.

131
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,580
And the vet has never given him medicine for it.

132
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,880
But before it was kind of grown over.

133
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,540
It's like a... I don't want to call it a tumor.

134
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,780
But it's like a lesion on his arm, right?

135
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,920
And it was fine.

136
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,260
It was scabbed over for a while.

137
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,600
And then recently he bit it open again.

138
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,640
And so... Yeah, just a growth.

139
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,520
And so he's been biting at it.

140
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,060
And so I took him to the vet and they were like, okay, here's some medicine.

141
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,860
But he's gonna have to wear the cone of shame.

142
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,300
Actually, it's a donut.

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,960
It's a donut.

144
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,120
For a week at least.

145
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,640
Hopefully.

146
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
They said about a week.

147
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,920
And he's like... Oh my gosh, he's so dramatic about it.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,820
He's like... Now he's walking.

149
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,900
But it's so pathetic.

150
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
He'll like walk to places that he doesn't usually go to.

151
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,660
And he'll be like...

152
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I can't walk here because of this cone.

153
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,660
Well, it's a donut.

154
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,680
Thank you for the episode.

155
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,160
I can't wait to see how this VTuber gets motivated.

156
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,700
Thank you.

157
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,560
Yeah, he's being a real drama queen right now.

158
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,960
He's wearing his little donut.

159
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,740
And he'll like walk to a place and bump into it.

160
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,000
But he never walks there usually ever.

161
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,680
But he's like... Now that I have this donut on...

162
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,820
I can't go there even if...

163
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,680
I can't go there anymore.

164
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,940
He never went there before.

165
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,860
He's just being super drama about it.

166
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,480
And it's making me so sad.

167
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,000
What a stinky brat.

168
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,640
I know.

169
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,920
Yeah, today he wanted to go to that spot.

170
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,980
My freedom.

171
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,060
Yeah, he's being a little baby but it's making me so sad.

172
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,540
It's hurting my heart.

173
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,780
So...

174
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,140
Sword, gun, sword, royal, trick, gun, sword, trick, gun, royal guard.

175
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,880
That will maybe make sense to me in about an hour.

176
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,620
Recovering the voice by the way.

177
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,280
Are you ready for Vimeo?

178
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,020
I think so.

179
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,160
Actually my voice feels so much better.

180
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,340
No squeakies.

181
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,880
I think I'm all good.

182
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,280
Maybe.

183
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,500
But yeah.

184
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,240
Oh, that's CMC4.

185
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,720
Why would you trick me?

186
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,260
Okay, send that again in like...

187
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,820
3 games.

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,280
Send that in like 3 games.

189
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,420
You're a little early.

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,020
But you have the spirit.

191
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,140
I understand.

192
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,800
You're just excited.

193
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,740
I get it.

194
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,440
Okay.

195
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,380
Alright, villain.

196
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,080
I'll wait.

197
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,900
I'll wait.

198
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,460
You better be a member until DMC4, okay?

199
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,040
Would recommend starting with 3 if you want brain rot.

200
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,020
How about I play until 3 and I still get the brain rot?

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,420
How about that?

202
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,780
How about I...

203
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,480
You know, because what if you told me to start with MGS3 to get the brain rot?

204
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,310
I still would have gotten brain rot starting at 1.

205
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,070
Don't underestimate my brain rot.

206
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,390
I still have parts of my brain that are available that are healthy.

207
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,390
You know?

208
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,530
I still have parts of my brain that are healthy that need to be consumed.

209
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,890
Maybe.

210
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,930
You guys, I'm so happy.

211
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,690
I recently bought another...

212
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,190
This is gonna sound so bad.

213
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,890
I recently bought another case.

214
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,750
Like a display case.

215
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,210
Just for Metal Gear stuff.

216
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,270
Start with revengeance, my lord.

217
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,730
You can't have any one brain rot.

218
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,170
Ryan, welcome to my bootcamp.

219
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,210
Thank you!

220
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,790
Thank you, thank you.

221
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,630
So, I will have a display case just for Metal Gear stuff because I'm all out of room.

222
00:13:51,630 --> 00:14:03,010
In my current display case, right now, my Metal Gear stuff takes up 2 out of 4 of the display cabinet.

223
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,990
It's actually not even a case, it's a cabinet.

224
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,290
Oh gosh.

225
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,090
And then I have no more room for my doujins, which is a really big problem.

226
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,030
Because I have 2 shelves taken up on my bookshelf by Metal Gear stuff.

227
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,010
So, I need all my Metal Gear stuff.

228
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,810
Right now it's kind of all spread out across my cafe.

229
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,290
So I will be consolidating it all into one spot.

230
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,990
Have you had time to build any Rex models?

231
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,430
No.

232
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,290
It's still in the box.

233
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,490
I'm looking at it right now.

234
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,790
Still over there.

235
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,650
But once I get it all nice looking, I'll take a picture for you guys.

236
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,070
You guys can see.

237
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,270
Hopefully everything will fit.

238
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,410
There will be some things that are too big to fit, I think.

239
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,830
Such as the Rex model box, but you know.

240
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,470
Please forgive my member chat.

241
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,870
You don't have to read this.

242
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,270
Wait.

243
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,670
I didn't mean a fence.

244
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,050
Why?

245
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,670
What do you mean a fence?

246
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,210
No, no.

247
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,910
What are you talking about?

248
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,930
Everything is all good.

249
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,730
Don't worry about it.

250
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,490
I appreciate apologizing, but you are all good.

251
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,030
Don't worry.

252
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,190
I love you, Momito-chan.

253
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,410
I love you, Koyu-chan.

254
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,110
Thank you.

255
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,670
You unlock a lot more space when you store stuff 3 feet off the ground.

256
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,850
As a DMC veteran, welcome to the series.

257
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,010
Good luck and don't forget to have fun.

258
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,870
Thank you.

259
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,990
Yeah, I saw a lot of people saying that they are very excited about this.

260
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,050
And I saw some people saying that they don't know anything about the series.

261
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,530
So, a reminder.

262
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,990
I know nothing about the series.

263
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,490
I know Pull My Degr- Devil Trigger.

264
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,950
I combined Devil and Trigger.

265
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,210
Pull My Devil Trigger.

266
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,490
That's literally all I know.

267
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,670
And I know Dante is a guy.

268
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,930
I know Vergil is a guy.

269
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,390
So, no spoilers, please.

270
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,530
Happy face of spoilers?

271
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,110
Yes.

272
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:19,630
For those who don't know, if there are spoilers in the chat that I shouldn't be seeing, just post a smiley face.

273
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,930
A little emote or smiley face, whatever.

274
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,870
And that will be my cue to not look at chat.

275
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,570
So that I don't see anything that could spoil the story or whatever.

276
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,210
I know everybody gets very excited about these types of games and it's hard to resist.

277
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,590
Just imagine Supernatural but more edgy and dramatic.

278
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:44,950
Stop!

279
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,450
You are speaking my language.

280
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,290
I love Supernatural.

281
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,530
I loved Supernatural.

282
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,830
I actually didn't finish it because the series got a little wacky.

283
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,990
But also I just didn't have time to finish it.

284
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,530
I didn't have Netflix anymore, basically.

285
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,950
But, that's not wrong.

286
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,350
I heard this describer by another Vtuber as cool boys doing cool things.

287
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,110
It was accurate.

288
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,390
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

289
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,010
Okay, should we get started then?

290
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,210
Oh my gosh.

291
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,810
There will be plenty of DMC brain rot in this chat.

292
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,470
Okay, good.

293
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,770
Express all your brain rot.

294
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,770
I'll probably be playing too much to re-chat too much but...

295
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,570
Yeah, okay.

296
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,330
Let's go!

297
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,830
Oh, that was my controller disconnecting as I said let's go.

298
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,610
Wait, reconnect, reconnect, reconnect.

299
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,130
Connect.

300
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,050
It says continue but I haven't started it at all so let's just...

301
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,310
Yes?

302
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,500
This game contains scenes of explicit violence and gore.

303
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,160
Devil!

304
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,160
Devil!

305
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,040
Let's rock!

306
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,400
Wait,

307
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,190
what happened to it?

308
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,930
Why can't you see?

309
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,790
What happened to the game?

310
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,670
Give me a second.

311
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,300
What happened?

312
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,900
I think because it changed windows.

313
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,080
Windows.

314
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,040
Wait.

315
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,080
It launches a new window.

316
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,720
Yeah, I think that's what happened.

317
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,420
Sorry guys, you missed the whole intro.

318
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,980
I'm so sorry.

319
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,100
OBS, please.

320
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,380
OBS, please!

321
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,020
Hold on a second.

322
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,800
I think I might have to launch another game capture.

323
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,440
Let's see.

324
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,620
I got it.

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,140
We got it, we got it, we got it.

326
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,760
Okay.

327
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,830
Just a little bit of scope, sorry.

328
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,030
I think this is just... No spoilers, no spoilers, no spoilers.

329
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,150
Wait, how do I get out of this?

330
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,010
Oh there we go.

331
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,790
We can watch it again.

332
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,270
Warning, this game contains explicit gore and violence.

333
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,150
Let's rock!

334
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,700
Devil may cry.

335
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,720
Yippee, six months!

336
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,640
Thank you so much!

337
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,640
Thank you.

338
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,260
Alright, new game.

339
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,900
Oh my god.

340
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,840
Devil may cry.

341
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,160
This is the HD.

342
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,320
It's not original hardware, sorry.

343
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,920
Justice.

344
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,860
Sparda.

345
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,700
This is Sparda!

346
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,100
Why are you so quiet?

347
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,740
Turn up.

348
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,840
Sparda.

349
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,620
Where is Dante?

350
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,820
What about Dante?

351
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,580
Hot lady.

352
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,460
Oh my god, she is so Matrix coded.

353
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,900
Oh my god.

354
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,780
Devil may cry?

355
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:20,940
What?

356
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,940
It's a place?

357
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,540
Oh my god.

358
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,600
Oh my god!

359
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,980
My door!

360
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,200
No!

361
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,620
Hey babe.

362
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Oh my god.

363
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,220
You know, I couldn't be mad at her either.

364
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,820
Woah babe.

365
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,980
Are those my trophies?

366
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,580
Damn.

367
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,360
Dante-san.

368
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,600
My father... wait, my mother and my brother?

369
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,080
Woah!

370
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,440
Oh my god!

371
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,220
Roll credits, we're dead.

372
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,460
Oh my god.

373
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,700
We're dead.

374
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,820
Oh my god!

375
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,200
Sword.

376
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,600
Time to go to work guys.

377
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Yeah, sword.

378
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,480
That's so old school.

379
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,180
Yeah, fuck around and find out lady.

380
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,340
See?

381
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,080
She got lucky.

382
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,660
No bullets.

383
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,480
I think you threw a sword at me.

384
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,420
Hot.

385
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,180
Oh my god.

386
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,540
Oh my god.

387
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Mom?

388
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,460
Not my mom.

389
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,040
Are you my mommy?

390
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,780
So quietly.

391
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,740
Thank you.

392
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,000
Mallet Island.

393
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,150
Ok.

394
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,350
I'm constantly having to adjust the volume.

395
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,230
I'm so sorry guys.

396
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,600
How did we get here?

397
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
Take me with you!

398
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,800
This really sets the tone for the whole series.

399
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,780
Oh my god, time to play.

400
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,880
Wow, we can jump.

401
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,960
Ok, so Y is...

402
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,840
Alright, here we go baby.

403
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,680
Wait, where did the sword come from?

404
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,500
Where are my guns?

405
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,900
Oh there we go.

406
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,980
Wait, I'm taunting?

407
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,140
What is this?

408
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:14,880
Ok.

409
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,440
Unknown.

410
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm taunting?

411
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,520
Dante taunting.

412
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
Dante taunting.

413
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,940
Also thank you for the pink!

414
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,380
Someone sent me a pink super.

415
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,240
Thank you so much.

416
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,600
Sorry, a lot was going on.

417
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,900
I will read it.

418
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
I will read it later.

419
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,740
Can I go on top?

420
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,740
Alright, here we go.

421
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:36,860
Let's go.

422
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,930
Oh, what's this?

423
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,530
Oh my god.

424
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,230
You ready to make a devil cry?

425
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,450
Hell yeah!

426
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,310
Yellow orb.

427
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,950
A sacred stone that brings back life after death.

428
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:54,970
Ok.

429
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,650
Orb.

430
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,790
Pull my window trigger.

431
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,870
Oh gosh.

432
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,790
The way we run is a little special.

433
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:07,710
It's ok.

434
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,950
Go Dante, go.

435
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,870
Yorb.

436
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,850
Mission 1.

437
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,310
Curse of the bloody puppets.

438
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,490
Break the evil spell and open the cursed door.

439
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,270
Mission start.

440
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,250
Hello!

441
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,680
Oh these camera angles.

442
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,420
Ok, they are fixed camera angles.

443
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,800
Oh golly.

444
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,620
It's been a minute since I've done a game with fixed camera angles.

445
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,340
Ok, we got this.

446
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:46,940
It's fine.

447
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,880
I see Yorb?

448
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,640
No.

449
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,840
Rorb.

450
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,940
Red orb.

451
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,340
Red orb!

452
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,700
A red stone used to unlock new skills and doors.

453
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,200
Those are not the same thing.

454
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,400
Rorb.

455
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,420
To acquire new skills you must offer the stones to the god of time.

456
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,460
Pyro!

457
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,160
Thanks for the ticket.

458
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,820
Thank you.

459
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,060
Yeah, it does look kind of pink.

460
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,800
More than red, huh?

461
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,820
Oh, another Rorb.

462
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,140
Oh, just kidding.

463
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,840
Oh yes, not kidding.

464
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,580
I see another one up there.

465
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,740
Is that the god of time up there?

466
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,300
I'm gonna get all the orbs first.

467
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,700
Oh, I didn't even know there was one there.

468
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,500
I'm just that good.

469
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,820
Come on, Dante!

470
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,940
Slip!

471
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,540
No, I'm that good.

472
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm that good.

473
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,140
I'm so good at this game already.

474
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,560
Nevermind.

475
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,260
Thank you for the superchat!

476
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,700
Can I, can I like dodge?

477
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,500
Can I like do a little...

478
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,300
The music is kind of wild.

479
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,380
Mint orb equals morb.

480
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,300
You can roll.

481
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,980
Okay, we do have a map now.

482
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,480
How do I get to the other parts of the...

483
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,360
Like, how do I go to item and stuff?

484
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,140
Okay, I'll just... Maybe later.

485
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,220
Sword... The bumpers?

486
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,040
It wasn't working.

487
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,420
Bumpers aren't working.

488
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,860
D-pad!

489
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,040
Ah, no, that's moving the map around.

490
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,900
But also, this is also the...

491
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,740
Gotta unlock it.

492
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,380
Okay, okay.

493
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,660
That's what I thought.

494
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,200
How do I get over here?

495
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
What do I jump onto?

496
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,380
Maybe...

497
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,460
Oh, okay.

498
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,960
Let's go, let's go talk to the time god.

499
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,580
This is a Capcom game based on Resident Evil, so expect puzzles.

500
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,400
Didn't some people say this was supposed to be Resident Evil?

501
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,680
A Resident... Not Resident Evil 1, but A Resident Evil.

502
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:22,960
Hello?

503
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,740
RE4.

504
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,560
Oh, this statue must be the Watcher of Time.

505
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,040
This is... This god knows...

506
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,500
And remembers... Oh, god knows.

507
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,680
And remembers all of the past.

508
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,140
This god knows... Well, what about the future?

509
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,280
I know the past too, because I...

510
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,860
I was in the past.

511
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,620
Anybody can remember all the past.

512
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,200
You're not special.

513
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,560
The words of this god are engraved.

514
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Those who desire to acquire the ancient ways of war...

515
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,720
Shall offer the blood of monsters in exchange.

516
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,100
It's not responding.

517
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,520
I'd better unseal the door beneath here first!

518
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,820
Exclamation point.

519
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,200
Hope you enjoy the series.

520
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,980
Thank you!

521
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,180
Looking forward to the series.

522
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,760
Nice.

523
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm exploring around first.

524
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,440
This is how we get over here.

525
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,960
Can I jump on to Angel?

526
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,640
No.

527
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,860
Are there any hidden doors and things like that?

528
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,680
Farron, welcome to Mambooship.

529
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,880
Thank you so much!

530
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,810
What's up there?

531
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,880
OK.

532
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,780
It's really... Oh my god!

533
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,080
How did... What?

534
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,680
There we go.

535
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,320
I was gonna say, there's really just only this stuff in there and I think I've got just about...

536
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,240
I assume everything in this room.

537
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,420
I'm assuming I got everything.

538
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,940
Let's go.

539
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,120
Yeet leap.

540
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,220
I don't see anything else, you guys.

541
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,180
Oh, wait.

542
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,460
You're about to get absolutely annihilated, nerd.

543
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,620
What do you mean?

544
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,840
Oh, wait.

545
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,060
I see a blue over there.

546
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,360
Yeah, there's the blue orb.

547
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,700
I thought I saw it.

548
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,260
That's right.

549
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,880
Oh, I think we have to go to the top and then drop down.

550
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,380
Blue orb, blue orb, blue orb.

551
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,040
Down, down, down.

552
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,340
Down.

553
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,180
There's another door there too.

554
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,820
Blue orb, blue orb time, blue orb time.

555
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,580
What does the blue orb allow me to do?

556
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,040
Fixed camera angles always confuse me when it comes to...

557
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,040
If I jump down here...

558
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,420
Dante, why can't you like jump and grab?

559
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,540
Grab the ledge.

560
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,460
More health juice.

561
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,060
Spoilers!

562
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,300
I'm just kidding.

563
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,460
He's not a parkour man.

564
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,830
You can jump against walls.

565
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,270
You can?

566
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,450
Oh, shoot.

567
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,350
It's the most generic hitting sound ever.

568
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,570
I wish I could see.

569
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:18,950
Oh my gosh.

570
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,990
This is the stream.

571
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,810
Yeah, me trying to get the blue orb is the stream, guys.

572
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,450
I'm so sorry.

573
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,950
Oh my gosh.

574
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,000
Come on, Dante.

575
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,300
There's like some enemy just watching him be pathetic.

576
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,700
Okay.

577
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,680
Wait, what's his idle stuff?

578
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,300
What does he do?

579
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,280
I'mma tired.

580
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,160
Do something.

581
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,270
Dante is so cool.

582
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,350
He becomes Ocelot.

583
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,370
Maybe I give up.

584
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,990
I don't know.

585
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,410
Come on.

586
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,290
Okay, I give up.

587
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,830
Let's just go.

588
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,690
First I want to see what this door is over here.

589
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,330
The blue door.

590
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,170
Over here?

591
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,590
Where was the blue door?

592
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,170
I saw it.

593
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,680
Or maybe I'm crazy.

594
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,040
Right...oh, there.

595
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,280
This door is sealed shut.

596
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,720
A rusty key may help.

597
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,220
Okay.

598
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,140
Use 45...

599
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,320
45 of them?

600
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,700
This is an expensive door.

601
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,240
What the hell?

602
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,740
This door is so expensive.

603
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,440
What is that?

604
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,500
A heavy iron lattice gate is lowered.

605
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:14,600
It appears that this iron lattice gate will have to be raised in order to get out of this old castle.

606
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,620
That's great.

607
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,180
Lattice.

608
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,760
These transitions are gnarly.

609
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,900
Oh, what's this?

610
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,220
Oh my god.

611
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,940
I think it's a little breezy outside, you guys.

612
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,000
I can see the castle's garden from the window.

613
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,040
I think it's a little breezy.

614
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,860
No.

615
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,420
What's this way?

616
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,200
Okay.

617
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,920
It's a puppet that resembles the residents of this castle.

618
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,300
This chapter was called the Bloody Puppets, wasn't it?

619
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,120
Are they going to come to life?

620
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,400
No, I'm scared.

621
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,330
Let's go.

622
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,330
Rorb?

623
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,690
Rorb.

624
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,090
I don't know how to fight yet.

625
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,030
Yellow.

626
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,170
I got the rusty key!

627
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,110
The key is rusted, but it should work.

628
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,730
Don't do it.

629
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,990
I'm ready.

630
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,410
I'm ready for you.

631
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,310
I'm ready.

632
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,770
I wasn't ready.

633
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,850
Oh my god!

634
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,070
No, don't!

635
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,810
Oh my god.

636
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,370
Oh my gosh, not cool.

637
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,350
Can I use my guns?

638
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,310
How do I use my guns?

639
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,710
Oh.

640
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,640
X on Xbox controller.

641
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,680
Oh, okay.

642
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,940
Is that it?

643
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,400
Why is the combat music still going?

644
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,660
Oh, that's why.

645
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Wait.

646
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,860
How do I...

647
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,400
Sorry.

648
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,420
The X is not working, so...

649
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,680
Come here, this way.

650
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,500
Right button plus X.

651
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,240
Oh!

652
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:03,740
Okay.

653
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,660
Thank you guys.

654
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,200
We gotta aim with R1 first.

655
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,380
Understood.

656
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,720
I did it.

657
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,220
Are there bullets in this game?

658
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,250
No!

659
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,650
This game owns...

660
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,050
Yippee!

661
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,770
No reloading or anything?

662
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,250
Unlimited ammo.

663
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,010
There are three openings to insert something.

664
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,770
Any hole is a goal.

665
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,770
Get in there Dante.

666
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,490
The mouth is wide open.

667
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:54,980
Okay.

668
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,700
Oh, what's this?

669
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,420
There's a ladder, but the lid is closed and I can't go through.

670
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:00,900
Lucky.

671
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,660
You can taunt.

672
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:05,960
Oh!

673
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,900
Oh my gosh.

674
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,420
What if I leave?

675
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,120
Oh my gosh.

676
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:20,880
Oh my gosh.

677
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,180
Wait.

678
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,000
Camera angle.

679
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,760
Camera angle.

680
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,620
There's more?

681
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,740
There's more?

682
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,820
There's more?

683
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,240
There's...more?

684
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,360
Oh my gosh.

685
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,730
Oh my gosh.

686
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,130
There's more?

687
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,400
There's more upstairs.

688
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,900
I think.

689
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,480
What was the green orb?

690
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,540
The green orb is live.

691
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,120
Oh!

692
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,550
Missed the grorb.

693
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,230
It was...I didn't think it would disappear so fast.

694
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,750
Should I like go up there?

695
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,770
Oh my gosh.

696
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,850
Maybe he'll give me another grorb.

697
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,550
Grorb please!

698
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,470
What

699
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,380
am I hearing?

700
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,320
Where are they?

701
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm gonna leave.

702
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,040
There's so many of these guys.

703
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,940
They're just never ending.

704
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,220
Let's just leave.

705
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,630
Can you stop camping the doorway please?

706
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,020
I can't tell if I'm hitting anybody.

707
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,380
OK.

708
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,300
Next one please.

709
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,960
Oh grorb!

710
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,000
Grorb!

711
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,380
Grorb!

712
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,920
We're important!

713
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,180
Important!

714
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,840
A secret stone that revitalizes energy as soon as you get it.

715
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,500
Nice, nice.

716
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,180
Anybody else?

717
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,100
Oh, I think so.

718
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,440
I'm just gonna pretend that there is.

719
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,420
What?

720
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,620
I hear them everywhere.

721
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,180
Did I go through here before?

722
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,980
Or wait, this is where I came from.

723
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,420
Yeah.

724
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,120
We got the rusty key, so let's go.

725
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,160
They're in the walls.

726
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,220
Wait,

727
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,200
actually...

728
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,080
Birthday?

729
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,400
So happy minty...Vince...Vince playing one of my favorite games of all time.

730
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,260
I turned 30 yesterday.

731
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,420
Could I please get a happy birthday minto?

732
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:33,980
Sideswipe!

733
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,760
Happy birthday!

734
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,460
Happy birthday!

735
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:36,720
Yay!

736
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,400
I used the rusty key.

737
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,920
Let's go.

738
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,820
This guy looks suspicious.

739
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,460
Good.

740
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:04,170
If I attack first...

741
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:04,850
I see them.

742
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,370
I see them all.

743
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,280
Oh gosh.

744
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,120
Aim Dante, just look up.

745
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,140
Oh my gosh, gamers don't look up you guys.

746
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,480
No!

747
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,300
Dante look up!

748
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Dante look up!

749
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,380
There is something written.

750
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,380
The 17 puppets are my masters.

751
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,840
There will be no admission as long as my masters are here.

752
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,460
What the hell?

753
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,380
OK.

754
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,460
He is too cool to look up to anything.

755
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,240
OK, 17 puppets.

756
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,260
Are we gonna die?

757
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,540
Question, how do I save?

758
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,200
Oh, RV.

759
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,500
Current mission.

760
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,600
How do I save?

761
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,120
You don't?

762
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,600
Saving is per mission.

763
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,800
Save at the time statues.

764
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,810
You guys are such liars!

765
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,270
Oh, wait.

766
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,090
You guys are such liars!

767
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:29,550
You guys are such liars!

768
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,790
Does it do the thing where...

769
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:45,170
It looks like it starts you at the beginning of the chapter.

770
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,370
Is it one of those where it starts you at the beginning of the mission kind of dealio?

771
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,910
Oh, the music stopped.

772
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,330
I was gonna say, I don't think they like that very much.

773
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,450
Oh, we are gonna go on top of a plane.

774
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,950
Oh, blue.

775
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:08,410
Nice.

776
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,010
Blorb!

777
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,150
Let's get this party started.

778
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,070
Also known as the fragment of life.

779
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,290
But it's only one fourth of the whole piece.

780
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,570
When it becomes whole, it will have the power to increase the vitality's maximum.

781
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:26,850
Can I?

782
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,170
Dang it.

783
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:28,790
Come on Dante.

784
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,150
Dante, aim!

785
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,530
Wait, there is only three guys here.

786
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,750
17 my butt.

787
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,940
Come on.

788
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,710
Wait, look this way.

789
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,520
Can I go down any further?

790
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,240
Oh my god.

791
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,020
No, that's so impossible.

792
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,480
They are right there.

793
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,740
Can I slice them, dice them?

794
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,680
Can I slice off their little...

795
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:23,880
Come down.

796
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,630
I didn't even reach that one.

797
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,130
Alright, come on.

798
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,150
Guys, come down.

799
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,650
You can come down.

800
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,370
Oh.

801
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,790
What are you trying to do?

802
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,570
You missed.

803
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,330
What is this?

804
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,970
This emblem responds to my powers.

805
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,870
That's my power.

806
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,430
Devil arms.

807
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:08,550
Handgun.

808
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,190
Ebony and ivory.

809
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,430
Dante's handmade guns.

810
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,790
You can select your devil trigger item.

811
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,420
Use your sword.

812
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:30,900
Okay.

813
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,080
Alright, smarty pants.

814
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,400
Oh, I see.

815
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,080
It's lighting up.

816
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,200
Maybe you were on to something for real.

817
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:43,820
Oh.

818
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,740
It's a one way road.

819
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,640
Oh my gosh.

820
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,240
Oh shoot.

821
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,260
No, no, no.

822
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:12,660
Stay away.

823
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:12,900
Stay away.

824
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,180
Stay away.

825
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,380
Oh my gosh.

826
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:20,740
Stay away.

827
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,100
Stay away.

828
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,360
GORB!

829
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,700
GORB!

830
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,000
GORB!

831
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,480
GORB!

832
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:25,620
GORB!

833
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,080
GORB!

834
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:26,400
GORB!

835
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,080
Got it.

836
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,120
Oh, they are coming from all sides.

837
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,200
Okay, I love that.

838
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,280
I love that part.

839
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,720
I love that part.

840
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,180
Stay away from me!

841
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,670
Oh, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

842
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,010
Oh my gosh, how do I dodge?

843
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,310
Take that.

845
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:58,710
Take that.

846
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,290
I'll take that.

847
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,990
I'll take that.

848
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:02,590
Uh oh.

849
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:03,550
What does that mean?

850
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,730
Is it over here?

851
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,070
Did I grab everything?

852
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,390
I think so.

853
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:18,670
Okay.

854
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:20,770
R1A.

855
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,910
Oh, R1.

856
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:24,090
Sorry.

857
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,250
No.

858
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,540
Oh my gosh.

859
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:35,880
Turn around.

860
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,700
Turn around.

861
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,580
Chill

862
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:50,840
here.

863
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,520
Be safe.

864
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,260
Anybody?

865
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:56,290
Anybody?

866
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,630
That was close.

867
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:04,730
Nice.

868
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,950
Gun only run.

869
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,570
I used my sword like once.

870
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,150
Collect.

871
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,370
Collect little rorbs.

872
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:19,550
Rorb collector.

873
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,770
Perfect.

874
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,050
Is that it?

875
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,660
Rorbs.

876
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,160
125.

877
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,160
Okay.

878
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,760
Nice.

879
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,000
C!

880
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,700
C for cool.

881
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,580
C for...

882
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,780
Could you do that?

883
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,680
C for cute.

884
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,100
No.

885
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,780
Dante is cool.

886
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,440
He's not cute.

887
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,340
Clear!

888
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:08,760
Awesome.

889
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:10,980
Alright.

890
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,740
Next mission.

891
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,900
So this is how the whole thing... How many missions are there then?

892
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,120
Open the door of the cathedral.

893
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,680
Wait.

894
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,380
Power up.

895
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,280
You can acquire health, magic and other enhancement items.

896
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,720
Devil star.

897
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,960
I was hoping everything would be called devil something.

898
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,940
20-ish missions?

899
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,420
Okay.

900
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,210
A rare stone that vitalizes.

901
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,950
I see their costs.

902
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:47,930
Wait, this one is free.

903
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:48,770
Maybe?

904
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,590
5 devil trigger gauges.

905
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,490
Wait, what does that mean?

906
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,990
Permanent upgrades to your character are almost always better than consumables.

907
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,010
So like this... Wait.

908
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,590
So these are considered consumables.

909
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,370
And are these... Wait.

910
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,110
No, that's a consumable too.

911
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,360
Holds power to eliminate all evil that's around you.

912
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,320
Woah.

913
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,480
Blorb and porb are upgrades.

914
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,260
Increase the maximum number of your devil trigger gauges.

915
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,720
So... Wait, can I buy this?

916
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,220
No.

917
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,620
I can't apparently buy anything.

918
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,340
That's okay.

919
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,400
That's fine.

920
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,180
Judge of death.

921
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,360
Oh, okay.

922
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,700
Oh my

923
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,700
god.

924
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,200
Behind me!

925
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:10,620
Behind me!

926
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:10,980
Behind me!

927
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,400
Behind me!

928
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,560
There you are.

929
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,500
I hear them.

930
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,200
I hear them in the walls.

931
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,920
Oh my god, they sound sick.

932
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,200
Hello?

933
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,100
Oh, there they are.

934
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:52,970
Ouch!

935
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,130
Oh my gosh.

936
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:55,490
Oh my gosh.

937
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:55,970
Oh my gosh.

938
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,230
Holy cow!

939
00:53:58,850 --> 00:53:59,810
Oh my god.

940
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:00,510
I'm gonna die.

941
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,330
I'm gonna die for real.

942
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,450
I'm gonna die for real.

943
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,650
Wait, can I get a gorb, please?

944
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,750
Can I get a gorb, please?

945
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:13,990
No?

946
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:15,010
Rude!

947
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,670
Rude!

948
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:15,990
Rude!

949
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:16,470
Rude!

950
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:16,630
Rude!

951
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:16,810
Rude!

952
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:17,010
Rude!

953
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:19,710
I died.

954
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,000
Wait, what do you mean only... Wait, what do you mean four yellow orbs?

955
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Wait, what do you mean by that?

956
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:36,630
What do you mean by that?

957
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,680
If I run out...

958
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,060
Oh my god, wait.

959
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,500
Hold on.

960
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,760
Please, I was not ready.

961
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,700
Please, I was not ready.

962
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,180
Please, I was not ready.

963
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,360
I was not ready!

964
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,420
I was not ready!

965
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,660
Oh, this guy is here.

966
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,840
I'm gonna go in here.

967
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,240
Nice.

968
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,320
Oh, hello.

969
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,020
Okay, I can do power-ups here and stuff.

970
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:29,480
Interesting.

971
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:29,900
Okay.

972
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,660
Oh, my bad.

973
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:41,480
Many of the books are records of the past civil court hearings and the rest are records of the harvest and births.

974
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,100
Books!

975
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,520
Is this a door?

976
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:54,940
No.

977
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,100
Can I destroy this?

978
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:57,860
No.

979
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,220
What can I destroy?

980
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,680
Let's go.

981
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,280
I hate furniture.

982
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,920
I can't destroy the books though.

983
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,620
We cannot destroy the books, those are...

984
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,740
They come back!

985
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,340
They come back!

986
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:32,900
They come back!

987
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,540
They come back.

988
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:34,740
Understandable.

989
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,580
Understandable.

990
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,080
They come back.

991
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:39,960
I got it.

992
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,480
I learned.

993
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,480
Get him first.

994
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,140
Get him while he's down, Dante.

995
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,360
That's just called being smart.

996
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,700
Being preemptive.

997
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,000
You know, you get the first attack on them and everything.

998
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:58,900
Okay.

999
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,820
Oh gosh, you guys.

1000
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,280
I don't wanna die again.

1001
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,220
I'm scared of them launching at me like they did before!

1002
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:21,950
Maybe we're in a better spot now.

1003
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,510
Okay.

1004
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,310
What changed?

1005
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,810
What changed?

1006
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,590
Dante is not smart, he's cool.

1007
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,850
Yeah, it's not cool to be smart.

1008
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:36,470
What's this?

1009
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,430
There's a painting of a middle-aged man.

1010
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,350
Riveting.

1011
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,510
That is not a middle-aged man!

1012
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,750
I know my head is kind of blocking it, but like...

1013
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:52,410
What?

1014
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,830
That is not... that's not a middle-aged man.

1015
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,130
Okay.

1016
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,430
I don't wanna go in there quite yet.

1017
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:02,350
I do wanna go up a little bit.

1018
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,350
Oh, this looks...

1019
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,130
Well, the other door looks way more official.

1020
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:07,410
What's this?

1021
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:12,250
There's a sculpture of a female in agony with a sword pierced through her chest.

1022
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,090
Wait, I can hear a voice.

1023
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,330
I am Alistair.

1024
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:21,310
The weak shall give their heart and swear their eternal loyalty to me.

1025
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,380
Am I dead?

1026
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:39,920
No.

1027
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:40,500
Twitchy.

1028
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,600
Why does this keep happening to me?

1029
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,620
Oh my god.

1030
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,120
Oh...

1031
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,900
But how did you... wait.

1032
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,520
That would like go through your face Dante.

1033
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,580
This isn't even my sword.

1034
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,900
I have the power!

1035
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,560
Oh my god.

1036
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,840
He's not even doing this for anyone.

1037
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,660
Just himself.

1038
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,520
Alistair gives the possessor lightning speed and aerial capabilities!

1039
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,220
I'm interested in how his jacket is holding up, right?

1040
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,240
Wait, so can I...

1041
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,300
Weapon.

1042
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:06,190
Wait.

1043
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,130
Oh, hold on.

1044
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,020
Oh, there we go.

1045
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,360
There we go.

1046
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,940
Oh, it's already... OK, it's already equipped.

1047
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,940
OK, just kidding.

1048
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,180
Pizza Man Adventures.

1049
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,020
And also, wait, what is the blue... there's like little blue barks.

1050
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,440
Pizza Man Adventures.

1051
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,620
Thanks!

1052
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,000
I don't understand...

1053
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:45,000
I don't understand yet, but maybe I'll understand.

1054
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,600
This door is locked... oh, wait.

1055
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,280
Looks like a rusty key.

1056
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:48,520
OK.

1057
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,260
One combo I like with sword is Y-Y-Delay-Y-Y-Y.

1058
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,200
Oh, thanks, I'll try.

1059
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,440
TMC was a prototype branch for RE4.

1060
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,400
Dante is basically Leon.

1061
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:20,180
I can see... I can feel how this is Resident Evil, you know.

1062
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:26,060
Obviously, just because of the camera angles alone make it very Resident Evil.

1063
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:29,900
OK.

1064
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,600
I hate Mother Nature.

1065
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,640
ViviCorn, thanks for the gifted!

1066
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,800
Why do you keep changing your profile picture like every two days?

1067
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,120
I don't recognize you anymore.

1068
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,520
What's this?

1069
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,920
Can I power up?

1070
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,660
Like, if I hold it?

1071
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:46,940
No.

1072
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,900
Uhm...

1073
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,340
OK...

1074
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,580
OK...

1075
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,800
What's over here?

1076
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:01,680
Watson?

1077
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,000
Albin!

1078
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,360
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

1079
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:04,900
Thank you!

1080
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,560
Oh, what's that?

1081
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:06,760
What's this?

1082
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,840
How do I grab...

1083
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,380
A shotgun!

1084
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:14,740
OK...

1085
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,920
Wait, what if I shoot it with the shotgun?

1086
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,500
Oh, sorry.

1087
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:36,040
I keep pressing B because, like, I'm so used to...

1088
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,820
JP games where...

1089
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,100
B is...

1090
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,760
Like, well, rather it's circle.

1091
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,140
And so it's like...

1092
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:45,660
Select.

1093
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:46,500
Equip?

1094
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,000
Yes.

1095
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:54,570
Nothing.

1096
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,030
How fast...

1097
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,050
Oh my god!

1098
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,390
OK, so...

1099
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:01,850
How was I able to shoot?

1100
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,150
Sorry, I'm just testing it right now.

1101
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,030
OK.

1102
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,470
It's pretty fast!

1103
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,710
It's actually really fast!

1104
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,190
Way faster than I thought.

1105
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,510
Man, I love Minto!

1106
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,350
Nisox, thank you!

1107
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:17,330
Thanks for 6 months!

1108
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,930
Oh my gosh, it really has been half a year.

1109
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,630
Try holding the fire button.

1110
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:25,770
Oh!

1111
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,530
For shotgun.

1112
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:37,150
Oh,

1113
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,620
I think I'm stupid.

1114
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,600
Mako, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1115
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:49,860
Thank you so much!

1116
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,860
Grim Reaper like devil is depicted.

1117
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,600
The key is embedded.

1118
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,100
Should I take it?

1119
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:54,540
Yes.

1120
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:58,920
Rest the key.

1121
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,860
Alright, prepare to be ambushed.

1122
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,000
Ambush?

1123
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,600
DMC1 is rough but fun.

1124
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,360
All good!

1125
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,840
Thank you though.

1126
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:21,360
At least I'm not so inexperienced with older games, you know?

1127
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,980
Especially older... I don't want to say janky games, but like, you know what I mean.

1128
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,240
Alright, here we go.

1129
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:30,980
Oh!

1130
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,620
Yeah,

1131
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,550
you're gonna... you're gonna hurt me.

1132
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:53,410
You're gonna come at me now?

1133
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:57,730
Chill out!

1134
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,170
Chill out!

1135
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:58,650
Chill out!

1136
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:05,290
Oh my god!

1137
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:05,850
No!

1138
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,590
They're coming from the walls!

1139
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,240
That's right!

1140
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,380
Oh my gosh, how did I dodge that?

1141
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:20,860
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1142
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,300
Yeah, yeah!

1143
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,100
Grab their... grab their Orbeez.

1144
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,260
Oh my gosh.

1145
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,100
I don't even know who I'm hitting!

1146
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,380
Everybody's dead!

1147
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,220
Everybody dies!

1148
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,100
Everybody dies!

1149
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,640
Are these eternal?

1150
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,700
Do these ever stop?

1151
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,160
Please!

1152
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,280
Give me a rest!

1153
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,900
Give me a rest!

1154
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,680
Dante is tired!

1155
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,900
They never die, real.

1156
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,560
Just keep blasting.

1157
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,520
Anyway...

1158
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,540
These guys

1159
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:24,900
are crazy!

1160
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,160
They take forever.

1161
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,540
Oh, we lived!

1162
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,380
Let's go!

1163
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,060
Press LB?

1164
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,160
Oh, what's that do?

1165
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,420
Shotgun!

1166
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:33,820
Paragon!

1167
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,180
Paragon!

1168
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:34,560
Shotgun!

1169
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:34,920
Shotgun!

1170
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:35,320
Paragon!

1171
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,700
I just blasted.

1172
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:47,060
Sorry guys, you might be like shouting things at me, but I'm not looking at chat, so...

1173
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,220
I'm playing a game.

1174
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:48,680
Sorry.

1175
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,540
Where's the key?

1176
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,340
Busy room.

1177
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,660
Oh my gosh.

1178
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,200
Oh,

1179
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,730
sometimes they stay away, sometimes they don't.

1180
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:21,490
Oh my gosh.

1181
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:29,250
Oh my gosh, cinematic.

1182
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,130
This angle is so...

1183
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,310
This angle is so cinematic.

1184
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,790
Oh my gosh, I did the wrong thing.

1185
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,650
Stop shooting me!

1186
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:41,230
I mean...

1187
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,560
Wow, nice parry.

1188
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,000
Let's go.

1189
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,340
I like combining them, you know?

1190
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,940
To keep them away from me.

1191
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:24,460
Die!

1192
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:24,840
Die!

1193
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:25,280
Die!

1194
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:56,120
Is the devil trigger what I just did?

1195
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,060
Is the devil trigger what I just did?

1196
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,800
Did I just pull my devil trigger?

1197
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:07,870
Let's go!

1198
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,390
Is that...oh, hold on.

1199
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,550
Wait, will it show up?

1200
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:18,390
I was hoping it would show up if I...the little blue things on the...

1201
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:22,410
Or is that the blue orbs that I'm picking up?

1202
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,090
When it shows my health bar, you know?

1203
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:29,170
It's mana.

1204
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,250
Oh, ok, ok, ok.

1205
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:35,050
Nice.

1206
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,910
Let's see what we got around here.

1207
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:38,990
Charge is up in 5.

1208
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,490
Oh, come on.

1209
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:45,610
Go away.

1210
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,630
It's a statue of an angel.

1211
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,690
The guardian of a god.

1212
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,360
What's this?

1213
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,460
It's an engraving of a lion.

1214
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,460
There's something written.

1215
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:08,320
Only those who the lion has accepted can set me free.

1216
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,400
That's my best lion roar.

1217
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,900
Do you accept me, lion?

1218
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,460
The yeet jump is so funny.

1219
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:25,940
What is here?

1220
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,300
Oh my

1221
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,200
god, there's so many guys!

1222
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,360
Where is swordsman?

1223
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,320
Where is swordsman real?

1224
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,180
What the hell is this?

1225
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:08,380
Stylish.

1226
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,620
Great job, Minto.

1227
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,440
Thank you!

1228
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,780
I swallowed my drink wrong.

1229
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,420
There's something written.

1230
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,020
A god stands before thee.

1231
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,740
It's me, Minto.

1232
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,280
To open the path, use thy strength to drive it back.

1233
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,350
I am the god.

1234
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:52,570
Wait, I'm trying to attack this angel.

1235
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,570
There's gotta be something in there.

1236
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,990
She's beginning to believe.

1237
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:58,870
I'm starting to get it, I think.

1238
01:11:58,910 --> 01:11:59,410
I hope.

1239
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,670
There's something engraved beneath the opening.

1240
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:04,570
This is where the guiding souls gather.

1241
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:09,330
Like, I have no idea what's going on, but I'm enjoying myself.

1242
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:15,010
Oh my gosh, I really swallowed that wrong.

1243
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,670
Do I go through here or do I go back to the lion?

1244
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,630
Let's go through here.

1245
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,610
Staff of Judgment.

1246
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:33,990
A staff that shines with mysterious light.

1247
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,720
I have to not get crushed.

1248
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,160
Nevermind.

1249
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,900
He's judging me, you guys.

1250
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,060
Wait, is it a weapon?

1251
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:51,620
No.

1252
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,040
Memento of Dante's mother.

1253
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:58,500
In the back is an engraving, Virgil and Dante!

1254
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,220
Is Virgil my brother?

1255
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,940
The nostalgia of seeing this game again reminds me of why I love this game so much.

1256
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,840
This game always holds a special place in my heart.

1257
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,500
Wait, what's the vital star?

1258
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,180
Oh, this is the revitalizer.

1259
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:14,440
Oh.

1260
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,160
No, no, no.

1261
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,060
I don't need it.

1262
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,100
I don't need it.

1263
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,380
Oh!

1264
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,340
We ended up back here!

1265
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,840
Wait, how did I get to the...

1266
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,180
To the pool.

1267
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:32,800
Was it here?

1268
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,440
What the?

1269
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,860
What is this?

1270
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,300
Huh?

1271
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:57,660
Oh!

1272
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,540
This is like Dementors!

1273
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,020
What's going on?

1274
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:01,680
Oh?

1275
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,220
Oh my god.

1276
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,520
Oh, they...avoid...

1277
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,520
Oh my god.

1278
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1279
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:19,820
Oh my god.

1280
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:21,380
I

1281
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:37,490
don't think we're good.

1282
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:38,490
Oh wait, maybe we are good.

1283
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,110
Oh, we're good!

1284
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:40,990
Okay!

1285
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,110
Anyway...

1286
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,050
Is there anyone else up here?

1287
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:51,750
Am I crazy?

1288
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,500
Did I know those ghosts?

1289
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,500
Just because I'm a ghost doesn't mean I know every ghost.

1290
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,520
Her sword is a tool of judgment.

1291
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,260
Wait, what?

1292
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,100
Oh my god.

1293
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:13,680
Crash!

1294
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:15,600
Wait, am I going the wrong way?

1295
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,020
I can't remember which way...

1296
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:18,400
Nice.

1297
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,720
A raid of spiders!

1298
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,380
Oh no, we went through this door down here.

1299
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,040
Here.

1300
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:25,460
Yes.

1301
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1302
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,060
Now I have the judgment thing, so the...

1303
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,100
Oh gosh.

1304
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,460
If I could reach, that would be awesome.

1305
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:57,760
Oh my god.

1306
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:58,680
Ouchie, ouch, ouch.

1307
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,120
Kill that guy.

1308
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,600
He attacked me and hurt me.

1309
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:03,720
You hurt me good.

1310
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,620
Get the corp.

1311
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,860
Keep my distance.

1312
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,020
I guess this would be a good time to use this, huh?

1313
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,940
Yeah, yeah.

1314
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:57,570
I did it.

1315
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,080
Oh, worm.

1316
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,580
Okay, so what's this guy over here?

1317
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,420
It's a statue of an angel.

1318
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,100
Oh, a guardian of God.

1319
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,040
Maybe I bring the judgment... Okay, lion.

1320
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,100
Come judge me.

1321
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,460
Ouch!

1322
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,700
Okay, just kidding.

1323
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,220
There's an immense power that will not allow anyone to get closer.

1324
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,760
Before I can confront the lion, I'll need a sign.

1325
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,180
A sign?

1326
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:53,830
Give me a sign.

1327
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,650
God, are you there?

1328
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,090
God, give me a sign.

1329
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,010
Oh, come on.

1330
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:06,450
So if you're just hanging out in an area for too long, the guys will come out?

1331
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:21,590
What do I do here, though?

1332
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:29,700
That was so intense.

1333
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,680
I'm trying to destroy the fountain.

1334
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,800
Won't let me, though.

1335
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,280
I just went... Oh wait, there was a hole.

1336
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,520
Hold on, there was like more stuff.

1337
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,540
There was more stuff in the other room.

1338
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,300
I just didn't go to it.

1339
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,820
I don't think I can go from there.

1340
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,620
I think I have to go around.

1341
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,040
Dante, best boy.

1342
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,320
Stay away from me.

1343
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:18,480
You freak.

1344
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,900
Stay away from me, you freaks.

1345
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:23,920
You freaks.

1346
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,560
Stay away.

1347
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:26,700
Oh my gosh.

1348
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,800
Too many of you guys.

1349
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,020
I don't want to deal with you.

1350
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,260
Leave me alone.

1351
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,140
Leave me alone.

1352
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,740
Devil trigger time.

1353
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:46,020
So this thing is where all the souls gather.

1354
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,700
Whatever that means.

1355
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,080
Uh...

1356
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,440
I whack it.

1357
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,660
Okay, nevermind.

1358
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,980
This is where we went down.

1359
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,760
There were no other doors, right?

1360
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:07,160
No?

1361
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,260
Go back to where you got the sword, Minto.

1362
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,820
Where was...

1363
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,760
Oh, I know where that was.

1364
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,380
Go back to where I got the sword.

1365
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:23,660
Okay.

1366
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:24,840
I'll go.

1367
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:27,880
Oh

1368
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:32,680
my god.

1369
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,400
Oh my god.

1370
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,160
I didn't even see this guy here.

1371
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,660
Holy moly.

1372
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,460
Oh my gosh.

1373
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,100
I didn't even see them here.

1374
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:58,690
That's right.

1375
01:20:58,850 --> 01:20:59,670
That's right.

1376
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:01,970
That's right.

1377
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:19,550
I can't see.

1378
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:20,130
Go away.

1379
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,170
Get out of my face.

1380
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,950
Give me some space.

1381
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:28,750
The social distancing.

1382
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,440
Oh my gosh.

1383
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,620
How did I...

1384
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:40,670
Out, out, out, out.

1385
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,940
Out, out, out, out.

1386
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,060
Out, out, out, out.

1387
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,560
Out.

1388
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:00,390
I tried to shoot him, but I didn't get to...

1389
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,330
Restore, restore.

1390
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:04,690
Restore, restore, restore.

1391
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:07,010
Restore, restore, restore.

1392
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:11,510
There are so many guys.

1393
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:15,750
Okay, so here.

1394
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:31,210
Anyway, I started blasting.

1395
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,570
Anyway, I started blasting.

1396
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:39,950
Take that.

1397
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:45,950
The wall.

1398
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,550
So here.

1399
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,510
This is where I died.

1400
01:22:58,410 --> 01:22:59,210
Give me a sign.

1401
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:03,930
Down this way?

1402
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:10,590
There is another door down here.

1403
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:11,370
Was there?

1404
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,000
Did I go down here?

1405
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,380
Oh my gosh.

1406
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:28,970
And...

1407
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:34,450
And...

1408
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:37,570
And...

1409
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:46,510
Stupid wall ghost.

1410
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,990
This makes me want to get some scissors though.

1411
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,210
It's kind of cool.

1412
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:53,730
I like it.

1413
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,330
It's a good image, I think.

1414
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:57,930
What is this?

1415
01:23:58,570 --> 01:23:59,450
Oh, oh wait.

1416
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,150
It's a landscape painting.

1417
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:04,670
Oh, there is an Iris Aura surrounding it.

1418
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:06,070
I remember.

1419
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:07,830
Is there another guy?

1420
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,400
Oh, there is two of them.

1421
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,300
Ah!

1422
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,180
I wish I could use my sword on them, but...

1423
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:27,780
Oh my gosh.

1424
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,380
Yeah, take that and...

1425
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,540
There is three of them!

1426
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,280
There is three of them.

1427
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,860
Take that wall.

1428
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:44,120
If I blow up the wall enough, he can't hide in there, you know?

1429
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:51,060
You can use the sword after the shot, I guess?

1430
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:54,060
But he is like in the wall, so...

1431
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:00,110
It's all good.

1432
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:07,560
Is there another one?

1433
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,260
Oh my god.

1434
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,300
Leave me alone!

1435
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,340
You can combo your weapons together.

1436
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,160
Okay, hold on.

1437
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:15,760
Let me try it.

1438
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,380
Oh my gosh!

1439
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,520
He dodged it though.

1440
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:28,940
Am I just bad?

1441
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,000
Am I just bad?

1442
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,020
Oh my god, go away!

1443
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,740
Wait, this door...

1444
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,420
Led to...

1445
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,800
This room.

1446
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:59,880
I don't...Wait, can I get a hint?

1447
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:00,860
What am I supposed to do?

1448
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,440
I got that staff.

1449
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,540
Go back to where you got Alistair.

1450
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,720
I was literally just there!

1451
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,140
Was I not in the right place?

1452
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,400
Spider wall is a door.

1453
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,540
Oh my god.

1454
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,040
No.

1455
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,800
No, please.

1456
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,080
Please.

1457
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,960
Please don't let me die.

1458
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,160
I don't wanna die yet.

1459
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,180
Please.

1460
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,800
Oh my god.

1461
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,880
Everybody is back.

1462
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,400
Everybody is here.

1463
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,220
Everybody is here.

1464
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,420
Spider wall is a door now.

1465
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,140
Was it not a door before?

1466
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,800
Wait, the door I went through.

1467
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,440
Farming orbs.

1468
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,940
Wait, so we went through that obviously.

1469
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:02,060
This was always a door.

1470
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,160
There's...

1471
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,620
Interact with the white wall.

1472
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,320
This wall?

1473
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,460
This wall.

1474
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,000
It's a carving of the judge of death.

1475
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,660
Is he gonna judge me?

1476
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,040
It looks like the judge should be holding something.

1477
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:23,200
I saw Charlotte use the staff of judgment.

1478
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:23,940
Yes.

1479
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:27,920
I see.

1480
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,520
That was mission clear the whole time!

1481
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,020
Same.

1482
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,520
The spiders were supposed to lead you there.

1483
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,360
I was just like squish squash.

1484
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:54,260
Nice.

1485
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,140
Clear.

1486
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,280
Oh, no.

1487
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,810
Oh, easy automatic...

1488
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:09,790
I only died once.

1489
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,070
What are you talking about game?

1490
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:16,850
It's because I took too long.

1491
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:17,930
I was farming.

1492
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:19,030
What are you talking about?

1493
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:19,130
Wow.

1494
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:27,470
In this mode you'll be able to perform and enjoy...

1495
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:28,790
You can't blame me.

1496
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,510
I was so focused on the lion.

1497
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,820
With just one button you'll be able to perform many different sword actions.

1498
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,120
It sounds awesome though.

1499
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:41,520
No.

1500
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:46,660
Overcome the trial and acquire the pride of lion.

1501
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:49,720
Now we're on to the lion, guys.

1502
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,700
We're finally there.

1503
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:01,930
Stinger level 1.

1504
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:04,450
With lightning speed, plunge the sword into enemies.

1505
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:08,030
We can do this one.

1506
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:11,890
Become airborne and be capable of performing aerial electrocution attacks.

1507
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:15,050
I can afford it.

1508
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:18,170
But I can only get stinger or air raid.

1509
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:22,670
We love stinger.

1510
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,650
Always get stinger.

1511
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,260
Stinger is broken.

1512
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,040
Stinger is OP.

1513
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,180
Okay.

1514
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,960
I'll trust you guys.

1515
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,900
Plunge the sword from an even further distance.

1516
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,440
What other extra stuff can I get?

1517
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,180
I can get blue orb.

1518
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,840
I can't get purple orb.

1519
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,320
I can get blue orb though.

1520
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:54,220
I'm going to get it.

1521
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:58,820
See?

1522
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,100
It was so worth it.

1523
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,600
We wouldn't have been able to get both stuff, you guys.

1524
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:05,160
Gosh.

1525
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:09,040
That's why I farmed.

1526
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,980
Stinger, my beloved.

1527
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,780
What's wrong with this?

1528
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,100
Is it me?

1529
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,720
Or does that thing up there look kind of sexy?

1530
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,420
It looks like... Okay, you see?

1531
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,840
It looks like it's a lady being like...

1532
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,120
And her legs are kind of like...

1533
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,600
They're crossed in front of each other and her arms are out.

1534
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:45,180
The walls are sexy.

1535
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:02,960
The pride of lion is granted only to those who choose the path of trials.

1536
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,660
It was a trial to get here so I think I deserve this.

1537
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,560
I think I've earned this.

1538
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:11,960
Thank you.

1539
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:19,160
Can the wall attack me with the hand?

1540
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,420
It was a trial to get here.

1541
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,200
Please, lion.

1542
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:30,230
Oh my gosh.

1543
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:30,410
See?

1544
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:31,590
It's so sexy though.

1545
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,750
It's not just me, right?

1546
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:37,650
You guys see it too, right?

1547
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,800
What's this?

1548
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,240
This symbol resembles the staff of Hermes.

1549
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,620
It's used in the art of alchemy.

1550
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:05,160
I can feel some kind of mysterious force but I just can't quite understand it.

1551
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,320
The walls are sexy.

1552
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,240
Mito, true enjoyer of architecture.

1553
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,700
It is super just you, chief.

1554
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,180
No, no, no, no.

1555
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,560
I know it's not just me.

1556
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:22,420
It states go back the path and thou shalt return from the abyss.

1557
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,560
With thy lion heart and thou shalt receive the pride of lion.

1558
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:29,760
Ok.

1559
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,060
Wait, the path?

1560
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:33,300
This way?

1561
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:39,260
I don't think so.

1562
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,800
The music just looped.

1563
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,180
Can I not jump into this?

1564
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,500
It looks like a portal.

1565
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,480
Ok, I'm going back.

1566
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:54,240
Easiest trial ever!

1567
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,520
What the hell is this?

1568
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,460
Skellies!

1569
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,740
Happy Halloween!

1570
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,840
Happy Halloween!

1571
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,460
Happy Halloween!

1572
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,560
My health.

1573
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:51,310
Use stinger?

1574
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:52,030
I just got it.

1575
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:52,750
How do I use it?

1576
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:57,390
Nice.

1577
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,630
I'll take that.

1578
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,310
I love how people are like...

1579
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:08,070
Hey Vtuber, do this thing when there is literally no tutorial on how to do anything in this game.

1580
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:10,970
It didn't even teach me how to shoot.

1581
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:16,770
Do you know fighting game inputs?

1582
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:18,050
No!

1583
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,400
Sign of the strong.

1584
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,240
It allows confrontation with the lion gatekeeper.

1585
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:36,440
Alright.

1586
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:38,820
Sword,

1587
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:42,480
what's wrong?

1588
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,600
Are you not happy with...

1589
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,500
That's a big old spider.

1590
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:47,000
Oh boy.

1591
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,500
Spider time.

1592
01:35:55,410 --> 01:35:57,290
Brain of spider!

1593
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:09,790
What a big surprise.

1594
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:14,310
I hope for your sake you got something inside that big body of yours.

1595
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:26,530
Oh gosh.

1596
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:27,270
Oh my gosh.

1597
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:28,370
Wait, he's like a spider.

1598
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:30,990
Oh my god.

1599
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:31,330
Okay.

1600
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:32,330
Got it.

1601
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:35,150
Wait, so it was...

1602
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:36,730
Oh

1603
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:46,790
gosh.

1604
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:48,010
I don't want to get close to him.

1605
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:49,570
And I can't see anything.

1606
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:50,050
Okay.

1607
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:51,330
That's really cool.

1608
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:57,810
Oh, there is a dodge!

1609
01:36:58,290 --> 01:36:59,070
Oh my god.

1610
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:01,110
Oh my god, please.

1611
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,420
Yeah, stay over there.

1612
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,120
Stay trapped in there, buddy.

1613
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,580
Oh, I'm gonna die, aren't I?

1614
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,000
I'm gonna die real.

1615
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,340
Devil trigger to heal?

1616
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:15,880
Okay.

1617
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:21,000
This guy is like stuck in the wall, actually.

1618
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:25,880
Oh my god.

1619
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:26,800
I lived.

1620
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:28,460
Somehow.

1621
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:28,660
Somehow.

1622
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:43,820
I'm not even doing anything to him.

1623
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:44,920
I think I hit him once.

1624
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,580
Are you gonna come out of there?

1625
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:56,760
Taunt?

1626
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:22,310
Uh oh, he's getting unstuck.

1627
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,820
I'm so scared.

1628
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,920
What happens when I run out of yellow orbs?

1629
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:41,660
What does that mean?

1630
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,720
Do I have to start again from the beginning of the game?

1631
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,700
I'm so scared.

1632
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,000
Just a level.

1633
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:58,320
Okay.

1634
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,700
Oh, we are all the way back here.

1635
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,000
Okay.

1636
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,020
Oh, just kidding.

1637
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:09,220
We are all the way back here.

1638
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,280
The game isn't that cruel.

1639
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:18,340
You can never tell with these older games, right?

1640
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,640
Wait, so how did I... Hold on.

1641
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:21,780
How did I dodge again?

1642
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,280
No, it was...

1643
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,840
I was holding something and I was able to dodge.

1644
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,320
Like dodge roll.

1645
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:30,860
I didn't mean to use that.

1646
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,760
Lock on.

1647
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,600
That's what I did.

1648
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:38,980
But it's still jumping.

1649
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:45,880
Backflip.

1650
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:51,880
R1 side jump.

1651
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:56,300
Oh my god.

1652
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:58,380
So this actually...

1653
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:59,240
Okay, okay.

1654
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,680
Jump has iframes too.

1655
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:04,800
Does it?

1656
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:09,940
I hope I didn't just waste my devil trigger.

1657
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,120
Can I skip cutscenes?

1658
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:12,680
Oh, I can.

1659
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,100
Awesome.

1660
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,220
Get in the wall.

1661
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:29,740
Get in the wall, spider.

1662
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:33,830
Oh my god.

1663
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:34,270
Jump away.

1664
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,560
Okay, yeah.

1665
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:48,180
He is in the wall.

1666
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:03,610
I can't tell when he is about to do what attack, you know?

1667
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,100
Can I get his behind?

1668
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,000
No!

1669
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:23,260
You are so fast!

1670
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,400
Oh my gosh.

1671
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:25,360
These parts are so...

1672
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:30,670
Jump Dante.

1673
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:31,230
Jump Dante.

1674
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:42,620
Pretend it's Elden Ring.

1675
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,840
Okay, I'll pretend it's a game I've never played before.

1676
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:45,860
Good idea.

1677
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:49,360
Good plan.

1678
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:49,820
Good plan.

1679
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,280
Good plan.

1680
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:57,600
Oh my gosh.

1681
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:58,220
That was so close.

1682
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,000
I can't tell when he is about to do the...

1683
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,460
Oh my gosh.

1684
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,720
Just gonna run around.

1685
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,740
The trees really get me.

1686
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,280
They are too sexy.

1687
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,460
Too sexy trees.

1688
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:26,220
They are so fast!

1689
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,860
Oh my gosh!

1690
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:30,000
They are so...

1691
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:32,240
Those ones are so fast.

1692
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:33,640
They get me every time.

1693
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,240
Oh my gosh.

1694
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:47,400
Save.

1695
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:48,060
Can I save here?

1696
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,280
Oh wait.

1697
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:52,180
Save.

1698
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,320
I don't even know if this will do anything.

1699
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:55,580
Let's try.

1700
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:59,100
Turn the stinger control...

1701
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,600
It's R1 left stick.

1702
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:03,900
In whatever direction Dante is facing.

1703
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,560
Plus melee button.

1704
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:09,140
OK.

1705
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:09,520
Hold on.

1706
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:10,640
OK.

1707
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,740
So R1 left stick.

1708
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,120
Melee.

1709
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,160
Like that?

1710
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:19,700
What?

1711
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,940
There is a moves list in the menu.

1712
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,880
I'm moving forward.

1713
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:32,080
Wait.

1714
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,460
Like that!

1715
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,140
Like that?

1716
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:43,410
OK.

1717
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:45,170
So it's...

1718
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:46,490
It's only...

1719
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:46,730
OK.

1720
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:48,450
So if I'm looking this way...

1721
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:50,070
I have to be pressing right.

1722
01:43:50,590 --> 01:43:51,230
OK.

1723
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:51,470
OK.

1724
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:51,750
OK.

1725
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,870
OK.

1726
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:54,390
So I can't be...

1727
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,830
Forward.

1728
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:56,970
OK.

1729
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:06,410
So it wouldn't be...

1730
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:07,650
It would be this way.

1731
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:08,650
No.

1732
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:09,310
It wouldn't...

1733
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:12,430
Sometimes it's a little confusing.

1734
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:12,910
Wait.

1735
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:13,190
OK.

1736
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:14,850
You're looking this way.

1737
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:15,870
OK.

1738
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:16,150
OK.

1739
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:16,450
OK.

1740
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:18,830
OK.

1741
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:19,190
OK.

1742
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:19,470
OK.

1743
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:29,910
I think the key is to kind of...

1744
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:31,230
Start walking a direction.

1745
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:33,010
Hold and then...

1746
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:35,830
Like if I'm walking this way and then I hold...

1747
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:37,590
I can get it.

1748
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:38,330
You know what I mean?

1749
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:41,670
And I don't have to change...

1750
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:44,090
I don't have to change stick directions.

1751
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:45,230
Yeah.

1752
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:46,670
OK.

1753
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:46,950
OK.

1754
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:47,210
OK.

1755
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,790
OK.

1756
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:49,030
OK.

1757
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:49,210
OK.

1758
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:50,930
Try the opposite direction.

1759
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:51,230
Wait.

1760
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:52,390
What do you mean the opposite direction?

1761
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:57,030
Try R1 back melee.

1762
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:58,150
Like that?

1763
01:44:59,230 --> 01:44:59,550
Wait.

1764
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:02,050
Did I just do it?

1765
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:03,670
Ah.

1766
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:07,190
That's...

1767
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,030
That's a launcher.

1768
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:10,830
What does that mean?

1769
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,660
It launches enemies.

1770
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,340
OK.

1771
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,560
Holding the attack button.

1772
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:24,720
Nothing.

1773
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,720
Just draw some.

1774
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,440
Welcome to membership.

1775
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:28,180
Thank you.

1776
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:30,560
OK.

1777
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:30,680
OK.

1778
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,800
Let's try...

1779
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,040
Wait.

1780
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,100
I want to try one more time.

1781
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:37,980
OK.

1782
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:39,640
OK.

1783
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:39,920
OK.

1784
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:55,890
For the

1785
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:32,830
first time just now.

1786
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:06,330
Thank you.

1787
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:07,050
Thank you for the tank.

1788
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:07,930
Thank you.

1789
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:12,430
Yippee!

1790
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:18,530
I'm a one trick pony you guys.

1791
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:24,970
At least... Wait.

1792
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:26,230
Did I go out the wrong way?

1793
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:29,370
At least you know if I learn something I apply it.

1794
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:33,550
And then I... Stop bullying him.

1795
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:36,570
I apply it and then I use it.

1796
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:37,310
I don't know.

1797
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:40,630
Yippee!

1798
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:43,870
Oh my god.

1799
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:46,970
DMC survive an encounter with Phantom.

1800
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:48,150
That's me.

1801
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,820
Thank you.

1802
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:57,140
How did I get worse?

1803
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:03,300
What do you mean you can't just spam one attack and make it?

1804
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:07,220
That should have... I did it so fast.

1805
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,540
What are you talking about?

1806
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:10,780
No style.

1807
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:14,140
Who needs style when you clear the mission?

1808
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,980
No style points.

1809
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:21,740
So sad.

1810
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:25,680
Guys, I'm starting to get so hungry.

1811
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,740
Display one strength to the lion and open the path.

1812
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:32,820
Acquire the melancholy soul.

1813
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:33,760
OK.

1814
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:34,960
Wait, can I power up?

1815
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,400
Thanks for the super chat!

1816
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:42,580
Probably didn't notice, but hitting him with a stinger when he's about to shoot a fireball from his mouth can...

1817
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:42,900
I know!

1818
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:44,280
I did notice.

1819
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:45,320
I did notice.

1820
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:49,880
That's why I didn't jump away when he was powering up that fire attack.

1821
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,740
That's why I was just like...

1822
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:55,420
I did notice.

1823
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,180
Oh no, I can't buy anything else.

1824
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,320
Any extra?

1825
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,140
I can buy a blue orb!

1826
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,620
I'm gonna buy it.

1827
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:08,940
Yeah, I did it two times.

1828
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:10,140
I did, I did, I did, I did.

1829
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,240
I noticed, I noticed, I noticed.

1830
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:14,040
Alright, mission start baby.

1831
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,880
Blue orb time.

1832
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:22,980
Where?

1833
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:23,860
Oh, it was down here.

1834
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:03,350
I understand now.

1835
01:50:03,350 --> 01:50:03,370
What?

1836
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:06,890
Uh oh.

1837
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:08,050
No!

1838
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:10,390
Run Dante!

1839
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:11,490
Dante just run.

1840
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:13,250
Just run Dante.

1841
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:13,990
Run and jump Dante.

1842
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:16,070
Run and jump Dante.

1843
01:50:16,490 --> 01:50:17,590
Run and jump Dante.

1844
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,150
Run and jump Dante.

1845
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:21,330
Hide Dante!

1846
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:22,270
Hide Dante!

1847
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:31,620
Did I go to the wrong room?

1848
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,060
Is he gonna be out there?

1849
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,700
The spider got it's revenge.

1850
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,180
Please be gone.

1851
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:47,740
Oh my god.

1852
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:52,380
Die,

1853
01:51:07,610 --> 01:51:08,370
die, die.

1854
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:10,850
Alright, everything is destroyed.

1855
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:12,070
Stupid spider.

1856
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:14,210
It's just ruining the whole building.

1857
01:51:16,190 --> 01:51:17,690
Worst enemy, you think so?

1858
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:22,670
Okay lion, I'm here to prove my worth.

1859
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:29,930
There is an immense power that will not allow anyone to get closer.

1860
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:32,310
Before I can confront the lion, I'll need a sign.

1861
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,670
Shall I use the pride of lion?

1862
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:34,050
Yes.

1863
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:41,810
Here sleeps the gatekeeper.

1864
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:44,470
Magical destruction will awaken him.

1865
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:53,690
Guns seem kind of magical to me, but you know...

1866
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,740
Here we go.

1867
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:15,900
He ended me instantly.

1868
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:18,900
No way!

1869
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,220
I...I...

1870
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:27,900
He...yes.

1871
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,340
He killed me instantly.

1872
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:34,420
Start game at this data?

1873
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:34,840
Yes.

1874
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,240
Oh my gosh!

1875
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,480
I have to do the spider again.

1876
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,340
I have to do the spider again.

1877
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:56,030
Oh my gosh!

1878
01:52:56,110 --> 01:52:57,690
That one gets me every time!

1879
01:52:57,810 --> 01:52:58,210
Wait, Dante!

1880
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:59,550
We can't keep taking hits, Dante!

1881
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:00,910
Dante, please!

1882
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:02,410
Okay.

1883
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:07,550
Alright, he's gone, right?

1884
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:13,710
I'm just gonna run from you.

1885
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:19,490
I don't have time to deal with you right now.

1886
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:22,570
Okay.

1887
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:28,170
This guy, like, instantly takes me out.

1888
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:34,070
The enemy's name is called Psycho Siren.

1889
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:34,850
It's pretty good.

1890
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,020
This guy is your dodge check?

1891
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:47,000
Oh gosh.

1892
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:54,160
So if I jump away, it's like the same.

1893
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:55,940
But he, like, instantly grabs me.

1894
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:56,680
It's so crazy.

1895
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:57,180
Okay.

1896
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,540
I'm ready to dodge.

1897
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,200
I'm ready to dodge.

1898
01:53:59,240 --> 01:53:59,520
I'm ready.

1899
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:00,660
I'm ready to dodge.

1900
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:32,360
Ouch!

1901
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:32,780
Ouchie!

1902
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:33,480
Oh my god.

1903
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,840
This is gonna kill me, isn't it?

1904
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:39,430
I shouldn't be greedy.

1905
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:41,230
I should only do, like, one hit, shouldn't I?

1906
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:41,670
Oh my god!

1907
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:42,410
Oh my god!

1908
01:54:42,630 --> 01:54:42,930
Oh my god!

1909
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:43,470
Oh my god!

1910
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:44,070
Oh my god!

1911
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:46,610
Where is he?

1912
01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:26,490
Maybe I should keep shooting.

1913
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:29,250
Or maybe I should have sworded it.

1914
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:29,670
Okay.

1915
01:55:32,410 --> 01:55:35,290
Should I sword it when it's that far?

1916
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:37,870
Oh my god.

1917
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:41,290
Linto.

1918
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:43,310
How am I supposed to know?

1919
01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:45,450
Swordman.

1920
01:55:45,490 --> 01:55:46,710
How am I supposed to know?

1921
01:55:46,810 --> 01:55:48,830
It's my first time playing the game.

1922
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:51,270
How am I supposed to know?

1923
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:56,390
How am I supposed to know?

1924
01:55:56,650 --> 01:55:57,870
My gosh.

1925
01:55:57,990 --> 01:56:00,210
You guys are so mean sometimes.

1926
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:01,830
You're just like, gosh, VTuber.

1927
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:08,170
VTuber, how do you not know the very obvious information that is given to you in the game, VTuber?

1928
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:09,630
How do you not know?

1929
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:17,910
The first time you play this game, how did you not immediately read everything about the game that you need to know?

1930
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:22,210
To understand that... And how did you not memorize every single boss?

1931
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:24,250
VTuber, did you not do your research?

1932
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:26,650
VTuber, I expected more from you.

1933
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:32,270
You are streaming a game that means you obviously know everything about the game, VTuber.

1934
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:38,690
VTuber, I came here and I thought that I would see a perfect fight, VTuber.

1935
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:40,630
How dare you not do your research?

1936
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:45,450
VTuber!

1937
01:56:56,040 --> 01:57:06,180
VTuber, you dodged, but when he opened up his body, you didn't know that was... That was... Like, VTuber!

1938
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:20,000
Oh my god.

1939
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:20,240
How?

1940
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:20,620
What?

1941
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:21,340
That's

1942
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:18,390
a...

1943
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,330
Oh, did I kill him?

1944
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:20,290
No.

1945
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:22,110
Oh, I think I killed him.

1946
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:22,730
Yippee!

1947
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:27,290
Charge!

1948
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:31,270
Yippee!

1949
01:58:35,530 --> 01:58:38,350
Do you have any goods for me?

1950
01:58:39,490 --> 01:58:39,950
Nothing?

1951
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:40,270
Oh.

1952
01:58:41,010 --> 01:58:41,570
Yippee!

1953
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:49,710
Let's keep going.

1954
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:53,190
Oh, wrong button.

1955
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:57,870
Oh my gosh.

1956
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:12,110
VTuber, you did it!

1957
01:59:12,210 --> 01:59:12,810
I did!

1958
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:14,030
Thank you!

1959
01:59:18,210 --> 01:59:19,930
VTuber, why did you learn so fast, VTuber?

1960
01:59:21,270 --> 01:59:22,390
Do I just keep going up?

1961
01:59:22,730 --> 01:59:24,130
There was stuff downstairs though, wasn't there?

1962
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:25,590
Wasn't there stuff down?

1963
01:59:26,210 --> 01:59:27,910
I want to go down instead of going up.

1964
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:29,190
I want to.

1965
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:30,710
Or maybe I don't want to go down.

1966
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:32,670
It looks kind of deep.

1967
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:33,210
Nevermind.

1968
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:34,310
We do not want to go down.

1969
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:35,570
Or wait, what's over here?

1970
01:59:43,190 --> 01:59:43,870
It's a circle.

1971
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,350
I want to go down.

1972
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:49,230
No, I do not.

1973
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:57,290
Oh my gosh, you scared me.

1974
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:11,370
It said... OK, the mission was to find some sort of statue, right?

1975
02:00:11,410 --> 02:00:13,450
So I'm going to keep going up.

1976
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:16,850
Is this a statue?

1977
02:00:16,850 --> 02:00:18,990
There is something written.

1978
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:21,730
The sword is the key to freeing the soul.

1979
02:00:22,130 --> 02:00:24,130
The key resides at the highest place.

1980
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,410
My sword.

1981
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:32,090
Oh my goodness.

1982
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:34,790
Can I jump over here?

1983
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:43,350
VTuber, why did you not get all the orbs in the level?

1984
02:00:44,030 --> 02:00:44,410
I know.

1985
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:45,790
And the worst, I'm sorry.

1986
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:48,350
It's a mirror.

1987
02:00:49,610 --> 02:00:50,410
It's me.

1988
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:59,650
It's a statue of a female with a melancholic expression.

1989
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:01,970
And she's sucking on that egg.

1990
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:04,690
There is an opening to place something.

1991
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:05,490
A sword.

1992
02:01:09,730 --> 02:01:10,570
I think.

1993
02:01:12,170 --> 02:01:24,270
I love watching videos where they go behind the scenes of games and everything.

1994
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:29,830
Because you learn how they do mirror effects and things like that.

1995
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:32,750
Or like how they make lighting.

1996
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,930
They'll just put a block behind something.

1997
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:41,590
Or like a lighter block behind another block to make it seem like it's glowing or something.

1998
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:42,770
You know, things like that.

1999
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:44,590
Sometimes they just make another room.

2000
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:46,170
Yeah, it's so interesting.

2001
02:01:47,710 --> 02:01:48,450
Boundary break.

2002
02:01:48,490 --> 02:01:49,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2003
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:53,810
An emblem of a sun is engraved.

2004
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:55,130
There's something written beneath it.

2005
02:01:55,710 --> 02:01:58,170
The brightness of the guiding light will scorch you.

2006
02:01:59,370 --> 02:02:02,770
Only those who can bear the light can open the new path.

2007
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:08,010
There are documents here that were probably used for diplomacy.

2008
02:02:08,510 --> 02:02:08,810
What?

2009
02:02:09,070 --> 02:02:10,250
With the neighboring country.

2010
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:10,810
So why?

2011
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:12,450
Where did my mom go?

2012
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:15,310
Where is my hot mom?

2013
02:02:18,790 --> 02:02:20,530
Hot mom, where are you?

2014
02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:22,070
Question.

2015
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:24,570
If this thing is here, is this a safe room?

2016
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:29,990
Is it a safe room if this thing is here?

2017
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:32,310
Holy water.

2018
02:02:33,070 --> 02:02:34,530
I can get another orb.

2019
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:37,070
Yes?

2020
02:02:37,230 --> 02:02:37,610
Oh, cool.

2021
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:43,540
She died.

2022
02:02:43,620 --> 02:02:44,600
Then who was that lady?

2023
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:46,620
I can buy the air raid, you guys.

2024
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:50,160
Become airborne and be capable of performing aerial electrocution?

2025
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:50,720
I don't know.

2026
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:55,580
Maybe I should save up for stinger level 2.

2027
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:58,200
Even though I didn't use it at all.

2028
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:02,440
I think I'll save up for stinger level 2.

2029
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:06,340
I think so.

2030
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:08,780
I'll save up, I'll save up.

2031
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:11,100
I think I can destroy the bed.

2032
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:14,400
This is a fancy room, isn't it?

2033
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,520
Hot dog.

2034
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:19,120
Okay.

2035
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:22,460
It's sealed shut by immense power.

2036
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:27,160
Alright, puzzle time.

2037
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:35,660
There was that area with the guy... Okay, wait.

2038
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:38,020
It says I need to get... What was the mission?

2039
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:40,260
Mission.

2040
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:42,720
Display... Okay.

2041
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:44,640
Acquire the melancholy soul.

2042
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:47,660
That's what we're trying to do here.

2043
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,400
How do I insert?

2044
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,680
There's an opening to place something.

2045
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:57,340
Is it not my sword?

2046
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,580
I was just hopping around.

2047
02:04:15,820 --> 02:04:17,400
My sword is too thick.

2048
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:37,220
There's more of them.

2049
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:38,100
I see them down there.

2050
02:04:58,220 --> 02:04:59,820
Can I just... 1, 2, hit.

2051
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:00,880
1, 2, 3.

2052
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:01,720
1, 2, 3.

2053
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:07,880
Chat, she knows this is supposed to be Resident Evil 4, right?

2054
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:08,380
Yes.

2055
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:09,660
Yes, I know.

2056
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:10,020
Please.

2057
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:11,520
I know.

2058
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:12,820
I know.

2059
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:13,280
Wait.

2060
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:16,300
Was this supposed to be Resident Evil 4?

2061
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:20,920
You might want to tell me one more time.

2062
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:22,740
To make it really stick in there.

2063
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:24,800
My old noggin is kind of old, you know.

2064
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:33,620
Next you're going to tell me that Jaeger means hunter in German.

2065
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:43,780
Did you know this is supposed to be DMC1?

2066
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:49,160
Minto, this is supposed to be Resident Evil 4.

2067
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:50,560
No.

2068
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:53,640
Am I supp...

2069
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:57,900
Why did you

2070
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:03,940
teleport like that?

2071
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:17,060
What if I... You know what?

2072
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:18,220
I'm going to rewrite history.

2073
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:22,440
It was actually supposed to be Resident Evil 3.

2074
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,420
How about that?

2075
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,460
How about them apples?

2076
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,560
You didn't expect that, huh?

2077
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:30,840
Ok, wait.

2078
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:31,700
Am I supposed to...

2079
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:35,120
Ok, I need to go find the sword.

2080
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:38,600
The only thing that I know about the souls... Hold on.

2081
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:39,740
I'm going up to the very top.

2082
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,120
What did it say again up here?

2083
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:47,920
We're two hours into this stream.

2084
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,780
We're out of trivia.

2085
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:52,960
There's something written.

2086
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:55,200
The sword is the key to freeing the soul.

2087
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:55,500
Yeah.

2088
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:58,380
The key resides at the highest place.

2089
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:02,320
The highest place.

2090
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:03,540
Here?

2091
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:08,240
How do I go any higher?

2092
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,280
The highest place.

2093
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:23,360
I'm on the fifth floor.

2094
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:26,420
I'm at the highest place.

2095
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:28,780
Wait.

2096
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,800
Ok, I'm scared to jump, but I'm going to try.

2097
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,600
Is this an elevator that will go up?

2098
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:09,540
Death sentence.

2099
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,820
A decorative sword used for rituals.

2100
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:13,180
It cannot be used as a weapon.

2101
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:19,580
I want to go... I was going to say I want to go down.

2102
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:26,080
What's this door?

2103
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:29,140
Sealed shut by immense power.

2104
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:29,920
There's something written.

2105
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:32,300
This path will open with a guiding soul.

2106
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:36,160
Wait, what's up here though?

2107
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:40,240
That's metal.

2108
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:52,720
You like that?

2109
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:54,920
I did that aerial thing.

2110
02:08:57,540 --> 02:09:00,260
Stairs are blocked off so I can't go any further this way.

2111
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,600
Gosh, it makes me dizzy though.

2112
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:09,060
Hi!

2113
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:09,440
Hi!

2114
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:10,020
Hi!

2115
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:12,860
Alright, let's go up.

2116
02:09:15,660 --> 02:09:17,100
I left during spider.

2117
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:18,740
Why did you leave, Tiaro?

2118
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:20,060
How dare you!

2119
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:23,980
I did good.

2120
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:25,780
Right chat?

2121
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:29,040
Everybody say... Minto did it.

2122
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,060
She's so smart.

2123
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:37,840
Death sentence, yes.

2124
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:42,800
Oh god!

2125
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:46,140
Melancholy soul.

2126
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:47,820
An ornament resembling a soul.

2127
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:50,240
When activated, it loses its power over time.

2128
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:52,600
Uh oh.

2129
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:53,280
What's happening?

2130
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:00,540
Is it my reflection?

2131
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:03,020
Don't trust anybody, not even yourself!

2132
02:10:03,140 --> 02:10:04,300
Dante, turn around!

2133
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:05,480
Oh my god.

2134
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,900
I'm evil Dante.

2135
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:11,680
Oh my god!

2136
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:24,310
Oh my god, me!

2137
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:27,490
I'm so sexy!

2138
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:30,210
Nevermind!

2139
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:31,610
Actually...

2140
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:32,290
Dad?

2141
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:33,490
Wait...

2142
02:10:33,930 --> 02:10:35,850
Isn't that the guy?

2143
02:10:45,250 --> 02:10:46,090
Oh snap!

2144
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,200
Isn't that the guy with the horns at the very beginning?

2145
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:54,540
Or am I crazy?

2146
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:56,520
Oh, bye!

2147
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:03,160
Not Sparta.

2148
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:04,420
Oh, I look just like him.

2149
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:06,640
What did this say again?

2150
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:10,580
The brightness of the guiding light will scorch you.

2151
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,360
Only those who bear the light can open it.

2152
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:16,220
I'm guessing I go... Oh, should I have saved?

2153
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:19,600
Let's do that real quick.

2154
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:24,520
Cool.

2155
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:30,020
Ouch!

2156
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:31,340
Oh my gosh, it can hurt me.

2157
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:32,740
I learned.

2158
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:38,840
Oh, smiley face.

2159
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:40,100
OK, I won't look, I won't look.

2160
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:41,300
Thanks guys!

2161
02:11:55,760 --> 02:12:00,020
Oh my gosh.

2162
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:01,660
This is sword fight, huh?

2163
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,800
I learned this!

2164
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:14,760
Ouchie!

2165
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:19,640
Ouch!

2166
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:23,540
OK.

2167
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:27,480
I need to dodge that faster.

2168
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:35,170
Stop parrying me!

2169
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:36,390
Stop it!

2170
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:37,350
Stop it!

2171
02:12:37,630 --> 02:12:38,110
Stop it!

2172
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:38,590
Ouch!

2173
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:39,350
Oh my god!

2174
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:40,190
Oh my god!

2175
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:45,770
OK, I got greedy you guys.

2176
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:46,470
It's my fault.

2177
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:48,790
I got greedy.

2178
02:12:53,710 --> 02:12:55,050
I got greedy.

2179
02:12:55,310 --> 02:12:55,670
It's OK.

2180
02:13:01,290 --> 02:13:02,850
Wait, from the start?

2181
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:17,240
Secret?

2182
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:19,680
Wait, defeat 100 phantom babies.

2183
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:21,600
What the hell is a phantom baby?

2184
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:24,080
Wait, what?

2185
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:24,580
Secret.

2186
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:27,880
I did save!

2187
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:36,220
What's the matter baby?

2188
02:13:37,060 --> 02:13:37,700
Nothing much.

2189
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:38,760
What's the matter with you?

2190
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:44,020
Um, phantom babies.

2191
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,260
You know what, I'll try... What is...

2192
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:47,720
Oh my god.

2193
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:48,880
It's these guys.

2194
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:55,280
I have to get... Oh my gosh.

2195
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:56,740
Destroy!

2196
02:13:56,840 --> 02:13:56,980
Destroy!

2197
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:58,060
Destroy!

2198
02:13:58,200 --> 02:13:58,400
Destroy!

2199
02:13:58,540 --> 02:13:58,740
Destroy!

2200
02:13:59,300 --> 02:13:59,620
Destroy!

2201
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:03,240
I'm only halfway there.

2202
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:04,700
Where is the rest of them?

2203
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:05,620
Oh, I'll go this way.

2204
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:06,540
Destroy!

2205
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:06,820
Destroy!

2206
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:07,080
Destroy!

2207
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:13,200
These are little random spiders or phantom babies!

2208
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:15,240
Uh oh, I'm not gonna make it.

2209
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:17,540
OK,

2210
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:22,840
put me out of my misery, OK?

2211
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:25,100
I know I didn't make it, but stop the mission.

2212
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:28,040
So close.

2213
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:35,200
Can I redo it?

2214
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,220
Gotta leave the room.

2215
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:36,500
OK.

2216
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:42,860
Wait, I came from here.

2217
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:47,780
Thanks.

2218
02:14:51,470 --> 02:14:52,070
Thank you.

2219
02:14:52,930 --> 02:14:53,850
Alright, let's try again.

2220
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:59,610
What's like a good... What's a good strat for this?

2221
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:00,270
I don't know.

2222
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:04,630
I feel like one at a time is too...

2223
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:04,850
OK,

2224
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:13,200
wait, hold on.

2225
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:13,960
I have a good idea.

2226
02:15:14,060 --> 02:15:14,560
I have a good idea.

2227
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:15,860
Where are they?

2228
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:17,480
Where are the matter babies?

2229
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:19,320
Where are the matter babies?

2230
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:19,940
Oh, here they are.

2231
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:27,420
Oh, maybe that wasn't such a... That didn't go as well in my head as I thought.

2232
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,020
OK, it doesn't do anything actually.

2233
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:30,040
Oh, it kinda does.

2234
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:37,990
OK, I got a single matter baby.

2235
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:39,310
Phantom baby.

2236
02:15:39,570 --> 02:15:39,830
My bad.

2237
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:40,290
Hold on.

2238
02:15:40,670 --> 02:15:40,870
Wait.

2239
02:15:41,870 --> 02:15:42,730
How many did I kill?

2240
02:15:45,730 --> 02:15:46,810
How many did I get?

2241
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:47,190
Gun?

2242
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:51,780
I don't think it works as well.

2243
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:53,200
78!

2244
02:16:00,550 --> 02:16:04,570
But, guys, look at all the... Wait, you guys, this is easy.

2245
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:07,230
You guys, this is so... Oh, get the pistols.

2246
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:07,550
Yeah.

2247
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:11,010
This is such an easy way to farm.

2248
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:12,530
Oh, I went the wrong way.

2249
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:14,130
But this is kind of awesome.

2250
02:16:14,350 --> 02:16:14,590
Yeah.

2251
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:15,670
Wait, this is...

2252
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:18,650
This is the perfect way to farm the rorbs.

2253
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:19,070
Yeah!

2254
02:16:20,610 --> 02:16:21,290
OK, hold on.

2255
02:16:21,950 --> 02:16:22,450
Oh, wrong way.

2256
02:16:22,690 --> 02:16:23,030
There we go.

2257
02:16:23,030 --> 02:16:24,050
Weapon.

2258
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:25,170
Handgun.

2259
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:27,170
Equip.

2260
02:16:27,490 --> 02:16:27,890
Yes.

2261
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:41,330
Squish and walk.

2262
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:42,950
Squish and shoot.

2263
02:16:43,370 --> 02:16:46,030
Squish with feet and shoot with gun.

2264
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:48,750
Squish with feet and shoot with gun.

2265
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:50,610
Always be shooting.

2266
02:16:54,270 --> 02:16:55,470
Always be shooting.

2267
02:16:55,530 --> 02:16:56,590
Always be shooting and squishing.

2268
02:16:56,910 --> 02:16:57,610
Shooting and squishing.

2269
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:59,750
Shooting and squishing.

2270
02:17:00,570 --> 02:17:03,530
Did I do it?

2271
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:04,210
Did I do it?

2272
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:22,280
Wait, I should have just kept failing so I could farm it over and over again.

2273
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:25,740
Honestly, this is such a good way to farm for rorbs.

2274
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:30,820
Such a good way to farm for rorbs.

2275
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:42,280
Little spiders.

2276
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:47,320
Where are you?

2277
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:51,840
Anybody else?

2278
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:53,620
Oh.

2279
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:56,080
Right there.

2280
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:58,560
I'll eat every last one.

2281
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:00,620
Of those orbs, not the spiders.

2282
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,900
Not actually.

2283
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:07,820
That's not actually a good way to farm.

2284
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:10,960
OK, it's an easy way to farm.

2285
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:15,320
I guess they're all gone.

2286
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:16,840
Nice.

2287
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:20,200
Easy means good.

2288
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:23,460
Complete a secret mission.

2289
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,680
Can you keep a secret?

2290
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:38,460
OK.

2291
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:42,540
Let's also change back to my shotgun.

2292
02:18:43,580 --> 02:18:46,220
Wait, so I have to do the spider again, right?

2293
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:48,120
He's gonna come out here, I think?

2294
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:52,800
And then I have to... Wait, do I have to do the lion again?

2295
02:19:01,710 --> 02:19:03,330
Oh no...

2296
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:22,580
I don't care about the painting!

2297
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,800
What?

2298
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:27,860
Phantababy too?

2299
02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:37,010
You feed a hundred Phantababy?

2300
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:02,940
Kill all Phantababies!

2301
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:04,520
Kill them dead!

2302
02:20:07,710 --> 02:20:09,150
Where's the rest of them?

2303
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:10,330
What do you mean 61?

2304
02:20:10,590 --> 02:20:11,450
Where's the rest of them?

2305
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:18,850
There's... There was not that many in this room!

2306
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:22,330
Oh, without weapons.

2307
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:25,250
Oh, I didn't read that part.

2308
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:27,510
I definitely didn't read that part.

2309
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:34,350
Wait, we'll go back in.

2310
02:20:34,450 --> 02:20:34,970
We'll go back in.

2311
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:35,910
No, no, no.

2312
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:36,950
Not you.

2313
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:39,370
Phantababy too.

2314
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:43,730
Without using any weapons.

2315
02:20:50,290 --> 02:20:51,390
This seems impossible.

2316
02:20:52,270 --> 02:20:53,490
This seems actually impossible.

2317
02:20:57,210 --> 02:20:58,830
Come on Dante, run!

2318
02:20:59,290 --> 02:21:00,190
Run and squish!

2319
02:21:00,330 --> 02:21:00,950
Run and squish!

2320
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:01,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2321
02:21:01,910 --> 02:21:02,670
Get all in the middle.

2322
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:04,090
Come here to the middle, little babies.

2323
02:21:04,470 --> 02:21:05,210
Come to the middle.

2324
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:08,710
We were so close!

2325
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:12,470
We were so close.

2326
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:15,290
We were like 93.

2327
02:21:18,370 --> 02:21:19,170
You failed.

2328
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:21,350
Guys, I'm gonna buy so many upgrades.

2329
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:27,990
And by upgrades I mean... More of that one... What's it called?

2330
02:21:29,650 --> 02:21:32,410
Does... Will Devil Trigger count as a weapon?

2331
02:21:43,660 --> 02:21:44,720
I guess not.

2332
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:00,000
We have enough for a blue orb!

2333
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:04,430
Blue demon!

2334
02:22:05,030 --> 02:22:05,870
Yeah, baby!

2335
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:07,350
We did it!

2336
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:07,790
We did it!

2337
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:08,490
We did it!

2338
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:11,990
Kill

2339
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:23,350
them till they're dead.

2340
02:22:24,270 --> 02:22:24,570
Nice.

2341
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:25,670
Let's upgrade.

2342
02:22:25,850 --> 02:22:26,210
Oh my gosh.

2343
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:26,910
Camera, please.

2344
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:28,070
Please, camera.

2345
02:22:31,210 --> 02:22:31,810
Alistar.

2346
02:22:33,130 --> 02:22:34,390
Singer level 2!

2347
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:36,590
Wait.

2348
02:22:37,470 --> 02:22:39,690
Wait, how... What is the round trip?

2349
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:41,390
Throw the sword like a boomerang.

2350
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:45,830
What's air... Double... Double jump?

2351
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:48,990
I have to pay to double jump.

2352
02:22:50,030 --> 02:22:52,330
And there's also Vortex level 1.

2353
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:55,210
Damage enemies with an intense spinning body attack.

2354
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,340
Should we get Stinger level 2 and then save up for Air Hike?

2355
02:23:07,530 --> 02:23:08,970
Air Hike is worth it.

2356
02:23:15,750 --> 02:23:18,590
Stinger and then... Okay, let's try it.

2357
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:21,230
Nice.

2358
02:23:21,490 --> 02:23:21,750
Alright.

2359
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:25,330
It's a lot to save up, but I believe in us.

2360
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:28,890
I believe in us.

2361
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:46,820
I'm so salty that we have to redo...

2362
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:49,360
That we have to redo the lion.

2363
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:53,600
I'm so salty about that.

2364
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:57,860
Secret mission clear!

2365
02:23:58,660 --> 02:23:58,880
Baby!

2366
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:00,460
Oh my gosh, she's so sexy.

2367
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:02,960
Sorry, Minto.

2368
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:03,800
That's okay.

2369
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:05,740
Is it because I'm out of...

2370
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:07,400
Oh my god.

2371
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:08,040
Oh my god.

2372
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:12,040
Is it because I'm out of yellow orbs?

2373
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:12,660
Is that why?

2374
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:24,000
Do you want to be backseated on how to find secret missions?

2375
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:29,320
No, because I don't plan on 100%ing the game or anything like that.

2376
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:35,120
So I don't want to always be feeling like I'm pressured to find the secret missions.

2377
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:36,520
But thanks for asking.

2378
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:39,700
Yellow orbs are checkpoints.

2379
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:43,960
Yeah, it's fun to find the surprise, right?

2380
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:47,960
So if I...

2381
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:56,940
If I die again, which I feel like I will, I'll have to...

2382
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:59,020
I'll have to...

2383
02:25:00,140 --> 02:25:02,220
Well, I have to do the secret missions again though.

2384
02:25:13,090 --> 02:25:14,350
Okay, here we go guys.

2385
02:25:14,410 --> 02:25:14,950
Here we go.

2386
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:17,150
Here we go.

2387
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:17,630
Here we go.

2388
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:18,610
I'm ready to dodge.

2389
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:23,070
I don't have to do them again because I saved.

2390
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:44,540
Where is he?

2391
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:50,020
I know it's a lion and I called it a dog.

2392
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:21,800
Okay.

2393
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:24,500
What just happened?

2394
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:31,440
Was that a suicide bomb?

2395
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,260
I think so.

2396
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,280
What just happened?

2397
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:46,060
Wait, I want to...

2398
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:01,380
They do that sometimes.

2399
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:02,100
No way.

2400
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:03,500
Alright.

2401
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:05,140
I know what I have to do.

2402
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:07,700
Maybe... Actually, let's just jump to the bottom.

2403
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:09,300
Let's just go.

2404
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:11,300
Let's just go where we need to go, alright?

2405
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:16,240
Instead of going all the way to the top.

2406
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:25,860
When it has 1 HP, they become bombs.

2407
02:27:26,020 --> 02:27:28,620
Oh, so I like really got him low health.

2408
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:31,720
The guy is like frozen down.

2409
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:49,040
Let's go down the stairs so I don't get ambushed by this guy.

2410
02:28:04,090 --> 02:28:07,810
I don't think saving is going to do anything.

2411
02:28:08,810 --> 02:28:09,690
Save first?

2412
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:11,610
It's not going to do anything though, right?

2413
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:15,010
It doesn't... I don't have any more orbs.

2414
02:28:22,270 --> 02:28:24,150
But will it... Oh wait, actually.

2415
02:28:24,690 --> 02:28:31,510
Will saving keep my... Will saving keep my rorbs?

2416
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:34,710
It will save your rorbs.

2417
02:28:34,750 --> 02:28:35,270
It will!

2418
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:40,450
Save orbs, progress, nothing else.

2419
02:28:41,050 --> 02:28:43,410
I think that's somewhat worth it though.

2420
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:51,220
I want to buy the yellow orb.

2421
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:57,500
Oh man, why did I buy this thing or two?

2422
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:14,450
I'm going to eat a snack.

2423
02:29:14,530 --> 02:29:15,310
I hope it's OK guys.

2424
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:17,850
I have some things called cheeza.

2425
02:29:18,170 --> 02:29:20,550
Wait, this part was just a cutscene, right?

2426
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:21,210
I didn't have to fight.

2427
02:29:21,310 --> 02:29:22,210
No, it was just a cutscene.

2428
02:29:23,650 --> 02:29:24,990
I got these in Japan.

2429
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:26,510
My snacks were in Japan.

2430
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:35,760
Don't be greedy.

2431
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:37,460
Mint, don't be greedy.

2432
02:29:43,650 --> 02:29:45,050
Don't be greedy.

2433
02:29:56,990 --> 02:29:57,910
I'm dead.

2434
02:30:00,370 --> 02:30:03,050
But I need food for energy.

2435
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:14,520
Recovery star is a healing item.

2436
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:15,020
Oh...

2437
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:16,880
Oh,

2438
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,080
smiley, smiley.

2439
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:33,220
No spoilers in the chat, you guys.

2440
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:37,000
No spoilers, please.

2441
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:38,820
Is there anything over here?

2442
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:39,740
I don't think so.

2443
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:40,080
OK.

2444
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:43,460
Time to...

2445
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:44,660
Beat daddy.

2446
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:46,620
Oh gosh, I forgot about that thing.

2447
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:49,220
OK.

2448
02:30:49,220 --> 02:30:49,320
OK.

2449
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:52,360
A better singer.

2450
02:31:05,130 --> 02:31:06,870
Are you sure this is not my dad?

2451
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:07,930
It looks just like him.

2452
02:31:09,310 --> 02:31:10,170
What was his name?

2453
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:11,230
Oh my god, Sparta.

2454
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:13,630
Oh my gosh.

2455
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:14,950
Oh gosh.

2456
02:31:15,890 --> 02:31:16,530
Oh gosh.

2457
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:26,270
Ouch!

2458
02:31:26,570 --> 02:31:28,270
Oh my god, he can do the same thing as me?

2459
02:31:28,690 --> 02:31:29,570
That kind of sucks.

2460
02:31:30,370 --> 02:31:31,370
Oh my gosh.

2461
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:45,580
That was so close.

2462
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,260
What the hell, Mint?

2463
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:52,660
Can I shoot him, actually?

2464
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:56,560
No, no, no.

2465
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:01,800
Oh god, guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

2466
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:06,660
Shoot.

2467
02:32:12,220 --> 02:32:12,700
No.

2468
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:15,820
This is so bad.

2469
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:21,680
Wait, what was this?

2470
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:22,400
Vital Star.

2471
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:28,960
Use it?

2472
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:29,340
Yeah.

2473
02:32:42,430 --> 02:32:43,190
Oh, OK.

2474
02:33:02,830 --> 02:33:04,190
It takes a lot of hits.

2475
02:33:04,370 --> 02:33:05,390
Ah, shit, shit, shit.

2476
02:33:05,890 --> 02:33:06,470
No, no, no.

2477
02:33:08,810 --> 02:33:10,130
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2478
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:11,910
Oh my god, please.

2479
02:33:12,170 --> 02:33:13,610
Dante, what the fuck are you doing?

2480
02:33:13,610 --> 02:33:16,670
Why were you, like, playing hopscotch on the top of the thing?

2481
02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:17,610
Please!

2482
02:33:18,030 --> 02:33:18,290
Dante!

2483
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:19,670
Dante, Dante, Dante.

2484
02:33:33,470 --> 02:33:34,190
Oh, shoot.

2485
02:33:34,590 --> 02:33:35,430
What the hell?

2486
02:33:36,270 --> 02:33:37,590
I didn't mean to do that.

2487
02:33:37,690 --> 02:33:38,130
Oh my god.

2488
02:33:39,770 --> 02:33:41,850
I guess it saved me, though.

2489
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:56,220
She's so beefy!

2490
02:33:57,240 --> 02:33:57,720
Beefy!

2491
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:03,220
What the?

2492
02:34:03,820 --> 02:34:05,240
Oh, you're making me parkour?

2493
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:07,880
How do I get up there?

2494
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:10,240
Wait.

2495
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:11,360
I'm too small.

2496
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:14,680
Oh, I see.

2497
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:15,540
Oh, OK.

2498
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:17,980
OK, hold on.

2499
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:18,880
I'm a little slow.

2500
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:21,920
Hold on.

2501
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,540
OK, then I go up here.

2502
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:28,980
And then I...

2503
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,760
Oh, shoot.

2504
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:41,360
Oh, no.

2505
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:44,300
Please, why don't I have any iframes or anything?

2506
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:46,360
Oh, gosh.

2507
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:48,460
Oh my god.

2508
02:34:48,540 --> 02:34:49,000
No, no!

2509
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:57,180
What does DT mean?

2510
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,440
Oh, double trigger!

2511
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:11,940
Double trigger?

2512
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:19,920
DT heals!

2513
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:20,900
I forgot.

2514
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:21,880
It's my fault.

2515
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:22,940
I know, I forgot.

2516
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:29,350
Oh, gosh.

2517
02:35:29,430 --> 02:35:32,570
It's so much that I fall all the way back.

2518
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:37,870
Oh, come on.

2519
02:35:37,910 --> 02:35:38,370
I jumped.

2520
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:39,490
I jumped!

2521
02:35:39,890 --> 02:35:40,650
I jumped!

2522
02:35:41,150 --> 02:35:42,170
I jumped!

2523
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:49,270
Alright, let's just...

2524
02:35:50,870 --> 02:35:51,670
OK.

2525
02:35:52,290 --> 02:35:53,430
Rage quit.

2526
02:35:54,630 --> 02:35:56,670
Hey, where is the guy that usually comes out?

2527
02:35:56,910 --> 02:35:58,790
Oh, that's why.

2528
02:35:58,910 --> 02:36:00,230
Oh, I don't care about you.

2529
02:36:02,910 --> 02:36:09,430
I would much rather deal with one scissor ghost than 15 puppets.

2530
02:36:18,190 --> 02:36:20,130
Doesn't jumping have iframes in this game?

2531
02:36:20,190 --> 02:36:21,450
People are saying that.

2532
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:24,370
Wait, what's my health?

2533
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:26,330
Oh, I still have the vital star which is good.

2534
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:28,330
My health is not great.

2535
02:36:29,790 --> 02:36:31,210
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2536
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:32,430
Joy!

2537
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:34,150
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

2538
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:35,310
Thank you so much!

2539
02:36:36,590 --> 02:36:38,210
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

2540
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:40,330
Oh, magic.

2541
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:40,710
That's right.

2542
02:36:40,770 --> 02:36:41,430
I have to destroy it.

2543
02:36:42,570 --> 02:36:43,450
OK, here we go!

2544
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:45,890
Here we go!

2545
02:36:46,310 --> 02:36:47,030
Here we go!

2546
02:36:47,150 --> 02:36:47,730
Here we go!

2547
02:36:47,870 --> 02:36:48,410
Here we go!

2548
02:36:52,630 --> 02:36:53,350
Once again...

2549
02:36:53,350 --> 02:36:56,010
Oh my gosh.

2550
02:36:56,270 --> 02:36:56,470
Oh

2551
02:37:08,590 --> 02:37:09,810
shoot!

2552
02:37:09,870 --> 02:37:10,970
I didn't see where he was.

2553
02:37:12,450 --> 02:37:13,670
No, my health!

2554
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,000
We did it!

2555
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:56,810
We did it!

2556
02:37:58,590 --> 02:37:59,270
Oh

2557
02:38:09,660 --> 02:38:10,580
my gosh.

2558
02:38:11,020 --> 02:38:13,300
The game is like in love with me now.

2559
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:13,860
Real.

2560
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:14,960
Joy!

2561
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:18,400
Thank you for the pink dodo!

2562
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:19,160
Thank you!

2563
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:23,780
I joined at the seagull moment of the stream.

2564
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:40,420
Oh shoot.

2565
02:38:41,020 --> 02:38:41,280
No!

2566
02:38:41,620 --> 02:38:42,920
Don't hurt me!

2567
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:46,860
Dang it.

2568
02:38:46,900 --> 02:38:48,720
I have to do it all over again.

2569
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:57,980
I didn't know it was possible to miss that jump.

2570
02:38:58,180 --> 02:38:58,960
I'll be honest.

2571
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:10,440
You know when Squidward tells Spongebob about the hash slinging slasher and he just does the same screen ten times in a row?

2572
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:12,640
That's what you sound like.

2573
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:21,720
No, but I'm not at full health.

2574
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:23,260
This is so bad you guys.

2575
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:27,680
I'm not at my Optimus Prime.

2576
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:29,480
What do I do?

2577
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:32,620
I'm gonna die.

2578
02:39:38,850 --> 02:39:40,850
Oh gosh, just win.

2579
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:44,190
DT and you'll be good.

2580
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:44,770
OK.

2581
02:39:45,410 --> 02:39:46,010
DT.

2582
02:39:46,150 --> 02:39:46,550
DT.

2583
02:39:46,710 --> 02:39:47,090
DT.

2584
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:48,410
DT.

2585
02:39:48,590 --> 02:39:48,850
DT.

2586
02:39:48,970 --> 02:39:49,290
DT.

2587
02:39:49,370 --> 02:39:49,710
DT.

2588
02:39:49,810 --> 02:39:50,110
DT.

2589
02:39:52,530 --> 02:39:53,730
Stinger spam.

2590
02:39:54,730 --> 02:39:55,230
Yes.

2591
02:39:58,310 --> 02:40:00,010
Can I skip these?

2592
02:40:00,250 --> 02:40:00,490
No.

2593
02:40:00,650 --> 02:40:00,830
OK.

2594
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:02,270
These ones are like in game.

2595
02:40:02,470 --> 02:40:02,650
OK.

2596
02:40:03,730 --> 02:40:04,990
I can skip this.

2597
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:06,130
Alright.

2598
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:06,190
OK.

2599
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:14,640
We got so close before you guys.

2600
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:15,820
We were so close.

2601
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:18,120
We were so close.

2602
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:21,700
We were so close.

2603
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:25,020
There's orbs on the bed.

2604
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:25,580
Oh shoot.

2605
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:27,420
I forgot about getting them again.

2606
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:30,180
Can I get... Wait.

2607
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:31,760
Do I have any water left in here?

2608
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:34,760
I do.

2609
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:43,190
Save.

2610
02:40:43,310 --> 02:40:46,610
Yeah, let's save so I can save my orbs.

2611
02:40:48,150 --> 02:40:49,530
Saving the rorbs.

2612
02:40:49,690 --> 02:40:50,810
Saving the rorbs.

2613
02:40:51,530 --> 02:40:52,850
Is there a pha... OK.

2614
02:40:53,410 --> 02:40:55,910
Don't tell me where it is because obviously I can't get to it now.

2615
02:40:56,450 --> 02:41:00,250
But was there a Phantom Baby 3?

2616
02:41:01,950 --> 02:41:04,150
Was there a third Phantom Baby?

2617
02:41:05,950 --> 02:41:07,450
Solidus Phantom Baby?

2618
02:41:07,970 --> 02:41:08,450
Yes!

2619
02:41:09,130 --> 02:41:10,150
Oh my god.

2620
02:41:10,330 --> 02:41:11,790
Wait, am I getting one guide?

2621
02:41:11,890 --> 02:41:12,490
I can't tell.

2622
02:41:14,630 --> 02:41:16,330
Monthly streamer tax paid.

2623
02:41:16,770 --> 02:41:18,030
Medic, thank you!

2624
02:41:18,770 --> 02:41:19,270
Oh no.

2625
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:23,670
Is the third Phantom Baby in the room with us?

2626
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:24,290
I don't know.

2627
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:26,530
You're the Phantom Baby.

2628
02:41:28,070 --> 02:41:31,810
Your powers are still young, but one day they'll call you the drink.

2629
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:34,970
Is it because I'm a cold glass of water?

2630
02:41:36,890 --> 02:41:38,850
Les Enfants Arachnids?

2631
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:42,230
OK, I'm stalling.

2632
02:41:42,290 --> 02:41:42,870
I'm stalling.

2633
02:41:46,830 --> 02:41:49,970
I don't want to skip this because...

2634
02:41:52,050 --> 02:41:56,810
I want the... I want to have my dodge.

2635
02:41:58,010 --> 02:41:58,310
Oh

2636
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:11,020
my gosh.

2637
02:42:11,140 --> 02:42:12,220
So unfair!

2638
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:12,840
Oh shoot.

2639
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:21,080
Oh my god.

2640
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:22,760
No, guys, this is not the run.

2641
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:25,440
No, I'm already... I'm already...

2642
02:42:29,960 --> 02:42:32,740
I'm already... I'm not doing so hot.

2643
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:36,080
I'm already messing up.

2644
02:42:52,010 --> 02:42:53,930
Nothing personal, kid.

2645
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:56,110
He literally did that to me!

2646
02:43:03,810 --> 02:43:04,230
What?

2647
02:43:04,350 --> 02:43:04,570
What?

2648
02:43:05,430 --> 02:43:06,210
Oh shit.

2649
02:43:18,680 --> 02:43:19,100
Wait.

2650
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:21,620
I'm gonna use it.

2651
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:27,600
Even though I Devil Triggered, I'm gonna use it.

2652
02:43:30,480 --> 02:43:30,900
No,

2653
02:43:55,340 --> 02:43:55,640
no, no.

2654
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:56,420
Jump, jump, jump.

2655
02:43:56,860 --> 02:43:57,480
Jump, jump, jump.

2656
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:58,440
Jump, jump, jump.

2657
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:00,880
Oh my god.

2658
02:44:00,900 --> 02:44:01,420
How did he...

2659
02:44:09,070 --> 02:44:10,110
Stinger spam!

2660
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:15,530
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2661
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:29,830
Wait, I'm healing while I'm like... I thought I only healed while I took hits.

2662
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:33,030
Or while I was hitting him, but... OK.

2663
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:20,560
Yeah!

2664
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:27,860
Oh my god, we got him.

2665
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:28,680
Piss fight.

2666
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:29,040
OK.

2667
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:31,400
We hate swords now.

2668
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:33,540
Grab his hair.

2669
02:45:34,020 --> 02:45:34,960
Kiss him.

2670
02:45:35,380 --> 02:45:40,980
Oh my god.

2671
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:43,940
It's the Devil Tear.

2672
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:45,920
The Devil that cried.

2673
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:47,240
He made the tear.

2674
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:50,680
He's going sicko mode.

2675
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:03,280
I knew I was right to believe in you.

2676
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:05,840
Thank you!

2677
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:09,800
Mission clear, baby!

2678
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:14,180
Survive an encounter with Nello Angelo.

2679
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:20,500
It's OK, we're alright guys.

2680
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:21,920
D!

2681
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:24,420
D for damn!

2682
02:46:24,820 --> 02:46:26,420
That girl's got moves!

2683
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:29,040
D for Devil May Cry.

2684
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:30,400
Obviously.

2685
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:33,560
Boss bonus.

2686
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:37,740
Save, please let me save.

2687
02:46:50,370 --> 02:46:52,270
We're only on mission 5.

2688
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:57,770
Go to the destination before the power of the melancholy soul fades away.

2689
02:46:59,670 --> 02:47:02,490
To the... Minto Gaming!

2690
02:47:04,550 --> 02:47:06,610
D for do better next time.

2691
02:47:07,050 --> 02:47:12,760
Next mission is annoying.

2692
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:13,800
Is it a timed mission?

2693
02:47:15,180 --> 02:47:16,640
There's only 23 missions.

2694
02:47:16,980 --> 02:47:17,180
Yeah!

2695
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:22,140
5, 10, 15, 20.

2696
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:23,100
Oh, I guess...

2697
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:25,600
25.

2698
02:47:25,900 --> 02:47:26,160
Wait.

2699
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:27,840
So we're like... Oh, OK.

2700
02:47:28,660 --> 02:47:30,020
It is...

2701
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:36,540
But I can just drop to the bottom, right?

2702
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:40,800
Let me just try it.

2703
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:44,560
Let's just try it and see before I try and buy...

2704
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:46,480
Melancholy soul!

2705
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:48,980
Yes, that's you.

2706
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:52,380
Oh no.

2707
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:53,080
No!

2708
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:42,820
Don't go away!

2709
02:48:43,820 --> 02:48:45,800
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

2710
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:54,680
Are these guys gonna end up becoming a regular enemy?

2711
02:48:55,800 --> 02:48:56,760
How icky.

2712
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:57,580
If so...

2713
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:00,240
Oh my god, please.

2714
02:49:00,660 --> 02:49:01,860
He has 1 HP, I think.

2715
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:08,840
Oh my god.

2716
02:49:09,280 --> 02:49:10,480
You ass.

2717
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:17,600
OK.

2718
02:49:17,940 --> 02:49:20,400
How do I get up there?

2719
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:22,940
And then...

2720
02:49:23,580 --> 02:49:23,940
Nope.

2721
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:25,620
How did I get up there?

2722
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:26,880
How did I... Oh shoot.

2723
02:49:27,220 --> 02:49:27,440
Wait.

2724
02:49:27,820 --> 02:49:28,680
I did it before.

2725
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:29,840
No.

2726
02:49:30,700 --> 02:49:31,140
Oh no.

2727
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:31,860
Wait.

2728
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:32,880
Oh god.

2729
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:46,100
From here maybe?

2730
02:49:47,480 --> 02:49:48,400
What the hell?

2731
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:54,820
Stinger?

2732
02:50:01,350 --> 02:50:02,370
Dante?

2733
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:12,060
Dante!

2734
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:15,180
Just a second.

2735
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:16,120
From here?

2736
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:17,920
I can't jump.

2737
02:50:18,220 --> 02:50:19,720
There is a ceiling.

2738
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:26,180
Maybe from here?

2739
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:27,640
Oh.

2740
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:28,200
Nope.

2741
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:28,640
Nope.

2742
02:50:35,370 --> 02:50:36,790
I'm not panicking.

2743
02:50:36,930 --> 02:50:37,710
You're panicking.

2744
02:50:37,890 --> 02:50:40,270
You're the one typing in all caps in my chat.

2745
02:50:42,330 --> 02:50:43,930
Oh here it is.

2746
02:50:46,930 --> 02:50:48,150
Let's go there.

2747
02:50:51,950 --> 02:50:52,550
What

2748
02:50:56,990 --> 02:50:58,190
if I just run?

2749
02:51:03,370 --> 02:51:04,230
See guys?

2750
02:51:04,290 --> 02:51:05,550
I made it.

2751
02:51:13,050 --> 02:51:14,010
B!

2752
02:51:19,250 --> 02:51:20,350
I got a B.

2753
02:51:28,050 --> 02:51:30,030
For believe in Minto.

2754
02:51:30,710 --> 02:51:31,150
Duh.

2755
02:51:32,790 --> 02:51:34,250
B for believe.

2756
02:51:38,470 --> 02:51:40,210
B for believe.

2757
02:51:43,490 --> 02:51:44,130
Spieve.

2758
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:46,790
Evil of the waterways.

2759
02:51:47,630 --> 02:51:49,050
Defeat the light guardian... Oh sorry.

2760
02:51:49,150 --> 02:51:51,950
The evil guardian and acquire the guiding light.

2761
02:51:52,630 --> 02:51:56,410
That's what will be... That's what the sun said.

2762
02:51:58,090 --> 02:51:59,610
Evil... Is this a boss fight?

2763
02:51:59,730 --> 02:52:00,670
Another boss fight?

2764
02:52:01,570 --> 02:52:02,150
Okay.

2765
02:52:03,130 --> 02:52:07,650
We're waiting for the... We're waiting for... What was it on here?

2766
02:52:08,250 --> 02:52:08,670
Okay.

2767
02:52:11,730 --> 02:52:13,770
It won't even let me go past stinger level 2.

2768
02:52:14,110 --> 02:52:15,210
Do I have to like unlock it?

2769
02:52:16,690 --> 02:52:16,970
Okay.

2770
02:52:17,090 --> 02:52:19,330
I gotta save up for the air hike.

2771
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:23,690
Sub boss and it's annoying as shadow.

2772
02:52:24,690 --> 02:52:25,550
Got it.

2773
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:28,210
The shadow of the pupper.

2774
02:52:29,070 --> 02:52:29,730
The little dog.

2775
02:52:36,690 --> 02:52:37,250
Creepy.

2776
02:52:41,460 --> 02:52:42,580
Which way...

2777
02:52:42,580 --> 02:52:43,960
Shall I go...

2778
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:43,960
Oh!

2779
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:45,680
Okay!

2780
02:52:46,440 --> 02:52:46,980
Thanks for the hurricane.

2781
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:48,740
I've been without running water for two days now.

2782
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:50,040
Binary!

2783
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:53,200
I'm getting sticky but I think my cat respects me more now.

2784
02:52:54,260 --> 02:52:56,140
I'm glad you're safe though.

2785
02:52:57,820 --> 02:52:59,460
I'm glad you're safe.

2786
02:53:01,060 --> 02:53:02,120
You and your kitty.

2787
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:09,860
Oh.

2788
02:53:10,380 --> 02:53:11,440
Wait, do I need this?

2789
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:12,320
What's my health at?

2790
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:14,900
Oh!

2791
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:15,860
I'll take it.

2792
02:53:15,900 --> 02:53:16,400
Oh, what's this?

2793
02:53:30,410 --> 02:53:31,790
It's raining rorbs.

2794
02:53:32,290 --> 02:53:33,510
I'm gonna save after that.

2795
02:53:36,710 --> 02:53:38,090
I'm gonna save after that.

2796
02:53:38,690 --> 02:53:42,450
Why does it zoom in after every... I thought it was about to explode because it kept zooming in on me.

2797
02:53:42,930 --> 02:53:44,470
I was like, I'm about to die.

2798
02:53:44,530 --> 02:53:45,490
It's a trap.

2799
02:53:45,590 --> 02:53:45,970
It's a secret.

2800
02:53:46,110 --> 02:53:46,890
It's like...

2801
02:53:46,890 --> 02:53:49,370
I wasn't supposed to be doing this.

2802
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:51,110
Can I go into the hole?

2803
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:54,170
I can jump on top of it.

2804
02:53:56,730 --> 02:53:59,010
I'm exploring for now, guys.

2805
02:53:59,330 --> 02:54:02,430
I know there's a door there in case you're like, hey, my dog!

2806
02:54:03,210 --> 02:54:04,070
Go through the door.

2807
02:54:05,570 --> 02:54:06,050
Alright.

2808
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:08,190
Yeah, stay safe though.

2809
02:54:08,310 --> 02:54:09,370
Oh, the door is locked up.

2810
02:54:09,410 --> 02:54:09,690
Rusty.

2811
02:54:09,850 --> 02:54:11,390
It's always a rusty key.

2812
02:54:13,030 --> 02:54:14,890
Why doesn't this place take care of their keys?

2813
02:54:25,690 --> 02:54:26,570
What are these?

2814
02:54:27,690 --> 02:54:29,070
That's wood.

2815
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:35,840
Are things gonna start coming out of the holes?

2816
02:54:36,660 --> 02:54:37,180
Oh boy.

2817
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:38,760
Oh wow.

2818
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:40,200
There's a lot of holes in this room.

2819
02:54:40,380 --> 02:54:41,660
Oh, is this the guy?

2820
02:54:41,900 --> 02:54:42,120
Okay.

2821
02:54:45,380 --> 02:54:47,040
That looks like a rusty key.

2822
02:55:03,940 --> 02:55:04,860
I'm styling.

2823
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:07,880
How do I...

2824
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:10,580
Grab it, Dante.

2825
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:11,680
Grab it.

2826
02:55:13,560 --> 02:55:14,040
Dante?

2827
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:17,100
Am I supposed to press B?

2828
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:17,920
Just...

2829
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:20,080
That doesn't work.

2830
02:55:21,820 --> 02:55:22,660
Oh, there we go.

2831
02:55:22,700 --> 02:55:23,620
I just have to get closer.

2832
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:25,420
The key is rusty.

2833
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:27,320
Who would have thought?

2834
02:55:29,060 --> 02:55:29,540
Gross!

2835
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:34,580
The devil is crying.

2836
02:55:34,740 --> 02:55:35,860
I'm crying right now.

2837
02:55:46,220 --> 02:55:46,460
Ew!

2838
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:52,780
Oh

2839
02:55:56,840 --> 02:55:57,900
my gosh.

2840
02:55:58,780 --> 02:55:59,560
Gross!

2841
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:01,980
Come down here, you coward!

2842
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:13,500
I think I got him.

2843
02:56:19,820 --> 02:56:22,360
Ew, they even turned into maggots.

2844
02:56:28,330 --> 02:56:29,110
Nice.

2845
02:56:35,620 --> 02:56:36,800
Matara's cousins.

2846
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:45,820
I wondered why there wasn't anything in here before.

2847
02:56:56,350 --> 02:56:56,870
Nice.

2848
02:56:57,130 --> 02:56:57,910
At least they heal.

2849
02:56:58,910 --> 02:57:00,070
Okay, rusty key time.

2850
02:57:01,430 --> 02:57:02,450
Wait, is there more?

2851
02:57:03,230 --> 02:57:03,510
No.

2852
02:57:06,820 --> 02:57:08,240
Alright, before we go in here...

2853
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:09,380
Oh, wrong.

2854
02:57:10,480 --> 02:57:11,840
Save the game.

2855
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:13,860
Save.

2856
02:57:13,960 --> 02:57:14,280
Complete.

2857
02:57:16,380 --> 02:57:16,920
Let's go.

2858
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:18,940
We use the rusty key.

2859
02:57:28,740 --> 02:57:29,200
Okay.

2860
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:30,800
That looks...

2861
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:33,100
That looks like it could be blown up.

2862
02:57:36,260 --> 02:57:38,000
They dropped a fair amount of rorbs.

2863
02:57:39,160 --> 02:57:39,620
Awesome.

2864
02:57:40,360 --> 02:57:41,320
My favorite thing to eat.

2865
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:42,620
Rorbs.

2866
02:57:42,880 --> 02:57:43,850
Video games made me think...

2867
02:57:44,740 --> 02:57:47,180
That I would be going into sewers way more in my life.

2868
02:57:55,240 --> 02:57:56,400
You don't go into sewers?

2869
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:01,220
You don't go into sewers?

2870
02:58:04,500 --> 02:58:06,080
I think you're the weird one.

2871
02:58:09,060 --> 02:58:10,960
All my homies go into sewers.

2872
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:11,620
What are these?

2873
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:20,540
This looks like something I shouldn't stand in the middle of.

2874
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:23,260
I'm going to go around it.

2875
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:25,100
Just kidding.

2876
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:26,680
It's the guy!

2877
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:29,620
He's got big ol' scissors.

2878
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:47,560
Let's try... I don't even know what the strat is here.

2879
02:59:48,180 --> 02:59:49,400
Just dodge, I guess?

2880
02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:53,120
I'm going to die.

2881
02:59:53,240 --> 02:59:53,720
I'm going to die.

2882
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:06,460
Shit.

2883
03:00:16,060 --> 03:00:17,840
I could double trigger again.

2884
03:00:18,100 --> 03:00:20,920
I was trying to earlier, but it wouldn't let me.

2885
03:00:21,140 --> 03:00:22,160
It wasn't recharged.

2886
03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:25,060
It wasn't recharged.

2887
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:33,760
I did try though.

2888
03:00:33,940 --> 03:00:36,640
I wasn't not trying to double trigger.

2889
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:39,360
But now I know I can't also hit him with...

2890
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:42,120
Or I could hit him with my sword, but it was way easier to just shoot him.

2891
03:00:48,820 --> 03:00:49,760
Using pistol?

2892
03:00:49,900 --> 03:00:51,680
Best against him?

2893
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:52,320
Oh, is it?

2894
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:53,380
Okay, let's try that.

2895
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:56,340
Actually, it probably would be good against the...

2896
03:00:57,740 --> 03:00:59,880
The little flies too, huh?

2897
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:03,700
Maybe, because they're faster, right?

2898
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:07,100
Let's try it.

2899
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:10,860
Ebony and ivory!

2900
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:12,280
Oh, I got this already.

2901
03:01:15,980 --> 03:01:20,680
We know you tried, it's just that Summachat forgot DT needs at least 3 full symbols to be activated.

2902
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:24,480
And I think it happened like right at the end, so...

2903
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:27,420
That's okay, I can get more stuff.

2904
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:30,280
Oh wait, before we do that...

2905
03:01:34,600 --> 03:01:35,680
Can I farm here?

2906
03:01:45,660 --> 03:01:47,060
I'm meat, the rorbs!

2907
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:48,640
I'm hungry for the rorbs!

2908
03:01:49,160 --> 03:01:51,660
I'm hungry, I'm starving for the rorbs!

2909
03:01:52,600 --> 03:01:53,740
We're doing good though.

2910
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:54,520
Thank you!

2911
03:01:56,780 --> 03:02:00,880
Taunting can raise... Taunting can raise devil trigger?

2912
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:01,440
Really?

2913
03:02:29,160 --> 03:02:29,720
I

2914
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:42,400
know I shouldn't only be using my gun.

2915
03:02:52,930 --> 03:02:53,930
Or did I get him?

2916
03:03:00,170 --> 03:03:01,090
Oh my god!

2917
03:03:01,530 --> 03:03:02,070
Die!

2918
03:03:16,340 --> 03:03:17,380
The dude was zooming.

2919
03:03:18,900 --> 03:03:19,880
How did I get there?

2920
03:03:19,940 --> 03:03:20,820
Who ate a key?

2921
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:25,720
Oh my gosh!

2922
03:03:27,640 --> 03:03:29,740
Are they riding on top of each other?

2923
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:33,280
What do you mean?

2924
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:33,860
Duh!

2925
03:03:34,820 --> 03:03:36,220
It's such a cool move!

2926
03:03:36,340 --> 03:03:37,140
What are you talking about?

2927
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:40,000
There's a guy on the wall!

2928
03:04:00,980 --> 03:04:02,100
Look at them go!

2929
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:32,000
Where is he?

2930
03:04:32,180 --> 03:04:33,860
I saw one last guy.

2931
03:04:34,500 --> 03:04:36,920
Just kidding, I didn't see one last guy.

2932
03:04:40,040 --> 03:04:41,760
I am a liar.

2933
03:04:55,700 --> 03:04:58,060
Always save to keep the rorbs.

2934
03:04:58,600 --> 03:05:00,000
How many rorbs am I at anyway?

2935
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:01,280
Let's see.

2936
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:01,500
Oh!

2937
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:02,080
1,300.

2938
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:07,700
We're gonna be so close...

2939
03:05:11,100 --> 03:05:11,700
to...

2940
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:12,600
4,000.

2941
03:05:13,220 --> 03:05:14,120
Any day now.

2942
03:05:16,220 --> 03:05:20,400
We're gonna be at 4,000 any day now guys.

2943
03:05:21,100 --> 03:05:22,220
I'll get double jump real.

2944
03:05:32,500 --> 03:05:34,740
Should I save those for after the fight?

2945
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:45,600
Chewing through this game way better than most I've seen.

2946
03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:51,900
I'm only on mission 6.

2947
03:05:52,240 --> 03:05:53,580
And it's been 3 hours.

2948
03:05:58,080 --> 03:05:59,440
Wait, I'm just...

2949
03:06:00,520 --> 03:06:02,440
Ok, here we go.

2950
03:06:11,130 --> 03:06:12,010
Oh gosh!

2951
03:06:29,220 --> 03:06:29,640
Oh shoot!

2952
03:06:40,860 --> 03:06:41,340
Shoot!

2953
03:06:41,560 --> 03:06:41,560
Shoot!

2954
03:06:41,660 --> 03:06:41,740
Shoot!

2955
03:06:41,940 --> 03:06:42,660
I tried to dodge!

2956
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:48,440
Oh my gosh!

2957
03:06:58,180 --> 03:06:59,620
Move out of the way Dante!

2958
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:03,960
Oh my gosh, it's so unfair!

2959
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,860
Oh my god, please.

2960
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:12,620
Ok, so when he swings I need to jump.

2961
03:07:14,360 --> 03:07:15,720
Guys, I don't think this is it.

2962
03:07:17,140 --> 03:07:18,880
Unless I... Oh no, I can't jump!

2963
03:07:19,020 --> 03:07:19,680
Oh my god.

2964
03:07:33,330 --> 03:07:34,510
Dies of cringe.

2965
03:07:36,330 --> 03:07:37,110
So true.

2966
03:07:43,110 --> 03:07:43,810
It's ok.

2967
03:07:45,450 --> 03:07:48,690
Every time I grow stronger and also get more orbs.

2968
03:07:49,190 --> 03:07:51,830
So we're closer to the air hike, which I don't...

2969
03:07:51,830 --> 03:07:55,790
I don't even know if that would be worth it in this battle.

2970
03:07:56,130 --> 03:07:57,650
This battle is so tight.

2971
03:07:58,890 --> 03:08:00,350
Why is it so tight?

2972
03:08:05,050 --> 03:08:05,810
Air hike?

2973
03:08:06,890 --> 03:08:07,630
Oh, wrong way.

2974
03:08:09,750 --> 03:08:12,270
Super here for your battlemate training arc.

2975
03:08:12,350 --> 03:08:13,470
Thank you!

2976
03:08:21,140 --> 03:08:21,540
Freezing?

2977
03:08:21,620 --> 03:08:22,620
What did I say?

2978
03:08:23,740 --> 03:08:24,860
What did I say?

2979
03:08:28,380 --> 03:08:29,260
What did I say?

2980
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:29,900
What did I say?

2981
03:08:29,980 --> 03:08:30,560
What did I say?

2982
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:31,360
What did I say?

2983
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:35,600
Gross!

2984
03:08:36,640 --> 03:08:37,640
I hate these eyes!

2985
03:08:37,720 --> 03:08:38,020
Oh my god.

2986
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:40,280
Oh, what the hell?

2987
03:08:40,460 --> 03:08:41,080
Oh my god.

2988
03:08:41,080 --> 03:08:43,880
What is going... Why am I getting... Why am I taking so much damage?

2989
03:08:48,500 --> 03:08:50,000
Fine, I'll blow you up!

2990
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:51,520
Fine, is that what you wanted?

2991
03:09:00,980 --> 03:09:02,000
Oh my gosh.

2992
03:09:02,720 --> 03:09:05,040
I was not this bad at these guys before.

2993
03:09:05,180 --> 03:09:05,800
Oh my god.

2994
03:09:06,420 --> 03:09:06,860
What happened?

2995
03:09:06,980 --> 03:09:07,560
I'm regressing.

2996
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:26,060
I saw him on the...

2997
03:09:28,340 --> 03:09:29,260
Come here.

2998
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:32,520
Actually, I'll just do that.

2999
03:09:39,180 --> 03:09:40,480
Oh man!

3000
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:45,740
Different gun.

3001
03:09:48,100 --> 03:09:51,380
Actually, the shotgun is kind of good against them.

3002
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:19,700
Can I farm health?

3003
03:10:22,180 --> 03:10:23,600
Doesn't seem to be the case.

3004
03:10:24,140 --> 03:10:24,680
Six months?

3005
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:26,200
Thanks for sticking around me though!

3006
03:10:27,140 --> 03:10:28,460
Superion, thank you!

3007
03:10:28,640 --> 03:10:31,580
Thanks for sticking around as well for six whole months.

3008
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:32,820
I really appreciate it.

3009
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:34,900
I see him.

3010
03:10:37,120 --> 03:10:37,680
Sniped.

3011
03:10:39,300 --> 03:10:40,500
Wait, is there anyone else?

3012
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:43,740
I think that was the only guy.

3013
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:47,320
It's been a wonderful half a year for me too.

3014
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:49,020
Thank you for the signal!

3015
03:10:49,380 --> 03:10:50,260
Welcome to the membership!

3016
03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:52,120
Evan, thank you for six months.

3017
03:10:52,220 --> 03:10:53,060
Thank you guys!

3018
03:10:54,360 --> 03:10:55,740
My health is not...

3019
03:10:59,340 --> 03:11:00,900
But we can get health here.

3020
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:02,300
At least.

3021
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:04,620
Oh wait, I forgot to save.

3022
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:13,920
I'm here for break stuff and Mata.

3023
03:11:15,120 --> 03:11:16,520
Go get them ghosts!

3024
03:11:16,680 --> 03:11:17,140
You got this!

3025
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:18,380
Thank you!

3026
03:11:18,900 --> 03:11:19,680
From Mata.

3027
03:11:19,920 --> 03:11:24,100
Tell her she's really stinky.

3028
03:11:28,930 --> 03:11:29,830
Break stuff.

3029
03:11:33,140 --> 03:11:37,760
There may be a break stuff performance in the future.

3030
03:11:38,380 --> 03:11:39,760
In the near future even.

3031
03:11:41,280 --> 03:11:43,440
OK, so next gun.

3032
03:11:44,480 --> 03:11:45,400
Other gun, other gun.

3033
03:11:45,400 --> 03:11:47,840
Happy six months with me dog!

3034
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:48,600
Get crowded!

3035
03:11:49,440 --> 03:11:50,320
Thank you!

3036
03:11:52,380 --> 03:11:54,820
Thank you, thank you.

3037
03:12:03,280 --> 03:12:03,920
OK.

3038
03:12:05,860 --> 03:12:06,840
I'll pack a change.

3039
03:12:07,740 --> 03:12:09,000
Six months party.

3040
03:12:10,120 --> 03:12:11,800
Suddenly it's a six months party.

3041
03:12:11,900 --> 03:12:12,500
Thank you guys!

3042
03:12:12,680 --> 03:12:13,200
Thank you!

3043
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:14,540
Alright.

3044
03:12:15,020 --> 03:12:16,480
I'm starting to get sleepy.

3045
03:12:16,480 --> 03:12:19,740
So I think after, once we beat this guy, hopefully we beat him soon.

3046
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:20,940
Hopefully.

3047
03:12:21,960 --> 03:12:23,120
Hopefully we beat him soon.

3048
03:12:24,080 --> 03:12:26,220
You guys weren't kidding when he's annoying.

3049
03:12:28,980 --> 03:12:30,980
When it's lower ground he can melee it.

3050
03:12:39,370 --> 03:12:40,750
Oh my gosh!

3051
03:12:45,440 --> 03:12:46,160
Oh my gosh!

3052
03:12:46,220 --> 03:12:46,460
Ouch!

3053
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:50,380
Oh my god.

3054
03:12:50,540 --> 03:12:51,700
Guys, this is not the run.

3055
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:53,100
Guys, this is... Oh my god.

3056
03:12:53,240 --> 03:12:54,640
You guys, this is so bad.

3057
03:12:57,960 --> 03:12:58,820
What the fuck?

3058
03:12:58,960 --> 03:12:59,680
What is happening?

3059
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:03,700
I give up.

3060
03:13:03,740 --> 03:13:04,300
I give up.

3061
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:05,620
What is happening?

3062
03:13:05,900 --> 03:13:06,620
What is happening?

3063
03:13:07,500 --> 03:13:07,900
Why?

3064
03:13:08,100 --> 03:13:09,420
This run is so cursed.

3065
03:13:09,500 --> 03:13:11,500
First it was the bugs, now it's this guy.

3066
03:13:11,580 --> 03:13:12,320
What the hell?

3067
03:13:14,320 --> 03:13:16,120
I'm so annoyed right now.

3068
03:13:18,520 --> 03:13:20,020
What the hell?

3069
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:30,120
I was...

3070
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:31,020
Oh my gosh.

3071
03:13:31,060 --> 03:13:31,800
I keep going the wrong way.

3072
03:13:31,860 --> 03:13:34,920
I was so bad through this whole run.

3073
03:13:38,580 --> 03:13:40,180
Maybe it's because I'm hungry.

3074
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:42,680
That's why I'm regressing.

3075
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:45,340
Ok.

3076
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:47,140
That is equipped now, right?

3077
03:13:47,920 --> 03:13:48,080
Ok.

3078
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:48,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3079
03:13:50,120 --> 03:13:51,580
6 months part wait.

3080
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:04,000
DMC1 experience?

3081
03:14:04,200 --> 03:14:04,420
Ok.

3082
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:07,240
Thank you for being here, Minto.

3083
03:14:07,440 --> 03:14:08,360
Thank you!

3084
03:14:12,580 --> 03:14:13,700
Get out of here.

3085
03:14:13,820 --> 03:14:14,360
Get out of here.

3086
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:14,400
Get out of here.

3087
03:14:16,920 --> 03:14:19,860
I'm just gonna start blasting away, baby.

3088
03:14:20,340 --> 03:14:23,120
Oh my gosh.

3089
03:14:23,220 --> 03:14:23,800
Ok, ok, ok.

3090
03:14:58,920 --> 03:14:59,840
Oh, I did it.

3091
03:15:03,490 --> 03:15:05,110
Minto playing hollow cure out here.

3092
03:15:05,190 --> 03:15:06,550
I wish I was playing hollow cure.

3093
03:15:10,070 --> 03:15:14,270
I play... I try to play a little bit everyday.

3094
03:15:15,370 --> 03:15:17,610
Wait, where is my... I lost the glorb.

3095
03:15:17,610 --> 03:15:18,290
No!

3096
03:15:23,480 --> 03:15:24,280
It's ok.

3097
03:15:25,320 --> 03:15:26,200
We'll get a new one.

3098
03:15:26,840 --> 03:15:28,160
Spam those bullets like tuba.

3099
03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:33,120
Take

3100
03:15:36,320 --> 03:15:38,120
their butts down.

3101
03:15:38,700 --> 03:15:39,980
Take their butts down.

3102
03:15:45,100 --> 03:15:46,520
I don't realize I'm killing them.

3103
03:16:03,170 --> 03:16:05,450
Half a year really flew by.

3104
03:16:06,010 --> 03:16:06,470
I know.

3105
03:16:07,410 --> 03:16:08,770
I can't believe half a year.

3106
03:16:10,450 --> 03:16:13,670
It's been only... It's half a year since I opened memberships.

3107
03:16:13,730 --> 03:16:14,270
I don't remember.

3108
03:16:14,530 --> 03:16:17,470
I had to wait a bit before I got memberships, right?

3109
03:16:28,670 --> 03:16:29,590
What's my health at?

3110
03:16:29,690 --> 03:16:30,250
Oh, we're full.

3111
03:16:30,530 --> 03:16:30,690
Ok.

3112
03:16:36,530 --> 03:16:36,970
Alright.

3113
03:16:41,770 --> 03:16:42,570
I'm nervous.

3114
03:16:46,370 --> 03:16:47,090
I'm nervous.

3115
03:16:47,470 --> 03:16:48,130
Look at him go.

3116
03:16:51,430 --> 03:16:52,670
I found out how to send one of these.

3117
03:16:52,750 --> 03:16:53,130
Go, mate!

3118
03:16:53,650 --> 03:16:54,450
Thanks, Scorcher!

3119
03:16:56,890 --> 03:16:58,850
Hitting his head with a sword deals more damage.

3120
03:16:59,210 --> 03:17:00,490
If I can get in there.

3121
03:17:07,180 --> 03:17:07,540
Alright.

3122
03:17:08,860 --> 03:17:09,920
I'm sleepy-eepy.

3123
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:14,340
For those wondering, too...

3124
03:17:15,680 --> 03:17:16,160
Tomorrow...

3125
03:17:17,720 --> 03:17:19,620
Tomorrow, Snake Eater will not happen.

3126
03:17:20,220 --> 03:17:21,220
I'm gonna reschedule it.

3127
03:17:21,280 --> 03:17:21,540
Sorry.

3128
03:17:23,140 --> 03:17:25,920
Because my schedule for VMuse is a little crazy.

3129
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:29,480
Ok.

3130
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:34,800
I'll post about it, though.

3131
03:17:35,140 --> 03:17:37,620
I'll post the waiting room so you guys know in advance, too.

3132
03:17:37,620 --> 03:17:38,960
When it will be instead.

3133
03:17:53,590 --> 03:17:55,860
How am I supposed to avoid this?

3134
03:18:32,230 --> 03:18:32,950
Go

3135
03:19:51,880 --> 03:19:52,900
in the wall, you cheater!

3136
03:19:56,200 --> 03:19:57,640
Double trigger!

3137
03:19:58,300 --> 03:19:58,300
Double trigger!

3138
03:19:58,300 --> 03:19:58,700
Double trigger!

3139
03:20:03,780 --> 03:20:04,960
Why won't it let me?

3140
03:20:05,900 --> 03:20:07,140
Please, please, Taka.

3141
03:20:14,220 --> 03:20:15,800
Why won't it let me?

3142
03:20:20,860 --> 03:20:23,420
Why won't it let me?

3143
03:20:26,180 --> 03:20:28,280
Why won't it let me do it?

3144
03:20:28,340 --> 03:20:30,100
My double trigger was on 3!

3145
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:41,160
It wasn't fully.

3146
03:20:53,620 --> 03:20:55,400
It looks so close, too.

3147
03:20:57,080 --> 03:20:57,620
Ok,

3148
03:21:01,360 --> 03:21:01,680
guys.

3149
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:02,480
One more try.

3150
03:21:02,680 --> 03:21:03,860
I do this every time.

3151
03:21:04,240 --> 03:21:06,720
One more try and then I'm gonna call it.

3152
03:21:06,840 --> 03:21:08,300
We'll do it next time.

3153
03:21:09,800 --> 03:21:12,440
One more try and then I'm gonna call it.

3154
03:21:12,540 --> 03:21:15,640
Because I really am starting to get sleepy.

3155
03:21:17,520 --> 03:21:18,680
Wait, what do I have on?

3156
03:21:30,950 --> 03:21:34,170
I don't feel confident using my sword in it.

3157
03:21:34,290 --> 03:21:36,790
Because it's hard to get him.

3158
03:21:36,870 --> 03:21:37,650
Because he's flying.

3159
03:21:37,810 --> 03:21:39,650
Maybe if I try with these guys.

3160
03:21:39,770 --> 03:21:41,090
Because they're also flying around.

3161
03:21:41,170 --> 03:21:46,350
But it's such a tight spot that I don't feel confident using my sword with him.

3162
03:21:46,350 --> 03:21:46,650
You know?

3163
03:21:50,170 --> 03:21:52,350
I'd rather just...

3164
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:20,040
Why are you doing that?

3165
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:26,140
Ouch!

3166
03:22:27,020 --> 03:22:28,420
Stop it!

3167
03:22:42,620 --> 03:22:44,620
Why are you so beefy this one time?

3168
03:22:52,040 --> 03:22:54,020
Guns deal too low damage?

3169
03:22:54,400 --> 03:22:55,840
Is that really the case?

3170
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:11,920
Holy shoot!

3171
03:23:12,380 --> 03:23:13,460
That was so awesome.

3172
03:23:37,680 --> 03:23:39,840
Combo extenders not damage dealers.

3173
03:23:40,540 --> 03:23:41,220
What do I hear?

3174
03:23:42,240 --> 03:23:42,980
Is it behind me?

3175
03:23:55,320 --> 03:23:57,760
Okay, I'll try to use my sword more this time.

3176
03:24:05,400 --> 03:24:07,140
At least I'll... I always do this.

3177
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:10,360
At least I'm kind of getting more...

3178
03:24:11,160 --> 03:24:12,140
Rorbs, I guess.

3179
03:24:12,300 --> 03:24:12,960
What am I at?

3180
03:24:13,320 --> 03:24:13,680
1500?

3181
03:24:14,100 --> 03:24:14,460
Okay.

3182
03:24:19,240 --> 03:24:20,200
We believe in you, man.

3183
03:24:20,340 --> 03:24:20,780
Thank you!

3184
03:24:20,940 --> 03:24:22,300
Thank you!

3185
03:24:23,680 --> 03:24:24,840
Nah, you guys are good.

3186
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:25,680
You guys are...

3187
03:24:27,580 --> 03:24:28,300
Being nice.

3188
03:24:28,500 --> 03:24:29,460
You're just trying to help out.

3189
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:30,020
I get it.

3190
03:24:31,780 --> 03:24:34,160
It's me being stubborn and wanting to use my guns.

3191
03:24:36,720 --> 03:24:38,540
It's me being stubborn and wanting to...

3192
03:24:38,540 --> 03:24:39,600
Look at how cool...

3193
03:24:39,600 --> 03:24:42,600
Why wouldn't I want to use my guns when that's what he does?

3194
03:24:44,820 --> 03:24:45,240
Alrighty.

3195
03:24:46,960 --> 03:24:47,800
Alright, sword.

3196
03:24:48,660 --> 03:24:50,220
Also, let me turn off my fan.

3197
03:24:50,920 --> 03:24:53,140
My contacts are starting to dry up.

3198
03:24:56,020 --> 03:24:56,800
Oh my gosh.

3199
03:24:57,180 --> 03:25:02,980
I decorated my fan earlier with some stickers and I forgot I did so and I looked at it and I was like...

3200
03:25:03,640 --> 03:25:04,440
Oh my god.

3201
03:25:04,540 --> 03:25:05,420
What's wrong with my fan?

3202
03:25:06,820 --> 03:25:07,840
Hold on.

3203
03:25:08,140 --> 03:25:08,840
Oh my gosh.

3204
03:25:08,900 --> 03:25:10,000
These contacts suck.

3205
03:25:10,300 --> 03:25:11,600
I got them...

3206
03:25:11,600 --> 03:25:12,580
They're like...

3207
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:13,600
You can't really tell.

3208
03:25:14,500 --> 03:25:16,360
Because they're still blue.

3209
03:25:16,860 --> 03:25:18,660
But their color contacts...

3210
03:25:18,660 --> 03:25:18,980
I don't know.

3211
03:25:19,040 --> 03:25:19,420
Can you tell?

3212
03:25:19,500 --> 03:25:20,420
Did my eyes look different today?

3213
03:25:21,600 --> 03:25:25,820
But their color contacts that I got in Japan...

3214
03:25:25,820 --> 03:25:26,420
But like...

3215
03:25:28,620 --> 03:25:29,220
They...

3216
03:25:29,220 --> 03:25:31,640
They are so awful.

3217
03:25:31,760 --> 03:25:32,980
They dry up so quickly.

3218
03:25:33,820 --> 03:25:34,800
Yeah, we can tell.

3219
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:36,320
Yeah, you can tell.

3220
03:25:42,160 --> 03:25:42,600
So...

3221
03:25:42,600 --> 03:25:44,100
Shotgun can do damage.

3222
03:25:44,200 --> 03:25:47,780
Wait, but people were telling me before to use these guns instead.

3223
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:50,480
Mental love as always.

3224
03:25:51,440 --> 03:25:54,160
But even the other day I was wearing these contacts.

3225
03:25:54,240 --> 03:25:56,400
I'm just using them because I'm trying to get rid of them.

3226
03:25:56,800 --> 03:25:57,440
Like I was like...

3227
03:25:57,440 --> 03:25:58,220
Oh, I paid for them.

3228
03:25:58,260 --> 03:25:59,040
I might as well...

3229
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:00,520
I might as well wear them.

3230
03:26:02,180 --> 03:26:02,620
And...

3231
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:04,260
I went to the store.

3232
03:26:04,880 --> 03:26:07,080
And I rubbed my eye.

3233
03:26:07,580 --> 03:26:08,840
And one of them came out!

3234
03:26:09,620 --> 03:26:10,280
I was like...

3235
03:26:10,280 --> 03:26:13,540
I had to go to the bathroom and put it back in.

3236
03:26:13,620 --> 03:26:15,360
And it was barely...

3237
03:26:15,360 --> 03:26:17,160
Oh my gosh, it was so dried up.

3238
03:26:17,180 --> 03:26:18,400
I could barely put it back in.

3239
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:21,940
I had to go home and immediately take it out.

3240
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:23,020
It was so bad.

3241
03:26:25,420 --> 03:26:26,380
Minto has special eyes.

3242
03:26:26,460 --> 03:26:28,940
Yeah, it's like an anime girl thing, you know?

3243
03:26:28,940 --> 03:26:29,760
Like...

3244
03:26:29,760 --> 03:26:32,600
My eyes are so big that contacts don't stay in them very well.

3245
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:33,780
So...

3246
03:26:33,780 --> 03:26:34,240
Yeah.

3247
03:26:46,810 --> 03:26:48,430
Should I switch to shotgun then?

3248
03:26:48,490 --> 03:26:48,710
Maybe.

3249
03:26:49,410 --> 03:26:51,190
Maybe if I'm gonna focus more on...

3250
03:26:51,590 --> 03:26:53,710
Okay, I'm gonna switch to shotgun.

3251
03:26:55,150 --> 03:26:59,010
If I'm gonna try and focus more on the sword...

3252
03:27:01,030 --> 03:27:01,470
Because...

3253
03:27:01,470 --> 03:27:02,330
Then I won't be like...

3254
03:27:02,330 --> 03:27:02,850
Pew, pew, pew!

3255
03:27:02,950 --> 03:27:03,530
I'll be like...

3256
03:27:03,530 --> 03:27:03,790
Pew!

3257
03:27:04,530 --> 03:27:04,970
Pew!

3258
03:27:08,010 --> 03:27:09,070
Look at this.

3259
03:27:09,530 --> 03:27:10,130
Dante, hold on.

3260
03:27:10,170 --> 03:27:10,690
Turn around, Dante.

3261
03:27:11,530 --> 03:27:12,250
Do your thing.

3262
03:27:13,430 --> 03:27:14,050
Do your thing.

3263
03:27:18,710 --> 03:27:20,630
Oh my god, not that hand in the...

3264
03:27:20,630 --> 03:27:22,370
Oh my gosh, he's got like...

3265
03:27:22,370 --> 03:27:22,990
He's got a...

3266
03:27:22,990 --> 03:27:24,430
He's tilting his knee in.

3267
03:27:24,470 --> 03:27:25,810
This is like idol posing.

3268
03:27:28,410 --> 03:27:29,410
He's so cute.

3269
03:27:31,110 --> 03:27:31,550
Okay.

3270
03:27:31,830 --> 03:27:35,010
I don't feel like I'm gonna get it because I'm gonna...

3271
03:27:36,210 --> 03:27:36,650
Yeah!

3272
03:27:47,460 --> 03:27:48,180
Oh shoot.

3273
03:27:50,220 --> 03:27:50,660
Oh,

3274
03:27:59,640 --> 03:28:00,900
we're already at this phase?

3275
03:28:02,180 --> 03:28:02,720
Oh shoot.

3276
03:28:02,860 --> 03:28:03,440
No, no, no.

3277
03:28:38,350 --> 03:28:39,290
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

3278
03:28:39,450 --> 03:28:40,750
No, I'm not even done!

3279
03:28:45,400 --> 03:28:46,260
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

3280
03:28:48,200 --> 03:28:49,320
Oh guys, guys.

3281
03:28:49,360 --> 03:28:50,080
This is not it.

3282
03:28:51,640 --> 03:28:52,080
Okay.

3283
03:28:56,520 --> 03:28:56,960
Okay.

3284
03:28:57,980 --> 03:28:59,860
Alright guys, we'll get him next time.

3285
03:28:59,940 --> 03:29:01,180
We'll get him next time.

3286
03:29:01,840 --> 03:29:04,340
You were so close, I know.

3287
03:29:08,300 --> 03:29:08,740
Dang.

3288
03:29:09,940 --> 03:29:11,460
It's okay, he's tricky.

3289
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:14,800
He was one hit away from dying, I think.

3290
03:29:15,620 --> 03:29:16,600
Should we do it?

3291
03:29:16,860 --> 03:29:19,900
You can see how much health this boss has by looking at how many horns he has.

3292
03:29:20,300 --> 03:29:22,060
It's kind of hard, he's all over the place.

3293
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:26,120
One more?

3294
03:29:26,460 --> 03:29:27,540
Okay, let's do one more.

3295
03:29:31,560 --> 03:29:34,120
One more, one more.

3296
03:29:34,720 --> 03:29:36,460
One day more.

3297
03:29:41,060 --> 03:29:46,140
I feel like if I don't do it now, I'll lose the technique for next time.

3298
03:29:47,740 --> 03:29:49,760
I feel like I'll lose the technique.

3299
03:29:52,300 --> 03:29:54,020
One day more.

3300
03:30:18,640 --> 03:30:20,920
Get him while they're kind of slowed down.

3301
03:30:25,060 --> 03:30:25,740
Nice.

3302
03:30:30,440 --> 03:30:32,440
This guy is so beefy.

3303
03:30:33,460 --> 03:30:34,460
What are you eating?

3304
03:30:41,940 --> 03:30:43,340
Why are you always this beefy?

3305
03:30:49,150 --> 03:30:50,810
He's so beefy.

3306
03:30:52,330 --> 03:30:54,690
Did you say you're old and clunky?

3307
03:30:55,550 --> 03:30:56,410
What do you mean?

3308
03:30:56,410 --> 03:30:56,550
Why are you insulting me?

3309
03:31:00,290 --> 03:31:04,210
Just because I'm insulting... I'm not insulting you, why are you insulting me?

3310
03:31:12,560 --> 03:31:14,680
What did I do to you?

3311
03:31:24,870 --> 03:31:27,730
What did I do to you to deserve this?

3312
03:31:36,450 --> 03:31:37,470
Where's the other guy?

3313
03:31:38,290 --> 03:31:39,350
I thought I saw him.

3314
03:31:39,810 --> 03:31:40,890
Oh, I think I got him.

3315
03:31:40,890 --> 03:31:42,710
Wait, is there anymore down here?

3316
03:31:43,130 --> 03:31:43,490
No?

3317
03:31:43,610 --> 03:31:43,770
OK.

3318
03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:51,200
Who even said that?

3319
03:31:51,240 --> 03:31:52,720
I need to call you out by name.

3320
03:31:53,020 --> 03:31:53,660
Where are you?

3321
03:31:56,380 --> 03:31:57,600
Where are you?

3322
03:32:01,380 --> 03:32:01,900
Mean!

3323
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:04,160
Mean mugger!

3324
03:32:04,720 --> 03:32:05,700
You are mean!

3325
03:32:05,700 --> 03:32:05,860
Mean!

3326
03:32:13,160 --> 03:32:15,140
You're real quiet now, huh?

3327
03:32:15,500 --> 03:32:16,780
You're real quiet now.

3328
03:32:20,880 --> 03:32:22,100
Oh, oopsie.

3329
03:32:24,520 --> 03:32:26,420
It's not even an apology!

3330
03:32:31,480 --> 03:32:32,640
Just oops.

3331
03:32:33,300 --> 03:32:34,500
Actually, you know what?

3332
03:32:34,520 --> 03:32:35,820
I respect that even more.

3333
03:32:35,820 --> 03:32:37,560
You're not sorry that you got caught.

3334
03:32:38,820 --> 03:32:42,460
You're just like, nah, I said it, and I meant it, and I'm not sorry.

3335
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:47,560
Man thought he wouldn't be called out.

3336
03:32:52,720 --> 03:32:54,160
Tehepero moment, real.

3337
03:32:58,300 --> 03:32:59,260
Oopsie, tehepero.

3338
03:32:59,260 --> 03:32:59,300
No!

3339
03:33:02,700 --> 03:33:04,180
I was AFK.

3340
03:33:04,240 --> 03:33:05,140
Did she pass the enemy?

3341
03:33:05,500 --> 03:33:05,740
Yes!

3342
03:33:09,500 --> 03:33:10,020
Yeah.

3343
03:33:11,080 --> 03:33:11,800
I did.

3344
03:33:14,920 --> 03:33:15,800
Wait, how many?

3345
03:33:15,980 --> 03:33:17,620
OK, still at 1500.

3346
03:33:18,060 --> 03:33:18,660
This sucks.

3347
03:33:19,220 --> 03:33:21,260
Show them who's the real boss these six months.

3348
03:33:25,920 --> 03:33:27,220
You better not have left.

3349
03:33:28,040 --> 03:33:30,340
You have to watch every single stream now.

3350
03:33:33,360 --> 03:33:34,880
We're just farming rorbs.

3351
03:33:34,960 --> 03:33:37,020
I don't think... This is like the worst way to farm them.

3352
03:33:37,720 --> 03:33:38,800
They give you barely any.

3353
03:33:40,980 --> 03:33:42,780
I want to go back to the phantom babies.

3354
03:33:44,140 --> 03:33:45,860
They gave me a ton of rorbs.

3355
03:33:46,480 --> 03:33:47,660
I would get a hundred from them.

3356
03:33:49,180 --> 03:33:51,320
Murphy, thanks for the five cup dead!

3357
03:33:52,300 --> 03:33:53,840
OK, alright, let's do this.

3358
03:33:57,600 --> 03:33:59,180
One day more.

3359
03:34:01,470 --> 03:34:01,690
OK.

3360
03:35:13,380 --> 03:35:15,500
Oh my god, we did it!

3361
03:35:15,560 --> 03:35:16,460
The Guiding Light!

3362
03:35:16,620 --> 03:35:18,100
Akiba shines in Ardour.

3363
03:35:19,240 --> 03:35:19,840
Ardour?

3364
03:35:19,840 --> 03:35:20,440
Ardour.

3365
03:35:20,680 --> 03:35:22,180
It slowly drains the power of the...

3366
03:35:24,240 --> 03:35:24,840
Wait.

3367
03:35:26,860 --> 03:35:27,460
Yippee!

3368
03:35:29,920 --> 03:35:31,020
What did I get?

3369
03:35:31,180 --> 03:35:32,600
Give me a high grade.

3370
03:35:32,600 --> 03:35:35,720
The Seabird can do it.

3371
03:35:36,220 --> 03:35:37,500
That's how it's done, boss.

3372
03:35:37,620 --> 03:35:38,980
Ducky, thanks for the five cup dead!

3373
03:35:39,120 --> 03:35:40,900
All it took was one more.

3374
03:35:42,120 --> 03:35:43,160
We did it, guys.

3375
03:35:43,220 --> 03:35:43,940
We did it.

3376
03:35:44,060 --> 03:35:45,360
Oh, I'm so proud of us.

3377
03:35:46,980 --> 03:35:47,460
Yay!

3378
03:35:48,100 --> 03:35:48,300
OK.

3379
03:35:48,560 --> 03:35:50,740
I'm gonna click next mission, but this will be for...

3380
03:35:51,320 --> 03:35:51,920
Mission 7.

3381
03:35:52,120 --> 03:35:54,380
Holding the key of Ardour.

3382
03:35:54,920 --> 03:35:55,840
Return to the bedroom.

3383
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:57,980
Oh my gosh.

3384
03:35:58,440 --> 03:35:59,820
Buy me dinner first.

3385
03:35:59,820 --> 03:36:02,520
Before the Guiding Light absorbs all of your vitality.

3386
03:36:04,600 --> 03:36:05,840
This is another timed mission, right?

3387
03:36:05,900 --> 03:36:06,340
No, no!

3388
03:36:06,460 --> 03:36:07,240
Thanks for the five gifted!

3389
03:36:07,860 --> 03:36:09,880
Maybe I should just run for it.

3390
03:36:09,940 --> 03:36:10,780
Maybe I can do it.

3391
03:36:12,120 --> 03:36:14,000
But if I power up...

3392
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:15,820
If I get another blue orb...

3393
03:36:17,740 --> 03:36:18,660
Maybe I should do this.

3394
03:36:18,760 --> 03:36:19,140
Seito!

3395
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:20,660
Thanks for the five gifted!

3396
03:36:23,500 --> 03:36:25,000
It's not as hard as it sounds.

3397
03:36:28,640 --> 03:36:29,280
Just run?

3398
03:36:29,460 --> 03:36:29,700
OK.

3399
03:36:29,840 --> 03:36:30,580
Let's do this one.

3400
03:36:30,580 --> 03:36:31,440
Sorry.

3401
03:36:31,680 --> 03:36:33,480
Because it's not a boss...

3402
03:36:33,480 --> 03:36:35,640
Because it's just a running thing...

3403
03:36:35,640 --> 03:36:37,020
Alright, I'm gonna get a blue orb.

3404
03:36:37,700 --> 03:36:37,880
OK.

3405
03:36:38,780 --> 03:36:39,140
Alright.

3406
03:36:40,180 --> 03:36:41,200
Let's go.

3407
03:36:44,480 --> 03:36:45,540
Mission... Start!

3408
03:36:47,700 --> 03:36:58,930
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' Runnin', runnin', runnin' Ignore the green blobs.

3409
03:36:59,310 --> 03:37:00,030
Ignore them.

3410
03:37:00,030 --> 03:37:00,910
Oh my gosh.

3411
03:37:02,430 --> 03:37:03,890
Are you kidding me?

3412
03:37:04,410 --> 03:37:05,770
How did you get down here?

3413
03:37:08,110 --> 03:37:09,490
How did you get down here?

3414
03:37:09,550 --> 03:37:09,910
Please.

3415
03:37:10,370 --> 03:37:10,870
Seriously.

3416
03:37:11,250 --> 03:37:11,770
Oh my god.

3417
03:37:18,560 --> 03:37:20,000
Oh, heckin' way.

3418
03:37:22,140 --> 03:37:22,660
Oh my god.

3419
03:37:24,080 --> 03:37:25,120
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3420
03:37:28,580 --> 03:37:30,100
Runnin', runnin', runnin' Oh.

3421
03:37:30,740 --> 03:37:30,920
See.

3422
03:37:31,080 --> 03:37:31,480
No, wait.

3423
03:37:31,480 --> 03:37:32,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3424
03:37:32,700 --> 03:37:34,020
No, wait.

3425
03:37:34,380 --> 03:37:36,080
This is not the door I needed to go to.

3426
03:37:40,500 --> 03:37:40,860
Cyclops?

3427
03:37:42,300 --> 03:37:43,380
Wait, I don't want to...

3428
03:37:43,380 --> 03:37:45,140
Let me out of this secret mission.

3429
03:37:48,620 --> 03:37:50,320
Into their mutual death.

3430
03:37:50,900 --> 03:37:52,040
How do I get out?

3431
03:37:52,640 --> 03:37:53,080
Oh my god.

3432
03:37:56,480 --> 03:37:57,800
Oh, is this room?

3433
03:37:58,080 --> 03:37:58,740
Oh my god.

3434
03:37:59,920 --> 03:38:01,620
Wait, I'm gonna die in here.

3435
03:38:01,940 --> 03:38:02,340
Please.

3436
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:05,180
Let me out.

3437
03:38:06,440 --> 03:38:07,520
Just run, Dante, run.

3438
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:12,800
Oh gosh.

3439
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:16,860
Where's the... Oh, over here.

3440
03:38:18,220 --> 03:38:18,600
Oh my god.

3441
03:38:20,300 --> 03:38:21,440
Down here, down here, down here.

3442
03:38:21,740 --> 03:38:22,560
Oh, wait.

3443
03:38:22,660 --> 03:38:23,280
I have to...

3444
03:38:23,280 --> 03:38:25,340
I have to kill them.

3445
03:38:25,900 --> 03:38:26,260
I think.

3446
03:38:26,700 --> 03:38:27,100
Oh god.

3447
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:29,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3448
03:38:30,340 --> 03:38:31,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3449
03:38:31,600 --> 03:38:32,260
These guys suck.

3450
03:38:32,640 --> 03:38:33,020
Wait.

3451
03:38:36,260 --> 03:38:36,660
Please.

3452
03:38:38,120 --> 03:38:39,220
I'm gonna die here.

3453
03:38:39,700 --> 03:38:41,140
Oh, yes, thank you.

3454
03:38:41,300 --> 03:38:41,840
Thank you, Digger.

3455
03:38:41,940 --> 03:38:43,080
Devil trigger, devil trigger.

3456
03:38:43,420 --> 03:38:43,980
Thank you.

3457
03:38:53,620 --> 03:38:54,920
Devil trigger, devil trigger.

3458
03:38:56,520 --> 03:38:59,180
No, I do have to fight because the door was blocked.

3459
03:39:00,140 --> 03:39:01,860
Oh my god, I'm not gonna make it though.

3460
03:39:02,720 --> 03:39:04,460
I'm actually... I don't know if I'm gonna make it for real.

3461
03:39:34,320 --> 03:39:36,140
Oh, I've lost... I've missed one.

3462
03:39:36,200 --> 03:39:36,660
It's ok.

3463
03:39:39,720 --> 03:39:40,760
Bothersome flies.

3464
03:39:46,400 --> 03:39:47,380
Ok, run.

3465
03:39:48,640 --> 03:39:49,940
Run, Dante, run!

3466
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:51,060
Ok, we made it.

3467
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:53,720
Here.

3468
03:39:57,850 --> 03:39:58,850
Use the guiding light.

3469
03:39:58,910 --> 03:39:59,190
Yes!

3470
03:40:08,660 --> 03:40:10,690
I like this music.

3471
03:40:10,790 --> 03:40:12,750
I like how you can just hear random music.

3472
03:40:14,110 --> 03:40:14,830
Yippee!

3473
03:40:15,770 --> 03:40:17,350
I got an A.

3474
03:40:19,310 --> 03:40:20,330
B.

3475
03:40:22,590 --> 03:40:23,610
Yay!

3476
03:40:24,490 --> 03:40:25,130
Yippee!

3477
03:40:26,470 --> 03:40:31,010
I think actually buying that other blueberry helped.

3478
03:40:31,750 --> 03:40:32,650
I'm Dante.

3479
03:40:33,830 --> 03:40:36,910
I think buying that other blueberry helped.

3480
03:40:40,390 --> 03:40:40,790
Alright.

3481
03:40:42,010 --> 03:40:43,870
Wait, did I do it?

3482
03:40:43,930 --> 03:40:44,150
Yes.

3483
03:40:44,270 --> 03:40:44,830
Ok, there we go.

3484
03:40:44,890 --> 03:40:45,450
Ok, just kidding.

3485
03:40:45,910 --> 03:40:46,650
Alright, next mission.

3486
03:40:46,710 --> 03:40:48,270
Let's see what the next mission is before I...

3487
03:40:50,650 --> 03:40:51,610
Wait, what is this?

3488
03:40:54,270 --> 03:40:57,430
I thought Dante had long hair for a second.

3489
03:41:05,980 --> 03:41:07,940
The legendary knight returns!

3490
03:41:08,080 --> 03:41:10,320
Activate the mechanism and escape from the rooftop.

3491
03:41:14,400 --> 03:41:15,720
Let's do that.

3492
03:41:17,020 --> 03:41:20,360
I feel like if I don't stop here, I'm never going to stop.

3493
03:41:21,680 --> 03:41:23,780
If I don't stop here, I'm never going to stop.

3494
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:25,820
So next time...

3495
03:41:25,820 --> 03:41:31,100
Next week we will do mission 8 and we'll see how far we get from there.

3496
03:41:33,500 --> 03:41:36,980
There's no good stopping point.

3497
03:41:36,980 --> 03:41:42,520
Yeah, otherwise I'll just keep going and going and going.

3498
03:41:45,020 --> 03:41:46,320
Maybe next week.

3499
03:41:47,400 --> 03:41:48,120
I don't know.

3500
03:41:48,200 --> 03:41:50,220
Maybe I can do an endurance.

3501
03:41:50,340 --> 03:41:50,780
I'm not sure.

3502
03:41:51,400 --> 03:41:51,880
But we'll see.

3503
03:41:52,620 --> 03:41:56,320
Not to finish, but just to go longer.

3504
03:41:59,900 --> 03:42:02,220
7 missions is about a third of the way through.

3505
03:42:02,220 --> 03:42:02,640
Yeah!

3506
03:42:04,940 --> 03:42:06,200
Chai Princess, thank you!

3507
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:07,280
Oh my gosh.

3508
03:42:07,360 --> 03:42:09,680
Wait, I couldn't hear you guys' donos.

3509
03:42:11,240 --> 03:42:12,500
This game wrecked me when I was younger.

3510
03:42:12,560 --> 03:42:13,580
Also, good luck at VMuse.

3511
03:42:13,700 --> 03:42:15,140
I bought a streaming ticket.

3512
03:42:15,640 --> 03:42:16,280
Thank you!

3513
03:42:16,980 --> 03:42:18,420
Thank you, YouGamedVtuber.

3514
03:42:18,640 --> 03:42:19,320
Thank you!

3515
03:42:20,500 --> 03:42:21,820
Hope you keep playing this game, Rinto.

3516
03:42:21,900 --> 03:42:22,820
I will, of course.

3517
03:42:23,280 --> 03:42:24,360
I'm having a lot of fun.

3518
03:42:26,940 --> 03:42:27,860
Thank you!

3519
03:42:28,080 --> 03:42:31,340
None of us are bored at our Optimus Prime, Rinto.

3520
03:42:35,980 --> 03:42:37,780
Thank you guys for the help, too.

3521
03:42:38,640 --> 03:42:40,380
I guess I'm fine to quit, right?

3522
03:42:40,520 --> 03:42:43,880
Because I'll just load from where I saved.

3523
03:42:46,180 --> 03:42:48,820
Don't forget Game Mechanics, VTuber.

3524
03:42:48,900 --> 03:42:49,940
I can't even speak today.

3525
03:42:50,060 --> 03:42:52,260
I will try not to forget Game Mechanics.

3526
03:42:52,260 --> 03:42:54,820
I will try not to forget.

3527
03:42:56,540 --> 03:42:58,740
But yeah, this was fun.

3528
03:42:58,880 --> 03:42:59,920
Thank you guys.

3529
03:43:00,340 --> 03:43:01,460
Devil may sleep now.

3530
03:43:03,720 --> 03:43:04,200
Yeah.

3531
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:06,600
Devil didn't cry.

3532
03:43:06,740 --> 03:43:07,540
Devil may sleep.

3533
03:43:08,480 --> 03:43:10,980
1 third of the game in one sitting is great for first DMC.

3534
03:43:11,060 --> 03:43:12,260
You're doing fantastic, VTuber.

3535
03:43:12,820 --> 03:43:14,680
Aww, you guys beat it?

3536
03:43:14,820 --> 03:43:15,520
Oh my gosh.

3537
03:43:15,520 --> 03:43:17,700
You guys are being so nice to me today.

3538
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:18,620
Thank you!

3539
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:21,320
I really appreciate it.

3540
03:43:21,340 --> 03:43:22,420
Devil may snooze.

3541
03:43:24,960 --> 03:43:27,000
I hope you guys have a good snooze.

3542
03:43:27,020 --> 03:43:27,840
Have a good rest.

3543
03:43:28,020 --> 03:43:28,980
And it's the weekend!

3544
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:30,620
Have a good weekend!

3545
03:43:32,980 --> 03:43:36,020
We'll finish up Snake Eater probably on Sunday.

3546
03:43:36,660 --> 03:43:37,140
Probably.

3547
03:43:38,140 --> 03:43:44,740
I'm gonna make a waiting room for Sunday and see how I feel after sleeping some after VMuse.

3548
03:43:44,740 --> 03:43:46,380
So, go soon!

3549
03:43:46,520 --> 03:43:47,360
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

3550
03:43:49,440 --> 03:43:50,840
I'm excited that you're enjoying the game.

3551
03:43:50,920 --> 03:43:52,820
I'm excited to watch my Kamiyoshi play the series.

3552
03:43:53,080 --> 03:43:57,880
Thanks for playing the Resident Evil offshoot game.

3553
03:43:58,880 --> 03:43:59,480
Of course.

3554
03:44:08,870 --> 03:44:09,670
Bye bye!

3555
03:44:10,170 --> 03:44:10,930
Have a good night!

3556
03:44:10,990 --> 03:44:11,470
Have a good night!

3557
03:44:11,510 --> 03:44:12,150
Have a good night!

3558
03:44:12,150 --> 03:44:17,750
And I will see you guys whenever I stream next, which I'm not quite sure when.

3559
03:44:18,670 --> 03:44:19,050
Uday!

3560
03:44:19,470 --> 03:44:20,190
Welcome to membership!

3561
03:44:20,330 --> 03:44:21,270
Oh my gosh, are you me?

3562
03:44:21,730 --> 03:44:22,510
Brick, welcome back!

3563
03:44:22,610 --> 03:44:23,070
Thank you!

3564
03:44:23,470 --> 03:44:23,850
Stop it.

3565
03:44:23,930 --> 03:44:24,530
We're having a good time.

3566
03:44:24,590 --> 03:44:25,050
Thanks, couple!

3567
03:44:26,390 --> 03:44:27,370
Bye bye, guys!

3568
03:44:27,410 --> 03:44:28,150
Bye bye!

3569
03:44:28,330 --> 03:44:28,670
Good night!

3570
03:44:28,790 --> 03:44:29,050
Good night!

3571
03:44:29,130 --> 03:44:29,590
Thank you!

3572
03:44:29,970 --> 03:44:30,510
See you!

3573
03:44:30,670 --> 03:44:31,250
Bye bye!
