1
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,650
Why is it so quiet?

2
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,820
Why are you guys so crazy?

3
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,060
Why are you so crazy?

4
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,020
Why are you all so crazy?

5
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,920
Actually crazy.

6
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm looking at you.

7
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,620
The guy above me is crazy.

8
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,720
Absolutely bonkers.

9
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,790
Thank you guys.

10
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,830
For all the...

11
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:25,950
the members and the donated members and the donors the Super Chats Thank you.

12
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,110
Thanks.

13
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,390
Oh my goodness gracious.

14
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,490
But yeah.

15
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,190
Thank you.

16
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,090
Thank you very much.

17
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,570
Oh my gosh.

18
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,550
Thank you for that.

19
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,130
Go Super!

20
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,390
Thank you.

21
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,230
This Super Chat is mint colored, right?

22
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm color blind.

23
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,270
No!

24
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,310
Oh yes.

25
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,470
I really appreciate it.

26
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,330
I opened memberships yesterday.

27
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,090
I didn't even tell anyone.

28
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,950
And people found out somehow.

29
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,030
Which is so crazy.

30
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,190
But welcome to membership.

31
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,130
If you joined, thank you.

32
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,850
Or if you gifted.

33
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,690
If you gifted, thank you.

34
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,250
And if you were gifted, thank you for being here.

35
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:10,690
Anyway.

36
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,790
Of course there's no...

37
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,250
No pressure to donate.

38
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,010
As usual.

39
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,870
And no pressure to join.

40
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,690
Or anything like that.

41
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,350
And for anyone who says that it's too cheap.

42
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,390
Screw you!

43
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,490
For anyone who says raise the price.

44
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,150
No!

45
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,770
What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,110
You say what's wrong with me.

47
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,210
And I say what's wrong with you?

48
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,130
I ask.

49
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,510
What is wrong with you?

50
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,990
I mentioned it kind of before briefly.

51
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,770
I said that for memberships.

52
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,110
I planned on...

53
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,410
Making them a lower tier.

54
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,890
A lower price.

55
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,010
Because...

56
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,550
Because...

57
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,150
Since I have the podcast.

58
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,990
To be honest.

59
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,870
I won't be able to focus so much on like...

60
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,810
Membership content.

61
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,190
It kind of was like...

62
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,770
You'll get some membership streams.

63
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,450
Oh my gosh.

64
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,730
Thank you guys.

65
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,330
There will be some membership streams of course.

66
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,530
But...

67
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,450
It's like mostly for the emotes.

68
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,390
And...

69
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,490
And then once I get the Minecraft server set up.

70
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,230
That.

71
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,250
Yeah.

72
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,650
No pressure of course.

73
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,130
You guys are making me...

74
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,930
Feel like I need to do more.

75
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,830
Because you guys are...

76
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,470
Joining so fast.

77
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,250
And...

78
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,550
Gifting so many.

79
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,150
But yeah.

80
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,210
Oh my gosh.

81
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,390
Thank you for the pinks.

82
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,930
Thank you.

83
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,990
Also I want to say...

84
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,030
A little bit today.

85
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,590
I don't know.

86
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,090
I have not been feeling so great lately.

87
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,810
Like just until...

88
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,110
Up until this stream.

89
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,770
My stomach was killing me again.

90
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,010
I think I am...

91
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,310
I am possessing some people that...

92
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,590
Are not...

93
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,010
Eating healthily.

94
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,750
So please think of your local ghost maid.

95
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,190
And eat well.

96
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,290
So that if I possess you...

97
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,790
You...

98
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,270
Don't hurt me in return.

99
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:30,790
You know?

100
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,070
I think part of it is stress though.

101
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,670
Just because I kind of came back from Japan.

102
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,670
And didn't...

103
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,950
Didn't have any time to rest.

104
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,110
When I came back home.

105
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,150
And...

106
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,690
And also...

107
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,990
I don't know...

108
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,730
Have you guys ever heard...

109
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,430
This is for all you cat owners out there.

110
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,670
If you weren't aware.

111
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,390
If you ever smell your cat.

112
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,490
And they smell a little bit sweet.

113
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,830
Then you are...

114
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,210
Kind of like a maple syrup.

115
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,830
It's like...

116
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,910
It could be like an actual medical condition.

117
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,510
And I smelled my cat's head.

118
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,750
And I was just like...

119
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,830
Why do you smell so sweet?

120
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,850
What did you get into?

121
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,930
And then I was like...

122
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,770
Uh oh.

123
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,950
And I remembered.

124
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,550
So tomorrow I have to call the vet.

125
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,990
And schedule a...

126
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,250
It could be diabetes.

127
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,690
Like feline diabetes.

128
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,290
Or it could be...

129
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,790
Like you know...

130
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,210
I looked it up.

131
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,550
Because I wasn't aware of the other things.

132
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,630
But it could be also...

133
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,570
A kidney thing.

134
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,190
Or a skin thing.

135
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,790
And he has been having some issues with his ears.

136
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,590
So I'm hoping it's the skin thing.

137
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,270
Because that would be the easiest thing.

138
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,870
To take care of.

139
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,270
But he's going to be okay.

140
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,230
Because I'm going to take him to the vet.

141
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,230
And we're going to get him all checked out.

142
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,850
But it does stress me out a little bit.

143
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,070
If he's good or not.

144
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,710
You know what I mean?

145
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,330
He's pregnant.

146
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,790
Oh my gosh.

147
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,750
I've always wanted...

148
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,810
Grand kittens.

149
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,630
Hoping for the best.

150
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,090
Thank you.

151
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,910
I don't mean to start the stream with such a...

152
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,590
Heavy topic.

153
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,490
Just letting you guys...

154
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,970
Letting you guys know...

155
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,150
Why I'm feeling a little...

156
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,070
In the brain.

157
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,830
You know?

158
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,450
My teeth.

159
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,150
Okay.

160
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,970
I'm going to...

161
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:27,910
No!

162
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,310
Okay.

163
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:29,570
Hold on.

164
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,250
No!

165
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:31,990
Okay.

166
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,590
I tested the game yesterday.

167
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,750
And it did this to me.

168
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,830
It is so bizarre.

169
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,470
When I'm clicking on this...

170
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,390
It's showing up...

171
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,490
In OBS.

172
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:44,970
Right?

173
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,150
It's showing up in OBS.

174
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,530
Right?

175
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,810
But on my actual screen...

176
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,690
It's not.

177
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,310
So I have to look at it...

178
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,870
Through OBS.

179
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,190
It's very strange.

180
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,690
How do I get out of this?

181
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,690
I'm actually going to pop out the screen.

182
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,210
Let me try that.

183
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,650
And...

184
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,930
Have it open three times.

185
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,650
Okay.

186
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:08,950
Wait.

187
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,590
That doesn't work.

188
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,430
Because I still have to...

189
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,470
Have it on this.

190
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,150
This is so weird.

191
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,590
I think it's because...

192
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,610
It's so old.

193
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,670
Subtitles on maybe?

194
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,110
Oh yes.

195
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,510
They will be on.

196
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,550
So weird.

197
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,390
Very weird.

198
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:29,950
Anyway.

199
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,490
The game must be haunted.

200
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:31,830
I know.

201
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,430
The cursor is so cursed.

202
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,390
I'm going to actually...

203
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,610
Sorry.

204
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,710
I'm going to make the notice...

205
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,590
A tiny bit smaller.

206
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,430
I think there's going to be a lot of them.

207
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,330
But thank you.

208
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,790
Okay.

209
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,010
Okay.

210
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,550
For people that don't know this game.

211
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,930
It's old game.

212
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,790
I also don't know so much about it.

213
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,030
I've always seen...

214
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,650
Thank you for the 50.

215
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,150
Thank you.

216
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,050
Thank you so much.

217
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,410
I've always seen...

218
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,110
Like...

219
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,910
Screenshots from it.

220
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,850
But I'll be honest.

221
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,970
I've never...

222
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,050
I've never played it.

223
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,450
I've never tried this game before.

224
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,050
So it's kind of...

225
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,710
Reminds me of like The Negotiator.

226
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,710
It's old though.

227
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,270
It's old.

228
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,730
And I've also never watched anyone play it.

229
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,670
I just know that it's a little cursed.

230
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,150
And it's like...

231
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,990
It's like one of those games where you input your actions.

232
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,230
Or input what you say.

233
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,690
Before like AI was ever...

234
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,470
Like it has it's own in game AI.

235
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,930
You know?

236
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,050
Yeah.

237
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,550
OG AI chat bot.

238
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,070
This is a classic.

239
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,810
It is a classic.

240
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:44,710
Classic.

241
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,010
Classic.

242
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,990
It's pretty cursed.

243
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,950
So...

244
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,970
We're gonna do our best to...

245
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,150
I don't know.

246
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,650
I don't know.

247
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,910
Got some mischief or something.

248
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,970
I don't know.

249
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,890
I don't know.

250
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,930
I don't know.

251
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,690
Probably fuck.

252
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,810
Sorry.

253
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,910
Have you guys seen that video of...

254
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,850
Miranda Cosgrove?

255
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,730
What's your favorite cuss word?

256
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,390
She goes...

257
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,870
Probably fuck.

258
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,390
Sorry.

259
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,770
Bleep that bleep that bleep that bleep that.

260
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,870
Probably bleep.

261
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,690
Sorry.

262
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,150
Sorry.

263
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,070
Sorry.

264
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,330
Sorry.

265
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,390
For saying such a bad word.

266
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:31,870
I'm so sorry.

267
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,750
Oh my.

268
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,470
Clutches pearls.

269
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,750
Anyway.

270
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,710
I'm so sorry.

271
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,110
Anyway.

272
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,370
It was the way that I...

273
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,270
It was the way that I said...

274
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,270
Cuss of mischief that made me think of it.

275
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,510
Okay?

276
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,410
Anyway.

277
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,550
You guys... You guys get me, right?

278
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,630
You guys understand me.

279
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:52,790
Right?

280
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,150
So do we name ourselves...

281
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,170
Melon?

282
00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,570
Oh!

283
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,110
Wait.

284
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,350
I have to choose a name.

285
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,410
Oh they don't have mint.

286
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:04,970
Tammy?

287
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:05,710
Wait.

288
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,910
What would the closest to mint be?

289
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:07,890
Mark.

290
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,190
Mary.

291
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,290
Mary.

292
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,590

293
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,330

294
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:11,770
Mel.

295
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,830

296
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,610
Thank you for that.

297
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,450
Thank you.

298
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,030
Oh my.

300
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,010
Nat.

301
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,510
Nick.

302
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:18,930
Nicole.

303
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,610
Oh my gosh.

304
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,730
There's so many names.

305
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,990
But they don't have mint.

306
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,330
Hmm.

307
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,010
Oh hi Mark.

308
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,110
David.

309
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,330
Let's see.

310
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,170
Let's go to the very top.

311
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,150
Meow.

312
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,550
Meow.

313
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:35,850
Meow.

314
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,730
Adam.

315
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,070
Al.

316
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,550
Hmm.

317
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,370
Andrew.

318
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,470
Oh my gosh.

319
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,170
I might say your name.

320
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,610
Isn't that kind of crazy?

321
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,390
Gon...

322
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,310
Gonzalo.

323
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,310
Gonzolo?

324
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,470
Ashley.

325
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,170
Oh.

326
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,030
Audrey.

327
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:58,770
Ben.

328
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,610
Am I... Am I... Did I say your name?

329
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,110
Raise your hand if I said your name.

330
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:03,690
Gonzalo.

331
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,930
Is that an actual one in here?

332
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:07,990
Gonzalo.

333
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,310
Is that a real name?

334
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,270
Genevra.

335
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,150
I've never heard of that name before either.

336
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,370
Um.

337
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:18,970
Espen.

338
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,490
Any Espens in the chat?

339
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,250
Aaron.

340
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:23,930
Eric.

341
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,870
Emily.

342
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,650
Ellen.

343
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,070
Elizabeth.

344
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,670
Ed.

345
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,130
Doug.

346
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,010
Diana.

347
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,830
Roll call.

348
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,270
Wisp roll call.

349
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm Gonzalo.

350
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,110
Okay.

351
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,990
Since you're Gonzalo, we'll go with Gonzalo.

352
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,250
Wait.

353
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:43,790
What did they say?

354
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,330
Plissken?

355
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,730
That's so funny.

356
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,550
I thought, um.

357
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,910
When I tested this out.

358
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,230
I just picked Adam.

359
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,110
But I thought, uh.

360
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,150
Oh.

361
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,330
It does say, please choose a name.

362
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,090
Type the first letter.

363
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,170
Scroll with the arrow keys.

364
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,050
Press enter to begin.

365
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,550
It does say that entirely.

366
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,630
And I just, uh.

367
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,370
I thought maybe, um.

368
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,010
I could type in my name.

369
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,210
And I was like, will they say it?

370
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,950
Like, is there like an in-game voice thing?

371
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,890
Kind of like, you know.

372
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,150
Like some, uh.

373
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:15,890
What's the word?

374
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,890
Some gacha games.

375
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,230
You type in your name.

376
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,070
And it'll be like.

377
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,370
Mint.

378
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,150
Hello.

379
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,290
How are you?

380
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,290
Mint.

381
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,090
You know.

382
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,370
Gonzalo.

383
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,170
Oh my god.

384
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,730
Blue archive.

385
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,010
Yes.

386
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,630
Okay.

387
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,190
So let's, uh.

388
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,190
Let's look at the instructions.

389
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,630
Real quick.

390
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,550
Um.

391
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,650
Type to speak to the character at any time.

392
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,010
Move around with the arrow.

393
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,990
Look at this keyboard.

394
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,490
Sorry.

395
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,710
If I move off the screen.

396
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,090
It's because I have the other window open.

397
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:50,450
Like.

398
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,530
Type to speak to the characters at any time.

399
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,030
Move around with arrow keys.

400
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,170
Pick up and use objects with the mouse.

401
00:14:59,050 --> 00:14:59,450
Actually.

402
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,890
I wonder if there's another way that I can.

403
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,210
Capture this.

404
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,070
I wonder if I do.

405
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,990
Window capture instead.

406
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,470
If it will allow me to see it.

407
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,170
Do you guys mind?

408
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:12,610
Sorry.

409
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,630
I totally should've.

410
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,990
I didn't think it would be an issue.

411
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,530
I should've totally done it.

412
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,250
Off stream.

413
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,930
I was like.

414
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,150
Oh maybe it's because I messed with something.

415
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,070
I was doing a couple setting things.

416
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,810
Go ahead.

417
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,570
Go ahead.

418
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,070
Okay.

419
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,570
Thank you guys.

420
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,090
It's not gonna take long.

421
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,070
Let's see.

422
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,330
Window capture.

423
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,550
La la la la la.

424
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,970
La la la.

425
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,550
Oh wait.

426
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,010
This is.

427
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,370
Wait.

428
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,630
This is even.

429
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,570
Hold on.

430
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,830
This is.

431
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,270
See.

432
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,690
This is what I'm seeing.

433
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,510
When I click instructions.

434
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,190
Nothing.

435
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,690
This is.

436
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,410
Oh my gosh.

437
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,030
So it doesn't.

438
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,390
Okay.

439
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,550
Wait.

440
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:56,810
Hold on.

441
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm gonna restart the game.

442
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,430
Oh.

443
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,010
Oh.

444
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,450
Okay.

445
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,830
Let's restart.

446
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,770
Restart.

447
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,050
Restart.

448
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:05,750
Okay.

449
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,210
Um.

450
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,350
Okay.

451
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,710
It's okay because there's a little scene at the beginning too.

452
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,210
We can watch.

453
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,140
And the cursor's fixed.

454
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,980
Look at that.

455
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,400
I think it was good.

456
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,340
I'm gonna move it down.

457
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,760
There.

458
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,820
May take up to 60 seconds.

459
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,820
We are so back baby.

460
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,360
Yippee.

461
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,140
Oh.

462
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,600
They did say 60 seconds.

463
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,420
Hmm.

464
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:42,880
Hmm.

465
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,580
Hmm.

466
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,180
Hmm.

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,740
Hmm.

468
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,580
Hmm.

469
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,160
Hmm.

470
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,640
Hmm.

471
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,180
Hmm.

472
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,440
Hello.

473
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,040
Hey.

474
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,180
It's Tripp.

475
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,100
Oh my god.

476
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,580
Tripp.

477
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,160
Uh.

478
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,860
Geez.

479
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,080
It's been a long time since we got together.

480
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,420
Trying to blow out my eardrums.

481
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,620
But uh.

482
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,220
Uh.

483
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,480
Grace and I just thought it'd be.

484
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,440
It'd be.

485
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,200
It'd be really nice to see you tonight.

486
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,080
Tonight?

487
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:15,980
Oh.

488
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,300
Okay.

489
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,500
Yeah.

490
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:18,980
Uh.

491
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,920
How about 8 o'clock or something?

492
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,200
That'd be uh.

493
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,620
That'd be really nice.

494
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,200
Or 7.

495
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,200
Um.

496
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,040
Hope we can make it.

497
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,620
Oh yeah.

498
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:27,880
I will.

499
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,720
I'll be there.

500
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,760
It is so suspicious sounding.

501
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,040
It is so.

502
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,140
Suspicious sounding.

503
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,480
Whoa.

504
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,040
Facade.

505
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,420
Look our little happy.

506
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,020
Happy couple.

507
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,980
Question mark.

508
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,240
Hmm.

509
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,900
He's so awkward.

510
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,440
Maybe he's just shy.

511
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,980
I also struggle with talking on the phone.

512
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,880
Thank you guys for all the super chats.

513
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,720
Thank you.

514
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,720
Thank you.

515
00:17:59,760 --> 00:17:59,980
Thank you.

516
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,300
And.

517
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,260
Let's see.

518
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,100
It works.

519
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,700
Okay.

520
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,240
There is no problem that I can't solve.

521
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,780
I'm a genius.

522
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,680
Okay.

523
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,420
Let's see the hints.

524
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,260
Oh wow.

525
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,040
This is a lot.

526
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,300
Okay.

527
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,360
Grace and Trip are in a desperate situation.

528
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,120
They need you.

529
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
You could influence them in several ways.

530
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,880
Exactly how.

531
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,180
Is up to you.

532
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,260
One approach is to try to help them.

533
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,080
To get them to work through their problems.

534
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,300
Or.

535
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,580
You could try to provoke and upset them.

536
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,940
Even be cruel.

537
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,100
If you want.

538
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,120
You can try to dig under the surface to expose the secrets they're hiding.

539
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,960
Sometimes it's necessary to talk fast and interrupt Grace and Trip.

540
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,240
To get a word in.

541
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,220
They tend to respond to agreement and disagreement.

542
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:47,840
Praise.

543
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,300
Criticism.

544
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,820
Flirtation.

545
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,760
References to relationship topics.

546
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,520
Such as divorce and...

547
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,540
Questions about their life.

548
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,780
Explanations and advice and so on.

549
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,240
As the tension builds.

550
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,640
They may try to force you to take sides.

551
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,820
Eventually they may seek your advice.

552
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,500
To get you to tell them what's wrong with them.

553
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Depending on what you say or do.

554
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,300
Will determine if they stay together or not.

555
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,000
Facade needs to be replayed several times.

556
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,320
To experience the variation in the drama.

557
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
For more detailed hints...

558
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:28,940
Oh.

559
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,020
The mouse is...

560
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,020
Oh.

561
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,700
Wait.

562
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,080
It looks good for you guys.

563
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,360
It is cursed for me.

564
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,960
You know what.

565
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,320
As long as it looks good for you guys.

566
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,040
Okay.

567
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,600
Let's turn the subtitles on.

568
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,380
Let's get going baby.

569
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,620
Let's go.

570
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,420
Oh my gosh.

571
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,960
I'm nervous.

572
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,220
What was it?

573
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,960
Was it Wasta to walk around?

574
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm so small.

575
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,960
They're trapping me in.

576
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh never mind.

577
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:00,860
Wait.

578
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,860
Why am I moving back and forth?

579
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,940
Give me a second.

580
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,160
Hello?

581
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,720
Fine.

582
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,900
Gonzalo!

583
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,700
Hey.

584
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,660
I thought I heard someone out here.

585
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,600
Great to see you.

586
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,300
It's been a while.

587
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,820
How's it going?

588
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:18,940
Wait.

589
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,360
Hold on.

590
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,100
How do I move?

591
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,520
Oh.

592
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:22,940
Here we go.

593
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,240
Well.

594
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,900
Come on in.

595
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,780
Hello.

596
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,200
Don't move.

597
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,780
Let me go get Grace.

598
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,240
Okay.

599
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,540
I'm gonna come in.

600
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,760
No.

601
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:33,900
No.

602
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,740
Here we are.

603
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,280
Gonzalo.

604
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,080
Hi.

605
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,340
How are you?

606
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,960
Oh god.

607
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,360
It's been such a long time.

608
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,340
Hi.

609
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,680
Yeah.

610
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,480
How are you doing?

611
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,980
I just asked him that.

612
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,860
I'm great.

613
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,360
Oh.

614
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,280
By the way.

615
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,080
You look fabulous.

616
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh.

617
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:52,940
You too, babe.

618
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,760
So come on in.

619
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,840
Make yourself at home.

620
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,780
Gonzalo.

621
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
That's such a...

622
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,560
That's an interesting way to say hello.

623
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,180
You're such a kidder.

624
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,100
Gonzalo.

625
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,460
Let me get you a drink.

626
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,620
Oh.

627
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,260
I'll get it.

628
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,400
No.

629
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,280
We have a guest.

630
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,380
We can let the answering machine pick it up.

631
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,500
Macchiato, please.

632
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,020
What?

633
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,660
Wait.

634
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,020
Wait.

635
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,060
Let's just wait for the answering machine.

636
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll pick up.

637
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,320
Oh.

638
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,800
Hmm.

639
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,020
Gonzalo.

640
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,460
Oh.

641
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,640
No.

642
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,860
Who is this?

643
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,160
Grace?

644
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,940
Is that you?

645
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,300
Oh.

646
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,920
That's my dad.

647
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,960
I can hear his voice.

648
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,620
Oh.

649
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,540
Dad?

650
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,280
Okay.

651
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,840
He's being annoying as usual.

652
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,200
Dad?

653
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,600
Are you alive?

654
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,640
I've... I've missed you.

655
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,740
Dad!

656
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,900
Grace's parents.

657
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,160
They're something else.

658
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,340
Really classy people.

659
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,780
No.

660
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,360
They're impossible.

661
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,200
They're always expecting me to act like the dutiful daughter.

662
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,240
It's so annoying.

663
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,680
This is so beautiful.

664
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:57,780
Oh.

665
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,240
I can't look up.

666
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,480
Well.

667
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,640
It didn't take long for you two to bond or whatever.

668
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,500
Aren't we friends?

669
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:02,920
Hey.

670
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,180
Gonzalo.

671
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,940
Seeing you brings back good memories.

672
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,340
You know?

673
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,080
Why is everyone talking over each other?

674
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,920
It's so chaos.

675
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,240
Whoa.

676
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,660
I just realized something.

677
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,320
What?

678
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,160
Uh.

679
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:16,920
Well.

680
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,220
Tonight is special.

681
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,100
Gonzalo.

682
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,720
Remember?

683
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,200
It was almost exactly ten years ago tonight that you introduced us.

684
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,740
Senior year of college.

685
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,340
Oh.

686
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,740
Geez.

687
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,000
Remember that?

688
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,220
I remember.

689
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,280
We really want to thank you for years and years of...

690
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,140
Pain.

691
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,920
Agony.

692
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,120
Haunting.

693
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,480
Love.

694
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,600
Why do they look at each other like that?

695
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:44,620
I mean.

696
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,140
It's...

697
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,900
It's a great day to be here tonight.

698
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,780
What are you... What is that?

699
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,560
Oh.

700
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:50,880
That.

701
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,440
That's just a little joke advice giver toy thing that I like to consult every now and then.

702
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,480
What?

703
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,640
When I need a little guidance.

704
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,960
His mother gave that to him.

705
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,600
Aww.

706
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,700
Aww.

707
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm gonna fix us some drinks.

708
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,280
Well.

709
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,200
We should drink.

710
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,640
We should have something fun.

711
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,160
Like sangria.

712
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,340
Sangria?

713
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,720
Everybody tells me I fix the best drinks.

714
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,960
So I'm sure you're gonna love this.

715
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,220
Now Tripp.

716
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,140
Don't get too worked up with the drinks tonight.

717
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,960
I'm gonna puke.

718
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,720
No.

719
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,620
Tripp.

720
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,780
Don't pressure our friend.

721
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,180
Okay?

722
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,060
No.

723
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,040
Maybe you'd like some juice or mineral water.

724
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,580
Oh.

725
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,020
Come on.

726
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,540
No.

727
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:34,940
Oh.

728
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,300
I'll take a hot one.

729
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,000
Good.

730
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,500
Okay.

731
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,040
Alright.

732
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,820
Fine.

733
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,440
Fine.

734
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,380
This reminds me of the time we had your book group friends over.

735
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,180
Grace.

736
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,020
I know what you want.

737
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,500
But I'll ask anyway.

738
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,760
What would you like to drink?

739
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,700
I'm going to join our friend in what he is having.

740
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,020
Ooh.

741
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,140
Girl feeling spicy.

742
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,800
Well.

743
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,520
I uh.

744
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,000
I know what you want Grace.

745
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,800
So.

746
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,360
Gonzalo.

747
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,580
I'm hoping you can help me understand where I went wrong with my new decorating.

748
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,200
Your decorating is beautiful.

749
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,560
Alright Grace.

750
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,380
Yours is ready.

751
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,080
Thanks.

752
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,780
See.

753
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,840
I told you he would like it.

754
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,240
Yeah.

755
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,260
There's nothing wrong with it.

756
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,440
Yeah.

757
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:16,940
That's what I said.

758
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,760
So.

759
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,680
About my decorating.

760
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,080
That's what I.

761
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,460
You know when I look at this wedding picture hanging here in this room.

762
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:24,780
Do you have anime figures?

763
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,420
Yeah.

764
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,160
Oh god.

765
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,900
It's impressive.

766
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,100
Even after a full day's work designing magazine ads.

767
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,100
Grace somehow finds the time to decorate.

768
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,760
Haha.

769
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,420
I guess it's just the artist in me dying to get out.

770
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,460
This is yours.

771
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh.

772
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:38,760
That's good.

773
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,080
So about this wedding picture here.

774
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,280
It obviously just does not go anymore.

775
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:44,980
What?

776
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,520
What do you mean?

777
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,960
I mean with my new decorating and all.

778
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,200
Oh Grace.

779
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,660
Whoa.

780
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,420
It's like distorting.

781
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,780
Whoa.

782
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,800
Whoa.

783
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,000
I think it's melting.

784
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,340
Ah yes.

785
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,660
I've been waiting for someone.

786
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,840
Oh but I liked what you said about my decorating.

787
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,320
Besides I'm redoing it all this week.

788
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,000
What do you mean?

789
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,700
You've been waiting for someone to say that.

790
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,080
Well.

791
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,220
You and I are getting along better tonight than I first thought.

792
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,240
Aren't we friends?

793
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,500
Like I'm confused.

794
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,120
Oh god.

795
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,720
Oh.

796
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,620
Thanks.

797
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,780
Oh that's nice Grace.

798
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Our friend seems happy to see you again after so long.

799
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,200
What?

800
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,560
Uh oh.

801
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,680
The music's getting kind of crazy.

802
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,100
Tripp have you noticed we're fighting in front of our friend?

803
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,840
Grace.

804
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,540
Come on.

805
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,540
That kind of statement is not helpful.

806
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,900
Tripp there's nothing wrong with disagreeing.

807
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,720
In front of our friend.

808
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,680
We're not disagreeing.

809
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,480
Shut up.

810
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,140
Shut up.

811
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,700
That's...

812
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,700
Whoa.

813
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,880
Are you sick?

814
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,440
Are you sick?

815
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,440
Why are you coughing?

816
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,140
Why are they so offended?

817
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,840
What did you...

818
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,720
He's...

819
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,840
Melon.

820
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,880
Melon.

821
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,500
You're being...

822
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,180
Melon.

823
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,030
Okay.

824
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,430
Gonzalo.

825
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,790
I think this evening is over.

826
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,690
You've gotta leave.

827
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,850
Oh no!

828
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,110
We'll be fine.

829
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,370
You should just go.

830
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,930
No!

831
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,550
I'm sorry Tripp.

832
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,190
I didn't mean it.

833
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,790
I didn't mean it.

834
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,790
For some reason Melon just makes them like kick you out.

835
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,330
View your generated stage play.

836
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:34,690
Oh.

837
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,530
Cancel.

838
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:36,770
Cancel.

839
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:36,990
Cancel.

840
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,510
It like...

841
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,270
opened up its own document.

842
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:39,930
That's so funny.

843
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,630
Wow guys.

844
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,970
How we get a good feel about that one.

845
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,270
I don't know what...

846
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,010
Melon.

847
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,730
Gonzalo get out of here.

848
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,350
Get out of here.

849
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,470
How we feel about that?

850
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,270
How we feeling?

851
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,510
I think...

852
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,410
I don't...

853
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,570
You need to leave.

854
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,790
Okay.

855
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,270
Replay.

856
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,010
Back to main menu.

857
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,650
To replay, please exit and...

858
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,130
No way.

859
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,190
What?

860
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,850
I have to exit and...

861
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,050
I have to relaunch it every time.

862
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,610
No way!

863
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:24,950
Aww.

864
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,810
Oh, an electronic tip jar.

865
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,170
That's so cute.

866
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,450
Okay.

867
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,170
Let's try... Oh my gosh.

868
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,790
We have 26 seconds every time for it to load.

869
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,790
It has to 60 second generate a new scenario.

870
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,730
I guess that makes sense, right?

871
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,290
Okay.

872
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,430
This next time...

873
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,170
This next time, I think I'm going to genuinely try, okay?

874
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,030
You should say ectoplasm to them.

875
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,950
Not enough kept you waiting, huh?

876
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,030
We're gonna...

877
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,030
Also, I am seeing that there are Streamlabs donos.

878
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,730
I think they're totally backlogged by the members, but I am seeing you guys.

879
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,130
Thank you.

880
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,890
Get melloned, bozo.

881
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,110
Hey!

882
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,310
It's Tripp.

883
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,330
Hey, Tripp.

884
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,590
Uh...

885
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,810
I guess it's been quite some time since we last saw you.

886
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,630
Uh, but uh...

887
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,110
Grace and I thought it'd be great if you came over tonight.

888
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,970
Speak to them in Metal Gear Solid quotes.

889
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,270
We could try that too.

890
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,970
We have many...

891
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,050
We have every scenario we'd ever want to do.

892
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,510
So good!

893
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,670
You could just combine around 8 or something.

894
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,670
Can I skip this?

895
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:45,490
Okay.

896
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,330
I think I can.

897
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,510
I think I just did.

898
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,670
Or, I broke the game.

899
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,010
Never mind.

900
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,530
Look at our happy couple!

901
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:54,770
Yeah!

902
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:55,450
Grace!

903
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,130
Yeah, Tripp!

904
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,670
I thought that was like her boyfriend or something that called.

905
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,190
I was really scared for them.

906
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,670
I... I was scared.

907
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,970
Like, what if she's been seeing another man?

908
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,330
Oh my gosh.

909
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,040
No.

910
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,640
How do I get to Gonzalo again?

911
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,360
I like when they say, Gonzalo!

912
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,160
Melon.

913
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,060
Melon.

914
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,460
Alright, here we go.

915
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,380
Round 2.

916
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,420
I wonder if you can talk to the phone.

917
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:31,800
I tried!

918
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,380
I tried saying hello to my dad.

919
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,700
Tripp, when are you going to get rid of this?

920
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,420
Oh.

921
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,520
Oh, sorry.

922
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,200
I for some reason think that you...

923
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,800
I know, I know.

924
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,100
I'll do it right now, alright?

925
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,760
Oh, he's here!

926
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,300
I'm here!

927
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,780
You said he's coming an hour from now.

928
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,960
No, he's right on time.

929
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,540
Tripp!

930
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,260
Hello?

931
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,820
Open up!

932
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:51,880
Oh!

933
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,320
Gonzalo!

934
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,580
Tripp!

935
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,920
I'm so happy you could make it!

936
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,520
Oh, me too!

937
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,000
Kisses!

938
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,940
Well, come on in.

939
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,440
Okay!

940
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Uh, I'll uh, I'll go get Grace.

941
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,900
Grace, where are you?

942
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,220
No, no, here we are!

943
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,400
What's in here?

944
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,860
Gonzalo?

945
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,080
Yes.

946
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,580
Hi, how are you?

947
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,420
I am so happy to see you after so long!

948
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,220
Yeah, how are you doing?

949
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,260
Sorry, I went to Europe.

950
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,280
Well...

951
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,620
That's where I learned how to kiss.

952
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,780
I learned how to kiss.

953
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,200
Um...

954
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,140
Well, come in.

955
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,120
Make yourself at home.

956
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,660
Oh, close the door.

957
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,900
Yeah, you should do that.

958
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,000
We took a photo from our trip to Italy a couple of weeks ago.

959
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,260
Oh!

960
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:40,920
Italy.

961
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,420
Oh, sorry.

962
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,580
Well, um, come look at this Italy photo.

963
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:46,900
Gonzalo?

964
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,120
Italy.

965
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
Oh, you'll never guess where I took that picture.

966
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,420
Is this really something you want to brag about, Tripp?

967
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,440
Why not?

968
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,360
I'll tell you about it in a sec.

969
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:55,780
Why not?

970
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,180
Why not?

971
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,240
Tell me.

972
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,240
Yeah, yeah, I've got to tell you about Italy.

973
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:00,760
Yes.

974
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,060
Tripp, we don't want to depress our guest.

975
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,240
Damn it, Grace.

976
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,500
Would it kill you to be positive for once?

977
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,760
Shut up, Grace.

978
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,920
Italy!

979
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,200
That's, um...

980
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,680
Gonzalo.

981
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,820
Tell me about Italy.

982
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,020
You had me going there for a sec.

983
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,780
Tell me.

984
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,240
You were afraid to push your luck.

985
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,160
Mess with us.

986
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,440
You're crazy, you know that?

987
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,740
This is going well.

988
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,860
Anyway, what were we talking about?

989
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,400
Italy.

990
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,620
I think I've said Italy five times now.

991
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,760
Please.

992
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,560
So, about my decorating.

993
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,000
What?

994
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,440
We were not talking about that!

995
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,880
You know, I've been collecting these little glass sculptures for a long time now.

996
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,740
Everybody always comments on Grace's sculptures.

997
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,660
Everybody always comments on Grace's sculptures.

998
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,760
But now when I look at them...

999
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,640
They give me such a headache.

1000
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,560
I prefer anime.

1001
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,560
Ah, yes.

1002
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,520
I've been waiting for someone to say that.

1003
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,300
What are you talking about?

1004
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,980
Tripp, he is just being honest about my decorating.

1005
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Which I appreciate.

1006
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,440
I am being honest.

1007
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,900
But I still think this looks fine.

1008
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,320
No.

1009
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,580
Well, you two are all chummy already.

1010
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,780
That's good.

1011
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,740
Hmm.

1012
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,680
Gonzalo, seeing you brings back wonderful memories.

1013
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,120
What does that sound?

1014
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,200
Wow.

1015
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,840
Oh, he grabbed his little magic 8-ball.

1016
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,920
I just realized something.

1017
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,860
What?

1018
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,560
Well, actually, tonight's a special night.

1019
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,060
We should celebrate, in fact.

1020
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,900
What do you mean?

1021
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,800
Gonzalo, remember it was almost exactly 10 years ago tonight that you introduced us?

1022
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,680
Oh, I can hug him!

1023
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,080
You're hugging me.

1024
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,000
That's kind of you.

1025
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,720
I'm sure Tripp's happy to...

1026
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,280
Oh, you're hugging me.

1027
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,520
Oh, that's nice, Grace.

1028
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,940
Our friend seems to be...

1029
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,120
Oh.

1030
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,700
Oh, wow.

1031
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,500
You seem to remember how much Tripp loves getting attention.

1032
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,300
I can't kiss him!

1033
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,120
Uh...

1034
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,840
I'm not gonna let go.

1035
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,740
Keep going.

1036
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,540
All right.

1037
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,480
Gonzalo, that's it.

1038
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,240
No!

1039
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,740
I thought you were down to clown Tripp!

1040
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,280
Don't look at me like that!

1041
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,040
While you kick me out!

1042
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
No, I have to restart the game again!

1043
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,540
No, I have to restart the game again!

1044
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,260
Please!

1045
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,440
No!

1046
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,740
Tripp!

1047
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,880
He...

1048
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,540
He felt something, you know?

1049
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,980
And so he felt that maybe if he didn't kick me out, something new would start.

1050
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,260
After this, he has like a little musical theater moment.

1051
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,140
He's just like...

1052
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,160
I never knew that you saw me like that.

1053
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:02,360
But from this moment I can't stop thinking about the touch of your lips upon mine.

1054
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,820
The kiss button was too strong.

1055
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,980
I had no idea it was there!

1056
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,200
The comfort or the hug.

1057
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,040
I kept cutting them off.

1058
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:10,340
Okay.

1059
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,100
We're gonna be serious.

1060
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,660
We're serious.

1061
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,720
I don't even know how...

1062
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,380
These guys like hate each other.

1063
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,100
How are we supposed...

1064
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,940
I'm not supposed to be in the middle of this.

1065
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,560
Hey!

1066
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,120
It's Tripp!

1067
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,560
Tripp!

1068
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,140
Hey, it's been a while.

1069
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,240
Yeah, you sure are trippin' tonight, mister.

1070
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,920
Grace and I just... I'm just gonna skip it.

1071
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,660
Be the bigger threat.

1072
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,240
Absolutely.

1073
00:34:50,820 --> 00:35:00,480
Also, let me know if like I have to turn up the game volume so you can hear them while I'm playing, cause I turn it down for his little voicemail.

1074
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,340
It's so loud.

1075
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,600
You know what?

1076
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,460
I'm just gonna go with Adam.

1077
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,580
Let's just get into it.

1078
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,400
I'm literally crying from laughing so hard.

1079
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,320
I keep doing this.

1080
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,820
I'm here!

1081
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,000
Hello!

1082
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,740
Open the door!

1083
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,480
It's Mint!

1084
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:28,940
Hi!

1085
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:31,740
Adam!

1086
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,140
Tripp!

1087
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,480
It's been so long since we've seen you!

1088
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,180
Oh, I don't like him calling me Adam.

1089
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,460
How you doing, man?

1090
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,540
I'm good.

1091
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,580
I'm great.

1092
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,680
Great!

1093
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,240
Yeah.

1094
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,960
Wow.

1095
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,860
It's really, really great to see you.

1096
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,940
Well, come on in.

1097
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,640
He likes me.

1098
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,940
Ojamashimasu.

1099
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,500
I'll look at Grace.

1100
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,420
Ojamashimasu.

1101
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,360
What can I do?

1102
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,660
Does this have to happen?

1103
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,460
Are you talking to me?

1104
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,560
I don't think you'd do anything that would challenge your identity.

1105
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,500
Come on.

1106
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,240
Are you talking to me?

1107
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,220
Anything that would challenge your identity.

1108
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,320
Just make me go and try to enjoy myself.

1109
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,980
Oh!

1110
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,760
Adam.

1111
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,980
Hi!

1112
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,200
How are you?

1113
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,060
I am so happy to see you after so long.

1114
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,040
Hi, Grace.

1115
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,140
That's funny.

1116
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,080
I said the same thing.

1117
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:22,500
Hi, Grace.

1118
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,580
And I've got to say, you look really good.

1119
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,200
You too.

1120
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,920
Well, come on in.

1121
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,700
Make yourself...

1122
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,240
What did I say wrong?

1123
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm going to fix us some drinks.

1124
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,640
What did I say wrong?

1125
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,480
Ah, you need to help me break in my expensive new set of cocktail making accessories.

1126
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,020
We should have something fun.

1127
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,480
Like sangria.

1128
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,280
Everybody tells me I fix the best drinks, so I'm sure you're going to love this.

1129
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,820
We love sangria.

1130
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,120
Now, Tripp, don't get too worked up with the drinks.

1131
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:49,920
Perfect.

1132
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,120
No, no.

1133
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,060
Maybe you'd like some juice or mineral water.

1134
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:55,620
Thank you.

1135
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,940
Um, I'll take a hot spicy drink.

1136
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,980
Okay, look.

1137
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm just going to open up a bottle of Merlot and make everybody happy.

1138
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,680
Adam, trust me, it's good stuff.

1139
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,100
Yes, you don't need to push the fancy drinks tonight.

1140
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,240
Oh, I took it first.

1141
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,120
Grace, I assume you want your usual or lovely very cold glass of Chardonnay?

1142
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,760
He can't use it now.

1143
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I took it.

1144
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,940
The Merlot sounds fine.

1145
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,080
Sure thing.

1146
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,460
I took it first.

1147
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,700
I doubt it.

1148
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,160
Ew.

1149
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,100
Sure thing.

1150
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,860
Why not?

1151
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,840
Who knows?

1152
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,320
Yes.

1153
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,240
Alright, guys.

1154
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Ask me a question about your future.

1155
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,760
And I will ask the Magic 8 Ball for its grand wise advice.

1156
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,760
Not advice.

1157
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,700
It's true.

1158
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,620
This is what will happen.

1159
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,380
Pizza tomorrow?

1160
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,560
I doubt it.

1161
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,340
But it's Friday.

1162
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,400
No.

1163
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,060
Is Trip a murderer?

1164
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,880
Maybe later.

1165
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,580
It depends on how well we do here.

1166
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,660
Will I finally find love?

1167
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,480
First Perhaps soon.

1168
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,360
Oh my gosh.

1169
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,380
Oh my gosh.

1170
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,120
Oh my gosh.

1171
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,180
The stakes are high.

1172
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,520
Is Grace evil?

1173
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,040
No.

1174
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,480
Okay.

1175
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,080
Okay.

1176
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Trip or Grace?

1177
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,640
It can't be that.

1178
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,920
It has to be a yes or no question.

1179
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,400
The conch has spoken.

1180
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,560
Can love bloom on the battlefield?

1181
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,240
Who knows?

1182
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,500
Who knows?

1183
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,940
I love this thing.

1184
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,040
You're a little close to me, Grace.

1185
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,700
How's the weather?

1186
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,890
I'll ask the 8 Ball.

1187
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,090
Is the weather good?

1188
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,370
Perhaps soon.

1189
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,270
How do I put this down?

1190
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,990
Oh, dang it.

1191
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,710
I did it again.

1192
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,020
What's he doing?

1193
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,440
Oh, well.

1194
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,160
Thanks.

1195
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,640
Adam, you're always so sweet.

1196
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,980
Grace, I'm giving you the first glass.

1197
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,200
Why did you cut her off like that?

1198
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,040
Nope.

1199
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,320
That glass is mine.

1200
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,140
Adam, I was going...

1201
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,060
Oh, I'll get it.

1202
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,780
Sippy, sippy.

1203
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,660
We can let the answering machine get it.

1204
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
You know what?

1205
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,580
I'm just going to put this in the bathroom.

1206
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,700
How did you walk in front of us?

1207
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,760
Sippy, sippy.

1208
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,140
I'm drunk.

1209
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,880
Oh, yeah, you know.

1210
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,140
I think I'll fix you a real drink in not too long.

1211
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,080
Anyhow.

1212
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,300
Hey, you've reached the fabulous...

1213
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Oh, my God.

1214
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,200
Everyone is talking.

1215
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:17,620
Please.

1216
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,260
Travis, are you there?

1217
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,540
It's your mother.

1218
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,180
I haven't heard from you and Grace in a while.

1219
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,480
Take a look at this photo I just put up from our trip to Italy.

1220
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,980
I'm just calling to find out if you're settled in in your new apartment.

1221
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,640
That's all.

1222
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,220
Adam, come over here and sit on my couch with me.

1223
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,460
Can you call if you're not traveling?

1224
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,780
I know you're traveling a lot these days.

1225
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
Everyone is talking!

1226
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,160
Who is Travis?

1227
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,660
Oh, Tripp, don't put our friend on the spot like that.

1228
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,140
Well, actually, this trip to Italy was meant to be our second honeymoon.

1229
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,480
Well, actually, this trip to Italy was meant to be our second honeymoon.

1230
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,680
Tripp, don't exaggerate.

1231
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,700
It was simply a weekend getaway.

1232
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,180
So, in a word, this says...

1233
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,020
It says...

1234
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,480
Love.

1235
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,240
It says love.

1236
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:58,780
Oh.

1237
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,560
Or not.

1238
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,760
He doesn't believe.

1239
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,360
I don't know.

1240
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,060
Travis is Tripp's full name.

1241
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,400
Oh.

1242
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,980
Romance!

1243
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,320
It says romance.

1244
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,340
Romance!

1245
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,920
Of course!

1246
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,740
Yeah.

1247
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,320
Oh.

1248
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,520
Never mind.

1249
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:14,820
What?

1250
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,720
That's what you said!

1251
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,760
Could be.

1252
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,680
Could be.

1253
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,280
Good one.

1254
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,460
Yeah.

1255
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:23,900
Yeah.

1256
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,520
Why am I the awkward one here?

1257
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,340
Uh...

1258
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,480
Adam.

1259
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,620
Maybe you didn't come here to hear this.

1260
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,120
What?

1261
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,860
Uh-oh.

1262
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,140
Uh-oh.

1263
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,740
Tripp, there's nothing wrong with disagreeing in front of our friend.

1264
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,500
Disagreeing?

1265
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,980
We're not disagreeing.

1266
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,320
Uh-oh.

1267
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,660
Uh-oh.

1268
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,620
Oh.

1269
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,420
We're not.

1270
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:45,960
No.

1271
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,040
Everything...

1272
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,500
Everything is good.

1273
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,880
What?

1274
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,360
What?

1275
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,180
You know, ever since we got married, Tripp is forever trying to get me to buy new furniture and redecorate.

1276
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,720
Everything is not good.

1277
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,500
Everything is...

1278
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,220
And it's true.

1279
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,120
I kind of enjoy it, but...

1280
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,200
Oh, yeah.

1281
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:58,780
It's great.

1282
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,880
Everybody loves it when they come in and see our latest decoration scheme.

1283
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,040
But... Adam.

1284
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,620
Yes?

1285
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,100
You have to look at this room and admit it looks terrible.

1286
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,160
It looks great!

1287
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,800
I mean, look around.

1288
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,040
This room is... it's hideous.

1289
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,580
Ah, yeah.

1290
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,500
It looks great!

1291
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,220
Adam, I knew you'd like it.

1292
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,440
Yeah!

1293
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,940
See, Grace?

1294
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,920
You don't realize how good all this looks.

1295
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,300
It's a little empty.

1296
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,360
Could've used some more wall scrolls or something.

1297
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:20,860
And how good you look.

1298
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,100
So, about my decorating.

1299
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,160
You know, at work I waste all day designing ads for apartments like this.

1300
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,660
Uh-huh.

1301
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,880
And it makes me think, I want this style for my apartment.

1302
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,260
Yeah?

1303
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,720
This style makes me feel like I'm inside one of your ads.

1304
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,200
It's great.

1305
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,080
Oh, I'm sitting.

1306
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,600
But, damn it, I'm wrong.

1307
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,740
It's just not coming together at all.

1308
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,380
That's okay.

1309
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,140
Not coming together?

1310
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,660
What?

1311
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,220
What's going on?

1312
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,480
Why is she so angry?

1313
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,360
Really?

1314
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,200
Oh.

1315
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,160
You're hugging me.

1316
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,120
It's good to see you two bonding again.

1317
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,200
I'm comforting you.

1318
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,620
I'm comforting you.

1319
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,780
Well, you're really affectionate tonight, aren't you?

1320
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,320
I'm drunk.

1321
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,110
She's a villain.

1322
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,130
I can return most of this and start over again on this room.

1323
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:11,990
Are you okay?

1324
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,810
I love this...

1325
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,730
No, I can't say love or else they'll say I'm...

1326
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,770
They think I'm loving...

1327
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,770
The room looks great.

1328
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,050
What?

1329
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,070
Aha.

1330
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,250
I knew it.

1331
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,270
I was right, Grace.

1332
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,070
You're the only one unhappy with your decorating.

1333
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:27,770
No.

1334
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,590
Decorating is not...

1335
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,210
It's not...

1336
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:30,770
Not...

1337
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,030
Grace, come on.

1338
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,170
You're so good at it.

1339
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:34,890
You're so good.

1340
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,830
Oh my god, we're helping you guys.

1341
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:38,850
I think we're actually helping.

1342
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,090
Ugh, you are impossible.

1343
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,510
Or not.

1344
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:42,830
I'm never happy.

1345
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,410
Tripp, our whole marriage is so...

1346
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,330
I don't think we're helping.

1347
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,350
What?

1348
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,370
He's not doing anything.

1349
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,510
What's wrong, Grace?

1350
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,210
What's wrong?

1351
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,730
Adam, I...

1352
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,250
And you...

1353
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,750
I can predict what you'll say.

1354
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,210
Me?

1355
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,650
You're so positive tonight.

1356
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,930
It's driving me crazy.

1357
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:02,250
Um...

1358
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,050
Uh, what should I say, you guys?

1359
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,110
More real.

1360
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,990
I like my fancy drinks, okay?

1361
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:08,470
Oh my god.

1362
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,230
What should I say?

1363
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,250
I like the good things in life.

1364
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,590
Does that make me a bad person?

1365
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,410
They're just drinks!

1366
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,250
Goddamn second honeymoon.

1367
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,810
You never call me when you're on business trips.

1368
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,230
You never call me, you know that?

1369
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,150
Um, um, what do I say?

1370
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,690
Something positive?

1371
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,390
Okay, you know what?

1372
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,750
I'll take another drink.

1373
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,750
I need to ask you something.

1374
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:31,010
Grace, Tripp, let me ask our guest a question.

1375
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,930
Never mind, they ignored me.

1376
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,230
Adam.

1377
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:34,770
Yes.

1378
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:35,630
Yes or no?

1379
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,510
In a marriage, shouldn't you try to help the other person get what they want?

1380
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:42,350
In a marriage, shouldn't you try to help the other person get what they want?

1381
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,490
What?

1382
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:49,210
I mean, marriage is supposed to be about what the other person wants, not what you want, right?

1383
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,470
Yes or no?

1384
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:51,910
Um...

1385
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:53,710
Uh...

1386
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:54,750
Yes.

1387
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,930
Let's just agree with her.

1388
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,310
Why are you upset?

1389
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,390
Oh, yeah.

1390
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,790
That's fine.

1391
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,830
That's fine.

1392
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,670
You should both...

1393
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,890
I tried so hard to reach out to you, Grace.

1394
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,750
You reject me.

1395
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,630
You're cold.

1396
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,550
You're distant.

1397
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,470
It's killing me.

1398
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,710
You're tearing me apart, Lisa.

1399
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:16,670
Go away.

1400
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,150
I don't want to look at you.

1401
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,810
Damn it, Tripp.

1402
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,650
Are we still doing...

1403
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,230
BBQ?

1404
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,770
What are you saying?

1405
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:29,890
What?

1406
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,050
Grace, what the hell are you saying about me in there?

1407
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,430
Wait, I'm in here.

1408
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:35,810
I'm sorry.

1409
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,450
This is a disaster.

1410
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,410
No, no.

1411
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,350
I'm having fun.

1412
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,490
I'm having fun.

1413
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:42,590
Please.

1414
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:48,190
Adam, from what you said before about saying yes, I think we've already learned something about Grace.

1415
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:48,910
Oh.

1416
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,710
We're talking about me again, are we?

1417
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:51,950
She's getting the gun.

1418
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,950
There's no gun.

1419
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,970
We don't have to do this.

1420
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:54,750
Things are okay.

1421
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,430
I can't stand the pretending anymore.

1422
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,830
I can't take it.

1423
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,090
Get away from the window, Grace.

1424
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:02,930
Okay.

1425
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:03,970
Sorry.

1426
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,590
I think this evening is over.

1427
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,510
You've got to leave.

1428
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,430
No!

1429
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,470
I was helping!

1430
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,510
Just go.

1431
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,210
No!

1432
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,670
What did I do?

1433
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,960
Oh, man.

1434
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,880
They are so...

1435
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,980
We were helping!

1436
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,440
What's wrong with being a little positive?

1437
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,200
Is there actually a good ending?

1438
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,140
I have no idea.

1439
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,340
The fact that each scenario is different too is crazy.

1440
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,920
My drink.

1441
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,840
Hey, at least we finished our drink, right?

1442
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:48,140
I think I should be like a hostage negotiator.

1443
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,360
I think, actually, maybe this game will train you for hostage negotiation situations.

1444
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,500
Because only the bad outcomes happen.

1445
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,160
And so it trains you to not say those things.

1446
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,380
Mhm.

1447
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,880
What if I say Okay.

1448
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,960
I'm gonna go in with this approach.

1449
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,940
I'm gonna say, I just got a new job as a man.

1450
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,100
I'm a marriage counsellor.

1451
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,900
Then they feel safe.

1452
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,920
Trauma dumping on me.

1453
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,600
And then I say I charge $150 an hour.

1454
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,000
Then I also get paid for it.

1455
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,620
Stonks.

1456
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,380
Mint as a hostage negotiator.

1457
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,680
So, it'll be great.

1458
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,100
Oh, sorry.

1459
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:47,460
I forgot.

1460
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,340
I can skip this part.

1461
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:55,040
A guy got the good ending and completed the game by being rude and not giving a crap the entire time first try?

1462
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,940
No way.

1463
00:47:59,360 --> 00:47:59,720
Okay.

1464
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,700
I can be a jerk.

1465
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,540
I can't... well, you have to be like the right level of jerk.

1466
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,720
Because if you're just like, shut up Grace.

1467
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,700
What if I don't say anything the entire time?

1468
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,420
What if I like...

1469
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,740
What if I just...

1470
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,720
What if I just stand there?

1471
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,480
What if I don't say anything?

1472
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,300
Let's try it.

1473
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,740
Let's try it.

1474
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,940
Sorry that the subtitles seem a little bit like, inconsistent, but...

1475
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,320
That's the best we can do.

1476
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,620
Oh, gosh.

1477
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,420
I did it again.

1478
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,040
Wah!

1479
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:34,840
Wah!

1480
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,860
I'm here!

1481
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,040
Open the door.

1482
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,680
Gonzalo!

1483
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,380
Hey!

1484
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:51,980
Tripp!

1485
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,380
I thought I heard someone out here.

1486
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,160
Great to see...

1487
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,860
Oh.

1488
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,400
Well, come on in.

1489
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,160
Wait.

1490
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,160
What happened?

1491
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,360
It'll be just a sec while I go get Grace.

1492
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,920
Tripp, I'm stuck in the door!

1493
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,000
Tripp!

1494
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,280
Tripp, I... Oh, okay.

1495
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,600
Nevermind.

1496
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,180
I was gonna say, Tripp, I can't come in.

1497
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,360
Let us sit down.

1498
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,780
Put on a happy face.

1499
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,700
I don't understand why you're always doing this to me.

1500
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,720
Grace, we do this later...

1501
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,220
Can I make a little phone call real quick?

1502
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,080
I'm ready.

1503
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:27,600
You just...

1504
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,860
No new messages.

1505
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:30,900
Oh!

1506
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,920
I didn't do anything.

1507
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:33,980
Gonzalo?

1508
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:34,960
Hi!

1509
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,240
How are you?

1510
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,960
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

1511
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,400
It feels like it's been forever.

1512
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,120
Yeah!

1513
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,380
Yeah, it has been a long time.

1514
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,180
Hide the ball?

1515
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,680
So true.

1516
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,880
Oh, I'm... there.

1517
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,940
Well, come on in.

1518
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,400
Make yourself at home.

1519
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:46,980
Oh, that!

1520
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,480
That's just a little joke advice giver toy thing that I like to consult every now and then.

1521
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,180
Let's put it in the kitchen.

1522
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,680
When I need a little guidance.

1523
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,060
His mother gave that to him.

1524
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,220
Stocking stuffer.

1525
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,580
Stocking stuffer.

1526
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,200
Oh.

1527
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,260
Well...

1528
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:00,560
If I can.

1529
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,980
So, make yourself at home.

1530
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:02,700
I am!

1531
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,160
I am!

1532
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:03,540
I am!

1533
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,300
I'm taking your stuff.

1534
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,100
Oh, close the door.

1535
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,240
Oh, good, good.

1536
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,760
Oh!

1537
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:07,800
Gonzalo!

1538
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,320
Yeah!

1539
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,400
Take a look at this photo I just put up from our trip to Italy.

1540
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,920
Wow, we're already getting into it.

1541
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,840
Little solid.

1542
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,180
Gonzalo!

1543
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:14,460
Yeah!

1544
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:14,700
Come here.

1545
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,480
I want you to...

1546
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,380
Gonzalo.

1547
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,440
Come over here and sit on the couch with me.

1548
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,580
Oh, they're making me choose.

1549
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,340
No, hold on.

1550
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:20,340
Now.

1551
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,180
Actually, I'm gonna go sit on the couch with him.

1552
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,880
Trip darling, your obsession with that photo is making our friend uncomfortable.

1553
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,900
I'm very uncomfortable.

1554
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,420
Romance.

1555
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,260
It says romance.

1556
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,420
Where?

1557
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,820
I'm gonna fix us some drinks.

1558
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,140
Oh, and I've got these fancy new cocktail shakers.

1559
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,420
No!

1560
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,100
He got it!

1561
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,880
That was a martini sound.

1562
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,740
I'm a real expert at fixing these.

1563
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,300
At least that's what everyone tells me.

1564
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,120
Uh-huh.

1565
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,220
Trip, let's not go crazy with the drinks, okay?

1566
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,000
Yeah.

1567
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,820
It says Italy.

1568
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,720
Italy.

1569
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,060
It's a... it's really... it's really...

1570
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,220
Well, you know what?

1571
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,620
I'm just gonna make you a martini.

1572
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,180
No, no, Gonzalo.

1573
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,240
Maybe you'd like some juice or mineral water.

1574
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,610
You know, I'm just gonna open up a bottle of Merlot or something.

1575
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,870
I just want us to be relaxed and enjoy ourselves tonight.

1576
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:17,290
I'm not saying anything, you guys.

1577
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:17,510
Yeah.

1578
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:17,730
Yes.

1579
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:22,150
Sometimes a simple glass of wine is better than those fancy drinks you always insist on making.

1580
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,630
This one looks like a Yu-Gi-Oh!

1581
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,370
character, right?

1582
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:24,550
What do you say, Grace?

1583
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,150
I know it's not true.

1584
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,030
This one right here.

1585
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,770
Oh, do you like those sculptures?

1586
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:28,510
Oh, uh-oh.

1587
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,690
I used to be so into collecting them.

1588
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:32,730
Into them?

1589
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,330
You love your sculptures so much, I'm not even allowed to touch them.

1590
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:39,170
Trip, your poker buddies used them as ashtrays.

1591
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,010
What?

1592
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,830
Anyhow, Gonzalo...

1593
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:42,750
What do you mean, anyhow?

1594
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:43,650
Trip!

1595
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,690
He says, no, I'm not.

1596
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,230
As for my drink...

1597
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,070
Yeah, it does look like the...

1598
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:46,930
Yeah, the harpy.

1599
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,630
Um, I'll have a glass of Merlot, too.

1600
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:50,130
Oh.

1601
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:51,730
Good.

1602
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,430
Good.

1603
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:52,710
Okay.

1604
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,110
Okay.

1605
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:53,790
Good.

1606
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,470
Big sigh.

1607
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,010
Oh, God.

1608
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,930
Why are we big sigh...

1609
00:51:58,930 --> 00:51:59,390
Gonzalo.

1610
00:51:59,550 --> 00:51:59,870
Yes?

1611
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,750
I hope you didn't come here tonight to be entertained.

1612
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:02,650
What?

1613
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,330
What?

1614
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,030
Here, Grace.

1615
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,530
I poured you the first glass.

1616
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,590
Okay, thanks.

1617
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:08,610
Anyway...

1618
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,050
Oh, she just walked through the...

1619
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:10,090
Grace, come on.

1620
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,870
That kind of statement is not helpful.

1621
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,070
Trip, there's nothing wrong with disagreeing in front of our friends.

1622
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:15,210
Disagree?

1623
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:15,750
We're not.

1624
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,350
They're talking over each other again.

1625
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:19,610
Sheesh.

1626
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,050
Well...

1627
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:20,570
Sheesh.

1628
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,430
You two are all chummy already.

1629
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,150
That's...

1630
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:23,650
That's good.

1631
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,990
You know, ever since we got married, I can't help it.

1632
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,490
I'm forever buying new furniture and redecorating.

1633
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,190
They're just going off on their own.

1634
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,070
I don't need to do anything.

1635
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,090
It's in your blood.

1636
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,650
You grew up with this stuff.

1637
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:35,270
Sheesh.

1638
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,570
Here you are.

1639
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,630
So, I normally like redecorating, Gonzalo.

1640
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,270
Now, be honest with me.

1641
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,830
Agree that this room just does not work.

1642
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,050
He's going to kick you out.

1643
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:45,190
He's going to kick you out.

1644
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,610
Come on.

1645
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,850
What are you talking about?

1646
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:46,470
I'm not saying anything.

1647
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,410
Well, I'll just put this on the bar for you.

1648
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,050
Thank you.

1649
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:51,990
So, about my decorating?

1650
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,450
All day at work, I design ads for decorative objects.

1651
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,090
Like these sculptures.

1652
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:58,070
Right.

1653
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:58,550
Sculptures.

1654
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,330
And then I think I want to design them into my apartment.

1655
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:01,990
Oh, yeah.

1656
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:02,410
Yeah.

1657
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:04,590
Everybody always says how much they love Grace's sculptures.

1658
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:05,890
But...

1659
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:07,370
But...

1660
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,810
Gonzalo, you've not said a single word for a while now.

1661
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,250
Are you alright?

1662
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,050
They've noticed.

1663
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,650
They've noticed.

1664
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,430
Just...

1665
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1666
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:18,930
Just watch.

1667
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,510
Oh, good.

1668
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,150
Oh.

1669
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:20,490
Oh.

1670
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,710
I'm sure I can return most of this and try to start over again on this room.

1671
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,860
Grace, everything's fine.

1672
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,720
No one is complaining about your decorating.

1673
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,440
No.

1674
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,420
He is just being courteous.

1675
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,460
This room is not...

1676
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,720
Grace, come on.

1677
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,600
People like it.

1678
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,940
You're the only one...

1679
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,220
You know, Tripp, if you hadn't convinced me to go into advertising, I could have painted that painting on the wall instead of buying it.

1680
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,720
Oh, my God.

1681
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,020
This is so...

1682
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,940
They are...

1683
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,560
Never happy.

1684
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,160
Oh.

1685
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,420
You're driving me insane.

1686
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,760
You're goddamn decorating.

1687
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,340
You're both insufferable.

1688
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:01,800
You're never satisfied with anything.

1689
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,180
Huh?

1690
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:03,680
What?

1691
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,040
What?

1692
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,420
What was that?

1693
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,040
Gonzalo, can you believe this?

1694
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,020
Oh, I cannot.

1695
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,020
I cannot believe this.

1696
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:13,460
Gonzalo.

1697
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,200
Uh...

1698
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,900
Can you...

1699
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,240
Can you...

1700
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,920
Can you just...

1701
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,100
Goddamn manipulation.

1702
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,840
Manipulation Station.

1703
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,720
Grace, I just wanna be alone.

1704
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:20,820
I just wanna be alone.

1705
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:20,860
I just wanna be alone.

1706
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,580
I'm stuck, Grace.

1707
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,200
Can you see that?

1708
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,760
Can we just do that?

1709
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,700
I'm stuck.

1710
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,980
Here, I'm gonna also not face him.

1711
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,120
Alright.

1712
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,300
You know what?

1713
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,360
Gonzalo, I need to ask you something.

1714
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:32,820
Okay.

1715
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,320
Yeah.

1716
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,740
Grace, let me ask our guest a question.

1717
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,120
Okay.

1718
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,040
Ask away.

1719
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,640
Gonzalo, yes or no?

1720
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,500
Oh.

1721
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,860
If one person in a marriage gives the other advice, and that advice is taken, years later, can you be blamed for that?

1722
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,380
Oh my god.

1723
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:49,720
What?

1724
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:55,840
Is it okay to get blamed for giving advice that was taken, like, ten years ago?

1725
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,720
Yes or no?

1726
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,120
Um, yeah, let's check the eight ball.

1727
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,120
Could be.

1728
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,300
Look, don't bother answering.

1729
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,860
I don't need to hear it.

1730
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,560
Okay, nevermind.

1731
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,280
It was too late.

1732
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,240
I keep trying to help you, Grace, but you reject me.

1733
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:14,780
Oh my god.

1734
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,520
You're tearing me apart.

1735
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:15,700
You cut me off.

1736
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,180
You cut me out of your life.

1737
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,480
God damn it!

1738
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Oh my god, he's so loud.

1739
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,760
Ugh, yeah, good.

1740
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,800
Get away from me.

1741
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,060
I don't want to look at you.

1742
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,800
I'm gonna comfort her.

1743
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,620
Damn it, Tripp!

1744
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:25,920
Oh, nevermind.

1745
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,020
Come here, come here, come here.

1746
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,160
I don't want to kiss you on accident.

1747
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,900
No, wait, please.

1748
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:30,780
What?

1749
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,440
Are you talking about me?

1750
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,600
I'm not talking to you.

1751
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:36,920
Gonzalo...

1752
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,060
I can't believe you have to see this.

1753
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,820
Um, me neither.

1754
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:49,100
Gonzalo, in what you said before about marriage, I think that tells us something about Tripp.

1755
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:49,500
So true.

1756
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,180
Oh, we're talking about me, are we?

1757
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:51,740
What?

1758
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,520
Oh, he's back!

1759
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,540
Grace, we don't... we don't have to do this.

1760
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,320
Things are okay.

1761
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,140
We can just...

1762
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:56,160
Gonzalo.

1763
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,000
I can't stand the pretending anymore.

1764
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,380
I can't take it.

1765
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,240
Me neither.

1766
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,500
Me neither.

1767
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,000
No, Grace, we can... I mean, come on.

1768
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,100
Don't make it out to be so bad.

1769
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:07,860
She's so angry!

1770
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:08,460
Ugh.

1771
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm on Grace's side right now.

1772
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:12,840
What is it?

1773
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,880
Is there something about me?

1774
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,260
Um...

1775
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,280
Look, why don't we talk about us?

1776
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,160
Our relationship.

1777
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,460
Hmm.

1778
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,800
It's so annoying.

1779
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,740
Grace, why is it that any time I want to do something nice for you, you resist it?

1780
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:24,820
Tripp...

1781
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,460
Like I always have to convince you.

1782
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,020
Gonzalo, you know...

1783
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,160
Oh, no.

1784
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,900
I can't drink it.

1785
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,220
Ugh.

1786
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:30,660
Oh, I can!

1787
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
And drink all his... wine.

1788
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,460
Yeah?

1789
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,440
Well, you were...

1790
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,420
All this stuff...

1791
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,940
You were in the middle of a sentence there.

1792
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,380
Having all this money makes us so happy.

1793
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,860
We're so happy, aren't we, Tripp?

1794
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,660
Jesus, what do you want?

1795
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,360
Now you're unhappy because we're...

1796
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,020
Ugh, that brass bowl.

1797
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,760
It's just so infuriating.

1798
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,500
What's wrong with the bowl?

1799
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,000
Watch how you put that goddamn gift on display in our own living room.

1800
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,120
Who... who gifted this?

1801
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,600
God, Gonzalo.

1802
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,720
I'm getting really tired of talking about Tripp's stuff.

1803
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,000
Oh, sorry.

1804
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,120
Um, let's talk about anime.

1805
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,000
Ah.

1806
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,020
Gonzalo?

1807
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,320
Yeah?

1808
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,820
You're saying I don't communicate?

1809
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,460
Wait, that's not... Komi-san doesn't communicate?

1810
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,980
I reach out to Grace.

1811
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,500
Is this your favorite anime?

1812
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:18,840
I really do.

1813
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,800
I try to be open and honest, you know?

1814
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,600
Gonzalo.

1815
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,320
Stop.

1816
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:24,680
Oh, my God.

1817
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,660
What if...

1818
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,220
Uh... uh... communication sucks.

1819
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,300
No, communication... communication.

1820
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,360
See, Grace?

1821
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,880
I feel like it's you that's not reaching out.

1822
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,480
Ugh.

1823
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,980
Ugh.

1824
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:46,440
Um... you... you both are bad at talking.

1825
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:47,880
Aha!

1826
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,800
Gonzalo, you're saying I'm communicative?

1827
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,980
You know, Tripp, whenever I really try to talk honestly about things, you don't want to hear it.

1828
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,780
No, I said you're both bad about it.

1829
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,380
What?

1830
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,520
Gonzalo, I think I'm the only one who is trying to be the most honest here.

1831
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,140
Gonzalo.

1832
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:04,300
Duh.

1833
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,300
Duh.

1834
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,980
Um, be honest about your feeling.

1835
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,400
Yes?

1836
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,020
Look, you're doing it again.

1837
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,600
You're putting this all on me.

1838
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,480
I can't.

1839
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,420
I'm just trying to help you.

1840
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:16,680
Can I help you, man?

1841
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,180
Gonzalo?

1842
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:18,700
Yes?

1843
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,060
If there's something about me, just tell me what it is.

1844
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,760
Um, let's see.

1845
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,640
Let's keep talking about Grace.

1846
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,760
Gonzalo, look around this apartment.

1847
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,460
It's got everything anyone would ever want.

1848
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,120
But Grace?

1849
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,760
Oh no, she's never satisfied.

1850
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,400
Tripp, ugh.

1851
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,300
I'm so sick of this.

1852
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,800
You complain too much.

1853
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,260
I don't think...

1854
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,720
Well, I mean... we've got everything.

1855
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,140
Tripp, you just don't... ugh.

1856
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,720
You don't have love.

1857
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:50,460
Ah.

1858
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,600
What the hell are you talking about?

1859
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,660
That makes no sense.

1860
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,880
Okay.

1861
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,420
Gonzalo.

1862
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:57,840
Yes?

1863
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,200
If there's something about me, just tell me what it is.

1864
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,000
You're... annoying.

1865
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,300
Aha.

1866
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,800
Gonzalo, you're saying I'm angry?

1867
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,660
No, I said...

1868
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,100
It makes me so angry.

1869
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:08,620
Angry?

1870
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:08,800
What?

1871
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,680
Gonzalo, did I ever tell you how she humiliated me at a gallery in front of her artist friends?

1872
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,060
What?

1873
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,040
What did you do?

1874
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,060
What did she do?

1875
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,400
What?

1876
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,200
What?

1877
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,540
Tripp, whatever I really said, I'm sure you deserved it.

1878
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:23,860
Ugh.

1879
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:24,700
Ugh.

1880
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:25,700
What?

1881
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:26,940
Hold on.

1882
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,440
Let's keep our focus on Tripp.

1883
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:28,840
No.

1884
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,780
Tripp, it's your fault.

1885
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:37,120
Ten years ago, freshly married and just out of college, you convinced me to go into advertising instead of art.

1886
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:37,760
What?

1887
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,060
If it weren't for you, I could be a real artist by now.

1888
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,160
She's blaming him?

1889
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,180
That was your decision.

1890
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:43,640
Gonzalo.

1891
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:43,740
Ugh.

1892
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:48,000
That... that was your decision, Grace.

1893
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:49,940
That's bullshit.

1894
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:50,480
Oh.

1895
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:50,700
Ugh.

1896
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,700
No, I'm on your side.

1897
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,560
No, we need... we need to talk about us both, not just one.

1898
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,400
What makes me the most angry, Tripp, is what you took away from me.

1899
00:59:59,520 --> 00:59:59,800
What?

1900
00:59:59,800 --> 00:59:59,960
What?

1901
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,000
I wasted ten years in this marriage...

1902
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,820
You can still be an artist.

1903
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:05,600
Making advertising...

1904
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,660
What's wrong with advertising?

1905
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:06,920
See...

1906
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,380
Gonzalo.

1907
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,640
All this time, I just can't stop thinking that I should have been painting.

1908
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,660
Why don't you just do it then?

1909
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,700
That's what I'm saying.

1910
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:15,760
Just...

1911
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,920
Be a goddamn artist already.

1912
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:18,200
Just do it.

1913
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,040
Yes?

1914
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,480
Ah, yes.

1915
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,620
Just you saying that should really help her.

1916
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,340
Well, if I could be a painter, I... I would.

1917
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,040
Look, let's not focus on just me or you.

1918
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,460
Let's talk about us.

1919
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,420
Oh my god, I think we're actually getting somewhere here, you guys.

1920
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,660
You just pretend to like all this stuff.

1921
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,220
Fancy cigars and fine wine.

1922
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,900
You think I'm not good enough.

1923
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,440
I never said that.

1924
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,080
I'm saying there's more to you than all this.

1925
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:45,720
All?

1926
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,720
What else is there?

1927
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:49,780
What?

1928
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,440
Than...

1929
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,020
Gonzalo.

1930
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:51,980
Thank you.

1931
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,260
That helps us.

1932
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:53,600
It does?

1933
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:59,120
Tripp, I know that you like to hang out at that little sports bar on the corner.

1934
01:00:59,480 --> 01:00:59,700
What?

1935
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,200
What?

1936
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:00,820
Not...

1937
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,220
No.

1938
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,500
Why did he...

1939
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,520
Tripp, it's all right.

1940
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,620
The way he moved closer.

1941
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,860
The sports bar.

1942
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,160
Why?

1943
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,360
Oh god.

1944
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,820
This is so frigging insane.

1945
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,120
I love sports.

1946
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,560
Ugh, you...

1947
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,300
Does anyone...

1948
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,020
Um...

1949
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,240
Okay, that's it.

1950
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,520
No more of this bullshit.

1951
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,680
Gonzalo, I know what you're hinting at.

1952
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:31,980
About us.

1953
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,500
Oh, no.

1954
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:32,920
What?

1955
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,900
About our lifestyle.

1956
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,380
What?

1957
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,880
Do you two want the truth?

1958
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:37,300
Huh?

1959
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,000
Okay.

1960
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,260
Give us the truth.

1961
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,340
Gonzalo, I know what you're hinting at.

1962
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:40,540
Listen.

1963
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,400
Do you want to hear it?

1964
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,280
Yes.

1965
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,560
Grace?

1966
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,160
Yes.

1967
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,920
See, Gonzalo, I've been paying attention to what you've been saying tonight.

1968
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:50,300
Okay.

1969
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,100
You've been really pushing me tonight.

1970
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,340
I'm a pusher.

1971
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,820
It makes me wonder if you're really my friend or not.

1972
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:58,780
Tripp?

1973
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,680
Gonzalo?

1974
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,840
Quit interrupting me.

1975
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,340
Let me finish.

1976
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,080
Gonzalo, come on.

1977
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,780
Yes or no?

1978
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:15,040
Do you really think that saying that Grace is communicative, telling me I'm not communicative, telling Grace to make art, that will somehow realize something about our marriage?

1979
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:15,620
Yes.

1980
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,540
Is all of that arguing intended to mean something?

1981
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,080
Yes.

1982
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:18,260
Right.

1983
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,200
Yes.

1984
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:21,940
Realize.

1985
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,200
Grace.

1986
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,160
Realize your power.

1987
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:30,140
See, I'm ashamed of my parents.

1988
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,360
Where is this coming from?

1989
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,200
What?

1990
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,120
Your parents are great.

1991
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,320
I love seeing them.

1992
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:37,860
I know.

1993
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,460
I know.

1994
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,500
But yours, they're so ignorant.

1995
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,720
But they're real.

1996
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,880
I hate how my parents are pretending to be something.

1997
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,680
I've tried hard to be like your family.

1998
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:48,960
Tripp, really?

1999
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:49,500
What?

2000
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,060
I don't...

2001
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,460
But I feel like a phony.

2002
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:52,900
Phony.

2003
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,020
Phony.

2004
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,520
I feel like I can never get rid of my past.

2005
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:54,740
Phony.

2006
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,640
What's your past?

2007
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,280
What happened?

2008
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,020
What happened?

2009
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,680
It's kind of like I don't know who I am anymore.

2010
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,020
What are you talking about?

2011
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,380
This guy needs therapy.

2012
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:05,960
Oh.

2013
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:07,980
Let's go.

2014
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,640
Oh my God.

2015
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,400
Drop a melon.

2016
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:09,560
Drop a melon.

2017
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:09,660
Drop a melon.

2018
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,060
I'm going to give you the truth too, Tripp.

2019
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,660
See, they're being honest with each other.

2020
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,160
I painted this.

2021
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:21,840
Yes.

2022
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:22,520
Bullshit.

2023
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,520
I am an artist, Tripp.

2024
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,360
Fuck you.

2025
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,680
It's beautiful.

2026
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:30,820
You've been secretly painting?

2027
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:31,740
What's wrong with...

2028
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,260
Every time you go on a goddamn business trip, I paint.

2029
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,380
What's wrong with painting?

2030
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,080
So don't ever give me any more of your...

2031
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,400
You could never be an artist.

2032
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,020
Crap.

2033
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,520
What's wrong with art?

2034
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,340
Why?

2035
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,240
It's MSP.

2036
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,380
It's so...

2037
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,060
Oh, I'm sitting again.

2038
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:52,760
I'm up again.

2039
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,040
Jesus.

2040
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:53,960
Okay.

2041
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,600
Gonzalo.

2042
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,940
Grace, I have one more thing to say.

2043
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:58,660
Again?

2044
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,160
Again?

2045
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,280
What?

2046
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:03,700
What?

2047
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,480
Grace.

2048
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,240
I know you want to be an artist.

2049
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:06,840
Yes.

2050
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,320
But...

2051
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:08,880
Gonzalo.

2052
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,000
I have one more thing to say.

2053
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,760
You could never be married to you if you were.

2054
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:11,860
What?

2055
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,200
Why not?

2056
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:14,920
I can't.

2057
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,680
I just can't.

2058
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,300
But Tripp...

2059
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:21,200
When I married you, see, I was sure I could convince you to give it up.

2060
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,400
To go into advertising.

2061
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,300
What's so special about advertising?

2062
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:24,660
And I did it.

2063
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,400
And it worked.

2064
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,540
But now...

2065
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,000
I don't know, Grace.

2066
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,860
What is wrong with Tripp?

2067
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,420
I don't know.

2068
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,020
Why do you hate art?

2069
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,360
I don't know.

2070
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:38,480
I don't know.

2071
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:38,540
I don't know.

2072
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:38,600
I don't know.

2073
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:39,860
I don't know.

2074
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,860
Tripp, what is wrong with you?

2075
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:42,720
Oh, my God.

2076
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,040
That's how I feel.

2077
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,860
This changes everything.

2078
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:51,920
Yeah.

2079
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,620
Are you...

2080
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,720
You...

2081
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,620
You really have to be an artist.

2082
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,460
Oh.

2083
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,760
Oh, my God.

2084
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,940
You finally admitted it.

2085
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,240
You just don't want me to be an artist.

2086
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:04,360
Why?

2087
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,660
You're so...

2088
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,120
What?

2089
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:06,840
You...

2090
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,520
You think I'm a phony for despising my upbringing.

2091
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,900
What is your upbringing?

2092
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,100
But...

2093
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,920
But at least you had a real upbringing.

2094
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,020
It's me who had a fake one.

2095
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,720
Oh, my gosh.

2096
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,540
I'm gonna comfort.

2097
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,240
Gonzalo.

2098
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:19,920
Oh, my God.

2099
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:20,220
Yes.

2100
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:20,740
Yes.

2101
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:22,720
Yes.

2102
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:23,340
Yes.

2103
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:23,640
Look.

2104
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,600
Yes.

2105
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:25,300
We need to talk.

2106
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:26,900
Yeah.

2107
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,280
I'm here for you.

2108
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:29,640
Gonzalo.

2109
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,800
Thanks for coming over.

2110
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,240
You...

2111
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,020
I think you helped us.

2112
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:33,680
And no.

2113
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:34,980
Gonzalo.

2114
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:35,480
Yeah.

2115
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,980
You don't need to say anything more.

2116
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,440
More.

2117
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:40,760
Say...

2118
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,100
More.

2119
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,500
Anything more.

2120
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,940
Are they leaving?

2121
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,400
This is your house.

2122
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,280
Gonzalo.

2123
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:48,800
Yeah?

2124
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,220
Please.

2125
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:49,980
It's okay.

2126
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,440
Can I get another drink?

2127
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,600
I...

2128
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,300
I didn't eat today.

2129
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:01,840
Please.

2130
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,420
I...

2131
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,440
I thought...

2132
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,360
I thought we were having dinner...

2133
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,520
I'm taking the magic 8-ball.

2134
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,340
Will I starve tonight?

2135
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:20,960
Bye.

2136
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:21,640
No!

2137
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,520
Oh, thank god.

2138
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,880
Wait, what did she say?

2139
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:25,320
Oh!

2140
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,500
What just happened?

2141
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,300
Did I win?

2142
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,000
You moved in with them.

2143
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,440
She said, bye, thanks.

2144
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,320
Oh!

2145
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,560
Yippee!

2146
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:57,740
What?

2147
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:59,160
It's my house now?

2148
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:03,040
Oh my god, this is actually like what happens to me for real.

2149
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,060
I go and haunt someone and then sometimes they leave.

2150
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,620
And it becomes my house.

2151
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,360
That's really exciting.

2152
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,260
I didn't know that that...

2153
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,900
could happen in the game as well.

2154
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,320
Hold on, let's try another one.

2155
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,020
I think someone said, like, speak only...

2156
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,940
That one, we barely talked and it actually ended up working out.

2157
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,980
How is that possible?

2158
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,720
Maybe they really just needed to talk things out and we were just a good friend to listen.

2159
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:33,280
You know?

2160
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,100
You can... I want to actually...

2161
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,260
I do want to kind of romance someone.

2162
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:39,800
You know?

2163
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:41,880
Let's kind of...

2164
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,580
Let's kind of...

2165
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,480
Who should we romance?

2166
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,320
Tripp or Grace?

2167
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,520
Tripp is kind of crazy.

2168
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,520
Tripp is...

2169
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,360
I don't understand what his deal is.

2170
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,460
Why does he hate art so much?

2171
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,800
Why does he not want her to be a painter?

2172
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,240
Why can't she just do that?

2173
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,160
Like, as a hobby even.

2174
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,340
Grace?

2175
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:58,740
Okay.

2176
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,520
We're gonna romance Grace.

2177
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,140
Okay.

2178
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,400
Alright, here we go.

2179
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,000
She has to advertise.

2180
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,060
Why he is so, like...

2181
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,780
Oh my god, I'm gonna ask her if she painted that.

2182
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,460
Only MGS quotes, right?

2183
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,880
Okay, let's do that one and then we'll romance Grace.

2184
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:29,860
Okay.

2185
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,460
She's gonna really fall hard for Gonzalo.

2186
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,720
Alright, first we'll do the Metal Gear.

2187
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,160
And then...

2188
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,840
Where are the new wine glasses?

2189
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:44,940
What for?

2190
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:45,900
Oh my gosh, I do that every time.

2191
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:46,420
That should be obvious.

2192
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,320
Oh god, Tripp, don't turn this into a big production, please.

2193
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,080
Oh, he's here.

2194
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:52,480
I'm here.

2195
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,960
You said he's coming an hour from now.

2196
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,460
I'm here.

2197
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,580
Oh, he's supposed to be here now.

2198
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:57,240
I'm here.

2199
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,240
Gonzalo!

2200
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,000
Oh my god.

2201
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,640
God, it's been so long since I've seen you.

2202
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,220
Kept you waiting.

2203
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,500
How you doing, man?

2204
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,220
Wait, what titty?

2205
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,200
Waiting, huh?

2206
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:13,500
Well, come on in.

2207
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,360
Uh, what else should I say?

2208
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,420
Uh, it'll be just a sec while I go get Grace.

2209
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:20,000
Okay.

2210
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,300
Oh wait, um...

2211
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,390
No, no, here we are.

2212
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,010
Gonzalo?

2213
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:33,510
Yes?

2214
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,470
Hi, how are you?

2215
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,270
I am so happy to see you after so long.

2216
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:39,990
Yeah, how are you?

2217
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:41,990
Um...

2218
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:43,890
Well, come in.

2219
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:44,910
Make yourself at home.

2220
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,070
Oh, Gonzalo?

2221
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,750
That's so nice of you to say.

2222
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,570
By the way, you look fabulous.

2223
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:00,390
Hey, Gonzalo.

2224
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:01,090
Seeing you.

2225
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:03,390
Oh, I'll get it.

2226
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:04,430
No, no, we have a guest.

2227
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:06,370
We can let the answering machine pick it up.

2228
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:06,950
Grace?

2229
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:07,530
Why did she turn?

2230
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:08,270
It's so scary.

2231
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:08,550
Don't be rude.

2232
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:12,050
It's probably just the cleaning service cancelling on us again.

2233
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:12,570
Grace?

2234
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:12,970
Grace?

2235
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:13,310
Hello?

2236
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:13,910
No, please don't.

2237
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:14,630
Please don't do that.

2238
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:16,990
Who is this, Grace?

2239
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:17,570
Is that you?

2240
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:17,690
Is this for you?

2241
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:18,750
Oh, it's my dad.

2242
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:19,730
I can hear his voice.

2243
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,030
Here you go.

2244
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:20,330
Oh.

2245
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:21,850
Oh!

2246
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:22,890
Excuse me.

2247
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:23,190
I must have the wrong number.

2248
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,770
Okay, he's being annoying as usual.

2249
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:26,110
Just, just hang it up.

2250
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:26,730
She didn't care.

2251
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,070
Oh, good.

2252
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:30,770
You hung up.

2253
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:31,970
I can call him back later.

2254
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,030
Or, you know, she did.

2255
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:33,630
She didn't notice.

2256
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,830
She didn't notice.

2257
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:35,970
Wait.

2258
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:36,370
Uh...

2259
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:36,630
Oh.

2260
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,410
You, uh...

2261
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,630
Wait, I think they just noticed.

2262
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,070
Oh, well.

2263
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:42,490
Uh, sorry.

2264
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:42,750
Sorry.

2265
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:47,070
Gonzalo.

2266
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:48,530
You maniac.

2267
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:50,590
You sex maniac.

2268
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,690
Never afraid to mess with us.

2269
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,730
You're a beautiful couple.

2270
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:56,290
You're crazy.

2271
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,510
You know that.

2272
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,390
I'm crazy.

2273
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:04,010
Anyway, what were we talking about?

2274
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:04,970
Hey.

2275
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,490
Gonzalo.

2276
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:06,990
Yeah.

2277
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,590
Seeing you again makes me remember the good times we all used to have.

2278
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:09,970
Oh, yeah.

2279
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:10,570
Yes.

2280
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:11,430
Those crazy parties.

2281
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,470
Those crazy parties.

2282
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:14,810
Yeah.

2283
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:16,650
I've, um...

2284
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,570
I've missed you.

2285
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:18,150
Hey.

2286
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:18,910
I've missed you, too.

2287
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:19,830
I just realized something.

2288
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:20,230
What?

2289
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,790
Oh.

2290
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:22,210
Yeah.

2291
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:23,090
Gonzalo.

2292
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:23,470
Yeah.

2293
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:23,870
Careful.

2294
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,110
Too many compliments can go to Tripp's head.

2295
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:27,250
I...

2296
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:27,870
I...

2297
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:28,310
I'll...

2298
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,890
I'll compliment you, too, Grace.

2299
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:31,250
So, yeah.

2300
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,510
Uh, well.

2301
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:34,690
Remember how you...

2302
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:34,850
Sorry.

2303
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,290
I gave up the Metal Gear Quote thing.

2304
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:39,210
I couldn't think of anything to say.

2305
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:40,290
Wait.

2306
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:40,670
What did he say?

2307
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:42,470
Uh...

2308
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:43,330
What did he ask?

2309
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:43,810
Um...

2310
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:46,830
Well, without you, we wouldn't even have this celebration.

2311
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:47,630
Huh.

2312
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,050
You two really are getting along well tonight.

2313
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:51,510
So...

2314
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,050
Yeah.

2315
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:52,670
Gonzalo.

2316
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:53,230
Like...

2317
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:56,010
You can help me understand where I went wrong with my new decorating.

2318
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:56,650
We could kiss.

2319
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:57,150
Oh.

2320
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:57,570
Grace.

2321
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,490
I'm gonna ask her.

2322
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,610
Okay, here.

2323
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,410
We don't need to do that.

2324
01:11:59,610 --> 01:11:59,810
Oh.

2325
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:00,910
I'm back on the couch.

2326
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,230
You know, I've been collecting these little glass sculptures...

2327
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:05,250
Did you paint this?

2328
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:05,710
Yeah.

2329
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:05,990
The...

2330
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:10,690
Well, it's funny how after a full day's work designing magazine ads, Grace finds the time to decorate.

2331
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:11,330
And...

2332
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,130
Redecorate.

2333
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,370
I guess it's just the artist in me dying to get out.

2334
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:15,610
Oh.

2335
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:15,910
Wait.

2336
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:17,850
So, yeah.

2337
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,230
I just bought this painting.

2338
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:20,270
But, God.

2339
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,050
You know, it looks like an amateur painted it.

2340
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:22,670
You...

2341
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:22,850
You painted it.

2342
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:24,450
Ugh.

2343
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,430
Well, it looks so amateurish.

2344
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:27,230
Doesn't it?

2345
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:27,570
No.

2346
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,410
It's awesome.

2347
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:29,650
Oh.

2348
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,370
How nice.

2349
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:33,130
I've been waiting so long for someone to say that.

2350
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:33,310
Grace.

2351
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:33,810
I'm gonna hug her.

2352
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:34,070
Wait.

2353
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,270
What?

2354
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:36,770
Tripp, our friend has just been refreshingly on...

2355
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:37,150
Oh.

2356
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:38,770
You're hugging me.

2357
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:39,110
No.

2358
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,770
I'm comforting you.

2359
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:40,870
Oh.

2360
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:41,670
That's...

2361
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,070
Oh.

2362
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,750
That's...

2363
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,270
Nice, Grace.

2364
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:45,590
I think a hug was just what you needed.

2365
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:47,270
Can you give us a...

2366
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:48,310
A second?

2367
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:49,510
Tripp?

2368
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:51,870
All right.

2369
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:52,590
Good.

2370
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:55,270
Maybe you're on my side tonight after all.

2371
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:55,830
Can you...

2372
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:56,370
Can you...

2373
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,290
Can you give us a moment, Tripp?

2374
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,850
Why does he always look like...

2375
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,170
You're not enjoying this, are you?

2376
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:03,410
What?

2377
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:04,930
Why do they always look like they're...

2378
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,970
Tripp, have you noticed we're fighting in front of our friend?

2379
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:07,850
Like, heads are backwards.

2380
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:08,270
You know?

2381
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:08,550
Come on.

2382
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,090
That kind of...

2383
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,390
That kind of statement is not helpful.

2384
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,090
Tripp, there's nothing wrong with...

2385
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:12,430
This is me.

2386
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:13,590
I'm having so much fun.

2387
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:14,410
What?

2388
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:15,590
What do you mean?

2389
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,770
Gonzalo?

2390
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:16,290
Yeah?

2391
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,930
I want you to look at this photo from our recent trip to Italy.

2392
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:19,190
No.

2393
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:21,310
Oh, no, no.

2394
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:22,910
Go look at Tripp's Italy photo.

2395
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:24,130
So, come on.

2396
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:26,170
I'd rather be with you, Grace.

2397
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,510
I want you to look at this.

2398
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,330
Go take a look.

2399
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:31,390
Gonzalo.

2400
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,030
Come on.

2401
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,130
Just take a look at this picture.

2402
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:33,430
No.

2403
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,650
This is your idea of an enjoyable evening with friends.

2404
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:37,730
Stop pressuring me.

2405
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:38,110
No.

2406
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:38,310
No.

2407
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:39,070
Come on.

2408
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:39,410
Come take a look.

2409
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:39,590
No.

2410
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:41,510
Tripp, you see?

2411
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:45,310
Your fetish for all things European is making our friend very uncomfortable.

2412
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:46,150
I'm uncomfortable.

2413
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:47,190
Damn it, Grace.

2414
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,910
This was supposed to be our second honeymoon.

2415
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:49,670
What?

2416
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:51,050
Gonzalo.

2417
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,550
Tripp is absolutely exaggerating.

2418
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,210
Look at this photograph.

2419
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:54,750
Wait.

2420
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,210
See?

2421
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,070
I just wanted us to spend some time together.

2422
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,830
All those business trips of yours to Europe must have done something to you.

2423
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:01,730
Ugh.

2424
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,890
You're driving me insane.

2425
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:04,610
You're driving me crazy.

2426
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,110
You're tearing me apart.

2427
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:06,790
Goddamn, Italy.

2428
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:07,370
I tried to reach out to you.

2429
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:08,530
How am I supposed to raise them?

2430
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,290
I try to be romantic with you, but you're cold and distant.

2431
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,870
I do.

2432
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,110
I really try.

2433
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:14,790
Stop yelling at me.

2434
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,270
Why?

2435
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:17,230
Gonzalo.

2436
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:17,790
Yes?

2437
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:18,590
I...

2438
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:19,770
Yeah.

2439
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:21,550
Gonzalo.

2440
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,170
Yeah.

2441
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,710
I know what you're about to say.

2442
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:24,150
How I...

2443
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,950
With your damn kissing and flirting Christ.

2444
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:30,870
Grace.

2445
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,150
Goddamn second honeymoon.

2446
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,410
Tripp, our whole marriage, you're so...

2447
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:36,930
Huh?

2448
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:37,430
What?

2449
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:38,410
What was that?

2450
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:39,190
I didn't do anything.

2451
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,090
Goddamn manipulation.

2452
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:41,250
I didn't do anything.

2453
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:41,550
Grace.

2454
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,710
I just want to be together and be happy.

2455
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:44,430
I'm comforting.

2456
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,090
Can you just see that?

2457
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,670
I'm comforting.

2458
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:46,650
Can't we just do that?

2459
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:47,270
I'm comforting.

2460
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:49,890
I'm comforting.

2461
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:50,650
All right.

2462
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:51,390
You know what?

2463
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:52,570
Gonzalo.

2464
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:53,130
Yeah.

2465
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,570
I'm going to ask you something.

2466
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:55,270
Tripp.

2467
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,610
Grace.

2468
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:56,410
I'm in love with your wife.

2469
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:57,950
Can we ask our guest a question?

2470
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:00,490
Comforting.

2471
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:00,930
I'm comforting.

2472
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:01,090
Gonzalo.

2473
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:01,510
I'm comforting.

2474
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:01,910
Yes or no?

2475
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:08,150
It's okay for a married person to talk and be friendly with someone of the opposite sex.

2476
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:08,630
Right?

2477
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:10,130
Oh.

2478
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:10,590
What?

2479
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:11,030
Um.

2480
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:12,590
I mean, come on.

2481
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:16,690
If you're married, a little bit of harmless flirting and joking around is allowed.

2482
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:17,550
Am I right?

2483
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:18,230
Yes or no?

2484
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:18,790
What?

2485
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:21,670
Oh.

2486
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:22,570
Okay.

2487
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:23,710
Fine.

2488
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:25,530
Wait.

2489
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:25,950
Is this...

2490
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:29,330
The real truth is, Tripp, you flirt with everybody.

2491
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,770
The clients at work.

2492
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:31,370
Our friends.

2493
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:31,890
Everybody.

2494
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:33,030
You can't help yourself.

2495
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,530
You're always looking around.

2496
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:35,990
Our entire marriage.

2497
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:37,030
Goddamn it.

2498
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:37,290
Oh.

2499
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:37,950
Oh.

2500
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:38,050
Oh.

2501
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:38,130
Oh.

2502
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:38,910
Yeah.

2503
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,730
Go on.

2504
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:40,410
Go away.

2505
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,890
I can't freaking take this.

2506
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,410
Are you okay?

2507
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:43,950
Are you okay, Grace?

2508
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:44,410
What the?

2509
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:45,510
Goddamn it.

2510
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:47,010
Are you okay, Grace?

2511
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,390
Comfort.

2512
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,490
Uh.

2513
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:51,610
Comfort.

2514
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:52,270
Gonzalo.

2515
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:52,890
Comfort.

2516
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:53,190
What?

2517
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:54,830
I can't hear you.

2518
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,290
Are you talking?

2519
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:55,590
I was not talking.

2520
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:56,390
Gonzalo.

2521
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:56,850
Oh.

2522
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,750
Gonzalo.

2523
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,250
Yeah.

2524
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,850
In what you said before about flirting.

2525
01:15:59,850 --> 01:15:59,970
Yeah.

2526
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:00,210
Yeah.

2527
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:01,490
Where'd you go?

2528
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:02,930
I think that shows us something about Tripp.

2529
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:03,430
Where'd you go?

2530
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,530
Gonzalo.

2531
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:04,110
Where'd you go?

2532
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:05,150
We're talking about me, are we?

2533
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:05,750
What?

2534
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,050
Damn it, Tripp.

2535
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:11,250
You and my parents are always planning these stupid trips I have to go on.

2536
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,390
They're vacations.

2537
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:14,270
Expensive ones at that.

2538
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,970
What's wrong with vacations?

2539
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,010
Of course, nobody thinks to ask me what I want.

2540
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:17,610
What do you...

2541
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:19,270
What do you want, Grace?

2542
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:19,830
Oh.

2543
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:20,330
She looked at me.

2544
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:20,650
What?

2545
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:21,650
She wants me to ask.

2546
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:22,470
You want to know more?

2547
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:23,170
Thank you.

2548
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:23,530
That helps.

2549
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,270
Grace, you never want to go on vacation with me and your parents.

2550
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,510
So I have to plan everything.

2551
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,110
Ugh.

2552
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,370
She doesn't want to go on vacation.

2553
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,470
Let's talk some more about Grace.

2554
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:32,390
Yeah.

2555
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,190
Comfort.

2556
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:34,630
Yes.

2557
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:34,870
Thanks.

2558
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:39,610
But what we need right now is to just get all this out in the open.

2559
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:40,250
I'm hugging.

2560
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:40,690
Jesus.

2561
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:41,050
I'm hugging.

2562
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:42,310
Jesus.

2563
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:43,890
Gonzalo...

2564
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:44,190
Yes!

2565
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,070
Quit it with that stuff.

2566
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:45,410
Oh.

2567
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:53,080
Look, why don't we talk about us?

2568
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,040
Jesus, Gonzalo, quit it with that stuff.

2569
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,480
I'm doing what you won't.

2570
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,940
Let's talk some more about Grace.

2571
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,260
Tripp, you're the reason we live.

2572
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh, we're back at this one.

2573
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,760
Okay.

2574
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,360
And so...

2575
01:17:54,740 --> 01:18:00,220
Your triangles are so... personal.

2576
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,820
I... it's... it's... um... wonderful.

2577
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,340
Triangles.

2578
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,920
It's not stupid.

2579
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,580
It's not stupid!

2580
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,480
Oh my God.

2581
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:18,900
So triangular.

2582
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,120
Bing bing bing bing bing.

2583
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,320
Bing bing bing bing.

2584
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,720
Bing bing bing bing.

2585
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,440
Gonzalo.

2586
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,580
Why do you say my name!

2587
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,080
You... you're an artist.

2588
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:36,060
Uh, Gonzalo, you know we already talked about that.

2589
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,940
Okay, um...

2590
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,320
Paint.

2591
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,300
Comfort.

2592
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:48,140
Comfort.

2593
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,060
No!

2594
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:52,640
Gonzalo.

2595
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:53,860
Gonzalo.

2596
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,200
What?

2597
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:58,840
I'm gonna...

2598
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,900
Can I kiss her?

2599
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:00,720
I can kiss her.

2600
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,480
You think if I try to, she'll get mad?

2601
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,520
No.

2602
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,200
What?

2603
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:10,920
No!

2604
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,320
Why do you mean...

2605
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,680
No!

2606
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:17,580
Wait!

2607
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:18,100
What?

2608
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,720
The game is... the game is... what?

2609
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,940
The game is... what?

2610
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:38,340
Hello?

2611
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,280
You think I'm lying?

2612
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,120
Yes.

2613
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:42,980
Yes?

2614
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:43,820
Yes.

2615
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:44,880
Yeah.

2616
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,600
Look how sad he looks.

2617
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,200
Oh, he's crying!

2618
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,500
Oh, you...

2619
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,460
Does anyone...

2620
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,060
He looks so sad.

2621
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,980
We should... we should talk about Tripp.

2622
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,980
See, Grace?

2623
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,960
He's crying.

2624
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,800
He's crying and you want to talk...

2625
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,540
I'm turning this into such a big issue.

2626
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,920
I still say advertising is the best thing for you.

2627
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,760
Best for me or for you?

2628
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:13,260
What?

2629
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:14,920
Gonzalo.

2630
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:16,480
Yes?

2631
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,300
I think you should paint.

2632
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,420
Okay.

2633
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,280
I'm sick of this bullshit.

2634
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,280
What is this over here?

2635
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:28,640
Gonzalo.

2636
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,020
I know what you're hinting at.

2637
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:30,300
Okay?

2638
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:30,880
What?

2639
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:31,640
About me?

2640
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,280
Yeah.

2641
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,160
About art?

2642
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:33,460
What are these?

2643
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,860
Do you two want the truth?

2644
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:36,280
Huh?

2645
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:36,940
What is this over here?

2646
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:37,660
Yeah?

2647
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,160
Gonzalo.

2648
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,300
Do you want to hear it?

2649
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,000
No.

2650
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,960
I don't care what you have to say.

2651
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:43,280
Grace?

2652
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:43,740
Yes?

2653
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:47,340
See?

2654
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:48,680
Gonzalo.

2655
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,200
I've been paying attention to what you've been saying tonight.

2656
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:51,700
Yeah?

2657
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:52,900
What?

2658
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:53,980
You've been pushing me tonight.

2659
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:54,380
Oh.

2660
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,160
I'm pushing you on me.

2661
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,720
And I wonder, are you really my friend?

2662
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,520
Or not?

2663
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,160
Tripp?

2664
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,560
No.

2665
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:00,300
Gonzalo.

2666
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:00,660
Gonzalo.

2667
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,420
Quit interrupting me.

2668
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:01,940
Let me finish.

2669
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:02,460
No.

2670
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:02,880
Gonzalo.

2671
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,180
I asked you this.

2672
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:04,340
No.

2673
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,240
Yes or no?

2674
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:05,740
Oh?

2675
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:09,840
Do you really think that praising me, asking if we're okay...

2676
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:10,040
I'm...

2677
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:10,600
I'm praising you?

2678
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,060
Kissing Grace?

2679
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:14,280
But especially what you said about harmless flirting.

2680
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:17,080
And you don't even say yes when I ask you if you want the truth?

2681
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:17,780
Okay.

2682
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,900
That I'm supposed to realize something about myself from all that.

2683
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,980
Is what you've said tonight supposed to add up somehow to something?

2684
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:25,380
Maybe.

2685
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:25,640
Is it?

2686
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,860
I just want a yes or no.

2687
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:27,160
Oh.

2688
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:27,860
Okay.

2689
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:28,340
Yes.

2690
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:29,520
Okay.

2691
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:31,960
Okay.

2692
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,120
Grace?

2693
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:35,720
Yes?

2694
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,980
I know you want to be an artist.

2695
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,720
But I could never be married to you if you were.

2696
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,540
I'm gonna kiss her.

2697
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,200
What?

2698
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,780
I can't.

2699
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,580
I just can't.

2700
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,220
But Tripp...

2701
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:52,000
When I married you, see, I was sure I could convince you to give it up.

2702
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:52,800
I don't think she cares.

2703
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,240
And advertising.

2704
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,160
Oh.

2705
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,520
And I did it.

2706
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,260
And it worked.

2707
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,540
European kiss.

2708
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:58,940
But no.

2709
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,880
I don't know, Grace.

2710
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:04,540
European.

2711
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,300
I don't know.

2712
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:05,700
I don't know.

2713
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:11,640
Grace?

2714
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,820
Oh my God.

2715
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:14,480
Oh.

2716
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:14,800
Gonzalo.

2717
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,480
I...

2718
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,400
Gonzalo.

2719
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,200
I...

2720
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:17,720
Gonzalo.

2721
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,500
Gonzalo.

2722
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:18,660
What?

2723
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,420
Gonzalo.

2724
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,420
This changes everything.

2725
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:20,760
I...

2726
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,440
Gonzalo.

2727
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:21,700
U.

2728
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:22,760
Gonzalo.

2729
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:22,960
I.

2730
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:23,320
E.

2731
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:23,340
U.

2732
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:23,720
Yes.

2733
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,880
It does change everything.

2734
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:26,600
No.

2735
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:27,840
Gonzalo.

2736
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:28,520
Gonzalo.

2737
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:28,960
Hold on.

2738
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:29,420
Yes?

2739
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,640
Where is he going?

2740
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,700
He's stomping over there.

2741
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,920
I think it's over.

2742
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:36,440
Okay.

2743
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:37,580
Tripp?

2744
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:37,920
What?

2745
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:38,280
No.

2746
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:41,940
It's over, Grace.

2747
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,180
Don't you see that?

2748
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,540
She doesn't see anything.

2749
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,440
She's only looking at me.

2750
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,000
You just told me...

2751
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,700
I just told you something about me I should have said a long time ago.

2752
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:50,880
What's that?

2753
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,500
I can't be married to an artist.

2754
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,720
This guy sucks so much.

2755
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,900
What do you have against art?

2756
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,280
Gonzalo.

2757
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:57,580
Please.

2758
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,340
It's okay.

2759
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,200
Tripp.

2760
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:00,600
No.

2761
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:01,460
I...

2762
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,260
No, Grace.

2763
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,680
This is about...

2764
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:03,980
It's about me.

2765
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,220
I see now.

2766
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,880
It's not about you or about our marriage.

2767
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,100
Me?

2768
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:10,660
Our marriage?

2769
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,080
Where did he go?

2770
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:11,760
Hey, no.

2771
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,360
Wait.

2772
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,440
Gonzalo.

2773
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:14,160
I'm sorry.

2774
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,420
Thank you, though.

2775
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,520
You really helped me.

2776
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,380
He's actually leaving.

2777
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:18,940
Oh, get...

2778
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:19,100
Tripp.

2779
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,040
Get out of here, Tripp.

2780
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:21,620
Tripp.

2781
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:21,940
It's our house.

2782
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,060
Tripp.

2783
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:22,960
It's our house now.

2784
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,840
Oh, my God.

2785
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,800
I should have told him that...

2786
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,340
That I wanted to be an artist.

2787
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:33,180
I should have told him that...

2788
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:33,280
That I wanted to be an artist.

2789
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:33,460
I should have told him that...

2790
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,620
Oh, my gosh.

2791
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,340
Free wife with the house.

2792
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:37,920
Let's go.

2793
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,340
This might actually be a better ending for them.

2794
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,640
We're free wife with the house.

2795
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:44,760
Yippee.

2796
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:48,180
What?

2797
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:48,640
What?

2798
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:49,500
The what?

2799
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,100
What?

2800
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:50,400
What?

2801
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,120
I really want an ending where, like, she kind of falls for me, though.

2802
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,140
Hmm.

2803
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,000
I wonder if that even exists.

2804
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,200
It's our wife now.

2805
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:02,920
Oh, my God.

2806
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:02,960
Oh, my God.

2807
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:03,860
Well...

2808
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,140
This game is crazy.

2809
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,560
Need more Riz.

2810
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:11,880
All right.

2811
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,220
This time...

2812
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:14,540
You.

2813
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:19,920
You guys are telling me what to type.

2814
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:20,620
Okay?

2815
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,180
And I'll type it at any moment.

2816
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:29,100
It might be hard because some of the stuff is kind of quickly timed.

2817
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:29,860
Okay?

2818
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,080
But you guys have to tell me what to type.

2819
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:33,440
Say what you have to say and I'll do it.

2820
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:33,620
Okay.

2821
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:39,810
Wah!

2822
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:41,070
Thank you, Ms. Miss!

2823
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,950
Don't tell me what I can't do.

2824
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,510
Thank you so much!

2825
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:47,490
Thank you!

2826
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:49,150
Alright.

2827
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:50,730
Alright.

2828
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,690
Just say yes to everything.

2829
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:56,650
Melon speedrun.

2830
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:58,470
See ya, Tripp.

2831
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:02,130
Alright.

2832
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,650
We could come out of this with a new wife.

2833
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:06,470
I'm just saying.

2834
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,110
If you play your cards right.

2835
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:10,070
Answer everything with Bazinga.

2836
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:15,530
Stop!

2837
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:16,810
I already said Melon!

2838
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:24,170
I already said Melon.

2839
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:27,650
Subtitles.

2840
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,150
Oh!

2841
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:29,150
Ah!

2842
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:29,530
Ah!

2843
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:29,930
Ah!

2844
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:30,670
There we go.

2845
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:30,970
Okay.

2846
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:33,110
Alright.

2847
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:34,090
First of all...

2848
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:36,570
Do we knock on the door or do we just stand out here?

2849
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:40,510
And what do we say when he greets us?

2850
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:44,170
Lemon.

2851
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:47,450
Okay.

2852
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:50,250
I'm saying mostly just stand.

2853
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:51,310
So we're just gonna stand.

2854
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:58,270
Can I leave actually?

2855
01:25:58,830 --> 01:25:59,430
Gonzalo!

2856
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,060
Gonzalo!

2857
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:14,620
Ding!

2858
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:23,750
Oh no!

2859
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:25,150
He had to sit through the...

2860
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:25,950
I'm so sorry.

2861
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:27,950
I'm so sorry.

2862
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:29,290
We have to sit through it again.

2863
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:30,730
Okay.

2864
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:35,730
I think I will make this the last run though.

2865
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:36,890
Actually.

2866
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:39,170
I will make this probably the last one.

2867
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,470
What?

2868
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:44,870
I just...

2869
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:46,670
I just... I knew what was coming.

2870
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,870
I heard them arguing and I was like, I'm not dealing with your...

2871
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:51,470
I'm not dealing with your...

2872
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:52,370
With your...

2873
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:53,750
With this tonight.

2874
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:54,850
I cannot deal.

2875
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,410
I cannot deal with it.

2876
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:59,010
I do not have the...

2877
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:01,950
The patience, the mental capacity.

2878
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:08,450
Failed marriage.

2879
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:11,470
If I never go in there, what do you think happens I wonder?

2880
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,210
Welcome to membership.

2881
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:20,890
Thank you.

2882
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:27,110
Not dealing with your BS.

2883
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,290
So true.

2884
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:34,530
Okay.

2885
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,010
Final Gonzalo.

2886
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:40,190
Here we go.

2887
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:43,610
Okay.

2888
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:44,510
I'm going to stand here.

2889
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:46,770
Standing here.

2890
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:51,130
I realize this is a waste of time.

2891
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:53,090
Okay.

2892
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,150
You know, I've had to ask you about this several...

2893
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:58,170
I'll get rid of it in just a minute.

2894
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:00,110
Fine, Tripp.

2895
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:00,630
Fine.

2896
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,410
Wait, what is she not like?

2897
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:05,010
Um, I'm here.

2898
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:08,430
Gonzalo.

2899
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:09,210
Hey.

2900
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,210
I thought I heard someone out here.

2901
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:12,070
Great to see you.

2902
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:12,810
It's been a while.

2903
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,350
How's it going?

2904
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,270
What should I say?

2905
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:17,070
Oh, hi, Mark.

2906
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:18,430
Hi.

2907
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:19,130
Wow.

2908
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:21,090
It's really, really great to see you.

2909
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:21,890
Come on in.

2910
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,750
Your name's Mark now.

2911
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:24,810
Got it?

2912
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:25,510
Uh...

2913
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,130
Yeah.

2914
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:28,090
It'll be just a sec while I go get Grace.

2915
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:28,810
Grace?

2916
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:30,310
What is this?

2917
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:30,830
No, no.

2918
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:31,570
Here we are.

2919
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:32,090
Oh.

2920
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:32,390
Hello.

2921
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:34,250
Gonzalo?

2922
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:35,170
Hi.

2923
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:35,790
Gonzalo.

2924
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:36,430
How are you?

2925
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:36,970
Oh, God.

2926
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:38,510
It's been such a long time.

2927
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:39,490
Merry Christmas.

2928
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:39,630
That's funny.

2929
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:40,450
I said the same thing.

2930
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:40,970
Skibbity.

2931
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:41,770
Skibbity.

2932
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:42,670
Skibbity.

2933
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:44,590
By the way, you look wonderful.

2934
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:46,570
Um...

2935
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:48,690
Well, come in.

2936
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:49,670
Make yourself at home.

2937
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:52,430
Out.

2938
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:53,210
Close the door.

2939
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:54,210
Gonzalo?

2940
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,790
Seeing you again makes me remember the wonderful...

2941
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:57,770
What?

2942
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,350
Oh.

2943
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:58,970
I'll get it.

2944
01:28:59,110 --> 01:28:59,170
No.

2945
01:28:59,190 --> 01:28:59,470
No.

2946
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:00,050
We have a guest.

2947
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:02,030
We can let the answering machine pick it up.

2948
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:02,470
Grace?

2949
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:02,910
No.

2950
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,250
I work...

2951
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,190
Don't be rude.

2952
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:05,330
I'll get it.

2953
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:06,870
It's probably just the execs at work.

2954
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:07,610
Gonzalo?

2955
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:07,790
Grace?

2956
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:08,030
Hello?

2957
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:08,330
No.

2958
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:09,350
Please don't do that.

2959
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:10,270
I did it.

2960
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:11,470
Who is this?

2961
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:11,770
Grace?

2962
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:12,510
Is that you?

2963
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:12,810
Ugh.

2964
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:13,470
It's my dad.

2965
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:14,510
I can hear his voice.

2966
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:15,030
Oh.

2967
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:25,290
Well...

2968
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,190
Oh.

2969
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,270
That's nice of you to say.

2970
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,810
Grace, aren't you glad we invited him over?

2971
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:30,250
Yeah.

2972
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:31,870
Ahem.

2973
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:33,110
Ahem.

2974
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:33,290
Ahem.

2975
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:35,230
Well, Grace's parents...

2976
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:36,170
Is it really her dad?

2977
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:36,550
They're something else.

2978
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,970
Really classy people.

2979
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,110
Ugh.

2980
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:38,210
No.

2981
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:38,990
They're impossible.

2982
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,910
They expect me to drive up to the house in Connecticut...

2983
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:45,510
...to attend all their stupid socialite charity benefits and parties.

2984
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:46,790
It's so tiresome.

2985
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,070
Sigh.

2986
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:48,010
I...

2987
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:49,710
Silence.

2988
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:53,110
Well, it didn't take long for you two to bond or whatever.

2989
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:53,270
What?

2990
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:53,750
We bonded?

2991
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:54,110
So...

2992
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:54,190
What?

2993
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:55,510
Gonzalo.

2994
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:56,990
You can help me understand...

2995
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:57,370
Your eyes?

2996
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,930
...what went wrong with my new decorating.

2997
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:00,410
Grace.

2998
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:00,890
Oh.

2999
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:04,830
Gonzalo.

3000
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:07,910
I think you're flirting with me to get on my good side.

3001
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:08,990
Oh!

3002
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:09,730
Oh!

3003
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:10,770
Oh!

3004
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:11,670
Grace.

3005
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:12,390
No, no, no.

3006
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:13,090
He's just joking.

3007
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:13,370
Oh!

3008
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:14,510
What?

3009
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,010
That worked!

3010
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:16,470
The Riz!

3011
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:18,030
Do you like country life?

3012
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:18,610
So, about my decorating?

3013
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:24,170
When I saw this armoire in the store, it seemed to have such a clean, simple look to it.

3014
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:24,890
Yeah.

3015
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:25,890
It looks great.

3016
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:26,670
How did that work?

3017
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,110
But looking at it here in the apartment, it just looks like a...

3018
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:30,790
Go...

3019
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:31,410
How...

3020
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:31,690
What else?

3021
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:32,130
...monstrosity.

3022
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:32,850
Come on, guys.

3023
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:33,090
Come on, guys.

3024
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:33,550
Oh, Grace.

3025
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,030
Your dad sounds hot.

3026
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:36,930
Your dad sounds hot.

3027
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:40,090
No, no.

3028
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:40,650
You've...

3029
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:43,090
You've done quite enough with my parents tonight.

3030
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:44,410
Let's not talk about them anymore.

3031
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:45,190
Okay.

3032
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:46,030
Sorry.

3033
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:48,990
Grace, it seems no one has a problem with your decorating.

3034
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:49,030
Guys.

3035
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:49,250
Elriz.

3036
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:49,690
Elriz.

3037
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:51,210
Tripp, that's what you always say.

3038
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:52,270
Grab the rainbow sculpture.

3039
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:52,810
But believe me.

3040
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:53,850
It needs to be redone.

3041
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:56,410
Ugh.

3042
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:58,170
Let's not talk about that anymore.

3043
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:59,770
I'm redoing the whole place anyway.

3044
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:00,630
What is this one anyway?

3045
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:01,950
Hey.

3046
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:02,730
Grace?

3047
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:03,470
Gonzalo.

3048
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:05,710
Seeing you brings back good memories, you know?

3049
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:06,130
Yes.

3050
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:07,450
Grace?

3051
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:08,390
What is this?

3052
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:10,430
Whoa.

3053
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:11,790
I just realized something.

3054
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:12,370
What?

3055
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:14,810
Oh, tonight's a special night.

3056
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:16,530
A celebration, in fact.

3057
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:17,290
It is?

3058
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:18,630
Celebration.

3059
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:18,770
Gonzalo.

3060
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:18,870
Remember?

3061
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:22,330
It was almost exactly ten years ago tonight that you introduced us.

3062
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:22,790
What?

3063
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:23,890
Senior year of college.

3064
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,110
Oh, jeez.

3065
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:26,190
Remember that?

3066
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:27,030
Sussy.

3067
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:32,930
Well, without you, we wouldn't even have this celebration.

3068
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,810
I'm just reading.

3069
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:39,510
I'm just putting in what you guys write.

3070
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:39,730
Gonzalo.

3071
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:41,750
You probably didn't come here to hear this.

3072
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:45,230
Wait, wait.

3073
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,250
What's wrong, Tripp?

3074
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:48,830
Tripp, it's okay if we disagree in front of our friend.

3075
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:49,090
Why?

3076
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:50,070
We're not disagreeing.

3077
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:52,790
We're not disagreeing.

3078
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:54,730
Who is this?

3079
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,130
Oh, who is this?

3080
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:58,650
I thought you might like this photo I just put up from our recent trip to Italy.

3081
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:00,730
It's a beautiful picture of the Italian countryside.

3082
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:02,150
Of course he'll like it.

3083
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:02,690
Grace?

3084
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,650
Of course he'll like it.

3085
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:05,110
I don't know if you don't like it, but our friend might.

3086
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:06,070
Gonzalo?

3087
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:06,710
I'm looking.

3088
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:09,550
By the way, anybody, join me on the couch if you like.

3089
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:10,570
Um...

3090
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:11,230
Okay.

3091
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:11,750
Now...

3092
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,710
Gonzalo?

3093
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:13,130
Yeah?

3094
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:15,830
In one word, what does this picture say to you?

3095
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,370
Don't care.

3096
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:17,810
It'll...

3097
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:21,630
Well, actually, this trip to Italy was meant to be our second honeymoon.

3098
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:21,950
Wow.

3099
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:22,770
So...

3100
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:24,710
Oh, was that what it was?

3101
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:25,150
Huh.

3102
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:27,310
I'm always the last to know.

3103
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:27,730
Grace?

3104
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:28,450
Why is it like...

3105
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:30,350
Also, we have music this time and everything.

3106
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:32,510
It's interesting.

3107
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:33,090
So...

3108
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,430
In a word, this says...

3109
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:38,570
Grace stayed behind in the hotel room when I was out taking this picture.

3110
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:38,910
Oh.

3111
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:40,030
Romance.

3112
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:42,310
Right.

3113
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:43,310
Love.

3114
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:44,250
Romance.

3115
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:46,650
Oh, but the last time I said love, you kicked me out.

3116
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:47,850
In our marriage, that's just a code word for manipulation.

3117
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:51,810
Grace, it's been such a long time since we had a chance to be friends back then.

3118
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:51,930
I'm sorry.

3119
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:52,770
I was curious about that.

3120
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:54,210
That's what he would say if I agreed with him.

3121
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:55,590
... without even asking me if I wanted to go.

3122
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:57,670
I was curious what he'd say.

3123
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:00,270
Gonzalo, that's not the first time he's done that.

3124
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:00,750
Oh.

3125
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:03,830
And you knew I planned to attend my friend's art show that weekend.

3126
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:04,610
What?

3127
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:05,190
What?

3128
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:05,510
That's new.

3129
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:10,210
A very good friend from college had a gallery show of his new paintings that weekend, and I missed it.

3130
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:10,470
To be saved with joy.

3131
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:11,950
Thank you for the gift of...

3132
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:12,070
Ugh.

3133
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,170
This is bullshit.

3134
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:14,230
No.

3135
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:15,670
You're full of shit.

3136
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:18,390
Goddamn romance.

3137
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,170
I need to shit.

3138
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:21,910
What?

3139
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:22,410
I...

3140
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:22,770
What?

3141
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:23,870
What are you saying to me?

3142
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:27,550
Well, you just said... you know...

3143
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:28,090
Gonzalo, I...

3144
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:30,110
You said that you're full and I'm...

3145
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:30,250
Oh.

3146
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:31,150
And you...

3147
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:31,310
Oh.

3148
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,470
I know what you're going to say.

3149
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,510
You've been critical of me all evening.

3150
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:34,970
I have?

3151
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:36,170
I said...

3152
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:36,810
I compliment...

3153
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:37,990
I flirted with you.

3154
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:40,650
Your goddamn parents.

3155
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:41,450
I...

3156
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:42,530
You think you're better than me just because I don't come for...

3157
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:43,290
I flirted with you.

3158
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:43,730
Oh, sure.

3159
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:45,490
What?

3160
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:46,970
What are you saying to me?

3161
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:47,590
Oh.

3162
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:48,990
Babycore, thanks for the gift, then.

3163
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:49,750
All right.

3164
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:50,550
You know what?

3165
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:51,710
Gonzalo...

3166
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,550
Start speaking, Kevin.

3167
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:52,770
I'm going to...

3168
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:53,570
I need to ask you something.

3169
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:54,290
Grace...

3170
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:54,410
Oh.

3171
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:56,810
Tripp, let me ask our guest a question.

3172
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,370
Stop sabotaging us.

3173
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:00,330
Gonzalo...

3174
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,290
Yes or no?

3175
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:02,150
Okay.

3176
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:08,450
Do you think it's wrong for one person in a marriage to listen too much to the other?

3177
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:10,550
What?

3178
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:14,050
To trust your husband or wife too much.

3179
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,810
To rely on them too much.

3180
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:17,010
Is that wrong?

3181
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,190
Yes or no?

3182
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:18,690
Okay.

3183
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:19,710
You guys are saying yes.

3184
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:20,310
Yes.

3185
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:21,730
What?

3186
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,650
You guys said yes.

3187
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:24,890
Oh.

3188
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:25,950
All right.

3189
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,790
Yeah.

3190
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:32,690
I keep trying to help you, Grace, but you reject me.

3191
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,150
You cut me off.

3192
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:35,490
You cut me out of your life.

3193
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:35,810
Oh, my God.

3194
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:36,930
God damn it.

3195
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:37,850
His cake.

3196
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:39,990
When he was walking away.

3197
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:41,470
Did you guys see him?

3198
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:42,990
I can't stand you.

3199
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:44,670
God damn it.

3200
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:45,370
What is this?

3201
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,090
What should I say?

3202
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:48,870
What should I do to...

3203
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:49,690
I'll comfort her.

3204
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:50,550
No.

3205
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:50,990
Wait.

3206
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:51,710
Please.

3207
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:52,650
What?

3208
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:54,030
Are you talking about me in there?

3209
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:55,750
I wasn't talking about you.

3210
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:59,230
Gonzalo, I can't believe you have to see this.

3211
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:00,850
Oh, comfort.

3212
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:01,830
I comfort her.

3213
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:02,910
I comfort...

3214
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:03,310
Kiss her.

3215
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:04,810
Oh, no.

3216
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:05,710
Don't do that.

3217
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:06,310
God.

3218
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:06,870
Oh.

3219
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,650
Grace, are you talking about me?

3220
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:09,430
What do you care?

3221
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:10,670
You guys, I think...

3222
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:11,710
I don't think she liked it.

3223
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:12,270
Gonzalo.

3224
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:13,090
Oh, shit.

3225
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:15,110
Grace is just so...

3226
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,750
We're talking about me, are we?

3227
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,230
What?

3228
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:21,710
Grace, even though now you're a creative director at this point...

3229
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:25,930
And even though you redecorate the apartment all the time, the truth is, you're not an artist.

3230
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:26,450
Why did you...

3231
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:27,870
I'm sorry.

3232
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:28,170
Wait.

3233
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:28,590
Where'd she go?

3234
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:29,510
Gonzalo.

3235
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:29,930
Uh-oh.

3236
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,050
Oh, my God.

3237
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:31,510
Oh, my God.

3238
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:34,570
Um...

3239
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:36,530
Gonzalo.

3240
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:36,990
Yes?

3241
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:40,370
You see, this is what I've had to put up with for ten goddamn years.

3242
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:42,890
I thought this was a celebration.

3243
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:43,350
Look.

3244
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:44,850
Let's not focus on just me or you.

3245
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:45,770
Let's talk about us both.

3246
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:46,510
Trip.

3247
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,430
Can't you see?

3248
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:48,710
It's the way you speak.

3249
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:50,270
The way you talk to me.

3250
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:50,790
What?

3251
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:51,690
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

3252
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:52,210
I'm not allowed to be angry.

3253
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:52,950
Teleports behind you.

3254
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:53,910
You tell me what to do.

3255
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:54,510
You don't listen.

3256
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:55,550
I love you, Grace.

3257
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:55,830
Gonzalo.

3258
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:55,930
Okay.

3259
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:56,990
I'm not telling her what to do.

3260
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:57,870
I'm trying to help her.

3261
01:35:57,870 --> 01:35:58,290
I'm gonna tell her.

3262
01:35:58,350 --> 01:35:59,530
I love you, Grace.

3263
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:01,110
Look.

3264
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:02,170
Quit the flirting already.

3265
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:03,930
I'm not gonna put up with that at this point.

3266
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:05,130
Jesus.

3267
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,890
Let's keep talking about Grace.

3268
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:07,390
Okay.

3269
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:07,910
Gonzalo.

3270
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:11,150
It's time that Trip finally just admits that our marriage...

3271
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:11,210
Grace, don't.

3272
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:11,710
You don't need to.

3273
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:13,950
Admits that our marriage is not...

3274
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:14,350
Stop it.

3275
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:14,650
Stop it.

3276
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:17,710
Stop interrupting her.

3277
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,030
Wait.

3278
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,130
How do you spell interrupting?

3279
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:21,570
Okay.

3280
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:21,870
Stop interrupting her.

3281
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:23,170
No.

3282
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:24,450
God.

3283
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:28,290
Let's keep our focus on Grace.

3284
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:32,070
You know, Trip, whenever I really try to talk honestly...

3285
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:32,770
You know what?

3286
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:33,970
Gonzalo.

3287
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:34,690
That's it.

3288
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:35,690
You need to leave.

3289
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:36,050
No.

3290
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:39,930
I'm sorry, but I don't know what to do with you tonight.

3291
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:40,050
Grace.

3292
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:40,150
Grace.

3293
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:40,890
He's kicking...

3294
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:41,210
Grace.

3295
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:42,430
He's stopping our love.

3296
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:42,690
Grace.

3297
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:43,950
We'll be fine.

3298
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:44,830
Just go.

3299
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:45,450
Grace.

3300
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:46,450
No.

3301
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:47,470
Grace.

3302
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:49,290
Oh.

3303
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:49,570
Oh.

3304
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:49,890
Oh.

3305
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:54,210
Oh.

3306
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:57,410
Someone said in the chat.

3307
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:58,770
Say I love you.

3308
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:01,050
I tried.

3309
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:03,890
I tried.

3310
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:06,210
Grace.

3311
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:07,430
Grace.

3312
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:09,190
Bye, Charmaine.

3313
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,570
Should have kissed Trip.

3314
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:16,230
It's a very broken relationship here.

3315
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:16,690
Yeah.

3316
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,350
Should have went for the dad.

3317
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:22,710
This is terrifying.

3318
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:23,970
Oh, my God.

3319
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:24,210
Oh, my God.

3320
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:27,650
Oh, Gonzalo.

3321
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:28,910
Oh, Gonzalo.

3322
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:29,630
Oh, Gonzalo.

3323
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:30,510
Oh, Gonzalo.

3324
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:34,050
Can't stop our love, Trip.

3325
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,450
Hop, hop, hop, hop!

3326
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:39,650
Welcome to Bamboo Ship.

3327
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:40,510
Thank you guys so much!

3328
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:41,590
Break!

3329
01:37:42,030 --> 01:37:42,710
Thanks for the 50!

3330
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:43,250
Thank you!

3331
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,790
Thank you for the 50 gift!

3332
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:54,330
It's interesting how very the dialogue can even be.

3333
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:55,370
Into.

3334
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:57,190
This.

3335
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:06,350
We've gotten the one where they stay together and talk things out.

3336
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:10,070
We've gotten the ending where obviously we were kicked out.

3337
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:12,310
We've gotten the ending where Trip walks out.

3338
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:15,510
We haven't... sorry.

3339
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:21,130
We haven't seen Grace walk out.

3340
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:25,790
They're incredibly awful but interesting.

3341
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:28,070
The game was way out of its time.

3342
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:33,830
You can walk around, you can pick stuff up, they interact, you can type whatever.

3343
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:35,410
It's kind of insane.

3344
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:39,590
And then there's so much that's already been recorded.

3345
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,750
So I need to probably... okay, let's do one more.

3346
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:56,410
I know I said that was the last one but we're gonna try and do one more where we side with Trip, unfortunately.

3347
01:38:58,990 --> 01:39:03,350
To... uh... to... um...

3348
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:06,870
Then see if we can get Grace to leave.

3349
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:10,870
One more!

3350
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:11,790
One more!

3351
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:12,670
One more!

3352
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:13,550
One more!

3353
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:14,310
One more!

3354
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:15,890
Bromance route time.

3355
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,170
We're gonna do a really cool handshake together.

3356
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:23,230
Oh, I... oh yes, I could be a girl name this time.

3357
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:23,930
I guess you're right.

3358
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:27,490
Oh, I guess you're right, I guess you're right, I guess you're right.

3359
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:35,370
Does anyone... like... I mean... like... can Grace like get like a knife from the kitchen or something?

3360
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:36,450
Like... or... or Trip?

3361
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:40,690
Can either of them like kind of... like... I wanna see them actually go insane.

3362
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:46,730
Wait, so if we're not Gonzalo...

3363
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,910
Gonzalina?

3364
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,610
Sadly, no.

3365
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:54,450
Dang.

3366
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:55,970
Dang.

3367
01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:58,270
Let's see, what?

3368
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:00,430
There we go.

3369
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:02,130
Amy.

3370
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:03,310
Let's just go with Amy.

3371
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:10,830
Actually, is uh... is Gen... Genivra?

3372
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:12,010
Is that a girl's name?

3373
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:14,530
I wanna see how... I wanna know how that's spelled.

3374
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,490
Lisa, you're tearing me apart, Lisa!

3375
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:23,790
Ippie Minto.

3376
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:26,850
I know, I don't know why I'm so ippie today.

3377
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:32,420
Let's just try it.

3378
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,820
Okay, or there is Lisa.

3379
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,920
Oh, where'd it go?

3380
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,580
Li... Lisa.

3381
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:38,200
Okay.

3382
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:41,280
Let's start.

3383
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:47,730
Oh, hi Mark.

3384
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:53,230
Alright.

3385
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:54,490
We're on Trip's...

3386
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:57,270
We're on Trip's side.

3387
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:57,950
Wah.

3388
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,430
Wah.

3389
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:00,570
Huh?

3390
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:02,850
You told me it'd be an hour from now.

3391
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:04,750
No, she's supposed to be here now.

3392
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:05,410
Oh my gosh.

3393
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:07,170
And they changed everything so it's Tree.

3394
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:07,670
Wow.

3395
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,750
Lisa!

3396
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:11,030
Trip!

3397
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:12,510
I'm so happy you could make it.

3398
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:13,710
Oh, hi.

3399
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:14,290
Yeah, hi.

3400
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:16,830
Wow, it's so great to see you after so long.

3401
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:17,270
Hello.

3402
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,770
Come on in.

3403
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:18,330
Hi.

3404
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:20,830
Well, come in.

3405
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:21,450
Yeah, I...

3406
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:24,190
Uh, it'll be just a sec while I go get Grace.

3407
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:25,510
Ugh, I hate Grace.

3408
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:26,690
Ugh.

3409
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:27,450
Kiss him?

3410
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:28,530
I don't wanna get kicked... wait.

3411
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,570
Should I kiss him while...

3412
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:32,270
Grace is not here.

3413
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:34,530
I should have kissed him.

3414
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:35,010
No, no.

3415
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:35,630
Here we are.

3416
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,110
Bye-bye.

3417
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:38,330
Lisa.

3418
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:39,230
Hi.

3419
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,390
How are you?

3420
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:41,010
I'm...

3421
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:46,210
And I've got to say, you look really good.

3422
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:47,630
Make yourself at home.

3423
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:48,250
Come on in.

3424
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:54,890
Oh, I think we're gonna need to have some drinks first if we're gonna talk about sex.

3425
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:55,410
Oh.

3426
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:56,410
Trip, come on.

3427
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:57,150
That's not funny.

3428
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:03,390
Lisa, I should warn you, I never know how much of what I say is true.

3429
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:07,270
Hey, Lisa, seeing you brings back sweet memories.

3430
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:12,430
You... you think I'm communicative?

3431
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:17,550
Haha, huh.

3432
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:20,530
Oh, you're... you're quite the kidder tonight.

3433
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:24,150
Yeah.

3434
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:24,270
Yeah.

3435
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:28,670
Never afraid to say anything that pops into your mind.

3436
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:29,150
Oh, yeah.

3437
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:30,030
Boobies!

3438
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:33,450
Hey... wait.

3439
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:34,570
Did you...

3440
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:35,070
Yeah.

3441
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,530
Take out the garbage like I asked you to?

3442
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:38,830
Oh, good question.

3443
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:39,010
What?

3444
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:39,050
The garbage?

3445
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:40,110
Yes.

3446
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:41,950
Did you take out the garbage under the kitchen sink?

3447
01:42:45,010 --> 01:42:45,490
Yeah.

3448
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:46,230
Yeah.

3449
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:46,750
Oh, alright.

3450
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:47,050
Good.

3451
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:50,010
I just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten that.

3452
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:52,870
Whoa, I just realized something.

3453
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:55,290
When's the last time you were...

3454
01:42:55,290 --> 01:42:56,330
Oh, tonight's a special night.

3455
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:58,270
Oh.

3456
01:42:58,330 --> 01:42:58,730
Yeah.

3457
01:42:58,930 --> 01:42:59,970
Tonight is special.

3458
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:00,690
Intimate.

3459
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:01,570
Lisa, remember...

3460
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:06,370
Uh, well, remember how you introduced us almost exactly ten years ago today?

3461
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:07,070
Don't ignore me!

3462
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:08,350
Yes.

3463
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:13,650
We really want to thank you for years and years of pain.

3464
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:14,570
Sexy time.

3465
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:21,590
Lisa, flirting with me will only make it harder to let you leave tonight.

3466
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:25,450
Don't get carried away, Tripp.

3467
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:27,050
She's just telling you what you want to hear.

3468
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:27,730
What does that mean?

3469
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:32,330
Sexy time.

3470
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:35,510
If I just keep saying sexy time, you think it's a...

3471
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:37,010
Oh, Lisa.

3472
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:40,450
I thought you might like this photo I just put up from our recent trip to Italy.

3473
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:41,450
Italy?

3474
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:43,630
Might like it.

3475
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,750
It's a beautiful picture of the Italian countryside.

3476
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:47,050
Of course she'll like it.

3477
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:49,310
Lisa, come take a look at this.

3478
01:43:49,610 --> 01:43:50,690
Yes, go take a look.

3479
01:43:50,690 --> 01:43:53,730
By the way, anybody join me on the couch if you want?

3480
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:54,530
Tripp, I want you?

3481
01:43:54,850 --> 01:43:55,630
Um, no.

3482
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:59,350
Lisa, what does this picture make you think of?

3483
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:00,730
Romance.

3484
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:01,010
Think of?

3485
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:03,070
Right!

3486
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:03,590
Love!

3487
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:04,570
Romance!

3488
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:08,970
Everything in Italy was so romantic.

3489
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,230
The scenery, the food, the wine...

3490
01:44:10,230 --> 01:44:12,850
I want to go with you, Tripp.

3491
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:17,770
Well, um, but it was the art that was so amazing.

3492
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:18,690
The art...

3493
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,470
Ah, you hate that!

3494
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:20,970
Oh my god, he said the A word!

3495
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:21,610
Art!

3496
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:27,030
I want you, Tripp.

3497
01:44:28,990 --> 01:44:30,890
Wait, wait, what's wrong, Tripp?

3498
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:33,530
Tripp, it's okay if we disagree in front of our friend.

3499
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:34,570
We're not disagreeing.

3500
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:34,890
No, no.

3501
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:36,850
Comfort.

3502
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:38,890
You're hugging me.

3503
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:39,930
Lisa, careful.

3504
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,430
Too much affection can go to Tripp's head.

3505
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:43,390
Right.

3506
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:45,590
It's okay, it's okay.

3507
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:48,970
Well, you're really affectionate tonight, aren't you?

3508
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:50,870
Sexy time.

3509
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,930
Oh, Lisa, how funny.

3510
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:58,450
You're flirting with me.

3511
01:44:58,650 --> 01:44:59,050
I am?

3512
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:03,010
Okay, okay, that's enough.

3513
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:04,270
Let's not go there.

3514
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:07,810
How far can we go?

3515
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:12,630
You know, ever since we got married, Tripp is forever trying to get me to buy new furniture and redecorate.

3516
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,050
Well, really aggressive all of a sudden.

3517
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:15,810
And it's true, I kind of enjoy it, but...

3518
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:16,590
I'm scared.

3519
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:18,810
I'm scared.

3520
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:20,510
Well, um, well, I want to ask you...

3521
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:22,130
You are very, you're very aggressive.

3522
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:25,250
Lisa, you have to look at this room and admit it looks terrible.

3523
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:26,290
Terrible.

3524
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:27,150
I mean, look over...

3525
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:28,390
No, no, no, no, no.

3526
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:30,870
See, Grace loves expensive furniture.

3527
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:36,570
She grew up in this really nice house with really nice couches and fancy dishes.

3528
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:39,010
And she can't live without this stuff.

3529
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:40,390
She's not like other girls.

3530
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:41,950
She doesn't want to wear pearls.

3531
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:47,110
You know, at work, I waste all day designing ads for apartments with perfect views like this.

3532
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:48,250
She wants to wear...

3533
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,690
And it makes me think I want to design it into my apartment.

3534
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:52,590
This view makes me feel like a million bucks.

3535
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:54,470
Oh my gosh, you know, she wants to wear paperclips.

3536
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:55,390
Dammit, I'm wrong.

3537
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:58,510
I simply want a view of trees and green.

3538
01:45:59,290 --> 01:45:59,730
Trees?

3539
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:00,170
What?

3540
01:46:00,450 --> 01:46:00,890
Trees?

3541
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:05,410
Trees are disgusting.

3542
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:10,330
Ah, what a nice surprise and honest answer.

3543
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:11,110
Lisa.

3544
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:12,170
Wait, Grace.

3545
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,910
I don't know where you're getting this.

3546
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:15,210
But that's what you said.

3547
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:17,370
You, you, you, you.

3548
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:19,710
You did that painting on the wall instead of buying it.

3549
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:20,750
Oh, yeah.

3550
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,450
We've seen how your artist friends live.

3551
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,810
As if you could survive that kind of lifestyle.

3552
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:26,970
Give me a break.

3553
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:29,230
Give me, give me a break.

3554
01:46:29,290 --> 01:46:29,610
Lisa.

3555
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:32,470
No, no, no, you're being honest.

3556
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:34,190
I'm being honest?

3557
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:40,390
Okay, well, I was worried there for a bit that you were on tripside tonight.

3558
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:40,930
I am.

3559
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:42,290
Oh, no.

3560
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:43,290
No, no, hold on.

3561
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:43,510
Lisa.

3562
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:44,450
I gotta get back on tripside.

3563
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:47,310
Lisa, stop that.

3564
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:48,450
It's embarrassing already.

3565
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:49,110
God.

3566
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:49,690
Oh.

3567
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:52,530
That's the last one I'll do.

3568
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:53,290
That's the last one I'll do.

3569
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:54,430
Or else they'll kick me out.

3570
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:55,770
So, drinks.

3571
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:56,590
Drinks.

3572
01:46:56,590 --> 01:47:00,770
Chip's favorite pastime is to get the blood alcohol content of his guests higher than his golf score.

3573
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:03,650
Why don't I make us one of my new drink inventions?

3574
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:05,690
I call it Grace's Inner Soul.

3575
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:08,910
It's a mixture of Chardonnay bitters and lots of ice.

3576
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:09,890
I'd love that.

3577
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:10,650
Ah.

3578
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:12,070
Lisa.

3579
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:14,190
You have deliciously wicked taste.

3580
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:14,430
I'm going to make you one of my new drink inventions.

3581
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:14,890
Oh, yes.

3582
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:15,450
It's a secret.

3583
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:17,570
Trip doesn't even like the taste of alcohol.

3584
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:18,230
What?

3585
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:19,770
So, Lisa.

3586
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,410
How does that sound?

3587
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:21,950
Lisa.

3588
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:23,290
Chip's getting a little carried away.

3589
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:23,950
I'd love a drink.

3590
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:25,970
Maybe you just want some juice.

3591
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:26,330
No.

3592
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:27,570
Or a mineral water.

3593
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:28,030
No.

3594
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:28,310
Yeah.

3595
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:28,650
No.

3596
01:47:28,870 --> 01:47:30,530
I'm going to make this drink for us.

3597
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:30,910
Give me the whole bottle.

3598
01:47:30,910 --> 01:47:31,670
Our friend is here.

3599
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:32,750
We're going to enjoy ourselves.

3600
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:33,750
That's all there is to it.

3601
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:34,070
Yeah.

3602
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:34,350
Please.

3603
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:35,810
Everybody loves my drinks.

3604
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:37,370
Hey, everybody loves his drinks, Grace.

3605
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:37,530
You know that, don't you?

3606
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:38,630
Everybody loves his drinks.

3607
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:40,590
Well, of course, Trip.

3608
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:43,150
After all, you got enough practice when you were a real bartender.

3609
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:43,690
What?

3610
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:46,610
In college, you were a bartender.

3611
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:47,850
How do you know about that?

3612
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:50,310
Oh, I know you were trying to keep it a big secret, but...

3613
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:55,250
One time, my friends and I went slumming off campus to some crappy bar in the sticks, and we saw you there.

3614
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:55,690
What?

3615
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:56,410
Oh, that's great.

3616
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:57,570
Oh.

3617
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:58,930
This is bullshit.

3618
01:47:58,930 --> 01:47:59,830
I love bartenders.

3619
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:00,570
No.

3620
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:01,770
You're full of shit.

3621
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:03,530
What's wrong with being a bartender?

3622
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:06,210
What is wrong with that?

3623
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:06,410
What?

3624
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:06,850
What are you saying?

3625
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:09,010
I love bartenders.

3626
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:10,710
What's wrong with being a bartender?

3627
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:11,310
Lisa.

3628
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:12,190
I...

3629
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:13,490
Huh?

3630
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:14,050
Oh.

3631
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:14,410
And you're a bartender.

3632
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:14,830
And you.

3633
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:16,430
I can predict what you'll say.

3634
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:18,910
The way you keep trying to explain everything.

3635
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:21,150
Um, sexy time?

3636
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:24,930
Look, just quit the flirting right now.

3637
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:26,150
I'm warning you.

3638
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:26,910
Goddamn.

3639
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:27,630
Flirt.

3640
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:29,210
What is everybody hinting at?

3641
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:30,330
That I'm a bad person?

3642
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:30,670
Oh, my God.

3643
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:31,890
That I don't love my wife?

3644
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:32,330
What?

3645
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:34,310
Ugh.

3646
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:35,810
All right.

3647
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:36,550
You know what?

3648
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:37,690
Lisa?

3649
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:39,610
I'm going to ask you something.

3650
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,010
Okay.

3651
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:42,950
Grace, Tripp, let me ask our guest a question.

3652
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:43,530
What?

3653
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:45,190
Okay.

3654
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:45,950
Lisa?

3655
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:47,330
Yes or no?

3656
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:52,450
Should a married person be allowed to flirt with other people for fun?

3657
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:53,270
Oh, yes.

3658
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:54,190
What?

3659
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:55,470
Why?

3660
01:48:56,110 --> 01:48:56,630
See?

3661
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:57,650
Oh, yes.

3662
01:48:57,710 --> 01:48:58,290
That's fine.

3663
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:59,410
That's fine.

3664
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:00,430
What?

3665
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,210
What's that look on your face for, huh?

3666
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:05,010
The real truth is, Tripp, you flirt with everybody.

3667
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:05,210
Come on.

3668
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:07,710
The clients at work, our friends, everybody.

3669
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:08,850
You can't help yourself.

3670
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:10,370
You're always looking around.

3671
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:11,850
Our entire marriage.

3672
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:12,870
Goddamn it.

3673
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:14,070
She's gone.

3674
01:49:14,110 --> 01:49:14,350
Yeah.

3675
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,930
Go on.

3676
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:16,010
Get out of my face.

3677
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:17,530
Come here.

3678
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:18,690
I can't hear a freaking look at you.

3679
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:19,370
Come here.

3680
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:19,750
What the...

3681
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:20,010
Oh, hey.

3682
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:20,430
Come here.

3683
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:20,990
Goddamn it.

3684
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:21,270
Come here.

3685
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:21,570
Come here.

3686
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:22,070
Come here.

3687
01:49:22,150 --> 01:49:22,170
Come here.

3688
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:23,350
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3689
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:24,070
Hold on.

3690
01:49:24,170 --> 01:49:25,050
Before she comes back.

3691
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:25,870
Ugh.

3692
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:26,870
Where'd you go?

3693
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:27,450
Oh, no.

3694
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:28,570
No.

3695
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:30,390
Don't do that.

3696
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,490
What, Tripp?

3697
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:32,170
Why are you trying to talk to me?

3698
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:33,030
What's it to you?

3699
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:34,130
I'm trying to kiss him.

3700
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:36,090
Lisa.

3701
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:40,610
Tripp can just be so...

3702
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:41,110
Oh.

3703
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:42,790
We're talking about me, are we?

3704
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:43,470
What?

3705
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:45,030
It's your fault.

3706
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:48,630
Ten years ago, freshly married and just out of college...

3707
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:49,090
You guys are so dramatic.

3708
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:49,930
I need like...

3709
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:52,210
You convinced me to go into advertising instead of art.

3710
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:54,370
...to listen to some relaxing ASMR after this or something.

3711
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:56,550
If it weren't for you, I could be a real artist by now.

3712
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:58,390
Lisa.

3713
01:49:58,650 --> 01:49:59,130
Ugh.

3714
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:00,010
Your art sucks.

3715
01:50:00,650 --> 01:50:01,050
Ugh.

3716
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:02,530
This painting.

3717
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:06,490
Well, see, all I really wanted was something personal.

3718
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:07,210
It's bad.

3719
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:07,670
No.

3720
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:08,290
It's bad.

3721
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:08,730
No.

3722
01:50:08,730 --> 01:50:10,530
Look, there's nothing wrong with the stupid painting.

3723
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:11,350
I guess there is.

3724
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:12,270
Well, it makes me feel like shit.

3725
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:12,830
Ugh.

3726
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:14,390
You feel like that for no reason.

3727
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:14,630
It's bad.

3728
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:15,310
It's bad.

3729
01:50:16,490 --> 01:50:19,410
Look, let's not focus on just me or you.

3730
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:20,930
Let's talk about us.

3731
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:21,210
No art.

3732
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:24,190
Lisa, you blame me for all of this, don't you?

3733
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:24,730
Yes.

3734
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:25,430
See, Grace?

3735
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:26,530
You're the one.

3736
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:27,130
Yes?

3737
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:27,710
Yes.

3738
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:28,530
Oh my god.

3739
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:30,070
You think I'm to blame.

3740
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:31,750
I'm to blame for all of this.

3741
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:32,430
Yes.

3742
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:33,410
Yes?

3743
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:34,090
Yes.

3744
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:39,570
Art bad.

3745
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:41,150
Art...

3746
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:42,150
This is too much.

3747
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:42,250
This is too much.

3748
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:42,850
I can't take this.

3749
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:43,470
Go away.

3750
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:45,410
No.

3751
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:46,810
Just leave me alone for a second.

3752
01:50:46,910 --> 01:50:47,730
I don't want to...

3753
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:48,230
Ugh.

3754
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:51,090
Okay.

3755
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:52,390
Lisa.

3756
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:53,310
You know what?

3757
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:54,390
I think you should leave.

3758
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:55,710
No.

3759
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:58,470
You'll be fine.

3760
01:50:58,670 --> 01:50:59,790
You should just go.

3761
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:00,470
Why?

3762
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:01,930
What happened?

3763
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:04,470
What?

3764
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,180
What happened?

3765
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:20,100
I was too freaky?

3766
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:20,820
No.

3767
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:25,520
I know.

3768
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,260
Did you ever see the AR room this game was made for?

3769
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,840
It's just a guy with a prototype VR goggles and a giant backpack on.

3770
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:32,300
Really?

3771
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,940
I've never seen it.

3772
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,860
Trip rejected me.

3773
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:37,680
But I didn't...

3774
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:40,000
But I didn't do anything.

3775
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:44,260
Another one.

3776
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:45,660
What do you mean another one?

3777
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:47,640
Thank you.

3778
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:50,640
Thank you for the gift, did you guys?

3779
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:51,080
Thank you.

3780
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:52,960
More smooth...

3781
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:58,020
I didn't know he was a bartender.

3782
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:58,940
MMM.

3783
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:00,100
Manless Maiden.

3784
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:03,580
What do you mean?

3785
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:11,060
Wait,

3786
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:19,460
no!

3787
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,260
There's literally Phantom Tax!

3788
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:29,600
Worry, thank you for the Phantom Tax!

3789
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,220
Thank you!

3790
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,400
It wasn't me.

3791
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,640
Someone sent that.

3792
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:37,140
KBarn.

3793
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,620
Blame KBarn.

3794
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,900
KBarn made me read that.

3795
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,360
Can love bloom between a bartender and an artist?

3796
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:47,280
I've learned so much about these two.

3797
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:52,860
That Trip has some really deep rooted problems.

3798
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,260
With his upbringing.

3799
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:59,100
He wants to be one of the Joneses.

3800
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:03,440
He wants to be one of the Joneses.

3801
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:09,080
And Grace hates how she grew up.

3802
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:14,500
And doesn't want to live this fancy lifestyle.

3803
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,500
He has an inferiority complex.

3804
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:17,100
Yes!

3805
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,080
Why does he hate art?

3806
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:21,780
Thank you for the gift.

3807
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:22,600
You have the interesting glitch face.

3808
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:23,020
Thank you!

3809
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,320
He hates occupations in general.

3810
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:31,840
I don't know why...

3811
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,260
Right now, YouTube chat is kinda glitching for me.

3812
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:37,540
So I'm gonna go.

3813
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:38,460
I'm gonna refresh.

3814
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:40,900
I'm gonna refresh!

3815
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,440
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum!

3816
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,300
Bum bum bum bum bum bum!

3817
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:52,570
Wait.

3818
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:53,250
Oh.

3819
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:54,030
Wait.

3820
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:54,490
Hold on.

3821
01:53:54,490 --> 01:53:54,570
Hold on.

3822
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:55,930
YouTube?

3823
01:53:56,910 --> 01:53:57,310
YouTube?

3824
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:58,950
YouTube?

3825
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:01,010
Uh-oh.

3826
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:02,030
YouTube?

3827
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:03,270
Uh-oh.

3828
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,760
I think everything's crashing.

3829
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,400
I think... maybe I'm in trouble.

3830
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:16,440
Oh wait, wait, there we go.

3831
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,000
And... there.

3832
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:26,160
Okay.

3833
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,140
Hold.

3834
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:29,900
Quick while she can't see.

3835
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,320
I can see!

3836
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:30,940
I can see!

3837
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:31,340
I can see!

3838
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,100
That was fun.

3839
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,380
That was interesting.

3840
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,860
That was something for sure.

3841
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:43,360
What?

3842
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:44,400
Why?

3843
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:45,220
Why?

3844
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:46,320
First of all, why?

3845
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,460
I guess we got the quote-unquote good end, right?

3846
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:52,940
Where they talk it out.

3847
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,920
That was a game.

3848
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:58,620
That was a game.

3849
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,720
Gonzalo and Lisa got married.

3850
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:06,300
Gonzalo!

3851
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:11,820
The fact that... the way they say the name so often, it's just really funny.

3852
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:14,560
What's the good ending?

3853
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:15,580
Where they...

3854
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:20,320
You got two good endings, isn't bad.

3855
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,400
Is him leaving a good ending, I guess?

3856
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,080
Oh my gosh, Andre goes, thank you for the 50!

3857
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:26,640
Thank you!

3858
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,620
You guys are insane!

3859
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:32,060
You guys are so crazy.

3860
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:33,160
Thank you so much!

3861
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:36,900
Oh, elevator ending.

3862
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:37,540
That's true.

3863
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,420
That was maybe the best ending.

3864
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:43,260
Just avoid it all.

3865
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:44,880
Leave it.

3866
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:45,580
Leave it to them.

3867
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,320
I don't know why we became a marriage counselor.

3868
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,860
What a mysterious game.

3869
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:53,940
Truly.

3870
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:56,440
Truly mysterious.

3871
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:56,580
Seriously.

3872
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:00,040
If I remember correctly, she is cheating on him!

3873
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:00,660
What?

3874
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:03,640
Oh my gosh, Mr. LBC, thank you for the 50!

3875
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:04,160
Thank you!

3876
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,300
Thank you so much!

3877
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,460
Oh my gosh, you guys are crazy!

3878
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:08,740
Please.

3879
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:12,540
I know that the memberships are not as expensive as usually.

3880
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,620
But like, please.

3881
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:15,020
Please.

3882
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:21,040
Wait, so is that really not her dad?

3883
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:24,540
He's cheating on her too?

3884
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:25,940
Well, she said...

3885
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:30,500
She said that...

3886
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,480
He flirts with everybody.

3887
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:36,700
Domingo, thanks for the gifted!

3888
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:38,060
Ryzen, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3889
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:39,940
Oh my gosh, welcome!

3890
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:40,880
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

3891
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:41,900
Slay, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3892
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:42,260
Thank you!

3893
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:47,000
I think they have a lot of issues.

3894
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:51,980
I think we can all agree...

3895
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,760
That they have...

3896
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:54,840
Issues.

3897
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:56,600
And maybe...

3898
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:57,820
You know...

3899
01:56:57,820 --> 01:57:00,480
If you're in a relationship and you're just like...

3900
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:01,480
Hmm, is this going well?

3901
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:02,960
PluginBeta, thank you for the 50!

3902
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,040
S1, thank you for the 20!

3903
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,280
Jace, thank you for the 10!

3904
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:09,580
Oh my gosh.

3905
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,500
If you are in a...

3906
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,880
If you are in a relationship and you're like...

3907
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:14,580
Man, I have issues.

3908
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:17,440
Or, if you're not in a relationship...

3909
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,980
This is something that...

3910
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:20,340
You...

3911
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:21,860
Are missing out on.

3912
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:23,600
Isn't that so sad?

3913
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:24,940
And...

3914
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:27,260
Alessandro, thank you for the 10!

3915
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,880
Kat, thank you for the 50!

3916
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:30,920
CaseyRaptor, thank you!

3917
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:33,060
Thank you for the 5!

3918
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,020
Sophia, thank you for the 10!

3919
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:34,940
Kuma, welcome!

3920
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:37,040
Dexteria, thank you for the 50!

3921
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,220
Why is everybody giving 50 membership?

3922
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:40,320
My...

3923
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,260
My notifications are never going to end!

3924
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:45,140
Oh my gosh.

3925
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,360
ShadyNoctis, thank you for the 50!

3926
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:47,620
Thank you guys so much!

3927
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:48,200
Thank you!

3928
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:49,940
I have...

3929
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:52,740
I don't even know how many emotes I can commission at this point.

3930
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:53,560
Here, let me see.

3931
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:55,640
I don't even know.

3932
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:58,500
Um...

3933
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:00,420
Memberships.

3934
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,320
Holy cow!

3935
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:05,000
So...

3936
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,320
Oh!

3937
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:05,820
Oh!

3938
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:06,420
Wow!

3939
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:07,120
Hold on.

3940
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:07,840
Let me see.

3941
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:08,180
Okay.

3942
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:10,300
Emoji.

3943
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:11,500
1...

3944
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:12,320
2...

3945
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:12,920
3...

3946
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:13,620

3948
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,040
6...

3949
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,760
7...

3950
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:16,480

3951
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:17,160

3952
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:17,900

3953
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:22,860
11...

3954
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:23,020

3955
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:23,800
17...

3956
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:24,660
18...

3957
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:25,380
19...

3958
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:25,960
20...

3959
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:26,760
21...

3960
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:27,320
22...

3961
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:27,940
23...

3962
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:28,660

3963
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:29,600

3964
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:30,880
26...

3965
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:31,540
27...

3966
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,220
28...

3967
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:32,960
29...

3968
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,780
30!

3969
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:34,800
This is...

3970
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,200
This is not including the ones that I already have.

3971
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,520
31...

3972
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:39,360
32...

3973
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:39,940
33...

3974
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:40,560
34...

3975
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,180
35...

3976
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:41,820
36...

3977
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:42,620
37...

3978
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:44,120
37...

3979
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,140
37...

3980
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:46,260
That might fill it up.

3981
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:50,460
Because it's not letting me add another one, but it's not telling me that I need to get more members.

3982
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,340
37...

3983
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:51,880
38...

3984
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,400
39...

3985
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:01,560
40...

3986
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:02,680
41...

3987
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:02,700
42...

3988
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:02,720
45...

3989
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:02,760
46...

3990
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:02,840
47...

3991
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:04,700

3992
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:05,760

3993
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:10,440

3994
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,280

3995
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:11,540

3996
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:12,440

3997
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:12,820
55...

3998
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,120
54...

3999
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:17,380
Oh, we have all the slots already?

4000
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:18,260
I guess so!

4001
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:24,400
I have to commission so many emotes.

4002
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:28,780
Suffering from success.

4003
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:35,460
37.

4004
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,320
We need some glow sticks?

4005
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,740
There's one with me holding glow sticks.

4006
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:42,500
It's this one.

4007
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,160
It's kind of...

4008
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:44,400
Maybe it's a little smaller.

4009
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:45,940
I'm holding the glow sticks.

4010
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,040
Oh my god.

4011
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:50,700
Emofa, thank you!

4012
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:52,840
Thank you for the Uncle Silva!

4013
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:53,380
Thank you!

4014
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:55,440
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4015
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:57,380
Please, you're gifting too many.

4016
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,460
Everybody gifted a lot last time!

4017
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:02,980
Wow.

4018
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,620
Thank you, guys.

4019
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:13,920
It's a sea of green.

4020
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,820
For real.

4021
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:26,740
I'm curious what the generated stage play is, but it like opens up a...

4022
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:29,580
It opens up like a...

4023
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:34,540
What's it called?

4024
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,560
Is it a text file?

4025
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,100
What is this?

4026
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:42,660
Cannot find the program...

4027
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:44,500
Files...

4028
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,180
Facades...

4029
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:45,980
Stage plays...

4030
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:46,420
Facades...

4031
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:47,260
Stage play...

4032
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:48,300
Text file...

4033
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:49,560
Do you want to create a new file?

4034
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:50,920
Yes?

4035
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:53,600
There's nothing here.

4036
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,620
It's empty.

4037
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:58,540
It's empty.

4038
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:01,600
Can we have a wisp, Emo?

4039
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:02,780
Yes, I will.

4040
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,820
I have many things I must...

4041
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:06,200
Must...

4042
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:09,140
Oh my gosh, Lucy, thank you.

4043
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,560
I have many things I must...

4044
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:12,300
I must...

4045
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:13,300
I must...

4046
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:15,460
Of...

4047
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:15,740
Of...

4048
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:16,420
Of...

4049
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:17,700
Decide on how...

4050
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:18,480
What emotes now.

4051
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:21,600
Oh my gosh.

4052
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:24,980
Hey, boss, YouTube charged my account wrong for membership.

4053
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,680
So here's the rest of it with interest.

4054
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:30,900
Oh, wake up block, thank you.

4055
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:31,500
But yeah.

4056
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,060
Hey, many people have been asking, have you seen Akiba Maid War?

4057
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:38,520
If not, love a live react to the OP.

4058
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,080
Oh, I could probably do that, right?

4059
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:43,580
I'll be honest, I haven't.

4060
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:46,340
I still haven't seen it.

4061
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:46,960
I'm so bad.

4062
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:48,480
I know.

4063
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:49,880
It's like literally...

4064
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:51,100
Made for me.

4065
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,060
Get it?

4066
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:52,940
Made for me.

4067
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:55,940
CrunchyPVJ!

4068
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:57,240
Just like free...

4069
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:59,880
You know, emotes are free, so...

4070
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:01,340
Fake needs, stop!

4071
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:02,140
I...

4072
02:02:02,140 --> 02:02:02,540
Why?

4073
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:03,580
I have...

4074
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:04,020
I can...

4075
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:04,540
I can...

4076
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:05,080
Be...

4077
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:06,920
I am fine with the emotes.

4078
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,020
I just have to find an artist.

4079
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,040
I've gotta...

4080
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,380
I have to find an artist who's...

4081
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:13,300
Who I could be like, can you make 30 emotes?

4082
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:13,800
So...

4083
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:16,340
Oh...

4084
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:16,400
Oh...

4085
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:21,000
Okay, um...

4086
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:21,960
What was I looking up?

4087
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:22,160
Oh.

4088
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,160
Akiba.

4089
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:26,300
Mid-war opening.

4090
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:31,080
Do you think I can just watch it?

4091
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:33,940
I've...

4092
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:34,840
Made...

4093
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:35,440
Nice...

4094
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:35,940
Mints.

4095
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:37,380
Finger guns in my door.

4096
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:40,840
Thank you for the aqua soup bar.

4097
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:41,460
Thank you!

4098
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:42,940
Let me...

4099
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:43,360
I'm gonna...

4100
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:45,560
I'm gonna...

4101
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,260
Give me a second.

4102
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:48,960
No, no, no, no, no.

4103
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:49,900
We're gonna watch it together.

4104
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:51,020
You think it's fine though?

4105
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:51,280
If...

4106
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:52,520
Maybe I won't get copy...

4107
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,740
If I talk enough, maybe I won't get copyright struck.

4108
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:55,660
And I don't...

4109
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:56,540
I won't make it so loud.

4110
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:57,960
Um...

4111
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:58,920
Let me...

4112
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:00,500
Do this.

4113
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,820
Well, I'm just gonna do the same window capture.

4114
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:05,880
Uh...

4115
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:06,640
Made...

4116
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:07,820
Dai...

4117
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:09,340
Kaiten.

4118
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,580
Wait, how do I...

4119
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:21,820
Oh, here.

4120
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:22,360
This one.

4121
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:29,100
I crop it, I crop it, crop, crop, crop, crop it.

4122
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:30,820
Crop, crop, crop, crop it.

4123
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:32,440
Crop, crop, crop, crop it.

4124
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:35,340
Transition?

4125
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:38,700
Transition.

4126
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:40,200
How do I transition?

4127
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:41,820
Hello?

4128
02:03:42,340 --> 02:03:43,020
Why won't you...

4129
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:43,940
Why won't you let me?

4130
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,760
What's going on?

4131
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:51,060
Oh!

4132
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:51,540
Oh!

4133
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:52,240
I'm in stu...

4134
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:52,540
Oh!

4135
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:55,760
For some reason it wouldn't let me...

4136
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:57,580
That's weird.

4137
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:58,020
Okay.

4138
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,920
Time to watch the Akiba Maid Wars opening.

4139
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:05,440
For the first time, I've never watched it before.

4140
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,280
Wow...

4141
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,840
This is from a year ago, when it was uploaded.

4142
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:14,640
Oh, I guess it was from last year, wasn't it?

4143
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,500
Joseph, thank you for your Akasuba!

4144
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:17,380
Thank you.

4145
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:18,800
Finally!

4146
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:21,500
Oh, wait.

4147
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:21,860
Hold on.

4148
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:22,160
Hold on.

4149
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,040
Hold on.

4150
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:28,900
Velen Books!

4151
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:33,600
No!

4152
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:34,160
I'm sorry.

4153
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:35,380
Suika Books!

4154
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:36,680
Suika Books!

4155
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:37,080
It says...

4156
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:40,900
Wait, so if this is...

4157
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,420
If this is... okay.

4158
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:54,000
If this is this area, then that means there's Arcade, and then there's Super Potato, and then this would be...

4159
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,460
It said Tsukimo, but maybe it's supposed to be the Kotobukiya.

4160
02:04:58,660 --> 02:04:59,800
If it's this area.

4161
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:04,560
Wow!

4162
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:10,450
Hey, that's me!

4163
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:14,810
Why is she blocked out?

4164
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,970
Do the characters get introduced?

4165
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:26,110
Oh my gosh, the Momoi!

4166
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,930
The Momoi dokei!

4167
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:32,730
It's so fast.

4168
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:35,990
So this is... this clock is like...

4169
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:38,850
It's really...

4170
02:05:39,810 --> 02:05:41,730
It's like one of those... how do I say?

4171
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:42,470
Oh my gosh, sorry.

4172
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:43,770
It's um...

4173
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:45,570
It's uh...

4174
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:47,010
Yeah, it's very famous!

4175
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:48,190
That's the word!

4176
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:51,970
It's a legendary clock in Akihabara!

4177
02:05:52,010 --> 02:05:53,210
It's right outside the station.

4178
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:59,710
Towards the Radio Kaikan building side.

4179
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:02,330
Legendary clock.

4180
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:05,150
So it's really cool that they included it.

4181
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:09,050
This is such a jam.

4182
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:10,310
Wait, hold on.

4183
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:12,450
I know I keep stopping and like going through.

4184
02:06:12,630 --> 02:06:14,710
But I wanna see like what they include.

4185
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:17,310
Of course, there's a train.

4186
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,320
Which one is this supposed to be?

4187
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:28,380
I guess it's just supposed to be one of the... wait, hm?

4188
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:32,020
Hm, I guess it's maybe... hm?

4189
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,540
What building is this supposed to be?

4190
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:37,740
Actual electronic shop, wow.

4191
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,800
Yeah, they still exist!

4192
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,080
They still exist in Akihabara.

4193
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:44,920
Oh no, Den is huge!

4194
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:04,170
They're so cute, I love their outfits so much.

4195
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:07,750
Wow.

4196
02:07:15,410 --> 02:07:18,650
Are they actually fighting so many people?

4197
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:23,600
Oh cute!

4198
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,220
The confetti...

4199
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:29,620
I'm surprised the confetti doesn't ruin the bitrate.

4200
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:41,760
Why is it such a bop though?

4201
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:44,080
Oh, bop bop bop bop bop!

4202
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,760
But no...

4203
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,400
This area...

4204
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,320
This almost looks like...

4205
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,280
This actually looks like Yodobashi.

4206
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:56,300
It looks like.

4207
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,700
I don't know if it is or not though.

4208
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:58,820
Like Yodobashi camera.

4209
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:01,740
That was so cute.

4210
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:04,120
Such a bop.

4211
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:08,440
I could be getting this area wrong, right?

4212
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:09,880
Because it's...

4213
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:11,100
If it's Kimo...

4214
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:11,740
I don't know.

4215
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:15,740
If it's the melon books...

4216
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:19,340
But it depends on if this is Chuo Dori or not.

4217
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,140
Because it...

4218
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:21,560
Because if it's the...

4219
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:25,420
Sorry, I'm getting all confused now.

4220
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:30,600
I'm getting all confused now.

4221
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:32,060
Tsukumo.

4222
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:33,380
Yeah, Tsukumo!

4223
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:34,100
But...

4224
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,840
The area I'm thinking of...

4225
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,500
See, there's Akibao right there.

4226
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:38,440
Oh, sorry.

4227
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:39,240
Oki...

4228
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:40,220
Oki...

4229
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:40,980
Okibao.

4230
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:44,000
Oki...

4231
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:44,800
Akibao.

4232
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:51,640
Quick, take us to Google Street View.

4233
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,120
You're so right.

4234
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:56,980
Oki...

4235
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:57,560
Okibao.

4236
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:58,560
So funny.

4237
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,040
Akibao?

4238
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:01,480
There's several in Akiba though.

4239
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:04,600
Those are also like...

4240
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:07,620
Popular electronic stores in Akibao.

4241
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,580
Geoguessr Mint.

4242
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:10,360
I'm no...

4243
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:11,040
I'm no...

4244
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:11,920
What's that guy's name?

4245
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,600
It's funny because...

4246
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:19,040
Besides the Suika books...

4247
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:22,420
The opening shows like mostly...

4248
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:24,840
It doesn't show like any of the anime like...

4249
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:25,720
Stuff.

4250
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,600
It mostly focuses on like...

4251
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:27,900
You know...

4252
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:29,620
You can see like the DVD...

4253
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:32,080
Like stores that you can buy and sell stuff.

4254
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:32,660
And then...

4255
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:33,760
There's the computer.

4256
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:35,620
Sembon Store.

4257
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,900
Doesn't focus on all the anime stuff there is around in the area too.

4258
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:46,660
Thanks for the fun stream Mint!

4259
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:47,400
I need to sleep now!

4260
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:47,860
Good night!

4261
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:49,460
Things are hanging out!

4262
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:50,700
Thank you!

4263
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:55,780
Think this might be an alley parallel to the main road.

4264
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,560
I think so too.

4265
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:59,060
But that's why I'm...

4266
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:01,060
That's why my brain is like...

4267
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:01,640
Where are we?

4268
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:06,200
Cuz...

4269
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:06,560
Okay!

4270
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:11,620
This looks like the building that has...

4271
02:10:11,620 --> 02:10:12,500
Well, maybe not.

4272
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:14,940
It looks like the building that has the main dream in it.

4273
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,620
Which would make sense if this were...

4274
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:19,740
If this were...

4275
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:20,960
The Kinokuniya...

4276
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:21,900
Sorry.

4277
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:22,860
Kotobukiya.

4278
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,440
And then if this were the melon books...

4279
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,260
Because the melon...

4280
02:10:27,260 --> 02:10:28,860
But the melon books you have to go...

4281
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:29,920
You...

4282
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:30,680
You have to...

4283
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:32,400
You either go through the...

4284
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:34,140
What's the word?

4285
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:34,860
The...

4286
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:35,360
The...

4287
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,740
The arcade?

4288
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,160
Or you go around to the front?

4289
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:40,180
But this looks like Chuo Dori over here.

4290
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:41,000
So I don't know.

4291
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,480
I don't know.

4292
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:43,500
Oh my gosh.

4293
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:45,060
I'm a fake Akiba fan.

4294
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,080
This anime takes place in the 90s?

4295
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:48,400
Oh!

4296
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:55,580
90s?

4297
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:02,560
The 90s?

4298
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:02,760
Oh!

4299
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:03,720
There was the windows.

4300
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:04,040
Yeah.

4301
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:04,500
That's right.

4302
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:07,240
Where did it go?

4303
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:09,960
They did have the windows.

4304
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:11,860
Oh.

4305
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:12,420
Windmill.

4306
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:13,580
Windmill 95.

4307
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,640
Were there even maid cafes back then?

4308
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:23,980
Mysterious.

4309
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:25,340
Old-timey Akiba.

4310
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:27,360
Sometimes I...

4311
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,540
There's like...

4312
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:30,820
Sometimes I'll go through like...

4313
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:32,180
Sites that have like...

4314
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:33,960
Old shops and stuff that were in Akiba.

4315
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:35,580
I just like to read about them.

4316
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:43,160
During the maid wars.

4317
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:45,660
That's why there's no maids!

4318
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:46,760
Because they're still...

4319
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:47,400
They're at war!

4320
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:50,180
I get it.

4321
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:52,500
I understand now.

4322
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:53,460
I understand now.

4323
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:56,660
Anyway.

4324
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:58,820
That was...

4325
02:11:58,820 --> 02:11:59,420
That was fun.

4326
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:00,620
That was silly.

4327
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,360
I'm going to...

4328
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:06,600
Move over...

4329
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:08,160
Here.

4330
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:10,820
Hello.

4331
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,140
And I'm gonna...

4332
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:15,600
I'm gonna...

4333
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:16,860
One second.

4334
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:19,880
I'm gonna put on some BGM.

4335
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:21,700
And I'm...

4336
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:21,820
Oh.

4337
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:23,820
Let me exit out of the facade game too.

4338
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:24,660
Exit.

4339
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:25,480
Exit.

4340
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:25,820
Okay.

4341
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:27,000
And...

4342
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,620
BGM.

4343
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:28,120
BGM.

4344
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:28,400
BGM.

4345
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:28,920
BGM.

4346
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:29,400
BGM.

4347
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,560
BGM.

4348
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:31,040
BGM.

4349
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:31,320
BGM.

4350
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:31,460
BGM.

4351
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:31,840
BGM.

4352
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:31,860
BGM.

4353
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:32,160
BGM.

4354
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:32,820
BGM.

4355
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:33,120
BGM.

4356
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:33,440
BGM.

4357
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:37,780
Where was my music?

4358
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:40,500
Why can't I ever find it?

4359
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:56,320
There we go...

4360
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:07,300
Thank you for the ten gifted...

4361
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:08,180
Smash a boo!

4362
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:09,280
No!

4363
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:10,540
Oh!

4364
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:14,760
I want melon bread now.

4365
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:16,780
No, the song is called Lemon Cake.

4366
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,000
You're so close.

4367
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:22,300
You're so close.

4368
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:25,040
I still haven't even...

4369
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:29,640
I'm still using all the same BGM I used to use in the past.

4370
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:31,500
When did I even save this?

4371
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:33,980
July?

4372
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:37,860
Wait, this doesn't make any sense.

4373
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:40,520
It says created...

4374
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:43,120
August 13th, 2020.

4375
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:45,740
But then it says modified...

4376
02:13:45,740 --> 02:13:48,060
July 18th, 2020.

4377
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:53,260
How does that make any sense?

4378
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,440
What?

4379
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:58,420
How was it created in August?

4380
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:04,040
Small brain!

4381
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:05,620
Thank you for the 50!

4382
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:06,140
Thank you!

4383
02:14:10,990 --> 02:14:12,070
Time travel.

4384
02:14:13,150 --> 02:14:14,250
Time travel real.

4385
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:17,390
Time travel real.

4386
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,450
What?

4387
02:14:21,490 --> 02:14:23,670
Is it okay if I can recommend you a video called...

4388
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:26,770
Eurasian waifu air force recruitment video?

4389
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:28,570
Yes.

4390
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:30,370
Just post it in my tag.

4391
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:32,730
Emory!

4392
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:34,130
Why are you gifting me?

4393
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,360
Stop!

4394
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:39,200
Oh my gosh.

4395
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,260
You guys, next week, Emory and... Can I say that?

4396
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:42,720
Can I say that we're gonna collab next week?

4397
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:45,540
Well, I said it.

4398
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:49,760
Gonna collab with Emory next week.

4399
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:53,440
When I was in Japan, Emory and I hung out a couple times.

4400
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:55,740
Yippee!

4401
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:59,160
We went shopping and...

4402
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,500
We got our hair done together and...

4403
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:04,500
It was so fun.

4404
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:07,440
Spoilers.

4405
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:09,460
Spoilers.

4406
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:12,220
I don't know what I'm at all doing next week though.

4407
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:13,880
What are we streaming?

4408
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:16,640
I think we're doing a collab with a lethal company.

4409
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:21,860
And I'm doing mods for the first time ever.

4410
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:26,060
The one mod that I've always wanted to do was the Skinwalker mod.

4411
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,920
Where it copies your voices?

4412
02:15:28,300 --> 02:15:29,120
Oh my gosh.

4413
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:30,880
I'm kind of scared.

4414
02:15:33,980 --> 02:15:35,340
Fukuro, thanks for the 5k did!

4415
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,080
Thank you guys, everybody joining.

4416
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:39,020
Everybody gifting.

4417
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:40,460
Thank you so much.

4418
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:41,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4419
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:45,320
Yeah, there's like a Skinwalker mod that will like...

4420
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:49,620
Copy your voice and then like...

4421
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:53,120
So you'll be, you know, walking through the mines.

4422
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:56,120
Swinging your pickaxe side to side, side to side.

4423
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:58,480
And then you'll hear your friend and you'll be like...

4424
02:15:58,480 --> 02:15:58,940
Oh, hi!

4425
02:15:59,380 --> 02:16:00,820
But it wasn't your friend.

4426
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:01,400
It was actually...

4427
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:02,880
A monster.

4428
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:07,500
It's genuinely so confusing.

4429
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:10,800
The Goku mod!

4430
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:13,700
What's that?

4431
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:17,100
What's the Goku mod?

4432
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,260
Is it just the two of you playing Lethal?

4433
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:24,940
No, we have some other people.

4434
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:28,480
Yes.

4435
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:30,560
We have some other people.

4436
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:33,580
But I've never collabed with them before.

4437
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:36,080
So...

4438
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,640
I'm a little nervous.

4439
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:41,060
Yeah, yeah.

4440
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:47,640
Who is he?

4441
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:49,140
I'm not gonna say.

4442
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:50,740
What about Matara?

4443
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:51,580
I do wanna...

4444
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:53,140
I do wanna play games with Matara.

4445
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:55,720
I don't know.

4446
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,320
Maybe because I talk to her so much.

4447
02:16:57,640 --> 02:16:58,640
Thank you so much!

4448
02:16:58,720 --> 02:16:59,220
Thanks for the gift!

4449
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:00,100
Thank you!

4450
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:03,380
Maybe because I talk with her so much.

4451
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:04,140
Because of the podcast.

4452
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:05,400
I'm just like, you know...

4453
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:07,840
Maybe we're okay.

4454
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:09,260
No, I'm just kidding.

4455
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:11,680
I still do wanna play games with her, but...

4456
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:13,920
I'm trying to...

4457
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:15,020
Um...

4458
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:16,520
Ease myself in...

4459
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:17,680
To...

4460
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,120
Collapse and stuff like that, so...

4461
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,100
I don't know.

4462
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,560
Just because, you know, I don't wanna...

4463
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:29,000
Come and swing in...

4464
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:30,100
When...

4465
02:17:30,580 --> 02:17:31,020
Um...

4466
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:31,760
I just got back.

4467
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:34,940
Yeah, yeah.

4468
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:35,780
Take your time.

4469
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:36,620
Thank you!

4470
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:38,060
Thank you, thank you.

4471
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:39,720
Maybe after the pod season.

4472
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:41,060
Well, I also...

4473
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:43,020
You know, I don't want people to get sick of us.

4474
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:44,640
Like, if we're always on the pod...

4475
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:45,640
And we're always talking...

4476
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:46,460
And...

4477
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:48,520
Um...

4478
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:48,740
We're...

4479
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:49,760
Like, you know...

4480
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:50,660
I don't want it to be like...

4481
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:50,940
Oh, you're...

4482
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:52,040
You guys are collabing too?

4483
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:52,540
Oh my gosh!

4484
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:54,400
I've seen way too much of Minta Matara!

4485
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:55,420
Please!

4486
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,340
Well, obviously, we will be streaming though...

4487
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:03,600
When I go and visit her and she plays Metal Gear, so...

4488
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:04,140
Hmm...

4489
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:04,780
Hmm...

4490
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:05,860
Hmm...

4491
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:08,180
So...

4492
02:18:08,180 --> 02:18:09,680
There's that to look forward to.

4493
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:12,280
Matara overdose.

4494
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:16,540
Hakuna Matara.

4495
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,220
Metal Gear?

4496
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:23,320
No.

4497
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:25,340
So...

4498
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:29,440
I don't know exactly how that's gonna work though.

4499
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:33,460
Are we gonna watch BBC Wildlife videos?

4500
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,040
Stop!

4501
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:34,580
Bye!

4502
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:36,860
My drama.

4503
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,700
I can't believe these people are friends.

4504
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:40,680
I hate that.

4505
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,540
I love you!

4506
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:42,260
I love you!

4507
02:18:42,260 --> 02:18:44,440
NotoriousBSJ, thank you for the live gift and thank you!

4508
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:47,620
Also looking at the...

4509
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:51,780
Some of these are probably older streamlabs, but...

4510
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:56,660
Akiba Maid War Watchalong, the show felt like watching a Yakuza show, but with maids instead.

4511
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,600
Is there like...

4512
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:02,060
Is there like any mystery to it or is it like...

4513
02:19:03,780 --> 02:19:04,740
Just kinda...

4514
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,380
Not violent, but...

4515
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:08,840
I don't know how to say.

4516
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:14,080
Spy animals.

4517
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,120
No spy animals!

4518
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:19,880
A little mystery.

4519
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,480
Plenty of violence.

4520
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,640
It's quite surreal.

4521
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:27,080
Thank you for the 50 gift and thank you!

4522
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:28,860
Thank you.

4523
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:31,160
Oh yeah, the blurred face mystery girl.

4524
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:32,020
Well, I wasn't...

4525
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:33,600
You know how like in some shows...

4526
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:38,720
They'll blur people out or they'll like scratch people out until they're introduced in the show?

4527
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:41,600
I wasn't sure if that was the case.

4528
02:19:42,820 --> 02:19:45,540
I like shows like that though where they change the opening.

4529
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:50,300
They'll reveal more things in the opening as more stuff is revealed in the show.

4530
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:51,040
It's so cool.

4531
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:03,440
Low-key emotion wrecking?

4532
02:20:12,610 --> 02:20:13,090
Azura!

4533
02:20:13,390 --> 02:20:15,070
Thank you for the 50 gift and thank you!

4534
02:20:17,010 --> 02:20:17,870
Gakko Gurashi was great for that.

4535
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:18,230
Yes!

4536
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:19,150
Oh my gosh.

4537
02:20:19,210 --> 02:20:26,130
I think of Gakko Gurashi every time when I think of like that concept.

4538
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:35,910
Gift shower and all.

4539
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:40,650
Why are you guys so nice to me?

4540
02:20:48,590 --> 02:20:49,710
What's going on?

4541
02:20:56,650 --> 02:20:58,330
Did you get Rem on Nikkei?

4542
02:20:58,550 --> 02:20:59,010
You know what?

4543
02:20:59,050 --> 02:21:00,350
I'm not a huge Nikkei player.

4544
02:21:01,390 --> 02:21:02,210
I'm haunted.

4545
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:03,070
I'm glitching.

4546
02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:08,790
I'm not a big Nikkei player.

4547
02:21:09,150 --> 02:21:11,170
I played a little bit.

4548
02:21:13,470 --> 02:21:14,690
How's Fuji-san doing today?

4549
02:21:14,890 --> 02:21:15,570
Let's check.

4550
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:17,470
Fuji-san, update.

4551
02:21:21,930 --> 02:21:23,470
You cannot see Fuji-san.

4552
02:21:23,650 --> 02:21:24,250
It's cloudy.

4553
02:21:25,210 --> 02:21:26,650
That's typically how it is.

4554
02:21:26,730 --> 02:21:28,170
That's one of the reasons...

4555
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:31,330
One of the few reasons I don't like summer.

4556
02:21:31,870 --> 02:21:33,350
It's because it's always cloudy.

4557
02:21:33,890 --> 02:21:34,370
Maria!

4558
02:21:35,990 --> 02:21:37,130
Why are you gifting?

4559
02:21:39,310 --> 02:21:40,170
Thank you!

4560
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:41,790
Thank you!

4561
02:21:43,790 --> 02:21:44,770
Thank you so much.

4562
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:46,310
I hope you've been enjoying Metal Gear.

4563
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:50,710
See ya!

4564
02:21:50,730 --> 02:21:50,870
Bye, gilt meu.

4565
02:21:51,490 --> 02:21:54,070
Bye, gilt meu.

4566
02:21:54,250 --> 02:21:54,890
Bye.

4567
02:21:55,070 --> 02:21:55,190
Bye!

4568
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,430
Bye,

4569
02:21:58,870 --> 02:21:59,990
G - серд.

4570
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:06,590
See you later!

4571
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:08,550
Thank you for being so kind...

4572
02:22:08,550 --> 02:22:09,590
It knew how to talk.

4573
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:15,750
I knew how to talk...

4574
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:22,510
I'm the type that focuses mostly on one gacha game at a time.

4575
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:27,810
So me and Blue Archive, we are tight.

4576
02:22:28,050 --> 02:22:29,870
We are so tight.

4577
02:22:30,390 --> 02:22:32,790
I don't see myself giving up Blue Archive.

4578
02:22:32,810 --> 02:22:39,170
And hopefully I don't see it disappearing from the English side anytime soon.

4579
02:22:39,310 --> 02:22:39,750
Hopefully.

4580
02:22:40,530 --> 02:22:43,610
A lot of YouTubers have been playing Metal Gear Solid lately.

4581
02:22:43,610 --> 02:22:44,150
I know.

4582
02:22:44,810 --> 02:22:45,790
So awesome.

4583
02:22:46,270 --> 02:22:47,330
I wonder why.

4584
02:22:50,890 --> 02:22:52,930
More people should play Metal Gear though.

4585
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:57,410
More people should play Metal Gear and know why it's so great.

4586
02:22:58,590 --> 02:23:00,250
I like Asuna and Karin.

4587
02:23:02,330 --> 02:23:03,570
Unlike Pre-Connect.

4588
02:23:13,210 --> 02:23:14,710
The Master Collection?

4589
02:23:15,070 --> 02:23:17,530
The Master Collection, I think, helps a ton with people being able to play.

4590
02:23:17,610 --> 02:23:22,730
Before, obviously, you had to jump through a little bit of hoops to either, like...

4591
02:23:22,730 --> 02:23:28,850
You know, you could play the GOG Metal Gear Solid, but with all the issues it has...

4592
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:30,570
And then...

4593
02:23:32,050 --> 02:23:32,850
And then...

4594
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:34,050
Um...

4595
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:38,320
Uh...

4596
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:43,100
If you wanted to play it, you'd have to, like, get a PS3 and all this stuff.

4597
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:44,280
And then also...

4598
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:44,780
You have to...

4599
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:46,700
All there was was the HD Collection.

4600
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:48,380
Yeah.

4601
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:49,180
So...

4602
02:23:49,180 --> 02:23:49,860
I get it.

4603
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:51,360
I get why more people are playing it now.

4604
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:54,120
Well, that's it.

4605
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:54,980
Thanks for the fun, Captain!

4606
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:56,460
Thank you, Ducky!

4607
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:01,480
But yeah...

4608
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:02,080
So...

4609
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:06,040
Do you have any ways on how to get into Metal Gear Solid for people who want to?

4610
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:09,560
Play.

4611
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:12,800
Play it.

4612
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:18,120
Blue Archive has many cute and funny...

4613
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:18,460
Yeah!

4614
02:24:18,660 --> 02:24:19,580
They're so cute!

4615
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:21,260
They're so cute!

4616
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:22,340
And they're so goofy!

4617
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:23,480
I love them.

4618
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:24,380
Rico!

4619
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:25,260
Thanks for the fun, Captain!

4620
02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:25,740
Thank you!

4621
02:24:29,850 --> 02:24:32,090
Hoping 4 and Peace Walker come to PC soon.

4622
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:32,710
Me too.

4623
02:24:33,470 --> 02:24:34,470
Me too.

4624
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:37,750
Yeah.

4625
02:24:39,470 --> 02:24:39,970
But...

4626
02:24:39,970 --> 02:24:42,170
There is Master Collection 2.

4627
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:44,390
We'll see what happens...

4628
02:24:44,930 --> 02:24:45,610
in it.

4629
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:47,550
Metal Gear Acid playthrough when?

4630
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:49,330
I do plan on playing it.

4631
02:24:49,410 --> 02:24:51,110
I probably will regret it.

4632
02:24:51,310 --> 02:24:52,270
But I do...

4633
02:24:52,270 --> 02:24:54,290
There will be a time when I will play it.

4634
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:56,090
Shirokuma, thank you for the PC!

4635
02:24:56,890 --> 02:24:57,950
Thank you for the time!

4636
02:24:58,330 --> 02:24:58,830
Thank you.

4637
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:01,030
MGS Lore stream when?

4638
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:03,490
Maybe...

4639
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:03,830
Well...

4640
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:05,610
I mean, we'll have the Lore podcast...

4641
02:25:05,610 --> 02:25:06,630
Oh, not Lore podcast.

4642
02:25:07,070 --> 02:25:08,730
We don't want to spoil stuff for her, right?

4643
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:12,590
Thank you guys for the stream labs as well.

4644
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:16,470
If you're still looking for Mystery Wrecks, I would suggest Summertime Rendering.

4645
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,590
I...

4646
02:25:19,330 --> 02:25:20,370
saw that...

4647
02:25:20,370 --> 02:25:22,790
when I was watching Heavenly...

4648
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:23,750
Delusion?

4649
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:24,710
Is that what it's called?

4650
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:27,270
Heavenly Delusion?

4651
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:33,690
When I always finish an episode, it would recommend Summertime Rendering.

4652
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:36,250
Thank you for the time!

4653
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:36,670
Thank you!

4654
02:25:36,870 --> 02:25:37,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4655
02:25:44,810 --> 02:25:45,190
It was good.

4656
02:25:45,650 --> 02:25:46,690
I love...

4657
02:25:47,470 --> 02:25:48,250
time travel.

4658
02:25:50,330 --> 02:25:51,290
I love...

4659
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:52,110
time travel.

4660
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:53,010
So much.

4661
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:53,950
So...

4662
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:54,910
So awesome.

4663
02:25:55,410 --> 02:25:56,350
I don't know why.

4664
02:25:56,610 --> 02:25:57,630
I love time travel.

4665
02:25:57,970 --> 02:25:58,790
I think...

4666
02:25:58,790 --> 02:25:59,330
I...

4667
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:00,870
I think I must blame...

4668
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:02,070
Girl Who Leapt Through Time.

4669
02:26:03,890 --> 02:26:05,210
You've seen Heavenly Delusion?

4670
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:05,930
Manga is so good.

4671
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:06,770
I haven't read the manga.

4672
02:26:08,850 --> 02:26:09,330
But...

4673
02:26:10,110 --> 02:26:11,770
Oh, the anime was really...

4674
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:13,930
And then also, Bish did the opening.

4675
02:26:14,070 --> 02:26:14,550
So...

4676
02:26:14,550 --> 02:26:14,790
It was good.

4677
02:26:23,350 --> 02:26:24,650
Why are we yelling?

4678
02:26:26,870 --> 02:26:27,810
Why are we yelling?

4679
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:33,770
Have you checked Apothecary Diaries?

4680
02:26:34,250 --> 02:26:37,110
What is the genre of Apothecary Diaries?

4681
02:26:38,070 --> 02:26:38,550
Because...

4682
02:26:40,510 --> 02:26:40,990
Because...

4683
02:26:40,990 --> 02:26:42,430
I've seen a lot about it.

4684
02:26:42,510 --> 02:26:43,910
But I don't know anything about it.

4685
02:26:44,070 --> 02:26:44,310
But...

4686
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:46,490
From what I saw, I thought it was like a...

4687
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:47,570
Shoujo.

4688
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:48,290
Or something.

4689
02:26:48,650 --> 02:26:49,470
Is it a mystery?

4690
02:26:50,610 --> 02:26:51,130
Romance?

4691
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:52,790
It's like a mystery.

4692
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:54,110
Kyler!

4693
02:26:54,150 --> 02:26:55,090
Thanks for the 10-Gifted!

4694
02:26:55,170 --> 02:26:55,850
Thank you!

4695
02:26:58,070 --> 02:26:59,070
It's so...

4696
02:26:59,070 --> 02:26:59,710
It's Anime!

4697
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:00,890
Breaking Bad!

4698
02:27:03,210 --> 02:27:03,730
What?

4699
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:08,190
Historical mystery...

4700
02:27:08,190 --> 02:27:11,210
Romance, mystery and romance.

4701
02:27:11,450 --> 02:27:11,770
Are you...

4702
02:27:15,290 --> 02:27:16,670
It's like a mystery.

4703
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:18,330
Is it a mystery?

4704
02:27:18,390 --> 02:27:18,630
What is...

4705
02:27:18,650 --> 02:27:22,870
This looks like... This looks like MGS5 is my first game though.

4706
02:27:23,010 --> 02:27:24,470
Let's me be really confused.

4707
02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:27,750
Yeah, I can believe that.

4708
02:27:28,490 --> 02:27:30,210
Hey, I'm Dragon, thank you for the 20!

4709
02:27:30,730 --> 02:27:31,430
Thank you!

4710
02:27:31,770 --> 02:27:32,890
Oh my gosh, you guys are...

4711
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:34,130
No wonder...

4712
02:27:34,130 --> 02:27:35,490
No wonder we hit the...

4713
02:27:36,110 --> 02:27:38,610
No wonder we hit the amount...

4714
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:40,270
The max amount of...

4715
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:42,190
Of uh...

4716
02:27:42,190 --> 02:27:43,190
Oh my god.

4717
02:27:44,370 --> 02:27:44,930
Wait.

4718
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:47,230
Oh my god.

4719
02:27:47,230 --> 02:27:50,290
You guys, I think we have enough members, for real.

4720
02:27:54,470 --> 02:27:56,390
I'm concerned about the Minecraft server.

4721
02:27:59,430 --> 02:28:01,690
I don't think I can make a server this big.

4722
02:28:03,210 --> 02:28:05,300
I don't...

4723
02:28:11,410 --> 02:28:14,370
I've actually never made a server before, so I'm going to...

4724
02:28:16,050 --> 02:28:16,910
Do my best.

4725
02:28:17,470 --> 02:28:18,670
Fukunawa, thanks for the MIME gifted!

4726
02:28:18,750 --> 02:28:19,610
Wait, I said stop!

4727
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:22,790
Stop!

4728
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:24,050
You

4729
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:32,780
probably can't.

4730
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:38,620
Oh my god you guys, stop playing.

4731
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:43,680
What does...

4732
02:28:44,660 --> 02:28:45,160
Like...

4733
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:49,660
Don't people do Minecraft servers for like their...

4734
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:50,600
Patreon...

4735
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:52,080
Um...

4736
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:52,900
Things and stuff.

4737
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:54,880
Poopy!

4738
02:28:58,860 --> 02:28:59,560
Thank you!

4739
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:02,060
But how do they do it though?

4740
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:04,820
Oh my gosh, thank you for the akatsuba, thank you.

4741
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:07,500
Oh, CosmereSupport does it, thank you for the 15!

4742
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:09,380
Nick, thank you for the 5!

4743
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:11,540
Theon, thank you for the 10!

4744
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:12,740
Thank you guys!

4745
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:14,020
Digi, thank you for the 5!

4746
02:29:14,140 --> 02:29:15,140
Foxblade, thank you for the 5!

4747
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:17,720
Billy Joe, thank you for the 10!

4748
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:22,840
But how do...

4749
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:25,480
Those are usually not $2 subs though.

4750
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:27,580
Am I...

4751
02:29:27,580 --> 02:29:29,440
Did I make a mistake?

4752
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,800
Oh, Lopenta, thank you for the 15!

4753
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,640
And Epic...

4754
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:42,860
What do I do then?

4755
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:43,700
What do I do?

4756
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:47,500
If I...

4757
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:50,280
I can't change the price because...

4758
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:51,940
Because...

4759
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:53,420
Okay, this is the issue.

4760
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:55,460
If I change the price, it kicks everyone out.

4761
02:29:55,480 --> 02:29:58,100
And if I...

4762
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:05,740
If I make a higher tier, I think if people gift members, it will default to that tier!

4763
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:08,260
So...

4764
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:11,060
Like, I don't want it to be more expensive.

4765
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:18,940
Like, I know that people, you know, VTuber fans probably have so many memberships that they're subscribed to.

4766
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:22,080
And I want to be like the last person you think about, you know?

4767
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,660
Especially if the...

4768
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:27,960
Especially if there's some people who are like, oh, I'm also a Patreon member.

4769
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:32,420
Then you definitely don't need to be spending so much on...

4770
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:35,780
So much on a YouTube membership too.

4771
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:37,520
Oh my god.

4772
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:41,940
Guess we got the party.

4773
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:43,400
What are you talking about?

4774
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:45,980
How many members are we at?

4775
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:47,300
I don't want to say.

4776
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:47,860
I'm scared.

4777
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:49,900
This is...

4778
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:53,960
This is definitely the most I've ever had though.

4779
02:30:53,960 --> 02:30:54,900
Ever.

4780
02:30:56,760 --> 02:30:57,340
Ever.

4781
02:30:58,420 --> 02:30:59,000
Ever.

4782
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:07,320
Congrats.

4783
02:31:08,940 --> 02:31:09,740
Thank you.

4784
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:10,800
I think.

4785
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,040
So, like seven?

4786
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:16,460
Yeah, about.

4787
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:17,920
Give or take.

4788
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:18,540
You know.

4789
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,960
About seven.

4790
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:21,500
Yeah.

4791
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:23,940
Oh my god.

4792
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:25,080
Thank you guys for joining.

4793
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,200
Thank you guys so much.

4794
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:37,680
This is why I didn't want to open on stream because I knew it would just be a free for all.

4795
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:39,980
And I knew it would be chaos.

4796
02:31:40,340 --> 02:31:43,000
I didn't want to just be sitting here being like, thank you.

4797
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:44,040
Thank you.

4798
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:45,240
Thank you.

4799
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:46,160
Thank you.

4800
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:47,060
Thank you.

4801
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:47,780
Thank you.

4802
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:48,460
Thank you.

4803
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:50,720
Thank you.

4804
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:50,880
Thank you.

4805
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:51,520
Thank you.

4806
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:52,400
See you guys.

4807
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:56,040
The floodgates are open.

4808
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:03,060
Thank you guys.

4809
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:03,920
Thank you.

4810
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:05,020
Thank you so much.

4811
02:32:05,980 --> 02:32:07,400
She hates thanking.

4812
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:10,880
No, I just want to talk.

4813
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:13,140
I want us to, you know, hang out.

4814
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:15,360
Not just me being like, thank you, thank you.

4815
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:15,700
Thank you.

4816
02:32:15,700 --> 02:32:16,080
Thank you.

4817
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:16,420
Thank you.

4818
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:16,780
Thank you.

4819
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:23,880
My Kamiyoshi could never be the last VTuber I think about!

4820
02:32:25,480 --> 02:32:26,160
Stop!

4821
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:26,840
Stop!

4822
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:30,580
It will be sad if your server is not called Outer Heaven.

4823
02:32:31,540 --> 02:32:34,980
Especially since you yourself are out of heaven, technically.

4824
02:32:36,740 --> 02:32:41,860
I will take that consideration, that naming consideration, to heart.

4825
02:32:42,180 --> 02:32:42,860
Yes.

4826
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:44,300
Yes.

4827
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:48,740
I'm excited though.

4828
02:32:49,460 --> 02:32:54,900
Actually I have, next week, if I can get everything kind of set up, I have a stream planned.

4829
02:32:57,340 --> 02:33:00,380
For starting the server at least, and like...

4830
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:05,720
Kind of building a little bit of stuff, so that we can...

4831
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:07,920
I'm scared though.

4832
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:09,280
I'm really scared.

4833
02:33:11,220 --> 02:33:14,420
I don't know, maybe I need to rethink this though.

4834
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:22,020
Because I can't just be like, alright, first come first serve, get into the Minecraft server.

4835
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:22,820
No, I don't know.

4836
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:29,080
Well also, people can have access, but that doesn't mean everybody will be on at the same time, right?

4837
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:35,020
So maybe it's actually okay.

4838
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:37,380
There can be a max limit, but...

4839
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,020
Everyone has access, not everyone...

4840
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:41,520
The limit won't be...

4841
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:45,360
The limit...

4842
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:49,520
The limit does not exist.

4843
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:54,220
Recently, on the plane, they had...

4844
02:33:54,940 --> 02:33:58,140
Did you guys know that they made a Mean Girls movie?

4845
02:33:58,660 --> 02:34:00,600
Well, they had a Mean Girls musical.

4846
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:04,060
And then they made the Mean Girls movie musical.

4847
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:08,640
I don't know.

4848
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:10,880
I don't think I liked it very much.

4849
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,740
I don't think I liked it very much.

4850
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:18,260
The server will lag so bad.

4851
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:23,720
I also missed an opportunity not calling Heaven Zanzibar.

4852
02:34:26,320 --> 02:34:33,440
Yes, let me travel back in time to before I played Metal Gear and say that I'm going to Zanzibar instead.

4853
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:38,620
And everyone will be like, what?

4854
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:41,580
That makes no sense.

4855
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:45,320
Regina George is so pretty.

4856
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:46,780
She is very pretty.

4857
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:48,080
I don't know.

4858
02:34:48,100 --> 02:34:49,180
I just didn't like the...

4859
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:52,940
I felt the songs were like kind of lacking.

4860
02:34:53,460 --> 02:34:55,620
I've never seen the musical before, by the way.

4861
02:34:55,740 --> 02:34:56,140
So...

4862
02:34:56,140 --> 02:35:00,440
I felt like the songs were lacking in like power, except for Regina usually.

4863
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:01,160
But I don't know.

4864
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:01,740
It was also...

4865
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:02,740
It felt like...

4866
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:05,360
Uncomfortable sometimes.

4867
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:08,920
With some of the changes that they made, I was like, huh?

4868
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:10,660
I don't get it.

4869
02:35:10,660 --> 02:35:12,020
Create a time paradox.

4870
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:16,260
Ghost Babel.

4871
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:18,300
I'm still trying to find a copy of Ghost Babel.

4872
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:28,580
Ever play the Ace Combat 7 Special Mission DLC?

4873
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:29,480
I have not played it yet.

4874
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:31,940
Not yet.

4875
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:32,400
Not yet.

4876
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:37,380
E.P.

4877
02:35:37,480 --> 02:35:37,640
Mint.

4878
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:39,320
I'm E.P.

4879
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:43,020
Are you sleepy?

4880
02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:43,280
Sleepy, sleepy?

4881
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:52,200
You'll probably never see More than 50% members log into the Minecraft server at once...

4882
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:53,400
Yeah, but like...

4883
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:56,340
I worry if I stream it?

4884
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,300
Like, what if people would...

4885
02:35:59,300 --> 02:36:02,800
I wonder if there is a way that I may get so people can login while I'm streaming.

4886
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:07,260
But like, I'll obviously login off stream.

4887
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:18,520
But I wonder if there is a way that I could be able to fit in the Minecraft server for You're not allowed in while I'm streaming, but I'm also scared of what I'll see.

4888
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:25,660
Oh my goodness, thank you for the birthday gift!

4889
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:26,200
Thank you!

4890
02:36:31,870 --> 02:36:37,750
I have a lot to... I have a lot to learn and experiment with.

4891
02:36:38,650 --> 02:36:42,710
Please be patient with me.

4892
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:45,970
Maybe have multiple servers?

4893
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:46,990
Maybe.

4894
02:36:48,930 --> 02:36:52,490
But what if I show one server more love than the other?

4895
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:54,430
That's not so good, right?

4896
02:36:55,010 --> 02:36:55,790
I don't know.

4897
02:36:58,030 --> 02:37:01,130
I don't know.

4898
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:06,450
The servers are going to compete!

4899
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:09,410
Oh my gosh, some people will be like, I'm server.

4900
02:37:09,630 --> 02:37:10,550
I'm servers and I'm servers.

4901
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:12,190
I'm server Atorheaven.

4902
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:18,910
And then they'll be like, oh my gosh, okay, we're going to organize... we're going to organize a takedown of Atorheaven.

4903
02:37:19,170 --> 02:37:22,350
We're going to storm in there and we're going to burn everybody's houses!

4904
02:37:23,690 --> 02:37:24,750
What if that happens?

4905
02:37:27,390 --> 02:37:28,470
There will be war!

4906
02:37:29,710 --> 02:37:30,910
Server Rex and Rey.

4907
02:37:33,810 --> 02:37:34,290
Server...

4908
02:37:34,290 --> 02:37:35,390
Server Shagohan.

4909
02:37:37,650 --> 02:37:38,510
Not the factions.

4910
02:37:43,590 --> 02:37:45,030
Made wars!

4911
02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:52,670
I can't stop yawning.

4912
02:37:54,750 --> 02:37:55,770
I don't know.

4913
02:37:55,870 --> 02:37:58,590
I'll get some advice from people and see what I do.

4914
02:38:00,390 --> 02:38:01,110
Luckily...

4915
02:38:02,010 --> 02:38:09,190
Luckily I didn't write Minecraft server access in the perks of joining membership, so...

4916
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:11,890
So...

4917
02:38:11,890 --> 02:38:12,950
Um...

4918
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:15,190
You know...

4919
02:38:16,930 --> 02:38:17,570
It...

4920
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:18,150
It...

4921
02:38:18,150 --> 02:38:20,210
We could just...

4922
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:21,710
We could just...

4923
02:38:23,070 --> 02:38:24,750
We could just...

4924
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:26,570
Pretend it never happened.

4925
02:38:26,630 --> 02:38:27,570
Give war a chance!

4926
02:38:27,890 --> 02:38:28,050
No!

4927
02:38:29,650 --> 02:38:31,250
You could do a lottery.

4928
02:38:31,810 --> 02:38:34,090
Maybe, but I would feel bad about it too.

4929
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:35,130
I think.

4930
02:38:36,490 --> 02:38:38,370
I think I would feel bad about it too.

4931
02:38:38,510 --> 02:38:38,550
I think I would feel bad about it too.

4932
02:38:41,050 --> 02:38:42,410
Please don't rush, take your time.

4933
02:38:42,670 --> 02:38:43,570
I will, thank you.

4934
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:44,910
I will, I will.

4935
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:55,430
Especially cause SOME PEOPLE KEEP GIFTING SO MANY MEMBERSHIPS!

4936
02:38:56,290 --> 02:38:57,850
Oh my god, your luck is abysmal.

4937
02:39:04,770 --> 02:39:06,570
But also, if it's a lottery...

4938
02:39:06,570 --> 02:39:09,290
I don't even know how I would distribute it.

4939
02:39:10,470 --> 02:39:11,810
Like how would I be like...

4940
02:39:11,810 --> 02:39:12,250
Okay...

4941
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:15,670
I would have to...

4942
02:39:16,490 --> 02:39:17,470
I don't know.

4943
02:39:17,490 --> 02:39:18,390
I don't want to think about it.

4944
02:39:18,650 --> 02:39:19,590
Let's just...

4945
02:39:21,850 --> 02:39:23,750
Well, I'm saving that for futurement.

4946
02:39:24,130 --> 02:39:25,750
I don't need to worry about it.

4947
02:39:26,070 --> 02:39:27,630
Thank you guys for the gift.

4948
02:39:28,110 --> 02:39:28,910
Thank you!

4949
02:39:29,490 --> 02:39:30,930
Thank you guys, thank you.

4950
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:34,050
Hmm...

4951
02:39:34,050 --> 02:39:35,350
Ugh...

4952
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:37,070
But anyway...

4953
02:39:38,050 --> 02:39:39,690
Almost... wait...

4954
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:41,070
As of today...

4955
02:39:41,070 --> 02:39:43,190
It has been one week...

4956
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:44,550
of me back.

4957
02:39:45,460 --> 02:39:46,090
YIPPIE!

4958
02:39:46,250 --> 02:39:47,650
Oh my gosh!

4959
02:39:47,830 --> 02:39:50,190
Happy one week anniversary everybody!

4960
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:55,790
Happy one week to me!

4961
02:39:58,050 --> 02:40:00,050
Happy one week...

4962
02:40:00,730 --> 02:40:02,170
to me!

4963
02:40:02,630 --> 02:40:03,890
Please...

4964
02:40:04,050 --> 02:40:05,790
Stop the...

4965
02:40:06,670 --> 02:40:07,430
gifting...

4966
02:40:07,850 --> 02:40:10,050
of memberships!

4967
02:40:11,610 --> 02:40:14,090
Happy one week...

4968
02:40:14,090 --> 02:40:15,070
to...

4969
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:16,210
me!

4970
02:40:17,890 --> 02:40:18,270
Oh!

4971
02:40:18,550 --> 02:40:20,510
I can't do high notes anymore.

4972
02:40:20,910 --> 02:40:22,150
My throat...

4973
02:40:22,150 --> 02:40:23,630
I wonder if it will ever recover.

4974
02:40:24,010 --> 02:40:26,370
Maybe I need to drink more honey stuff.

4975
02:40:28,650 --> 02:40:30,350
I have in here...

4976
02:40:30,350 --> 02:40:32,590
Well, this is ginger and yuzu.

4977
02:40:34,050 --> 02:40:35,210
I guess that doesn't really help.

4978
02:40:36,510 --> 02:40:38,210
Before in the past, I used to...

4979
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:39,930
Still sick girl?

4980
02:40:40,030 --> 02:40:40,830
I don't think I'm still sick.

4981
02:40:40,950 --> 02:40:41,970
I think it's just that...

4982
02:40:44,190 --> 02:40:45,270
My voice is...

4983
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:48,270
Since my voice was so damaged before...

4984
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:49,870
It's taking a long time to recover.

4985
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:54,570
Or, you know...

4986
02:40:56,390 --> 02:40:57,670
That was also...

4987
02:40:57,670 --> 02:41:00,170
another reason I took some time.

4988
02:41:01,130 --> 02:41:02,110
Sorry, I'm trying to get...

4989
02:41:02,110 --> 02:41:03,430
This voice...

4990
02:41:04,110 --> 02:41:05,310
This voice mint out.

4991
02:41:06,770 --> 02:41:08,330
Another reason I took...

4992
02:41:08,330 --> 02:41:09,070
so long...

4993
02:41:09,710 --> 02:41:11,810
Not took so long...

4994
02:41:11,810 --> 02:41:13,450
Another reason I took some time off...

4995
02:41:14,930 --> 02:41:16,350
The two months in Japan...

4996
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:18,010
Was because I wanted to rest my voice.

4997
02:41:19,750 --> 02:41:20,250
Because...

4998
02:41:20,250 --> 02:41:21,550
Even prior to that...

4999
02:41:21,550 --> 02:41:22,750
I've been having some...

5000
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:25,010
Some issues with...

5001
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:27,470
With my...

5002
02:41:28,070 --> 02:41:30,110
Not my voice giving out, but like...

5003
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:32,430
I could feel it...

5004
02:41:32,430 --> 02:41:33,390
Like getting a little weaker.

5005
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:35,390
So...

5006
02:41:40,350 --> 02:41:41,990
But I think I just need to...

5007
02:41:41,990 --> 02:41:42,810
Take better care of it too.

5008
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:45,710
And you totally did that, right?

5009
02:41:46,210 --> 02:41:47,050
You'd be surprised!

5010
02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:50,470
I would go to...

5011
02:41:50,470 --> 02:41:51,290
Idol shows...

5012
02:41:51,790 --> 02:41:53,830
And I wouldn't scream so loud.

5013
02:41:54,050 --> 02:41:55,430
Like I would do like...

5014
02:41:55,430 --> 02:41:56,750
If I did calls, I would...

5015
02:41:57,390 --> 02:41:59,230
Do them like in my normal voice now.

5016
02:42:00,110 --> 02:42:01,610
I would go so like loud and crazy.

5017
02:42:03,130 --> 02:42:03,690
So...

5018
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:05,290
Didn't you go to karaoke?

5019
02:42:05,750 --> 02:42:06,650
Yeah, sometimes.

5020
02:42:07,010 --> 02:42:08,110
I only went like...

5021
02:42:10,190 --> 02:42:11,930
Like four or five times.

5022
02:42:13,730 --> 02:42:14,970
I didn't go that often.

5023
02:42:17,750 --> 02:42:18,610
What do you mean...

5024
02:42:18,610 --> 02:42:21,490
What do you mean?

5025
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:22,770
I was being good!

5026
02:42:23,550 --> 02:42:24,770
I was being good!

5027
02:42:31,550 --> 02:42:33,050
I was, I promise.

5028
02:42:33,570 --> 02:42:34,570
I was, I promise.

5029
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:38,630
But yeah...

5030
02:42:40,050 --> 02:42:41,270
That's a lot of times.

5031
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:41,970
In two months?

5032
02:42:42,710 --> 02:42:44,110
Five times is not that much.

5033
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:46,430
I think.

5034
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:49,030
I'd go...

5035
02:42:49,810 --> 02:42:51,370
I remember the first time I went.

5036
02:42:53,150 --> 02:42:54,190
And then...

5037
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:57,670
You know, thinking about it now...

5038
02:43:03,450 --> 02:43:04,610
I think I went...

5039
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:06,770
By myself to karaoke...

5040
02:43:06,770 --> 02:43:07,310
Every time.

5041
02:43:07,610 --> 02:43:09,610
I really wanted to go to Pasela.

5042
02:43:10,610 --> 02:43:12,510
Pasela is like one of my favorite...

5043
02:43:13,530 --> 02:43:14,290
Karaoke places.

5044
02:43:14,370 --> 02:43:16,550
Because they have this yummy honey toast.

5045
02:43:16,950 --> 02:43:17,970
That I like to get.

5046
02:43:18,230 --> 02:43:19,870
Thank you for the five gifted thank you.

5047
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:27,980
Your voice needs roughly a week...

5048
02:43:27,980 --> 02:43:30,600
To heal between heavy overuse-ish.

5049
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:32,680
Yeah...

5050
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:33,640
But what about...

5051
02:43:34,260 --> 02:43:35,600
How about sickness?

5052
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:41,060
Pasela is awesome.

5053
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:41,660
Yeah!

5054
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:45,160
But...

5055
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:48,360
And then they have the big honey toast.

5056
02:43:48,500 --> 02:43:50,100
And then they have the small honey toast.

5057
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:51,140
But the small honey toast...

5058
02:43:51,140 --> 02:43:51,900
I don't like it so much.

5059
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,220
Because it's like...

5060
02:43:57,220 --> 02:43:57,740
It's...

5061
02:43:57,740 --> 02:44:00,380
It's too hard.

5062
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:01,960
In my opinion.

5063
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,680
Thank you for the five gifted...

5064
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:04,880
And...

5065
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:08,800
But you need to get...

5066
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:10,460
The big honey toast...

5067
02:44:10,460 --> 02:44:11,760
You need to go with friends or else...

5068
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:13,040
You'll not be able to finish it all.

5069
02:44:14,660 --> 02:44:15,060
So...

5070
02:44:17,220 --> 02:44:18,740
So many memberships...

5071
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:19,520
You're telling me!

5072
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:21,340
Oh my gosh, thank you for the...

5073
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:24,740
I meant I hope your spiritual reawakening...

5074
02:44:25,400 --> 02:44:26,300
Reawakening goes well.

5075
02:44:26,420 --> 02:44:27,600
Take care, sweetie.

5076
02:44:27,980 --> 02:44:29,220
I'm sure you will do great.

5077
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:32,480
Thank you.

5078
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:32,980
Thank you so much.

5079
02:44:34,980 --> 02:44:35,760
Nah, I win.

5080
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:39,540
They're big though.

5081
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:40,340
Hold on, let me get a picture.

5082
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:42,780
Let me get a picture for you guys.

5083
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:43,940
They're so yummy.

5084
02:44:46,040 --> 02:44:47,460
Pasela honey toast.

5085
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:51,840
I wonder if I can find one.

5086
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:52,100
Okay.

5087
02:44:56,120 --> 02:44:56,480
Okay.

5088
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:59,600
This one has like a person in the background.

5089
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:02,040
So you can kind of get like the scale.

5090
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:05,500
Oh my gosh, it's so cool.

5091
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:07,480
If I talk about something, I can just show you guys.

5092
02:45:10,620 --> 02:45:10,980
Wowie.

5093
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:12,000
Wowie!

5094
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:15,920
Okay, I just googled this.

5095
02:45:16,220 --> 02:45:17,580
So I don't know who that person is.

5096
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:18,340
But look how big!

5097
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:20,220
Oh my gosh, it looks so delicious.

5098
02:45:20,220 --> 02:45:23,000
And it's like that nice thick toast too.

5099
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:24,760
And it's like...

5100
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:26,580
I love...

5101
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:27,840
Oh, it's so good.

5102
02:45:28,940 --> 02:45:30,140
It's so yummy.

5103
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:31,180
And they have different kinds.

5104
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:33,320
Like this one...

5105
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:34,840
Holy cannoli.

5106
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:36,860
Look at this one.

5107
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:37,380
Look at this one.

5108
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:41,580
Oh, it's so small.

5109
02:45:44,020 --> 02:45:45,560
Look at that!

5110
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:49,940
It looks so good!

5111
02:45:49,940 --> 02:45:51,440
Oh my gosh.

5112
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:52,760
And each of those little parts...

5113
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:55,420
Some of the toast, the bread...

5114
02:45:55,900 --> 02:45:56,600
Oh my gosh.

5115
02:45:57,920 --> 02:45:59,680
I really wanted to go and get one.

5116
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:01,400
Oh!

5117
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:02,180
Here!

5118
02:46:04,340 --> 02:46:05,580
They show the...

5119
02:46:05,580 --> 02:46:07,720
They show the small size too.

5120
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:11,560
Why is it so tiny?

5121
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:13,340
But it's like not the same.

5122
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:15,800
Because I like the softness of the toast.

5123
02:46:16,040 --> 02:46:16,300
You know?

5124
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:21,980
But yeah.

5125
02:46:22,060 --> 02:46:26,380
This is at Pase La Karaoke places in Japan.

5126
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:28,380
This is at Pase La Karaoke places in Japan.

5127
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:28,480
Yummy.

5128
02:46:32,380 --> 02:46:33,560
So small.

5129
02:46:34,460 --> 02:46:35,460
So tiny.

5130
02:46:37,080 --> 02:46:38,460
And that is toast?

5131
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:39,360
Yeah.

5132
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:40,860
It's toast.

5133
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:42,560
Cubic food.

5134
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:45,200
That's big?

5135
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:46,780
What, the honey toast?

5136
02:46:48,340 --> 02:46:48,840
Are you kidding me?

5137
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:49,420
It's huge!

5138
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:51,920
It's also filled, you guys.

5139
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:53,940
It's like... it's so big.

5140
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:54,680
Hold on.

5141
02:46:54,760 --> 02:46:56,340
Let me see if I can find...

5142
02:47:02,220 --> 02:47:03,700
Uh... I mean...

5143
02:47:04,800 --> 02:47:05,420
Uh...

5144
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,240
It's so big!

5145
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:14,800
Honey toast...

5146
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:15,560
Yes!

5147
02:47:17,140 --> 02:47:18,680
That's what we're talking about!

5148
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:20,260
Bye, Charmin!

5149
02:47:22,380 --> 02:47:23,820
I've had this one before.

5150
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:25,240
Hold on.

5151
02:47:32,590 --> 02:47:33,910
Oh, it's a P&G!

5152
02:47:37,430 --> 02:47:38,110
This one.

5153
02:47:38,150 --> 02:47:39,090
I've had this one before.

5154
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:43,350
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

5155
02:47:43,590 --> 02:47:44,130
Oh my gosh!

5156
02:47:44,590 --> 02:47:45,110
I'm thrilled!

5157
02:47:46,590 --> 02:47:48,170
Thank you so much!

5158
02:47:48,290 --> 02:47:48,810
Thank you!

5159
02:47:49,510 --> 02:47:51,350
I love cinnamoroll.

5160
02:47:51,350 --> 02:47:53,250
I love, love, love cinnamoroll.

5161
02:47:53,390 --> 02:47:54,910
But also, recently...

5162
02:47:54,910 --> 02:47:57,870
I've been pretty into Kogi Myun.

5163
02:47:58,210 --> 02:47:59,650
I think she's really cute.

5164
02:47:59,830 --> 02:48:00,650
But also...

5165
02:48:01,090 --> 02:48:02,550
There was a new...

5166
02:48:03,270 --> 02:48:04,990
There was a new...

5167
02:48:04,990 --> 02:48:06,150
Well, I say new...

5168
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:10,170
I think he was released last year.

5169
02:48:10,390 --> 02:48:11,610
But he's like...

5170
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:13,430
He's like...

5171
02:48:13,430 --> 02:48:13,930
Um...

5172
02:48:14,630 --> 02:48:15,530
What's the word?

5173
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:19,810
He's a ghost that draws...

5174
02:48:19,810 --> 02:48:20,350
Hold on.

5175
02:48:21,350 --> 02:48:21,830
Ghost.

5176
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:25,050
Hanamaru Obake.

5177
02:48:25,230 --> 02:48:26,610
He's so cute!

5178
02:48:27,230 --> 02:48:28,650
Hanamaru Obake.

5179
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:31,030
I'm like...

5180
02:48:31,030 --> 02:48:31,810
You're just like me.

5181
02:48:32,350 --> 02:48:33,630
You're a ghost.

5182
02:48:35,150 --> 02:48:35,810
Hold on.

5183
02:48:36,090 --> 02:48:37,470
Save image.

5184
02:48:37,890 --> 02:48:40,610
Show you guys.

5185
02:48:41,070 --> 02:48:41,890
Look!

5186
02:48:42,310 --> 02:48:43,810
Look how cute!

5187
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:47,190
Oh, he's so cute!

5188
02:48:48,990 --> 02:48:49,770
Hanamaru Obake.

5189
02:48:49,770 --> 02:48:51,010
Hanamaru is like...

5190
02:48:51,010 --> 02:48:51,810
You know...

5191
02:48:51,810 --> 02:48:53,590
Those swirly...

5192
02:48:55,590 --> 02:48:56,630
Teachers like...

5193
02:48:57,090 --> 02:48:59,750
Draw like 100% on your homework.

5194
02:49:01,310 --> 02:49:02,670
It's the big swirly.

5195
02:49:04,290 --> 02:49:05,330
That's what...

5196
02:49:05,330 --> 02:49:05,790
Oh, wait.

5197
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:06,250
Hold on.

5198
02:49:06,330 --> 02:49:06,830
There's a picture.

5199
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:08,350
This, this, this, this, this.

5200
02:49:09,230 --> 02:49:10,730
This, this, this, this, this.

5201
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:11,470
This, this, this.

5202
02:49:13,450 --> 02:49:15,050
You see the hanamaru?

5203
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:16,830
On the ground.

5204
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:17,490
Yeah.

5205
02:49:18,670 --> 02:49:20,030
So, Hanamaru Obake.

5206
02:49:24,450 --> 02:49:25,570
It's literally you!

5207
02:49:25,870 --> 02:49:26,570
It's literally you!

5208
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:27,970
It's me!

5209
02:49:29,810 --> 02:49:31,710
You guys are getting 100% in school?

5210
02:49:32,070 --> 02:49:32,230
You guys are getting 100% in school?

5211
02:49:34,370 --> 02:49:34,850
Man...

5212
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:36,810
Did I talk about my...

5213
02:49:37,450 --> 02:49:39,150
Okay, I'm gonna talk a little bit about the...

5214
02:49:39,150 --> 02:49:40,250
Japan school I went to.

5215
02:49:41,610 --> 02:49:42,090
Because...

5216
02:49:42,090 --> 02:49:45,470
The Japanese school I went to a little bit.

5217
02:49:46,030 --> 02:49:46,510
Um...

5218
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:50,970
I think I mentioned before how I don't regret going at all.

5219
02:49:51,510 --> 02:49:54,030
I had so much fun and I learned a lot.

5220
02:49:55,390 --> 02:49:58,350
I don't remember if I talked about this on stream before.

5221
02:49:58,830 --> 02:50:00,070
You didn't really mention much?

5222
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:02,530
I'm not going to say the name or anything, obviously.

5223
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:08,910
The reason I would choose not to go back...

5224
02:50:10,830 --> 02:50:11,990
What kind of school was it?

5225
02:50:12,050 --> 02:50:14,350
It was a Japanese learning school.

5226
02:50:14,350 --> 02:50:18,410
The reason I wouldn't go back is because...

5227
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:21,010
Well, first of all, they were very flexible.

5228
02:50:22,450 --> 02:50:26,070
I originally wanted 6 months, but they were like, we can't get you for that.

5229
02:50:26,590 --> 02:50:28,470
But we have 2 months we can give you.

5230
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:28,970
And I was like, okay!

5231
02:50:29,330 --> 02:50:30,390
That works fine.

5232
02:50:32,650 --> 02:50:34,550
But when I entered the class...

5233
02:50:35,850 --> 02:50:37,590
There were people there that...

5234
02:50:38,730 --> 02:50:39,170
That...

5235
02:50:41,650 --> 02:50:44,090
There were people there that had been there for like...

5236
02:50:44,350 --> 02:50:45,930
Months and months and months before me.

5237
02:50:46,410 --> 02:50:47,870
And so...

5238
02:50:51,070 --> 02:50:53,270
Wasn't the housing situation an issue too?

5239
02:50:53,510 --> 02:50:54,410
No, not really.

5240
02:50:55,950 --> 02:50:58,770
They helped me get a place.

5241
02:50:59,050 --> 02:50:59,870
Which was...

5242
02:50:59,870 --> 02:51:03,490
The only issue was it was 20 minutes away from the train station.

5243
02:51:03,610 --> 02:51:04,490
And you guys...

5244
02:51:06,410 --> 02:51:07,910
I scammed myself.

5245
02:51:10,110 --> 02:51:11,590
I scammed myself.

5246
02:51:13,070 --> 02:51:13,690
Ugh...

5247
02:51:14,350 --> 02:51:15,230
I still...

5248
02:51:15,230 --> 02:51:17,150
I'm still so angry about it.

5249
02:51:19,050 --> 02:51:19,490
Um...

5250
02:51:20,750 --> 02:51:21,870
Sounds like quite a walk.

5251
02:51:21,990 --> 02:51:23,810
I love walking, so I actually don't mind.

5252
02:51:24,030 --> 02:51:26,110
It was only an issue when I was...

5253
02:51:26,110 --> 02:51:26,990
When I was...

5254
02:51:27,750 --> 02:51:28,810
Late in the mornings.

5255
02:51:30,130 --> 02:51:30,850
JR pass?

5256
02:51:31,190 --> 02:51:31,450
No.

5257
02:51:31,650 --> 02:51:32,670
Not the JR pass.

5258
02:51:32,830 --> 02:51:33,770
I got the teikiken.

5259
02:51:33,970 --> 02:51:35,410
I got the commuter pass.

5260
02:51:35,790 --> 02:51:38,550
Which is like, if you're staying in Japan for a long time...

5261
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:39,750
Highly recommend it.

5262
02:51:39,810 --> 02:51:40,370
If you're like...

5263
02:51:40,370 --> 02:51:42,730
Either going to...

5264
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:44,310
To...

5265
02:51:44,310 --> 02:51:45,290
Like, you know...

5266
02:51:45,290 --> 02:51:47,710
Like for me, I'm going to the same place every day.

5267
02:51:48,730 --> 02:51:49,850
And so...

5268
02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:52,150
When you get the pass, you choose...

5269
02:51:52,150 --> 02:51:52,950
Two different stations.

5270
02:51:53,370 --> 02:51:55,790
And every station in between that...

5271
02:51:55,790 --> 02:51:57,030
Is also...

5272
02:51:58,130 --> 02:51:59,190
Included in the pass.

5273
02:52:01,730 --> 02:52:02,290
So...

5274
02:52:03,410 --> 02:52:05,970
It's super duper duper super handy.

5275
02:52:06,450 --> 02:52:08,270
I got one once too.

5276
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:10,350
When I actually worked in Akihabara.

5277
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:11,270
For a little bit.

5278
02:52:11,330 --> 02:52:13,810
And I got it from my school to...

5279
02:52:14,250 --> 02:52:15,490
This was years ago.

5280
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:17,250
But I got it from my school to Akihabara.

5281
02:52:17,350 --> 02:52:20,250
So I could go to Akihabara as often as I want.

5282
02:52:20,730 --> 02:52:22,350
I mean, I would say free.

5283
02:52:22,470 --> 02:52:24,170
But I paid for it.

5284
02:52:24,310 --> 02:52:24,670
So...

5285
02:52:25,790 --> 02:52:27,210
But yeah, the teikiken.

5286
02:52:32,310 --> 02:52:33,110
And so...

5287
02:52:34,890 --> 02:52:36,050
I got it.

5288
02:52:36,750 --> 02:52:37,750
Oh, how do I say...

5289
02:52:37,750 --> 02:52:37,890
Okay.

5290
02:52:40,370 --> 02:52:41,470
The station's name...

5291
02:52:42,230 --> 02:52:43,090
Was kind of weird.

5292
02:52:43,610 --> 02:52:46,270
I don't know how to describe it without saying it exactly.

5293
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:48,810
Um...

5294
02:52:50,070 --> 02:52:50,630
But...

5295
02:52:50,630 --> 02:52:51,530
Um...

5296
02:52:51,530 --> 02:52:53,450
When I was putting in the stations...

5297
02:52:53,450 --> 02:52:55,490
I got the station that I was...

5298
02:52:55,490 --> 02:52:58,650
The station that I went to...

5299
02:52:58,650 --> 02:52:59,570
By my apartment.

5300
02:53:01,070 --> 02:53:01,630
To...

5301
02:53:02,370 --> 02:53:04,070
And I thought I put in...

5302
02:53:05,510 --> 02:53:06,630
My station...

5303
02:53:06,630 --> 02:53:08,530
That I got off for school.

5304
02:53:08,950 --> 02:53:09,690
But no.

5305
02:53:10,370 --> 02:53:11,790
I put in...

5306
02:53:13,850 --> 02:53:15,150
I put in a...

5307
02:53:15,150 --> 02:53:16,150
I put in...

5308
02:53:16,150 --> 02:53:17,610
I didn't realize that I...

5309
02:53:18,170 --> 02:53:19,390
Missed a part on it.

5310
02:53:20,850 --> 02:53:21,810
And so...

5311
02:53:22,210 --> 02:53:23,510
I paid like...

5312
02:53:24,390 --> 02:53:26,730
A hundred and fifty dollars for it.

5313
02:53:26,850 --> 02:53:28,350
Because I had it last...

5314
02:53:28,350 --> 02:53:28,910
Two months.

5315
02:53:31,550 --> 02:53:32,510
And um...

5316
02:53:33,590 --> 02:53:34,510
No, I'm sorry.

5317
02:53:34,590 --> 02:53:35,090
Just a month.

5318
02:53:35,270 --> 02:53:35,990
It was just a month.

5319
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:37,770
Because I got it kind of late.

5320
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:39,270
Because I was trying to find...

5321
02:53:39,270 --> 02:53:41,850
Right now there's like a SuicaPass shortage.

5322
02:53:42,110 --> 02:53:44,150
So I was trying to find a place that...

5323
02:53:44,150 --> 02:53:45,410
Would print it.

5324
02:53:45,630 --> 02:53:47,610
Um... I could not find a place that...

5325
02:53:47,610 --> 02:53:48,750
Would even like...

5326
02:53:48,750 --> 02:53:50,350
Allow me to get it.

5327
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:52,450
So...

5328
02:53:54,650 --> 02:53:55,690
It discounted...

5329
02:53:57,250 --> 02:53:58,290
It discounted...

5330
02:53:58,290 --> 02:53:59,230
My...

5331
02:54:00,150 --> 02:54:01,190
My um...

5332
02:54:01,890 --> 02:54:03,390
The amount that I spent.

5333
02:54:03,470 --> 02:54:05,550
But ultimately I ended up like...

5334
02:54:05,550 --> 02:54:06,810
Paying double.

5335
02:54:09,150 --> 02:54:09,730
For...

5336
02:54:10,890 --> 02:54:11,770
For my...

5337
02:54:11,770 --> 02:54:13,050
For my tickets.

5338
02:54:13,350 --> 02:54:15,450
And only... and then because...

5339
02:54:15,450 --> 02:54:17,150
Because the...

5340
02:54:17,150 --> 02:54:20,010
The train was also weird...

5341
02:54:20,010 --> 02:54:21,900
The trains in between...

5342
02:54:22,410 --> 02:54:24,040
The stations in between...

5343
02:54:24,350 --> 02:54:25,750
It only counted...

5344
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:26,470
Some of them.

5345
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:27,170
I know.

5346
02:54:27,250 --> 02:54:27,650
I'm sorry.

5347
02:54:27,730 --> 02:54:28,590
I'm being very vague.

5348
02:54:28,730 --> 02:54:31,090
Because I don't want to like just give away where I went and everything.

5349
02:54:31,350 --> 02:54:31,910
But...

5350
02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:33,570
It was...

5351
02:54:33,570 --> 02:54:37,530
It was so... I was so angry at myself...

5352
02:54:37,770 --> 02:54:38,650
And I realized...

5353
02:54:39,330 --> 02:54:40,970
I was so mad.

5354
02:54:41,390 --> 02:54:42,370
I was like...

5355
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:44,030
It was my fault.

5356
02:54:44,190 --> 02:54:44,510
I...

5357
02:54:44,510 --> 02:54:45,850
I should have double checked.

5358
02:54:46,770 --> 02:54:49,390
Salty commuter's ambling mishap.

5359
02:54:51,870 --> 02:54:52,510
Yeah.

5360
02:54:52,590 --> 02:54:53,470
I feel this frustration.

5361
02:54:53,730 --> 02:54:54,790
Scamming yourself sucks.

5362
02:54:54,910 --> 02:54:55,750
It does.

5363
02:54:56,070 --> 02:54:56,710
It does.

5364
02:54:56,830 --> 02:54:57,170
It does.

5365
02:54:57,590 --> 02:54:58,010
So...

5366
02:54:58,830 --> 02:55:01,590
If you get the commuter pass...

5367
02:55:01,590 --> 02:55:03,430
Definitely double...

5368
02:55:03,430 --> 02:55:03,970
Triple check.

5369
02:55:05,530 --> 02:55:06,090
And...

5370
02:55:06,090 --> 02:55:07,110
Yeah.

5371
02:55:07,230 --> 02:55:08,150
Don't be like me.

5372
02:55:08,730 --> 02:55:09,290
Luckily...

5373
02:55:09,290 --> 02:55:10,470
You know, for me...

5374
02:55:10,470 --> 02:55:12,970
I could afford it but...

5375
02:55:12,970 --> 02:55:14,110
If... you know...

5376
02:55:14,110 --> 02:55:17,590
What if I was in a worse position?

5377
02:55:17,770 --> 02:55:19,010
I would have been like...

5378
02:55:19,010 --> 02:55:21,190
I would have been really suffering.

5379
02:55:21,510 --> 02:55:21,990
So...

5380
02:55:23,710 --> 02:55:24,150
It's okay.

5381
02:55:24,410 --> 02:55:26,490
We're no strangers to scam.

5382
02:55:28,030 --> 02:55:30,790
I honestly don't know if I could have gotten a refund.

5383
02:55:31,050 --> 02:55:31,490
But...

5384
02:55:31,490 --> 02:55:33,390
I felt bad about...

5385
02:55:33,390 --> 02:55:34,410
Wasting the pass.

5386
02:55:34,630 --> 02:55:36,090
If that were the case.

5387
02:55:36,190 --> 02:55:36,730
You know what I mean?

5388
02:55:36,890 --> 02:55:37,510
I don't know.

5389
02:55:38,490 --> 02:55:40,350
I didn't wanna...

5390
02:55:42,010 --> 02:55:42,610
But yeah.

5391
02:55:42,850 --> 02:55:43,470
It's okay.

5392
02:55:44,650 --> 02:55:45,950
We live and learn.

5393
02:55:46,150 --> 02:55:47,810
Or die and learn.

5394
02:55:49,150 --> 02:55:50,150
In my case.

5395
02:55:51,890 --> 02:55:52,550
But yeah.

5396
02:55:52,630 --> 02:55:53,710
About the school...

5397
02:55:54,490 --> 02:55:54,970
I...

5398
02:55:55,690 --> 02:55:56,170
Um...

5399
02:55:56,170 --> 02:55:57,790
I went in...

5400
02:55:57,790 --> 02:56:00,510
Where some of the students were there.

5401
02:56:02,130 --> 02:56:03,870
Many, many months before me.

5402
02:56:04,150 --> 02:56:05,310
And so...

5403
02:56:05,310 --> 02:56:07,750
You know, in the textbook we were learning from...

5404
02:56:07,750 --> 02:56:09,590
It was like lessons...

5405
02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:10,910
I don't remember.

5406
02:56:11,650 --> 02:56:13,330
20... let's just say...

5407
02:56:13,330 --> 02:56:14,450
25 to 50.

5408
02:56:14,630 --> 02:56:15,090
Okay?

5409
02:56:16,090 --> 02:56:17,150
So they...

5410
02:56:17,150 --> 02:56:18,970
Learned from lesson 25.

5411
02:56:19,330 --> 02:56:20,850
The people that were in the class.

5412
02:56:21,150 --> 02:56:22,410
I learned...

5413
02:56:22,410 --> 02:56:23,730
Well, yes.

5414
02:56:24,390 --> 02:56:27,810
Then we had this one big test that...

5415
02:56:27,810 --> 02:56:29,610
Was the entirety...

5416
02:56:29,610 --> 02:56:30,710
Of the book.

5417
02:56:31,490 --> 02:56:33,430
So we took that test.

5418
02:56:33,650 --> 02:56:34,530
Which was...

5419
02:56:34,530 --> 02:56:36,330
Lessons 25 through 50.

5420
02:56:36,610 --> 02:56:39,570
I came in at lesson 40.

5421
02:56:44,390 --> 02:56:45,270
So...

5422
02:56:46,570 --> 02:56:48,050
I was like...

5423
02:56:48,050 --> 02:56:49,850
No way...

5424
02:56:51,430 --> 02:56:53,190
This sucks...

5425
02:56:54,510 --> 02:56:56,650
It sucked so much.

5426
02:56:57,750 --> 02:56:59,070
And because...

5427
02:56:59,070 --> 02:56:59,530
You know...

5428
02:57:02,590 --> 02:57:03,070
I...

5429
02:57:03,070 --> 02:57:05,490
When I properly learned Japanese...

5430
02:57:06,470 --> 02:57:06,950
I...

5431
02:57:06,950 --> 02:57:08,350
You know, that was so long ago.

5432
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:09,470
I forgot so much of it.

5433
02:57:09,830 --> 02:57:11,350
Especially like...

5434
02:57:11,350 --> 02:57:13,210
Tiny things too.

5435
02:57:13,390 --> 02:57:16,410
Like the correct way to use this...

5436
02:57:17,050 --> 02:57:17,530
This...

5437
02:57:17,530 --> 02:57:19,110
Form or whatever.

5438
02:57:19,270 --> 02:57:20,390
So I was like...

5439
02:57:20,390 --> 02:57:22,330
I'm obviously...

5440
02:57:24,250 --> 02:57:26,170
It was just hard trying to catch up.

5441
02:57:26,250 --> 02:57:27,770
But I'm glad because now...

5442
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:28,990
I'm back into like...

5443
02:57:28,990 --> 02:57:30,230
The mindset of studying.

5444
02:57:31,590 --> 02:57:32,070
And...

5445
02:57:32,070 --> 02:57:33,950
I did learn a lot of like...

5446
02:57:33,950 --> 02:57:34,390
Kegel.

5447
02:57:37,290 --> 02:57:37,770
And...

5448
02:57:39,550 --> 02:57:41,190
Yeah, so it was good.

5449
02:57:41,310 --> 02:57:43,250
I do wish also there was like...

5450
02:57:43,250 --> 02:57:44,770
More talking in the class.

5451
02:57:44,870 --> 02:57:45,550
I don't know.

5452
02:57:45,610 --> 02:57:46,670
I feel like that's so important.

5453
02:57:47,570 --> 02:57:48,690
It's so funny though.

5454
02:57:48,790 --> 02:57:50,650
On my first day...

5455
02:57:51,410 --> 02:57:52,750
On my first day...

5456
02:57:52,750 --> 02:57:54,830
It was a pretty small class.

5457
02:57:54,830 --> 02:57:56,050
And someone...

5458
02:57:57,630 --> 02:57:58,150
Someone...

5459
02:57:58,630 --> 02:58:00,410
Someone asked me...

5460
02:58:00,410 --> 02:58:01,250
Like...

5461
02:58:01,250 --> 02:58:03,150
First my teacher was like...

5462
02:58:03,150 --> 02:58:04,910
Oh, Minto!

5463
02:58:05,090 --> 02:58:06,690
Your voice is so cute!

5464
02:58:07,230 --> 02:58:08,030
I was like...

5465
02:58:08,030 --> 02:58:08,850
No, no, no, no, no.

5466
02:58:08,910 --> 02:58:11,550
And someone in the class, this guy, he was just like...

5467
02:58:11,550 --> 02:58:12,510
Are you a Vtuber?

5468
02:58:12,970 --> 02:58:13,590
Oh, no.

5469
02:58:13,630 --> 02:58:14,470
First he asked...

5470
02:58:14,470 --> 02:58:18,070
Are you a voice actor?

5471
02:58:18,370 --> 02:58:19,390
And I was like... No.

5472
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:22,910
And then he goes...

5473
02:58:23,650 --> 02:58:24,510
And then...

5474
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:26,290
I was like... No.

5475
02:58:26,570 --> 02:58:28,710
They were like... You've never done any voice acting work?

5476
02:58:28,790 --> 02:58:30,730
Like your voice is kind of unique.

5477
02:58:31,290 --> 02:58:32,550
I was like... No.

5478
02:58:32,750 --> 02:58:33,130
No.

5479
02:58:33,310 --> 02:58:33,670
I...

5480
02:58:33,670 --> 02:58:35,910
I just... I don't know.

5481
02:58:36,250 --> 02:58:37,490
And then...

5482
02:58:39,190 --> 02:58:40,070
And then...

5483
02:58:40,070 --> 02:58:43,230
While I was leaving, because it was at the end of class...

5484
02:58:43,230 --> 02:58:43,850
They were like...

5485
02:58:43,850 --> 02:58:46,510
The guy, he was just like... She's probably a Vtuber.

5486
02:58:54,370 --> 02:58:54,810
And...

5487
02:58:54,810 --> 02:58:56,610
It was so funny because...

5488
02:58:58,450 --> 02:58:59,170
There was a...

5489
02:58:59,270 --> 02:59:01,270
There was a... I ended up like...

5490
02:59:01,670 --> 02:59:03,050
Him and this other girl...

5491
02:59:03,050 --> 02:59:05,230
We would go and get lunch together after class.

5492
02:59:05,910 --> 02:59:06,910
And like... They would...

5493
02:59:06,910 --> 02:59:09,010
He kept... He would keep asking me...

5494
02:59:09,010 --> 02:59:10,050
He'd be like... Are you a Vtuber?

5495
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:10,890
Are you a Vtuber?

5496
02:59:10,930 --> 02:59:11,510
Are you a Vtuber?

5497
02:59:11,550 --> 02:59:13,310
And I'm like... No, no, no, no, no.

5498
02:59:14,390 --> 02:59:14,750
And...

5499
02:59:16,390 --> 02:59:16,750
And...

5500
02:59:18,270 --> 02:59:18,630
And...

5501
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:20,650
I think at one point I was like... You know what?

5502
02:59:20,810 --> 02:59:22,230
Maybe I'll mess with him a little bit.

5503
02:59:23,630 --> 02:59:24,950
Because he would ask me...

5504
02:59:24,950 --> 02:59:26,870
He would be like... Are you part of this company?

5505
02:59:26,870 --> 02:59:28,610
And I was like... No, no, no, no, no.

5506
02:59:29,630 --> 02:59:29,990
And...

5507
02:59:31,450 --> 02:59:32,930
Like he asked if I was...

5508
02:59:32,930 --> 02:59:33,910
Part of Hololive.

5509
02:59:33,930 --> 02:59:35,150
And I was like... No!

5510
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:38,530
He didn't know Vtubers at all.

5511
02:59:38,610 --> 02:59:39,850
He was just like... That's the only...

5512
02:59:39,850 --> 02:59:41,510
That's the only thing I know.

5513
02:59:41,810 --> 02:59:43,710
And so I was like...

5514
02:59:45,210 --> 02:59:46,190
I was like... No!

5515
02:59:47,150 --> 02:59:48,550
But at one point I was like...

5516
02:59:48,550 --> 02:59:48,870
You know what?

5517
02:59:48,910 --> 02:59:49,910
I am gonna mess with him.

5518
02:59:49,990 --> 02:59:50,870
I was like... You know what?

5519
02:59:51,270 --> 02:59:51,630
Sorry.

5520
02:59:53,570 --> 02:59:54,770
I was like...

5521
02:59:54,770 --> 02:59:56,610
I am a Vtuber.

5522
02:59:58,610 --> 03:00:00,850
And he had a bet going...

5523
03:00:00,850 --> 03:00:02,390
With another guy in our class.

5524
03:00:02,630 --> 03:00:03,270
That I was a...

5525
03:00:03,270 --> 03:00:06,110
That I was a Vtuber.

5526
03:00:06,410 --> 03:00:07,370
And he was like... Yes!

5527
03:00:07,630 --> 03:00:08,490
I'm gonna tell him.

5528
03:00:08,530 --> 03:00:09,170
I was like... No, no, no, no.

5529
03:00:09,390 --> 03:00:10,170
Don't tell him.

5530
03:00:10,190 --> 03:00:10,910
Just like... You know...

5531
03:00:11,510 --> 03:00:14,090
Kind of keep him on his toes or whatever.

5532
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:17,630
And then...

5533
03:00:19,390 --> 03:00:20,130
They would...

5534
03:00:20,130 --> 03:00:21,450
He would try to ask me stuff.

5535
03:00:21,450 --> 03:00:22,170
And the girl too.

5536
03:00:22,250 --> 03:00:22,830
She was just like...

5537
03:00:22,830 --> 03:00:24,330
I can't tell if you are lying or not.

5538
03:00:24,490 --> 03:00:25,610
And I was like... What?

5539
03:00:26,630 --> 03:00:27,470
What do you mean?

5540
03:00:32,270 --> 03:00:32,670
And...

5541
03:00:34,830 --> 03:00:37,050
He would be like... If you are really a Vtuber...

5542
03:00:37,050 --> 03:00:37,810
Tell me a story.

5543
03:00:38,070 --> 03:00:40,690
And I was just like... I can't tell you any story.

5544
03:00:40,810 --> 03:00:41,210
Sorry.

5545
03:00:42,810 --> 03:00:44,470
I was like... I can't.

5546
03:00:44,610 --> 03:00:45,270
You know...

5547
03:00:45,810 --> 03:00:46,750
That's too private.

5548
03:00:47,170 --> 03:00:48,530
I don't want to be found out.

5549
03:00:49,650 --> 03:00:50,050
And...

5550
03:00:51,150 --> 03:00:52,150
And then... Okay.

5551
03:00:53,010 --> 03:00:54,630
This whole... The whole like...

5552
03:00:54,630 --> 03:00:56,730
Two months I was keeping this up.

5553
03:00:56,930 --> 03:00:59,070
And on the very last day...

5554
03:00:59,070 --> 03:01:00,390
We went and...

5555
03:01:00,390 --> 03:01:02,350
The three of us went and got coffee.

5556
03:01:02,570 --> 03:01:04,450
And he looked at me and he was just like...

5557
03:01:04,450 --> 03:01:04,710
You know what?

5558
03:01:04,810 --> 03:01:06,190
You really had me going.

5559
03:01:06,290 --> 03:01:09,010
I really thought that you were a Vtuber.

5560
03:01:16,410 --> 03:01:18,630
And I was like... Gotcha!

5561
03:01:25,530 --> 03:01:27,470
I was so... It was so silly.

5562
03:01:27,590 --> 03:01:29,230
I was like... No way.

5563
03:01:30,030 --> 03:01:32,130
They just didn't believe me at all.

5564
03:01:32,350 --> 03:01:33,110
Like she...

5565
03:01:33,110 --> 03:01:35,630
She was so... They were both very nice.

5566
03:01:35,730 --> 03:01:36,050
But...

5567
03:01:37,850 --> 03:01:39,410
Like... When I say...

5568
03:01:39,410 --> 03:01:40,490
I'm an introvert...

5569
03:01:40,490 --> 03:01:42,150
Like I am a true introvert.

5570
03:01:42,530 --> 03:01:44,770
They were more introverted than me.

5571
03:01:44,970 --> 03:01:47,830
So I'm the one like trying to start all the conversations.

5572
03:01:47,850 --> 03:01:49,530
And I'm just like...

5573
03:01:50,310 --> 03:01:50,810
Uh...

5574
03:01:51,480 --> 03:01:51,730
Uh...

5575
03:01:53,130 --> 03:01:54,970
The weather... It's so hot today.

5576
03:01:55,690 --> 03:01:56,170
Like...

5577
03:01:57,910 --> 03:01:59,570
Like... It was crazy.

5578
03:01:59,650 --> 03:02:01,630
It was crazy how much I was like...

5579
03:02:02,590 --> 03:02:03,070
Um...

5580
03:02:04,730 --> 03:02:06,050
How much I was like...

5581
03:02:06,050 --> 03:02:06,530
Oh my god.

5582
03:02:07,930 --> 03:02:10,270
I'm having to pretend I'm an extrovert here.

5583
03:02:12,490 --> 03:02:14,110
It would be a little awkward.

5584
03:02:14,210 --> 03:02:14,790
It would be.

5585
03:02:14,830 --> 03:02:18,270
Because we would just be eating in silence for a long time.

5586
03:02:20,190 --> 03:02:21,350
But it was good.

5587
03:02:22,470 --> 03:02:24,050
It was still a fun time.

5588
03:02:24,450 --> 03:02:25,430
I got to...

5589
03:02:25,530 --> 03:02:26,790
Do a lot.

5590
03:02:28,050 --> 03:02:29,090
And uh...

5591
03:02:29,730 --> 03:02:30,250
Um...

5592
03:02:31,150 --> 03:02:32,170
Quiet classmates.

5593
03:02:32,430 --> 03:02:34,750
It would be so funny because we would be like...

5594
03:02:34,750 --> 03:02:36,830
Sitting in silence in our classroom.

5595
03:02:38,250 --> 03:02:39,910
There was only ever...

5596
03:02:39,910 --> 03:02:41,690
Six of us at the most.

5597
03:02:43,650 --> 03:02:44,630
In a class.

5598
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:46,170
At a time.

5599
03:02:46,330 --> 03:02:46,770
Yeah.

5600
03:02:46,850 --> 03:02:48,810
And we would be sitting there in silence.

5601
03:02:49,330 --> 03:02:52,010
And we would hear like the class next door.

5602
03:02:53,830 --> 03:02:54,350
Like...

5603
03:02:54,350 --> 03:02:55,590
What do you mean?

5604
03:02:55,630 --> 03:02:56,770
Stop making my own joke.

5605
03:02:56,850 --> 03:02:57,530
Shut up!

5606
03:03:01,790 --> 03:03:04,190
We would hear the class next to us laugh.

5607
03:03:04,390 --> 03:03:06,510
And like be really loud and energetic.

5608
03:03:06,710 --> 03:03:08,070
And we were all just sitting there like...

5609
03:03:08,070 --> 03:03:09,350
How did we all...

5610
03:03:09,350 --> 03:03:12,650
How did we all get in...

5611
03:03:12,650 --> 03:03:14,250
How did this class...

5612
03:03:14,250 --> 03:03:15,610
Be only introverts?

5613
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:16,450
I don't understand.

5614
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:21,890
Laugh...

5615
03:03:22,450 --> 03:03:23,810
Uh...

5616
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:28,390
Ha ha ha...

5617
03:03:28,390 --> 03:03:29,850
But yeah...

5618
03:03:29,850 --> 03:03:30,870
Laugh...

5619
03:03:30,870 --> 03:03:32,610
Cast lighting is fun!

5620
03:03:32,870 --> 03:03:33,890
Oh... wait...

5621
03:03:34,450 --> 03:03:35,710
Laugh...

5622
03:03:36,450 --> 03:03:37,530
Uh...

5623
03:03:37,530 --> 03:03:38,830
But yeah...

5624
03:03:38,830 --> 03:03:40,130
So...

5625
03:03:41,940 --> 03:03:44,650
I did enjoy my time.

5626
03:03:44,870 --> 03:03:46,350
I don't think like... you know...

5627
03:03:46,450 --> 03:03:49,470
I'm not... I never thought like, oh this was such a waste of money.

5628
03:03:52,070 --> 03:03:53,510
I think I had a good experience.

5629
03:03:53,650 --> 03:03:54,970
And I always wanted to...

5630
03:03:54,970 --> 03:03:56,250
Why are you guys spamming?

5631
03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:58,010
Stop it!

5632
03:04:04,690 --> 03:04:06,050
Thank you for the 10 gifts!

5633
03:04:06,070 --> 03:04:06,530
Thank you!

5634
03:04:07,090 --> 03:04:08,910
Are you planning to take the JLPT?

5635
03:04:09,010 --> 03:04:10,330
No, I don't think so.

5636
03:04:10,970 --> 03:04:11,970
I don't think so.

5637
03:04:12,650 --> 03:04:15,190
Maybe if I studied specifically for them.

5638
03:04:15,190 --> 03:04:17,230
But it wasn't that kind of class either.

5639
03:04:19,130 --> 03:04:22,710
It wasn't like, okay, you are taking N2 class.

5640
03:04:23,070 --> 03:04:24,970
It wasn't anything like that.

5641
03:04:25,210 --> 03:04:26,990
Or whatever, so...

5642
03:04:29,350 --> 03:04:30,590
Just to get functional.

5643
03:04:30,790 --> 03:04:31,330
Yeah, yeah.

5644
03:04:31,550 --> 03:04:34,010
I would much rather like...

5645
03:04:35,130 --> 03:04:39,190
feel confident and feel good in my abilities than like...

5646
03:04:39,990 --> 03:04:42,070
I mean, obviously like studying...

5647
03:04:42,690 --> 03:04:44,770
would enhance that too, of course.

5648
03:04:44,770 --> 03:04:46,510
Like studying for the JLPT, I mean.

5649
03:04:49,470 --> 03:04:49,870
But...

5650
03:04:51,170 --> 03:04:53,090
But I would rather just be like...

5651
03:04:53,090 --> 03:04:55,530
Oh yeah, I can talk and hang out.

5652
03:04:55,670 --> 03:04:57,570
And I don't need a piece of paper to...

5653
03:04:58,050 --> 03:04:59,170
to say that or not.

5654
03:05:00,230 --> 03:05:02,650
I took the exam just to see if I'm already on that level.

5655
03:05:02,710 --> 03:05:03,230
That's okay too.

5656
03:05:03,350 --> 03:05:04,870
Like, if you want to take it, go for it.

5657
03:05:07,390 --> 03:05:07,790
But...

5658
03:05:08,730 --> 03:05:09,130
Yeah.

5659
03:05:10,230 --> 03:05:10,630
Yeah.

5660
03:05:11,470 --> 03:05:14,250
Still, I'm still not so Nihongo Jozu, but...

5661
03:05:14,250 --> 03:05:14,770
You know...

5662
03:05:14,770 --> 03:05:18,190
I'm Ganbarimasu-ing my way through life.

5663
03:05:19,970 --> 03:05:22,130
Did you get all Bs?

5664
03:05:23,490 --> 03:05:25,810
No, I got good grades.

5665
03:05:29,330 --> 03:05:30,770
I got good grades.

5666
03:05:31,410 --> 03:05:33,130
Studying Kanji is so difficult.

5667
03:05:33,470 --> 03:05:34,110
It can be.

5668
03:05:35,790 --> 03:05:36,490
I...

5669
03:05:37,960 --> 03:05:39,630
Honestly, so I...

5670
03:05:40,160 --> 03:05:42,990
have found the most help with WaniKani...

5671
03:05:42,990 --> 03:05:43,910
for Kanji.

5672
03:05:44,150 --> 03:05:45,350
But if you're...

5673
03:05:45,350 --> 03:05:47,470
wanting to know how to write it...

5674
03:05:47,990 --> 03:05:48,630
It's impossible.

5675
03:05:48,950 --> 03:05:49,210
Like...

5676
03:05:49,210 --> 03:05:50,650
I can... I can't...

5677
03:05:50,650 --> 03:05:51,690
I can't write anything.

5678
03:05:53,170 --> 03:05:58,010
I can see so many Kanji and recognize them and read them and everything, but I cannot...

5679
03:05:58,010 --> 03:05:59,370
write it at all.

5680
03:06:00,370 --> 03:06:02,010
But WaniKani is really...

5681
03:06:02,010 --> 03:06:03,670
has been the most...

5682
03:06:05,090 --> 03:06:06,770
helpful for me, at least.

5683
03:06:09,410 --> 03:06:10,670
Just use my keyboard.

5684
03:06:10,930 --> 03:06:11,410
Exactly!

5685
03:06:11,790 --> 03:06:12,270
Exactly.

5686
03:06:14,310 --> 03:06:15,990
I mean, there's already...

5687
03:06:15,990 --> 03:06:17,910
Isn't that an issue in Japan too?

5688
03:06:18,010 --> 03:06:20,330
There's people who don't know how to write so much anymore.

5689
03:06:22,490 --> 03:06:22,950
But...

5690
03:06:26,390 --> 03:06:26,850
Yeah.

5691
03:06:27,570 --> 03:06:28,350
I wonder...

5692
03:06:28,350 --> 03:06:29,910
Is that like an issue in like...

5693
03:06:29,910 --> 03:06:30,350
You know...

5694
03:06:31,010 --> 03:06:31,710
Like in...

5695
03:06:31,710 --> 03:06:32,530
Like in China.

5696
03:06:32,710 --> 03:06:33,750
Is that also an issue?

5697
03:06:33,830 --> 03:06:34,890
Where so many people...

5698
03:06:35,890 --> 03:06:36,350
Type?

5699
03:06:36,550 --> 03:06:38,050
That they can't...

5700
03:06:38,570 --> 03:06:39,490
Be Hongo?

5701
03:06:41,250 --> 03:06:42,970
That they can't write so much anymore?

5702
03:06:44,690 --> 03:06:45,870
Yeah, it is.

5703
03:06:48,690 --> 03:06:49,990
What is this?

5704
03:06:50,490 --> 03:06:51,490
What is this?

5705
03:06:54,690 --> 03:06:57,150
It's an issue in the USA too, to be honest.

5706
03:06:57,370 --> 03:06:57,650
Okay.

5707
03:06:57,990 --> 03:06:58,510
So...

5708
03:06:58,510 --> 03:06:59,190
Kind of true.

5709
03:06:59,350 --> 03:06:59,530
Yeah.

5710
03:06:59,810 --> 03:07:02,550
My dad can barely write anymore from living in the States.

5711
03:07:06,250 --> 03:07:06,770
Yup.

5712
03:07:08,470 --> 03:07:08,990
This...

5713
03:07:08,990 --> 03:07:09,410
Yeah.

5714
03:07:10,010 --> 03:07:10,530
Yeah.

5715
03:07:10,630 --> 03:07:11,910
I had to write everything though.

5716
03:07:12,070 --> 03:07:12,950
I have...

5717
03:07:12,950 --> 03:07:14,270
I have calluses on my...

5718
03:07:14,730 --> 03:07:17,550
On my hands from holding pencils.

5719
03:07:17,890 --> 03:07:18,510
I had to...

5720
03:07:18,510 --> 03:07:19,830
I had to hold a pencil.

5721
03:07:20,250 --> 03:07:22,470
My handwriting is so awful.

5722
03:07:23,130 --> 03:07:23,970
It's so...

5723
03:07:23,970 --> 03:07:24,910
Oh my gosh, you guys.

5724
03:07:24,970 --> 03:07:26,570
I realize with the...

5725
03:07:26,570 --> 03:07:29,710
With like some of the Patreon stuff, I have to come up with a signature.

5726
03:07:30,450 --> 03:07:31,510
I don't...

5727
03:07:35,510 --> 03:07:36,870
I don't have a signature.

5728
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:41,830
What do I do?

5729
03:07:42,050 --> 03:07:42,810
What do I...

5730
03:07:44,570 --> 03:07:45,130
Thank

5731
03:07:49,660 --> 03:07:50,260
you for the raid!

5732
03:07:51,560 --> 03:07:52,120
Now...

5733
03:07:52,120 --> 03:07:53,320
I don't have a signature at all.

5734
03:07:55,300 --> 03:07:56,960
I don't even know...

5735
03:07:57,980 --> 03:07:59,020
how to...

5736
03:07:59,020 --> 03:08:01,040
I don't know what to come up with at all.

5737
03:08:04,140 --> 03:08:05,180
Do I...

5738
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:09,780
I'm gonna copy Hanamaru Obake.

5739
03:08:09,940 --> 03:08:11,080
I'm just gonna make it like a...

5740
03:08:11,660 --> 03:08:13,060
It's like that iCuts episode.

5741
03:08:13,180 --> 03:08:14,900
It's exactly like that iCuts episode!

5742
03:08:16,980 --> 03:08:19,940
But my handwriting isn't so fancy.

5743
03:08:19,940 --> 03:08:21,620
So I need something kind of simple.

5744
03:08:22,780 --> 03:08:23,600
I don't know.

5745
03:08:23,740 --> 03:08:24,920
Okay, I'm gonna look up.

5746
03:08:27,540 --> 03:08:28,580
Idol sign.

5747
03:08:30,340 --> 03:08:31,200
How to make an idol sign.

5748
03:08:31,980 --> 03:08:33,920
Wait, I need one that starts with an M.

5749
03:08:34,040 --> 03:08:34,720
I don't know what...

5750
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:37,480
A heart could be an M, right?

5751
03:08:40,640 --> 03:08:41,160
Maybe.

5752
03:08:45,350 --> 03:08:46,330
I don't know.

5753
03:08:50,190 --> 03:08:51,550
Clues, thanks for the Minecrafted!

5754
03:08:52,250 --> 03:08:53,850
If it's upside down...

5755
03:08:54,990 --> 03:08:55,430
No!

5756
03:08:55,970 --> 03:08:57,890
Hold on, I'm gonna... let me open up Paint.

5757
03:08:59,230 --> 03:09:00,110
Let's workshop...

5758
03:09:00,110 --> 03:09:00,650
Oh, wait.

5759
03:09:01,410 --> 03:09:02,870
Let's workshop this a little bit.

5760
03:09:04,110 --> 03:09:05,710
We workshop, we workshop.

5761
03:09:11,270 --> 03:09:11,710
Okay.

5762
03:09:13,150 --> 03:09:14,470
Even though this is on a mouse.

5763
03:09:16,330 --> 03:09:17,410
Even though this is on a mouse.

5764
03:09:17,970 --> 03:09:19,810
So it might... it's already gonna be ugly.

5765
03:09:19,990 --> 03:09:21,010
But don't worry about it.

5766
03:09:21,990 --> 03:09:22,470
Okay.

5767
03:09:23,550 --> 03:09:24,970
Crop, Crop, Crop, Crop.

5768
03:09:24,970 --> 03:09:26,010
Crop, Crop, Crop.

5769
03:09:26,990 --> 03:09:28,190
Crop, Crop, Crop.

5770
03:09:29,830 --> 03:09:30,310
Okay.

5771
03:09:30,930 --> 03:09:31,650
There we go.

5772
03:09:32,550 --> 03:09:33,030
Okay.

5773
03:09:34,190 --> 03:09:36,650
I'm looking up idol signatures right now.

5774
03:09:37,070 --> 03:09:38,170
I'm not gonna copy anyone.

5775
03:09:38,310 --> 03:09:40,270
Wait, this one also has an M.

5776
03:09:40,270 --> 03:09:40,770
And it's cute.

5777
03:09:42,690 --> 03:09:43,170
Ehhh.

5778
03:09:45,150 --> 03:09:45,630
Ehhh.

5779
03:09:45,730 --> 03:09:46,290
Like a...

5780
03:09:48,690 --> 03:09:49,410
Ehhh.

5781
03:09:50,850 --> 03:09:51,570
Ehhh.

5782
03:09:51,990 --> 03:09:52,490
Ehhh.

5783
03:09:52,770 --> 03:09:53,490
Why?

5784
03:09:53,850 --> 03:09:55,370
I is so difficult.

5785
03:09:56,070 --> 03:09:56,670
Ehhh.

5786
03:09:57,230 --> 03:09:57,570
Ehhh.

5787
03:10:00,710 --> 03:10:02,350
Signed in ectoplasm.

5788
03:10:02,350 --> 03:10:03,170
But I want the...

5789
03:10:03,170 --> 03:10:04,170
Okay, hold on.

5790
03:10:04,210 --> 03:10:05,090
Maybe if we do like that.

5791
03:10:05,370 --> 03:10:09,410
I-N-T And then we...

5792
03:10:11,230 --> 03:10:13,830
And then we turn it into a wisp.

5793
03:10:13,990 --> 03:10:14,510
And then we turn it into a wisp.

5794
03:10:15,290 --> 03:10:16,750
Uh, with the...

5795
03:10:21,110 --> 03:10:21,650
And...

5796
03:10:22,590 --> 03:10:23,130
And...

5797
03:10:25,110 --> 03:10:25,650
And...

5798
03:10:25,650 --> 03:10:26,630
Oh, the cat ears.

5799
03:10:26,710 --> 03:10:27,030
Hold on.

5800
03:10:27,470 --> 03:10:27,690
Oh, the cat ears.

5801
03:10:27,690 --> 03:10:27,690
Hold on.

5802
03:10:32,770 --> 03:10:33,850
Oh, the cat ears.

5803
03:10:33,850 --> 03:10:33,850
Hold on.

5804
03:10:35,630 --> 03:10:36,170
Perfection.

5805
03:10:36,350 --> 03:10:36,890
No!

5806
03:10:37,050 --> 03:10:38,210
You guys have to give me feedback!

5807
03:10:39,050 --> 03:10:40,250
Looks like a whale.

5808
03:10:43,970 --> 03:10:45,890
I thought it was a whale.

5809
03:10:47,790 --> 03:10:48,590
Aww, man.

5810
03:10:48,790 --> 03:10:49,110
Okay.

5811
03:10:49,370 --> 03:10:51,090
See, this is why we're workshopping.

5812
03:10:51,090 --> 03:10:52,290
This is why we're workshopping.

5813
03:10:54,870 --> 03:10:55,270
Um...

5814
03:10:57,090 --> 03:10:57,490
Catfish.

5815
03:10:57,570 --> 03:10:57,830
No!

5816
03:11:00,250 --> 03:11:01,390
Like, I'm looking up this one.

5817
03:11:01,430 --> 03:11:02,890
This one has like...

5818
03:11:05,480 --> 03:11:05,880
I...

5819
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:08,960
I hate cursive N.

5820
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:10,160
So we're not gonna do it.

5821
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:11,520
Mint.

5822
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:13,600
And then... Oh!

5823
03:11:14,140 --> 03:11:14,600
Uh...

5824
03:11:21,080 --> 03:11:23,640
I feel like this would look better if it was like...

5825
03:11:23,640 --> 03:11:25,380
In a cute collar...

5826
03:11:25,380 --> 03:11:26,740
And like...

5827
03:11:28,340 --> 03:11:28,800
Oh!

5828
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:30,140
He's back!

5829
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:33,260
Hmm...

5830
03:11:33,260 --> 03:11:35,000
I like mine, like...

5831
03:11:35,560 --> 03:11:36,020
Really...

5832
03:11:37,060 --> 03:11:38,840
Big and curly, you know?

5833
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:42,300
The whale is by an onion.

5834
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:43,400
The whale is by an onion.

5835
03:11:44,620 --> 03:11:45,580
What to do?

5836
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:46,660
What to do?

5837
03:11:47,220 --> 03:11:48,080
Oh, wait!

5838
03:11:48,180 --> 03:11:48,920
What if I do...

5839
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:50,140
Okay, I've seen ones like this too.

5840
03:11:50,540 --> 03:11:51,880
Where it's like a big...

5841
03:11:51,880 --> 03:11:53,220
You know, like that.

5842
03:11:53,360 --> 03:11:54,080
That's the M.

5843
03:11:54,500 --> 03:11:56,920
It doesn't have to make perfect sense.

5844
03:11:57,140 --> 03:11:58,600
Like, it can be like, you know...

5845
03:11:58,600 --> 03:11:59,540
And then we could...

5846
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:02,340
I and T.

5847
03:12:04,100 --> 03:12:05,860
And like, then here...

5848
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:12,160
It's me!

5849
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,520
And then here...

5850
03:12:19,520 --> 03:12:20,560
And then here...

5851
03:12:20,560 --> 03:12:21,340
And um...

5852
03:12:21,340 --> 03:12:21,860
And then here...

5853
03:12:23,420 --> 03:12:24,920
Is that in Among Us?

5854
03:12:25,080 --> 03:12:25,240
No!

5855
03:12:27,060 --> 03:12:28,540
You're not seeing the vision.

5856
03:12:28,820 --> 03:12:30,060
You're not seeing the vision.

5857
03:12:30,120 --> 03:12:31,160
Hold on, let's change this one.

5858
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:33,120
I'm gonna make it a little bit more exciting.

5859
03:12:33,800 --> 03:12:34,700
Like um...

5860
03:12:39,220 --> 03:12:39,880
Like that.

5861
03:12:41,080 --> 03:12:41,560
Um...

5862
03:12:43,020 --> 03:12:43,960
It's a Diglett.

5863
03:12:44,060 --> 03:12:45,700
Oh, now it's just Wobbuffet!

5864
03:12:48,220 --> 03:12:49,960
Would it be better if we did it in Kana?

5865
03:12:50,340 --> 03:12:51,220
So, hi Mitt.

5866
03:12:51,280 --> 03:12:52,300
First time seeing you.

5867
03:12:52,340 --> 03:12:53,080
Hi, Coke's Metal!

5868
03:12:53,320 --> 03:12:54,100
Thank you!

5869
03:12:55,740 --> 03:12:57,620
I could try and do it.

5870
03:12:57,740 --> 03:13:00,020
My name is spelled in Katakana.

5871
03:13:00,060 --> 03:13:00,880
Not Hiragana.

5872
03:13:02,940 --> 03:13:03,440
So...

5873
03:13:04,110 --> 03:13:06,040
I'm thinking Katakana would look...

5874
03:13:06,660 --> 03:13:07,160
Ugly.

5875
03:13:07,700 --> 03:13:08,460
Like, hold on.

5876
03:13:09,480 --> 03:13:10,040
Like...

5877
03:13:10,040 --> 03:13:11,960
Cause Katakana is this.

5878
03:13:12,340 --> 03:13:12,900
Mi...

5879
03:13:15,260 --> 03:13:15,820
Nn...to.

5880
03:13:15,980 --> 03:13:17,480
I can't even write it well.

5881
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:18,680
Mi...

5882
03:13:19,720 --> 03:13:20,280
Nn...

5883
03:13:22,060 --> 03:13:22,620
To.

5884
03:13:26,420 --> 03:13:28,220
There's no way to make this look cute.

5885
03:13:29,060 --> 03:13:29,800
I think.

5886
03:13:30,700 --> 03:13:31,700
As a signature.

5887
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:36,180
Must be Hiragana.

5888
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:37,840
Mi...

5889
03:13:38,460 --> 03:13:39,320
Kana is so much cuter.

5890
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:41,180
I'm such a fool.

5891
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:43,020
Why didn't I write my name in Hiragana?

5892
03:13:43,320 --> 03:13:44,580
I'm gonna change it today.

5893
03:13:45,360 --> 03:13:45,700
Mi...

5894
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:46,140
Nn...to.

5895
03:13:50,860 --> 03:13:51,420
Hmm...

5896
03:13:53,160 --> 03:13:53,720
Hmm...

5897
03:13:53,720 --> 03:13:53,880
Hmm...

5898
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:55,480
Mi...

5899
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:55,820
Nn...to.

5900
03:13:56,240 --> 03:13:57,560
Not Mi...

5901
03:13:57,560 --> 03:13:58,160
Nn...to.

5902
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:01,800
Give us your best...

5903
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:03,360
Wobbuffet!

5904
03:14:06,340 --> 03:14:06,900
...

5905
03:14:06,900 --> 03:14:07,700
...

5906
03:14:08,540 --> 03:14:09,100
...

5907
03:14:10,200 --> 03:14:10,760
...

5908
03:14:10,760 --> 03:14:11,060
...

5909
03:14:15,280 --> 03:14:16,540
Look at this one.

5910
03:14:16,940 --> 03:14:18,020
This is what...

5911
03:14:18,020 --> 03:14:21,020
Look at this one.

5912
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:22,020
Hold on, I'm gonna save it.

5913
03:14:23,060 --> 03:14:25,120
This is what we're aiming for, you guys.

5914
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:27,000
This level of...

5915
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:27,720
This level.

5916
03:14:28,540 --> 03:14:29,100
...

5917
03:14:31,680 --> 03:14:32,240
This...

5918
03:14:32,940 --> 03:14:34,520
Why is it so big?

5919
03:14:34,820 --> 03:14:35,260
...

5920
03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:40,160
I do kind of like the...

5921
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:41,940
The direction...

5922
03:14:41,940 --> 03:14:44,440
This direction.

5923
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:46,640
If I don't make it a Wobbuffet...

5924
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:47,220
...

5925
03:14:47,220 --> 03:14:49,740
I think it could be kind of cute.

5926
03:14:50,040 --> 03:14:51,160
Hold on...

5927
03:14:51,160 --> 03:14:52,580
There's some that are like this.

5928
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:54,200
...

5929
03:14:55,360 --> 03:14:57,020
Maybe like a...

5930
03:14:58,040 --> 03:14:59,300
Maybe like a Miffy face.

5931
03:15:00,400 --> 03:15:01,000
Miffy!

5932
03:15:01,880 --> 03:15:03,340
I love Miffy.

5933
03:15:03,340 --> 03:15:03,840
...

5934
03:15:03,840 --> 03:15:04,120
...

5935
03:15:10,410 --> 03:15:11,490
Give it...

5936
03:15:12,150 --> 03:15:12,550
Sleeves?

5937
03:15:12,550 --> 03:15:12,930
Arms?

5938
03:15:13,470 --> 03:15:14,870
I don't think that'll work.

5939
03:15:15,470 --> 03:15:17,910
I think it makes it look so ugly.

5940
03:15:18,270 --> 03:15:18,710
...

5941
03:15:18,710 --> 03:15:19,550
...

5942
03:15:21,070 --> 03:15:21,710
...

5943
03:15:22,890 --> 03:15:24,790
I think it makes it look ugly.

5944
03:15:25,110 --> 03:15:26,070
That's okay, though.

5945
03:15:27,030 --> 03:15:27,670
...

5946
03:15:28,990 --> 03:15:29,630
...

5947
03:15:31,990 --> 03:15:34,610
Every time you say Minto, it sounds like Mentos.

5948
03:15:34,610 --> 03:15:35,190
...

5949
03:15:36,150 --> 03:15:37,430
Let's see this one.

5950
03:15:37,770 --> 03:15:39,090
...

5951
03:15:43,920 --> 03:15:45,320
...

5952
03:15:45,780 --> 03:15:46,440
...

5953
03:15:49,940 --> 03:15:51,260
...

5954
03:15:51,260 --> 03:15:51,640
...

5955
03:15:51,640 --> 03:15:51,700
...

5956
03:15:54,460 --> 03:15:55,780
...

5957
03:15:55,780 --> 03:15:56,460
...

5958
03:16:14,620 --> 03:16:15,220
...

5959
03:16:24,080 --> 03:16:24,680
...

5960
03:16:24,680 --> 03:16:26,140
Wait, that's actually not so bad!

5961
03:16:26,600 --> 03:16:26,920
...

5962
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:30,260
With the little tongue out!

5963
03:16:30,760 --> 03:16:31,360
...

5964
03:16:31,360 --> 03:16:32,460
Like me!

5965
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:33,020
Like me!

5966
03:16:35,400 --> 03:16:36,000
...

5967
03:16:37,060 --> 03:16:37,660
...

5968
03:16:37,660 --> 03:16:38,040
...

5969
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:38,380
...

5970
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:40,600
...

5971
03:16:51,850 --> 03:16:52,930
We're onto something.

5972
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:54,210
We're onto something.

5973
03:16:54,210 --> 03:16:54,930
We're onto something.

5974
03:16:55,110 --> 03:16:55,590
We're onto something.

5975
03:16:56,290 --> 03:17:01,570
And then I could add like some...

5976
03:17:03,370 --> 03:17:03,890
...

5977
03:17:13,460 --> 03:17:13,980
...

5978
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:15,760
...

5979
03:17:15,760 --> 03:17:15,920
...

5980
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:22,340
I would put like little sparklies maybe.

5981
03:17:23,460 --> 03:17:23,980
...

5982
03:17:24,380 --> 03:17:24,640
...

5983
03:17:28,340 --> 03:17:30,360
I think it would look better if it's like...

5984
03:17:30,360 --> 03:17:34,720
You know how like in Idolmaster when they show their signatures they're like all sparkly...

5985
03:17:34,720 --> 03:17:38,700
They're glowing and they're all sparkly in the eyes.

5986
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:40,040
Make it look like Gengar.

5987
03:17:40,340 --> 03:17:40,560
...

5988
03:17:43,080 --> 03:17:44,180
Maybe it would look...

5989
03:17:44,180 --> 03:17:46,620
I mean also it's drawn on my...

5990
03:17:46,620 --> 03:17:48,680
With my mouse, so...

5991
03:17:49,940 --> 03:17:50,900
We're workshopping it.

5992
03:17:52,280 --> 03:17:53,200
It's my signature.

5993
03:17:53,380 --> 03:17:54,100
You don't have to like it.

5994
03:17:54,420 --> 03:17:59,100
Except people who are getting it on a postcard and have to look at it every time you see it.

5995
03:17:59,400 --> 03:18:03,620
You're gonna look at this guy's little face and you're gonna be like, oh no.

5996
03:18:04,460 --> 03:18:05,280
Oh no.

5997
03:18:06,320 --> 03:18:06,440
...

5998
03:18:07,960 --> 03:18:08,480
...

5999
03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:10,120
...

6000
03:18:12,720 --> 03:18:14,280
Idolmaster signatures are nice.

6001
03:18:14,400 --> 03:18:15,600
Yeah, that's what I'm looking at.

6002
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:18,440
I'm looking at just like idol signatures in general.

6003
03:18:18,960 --> 03:18:20,300
For inspiration.

6004
03:18:21,100 --> 03:18:21,620
...

6005
03:18:22,480 --> 03:18:23,500
But some of...

6006
03:18:23,500 --> 03:18:26,400
Most of them are like so complex because they do...

6007
03:18:26,400 --> 03:18:26,660
...

6008
03:18:26,660 --> 03:18:28,740
They do like a lot...

6009
03:18:28,740 --> 03:18:32,820
They have like the kanji incorporated and things like that.

6010
03:18:33,100 --> 03:18:37,040
And then it's easier I feel like with hiragana because it's so...

6011
03:18:37,040 --> 03:18:38,520
It's so loopy.

6012
03:18:39,640 --> 03:18:40,200
...

6013
03:18:40,600 --> 03:18:40,880
...

6014
03:18:42,580 --> 03:18:43,140
...

6015
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:45,680
Like a...

6016
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:48,160
Like if I did...

6017
03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:50,700
Like if I did the minto in...

6018
03:18:50,700 --> 03:18:51,580
Like a...

6019
03:18:51,580 --> 03:18:52,960
Wrong way.

6020
03:18:53,180 --> 03:18:55,260
Something like that.

6021
03:18:55,700 --> 03:18:57,660
And then you have like this.

6022
03:18:59,080 --> 03:18:59,720
And then you have like this.

6023
03:19:00,440 --> 03:19:01,700
And like...

6024
03:19:01,700 --> 03:19:02,600
You know...

6025
03:19:02,600 --> 03:19:04,320
Or here...

6026
03:19:04,320 --> 03:19:06,260
And then like that for the toe.

6027
03:19:06,700 --> 03:19:08,580
They're always so crazy, you know?

6028
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:13,700
And then...

6029
03:19:13,700 --> 03:19:14,880
And then when you do it...

6030
03:19:15,920 --> 03:19:17,200
Like that...

6031
03:19:17,860 --> 03:19:20,660
And then it has like a face in here...

6032
03:19:20,660 --> 03:19:22,580
Like a...

6033
03:19:22,580 --> 03:19:22,760
...

6034
03:19:24,080 --> 03:19:25,180
Kind of like that.

6035
03:19:25,180 --> 03:19:27,780
Like they always go so crazy with them.

6036
03:19:29,240 --> 03:19:29,900
...

6037
03:19:29,900 --> 03:19:30,860
The face is essential.

6038
03:19:31,180 --> 03:19:32,220
For my branding.

6039
03:19:32,980 --> 03:19:33,640
...

6040
03:19:33,640 --> 03:19:37,160
Can't you try to write mint normally as your signature?

6041
03:19:37,340 --> 03:19:37,880
No!

6042
03:19:38,300 --> 03:19:38,880
...

6043
03:19:43,340 --> 03:19:44,000
No.

6044
03:19:45,290 --> 03:19:46,720
Must be perfect from the beginning.

6045
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:48,500
...

6046
03:19:49,820 --> 03:19:52,080
It can't just be my ugly handwriting.

6047
03:19:52,960 --> 03:19:53,620
...

6048
03:19:58,740 --> 03:20:00,440
It has to be special.

6049
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:01,160
...

6050
03:20:01,160 --> 03:20:01,220
...

6051
03:20:09,390 --> 03:20:12,510
Can we make custom mint signatures in your art tag?

6052
03:20:12,670 --> 03:20:12,850
...

6053
03:20:12,850 --> 03:20:12,870
Can we make custom mint signatures in your art tag?

6054
03:20:12,870 --> 03:20:13,150
You can!

6055
03:20:13,330 --> 03:20:15,510
But I prefer to make my own.

6056
03:20:17,210 --> 03:20:17,610
So...

6057
03:20:18,130 --> 03:20:20,290
If you do, I will not use it.

6058
03:20:20,310 --> 03:20:21,710
I can tell you that now.

6059
03:20:21,830 --> 03:20:22,670
But I appreciate it.

6060
03:20:23,070 --> 03:20:23,870
I just can't.

6061
03:20:23,890 --> 03:20:24,650
I won't use it.

6062
03:20:24,890 --> 03:20:28,190
Because I prefer to come up with it on my own.

6063
03:20:29,690 --> 03:20:30,090
...

6064
03:20:32,820 --> 03:20:34,960
I have to add a doodle for Pizazz.

6065
03:20:35,720 --> 03:20:37,480
That's what the ghost is for.

6066
03:20:37,960 --> 03:20:38,500
...

6067
03:20:39,920 --> 03:20:41,920
I think I will go with...

6068
03:20:41,920 --> 03:20:43,280
I will start with this.

6069
03:20:43,380 --> 03:20:44,300
It kind of looks like Funashi.

6070
03:20:47,980 --> 03:20:48,520
...

6071
03:20:49,300 --> 03:20:49,840
...

6072
03:20:51,280 --> 03:20:52,800
Minto with Papyrus.

6073
03:20:52,960 --> 03:20:53,280
...

6074
03:20:55,400 --> 03:20:57,760
Have you ever filled out the document?

6075
03:20:57,980 --> 03:20:58,960
The documents you signed?

6076
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:01,320
... Instead of drawing a signature?

6077
03:21:01,740 --> 03:21:03,500
You can type your signature.

6078
03:21:03,920 --> 03:21:05,740
And it counts as your signature.

6079
03:21:06,300 --> 03:21:06,960
...

6080
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:09,360
It's me with the...

6081
03:21:09,360 --> 03:21:10,260
...

6082
03:21:11,420 --> 03:21:12,860
Me with the...

6083
03:21:12,860 --> 03:21:13,280
...

6084
03:21:15,620 --> 03:21:16,280
Papyrus.

6085
03:21:16,400 --> 03:21:17,040
...

6086
03:21:19,360 --> 03:21:23,740
If I were to write mint, I would have to be done so...

6087
03:21:25,500 --> 03:21:27,040
Here's an example.

6088
03:21:28,160 --> 03:21:30,220
It's so hard with these ones.

6089
03:21:30,500 --> 03:21:30,840
...

6090
03:21:31,740 --> 03:21:33,520
A lot of them are their kanji.

6091
03:21:34,380 --> 03:21:36,120
But just to give you an idea.

6092
03:21:36,420 --> 03:21:38,440
Let's see if there's some Idolmaster ones.

6093
03:21:39,260 --> 03:21:39,440
...

6094
03:21:39,440 --> 03:21:40,760
Riamo's is so cute.

6095
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:42,920
So cute.

6096
03:21:43,260 --> 03:21:44,940
Oh my, she's also got that little eyes in it.

6097
03:21:45,240 --> 03:21:46,100
That's so funny.

6098
03:21:51,080 --> 03:21:51,600
Then...

6099
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:52,020
Here.

6100
03:21:53,540 --> 03:21:55,280
Mine fits right in, you guys.

6101
03:21:55,800 --> 03:21:56,320
...

6102
03:21:57,380 --> 03:21:58,320
It's like...

6103
03:21:58,320 --> 03:21:59,320
It's like...

6104
03:21:59,320 --> 03:22:02,180
It just fits perfectly right in there.

6105
03:22:02,280 --> 03:22:02,680
Oh my gosh.

6106
03:22:02,900 --> 03:22:03,760
Huey!

6107
03:22:04,060 --> 03:22:04,720
...

6108
03:22:06,660 --> 03:22:09,500
Oh my gosh, Huey.

6109
03:22:09,540 --> 03:22:11,480
Thank you for the 50.

6110
03:22:12,020 --> 03:22:12,460
...

6111
03:22:13,860 --> 03:22:14,740
...

6112
03:22:14,740 --> 03:22:15,880
...

6113
03:22:15,880 --> 03:22:17,160
...

6114
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:21,540
I like the really...

6115
03:22:22,320 --> 03:22:22,960
Like...

6116
03:22:24,600 --> 03:22:26,300
The really...

6117
03:22:26,300 --> 03:22:27,820
Maybe if I...

6118
03:22:28,320 --> 03:22:28,620
Oh...

6119
03:22:30,380 --> 03:22:31,800
I don't know.

6120
03:22:32,300 --> 03:22:32,800
...

6121
03:22:35,220 --> 03:22:36,100
I don't know.

6122
03:22:36,220 --> 03:22:37,580
I'll figure it out.

6123
03:22:37,860 --> 03:22:38,200
...

6124
03:22:39,740 --> 03:22:40,840
I'll figure it out.

6125
03:22:41,240 --> 03:22:42,960
You should be on this boat.

6126
03:22:45,420 --> 03:22:47,300
Itsumine Yuika's signature is the best.

6127
03:22:47,420 --> 03:22:48,140
Wait, which one is that one?

6128
03:22:48,960 --> 03:22:49,460
...

6129
03:22:49,460 --> 03:22:50,140
...

6130
03:22:51,580 --> 03:22:52,080
...

6131
03:22:55,580 --> 03:22:55,980
Oh.

6132
03:22:56,640 --> 03:22:57,540
Oh wait, there it is.

6133
03:22:58,060 --> 03:22:58,140
...

6134
03:22:59,320 --> 03:23:00,000
Wait, is it?

6135
03:23:01,220 --> 03:23:02,080
It's so cute.

6136
03:23:02,340 --> 03:23:02,700
Oh wait!

6137
03:23:02,920 --> 03:23:03,780
It has the hat!

6138
03:23:04,040 --> 03:23:05,320
Oh my gosh, that's so cute.

6139
03:23:05,980 --> 03:23:06,380
...

6140
03:23:07,660 --> 03:23:08,620
That's so cute.

6141
03:23:09,900 --> 03:23:10,300
...

6142
03:23:11,720 --> 03:23:12,980
I'll show you guys too.

6143
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:14,420
...

6144
03:23:20,450 --> 03:23:21,410
Like, look at that.

6145
03:23:21,570 --> 03:23:22,410
They're so crazy.

6146
03:23:22,770 --> 03:23:23,170
...

6147
03:23:23,170 --> 03:23:26,950
But, and then of course the kanji always like makes it so much more...

6148
03:23:26,950 --> 03:23:32,950
See, that's why I was like, oh, you know, I can do like stars or whatever in it, little circles.

6149
03:23:33,510 --> 03:23:35,530
Make, just dress it up a little bit.

6150
03:23:35,770 --> 03:23:39,910
I love, I love circular autographs.

6151
03:23:39,910 --> 03:23:42,770
Maybe because they look so, um...

6152
03:23:43,450 --> 03:23:47,250
Maybe because they look so nice on Shikishi.

6153
03:23:47,610 --> 03:23:47,990
...

6154
03:23:49,890 --> 03:23:52,890
But like, you know, this, this, the...

6155
03:23:53,170 --> 03:23:56,210
the busyness like just shows up so well.

6156
03:23:58,210 --> 03:23:59,370
Circu... Yeah, like a stamp!

6157
03:23:59,670 --> 03:24:00,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

6158
03:24:00,430 --> 03:24:01,890
It is very aesthetically pleasing.

6159
03:24:02,410 --> 03:24:04,710
But with my name, I don't really have any circles.

6160
03:24:04,850 --> 03:24:09,530
Which is why I would have to make the mint, or the M like the biggest circular part maybe.

6161
03:24:09,670 --> 03:24:13,090
Unless I like circled my name and wrote, wrote it on the inside.

6162
03:24:13,390 --> 03:24:13,750
But...

6163
03:24:14,250 --> 03:24:14,650
...

6164
03:24:17,530 --> 03:24:19,150
Is there a kanji for mint?

6165
03:24:19,510 --> 03:24:20,410
Maybe, but...

6166
03:24:21,970 --> 03:24:24,730
But, you could do minto and have the O go all around.

6167
03:24:25,230 --> 03:24:27,210
Oh, you're cooking?

6168
03:24:28,270 --> 03:24:29,350
You're cooking?

6169
03:24:30,170 --> 03:24:30,430
...

6170
03:24:31,350 --> 03:24:31,970
...

6171
03:24:33,570 --> 03:24:34,810
So like...

6172
03:24:34,810 --> 03:24:35,090
...

6173
03:24:37,110 --> 03:24:41,150
I do like having it like a butt M too.

6174
03:24:41,410 --> 03:24:42,270
Wait, oh no.

6175
03:24:42,850 --> 03:24:43,470
...

6176
03:24:45,390 --> 03:24:46,010
Min...

6177
03:24:46,010 --> 03:24:47,690
... to.

6178
03:24:48,190 --> 03:24:48,810
...

6179
03:24:50,110 --> 03:24:50,950
Um...

6180
03:24:50,950 --> 03:24:51,390
...

6181
03:24:51,390 --> 03:24:53,650
Thank you for the thank you, thank you!

6182
03:24:55,350 --> 03:24:56,190
Um...

6183
03:24:57,310 --> 03:24:58,150
Um...

6184
03:25:02,770 --> 03:25:03,750
Min... to!

6185
03:25:05,030 --> 03:25:06,230
Why can't I?

6186
03:25:06,450 --> 03:25:07,290
Min...

6187
03:25:07,290 --> 03:25:09,050
... to!

6188
03:25:10,330 --> 03:25:10,350
...

6189
03:25:12,750 --> 03:25:14,990
Just looks like I circled my name.

6190
03:25:16,050 --> 03:25:16,890
...

6191
03:25:16,890 --> 03:25:18,270
...

6192
03:25:18,270 --> 03:25:19,090
...

6193
03:25:31,980 --> 03:25:33,260
This is hard.

6194
03:25:36,740 --> 03:25:37,200
Well...

6195
03:25:37,200 --> 03:25:40,020
Whatever I come up with, you guys will see.

6196
03:25:40,340 --> 03:25:40,800
...

6197
03:25:40,800 --> 03:25:44,060
On the postcards.

6198
03:25:44,220 --> 03:25:44,560
...

6199
03:25:45,300 --> 03:25:46,080
I suppose.

6200
03:25:47,860 --> 03:25:48,940
You guys will see.

6201
03:25:49,980 --> 03:25:51,340
On the postcards.

6202
03:25:52,080 --> 03:25:52,540
...

6203
03:25:53,700 --> 03:25:54,620
I think...

6204
03:25:54,620 --> 03:25:55,960
Oh my gosh, it's already 10.30.

6205
03:25:56,800 --> 03:25:58,300
I think I'm gonna head to bed.

6206
03:25:58,900 --> 03:26:00,740
I think I'm going to head out.

6207
03:26:00,740 --> 03:26:03,760
Tomorrow, I have a tomodachi live.

6208
03:26:04,300 --> 03:26:04,900
...

6209
03:26:04,900 --> 03:26:06,180
Tomodachi live.

6210
03:26:06,500 --> 03:26:06,800
...

6211
03:26:08,600 --> 03:26:11,900
Yeah, we'll create some crazy situations.

6212
03:26:12,340 --> 03:26:12,740
...

6213
03:26:12,740 --> 03:26:13,520
Hopefully.

6214
03:26:14,500 --> 03:26:14,800
...

6215
03:26:14,800 --> 03:26:18,160
Last time I played, none of my people got married.

6216
03:26:18,340 --> 03:26:19,380
So that's the goal.

6217
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:23,100
I wonder what's the most cursed pairing we can get.

6218
03:26:23,600 --> 03:26:24,200
...

6219
03:26:25,080 --> 03:26:25,980
I wonder.

6220
03:26:26,500 --> 03:26:27,100
...

6221
03:26:28,480 --> 03:26:29,380
Yes, yes, yes.

6222
03:26:30,740 --> 03:26:31,340
Thank you!

6223
03:26:32,660 --> 03:26:35,060
Thank you guys for enjoying this.

6224
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:36,040
Well, maybe enjoying.

6225
03:26:36,780 --> 03:26:37,300
For...

6226
03:26:37,300 --> 03:26:37,840
...

6227
03:26:39,260 --> 03:26:43,540
Hanging out with me and participating in this cursed game.

6228
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:44,120
...

6229
03:26:44,920 --> 03:26:46,040
Fassad was so silly.

6230
03:26:46,500 --> 03:26:47,720
It's free, by the way.

6231
03:26:47,800 --> 03:26:49,760
If you ever want to try it out yourself.

6232
03:26:50,020 --> 03:26:51,380
Just google it.

6233
03:26:51,460 --> 03:26:52,960
You can download it for free.

6234
03:26:54,180 --> 03:26:56,160
It is free.

6235
03:26:56,360 --> 03:26:58,320
You can do it however.

6236
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:00,200
You can be like...

6237
03:27:00,740 --> 03:27:02,160
trying to get the most cursed combination ever.

6238
03:27:02,980 --> 03:27:03,400
...

6239
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:04,260
Um.

6240
03:27:05,700 --> 03:27:07,580
From divorced, to trying to get married.

6241
03:27:07,720 --> 03:27:08,080
Oh my gosh!

6242
03:27:08,100 --> 03:27:10,260
We should make them in...

6243
03:27:10,260 --> 03:27:12,320
in tomodachi live!

6244
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:13,460
...

6245
03:27:14,540 --> 03:27:14,960
Oh.

6246
03:27:16,220 --> 03:27:16,960
Hey Mint.

6247
03:27:17,060 --> 03:27:17,800
It's me piccolo.

6248
03:27:17,960 --> 03:27:19,960
Did you know your initials are MF?

6249
03:27:20,080 --> 03:27:20,260
...

6250
03:27:23,020 --> 03:27:23,860
Thanks Piccolo.

6251
03:27:24,280 --> 03:27:24,700
...

6252
03:27:26,320 --> 03:27:27,460
What you just call me?

6253
03:27:33,240 --> 03:27:37,460
Thank you guys for hanging out with me until the very end.

6254
03:27:37,660 --> 03:27:39,200
Really really appreciate it.

6255
03:27:42,600 --> 03:27:46,140
I guess I'll see you guys later.

6256
03:27:49,020 --> 03:27:50,380
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

6257
03:27:57,460 --> 03:27:57,800
Otsu... Oh!

6258
03:28:00,400 --> 03:28:02,600
Play... Play... Play me out!

6259
03:28:02,880 --> 03:28:03,600
Play me out!

6260
03:28:04,380 --> 03:28:05,380
Play me out!

6261
03:28:05,480 --> 03:28:06,180
Play me out!

6262
03:28:06,200 --> 03:28:07,720
Play me... Play me out!

6263
03:28:07,940 --> 03:28:08,660
Play me out!

6264
03:28:08,700 --> 03:28:09,220
Play me out!

6265
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:15,660
Play me out!

6266
03:28:16,020 --> 03:28:16,980
Thanks for the pink!

6267
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:22,580
Since we have the Bustin' emote now...

6268
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:25,160
We can... You can use it.

6269
03:28:25,240 --> 03:28:26,340
You can use the Bustin'...

6270
03:28:26,340 --> 03:28:27,260

6271
03:28:29,180 --> 03:28:29,940
OtsuMito!

6272
03:28:34,140 --> 03:28:36,460
If there's something strange...

6273
03:28:37,040 --> 03:28:38,880
Sleeping in your bed...

6274
03:28:38,880 --> 03:28:42,580
Let me tell you something...

6275
03:28:44,180 --> 03:28:45,180
You can hear it, right?

6276
03:28:46,100 --> 03:28:46,640
Okay, yeah.

6277
03:28:47,360 --> 03:28:49,560
Let me tell you something...

6278
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:51,960
Bustin' makes me feel good!

6279
03:28:51,960 --> 03:28:52,540
garment

6280
03:29:16,740 --> 03:29:18,480
Thanks for...

Feel good, feel good, feel good!

Freaky Ghost Maid!

6284
03:30:13,870 --> 03:30:16,070
Freaky Masked Man!

6285
03:30:18,050 --> 03:30:20,190
Freaky McMahon Baby!

6286
03:30:20,590 --> 03:30:22,010
Why can't I remember?

6287
03:30:26,110 --> 03:30:27,390
Let me sleep in your bed!

6288
03:30:30,850 --> 03:30:32,550

6289
03:30:40,070 --> 03:30:42,710

Drink water, everybody!

6296
03:31:14,150 --> 03:31:16,130

03:31:35,370 --> 03:31:37,610
You guys have been absolutely insane.

6305
03:31:38,330 --> 03:31:40,050
I'm a little overwhelmed.

6306
03:31:40,370 --> 03:31:42,310
Now I'm reevaluating...

6307
03:31:42,310 --> 03:31:42,850
Oh my god!

6308
03:31:43,150 --> 03:31:44,170

Oh, it just went to the next song.

6326
03:32:11,270 --> 03:32:11,450
Sorry.

6327
03:32:11,990 --> 03:32:12,390
