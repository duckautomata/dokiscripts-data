00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:45,020
Come a little bit closer Hear what I have to say

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:01,300
Just like children we sleep in We could dream this night away

3
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:18,330
But there's a full moon rising Let's go dancing in the light

4
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:37,860
We know where the music's playing Let's go out and feel the light Because

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:02:04,700
I'm still in love with you I wanna see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon When

6
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:28,920
we were strangers I watched you from afar But

7
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,940
now it's getting late And the moon is climbing high

8
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:19,930
I want to celebrate See it shining in your eyes

9
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:44,520
Because I'm still in love with you I wanna see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon

10
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:52,610
Because I'm still in love with you dance again because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon
