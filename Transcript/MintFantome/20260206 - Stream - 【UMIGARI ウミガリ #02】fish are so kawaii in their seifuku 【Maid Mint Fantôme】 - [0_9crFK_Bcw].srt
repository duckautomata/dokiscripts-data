1
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,860
Why did I have a river bond?

2
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,660
Why my boo?

3
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,500
Thank you so much.

4
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,680
Hello.

5
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm the one getting spooked here.

6
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm the one getting spooked here.

7
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,460
Tadaima!

8
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,200
Oh, Kairi!

9
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,540
Wait a second.

10
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,060
I need to put on something.

11
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,340
Oh.

12
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,580
I got like a soap.

13
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,480
It so dries my hands.

14
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,940
I must revitalize the ectoplasm.

15
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,800
Got my ticket ready.

16
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,880
Can't wait to see your concert.

17
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
Thank you.

18
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,880
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

19
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,820
Yeah, it was next week.

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,220

Oh, next week.

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,060
Oh, it's my 3D Jazz live show.

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,520

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320

Hi, Minto.

41
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,140
I'm old again.

42
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:33,180
Might have requested MGS-style birthday song, Deco-Less,
while I watch the snowfall in Ohio.

43
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,380
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

44
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,820
Happy birthday.

45
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,200
Wait.

46
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,180
How does it go again?

47
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,980
Wait.

48
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,700
Why am I blanking out?

49
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,460
I'm having to remember so many things.

50
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
I can't even remember this.

51
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,340
MGS.

52
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,480
Birthday song.

53
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,740
Why can't I remember?

54
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,840
I have to look it up.

55
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,060
I have to look it up.

56
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,040
I can't even remember.

57
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,900
Okay, I remember.

58
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,940
Okay, I remember.

59
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,440
My brain is... The brain fog is so real.

60
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,280
Yesterday, I was like, you know what?

61
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:28,640
I've been haunting pretty late hours recently, so I'm
gonna... I'm gonna hit the It was around 10 p.m., 11 p.m.,

62
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,380
and I was like, oh my gosh, I forgot to do this thing, and
so I was up until 3 a.m.

63
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,960
Just trying to fix, trying to finish it.

64
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,160
Ah!

65
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,880
Ah!

66
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,740
My brain actually feels like it's gonna explode recently.

67
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,520
So I'm really sorry if I'm like extra brain foggy.

68
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,320
Anyways, Nicholas, it's your birthday.

69
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:07,160
Happy birthday, congratulations, happy birthday, we're
salutations, happy birthday, may your sky stay blue, happy

70
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,940
birthday to you, woo, happy birthday.

71
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah, and I have a double stream today, crazy, accidental
double stream, but that's okay, because I was really

72
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,280
enjoying this game.

73
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,300
So, yes, we will finish Ubigari today.

74
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,240
And we will catch those fish.

75
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,680
Catch those fish.

76
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,580
Catch those.

77
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,080
I was trying to figure out what I want to stream next week.

78
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,120
Because, you know, it's going to be a bit of a shorter week
since I will have the jazz show.

79
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,520
And I'm like, do I, since I'm, you know, I'm going to be
done with Alan Wake.

80
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:01,380
series part of me was like maybe Bioshock uncharted I don't
know it's my birthday too but only one to thank you and

81
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:14,680
thanks for everything this spot this spiral thank you happy
birthday happy birthday high tail yeah I could do some high

82
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:30,500
tail next week so Bioshock would be be so good right now
honestly i was not planning on having a second stream today

83
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:38,980
so i was going to play more of portal 2 and it's kind of all
i can think about i just want to play more portal 2 halo

84
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,840
thank you so much for the vibe get that thank you yeah maybe
bioshock would be fun to start i could probably finish it

85
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,660
before i go on my longer trip so that i can get it out of
the way i also have to plan for some like streams and games

86
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,680
that i can play while I'm away on my travel setup, so...

87
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,780
Maybe like a...

88
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,940
Like a...

89
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,620
Maybe I can bring my Switch.

90
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,320
Play some Switch games.

91
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,780
Since that won't take any computing...

92
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,960
Computing power.

93
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,720
Return of the Obradin?

94
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,880
I've played that one before.

95
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,600
Yes, yes.

96
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,530
Though...

97
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,760
I've played it!

98
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:29,740
But if you told me to do all of the puzzles once again, like
the connections of who goes where and what and how I

99
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:40,440
probably would not be able to tell you thank you thank you
nothing like spooky fishing to finish up a workday oh two

100
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:51,040
have you ever played half-life wait I can't tell if this is
a joke or not wait

101
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,280
When are you going to play MGSV?

102
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,180
Just curious, since I heard the birthday song.

103
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:07,560
Well, since it's such a long undertaking, I'm still figuring
out when I would have time to play it.

104
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,140
You know what I mean?

105
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,620
Because it would suck if I started it and then had to wait,
like, weeks in between each time I could play it.

106
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,220
I mean, I have played it before, so it's not like I'm
missing out.

107
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,160
But I do still want it on my channel.

108
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,260
I like to have games sometimes.

109
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,100
on my channel.

110
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,940
Maybe I've played them before.

111
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
Somewhere distant.

112
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,000
Other worldly places.

113
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:41,260
But I like to think of my own channel as kind of like my own
resume in a sense.

114
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,420
My resume, my catalog of things that I've done.

115
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,420
Oh, wait.

116
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,700
Oh, wait.

117
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,160
Never mind.

118
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,320
You already played Halfway.

119
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,420
I did.

120
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,880
I did!

121
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,660
Yeah!

122
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,820
And two!

123
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,700
Yeah.

124
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,440
An archive.

125
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,600
Yes, my archive.

126
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,220
Yes, yes.

127
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,340
So sometimes I do like replaying things just so that I can
have them on my channel.

128
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,960
If that's the case, I'm gonna get fired.

129
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,580
Wait, what do you mean?

130
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,800
Why are you getting fired?

131
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,300
When are you playing Half-Life 3?

132
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,060
I'm marching to the...

133
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,900
I'm marching to the...

134
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,080
Studios right now.

135
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,120
I...

136
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,820
Okay, I mentioned this in my Portal 2 playthrough.

137
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,260
But like...

138
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,960
Can you guys imagine a Valve-themed amusement park?

139
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
Like a Valve-themed park?

140
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,420
Oh my gosh.

141
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,840
Wouldn't it have been so awesome?

142
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,740
I've been thinking about it so much recently.

143
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:07,140
be so good except except um oh my gosh what is the place in
half-life that they're like we don't talk about this place

144
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:15,580
but we don't we don't want you we don't want to go there
yeah i had crab hats for 20 i know it would be i mean they

145
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:23,440
have honestly i feel like they have enough yeah ravenholm
ravenholm i feel like they have enough properties to like

146
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,320
make fun sections.

147
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,560
Like, you have, like, a Half-Life section, and then you have
the Team Fortress section, and then you have the Portal

148
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,200
section.

149
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,100
What else do that?

150
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,540
What else?

151
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,000
Left 4 Dead!

152
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,500
A lot of zombies.

153
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,740
Does that mean Super Mario 64 again?

154
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,800
Oh, no!

155
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,600
Oh, wait.

156
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,220
Maybe we don't want a Team Park.

157
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,600
Okay.

158
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:05,700
but i feel like i feel like you know we have obviously we
have like the mario world but i feel like video game

159
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:17,900
inspired amusement parks is such like an untapped market and
maybe maybe you could argue i would say even 10 years ago

160
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:24,200
especially 20 years ago even 10 years ago though sorry i
just realized the rate was like so long maybe you could

161
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:34,280
argue that like gaming was not like huge enough to to really
garner that kind of market but i feel like it's just i don't

162
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,080
know even

163
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:49,730
now i think that quote-unquote gamers are not taken very
seriously i think it's because so many people are silly

164
00:15:49,730 --> 00:16:00,110
online i think gamers aren't taken very seriously so
probably it would take much more to be convincing Final

165
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,830
Fantasy could carry a theme park, I bet.

166
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,830
Right, like a square-themed theme park or something.

167
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,850
I don't know why I keep saying theme-themed.

168
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,710
But, seeing as enough time has passed since this was last
asked, I think I can ask this now.

169
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,410
Minto, may I have your permission to get another Aibu slash
Aibus pregnant?

170
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,050
What?

171
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,550
When?

172
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,530
Okay, why is it that it...

173
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,510
Why is it that the amount of time needs to be passed?

174
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,110
that why do you feel like you need to

175
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:51,050
like why is why is that the determining factor and not just
the content of the question itself and also is the other

176
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:59,630
party consenting to this all all I booze who are wanting...

177
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,630
Who are wanting...

178
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,630
To become...

179
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,230
Parents, raise your hand.

180
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,470
Um...

181
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,740
I had a weird stress headache earlier today.

182
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
I had a nap and it passed now.

183
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,500
Oh, good, good.

184
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,160
So I didn't feel like cooking at dinner time.

185
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,460
But now I'm getting hangry!

186
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,720
Could you recommend something yummy to order?

187
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,220
I had... I had a burger for lunch.

188
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,960
hamburger

189
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,120
there's like a have you guys heard that like sound that's
used in videos sometimes I think it's the guy that made the

190
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:03,340
let's go gambling sound and he made one that's just like
nothing ever is gonna make me happy in this world I can't be

191
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:12,480
happy and then it interrupts with hamburger that might be
mean hamburger

192
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:29,800
Rad X flip note It's funny because like I feel like it's so
millennial humor But sometimes it's fine to have like Gringy

193
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:42,300
fun Whimsy humor Hamburger It's so like Can I has
cheeseburger coated Maybe we are reverting back to The

194
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,180
golden texts Yeah

195
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,440
Somebody should buy an abandoned oil rig and make a mother
base theme park.

196
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,560
I have been saying this since I died.

197
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,340
I have been saying this forever.

198
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,620
I said this before I even played Metal Gear.

199
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,820
I just knew that I would love Metal Gear and I was like, you
know what, someone should do that.

200
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,560
And I'm like, why would I say that?

201
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,660
Who's possessing me?

202
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,040
Hi, hi, totally off topic.

203
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,600
Sorry, no, but I'm decoing your photo cards.

204
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,460
Who's your favorite Sanrio character?

205
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,720
Okay, I have two.

206
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,380
Recently, okay, I used to be like the biggest cinema.

207
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,140
Well, not, I don't want to say used to be.

208
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,240
I still love cinema roll.

209
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,880
But cinema roll was my number one for a super duper long
time.

210
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,380
And then, and then.

211
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,620
Hanamaru Obagehi, don't kill.

212
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,220
I love Hanamaru.

213
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,980
Hanamaru Obake is my favorite.

214
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,420
But it's kind of hard to find.

215
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,620
Well, there's lots of merch of them, but it's also like...

216
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,220
Obviously, Cinemarle is like way more popular.

217
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,400
We don't have hands to raise, Minky.

218
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,260
And honestly, I feel like Hanamaru makes more sense for me.

219
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,560
Because he's like, oh, listen.

220
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,860
So am I.

221
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,340
We are kindred spirits.

222
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,160
Stop, I'm the same way it's both Cinemarle and Hanamaru.

223
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,780
Yeah!

224
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,120
They're too good!

225
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,020
My only thing is I love with Cinemarol is like how much blue
like light blues.

226
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,520
You guys, actually light blue is my favorite color.

227
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,140
My name is Mint, but light blue is my favorite color.

228
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,960
And Cinemarol has so much good light blue.

229
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
Light blue coloring.

230
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,380
And the only thing about Hanemaru is he's always paired with
red.

231
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,340
So...

232
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:50,850
Scandal.

233
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,610
No!

234
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,870
I can't help how I died.

235
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,880
I can't help it.

236
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
I can't help it.

237
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,540
Mid turquoise.

238
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,800
That's why you find that my mint coloring is a little more
on the bluish mint side than the greener mint side.

239
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,060
Ah, blue in my hair.

240
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,380
Yeah, little blue accents.

241
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, that's why.

242
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,520
Yeah.

243
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,040
I willed it.

244
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,640
Anyway, shall we continue the game?

245
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,860
Yes.

246
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,120
Oh, gosh.

247
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,020
Oh, I forgot that it puts us here.

248
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,440
Okay, so just...

249
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,300
Wow, big boy.

250
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,580
Head to station.

251
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,500
We are headed to a new area.

252
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,780
Uh...

253
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,060
Uh, this away, this away, this away.

254
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,640
And, uh, yeah.

255
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,900
Um, you died in a mint-related accident.

256
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:12,260
I got, I got, I got, I worked in a double mint factory, and
it exploded, and I got, I got suffocated, probably.

257
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,520
Taking a dappy tool, catch contradiction later, but I wanted
to thank you for helping me push through comms by activating

258
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,960
my neurons with every two-nine.

259
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,800
I'd have a good stream, Vicky.

260
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,880
Good night, Tuner!

261
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,360
Tuner.

262
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,980
Tuner.

263
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,740
Tuner.

264
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,800
One second.

265
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,240
There we go.

266
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,440
Okie dokie.

267
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,180
So, but I don't think...

268
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,760
I think we need probably speed level four for this.

269
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,180
So we must fish.

270
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,760
We must cash money.

271
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,420
Aha.

272
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,900
I think the game got an update or something, and they still
didn't fix this.

273
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,980
There's also an achievement for finding every bottle.

274
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,140
So I think we need to go back here to then go to the next
place, probably.

275
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,880
Still got it, baby.

276
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,220
Still got it.

277
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,960
Give me my 500 yen.

278
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,510
Let's see.

279
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:44,230
boat seat is boat speed okay we can do that we can do that

280
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:53,910

281
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,890

282
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,110
Oh gosh, I really am Disney-brained, maybe.

283
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,890
Was that something green in the water?

284
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,690
It's curious.

285
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,390
I'm at half fuel, but we're just gonna chill around here.

286
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,750
We're gonna chill as art around here.

287
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,750
And we have our new bait machine.

288
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,910
Get baited.

289
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,150
But the fish here are fast.

290
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,620
Go out a little bit more.

291
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,460
Here we go.

292
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,540
Alright, come on fish.

293
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,500
Someone I can use as a bait.

294
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,700
Someone I can use and grind up and turn into a meatball.

295
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,060
How does that happen?

296
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,120
Mint the master baiter.

297
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,060
Don't say that.

298
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,600
Hello?

299
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,680
Are there any fish?

300
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,400
Did I rob the sea?

301
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,280
Look, it says there's one, two, three, four.

302
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,320
Where are you?

303
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,800
Where are you?

304
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,140
Is that one right there?

305
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,120
I think

306
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,330
I got baited.

307
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,610
I think I got baited.

308
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,590
Where's the fish?

309
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,230
No!

310
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,090
Wait, is this place...

311
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,870
Okay, wait, I keep thinking that I'm in the place with the
flying fish, but no, this place does not have the flying

312
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,290
fish.

313
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,170
It has the inky fish.

314
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,270
Oh!

315
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,550
down there.

316
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,930
No, come on!

317
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,970
If I did upgrades, I wonder if I'd be able to get them.

318
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,930
There's two of them there.

319
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,450
Might need bait to lure them out first.

320
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,390
Yeah, but there's no fish to bait.

321
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,590
There's no fish to turn into bait.

322
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,510
Everything is gone.

323
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,030
My seas are barren.

324
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,470
What's happening?

325
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,870
I think those are indication that there's these guys
underneath.

326
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,270
You see how it's like kind of fuzzy?

327
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,960
The economy!

328
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,800
My fish economy!

329
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,640
Bait!

330
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,300
Bait!

331
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,720
I will have you yet, my sweet.

332
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,580
Are you gonna come back?

333
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,920
Ugh.

334
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,000
We gotta try again with this nasty guy.

335
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,630
They're still down there.

336
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,470
They're still down there.

337
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,350
I see them.

338
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,960
Let me throw, like, a little...

339
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,460
Yes.

340
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,880
Yes!

341
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,500
Okay, now any other guys coming over?

342
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,340
You.

343
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,820
Alright, we can get the other one now.

344
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,660
It's good.

345
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,420
You put down one bait and you start getting a ton of guys.

346
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,060
It's great.

347
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,860
Plenty of fish in the sea, my ass.

348
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,500
Where is everyone?

349
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,660
I know, right?

350
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,460
Like, I feel like I'm crazy right now.

351
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,140
Got him.

352
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,600
Holy cow.

353
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,500
I forgot how big these guys are.

354
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Wait, any others?

355
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,740
Any guys that I could get for bait?

356
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,760
Anybody?

357
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,980
Where are all the fish?

358
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,400
serious it was not this barren yesterday when i played

359
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,380
it was definitely not this barren yesterday when i played

360
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,920
i like to sell these guys pretty much immediately though
because at one i don't want them falling out and two oh i

361
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,440
think that's a guy Two, they take up so much space.

362
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,720
And let's, let's fuel up, too, before I forget.

363
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,100
Hoi!

364
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:42,980
Hoi!

365
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:44,940
Ha!

366
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,780
Shea!

367
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,820
Money, money, money, money, money.

368
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,160
How far can I go before I pass out?

369
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:13,820
I think it's really funny that there's no like uh no like
water breathing I guess because we were a fish do you think

370
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,280
that's why we there's no meter that says like hey you can
only breathe under the water for this amount of time because

371
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:31,300
we were a fish you think that is the case can I walk here or
am I going to pass out?

372
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:42,020
okay there's a guy there's a guy too I might just buy the
upgrade for my rod anyway not gonna lie

373
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:59,670
that and Chilla's game I think they just didn't care no no
they care they care surely there's some thought bomb I don't

374
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,390
mind it.

375
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:02,970
Surely.

376
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,910
It's so expensive, though.

377
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,060
I mean, we all are still fishes, but we no longer breathe
underwater.

378
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm a fish?

379
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,420
Call me a fish.

380
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Sorry.

381
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,090
Alright.

382
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,090
Oh, wait.

383
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:44,630
My bad.

384
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,250
You.

385
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,870
Get in there.

386
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,270
It's so horrible.

387
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,890
It's actually so disgusting.

388
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,750
There seem to be a handful of guys around this area.

389
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,410
We don't even need to go so far, I think.

390
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:05,830
Perhaps.

391
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,690
Maybe a little further.

392
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,090
Let's look for the bubbles.

393
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:10,990
Right?

394
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,750
How we saw those other guys with the bubbles.

395
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,970
I thought I saw somebody.

396
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,210
What?

397
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,810
At the top here?

398
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,330
What?

399
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,370
Ow!

400
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,850
Oh, I did.

401
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,070
That's a...

402
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,390
Ew.

403
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:38,210
I feel like these guys are an invasive species, and so I'm
doing my part by getting rid of them, actually.

404
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,810
My ass would have stayed in the primordial soup if I knew
this was gonna...

405
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,990
There were gonna be days like this!

406
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,850
No!

407
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,210
Who hurt you?

408
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,790
Oh, it's this guy.

409
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,870
Oh, it's an Inky.

410
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,030
No!

411
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,110
Ha!

412
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,210
Oh, dang it!

413
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,030
I saw him.

414
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,870
Oh, it's another Inky.

415
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,930
Inky nastiness.

416
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,890
That's a scientific name.

417
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:21,670
Hoi!

418
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,390
I'm ready.

419
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,090
I'm prepped.

420
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:29,850
Yes!

421
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,190
I told you I was already in prepped.

422
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,710
I think we...

423
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,150
Oh, there's another...

424
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,150
Oh, dang it.

425
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:37,710
Ah!

426
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,450
Mid-me-to, fish slayer and sea captain of capitalism.

427
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,970
What is your wisdom of the day?

428
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,900
Fish are always in demand.

429
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,180
If you...

430
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,400
Don't like your job...

431
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,580
Oh, there's some guys over there.

432
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,020
Consider becoming a fisher.

433
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:06,450
Okay.

434
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,770
I saw them.

435
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,150
I saw their fins.

436
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,930
They taunted me.

437
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,490
Wait, did I just see one?

438
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,890
That's an Inky Nasty right there.

439
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,010
You might did not get it.

440
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,770
Inky Nasty.

441
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,290
Always be fishing.

442
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,770
You could quit and become a fisherman.

443
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,380
Eyes on the prize.

444
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:38,900
Yes.

445
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,480
Oh, there's a good amount of guys here.

446
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,680
Oh, nice, nice.

447
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,300
We'll be making big bucks here.

448
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,980
We'll make big bucks here.

449
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,400
That's what Minto's all about.

450
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,080
Fish.

451
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,740
Maybe I should change my profession.

452
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,960
From mid to fisherman mid.

453
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,630
I know there's a bunch of you here.

454
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,370
Yes.

455
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,230
Yes.

456
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,630
Yes, yes, yes, I need an Inky Nasty, please.

457
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,050
Mermaid.

458
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,330
Mermaid.

459
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,210
Mermaid.

460
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,010
Oops, oops.

461
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,050
So true.

462
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,350
Okay, I know the guys.

463
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,850
The other ones came from this direction.

464
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,450
There it is.

Let's get our boat speed up What?

476
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,980
We even have enough to do the harpoon range.

477
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,000
I wonder how much of a range it is more, though.

478
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,000
Seems longer than a normal Chilizard game.

479
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,860
I know, right?

480
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,660
It's much longer, honestly.

481
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,980
Let's do it.

482
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,420
Da-da-da!

483
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,520
Hundred!

484
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,720
Three-ha- Well, if we get 10,000 yen here...

485
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,980
We're going to be making Buku Bucks in the next place,
surely.

486
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,820
I'm fast traveling.

487
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,340
To...

488
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,520
Where is it at again?

489
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,300
Okay, so we go to the school.

490
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,760
To the school.

491
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,460
Hello!

492
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm taking your suspicious seashells once again.

493
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,720
She does sell seashells.

494
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:29,960
by the seashore and I'm the one who's selling them fish
padding not a bad thing I mean at least I enjoy the fishing

495
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:48,160
at least I enjoy fishing game otherwise it'd be like a slog
maybe hello wait okay we do have enough money for gas at

496
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:59,060
least and we are headed to this way three bells three bells
hi hi hello welcome back

497
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,280
are there enough chillos games by now to do a tierless
stream you know actually right before stream i was

498
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,600
organizing some of my games kind of just to because i was
like i said i was trying to i said earlier i was trying to

499
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:20,620
figure out what to play next week and i was organizing my
games I've already completed that, you know, like one-shot

500
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,440
games that I wouldn't go back to.

501
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,400
Or just story games that I've already completed, things like
that.

502
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,400
And through my list was so many Chilla's games.

503
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:39,780
Chilla, I think I've bought, I know I haven't bought all of
them, but I have bought so many of them.

504
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,900
I have played so many of these games now.

505
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,020
If I don't play one, it honestly just feels like, Like, I'm
not doing my job or something.

506
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,360
You know what I mean?

507
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,160
It's so silly.

508
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,680
And it's really fun also to see, like, how...

509
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,580
Oh, it's like, what's that sound?

510
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,720
I think it's the wind chimes.

511
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,680
It sounds so peaceful, though.

512
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,020
I mean, this is your job.

513
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,760
It is totally my job.

514
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,760
But what I meant is, like, uh...

515
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,120
Is, uh...

516
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,320
Hello?

517
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,180
Where's the second bell?

518
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,100
Oh, there it is.

519
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,440
I think I got it.

520
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,100
I got it.

521
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,840
I got it.

522
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,220
What the heck is that?

523
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,400
Oh, there it is.

524
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,220
Oh, shoot.

525
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,700
Oh, shoot.

526
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,200
Oh, shoot.

527
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,580
I got lost.

528
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,160
Can I juke her?

529
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:50,980
Oh, my God.

530
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,400
Oh, my God.

531
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,660
We're gonna get eaten, guys.

532
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,280
We're gonna get eaten.

533
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,820
Okay, let's try that again.

534
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,740
But yeah, it is fun to see, like, how they've kind of
developed their games over time.

535
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,120
It's truly fun to see, in my opinion.

536
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,060
Resting with the fishies.

537
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,040
I'm gonna change this to this.

538
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,780
So we don't get lost again.

539
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,940
I also got caught on...

540
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,700
There's, like, no room for error in this.

541
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,200
It's crazy.

542
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,480
Okay, here we go.

543
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,320
There we go!

544
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,200
Here we go!

545
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,410
Maybe?

546
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,710
Oh yeah, we got that.

547
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,390
Easy.

548
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,510
Oh my god, oh my god, she's kept coming towards me!

549
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,070
I thought... I thought...

550
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,410
This is not half fuel, don't lie to me.

551
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,690
Holy cow, that was scary, huh?

552
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,910
She came through the gate.

553
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,310
I thought we were done for.

554
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,870
Because I just stopped.

555
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,010
I was like, okay, we're here.

556
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:32,430
La la la.

557
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,550
Hi.

558
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,190
I made it.

559
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,670
There's a train nearby.

560
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,010
Oh, is it that?

561
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,670
It's half fuel if you ignore the reserve.

562
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,290
Right.

563
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,330
Here comes the pain train.

564
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,050
What does that mean?

565
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,390
You know the girl on that train?

566
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,610
I can't really get close to her.

567
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,770
Half the stuff she says, I can't make sense of it.

568
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,270
I just hope she finds some peace and a way out.

569
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,730
Through my harpoon.

570
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,790
It doesn't help there are rumors.

571
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,290
There are rumors and Umibozu, a sea giant is nearby.

572
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,950
Gives me the creeps.

573
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,680
What about the fish here?

574
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,790
You confident with your harpoon?

575
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:35,250
this area is called pain train station is it really if you
are then use boost and go for it if not one trick is to get

576
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:42,530
close first then use bait but there's a fish that'll steal
your catch and eat it so yeah watch out for that one too

577
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:48,830
this is getting complicated things are getting complicated
so what's my task head to the station

578
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,430
So what kind of fishies we got in here?

579
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,380
Is that her crouched over?

580
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,860
Hold on.

581
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,240
We got the gold paint for our boat.

582
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,520
Oh, we got flying guys again.

583
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,380
Oh, look at them!

584
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,540
Wait, they're cute.

585
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,660
I probably missed one in that one building that I...

586
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,600
That had, like, the guys that would attack you.

587
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,420
Okay.

588
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:32,960
Dang.

589
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,480
My...

590
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,020
Return is like crazy now.

591
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,800
Have you noticed that?

592
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,140
I didn't upgrade that though.

593
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:43,760
I didn't...

594
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,180
I...

595
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,420
I upgraded the range.

596
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,080
But why is my return like so fast now?

597
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,760
Do you guys see that?

598
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,300
Yeah, it comes back instantly.

599
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,240
You usually have to pay for an upgrade for that.

600
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:23,250
huh I'm like still trying I'm like failing on all these guys
though anyway hello oh don't come any closer you're gonna

601
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:31,070
eat me too aren't you wait was it you after that next stop
my sister just vanished was it you who did it my sister used

602
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:38,430
to say all the time there aren't any decent people left in
the world so you're the same kind of good for nothing aren't

603
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:45,130
you don't come near me don't touch anything give me my
sister back if you're gonna lie and say you didn't eat it

604
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:50,330
then take me to the next station and prove it but you can't
move the train without the lever so i guess that's

605
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:58,250
impossible huh and i'm too scared to move if you're really
not some good for nothing then go find the lever we need to

606
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:09,130
get this train moving okay find the lever her name's reno
huh lever required Okay, I can't exit.

607
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,450
I'm not skinny enough for that door, huh?

608
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,010
These guys seem difficult.

609
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,110
Oh, the lava cronk.

610
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:20,970
Can I walk on this?

611
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,350
I wonder.

612
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,780
Oh, see, now it's taking...

613
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,260
Okay, okay.

614
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,240
That's so weird that it was like instant coming back to me.

615
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,520
Now it's taking its sweet time.

616
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,080
I wonder how far I can walk down this.

617
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,700
Is there a hot...

618
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,420
I can't...

619
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,280
Oh my gosh, wait.

620
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,120
They like swim right in front of me, though.

621
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,500
Which is kind of nice.

622
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,560
Except when they're so fast.

623
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,000
La la la la la la.

624
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,640
What are you?

625
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,120
Oh, it's a blobfish!

626
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,660
Okay, let's go back.

627
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,810
We got some bait.

628
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,330
We got some bait.

629
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,190
Very good.

630
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,310
Wait.

631
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:28,770
Actually.

632
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,310
Who is the guy that's gonna try and eat our fish is my
question.

633
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,270
I'm scared about that.

634
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,140
Anybody?

635
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:42,960
Any takers?

636
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,200
I see like a really slow guy coming in from over there.

637
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:48,980
Hello?

638
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,640
Oh, it's just more blobfish.

639
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,160
You too.

640
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,860
I also hear that giant fish!

641
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,840
There he is!

642
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,290
Where are you giant fish?

643
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,050
Where'd you go?

644
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,530
Oh, you're over there.

645
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,810
Yes, I see you, I see you, I see you.

646
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,170
Oh, he's so scary though.

647
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,830
over here more

648
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:47,030
oh, I got eyes closed I need to find an open eye excuse me
let me try the other side uh uh

649
00:47:50,090 --> 00:48:03,380
you guys see one that one oh yes it is oh oh oh oh

650
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,800
We got the second piece, the second tablet.

651
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,020
Oh my gosh.

652
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:25,640
How much?

653
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,540
Look at the lips on this sucker.

654
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh, wait.

655
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,840
Where's the...

656
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,540
Wait, where did...

657
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:33,680
What?

658
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,960
This away!

659
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,040
How much is this guy gonna sell for, I wonder?

660
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,760
Use him as bait.

661
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,160
Save?

662
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:50,740
Oh.

663
00:48:51,760 --> 00:49:03,400
we'll save once we sell him because well I should save
anyway because what I was gonna say is I don't think I'll

664
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:14,640
run out of fuel but just in case 500k you think so that
would be awesome that would be huge money I wonder who's the

665
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,260
guy that eats my bait, though.

666
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,220
You're guessing 300k.

667
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:32,580
I think more because I think 500k makes sense because we had
to go to three areas to get this guy.

668
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,060
It was no easy potatoes.

669
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,960
Hello, I have the big met.

670
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,440
I caught a giant angler fish.

671
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,380
Is that what he's?

672
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,920
Wait, can I see him from behind?

673
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,780
You actually got that thing.

674
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,240
Huh?

675
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,520
A second tablet shard.

676
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,320
Ah, well, keep it up, yeah?

677
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,440
Wait, I want to see a...

678
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,360
I just...

679
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,340
Whoa!

680
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,440
Oh, oh.

681
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,960
Oh, whoa!

682
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,440
Oh, wow!

683
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,720
Crazy!

684
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,220
Anyway, I'm taking the shortcut.

685
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,840
This is so...

686
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,340
Anyway, uh...

687
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,300
So?

688
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,300
75,000!

689
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,520
Guys.

690
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,680
Guys!

691
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,890
Not even 75,000.

692
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,250
750,000!

693
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,130
Holy cow!

694
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,450
What do we upgrade?

695
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,150
Okay, we upgrade our boat speed.

696
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,350
First of all, because we're We'll need to... Oh, wait.

697
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,210
There's gonna be another one?

698
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:58,730
The price went up again.

699
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,930
We upgrade our fuel capacity.

700
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,070
We upgrade our harpoon stuff.

701
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,350
I could do the rest of the harpoon things.

702
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:24,120
It says 5 out of 5 because I think you have to unlock the
next one at the next area.

703
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:32,060
Then it will say it only says like 3 out of five because i
haven't been keeping up with like paying for all of them

704
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:41,820
sonar speed it's cheap that's true i do use it the boost i
wonder if we'll need it for later like a boss fight or

705
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:50,820
something you know i haven't been i you can't use it in the
areas with the with the giant monster that's trying to eat

706
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:59,040
you so i haven't been like worrying about it but i'm
wondering a boss fight that you'll need it.

707
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,940
Bait range is king as well?

708
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,480
Okay, we'll try that.

709
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,800
NPCs do keep mentioning boost.

710
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:10,480
You're right.

711
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,840
I'll do that instead of my harpoon.

712
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,810
Oh, the boost speed!

713
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,030
We completely bought all of those upgrades.

714
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:27,530
Nice!

715
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,530
I'll even do the bait range.

716
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:31,230
Okay.

717
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,310
Okay.

718
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,740
Yeah, this level did say, this did say, like, boost and...

719
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,160
Boost and...

720
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,500
Bait and stuff for this one.

721
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:47,840
Wow, whoa!

722
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,020
We did so many upgrades!

723
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,080
Let's go!

724
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,760
Oh, look at it!

725
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,500
Ew.

726
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,740
Wait, that's a human.

727
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,040
And a fish.

728
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:58,760
Ew.

729
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,660
Let's save.

730
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,260
Let's save.

731
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,620
Let's save.

732
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,900
And then let's go get some...

733
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,660
Oh, wait.

734
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,080
Nope.

735
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,200
Let's get some fuel.

736
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,840
All right.

737
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,340
All right, all right.

738
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,220
And we're trying to find a lever.

739
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,320
What the heck is this guy?

740
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,500
Oh.

741
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,600
Oh.

742
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:32,280
Oh.

743
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:32,460
Oh.

744
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,460
Oh.

745
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,520
Oh, he's worth a good amount, though.

746
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:44,360
I'm wondering, I guess these are the guys that might try to
eat my

747
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,460
if I, like, do the bait.

748
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,420
But hey, I think I'm willing to use Oh,

749
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:09,710
there's another one.

750
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,530
Now I want to know how much the flying guys are.

751
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:18,130
I imagine maybe 300,000.

752
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,750
That's my guess.

753
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:22,430
That is my guess.

754
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:23,870
All right.

755
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,670
I'm going to throw it out over here.

756
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:32,490
Oh!

757
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:32,570
Ew!

758
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,710
Ew!

759
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,860
How much was it?

760
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,320
How much was it?

761
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,200
300!

762
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,560
Yes, uh, yes.

763
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,120
Oh, I keep saying 300.

764
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,080
Sorry, my brain in numbers.

765
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,280
But yes, I was right what I was thinking.

766
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:58,500
Yes!

767
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,920
Yes!

768
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,620
Yes!

769
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,380
Everybody still in?

770
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:05,480
Oh!

771
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,880
Okay, clearly...

772
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,280
No!

773
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,920
Not everybody can stay in the boat.

774
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,000
No!

775
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,420
No!

776
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,040
No!

777
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,060
No!

778
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,280
I don't know where I dropped him.

779
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:24,940
No!

780
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,020
No!

781
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,460
You need a bigger boat.

782
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,640
I wish we could have a boat capacity.

783
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,200
Or at least if I could put them in like a dang tro- like a
chest or something.

784
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,240
Oh, don't!

785
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,420
Wasted.

786
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,500
Yeah, 325 if you ignore.

787
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,620
I'm gonna use these guys.

788
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,060
I know they're worth a lot.

789
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,480
But I'm gonna start using them as bait.

790
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,240
They're very easy to get.

791
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,080
And I don't want them eating.

792
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,040
My...

793
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,220
My more expensive guys.

794
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,040
because they take up so much space in here.

795
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,900
Wait, did I just lose?

796
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,180
Okay, there we go.

797
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,400
Alright.

798
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,900
Let's drive a little over here.

799
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,420
Alright, alright.

800
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,480
And I see no sharks.

801
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,280
So I'm gonna throw.

802
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,660
See if anyone comes up.

803
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,820
Actually, I kind of want to see him, like, eat one, though,
you know?

804
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,680
Hey, hey!

805
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:36,640
Oh!

806
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:40,770
Oh!

807
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:42,890
saw him eat one.

808
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,050
What the hell?

809
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:45,210
You bastard!

810
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,310
I got no money at all.

811
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:55,470
Because of him.

812
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,180
Over here seems like a lot.

813
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,080
Yeah.

814
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:05,720
This is good.

816
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,260
This is good.

817
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,480
Everybody?

818
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,600
Wait, did I just...

819
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:16,680
Oh!

820
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,020
Ah!

821
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:17,820
No!

822
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:18,760
No!

823
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,060
No!

824
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:19,200
Oh!

825
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,320
here they come they come

826
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:37,760
oh they're huge they're really big okay I feel like I got
the bait thing but it does not okay I guess that feels a

827
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:52,680
little further away here he comes here he comes nice they do
look happy don't they maybe being a fish is bliss fish is

828
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,280
bliss.

829
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,420
Let me take off my...

830
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,280
Let me go.

831
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,360
Oh, they're so slippery.

832
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,120
Even docking is scary.

833
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,720
I wonder where my other one went if maybe it despawned.

834
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:22,840
Holy!

835
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:23,520
Holy!

836
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,140
Holy!

837
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,840
Let's go!

838
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,700
Maybe range means how many fish it attracts.

839
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,640
Oh, that's probably it.

840
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,960
You're probably right.

841
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,980
Rather than my throw range, it's probably the range at
which...

842
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,460
Oh, you're probably right!

843
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,100
That makes way more sense.

844
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:49,980
Hmm.

845
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,220
Okay.

846
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,140
We got some money.

847
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:03,400
for now let's uh let's drive into whatever this place is

855
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:39,290

ghost those little guys as It's like they're avoiding the

856
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,570
light because they're bothered by how dirty they are.

857
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,270
Could you bring me three of them so I can wash them?

858
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,510
Looks like you'll need a light to find that fish.

859
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,730
Eating untainted fish with an untainted body.

860
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,370
Oh, how wonderful that sounds.

861
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,550
Find the light.

862
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,430
What the heck does this mean?

863
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:01,850
Okay, we have two side quests.

864
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,110
We're finding the light.

865
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,610
and finding the lever.

866
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,270
I am untainted.

867
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:17,730
I untainted body.

868
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,390
Wait, so what's going on in here?

869
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:21,290
Am I going to be scared?

870
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:22,210
Is it going to be dark?

871
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,690
It doesn't look that dark in here.

872
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,170
Wait, what's this over here?

873
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,150
This isn't the train that I was just at, is it?

874
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:42,650
This is different?

875
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,130
I think?

876
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:47,150
Yeah.

877
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:52,490
Oh.

878
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,310
What is that?

879
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,270
Clothes?

880
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,250
Hmm.

881
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,130
What is there?

882
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,890
I like how much...

883
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,090
Oh.

884
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,390
What's going on down here?

885
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,520
Am I going to turn around?

886
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:13,980
Wait!

887
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,120
It's donkey!

888
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,730
Am I going to turn around and get jump scared?

889
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:20,550
Oh.

890
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:21,870
Wait, what is...

891
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:22,570
Oh, there's another one.

892
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:34,970
So far, there hasn't really been any jump scares, have
there?

893
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,350
Not really, at least.

894
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:41,930
We found Oki.

895
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,830
Okay, back to the construction site.

896
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:52,950
Just weirdness.

897
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,870
Yeah, just uncomfy, right?

898
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:58,070
Just a little uncomfy so far.

899
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:00,270
Which I'm okay with.

900
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:01,030
Oh, oops.

901
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,230
That's fine.

902
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:08,610
Actually, I should have done that just to get back to my
Ship faster.

903
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,010
Wait, so they're in here?

904
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:12,810
Hello?

905
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,360
I need to find the light

906
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,760
I can't climb this as things Is it something to do with this
sky?

907
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,840
I'm gonna see if there's any sort of ladder that I can climb

908
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,340
I'm not seeing anything.

909
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,460
Let's try the Ferris wheel?

910
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,900
Holy, we are boosting!

911
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:51,960
Oh my god!

912
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,500
When I use the boost, we go crazy!

913
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,560
Crazy mode.

914
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,380
I thought I saw something.

915
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,240
Hold to fuel and rotate the Ferris wheel.

916
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,560
I'm so small.

917
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,440
Oh, I got every spray can!

918
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,600
Let's go.

919
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,400
Uh-oh, I'm using my own fuel for this.

920
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,100
Oh, okay.

921
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,660
Do I have to check?

922
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,860
Like, it's odd.

923
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,540
Oh, there's one up there that's a different color.

924
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,200
You see it?

925
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:34,680
Okay.

926
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:40,380
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

927
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,970
Oh my god, it's draining so much of my fuel!

928
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,220
We got it.

929
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:04,140
Yay!

930
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,360
Wait.

931
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,900
Oh, light installed.

932
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,120
Shop updated.

933
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,900
Oh, the shop updates even!

934
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,420
Oh, look at that!

935
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:20,860
Oh my, oh, my eyes.

936
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:25,240
Oh, oh, oh, my cursor is now like the light!

937
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,260
Oh, interesting.

938
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,080
I can see so well now, though.

939
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,360
Oh, cool.

940
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:38,700
Extra, extra meat.

941
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:45,100
You definitely want to refuel and sell things.

942
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:49,400
So that I can, uh...

943
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,460
Go find some three-eyed fishies.

944
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,140
Alan Wake.

945
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,640
No!

946
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,380
Uh, shop.

947
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,740
Sell.

948
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,780
And then what do we have for the light?

949
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:06,360
Oh.

950
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,560
You saw that, though.

951
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,480
Is it the shop upgraded?

952
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:14,880
Or updated?

953
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:17,960
Okay.

954
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:18,880
Never mind.

955
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:20,740
Lies.

956
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:22,940
Lies.

957
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:30,470
I don't know how I feel about the light, I'll be honest.

958
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,070
I can't see anything!

959
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:36,190
It's so bright!

960
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:43,530
I'm gonna... well, actually...

961
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,550
I was gonna get some of those fishies.

962
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:48,490
But...

963
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:49,370
We could still do that.

964
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,430
I'll just go, like, get one and sell it.

965
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,170
You know?

966
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,280
Hoi!

967
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,480
Come on in!

968
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,540
Oh, oh, oh!

969
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:09,100
Yay!

970
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,660
Maybe we can get a second one.

971
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,440
That'd be awesome.

972
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,080
Oh, lucky!

973
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,200
Oh, lucky.

974
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,640
Oh, we barely just missed this guy.

975
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,840
I'll take him, too.

976
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,040
Great snipe.

977
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,440
Yeah, we got so lucky.

978
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:30,980
I'll take you, too.

979
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,740
Oh, my gosh.

980
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,580
I have to really watch my speed now.

981
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,640
My boat is too fast and these fish are too slippery.

982
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,060
Please!

983
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,200
Can you buy my fish from down here?

984
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,280
Thank you.

985
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,420
We can even...

986
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,000
Oh my gosh, we're like making so much money now.

987
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,720
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

988
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:04,820
Alright.

989
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:07,460
Let's...

990
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,620
I'm gonna save real quick.

991
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,120
Yes.

992
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:25,200

994
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:41,480
way.

995
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:44,600
Hello!

996
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,600
I can't see anything.

997
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,680
It's so dark.

998
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,620
This is where I'm supposed to find these fish, right?

999
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,620
Do you guys hear the...

1000
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:00,840
Oh!

1001
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,120
I think I saw one.

1002
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,730
It's so quiet.

1003
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,120
You heard it, right?

1004
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:17,940
Oh, okay, good.

1005
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:18,920
It wasn't footsteps.

1006
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:19,660
It was like a...

1007
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,200
It was like a very, like a...

1008
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,960
I don't know how else to describe it.

1009
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,060
There, there, right there.

1010
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,320
Oh, there's one!

1011
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,160
I think they're the ones...

1012
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,780
It looks like Mike Wasowski.

1013
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,040
It looks like Mike Wasowski.

1014
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,780
Oh, they're like, I think they're hissing from the light.

1015
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,420
Yeah, they're hissing from the light, I think.

1016
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,600
Oh, they're worth it.

1017
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,200
Uh-oh.

1018
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,100
Uh, one second.

1019
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,140
My camera froze for a second.

1020
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,260
Yeah, it's going...

1021
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,840
They're worth a good amount, though.

1022
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:19,080
Hmm.

1023
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:24,640
Hello.

1024
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,800
I know you were here.

1025
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,020
Oh.

1026
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:35,560
Oh.

1027
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,420
Where is he?

1028
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,120
Where are you?

1029
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,280
I hear you hissing.

1030
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,000
Maybe I went to the other side.

1031
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:52,460
Maybe.

1032
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,280
I don't know how to get in over here, though.

1033
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,420
I don't know if I can.

1034
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,300
Oh, I think all the way on that end.

1035
01:10:59,460 --> 01:10:59,860
But that's okay.

1036
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,300
We'll try from here.

1037
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:09,170
Did I just see something swim past?

1038
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:10,530
Like, over there?

1039
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:12,810
Ah!

1040
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,170
Oh!

1041
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,420
Where do you go?

1042
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:17,980
Where do you go?

1043
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:19,980
Got him.

1044
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,180
Yeah, they're invisible till you shine the light on them.

1045
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:23,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1046
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,060
I just couldn't hear them.

1047
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,800
They kind of give like an audio cue, which is nice.

1048
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,960
Oh, they're here and here too!

1049
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:32,700
Ooh!

1050
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,800
They're out here also.

1051
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,280
Okay, we just needed three of them, no?

1052
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,040
I'm chugging away.

1053
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,060
Okay.

1054
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,600
Number one.

1055
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,430
Into the dryer.

1056
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,590
Number two.

1057
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,930
Into the dryer.

1058
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:05,930
You think they're kind of cute?

1059
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:08,570
Do they look like me?

1060
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,390
Maybe if they had big old blue eyes.

1061
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:19,750
Oh my gosh.

1062
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:20,330
Oh!

1063
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,010
Wait for the laundry to finish.

1064
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,270
You still have all your panties on, right?

1065
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,670
What is happening here?

1066
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36,090
Hello?

1067
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,430
Oh, oops, my bad.

1068
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:44,660
Is that it?

1069
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,040
What am I supposed to do?

1070
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:47,780
Is there...

1071
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,420
Oh, maybe the lever is in here?

1072
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,000
Okay.

1073
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,560
I think he died.

1074
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,220
It's so loud, I just want to get out of here.

1075
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,360
Okay.

1076
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,100
I think he's dead.

1077
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,000
Boopsy, boopsy.

1078
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,100
Never got...

1079
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,320
Never got his fish.

1080
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,120
Maybe he...

1081
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,780
What a way to go.

1082
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,400
It's kind of crazy.

1083
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,160
I'm here to help you.

1084
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,160
Bye, Bolt!

1085
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:32,860
Goodbye, by...

1086
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,700
Goodbye, by Bolt!

1087
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:35,580
Uh-oh.

1088
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,380
Wait, my Bolt.

1089
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,060
Are you okay?

1090
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,600
You don't want to talk?

1091
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,540
That's wrong, right now.

1092
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:54,720
Wow!

1093
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,200
We're on the train!

1094
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:57,740
This guy's...

1095
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:58,240
Oh, whoa.

1096
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:58,900
What's happening?

1097
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,220
Wait, what's going on?

1098
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,700
Wait, why is it...

1099
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,380
Why is it scary?

1100
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:05,800
Wait, that's not good.

1101
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:06,700
Uh-oh.

1102
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,320
What's happening?

1103
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,080
Are you okay?

1104
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:08,960
Wait, why are we...

1105
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,360
Are we okay?

1106
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,120
What's happening?

1107
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,180
I see the station.

1108
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,520
We should be fine.

1109
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,640
Is there something following us?

1110
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,860
Oh, no.

1111
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:22,480
Oh.

1112
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,940
Oh, shoot.

1113
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,060
Oh, shoot.

1114
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:28,800
Oh, shoot.

1115
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,720
Oh, oh, oh.

1116
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:34,640
Oh.

1117
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:40,420
What?

1118
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,260
Ouch.

1119
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:41,840
Ouch.

1120
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:42,460
Ouch.

1121
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:42,900
Ouch.

1122
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,080
Ouch.

1123
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:43,180
Ouch.

1124
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,060
Oh my gosh.

1125
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,180
Oh my gosh.

1126
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,010
I'm working on it.

1127
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:00,160
Are we good?

1128
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:02,040
Oh.

1129
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,550
Oh, everything's fine.

1130
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,060
Everything's A.

1131
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:09,360
Okay.

1132
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,060
Who are we waiting to pass?

1133
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,360
We are the train.

1134
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:19,160
Why were we waiting for another train to pass?

1135
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,320
I didn't see one.

1136
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,120
Yeah, minor setback.

1137
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,640
Is it going to happen again?

1138
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,460
I'm concerned that the fact that we're not already at the
station means it's going to happen twice.

1139
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,680
I was correcting my assumption.

1140
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,760
Oh, my...

1141
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,200
Oh, shoot.

1142
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,560
Let me follow you!

1143
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,860
He was freaky!

1144
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,660
Oh, I think we're here!

1145
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,860
I think we're here!

1146
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,220
The next stop is...

1147
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,520
Oh, wait, we just went in a big old circle.

1148
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,540
Is that your sister?

1149
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:25,980
Uh-oh.

1150
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,100
I have bad news for you.

1151
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,160
The Eldritch Tentacle Horror from the Deep.

1152
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,480
Think trains are neat.

1153
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,060
Go to play with one that is operational.

1154
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,400
It freaking stabs you.

1155
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:38,800
Ouch.

1156
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,760
Like how she has her headphones on, unbothered.

1157
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,220
Is that your sister or...

1158
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,860
You know, I've been thinking about my sister this whole
time.

1159
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,460
Her last conversation, it was full of nothing but despair.

1160
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,600
She said, I don't want to disappear.

1161
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,860
I want to go back to the sea.

1162
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,700
And I couldn't bring myself to listen.

1163
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:09,860
And when I watched her while she was talking, it seems like
all of the humans don't like being fish and all the fish

1164
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,020
don't like being humans.

1165
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,220
I think that maybe that's what we're trying to do is bring
things back to the natural order.

1166
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,740
When I watched her while she was talking, she was talking.

1167
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,300
I'm the one who ate my sister!

1168
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,600
The real good for nothing was me.

1169
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,960
I was so hungry, I didn't know what else to do!

1170
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,760
She was so important to me, and still, maybe I've been
running away this whole time.

1171
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,580
I'm awful.

1172
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,880
Oh, thank you so much for the breather!

1173
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,120
Hello, readers!

1174
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,980
Cannibalism happened again.

1175
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,960
Don't worry, she's not a human, she's a fish.

1176
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:01,310
But when I look at you, I feel like someone can...

1177
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:04,190
Someone like me can take a step forward for her sake too.

1178
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:08,730
In this hopeless world, I can finally see a glimpse of life.

1179
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:09,850
Remak, thank you!

1180
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:12,530
I'll leave something on the train for you.

1181
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,010
Just a small thank you.

1182
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,790
Thank you.

1183
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,010
This is where you ate her.

1184
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:20,870
Yikes.

1185
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,130
Another bell, another bell!

1186
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,530
Wait, can I stop at my... Wait a second, I just realized.

1187
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:39,010
Does it stop at my... Oh, okay, yeah, it's gonna stop over
there.

1188
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:42,970
Phil, thank you!

1189
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,490
Believe it or not, 117XX, same as yesterday for cannibalism.

1190
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:50,310
Freaky!

1191
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:51,710
No way!

1192
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:56,710
We're on a cannibalism schedule, baby.

1193
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,130
Cannibalism always comes on time.

1194
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:09,890
Three bells again.

1195
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,500
Okay, I have trouble with getting on the rocks.

1196
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,140
Can I have a minto on the rocks?

1197
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,120
Melly, welcome back.

1198
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:35,640
Thank you.

1199
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,120
I brought back three bells.

1200
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,320
You brought the bell with you.

1201
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,140
I'll attach it.

1202
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,600
Nathan, thank you so much for the gift.

1203
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,160
This is the last bell to be installed.

1204
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:47,860
Good work.

1205
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,840
Keep it up, my friend.

1206
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:53,900
The last bell!

1207
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,460
We did it!

1208
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,140
We did it!

1209
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,740
Okay, though.

1210
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:01,340
Wait, though.

1211
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:01,960
Look at this.

1212
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,480
It looks like so expansive.

1213
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,480
We didn't even reach the edge of the...

1214
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,660
of the area.

1215
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,500
It's kind of fun.

1216
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:11,420
If we go out there and we see Umibozu, I wonder.

1217
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,540
Should we experiment?

1218
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,530
Are you safe?

1219
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,190
We're just gonna explore right quick.

1220
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:28,970
With the intention of not coming back.

1221
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,630
Because I might run out of...

1222
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:35,910
I feel like I'll run out of...

1223
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,470
What's it called anyway?

1224
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,150
Um, gas.

1225
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,870
High speeds.

1226
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:53,060
I'm like, just, I'm just gonna follow the, you know.

1227
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,740
There's that lighthouse!

1228
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,080
We couldn't make it to there before.

1229
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:03,940
Wait.

1230
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:05,480
That makes no sense.

1231
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,000
How are we able to see it from here?

1232
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,440
Oh, look, there's the edge.

1233
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:27,700
because i saw it didn't i see it went like all the way
somewhere else oh hmm couple thank you

1234
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:43,580
i feel like we can make it there maybe

1235
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:56,500
maybe i mean i already did say we were gonna go this way
with the intention of not making it back but paying train

1236
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:14,820

01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:28,220
Wait.

1240
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:35,690
Wait.

1241
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:38,410
Wait.

1242
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:39,150
Wait.

1243
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,540
I'm trying to get him to crash into me.

1244
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,600
Can I talk to you?

1245
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,360
Ah!

1246
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,240
There has to be something with this guy.

1247
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:00,880
Hello?

1248
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:01,700
Hello?

1249
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,660
Oh, yeah, let's harpoon him.

1250
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:05,320
Let's harpoon him.

1251
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,500
I'm, like, following him.

1252
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,880
I wanted to talk to him, not harpoon him, but...

1253
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,340
You leave me...

1254
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:22,540
Oh!

1255
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,080
You leave me with no choice, Tira.

1256
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,410
Oh, my gosh.

1257
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,370
I feel like I'm in a dogfight right now.

1258
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:33,130
Uh-oh.

1259
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:34,730
Oh, my heal!

1260
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,740
Oh, he's fast.

1261
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:00,160
Oh, my God!

1262
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,100
Oh!

1263
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,040
I had him a couple times.

1264
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,960
I feel like I...

1265
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,280
I got him!

1266
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,220
He was crying!

1267
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:35,880
I got an achievement for it.

1268
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,180
Okay, let's go back home.

1269
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,280
That's fun.

1270
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,520
Wait, where am I?

1271
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:42,940
Oh.

1272
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:43,980
Oh geez.

1273
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:45,120
Are we gonna make it back home?

1274
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:47,700
We could try.

1275
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,180
I'm halfway.

1276
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,180
Take his boat.

1277
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,660
Actually, I'm going to hold you so that I don't lose...

1278
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,380
Wait, how much are you?

1279
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,860
Yeah, I'm going to hold on to you.

1280
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:05,960
200k!

1281
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:14,420
Money, baby, money, money, money, baby, money, money, money.

1282
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,880
I'm seeing that boosting does not make the fuel go down
anymore.

1283
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,760
Like, any faster, you know?

1284
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:30,080
Wow, I feel like we didn't go out that far at all.

1285
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,300
Maybe the train was really slow.

1286
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:37,470
Wait, where is he?

1287
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,590
Oh.

1288
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:42,230
He's still on my boat, right?

1289
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:42,810
Does that count?

1290
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,350
Hello?

1291
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:50,770
Tuna with legs!

1292
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:54,890
Yippee!

1293
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:00,490
Nice.

1294
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,330
Maybe we do upgrade my harpoon.

1295
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:10,650
There was another talk option.

1296
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:11,670
Oh, is there?

1297
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:15,230
No.

1298
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:17,150
There wasn't.

1299
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:19,170
I think it was just about the fish here.

1300
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:21,090
Which is normal.

1301
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:22,550
Yay!

1302
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:24,170
We got that fish.

1303
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:24,950
We got it.

1304
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:36,030
let's see all right um maybe get the fuel option

1305
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:55,200
i mean i could okay i do want to make my harpoon better
though i think harpoon is more important oh gosh it's gonna

1306
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,360
be another upgrade that's crazy

1307
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:06,080
feels like the harpoon is being used a lot more during
fights i agree that's why like having the speed and the

1308
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:16,740
range and everything or the reel coming back faster would be
good um okay so now let's fast travel to the first island i

1309
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:31,170
want to change my oh i like the black is this one new no
that one's not new oh my goodness the gold is Wow.

1310
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:33,390
Is this one new?

1311
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,250
Full wide.

1312
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,570
Is this one new?

1313
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:38,830
It looks newish.

1314
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:41,110
Oh!

1315
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:44,970
That's interesting.

1316
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:45,870
It's cute.

1317
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:47,690
I don't know for a boat.

1318
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:54,770
This one looks like a real boat now, doesn't it?

1319
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:57,730
It's a knit boat.

1320
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:00,110
Alrighty!

1321
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,610
Let's head to that last area.

1322
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,010
Where's my harpoon?

1323
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:13,010
Wait.

1324
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:15,150
It's saying throw slash drop.

1325
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:16,350
Wait a second.

1326
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:19,190
Uh, I'm gonna reset.

1327
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:19,990
Wait.

1328
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:22,270
You guys see that though, right?

1329
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:25,290
It's saying throw slash drop, like right above my head.

1330
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:30,250
And I think maybe the tuna glitched out.

1331
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:32,410
I don't have my harpoon anymore.

1332
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:33,690
Okay.

1333
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:34,970
Uh-oh.

1334
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:36,210
Uh-oh.

1335
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:38,030
I don't have my harpoon anymore.

1336
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:39,930
Look how many we've gotten though.

1337
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:41,610
We see Q.

1338
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,850
Yeah, the Q is the throw slash drop.

1339
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:44,550
Uh-oh.

1340
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:50,890
I just saved because I didn't realize.

1341
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:54,190
Let me try loading.

1342
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:04,430
I think...

1343
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:05,510
Okay, we're good.

1344
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:05,930
We're good.

1345
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:07,730
We're heading to the city.

1346
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:10,310
Okay.

1347
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,370
Let's go!

1348
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:23,070
This one over here.

1349
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:26,870
Just normal Chilla Jank.

1350
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,310
Yeah, you get used to it.

1351
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:30,970
Yeah.

1352
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:33,310
Alright, let's hope we don't die here.

1353
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:34,530
Alright, I see the first... Wait.

1354
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:37,230
I just realized...

1355
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:38,830
Level 5, is that what that says?

1356
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:39,810
We are level 5.

1357
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:40,050
Okay.

1358
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:43,670
mark that as our objective.

1359
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,570
Okay, let's go!

1360
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,880
Why is it in the sky?

1361
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:14,760
Okay, we're close.

1362
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:15,920
I think we're good.

1363
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:18,120
Easy peasy.

1364
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah, oh, keep going.

1365
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,640
Easy peasy.

1366
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,040
Omnis city front.

1367
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:29,640
Oh, whoops.

1368
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:35,920
I guess I could have saved after going to the gas station,
but whatever.

1369
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:38,060
Woo-hoo!

1370
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:40,620
Yahoo!

1371
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,540
I'm here.

1372
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,280
Hi, I made it.

1373
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,300
Nice city.

1374
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,180
We got going on here.

1375
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,760
It's like mixed between Tokyo Tower Skytree.

1376
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:57,980
About the city ahead.

1377
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:00,320
You're thinking of going to that city, huh?

1378
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,380
Hmm.

1379
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:02,280
Yeah, I see.

1380
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,120
That place is where the dangerous ones gather.

1381
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,100
Oh, no!

1382
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,480
We go there too, but let's just say things are getting out
of hand fast.

1383
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:14,160
Customers are getting pickier, too.

1384
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,460
Becoming real gourmet.

1385
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:18,380
They're getting more and more insatiable by the day.

1386
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,900
And some of us vanishing all of a sudden.

1387
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,760
It's not just once or twice either.

1388
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,760
The city is full of unknowns.

1389
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,160
I wouldn't recommend going in.

1390
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,580
Maybe, just maybe you could be the one to turn this all
around.

1391
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,260
Yes, he's selling a shotgun.

1392
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,160
Yeah, Mr. Rem, I need some, like, you know.

1393
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:47,670
This city is full of unknowns.

1394
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:48,830
What does that mean?

1395
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:52,110
We don't even have an objective.

1396
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:55,450
I don't want unknowns.

1397
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:57,230
Well, who are you?

1398
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:02,380
Hello.

1399
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,860
I'm boarding the ship.

1400
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,340
Is this your first time in the city?

1401
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:11,540
The city has a person in each district looking for a
specific fish.

1402
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,840
There are four of them in total, but...

1403
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,140
Their requests are pretty tough.

1404
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,200
But if you can fulfill the request, it sounds like you'll
get something in return.

1405
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,120
But maybe you could handle it.

1406
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,780
I marked them on your map, so if you want, please go check
them out.

1407
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,320
Oh, before you do... before that, do you see the tower right
over there?

1408
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,720
That's the symbol of the city.

1409
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,020
You might want to visit the tower first.

1410
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,480
That doesn't sound like a...

1411
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,120
Like a suggestion.

1412
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,380
sounded like a, you should visit the tower first.

1413
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:41,080
Whoa.

1414
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,680
Oh, this place is huge.

1415
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:54,140
I wonder what kind of game they're going to make next after
this.

1416
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,500
I'm sorry, a lighting!

1417
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:58,320
No, what?

1418
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:59,560
What the hell is that?

1419
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,500
Is that, no way, is that a lizard?

1420
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:05,220
Lizards persist?

1421
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:06,760
Oh, wow, there's so many people.

1422
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:09,960
Chilla in space?

1423
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,540
Yeah, we're gonna get to space, eventually.

1424
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,020
Ah, to you.

1425
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:19,400
So you really are not like the others in this world.

1426
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,020
Oh, it's the girl from the shrine!

1427
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,360
Why did... How did you... Why did...

1428
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,920
I'm doing everything I can, but this world just isn't
normal.

1429
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,220
Things never go as planned.

1430
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:30,960
What about you?

1431
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,880
Yeah, you really are different from the others around here.

1432
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:35,640
Why am I here, you ask?

1433
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,140
Yeah, that's literally what I said.

1434
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,680
Moon taunted.

1435
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:42,560
Moving time, dude.

1436
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:47,100
Well, there's a vicious shark in this city, and I saw him
holding the third tablet shard.

1437
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:51,180
So I found that maybe with a mortar?

1438
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,880
Oh my god, we could take down the shark.

1439
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:58,700
But it seems you'll need four parts to complete the weapon.

1440
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,640
Go down to go, yo.

1441
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,680
So you can find all four...

1442
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,200
Oh, so could you find all four parts of the weapon for me?

1443
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,660
Oh, okay.

1444
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:08,400
Awesome.

1445
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,340
That's not a lizard.

1446
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:12,400
It looks like a lizard.

1447
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,300
Doesn't look like a shark.

1448
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:16,280
I'll tell you that.

1449
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:20,330
Oh, oops.

1450
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:28,130
I'm really hoping that the requests aren't going to be
like...

1451
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:31,110
Okay, I need this fish from this area.

1452
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:33,810
And I need you to go get this fish from this area, you know?

1453
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:37,030
And, like, it's a whole huge, terrible fetch quest.

1454
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:39,450
Alright, let's go to this guy first.

1455
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:40,870
Um...

1456
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:44,890
But I have a feeling, I have an inkling that it's going to
be that way.

1457
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:49,450
Wait, this is the first guy that we just spoke to.

1458
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:50,750
Do you need something more?

1459
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,380
Probably safe to assume so.

1460
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,160
Probably.

1461
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:00,560
I wonder if I can fast travel with fish.

1462
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:01,800
Wait, he's gone.

1463
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:03,900
Is he up here?

1464
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:04,340
On top?

1465
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:05,720
How do I get up?

1466
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,660
How do I get up there?

1467
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:12,520
Hello?

1468
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,120
How do I enter your...

1469
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,140
refined establishment.

1470
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,200
Literally nobody up here!

1471
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:30,680
Okay, never mind.

1472
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,300
Whatever happened to the fish in the laundromat?

1473
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:38,700
That's a great question.

1474
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,460
Alright, let's go to this guy first then, I suppose.

1475
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,580
I am gonna save real quick, though.

1476
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,140
Alright.

1477
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,080
Drive.

1478
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,920
This guy here.

1479
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,040
Hello, hello, hello!

1480
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:11,870
Is that a nice little park?

1481
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:19,310
She sells seashells by the seashore.

1482
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,730
Place fish.

1483
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:24,470
Hello!

1484
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:25,050
Pee!

1485
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:28,210
Pee!

1486
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:31,650
Hurry the hell up!

1487
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:32,410
Get to work!

1488
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:34,070
I need an orfish!

1489
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:37,610
Oh, we have not gotten orfish yet, so...

1490
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:41,010
If you keep the boat moving and be looking around, it won't
come at you.

1491
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,590
Once you find it on the sonar, don't look towards it.

1492
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:44,690
Let it get close.

1493
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:47,650
Once it's close enough, stab its face.

1494
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:50,390
It's fast as hell, but it won't take the bait.

1495
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,710
Just a sicko that attacks people.

1496
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:53,330
Okay.

1497
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:57,230
A sicko, a real sicko.

1498
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,730
I don't think orfish are aggressive, are they?

1499
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:06,690
Watch the sonar carefully.

1500
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:07,410
Let it get close.

1501
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,390
Close enough that it pokes its head out of the water.

1502
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:10,610
But don't let it get too close.

1503
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:11,850
or it'll bite your ass.

1504
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:15,250
And in that case, you guessed it, your ass is gone.

1505
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:18,110
No, that's all I have.

1506
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:20,190
So don't die.

1507
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:21,230
Bring me the orfish.

1508
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:24,470
Okay, okay.

1509
01:37:24,810 --> 01:37:26,790
It seems it's stuff in this area then.

1510
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:31,210
At least for now, because we have not caught an orfish
before.

1511
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:32,770
So that's good.

1512
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:33,470
That's good to know.

1513
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:38,510
How do I know what the orfish is like on the radar, though?

1514
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:40,390
Is my question.

1515
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:44,890
Maybe we should get the updated radar that's faster, right?

1516
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:46,590
Right?

1517
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:49,270
Maternity.

1518
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:53,870
I wonder if I can go into these places.

1519
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:55,550
Like the red area?

1520
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:59,850
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1521
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:01,370
Oh.

1522
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:02,050
Oh, oh, oh!

1523
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:04,370
My ass is grass!

1524
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:09,230
We found him?

1525
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:22,750
He's gone?

1526
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:27,050
Okay, hold on.

1527
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:29,310
He went this way for sure.

1528
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:33,630
I might have to upgrade my sonar for this.

1529
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:35,070
Oh, oh, oh.

1530
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,320
I'm not looking.

1531
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,040
He's gone again.

1532
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,940
No, he's there.

1533
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,140
I'm not looking at you.

1534
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,040
He's over there.

1535
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:01,750
Oh, shoot!

1536
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:05,030
What?

1537
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:06,790
That did so little damage.

1538
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:09,830
No way!

1539
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:11,110
Okay.

1540
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:14,770
Oh, okay.

1541
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:16,590
Getting it in the face really does help.

1542
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:18,110
I couldn't tell what it looked like, though.

1543
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:18,830
That's kind of sad.

1544
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:20,570
I want to see what it looks like.

1545
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:22,530
It looks like it has a lady head.

1546
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:31,140
Oh!

1547
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,040
Alright, alright.

1548
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,180
All right, all right.

1549
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,520
This isn't so bad.

1550
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,680
This isn't so bad.

1551
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:41,680
Oh, we got her!

1552
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,020
Okay.

1553
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:45,920
Nice.

1554
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,980
Time for a boss fight.

1555
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:49,100
That was easy.

1556
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,920
I want to see it, though.

1557
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:06,350
I really was trying to get my ass.

1558
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,770
Took you long enough.

1559
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:13,230
Thank you.

1560
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:14,290
I got...

1561
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:15,410
Oh, I got the bullet.

1562
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:16,610
Let's go.

1563
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,790
Yeah, it was an orfish, though, obviously.

1564
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:28,030
Iku nagai from Toho Project.

1565
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:29,290
I see it with the ribbons.

1566
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:33,150
Yeah, bullet.

1567
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,770
Big bullet.

1568
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:36,530
Alright.

1569
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:38,850
is taken care of.

1570
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:40,090
Let's go to this one next.

1571
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:46,070
Can I sneak through here?

1572
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:46,510
Yes.

1573
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:48,270
Why so?

1574
01:40:54,390 --> 01:40:55,710
Right over here.

1575
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:57,630
I want to see the shark from up here.

1576
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:06,210
Oh, you can see him!

1577
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:11,530
What is he doing up there?

1578
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:13,290
Oh.

1579
01:41:13,970 --> 01:41:14,530
Raiden?

1580
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:16,430
Oh my gosh, you guys!

1581
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:18,630
Metal Gear Solid!

1582
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:19,410
Rising!

1583
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:22,050
I mean, not this, oh wait, Metal Gear Rising!

1584
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:27,370
Ryden is here in the...

1585
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:27,690
Wow!

1586
01:41:28,070 --> 01:41:30,210
Look at the dumpy on this guy.

1587
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:31,670
Konkura!

1588
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:34,530
I'm Kurana!

1589
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:38,590
So you're the new guy.

1590
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:40,750
I want you to gather some swordfish here now.

1591
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:42,530
Swordfish are super fast.

1592
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:43,830
Use boost to chase them down.

1593
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:44,670
That's your best bet.

1594
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:48,550
When it tries to escape, it usually just circles around the
area, so it shouldn't be too hard.

1595
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:52,030
The moment you get close, it'll run away quick.

1596
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:54,230
It'll test your harpooning skill for sure.

1597
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:55,570
Wait, how many do I need?

1598
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:58,410
Five!

1599
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:00,210
Five of them!

1600
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:01,650
Five of them!

1601
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:03,130
Five!

1602
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:05,590
Okay.

1603
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,340
What do they look like?

1604
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,650
Five of them.

1605
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:26,370
I don't see anything in like the...

1606
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:28,070
Wow!

1607
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:29,350
I wonder how close we can get.

1608
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,070
Wait, let me save.

1609
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:41,230
I don't know why I save when I know it's gonna like take us
back to wherever it does, but you know what I mean.

1610
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:42,550
The main island.

1611
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:43,410
Wow!

1612
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:51,260
It looks so stupid.

1613
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,040
Yeah, that is a goblin shark now, isn't it?

1614
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:06,210
I don't see any fish on the sonar.

1615
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:18,980
at all maybe over here i just like how he's like up top is
that them oh that's definitely them okay

1616
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:41,130
it's really hard to shoot wow see my i aim one way and my
thing goes another i think i have to like be next to them

1617
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:45,950
This is tough.

1618
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:51,350
Why does it go sideways like that?

1619
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:52,450
You see it?

1620
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,100
Ah!

1621
01:43:58,760 --> 01:43:59,080
I got

1622
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:03,740
gold.

1623
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,340
He's got...

1624
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:06,180
That's...

1625
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:07,160
He's got some...

1626
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,520
He's got a long man.

1627
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:10,480
Okay.

1628
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:14,320
I might need to fill up for this one.

1629
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,180
For this task.

1630
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:18,840
Hey!

1631
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,440
I mean, I might need to go fill up first.

1632
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,380
Oh yeah, my fuel is really low.

1633
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,640
Okay, let's go do that first.

1634
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:42,970
It's over there.

1635
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:44,570
Low fuel!

1636
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:45,950
Oh no, no, no!

1637
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:49,810
We're okay, we'll make it.

1638
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:57,520
I wish I had some cash though to...

1639
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:05,120
I mean, I have a little bit of surplus, but...

1640
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:05,400
Okay.

1641
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,140
Let's go get our dino!

1642
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,540
I feel like that swordfish is based on someone, but I don't
know who.

1643
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:18,280
Now who could it be based on?

1644
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,100
Are you projecting?

1645
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:34,040
Right in here.

1646
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:41,740
Wait, did they just go this way?

1647
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:52,000
I lost him.

1648
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:54,960
What the heck?

1649
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:57,190
Why did my harpoon go all the way that way?

1650
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:00,860
Ugh.

1651
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:02,600
Oh, shoot.

1652
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:03,940
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1653
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:11,440
Ugh, I was hoping.

1654
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,260
It's easier in here, I think.

1655
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:17,620
Ha!

1656
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:18,840
What?

1657
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:19,780
I've already had fuel!

1658
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,200
No, please!

1659
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,060
This is so hard!

1660
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,480
I can't shoot straight!

1661
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:32,960
Please!

1662
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:36,680
Ah, I got one!

1663
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,420
Okay, we got one.

1664
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:38,880
Yay!

1665
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,220
This one's tough.

1666
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:50,590
What happened to your eagle eyes?

1667
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,250
I'm a ghost!

1668
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:52,170
What are you talking about?

1669
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:54,470
I've never been an eagle ever before in my afterlife.

1670
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,190
Alright, number two.

1671
01:46:59,290 --> 01:46:59,650
Save.

1672
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:02,190
Oh, I didn't mean to make a new one, but whatever.

1673
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:05,810
Um, I feel like I need to go get some feed.

1674
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,410
for money.

1675
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:11,890
I can't keep fueling up like this, you know?

1676
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:15,910
Let's, before, okay, let's try a different guy.

1677
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:20,790
Let's just go check out someone else and see what they want,
you know?

1678
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:33,740
We'll come back to that one.

1679
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:38,600
Oh my gosh!

1680
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,420
Wait, does that just say Village Vanguard?

1681
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:40,800
Oops.

1682
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:41,280
Oh.

1683
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:42,440
It does!

1684
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,340
Oh my Gosh, a village vanguard!

1685
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,340
What the heck?

1686
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,320
It's not even like a parody.

1687
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:51,220
It's just straight up village vanguard.

1688
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,200
I love this store.

1689
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:56,040
It's like...

1690
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,440
It's the exciting bookstore.

1691
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:02,820
A lot of idol lives happen here.

1692
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:07,160
You became an eagle briefly, and then you pulled a Huey
acrylic suit.

1693
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,300
Shut up.

1694
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:13,520
Yeah, it's a place in Japan.

1695
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:22,140
a lot of idols perform here because they have like well the
one in shibuya has a stage so if you go um you might be able

1696
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:30,640
to catch a show but it's uh usually you have to like buy the
single for the idols there they do it to like promote a new

1697
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:38,660
album or single or something um but it's a very cool store
in general they have a lot of interesting stuff wow i didn't

1698
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,280

1706
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,160
It's not the guys that are glowing, is it?

1707
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:50,160
Are those the bait?

1708
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,200
Oh, oh, wow.

1709
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:58,160
It's a jellyfish.

1710
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:03,140
Uh...

1711
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,520
I don't know where I'd see one, but let's just...

1712
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:06,940
Whoop!

1713
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:13,960
Piranha!

1714
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,140
Piranha!

1715
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:22,210
I'm scared of this one.

1716
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:24,030
How much are they worth?

1717
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:24,690
I don't know.

1718
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:28,250
Okay.

1719
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:34,990
How much are the jellies worth?

1720
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:36,590
True, I should grab a couple, right?

1721
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:37,550
And sell them?

1722
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:42,090
They're worth?

1723
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:44,150
Oh, okay.

1724
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:46,270
$1,000.

1725
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:49,090
$1,000, $1,000.

1726
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:49,810
$10,000.

1727
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:54,850
Yeah, I'll take these.

1728
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:59,350
I'll take these and we'll go get some gas.

1729
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:06,070
I'm afraid of getting spotted by a piranha now, though.

1730
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:16,520
Free money?

1731
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:18,220
Yeah, easy money, rather.

1732
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:19,720
Alright.

1733
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,280
Let's head back to...

1734
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:30,710
Maybe since I got two of the...

1735
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:33,870
Swordfish, I just try and do that one.

1736
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:35,750
Oh my gosh, wait, I'm scared.

1737
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:37,150
I think we'll make it.

1738
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:38,110
I think so.

1739
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,080
It ain't great though.

1740
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:47,820
I think we'll make it.

1741
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,280
Everybody survived?

1742
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:03,960
What do you got here?

1743
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,920
Oh, wait, can I have that?

1744
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,760
Can I have that?

1745
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:11,580
Ew.

1746
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,260
Hi, Mito.

1747
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:16,640
Hello!

1748
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,020
Okay.

1749
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:31,590
You know, maybe I have more money than I thought I did.

1750
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:32,110
But you know what?

1751
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:32,650
It's good.

1752
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:33,550
Just in case.

1753
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:34,090
You know what?

1754
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:38,330
Actually, if we want upgrades and stuff too.

1755
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:41,910
Upgrade.

1756
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:49,190
Maybe we do the bait range for the piranha.

1757
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:52,170
And...

1758
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:53,250
Harpoon gun!

1759
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:55,250
Wait, we really can get a Harpoon gun!

1760
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:56,110
Oh!

1761
01:52:56,110 --> 01:52:58,530
Upgrade Harpoon into Harpoon Garden.

1762
01:52:59,370 --> 01:52:59,970
Whoa!

1763
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:02,750
Oh, I just spent...

1764
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:05,930
We could get that.

1765
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:06,690
We could get that.

1766
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:07,470
We could get that.

1767
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:11,650
The Poon Garden.

1768
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:13,090
Yes.

1769
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:15,890
I'm just...

1770
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:18,650
I'm sorry, this boat speed goes up to seven now.

1771
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:20,570
What the heck?

1772
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:36,510
I know there probably has to be a achievement for getting
all of the upgrades and such but let's go back to this guy

1773
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:50,660
we will do the swordfish we will do the swordfish and then
i'll do the piranha don't call it that what someone else did

1774
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:55,760
in chat what is it bad what's it mean the

1775
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,900
gun would make swordfish easier i think so too

1776
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,600
Oh my god.

1777
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:16,320
I'm so not good at this.

1778
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,300
Where are you guys going?

1779
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,180
This way?

1780
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:26,060
I'm just following him real quick.

1781
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:30,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ha!

1782
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:33,320
Nice!

1783
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:37,580
Oh, my bad.

1784
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:38,300
My bad.

1785
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,400
Excellent shot.

01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,120
Thank you.

1787
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:49,300
I thought so too.

1788
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:55,040
Who needs a gun?

1789
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:08,010
Hopefully I can get one more before they disappear on me!

1790
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:10,770
They're all like together here.

1791
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:14,790
Oh, oh, there they are.

1792
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,580
Is getting hit?

1793
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,200
Oh, getting hit does lower my fuel.

1794
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,000
Oh, I just noticed.

1795
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:35,700

1796
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:36,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

Hello.

1833
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:13,610
At last, their blood is all I need.

1834
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:14,910

01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,160
Tiny shrines, so cute.

1839
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:57,960
He really is just, like, riding.

1840
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:00,880
He's riding.

1841
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:04,060
Oh, oh, oh, there's a shell here.

1842
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:05,980
I would have missed it.

1843
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:09,460
Wait.

1844
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,820
Oh, oh, they're already attached.

1845
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:13,240
How convenient is that?

1846
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:14,360
Am I doing good?

1847
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,660
I'm doing everything I can.

1848
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:21,120
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B.

1849
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,080
Let's go, yo.

1850
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:22,540
Okay.

1851
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:25,300
Let's go.

1852
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:26,560
Piranha.

1853
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:32,500
I'm half-fuel.

1854
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,300
Let's go try the Piranha first.

1855
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:41,080
Maybe we can see what happens.

1856
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:46,860
I am cannibal.

1857
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,380
Cannibal, cannibal, cannibal.

1858
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:54,060
I am cannibal.

1859
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,240
Uncheck.

1860
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,160
Oh, there's this guy right here.

1861
02:00:58,260 --> 02:00:59,140
He's pretty close.

1862
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:00,840
Let's check him out first.

1863
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:06,160
Cannibal, cannibal, cannibal!

1864
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,370
Can I hop this fence?

1865
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:13,330
Hoi!

1866
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:17,750
Hi, Doru!

1867
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:20,050
Wait, her outfit's so cute!

1868
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:23,130
What do you, okay, zero out of five.

1869
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:23,850
What do you need?

1870
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:25,470
Kon Yuri.

1871
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,050
I'm Yulia.

1872
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:29,030
You'll help me, right?

1873
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:29,750
Nice.

1874
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:30,830
Looking forward to it.

1875
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:36,130
These mermaids are really good for my odd eyes.

1876
02:01:36,650 --> 02:01:38,630
I want you to catch five and bring them here.

1877
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:41,330
They're transparent unless they're hit by light.

1878
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:42,490
They're also violent.

1879
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:43,830
One climbs onto your boat.

1880
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:46,250
When you don't take it down in time, it'll kill you.

1881
02:01:46,990 --> 02:01:50,190
You can't catch it while it's stuck on the boat, so grab it
before it gets on.

1882
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:50,890
Oh, shoot.

1883
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:54,790
I just got here and you're thinking about cannibals.

1884
02:01:54,970 --> 02:01:56,330
Do we need to hide another body?

1885
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:59,470
Best of luck, but don't worry.

1886
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:01,110
If you die, I'll remember your face.

1887
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:03,630
Okay.

1888
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:09,570
So I can't let it get on my boat, or else I die.

1889
02:02:10,450 --> 02:02:12,770
And I can't see them unless I have a really bright light.

1890
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:14,690
Like this.

1891
02:02:16,290 --> 02:02:18,070
They probably make a sound, probably.

1892
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:22,490
I'm scared.

1893
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:23,610
What if they gang up on me?

1894
02:02:27,330 --> 02:02:28,010
Oh, oh.

1895
02:02:29,370 --> 02:02:29,730
Uh.

1896
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:31,690
The sonar says.

1897
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:47,200
Did I get it?

1898
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:49,100
Wait.

1899
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:55,700
Ah!

1900
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:00,990
I'm still trying to...

1901
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:03,870
Wait!

1902
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:04,950
I'm so confused!

1903
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,550
How am I not getting them?

1904
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:07,990
How am I not reeling them in?

1905
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:14,690
I'm so confused.

1906
02:03:15,230 --> 02:03:16,450
It is kind of scary though.

1907
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:23,690
Is it because they're touching my boat?

1908
02:03:26,030 --> 02:03:27,610
Oh, that's so lame.

1909
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:31,090
Ew, that's so lame.

1910
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:39,940
So I have to get them, like, far away.

1911
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:53,310
Oh my god.

1912
02:03:53,590 --> 02:03:54,630
I can't even reach it.

1913
02:03:55,410 --> 02:03:57,030
Wait, this is bad.

1914
02:03:57,910 --> 02:03:58,670
Okay, here we go.

1915
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:00,050
And then...

1916
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:04,320
Ah!

1917
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:05,120
Oh!

1918
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:14,380
Uh-oh, wait, uh-oh, wait, uh-oh, wait, uh-oh, let's leave.

1919
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,520
Did you see how much these guys are worth?

1920
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:34,900
Nice.

1921
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:38,100
Face down, so...

1922
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,160
Uh...

1923
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:42,280
With respect.

1924
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:44,880
So respectful.

1925
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:46,900
That's the word I was looking for.

1926
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:52,080
I'm trying to figure out if I want to keep going or if I...

1927
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:54,240
Like, is that one right there?

1928
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:57,400
Oh, that's a jellyfish.

1929
02:04:58,340 --> 02:04:58,820
Just kidding.

1930
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:09,520
Sheila saw the anglerfish from Outer Wilds and said, What if
they were hot?

1931
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,120
Yeah, exactly.

1932
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:13,100
Okay.

1933
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:14,920
Oh, there's a couple.

1934
02:05:23,170 --> 02:05:23,530
Okay.

1935
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:30,400
This is where it's good to have the fast...

1936
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:32,420
speed for the...

1937
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,980
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1938
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,000
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1939
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:40,780
Okay.

1940
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:41,980
Oh, we need to go.

1941
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:42,980
We need to go now.

1942
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:46,520
There was another one coming at me.

1943
02:05:48,260 --> 02:05:49,600
There was another one coming at me.

1944
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:49,860
Okay.

1945
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:50,840
Alright, alright.

1946
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:53,880
Yeah, the real speed is like saving my booty for real.

1947
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:54,600
Ha!

1948
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:55,780
Get up for real!

1949
02:06:05,030 --> 02:06:06,070
They're so freaky.

1950
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:10,820
They're like sardines!

1951
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:12,140
Ugh.

1952
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:14,280
Okay.

1953
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:20,760
Alright.

1954
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:22,460
Alright.

1955
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,580
Oh, they're so close.

1956
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,340
Where are you?

1957
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:32,800
Where are you?

1958
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,440
Oh, there you are.

1959
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,480
Heya!

1960
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:39,620
Nice.

1961
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:42,680
And that man should be just one more?

1962
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:48,220
I see...

1963
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:53,210
No!

1964
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:55,650
How did you get there so fast?

1965
02:07:00,130 --> 02:07:02,030
I see one on my radar.

1966
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:04,230
Oh, they're coming for me.

1967
02:07:05,090 --> 02:07:05,970
They're coming for me.

1968
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:08,890
Scary.

1969
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:10,730
It is pretty freaky.

1970
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:11,570
I'm not gonna lie.

1971
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:13,530
Oh my gosh, how?

1972
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:24,080
Back it up.

1973
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:24,960
Back it up.

1974
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:28,540
Maybe I can get it in time.

1975
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:30,420
Yay!

1976
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:32,460
Nice.

1977
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:34,540
Alright.

1978
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:43,650
Nice.

1979
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,660
This one was probably...

1980
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:50,520
Well, actually, I think the first one was the easiest.

1981
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:53,040
With the orfish.

1982
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,340
This one wasn't bad, though.

1983
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:55,180
It was just a little freaky.

1984
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:58,000
So he managed to stay alive.

1985
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:00,160
I can feel my eyes.

1986
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:01,420
settling down already.

1987
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:03,420
What does that mean?

1988
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:06,440
Okay!

1989
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:09,180
I feel like, though, we should grab some mermaids.

1990
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:11,260
For money.

1991
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:13,860
No?

1992
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:17,500
Maybe we should grab some mermaids for money.

1993
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,940
I should go fuel up, though, before we do the piranhas.

1994
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:25,800
I don't even know what the piranha challenge is like, so it
could be really brutal.

1995
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:27,700
It could be really easy.

1996
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:29,500
Who knows?

1997
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,120
Where the harpoon gone?

1998
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:36,600
Yeah, yeah, I'm turning around.

1999
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:45,550
40,000 yen a pop is cash money.

2000
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:47,050
It's so true.

2001
02:08:48,650 --> 02:08:50,070
These guys do scare me, though.

2002
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,640
Dang it.

2003
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:07,480
Oh, they're all coming.

2004
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,140
Do you see them?

2005
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:09,780
Holy cow, there's three of them.

2006
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:14,060
There's sea cows.

2007
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:17,160
Wait, I think I'm getting attacked.

2008
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:18,420
I think I'm getting ambushed.

2009
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:29,320
I think I need to go I think I I think we'll just grab one
for now Take you in my arms YouTube don't get mad at me.

2010
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:29,980
It's art

2011
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:37,040
Coward did you see how many there were?

2012
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,500
Did you see how many there were?

2013
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:52,680
You can see a little bit of nip I'll move over I'll show
you.

2014
02:10:06,450 --> 02:10:08,030
If I hold it, wait.

2015
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:11,470
Wow, what is this model that they got?

2016
02:10:11,790 --> 02:10:12,570
For real though.

2017
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:14,190
Oh, that's my hat.

2018
02:10:19,150 --> 02:10:20,230
That's my hat.

2019
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:21,690
Look at this!

2020
02:10:23,710 --> 02:10:25,150
It's so detailed!

2021
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:28,230
I think I could see everything.

2022
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:32,910
YouTube, don't get mad at me.

2023
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:33,210
It's awesome.

2024
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:33,450
Art.

2025
02:10:34,450 --> 02:10:35,470
Artistic nudity.

2026
02:10:36,570 --> 02:10:37,930
And it's also a fish.

2027
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:40,410
Aisha.

2028
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:47,910
If we got like two more, we would be able to get the gun.

2029
02:10:48,910 --> 02:10:49,350
Crazy.

2030
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:53,170
Got that areola.

Yes, she do.

2033
02:10:59,580 --> 02:10:59,980
All right.

2034
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,260
Fuel up.

2035
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:11,850
Off we go to the piranha.

2036
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:25,970

They must not be so difficult to get if we have to get 20 of
them.

2042
02:12:06,770 --> 02:12:08,830
I forgot it was 20 of them.

2043
02:12:09,570 --> 02:12:10,790
That's so many.

2044
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:14,110
That's so many.

2045
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:15,130
Oops.

2046
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:16,290
How could you miss?

2047
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:18,150
This guy doesn't even move.

2048
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:29,880
Peanut butter jelly time.

2049
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:32,820

02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,240
Let's just go in here or something.

2055
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:14,520
Did I lose one?

2056
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:25,520
Oh, oh, they're here!

2057
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:27,860
Oh, they're going over there!

2058
02:13:35,290 --> 02:13:35,710
Oh!

2059
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:36,510

2060
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:37,230
Oh my god.

2061
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:37,550
Oh,

2062
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:50,190
they come in, like, hordes.

2063
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:53,730
Wait, why are you chomping?

2064
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:00,910
Beto, this!

2065
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:06,390
How many do I have?

2066
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:17,510
Is that what they mean by the bait?

2067
02:14:19,130 --> 02:14:23,310
I think one fell out because I saw, like, some bait...

2068
02:14:24,630 --> 02:14:26,150
Oh, he's still chomp-chompin.

2069
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:30,170
I saw some bait, like, that looked like it fell into the
water.

2070
02:14:38,070 --> 02:14:38,550
Okay.

2071
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:41,590
This is...

2072
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:43,550
It's awkward, but it's doable.

2073
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:48,010
Yeah, they went for it.

2074
02:14:48,070 --> 02:14:48,970
They went crazy.

2075
02:14:50,530 --> 02:14:51,350
So funny.

2076
02:14:52,130 --> 02:14:52,870
Okay, six.

2077
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:54,230
Ah, 20.

2078
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:56,870
Oof.

2079
02:14:57,870 --> 02:14:57,910
Oof.

2080
02:14:58,590 --> 02:14:58,650
Oof.

2081
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:01,990
I'm gonna try this area again, though.

2082
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:03,170
It seems not bad.

2083
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:06,930
It seems they'll cut.

2084
02:15:07,010 --> 02:15:07,550
Oh, I see.

2085
02:15:07,690 --> 02:15:07,970
I see.

2086
02:15:08,770 --> 02:15:09,770
It's on the radar.

2087
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:23,840
Oh no, don't look at me.

2088
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:26,940
Oh, shoot.

2089
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:35,020
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2090
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:37,500
Don't chomp, chomp on me.

2091
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:39,240
Nice.

2092
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,200
Still got him.

2093
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:46,520
I'm like, it looks like I'm dropping multiple, but I don't
think I am.

2094
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,640
Have we found the one piece before Luffy and become queen of
the pirate Madoes?

2095
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:56,360
Is that, is that one of, I'm, is that one of my goals?

2096
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:07,360
Let's pull up right there.

2097
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:11,960
Place it in my fish.

2098
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:18,160
All right, we're officially, oh, we're halfway there.

2099
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:23,880
Oh, do I want to go get more?

2100
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,700
Yes, just in case.

2101
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:28,460
I think I will.

2102
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:31,660
Hold on, I'm going to get some jellies for cash.

2103
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:46,180
money I'm gonna get some jellies for cash money and also
because I feel if they attack me I will survive but I might

2104
02:16:46,180 --> 02:17:01,280
run out of I might run out of gas or rather I won't have
enough gas to get back to the gas station so we'll do that I

2105
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:05,020
think I lost my bait again.

2106
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:08,820
It rolls out so quickly.

2107
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,660
It rolls out so fast.

2108
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:19,600
My bait fell off.

2109
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,060
What happens if you run out of gas?

2110
02:17:23,460 --> 02:17:24,580
You lose...

2111
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:26,520
It only happened to me in the demo.

2112
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:31,620
Actually, the main game is so much more forgiving than how
the demo worked.

2113
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:38,200
But if you run out, you, if anything that you had on your
boat, you lose.

2114
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:45,540
Um, and, uh, I think you just teleported back here.

2115
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:47,360
I'm pretty sure.

2116
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:50,780
All right, baby!

2117
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:53,260
There it is.

2118
02:17:57,240 --> 02:17:58,040
I lost!

2119
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:58,760
We

2120
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:06,700
saved the money.

2121
02:18:07,880 --> 02:18:08,660
We saved the money.

2122
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:09,000
Shop.

2123
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:20,820
it's kind of funny because you like look at this guy and
you're just like is he a scary fish man or is he chilla's

2124
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:36,880
chilla chilla's art model it could very be one it could be
both it could be anything is it jank of game or real scary

2125
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:48,260

2129
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:22,740
Gorilla stream.

2130
02:19:23,420 --> 02:19:24,380
Unga bunga!

2131
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:25,720
Unga bunga!

2132
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:27,820
I thought this was a game about fish.

2133
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,040
What are you talking about?

2134
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:31,500
We're literally in the jungles of sunken Tokyo.

2135
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:33,520
Okay.

2136
02:19:41,290 --> 02:19:42,190
They're coming.

2137
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:43,650
They're coming!

2138
02:19:55,390 --> 02:19:55,910
Yes.

2139
02:19:57,350 --> 02:19:58,190
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

2140
02:19:58,610 --> 02:19:59,270
Uh-oh, uh-oh, they're chomping.

2141
02:19:59,410 --> 02:19:59,890
They're chomping, chomping.

2142
02:20:00,190 --> 02:20:01,210
Uh-oh, chomping time!

2143
02:20:02,830 --> 02:20:03,630
Where'd he go?

2144
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:06,950
Oh, I'm still holding him.

2145
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:09,650
I missed the last guy.

2146
02:20:10,590 --> 02:20:11,230
That's too bad.

2147
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:15,740
The jungles of Japan.

2148
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,520
The concrete jungles.

2149
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:21,460
It's a concrete jungle.

2150
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:23,800
It's a concrete jungle.

2151
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:28,660
Oh, we're so close.

2152
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:33,980
How?

2153
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:34,700
Oh, they're 10,000.

2154
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Okay.

2155
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:36,500
Just two more!

2156
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:37,980
Just two more!

2157
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:40,640
Yahoo!

2158
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:42,360
Woo!

2159
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:42,740
Woo!

2160
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,340
Shut up!

2161
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:51,220
Wait a second, I just realized this too!

2162
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:54,760
That character is Obakenu!

2163
02:20:55,980 --> 02:20:57,740
These are Obakenu plushies.

2164
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:59,540
Oh, they're so cute!

2165
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:06,540

2175
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:45,260
Oh, I thought I lost all of my fish.

2176
02:22:45,860 --> 02:22:47,440
I was about to be like, no freaking way.

2177
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:50,920
I know I'm like zooming through here, but come on.

2178
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:53,660
I want the harpoon gun.

2179
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:57,440
I want the harpoon.

2180
02:22:57,560 --> 02:22:59,420
I don't know if I need the harpoon gun.

2181
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:01,740
But I want the harpoon gun.

2182
02:23:06,690 --> 02:23:08,130
I'm going a little bit slower.

2183
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:14,860
No eyes.

2184
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:15,560
No hands.

2185
02:23:16,400 --> 02:23:16,960
No eyes.

2186
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:17,500
No hands.

2187
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:18,460
No hands.

2188
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:24,100
Okay, I think they're all right.

2189
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:30,350
I think they're okay.

2190
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:33,950
They're okay.

2191
02:23:36,170 --> 02:23:37,350
Do piranhas taste good?

2192
02:23:37,850 --> 02:23:38,730
How do they taste?

2193
02:23:39,470 --> 02:23:39,850
I don't know.

2194
02:23:39,930 --> 02:23:41,350
Has anyone eaten piranhas before?

2195
02:23:43,550 --> 02:23:45,450
Anybody with some knowledge?

2196
02:23:48,450 --> 02:24:04,090
Are you going to have a little break and dinner next stream
if I have time I will try if I have time wait oh oh I didn't

2197
02:24:04,090 --> 02:24:14,090
mean to sorry my bad I have a butterfingers oh the gun

2198
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:20,440
we got the gun we got the

2199
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:27,580
gun watch this be completely useless now that'd be so funny?

2200
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,180
That would be so funny.

2201
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:35,600
If I don't need it at all.

2202
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:41,460
Um, yeah.

2203
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,500
I mean, I can't upgrade anything else anyway.

2204
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:46,000
Oh wait, do I have enough money to refuel?

2205
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:48,820
Oh shoot, I just realized.

2206
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:52,900
Oh yeah, we're totally good.

2207
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,980
Okay, let's go to the tower.

2208
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:02,700
What the heck is wrong with you guys?

2209
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:05,300
You guys crave more blood than me, I think.

2210
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:08,560
Let's blow up that shark!

2211
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:15,860
I hope it's not like a defense thing where it's like, while
I'm setting this up, you...

2212
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:16,840
You...

2213
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:17,160
Hello?

2214
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,160
You defend me.

2215
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:21,040
Oh!

2216
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:23,080
You found all four parts!

2217
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:23,640
Thank you!

2218
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:26,300
This should let us take the shark down.

2219
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:27,740
That shark looks tough.

2220
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:28,560
It's not normal.

2221
02:25:28,780 --> 02:25:29,380
even close.

2222
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:31,060
Then again, neither are we.

2223
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:33,580
Yeah, we're the special fish.

2224
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:36,580
Apparently, there's a person inside that shark's mouth.

2225
02:25:37,140 --> 02:25:38,480
Wait, oh, we're aiming.

2226
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:44,340
Okay, I thought we were trying to not aim for the person in
their mouth, but we do want the person in their mouth.

2227
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:46,760
Hitting the shark itself doesn't seem to do anything.

2228
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:49,920
We've got what we need.

2229
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:50,720
Let's finish this.

2230
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,680
I left the weapon on the top of the tower so you can use it
right away.

2231
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:54,700
I wish you the best of luck.

2232
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,720
Don't forget to take what the shark is carrying.

2233
02:25:58,780 --> 02:26:00,420
Oh, I have to do the work also?

2234
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:01,480
Okay, that's fine.

2235
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:06,360
Oh, now we get to climb it.

2236
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:10,480
I hope nobody has a fear of heights.

2237
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:12,300
What a thrill.

2238
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:19,060
With darkness and silence through the night.

2239
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:21,800
What a thrill.

2240
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:27,280
I'm searching and I'll melt into you.

2241
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:35,360
What a fi- Oh, oh my god, it's ready.

2242
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:42,720
Oh my god, it's ready.

2243
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:47,900
Oh.

2244
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:06,380
Maybe I shot it out of the sky, and now I do have to aim.

2245
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:07,120
You know what I mean?

2246
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:08,780
Maybe I do have to fight it still.

2247
02:27:13,980 --> 02:27:17,020
That's probably what it is, is now he's swimming around.

2248
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:23,030
It's a real a while.

2249
02:27:25,430 --> 02:27:26,310
Can I just jump?

2250
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:28,990
Oh, thank goodness.

2251
02:27:35,570 --> 02:27:37,150
Oh, okay, okay.

2252
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:39,570
Don't forget to collect what he's saving.

2253
02:27:40,150 --> 02:27:40,930
Or what he's...

2254
02:27:40,930 --> 02:27:42,530
No, I'm saving.

2255
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:43,270
Sorry, wait.

2256
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:44,990
Collect what he's holding.

2257
02:28:04,870 --> 02:28:07,570
That makes sense, I think.

2258
02:28:10,490 --> 02:28:11,110
Where is he?

2259
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:22,860
Maybe I should have upgraded my sonar.

2260
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:24,240
He's gone already.

2261
02:28:26,020 --> 02:28:27,160
He seems really fast.

2262
02:28:33,790 --> 02:28:35,030
The hunt begins.

2263
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:35,650
Oh!

2264
02:28:37,930 --> 02:28:38,970
Oh, no,

2265
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:43,780
not...

2266
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:44,500
I don't even think it...

2267
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,820
Oh, it is picking up those guys.

2268
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:48,560
Oh.

2269
02:28:48,580 --> 02:28:49,580
No, not you!

2270
02:28:56,880 --> 02:28:59,680
Supreme, so you're by!

2271
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:05,460
Wait a second.

2272
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:09,580
There's another thing over here.

2273
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:10,300
You see it?

2274
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:11,700
Also, there's like mountains.

2275
02:29:12,460 --> 02:29:13,180
Another gate.

2276
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:17,600
Oh, I don't like- wait!

2277
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,880
It's another gas station.

2278
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:33,300
Wait, I- Where am I?

2279
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:34,740
Oh no, I'm at the other side.

2280
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:37,880
What the?

2281
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,880
Oh look at that!

2282
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,040
That's handy.

2283
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:48,280
Oh, I've been going all the way back to the other side for
no reason!

2284
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:52,040
This has been here the whole time!

2285
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:56,200
I'm gonna set it as a marker so we don't forget about it.

2286
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:06,600
But to be fair, I was going back and selling things too,
so...

2287
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:10,500
Oh gosh, this fight, what am I, am I fighting the end?

2288
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:11,980
Like, what, what is this?

2289
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,160
It's so slow.

2290
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:20,120
I should have upgraded my sonar.

2291
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:26,140
Could he be anywhere?

2292
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:28,360
Are we saying anywhere, anywhere in this whole city?

2293
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:35,480
He's not gonna come after me at all?

2294
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:39,560
Oh!

2295
02:31:06,850 --> 02:31:09,030
Where's the person in your mouth?

2296
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:15,500
Hello?

2297
02:31:23,330 --> 02:31:24,630
Wait, I can't move.

2298
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:39,040
Turn around, please.

2299
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:40,660
Open wide.

2300
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:44,480
Oh my gosh.

2301
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:46,460
Wait, this is so stinky.

2302
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:54,280
I don't know the timing.

2303
02:31:58,060 --> 02:31:58,180
Oh,

2304
02:32:15,390 --> 02:32:17,070
he's holding me hostage again.

2305
02:32:17,950 --> 02:32:19,930
Oh, thank you.

2306
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:21,410
Maybe for me there.

2307
02:32:32,180 --> 02:32:33,580
Guys, I'm confused.

2308
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:42,700
Oh my gosh.

2309
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:46,060
I didn't know he was lunging twice.

2310
02:32:46,380 --> 02:32:47,920
Oh, I'm stuck on top of him.

2311
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:54,180
Please, can I, like, see your mouth or something?

2312
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:54,860
Oh.

2313
02:32:57,780 --> 02:32:58,980
Oh, I'm stuck again.

2314
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:02,180
He is making it so I can't move.

2315
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:04,240
Okay, where is he coming from?

2316
02:33:10,060 --> 02:33:12,220
I'm gonna go get more gas.

2317
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:41,740
Well, at least we have the gun, so we should do more damage,
right?

2318
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:45,480
Which is the idea.

2319
02:33:47,140 --> 02:33:48,200
Hopefully he stays there.

2320
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:50,780
Don't go anywhere, Shark!

2321
02:33:50,900 --> 02:33:52,120
I'm coming back for you!

2322
02:33:53,220 --> 02:33:55,020
It was a tactical retreat!

2323
02:34:00,670 --> 02:34:02,450
It was a tactical retreat!

2324
02:34:04,090 --> 02:34:04,870
I don't need to save.

2325
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:06,250
I didn't do any damage to him.

2326
02:34:07,310 --> 02:34:09,730
I saved right before we started the fight, actually.

2327
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:12,550
Are you still around here?

2328
02:34:13,490 --> 02:34:13,810
Hello?

2329
02:34:14,630 --> 02:34:15,450
Please say yes.

2330
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:19,310
Oh, yes, yes, yes, good, good.

2331
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:29,080
I don't know what an opening...

2332
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:29,340
Ah!

2333
02:34:32,660 --> 02:34:33,780
Oh, like that!

2334
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:36,220
Okay, okay.

2335
02:34:36,480 --> 02:34:36,860
Oh my god.

2336
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,040
Wait, what's happening to my boat?

2337
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:39,300
Oh my god, I'm stuck on him again.

2338
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:48,190
Oh, I'm stuck again.

2339
02:34:48,730 --> 02:34:49,490
I can't move.

2340
02:34:50,390 --> 02:34:51,150
I can't move.

2341
02:34:55,550 --> 02:34:56,910
Oh, I got him, though.

2342
02:34:57,450 --> 02:34:58,450
Oh, I got him, though.

2343
02:34:58,890 --> 02:34:59,230
Nice.

2344
02:35:01,350 --> 02:35:02,210
Oh, my gosh.

2345
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:02,910
Yes, yes, yes.

2346
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:06,170
Okay, now we're talking business.

2347
02:35:07,150 --> 02:35:07,610
Yeah, baby.

2348
02:35:14,590 --> 02:35:15,870
Are you gonna lift up your mouth?

2349
02:35:16,050 --> 02:35:16,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2350
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:18,650
Oh, shoot.

2351
02:35:18,810 --> 02:35:19,470
No, no, please.

2352
02:35:19,770 --> 02:35:20,010
Hold.

2353
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:20,650
Hold.

2354
02:35:24,790 --> 02:35:25,290
Hold!

2355
02:35:25,910 --> 02:35:26,500
Hold for me!

2356
02:35:30,970 --> 02:35:32,750
This is kind of goofy.

2357
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:43,120
Oh, here we go.

2358
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:45,260
I'm gonna try again and get him.

2359
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,260
Ah, I got him!

2360
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:49,700
Yes!

2361
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:51,140
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

2362
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:52,800
Yes, yes, yes.

2363
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:05,000
And now you open your mouth?

2364
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:08,820
Now you open your mouth?

2365
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:11,300
Open your mouth for me?

2366
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:14,280
Show me your little human body?

2367
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:18,540
Yeah!

2368
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:21,540
We're so close!

2369
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:23,660
Say ah!

2370
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:24,820
We heard the dentist?

2371
02:36:27,060 --> 02:36:28,420
Oh, I'm stuck again.

2372
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:34,480
This might be the last hit, actually, if I can get it.

2373
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:37,260
Ah!

2374
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:39,820
I jinxed myself.

2375
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:43,200
Where'd he go?

2376
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:44,540
Wait, where'd he go?

2377
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:46,180
Wait, where'd he go?

2378
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:47,020
No!

2379
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:47,780
Oh, okay.

2380
02:36:51,690 --> 02:36:52,930
That would have been so epic.

2381
02:36:53,270 --> 02:36:53,330
Okay.

2382
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:00,860
Where is he?

2383
02:37:03,060 --> 02:37:03,880
Oh no!

2384
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:05,340
My thing ran out.

2385
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:06,440
And...

2386
02:37:11,990 --> 02:37:13,330
Are you flying?

2387
02:37:15,210 --> 02:37:16,510
Oh, I attached it.

2388
02:37:16,830 --> 02:37:17,370
Oh, hello!

2389
02:37:20,170 --> 02:37:22,410
Oh, he's bowing.

2390
02:37:23,130 --> 02:37:25,390
Yes, do you accept this dance, my lady?

2391
02:37:29,230 --> 02:37:32,870
Place three tablet shards into Shrine Door near First
Island.

2392
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:38,840
How much is this guy going to sell for?

2393
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:43,960
This guy who's been terrorizing the city, apparently.

2394
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:47,320
Do I need to talk to you?

2395
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:48,980
She's gone.

2396
02:37:52,240 --> 02:38:01,960
he looks like uh what's his name from mouth washing oh save
good idea thank you what if we just not sell him what if we

2397
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:08,200
take him along for the ride for with us for eternity curly
yeah he looks like curly

2398
02:38:13,180 --> 02:38:20,660
one million yen you really need a bigger boat or do you just
need to give me Guys?

2399
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:23,560
Guys?

2400
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:24,680
Oh.

2401
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:29,360
Is everything okay?

2402
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:32,200
Are we all right?

2403
02:38:34,580 --> 02:38:36,540
That froze my entire computer.

2404
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:40,320
Everything just froze just now.

2405
02:38:41,940 --> 02:38:42,480
We're back?

2406
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:42,900
Okay.

2407
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:48,860
That was scary.

2408
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:50,920
Alright, Curly.

2409
02:38:51,240 --> 02:38:53,100
It's time for us to say goodbye.

2410
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:57,780
Oh, meet again.

2411
02:38:59,180 --> 02:39:01,020
Don't know where.

2412
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:03,680
Don't know where.

2413
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:07,600
But I know we'll meet again.

2414
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:10,840
A sunny day.

2415
02:39:14,950 --> 02:39:15,890
Caught a giant shark.

2416
02:39:16,830 --> 02:39:18,190
No way, you took that shark down!

2417
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:19,590
Poor bastard.

2418
02:39:20,190 --> 02:39:22,050
Maybe this really was the better ending for him.

2419
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:24,110
So you've gathered all three sharks.

2420
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:26,170
That means the tablet is complete.

2421
02:39:26,550 --> 02:39:28,710
I don't know whether to worry or feel relieved.

2422
02:39:30,030 --> 02:39:32,390
Where it points should be an island.

2423
02:39:33,770 --> 02:39:35,170
You'll have to go alone from here.

2424
02:39:35,690 --> 02:39:37,470
Go on if it's truly what you want.

2425
02:39:38,970 --> 02:39:40,430
How much does he sell for though?

2426
02:39:42,630 --> 02:39:44,170
It really is 1 million!

2427
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:55,620
That would have been an unfortunate time for the stream to
crash.

2428
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:57,500
But at least I just saved, right?

2429
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:58,900
Holy cow, imagine.

2430
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:00,680
1 million.

2431
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:01,600
Do we save him?

2432
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:03,560
I mean, do we sell him or do we bring him along with us?

2433
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:14,320
I kind of like him as like my my you know little buddy on
the back of my boat I don't know if I fast travel with him

2434
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:20,020
though you know if I fast travel will I lose it and then
lose out on the million

2435
02:40:24,170 --> 02:40:32,470
hold on we're saving and we're going somewhere else

2436
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:43,100
oh Let's go!

2437
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:44,320
Let's go!

2438
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:48,080
Our little buddy.

2439
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:55,780
He's so huge.

2440
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:59,080
He's so big!

2441
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:00,560
Alright.

2442
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:04,740
I know I'm half-fuel, but it's right here anyway, so why
not?

2443
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:13,560
Where'd the girl go?

2444
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:16,160
Insert.

2445
02:41:16,780 --> 02:41:17,220
Insert.

2446
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:25,160
Why is it making us out?

2447
02:41:25,220 --> 02:41:25,280
Oh.

2448
02:41:27,060 --> 02:41:29,380
Follow the light ahead.

2449
02:41:32,740 --> 02:41:33,940
More bells!

2450
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:35,300
Oh, come on, man.

2451
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:37,780
Is it that one that I saw?

2452
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:41,100
I think so.

2453
02:41:42,860 --> 02:41:43,280
Yeah.

2454
02:41:44,220 --> 02:41:45,720
Is that one that I saw?

2455
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:46,600
It is.

2456
02:41:46,600 --> 02:41:47,560
We gotta go back.

2457
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:50,240
What's happening?

2458
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:53,700
Oh, I think it...

2459
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:55,360
Was it the bells?

2460
02:41:58,580 --> 02:41:59,100
Oh!

2461
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:00,620
I have a bell on my...

2462
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:01,280
Oh.

2463
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:04,280
I have a bell on my thing now!

2464
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:09,320
Wait, what the hell?

2465
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:16,580
It's not back.

2466
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:21,280
heavy.

2467
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:22,620
It's not back heavy at all.

2468
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:22,980
It's not.

2469
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:23,240
It's not.

2470
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:23,700
I promise.

2471
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:25,900
Oh, let's refuel first.

2472
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:26,540
My bad.

2473
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:30,720
Actually, we can fast travel to that first area.

2474
02:42:31,780 --> 02:42:32,840
We can fast travel.

2475
02:42:38,860 --> 02:42:40,500
To ominous city back.

2476
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:43,660
Yes, I knew it.

2477
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:44,040
I knew it.

2478
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:44,420
I knew it.

2479
02:42:45,860 --> 02:42:46,540
Are we all here?

2480
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:47,140
Okay.

2481
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:47,720
All right.

2482
02:42:47,780 --> 02:42:48,580
Team's all here.

2483
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:52,160
Oh, sorry.

2484
02:42:52,300 --> 02:42:53,160
I meant to press this.

2485
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:54,420
and get this off my screen.

2486
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:54,840
There we go.

2487
02:42:56,560 --> 02:42:56,720
Okay.

2488
02:42:57,980 --> 02:42:59,620
The gang's all here.

2489
02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:03,160
Okay, save.

2490
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:05,200
Let's go, baby!

2491
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:05,600
Oh.

2492
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:07,340
What did I say?

2493
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:08,600
Oh.

2494
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:09,380
Oh.

2495
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:11,240
It looks like you're ready to go from here.

2496
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:12,580
Thanks for making it this far.

2497
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:15,160
I can finally see him again.

2498
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:17,780
I'll get on your boat with you.

2499
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:18,140
Iko.

2500
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:19,340
Just a little more.

2501
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:20,600
I'm so glad I met you.

2502
02:43:21,480 --> 02:43:21,920
Iko!

2503
02:43:22,060 --> 02:43:22,400
Iko!

2504
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:24,100
mind my buddy.

2505
02:43:26,400 --> 02:43:27,280
You like the decorations?

2506
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:28,760
So what is this now?

2507
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:32,720
What does this mean?

2508
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:36,260
I don't even have the right guys.

2509
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:37,540
I have to sell him.

2510
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:39,560
I don't have the right speed level.

2511
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:45,680
I think I have to sell him.

2512
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:50,660
So only yellow bell, no orple bell.

2513
02:43:55,090 --> 02:43:56,890
Maybe we can catch some jellyfish.

2514
02:43:59,930 --> 02:44:01,070
Touch some jellyfish.

2515
02:44:01,150 --> 02:44:01,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2516
02:44:02,010 --> 02:44:03,130
I'll catch some jellyfish.

2517
02:44:04,930 --> 02:44:08,310
I don't think it was so expensive for the next upgrade.

2518
02:44:08,590 --> 02:44:09,170
Oh, my God.

2519
02:44:12,290 --> 02:44:12,950
Don't mind me.

2520
02:44:13,230 --> 02:44:14,150
Also, don't mind the light.

2521
02:44:14,630 --> 02:44:15,530
Don't mind your shadows.

2522
02:44:19,230 --> 02:44:21,190
I don't like the way this gun sounds.

2523
02:44:21,410 --> 02:44:23,410
It's really loud and hurts my ears.

2524
02:44:25,570 --> 02:44:26,050
Wait a second.

2525
02:44:26,230 --> 02:44:26,890
I have an idea.

2526
02:44:38,970 --> 02:44:40,290
Was it 400k?

2527
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,580
These guys only give me...

2528
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:47,600
Oops.

2529
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:49,960
Not a lot.

2530
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:55,620
400k?

2531
02:44:56,700 --> 02:44:57,520
Oh, we're so...

2532
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:58,020
Oh, no.

2533
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:01,060
Uh...

2534
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:03,300
Maybe we can get a mermaid.

2535
02:45:11,080 --> 02:45:12,720
That's 40 mermaids!

2536
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:13,640
No, it's not.

2537
02:45:13,780 --> 02:45:15,280
That's like 10 mermaids, right?

2538
02:45:18,620 --> 02:45:26,480
yeah guys i think i have to sell him because i do have
another stream in about an hour i think it's time to sell

2539
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:27,100
our boy

2540
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:32,840
i think i have to sell him

2541
02:45:37,220 --> 02:45:46,540
i'm sorry i should have never bought the good oh

2542
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:58,340
Oh, I'll meet again.

2543
02:45:59,260 --> 02:46:00,700
No, nowhere.

2544
02:46:01,860 --> 02:46:03,220
No, nowhere.

2545
02:46:18,480 --> 02:46:18,860
Bye.

2546
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:19,540
Oh.

2547
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:23,480
It's just a bot.

2548
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:24,600
I can't.

2549
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:27,460
I don't want to part with him.

2550
02:46:34,410 --> 02:46:36,310
I don't want to part with him.

2551
02:46:37,470 --> 02:46:39,470
He looks so good on the back of my boat.

2552
02:46:52,510 --> 02:46:54,890
Oh, wait, I forgot the reason I came here.

2553
02:46:57,890 --> 02:47:00,590
I can't even afford the second speed.

2554
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:01,810
Sheesh.

2555
02:47:02,770 --> 02:47:03,030
Alright.

2556
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:06,730
Oh, wow, you won't let me...

2557
02:47:06,730 --> 02:47:08,030
Fine, I'll play your games.

2558
02:47:08,250 --> 02:47:09,190
Wait, I am in the front.

2559
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:19,300
Why won't you let me teleport to the back?

2560
02:47:21,660 --> 02:47:22,900
There's a will, there's a way.

2561
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:28,980
Gone but not forgotten.

2562
02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:30,280
My boat looks so empty.

2563
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:30,760
now!

2564
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:36,130
Oh, I'm at the back, that's right.

2565
02:47:36,750 --> 02:47:37,430
Alright, here we go!

2566
02:47:38,690 --> 02:47:40,730
Oh wait, let me also refuel.

2567
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:54,460
We will always remember.

2568
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:56,980
Remember how he was on my bow and it was so cute.

2569
02:47:57,100 --> 02:48:05,290
Okay, so no purple, but yes... I don't even know where I'm
going to though.

2570
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:23,090
I don't know if I'm doing this right or not.

2571
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:28,220
Am I doing this right?

2572
02:48:30,380 --> 02:48:30,620
Oh!

2573
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:33,740
My bell disappeared!

2574
02:48:39,650 --> 02:48:41,490
Oh, I can't see anything!

2575
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:42,750
Oh!

2576
02:48:43,450 --> 02:48:44,410
Did we die?

2577
02:48:46,630 --> 02:48:47,230
What?!

2578
02:48:48,230 --> 02:48:49,430
No way!

2579
02:48:51,190 --> 02:48:54,030
Oh, I didn't know it had a limited time use.

2580
02:48:54,310 --> 02:48:55,070
Okay, well...

2581
02:48:56,010 --> 02:48:56,770
Now we know.

2582
02:48:58,450 --> 02:48:59,450
Oh my god.

2583
02:48:59,850 --> 02:49:00,230
Okay.

2584
02:49:18,850 --> 02:49:19,990
I wish I could boost it.

2585
02:49:22,130 --> 02:49:23,990
I really wish I could boost.

2586
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:41,340
Okay, that's all I got.

2587
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:42,640
I think of it though.

2588
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:47,780
Wait, I think it's here.

2589
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:52,680
Ah, please!

2590
02:49:53,060 --> 02:49:53,520
No, please!

2591
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:57,980
Did I make it?

2592
02:49:58,540 --> 02:49:59,520
I think I made it?

2593
02:50:00,460 --> 02:50:02,620
Oh my god, we just barely made it.

2594
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:04,400
Whoa, that was so lucky.

2595
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:06,260
Oh, nice.

2596
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:07,200
Wow!

2597
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:09,420
We made it!

2598
02:50:11,560 --> 02:50:12,060
Dad!

2599
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:14,620
Thank goodness I finally found you.

2600
02:50:15,640 --> 02:50:17,420
They brought me all the way here.

2601
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:22,900
You made it all the way here, and Myuna came with you too?

2602
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:26,800
I am the one who sees through all things.

2603
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:30,260
It was I who cast the curse upon this world.

2604
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:33,100
I pride myself on being something close to a guard.

2605
02:50:34,100 --> 02:50:36,660
I think this is the... No, this is not the fish from the...

2606
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:38,060
Cover art.

2607
02:50:38,820 --> 02:50:39,300
Great whale voice.

2608
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:39,920
Thank you.

2609
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:43,180
And yet even I was swallowed by anger.

2610
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:46,480
The endless lament echoing from the sea's depths.

2611
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:49,620
The cries of lives trampled by humans.

2612
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:54,820
I listened to it all and learned what humans foolish, what
human foolishness truly was.

2613
02:50:55,580 --> 02:50:57,880
I believed I could not leave humans as they were.

2614
02:50:58,480 --> 02:51:01,220
But if humans and fish traded places, peace would come.

2615
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:05,860
It seems building a world is difficult for fish with so
little reason.

2616
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:16,260
Hi, I'm Fish, and yesterday I had memory for five seconds,
and today I have memory for five years.

2617
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:20,840
I don't even know how to twiddle my thumbs.

2618
02:51:25,960 --> 02:51:28,200
Even so, you alone became a true human.

2619
02:51:29,240 --> 02:51:30,080
Dad, listen.

2620
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:31,940
What I saw out there was awful.

2621
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:39,120
Those fish that look like people, they only have the worst
parts of humans, And they kept that thing fish have,

2622
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:40,760
cannibalism.

2623
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:49,820
The worst things that, the worst thing that fish have is
cannibalism.

2624
02:51:57,160 --> 02:52:00,660
It turned into something truly messed up.

2625
02:52:01,420 --> 02:52:07,580
It tried to fix this world on your own and it nearly killed
you.

2626
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:08,900
I don't blame you.

2627
02:52:09,980 --> 02:52:13,260
I tried my best, I tried to tell everyone in my own way, but
no one listened.

2628
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,920
They simply do not have the capacity to do so.

2629
02:52:16,220 --> 02:52:17,660
She said the word!

2630
02:52:18,940 --> 02:52:20,460
It always comes back to get him.

2631
02:52:22,300 --> 02:52:24,040
How do you keep doing this, Vito?

2632
02:52:25,220 --> 02:52:26,120
I don't know.

2633
02:52:30,150 --> 02:52:31,770
Humans really are selfish, huh?

2634
02:52:31,970 --> 02:52:32,370
And you.

2635
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:34,150
Humans hurt you too.

2636
02:52:34,710 --> 02:52:36,590
So I get why you thought you had no choice.

2637
02:52:37,570 --> 02:52:38,230
It's horrible.

2638
02:52:38,330 --> 02:52:39,970
The old world was still better than this.

2639
02:52:40,830 --> 02:52:42,870
That's why I think we should put everything back.

2640
02:52:43,410 --> 02:52:45,390
That doesn't have much time.

2641
02:52:46,270 --> 02:52:48,110
We'll handle what happens to this world from here.

2642
02:52:48,590 --> 02:52:50,170
You don't have to push yourself anymore.

2643
02:52:51,730 --> 02:52:54,690
I think we should break the curse, make fish and humans go
back to how they were.

2644
02:52:55,230 --> 02:52:56,830
But in the end, it's my decision.

2645
02:52:58,850 --> 02:52:59,870
Truly a mythos dream.

2646
02:53:01,750 --> 02:53:05,090
At least it's not humans eating humans, it's just fish
cannibalism, okay?

2647
02:53:06,270 --> 02:53:09,150
Because I believe you're the one who should take the helm of
this world.

2648
02:53:09,290 --> 02:53:09,510
Me?

2649
02:53:10,510 --> 02:53:12,470
No matter what happens, I'll accept it.

2650
02:53:13,410 --> 02:53:16,390
And, oh, and there it is, the omnipotent whale.

2651
02:53:16,930 --> 02:53:17,370
Oh, hello.

2652
02:53:18,230 --> 02:53:19,570
So you made it to the end.

2653
02:53:19,770 --> 02:53:21,050
Oh, why does he look so freaky, though?

2654
02:53:21,790 --> 02:53:23,710
I had the hunch you'd be the one to bring me here.

2655
02:53:24,330 --> 02:53:27,330
Right, I wasn't, I was looking for that whale too, wasn't I?

2656
02:53:28,830 --> 02:53:31,350
And hey, thanks for catching so many humans for me.

2657
02:53:32,050 --> 02:53:35,470
I don't even remember why anymore, but I used to hate
humans.

2658
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:39,250
But now, I don't know, it feels, it started to feel like it
doesn't matter.

2659
02:53:39,690 --> 02:53:40,550
Hate doesn't do anything.

2660
02:53:40,810 --> 02:53:42,030
The world doesn't get better.

2661
02:53:43,170 --> 02:53:43,390
True.

2662
02:53:45,810 --> 02:53:47,570
I still want to make this world better though.

2663
02:53:48,390 --> 02:53:50,230
But I have a fish at the end of the day, aren't I?

2664
02:53:50,530 --> 02:53:52,650
I try to think and nothing comes.

2665
02:53:55,010 --> 02:53:56,750
So I started an organization.

2666
02:53:57,250 --> 02:53:59,150
I think that involves a lot of thinking, no?

2667
02:54:01,230 --> 02:54:03,470
There's still so much I want to learn, so much I want to do.

2668
02:54:03,690 --> 02:54:05,570
I don't want to turn back into a fish like this.

2669
02:54:07,370 --> 02:54:09,390
As you can see, the time is coming to an end.

2670
02:54:10,530 --> 02:54:12,830
I know you've seen this world with your own eyes.

2671
02:54:13,170 --> 02:54:16,610
And from what I've felt, you seem to have the ability to
think.

2672
02:54:18,550 --> 02:54:21,550
Humans are something even I, a whale, can't fully
understand.

2673
02:54:22,830 --> 02:54:24,150
So now I want your answer.

2674
02:54:24,950 --> 02:54:27,070
And I want to entrust this world to you.

2675
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:31,410
Were the humans you met evil itself?

2676
02:54:33,730 --> 02:54:34,370
Wait, what?

2677
02:54:36,130 --> 02:54:37,530
If I say...

2678
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:39,810
Wait, the humans, like the fish humans that I met?

2679
02:54:40,310 --> 02:54:41,610
If I say no...

2680
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:47,700
I think they were just fish.

2681
02:54:51,480 --> 02:54:53,320
I think they were fish.

2682
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:58,380
That's one thing that, like, is pretty bad that humans do.

2683
02:54:58,480 --> 02:54:59,840
Is they humanize animals.

2684
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:01,060
Like, they give too many...

2685
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:03,900
They give animals, like, human characteristics, you know?

2686
02:55:08,480 --> 02:55:08,900
Um...

2687
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:09,200
Hmm.

2688
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:15,600
So, if I say yes, will it...

2689
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:17,920
So, if I say yes, does it go to her side?

2690
02:55:17,980 --> 02:55:19,240
If I say no, it sticks with...

2691
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:19,800
The guy.

2692
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:22,080
She's so cute, though.

2693
02:55:30,820 --> 02:55:31,700
Anthropomorphous maxing.

2694
02:55:31,880 --> 02:55:32,260
So true.

2695
02:55:32,480 --> 02:55:35,140
You murdered that poor fish that was just enjoying his boat.

2696
02:55:35,800 --> 02:55:36,820
You were the evil, Minto.

2697
02:55:38,100 --> 02:55:39,700
I'm a former human, so maybe.

2698
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:44,440
She's a human and not evil.

2699
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:45,480
So no.

2700
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:46,180
Oh, that's true.

2701
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:48,020
So, yeah, I was going to say no anyway, though.

2702
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:48,420
No.

2703
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:50,700
Is there a correct way to be human?

2704
02:55:52,300 --> 02:55:53,040
No.

2705
02:55:55,060 --> 02:55:57,620
Everybody comes in their own shape and size.

2706
02:55:58,840 --> 02:55:59,060
No.

2707
02:56:00,340 --> 02:56:02,260
Must humans be perfect?

2708
02:56:03,380 --> 02:56:03,600
No.

2709
02:56:05,220 --> 02:56:07,100
Is something fails once?

2710
02:56:07,340 --> 02:56:10,000
Is it never allowed to try again?

2711
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:11,840
No.

2712
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:16,240
Is it already too late to atone for my mistake?

2713
02:56:16,580 --> 02:56:16,800
Oh.

2714
02:56:17,260 --> 02:56:17,580
No.

2715
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:20,100
Should the curse be reversed?

2716
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:22,980
Yes?

2717
02:56:25,180 --> 02:56:25,580
Yes?

2718
02:56:26,500 --> 02:56:27,560
Are you sure?

2719
02:56:28,860 --> 02:56:30,980
Is it because you heard me say yes, question mark?

2720
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:35,040
Uh, yes.

2721
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:38,620
If that is what you say, then so be it.

2722
02:56:38,880 --> 02:56:39,420
I'm sorry.

2723
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:41,140
Go back to being a fish.

2724
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:42,440
You cost me a lot of money.

2725
02:56:45,700 --> 02:56:48,040
I also want to be a fish and not have to think about money.

2726
02:56:48,340 --> 02:56:49,620
Oh, get ending A!

2727
02:56:55,110 --> 02:56:56,050
Am I a fish?

2728
02:57:02,670 --> 02:57:03,070
Oh,

2729
02:57:09,230 --> 02:57:10,410
no, the people...

2730
02:57:10,410 --> 02:57:11,250
Wait, are they drowned?

2731
02:57:11,910 --> 02:57:12,410
Oh, gosh.

2732
02:57:12,550 --> 02:57:13,450
Why do they look like that?

2733
02:57:14,070 --> 02:57:15,610
Wait, they're not drowned, are they?

2734
02:57:15,650 --> 02:57:16,190
Just swim!

2735
02:57:16,350 --> 02:57:17,510
You turned back human, swim!

2736
02:57:20,690 --> 02:57:21,350
Uh-oh.

2737
02:57:22,490 --> 02:57:23,810
Did I kill everybody?

2738
02:57:25,130 --> 02:57:25,930
Uh-oh.

2739
02:57:30,270 --> 02:57:32,130
Wait, how was this the bad ending?

2740
02:57:32,910 --> 02:57:35,110
I'm sorry, but reversing the curse is...

2741
02:57:35,130 --> 02:57:36,270
That's the bad ending.

2742
02:57:39,130 --> 02:57:39,950
That's me.

2743
02:57:40,290 --> 02:57:42,810
The one that's just lying there really peacefully.

2744
02:57:45,110 --> 02:57:46,130
Just straight lying.

2745
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:55,560
I kind of want to try for the second ending.

2746
02:58:00,030 --> 02:58:04,850
Seems like the whale forgot some important details with
reversing the curve.

2747
02:58:05,810 --> 02:58:08,370
Look on the right side, the ocean is full of food now.

2748
02:58:09,210 --> 02:58:12,290
Oh, did I make the right choice?

2749
02:58:14,390 --> 02:58:16,110
That's a free question game.

2750
02:58:20,010 --> 02:58:21,850
Oh, we get to do it again!

2751
02:58:22,430 --> 02:58:23,010
Oh, awesome.

2752
02:58:23,610 --> 02:58:23,890
Wait.

2753
02:58:24,450 --> 02:58:25,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nice.

2754
02:58:26,290 --> 02:58:27,730
The game is judging me for real.

2755
02:58:30,030 --> 02:58:31,310
Alright, let's skip all of there.

2756
02:58:31,470 --> 02:58:32,870
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

2757
02:58:34,670 --> 02:58:36,130
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

2758
02:58:36,130 --> 02:58:37,690
They give me a second chance!

2759
02:58:41,530 --> 02:58:44,570
I think, though...

2760
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:47,210
Okay, I think these are all still right though.

2761
02:58:47,830 --> 02:58:54,930
No, no, no, no, no, should the curse be reversed?

2762
02:58:55,690 --> 02:58:55,890
No!

2763
02:58:56,590 --> 02:58:58,630
Then tell me, what is a human?

2764
02:58:59,270 --> 02:59:01,030
How can this world be made better?

2765
02:59:01,990 --> 02:59:02,950
To coexist.

2766
02:59:03,490 --> 02:59:06,030
Give once fish humans the power to think.

2767
02:59:08,870 --> 02:59:18,910
I feared the day you would speak that answer aloud ironic
isn't it for them to live together i must make them more

2768
02:59:18,910 --> 02:59:30,810
human this is like deep no i refuse to accept that for so
long that if but if that if that is your answer very well

2769
02:59:30,810 --> 02:59:35,330
the brain blast your wish shall be granted

2770
02:59:43,670 --> 02:59:48,910
I feel like endings for some of these games are kind of like
but this is

2771
02:59:53,230 --> 02:59:56,450
oh with their little safe accord still it's so cute

2772
03:00:09,280 --> 03:00:22,430
oh oh I like the ones that are like spawning out of nowhere
it's kind of freaking does that mean more humans are being

2773
03:00:22,430 --> 03:00:26,910
born or like what's going on look there's so more They're
all, they're just fish now.

2774
03:00:27,530 --> 03:00:29,170
Like, they don't look like freaky human fish.

2775
03:00:29,330 --> 03:00:30,310
They're just fish fish.

2776
03:00:31,450 --> 03:00:32,670
Except that guy.

2777
03:00:33,050 --> 03:00:33,790
Holy cow.

2778
03:00:40,710 --> 03:00:41,990
Oh, oh, umibazu!

2779
03:00:46,080 --> 03:00:47,660
Why is this so cute?

2780
03:01:05,220 --> 03:01:07,120
Oh, wait, he didn't die!

2781
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:11,980
There's schools!

2782
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:16,320
Dongi.

2783
03:01:16,340 --> 03:01:18,600
Don't eat fish and don't eat people.

2784
03:01:20,720 --> 03:01:22,000
Who the hell is that?

2785
03:01:28,420 --> 03:01:30,610
I don't remember that guy in my class.

2786
03:01:35,720 --> 03:01:36,220
Wow!

2787
03:01:36,640 --> 03:01:37,960
There's like so many people.

2788
03:01:38,620 --> 03:01:39,420
There's children.

2789
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:41,500
Wait, did we teach that to them too?

2790
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:43,840
Look at that girl's spin!

2791
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:45,440
Wait!

2792
03:01:47,500 --> 03:01:48,300
Artuna!

2793
03:01:49,220 --> 03:01:49,620
Artuna!

2794
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:53,060
Oh, this is so cute!

2795
03:01:55,140 --> 03:01:56,660
He's like a dog!

2796
03:01:57,300 --> 03:01:59,840
He's like that dancing dog meme!

2797
03:02:03,220 --> 03:02:04,780
You know what I'm talking about?

2798
03:02:05,660 --> 03:02:06,900
Oh, my baby!

2799
03:02:07,140 --> 03:02:08,300
My baby Tuna!

2800
03:02:14,980 --> 03:02:15,780
The

2801
03:02:23,100 --> 03:02:24,860
water is still messed up there.

2802
03:02:28,100 --> 03:02:30,920
The water is still messed up in that one spot.

2803
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:34,980
Oh, there was a sponsor.

2804
03:02:38,460 --> 03:02:39,220
Oh, this guy.

2805
03:02:46,870 --> 03:02:48,950
I like this one so much.

2806
03:02:50,810 --> 03:02:52,210
This is so fun.

2807
03:02:53,330 --> 03:02:55,610
Fish or lovers, not food, noted.

2808
03:02:56,530 --> 03:02:58,590
You will, the fish.

2809
03:02:58,950 --> 03:03:00,790
That guy, he was on his boat again.

2810
03:03:05,790 --> 03:03:08,730
Him, like, popping in and out is so funny.

2811
03:03:09,770 --> 03:03:10,330
Oh, whoa!

2812
03:03:10,870 --> 03:03:11,470
He's zooming.

2813
03:03:17,690 --> 03:03:19,330
The music's so cute, too.

2814
03:03:20,610 --> 03:03:26,690
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh.

2815
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:33,180
Oh, yeah, there's Zozo.

2816
03:03:34,360 --> 03:03:34,820
Village Vanguard.

2817
03:03:35,080 --> 03:03:35,820
Wow, their way.

2818
03:03:35,940 --> 03:03:37,160
They actually were in here.

2819
03:03:38,460 --> 03:03:39,480
That's crazy.

2820
03:03:40,620 --> 03:03:41,180
That's crazy.

2821
03:03:41,380 --> 03:03:44,160
I wonder who I was, you know?

2822
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:46,760
I

2823
03:03:50,430 --> 03:03:55,490
guess this means your wisdom from earlier can no longer
apply unless you're, like, catching criminal fish only.

2824
03:03:59,430 --> 03:04:01,730
No, they're their own types of humans.

2825
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:07,500
Chilla got sponsors now.

2826
03:04:07,600 --> 03:04:10,660
Maybe that's why the game, like, is longer.

2827
03:04:13,060 --> 03:04:14,740
The appearance of a higher budget.

2828
03:04:23,380 --> 03:04:24,640
Good work, Mito!

2829
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:25,500
Thank you!

2830
03:04:28,620 --> 03:04:29,420
Who's that?

2831
03:04:29,800 --> 03:04:30,800
Crying up tall.

2832
03:04:36,460 --> 03:04:37,620
Who is that?

2833
03:04:40,140 --> 03:04:42,300
I actually like this one so much, though.

2834
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:45,340
That was really fun.

2835
03:04:45,980 --> 03:04:46,620
Thank you, guys.

2836
03:04:46,700 --> 03:04:49,620
I would stick around for longer, but I have another stream
in an hour, so...

2837
03:04:51,860 --> 03:04:52,340
Yay!

2838
03:04:52,540 --> 03:04:53,920
We finished Umigari!

2839
03:04:54,660 --> 03:04:55,140
Yuppie!

2840
03:04:55,440 --> 03:04:56,060
Yuppie, yuppie!

2841
03:04:56,520 --> 03:04:57,820
Hot dog.

2842
03:04:57,860 --> 03:04:59,000
Hot dog!

2843
03:04:59,120 --> 03:05:00,400
Dried princess, thank you!

2844
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:02,060
Are fish humans?

2845
03:05:02,200 --> 03:05:03,020
Are humans fish?

2846
03:05:03,140 --> 03:05:04,920
Why does Minto play games with cannibalism?

2847
03:05:05,020 --> 03:05:06,380
