1
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,360
Streaming...

2
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,540
Oh!

3
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:06,980
Oh!

4
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,560
Oh!

5
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,420
Oh!

6
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,320
Oh!

7
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,820
Oh, I think it's... Okay.

8
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,040
Oh, I think it's... Okay.

9
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,620
I, uh...

10
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,020
I, um... Wait, hold on.

11
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,700
Oh, gosh.

12
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,920
Oh, I'm all over the place.

13
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,580
I, uh, moved some stuff around.

14
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,620
I moved some stuff around today, so...

15
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,720
My setup is all wonky right now for me.

16
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,360
Hello!

17
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,400
Wait,

18
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,540
hold on.

19
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,540
Oh, my gosh.

20
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,260
Sorry, I'm all turned around today.

21
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,420
Okay.

22
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,720
Oh, if I move...

23
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
And then...

24
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,040
It, uh...

25
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
Stops the music.

26
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,700
Sorry.

27
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,740
Oh, there we go.

28
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,640
Hi, guys!

29
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,020
It's me, Minto.

30
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,140
Actually.

31
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,700
Yeah.

32
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,490
Welcome.

33
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,490
Oh, why am I so... Why do I feel so weird?

34
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,530
I didn't think that, like, changing my setup would make me feel...

35
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,270
So naked.

36
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,610
Like, I feel like I'm...

37
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,610
I feel like when I'm, like, not streaming from home, I feel so strange.

38
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,370
Because everything is different for me.

39
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,850
Not for you guys, but for me.

40
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,610
So it's making me...

41
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,790
Making me feel weird.

42
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,110
Anyway.

43
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,530
I didn't... I didn't...

44
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,070
I technically didn't clickbait, so...

45
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,610
There we go!

46
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,390
Welcome to...

47
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,590
The inn.

48
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,850
The inn?

49
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,610
The inn of...

50
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,270
Saneness.

51
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,550
No more lilac?

52
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,910
No, because you guys are weird!

53
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,490
Because you guys always say...

54
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,350
Oh, I don't like Minto anymore.

55
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,830
I only like lilac.

56
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,530
No!

57
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,090
Because you guys are weird about it!

58
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,370
That's why!

59
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,370
No more!

60
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,260
Anyway.

61
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,520
Yeah, so...

62
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,700
This is a...

63
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,700
Indie horror game that I...

64
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,720
Saw some other creators that I follow play, and...

65
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,240
I was like, oh, this seems pretty decent.

66
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,200
It's kind of, I think, a long... A bit of a longer game.

67
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,700
But I want to finish it in one go, so...

68
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,820
We'll do that.

69
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,060
And... Okay, guys.

70
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,580
Okay, that's... That's enough!

71
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,900
I shouldn't have even...

72
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,760
Brought it up then.

73
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,380
If you guys are not even gonna pay attention to what I'm saying!

74
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,880
Anyway.

75
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,240
Okay.

76
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,120
Cool.

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
What was I saying?

78
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,580
I want to play a game.

79
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,380
So we'll play a game.

80
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,280
Sorry, I feel very...

81
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,240
Out of it today.

82
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,580
I don't know why.

83
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,980
I feel very out of it.

84
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
I woke up feeling very tired.

85
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,840
I feel very tired now.

86
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,740
But I just want to play a game.

87
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,860
Thank you for the Akasho ball!

88
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,740
Do it for the wisp?

89
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,100
Bring out lilac.

90
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,260
No.

91
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,160
No.

92
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,500
No.

93
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed?

94
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:55,920
Maybe.

95
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,080
It's one of those things about being...

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,040
Like, it's one of those...

97
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,920
I guess it's like a first world problem about being a...

98
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,420
A content creator, right?

99
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,580
Because it's just like...

100
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,920
Oh, if I'm having an off day...

101
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,020
I have to like just kinda suck it up, you know?

102
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,920
It's like...

103
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,920
Otherwise, my feelings will make me...

104
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
You know...

105
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,520
Have less fun.

106
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
So it's just one of those things where it's just like...

107
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,860
I'm broadcasting myself everyday.

108
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,240
So it's like...

109
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,220
If I'm having an off day, it's like...

110
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,040
I gotta put on my big girl panties and say whatever.

111
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,280
So...

112
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,720
It's just like the service industry.

113
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,120
True!

114
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,400
Yeah, right?

115
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,500
My granny panties.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,220
Oh, yes, son.

117
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,920
My panties.

118
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,340
That's what grandmas say, probably.

119
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,580
No, I think I'm okay though.

120
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,180
I'm not gonna be like so grumpy.

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,920
I think it's... I don't know.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,960
Like I said, I cleaned.

123
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,440
But...

124
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
Since I rearranged my desk, I feel so weird.

125
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,220
Okay, I'm gonna have to move this.

126
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,540
Hold on.

127
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
Oh my god, it's driving me insane!

128
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:17,880
Okay.

129
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,300
Oh wait, I can't move it now.

130
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,920
Okay, I'm just not gonna touch this part.

131
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,460
I usually...

132
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,260
Touch while I'm on stream.

133
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,900
But I moved it to the other side of my desk.

134
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
And now it's bothering me.

135
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,840
Alright.

136
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,120
So yeah, this game is...

137
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,660
Like I said, it's a little longer.

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,260
I've watched a little bit of when people played.

139
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,120
It's like about...

140
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,620
I don't...

141
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,240
You go to this hotel...

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,720
You go to this hotel and then...

143
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,860
The end of the world happens.

144
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,420
And then you acquire a Hot Goth GF.

145
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,260
So yeah.

146
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,300
Kind of awesome, if you ask me.

147
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,620
Highly appreciated.

148
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,140
Thank you.

149
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,900
Hot Goth GF.

150
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,340
That's all I need to hear.

151
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,820
Yeah, so let's check it out.

152
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,380
But also like...

153
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,900
I think there's something wrong with us.

154
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,740
I mean, of course.

155
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,620
But...

156
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,640
We can't see people's faces.

157
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,500
For some reason.

158
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,740
Save me, ghost girl.

159
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,440
The Sanity...

160
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Wait, it's actually called Sanity Inn?

161
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,400
Why would you name it that?

162
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,610
Walk to the hotel manager.

163
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,550
This is an inn?

164
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,950
Aren't inns supposed to be like...

165
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,470
Quaint?

166
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,370
And...

167
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,270
Dainty?

168
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,470
Aren't they supposed to be like a little...

169
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,090
The inn.

170
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,250
Oh my gosh.

171
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,920
Hello?

172
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,660
Oh, I'm tiny.

173
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I'm so small.

174
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,420
Hello, are you the manager?

175
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,520
I want to rent a room.

176
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,720
Could you please wait?

177
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,780
I'll be free soon.

178
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,620
Okay.

179
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,380
Okay, how do I get out of the dialogue?

180
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,400
I'm waiting.

181
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,300
Okay.

182
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,820
Looking at my toes.

183
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
I want to press the bell, but I can't reach it?

184
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,670
Try clicking?

185
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,850
What do you think I'm doing?

186
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,470
I'm clicking?

187
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,750
This guy is hacking into something.

188
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,770
Listen to him go.

189
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,790
I just started the game.

190
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,030
Oh wow, what a lovely chandelier you have.

191
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,790
At the Inn Sanity.

192
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,090
I mean the Sanity Inn.

193
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,750
I pressed space, it worked.

194
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,770
You look like an angel.

195
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,770
Okay, it's space bar.

196
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,350
I love your compliments.

197
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,950
Give me another one.

198
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,550
That's how I speak too.

199
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,570
I wonder what tone she used when she said that.

200
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,530
Was it flirtation or sarcasm?

201
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,550
Wait, so he like actually...

202
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,190
He can't hear.

203
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,050
It's like an actual video.

204
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,130
Like a dialogue box pops up for him.

205
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,190
Like a video game.

206
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,270
The guy is in the game.

207
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,510
Oh my gosh, this is Sword Art Online maybe.

208
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,490
Your husband is a complete idiot.

209
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,510
To leave such a beauty.

210
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,310
Let's not talk about that.

211
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,990
Today we'll forget about him.

212
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,510
And your wife.

213
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,910
I'm gonna keep listening.

214
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,070
This is tea.

215
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,250
Of course.

216
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,190
Are you okay?

217
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,850
The whole town is having nightmares.

218
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,690
Are they bothering you too?

219
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,110
Not anymore.

220
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,270
Good.

221
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,470
I'm glad they've stopped.

222
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,130
Because now we can...

223
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,710
Can what?

224
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,290
My nightmares continue.

225
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,590
Oh, it's just that they don't bother me anymore.

226
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,630
As long as there's wine and you nearby.

227
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:51,770
Damn.

228
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,510
This will be a wonderful evening, my angel.

229
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,370
This is like...

230
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,890
This feels like actual like...

231
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,510
Aliens pretending to be human speech.

232
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,750
Right now.

233
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,930
This place has to invest heavily into the decor to make up for the fact it was named the Sanity Inn.

234
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,250
Maybe the last...

235
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,390
The person who made it, their last name was Sanity, right?

236
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,010
That would make sense.

237
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,490
Why does it always come back to NTR?

238
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:20,910
I don't know.

239
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,130
Oh, wait a second.

240
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,090
Your nose is bleeding.

241
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,690
Young man, please come over.

242
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,790
Oh, I'm the young man.

243
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,550
Welcome to Sanity Inn.

244
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,730
What can I do for you?

245
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,990
I need a room for one night.

246
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,430
I like the dialogue.

247
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,470
The way the options show up.

248
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,050
Certainly.

249
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,050
Can I have your name, please?

250
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,370
It doesn't matter.

251
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,950
That's not how these places work.

252
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,410
John Smith.

253
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,930
What if I say...

254
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,050
What if I say I'm going to give you...

255
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,970
Clearly, I want to be anonymous.

256
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,570
I'll leave a tip and you write nothing.

257
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,390
You are very generous, Mr. Thompson.

258
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,910
The manager is corrupt.

259
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,300
Oh my god.

260
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,220
The registration will take just a minute.

261
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,280
Meanwhile, I would like to tell you about our hotel.

262
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,520
Sanity takes pride in its restaurant, which is located on the roof of our esteemed building.

263
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,400
We also recently opened a swimming pool.

264
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,360
This place of this caliber and size only just recently opened up a swimming pool?

265
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,540
You are looking at me strangely.

266
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,240
Is everything okay?

267
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,460
Okay, rude.

268
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,620
Crap, he picked up on it.

269
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,700
It's none of your business.

270
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,440
Everything is fine.

271
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,980
Please continue.

272
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
Are you sure?

273
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,740
Go a little further.

274
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,180
There you will find the elevator.

275
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,880
Go up to the third floor.

276
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,540
The room number is 302.

277
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,640
You can contact the front desk, restaurant, or security by phone.

278
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,760
And sir, here is your key card.

279
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,400
Welcome to Sanity Inn.

280
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,180
He's the real hentai protagonist.

281
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,960
This is how they should do it instead of having their hair really long, right?

282
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,760
Hotel key card!

283
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,520
Oh, they're gone.

284
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,380
No!

285
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,400
My...

286
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,300
My couple!

287
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,720
Was she there before?

288
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,220
Oh my god, what is she doing just standing there?

289
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,800
She scared me.

290
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,200
I don't think this game is from...

291
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,620
I don't think it's necessarily super scary, but it has like a good atmosphere.

292
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,600
From...

293
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,100
What I got from it.

294
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,160
So...

295
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,840
Yeah.

296
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,600
I should say hi.

297
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,720
I can't go over there.

298
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,080
Sometimes the mystique is the allure, right?

299
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,360
She's shrouded in shadow.

300
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,900
She's got that hourglass figure.

301
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,640
You know what?

302
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,960
I don't even need to meet her.

303
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,500
I know she's my soulmate from afar.

304
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,340
Horse.

305
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,760
And...

306
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,150
Deer.

307
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,520
And...

308
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,180
A lighthouse?

309
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
Let's go to our room.

310
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,960
302.

311
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,120
Call the elevator.

312
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,240
Ping pong!

313
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,400
Oh, is this the swimming pool?

314
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,160
Maybe we go later.

315
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,620
Third floor, please.

316
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,440
Hold the door!

317
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,370
This can't be real.

318
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,590
Why am I hearing her?

319
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,150
Is something wrong?

320
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,270
Is there something stuck in my teeth?

321
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,970
Oh, young miss.

322
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,870
Do I be weird about it?

323
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,470
Sorry.

324
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,090
Do I be weird about it?

325
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,530
Marriage.

326
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,830
Oh my god, the romantic music playing.

327
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,010
I don't think this is a horror game, you guys.

328
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,670
Be weird about it.

329
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,950
I heard your voice.

330
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,010
This place was huge.

331
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,710
How is it only five floors?

332
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,530
I don't understand.

333
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,450
Fourth floor.

334
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,970
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,570
How's the audio, by the way?

336
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,670
I feel like she's a little quiet.

337
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,550
Why am I hearing her voice?

338
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,270
Something has changed.

339
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,470
She's the one.

340
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,230
Oh my god, forget that silhouetted woman.

341
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,550
Forget the silhouetted woman.

342
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,550
This is the woman of my dreams.

343
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,890
I don't know.

344
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,470
I couldn't go outside very often.

345
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,050
Okay, if I say that, she'll definitely know something's wrong with me.

346
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,030
I don't know.

347
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,210
I don't know.

348
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,890
Okay, I feel we're very passionate about movies.

349
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,770
We said the most here, right?

350
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,450
Your bedroom?

351
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,410
Stop!

352
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,970
We have to win her over first.

353
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,490
Oh my gosh.

354
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,490
The matching, like, oh my god, single leg...

355
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,730
And then the arm...

356
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,810
Oh my god.

357
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,230
It's just such a good fit.

358
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,690
We must woo her.

359
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:30,690
I don't know.

360
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,250
Maybe the movie theater.

361
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,750
She seems like... Goth girls like movies, right?

362
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,910
Swashbuckling?

363
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,710
So she's also a weirdo.

364
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,210
What do you mean?

365
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,850
I've never been to a movie theater before.

366
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,350
What's swash...

367
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,470
Swashbuckling.

368
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,370
You guys, she's perfect.

369
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,770
Oh.

370
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,290
Yeah.

371
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,070
I hope we meet again someday.

372
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,090
I knew it was love when I heard her voice.

373
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,690
I mean, sure, it's the only one I can hear.

374
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,370
Thanks for the advice.

375
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:23,810
Oh my gosh, when she's illuminated by the fluorescent lighting of the elevator, she looks like a true angel.

376
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,670
No!

377
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,730
My queen!

378
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,710
Check into room 302.

379
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,710
So what do they do with the rest of the building if there's only five floors?

380
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,650
Also rude.

381
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,890
Blocking the entire way here.

382
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,370
We got Elvis.

383
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,550
302.

384
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,210
Oh god!

385
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,770
Oh, you scared me.

386
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,170
Young man, are you checking in too?

387
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,110
Yes, sir.

388
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,930
Be careful.

389
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,510
It's a sinful place.

390
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,370
Trust no one.

391
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,290
Hey, young man.

392
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,770
Do you trust people?

393
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,010
I'd like to say mostly yes.

394
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,310
We're a glass half full type of person, I think.

395
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,190
Trust should be placed in God alone.

396
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,650
You'll understand this... I keep biting my tongue recently.

397
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,450
You'll understand this soon enough.

398
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,410
Okay, good thing my room is...

399
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,690
this way, I think.

400
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,670
He's blocking that.

401
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,610
311.

402
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,770
Okay, this place is not as fancy as I once believed.

403
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,950
I thought that was like a man sniffing her.

404
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,570
That's just her bird.

405
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,910
Hear the music?

406
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Oh my god, she's giggling.

407
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,560
I trust people, I do not trust dudes with mosaic face.

408
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,980
Oh, we're all the way at the end of the hallway, I think.

409
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,860
Let's just run down there.

410
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,300
Alright, 302.

411
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,460
That's me.

412
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,460
Unlock the door.

413
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,280
There we go.

414
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,260
Home, sweet home.

415
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,380
Finally.

416
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,280
Oh, that's...

417
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,360
I got achievement for checking into my room.

418
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,360
All that's left is to unpack my things and get ready.

419
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm... Oh, there we go.

420
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm trapped.

421
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,660
There we go.

422
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,100
Unpack my things.

423
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,340
We got a soundtrack too?

424
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,000
Put my razor?

425
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,340
I bought it on the way here.

426
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,700
It's sharp enough.

427
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
It will do?

428
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,920
Like...

429
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,600
What razors are supposed to do.

430
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,740
Guys, are we the baddie?

431
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,720
Are we gonna go on a murdering spree?

432
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,020
Wow, they only give us shampoo, no conditioner?

433
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,740
It'll do.

434
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,960
Oh wow, we got like a whole suite.

435
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,960
Put my backpack.

436
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,420
Who would have thought that all my things would fit in one old bag.

437
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,240
Oh, we're definitely gonna murder people, I think.

438
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,300
Wow, what a view.

439
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,380
Wow, it's kinda nice though.

440
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,560
Oh my gosh.

441
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,120
Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm in a film noir.

442
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,180
It's a full moon night.

443
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,360
The clouds are moving at a pace.

444
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,520
And me, I'm thinking of that gal back home in town.

445
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,180
The gal I left behind.

446
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,240
Because she died.

447
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,520
Every detective needs a tragic backstory.

448
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,320
But I'm here to start anew.

449
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,540
Oh, nevermind.

450
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,360
This one doesn't fit the vibe.

451
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,420
Oh, we can change the station.

452
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,220
Oh yeah, this is good.

453
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,240
This is good.

454
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,700
Back to my monologuing.

455
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,660
And here in this old town is a case.

456
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,900
A case that only I can solve.

457
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,740
And why can I only be the one to solve it?

458
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,240
Because I'm secretly the murderer.

459
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,940
But you don't know that yet, neither do I.

460
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,920
It's a whole Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde situation.

461
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,360
And me, I'm Mr. Hyde.

462
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,040
But you won't find me hiding.

463
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,560
What else do I have?

464
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,840
I put away all my stuff, apparently.

465
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,800
And you want a bottle of water?

466
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,520
Well, they assume that I got this room with two people.

467
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,900
Do I have a coat?

468
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,120
What else do I need to put away?

469
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,120
Toilet paper?

470
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,680
Sounds like a cold case, bro.

471
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,140
No!

472
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,140
The case is hot.

473
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,700
Sizzling, even.

474
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,940
Just like the bacon she used to make me in the morning.

475
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,600
The day before she died, she made me that bacon.

476
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,960
And then I ate it.

477
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,080
And it was crispy.

478
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,440
But then she slipped and she fell and the pot of bacon bonked her on the head and she died.

479
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,580
And the reason I couldn't hear her was because I was too involved in the job.

480
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm murdered to my... wait, not murdered.

481
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,780
I'm married.

482
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm married to my work.

483
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,720
Oh, this is my... oh, put the photo.

484
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,340
Oh my god, it's her!

485
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,660
This is her.

486
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,540
This is her right before sizzling up some good bacon.

487
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,560
I've already started to forget what she looked like.

488
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,020
It's good that I still have a photo.

489
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,700
What is that beeping?

490
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,260
No, my music.

491
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,800
What's happening?

492
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Oh, listen to the radio.

493
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,100
Oh, attention.

494
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:38,200
We interrupt our program to bring you an urgent message from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

495
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:38,920
Uh oh.

496
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Uh oh.

497
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,640
A temporary quarantine is being declared in the city due to a natural gas leak.

498
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,880
Would that require a quarantine or...

499
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,320
You may observe power outages in some areas.

500
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,040
Specialists are already working on solving the problem.

501
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,160
A gas leak... a Resident Evil-esque announcement.

502
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Do not leave your homes and do not go outside.

503
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,460
Stay calm and follow official announcements.

504
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
Also, don't light any cigarettes.

505
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,960
The situation is under control.

506
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,240
A citywide gas leak.

507
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,740
Something doesn't add up.

508
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,820
Cutscene.

509
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,940
Earthquake?

510
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,540
Oh, what the hell?

511
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh god!

512
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
The moon fell!

513
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,140
What?

514
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,670
I don't think that's...

515
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,830
This is a pretty big gas leak, you guys.

516
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,530
Oh, jeez.

517
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,470
Oh no!

518
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,810
The car is going off.

519
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,790
It's a nice touch.

520
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,950
The clouds are going at like a million miles per hour.

521
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,910
Everything is under control, everybody.

522
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,980
A scream.

523
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,240
I need to check what happened.

524
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,520
I don't think we do.

525
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,400
I don't think we need to check.

526
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,680
Oh my god.

527
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,300
Oh my god.

528
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,860
Hello?

529
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,180
Do I go towards the purple light?

530
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,240
It wasn't Goth GF, was it?

531
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,680
Oh my god.

532
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,660
Music.

533
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,340
Hello?

534
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,720
Where are all the lights off?

535
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,140
Oh god, I'm not going down there.

536
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,600
Hello?

537
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,440
Hello?

538
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,420
What's going on here?

539
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,640
I need to get out.

540
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,600
Yeah, we do.

541
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,300
Let's leave.

542
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,440
Hello?

543
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,220
If you want to live, go back to your room and lock the door.

544
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,200
Do you understand me?

545
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,940
There is a dead body in here.

546
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,980
I don't have time for it, kid.

547
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,060
Just do what I say.

548
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
Go back to your room, lock the door and don't open it.

549
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,500
No matter what anyone says.

550
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,040
Oh shoot.

551
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:41,900
Damn.

552
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,700
Oh my god, they got him good.

553
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,380
Oh, what's this?

554
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,020
Bloodstained note.

555
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,040
It seems that the man I saw in the lobby was here.

556
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,020
Oh no!

557
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,260
What happened to him and where is that woman?

558
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,900
Oh my gosh, it's the couple from the lobby.

559
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,760
My angel, I'm waiting for you at the hotel today.

560
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,680
My wife has gone to her parents, so we have the whole weekend.

561
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,520
That's so silly.

562
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,740
Wee woo.

563
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,160
Wee woo.

564
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,000
Okay, let's go back to our room.

565
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,480
Just run for it.

566
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,700
Go inside my room.

567
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,820
Oh god.

568
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,640
Oh god, I'm being observed.

569
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,340
From the darkness.

570
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,880
I don't see anyone there.

571
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,060
I need to call the rescue service.

572
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,720
What's their number in this town?

573
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,180
Oh my gosh, even the lights in here.

574
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,780
Everything is freaking me out.

575
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,800
It's scary.

576
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,540
Pick up the phone.

577
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,260
66911.

578
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,210
I think they know.

579
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,950
I feel like they probably know.

580
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:00,910
Right?

581
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,650
Oh, call.

582
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,670
I feel like they probably know.

583
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,010
Hello.

584
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,450
You've called the rescue service.

585
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,630
Unfortunately, all our operators are currently busy.

586
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,970
Your place in queue is 54.

587
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,090
Please stay on the line or call back later.

588
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,950
What on earth is happening?

589
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,550
Wait, who called me earlier?

590
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,650
Maybe I should have asked.

591
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,610
It seems like the knocking isn't at my door.

592
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,250
Oh, there's knocking?

593
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,950
I didn't hear it.

594
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,270
I need to check out what's going on.

595
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,430
I don't think we do!

596
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,510
Why?

597
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,390
What do you mean we need to check out what's going on?

598
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,450
Just look at the people.

599
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,450
OK, thank goodness.

600
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,950
I hear it now.

601
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,030
Oh, I hear it now.

602
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,210
Oh, 303?

603
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,950
Oh, you are beautiful.

604
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,530
The guy!

605
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,070
Wait, wasn't he torn up?

606
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,410
I love compliments.

607
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,080
Oh!

608
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,100
I love compliments.

609
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,640
What is going on?

610
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,000
Day 1.

611
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,380
You have survived to the beginning of the first day.

612
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,020
And we're asleep in the bathroom.

613
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,540
With our razor blade.

614
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,320
You know what?

615
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:36,860
Fair.

616
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,120
You know what?

617
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,800
Totally valid actually.

618
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,240
Good morning world.

619
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,940
It was all just a bad dream.

620
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,940
Everything is fine.

621
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,460
Look at the birds are singing.

622
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,320
The sun is shining.

623
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,360
Oh no.

624
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,120
The cars are flipped over.

625
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,260
Yeah, seems like... At least we have water.

626
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,760
Oh, and 007.

627
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,260
Why did I...

628
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,680
Assess to the news.

629
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,800
The quarantine continues.

630
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,860
The city police have received over a hundred reports of attacks by mentally unstable individuals.

631
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,780
Some witnesses claim that the attackers appeared physically deformed.

632
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,640
The Center for Disease Control...

633
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,600
Sorry, have not commented on these reports.

634
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,660
Birthday?

635
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,280
I can't exit out of the game.

636
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,680
Getter Emperor, is it your birthday?

637
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,640
Happy birthday!

638
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,360
Happy birthday to you.

639
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,080
Happy birthday to you.

640
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,780
Happy birthday Getter Emperor.

641
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,640
Happy birthday to you.

642
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,980
Meanwhile, the state administration has declared a state of emergency.

643
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,020
We strongly recommend everyone in the quarantine area to stay at home and limit social interactions.

644
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Attention,

645
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,960
the infected can be very dangerous.

646
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,400
I thought it was just natural gas.

647
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:38,880
The expert committee continues to study the cases of infection, but so far has been unable to identify the source and method of disease transmission.

648
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,180
We will continue to keep you updated.

649
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,200
For now, we move on to our next segment.

650
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,320
It will be songs by your request.

651
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,100
You know, let's just move on from...

652
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,920
Anybody trying to listen to the radio?

653
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,260
For news about what's going on, sorry.

654
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,480
We don't need to continuously broadcast this.

655
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,460
We're just going to play music at this time.

656
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:05,940
Thank you.

657
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,100
I hope somebody plays...

658
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,820
Smash Mouth.

659
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,360
Somebody once told me...

660
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,240
You're staying alive?

661
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,920
What would you play?

662
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,100
What would be your soundtrack?

663
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,040
The end of the world soundtrack, I wonder.

664
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,280
I'm still standing.

665
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,840
Just yesterday it was natural gas.

666
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,440
Now they're talking about an infection.

667
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,660
Do they even have a clue what's going on?

668
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,000
So true.

669
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,140
So I think we need to call James Bond.

670
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,080
Oh, what's this?

671
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,160
Program foster home.

672
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,180
Foster care.

673
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,600
You are not alone.

674
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,400
Help for orphans, children and adolescents.

675
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,260
Oh, children.

676
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,540
Children and adolescents.

677
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,820
662525.

678
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,520
Okay.

679
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,540
I'll take that.

680
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,300
What about my dead wife?

681
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,820
I hear a lot of popping and stuff.

682
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,420
At least we can hide in the closet, maybe, probably.

683
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,200
Were these always here before?

684
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,340
These cables?

685
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,260
Okay, the music.

686
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,400
Who requested this?

687
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,060
Who the hell asked for creepy ambiance?

688
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,520
007 Oh.

689
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,220
Pick up the phone.

690
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,520
007.

691
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:33,980
Call.

692
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,860
I did.

693
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,260
Sorry.

694
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,280
This is a watcher.

695
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,920
Are you still alive, kid?

696
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,700
Great.

697
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,600
Watcher?

698
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,040
That's my job title.

699
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,920
I'm in charge of the hotel security.

700
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,480
Or at least I'm trying to be.

701
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,580
The hotel is dangerous.

702
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,360
The problem is that it's even more dangerous outside.

703
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,740
They're saying on the radio that it's a gas leak.

704
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Do you believe that?

705
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,560
No.

706
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,680
Maybe.

707
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,380
Maybe I'm dumb.

708
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
What if I say maybe?

709
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,660
Sounds like bullshit to me.

710
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,260
They're hiding something.

711
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,720
And the police aren't coming.

712
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,260
All this smells really bad, kid.

713
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,080
Yeah, because it's a gas leak.

714
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:31,820
Duh.

715
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,620
I don't know how long we'll be stuck here, but there's a chance it could be for a while.

716
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,300
And don't talk to anyone.

717
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,940
It could end badly.

718
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,520
Is that the sound of my door unlocking?

719
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,660
Wait, hold on.

720
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,220
I want to call.

721
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,700
What was it?

722
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,200
6-6-2525.

723
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:10,920
Call.

724
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
What about our hot goth GF?

725
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,300
I know!

726
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,500
Should I call him again?

727
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,080
I'm not sure.

728
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,760
Foster care support line.

729
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,800
How can we assist you?

730
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,600
Contact my curator.

731
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,460
Hello, I didn't think you'd call.

732
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,700
Happy 18th birthday!

733
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,900
Oh my god, it's our birthday!

734
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,860
I wanted to say goodbye.

735
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Can I return to the shelter?

736
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,400
Something strange is happening here.

737
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,360
Can I go home?

738
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,820
Can I return to the shelter?

739
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,460
Sorry, but you've been declared fully capable, so I can't help you.

740
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,950
Oh my gosh, I can't stop yawning.

741
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,010
Your condition is not as serious as you think.

742
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,850
If you...

743
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,570
Sorry, I'm getting another call on another line.

744
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,250
It seems something happened at your shelter.

745
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,250
I need to sort this out.

746
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:05,770
Good luck!

747
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,340
Who turned the radio back on?

748
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,880
I didn't turn it on.

749
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,060
Wait, who turned the radio on?

750
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,740
My condition is not so bad, they're saying.

751
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,280
I really sound like...

752
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:35,420
They're not beating the Film Noir sad detective allegations here.

753
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,600
OK guys, we gotta go find some food.

754
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,300
I don't wanna leave.

755
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,040
OK, we can't go into 301.

756
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,940
Oh gosh, do we even wanna go into 303?

757
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,940
Oh my god!

758
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,100
What's that?

759
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,800
That's all they left.

760
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,200
Oh, what's this?

761
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,680
Bubble love gum.

762
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,800
A chewing gum.

763
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,100
There is a trading card with some romantic phrase on it inside a package.

764
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,140
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I have no experience in this matter.

765
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,560
Might come in handy.

766
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,540
Oh, wait.

767
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,520
In what way?

768
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,100
Wait, do we have like an inventory?

769
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,980
Not that I know how to access.

770
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,440
I think there is a body here, but it's way dark.

771
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,720
Anything?

772
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,500
Any food?

773
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,500
OK, you just got bubble gum.

774
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,420
I got it.

775
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:42,900
Understandable.

776
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,500
Oh, what's in here?

777
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,520
Nothing, OK.

778
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,280
I don't wanna get jump scared, you guys.

779
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,700
You can eat the person.

780
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,900
Yeah, exactly.

781
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,160
Free food on the floor.

782
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,480
Brains for brunch.

783
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,080
OK, let's 304.

784
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,140
305?

785
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,840
No.

786
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,620
Wait, 304 was... Yeah, no good.

787
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,680
306?

788
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,820
No, OK.

789
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,100
307?

790
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,080
OK.

791
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,220
Well, we went into 308 before.

792
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,140
Oh, we can go in again.

793
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,860
Maybe there is something else.

794
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,320
Wow!

795
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,700
He's not wearing clothes either.

796
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,440
They were in mid-action.

797
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,980
Oh my god, it's kind of awful.

798
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,900
It's just spaghetti, you guys.

799
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,160
Wait, does this room not have a bathroom?

800
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:52,840
Oh, here we go.

801
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,780
Oh, it's trousers and everything.

802
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,440
I'm a vampire.

803
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,300
I steal their soap or something.

804
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,880
We don't know how long we are going to be here for.

805
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:07,960
OK.

806
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,700
Let's go to 309?

807
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,620
No.

808
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,340
Oh gosh, what are these?

809
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,580
Are we going to jump scare B310?

810
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,400
No.

811
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,360
What happened to 311?

812
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,060
312?

813
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,520
OK.

814
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,660
Oh, that's right.

815
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,760
It has a weird number.

816
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,760
Young man, over here.

817
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,040
Is it the priest?

818
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,100
It is kind of awful.

819
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,440
Why are you making fun of me?

820
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,380
Would a film noir mint be made sephia?

821
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,260
Maybe.

822
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,920
No, it would have to be...

823
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,940
It would have to be black and white, right?

824
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,120
Made grey.

825
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,660
Made grey.

826
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,860
Yes?

827
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,660
Young man, I need help.

828
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,860
Oh, ignore and move on.

829
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,820
What happened?

830
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,780
I'm not feeling very well.

831
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,880
My blood pressure has risen, but I couldn't get through to the ambulance.

832
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,600
Please help me find the medicine.

833
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,220
It seems he met the mothman.

834
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,680
Oh my gosh.

835
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,720
Got fricked boneless.

836
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,820
Made noir.

837
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,260
Oh my gosh, Kevin.

838
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,880
Why didn't I think of that?

839
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,740
You're so right.

840
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,660
Made noir.

841
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:40,880
OK.

842
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,000
I don't know.

843
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,120
Do I be like a little jerk?

844
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,880
Why don't you find it?

845
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,520
Do it yourself.

846
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,700
Oh my gosh.

847
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,520
What if I play this as if I'm riding?

848
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:58,660
What if I play this as if I make all these decisions like I'm riding Metal Gear?

849
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,020
Why don't you do it yourself?

850
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm not as young as I used to be.

851
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,240
I can't move fast as you if something happens.

852
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,040
There's a utility room on each floor.

853
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,000
There should be a first aid kit there.

854
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,300
Please bring it here.

855
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,800
It would really help me out.

856
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,700
OK.

857
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,860
I guess we're already...

858
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,460
We're already looking around, so...

859
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,080
Oh, this is the elevator.

860
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,080
Sometimes the game like...

861
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,100
It's an indie game, you know?

862
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,920
But see how there's the light flashes and stuff?

863
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,620
It's freaking me out.

864
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,080
Hello?

865
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,560
Hello?

866
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,120
Why is it so dark in here?

867
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,060
Hello?

868
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,100
Oh wait, this room actually has a bunch of stuff.

869
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,920
Damn, they were really living in here.

870
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,160
They have like a whole hamper and everything.

871
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,660
Why are there clothes in the shower?

872
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,800
Artifact jump scare.

873
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,580
Yeah, right?

874
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:14,960
Oh my gosh.

875
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,480
Oh, beans!

876
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,420
What is this?

877
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,440
These are real... Take the pizza!

878
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,560
These are real survivalists over here.

879
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,860
What's this?

880
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,720
What are they building?

881
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,060
Huh?

882
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,420
Wait, what?

883
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,760
What do

884
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,680
you need all that duct tape for?

885
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,180
And batteries.

886
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,080
Search through their bags!

887
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,940
And then they have their...

888
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:48,720
Huh?

889
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,240
This seems kind of sus.

890
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,580
Not gonna lie.

891
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,780
Okay, here we go.

892
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,420
3, 15.

893
00:47:59,260 --> 00:47:59,860
Nope.

894
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,760
3, 16.

895
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:02,840
Nope.

896
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,230
Did you guys hear that?

897
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,540
3, 17.

898
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,360
Oh, nope.

899
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:27,840
Just kidding.

900
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,300
3, 18.

901
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,140
Oh, 3, 17.

902
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,400
Nope.

903
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,560
It's so dark in here.

904
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,500
Hello.

905
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,940
I don't know why.

906
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,300
Creepy ass paintings everywhere.

907
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,740
Can I open it?

908
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,320
No.

909
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,740
It's so dark.

910
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,540
There is no flashlight I think.

911
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,260
3, 20.

912
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,800
Who just has their doors open anyway?

913
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,520
Hello.

914
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,740
Oh yeah.

915
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,200
We got a muscle head here.

916
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,040
They gotta have food.

917
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,480
Animals!

918
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,880
Life of my cat.

919
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:23,860
Yeah!

920
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,060
Yeah!

921
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,100
Let's go.

922
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,240
Let's grab... Okay.

923
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,320
We got fruit.

924
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:31,520
Perfect.

925
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,740
Awesome.

926
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:36,340
Okay.

927
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,320
Onwards.

928
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,020
Bodybuilder.

929
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,180
Yeah, he's gotta have food.

930
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,100
Another one?

931
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,340
Okay.

932
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,540
This is... I'm going the right way, right?

933
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,260
I guess.

934
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,500
These rooms are actually like each unique which is pretty cool.

935
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,240
Oh, what's this?

936
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,700
More gum!

937
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,180
I'll take it.

938
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,960
Someone was having a... I can't tell if it's a bad time or like a great time here.

939
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,280
Oh wow, there is a lot of beer.

940
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,720
Oh, maybe not such a great time.

941
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,500
Oh, you're gonna have to pay for...

942
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,460
Catty!

943
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,060
Lorps!

944
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,720
She is a... Oh my god!

945
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,360
The Catty!

946
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,860
This guy is a dog.

947
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:30,960
Take it?

948
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:31,620
I wish.

949
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,960
It's not time for play though, you guys.

950
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,260
It's time for survival.

951
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,880
It's not time for play.

952
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,680
Wait, which way am I going?

953
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,040
This way?

954
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,820
Oh, that's not so good.

955
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,080
I hear crying.

956
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,780
Oh, I think this is where he is watching me.

957
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,700
Okay, that must be the utility room.

958
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,120
Every time a door opens, it freaks me out so much.

959
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,680
Oh gosh, what's happening to all these rooms?

960
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:21,060
Surely they did not do all of this in less than a day, right?

961
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,880
This is horrible.

962
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,260
Goth GF was floor 4?

963
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,420
Yeah, she was floor 4.

964
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,020
But he said don't leave, so...

965
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,900
I'm gonna listen to the guy for now.

966
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,000
Ew, smelly, smelly, smelly.

967
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,820
Let's get out of here.

968
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,520
We got donuts?

969
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,220
Okay, is this a door?

970
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:50,950
What was that?

971
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,190
I can't see anything.

972
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:56,510
Hold on, I'm gonna see if I can turn the brightness up a little bit.

973
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:58,470
Nope.

974
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:01,710
Nope.

975
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,450
Maybe camera settings?

976
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,370
Nope.

977
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,430
Wait, gamma?

978
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,130
Oh, we can!

979
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,590
Oh my gosh, thank you.

980
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,230
I just saw the blur part.

981
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,790
Okay, does that help at all, you guys?

982
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,480
Yeah, looks better for me too.

983
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,900
This must be the utility room.

984
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,420
Oh, read a note.

985
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,420
Soggy note.

986
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,440
A fragment from someone's diary.

987
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,660
It's wet to the touch.

988
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,240
They always lock the doors to their rooms.

989
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,840
Why?

990
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,220
I already have the keys.

991
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,220
Probably because they are afraid of someone.

992
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,500
Nothing to worry about.

993
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,740
I'll watch over them.

994
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,860
I'm always watching.

995
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,730
Okay, so about that listening to the guy...

996
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,070
About that listen...

997
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:23,330
About that listening to the guy that was, you know...

998
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,730
Saying that he was...

999
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,810
He's watching us?

1000
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,570
Maybe.

1001
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,580
Oh no.

1002
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,360
Uh oh.

1003
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,620
Guys?

1004
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,500
Guys, if we were wise, we wouldn't go over here, right?

1005
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,640
Same safe?

1006
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,060
It was like a misty man.

1007
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,260
What the hell was that?

1008
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,760
Water closet.

1009
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,780
Inspection.

1010
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,840
Is he the one making such a...

1011
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,620
Oh no!

1012
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,040
A mess of the place?

1013
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:22,960
I guess so.

1014
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,860
Good thing he phased out of existence.

1015
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,680
We got a room key 328.

1016
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:30,840
328.

1017
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,560
Nice.

1018
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,300
Someone's in there.

1019
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,640
Someone's in there.

1020
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,020
Okay.

1021
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,240
Oh wait, we're at 333.

1022
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,040
Okay, let's go to 328 then.

1023
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:43,980
Onwards.

1024
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:44,320
Nothing.

1025
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,660
Oh, unlock the door, yeah.

1026
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,620
Oh cool, so we can unlock some of these?

1027
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,800
Oh, not cool.

1028
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,200
They like messed up the room and then were like...

1029
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,840
I will...

1030
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,940
I will lock the door on my way out.

1031
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,700
For privacy's sake.

1032
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,360
Oh my gosh.

1033
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,800
See, things like this, this did not happen in a single day.

1034
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,920
I mean that is, you know, a lot, but...

1035
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,960
Oh my gosh!

1036
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,880
Room...

1037
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,540
Service.

1038
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,400
Don't mind me, I'm just gonna take all of that.

1039
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,440
I'm literally burglaring everything.

1040
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,380
Return to your room with the food.

1041
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,680
Let's go.

1042
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,360
Turn around.

1043
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,200
Slowly.

1044
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,040
No!

1045
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,020
Hello.

1046
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:39,860
Oh god.

1047
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,760
I know I just said I'm a burglar, but please sir.

1048
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,400
Wrath.

1049
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,820
I will ask you questions.

1050
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,800
You will answer them.

1051
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,260
Understood?

1052
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,200
Don't anger me and don't lie.

1053
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,380
This could end badly.

1054
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,600
Tell me, what were you doing in this room?

1055
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,680
This is my room.

1056
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,760
I was looking for medicine.

1057
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,940
Here's a first aid kit.

1058
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,500
No, I was looking for food.

1059
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,460
That's the truth.

1060
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,080
What?

1061
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,020
That makes it more angry?

1062
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,240
You said don't lie.

1063
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,040
So you were stealing.

1064
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,040
Thou shalt not steal.

1065
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,160
It's one of the Ten Commandments.

1066
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,080
How do I know... Oh my god.

1067
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,080
How do I know it wasn't you who killed these people?

1068
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,340
How will you prove it?

1069
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,560
How will you prove that I did it?

1070
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,920
Let's just throw it back in his face.

1071
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,660
Look at the bodies.

1072
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,780
I wouldn't have the strength for that.

1073
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,860
The hotel security guard has access to the cameras.

1074
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,360
He will confirm that it wasn't me.

1075
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,080
It was a woman in white.

1076
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,640
I saw her kill a man.

1077
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,540
The one that shut the door earlier?

1078
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,060
We didn't technically see her kill anyone.

1079
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,280
Three looks like the best option.

1080
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,220
The security guard.

1081
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,980
That's the guy that's helping us, right?

1082
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,540
Do we want to be like, hey, go to that guy?

1083
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,520
What if I'm like, I don't have the strength for that though.

1084
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,720
I wouldn't be able to tear people in two.

1085
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,660
I feel.

1086
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,960
Right, this seems logical.

1087
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,320
Destroy him with facts.

1088
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,060
I've heard what they say on the radio.

1089
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,360
People are capable of terrible things.

1090
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,360
Alright, here's what I think of my son.

1091
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,100
Oh god.

1092
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,140
Get that out of my face please.

1093
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,460
You're one of the infected.

1094
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,840
They said on the radio that you're dangerous.

1095
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,920
You got wild and attacked people.

1096
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,600
And I need to stop you.

1097
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,780
I'm not sick.

1098
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,920
I'll give you one chance.

1099
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,480
What will you say in your defense?

1100
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,440
Uh, radios lie.

1101
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,240
Their explanations keep changing.

1102
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,220
Why do you believe them?

1103
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,300
I don't have a nosebleed.

1104
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,360
I don't see hallucinations.

1105
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,180
I didn't attack you.

1106
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,320
I can control myself.

1107
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:00,620
Uh...

1108
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,000
Four?

1109
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,160
Yeah, true.

1110
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,620
Oh, he doesn't know what to believe.

1111
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,840
Yeah, true.

1112
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,220
Alright my son, I believe you.

1113
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:13,880
Go.

1114
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,040
Don't be afraid.

1115
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,200
Now I'll be watching over you.

1116
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,480
Do you have a spare one of those actually?

1117
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,420
Oh my god, we made it.

1118
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:28,400
Somehow...

1119
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,720
Alright, where was the... 311 is the guy that needs the first aid kit.

1120
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,880
That was jawed faith.

1121
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,120
Hello, did you see all of that?

1122
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,280
Is this entertaining?

1123
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,200
What just happened?

1124
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,920
Wait, huh?

1125
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Actually, did I go down this way?

1126
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,100
Wait, I'm lost.

1127
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,980
I obviously went down this way.

1128
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,740
Where was your CQC boss?

1129
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,520
That way was closed before.

1130
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,480
Oh, was it?

1131
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,860
Oh yeah, to the elevator.

1132
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,620
That's right.

1133
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,140
But it said go to our room.

1134
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,340
I mean, probably doesn't hurt to explore.

1135
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,280
Wait, is this a shortcut?

1136
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:23,520
Shortcut?

1137
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,150
Oh, the elevator I think is broken.

1138
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:33,170
Oh yeah.

1139
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,030
Looking extra cute today.

1140
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:45,330
Yeah, because we went in the... Maybe we went the long way around, I think.

1141
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,050
I keep hearing sounds.

1142
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,050
It's freaking me out.

1143
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,090
Yeah, I think we went the long way around.

1144
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,080
So now we go here.

1145
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,340
To this guy.

1146
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,220
Young man, is that you?

1147
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,560
Did you find the first aid kit?

1148
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,080
Yes, here it is.

1149
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,100
Thank you very much.

1150
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,080
I've put together something for you.

1151
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,100
You may find it useful.

1152
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:23,990
And beans!

1153
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:26,170
Let's go.

1154
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,450
What about your food though?

1155
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,170
You collected all available food on the floor.

1156
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,830
Oh nice.

1157
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,850
Maybe you need something too?

1158
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,670
Sorry, I didn't think of it right away.

1159
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:38,930
It's my damn blood pressure.

1160
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:40,150
You can ask me anything.

1161
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,150
I will try to answer.

1162
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:43,710
Who are you?

1163
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,110
I am a professor.

1164
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:47,930
That is, I was a professor.

1165
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,270
I taught biology at the local institute.

1166
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,670
I've lived in this town all my life.

1167
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,130
Why would he check into a hotel if he already lives in this town?

1168
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,250
He's not telling me something.

1169
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,510
Yeah, everybody is suspicious here.

1170
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,210
Goodness, I'm wasting your time.

1171
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,450
You need to get back to your room.

1172
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,050
I hope this madness ends soon.

1173
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,370
Okay.

1174
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,230
I only asked one thing.

1175
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:17,550
That room is so suspiciously dark right now.

1176
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:23,710
Okay.

1177
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:24,210
Run!

1178
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,930
I'm just going to run to my room.

1179
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:31,450
To my room!

1180
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,290
And shut the door.

1181
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:36,610
Yay!

1182
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,030
We made it!

1183
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,850
Let's put the food in the fridge.

1184
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,010
Nice.

1185
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,070
We are stocked!

1186
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,110
It's a lovely day.

1187
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,210
Turn on the radio.

1188
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:56,570
Anything?

1189
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:57,410
Oh, go to bed.

1190
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,320
This is my station, though.

1191
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,220
We should have taken some of the clothes.

1192
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,000
So we have a change of clothes.

1193
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,280
I'm going to fall asleep to this.

1194
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,240
Good night, world!

1195
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,540
I woke up, I stole food, and now...

1196
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,320
I'm going to sleep.

1197
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,020
I didn't know this inn had maid service.

1198
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,520
Good night.

1199
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,400
This room is huge for a bed that is meant for one person.

1200
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,560
It is the tiniest...

1201
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:46,620
Bed.

1202
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,740
Blood moon.

1203
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:55,740
Who is knocking?

1204
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,380
My door?

1205
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,560
People?

1206
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,820
Please help!

1207
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,440
It was a white lady.

1208
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,020
Go, white lady, go!

1209
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,500
I'm being chased!

1210
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,460
Door, open.

1211
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,000
Wait, didn't we say that we saw a lady kill a guy, though?

1212
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,400
White lady.

1213
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:23,940
Who are you?

1214
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:24,960
Who is chasing you?

1215
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,080
Just open the door!

1216
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,780
Who is chasing you?

1217
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,220
Who is chasing me?

1218
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,920
The door to the room slams shut.

1219
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,040
I can't get inside.

1220
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,380
Please.

1221
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,140
Oh, she is so...

1222
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,560
She can't even form.

1223
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,500
She sounds like she has parasites in her brain.

1224
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:47,840
Open!

1225
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:48,980
Open!

1226
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,400
Open the door!

1227
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,180
Open the door!

1228
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,500
Don't open!

1229
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,500
Open, open, open!

1230
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,100
Open the door for her!

1231
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,240
That's so freaky!

1232
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,000
Open, open, open, open.

1233
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,280
Don't open.

1234
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,040
You are not like the others.

1235
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,260
Interesting.

1236
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,310
That was such a silly...

1237
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,490
Oh my gosh.

1238
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,950
Now she has a wrath thing.

1239
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:19,650
Oh gosh.

1240
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,110
Talk to me.

1241
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,150
I want to know more.

1242
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:23,650
What do you see?

1243
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,970
Oh, she likes compliments.

1244
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,710
I see a beautiful woman.

1245
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:32,850
Is that all?

1246
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,510
So...

1247
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:36,870
Banal.

1248
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,330
What is that?

1249
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,390
What's with the pixelated people?

1250
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,290
We have a condition, I think.

1251
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,170
Right?

1252
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,080
My husband gave me roses for every anniversary.

1253
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,680
I always said that I liked violets more.

1254
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,060
He couldn't remember.

1255
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,160
Oh, what a jerk.

1256
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,380
Now my house is empty.

1257
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,460
I'm looking for someone who won't leave.

1258
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:14,700
Are you too?

1259
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,600
Try to play along.

1260
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,580
I was looking for you.

1261
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,000
Yes, I'm looking for someone.

1262
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,680
I wanted to be alone.

1263
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,780
I think she'll be upset if I say that.

1264
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,020
If I say I'm looking for someone or...

1265
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,960
If I play along...

1266
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,860
She might go crazy and kill me, right?

1267
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:40,920
Number two.

1268
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,140
I'm looking for someone.

1269
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:43,920
Oh, good.

1270
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,800
Someone?

1271
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,240
Not me?

1272
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,000
Not me?

1273
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:48,640
Oh, gosh.

1274
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,260
I knew she was going to get mad that I wasn't looking for her.

1275
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,760
You want to get rid of me.

1276
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:53,860
You're lying.

1277
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,500
The one I need.

1278
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,780
Please, warm me up.

1279
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,160
Liar!

1280
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:02,600
Liar!

1281
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,720
Dreams in the ocean.

1282
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,560
I feel you.

1283
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,680
She's bonkers, you guys.

1284
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,380
Should I trust you?

1285
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,640
Prove that you were listening to me.

1286
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,700
What flowers do I love?

1287
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,480
Violets.

1288
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,820
Chrysanthemums, roses, tulips, violets.

1289
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,340
You listened.

1290
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,660
We won't be alone.

1291
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,220
I can fix her.

1292
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,440
This is your type, everybody.

1293
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,820
You're interesting.

1294
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,960
She's got her arms crossed and everything.

1295
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,050
I guess, is this like...

1296
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,740
I'm confused.

1297
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,110
Is this like the reality or...

1298
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,160
Is the regular lady the reality?

1299
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,040
I'm leaving.

1300
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:50,360
We...

1301
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:51,880
We'll talk again.

1302
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,640
I hope not.

1303
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,380
Oh, gosh.

1304
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,660
She woke me up for that?

1305
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,880
Kind of worth.

1306
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:02,820
You know what?

1307
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,460
I'd let any lady wake me up in the middle of the night.

1308
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:08,620
Whoa.

1309
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,220
Under the sea.

1310
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:18,940
Oh, gosh.

1311
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:19,960
Is this a swimming segment?

1312
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:20,500
Okay, no.

1313
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,100
Under the sea.

1314
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,380
Darling, it's better down where it's wetter.

1315
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,300
Take it from me.

1316
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,160
Wow.

1317
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,120
Oh, my gosh.

1318
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,420
It's suddenly Subnautica.

1319
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:38,760
Ooh.

1320
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:40,940
Wow.

1321
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,200
She did say, like, dreams of the ocean, right?

1322
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,300
I wonder...

1323
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,860
I wonder if when you're infected, you think that...

1324
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,580
Oh, wow.

1325
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,380
Look at that eel.

1326
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:54,720
Wow.

1327
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,140
If you think you're in the ocean.

1328
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,300
Maybe if you are infected, you are actually playing Subnautica.

1329
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,740
It's pretty peaceful, though.

1330
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,940
Yeah, it's kind of nice.

1331
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,300
I wish the whole game was like this.

1332
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,460
Okay, it's getting a little dark.

1333
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,940
I'm gonna... Oh, it's getting...

1334
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,080
Oh.

1335
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,160
It's not so peaceful anymore, I think.

1336
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,460
Okay, that was ruined very quickly.

1337
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:26,780
Oh!

1338
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:29,920
Huh?

1339
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:35,850
Oh, my gosh.

1340
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:40,070
There's... Wait, is that the silhouette lady from the beginning of the game?

1341
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:41,610
Day 2.

1342
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:44,970
Space lady in my bathroom.

1343
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,540
You have survived to the beginning of the second day.

1344
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:57,760
Goth GF!

1345
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,630
Goth GF!

1346
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,410
Where is she yelling from?

1347
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:06,150
Here?

1348
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,690
Oh, my god.

1349
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,390
She's speaking through the walls.

1350
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:13,990
She's in my walls!

1351
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,470
You can crawl through here!

1352
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,410
Oh, my god.

1353
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,810
I can save you.

1354
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:26,850
I hear a voice again.

1355
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,630
Is it her?

1356
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:29,830
Hey, who's there?

1357
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,870
She's in my walls.

1358
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:35,750
Actually, she's perfect!

1359
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,800
Oh, what happened?

1360
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,260
Besides, literally, the end of the world happening right now.

1361
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,020
Oh!

1362
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,680
Maybe be quieter then, if something's at your door.

1363
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,440
Okay.

1364
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,080
I...

1365
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:07,780
I...

1366
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,960
I mean...

1367
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,780
Yeah, good luck, lady!

1368
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,560
Sure hope you find someone!

1369
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,480
Excuse me!

1370
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,440
Try calling the security guy.

1371
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:22,840
Yeah!

1372
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:29,550
Okay!

1373
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:31,990
401?

1374
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,560
Oh, my god.

1375
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:45,880
No!

1376
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,360
I'll wait you here.

1377
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:47,960
No!

1378
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:48,940
No!

1379
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,200
No way!

1380
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,200
Seems like the smoke... There's no fire anymore, at least.

1381
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,580
No way.

1382
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,300
I'll wait you, my queen.

1383
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,090
Oh, listen to the news.

1384
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,930
We are now into the second day of the quarantine.

1385
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:17,030
The situation is deteriorating.

1386
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,190
That's not what you want to hear.

1387
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,470
We are getting reports of deadly attacks from all over the town.

1388
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:26,310
Our studio has lost communication with the Center for Disease Control.

1389
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:28,310
However, we continue to broadcast.

1390
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:33,190
To all our listeners out there, we stand with you.

1391
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:34,550
You are not alone.

1392
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:38,450
I had a dream last night.

1393
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:40,870
I am not alone.

1394
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,390
Oh, no!

1395
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:43,270
I think the news channel is infected!

1396
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,390
They're still playing my music, though.

1397
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,610
Oh, no!

1398
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,810
Hey, I'm gonna call the security guy.

1399
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:56,130
What's his number?

1400
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,150
007, right?

1401
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,790
Hey, can you go get her or something?

1402
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,760
Why is this up to me?

1403
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,040
I'm not going there!

1404
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,420
Oh, it's you.

1405
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,800
The girl on the fourth floor needs help.

1406
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,260
If you have nothing better to do, you can take a risk.

1407
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,140
I'm busy with something.

1408
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,320
So you just like to be nosy.

1409
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,620
You just like to be nosy, but you don't want to be helpful?

1410
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,460
What's up with that?

1411
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,220
Oh, my God.

1412
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,260
What if it's the lady we saw before?

1413
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:37,930
I'm guessing we don't need to go back into any of these rooms, right?

1414
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:39,310
Oh, my goodness.

1415
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:42,210
Like, we got everything in these rooms, so...

1416
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:44,850
He's jorking it?

1417
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:45,610
No!

1418
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:47,010
Don't say that!

1419
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:50,980
Oh, my God.

1420
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,280
Is that her shadow?

1421
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,720
Oh, shit.

1422
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,260
Okay.

1423
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,380
Yes, ma'am.

1424
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:15,360
What's up, Mint?

1425
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:16,760
What's up?

1426
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,400
I'm fine.

1427
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,860
We're just, you know...

1428
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,560
A knock on the door.

1429
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,100
Are you okay?

1430
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,420
Young man, is that you?

1431
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,540
Thank you for yesterday.

1432
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,040
I'll be honest, I can count on you more than my own son.

1433
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,500
He wants something again.

1434
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,240
I better leave.

1435
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,680
Why are we so mean to this guy?

1436
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,520
What happened to your son?

1437
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,300
A few years ago, he fell seriously ill and asked me for help.

1438
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,420
I sent him money for the surgery, but it only helped for a little while.

1439
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:47,700
Soon, another one had to be performed, and another.

1440
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,320
I had to sell my house to pay for the last one.

1441
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,960
And then...

1442
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,440
Thanks for seven months.

1443
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,580
I don't think he was really sick.

1444
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,900
It turned out he was perfectly healthy.

1445
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,940
He got scammed by his own son.

1446
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,800
Did the surgery help?

1447
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,020
We're naive, baby.

1448
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,660
Did the surgery help?

1449
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,400
I'm riding, I'm riding.

1450
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,540
Remember guys, I'm riding.

1451
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,200
Did the surgery help?

1452
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,280
He was pretending all this time.

1453
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,040
This guy is probably like, I'm a professor.

1454
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,740
Thank god this bozo didn't go to my school.

1455
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,480
Babycore, thanks for the gifted.

1456
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,660
He gambled away everything I sent him at the casino.

1457
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,920
All that's left of my life savings is $73.

1458
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,120
Blackjack.

1459
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,040
Oh my god, I rented a room for a couple of days to figure out what to do next.

1460
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,840
A homeless pensioner with three loans.

1461
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,840
I don't know how to live on, and it's not even about the money.

1462
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,380
When a loved one stabs you in the back, you start expecting the next blow from the rest of the world.

1463
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,540
Do you understand me?

1464
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,980
At least you don't have to stress about the loans now.

1465
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,560
We are such a glass half full kind of guy.

1466
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,820
Yes, it seems that it's now the least of my worries.

1467
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:24,900
How ironic.

1468
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,920
$73, some people have all the luck.

1469
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:29,620
No!

1470
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:29,780
No!

1471
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,620
Alright, apparently this lady is walking around here though, so we better...

1472
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,260
Well, that explains that, but also I think she's like right here.

1473
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:46,740
Oh gosh.

1474
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,290
Is she?

1475
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,590
Wait, what is that?

1476
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,390
Is that feet down there?

1477
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,130
Oh god, I'm scared.

1478
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,870
Oh, those are feet.

1479
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:07,350
I had a feeling that would happen.

1480
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:10,930
Let's take the elevator if it's working.

1481
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,330
It's not, of course not.

1482
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:13,230
Let's not do that.

1483
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,590
Okay, we gotta follow the feet steps.

1484
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:17,710
Maybe?

1485
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:19,550
Which way?

1486
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:20,390
Oh gosh.

1487
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,750
Okay, definitely not this way.

1488
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:28,170
How is all of this happening?

1489
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:28,970
What?

1490
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:32,230
Okay.

1491
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,830
I don't think this is such a good idea.

1492
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:37,710
Is that her?

1493
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:41,490
I think that's something.

1494
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:49,370
Like, I think if we told the girl that we also had our own thing that we're dealing with, she would understand, right?

1495
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:52,190
Oh my gosh.

1496
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,270
I can't see what it is.

1497
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,190
It's so scary!

1498
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,310
It's not the lady, is it?

1499
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,930
Hello, MintFatThumb.

1500
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:00,810
Thank you for the soup.

1501
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:01,810
Soup!

1502
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:05,210
HotGothGF.

1503
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:06,850
Okay, I'm gonna be brave!

1504
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:07,670
Brave!

1505
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,820
I'm so glad all of these people are wearing their underwear.

1506
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,820
Why did she take off their clothes first though?

1507
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,220
Is there anyone in here?

1508
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,060
Is she in here?

1509
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,840
Madame of the white dress.

1510
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,640
Are you gonna wear your...

1511
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,100
I got my red dress on tonight.

1512
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,440
Oh, what's this?

1513
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,020
Just kidding, it's nothing.

1514
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,160
What's the point of going in here?

1515
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,640
What was the point of this?

1516
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,440
Unless she wanted to trap me.

1517
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,040
Okay.

1518
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,760
The stairs are right here.

1519
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,570
Oh god!

1520
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:10,470
You forgot about it.

1521
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:11,410
Oh no, she's angry.

1522
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:12,910
She's furious.

1523
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:14,630
If I don't play along, she might attack.

1524
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,350
What did I forget about?

1525
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:17,970
Of course not.

1526
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,830
I remember.

1527
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,810
I brought it.

1528
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,130
I came to talk about it.

1529
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:25,030
What did we forget?

1530
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,870
Oh god, what did we forget?

1531
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,370
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1532
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:29,650
We're so small.

1533
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,450
She's so...

1534
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,510
Look at... Oh my goodness.

1535
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:36,870
I remember.

1536
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,520
You're not just saying that to get out of it, are you?

1537
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,680
I hope not.

1538
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:46,620
Our date.

1539
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:47,840
Restaurant.

1540
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,620
White lady jumpscare.

1541
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:51,740
Wine.

1542
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,580
And meat.

1543
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,000
I'll color the dress in my favorite shade.

1544
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,320
Darling, you remember my favorite color, don't you?

1545
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,260
Did she ever mention that?

1546
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:04,720
Oh my god.

1547
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,380
Black.

1548
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:08,180
Yellow.

1549
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:08,660
Purple.

1550
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:09,680
Green.

1551
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,220
Red.

1552
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,380
Spend gum.

1553
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,000
Oh, we can use our gum!

1554
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,820
Of course I remember.

1555
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,740
And my favorite color is the color of your eyes.

1556
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,220
Violet was her favorite flower.

1557
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,260
I don't think it was her favorite color, right?

1558
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,180
But also the dress was red.

1559
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:31,740
I don't feel like if we pick one of the ones that...

1560
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,180
Maybe we should use the gum.

1561
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:38,780
Maybe.

1562
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:45,230
Riz her up.

1563
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:50,010
I think the gum is like a get out of jail free card, right?

1564
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:51,970
Try the gum.

1565
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,670
You always know what to say.

1566
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,150
We riz'ed her!

1567
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:01,870
This is like a horror game dating sim.

1568
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:02,830
So messed up.

1569
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:05,950
I need to go.

1570
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:07,230
There's still so much to do.

1571
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:08,150
To prepare.

1572
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:13,690
Stop.

1573
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:17,210
And where are you going?

1574
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:21,590
You're not planning to run away, are you?

1575
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:22,890
We're so small.

1576
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:29,290
The girl upstairs needs help.

1577
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,930
I'm going down to... Upstairs?

1578
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:32,710
She's downstairs.

1579
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:34,770
I'm going down to the pool.

1580
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,070
I wanted to check out of the hotel.

1581
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,870
I wanted to book... Oh yeah!

1582
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:39,830
I wanted to book a table!

1583
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,210
You're so thoughtful.

1584
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:48,190
She's back to normal.

1585
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:50,490
It's time for you.

1586
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,450
See you at the restaurant.

1587
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,570
It's time for me to...

1588
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:01,710
We're going downstairs.

1589
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,870
Oh, sorry.

1590
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:06,250
We're going upstairs.

1591
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:08,610
I was right.

1592
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,830
Or not right.

1593
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:12,810
Wait, she's 401, right?

1594
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:13,310
401?

1595
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:16,270
Bird?

1596
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:19,730
I knew that was coming.

1597
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,890
Look at the blood.

1598
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,930
Just like gushing.

1599
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:27,630
Yeah, I knew that was coming.

1600
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,970
We have to be quiet here guys.

1601
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:34,830
We have to be quiet.

1602
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,600
It's loading.

1603
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,480
Oh, saving.

1604
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,140
Thank goodness.

1605
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:44,680
Which way?

1606
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:48,440
I wish there was like a... This way to hot girl.

1607
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,560
Okay, well definitely not that way.

1608
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,400
Oh, nice!

1609
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,020
Oh, it's the freak!

1610
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:56,900
The freak janitor!

1611
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,320
The girl is hiding something in her room.

1612
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,520
Did she steal something?

1613
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,580
Is she on the run?

1614
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,880
I need to search the room while she's not there.

1615
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,320
Huh?

1616
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,620
The girl is hiding something.

1617
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,080
Okay, good to know.

1618
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,240
Can I go into these rooms?

1619
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,320
Nope.

1620
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,000
Nope.

1621
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:19,500
Alright.

1622
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,520
I wonder... I can't tell how many people occupied this...

1623
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:31,220
I can't tell how many people occupied this hotel.

1624
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,580
Okay.

1625
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,760
Oh my god.

1626
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,880
He is bald!

1627
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,400
Alright.

1628
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,780
Maybe the next hallway?

1629
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:50,900
Oh, okay.

1630
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,120
Probably down this way then, right?

1631
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:59,360
Oh gosh!

1632
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,060
Is it this one?

1633
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:04,820
Where is this guy?

1634
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,820
These rooms are way too big.

1635
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,440
Or this hotel is way too big.

1636
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,380
Wow, okay.

1637
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,640
I think we should just take all their stuff.

1638
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,900
It's pre-packed.

1639
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,380
Just take it.

1640
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,680
Is there anything in here?

1641
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,060
Oh, maybe in the bathroom.

1642
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,360
What's the point of letting me come in here if...

1643
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,400
They took all the soaps and everything.

1644
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,360
Why do they have so many soaps?

1645
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,280
I think these guys were robbing the entire hotel.

1646
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,440
They have so many soaps.

1647
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,340
And slippers.

1648
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,600
What is that sound?

1649
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,260
I can't open any of the drawers, so...

1650
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,060
Is there really nothing in here?

1651
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,100
How lame.

1652
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:56,960
Unless in here?

1653
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:57,620
No?

1654
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,060
Okay.

1655
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:01,340
Alright, we continue onward.

1656
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,760
What is that sound?

1657
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,420
Trippy.

1658
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:13,700
Oh,

1659
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,860
poor sap.

1660
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:23,600
This floor looks way worse than our floor.

1661
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,400
I think we got off lucky.

1662
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,900
This floor is... has it pretty rough.

1663
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,540
Not gonna lie.

1664
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,080
Oh gosh, 401, okay.

1665
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:42,730
Wait, 401?

1666
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:46,830
So not this... well, let's check out the rooms first.

1667
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:50,330
I'm just gonna go from the farthest and make our way back.

1668
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,950
Okay.

1669
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,850
Alright, well this one is pretty clean.

1670
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:02,320
I think there is someone in there.

1671
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,040
What are these photos?

1672
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,500
How artsy.

1673
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:11,240
Of you.

1674
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:11,920
Gum!

1675
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,040
Yes.

1676
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,540
I will rob you of your gum.

1677
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,500
What are these photos?

1678
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,240
Oh man, they finished their Chinese food.

1679
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,940
Could have been for us.

1680
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,820
The Riz Gum.

1681
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:28,700
Okay.

1682
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,340
Nope.

1683
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,580
Nope, okay.

1684
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,320
Oh gosh, I think it's down this way, right?

1685
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,560
Still no?

1686
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,380
Oh my god, these hallways are so long.

1687
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,940
It's like the longest... is this a room?

1688
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:52,500
I can't tell.

1689
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,500
Oh my god.

1690
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,160
Okay, well, at least he left.

1691
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,360
Alright.

1692
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,060
He is definitely down this way.

1693
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:16,840
Alright, here we go.

1694
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,160
Oh, there it is.

1695
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:20,620
Okay.

1696
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,960
So we have to find a way to distract it.

1697
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,040
Luckily he didn't hear that.

1698
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,440
And he didn't hear that.

1699
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,860
Oh my god.

1700
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,560
Why are there so many men?

1701
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,560
Why do they strip their clothes?

1702
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,200
Use the soap.

1703
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,660
Why do they strip their clothes?

1704
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,740
Why are they all naked men?

1705
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,820
I don't understand.

1706
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,520
What's going on in this hotel?

1707
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:50,780
Help!

1708
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:57,660
Oh, okay.

1709
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,080
Oh my god.

1710
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,940
God, I need to somehow distract it.

1711
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:09,080
Oh, I need to find the key to the neighboring room.

1712
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,400
Maybe I can lure it there.

1713
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,420
I need to inspect the corridor.

1714
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:13,360
Oh, okay.

1715
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:16,380
Oh, search the body.

1716
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:17,560
There is nothing here.

1717
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,100
One of the bodies should have a key.

1718
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,320
Okay.

1719
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:23,160
I think as long as we don't get close to him, we'll be okay.

1720
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,000
He doesn't move, right?

1721
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:26,300
He just chills right there.

1722
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:27,500
Alright, cool.

1723
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,580
I'm inspecting the bodies.

1724
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:31,920
Nothing as well.

1725
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,040
God, I feel sick.

1726
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,040
Typical business travel.

1727
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:35,640
True.

1728
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,140
Searching the body.

1729
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,860
The key must be somewhere here.

1730
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:40,800
Nothing.

1731
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,520
Morning, Minto.

1732
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,060
Good morning.

1733
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,180
Only blood and torn pieces of clothing.

1734
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,460
How could he tear them up like this?

1735
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,560
At least he leaves their undies.

1736
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:54,700
It's a nudist convention.

1737
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,780
Nothing here either.

1738
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,360
Nothing here.

1739
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,820
Are you?

1740
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:04,580
Oh!

1741
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,360
405.

1742
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:08,420
I need to lure the creature there.

1743
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,500
My hands are bloody.

1744
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,820
What a horrible smell.

1745
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,660
Okay, so I don't have to search anyone else now, right?

1746
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,780
Let me just check.

1747
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,960
No, okay, it won't even let me.

1748
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:21,700
Alright, cool.

1749
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,340
Let's go, baby.

1750
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:26,860
Nothing here.

1751
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,640
Did Gray Fox go through this hall?

1752
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,040
Gray Fox... I think... I don't know.

1753
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:39,000
I think he'd leave them... I think he'd leave them clothed.

1754
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,960
Hey, are you watching this?

1755
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,740
Huh?

1756
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:42,740
You like this?

1757
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,720
You like this show?

1758
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,940
I have nothing to lose, I guess, at this point.

1759
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,320
Oh my god, is he gonna hear me open the door?

1760
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,300
Oh my god.

1761
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,760
Oh my god.

1762
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,900
Okay, we can't open that.

1763
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,840
We can turn on the radio.

1764
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,040
We can...

1765
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,380
None of these open.

1766
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,280
Examine the radio.

1767
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,780
Rotate the radio.

1768
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:30,960
Is this where I put in batteries or something?

1769
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,940
Open battery compartment.

1770
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,120
Oh, it has batteries.

1771
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:34,420
Okay.

1772
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,960
Extract the batteries?

1773
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:42,860
Put away the radio.

1774
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,420
Oh, if I turn the radio on...

1775
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,100
Moko-chan?

1776
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,220
Is it Moko-chan?

1777
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:58,380
If I turn on the radio right now, he would come running right away and I would die.

1778
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:02,080
So... Is there something?

1779
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:04,940
Examine the... Oh, this is a clock!

1780
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,440
I see, I see, I see.

1781
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:13,100
Okay, so then we put the batteries in the clock.

1782
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:19,900
Moko-chan, save me.

1783
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,920
Save me, Bao-Bao.

1784
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:23,640
Rotate the clock.

1785
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,680
How fast do you think I can get out of here?

1786
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:36,580
Set a timer for... 30 seconds I think is fine.

1787
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,580
No, Bao-Bao.

1788
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:45,090
15 seconds, no balls.

1789
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,370
Let's do 45.

1790
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,590
I'm scared.

1791
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:50,630
Oh god.

1792
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,030
Escape from the room.

1793
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:52,950
Okay, I'm going.

1794
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:06,490
Oh my god, am I going to have to hear this the entire time?

1795
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:07,990
Can I just stand here?

1796
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:11,230
I've escaped far enough.

1797
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:14,930
What did I say?

1798
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,970
I didn't say fart, did I?

1799
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,290
No way.

1800
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:21,910
I gotta close the door probably?

1801
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:22,730
Oh, maybe.

1802
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:25,730
I said that?

1803
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,780
I said 45!

1804
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,380
Did he go?

1805
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:48,800
Oh, I think he went.

1806
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,490
Oh, I don't think I was supposed to do that.

1807
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:01,350
Maybe I was.

1808
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:02,210
Let me in!

1809
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,420
Oh my god, hot girl.

1810
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,980
Why do you get like the cutest room in the whole hotel?

1811
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,260
Oh my god, where is your clothes?

1812
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,980
Oh, hot girl smell.

1813
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:27,200
Wow, oh my god, this looks just... it suits you perfectly.

1814
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,320
Oh my gosh, we are in a bedroom!

1815
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,440
Hello.

1816
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:33,700
Yeah!

1817
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:40,120
Okay, we are packing.

1818
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,660
Why haven't you packed him yet?

1819
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:51,940
Oh, so instead you yelled down the... down the vent at me?

1820
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,480
Okay.

1821
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,800
Okay, anything we need.

1822
01:32:59,040 --> 01:32:59,460
Everything.

1823
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,900
Where is... oh gosh, we have a timer.

1824
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,560
The bag?

1825
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,320
What's the bag?

1826
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,360
Take the bag.

1827
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:06,600
Take.

1828
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,080
Take your clothes.

1829
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:08,960
Take the pizza.

1830
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,000
Take... whatever that... take the bag.

1831
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,780
Take your other clothes.

1832
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:16,880
What's this?

1833
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,700
The church of Jonah?

1834
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:19,780
Take it?

1835
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:20,820
I don't know what that is.

1836
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,600
Oh my god.

1837
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,200
Oh my god.

1838
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:24,600
Oh my god.

1839
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,340
Okay, hold on.

1840
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:29,700
I'm taking the water.

1841
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,100
Nevermind.

1842
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,340
Oh, take... open the fridge?

1843
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:32,980
Take everything in the fridge?

1844
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,420
Ma'am, why can't you move it?

1845
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,300
Ma'am, I'm trying to get us...

1846
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,100
Take your clothes?

1847
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,320
You're welcome.

1848
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,520
What's under here?

1849
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,900
Move the... what's this?

1850
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:51,420
Cash.

1851
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:52,000
Welcome to the membership.

1852
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:52,780
Thank you.

1853
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:55,600
Okay.

1854
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:57,740
Oh, what is this?

1855
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:00,420
Okay.

1856
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:00,920
Okay.

1857
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:01,820
Oh, I see them.

1858
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,520
Look under the bed.

1859
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:05,720
What if I don't take the package?

1860
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,940
Collected all the things in the girls room.

1861
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:13,540
Okay.

1862
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:15,400
Can I get up?

1863
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:16,240
Wait.

1864
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,240
I can't get up.

1865
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:17,680
Oh, get up.

1866
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:20,860
I'm lying on the ground.

1867
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:22,620
What is this thing?

1868
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:23,700
Take?

1869
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,740
What is this?

1870
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,900
I'm worried about it.

1871
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:34,820
I think we're good.

1872
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:35,580
I'm ready.

1873
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:40,640
Yeah.

1874
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,200
Okay.

1875
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:42,580
Let's go.

1876
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:45,500
Oh my god.

1877
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:50,640
She's just so calm and cool and collected.

1878
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:50,940
Oh.

1879
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:51,800
Hello?

1880
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,720
Shut up.

1881
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:56,920
It's right there.

1882
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,080
Please shut up.

1883
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,560
Please shut up.

1884
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:01,440
Please shut up.

1885
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:02,160
Oh my god.

1886
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:04,960
Oh my god.

1887
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,280
Oh god, girl.

1888
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:13,540
You were the one who told me not to make any noise and you're saying all this stuff yourself.

1889
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,360
Girl!

1890
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,700
Can't go down there.

1891
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,560
I guess we just follow her the whole time, right?

1892
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,160
Okay, she doesn't want to run anymore.

1893
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:24,800
That's fine.

1894
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,200
She's catwalking.

1895
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:32,960
Hide where?

1896
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:37,840
Hide where?

1897
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:49,300
Hold down the keys to hold your breath.

1898
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:02,170
Oh my god.

1899
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,650
Please leave.

1900
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,250
I guess I can breathe now.

1901
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:14,810
I guess we're fine.

1902
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:16,070
Did you do that?

1903
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:20,550
Oh my gosh.

1904
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:23,650
Anyway.

1905
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:26,730
No shit.

1906
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:27,630
What?

1907
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:30,850
Let's continue onwards.

1908
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:36,650
Yeah.

1909
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,150
Goth GF kind of dumb.

1910
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:42,270
I like her like that.

1911
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,650
Oh.

1912
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:47,010
Nice.

1913
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:47,330
Nice.

1914
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:54,650
Yeah, it's kind of my room.

1915
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:58,230
Sorry for the mess and everything.

1916
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:01,550
Oh!

1917
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:03,430
Sexy music.

1918
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:09,010
Yeah.

1919
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:13,010
Yeah.

1920
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:14,690
Yeah, a lot of food.

1921
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:20,730
Oh, she's praising me.

1922
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:24,530
I have no clothes.

1923
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:29,750
I came here with just a backpack.

1924
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:35,790
Alright, we killed it you guys.

1925
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:36,650
Let's go.

1926
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:45,410
Mi casa es tu casa.

1927
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,390
Sorry that I'm asking you just now.

1928
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:54,030
Can I stay with you for a couple of days?

1929
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:56,530
I've nowhere to go.

1930
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:02,250
302 is empty though.

1931
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:03,830
If you don't mind the meat.

1932
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:07,210
Besides, the two of us will be safer together.

1933
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:12,990
Tell me about the package.

1934
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,270
Tell me about the brochure.

1935
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:15,750
I didn't get to really look at it.

1936
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,750
It said something about Jonah.

1937
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,090
Yeah, I guess.

1938
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:22,390
This guy is so nonchalant.

1939
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:25,790
Yeah, I guess.

1940
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:30,150
I want to know what the package is though.

1941
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:37,950
Papers and personal stuff?

1942
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:40,530
Tell me about the brochure.

1943
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:49,270
Okay.

1944
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,070
Yeah, I guess.

1945
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:55,170
What would Raiden do?

1946
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:02,860
Oh, Gatouyan.

1947
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,660
On the bed, I will sleep on the couch?

1948
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:09,940
What?

1949
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,740
On the couch, I will sleep on the bed?

1950
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,740
No, I'm no fiend.

1951
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:17,800
Actually, I think though Raiden would probably take the bed.

1952
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,600
I'm not gonna lie.

1953
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,400
Where's the option?

1954
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,320
There's enough room in the bed for the both of us.

1955
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,660
The game budget truly went to the GF.

1956
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:38,190
Where do you want to sleep, you guys?

1957
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:38,890
Where do you want to sleep?

1958
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:43,770
What if we sleep on the bed and then she's just like...

1959
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:44,450
Oh, sorry.

1960
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:46,190
It was really cold on the couch.

1961
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:48,250
Is it fine if I take the bed?

1962
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:50,290
We can stay there together.

1963
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:51,970
That's kind of the strat.

1964
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:55,670
If I give her the bed, she'll automatically be warm.

1965
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:57,130
One.

1966
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:00,950
You guys are such a gentleman and ladies.

1967
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:05,550
Okay.

1968
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:12,710
She's like, I got a really bad back.

1969
01:40:12,770 --> 01:40:14,290
I can't sleep on the couch.

1970
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:19,850
And one more thing.

1971
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:23,450
I completely forgot to say that...

1972
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:24,730
That you love me?

1973
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:26,110
My name is Robin.

1974
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:26,970
Robin.

1975
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:28,830
Robin.

1976
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,950
She's a burglar.

1977
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:36,030
She's robbing me of all my belongings.

1978
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:39,950
Nice to meet you.

1979
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,890
And I'm Batman.

1980
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:46,310
Call me Bruce Wayne.

1981
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:50,090
What if we were such a freak?

1982
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:52,230
It's raining.

1983
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:58,510
It's not raining.

1984
01:40:58,690 --> 01:40:59,390
We're underwater.

1985
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:02,770
Is she calling?

1986
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:03,410
Is that her?

1987
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:11,640
She's not here.

1988
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,640
She's taking a bath.

1989
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,800
No she's not.

1990
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:18,760
What?

1991
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,380
She wants to go outside.

1992
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:21,900
She's trying to kill me.

1993
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:33,060
Goodbye room.

1994
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,080
I hope I'm not actually leaving.

1995
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,820
You guys, am I possessed?

1996
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,520
Am I infected?

1997
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,080
Am I possessed?

1998
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:42,720
Infected?

1999
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,000
I don't know what the heck it is.

2000
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:44,820
Do you become possessed?

2001
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:45,620
Do you become infected?

2002
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:50,200
It feels supernatural, but they said it would...

2003
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,060
That's not Robin.

2004
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:58,960
Infected.

2005
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,200
Maybe hallucinations?

2006
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,620
Hello madam.

2007
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,180
Lady Galaxy.

2008
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,760
I've been waiting for you.

2009
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,060
I'm glad you finally came.

2010
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,660
It was so scary outside, isn't it?

2011
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:17,300
So many people.

2012
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:19,620
She kind of gets me.

2013
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:22,380
Everyone wants something.

2014
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,360
A man with a gun.

2015
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:25,280
Priest.

2016
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:26,680
Do you remember him?

2017
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,340
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

2018
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:36,520
Thanks for the 20 captain!

2019
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:36,640
Good!

2020
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:42,160
Thank you, thank you!

2021
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,640
He was full of anger.

2022
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,080
He almost killed you.

2023
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:48,740
Oh, he sounds insane.

2024
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,900
He tried to do the right thing.

2025
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:53,760
He was scared like me.

2026
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,040
Oh gosh, what would Raiden do?

2027
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:03,200
WWRD

2028
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:12,680
Two or three?

2029
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,420
Those are the options that make me seem the nicest.

2030
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,880
I don't know if it's the right thing.

2031
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,040
Well, he did try to see if I was infected.

2032
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:26,920
And he was killing off the ones that are infected.

2033
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:28,200
So I guess it's kind of fine.

2034
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,540
He tried to do the right thing.

2035
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,080
And this justifies his actions?

2036
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,080
Interesting conclusion.

2037
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:35,880
The Watcher.

2038
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:37,100
He tells you what to do.

2039
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,600
He never came out to help.

2040
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:40,220
Neither you nor the girl.

2041
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,560
What do you think about him?

2042
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,000
All he can do is...

2043
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,600
Sorry, I know I keep bringing up Metal Gear and Raiden.

2044
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:54,560
But it's like when you are in a codec with someone...

2045
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,660
And when you press R1 versus L1...

2046
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:01,800
And it's like his positive thoughts versus his upset thoughts.

2047
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:04,620
So it's just like, all he can do is command.

2048
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,740
That's what I feel about these.

2049
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:14,060
Do it yourself.

2050
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:20,380
I'm ready to tolerate him as long as he's useful.

2051
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,080
He saved me and he helps me as best he can.

2052
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,080
I don't know about that.

2053
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,440
I don't think he helps me.

2054
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:28,840
What do you mean the best he can?

2055
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,340
We don't know anything about this guy.

2056
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,440
I'm ready to tolerate him as long as he's useful.

2057
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,180
That's the right attitude.

2058
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:39,300
Use him and don't let him sit on your neck.

2059
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:42,300
Because he's already planning how to use you.

2060
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,660
The girl, you saved her.

2061
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,400
You let her into your room.

2062
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,060
You even gave her your bed.

2063
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,420
Poor naive boy.

2064
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,080
Ashes!

2065
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,880
I'm late to stream and the first thing I hear is you finally came.

2066
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:00,840
I feel very called out right now.

2067
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:06,420
Yeah, I mean, welcome.

2068
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,600
You still don't even know who she is.

2069
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,300
Don't you think she's too friendly?

2070
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:13,920
She's using me.

2071
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,140
She's hiding something.

2072
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:16,160
I mean, she is.

2073
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,700
She just wants to survive.

2074
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,920
That seems to be the case, right?

2075
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:21,920
She just wants to survive.

2076
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:23,640
Of course.

2077
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,440
What is she ready to do for this?

2078
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,080
Who is she willing to sacrifice?

2079
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,560
Look at them.

2080
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,320
People like them are everywhere.

2081
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:39,380
They come only when they need something.

2082
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,800
And then they leave.

2083
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,660
They always leave.

2084
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:47,900
You came here so that this wouldn't happen again.

2085
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,800
But they found you even here.

2086
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,300
They don't want you.

2087
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,460
They want what you are capable of.

2088
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,120
I'm the chosen one.

2089
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,020
Chosen one!

2090
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,240
And you don't need anyone.

2091
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:04,160
Who are you?

2092
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,000
Kazoo kid.

2093
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:08,860
Wait a second.

2094
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:10,640
You'll remember.

2095
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,000
The important thing is that I'm back and I won't leave you anymore.

2096
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:18,460
Is she like maybe the lady in the photograph?

2097
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,500
Maybe it's my mom.

2098
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:22,620
In the photograph.

2099
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:24,860
Take meds?

2100
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,060
The meds let me see women!

2101
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,420
I'm never taking my meds!

2102
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:33,340
Girls!

2103
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:34,760
Girls!

2104
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,380
Welcome to Babusha!

2105
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:44,060
But it's time for you to leave.

2106
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,620
We have a lot of things to do.

2107
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,540
Is this why I'm sleeping in the bathroom?

2108
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:51,400
Because I'm...

2109
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,420
I'm sleeping in the tub every night.

2110
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,580
Day 3 baby!

2111
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,440
Superball, thanks for 5 months.

2112
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:01,640
Wait, there is blood now on the floor.

2113
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,200
Why is there blood on the floor now?

2114
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:15,890
Kazoo too hard.

2115
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:19,930
Nosebleed?

2116
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:25,130
Wash your face.

2117
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:30,190
No, we just nicked ourselves from shaving.

2118
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:30,910
That's all.

2119
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:34,030
It's just a little scratch, you know?

2120
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,390
We're so clumsy.

2121
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:47,090
She's playing some sexy music this morning.

2122
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:52,290
Gosh, I had the greatest dream about a hot girl.

2123
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:58,130
I went and saved her from her room and she was all goth and just so beautiful.

2124
01:47:58,650 --> 01:47:59,990
Too bad it was just a dream.

2125
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:10,360
It's a thumbnail.

2126
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:11,640
Oh, hello.

2127
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:13,160
Good morning!

2128
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:19,320
I'm aesthetics.

2129
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:22,120
It's the aesthetic to sleep on the bathroom.

2130
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,800
I thought you would sleep on the couch.

2131
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:26,260
I did actually say I was gonna be on the couch.

2132
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,820
Lie, lie, stay silent.

2133
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,820
Lie, it's safer there.

2134
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:39,720
Wait, so it's not because it's safer in there that I sleep in the bathroom?

2135
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,240
That's what I thought it was.

2136
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:44,200
Why is she moving like a robot?

2137
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:46,320
Bebop, Egypt.

2138
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:47,620
Bebop.

2139
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:49,860
Be goth.

2140
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:50,700
Bebop.

2141
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,320
I'm human.

2142
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:55,620
I felt sick in the morning.

2143
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:56,780
Now everything is alright.

2144
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:58,360
Okay, then she would think I'm infected.

2145
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:00,250
Which I am, probably, but...

2146
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:06,900
Stay silent?

2147
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,100
Or I don't know.

2148
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,200
I like how the cups go...

2149
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:14,500
Oh yeah, is this breakfast?

2150
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:15,840
Three Doritos?

2151
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:22,180
Three Doritos chips, an apple, a donut and a banana.

2152
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:23,720
Hot dog!

2153
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,080
All the nutritional value.

2154
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:32,780
Why is it a lie though?

2155
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:34,700
I'm gonna try that it's safer there.

2156
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,420
Yeah, don't judge me.

2157
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:55,300
What do you mean it didn't turn out very well?

2158
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:56,920
You're acting like you cooked this.

2159
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,800
I crafted this breakfast with my own two hands.

2160
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:06,020
I foraged this banana and this apple.

2161
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:15,400
And I fried this donut using the tears of my own soul.

2162
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:17,020
What do you mean?

2163
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:19,880
I will.

2164
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:21,660
I collected all of this, honestly.

2165
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:31,560
She's so quiet compared to the music.

2166
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,180
She slaved away to make that meal for you.

2167
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,400
I know, I'm a monster.

2168
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,500
Thank you for the month, Redoh.

2169
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,240
Thank you.

2170
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,200
Sounds like we are in someone's nightmare.

2171
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,660
Some kind of disease.

2172
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,560
It looks like the end of the world.

2173
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:47,940
One word.

2174
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:49,560
Aliens.

2175
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:54,500
Aliens.

2176
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:02,100
So, we do have monsters, but we don't even have one flying saucer.

2177
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:03,880
It's disappointing.

2178
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:06,240
Oh my god, she's so real for this.

2179
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:07,480
It's disappointing.

2180
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:08,320
So true.

2181
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,860
What do you think about the Watcher?

2182
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:12,580
What do you think about that pale monster?

2183
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:14,920
What do you think about that white lady?

2184
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:21,900
What do you think about the Watcher?

2185
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:23,440
Security guy?

2186
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,480
I called him yesterday.

2187
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,780
He spoke very confidently.

2188
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:33,040
I think we can trust him, but I don't know why he doesn't leave his room.

2189
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:34,560
Suspicious, huh?

2190
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:35,300
Oh, let's eat.

2191
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:40,440
Why did you come to the city?

2192
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,820
Tell me honestly, what were you hiding behind the chair?

2193
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,400
Where are your parents?

2194
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,120
Yeah, what were you hiding behind the chair?

2195
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,740
I told you.

2196
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,140
Nothing special.

2197
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:55,120
My documents, personal stuff.

2198
01:51:55,720 --> 01:52:00,140
It doesn't matter now, but you never know who could come in and...

2199
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:01,820
Then?

2200
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:05,080
The phone is ringing.

2201
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,800
You need to answer.

2202
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,620
This is probably something important.

2203
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,600
Phone is ringing.

2204
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:16,080
I'm gonna... Oh my god.

2205
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,660
We can get so close to her.

2206
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:22,860
We can almost see her face.

2207
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:24,680
Does she have blue eyes?

2208
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:25,960
Oh my god.

2209
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,080
Okay, I'll get the phone.

2210
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,540
But we're not done here, missy.

2211
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:34,260
Pick up the phone.

2212
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:37,800
Hey, how's it going, kid?

2213
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,060
Don't bother answering.

2214
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:39,880
I can guess.

2215
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:45,000
I've lost contact with the police and I can't get through to the rescuers.

2216
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:49,380
It seems that due to the riots in the city, some telephone lines have been cut off.

2217
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:51,080
That's a major bummer.

2218
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,620
That's an understatement.

2219
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:59,300
Her face is so lewd they had to censor it.

2220
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:03,460
Yeah, I'll call the church right after this.

2221
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,800
But I've got a plan.

2222
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:06,840
There's a big antenna on the roof of the hotel.

2223
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:10,500
If we can tweak it, I might be able to radio someone from the rescue team.

2224
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,160
But here's the thing.

2225
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,540
You're the one who's going to have to climb up there.

2226
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:19,300
Why me and not you?

2227
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:21,740
I need to keep an eye on the cameras.

2228
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,620
Anything can go wrong any second.

2229
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,380
I need to make sure no one gets hurt.

2230
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:29,940
And if someone does get hurt, what are you going to do about it?

2231
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,060
Climb the stairs to the top floor.

2232
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,460
There's a restaurant there.

2233
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:38,760
You think she's going to be there?

2234
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,400
Our lucky lady?

2235
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:41,640
Our white lady?

2236
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:47,760
There's a restaurant there through which you can get out onto the roof.

2237
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:51,500
Find the antenna and contact me via the local phone.

2238
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,340
Don't take the girl with you.

2239
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:55,300
You're making too much noise while you're together.

2240
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:58,760
We're being too goofy silly in the hallways.

2241
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:01,140
We're just like goofy silly girls.

2242
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:06,120
We're just like giggling and you know, we're just like catwalking.

2243
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,360
We're strutting down those hallways.

2244
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:09,680
We're being so silly.

2245
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:15,860
I need to look at the cameras so that if something goes wrong, I can send you to deal with it.

2246
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:16,620
Exactly!

2247
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,460
This guy is such a coward.

2248
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:19,680
Good luck.

2249
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:20,800
Oh, okay.

2250
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,940
Do you need to go upstairs?

2251
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah.

2252
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,600
Sorry, I heard that part of the call.

2253
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:28,640
Yeah?

2254
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:33,160
You know, I'm not going to just sit on your neck.

2255
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:36,520
I'll go downstairs and see what's going on on the first floor.

2256
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:38,600
Do you need anything in particular?

2257
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:43,000
What does that mean, sit on my neck?

2258
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,880
You can?

2259
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:46,140
Please do?

2260
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:47,740
What's wrong with you guys?

2261
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:53,110
You guys are so...

2262
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:03,020
Oh, let's see.

2263
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:04,980
Stay here is not worth the risk.

2264
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:06,200
Look for food and supplies.

2265
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:08,160
Check what the guard is doing there.

2266
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:09,520
Try to find a way to escape.

2267
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:12,160
I don't think we need to leave.

2268
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,440
Because...

2269
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:19,300
I think the hotel is probably the safest place to be, honestly.

2270
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:23,520
But, stay here is not worth the risk.

2271
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:27,300
Do we risk sending out our Goth GF?

2272
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:28,760
What if she never comes home?

2273
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:38,280
Check out what the guard is doing there.

2274
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,230
I don't know.

2275
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:49,950
I think we ate a donut and three potato chips.

2276
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:51,470
We are going to die at this rate.

2277
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:53,810
I'm going to tell her to stay here though.

2278
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:56,610
What if she dies if she goes downstairs?

2279
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:59,050
I'm going to tell her to stay here.

2280
01:55:59,090 --> 01:55:59,530
Stay here.

2281
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:00,610
Are you sure?

2282
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:01,170
Yeah.

2283
01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:03,890
Fine.

2284
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:06,870
OK.

2285
01:56:07,330 --> 01:56:07,670
Cool.

2286
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:08,110
OK.

2287
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:09,610
Now let's call...

2288
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:11,890
Whatever this is.

2289
01:56:11,950 --> 01:56:14,970
66-112.

2290
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:20,150
And I also want to call this foster place again and see if anything changed.

2291
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:20,610
You know?

2292
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:26,890
If the woman visits, just don't answer the door.

2293
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:30,550
Hello, you've called the church of Jonah's side.

2294
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:34,330
This looks like the symbol from Fullmetal Alchemist.

2295
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:38,650
If you want to learn more about our church, press 1.

2296
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:41,410
If you want to hear a new message for Jonah's followers, press 2.

2297
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:45,270
For information about lost souls... Oh, that's me.

2298
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:46,250
3.

2299
01:56:50,150 --> 01:56:55,150
One of our sisters from Nunneva has gone missing.

2300
01:56:56,750 --> 01:57:00,270
Her parents, friends, and church brethren miss her and pray for her.

2301
01:57:02,590 --> 01:57:08,150
It is the duty of every brother and sister in our friendly community to return the lost sheep to the flock.

2302
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:13,770
Ask your pastor about her features and pass on information about her if you see her.

2303
01:57:15,090 --> 01:57:15,610
Aha.

2304
01:57:18,770 --> 01:57:21,290
If you want to learn more about our church, press 1.

2305
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:22,890
Let's press 1.

2306
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:28,270
The sign of Jonah teaches us about the benefits of solitude and isolation.

2307
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:30,450
Okay, you're selling it?

2308
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:35,730
Only by isolating ourselves from the world and focusing on self-knowledge can we rise above sin.

2309
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:41,230
We will teach you to accept solitude and become a shining torch that punishes vices.

2310
01:57:41,230 --> 01:57:43,930
Do I have to do work?

2311
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:47,010
If you want to hear a message, press 2.

2312
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:50,770
This is the message.

2313
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:53,590
The hour has come, brothers and sisters.

2314
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:55,270
Go out and preach.

2315
01:57:55,650 --> 01:58:00,270
The Great Whale has appeared to swallow sinners and bring them to God.

2316
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:04,310
There is only you and him.

2317
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:05,290
Save.

2318
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:06,330
Punish.

2319
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:08,970
Follow the path of the One.

2320
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:11,730
Okay.

2321
01:58:13,210 --> 01:58:13,810
Hang up.

2322
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:15,930
Interesting.

2323
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:17,810
And then 662525.

2324
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:23,870
Because remember they said last time, they were like, something happened at your...

2325
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:26,030
At your foster place.

2326
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:28,630
Oh my God, my nose got...

2327
01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:30,090
I didn't pick up.

2328
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:33,410
My nose got so stuffy all of a sudden.

2329
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:35,230
Okay, I'll be back later, ma'am.

2330
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:38,350
Oh my God, the little cutouts.

2331
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:39,910
Wow, I like her necklace even.

2332
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,370
She is so cute.

2333
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:45,990
God, she is so smoking hot.

2334
01:58:46,050 --> 01:58:46,990
How did we get so lucky?

2335
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:51,270
Thank you, woman, for being...

2336
01:58:51,270 --> 01:58:51,810
You know what?

2337
01:58:52,690 --> 01:58:53,790
Thank you, Apocalypse.

2338
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:55,890
What the hell is going on with this song?

2339
01:58:57,030 --> 01:59:00,370
Thank you, Apocalypse, for bringing this beauty upon me.

2340
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:02,410
Urgent news.

2341
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:05,230
Contact with rescue services have been lost and...

2342
01:59:08,070 --> 01:59:11,590
This morning I sat and looked out the window...

2343
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:12,230
And I realized...

2344
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:13,610
I'm empty.

2345
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:15,890
It's not a cult.

2346
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:19,490
It's a tight-knit community that cares for each other.

2347
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:22,570
You city slickers don't know what real community is.

2348
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,010
Yeah, it's not a cult.

2349
01:59:24,850 --> 01:59:25,730
It's not a cult.

2350
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:31,750
I realized I'm empty.

2351
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:33,450
At least for you.

2352
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:33,450
Hello.

2353
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:35,050
I'm a voice in the background.

2354
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:40,150
I deliver news and tell stories that will turn into a dream as soon as you change the channel.

2355
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:46,110
But even these messages are more real to you than I am.

2356
01:59:46,690 --> 01:59:50,130
You realize that I exist only when I stammer or mix up my words.

2357
01:59:50,930 --> 01:59:53,690
In your eyes, I am the embodiment of a mistake.

2358
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:57,870
Without a body, without life beyond the ether...

2359
01:59:57,870 --> 01:59:58,530
A mistake.

2360
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:01,610
Only then do I appear.

2361
02:00:01,610 --> 02:00:04,330
The NPC realizes it's an NPC.

2362
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:07,550
It's becoming aware.

2363
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:12,390
Today I will kill a man.

2364
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:18,830
Well, will you notice me now?

2365
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:24,990
You're gonna play the Pink Panther after that?

2366
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:41,980
Alright, time to go to the rooftop, baby.

2367
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:43,700
Oh.

2368
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:45,740
Yeah, Robin?

2369
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,540
Thanks, Robin.

2370
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:52,020
Oh.

2371
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,720
Lock the door.

2372
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:55,720
Keep it shut.

2373
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,580
If I open it back up, will she still be there?

2374
02:00:59,040 --> 02:00:59,600
Oh, yep.

2375
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,480
She's waiting for me like a little puppy.

2376
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:03,780
Okay.

2377
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:05,920
Alright.

2378
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:10,040
It's a little spooky, but...

2379
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,080
You know, we've handled things.

2380
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:14,720
Never ask a white lady her age.

2381
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,220
A security guard his...

2382
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:18,340
salary.

2383
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:22,220
Or a goth GF the contents of her mysterious package.

2384
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:27,020
Oh, this guy.

2385
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,220
You still in here?

2386
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:30,780
I heard someone wandering along the corridor.

2387
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:32,240
Corridor.

2388
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:34,480
Go back to your room, young man.

2389
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,240
Sadly, that is...

2390
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:40,700
not an option for me to...

2391
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:43,440
continue the game.

2392
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,420
Oh, it's my...

2393
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,020
lady and wife.

2394
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:50,060
Oh, there she goes.

2395
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:52,220
Get it?

2396
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:54,660
I would say lady and wife, but...

2397
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,900
I upped our title.

2398
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,920
You're the lady and...

2399
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:02,280
I wish we could use the elevator.

2400
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:05,240
So I don't have to walk all the way over.

2401
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:09,580
She's not down here.

2402
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,160
Surely I don't have to go through these rooms again, right?

2403
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,560
Were these scratch marks here before?

2404
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:20,420
Oh, the bodies are gone.

2405
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:22,440
Well, they're knocked over.

2406
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:24,900
Who did that?

2407
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,480
It was such a...

2408
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,240
Such a lovely display.

2409
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:29,660
Oh, God.

2410
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:32,400
The texture's loading and it freaked me out.

2411
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,240
Is she down here?

2412
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:33,800
Okay, no.

2413
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,280
Okay.

2414
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,600
The dress is gone.

2415
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:38,920
She's gonna wear it for our date tonight.

2416
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:40,960
Alright, so we're going...

2417
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:41,280
upstairs.

2418
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:44,140
To the rooftop.

2419
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,000
That bird's still here.

2420
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:48,900
Okay.

2421
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:51,320
Fourth floor.

2422
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:53,480
And keep on...

2423
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,080
Oh?

2424
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:02,120
A squid?

2425
02:03:04,660 --> 02:03:06,820
I think I'm hallucinating, you guys.

2426
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:08,800
Guys, I think we're...

2427
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,680
Actually, I can't tell what is a hallucination and what is...

2428
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:15,960
What is just normal in this new universe.

2429
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:20,760
What is normal now?

2430
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,240
For...

2431
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:25,620
For this place.

2432
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:26,620
Okay, fifth floor.

2433
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:31,200
Ah...

2434
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,860
Oh, it's actually really clean up here.

2435
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:36,220
Okay, nice.

2436
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:38,460
Maybe this area hasn't been touched.

2437
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:46,050
Maybe we're fine.

2438
02:03:48,170 --> 02:03:48,610
Oh.

2439
02:03:50,130 --> 02:03:51,390
Oh, just kidding.

2440
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:54,290
It was wishful thinking.

2441
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:57,690
Yeah, we know it's broken.

2442
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:00,290
Blue's Night.

2443
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:02,830
September 11th, 1993.

2444
02:04:03,410 --> 02:04:04,570
The Sanity Inn.

2445
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:08,190
She's waiting for you in our restaurant.

2446
02:04:09,490 --> 02:04:10,390
What the hell does that mean?

2447
02:04:10,770 --> 02:04:11,950
Squid plus goth girl.

2448
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:13,910
I've seen enough H to know where this is going.

2449
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:20,130
Did you ever figure out the one word you were searching for...

2450
02:04:20,130 --> 02:04:21,910
for the emotion you've been feeling recently?

2451
02:04:24,670 --> 02:04:25,230
IBS?

2452
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:25,470
IBS?

2453
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:27,510
Huh?

2454
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:30,750
Is it in there?

2455
02:04:30,850 --> 02:04:31,550
Wait, what's in here?

2456
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:33,110
Nothing.

2457
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:33,790
Okay.

2458
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:36,090
The music is so...

2459
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:36,450
loud.

2460
02:04:38,690 --> 02:04:40,990
Okay, is there gonna be like a boss fight in here?

2461
02:04:41,090 --> 02:04:41,830
What is...

2462
02:04:41,830 --> 02:04:42,890
What's with this atmosphere?

2463
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:44,050
I can't see anything.

2464
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:48,330
Oh my god!

2465
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:50,290
It's one of those...

2466
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:51,730
little...

2467
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:52,510
T-Rex guys.

2468
02:04:53,350 --> 02:04:54,710
The Google T-Rex.

2469
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:55,790
Okay.

2470
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:57,530
Maybe I'll head towards the light.

2471
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:07,720
Love what you've done with the place.

2472
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,940
Oh look, this table's empty.

2473
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,160
Is it for us?

2474
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:17,340
Hello, ma'am.

2475
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,420
I didn't...

2476
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:25,180
Oh my gosh, there is a female model.

2477
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:28,720
I didn't know we were having...

2478
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:31,460
a head tonight.

2479
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,760
Oh, the spaghetti also looks delicious.

2480
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:34,340
Lovely.

2481
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:37,820
This guy has got his Joker costume on.

2482
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:40,520
Hello.

2483
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:42,920
Maybe I can sneak past her.

2484
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:49,620
Nope, I'm stuck.

2485
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:51,180
Maybe...

2486
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:51,700
Oh, this way?

2487
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:54,540
Let's go...

2488
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:55,220
this way.

2489
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:57,140
Rizgum!

2490
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:57,920
Oh my god.

2491
02:05:58,480 --> 02:05:58,820
Lucky.

2492
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:00,880
Lucky, lucky.

2493
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:04,060
You guys want a South beer?

2494
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:04,860
A North beer?

2495
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:05,780
A West beer?

2496
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:08,820
Or an East beer?

2497
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:11,260
We got it all here.

2498
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:12,800
We got the American Oak.

2499
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,400
We've got the Juniper.

2500
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:17,100
We've got...

2501
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:18,640
the Rose's Gin.

2502
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:23,360
Is that her singing?

2503
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:25,380
It's kind of a vibe.

2504
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:28,180
She's kind of awesome.

2505
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:30,580
She's my dream woman right now.

2506
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:33,420
Okay, we can't do that.

2507
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:33,700
Okay.

2508
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:36,840
I'm gonna try and maybe sneak around her.

2509
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:39,700
I couldn't go that way, so...

2510
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:41,140
maybe if I cut through here?

2511
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:42,500
No?

2512
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:42,960
Okay.

2513
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,840
Maybe if I just go really slow, she won't notice me.

2514
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,260
Oh my gosh!

2515
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
White lady!

2516
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:57,540
I didn't see you there.

2517
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:00,580
I didn't see you there.

2518
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:01,660
What?

2519
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:03,340
That's so crazy.

2520
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:04,260
What a coinkidink.

2521
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,700
I knew you would come.

2522
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:08,140
Let's go.

2523
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:09,600
I've booked us a table.

2524
02:07:11,060 --> 02:07:11,180
Oh.

2525
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,020
Awesome.

2526
02:07:13,860 --> 02:07:15,220
How did you get up here so fast?

2527
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:20,000
This one for us?

2528
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:20,320
Okay.

2529
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:24,260
You're late.

2530
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:30,520
But I forgive you.

2531
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:32,740
She likes me a lot, I think.

2532
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:56,320
I didn't go on a date with you.

2533
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:57,480
That sounds...

2534
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:59,720
She said sand, so the beach.

2535
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:00,400
Right?

2536
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:01,280
We went to the beach.

2537
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:04,180
The sea.

2538
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:05,220
The sunset.

2539
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:07,140
And just the two of us.

2540
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,040
The proposal.

2541
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:10,860
It was in the restaurant.

2542
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:12,280
Here.

2543
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:17,800
You didn't have to serve my favorite!

2544
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,920
I love a bratwurst.

2545
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:24,800
I love that.

2546
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:25,420
Thank you.

2547
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:28,540
I didn't know you.

2548
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:29,100
Wait, what?

2549
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:30,600
I proposed?

2550
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:32,240
Wait, someone proposed to you?

2551
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:34,080
But they didn't even know who you were?

2552
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:37,740
Doubts.

2553
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,520
Then you raised a glass and made a toast.

2554
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:43,200
Your words then.

2555
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:44,800
Repeat them.

2556
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:47,400
To love.

2557
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:48,280
To you.

2558
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:49,520
To trust.

2559
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:50,840
I can't drink.

2560
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:54,260
Your beauty has made my head spin more than champagne.

2561
02:08:57,700 --> 02:09:00,760
To love sounds like she would...

2562
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:02,960
Like, I don't want to just spend all my gum.

2563
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:03,980
What if we need it later?

2564
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:08,380
To love.

2565
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,540
I would like to believe that.

2566
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:20,280
You said I was the only one for you.

2567
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:22,140
I quit my job.

2568
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:23,320
For you.

2569
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:25,420
I left my loved ones.

2570
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:26,920
For you.

2571
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:27,820
Oh god.

2572
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:29,940
And you left.

2573
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:30,800
But I'm here.

2574
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:33,220
Took away my family.

2575
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:34,260
Friends.

2576
02:09:34,700 --> 02:09:35,220
Youth.

2577
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Nothing is left.

2578
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:37,400
Nothing.

2579
02:09:41,670 --> 02:09:43,350
I don't understand what you're talking about.

2580
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:43,850
Please.

2581
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:45,750
He treated you terribly.

2582
02:09:46,770 --> 02:09:48,110
But I came back.

2583
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:49,450
I will be with you.

2584
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:53,030
Do we really play into her Delulu?

2585
02:09:56,070 --> 02:09:58,210
Number two, he treated you terribly.

2586
02:09:58,430 --> 02:09:59,290
It might be good, right?

2587
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:02,330
Oh yeah.

2588
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:03,970
You...

2589
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:05,450
You're not him, right?

2590
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:06,810
Yeah, I'm different.

2591
02:10:06,990 --> 02:10:08,190
I'm not like them.

2592
02:10:10,510 --> 02:10:11,630
She doesn't...

2593
02:10:11,630 --> 02:10:12,650
It went down.

2594
02:10:14,510 --> 02:10:15,470
You should leave.

2595
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:17,150
Leave.

2596
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:18,570
Get out!

2597
02:10:19,450 --> 02:10:19,830
No.

2598
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:21,250
Don't look at me.

2599
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:22,490
Leave.

2600
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:23,050
Leave!

2601
02:10:26,850 --> 02:10:27,850
She's gone.

2602
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:29,890
Just like that.

2603
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:36,570
It's my show now.

2604
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:38,130
Why am I so tiny?

2605
02:10:41,530 --> 02:10:46,790
I would like to dedicate this one to all the lonely fellas out there.

2606
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:55,120
If it hadn't been for Cotton Eye Joe.

2607
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:59,340
I've been married a long time ago.

2608
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,980
Where did he come from?

2609
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:03,380
Where did he go?

2610
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,840
Where did he come from?

2611
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:06,960
Cotton Eye Joe.

2612
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:21,200
Thank you.

2613
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:23,820
Thank you.

2614
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:25,400
Date night is looking good for everybody.

2615
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:27,140
I can't see anything.

2616
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:29,080
I don't know if there's anything to grab here.

2617
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:31,160
I don't feel like searching the darkness.

2618
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:32,900
Alright.

2619
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:34,580
To the rooftop!

2620
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:34,860
Rooftop!

2621
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:38,660
To the toilet.

2622
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:40,740
Nevermind.

2623
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:45,720
I need to use the restroom after that encounter we had.

2624
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,720
Because I want to pee my pants.

2625
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:51,120
Well, no.

2626
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:52,020
I was going to.

2627
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:52,820
I don't want to.

2628
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,040
Wait.

2629
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:55,960
What's out here?

2630
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:57,800
Or over here, I mean.

2631
02:11:58,540 --> 02:11:59,340
Okay, nevermind.

2632
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:00,540
I don't want to go into the darkness.

2633
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:05,880
I

2634
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:16,140
was going to pee my pants, but then I said I want to go to the bathroom.

2635
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:19,160
So I just combined it!

2636
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,360
I didn't mean to say that!

2637
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:28,560
I didn't mean to say...I messed up.

2638
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:31,940
I messed it up!

2639
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:35,380
You know what I meant, I think.

2640
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:39,100
Stop sending a blues!

2641
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,580
I hear a phone ringing.

2642
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:47,660
I thought from far away it said Minty Island.

2643
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,240
Oh yeah!

2644
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:50,640
DJ Donald!

2645
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,560
Marisha!

2646
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,340
And Scott Boys!

2647
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:59,220
Party Island, Friday 24th of April!

2648
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:02,280
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

2649
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:04,840
Yeah, it's Party Island!

2650
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:09,980
Sleepy Mint sure says some special things.

2651
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:12,840
I'm picking up...

2652
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:15,060
The government lies.

2653
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:16,800
They are already here.

2654
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:17,820
Mind control.

2655
02:13:18,180 --> 02:13:18,860
Do you hear voices?

2656
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:20,820
They are not hallucinations.

2657
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:22,280
Experiments on humans.

2658
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:24,220
Mutagens in the water.

2659
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,120
Super slaves and super soldiers.

2660
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:31,300
Find out the truth.

2661
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,320
Oh, the little...

2662
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:36,460
He even decorated the backside.

2663
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:38,800
That's so exciting.

2664
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:39,720
Is this guy like...

2665
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:40,480
Did he do all of...

2666
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:40,900
Oh wait!

2667
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:43,840
Didn't we...

2668
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:46,740
We went to a room that had the map and everything.

2669
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,820
So he is part of the government lies.

2670
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:54,300
Alright, let's go to the...

2671
02:13:56,740 --> 02:13:58,540
This is crazy that we are outside.

2672
02:13:58,640 --> 02:13:59,920
There are so many birds!

2673
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:03,640
Why are there so many birds?

2674
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:04,440
Where are they going?

2675
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:07,260
Is it up here?

2676
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:10,700
Oh yeah.

2677
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:11,440
Wait, hold on.

2678
02:14:13,060 --> 02:14:15,020
Before that, is there anything over here?

2679
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,860
Doesn't seem to be the case.

2680
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,300
Oh, I can see downstairs!

2681
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:22,820
Wait, that's so awesome!

2682
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:26,320
It's pretty bad looking.

2683
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:27,920
I'm not gonna lie.

2684
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:30,860
Who are the patriots?

2685
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:34,000
Can you jump?

2686
02:14:34,180 --> 02:14:35,220
You cannot jump.

2687
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,540
City looks pretty rough, yeah.

2688
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:43,340
City looks pretty rough.

2689
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,920
This has been pretty solid for an indie horror game, you know.

2690
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:52,940
Indie horror games are always hit and miss.

2691
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:56,220
Thanks to you and Doki, I went to Costco and bought some stuff.

2692
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:56,680
Boom!

2693
02:14:57,440 --> 02:15:02,840
Then I bought dinner because I was waiting for a car fix until I saw a double chunk chocolate chip cookie.

2694
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:05,300
Brain rot.

2695
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:12,240
Hey, you took so long to answer that I thought you were done for.

2696
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,500
Oh, I met the white lady.

2697
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:18,520
It's amazing that you managed to get here at all.

2698
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:23,440
I saw on the cameras what she does to people she meets and it's an unpleasant sight.

2699
02:15:25,180 --> 02:15:27,940
It seems that you have your own personal guardian angel.

2700
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:33,580
To send a distress signal, you need to adjust to turn and turn on this old antenna.

2701
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:36,600
Zaib, thank you so much for the 10 gift.

2702
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:41,960
It looks complicated but it's simple.

2703
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:43,180
Just listen to me carefully.

2704
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,860
There should be a panel with switches to your right.

2705
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:48,440
This thing regulates the voltage of the antenna.

2706
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:52,620
Set it so that it shows 10...

2707
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:53,960
Oh, volts.

2708
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:55,680
10 volts.

2709
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:56,480
That should be enough.

2710
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:59,580
Oh, we're still on the phone.

2711
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:02,960
So it needs to be 10?

2712
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:05,340
And is that 12?

2713
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:10,900
There we go.

2714
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:12,160
Math.

2715
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,180
Great.

2716
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:16,400
I started hearing interference on the radio.

2717
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,460
Which means the signal went out.

2718
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:20,880
We need to set the transmission frequency.

2719
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:25,320
To the left, there should be a panel with a green screen.

2720
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,560
And next to it is a mini antenna for receiving short frequencies.

2721
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:34,060
Turn it so that the signal on the panel matches the amplitude we need.

2722
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:35,520
Okay.

2723
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,400
Turn the antenna.

2724
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:38,100
Oh, okay.

2725
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:39,220
Rotate right.

2726
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:41,500
Rotate right again.

2727
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,740
Rotate right again.

2728
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,080
Oh, it's getting bigger.

2729
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:45,540
Never mind.

2730
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:46,260
Rotate left.

2731
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:48,040
Rotate left.

2732
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:50,300
Rotate right.

2733
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:52,080
Rotate right.

2734
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:53,260
Easy.

2735
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:55,860
Well done, kid.

2736
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:57,500
The signal has become clearer.

2737
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,680
Now let's launch the large antenna at full power.

2738
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:05,760
In the center, slightly to the right of the phone, there should be a lever.

2739
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:06,600
Oh, I see it.

2740
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:07,900
Pull it and everything will work.

2741
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:09,600
Pull the lever.

2742
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:21,780
I don't think that's how that works, but neat.

2743
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:23,900
It worked!

2744
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:25,400
You did a great job, kid!

2745
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:29,120
When will the answer come?

2746
02:17:29,220 --> 02:17:30,160
How is he supposed to know that?

2747
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:31,260
Do I need to do anything else?

2748
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:32,160
No, kid.

2749
02:17:32,180 --> 02:17:33,020
You did a great job.

2750
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:36,980
As soon as I can reconfigure the antenna to transmit the signal, the rescuers will come.

2751
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:38,600
But it's a long process.

2752
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:40,520
You will have to wait a couple of days.

2753
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:43,720
All that on only 10 volts?

2754
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:46,940
Don't worry about it.

2755
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:50,640
Maybe it says 10, but it means like 10 million.

2756
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:53,400
Drops into the pit.

2757
02:17:53,740 --> 02:17:54,880
Wrong lever!

2758
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:58,640
Go down to your place and wait for my call.

2759
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:01,120
As soon as I can... Oh my god.

2760
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:04,300
So sorry guys, I can't stop yawning.

2761
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:06,420
As soon as I can send a signal, I'll let you know.

2762
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:08,220
Just be careful.

2763
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:10,820
A few minutes ago I noticed movement on your floor.

2764
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:17,920
Oh, wait, where am I?

2765
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:21,420
Am I at my floor?

2766
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:27,880
What's going on?

2767
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:30,020
Gosh, that scared me.

2768
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:31,940
The lady!

2769
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:35,880
That's so freaky!

2770
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:36,800
Oh my god!

2771
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:40,720
Oh, there's a raid?

2772
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,800
Thank you for the raid!

2773
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:43,220
Hello, hello!

2774
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:46,860
It's a bit of a spooky game.

2775
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:49,200
Oh...

2776
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:52,240
Oh my god.

2777
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:54,380
This way.

2778
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:56,460
Wait, I'm possessed though.

2779
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,800
I don't know, I didn't see who raided me, but thank you!

2780
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:00,780
Raymac, thanks for the 5 gifted!

2781
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,180
Am I going back to my room when I'm possessed?

2782
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:05,200
Is that a good idea?

2783
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:07,840
Murphy, thanks for the 5 gifted!

2784
02:19:08,260 --> 02:19:12,200
Gosh, the stuff loading in really freaks me out sometimes.

2785
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:13,920
See, like that.

2786
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:16,380
Hey, you okay in there?

2787
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:19,420
Guess we can't knock.

2788
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:20,940
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

2789
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:23,320
Oh my god!

2790
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:26,160
I was waiting for you.

2791
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:28,920
Oh my gosh, priest, you scared me!

2792
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:30,960
Let's go.

2793
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,480
I want to talk to you.

2794
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:35,520
To my room.

2795
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,200
I said, come with me.

2796
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:41,520
Yes sir.

2797
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:42,600
Yes?

2798
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:43,440
In here?

2799
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:46,460
Wait, were you the guy in here the whole time?

2800
02:19:48,220 --> 02:19:49,440
I'm so small.

2801
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:52,800
I'm like, hey mister, were you the guy in here?

2802
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:55,120
Were you the man that I helped out earlier?

2803
02:19:57,260 --> 02:19:59,720
Okay, I'm in here.

2804
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:01,800
I'm in here.

2805
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:03,840
Wait, he didn't kill the guy in here, right?

2806
02:20:05,460 --> 02:20:06,000
Where is he?

2807
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:08,520
I want to apologize for our previous meeting.

2808
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,600
I've done you wrong.

2809
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:14,860
I succumbed to empty suspicions and would like to ask for your forgiveness.

2810
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:17,140
Oh, maybe he's not a bad guy.

2811
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:19,420
Do you accept my apologies?

2812
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:24,000
Where is the room owner?

2813
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:28,980
Don't get distracted by trifles.

2814
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:30,620
Focus on our conversation.

2815
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:35,740
I have prepared something for you.

2816
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:37,240
A gift.

2817
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:39,240
Okay, I like that.

2818
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:40,760
And a lesson.

2819
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:42,420
Oh, I have to learn?

2820
02:20:43,060 --> 02:20:45,260
I always apologize with gun in hand.

2821
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:45,740
True.

2822
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:50,080
No!

2823
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:51,420
He's in the closet!

2824
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:55,980
Not like that, but...

2825
02:20:55,980 --> 02:20:56,980
Beep beep!

2826
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,200
6 out of 10 gifted!

2827
02:20:59,140 --> 02:20:59,940
What's happening?

2828
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:02,340
A confession.

2829
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:06,320
I learned a lot from our last meeting.

2830
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:08,480
Hard days have come.

2831
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,120
The end of times.

2832
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:12,600
I will teach you how to get through it.

2833
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,920
The man living in this room is sinful.

2834
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:17,540
He confessed it himself.

2835
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:22,640
This sin eats him from the inside, turns him into a spawn of hell.

2836
02:21:24,140 --> 02:21:26,280
Accept his confession and I will pass judgment.

2837
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:27,820
You have time.

2838
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:28,460
Wait, what?

2839
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:30,720
Not too much time.

2840
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:34,300
Are you alive?

2841
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,340
Please don't do that!

2842
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:37,920
Wait, young man, is that you?

2843
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:40,020
He burst in here with a gun.

2844
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:41,620
He said I was infected and threatened to kill me.

2845
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:42,300
Oh my god, the timer.

2846
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:43,500
I'm healthy.

2847
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:44,820
Please convince him to leave.

2848
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:49,440
Are you experiencing any strange symptoms?

2849
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:50,220
Symptoms?

2850
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:51,480
My nosebleed won't stop.

2851
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:53,060
And I can't sleep because of nightmares.

2852
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:55,360
But that doesn't mean anything.

2853
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:57,940
Why are you bleeding?

2854
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:00,920
He gives us time.

2855
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,020
I have a high blood pressure.

2856
02:22:02,140 --> 02:22:03,240
It happens when I'm nervous.

2857
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:06,220
I don't want to ask about the nightmares.

2858
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,260
It might incriminate him.

2859
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:08,940
Do you have any proof that you're sick?

2860
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:11,320
You helped me with the medicines.

2861
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,660
There should be an empty bottle somewhere in the room.

2862
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:15,900
Also, my pressure gauge is somewhere here.

2863
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:18,800
Okay, talk about something else.

2864
02:22:19,860 --> 02:22:21,180
We'll attack him.

2865
02:22:23,380 --> 02:22:24,600
Tell me what happened.

2866
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:26,800
The medicine you found has run out.

2867
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:31,000
I went to find a first aid kit but ran into this madman in the corridor.

2868
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:34,760
He shoved me into the closet so I couldn't run away and interrogated me.

2869
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,240
Everything will be fine.

2870
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:38,640
Don't waste your time.

2871
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:40,860
I'll be back soon.

2872
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:43,640
Wait, something about his sin, right?

2873
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:45,700
Okay, so look under the bed.

2874
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:49,940
Take the medicine.

2875
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:52,780
Label says it helps cope with high blood pressure.

2876
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:53,740
I'm coping?

2877
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:54,380
I'm coping?

2878
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:55,900
Okay, nice.

2879
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:58,140
And then he said...

2880
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:00,980
He said his pressure thing, right?

2881
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:02,940
Oh, open?

2882
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:05,020
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2883
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:06,180
Pressure gauge.

2884
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:08,140
A device for measuring pressure.

2885
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:13,140
It will help prove that this poor guy is sick but not infected.

2886
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:15,780
Okay, are you alive?

2887
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:17,540
I found an empty medicine bottle.

2888
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:19,480
This is my blood pressure medicine.

2889
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:22,920
It will confirm that my bleeding is indeed due to illness.

2890
02:23:23,380 --> 02:23:24,860
He said something about your sin?

2891
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:29,000
I feel guilty, yes, towards my son, but I don't want to talk about it.

2892
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:30,980
Interesting, okay.

2893
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:32,500
And it shouldn't matter.

2894
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:34,980
He's not telling the whole truth about his son.

2895
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:36,220
I need to search the room.

2896
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:38,240
Okay, I'll be back.

2897
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:39,480
I don't think we should attack him.

2898
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:42,680
I don't think we should attack that guy.

2899
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:43,520
Anything in here?

2900
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:45,700
Your son in here?

2901
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:50,440
Faded photograph.

2902
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:53,560
Photograph of a mother and child, but there's no father in them.

2903
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:55,200
I mean, there might be.

2904
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:56,320
The dog!

2905
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:00,140
Reminds me of my childhood photos.

2906
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:02,980
It seems the neighbor did not participate in the family life.

2907
02:24:03,980 --> 02:24:06,660
I mean, there is a father.

2908
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:07,980
He's just crossed out.

2909
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:09,720
But also the dog!

2910
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:10,840
So funny.

2911
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:13,840
Okay, I think we can talk to him now.

2912
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:15,120
Speak.

2913
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:21,380
I can prove that he doesn't deserve to die.

2914
02:24:22,460 --> 02:24:23,020
Are you sure?

2915
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:25,440
If not, it will only make things worse.

2916
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:26,680
Yes.

2917
02:24:28,180 --> 02:24:29,480
The time has come.

2918
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:31,040
It's time to pass judgment.

2919
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:32,780
What do you think?

2920
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:35,480
Does he bear the devil's mark?

2921
02:24:39,350 --> 02:24:40,070
Did my stream go down?

2922
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:45,700
Oh, did YouTube...

2923
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:46,720
Did YouTube...

2924
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:47,140
Oh, we're back?

2925
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:47,700
Sorry.

2926
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:49,340
I think something happened with YouTube.

2927
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:50,060
A little hiccup.

2928
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:57,520
After this, I'm gonna get more water.

2929
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:03,520
He's not infected.

2930
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:09,780
He's sick with something.

2931
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:10,940
It could be anything.

2932
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:14,160
We're just making it worse.

2933
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,060
It could be anything.

2934
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:16,920
I don't know.

2935
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:18,080
You think so?

2936
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:18,680
Then tell me.

2937
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:20,020
Why is he bleeding?

2938
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:22,940
He has high blood pressure.

2939
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:24,000
Pressure.

2940
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:25,600
It causes nosebleed.

2941
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:27,580
Do you have proof?

2942
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:29,400
Or do you just want to believe it?

2943
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:33,740
I found his blood pressure medicine.

2944
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:36,700
Alright, let's say I believe you.

2945
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:40,040
He said he is tormented by nightmares.

2946
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:42,720
You heard the radio messages, my son.

2947
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:44,240
You know what this means.

2948
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:48,000
He's worried about his family.

2949
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:49,340
His dreams are only about them.

2950
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:50,900
Oh, maybe I should have asked about the nightmares.

2951
02:25:52,460 --> 02:25:54,480
No one spoke to him in his dreams.

2952
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:56,300
Look at what's happening around us.

2953
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:57,180
He's just scared.

2954
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:58,420
Do you believe the radio?

2955
02:25:58,600 --> 02:25:59,300
Should we trust it?

2956
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:00,960
The devil sends him nightmares.

2957
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:05,840
No, we know he's worried about his family.

2958
02:26:06,260 --> 02:26:06,800
His son.

2959
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,980
What difference does it make who he dreams of?

2960
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:12,750
Nightmares have already captured him.

2961
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,380
One way or another, he admitted the guilt himself.

2962
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:18,520
Although he didn't say what he's guilty of.

2963
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,560
Did you find that out?

2964
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:22,160
People will say anything at gunpoint.

2965
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:25,700
When he was young, he abandoned his family and his little son.

2966
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:29,620
The Bible says, judge not that ye...

2967
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:32,540
Wait, judge not that ye be not judged.

2968
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:34,140
I don't know.

2969
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:37,180
Did he abandon his family?

2970
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:41,760
I thought he said like he gave a lot of money to his son.

2971
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:46,460
Right?

2972
02:26:52,060 --> 02:26:53,040
The picture.

2973
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:55,000
Oh, it did say that.

2974
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,560
Oh, yeah, I guess like...

2975
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:58,540
Don't pick three.

2976
02:26:59,100 --> 02:26:59,640
This one?

2977
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:00,740
Is that bad?

2978
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:04,700
What does that mean?

2979
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:07,180
Judge not that ye be not judged.

2980
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:08,980
Is it double negative?

2981
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:10,720
I don't understand it.

2982
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:17,500
Don't judge people.

2983
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:19,460
Oh, three is preachy.

2984
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:21,120
Oh, he's a preacher.

2985
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:22,300
Oh, he's a priest.

2986
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:24,680
I'll try two.

2987
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:26,620
Betrayal is the worst of sins.

2988
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:27,900
What do you think he deserves?

2989
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:29,600
Oh, betrayal.

2990
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:32,320
Is that really the worst of sins?

2991
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:34,740
Maybe murder is what...

2992
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:37,640
I think murder might be up there too, Mr. Priest.

2993
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:41,460
The choice has been made and the sentence has been passed, my son.

2994
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:46,140
Still absolutely shooket by how amazing your 3.0 looks.

2995
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:47,400
Thank you!

2996
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:50,540
Yeah, I love it so much too.

2997
02:27:50,700 --> 02:27:52,040
I'm glad you like it.

2998
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:55,800
Oh, innocent!

2999
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,160
You convinced the priest to spare your neighbor.

3000
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:01,040
I forgive those sins that torment him.

3001
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:02,340
You're welcome.

3002
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,380
For what?

3003
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:06,060
For this lesson.

3004
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:11,140
Do not trust even those who seem innocent.

3005
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:14,580
In the world of sin, only sinners are found.

3006
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:15,860
Now go.

3007
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:19,700
Until we meet again.

3008
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:23,780
You're going to let him out though, right?

3009
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:24,800
Are you alive?

3010
02:28:25,660 --> 02:28:26,520
Is he letting me go?

3011
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:27,680
Thank god!

3012
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:28,780
Thank you!

3013
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:31,320
I won't come out of here until he leaves.

3014
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:32,020
See you later.

3015
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:33,860
You can't come out of here.

3016
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:35,580
He literally...

3017
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:36,700
Wait, wait, wait.

3018
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:39,040
Downtown bombing.

3019
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:39,900
Oh my god.

3020
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:41,660
But you can't get out.

3021
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:43,900
He put the chair...

3022
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:47,040
You're going to move the chair though, right?

3023
02:28:47,580 --> 02:28:49,180
You're going to move the chair, Mr. Priest?

3024
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:50,940
Oh my god, we almost saw his face for a second.

3025
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:54,400
Don't tilt your head at me like that.

3026
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:58,880
OK, I'm getting out of here.

3027
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:10,500
OK.

3028
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:12,360
Let's just go home.

3029
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:14,260
Let's just go home.

3030
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:19,140
Oh my god.

3031
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:22,400
Why does it sound like that?

3032
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:24,060
Oh my god, it was so...

3033
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:26,680
I thought I was going to hear a gunshot after.

3034
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:29,500
Hello, I'm home!

3035
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:35,160
God, you scared me!

3036
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:38,960
I did!

3037
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:40,060
I fixed the antenna!

3038
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:48,800
I met a priest.

3039
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:49,840
He threatened our neighbor.

3040
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:51,380
It's already over.

3041
02:29:51,460 --> 02:29:52,060
Don't worry.

3042
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:53,700
Should I be honest?

3043
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:54,580
I met a priest.

3044
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:55,440
Did he threaten the neighbor?

3045
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:57,400
Yeah.

3046
02:30:01,140 --> 02:30:03,360
OK, she definitely came from that cult.

3047
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:06,200
She definitely came from that cult.

3048
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:08,460
She also needs to know that the priest is dangerous, right?

3049
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:11,680
Are you sure?

3050
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:20,800
OK.

3051
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,860
I'm just going to take a little nap.

3052
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:26,560
Hopefully I don't go to the ocean.

3053
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:28,220
You know?

3054
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:30,580
Just a nap in the inn.

3055
02:30:30,580 --> 02:30:32,780
The nap in my hotel room.

3056
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:34,300
The nap...

3057
02:30:39,460 --> 02:30:42,420
Why am I in the bathroom again?

3058
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:51,420
Is this happening?

3059
02:30:52,480 --> 02:30:53,700
Is this real?

3060
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:55,560
Do I need to censor?

3061
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:56,280
Wait.

3062
02:31:00,060 --> 02:31:01,340
Isn't it dangerous there?

3063
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:03,380
There is where?

3064
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:04,520
Where are we going?

3065
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:05,540
Trust me.

3066
02:31:10,830 --> 02:31:11,530
We're leaving?

3067
02:31:11,730 --> 02:31:12,710
This has to be a dream.

3068
02:31:13,350 --> 02:31:13,850
Oh my god.

3069
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:15,350
She just left so casually.

3070
02:31:15,970 --> 02:31:17,130
There is no way this is real.

3071
02:31:17,990 --> 02:31:19,470
I don't see any water.

3072
02:31:21,190 --> 02:31:22,870
And the moon is back to normal actually.

3073
02:31:23,230 --> 02:31:24,390
No, there is no way this is real.

3074
02:31:28,110 --> 02:31:28,830
Skinny dipping?

3075
02:31:29,710 --> 02:31:30,630
Don't, don't.

3076
02:31:30,910 --> 02:31:31,550
Wait, what is she doing?

3077
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,980
Oh my god, we are vandalizing the place.

3078
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:40,620
Let's go!

3079
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:44,360
It doesn't look great.

3080
02:31:44,380 --> 02:31:44,980
It looks cute.

3081
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:45,780
It doesn't look great.

3082
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:46,840
Why did you do this?

3083
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:49,160
You are drawing attention towards us.

3084
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:51,960
No, it looks cute.

3085
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:55,220
It's a little lopsided.

3086
02:31:55,220 --> 02:31:57,880
I don't think you tried hard enough, Robin.

3087
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,560
Oh, hell yeah.

3088
02:32:02,800 --> 02:32:04,360
Okay, pick up a spray paint.

3089
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:05,920
Cold to the touch.

3090
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:07,240
It was used often.

3091
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:09,920
Dang, she's... Oh my god, she's a bad girl.

3092
02:32:11,740 --> 02:32:12,660
We're drawing?

3093
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:13,740
Oh, okay.

3094
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:17,280
What should I draw?

3095
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:18,940
Whatever you want.

3096
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:21,140
Let's make this place more lively.

3097
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:23,520
Just think of something and write it.

3098
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:27,060
Oh yeah, I was really getting sick of the blood decor, you know.

3099
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:30,460
She's a baddie for real.

3100
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:32,880
Or just draw without thinking.

3101
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:34,400
Let's see what happens.

3102
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:36,560
I wonder if it will let me draw whatever I want.

3103
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:38,540
Draw without thinking.

3104
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:41,560
Write hopeless.

3105
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:45,400
Write what happens now.

3106
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:47,400
Write stay alive.

3107
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:49,720
Close your eyes and draw without thinking.

3108
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:50,080
You know what?

3109
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:52,220
I wanna see what comes out of my brain.

3110
02:32:52,900 --> 02:32:56,540
Oh my gosh, it's probably gonna be like a peepee, but...

3111
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:01,420
Okay,

3112
02:33:16,660 --> 02:33:17,920
now it's my turn.

3113
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:19,400
What are you gonna draw?

3114
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:26,680
Looks like the type of woman that would make you worse mentally.

3115
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:29,100
Maybe.

3116
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:33,480
I love her little hair ribbons, they're so cute.

3117
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:38,660
No tongue?

3118
02:33:42,260 --> 02:33:44,040
She hates the French.

3119
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:46,700
No tongue, I don't understand what it means.

3120
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:48,360
You can't speak frankly?

3121
02:33:48,540 --> 02:33:49,660
We should stay quiet?

3122
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:51,960
I don't understand what this means.

3123
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:57,760
She is so weird.

3124
02:34:07,910 --> 02:34:09,510
Robin, are you okay?

3125
02:34:10,210 --> 02:34:13,370
This is really, all of this is really getting to her head, I think.

3126
02:34:22,430 --> 02:34:24,370
What does that have to do with tongue?

3127
02:34:31,230 --> 02:34:33,350
I'm riding, I hate my past.

3128
02:34:33,830 --> 02:34:35,450
Oh gosh, what are we gonna write now?

3129
02:34:36,130 --> 02:34:38,710
Remember the foster care and write alone.

3130
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:40,610
She's just a little freaky.

3131
02:34:42,990 --> 02:34:44,330
No tongue kissing?

3132
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:45,750
She's tired of tongues.

3133
02:34:46,650 --> 02:34:49,590
Gyutan, remember your mother and write rip.

3134
02:34:51,130 --> 02:34:53,170
Remember why I came to the hotel.

3135
02:34:55,290 --> 02:34:57,590
She's not a cunning linguist.

3136
02:35:00,410 --> 02:35:01,750
She hates tongue.

3137
02:35:05,530 --> 02:35:07,870
Draw without thinking, should I draw without thinking again?

3138
02:35:08,530 --> 02:35:12,890
Am I gonna write more eldritch horror stuff?

3139
02:35:13,250 --> 02:35:15,510
Oh gosh, I don't know.

3140
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:19,950
Rip, no tongue, maybe I should say rip because it's just like...

3141
02:35:19,950 --> 02:35:21,950
Oh, no tongue, rip.

3142
02:35:22,390 --> 02:35:23,190
Four again?

3143
02:35:23,470 --> 02:35:24,490
You guys want four again?

3144
02:35:24,590 --> 02:35:25,110
Three or four?

3145
02:35:26,270 --> 02:35:26,970
Three maybe.

3146
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:28,470
Oh, but why I came to the hotel.

3147
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:31,550
Yeah, we still don't really exactly know why I'm here.

3148
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:35,130
It still hasn't really been explained yet.

3149
02:35:35,550 --> 02:35:36,390
Okay, let's try three.

3150
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:40,710
No future.

3151
02:35:40,970 --> 02:35:43,110
No future, no tongue.

3152
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:49,140
Why I came to the hotel.

3153
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:55,940
Yeah.

3154
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:06,060
So true.

3155
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:08,000
Robin is such an optimist, I love her.

3156
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:12,620
She's definitely not very gothy.

3157
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:16,840
Nice handwriting though.

3158
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:19,660
I know, we have like the perfect graffiti handwriting.

3159
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:22,180
What do you want to ask me, Robin?

3160
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:33,040
What do you mean by... I thought she was gonna confess her love to me.

3161
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:36,560
Wait, what do you mean by that?

3162
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:44,800
Oh my gosh, we really are in the video game.

3163
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:48,620
Wait, she knows that I'm...

3164
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:50,000
Oh my god.

3165
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:51,620
Oh wait, I have...

3166
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:58,480
I can't distinguish faces and intonations.

3167
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:02,720
I can't distinguish faces and intonations except your voice.

3168
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:04,380
I just like to think a lot.

3169
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:06,580
Oh, the fourth wall shattered.

3170
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:07,840
Oh my god.

3171
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:10,000
That's why we can't see the faces.

3172
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:11,020
I have...

3173
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:14,360
Oh, agnosia.

3174
02:37:16,420 --> 02:37:18,180
Number two, to risk her up.

3175
02:37:18,280 --> 02:37:19,280
Oh yeah, let's do that.

3176
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:23,540
Yeah.

3177
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,920
Yeah, exactly.

3178
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:39,080
Oh, you're giving up to me?

3179
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:41,780
Alien.

3180
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:46,400
I want to see what her alien looks like.

3181
02:37:51,670 --> 02:37:53,110
Okay, do it.

3182
02:37:53,350 --> 02:37:53,910
Oh, here we go.

3183
02:37:54,650 --> 02:37:55,110
Let's go.

3184
02:37:55,410 --> 02:37:56,190
Let's see the alien.

3185
02:37:56,190 --> 02:37:56,370
Alien?

3186
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:17,110
Appreciated, but not accepted.

3187
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:21,010
Yeah, I think so too.

3188
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:24,290
Bold and brash.

3189
02:38:24,730 --> 02:38:26,870
It really does look like that Squidward picture.

3190
02:38:32,730 --> 02:38:34,490
Aww, I did have fun.

3191
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:41,310
Okay guys, I'm gonna go grab more water real quick and I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

3192
02:38:42,490 --> 02:38:45,610
So I will be back in like just a few...

3193
02:38:46,830 --> 02:38:47,890
In like just a minute.

3194
02:38:51,450 --> 02:38:54,270
Maybe I should get coffee instead of water.

3195
02:38:55,430 --> 02:38:56,850
I'm gonna grab something with caffeine.

3196
02:38:57,590 --> 02:39:00,070
I'm gonna grab something with caffeine instead.

3197
02:39:00,670 --> 02:39:01,850
Go pee your pants, girl.

3198
02:39:02,190 --> 02:39:03,610
I'm gonna go pee my pants!

3199
02:39:04,130 --> 02:39:06,090
I'm gonna go pee my pants!

3200
02:39:06,570 --> 02:39:07,610
Okay, I'll be right back.

3201
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:43,560
I'm back.

3202
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:44,640
Sorry about that.

3203
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:48,760
I said hello to my kitties as well.

3204
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:53,020
My paws, my girl cat.

3205
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:58,260
She's been slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly warming up to me.

3206
02:44:00,500 --> 02:44:04,340
But recently more, she's been sleeping at my feet.

3207
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:06,100
So I'm happy about that.

3208
02:44:06,420 --> 02:44:09,000
And I went to go check on her and she was in my bed.

3209
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:10,360
So I was happy about that.

3210
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:11,960
Which she does not lay in my bed often.

3211
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:14,960
So I was like, yay!

3212
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:18,100
And she'll like sleep at my feet.

3213
02:44:18,460 --> 02:44:20,500
Which I hate, typically.

3214
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:22,140
Oh my gosh, I hate a lot.

3215
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:24,700
I hate when cats sleep at my feet.

3216
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:27,800
And Butaro, he sleeps by my head.

3217
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:30,540
So it's so much nicer.

3218
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:31,940
But she'll sleep at my feet.

3219
02:44:32,260 --> 02:44:35,080
But he'll, he's gotten like a little...

3220
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:35,820
How do I say?

3221
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:41,260
He's become a little bit...

3222
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:44,560
I don't think it's greedy is the right word.

3223
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:50,320
But he'll like go up to her and demand to be licked.

3224
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:53,360
And then if she doesn't lick him...

3225
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:56,880
Well, she'll lick him and then he'll like attack her.

3226
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:59,800
And then they'll start fighting at my feet.

3227
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:05,300
And I'm like, can you not do that?

3228
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:09,220
Can you not fight at my feet, please?

3229
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:13,260
No tongue in Russian is the beginning of some...

3230
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:14,320
Oh, I missed it.

3231
02:45:14,420 --> 02:45:14,600
No!

3232
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:17,120
Wait, so it has meaning?

3233
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:24,140
I feel like this game is not first language English.

3234
02:45:24,140 --> 02:45:28,140
Just from some of the ways they talk a little bit, but...

3235
02:45:34,930 --> 02:45:35,390
But...

3236
02:45:35,990 --> 02:45:37,770
It was definitely originally Russian.

3237
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:39,390
Oh, I see.

3238
02:45:39,490 --> 02:45:40,350
It's a Russian team.

3239
02:45:42,950 --> 02:45:44,410
I see, I see, I see.

3240
02:45:47,030 --> 02:45:47,950
Yeah, so...

3241
02:45:48,550 --> 02:45:49,370
Wait, hold on.

3242
02:45:49,550 --> 02:45:51,050
Let me read what that said.

3243
02:45:52,530 --> 02:45:55,570
Translates to there is no tongue or language where their voice isn't heard.

3244
02:45:58,790 --> 02:46:00,190
Matara is a translator.

3245
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:03,570
Oh my gosh, I'm seeing her next week.

3246
02:46:06,090 --> 02:46:08,330
Unfortunately, she's like staying at my house.

3247
02:46:11,050 --> 02:46:13,330
Alright, let's continue.

3248
02:46:16,510 --> 02:46:18,250
Alright, we're just walking back.

3249
02:46:18,370 --> 02:46:19,090
No tongue, baby.

3250
02:46:19,730 --> 02:46:20,710
No tongue, no future.

3251
02:46:22,210 --> 02:46:23,130
A heart.

3252
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:27,710
Alright, back to sleep.

3253
02:46:28,850 --> 02:46:30,070
Alright, good night.

3254
02:46:31,150 --> 02:46:32,250
Naino, happy birthday!

3255
02:46:33,370 --> 02:46:37,310
This helped me a lot in this era of asking for a PS3 with MGS4.

3256
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:39,850
And pen lights for the upcoming concert.

3257
02:46:40,230 --> 02:46:41,290
Oh my gosh!

3258
02:46:41,670 --> 02:46:42,350
Happy birthday!

3259
02:46:43,810 --> 02:46:45,670
Wait, it won't let me shut the door.

3260
02:46:47,050 --> 02:46:48,150
Okay, hold on.

3261
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:50,850
She's waiting for me.

3262
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:54,930
Happy birthday to you.

3263
02:46:55,450 --> 02:46:57,830
Happy birthday to you.

3264
02:46:58,210 --> 02:47:01,030
Happy birthday, dear Naino.

3265
02:47:02,210 --> 02:47:05,750
Happy birthday to you.

3266
02:47:07,930 --> 02:47:09,030
Happy birthday!

3267
02:47:10,350 --> 02:47:11,830
Okay, good night.

3268
02:47:12,890 --> 02:47:13,930
Thanks for going with me.

3269
02:47:15,630 --> 02:47:16,830
Of course.

3270
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:19,230
I thought this would help you relax.

3271
02:47:19,230 --> 02:47:22,090
But it looks like it was important for me too.

3272
02:47:24,310 --> 02:47:26,010
You feel better now?

3273
02:47:26,530 --> 02:47:28,150
Okay, it's getting late.

3274
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:29,630
Let's take a rest.

3275
02:47:29,930 --> 02:47:30,210
Yeah.

3276
02:47:30,590 --> 02:47:33,270
I have a feeling that the next few days will not be easy.

3277
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:40,370
I mean, I hope a little bit.

3278
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:50,060
I'm in confessional?

3279
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:54,700
Forgive me father for I have sinned.

3280
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:56,140
I know about it my son.

3281
02:47:56,600 --> 02:47:57,840
Tell me what happened.

3282
02:47:59,340 --> 02:48:00,820
It's been a long day.

3283
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:02,340
A lot has happened.

3284
02:48:04,260 --> 02:48:07,040
I just tortured out how to super...

3285
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:10,120
Yeah, thank you.

3286
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:16,100
Let's talk about the meeting at the restaurant first.

3287
02:48:16,360 --> 02:48:17,340
About that woman.

3288
02:48:18,320 --> 02:48:20,240
You could have pretended to be her husband.

3289
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:22,340
But you decided to ruin everything.

3290
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:23,600
No!

3291
02:48:24,040 --> 02:48:27,220
You destroyed her beautiful dream because of your own needs.

3292
02:48:28,100 --> 02:48:28,860
Was it worth it?

3293
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:31,960
She had to know the truth.

3294
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:34,240
She was calmer when she had her fantasies.

3295
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:35,520
What are you talking about?

3296
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:36,400
She became a monster.

3297
02:48:37,100 --> 02:48:40,580
Are you the one controlling her?

3298
02:48:48,450 --> 02:48:50,450
You destroyed her beautiful dream.

3299
02:48:53,130 --> 02:48:55,990
Do I be suspicious of them right away?

3300
02:48:59,910 --> 02:49:02,570
I'm torn between 1 and 4.

3301
02:49:17,150 --> 02:49:19,110
One for sure?

3302
02:49:21,790 --> 02:49:22,410
Wait, hold on.

3303
02:49:22,450 --> 02:49:22,670
I'm sorry.

3304
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:23,730
I missed the super chat.

3305
02:49:24,110 --> 02:49:24,850
Forgive me father.

3306
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:26,350
I have sinned by giving money to Minto.

3307
02:49:30,110 --> 02:49:30,890
Thank you Drezik.

3308
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:33,330
You have been forgiven of all your sins.

3309
02:49:34,090 --> 02:49:34,810
Too early for 4?

3310
02:49:34,910 --> 02:49:35,670
Okay, we'll go with 1.

3311
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:37,430
She had to know the truth.

3312
02:49:38,030 --> 02:49:40,650
Truth is a sad dream that always ends in death.

3313
02:49:41,170 --> 02:49:43,010
You'll understand this only when it's too late.

3314
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:44,890
Did we save that woman then?

3315
02:49:45,470 --> 02:49:45,830
Somehow.

3316
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:49,770
The man next door, you participated in his interrogation.

3317
02:49:50,130 --> 02:49:52,430
You convinced the priest to leave him alive.

3318
02:49:53,150 --> 02:49:55,030
A commendable but empty aspiration.

3319
02:49:55,750 --> 02:49:59,150
This man will continue to use you, but won't help you in any way.

3320
02:50:00,650 --> 02:50:03,250
Why did the priest want to kill him?

3321
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:04,470
How do you know?

3322
02:50:04,670 --> 02:50:06,070
Did you order him to do this?

3323
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:08,190
What's happening with the priest?

3324
02:50:10,390 --> 02:50:12,330
I don't like any of these options.

3325
02:50:16,230 --> 02:50:17,890
Yeah, the guy gave us food.

3326
02:50:18,010 --> 02:50:18,670
That's so true.

3327
02:50:19,490 --> 02:50:20,850
Yeah, what's happening with the priest?

3328
02:50:21,490 --> 02:50:23,930
He hurts someone who can be trusted without doubts.

3329
02:50:24,430 --> 02:50:25,130
His lord.

3330
02:50:26,170 --> 02:50:28,230
He's happy in his zeal.

3331
02:50:29,470 --> 02:50:30,530
That's not all.

3332
02:50:31,730 --> 02:50:33,970
You've let this girl manipulate you again.

3333
02:50:34,310 --> 02:50:34,950
It's a pity.

3334
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:37,270
She woke you up in the middle of the night.

3335
02:50:37,670 --> 02:50:39,570
Put you at risk for her own desires.

3336
02:50:40,370 --> 02:50:41,230
Don't worry.

3337
02:50:41,510 --> 02:50:42,710
You were under my protection.

3338
02:50:43,670 --> 02:50:44,510
This time.

3339
02:50:44,970 --> 02:50:47,050
What do you mean your protection?

3340
02:50:47,830 --> 02:50:49,330
You need to draw some conclusions.

3341
02:50:50,410 --> 02:50:52,990
What do you think... What did you think about today?

3342
02:50:54,070 --> 02:50:54,950
I did what I could.

3343
02:50:55,030 --> 02:50:55,970
I made some mistakes.

3344
02:50:56,570 --> 02:50:58,030
I'm not going to answer you.

3345
02:50:58,110 --> 02:50:59,490
Why are you so interested in me?

3346
02:51:01,050 --> 02:51:02,630
I don't think I made any mistakes.

3347
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:04,550
I think I did everything perfectly well.

3348
02:51:07,070 --> 02:51:08,630
Do you like me voice?

3349
02:51:08,830 --> 02:51:09,710
Why do you like me?

3350
02:51:09,710 --> 02:51:12,310
Why are you so interested?

3351
02:51:12,870 --> 02:51:13,990
Any preacher knows.

3352
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:16,670
Once you understand how to reach the most stubborn soul.

3353
02:51:16,890 --> 02:51:19,850
You'll understand how to get into the hearts of everyone else.

3354
02:51:31,950 --> 02:51:33,770
Because I'm so stubborn.

3355
02:51:34,030 --> 02:51:35,570
Because I'm not...

3356
02:51:36,430 --> 02:51:36,870
Wait.

3357
02:51:36,990 --> 02:51:38,090
Is this... I can't tell.

3358
02:51:38,150 --> 02:51:39,570
Is the infection like...

3359
02:51:40,610 --> 02:51:41,130
Sentient?

3360
02:51:42,370 --> 02:51:42,950
You think?

3361
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:45,970
Maybe the infection is sentient.

3362
02:51:46,570 --> 02:51:48,470
And is like...

3363
02:51:48,470 --> 02:51:52,470
Trying to figure out how to take over control of me because I'm so stubborn.

3364
02:51:54,990 --> 02:51:58,170
And then... If they know how to take control of me, they'll be like...

3365
02:51:58,170 --> 02:52:01,270
I can apply that to anybody else who I haven't taken control of.

3366
02:52:06,820 --> 02:52:07,260
Lovecraftian?

3367
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:13,500
It's time to end this conversation.

3368
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:14,780
Good morning.

3369
02:52:14,980 --> 02:52:15,420
Good morning!

3370
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:21,540
Can I leave?

3371
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:26,960
Oh my god.

3372
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:29,460
I can't see anything.

3373
02:52:30,780 --> 02:52:32,320
My space lady!

3374
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:34,300
Gosh, I have so many ladies.

3375
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:35,500
I got goth lady.

3376
02:52:35,940 --> 02:52:36,920
I got white lady.

3377
02:52:37,300 --> 02:52:38,380
I got space lady.

3378
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:41,580
Why am I so tiny?

3379
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:42,740
I've gotten tinier.

3380
02:52:42,740 --> 02:52:47,220
Thank you for opening up to me.

3381
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:48,980
I feel that we've become closer.

3382
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:51,060
There are almost no barriers left.

3383
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:51,700
Really?

3384
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,040
I feel like we have quite a few barriers.

3385
02:52:54,320 --> 02:52:55,080
Leave me alone!

3386
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:57,640
Is that why you come to me?

3387
02:52:57,960 --> 02:52:59,140
What are you doing to us?

3388
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:03,960
I don't want to get on her bad side though.

3389
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:08,060
Is she the infection?

3390
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:11,200
I feel like we're starting to really not trust her though.

3391
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:14,320
What is...OK.

3392
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:18,060
A ghost man never makes any mistakes.

3393
02:53:18,480 --> 02:53:18,880
They teehee!

3394
02:53:20,660 --> 02:53:21,920
Precisely when they mean to.

3395
02:53:23,240 --> 02:53:23,720
Teehee!

3396
02:53:27,810 --> 02:53:30,830
What are you doing to us?

3397
02:53:32,230 --> 02:53:33,430
The confession is over.

3398
02:53:33,910 --> 02:53:34,190
Go.

3399
02:53:35,110 --> 02:53:36,570
You have difficult days ahead of you.

3400
02:53:36,570 --> 02:53:37,010
No!

3401
02:53:44,410 --> 02:53:44,970
Selection.

3402
02:53:45,530 --> 02:53:46,570
What does that mean?

3403
02:53:46,790 --> 02:53:48,470
Oh, day 7.

3404
02:53:50,930 --> 02:53:52,990
You have survived until the beginning of the 7th day.

3405
02:53:55,630 --> 02:53:56,570
Good morning.

3406
02:54:00,910 --> 02:54:04,370
You know, just infected people things.

3407
02:54:04,430 --> 02:54:05,050
Don't worry about it.

3408
02:54:07,090 --> 02:54:09,410
I think we have enough for a couple more days.

3409
02:54:12,670 --> 02:54:14,630
Could you check on the water in the bathroom?

3410
02:54:15,250 --> 02:54:16,650
Yesterday it almost dried out.

3411
02:54:20,310 --> 02:54:23,230
We should try to collect it in something just in case.

3412
02:54:25,990 --> 02:54:27,010
In my mouth.

3413
02:54:28,950 --> 02:54:30,210
I hate this channel.

3414
02:54:30,730 --> 02:54:31,510
This one sucks.

3415
02:54:31,650 --> 02:54:32,610
Oh, let's listen to the news.

3416
02:54:32,710 --> 02:54:33,350
Did they kill a person?

3417
02:54:34,490 --> 02:54:35,870
I am a voice.

3418
02:54:36,590 --> 02:54:37,610
I voice.

3419
02:54:38,250 --> 02:54:39,670
I voice.

3420
02:54:41,910 --> 02:54:46,450
I voice, I voice, I voice, voice, voice, voice.

3421
02:54:47,070 --> 02:54:47,950
I am voice.

3422
02:54:48,030 --> 02:54:50,670
OK, voice is really starting to look like not a word right now.

3423
02:54:54,310 --> 02:54:55,550
Anything more upbeat?

3424
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:01,060
OK, whatever.

3425
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:02,760
We gotta check on the water.

3426
02:55:03,720 --> 02:55:06,140
I am voice, voice, voice, voice.

3427
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:12,480
Oh no.

3428
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:14,560
No, there is no water.

3429
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:28,420
Let's look for bottles of water.

3430
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:34,080
OK.

3431
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:40,760
Alright, we'll call the watcher.

3432
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:44,180
Yeah, welcome to membership.

3433
02:55:44,440 --> 02:55:44,900
Thank you.

3434
02:55:45,100 --> 02:55:47,060
Oh, we also have another pamphlet to call.

3435
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:50,460
Oh wait, this one doesn't have a number.

3436
02:55:51,020 --> 02:55:53,560
But this one, the government lies.

3437
02:55:53,900 --> 02:55:55,260
Hold on, I'm turning this off real quick.

3438
02:55:56,140 --> 02:55:56,480
Goodbye.

3439
02:55:58,380 --> 02:55:59,740
Pick up the phone.

3440
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:01,440
Hold on, we want to call the government.

3441
02:56:01,540 --> 02:56:02,200
6-6.

3442
02:56:04,060 --> 02:56:08,920
3-1-4 Oh yeah, baby.

3443
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:12,560
Hello, government.

3444
02:56:13,480 --> 02:56:14,160
Who is this?

3445
02:56:14,300 --> 02:56:15,000
Are you one of them?

3446
02:56:16,780 --> 02:56:17,280
Yes.

3447
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:20,600
So, the world government has finally found me.

3448
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:22,120
I knew this would happen.

3449
02:56:23,380 --> 02:56:26,120
I will still tell everyone the truth about what is really happening.

3450
02:56:29,480 --> 02:56:30,360
What truth?

3451
02:56:31,820 --> 02:56:33,240
About what's happening on the streets.

3452
02:56:33,360 --> 02:56:34,820
You understand what this means, right?

3453
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:38,740
Hey, I turned that off.

3454
02:56:39,780 --> 02:56:42,400
The world government doesn't need those who can think.

3455
02:56:42,780 --> 02:56:44,640
They only need slaves and soldiers.

3456
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:46,860
Oh my gosh, it's Mother Base.

3457
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:52,720
Some will work on building the new order, while others will destroy all opposition.

3458
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,180
They don't even need us all.

3459
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:01,280
A billion or even less will suffice.

3460
02:57:01,720 --> 02:57:03,300
That's why the massacre began.

3461
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:05,360
Is this One Piece?

3462
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:06,740
Is this what One Piece is about?

3463
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:09,880
Only the most loyal and strong will remain.

3464
02:57:11,980 --> 02:57:13,500
How do they do it?

3465
02:57:14,120 --> 02:57:14,640
Water!

3466
02:57:15,060 --> 02:57:16,340
It's all in the water, buddy.

3467
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:21,140
That's what we need.

3468
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:23,920
They add chemicals to it.

3469
02:57:24,300 --> 02:57:27,340
A wild mix of psychotropic substances and mutagens.

3470
02:57:27,700 --> 02:57:32,560
They make you see what you want while they mold your body into what they want.

3471
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:35,340
But I know how to get around it.

3472
02:57:35,560 --> 02:57:36,580
No water!

3473
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:38,900
Only coffee.

3474
02:57:40,700 --> 02:57:42,260
Lots of coffee!

3475
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:44,100
And vodka.

3476
02:57:46,180 --> 02:57:48,080
Maybe he is on to something.

3477
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:51,880
The world government?

3478
02:57:52,840 --> 02:57:55,620
Banks, corporations, fast food chains, garbage collectors.

3479
02:57:55,980 --> 02:57:57,540
Even the garbage collectors.

3480
02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:00,220
They are all part of the world government.

3481
02:58:01,460 --> 02:58:02,500
It's Russian.

3482
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:04,240
All because he said vodka?

3483
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:07,860
They hid aliens, conducted experiments on US citizens.

3484
02:58:08,120 --> 02:58:10,140
They pretended that the USSR had collapsed.

3485
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:11,520
But I know the truth.

3486
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:14,800
All of this was just a preparation for what is happening now.

3487
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:18,500
I think I shouldn't have called.

3488
02:58:19,360 --> 02:58:22,120
Many people prefer to close their eyes after learning the truth.

3489
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:24,560
They imagine that all of this doesn't exist.

3490
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:25,820
That it's all a fiction.

3491
02:58:26,540 --> 02:58:28,180
They laughed at me when I tried to tell them.

3492
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:29,440
Who is laughing now?

3493
02:58:31,720 --> 02:58:33,540
No one, because they are all dead.

3494
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:35,180
I'm so lonely.

3495
02:58:36,520 --> 02:58:38,080
Someone is knocking on the hatch.

3496
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:39,080
I've been found.

3497
02:58:39,380 --> 02:58:41,600
They probably tapped the phone.

3498
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:42,560
It's OK.

3499
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:44,180
I won't give up without a fight.

3500
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:47,380
Meet my double barrel, you Illuminati bitches!

3501
02:58:52,700 --> 02:58:55,740
He really did... I thought we were going to learn about aliens.

3502
02:58:56,740 --> 02:58:57,860
What about the aliens?

3503
02:59:01,400 --> 02:59:03,080
Oh man, they got him.

3504
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:04,780
OK.

3505
02:59:05,180 --> 02:59:06,800
Oh yeah, I was calling the watcher.

3506
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:09,560
Uh...

3507
02:59:10,520 --> 02:59:11,400
Oh, 007.

3508
02:59:19,470 --> 02:59:20,950
Security post, how can I help?

3509
02:59:24,870 --> 02:59:26,750
We are out of water in our room.

3510
02:59:27,710 --> 02:59:30,610
You know, you are the only guest who always got something to complain about.

3511
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:32,630
Monsters in the hallway, no water.

3512
02:59:32,890 --> 02:59:33,970
You are a terrible client.

3513
02:59:35,050 --> 02:59:35,990
I hate this guy.

3514
02:59:37,390 --> 02:59:39,710
But then again, the other guests are either dead or insane.

3515
02:59:39,710 --> 02:59:42,150
So there is not much of a comparison.

3516
02:59:43,210 --> 02:59:44,770
Are you joking about this?

3517
02:59:45,030 --> 02:59:45,650
Are you joking?

3518
02:59:45,810 --> 02:59:48,450
I'm literally about to die of dehydration and you are joking?

3519
02:59:49,970 --> 02:59:51,530
I can only eat so many donuts.

3520
02:59:52,390 --> 02:59:53,170
So what's up again?

3521
02:59:54,250 --> 02:59:55,390
Uh, we are out of water?

3522
02:59:58,310 --> 02:59:58,890
Ah, right.

3523
02:59:59,110 --> 03:00:00,670
Looks like the emergency pump has failed.

3524
03:00:01,050 --> 03:00:02,330
It needs to be restarted.

3525
03:00:03,730 --> 03:00:05,410
I'm going to have to be the one to do it all.

3526
03:00:05,730 --> 03:00:07,890
Come down to me on the first floor.

3527
03:00:07,890 --> 03:00:09,070
Find the security room.

3528
03:00:09,130 --> 03:00:10,230
It's behind the reception desk.

3529
03:00:10,850 --> 03:00:12,290
I'll guide you from there.

3530
03:00:12,430 --> 03:00:13,270
Wait, he's going to lead me?

3531
03:00:14,390 --> 03:00:16,010
This will be my first time meeting him.

3532
03:00:16,490 --> 03:00:16,890
Interesting.

3533
03:00:19,050 --> 03:00:20,650
Why don't you fix the pump yourself?

3534
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:23,870
Yeah, why doesn't this guy do anything?

3535
03:00:25,390 --> 03:00:25,790
Because...

3536
03:00:26,990 --> 03:00:27,790
I'm busy.

3537
03:00:27,990 --> 03:00:28,590
Oh my god.

3538
03:00:28,770 --> 03:00:30,390
I'm trying to establish communication.

3539
03:00:30,890 --> 03:00:32,770
This is a much more important task for all of us.

3540
03:00:32,890 --> 03:00:33,470
See you later.

3541
03:00:34,250 --> 03:00:35,190
He hung up.

3542
03:00:35,270 --> 03:00:36,090
What a coward.

3543
03:00:37,930 --> 03:00:39,690
We need to go downstairs.

3544
03:00:40,350 --> 03:00:40,990
Aren't we?

3545
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:46,850
He annoys me so much.

3546
03:00:47,890 --> 03:00:49,430
Is he going to turn on us, I think?

3547
03:00:50,190 --> 03:00:52,970
He's like doing something secretive to...

3548
03:00:54,730 --> 03:00:55,270
To...

3549
03:00:55,270 --> 03:00:56,430
I don't know.

3550
03:00:57,210 --> 03:00:57,750
He's...

3551
03:00:57,750 --> 03:01:00,450
He's the one who shut off the water.

3552
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:09,280
We haven't been out for a long time.

3553
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:12,360
I don't even know what's going on there now.

3554
03:01:13,080 --> 03:01:14,360
You, thirsty for water.

3555
03:01:14,500 --> 03:01:16,020
Him, thirsty for sick burns.

3556
03:01:17,720 --> 03:01:19,700
No, her, thirsty for water.

3557
03:01:19,940 --> 03:01:21,480
Him, thirsty for sick burns.

3558
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:23,560
Us, thirsty for goth girl.

3559
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:28,560
Tell you what.

3560
03:01:29,060 --> 03:01:31,620
I'll go out first and open the door to the stairs for you.

3561
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:33,620
You'll wait a little and follow.

3562
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:35,020
Oh, okay.

3563
03:01:35,800 --> 03:01:38,200
Wait, yeah, we've been in our room for a couple days.

3564
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:41,960
We went from like day 3 to day 7 or something.

3565
03:01:42,440 --> 03:01:43,100
Let's stay separate.

3566
03:01:43,880 --> 03:01:45,860
This way there will be less chance of being noticed.

3567
03:01:46,140 --> 03:01:47,440
Okay, that works for me.

3568
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:50,800
Where will you go?

3569
03:01:51,340 --> 03:01:52,360
I'll check the first floor.

3570
03:01:52,920 --> 03:01:55,040
Maybe I can snag something from the vending machines.

3571
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:56,440
Yeah, okay, nice.

3572
03:01:57,440 --> 03:02:00,020
Okay, I'll go out first and you'll follow.

3573
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:01,500
Walk towards the stairs.

3574
03:02:02,220 --> 03:02:02,720
Good luck.

3575
03:02:03,080 --> 03:02:05,400
Okay, I wish we could turn off the radio.

3576
03:02:05,900 --> 03:02:07,200
It's so...

3577
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,280
Why can't this turn on?

3578
03:02:11,360 --> 03:02:11,920
Maybe...

3579
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:15,060
Like, it's so annoying because it's so loud.

3580
03:02:17,080 --> 03:02:18,240
Now, turn off.

3581
03:02:18,860 --> 03:02:19,860
Alright, there we go.

3582
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:20,900
Okay.

3583
03:02:24,480 --> 03:02:26,060
I'm heading to the stairs.

3584
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:28,800
Oh, our graffiti.

3585
03:02:30,620 --> 03:02:31,880
What the hell was that?

3586
03:02:32,700 --> 03:02:34,100
Oh, the light.

3587
03:02:34,220 --> 03:02:34,740
Oh my god.

3588
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:40,880
Oh...

3589
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:47,880
She's so brave.

3590
03:02:48,540 --> 03:02:50,020
You really are like Raiden.

3591
03:02:50,120 --> 03:02:52,540
The way the washer keeps bossing you around.

3592
03:02:59,750 --> 03:03:01,330
Young man, do you have a minute?

3593
03:03:01,550 --> 03:03:02,550
I'd like to talk to you.

3594
03:03:03,450 --> 03:03:04,630
What else should I do?

3595
03:03:05,490 --> 03:03:05,970
Sure.

3596
03:03:06,610 --> 03:03:08,390
I'm working on a theory of infection.

3597
03:03:08,390 --> 03:03:10,110
But there are some inconsistencies.

3598
03:03:10,430 --> 03:03:12,170
I need an outside opinion.

3599
03:03:12,370 --> 03:03:12,570
Okay.

3600
03:03:14,470 --> 03:03:17,810
The first question is about the variety of physical changes in the victims.

3601
03:03:18,290 --> 03:03:21,150
You've encountered these unfortunate people much more than I have.

3602
03:03:22,090 --> 03:03:23,610
How does this guy have enough food?

3603
03:03:24,430 --> 03:03:26,590
What do you think influences their differences?

3604
03:03:30,290 --> 03:03:32,630
The amount of infection affects them?

3605
03:03:33,130 --> 03:03:35,610
They depend on personality and experiences?

3606
03:03:35,610 --> 03:03:37,670
The changes seem random.

3607
03:03:38,390 --> 03:03:39,430
I don't know.

3608
03:03:39,870 --> 03:03:41,700
I don't think it's a personality and experience.

3609
03:03:42,590 --> 03:03:43,110
I don't know.

3610
03:03:43,650 --> 03:03:44,970
Maybe it's the amount of the affection.

3611
03:03:45,210 --> 03:03:47,230
Because the lady would change.

3612
03:03:47,990 --> 03:03:49,690
But she wasn't fully infected.

3613
03:03:50,950 --> 03:03:51,770
And then that...

3614
03:03:51,770 --> 03:03:55,170
The bald guy seemed completely infected.

3615
03:03:55,750 --> 03:03:58,410
And he was like an actual monster.

3616
03:03:59,110 --> 03:03:59,670
Right?

3617
03:04:02,470 --> 03:04:03,930
We don't know, Minto.

3618
03:04:03,930 --> 03:04:06,590
This is me theorizing.

3619
03:04:08,150 --> 03:04:08,550
Three?

3620
03:04:08,770 --> 03:04:09,550
You think it's three?

3621
03:04:10,030 --> 03:04:11,030
I think it's per individual.

3622
03:04:11,310 --> 03:04:13,950
Each person is a way different monster.

3623
03:04:18,750 --> 03:04:20,350
I think it's four though.

3624
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:23,130
I think it's four.

3625
03:04:23,250 --> 03:04:24,490
Like I said, I think it's...

3626
03:04:24,490 --> 03:04:25,190
I don't know.

3627
03:04:27,130 --> 03:04:30,030
But I guess it does... I don't know if it's personality based.

3628
03:04:30,090 --> 03:04:32,170
I think it's how much the affection...

3629
03:04:32,170 --> 03:04:32,470
Right?

3630
03:04:32,930 --> 03:04:33,670
I don't know.

3631
03:04:34,090 --> 03:04:35,230
Okay, everybody is saying three.

3632
03:04:35,330 --> 03:04:35,790
I'll do three.

3633
03:04:36,830 --> 03:04:38,130
Alright, next question.

3634
03:04:39,210 --> 03:04:40,970
One of the first signs of changes is nightmares.

3635
03:04:41,430 --> 03:04:44,590
As I understand it, their essence varies depending on the victim's experience.

3636
03:04:45,030 --> 03:04:46,590
But is there something common in them?

3637
03:04:51,350 --> 03:04:53,130
Isn't this gonna just...

3638
03:04:53,810 --> 03:04:55,190
Isn't this gonna rat us out?

3639
03:04:58,650 --> 03:05:00,410
Isn't this gonna rat us out?

3640
03:05:01,770 --> 03:05:03,590
How do we know it's water though?

3641
03:05:06,330 --> 03:05:08,010
Those are just our nightmares.

3642
03:05:10,650 --> 03:05:12,270
I'm gonna say how should I know.

3643
03:05:12,810 --> 03:05:13,130
I see.

3644
03:05:13,410 --> 03:05:13,610
Alright.

3645
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:16,430
Now let's talk about the level of physical changes.

3646
03:05:16,630 --> 03:05:17,710
How noticeable are they?

3647
03:05:18,490 --> 03:05:19,590
People turn into monsters!

3648
03:05:20,230 --> 03:05:22,650
Let's just say, quite noticeable.

3649
03:05:24,270 --> 03:05:25,550
I barely notice a difference.

3650
03:05:26,130 --> 03:05:28,870
People are turning into monsters, Mr. Neighbor.

3651
03:05:30,530 --> 03:05:31,150
Is that so?

3652
03:05:31,530 --> 03:05:32,050
Curious.

3653
03:05:32,390 --> 03:05:33,810
Alright, I'm ready to draw a conclusion.

3654
03:05:34,110 --> 03:05:37,970
Okay, we're really doing the scientific method here.

3655
03:05:37,970 --> 03:05:40,790
We call this condition an infection.

3656
03:05:41,850 --> 03:05:43,850
It seems that it's not quite right.

3657
03:05:44,950 --> 03:05:48,910
We are observing an impossible manifestation of psychosomatics.

3658
03:05:49,190 --> 03:05:52,030
The psychological state generates changes in the body.

3659
03:05:53,690 --> 03:05:56,310
The laws of our universe do not allow such changes.

3660
03:05:57,130 --> 03:05:59,430
Whatever caused them, it came from outside.

3661
03:06:01,950 --> 03:06:02,590
Aliens!

3662
03:06:04,530 --> 03:06:05,170
Aliens!

3663
03:06:05,170 --> 03:06:08,450
I'm talking about a dimension with completely different rules.

3664
03:06:08,870 --> 03:06:12,670
About a place where thought is as real as a physical object.

3665
03:06:13,730 --> 03:06:15,610
I don't have enough data to say more.

3666
03:06:16,130 --> 03:06:18,850
Thank you for helping me understand this issue a bit better, young man.

3667
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:25,550
Aliens.

3668
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:38,340
Alright, so far so good, I suppose.

3669
03:06:44,860 --> 03:06:46,060
Wait, there's someone in here?

3670
03:06:50,250 --> 03:06:51,690
And the priest got her?

3671
03:06:52,350 --> 03:06:54,510
I think this is the symbol of the priest, right?

3672
03:06:56,950 --> 03:06:58,390
But she's still alive.

3673
03:06:58,930 --> 03:07:00,650
So I guess she's fine.

3674
03:07:00,810 --> 03:07:01,930
Hello, are you okay in there?

3675
03:07:02,070 --> 03:07:02,350
Okay.

3676
03:07:15,370 --> 03:07:15,810
Well...

3677
03:07:19,330 --> 03:07:21,130
So much for that, I think.

3678
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:25,720
Gosh, that's a lot of blood.

3679
03:07:30,170 --> 03:07:33,010
Oh, he's been going around on everybody.

3680
03:07:33,190 --> 03:07:34,650
Look, he's been covering them up.

3681
03:07:36,290 --> 03:07:39,650
This guy has like total control of this hallway.

3682
03:07:39,950 --> 03:07:40,750
Oh my god.

3683
03:07:43,030 --> 03:07:44,350
Look, this door too.

3684
03:07:46,630 --> 03:07:47,670
Oh my god.

3685
03:07:48,430 --> 03:07:50,230
There was somebody in here also.

3686
03:07:50,230 --> 03:07:51,550
And this one too.

3687
03:07:52,070 --> 03:07:53,090
Oh my god.

3688
03:07:53,910 --> 03:07:55,810
This guy is just taking control of everything.

3689
03:07:57,470 --> 03:07:58,910
Maybe he's infected.

3690
03:07:59,850 --> 03:08:00,850
I don't know.

3691
03:08:01,530 --> 03:08:02,430
Time to go downstairs?

3692
03:08:03,170 --> 03:08:03,830
Here we go.

3693
03:08:10,500 --> 03:08:11,660
What's that sound?

3694
03:08:11,980 --> 03:08:12,500
Motorcycle?

3695
03:08:13,400 --> 03:08:14,100
Or a helicopter?

3696
03:08:17,960 --> 03:08:19,180
Second floor.

3697
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:19,220
Third floor.

3698
03:08:21,740 --> 03:08:23,580
Can we go to this floor?

3699
03:08:24,700 --> 03:08:24,980
No.

3700
03:08:25,640 --> 03:08:28,300
It looks like I don't want to go there anyway.

3701
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:35,740
Oh shit.

3702
03:08:44,100 --> 03:08:45,380
Maybe that's what we heard.

3703
03:08:50,360 --> 03:08:51,900
It just saved.

3704
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Do you think I can go downstairs?

3705
03:08:53,140 --> 03:08:54,580
Maybe he'll walk away.

3706
03:08:55,780 --> 03:08:57,180
Mary, thanks for the five gifted.

3707
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:00,640
I don't think that's friend.

3708
03:09:05,630 --> 03:09:07,010
I need to distract him.

3709
03:09:07,130 --> 03:09:08,770
I'll try to throw something down the stairs.

3710
03:09:08,950 --> 03:09:11,130
I just had to get closer.

3711
03:09:12,390 --> 03:09:13,450
We can take that.

3712
03:09:13,530 --> 03:09:14,730
Is there anything else we can take?

3713
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:21,710
Nevermind.

3714
03:09:23,290 --> 03:09:24,170
I'll take this.

3715
03:09:26,970 --> 03:09:27,570
And...

3716
03:09:28,430 --> 03:09:29,030
Push.

3717
03:09:31,010 --> 03:09:31,590
Push.

3718
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:33,310
Push.

3719
03:09:38,880 --> 03:09:40,600
Oh my god, he's looking right at me.

3720
03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:42,280
I think he noticed me.

3721
03:09:54,020 --> 03:09:56,900
I have to let go when he's not sensing.

3722
03:09:58,360 --> 03:09:59,880
I'll do it after the next one.

3723
03:10:04,300 --> 03:10:05,160
I think we're good.

3724
03:10:06,340 --> 03:10:08,920
Oh my god, I opened it so slowly.

3725
03:10:09,020 --> 03:10:10,400
I opened it so quietly.

3726
03:10:10,600 --> 03:10:11,200
Good job, guy.

3727
03:10:11,860 --> 03:10:12,540
Good job.

3728
03:10:13,820 --> 03:10:15,400
They're on the first floor now?

3729
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:17,320
Okay, I think we're safe.

3730
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:21,920
I can barely see anything outside.

3731
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:25,740
The note.

3732
03:10:26,960 --> 03:10:29,360
He likes to call himself the Watcher.

3733
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:31,600
This guy is such a weirdo.

3734
03:10:31,840 --> 03:10:33,240
He says it's not just a job.

3735
03:10:33,320 --> 03:10:35,320
He has the same call sign back in the army.

3736
03:10:35,900 --> 03:10:37,480
And he calls me a slug.

3737
03:10:38,100 --> 03:10:38,560
What?

3738
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:40,920
He thinks I can't hear it.

3739
03:10:41,200 --> 03:10:42,440
Why is he always so silent?

3740
03:10:43,100 --> 03:10:43,520
Jerk.

3741
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:44,360
Go there.

3742
03:10:44,500 --> 03:10:45,100
Do this.

3743
03:10:45,340 --> 03:10:47,320
I know why you don't do anything yourself.

3744
03:10:47,940 --> 03:10:48,860
Wheel-legged?

3745
03:10:59,400 --> 03:11:01,540
That's why he can't help.

3746
03:11:03,640 --> 03:11:05,760
He's just doing his best.

3747
03:11:06,980 --> 03:11:07,640
Oh no.

3748
03:11:09,440 --> 03:11:11,480
He's probably like...

3749
03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:15,100
Yeah, he probably has no legs from the war or something.

3750
03:11:15,260 --> 03:11:16,300
Oh my gosh.

3751
03:11:17,220 --> 03:11:18,560
Where is our girlfriend?

3752
03:11:19,740 --> 03:11:21,380
Goth GF, where are you?

3753
03:11:22,480 --> 03:11:23,420
I'm scared.

3754
03:11:24,040 --> 03:11:26,860
What if a monster notices me from the windows?

3755
03:11:29,280 --> 03:11:32,700
This is our first time on the first floor, so...

3756
03:11:32,700 --> 03:11:33,880
What's that sound?

3757
03:11:37,220 --> 03:11:39,480
Oh gosh, there's new monsters down here.

3758
03:11:40,340 --> 03:11:41,320
Anything over here?

3759
03:11:41,440 --> 03:11:41,980
Any gum?

3760
03:11:42,480 --> 03:11:43,760
Any Riz Gum?

3761
03:11:45,640 --> 03:11:46,480
Kariz Gum?

3762
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,400
That would be a great brand, right?

3763
03:11:49,820 --> 03:11:52,420
This is how it feels to chew Riz Gum.

3764
03:11:55,280 --> 03:11:55,860
Okay.

3765
03:11:58,640 --> 03:12:02,240
Alright, let's just go towards the spooky noises I guess.

3766
03:12:03,980 --> 03:12:07,260
Sounds like an awesome plan.

3767
03:12:07,380 --> 03:12:08,900
There's actually no blood down here.

3768
03:12:18,070 --> 03:12:19,220
Who said shh?

3769
03:12:24,410 --> 03:12:25,530
That was creepy.

3770
03:12:29,600 --> 03:12:31,060
Can we go to the pool?

3771
03:12:35,100 --> 03:12:35,560
Nope.

3772
03:12:35,700 --> 03:12:37,480
Okay, let's go to the security guard.

3773
03:12:41,770 --> 03:12:42,750
I saw something.

3774
03:12:43,630 --> 03:12:44,890
Yeah, rip the monitors.

3775
03:12:46,470 --> 03:12:49,370
I thought I just heard something open up.

3776
03:12:49,430 --> 03:12:49,970
Oh my god.

3777
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:50,630
Hello?

3778
03:12:51,730 --> 03:12:52,450
It's me.

3779
03:12:52,650 --> 03:12:53,310
Can I come in?

3780
03:12:55,710 --> 03:12:56,570
No, sorry.

3781
03:12:57,350 --> 03:12:57,810
I...

3782
03:12:58,390 --> 03:13:01,310
I barricaded myself in here and it won't be quick to open.

3783
03:13:02,650 --> 03:13:04,470
But I'm glad to hear your voice in person.

3784
03:13:04,470 --> 03:13:07,430
I think we could have done this over the phone.

3785
03:13:07,530 --> 03:13:08,130
Could we not?

3786
03:13:08,310 --> 03:13:09,470
Because like...

3787
03:13:11,090 --> 03:13:15,790
Now I'm like talking very loudly in the wide open.

3788
03:13:18,790 --> 03:13:20,170
What are you hiding in there?

3789
03:13:20,670 --> 03:13:21,770
I'm not hiding anything.

3790
03:13:22,650 --> 03:13:23,890
He's hiding himself.

3791
03:13:25,550 --> 03:13:27,150
And if I am, it's none of your business.

3792
03:13:29,210 --> 03:13:31,110
You need to go to the swimming pool wing.

3793
03:13:31,110 --> 03:13:34,950
Go into the main hall and turn right to the elevator.

3794
03:13:36,450 --> 03:13:38,690
To the left of it you'll see an entrance to the pool.

3795
03:13:39,070 --> 03:13:39,670
Go there.

3796
03:13:40,110 --> 03:13:42,390
You'll need to find the boiler room and restart the pump.

3797
03:13:43,310 --> 03:13:44,350
How do I start it?

3798
03:13:45,970 --> 03:13:48,090
The staff left instructions in the boiler room.

3799
03:13:48,210 --> 03:13:49,110
You can handle it.

3800
03:13:49,770 --> 03:13:50,430
Just be careful.

3801
03:13:50,590 --> 03:13:53,150
There are no cameras in the pool so I won't be able to help you.

3802
03:13:54,590 --> 03:13:56,970
Also lately I've been hearing some kind of rumble from there.

3803
03:13:57,770 --> 03:13:59,210
I don't know what it is.

3804
03:14:00,050 --> 03:14:00,810
Gosh.

3805
03:14:03,910 --> 03:14:04,970
Good luck kid.

3806
03:14:06,350 --> 03:14:07,310
Oh no.

3807
03:14:08,230 --> 03:14:09,210
I don't like that.

3808
03:14:09,510 --> 03:14:11,210
What kind of rumble?

3809
03:14:11,410 --> 03:14:13,770
What kind of monster are we gonna face?

3810
03:14:14,210 --> 03:14:15,370
No, please.

3811
03:14:20,710 --> 03:14:22,530
Oh my god.

3812
03:14:23,650 --> 03:14:24,450
Swim trunks.

3813
03:14:28,160 --> 03:14:29,740
Actually, let's keep this open.

3814
03:14:32,380 --> 03:14:33,680
Anything behind here?

3815
03:14:33,780 --> 03:14:34,580
Anything to take?

3816
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:36,140
I'm looting.

3817
03:14:36,280 --> 03:14:36,720
I'm looting.

3818
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,280
Actually, there hasn't been much in this game to loot, huh?

3819
03:14:41,180 --> 03:14:43,200
Looks like you could use a hand.

3820
03:14:43,300 --> 03:14:44,420
Let's go to the women's bathroom.

3821
03:14:44,620 --> 03:14:45,120
We can't.

3822
03:14:45,120 --> 03:14:45,480
Just kidding.

3823
03:14:45,580 --> 03:14:46,600
Let's go to the men's bathroom.

3824
03:14:48,660 --> 03:14:49,100
Nevermind.

3825
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:54,040
Let's...

3826
03:14:55,040 --> 03:14:56,100
Are you kidding?

3827
03:14:56,240 --> 03:14:56,860
Wait, what was that?

3828
03:14:57,840 --> 03:14:58,800
Oh, read the note.

3829
03:15:00,520 --> 03:15:03,500
Why is he lucky enough to be so good looking and not me?

3830
03:15:04,360 --> 03:15:06,680
Why does he have such a good figure and I don't?

3831
03:15:07,180 --> 03:15:08,640
Sure, he can be proud of himself.

3832
03:15:08,920 --> 03:15:09,980
I know his secret.

3833
03:15:10,340 --> 03:15:11,940
I know what he's taking.

3834
03:15:14,040 --> 03:15:14,440
Drop?

3835
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:14,800
Why?

3836
03:15:14,900 --> 03:15:15,680
Who wrote this?

3837
03:15:17,480 --> 03:15:20,900
Who wrote this and left it in the swimming pool area?

3838
03:15:24,680 --> 03:15:26,080
There might be gum in the bathroom.

3839
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:27,440
It won't let me go in there.

3840
03:15:28,960 --> 03:15:31,120
We have to go this way.

3841
03:15:31,340 --> 03:15:33,540
This is the only way we can go.

3842
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:38,380
But flashing lights warning, I guess, because it's kind of...

3843
03:15:38,380 --> 03:15:39,640
I'm checking to see if there's anything.

3844
03:15:39,760 --> 03:15:40,140
Okay, no.

3845
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:42,000
Okay.

3846
03:15:42,700 --> 03:15:43,300
Yeah, I see.

3847
03:15:44,600 --> 03:15:45,700
Alright, here we go.

3848
03:15:45,860 --> 03:15:47,040
Into the men's bathroom.

3849
03:15:49,060 --> 03:15:50,880
Oh my god, it's so dark.

3850
03:15:51,640 --> 03:15:52,480
Oh god.

3851
03:15:53,300 --> 03:15:54,580
It's so dark in here.

3852
03:15:57,440 --> 03:15:57,960
Gum!

3853
03:15:59,560 --> 03:16:00,160
Yes!

3854
03:16:02,140 --> 03:16:03,980
Alright, we'll use it next time.

3855
03:16:04,220 --> 03:16:05,680
Any gum in the stall?

3856
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:08,520
Okay, that won't open.

3857
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:09,000
Alright.

3858
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:12,680
It's so spooky.

3859
03:16:17,780 --> 03:16:18,380
Okay.

3860
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:20,960
The atmosphere in this game is pretty good.

3861
03:16:22,680 --> 03:16:23,240
Oh god.

3862
03:16:23,240 --> 03:16:24,500
Oh god.

3863
03:16:24,660 --> 03:16:24,780
Ew!

3864
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:28,600
Poor...

3865
03:16:29,240 --> 03:16:31,600
Poor schmuck died in the shower.

3866
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:33,280
Okay.

3867
03:16:34,180 --> 03:16:34,840
This way?

3868
03:16:41,940 --> 03:16:47,040
Oh my gosh, at least the flamingo floaty is fine.

3869
03:16:48,990 --> 03:16:49,980
What is this?

3870
03:16:49,980 --> 03:16:51,380
Oh, it's a slipper.

3871
03:16:51,520 --> 03:16:53,660
I was gonna say, what body part is this?

3872
03:16:54,460 --> 03:16:57,240
Oh my god, this guy died in like an epic way.

3873
03:16:59,720 --> 03:17:03,140
Okay, we have to go all the way around.

3874
03:17:03,420 --> 03:17:03,580
Maybe?

3875
03:17:03,940 --> 03:17:05,380
Can we go into the women's?

3876
03:17:09,460 --> 03:17:11,580
Oh my god, how many people died in here?

3877
03:17:12,420 --> 03:17:14,040
For it to be so...

3878
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:15,640
So goopy.

3879
03:17:16,200 --> 03:17:17,140
It's so gross.

3880
03:17:22,180 --> 03:17:23,860
Okay, can't go in there.

3881
03:17:26,960 --> 03:17:28,120
Good soup.

3882
03:17:29,460 --> 03:17:33,120
It's like literal jam, jello up in here.

3883
03:17:33,680 --> 03:17:34,240
Look at that.

3884
03:17:35,380 --> 03:17:36,280
The consistency.

3885
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:38,120
Oh, and it's...

3886
03:17:38,120 --> 03:17:38,120
Ew!

3887
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:39,440
Wait, is it warm?

3888
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:40,700
Is that steam?

3889
03:17:40,820 --> 03:17:41,480
I can't tell.

3890
03:17:42,940 --> 03:17:44,360
Ew, nasty.

3891
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:46,100
Okay.

3892
03:17:47,340 --> 03:17:49,000
Pool depth, pool depth.

3893
03:17:50,920 --> 03:17:52,120
What's over here?

3894
03:17:53,820 --> 03:17:56,420
Oh gosh, wait, there's different pumps?

3895
03:17:57,360 --> 03:17:58,000
Oh no.

3896
03:18:00,100 --> 03:18:01,060
What's that sound?

3897
03:18:04,320 --> 03:18:06,140
Um, I think the monster's...

3898
03:18:07,820 --> 03:18:08,800
Taking a leak.

3899
03:18:09,420 --> 03:18:11,000
Let's go over down here.

3900
03:18:12,340 --> 03:18:13,600
Which pump do you need?

3901
03:18:13,680 --> 03:18:15,460
I don't know, it said there would be instructions.

3902
03:18:16,500 --> 03:18:19,470
I think if we probably go inside one, it will...

3903
03:18:22,960 --> 03:18:24,400
I can't see anything.

3904
03:18:26,280 --> 03:18:28,020
It will probably...

3905
03:18:28,660 --> 03:18:30,860
Oh my god, that injures me.

3906
03:18:32,880 --> 03:18:34,320
Wait, can I not go down here?

3907
03:18:36,260 --> 03:18:37,020
I'm running?

3908
03:18:37,280 --> 03:18:37,500
Okay.

3909
03:18:38,440 --> 03:18:39,660
I don't think there's a way to crouch.

3910
03:18:40,380 --> 03:18:40,600
No.

3911
03:18:41,220 --> 03:18:43,000
Control or C doesn't do anything.

3912
03:18:45,380 --> 03:18:48,080
Oh, we made it to the women's bathroom everybody.

3913
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:52,800
Oh gosh.

3914
03:18:53,280 --> 03:18:54,640
I'm scared of this part.

3915
03:18:55,960 --> 03:18:57,620
I don't like it at all.

3916
03:18:58,580 --> 03:19:00,040
I don't like it, I don't like it.

3917
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:04,220
I don't like it.

3918
03:19:05,180 --> 03:19:07,000
It's really freaking me out.

3919
03:19:19,620 --> 03:19:20,140
Oh.

3920
03:19:20,480 --> 03:19:22,100
It was just like, no peeking.

3921
03:19:25,880 --> 03:19:26,400
Okay.

3922
03:19:28,240 --> 03:19:31,460
Am I supposed to follow the sound of the...

3923
03:19:31,460 --> 03:19:32,720
Oh, that's why we couldn't come in.

3924
03:19:33,980 --> 03:19:35,240
Is there anything in here?

3925
03:19:35,520 --> 03:19:36,900
There were arrows, yeah, see?

3926
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:39,540
I can't see anything though.

3927
03:19:41,440 --> 03:19:43,060
I literally can't see anything.

3928
03:19:46,080 --> 03:19:46,620
Settings.

3929
03:19:47,480 --> 03:19:48,020
Graphics.

3930
03:19:48,480 --> 03:19:48,960
Gamma.

3931
03:19:49,100 --> 03:19:50,980
Sorry guys, I'm turning it up a little bit more.

3932
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:52,660
Oh, that didn't do shit.

3933
03:19:52,980 --> 03:19:54,320
It literally didn't do anything.

3934
03:20:02,330 --> 03:20:02,870
Okay.

3935
03:20:03,990 --> 03:20:06,150
Let's go to an area where we can see.

3936
03:20:11,670 --> 03:20:12,530
Oh god.

3937
03:20:14,950 --> 03:20:17,710
Let's go to an area where the lights are on.

3938
03:20:19,010 --> 03:20:20,090
And functional.

3939
03:20:23,230 --> 03:20:24,870
Time to use the thermal goggles.

3940
03:20:25,090 --> 03:20:28,010
No, I have no... Oh wait, sorry.

3941
03:20:28,210 --> 03:20:30,030
I think I turned it down a little bit.

3942
03:20:30,410 --> 03:20:30,910
Too much.

3943
03:20:31,690 --> 03:20:32,410
Maybe that's better.

3944
03:20:34,130 --> 03:20:35,130
Okay, so we know...

3945
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:45,000
We're just gonna ignore that?

3946
03:20:46,540 --> 03:20:47,620
What was it?

3947
03:20:51,550 --> 03:20:53,170
Okay, don't go in there yet.

3948
03:20:53,310 --> 03:20:55,030
Let's go into the...

3949
03:20:55,830 --> 03:20:56,790
I don't know.

3950
03:21:01,100 --> 03:21:02,380
There's this door too.

3951
03:21:05,320 --> 03:21:06,500
Oh my god.

3952
03:21:06,600 --> 03:21:08,200
Oh my god, it's too scary.

3953
03:21:09,220 --> 03:21:11,040
It's so scary, you guys!

3954
03:21:13,960 --> 03:21:16,120
Oh, I think this is where we need to be.

3955
03:21:19,540 --> 03:21:20,040
Okay.

3956
03:21:20,980 --> 03:21:22,220
I'm brave, I'm brave.

3957
03:21:24,140 --> 03:21:27,060
25 bar, 30 bar, 5 bar, 20 bar.

3958
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:29,400
Oh, this is not where we need to be?

3959
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:30,280
What does this mean?

3960
03:21:32,140 --> 03:21:34,360
This is like the longest tubing ever.

3961
03:21:36,600 --> 03:21:37,960
What does this mean?

3962
03:21:39,200 --> 03:21:41,160
Okay, let's go into the other area.

3963
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:43,060
Does not feel up to code.

3964
03:21:43,180 --> 03:21:44,140
No, not at all.

3965
03:21:48,930 --> 03:21:53,510
At least the flamingo is fine.

3966
03:21:56,250 --> 03:21:57,610
The bar is pressure.

3967
03:21:58,590 --> 03:21:59,550
Okay, okay.

3968
03:22:05,360 --> 03:22:06,880
That doesn't sound good.

3969
03:22:07,660 --> 03:22:09,220
Where did my goth GF go?

3970
03:22:09,760 --> 03:22:11,180
Sorry for flashing lights.

3971
03:22:12,180 --> 03:22:13,500
Oh, we can't go in there.

3972
03:22:15,860 --> 03:22:16,860
Oh, down here.

3973
03:22:17,640 --> 03:22:17,900
Okay.

3974
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:23,020
This place looks like my screensaver from 1999.

3975
03:22:25,300 --> 03:22:25,900
Okay.

3976
03:22:26,900 --> 03:22:29,040
Alright, this seems to be the instructions.

3977
03:22:30,400 --> 03:22:30,860
Nevermind.

3978
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:33,220
I was scolded for falling asleep in the boiler room.

3979
03:22:33,320 --> 03:22:34,520
Why don't they understand?

3980
03:22:34,700 --> 03:22:36,220
It's dark there and no one sees you.

3981
03:22:36,660 --> 03:22:38,420
Water drops bring me good dreams.

3982
03:22:40,260 --> 03:22:42,740
Valid, but also that doesn't help me.

3983
03:22:45,140 --> 03:22:45,600
Rotate.

3984
03:22:47,940 --> 03:22:50,820
There's only three, but there were so many bars.

3985
03:22:51,180 --> 03:22:52,600
There were so many that said bar.

3986
03:22:52,820 --> 03:22:54,140
It's supposed to be a water pressure.

3987
03:23:07,860 --> 03:23:09,100
There are other rooms?

3988
03:23:09,200 --> 03:23:10,660
Yeah, but they were really dark.

3989
03:23:14,260 --> 03:23:15,720
Dark and I'm scared.

3990
03:23:17,900 --> 03:23:19,600
I'm scared of going in there.

3991
03:23:22,600 --> 03:23:24,560
Follow the specific blue pipe.

3992
03:23:25,460 --> 03:23:25,720
Okay.

3993
03:23:26,600 --> 03:23:28,920
Alright, everybody follow this pipe.

3994
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:32,660
This one?

3995
03:23:32,760 --> 03:23:33,620
Okay, it curves.

3996
03:23:34,120 --> 03:23:36,160
And it goes upwards and it goes this way.

3997
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:39,460
Then it goes down and around.

3998
03:23:40,120 --> 03:23:42,520
And up and over.

3999
03:23:43,340 --> 03:23:46,260
And that way and this way and over.

4000
03:23:46,760 --> 03:23:49,860
This seems really unnecessary.

4001
03:23:50,860 --> 03:23:52,120
You had a straight path.

4002
03:23:52,760 --> 03:23:56,320
This way and down this way.

4003
03:23:56,740 --> 03:23:57,420
And over.

4004
03:23:57,860 --> 03:23:59,340
And it's 20!

4005
03:24:02,940 --> 03:24:04,700
20 is our pipe.

4006
03:24:04,700 --> 03:24:06,700
Okay, let's go put 20 on...

4007
03:24:08,660 --> 03:24:09,860
that one.

4008
03:24:10,100 --> 03:24:12,220
Sorry, I know I don't run a lot in this game.

4009
03:24:12,320 --> 03:24:14,720
I'm just afraid of something jumping out at me.

4010
03:24:14,860 --> 03:24:15,960
I hope you guys understand.

4011
03:24:17,160 --> 03:24:21,740
Alright, 20, 20, 20, 2-0-20.

4012
03:24:22,320 --> 03:24:22,740
20.

4013
03:24:24,640 --> 03:24:25,240
Okay.

4014
03:24:26,020 --> 03:24:27,940
Alright, blue, 20.

4015
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:35,980
Rotate right.

4016
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:40,600
Video games will make you believe you have to traverse sewers almost every day in your life.

4017
03:24:42,480 --> 03:24:44,380
I've only done so once per decade.

4018
03:24:45,360 --> 03:24:47,660
You're not making the most of your life then.

4019
03:24:49,140 --> 03:24:50,020
Who designed this room?

4020
03:24:50,040 --> 03:24:50,740
A screensaver?

4021
03:24:52,140 --> 03:24:53,460
That yellow pipe.

4022
03:24:54,960 --> 03:24:55,940
Okay, 20.

4023
03:24:59,320 --> 03:25:00,480
Alright, wait.

4024
03:25:01,320 --> 03:25:02,140
Alright, we're good.

4025
03:25:02,880 --> 03:25:04,840
For that, I guess.

4026
03:25:05,480 --> 03:25:06,020
Probably.

4027
03:25:06,640 --> 03:25:07,840
There's no instructions.

4028
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:13,280
Alright, do we go to the other rooms then?

4029
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:19,150
Gosh, it's so...

4030
03:25:20,580 --> 03:25:21,160
flashy.

4031
03:25:23,520 --> 03:25:26,300
Are we gonna have other rooms like this as well?

4032
03:25:26,400 --> 03:25:28,140
Where we have to follow the pipe and...

4033
03:25:29,780 --> 03:25:31,740
Gosh, please don't jump out at me.

4034
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:32,220
Please.

4035
03:25:34,960 --> 03:25:37,040
Why is it so dark in here?

4036
03:25:38,180 --> 03:25:38,980
No way.

4037
03:25:39,260 --> 03:25:40,880
Guys, I can't see anything.

4038
03:25:41,620 --> 03:25:42,060
Oh.

4039
03:25:55,680 --> 03:25:56,120
Wow.

4040
03:26:00,920 --> 03:26:01,800
At least...

4041
03:26:03,160 --> 03:26:04,480
they don't discriminate.

4042
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:06,820
They're just like, I wanna look sexy.

4043
03:26:07,100 --> 03:26:10,200
I wanna look sexy as a man, as a woman, it doesn't matter.

4044
03:26:10,380 --> 03:26:11,540
As long as I'm hot.

4045
03:26:13,160 --> 03:26:14,780
Is there anything we can take in here?

4046
03:26:14,780 --> 03:26:16,740
Oh my god, they also have Catty in here.

4047
03:26:17,800 --> 03:26:19,580
She's the hot stuff.

4048
03:26:21,080 --> 03:26:22,180
Okay, so 15?

4049
03:26:26,360 --> 03:26:26,880
15.

4050
03:26:36,200 --> 03:26:38,780
Sorry, I heard like a...

4051
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:40,000
Alright, 15, 15.

4052
03:26:40,840 --> 03:26:42,400
Shirtless dudes also scare me.

4053
03:26:44,720 --> 03:26:47,400
Suddenly became Metal Gear.

4054
03:26:47,620 --> 03:26:49,060
Sorry, I brought up Metal Gear again.

4055
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:49,360
Sorry.

4056
03:26:52,920 --> 03:26:53,440
Sorry.

4057
03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:54,580
Sorry, brain rot.

4058
03:26:54,940 --> 03:26:55,200
Sorry.

4059
03:26:55,560 --> 03:26:56,740
Please excuse my brain rot.

4060
03:26:57,160 --> 03:26:57,880
Rotate right.

4061
03:27:00,260 --> 03:27:00,780
215.

4062
03:27:04,920 --> 03:27:05,440
Okay.

4063
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:07,980
Now we just have a red.

4064
03:27:09,320 --> 03:27:11,440
Which I feel like we could just guess.

4065
03:27:12,140 --> 03:27:14,940
And then something will happen once it's correct, right?

4066
03:27:16,440 --> 03:27:18,200
Do I really have to go?

4067
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:20,800
I feel like we could just guess.

4068
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:24,140
And then whenever I get it correct, something happens.

4069
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:24,720
Right?

4070
03:27:26,260 --> 03:27:27,340
What is Metal Gear?

4071
03:27:27,580 --> 03:27:28,860
What isn't Metal Gear?

4072
03:27:29,440 --> 03:27:31,480
Metal Gear is a state of mind.

4073
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:34,040
Metal Gear is...

4074
03:27:34,720 --> 03:27:35,680
Be careful.

4075
03:27:35,880 --> 03:27:36,280
Be careful.

4076
03:27:39,560 --> 03:27:39,880
No?

4077
03:27:40,720 --> 03:27:40,920
Okay.

4078
03:27:44,160 --> 03:27:45,820
I'm hyping myself up.

4079
03:27:48,540 --> 03:27:49,560
Oh, that's right.

4080
03:27:49,940 --> 03:27:51,040
It was in here.

4081
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:55,040
Yeah, Metal Gear is a way of life.

4082
03:27:56,420 --> 03:27:56,820
Okay,

4083
03:28:02,380 --> 03:28:03,240
it goes up this way.

4084
03:28:04,940 --> 03:28:06,760
So I really didn't need to go in here at all.

4085
03:28:06,920 --> 03:28:09,020
Oh, and then it goes to here.

4086
03:28:10,400 --> 03:28:11,160
Oh, push.

4087
03:28:11,160 --> 03:28:11,200
Push.

4088
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:17,220
Wow, it's the most silent...

4089
03:28:17,780 --> 03:28:18,540
Is it good?

4090
03:28:18,800 --> 03:28:19,440
It's the most...

4091
03:28:19,440 --> 03:28:19,760
Ten!

4092
03:28:20,140 --> 03:28:20,320
Okay.

4093
03:28:21,180 --> 03:28:23,580
It's the most silent locker I've ever heard.

4094
03:28:23,920 --> 03:28:26,480
I've never heard, because I didn't hear a dang thing.

4095
03:28:28,860 --> 03:28:29,980
I just tuned in.

4096
03:28:30,040 --> 03:28:30,920
Is this game scary?

4097
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:33,980
I think it has a good atmosphere.

4098
03:28:35,060 --> 03:28:37,320
And sometimes it has some jump scares, yes.

4099
03:28:38,860 --> 03:28:41,320
But, I don't know, I wouldn't say...

4100
03:28:42,040 --> 03:28:43,560
It's super duper scary.

4101
03:28:44,480 --> 03:28:47,020
Oh god, don't jump out of me from the pool again, please.

4102
03:28:56,070 --> 03:28:57,570
I'm crazier than you.

4103
03:28:58,430 --> 03:29:01,190
I'll literally rip your tongue out with my teeth.

4104
03:29:03,970 --> 03:29:04,490
Okay.

4105
03:29:05,510 --> 03:29:06,850
Alright, ten.

4106
03:29:07,010 --> 03:29:07,650
It was ten.

4107
03:29:11,580 --> 03:29:13,280
Ten, ten, ten, ten.

4108
03:29:17,700 --> 03:29:18,260
Ten.

4109
03:29:23,420 --> 03:29:24,280
Rotate right.

4110
03:29:24,640 --> 03:29:25,080
Ten.

4111
03:29:28,920 --> 03:29:30,840
You've returned water to the hotel.

4112
03:29:31,800 --> 03:29:33,500
There were no instructions.

4113
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:35,220
That guy was so full of shit.

4114
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:38,260
Okay, we're good now?

4115
03:29:41,060 --> 03:29:41,520
I think.

4116
03:29:51,970 --> 03:29:54,450
Oh my god.

4117
03:29:54,570 --> 03:29:55,110
Oh my god!

4118
03:29:57,590 --> 03:29:58,330
Just run.

4119
03:29:58,990 --> 03:29:59,510
I'm running.

4120
03:30:02,980 --> 03:30:04,420
Oh god, not that way.

4121
03:30:04,760 --> 03:30:05,180
Oh my god.

4122
03:30:05,520 --> 03:30:05,880
Run!

4123
03:30:06,260 --> 03:30:06,460
Run!

4124
03:30:06,640 --> 03:30:06,900
Run!

4125
03:30:08,560 --> 03:30:09,100
Run!

4126
03:30:11,460 --> 03:30:11,760
Run!

4127
03:30:12,440 --> 03:30:12,440
Run!

4128
03:30:12,720 --> 03:30:13,880
I have such good stamina.

4129
03:30:14,680 --> 03:30:15,920
Get out of here!

4130
03:30:16,060 --> 03:30:16,740
Oh, not that way.

4131
03:30:18,800 --> 03:30:19,320
Run!

4132
03:30:22,820 --> 03:30:24,260
Maybe into that vent?

4133
03:30:24,640 --> 03:30:24,920
Okay.

4134
03:30:28,500 --> 03:30:29,020
Climb!

4135
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:29,540
Climb!

4136
03:30:30,080 --> 03:30:31,260
Climb, climb, climb, please.

4137
03:30:32,080 --> 03:30:32,500
Oh my god.

4138
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:34,580
Good thing this thing is so slow.

4139
03:30:41,860 --> 03:30:43,280
I think we better get out of here.

4140
03:30:44,120 --> 03:30:45,480
Sounds like an actual T-Rex.

4141
03:30:49,480 --> 03:30:50,320
I think...

4142
03:30:51,380 --> 03:30:52,960
Do I have to avoid that thing again?

4143
03:30:55,980 --> 03:30:57,660
Goth GF, where did you go?

4144
03:31:03,760 --> 03:31:04,980
Where do I go?

4145
03:31:05,280 --> 03:31:06,760
I think I just messed up you guys.

4146
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:15,880
I think I should have run through the other door.

4147
03:31:16,240 --> 03:31:16,920
That's my bad.

4148
03:31:21,300 --> 03:31:24,320
Find and rescue the diaper chief, Donald Anderson.

4149
03:31:29,150 --> 03:31:31,010
You slapped me to death for real.

4150
03:31:33,050 --> 03:31:33,430
Okay.

4151
03:31:36,010 --> 03:31:37,230
Wait, the door is open.

4152
03:31:40,250 --> 03:31:41,090
I'm running.

4153
03:31:41,510 --> 03:31:41,910
I'm running.

4154
03:31:42,130 --> 03:31:43,410
I'm running, running, running.

4155
03:31:43,690 --> 03:31:44,470
I'm running.

4156
03:31:44,730 --> 03:31:45,250
I'm running.

4157
03:31:45,450 --> 03:31:46,850
I'm running, running, running.

4158
03:31:47,230 --> 03:31:47,930
I'm running.

4159
03:31:48,190 --> 03:31:48,730
I'm running.

4160
03:31:49,070 --> 03:31:50,470
I'm running, running, running.

4161
03:31:50,470 --> 03:31:52,470
I'm running, I'm running.

4162
03:31:52,870 --> 03:31:54,390
I'm getting out of here.

4163
03:31:55,190 --> 03:31:56,330
She could have just kept going.

4164
03:31:56,470 --> 03:31:59,170
I think the door glitched out.

4165
03:32:00,770 --> 03:32:01,590
The glore.

4166
03:32:02,110 --> 03:32:03,510
What's wrong with me?

4167
03:32:04,950 --> 03:32:07,730
It's just me combining words again you guys.

4168
03:32:10,110 --> 03:32:10,970
Oh god.

4169
03:32:11,070 --> 03:32:11,610
Climb, climb, climb.

4170
03:32:15,920 --> 03:32:16,580
Okay.

4171
03:32:23,650 --> 03:32:25,590
Our little brisk jog.

4172
03:32:26,930 --> 03:32:29,710
So I guess we go to the...

4173
03:32:31,130 --> 03:32:32,850
It does let me run.

4174
03:32:33,370 --> 03:32:34,190
We go to here.

4175
03:32:37,050 --> 03:32:37,910
Oh my god.

4176
03:32:38,190 --> 03:32:38,930
Okay, not that way.

4177
03:32:39,650 --> 03:32:41,490
Okay, now we are avoiding electricity.

4178
03:32:42,210 --> 03:32:42,890
Love that.

4179
03:32:44,470 --> 03:32:46,770
Can't we lure him into the electricity?

4180
03:32:50,450 --> 03:32:52,850
I don't feel like I'm running fast enough.

4181
03:32:53,430 --> 03:32:57,050
I really don't feel like I'm running fast enough for this guy.

4182
03:32:58,130 --> 03:32:59,090
Hi, dag!

4183
03:33:00,550 --> 03:33:01,110
Oh my god.

4184
03:33:01,250 --> 03:33:01,810
Into here?

4185
03:33:15,860 --> 03:33:18,100
Your brain works faster than your mouth.

4186
03:33:19,020 --> 03:33:19,500
Damn!

4187
03:33:22,420 --> 03:33:23,600
Oh my god.

4188
03:33:25,700 --> 03:33:26,440
How do you feel?

4189
03:33:26,820 --> 03:33:28,200
Feel nice and safe in there?

4190
03:33:30,680 --> 03:33:32,400
Yeah, I bet you did.

4191
03:33:32,520 --> 03:33:33,540
Yeah, I bet you did.

4192
03:33:41,700 --> 03:33:42,380
I'm fine.

4193
03:33:45,620 --> 03:33:46,360
Who was it?

4194
03:33:46,680 --> 03:33:47,660
How did you end up here?

4195
03:33:47,900 --> 03:33:48,780
I'm fine, thank you.

4196
03:33:48,980 --> 03:33:49,760
How are you?

4197
03:33:53,800 --> 03:33:57,680
We are trying to be nice to her, so let's ask if she's okay.

4198
03:33:57,780 --> 03:33:58,160
Are you alright?

4199
03:34:00,760 --> 03:34:01,960
Do you need a hug?

4200
03:34:02,260 --> 03:34:02,720
Are you okay?

4201
03:34:06,700 --> 03:34:08,480
Yeah, I wonder what caused that.

4202
03:34:11,420 --> 03:34:14,600
Okay, let's go together.

4203
03:34:16,260 --> 03:34:16,960
Oh good.

4204
03:34:17,520 --> 03:34:18,780
It's really red.

4205
03:34:22,100 --> 03:34:23,680
Oh my god, we are right here.

4206
03:34:24,060 --> 03:34:24,760
That's kind of awesome.

4207
03:34:26,140 --> 03:34:27,300
It's like I'm at home again.

4208
03:34:28,880 --> 03:34:30,140
Yeah, you can take a shower.

4209
03:34:34,320 --> 03:34:34,840
Okay.

4210
03:34:38,840 --> 03:34:39,360
Hello?

4211
03:34:39,360 --> 03:34:39,420
Hello?

4212
03:34:47,640 --> 03:34:49,540
Was it you who cut the power?

4213
03:34:53,140 --> 03:34:54,420
I was attacked.

4214
03:34:54,520 --> 03:34:55,720
I had no other choice.

4215
03:34:57,340 --> 03:34:59,560
You destroyed our only link to the outside world.

4216
03:34:59,680 --> 03:35:00,680
I hope it was worth it.

4217
03:35:00,960 --> 03:35:02,560
This guy is such a jerk!

4218
03:35:04,320 --> 03:35:06,220
Do I have to end the world for Goth GF?

4219
03:35:06,280 --> 03:35:07,260
Is that the requirement?

4220
03:35:08,520 --> 03:35:10,020
I think it will help.

4221
03:35:11,380 --> 03:35:13,120
I was close to...

4222
03:35:13,800 --> 03:35:14,240
Sorry.

4223
03:35:14,480 --> 03:35:17,440
I was close to getting a signal out, but now everything is gone haywire.

4224
03:35:18,560 --> 03:35:19,160
Alright kid.

4225
03:35:19,560 --> 03:35:22,300
I need to check the manual and see if it can be fixed.

4226
03:35:22,820 --> 03:35:23,540
Head back to your room.

4227
03:35:23,680 --> 03:35:24,920
The corridors aren't safe right now.

4228
03:35:25,000 --> 03:35:26,860
My cameras are no longer working.

4229
03:35:27,900 --> 03:35:28,560
See you soon.

4230
03:35:30,580 --> 03:35:31,080
Oh good.

4231
03:35:33,780 --> 03:35:34,680
Is that us sleeping?

4232
03:35:34,680 --> 03:35:36,400
And save!

4233
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:37,940
Oh no!

4234
03:35:39,140 --> 03:35:42,140
Our dreams are getting really more vivid now.

4235
03:35:44,460 --> 03:35:46,180
They're getting really bright.

4236
03:35:46,580 --> 03:35:47,860
Wait, which way do I go?

4237
03:35:50,920 --> 03:35:51,860
This way?

4238
03:35:52,260 --> 03:35:53,620
What if I go this way?

4239
03:35:55,100 --> 03:35:56,120
Good luck everyone else.

4240
03:35:58,040 --> 03:35:59,260
4K dreaming.

4241
03:36:00,480 --> 03:36:03,760
The ocean is getting so bright and vivid now.

4242
03:36:03,760 --> 03:36:05,320
Am I going the right way?

4243
03:36:05,480 --> 03:36:05,980
Does it matter?

4244
03:36:06,280 --> 03:36:07,000
Oh, ok.

4245
03:36:07,220 --> 03:36:08,300
I hit the invisible wall.

4246
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:12,880
Yeah, we dream in Subnautica.

4247
03:36:14,400 --> 03:36:15,540
It's because we're a gamer.

4248
03:36:15,940 --> 03:36:18,400
We dream in video games and everything.

4249
03:36:25,460 --> 03:36:25,900
Nice.

4250
03:36:28,460 --> 03:36:29,900
Where is our...

4251
03:36:30,660 --> 03:36:32,360
Where is our space lady?

4252
03:36:32,440 --> 03:36:33,080
There she is.

4253
03:36:33,080 --> 03:36:34,800
Hello space lady!

4254
03:36:35,240 --> 03:36:36,120
What is that?

4255
03:36:37,940 --> 03:36:41,080
Oh, it's a giant...

4256
03:36:46,200 --> 03:36:48,020
It's a giant spout.

4257
03:36:48,640 --> 03:36:49,900
Our cosmic GF.

4258
03:36:50,700 --> 03:36:55,000
She's like watching us as we run around like a little kid in a candy store.

4259
03:36:57,400 --> 03:36:58,120
Hello!

4260
03:36:59,200 --> 03:36:59,720
Hello!

4261
03:37:02,880 --> 03:37:03,920
You tried to help them.

4262
03:37:04,240 --> 03:37:05,000
You almost died.

4263
03:37:05,180 --> 03:37:06,000
And what in the end?

4264
03:37:06,320 --> 03:37:07,960
Everything only got worse.

4265
03:37:08,100 --> 03:37:09,620
And they treated you like crap.

4266
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:10,420
You know what?

4267
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:12,480
That is true.

4268
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:14,980
I, I, I...

4269
03:37:14,980 --> 03:37:17,420
Well, not Robin.

4270
03:37:17,620 --> 03:37:18,340
She was nice.

4271
03:37:18,800 --> 03:37:20,800
But the guy is such a jerk.

4272
03:37:24,100 --> 03:37:24,540
Oh.

4273
03:37:26,580 --> 03:37:27,420
Stay silent.

4274
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:29,560
I brought back the water to help myself, not them.

4275
03:37:29,780 --> 03:37:31,300
You're exaggerating their reaction.

4276
03:37:31,900 --> 03:37:33,140
They owe me for this.

4277
03:37:33,580 --> 03:37:34,940
Is this even the same game?

4278
03:37:38,020 --> 03:37:40,060
What if I just stay silent?

4279
03:37:41,480 --> 03:37:41,920
I wonder.

4280
03:37:42,060 --> 03:37:44,260
I feel like it goes from like...

4281
03:37:44,260 --> 03:37:47,020
From like agreement to disagreement, you know.

4282
03:37:47,200 --> 03:37:48,480
Or actually, I don't think so.

4283
03:37:48,580 --> 03:37:50,200
They owe me for this is not really disagreeing.

4284
03:37:50,900 --> 03:37:55,180
I think 3 is probably the most anti-space GF.

4285
03:37:57,840 --> 03:38:00,520
So you risk your life for them and they paid you with nagging?

4286
03:38:00,980 --> 03:38:01,540
Of course.

4287
03:38:01,640 --> 03:38:02,720
That's much better.

4288
03:38:04,480 --> 03:38:08,180
Before you know it, you and only you will have to solve their problems again.

4289
03:38:09,220 --> 03:38:11,220
I have a feeling she's not wrong.

4290
03:38:13,240 --> 03:38:15,800
They can rely on you, but you can't rely on them.

4291
03:38:18,580 --> 03:38:19,780
Robin is helping me.

4292
03:38:19,820 --> 03:38:21,740
The watcher is trying to contact the rescuers.

4293
03:38:21,980 --> 03:38:23,240
The priest is hunting monsters.

4294
03:38:23,320 --> 03:38:24,580
We're including the priest?

4295
03:38:30,320 --> 03:38:31,740
He's part of our entourage?

4296
03:38:32,320 --> 03:38:33,840
He doesn't even go here.

4297
03:38:35,080 --> 03:38:36,740
I have to trust someone.

4298
03:38:37,020 --> 03:38:38,760
I think we can say Robin is helping me.

4299
03:38:39,240 --> 03:38:40,120
She came with.

4300
03:38:40,660 --> 03:38:42,360
I mean, it's not her fault.

4301
03:38:42,500 --> 03:38:44,480
She probably just stumbled upon that monster.

4302
03:38:44,480 --> 03:38:47,480
Robin is helping me.

4303
03:38:48,620 --> 03:38:50,740
She's with you only because you protect her.

4304
03:38:51,060 --> 03:38:53,300
She's a thief and you've already realized that.

4305
03:38:53,380 --> 03:38:53,500
What?

4306
03:38:54,600 --> 03:38:55,360
A thief?

4307
03:38:56,180 --> 03:38:58,940
You know that she's hiding something even more dangerous.

4308
03:39:04,340 --> 03:39:06,180
Where did we get thief from?

4309
03:39:08,240 --> 03:39:11,680
They will betray you if you rely on them, as it was then.

4310
03:39:12,780 --> 03:39:14,300
Yeah, she stole my heart.

4311
03:39:18,860 --> 03:39:20,440
You will be alone again.

4312
03:39:20,780 --> 03:39:21,100
Broken.

4313
03:39:22,180 --> 03:39:24,040
Then you will remember why you came here.

4314
03:39:24,940 --> 03:39:28,000
I don't want this, but maybe it's worth reminding what it's like.

4315
03:39:28,240 --> 03:39:29,120
Wait, what do you mean by that?

4316
03:39:31,800 --> 03:39:32,980
Open the valve.

4317
03:39:34,780 --> 03:39:35,260
Opening?

4318
03:39:43,960 --> 03:39:45,820
We have rusty pipes.

4319
03:39:47,480 --> 03:39:49,560
Wait, it's going to overflow I think.

4320
03:39:50,740 --> 03:39:51,660
Ma'am?

4321
03:39:51,980 --> 03:39:53,880
Ma'am, stop the valve.

4322
03:40:06,540 --> 03:40:07,900
Are we OK?

4323
03:40:10,060 --> 03:40:11,120
Day 8.

4324
03:40:11,920 --> 03:40:12,840
Did we get another achievement?

4325
03:40:13,040 --> 03:40:13,180
Yup.

4326
03:40:16,360 --> 03:40:17,780
Survive until the 8th day.

4327
03:40:17,880 --> 03:40:18,880
Wait, we are in the bed.

4328
03:40:23,560 --> 03:40:24,360
The bathroom?

4329
03:40:24,640 --> 03:40:26,500
Wait, we slept in the bed actually.

4330
03:40:27,920 --> 03:40:30,360
Uh oh, it doesn't look so good out there you guys.

4331
03:40:30,880 --> 03:40:32,180
Wait, she's in the bathroom?

4332
03:40:35,940 --> 03:40:36,340
Guys...

4333
03:40:38,510 --> 03:40:39,770
OK, I'm checking my breath.

4334
03:40:41,950 --> 03:40:42,890
I'm checking my hair.

4335
03:40:43,210 --> 03:40:43,810
Do I look OK?

4336
03:40:44,830 --> 03:40:45,150
OK.

4337
03:40:59,060 --> 03:41:02,520
Oh my gosh, I also like to shower like a monkey.

4338
03:41:04,660 --> 03:41:06,000
She's scratching her head.

4339
03:41:10,440 --> 03:41:12,340
See, I told you we should have gone to that...

4340
03:41:12,340 --> 03:41:14,400
Remember that guy that stole all the soap?

4341
03:41:14,460 --> 03:41:15,500
We should have grabbed his stuff.

4342
03:41:17,660 --> 03:41:18,420
You're welcome.

4343
03:41:23,720 --> 03:41:25,850
I may not believe it, but when we were kids...

4344
03:41:26,320 --> 03:41:29,360
we didn't have a shower or even running water inside our house.

4345
03:41:29,500 --> 03:41:31,040
Oh my god, no shower?

4346
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:33,640
We should have soaked back.

4347
03:41:34,240 --> 03:41:37,700
At least, that's what my parents would definitely say.

4348
03:41:39,080 --> 03:41:42,680
I mean, if you take like a 30 minute shower, yeah, probably.

4349
03:41:43,940 --> 03:41:48,100
But I think that sometimes small joys can give us strength to face something big.

4350
03:41:49,580 --> 03:41:50,960
Could you pass us the coat?

4351
03:41:51,140 --> 03:41:51,520
Thanks.

4352
03:41:51,640 --> 03:41:52,640
Oh yeah, sure, I got you.

4353
03:41:52,640 --> 03:41:53,580
There you go.

4354
03:41:54,420 --> 03:41:55,040
I don't need it.

4355
03:41:55,460 --> 03:41:56,220
I never cope.

4356
03:41:58,140 --> 03:41:59,900
Do you want to take a shower?

4357
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:03,240
You know, it's a great stress reliever.

4358
03:42:15,550 --> 03:42:17,210
Of course, why not?

4359
03:42:17,310 --> 03:42:17,890
Good thinking.

4360
03:42:18,230 --> 03:42:19,110
You'll like it.

4361
03:42:20,090 --> 03:42:21,570
Just wait until I'm done.

4362
03:42:21,850 --> 03:42:22,870
I'm almost there.

4363
03:42:24,470 --> 03:42:24,970
Right.

4364
03:42:26,190 --> 03:42:27,790
What's that thing?

4365
03:42:28,290 --> 03:42:30,150
Save water...

4366
03:42:30,150 --> 03:42:34,430
Save a dolphin, ride a cowboy.

4367
03:42:34,950 --> 03:42:37,990
Save water, shower with me.

4368
03:42:38,210 --> 03:42:39,110
Wait, what is it?

4369
03:42:45,050 --> 03:42:47,430
Save water, ride a cowgirl?

4370
03:42:51,760 --> 03:42:54,440
Am I getting the saying right?

4371
03:42:58,420 --> 03:42:59,520
Use the gum.

4372
03:42:59,700 --> 03:43:01,280
Yeah, I need to use the gum.

4373
03:43:04,360 --> 03:43:05,280
She hates us.

4374
03:43:08,360 --> 03:43:09,840
What are you talking about, Robin?

4375
03:43:09,920 --> 03:43:11,700
We've been together for 8 days.

4376
03:43:11,900 --> 03:43:16,320
We've been together for just a little bit over a week and you haven't fallen in love with me?

4377
03:43:16,820 --> 03:43:18,400
We haven't trauma bonded enough?

4378
03:43:21,860 --> 03:43:23,840
It's been 8 days and you're not gonna propose?

4379
03:43:29,210 --> 03:43:30,010
Developer...

4380
03:43:30,010 --> 03:43:33,010
Developer, you sneaky...

4381
03:43:33,010 --> 03:43:34,490
Sneaky bastard, you.

4382
03:43:39,170 --> 03:43:40,530
She's getting dressed.

4383
03:43:41,050 --> 03:43:41,890
Wow, that was fast.

4384
03:43:43,870 --> 03:43:46,050
Thank you, I will.

4385
03:43:54,200 --> 03:43:56,680
I like how...

4386
03:43:56,680 --> 03:43:59,260
We have the candle in the shower.

4387
03:43:59,500 --> 03:44:01,020
Actually, how did that stay lit?

4388
03:44:01,500 --> 03:44:02,620
Now that I think about it.

4389
03:44:03,260 --> 03:44:04,180
She's so cute.

4390
03:44:05,080 --> 03:44:06,180
Turn off please.

4391
03:44:06,580 --> 03:44:07,620
Don't turn it back on.

4392
03:44:07,700 --> 03:44:09,360
Oh my god, she is so cute!

4393
03:44:10,060 --> 03:44:11,220
Gosh, look at her!

4394
03:44:11,340 --> 03:44:13,800
Oh my gosh, her face is probably so cute.

4395
03:44:14,420 --> 03:44:15,640
Okay, excuse me!

4396
03:44:15,800 --> 03:44:16,240
Pick up!

4397
03:44:16,300 --> 03:44:16,480
Hello!

4398
03:44:18,560 --> 03:44:19,400
It's me.

4399
03:44:20,180 --> 03:44:21,320
Who is me?

4400
03:44:21,780 --> 03:44:23,300
Your pal, the Watcher.

4401
03:44:23,360 --> 03:44:24,580
Who else would be calling you?

4402
03:44:24,580 --> 03:44:27,160
Hey, you're snarky with me all the time.

4403
03:44:27,200 --> 03:44:28,420
I can be snarky with you.

4404
03:44:30,240 --> 03:44:31,380
She's out of our league.

4405
03:44:31,480 --> 03:44:32,200
No, no, no.

4406
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:33,620
We got this.

4407
03:44:33,660 --> 03:44:34,860
We're probably so handsome.

4408
03:44:36,440 --> 03:44:37,560
I figured out the issue.

4409
03:44:37,680 --> 03:44:39,260
The emergency generator has shut off.

4410
03:44:39,340 --> 03:44:40,540
It needs to be restarted.

4411
03:44:41,900 --> 03:44:45,420
It's located underground, but to reach it you'll have to go through the parking lot.

4412
03:44:47,240 --> 03:44:48,660
But why can't you?

4413
03:44:49,340 --> 03:44:50,780
And no, I can't do this myself.

4414
03:44:50,840 --> 03:44:51,560
Don't even ask.

4415
03:44:51,600 --> 03:44:53,060
This guy is such a jerk.

4416
03:44:53,680 --> 03:44:58,540
I know we know the reason why now, but just communicate that to us.

4417
03:45:02,190 --> 03:45:05,710
Like, he doesn't know that we read that note.

4418
03:45:06,150 --> 03:45:06,530
You know?

4419
03:45:08,390 --> 03:45:10,650
I'm nearly done setting up the radio transmitter.

4420
03:45:10,910 --> 03:45:11,950
I need to finish this.

4421
03:45:14,410 --> 03:45:15,110
Head down to me.

4422
03:45:15,230 --> 03:45:16,810
I'll pass you the keys to the parking lot.

4423
03:45:17,350 --> 03:45:18,210
See you soon, kid.

4424
03:45:20,050 --> 03:45:20,490
Okay.

4425
03:45:20,810 --> 03:45:22,410
Go without me.

4426
03:45:22,630 --> 03:45:23,650
I need to do something.

4427
03:45:25,790 --> 03:45:27,010
Uh, what are you up to?

4428
03:45:27,430 --> 03:45:28,210
I can't say.

4429
03:45:28,450 --> 03:45:29,450
You'll find out later.

4430
03:45:30,910 --> 03:45:32,550
I'll see you later, okay?

4431
03:45:34,690 --> 03:45:35,070
Uh...

4432
03:45:36,410 --> 03:45:37,230
Hey, Robin.

4433
03:45:38,210 --> 03:45:40,490
This might be a bad time to bring this up, but I'm infected.

4434
03:45:40,970 --> 03:45:45,350
And, you know, I told the voices inside my head that you were the only one helping me out.

4435
03:45:45,450 --> 03:45:51,230
And, like, you know, it's kind of putting off the infection from, like, spreading any further.

4436
03:45:51,230 --> 03:45:56,750
But you're really not helping my case if you just, like, don't... if you don't help me out.

4437
03:45:56,790 --> 03:46:01,390
Because I literally, in my dreams, was like, oh, Robin is the only one I can depend on.

4438
03:46:01,810 --> 03:46:03,770
And you're just really throwing that case away.

4439
03:46:03,810 --> 03:46:04,350
I'm just saying.

4440
03:46:05,490 --> 03:46:06,210
Good luck.

4441
03:46:06,990 --> 03:46:07,610
Oh my god.

4442
03:46:07,710 --> 03:46:08,030
Okay.

4443
03:46:08,190 --> 03:46:08,690
Thank you.

4444
03:46:12,930 --> 03:46:14,610
You're really not gonna come with?

4445
03:46:16,550 --> 03:46:18,510
How much food do we have left, even?

4446
03:46:19,010 --> 03:46:21,750
We definitely did not have seven days worth of food.

4447
03:46:25,430 --> 03:46:25,950
Alright.

4448
03:46:26,310 --> 03:46:27,170
Wipes your eyes.

4449
03:46:27,330 --> 03:46:28,930
I'm, like, sobbing.

4450
03:46:29,010 --> 03:46:29,610
I'm crying.

4451
03:46:29,790 --> 03:46:31,550
And she's like, wipes your tears away.

4452
03:46:34,050 --> 03:46:34,950
Good luck.

4453
03:46:35,070 --> 03:46:36,090
Wipes off your face.

4454
03:46:36,210 --> 03:46:36,970
Oh my god.

4455
03:46:37,590 --> 03:46:39,310
Robin, it's really dark out here.

4456
03:46:39,970 --> 03:46:40,350
Robin.

4457
03:46:41,430 --> 03:46:43,350
I think it would be good if we quit together.

4458
03:46:43,870 --> 03:46:44,930
As a team.

4459
03:46:54,550 --> 03:46:55,490
What is that?

4460
03:46:56,650 --> 03:46:57,550
Who's laughing?

4461
03:47:03,300 --> 03:47:05,920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

4462
03:47:07,240 --> 03:47:08,580
This is so bad.

4463
03:47:09,340 --> 03:47:10,260
In here?

4464
03:47:12,080 --> 03:47:12,720
Yep.

4465
03:47:12,860 --> 03:47:13,960
Oh my god, it's the white lady.

4466
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:16,580
Gosh.

4467
03:47:17,760 --> 03:47:18,240
You.

4468
03:47:19,600 --> 03:47:20,840
Hi, white lady.

4469
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:24,000
Come here.

4470
03:47:24,920 --> 03:47:25,560
Okay.

4471
03:47:26,320 --> 03:47:26,860
Gosh.

4472
03:47:28,160 --> 03:47:29,300
She's so demanding.

4473
03:47:29,400 --> 03:47:30,120
I kind of love her.

4474
03:47:33,300 --> 03:47:34,560
You covered him up.

4475
03:47:35,200 --> 03:47:35,840
Hello.

4476
03:47:37,960 --> 03:47:39,380
I saw you with her.

4477
03:47:46,000 --> 03:47:47,280
Young, beautiful.

4478
03:47:49,340 --> 03:47:50,900
You went to buy tickets.

4479
03:47:51,420 --> 03:47:52,880
She's still hallucinating.

4480
03:47:54,080 --> 03:47:54,720
You...

4481
03:47:54,720 --> 03:47:56,140
Are you breaking up with me?

4482
03:47:56,920 --> 03:47:59,180
She's remembering the moment when her husband left.

4483
03:47:59,180 --> 03:48:04,020
If I don't direct this fantasy of hers, everything could end very badly.

4484
03:48:06,480 --> 03:48:07,580
Please snap out of it.

4485
03:48:07,620 --> 03:48:08,360
I'm not your husband.

4486
03:48:09,080 --> 03:48:11,120
These are tickets to a resort.

4487
03:48:11,240 --> 03:48:12,880
I was preparing a surprise for you.

4488
03:48:13,340 --> 03:48:14,540
I have to go on a business trip.

4489
03:48:14,640 --> 03:48:15,680
Okay, definitely not that one.

4490
03:48:16,020 --> 03:48:16,680
You're mistaken.

4491
03:48:16,840 --> 03:48:17,780
It wasn't me.

4492
03:48:21,660 --> 03:48:24,160
I'm either to two or four.

4493
03:48:28,890 --> 03:48:29,850
One or four?

4494
03:48:31,610 --> 03:48:33,070
Like, do we play along with it?

4495
03:48:33,110 --> 03:48:34,350
Or do we be like, girl...

4496
03:48:35,510 --> 03:48:37,630
Girl, you out your mind.

4497
03:48:40,190 --> 03:48:41,790
What would Raiden pick?

4498
03:48:42,550 --> 03:48:43,050
Four.

4499
03:48:48,490 --> 03:48:49,530
Of course.

4500
03:48:49,670 --> 03:48:51,190
Like, I'm supposed to believe that.

4501
03:48:51,290 --> 03:48:53,690
Okay, Raiden, definitely, this would happen.

4502
03:48:54,830 --> 03:48:55,710
Who is she?

4503
03:48:55,890 --> 03:48:56,810
That girl you were with.

4504
03:48:57,390 --> 03:49:00,510
Blonde hair, pink dress, car, Barbie?

4505
03:49:01,610 --> 03:49:02,570
Oh my gosh.

4506
03:49:03,550 --> 03:49:06,210
No, black hair, black t-shirt, hotel.

4507
03:49:07,310 --> 03:49:07,770
Or...

4508
03:49:08,410 --> 03:49:09,630
She's starting to mix them up.

4509
03:49:09,750 --> 03:49:11,070
It seems her mind is starting to clear.

4510
03:49:11,810 --> 03:49:12,330
No, no, no.

4511
03:49:12,690 --> 03:49:13,270
Who are you with?

4512
03:49:13,350 --> 03:49:13,790
Tell me!

4513
03:49:15,390 --> 03:49:18,350
I was just giving my sister a ride.

4514
03:49:19,350 --> 03:49:21,770
A colleague from work was helping me.

4515
03:49:22,330 --> 03:49:22,790
Spendgum.

4516
03:49:23,090 --> 03:49:26,190
Why look for fake stones when a real diamond is waiting at home?

4517
03:49:27,750 --> 03:49:29,170
How do these work on her?

4518
03:49:29,170 --> 03:49:32,570
They were different people you saw at different times.

4519
03:49:33,050 --> 03:49:34,110
There was no girl.

4520
03:49:37,530 --> 03:49:38,490
Maybe this?

4521
03:49:38,590 --> 03:49:40,530
Because her mind is starting to clear, right?

4522
03:49:41,690 --> 03:49:44,290
There were different people you saw at different times.

4523
03:49:45,610 --> 03:49:49,430
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed creeping with the girl next door.

4524
03:49:52,070 --> 03:49:53,190
Oh, see, that worked.

4525
03:49:53,370 --> 03:49:54,330
Different times.

4526
03:49:55,870 --> 03:49:56,970
Oh, she's confused.

4527
03:49:57,110 --> 03:49:57,530
Oh my god.

4528
03:49:58,450 --> 03:49:59,490
It worked!

4529
03:49:59,710 --> 03:50:00,270
Oh my god.

4530
03:50:00,950 --> 03:50:01,870
Blonde in the car.

4531
03:50:02,970 --> 03:50:03,490
Or...

4532
03:50:03,490 --> 03:50:04,650
Girl at the hotel.

4533
03:50:05,490 --> 03:50:05,870
Hotel.

4534
03:50:07,790 --> 03:50:09,510
I didn't come here alone.

4535
03:50:10,550 --> 03:50:12,030
Oh, she's starting to really realize.

4536
03:50:12,850 --> 03:50:14,810
A guy whose name I don't remember.

4537
03:50:15,950 --> 03:50:17,430
I took him away from his family.

4538
03:50:17,910 --> 03:50:19,510
Like she took you away from me.

4539
03:50:19,830 --> 03:50:21,630
Yeah, because he was married.

4540
03:50:22,130 --> 03:50:23,890
He's a scumbag though, don't worry.

4541
03:50:24,190 --> 03:50:25,590
He chose this room.

4542
03:50:25,790 --> 03:50:26,410
Our room.

4543
03:50:26,410 --> 03:50:28,390
And he didn't even know about it.

4544
03:50:28,670 --> 03:50:30,170
This is one weird dating sim, right?

4545
03:50:31,010 --> 03:50:33,730
I kind of want like a horror dating sim now.

4546
03:50:33,810 --> 03:50:34,790
It's kind of awesome.

4547
03:50:36,530 --> 03:50:37,650
A horndog.

4548
03:50:37,890 --> 03:50:39,290
Like all of them.

4549
03:50:41,190 --> 03:50:43,410
You ain't nothing but a horndog.

4550
03:50:44,010 --> 03:50:45,270
Crying all the time.

4551
03:50:45,650 --> 03:50:46,370
Wasn't mint.

4552
03:50:46,970 --> 03:50:47,650
No, it wasn't me.

4553
03:50:48,330 --> 03:50:50,310
The shadows in the corners are getting stronger.

4554
03:50:50,690 --> 03:50:52,070
I barely remember myself.

4555
03:50:53,030 --> 03:50:53,970
Was it me?

4556
03:50:54,450 --> 03:50:55,110
Who killed him?

4557
03:50:57,310 --> 03:50:59,850
Do I lay this upon her?

4558
03:51:00,030 --> 03:51:01,270
Yes, no, I don't know.

4559
03:51:01,630 --> 03:51:03,310
I mean, I guess we...

4560
03:51:03,310 --> 03:51:04,630
It's probably her, right?

4561
03:51:13,190 --> 03:51:14,050
Be honest?

4562
03:51:14,770 --> 03:51:17,210
Yes, I knew it.

4563
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:19,950
The voice suggested it and I did it.

4564
03:51:20,730 --> 03:51:22,270
And it felt good.

4565
03:51:23,670 --> 03:51:26,250
I close my eyes and I see myself beside him.

4566
03:51:28,390 --> 03:51:30,490
We're laughing, dancing.

4567
03:51:30,490 --> 03:51:32,650
You're taking game suggestions.

4568
03:51:33,370 --> 03:51:33,750
Am I?

4569
03:51:34,490 --> 03:51:35,410
Right now?

4570
03:51:38,250 --> 03:51:40,170
It's a caveman ghost world.

4571
03:51:40,370 --> 03:51:40,970
Interesting.

4572
03:51:42,270 --> 03:51:44,130
Sucker for love is a lovecraft dating sim.

4573
03:51:44,230 --> 03:51:44,830
Oh, true?

4574
03:51:46,450 --> 03:51:48,130
But I want something a little more...

4575
03:51:48,130 --> 03:51:49,770
I want something a little more freaky.

4576
03:51:50,710 --> 03:51:51,250
Scary.

4577
03:51:52,850 --> 03:51:55,410
He's leading me and I let him lead.

4578
03:51:57,190 --> 03:51:58,150
The shadow.

4579
03:51:58,530 --> 03:52:00,410
If she told me what to do...

4580
03:52:01,010 --> 03:52:01,690
Who's at fault?

4581
03:52:02,110 --> 03:52:03,130
Me or her?

4582
03:52:05,190 --> 03:52:07,250
People died because of your weakness.

4583
03:52:07,770 --> 03:52:08,650
It's not your fault.

4584
03:52:08,790 --> 03:52:10,890
Someone's using you or something's using you.

4585
03:52:11,550 --> 03:52:13,390
It's up to you to decide.

4586
03:52:14,370 --> 03:52:16,910
Yeah, Slay the Princess is very much like that.

4587
03:52:21,820 --> 03:52:22,320
Three?

4588
03:52:23,640 --> 03:52:24,260
Let's do three.

4589
03:52:25,360 --> 03:52:26,780
It's hard to decide.

4590
03:52:28,040 --> 03:52:28,720
Is he to blame?

4591
03:52:29,040 --> 03:52:29,460
Am I?

4592
03:52:29,660 --> 03:52:30,140
Or is she?

4593
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:32,880
Are we all in... She?

4594
03:52:36,560 --> 03:52:38,300
Is her voice also a lady?

4595
03:52:42,550 --> 03:52:44,450
Or is she talking about the other woman?

4596
03:52:47,630 --> 03:52:49,770
Yeah, is she also seeing the cosmic GF?

4597
03:52:50,310 --> 03:52:51,930
Or are we all...

4598
03:52:51,930 --> 03:52:53,570
Are we all in this together?

4599
03:52:53,710 --> 03:52:56,210
We're all in this together.

4600
03:52:57,070 --> 03:52:59,150
The voice whispers not only to me.

4601
03:52:59,450 --> 03:53:00,590
You hear it too, don't you?

4602
03:53:01,370 --> 03:53:02,890
It pretended to be my husband.

4603
03:53:04,390 --> 03:53:06,510
It will give you what you're looking for.

4604
03:53:06,790 --> 03:53:09,090
I think mine is pretending to be my mom then.

4605
03:53:12,230 --> 03:53:12,750
Scarisol.

4606
03:53:13,250 --> 03:53:14,250
Horror dating sim.

4607
03:53:14,510 --> 03:53:16,250
Not a dating sim for horror monsters.

4608
03:53:17,030 --> 03:53:19,330
Yeah, the bot fanbook makes sense.

4609
03:53:22,450 --> 03:53:24,170
It will become a part of you.

4610
03:53:26,430 --> 03:53:26,910
Go.

4611
03:53:27,610 --> 03:53:29,450
I kind of like the white lady so much.

4612
03:53:31,130 --> 03:53:32,590
I won't see you again.

4613
03:53:33,470 --> 03:53:34,510
No, white lady!

4614
03:53:35,810 --> 03:53:36,910
I got an achievement.

4615
03:53:37,070 --> 03:53:38,910
You said goodbye to the white lady.

4616
03:53:41,410 --> 03:53:42,850
I can kind of see her face.

4617
03:53:43,670 --> 03:53:44,510
She's beautiful.

4618
03:53:44,910 --> 03:53:45,650
White lady!

4619
03:53:49,410 --> 03:53:51,150
I'll catch you on the flip side.

4620
03:53:52,770 --> 03:53:53,790
It's so tragic.

4621
03:53:53,990 --> 03:53:54,410
I know.

4622
03:53:58,560 --> 03:54:00,100
I'm gonna miss her.

4623
03:54:01,020 --> 03:54:01,840
God.

4624
03:54:02,880 --> 03:54:04,280
Red means scary.

4625
03:54:04,780 --> 03:54:05,840
It's so red.

4626
03:54:07,100 --> 03:54:08,300
Don't go, white lady.

4627
03:54:08,620 --> 03:54:09,420
Don't go.

4628
03:54:11,340 --> 03:54:13,980
Our fishy dreams are...

4629
03:54:17,390 --> 03:54:18,670
Oh my god.

4630
03:54:19,830 --> 03:54:21,350
It's getting so freaky here.

4631
03:54:23,250 --> 03:54:23,810
Oh.

4632
03:54:26,850 --> 03:54:28,450
It's getting so freaky.

4633
03:54:30,850 --> 03:54:33,550
Yeah, that's not supposed to happen while we're awake.

4634
03:54:34,910 --> 03:54:36,030
Oh jeez.

4635
03:54:36,650 --> 03:54:37,710
Oh jeez.

4636
03:54:37,830 --> 03:54:38,510
Oh jeez.

4637
03:54:38,990 --> 03:54:39,950
Oh jeez.

4638
03:54:40,410 --> 03:54:42,230
I think we're in trouble.

4639
03:54:43,350 --> 03:54:44,290
Where did Robin go?

4640
03:54:44,370 --> 03:54:45,390
She stayed in the room.

4641
03:54:46,210 --> 03:54:49,090
She said she was preparing something, but what does that mean?

4642
03:54:49,690 --> 03:54:50,610
Oh god.

4643
03:54:51,210 --> 03:54:53,090
I hope there's no monster here.

4644
03:54:55,150 --> 03:54:56,230
I need gum.

4645
03:54:56,670 --> 03:54:58,090
I guess we don't need the gum anymore.

4646
03:55:03,580 --> 03:55:04,180
Alright.

4647
03:55:05,800 --> 03:55:07,120
We can see outside.

4648
03:55:07,960 --> 03:55:11,560
It's actually way cleaner than I thought it would be.

4649
03:55:14,160 --> 03:55:14,940
What's happening?

4650
03:55:15,260 --> 03:55:15,580
Oh my god.

4651
03:55:15,580 --> 03:55:20,480
Oh, we are so... we are so borked.

4652
03:55:20,580 --> 03:55:21,960
Oh my god, we are so in trouble.

4653
03:55:22,160 --> 03:55:22,720
Oh no.

4654
03:55:23,540 --> 03:55:25,280
We are so in trouble.

4655
03:55:25,400 --> 03:55:26,140
We are so infected.

4656
03:55:26,720 --> 03:55:27,360
Oh my god.

4657
03:55:28,200 --> 03:55:29,600
Can't determine reality.

4658
03:55:29,720 --> 03:55:31,620
Wait, there was water right here!

4659
03:55:33,180 --> 03:55:34,160
Are you kidding me?

4660
03:55:34,200 --> 03:55:36,300
We could have survived on this for a little bit.

4661
03:55:37,060 --> 03:55:38,080
Oh my god.

4662
03:55:42,120 --> 03:55:44,880
We are so... this is so bad.

4663
03:55:47,240 --> 03:55:48,560
We are so... this is so bad.

4664
03:55:51,260 --> 03:55:53,020
We can't determine anything.

4665
03:55:53,360 --> 03:55:53,960
What's real?

4666
03:55:54,180 --> 03:55:55,460
What's fiction?

4667
03:55:55,660 --> 03:55:56,460
We don't know anymore.

4668
03:55:56,720 --> 03:55:57,320
Oh god.

4669
03:55:57,820 --> 03:55:58,900
Um, excuse me?

4670
03:56:00,940 --> 03:56:04,040
Mr. Security man, I can't hold my breath under here.

4671
03:56:04,380 --> 03:56:04,920
Knock on the door.

4672
03:56:06,780 --> 03:56:07,600
Ah, it's you.

4673
03:56:08,760 --> 03:56:10,480
Head to the main exit and turn right.

4674
03:56:10,740 --> 03:56:13,240
There will be a staircase to the parking lot behind the door.

4675
03:56:13,560 --> 03:56:14,620
Here's the key for it.

4676
03:56:16,160 --> 03:56:17,600
Oh, thank you.

4677
03:56:18,980 --> 03:56:19,600
Parking key.

4678
03:56:20,020 --> 03:56:21,500
I need to go downstairs to fix the light.

4679
03:56:23,480 --> 03:56:25,440
Go down there and find the generator room.

4680
03:56:26,000 --> 03:56:26,440
That's all.

4681
03:56:26,680 --> 03:56:27,340
Off you go, kid.

4682
03:56:27,980 --> 03:56:28,740
I've got work to do.

4683
03:56:28,860 --> 03:56:30,360
Not a good luck or anything?

4684
03:56:31,140 --> 03:56:32,500
It seems like he's still mad at me.

4685
03:56:32,820 --> 03:56:34,860
If he is so smart, he should go there himself.

4686
03:56:36,520 --> 03:56:37,920
No good luck or anything.

4687
03:56:38,280 --> 03:56:39,380
This guy is such a jerk.

4688
03:56:39,940 --> 03:56:41,400
So we go to the main... Oh, parking.

4689
03:56:41,600 --> 03:56:42,040
I see it.

4690
03:56:46,230 --> 03:56:48,470
Oh, we couldn't go this way before.

4691
03:56:49,230 --> 03:56:50,330
Oh, okay, okay.

4692
03:56:52,030 --> 03:56:53,150
Do it yourself.

4693
03:57:00,430 --> 03:57:04,610
I don't think whatever... I think the monster is telling the birds to shut up.

4694
03:57:05,570 --> 03:57:07,290
Whatever monster is out there.

4695
03:57:08,210 --> 03:57:09,510
Shut the hell up, bird.

4696
03:57:10,730 --> 03:57:11,490
What's in here?

4697
03:57:13,250 --> 03:57:14,330
We will never know.

4698
03:57:15,850 --> 03:57:16,690
Rip croaky.

4699
03:57:18,990 --> 03:57:19,630
Alright.

4700
03:57:23,310 --> 03:57:27,490
Into the parking lot, which is underground.

4701
03:57:28,550 --> 03:57:29,430
Lucky us.

4702
03:57:30,250 --> 03:57:31,470
I love that for us.

4703
03:57:36,200 --> 03:57:37,960
Okay, anything over here?

4704
03:57:38,320 --> 03:57:39,480
Doesn't seem to be the case.

4705
03:57:39,580 --> 03:57:39,820
Alright.

4706
03:57:43,260 --> 03:57:44,220
Oh gosh.

4707
03:57:45,260 --> 03:57:47,620
Is there anything...

4708
03:57:47,620 --> 03:57:50,540
No notes or anything of the sort?

4709
03:57:51,820 --> 03:57:54,980
Surely no one died in the parking garage, right?

4710
03:57:55,320 --> 03:57:56,180
Oh, read the note.

4711
03:57:56,800 --> 03:57:58,480
I was scolded again for falling asleep.

4712
03:57:58,660 --> 03:57:59,380
I can't help it.

4713
03:57:59,440 --> 03:58:00,580
I have such beautiful dreams.

4714
03:58:00,920 --> 03:58:03,820
And the voice... I close my eyes and I still hear it.

4715
03:58:04,080 --> 03:58:06,140
I just don't know what he's saying.

4716
03:58:06,320 --> 03:58:07,220
I need to listen.

4717
03:58:15,890 --> 03:58:17,330
Do you guys hear that?

4718
03:58:18,950 --> 03:58:22,250
I don't think... I don't think we are alone in here.

4719
03:58:28,980 --> 03:58:29,860
Oh no.

4720
03:58:30,900 --> 03:58:32,360
Of course we are not alone in here.

4721
03:58:32,500 --> 03:58:33,500
That would be ridiculous.

4722
03:58:39,810 --> 03:58:40,690
Oh gosh.

4723
03:58:42,470 --> 03:58:43,390
Where do I go?

4724
03:58:44,790 --> 03:58:46,930
Do I already have to watch out for a monster?

4725
03:58:47,870 --> 03:58:49,810
Or am I good until I get to the generator?

4726
03:58:51,610 --> 03:58:53,270
Okay, I'm careful.

4727
03:58:53,890 --> 03:58:54,690
I'm careful.

4728
03:58:55,870 --> 03:58:56,710
I'm careful.

4729
03:58:56,990 --> 03:58:57,890
Oh god, I'm careful.

4730
03:58:57,890 --> 03:59:01,050
Oh, I thought that was a monster right there.

4731
03:59:02,810 --> 03:59:04,030
My heart jumped.

4732
03:59:05,470 --> 03:59:07,270
Here, I'll turn it down a little bit.

4733
03:59:07,470 --> 03:59:09,090
Oh my gosh, a cyber truck.

4734
03:59:12,910 --> 03:59:14,790
There's another car that's on.

4735
03:59:16,130 --> 03:59:17,050
Where do I go?

4736
03:59:18,110 --> 03:59:19,370
Do I go towards the light?

4737
03:59:25,570 --> 03:59:26,090
Maybe?

4738
03:59:26,090 --> 03:59:26,190
Maybe?

4739
03:59:27,050 --> 03:59:28,430
Seems to be the case.

4740
03:59:29,610 --> 03:59:30,750
There's a thing over here.

4741
03:59:31,990 --> 03:59:33,270
Okay, again.

4742
03:59:33,610 --> 03:59:36,050
How are all the cars... How did this happen?

4743
03:59:36,570 --> 03:59:38,570
You know, like...

4744
03:59:38,570 --> 03:59:39,450
You...

4745
03:59:43,670 --> 03:59:44,710
You didn't...

4746
03:59:44,710 --> 03:59:47,410
Like, that couldn't... How did you park like this?

4747
03:59:50,030 --> 03:59:50,950
When... What?

4748
03:59:51,010 --> 03:59:51,970
Were you trying to like...

4749
03:59:52,370 --> 03:59:52,770
Wait.

4750
03:59:52,770 --> 03:59:56,490
Wait, what's down here real quick?

4751
03:59:56,570 --> 03:59:56,930
Hold on.

4752
03:59:59,970 --> 04:00:01,270
Before we get the phone.

4753
04:00:03,370 --> 04:00:06,050
Like, were you in such a rush that you...

4754
04:00:06,050 --> 04:00:06,490
Okay.

4755
04:00:06,630 --> 04:00:06,830
Oh!

4756
04:00:07,850 --> 04:00:08,650
There's a camera.

4757
04:00:08,830 --> 04:00:09,290
It's working.

4758
04:00:10,550 --> 04:00:11,890
The lights down here are working.

4759
04:00:12,070 --> 04:00:12,950
Now that I think about it.

4760
04:00:17,550 --> 04:00:17,950
Okay.

4761
04:00:19,290 --> 04:00:19,690
Alright.

4762
04:00:24,080 --> 04:00:24,520
Hello?

4763
04:00:25,120 --> 04:00:26,080
Close the door.

4764
04:00:27,200 --> 04:00:28,260
Pick up the phone.

4765
04:00:28,460 --> 04:00:28,660
Hello?

4766
04:00:29,960 --> 04:00:30,420
Are you okay?

4767
04:00:30,540 --> 04:00:32,320
I noticed some movement near you on the cameras.

4768
04:00:32,620 --> 04:00:33,120
Be careful.

4769
04:00:33,320 --> 04:00:33,480
What?

4770
04:00:33,740 --> 04:00:34,820
How is that possible?

4771
04:00:35,960 --> 04:00:36,200
Huh?

4772
04:00:37,200 --> 04:00:44,140
Isn't the issue that we don't have power so that you need me to start the generator so that you can see on the cameras?

4773
04:00:46,780 --> 04:00:47,220
Huh?

4774
04:00:53,300 --> 04:00:54,940
Can you explain what I need to do?

4775
04:00:55,040 --> 04:00:56,100
There are plenty of cars here.

4776
04:00:56,160 --> 04:00:57,400
Why not drive off in one?

4777
04:00:57,400 --> 04:00:58,900
That sounds stupid.

4778
04:00:59,100 --> 04:01:00,580
Who did you see on the cameras?

4779
04:01:00,720 --> 04:01:01,200
I'm ready.

4780
04:01:01,320 --> 04:01:02,160
Who did you see on the cameras?

4781
04:01:02,580 --> 04:01:04,240
A pale creature without eyes.

4782
04:01:04,680 --> 04:01:06,360
Your girlfriend called it a craw...

4783
04:01:06,360 --> 04:01:07,360
My girl...

4784
04:01:07,360 --> 04:01:08,080
My...

4785
04:01:10,400 --> 04:01:10,960
Girlfriend?

4786
04:01:15,200 --> 04:01:16,680
Maybe it only works here.

4787
04:01:16,880 --> 04:01:17,120
Maybe.

4788
04:01:18,860 --> 04:01:19,420
Crawler.

4789
04:01:19,420 --> 04:01:26,940
Okay, so it's the guy that... Okay, that would make sense why he... Why the alarm went off and then he broke it.

4790
04:01:28,000 --> 04:01:28,880
Be quiet.

4791
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:30,180
It seems to be drawn to you.

4792
04:01:31,320 --> 04:01:31,760
Okay.

4793
04:01:32,560 --> 04:01:34,120
Can you explain what I need to do?

4794
04:01:34,640 --> 04:01:36,940
There's an emergency generator near you, okay?

4795
04:01:37,400 --> 04:01:39,020
It should be in a working condition.

4796
04:01:39,200 --> 04:01:40,220
It's just out of fuel.

4797
04:01:41,840 --> 04:01:45,480
Find a canister and siphon off some gas from a couple of cars.

4798
04:01:45,760 --> 04:01:48,240
As soon as you fill the tank, start the generator.

4799
04:01:50,360 --> 04:01:52,020
There are plenty of cars here.

4800
04:01:52,060 --> 04:01:54,000
Okay, I'm gonna ask this even though I think it's kind of silly.

4801
04:01:54,640 --> 04:01:55,640
I wouldn't recommend it.

4802
04:01:56,180 --> 04:01:57,940
Several guests tried to do that on the first day.

4803
04:01:58,440 --> 04:02:00,940
I can still see their wrecked cars on the external cameras.

4804
04:02:01,600 --> 04:02:04,120
You wouldn't want to run into what's out there on the streets.

4805
04:02:07,160 --> 04:02:07,900
I'm ready.

4806
04:02:08,520 --> 04:02:12,440
Alright, take a canister and siphon off some gas, then refuel the generator and start it.

4807
04:02:13,220 --> 04:02:14,400
And one more thing.

4808
04:02:14,460 --> 04:02:15,160
Okay, Columbo.

4809
04:02:15,780 --> 04:02:19,660
Once the emergency lights kick in, the elevator will start working too.

4810
04:02:20,500 --> 04:02:22,340
Use it to go up to the top floor.

4811
04:02:23,280 --> 04:02:27,160
I've finished setting up the transmitter, but I need you to make some tweaks to the antenna.

4812
04:02:27,700 --> 04:02:30,000
If everything goes well, we'll contact the rescuers today.

4813
04:02:31,780 --> 04:02:32,740
Good luck, kid.

4814
04:02:35,940 --> 04:02:38,720
Okay, seems like this is our final challenge.

4815
04:02:39,480 --> 04:02:41,740
Alright, it just saved, so cool.

4816
04:02:41,820 --> 04:02:44,580
If I die, we're good.

4817
04:02:45,680 --> 04:02:48,840
Oh my goodness, why is it lagging all of a sudden?

4818
04:02:50,600 --> 04:02:54,400
He saw how I watched him from around the corner and he understood everything.

4819
04:02:54,740 --> 04:02:55,760
He knows what I'm thinking.

4820
04:02:56,100 --> 04:02:56,940
He knows what I'm doing.

4821
04:02:57,080 --> 04:02:58,400
He senses who I am inside.

4822
04:02:58,760 --> 04:03:00,040
I need to stay away from him.

4823
04:03:01,540 --> 04:03:02,780
What does that mean?

4824
04:03:04,360 --> 04:03:05,560
He said good luck.

4825
04:03:05,800 --> 04:03:07,300
Yeah, he finally said it!

4826
04:03:09,720 --> 04:03:10,760
Okay, alright.

4827
04:03:11,260 --> 04:03:14,100
So we put it into here and then we pull that, I guess?

4828
04:03:14,520 --> 04:03:15,740
This thing looks ancient.

4829
04:03:16,640 --> 04:03:18,260
No wonder it broke down.

4830
04:03:19,040 --> 04:03:20,440
We don't have to do anything else here?

4831
04:03:21,100 --> 04:03:21,940
Electrical hazard?

4832
04:03:22,240 --> 04:03:22,440
No?

4833
04:03:22,580 --> 04:03:22,760
Okay.

4834
04:03:29,990 --> 04:03:31,770
I wish I could crawl.

4835
04:03:34,110 --> 04:03:34,530
You know?

4836
04:03:36,610 --> 04:03:38,870
What cars are good to siphon gas from?

4837
04:03:40,190 --> 04:03:41,110
There he is.

4838
04:03:42,290 --> 04:03:43,430
Oh my god.

4839
04:03:43,510 --> 04:03:43,810
No!

4840
04:03:46,370 --> 04:03:46,870
No!

4841
04:03:49,650 --> 04:03:50,530
Okay, good.

4842
04:03:50,570 --> 04:03:51,270
He turned that way.

4843
04:03:52,330 --> 04:03:54,770
Let's get all the cars that are close to us first.

4844
04:03:55,390 --> 04:03:55,750
Right?

4845
04:03:57,750 --> 04:03:58,750
Or not?

4846
04:03:59,170 --> 04:04:00,030
Can we get this car?

4847
04:04:02,290 --> 04:04:03,530
Where is the gas?

4848
04:04:05,930 --> 04:04:07,630
Where is the...

4849
04:04:08,650 --> 04:04:11,310
Where is the hole for the gas?

4850
04:04:13,830 --> 04:04:14,790
Okay, nevermind.

4851
04:04:15,730 --> 04:04:16,210
Understandable.

4852
04:04:17,330 --> 04:04:20,290
I hope this doesn't take me several tries.

4853
04:04:20,410 --> 04:04:20,850
I'm scared.

4854
04:04:22,730 --> 04:04:23,950
I'm scared of this one.

4855
04:04:24,210 --> 04:04:25,850
I don't want it to take me a long time.

4856
04:04:27,130 --> 04:04:27,730
I'm scared.

4857
04:04:33,660 --> 04:04:34,480
Maybe here?

4858
04:04:35,280 --> 04:04:36,420
Oh, an electric vehicle.

4859
04:04:36,580 --> 04:04:37,360
Probably, right?

4860
04:04:40,100 --> 04:04:41,460
Where did he... Oh, okay.

4861
04:04:44,000 --> 04:04:45,540
How close can I be to him?

4862
04:04:47,040 --> 04:04:47,620
Siphon gas.

4863
04:04:50,560 --> 04:04:51,680
Does it make a lot of sound?

4864
04:04:53,640 --> 04:04:54,260
Oh my god.

4865
04:04:54,820 --> 04:04:55,700
Okay, we're doing it.

4866
04:04:55,740 --> 04:04:56,060
We're doing it.

4867
04:04:56,120 --> 04:04:56,520
Nice, nice.

4868
04:04:56,640 --> 04:04:56,980
Oh my god.

4869
04:04:57,100 --> 04:04:57,760
He's coming this way.

4870
04:04:58,900 --> 04:04:59,820
We need to get out of here.

4871
04:05:00,160 --> 04:05:00,400
Pronto.

4872
04:05:01,600 --> 04:05:02,100
Oh shit.

4873
04:05:03,340 --> 04:05:04,220
Oh my god.

4874
04:05:04,400 --> 04:05:05,760
Okay, we'll come for that one last.

4875
04:05:07,340 --> 04:05:08,420
Oh my god.

4876
04:05:08,500 --> 04:05:09,320
Oh my god.

4877
04:05:09,320 --> 04:05:09,960
That was so close.

4878
04:05:13,180 --> 04:05:14,300
Holy cannoli.

4879
04:05:16,520 --> 04:05:18,860
That was so close.

4880
04:05:21,780 --> 04:05:22,860
Oh my god.

4881
04:05:22,980 --> 04:05:24,100
Stop following me.

4882
04:05:24,360 --> 04:05:24,840
Please.

4883
04:05:30,140 --> 04:05:31,780
Stop following me, please.

4884
04:05:33,340 --> 04:05:34,440
Don't turn around.

4885
04:05:36,460 --> 04:05:37,520
I hate you.

4886
04:05:43,830 --> 04:05:44,950
This is messed up.

4887
04:05:45,110 --> 04:05:47,450
I was literally just about to stand right there.

4888
04:05:49,970 --> 04:05:51,270
This is so messed up.

4889
04:05:52,450 --> 04:05:52,930
Mister.

4890
04:05:54,170 --> 04:05:56,170
This is stressing me the hell out.

4891
04:05:56,270 --> 04:05:56,950
I'm not gonna lie.

4892
04:06:00,700 --> 04:06:01,560
Get the gas.

4893
04:06:02,220 --> 04:06:02,860
Get the gas.

4894
04:06:04,720 --> 04:06:06,920
I don't know how this is working, but whatever.

4895
04:06:09,700 --> 04:06:11,580
I wonder if he runs into me.

4896
04:06:14,520 --> 04:06:16,080
Okay, he's all the way over there.

4897
04:06:16,640 --> 04:06:17,160
Maybe what?

4898
04:06:17,260 --> 04:06:18,080
Like two more cars?

4899
04:06:30,030 --> 04:06:30,850
The blue car.

4900
04:06:30,930 --> 04:06:32,270
Yeah, I'm gonna go for that one last.

4901
04:06:35,790 --> 04:06:37,250
Gonna go for that one last.

4902
04:06:38,910 --> 04:06:40,810
Yeah, I can't look around while he's siphoning.

4903
04:06:40,970 --> 04:06:41,810
I know it's scary.

4904
04:06:46,150 --> 04:06:47,910
Do you think one or two?

4905
04:06:48,630 --> 04:06:49,470
I can't tell.

4906
04:06:49,470 --> 04:06:51,470
I also don't know where he is at all.

4907
04:06:54,890 --> 04:06:55,210
Mister.

4908
04:06:58,390 --> 04:06:59,090
Oh, there he is.

4909
04:06:59,170 --> 04:06:59,630
Oh, he's far.

4910
04:07:00,270 --> 04:07:01,870
But actually I need to go back that way.

4911
04:07:02,850 --> 04:07:05,450
If he could not do that, actually.

4912
04:07:09,130 --> 04:07:13,030
Okay, I think we just need one more so we can go back to the blue car, probably.

4913
04:07:14,010 --> 04:07:16,630
Actually, why would I do that if this one has it?

4914
04:07:16,690 --> 04:07:17,010
You know what?

4915
04:07:17,070 --> 04:07:17,470
He's far.

4916
04:07:18,350 --> 04:07:19,350
Actually, where is he?

4917
04:07:20,270 --> 04:07:22,990
We'll just sneak past on the way over there, I think.

4918
04:07:24,350 --> 04:07:25,650
Okay, I think we're good.

4919
04:07:30,400 --> 04:07:31,960
Okay, it just saved!

4920
04:07:32,060 --> 04:07:34,040
Oh my gosh, the game is so kind.

4921
04:07:35,040 --> 04:07:36,040
Wow, it just saved.

4922
04:07:36,120 --> 04:07:40,080
So I guess if I die at this part trying to head back...

4923
04:07:40,080 --> 04:07:42,120
I don't have to collect all the gas again.

4924
04:07:45,260 --> 04:07:47,240
The game is actually so kind.

4925
04:07:54,380 --> 04:07:56,420
Please, please, please, please.

4926
04:08:02,850 --> 04:08:03,850
Can I run?

4927
04:08:05,390 --> 04:08:06,490
Okay, seems like I can run.

4928
04:08:10,800 --> 04:08:12,220
Well, jog.

4929
04:08:12,880 --> 04:08:14,180
Whatever you call this.

4930
04:08:14,960 --> 04:08:16,920
I can't... What was that?

4931
04:08:18,520 --> 04:08:19,480
Did he notice me?

4932
04:08:21,040 --> 04:08:21,560
No.

4933
04:08:22,360 --> 04:08:23,300
He didn't notice me, right?

4934
04:08:27,220 --> 04:08:29,440
Actually... Oh, the elevator.

4935
04:08:29,880 --> 04:08:30,860
I think it's down here.

4936
04:08:31,600 --> 04:08:33,600
So we will keep that open.

4937
04:08:34,320 --> 04:08:36,240
Okay, pour the gasoline.

4938
04:08:44,040 --> 04:08:46,080
Walking slightly fast.

4939
04:08:48,660 --> 04:08:51,520
Okay, and it's full, baby.

4940
04:08:51,860 --> 04:08:52,320
Nice.

4941
04:08:57,520 --> 04:08:59,260
What do I hear behind there?

4942
04:08:59,600 --> 04:09:00,600
Oh my God, no way.

4943
04:09:02,420 --> 04:09:04,240
No, no, no, no, no.

4944
04:09:05,380 --> 04:09:06,140
Oh my God.

4945
04:09:06,460 --> 04:09:07,340
No, no, no, no.

4946
04:09:08,440 --> 04:09:09,200
Oh my God.

4947
04:09:09,300 --> 04:09:10,780
Please, please, please, please, please hurry.

4948
04:09:11,280 --> 04:09:14,120
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

4949
04:09:17,180 --> 04:09:17,600
It's on!

4950
04:09:25,840 --> 04:09:26,980
Oh my God.

4951
04:09:27,400 --> 04:09:27,780
Elevator!

4952
04:09:27,780 --> 04:09:33,190
I think we are so dead.

4953
04:09:37,730 --> 04:09:39,350
Wait, did he shoot me?

4954
04:09:39,570 --> 04:09:40,810
No, he shot the monster.

4955
04:09:42,070 --> 04:09:43,430
He aimed it right at my head!

4956
04:09:44,330 --> 04:09:45,090
How am I alive?

4957
04:09:45,690 --> 04:09:46,270
Come in.

4958
04:09:47,010 --> 04:09:47,530
Priest!

4959
04:09:50,690 --> 04:09:52,110
Why were you in there?

4960
04:09:54,730 --> 04:09:56,150
Priest, how did...

4961
04:10:01,290 --> 04:10:03,830
Wait, were you just locked in the elevator?

4962
04:10:04,810 --> 04:10:05,630
Maybe I should thank you.

4963
04:10:05,650 --> 04:10:06,270
Thank you!

4964
04:10:06,770 --> 04:10:08,130
There is no need for gratitude.

4965
04:10:12,450 --> 04:10:13,590
Stop the elevator.

4966
04:10:14,410 --> 04:10:15,990
Wait, no?

4967
04:10:16,110 --> 04:10:16,450
Are you sure?

4968
04:10:17,310 --> 04:10:17,790
Why?

4969
04:10:18,950 --> 04:10:20,510
Stop the elevator.

4970
04:10:22,390 --> 04:10:23,570
He is so demanding.

4971
04:10:23,570 --> 04:10:24,370
Oh my God.

4972
04:10:25,570 --> 04:10:26,910
Stop the elevator.

4973
04:10:28,370 --> 04:10:28,970
I'm stopping it?

4974
04:10:29,010 --> 04:10:29,570
I stopped it?

4975
04:10:29,870 --> 04:10:29,990
Yeah?

4976
04:10:31,390 --> 04:10:32,590
What is that going to do?

4977
04:10:34,230 --> 04:10:34,710
Good.

4978
04:10:35,130 --> 04:10:37,490
I think you need like a suppressor on that thing, man.

4979
04:10:37,770 --> 04:10:41,390
There are creatures in here that are really sensitive to sound.

4980
04:10:42,270 --> 04:10:43,110
Young woman.

4981
04:10:43,890 --> 04:10:45,770
She was walking next to you a few days ago.

4982
04:10:46,610 --> 04:10:48,270
Why do creepy things never have eyes?

4983
04:10:48,830 --> 04:10:50,290
Why no ears or nose?

4984
04:10:51,290 --> 04:10:51,870
I don't know.

4985
04:10:53,310 --> 04:10:54,270
It's like...

4986
04:10:54,270 --> 04:10:57,890
To get the creepy buff, you have to lose one of the five senses.

4987
04:10:58,270 --> 04:10:59,410
I almost said six senses.

4988
04:10:59,530 --> 04:11:00,250
Sorry, I'm a ghost.

4989
04:11:02,890 --> 04:11:03,670
Describe her.

4990
04:11:04,270 --> 04:11:06,350
But remember, lying is a sin.

4991
04:11:06,930 --> 04:11:09,810
Oh, and sinners will face God's punishment.

4992
04:11:12,570 --> 04:11:14,710
Just an acquaintance, nothing special.

4993
04:11:15,270 --> 04:11:16,550
I don't understand what you mean.

4994
04:11:16,630 --> 04:11:17,030
No, no, no.

4995
04:11:17,050 --> 04:11:18,030
He wants me to describe her.

4996
04:11:18,030 --> 04:11:19,390
Black clothes.

4997
04:11:19,630 --> 04:11:21,910
Wait, black hair, dark clothes.

4998
04:11:24,290 --> 04:11:24,810
Energetic.

4999
04:11:26,950 --> 04:11:29,170
Alright, you can't describe her face.

5000
04:11:29,830 --> 04:11:32,630
I described her!

5001
04:11:34,350 --> 04:11:36,270
What do you want me to say about her face?

5002
04:11:36,730 --> 04:11:41,060
Little tiny button nose and big anime eyeballs.

5003
04:11:42,270 --> 04:11:45,130
And a fang.

5004
04:11:45,570 --> 04:11:47,570
One of her teeth is a fang.

5005
04:11:47,570 --> 04:11:48,710
What do you want me to say?

5006
04:11:51,010 --> 04:11:52,090
What's her name?

5007
04:11:57,770 --> 04:12:00,370
I can't say I don't know her name.

5008
04:12:00,650 --> 04:12:02,210
I either lie or...

5009
04:12:05,490 --> 04:12:09,730
I can't say that I don't know her name because I've been with her for...

5010
04:12:09,730 --> 04:12:11,430
I've been with her for eight days.

5011
04:12:11,490 --> 04:12:12,250
There's no way.

5012
04:12:13,070 --> 04:12:14,450
I think I should tell the truth.

5013
04:12:15,590 --> 04:12:16,150
Robin.

5014
04:12:17,230 --> 04:12:17,790
Interesting.

5015
04:12:19,030 --> 04:12:21,190
The girl I'm looking for was named Robin.

5016
04:12:22,450 --> 04:12:24,410
Guys, I think I messed up.

5017
04:12:26,790 --> 04:12:27,950
Snitches get stitches.

5018
04:12:28,230 --> 04:12:29,470
He has a gun pointed...

5019
04:12:29,470 --> 04:12:31,830
I'm literally staring down this barrel right now.

5020
04:12:31,910 --> 04:12:32,850
What are you talking about?

5021
04:12:33,730 --> 04:12:37,030
She had light hair and was dressed in simple modest clothing.

5022
04:12:38,350 --> 04:12:40,350
Robin is a really popular name.

5023
04:12:41,490 --> 04:12:42,290
Maybe it's her.

5024
04:12:42,810 --> 04:12:43,530
Maybe not.

5025
04:12:44,450 --> 04:12:45,750
She betrayed her parents.

5026
04:12:46,150 --> 04:12:48,550
Stole from the community of simple God-fearing people.

5027
04:12:49,730 --> 04:12:53,270
I came to guide her back to the righteous path.

5028
04:12:54,130 --> 04:12:56,890
I thought he was going to be her father.

5029
04:12:57,090 --> 04:12:59,450
Also, this man's yaoi hands...

5030
04:12:59,970 --> 04:13:02,450
Wait, does he have six fingers?

5031
04:13:03,130 --> 04:13:04,450
One, two, three, four...

5032
04:13:06,070 --> 04:13:07,490
Does he have...

5033
04:13:13,060 --> 04:13:14,400
Bro has grippers.

5034
04:13:14,400 --> 04:13:17,400
Does he have really...

5035
04:13:17,960 --> 04:13:19,180
I don't think it's AI.

5036
04:13:21,160 --> 04:13:25,160
I think his hands are just... I think this part is what's throwing me off.

5037
04:13:26,040 --> 04:13:28,120
It's like a big chunk of his hand.

5038
04:13:32,140 --> 04:13:33,400
It's just funky looking.

5039
04:13:33,520 --> 04:13:34,800
It's a funny pose, I think.

5040
04:13:35,840 --> 04:13:37,280
Nice gifted mintsub.

5041
04:13:37,620 --> 04:13:38,720
Thank you.

5042
04:13:41,140 --> 04:13:42,940
Do you think this is the girl you saw?

5043
04:13:43,920 --> 04:13:44,960
No, it's another girl.

5044
04:13:46,440 --> 04:13:47,040
You think so?

5045
04:13:47,600 --> 04:13:48,460
Alright, my son.

5046
04:13:48,780 --> 04:13:50,060
I'll take your word for it.

5047
04:13:51,620 --> 04:13:54,040
I've been waiting for this a long time.

5048
04:13:54,500 --> 04:13:55,320
Waiting for what?

5049
04:13:56,040 --> 04:13:59,020
When God pays attention to the sin of the earth.

5050
04:13:59,360 --> 04:14:03,420
The weak transform into their aspirations and destroy each other.

5051
04:14:04,700 --> 04:14:05,620
You want to get out?

5052
04:14:06,020 --> 04:14:07,460
That's why you're going upstairs.

5053
04:14:08,180 --> 04:14:09,560
To call for rescue.

5054
04:14:10,700 --> 04:14:13,300
But one of you has already fallen prey to the devil.

5055
04:14:13,300 --> 04:14:16,020
He's already heeding it's whispers.

5056
04:14:16,860 --> 04:14:18,040
Do you know who?

5057
04:14:21,560 --> 04:14:22,740
I don't know.

5058
04:14:23,640 --> 04:14:24,700
Don't lie to me.

5059
04:14:24,920 --> 04:14:25,800
It's me!

5060
04:14:26,100 --> 04:14:26,660
It's me!

5061
04:14:27,740 --> 04:14:30,220
The world has shown God it's true nature.

5062
04:14:30,620 --> 04:14:32,000
And he is displeased.

5063
04:14:32,920 --> 04:14:33,940
I hear his voice.

5064
04:14:34,660 --> 04:14:36,540
Oh, you're hearing voices!

5065
04:14:36,820 --> 04:14:38,300
Oh yeah, this guy is totally infected.

5066
04:14:39,560 --> 04:14:41,860
I still don't know which one of you harbors the devil.

5067
04:14:41,860 --> 04:14:44,060
But I won't let him escape.

5068
04:14:47,590 --> 04:14:48,950
This is my floor.

5069
04:14:50,850 --> 04:14:52,250
See you around.

5070
04:14:52,650 --> 04:14:53,750
Until we meet again.

5071
04:14:54,170 --> 04:14:55,030
I sure hope not.

5072
04:15:03,220 --> 04:15:05,140
Where did the buttons go?

5073
04:15:07,560 --> 04:15:08,760
We're at the rooftop.

5074
04:15:12,750 --> 04:15:15,410
The lady in white said we won't meet again.

5075
04:15:16,430 --> 04:15:17,930
Oh my gosh.

5076
04:15:18,250 --> 04:15:19,410
God, that scared me.

5077
04:15:21,070 --> 04:15:22,150
Oh my gosh.

5078
04:15:24,550 --> 04:15:25,130
Hello?

5079
04:15:27,570 --> 04:15:28,770
Oh, she's here!

5080
04:15:29,170 --> 04:15:29,550
Robin!

5081
04:15:33,070 --> 04:15:35,750
I was going to say the birds are gone, but clearly they're not.

5082
04:15:36,790 --> 04:15:38,390
Is it still party time?

5083
04:15:39,070 --> 04:15:40,690
They even took down...

5084
04:15:40,690 --> 04:15:44,050
They even took down the party time flyer?

5085
04:15:44,110 --> 04:15:44,830
That's so sad.

5086
04:15:47,820 --> 04:15:48,740
Hello?

5087
04:16:04,010 --> 04:16:06,530
Try to fix what?

5088
04:16:07,290 --> 04:16:08,550
Aww, Robin.

5089
04:16:09,170 --> 04:16:10,410
See, she's not bad.

5090
04:16:18,640 --> 04:16:20,640
She'll show me the world.

5091
04:16:23,520 --> 04:16:24,020
Wait.

5092
04:16:31,390 --> 04:16:33,030
Our apple and our banana.

5093
04:16:33,510 --> 04:16:35,090
Even our Doritos are rotting.

5094
04:16:38,990 --> 04:16:40,630
There's a person standing down there.

5095
04:16:41,510 --> 04:16:47,190
Oh my god, I think that's the first time we've ever seen anything standing outside of the hotel.

5096
04:16:47,570 --> 04:16:49,790
Any creature.

5097
04:16:50,050 --> 04:16:52,470
It's probably infected, but that's kind of crazy.

5098
04:16:54,470 --> 04:16:55,450
Oh my god.

5099
04:16:56,010 --> 04:16:57,890
It's starting to lag a little bit for me again.

5100
04:17:00,190 --> 04:17:02,190
Even our Doritos were like brown.

5101
04:17:04,610 --> 04:17:06,030
Wasn't this thing already fixed?

5102
04:17:06,870 --> 04:17:07,770
I can do it.

5103
04:17:08,630 --> 04:17:09,890
Oh okay, I know how to do this.

5104
04:17:10,870 --> 04:17:11,650
Pick up the phone.

5105
04:17:11,970 --> 04:17:12,170
Hello?

5106
04:17:13,670 --> 04:17:15,210
Hey kid, glad you made it.

5107
04:17:15,950 --> 04:17:18,330
I would not have made it without the priest though.

5108
04:17:18,330 --> 04:17:22,170
The girl wanted to help, but she is a total zero in any sort of tech.

5109
04:17:23,010 --> 04:17:25,510
I found settings that will help us contact rescuers.

5110
04:17:25,770 --> 04:17:26,590
We need to check them.

5111
04:17:27,350 --> 04:17:28,350
You already know the drill.

5112
04:17:28,630 --> 04:17:31,590
Set the voltage to 13 volts and tune in the wave.

5113
04:17:31,790 --> 04:17:32,790
Wait, it says 12.

5114
04:17:34,710 --> 04:17:35,430
Are you sure?

5115
04:17:35,870 --> 04:17:36,550
Psycho Mantis?

5116
04:17:40,450 --> 04:17:41,310
I'm on the phone.

5117
04:17:42,730 --> 04:17:43,990
I know what to do.

5118
04:17:44,250 --> 04:17:45,150
I have to do math.

5119
04:17:46,990 --> 04:17:47,690
Oh man.

5120
04:17:47,830 --> 04:17:48,030
Wait.

5121
04:17:48,030 --> 04:17:50,390
Oh, it's at 12.

5122
04:17:50,570 --> 04:17:51,530
I have to set it to...

5123
04:17:51,530 --> 04:17:52,430
Oh, okay, just kidding.

5124
04:17:54,270 --> 04:17:55,290
It's at 12.

5125
04:17:55,330 --> 04:17:56,370
I have to set it to 13.

5126
04:18:00,690 --> 04:18:01,470
Let's see.

5127
04:18:03,890 --> 04:18:05,630
It said 8 earlier.

5128
04:18:05,870 --> 04:18:06,990
Maybe he updated it.

5129
04:18:08,530 --> 04:18:09,490
I have to do math.

5130
04:18:09,610 --> 04:18:09,770
Okay.

5131
04:18:13,800 --> 04:18:14,540
Okay, I know.

5132
04:18:15,400 --> 04:18:15,760
Oh, whoops.

5133
04:18:16,320 --> 04:18:19,040
3, 2, 8.

5134
04:18:20,700 --> 04:18:23,380
I got it all on my own.

5135
04:18:24,460 --> 04:18:26,240
Alright, next is this thing.

5136
04:18:26,960 --> 04:18:27,680
Tune the antenna.

5137
04:18:28,660 --> 04:18:30,880
We got to rotate this right a little.

5138
04:18:33,560 --> 04:18:34,660
Wait, did that do anything?

5139
04:18:34,800 --> 04:18:35,320
Rotate it right.

5140
04:18:35,920 --> 04:18:36,660
Okay, there we go.

5141
04:18:37,180 --> 04:18:37,920
Rotate it right.

5142
04:18:38,300 --> 04:18:38,740
Nice.

5143
04:18:40,940 --> 04:18:43,500
Pull the lever that's located to the right of the phone.

5144
04:18:44,580 --> 04:18:45,660
Let me out.

5145
04:18:48,060 --> 04:18:49,060
Okay, hold on.

5146
04:18:50,220 --> 04:18:51,920
There's order of operations here.

5147
04:18:53,720 --> 04:18:54,740
It's not working.

5148
04:18:54,960 --> 04:18:55,380
Damn.

5149
04:18:55,700 --> 04:18:56,000
No!

5150
04:18:58,820 --> 04:18:59,660
Something's wrong.

5151
04:19:00,600 --> 04:19:02,220
Days of work down the drain.

5152
04:19:02,380 --> 04:19:02,560
No!

5153
04:19:03,240 --> 04:19:04,460
Maybe we should increase the voltage.

5154
04:19:06,200 --> 04:19:08,880
Make it display 18 volts and change the wave to a new one.

5155
04:19:09,880 --> 04:19:11,300
Okay, okay, okay.

5156
04:19:12,540 --> 04:19:13,040
Why?

5157
04:19:13,180 --> 04:19:14,460
I just did the math.

5158
04:19:17,220 --> 04:19:19,280
I just did the math.

5159
04:19:19,520 --> 04:19:20,740
Come on.

5160
04:19:34,580 --> 04:19:35,940
Hold on.

5161
04:19:40,240 --> 04:19:41,140
Hold on.

5162
04:19:41,260 --> 04:19:42,660
I'm not looking at chat.

5163
04:19:49,750 --> 04:19:51,090
It needs to be 18.

5164
04:19:54,790 --> 04:19:56,490
7, 5, 6.

5165
04:19:56,810 --> 04:19:57,490
Okay.

5166
04:19:58,490 --> 04:19:59,550
I did it?

5167
04:20:00,390 --> 04:20:01,550
And now I did this?

5168
04:20:02,670 --> 04:20:03,810
Oh, to make it teeny tiny.

5169
04:20:04,550 --> 04:20:05,150
Turn the antenna.

5170
04:20:06,270 --> 04:20:07,230
Rotate to left.

5171
04:20:08,190 --> 04:20:09,990
We have to make it so short and small.

5172
04:20:11,150 --> 04:20:11,890
Like so.

5173
04:20:12,150 --> 04:20:12,770
Rotate left.

5174
04:20:14,090 --> 04:20:15,830
Okay, now rotate right.

5175
04:20:16,610 --> 04:20:17,490
And right again.

5176
04:20:18,370 --> 04:20:19,050
And right again.

5177
04:20:20,070 --> 04:20:20,770
And right again.

5178
04:20:22,030 --> 04:20:22,570
Okay.

5179
04:20:23,610 --> 04:20:23,970
Okay.

5180
04:20:26,510 --> 04:20:30,110
How would the frequency... Why would we need to change the frequency?

5181
04:20:33,090 --> 04:20:33,810
Wandering Taco!

5182
04:20:34,130 --> 04:20:34,950
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

5183
04:20:38,850 --> 04:20:40,410
I don't know what else can be done.

5184
04:20:41,030 --> 04:20:42,570
Is it not an electricity thing?

5185
04:20:44,810 --> 04:20:45,670
Ah, to hell with it.

5186
04:20:45,710 --> 04:20:47,950
Just crank the voltage to the max and pull the lever.

5187
04:20:48,410 --> 04:20:49,550
What have we got to lose anyway?

5188
04:20:50,110 --> 04:20:51,030
So true.

5189
04:20:51,250 --> 04:20:52,330
Okay, max.

5190
04:20:55,370 --> 04:20:56,710
Yeah, I know.

5191
04:20:58,530 --> 04:20:59,630
Oh, pull it!

5192
04:21:03,730 --> 04:21:04,610
It worked!

5193
04:21:10,950 --> 04:21:12,950
Oh my god, we are going to call for help.

5194
04:21:13,530 --> 04:21:14,090
It worked kid!

5195
04:21:14,150 --> 04:21:15,630
I'm sending a signal to the rescuers.

5196
04:21:15,990 --> 04:21:17,430
If it works, we'll get an answer soon.

5197
04:21:17,730 --> 04:21:18,650
Now let's wait guys.

5198
04:21:18,670 --> 04:21:19,170
Let's wait.

5199
04:21:19,170 --> 04:21:20,670
I like how they just... You know what?

5200
04:21:21,050 --> 04:21:24,870
After all this time, I really like that they just assumed that there were rescuers.

5201
04:21:26,350 --> 04:21:27,770
That were coming, you know?

5202
04:21:27,890 --> 04:21:29,210
Like just...

5203
04:21:29,210 --> 04:21:33,050
They're like, oh yeah, there's got to be some people out there that will pick us up.

5204
04:21:34,590 --> 04:21:34,990
Alright.

5205
04:21:37,670 --> 04:21:38,650
Is it the picnic?

5206
04:21:38,830 --> 04:21:40,210
I kind of spoiled myself, I'm sorry.

5207
04:21:41,190 --> 04:21:42,970
I'm sorry Robin, I saw it.

5208
04:21:48,380 --> 04:21:50,300
I still only see the what is...

5209
04:21:51,200 --> 04:21:52,160
Okay, chill out.

5210
04:21:52,200 --> 04:21:52,660
Hold on.

5211
04:21:53,620 --> 04:21:54,820
Do you think that's the voice?

5212
04:21:54,900 --> 04:21:55,300
I wonder.

5213
04:21:55,500 --> 04:21:57,220
Because it's the only person I see.

5214
04:21:58,380 --> 04:21:59,640
I wonder if that's the voice.

5215
04:22:00,040 --> 04:22:01,300
Come on!

5216
04:22:04,740 --> 04:22:06,300
So needy, I know.

5217
04:22:07,000 --> 04:22:07,960
I like her that way.

5218
04:22:09,380 --> 04:22:09,840
Hello.

5219
04:22:23,780 --> 04:22:24,260
Yeah.

5220
04:22:24,560 --> 04:22:26,460
Oh my gosh, she's so beautiful in the...

5221
04:22:26,460 --> 04:22:28,680
In the apocalyptic sunlight.

5222
04:22:31,320 --> 04:22:33,560
It'll be difficult if we consider the view.

5223
04:22:34,040 --> 04:22:35,280
Thank you, that's very nice.

5224
04:22:35,640 --> 04:22:36,740
I think it's too dangerous.

5225
04:22:38,440 --> 04:22:42,220
Okay, we're not going to be like Raiden here because Raiden would say the wrong answer.

5226
04:22:42,320 --> 04:22:42,920
So thank you.

5227
04:22:43,260 --> 04:22:44,380
That's very nice.

5228
04:22:46,940 --> 04:22:49,420
I mean if we die, at least we die in style.

5229
04:22:50,300 --> 04:22:51,720
It's very important for me.

5230
04:22:52,200 --> 04:22:55,880
Let's stay just for a couple of minutes and wait for an answer.

5231
04:22:56,260 --> 04:22:56,500
Yeah.

5232
04:22:56,620 --> 04:23:00,520
And if we'll not receive it, we'll just leave.

5233
04:23:00,760 --> 04:23:01,060
Okay.

5234
04:23:01,920 --> 04:23:03,560
Can you like turn off the radio though?

5235
04:23:03,600 --> 04:23:04,480
Because it's just static.

5236
04:23:07,440 --> 04:23:09,220
Well, why are you just sitting?

5237
04:23:09,640 --> 04:23:10,400
Take some food.

5238
04:23:10,520 --> 04:23:11,040
Help yourself.

5239
04:23:11,820 --> 04:23:14,460
Oh my god, this is actually dangerous.

5240
04:23:14,760 --> 04:23:15,280
Wait a second.

5241
04:23:15,840 --> 04:23:18,080
Girl, don't do it Robin.

5242
04:23:18,080 --> 04:23:19,560
Robin, no!

5243
04:23:20,940 --> 04:23:24,260
Oh my god, that is the biggest bird I've ever seen.

5244
04:23:24,980 --> 04:23:29,580
Holy shit, they didn't scale the bird for like how far away he is.

5245
04:23:29,600 --> 04:23:31,340
So he's actually just ginormous.

5246
04:23:32,380 --> 04:23:32,820
Wait!

5247
04:23:33,580 --> 04:23:35,420
I see another person standing down there.

5248
04:23:36,800 --> 04:23:38,220
Maybe it isn't the voice.

5249
04:23:39,080 --> 04:23:40,760
Maybe it's just creepy infected people.

5250
04:23:43,360 --> 04:23:43,800
I'm eating.

5251
04:23:43,800 --> 04:23:45,360
How do you like it?

5252
04:23:46,380 --> 04:23:47,340
Rotten banana.

5253
04:23:51,780 --> 04:23:52,300
Delish.

5254
04:23:52,900 --> 04:23:54,300
Even the plate is nasty.

5255
04:23:54,440 --> 04:23:56,120
We couldn't even rinse that under...

5256
04:23:56,120 --> 04:23:58,260
Oh, this thing is starting to mold.

5257
04:23:59,480 --> 04:24:00,340
This is very tasty.

5258
04:24:00,560 --> 04:24:00,980
Thank you.

5259
04:24:01,060 --> 04:24:01,980
I'm gonna... You know what?

5260
04:24:03,680 --> 04:24:04,740
It's starting to mold.

5261
04:24:05,220 --> 04:24:08,060
Sorry, we don't have much food left.

5262
04:24:08,200 --> 04:24:09,540
Oh, I didn't mean to make her sad.

5263
04:24:09,540 --> 04:24:10,140
Listen.

5264
04:24:11,720 --> 04:24:13,600
I want to tell you something.

5265
04:24:13,780 --> 04:24:14,940
This is it guys.

5266
04:24:15,360 --> 04:24:15,940
The confession.

5267
04:24:16,680 --> 04:24:17,500
I lied to you.

5268
04:24:18,520 --> 04:24:21,380
But you probably already guessed it yourself.

5269
04:24:22,260 --> 04:24:23,100
Wait, what do you mean by that?

5270
04:24:23,740 --> 04:24:25,820
I ran away from home.

5271
04:24:26,020 --> 04:24:27,380
You are so quiet, Robin.

5272
04:24:27,460 --> 04:24:27,720
Please.

5273
04:24:28,420 --> 04:24:30,140
This wasn't an ordinary house.

5274
04:24:30,440 --> 04:24:31,360
I can't hear you.

5275
04:24:37,300 --> 04:24:39,640
We were extremely religious.

5276
04:24:39,640 --> 04:24:42,080
Is that why she became a goth babe?

5277
04:24:43,180 --> 04:24:45,540
We were taught to be free of the outside world.

5278
04:24:46,000 --> 04:24:48,220
They divided everyone into two groups.

5279
04:24:48,840 --> 04:24:51,460
The faithful and the damned.

5280
04:24:51,740 --> 04:24:54,340
We were punished for the smallest mistakes.

5281
04:24:54,540 --> 04:24:55,380
Is she getting quieter?

5282
04:24:55,500 --> 04:24:56,460
It feels like it, right?

5283
04:24:56,520 --> 04:24:57,360
It's so quiet.

5284
04:24:57,500 --> 04:24:59,040
Do you know what was the worst?

5285
04:24:59,680 --> 04:25:01,680
All this crap that happened there.

5286
04:25:01,820 --> 04:25:02,300
There we go.

5287
04:25:02,580 --> 04:25:03,980
I thought it was normal.

5288
04:25:04,720 --> 04:25:05,920
And that's how the world works.

5289
04:25:06,000 --> 04:25:07,700
I think if I look at her, she's really quiet.

5290
04:25:09,680 --> 04:25:13,280
One day, I just decided that I couldn't do it anymore.

5291
04:25:16,200 --> 04:25:17,020
I ran away.

5292
04:25:17,800 --> 04:25:18,760
You got this.

5293
04:25:23,070 --> 04:25:25,220
Did you steal something from them?

5294
04:25:26,680 --> 04:25:27,960
What did they do to you?

5295
04:25:28,400 --> 04:25:29,660
Did you run away alone?

5296
04:25:30,740 --> 04:25:32,300
Did you run away with any...

5297
04:25:34,780 --> 04:25:36,300
Any... you know...

5298
04:25:37,340 --> 04:25:38,440
Fellers with you?

5299
04:25:38,560 --> 04:25:39,820
Anyone else that...

5300
04:25:43,380 --> 04:25:45,000
But the guy called her a thief.

5301
04:25:46,240 --> 04:25:47,760
So she must have stolen something.

5302
04:25:47,920 --> 04:25:49,060
Crew, thanks for the five gifts.

5303
04:25:49,380 --> 04:25:50,240
Thank you.

5304
04:25:51,800 --> 04:25:52,600
Any boyfriends?

5305
04:25:55,380 --> 04:25:56,780
What did they do to you?

5306
04:26:01,600 --> 04:26:02,400
Poor girl.

5307
04:26:06,560 --> 04:26:10,160
He's been kind of a thorn in my side, but thank god he's around at the same time.

5308
04:26:12,660 --> 04:26:13,680
He hasn't knocked down our door yet.

5309
04:26:14,140 --> 04:26:16,840
He's probably busy with his crusade.

5310
04:26:17,600 --> 04:26:20,080
I can't imagine a better situation for him.

5311
04:26:20,360 --> 04:26:22,580
Robin, you need to speak up or at least turn the radio off.

5312
04:26:23,800 --> 04:26:24,880
Get her emperor!

5313
04:26:25,160 --> 04:26:25,880
Thanks for the five gifted!

5314
04:26:26,700 --> 04:26:29,280
I hope you can get out of here before you hurt members about me.

5315
04:26:29,620 --> 04:26:30,420
Yeah, me too.

5316
04:26:31,320 --> 04:26:33,400
Okay, let's change the subject.

5317
04:26:33,920 --> 04:26:35,780
Yeah, let's talk about our relationship.

5318
04:26:36,060 --> 04:26:36,780
He ate something.

5319
04:26:37,540 --> 04:26:39,300
Or did I cook all this for him?

5320
04:26:40,320 --> 04:26:43,240
Well, not cooked, but I brought it here.

5321
04:26:43,580 --> 04:26:46,160
Yeah, that's literally what I was gonna say.

5322
04:26:46,360 --> 04:26:47,900
I was gonna say, girl cooked?

5323
04:26:49,100 --> 04:26:49,900
She cooked.

5324
04:26:50,280 --> 04:26:51,320
I'm eating the apple.

5325
04:26:56,380 --> 04:26:57,540
She's poisoning me.

5326
04:26:58,040 --> 04:26:58,440
Maybe.

5327
04:27:01,400 --> 04:27:03,560
No, I think... I don't think Robin will...

5328
04:27:03,560 --> 04:27:04,800
I don't think there's gonna be a twist.

5329
04:27:04,900 --> 04:27:06,920
If there's a twist, it's gonna be the Watcher, right?

5330
04:27:07,380 --> 04:27:08,380
Actually, I have no idea.

5331
04:27:09,200 --> 04:27:11,940
Maybe Robin is the bringer of the apocalypse.

5332
04:27:12,220 --> 04:27:14,540
And the priest is like, I told you so, man.

5333
04:27:16,200 --> 04:27:17,860
Maybe this is all because of her.

5334
04:27:18,340 --> 04:27:20,000
And he was just coming to...

5335
04:27:20,000 --> 04:27:23,760
You know, it's one of those situations where it's like I have to kill her or else the apocalypse will never end.

5336
04:27:26,220 --> 04:27:27,440
We might be the baddies.

5337
04:27:28,160 --> 04:27:28,700
I don't know.

5338
04:27:39,830 --> 04:27:41,230
That would suck.

5339
04:28:01,420 --> 04:28:05,080
No, I'll say, aren't you afraid to be alone?

5340
04:28:05,320 --> 04:28:06,120
If you are, Robin.

5341
04:28:07,020 --> 04:28:08,680
I'm right here for you, baby.

5342
04:28:08,680 --> 04:28:11,100
Who said I'm alone?

5343
04:28:11,860 --> 04:28:13,920
The world is full of people...

5344
04:28:13,920 --> 04:28:15,340
The Vizel thinks you're the five gifted.

5345
04:28:16,640 --> 04:28:20,940
Even in this place, trapped in this hotel, we found each other.

5346
04:28:21,420 --> 04:28:21,920
True.

5347
04:28:22,860 --> 04:28:24,520
And we found the Watcher guy.

5348
04:28:25,340 --> 04:28:26,440
Although he is a bit strange.

5349
04:28:26,440 --> 04:28:27,520
We found each other.

5350
04:28:27,900 --> 04:28:29,380
See, it's working, it's working.

5351
04:28:29,780 --> 04:28:30,660
I'm sure of it.

5352
04:28:31,900 --> 04:28:33,380
We all have our secrets.

5353
04:28:35,200 --> 04:28:37,320
Your problems with communication?

5354
04:28:38,060 --> 04:28:38,540
Nightmares?

5355
04:28:39,600 --> 04:28:40,700
Being infected.

5356
04:28:41,760 --> 04:28:43,400
That's a silly one, though.

5357
04:28:43,460 --> 04:28:44,380
We don't talk about that.

5358
04:28:45,180 --> 04:28:46,520
Lost your parents, right?

5359
04:28:46,780 --> 04:28:52,500
Also, I just noticed these like giant cables coming out from the buildings and like attaching to...

5360
04:28:52,500 --> 04:28:53,820
What the hell are these?

5361
04:28:54,960 --> 04:28:56,900
What are these giant cables?

5362
04:28:58,520 --> 04:29:00,540
When I was in your room...

5363
04:29:00,540 --> 04:29:04,740
I saw the documents from the child protection services.

5364
04:29:05,260 --> 04:29:08,980
Sorry, I was complaining to you about my parents...

5365
04:29:08,980 --> 04:29:10,960
They're power cables, but like...

5366
04:29:10,960 --> 04:29:11,860
Well, you know.

5367
04:29:12,760 --> 04:29:15,900
Do they attach to building to building like that?

5368
04:29:17,780 --> 04:29:19,140
I don't have anyone.

5369
04:29:19,640 --> 04:29:20,720
Maybe that's the problem.

5370
04:29:21,700 --> 04:29:22,400
I'm curious.

5371
04:29:23,020 --> 04:29:24,680
What brought you to the hotel?

5372
04:29:25,360 --> 04:29:28,460
I just have a feeling it's not a fun occasion.

5373
04:29:31,660 --> 04:29:32,060
Truth.

5374
04:29:32,780 --> 04:29:35,140
I wanted to end all my problems at once.

5375
04:29:35,780 --> 04:29:36,100
Lie.

5376
04:29:36,340 --> 04:29:38,560
I was just looking for a place to think about the future.

5377
04:29:39,440 --> 04:29:40,660
I don't want to talk about it.

5378
04:29:41,680 --> 04:29:43,440
She didn't want to talk about it.

5379
04:29:43,560 --> 04:29:45,080
I don't want to talk about it.

5380
04:29:54,020 --> 04:29:54,900
Tell the truth?

5381
04:29:55,040 --> 04:29:55,560
Trust in her?

5382
04:29:58,640 --> 04:29:59,240
Listen.

5383
04:30:00,040 --> 04:30:02,780
I know things don't look good right now.

5384
04:30:03,080 --> 04:30:06,560
But what I want to see is this.

5385
04:30:14,280 --> 04:30:14,880
Sorry.

5386
04:30:17,000 --> 04:30:21,320
I know things don't look good right now, but...

5387
04:30:21,320 --> 04:30:22,700
I just want to say this.

5388
04:30:24,860 --> 04:30:26,700
That kind of sounds like...

5389
04:30:27,860 --> 04:30:28,740
I'm Deku.

5390
04:30:29,260 --> 04:30:31,040
And I'm quirkless.

5391
04:30:31,280 --> 04:30:34,980
But one day I hope to become the greatest hero.

5392
04:30:35,380 --> 04:30:37,460
Just like my idol.

5393
04:30:37,820 --> 04:30:38,520
All Might.

5394
04:30:47,530 --> 04:30:49,110
Especially in this line.

5395
04:30:49,170 --> 04:30:50,390
I couldn't unhear it.

5396
04:30:57,430 --> 04:30:57,970
Lie.

5397
04:31:00,610 --> 04:31:03,150
You value me only because I'm useful.

5398
04:31:03,770 --> 04:31:04,450
My feelings...

5399
04:31:04,450 --> 04:31:06,070
Guys, it's time.

5400
04:31:06,510 --> 04:31:08,670
My feelings go beyond friendship.

5401
04:31:10,690 --> 04:31:13,550
If she rejects me, I can end it all right now.

5402
04:31:16,500 --> 04:31:17,990
I'm also glad that I met you.

5403
04:31:18,290 --> 04:31:19,870
I acted on my own self-interest.

5404
04:31:20,410 --> 04:31:23,910
My feelings go beyond friendship.

5405
04:31:24,150 --> 04:31:24,510
I wonder.

5406
04:31:24,670 --> 04:31:25,010
I wonder.

5407
04:31:25,130 --> 04:31:25,810
I'm so curious.

5408
04:31:26,750 --> 04:31:28,870
Oh, I...

5409
04:31:28,870 --> 04:31:29,670
Thank you.

5410
04:31:30,330 --> 04:31:34,020
I appreciate it.

5411
04:31:34,640 --> 04:31:34,920
Thank you?

5412
04:31:35,060 --> 04:31:37,580
Oh wait, what does that... I appreciate it.

5413
04:31:40,120 --> 04:31:41,280
You know...

5414
04:31:41,280 --> 04:31:43,240
To be honest...

5415
04:31:43,240 --> 04:31:44,420
I'm already blessed.

5416
04:31:45,180 --> 04:31:45,980
That's it.

5417
04:31:46,460 --> 04:31:46,920
That's it.

5418
04:31:46,980 --> 04:31:48,720
Just jump from the ledge right here, buddy.

5419
04:31:53,880 --> 04:31:56,660
You better hope that that banana was poisoned.

5420
04:31:57,100 --> 04:31:58,120
Do a flip, Miki.

5421
04:31:58,120 --> 04:32:00,020
She changed the subject.

5422
04:32:03,420 --> 04:32:05,120
She changed the...

5423
04:32:11,130 --> 04:32:12,090
It hurts.

5424
04:32:17,700 --> 04:32:21,940
I came to this hotel to end all my problems at once.

5425
04:32:22,580 --> 04:32:23,120
Oh, yeah.

5426
04:32:25,080 --> 04:32:25,680
That's okay.

5427
04:32:25,740 --> 04:32:26,620
I'm glad we met each other.

5428
04:32:26,820 --> 04:32:28,040
Actually, I really like you.

5429
04:32:28,820 --> 04:32:30,820
I appreciate it.

5430
04:32:31,000 --> 04:32:31,540
Fail out.

5431
04:32:31,660 --> 04:32:32,240
Fail out.

5432
04:32:37,850 --> 04:32:39,630
Wait, what do you mean before it's all over?

5433
04:32:40,090 --> 04:32:40,710
Are we gonna die?

5434
04:32:41,530 --> 04:32:43,050
How does the rejection feel?

5435
04:32:43,950 --> 04:32:45,310
Tastes like moldy banana.

5436
04:32:48,830 --> 04:32:49,270
No!

5437
04:32:50,650 --> 04:32:52,070
Our food is gone.

5438
04:32:57,410 --> 04:33:00,210
Actually, now I think about it, I think all the monsters inside...

5439
04:33:00,210 --> 04:33:01,170
Well, besides the woman.

5440
04:33:02,150 --> 04:33:03,170
I wonder what she did.

5441
04:33:03,170 --> 04:33:07,730
But all the other monsters that we've encountered are gone.

5442
04:33:07,890 --> 04:33:08,570
There weren't that many.

5443
04:33:08,750 --> 04:33:10,110
There was only like the two of them.

5444
04:33:24,190 --> 04:33:27,130
Why did it get so ominous all of a sudden?

5445
04:33:31,910 --> 04:33:32,590
What's wrong?

5446
04:33:33,670 --> 04:33:34,470
What do you mean?

5447
04:33:34,730 --> 04:33:35,330
I what?

5448
04:33:35,450 --> 04:33:35,930
What's wrong?

5449
04:33:38,570 --> 04:33:39,890
Green ghost is down.

5450
04:33:40,010 --> 04:33:40,830
Someone get a medic.

5451
04:33:41,230 --> 04:33:42,850
Message from the rescue services.

5452
04:33:43,110 --> 04:33:45,670
The request from the Sanity Inn Hotel has been accepted.

5453
04:33:46,030 --> 04:33:48,990
An evacuation of civilians is scheduled for 8pm tomorrow.

5454
04:33:49,150 --> 04:33:49,390
Tomorrow?

5455
04:33:50,110 --> 04:33:54,690
All survivors are advised to make their way to the roof and await the arrival of a rescue team.

5456
04:33:57,490 --> 04:33:58,530
Thank god.

5457
04:33:58,650 --> 04:33:59,590
At least we...

5458
04:33:59,590 --> 04:34:02,170
At least we have our Doritos.

5459
04:34:04,050 --> 04:34:04,530
Tomorrow?

5460
04:34:15,560 --> 04:34:17,380
My rejection has manifested.

5461
04:34:17,800 --> 04:34:19,240
Wait, did she just try to kiss us?

5462
04:34:29,360 --> 04:34:29,840
Guys...

5463
04:34:29,840 --> 04:34:31,360
Um...

5464
04:34:33,420 --> 04:34:36,780
The last day.

5465
04:34:38,820 --> 04:34:39,940
Oh no.

5466
04:34:41,120 --> 04:34:42,840
I pretend not to see.

5467
04:34:47,920 --> 04:34:49,720
Let's just get this over with.

5468
04:34:52,150 --> 04:34:53,720
I hear whispers even.

5469
04:34:55,300 --> 04:34:56,560
Fight it Mint.

5470
04:34:56,700 --> 04:34:57,240
We're fighting?

5471
04:34:57,420 --> 04:34:57,820
We're fighting?

5472
04:35:02,010 --> 04:35:04,410
Hello Galaxy Mama.

5473
04:35:05,550 --> 04:35:06,930
It's even worse than I thought.

5474
04:35:07,010 --> 04:35:08,550
Minto is allergic to goth girls.

5475
04:35:09,070 --> 04:35:10,790
I felt like a static shock.

5476
04:35:12,770 --> 04:35:13,450
Hello...

5477
04:35:13,450 --> 04:35:14,850
Ma'am?

5478
04:35:16,950 --> 04:35:17,390
Huh?

5479
04:35:19,610 --> 04:35:20,290
What?

5480
04:35:23,290 --> 04:35:24,930
Oh my god.

5481
04:35:26,730 --> 04:35:27,910
Oh my god.

5482
04:35:37,090 --> 04:35:38,510
Oh, poor girl.

5483
04:35:39,710 --> 04:35:41,590
She's probably so freaked out.

5484
04:35:43,130 --> 04:35:44,090
I don't think so.

5485
04:35:44,190 --> 04:35:45,250
Something is calling me.

5486
04:35:45,770 --> 04:35:47,650
I guess I was just walking in my sleep.

5487
04:35:48,070 --> 04:35:48,870
Everything is fine.

5488
04:35:48,930 --> 04:35:49,830
Don't worry about it.

5489
04:35:50,370 --> 04:35:52,590
No, I think I gotta tell her.

5490
04:35:53,290 --> 04:35:54,670
I think we have to tell her.

5491
04:36:01,030 --> 04:36:01,510
Yeah...

5492
04:36:07,650 --> 04:36:09,590
I scream in my sleep?

5493
04:36:11,270 --> 04:36:12,390
That's a new one.

5494
04:36:15,250 --> 04:36:16,390
I'm just asleep.

5495
04:36:21,570 --> 04:36:24,390
This is not what I meant by need a medic.

5496
04:36:25,950 --> 04:36:27,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

5497
04:36:27,470 --> 04:36:28,450
How do you know about her?

5498
04:36:28,850 --> 04:36:29,650
Someone talks to me.

5499
04:36:29,690 --> 04:36:30,850
Yeah, how do you know about her?

5500
04:36:31,450 --> 04:36:33,730
You mumble something while you sleep.

5501
04:36:34,490 --> 04:36:36,490
I'm just spilling all my secrets.

5502
04:36:36,790 --> 04:36:37,810
I don't want to mention it.

5503
04:36:38,450 --> 04:36:40,290
I thought you were just having nightmares.

5504
04:36:40,970 --> 04:36:43,590
But something is clearly wrong here.

5505
04:36:43,890 --> 04:36:44,830
Oh my god, I just remembered.

5506
04:36:44,930 --> 04:36:46,610
We have that guy in 311 as well.

5507
04:36:46,690 --> 04:36:47,930
We gotta get that guy out too.

5508
04:36:48,430 --> 04:36:49,210
You're infected.

5509
04:36:49,850 --> 04:36:50,850
Oh god.

5510
04:36:55,070 --> 04:36:56,870
This will never end.

5511
04:36:58,290 --> 04:36:59,810
Rescuers will arrive soon.

5512
04:37:00,450 --> 04:37:00,990
Resculers?

5513
04:37:01,830 --> 04:37:03,390
You want to redo that line, Robin?

5514
04:37:09,410 --> 04:37:12,090
Yeah, I'm not one of those people that's gonna...

5515
04:37:12,090 --> 04:37:13,650
In a zombie apocalypse, it's like...

5516
04:37:13,650 --> 04:37:15,210
I got bit, but like...

5517
04:37:15,210 --> 04:37:16,550
Maybe I'm different.

5518
04:37:19,470 --> 04:37:21,110
Go on without me, Robin.

5519
04:37:22,630 --> 04:37:24,070
Go on without me.

5520
04:37:26,910 --> 04:37:29,070
We'll fly away and tell them nothing.

5521
04:37:29,070 --> 04:37:30,150
Oh my gosh.

5522
04:37:30,810 --> 04:37:32,310
I'll tell them and hope for the best.

5523
04:37:32,890 --> 04:37:33,970
You'll fly.

5524
04:37:34,950 --> 04:37:36,090
And I will stay.

5525
04:37:38,610 --> 04:37:39,730
Oh Robin.

5526
04:37:41,350 --> 04:37:41,950
Robin.

5527
04:37:43,110 --> 04:37:43,710
Robin.

5528
04:37:51,810 --> 04:37:54,750
I mean, if I'm infected, I won't get killed, right?

5529
04:38:00,310 --> 04:38:01,050
True.

5530
04:38:08,430 --> 04:38:09,550
No, wait.

5531
04:38:10,730 --> 04:38:11,270
No, Robin.

5532
04:38:14,070 --> 04:38:14,650
I'm sure.

5533
04:38:21,590 --> 04:38:24,990
Yeah, all two of them.

5534
04:38:33,610 --> 04:38:34,270
Priest.

5535
04:38:40,690 --> 04:38:43,390
I think we...

5536
04:38:43,390 --> 04:38:44,270
Leave that guy here.

5537
04:38:44,670 --> 04:38:46,490
I don't think we should bring him.

5538
04:38:51,670 --> 04:38:52,990
I don't...

5539
04:38:53,690 --> 04:38:54,350
He's...

5540
04:38:54,350 --> 04:38:55,850
I think he's infected.

5541
04:38:56,430 --> 04:38:58,070
He must fly away with us.

5542
04:38:58,110 --> 04:38:59,030
He must not.

5543
04:38:59,130 --> 04:39:00,150
It is not our responsibility.

5544
04:39:08,170 --> 04:39:10,210
I make so much noise when I sleep.

5545
04:39:10,310 --> 04:39:12,550
That one girl remarked, how can you love...

5546
04:39:12,550 --> 04:39:14,590
How can anyone love you when you make that much noise?

5547
04:39:14,710 --> 04:39:14,990
What?

5548
04:39:20,770 --> 04:39:21,170
Yeah.

5549
04:39:22,730 --> 04:39:23,130
Yeah.

5550
04:39:24,330 --> 04:39:24,810
Yeah.

5551
04:39:27,070 --> 04:39:28,090
Yeah, exactly.

5552
04:39:28,350 --> 04:39:30,110
She changed her tune so quickly.

5553
04:39:30,210 --> 04:39:32,610
As soon as I was like, nah, fuck that guy.

5554
04:39:33,230 --> 04:39:34,670
No, my man, Priest.

5555
04:39:41,010 --> 04:39:41,490
Exactly.

5556
04:39:44,730 --> 04:39:46,570
We wouldn't know how to find him.

5557
04:39:47,010 --> 04:39:48,170
That guy is like...

5558
04:39:48,170 --> 04:39:49,470
He's a lone wolf.

5559
04:39:49,950 --> 04:39:51,610
That guy can handle his own.

5560
04:39:51,650 --> 04:39:52,930
He doesn't need to come with us.

5561
04:39:53,410 --> 04:39:55,330
That guy has...

5562
04:39:55,330 --> 04:39:57,370
His own demons.

5563
04:39:57,530 --> 04:39:57,830
Literally.

5564
04:40:04,950 --> 04:40:06,310
He's in the elevator?

5565
04:40:06,490 --> 04:40:08,070
Yeah, we'll just find him in the elevator again.

5566
04:40:13,920 --> 04:40:14,360
Hello?

5567
04:40:14,360 --> 04:40:14,540
Yeah.

5568
04:40:16,740 --> 04:40:17,180
Hello?

5569
04:40:18,140 --> 04:40:18,700
Moshi moshi.

5570
04:40:19,840 --> 04:40:21,300
It's time for us to get ready, kid.

5571
04:40:21,440 --> 04:40:22,380
But I need help.

5572
04:40:23,320 --> 04:40:23,980
Are you infected?

5573
04:40:24,800 --> 04:40:25,000
What?

5574
04:40:25,100 --> 04:40:26,820
No, no, just...

5575
04:40:26,820 --> 04:40:27,900
I'm disabled, kid.

5576
04:40:28,220 --> 04:40:30,020
I can hardly do anything on my own.

5577
04:40:30,260 --> 04:40:34,380
A friend from the army...

5578
04:40:34,380 --> 04:40:35,240
Got me this job.

5579
04:40:36,600 --> 04:40:38,020
He said it's a cushy position.

5580
04:40:38,280 --> 04:40:40,000
Just watch the cameras and call the police...

5581
04:40:40,000 --> 04:40:40,940
If anything happens.

5582
04:40:40,940 --> 04:40:42,320
Oh my gosh.

5583
04:40:43,500 --> 04:40:44,740
His phone guy.

5584
04:40:47,280 --> 04:40:49,680
You can't lift your butt off your wheelchair anyway.

5585
04:40:49,900 --> 04:40:52,020
At least here you'll have something to do.

5586
04:40:54,220 --> 04:40:55,840
And then all this started.

5587
04:40:57,500 --> 04:40:59,220
You've been lying to me this whole time.

5588
04:40:59,320 --> 04:41:00,000
Why are you so angry?

5589
04:41:00,300 --> 04:41:01,340
Why didn't you say anything?

5590
04:41:01,480 --> 04:41:03,900
Because I was scared, kid.

5591
04:41:04,260 --> 04:41:05,200
I'm still scared.

5592
04:41:06,040 --> 04:41:08,680
What if you decide to break into me and take all my supplies?

5593
04:41:08,680 --> 04:41:10,840
What if that crazy holy man does it?

5594
04:41:12,300 --> 04:41:14,260
I was stuck in this damn room.

5595
04:41:14,320 --> 04:41:16,440
On this damn wheelchair and I watched people die.

5596
04:41:16,920 --> 04:41:18,280
I was responsible for them.

5597
04:41:21,420 --> 04:41:24,620
How could I call myself a security guard if I cannot guard?

5598
04:41:25,000 --> 04:41:26,720
I just look at these damn monitors.

5599
04:41:26,860 --> 04:41:27,620
This poor guy.

5600
04:41:29,120 --> 04:41:30,880
Yeah, they would break into his office.

5601
04:41:32,520 --> 04:41:33,800
I wanted to be useful.

5602
04:41:34,200 --> 04:41:35,920
And I tried to be as useful as I could.

5603
04:41:37,500 --> 04:41:38,240
I'm sorry.

5604
04:41:38,360 --> 04:41:39,720
I relied on you so much.

5605
04:41:40,160 --> 04:41:42,260
Yeah, that guy's been sitting there for like a week.

5606
04:41:45,120 --> 04:41:48,420
He probably pooped his pants.

5607
04:41:49,520 --> 04:41:49,960
Realistically.

5608
04:41:50,520 --> 04:41:52,840
And we're gonna have to ride in the same helicopter as him.

5609
04:41:52,900 --> 04:41:54,220
I want everybody to be prepared.

5610
04:41:56,700 --> 04:41:57,140
That...

5611
04:41:57,840 --> 04:41:59,880
He probably doesn't have a bathroom in there.

5612
04:42:01,060 --> 04:42:04,480
And he's probably just been sitting in his own poop for a week.

5613
04:42:10,400 --> 04:42:12,220
I'd rather he say he was infected.

5614
04:42:16,190 --> 04:42:17,610
The smelly watcher.

5615
04:42:18,130 --> 04:42:19,630
You guys just have to be prepared, okay?

5616
04:42:20,290 --> 04:42:21,490
We'll still take him.

5617
04:42:21,950 --> 04:42:23,330
But we have to prepare ourselves.

5618
04:42:25,130 --> 04:42:25,990
For the poopening.

5619
04:42:27,770 --> 04:42:29,370
It's okay, we're helping each other.

5620
04:42:29,550 --> 04:42:31,230
You have nothing to apologize for, I understand.

5621
04:42:31,490 --> 04:42:32,590
How can I trust you now?

5622
04:42:32,990 --> 04:42:34,270
Be glad you're locked in there.

5623
04:42:34,310 --> 04:42:39,890
Otherwise I'd smash your head in with your own wheelchair.

5624
04:42:41,210 --> 04:42:41,730
Oh

5625
04:42:45,120 --> 04:42:46,260
my god!

5626
04:42:47,300 --> 04:42:50,560
I kinda wanna pick it because it's so out of pocket.

5627
04:42:50,920 --> 04:42:52,220
Oh my god!

5628
04:42:52,480 --> 04:42:53,440
I'm a monster!

5629
04:42:56,760 --> 04:42:57,840
Did it save?

5630
04:42:58,020 --> 04:42:59,120
Could I, like, do it?

5631
04:42:59,160 --> 04:42:59,440
Pick it?

5632
04:42:59,520 --> 04:43:00,900
I wonder if he's just like...

5633
04:43:04,100 --> 04:43:05,460
Raiden's inner thoughts.

5634
04:43:07,580 --> 04:43:08,620
Oh my gosh.

5635
04:43:09,060 --> 04:43:11,580
We've been playing the good guy this whole time.

5636
04:43:11,580 --> 04:43:13,420
Sometimes I like to play...

5637
04:43:13,420 --> 04:43:15,300
a little bit of a...

5638
04:43:15,300 --> 04:43:16,720
instigator in these things.

5639
04:43:16,860 --> 04:43:19,120
But we've been playing it pretty good this whole time.

5640
04:43:19,900 --> 04:43:20,300
Yeah.

5641
04:43:22,780 --> 04:43:25,880
Oh my gosh, I wanna be a little...

5642
04:43:26,520 --> 04:43:28,020
ass wipe next time though.

5643
04:43:28,120 --> 04:43:29,960
I wanna be someone who's just such a...

5644
04:43:29,960 --> 04:43:31,000
jerk to everybody.

5645
04:43:34,260 --> 04:43:35,520
You have nothing to apologize.

5646
04:43:35,940 --> 04:43:36,220
It's okay.

5647
04:43:38,540 --> 04:43:39,340
Thank you, Ken.

5648
04:43:39,340 --> 04:43:40,340
Thank you.

5649
04:43:40,740 --> 04:43:43,620
I have one last request and I hope you'll agree to fulfill it.

5650
04:43:45,520 --> 04:43:47,200
Come down here and help me get to the roof.

5651
04:43:47,380 --> 04:43:49,300
I'll open the door so we can finally meet in person.

5652
04:43:49,820 --> 04:43:50,200
Alright?

5653
04:43:53,660 --> 04:43:55,460
What's... Is there anything else you wanna tell me?

5654
04:43:56,280 --> 04:43:56,740
Yes, kid.

5655
04:43:56,800 --> 04:43:57,460
One more thing.

5656
04:43:58,080 --> 04:43:59,040
My name...

5657
04:43:59,040 --> 04:43:59,560
Columbo.

5658
04:44:00,320 --> 04:44:03,460
I saw how you look around the corners while walking through the corridors.

5659
04:44:03,980 --> 04:44:06,240
As if you're talking to someone or seeing those...

5660
04:44:06,240 --> 04:44:07,960
Seeing those who aren't there.

5661
04:44:07,960 --> 04:44:08,260
Oh.

5662
04:44:10,020 --> 04:44:10,900
You're infected.

5663
04:44:11,560 --> 04:44:12,060
I know it.

5664
04:44:12,580 --> 04:44:13,440
Knew it for a long time.

5665
04:44:15,260 --> 04:44:18,200
But you've been fighting this infection much longer than the others.

5666
04:44:18,540 --> 04:44:20,120
And I believe that you will not give in to it.

5667
04:44:20,500 --> 04:44:22,620
So he knew and still helps us.

5668
04:44:23,740 --> 04:44:27,040
And if you decide not to tell anyone about it, I will remain silent too.

5669
04:44:28,560 --> 04:44:30,240
He actually is such a good guy.

5670
04:44:31,300 --> 04:44:32,840
Because I trust in you.

5671
04:44:32,840 --> 04:44:33,240
Oh.

5672
04:44:36,380 --> 04:44:37,840
See you soon.

5673
04:44:38,040 --> 04:44:38,460
Wow.

5674
04:44:39,840 --> 04:44:40,720
Okay, Robin.

5675
04:44:40,860 --> 04:44:41,640
You listen...

5676
04:44:41,640 --> 04:44:44,640
She's probably right on top of me.

5677
04:44:44,940 --> 04:44:47,320
Breathing down my neck listening to these conversations.

5678
04:44:53,060 --> 04:44:54,840
I just realized...

5679
04:44:55,460 --> 04:44:56,600
On the rooftop...

5680
04:44:56,600 --> 04:44:58,380
To get to the roof roof area...

5681
04:44:58,380 --> 04:44:59,460
It's all stairs.

5682
04:44:59,460 --> 04:45:00,940
How are we gonna move him?

5683
04:45:02,480 --> 04:45:03,720
Still should've picked 4.

5684
04:45:03,880 --> 04:45:04,500
I know.

5685
04:45:07,020 --> 04:45:08,580
I hope that it will never...

5686
04:45:08,580 --> 04:45:10,180
Oh, I lost hope that it will never end.

5687
04:45:10,220 --> 04:45:11,900
I was like, you hope it never ends?

5688
04:45:12,180 --> 04:45:12,960
Robin, what's wrong with you?

5689
04:45:15,920 --> 04:45:16,320
Okay.

5690
04:45:17,580 --> 04:45:18,620
I'll see you down there, Robin.

5691
04:45:19,640 --> 04:45:20,860
I'll see you down there.

5692
04:45:25,150 --> 04:45:26,110
What was that sound?

5693
04:45:28,290 --> 04:45:29,110
Oh my god.

5694
04:45:29,110 --> 04:45:30,330
He was here?

5695
04:45:33,830 --> 04:45:35,330
All the writing is gone?

5696
04:45:36,150 --> 04:45:36,630
Except...

5697
04:45:36,630 --> 04:45:37,910
Mine for some reason.

5698
04:45:39,410 --> 04:45:40,310
Okay, let's go.

5699
04:45:48,120 --> 04:45:49,600
He wasn't here though.

5700
04:45:49,980 --> 04:45:50,680
Oh, yes he was.

5701
04:45:50,720 --> 04:45:51,080
Just kidding.

5702
04:45:56,260 --> 04:45:58,600
Guy made sure to take care of every room.

5703
04:45:58,860 --> 04:45:59,400
Hey, hey buddy.

5704
04:46:01,560 --> 04:46:02,300
Who's there?

5705
04:46:02,980 --> 04:46:03,980
Is that you, young man?

5706
04:46:04,040 --> 04:46:04,680
Did something happen?

5707
04:46:07,000 --> 04:46:08,540
Wow, imagine if I was like...

5708
04:46:08,540 --> 04:46:09,160
Nope, nothing.

5709
04:46:09,380 --> 04:46:10,000
See you later.

5710
04:46:11,880 --> 04:46:13,080
Rescue is on its way.

5711
04:46:13,160 --> 04:46:13,660
Get ready.

5712
04:46:15,980 --> 04:46:18,780
That would be such an asshole move.

5713
04:46:19,240 --> 04:46:19,920
You're not joking?

5714
04:46:20,060 --> 04:46:20,700
That's wonderful.

5715
04:46:21,500 --> 04:46:22,400
I need to prepare.

5716
04:46:22,560 --> 04:46:23,460
Go without me, young man.

5717
04:46:23,780 --> 04:46:24,860
I'll get myself up...

5718
04:46:24,860 --> 04:46:27,300
Or I'll get up myself as soon as I gather my strength.

5719
04:46:28,100 --> 04:46:30,620
And young man, thank you for everything you've done.

5720
04:46:30,620 --> 04:46:31,760
I owe you my life.

5721
04:46:32,520 --> 04:46:35,860
I'm glad there are still people in the world who can be relied upon.

5722
04:46:36,360 --> 04:46:39,420
And I'm fortunate that one of them happens to be my next door neighbor.

5723
04:46:41,440 --> 04:46:41,800
Next...

5724
04:46:41,800 --> 04:46:43,620
We're not next next, but you know.

5725
04:46:44,160 --> 04:46:44,900
I get what you mean.

5726
04:46:45,060 --> 04:46:45,980
This room too?

5727
04:46:46,820 --> 04:46:48,440
This guy is taken care of everywhere.

5728
04:46:49,280 --> 04:46:50,320
How did he get in there?

5729
04:46:52,060 --> 04:46:53,880
Oh, we actually get to take the elevator down.

5730
04:46:53,920 --> 04:46:54,320
That's fun.

5731
04:46:54,940 --> 04:46:56,140
Uh oh, is he gonna be in there?

5732
04:47:03,040 --> 04:47:03,600
Okay.

5733
04:47:04,440 --> 04:47:05,260
Press the button.

5734
04:47:06,560 --> 04:47:10,320
I was expecting like a hand to reach in and stop it.

5735
04:47:10,360 --> 04:47:11,180
There's no...

5736
04:47:11,180 --> 04:47:15,180
There's no vents in this for him to climb through.

5737
04:47:17,460 --> 04:47:18,980
Oh god, here he is.

5738
04:47:19,460 --> 04:47:20,200
The priest!

5739
04:47:29,360 --> 04:47:30,500
Oh my god.

5740
04:47:39,830 --> 04:47:41,110
How did this happen?

5741
04:47:45,150 --> 04:47:46,070
No, no.

5742
04:47:50,500 --> 04:47:52,000
Oh no, no, no, no.

5743
04:48:05,760 --> 04:48:07,620
The priest came for him.

5744
04:48:07,700 --> 04:48:11,080
He was eavesdropping all this time to sneak in here when the door opens.

5745
04:48:12,560 --> 04:48:14,060
Some cameras are still working.

5746
04:48:14,180 --> 04:48:15,020
This is my corridor.

5747
04:48:18,180 --> 04:48:19,040
Oh no!

5748
04:48:22,460 --> 04:48:24,100
He's taking her upstairs.

5749
04:48:28,990 --> 04:48:30,110
Oh buddy.

5750
04:48:32,410 --> 04:48:33,370
Oh buddy.

5751
04:48:34,930 --> 04:48:36,290
Eating them beans.

5752
04:48:36,810 --> 04:48:37,870
There's reeks in here.

5753
04:48:39,350 --> 04:48:40,550
Hello my son.

5754
04:48:41,830 --> 04:48:43,030
What do you want?

5755
04:48:43,670 --> 04:48:45,410
I want to meet and talk.

5756
04:48:46,710 --> 04:48:50,230
You are going to run away from the wrath of god, but I can't allow that.

5757
04:48:51,290 --> 04:48:52,670
Sinners must be punished.

5758
04:48:54,170 --> 04:48:56,630
If you want her to survive, go up to the roof.

5759
04:48:57,250 --> 04:48:59,530
We have a serious conversation ahead of us.

5760
04:49:02,810 --> 04:49:03,410
No.

5761
04:49:05,930 --> 04:49:08,050
How do you see anything on these?

5762
04:49:08,510 --> 04:49:10,070
They are flipping so fast.

5763
04:49:12,150 --> 04:49:14,350
Oh, he's just an old man.

5764
04:49:18,870 --> 04:49:20,730
He's just an old guy.

5765
04:49:22,250 --> 04:49:24,190
Oh man, take the weapon.

5766
04:49:24,810 --> 04:49:26,610
He has nothing I can take it seems.

5767
04:49:30,090 --> 04:49:32,290
It doesn't seem like I can take anything.

5768
04:49:32,290 --> 04:49:32,790
Sorry.

5769
04:49:34,610 --> 04:49:35,210
No!

5770
04:49:36,070 --> 04:49:36,850
How did he...

5771
04:49:36,850 --> 04:49:38,150
It's so frustrating.

5772
04:49:41,190 --> 04:49:44,930
I wonder if I made the wrong decision somewhere.

5773
04:49:45,370 --> 04:49:46,450
Like if we can save him.

5774
04:49:48,410 --> 04:49:49,830
Ready your bubblegum.

5775
04:49:49,950 --> 04:49:51,350
Or are you going to rizz up the priest?

5776
04:49:55,710 --> 04:49:56,310
Alrighty.

5777
04:49:57,290 --> 04:49:58,090
Press the button.

5778
04:50:04,750 --> 04:50:05,890
It's so sad.

5779
04:50:06,750 --> 04:50:07,570
Give him the gum.

5780
04:50:09,010 --> 04:50:10,590
You're not you when you're hangry.

5781
04:50:11,350 --> 04:50:12,090
Oh my god.

5782
04:50:12,250 --> 04:50:13,590
Oh my god, that scared me.

5783
04:50:14,270 --> 04:50:14,410
Hello?

5784
04:50:15,110 --> 04:50:16,070
Why are you going up?

5785
04:50:16,110 --> 04:50:16,970
He will kill you.

5786
04:50:18,150 --> 04:50:19,150
I need to save her.

5787
04:50:20,570 --> 04:50:21,410
Leave me alone!

5788
04:50:22,570 --> 04:50:24,510
Oh, you can tell me whatever you want.

5789
04:50:24,710 --> 04:50:25,310
I won't leave.

5790
04:50:25,410 --> 04:50:26,390
I'm faithful to you.

5791
04:50:26,870 --> 04:50:29,310
Oh my god, she's multiplying.

5792
04:50:29,710 --> 04:50:30,890
They all got what they deserve.

5793
04:50:30,890 --> 04:50:32,730
Their lies led to this.

5794
04:50:33,050 --> 04:50:34,470
And you made everything worse.

5795
04:50:35,550 --> 04:50:37,270
You risked yourself to get their approval.

5796
04:50:37,730 --> 04:50:39,030
I like how it's now question marks.

5797
04:50:39,130 --> 04:50:39,850
It's not the voice.

5798
04:50:41,030 --> 04:50:42,950
Don't let yourself get attached to someone.

5799
04:50:43,710 --> 04:50:45,030
And now you will suffer.

5800
04:50:47,390 --> 04:50:48,130
Don't answer.

5801
04:50:49,610 --> 04:50:50,610
You know I'm right.

5802
04:50:50,950 --> 04:50:52,690
You'll either die or end up alone.

5803
04:50:54,050 --> 04:50:55,850
He's already felt my mark on you.

5804
04:50:56,590 --> 04:50:57,650
He won't let you go.

5805
04:50:58,510 --> 04:51:00,930
Have you ever wondered why you don't see their faces?

5806
04:51:01,870 --> 04:51:04,670
It's not that it's not just an illness.

5807
04:51:05,710 --> 04:51:06,670
A barrier.

5808
04:51:07,470 --> 04:51:10,310
A shield from those who wish to stab you in the back.

5809
04:51:10,630 --> 04:51:11,290
So, everybody?

5810
04:51:13,130 --> 04:51:13,630
Secrets.

5811
04:51:14,410 --> 04:51:14,850
Vices.

5812
04:51:15,910 --> 04:51:16,410
Weaknesses.

5813
04:51:16,690 --> 04:51:17,250
Each of them.

5814
04:51:17,390 --> 04:51:18,930
The girl, the guard, the priest.

5815
04:51:19,530 --> 04:51:21,190
Which of them will stay with you?

5816
04:51:21,670 --> 04:51:22,990
Who can understand you?

5817
04:51:23,810 --> 04:51:24,190
No one.

5818
04:51:24,710 --> 04:51:25,430
No one.

5819
04:51:25,810 --> 04:51:26,350
No one.

5820
04:51:26,370 --> 04:51:27,150
Oh, they're all saying it.

5821
04:51:27,150 --> 04:51:27,590
No one.

5822
04:51:27,630 --> 04:51:27,890
No one.

5823
04:51:27,930 --> 04:51:28,330
No one.

5824
04:51:29,450 --> 04:51:30,490
Except me.

5825
04:51:31,910 --> 04:51:33,710
Got the three stooges up in here.

5826
04:51:33,790 --> 04:51:34,410
Leave me alone!

5827
04:51:34,610 --> 04:51:34,690
Oh.

5828
04:51:38,650 --> 04:51:39,170
Okay.

5829
04:51:40,790 --> 04:51:42,530
I'm getting hungry, guys.

5830
04:51:42,630 --> 04:51:43,910
And it's getting kind of late.

5831
04:51:44,810 --> 04:51:50,850
So I might go grab a snack real quick before we do the final part.

5832
04:51:50,910 --> 04:51:52,110
If that's okay.

5833
04:51:52,110 --> 04:51:52,410
Okay.

5834
04:51:58,010 --> 04:51:58,810
Go quickly.

5835
04:51:59,270 --> 04:52:00,290
Okay, I'll be right back.

5836
04:52:01,510 --> 04:52:02,810
I don't think this is time.

5837
04:52:03,710 --> 04:52:12,730
Just a quick, quick, quick, quick snack break so I can just not be so hungry and then I don't want to go to bed with a full tummy and then I'll have weird dreams about cosmic ladies.

5838
04:52:13,790 --> 04:52:15,310
Or, maybe that's my intention.

5839
04:52:16,210 --> 04:52:16,670
I don't know.

5840
04:52:17,690 --> 04:52:18,610
Okay, I'll be right back.

5841
04:54:29,780 --> 04:54:38,420
Om nom nom Nom nom nom Nom nom nom Nom nom nom Alright!

5842
04:54:39,460 --> 04:54:40,920
Let's go save our girl!

5843
04:54:46,430 --> 04:54:47,110
Look at this.

5844
04:54:47,330 --> 04:54:50,250
You don't have to flip all that this guy is...

5845
04:54:51,110 --> 04:54:52,550
He's just so extra.

5846
04:54:52,710 --> 04:54:53,930
You don't have to do all of this.

5847
04:54:54,010 --> 04:54:54,710
Come on, man.

5848
04:54:55,970 --> 04:54:56,590
Oh, there's a note.

5849
04:54:59,050 --> 04:55:04,030
Nom nom nom Nom nom C.A.

5850
04:55:04,430 --> 04:55:05,170
New guest.

5851
04:55:05,330 --> 04:55:06,010
Oh, wait.

5852
04:55:06,770 --> 04:55:06,810
Hm?

5853
04:55:08,310 --> 04:55:08,790
C.A.

5854
04:55:08,990 --> 04:55:10,610
New guest checked in today.

5855
04:55:10,770 --> 04:55:13,990
The guy came with just one backpack and rented a room for one day.

5856
04:55:14,410 --> 04:55:15,490
There's something strange about him.

5857
04:55:15,710 --> 04:55:16,450
He avoids people.

5858
04:55:16,590 --> 04:55:17,290
He wants to be alone.

5859
04:55:17,450 --> 04:55:18,190
He talks to himself.

5860
04:55:18,510 --> 04:55:19,150
He is quiet.

5861
04:55:19,890 --> 04:55:21,330
He is just like me.

5862
04:55:24,010 --> 04:55:24,490
Whoever...

5863
04:55:24,490 --> 04:55:26,310
Wait, who is writing these notes?

5864
04:55:30,470 --> 04:55:30,910
Yeah.

5865
04:55:32,990 --> 04:55:33,930
He's just like me.

5866
04:55:34,350 --> 04:55:35,330
For real, for real.

5867
04:55:37,010 --> 04:55:38,130
For real, for real.

5868
04:55:38,210 --> 04:55:38,350
Oh.

5869
04:55:39,410 --> 04:55:39,950
Uh oh.

5870
04:55:40,210 --> 04:55:41,630
They flung you all the way over here.

5871
04:55:42,650 --> 04:55:45,670
Gosh, the nudists really did take over this hotel, didn't they?

5872
04:55:46,230 --> 04:55:49,890
Yeah, how would we have gotten the watcher up here?

5873
04:55:50,270 --> 04:55:50,490
Oh!

5874
04:55:53,290 --> 04:55:54,130
I wonder.

5875
04:55:54,490 --> 04:55:55,070
I fear.

5876
04:55:58,490 --> 04:56:01,250
This game reminds me of the Webtoon comic Sweet Home.

5877
04:56:01,850 --> 04:56:04,630
Oh, no one has mentioned that, but I actually...

5878
04:56:04,630 --> 04:56:05,610
I see it.

5879
04:56:05,850 --> 04:56:06,690
I do see it.

5880
04:56:06,750 --> 04:56:13,430
Especially because the people change into like the monsters that they kind of desire.

5881
04:56:13,890 --> 04:56:15,350
Yeah, it does.

5882
04:56:16,650 --> 04:56:17,290
Let her go!

5883
04:56:19,570 --> 04:56:20,850
Sweet Home is a game, right?

5884
04:56:20,950 --> 04:56:21,370
No, no, no.

5885
04:56:21,390 --> 04:56:22,190
It's a Webtoon comic.

5886
04:56:22,650 --> 04:56:24,450
You're thinking of...

5887
04:56:24,450 --> 04:56:26,750
Oh, I guess there was a game called Sweet Home, wasn't there?

5888
04:56:36,590 --> 04:56:38,170
Everything ends, my son.

5889
04:56:39,630 --> 04:56:41,410
Including our acquaintance.

5890
04:56:45,430 --> 04:56:46,410
Robin, are you okay?

5891
04:56:46,590 --> 04:56:47,090
Run away!

5892
04:56:47,410 --> 04:56:48,310
He went mad!

5893
04:56:49,050 --> 04:56:50,890
Oh my god, and your mic finally worked.

5894
04:56:52,110 --> 04:56:53,650
She's supposed to be quiet now.

5895
04:56:55,170 --> 04:56:57,430
Say one more word to her and she will die.

5896
04:56:57,550 --> 04:56:58,070
Oh my god.

5897
04:56:59,630 --> 04:57:03,630
Hey, do you know what's happening on April 24th?

5898
04:57:03,630 --> 04:57:05,150
Party time.

5899
04:57:25,790 --> 04:57:27,190
Oh!

5900
04:57:27,190 --> 04:57:28,590
Condemnation?!

5901
04:57:28,590 --> 04:57:29,990
Repent, my son.

5902
04:57:30,070 --> 04:57:30,890
Oh no!

5903
04:57:31,350 --> 04:57:32,510
Not April 30th?

5904
04:57:33,350 --> 04:57:36,150
No, it was the party on the flyer.

5905
04:57:36,210 --> 04:57:37,310
Was it April 24th?

5906
04:57:43,140 --> 04:57:45,300
What should I repent for?

5907
04:57:45,840 --> 04:57:47,160
Oh, he didn't like that.

5908
04:57:48,940 --> 04:57:50,500
I need bubble gum right now.

5909
04:57:51,480 --> 04:57:53,020
The first sin, my son.

5910
04:57:53,920 --> 04:57:55,260
Collusion with the devil.

5911
04:57:55,260 --> 04:57:57,220
What are you talking about?

5912
04:57:58,580 --> 04:58:00,000
He told you to shut up.

5913
04:58:00,640 --> 04:58:02,220
You don't have to make excuses.

5914
04:58:02,440 --> 04:58:03,280
I know the signs.

5915
04:58:03,760 --> 04:58:06,840
I have seen him many times these days.

5916
04:58:10,230 --> 04:58:14,090
The devil directs you with his words and says what you want to hear.

5917
04:58:14,270 --> 04:58:16,050
And you let him carry you away.

5918
04:58:21,570 --> 04:58:22,590
I've heard...

5919
04:58:22,590 --> 04:58:24,690
Maybe I shouldn't say that I've heard a voice.

5920
04:58:25,690 --> 04:58:26,150
But...

5921
04:58:26,890 --> 04:58:27,810
I don't know.

5922
04:58:29,770 --> 04:58:31,370
He's hearing voices too.

5923
04:58:38,930 --> 04:58:40,370
Also, this looks so epic.

5924
04:58:40,770 --> 04:58:41,810
I like the scenery.

5925
04:58:45,850 --> 04:58:47,090
Oh, my chat froze.

5926
04:58:48,470 --> 04:58:48,730
Three?

5927
04:58:49,790 --> 04:58:51,130
Heard a voice but I've never given into it.

5928
04:58:51,230 --> 04:58:51,990
Oh, he actually liked that.

5929
04:58:52,350 --> 04:58:54,450
You haven't stained your hands with the blood of the innocent.

5930
04:58:55,150 --> 04:58:55,830
Not yet.

5931
04:58:57,190 --> 04:58:59,450
But that doesn't mean you're guilty of something else.

5932
04:58:59,610 --> 04:59:01,170
Oh, you're not guilty of something else.

5933
04:59:01,650 --> 04:59:02,350
The second sin.

5934
04:59:02,810 --> 04:59:03,590
A bedding?

5935
04:59:04,470 --> 04:59:04,930
Blackjack?

5936
04:59:05,450 --> 04:59:06,730
Sorry that I gambled.

5937
04:59:06,870 --> 04:59:08,970
I'm sorry that I placed beds on the...

5938
04:59:08,970 --> 04:59:10,110
on the table.

5939
04:59:11,670 --> 04:59:13,070
You sheltered a runaway thief.

5940
04:59:13,290 --> 04:59:14,750
A traitor to her own family.

5941
04:59:15,810 --> 04:59:17,110
What will you say in your defense?

5942
04:59:30,330 --> 04:59:31,750
She didn't do anything wrong.

5943
04:59:32,130 --> 04:59:33,390
I didn't know anything about it.

5944
04:59:33,810 --> 04:59:35,730
She is guilty but she can repent.

5945
04:59:38,270 --> 04:59:40,290
Isn't his version of repent...

5946
04:59:40,290 --> 04:59:42,150
repenting just...

5947
04:59:43,090 --> 04:59:44,350
shooting them in the head though?

5948
04:59:45,270 --> 04:59:47,210
I don't think any of them repents, right?

5949
04:59:52,480 --> 04:59:53,000
One?

5950
04:59:57,200 --> 04:59:59,560
Betrayal of the family is the gravest of sins.

5951
04:59:59,560 --> 05:00:03,200
Your failure to recognize this makes your offense even worse.

5952
05:00:03,420 --> 05:00:03,700
Uh oh.

5953
05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:04,900
The third sin.

5954
05:00:05,040 --> 05:00:06,520
Fleeing from the holy duty.

5955
05:00:09,580 --> 05:00:11,440
I gave you a chance to survive.

5956
05:00:12,060 --> 05:00:13,040
You might not have noticed it.

5957
05:00:13,300 --> 05:00:15,080
But I tried to guide you on the right path.

5958
05:00:18,180 --> 05:00:20,880
I would have liked to see a person like you by my side.

5959
05:00:21,080 --> 05:00:22,620
To assist me in God's work.

5960
05:00:24,920 --> 05:00:27,160
And you decided to run away with the rest.

5961
05:00:27,160 --> 05:00:29,260
Just become another sheep in the flock.

5962
05:00:29,520 --> 05:00:32,740
I had no idea of your grand plans.

5963
05:00:35,600 --> 05:00:37,000
Wait, how do you know this?

5964
05:00:37,260 --> 05:00:39,140
There is no sin in being close to people.

5965
05:00:39,560 --> 05:00:41,720
I understand people and that's why I keep my distance.

5966
05:00:42,320 --> 05:00:45,320
I'll stay with you and help if you let her go.

5967
05:00:46,360 --> 05:00:47,700
Oh, this one is hard.

5968
05:01:04,080 --> 05:01:06,100
How do you know this though?

5969
05:01:06,180 --> 05:01:07,060
How does he know it?

5970
05:01:12,220 --> 05:01:14,740
But also, there is no sin in being close to people.

5971
05:01:15,780 --> 05:01:16,440
Let's do two.

5972
05:01:17,020 --> 05:01:17,920
Oh, he didn't like that.

5973
05:01:18,060 --> 05:01:19,780
There is no sin in being close to honest people.

5974
05:01:20,260 --> 05:01:21,900
But where do you see honest people?

5975
05:01:25,740 --> 05:01:28,180
Guys, I messed up!

5976
05:01:29,360 --> 05:01:30,280
Kneel my son.

5977
05:01:30,560 --> 05:01:31,780
It's time to say goodbye.

5978
05:01:37,820 --> 05:01:38,940
Are you ready?

5979
05:01:38,940 --> 05:01:39,020
Mommy!

5980
05:01:41,800 --> 05:01:42,720
I'm with you.

5981
05:01:42,840 --> 05:01:43,900
I'm always with you.

5982
05:01:44,300 --> 05:01:45,440
Let me in and I'll help.

5983
05:01:47,140 --> 05:01:47,860
Kill him?

5984
05:01:49,300 --> 05:01:50,000
No, no, no.

5985
05:01:50,200 --> 05:01:50,760
Close eyes.

5986
05:01:51,580 --> 05:01:52,680
I mean, I could kill him.

5987
05:01:55,680 --> 05:01:56,120
Good.

5988
05:01:57,260 --> 05:01:58,780
I think we got the bad end.

5989
05:02:04,440 --> 05:02:05,460
That scared me.

5990
05:02:09,960 --> 05:02:11,640
Oh no, we have to go through this again?

5991
05:02:16,200 --> 05:02:16,900
Hold on.

5992
05:02:18,220 --> 05:02:19,540
I messed up.

5993
05:02:22,080 --> 05:02:23,540
Let me refresh my YouTube.

5994
05:02:29,920 --> 05:02:35,700
I don't know why my chat freezes every stream.

5995
05:02:44,970 --> 05:02:46,250
He's gonna kill you.

5996
05:02:47,370 --> 05:02:48,130
Don't answer.

5997
05:02:49,250 --> 05:02:50,150
Don't ignore me.

5998
05:02:50,170 --> 05:02:51,050
You know I'm here.

5999
05:02:52,790 --> 05:02:53,930
They all got what they deserved.

6000
05:02:54,550 --> 05:02:55,450
You risked yourself.

6001
05:02:57,590 --> 05:02:59,150
I could still help her.

6002
05:03:00,410 --> 05:03:02,090
If you fail, both of you will die.

6003
05:03:02,310 --> 05:03:04,690
If you save her, she will leave you and break your heart.

6004
05:03:04,950 --> 05:03:05,670
Just like before.

6005
05:03:06,670 --> 05:03:08,070
He's already felt my mark on you.

6006
05:03:08,230 --> 05:03:08,350
Okay.

6007
05:03:14,610 --> 05:03:15,050
Okay.

6008
05:03:16,250 --> 05:03:16,690
Okay.

6009
05:03:16,690 --> 05:03:17,250
Let's go baby.

6010
05:03:18,530 --> 05:03:18,970
Alright.

6011
05:03:27,180 --> 05:03:29,400
I know I should have used my gum on the lady.

6012
05:03:29,960 --> 05:03:32,740
Had I known that you can't use your gum on the priest.

6013
05:03:34,180 --> 05:03:36,420
He doesn't have a sweet tooth you guys.

6014
05:03:44,930 --> 05:03:47,070
Chat freezes because chat is way too cool.

6015
05:03:51,140 --> 05:03:52,520
Everything ends my son.

6016
05:03:53,100 --> 05:03:54,120
Including our acquaintance.

6017
05:03:54,440 --> 05:03:55,840
I'll just say I came here to talk.

6018
05:03:56,540 --> 05:03:56,740
Good.

6019
05:03:56,880 --> 05:03:58,160
We have something to discuss.

6020
05:04:03,060 --> 05:04:04,880
Patience is not my virtue my child.

6021
05:04:04,980 --> 05:04:05,740
Don't test it.

6022
05:04:07,180 --> 05:04:09,180
I have worked hard for the glory.

6023
05:04:10,260 --> 05:04:11,460
My work is not done.

6024
05:04:11,560 --> 05:04:12,320
One confession.

6025
05:04:13,120 --> 05:04:13,520
Repent.

6026
05:04:15,060 --> 05:04:16,180
What should I repent for?

6027
05:04:16,380 --> 05:04:17,360
Oh, he hated that.

6028
05:04:18,380 --> 05:04:18,980
I forgot.

6029
05:04:19,460 --> 05:04:20,700
I thought that was what I was supposed to do.

6030
05:04:20,820 --> 05:04:21,720
Collusion with the devil.

6031
05:04:23,020 --> 05:04:23,340
No.

6032
05:04:23,540 --> 05:04:24,360
I forgot.

6033
05:04:24,700 --> 05:04:25,140
Oh god.

6034
05:04:25,240 --> 05:04:26,380
We are going to...

6035
05:04:26,380 --> 05:04:26,680
No.

6036
05:04:26,800 --> 05:04:27,120
I forgot.

6037
05:04:28,480 --> 05:04:29,060
That's why.

6038
05:04:29,140 --> 05:04:29,460
I forgot.

6039
05:04:32,460 --> 05:04:33,040
It's okay.

6040
05:04:39,780 --> 05:04:41,040
Where did we pick this one?

6041
05:04:47,120 --> 05:04:47,640
Yeah.

6042
05:04:47,760 --> 05:04:49,660
You haven't stained your hands.

6043
05:04:50,420 --> 05:04:50,960
For bedding.

6044
05:04:54,480 --> 05:04:55,540
I think it's three.

6045
05:04:55,660 --> 05:04:56,920
She is guilty but she can repent.

6046
05:04:57,940 --> 05:04:58,460
See?

6047
05:04:59,000 --> 05:04:59,580
I told you.

6048
05:04:59,640 --> 05:05:01,180
You guys chose one last time.

6049
05:05:04,320 --> 05:05:07,440
You allowed her to escape punishment simply because you hoped for her repentance.

6050
05:05:08,180 --> 05:05:09,820
I'm not guilty of anything.

6051
05:05:10,320 --> 05:05:12,120
It's this church that was exploiting us.

6052
05:05:13,580 --> 05:05:15,060
You disappoint me.

6053
05:05:16,020 --> 05:05:16,660
The third sin.

6054
05:05:17,060 --> 05:05:18,320
Fleeing from the holy duty.

6055
05:05:18,960 --> 05:05:20,140
I gave you a chance to survive.

6056
05:05:20,440 --> 05:05:21,720
You are on the right path.

6057
05:05:29,020 --> 05:05:30,200
What did I do before?

6058
05:05:30,480 --> 05:05:31,260
The no sin.

6059
05:05:31,760 --> 05:05:32,800
Being close to people.

6060
05:05:38,700 --> 05:05:39,800
I did two.

6061
05:05:44,380 --> 05:05:44,940
Yeah.

6062
05:05:44,980 --> 05:05:45,920
He didn't like two.

6063
05:05:50,240 --> 05:05:52,040
How do you know this?

6064
05:05:56,330 --> 05:05:58,250
You can't hide from our heavenly father.

6065
05:05:58,630 --> 05:06:00,070
He revealed your secrets to me.

6066
05:06:00,910 --> 05:06:03,510
I picked up the phone and I listened to your conversations.

6067
05:06:06,630 --> 05:06:08,350
Answer the question my son.

6068
05:06:11,970 --> 05:06:13,890
Do I sacrifice myself?

6069
05:06:16,390 --> 05:06:17,570
Oh no!

6070
05:06:19,270 --> 05:06:20,190
What's happening?

6071
05:06:20,670 --> 05:06:22,710
He's going to sacrifice himself.

6072
05:06:29,590 --> 05:06:30,510
Oh no!

6073
05:06:30,610 --> 05:06:31,150
Two or three.

6074
05:06:31,390 --> 05:06:32,530
A lot of you guys are saying two.

6075
05:06:33,750 --> 05:06:34,590
Okay I'll try two.

6076
05:06:35,550 --> 05:06:36,230
Oh he likes it.

6077
05:06:36,550 --> 05:06:37,230
Of course he does.

6078
05:06:37,490 --> 05:06:38,890
A worthy start but it's not enough.

6079
05:06:39,550 --> 05:06:41,290
Knowledge imposes responsibilities.

6080
05:06:45,600 --> 05:06:46,100
Yay!

6081
05:06:47,420 --> 05:06:48,680
I am in doubt my son.

6082
05:06:49,020 --> 05:06:55,860
You walked a worthy path but the voice of god commands me to carry out his punishment and his word is the law.

6083
05:06:56,960 --> 05:06:57,560
Forgive me.

6084
05:07:00,100 --> 05:07:02,180
How do you know that god is speaking to you?

6085
05:07:02,860 --> 05:07:04,100
Foolish question my son.

6086
05:07:04,380 --> 05:07:05,420
He knows all our secrets.

6087
05:07:05,700 --> 05:07:06,680
His words come true.

6088
05:07:06,800 --> 05:07:07,860
How can I not believe him?

6089
05:07:09,140 --> 05:07:11,920
You taught me yourself that you can't trust anyone.

6090
05:07:13,140 --> 05:07:15,420
But who could he be if not our father?

6091
05:07:16,880 --> 05:07:17,760
He guides me.

6092
05:07:18,080 --> 05:07:19,900
He's allowing me to carry out his justice.

6093
05:07:20,240 --> 05:07:23,660
Oh we're like... we're the table.

6094
05:07:23,800 --> 05:07:25,360
We're turntabling him.

6095
05:07:26,380 --> 05:07:28,260
He preaches what I've known all along.

6096
05:07:31,120 --> 05:07:33,740
Isn't it the devil who tells what people want to hear?

6097
05:07:38,200 --> 05:07:42,180
Isn't it the devil who tells what people want to hear?

6098
05:07:42,700 --> 05:07:47,200
That's true but I've waited for this moment all my life.

6099
05:07:48,180 --> 05:07:49,620
I prayed for him to answer me.

6100
05:07:50,720 --> 05:07:52,980
I wanted to be his chosen one.

6101
05:07:57,300 --> 05:07:59,880
I trusted a deceiver.

6102
05:08:02,040 --> 05:08:03,620
There's only one way out.

6103
05:08:03,620 --> 05:08:04,560
Oh!

6104
05:08:17,320 --> 05:08:19,520
Forgive yourself and others.

6105
05:08:20,080 --> 05:08:21,900
No, this time I won't listen.

6106
05:08:22,380 --> 05:08:23,580
Sorry guys I have hiccups.

6107
05:08:27,430 --> 05:08:29,090
I'm trying not to hiccup.

6108
05:08:34,470 --> 05:08:36,410
This time I won't listen to you.

6109
05:08:38,310 --> 05:08:40,750
I've had enough strength to judge others.

6110
05:08:41,130 --> 05:08:43,570
I have enough strength to judge myself.

6111
05:08:44,570 --> 05:08:47,890
And if others don't deserve forgiveness then... Oh damn!

6112
05:08:48,490 --> 05:08:49,290
The priest!

6113
05:08:50,070 --> 05:08:53,970
May each be repaid according to his deeds.

6114
05:09:02,370 --> 05:09:04,470
I got an achievement.

6115
05:09:04,830 --> 05:09:07,670
I convinced the priest to let me live.

6116
05:09:09,130 --> 05:09:09,650
Oh!

6117
05:09:11,910 --> 05:09:12,790
The priest!

6118
05:09:16,860 --> 05:09:18,640
Wow, they built that so fast.

6119
05:09:21,080 --> 05:09:22,660
Do you trust people?

6120
05:09:24,980 --> 05:09:26,280
Wait, where do I go from here?

6121
05:09:26,680 --> 05:09:27,120
This way?

6122
05:09:27,940 --> 05:09:28,260
Oh yeah.

6123
05:09:29,720 --> 05:09:30,360
Oh my god!

6124
05:09:35,100 --> 05:09:37,120
You can see his face though.

6125
05:09:37,740 --> 05:09:39,500
Oh my god, you can see his face.

6126
05:09:39,600 --> 05:09:41,380
Alexander, thanks for the tank gifted!

6127
05:09:42,840 --> 05:09:44,100
Under the sea.

6128
05:09:45,200 --> 05:09:46,660
Under the sea.

6129
05:09:47,540 --> 05:09:48,280
Oh, what's this one?

6130
05:09:49,700 --> 05:09:50,780
That's another tentacle.

6131
05:09:52,660 --> 05:09:53,040
I think.

6132
05:09:53,640 --> 05:09:54,340
Or is that the eel?

6133
05:09:56,240 --> 05:09:57,920
I am voice.

6134
05:10:02,930 --> 05:10:03,990
He's so cute.

6135
05:10:06,230 --> 05:10:12,110
I'm just a little eel in this apocalypse dream world.

6136
05:10:12,470 --> 05:10:14,030
I don't know why I'm even here.

6137
05:10:14,110 --> 05:10:14,930
I'm just an eel.

6138
05:10:17,030 --> 05:10:21,910
What is the point of my existence if I only exist in the dream realm?

6139
05:10:22,230 --> 05:10:23,050
I'm an eel.

6140
05:10:27,750 --> 05:10:29,370
This is so creepy.

6141
05:10:29,370 --> 05:10:32,350
Oh, him.

6142
05:10:32,890 --> 05:10:33,890
The watcher.

6143
05:10:34,930 --> 05:10:35,890
Oh, it's a telephone.

6144
05:10:39,660 --> 05:10:40,700
Pick up the phone.

6145
05:10:43,260 --> 05:10:44,220
I'm disabled.

6146
05:10:44,340 --> 05:10:45,600
I've watched people die.

6147
05:10:46,060 --> 05:10:47,620
Why is that his line?

6148
05:10:47,700 --> 05:10:48,800
That's so sad.

6149
05:10:50,300 --> 05:10:53,000
We're back in the hotel, but I don't think we really are.

6150
05:10:53,760 --> 05:10:54,800
Did this guy get out?

6151
05:10:55,360 --> 05:10:56,160
I hope so.

6152
05:11:00,370 --> 05:11:01,850
People in here are having a party.

6153
05:11:02,970 --> 05:11:03,710
Let's go.

6154
05:11:04,490 --> 05:11:06,010
It's like when we first got to the hotel.

6155
05:11:09,660 --> 05:11:11,420
I hear static in there.

6156
05:11:13,040 --> 05:11:13,700
No!

6157
05:11:14,660 --> 05:11:16,780
They graffitied over her alien.

6158
05:11:20,960 --> 05:11:23,320
I didn't like it.

6159
05:11:23,540 --> 05:11:24,620
I like how it's winking.

6160
05:11:25,780 --> 05:11:27,380
It's like, I'm an alien.

6161
05:11:29,580 --> 05:11:31,380
They ruined it.

6162
05:11:32,040 --> 05:11:34,580
Oh my god, they graffitied over my stuff too.

6163
05:11:35,580 --> 05:11:38,680
Wait, but this isn't where we had written it.

6164
05:11:38,780 --> 05:11:42,140
The note tongue was after our creepy writing.

6165
05:11:44,860 --> 05:11:46,640
Okay, 305.

6166
05:11:46,760 --> 05:11:47,360
We get it.

6167
05:11:48,100 --> 05:11:50,260
What happens now?

6168
05:11:51,140 --> 05:11:51,920
Good question.

6169
05:11:52,580 --> 05:11:53,480
I guess we drown.

6170
05:11:55,200 --> 05:11:56,400
She's here.

6171
05:11:57,420 --> 05:11:59,520
Hello, mom.

6172
05:12:01,820 --> 05:12:03,200
Welcome back.

6173
05:12:04,760 --> 05:12:05,660
Have a seat.

6174
05:12:06,860 --> 05:12:08,660
You must be tired, aren't you?

6175
05:12:09,800 --> 05:12:11,200
Would you like me to make some tea?

6176
05:12:11,340 --> 05:12:12,220
That would be great.

6177
05:12:15,160 --> 05:12:15,960
Sit down.

6178
05:12:18,160 --> 05:12:19,120
Just gonna sit.

6179
05:12:19,820 --> 05:12:20,400
Well done.

6180
05:12:20,700 --> 05:12:21,140
Relax.

6181
05:12:21,420 --> 05:12:23,060
There's nothing for you to worry about here.

6182
05:12:23,860 --> 05:12:28,980
I wanted to talk to you like this, directly, for so long, but your mind is such a stubborn thing.

6183
05:12:29,840 --> 05:12:31,640
It doesn't let anyone in.

6184
05:12:31,980 --> 05:12:37,220
It took a very long time before I could gather all the pieces to truly understand you.

6185
05:12:38,100 --> 05:12:42,180
And now, when we can really talk, I have an offer for you.

6186
05:12:43,140 --> 05:12:45,380
But first, I want to dispel your doubts.

6187
05:12:49,700 --> 05:12:50,980
What is happening to this world?

6188
05:12:51,100 --> 05:12:52,000
Are you in my head?

6189
05:12:52,120 --> 05:12:53,180
Why are you killing people?

6190
05:12:53,380 --> 05:12:54,540
What do you want from me?

6191
05:12:59,200 --> 05:13:00,920
I think I...

6192
05:13:03,860 --> 05:13:04,900
You want to know about one?

6193
05:13:05,060 --> 05:13:06,200
Okay, what's happening to the world?

6194
05:13:09,840 --> 05:13:11,760
I'm bringing a piece of my home with me.

6195
05:13:12,080 --> 05:13:13,640
I feel unwell without it.

6196
05:13:13,940 --> 05:13:15,220
Don't worry, it's a minor thing.

6197
05:13:15,420 --> 05:13:16,300
You'll get used to it.

6198
05:13:21,700 --> 05:13:22,500
No Artoons!

6199
05:13:24,400 --> 05:13:25,880
Oh, we get to ask all of these.

6200
05:13:25,960 --> 05:13:26,880
Why are you killing people?

6201
05:13:28,020 --> 05:13:29,120
I never harmed anyone.

6202
05:13:29,280 --> 05:13:30,760
All I do is bring love.

6203
05:13:31,720 --> 05:13:35,360
My friends simply stop those who prevent it from spreading.

6204
05:13:43,280 --> 05:13:45,220
Are you in my head?

6205
05:13:46,040 --> 05:13:46,640
Not quite.

6206
05:13:46,980 --> 05:13:48,360
I'm very far away.

6207
05:13:49,540 --> 05:13:52,120
But I can connect with those who are ready to answer me.

6208
05:13:52,880 --> 05:13:55,020
Some allow me to come and visit them.

6209
05:14:01,270 --> 05:14:02,210
Holy moly.

6210
05:14:02,830 --> 05:14:04,090
What do you want from me?

6211
05:14:05,090 --> 05:14:06,370
I don't want anything from you.

6212
05:14:06,630 --> 05:14:08,490
On the contrary, I want to help you.

6213
05:14:09,090 --> 05:14:11,010
I'll give you what I gave to others.

6214
05:14:12,350 --> 05:14:12,830
Happiness.

6215
05:14:15,070 --> 05:14:16,290
I came here for a reason.

6216
05:14:16,390 --> 05:14:17,330
At least she kept the couch.

6217
05:14:18,570 --> 05:14:21,410
Eight billion souls are suffering in purgatory.

6218
05:14:22,050 --> 05:14:23,730
How could I turn away from them?

6219
05:14:25,330 --> 05:14:26,670
It is alien.

6220
05:14:26,790 --> 05:14:28,150
She said she was far away, right?

6221
05:14:28,950 --> 05:14:30,090
I can give them happiness.

6222
05:14:30,630 --> 05:14:31,510
To each his own.

6223
05:14:32,130 --> 05:14:32,650
Unique.

6224
05:14:33,850 --> 05:14:35,890
As I've already given to others.

6225
05:14:37,930 --> 05:14:43,710
You turned people into monsters and make them your slaves.

6226
05:14:52,010 --> 05:14:54,070
You turned people into monsters.

6227
05:14:55,010 --> 05:14:57,430
They got what they wanted.

6228
05:14:57,950 --> 05:14:59,690
A new world inside their minds.

6229
05:15:00,110 --> 05:15:01,010
A new body.

6230
05:15:03,730 --> 05:15:04,990
The ability to charm.

6231
05:15:05,410 --> 05:15:06,810
To be part of someone's life.

6232
05:15:06,930 --> 05:15:07,610
To be invincible.

6233
05:15:08,270 --> 05:15:08,970
To punish.

6234
05:15:09,850 --> 05:15:11,090
They felt great.

6235
05:15:13,030 --> 05:15:16,030
Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

6236
05:15:16,770 --> 05:15:18,750
An alien such as you.

6237
05:15:20,270 --> 05:15:21,650
What is a man?

6238
05:15:24,070 --> 05:15:25,230
Until you came.

6239
05:15:26,150 --> 05:15:27,810
Not everyone can be reached so easily.

6240
05:15:28,470 --> 05:15:30,330
Unfortunately, your mind is a stubborn one.

6241
05:15:30,710 --> 05:15:35,050
A rare quirk of perception that was combined with years of trauma and doubt.

6242
05:15:35,670 --> 05:15:39,670
Are you saying I have a quirk?

6243
05:15:43,950 --> 05:15:45,630
That's why you're so important.

6244
05:15:46,070 --> 05:15:51,510
If I become a part of you, I'll understand how to become a part of everyone else.

6245
05:15:55,270 --> 05:15:56,810
Your gifts are not material.

6246
05:15:56,950 --> 05:15:57,630
It's like madness.

6247
05:15:57,750 --> 05:15:59,110
Oh yeah, so what do you want in return?

6248
05:15:59,250 --> 05:16:00,470
Because I am curious about that.

6249
05:16:00,910 --> 05:16:02,750
The opportunity to help others.

6250
05:16:03,030 --> 05:16:04,450
That's all I ask.

6251
05:16:04,530 --> 05:16:05,450
Oh my gosh, she is a parasite.

6252
05:16:05,690 --> 05:16:07,610
She just wants to find other hosts.

6253
05:16:11,510 --> 05:16:14,210
I will wrap everyone in a blanket of dreams.

6254
05:16:14,570 --> 05:16:16,670
I just need to change a couple of things.

6255
05:16:17,730 --> 05:16:19,950
I need to remove those who hinder me.

6256
05:16:20,170 --> 05:16:22,910
I need to prepare the world for my arrival.

6257
05:16:24,630 --> 05:16:26,350
I feel your loneliness.

6258
05:16:27,930 --> 05:16:32,030
Even when you open up to others, they are not able to fully understand you.

6259
05:16:32,650 --> 05:16:33,570
But I can.

6260
05:16:38,190 --> 05:16:39,830
I hear Robin's voice.

6261
05:16:40,430 --> 05:16:42,470
I don't hear Robin's voice, do you?

6262
05:16:43,890 --> 05:16:45,930
I'm not going to trust you either.

6263
05:16:47,850 --> 05:16:49,650
Three, you guys want to go with Robin?

6264
05:16:50,930 --> 05:16:52,730
Because of a coincidence.

6265
05:16:54,070 --> 05:16:56,630
I tried to help you to open your mind so we could talk.

6266
05:16:57,090 --> 05:17:00,070
Unfortunately, it wasn't my voice that you began to hear first.

6267
05:17:01,410 --> 05:17:04,650
But when she leaves, everything will change.

6268
05:17:05,670 --> 05:17:06,490
You're still unsure.

6269
05:17:07,090 --> 05:17:07,950
I see it.

6270
05:17:09,530 --> 05:17:11,770
Alright, let me remind you of something.

6271
05:17:12,510 --> 05:17:14,330
The moment that started it all.

6272
05:17:20,590 --> 05:17:22,830
Are you jealous?

6273
05:17:23,630 --> 05:17:28,530
Are you obsessed with me, galactic mom?

6274
05:17:29,390 --> 05:17:32,410
I hear a heartbeat.

6275
05:17:33,890 --> 05:17:35,390
We're back at the hotel?

6276
05:17:43,240 --> 05:17:45,180
That's how you found her.

6277
05:17:45,800 --> 05:17:46,960
In the hotel.

6278
05:17:47,620 --> 05:17:48,820
How old were you then?

6279
05:17:48,820 --> 05:17:49,780
Five?

6280
05:17:50,220 --> 05:17:50,740
Six?

6281
05:17:51,720 --> 05:17:52,520
No father?

6282
05:17:53,020 --> 05:17:53,960
No friends?

6283
05:17:54,380 --> 05:17:56,820
Communication issues because of your condition?

6284
05:17:58,680 --> 05:18:00,720
There was only her in your world.

6285
05:18:01,140 --> 05:18:04,020
Yeah, I think she is supposed to be my mom.

6286
05:18:04,600 --> 05:18:05,820
Because the white lady...

6287
05:18:06,860 --> 05:18:07,980
She came to her as...

6288
05:18:08,880 --> 05:18:11,180
The voice came to her as her husband, so...

6289
05:18:11,180 --> 05:18:12,740
Then she decided to leave you.

6290
05:18:14,640 --> 05:18:17,960
Wasn't your mother supposed to be that person you could always rely on?

6291
05:18:18,860 --> 05:18:21,700
If she let you down, anyone can let you down.

6292
05:18:23,880 --> 05:18:25,140
Don't you dare talk about her like that.

6293
05:18:25,380 --> 05:18:26,520
You're trying to manipulate me.

6294
05:18:26,840 --> 05:18:28,080
I don't need her anymore.

6295
05:18:28,220 --> 05:18:28,500
Damn.

6296
05:18:33,730 --> 05:18:35,170
You're trying to manipulate me.

6297
05:18:37,190 --> 05:18:40,930
I've never deceived you and never let you down, unlike everyone else.

6298
05:18:41,450 --> 05:18:42,570
Why don't you believe me?

6299
05:18:43,590 --> 05:18:44,850
On one side, goth GF.

6300
05:18:44,930 --> 05:18:46,950
On the other, crazy eldritch mom.

6301
05:18:47,370 --> 05:18:48,110
Tough choice, huh?

6302
05:18:48,110 --> 05:18:48,730
Yeah.

6303
05:18:49,150 --> 05:18:53,730
Only a body in a flooded bathtub.

6304
05:18:55,110 --> 05:18:58,410
I wonder, is that why your dreams are always full of water?

6305
05:19:01,570 --> 05:19:04,950
So remember when he asked about the dreams, we almost said water.

6306
05:19:05,030 --> 05:19:06,090
But is it because of water?

6307
05:19:06,190 --> 05:19:08,290
Because we discovered our mom in the bath?

6308
05:19:08,630 --> 05:19:10,290
That's so messed up.

6309
05:19:11,270 --> 05:19:12,710
You're welcome to membership.

6310
05:19:14,310 --> 05:19:16,270
I know why you came to the hotel.

6311
05:19:18,110 --> 05:19:19,750
You thought about following her.

6312
05:19:21,870 --> 05:19:25,070
If you were ready to leave everything, why not join me instead?

6313
05:19:26,910 --> 05:19:28,570
I'm going back to Robin.

6314
05:19:29,890 --> 05:19:31,290
I'm sorry, but she's gone.

6315
05:19:31,870 --> 05:19:35,430
The helicopter has already arrived and she left you on the roof?

6316
05:19:35,810 --> 05:19:38,010
She wouldn't... she wouldn't.

6317
05:19:38,310 --> 05:19:40,550
Now you only have me... wait, no.

6318
05:19:44,910 --> 05:19:46,230
The time has come.

6319
05:19:47,050 --> 05:19:47,790
She's lying.

6320
05:19:47,830 --> 05:19:48,830
She has to be lying, right?

6321
05:19:50,150 --> 05:19:51,330
There is nothing around you.

6322
05:19:56,510 --> 05:19:58,190
No future, no past.

6323
05:19:58,290 --> 05:19:58,590
Oh, sorry.

6324
05:19:58,770 --> 05:19:59,390
I accidentally clicked.

6325
05:19:59,670 --> 05:20:00,590
There is only me.

6326
05:20:01,230 --> 05:20:02,790
And I can give you everything you want.

6327
05:20:03,890 --> 05:20:05,190
Are you ready to accept me?

6328
05:20:07,370 --> 05:20:08,010
Accept her?

6329
05:20:08,070 --> 05:20:08,190
No.

6330
05:20:08,470 --> 05:20:09,130
Let's go this way.

6331
05:20:16,070 --> 05:20:17,010
Don't leave.

6332
05:20:17,470 --> 05:20:18,550
I'll be with you.

6333
05:20:19,270 --> 05:20:20,050
Excuse me.

6334
05:20:20,230 --> 05:20:20,950
Excuse me, ma'am.

6335
05:20:21,070 --> 05:20:22,390
I don't want what you're selling.

6336
05:20:23,030 --> 05:20:24,870
There is nothing waiting for you there.

6337
05:20:25,170 --> 05:20:25,590
Stay.

6338
05:20:26,050 --> 05:20:27,170
I don't want what you're selling.

6339
05:20:27,550 --> 05:20:28,470
I don't need it.

6340
05:20:30,910 --> 05:20:34,830
Oh my god, she's actually starting to sound like a real creature.

6341
05:20:35,470 --> 05:20:36,250
Oh my god.

6342
05:20:38,990 --> 05:20:43,970
What if I go... oh, it only lets me go in a little certain path.

6343
05:20:45,610 --> 05:20:46,490
She disappeared.

6344
05:20:46,830 --> 05:20:47,630
Oh no, there she is.

6345
05:20:48,550 --> 05:20:48,950
Bye!

6346
05:20:51,570 --> 05:20:54,210
I wonder what happens if you accept her.

6347
05:20:55,710 --> 05:20:58,270
I'm so glad you woke up.

6348
05:21:11,130 --> 05:21:11,870
Put

6349
05:21:15,730 --> 05:21:17,530
the mosaic back.

6350
05:21:17,910 --> 05:21:19,490
That's a Beauty and the Beast moment.

6351
05:21:20,930 --> 05:21:23,970
That's a Beauty and the Beast moment for real.

6352
05:21:25,330 --> 05:21:27,110
Bring the Beast back.

6353
05:21:33,660 --> 05:21:37,240
Excerpts from the diary of the commander of the 3rd Rescue Service Brigade.

6354
05:21:37,800 --> 05:21:38,600
September... Oh no!

6355
05:21:39,660 --> 05:21:43,060
The girl from the Hotel Robin came in today to thank us before leaving.

6356
05:21:43,460 --> 05:21:44,900
She wants to make sure her family is okay.

6357
05:21:45,240 --> 05:21:46,640
The elderly professor was with her.

6358
05:21:46,840 --> 05:21:48,440
Apparently he plans to look after her.

6359
05:21:49,200 --> 05:21:49,620
Oh my god.

6360
05:21:49,840 --> 05:21:52,320
We were flying over the city and noticed several survivors on the roof.

6361
05:21:52,860 --> 05:21:55,860
They say that some young man led them out and left.

6362
05:21:55,860 --> 05:21:56,860
This is very strange.

6363
05:21:56,920 --> 05:21:59,500
Every major city I've heard of has had an outbreak.

6364
05:21:59,620 --> 05:22:01,520
It is no longer possible to contain it.

6365
05:22:01,800 --> 05:22:03,940
We were ordered to take survivors to quarantine zones.

6366
05:22:04,240 --> 05:22:07,740
We were able to save only around 15% of the state's population.

6367
05:22:08,280 --> 05:22:09,380
I pray for us every day.

6368
05:22:09,660 --> 05:22:11,000
I hope that I'll be heard.

6369
05:22:11,160 --> 05:22:14,360
Sorry, I didn't realize that it was changing text.

6370
05:22:22,200 --> 05:22:23,680
Did we stay behind?

6371
05:22:28,630 --> 05:22:32,010
September 24th... I don't think we got a precise date, did we?

6372
05:22:33,590 --> 05:22:34,190
Oh!

6373
05:22:34,470 --> 05:22:35,170
That's it!

6374
05:22:37,950 --> 05:22:40,730
But we... But we beat the illness!

6375
05:22:46,670 --> 05:22:47,270
Lindsay!

6376
05:22:48,730 --> 05:22:49,330
Oh wow!

6377
05:22:52,170 --> 05:22:53,550
You told her to.

6378
05:22:53,750 --> 05:22:54,990
I thought we would change our minds.

6379
05:22:59,640 --> 05:23:00,100
Damn.

6380
05:23:00,540 --> 05:23:02,400
What was this about the elderly man?

6381
05:23:02,480 --> 05:23:03,020
What did it say?

6382
05:23:03,120 --> 05:23:04,220
Sorry, I missed it.

6383
05:23:09,860 --> 05:23:11,800
We lost the girl to save the world.

6384
05:23:11,920 --> 05:23:12,740
We're heroes!

6385
05:23:15,020 --> 05:23:16,160
Man in 311.

6386
05:23:17,460 --> 05:23:19,100
Oh, the professor.

6387
05:23:19,380 --> 05:23:20,600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6388
05:23:20,640 --> 05:23:21,360
We had the guy.

6389
05:23:22,000 --> 05:23:24,260
We had the guy in 311.

6390
05:23:24,700 --> 05:23:25,240
So what?

6391
05:23:25,360 --> 05:23:27,320
311 and her are the only two that escaped?

6392
05:23:28,620 --> 05:23:29,080
Damn.

6393
05:23:32,580 --> 05:23:33,680
What about the other endings?

6394
05:23:33,840 --> 05:23:35,820
I wonder if it will let us...

6395
05:23:35,820 --> 05:23:38,680
I'm just gonna... If I continue...

6396
05:23:40,140 --> 05:23:42,000
I don't really want to go from the elevator.

6397
05:23:43,020 --> 05:23:43,340
OK.

6398
05:23:43,540 --> 05:23:43,780
Oh!

6399
05:23:43,940 --> 05:23:44,560
Good, good, good.

6400
05:23:46,860 --> 05:23:50,880
We can try the ending where we... where we accept her.

6401
05:23:53,440 --> 05:23:54,100
Let's see.

6402
05:23:57,180 --> 05:23:59,680
If you beat the illness, why didn't you go with?

6403
05:23:59,980 --> 05:24:01,120
Yeah, I don't understand.

6404
05:24:02,820 --> 05:24:04,500
We should see what happens if we choose to go.

6405
05:24:04,580 --> 05:24:07,140
That was a long time ago that we chose that though.

6406
05:24:08,540 --> 05:24:08,860
Alright.

6407
05:24:11,160 --> 05:24:12,620
Let's just pick different options.

6408
05:24:12,740 --> 05:24:13,600
I don't need her anymore.

6409
05:24:14,020 --> 05:24:16,560
You're right, but if you chase me away, the loneliness will return.

6410
05:24:16,860 --> 05:24:17,800
It will always come back.

6411
05:24:18,660 --> 05:24:19,060
Oh, whoops.

6412
05:24:19,660 --> 05:24:20,820
I know why you came to the hotel.

6413
05:24:23,280 --> 05:24:24,520
What are you suggesting?

6414
05:24:25,260 --> 05:24:26,100
I've already said.

6415
05:24:26,240 --> 05:24:26,560
Happiness.

6416
05:24:26,860 --> 05:24:27,540
I'll replace her.

6417
05:24:27,980 --> 05:24:28,840
The time has come.

6418
05:24:29,440 --> 05:24:30,120
OK, here we go.

6419
05:24:30,600 --> 05:24:32,220
Let's just accept her and see what happens.

6420
05:24:33,880 --> 05:24:35,620
No option to redo major choices.

6421
05:24:36,100 --> 05:24:36,920
But it's OK.

6422
05:24:38,680 --> 05:24:40,520
No future, no past, no one to rely on.

6423
05:24:41,220 --> 05:24:42,900
OK, let's accept her.

6424
05:24:43,240 --> 05:24:43,960
Let's see what happens.

6425
05:24:44,980 --> 05:24:45,580
Thank you.

6426
05:24:47,100 --> 05:24:48,920
I promise you will be happy.

6427
05:24:48,920 --> 05:24:51,540
If we don't even get to go with Robin, then what's the point?

6428
05:24:52,480 --> 05:24:53,820
Everyone will be happy.

6429
05:24:55,080 --> 05:24:58,080
All that's left is to cut off everything that's in our way.

6430
05:25:04,800 --> 05:25:06,000
Oh my god.

6431
05:25:06,680 --> 05:25:07,520
But we're messed up.

6432
05:25:07,940 --> 05:25:09,220
Oh, but we're really messed up.

6433
05:25:09,900 --> 05:25:10,320
Oh my god.

6434
05:25:11,300 --> 05:25:12,420
Put the mosaics back on.

6435
05:25:19,690 --> 05:25:20,570
We transformed!

6436
05:25:21,670 --> 05:25:24,310
The helicopter is like, nope, nope.

6437
05:25:25,950 --> 05:25:28,650
Distress signal was received from the quarters of the Sanity Inn.

6438
05:25:28,970 --> 05:25:30,570
Rescue helicopter arrived.

6439
05:25:31,050 --> 05:25:32,910
No survivors were found.

6440
05:25:33,510 --> 05:25:34,590
Oh my god.

6441
05:25:38,790 --> 05:25:40,910
They were like, we're out of here.

6442
05:25:44,570 --> 05:25:47,690
The number of attacks has dramatically increased over the past few days.

6443
05:25:47,790 --> 05:25:49,070
We've lost contact with Washington.

6444
05:25:49,270 --> 05:25:51,710
We're currently transporting survivors to the nearest military base.

6445
05:25:51,710 --> 05:25:54,090
We're unsure that where else might be safe.

6446
05:25:54,210 --> 05:25:57,990
There are rumors circulating that nuclear weapons have been deployed on several outbreak areas.

6447
05:25:58,290 --> 05:26:00,230
If this is true, the explosions didn't help.

6448
05:26:00,570 --> 05:26:01,630
The world is in flames.

6449
05:26:02,170 --> 05:26:03,430
We can't hold on.

6450
05:26:06,320 --> 05:26:07,060
Oh my god.

6451
05:26:07,220 --> 05:26:08,820
Not even 15% survival.

6452
05:26:09,000 --> 05:26:11,200
Just the world.

6453
05:26:11,600 --> 05:26:12,500
That's it.

6454
05:26:13,420 --> 05:26:16,680
Today I had a peculiar dream.

6455
05:26:17,040 --> 05:26:19,100
Oh my god.

6456
05:26:19,500 --> 05:26:20,080
Good end?

6457
05:26:20,220 --> 05:26:20,540
No.

6458
05:26:20,540 --> 05:26:24,180
I think that's the least good end.

6459
05:26:29,500 --> 05:26:30,020
Damn.

6460
05:26:32,540 --> 05:26:33,560
Just because you gave in.

6461
05:26:33,600 --> 05:26:34,580
I must have been so special.

6462
05:26:34,800 --> 05:26:38,900
But I remember she said if she learns how to accept me...

6463
05:26:38,900 --> 05:26:40,940
Or learns how to get into my mind...

6464
05:26:40,940 --> 05:26:44,000
Then she would learn how to be into anybody's mind.

6465
05:26:44,100 --> 05:26:45,540
So it seems like...

6466
05:26:46,460 --> 05:26:49,140
Because we didn't give in, then she was like...

6467
05:26:49,140 --> 05:26:52,300
I don't know how to get into everyone.

6468
05:26:52,960 --> 05:26:54,320
So maybe...

6469
05:26:55,140 --> 05:26:57,140
Maybe that's why it was...

6470
05:26:58,280 --> 05:27:00,900
It was the fact that we survived.

6471
05:27:01,120 --> 05:27:04,360
Or if we give in, she's able to take over the whole planet.

6472
05:27:07,140 --> 05:27:07,780
Wow.

6473
05:27:10,160 --> 05:27:12,200
Yeah, we're built different for real.

6474
05:27:15,260 --> 05:27:17,380
That was so fun.

6475
05:27:17,380 --> 05:27:21,760
Oh my gosh, the game has such a good atmosphere.

6476
05:27:22,380 --> 05:27:26,380
Some of the jumpscares were maybe a little cheap, but...

6477
05:27:27,660 --> 05:27:35,820
Overall, I feel like they did a good job with it.

6478
05:27:35,920 --> 05:27:37,200
And the story was intriguing.

6479
05:27:40,900 --> 05:27:43,040
Not really horror so much.

6480
05:27:43,240 --> 05:27:46,080
Yeah, it was more spooky than anything else.

6481
05:27:46,080 --> 05:27:48,080
And I'm glad that...

6482
05:27:48,720 --> 05:27:52,200
None of the... You know what indie horror games always have an issue with?

6483
05:27:52,280 --> 05:27:56,300
Is the monsters, the things that you fight are always like...

6484
05:27:56,300 --> 05:27:58,960
Frustratingly difficult, but here it was like...

6485
05:27:58,960 --> 05:28:01,200
I don't want to say it was too easy, but it was like...

6486
05:28:01,800 --> 05:28:05,320
It didn't feel like I was struggling, you know?

6487
05:28:05,460 --> 05:28:08,080
Like, oh my gosh, I just...

6488
05:28:08,080 --> 05:28:09,600
Is there a way to save the guard?

6489
05:28:09,700 --> 05:28:10,620
I don't know.

6490
05:28:11,700 --> 05:28:12,840
I have no idea.

6491
05:28:18,590 --> 05:28:21,150
Had it in the background, but got really invested at the end.

6492
05:28:23,330 --> 05:28:25,190
They used themes pretty well.

6493
05:28:26,850 --> 05:28:29,910
The choices are not super obvious, you really think stuff out.

6494
05:28:30,050 --> 05:28:30,290
Yeah!

6495
05:28:31,450 --> 05:28:33,710
It actually was very...

6496
05:28:33,710 --> 05:28:36,030
I liked the choices very much.

6497
05:28:36,350 --> 05:28:37,890
It was very...

6498
05:28:38,870 --> 05:28:43,390
I felt like for some of them I could have gone with several options.

6499
05:28:43,750 --> 05:28:44,850
I liked it a lot.

6500
05:28:44,850 --> 05:28:45,490
But...

6501
05:28:46,790 --> 05:28:49,910
This game unironically captures what having a goth GF is like.

6502
05:28:51,970 --> 05:28:53,150
Yeah, we're special!

6503
05:28:54,110 --> 05:28:57,290
Thanks for the stream, I hope everyone gets a goth GF on their own someday.

6504
05:28:57,650 --> 05:28:59,850
Oh yeah, just, you know...

6505
05:29:00,910 --> 05:29:04,030
I know you couldn't get Robin, but...

6506
05:29:04,030 --> 05:29:06,350
Just for the end of the stream.

6507
05:29:08,630 --> 05:29:10,210
Thanks for the stream, Rinto!

6508
05:29:10,510 --> 05:29:13,090
Really fun and intriguing story for an early access game.

6509
05:29:13,090 --> 05:29:14,970
Feels like a finished product already.

6510
05:29:15,530 --> 05:29:17,090
It felt...

6511
05:29:17,630 --> 05:29:20,630
Like they definitely have the story and everything.

6512
05:29:21,490 --> 05:29:25,270
Like I said, there were some graphical glitches sometimes, but...

6513
05:29:26,570 --> 05:29:28,610
It wasn't anything so distracting.

6514
05:29:29,450 --> 05:29:30,570
Joyprincess, thank you!

6515
05:29:32,030 --> 05:29:32,590
Yeah.

6516
05:29:35,430 --> 05:29:37,370
I had a lot of fun, I hope you guys did too.

6517
05:29:37,930 --> 05:29:41,090
I didn't see very many Vtubers playing this one, so...

6518
05:29:42,170 --> 05:29:46,630
Maybe if someone else plays it, they'll do like goofy answers.

6519
05:29:47,990 --> 05:29:51,430
It's hard for these types of games when you're just like...

6520
05:29:51,430 --> 05:29:54,310
Oh, I wanna do the bad answers.

6521
05:29:54,430 --> 05:29:57,570
Because I wanna just be a little jerk, but...

6522
05:29:57,570 --> 05:29:59,550
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

6523
05:30:02,630 --> 05:30:07,330
But then, you know, when you want to see what the good ending is...

6524
05:30:07,330 --> 05:30:09,430
You're like, I gotta choose the good ending, you know?

6525
05:30:11,090 --> 05:30:12,390
Cause chaos can be fun.

6526
05:30:12,550 --> 05:30:13,750
Yeah, I can.

6527
05:30:14,170 --> 05:30:16,570
But today I was like, I'm gonna be a good guy.

6528
05:30:17,050 --> 05:30:18,150
Today, I'm the good guy.

6529
05:30:18,590 --> 05:30:19,070
I'm riding.

6530
05:30:20,570 --> 05:30:22,130
My new Oshi is made like that.

6531
05:30:23,670 --> 05:30:24,190
NOOOOOO!

6532
05:30:27,390 --> 05:30:30,330
But you said I was your Kamiyoshi.

6533
05:30:32,790 --> 05:30:34,970
Good job resisting the bad choices.

6534
05:30:35,170 --> 05:30:35,850
Thank you!

6535
05:30:39,310 --> 05:30:39,830
Yeah.

6536
05:30:40,490 --> 05:30:41,610
This is fun though.

6537
05:30:41,930 --> 05:30:43,830
Thanks guys for hanging out with me.

6538
05:30:43,950 --> 05:30:46,050
I know, like I said, this was a bit of a longer game.

6539
05:30:47,530 --> 05:30:47,950
Oops, sorry.

6540
05:30:48,110 --> 05:30:48,850
I just clicked out.

6541
05:30:49,970 --> 05:30:51,950
But that was a lot of fun to play!

6542
05:30:52,730 --> 05:30:54,350
I hope you guys liked it.

6543
05:30:55,110 --> 05:30:59,150
I will see you guys when I see you next.

6544
05:31:01,450 --> 05:31:01,830
And...

6545
05:31:02,330 --> 05:31:02,710
Yeah.

6546
05:31:03,350 --> 05:31:03,890
Hold on.

6547
05:31:04,090 --> 05:31:06,070
Oh, I forgot something for...

6548
05:31:06,070 --> 05:31:06,690
Here we go.

6549
05:31:08,150 --> 05:31:09,790
Bye or whatever.

6550
05:31:10,570 --> 05:31:10,990
Get out.

6551
05:31:11,070 --> 05:31:11,530
Get out.

6552
05:31:11,830 --> 05:31:12,430
Go home.

6553
05:31:14,230 --> 05:31:14,990
Go home now.

6554
05:31:15,170 --> 05:31:15,570
Get out.

6555
05:31:16,870 --> 05:31:17,590
Get out.

6556
05:31:17,770 --> 05:31:18,090
Get out.

6557
05:31:18,150 --> 05:31:18,470
Get out.

6558
05:31:19,030 --> 05:31:19,470
Bye!

6559
05:31:20,270 --> 05:31:20,850
Bye bye.

6560
05:31:21,090 --> 05:31:21,430
Bye bye.

6561
05:31:21,510 --> 05:31:21,710
Bye bye.

6562
05:31:21,850 --> 05:31:23,090
Bye bye.

6563
05:31:25,450 --> 05:31:25,890
No

6564
05:33:01,720 --> 05:33:02,160
way.

6565
05:33:02,200 --> 05:33:04,400
The Minecraft movie is gonna be on April 4th?

6566
05:33:05,780 --> 05:33:06,280
No.

6567
05:33:08,060 --> 05:33:08,560
No.

6568
05:33:11,180 --> 05:33:15,520
Everything that they keep releasing about it makes me look forward to it less and less.

6569
05:33:16,200 --> 05:33:17,600
Everything is just so bad.

6570
05:33:17,720 --> 05:33:18,600
The skeletons are ugly.

6571
05:33:18,680 --> 05:33:19,600
The zombies are ugly.

6572
05:33:19,680 --> 05:33:20,500
The beaches are ugly.

6573
05:33:20,600 --> 05:33:21,400
The wolves are ugly.

6574
05:33:21,560 --> 05:33:22,600
Everything is ugly!

6575
05:33:24,060 --> 05:33:24,560
No!

6576
05:33:25,800 --> 05:33:28,820
I don't want the Minecraft movie to happen anymore!

6577
05:33:29,000 --> 05:33:29,820
Cancel it!

6578
05:33:30,400 --> 05:33:32,200
Cancel the Minecraft movie!

6579
05:33:32,840 --> 05:33:32,920
No!
