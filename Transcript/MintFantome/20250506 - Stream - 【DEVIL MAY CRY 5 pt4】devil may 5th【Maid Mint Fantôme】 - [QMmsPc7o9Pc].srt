1
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,120
Hello.

2
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,560
How are you doing everybody?

3
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,440
Welcome.

4
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,820
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

5
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,840
To Devil May Cry 5.

6
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,200
Sorry, I was just looking.

7
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,300
Okay.

8
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,420
Hold on.

9
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,560
Look at, look at right here, Dante's head.

10
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,720
The little, the bar that highlights the continue button.

11
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,600
I was like, I was like, why did they make Dante look so weird over there?

12
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,040
Peek-a-boo.

13
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Peek-a-boo.

14
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,740
Mike Wazowski, yeah.

15
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,780
For real.

16
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,580
But, yes, yes, yes, welcome back.

17
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,920
To Devil May Cry 5.

18
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,640
This...

19
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,360
This...

20
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,800
We...

21
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,840
We shall finish today.

22
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,240
Yes!

23
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,280
If, if, if Virgil were to say, where's your motivation?

24
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,500
Okay, you guys, I have to tell you my motivation.

25
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,420
I have to tell you my motivation.

26
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,680
I recently...

27
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
I recently...

28
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,820
Thank you, Joshua!

29
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,740
Thank you!

30
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,620
Yeah, I'm ready.

31
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,240
I...

32
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,600
I recently...

33
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,440
I think it was like, two days ago.

34
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,360
That's how recent.

35
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,640
There was...

36
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,160
There was...

37
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,500
There's a...

38
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,880
A yogurt place.

39
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,260
That opened up near me.

40
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,360
That I found out two days ago.

41
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,480
I don't know when it opened up.

42
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,680
But I found out about it two days ago.

43
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,260
And ever since I was...

44
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,800
Yesterday, I was like, I'm gonna go to that yogurt place.

45
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,280
And then, I forgot.

46
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,260
And so today, I was just like, I'm gonna go to that yogurt place.

47
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,000
But I have to beat the game.

48
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,560
Before it closes.

49
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,200
So, that's my motivation.

50
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,700
It's yogurt.

51
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,720
Cause I really like yogurt.

52
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,900
So, I'm gonna go to the yogurt place.

53
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,800
Yeah, I forgot.

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
I forgot.

55
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,320
But today...

56
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,660
Is yogurt.

57
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,620
Yes!

58
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,060
For the yogurt!

59
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,780
That's my motivation.

60
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,540
My Urizen.

61
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,760
My...

62
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,600
So, we're gonna kick Urgil's butt.

63
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,140
And...

64
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,100
Whoever else...

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,160
Is butt, we have to kick.

66
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,820
That's who...

67
00:06:59,340 --> 00:06:59,820
Yeah!

68
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,540
I'm not...

69
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,200
I don't even know.

70
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,700
Like...

71
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,280
I don't know what the menu is.

72
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,920
But I've...

73
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,000
I've never seen a place like this before.

74
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,140
So, I was like...

75
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,200
I wanna go.

76
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,260
M-Zero, welcome to membership.

77
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,820
Thank you!

78
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,660
Hope everything is okay with you and your friends.

79
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,060
Yeah!

80
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,060
For the other part...

81
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,940
I'd totally be down.

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,000
Um...

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
It's really...

84
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,620
Everybody's schedule is so, so busy.

85
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,800
Mm-hmm.

86
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:31,720
Ugh.

87
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,240
Hold on.

88
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,720
Let me...

89
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,220
I'm trying to scoot my chair.

90
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,100
Okay!

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,160
Yeah!

92
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,340
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,980
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,560
Oh, yeah.

95
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,860
Howdy, howdy.

96
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,720
Welcome in, everybody.

97
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,020
Welcome in...

98
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,520
Hahaha.

99
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,660
It's a silly name.

100
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,180
Welcome.

101
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,080
Thank you!

102
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,340
So, yeah.

103
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,260
Hmm.

104
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,640
Are we ready?

105
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,520
I guess it's...

106
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,300
I guess I feel like I should just jump in, huh?

107
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,020
I feel like I should just jump in, maybe, no?

108
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,140
I just finished MDS1.

109
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,220
I understand now.

110
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,900
No crisp.

111
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
You understand...

112
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,140
A fraction.

113
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,380
You don't understand...

114
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,960
Keep going.

115
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:23,820
You...

116
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,620
Two.

117
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,980
And then you get to two and you're like, whoa.

118
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,280
I need to play three.

119
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Then you're like, whoa.

120
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
I need to play four.

121
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,380
Then you're like, whoa.

122
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,920
I need to play Peace Walker.

123
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,180
The rest is optional.

124
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:37,900
Hahaha.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,860
People have probably asked if you have any plans to play Bayonetta in the future.

126
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,180
Also, IP dog!

127
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,680
Thank you so much for the 10 gift.

128
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,380
Thank you!

129
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,020
Um...

130
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,100
Any game...

131
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,100
For like, most game series...

132
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,860
It's never like a...

133
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,740
Like...

134
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,460
There's only a few...

135
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,200
A handful of games that I have like...

136
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,020
Actual plans to play.

137
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,260
But honestly...

138
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,820
Anything's up for grabs with me.

139
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,320
Hahaha.

140
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,820
If someone asks...

141
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,560
If I have...

142
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,260
Like this goes in full general.

143
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,860
If anybody is ever like, do you have plans to play?

144
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,860
XYZ.

145
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,000
It's really just like a...

146
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,020
It's like a...

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Yeah.

148
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,660
Like...

149
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,980
Not plans...

150
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,040
Plans per se.

151
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,700
But like...

152
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,720
Anything is...

153
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,060
Anything is good to go.

154
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,540
You know?

155
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,360
Sometimes...

156
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,800
Sometimes I'll be like, I have plans to play a certain series or a game or whatever.

157
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,800
But I'm just like, not feeling it in the mood exactly.

158
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
And I'll play something else.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Instead...

160
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
That kinda happened with Half-Life.

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,600
You know?

162
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,100
Like...

163
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,820
I didn't have plans to play Half-Life.

164
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,000
But then I did.

165
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,520
Because it was just kind of like a...

166
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,480
Interest rather than plans.

167
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,060
Yeah, I think that's a better way to put it.

168
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,080
I have interest in pretty much anything.

169
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,700
Hahaha.

170
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,600
Now that you're almost done, how do you feel about the DMC series?

171
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,940
I love DMC!

172
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,880
Hahaha.

173
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,800
But I really wanna know how this ends...

174
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,900
How 5 ends.

175
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,040
Metal Gear Muffin!

176
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,700
Welcome to Mammalshift!

177
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,360
Thank you!

178
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,260
Hmm...

179
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,920
So, uh...

180
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,820
Hmm...

181
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,400
Yeah.

182
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,860
So...

183
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,580
You know?

184
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,620
You can always ask...

185
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,800
You can always ask if I have interest in a game.

186
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,960
I'll be 100% honest.

187
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,880
I'll keep it real with you guys.

188
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,840
I'll keep it real.

189
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,860
You...

190
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,500
Are there...

191
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,400
Like I said though...

192
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,100
I can't think of a single series though...

193
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,960
That I would be like...

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,100
No.

195
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,800
Absolutely not.

196
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,240
I don't know.

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,260
Hmm...

198
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,780
I don't know.

199
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,600
You should play Kingdom Hearts!

200
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,720
Just looked up Sora's VA.

201
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,700
Hahaha.

202
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,400
Hahaha.

203
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,620
Hahaha.

204
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,540
Hahaha.

205
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,020
But right now is not the time to be doing...

206
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,760
Video game...

207
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,700
Talking.

208
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,120
Well, I mean...

209
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,980
I'm playing video game.

210
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
But the video game recommendations...

211
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,520
Now is the time to be playing video game.

212
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,280
So...

213
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,840
Yes.

214
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,520
Yes.

215
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,300
Yes, yes, yes.

216
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,480
Yes.

217
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,640
What did you do, Umi-Neko?

218
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,340
Hahaha.

219
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,460
Umm...

220
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,520
Uh...

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,380
Currently...

222
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,720
No.

223
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,660
Because I would have to read everything.

224
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
Wait, is Umi-Neko fully voiced?

225
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,200
If it is, that's insane.

226
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,800
First of all.

227
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,100
No.

228
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,100
There's no way it is.

229
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,660
I would have to read everything.

230
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,800
And do you think my voice can handle that right now?

231
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,300
Hahaha.

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,920
Heck no.

233
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,140
It is?

234
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,940
It's actually fully voiced?

235
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Oh, not fully.

236
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:46,700
Okay.

237
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,160
I was gonna say...

238
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,340
Wait.

239
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,720
Huh?

240
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,040
Help everyone is friends at the end and they live in a big house like a Sentai team.

241
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,540
Hahaha.

242
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,160
Hmm.

243
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,580
Pretty much fully.

244
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,380
That's insane.

245
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
Obviously not in English.

246
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:05,860
Yeah.

247
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,340
So then I would have to...

248
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,660
Read it out anyway.

249
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,300
Which is, uh...

250
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,140
Oof.

251
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,700
Yeah.

252
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,840
Yeah.

253
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,380
Yeah.

254
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:16,400
No.

255
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,820
Maybe not right now for me.

256
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,560
Hahaha.

257
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,260
No visual novels...

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,860
For me currently.

259
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,460
Hmm.

260
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,660
Did you see the demo for Toho 20?

261
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,020
I...

262
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,740
Don't think I saw the demo, but I saw it was announced.

263
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I did see.

264
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,280
It was announced a little bit a while ago.

265
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,360
Hmm.

266
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,480
Okay.

267
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
Are we ready, guys?

268
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,400
Are we...

269
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,960
Ready?

270
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,000
Mission 13.

271
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,060
We have...

272
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,280
Hmm.

273
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,000
Eight.

274
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,800
Eight missions left to go, baby.

275
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,460
Three warriors.

276
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,660
Eating Mike Tyson's ass.

277
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,980
Thank you!

278
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,280
For the dead captain.

279
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,820
Thank you!

280
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,800
Okay.

281
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,760
Will you watch this, but...

282
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,680
Um...

283
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,040
I must watch it again.

284
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,280
Hahaha.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,160
I must...

286
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,140
Watch this again.

287
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,060
Well...

288
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,660
Looks like no one's worse for wear.

289
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,540
I'm just gonna double check.

290
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,280
Lady's so cute.

291
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,460
Gosh, she's so cute.

292
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,200
I wish she had more screen time.

293
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,380
Give Lady more screen time.

294
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,680
Hey.

295
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,900
Where'd that garbage god go?

296
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,420
What is Urizin after?

297
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,760
Urizin.

298
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,700
He's at the top.

299
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,360
Of the Clyphod.

300
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,820
It's the other way around, Dante.

301
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,640
This is the lowest level of the Clyphod's upper echelon.

302
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,060
Human blood is the source of demon's power.

303
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,280
The fruit born through the Clyphod is even more dense...

304
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,960
Gotta give it to Virgil's clothes.

305
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,880
Hahaha.

306
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,860
Its power is unparalleled.

307
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,920
Even the almighty Mundus used it to become king of the underworld.

308
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,080
Avid told me everything.

309
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,020
Yeah, well, that's a lovely story and all, but...

310
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,540
As long as we know where to find him.

311
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,040
I guess who Nico's dad is.

312
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,720
So...

313
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,820
Whoa!

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,880
You...

315
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,660
Are the infamous Dante!

316
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,760
That's assumed...

317
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,440
That means I know...

318
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,180
That means it's a character I know.

319
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm Nicolette Goldstein.

320
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,140
Tell familiar?

321
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,980
My grandmother is...

322
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,020
Is Nell Goldstein.

323
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,220
The gunsmith that made all your fancy weapons that you got...

324
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,860
Trapped back there.

325
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,420
Hottest character in the game?

326
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,500
Who?

327
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,780
It's Nero!

328
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,040
You don't much look like her.

329
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,200
Yeah.

330
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,200
I got my looks from my daddy.

331
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,220
That's about all I got from him.

332
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,520
But based on his research...

333
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,500
Her dad is Angus Beef?

334
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,080
Um...

335
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,520
Consider it a gift.

336
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,460
In honor of us finally meeting.

337
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,960
Where was she in four?

338
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,820
Meeting.

339
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,580
Aw yeah, baby.

340
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,880
Time for it to happen again.

341
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,660
For those wondering, we watched this literally yesterday, so...

342
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,040
Oh god.

343
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,980
Why does he do this?

344
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,200
Why is he...

345
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,500
Why is he hoot and holler?

346
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,100
Oh!

347
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,040
Actually, I shouldn't even...

348
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,840
Why am I saying why?

349
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,280
I love Nico.

350
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,140
She's like so excited for his stuff.

351
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,040
Everyone else is like...

352
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,460
Trish is like...

353
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,020
I'm gonna go too.

354
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,660
Why don't you sit this one out?

355
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
Don't call me dead weight.

356
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,340
No thanks.

357
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,780
I've got all the power I need.

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,760
Right here.

359
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,780
You don't understand.

360
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
It's not what I mean.

361
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
Let him go, Dante.

362
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
Time is a luxury that we can no longer afford.

363
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,180
Fancy glove.

364
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,580
Don't call me dead weight.

365
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh god.

366
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,060
V.

367
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,080
Hehehehe.

368
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,880
Well, that's all you had to say, Mr. Poetry.

369
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,820
I'm gonna go my way, and you guys can go yours.

370
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
Let's just say that's the best for the cause.

371
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,120
Peace out.

372
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,260
Sorry if you can hear me chewing my cough drop.

373
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,100
Yeah, we need to give V a better skin care routine.

374
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,120
His skin barrier is damaged.

375
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:36,980
Whee!

376
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,480
Okay.

377
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,620
You could call him a...

378
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:42,940
Flake?

379
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,980
Hey!

380
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,020
Hey V!

381
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,340
Don't...

382
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,980
Flake out on us!

383
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,060
Yummy mentioned you dancing off camera so I can imagine you doing...

384
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,500
I just... I just move around a lot.

385
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,600
I just wiggle.

386
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,980
I can't help it.

387
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:08,720
Alright.

388
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,060
First VTuber I've ever joined in membership of Super Chatted.

389
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,320
Woo!

390
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,000
Thank you!

391
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,240
Woohoo!

392
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,620
Thank you so much!

393
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,400
Hold on.

394
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,000
Implication that the only thing stopping Virgil from absolutely covering himself in tattoos is his demon side.

395
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,900
Hm?

396
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
Oh yeah, you're right.

397
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,200
You're right.

398
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,920
Yeah, his humanity side has like all the tattoos and stuff.

399
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,940
What's up with that?

400
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,920
He's such an emo guy.

401
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,760
He's such an emo guy.

402
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,000
Alrighty.

403
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,700
So I'm gonna play as Dante.

404
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,540
Teare...

405
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,860
Wish we could see more of Virgil...

406
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,580
W-when did he get so into poetry?

407
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,700
If he weren't a demon, you know, you could see him like at...

408
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,580
Like a... a jazz club underground basement.

409
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,320
Like reading off his emo poetry.

410
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,640
He's a secret emo.

411
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,160
Oh yeah, lady.

412
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,200
You're so cute.

413
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,680
Alright.

414
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,280
So we just got the hat.

415
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,280
So let me go into the void.

416
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,500
And um...

417
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,880
Wait, where is the hat?

418
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,060
Oh, Dr. Faust.

419
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,560
Here we go.

420
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,700
Man in the red.

421
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,360
No, that V.

422
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,920
Couldn't be V.

423
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,520
Carpet the area around you with countless robs that will damage enemies on contact.

424
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,440
Expends the robs you've collected.

425
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,420
But we get a lot of robs back, right?

426
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,060
We'll get a lot back, right?

427
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,140
Kevin, welcome back.

428
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,720
Thank you.

429
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,900
The black ink on V's arms and hair are his summons.

430
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,280
Oh.

431
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,680
Makes sense.

432
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,080
Inflict damage on all enemies hit by set hat.

433
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,000
While absorbing robs.

434
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,200
After executing a set hat or mad hatter.

435
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,820
Okay, I'll have to look at the...

436
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,200
I'll have to look at the...

437
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,100
What's it called?

438
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,040
The...

439
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,240
The list of...

440
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,640
The skill list.

441
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,540
Increases the orbs earned and orbs expended while Dr. Faust is equipped.

442
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Uses more orbs for more attack power.

443
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,400
Okay, okay.

444
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,740
Alright, let's...

445
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,140
Let's try it out, I suppose.

446
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,660
I'll try!

447
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,520
I'll try this one.

448
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,560
Oh, okay.

449
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,260
We are being left stick back X.

450
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,560
Okay.

451
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,620
Does it work like a gun?

452
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,700
Oh...

453
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,820
Thank you for the five kids.

454
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,580
Thank you!

455
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,760
Oh...

456
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,000
Why should I put on my cowboy hat?

457
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,180
Okay.

458
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,450
Pick him up.

459
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,450
Pick up my brawars!

460
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,210
Pick up my brawars!

461
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,770
Oh my god.

462
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,840
Whoa.

463
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,680
Okay.

464
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:51,890
Okay.

465
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:53,970
Okay.

466
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,370
Okay.

467
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,390
This is evil.

468
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,870
This is evil.

469
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,690
To make me, forcing me to use my own money.

470
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,080
Who are you talking to?

471
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,020
Oh my god.

472
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,660
The idle pose is too, is too much.

473
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,330
Oh, Gunslinger move.

474
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,050
Oh... There we go.

475
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,290
Whoa!

476
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,690
So it's like a...

477
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,930
What?!

478
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,650
He's got the hat on!

479
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,930
Why is he wearing the hat?

480
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,990
Wait, why is he got the hat on?

481
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,110
Does this produce rorbs or...

482
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,710
He's rooting too!

483
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,730
Now I need to see every enemy with the hat on.

484
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,010
Including...

485
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,950
Hold on, I think this one will be really silly looking.

486
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,870
Okay, here you go.

487
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,590
It's floating above your little head!

488
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,850
Wait, this is so funny!

489
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,170
Oh wait, these ugly skellies are gonna look so stupid.

490
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,130
Okay, here you go.

491
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:14,750
Wait!

492
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,650
He looks like a rock star!

493
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,430
Wait, it actually suits him!

494
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,370
I said you'd look dumb, but it suits you!

495
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,250
Aw, man.

496
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,190
He looked like a rock star.

497
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,330
It actually looks good!

498
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,030
Oh my god!

499
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,850
Cause it looks like the...

500
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,030
The little, like, head part...

501
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,270
Is his hair.

502
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,410
He looks crazy!

503
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,390
He looks cool!

504
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,210
Oh gosh!

505
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,130
Who else?

506
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,730
Wait, I gotta see a lizard with a...

507
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,430
There's one enemy we have yet to encounter.

508
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,850
That's kinda freaky.

509
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,560
Okay, kill me up.

510
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,520
Here's...

511
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,380
Here's your hat!

512
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,520
What the?!

513
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,620
Why are you fighting me?!

514
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,320
Oh, shoot.

515
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,900
I think I turned on the wrong setting.

516
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,260
I'm not ready.

517
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm not ready.

518
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,220
I'm not...

519
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,580
Keep me...

520
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,100
Take your hat!

521
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,580
Take your hat!

522
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,780
He looks kinda cute.

523
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,580
Dang.

524
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,420
Dang.

525
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:49,940
Okay.

526
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,810
Oh, let's leave the void.

527
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,010
I think we're good now.

528
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,010
I understand.

529
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,570
Okay.

530
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,110
Oh, I have 37.

531
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,150
I've leveled up all my sword master, which is great.

532
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,830
We've got...

533
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,710
Balrog.

534
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,250
I haven't really done...

535
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,190
I haven't really upgraded him, even though I use it a lot.

536
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,510
Upgrade SDT.

537
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,770
Oh, this?

538
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,370
Wait.

539
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,830
No, this is just a double...

540
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,970
Wait.

541
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,850
Can I...

542
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Oh my god!

543
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,260
Drive is back!

544
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,000
Where is it?

545
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,160
Oh!

546
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,220
Here we go.

547
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,100
Sin Stinger!

548
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,980
Ho ho ho ho!

549
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,380
Oh my god!

550
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,900
Sin Inferno!

551
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,320
Oh my god!

552
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,720
Demolition!

553
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,280
Oh my god!

554
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,660
Press and hold LT!

555
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,800
Grab an enemy and trigger a blast from within.

556
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,480
Shattering the enemy with raw explosive power!

557
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:16,240
Slam a thunderous punch into the ground, making the fires of hell erupt around you and launch any nearby enemies into the air.

558
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,520
Quadruple S.

559
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah, it just looks like a...

560
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,640
Wait, hold on.

561
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,420
Let's try it.

562
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,460
Oh my god.

563
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,760
Oh, come on game.

564
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,060
Give me some DT.

565
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,900
Give me some...

566
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,520
Man.

567
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm bored.

568
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,520
Settings?

569
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,680
Wait, can I do it in settings?

570
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,640
Player settings?

571
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,680
Recover...

572
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,020
Yes.

573
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,560
Oh, yes.

574
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,580
Unlimited!

575
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,860
Okay.

576
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,720
Nice.

577
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,440
Royal Guard Gage.

578
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,200
I don't even know...

579
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,060
I haven't even...

580
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,960
Sorry guys, I don't do Royal Guard.

581
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,760
So do I still have to...

582
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,220
There we go.

583
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,070
I'm holding.

584
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,110
Oh, left trigger.

585
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,670
I'm an idiot.

586
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,510
Oop.

587
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,830
How much does it...

588
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,130
Does it like use a ton of it?

589
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,410
Does it like use up my thing or...

590
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:44,890
Wow.

591
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:44,990
No.

592
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,230
It's just a black hole.

593
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,590
What?

594
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,190
Oh my god.

595
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,310
The bitrate?

596
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,330
Oh no, I'm sorry.

597
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:55,770
Nope.

598
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,650
It's just a timer?

599
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,110
Cool.

600
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,150
Wait, so...

601
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,650
I would have to get Stinger.

602
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,790
Since I don't have it anymore.

603
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:04,930
There we are.

604
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,480
Whoa!

605
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,100
Oh, that's right.

606
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,240
Uh, this button is...

607
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,640
Wait.

608
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,780
Oh, there's only one.

609
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,080
Okay, so this is a teleport.

610
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:18,900
Hold on, let me see.

611
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,760
Have an appointment to get to.

612
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,040
Don't ever apologize for not being able to stay.

613
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,360
Good luck with your appointment!

614
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,740
Try your...

615
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,420
Alt...

616
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,260
X plus Y.

617
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,700
Try holding X and Y.

618
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,200
Oh, that?

619
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,210
Oh, never mind.

620
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,830
This?

621
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,990
Holy cow!

622
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,350
That's my ult.

623
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,150
Okay, this...

624
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,530
I have to remember that this doesn't do anything now.

625
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,690
It's just a teleport, you know?

626
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,730
What did I do before though?

627
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,870
That, like that.

628
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,350
Oh, that's just X.

629
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,610
Okay.

630
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,770
Oh my god.

631
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,330
Yeah, you can't change styles.

632
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,350
Oh my god.

633
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,530
I wish I could, um...

634
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,650
Add more enemies in the void, you know?

635
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,070
So I could see, like, kind of what the range is on it.

636
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,390
I wonder if I can.

637
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:56,810
Let's see.

638
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,490
Enemy setting.

639
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,490
No, it doesn't look like it.

640
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,050
Hmm.

641
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,960
Holding X does nothing.

642
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,300
Okay.

643
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,360
Just go to the other side?

644
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:21,660
Okay.

645
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,580
Let's try it.

646
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:23,980
Meow.

647
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:25,960
Meow.

648
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,720
Meow.

649
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,340
Meow.

650
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,560
There we go.

651
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:31,800
Okay.

652
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,760
Can you see me?

653
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,210
He's still standing.

654
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,090
He's still standing.

656
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:57,950
He's still standing.

658
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:57,970
Okay.

659
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,590
It's not that far then.

660
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,870
So much for infinite range.

661
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,210
Yeah.

662
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,050
Right?

663
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,130
Everybody was just like, you can go as far as you want.

664
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,230
It'll hit.

665
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,930
This is why we do it for science.

666
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,150
Let's try, like, over here.

667
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,710
There's infinite, I said.

668
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,650
Hey.

669
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,270
Hey.

670
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:27,810
Hey.

671
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,790
I'm pressing him at the same time.

672
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,570
There we go.

673
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,810
Oh, there he goes.

674
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,170
There he is.

675
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:43,550
Okay.

676
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:45,870
All right.

677
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,380
You want to try it on again?

678
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,640
Okay.

679
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,000
Let's quit the void.

680
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,740
I think I kind of just want to...

681
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,640
Well, I want to upgrade these, but I also kind of want to just get into it.

682
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,680
But I'm also like, I want to upgrade these.

683
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,120
I think Sin Stinger would be good.

684
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,200
Right?

685
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,900
Try Luce.

686
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,740
Is that this one?

687
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,740
Focus energy with your outstretched wings and raise the earth with laser barrage.

688
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,100
Wait, hold on real quick, guys.

689
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,880
Okay.

690
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,700
Let's try it.

691
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,280
I just press RT.

692
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,600
I'll hold RT to keep the attack going.

693
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:58,840
Okay.

694
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,220
It shreds boss's health bars.

695
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,000
Give him a little bit of space.

696
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,020
Okay.

697
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,040
So if I hold it.

698
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,300
It'll just be...

699
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,740
Oh my God.

700
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,900
Easy mode is now selectable.

701
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,620
The skill.

702
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,460
Holy.

703
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,740
Oh my God.

704
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,920
Well.

705
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,420
That's a skill.

706
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,260
That's a skill.

707
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,280
But you aren't I framed.

708
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:18,800
Okay.

709
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,120
Okay.

710
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,540
I mean, I have just a...

711
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,640
I feel like I want to at least buy the Stinger.

712
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,780
I think I want to at least buy the Stinger.

713
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,760
I can maybe save up for...

714
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,040
One of these.

715
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,500
I didn't try this one, but that's okay.

716
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,700
Hmm.

717
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,940
Stinger save up for demolition.

718
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:54,840
Yeah.

719
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,000
Either that or...

720
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,260
Is it...

721
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,740
Did I say it?

722
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,440
Is it Luce?

723
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,140
Is that right?

724
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,680
Luce.

725
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,580
Luce.

726
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,820
Ooh.

727
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,820
The Lulu.

728
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,920
The Lulu.

729
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,080
Is correct, Okob.

730
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,040
I think it's Luce like Lucifer.

731
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,720
The Luce.

732
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,720
Luce.

733
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:17,760
Luce?

734
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,740
Lucey like Lucifer?

735
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,680
Maybe.

736
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,180
I don't know.

737
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:22,820
Alright.

738
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,000
We'll do that then.

739
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,920
Who knows?

740
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,320
I might lose it all...

741
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,980
All of my money.

742
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,920
I might gain all my money back.

743
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,820
If I use the high.

744
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,540
Who knows?

745
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,940
Who knows?

746
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:33,960
Luce.

747
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,000
It's Luce.

748
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,780
You were saying it right.

749
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,000
Ok.

750
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,220
Luce Goosey.

751
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,680
The Lucey Goosey.

752
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,080
I like learning easy moves.

753
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,440
We're here for a good time.

754
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,180
Not a...

755
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,340
Not a...

756
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,240
Crazy time.

757
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
Well, we are here for a crazy time.

758
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:02,920
Ok.

759
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,580
We got our bike.

760
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,640
We got our punch.

761
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,660
Let's just start the mission, baby.

762
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,400
Let's just get back into it.

763
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

764
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

765
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,680
Let me back up at some point.

766
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,100
But for now, one foot in front of the other.

767
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,040
What?

768
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,460
You put me in front of a...

769
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,580
Oh.

770
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,800
Oh, okay.

771
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,760
I was gonna say...

772
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,020
What?

773
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,500
Where am I?

774
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,260
Where am I?

775
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:28,760
Let's see.

776
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,200
What do I have?

777
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,860
Let's put our...

778
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,060
Let's put our fists on.

779
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,560
Oh my god.

780
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,060
The fists with the...

781
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,620
I guess it really doesn't matter what gun I have.

782
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:38,840
Okay.

783
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,120
In we go.

784
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,500
Oh, no.

785
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,520
Is this the...

786
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,120
The last enemy that is not...

787
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
On the...

788
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,440
Thing that I have yet to...

789
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,620
No.

790
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,060
It looks like...

791
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,250
Oh, it looks like the...

792
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,400
Ice guys.

793
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,800
But it's electricity instead.

794
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,420
Oh my god.

795
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,100
What are you doing to me?

796
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,400
What are you doing to me?

797
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,160
Um...

798
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,710
Where are you?

799
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:13,950
Oh.

800
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,370
Oh.

801
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:16,790
Go...

802
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,270
Go to him.

803
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,320
Where'd he go?

804
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:27,780
Oh.

805
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,350
Oh.

806
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,150
I beat him up.

807
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,890
Put a hat on him.

808
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,070
That wasn't even...

809
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,350
He acted so tough.

810
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,570
I thought I was gonna be in here for like...

811
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,210
So long.

812
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,130
Can't see anything.

813
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:53,470
Woo!

814
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,830
Woo!

815
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,210
Oh, no, no, no, no.

816
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,370
Oh, no, no, no.

817
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,770
Oh, no, no, no.

818
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,570
Just gonna slice and dice that right in there.

819
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,170
Oh, I'm on...

820
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,230
Ouch!

821
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,350
Ouch!

822
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,390
Yup.

823
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,370
I'm just gonna do that.

824
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,570
There we go.

825
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,510
Oh my god.

826
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,630
There's so many things in here.

827
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,290
Okay.

828
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,170
Uh...

829
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:22,690
Uh...

830
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,790
Where'd that guy go?

831
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,310
Woo!

832
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:24,770
Woo!

833
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,550
Woo!

834
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,510
Ouch!

835
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,830
Oh my god.

836
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,470
Oh

837
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,220
my god.

838
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,060
Oh my god.

839
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,600
Oh my god.

840
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,780
Time to hat.

841
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,450
They just...

842
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,350
It hurts!

843
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,050
No!

844
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,030
It hurts watching my buddy go down.

845
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,670
I'll keep it on though.

846
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,270
Uh...

847
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,590
Hold on.

848
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,990
Sorry.

849
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,410
I'm trying to get myself situated.

850
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,210
Yeah.

851
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,710
There we go.

852
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,030
That's one guy.

853
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,070
Oh, oh, oh!

854
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,150
Oh, oh, oh!

855
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,270
Yeah, that's...

856
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,530
Oh, yeah!

857
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,470
Oh, yeah!

858
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,740
Oh, yeah!

859
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,880
Where'd the big guy go?

860
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

861
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,940
Did I kill him?

862
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,920
Nice.

863
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,520
Yeah, where did he go?

864
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,540
Oh!

865
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,000
The style is worth the sacrifice.

866
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,840
I guess...

867
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:45,940
Oh!

868
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,580
Oh!

869
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,300
I think I found out where they went!

870
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,220
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

871
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:52,700
Ouch!

872
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,860
It does so much damage.

873
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,440
No, come here.

874
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,220
There we go.

875
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,120
I think I found out where they went.

876
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,840
Guys, stop yelling at me to charge my SDT.

877
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,380
I'm not gonna use it on a fight like this.

878
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,740
Oh, no, no, no.

879
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,260
No, no, get through us too!

880
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,300
Oh!

881
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,080
Oh, oh, I missed it.

882
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,940
There we go.

883
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,780
Oh, I think I got it.

884
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,480
Nice, okay.

885
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,680
What the hell is that eyeball?!

886
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,140
Oh, my God.

887
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,820
Okay, you know what?

888
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,520
I'm gonna D-team.

889
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,360
Just so I can take care of these guys.

890
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,440
Get some health back.

891
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,800
Where are you?

892
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,440
Where'd you go?

893
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,480
Beat him up!

894
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,570
No, no, no, the eyeball!

895
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,930
Eyeball's gonna explode.

896
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:41,350
Where the...

897
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:41,870
Oh!

898
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,170
I just noticed this one.

899
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:43,830
I'm so stupid.

900
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,830
Okay, cool.

901
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,870
I think it's producing eyeballs.

902
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,110
Or is it producing more lizards?

903
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:58,610
I can't...

904
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,390
Oh, golly.

905
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,090
Oh!

906
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:00,730
It just...

907
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:01,490
It just disappeared!

908
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,550
Yippee!

909
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,750
Oh, you are producing the eyeballs!

910
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,870
You're stinking...

911
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,540
A machine that produces...

912
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,200
I was stuck.

913
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,920
I couldn't jump.

914
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,860
It wouldn't let me.

915
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,640
Oh...

916
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,320
Okay.

917
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,510
Oh...

918
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,650
I'm gonna die!

919
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:52,900
Yeah!

920
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:55,900
Yeah!

921
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,650
Come here, come here.

922
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,550
Come here, come here.

923
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:04,850
Come here, come here.

924
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,550
Oh, come here, come here.

925
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,910
I hate these eyeballs.

926
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:07,990
They're so annoying.

927
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:08,710
Okay.

928
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,710
Die!

929
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,350
Die, you stupid eyeball!

930
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:36,950
No!

931
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:37,870
No!

932
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:38,730
Where'd you go?

933
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,150
Come here.

934
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,730
Yeah!

935
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,190
Stupid!

936
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:44,050
Woohoo!

937
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:48,650
Yeah!

938
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:49,490
Kick him!

939
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,610
Kick him where it hurts!

940
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,020
That's right.

941
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,320
You think?

942
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,200
You thought?

943
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,300
You thought?

944
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,340
Die!

945
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,320
Thank you, Kim.

946
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,300
Yeah!

947
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,240
Destroy this thing.

948
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,100
And...

949
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,180
We got that one.

950
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,300
Woof!

951
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:35,660
Woof!

952
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,340
Wait a second!

953
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,080
I was just sipping my tea!

954
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,880
Um...

955
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,720
Uh...

956
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,060
Okay.

957
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,320
Rude!

958
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,720
So rude.

959
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,520
Yeah!

960
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,640
Take that!

961
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,120
Uh...

962
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,800
Wait, where...

963
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:03,880
What's...

964
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,800
Do I go in the hole?

965
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Oh, I thought that was an exit.

966
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,600
Wait, hold on.

967
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,020
There has to be something behind it.

968
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,200
No?

969
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,130
Guess we go in the hole.

970
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,830
Hole it.

971
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:25,930
Whee!

972
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,430
I can smell that piece of shit from up here.

973
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,230
It needs to be flushed.

974
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:31,250
What?

975
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,010
Give me more.

976
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,510
I guess we'll take this too.

977
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,550
It needs to be flushed.

978
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,250
Take that too.

979
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,160
So...

980
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,760
Ah!

981
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,320
Just a little bit more.

982
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,460
Just a tiny, tiny bit more.

983
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,100
Tiny, tiny.

984
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,120
Need more hat.

985
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,780
I'm scared of the hat!

986
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:15,940
What?

987
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,240
I'm scared of wasting my warbs.

988
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,200
I'm greedy.

989
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,700
Well, there's a hole there.

990
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,760
And...

991
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,380
Watch out Dante.

992
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,340
That's all there is.

993
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,380
It seems.

994
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,380
Only put it on them.

995
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,580
So a gunslinger put it on them and then return back to...

996
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,340
Wait, is there more than one hole?

997
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,360
I didn't see any others.

998
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,440
I only saw this big one.

999
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,800
This bad boy.

1000
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't see any other holes.

1001
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
Wait, I don't need gunslinger to put it on?

1002
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,920
But it was always B that I pushed.

1003
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,100
X forward.

1004
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,500
Forward X.

1005
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,240
Oh, okay.

1006
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:18,760
Ah!

1007
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:19,700
Ah!

1008
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,260
Okay, okay.

1009
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,580
He's stretching.

1010
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,280
Sword Master 4.

1011
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,000
Okay, fine.

1012
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,300
I'll read the skill list.

1013
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:39,860
Ugh!

1014
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,480
I'm not gonna...

1015
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,940
I'm not gonna remember it.

1016
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,920
I'm not gonna remember it.

1017
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,140
I don't know what to tell you guys.

1018
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,540
Oh god, this one I learned.

1019
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,520
Forward plus B.

1020
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,720
That's what I learned.

1021
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,160
Okay.

1022
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,240
RB.

1023
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,640
Forward.

1024
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,620
B.

1025
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,520
Remembering optional.

1026
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,020
See, my fingers just go...

1027
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,740
My fingers just go...

1028
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,680
Wait, I wanted to change back to punching.

1029
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,880
Aw, shucks.

1030
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,790
Wait, keep...

1031
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:31,450
Keep doing it.

1032
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:32,690
Keep doing it.

1033
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,710
Wait, keep doing it.

1034
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:34,910
Keep doing it.

1035
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,590
Keep doing it.

1036
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,350
Keep doing it.

1037
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,250
Keep doing it.

1038
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,070
Keep doing it.

1039
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:38,630
Keep doing it.

1040
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,750
Keep doing it.

1041
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,110
Wait, I'm trying to destroy this thing.

1042
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:42,430
Please!

1043
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,410
Get out of my way, lizards!

1044
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:45,970
Please, little lizards.

1045
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,750
Wait, you guys said B.

1046
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,470
It doesn't give it to them.

1047
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,310
Oh, you said X.

1048
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,550
I told you guys, I forget.

1049
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:20,630
Sorry.

1050
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:21,750
I told you I'd forget.

1051
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:24,390
Oh, there we go.

1052
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,570
I gave it to him.

1053
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,530
I gave him his little hat.

1054
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,940
I think there's another thing creating monsters.

1055
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,360
I think it's over here.

1056
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,240
Yes siree.

1057
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,320
I heard you.

1058
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,900
Don't try and play me.

1059
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,630
Don't try and play me.

1060
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,070
I heard you revving up behind me.

1061
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,680
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

1062
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,380
Other side.

1063
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,360
Yeah, okay.

1064
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,220
Now...

1065
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,300
I

1066
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:20,700
wanna...

1067
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:20,940
Oh!

1068
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,340
Ow!

1069
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:23,940
Jump...

1070
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,900
Uh...

1071
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,560
There we go.

1072
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:26,600
Woo!

1073
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:26,960
Woo!

1074
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,240
And it was...

1075
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,680
Ouch.

1076
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,180
Oh, it was a R.

1077
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,320
I have to rip up for it!

1078
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,040
I think!

1079
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,020
Wait, hold on.

1080
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,580
Oh my god!

1081
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,540
You get my ass handed to me.

1082
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:02,900
Okay.

1083
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:03,760
I'll DT.

1084
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,300
Where are you guys?

1085
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:05,960
Oh, there.

1086
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,130
You wanna touch me?

1087
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,850
You wanna touch me?

1088
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,550
You wanna touch me?

1089
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,180
Ah!

1090
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,500
Ah!

1091
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:23,920
There we go.

1092
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:24,700
Ah!

1093
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,260
Oh!

1094
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:26,600
Oh!

1095
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:26,820
Oh!

1096
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,320
Who's shooting at me?

1097
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,600
Come here.

1098
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:34,920
Come here.

1099
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,200
Come here.

1100
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,480
Oh my god!

1101
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:36,900
Oh!

1102
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,980
You son of a gun.

1103
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,080
I'll give you...

1104
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,660
A hat.

1105
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,340
I...

1106
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,420
I won't do that, actually.

1107
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,400
I messed up.

1108
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,820
Stop spinning!

1109
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,840
Stop spinning!

1110
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:51,900
Stop spinning!

1111
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,060
Oh my god!

1112
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,960
I gotta stop getting on the little hats.

1113
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,820
I'm too obsessed with the hats.

1114
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,840
Okay.

1115
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,320
Can I...

1116
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,600
Can I please, at least...

1117
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,420
Please.

1118
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,020
Please.

1119
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,740
Please.

1120
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,160
Please.

1121
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,080
Please.

1122
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:11,960
Oh my god.

1123
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:13,980
Oh, you're so...

1124
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,260
You guys are so obsessed with me!

1125
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,010
Oh my god.

1126
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,050
Who threw off my groove?

1127
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,370
Kill!

1128
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,270
Oh.

1129
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,850
Kill!

1130
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:51,450
Kill!

1131
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,450
Kill!

1132
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:52,890
Kill!

1133
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:53,030
Get him!

1134
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:53,870
Oh my gosh!

1135
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,890
Oh!

1136
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:06,030
Oh!

1137
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,460
Oh!

1138
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,380
Oh...

1139
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:18,640
There we go.

1140
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,500
Ay!

1141
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:25,080
I like when I can...

1142
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:26,720
Get

1143
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,030
them out of their combo.

1144
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,330
Is there another thing that... No?

1145
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:38,730
Okay.

1146
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,270
Come on.

1147
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,110
Go after that guy.

1148
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,660
Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge!

1149
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,220
Wait, where's your hat?

1150
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,620
Oh, I forgot to press forward, I think.

1151
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,780
No, you got a hat.

1152
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:04,940
Ouch.

1153
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,940
No, he's got his little hat.

1154
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,410
He-he-he!

1155
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,550
Yeah.

1156
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,440
Oh, alright.

1157
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,220
Oh, I... Ohhh, I hear them!

1158
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,810
Like I hear them kind of like...

1159
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,890
You can hear it kinda zapping.

1160
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,930
Does that mean I have to pick the right one?

1161
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,190
It's kind of like a game.

1162
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,090
You have to guess which one you go to.

1163
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:24,870
Or do they sometimes have things behind them?

1164
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:25,850
You know what I mean?

1165
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,010
No, just break them all?

1166
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,590
Bust them all.

1167
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:35,190
Okay.

1168
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,650
I guess that's what... Oh!

1169
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:40,730
Okay, I see.

1170
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,530
It gets it rid of the... Okay, I understand now.

1171
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,950
I understand now.

1172
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,330
Now we go kill the Zappy Mushroom.

1173
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,930
Okay, we kill the Zappy Mushroom.

1174
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,070
Okay.

1175
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,770
Alright, this one goes to... Somewhere.

1176
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,830
Okay.

1177
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,330
No more... Fungi.

1178
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,910
Your mold problem is... You know what, baby?

1179
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,850
Maybe Dante really is a handyman.

1180
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,950
Is there any fungus in here?

1181
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,490
There... There's a Gorb!

1182
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,240
Nice.

1183
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1184
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,160
Also... Let's grab all of this, too.

1185
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,360
Delicious health.

1186
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,400
Thank you.

1187
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,110
Okay...

1188
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,310
Um... Did not get rid of... Oh!

1189
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,450
Oh!

1190
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,570
There's another hole!

1191
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,270
What?

1192
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,290
It got rid of another hole?

1193
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,410
Or it got... It opened up another hole!

1194
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:32,330
And we'll get rid of the... Electric Mushroom!

1195
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,550
Before he gets me!

1196
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,110
Nice!

1197
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:34,970
Okay.

1198
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,850
Secret Tunnel!

1199
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,780
Secret Tunnel!

1200
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:48,800
Okay.

1201
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:55,620
Honey...

1202
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,040
Whoa!

1203
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,420
Whoa!

1204
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,540
We're in the honeycomb!

1205
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:00,340
Whoa!

1206
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:06,490
Secret...

1207
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,570
Lots of Rorbs.

1208
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,170
Thank you.

1209
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,910
Many Rorbs.

1210
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:14,470
Thank you.

1211
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:15,370
Many Rorbs.

1212
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:15,850
Warbs.

1213
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:16,850
Nice.

1214
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:19,150
Let's go.

1215
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,030
Oh my gosh.

1216
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,250
It's a feast down here.

1217
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,030
What does... What the... What would Pooh Bear say?

1218
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,540
Did I... Did I get all of them?

1219
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,980
Uh... I think so.

1220
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,200
Wait.

1221
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,680
What's in here?

1222
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,020
Nothing.

1223
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,320
Whoa!

1224
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,130
Let's punch it to death.

1225
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,930
I was worried for a second.

1226
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,330
And then this goes back to the room we were just in.

1227
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:12,590
Yikes.

1228
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:20,230
I'm starting to notice a pattern with these rooms.

1229
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:21,950
Oh!

1230
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,450
Hello, V.

1231
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:26,390
Hello, Nero.

1232
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:26,610
Oh!

1233
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:27,250
We're all together!

1234
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,570
I don't think our hole led to the same place.

1235
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,890
Looks like we still got a long ways to go.

1236
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:44,950
Yey!

1237
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,830
How bad!

1238
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,430
Three warriors.

1239
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:01,810
June 15th.

1240
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:02,490
1 PM.

1241
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,670
He's literally fading away.

1242
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:11,590
What are you talking about?

1243
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:16,010
He probably weighs like... He probably weighs nothing.

1244
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,490
Oh god, V.

1245
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:39,130
Can he reconnect with Urgil?

1246
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,330
Can they re-fuse?

1247
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,810
Fusion dance?

1248
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,430
Come on!

1249
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,210
Mission 14.

1250
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,970
Oh, we're back to V.

1251
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,350
Alright, I'm just not gonna buy anything.

1252
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:00,970
I'm sorry.

1253
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:04,850
But...

1254
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,210
I might buy Porb.

1255
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,150
I probably will buy Porb, if anything.

1256
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,070
Porb always good.

1257
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,410
Especially because I've been playing as Dante.

1258
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,030
So he uses the devil trigger too.

1259
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,040
Porb benefits everyone.

1260
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:36,900
Kinda.

1261
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,160
And then we'll leave it at that.

1262
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,260
That's all we'll do.

1263
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,760
I want to buy Blorb, but I will refrain.

1264
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,300
I will refrain.

1265
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:46,640
Alright.

1266
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:47,760
V.

1267
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,380
Let's get going.

1268
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,920
Except the dead weight.

1269
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,040
Okay.

1270
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:03,800
Alright, V.

1271
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,440
We got this.

1272
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,000
Oh look, he's fine now.

1273
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,380
He knows how to run.

1274
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,820
He's fine.

1275
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:09,960
He's fine.

1276
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,500
See?

1277
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,740
All good.

1278
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,400
He's A-okay.

1279
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,760
We're running.

1280
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,460
We're...

1281
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,940
We're doing skateboard tricks.

1282
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:21,440
See?

1283
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,940
He's faking it.

1284
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,700
Oh.

1285
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,600
Oh.

1286
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,980
Are you alright, V?

1287
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,460
You might wanna take a break here.

1288
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,060
No, no, no.

1289
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,920
Oh, we're walking now.

1290
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:34,580
Okay.

1291
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,400
Dramatic.

1292
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:41,610
Okay.

1293
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,510
What's in here?

1294
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,250
Maybe drink it.

1295
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,110
I'll make you feel better.

1296
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:49,550
Whoa.

1297
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,790
Nope.

1298
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:57,150
Oh.

1299
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:02,470
His tattoos!

1300
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:04,630
His summons!

1301
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:06,710
Oh.

1302
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:12,770
Let's go.

1303
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,150
Three for the price of one, baby.

1304
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,050
Yeah, we got it.

1305
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,090
I was... you know what?

1306
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:22,590
Yeah.

1307
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:27,050
Every DMC game has to have a beautiful, badass booby monster.

1308
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,690
I'm losing my power.

1309
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,270
Gotta recover somehow.

1310
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:35,190
Recover by getting more, um...

1311
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:37,610
Money.

1312
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:43,950
Yeah, it's healing my... everything.

1313
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,070
Yeah, look at that.

1314
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,910
We gather money and we get...

1315
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:47,870
We get better.

1316
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,470
Yeah, look at that.

1317
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:54,430
Ah.

1318
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:57,070
Maybe money does cure all.

1319
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,410
Money does buy happiness.

1320
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,390
Come on.

1321
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:02,130
V, it's right there.

1322
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:10,790
V.

1323
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,430
V, I'm gonna need you to make a really big...

1324
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,050
Big boy jump here, okay, buddy?

1325
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,310
Big boy jump!

1326
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,130
How can I get up there?

1327
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,950
Guys...

1328
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,010
And over there, too!

1329
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,670
This dimension is magical.

1330
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,330
Honor DMC tradition, boss rush?

1331
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,150
Please, no.

1332
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,150
Please, God, no.

1333
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:39,490
I know you're probably right.

1334
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,450
I got Gorb.

1335
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,790
It's only three bosses this time?

1336
01:04:58,930 --> 01:04:59,450
Okay, okay.

1337
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:02,070
How do I get up...

1338
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,770
Do I have to collect my bird?

1339
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,450
Do I have to collect Griffin first?

1340
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,570
Alright.

1341
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,610
How do I boss rush?

1342
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,770
Oh, I have to go through these portals.

1343
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:11,090
Okay.

1344
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,220
Okay, I'll...

1345
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,640
Let me just look behind them real quick, V.

1346
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,540
Let's just look behind and see if...

1347
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:22,860
Oh, see?

1348
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,860
There's a Yorb right there.

1349
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,720
I mean a Warb.

1350
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,600
Not a Yorb.

1351
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:31,430
Oh, there's some more up there, even.

1352
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:37,150
Does each one show a different thing?

1353
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:37,470
Okay.

1354
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,570
Oh, we got Phantom there.

1355
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:40,650
Wait.

1356
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:40,950
Wait.

1357
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:41,850
Oh, it shows...

1358
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:42,930
Wait, is this the...

1359
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:43,490
No.

1360
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,730
This is the boss, isn't it?

1361
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,490
Oh, golly.

1362
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,070
Golly.

1363
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:51,470
I don't want to fight that guy real quick.

1364
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,170
Which one is the middle one?

1365
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,810
Waiting for old V microwave hallway.

1366
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,310
Middle is super easy.

1367
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,630
Flying thing.

1368
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:07,890
Artemis?

1369
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,720
I'm gonna hold out on getting that because I...

1370
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,720
We'll come back here, no?

1371
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,320
So, I guess we'll try this.

1372
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:32,930
The one that had Lady inside.

1373
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:35,270
Why am I blanking so hard?

1374
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,830
My babies!

1375
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,710
I can get all three of them, right?

1376
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:43,550
Wait, which is which?

1377
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:46,770
Can I get all three of them?

1378
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,590
Pick one?

1379
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:48,210
What is this?

1380
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:48,550
Pokemon!

1381
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:53,850
Uh...

1382
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,290
Pick a cat.

1383
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,990
I can't even tell which one is which.

1384
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,490
I can't tell.

1385
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:06,850
Oh, it's Charmander.

1386
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,230
It tells you if you get close.

1387
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:14,210
Oh!

1388
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:15,170
Free Shadow.

1389
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:17,370
Free Nightmare.

1390
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:18,850
What?

1391
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:20,350
Nightmare would be best, no?

1392
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,090
Free Griffin.

1393
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,970
Or Shadow might be good.

1394
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,160
No, he needs DT.

1395
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,620
You're right.

1396
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,540
I'll do Shadow.

1397
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,470
Oh!

1398
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,570
Oh, she was in the library!

1399
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:06,230
That's right.

1400
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:07,650
Oh, shoot.

1401
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:07,790
Dude.

1402
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:11,990
Wait, this fight might be horrible with Shadow.

1403
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,430
Wait, this fight might be horrible with Shadow.

1404
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,050
Hahaha!

1405
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:15,970
Ah!

1406
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,910
How the hell am I supposed to do this?

1407
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:21,450
Wait.

1408
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:24,350
Oh!

1409
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,770
Actually, Shadow does pretty good damage.

1410
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,050
Go after her!

1411
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,590
Go after her!

1412
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,230
He's...

1413
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,830
We're making some...

1414
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,660
Okay, Shadow.

1415
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,100
Okay.

1416
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,320
Oop!

1417
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,820
Oh, golly!

1418
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,060
If I DT, what happens?

1419
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,670
I am locked on.

1420
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,270
I was locked on.

1421
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:05,090
Hahaha!

1422
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:06,450
Holy cow.

1423
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:09,450
Maybe I'll just...

1424
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:09,790
You know what?

1425
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:10,470
Don't lock on.

1426
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:11,730
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1427
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:13,830
Just do that, Shadow.

1428
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:14,290
That's working.

1429
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:15,310
That's actually working.

1430
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:20,930
Yeah, yeah.

1431
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,090
Keep doing that, Shadow.

1432
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:22,810
Keep doing that.

1433
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:24,210
Oh, shoot.

1434
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:26,410
Just keep going.

1435
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,810
Don't worry about me.

1436
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:29,990
There we go.

1437
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,230
Oh, that was easy.

1438
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:33,450
We're not so...

1439
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,130
Oh, uh...

1440
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:34,990
And then I...

1441
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:35,570
Gotta go in.

1442
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:41,210
Oh, okay.

1443
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:42,930
Get poked.

1444
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:43,550
Hahaha!

1445
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,030
We just were like...

1446
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,330
We literally just poked her.

1447
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,910
Oh my goodness.

1448
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,170
That's so silly.

1449
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,590
So then I should pro...

1450
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,770
I imagine...

1451
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,010
Okay.

1452
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,330
I imagine...

1453
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,430
I'm not gonna...

1454
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,170
Be able to come back here after the third fight.

1455
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:05,970
Unless...

1456
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,050
Like this door opens.

1457
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,670
But we just came out of there, no?

1458
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,990
So I should get Griffin next.

1459
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,030
Right?

1460
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:16,050
So that I can get the Blorb.

1461
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:18,750
Oh, I can come back here!

1462
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,630
Yeah, I don't wanna fight this guy.

1463
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:33,370
He scares me.

1464
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,110
Hahaha!

1465
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,030
Go Cavalier Angelo!

1466
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:41,590
Aw, man.

1467
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,190
Aw, man.

1468
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,250
He's tough.

1469
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,190
This guy is tough.

1470
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:49,710
Okay.

1471
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:50,650
Cav is easy.

1472
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,030
Well, I guess the lady...

1473
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,090
She took like...

1474
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:53,650
What?

1475
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,230
Is Nero just the most weak man ever?

1476
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:56,950
Hahaha!

1477
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:57,770
Wait a second.

1478
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:58,530
Oh no!

1479
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:02,630
I didn't realize and I ate up all the gorbs that are around here.

1480
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,250
Wait, maybe we can find some more.

1481
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:09,390
I ate up all the gorbs that were in here.

1482
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:10,990
There were some in...

1483
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:12,730
What's her name's area too?

1484
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:14,430
I just forgot to put...

1485
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:14,990
Pick them up.

1486
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:17,790
Nero is baby.

1487
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:20,990
Poor guy.

1488
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,770
He felt so strong when he had the grabby grub.

1489
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:27,550
Okay.

1490
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,020
We'll just get some in here maybe.

1491
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:45,980
Okay.

1492
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,180
Cool, I can at least...

1493
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:47,660
Oh my god!

1494
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,220
Already?

1495
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,680
Oh, oh, oh.

1496
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,520
You scared me!

1497
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,800
I thought he was summoned.

1498
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,680
I thought he was summoned.

1499
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,220
Alright, Griffin.

1500
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:54,720
Oh wait.

1501
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,840
Wait, Griffin or...

1502
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,680
Or Nightmare would be better here.

1503
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:07,610
Get the bird.

1504
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:08,930
Okay.

1505
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:12,710
Oh, there he is.

1506
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:17,330
Should let you get the borbs.

1507
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,170
Yeah, yeah.

1508
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,390
Thank you so much for the raid!

1509
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,150
Thank you, thank you.

1510
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:23,150
Bird helps immensely.

1511
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:23,530
Okay.

1512
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:24,430
Let's do it.

1513
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,770
My fingers are ready.

1514
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,470
On X and Y.

1515
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,910
I mean, I guess these guys are just sand too.

1516
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,370
They look like sand just like us.

1517
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:42,690
Oh my god.

1518
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:43,610
Oh my god.

1519
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:47,710
Oh my god.

1520
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:48,710
Did he already die?

1521
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:50,450
Who is...

1522
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:50,910
Who is dead?

1523
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:51,990
Oh my...

1524
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:53,210
Shadow is dead.

1525
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:56,970
Okay.

1526
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,570
He's not doing anything.

1527
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,110
There we go.

1528
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,850
Oh, that's not good.

1529
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:08,350
Yeah.

1530
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:11,990
He's easy, they said.

1531
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,270
Yeah, get his ass.

1532
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:25,090
Oh.

1533
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:28,570
Oh, and this is when he...

1534
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:29,890
Starts charging.

1535
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,610
Go after him!

1536
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,690
Go after him!

1537
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:33,910
Go after him!

1538
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,480
Nice!

1539
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,100
Nice!

1540
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:43,540
Nice!

1541
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,460
Take him out!

1542
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,240
Yeah, take him out!

1543
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:47,840
Where's my bird?

1544
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,500
Oh, there they are.

1545
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,600
Okay, bird's turn.

1546
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,240
Oh.

1547
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:55,860
Woohoo!

1548
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,060
And my bird's dead.

1549
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:13,330
I think Shadow did more of our damage.

1550
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:15,350
Don't teleport.

1551
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:16,110
There we go.

1552
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:22,660
Yeah.

1553
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:23,680
Get his ass.

1554
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,360
Get his ass.

1555
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,480
Yeah, put him to the wall.

1556
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,220
Put him to the wall.

1557
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,180
Put him to the wall.

1558
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,940
Put him to the wall.

1559
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:32,860
Put him to the wall.

1560
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,980
There we go.

1561
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,320
There we go.

1562
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,510
All right!

1563
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,110
The way we aim.

1564
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:55,770
There we go.

1565
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,670
Oh my god!

1566
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,150
That was crazy.

1567
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:01,310
Woo.

1568
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,030
Good job, V.

1569
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,050
We stunlocked him.

1570
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:09,090
Good job, team!

1571
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:11,370
Alright, bird.

1572
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:14,170
I'm counting on... Actually, maybe we should go from, like, here.

1573
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:14,690
Oh, wait.

1574
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,850
Can I... Like, get on top of this.

1575
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:23,370
Thank you.

1576
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,990
Nevermind.

1577
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:30,450
Oh.

1578
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,680
There we go.

1579
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,600
Oh, okay.

1580
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,460
Okay, okay.

1581
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,140
Oh, no.

1582
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:39,620
No!

1583
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,660
I thought we could jump from here.

1584
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,920
Um, maybe not.

1585
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:44,700
Okay, wait.

1586
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,000
Don't forget that standing near them... Orbs revived them past her.

1587
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:53,260
Yeah!

1588
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,940
Why do you think I was standing near them?

1589
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:57,680
I know.

1590
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:58,940
Oh, come on!

1591
01:15:59,120 --> 01:15:59,340
Come on!

1592
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:01,380
Send me up!

1593
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:01,880
Send me!

1594
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,380
Grab me!

1595
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,180
Grab me, bird!

1596
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:03,740
Grab me!

1597
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,140
Grab me!

1598
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:04,440
Grab me!

1599
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:04,820
Grab me!

1600
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:07,760
Hold on.

1601
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,160
Let me try again from over here.

1602
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:11,700
Okay.

1603
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:12,940
Okay.

1604
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:24,740
Let's try... Come on.

1605
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:25,680
Come on.

1606
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,480
I didn't let go that time.

1607
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,240
I didn't let go that time.

1608
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,880
Maybe I can get a little, like, here.

1609
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,040
There we go.

1610
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:37,620
There we go.

1611
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:37,620
Yeah!

1612
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:42,910
Nice.

1613
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:46,610
Okay.

1614
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,670
Was there anything else in the sky that we needed to get?

1615
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,310
I know there were the roars.

1616
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:52,810
Okie dokie.

1617
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,370
I don't think there was anything else.

1618
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,920
Nothing in here.

1619
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,560
Doesn't seem like it.

1620
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:07,960
Alright.

1621
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,220
Our final fight.

1622
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,240
Just that.

1623
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,740
This big ol'.

1624
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,500
This big fella.

1625
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:15,680
Let's go.

1626
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,840
Nightmare time.

1627
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:18,240
Yeah.

1628
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:19,480
We'll summon him.

1629
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,480
We'll summon him and just have him go to town.

1630
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:23,980
Kaiju fight!

1631
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,220
Kaiju fight!

1632
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,120
Do I need health?

1633
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,180
We'll hold off for now.

1634
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,660
So there's that over there and there's some warbs in here too.

1635
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,340
There's two warbs?

1636
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:46,840
There's two warbs?

1637
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,440
Two warbs.

1638
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:04,690
Okay.

1639
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:10,730
Big boy fight.

1640
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,030
It's gold!

1641
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,650
Nightmare!

1642
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,910
The immediate summon.

1643
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,270
Fun.

1644
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:25,930
Oh my god!

1645
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,310
He's really big!

1646
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:27,550
Big!

1647
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:28,990
Holy cow!

1648
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,730
Slice it, of course.

1649
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:32,050
Oh wait.

1650
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:32,730
Where'd the warp go?

1651
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:33,730
Did I already collect it?

1652
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:34,470
Uh oh.

1653
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:35,610
Wait.

1654
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,290
Pin it to the wall.

1655
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:38,250
Uh oh.

1656
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:39,090
Slice it.

1657
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:44,630
You know what?

1658
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:45,510
I'm gonna grab it anyway.

1659
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:47,510
I see the other warp.

1660
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:50,970
I could read.

1661
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,490
Yeah, but this is free and fastest.

1662
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,000
Look, he's already down.

1663
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,700
Look, he's already down.

1664
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:05,900
Oh.

1665
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,320
My turn?

1666
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:26,510
These fights are like redeeming V.

1667
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:27,790
He's so cool in these.

1668
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,430
Yay!

1669
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:31,730
Wow.

1670
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,490
That's the boss rush?

1671
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:34,790
In this game?

1672
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,430
That's it?

1673
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,000
Wow.

1674
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,880
Yeah, they made it so easy.

1675
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,060
Aw.

1676
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,020
Okay.

1677
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,800
Yes sir.

1678
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,050
Oh no.

1679
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,890
The best we avoided if possible.

1680
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:12,450
Especially given my condition.

1681
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:13,510
My condition.

1682
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,010
You feeling better now, buddy?

1683
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:16,790
Oh wait.

1684
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:17,690
Get up.

1685
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:18,450
Nice.

1686
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:19,590
There we go.

1687
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:21,890
And...

1688
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:22,630
Yep.

1689
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:30,410
Oh, dang it.

1690
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:31,690
I didn't mean to double jump.

1691
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,200
I wish it would just work like a skateboard.

1692
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,560
Like I'm playing Tony Hawk.

1693
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,960
And I don't jump off my...

1694
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,280
My skate cat.

1695
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,100
Whoopsie-daisy.

1696
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,300
Alright.

1697
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,620
Soaring the DMC crew!

1698
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,000
Wait a second.

1699
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,360
Where's my pals?

1700
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,640
Where... where am I?

1701
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:02,680
Where are they?

1702
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:03,960
Where is everybody?

1703
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,960
Where are they?

1704
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,540
No time to worry about them, B.

1705
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,740
Wait, I wanna see them!

1706
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,640
I can't even see!

1707
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:18,450
I hear...

1708
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:19,670
I hear so much happening.

1709
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:21,150
But I can't see anything.

1710
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:22,910
Keep going down.

1711
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:23,690
I'm trying.

1712
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,310
Oh wait.

1713
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:34,650
Kill it!

1714
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:35,110
Kill it!

1715
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,870
Slice them into the wall.

1716
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:39,150
Yay!

1717
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:43,470
They're below me, I know!

1718
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:44,650
But I wanna see them!

1719
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,670
I hear them!

1720
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:53,800
I hear them!

1721
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,860
Where are they?

1722
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,990
Is that a mission?

1723
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:08,030
Oh no I didn't.

1724
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:08,870
Sorry.

1725
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:09,450
Got it.

1726
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:09,890
I'm greedy.

1727
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:18,630
Wait, can I see them in here?

1728
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,230
Who is that?

1729
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:23,350
Nero?

1730
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:25,110
Sounds like Nero.

1731
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:36,570
Dead weight.

1732
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,030
You guys are so mean!

1733
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:41,190
You guys are so mean!

1734
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,370
There's a plorb nearby.

1735
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,170
Where at?

1736
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,670
Wait, in here?

1737
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:48,850
Oh.

1738
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,030
What is this?

1739
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:52,150
Oh!

1740
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:52,970
This is for...

1741
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:53,570
Oh my god.

1742
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,610
I can't believe I found a secret mission.

1743
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:01,690
Is it in here?

1744
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:02,250
Stop!

1745
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:02,790
Cat!

1746
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,040
My journey...

1747
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,620
Is coming to an end.

1748
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,920
We're on our own mission.

1749
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,320
Wait, what do you mean by that?

1750
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:21,900
We...

1751
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,200
We...

1752
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,220
If he reaches the fruit, it will all be over.

1753
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,960
Even Moody's failed to reign over the human world.

1754
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,820
Surely no, he will not!

1755
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:40,290
Malfus!

1756
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:42,030
No way can we handle her!

1757
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:43,730
We don't have the strength!

1758
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:45,510
I know.

1759
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:48,690
But we must get through this.

1760
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,430
Somehow...

1761
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:01,070
He's a bit of a weenie.

1762
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:02,190
But I don't blame...

1763
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,290
Oh my god!

1764
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:06,210
The schnoz on that creature!

1765
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:07,570
Ha ha ha ha!

1766
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:11,150
He's like...

1767
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,490
I'm just...

1768
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:15,930
He's like...

1769
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:16,110
No!

1770
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,250
I must keep my V card!

1771
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,190
Chicken Jockey!

1772
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:23,270
Chicken Jockey!

1773
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,010
Niro's here to save the day!

1774
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:30,510
Nice!

1775
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:34,430
Niro to the rescue, baby!

1776
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:36,790
That one was so fast.

1777
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:38,170
That was such a fast mission.

1778
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:39,350
Ha ha ha ha!

1779
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:43,530
Ha ha ha ha!

1780
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:44,970
Damn it!

1781
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,350
Running a little low.

1782
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:47,730
Meanwhile...

1783
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:49,090
It's much longer without a refill.

1784
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:50,250
Yeah...

1785
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,050
Oh!

1786
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,230
I was gonna say...

1787
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:52,610
Where...

1788
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:54,570
Where's the Nico when you need her?

1789
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,250
Hey honey!

1790
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,070
Need assistance?

1791
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,590
What the hell's your problem?

1792
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:00,710
You trying to kill me?

1793
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,610
If you wanna bitch, blame it on lady.

1794
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:04,470
She's behind the wheel.

1795
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,970
I love a lady behind the wheel.

1796
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,030
Ha ha ha!

1797
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,130
She's so cute!

1798
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:11,890
Enough with the suspense!

1799
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:12,810
What do you need?

1800
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:14,690
I like her Lightning McQueen...

1801
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:15,850
Uh...

1802
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:16,290
Head...

1803
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:16,910
Headgear.

1804
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,430
He needs a hand.

1805
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,090
He needs a hand!

1806
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,810
Guys, before we do...

1807
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:27,450
Mission 15, I'm gonna go grab some more water real quick.

1808
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:27,990
I'm so sorry.

1809
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:29,970
I just ran out.

1810
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:33,550
BRB real fast, real fast, real fast.

1811
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:44,810
Sorry about that.

1812
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,410
It took longer than I thought.

1813
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:48,130
Because I committed a sin.

1814
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:51,610
I committed a sin.

1815
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:52,670
Everybody.

1816
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:54,590
My...

1817
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,310
So I have a...

1818
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:56,810
I have like a hot water...

1819
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:58,190
I have a hot water...

1820
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:00,250
Uh...

1821
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,210
It keeps the water hot.

1822
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:03,770
It's like a hot water dispenser.

1823
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:04,970
It keeps the water hot all day.

1824
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:07,950
And I forgot to refill it.

1825
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:09,590
And...

1826
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:10,040
And so I...

1827
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:11,850
What is Lady doing?

1828
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,590
Is she naked?

1829
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:17,650
What is she doing in there?

1830
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:19,470
Oh!

1831
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:20,810
She just took a shower!

1832
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,340
She's like...

1833
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,080
Niko, I need a towel!

1834
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:29,300
Cool!

1835
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,220
Hahaha!

1836
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,220
But um...

1837
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:34,740
Anyway...

1838
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:35,720
I uh...

1839
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,540
I...

1840
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:37,620
I...

1841
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,000
Um...

1842
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:39,960
I...

1843
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,840
Forgot to refill the hot water.

1844
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,980
And so I had to microwave my tea.

1845
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,880
I committed a sin.

1846
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:50,900
All right.

1847
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,280
Mission 15, baby!

1848
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,360
We're back to Nero.

1849
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,460
Oh, golly.

1850
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,200
It's been a while.

1851
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,360
It's been a while since we've played...

1852
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,280
Nero.

1853
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:06,720
Ah...

1854
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,560
Mmm...

1855
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,080
You are not forgiven.

1856
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:09,800
Haha!

1857
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:11,260
How could you?

1858
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,060
I'm sorry!

1859
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:13,680
I'm sorry.

1860
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,780
Minto Lady outfit.

1861
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:16,740
What, naked?

1862
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:17,480
I can't...

1863
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:17,720
Haha!

1864
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,220
Oh my gosh.

1865
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,070
I just noticed Niko's like...

1866
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,360
Her...

1867
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,080
Her...

1868
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:25,480
Her...

1869
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:25,940
Her...

1870
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,340
Tattoo...

1871
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,460
On the...

1872
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,740
Where the...

1873
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:30,660
That...

1874
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:31,780
Wow!

1875
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,500
Oh, I never noticed it before.

1876
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:39,180
I just noticed it...

1877
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:39,840
That one.

1878
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:46,840
Wow.

1879
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:49,240
It's really cute.

1880
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,440
Teeheehee.

1881
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:51,400
Okay.

1882
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,460
Let's see.

1883
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,200
I think I should just give it...

1884
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,540
Get back into it.

1885
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:58,280
I think we can just kinda...

1886
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,280
Have 93,000 Rorbs.

1887
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,940
I think I can just get back into it.

1888
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,320
Look at...

1889
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,580
Oh, I was gonna say I almost have enough for this one.

1890
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:13,320
I don't.

1891
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,920
Minto Womb Tattoo outfit win.

1892
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:31,560
Alright.

1893
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,860
Let's just get back into it.

1894
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,240
Mission...

1895
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,240
Sudato!

1896
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:48,410
Welcome back.

1897
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:53,370
Welcome back...

1898
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:53,970
Back at the...

1899
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:54,690
Nier...

1900
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:56,370
Ruuu...

1901
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:57,690
Alright.

1902
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,690
Thank you mash.

1903
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,580
What the...

1904
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:12,180
Okay?

1905
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,560
Where are you...

1906
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,150
Um...

1907
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,540
Which road should I take?

1908
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:23,400
Uh...

1909
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,200
There's an arm over there.

1910
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,100
Wait, how do I even get to the other path?

1911
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,300
What, do I just drop it down?

1912
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:33,720
No.

1913
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:38,820
He showed a second path and I can't even find...

1914
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:39,440
Oh, it's in there!

1915
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,340
I see, I see it.

1916
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,280
Ah!

1917
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:42,220
I see, I see, I see.

1918
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,280
Um...

1919
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,360
Uh...

1920
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:48,920
Ugh...

1921
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,500
I feel like...

1922
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,780
This would be...

1923
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,520
Better?

1924
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:56,000
But this one has Roarbs.

1925
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,300
Ha ha ha ha!

1926
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:04,210
Porb in the upper, apparently.

1927
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,970
Oh, really?

1928
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,740
Actually?

1929
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:14,180
Spike...

1930
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,920
Spike's is infinitely harder!

1931
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,160
Wait, actually?

1932
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,300
Probably more stuff on the upper path, but it looks more difficult.

1933
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:25,260
That's what I'm thinking.

1934
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:31,830
Hmm...

1935
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:32,590
Reg time!

1936
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,580
Oh, my God!

1937
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:38,960
Ha ha ha ha!

1938
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:41,660
I wish I had Trickster right now.

1939
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,360
I'm sensing, uh...

1940
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,180
Deja Vu here.

1941
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,490
Wait, I can't see.

1942
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:07,790
There we go.

1943
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:12,050
Oh, gosh.

1944
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:13,470
Oh, wait!

1945
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:15,270
Who's down there?

1946
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:17,750
Um, somebody?

1947
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,010
Ooh!

1948
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,210
More rag time?

1949
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:25,530
Oh, gosh.

1950
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:26,730
Why did I take this path?

1951
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:27,970
I'm such an idiot.

1952
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:30,250
Ouch!

1953
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,180
Uh...

1954
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:46,380
Why did I take this...

1955
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:46,920
Oh, my gosh.

1956
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:47,740
Where did you guys come from?

1957
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,020
Yeah.

1958
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:54,100
Wahoo!

1959
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:54,840
Chou chou chou.

1960
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:11,470
How did you recover so fast?

1961
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:14,850
Wait!

1962
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:28,610
Wait, I thought I killed that guy.

1963
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:29,450
Another one showed up?

1964
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:36,470
Ouch.

1965
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:55,570
Whoa, where'd those come from?

1966
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:57,570
Oh...

1967
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,040
Who's got the Wormies?

1968
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:21,270
Wait!

1969
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:23,570
I just got rid of you!

1970
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:23,670
Dude!

1971
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:34,210
Oh, oh, my God.

1972
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:38,710
Use the arms as if I haven't been using Gerbro this entire time like that.

1973
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:41,070
What are you talking about?

1974
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:43,430
Oh, my God.

1975
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:52,710
Oh, shoot.

1976
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:53,210
That sucks.

1977
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:55,710
Oh!

1978
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:57,670
God, I'm gonna die here.

1979
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:09,810
Give me a break, guys.

1980
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:10,710
It's been...

1981
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,690
A minute since we played as Gerro!

1982
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:22,410
Okay.

1983
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:23,270
Wow.

1984
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:24,990
I just wasted all my health.

1985
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:25,830
Oh, my God.

1986
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,090
At least this one...

1987
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:31,510
Is kinda slow.

1988
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:40,610
Okay.

1989
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:42,830
Um...

1990
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,920
I'm trying to get to the Grorbs over there.

1991
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,620
Or not Grorbs, but you know what I mean.

1992
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,140
The healing...

1993
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,040
The healing troop!

1994
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,540
I'm lost!

1995
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:56,920
Okay, game.

1996
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:57,880
Tell me where to go!

1997
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,200
Oh, I'm going the right way.

1998
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:02,060
Oh, oh, oh.

1999
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:02,740
Okay.

2000
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:04,760
Oh, yeah!

2001
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:07,880
How could I forget?

2002
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,680
How could I forget my Rev?

2003
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:14,820
All right.

2004
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,180
There's some coffins.

2005
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:17,760
I saw...

2006
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,080
I saw a Rorb tree up there, but...

2007
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:23,360
I guess this is the other way that we could've gone.

2008
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,740
And this is the way that I chose.

2009
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:41,090
Oh.

2010
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:44,790
Hello.

2011
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:54,830
I think it's the first time we've...

2012
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,080
No!

2013
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:05,280
You waited!

2014
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,340
You waited!

2015
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,900
You waited.

2016
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,520
I know you did.

2017
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:10,060
Oh, my God.

2018
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,080
Move, Nero!

2019
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:30,590
Let's get airborne.

2020
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:35,820
No, please!

2021
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,960
Oh, that's so unfair.

2022
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:41,680
Let's get airborne.

2023
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:53,090
No, no, no.

2024
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:56,350
I tried to leave, but I was airborne.

2025
01:39:58,330 --> 01:39:59,610
It's okay, I'll just restart.

2026
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,050
All right.

2027
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:11,750
They completely waited for me to be on the ground.

2028
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,590
To do their spinny attack.

2029
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:15,270
Those assholes!

2030
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:19,190
Where am I?

2031
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:19,550
Oh!

2032
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:20,990
I have to do it all over again!

2033
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:23,130
Fair enough.

2034
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:25,010
Fair enough.

2035
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,590
Understandable.

2036
01:40:26,590 --> 01:40:27,350
Oh, thank you.

2037
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:30,490
We'll go the other way.

2038
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,510
We'll go this way.

2039
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:37,530
Cross route.

2040
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:39,430
Which way should I go?

2041
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,610
Yeah.

2042
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,170
Oh, hello.

2043
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:53,150
Um.

2044
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,790
But like...

2045
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:56,290
How do I get across?

2046
01:40:58,290 --> 01:40:59,430
Where are they fighting?

2047
01:40:59,810 --> 01:40:59,950
Oh.

2048
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:01,990
Hello?

2049
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:10,430
Stinger from the ledge?

2050
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:18,030
Like that?

2051
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:20,090
Can I...

2052
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:20,690
After it, hold on.

2053
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:23,350
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2054
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,390
Okay.

2055
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:26,110
No, I can't jump.

2056
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:30,670
What is it?

2057
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,050
Oh, it's giving me Gerbera.

2058
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:32,830
So...

2059
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:33,870
Maybe I'll use that.

2060
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:35,710
Hold on, let me practice a minute.

2061
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:39,730
Like that.

2062
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:40,710
Okay, okay, okay.

2063
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:00,710
It's down here.

2064
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:03,950
Can I even make it over there?

2065
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:06,310
Leviticard, thank you so...

2066
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:07,770
Much for the...

2067
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:08,390
Gifted!

2068
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,330
Okay.

2069
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:14,750
What's even down there?

2070
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:16,830
Little losers.

2071
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,180
Uh...

2072
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:22,680
Nice.

2073
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,330
Uh...

2074
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:28,260
Whoa!

2075
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,120
Oh, it's a freaking...

2076
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:33,560
Five!

2077
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:40,310
I love DMC too!

2078
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:47,570
I love DMC too!

2079
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:54,240
I'm not going over there.

2080
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:01,570
Wait, what's down there?

2081
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:04,930
Yeah, there you go.

2082
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:06,870
Wait, what is that?

2083
01:43:11,970 --> 01:43:13,070
Wait, what is that?

2084
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:18,530
Oh, it's just lighting?

2085
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,390
Oh, okay.

2086
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,230
Haha.

2087
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:21,270
That's funny.

2088
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:24,990
Oh, shoot.

2089
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:25,250
Oh.

2090
01:43:26,230 --> 01:43:26,770
Yup!

2091
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:27,450
Oh, yeah!

2092
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:28,930
Okay.

2093
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:31,290
Heh heh.

2094
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,490
Heh heh heh heh heh.

2095
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:33,190
Heh heh.

2096
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,600
Oh, another freaking mat.

2097
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,500
Freaking mat.

2098
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:58,190
I know it probably wants me to like, stay in the air and use Gerbera to stay in the air and...

2099
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,610
Uh, like, you know, do all that stuff.

2100
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:04,450
But...

2101
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:05,850
I refuse to listen.

2102
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:07,570
I

2103
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,390
have a gun, so...

2104
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:18,610
Oh, golly.

2105
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,730
Platforming.

2106
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:20,270
Okay.

2107
01:44:22,110 --> 01:44:24,010
Some wasted Rorbs, but that's okay.

2108
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:24,450
You know what?

2109
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:29,410
I've already...

2110
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:30,570
I've already Gerbera'd.

2111
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:32,510
Oh.

2112
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,140
Okay.

2113
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:41,820
Oh my god!

2114
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:42,900
Where did you come from?

2115
01:44:47,770 --> 01:44:48,550
Don't do it!

2116
01:44:48,930 --> 01:44:49,650
Don't do it!

2117
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:50,470
Wait, I'm lost?

2118
01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:53,170
It's okay.

2119
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:54,330
There's a tree right there.

2120
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,000
The MC2.

2121
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:09,890
Glib.

2122
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:20,250
Oh.

2123
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:20,930
Oh my god.

2124
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:21,310
Oh!

2125
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:22,470
Oh my god.

2126
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:24,290
I had shot instead.

2127
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:29,820
The Rorbs.

2128
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,000
It's fine.

2129
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,820
We win some, we lose some.

2130
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:37,740
Where are you taking me?

2131
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,320
What's over here?

2132
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,340
Oh, nothing's over here.

2133
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:39,780
Alright.

2134
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:41,480
Oh.

2135
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:42,300
Send me.

2136
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,100
Where am I?

2137
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:50,400
Why does this one feel so much longer than the other one though?

2138
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:18,790
Yeah, get away from me.

2139
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:19,490
Come here.

2140
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:20,510
Oh, that's me.

2141
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:21,230
Oh my gosh.

2142
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:26,310
What are you doing?

2143
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:38,150
Come here.

2144
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:41,970
Yeah, that's right.

2145
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:45,650
Yeah, that's right.

2146
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:45,770
Yeah, that's right.

2147
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:46,750
Come here.

2148
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:51,790
Stop it.

2149
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:52,910
Stop.

2150
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:55,870
Are you winning?

2151
01:46:58,150 --> 01:46:58,530
I don't know.

2152
01:46:58,670 --> 01:46:59,170
What are you guys saying?

2153
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:00,090
Oh my gosh.

2154
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:00,710
Where'd you come from?

2155
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:04,430
Go away.

2156
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:04,950
Actually.

2157
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:31,570
We got him.

2158
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:34,650
We got him.

2159
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,670
We got him.

2160
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:39,370
We got him.

2161
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,880
Divinity statue.

2162
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:55,620
What if I didn't make that?

2163
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:56,420
Okay.

2164
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:57,720
That's death, I suppose.

2165
01:47:58,100 --> 01:47:58,200
Haha.

2166
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,200
Umm.

2167
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:04,010
Umm.

2168
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:06,710
What's over here?

2169
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:09,550
I...

2170
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:10,570
I...

2171
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:12,070
I don't want that to happen.

2172
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:12,490
No.

2173
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,450
Dante has like crazy skills now.

2174
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:16,150
Nero, you need to shut up.

2175
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:19,030
Nero, you need to know your place.

2176
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:20,170
Buddy.

2177
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:20,950
Buddy.

2178
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:21,350
O pal.

2179
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:22,050
Friend of mine.

2180
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,250
The ice guys again.

2181
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:37,420
Nero is way over his head.

2182
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:39,580
No.

2183
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:45,940
Stop it.

2184
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,180
You're not allowed.

2185
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:01,110
You're not allowed to do your stinky moves.

2186
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:02,810
These things are pathetic.

2187
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:07,250
As soon as you start hitting them, they absolutely stop fighting you.

2188
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:16,720
This one's a treat.

2189
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:20,180
Hot dog?

2190
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,520
What time is a hot dog?

2191
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:27,400
Hey, maybe it's my best friend Boris' birthday today.

2192
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,020
Could you say hot dog for him?

2193
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,620
Boris, happy birthday!

2194
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:33,320
Hot dog.

2195
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,320
Heck yeah.

2196
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:44,360
This is the other one.

2197
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:45,940
Little circle.

2198
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:47,440
Okay, onwards.

2199
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:57,290
Was the other way just so much shorter because I fell?

2200
01:49:57,590 --> 01:49:58,070
Or...

2201
01:49:58,070 --> 01:50:00,110
Is this just the longest way possible?

2202
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:01,630
Or...

2203
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:02,230
Am I...

2204
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:04,530
Gonna ignore that coffin area completely?

2205
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:05,790
I'm so confused.

2206
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:10,870
Rawhide.

2207
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:12,750
That's the whip, right?

2208
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:16,730
Ah, this again.

2209
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:49,290
It was a trap.

2210
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:51,310
It was a trap.

2211
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:51,970
It was a trap.

2212
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:52,890
It was a trap!

2213
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:05,560
Holy cow.

2214
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:18,230
Oh.

2215
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:27,270
Where'd he go?

2216
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:27,630
Oh.

2217
01:51:27,950 --> 01:51:28,550
Come here.

2218
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:29,870
Oh, I can't.

2219
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:32,670
Yeah.

2220
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:33,950
Yeah.

2221
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:35,070
Yeah.

2222
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:36,890
What'd you try to do, huh?

2223
01:51:37,450 --> 01:51:37,750
Oh.

2224
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:38,270
Oh shoot.

2225
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:41,170
You didn't try to do anything.

2226
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:45,390
Right now.

2227
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:46,570
Oop.

2228
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:47,430
Let's get airport.

2229
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:47,910
Oop.

2230
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:49,250
Right now.

2231
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:49,730
Yep.

2232
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:51,230
We'll get it.

2233
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:53,050
We'll get it.

2234
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:55,610
I'm pressing left trigger.

2235
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:56,550
Why aren't you even trying?

2236
01:51:56,930 --> 01:51:57,450
There we go.

2237
01:51:58,710 --> 01:51:59,750
There we go.

2238
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:04,770
Did he just despawn?

2239
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:05,510
It might have...

2240
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:06,310
Maybe?

2241
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:07,090
Hahaha.

2242
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:11,150
Alright.

2243
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:14,230
There's a bunch of goop on the ground.

2244
01:52:18,210 --> 01:52:19,650
Me thinks...

2245
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,010
I don't know what me thinks.

2246
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,160
Me thinks...

2247
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,860
Things will come out of said...

2248
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:28,740
I knew it.

2249
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:29,200
Oh my god.

2250
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,240
I was going to say me thinks.

2251
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:33,400
It's the lady bug that gets aggroed.

2252
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:34,460
The queen.

2253
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:35,920
Oh my god.

2254
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:36,940
Oh my god.

2255
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:49,430
Let's get airport.

2256
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:51,750
Right now.

2257
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:52,170
Ah.

2258
01:52:58,270 --> 01:52:59,070
Let's get airport.

2259
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:00,390
Oh, I didn't even...

2260
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:00,690
Heh.

2261
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:03,230
Right now.

2262
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:03,630
Ugh.

2263
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:08,590
Oh, he's dead.

2264
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,530
Maybe she's not here.

2265
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:11,550
Maybe I lied.

2266
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:13,410
Oh, there's more coming.

2267
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:16,990
Oh.

2268
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:18,450
Yeah, you.

2269
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:19,590
Wait, come here.

2270
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:20,150
Come here.

2271
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:20,810
Come here.

2272
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:26,130
Come here.

2273
01:53:26,290 --> 01:53:26,730
Come here.

2274
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:27,150
Come here.

2275
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:27,310
Oh.

2276
01:53:27,670 --> 01:53:28,550
I guess we'll just do that.

2277
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:33,570
Oh.

2278
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:34,090
Oh.

2279
01:53:34,410 --> 01:53:34,490
Oh.

2280
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:39,370
Hey, what are you doing?

2281
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:42,130
No!

2282
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:43,690
Bang!

2283
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:56,920
Burn my double trigger!

2284
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:01,430
Oh!

2285
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:02,490
There she is.

2286
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:18,600
No!

2287
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:19,980
Don't do it!

2288
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:25,510
On my double trigger!

2289
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:33,210
Ouch!

2290
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:34,050
Oh, shoot.

2291
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:40,370
Oh no, that one's it.

2292
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:40,770
Oh no.

2293
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:42,630
Oh no, that one's... Oh no.

2294
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:44,010
I knew it.

2295
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:45,970
I knew it was gonna be like this.

2296
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:47,110
So I knew it.

2297
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:54,950
Okay, we got her.

2298
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:55,390
Nice.

2299
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:57,410
Okay, that's one at least.

2300
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:01,730
But she becomes so aggroed.

2301
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:08,210
Oh, shoot.

2302
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:09,210
That sucks.

2303
01:55:16,670 --> 01:55:17,210
Okay.

2304
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:17,990
Don't, don't.

2305
01:55:18,110 --> 01:55:18,250
Oh.

2306
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:20,110
Come on!

2307
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:21,590
You bitch!

2308
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:23,110
I can't even see you.

2309
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:23,490
Please.

2310
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:26,610
Damn.

2311
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:28,730
Oh, it's Tomboy.

2312
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:40,890
Oh, oops.

2313
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:41,670
Turn it off.

2314
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,520
Yeah!

2315
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,160
There we go.

2316
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:53,660
Wow!

2317
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:08,590
Yippee!

2318
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:13,410
Anything up here?

2319
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:16,990
It's so squishy.

2320
01:56:20,650 --> 01:56:21,450
Alright.

2321
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:22,910
Doesn't seem like anything.

2322
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,290
Pull my Mickey Trigger!

2323
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:35,400
Oh, here.

2324
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:37,720
Oh, here.

2325
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:39,460
Yeah, thank you.

2326
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:44,200
Gosh, we have so many Roarbs now.

2327
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:49,500
So...

2328
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,780
Where the heck am I?

2329
01:56:58,030 --> 01:56:58,630
Okay.

2330
01:56:59,110 --> 01:56:59,490
Okay.

2331
01:56:59,810 --> 01:57:00,090
Understandable.

2332
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:02,230
Yeah, I know Tomboy's still on.

2333
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:03,370
It's okay.

2334
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:05,170
There's no reason to turn it off, is there?

2335
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:07,690
Oh, another Tomboy!

2336
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:10,690
Lucky day.

2337
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:59,550
Did we kill him?

2338
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:01,330
Is there anything left?

2339
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:03,730
That's it.

2340
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:05,910
Good...

2341
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:06,530
Goodness.

2342
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,550
Okay.

2343
01:58:11,890 --> 01:58:12,410
Onwards.

2344
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:13,990
Wait, what is this for though?

2345
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:16,910
Oh, if I wanna go up there.

2346
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:19,830
Well, what is up there?

2347
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:23,870
Another Tomboy!

2348
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:25,630
Wait.

2349
01:58:25,630 --> 01:58:25,730
Okay.

2350
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:28,730
Um...

2351
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:29,890
Wait, did it just spawn more?

2352
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:33,930
Or...

2353
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:34,850
Something.

2354
01:58:35,070 --> 01:58:35,330
Somewhere.

2355
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:36,450
Up there?

2356
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:37,070
I think?

2357
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:40,030
Do I need to go over there?

2358
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:42,010
Or do I go this way?

2359
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:43,390
Let's see what this way is first.

2360
01:58:43,570 --> 01:58:44,870
It might be a dead end, but...

2361
01:58:44,870 --> 01:58:45,130
What?

2362
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:49,530
Starring me?

2363
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:51,270
Where am I?

2364
01:58:51,770 --> 01:58:52,030
Oh.

2365
01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:57,490
Ah!

2366
01:58:58,130 --> 01:58:59,570
It's gonna show me as V!

2367
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:14,950
And then I'm fighting this thing.

2368
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:16,850
Oh golly.

2369
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:22,620
Oh my god.

2370
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:38,540
I don't think our Nero was doing this much.

2371
01:59:42,570 --> 01:59:43,970
What the hell is this thing?

2372
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:49,170
I don't think Nero in the cutscene was doing all of...

2373
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:50,530
Or not cutscene, but you know what I mean?

2374
01:59:51,590 --> 01:59:53,750
I don't think he was doing all of this!

2375
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:00,290
Nice!

2376
02:00:09,070 --> 02:00:09,930
Oh!

2377
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:14,590
Tomboy is so great!

2378
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:16,990
I love Tomboy!

2379
02:00:20,450 --> 02:00:22,110
Oh wait, who's that?

2380
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,230
Oh!

2381
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:28,530
Is that V?

2382
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:32,210
Me?

2383
02:00:34,010 --> 02:00:35,070
I sure think so.

2384
02:00:40,710 --> 02:00:41,330
Oh, where?

2385
02:00:41,650 --> 02:00:41,810
Oh!

2386
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:49,580
What'd you say?

2387
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:50,380
What'd you say?

2388
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,020
Oh, there he goes.

2389
02:00:57,630 --> 02:00:58,430
Me as...

2390
02:00:58,430 --> 02:00:59,510
Is that me as Dante?

2391
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:01,050
I'm still curious.

2392
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:03,190
What if I went up over in this area?

2393
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:04,150
I wonder if I still can.

2394
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:07,690
What's up here instead?

2395
02:01:08,190 --> 02:01:08,350
You know?

2396
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:10,050
But I didn't want to miss out.

2397
02:01:11,470 --> 02:01:12,050
Let's see.

2398
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:13,010
Oh, it was AI.

2399
02:01:13,470 --> 02:01:13,910
Aw, boo.

2400
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:16,150
What can I say?

2401
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:17,090
I don't remember playing.

2402
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:20,730
Oh, gosh.

2403
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:22,250
What's...

2404
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:22,890
Is it worth it?

2405
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:37,640
Oh, my God.

2406
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:38,660
Oh, gosh.

2407
02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:48,170
Oh.

2408
02:01:48,570 --> 02:01:48,670
No.

2409
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:48,910
Okay.

2410
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:49,570
Pull this guy.

2411
02:01:49,630 --> 02:01:49,910
There we go.

2412
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,380
That's what I was...

2413
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:00,880
That's what I figured was gonna happen.

2414
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:06,220
I'll save it.

2415
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,880
My Tomboy!

2416
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:10,400
My Tomboy!

2417
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:17,120
My Tomboy!

2418
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:19,440
I hate Hellbat.

2419
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:28,390
I see...

2420
02:02:28,390 --> 02:02:28,810
Oh, my God.

2421
02:02:28,830 --> 02:02:29,910
I knew it was gonna happen again.

2422
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:31,610
I'm not even gonna...

2423
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:36,250
Come here.

2424
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:42,450
I knew it was gonna happen.

2425
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:44,070
I knew it!

2426
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:47,150
I have tried the gun and I don't like the Tomboy gun.

2427
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:49,090
I do not like the Tomboy gun.

2428
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:51,770
Because I can't aim it very well.

2429
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:52,350
Ow!

2430
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:54,570
Oh, my God.

2431
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:55,250
He's gonna explode!

2432
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:14,460
Tomboy gun.

2433
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:16,140
It's too difficult for me to...

2434
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:17,610
Any kind of those guns that, like...

2435
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:19,000
That...

2436
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,420
You have to, like...

2437
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:21,560
This is gonna sound so bad.

2438
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,400
Any of those guns that you have to aim?

2439
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:26,000
But you know what I mean?

2440
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,400
Like, they shoot big ol' lasers.

2441
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:28,580
And...

2442
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:31,160
You have to, like, be really precise with them.

2443
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:36,460
But you know what I mean?

2444
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:39,900
Oh.

2445
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:42,840
We got a blur, baby!

2446
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:44,240
Nice.

2447
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:45,920
Maybe it was worth.

2448
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:47,620
Does this go back down?

2449
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:48,260
Oh.

2450
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:49,140
I sure hope so.

2451
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,700
The answer is...

2452
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:52,760
Yes!

2453
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:53,900
Perfect.

2454
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:57,380
Aiming with controller is a pain.

2455
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:57,920
Yeah!

2456
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:01,440
So it's just...

2457
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,420
Not my favorite.

2458
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:04,660
I thought I turned the motion blur off.

2459
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:06,700
Do you guys see it?

2460
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:14,870
I thought I turned it off.

2461
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:23,650
Bit rate not helping.

2462
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:24,190
Oh, sorry.

2463
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:26,030
This area is probably bit rate hell, huh?

2464
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:35,230
So cute!

2465
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:37,350
Thank you!

2466
02:04:41,590 --> 02:04:42,550
Licorice land.

2467
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:46,890
I don't like black licorice, though.

2468
02:04:49,790 --> 02:04:50,190
Oh.

2469
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:50,790
Hello.

2470
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:51,590
Oh.

2471
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:52,390
Nero.

2472
02:04:52,570 --> 02:04:53,230
You got this.

2473
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:53,850
There you go, buddy.

2474
02:04:55,210 --> 02:04:56,470
What are you a pal of mine?

2475
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:02,690
Nothing but an invisible wall.

2476
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:05,170
Nice.

2477
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:07,150
Oh.

2478
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:08,130
I didn't mean to do that.

2479
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:11,290
Um...

2480
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:15,770
I still don't think I'm gonna...

2481
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:16,550
What's...

2482
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:17,170
What are we at right now?

2483
02:05:17,230 --> 02:05:18,790
What's our magazine looking like?

2484
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:19,990
We have one tomboy.

2485
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:23,670
What is our health...

2486
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:24,310
Not health or skeleton.

2487
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:25,050
Ragtot...

2488
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:25,350
Rag...

2489
02:05:25,930 --> 02:05:26,350
Rawhide!

2490
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:29,030
Uh...

2491
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,710
What's this one?

2492
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:30,630
What's the blue one?

2493
02:05:32,330 --> 02:05:32,750
Overture.

2494
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:34,230
That's just like the regular one, no?

2495
02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:40,750
One tomboy on standby?

2496
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:42,150
I guess we could.

2497
02:05:49,790 --> 02:05:51,230
Tomboy, I feel...

2498
02:05:51,230 --> 02:05:52,030
For me...

2499
02:05:52,030 --> 02:05:53,310
For my fighting...

2500
02:05:53,890 --> 02:05:55,510
I use it depending on the...

2501
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:56,130
I was...

2502
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:59,250
I thought it was definitely gonna break with those big ol' machete guys.

2503
02:05:59,410 --> 02:05:59,970
But it didn't.

2504
02:06:00,430 --> 02:06:00,890
You know?

2505
02:06:01,850 --> 02:06:02,450
It...

2506
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:03,490
I was shocked.

2507
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:04,690
I was shocked!

2508
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:07,750
Um...

2509
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:08,370
But sure.

2510
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:09,050
I'll buy one.

2511
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,140
We'll put her in.

2512
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:17,220
Put me in, coach!

2513
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,200
Oh, and I'm gonna put a Gerbera at the end.

2514
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,400
Wait, but what if I find another gun?

2515
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:22,020
You know what?

2516
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:22,720
I'll put this one away.

2517
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:24,680
Wait.

2518
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:26,600
There we go.

2519
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:33,950
Here we go.

2520
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:39,410
No...

2521
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:40,290
Yeah.

2522
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:42,170
Hehe.

2523
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:47,450
I'll crush you.

2524
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:48,310
Oh...

2525
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:51,850
I'm coming...

2526
02:06:51,850 --> 02:06:53,330
Oh, this is where we say V!

2527
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:53,670
Okay.

2528
02:06:54,110 --> 02:06:54,610
That's funny.

2529
02:06:55,170 --> 02:06:55,450
Heheh.

2530
02:07:06,730 --> 02:07:10,930
But you're nothing more than an empty shell with no power.

2531
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:14,530
You are as weak as your flesh.

2532
02:07:15,690 --> 02:07:16,430
Human.

2533
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:20,330
Chicken jockey.

2534
02:07:21,070 --> 02:07:22,650
And we're in an arena.

2535
02:07:22,910 --> 02:07:24,210
This is so perfect.

2536
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:33,200
Poor Nero is always being called weak.

2537
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:39,080
Before I use my...

2538
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:42,720
Ouch.

2539
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:44,780
What are you throwing at me?

2540
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:50,860
You stink.

2541
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:55,200
Oh gosh, I keep trying to get out of the way of that.

2542
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:59,560
What are you, what are you trying to, what'd you throw at me?

2543
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,680
Oh, you threw me a...

2544
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:09,590
Thank you.

2545
02:08:09,770 --> 02:08:10,270
Oh, okay.

2546
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:11,090
Oh, shoot.

2547
02:08:11,790 --> 02:08:13,330
I haven't used this one very much.

2548
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:24,800
Ah, gosh.

2549
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:25,840
Gets me every time.

2550
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:43,950
Oh, where'd she go?

2551
02:08:44,510 --> 02:08:45,330
Failure attempt.

2552
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:49,330
B lended me a hand.

2553
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:51,790
B lended me a hand.

2554
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:56,130
What are you throwing me now?

2555
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:58,150
Wait, how do I...

2556
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:05,470
I wanna use... I wanna time her out when she comes back.

2557
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:08,110
Okay, here we go.

2558
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:09,810
Okay, here we go.

2559
02:09:10,430 --> 02:09:10,910
Now?

2560
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:12,130
There we go.

2561
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:12,430
Oh.

2562
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:14,450
Wow, that was the worst...

2563
02:09:14,450 --> 02:09:15,810
...time to use it.

2564
02:09:16,050 --> 02:09:17,010
Wait, where'd she go?

2565
02:09:17,010 --> 02:09:17,070
No.

2566
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:26,610
That sucks.

2567
02:09:33,530 --> 02:09:35,890
Ugh, I don't know how to avoid that.

2568
02:09:36,070 --> 02:09:37,370
I'm just like too close to her.

2569
02:09:40,350 --> 02:09:40,890
Wait.

2570
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:43,310
Can

2571
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:47,980
I...

2572
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:48,360
Uh, wait.

2573
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:48,820
Oh God.

2574
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:49,960
How do I...

2575
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:06,440
Oh gosh.

2576
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:07,900
Oh my God.

2577
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,120
Wait.

2578
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:12,020
Oh my God.

2579
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:13,540
Oh my God.

2580
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:17,170
Ah.

2581
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:20,870
I'm not gonna make this one, probably.

2582
02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:21,510
Most likely.

2583
02:10:23,290 --> 02:10:23,690
But...

2584
02:10:47,010 --> 02:10:47,410
Futile.

2585
02:10:47,490 --> 02:10:48,170
Oh, she says futile.

2586
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:50,630
I was like, what do you mean failed attempt?

2587
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:51,990
I don't know.

2588
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:05,950
Gosh, I only... I almost wanna use a Gorb.

2589
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:10,460
But it's okay.

2590
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:12,340
Okay.

2591
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:12,840
Try again.

2592
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,380
Nice try though.

2593
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:17,860
Yeah.

2594
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:20,240
We'll try again.

2595
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,100
As long as...

2596
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,940
I just worry that it's gonna take us so back...

2597
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:24,460
Like further back in the, uh...

2598
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:26,260
In the...

2599
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:28,720
Like the checkpoint is kinda far back, but...

2600
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:29,180
Oh!

2601
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:30,440
See, it's not so bad actually.

2602
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:34,720
I don't...

2603
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,100
Yeah, yeah.

2604
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:35,600
It's right here.

2605
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:37,300
Get in my way and I'll crush you.

2606
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:37,760
Yeah, yeah.

2607
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:38,240
Okay, okay.

2608
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:42,140
Ah, too bad.

2609
02:11:45,860 --> 02:11:46,340
Okay.

2610
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:48,240
Alright.

2611
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:51,520
He gave us a arm, but I don't know where it is.

2612
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:04,950
Futile attempt.

2613
02:12:17,350 --> 02:12:18,270
Where's the arm?

2614
02:12:19,130 --> 02:12:20,210
Oh, he hasn't throw...

2615
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:20,610
Wait, no.

2616
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:22,010
He throws it to me in the cutscene, no?

2617
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:22,810
Hahaha.

2618
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:26,930
Oh, oh!

2619
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:28,010
Oh, I got his butt!

2620
02:12:30,930 --> 02:12:31,810
Whoops!

2621
02:12:38,070 --> 02:12:38,890
Ah, damn.

2622
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:44,840
Whoa!

2623
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:46,220
Whoa!

2624
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:49,060
Whoa!

2625
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:50,280
Whoa!

2626
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:54,440
Oh, damn!

2627
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:56,960
I lost him!

2628
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:58,140
Oh, dang it.

2629
02:12:58,460 --> 02:12:59,020
I lost him.

2630
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:10,740
Oh, there he goes.

2631
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:12,300
Thank you!

2632
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:15,560
Oh my god.

2633
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:16,480
Oh, wow!

2634
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:17,880
Not the time, B, please!

2635
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:18,420
Not the time!

2636
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:19,080
Not the time!

2637
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:20,460
No, I'm stuck!

2638
02:13:20,580 --> 02:13:20,900
I'm stuck!

2639
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:21,300
I'm stuck!

2640
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:23,280
This is ass.

2641
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:23,920
This is...

2642
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:24,840
Wait, this is so unfair.

2643
02:13:25,060 --> 02:13:26,080
What is happening?!

2644
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:28,060
I'm stuck!

2645
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:28,240
Look!

2646
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:33,400
I...

2647
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,080
What?!

2648
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:35,840
What just happened?!

2649
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:41,660
I was completely stunlocked!

2650
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:43,320
I was completely stunlocked!

2651
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:47,400
Oh!

2652
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:49,520
That's so unfair!

2653
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:53,000
Oh!

2654
02:13:55,240 --> 02:13:56,360
Oh!

2655
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:56,500
No!

2656
02:13:57,460 --> 02:13:57,880
Hahaha!

2657
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:04,540
Okay...

2658
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:05,600
That's fine.

2659
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:08,180
That's fine.

2660
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:08,640
Yeah, we...

2661
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,300
It was rigged.

2662
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:10,680
It was rigged!

2663
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:13,820
Chicken...

2664
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:16,320
Combo...

2665
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:20,300
Huh...

2666
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:24,120
I didn't even get to grab the arm that he threw at me.

2667
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:27,400
Okay...

2668
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:31,240
Okay...

2669
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:32,260
Dang!

2670
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:36,320
I felt like I was not doing poorly if I wasn't doing so bad that time, too.

2671
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:37,000
Oh!

2672
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:37,820
Ah!

2673
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,260
Try it.

2674
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:40,840
I don't...

2675
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:41,300
No, V...

2676
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:41,620
Don't...

2677
02:14:41,620 --> 02:14:42,540
I don't fucking trust you.

2678
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:43,520
I don't want you to touch me.

2679
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:44,220
Don't...

2680
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:44,560
Don't...

2681
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,820
I don't wanna hear it.

2682
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:46,660
Don't throw...

2683
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:47,480
Don't give me anything!

2684
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:53,320
Wait, get out of the way.

2685
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:55,300
Oh!

2686
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:57,420
Oh, I'm trying to get the rag time, but I...

2687
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:59,040
The camera keeps changing on me.

2688
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:24,260
Oh, there it is!

2689
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:29,220
Hahaha!

2690
02:15:33,220 --> 02:15:34,000
Oh gosh.

2691
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:34,520
Okay.

2692
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:37,690
This will do just fine.

2693
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:44,630
Yeah.

2694
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:49,570
Oh...

2695
02:15:49,570 --> 02:15:49,930
Wait.

2696
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:51,310
What do you...

2697
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:52,290
What did you just throw at me?

2698
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:53,370
Wait, I'm stuck again.

2699
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:54,850
No, please.

2700
02:15:55,070 --> 02:15:56,050
No, please, God, no!

2701
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:57,250
No, no, no, please!

2702
02:15:57,490 --> 02:15:58,370
Please, please, please!

2703
02:15:58,670 --> 02:15:59,170
Please, please, please!

2704
02:15:59,170 --> 02:15:59,870
Please, please, please, please!

2705
02:16:09,930 --> 02:16:11,570
I can't grab onto it!

2706
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:12,090
Oh my God!

2707
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:17,690
Oh my God!

2708
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:30,440
Okay.

2709
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:34,060
I have to be able to grab the arm...

2710
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,240
Before it starts raging.

2711
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:37,160
Before it starts raging.

2712
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:38,200
And then maybe...

2713
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:40,540
Get out of the way.

2714
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:42,380
Or...

2715
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:44,000
Stop it.

2716
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:44,460
Oh.

2717
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:45,800
Oh.

2718
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:47,760
Oh my God.

2719
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,540
I was trying to grab onto it.

2720
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:50,060
To like...

2721
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,620
To, you know, like...

2722
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:54,640
Get on top of it.

2723
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:55,360
But...

2724
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:56,580
It would not let me.

2725
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:58,080
So...

2726
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:58,700
That's...

2727
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:00,780
Not something you can do.

2728
02:17:01,060 --> 02:17:02,020
I have learned.

2729
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:09,090
And rack time is such ass...

2730
02:17:09,090 --> 02:17:09,510
Oh my God.

2731
02:17:09,690 --> 02:17:10,030
I'm dead.

2732
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:11,550
Because I...

2733
02:17:11,550 --> 02:17:12,030
It doesn't...

2734
02:17:12,030 --> 02:17:13,890
It just shoots the bubbles randomly.

2735
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:17,390
So I don't like it.

2736
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:34,530
It's useful when the boss is stunned.

2737
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:36,350
It's like...

2738
02:17:37,050 --> 02:17:38,510
If I can aim it...

2739
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:41,050
Then it's...

2740
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:41,490
Not fine.

2741
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:42,430
Or not bad.

2742
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:43,890
I get...

2743
02:17:43,890 --> 02:17:45,590
I get why he's throwing it at me.

2744
02:17:45,870 --> 02:17:47,130
It's for when he starts...

2745
02:17:47,130 --> 02:17:48,130
I have to do the...

2746
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:48,770
Charged attack.

2747
02:17:48,930 --> 02:17:49,270
So...

2748
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:50,570
I can avoid the...

2749
02:17:50,570 --> 02:17:52,510
I can avoid it when it's...

2750
02:17:53,630 --> 02:17:54,510
Running at me.

2751
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:55,190
I'm pretty sure.

2752
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:57,590
I'm pretty sure that's why he throws it at me.

2753
02:18:00,370 --> 02:18:00,810
Oh.

2754
02:18:00,870 --> 02:18:01,070
Oh.

2755
02:18:01,070 --> 02:18:02,050
That's not what I wanted to do.

2756
02:18:02,970 --> 02:18:03,770
Oh my God.

2757
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:12,280
Oh.

2758
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:13,260
Trying to leave.

2759
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:14,440
I'm trying to...

2760
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:15,360
Please.

2761
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:15,800
Please.

2762
02:18:16,020 --> 02:18:16,680
Get me out of here.

2763
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:23,760
I hate that cutscene.

2764
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:26,120
It throws me out of the...

2765
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:27,480
Groove so much.

2766
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,460
It's so bad.

2767
02:18:29,060 --> 02:18:30,780
Why is there a cutscene for him to...

2768
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:32,100
In the middle of a boss battle?

2769
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,140
And now I'm fucking stuck.

2770
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:34,240
Please let me leave.

2771
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:37,220
It's so bad.

2772
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:39,380
It's so awful.

2773
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:42,400
Why is there a cutscene in the middle of a boss battle?

2774
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:44,400
When did I become punchline?

2775
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:48,080
Uh oh.

2776
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:48,600
Oh no.

2777
02:18:48,780 --> 02:18:49,400
I didn't get it.

2778
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:50,600
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

2779
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:51,740
I didn't get it.

2780
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:52,800
No, no, no.

2781
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:53,560
No.

2782
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:57,320
I'm trying to leave.

2783
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:58,300
I'm trying to get out.

2784
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:00,620
Okay.

2785
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:01,920
Oh God.

2786
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:02,300
Oh God.

2787
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:02,780
Oh God.

2788
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:03,040
Oh God.

2789
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:03,440
Oh God.

2790
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:03,760
Oh God.

2791
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:03,820
Oh God.

2792
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:15,300
I can't see where the arm is.

2793
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:21,160
I did best my first attempt.

2794
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:21,980
This sucks.

2795
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:24,840
My first attempt.

2796
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:26,580
Why is my first attempt the best one?

2797
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:27,840
That I've done so far.

2798
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,140
So unfair.

2799
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:33,900
Where are you?

2800
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:34,780
Where are you?

2801
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:35,220
I can't...

2802
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:36,480
My camera angle.

2803
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,940
Most boring match show I've ever seen.

2804
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:39,180
Okay.

2805
02:20:03,910 --> 02:20:04,850
Oh shoot.

2806
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:08,770
Ah!

2807
02:20:09,130 --> 02:20:09,750
Wait, move.

2808
02:20:10,090 --> 02:20:10,530
There we go.

2809
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:14,550
No!

2810
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:22,670
Please move!

2811
02:20:38,970 --> 02:20:39,330
Oh!

2812
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:58,160
Do you want advice?

2813
02:20:58,320 --> 02:20:58,460
Nope.

2814
02:20:59,200 --> 02:20:59,820
I do not.

2815
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:02,880
I already know what I need to do.

2816
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:05,080
It's just a matter of me doing it.

2817
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:13,600
Like I get what I need to do.

2818
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:18,360
It's just, you know, as long as I don't get stunlocked or...

2819
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:20,120
Or...

2820
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:22,580
You know, properly can...

2821
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:25,820
If I can find the arm that he throws me...

2822
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:27,340
Oh wait, I have ragtime already.

2823
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:28,440
So...

2824
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:28,780
Okay.

2825
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:29,960
Alright.

2826
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:45,080
Get his butt.

2827
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:11,630
I got a lock in.

2828
02:22:12,090 --> 02:22:13,390
I got a lock in.

2829
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:15,130
I got a lock in.

2830
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:20,180
Wait, what do you mean you're right there?

2831
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:27,600
I know where you are.

2832
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:30,140
Actually the camera doesn't really give me a choice.

2833
02:22:44,090 --> 02:22:47,050
I run, I run, I run, I run, I run...

2834
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:21,890
Ah, shoot!

2835
02:23:22,750 --> 02:23:22,870
No!

2836
02:23:23,070 --> 02:23:23,510
No, please!

2837
02:23:23,810 --> 02:23:24,590
Oh, cutscene!

2838
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:24,910
Why?

2839
02:23:25,990 --> 02:23:26,790
Oh my god.

2840
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:30,990
Oh my god.

2841
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:31,350
Oh my god.

2842
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:32,030
Thank you.

2843
02:23:32,310 --> 02:23:32,790
Actually...

2844
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:33,290
Oh my god.

2845
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:33,770
Wait.

2846
02:23:34,150 --> 02:23:35,510
You almost got me killed.

2847
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:42,490
Ragtime.

2848
02:23:43,290 --> 02:23:44,710
Is he about to go...

2849
02:23:44,710 --> 02:23:45,190
Psycho mode?

2850
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:46,670
Can't tell.

2851
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:55,260
I did no damage or I...

2852
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:56,680
I got no...

2853
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:59,140
Damage on me for quite some time though.

2854
02:23:59,220 --> 02:23:59,940
So that's not bad.

2855
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:08,020
Oh shit.

2856
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:08,320
Oh shit.

2857
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:08,600
Oh shit.

2858
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:09,120
Oh shit.

2859
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:09,160
Oh god.

2860
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:09,440
Oh god.

2861
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:11,160
Wait.

2862
02:24:11,320 --> 02:24:11,680
Oh shoot.

2863
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:11,940
Shoot.

2864
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:14,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2865
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:15,040
No, no, no.

2866
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:16,280
Please!

2867
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:16,820
Charge.

2868
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:17,060
Charge.

2869
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,000
He turned!

2870
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:39,320
Exactly!

2871
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:40,800
Are you kidding me?

2872
02:24:43,220 --> 02:24:43,940
That's so...

2873
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:44,380
Wow!

2874
02:24:48,820 --> 02:24:51,580
Why did he... why did he turn and look exactly heavy?

2875
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,140
I was just trying to dodge him!

2876
02:24:59,810 --> 02:25:00,470
Oh, shoot.

2877
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:07,330
How did he know where I was?

2878
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:17,290
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2879
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,310
Oh,

2880
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:48,520
come on.

2881
02:25:55,930 --> 02:25:57,650
I was like, why is it so blurry?

2882
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:58,890
It's because I'm almost dead.

2883
02:26:02,990 --> 02:26:04,770
Guys, I might use a gorb on this.

2884
02:26:04,910 --> 02:26:05,470
I'm not gonna lie.

2885
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:08,290
I might use a gorb.

2886
02:26:09,390 --> 02:26:10,150
We'll see.

2887
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:22,670
I have 18 gorbs.

2888
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:24,730
It's fine.

2889
02:26:24,830 --> 02:26:25,490
This guy sucks.

2890
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:25,910
Okay.

2891
02:26:29,090 --> 02:26:29,630
Yippee!

2892
02:26:29,970 --> 02:26:30,890
Round two!

2893
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:33,950
I hate that.

2894
02:26:37,230 --> 02:26:38,190
What's going

2895
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:43,930
on?

2896
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:44,790
Where'd he go?

2897
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:46,310
Oh, I don't like that.

2898
02:26:49,830 --> 02:26:51,230
Oh, I don't like this.

2899
02:26:51,230 --> 02:26:51,610
Wait.

2900
02:26:52,210 --> 02:26:53,050
What are you doing?

2901
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:54,610
I don't want to give up the ghost, do you?

2902
02:27:17,190 --> 02:27:18,210
Okay, that's gonna do.

2903
02:27:18,210 --> 02:27:18,230
Okay, that's gonna do.

2904
02:27:32,390 --> 02:27:34,610
Oh, my God.

2905
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:37,970
Oh, my God!

2906
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:38,810
He's charging!

2907
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:40,890
I feel

2908
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:48,240
like he's not close even to being dead.

2909
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:53,000
Oh, you jerk.

2910
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:55,860
Oh my god, you jerk.

2911
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:58,700
Landed right on me.

2912
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:05,140
Sorry, sorry.

2913
02:28:16,390 --> 02:28:17,630
I'm getting frustrated.

2914
02:28:19,130 --> 02:28:20,450
I'm getting frustrated.

2915
02:28:32,470 --> 02:28:33,990
Okay, that did good damage.

2916
02:28:58,310 --> 02:29:00,590
I tried dodging underneath him.

2917
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:03,050
I tried dodging underneath him.

2918
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:03,550
Fuck this.

2919
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:04,890
I'm using another Gorb.

2920
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:05,670
I don't care.

2921
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:06,810
Gun her?

2922
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:08,310
Oh, I guess that works too, huh?

2923
02:29:12,370 --> 02:29:12,950
Come here.

2924
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:13,410
Come here.

2925
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:14,030
Come here.

2926
02:29:14,130 --> 02:29:14,610
I don't care.

2927
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:15,290
I don't care.

2928
02:29:15,590 --> 02:29:16,310
You're too close.

2929
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:36,470
Because of the Gorb, baby.

2930
02:29:38,090 --> 02:29:40,130
Because I collected Gorbs.

2931
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:45,510
You can come out now.

2932
02:29:58,290 --> 02:29:59,870
I guess I owe you one.

2933
02:30:06,810 --> 02:30:08,030
You should turn around.

2934
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:10,250
Your body's not gonna last much longer.

2935
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:13,730
That...

2936
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:15,130
I cannot do.

2937
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:16,730
I must go.

2938
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:18,070
Goddammit, Bea.

2939
02:30:19,850 --> 02:30:21,110
Don't push yourself.

2940
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:22,490
You need some rest.

2941
02:30:22,670 --> 02:30:23,290
I must go.

2942
02:30:23,470 --> 02:30:24,830
I don't think rest is gonna...

2943
02:30:24,830 --> 02:30:26,250
...solve this.

2944
02:30:27,970 --> 02:30:28,490
Why?

2945
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:28,910
Why?

2946
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:29,130
Why the hell?

2947
02:30:29,350 --> 02:30:29,750
I beg you.

2948
02:30:31,270 --> 02:30:32,870
This is my last request.

2949
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:37,630
Fine.

2950
02:30:40,630 --> 02:30:42,210
Just carry him on his back.

2951
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:43,890
It's on your back.

2952
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:45,430
Dante's definitely gonna beat us there.

2953
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:49,290
Good.

2954
02:30:49,510 --> 02:30:50,750
Let Dante handle it.

2955
02:31:02,380 --> 02:31:04,240
My cursor went right in the middle.

2956
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:18,850
He could use some moisturizer, yeah.

2957
02:31:28,690 --> 02:31:31,050
I don't want... I don't want to play as Nero anymore.

2958
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:37,060
Oh, I don't want to play as Nero anymore.

2959
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:41,100
There's so much to keep up with with that guy.

2960
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,260
He's got the different arms.

2961
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:44,220
He's got the rev.

2962
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:46,240
He's got too much stuff.

2963
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:48,200
I don't want to be him anymore.

2964
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:51,240
Nero, I used to like you so much, but not anymore.

2965
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:03,900
Okay, let's customize.

2966
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:09,820
Alrighty.

2967
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:17,660
I like how Gorb is sold out.

2968
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:18,980
Like I even never bought any.

2969
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:21,840
I never even bought one.

2970
02:32:28,390 --> 02:32:29,110
Let's see.

2971
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:37,130
What was I saving up for?

2972
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:37,690
I can't remember.

2973
02:32:39,790 --> 02:32:41,330
Sad, dead weight noises.

2974
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:42,870
Yeah.

2975
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:45,290
He's living up to his name.

2976
02:32:46,430 --> 02:32:47,530
Oh, the Luce.

2977
02:32:48,010 --> 02:32:48,750
That's right.

2978
02:32:53,450 --> 02:32:54,310
You know what?

2979
02:32:54,350 --> 02:32:57,590
I can buy it and I still have over a hundred thousand.

2980
02:32:58,830 --> 02:33:00,110
Wait, I already learned it.

2981
02:33:00,390 --> 02:33:00,470
Wait.

2982
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:01,030
Oh, sorry.

2983
02:33:01,370 --> 02:33:01,590
Yes.

2984
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,350
Learn it.

2985
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:05,670
Okay, we got that.

2986
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:08,010
Hooey.

2987
02:33:13,470 --> 02:33:15,310
This one was just hold RT.

2988
02:33:15,550 --> 02:33:16,570
This one's hold LT.

2989
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:17,810
Alright.

2990
02:33:21,610 --> 02:33:23,670
I'm just looking at what else there is.

2991
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:40,840
Oh, yeah.

2992
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:41,940
This one I didn't understand.

2993
02:33:43,100 --> 02:33:45,280
Oh, yeah.

2994
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:47,900
Hold on.

2995
02:33:48,620 --> 02:33:50,280
Let me exit here.

2996
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:53,800
Oh, wait.

2997
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:55,680
Can I not get to the skills menu?

2998
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:56,820
In...

2999
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:58,260
In this...

3000
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:58,640
menu?

3001
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:02,200
Like...

3002
02:34:02,610 --> 02:34:04,340
To see what skills I already have?

3003
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:06,980
Oh, in the void I have to.

3004
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:07,600
Okay, okay.

3005
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:11,280
I have that one.

3006
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:13,660
Ignition 3.

3007
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:17,100
We could learn Ignition 3.

3008
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:22,780
You got this minky doing good.

3009
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:23,500
Thank you!

3010
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:26,500
Let's see.

3011
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:28,160
Skills list.

3012
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:30,220
What was it again?

3013
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:33,960
I learned...

3014
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:34,400
What was it?

3015
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:36,280
It was R...

3016
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:36,720
No.

3017
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:39,960
What was it?

3018
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:41,440
Oh, heavy jolt.

3019
02:34:43,460 --> 02:34:44,400
On the ground.

3020
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:45,580
Press R, V.

3021
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:46,640
Forward, Y.

3022
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:47,140
Okay.

3023
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:48,040
Yeah, yeah.

3024
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:54,790
But...

3025
02:34:54,790 --> 02:34:54,930
Wait.

3026
02:34:55,650 --> 02:34:56,890
There was something else I learned.

3027
02:34:57,050 --> 02:34:57,130
No.

3028
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:07,560
I can't remember.

3029
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:11,020
Hmm.

3030
02:35:12,020 --> 02:35:12,540
Hmm.

3031
02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:19,390
Oh!

3032
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:20,470
Okay, okay.

3033
02:35:20,930 --> 02:35:21,250
Yeah, yeah.

3034
02:35:22,130 --> 02:35:22,650
Well...

3035
02:35:24,510 --> 02:35:24,990
Luce.

3036
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:25,970
I already know Luce.

3037
02:35:26,130 --> 02:35:27,070
You just hold down RT.

3038
02:35:27,930 --> 02:35:28,710
That one's easy.

3039
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:31,150
That one's easy.

3040
02:35:31,370 --> 02:35:32,210
We did that one earlier.

3041
02:35:34,110 --> 02:35:34,850
This one.

3042
02:35:35,370 --> 02:35:36,230
Yeah, you just...

3043
02:35:36,230 --> 02:35:37,630
Hold RT.

3044
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,990
Before today?

3045
02:35:42,150 --> 02:35:43,010
No, it was today.

3046
02:35:43,910 --> 02:35:44,570
It's okay.

3047
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:47,190
I think I remember it.

3048
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:49,730
I think I'm okay.

3049
02:35:49,910 --> 02:35:51,870
It was something that I learned from...

3050
02:35:53,470 --> 02:35:57,510
Sword Master 4 or 3 or whatever, whatever.

3051
02:35:59,570 --> 02:36:00,570
And then, yeah.

3052
02:36:00,670 --> 02:36:01,450
I remember ult.

3053
02:36:01,850 --> 02:36:05,210
How to ult was Y and X at the same time.

3054
02:36:06,290 --> 02:36:07,170
Real impact?

3055
02:36:07,430 --> 02:36:07,910
Was that it?

3056
02:36:08,050 --> 02:36:08,250
Maybe.

3057
02:36:10,050 --> 02:36:11,090
Oh, one on one.

3058
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:12,390
Real impact.

3059
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:19,060
I did not see.

3060
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:21,540
Is it in here?

3061
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:28,550
Is it in here?

3062
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:35,020
Sword Master tab.

3063
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:35,600
Oh!

3064
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:37,280
Oh!

3065
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:39,680
That's why I was like...

3066
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,340
I can't find any of the stuff that I learned.

3067
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:43,960
Because it's all under here.

3068
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:45,320
Oh my goodness gracious.

3069
02:36:46,820 --> 02:36:47,060
Okay.

3070
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:49,540
Wheelie jump.

3071
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:50,520
Press RB.

3072
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:51,580
Back B.

3073
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:52,260
Okay, okay.

3074
02:36:54,260 --> 02:36:54,740
RB.

3075
02:36:54,980 --> 02:36:55,580
Forward B.

3076
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:56,480
Yeah, we knew that.

3077
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:58,380
Mid air.

3078
02:36:58,640 --> 02:36:59,440
Press B, B, B.

3079
02:37:05,540 --> 02:37:06,380
Kick mode.

3080
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:06,820
Mid air.

3081
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:07,060
B.

3082
02:37:07,540 --> 02:37:08,020
Firestorm.

3083
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:09,460
Kick mode.

3084
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:09,780
B.

3085
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:11,820
Blow mode.

3086
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:14,160
Back.

3087
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:15,340
B.

3088
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:16,780
Okay, that's the one I was thinking of.

3089
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:17,920
Okay, so I'm good.

3090
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:18,620
Okay, alright.

3091
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:20,120
Alright.

3092
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:22,600
Oh, that stopped.

3093
02:37:25,060 --> 02:37:27,400
I pressed back menu too many times.

3094
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:30,960
Okay, let's just carry on then.

3095
02:37:32,530 --> 02:37:33,540
Let's carry on.

3096
02:37:35,620 --> 02:37:36,160
Okay.

3097
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:38,320
I think we can...

3098
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:39,080
I think we'll be okay.

3099
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:39,600
Wait.

3100
02:37:39,900 --> 02:37:41,340
Did I buy everything I wanted to buy?

3101
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:43,720
I still have 100,000.

3102
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:46,040
Let's buy...

3103
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:05,380
Ignition three or orb?

3104
02:38:05,540 --> 02:38:06,000
What's igni...

3105
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:06,880
Where's ignition three?

3106
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:07,480
Is that under here?

3107
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:10,080
No.

3108
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:11,660
Wait, what's ignition three?

3109
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:14,480
What was that one?

3110
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:18,160
Under Balrog.

3111
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:20,140
Did I miss it?

3112
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:21,360
Oh!

3113
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:22,300
Duh, duh.

3114
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:23,080
Stupid.

3115
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:24,000
Yes.

3116
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:29,100
I feel I use this one enough that it is worth having ignition.

3117
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:29,860
But hold on.

3118
02:38:30,700 --> 02:38:31,740
Uh, sorry.

3119
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:33,280
My brain is...

3120
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:35,720
Jello after that last fight.

3121
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:37,760
Ugh.

3122
02:38:38,180 --> 02:38:40,280
My brain is jello after that last fight.

3123
02:38:59,590 --> 02:39:00,450
I'll do it.

3124
02:39:01,570 --> 02:39:03,350
Cause I can still buy...

3125
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:06,110
A Blorb or a Porb.

3126
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:08,230
Hmm.

3127
02:39:12,510 --> 02:39:13,850
You use it enough to be worth it.

3128
02:39:13,850 --> 02:39:14,650
That's how I feel too.

3129
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:31,240
I wish I could see how many...

3130
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:33,400
Fragments I had...

3131
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:35,040
At the moment.

3132
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,640
Usually it has it up in the corner.

3133
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:44,900
Spend it all.

3134
02:39:49,220 --> 02:39:50,820
What I think I'll do...

3135
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:53,700
Is I think I'll get...

3136
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:55,680
A Blorb.

3137
02:39:58,040 --> 02:39:59,380
I'll get a Blorb.

3138
02:39:59,700 --> 02:40:01,060
Then we'll save up.

3139
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:02,520
I can get a Porb.

3140
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:05,820
And then I also wanna learn...

3141
02:40:06,380 --> 02:40:07,180
Next time.

3142
02:40:10,720 --> 02:40:11,200
Demolition.

3143
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:14,860
So we'll do...

3144
02:40:14,860 --> 02:40:16,760
We'll go with those two maybe next time.

3145
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:18,380
Porb and Demolition.

3146
02:40:20,180 --> 02:40:21,580
No more Blorbs for sale!

3147
02:40:21,740 --> 02:40:22,440
It didn't say that!

3148
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:24,180
Wait, did it say it sold out?

3149
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:26,520
For good?

3150
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:29,960
Oh my god, it sold out for good!

3151
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:30,660
You're right!

3152
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:32,020
Stock zero.

3153
02:40:32,780 --> 02:40:33,220
Oh shoot.

3154
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:34,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3155
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:38,680
Ruh roh.

3156
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:41,700
Oh, I have two out of four...

3157
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:43,000
And one out of four for the Borb.

3158
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:43,220
Okay.

3159
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:45,500
Let's go!

3160
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:46,240
Mission sixteen!

3161
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:50,140
All Blorbed out.

3162
02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:51,720
We gotta go find some now.

3163
02:40:52,940 --> 02:40:54,600
Oh my gosh, I'm back...

3164
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:55,700
I'm back here!

3165
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:57,660
In the holes!

3166
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:01,200
Wait, is there nothing around here?

3167
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:08,950
Nothing around here?

3168
02:41:18,530 --> 02:41:19,870
Just a hole!

3169
02:41:20,470 --> 02:41:20,810
Whee!

3170
02:41:21,550 --> 02:41:22,130
Alright.

3171
02:41:22,510 --> 02:41:23,830
This is the real deal.

3172
02:41:24,590 --> 02:41:25,290
It is?

3173
02:41:25,430 --> 02:41:27,250
Hasn't been the real deal since now?

3174
02:41:29,770 --> 02:41:31,130
What have I been...

3175
02:41:31,130 --> 02:41:32,170
Full speed ahead.

3176
02:41:32,370 --> 02:41:33,790
Has this been a joke to you, Dante?

3177
02:41:34,250 --> 02:41:34,930
Until now?

3178
02:41:35,630 --> 02:41:36,850
Full speed ahead.

3179
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:37,770
Yeah.

3180
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:39,370
Full speed ahead.

3181
02:41:40,730 --> 02:41:41,530
So true.

3182
02:41:43,550 --> 02:41:46,170
I guess everything's kind of a joke to this guy, huh?

3183
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:46,830
Oh!

3184
02:41:47,090 --> 02:41:48,430
Oh, I missed some...

3185
02:41:50,250 --> 02:41:50,750
Some...

3186
02:41:50,750 --> 02:41:51,670
Warbs.

3187
02:41:53,830 --> 02:41:54,470
Oh!

3188
02:41:54,650 --> 02:41:55,010
Nice.

3189
02:41:56,190 --> 02:41:57,610
Collecting on the way down.

3190
02:41:59,130 --> 02:42:00,830
We're going down, down!

3191
02:42:01,390 --> 02:42:03,010
Lee-boo-ba-ba-dee-bow!

3192
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:09,940
You sure I didn't miss any?

3193
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:11,900
No?

3194
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:13,200
I think we're good.

3195
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:15,100
Okay.

3196
02:42:17,540 --> 02:42:19,780
Baby, we're going down, spinning.

3197
02:42:23,690 --> 02:42:26,170
A hundred, blah, a million.

3198
02:42:28,130 --> 02:42:29,810
A number one.

3199
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:34,290
Devil, trigger, cock it and pull it.

3200
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:39,720
Where's the guys?

3201
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:42,060
Am I not getting ambushed here?

3202
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:43,440
Shocking.

3203
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:45,980
Oh.

3204
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:55,830
Oh, shoot.

3205
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:56,350
Oh, sissy.

3206
02:42:56,530 --> 02:42:57,010
These guys.

3207
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:05,080
These guys kind of...

3208
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:11,360
I was trying to avoid that one guy.

3209
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:12,860
I knew he was coming up from behind me.

3210
02:43:28,310 --> 02:43:28,670
Woo!

3211
02:43:28,970 --> 02:43:30,190
Wait, where did you come from?

3212
02:43:37,890 --> 02:43:38,970
I don't like each other.

3213
02:43:39,610 --> 02:43:39,890
Oh my god.

3214
02:43:40,090 --> 02:43:41,390
Dodge, please.

3215
02:44:00,410 --> 02:44:01,250
That was not good.

3216
02:44:03,510 --> 02:44:04,890
Okay, at least we got that guy.

3217
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:15,160
Can I go into kick mode?

3218
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:15,580
Oh, there we go.

3219
02:44:15,820 --> 02:44:16,720
There we go.

3220
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:22,900
Unfortunate.

3221
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:38,260
And we're stylin' and we're stylin' and we're stylin' and we're stylin' and we're stylin' and we're stylin' and we're stylin'.

3222
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:39,100
Come on.

3223
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:39,780
There we go.

3224
02:44:45,990 --> 02:44:51,590
And we're styling, and we're styling, and we're styling, and I'm running away and I'm running away...

3225
02:45:05,710 --> 02:45:06,150
Stylin'.

3226
02:45:07,370 --> 02:45:07,810
Yeah.

3227
02:45:11,470 --> 02:45:14,690
And I'm styling, and I'm styling, and I'm styling!

3228
02:45:15,090 --> 02:45:15,510
Woo!

3229
02:45:16,450 --> 02:45:20,130
And I'm parrying, and I'm parrying, and I'm parrying, and I'm...

3230
02:45:20,130 --> 02:45:21,690
Where do you think you're going?

3231
02:45:22,510 --> 02:45:23,510
Right here!

3232
02:45:24,890 --> 02:45:26,990
Oh, and I'm missing, and I'm missing.

3233
02:45:34,670 --> 02:45:36,190
I'm just being goofy now.

3234
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:54,080
Oh yeah, I should've put the hat on him, huh?

3235
02:45:54,660 --> 02:45:56,120
Don't forget about the hat.

3236
02:45:56,420 --> 02:45:58,340
Does the hat make them drop more warbs?

3237
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:59,080
Is that what it does?

3238
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:01,000
Like, what's the point of the hat?

3239
02:46:05,450 --> 02:46:06,670
It dies, actually.

3240
02:46:06,890 --> 02:46:07,010
Okay.

3241
02:46:07,010 --> 02:46:10,510
Three, two, one, zero.

3242
02:46:23,870 --> 02:46:25,530
Oh, oh, oh.

3243
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:26,490
Oh, no!

3244
02:46:27,190 --> 02:46:27,590
No!

3245
02:46:28,330 --> 02:46:28,990
Wait, wait!

3246
02:46:29,270 --> 02:46:30,310
I went too far!

3247
02:46:31,410 --> 02:46:33,390
I... I... Oh!

3248
02:46:33,790 --> 02:46:34,290
No!

3249
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:36,730
I missed everything!

3250
02:46:38,890 --> 02:46:40,570
Wee, wee, wee!

3251
02:46:40,810 --> 02:46:41,770
Put my Mito trigger!

3252
02:46:46,890 --> 02:46:48,010
Have SDT ready?

3253
02:46:48,250 --> 02:46:49,630
Wait, you can't just have it ready.

3254
02:46:49,810 --> 02:46:50,810
You have to, like, charge it.

3255
02:46:51,410 --> 02:46:53,110
And then, when you release...

3256
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:56,030
I wish you could just have it at the ready, and then be like, BAM!

3257
02:46:56,370 --> 02:46:56,650
You know?

3258
02:46:57,670 --> 02:46:59,070
Wah, wah, wah!

3259
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:05,840
Oh, bats!

3260
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:08,060
I freaking hate bats.

3261
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:13,220
Oh my golly!

3262
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:15,060
I'm just trying to...

3263
02:47:15,060 --> 02:47:16,100
I'm just trying to live here.

3264
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:17,540
Oh, ouch.

3265
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:17,980
Okay.

3266
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:21,780
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

3267
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:22,360
Maybe...

3268
02:47:22,360 --> 02:47:22,660
Hold on.

3269
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:23,620
Let's, uh...

3270
02:47:23,620 --> 02:47:25,180
Let's reconsider.

3271
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:26,160
Okay.

3272
02:47:27,180 --> 02:47:28,420
How do I want to do this?

3273
02:47:48,250 --> 02:47:50,350
You can charge your SDT without activating?

3274
02:47:50,490 --> 02:47:50,750
I can?

3275
02:47:51,910 --> 02:47:53,550
But I thought I needed to...

3276
02:47:56,130 --> 02:47:57,060
I thought...

3277
02:47:58,730 --> 02:47:59,970
I thought...

3278
02:47:59,970 --> 02:48:00,470
What?

3279
02:48:04,590 --> 02:48:05,590
Just like that?

3280
02:48:06,030 --> 02:48:07,310
And then I hold off?

3281
02:48:19,220 --> 02:48:19,840
Oh.

3282
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:20,940
Get near the hat.

3283
02:48:24,530 --> 02:48:25,770
I can't see it.

3284
02:48:26,390 --> 02:48:26,450
Oh.

3285
02:48:26,690 --> 02:48:27,450
There we go.

3286
02:48:27,970 --> 02:48:29,290
Wait, I think I give it to...

3287
02:48:29,290 --> 02:48:29,570
Woo!

3288
02:48:30,740 --> 02:48:31,390
The countdown!

3289
02:48:31,950 --> 02:48:32,670
The countdown!

3290
02:48:32,930 --> 02:48:33,290
Woo!

3291
02:48:36,190 --> 02:48:36,810
Woo!

3292
02:48:39,790 --> 02:48:41,070
I'm trying to get behind you, buddy.

3293
02:48:54,090 --> 02:48:55,650
Wait, I didn't give him the hat.

3294
02:48:56,170 --> 02:48:57,610
But I thought I threw it.

3295
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:58,550
I tried.

3296
02:49:00,030 --> 02:49:00,490
Do I...

3297
02:49:00,490 --> 02:49:01,550
I did forward gun.

3298
02:49:01,710 --> 02:49:02,810
Maybe I have to lock on.

3299
02:49:03,370 --> 02:49:04,310
Is it RB?

3300
02:49:04,570 --> 02:49:04,890
Hold on.

3301
02:49:04,990 --> 02:49:05,270
Let's...

3302
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:06,050
We'll attempt...

3303
02:49:06,050 --> 02:49:07,190
We'll test it next time.

3304
02:49:07,850 --> 02:49:07,990
Oh.

3305
02:49:08,470 --> 02:49:09,650
Oh, oh, oh.

3306
02:49:09,950 --> 02:49:10,410
Okay.

3307
02:49:12,090 --> 02:49:12,730
Let's see.

3308
02:49:13,390 --> 02:49:13,910
Oh.

3309
02:49:22,330 --> 02:49:23,450
It's a lock on.

3310
02:49:23,630 --> 02:49:24,410
Okay, okay, okay.

3311
02:49:25,110 --> 02:49:26,110
That's what we...

3312
02:49:26,110 --> 02:49:27,170
That's what I did wrong.

3313
02:49:28,030 --> 02:49:29,030
My bad.

3314
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:31,090
My bad.

3315
02:49:33,850 --> 02:49:35,310
We'll get her next time, boys.

3316
02:49:35,570 --> 02:49:37,010
All my raw herbs that I could've gotten.

3317
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:42,460
Missed.

3318
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:43,280
Missed.

3319
02:49:43,420 --> 02:49:43,780
Missed.

3320
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:45,940
Missed business opportunity.

3321
02:49:45,940 --> 02:49:46,220
Missed machine.

3322
02:49:53,650 --> 02:49:54,010
Uh...

3323
02:49:54,010 --> 02:49:54,850
I can't see anything.

3324
02:49:59,910 --> 02:50:01,030
Oh, where did you come from?

3325
02:50:02,310 --> 02:50:02,870
Oh, wait.

3326
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:04,110
Uh...

3327
02:50:04,110 --> 02:50:04,710
You get a hat?

3328
02:50:06,210 --> 02:50:07,210
Wait, did it give it to you?

3329
02:50:08,190 --> 02:50:08,550
No.

3330
02:50:08,890 --> 02:50:09,330
Come here.

3331
02:50:09,770 --> 02:50:10,350
Wait, come here.

3332
02:50:11,290 --> 02:50:12,350
Where are you going?

3333
02:50:12,350 --> 02:50:12,450
Where are you going?

3334
02:50:15,870 --> 02:50:16,430
Uh...

3335
02:50:16,430 --> 02:50:17,950
My business venture...

3336
02:50:17,950 --> 02:50:19,270
Did not work out.

3337
02:50:21,750 --> 02:50:23,230
It did do the hat.

3338
02:50:23,570 --> 02:50:25,470
For once it did it.

3339
02:50:25,630 --> 02:50:25,750
Oh.

3340
02:50:26,330 --> 02:50:27,750
My business venture.

3341
02:50:29,210 --> 02:50:29,770
Oh.

3342
02:50:29,970 --> 02:50:31,510
I think he went down the hole, you guys.

3343
02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:33,770
I think he's a lost cause.

3344
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:35,350
My...

3345
02:50:35,350 --> 02:50:35,890
My...

3346
02:50:35,890 --> 02:50:37,090
My business is a...

3347
02:50:37,090 --> 02:50:38,030
Is a sinking pit.

3348
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:44,200
You get a hat.

3349
02:50:44,660 --> 02:50:44,880
Wait.

3350
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:45,800
You get a hat.

3351
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:47,260
Oh, there it is.

3352
02:50:49,960 --> 02:50:51,160
And you get a hat.

3353
02:50:52,880 --> 02:50:53,800
You get a hat.

3354
02:50:54,440 --> 02:50:55,260
There it is.

3355
02:51:07,280 --> 02:51:09,720
I wanna do just one of these guys at a time.

3356
02:51:12,190 --> 02:51:14,390
I'll get trapped by both of their mouths.

3357
02:51:14,770 --> 02:51:15,370
Holy!

3358
02:51:33,230 --> 02:51:34,190
Just keep going.

3359
02:51:34,470 --> 02:51:35,410
Just keep going.

3360
02:51:35,670 --> 02:51:36,490
Just keep going.

3361
02:51:36,890 --> 02:51:37,750
Just keep going.

3362
02:52:08,670 --> 02:52:09,270
I'm styling.

3363
02:52:09,470 --> 02:52:09,810
I'm styling.

3364
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:10,990
I'm styling.

3365
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:14,810
Oh shoot.

3366
02:52:15,290 --> 02:52:15,590
Oh shoot.

3367
02:52:32,690 --> 02:52:33,870
Oh no, Dante.

3368
02:52:34,490 --> 02:52:36,870
You didn't look so cool in that finisher, buddy.

3369
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:39,050
Oh, Dante.

3370
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:41,110
Dante, your finisher.

3371
02:52:46,550 --> 02:52:47,610
Perfect, yeah.

3372
02:52:51,510 --> 02:52:52,070
Okay.

3373
02:52:53,170 --> 02:52:55,510
I'm gonna not mess up this one.

3374
02:53:05,890 --> 02:53:07,330
Okay, actually, I need those.

3375
02:53:07,730 --> 02:53:08,870
Okay, we can go from there.

3376
02:53:12,470 --> 02:53:13,590
To the tree.

3377
02:53:15,370 --> 02:53:15,770
Yeah.

3378
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:16,830
Very good.

3379
02:53:32,810 --> 02:53:34,470
I wish I could give the tree a hat.

3380
02:53:40,350 --> 02:53:41,490
Okay, it's gonna break through.

3381
02:53:42,650 --> 02:53:43,850
And we're gonna go to this one.

3382
02:53:44,390 --> 02:53:45,550
We're gonna go to this one.

3383
02:53:45,750 --> 02:53:47,690
Wow, they're giving me so much...

3384
02:53:47,690 --> 02:53:48,850
So many orbs.

3385
02:53:49,170 --> 02:53:50,790
I should just DT in every battle.

3386
02:53:52,770 --> 02:53:55,050
I should just be DT-ing all the time.

3387
02:53:55,930 --> 02:53:57,330
I'm nervous now.

3388
02:53:57,510 --> 02:53:58,030
It feels different.

3389
02:53:58,390 --> 02:53:58,810
It feels...

3390
02:53:58,810 --> 02:53:59,790
Things have changed.

3391
02:54:00,570 --> 02:54:02,470
Things have changed with the DT.

3392
02:54:02,930 --> 02:54:06,290
I'm an ultra, mega, big, big guy DT.

3393
02:54:06,610 --> 02:54:07,790
Yes, you should.

3394
02:54:08,110 --> 02:54:09,050
Okay, okay.

3395
02:54:09,910 --> 02:54:13,610
I just like to save it for in case I need it to bust out.

3396
02:54:14,930 --> 02:54:15,530
Gosh.

3397
02:54:17,390 --> 02:54:20,450
I like to hoard it in case I get trapped.

3398
02:54:23,890 --> 02:54:25,370
DT has changed.

3399
02:54:25,890 --> 02:54:25,970
Oh.

3400
02:54:26,670 --> 02:54:27,670
I'm somewhere.

3401
02:54:27,930 --> 02:54:29,010
In this game.

3402
02:54:30,450 --> 02:54:30,770
Oh.

3403
02:54:37,290 --> 02:54:37,850
Oh.

3404
02:54:38,550 --> 02:54:39,790
I messed that up.

3405
02:54:39,930 --> 02:54:40,890
I messed that up.

3406
02:54:41,270 --> 02:54:42,510
I messed that up.

3407
02:54:44,070 --> 02:54:44,630
Oh.

3408
02:54:45,430 --> 02:54:46,470
Is this...

3409
02:54:46,470 --> 02:54:47,870
Oh, is this...

3410
02:54:47,870 --> 02:54:48,330
Oh.

3411
02:54:49,230 --> 02:54:50,790
Okay, this is when I had...

3412
02:54:50,790 --> 02:54:51,150
What's it called?

3413
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:51,610
Oh my gosh.

3414
02:54:51,850 --> 02:54:53,970
This is when I had...

3415
02:54:58,030 --> 02:54:59,590
I had a tomboy.

3416
02:55:00,730 --> 02:55:02,430
I was kicking his butt.

3417
02:55:02,730 --> 02:55:03,490
Like crazy.

3418
02:55:07,110 --> 02:55:09,130
I was going sicko mode.

3419
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:21,400
Yeah!

3420
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:24,360
Oh, I forgot to give him a hat.

3421
02:55:48,830 --> 02:55:49,510
I can't see!

3422
02:55:53,110 --> 02:55:56,050
So, I look cool in both sides now.

3423
02:55:59,630 --> 02:56:01,710
I look cool in both sides.

3424
02:56:01,850 --> 02:56:02,850
Wait, so...

3425
02:56:04,650 --> 02:56:05,390
I'm ca...

3426
02:56:05,390 --> 02:56:06,930
Wait, is it still rev?

3427
02:56:07,170 --> 02:56:07,970
Like the...

3428
02:56:07,970 --> 02:56:09,310
My SDT?

3429
02:56:09,490 --> 02:56:10,470
Is it still charged?

3430
02:56:14,750 --> 02:56:15,710
It is?

3431
02:56:15,950 --> 02:56:17,330
I can't tell the difference.

3432
02:56:18,730 --> 02:56:20,010
Maybe because it's...

3433
02:56:20,010 --> 02:56:21,770
Because it's been like this color.

3434
02:56:22,450 --> 02:56:22,550
Oh.

3435
02:56:22,750 --> 02:56:22,850
Oh.

3436
02:56:23,050 --> 02:56:23,130
Oh.

3437
02:56:23,710 --> 02:56:24,410
What's this?

3438
02:56:26,090 --> 02:56:26,610
Nothing.

3439
02:56:27,690 --> 02:56:28,710
Whole light or nothing.

3440
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:32,710
The red bar is full.

3441
02:56:32,990 --> 02:56:33,270
Oh god.

3442
02:56:36,450 --> 02:56:37,330
Awakari mash.

3443
02:56:38,750 --> 02:56:39,930
Oh, it's these guys.

3444
02:56:40,110 --> 02:56:41,170
I hate these guys.

3445
02:56:41,450 --> 02:56:42,290
I hate these guys.

3446
02:56:43,450 --> 02:56:43,970
Whoop!

3447
02:57:01,090 --> 02:57:02,650
Dang, they do a lot of damage.

3448
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:20,200
There we go.

3449
02:57:33,730 --> 02:57:34,290
What?

3450
02:57:37,930 --> 02:57:39,150
No, I want this guy.

3451
02:57:39,290 --> 02:57:39,450
Oop.

3452
02:57:41,590 --> 02:57:42,430
There we go.

3453
02:57:47,530 --> 02:57:48,650
And I...

3454
02:57:48,650 --> 02:57:49,170
Hold.

3455
02:57:53,310 --> 02:57:55,250
And I start styling on him.

3456
02:57:56,670 --> 02:57:57,530
Wait, come here.

3457
02:57:57,530 --> 02:57:58,290
Come here, come here, come here.

3458
02:57:59,130 --> 02:58:01,250
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3459
02:58:01,370 --> 02:58:02,850
Oh no, see, he grabs me.

3460
02:58:03,070 --> 02:58:04,250
I can't DT out.

3461
02:58:09,610 --> 02:58:10,310
There we go.

3462
02:58:10,650 --> 02:58:11,170
It's okay.

3463
02:58:11,450 --> 02:58:12,810
I don't even need to worry.

3464
02:58:15,110 --> 02:58:15,550
Wait.

3465
02:58:18,450 --> 02:58:18,890
Wait.

3466
02:58:20,190 --> 02:58:20,850
There we go.

3467
02:58:20,850 --> 02:58:20,870
Damn.

3468
02:58:23,870 --> 02:58:24,530
Okay.

3469
02:58:24,530 --> 02:58:25,850
Yeah, just kick his butt inside.

3470
02:58:26,190 --> 02:58:26,330
Exactly.

3471
02:58:27,550 --> 02:58:28,610
Come on.

3472
02:58:29,150 --> 02:58:29,510
Oh.

3473
02:58:31,170 --> 02:58:32,190
Oh my goodness.

3474
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:35,770
Whoa.

3475
02:58:44,320 --> 02:58:46,480
Dante wins by doing nothing.

3476
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:47,120
Wait.

3477
02:58:48,280 --> 02:58:49,380
Look at this guy.

3478
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:50,080
He's so cool.

3479
02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:51,800
Three, two...

3480
02:58:51,800 --> 02:58:52,900
Ha ha ha ha!

3481
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:57,120
Dante wins by doing nothing!

3482
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:01,860
I keep forgetting to give them their hats!

3483
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:05,460
You guys can scream that at me, you can be like, Hat!

3484
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:06,000
Minto!

3485
02:59:06,140 --> 02:59:06,340
Hat!

3486
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:09,960
I'm not always looking at chat, cause you know I'm gaming, but...

3487
02:59:10,860 --> 02:59:12,260
I'll try and at least see that.

3488
02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:15,320
Oh!

3489
02:59:15,320 --> 02:59:16,540
Oh!

3490
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:24,260
Nice.

3491
02:59:24,810 --> 02:59:25,840
I don't wanna miss...

3492
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:28,300
I feel like there's gotta be like a...

3493
02:59:28,300 --> 02:59:29,100
Minto hat!

3494
02:59:29,220 --> 02:59:29,800
Not right now!

3495
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:33,440
Not right now, you guys!

3496
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:35,500
When it's an appropriate time.

3497
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:37,260
I'll try and do it first thing.

3498
02:59:37,960 --> 02:59:38,260
You know?

3499
02:59:42,220 --> 02:59:44,840
First thing, give everybody their party hat.

3500
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:49,160
Second thing, kick their ass.

3501
02:59:50,040 --> 02:59:51,300
That sounds like a shirt.

3502
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:52,840
Oh my god!

3503
02:59:53,140 --> 02:59:54,100
Have you guys seen...

3504
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:56,320
So, Fangamer has one...

3505
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:58,420
Devil May Cry t-shirt.

3506
02:59:58,820 --> 03:00:00,960
One Devil May Cry item in general.

3507
03:00:00,960 --> 03:00:01,820
And it's a t-shirt.

3508
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:03,260
And it's so...

3509
03:00:04,780 --> 03:00:07,300
It's so Devil May Cry, it's great.

3510
03:00:08,240 --> 03:00:09,660
Oh wait, the hat is temporary.

3511
03:00:09,880 --> 03:00:11,060
It has to be done before you kill them?

3512
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:12,940
Oh...

3513
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:13,320
Okay.

3514
03:00:17,290 --> 03:00:17,690
Damn.

3515
03:00:20,890 --> 03:00:24,010
You have to go to the Fangamer site and look at it.

3516
03:00:24,750 --> 03:00:25,550
It's so...

3517
03:00:25,550 --> 03:00:27,070
When you see it, you're like, wow.

3518
03:00:30,610 --> 03:00:31,590
Oh, there's the hole.

3519
03:00:31,790 --> 03:00:31,910
Okay.

3520
03:00:37,990 --> 03:00:39,370
Oh god, I looked it up.

3521
03:00:42,550 --> 03:00:43,490
Isn't it great?

3522
03:00:54,450 --> 03:00:56,030
I think I can get one of these...

3523
03:00:56,030 --> 03:00:57,190
One of the things I wanted to get.

3524
03:00:57,350 --> 03:00:57,990
Oh yeah, demolition.

3525
03:00:58,110 --> 03:00:58,390
There we go.

3526
03:01:00,930 --> 03:01:01,450
What?

3527
03:01:02,670 --> 03:01:03,190
Oh.

3528
03:01:03,410 --> 03:01:05,350
I, for some reason, thought the porb was...

3529
03:01:05,350 --> 03:01:07,110
Less than 40,000.

3530
03:01:07,190 --> 03:01:07,330
Okay.

3531
03:01:10,070 --> 03:01:11,350
It's pure cringe.

3532
03:01:11,490 --> 03:01:12,010
It is!

3533
03:01:12,870 --> 03:01:14,010
It's so perfect.

3534
03:01:14,530 --> 03:01:14,830
No?

3535
03:01:15,130 --> 03:01:16,730
It's like the most perfect...

3536
03:01:17,310 --> 03:01:18,830
Devil May Cry t-shirt I've ever seen.

3537
03:01:24,370 --> 03:01:24,890
No.

3538
03:01:29,850 --> 03:01:31,130
Only kills...

3539
03:01:31,130 --> 03:01:31,170
Only kills...

3540
03:01:31,170 --> 03:01:32,450
Of the underworld...

3541
03:01:32,450 --> 03:01:34,170
May enter these gates.

3542
03:01:34,610 --> 03:01:36,670
He shall not pass!

3543
03:01:38,630 --> 03:01:39,770
Easy there, fella.

3544
03:01:40,390 --> 03:01:43,010
Hey, I remember stinky little pooch just like you.

3545
03:01:43,190 --> 03:01:43,610
Oh yeah.

3546
03:01:44,710 --> 03:01:45,650
Oh yeah!

3547
03:01:45,870 --> 03:01:47,050
You insult me!

3548
03:01:48,110 --> 03:01:49,730
Vow, scented creature!

3549
03:01:49,770 --> 03:01:50,030
Oh!

3550
03:01:53,390 --> 03:01:54,950
Oh yeah, I remember.

3551
03:01:56,530 --> 03:01:58,770
Looks like your master's got you on a pretty short leash.

3552
03:01:59,070 --> 03:02:00,230
Okay, time to try Lucy.

3553
03:02:00,230 --> 03:02:00,590
Come on, little puppy.

3554
03:02:01,090 --> 03:02:01,830
I'll take you out for a walk.

3555
03:02:01,990 --> 03:02:02,870
Come on, let's go.

3556
03:02:04,250 --> 03:02:10,890
You have fought our king with the best, for I am king of the summer's tribe.

3557
03:02:13,110 --> 03:02:14,710
I got that trap for me.

3558
03:02:15,590 --> 03:02:24,390
But we will feast on your flesh and gnaw on your bones.

3559
03:02:26,890 --> 03:02:27,450
Yeah!

3560
03:02:34,510 --> 03:02:37,850
So, you're the strongest in the litter.

3561
03:02:38,450 --> 03:02:40,390
Looks like we're gonna need a bigger leash.

3562
03:02:40,750 --> 03:02:41,110
Come on.

3563
03:02:48,820 --> 03:02:50,020
Ooh, ooh!

3564
03:03:00,710 --> 03:03:01,570
Here I go.

3565
03:03:02,230 --> 03:03:04,590
Wait, was it left trigger or right trigger?

3566
03:03:04,990 --> 03:03:05,810
Oh my gosh.

3567
03:03:09,890 --> 03:03:10,610
Oop, oop, oop.

3568
03:03:11,510 --> 03:03:12,070
Wait.

3569
03:03:13,230 --> 03:03:15,590
Oh, it was the wrong one.

3570
03:03:15,710 --> 03:03:17,150
Wait, it's a left trigger.

3571
03:03:17,290 --> 03:03:17,570
There we go.

3572
03:03:17,790 --> 03:03:18,710
I missed it!

3573
03:03:25,780 --> 03:03:28,360
It was a right trigger, not the left trigger.

3574
03:03:30,660 --> 03:03:31,320
It's okay.

3575
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:34,460
We just...

3576
03:03:34,460 --> 03:03:35,720
We just...

3577
03:03:35,720 --> 03:03:35,920
We...

3578
03:03:35,920 --> 03:03:36,560
We...

3579
03:03:36,560 --> 03:03:37,280
...apply.

3580
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:39,940
Seen these moves before.

3581
03:03:40,680 --> 03:03:42,160
Can I give him a hat?

3582
03:03:42,860 --> 03:03:43,640
Oh my God!

3583
03:03:49,990 --> 03:03:51,330
I gave him a hat!

3584
03:03:51,530 --> 03:03:53,010
He's got three little hats!

3585
03:03:59,590 --> 03:04:01,010
It's so cute.

3586
03:04:02,030 --> 03:04:02,850
Oh, wait.

3587
03:04:29,860 --> 03:04:30,540
Ouch.

3588
03:04:32,040 --> 03:04:33,180
Oh, here we go.

3589
03:04:35,380 --> 03:04:37,040
Okay, it's right.

3590
03:04:38,060 --> 03:04:39,120
Alright, it's right.

3591
03:04:48,010 --> 03:04:49,710
Oh my god.

3592
03:04:58,890 --> 03:05:00,410
Come on, come on, Dante, you got this.

3593
03:05:00,410 --> 03:05:01,870
Come on, just get an hit.

3594
03:05:02,130 --> 03:05:02,310
Okay.

3595
03:05:06,690 --> 03:05:07,450
That hurt me.

3596
03:05:14,550 --> 03:05:18,020
Okay, let them get too close.

3597
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:20,460
Oh my gosh.

3598
03:05:30,140 --> 03:05:30,540
Ah.

3599
03:05:31,540 --> 03:05:32,640
Can I knock these back at him?

3600
03:05:37,670 --> 03:05:38,790
Oh, ouch, ouch.

3601
03:05:54,400 --> 03:05:55,820
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3602
03:05:58,220 --> 03:05:59,220
Oh, okay.

3603
03:06:02,560 --> 03:06:03,040
Okay.

3604
03:06:18,330 --> 03:06:19,210
Let's try again.

3605
03:06:26,830 --> 03:06:27,670
Oh, okay.

3606
03:06:28,770 --> 03:06:30,170
I just messed up the first.

3607
03:06:31,790 --> 03:06:33,210
The first one.

3608
03:06:33,450 --> 03:06:33,870
The first one.

3609
03:06:33,870 --> 03:06:34,170
My bad.

3610
03:06:36,510 --> 03:06:37,610
The ultimate.

3611
03:06:37,930 --> 03:06:38,450
Oh, yeah.

3612
03:06:38,670 --> 03:06:39,870
We could try that too, right?

3613
03:06:40,470 --> 03:06:41,650
That'd be crazy.

3614
03:06:45,490 --> 03:06:46,130
Neat.

3615
03:06:46,670 --> 03:06:48,130
There's some robs around here.

3616
03:06:50,250 --> 03:06:55,250
The ultimate I should do probably right before my DT runs out though, no?

3617
03:06:58,110 --> 03:06:58,890
Towards the end.

3618
03:06:59,010 --> 03:06:59,150
Towards the end.

3619
03:06:59,150 --> 03:06:59,530
Yes, yes, yes.

3620
03:06:59,650 --> 03:06:59,750
Okay.

3621
03:07:06,030 --> 03:07:07,090
Wait, was I charged?

3622
03:07:07,350 --> 03:07:08,170
Oops, I didn't notice.

3623
03:07:11,750 --> 03:07:13,290
He's gonna pose.

3624
03:07:13,470 --> 03:07:14,410
It's gonna be really awesome.

3625
03:07:21,710 --> 03:07:22,350
Yeah.

3626
03:07:22,350 --> 03:07:23,650
Yeah, we...

3627
03:07:29,930 --> 03:07:30,810
I'm gonna...

3628
03:07:30,810 --> 03:07:31,950
Ooh, take some.

3629
03:07:38,190 --> 03:07:40,170
You're a bit tougher than the rest of your breeding.

3630
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:51,340
Perfectly executed.

3631
03:07:52,300 --> 03:07:52,540
Yeah!

3632
03:08:00,800 --> 03:08:01,440
Woo!

3633
03:08:05,510 --> 03:08:06,710
Nice suit.

3634
03:08:07,670 --> 03:08:08,750
Oh, come on.

3635
03:08:09,010 --> 03:08:09,710
Even in the air?

3636
03:08:10,110 --> 03:08:10,770
Oh, I see.

3637
03:08:11,070 --> 03:08:12,050
I see how it works.

3638
03:08:12,210 --> 03:08:12,290
Okay.

3639
03:08:13,790 --> 03:08:14,410
These suck.

3640
03:08:16,390 --> 03:08:17,610
Oh, why am I on that?

3641
03:08:17,770 --> 03:08:18,190
No, no, no.

3642
03:08:18,310 --> 03:08:18,430
Hold on.

3643
03:08:19,450 --> 03:08:20,170
Can I...

3644
03:08:20,870 --> 03:08:22,450
Oh, I can at least fight them.

3645
03:08:22,650 --> 03:08:23,190
I can, uh...

3646
03:08:23,590 --> 03:08:23,770
Okay.

3647
03:08:24,250 --> 03:08:25,310
I can get rid of them.

3648
03:08:26,670 --> 03:08:27,390
Before they...

3649
03:08:28,190 --> 03:08:28,550
Okay.

3650
03:08:35,430 --> 03:08:36,330
Jump, jump, jump.

3651
03:08:38,110 --> 03:08:39,010
Ooh, oh shoot.

3652
03:08:39,350 --> 03:08:39,670
Not bad.

3653
03:08:39,670 --> 03:08:40,910
Okay.

3654
03:08:43,410 --> 03:08:44,390
Oh, wait.

3655
03:08:44,730 --> 03:08:46,010
Ooh, that was so close.

3656
03:08:50,350 --> 03:08:51,150
Dog.

3657
03:09:08,280 --> 03:09:10,020
Come on, jump.

3658
03:09:14,440 --> 03:09:14,840
Oh.

3659
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:16,020
Already?

3660
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:17,940
We're getting rid of the...

3661
03:09:17,940 --> 03:09:20,240
We're getting rid of the...

3662
03:09:20,240 --> 03:09:20,780
We're getting rid of the...

3663
03:09:21,820 --> 03:09:22,460
Already?

3664
03:09:22,900 --> 03:09:23,540
Woo!

3665
03:09:23,880 --> 03:09:24,280
Oh shoot.

3666
03:09:24,660 --> 03:09:25,960
Just a little bit more.

3667
03:09:27,740 --> 03:09:28,300
Ah!

3668
03:09:28,580 --> 03:09:29,640
Oh, gosh.

3669
03:09:31,320 --> 03:09:32,180
That one's tough.

3670
03:09:32,820 --> 03:09:34,400
To dodge, rather.

3671
03:09:35,500 --> 03:09:35,780
Yeah.

3672
03:09:46,270 --> 03:09:47,110
Alright, it's okay though.

3673
03:09:48,070 --> 03:09:48,710
And...

3674
03:09:48,710 --> 03:09:49,010
Hooah!

3675
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:53,260
It's okay.

3676
03:10:03,820 --> 03:10:04,140
It's okay.

3677
03:10:06,060 --> 03:10:06,380
Oh.

3678
03:10:06,600 --> 03:10:06,660
Oh no!

3679
03:10:07,100 --> 03:10:08,440
I missed the ultimate, but it's okay.

3680
03:10:09,800 --> 03:10:10,520
He's almost down.

3681
03:10:14,590 --> 03:10:14,910
Eh.

3682
03:10:15,050 --> 03:10:15,750
Back up, back up.

3683
03:10:16,590 --> 03:10:16,910
It's

3684
03:10:20,010 --> 03:10:21,350
okay, I got it the first time.

3685
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:31,940
I saw someone tag and shoot me.

3686
03:10:37,310 --> 03:10:38,910
Let's get a little bit closer.

3687
03:10:41,330 --> 03:10:41,770
Oh!

3688
03:10:41,890 --> 03:10:42,150
Ow!

3689
03:10:42,690 --> 03:10:43,070
Dang it.

3690
03:10:46,390 --> 03:10:47,370
I guess, uh...

3691
03:10:47,370 --> 03:10:48,470
Let me change my...

3692
03:10:48,470 --> 03:10:49,250
Let's change too.

3693
03:10:49,650 --> 03:10:50,410
Wait, uh...

3694
03:10:50,410 --> 03:10:50,830
There we go.

3695
03:10:57,530 --> 03:10:57,970
Okay, we're going to freeze mode, I think.

3696
03:10:57,970 --> 03:10:58,970
Why can't I get the last one?

3697
03:10:59,450 --> 03:11:00,130
There we go.

3698
03:11:00,230 --> 03:11:00,590
Woop!

3699
03:11:04,150 --> 03:11:06,350
Okay, we're going to freeze mode, I think.

3700
03:11:07,170 --> 03:11:07,470
Yeah.

3701
03:11:14,630 --> 03:11:16,930
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3702
03:11:21,730 --> 03:11:23,290
I've played these games before.

3703
03:11:23,470 --> 03:11:23,990
Oh shoot.

3704
03:11:24,470 --> 03:11:25,190
Oh my god.

3705
03:11:27,050 --> 03:11:28,810
I've played these games before!

3706
03:11:30,130 --> 03:11:30,610
I've played these games before!

3707
03:11:30,610 --> 03:11:31,490
He's almost there.

3708
03:11:31,850 --> 03:11:32,330
Come on, Dante.

3709
03:11:32,670 --> 03:11:33,610
Just a little bit more!

3710
03:11:34,930 --> 03:11:36,350
Just a little bit more, Dante!

3711
03:11:37,010 --> 03:11:37,490
Yeah!

3712
03:11:42,040 --> 03:11:43,260
Oh, I forgot the hat.

3713
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:46,460
I did it before.

3714
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:47,020
I forgot.

3715
03:11:47,560 --> 03:11:48,440
It's okay though.

3716
03:11:48,580 --> 03:11:49,280
Don't worry about it.

3717
03:11:56,230 --> 03:11:57,070
Yippee!

3718
03:11:57,070 --> 03:11:57,910
Wow.

3719
03:12:00,810 --> 03:12:02,430
Lucy is crazy.

3720
03:12:05,350 --> 03:12:08,170
Oh my god, finally!

3721
03:12:08,850 --> 03:12:09,890
I missed you.

3722
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:48,040
Guess I'm the first one here.

3723
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:49,620
I like that.

3724
03:12:52,020 --> 03:12:53,220
Three-in-one weapon.

3725
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:54,560
I'm afraid.

3726
03:12:55,540 --> 03:12:57,280
I'm afraid of how this is going to work.

3727
03:13:05,440 --> 03:13:06,600
I'll be right back, guys.

3728
03:13:06,720 --> 03:13:08,160
I'm gonna go get some water real quick.

3729
03:13:08,840 --> 03:13:09,560
I'll be right back.

3730
03:13:58,770 --> 03:13:59,650
I'm back.

3731
03:14:00,670 --> 03:14:03,110
Yo, King Cerberus.

3732
03:14:03,230 --> 03:14:09,090
The power of King Cerberus dwells within this shape-shifting weapon, and charging attacks with ice, fire, and lightning in each form.

3733
03:14:11,510 --> 03:14:15,730
Twirl freezing with Y in Swordmaster.

3734
03:14:15,870 --> 03:14:21,130
You wield a blazing rod with B, or hold and release B to unleash an electrifying three-section staff.

3735
03:14:22,610 --> 03:14:23,350
Oh, boy.

3736
03:14:23,730 --> 03:14:25,190
I think that was super stylish today.

3737
03:14:26,530 --> 03:14:27,030
Ha, ha, ha.

3738
03:14:31,950 --> 03:14:33,390
The truth is...

3739
03:14:34,670 --> 03:14:36,010
I wanted to be protected...

3740
03:14:37,150 --> 03:14:38,070
and loved.

3741
03:14:38,070 --> 03:14:39,070
No...

3742
03:14:39,070 --> 03:14:39,750
But I was alone.

3743
03:14:40,990 --> 03:14:43,430
My only choice was to survive.

3744
03:14:44,170 --> 03:14:45,010
Oh...

3745
03:14:45,010 --> 03:14:45,830
V...

3746
03:14:45,830 --> 03:14:46,950
You gotta rest.

3747
03:14:49,750 --> 03:14:50,170
Miro...

3748
03:14:51,890 --> 03:14:54,310
And I will tell you...

3749
03:14:57,490 --> 03:14:58,330
Everything...

3750
03:14:58,330 --> 03:15:01,210
There is no demon...

3751
03:15:01,210 --> 03:15:01,510
Huh?

3752
03:15:01,770 --> 03:15:02,690
Named Urisen.

3753
03:15:03,590 --> 03:15:04,690
Wait, like...

3754
03:15:04,690 --> 03:15:05,190
Cause it's...

3755
03:15:05,190 --> 03:15:05,690
Only a man...

3756
03:15:05,690 --> 03:15:05,910
Yeah.

3757
03:15:06,670 --> 03:15:08,630
Who threw away his humanity...

3758
03:15:08,630 --> 03:15:09,430
But it's not...

3759
03:15:09,430 --> 03:15:11,130
In an endless pursuit of power.

3760
03:15:11,170 --> 03:15:12,030
But his name...

3761
03:15:12,030 --> 03:15:13,050
Is...

3762
03:15:13,050 --> 03:15:14,270
Yeah, cause it's just Urgil.

3763
03:15:15,730 --> 03:15:16,330
Oh...

3764
03:15:16,330 --> 03:15:17,150
Oh...

3765
03:15:17,150 --> 03:15:18,930
He is Dante's older brother.

3766
03:15:20,850 --> 03:15:21,450
No...

3767
03:15:22,730 --> 03:15:23,330
Dante's...

3768
03:15:23,330 --> 03:15:23,790
Brother?

3769
03:15:24,210 --> 03:15:24,610
Yes.

3770
03:15:27,710 --> 03:15:28,310
Urgil...

3771
03:15:29,270 --> 03:15:31,550
And his real name is...

3772
03:15:31,550 --> 03:15:31,970
Huh?

3773
03:15:36,850 --> 03:15:37,690
Virgil...

3774
03:15:40,460 --> 03:15:41,300
Virgil...

3775
03:15:44,600 --> 03:15:45,180
What the?

3776
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:49,380
Brothers...

3777
03:15:51,220 --> 03:15:52,060
Brothers...

3778
03:15:55,910 --> 03:15:56,750
Virgil...

3779
03:15:58,770 --> 03:15:59,610
Brothers...

3780
03:15:59,610 --> 03:16:00,590
Wait, is that their house?

3781
03:16:02,870 --> 03:16:04,450
Am I gonna fight Virgil?

3782
03:16:04,710 --> 03:16:05,770
Oh gosh.

3783
03:16:07,090 --> 03:16:07,930
Oh no.

3784
03:16:08,830 --> 03:16:10,610
Let's buy a pour real quick.

3785
03:16:18,110 --> 03:16:20,170
And everything's out of stock, baby.

3786
03:16:23,270 --> 03:16:24,510
Did you miss Virgil?

3787
03:16:25,170 --> 03:16:26,150
I don't know.

3788
03:16:30,840 --> 03:16:31,940
Do you feel ready?

3789
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:32,500
Uh-uh.

3790
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:36,560
Uh...

3791
03:16:36,560 --> 03:16:37,880
Asked a question in a super chat.

3792
03:16:38,140 --> 03:16:39,160
Just as you were leaving.

3793
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:40,520
Oh...

3794
03:16:41,360 --> 03:16:41,920
Uh...

3795
03:16:42,920 --> 03:16:43,480
Uh...

3796
03:16:43,480 --> 03:16:44,340
Hold on.

3797
03:16:47,200 --> 03:16:47,760
Uh...

3798
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:49,900
Planning to leave a spoiler-proof comment...

3799
03:16:49,900 --> 03:16:53,000
Listing everything DMC5 carried over from DMC Devil May Cry.

3800
03:16:53,440 --> 03:16:54,620
Unless you don't want me to.

3801
03:16:56,520 --> 03:16:57,080
Uh...

3802
03:16:57,880 --> 03:16:58,900
I think, uh...

3803
03:16:58,900 --> 03:17:00,380
Once I end the game, it'll be okay.

3804
03:17:02,220 --> 03:17:02,580
Probably.

3805
03:17:02,760 --> 03:17:06,140
Since I'm still not sure if I'll play DMC Devil May Cry yet.

3806
03:17:07,820 --> 03:17:08,820
But thanks for asking.

3807
03:17:14,400 --> 03:17:14,760
Um...

3808
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:17,160
In the future, you could always ask in comments too.

3809
03:17:17,400 --> 03:17:19,140
You don't have to send money to ask.

3810
03:17:19,880 --> 03:17:21,240
Because I read comments.

3811
03:17:22,860 --> 03:17:23,900
Missed so many missions.

3812
03:17:24,240 --> 03:17:25,280
What have my grades been?

3813
03:17:25,640 --> 03:17:26,780
Um... I...

3814
03:17:26,780 --> 03:17:27,120
Uh...

3815
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:27,840
Well, it doesn't matter.

3816
03:17:27,940 --> 03:17:29,000
Because C's get degrees.

3817
03:17:30,860 --> 03:17:31,740
Doesn't matter.

3818
03:17:36,130 --> 03:17:37,170
I'm passing.

3819
03:17:37,310 --> 03:17:37,870
I'm passing.

3820
03:17:40,590 --> 03:17:41,650
I'm passing.

3821
03:17:43,090 --> 03:17:45,450
I think I probably have all that...

3822
03:17:45,450 --> 03:17:45,910
Well...

3823
03:17:46,270 --> 03:17:47,250
I haven't even...

3824
03:17:47,250 --> 03:17:47,930
You...

3825
03:17:48,450 --> 03:17:48,870
Revolver.

3826
03:17:49,150 --> 03:17:50,990
I haven't even used Cerberus yet.

3827
03:17:50,990 --> 03:17:52,610
So I don't know if I want to...

3828
03:17:53,730 --> 03:17:55,030
This is always a...

3829
03:17:55,030 --> 03:17:56,050
This is always a staple...

3830
03:17:56,050 --> 03:17:56,590
Oh my gosh.

3831
03:17:56,730 --> 03:17:57,130
It's a...

3832
03:17:57,130 --> 03:17:58,130
I remember.

3833
03:17:58,430 --> 03:17:59,090
From before.

3834
03:18:00,250 --> 03:18:01,450
4.0.

3835
03:18:01,450 --> 03:18:01,650
So...

3836
03:18:01,650 --> 03:18:03,010
You're gonna hate this boss.

3837
03:18:03,890 --> 03:18:05,890
If it's anything like...

3838
03:18:06,670 --> 03:18:07,890
Virgil in 3...

3839
03:18:07,890 --> 03:18:08,970
Yeah, I'm gonna hate it.

3840
03:18:09,230 --> 03:18:09,550
Hahaha.

3841
03:18:12,130 --> 03:18:13,250
Wait, so...

3842
03:18:13,250 --> 03:18:15,030
What mission was this?

3843
03:18:22,770 --> 03:18:23,330
No.

3844
03:18:23,670 --> 03:18:24,030
Okay.

3845
03:18:25,370 --> 03:18:25,650
17...

3846
03:18:26,370 --> 03:18:26,930
18...

3847
03:18:26,930 --> 03:18:28,690
Wait, 17, 18, 19, 20...

3848
03:18:29,430 --> 03:18:30,830
Okay, so still...

3849
03:18:30,830 --> 03:18:31,270
Four more.

3850
03:18:31,530 --> 03:18:31,810
Alright.

3851
03:18:32,170 --> 03:18:33,070
We got this.

3852
03:18:33,610 --> 03:18:34,530
We got this.

3853
03:18:34,530 --> 03:18:35,350
I think I started what?

3854
03:18:35,530 --> 03:18:35,910
At 13?

3855
03:18:36,530 --> 03:18:36,790
Yeah.

3856
03:18:38,330 --> 03:18:39,330
Four more.

3857
03:18:43,550 --> 03:18:44,750
I'm just gonna go into it.

3858
03:18:48,910 --> 03:18:49,630
Worries.

3859
03:18:50,130 --> 03:18:51,510
That means no worries.

3860
03:18:52,010 --> 03:18:54,130
For the rest of your days.

3861
03:18:57,630 --> 03:18:58,430
Ooh, apple.

3862
03:19:01,410 --> 03:19:02,130
Virgil.

3863
03:19:06,110 --> 03:19:06,630
Hey!

3864
03:19:06,970 --> 03:19:08,650
Is that the damn fruit you've been jabbering about?

3865
03:19:09,010 --> 03:19:10,570
Doesn't look so special to me.

3866
03:19:10,890 --> 03:19:11,870
A plee plee.

3867
03:19:17,720 --> 03:19:19,720
Why can't they just be friends?

3868
03:19:21,140 --> 03:19:22,320
This is where it all started.

3869
03:19:24,220 --> 03:19:26,620
That day mother saved me and...

3870
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:29,340
Left you behind.

3871
03:19:32,500 --> 03:19:34,100
The thing you don't know is...

3872
03:19:34,100 --> 03:19:35,400
She tried to save you too.

3873
03:19:35,840 --> 03:19:37,320
She kept searching and searching.

3874
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:38,680
She kept searching and searching.

3875
03:19:38,780 --> 03:19:40,160
Until I killed her.

3876
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:44,620
I have no recollection of this tale.

3877
03:19:45,900 --> 03:19:47,260
Or this place.

3878
03:19:48,060 --> 03:19:49,460
It's all an illusion.

3879
03:19:51,040 --> 03:19:51,800
Created...

3880
03:19:52,940 --> 03:19:55,080
By this extraordinary fruit.

3881
03:19:55,100 --> 03:19:56,320
I look so juicy.

3882
03:19:56,840 --> 03:19:58,320
It's power, you see.

3883
03:19:58,980 --> 03:20:02,100
Is all I ever wanted.

3884
03:20:02,100 --> 03:20:04,580
And this...

3885
03:20:04,580 --> 03:20:05,220
No.

3886
03:20:05,920 --> 03:20:06,020
No!

3887
03:20:06,440 --> 03:20:07,060
I...

3888
03:20:07,060 --> 03:20:08,100
Will have...

3889
03:20:09,280 --> 03:20:10,120
Everything!

3890
03:20:11,240 --> 03:20:13,020
Yeah, take a big ol' juicy bite.

3891
03:20:13,240 --> 03:20:13,380
Ooh!

3892
03:20:13,960 --> 03:20:15,240
Oh my gosh.

3893
03:20:15,680 --> 03:20:18,440
I wish that were me this entire...

3894
03:20:18,440 --> 03:20:20,580
This entire like...

3895
03:20:20,580 --> 03:20:21,160
Level.

3896
03:20:24,640 --> 03:20:25,820
Oh no!

3897
03:20:25,820 --> 03:20:25,920
Woo!

3898
03:20:29,180 --> 03:20:30,080
No brother!

3899
03:20:30,660 --> 03:20:30,700
Ha!

3900
03:20:31,180 --> 03:20:32,160
You don't have everything!

3901
03:20:32,320 --> 03:20:32,920
No brother!

3902
03:20:34,040 --> 03:20:36,700
That last shred of humanity that you still had?

3903
03:20:38,200 --> 03:20:39,720
You just lost it.

3904
03:20:41,300 --> 03:20:42,020
Oh...

3905
03:20:45,980 --> 03:20:47,120
He's shedding!

3906
03:20:48,340 --> 03:20:49,060
He's...

3907
03:20:49,060 --> 03:20:50,080
It's molting season!

3908
03:20:50,860 --> 03:20:51,500
And then...

3909
03:20:52,380 --> 03:20:53,020
Oh...

3910
03:20:54,740 --> 03:20:55,840
Oh golly.

3911
03:21:00,600 --> 03:21:01,240
Woohoo!

3912
03:21:02,860 --> 03:21:03,780
Oh gosh.

3913
03:21:04,440 --> 03:21:05,200
Okay, Urgil.

3914
03:21:10,260 --> 03:21:10,900
Scat...

3915
03:21:10,900 --> 03:21:13,340
Alright, come...

3916
03:21:13,340 --> 03:21:13,640
I'm...

3917
03:21:13,640 --> 03:21:14,900
I'm afraid to get close to him.

3918
03:21:15,080 --> 03:21:15,240
Wah!

3919
03:21:15,240 --> 03:21:15,800
Okay.

3920
03:21:26,620 --> 03:21:27,420
Oh!

3921
03:21:27,920 --> 03:21:28,820
Damn, he hits hard.

3922
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:33,160
I could try this.

3923
03:21:34,420 --> 03:21:35,400
Kick him instead?

3924
03:21:37,340 --> 03:21:38,140
Woo

3925
03:21:43,060 --> 03:21:43,540
woo woo!

3926
03:21:44,280 --> 03:21:45,500
Wait, you...

3927
03:21:45,500 --> 03:21:46,220
Ow!

3928
03:21:47,180 --> 03:21:48,240
Where's my...

3929
03:21:48,240 --> 03:21:48,860
Where's my kicks?

3930
03:21:49,360 --> 03:21:50,100
There we go.

3931
03:21:51,240 --> 03:21:52,220
Give him the hat!

3932
03:21:52,220 --> 03:21:53,780
Oh, where's my hat?

3933
03:21:54,480 --> 03:21:55,160
Oh, wait.

3934
03:21:55,380 --> 03:21:55,860
There it is.

3935
03:21:56,500 --> 03:21:57,760
I lost my hat.

3936
03:21:58,460 --> 03:21:59,260
Oh my gosh.

3937
03:21:59,400 --> 03:22:00,880
I'm just running around in circles right now.

3938
03:22:00,960 --> 03:22:01,660
I'm trying to read him.

3939
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:06,360
Oh, right in the nuts!

3940
03:22:08,540 --> 03:22:08,940
Ouch!

3941
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:09,420
Ouch!

3942
03:22:09,920 --> 03:22:11,260
Oh my god, I'm trying to get up.

3943
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:13,340
Don't kick me while I'm down, bro.

3944
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:15,620
That's not very kind of you.

3945
03:22:18,560 --> 03:22:19,620
Wait, where am I?

3946
03:22:19,860 --> 03:22:20,700
I can't even see.

3947
03:22:20,820 --> 03:22:21,480
He's so tall.

3948
03:22:25,760 --> 03:22:27,700
Stop punching the ground!

3949
03:22:29,180 --> 03:22:30,220
I'll kick you back!

3950
03:22:38,320 --> 03:22:39,320
Oh my gosh.

3951
03:22:43,080 --> 03:22:44,000
Oh!

3952
03:22:45,540 --> 03:22:46,920
Let's try this.

3953
03:22:56,190 --> 03:22:58,050
Oh, I'm gonna get...

3954
03:23:00,630 --> 03:23:01,330
Yeah!

3955
03:23:05,110 --> 03:23:05,870
Uh-oh.

3956
03:23:11,870 --> 03:23:13,870
It was a little far away!

3957
03:23:16,610 --> 03:23:19,010
It was a little far away!

3958
03:23:29,410 --> 03:23:30,310
That was close.

3959
03:23:31,250 --> 03:23:32,950
I'm gonna go back to rebellion.

3960
03:23:37,470 --> 03:23:37,990
Stop.

3961
03:23:39,310 --> 03:23:40,170
Oh my gosh.

3962
03:23:43,450 --> 03:23:46,310
I wish... Do I heal in SDT or no?

3963
03:23:47,550 --> 03:23:51,230
Do you heal in... Oh, it's not rebellion.

3964
03:23:51,550 --> 03:23:51,930
You're right.

3965
03:23:52,110 --> 03:23:52,950
It's the... What's it called?

3966
03:23:53,850 --> 03:23:55,170
Only in normal DT.

3967
03:23:55,410 --> 03:23:55,570
Okay.

3968
03:23:55,730 --> 03:23:55,830
Okay.

3969
03:23:55,990 --> 03:23:56,130
Okay.

3970
03:23:58,890 --> 03:23:59,410
Okay.

3971
03:23:59,410 --> 03:23:59,510
Okay.

3972
03:23:59,790 --> 03:24:00,350
Good to know.

3973
03:24:03,290 --> 03:24:05,410
Yeah, it is a good reason to use normal DT.

3974
03:24:08,370 --> 03:24:09,390
Devil's sword daunting.

3975
03:24:09,610 --> 03:24:09,850
Sorry.

3976
03:24:10,210 --> 03:24:10,510
Sorry.

3977
03:24:10,610 --> 03:24:11,310
I said rebellion.

3978
03:24:12,270 --> 03:24:13,130
Rebellion's gone.

3979
03:24:14,210 --> 03:24:15,170
It's my bad.

3980
03:24:15,530 --> 03:24:15,710
Okay.

3981
03:24:15,770 --> 03:24:16,230
Let's try again.

3982
03:24:26,720 --> 03:24:28,280
No more rebellion.

3983
03:24:31,480 --> 03:24:33,220
Yeah, Dante is using Dante.

3984
03:24:33,460 --> 03:24:33,980
Oh my god.

3985
03:24:34,080 --> 03:24:35,240
It just sticks me in there.

3986
03:24:39,080 --> 03:24:41,600
I don't think... I don't think he liked my hat.

3987
03:24:45,260 --> 03:24:46,820
I don't think he likes it.

3988
03:24:49,940 --> 03:24:50,420
Wait.

3989
03:24:50,620 --> 03:24:51,220
Let's see.

3990
03:25:05,420 --> 03:25:06,760
And then he tried and kicked me.

3991
03:25:07,260 --> 03:25:07,660
Oh.

3992
03:25:07,800 --> 03:25:07,960
Ow.

3993
03:25:08,120 --> 03:25:08,280
Damn.

3994
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:09,920
Oh, I ran right into that one.

3995
03:25:11,220 --> 03:25:11,620
And

3996
03:25:25,370 --> 03:25:26,450
he totally missed it.

3997
03:25:27,090 --> 03:25:28,710
You got... You weren't paying attention.

3998
03:25:28,990 --> 03:25:30,430
I put the hat on him already.

3999
03:25:30,610 --> 03:25:31,190
Yeah, I did.

4000
03:25:41,550 --> 03:25:43,310
Oh, I laughed about it.

4001
03:25:48,950 --> 03:25:49,330
I

4002
03:25:56,360 --> 03:25:57,500
forgot that I have the hat on.

4003
03:25:57,680 --> 03:25:59,100
So I'm losing Rorbs when I do that.

4004
03:26:04,940 --> 03:26:05,940
Hold on real quick.

4005
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:07,160
I know I'm running in circles.

4006
03:26:08,060 --> 03:26:08,940
I'm gonna...

4007
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:09,500
I'm gonna...

4008
03:26:26,790 --> 03:26:27,330
Woo!

4009
03:26:27,590 --> 03:26:27,750
Woo!

4010
03:26:28,010 --> 03:26:28,210
Woo!

4011
03:26:28,510 --> 03:26:28,570
Woo!

4012
03:26:28,610 --> 03:26:28,610
Woo!

4013
03:26:29,390 --> 03:26:30,950
My brother's got moves.

4014
03:26:31,850 --> 03:26:32,990
My brother's got moves.

4015
03:26:33,850 --> 03:26:34,350
All right.

4016
03:26:34,450 --> 03:26:35,610
Now we'll save up.

4017
03:26:37,010 --> 03:26:37,350
Oh!

4018
03:26:37,710 --> 03:26:38,150
Ah!

4019
03:26:38,310 --> 03:26:38,530
Damn!

4020
03:26:39,090 --> 03:26:40,650
Oh, you sucker!

4021
03:26:43,310 --> 03:26:43,950
You sucker!

4022
03:26:45,670 --> 03:26:46,950
You suck!

4023
03:26:53,240 --> 03:26:55,240
It's like going in between his legs.

4024
03:26:55,820 --> 03:26:56,280
Okay.

4025
03:26:56,600 --> 03:26:57,500
I change.

4026
03:26:57,720 --> 03:26:58,400
I change weapon.

4027
03:27:01,700 --> 03:27:02,680
Oh my god.

4028
03:27:06,100 --> 03:27:07,580
I'm just trying to...

4029
03:27:07,580 --> 03:27:09,620
I'm trying to get DT...

4030
03:27:09,620 --> 03:27:10,320
While I'm...

4031
03:27:10,320 --> 03:27:10,960
Away from him.

4032
03:27:23,260 --> 03:27:24,340
Oh, air taunt.

4033
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:24,860
Yeah, true.

4034
03:27:27,240 --> 03:27:28,400
I threw the rose.

4035
03:27:30,260 --> 03:27:30,700
Oh!

4036
03:27:35,990 --> 03:27:37,010
Oh, that was close.

4037
03:27:38,910 --> 03:27:40,110
Oh, he's so fast.

4038
03:27:41,430 --> 03:27:43,190
And then he kicks me in.

4039
03:27:43,570 --> 03:27:45,210
Because I have to like get...

4040
03:27:45,210 --> 03:27:45,290
I know.

4041
03:27:45,510 --> 03:27:47,090
Because it's a good position to not be...

4042
03:27:47,090 --> 03:27:47,730
Hit...

4043
03:27:47,730 --> 03:27:48,930
Not be punched by him.

4044
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:51,610
Okay, like here.

4045
03:27:51,790 --> 03:27:52,730
But then he kicks me!

4046
03:27:52,730 --> 03:27:54,110
But if I'm in the air, then it's okay.

4047
03:27:54,510 --> 03:27:54,870
Oh my gosh.

4048
03:27:55,050 --> 03:27:55,330
Oh!

4049
03:28:12,830 --> 03:28:13,690
What's he gonna do?

4050
03:28:19,610 --> 03:28:20,810
Can I hit this?

4051
03:28:20,990 --> 03:28:22,150
Was it that I...

4052
03:28:23,830 --> 03:28:24,230
Ow!

4053
03:28:24,970 --> 03:28:25,610
Okay, no.

4054
03:28:25,950 --> 03:28:26,830
No, don't try.

4055
03:28:27,150 --> 03:28:28,130
Don't try to do that.

4056
03:28:28,670 --> 03:28:28,690
Hahaha!

4057
03:28:38,080 --> 03:28:38,980
I'll challenge, I'll...

4058
03:28:43,740 --> 03:28:44,320
How?

4059
03:28:44,620 --> 03:28:45,600
How did he hit me?

4060
03:28:46,020 --> 03:28:46,860
I was running!

4061
03:28:48,140 --> 03:28:50,060
Alright, it's time for the big boy to come out.

4062
03:28:50,060 --> 03:28:50,360
Ow!

4063
03:28:54,640 --> 03:28:55,220
No!

4064
03:29:07,660 --> 03:29:08,080
Please!

4065
03:29:09,180 --> 03:29:09,760
Oh!

4066
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:10,900
I missed it!

4067
03:29:12,860 --> 03:29:14,020
I missed...

4068
03:29:14,020 --> 03:29:14,740
I'll try...

4069
03:29:14,740 --> 03:29:16,020
I pressed X and Y.

4070
03:29:16,160 --> 03:29:16,640
Didn't work.

4071
03:29:34,090 --> 03:29:35,650
I feel like we got so far.

4072
03:29:40,170 --> 03:29:41,310
One more try.

4073
03:29:42,070 --> 03:29:43,130
We can do one more try.

4074
03:29:43,390 --> 03:29:46,650
I only get so far because of Lucy anyway.

4075
03:29:46,970 --> 03:29:47,310
Hahaha!

4076
03:29:49,170 --> 03:29:50,090
I only do...

4077
03:29:50,090 --> 03:29:50,910
I only get so far...

4078
03:29:50,910 --> 03:29:54,090
I wanna save as many Gorphs as I need to for the...

4079
03:29:54,710 --> 03:29:56,110
For the last bosses.

4080
03:29:56,750 --> 03:29:56,910
You know?

4081
03:29:58,090 --> 03:29:59,470
You'll need the Gorphs later.

4082
03:29:59,710 --> 03:29:59,850
Yeah.

4083
03:30:02,550 --> 03:30:02,990
Yeah.

4084
03:30:05,510 --> 03:30:06,390
Oh, wait.

4085
03:30:06,510 --> 03:30:07,190
That's not what I meant to do.

4086
03:30:07,410 --> 03:30:07,630
Hahaha!

4087
03:30:09,410 --> 03:30:10,310
I'm gonna give you a hat.

4088
03:30:10,950 --> 03:30:11,390
Hahaha!

4089
03:30:13,050 --> 03:30:13,550
Oh god, no.

4090
03:30:16,800 --> 03:30:18,900
Guys, we're not starting off very strong.

4091
03:30:19,680 --> 03:30:20,200
Um...

4092
03:30:25,640 --> 03:30:27,160
Not starting off too strong.

4093
03:30:27,740 --> 03:30:28,420
It's okay.

4094
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:29,940
It's my fault.

4095
03:30:30,460 --> 03:30:30,540
Hahaha!

4096
03:30:31,380 --> 03:30:31,820
Come on!

4097
03:30:33,060 --> 03:30:34,040
Come on!

4098
03:30:38,290 --> 03:30:38,810
Please!

4099
03:30:39,730 --> 03:30:41,690
At least he can only kick me or...

4100
03:30:42,470 --> 03:30:42,990
You...

4101
03:30:42,990 --> 03:30:43,730
I hate this guy.

4102
03:30:43,830 --> 03:30:44,430
He's such a...

4103
03:30:44,430 --> 03:30:45,830
He's such a squirrel.

4104
03:30:47,170 --> 03:30:48,190
Guys, not...

4105
03:30:48,190 --> 03:30:49,110
We're not doing so great.

4106
03:30:49,370 --> 03:30:49,730
Guys.

4107
03:30:49,970 --> 03:30:50,370
Guys.

4108
03:30:50,790 --> 03:30:51,290
Guys.

4109
03:30:52,030 --> 03:30:52,550
Guys!

4110
03:30:52,830 --> 03:30:53,330
Guys!

4111
03:30:54,490 --> 03:30:55,010
Guys!

4112
03:30:55,010 --> 03:30:55,130
Guys!

4113
03:30:57,630 --> 03:30:58,650
Guys, I'm struggling.

4114
03:30:58,990 --> 03:31:00,270
Guys, I'm struggling a little.

4115
03:31:01,150 --> 03:31:02,550
Guys, I'm struggling a little.

4116
03:31:02,750 --> 03:31:04,090
Guys, I'm struggling a little.

4117
03:31:04,550 --> 03:31:04,990
Hahaha!

4118
03:31:18,350 --> 03:31:20,550
Is airbite gonna be that much of a difference?

4119
03:31:20,570 --> 03:31:21,010
I wonder.

4120
03:31:22,930 --> 03:31:24,590
Guess I can get a couple hits in there.

4121
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:34,120
Oh!

4122
03:31:34,700 --> 03:31:34,920
Oh!

4123
03:31:46,780 --> 03:31:47,220
Oh!

4124
03:31:47,220 --> 03:31:47,280
Oh!

4125
03:32:00,520 --> 03:32:01,780
Let me try it.

4126
03:32:04,080 --> 03:32:04,560
See!

4127
03:32:04,720 --> 03:32:05,580
He just backs up!

4128
03:32:06,060 --> 03:32:06,360
Hahaha!

4129
03:32:08,180 --> 03:32:09,180
He's just like...

4130
03:32:09,180 --> 03:32:09,640
What are you trying?

4131
03:32:09,760 --> 03:32:11,020
Give me that with that part.

4132
03:32:17,430 --> 03:32:18,370
Yeah, I wish I'm here.

4133
03:32:19,070 --> 03:32:20,050
It's actually me.

4134
03:32:21,210 --> 03:32:22,610
He's asking that to me.

4135
03:32:24,290 --> 03:32:24,770
Hahaha!

4136
03:32:25,330 --> 03:32:26,410
Dante, I don't want to hear it.

4137
03:32:27,970 --> 03:32:28,450
Oh!

4138
03:32:28,630 --> 03:32:28,970
Oh!

4139
03:32:29,250 --> 03:32:29,730
Oh!

4140
03:32:29,990 --> 03:32:30,470
Oh!

4141
03:32:30,470 --> 03:32:32,370
Oh, but I got hit him, man.

4142
03:32:35,470 --> 03:32:36,510
I wonder...

4143
03:33:00,730 --> 03:33:01,770
Please come back.

4144
03:33:02,030 --> 03:33:02,630
Please come back.

4145
03:33:02,730 --> 03:33:02,730
Should

4146
03:33:25,600 --> 03:33:26,200
I...

4147
03:33:26,200 --> 03:33:26,720
Man.

4148
03:33:44,670 --> 03:33:45,190
Man.

4149
03:33:46,550 --> 03:33:47,350
I'm bored.

4150
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:48,070
Hahaha!

4151
03:33:54,640 --> 03:33:55,700
Swordmaster only run!

4152
03:33:58,040 --> 03:33:58,560
Oh!

4153
03:33:58,780 --> 03:33:59,020
Wait.

4154
03:33:59,200 --> 03:33:59,860
Oh, don't kick me.

4155
03:34:26,280 --> 03:34:27,060
It's nothing.

4156
03:34:27,280 --> 03:34:27,720
I'm useless.

4157
03:34:27,940 --> 03:34:28,240
Shit!

4158
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:31,940
Don't try to hit the thing.

4159
03:34:43,550 --> 03:34:47,210
It feels good to taunt and then actually dodge the tank.

4160
03:34:53,950 --> 03:34:55,250
What weapon am I on?

4161
03:34:55,330 --> 03:34:56,570
Okay, let's get back to this.

4162
03:35:05,020 --> 03:35:05,700
Me too.

4163
03:35:09,470 --> 03:35:11,530
Run away, run away, run away, run away.

4164
03:35:16,590 --> 03:35:17,490
Dante, no, oh no.

4165
03:35:17,890 --> 03:35:18,910
I tried to get out of it.

4166
03:35:20,710 --> 03:35:21,870
I tried to get out of it.

4167
03:35:26,110 --> 03:35:26,890
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4168
03:35:26,970 --> 03:35:27,570
Oh, I didn't see them.

4169
03:35:28,050 --> 03:35:28,590
Oh my god.

4170
03:35:28,810 --> 03:35:29,810
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4171
03:35:30,650 --> 03:35:32,250
Wait, but I want to use a big move.

4172
03:35:34,670 --> 03:35:34,950
Okay,

4173
03:35:38,030 --> 03:35:38,590
get up to him.

4174
03:35:39,230 --> 03:35:40,350
There we go, there we go.

4175
03:35:40,610 --> 03:35:45,910
Oh my gosh, that camera angle change.

4176
03:35:46,710 --> 03:35:47,790
Alright, I'm gonna...

4177
03:35:48,950 --> 03:35:49,910
Time to use the big boy.

4178
03:35:51,230 --> 03:35:51,950
No, never mind.

4179
03:35:52,150 --> 03:35:52,790
It's not time yet.

4180
03:35:53,790 --> 03:35:54,410
Oh my gosh.

4181
03:35:54,870 --> 03:35:56,430
Dante, just a little bit more time, please.

4182
03:35:57,630 --> 03:35:58,350
Once I...

4183
03:35:58,350 --> 03:35:59,770
Once the birds were out of this thing.

4184
03:36:00,090 --> 03:36:00,270
Okay.

4185
03:36:00,710 --> 03:36:01,370
Alright, there we go.

4186
03:36:01,650 --> 03:36:01,930
Time.

4187
03:36:03,870 --> 03:36:04,230
Okay.

4188
03:36:05,130 --> 03:36:05,490
Okay.

4189
03:36:05,710 --> 03:36:06,510
Just a little bit more.

4190
03:36:06,610 --> 03:36:07,190
Just a little bit more.

4191
03:36:08,730 --> 03:36:09,570
Just a little bit more.

4192
03:36:10,510 --> 03:36:11,310
Oh my god.

4193
03:36:11,450 --> 03:36:11,550
Oh my god.

4194
03:36:11,550 --> 03:36:11,870
Nope, nope, nope.

4195
03:36:11,930 --> 03:36:12,150
Not yet.

4196
03:36:12,510 --> 03:36:13,750
Holy cow.

4197
03:36:18,290 --> 03:36:19,690
I didn't notice.

4198
03:36:20,210 --> 03:36:20,730
Oh, good.

4199
03:36:21,370 --> 03:36:21,690
Alright.

4200
03:36:23,070 --> 03:36:23,630
Okay.

4201
03:36:30,490 --> 03:36:32,090
Oh, I'm taking so much damage.

4202
03:36:33,790 --> 03:36:34,390
So cheap.

4203
03:36:41,380 --> 03:36:42,800
I'm in slow-mo.

4204
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:44,960
Ahahaha.

4205
03:36:45,160 --> 03:36:45,920
I'm in slow-mo.

4206
03:36:46,140 --> 03:36:46,780
Ahahaha.

4207
03:36:49,800 --> 03:36:50,440
Ahahaha.

4208
03:36:53,410 --> 03:36:54,050
Ahahaha.

4209
03:36:56,710 --> 03:36:57,110
Um.

4210
03:36:57,110 --> 03:36:59,810
Oh, what is this?

4211
03:37:02,370 --> 03:37:03,890
Because I'm not good, baby!

4212
03:37:15,530 --> 03:37:16,210
They're brothers?

4213
03:37:16,810 --> 03:37:18,270
Why are they fighting each other?

4214
03:37:18,550 --> 03:37:26,730
To see one's justice through, a man must fight for it, even if the one who stands before him is his kin.

4215
03:37:28,610 --> 03:37:30,170
That's ridiculous.

4216
03:37:30,970 --> 03:37:36,810
The Brothers of Blood disagree on the very reason of their existence.

4217
03:37:37,330 --> 03:37:40,110
They must fight.

4218
03:37:43,590 --> 03:37:45,430
Swordmaster only run!

4219
03:37:54,770 --> 03:37:56,810
Daunte 3, Virgil 0.

4220
03:37:57,130 --> 03:38:00,590
Doesn't feel that... Mentally... Mentally, Virgil 3.

4221
03:38:00,590 --> 03:38:01,490
You're late.

4222
03:38:02,290 --> 03:38:03,510
Just finishing up.

4223
03:38:04,730 --> 03:38:06,010
Is that really your brother?

4224
03:38:06,770 --> 03:38:07,970
I'm afraid so.

4225
03:38:08,730 --> 03:38:10,230
So he was behind all this.

4226
03:38:10,830 --> 03:38:12,050
You know, flesh and blood.

4227
03:38:12,450 --> 03:38:14,670
Doesn't look like much flesh there.

4228
03:38:17,250 --> 03:38:18,450
Fusion dance!

4229
03:38:19,410 --> 03:38:22,190
In the last throes of defeat, I see...

4230
03:38:25,010 --> 03:38:25,450
You...

4231
03:38:26,910 --> 03:38:28,310
Yeah, get his ass, V.

4232
03:38:28,590 --> 03:38:29,370
Get his ass!

4233
03:38:30,950 --> 03:38:32,550
Things are about to get really messy.

4234
03:38:32,570 --> 03:38:34,650
Oh my god, the sky is like even breaking apart.

4235
03:38:34,990 --> 03:38:35,410
No, please...

4236
03:38:35,410 --> 03:38:37,330
Their little fantasy illusion world.

4237
03:38:38,030 --> 03:38:39,170
V needs some milk.

4238
03:38:40,490 --> 03:38:42,110
He looks actually better this way.

4239
03:38:42,230 --> 03:38:42,910
He looks like a lizard.

4240
03:38:45,930 --> 03:38:48,090
I like lizard V better.

4241
03:38:55,050 --> 03:38:56,050
I like

4242
03:38:59,810 --> 03:39:01,290
the illusion of shattering.

4243
03:39:03,730 --> 03:39:06,890
Oh my god, quit groaning, Urgil.

4244
03:39:12,370 --> 03:39:15,190
He's just moaning and groaning down there.

4245
03:39:16,670 --> 03:39:18,050
Not lose.

4246
03:39:18,510 --> 03:39:19,170
Round two.

4247
03:39:19,550 --> 03:39:20,830
Not Adante.

4248
03:39:22,870 --> 03:39:24,670
I need power.

4249
03:39:25,510 --> 03:39:27,410
More power.

4250
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:34,700
Wait.

4251
03:39:37,380 --> 03:39:38,080
Yeah.

4252
03:39:40,640 --> 03:39:41,580
What's happening?

4253
03:39:44,560 --> 03:39:47,360
Oh no.

4254
03:39:48,380 --> 03:39:49,100
No, Virgil.

4255
03:39:49,100 --> 03:39:49,960
I mean...

4256
03:39:49,960 --> 03:39:50,080
Wait.

4257
03:39:50,580 --> 03:39:50,780
No.

4258
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:51,640
V, no.

4259
03:39:52,340 --> 03:39:54,060
Oh no, no, no, no!

4260
03:40:00,240 --> 03:40:01,060
Stop him!

4261
03:40:01,560 --> 03:40:02,800
Stop the dust man!

4262
03:40:03,160 --> 03:40:03,840
Stop him!

4263
03:40:04,040 --> 03:40:04,640
Stop him!

4264
03:40:05,920 --> 03:40:06,940
Oh no.

4265
03:40:16,590 --> 03:40:17,730
Oh, oh!

4266
03:40:19,190 --> 03:40:20,950
Oh, oh, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

4267
03:40:21,250 --> 03:40:22,170
Oh, ah!

4268
03:40:33,440 --> 03:40:34,460
What is this?

4269
03:40:37,220 --> 03:40:37,820
Virgil.

4270
03:40:37,980 --> 03:40:38,840
That's his brother!

4271
03:40:39,780 --> 03:40:40,520
Oh my god.

4272
03:40:46,990 --> 03:40:47,590
Virgil!

4273
03:40:47,750 --> 03:40:50,090
The Alpha and the Omega.

4274
03:41:10,900 --> 03:41:12,020
Can I get a happy birthday?

4275
03:41:12,120 --> 03:41:13,060
Happy birthday, Matt!

4276
03:41:13,720 --> 03:41:15,000
We're back in here.

4277
03:41:25,580 --> 03:41:27,400
But we fought together before.

4278
03:41:27,900 --> 03:41:28,640
We did.

4279
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:29,940
Oh my god, it's his book.

4280
03:41:31,660 --> 03:41:33,620
Full of jokes and puns.

4281
03:41:38,040 --> 03:41:40,780
He has come to Urgil.

4282
03:41:44,900 --> 03:41:45,700
Holy...

4283
03:41:55,900 --> 03:41:57,860
We fought together before.

4284
03:41:58,680 --> 03:41:59,680
We're family!

4285
03:42:01,180 --> 03:42:02,420
Oh my god.

4286
03:42:07,280 --> 03:42:08,600
Defeating me like this.

4287
03:42:09,280 --> 03:42:10,420
That's no meaning.

4288
03:42:11,200 --> 03:42:12,480
Come on, Virgil.

4289
03:42:12,940 --> 03:42:13,720
Let's do this.

4290
03:42:13,940 --> 03:42:14,940
Defeating me like this.

4291
03:42:15,480 --> 03:42:17,020
Heal your wounds, Dante.

4292
03:42:17,620 --> 03:42:18,420
Get strong.

4293
03:42:19,360 --> 03:42:22,120
After that, we'll settle the matter.

4294
03:42:25,500 --> 03:42:26,540
Oh my god.

4295
03:42:26,860 --> 03:42:26,960
Oh my god.

4296
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:27,850
Yeah, Dante's like...

4297
03:42:28,200 --> 03:42:29,160
so out of breath.

4298
03:42:34,840 --> 03:42:35,420
Zandatsu.

4299
03:42:36,580 --> 03:42:37,240
Thank you, Nero.

4300
03:42:43,910 --> 03:42:46,530
Yeah, because if Nero hadn't brought V...

4301
03:42:47,750 --> 03:42:49,110
He would've just died.

4302
03:42:51,710 --> 03:42:52,690
He would've just died.

4303
03:42:52,690 --> 03:42:52,930
He would've just died.

4304
03:42:53,690 --> 03:42:54,450
What happened to V?

4305
03:42:55,590 --> 03:42:55,970
Um...

4306
03:42:55,970 --> 03:42:56,490
He returned.

4307
03:42:58,050 --> 03:42:58,810
To himself.

4308
03:43:00,450 --> 03:43:00,830
Oh my god.

4309
03:43:00,830 --> 03:43:01,250
Go home, Nero.

4310
03:43:01,610 --> 03:43:02,910
This doesn't concern you.

4311
03:43:03,350 --> 03:43:04,010
Like hell.

4312
03:43:04,110 --> 03:43:05,070
Oh, I think it does, yeah.

4313
03:43:05,190 --> 03:43:06,430
I lost my right arm because of him.

4314
03:43:06,490 --> 03:43:07,470
This is not your fight.

4315
03:43:07,910 --> 03:43:09,870
I need to stop him and that's all that matters.

4316
03:43:10,090 --> 03:43:11,950
I'm not gonna let you have all the fun, Dante.

4317
03:43:12,490 --> 03:43:13,510
You don't get it.

4318
03:43:13,970 --> 03:43:14,810
Let me guess.

4319
03:43:14,810 --> 03:43:15,650
I'm dead weight.

4320
03:43:16,170 --> 03:43:16,950
That's not it.

4321
03:43:17,050 --> 03:43:17,830
What is this?

4322
03:43:18,010 --> 03:43:18,510
He's your father.

4323
03:43:29,270 --> 03:43:29,650
Luke.

4324
03:43:30,490 --> 03:43:33,230
I had the feeling the first time I saw you, but I just wasn't sure.

4325
03:43:36,230 --> 03:43:37,950
And then I saw how the Yamato reacted.

4326
03:43:39,990 --> 03:43:40,930
And I was certain.

4327
03:43:42,570 --> 03:43:43,350
He's your father.

4328
03:43:49,950 --> 03:43:51,190
Now he needs an ass kicking.

4329
03:43:53,430 --> 03:43:55,130
But I can't have you go kill your old man.

4330
03:43:55,230 --> 03:43:56,170
Aww.

4331
03:43:59,130 --> 03:43:59,970
What is this?

4332
03:44:00,030 --> 03:44:00,570
Metal Gear?

4333
03:44:01,930 --> 03:44:03,170
Sons killing fathers?

4334
03:44:05,070 --> 03:44:06,010
My father.

4335
03:44:07,250 --> 03:44:08,210
Unless...

4336
03:44:16,780 --> 03:44:17,580
Woah!

4337
03:44:18,340 --> 03:44:18,520
Woah!

4338
03:44:18,940 --> 03:44:20,140
Now it's in space!

4339
03:44:22,680 --> 03:44:23,160
Woah!

4340
03:44:23,920 --> 03:44:27,040
The world's biggest dandelion in space.

4341
03:44:27,660 --> 03:44:28,320
Wow!

4342
03:44:28,320 --> 03:44:28,500
Damn!

4343
03:44:31,620 --> 03:44:33,480
That day...

4344
03:44:33,480 --> 03:44:35,700
If our positions were switched...

4345
03:44:36,740 --> 03:44:37,800
Would our...

4346
03:44:38,040 --> 03:44:38,540
Fates...

4347
03:44:38,540 --> 03:44:40,100
Be different.

4348
03:44:40,700 --> 03:44:41,920
Who is the mob?

4349
03:44:42,840 --> 03:44:44,760
Would I have your life...

4350
03:44:45,040 --> 03:44:46,100
And you mine?

4351
03:44:47,440 --> 03:44:47,820
No, no,

4352
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:54,600
no.

4353
03:44:55,120 --> 03:44:56,540
Let's settle this...

4354
03:44:58,880 --> 03:44:59,380
Dante...

4355
03:45:02,380 --> 03:45:03,460
What's the chair?

4356
03:45:03,880 --> 03:45:03,940
Huh?

4357
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:05,900
Why are you guys all saying the chair?

4358
03:45:07,360 --> 03:45:07,700
What...

4359
03:45:08,380 --> 03:45:09,260
What's happening now?

4360
03:45:09,400 --> 03:45:09,860
Oh god.

4361
03:45:10,140 --> 03:45:11,260
I thought it was over.

4362
03:45:11,560 --> 03:45:12,420
This isn't good.

4363
03:45:13,420 --> 03:45:14,740
What are you guys talking about?

4364
03:45:15,160 --> 03:45:16,020
It's a meme?

4365
03:45:16,020 --> 03:45:16,960
Oh...

4366
03:45:23,460 --> 03:45:24,360
She doesn't know!

4367
03:45:24,500 --> 03:45:25,840
I've never played this game before!

4368
03:45:36,240 --> 03:45:38,740
Have you not seen the meme?

4369
03:45:38,960 --> 03:45:39,240
No!

4370
03:45:39,520 --> 03:45:39,960
Cause I...

4371
03:45:39,960 --> 03:45:42,080
Have not seen anything about this game before!

4372
03:45:44,080 --> 03:45:46,460
Well, now you guys are just making me feel bad.

4373
03:45:50,380 --> 03:45:50,900
Okay...

4374
03:45:50,900 --> 03:45:52,320
Kalina Ann too.

4375
03:45:52,500 --> 03:45:52,840
Let's go!

4376
03:45:54,660 --> 03:45:55,180
Oh!

4377
03:45:55,340 --> 03:45:56,420
Double Kalina Ann!

4378
03:45:56,540 --> 03:45:56,980
Let's go!

4379
03:46:02,760 --> 03:46:03,800
Okie dokie...

4380
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:05,520
Um...

4381
03:46:06,080 --> 03:46:07,520
Is there anything I wanna buy?

4382
03:46:09,460 --> 03:46:09,980
I...

4383
03:46:16,590 --> 03:46:17,110
Wait...

4384
03:46:18,990 --> 03:46:19,510
Cascade...

4385
03:46:19,510 --> 03:46:23,090
Connect the twin Kalina Ann's to fire a supercharged energy beam.

4386
03:46:23,410 --> 03:46:23,590
Whoa!

4387
03:46:24,210 --> 03:46:24,950
Hold the X.

4388
03:46:25,490 --> 03:46:26,870
Then release when they're together.

4389
03:46:29,450 --> 03:46:29,970
Okay...

4390
03:46:29,970 --> 03:46:31,910
Mod that makes his chair a plastic chair.

4391
03:46:32,130 --> 03:46:33,890
It became more popular than the real thing.

4392
03:46:34,550 --> 03:46:35,650
Ah, I see.

4393
03:46:36,090 --> 03:46:37,670
Well, how was I supposed to know?

4394
03:46:39,310 --> 03:46:42,990
How was I supposed to know to add a mod to a game that I've never played before?

4395
03:46:52,260 --> 03:46:54,320
Virgil has more Riz than Dante?

4396
03:46:55,280 --> 03:46:55,800
Um...

4397
03:46:55,800 --> 03:46:57,920
No, I think Dante just knows how to use protection.

4398
03:46:58,740 --> 03:46:59,940
That's what I think.

4399
03:47:02,480 --> 03:47:03,000
Dante...

4400
03:47:03,000 --> 03:47:05,040
Dante doesn't have children because he's safe.

4401
03:47:06,840 --> 03:47:08,040
And Virgil...

4402
03:47:09,200 --> 03:47:11,260
Virgil just doesn't have any...

4403
03:47:11,260 --> 03:47:12,600
Virgil will just leave you!

4404
03:47:13,420 --> 03:47:14,780
Dante has morals!

4405
03:47:23,320 --> 03:47:24,680
That's what I think!

4406
03:47:28,660 --> 03:47:29,260
Ok...

4407
03:47:29,260 --> 03:47:29,680
Um...

4408
03:47:29,680 --> 03:47:30,320
I don't think we need...

4409
03:47:30,320 --> 03:47:31,180
I think I understand...

4410
03:47:31,180 --> 03:47:33,120
We can at least see what it looks like.

4411
03:47:38,840 --> 03:47:39,900
This one.

4412
03:47:40,180 --> 03:47:42,640
Hold X together...

4413
03:47:44,400 --> 03:47:45,180
Get em girl!

4414
03:47:45,880 --> 03:47:46,800
Get em girl!

4415
03:47:48,900 --> 03:47:50,300
Oh my god!

4416
03:47:51,840 --> 03:47:52,720
Get em girl!

4417
03:47:55,840 --> 03:47:57,160
I like it.

4418
03:47:58,660 --> 03:47:59,580
Get em girl!

4419
03:48:11,380 --> 03:48:12,640
Try it on Gunslinger?

4420
03:48:12,740 --> 03:48:13,300
Oh, I forgot.

4421
03:48:13,680 --> 03:48:14,000
You're right.

4422
03:48:18,060 --> 03:48:18,960
Oh, there we go.

4423
03:48:22,040 --> 03:48:23,840
Wait, did I do that or...

4424
03:48:23,840 --> 03:48:24,620
Oh, okay, okay.

4425
03:48:36,100 --> 03:48:37,680
Oh, I was gonna say, where'd he go?

4426
03:48:38,920 --> 03:48:40,400
Dead weight and dead beat.

4427
03:48:41,640 --> 03:48:45,280
Like father, like son, unfortunately.

4428
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:50,980
All right, I think I'm just gonna go into it for now.

4429
03:48:54,820 --> 03:48:58,020
Actually, because I used King Cerberus in the last thing...

4430
03:48:58,020 --> 03:48:58,960
Let's see what else we got here.

4431
03:48:59,480 --> 03:49:01,140
On the ground, are we back?

4432
03:49:01,340 --> 03:49:01,500
Why?

4433
03:49:02,740 --> 03:49:04,260
Ah, what's this one again?

4434
03:49:04,440 --> 03:49:04,580
Okay.

4435
03:49:06,300 --> 03:49:07,240
Ice Age.

4436
03:49:08,290 --> 03:49:09,160
Back to forward.

4437
03:49:09,840 --> 03:49:10,900
Long Revolver.

4438
03:49:11,100 --> 03:49:12,580
Hold Y until electrified.

4439
03:49:13,500 --> 03:49:15,220
Hold Y until electrified.

4440
03:49:16,860 --> 03:49:18,680
Let's get Revolver at least.

4441
03:49:19,540 --> 03:49:21,560
Oh, I can do more Revolver!

4442
03:49:23,760 --> 03:49:26,000
Longer distance and more violent spin.

4443
03:49:27,660 --> 03:49:28,840
I like it.

4444
03:49:31,520 --> 03:49:32,020
Revolver.

4445
03:49:32,020 --> 03:49:32,100
Revolver.

4446
03:49:35,700 --> 03:49:36,200
Um...

4447
03:49:36,200 --> 03:49:39,240
I'll probably get Crystal too, just to have...

4448
03:49:39,240 --> 03:49:40,700
Yeah, I think it'll be good.

4449
03:49:41,200 --> 03:49:42,340
Okay, that's good for now.

4450
03:49:44,720 --> 03:49:45,680
Good for now.

4451
03:49:47,180 --> 03:49:48,080
Chew on this!

4452
03:49:48,080 --> 03:49:50,780
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4453
03:49:52,180 --> 03:49:52,760
Oh...

4454
03:49:54,860 --> 03:49:56,340
Morals over Riz.

4455
03:49:56,860 --> 03:49:57,620
That's what I'm saying.

4456
03:49:57,900 --> 03:49:58,840
Dante's a good guy.

4457
03:49:59,280 --> 03:50:01,440
I always like watching what they're doing in the little...

4458
03:50:01,440 --> 03:50:03,060
In the little menu...

4459
03:50:03,060 --> 03:50:04,260
Mission menus.

4460
03:50:05,400 --> 03:50:08,420
Like ladies always hanging out with Nico, it's so cute.

4461
03:50:10,680 --> 03:50:12,780
All right, three more!

4462
03:50:13,160 --> 03:50:14,240
We got this.

4463
03:50:25,280 --> 03:50:26,420
I forget though.

4464
03:50:26,640 --> 03:50:27,060
Wait, okay.

4465
03:50:28,260 --> 03:50:31,680
I think it's... you electrify it with...

4466
03:50:31,680 --> 03:50:31,960
Oh, oh.

4467
03:50:34,240 --> 03:50:34,800
Aw.

4468
03:50:41,650 --> 03:50:42,430
Time to go up.

4469
03:50:42,870 --> 03:50:44,730
Oh, oh, oh.

4470
03:50:45,870 --> 03:50:47,290
Oh, are these after me?

4471
03:50:47,430 --> 03:50:47,550
No?

4472
03:50:47,750 --> 03:50:47,890
Okay.

4473
03:50:49,170 --> 03:50:49,550
Oh!

4474
03:50:50,030 --> 03:50:52,030
It's these little bodies!

4475
03:50:55,270 --> 03:50:56,150
Are they...

4476
03:50:56,150 --> 03:50:57,150
Hey guys, where you been?

4477
03:50:57,470 --> 03:50:59,030
I thought you went back into Virgil.

4478
03:50:59,610 --> 03:51:01,010
Heh, you're gonna wish you did.

4479
03:51:01,370 --> 03:51:03,210
Oh, the wise guy Dante.

4480
03:51:03,770 --> 03:51:06,430
We were spawned from Virgil's abominable thoughts.

4481
03:51:07,350 --> 03:51:08,390
Truth howdy.

4482
03:51:09,330 --> 03:51:12,110
Come to think of it, I did know something was off.

4483
03:51:12,650 --> 03:51:14,170
Just like with my old brother.

4484
03:51:14,170 --> 03:51:18,910
Well, we're merely the discarded thoughts from when he was Neo Angelo.

4485
03:51:19,130 --> 03:51:21,130
No longer bound in his consciousness.

4486
03:51:21,530 --> 03:51:24,770
We're here now to kill you of our own free will.

4487
03:51:24,770 --> 03:51:26,790
I mean, you could join us too.

4488
03:51:27,270 --> 03:51:27,410
Oh.

4489
03:51:28,450 --> 03:51:29,380
Oh golly.

4490
03:51:30,140 --> 03:51:32,860
I wish I had never bought anything for you guys.

4491
03:51:36,940 --> 03:51:39,600
I wish I had never bought anything for you.

4492
03:51:42,700 --> 03:51:43,260
Oh.

4493
03:51:47,680 --> 03:51:48,240
Ouch.

4494
03:51:48,480 --> 03:51:48,860
Oh my god.

4495
03:51:49,420 --> 03:51:50,140
Oh my god.

4496
03:51:50,520 --> 03:51:51,040
Oh my god.

4497
03:51:52,780 --> 03:51:53,080
Wait.

4498
03:51:53,220 --> 03:51:53,480
Come here.

4499
03:51:53,720 --> 03:51:54,320
Come here, bird.

4500
03:51:54,820 --> 03:51:55,120
Wait.

4501
03:51:55,240 --> 03:51:55,780
Why am I...

4502
03:51:55,780 --> 03:51:55,920
Huh?

4503
03:51:56,800 --> 03:51:57,100
Wait.

4504
03:51:57,280 --> 03:51:57,720
What the heck?

4505
03:51:59,380 --> 03:51:59,680
Wait.

4506
03:51:59,880 --> 03:52:00,340
My weapon.

4507
03:52:00,720 --> 03:52:01,440
Oh, there we go.

4508
03:52:01,560 --> 03:52:01,820
Finally.

4509
03:52:12,700 --> 03:52:14,080
Come here.

4510
03:52:18,810 --> 03:52:20,170
Come here.

4511
03:52:28,050 --> 03:52:29,190
Come here.

4512
03:52:29,950 --> 03:52:31,090
Ouchie, ouch!

4513
03:52:34,690 --> 03:52:36,870
Come on, come here.

4514
03:52:41,870 --> 03:52:45,970
Do I just kind of keep destroying this thing?

4515
03:52:51,450 --> 03:52:53,270
Why are you just getting started?

4516
03:52:54,930 --> 03:52:56,070
Oh my god.

4517
03:52:58,270 --> 03:53:00,210
You little wimp.

4518
03:53:01,250 --> 03:53:02,730
Can't wait for the rematch.

4519
03:53:03,830 --> 03:53:05,290
What a little wiener.

4520
03:53:05,590 --> 03:53:06,710
Weenie, weenie.

4521
03:53:07,010 --> 03:53:08,150
What a little weenie.

4522
03:53:09,450 --> 03:53:10,910
All of them weenies.

4523
03:53:12,130 --> 03:53:13,590
Oh my gosh, where'd you come from?

4524
03:53:32,230 --> 03:53:33,250
I missed it.

4525
03:53:40,100 --> 03:53:41,300
Here's all I already did.

4526
03:53:48,590 --> 03:53:49,690
Give him the hat.

4527
03:53:49,930 --> 03:53:51,170
Oh yeah, let's switch to our hat.

4528
03:53:51,970 --> 03:53:53,510
Oh, one more time.

4529
03:53:55,970 --> 03:53:56,470
Nothing.

4530
03:53:57,570 --> 03:53:58,070
Stingy.

4531
03:53:59,570 --> 03:54:01,890
All of these summons are the bosses from DMC1.

4532
03:54:01,990 --> 03:54:04,250
Yeah, someone told me about that last time too.

4533
03:54:05,230 --> 03:54:07,690
Virgil thinks about birds, cats, and goop monsters.

4534
03:54:14,820 --> 03:54:15,320
Okay.

4535
03:54:17,540 --> 03:54:17,940
Enter.

4536
03:54:31,040 --> 03:54:35,160
I love goop, and cats, and bird monsters.

4537
03:54:38,190 --> 03:54:39,280
Oh, nice.

4538
03:54:39,680 --> 03:54:40,760
Almost missed that.

4539
03:54:41,840 --> 03:54:42,840
Let's go.

4540
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:44,800
Let's go, baby.

4541
03:54:45,840 --> 03:54:47,120
Let's go, baby.

4542
03:54:47,780 --> 03:54:48,380
Yeah, yeah.

4543
03:54:49,220 --> 03:54:51,690
Shape-shifting panthers, and...

4544
03:54:54,300 --> 03:54:55,040
Weeer.

4545
03:54:55,160 --> 03:54:55,800
Oh, oh, shadow.

4546
03:54:59,160 --> 03:55:00,940
Are you going to be able to fight properly?

4547
03:55:01,540 --> 03:55:03,040
Oh my gosh, he is.

4548
03:55:10,470 --> 03:55:13,170
Because you also couldn't ever fight so well.

4549
03:55:14,010 --> 03:55:14,730
Hey, oh.

4550
03:55:15,910 --> 03:55:17,250
Why is it so misty over here?

4551
03:55:17,450 --> 03:55:18,170
Looks like a barrier.

4552
03:55:20,870 --> 03:55:21,510
Get him.

4553
03:55:22,450 --> 03:55:23,970
Yeah, get the Zayas.

4554
03:55:24,170 --> 03:55:24,950
Oh, that's it?

4555
03:55:25,470 --> 03:55:26,250
Come on.

4556
03:55:29,090 --> 03:55:30,130
Come on.

4557
03:55:35,570 --> 03:55:37,090
Maybe it's, maybe it's not the...

4558
03:55:37,090 --> 03:55:37,810
Oh, that's me.

4559
03:55:38,150 --> 03:55:39,630
Maybe it's not the user, though.

4560
03:55:39,910 --> 03:55:41,410
Or maybe it is the user, I mean.

4561
03:55:57,890 --> 03:55:58,550
Oh, oh.

4562
03:56:06,480 --> 03:56:07,700
Hold on, I'm going to get the orb.

4563
03:56:10,320 --> 03:56:11,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

4564
03:56:16,700 --> 03:56:17,100
Damn.

4565
03:56:26,200 --> 03:56:28,340
Poor little shadow was being like...

4566
03:56:32,660 --> 03:56:33,860
Oh, hello.

4567
03:56:35,420 --> 03:56:36,020
Uh...

4568
03:56:36,020 --> 03:56:36,600
Wait.

4569
03:56:44,320 --> 03:56:45,900
I thought I heard another one.

4570
03:56:47,120 --> 03:56:47,500
No?

4571
03:56:48,600 --> 03:56:50,060
Uh, let's go...

4572
03:56:50,060 --> 03:56:50,200
Wait.

4573
03:56:50,880 --> 03:56:52,060
I do hear one.

4574
03:56:52,160 --> 03:56:53,060
Oh, he's up there.

4575
03:57:02,340 --> 03:57:04,620
I can't tell which way it wants me to go.

4576
03:57:04,800 --> 03:57:05,220
Oh.

4577
03:57:05,860 --> 03:57:06,960
I'll take those.

4578
03:57:11,680 --> 03:57:12,120
Wait.

4579
03:57:12,320 --> 03:57:14,540
Actually, let's, uh...

4580
03:57:14,540 --> 03:57:15,040
Do this.

4581
03:57:16,540 --> 03:57:17,420
Oh, no, no, no.

4582
03:57:17,640 --> 03:57:18,140
No, no.

4583
03:57:18,260 --> 03:57:18,820
Don't run away.

4584
03:57:19,240 --> 03:57:20,160
You're my money.

4585
03:57:20,560 --> 03:57:20,960
Wait.

4586
03:57:21,160 --> 03:57:21,420
Wait.

4587
03:57:21,700 --> 03:57:22,080
Wait.

4588
03:57:22,080 --> 03:57:22,280
Wait.

4589
03:57:22,380 --> 03:57:23,360
I'm trying to donut you.

4590
03:57:23,720 --> 03:57:24,940
I'm trying to donut you.

4591
03:57:35,950 --> 03:57:36,530
I'm...

4592
03:57:36,530 --> 03:57:38,090
I royally messed that up.

4593
03:57:38,170 --> 03:57:38,850
Wait, wait, wait.

4594
03:57:39,190 --> 03:57:39,490
Wait.

4595
03:57:42,390 --> 03:57:42,970
I...

4596
03:57:42,970 --> 03:57:43,260
I...

4597
03:57:43,770 --> 03:57:44,030
I...

4598
03:57:45,590 --> 03:57:48,490
I royally screwed that one up.

4599
03:57:50,350 --> 03:57:53,630
I was trying to get all three of them at once.

4600
03:57:53,790 --> 03:57:55,850
So that one wouldn't de-spine.

4601
03:57:56,330 --> 03:57:57,090
You know what it means?

4602
03:57:57,090 --> 03:57:58,230
Instead.

4603
03:58:01,330 --> 03:58:02,570
Oh, shucks.

4604
03:58:04,530 --> 03:58:06,450
You can't win them all, you guys.

4605
03:58:06,990 --> 03:58:07,470
Oh, okay.

4606
03:58:07,530 --> 03:58:08,410
That's all that was down here.

4607
03:58:08,790 --> 03:58:10,230
You can't win them all.

4608
03:58:11,250 --> 03:58:13,490
More like royal goop.

4609
03:58:19,250 --> 03:58:20,670
What have I grown?

4610
03:58:21,550 --> 03:58:22,630
What have I grown?

4611
03:58:23,750 --> 03:58:25,210
What'd you say about me?

4612
03:58:25,830 --> 03:58:26,370
Oh, sorry.

4613
03:58:26,370 --> 03:58:27,670
I'm on my mouse.

4614
03:58:27,910 --> 03:58:29,270
What'd you say about me?

4615
03:58:30,850 --> 03:58:33,950
You going full panic when you had to fight Shadow on DMC1.

4616
03:58:34,090 --> 03:58:34,810
Now look at you.

4617
03:58:37,090 --> 03:58:38,130
Big kitty.

4618
03:58:45,380 --> 03:58:47,120
It would help if I...

4619
03:58:47,760 --> 03:58:49,760
If I got close to it.

4620
03:58:52,400 --> 03:58:53,420
Where is that?

4621
03:59:03,610 --> 03:59:04,190
Oh.

4622
03:59:05,670 --> 03:59:06,250
Oops.

4623
03:59:06,690 --> 03:59:07,970
That doesn't sound good.

4624
03:59:08,970 --> 03:59:10,170
I'm sure it's fine.

4625
03:59:10,330 --> 03:59:11,310
Oh, you guys.

4626
03:59:16,810 --> 03:59:17,730
Come here.

4627
03:59:36,930 --> 03:59:37,910
You almost did.

4628
03:59:51,170 --> 03:59:52,170
Tilly's toast.

4629
03:59:53,130 --> 03:59:53,890
Very toast.

4630
03:59:58,690 --> 03:59:59,750
Oh, you're back.

4631
04:00:00,870 --> 04:00:00,950
Oh.

4632
04:00:06,750 --> 04:00:07,590
Hold on.

4633
04:00:09,030 --> 04:00:09,830
Hold on.

4634
04:00:10,110 --> 04:00:11,450
You would look great in this.

4635
04:00:13,810 --> 04:00:15,490
You would look great in that.

4636
04:00:16,750 --> 04:00:17,130
Yeah.

4637
04:00:17,850 --> 04:00:18,050
Yeah.

4638
04:00:21,670 --> 04:00:22,650
There's another one.

4639
04:00:25,750 --> 04:00:26,350
Game.

4640
04:00:26,650 --> 04:00:27,510
I'm lost.

4641
04:00:30,310 --> 04:00:30,750
I'm lost.

4642
04:00:30,750 --> 04:00:30,790
I'm lost.

4643
04:00:31,390 --> 04:00:31,830
Get him.

4644
04:00:32,790 --> 04:00:33,230
I'm...

4645
04:00:33,230 --> 04:00:34,270
No, what is auto?

4646
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:35,130
No, no, no.

4647
04:00:35,450 --> 04:00:35,990
What did I just do?

4648
04:00:36,470 --> 04:00:36,730
Game.

4649
04:00:37,250 --> 04:00:38,130
I'm lost.

4650
04:00:39,430 --> 04:00:40,290
Is it this way?

4651
04:00:40,650 --> 04:00:41,370
I gotta go up?

4652
04:00:43,970 --> 04:00:45,290
I hear them up there.

4653
04:00:50,760 --> 04:00:52,020
Here, here, here, here.

4654
04:00:52,020 --> 04:00:52,220
Come here.

4655
04:01:01,420 --> 04:01:02,180
Here, here, here.

4656
04:01:03,800 --> 04:01:04,980
A little hat.

4657
04:01:05,840 --> 04:01:06,240
No, no, no.

4658
04:01:06,400 --> 04:01:07,140
Don't, don't, don't you dare.

4659
04:01:07,340 --> 04:01:07,860
Don't you dare.

4660
04:01:08,080 --> 04:01:08,500
Don't you dare.

4661
04:01:08,700 --> 04:01:09,000
Come back.

4662
04:01:09,260 --> 04:01:09,660
Wait, come here.

4663
04:01:10,080 --> 04:01:10,780
Don't you leave.

4664
04:01:11,140 --> 04:01:11,720
You're my money.

4665
04:01:12,000 --> 04:01:12,940
You're my business venture.

4666
04:01:13,160 --> 04:01:13,920
I need you.

4667
04:01:14,640 --> 04:01:15,740
I need you.

4668
04:01:21,260 --> 04:01:22,140
Big money.

4669
04:01:22,480 --> 04:01:25,080
I think, I hope none of that dropped off the size.

4670
04:01:28,100 --> 04:01:29,460
I hope none of that.

4671
04:01:32,840 --> 04:01:34,680
And time for, what's his name?

4672
04:01:36,060 --> 04:01:37,920
Uh, big nightmare?

4673
04:01:39,800 --> 04:01:40,600
Is he here?

4674
04:01:40,800 --> 04:01:41,320
Oh, shadow.

4675
04:01:41,700 --> 04:01:41,800
Again?

4676
04:01:42,340 --> 04:01:42,760
Where are you?

4677
04:01:43,560 --> 04:01:44,280
Big kitty.

4678
04:01:44,900 --> 04:01:45,740
Big kitty.

4679
04:01:47,260 --> 04:01:47,780
Ouch.

4680
04:01:48,800 --> 04:01:49,740
That was rude.

4681
04:01:54,440 --> 04:01:55,180
Oh, wait.

4682
04:01:55,280 --> 04:01:55,700
You're here, too?

4683
04:01:56,140 --> 04:01:57,000
Where are you?

4684
04:01:57,460 --> 04:01:57,620
Oh.

4685
04:01:58,400 --> 04:01:59,200
Where's the bird?

4686
04:02:03,280 --> 04:02:04,380
Oh, there he is.

4687
04:02:05,340 --> 04:02:05,860
Ouch.

4688
04:02:07,240 --> 04:02:07,800
Ouch.

4689
04:02:11,760 --> 04:02:12,720
Not a bad line.

4690
04:02:13,460 --> 04:02:14,280
You're the same way.

4691
04:02:16,320 --> 04:02:16,880
Oh.

4692
04:02:31,300 --> 04:02:32,440
Two with one stone.

4693
04:02:34,920 --> 04:02:35,900
Oh, my God.

4694
04:02:36,740 --> 04:02:37,940
I forgot you had that move.

4695
04:02:38,040 --> 04:02:39,360
I don't think I ever bought it for you.

4696
04:02:39,620 --> 04:02:40,480
Where'd you learn that from?

4697
04:02:43,600 --> 04:02:44,960
Cat in the hat.

4698
04:02:50,480 --> 04:02:51,820
It's so funny looking.

4699
04:02:56,420 --> 04:02:56,960
Hey.

4700
04:02:57,460 --> 04:02:57,900
Woo.

4701
04:02:59,620 --> 04:03:00,820
Where did you learn that?

4702
04:03:01,960 --> 04:03:03,820
I never taught my kitty how to do that.

4703
04:03:04,440 --> 04:03:04,520
Oh.

4704
04:03:06,340 --> 04:03:06,880
Nice.

4705
04:03:35,630 --> 04:03:38,170
There's a manga covering Virgil's story?

4706
04:03:38,510 --> 04:03:38,950
Really?

4707
04:03:43,830 --> 04:03:45,530
Let's focus on Cat.

4708
04:03:50,510 --> 04:03:51,210
Oh, only Cat.

4709
04:03:52,470 --> 04:03:52,550
Oh.

4710
04:03:52,970 --> 04:03:53,930
Only Cat.

4711
04:03:55,350 --> 04:03:56,810
Check out Vision of V.

4712
04:03:57,330 --> 04:03:58,150
One more round.

4713
04:03:58,470 --> 04:04:00,190
Looks like I'm back on Malay Island.

4714
04:04:00,710 --> 04:04:01,970
Malay, Malay.

4715
04:04:02,170 --> 04:04:02,910
Malay, Malay.

4716
04:04:03,070 --> 04:04:03,850
Malay, Malay.

4717
04:04:04,790 --> 04:04:05,430
Malay.

4718
04:04:05,430 --> 04:04:05,990
Malay the island.

4719
04:04:07,930 --> 04:04:08,910
Oh, nice.

4720
04:04:10,990 --> 04:04:12,450
Punch the Cat in the face.

4721
04:04:12,450 --> 04:04:13,330
Yeah, pretty much.

4722
04:04:14,490 --> 04:04:15,190
Actually, no.

4723
04:04:15,330 --> 04:04:16,750
I nunchucked the Cat in the face.

4724
04:04:17,390 --> 04:04:18,070
Big difference.

4725
04:04:19,650 --> 04:04:20,070
Whoa.

4726
04:04:20,310 --> 04:04:21,290
I almost missed.

4727
04:04:22,690 --> 04:04:24,970
It pays to be observant.

4728
04:04:25,570 --> 04:04:25,970
Right, Dante?

4729
04:04:28,030 --> 04:04:31,950
I guess also putting a little hat on and doesn't do anything since...

4730
04:04:33,250 --> 04:04:35,130
They're not technically dying right now.

4731
04:04:42,680 --> 04:04:43,880
Do you remember the island?

4732
04:04:44,080 --> 04:04:44,340
Put the one

4733
04:04:47,730 --> 04:04:48,010
in...

4734
04:04:48,010 --> 04:04:48,230
Oh.

4735
04:04:48,230 --> 04:04:49,650
They know they don't stand a chance.

4736
04:04:50,350 --> 04:04:52,130
Are they trying to atone for something?

4737
04:04:55,610 --> 04:04:56,030
Oh.

4738
04:04:58,470 --> 04:04:59,150
Take it.

4739
04:04:59,470 --> 04:05:00,030
You know what?

4740
04:05:00,110 --> 04:05:00,670
Why not?

4741
04:05:05,280 --> 04:05:09,100
How have I seen so many playthroughs of this game and never come across a cat in the hatch?

4742
04:05:17,000 --> 04:05:18,820
I'm going to charge my...

4743
04:05:19,440 --> 04:05:20,500
Charge my...

4744
04:05:21,660 --> 04:05:22,300
Okay.

4745
04:05:22,540 --> 04:05:24,200
We're going to charge before we...

4746
04:05:24,200 --> 04:05:26,000
Before we fight the nightmare.

4747
04:05:27,020 --> 04:05:28,280
Oh, come on.

4748
04:05:29,060 --> 04:05:30,000
It's so low.

4749
04:05:31,420 --> 04:05:33,080
They're like, hey, remember his cane?

4750
04:05:33,500 --> 04:05:34,820
He's gone now.

4751
04:05:35,060 --> 04:05:36,260
You'll never see him again.

4752
04:05:47,530 --> 04:05:48,930
This guy was also...

4753
04:05:48,930 --> 04:05:49,730
A jerk!

4754
04:05:51,230 --> 04:05:51,990
You know what?

4755
04:05:52,150 --> 04:05:53,830
I don't feel like dealing with you guys.

4756
04:06:00,170 --> 04:06:02,510
I don't feel like dealing with you guys right now.

4757
04:06:03,650 --> 04:06:04,090
Oh,

4758
04:06:14,560 --> 04:06:14,580
shoot.

4759
04:06:14,840 --> 04:06:15,460
I lost it.

4760
04:06:15,620 --> 04:06:15,800
Ouch!

4761
04:06:17,060 --> 04:06:17,400
Wait.

4762
04:06:17,700 --> 04:06:17,820
Oh.

4763
04:06:19,360 --> 04:06:21,220
You had me in your little claws!

4764
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:21,880
And you...

4765
04:06:21,880 --> 04:06:24,560
Pull three of them at once is kind of...

4766
04:06:25,200 --> 04:06:25,560
Oh.

4767
04:06:27,500 --> 04:06:27,940
Wait.

4768
04:06:28,100 --> 04:06:28,660
What if I...

4769
04:06:34,140 --> 04:06:34,920
How was it?

4770
04:06:37,740 --> 04:06:39,460
It was like, hold down X, no?

4771
04:06:45,820 --> 04:06:47,240
Oh, and Gunslinger.

4772
04:06:48,900 --> 04:06:49,440
Oh.

4773
04:06:55,680 --> 04:06:57,440
You're just tapping me a lot.

4774
04:06:58,220 --> 04:06:59,260
Let's try it.

4775
04:07:01,080 --> 04:07:01,620
Oh.

4776
04:07:07,890 --> 04:07:09,690
Oh, I had to buy it.

4777
04:07:09,850 --> 04:07:09,990
Oh.

4778
04:07:10,250 --> 04:07:10,870
I don't remember.

4779
04:07:12,190 --> 04:07:12,950
Be honest.

4780
04:07:13,130 --> 04:07:13,650
I don't remember.

4781
04:07:13,810 --> 04:07:13,910
Oh.

4782
04:07:18,270 --> 04:07:19,050
Stupid bird.

4783
04:07:20,130 --> 04:07:22,130
Why is their health not going down at all, though?

4784
04:07:22,850 --> 04:07:23,670
Oh my god.

4785
04:07:23,830 --> 04:07:24,230
Oh my god.

4786
04:07:24,410 --> 04:07:24,710
Oh my god.

4787
04:07:28,890 --> 04:07:29,810
Oh my god.

4788
04:07:34,210 --> 04:07:36,270
Oh, is it just him that I have to...

4789
04:07:36,270 --> 04:07:37,650
Nightmare's the main body.

4790
04:07:38,510 --> 04:07:39,290
I see.

4791
04:07:40,530 --> 04:07:40,930
Okay.

4792
04:07:41,570 --> 04:07:42,090
What is he?

4793
04:07:42,250 --> 04:07:42,390
Oh.

4794
04:07:42,390 --> 04:07:42,990
Ouch.

4795
04:07:45,150 --> 04:07:46,270
Oh, I'm scared.

4796
04:07:46,410 --> 04:07:47,190
What's he gonna do?

4797
04:07:51,730 --> 04:07:52,370
Ow!

4798
04:07:52,530 --> 04:07:52,950
That's me!

4799
04:07:56,310 --> 04:07:57,790
Oh, he's spinning.

4800
04:07:58,170 --> 04:07:59,530
Oh, he's spinning.

4801
04:08:00,110 --> 04:08:00,510
Oh, he's spinning.

4802
04:08:03,900 --> 04:08:04,540
Oh,

4803
04:08:15,420 --> 04:08:15,920
come on!

4804
04:08:16,320 --> 04:08:18,300
I was in front of you.

4805
04:08:18,400 --> 04:08:19,200
How did that hit?

4806
04:08:20,500 --> 04:08:21,140
Oh.

4807
04:08:40,910 --> 04:08:41,550
Ow!

4808
04:08:41,550 --> 04:08:43,490
I missed it again.

4809
04:08:48,120 --> 04:08:48,700
Woo-wee.

4810
04:08:49,180 --> 04:08:49,440
Woo!

4811
04:08:49,700 --> 04:08:49,900
No!

4812
04:08:50,360 --> 04:08:52,160
Okay, I need to just DT normal.

4813
04:08:54,960 --> 04:08:56,440
I need to just DT normal.

4814
04:08:56,880 --> 04:08:57,020
I need to just DT normal.

4815
04:09:06,930 --> 04:09:08,150
Input's a little wonky.

4816
04:09:08,450 --> 04:09:11,850
Sometimes I would press it, and it really didn't do it.

4817
04:09:13,530 --> 04:09:18,810
I need tosemlle is G-w as he что- Noooo!

4818
04:09:22,670 --> 04:09:24,090
Woo, that gave some blobs.

4819
04:09:24,350 --> 04:09:24,990
I'll take that.

4820
04:09:27,810 --> 04:09:28,250
Freeze!

4821
04:09:29,070 --> 04:09:29,190
Freeze!

4822
04:09:29,190 --> 04:09:29,350
Fience!

4823
04:09:29,570 --> 04:09:29,790
Yeah!

4824
04:09:30,610 --> 04:09:31,350
Yeah, freeze!

4825
04:09:31,750 --> 04:09:32,790
Oh, wait, get the...

4826
04:09:32,790 --> 04:09:33,170
get the...

4827
04:09:33,170 --> 04:09:33,570
Get the...

4828
04:09:33,570 --> 04:09:33,870
Get the...

4829
04:09:33,870 --> 04:09:33,910
Get the...

4830
04:09:33,910 --> 04:09:34,050
Get them!

4831
04:09:47,370 --> 04:09:47,810
Get them!

4832
04:09:56,520 --> 04:09:58,220
Here he comes.

4833
04:10:02,120 --> 04:10:03,280
Wait, the cat's back!

4834
04:10:03,840 --> 04:10:04,560
Oh gosh.

4835
04:10:09,540 --> 04:10:11,740
Where'd he go?

4836
04:10:11,980 --> 04:10:12,660
Where'd he go?

4837
04:10:13,320 --> 04:10:14,140
Oh, there he is.

4838
04:10:15,700 --> 04:10:16,380
Don't do it.

4839
04:10:19,460 --> 04:10:21,540
What a waste of my DT, you mister!

4840
04:10:24,320 --> 04:10:25,980
You made me waste my DT!

4841
04:10:40,280 --> 04:10:43,020
I'm gonna switch back to my dungeon.

4842
04:10:43,480 --> 04:10:44,600
Oh my gosh!

4843
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:46,120
Get up, get up!

4844
04:10:50,740 --> 04:10:52,480
As soon as I started, he was in it.

4845
04:10:52,680 --> 04:10:53,440
Oh, he's gone!

4846
04:10:53,540 --> 04:10:53,960
Seriously?

4847
04:10:55,040 --> 04:10:56,580
Oh wait, he's right there.

4848
04:10:57,180 --> 04:10:58,420
Get his butt, get his butt!

4849
04:11:00,180 --> 04:11:00,700
Yeah!

4850
04:11:05,000 --> 04:11:06,480
He became orbed!

4851
04:11:08,400 --> 04:11:09,440
Get orbed!

4852
04:11:10,660 --> 04:11:12,000
You should've known better.

4853
04:11:12,600 --> 04:11:16,040
You got a good heart, but you're about as sharp as a marble.

4854
04:11:16,580 --> 04:11:17,000
Oh, dang.

4855
04:11:17,740 --> 04:11:17,740
Perhaps.

4856
04:11:19,020 --> 04:11:23,160
But if you had even a little bit of trouble defeating us...

4857
04:11:23,160 --> 04:11:23,540
No!

4858
04:11:25,120 --> 04:11:25,660
None!

4859
04:11:27,640 --> 04:11:28,180
None!

4860
04:11:32,240 --> 04:11:33,360
No trouble!

4861
04:11:35,520 --> 04:11:36,620
No trouble!

4862
04:11:37,960 --> 04:11:40,260
I can see you guys commenting that on my...

4863
04:11:41,120 --> 04:11:43,380
Saying, you're about as sharp as a marble.

4864
04:11:45,600 --> 04:11:47,020
Rest in peace, little chicken.

4865
04:11:48,260 --> 04:11:50,200
Aw, fried chicken on the menu.

4866
04:11:54,080 --> 04:11:55,280
Don't 07 him.

4867
04:11:55,420 --> 04:11:55,920
He sucked.

4868
04:11:58,940 --> 04:12:00,800
I'm sti- I'm not over the betrayal.

4869
04:12:01,100 --> 04:12:02,440
I'm still upset about it.

4870
04:12:12,200 --> 04:12:14,140
Oh my god, Niko!

4871
04:12:15,680 --> 04:12:18,080
I don't know if that's better or worse!

4872
04:12:26,940 --> 04:12:27,580
Where's Dante?

4873
04:12:27,960 --> 04:12:28,640
He's got this!

4874
04:12:28,820 --> 04:12:29,860
We gotta go, now!

4875
04:12:30,400 --> 04:12:32,900
So this guy Virgil, you know him?

4876
04:12:33,200 --> 04:12:33,660
Vaguely.

4877
04:12:34,200 --> 04:12:34,200
Yes.

4878
04:12:38,600 --> 04:12:40,460
Dante said that guy's my father.

4879
04:12:40,940 --> 04:12:42,440
What the hell's going on, Trish?

4880
04:12:42,580 --> 04:12:43,740
His logic is sound.

4881
04:12:44,220 --> 04:12:45,400
I had a hunch myself.

4882
04:12:45,640 --> 04:12:45,780
What?

4883
04:12:45,780 --> 04:12:47,940
This doesn't make any sense!

4884
04:12:48,200 --> 04:12:49,920
It's the Griffin's voice actor who passed away in 2020.

4885
04:12:49,940 --> 04:12:52,540
I know you're a virgin, but you can't kill your own father!

4886
04:12:54,120 --> 04:12:54,800
It's true.

4887
04:12:56,440 --> 04:12:57,940
You'd never recover from that.

4888
04:12:58,220 --> 04:12:58,980
She would know.

4889
04:12:59,640 --> 04:13:00,420
Lady would know.

4890
04:13:00,420 --> 04:13:00,880
You saved us.

4891
04:13:00,960 --> 04:13:01,720
You should be proud.

4892
04:13:02,180 --> 04:13:03,920
Now you can put all this behind me.

4893
04:13:04,080 --> 04:13:04,880
Niko, stop the car!

4894
04:13:05,040 --> 04:13:05,760
No chance!

4895
04:13:06,080 --> 04:13:07,880
After all this, are you insane?

4896
04:13:09,680 --> 04:13:10,120
Lady...

4897
04:13:10,120 --> 04:13:11,120
Oh, lady!

4898
04:13:11,340 --> 04:13:12,180
Gosh, she's so beautiful.

4899
04:13:12,440 --> 04:13:12,440
Fine.

4900
04:13:12,820 --> 04:13:13,820
I'll go by myself.

4901
04:13:29,000 --> 04:13:30,420
I'm gonna have to fight...

4902
04:13:30,420 --> 04:13:32,160
I'm gonna have to kill him as Nero, huh?

4903
04:13:38,680 --> 04:13:42,720
Also, why would she stop the car when the whole place is literally collapsing?

4904
04:13:44,900 --> 04:13:46,500
He's about as sharp as a marble.

4905
04:13:49,900 --> 04:13:50,980
Oh, no.

4906
04:13:51,440 --> 04:13:52,000
Oh, no.

4907
04:13:52,220 --> 04:13:53,740
Mission 19 is Dante.

4908
04:13:54,080 --> 04:13:56,420
Which means mission 20 is gonna be Nero!

4909
04:14:06,050 --> 04:14:06,590
No!

4910
04:14:16,680 --> 04:14:17,640
Oh, man.

4911
04:14:19,860 --> 04:14:25,460
I really don't know if there's anything else I could get that would make a difference for me.

4912
04:14:27,820 --> 04:14:28,620
I don't know.

4913
04:14:28,780 --> 04:14:29,900
Wait, it was this one.

4914
04:14:30,080 --> 04:14:30,680
That's right.

4915
04:14:32,900 --> 04:14:36,260
Would it even... would it even...

4916
04:14:38,080 --> 04:14:39,700
I don't know if I already bought the last one.

4917
04:14:39,760 --> 04:14:41,000
I bought all that I could.

4918
04:14:44,520 --> 04:14:44,960
Huh...

4919
04:14:44,960 --> 04:14:46,480
Nero is Johnny Young Vash.

4920
04:14:46,560 --> 04:14:46,760
Yeah!

4921
04:14:52,270 --> 04:14:54,530
I barely even used Trickster, guys.

4922
04:14:54,610 --> 04:14:55,310
I don't think it would.

4923
04:14:55,810 --> 04:14:57,290
I'm not gonna start now.

4924
04:14:59,690 --> 04:15:03,550
I don't know if I'll start now if I don't use it before.

4925
04:15:06,550 --> 04:15:11,670
If I... if I... I mean, I have the money, though.

4926
04:15:14,630 --> 04:15:17,750
I think everybody who's telling me to use Royal Guard...

4927
04:15:19,710 --> 04:15:21,430
...haven't watched me before.

4928
04:15:24,610 --> 04:15:28,750
I think everybody who's telling me to use Royal Guard...

4929
04:15:29,550 --> 04:15:31,430
...haven't watched me before.

4930
04:15:35,980 --> 04:15:37,760
Just play as you always have.

4931
04:15:38,280 --> 04:15:39,420
I guess that's true.

4932
04:15:39,580 --> 04:15:39,680
Yeah.

4933
04:15:40,140 --> 04:15:40,780
You know what?

4934
04:15:40,780 --> 04:15:43,680
That's... I've gotten through it before.

4935
04:15:44,000 --> 04:15:44,980
I've withered by...

4936
04:15:46,400 --> 04:15:47,100
...sheer...

4937
04:15:49,280 --> 04:15:49,980
...determination...

4938
04:15:51,220 --> 04:15:51,920
...uh...

4939
04:15:52,620 --> 04:15:53,320
...uh...

4940
04:15:53,760 --> 04:15:54,200
...uh...

4941
04:15:54,200 --> 04:15:55,080
...and...

4942
04:15:56,500 --> 04:15:57,900
...determination...

4943
04:15:57,900 --> 04:15:59,860
...frustration...

4944
04:15:59,860 --> 04:16:02,140
...motivation...

4945
04:16:03,520 --> 04:16:04,000
...hahaha...

4946
04:16:04,000 --> 04:16:04,640
...and money.

4947
04:16:04,860 --> 04:16:05,280
Oh no!

4948
04:16:05,520 --> 04:16:06,520
I haven't spent money.

4949
04:16:06,660 --> 04:16:07,500
I spent gorbs.

4950
04:16:07,600 --> 04:16:08,180
And that's different.

4951
04:16:08,780 --> 04:16:10,680
Because those... have all been free.

4952
04:16:14,000 --> 04:16:14,480
Gorbs...

4953
04:16:14,480 --> 04:16:15,340
...are free.

4954
04:16:17,620 --> 04:16:19,820
I collected those myself.

4955
04:16:25,380 --> 04:16:26,240
And yogurt.

4956
04:16:27,120 --> 04:16:27,480
Yogurt!

4957
04:16:27,780 --> 04:16:28,360
Oh my gosh.

4958
04:16:28,540 --> 04:16:29,480
I don't know if I'll make it.

4959
04:16:29,600 --> 04:16:30,660
I'm not gonna lie.

4960
04:16:33,060 --> 04:16:35,020
I don't know if I'll make it for yogurt time.

4961
04:16:35,320 --> 04:16:36,760
Since I have two missions left.

4962
04:16:38,140 --> 04:16:38,880
But we'll see.

4963
04:16:41,100 --> 04:16:42,040
We'll see, we'll see.

4964
04:16:42,460 --> 04:16:43,440
I'm just gonna go in.

4965
04:16:43,560 --> 04:16:45,320
Let's just go in then and see what happens.

4966
04:16:47,860 --> 04:16:48,940
Get motivated.

4967
04:16:49,880 --> 04:16:51,440
Get motivated!

4968
04:16:52,360 --> 04:16:56,880
Do you guys remember that from... Ajumanga Daioh but it was in the dub.

4969
04:16:57,740 --> 04:16:59,820
And Chio-chan is like, get motivated!

4970
04:17:01,800 --> 04:17:02,680
Get motivated!

4971
04:17:02,920 --> 04:17:03,280
Get motivated!

4972
04:17:03,500 --> 04:17:03,980
Get motivated!

4973
04:17:04,260 --> 04:17:04,600
Get motivated!

4974
04:17:05,580 --> 04:17:07,780
Get motivated!

4975
04:17:08,220 --> 04:17:13,300
Oh so in the... in the mod, he would be sitting in a plastic chair?

4976
04:17:21,760 --> 04:17:24,420
Should I... Should I... Wait.

4977
04:17:24,900 --> 04:17:25,680
Oh, shoot.

4978
04:17:25,880 --> 04:17:26,660
I just quit.

4979
04:17:26,760 --> 04:17:27,020
Hold on.

4980
04:17:27,420 --> 04:17:27,600
Wait.

4981
04:17:28,640 --> 04:17:31,100
Should I... Should I quit and install the mod?

4982
04:17:38,160 --> 04:17:38,600
No?

4983
04:17:39,000 --> 04:17:40,460
Okay, then let me read... Let me redo.

4984
04:17:41,260 --> 04:17:44,600
Since I actually quit... I tried to pause it and I actually quit the cutscene.

4985
04:17:46,440 --> 04:17:46,880
Okay.

4986
04:17:49,080 --> 04:17:50,340
Not a good use of time.

4987
04:17:50,460 --> 04:17:50,800
Yeah, guys!

4988
04:17:50,900 --> 04:17:51,640
We're on a time limit!

4989
04:17:53,200 --> 04:17:53,640
True.

4990
04:17:54,640 --> 04:17:55,880
I'll just look it up later.

4991
04:18:09,780 --> 04:18:16,800
If you want... Then you'll have to take it.

4992
04:18:16,800 --> 04:18:18,080
But you already knew that.

4993
04:18:18,280 --> 04:18:19,180
Yeah, I know.

4994
04:18:19,540 --> 04:18:20,780
I had a feeling you'd say that.

4995
04:18:21,020 --> 04:18:21,360
Yeah.

4996
04:18:21,700 --> 04:18:22,080
Gosh.

4997
04:18:22,320 --> 04:18:24,020
Virgil aged so gracefully.

4998
04:18:24,640 --> 04:18:26,860
How many times have we fought?

4999
04:18:27,540 --> 04:18:30,420
If turning... If separating your humanity...

5000
04:18:30,420 --> 04:18:30,420
Hard to say.

5001
04:18:30,720 --> 04:18:32,780
It's the only memory I have of us since we were kids.

5002
04:18:33,720 --> 04:18:34,960
And your demon form...

5003
04:18:35,940 --> 04:18:37,760
Makes it so that you stop aging.

5004
04:18:39,340 --> 04:18:40,380
It'll be great.

5005
04:18:40,600 --> 04:18:41,740
Time to finish this, Virgil.

5006
04:18:43,560 --> 04:18:44,740
Once and for all.

5007
04:18:46,960 --> 04:18:49,280
Oh, it's all the human blood sacrifices.

5008
04:18:50,980 --> 04:18:53,280
I won't lose to the rights of you.

5009
04:18:53,280 --> 04:18:55,760
Oh, why am I carrying this giant...

5010
04:18:56,400 --> 04:18:56,620
Oh.

5011
04:18:57,180 --> 04:18:57,560
Meow.

5012
04:18:57,920 --> 04:18:58,260
Meow.

5013
04:18:59,420 --> 04:19:00,560
Oh my golly.

5014
04:19:03,040 --> 04:19:05,120
I feel like I should fight him with Dante.

5015
04:19:11,770 --> 04:19:12,770
I'm slow.

5016
04:19:13,210 --> 04:19:13,650
I'm slow.

5017
04:19:23,760 --> 04:19:25,520
Oh, I remember that.

5018
04:19:51,060 --> 04:19:51,740
Cool.

5019
04:19:53,760 --> 04:19:55,260
Where's your motivation?

5020
04:19:58,020 --> 04:19:59,600
Give him the hat.

5021
04:20:02,040 --> 04:20:02,720
Wait.

5022
04:20:03,440 --> 04:20:03,680
No.

5023
04:20:03,900 --> 04:20:04,200
No, no.

5024
04:20:04,680 --> 04:20:05,000
Come here.

5025
04:20:05,120 --> 04:20:05,280
Come here.

5026
04:20:06,180 --> 04:20:06,640
Wait.

5027
04:20:06,900 --> 04:20:06,960
Oh.

5028
04:20:07,600 --> 04:20:08,060
Sorry.

5029
04:20:08,120 --> 04:20:08,360
Hold on.

5030
04:20:08,600 --> 04:20:09,300
I'm messing it up.

5031
04:20:13,180 --> 04:20:14,980
He doesn't want it!

5032
04:20:15,660 --> 04:20:16,680
I'm gonna cry.

5033
04:20:17,380 --> 04:20:17,920
No.

5034
04:20:21,820 --> 04:20:22,740
Foolishness.

5035
04:20:27,040 --> 04:20:27,960
No.

5036
04:20:28,280 --> 04:20:28,460
No.

5037
04:20:32,240 --> 04:20:33,160
Foolishness.

5038
04:20:33,160 --> 04:20:33,960
Whoop.

5039
04:20:42,540 --> 04:20:43,500
Ow.

5040
04:20:44,060 --> 04:20:44,120
Oops.

5041
04:20:44,600 --> 04:20:45,900
I did not realize what was happening.

5042
04:20:57,680 --> 04:20:58,160
Ugh.

5043
04:21:03,350 --> 04:21:03,750
Nine.

5044
04:21:14,850 --> 04:21:17,430
If I DT, can he DT?

5045
04:21:20,030 --> 04:21:21,210
Oh, yeah.

5046
04:21:26,530 --> 04:21:27,810
Oh, shoot.

5047
04:21:33,150 --> 04:21:34,590
What kind of fool are you?

5048
04:21:34,670 --> 04:21:35,470
Is that what he just said?

5049
04:21:36,410 --> 04:21:36,490
Oh.

5050
04:21:36,830 --> 04:21:37,350
Oh.

5051
04:21:37,630 --> 04:21:38,270
Ouchy, ouch.

5052
04:21:38,890 --> 04:21:39,770
Stop with me.

5053
04:21:41,050 --> 04:21:42,530
Let's end this, Dante.

5054
04:21:43,330 --> 04:21:44,150
No, no, no!

5055
04:21:47,070 --> 04:21:48,030
Get up, Dante!

5056
04:21:49,710 --> 04:21:50,830
Oh my gosh.

5057
04:21:55,830 --> 04:21:56,770
Ouchy, ouch.

5058
04:21:58,650 --> 04:21:59,170
Ouch.

5059
04:21:59,170 --> 04:22:00,250
Come on.

5060
04:22:00,650 --> 04:22:01,630
I was running.

5061
04:22:03,970 --> 04:22:04,610
Okay.

5062
04:22:04,930 --> 04:22:05,790
I'm scared to use it.

5063
04:22:05,950 --> 04:22:06,890
I'm not gonna lie.

5064
04:22:08,770 --> 04:22:10,230
I'm scared to use it.

5065
04:22:32,460 --> 04:22:33,100
Scum.

5066
04:22:39,300 --> 04:22:40,260
My health.

5067
04:22:40,260 --> 04:22:43,080
You're forced.

5068
04:22:44,060 --> 04:22:44,700
Oh.

5069
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:49,200
I should've used it.

5070
04:22:50,600 --> 04:22:52,060
I should've used it.

5071
04:22:52,920 --> 04:22:53,560
Scum.

5072
04:23:00,560 --> 04:23:03,400
Yeah, for now.

5073
04:23:05,640 --> 04:23:06,280
Scum.

5074
04:23:09,060 --> 04:23:10,440
Use the gold...

5075
04:23:10,440 --> 04:23:10,540
Use the gold...

5076
04:23:10,540 --> 04:23:11,100
Gorbs here?

5077
04:23:11,340 --> 04:23:11,780
Maybe.

5078
04:23:12,380 --> 04:23:13,260
I'll try...

5079
04:23:13,260 --> 04:23:14,220
I wanna try one more time.

5080
04:23:14,380 --> 04:23:15,520
And then we can use Gorbs, you know?

5081
04:23:16,360 --> 04:23:16,520
Hmm.

5082
04:23:18,160 --> 04:23:21,620
I won't lose to the likes of you, little brother.

5083
04:23:23,360 --> 04:23:24,120
Oh my god.

5084
04:23:24,280 --> 04:23:25,040
I tried to...

5085
04:23:25,040 --> 04:23:26,460
Oh my...

5086
04:23:36,550 --> 04:23:37,310
Take that.

5087
04:23:38,030 --> 04:23:38,690
Yeah.

5088
04:23:41,200 --> 04:23:41,860
Yeah.

5089
04:23:44,280 --> 04:23:45,360
Too slow.

5090
04:23:45,780 --> 04:23:46,540
Says you.

5091
04:23:47,020 --> 04:23:48,040
Excuse me?

5092
04:23:49,100 --> 04:23:49,760
Oh.

5093
04:23:49,980 --> 04:23:50,380
I'm...

5094
04:23:50,380 --> 04:23:51,760
I mistimed that so badly.

5095
04:24:01,590 --> 04:24:02,570
It's fine.

5096
04:24:03,110 --> 04:24:03,390
Ugh.

5097
04:24:03,770 --> 04:24:05,790
I don't know what I was thinking, to be honest.

5098
04:24:06,610 --> 04:24:06,980
Oh.

5099
04:24:23,910 --> 04:24:25,450
What are you doing close...

5100
04:24:25,450 --> 04:24:26,090
So close to me?

5101
04:24:26,790 --> 04:24:27,490
Don't move.

5102
04:24:28,050 --> 04:24:28,430
Oi!

5103
04:24:36,830 --> 04:24:37,930
You're finished.

5104
04:24:38,670 --> 04:24:39,470
Oh, ow.

5105
04:24:40,790 --> 04:24:41,070
Ugh.

5106
04:24:45,600 --> 04:24:47,860
I forgot that it has this now.

5107
04:24:50,160 --> 04:24:51,200
The...the...what's it called?

5108
04:24:52,460 --> 04:24:53,440
The extra...

5109
04:24:53,440 --> 04:24:55,480
Ever since I became...

5110
04:24:55,480 --> 04:24:56,440
Ultra powerful.

5111
04:24:56,820 --> 04:24:57,240
Awesome.

5112
04:24:57,440 --> 04:24:57,640
Cool.

5113
04:25:00,300 --> 04:25:00,740
Foolish.

5114
04:25:02,760 --> 04:25:03,200
Ouch!

5115
04:25:07,670 --> 04:25:09,310
Why does it feel so hard to get...

5116
04:25:09,770 --> 04:25:11,230
To get...what's it called right now?

5117
04:25:18,000 --> 04:25:18,440
Scam.

5118
04:25:20,440 --> 04:25:21,060
Oh boy.

5119
04:25:21,560 --> 04:25:22,440
Oh no.

5120
04:25:22,640 --> 04:25:23,280
Wait, I can't.

5121
04:25:23,320 --> 04:25:23,940
That's so unfair.

5122
04:25:24,480 --> 04:25:25,260
No, no, no.

5123
04:25:25,440 --> 04:25:26,280
No, no, no.

5124
04:25:26,500 --> 04:25:27,600
I can't right now.

5125
04:25:28,780 --> 04:25:29,480
No, no.

5126
04:25:29,620 --> 04:25:30,440
This is so unfair.

5127
04:25:31,000 --> 04:25:31,300
Hahaha.

5128
04:25:32,340 --> 04:25:33,660
No, no, no, no, no.

5129
04:25:33,800 --> 04:25:35,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5130
04:25:35,440 --> 04:25:36,100
No, wait.

5131
04:25:36,460 --> 04:25:36,980
No, no, no.

5132
04:25:42,870 --> 04:25:43,950
I'm a dodging queen.

5133
04:25:44,950 --> 04:25:45,330
Hahaha.

5134
04:25:49,840 --> 04:25:50,500
I'm scared.

5135
04:25:50,660 --> 04:25:51,140
What is he gonna do?

5136
04:25:52,700 --> 04:25:53,080
Prepare.

5137
04:25:54,820 --> 04:25:55,580
To die.

5138
04:25:56,440 --> 04:25:56,800
Uh.

5139
04:25:57,000 --> 04:25:57,440
Where's he going?

5140
04:25:58,400 --> 04:25:58,680
Oh.

5141
04:26:00,340 --> 04:26:00,720
Oh.

5142
04:26:01,320 --> 04:26:02,020
Oh, I...

5143
04:26:02,020 --> 04:26:03,460
Oh, that took so much.

5144
04:26:04,080 --> 04:26:04,560
Wait.

5145
04:26:04,700 --> 04:26:05,220
What the hell?

5146
04:26:06,600 --> 04:26:07,440
Oh my god.

5147
04:26:08,760 --> 04:26:08,860
Wait.

5148
04:26:09,220 --> 04:26:09,960
I bet the DT.

5149
04:26:10,220 --> 04:26:10,360
Wait.

5150
04:26:10,460 --> 04:26:11,160
I tried the DT.

5151
04:26:12,460 --> 04:26:13,580
I tried the DT.

5152
04:26:14,220 --> 04:26:14,980
Holy hell.

5153
04:26:15,340 --> 04:26:16,720
I pressed...I pressed it.

5154
04:26:16,880 --> 04:26:18,460
It didn't go through.

5155
04:26:19,580 --> 04:26:20,700
So that's it.

5156
04:26:22,380 --> 04:26:23,000
Hold on.

5157
04:26:23,000 --> 04:26:24,020
I wanna try that though.

5158
04:26:24,760 --> 04:26:25,320
Oh.

5159
04:26:25,760 --> 04:26:25,960
Uh.

5160
04:26:34,120 --> 04:26:35,240
You guys...

5161
04:26:35,880 --> 04:26:37,780
Everybody's play styles are different, okay?

5162
04:26:38,320 --> 04:26:38,880
So...

5163
04:26:38,880 --> 04:26:40,260
Just remember that.

5164
04:26:40,920 --> 04:26:42,000
Just remember that.

5165
04:26:42,440 --> 04:26:43,240
You guys...

5166
04:26:43,240 --> 04:26:45,200
If you don't like it, you don't gotta watch.

5167
04:26:45,340 --> 04:26:45,800
That's okay.

5168
04:26:46,120 --> 04:26:46,500
You know?

5169
04:26:47,980 --> 04:26:48,880
Do it.

5170
04:26:48,880 --> 04:26:48,920
Do it.

5171
04:26:51,340 --> 04:26:52,300
I feel...

5172
04:26:52,300 --> 04:26:53,940
How far did I get with his health?

5173
04:26:54,160 --> 04:26:54,720
I felt...

5174
04:26:54,720 --> 04:26:55,260
What was it like?

5175
04:26:55,360 --> 04:26:57,260
A little...

5176
04:26:57,260 --> 04:26:58,880
A little...

5177
04:27:00,260 --> 04:27:00,740
Yogurt.

5178
04:27:01,740 --> 04:27:02,220
Yogurt!

5179
04:27:05,200 --> 04:27:06,120
About halfway.

5180
04:27:06,740 --> 04:27:06,960
Ah.

5181
04:27:08,380 --> 04:27:09,440
Let me do one more.

5182
04:27:10,500 --> 04:27:11,680
Let me do one more.

5183
04:27:13,420 --> 04:27:14,760
Let me do one more.

5184
04:27:16,980 --> 04:27:18,460
50% is not bad.

5185
04:27:22,600 --> 04:27:23,160
Yogurt.

5186
04:27:24,720 --> 04:27:27,420
What if I need all 16 for the last boss?

5187
04:27:29,140 --> 04:27:30,900
What if I need all 16?

5188
04:27:33,680 --> 04:27:34,420
Okay, let's go back.

5189
04:27:34,660 --> 04:27:34,800
Oh.

5190
04:27:35,360 --> 04:27:36,240
Come on.

5191
04:27:40,260 --> 04:27:41,380
Come on.

5192
04:27:41,880 --> 04:27:43,520
And I did pretty well with having...

5193
04:27:43,520 --> 04:27:45,180
With not taking any damage for...

5194
04:27:47,060 --> 04:27:48,140
For the first part.

5195
04:27:48,340 --> 04:27:49,600
Except this, you know.

5196
04:27:50,660 --> 04:27:51,140
Ah!

5197
04:27:51,640 --> 04:27:52,120
Oh.

5198
04:27:52,800 --> 04:27:53,280
Oop.

5199
04:27:53,580 --> 04:27:54,540
That kinda sucked.

5200
04:27:57,100 --> 04:27:57,480
Yelp!

5201
04:28:07,430 --> 04:28:07,810
Yeah!

5202
04:28:11,620 --> 04:28:12,380
Foolishness.

5203
04:28:13,780 --> 04:28:14,500
Scum.

5204
04:28:18,160 --> 04:28:18,880
Aw.

5205
04:28:33,220 --> 04:28:33,800
You...

5206
04:28:33,800 --> 04:28:34,220
Whee!

5207
04:28:34,640 --> 04:28:35,360
Oh.

5208
04:28:46,050 --> 04:28:46,770
Yeah!

5209
04:28:48,850 --> 04:28:49,570
Alright.

5210
04:28:49,730 --> 04:28:50,670
And I'm saving my...

5211
04:28:50,670 --> 04:28:51,070
DT!

5212
04:28:58,880 --> 04:29:01,900
I'm wondering if I should...

5213
04:29:03,420 --> 04:29:06,700
I'm trying to decide if I wanna have it for like...

5214
04:29:06,700 --> 04:29:07,860
It's DT or...

5215
04:29:07,860 --> 04:29:08,480
Yeah, that's right.

5216
04:29:08,940 --> 04:29:09,840
Oh, golly.

5217
04:29:10,060 --> 04:29:10,260
Okay.

5218
04:29:19,890 --> 04:29:21,750
Is there any point?

5219
04:29:22,470 --> 04:29:23,610
Is there any point?

5220
04:29:24,610 --> 04:29:26,010
Is there any point?

5221
04:29:27,650 --> 04:29:28,770
Oh, golly.

5222
04:29:28,970 --> 04:29:31,210
He ran out way sooner than I did.

5223
04:29:31,210 --> 04:29:33,150
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

5224
04:29:33,170 --> 04:29:34,670
Or I ran out rather...

5225
04:29:34,670 --> 04:29:36,390
I ran out way sooner than he did!

5226
04:29:36,850 --> 04:29:37,830
Woo hoo hoo hoo wee!

5227
04:29:46,700 --> 04:29:47,260
Uh oh.

5228
04:29:47,680 --> 04:29:48,640
Fine, I'll use trickster!

5229
04:30:04,900 --> 04:30:05,680
Good job guys.

5230
04:30:08,820 --> 04:30:09,620
Good trickster.

5231
04:30:10,560 --> 04:30:14,680
I think it helps to read him better.

5232
04:30:25,410 --> 04:30:27,810
Wait, what am I... Holy!

5233
04:30:39,760 --> 04:30:40,480
Ouch!

5234
04:30:40,920 --> 04:30:42,620
How did that hit me?!

5235
04:30:42,620 --> 04:30:46,460
Ugh, Sam.

5236
04:30:58,810 --> 04:30:59,530
Yeah.

5237
04:31:29,640 --> 04:31:32,720
I don't know, I feel so comfortable using it.

5238
04:31:33,840 --> 04:31:36,580
Okay, what I'm gonna do is... Oh, wait.

5239
04:31:38,100 --> 04:31:41,440
Is... I'm gonna actually... We're gonna go with the big boy.

5240
04:31:42,380 --> 04:31:43,460
Maybe next time.

5241
04:32:04,160 --> 04:32:05,260
Oh, golly.

5242
04:32:06,760 --> 04:32:08,580
Okay, I just gotta dodge.

5243
04:32:22,980 --> 04:32:23,400
Oh, shit.

5244
04:32:23,600 --> 04:32:23,940
Oh, shit.

5245
04:32:24,020 --> 04:32:24,300
Oh, shit.

5246
04:32:24,380 --> 04:32:25,180
Oh, shit.

5247
04:32:25,320 --> 04:32:25,960
Oh, shit.

5248
04:32:26,160 --> 04:32:27,160
So much for that.

5249
04:32:41,500 --> 04:32:44,480
Wait, now if I do this...

5250
04:32:53,040 --> 04:32:54,320
Wait, he's not even hitting him.

5251
04:32:55,980 --> 04:32:56,800
Wait, hit him.

5252
04:33:03,410 --> 04:33:04,630
Okay, that did good damage.

5253
04:33:05,190 --> 04:33:07,370
But I have so little health now.

5254
04:33:12,980 --> 04:33:14,680
Whoa, so cool.

5255
04:33:15,360 --> 04:33:15,980
Okay, come here.

5256
04:33:23,620 --> 04:33:25,620
Okay, I'm gonna... You're so powerful, Virgil!

5257
04:33:27,320 --> 04:33:27,960
Oh, my God.

5258
04:33:28,060 --> 04:33:29,080
He just DT'd again.

5259
04:33:29,580 --> 04:33:29,740
You!

5260
04:33:30,300 --> 04:33:31,140
That's so unfair.

5261
04:33:31,600 --> 04:33:32,800
How do you have so much DT?

5262
04:33:33,080 --> 04:33:33,340
Huh?

5263
04:33:34,580 --> 04:33:35,520
How do you have it?

5264
04:33:37,680 --> 04:33:38,540
Is he healing?

5265
04:33:39,440 --> 04:33:41,460
If he is, it's very slow.

5266
04:33:42,880 --> 04:33:44,940
If he is, it's very slow.

5267
04:34:02,290 --> 04:34:02,730
Yeah,

5268
04:34:07,840 --> 04:34:09,200
but not as... Ouch!

5269
04:34:09,440 --> 04:34:09,540
Ouch!

5270
04:34:09,760 --> 04:34:09,920
Oh!

5271
04:34:10,380 --> 04:34:10,960
There I go.

5272
04:34:11,300 --> 04:34:11,500
Wait.

5273
04:34:13,080 --> 04:34:14,300
I'm still in the game!

5274
04:34:14,640 --> 04:34:15,380
I'm still in the game!

5275
04:34:17,760 --> 04:34:20,620
My son means nothing to me.

5276
04:34:20,660 --> 04:34:21,000
Aww.

5277
04:34:23,160 --> 04:34:23,680
Poor...

5278
04:34:24,720 --> 04:34:25,240
Poor...

5279
04:34:25,240 --> 04:34:25,600
Poor...

5280
04:34:25,600 --> 04:34:25,860
Mero.

5281
04:34:26,320 --> 04:34:27,360
Come on, man.

5282
04:34:30,120 --> 04:34:31,160
Come on...

5283
04:34:36,560 --> 04:34:37,020
Oh!

5284
04:34:37,580 --> 04:34:38,100
No!

5285
04:34:38,640 --> 04:34:40,180
I really should have DT'd.

5286
04:34:40,360 --> 04:34:41,020
It's okay, though.

5287
04:34:41,640 --> 04:34:42,800
I'll use a Gorb.

5288
04:34:43,960 --> 04:34:44,680
It's okay.

5289
04:34:45,240 --> 04:34:46,640
I was too distracted.

5290
04:34:47,420 --> 04:34:47,960
Oh, wait.

5291
04:34:48,020 --> 04:34:48,760
Why did I do that now?

5292
04:34:48,760 --> 04:34:48,820
I don't know.

5293
04:34:49,680 --> 04:34:50,200
Hold on.

5294
04:34:55,000 --> 04:34:56,930
What the?

5295
04:34:57,790 --> 04:34:58,470
What is this?

5296
04:34:58,690 --> 04:34:59,010
What is...

5297
04:34:59,010 --> 04:34:59,310
Wait!

5298
04:34:59,450 --> 04:34:59,630
Wait!

5299
04:34:59,690 --> 04:35:00,510
I couldn't even see!

5300
04:35:01,290 --> 04:35:02,070
The...the...the camera!

5301
04:35:02,430 --> 04:35:04,410
I don't even know...I thought it was still in the cutscene!

5302
04:35:04,770 --> 04:35:05,430
Are you kidding me?

5303
04:35:19,970 --> 04:35:21,450
I can't...I can't see anything!

5304
04:35:22,810 --> 04:35:23,550
Oh, there.

5305
04:35:23,710 --> 04:35:24,250
Oh, my gosh.

5306
04:35:24,370 --> 04:35:24,610
Wait!

5307
04:35:25,530 --> 04:35:25,930
Ouch.

5308
04:35:28,430 --> 04:35:29,910
He's not even DT'd anymore.

5309
04:35:30,390 --> 04:35:31,170
Okay, hold on.

5310
04:35:31,450 --> 04:35:32,150
Oh, my gosh.

5311
04:35:46,800 --> 04:35:47,960
We're so close, guys.

5312
04:35:57,820 --> 04:35:58,260
Yeah!

5313
04:35:58,800 --> 04:35:59,200
Yeah!

5314
04:35:59,380 --> 04:35:59,760
It's a victory!

5315
04:36:01,780 --> 04:36:02,220
Oh!

5316
04:36:02,360 --> 04:36:03,140
Oh, that was sad.

5317
04:36:06,500 --> 04:36:07,920
Oi, oi, oi, oi!

5318
04:36:08,360 --> 04:36:09,380
I almost had him.

5319
04:36:10,280 --> 04:36:10,720
Oh!

5320
04:36:11,220 --> 04:36:11,460
Run!

5321
04:36:11,720 --> 04:36:12,020
Run!

5322
04:36:12,220 --> 04:36:12,840
Run, run, run!

5323
04:36:12,940 --> 04:36:13,420
Dante, run!

5324
04:36:13,760 --> 04:36:14,540
Oh, my God!

5325
04:36:14,620 --> 04:36:15,260
That was so close!

5326
04:36:15,620 --> 04:36:16,060
Hahaha!

5327
04:36:20,720 --> 04:36:20,760
Hahaha!

5328
04:36:20,760 --> 04:36:21,140
Come on!

5329
04:36:21,280 --> 04:36:21,860
You can do it!

5330
04:36:23,360 --> 04:36:23,800
Aaaaah!

5331
04:36:26,080 --> 04:36:27,240
Not him, DT!

5332
04:36:27,460 --> 04:36:28,220
I guess it is so...

5333
04:36:28,220 --> 04:36:28,680
Hahaha!

5334
04:36:36,120 --> 04:36:36,400
Oops.

5335
04:36:36,640 --> 04:36:36,780
Eh?

5336
04:36:38,000 --> 04:36:39,640
Oh, no, no, no...

5337
04:36:40,820 --> 04:36:41,260
Please...

5338
04:36:41,260 --> 04:36:41,600
Oh, my God!

5339
04:36:41,660 --> 04:36:42,580
He healed so much!

5340
04:36:43,360 --> 04:36:44,500
He healed so much!

5341
04:36:47,520 --> 04:36:48,060
I

5342
04:37:12,940 --> 04:37:18,340
can't believe I almost had that fight and I completely... What are these?

5343
04:37:19,840 --> 04:37:21,900
What the hell is this?!

5344
04:37:21,900 --> 04:37:25,380
What is going on?

5345
04:37:25,500 --> 04:37:26,440
Wait, why can't I move?

5346
04:37:27,480 --> 04:37:29,900
Why is this happening?!

5347
04:37:29,900 --> 04:37:30,480
Huh?!

5348
04:37:30,480 --> 04:37:35,020
Why

5349
04:37:38,790 --> 04:37:40,250
couldn't I move?!

5350
04:37:40,250 --> 04:37:42,510
Why couldn't I go...?

5351
04:37:42,510 --> 04:37:43,130
I got stuck!

5352
04:37:43,130 --> 04:37:44,150
Done?!

5353
04:37:44,150 --> 04:37:50,130
Oh my god... I was... I was so mad that I had him!

5354
04:37:50,610 --> 04:37:52,370
I... I HAD HIM!

5355
04:37:53,410 --> 04:37:55,070
I'm gonna... Whatever, though.

5356
04:37:55,630 --> 04:37:55,950
It's okay.

5357
04:37:56,310 --> 04:38:00,490
Two endless forms...

5358
04:38:05,700 --> 04:38:08,920
It was all my fault.

5359
04:38:09,380 --> 04:38:14,980
I completely... I fumbled it so hard.

5360
04:38:15,120 --> 04:38:16,000
I had it!

5361
04:38:16,180 --> 04:38:17,840
And I fumbled it so hard!

5362
04:38:20,320 --> 04:38:22,200
It's because I'm in fucking Trickster!

5363
04:38:23,880 --> 04:38:24,640
That's why!

5364
04:38:34,790 --> 04:38:35,770
Are you coming out?

5365
04:38:41,650 --> 04:38:42,810
Just SDT?

5366
04:38:43,390 --> 04:38:43,870
Okay.

5367
04:38:50,610 --> 04:38:52,670
Let's get him with a big move at the end, huh?

5368
04:38:53,710 --> 04:38:54,390
Yee-haw!

5369
04:38:55,510 --> 04:38:56,050
Yee-haw!

5370
04:38:56,050 --> 04:38:56,130
Yee-haw!

5371
04:38:56,390 --> 04:38:56,390
Yee-haw!

5372
04:38:56,610 --> 04:38:56,690
Yee-haw!

5373
04:38:58,590 --> 04:38:59,070
That's

5374
04:39:07,350 --> 04:39:08,230
not how that's supposed to work.

5375
04:39:08,230 --> 04:39:08,230
Hello.

5376
04:39:08,430 --> 04:39:09,950
Hero.enz it, girl.成 my son.

5377
04:39:11,190 --> 04:39:11,650
Uh... Yeah!

5378
04:39:11,770 --> 04:39:12,310
... dumbass!

5379
04:39:13,070 --> 04:39:15,270
You should remember though that thick skull of yours?

5380
04:39:15,470 --> 04:39:16,550
I was doing... Hey.

5381
04:39:16,750 --> 04:39:16,870
Dante!

5382
04:39:17,010 --> 04:39:17,630
seemed tired.

5383
04:39:17,750 --> 04:39:17,830
That's not bad.

5384
04:39:17,830 --> 04:39:18,270
I was doing better.

5385
04:39:18,570 --> 04:39:18,590
Oh!

5386
04:39:18,590 --> 04:39:19,030
Wow!weh!

5387
04:39:19,990 --> 04:39:21,690
That was a long time ago.

5388
04:39:22,430 --> 04:39:22,890
Hahaha!

5389
04:39:23,630 --> 04:39:25,210
I guess you were young once too?

5390
04:39:25,630 --> 04:39:26,090
Aw.

5391
04:39:26,250 --> 04:39:31,110
As much as I'd love to hear that story... I think it's about time we... ended this.

5392
04:39:31,390 --> 04:39:32,030
Oh my god!

5393
04:39:32,150 --> 04:39:33,410
They finished each other's sandwiches.

5394
04:39:34,850 --> 04:39:35,890
You died twice!

5395
04:39:36,470 --> 04:39:36,670
Uh!

5396
04:39:36,810 --> 04:39:37,510
Not at the end!

5397
04:39:37,530 --> 04:39:38,210
I was–!..

5398
04:39:38,210 --> 04:39:38,210
riesengiging voices down!

5399
04:39:38,230 --> 04:39:39,070
I was like this.

5400
04:39:39,370 --> 04:39:40,290
What are you talking about?

5401
04:39:42,690 --> 04:39:44,170
Virgil also gorbed.

5402
04:39:44,330 --> 04:39:44,650
He did.

5403
04:40:03,170 --> 04:40:03,810
Raiden.

5404
04:40:08,550 --> 04:40:09,190
What?

5405
04:40:17,600 --> 04:40:18,240
No.

5406
04:40:18,960 --> 04:40:19,740
No way.

5407
04:40:20,080 --> 04:40:20,840
Little baby.

5408
04:40:21,980 --> 04:40:24,160
Is it my... It's gotta be my little baby.

5409
04:40:27,140 --> 04:40:28,680
It's my little baby.

5410
04:40:30,220 --> 04:40:33,420
The brotherhood defined by hatred and grudging respect.

5411
04:40:36,400 --> 04:40:37,480
True power.

5412
04:40:37,660 --> 04:40:39,480
Oh my god, he can finally DT once again.

5413
04:40:47,220 --> 04:40:49,220
Wow, it's only been three hours.

5414
04:40:49,600 --> 04:40:51,840
Like, I remember when it said 1 p.m.

5415
04:40:52,380 --> 04:40:53,540
On like the clock.

5416
04:40:54,340 --> 04:40:55,220
Is that you, Nero?

5417
04:40:55,460 --> 04:40:56,320
He's calling his girl.

5418
04:40:56,320 --> 04:40:57,020
Did something happen?

5419
04:40:57,320 --> 04:40:57,620
Aww.

5420
04:41:01,300 --> 04:41:02,420
Kiria, you must not live here.

5421
04:41:02,420 --> 04:41:05,280
When I was a kid, I... I was alone.

5422
04:41:05,540 --> 04:41:06,820
He's calling his girl for support.

5423
04:41:07,040 --> 04:41:08,260
You and Cradle were all I knew.

5424
04:41:10,060 --> 04:41:10,840
Oh, a credit card.

5425
04:41:10,840 --> 04:41:12,880
And now, all of a sudden, I find out I have a family.

5426
04:41:14,160 --> 04:41:15,560
What am I supposed to do with that?

5427
04:41:17,500 --> 04:41:19,860
You always know which path is right.

5428
04:41:22,500 --> 04:41:24,380
There's no need to doubt yourself.

5429
04:41:27,620 --> 04:41:28,120
Thanks.

5430
04:41:29,900 --> 04:41:31,800
I guess that's all I needed to hear.

5431
04:41:33,900 --> 04:41:34,400
No.

5432
04:41:37,080 --> 04:41:38,820
I have one last thing to take care of.

5433
04:41:45,720 --> 04:41:50,320
Can you imagine if she's like, wait, Nero, I have one more thing to tell you.

5434
04:41:50,520 --> 04:41:51,660
You have a...

5435
04:41:51,660 --> 04:41:52,680
And then got cut off.

5436
04:41:55,200 --> 04:41:55,760
I'm...

5437
04:41:55,760 --> 04:41:56,640
I'm Greg.

5438
04:41:57,080 --> 04:41:57,740
Cut off.

5439
04:41:58,080 --> 04:41:58,660
To this day.

5440
04:41:59,460 --> 04:42:01,840
I hate myself for not having enough strength.

5441
04:42:03,000 --> 04:42:04,500
But this time is different.

5442
04:42:19,460 --> 04:42:20,680
He's a lizard.

5443
04:42:31,480 --> 04:42:32,560
His stand.

5444
04:42:33,300 --> 04:42:33,560
Woo!

5445
04:42:59,830 --> 04:43:01,270
He could finally...

5446
04:43:02,830 --> 04:43:03,430
Curious.

5447
04:43:03,610 --> 04:43:03,870
Curious.

5448
04:43:03,870 --> 04:43:04,150
Curious.

5449
04:43:04,310 --> 04:43:04,610
Nero.

5450
04:43:09,510 --> 04:43:10,770
Oh, my God.

5451
04:43:12,310 --> 04:43:13,270
Yeah, Papa.

5452
04:43:16,050 --> 04:43:17,630
The power of family.

5453
04:43:18,510 --> 04:43:20,210
That's what keeps those movies.

5454
04:43:20,650 --> 04:43:20,970
Uh, the...

5455
04:43:26,390 --> 04:43:27,750
Oh, my gosh.

5456
04:43:27,890 --> 04:43:28,090
What...

5457
04:43:28,090 --> 04:43:28,450
Oh, gosh.

5458
04:43:28,530 --> 04:43:29,450
What are those racing movies?

5459
04:43:29,730 --> 04:43:30,710
I can't remember.

5460
04:43:30,770 --> 04:43:31,250
Why am I...

5461
04:43:31,250 --> 04:43:32,210
I told you already.

5462
04:43:32,470 --> 04:43:33,750
This is not your...

5463
04:43:33,750 --> 04:43:34,370
Oh!

5464
04:43:34,830 --> 04:43:35,150
Jeez!

5465
04:43:36,210 --> 04:43:37,110
Fast and Furious.

5466
04:43:37,110 --> 04:43:37,610
Thank you.

5467
04:43:37,810 --> 04:43:38,570
I'm so stupid.

5468
04:43:39,170 --> 04:43:41,210
Can't even hold up my own joke.

5469
04:43:41,910 --> 04:43:43,750
I won't let you kill each other.

5470
04:43:44,850 --> 04:43:47,250
There are other ways of settling your differences.

5471
04:43:47,950 --> 04:43:48,290
Oh, yeah.

5472
04:43:48,510 --> 04:43:48,870
Oh, my God.

5473
04:43:48,970 --> 04:43:50,730
Is the final boss fight therapy?

5474
04:43:54,730 --> 04:43:57,910
Final boss fight is you picking the right answers in therapy.

5475
04:43:58,210 --> 04:43:59,790
You came all this way just for that.

5476
04:44:00,030 --> 04:44:00,690
Dead weight.

5477
04:44:00,970 --> 04:44:01,490
Virgil.

5478
04:44:02,150 --> 04:44:02,670
V.

5479
04:44:03,670 --> 04:44:05,290
Whatever you call yourself.

5480
04:44:06,410 --> 04:44:07,910
Dante's not gonna die here.

5481
04:44:08,570 --> 04:44:09,790
And neither are you.

5482
04:44:09,930 --> 04:44:10,650
And neither are you.

5483
04:44:10,790 --> 04:44:11,410
Papa?

5484
04:44:11,550 --> 04:44:12,330
You have a problem with that.

5485
04:44:13,750 --> 04:44:15,490
Not gonna die my ass.

5486
04:44:15,810 --> 04:44:15,950
Oh.

5487
04:44:16,390 --> 04:44:18,050
That bitch slap nearly killed me.

5488
04:44:20,710 --> 04:44:22,290
If I beat Nero.

5489
04:44:23,690 --> 04:44:25,170
Then by default.

5490
04:44:26,990 --> 04:44:28,270
I beat you.

5491
04:44:28,670 --> 04:44:29,590
Agreed Dante.

5492
04:44:30,090 --> 04:44:30,310
What?

5493
04:44:31,790 --> 04:44:32,410
Whatever.

5494
04:44:33,210 --> 04:44:34,550
I don't really care.

5495
04:44:34,550 --> 04:44:36,330
I'm just gonna sit this one out.

5496
04:44:36,350 --> 04:44:37,650
Let my own man rest.

5497
04:44:40,230 --> 04:44:40,950
Okay.

5498
04:44:41,430 --> 04:44:41,710
What?

5499
04:44:42,970 --> 04:44:44,110
When this is over.

5500
04:44:45,290 --> 04:44:46,970
I'll make you submit.

5501
04:44:48,390 --> 04:44:48,950
Father.

5502
04:44:50,170 --> 04:44:53,650
Not the ghostly knuckle crab.

5503
04:44:56,830 --> 04:44:57,390
I'm gonna die.

5504
04:44:57,390 --> 04:44:57,670
Oh.

5505
04:44:57,670 --> 04:44:58,890
This has nothing to do with you.

5506
04:44:59,290 --> 04:45:00,350
Stand down.

5507
04:45:01,050 --> 04:45:02,390
Nothing to do with me.

5508
04:45:03,010 --> 04:45:04,330
That has everything to do with me.

5509
04:45:04,490 --> 04:45:05,170
Oh gosh.

5510
04:45:06,010 --> 04:45:06,130
Wait.

5511
04:45:07,490 --> 04:45:08,370
D-pad.

5512
04:45:08,370 --> 04:45:10,370
Add when DT gage is at 3.

5513
04:45:15,870 --> 04:45:17,470
Ow, it's a...

5514
04:45:18,250 --> 04:45:18,910
D-pad?

5515
04:45:19,690 --> 04:45:20,270
Wait...

5516
04:45:30,470 --> 04:45:32,390
Press RT near staggered enemy.

5517
04:45:32,830 --> 04:45:33,890
Perform a buster.

5518
04:45:35,290 --> 04:45:36,810
Oh, oh, I am... I'm pressing...

5519
04:45:36,810 --> 04:45:37,930
Ah, he's not staggered.

5520
04:45:38,370 --> 04:45:39,630
I guess, I'm staggered enough.

5521
04:45:51,740 --> 04:45:52,780
Oh, RT!

5522
04:45:53,100 --> 04:45:53,860
I'm so stupid.

5523
04:45:54,220 --> 04:45:54,860
I thought it was RB.

5524
04:45:59,020 --> 04:46:00,680
Okay, we'll do it next time.

5525
04:46:05,340 --> 04:46:06,120
Oh shoot.

5526
04:46:06,660 --> 04:46:07,560
Get out of there.

5527
04:46:08,420 --> 04:46:09,340
Oh, what a waste.

5528
04:46:11,040 --> 04:46:12,180
What a waste.

5529
04:46:34,510 --> 04:46:36,830
Oh yeah, I don't have a grabby arm anymore.

5530
04:46:36,970 --> 04:46:37,390
I just noticed.

5531
04:46:39,870 --> 04:46:40,470
Okay.

5532
04:46:40,470 --> 04:46:41,650
Oh, let's turn.

5533
04:46:43,670 --> 04:46:44,450
Oh no!

5534
04:46:46,810 --> 04:46:48,990
Oh, I forgot he could GT too.

5535
04:46:51,150 --> 04:46:52,110
RT, V2, please!

5536
04:46:52,390 --> 04:46:53,490
I didn't even realize!

5537
04:46:53,770 --> 04:46:54,210
I'm sorry!

5538
04:46:57,410 --> 04:46:58,530
I'm getting used to it!

5539
04:46:58,870 --> 04:47:00,110
They just threw this at me!

5540
04:47:00,470 --> 04:47:00,870
Please!

5541
04:47:06,390 --> 04:47:07,750
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5542
04:47:14,940 --> 04:47:16,440
Oh my gosh, I can even...

5543
04:47:17,480 --> 04:47:18,800
Even get him when he is DT'd.

5544
04:47:18,800 --> 04:47:19,220
Seed.

5545
04:47:21,320 --> 04:47:22,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

5546
04:47:23,540 --> 04:47:24,100
I'm waiting.

5547
04:47:36,370 --> 04:47:37,990
I got both of them!

5548
04:47:39,950 --> 04:47:40,910
Holy hell!

5549
04:47:41,270 --> 04:47:41,910
Oh my god.

5550
04:47:43,150 --> 04:47:43,790
How

5551
04:47:52,740 --> 04:47:53,840
am I supposed to dodge these now?

5552
04:47:55,280 --> 04:47:56,900
Just run faster, I suppose.

5553
04:48:01,120 --> 04:48:02,060
Grab him?

5554
04:48:03,040 --> 04:48:03,920
Can I?

5555
04:48:04,920 --> 04:48:06,480
Well, that didn't happen.

5556
04:48:08,480 --> 04:48:09,540
RT here.

5557
04:48:10,100 --> 04:48:11,340
Oh, oh my...

5558
04:48:11,340 --> 04:48:11,920
Oh, wait!

5559
04:48:12,040 --> 04:48:12,560
Come on, bud!

5560
04:48:12,960 --> 04:48:13,220
Zero!

5561
04:48:14,900 --> 04:48:15,460
Scum.

5562
04:48:16,240 --> 04:48:17,720
How does he have so much DT?

5563
04:48:24,760 --> 04:48:25,740
Oh my god.

5564
04:48:27,580 --> 04:48:29,380
Bang, bang, bang!

5565
04:48:29,460 --> 04:48:30,420
I'm trying to move!

5566
04:48:30,860 --> 04:48:31,420
Okay.

5567
04:48:32,500 --> 04:48:33,340
Where are you?

5568
04:48:34,620 --> 04:48:35,260
Ah, shoot.

5569
04:49:10,400 --> 04:49:12,660
Oh my goodness.

5570
04:49:14,860 --> 04:49:15,620
Ah!

5571
04:49:15,960 --> 04:49:16,300
Please!

5572
04:49:17,920 --> 04:49:18,680
Why!

5573
04:49:18,860 --> 04:49:19,240
Why?!

5574
04:49:19,240 --> 04:49:21,320
Oh my...

5575
04:49:21,320 --> 04:49:21,620
Oh my...

5576
04:49:21,620 --> 04:49:22,400
Oh my...

5577
04:49:22,400 --> 04:49:22,500
Oh shoot.

5578
04:49:22,640 --> 04:49:22,880
Oh my goodness...

5579
04:49:22,880 --> 04:49:23,040
Please!

5580
04:49:23,400 --> 04:49:24,760
Oh my gosh.

5581
04:49:40,120 --> 04:49:41,860
Why can't I do the last scoop?

5582
04:49:47,580 --> 04:49:49,380
You have a gun, that's so lame!

5583
04:49:50,540 --> 04:49:52,780
Oh, this is even more lame maybe.

5584
04:49:54,620 --> 04:49:56,760
I'm so upset right now.

5585
04:49:56,900 --> 04:49:57,880
I can't even think.

5586
04:50:02,300 --> 04:50:03,640
Oh, that's the wrong thing.

5587
04:50:03,840 --> 04:50:04,380
Where are you?

5588
04:50:09,780 --> 04:50:10,760
I need a second.

5589
04:51:36,330 --> 04:51:36,810
Okay.

5590
04:51:40,250 --> 04:51:42,410
I don't know why my brain doesn't work.

5591
04:52:04,900 --> 04:52:06,880
Like, I don't know why sometimes my...

5592
04:52:09,880 --> 04:52:12,660
My brain and my hands don't work.

5593
04:52:14,920 --> 04:52:16,300
It's so frustrating!

5594
04:52:34,820 --> 04:52:37,580
I don't know why my brain is running.

5595
04:52:44,060 --> 04:52:44,900
Okay.

5596
04:52:45,320 --> 04:52:45,800
RT.

5597
04:52:53,160 --> 04:52:54,000
Yeah!

5598
04:52:59,720 --> 04:53:00,120
Yeah.

5599
04:53:01,260 --> 04:53:02,400
Oh, and he's gone.

5600
04:53:12,000 --> 04:53:12,560
Oh, shoot.

5601
04:53:15,720 --> 04:53:23,140
Yeah, I know that the DT is recharging, so I'm just going to do it as much as I... whenever it's good, you know?

5602
04:53:24,020 --> 04:53:24,800
Oh my goodness.

5603
04:53:25,320 --> 04:53:25,460
Oh.

5604
04:53:25,960 --> 04:53:26,720
Oh, I hate.

5605
04:53:27,080 --> 04:53:27,760
I hate.

5606
04:53:29,840 --> 04:53:31,540
Wow, he has so much DT.

5607
04:53:33,680 --> 04:53:37,620
But I like... If I can get him down... Okay, here we go.

5608
04:53:53,710 --> 04:53:54,190
Yeah!

5609
04:53:58,230 --> 04:53:58,710
Yeah!

5610
04:54:08,410 --> 04:54:08,890
Yeah!

5611
04:54:11,610 --> 04:54:16,630
Holy... Did that even... Did me DT'ing during that even change it?

5612
04:54:16,630 --> 04:54:17,370
Ha ha ha.

5613
04:54:18,130 --> 04:54:18,530
Scum.

5614
04:54:20,490 --> 04:54:20,890
Oh.

5615
04:54:21,070 --> 04:54:21,870
I was too slow.

5616
04:54:22,770 --> 04:54:23,790
I was too slow.

5617
04:54:26,150 --> 04:54:26,550
Oh.

5618
04:54:26,690 --> 04:54:27,190
Oh, shoot.

5619
04:54:27,310 --> 04:54:27,810
He did that.

5620
04:54:36,930 --> 04:54:38,450
I'm letting it recharge more.

5621
04:54:39,890 --> 04:54:40,290
Oh.

5622
04:54:40,410 --> 04:54:41,330
I have to grab him, right?

5623
04:54:41,530 --> 04:54:41,810
Okay.

5624
04:54:44,330 --> 04:54:45,590
I... I am pressing it.

5625
04:54:45,650 --> 04:54:46,090
I promise.

5626
04:54:46,790 --> 04:54:47,630
I'm pressing it.

5627
04:54:47,690 --> 04:54:47,990
I am.

5628
04:54:48,170 --> 04:54:48,590
I'm pressing it.

5629
04:54:48,590 --> 04:54:49,870
I'm RT'ing.

5630
04:54:49,990 --> 04:54:50,870
I'm RT'ing.

5631
04:54:53,270 --> 04:54:54,250
I'm RT'ing.

5632
04:54:54,250 --> 04:54:54,750
I'm RT'ing, I promise.

5633
04:54:56,390 --> 04:54:58,450
It must be a very tight window.

5634
04:54:59,950 --> 04:55:00,090
Oh.

5635
04:55:01,490 --> 04:55:02,010
Oy.

5636
04:55:22,960 --> 04:55:23,580
Oh, yeah.

5637
04:55:30,040 --> 04:55:30,920
Oh, my gosh.

5638
04:55:32,780 --> 04:55:33,300
Ah.

5639
04:55:33,560 --> 04:55:33,780
Shoot.

5640
04:55:34,140 --> 04:55:34,240
Ah.

5641
04:55:34,560 --> 04:55:34,680
Ah.

5642
04:55:34,820 --> 04:55:35,040
DT.

5643
04:55:35,460 --> 04:55:35,880
Sorry.

5644
04:55:36,540 --> 04:55:37,360
Yeah, I wish we're good.

5645
04:55:39,860 --> 04:55:40,640
Come on!

5646
04:55:40,640 --> 04:55:41,480
Oh, man.

5647
04:55:51,770 --> 04:55:52,250
Eheheheh.

5648
04:55:52,430 --> 04:55:53,270
Oh, please.

5649
04:55:58,790 --> 04:55:59,710
Oh, ah.

5650
04:56:00,710 --> 04:56:02,650
I've never seen him DT this long.

5651
04:56:02,830 --> 04:56:03,990
He's so... He's cheating?

5652
04:56:05,730 --> 04:56:07,730
Is this the extent of your power?

5653
04:56:08,690 --> 04:56:12,150
He... I feel like in the second half, he's DT'ed the whole time, no?

5654
04:56:12,590 --> 04:56:14,190
Can you snatch him when he blocks?

5655
04:56:14,290 --> 04:56:14,590
I'll try.

5656
04:56:17,790 --> 04:56:18,510
Gold him.

5657
04:56:18,670 --> 04:56:18,830
Okay.

5658
04:56:19,470 --> 04:56:20,850
If you guys allow me to.

5659
04:56:22,010 --> 04:56:22,830
Who are you?

5660
04:56:23,310 --> 04:56:23,870
Oh, oh.

5661
04:56:23,990 --> 04:56:25,090
Now he's back to normal.

5662
04:56:25,510 --> 04:56:25,850
Oh.

5663
04:56:25,850 --> 04:56:26,390
Oh, my God.

5664
04:56:26,590 --> 04:56:26,750
Wait.

5665
04:56:26,850 --> 04:56:27,590
I can't even see.

5666
04:56:27,850 --> 04:56:28,130
Please.

5667
04:56:30,370 --> 04:56:31,070
Where are you?

5668
04:56:31,210 --> 04:56:31,710
Oh, my God.

5669
04:56:31,870 --> 04:56:31,990
Oh.

5670
04:56:32,330 --> 04:56:33,310
And he's back, too.

5671
04:56:33,610 --> 04:56:33,870
Wait.

5672
04:56:33,930 --> 04:56:34,630
This is so unfair.

5673
04:56:47,380 --> 04:56:48,520
I'm trying to grab him.

5674
04:56:48,680 --> 04:56:49,320
It didn't work.

5675
04:56:49,560 --> 04:56:51,100
Unless it's like a...

5676
04:56:51,100 --> 04:56:51,440
Woo.

5677
04:57:05,110 --> 04:57:06,010
It's not working.

5678
04:57:06,150 --> 04:57:06,810
I don't know why.

5679
04:57:06,910 --> 04:57:07,330
Oh, there it is.

5680
04:57:07,550 --> 04:57:08,130
Oh, thank goodness.

5681
04:57:09,430 --> 04:57:09,890
Yeah.

5682
04:57:11,170 --> 04:57:11,630
Whoa.

5683
04:57:16,410 --> 04:57:17,370
Oh, my God.

5684
04:57:17,850 --> 04:57:18,310
Interesting.

5685
04:57:19,930 --> 04:57:21,690
How does he have so much DT?

5686
04:57:21,690 --> 04:57:22,390
Oh, my God.

5687
04:57:23,230 --> 04:57:23,270
Oh, honey.

5688
04:57:23,970 --> 04:57:24,530
How?

5689
04:57:29,230 --> 04:57:30,450
Enough, damn it.

5690
04:57:30,530 --> 04:57:30,850
Uhhh.

5691
04:57:31,470 --> 04:57:32,770
The underworld is taking over.

5692
04:57:33,210 --> 04:57:35,370
We need to do something before it's too late.

5693
04:57:43,870 --> 04:57:45,730
We need an apple.

5694
04:57:47,130 --> 04:57:49,750
An apple a day keeps the Virgil away.

5695
04:57:54,350 --> 04:57:54,830
Stinking.

5696
04:57:56,690 --> 04:58:03,350
And what's annoying about that last fight, what was making me so frustrated is they give you so much.

5697
04:58:03,350 --> 04:58:06,510
And it was just my inability.

5698
04:58:07,430 --> 04:58:12,010
That's what was making me so upset about it.

5699
04:58:15,270 --> 04:58:17,010
He's been collecting those plorbs.

5700
04:58:17,010 --> 04:58:17,430
I know.

5701
04:58:34,390 --> 04:58:37,030
You can't just expect me to stay here while you both go and...

5702
04:58:37,030 --> 04:58:38,410
It's because you're here we can go.

5703
04:58:40,410 --> 04:58:42,410
We're trusting you with things on this side.

5704
04:58:43,270 --> 04:58:43,710
Capiche?

5705
04:58:44,130 --> 04:58:44,570
Capiche.

5706
04:58:44,650 --> 04:58:45,170
Make haste Dante.

5707
04:58:46,450 --> 04:58:48,410
Yeah, I know.

5708
04:58:50,830 --> 04:58:52,070
Hey, wait!

5709
04:58:52,350 --> 04:58:53,530
You didn't say capiche!

5710
04:59:11,040 --> 04:59:12,240
Oh no!

5711
04:59:16,320 --> 04:59:17,640
Next time.

5712
04:59:18,540 --> 04:59:20,480
Hold on to that until then.

5713
04:59:46,160 --> 04:59:47,660
My silly brothers!

5714
04:59:50,840 --> 04:59:52,340
It's full of BL.

5715
04:59:53,060 --> 04:59:54,640
That's what I was thinking too.

5716
05:00:00,560 --> 05:00:03,100
I don't feel satisfied at all, but...

5717
05:00:03,100 --> 05:00:03,860
It's okay.

5718
05:00:09,760 --> 05:00:10,340
Same.

5719
05:00:10,640 --> 05:00:11,000
Me too.

5720
05:00:11,420 --> 05:00:11,700
Same.

5721
05:00:16,540 --> 05:00:18,020
Me too.

5722
05:00:21,620 --> 05:00:23,380
Yeah, that's what I said!

5723
05:00:31,660 --> 05:00:32,460
That's true.

5724
05:00:32,940 --> 05:00:33,780
That is true.

5725
05:00:33,780 --> 05:00:35,720
Do you know how much love and care I put in that devil breaker?

5726
05:00:37,120 --> 05:00:37,440
Nope.

5727
05:00:41,560 --> 05:00:42,420
With this arm?

5728
05:00:43,780 --> 05:00:44,520
That's nice.

5729
05:00:45,020 --> 05:00:45,400
Heh heh.

5730
05:00:48,160 --> 05:00:49,660
So, uh, how's it feel?

5731
05:00:49,720 --> 05:00:53,480
Yeah, Virgil literally going to hell so that he doesn't have to pay child support.

5732
05:00:53,480 --> 05:00:55,200
You're saving the man who killed your own father.

5733
05:00:56,980 --> 05:00:58,940
Heard Dante killed Virgil once.

5734
05:00:59,700 --> 05:01:00,800
Yeah, but he's still here.

5735
05:01:01,040 --> 05:01:01,400
It doesn't matter.

5736
05:01:01,760 --> 05:01:02,820
We're both gone now anyway.

5737
05:01:04,240 --> 05:01:05,120
Aw, Dante.

5738
05:01:05,820 --> 05:01:06,960
It's okay to cry.

5739
05:01:07,420 --> 05:01:09,620
If you want, Nero, over a loss.

5740
05:01:09,800 --> 05:01:10,400
Not cry.

5741
05:01:10,420 --> 05:01:11,740
It doesn't make you a cry, baby.

5742
05:01:12,380 --> 05:01:13,920
It does make you a little bitch, though.

5743
05:01:14,100 --> 05:01:14,820
There it is.

5744
05:01:15,860 --> 05:01:16,320
Heh heh.

5745
05:01:20,320 --> 05:01:21,420
You think I'm a demon?

5746
05:01:29,470 --> 05:01:31,430
I didn't cry when my asshole daddy died.

5747
05:01:32,670 --> 05:01:33,990
Yeah, I did that, sorry.

5748
05:01:34,210 --> 05:01:34,550
But...

5749
05:01:36,770 --> 05:01:38,110
Yeah, I know, I know.

5750
05:01:39,630 --> 05:01:41,010
I wouldn't be here without him.

5751
05:01:41,110 --> 05:01:42,090
That's a biological fact.

5752
05:01:45,290 --> 05:01:45,730
Right.

5753
05:01:47,430 --> 05:01:48,990
All I'm saying is, tough guy.

5754
05:01:50,430 --> 05:01:51,730
It's okay to cry if you want.

5755
05:01:52,710 --> 05:01:53,610
I'm not crying.

5756
05:01:53,950 --> 05:01:54,510
Devils cry.

5757
05:01:54,750 --> 05:01:55,550
I'm not gonna cry.

5758
05:01:56,070 --> 05:01:56,310
Meow.

5759
05:01:57,010 --> 05:01:57,610
But will you cry?

5760
05:01:58,230 --> 05:01:58,670
Woo!

5761
05:01:58,910 --> 05:02:00,210
Why don't you cry on my shoulder?

5762
05:02:00,410 --> 05:02:01,230
Stop saying cry.

5763
05:02:01,490 --> 05:02:01,730
I don't cry on my shoulder.

5764
05:02:02,070 --> 05:02:02,850
I know you wanna...

5765
05:02:03,390 --> 05:02:03,830
Woo!

5766
05:02:05,190 --> 05:02:06,010
Kitty's crying.

5767
05:02:06,270 --> 05:02:06,390
Meow!

5768
05:02:06,930 --> 05:02:07,590
Keep sitting.

5769
05:02:08,390 --> 05:02:08,830
Kitty-ay.

5770
05:02:08,990 --> 05:02:09,910
Kitty-ay.

5771
05:02:11,830 --> 05:02:12,590
She's pregnant.

5772
05:02:13,170 --> 05:02:13,350
Yeah.

5773
05:02:13,350 --> 05:02:13,850
I'm coming home.

5774
05:02:13,870 --> 05:02:14,470
She's pregnant.

5775
05:02:15,270 --> 05:02:16,250
You have an announcement.

5776
05:02:16,810 --> 05:02:18,750
I don't wanna spoil it, but I got a surprise for you.

5777
05:02:18,750 --> 05:02:19,450
He's pregnant!

5778
05:02:20,190 --> 05:02:21,150
He's pregnant!

5779
05:02:21,590 --> 05:02:21,930
Shut up!

5780
05:02:23,170 --> 05:02:24,390
No, no, no, Kitty-ay.

5781
05:02:24,470 --> 05:02:24,850
Not you.

5782
05:02:25,110 --> 05:02:25,550
Niko.

5783
05:02:25,810 --> 05:02:26,130
You know.

5784
05:02:26,310 --> 05:02:27,150
And her big mouth.

5785
05:02:31,450 --> 05:02:32,730
What the hell's your problem?

5786
05:02:32,910 --> 05:02:33,990
Where'd you learn to drive?

5787
05:02:36,150 --> 05:02:37,990
You gotta clean up the town.

5788
05:02:38,770 --> 05:02:40,030
Sorry, I gotta call you later.

5789
05:02:40,430 --> 05:02:41,790
Time to get back to work.

5790
05:02:42,010 --> 05:02:42,550
Mm-hmm.

5791
05:02:45,690 --> 05:02:47,330
You gotta clean up, Miro.

5792
05:02:47,510 --> 05:02:48,570
Didn't you learn anything?

5793
05:02:49,590 --> 05:02:51,110
I can't believe it.

5794
05:02:51,270 --> 05:02:52,290
He's pregnant!

5795
05:02:53,990 --> 05:02:55,090
Got an arm.

5796
05:02:55,310 --> 05:02:55,770
I'm good.

5797
05:02:56,090 --> 05:02:57,070
It's a prototype.

5798
05:02:57,070 --> 05:02:57,610
Oh.

5799
05:02:57,610 --> 05:02:59,710
And this is the perfect place to test it out.

5800
05:03:00,310 --> 05:03:01,550
Look, you're gonna use it...

5801
05:03:01,550 --> 05:03:01,950
Oh, no.

5802
05:03:02,250 --> 05:03:02,670
The timer.

5803
05:03:03,050 --> 05:03:03,330
Oh, God.

5804
05:03:03,450 --> 05:03:03,970
It's the timer.

5805
05:03:05,110 --> 05:03:05,470
Wait.

5806
05:03:05,590 --> 05:03:06,670
I have to pee so bad.

5807
05:03:06,670 --> 05:03:07,510
How sweet.

5808
05:03:08,830 --> 05:03:09,390
Ooh.

5809
05:03:12,150 --> 05:03:12,990
Feels good.

5810
05:03:13,270 --> 05:03:14,030
Feels good.

5811
05:03:18,850 --> 05:03:20,150
What are we listening to?

5812
05:03:20,910 --> 05:03:22,970
You'll get fixed as soon as we get back.

5813
05:03:23,110 --> 05:03:24,450
We're not listening to anything.

5814
05:03:25,990 --> 05:03:28,110
So, devils cry, huh?

5815
05:03:29,450 --> 05:03:31,030
Let's see what that sounds like!

5816
05:03:33,150 --> 05:03:33,710
Yeah!

5817
05:03:40,640 --> 05:03:42,340
Gotta let it out.

5818
05:03:44,900 --> 05:03:46,100
Oh, she's...

5819
05:03:48,620 --> 05:03:49,600
What's it do?

5820
05:03:49,840 --> 05:03:50,220
Wow!

5821
05:03:50,580 --> 05:03:51,540
Wait, there's so many...

5822
05:03:51,540 --> 05:03:51,640
Wait.

5823
05:03:51,800 --> 05:03:52,440
Press X?

5824
05:03:52,840 --> 05:03:53,760
What are you...

5825
05:03:53,760 --> 05:03:54,840
I can't read this...

5826
05:03:54,840 --> 05:03:56,360
I can't read this text!

5827
05:03:56,680 --> 05:03:58,160
I can't read this!

5828
05:03:58,360 --> 05:03:59,280
What the hell?

5829
05:04:00,100 --> 05:04:01,900
I can't read all of this!

5830
05:04:07,530 --> 05:04:08,550
Oh, my God!

5831
05:04:23,400 --> 05:04:24,680
You're not showing me!

5832
05:04:25,700 --> 05:04:27,080
I'm quick and I DT!

5833
05:04:35,250 --> 05:04:35,810
DT?

5834
05:04:36,030 --> 05:04:36,370
Nope.

5835
05:04:36,910 --> 05:04:37,970
Just do it.

5836
05:04:38,130 --> 05:04:39,030
Oh, when I have the wings.

5837
05:04:39,230 --> 05:04:39,370
Okay.

5838
05:04:39,850 --> 05:04:39,870
Oh.

5839
05:04:50,590 --> 05:04:52,090
I'm a double checker!

5840
05:04:55,470 --> 05:04:56,890
Just gonna tell you now, guys.

5841
05:04:57,070 --> 05:04:59,150
We're probably not gonna reach that timer, but...

5842
05:05:01,770 --> 05:05:02,170
Wait.

5843
05:05:02,370 --> 05:05:02,610
Come here.

5844
05:05:09,240 --> 05:05:10,040
Oh, it's gone.

5845
05:05:11,780 --> 05:05:12,840
Let me DT, please!

5846
05:05:23,480 --> 05:05:25,280
Oh, we can RT things, too?

5847
05:05:26,040 --> 05:05:26,920
Oh, my God!

5848
05:05:27,200 --> 05:05:28,200
I didn't even think about that!

5849
05:05:29,180 --> 05:05:29,580
I

5850
05:05:34,590 --> 05:05:35,670
forgot about the RT!

5851
05:05:41,420 --> 05:05:42,260
Wait, I did it?

5852
05:05:42,840 --> 05:05:43,920
I did it!

5853
05:05:44,980 --> 05:05:46,200
Guess that's the end, then.

5854
05:05:52,050 --> 05:05:54,230
So all we gotta do is cut this thing down.

5855
05:05:54,730 --> 05:05:55,330
That's right!

5856
05:05:57,750 --> 05:06:00,290
I'm more than capable of handling this on my own.

5857
05:06:01,090 --> 05:06:02,210
It's not over yet?

5858
05:06:02,330 --> 05:06:02,670
Oh, gosh.

5859
05:06:02,810 --> 05:06:02,910
Okay.

5860
05:06:03,030 --> 05:06:04,170
I could've peed so bad.

5861
05:06:04,370 --> 05:06:06,890
This game is not friendly to the small bladder.

5862
05:06:09,890 --> 05:06:11,490
But wait, there's more!

5863
05:06:12,230 --> 05:06:12,390
Okay.

5864
05:06:13,090 --> 05:06:13,570
Hi!

5865
05:06:15,950 --> 05:06:16,430
Hold!

5866
05:06:17,430 --> 05:06:17,910
Hold!

5867
05:06:19,750 --> 05:06:21,210
But these are not so bad.

5868
05:06:21,350 --> 05:06:22,310
These are kinda easy, right?

5869
05:06:23,350 --> 05:06:24,950
And we're doing it with Virgil.

5870
05:06:25,230 --> 05:06:25,970
That guy is...

5871
05:06:25,970 --> 05:06:27,050
That guy can handle his own.

5872
05:06:27,050 --> 05:06:28,510
They must be ready for that.

5873
05:06:29,130 --> 05:06:29,710
Uh, yeah.

5874
05:06:30,130 --> 05:06:30,870
Fine by me.

5875
05:06:31,350 --> 05:06:32,630
Let's give them what they want.

5876
05:06:33,430 --> 05:06:34,170
Oh, please.

5877
05:06:36,290 --> 05:06:37,210
Get all of them?

5878
05:06:37,730 --> 05:06:38,330
Yeah, oh.

5879
05:06:39,370 --> 05:06:40,530
Can I also DT?

5880
05:06:40,890 --> 05:06:41,190
No.

5881
05:06:41,490 --> 05:06:42,310
Or, uh, wait.

5882
05:06:42,510 --> 05:06:43,190
I guess I can.

5883
05:07:05,150 --> 05:07:05,830
Oh, shoot.

5884
05:07:08,230 --> 05:07:10,590
I can't see with all this text on the screen.

5885
05:07:11,410 --> 05:07:12,970
Are you doing anything, Virgil?

5886
05:07:13,590 --> 05:07:14,890
Are you doing your job?

5887
05:07:15,430 --> 05:07:16,270
I can't see.

5888
05:07:16,550 --> 05:07:17,170
Oh, there it is.

5889
05:07:17,270 --> 05:07:17,390
Okay.

5890
05:07:17,550 --> 05:07:17,830
It's going.

5891
05:07:19,190 --> 05:07:20,090
Oh, oh, shoot.

5892
05:07:22,810 --> 05:07:24,990
I can SDT, but how do I even know?

5893
05:07:32,890 --> 05:07:34,110
What are you doing over there?

5894
05:07:34,190 --> 05:07:35,430
Oh my gosh, I can't even move.

5895
05:07:36,190 --> 05:07:36,730
I can't.

5896
05:07:36,890 --> 05:07:38,050
I'm trying to get out of here.

5897
05:07:38,330 --> 05:07:39,030
I'm trying to get out of here.

5898
05:07:39,890 --> 05:07:41,430
Oh my god, please let me out.

5899
05:07:44,390 --> 05:07:46,290
Oh, oh, what did I switch to?

5900
05:07:49,550 --> 05:07:51,470
I somehow switched to...

5901
05:07:52,350 --> 05:07:52,950
the thing.

5902
05:07:56,490 --> 05:07:57,770
Oh, this might be good.

5903
05:07:58,670 --> 05:07:58,990
Woo, woo!

5904
05:08:01,010 --> 05:08:02,050
Stop blocking.

5905
05:08:04,410 --> 05:08:05,530
I can't see...

5906
05:08:08,770 --> 05:08:09,370
Yes.

5907
05:08:10,310 --> 05:08:11,610
Fight with Nero.

5908
05:08:11,890 --> 05:08:12,190
Okay.

5909
05:08:13,210 --> 05:08:13,690
I didn't.

5910
05:08:14,850 --> 05:08:15,610
It's okay.

5911
05:08:16,370 --> 05:08:17,170
It's okay.

5912
05:08:19,350 --> 05:08:20,370
Let me go pee.

5913
05:08:21,030 --> 05:08:22,190
Please, let me go pee.

5914
05:08:52,980 --> 05:08:54,320
whoops.

5915
05:09:06,290 --> 05:09:07,130
Yay!

5916
05:09:07,130 --> 05:09:07,290
Are you sorry?

5917
05:09:07,290 --> 05:09:08,750
That would're good.

5918
05:09:08,770 --> 05:09:08,870
How do we learn?

5919
05:09:10,830 --> 05:09:11,170
I...

5920
05:09:15,040 --> 05:09:15,940
A way?

5921
05:09:16,460 --> 05:09:21,320
Standing beside you.

5922
05:09:21,340 --> 05:09:27,200
There is no mountain too tall to overcome.

5923
05:09:28,740 --> 05:09:32,420
We will be as one.

5924
05:09:33,140 --> 05:09:36,840
You will rise again.

5925
05:09:38,020 --> 05:09:41,900
This is your legacy.

5926
05:09:58,810 --> 05:09:59,370
Ah!

5927
05:10:02,090 --> 05:10:03,310
I feel so much better.

5928
05:10:06,410 --> 05:10:08,090
Oh my goodness.

5929
05:10:09,910 --> 05:10:10,470
Wow.

5930
05:10:11,470 --> 05:10:13,090
I remember that place.

5931
05:10:16,810 --> 05:10:23,030
Should I wash your hands?

5932
05:10:23,210 --> 05:10:24,310
I always wash my hands.

5933
05:10:24,910 --> 05:10:26,410
Almost got that secret ending.

5934
05:10:26,410 --> 05:10:27,610
I don't know.

5935
05:10:27,810 --> 05:10:28,470
It's okay, though.

5936
05:10:30,010 --> 05:10:31,090
It's all good.

5937
05:10:36,510 --> 05:10:37,670
We did it.

5938
05:10:42,350 --> 05:10:43,250
We did it.

5939
05:10:43,410 --> 05:10:43,430
Oh.

5940
05:10:43,750 --> 05:10:47,230
I'm blocking her, but little Niko is behind her truck.

5941
05:10:47,330 --> 05:10:48,370
The truck is huge.

5942
05:10:49,890 --> 05:10:50,810
Can you see it?

5943
05:10:50,830 --> 05:10:52,570
I'm too... I'm blocking it.

5944
05:10:54,210 --> 05:10:54,790
There we go.

5945
05:10:54,830 --> 05:10:55,350
This is my leg.

5946
05:10:57,910 --> 05:10:58,750
This is my leg.

5947
05:10:58,810 --> 05:10:59,350
Oh, there they are.

5948
05:10:59,510 --> 05:11:00,050
Oh, look at them.

5949
05:11:00,150 --> 05:11:00,450
How cute.

5950
05:11:10,080 --> 05:11:12,020
I mean, the thing has a shower in there.

5951
05:11:12,200 --> 05:11:12,780
A workshop.

5952
05:11:14,160 --> 05:11:14,940
It's huge.

5953
05:11:16,840 --> 05:11:17,880
Well, she's tiny.

5954
05:11:21,420 --> 05:11:22,220
It's an RV.

5955
05:11:22,960 --> 05:11:23,320
Yeah.

5956
05:11:24,540 --> 05:11:24,900
RV.

5957
05:11:25,240 --> 05:11:25,880
I said truck.

5958
05:11:26,160 --> 05:11:26,620
I meant RV.

5959
05:11:46,410 --> 05:11:51,670
I don't recognize any of the names in the JP translation.

5960
05:11:52,210 --> 05:11:53,910
Or JP dub.

5961
05:11:55,980 --> 05:11:57,290
Who would you rather have as a dad?

5962
05:11:57,430 --> 05:11:58,790
Virgil or Angus Beef?

5963
05:12:00,990 --> 05:12:02,070
I don't know.

5964
05:12:05,120 --> 05:12:06,260
Moral of the story?

5965
05:12:06,680 --> 05:12:07,200
Use protection.

5966
05:12:07,440 --> 05:12:07,560
Yeah.

5967
05:12:07,820 --> 05:12:08,340
So true.

5968
05:12:10,340 --> 05:12:11,440
So true.

5969
05:12:12,640 --> 05:12:14,140
If you have a kid...

5970
05:12:14,140 --> 05:12:17,780
Pay the child support if you choose to abandon him.

5971
05:12:23,840 --> 05:12:25,380
Akio Otsuka was Morrison.

5972
05:12:25,520 --> 05:12:26,760
Wait, I didn't even see his name.

5973
05:12:27,080 --> 05:12:27,900
No way.

5974
05:12:28,240 --> 05:12:29,360
I was looking for him.

5975
05:12:29,420 --> 05:12:30,040
I'm not gonna lie.

5976
05:12:36,380 --> 05:12:37,640
I'm so tired.

5977
05:12:37,780 --> 05:12:38,620
My brain is mush.

5978
05:12:38,920 --> 05:12:41,900
I don't think I have the energy to drive to...

5979
05:12:43,680 --> 05:12:45,920
To drive to...

5980
05:12:45,920 --> 05:12:46,900
Yogurt.

5981
05:12:50,360 --> 05:12:52,500
Oh, boy.

5982
05:12:54,580 --> 05:12:56,800
Oh, son of Sparta.

5983
05:12:57,500 --> 05:12:58,820
Bloody palace.

5984
05:12:58,820 --> 05:12:59,780
No, thank you.

5985
05:13:02,020 --> 05:13:03,140
Recovery provocation.

5986
05:13:04,340 --> 05:13:06,540
Nero's demonic right arm has been restored.

5987
05:13:06,560 --> 05:13:07,780
And he can now both...

5988
05:13:07,780 --> 05:13:09,900
Use both devil bringer and devil trigger.

5989
05:13:10,160 --> 05:13:11,720
Wait, what about like...

5990
05:13:11,720 --> 05:13:13,480
What about tomboy?

5991
05:13:15,240 --> 05:13:19,260
Dante can equip rebellion, devil sword Sparta, or devil sword Dante.

5992
05:13:19,740 --> 05:13:20,680
Oh, my gosh.

5993
05:13:21,780 --> 05:13:22,720
Nico's reports...

5994
05:13:22,720 --> 05:13:27,540
Enemy reports have expanded to include photos capturing the moment of an enemy's defeat.

5995
05:13:27,700 --> 05:13:28,760
Oh, that's exciting.

5996
05:13:29,880 --> 05:13:31,640
You use all of it at once.

5997
05:13:32,360 --> 05:13:33,460
Costume changes.

5998
05:13:33,880 --> 05:13:35,260
The last costume you played...

5999
05:13:35,260 --> 05:13:37,100
Wait, I didn't change costumes, though.

6000
05:13:46,160 --> 05:13:47,920
I can use everything now.

6001
05:13:48,380 --> 05:13:50,140
Go get that yogurt, champ.

6002
05:13:50,380 --> 05:13:50,840
Thank you.

6003
05:13:51,320 --> 05:13:52,400
I'm so tired.

6004
05:14:02,240 --> 05:14:03,360
Wait, hold on.

6005
05:14:03,740 --> 05:14:05,040
There's a gallery, right?

6006
05:14:09,820 --> 05:14:10,700
Let me see.

6007
05:14:10,880 --> 05:14:11,860
Wait, did he have the wings?

6008
05:14:13,060 --> 05:14:14,120
No, shut up.

6009
05:14:18,170 --> 05:14:19,490
Wait, where's my...

6010
05:14:20,610 --> 05:14:21,590
Where's the gallery?

6011
05:14:23,850 --> 05:14:24,590
Main menu?

6012
05:14:24,630 --> 05:14:25,410
Oh, it wasn't there.

6013
05:14:26,410 --> 05:14:27,890
I was in the main menu.

6014
05:14:28,790 --> 05:14:29,870
Oh, here, here, here.

6015
05:14:30,050 --> 05:14:30,410
Okay, okay.

6016
05:14:32,010 --> 05:14:32,450
Gallery.

6017
05:14:33,010 --> 05:14:34,250
Oh, excuse me?

6018
05:14:37,790 --> 05:14:38,790
Everybody's here.

6019
05:14:39,050 --> 05:14:40,390
You are not welcome.

6020
05:14:41,130 --> 05:14:41,470
V.

6021
05:14:41,990 --> 05:14:43,910
You are unwelcome here.

6022
05:14:44,730 --> 05:14:46,010
Get out of here.

6023
05:14:46,450 --> 05:14:47,550
Get out of my car.

6024
05:14:54,040 --> 05:14:56,040
He pisses me off the most.

6025
05:14:58,480 --> 05:14:59,420
Nico's report.

6026
05:15:01,180 --> 05:15:02,560
Oh, my gosh.

6027
05:15:03,000 --> 05:15:03,740
Peter Thickups.

6028
05:15:03,820 --> 05:15:04,600
Thank you for the spooky.

6029
05:15:05,140 --> 05:15:05,880
Don't know.

6030
05:15:06,360 --> 05:15:06,960
Thank you.

6031
05:15:07,440 --> 05:15:09,980
I'm graduating from college on May 10th.

6032
05:15:10,700 --> 05:15:11,740
Well, congratulations.

6033
05:15:13,860 --> 05:15:14,660
Congratulations.

6034
05:15:14,660 --> 05:15:16,860
Sorry, I don't have more energy right now.

6035
05:15:21,380 --> 05:15:23,320
One-armed Nero.

6036
05:15:24,240 --> 05:15:25,040
Nero.

6037
05:15:27,500 --> 05:15:28,680
Restored Nero.

6038
05:15:29,420 --> 05:15:30,920
Wow, he's got an arm.

6039
05:15:31,760 --> 05:15:32,960
Devil-trigger Nero.

6040
05:15:33,140 --> 05:15:33,340
Whoa.

6041
05:15:35,800 --> 05:15:36,600
Wow.

6042
05:15:38,460 --> 05:15:39,420
Model Nero.

6043
05:15:39,480 --> 05:15:39,900
There we go.

6044
05:15:40,880 --> 05:15:41,240
Whoa.

6045
05:15:48,670 --> 05:15:49,310
Nice.

6046
05:15:50,030 --> 05:15:50,630
You can...

6047
05:15:50,630 --> 05:15:52,090
You can get a handful of that.

6048
05:15:54,250 --> 05:15:54,930
Dante.

6049
05:15:58,150 --> 05:15:59,210
Awakened Dante.

6050
05:16:01,170 --> 05:16:02,410
Hey, I'm Dante.

6051
05:16:02,950 --> 05:16:04,010
Hi, I'm Dante.

6052
05:16:04,010 --> 05:16:05,250
I just woke up.

6053
05:16:05,690 --> 05:16:06,450
Ha ha ha ha.

6054
05:16:07,630 --> 05:16:09,050
Devil-trigger Dante.

6055
05:16:10,150 --> 05:16:10,650
Shit.

6056
05:16:10,650 --> 05:16:11,530
Here we go.

6057
05:16:11,610 --> 05:16:12,010
Here we go.

6058
05:16:12,010 --> 05:16:13,490
This is the real pro...

6059
05:16:13,490 --> 05:16:14,050
God.

6060
05:16:14,470 --> 05:16:15,230
Golly.

6061
05:16:15,570 --> 05:16:15,830
Wait.

6062
05:16:16,110 --> 05:16:16,490
No, no, no.

6063
05:16:16,770 --> 05:16:17,610
Oh my god.

6064
05:16:18,410 --> 05:16:18,950
Wow.

6065
05:16:19,330 --> 05:16:19,850
Wow.

6066
05:16:20,230 --> 05:16:20,630
Wow.

6067
05:16:22,110 --> 05:16:22,870
Wow.

6068
05:16:22,870 --> 05:16:23,650
Oh, he's got...

6069
05:16:23,650 --> 05:16:24,290
Wow.

6070
05:16:24,810 --> 05:16:25,310
Wow.

6071
05:16:28,850 --> 05:16:29,610
Guys.

6072
05:16:31,570 --> 05:16:32,530
It's fine.

6073
05:16:34,410 --> 05:16:35,150
Guys.

6074
05:16:35,650 --> 05:16:36,390
Guys.

6075
05:16:37,770 --> 05:16:39,250
This is...

6076
05:16:40,690 --> 05:16:42,670
This might be the greatest...

6077
05:16:42,670 --> 05:16:43,890
Greatest...

6078
05:16:43,890 --> 05:16:45,270
Greatest bum...

6079
05:16:45,270 --> 05:16:46,890
In video gaming history.

6080
05:16:47,830 --> 05:16:48,250
Ha ha ha ha.

6081
05:16:52,440 --> 05:16:54,060
V is just...

6082
05:16:54,060 --> 05:16:54,480
Dying.

6083
05:16:54,900 --> 05:16:55,000
V.

6084
05:16:55,380 --> 05:16:55,900
Ha ha ha.

6085
05:16:56,900 --> 05:16:57,640
Yeah.

6086
05:16:58,080 --> 05:16:58,660
Oh, sorry.

6087
05:16:58,800 --> 05:16:59,020
Sorry.

6088
05:16:59,200 --> 05:16:59,320
Wait.

6089
05:16:59,600 --> 05:17:00,000
There we go.

6090
05:17:00,320 --> 05:17:00,760
Yeah.

6091
05:17:01,560 --> 05:17:02,040
Yeah.

6092
05:17:02,360 --> 05:17:02,900
You're dying.

6093
05:17:03,460 --> 05:17:04,020
Ha ha ha ha.

6094
05:17:04,840 --> 05:17:06,840
I didn't mean to zoom in on his crotch.

6095
05:17:07,340 --> 05:17:08,280
Ha ha ha.

6096
05:17:11,870 --> 05:17:12,350
Wait.

6097
05:17:12,430 --> 05:17:14,170
Do we have shower lady?

6098
05:17:15,050 --> 05:17:16,010
Lady Infantile.

6099
05:17:16,050 --> 05:17:16,510
Oh my god.

6100
05:17:16,530 --> 05:17:17,510
She's so cute.

6101
05:17:18,130 --> 05:17:18,590
Yeah.

6102
05:17:18,590 --> 05:17:20,230
My clothes look a little baggy on her.

6103
05:17:20,310 --> 05:17:22,490
But that's just because she's the scrawny type.

6104
05:17:22,950 --> 05:17:24,670
Don't mean I'm heavy or nothing.

6105
05:17:26,370 --> 05:17:27,870
She's so stinking cute.

6106
05:17:28,830 --> 05:17:29,070
Wait.

6107
05:17:29,110 --> 05:17:29,670
What's the difference?

6108
05:17:30,530 --> 05:17:31,570
Oh, clean face.

6109
05:17:33,310 --> 05:17:34,230
Oh my gosh.

6110
05:17:34,410 --> 05:17:35,050
She's so cute.

6111
05:17:37,330 --> 05:17:37,890
Waaah.

6112
05:17:39,770 --> 05:17:40,850
I love lady.

6113
05:17:41,290 --> 05:17:42,550
Look at her lips here.

6114
05:17:44,890 --> 05:17:45,110
Oh.

6115
05:17:47,550 --> 05:17:48,690
What about Trish?

6116
05:17:48,830 --> 05:17:49,350
Oh my gosh.

6117
05:17:49,490 --> 05:17:50,230
We even get Morrison.

6118
05:17:53,010 --> 05:17:53,970
We get...

6119
05:17:53,970 --> 05:17:55,870
We even get to see Morrison.

6120
05:17:56,850 --> 05:17:58,970
He's like, I got one look.

6121
05:17:59,270 --> 05:18:00,490
That's all I got.

6122
05:18:01,670 --> 05:18:03,810
I do wish her scar was a bit more visible.

6123
05:18:03,990 --> 05:18:05,310
I actually agree.

6124
05:18:06,350 --> 05:18:07,250
I agree.

6125
05:18:07,410 --> 05:18:07,790
I agree.

6126
05:18:08,830 --> 05:18:12,310
I wish her scar was a little bit more visible too.

6127
05:18:13,430 --> 05:18:13,690
Whoa.

6128
05:18:14,290 --> 05:18:15,770
Dante's looking very...

6129
05:18:16,890 --> 05:18:17,830
Castlevania here.

6130
05:18:19,710 --> 05:18:20,310
Ew.

6131
05:18:21,890 --> 05:18:23,050
Oh my gosh.

6132
05:18:23,050 --> 05:18:23,800
You're so cute.

6133
05:18:28,370 --> 05:18:29,450
You're so cute.

6134
05:18:29,750 --> 05:18:32,910
I think you skipped the post-credits scene.

6135
05:18:33,150 --> 05:18:33,270
Wait.

6136
05:18:33,650 --> 05:18:35,670
There's an actual post-credits scene?

6137
05:18:37,230 --> 05:18:38,750
I didn't skip anything though.

6138
05:18:39,150 --> 05:18:43,130
If you're talking about the secret ending, I...

6139
05:18:44,110 --> 05:18:44,650
Wait.

6140
05:18:44,870 --> 05:18:46,010
I didn't skip anything though.

6141
05:18:50,390 --> 05:18:54,270
But if you're talking about the secret one, I didn't get it because I failed the second part.

6142
05:19:00,100 --> 05:19:02,000
You have to beat Virgil in the last bit.

6143
05:19:02,360 --> 05:19:02,460
Yeah.

6144
05:19:02,540 --> 05:19:02,960
See guys?

6145
05:19:03,100 --> 05:19:03,720
I didn't get it.

6146
05:19:05,640 --> 05:19:06,040
So.

6147
05:19:07,540 --> 05:19:08,820
I did not get it.

6148
05:19:08,920 --> 05:19:09,820
I did not get it.

6149
05:19:09,920 --> 05:19:10,560
You skipped it.

6150
05:19:10,620 --> 05:19:11,700
I didn't press anything.

6151
05:19:12,500 --> 05:19:13,880
How could I have skipped it?

6152
05:19:13,980 --> 05:19:15,460
It took me straight back to the menu.

6153
05:19:15,460 --> 05:19:16,600
I didn't press anything.

6154
05:19:19,600 --> 05:19:20,840
You guys are being...

6155
05:19:20,840 --> 05:19:22,620
You guys are being a little much right now.

6156
05:19:22,620 --> 05:19:22,880
Okay?

6157
05:19:31,600 --> 05:19:32,900
You guys need to chill.

6158
05:19:33,060 --> 05:19:33,180
Okay?

6159
05:19:33,620 --> 05:19:34,460
You guys need to chill.

6160
05:19:44,320 --> 05:19:46,080
They're sad you didn't see it.

6161
05:19:46,720 --> 05:19:47,100
Yeah.

6162
05:19:47,680 --> 05:19:48,200
But...

6163
05:19:48,200 --> 05:19:49,160
Um...

6164
05:19:49,160 --> 05:19:50,020
It's okay.

6165
05:19:50,840 --> 05:19:52,660
I don't need to see it right now.

6166
05:19:53,320 --> 05:19:53,980
You know?

6167
05:19:54,660 --> 05:19:56,280
I don't need to see it right now.

6168
05:19:56,300 --> 05:19:56,860
It's okay.

6169
05:19:57,660 --> 05:19:58,620
It's all good.

6170
05:20:02,160 --> 05:20:03,240
Don't get one guy.

6171
05:20:03,300 --> 05:20:04,640
I was reading a super chat.

6172
05:20:05,000 --> 05:20:06,520
I just wanted to let them know.

6173
05:20:07,720 --> 05:20:08,060
Yeah.

6174
05:20:08,360 --> 05:20:08,560
Sorry.

6175
05:20:08,560 --> 05:20:10,400
I don't feel so well, you guys.

6176
05:20:13,120 --> 05:20:13,560
So.

6177
05:20:13,560 --> 05:20:15,020
That's why I'm kind of low energy.

6178
05:20:16,760 --> 05:20:18,500
But I just wanted to look through the art.

6179
05:20:30,630 --> 05:20:33,770
I like it better with her things on.

6180
05:20:34,110 --> 05:20:34,690
The...

6181
05:20:34,690 --> 05:20:35,110
What's it called?

6182
05:20:35,230 --> 05:20:36,190
Like all the...

6183
05:20:36,190 --> 05:20:37,810
I can't think anymore.

6184
05:20:39,030 --> 05:20:39,590
Virgil.

6185
05:20:39,770 --> 05:20:40,910
He looks sickly here.

6186
05:20:41,910 --> 05:20:42,810
The mommy.

6187
05:20:43,910 --> 05:20:44,590
Nightmare.

6188
05:20:45,510 --> 05:20:46,730
Nero and DT.

6189
05:20:49,490 --> 05:20:50,610
Her layers.

6190
05:20:50,930 --> 05:20:51,090
Yeah.

6191
05:20:51,270 --> 05:20:51,770
Her layers.

6192
05:20:55,690 --> 05:20:57,330
The music's putting me to sleep.

6193
05:21:00,250 --> 05:21:01,310
It's so chill.

6194
05:21:02,850 --> 05:21:03,330
Oh.

6195
05:21:07,030 --> 05:21:08,730
These guys are so sick looking.

6196
05:21:11,250 --> 05:21:11,730
Oh.

6197
05:21:11,870 --> 05:21:12,970
These are the...

6198
05:21:12,970 --> 05:21:13,150
This...

6199
05:21:13,690 --> 05:21:14,170
The...

6200
05:21:14,170 --> 05:21:15,330
This guy.

6201
05:21:15,490 --> 05:21:15,570
Yeah.

6202
05:21:15,730 --> 05:21:15,790
Yeah.

6203
05:21:16,550 --> 05:21:18,430
I was going to say the Grim Reaper looking guys.

6204
05:21:19,870 --> 05:21:20,490
Oh.

6205
05:21:20,630 --> 05:21:22,290
I never noticed the face changes.

6206
05:21:23,090 --> 05:21:23,630
That's neat.

6207
05:21:25,450 --> 05:21:25,810
This guy.

6208
05:21:25,930 --> 05:21:26,710
I like this guy.

6209
05:21:26,870 --> 05:21:27,190
He's cool.

6210
05:21:29,070 --> 05:21:29,270
Oh.

6211
05:21:30,250 --> 05:21:30,870
Wow.

6212
05:21:32,270 --> 05:21:33,130
Oh my gosh.

6213
05:21:33,130 --> 05:21:33,870
This is great.

6214
05:21:35,510 --> 05:21:35,950
Oh.

6215
05:21:37,730 --> 05:21:38,890
I liked...

6216
05:21:38,890 --> 05:21:40,030
That lady too.

6217
05:21:45,320 --> 05:21:45,940
Urinal.

6218
05:21:49,640 --> 05:21:50,260
Malthus.

6219
05:21:50,760 --> 05:21:52,200
Screw that bird.

6220
05:21:52,960 --> 05:21:54,260
Hate that bird.

6221
05:21:55,540 --> 05:21:56,820
Too much bird.

6222
05:21:57,460 --> 05:21:58,640
Not enough sexy lady.

6223
05:21:59,020 --> 05:21:59,360
It's like...

6224
05:21:59,360 --> 05:21:59,680
Oh my gosh.

6225
05:21:59,720 --> 05:22:00,560
It's just like before.

6226
05:22:01,200 --> 05:22:01,760
In...

6227
05:22:01,760 --> 05:22:02,160
In...

6228
05:22:02,160 --> 05:22:02,800
In four.

6229
05:22:05,060 --> 05:22:05,740
Except...

6230
05:22:05,740 --> 05:22:07,900
I feel like if we had a good amount of sexy lady.

6231
05:22:10,440 --> 05:22:11,600
What was...

6232
05:22:12,720 --> 05:22:13,400
Uh...

6233
05:22:14,160 --> 05:22:15,280
Chicken Jackie.

6234
05:22:16,780 --> 05:22:18,140
King Cerberus.

6235
05:22:23,670 --> 05:22:25,030
Blue Rose.

6236
05:22:26,990 --> 05:22:28,130
The V's came.

6237
05:22:30,490 --> 05:22:31,670
Ebony and Ivory.

6238
05:22:31,730 --> 05:22:33,890
I never knew that they had the pictures of...

6239
05:22:33,890 --> 05:22:35,230
The ladies on them.

6240
05:22:38,710 --> 05:22:39,390
No.

6241
05:22:39,510 --> 05:22:40,470
Not the plant lady.

6242
05:22:41,550 --> 05:22:42,230
Um...

6243
05:22:42,230 --> 05:22:42,810
The...

6244
05:22:42,810 --> 05:22:43,610
The fishy guy.

6245
05:22:44,090 --> 05:22:45,290
The angler fishy guy.

6246
05:22:47,810 --> 05:22:48,990
Oh my god.

6247
05:22:51,230 --> 05:22:53,230
Imagine being the one...

6248
05:22:53,230 --> 05:22:55,350
Who receives this image...

6249
05:22:55,350 --> 05:22:56,210
And they're just like...

6250
05:22:56,890 --> 05:22:58,230
Render that in 3D.

6251
05:22:59,690 --> 05:23:00,710
The frog!

6252
05:23:00,970 --> 05:23:01,070
Yeah.

6253
05:23:01,070 --> 05:23:01,770
He was a frog.

6254
05:23:05,330 --> 05:23:06,690
It was so gross.

6255
05:23:09,390 --> 05:23:11,190
Make this in 3D now.

6256
05:23:11,590 --> 05:23:12,970
Dr. Faust.

6257
05:23:16,650 --> 05:23:17,610
So many...

6258
05:23:17,610 --> 05:23:18,410
Small details.

6259
05:23:18,750 --> 05:23:19,630
Never even notice.

6260
05:23:22,770 --> 05:23:23,590
I'd quit.

6261
05:23:23,890 --> 05:23:24,490
Nah.

6262
05:23:25,510 --> 05:23:26,870
I believe in you.

6263
05:23:31,200 --> 05:23:32,160
Oh wow.

6264
05:23:32,420 --> 05:23:33,700
We get to see it when it's like...

6265
05:23:33,700 --> 05:23:34,300
Actually...

6266
05:23:34,300 --> 05:23:35,400
In motion.

6267
05:23:35,800 --> 05:23:36,400
Oh my god.

6268
05:23:36,400 --> 05:23:36,880
Oh my god.

6269
05:23:38,660 --> 05:23:39,100
Oh.

6270
05:23:41,360 --> 05:23:42,100
Helter Skelter.

6271
05:23:42,240 --> 05:23:42,480
Wow.

6272
05:23:42,960 --> 05:23:43,240
Oh see.

6273
05:23:43,320 --> 05:23:43,960
That's really cool.

6274
05:23:44,800 --> 05:23:45,420
You never...

6275
05:23:45,420 --> 05:23:46,480
I never thought about like...

6276
05:23:46,480 --> 05:23:47,580
How it looked when it was...

6277
05:23:47,580 --> 05:23:48,360
Like...

6278
05:23:48,360 --> 05:23:48,840
You know...

6279
05:23:48,840 --> 05:23:49,340
Being...

6280
05:23:49,340 --> 05:23:50,160
When it was working.

6281
05:23:52,200 --> 05:23:53,120
It's so fast.

6282
05:23:53,280 --> 05:23:54,060
Everything's so fast.

6283
05:23:56,360 --> 05:23:56,800
Gerbera.

6284
05:24:00,100 --> 05:24:02,160
Lulu from Final Fantasy X...

6285
05:24:02,160 --> 05:24:03,100
Has a dress made of bells.

6286
05:24:03,180 --> 05:24:03,460
Yeah.

6287
05:24:04,260 --> 05:24:04,960
Because like...

6288
05:24:04,960 --> 05:24:06,160
I wanted to see if the team...

6289
05:24:06,160 --> 05:24:07,080
Could render it in the game.

6290
05:24:07,300 --> 05:24:07,500
Oh.

6291
05:24:08,260 --> 05:24:09,280
That's so rude.

6292
05:24:09,380 --> 05:24:10,300
Like the guy...

6293
05:24:10,300 --> 05:24:10,620
Oh gosh.

6294
05:24:10,700 --> 05:24:11,160
What's his name?

6295
05:24:14,720 --> 05:24:15,320
Uh...

6296
05:24:15,320 --> 05:24:16,920
Kingdom Hearts.

6297
05:24:17,640 --> 05:24:18,120
Nomura.

6298
05:24:18,960 --> 05:24:19,560
Nomura.

6299
05:24:20,620 --> 05:24:21,880
That's so evil.

6300
05:24:24,440 --> 05:24:25,420
Design meeting.

6301
05:24:25,700 --> 05:24:25,940
Oh yeah.

6302
05:24:26,060 --> 05:24:27,960
I can totally interpret what that is.

6303
05:24:34,100 --> 05:24:34,700
Fancy.

6304
05:24:35,600 --> 05:24:37,440
We saw this for all of...

6305
05:24:37,440 --> 05:24:38,400
Two seconds.

6306
05:24:38,620 --> 05:24:39,680
Two seconds.

6307
05:24:40,760 --> 05:24:41,460
Oh.

6308
05:24:41,780 --> 05:24:42,260
That's cool.

6309
05:24:42,640 --> 05:24:43,940
That's so cool.

6310
05:24:48,890 --> 05:24:49,710
Wait.

6311
05:24:50,050 --> 05:24:51,070
It was their house?

6312
05:24:51,490 --> 05:24:52,610
The whole time.

6313
05:24:52,790 --> 05:24:53,210
I never...

6314
05:24:53,210 --> 05:24:54,050
Wow.

6315
05:24:58,380 --> 05:24:59,540
Oh my god.

6316
05:25:06,110 --> 05:25:08,030
That's such an awesome detail.

6317
05:25:13,760 --> 05:25:19,600
It's kind of crazy seeing how much more of the city gets destroyed over time.

6318
05:25:20,460 --> 05:25:21,180
Phantom.

6319
05:25:22,260 --> 05:25:22,980
That's me.

6320
05:25:24,760 --> 05:25:26,880
Nero looking like Eminem out in here.

6321
05:25:32,020 --> 05:25:33,080
Spider-Man.

6322
05:25:33,580 --> 05:25:35,060
I remember that part.

6323
05:25:36,300 --> 05:25:37,820
I remember that.

6324
05:25:38,780 --> 05:25:38,980
Ooh.

6325
05:25:41,220 --> 05:25:44,020
You played all DMC to save the DMC reboot.

6326
05:25:44,360 --> 05:25:45,340
Time for Bayonetta.

6327
05:25:46,720 --> 05:25:48,660
Gonna have to play him on Switch.

6328
05:25:49,440 --> 05:25:50,960
The Bayonetta eventually.

6329
05:25:56,880 --> 05:25:58,540
Remember all these areas.

6330
05:26:00,180 --> 05:26:02,800
Oh, that's so sad.

6331
05:26:04,680 --> 05:26:06,100
He's reaching out.

6332
05:26:06,820 --> 05:26:07,620
Little baby.

6333
05:26:08,440 --> 05:26:09,840
Little baby.

6334
05:26:12,800 --> 05:26:15,680
We got robbed of seeing baby Dante.

6335
05:26:17,320 --> 05:26:18,800
I remember that guy.

6336
05:26:20,220 --> 05:26:20,920
No.

6337
05:26:23,560 --> 05:26:25,900
Villa always looks so pathetic in these...

6338
05:26:25,900 --> 05:26:26,640
In these...

6339
05:26:28,020 --> 05:26:29,420
In these...

6340
05:26:29,420 --> 05:26:30,760
Concept art pieces.

6341
05:26:32,300 --> 05:26:34,600
Virgil was always just a traumatized kid.

6342
05:26:34,740 --> 05:26:36,700
Seeking power to protect and validate himself.

6343
05:26:39,860 --> 05:26:41,300
He's so tsundere.

6344
05:26:46,120 --> 05:26:46,820
Oh.

6345
05:26:48,300 --> 05:26:49,500
Moments before disaster.

6346
05:26:53,350 --> 05:26:54,640
I'm carrying me.

6347
05:27:01,410 --> 05:27:01,940
Nice.

6348
05:27:02,700 --> 05:27:03,360
Others.

6349
05:27:03,860 --> 05:27:04,320
Oh.

6350
05:27:04,600 --> 05:27:06,520
I want to talk to whoever...

6351
05:27:06,520 --> 05:27:07,160
Whoever...

6352
05:27:07,160 --> 05:27:08,240
What sicko...

6353
05:27:08,240 --> 05:27:10,060
What sicko...

6354
05:27:10,060 --> 05:27:11,080
Redesigned the...

6355
05:27:11,080 --> 05:27:13,040
The blorbs and the...

6356
05:27:14,100 --> 05:27:15,690
What sicko...

6357
05:27:15,920 --> 05:27:16,800
Redesigned these.

6358
05:27:20,300 --> 05:27:22,240
Roarb looks okay, I guess.

6359
05:27:22,460 --> 05:27:25,020
But the blorb is unforgivable.

6360
05:27:28,000 --> 05:27:29,320
But also...

6361
05:27:29,320 --> 05:27:31,260
Why is the gorb a cube?

6362
05:27:32,180 --> 05:27:34,400
And what the hell is a borb?

6363
05:27:34,600 --> 05:27:35,360
And the warb...

6364
05:27:37,860 --> 05:27:39,980
I think gorb goes kind of hard.

6365
05:27:40,760 --> 05:27:43,940
It looks like that one angel from Evangelion.

6366
05:27:45,060 --> 05:27:46,440
The blorb is insane.

6367
05:27:46,600 --> 05:27:47,380
It's so ugly.

6368
05:27:49,380 --> 05:27:50,620
Oh, it's so funny.

6369
05:27:51,520 --> 05:27:52,820
The porb is fine.

6370
05:27:53,040 --> 05:27:53,540
But the...

6371
05:27:53,540 --> 05:27:55,540
The warb is also horrible.

6372
05:27:56,440 --> 05:27:58,080
Y'all know I can watch the...

6373
05:27:58,080 --> 05:27:58,880
The anime.

6374
05:28:01,980 --> 05:28:04,940
The reboot and Netflix show aren't bad, but up to you if you want to watch them.

6375
05:28:05,000 --> 05:28:05,960
I do want to watch them.

6376
05:28:06,200 --> 05:28:07,140
Maybe I'll watch along.

6377
05:28:07,260 --> 05:28:07,460
We'll see.

6378
05:28:07,460 --> 05:28:09,680
Thank you, Mobjin, for the pink.

6379
05:28:09,820 --> 05:28:10,480
Thank you so much.

6380
05:28:10,980 --> 05:28:15,040
Love how everyone's chill with Virgil after he massacres the city for a second time.

6381
05:28:15,980 --> 05:28:16,980
This is just...

6382
05:28:16,980 --> 05:28:18,560
Devil may cry things.

6383
05:28:19,340 --> 05:28:22,100
You know, baby Dante had Sparta's haircut.

6384
05:28:22,840 --> 05:28:23,160
Whoa.

6385
05:28:24,700 --> 05:28:27,240
Those orbs would make a great fruit snack design.

6386
05:28:27,720 --> 05:28:28,920
They would!

6387
05:28:30,880 --> 05:28:32,180
Warb is a mood.

6388
05:28:32,580 --> 05:28:34,260
That's how I feel right now.

6389
05:28:35,780 --> 05:28:37,700
Who had crazier brother complex?

6390
05:28:37,820 --> 05:28:38,620
Virgil or Liquid?

6391
05:28:43,900 --> 05:28:47,700
I think if Liquid had the power...

6392
05:28:49,400 --> 05:28:51,780
To do what Virgil could, he would.

6393
05:28:53,060 --> 05:28:53,580
I

6394
05:29:01,090 --> 05:29:01,730
don't think...

6395
05:29:01,730 --> 05:29:04,930
Virgil didn't do everything that he did to get back at Dante.

6396
05:29:05,390 --> 05:29:07,070
But Liquid totally did.

6397
05:29:10,070 --> 05:29:13,630
Liquid totally was just like, yeah, I'm going to get back at...

6398
05:29:13,630 --> 05:29:14,770
My brother.

6399
05:29:15,610 --> 05:29:17,010
With the better genes.

6400
05:29:18,070 --> 05:29:20,230
That he didn't actually have.

6401
05:29:22,190 --> 05:29:22,990
There's a manga.

6402
05:29:23,130 --> 05:29:23,630
Yeah, yeah.

6403
05:29:23,750 --> 05:29:24,710
Someone told me about it earlier.

6404
05:29:25,830 --> 05:29:26,870
The Harvested.

6405
05:29:27,810 --> 05:29:28,150
Yeah.

6406
05:29:28,390 --> 05:29:28,910
Oh, yeah.

6407
05:29:28,910 --> 05:29:31,590
Those were a bunch of dead people that we definitely saw...

6408
05:29:31,590 --> 05:29:32,410
In the city.

6409
05:29:33,030 --> 05:29:35,370
Like, the whole city just pretty much got obliterated.

6410
05:29:38,650 --> 05:29:40,470
Wait, are we going to see the little...

6411
05:29:40,470 --> 05:29:41,310
Oh, gosh.

6412
05:29:41,650 --> 05:29:45,350
This game is horrible for anybody that has that fear of...

6413
05:29:45,350 --> 05:29:46,110
Of holes.

6414
05:29:46,750 --> 05:29:47,530
The trypophobia.

6415
05:29:48,650 --> 05:29:50,170
This game is horrible.

6416
05:29:50,810 --> 05:29:52,470
For anybody with that.

6417
05:29:52,870 --> 05:29:54,110
Liquid was in an arm.

6418
05:29:54,250 --> 05:29:55,470
Virgil removed an arm.

6419
05:30:00,970 --> 05:30:04,030
Everybody who had a vacation from the city.

6420
05:30:05,870 --> 05:30:06,650
We're lucky.

6421
05:30:06,810 --> 05:30:07,090
Congrats.

6422
05:30:07,150 --> 05:30:07,790
I'm beating the game.

6423
05:30:07,930 --> 05:30:08,370
Thank you.

6424
05:30:09,030 --> 05:30:10,190
I think you're also...

6425
05:30:10,990 --> 05:30:14,530
The first streamer I've seen actually win the Nero time challenge at the end.

6426
05:30:15,030 --> 05:30:16,150
Wait, I didn't win though.

6427
05:30:17,550 --> 05:30:19,030
I didn't win it.

6428
05:30:21,050 --> 05:30:22,150
I did it.

6429
05:30:22,550 --> 05:30:24,150
Oh, the Nero one.

6430
05:30:24,290 --> 05:30:24,870
I won Nero.

6431
05:30:25,030 --> 05:30:25,530
Sorry, you're right.

6432
05:30:25,910 --> 05:30:27,070
Sorry, I was thinking Virgil.

6433
05:30:28,150 --> 05:30:29,810
I did win Nero's part.

6434
05:30:30,170 --> 05:30:30,450
Yeah.

6435
05:30:30,730 --> 05:30:31,550
I did that.

6436
05:30:32,350 --> 05:30:33,390
I did that.

6437
05:30:33,730 --> 05:30:34,850
I did win Nero's.

6438
05:30:35,970 --> 05:30:37,190
We take those.

6439
05:30:40,110 --> 05:30:41,390
We take those.

6440
05:30:52,820 --> 05:30:53,360
Jukebox.

6441
05:30:55,160 --> 05:30:56,140
Public enemy.

6442
05:30:58,440 --> 05:30:58,980
Ultraviolet.

6443
05:30:59,500 --> 05:31:00,460
Lock and load.

6444
05:31:01,160 --> 05:31:01,800
Fire away.

6445
05:31:01,960 --> 05:31:02,940
So many that I didn't get.

6446
05:31:04,420 --> 05:31:06,540
Devil May Cry 3, 2...

6447
05:31:06,540 --> 05:31:06,960
Oh, wait.

6448
05:31:07,040 --> 05:31:07,560
I just noticed.

6449
05:31:08,160 --> 05:31:09,120
Oh, my God.

6450
05:31:09,880 --> 05:31:10,240
Oh, my God.

6451
05:31:11,020 --> 05:31:12,200
That's so fun.

6452
05:31:12,820 --> 05:31:14,160
Stylish voice.

6453
05:31:15,580 --> 05:31:15,960
Hey.

6454
05:31:20,160 --> 05:31:21,640
Never mind.

6455
05:31:25,080 --> 05:31:26,200
Wait.

6456
05:31:27,180 --> 05:31:29,680
It literally says bye.

6457
05:31:30,280 --> 05:31:31,820
Oh, you're kidding me.

6458
05:31:32,820 --> 05:31:33,340
Wow.

6459
05:31:33,840 --> 05:31:34,420
Okay.

6460
05:31:37,320 --> 05:31:37,880
Wow.

6461
05:31:44,670 --> 05:31:50,910
Yeah, I don't think I ever won the timed challenges at the end ever before in any of the other games.

6462
05:31:51,290 --> 05:31:54,890
So, being able to get the one was nice, at least.

6463
05:31:56,090 --> 05:32:01,110
I will look up the ending.

6464
05:32:02,830 --> 05:32:04,490
And we can watch it together.

6465
05:32:04,490 --> 05:32:05,630
The one that I missed.

6466
05:32:06,330 --> 05:32:07,710
We'll watch it together.

6467
05:32:11,030 --> 05:32:12,270
And, uh...

6468
05:32:13,190 --> 05:32:13,810
Yeah.

6469
05:32:14,390 --> 05:32:14,930
Let me see.

6470
05:32:15,010 --> 05:32:15,310
Hold on.

6471
05:32:16,050 --> 05:32:20,650
Devil May Cry 5, secret ending.

6472
05:32:30,200 --> 05:32:30,760
Uh...

6473
05:32:30,760 --> 05:32:33,100
Let me just make sure...

6474
05:32:33,100 --> 05:32:34,520
Did I say smake sure?

6475
05:32:36,500 --> 05:32:38,420
Let me make sure these are good, you know?

6476
05:32:40,780 --> 05:32:41,700
Thank you, Jay!

6477
05:32:44,040 --> 05:32:45,540
Congrats on completing another game.

6478
05:32:45,660 --> 05:32:46,520
29 games to go.

6479
05:32:46,640 --> 05:32:47,700
28 if you count Visage.

6480
05:32:48,140 --> 05:32:48,780
Oh, yeah.

6481
05:32:48,860 --> 05:32:50,500
I guess I can count that, huh?

6482
05:32:51,560 --> 05:32:53,760
Why does this one feel so squished?

6483
05:32:54,620 --> 05:32:55,260
Hold on.

6484
05:32:56,140 --> 05:32:57,840
Let me try this instant.

6485
05:33:03,700 --> 05:33:04,180
Uh...

6486
05:33:06,580 --> 05:33:07,200
Fake me!

6487
05:33:07,320 --> 05:33:07,880
Thank you!

6488
05:33:08,620 --> 05:33:11,060
Not only did you beat the MC5, but the whole series.

6489
05:33:11,700 --> 05:33:12,580
Thank you!

6490
05:33:14,060 --> 05:33:15,380
Now, we beat the whole game.

6491
05:33:15,980 --> 05:33:16,240
Me.

6492
05:33:16,580 --> 05:33:19,300
I'm not a fighting game person ever.

6493
05:33:20,440 --> 05:33:22,580
And somehow, I brute force my way through.

6494
05:33:24,680 --> 05:33:25,160
Somehow.

6495
05:33:27,140 --> 05:33:28,340
Somehow, I brute force.

6496
05:33:30,760 --> 05:33:32,360
Special edition new ending.

6497
05:33:32,580 --> 05:33:34,080
I can't tell which one of these is.

6498
05:33:34,180 --> 05:33:35,560
The thing to watch.

6499
05:33:36,300 --> 05:33:37,400
I'll be honest.

6500
05:33:38,020 --> 05:33:39,180
I can't tell.

6501
05:33:42,060 --> 05:33:43,300
They're all giving me...

6502
05:33:44,640 --> 05:33:45,240
There's...

6503
05:33:49,460 --> 05:33:50,420
Watch them both.

6504
05:33:50,560 --> 05:33:51,520
No, there's like so...

6505
05:33:51,520 --> 05:33:52,280
It's like...

6506
05:33:52,280 --> 05:33:54,320
This is showing me all endings.

6507
05:33:54,360 --> 05:33:55,940
And it's 15 minutes long.

6508
05:33:57,780 --> 05:33:58,380
Congratulations.

6509
05:33:58,920 --> 05:33:59,360
Thank you!

6510
05:33:59,720 --> 05:34:00,260
Fourth warp!

6511
05:34:01,420 --> 05:34:02,280
Thank you.

6512
05:34:03,280 --> 05:34:05,640
Let me try after credits scene.

6513
05:34:06,120 --> 05:34:08,060
Instead, after credits.

6514
05:34:14,840 --> 05:34:16,520
Post credits scene.

6515
05:34:17,540 --> 05:34:21,040
Okay, this looks like it might be it.

6516
05:34:21,880 --> 05:34:24,220
It's 3 minutes 32 seconds.

6517
05:34:24,380 --> 05:34:25,700
Let me make sure that I don't...

6518
05:34:30,490 --> 05:34:32,170
Does it start with lady?

6519
05:34:36,140 --> 05:34:37,820
Gotta let it out.

6520
05:34:39,940 --> 05:34:40,500
Yeah?

6521
05:34:40,820 --> 05:34:40,940
Okay.

6522
05:34:41,260 --> 05:34:42,100
I'm gonna quit the game.

6523
05:34:45,800 --> 05:34:46,860
So that...

6524
05:34:46,860 --> 05:34:48,200
It's not playing in the background.

6525
05:34:48,580 --> 05:34:49,640
And let me pull it up.

6526
05:34:52,440 --> 05:34:53,860
Let me pull it up.

6527
05:35:00,000 --> 05:35:01,620
I'm so hungry.

6528
05:35:02,320 --> 05:35:04,380
Oh, I'm so hungry.

6529
05:35:04,980 --> 05:35:05,940
Let's see.

6530
05:35:07,140 --> 05:35:07,960
Hold on.

6531
05:35:08,080 --> 05:35:08,780
I'm gonna do this.

6532
05:35:15,440 --> 05:35:17,340
I'm cropping it right now.

6533
05:35:20,380 --> 05:35:20,700
And...

6534
05:35:29,090 --> 05:35:30,070
Okay, that should be good.

6535
05:35:30,790 --> 05:35:31,230
Oh, wait.

6536
05:35:31,330 --> 05:35:32,910
I didn't check to see if I can hear anybody.

6537
05:35:36,770 --> 05:35:37,590
No, it seems okay.

6538
05:35:38,070 --> 05:35:38,330
Okay.

6539
05:35:38,850 --> 05:35:39,170
Alright.

6540
05:35:41,590 --> 05:35:42,650
Uh, we watch.

6541
05:35:47,460 --> 05:35:49,280
Oh, let me get my head out of the way.

6542
05:35:59,770 --> 05:36:00,570
There we go.

6543
05:36:11,630 --> 05:36:13,430
A few weeks later.

6544
05:36:13,990 --> 05:36:14,550
July...

6545
05:36:14,550 --> 05:36:15,490
Pizza!

6546
05:36:19,190 --> 05:36:20,790
Too bad it's not Pizza Friday.

6547
05:36:21,070 --> 05:36:21,190
Wow.

6548
05:36:21,710 --> 05:36:22,830
No sign of them.

6549
05:36:23,350 --> 05:36:23,890
Nothing.

6550
05:36:25,570 --> 05:36:26,130
Hmm.

6551
05:36:26,130 --> 05:36:26,270
Hmm.

6552
05:36:27,410 --> 05:36:27,850
Yeah.

6553
05:36:28,630 --> 05:36:29,050
Yeah.

6554
05:36:29,630 --> 05:36:29,770
Haha.

6555
05:36:30,290 --> 05:36:31,710
Then can I have this office?

6556
05:36:32,570 --> 05:36:35,850
Because I've been thinking it's almost time for me to settle down somewhere.

6557
05:36:36,850 --> 05:36:37,170
Hmm.

6558
05:36:38,070 --> 05:36:38,430
No.

6559
05:36:38,670 --> 05:36:39,770
I don't think so.

6560
05:36:39,950 --> 05:36:41,050
The girls are growing.

6561
05:36:42,390 --> 05:36:42,910
Oh.

6562
05:36:42,990 --> 05:36:43,230
Oh.

6563
05:36:43,530 --> 05:36:44,050
Oh.

6564
05:36:44,050 --> 05:36:47,650
I hate to spoil your dreams, ladies, but that shit ain't gonna happen.

6565
05:36:47,870 --> 05:36:48,170
Oh.

6566
05:36:48,270 --> 05:36:49,110
What do you mean, Morrison?

6567
05:36:50,230 --> 05:36:51,490
They're shutting off the lights.

6568
05:36:51,670 --> 05:36:53,850
See, there's a thing to this place, and I have it.

6569
05:36:54,010 --> 05:36:54,310
Oh.

6570
05:36:54,750 --> 05:36:55,990
Why do you...

6571
05:36:55,990 --> 05:36:58,570
Clever little devil came to see me right before his last job.

6572
05:36:58,710 --> 05:37:04,030
Said something like, My dearest friend, I know you'll keep this safe because them crazy bitches...

6573
05:37:07,250 --> 05:37:08,770
Did I say crazy bitches?

6574
05:37:08,910 --> 05:37:10,150
I'm sorry, I meant ladies.

6575
05:37:10,490 --> 05:37:12,510
Anyway, the rest of the story is not important.

6576
05:37:12,610 --> 05:37:14,250
No, that's definitely what Dante said.

6577
05:37:14,630 --> 05:37:16,390
I wonder if he even plans on coming back.

6578
05:37:16,590 --> 05:37:17,350
Got me.

6579
05:37:17,710 --> 05:37:20,850
What is important is I have a job for you two.

6580
05:37:21,210 --> 05:37:21,650
Ooh.

6581
05:37:30,070 --> 05:37:32,230
Lady is so stinking cute.

6582
05:37:32,490 --> 05:37:33,190
My goodness.

6583
05:37:46,930 --> 05:37:47,990
Oh my god.

6584
05:37:48,190 --> 05:37:49,070
Give it a rest.

6585
05:37:53,570 --> 05:37:55,810
Give it a rest.

6586
05:37:56,690 --> 05:37:57,990
They're bonding.

6587
05:38:00,050 --> 05:38:01,510
score for Dante.

6588
05:38:02,030 --> 05:38:03,070
I'm up one.

6589
05:38:03,650 --> 05:38:04,990
Way did you learn to count.

6590
05:38:06,130 --> 05:38:06,930
We're even.

6591
05:38:10,510 --> 05:38:16,430
You know, I'm starting to think this is never going to end.

6592
05:38:18,450 --> 05:38:19,030
Maybe.

6593
05:38:21,990 --> 05:38:23,450
We got plenty of time.

6594
05:38:33,430 --> 05:38:34,950
Why, why even?

6595
05:38:35,190 --> 05:38:35,830
What's the boy?

6596
05:38:38,950 --> 05:38:40,530
Thank you, Outsu.

6597
05:38:46,230 --> 05:38:47,750
Because they like to.

6598
05:38:50,710 --> 05:38:52,090
I know those guys.

6599
05:39:04,540 --> 05:39:05,760
That's a good visual.

6600
05:39:06,080 --> 05:39:07,940
I don't care what this person's points are.

6601
05:39:09,860 --> 05:39:10,400
Jackpot.

6602
05:39:11,300 --> 05:39:13,220
That's such a good visual right here.

6603
05:39:14,760 --> 05:39:15,820
Oh, not that.

6604
05:39:17,340 --> 05:39:18,200
Right there.

6605
05:39:23,200 --> 05:39:23,740
Woohoo!

6606
05:39:24,440 --> 05:39:28,680
Oh my gosh, I love that there's a video called Devil May Cry All Lady and Trish cutscenes.

6607
05:39:30,100 --> 05:39:31,140
So real.

6608
05:39:31,380 --> 05:39:32,600
So true.

6609
05:39:33,220 --> 05:39:34,240
So valid.

6610
05:39:35,940 --> 05:39:36,520
Yeah!

6611
05:39:38,500 --> 05:39:39,360
I know.

6612
05:39:39,980 --> 05:39:40,800
This pit goes hard.

6613
05:39:40,920 --> 05:39:41,420
It does!

6614
05:39:41,740 --> 05:39:42,760
It goes so hard.

6615
05:39:46,020 --> 05:39:46,920
Okay, guys.

6616
05:39:47,040 --> 05:39:47,880
I'm so hungry.

6617
05:39:48,220 --> 05:39:49,260
I'm so tired.

6618
05:39:50,080 --> 05:39:52,320
I might be able to make it to yogurt.

6619
05:39:52,920 --> 05:39:55,340
But I gotta eat it first if I want to try.

6620
05:39:56,000 --> 05:39:56,940
So thank you!

6621
05:40:00,360 --> 05:40:02,000
For Devil May Cry.

6622
05:40:03,680 --> 05:40:06,240
We'll see about the MC Devil May Cry.

6623
05:40:06,440 --> 05:40:07,120
I still don't know yet.

6624
05:40:07,300 --> 05:40:11,380
But I'm still feeling a little bleh.

6625
05:40:13,720 --> 05:40:19,820
So I think I just need to rest having having double Devil May Cry.

6626
05:40:19,980 --> 05:40:24,940
This game drains me so much in having it two days in a row.

6627
05:40:26,300 --> 05:40:26,700
Oh!

6628
05:40:26,700 --> 05:40:27,100
Oh!

6629
05:40:27,100 --> 05:40:29,840
Has made me... Oh, I feel like I ran a marathon.

6630
05:40:32,080 --> 05:40:34,000
I feel like I've ran a marathon.

6631
05:40:36,300 --> 05:40:37,560
We trying the reboot too?

6632
05:40:37,840 --> 05:40:40,000
Maybe just to say that I've tried it.

6633
05:40:40,160 --> 05:40:41,540
I know that it has mixed feelings.

6634
05:40:44,500 --> 05:40:51,160
But I'm a bit of a completionist in terms of trying stuff and saying that I've tried it.

6635
05:40:51,600 --> 05:40:52,980
I don't want to have... I don't want to give anybody...

6636
05:40:52,980 --> 05:40:57,840
Any time someone's just like, oh, well, you didn't play such and such.

6637
05:40:57,920 --> 05:40:58,600
I'll be like, yeah.

6638
05:40:59,140 --> 05:40:59,740
I did.

6639
05:41:01,020 --> 05:41:01,760
I did.

6640
05:41:04,200 --> 05:41:06,420
Be safe, Mito, if you go get yogurt.

6641
05:41:07,020 --> 05:41:08,220
I'm already dead.

6642
05:41:08,440 --> 05:41:08,860
It's okay.

6643
05:41:11,320 --> 05:41:12,320
Thank you, guys!

6644
05:41:12,740 --> 05:41:13,480
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

6645
05:41:13,780 --> 05:41:17,040
I will see you guys... When I see you next!

6646
05:41:18,060 --> 05:41:18,860
Thank you!

6647
05:41:19,180 --> 05:41:19,960
Thank you, thank you!

6648
05:41:20,200 --> 05:41:20,640
Bye bye!

6649
05:41:22,180 --> 05:41:22,840
See you!

6650
05:41:23,120 --> 05:41:23,680
Bye bye!
