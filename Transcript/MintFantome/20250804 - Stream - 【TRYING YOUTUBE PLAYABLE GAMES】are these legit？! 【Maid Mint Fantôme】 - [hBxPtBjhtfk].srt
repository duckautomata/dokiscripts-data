1
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,230
Hello, this is the first sentence!

2
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,790
Did you guys know that?

3
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,590
The other day it was Steinskate Day.

4
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,170
I should add tooturu.

5
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,190
An honor.

6
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,210
There was like a whole...

7
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,590
There was like a whole display...

8
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,170
Akihabara Don Quijote and everything.

9
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,850
Saw it on Twitter?

10
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,510
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,950
There was like pictures and stuff.

12
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,310
They decorated...

13
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,550
If you know the Akihabara Don Quijote.

14
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,370
How there's like the pictures on the sides of the escalator when you go up.

15
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,930
They decorated it with Steinskate pictures and stuff.

16
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,650
Did you go?

17
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,910
I'm not in Japan.

18
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,270
Yeah, they made it an official day.

19
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,070
The Steinskate.

20
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,470
Is the cafe still going?

21
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,110
The maid cafe?

22
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:40,990
Yeah.

23
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,130
Yes, yes.

24
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,870
And Bunny Day.

25
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,510
And Bunny Day.

26
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,130
Bunny Day was...

27
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,390
Yesterday?

28
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,530
I think...

29
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,360
Quite disappointed.

30
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,460
I saw like...

31
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,520
Barely any bunny girls on my feed.

32
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,700
I think I...

33
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,340
My...

34
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
My Twitter is...

35
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,080
Broke.

36
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,960
It's okay.

37
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,000
I saw no bunny girls.

38
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,240
Like one.

39
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,080
That's it.

40
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,600
Unacceptable.

41
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,500
I know.

42
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,260
How?

43
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,340
I don't know.

44
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,440
Actually, maybe I wasn't also on Twitter very much.

45
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,960
Can't believe you are willing to endanger your whole PC integrity just to entertain us.

46
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,380
I don't think these are...

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,480
Mal?

48
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,280
They might be mining crypto.

49
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
But I think...

50
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,460
But I...

51
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't think they're gonna give me a virus.

52
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,420
Bunny suit...

53
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,040
When?

54
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,640
Kind of want one.

55
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,340
I'm sure...

56
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,260
I haven't thought about...

57
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,040
What outfit to do after...

58
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,340
My next one.

59
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,660
So I don't know.

60
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Only one way to find out.

61
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah!

62
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,080
Today we'll be playing YouTube games.

63
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,120
Wowie.

64
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,080
Wowie.

65
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,680
Wowie.

66
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,760
Have you guys ever played...

67
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,900
Okay.

68
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,340
Wait.

69
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,940
Raise your hand if you have played a YouTube game before.

70
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,820
The playables.

71
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
Raise your hand.

72
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,700
Raise your hand.

73
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,900
Oh, I did think about a pirate.

74
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm not gonna lie.

75
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:34,740
No.

76
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:35,960
Never.

77
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,000
Once.

78
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,920
Happy International Friendship Day.

79
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,100
Bunny girl Minto would be so cute.

80
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,140
Rascal does not dream of...

81
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,460
Bunny girl Minto.

82
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,220
You've played multiple.

83
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,940
That checks out, Orca.

84
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Famous last words.

85
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,380
I don't think they can be a virus.

86
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,080
Here's a donation to the...

87
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,340
They're literally...

88
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,220
I don't think...

89
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,140
YouTube would be shut down if these had viruses.

90
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:03,480
No?

91
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,980
You look like an animated sticker.

92
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,340
What would an...

93
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,840
What's an animated sticker face that I could...

94
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,800
Er...

95
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,960
Er...

96
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,480
Ehhh...

97
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,300
Undi...

98
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,960
Echi!

99
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,840
I see...

100
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,250
I want to kind of make a cat clock.

101
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,530
Actually, that was like... That was like some merch that I wanted to work on.

102
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,530
Was I want to make a cat clock?

103
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,950
Like, you know, the... The ones that the eyes go...

104
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,950
But with like that face?

105
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,710
Do you know what I'm talking about?

106
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,010
Maybe one day.

107
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,870
Maybe one day.

108
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,890
And a moving tail.

109
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
I guess it would have to be...

110
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,860
My new...

111
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,760
Outfit with the tail.

112
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,500
Only if it screams death penalty as you are.

113
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,420
Right.

114
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,640
Okay, I'll stay.

115
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
I'll stay twin tail now.

116
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,620
Talisman, thank you so much for the vibe.

117
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,780
Thank you!

118
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,980
And...

119
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,300
Fluffy!

120
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,300
Welcome to membership!

121
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,520
Thank you!

122
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,480
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

123
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,980
Welcome back, everybody.

124
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,580
We'll...

125
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,780
Welcome back to...

126
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,280
Wait...

127
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,060
To...

128
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,880
To...

129
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,160
Mem...

130
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,760
Mem...

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,780
But, um...

132
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,100
Yeah, so we'll be playing these today.

133
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:38,760
I...

134
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,380
Look at all this.

135
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,540
We could strike gold in here.

136
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,620
There's attack hole.

137
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,720
There's solar smash.

138
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,660
This one I see all the time.

139
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,660
Tall man run.

140
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,380
What is dig deep?

141
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,380
Fashion battle?

142
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,920
Fork and sausage.

143
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,120
Fork and sausage.

144
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,480
Oh!

145
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,620
I see ads for the color water sort!

146
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,920
Yes!

147
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:04,620
Yes!

148
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,360
I see ads for games like...

149
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,860
These look like the ones that are like those mobile games that probably have a ton of ads.

150
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,380
And so these...

151
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,620
Parking Jam!

152
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,400
That's another one I've gotten ads for.

153
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,520
So these probably...

154
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,380
If they have...

155
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,760
If they don't have ads...

156
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,660
They're already...

157
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,020
Superior to...

158
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,860
Getting the app, no?

159
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,600
Or getting...

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,280
I like...

161
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,460
State.io Words of wonders!

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,040
Wait, I've seen this ad too!

163
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,040
Solar smash is genuinely so peak?

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,740
No way.

165
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,620
We're on your case soon, Mito!

166
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,920
Apparently, the original song artist saw your announcement...

167
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,540
I know!

168
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,620
Ayoban!

169
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,640
Saw...

170
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,360
Saw my tweet!

171
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm kind of nervous.

172
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,180
Uh...

173
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,620
Nimmi...

174
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,040
Nimmi messaged me and she's like...

175
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,560
Do you want to...

176
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,160
So originally, I wasn't gonna...

177
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,380
Have it like...

178
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,280
Release...

179
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,060
For 400k...

180
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,540
But I was like...

181
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,020
I don't have anything for 400k...

182
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,760
So...

183
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Maybe I could just release it for then...

184
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,360
Maybe it'll motivate people to subscribe...

185
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,900
Subscribe!

186
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,460
Subscribe!

187
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,880
And um...

188
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,280
And uh...

189
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,240
So I like...

190
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,420
Like...

191
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,600
And then Nimmi messaged me and she's like...

192
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,520
Do you want to do a countdown stream together?

193
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,700
So...

194
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,740
Um...

195
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,620
Probably...

196
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,940
Do that...

197
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,920
Eventually...

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Though...

199
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,860
I...

200
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,340
I kind of worry about the music video...

201
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,000
Um...

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,560
I thought it would be...

203
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,640
Done sooner...

204
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,360
But it might be done a little bit later...

205
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
So I apologize...

206
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,280
I got ahead of...

207
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,660
I got ahead of myself...

208
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,500
I think...

209
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,180
Um...

210
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,980
But...

211
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,920
Should be out...

212
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,820
Soon TM!

213
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,780
I fear...

214
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,340
I fear...

215
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,750
Many of my things have been...

216
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,020
Delayed lately...

217
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,220
I...

218
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm so sorry...

219
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,900
You guys...

220
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,660
I'm sorry...

221
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,490
Um...

222
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:00,810
Yeah...

223
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,770
My outfit was supposed to be done around this time...

224
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,270
Music video was supposed to be done around this time...

225
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:07,990
Uh...

226
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,070
Sorry...

227
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,990
Everybody I'm working with has been busy...

228
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,850
But also...

229
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,290
I...

230
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,790
Had to delay the...

231
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,610
Cover...

232
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,290
Because of my voice too...

233
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,950
It was...

234
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,210
The...

235
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:20,830
The...

236
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,650
All the animation and everything for...

237
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,290
Or like the art and everything for it...

238
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,090
Was done...

239
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,370
Back in May...

240
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,450
I've been planning this for a really long time...

241
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,070
Like since...

242
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,770
Since...

243
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,070
Since I heard the song...

244
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,870
The...

245
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,630
Song...

246
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,050
I was like...

247
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,070
I wanna do this...

248
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,710
Cover...

249
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,310
And then I was like...

250
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,730
It would be good...

251
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,800
Of course I was like...

252
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:41,670
Wait...

253
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,710
Nimi's voice is like an angel...

254
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,810
So...

255
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,710
Yeah...

256
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,110
Mm-mm-mm-mm...

257
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,780
And then I...

258
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,730
I decided...

259
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,230
Enjoy goals!

260
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,450
Thank you so much for the tiny gift!

261
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,170
Thank you!

262
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,890
I'm not upset because I know what you are...

263
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,910
Trying your best...

264
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,270
Oh...

265
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,470
I was like...

266
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,290
What am I?

267
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,110
I am a green woman...

268
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,560
Sorry for what...

269
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,940
Our daddy taught us...

270
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,440
Not to be ashamed of our meantime...

271
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm a green female...

272
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,120
So true...

273
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,240
Yeah...

274
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,660
So...

275
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,220
But...

276
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,600
But...

277
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,000
It...

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,040
Looks so good so far...

279
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,440
You guys...

280
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,820
Oh my gosh...

281
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm so excited...

282
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,840
I know I keep like...

283
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,100
Posting...

284
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,760
So good...

285
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
And we sound so good...

286
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,860
And I'm just...

287
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,880
I've just been so...

288
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,420
So excited about it...

289
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,740
So...

290
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,660
It's been a long time since I've been like...

291
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,260
This excited about a cover...

292
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,020
So I'm like...

293
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,380
Yee...

294
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,100
Ha ha ha ha...

295
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,460
Thank you for playing my favorite games...

296
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,380
On my birthday...

297
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,180
Wow...

298
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,480
Wait...

299
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,040
What do you mean...

300
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,920
Your favorite games...

301
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,710
Also see Slick...

302
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,330
Happy Birthday...

303
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,330
I hope I said her name right...

304
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,310
Happy Birthday...

305
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,170
Speaking of Ayoban...

306
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,450
Did you hear their Unwelcome School remix...

307
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,210
When was the last time you did a collab cover?

308
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,940
I guess...

309
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,060
Maybe...

310
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,520
Hanamori...

311
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,360
Back in the day?

312
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,660
There was a...

313
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,360
What was that song?

314
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,580
Kamino...

315
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,340
Oh...

316
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,160
Maybe...

317
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,680
Last year with...

318
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,400
Oh, what was that song?

319
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,440
Did she upload that?

320
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,600
The Steven Universe one...

321
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,060
I guess that one, maybe...

322
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,220
Kami no Mani Mani...

323
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,820
Yeah, yeah...

324
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,860
I guess maybe that one...

325
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,440
Does Herb count?

326
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Well, that was...

327
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,940
That was just...

328
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,980
That was just...

329
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,890
Karaoke...

330
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,730
Sorry, Mint...

331
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,130
I have...

332
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,590
I have always seen mint and turquoise as blue colors...

333
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,510
But it's mint green...

334
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,170
Specific...

335
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,330
Mint green...

336
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,530
I like how people mention the Liz collab, but...

337
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,810
Nerissa...

338
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,530
Iron Mouse...

339
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,690
There were several people there that day too...

340
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,550
Everybody just remember it...

341
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,410
But I don't blame you guys...

342
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,250
Elizabeth's...

343
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,850
Version of that song was so good...

344
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,530
Die with a Smile...

345
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,550
Just so good...

346
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,290
Mmm...

347
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,450
It was so, so good...

348
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,870
Yeah...

349
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,650
Speaking of Elizabeth...

350
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,650
She had her 3D debut...

351
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,050
Yeah...

352
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,670
Herb had her 3D debut...

353
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,310
It was so cute...

354
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,230
I watched it...

355
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,710
I watched Gigi's last night too...

356
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,310
And everybody is all...

357
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,430
I think everybody is on the same page...

358
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,090
I was like...

359
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,950
What was that?

360
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,130
There's Angry Birds on here!

361
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,970
Shut up!

362
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:18,990
Wait...

363
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,350
There's legit stuff in here!

364
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,570
No way!

365
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,590
But also...

366
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,810
I have been recording some other things...

367
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,230
Pac-Man!

368
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,910
What the hell is foot, Chinko?

369
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,460
Wizard Oji-chan...

370
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,440
I liked...

371
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,260
That...

372
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,320
That...

373
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,560
Cover they did together...

374
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,380
It was so cute...

375
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,240
Actually...

376
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,440
It was actually so cute...

377
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,480
Yeah...

378
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,260
A very Gigi...

379
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,000
Debut...

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm sure everybody can agree...

381
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,960
What else is in here?

382
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't even know what to start...

383
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,280
Why...

384
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,480
Wait...

385
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,260
There's flappy foot...

386
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,640
You couldn't be the angel...

387
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,920
Because you couldn't convincingly...

388
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,380
Convincingly chat...

389
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,780
Birth...

390
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,080
After that end prank...

391
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,400
Chat...

392
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,180
Oh, rant...

393
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,240
That's also partially why...

394
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,120
I...

395
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,380
Didn't wanna be...

396
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,320
Okay, so...

397
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,960
I don't wanna say the name of the song...

398
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,360
Just...

399
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,920
Just because I feel like it's too...

400
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,160
Like I've already...

401
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,000
People...

402
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,120
Might already know...

403
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,820
But I don't wanna say...

404
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Because I feel like it'll...

405
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,000
Even though so much has already been given away...

406
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
I feel like it just gives it away too much...

407
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,260
But...

408
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,060
In the song...

409
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,140
The angel...

410
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,920
Is a little more devilish than the devil...

411
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,880
And the devil is a little more like...

412
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,880
Not as devilish as she should be...

413
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,540
You know what I mean?

414
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,140
So...

415
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,380
I thought that it kind of...

416
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,860
Also matched our personalities...

417
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,240
Hmm...

418
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,780
Where Nimi is...

419
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,240
So...

420
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,160
You know...

421
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,900
She's like an angel...

422
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,540
But also...

423
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,580
Oh my gosh...

424
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:17,980
Oh my gosh...

425
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,920
There's one part of...

426
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,340
Oh...

427
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,520
She sounds so good...

428
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,960
I can't wait for you guys to hear it...

429
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,400
She sounds...

430
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,100
She sounds so good...

431
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,140
She sounds so...

432
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,880
So good...

433
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm...

434
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
A medium fan...

435
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,460
Can you do grave robbing ASMR for 444K subs?

436
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:33,820
Okay...

437
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,540
I'm writing it down...

438
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,000
Why...

439
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
Why am I grave robbing them?

440
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:38,980
Grave...

441
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,020
Robbing...

442
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,760
ASMR...

443
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,780
444K...

444
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,080
Okay...

445
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,680
My friend Big Bunny said...

446
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,740
Play Tall Man Run...

447
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,080
Okay...

448
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,460
We'll start with Tall Man...

449
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,320
I've been dreaming about you doing that cover...

450
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,760
It's insane...

451
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,020
Now one day I woke up and it was real...

452
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,100
Yeah...

453
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,100
Does YouTube games have Elsa Pregnant Foot Doctor or any...

454
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,380
Elsa...

455
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,800
I didn't see any Elsa...

456
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,180
Elsa things...

457
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,060
I think Disney would be like...

458
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,160
Nothing even remotely looking like Elsa...

459
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,020
Though we have Bill the Queen...

460
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,280
So...

461
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,300
Yeah...

462
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,280
I got jumpscared by my art in your thumbnail...

463
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,720
Thank you for the...

464
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,400
Yay!

465
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,560
Thank you for the cute art!

466
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,460
Thank you!

467
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,320
It's so cute!

468
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,500
Thank you, thank you!

469
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,400
Alright...

470
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,420
Tall Man Run, shall we start?

471
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,980
Okay, wait...

472
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,840
Does this have BGM?

473
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,900
No?

474
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,000
I guess I'll keep my BGM...

475
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,360
Oh, he's so skinny!

476
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,320
Would you go out on a date with me at 500k subs?

477
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,400
Where are we going?

478
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,200
Mr. Matt Johnson?

479
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:11,760
Where?

480
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,190
Skinny man run...

481
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,970
Denny's?

482
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,690
They actually look like the ads...

483
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,230
Is this like an ad game?

484
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,050
You know what?

485
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,130
I keep getting ads for this one...

486
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,930
It's called like...

487
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,970
It's like some...

488
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,650
Oh gosh, what's it called?

489
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,250
Like Girl Runner...

490
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:38,810
Or something...

491
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,430
And it's like...

492
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,190
This...

493
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,350
Blonde, twin-tailed girl...

494
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,870
That like...

495
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,970
Shoots zombies...

496
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,610
Is...

497
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,970
I keep getting ads for that...

498
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,110
And...

499
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,790
And...

500
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,610
Oh...

501
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,970
I kind of wish that it was on here...

502
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,870
Goddess Run!

503
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,250
Yes!

504
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,010
Oh my gosh...

505
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,450
Oh, it's you knew it...

506
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:08,890
Question...

507
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,830
Do you like cheese?

508
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,250
Because you're pretty...

509
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,910
Cheese...

510
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,570
Yourself?

511
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,250
Huh?

512
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,890
I'm pretty cheese?

513
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,660
If you play the Elsa foot baby doctor games...

514
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,220
I'll have to leave...

515
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,840
There are none!

516
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,700
There are none!

517
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,640
Go to Akihabara!

518
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,740
I'll think about it...

519
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,600
We could maybe do a date to Akihabara at 500k...

520
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,720
But that's a long time from now, so...

521
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,880
Run!

522
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,200
Sure!

523
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,620
Ghost!

524
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,560
Definitely...

525
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,320
The TikTok reddit mindless odd games...

526
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,540
Yeah!

527
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,660
Wait, we might...

528
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,180
We might strike gold here though...

529
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
We'll see...

530
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,200
Okay, here we go...

531
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,420
I'm playing...

532
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,600
Whoa!

533
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,840
Oh, he's expanding!

534
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,580
I'm going plus 50...

535
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,300
Oh, wow...

536
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,620
Wait...

537
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,220
Keep going...

538
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,020
Why is he...

539
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,700
Oh my god...

540
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,860
It's so loud...

541
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,040
No!

542
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,040
Why is he so...

543
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,840
Why is he...

544
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,820
He's not...

545
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,240
He's supposed to be tall...

546
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,340
But he's just like...

547
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,180
Thick!

548
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,340
Oh my god...

549
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,420
It's so loud!

550
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:22,920
Please!

551
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,080
I died!

552
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,760
Wait...

553
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,860
It's so loud...

554
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,640
Hold on...

555
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,460
Oh my god...

556
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,180
I can't...

557
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,240
It's so...

558
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,060
It's so

559
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,410
loud...

560
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,630
Okay, hold on...

561
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,430
Actually...

562
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,090
I'm just gonna turn off the sound effects...

563
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,230
Let's just do that...

564
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,690
Okay, sorry about that everybody...

565
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,110
Alright, let's...

566
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,230
Let's try again...

567
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,250
I wish I could be faster...

568
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,210
Oh, I could be plus...

569
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:53,290
What?

570
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,950
Is this...

571
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,070
Oh...

572
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,710
Wait...

573
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,170
This is how wide I am...

574
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,710
And this is how tall...

575
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:58,870
I'm...

576
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,490
Wow!

577
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,130

I'm a hot dog...

580
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,170
Oh no!

581
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,190
I'm not gonna make it!

582
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,890
What?

583
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,470
I don't...

584
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,770
What the hell is this?

585
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,370
How am I supposed to make it through here?

586
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,630
I die every time!

587
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,870
What am I supposed to do?

588
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,310
Oh, I'm supposed to be big enough to get through, I think...

589
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,150
Maybe...

590
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,570
Oh, I completed it!

591
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,710
Okay...

592
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,130
Okay, here we go...

593
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:28,730
Alright...

594
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,190
Let's go...

595
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,190
Plus 100 up...

596
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,110
What?

597
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,230
This is horrible...

598
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,110
I guess he is tall, man...

599
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,190
Wait, I wanna be taller...

600
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,890
Yeah...

601
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,210
And wide...

602
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,190
I look like a wiener dog...

603
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,190
Explaining the joke...

604
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,510
Japanese for small...

605
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,050
Wait, did I make...

606
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:00,530
Level 3?

607
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,810
Let's go...

608
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,190
Okay, now we're...

609
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,590
Alright, let's go...

610
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,570
I'm so...

611
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,190
Slow...

612
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,570
Whoa...

613
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,110
Sick...

614
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,190
Flip, man...

615
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,290
Whoa...

616
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,430
Oh...

617
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,490
Oh my god...

618
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:14,670
I'm

619
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,460
so...

620
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,600
I'm so...

621
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,180
Ah...

622
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,490
This game sucks, you guys...

623
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,290
This game sucks...

624
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,450
Skinny legend...

625
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,170
I think I got the max score...

626
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,550
I think I'm too good at this game...

627
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,170
I think I'm too good at this game...

628
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,690
Tall...

629
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,230
Taller...

630
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,990
Tall...

631
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,550
Tallest...

632
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,430
Whoa...

633
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,670
Whoa...

634
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,430
It's like you're too...

635
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,260
Oh no, I'm too tall...

636
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,370
It's...

637
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,180
It's too slow...

638
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,630
For it to be like any...

639
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,430
Difficult...

640
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,190
You know...

641
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,370
It's like one of those mobile games...

642
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,090
Yeah...

643
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,990
Are you feeling it?

644
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,690
Are you feeling so like...

645
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,350
Did I make it?

646
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,190
Oh...

647
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,070
I actually completed...

648
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,630
Let's try and get to level 10...

649
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,190
This game inspired astrobot...

650
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,370
I get it...

651
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,190
I see the resemblance...

652
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,430
I wanna become as wide as possible...

653
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,030
Oh...

654
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,590
Here we go...

655
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,230
Alright...

656
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,110
Oh...

657
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,520
How do I become wider?

658
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,760
I like how they give you the option...

659
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:35,880
Like...

660
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
Do you only wanna be...

661
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,800
25...

662
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,080
Taller...

663
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,760
Or...

664
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,520
100 taller...

665
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,800
Eat more...

666
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:45,820
No...

667
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,360
No...

668
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,740
Oh yeah...

669
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,880
It's like when you try to eat to grow...

670
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,900
I'm a growing girl still...

671
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,460
I can grow up...

672
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,280
Taller...

673
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,700
Probably...

674
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,640
Probably...

675
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,760
If I got a little bit more ectoplasm in me...

676
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,620
Wait, I can double...

677
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,520
I can double...

678
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,520
Wait, there's men to fight here...

679
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,400
Wait, there's math?

680
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,600
Oh my god...

681
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,780
They're following me...

682
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,600
Times two...

683
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,020
Times two...

684
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,840
Oh my god...

685
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,260
Wait...

686
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,330
Guys...

687
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,490
I don't think we're gonna make it...

688
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,230
Eat your vegetables...

689
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,370
I do...

690
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,450
I like how we just...

691
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,290
Die...

692
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,410
We just...

693
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,070
Who's that in the background?

694
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,290
Like is he a boss?

695
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,430
Like I can't...

696
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,770
Tell what's going on...

697
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,490
Tall...

698
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:47,950
Tall...

699
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,970
Tall...

700
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,590
Oh yeah...

701
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,690
Wide...

702
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,510
Wide...

703
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,150
Wide...

704
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,330
No down...

705
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,610
No down...

706
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,750
Oh no...

707
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,330
A little down...

708
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:58,790
A little down...

709
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,270
No skinny...

710
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,330
No skinny...

711
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,510
Only thick...

712
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,150
Only big...

713
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,450
I wanna try...

714
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,410
Solar Smash...

715
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,020
I think you dropped something...

716
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,640
It's your copium...

717
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:13,820
What?

718
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,420
Ah...

719
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,700
No...

720
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Yeah...

721
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,580
I caught some downvotes...

722
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:18,940
They're...

723
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,640
They're roasting me on Reddit...

724
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,780
Delicious content slop...

725
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,240
What do you mean?

726
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,440
These are free...

727
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,820
I don't have to pay for anything...

728
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,780
Thanks YouTube...

729
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,100
Oh wait...

730
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,280
We're almost two...

731
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,700
Wait...

732
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:33,880
Okay...

733
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,840
Next level...

734
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,700
We'll become as skinny as possible...

735
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,800
Okay...

736
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
This is...

737
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh my god...

738
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,700
There's bombs!

739
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,360
Who left these here?

740
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,700
Next time we flop...

741
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,700
We're in our flop era...

742
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,840
Eating vegetables and drinking milk...

743
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,640
Won't make you taller...

744
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:53,980
You need...

745
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,700
To eat bones...

746
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah...

747
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,980
Wait...

748
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,620
What was it?

749
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,420
Recently...

750
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,320
That was somewhat obsessed with bones...

751
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,380
Oh, in Oblivion!

752
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:17,920
That's right!

753
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,700
I was like...

754
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,140
Wait a second...

755
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,660
We met someone recently...

756
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,300
That...

757
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,580
Really liked bones...

758
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,540
Okay, here we go...

759
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500
Plus 50...

760
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,440
Plus 25...

761
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,960
Whoa...

762
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,500
Look how big we are...

763
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,520
Holy cow!

764
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,560
Wait...

765
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,360
Thicker...

766
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,560
Mine...

767
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,480
Oh my god...

768
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Bigger...

769
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,680
Oh wait!

770
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,880
I didn't notice the jump!

771
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,520
Look

772
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,530
at his arms!

773
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,870
He can't even...

774
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:57,890
Wait...

775
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,090
So if I'm really tall...

776
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,770
Do I like get all this...

777
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,130
Stuff?

778
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,600
I can't...

779
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,920
Oh he has a boss!

780
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,360
I took him down!

781
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,620
Oh my god!

782
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,360
Oh my god!

783
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,820
Oh my god!

784
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,840
Okay...

785
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Now we try to become as small as possible...

786
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,820
Alright guys...

787
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,120
Tiny...

788
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,000
Tiny...

789
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,520
Oh...

790
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,070
Don't...

791
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,250
Don't ever become too tiny...

792
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,090
You just...

793
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,970
You cease to exist!

794
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,810
You become a head!

795
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,570
And that's it!

796
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,730
Too bad!

797
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,010
Stick figure?

798
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,250
More like thick figure...

799
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,930
Oh yeah baby!

800
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,630
Let's try solar smash!

801
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,730
Get me out of this game...

802
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,010
Also prison life!

803
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,070
There's also city smash!

804
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,710
Okay, I'm gonna bring back the music...

805
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,030
If there is some...

806
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,190
If there is some...

807
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,650
I'm very hesitant...

808
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,430
I will turn it down...

809
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,590
Before I do so...

810
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,570
There has to be music in these games, no?

811
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,730
I say we do that to all tiny folks...

812
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,050
The children?

813
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,770
Is that how you died?

814
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,250
Okay...

815
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,550
Smash...

816
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,850
What do I planet smash?

817
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,950
Or system smash?

818
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,910
Let's go small...

819
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,790
This is our first time smashing...

820
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,170
This is our first smash...

821
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,050
Okay...

822
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,250
I'm moving...

823
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:32,510
Oh...

824
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,360
Expand weapon category...

825
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,260
Oh...

826
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,370
I'm firing it on the planet!

827
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,850
Oh my god!

828
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,250
Oh my god!

829
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,370
I'm just killing everything!

830
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,130
Goodbye Earth!

831
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,190
Can't forget Antarctica!

832
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,570
What else am I supposed to do here?

833
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,430
Come to Brazil they said...

834
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,350
There is no more Brazil...

835
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,330
There's no more anything...

836
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,650
My house!

837
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,230
Is this the game?

838
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,090
I'm...

839
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,430
I'm creating a meatball!

840
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,230
Kinda looks yummy though...

841
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,630
What is this, Hawaii?

842
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,230
Not anymore...

843
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,340
Meatball!

844
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,640
This is what happened to the dinosaurs...

845
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,600
Can you blast Ohio?

846
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,440
Already done, buddy!

847
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,100
You can hear the people...

848
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,580
Wait!

849
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,340
Oh!

850
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,200
Look at that!

851
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,600
It's becoming like...

852
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,460
It's becoming like...

853
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,200
A...

854
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,480
A...

855
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,700
A...

856
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,380
A ball!

857
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,780
I'm so

858
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,490
sorry...

859
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,830
Wait!

860
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,810
Can I blast through?

861
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,890
What's the downside?

862
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,510
Oh, wait!

863
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,610
Oh, whoops!

864
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,640
Poetry, Minto.

865
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,380
Sheer poetry.

866
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:47,940
Okay.

867
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:48,680
Alright.

868
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,180
Planet.

869
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:49,620
Alright.

870
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,400
Change planet.

871
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,160
You have completed the...

872
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,600
What?

873
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,060
Oh, we can do multiple things!

874
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,640
Okay.

875
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,700
Let's send a...

876
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,620
A tentacle man.

877
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,920
Level nine tentacle.

878
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,610
What does it mean?

879
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,630
My

880
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,120
god!

881
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:23,980
Wait.

882
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,740
The wolves with lasers.

883
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,100
No!

884
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,990
Rip Florida!

885
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,550
Yeah, he did go right into Florida.

886
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,110
He's eating the inside out!

887
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,810
What is this one?

888
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,730
This one looks like the Ava angel.

889
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,070
Okay.

890
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,350
What?

891
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,430
Alright.

892
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,930
Why do they hate Earth so much?

893
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,130
Do your thing.

894
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,990
Oh, another one.

895
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,690
Just kidding.

896
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,830
Uh, what's this one?

897
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,170
We're sending more worms.

898
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,710
Oh, oh!

899
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,530
It's about to...

900
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,520
It's literally the Ava angel?

901
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,140
No kidding!

902
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,060
Where'd the...

903
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,780
Where'd the worm go?

904
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,560
Oh!

905
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,680
I'm summoning.

906
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
The worm.

907
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,260
Three billion are dead!

908
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:34,980
Whoa!

909
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh, it just...

910
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,900
Took a chunk.

911
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,000
Holy!

912
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,820
That's a chunk!

913
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,120
That's a big ol' chunk!

914
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,760
What's the point of this game?

915
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,640
What's the point?

916
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,560
I feel like it's too easy.

917
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,600
Aliens.

918
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,160
Wait, what?

919
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,380
Oh, wait!

920
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,280
Now it's defending!

921
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,920
Wait, is it supposed to defend?

922
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,040
Wait, am I supposed to be destroying Earth?

923
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,960
Or...

924
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,380
Protecting it?

925
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,380
It all comes...

926
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,040
Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down...

927
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,740
To nothing...

928
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,120
I want the dog back.

929
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,040
More dogs.

930
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,580
More dogs.

931
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,040
More dogs.

932
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,600
Only dogs.

933
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,300
What's the point of this game?

934
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,840
Nice.

935
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,500
There's still lights on.

936
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
Go dogs, go!

937
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:46,820
Go!

938
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,000
Holy cow!

939
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,020
Can you hit the moon?

940
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,160
Where is the moon?

941
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,180
Uh...

942
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,060
This Earth has...

943
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,720
Oh, there it is.

944
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,020
I don't think so.

945
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,320
It seems quite far, no?

946
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,380
No.

947
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,440
Let's try a different planet.

948
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,410
Let's go to...

949
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,060
Oops, sorry.

950
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:13,480
Oops.

951
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,900
There we go.

952
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,320
Let's go to...

953
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,200
Uranus.

954
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,220
Dogs!

955
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:26,760
Dogs!

956
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,180
Dogs!

957
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,920
Dogs!

958
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,640
More dogs!

959
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,500
More dogs!

960
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,940
More dogs!

961
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,200
More space dogs!

962
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
Actually, hold on.

963
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:45,740
Wait.

964
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,000
Let's do exactly what I did before.

965
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,440
What, does this drill?

966
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Get in there.

967
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,770
Drill!

968
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,210
Drill!

969
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:58,810
Drill!

970
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,550
Why dogs, though?

971
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,750
Uh...

972
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,430
Cause...

973
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,710
That was an option.

974
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,030
Oh!

975
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,650
What's happening?

976
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,510
Well, they're spreading apart.

977
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,350
There it is!

978
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,030
There it goes.

979
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,370
Drilling.

980
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,830
Oh!

981
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,370
We get to join this one!

982
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,310
That's exciting.

983
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,110
Uh...

984
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,290
Wait!

985
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,530
I get to pilot it!

986
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,080
Wait, the dogs did barely any damage.

987
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,740
Did you see that?

988
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,640
This guy's actually digging, though.

989
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,760
But all the damage...

990
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,440
Is it, like, healing itself?

991
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,580
It is!

992
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,240
Look at that!

993
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,410
Oh, yeah.

994
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,750
It's all gas, isn't it?

995
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,300
Lucky you.

996
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,040
Okay.

997
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,380
Let's do...

998
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,730
Minky power drilling your anus.

999
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,350
My anus!

1000
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,090
Nah.

1001
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,970
You live another day.

1002
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,390
Let's try prison life.

1003
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,550
Super scent.

1004
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,670
Never, never, never give up.

1005
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,350
Okay.

1006
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,050
I'm going to jail!

1007
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,210
I'm going to jail!

1008
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,330
Oh!

1009
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,210
Oh, God!

1010
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,470
I'm getting my...

1011
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,430
Help!

1012
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,290
Oh, my God!

1013
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,770
Okay.

1014
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,650
Arrest.

1015
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,350
Which one's me?

1016
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,490
I'm an Alcatraz!

1017
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,870
Oh, my God!

1018
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,430
Alcatraz looks a little different than what I remember.

1019
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,370
It's time to restore peace to this crime-infested place.

1020
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,950
As the new prison warden...

1021
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,410
I thought I was going to be in prison.

1022
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:01,550
As the new prison warden, it is your duty to reform criminals and make this land a safer place.

1023
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,650
Oh.

1024
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,430
I'm going in.

1025
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,090
I'm so slow.

1026
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:07,810
Okay.

1027
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,750
Oh, no!

1028
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,070
It's one of these types of games.

1029
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,130
Oh, no!

1030
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,130
Where, like, you get money.

1031
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,330
And then it's like, okay.

1032
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,210
This money goes here.

1033
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:27,570
What's that white-out game that, like, I get ads for all the time?

1034
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,250
Oh, it does say idle game.

1035
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,870
You're right.

1036
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:35,810
White-out survival.

1037
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,770
That one, that one, that one.

1039
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:39,770
Okay.

1040
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,910
I get the money.

1041
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,910
Did they pay me to go to prison?

1042
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,290
Oh, he's crying.

1043
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:48,870
No bed.

1044
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,410
I wish I weren't so slow.

1045
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,150
Yippee, jail!

1046
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,830
Wait.

1047
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,950
What am I doing here?

1048
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,330
Oh, you.

1049
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:58,690
Okay.

1050
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,070
Are you reformed?

1051
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,350
I'm taking his money.

1052
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,870
Oh, wait.

1053
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,310
Oh.

1054
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:09,310
Okay.

1055
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,250
Come this way.

1056
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,510
Criminal scum.

1057
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,590
Oh, my God!

1058
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,110
He's a free man!

1059
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,230
This game is so slow.

1060
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,950
Holy cow.

1061
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,310
To quote your Oshi, Mike Staklasa.

1062
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,950
Endless trash!

1063
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,810
I take your money.

1064
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,890
You pay me to come into jail, and you pay me to leave jail.

1065
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,050
I fixed him.

1066
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,050
I think I'm good at my job.

1067
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:49,480
After taking multiple dogs and getting mercilessly drilled.

1068
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,840
Uranus healed.

1069
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Okay, so we take this.

1070
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,540
I think we can...

1071
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,660
Oh, I can level up.

1072
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,120
Alright, good.

1073
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,420
Oh, no.

1074
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,480
I'm afraid to click this.

1075
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,160
Is it another ad?

1076
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,420
It looks like you're stuck inside an ad game.

1077
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,320
I am!

1078
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,500
Okay, hold on.

1079
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,200
I'm gonna...

1080
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,920
I'm gonna...

1081
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,540
I'm gonna click it.

1082
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,660
But you guys can't see.

1083
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,480
Just in case it opens something up, you know?

1084
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,160
It just gave me...

1085
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,060
Why wouldn't you click times two?

1086
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,520
It just gave it to me for free.

1087
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,880
Why wouldn't you click that?

1088
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,600
The first hit is free.

1089
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,000
Did you see the trailer for Spy Drops?

1090
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,360
Looks like MGS but with the anime go...

1091
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,500
What?

1092
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,380
No, I haven't heard of that.

1093
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,200
Okay, now you guys are going to dig.

1094
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,640
Oh my god.

1095
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,300
Oh my god.

1096
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:58,520
They're...

1097
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,400
They're digging for...

1098
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,160
Something.

1099
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,480
Wait, I can't lose my prisoners though.

1100
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,140
Because...

1101
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,840
They will...

1102
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,440
They...

1103
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,400
I can't...

1104
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,300
I can't lose them because...

1105
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,640
I can't reform them.

1106
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,260
They will...

1107
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,540
They will not dig for me.

1108
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,320
They yearn for the mines.

1109
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,580
Yeah, exactly.

1110
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,320
Okay, come here.

1111
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,260
Come here, yo.

1112
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,500
I like how they go into jail once and then they're like...

1113
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,020
Yeah, baby!

1114
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,880
Oh, you want to go to the mines!

1115
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,440
Okay.

1116
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,240
Come here.

1117
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,560
Minecraft.

1118
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,820
Minecraft.

1119
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,100
Minecraft.

1120
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,820
He's so upset about it.

1121
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,960
There's also aquapark.io.

1122
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,680
I'm curious.

1123
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,720
There's so many.

1124
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,220
Okay, I'll be back for you guys.

1125
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,180
Oh, we can get this guy.

1126
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,400
We can buy someone.

1127
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,580
Hire someone to do my job.

1128
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,800
Oh, now we're...

1129
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,600
Now we're cooking.

1130
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,020
Now we're cooking.

1131
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,060
Oh yeah!

1132
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,400
Oh yeah!

1133
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,260
Oh yeah!

1134
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,120
Oh yeah!

1135
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:16,740
Oh yeah!

1136
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,100
Sad man.

1137
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,360
Come here.

1138
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,620
Oh, you yearn for the mines.

1139
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,940
You're not reformed at all.

1140
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,540
How many people can go in here?

1141
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,660
Oh, I guess three?

1142
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,960
And there's a toilet.

1143
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,200
Alright.

1144
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,400
Get in there!

1145
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,940
Criminal scam!

1146
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,010
Guys, is this engaging?

1147
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,050
Don't be asleep!

1148
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,410
Let me take your money.

1149
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:53,950
That guy's up.

1150
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,050
That guy's killing that other man!

1151
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,190
Wait a second!

1152
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,270
What is he doing in there?

1153
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:01,850
Actually.

1154
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,510
What's going on?

1155
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,670
I'm confused.

1156
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,710
Can't you do anything?

1157
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,310
Come on!

1158
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:12,990
Okay.

1159
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,050
I think I'm done with prison life.

1160
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,930
It moves so slow.

1161
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,970
Oh, now he's reformed!

1162
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:24,950
Are you sure?

1163
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,890
Oh, he's crying.

1164
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,350
Are you sure you're reformed?

1165
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,950
You were just trying to kill that guy.

1166
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,410
He did the crime.

1167
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,210
He did the time.

1168
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,570
Come on.

1169
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,890
Get out of here.

1170
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,190
You're a big ol' crocodile too.

1171
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,210
Wait, we're gonna level up.

1172
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,470
Yippee!

1173
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,790
You just get free money!

1174
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,150
What's the...

1175
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,490
Why wouldn't you...

1176
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,170
No bed.

1177
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:55,790
Why wouldn't you?

1178
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:58,510
What's this?

1179
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,850
Oh, I can pay to be...

1180
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:03,950
Faster.

1181
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,830
It didn't make a difference at all.

1182
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:08,970
It

1183
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,040
didn't make a difference at all!

1184
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,660
Oh, he's doing it though!

1185
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,320
He's doing the job!

1186
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,180
He's doing the job!

1187
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Okay, come here.

1188
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,200
You're free, you're free.

1189
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:32,960
You're free.

1190
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,960
And I'm taking my money...

1191
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,780
On the way.

1192
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,040
Give me my star.

1193
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,360
Watashi wa star.

1194
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,380
I like how they just leave their money...

1195
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,080
In the jail cell and the criminals don't even take it.

1196
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,540
No bed.

1197
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh, and he's also making me money!

1198
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,340
Wait, this is a lucrative business, huh?

1199
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:57,400
Huh?

1200
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,380
This is pretty great.

1201
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,600
Wait, what are you supposed to do?

1202
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,800
Why are you...

1203
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,660
Oh, you're supposed to go back into the jail cell?

1204
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:06,940
Okay.

1205
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,140
Why are they just leaving their money on the floor?

1206
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,400
Go back in there.

1207
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,360
Okay.

1208
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,660
They yearn for the mines, but there's not enough rock.

1209
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,560
There's just...

1210
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,260
The earth is just not...

1211
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,880
There's just not enough earth for them to mine.

1212
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,140
There can only be one mine...

1213
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,380
One Minecraft Steve.

1214
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,300
Remember to always tip your prison warden.

1215
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,200
Maybe this is like a restaurant, you know?

1216
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,180
Wait, no, no.

1217
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,660
What are you doing?

1218
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,740
You're supposed to be mining.

1219
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,720
You don't want to anymore?

1220
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,400
You tired?

1221
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,120
Minecraft Steve wouldn't get tired.

1222
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm just saying that.

1223
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,520
Get back in here.

1224
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,500
Crybaby.

1225
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,360
Come here.

1226
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,240
You yearn for the mines.

1227
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,100
He tips me every time.

1228
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,140
Go mine.

1229
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,080
He's really doing it.

1230
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,060
Themed prison restaurant.

1231
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,800
I've been to one like that before.

1232
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,480
There used to be a place in Shibuya...

1233
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,380
That was like a prison themed restaurant.

1234
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,180
And...

1235
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,840
But the menu was like pretty icky.

1236
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,940
But all the...

1237
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,620
All the tables were jail cells.

1238
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,760
And the...

1239
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,720
The...

1240
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,820
The servers...

1241
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,140
They were dressed up as nurses.

1242
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,640
J.S.R.

1243
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:30,840
J.S.R.

1244
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,540
Welcome to Mambo Ship.

1245
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,620
Yeah, I'm gonna get x2.

1246
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,280
Oh my god!

1247
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:36,860
They find...

1248
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,580
They get to eat!

1249
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,460
You can eat!

1250
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,260
You can eat!

1251
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,220
Wait, we can have more jail cells.

1252
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,040
We're expanding!

1253
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,920
There's so many more prisoners and they're just leaving their cash on the floor.

1254
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,920
Come on, reformed one.

1255
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,420
Let me take your money first.

1256
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh, I can take two guys now.

1257
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,280
Look at all my cash money!

1258
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,660
Still no bed.

1259
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,100
Go guys!

1260
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:10,920
Wait, what's over here?

1261
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,320
Nothing.

1262
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,120
Oh my god.

1263
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,320
They're just actually sleeping like...

1264
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
Standing up.

1265
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,940
I feel bad.

1266
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,940
What's my phrasing?

1267
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,680
What did I say?

1268
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,660
What did I say?

1269
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,620
I'm sorry!

1270
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,020
Wait, I can upgrade.

1271
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,800
Please.

1272
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,080
Capacity up.

1273
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:34,540
Wait.

1274
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,100
Worker.

1275
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,660
Oh, okay.

1276
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,220
When will I be faster, please?

1277
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,220
Are you hungry?

1278
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,940
Okay, come on.

1279
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:46,800
You can eat.

1280
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,480
As a treat.

1281
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,160
Four people have this bookmarked, by the way.

1282
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,820
Four people are really into...

1283
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,280
Wait, now you don't want to eat?

1284
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,380
You want to go to jail?

1285
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,860
I mean...

1286
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,580
Wait, you're in jail.

1287
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,860
Sorry.

1288
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,280
You want to go to Minecraft?

1289
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,460
There you go.

1290
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,120
Alright, back to your cell.

1291
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,740
How is this an idle game?

1292
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,380
I'm doing so much work.

1293
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,440
They're not even singing, dancing for me.

1294
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,220
It's a hidden gem.

1295
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,440
It does feel like a Roblox game, huh?

1296
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,080
Can't believe I showed up to the stream late as the only person who plays these games unironically.

1297
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,240
Let's play another one.

1298
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:32,900
Exit.

1299
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,620
Wait, hold on.

1300
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,080
I gotta get back to the...

1301
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,140
Okay, here we go.

1302
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,460
Okay, okay, okay.

1303
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,830
Okay, okay, okay.

1304
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,370
What else do we have?

1305
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,550
I mean, we have a million things here.

1306
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,190
We have a bajillion games here.

1307
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,290
They're all free.

1308
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:56,770
They're free.

1309
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:58,130
It's ad free.

1310
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,190
Free free.

1311
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,410
Draw Climber?

1312
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,250
I see Drawing Carnival.

1313
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,330
Don't play Prison Life idle game.

1314
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,010
It sucks.

1315
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,390
Draw...

1316
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:10,690
Climber.

1317
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,330
Try Sandwich.

1318
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,610
Where the hell do you see Sandwich?

1319
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,770
You don't wanna play Emoji Puzzle?

1320
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,390
They have an unfinished port of Jetpack Joyride 2?

1321
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,170
What?

1322
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,550
Oh, I see it.

1323
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,330
Draw Climber.

1324
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:24,570
Okay.

1325
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:27,670
You.

1326
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:28,590
Draw.

1327
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,630
Oh, okay.

1328
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,810
Oh, okay.

1329
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,190
Look at him go.

1330
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,750
My creation.

1331
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:47,590
My son!

1332
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,030
My son!

1333
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:49,830
You can do it!

1334
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,610
I brought you into this world!

1335
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,010
Wait, can I keep drawing?

1336
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,970
Oh, it's so loud.

1337
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,530
Yes, my son!

1338
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,420
Claim 10 coin.

1339
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,110
Speed level 1, 15 coins.

1340
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:14,710
Okay, hold on.

1341
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,210
Searching for him!

1342
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,870
There's opponents!

1343
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:19,450
Oh.

1344
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,210
Okay, okay.

1345
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,650
I'm gonna draw what she draws.

1346
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,170
Tamara?

1347
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,170
I got this.

1348
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:26,990
I got this.

1349
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:27,470
I'm the king.

1350
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,200
Tamara!

1351
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,640
She took the lead!

1352
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,880
Oh my god.

1353
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,160
Too many legs.

1354
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:39,520
Wait.

1355
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,780
Oh, too small.

1356
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,610
Is this Uma Musume?

1357
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,490
I failed already.

1358
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:01,750
Tamara again?

1359
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,190
She's obsessed with this game.

1360
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,510
It's a car.

1361
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,110
It's a car.

1362
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:07,810
It's a car.

1363
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,230
It's a car, you guys.

1364
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,030
It's a car.

1365
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,150
It's a car.

1366
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:11,990
It's

1367
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:15,540
a car.

1368
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,320
Go, go, go.

1369
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,720
Yeah, my son!

1370
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,160
Go, go, go!

1371
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,800
Go!

1372
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:19,980
No!

1373
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,000
Can you imagine if Uma Musume was like this?

1374
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:23,660
No!

1375
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,680
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1376
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,140
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1377
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:26,740
Yes, yes!

1378
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,500
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom!

1379
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:36,940
Tamara, urara!

1380
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,480
Wait, what should we draw next?

1381
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,560
What should we draw next?

1382
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,080
I'm gonna try and color in the whole thing.

1383
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,580
Ar-Arnaldo?

1384
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:56,700
Oh!

1385
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,400
Wait.

1386
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:57,960
Oh.

1387
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,500
Wait!

1388
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,040
No, they're too small!

1389
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:02,840
He can't move!

1390
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,880
He can't move!

1391
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,310
Go, my son, go.

1392
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:10,570
What did he draw?

1393
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,750
Go up the stairs, come on.

1394
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:14,990
Come on, my son!

1395
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,050
Come on, my son!

1396
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,370
A snake?

1397
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,310
There we go.

1398
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,530
Oh,

1399
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:28,430
please!

1400
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,890
Oh, we're not gonna make it!

1401
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,420
I think they drew curly for us.

1402
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,840
Who is this?

1403
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,740
Ar-Arnaldo!

1404
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,200
Who is this guy?

1405
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,460
Make more cars.

1406
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,320
Oops.

1407
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,230
The game is...

1408
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,440
Okay.

1409
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,500
The game is...

1410
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,540
Wait, he drew something else this time.

1411
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,760
It's actively sabotaging me.

1412
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,020
I think it's AI too.

1413
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,960
I think it's a bot as well.

1414
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,560
I came and decided to buy...

1415
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,160
Thank you, EB!

1416
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,300
Uh-oh.

1417
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,080
What if I draw a sad face?

1418
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,460
Oh no!

1419
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,240
I don't think we're gonna make it.

1420
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,060
What do?

1421
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,940
What do?

1422
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,300
What should we draw?

1423
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,500
Oh wait, I'm gonna draw...

1424
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:35,750
I'm gonna draw...

1425
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,470
Um...

1426
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,600
A wisp?

1427
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,200
The

1428
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,840
game is sabotaging...

1429
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,820
The game is sabotaging me.

1430
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,330
It's like...

1431
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,810
Wacky arm inflatable tube...

1432
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:57,530
Oh my gosh.

1433
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,050
Wait, this is actually working though.

1434
00:54:59,610 --> 00:54:59,850
Go!

1435
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:00,130
Go!

1436
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,100
Wait, the wisp is winning!

1437
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,800
I'm fast, right?

1438
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,260
You're a genius!

1439
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,470
Good job, team!

1440
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,470
Good job, everybody.

1441
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,430
Okay, we'll get a wisp this time for sure.

1442
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:29,150
Okay.

1443
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:30,690
Who is our opponent?

1444
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:31,910
Bettany.

1445
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:32,490
Okay.

1446
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,480
Okay.

1447
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,100
You're gonna be a wisp with glasses.

1448
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,080
It's our car!

1449
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,700
It's our car!

1450
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,720
Wait, this is actually working.

1451
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,180
Wait, this is actually working.

1452
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,660
Definitely not poo.

1453
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:02,960
No!

1454
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:03,820
It's not poo!

1455
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,260
One of the boxes stops for a cup of tea.

1456
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,320
Uh-oh.

1457
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:09,280
Uh-oh.

1458
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,040
Oh my god, what a stride!

1459
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:15,900
Oh!

1460
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,380
This was a clear winner!

1461
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,080
Not even clo- Almost!

1462
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:22,960
20!

1463
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:23,480
Wait!

1464
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,540
This is a perfect score, you guys!

1465
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,960
That was a perfect...

1466
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,740
What should we draw now?

1467
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,480
What should we draw now?

1468
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,460
What should we draw?

1469
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,440
A star?

1470
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,100
That would be...

1471
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,220
Oh yeah, that's actually kind of good.

1472
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,540
Okay.

1473
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,120
It looks a little wonky.

1474
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,400
Okay.

1475
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:56,800
Uh-oh.

1476
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:57,600
Uh-oh.

1477
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,040
Oh!

1478
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:01,920
Okay.

1479
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,780
Oh no.

1480
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,680
Oh no, we're stuck.

1481
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,580
Okay, back to star.

1482
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,530
Wait, what if I just draw legs?

1483
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,130
Damn!

1484
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,770
We swept the competition!

1485
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:29,470
Damn!

1486
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:31,630
We swept the competition!

1487
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:35,730
Skedaddling like a...

1488
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:37,270
We...

1489
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,430
Minto sweep!

1490
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,070
Draw little boots, okay.

1491
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,390
Who's our next opponent?

1492
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:43,830
Shiro!

1493
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,930
You would think Shiro's from Japan.

1494
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:46,690
Okay, hold on.

1495
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,950
Little booties.

1496
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,450
I guess that works.

1497
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,990
Oh, wait.

1498
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,230
Oh!

1499
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,040
We need some grip!

1500
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,300
Oh, here we go.

1501
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:08,960
Here we go.

1502
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,080
I can't believe their legs broke!

1503
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,600
That was brutal!

1504
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,800
I imagine the Mario like...

1505
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,140
Every time it's...

1506
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,100
It's flailing in the air.

1507
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,220
We made it!

1508
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,580
Let's try!

1509
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,220
Hold on.

1510
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,360
We've been doing L's, but let's do like a backwards L, you know?

1511
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:39,560
Ralph!

1512
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,160
Okay.

1513
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,540
Like this.

1514
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,980
This might be the real like grip, you know?

1515
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,860
Oh, see, see, see?

1516
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,560
Oh, see, see, see?

1517
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,460
I wonder what the purple wall...

1518
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,240
Oh, uh-oh.

1519
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:54,860
Uh-oh.

1520
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,380
Uh-oh.

1521
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,040
You got this.

1522
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,100
You got this long legs.

1523
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,320
Let me in now.

1524
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,920
And it would be nice.

1525
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh.

1526
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,070
We lost.

1527
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,030
Oh, seven!

1528
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:15,530
We could try that.

1529
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:26,530
Maybe this works.

1530
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,510
Uh-oh.

1531
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:30,970
Uh-oh.

1532
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:31,970
Uh-oh.

1533
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:33,630
Well, I'm gonna figure out...

1534
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:33,870
Uh-oh.

1535
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,710
I'm gonna figure out what the purple wall does.

1536
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:38,570
Uh-oh.

1537
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:39,950
Oh, seven.

1538
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,310
Oh, seven.

1539
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,070
Oh, seven.

1540
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:49,210
Meet-to-kuso-gei streams are always the best because of how much they make you...

1541
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:54,210
Nick Cage is great.

1542
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:55,750
What was that movie?

1543
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:56,690
Long Legs?

1544
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,510
Shall we try a different game?

1545
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,530
Draw Climber was good.

1546
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:06,550
What else we got in here?

1547
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,490
Puh-puh.

1548
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:09,430
Puh-puh!

1549
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,770
A tack hole?

1550
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:16,980
Sandwich?

1551
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,020
You guys wanna play Sandwich?

1552
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:18,540

01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,460

01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,700
Incredible!

1555
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:46,990

1556
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:47,050
Impressive!

1557
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,910
It's like telling me...

1558
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,690
This has gotta be still tutorial though, no?

1559
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,610
Cause it's like...

1560
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:55,790
God game!

1561
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,850
Wonderful nerd emoji!

1562
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,870
It shouldn't matter, like...

1563
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,890
The order...

1564
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,510
That ham is...

1565
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,830
This is a thick sandwich.

1566
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,370
Where's the meat?

1567
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,750
That's what the pink stuff is!

1568
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:13,350
It's ham!

1569
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:13,770
No!

1570
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,910
Whole can of Spam...

1571
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,930
Oh, we're starting to get fancy tricky now, huh?

1572
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:28,910
Lots of cheese...

1573
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:29,790
A lot of cheese...

1574
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:31,900
That's a lot of cheese...

1575
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:35,130
Minto making me a sandwich?

1576
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,510
I should bless them each time, no?

1577
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,300
Oh, wait...

1578
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:44,880
Can I...

1579
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,990
Oh, it works?

1580
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:49,170
Okay...

1581
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:50,710
Oh, it works, okay...

1582
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,130

1586
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,370
Camera-san...

1587
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:00,470
Camera-san...

1588
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:01,190
Camera-man...

1589
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,330
What?

1590
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,580
Okay...

1591
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,000
You just gotta...

1592
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,520
I think...

1593
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:27,760
I think...

1594
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,160
I guess you...

1595
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:28,920
Do one move...

1596
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,300
And it gets rid of the bee...

1597
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,980
Why is there a bee in our...

1598
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,840
Yeah, see?

1599
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,280
Why is there a bee in our...

1600
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,500
Sandwich?

1601
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,710
Not the bees!

1602
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:43,590
More Nick Cage...

1603
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:43,790
Ooh!

1604
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:49,310
Tasty...

1605
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,690
How do you not do this correctly...

1606
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,310
Is my question...

1607
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:54,970
Because...

1608
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,470
As we just saw...

1609
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,310
I was able to put...

1610
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:58,750
I...

1611
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,870
Like...

1612
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:00,930
You see?

1613
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:01,670
Be like...

1614
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,170
Oh...

1615
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,300
I...

1616
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,880
I answered my own question...

1617
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,380
I answered my own question...

1618
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,000

1619
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,520

01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,080
That's how...

1621
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,160
I wonder how complicated they get...

1622
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,460
We'll go up to like...

1623
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,960

01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,440
There's a fly in my soup!

1625
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:26,800
Oh...

1626
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,200
I missed the part where that's my problem...

1627
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:34,560
Deportation...

1628
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:39,920
Yummy!

1629

01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,940
Oh, but then they all open up...

1631
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,420
Oh, I did it again...

1632
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:47,900

There we go...

1635
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,620
There's a bee in there...

1636
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,120
Because sandwiches made you...

1637
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:53,940
Made by you...

1638
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,780
Or all the buzz!

1639
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,200

I feel like I could get addicted to this one...

1645
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:10,930

1646
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,800

01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,460
It's kinda getting interesting...

1662
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,820
These are the tallest sandwiches...

1664
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,500

01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:02,600
The hungriest person ever...

1667
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,680
And why are there so many bees?

1668
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:06,860
Why?

1669
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,000
Why do we have so...

1670
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,200
Such a bee problem?

1684
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:35,710
Nice...

1685
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:37,150

01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:40,070
Bee!

1689
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,320
We added new ingredients...

1690
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,660
Onion and bacon...

1691
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:55,820
Nah...

01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,780
Oh my god...

They're kinda cute...

1694
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,660
The little bees...

1695
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:00,920
Okay...

1697
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,020
We tried...

1698
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:03,920

1699
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,060

Don't worry...

1719
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,200

01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,500
I'm rounding it out...

1725
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,440

Uh...

1729
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,020
Just got my first paycheck...

1730
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:00,760
I wanted to celebrate...

1731
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,570
By letting you have a slice of the pie...

1732
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,550
Enjoy your sandwiches...

1733
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:04,180
Bye...

1734
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:05,900
Congrats...

1735
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,900
Thank you...

1736
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:07,340
Wait...

1737
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,880
It kinda looks like handsome Squidward...

1738
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,040
How do I...

1739
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:11,500
Oh...

1740
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,780
Beautiful...

1741
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,860
What am I...

1742
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,000
Oh...

1743
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:24,740
Wait...

1744
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,620
What do you want me to...

1745
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:29,040
Huh?

1746
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,660
Looks just like me...

1747
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,000
Yeah...

1748
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,880
I thought we were...

1749
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,000
Painting the mask...

1750
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,000
Maybe I am...

1751
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,160
Careful...

1752
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,680
I think I got...

1753
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,000
The mustache already...

1754
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,140
Oh...

1755
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,220
Oh...

1756
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,240
I'm making this guy in the background...

1757
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,140
I think...

1758
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,240
No?

1759
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,100
Wait...

1760
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,140
I don't understand how this works...

1761
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,200
I'm...

1762
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:00,860
I'm...

1763
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,140
I'm confused...

1764
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:15,740
Oh...

1765
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,380
Oh...

1766
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:16,660
See...

1767
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:17,660
Oh...

1768
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:18,560
Wait...

1769
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:18,900
What's this?

1770
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,850
I'll give him ears...

1771
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,890
I'll give him some eyes...

1772
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:27,170
I'll give him his heart...

1773
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,580
I'll give him...

1774
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,480
What is this?

1775
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:32,160
What is that?

1776
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:33,840
Beautiful!

1777
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,580
Is this a tattoo?

1778
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,740
Oh...

1779
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,060
Oh...

1780
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:43,750
Wow...

1781
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:45,990
Wait...

1782
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,800
What is this?

1783
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,730
Did you...

1784
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,750
Graphic design is our best...

1785
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,530
And pretty good at next level...

1786
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,650
Yes...

1787
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,630
It's the Hamburglar...

1788
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,360
Do you guys...

1789
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,000
Did you guys ever watch Hard Gay?

1790
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,020
He was like a...

1791
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,560
He was like a...

1792
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:10,880
Comedian...

1793
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:11,820
In...

1794
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,200
In Japan...

1795
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,740
And he would go...

1796
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:15,580
Ha Doge...

1797
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:15,720
Hoo!

1798
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,590
Every time he would like...

1799
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,170
Come out...

1800
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:25,030
They would play...

1801
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,570
Ricky Martin...

1802
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:30,610
Okay...

1803
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:31,530
I think we're good here...

1804
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:33,470
It's you!

1805
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:36,170
Incredible...

1806
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:36,490
Oh...

1807
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:38,830
Oh my god...

1808
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,230
10 out of 10 game...

1809
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,030
Yes...

1810
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,150
Oh...

1811
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,150
Oh...

1812
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:50,730
Wow...

1813
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:51,510
Wait...

1814
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,170
Iron Man...

1815
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:52,510
Wait...

1816
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:52,750
No...

1817
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:52,870
Wait...

1818
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:52,890
Wait...

1819
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,270
Go back...

1820
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,790
Go back...

1821
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:54,790
I saw...

1822
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,010
Is that Homer Simpson?

1823
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:57,070
Oh no...

1824
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:58,390
There is Elsa...

1825
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,230
Oh no...

1826
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,450
Oh no...

1827
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:02,530
Oh no...

01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,430
Oh no...

01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,870
Oh no...

01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:05,950
Oh no...

1831
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:07,410
Oh no...

1832
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,790
Oh no...

1833
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:09,150
Oh no...

1834
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:09,530
Oh no...

1835
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,140
Oh no...

1836
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,040
Oh no...

1837
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:13,420
Elsa feet!

1838
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,020
Elsa feet!

1839
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,220
Oh no...

1840
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,220
No...

1841
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,320
Wait...

1842
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,240
Oh gosh...

1843
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,340
I can't move this thing...

1844
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,440
Is this good enough?

1845
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,040
Oh, YouTube!

1846
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,380
You had the sneaker in here, didn't you?

1847
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,220
Green, red... Oh!

1848
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,080
Come back, everybody!

1849
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,100
Nimi, thank you so much for the redirect!

1850
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,740
Hi, everybody!

1851
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,080
I'm playing games on YouTube!

1852
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,840
Did you know that YouTube had games?

1853
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,820
I don't know how to get out of this.

1854
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:54,640
Elsa...

1855
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,480
Elsa, please!

1856
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,060

01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,840
Oh, okay, I went back.

01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,200
Okay...

01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:12,560
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1865
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:13,840
My conditions were made...

1866
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,060
Goodbye, bitch!

1867
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:15,700
Oh,

1868
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,840
it's really cursed!

1869
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,200
Make the jonkler...

1870
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,760
This one?

1871
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:23,600
Yeah, we'll make the... Okay.

1872
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,680

Ravi, thank you!

1879
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,020
Thank you guys so much!

1880
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,710
Alrighty, let's make the jonkler...

1881
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:34,720
In...

1882
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:35,860
Sim...

1883
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:36,480
Simly clay?

1884
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:37,720
Right!

1885
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,700
We'll give him...

1886
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,000
We'll give him the jonkler face.

1887
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:41,360
Alright.

1888
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,420
Oh gosh!

1889
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,860
I don't like this part.

1890
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:45,620
Cool!

1891
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,920
I don't like this part at all.

1892
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,960
It's really scary.

1893
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,440
I'm making the jonkler, everybody.

1894
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,160
This is how you sculpt.

1895
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:01,720
Truly.

1896
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:02,600
Wait!

1897
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,280
I can stop it whenever I want!

1898
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,540
I can stop whenever I want!

1899
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:11,720
Okay.

1900
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,420
Let's give him some...

1901
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:13,720
Wait.

1902
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,980
Let's give him red here?

1903
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:16,260
Wait.

1904
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:16,800
Oh wait.

1905
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,520
Isn't it opposite?

1906
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:18,520
Hold on.

1907
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,180
It's gr...

1908
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,120
It's red here.

1909
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,420
And then green on his eyes, right?

1910
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:24,660
My bad.

1911
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,840
I messed it up.

1912
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,320
Actually, we can make it any color we want.

1913
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:33,620
Okay.

1914
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,320
Here.

1915
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,100
Here.

1916
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,460
Green.

1917
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,280
Green.

1918
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,800
All green.

1919
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:43,900
Wait, his nose?

1920
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:44,960
Green.

1921
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:47,860
What's...

1922
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,900
How can I use his back?

1923
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,680
Keep going!

1924
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,900
I don't think we can.

1925
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:56,880
Okay.

1926
01:13:59,460 --> 01:13:59,980
Beautiful!

1927
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,560
Give him some ears.

1928
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:03,380
Oh.

1929
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,680
Give him some ears.

1930
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,060
Give him some ears.

1931
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,040
Wait.

1932
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:09,960
We keep giving him ears.

1933
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,640
Oh!

1934
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,940
Give him some eyes.

1935
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:12,780
Oh my gosh.

1936
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,260
Blue...

1937
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,040
Blue-eyed person staring at you.

1938
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,340
What's this?

1939
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:16,900
A brain?

1940
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:17,680
Oh, hair?

1941
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,140
Oh, I can give him...

1942
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:20,160
Oh.

1943
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,040
And then...

1944
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,220
We finish it off with...

1945
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,700
With my signature.

1946
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,920
It isn't a Minto original.

1947
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:51,840
Without...

1948
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,200
Without him.

1949
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,940
Make him...

1950
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:57,460
Make him...

1951
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,460
Make it his eyebrows, actually.

1952
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,880
Oh, yeah!

1953
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:02,800
Oh, yeah!

1954
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,680
Just like the movie!

1955
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,940
You wanna know how I got these scars?

1956
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:11,600
Wait.

1957
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,120
This should be scars, huh?

1958
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,460
You wanna know how I got these scars?

1959
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:17,940
You wanna know how I got these scars?

1960
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:27,430
Ugh.

1961
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,190
Get...

1962
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:28,890
Jonkled.

1963
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:30,390
Yippee!

1964
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:31,930
Give him brown context.

1965
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,290
Wait, what's this?

1966
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:36,970
What is...

1967
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,270
Oh.

1968
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,860
What am I doing?

1969
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:43,580
What is this?

1970
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,280
I'm filling the box with S.

1971
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,690
Now that you mentioned him...

1972
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,430
I'm getting flashbacks of Howard O'Gain...

1973
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,150
Taking a random street guy's cigarette...

1974
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:03,090
And putting it in his pants...

1975
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:03,630
And then dancing.

1976
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:04,630
Yeah, he did that.

1977
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:08,150
S...

1978
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,430
S for society!

1979
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:12,430
S...

1980
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:13,230
Society!

1981
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:17,770
Oh, yeah!

1982
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:28,310
Okay, I think I'm done sculpting people.

1983
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:33,450
That was...

1984
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,330
Guess their answer!

1985
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:39,290
Okay, let's try it.

1986
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:40,430
Let's guess their answer.

1987
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:43,470
If all of us guess, we'll truly be able to...

1988
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,030
To know.

1989
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:44,710
We will know.

1990
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:47,810
Minto.

1991
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:50,150
It looks like an iPhone.

1992
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:53,090
Okay.

1993
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,370
Look at me go.

1994
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,310
Versus...

1995
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:03,930
Penny?

1996
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,080
Pear!

1997
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:15,940
Oh, shoot.

1998
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:16,600
Pear!

1999
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,180
Already given.

2000
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:18,640
Oh!

2001
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,180
Starfruit!

2002
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,380
Hell yeah!

2003
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,700
Yellow fruit!

2004
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,040
Banana!

2005
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,200
Oh yeah!

2006
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:28,000
Oh yeah!

2007
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:28,700
Oh yeah!

2008
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:29,200
Oh yeah!

2009
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:29,900
Uh...

2010
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,540
Durian?

2011
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:32,540
Wrong.

2012
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:34,920
Pineapple!

2013
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,980
Goku kinda sucks at this.

2014
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,380
I'm not gonna lie.

2015
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:39,640
Mango?

2016
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,900
It's like more orange, no?

2017
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,320
Lemon!

2018
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,540
I'm not good at these types of games.

2019
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,080
What is...

2020
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:49,880
This is like...

2021
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,240
The price is...

2022
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,160
Not the price is right.

2023
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,420
Family feud!

2024
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:54,420
What?!

2025
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,960
Mango is not yellow!

2026
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,480
Mango is orange and green and red!

2027
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,440
Boo!

2028
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:02,860
Goku!

2029
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,560
Oh, the inside of Mango!

2030
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,860
Uh...

2031
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:15,360
Damn!

2032
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,640
I get 85 bucks?

2033
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,460
Wait, who am I gonna face off against next?

2034
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,000
Superhero!

2035
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,780
Superman!

2036
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,140
Batman!

2037
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:28,140
Uh...

2038
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,380
Iron Man!

2039
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,260
Aquaman!

2040
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,540
Spider-Man!

2041
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,560
Goku!

2042
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,600
Goku literally only...

2043
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,760
Wait, I actually guessed every single one of them.

2044
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,660
That's crazy.

2045
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,000
I guessed literally every single one!

2046
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,940
That was crazy!

2047
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,560
What?!

2048
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,320
Whoa!

2049
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,560
Sorry, Goku.

2050
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,560
Goku is not a superhero.

2051
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,060
He's a Super Saiyan.

2052
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:09,230
Name a sport.

2053
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,090
Basketball!

2054
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,430
Base...

2055
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:13,150
Man.

2056
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,690
Um...

2057
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:17,280
Soccer...

2058
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:18,750
Uh...

2059
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:19,590
Football!

2060
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,010
What else?

2061
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,550
Uh...

2062
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:22,930
Ball?

2063
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,130
Wrong.

2064
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,890
Basement.

2065
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:28,200
I was still thinking of like Aquaman and...

2066
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:29,090
Uh...

2067
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:29,350
Golf!

2068
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,270
Good job, team!

2069
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:35,810
Good job.

2070
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:36,450
I don't think...

2071
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,510
I think this is rigged.

2072
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,830
I can't be getting every single answer right.

2073
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:42,650
I can't be getting every single answer right.

2074
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:42,870
You know?

2075
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:44,930
I feel like this is rigged.

2076
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:52,570
Pick a chest!

2077
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:54,390
Oh!

2078
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,770
Easy, meeny, meeny, miny, moe.

2079
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,310
Catch a tiger by his toe.

2080
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:59,070
If he hollers, let him go.

2081
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:03,130
My mom said to pick the very best one.

2082
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:04,910
And you are it.

2083
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,630
Ten bucks!

2084
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,570
The most we could guide is 500...

2085
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,690
Oh, I have three keys!

2086
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,270
Okay...

2087
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,210
Twenty

2088
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:20,920
dollars!

2089
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,520
We made it.

2090
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,900
Who are we gonna fight now?

2091
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,540
Push the buzzer.

2092
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:26,420
Me!

2093
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,940
I pushed the buzzer!

2094
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,340
Oh my god!

2095
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,180
Oh my god!

2096
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,060
We're killing him!

2097
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,060
I'm dancing on his grave!

2098
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,080
GG!

2099
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,880
I'm going to the semi-finale...

2100
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,000
Finals, you guys!

2101
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,800
Best chest, bottom right.

2102
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,920
I didn't open that one.

2103
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,000
These are not real people.

2104
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,980
Wait, there's like a bajillion people here.

2105
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:01,960
Wait, I can change clothes!

2106
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,900
Never mind, I cannot change clothes.

2107
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:07,200
What's this?

2108
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:08,880
Daily challenge!

2109
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,520
Can you guess the most popular answer?

2110
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,880
Guess the answer?

2111
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:15,360
Oh!

2112
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,150
Name of...

2113
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,000
Breakfast beverage.

2114
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,220
Orange juice.

2115
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,000
Do I go?

2116
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:25,820
Do I go?

2117
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,440
Okay, I clicked it.

2118
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,160
I'm surprised coffee isn't there, right?

2119
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,600
Oh my god!

2120
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,190
It's Sco...

2121
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:38,710
You guys, this is Squid Game.

2122
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:42,090
McDonalds!

2123
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,200
Oh my god!

2124
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,140
Yeah!

2125
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,440
Everybody else, die!

2126
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,020
Die!

2127
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:53,500
Die!

2128
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:57,860
Oh!

2129
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,700
Would you bless me with a happy birthday?

2130
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,540
Shout out!

2131
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,260
Help me...

2132
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,920
Get my wife into Metal Gear.

2133
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,200
Now she's in love with the Legend of Oslo.

2134
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:04,560
Of course...

2135
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:05,740
Nighthater!

2136
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,280
Wait...

2137
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,360
Is it your birthday?

2138
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:09,760
Or your wife's birthday?

2139
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:12,760
Anyways...

2140
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,400
Happy birthday!

2141
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:13,820
Oh!

2142
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,380
I lived?

2143
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,060
Wait...

2144
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,180
Answer faster.

2145
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,620
Oops, I got distracted.

2146
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,480
Yeah, I'll try again.

2147
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:27,640
We got this easy!

2148
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,860
I didn't even get burnt.

2149
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,560
Name a sportswear brand.

2150
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:34,740
N...

2151
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,500
Nike!

2152
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,080
Final answer!

2153
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:40,940
Oh my gosh, I almost picked Crocs.

2154
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:42,900
I almost picked Crocs, you guys!

2155
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:43,680
I would've died!

2156
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,060
I would've died!

2157
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,380
Okay, okay!

2158
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,480
Name something you never leave home without.

2159
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:50,940
Phone.

2160
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,120
My pet.

2161
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:58,260
I'm kinda curious about aquapark.io.

2162
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,240
The people are dying.

2163
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,760
The children are crying.

2164
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,580
Name somewhere you can swim.

2165
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,900
I mean, you could swim in any of these.

2166
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,340
Technically.

2167
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,110
Do I have to split the prize money?

2168
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,850
Holy 600 bucks!

2169
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:28,670
Wow, okay.

2170
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:30,930
Okay.

2171
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,370
I'm going against Liliana.

2172
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:34,870
Round one, go!

2173
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:35,730
Can you...

2174
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:36,790
Where can you find...

2175
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,810
Oh, a pencil.

2176
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:39,630
Pen.

2177
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,250
Uh...

2178
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,350
What did you get wrong?

2179
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:45,010
Uh...

2180
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:45,730
Eraser.

2181
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:48,970
Uh...

2182
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:50,450
Pitbull!

2183
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:51,790
Mr. World...

2184
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:52,470
World...

2185
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:53,130
High...

2186
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,230
Light...

2187
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:54,790
Marker.

2188
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:56,570
Marker.

2189
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,450
Okay, that works.

2190
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:58,750
Ruler!

2191
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:00,050
Whoa!

2192
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:04,950
Guys, I think...

2193
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,350
These games are rigged.

2194
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,710
I'm gonna try something really off the wall next time.

2195
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:14,230
Something kinda crazy.

2196
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:20,310
Baby games.

2197
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:22,750
Name a friend of Mickey Mouse.

2198
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:23,750
Mickey Mouse.

2199
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,520
Mouse.

2200
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:35,560
Mouse.

2201
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:36,680
Mouse.

2202
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,600
Uh...

2203
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,300
Uh...

2204
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,240
Uh...

2205
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,020
Who are you getting wrong?

2206
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:43,940
Pluto!

2207
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,220
Uh...

2208
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,440
Sora?

2209
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:48,780
Goku.

2210
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,280
Um...

2211
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,340
Oh...

2212
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,220
Uh...

2213
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:56,940
Riku.

2214
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,460
I'm gonna see if he gets any more.

2215
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,180
Pete!

2216
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:04,900
S...

2217
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:05,180
S...

2218
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:09,050
Sora...

2219
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,050
Sora was wrong!

2220
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:11,830
It was...

2221
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:13,310
Oh, Daisy...

2222
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:15,450
Jack!

2223
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:18,380
Guys, remember that song?

2224
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:21,840
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da...

2225
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,500
Jack!

2226
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,410
Who is Pete?

2227
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:29,090
Pete is the...

2228
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:29,810
Big...

2229
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:30,450
Big...

2230
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:31,330
He's like a cat.

2231
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:43,230
He's the... He's like the... He's the... The big cat guy that... He's the bad guy... Yeah, somehow he's a... Somehow he's a cat.

2232
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,530
He's the big cat.

2233
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:48,750
The big bully.

2234
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:49,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2235
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:52,650
What can you do on... You got games?

2236
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:55,910
Um... Tinder.

2237
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:58,470
Wrong.

2238
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,610
Wrong.

2239
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,930
Uh... What else can you do on a phone?

2240
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:03,430
Calculator.

2241
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,910
Wow, that worked.

2242
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:06,670
YouTube.

2243
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:08,630
Videos.

2244
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,090
Um... Internet.

2245
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:14,410
Wrong.

2246
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:15,850
Text.

2247
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:17,210
Call.

2248
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:18,710
Easy.

2249
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:21,610
I should have said TikTok.

2250
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,070
Oh, they said photos.

2251
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:27,890
I don't know why I completely forgot what you can do on a phone all of a sudden.

2252
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:31,870
Dang, I got a lot of money for that.

2253
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,010
Okay, bottom right.

2254
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:37,510
Ten bucks.

2255
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:42,610
It would take things... A burglar would not want to see...

2256
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:45,470
Wait, for... Wait, what?

2257
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:49,030
Top left.

2258
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,550
Okay, this is the 500.

2259
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,830
Wait, best reward is a puzzle piece.

2260
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:57,030
Oh my gosh, I got the puzzle piece!

2261
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:57,270
Nice!

2262
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,010
We can go to the beach!

2263
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:00,910
Alright, time to die.

2264
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:03,550
Oh my god!

2265
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,460
Oh my god!

2266
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,440
I killed Pitbull!

2267
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,300
I killed Pitbull!

2268
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,480
Oh, they're so sad.

2269
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,220
Wait, can I get new clothes?

2270
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,760
Random skin, 200.

2271
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,720
Random skin, 400.

2272
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,560
Old man.

2273
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,180
Random skin, 600.

2274
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,140
Is that Kill Bill?

2275
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:38,570
Dan...

2276
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:39,730
Dan...

2277
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,250
Dan...

2278
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:40,570
Dan...

2279
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:40,950
Dan...

2280
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:41,310
Oh!

2281
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:42,450
Oh, uh...

2282
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,350
Game of Thrones!

2283
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:46,370
Oh, uh...

2284
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:47,670
I can't say her name.

2285
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:50,890
Oh, TikTok.

2286
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:54,410
Um...

2287
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:55,190
Twitter.

2288
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:58,220
Uh...

2289
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,160
Uh, Instagram.

2290
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,240
I'm only thinking of the things that I use.

2291
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:04,500
YouTube.

2292
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,520
I never think of that as like a...

2293
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,940
As a social media platform, you know?

2294
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,260
MySpace.

2295
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:11,820
Let's see.

2296
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,180
22?

2297
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,860
Who are these boomers?

2298
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:17,820
Oh, Facebook.

2299
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:18,580
Oh my gosh.

2300
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,100
It's like the quintessential.

2301
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:26,060
I got literally every single one of them.

2302
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,360
Girl, what are you doing?

2303
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,180
Okay, I think I'm done with this game, though.

2304
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,500
What else should we do?

2305
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:36,860
Bazooka Boy.

2306
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:39,900
Stealthmaster.

2307
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,760
Or Cat Escape.

2308
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:47,740
Wait, I feel like we have to do Stealthmaster, no?

2309
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,920
Who uses Facebook anymore?

2310
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,460
I don't know.

2311
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:55,440
Cat Escape.

2312
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:59,020
Kind of want to do something, like, exciting, you know?

2313
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:00,640
Hmm.

2314
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,800
Flappy Dunk.

2315
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,320
Twisted Tangle.

2316
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,320
Merge Master.

2317
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:16,730
Fruit Ninja's right there.

2318
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:17,350
Wait, where?

2319
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,210
I don't see it.

2320
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:24,330
I could do Running Pet.

2321
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:26,930
What do you mean?

2322
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,610
Harvest.

2323
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:29,630
Harvest.io?

2324
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:30,570
Harvestio?

2325
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:32,730
I passed it?

2326
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:34,810
Where?

2327
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:37,790
Huh?

2328
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:39,130
Ah,

2329
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,420
I see it.

2330
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:47,780
Fruit Ninja.

2331
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,840
Wait, the original Fruit Ninja.

2332
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,960
Is it actually?

2333
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:58,780
Oh.

2334
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:00,740
I did it.

2335
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:09,190
Ah!

2336
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:11,910
Oh, I've never played Fruit Ninja before.

2337
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:15,990
Natsukashii!

2338
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:18,950
Tashka ni.

2339
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:24,530
Oh.

2340
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:29,010
Oops, you've sliced the bomb, but congrats, you get three bomb deflects.

2341
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:29,970
Nice.

2342
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:32,590
I get three of them.

2343
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,270
Whoa, combo!

2344
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,310
Bumble Cup!

2345
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:48,110
Whoa, this actually runs really smoothly, too.

2346
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,110
This is impressive.

2347
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,630
This is impressive.

2348
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:56,750
Oh, oopsie.

2349
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:05,370
Making a fruit salad.

2350
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,910
This is making me hungry a little bit.

2351
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:10,350
It's making me a little hungry.

2352
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:20,910
Wait, now you guys know you can play Fruit Ninja on YouTube if you ever knew.

2353
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:24,430
My mate is also a ninja.

2354
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:24,890
Ow!

2355
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,430
Ow!

2356
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:28,630
Ow!

2357
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,150
Sorry.

2358
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:30,210
What is this?

2359
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,770
I'm actually Raiden!

2360
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:43,770
Slice.

2361
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:45,390
Oh, that was close.

2362
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:46,770
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

2363
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,070
Just like Raiden.

2364
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:52,470
Whoa, that was so close.

2365
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:54,190
Oh no, wait.

2366
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:55,890
I did accidentally touch it, I think.

2367
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:56,730
Oops.

2368
01:31:58,210 --> 01:31:58,730
Nice.

2369
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:01,330
Baby Sensory Video Revenge.

2370
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:02,170
Oh, I missed one.

2371
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:02,770
No!

2372
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:05,790
I missed a fruit.

2373
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,230
Oh, I'm getting fired.

2374
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:09,030
I'm getting fired.

2375
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:09,770
I'm getting fired.

2376
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:12,970
Why is the best 2-2-2, but my score is 2-2-7?

2377
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:20,490
It's time for...

2378
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:20,670
Woo!

2379
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:22,330
Minto the Ladder Rip.

2380
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,030
Doctor.

2381
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,550
Nice.

2382
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:32,590
I think I'm the best to ever do it.

2383
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:41,370
Nice.

2384
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:48,500
Uh-oh, I think I lost another fruit.

2385
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:51,140
Oh!

2386
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:51,980
That was close.

2387
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,540
I thought I got that banana.

2388
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,620
Oh, I think I died!

2389
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:00,290
No!

2390
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:00,950
No!

2391
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,920
Is this dancing fruit for Ghost Forever 19 and people over 30?

2392
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,800
What does that mean?

2393
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,020
I wonder if these games, like, save your progress.

2394
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,060
You know what I mean?

2395
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,800
Or if...

2396
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,500
Oh, wow!

2397
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:27,440
Way!

2398
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:29,120
This is so nice!

2399
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:33,100
And if you guys ever want to play, you don't have to worry about ads.

2400
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:36,980
Now you know.

2401
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:39,940
Now you know.

2402
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:40,020
Now you know.

2403
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,740
This reminds me of the good old days after...

2404
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,260
I wonder how many old Flash games are still around.

2405
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:52,200
Maybe Crazy Monkey Armor games.

2406
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,120
I don't...

2407
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,040
I mean, I don't know that.

2408
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:57,260
It's the whole game?

2409
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:57,920
I think so!

2410
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,740
We should try Fashion Battle.

2411
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,540
Okay, let's try it.

2412
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,060
Doctor.

2413
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,160
Turn off my Coco Melon.

2414
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:08,500
Ooh, girl!

2415
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,300
I'm tapping to play.

2416
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:13,160
Oh, oh, oh.

2417
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,300
How do we have this?

2418
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,860
What do you mean, nightclub?

2419
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,220
How do we have stuff like this and then also, like, official license Fruit Ninja?

2420
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:23,380
Glowing.

2421
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,020
Wait, I want to choose my own hair!

2422
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:29,860
Hmm.

2423
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:30,800
Hmm.

2424
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,220
Ooh, this is what they wear to the club.

2425
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:33,680
Ooh.

2426
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:35,140
The glasses?

2427
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:35,840
This is...

2428
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,020
Pretty.

2429
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,100
Ooh.

2430
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,180
Wait, the red would match better, though.

2431
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,360
What the hell is this?

2432
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:43,320
Oh.

2433
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:43,800
Oh.

2434
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:44,260
Ooh.

2435
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:44,760
Oh.

2436
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:45,240
Hmm.

2437
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:45,820
Hmm.

2438
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:51,220
Oh, I'm 10 out of 10, baby.

2439
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:54,840
Oh, my God.

2440
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,560
Get out of here, Emily.

2441
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,000
It's my turn to shine.

2442
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:08,770
I like how we just kill people in these games when...

2443
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:10,370
They lose.

2444
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,750
So much brutal murder today.

2445
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,250
Likes or win prize.

2446
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:20,890
Oh, so we can either get likes.

2447
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:21,270
Okay.

2448
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:22,930
Let's get likes.

2449
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,870
We want the world to love us.

2450
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:27,130
Oh.

2451
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:28,350
Oh, I get it.

2452
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:28,930
Okay, never mind.

2453
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:29,590
I'm leveling up.

2454
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:32,510
I thought that was, like, what battle you do.

2455
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:33,210
Okay, just kidding.

2456
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:34,510
All right.

2457
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:35,750
Hannah.

2458
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,950
Sport.

2459
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:40,650
This is definitely a Roblox game.

2460
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:42,830
This one.

2461
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:44,270
Apply.

2462
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:46,330
Oh, sexy.

2463
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:47,590
I thought she said fancy.

2464
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:50,690
What is this?

2465
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:51,090
Oh.

2466
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:52,590
So chic.

2467
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:53,710
So chic.

2468
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,430
Mint is 11 out of 10.

2469
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:56,710
Thanks.

2470
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:57,790
Oh, damn.

2471
01:35:58,450 --> 01:35:59,210
Oh, this is cute.

2472
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:00,330
Oh, my God.

2473
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:00,870
Stunning.

2474
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:02,770
Yes, queen.

2475
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:05,770
Yes, queen.

2476
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:07,970
Stylish.

2477
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:16,830
Roblox game.

2478
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:17,270
Yeah.

2479
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:20,150
Okay, I think I'm done with this one.

2480
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:20,910
Killer.

2481
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:26,470
She even got moves.

2482
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:30,150
All right.

2483
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:30,830
Let's see.

2484
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,870
Let's try something else.

2485
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:36,930
Race Master 3D.

2486
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:39,130
What is family life?

2487
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:40,810
What is this?

2488
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,560
I'm a lady.

2489
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:49,140
We're playing YouTube games.

2490
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,060
Did you guys know that YouTube has games?

2491
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,660
It's the Baker family.

2492
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:56,960
Wait, what's happening?

2493
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,460
I'm making money per second.

2494
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,060
Oh.

2495
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,540
Taya and Tobias met at a basketball game.

2496
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,540
Make fun of this game.

2497
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:09,080
It's Tobias' favorite star.

2498
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,240
Wait.

2499
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:11,060
What do you mean love?

2500
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:18,370
What's bit life?

2501
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:19,390
Take off.

2502
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:20,230
Thanks for the good time.

2503
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:21,530
Um.

2504
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,150
Play basketball together.

2505
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:27,270
Taya and Tobias have fallen in love.

2506
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:27,590
What?

2507
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:29,490
You played basketball once?

2508
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:32,470
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2509
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:33,610
New meta.

2510
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:36,750
If you ever want to get married.

2511
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:37,630
Oh.

2512
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,910
You know how it's like...

2513
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:39,050
Okay.

2514
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:40,770
Remember how there's like the...

2515
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,290
I want to drink your miso soup every...

2516
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:43,110
Every day or whatever.

2517
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:44,510
Now it's like...

2518
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:45,850
Instead of Netflix and chill.

2519
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:48,190
Do you want to like...

2520
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:49,470
Play basketball together?

2521
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:53,290
Valentine, thank you so much for the game.

2522
01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:53,850
Thank you.

2523
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,430
Um.

2524
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:57,910
Have a free live stream.

2525
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:58,370
Oh my gosh.

2526
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:59,170
Content, baby.

2527
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:02,150
Why are you sad?

2528
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:05,430
You just got married.

2529
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:06,350
Why are you so sad?

2530
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:07,850
Oh.

2531
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:09,570
Have a baby.

2532
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,010
Taya is...

2533
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,750
It happened so fast.

2534
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:15,770
Oh.

2535
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:19,330
We have like so much money.

2536
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,150
Best doctor in town.

2537
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,010
Unlock the life point event.

2538
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:26,070
A baby.

2539
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:28,070
Minus $74.

2540
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:29,390
$74 per second.

2541
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:30,730
What?

2542
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:34,670
Is he eating the cash?

2543
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,350
Oh my god.

2544
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:41,190
Each newborn baby produces one life point.

2545
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:43,510
That is retained even if the game fails.

2546
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:48,850
You can use life points to redeem these amazing event rewards.

2547
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:51,810
They have about $10k on the road.

2548
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:55,690
That's...

2549
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:58,690
That's enough money that you need to turn it in.

2550
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:02,230
If you keep that money, you will go to jail.

2551
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,010
Yeah, that's mafia money.

2552
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:09,410
That is dirty money.

2553
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:12,170
Can we play YouTube games and get married?

2554
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:17,290
No, we're playing YouTube games and basketball.

2555
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:22,730
Okay, let's do $10k on the road.

2556
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:23,690
We're going to jail, baby.

2557
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:27,490
Oh, okay.

2558
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:30,910
The music is so Sims, right?

2559
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:33,730
Warren's dad...

2560
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:35,110
To buy...

2561
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:35,450
Oh, okay.

2562
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:36,510
Warren is the baby.

2563
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:39,970
Want to give him a more unique and meaningful name.

2564
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:42,470
Woody.

2565
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:44,210
Woody.

2566
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:44,250
Wait.

2567
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,190
Wally or...

2568
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:50,390
Hey there, Woody.

2569
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:53,170
I've got a snake in my boot.

2570
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,950
Okay, we just renamed our baby.

2571
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:00,090
More, more, more.

2572
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:02,110
Have another baby!

2573
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:04,850
Taya and Tobias feel...

2574
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:07,850
Having another child would make their family even more complete.

2575
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:09,650
How...

2576
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:12,550
What's the timeline here?

2577
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,130
Has it been like a week?

2578
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:18,770
Keep pumping them out.

2579
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:19,050
Yeah.

2580
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:19,990
Have a baby.

2581
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:20,910
Have a baby.

2582
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:23,670
What is search it online?

2583
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:28,530
After the surgery, Taya feels sad and notices she's not as healthy.

2584
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:29,150
Oh, no!

2585
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:30,650
P.N.

2586
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:31,770
Oh, no.

2587
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:32,330
I'm sorry.

2588
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:35,630
Where's our second baby?

2589
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:40,350
Taya is angry because her boss has assigned her unreasonable tasks.

2590
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:42,530
Requestionate...

2591
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:43,130
What does this do?

2592
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:43,990
Oh, okay.

2593
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:45,430
Woody.

2594
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:48,710
Like being named that, do you think?

2595
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:51,890
The date is up on the top?

2596
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:54,210
This?

2597
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:57,690
This is no date?

2598
01:40:58,530 --> 01:40:59,670
This is our cash.

2599
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:00,050
Money.

2600
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:02,430
Um...

2601
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:03,950
Avchi just had a baby.

2602
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,010
Request an extension.

2603
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:05,570
P.N.

2604
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:09,450
The leader not only disagrees, but also mocks Taya?

2605
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,780
Why is the baby more expensive?

2606
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:18,460
Oh, my God.

2607
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:21,860
The boss thought Taya wasn't working hard and scolded Taya in front of everyone.

2608
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,100
Show your evidence.

2609
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,180
The boss was very angry.

2610
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:26,660
Oh, no!

2611
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:27,820
Uh-oh.

2612
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:29,320
Why are...

2613
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:29,720
Uh-oh.

2614
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:30,780
Uh-oh.

2615
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:31,460
We're in the red.

2616
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:34,460
Is this a roguelike?

2617
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,360
I think so.

2618
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,740
Oh, my gosh.

2619
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:37,980
Refresh.

2620
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:39,160
We'll find a different job.

2621
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:40,760
Receptionist.

2622
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:41,420
Refresh.

2623
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,020
Chef, but more money.

2624
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,180
Our last job was 201 per second.

2625
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:48,640
Refresh.

2626
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,520
Driver.

2627
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,360
We're getting there almost.

2628
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,260
Event planner.

2629
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:57,740
Refresh.

2630
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,860
No!

2631
01:41:59,260 --> 01:41:59,860
Event planner.

2632
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:00,280
Refresh.

2633
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,020
We can get...

2634
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:01,300
Oh, oh.

2635
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:01,980
It's going down.

2636
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,680
190.

2637
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,640
Final answer.

2638
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,340
That might be...

2639
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,200
That might be our closest.

2640
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,680
Gosh.

2641
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:14,520
What's...

2642
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,400
This job market is the easiest ever.

2643
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,120
Taya has a new job!

2644
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:18,620
Woohoo!

2645
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,020
Woohoo!

2646
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,080
This game has...

2647
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,740
Sort of language I see in scammy bills.

2648
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,920
Taya has been arguing with parents over trivial matters.

2649
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,220
Time to say goodbye!

2650
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:38,980
Taya continues to experience a worsening relationship with parents.

2651
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:40,820
Sad.

2652
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:41,880
What about this guy?

2653
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,400
He's happy.

2654
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,380
He's way happier than her.

2655
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,680
Yeah, Taya's getting all the drama.

2656
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:53,160
Oh.

2657
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,580
He seems to be suffering from...

2658
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:57,160
From...

2659
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,620
Yellow fever.

2660
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,520
Are we...

2661
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:20,510
Are we...

2662
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:25,890
I'm going to wish for a miracle.

2663
01:43:26,190 --> 01:43:26,610
Don't die.

2664
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:27,870
Uh-oh.

2665
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,610
Feels the condition is worse.

2666
01:43:30,890 --> 01:43:31,570
Dysentery.

2667
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,520
In Mongolia, they have some pretty crazy drinks.

2668
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,020
Ai...

2669
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,300
Ai rag...

2670
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,780
Which is fermented mare's milk.

2671
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,480
And sutei sai...

2672
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,380
Which is salty tea.

2673
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,600
Probably choose the tea.

2674
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:53,220
Tobias is a freak.

2675
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:59,130
It's okay.

2676
01:43:59,130 --> 01:43:59,790
We're still fine.

2677
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:01,970
Now walk it off.

2678
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,550
Yeah, this is Oregon Trail.

2679
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:04,310
Holy cow.

2680
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:08,630
Taya has been replaced by someone else in her position.

2681
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:10,210
Leading to an awkward situation.

2682
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:14,070
Look for opportunities for promotion.

2683
01:44:14,230 --> 01:44:15,030
Develop own skills.

2684
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:15,850
Search for new jobs.

2685
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:17,290
Let's develop our own skills.

2686
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:19,630
Oh.

2687
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:21,890
Taya paid for training to get better skills.

2688
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:22,790
We have so much money.

2689
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:23,270
We can...

2690
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:25,230
We can waste $2,000.

2691
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:26,710
The year is 2019.

2692
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:28,190
The black plague has decreased.

2693
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:28,970
My wife's health.

2694
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:29,830
Points by 20.

2695
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:33,030
I like how we're young, Taya.

2696
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:33,390
Yeah.

2697
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:34,990
We're baby, Taya.

2698
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:35,850
We were just bored.

2699
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:38,250
And suddenly we got married after basketball.

2700
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:42,610
Healthy eating habits.

2701
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:43,550
Become a gym rat.

2702
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:44,570
Drink lots of water.

2703
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:45,090
Do nothing.

2704
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:55,510
Hit the gym.

2705
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:56,610
Gym rat arc.

2706
01:44:57,390 --> 01:45:01,150
Teya gradually shapes her ideal physique through fitness exercises.

2707
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:02,510
Ooh.

2708
01:45:02,970 --> 01:45:03,610
Yeah, baby.

2709
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:04,830
Wait.

2710
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:06,110
What happened to the other baby?

2711
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:20,970
The plague.

2712
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:22,330
The plague.

2713
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,300
I forgot the baby at the hospital.

2714
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:30,680
Clearly.

2715
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:33,760
Teya is anxious about the progress of her project.

2716
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:35,120
Work overtime.

2717
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,360
Request an extension.

2718
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,440
Well, that last time got us in trouble.

2719
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:39,640
So work overtime, baby.

2720
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:41,020
Uh-oh.

2721
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:42,800
She's physically and mentally affected.

2722
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,260
I don't think I know how to.

2723
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:45,980
I'm dead.

2724
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,140
So I don't think I know how to live.

2725
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:47,500
Oh my god.

2726
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:50,260
The baby, Woody, is having issues too.

2727
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:54,600
Woody was scratched by a stray cat while playing in the park.

2728
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,700
Cry on the spot.

2729
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,440
Catch the stray cat.

2730
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:00,580
Why is it like a smirking cat emoji?

2731
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:01,260
Wait.

2732
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:01,680
New pet.

2733
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:06,200
Woody was played around by the wild cat.

2734
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:07,080
Uh-oh.

2735
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,280
Handsome Woody might die, everybody.

2736
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:13,640
Our baby is so handsome.

2737
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,460
What the?

2738
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,820
That is not an elementary student.

2739
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,360
That is a grown-ass man.

2740
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:22,820
What?

2741
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:24,500
Handsome Woody.

2742
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,780
Woody has reached the age to attend elementary school.

2743
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,620
Go to elite private school.

2744
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,500
He's still a deficit in our life.

2745
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:43,920
Tobias is angry because his boss has assigned him unreasonable tasks.

2746
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:45,460
Why does this keep happening?

2747
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:47,620
Weak Tobias?

2748
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:48,540
That's his name?

2749
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:53,340
I thought you guys were just calling him weak earlier because of the...

2750
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,220
Because of the yellow fever.

2751
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:01,540
Punish Tobias.

2752
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:05,300
He seems pretty like...

2753
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:06,420
Soft boy.

2754
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,580
I think he could PN his way out of this.

2755
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:31,990
No!

2756
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:34,210
Tobias was fired!

2757
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,820
Start a business.

2758
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,280
Tobias wants to open a department store in this economy.

2759
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:49,440
What do you mean?

2760
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:52,340
Invest...

2761
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,000
30k?

2762
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:54,140
We don't have that.

2763
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,340
It's just a 1% chance.

2764
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:58,880
Tobias, you're too weak!

2765
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,700
We're going into debt, everybody.

2766
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,380
Tobias opens a department store, but no customers should have.

2767
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:07,920
Oh.

2768
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:09,880
Current balance is...

2769
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:13,620
Minus 9,447k.

2770
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,680
And you will go broke soon.

2771
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:18,240
Um...

2772
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,420
We will borrow $100,000.

2773
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:21,220
Thank you.

2774
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:23,840
How long do you need to repay the loan?

2775
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:24,900
10 years.

2776
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:26,780
Yay!

2777
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:31,060
Well, some people are...

2778
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:35,500
Are...

2779
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,260
Not contributing anything!

2780
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,620
Free 100k.

2781
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:40,420
Let's go, baby!

2782
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,200
Gaming is everything of my life.

2783
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:43,380
Wait.

2784
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,160
Teo finds everyday life monotonous and wants to make a change.

2785
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:48,500
Yeah, gaming.

2786
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:53,040
Teo is greatly affected physically.

2787
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:58,000
What's wrong with Gaby?

2788
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:03,280
Oh my god!

2789
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:10,410
You guys, am I unhappy?

2790
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:12,670
Tobias has found a new job.

2791
01:49:12,810 --> 01:49:12,890
Wait.

2792
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:13,970
Refresh.

2793
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:15,470
80...

2794
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:16,590
Dog walker?

2795
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:17,850
Tobias, you're too weak.

2796
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:19,090
Oh my god.

2797
01:49:19,190 --> 01:49:19,790
We should have never...

2798
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:20,890
We should divorce this man.

2799
01:49:22,610 --> 01:49:25,990
Electrician for only $84 per second is insane.

2800
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:29,670
Gaming wrecked the whole family.

2801
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:32,090
Cleaner for $95.

2802
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:33,210
Okay, accept.

2803
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:35,070
Yeah, Tobias!

2804
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:36,570
Making that money back, baby.

2805
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:37,390
Let's go.

2806
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:40,750
Yeah, per second.

2807
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:46,350
Woody has been overwhelmed with a lot of homework lately and feels exhausted.

2808
01:49:47,150 --> 01:49:48,070
Ask the teacher.

2809
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:49,670
Fill in random answers.

2810
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:50,750
Spend more time.

2811
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:51,490
Discuss with classmates.

2812
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:52,370
Let's ask the teacher.

2813
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:56,690
Woody receives better guidance and correction on his homework.

2814
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:59,290
Completing it faster and reducing the burden.

2815
01:49:59,510 --> 01:49:59,590
Oh!

2816
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:01,370
We made a good choice, you guys.

2817
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:04,550
Chat GPT.

2818
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:05,090
Oh!

2819
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:06,990
Woody doesn't exercise regularly.

2820
01:50:06,990 --> 01:50:08,210
Has a weak immune system.

2821
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:09,950
From his father!

2822
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:16,870
And frequently falls ill.

2823
01:50:17,190 --> 01:50:18,050
Yeah, I wonder why.

2824
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:20,810
I wonder who's making our child sick.

2825
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:25,210
Yellow fever incoming!

2826
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:29,750
Dysentery for all!

2827
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:32,030
Let's stick to an exercise routine.

2828
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:32,790
Oh!

2829
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:34,410
Let's go charming, Woody.

2830
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:37,310
Wait, you're not handsome anymore?

2831
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:38,750
Is it because you grew up?

2832
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:40,750
You were a handsome baby, you know?

2833
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:46,150
Woody failed the last exam in fine arts.

2834
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:49,650
Read the course is spelled wrong.

2835
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:52,210
What should we do?

2836
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:55,710
Weak bloodline confirmed.

2837
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,470
Tobias was our biggest mistake.

2838
01:50:58,570 --> 01:50:59,970
How do you fail art?

2839
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:04,570
What do you mean study with a friend?

2840
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:07,630
Give up?

2841
01:51:07,850 --> 01:51:08,110
Give up.

2842
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:11,490
Woody has made no progress in his studies.

2843
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:12,910
Aw, Woody.

2844
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:15,290
Weak like your father.

2845
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:16,390
Pathetic.

2846
01:51:16,490 --> 01:51:17,210
Pathetic, Woody.

2847
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:18,310
That should be your new name.

2848
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:20,850
Oh my gosh, Woody is going through it.

2849
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:24,450
Woody's grades and career and technical education have declined.

2850
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:26,450
Give up!

2851
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:27,150
Give up!

2852
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:32,270
We'll redo.

2853
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:35,110
Woody has improved his grades!

2854
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:37,970
He did it.

2855
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:39,990
I'm mean tonight.

2856
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:42,150
I'm just, uh...

2857
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:43,790
I just wanted to cause a little chaos.

2858
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:46,130
Woody brought his girlfriend...

2859
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:47,210
How old are you, Woody?

2860
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:48,810
I thought you were in elementary school.

2861
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:51,110
He brought a girlfriend home.

2862
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:53,810
Warn them they are too young for that.

2863
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:56,430
Tell Woody's girlfriend to get lost.

2864
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:58,570
Hey, didn't you have two babies?

2865
01:51:58,910 --> 01:51:59,450
I don't know.

2866
01:51:59,570 --> 01:52:00,390
Where the other baby...

2867
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:01,090
I think we...

2868
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:02,970
I think the other baby...

2869
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:03,950
We left at the hospital.

2870
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,820
Hey Woody, that's our girlfriend.

2871
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:18,050
Ignore them.

2872
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:19,290
Ignore them.

2873
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:24,230
Tell Woody's girlfriend to get lost.

2874
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:26,750
Oh, that's it.

2875
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,670
That's all that happened.

2876
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:28,750
Do you think if she...

2877
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,250
If we welcomed her, she would be...

2878
01:52:31,530 --> 01:52:33,650
She would be...

2879
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,590
In our family tree.

2880
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:37,530
Taya believes her salary is unfair.

2881
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:40,570
Wait, what's a 70% chance of salary raise?

2882
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:40,950
Let's go.

2883
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:52,510
Taya seems to be suffering from...

2884
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:54,930
Hypoglycemia.

2885
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:05,300
Wish for a miracle.

2886
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,360
Wish for a miracle.

2887
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:09,040
Oh.

2888
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,600
Taya feels the condition is worse.

2889
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:14,420
I don't think we have very good luck with this family.

2890
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,580
Woody considers whether to do homework.

2891
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,520
Conscientiously complete homework.

2892
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:29,060
Refuse to do homework.

2893
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:30,180
I like these emojis.

2894
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,880
Do your homework, Woody.

2895
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,220
Come on, Woody.

2896
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:34,780
Gosh.

2897
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:35,560
Oh.

2898
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:38,200
Woody has reached the age to attend middle...

2899
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:38,480
See?

2900
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:42,040
He was an elementary school student getting a girlfriend.

2901
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,280
What?

2902
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:44,520
What?

2903
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:48,340
Oh.

2904
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:49,480
This is the date?

2905
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:51,680
So it's...

2906
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,000
Is it January 3rd?

2907
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:53,860
It's 2030?

2908
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:55,260
Wait.

2909
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:56,080
Is that the date?

2910
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,200
Um.

2911
01:53:59,320 --> 01:53:59,660
Damn.

2912
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,280
Okay.

2913
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:01,820
You're going to a public middle school.

2914
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:04,060
Charming, Woody.

2915
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,840
Oh.

2916
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:07,280
I see.

2917
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:07,760
Yeah.

2918
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:10,200
So it's April 17th, 2030.

2919
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,800
I thought that was just the timer.

2920
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,900
Man's got riz.

2921
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,580
Teya is overwhelmed by work pressure and feels exhausted every day.

2922
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:22,640
Find ways to relax.

2923
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,100
Come on.

2924
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:25,100
We were weak, Teya.

2925
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:26,160
Now we're young, Teya.

2926
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:29,260
It worked.

2927
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:29,960
But we're still...

2928
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,040
Oh.

2929
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:30,420
Wait.

2930
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:32,080
It's happy Tobias now.

2931
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:32,440
Okay.

2932
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:38,760
Woody found that a classmate was cheating on it.

2933
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:39,680
No snitching.

2934
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,440
Turn a blind eye.

2935
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,700
Woody focused on his own studies.

2936
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:45,780
Good Woody.

2937
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:54,400
Woody is expensive, you guys.

2938
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,400
I'm just going to say that right out.

2939
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,160
Woody is pretty pricey.

2940
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:01,900
Woody stays up late and sleeps very late.

2941
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,860
Continue staying up late.

2942
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:07,290
Yeah, his health worsens.

2943
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,500
Mama didn't raise no snitch.

2944
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:11,020
Yeah.

2945
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:12,100
Tobias.

2946
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:15,900
Tobias, become a gym rat just like your wife.

2947
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:18,020
Happy Tobias.

2948
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,360
The gym rat arc.

2949
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,040
What if we could sell Woody to make a profit?

2950
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,920
I think that would be the good option.

2951
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,800
He's not a good investment.

2952
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:34,640
This is a capitalistic society.

2953
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:38,440
Woody always gets poor education in business.

2954
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:39,560
Sell him.

2955
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:40,900
Sell him.

2956
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:42,860
Redo the course.

2957
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:44,420
Oh, he has improved.

2958
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:44,900
Good job.

2959
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:46,700
Wait, is he old now?

2960
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,020
No, he's charming, Woody.

2961
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:56,310
Tobias feels frustrated because his colleagues frequently disrupt his work.

2962
01:55:56,970 --> 01:55:58,190
Yells at him.

2963
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:02,150
Yells at him.

2964
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:03,810
Communicate with colleagues.

2965
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:05,530
Report the situation to superiors.

2966
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:06,770
I can stand that.

2967
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:08,270
Yells at him.

2968
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:12,630
Tobias, it's time for you to become angry, Tobias.

2969
01:56:12,970 --> 01:56:13,330
Yell.

2970
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:17,990
The colleague realizes his mistake, apologizes, and promises not to do it again.

2971
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:19,830
Oh my god, wait, it worked?

2972
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:24,810
That worked?

2973
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:25,830
How?

2974
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:27,910
Woody has reached high school already?

2975
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:31,550
Woody, you're too expensive.

2976
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:32,910
Public high school for you.

2977
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:35,850
Public high...

2978
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:37,590
When are you going to bring home a girlfriend, though, Woody?

2979
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:38,090
Come on.

2980
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:43,650
Social studies grades have declined.

2981
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:44,730
Redo.

2982
01:56:45,370 --> 01:56:46,030
Good job.

2983
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:48,270
I think redoing it works every time.

2984
01:56:49,010 --> 01:56:52,730
Woody is not good at arts or business or social studies or anything.

2985
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:56,930
Oh, Woody.

2986
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:59,370
Woody dislikes doing chores and finds them boring.

2987
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:01,230
Do chores or get beaten.

2988
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:08,210
Oh my god!

2989
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:21,030
We're building character here.

2990
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:23,990
Charming Woody?

2991
01:57:24,530 --> 01:57:24,710
No.

2992
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:25,970
Punished Woody.

2993
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:30,130
Woody is gradually accepting the arrangement of household chores.

2994
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,090
It worked!

2995
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:34,530
What the happiness went up to?

2996
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:37,890
Wait.

2997
01:57:38,990 --> 01:57:40,370
Teya's picture changed.

2998
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:42,110
Woody failed his last exam inside.

2999
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:43,690
This guy can't do anything!

3000
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:45,290
Redo.

3001
01:57:47,030 --> 01:57:48,070
He can't do...

3002
01:57:48,070 --> 01:57:48,270
Look!

3003
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,270
Oh, we're middle-aged Teya.

3004
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:53,790
And happy Tobias.

3005
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:57,670
Why is she middle-aged and he's happy?

3006
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:01,830
Okay.

3007
01:58:02,670 --> 01:58:04,010
Is anything else gonna happen?

3008
01:58:05,570 --> 01:58:07,550
Tobias wants to buy a lottery ticket.

3009
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:09,090
Ticket costs $9.

3010
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:11,890
Jackpot...

3011
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:17,450
Buy 10.

3012
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:19,970
Tobias did not win.

3013
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,340
This is like a buy 90 bucks.

3014
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,900
How long have we had this...

3015
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,480
this loan for?

3016
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:36,240
Woody's classmates were all using luxury cosmetics.

3017
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:38,940
Continue using cheap makeup.

3018
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,680
Steal a classmate's makeup.

3019
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:41,240
Steal.

3020
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:42,640
Oh!

3021
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,240
It worked!

3022
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:44,540
We didn't get in trouble at all.

3023
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,460
There was no punishment.

3024
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:50,060
Woody!

3025
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:50,860
Woody!

3026
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:52,480
Poor grades and health!

3027
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:53,360
Oh my gosh!

3028
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:54,520
Do you study anything?

3029
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:55,300
What are you...

3030
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,200
What are you doing?

3031
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:00,560
$4,000 for makeup.

3032
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:01,780
That's insane.

3033
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:04,600
Woody is anxious about his upcoming school competition.

3034
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:05,860
Give up.

3035
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,620
Practice more.

3036
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:07,140
Do nothing.

3037
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:08,280
Practice.

3038
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:11,420
Good job, Woody.

3039
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,400
He has no redeeming qualities.

3040
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:14,060
Oh!

3041
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,580
Tobias seems to be suffering from eczema.

3042
01:59:21,580 --> 01:59:23,160
Me too, Tobias.

3043
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:27,380
Oh my god, no, Tobias.

3044
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:29,580
Don't die from eczema, please.

3045
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:35,540
Wish for a miracle.

3046
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,600
It worsens.

3047
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:38,340
What?

3048
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,820
How is this condition?

3049
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:41,160
It's eczema.

3050
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,780
The lethal eczema.

3051
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:49,040
Our wife is going to think we're ugly.

3052
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:49,720
No.

3053
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:52,880
Oh my god.

3054
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:53,100
Wait.

3055
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:54,620
Woody has a lot of charm.

3056
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:01,060
And also costs a lot of freaky...

3057
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:01,340
Wait.

3058
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:04,320
Woody costs almost as much money as we make.

3059
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,040
Welcome Woody's classmates warmly.

3060
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:09,420
Okay.

3061
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:10,760
Wait.

3062
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:14,420
We're not making any money, you guys.

3063
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:18,180
Uh-oh.

3064
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:23,790
That died from the yellow fever eggs.

3065
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:24,150
What?

3066
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:29,690
Um.

3067
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:31,010
You're not going to university.

3068
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:32,910
You are working, baby.

3069
02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:35,330
No.

3070
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:36,490
Why are you still...

3071
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:37,430
A deficit?

3072
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:38,330
Oh my god.

3073
02:00:38,490 --> 02:00:38,910
Look at...

3074
02:00:38,910 --> 02:00:39,930
We're losing money.

3075
02:00:41,130 --> 02:00:42,090
A streamer!

3076
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:56,770
Woody found a new job as a streamer.

3077
02:00:56,770 --> 02:00:58,190
He's making...

3078
02:00:58,770 --> 02:00:59,990
More than our mom.

3079
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:01,850
Wait.

3080
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:05,090
Middle-aged Taya wants to go on a trip.

3081
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:06,430
We don't have...

3082
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:07,790
Fly to the moon?

3083
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:09,510
Wait.

3084
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:11,810
What do you mean there's a 50% chance...

3085
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:14,690
Of dying?

3086
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:16,230
Found

3087
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:24,710
the footprint of Armstrong on the moon.

3088
02:01:25,130 --> 02:01:25,450
Oh.

3089
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:26,930
We are in excessive debt.

3090
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:30,770
Your family survived until 2030...

3091
02:01:30,770 --> 02:01:31,270
They died!

3092
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:36,230
We died from debt, everybody.

3093
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:39,610
We died.

3094
02:01:42,610 --> 02:01:43,930
That was so sad.

3095
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:45,650
Died of debt.

3096
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:48,790
Our family survived until 2037.

3097
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:51,050
You know what?

3098
02:01:51,790 --> 02:01:53,490
It's longer than I expected.

3099
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:55,390
I'm not going to lie.

3100
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:58,070
Probably shouldn't have gone to the moon.

3101
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:59,350
But it was worth it.

3102
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:02,770
She saw Armstrong's footprint on the moon.

3103
02:02:04,370 --> 02:02:06,710
What is this alien shooter?

3104
02:02:07,410 --> 02:02:08,050
Whoa.

3105
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:10,530
What other games we got in here?

3106
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:11,270
Cat...

3107
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:11,630
Wait.

3108
02:02:11,770 --> 02:02:13,210
Magic Cat Academy.

3109
02:02:15,090 --> 02:02:16,610
Adorable Home.

3110
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:19,010
Merge Hero.

3111
02:02:19,010 --> 02:02:19,090
Bro.

3112
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:21,010
These are so much like the ads.

3113
02:02:26,190 --> 02:02:29,630
Do you guys want to play Foot Chinko or Homo Evolution?

3114
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:39,900
Do you want to play Foot Chinko or Homo Evolution?

3115
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:45,240
Which one?

3116
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:47,960
No skills in arts.

3117
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,160
Business science.

3118
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:49,980
Has health issues.

3119
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,100
No university prospects.

3120
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:52,640
Perfect streamer material.

3121
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,360
Actually, though...

3122
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,760
Time to evolve.

3123
02:02:58,060 --> 02:02:58,160
Time to evolve.

3124
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,040
This one has...

3125
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,080
6.5 million plays.

3126
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:05,240
I wonder which one has the most plays on it.

3127
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,600
Oh, wait.

3128
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:07,460
These are for me.

3129
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:08,120
Wait.

3130
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:10,420
Uh...

3131
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,960
What is skincare time?

3132
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:12,580
This looks...

3133
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:14,100
This looks like some, like, Elsa...

3134
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:16,840
Pimple poppin'.

3135
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,260
You know...

3136
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:20,000
Booger...

3137
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:21,900
Booger wiping.

3138
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,300
Kind of nastiness, you know?

3139
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:31,130
Phantom is you.

3140
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:32,190
Yeah.

3141
02:03:32,710 --> 02:03:32,870
Yeah.

3142
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:36,310
Are you a bot?

3143
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:40,590
At least these have no ads.

3144
02:03:40,810 --> 02:03:41,350
I know, right?

3145
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:42,550
Angry Birds?

3146
02:03:42,910 --> 02:03:44,370
Do we Angry Birds time?

3147
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:45,210
I feel like...

3148
02:03:45,210 --> 02:03:47,250
We could always play Angry Birds whenever...

3149
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:49,350
Let's see...

3150
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:51,070
I keep seeing...

3151
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:53,150
I keep wanting to play this because it has a dinosaur.

3152
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:54,810
But then I see it's just a merge game.

3153
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:56,710
Then Crossy Road.

3154
02:03:57,590 --> 02:03:58,890
I've seen that one before.

3155
02:03:59,150 --> 02:03:59,610
What's this?

3156
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:00,810
Oh, Scavenger Hunt.

3157
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:05,780
Woody may have died on the moon.

3158
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,460
But it was worth it for the content.

3159
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:10,000
I should go to the moon then.

3160
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:11,380
50% chance, baby!

3161
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:14,540
I might...

3162
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:15,220
Live!

3163
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:16,720
Well, I'm already dead.

3164
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:19,960
State.io online PvP.

3165
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:23,820
I feel like that might...

3166
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:25,240
Not be good.

3167
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,200
If it's like...

3168
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,380
Hi, you're in this state.

3169
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,180
Pirate Pop.

3170
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:35,540
Foot Chinko.

3171
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,260
Oh, that's the Flappy Foot Chinko.

3172
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,620
Lake Jump.

3173
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:43,040
Minesweep.

3174
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:44,820
Wait, Classic Minesweeper?

3175
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,700
Sushi Roll.

3176
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:48,260
Trivia Crack.

3177
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:50,680
Ringy Dingy.

3178
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,380
Wait, is this like a...

3179
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:53,100
What's it called?

3180
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:53,320
Game?

3181
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:56,820
Oh, Rhythm Game?

3182
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:58,960
Boss, what if the moon is sentient?

3183
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:18,790
What?

3184
02:05:21,010 --> 02:05:21,850
Swipe.

3185
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:29,110
Is this a tutorial?

3186
02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:38,340
The Pokeball.

3187
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:46,580
Oh.

3188
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:48,980
Oh.

3189
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:56,840
Oh.

3190
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:58,960
Wait, am I doing it right?

3191
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:02,840
I don't like the sound it makes.

3192
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:04,860
Oh.

3193
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:12,960
Let me turn it down.

3194
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:16,000
I thought it was going to be a...

3195
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,840
Rhythm Game.

3196
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,320
I can't tell what the size of these things are.

3197
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,440
Exaling.

3198
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:27,540
Oh.

3199
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:28,640
Uh oh.

3200
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:29,600
Oh!

3201
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:31,100
Oh, I made it!

3202
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:32,140
oops.

3203
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:48,570
Okay, I think I understand now.

3204
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:54,450
Oh, I get it.

3205
02:06:55,210 --> 02:06:59,210
Oh, it even shows me where I can place it.

3206
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:01,770
It's not entirely stupid.

3207
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:03,730
Wait, shouldn't this be a cross?

3208
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:04,270
Come on.

3209
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:06,530
Color stack.

3210
02:07:07,250 --> 02:07:08,290
Okay, I'm done with this one.

3211
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:11,750
I didn't like it.

3212
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,730
I didn't like that one.

3213
02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:20,210
I want to build a queen, baby.

3214
02:07:20,410 --> 02:07:21,510
Let's build a queen.

3215
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:26,820
Play magic cat.

3216
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:28,980
Yeah, I was not impressed.

3217
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:30,280
That one.

3218
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:31,260
Oh.

3219
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:40,480
Oh, we... I did test this one before.

3220
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:43,340
Oops.

3221
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:49,500
I kind of... just to see if these games were actually playable.

3222
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:51,200
Use this.

3223
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:51,700
Oh, okay.

3224
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:53,080
Thank you, game.

3225
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:56,480
So you're supposed to build the person that is on the right.

3226
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:00,100
Um... Like, the top right.

3227
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:01,960
I made her head really big, though.

3228
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:06,140
Oh, I... Yeah, I think we still got this.

3229
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:08,180
Oh.

3230
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:08,540
Oh.

3231
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:09,880
Oh.

3232
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:10,400
Oh, my God.

3233
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,710
We still got the man.

3234
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:18,190
Okay.

3235
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:20,070
Now it's getting interesting.

3236
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:21,910
Wow.

3237
02:08:22,190 --> 02:08:22,310
Oh.

3238
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:23,470
Oh, theme is my...

3239
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:25,210
Style.

3240
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:28,470
Um... Let's go with a redhead.

3241
02:08:29,330 --> 02:08:30,230
Oh, yeah.

3242
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:30,510
Oh.

3243
02:08:30,730 --> 02:08:30,890
Nope.

3244
02:08:31,110 --> 02:08:32,230
Those are not my style.

3245
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:32,770
Oh.

3246
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:35,110
Let's go with some pink shoes.

3247
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:36,470
These shoes.

3248
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:37,910
Money.

3249
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:43,390
Pink.

3250
02:08:44,670 --> 02:08:45,430
Pink.

3251
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:47,330
Pink.

3252
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:48,570
Money.

3253
02:08:50,630 --> 02:08:51,430
Oh, yeah.

3254
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:53,230
This is a game.

3255
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:54,710
What is that?

3256
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:54,950
Oh.

3257
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:55,970
I just put that on.

3258
02:08:56,230 --> 02:08:56,350
Oh.

3259
02:08:56,850 --> 02:08:58,330
Uh, put on eye shadow.

3260
02:08:59,870 --> 02:09:00,430
Okay.

3261
02:09:00,750 --> 02:09:01,310
Oh, my God.

3262
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:03,270
Okay.

3263
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:05,670
Did I do it?

3264
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:18,610
The quality of these games really just...

3265
02:09:20,110 --> 02:09:20,970
Stunns you, huh?

3266
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:21,570
Oh.

3267
02:09:21,950 --> 02:09:21,950
Oh.

3268
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:23,090
Theme is summer.

3269
02:09:23,770 --> 02:09:24,390
Oh, my God.

3270
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:25,550
She's booking it.

3271
02:09:25,770 --> 02:09:26,230
This one.

3272
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:29,090
Can I run?

3273
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:30,870
Can I please run?

3274
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:31,450
Oh.

3275
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:32,770
This one.

3276
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:33,810
Oh, my gosh.

3277
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:34,650
The hat.

3278
02:09:34,910 --> 02:09:35,130
Wait.

3279
02:09:35,230 --> 02:09:36,370
She stole my outfit.

3280
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:39,550
Why do we have the same outfit on?

3281
02:09:40,070 --> 02:09:41,230
Uh, eye shadow.

3282
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:42,170
Okay.

3283
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:42,890
Uh.

3284
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:43,550
Okay.

3285
02:09:43,730 --> 02:09:43,810
Oh.

3286
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:45,430
Wait.

3287
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:45,870
Uh-oh.

3288
02:09:46,350 --> 02:09:47,270
What do we do?

3289
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:52,520
We look the same.

3290
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:58,800
I lost.

3291
02:09:59,200 --> 02:09:59,380
Wait.

3292
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:01,400
Is that the one we were supposed to do?

3293
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,520
Why is she up there?

3294
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:07,470
She's like up there in heaven.

3295
02:10:08,650 --> 02:10:09,170
Okay.

3296
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:11,150
I think I'm good with build a coin.

3297
02:10:13,450 --> 02:10:14,490
I think I'm good.

3298
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,030
She copied me.

3299
02:10:17,610 --> 02:10:19,450
I like blue for summer.

3300
02:10:20,630 --> 02:10:22,510
Yellow for summer for sure.

3301
02:10:22,970 --> 02:10:23,190
No.

3302
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:25,410
Blue is so much better.

3303
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:27,170
I kind of want to play family life again.

3304
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:27,890
I'm not going to lie.

3305
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:29,970
That was kind of awesome.

3306
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:30,710
Cat escape.

3307
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:31,370
Let's do...

3308
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:33,810
I'm trying to find the ones that I have like the most plays.

3309
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,990
Like this one, Racemaster, has 31 million plays.

3310
02:10:37,530 --> 02:10:39,470
Now it's 32 million.

3311
02:10:43,170 --> 02:10:44,410
Hold to ride.

3312
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:45,890
Okay.

3313
02:10:51,490 --> 02:10:53,230
How do I speed up?

3314
02:10:54,450 --> 02:10:55,450
Can I drift?

3315
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:57,310
Okay.

3316
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:58,750
How do I get faster?

3317
02:10:59,250 --> 02:10:59,950
Oh my god.

3318
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:00,710
There's bouncy balls.

3319
02:11:01,050 --> 02:11:01,990
What the hell?

3320
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:03,490
How do I get faster?

3321
02:11:03,730 --> 02:11:04,170
Oh my god.

3322
02:11:04,230 --> 02:11:04,610
There's sheep.

3323
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:06,210
Oh my god.

3324
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:07,270
Oh yeah, baby.

3325
02:11:09,370 --> 02:11:10,410
I'm getting faster.

3326
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:11,090
I'm going.

3327
02:11:11,490 --> 02:11:11,770
Ah!

3328
02:11:12,430 --> 02:11:13,770
I crashed and I died.

3329
02:11:14,230 --> 02:11:14,330
Okay.

3330
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:18,180
Is this Rocket League?

3331
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:18,640
Maybe.

3332
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:21,320
Bouncy balls.

3333
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,420
Me, me, me, me, me.

3334
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:32,350
I finished the race.

3335
02:11:34,510 --> 02:11:35,650
Cute mouse pointer.

3336
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:36,350
Thank you.

3337
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:40,150
How does this have so many...

3338
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:46,010
So many plays.

3339
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:47,170
Oh my god.

3340
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:48,130
Oh, they're losing control.

3341
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:48,950
Oh my god.

3342
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:50,490
Holy cow.

3343
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:02,270
Oh my gosh.

3344
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:04,890
Bouncy balls.

3345
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:06,210
Oh my gosh.

3346
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:06,890
Wait, you guys.

3347
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:07,830
We might make it the first.

3348
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:14,250
We're in first.

3349
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:16,010
Oh my god.

3350
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:17,930
The bouncy ball.

3351
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:24,470
This is what kids play on their computer these days.

3352
02:12:24,630 --> 02:12:25,150
Clearly.

3353
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:34,440
Let's invest in...

3354
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:37,880
Yeah.

3355
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:39,560
Yeah, baby.

3356
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:44,930
Look at that.

3357
02:12:45,230 --> 02:12:45,750
Oh, whoops.

3358
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:47,590
Look at that little beetle.

3359
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:49,410
I

3360
02:13:11,890 --> 02:13:13,030
maybe deserve that.

3361
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:17,210
I maybe deserve that.

3362
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:29,360
I can drive really well, you guys.

3363
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,780
This is not a testament, okay?

3364
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:35,220
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.

3365
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:35,620
Sorry.

3366
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,700
I was looking at that really long name.

3367
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:42,960
I'll still make money.

3368
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:46,740
It doesn't matter what place I am.

3369
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:51,390
Oh gosh, I was so late.

3370
02:13:51,490 --> 02:13:52,370
They were waiting for me.

3371
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:54,830
Yikes.

3372
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:01,750
Top speed.

3373
02:14:02,150 --> 02:14:03,930
Oh, I maybe should have done more acceleration.

3374
02:14:05,770 --> 02:14:06,250
Whatever.

3375
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:10,620
My Oshii should not be behind the wheel.

3376
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:11,660
No, it's good.

3377
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:12,020
It's good.

3378
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:12,460
It's good.

3379
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:14,440
Accelerate.

3380
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:15,280
Yeah.

3381
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:16,140
Oh.

3382
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:17,480
Oh.

3383
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:19,420
Oh.

3384
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:20,060
Accelerate.

3385
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:21,420
We can catch up.

3386
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:22,300
It's still early.

3387
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,580
It's anyone's game.

3388
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:26,660
Maybe.

3389
02:14:30,700 --> 02:14:31,400
See, see, see.

3390
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:33,320
I'm already almost up.

3391
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:34,800
Caught to them.

3392
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:35,520
Whoa.

3393
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,780
We're doing twists and turns.

3394
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:39,080
Whoa.

3395
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:39,860
Whoa.

3396
02:14:40,780 --> 02:14:42,000
I'm almost caught up.

3397
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:43,520
I'm caught up.

3398
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:46,220
Oh, they fall.

3399
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:47,260
Oh, they're stupid.

3400
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:48,900
I'm already in second place.

3401
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:52,000
I'm so good at this game.

3402
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:53,680
I'm so good at this game.

3403
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:02,820
I'm good at this game.

3404
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,020
Boss fight.

3405
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:12,260
Oh, we have to collect things to get the boss fight.

3406
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:15,000
Let's do more acceleration.

3407
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:17,860
We don't need handling.

3408
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:21,600
Handling is all me, baby.

3409
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:23,520
I handle it.

3410
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:26,740
What the hell?

3411
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:27,540
Space invader.

3412
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:30,500
Whoa, we're in Tetris world.

3413
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,500
What in the vapor wave is this?

3414
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:33,480
Oh, hey.

3415
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:34,480
Oh, my gosh.

3416
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:38,500
They're trying to kill me.

3417
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:39,540
They're trying to kill me.

3418
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:40,580
Oh, my God.

3419
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,340
There's a doggy dog world out there.

3420
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,440
I'm going to do racing games in real life.

3421
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:06,320
I'm going to become a street racer and do exactly like this.

3422
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:08,720
See you, sucker.

3423
02:16:18,250 --> 02:16:19,270
I'm too good.

3424
02:16:19,590 --> 02:16:21,270
We unlocked the RGV.

3425
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:25,500
Let's go, RGV.

3426
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:26,860
What is this?

3427
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:32,920
I think this is probably, if it's a mobile game, you can adjust.

3428
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:41,630
Oh, yeah.

3429
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:42,890
That guy's T-posing on me.

3430
02:16:44,130 --> 02:16:44,870
They're clapping.

3431
02:16:45,570 --> 02:16:46,250
More acceleration.

3432
02:16:49,590 --> 02:16:50,990
Are any of these games legit?

3433
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:52,730
I don't know.

3434
02:16:52,890 --> 02:16:53,370
You tell me.

3435
02:16:59,630 --> 02:17:00,690
Everybody's going crazy.

3436
02:17:01,050 --> 02:17:01,530
The L.

3437
02:17:04,030 --> 02:17:05,110
This one's kind of addicted.

3438
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:05,770
I'm not going to lie.

3439
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:07,950
This one's kind of fun.

3440
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:09,250
Hey!

3441
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:10,650
I'm going to kill you.

3442
02:17:10,910 --> 02:17:13,210
I'm going to murder you off the road.

3443
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:33,290
I'm already caught up.

3444
02:17:33,390 --> 02:17:34,590
Because I'm so good at this game.

3445
02:17:37,170 --> 02:17:37,590
This

3446
02:17:48,650 --> 02:17:48,850
one.

3447
02:17:49,250 --> 02:17:50,630
We did, in fact, need handling.

3448
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:51,070
No!

3449
02:17:51,470 --> 02:17:51,750
We...

3450
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:53,850
No, we didn't.

3451
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:55,830
No, we didn't.

3452
02:17:56,150 --> 02:17:59,050
Okay, I got to know what fork and sausage is.

3453
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,010
You are amazing.

3454
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:00,790
Thanks, Link.

3455
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:03,490
Thank you.

3456
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:06,570
My name is Mitt Phantom, and welcome to Jackass.

3457
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:07,930
Bow, bow, bow.

3458
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:15,680
Oh, yeah.

3459
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:18,300
Oh!

3460
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:25,260
Out of curiosity, are you friends with a headless motorcycle rider with a yellow helmet?

3461
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:29,340
More than friends.

3462
02:18:46,290 --> 02:18:47,570
Oh, it already fell.

3463
02:18:48,630 --> 02:18:50,210
So I didn't even do anything.

3464
02:18:50,730 --> 02:18:51,630
Oh, they suck.

3465
02:18:58,890 --> 02:19:00,010
It's kind of hard.

3466
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:03,010
Uh-oh.

3467
02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:06,130
Oh, no.

3468
02:19:06,390 --> 02:19:07,590
I am stuck in here.

3469
02:19:08,390 --> 02:19:09,350
Oh, my gosh.

3470
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:11,410
Wait, I don't understand the physics at all, I think.

3471
02:19:12,570 --> 02:19:13,670
Oh, my gosh.

3472
02:19:13,670 --> 02:19:14,290
Oh, my gosh.

3473
02:19:14,470 --> 02:19:14,490
I don't understand the physics at all, I think.

3474
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,100
You can spam click.

3475
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:21,220
Oh, I did it.

3476
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:27,240
I'm surprised they don't give you, like, a certain number of tries, you know?

3477
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:28,540
Surprise box.

3478
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:30,840
Hot dog.

3479
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:32,540
Pudding.

3480
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:41,500
Oh, whoa.

3481
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:44,160
The pudding does way more than I expected.

3482
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:47,220
Oh, oh, oh.

3483
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:49,920
That sounds kind of fun.

3484
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:53,820
Boing.

3485
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:54,740
Boing.

3486
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:58,300
Boing.

3487
02:19:59,180 --> 02:19:59,880
Boing.

3488
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:01,440
Boing.

3489
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:04,380
Bozingo.

3490
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:05,460
Bozingo.

3491
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:05,980
Bozingo.

3492
02:20:05,980 --> 02:20:06,040
Bozingo.

3493
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:06,220
Bozingo.

3494
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:06,340
Bozingo.

3495
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:06,920
Bozingo.

3496
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:07,600
Bozingo.

3497
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:07,860
Bozingo.

3498
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:08,760
Bozingo.

3499
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:08,920
Bozingo.

3500
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:18,900
Bozingo.

3501
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:21,600
Bozingo.

3502
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:22,160
Bozingo.

3503
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:22,380
Bozingo.

3504
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:22,540
Bozingo.

3505
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:22,880
Bozingo.

3506
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:23,160
Bozingo.

3507
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:28,910
Oh, we got a key here.

3508
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:29,970
Oops.

3509
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:30,970
How did you miss?

3510
02:20:31,570 --> 02:20:32,730
How did you miss?

3511
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:38,530
Toaster.

3512
02:20:39,990 --> 02:20:42,810
Not much of a surprise if we see it on the bottom.

3513
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:54,910
That was clean.

3514
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:56,150
That was fun.

3515
02:20:57,750 --> 02:20:59,070
What else should we do, guys?

3516
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:01,070
What else should we do?

3517
02:21:01,570 --> 02:21:03,830
I kind of want to go back to the family one.

3518
02:21:06,770 --> 02:21:08,170
Can you sing happy birthday for me?

3519
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:10,870
I'm not doing birthday songs right now, but happy birthday, Link.

3520
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:11,670
Happy, happy birthday.

3521
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:16,200
Cut the rope.

3522
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,940
I see twisted tangle.

3523
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:21,100
Was there a cut the rope?

3524
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:26,120
Oh my gosh, this one's also intelligence challenge.

3525
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:30,420
This one's also like those ads.

3526
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:33,920
Prison life?

3527
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:36,100
We did that one already earlier.

3528
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:37,640
Yeah, yeah.

3529
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:40,160
Merge cakes.

3530
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:41,940
Down, cut the rope.

3531
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:43,920
Cut the rope.

3532
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:45,700
Cut the rope.

3533
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:48,530
Oh wait.

3534
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:50,690
Let's try Magic Cat Academy.

3535
02:21:51,390 --> 02:21:52,070
Are those ghosts?

3536
02:21:54,710 --> 02:21:56,190
Oh wait, there's a cut scene?

3537
02:21:58,350 --> 02:21:59,570
Ha ha ha.

3538
02:22:00,330 --> 02:22:00,670
Me!

3539
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:08,730
Wait, this is so fancy.

3540
02:22:14,830 --> 02:22:16,850
Oh, uh, what did it say?

3541
02:22:17,730 --> 02:22:18,150
Uh oh.

3542
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:23,870
Defeated ghosts by drawing its symbol anywhere.

3543
02:22:24,490 --> 02:22:24,730
Ah!

3544
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:28,450
Oh, that's kind of fun.

3545
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:29,010
Ha!

3546
02:22:30,930 --> 02:22:32,010
Level one.

3547
02:22:32,370 --> 02:22:32,590
Oh!

3548
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:34,830
Draw!

3549
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:41,840
Oh, I see.

3550
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:47,150
Whoa!

3551
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:52,740
Oh, I see.

3552
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:57,520
Whoa.

3553
02:22:58,700 --> 02:22:59,500
What

3554
02:23:05,380 --> 02:23:06,500
the hell is this math?

3555
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:10,020
Oh my god.

3556
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:11,180
Oh.

3557
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:15,640
Oh my god.

3558
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:16,980
These are getting crazy.

3559
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:20,420
No!

3560
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:22,640
We lost a house.

3561
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:25,740
These are crazy.

3562
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:27,040
These are crazy.

3563
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:30,660
Is it...

3564
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:31,560
It's my own kind.

3565
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:32,940
Yeah, but this cat...

3566
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,720
Cat is important.

3567
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:36,180
Draw!

3568
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:38,120
Friend!

3569
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:42,780
Wait.

3570
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:53,910
What if we draw a mint symbol?

3571
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:55,010
What's that?

3572
02:23:57,630 --> 02:23:58,330
Oh gosh.

3573
02:24:01,730 --> 02:24:02,570
What is this one?

3574
02:24:03,710 --> 02:24:04,590
If I draw...

3575
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:05,230
Oh, I was gonna say.

3576
02:24:05,290 --> 02:24:06,550
If I draw a heart, will it...

3577
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:07,110
Will it work?

3578
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:09,110
Ha!

3579
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:16,510
I guess this is way easier with your finger, huh?

3580
02:24:17,090 --> 02:24:17,470
You know?

3581
02:24:21,630 --> 02:24:22,630
I imagine.

3582
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:34,720
Because I feel...

3583
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,020
Tricky...

3584
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:37,880
With my...

3585
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:39,240
With my...

3586
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:39,420
Ah!

3587
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:40,180
Ah!

3588
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:40,600
Ah!

3589
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:42,340
Ah!

3590
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:43,800
My god is ass.

3591
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:45,680
I feel tricky with my mouse.

3592
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:49,040
Cart was a bonus after the boss.

3593
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:49,740
Oh!

3594
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:52,460
Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.

3595
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:54,100
It was hard on mobile too?

3596
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:54,660
Really?

3597
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:54,920
Level 3!

3598
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:56,540
Level 3.

3599
02:24:57,320 --> 02:24:58,460
Oh my gosh.

3600
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:05,190
They get really...

3601
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:05,870
Oh my gosh.

3602
02:25:12,410 --> 02:25:14,370
Wait, I'm gonna write a message to you guys.

3603
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:22,250
Wait, what'd that do?

3604
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:28,250
Oh, that's so cute!

3605
02:25:28,610 --> 02:25:29,750
Shut up, really?

3606
02:25:31,730 --> 02:25:33,590
It actually works!

3607
02:25:37,370 --> 02:25:38,510
Oh my gosh!

3608
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:44,110
That's so cute!

3609
02:25:49,030 --> 02:25:49,790
Nice.

3610
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:51,810
Nice.

3611
02:25:52,070 --> 02:25:52,950
Oh no, the boss.

3612
02:25:55,430 --> 02:25:57,370
The boss, the boss, the boss, the boss.

3613
02:25:58,290 --> 02:25:58,810
Ah!

3614
02:25:59,190 --> 02:25:59,290
Ah!

3615
02:25:59,550 --> 02:26:00,290
Oh, shoot.

3616
02:26:04,050 --> 02:26:05,930
Stay away, foul beast!

3617
02:26:07,770 --> 02:26:09,250
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3618
02:26:09,810 --> 02:26:11,030
He's too fast!

3619
02:26:14,210 --> 02:26:15,070
He's fast.

3620
02:26:16,170 --> 02:26:18,330
Dang, I carved your symbol on my wall.

3621
02:26:18,530 --> 02:26:19,230
What do you mean?

3622
02:26:23,130 --> 02:26:23,930
Sweet Gim.

3623
02:26:24,050 --> 02:26:25,430
Alright, this is pretty fun, actually.

3624
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:30,050
This one is like Fruit Ninja, but not.

3625
02:26:36,890 --> 02:26:38,050
Oh my gosh.

3626
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:43,380
Holy moly.

3627
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:57,960
Oh my god, that was close.

3628
02:26:58,200 --> 02:26:59,140
Oh no, we're gonna die!

3629
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,080
This one's actually kinda legit.

3630
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:04,960
It's hard though, oh my gosh.

3631
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:08,960
What?

3632
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:09,760
What?

3633
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:22,570
Oh my god.

3634
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:23,570
Oh my god, oh my god.

3635
02:27:38,090 --> 02:27:38,970
Mr.Cow...Cowboy.

3636
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:58,660
Just one more.

3637
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,500
Just one more and we're good.

3638
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:03,640
Oh!

3639
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:08,900
Final boss.

3640
02:28:14,270 --> 02:28:15,230
Level five.

3641
02:28:15,610 --> 02:28:17,550
Ready, set, draw!

3642
02:28:27,690 --> 02:28:29,150
Oh, that was so close.

3643
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:42,240
I'm a pro.

3644
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:44,440
I'm a pro.

3645
02:28:44,580 --> 02:28:45,240
Oh my god.

3646
02:28:50,230 --> 02:28:50,710
No!

3647
02:28:51,490 --> 02:28:52,470
I'm not a pro.

3648
02:28:53,650 --> 02:28:54,570
Oh, wait.

3649
02:28:54,870 --> 02:28:55,350
Oh, okay.

3650
02:28:55,530 --> 02:28:55,910
That's good.

3651
02:28:56,010 --> 02:28:56,350
We're good.

3652
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:56,750
We're good.

3653
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:01,800
That one was tough.

3654
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:03,940
That one was tricky.

3655
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:07,000
You guys can do it.

3656
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:08,480
Beat the ghost for me.

3657
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,820
I actually didn't really want to beat the ghost though.

3658
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:14,880
What is Pooh?

3659
02:29:15,580 --> 02:29:15,960
Po?

3660
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:19,620
2025?

3661
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:21,300
This is recent?

3662
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:22,460
Welcome to Pooh.

3663
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,300
Pooh is your pet alien who loves to eat and play.

3664
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:27,620
Pooh is dirty.

3665
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:30,120
Go to the bathroom and clean it with soap and water.

3666
02:29:30,220 --> 02:29:30,820
Try it now.

3667
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:32,400
Use the soap bar to clean him.

3668
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:33,540
Grab the soap and begin to scrub.

3669
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:34,520
Oh.

3670
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:36,060
Oh, he's...

3671
02:29:36,060 --> 02:29:37,420
I'm grabbing it.

3672
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:38,120
I'm trying.

3673
02:29:38,380 --> 02:29:38,760
Wait.

3674
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:40,840
I'm trying to grab it.

3675
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:43,140
I'm grab...

3676
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:44,520
Oh, here?

3677
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:47,800
Nicely done.

3678
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:49,000
Now, grab the shower.

3679
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:51,080
I think I already hate this.

3680
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:53,880
This is not...

3681
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:54,960
This is an ugly...

3682
02:29:55,540 --> 02:29:56,000
Tamagotchi.

3683
02:29:57,580 --> 02:29:58,880
Let's dry him.

3684
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:01,100
I refuse to say his name even.

3685
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:04,760
And brush his teeth.

3686
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:05,740
Ooh.

3687
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:09,600
Well done.

3688
02:30:09,940 --> 02:30:11,040
Pooh is healthy again.

3689
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:12,260
Pooh seems to be hungry.

3690
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:13,080
Okay.

3691
02:30:13,220 --> 02:30:14,080
I don't want to play this anymore.

3692
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:16,660
He's 20% close to becoming an adult.

3693
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:20,660
Okay.

3694
02:30:21,850 --> 02:30:23,640
Pick up an apple and drag it.

3695
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,320
Make him less hungry.

3696
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:27,640
Try his different treats.

3697
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:29,340
Broccoli.

3698
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:31,820
Wait.

3699
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:32,940
Why does that make him crazy?

3700
02:30:35,740 --> 02:30:36,780
Dress him in some...

3701
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:39,720
He's 40% close to becoming an adult.

3702
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:41,040
Yeah.

3703
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:42,460
I kind of want to see him as an adult.

3704
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:44,700
This one's...

3705
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:45,560
Oh, let's make him very...

3706
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:45,680
Oh.

3707
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:46,340
Never mind.

3708
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:47,260
We'll make him pink.

3709
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:49,440
That looks great.

3710
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,620
Add more clothing.

3711
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:51,920
Ooh.

3712
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:53,640
Ooh.

3713
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:54,340
I can't...

3714
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:54,640
Ooga.

3715
02:30:54,820 --> 02:30:56,580
Why is Ooga locked?

3716
02:30:56,580 --> 02:30:57,680
Bieber?

3717
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:59,200
Let's do Zufi.

3718
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:01,020
And the hat.

3719
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:03,520
I can't do pirate?

3720
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:04,980
That's not an ascot.

3721
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:05,900
Oh my gosh.

3722
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:07,080
Let's do a...

3723
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:08,440
Gnome.

3724
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:13,040
Animal.

3725
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:14,420
Oh, wow.

3726
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:15,080
Look at that.

3727
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:15,660
B.

3728
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,060
Great outfit.

3729
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:18,440
Great outfit.

3730
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:19,320
Let's play some games.

3731
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:20,260
Six...

3732
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:22,780
Pooh is 60% close to becoming an adult.

3733
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:25,060
This seems so intimidating.

3734
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:26,740
We're playing games.

3735
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:30,100
Skyhop.

3736
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:33,240
Left and right arrow key.

3737
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:35,540
Oh my...

3738
02:31:52,460 --> 02:31:54,000
Try a different game.

3739
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:54,940
Wait.

3740
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:55,860
How do I replay?

3741
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:57,080
Skyhop.

3742
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:57,380
Okay.

3743
02:31:59,320 --> 02:31:59,960
Oh.

3744
02:32:00,220 --> 02:32:00,380
Oh.

3745
02:32:02,840 --> 02:32:03,480
Okay.

3746
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:04,100
One more time.

3747
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:04,740
One more time.

3748
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:06,480
I got this.

3749
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:13,680
I understand it now.

3750
02:32:26,750 --> 02:32:28,250
The music is so happy.

3751
02:32:28,490 --> 02:32:30,170
Watch me get copyright struck for this.

3752
02:32:33,110 --> 02:32:33,970
I'm a pro!

3753
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:43,360
I'm insane!

3754
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:47,320
Oh my god.

3755
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:48,420
I can't...

3756
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:49,300
I can't lose.

3757
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:51,060
To the moon!

3758
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:51,500
To the moon!

3759
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:51,900
To the moon!

3760
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:52,840
To the moon!

3761
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:54,220
Wait.

3762
02:32:54,300 --> 02:32:54,900
There's a time limit?

3763
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:10,320
I'm afraid of it.

3764
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:10,720
Not...

3765
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:13,260
It takes a second to register my clicks.

3766
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:16,000
So I can't go much faster than when I'm going.

3767
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:19,520
Oh my god!

3768
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:20,460
We're gonna die poo!

3769
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:24,540
This is it.

3770
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:27,040
Wow.

3771
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:28,600
How do I get back home?

3772
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:34,720
I'm done playing game.

3773
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:37,360
I'm done playing game.

3774
02:33:37,460 --> 02:33:38,140
How do I get back home?

3775
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:41,260
This is like a Spongebob...

3776
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:43,400
Squarepants...

3777
02:33:43,400 --> 02:33:44,680
How do I get back home?

3778
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:47,000
I'm gonna play these now.

3779
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:50,680
I'm single-handedly saving YouTube's...

3780
02:33:51,940 --> 02:33:52,860
Playable games.

3781
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:57,680
I need to do two more games?

3782
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:58,380
Is that what it said?

3783
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:00,920
Oh, you're right, you're right.

3784
02:34:00,980 --> 02:34:01,740
Let's do Hill Drive.

3785
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:02,420
Okay.

3786
02:34:06,580 --> 02:34:07,060
Why...

3787
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:08,460
Where we get this hamster from!

3788
02:34:08,980 --> 02:34:10,580
We're driving on a watermelon!

3789
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,560
Flash died for this!

3790
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:15,000
Oh!

3791
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:15,880
And so did we!

3792
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:17,260
Oh my god!

3793
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:18,260
The hamsters!

3794
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:21,360
That was so much fun!

3795
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:22,680
How about we go outside and play?

3796
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:25,440
Pooh is 80% close to becoming an adult.

3797
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:29,800
I can finally go home... and we can go outside.

3798
02:34:29,960 --> 02:34:30,540
This is outside.

3799
02:34:30,700 --> 02:34:33,500
Out here, you can water your plants and play with your pet.

3800
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,500
Why not try one?

3801
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:36,460
I'm playing with my pet.

3802
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:39,600
Oh, I'm playing with my pet.

3803
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:44,360
That's it!

3804
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:47,980
Pooh is grown up!

3805
02:34:48,140 --> 02:34:49,360
Well done, you've hit level one.

3806
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:51,540
Leveling up Pooh unlocks new items.

3807
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:54,500
Oh, too much... Mucho texto.

3808
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:55,160
Okay.

3809
02:34:56,280 --> 02:34:56,780
Wow!

3810
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:01,540
Ooh, don't do that.

3811
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:02,760
Don't do that.

3812
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:06,320
Oh, okay.

3813
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:07,060
We do this.

3814
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:08,760
Oh...

3815
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:11,620
This is... This is a game.

3816
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:18,520
You're my child!

3817
02:35:20,700 --> 02:35:23,040
I want to play aquapark.io.

3818
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:25,220
I've been seeing it on the side every time.

3819
02:35:27,240 --> 02:35:29,440
Why did he wolf whistle at me?

3820
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:34,220
Why did he do that to me?

3821
02:35:35,460 --> 02:35:37,220
That was definitely a game.

3822
02:35:43,950 --> 02:35:45,750
Oh, what is this?

3823
02:35:46,970 --> 02:35:49,130
Wait, what actually... No, what actually...

3824
02:35:49,130 --> 02:35:49,470
Play.

3825
02:35:49,850 --> 02:35:51,310
Oh, we're choosing a cup?

3826
02:35:53,370 --> 02:35:54,450
The beach cup?

3827
02:35:54,630 --> 02:35:55,130
Oh my god!

3828
02:35:55,590 --> 02:35:56,950
These are definitely real people!

3829
02:35:57,530 --> 02:35:58,750
I'm killing everyone again.

3830
02:35:58,930 --> 02:35:59,750
Oh, and myself!

3831
02:36:00,010 --> 02:36:00,650
Oh, wait!

3832
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:01,810
I'm the best ever to do it?

3833
02:36:02,030 --> 02:36:04,390
Wait, wait!

3834
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:05,830
We can catch up!

3835
02:36:06,010 --> 02:36:07,250
You guys, we can catch

3836
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:12,060
up!

3837
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:13,780
Was that not a pool?

3838
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:15,860
What did I...

3839
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:19,240
Goodbye, DuckDuck!

3840
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:21,040
Goodbye, everybody else!

3841
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:22,720
Goodbye...

3842
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:23,500
Goodbye, Jumbo!

3843
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:25,620
I'm really killing these people!

3844
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:28,820
Goodbye, ugly...

3845
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:31,140
I don't know why I called you ugly.

3846
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:31,680
I'm sorry.

3847
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:33,240
I shouldn't have done that.

3848
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:34,440
I shouldn't have done that!

3849
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:36,420
Wait, I can...

3850
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:37,400
I can do this.

3851
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:42,430
Wait, how am I only in second place?

3852
02:36:42,690 --> 02:36:43,970
Who is in first?

3853
02:36:44,990 --> 02:36:45,730
Oh my god.

3854
02:36:45,990 --> 02:36:46,750
Oh my god.

3855
02:36:46,850 --> 02:36:47,430
Oh my god.

3856
02:36:47,550 --> 02:36:47,910
Wait...

3857
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:14,710
5,000!

3858
02:37:16,930 --> 02:37:18,950
This says that it had like millions of views.

3859
02:37:19,170 --> 02:37:19,630
How am I only...

3860
02:37:19,630 --> 02:37:21,350
I must be that good of a gamer.

3861
02:37:23,050 --> 02:37:24,650
Oh no, it's fall, guys.

3862
02:37:25,390 --> 02:37:26,230
You guys see that?

3863
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:27,930
It said people out of qualif- Oh.

3864
02:37:28,270 --> 02:37:29,590
Guys, I don't think we made it.

3865
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:34,200
Guys...

3866
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:36,420
We didn't make it.

3867
02:37:38,930 --> 02:37:39,990
What else we got in here?

3868
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:44,930
It really is just a mixed bag of things.

3869
02:37:45,950 --> 02:37:47,230
It just...

3870
02:37:47,230 --> 02:37:49,370
You have Mechagallion.

3871
02:37:49,630 --> 02:37:50,390
Robot what?

3872
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:52,310
Robot fighting.

3873
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:54,010
Try Solar Smash.

3874
02:37:54,130 --> 02:37:54,930
I did that one earlier.

3875
02:37:55,930 --> 02:37:56,410
Oh.

3876
02:38:03,430 --> 02:38:04,070
Yeah!

3877
02:38:06,330 --> 02:38:07,170
I beat the game!

3878
02:38:14,170 --> 02:38:15,290
Wait, what is this?

3879
02:38:15,490 --> 02:38:16,230
Brain out.

3880
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:17,870
Okay.

3881
02:38:18,270 --> 02:38:19,690
I'm ready to brain out.

3882
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:22,950
I'm ready.

3883
02:38:22,950 --> 02:38:24,030
I'm ready.

3884
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,640
I'm ready.

3885
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:31,260
I'm ready.

3886
02:38:32,340 --> 02:38:32,960
I'm ready.

3887
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:33,540
Welcome back.

3888
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:34,840
This is my first time here.

3889
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:36,360
Find the biggest one.

3890
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:38,560
What?

3891
02:38:43,970 --> 02:38:44,590
Congratulations!

3892
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:45,390
You found it!

3893
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:47,410
How many ducks?

3894
02:38:47,990 --> 02:38:50,710
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

3895
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:52,550
No, nine.

3896
02:38:52,690 --> 02:38:53,270
That's a chicken.

3897
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:59,570
Congratulations, sweetie!

3898
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:07,060
Sweetie!

3899
02:39:10,600 --> 02:39:12,440
Who is the tallest one?

3900
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:13,020
The sun!

3901
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:20,640
Can you find the different one?

3902
02:39:24,810 --> 02:39:27,470
This music is gonna make me crash out.

3903
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:29,210
Is it this one?

3904
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:41,400
The impossible quiz or whatever?

3905
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:44,360
Which claw is similar to the cat's outstretched claw?

3906
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:48,290
This one?

3907
02:39:48,930 --> 02:39:49,450
No!

3908
02:39:50,390 --> 02:39:51,330
This one?

3909
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:52,170
No!

3910
02:39:52,530 --> 02:39:52,950
This one.

3911
02:39:53,330 --> 02:39:54,290
The cat's paw.

3912
02:39:55,290 --> 02:39:55,570
Oh.

3913
02:39:57,290 --> 02:39:57,970
I love meow!

3914
02:40:02,830 --> 02:40:05,230
Find the largest fire.

3915
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:07,110
What's the...

3916
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:08,110
What's the catch here?

3917
02:40:12,310 --> 02:40:13,870
What's the catch here?

3918
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:21,870
Oh.

3919
02:40:21,970 --> 02:40:23,370
You're supposed to make it bigger.

3920
02:40:27,790 --> 02:40:28,870
What's the number...

3921
02:40:29,350 --> 02:40:30,250
Parked on...

3922
02:40:30,250 --> 02:40:30,410
Wait.

3923
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:32,150
What's the number under the parked car?

3924
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:33,050
Nine.

3925
02:40:34,090 --> 02:40:34,670
You

3926
02:40:38,250 --> 02:40:39,330
are a genius.

3927
02:40:39,770 --> 02:40:40,770
I like the...

3928
02:40:41,890 --> 02:40:43,870
I like the, uh...

3929
02:40:43,870 --> 02:40:44,870
The sayings.

3930
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:50,280
I'm a genius.

3931
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:51,600
You are awesome!

3932
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,660
Find the chick.

3933
02:40:58,170 --> 02:40:59,890
What am I supposed to do with these?

3934
02:41:00,650 --> 02:41:02,910
There are three chicks on a...

3935
02:41:02,910 --> 02:41:03,730
There are three...

3936
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:05,290
There are three chicks in a trench coat.

3937
02:41:30,270 --> 02:41:31,060
Is it the word?

3938
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:33,100
No?

3939
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:34,820
I actually don't get this one.

3940
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:39,420
Are they Matryoshka-dolling?

3941
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:55,000
Should play Angry Birds?

3942
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:55,320
No!

3943
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:57,100
I don't think I'll play the Angry Birds one because...

3944
02:42:00,750 --> 02:42:01,450
Shake them?

3945
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:13,960
More obscure, you know.

3946
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:19,050
Count the number of hairs.

3947
02:42:21,350 --> 02:42:21,830
Three.

3948
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:25,950
I just tore all his hair out.

3949
02:42:26,050 --> 02:42:26,450
I made him...

3950
02:42:26,450 --> 02:42:26,610
Haha!

3951
02:42:26,830 --> 02:42:27,350
Not bad!

3952
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:29,030
Bad for him, maybe.

3953
02:42:29,690 --> 02:42:32,070
Help baby duckling drink water.

3954
02:42:38,210 --> 02:42:39,210
There you go.

3955
02:42:43,350 --> 02:42:45,850
It reminds me of the story of the crows drinking water.

3956
02:42:46,050 --> 02:42:47,210
Yeah, you put the rock in there, right?

3957
02:42:47,930 --> 02:42:49,530
Can you solve this question?

3958
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:05,480
What am I even supposed to click?

3959
02:43:16,170 --> 02:43:17,990
It's two, but like, what do I...

3960
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:19,050
How do I make it two?

3961
02:43:21,630 --> 02:43:22,110
Ah...

3962
02:43:22,110 --> 02:43:23,690
I was like, where do I grab it from?

3963
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:28,010
You are getting better and better...

3964
02:43:28,010 --> 02:43:28,570
This is my...

3965
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:30,530
This is like the motivation I need.

3966
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:32,690
Find something you can eat.

3967
02:43:33,390 --> 02:43:34,150
Is this ham?

3968
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:40,900
Wow, that's the way.

3969
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:42,320
I don't know what I did.

3970
02:43:42,780 --> 02:43:44,440
Cute and clever.

3971
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:47,320
The little elephant is so lonely.

3972
02:43:47,740 --> 02:43:48,180
Shake it.

3973
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:49,100
It'll make a chick.

3974
02:44:06,830 --> 02:44:07,830
I'll get this one.

3975
02:44:08,130 --> 02:44:09,050
Check behind the ear.

3976
02:44:09,670 --> 02:44:10,590
Can't click anywhere.

3977
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:21,390
Get rid of the word lonely.

3978
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:22,830
It's just a little elephant.

3979
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:24,510
What does it do?

3980
02:44:24,890 --> 02:44:26,010
Hold and drag.

3981
02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:31,250
Hold and drag?

3982
02:44:31,610 --> 02:44:31,850
Where?

3983
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:33,870
See

3984
02:44:41,860 --> 02:44:42,100
it?

3985
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:47,140
Not longly anymore.

3986
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:52,320
It's

3987
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:57,400
not longly anymore.

3988
02:45:01,150 --> 02:45:02,500
No smoking.

3989
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:03,960
What?

3990
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:07,560
It's not this one.

3991
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:09,180
Is it this one?

3992
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:09,700
What?

3993
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,440
It should be this one, no?

3994
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:13,980
No, it's smoking.

3995
02:45:20,470 --> 02:45:21,790
I'm so lonely.

3996
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:26,800
You can't move the smoke.

3997
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:30,020
Did I say click on it there?

3998
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:31,880
What if I say smoking?

3999
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:37,170
Grab the two...

4000
02:45:37,170 --> 02:45:37,870
You can't.

4001
02:45:38,410 --> 02:45:39,450
You can't.

4002
02:45:39,610 --> 02:45:41,150
You can't even grab him.

4003
02:45:41,150 --> 02:45:42,310
You can only move these.

4004
02:45:43,890 --> 02:45:47,050
You can't remove the no.

4005
02:45:49,790 --> 02:45:50,550
Hmm.

4006
02:45:51,830 --> 02:45:54,030
Put the X over the smoke.

4007
02:45:55,350 --> 02:45:55,690
No.

4008
02:45:56,290 --> 02:45:56,850
No.

4009
02:45:59,070 --> 02:45:59,890
Cover the words.

4010
02:46:04,970 --> 02:46:05,350
No.

4011
02:46:17,390 --> 02:46:18,150
Spam click.

4012
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:23,850
It kind of looks like smoke though, doesn't it?

4013
02:46:25,510 --> 02:46:25,850
What

4014
02:46:35,090 --> 02:46:36,570
is the X that appears after?

4015
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:49,340
Wipe it with the mouse.

4016
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:50,540
Wait.

4017
02:46:51,420 --> 02:46:52,440
Oh my God.

4018
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:53,700
I had to click it a bunch.

4019
02:46:53,880 --> 02:46:54,040
Great.

4020
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:55,160
No smoking now.

4021
02:46:55,460 --> 02:46:56,200
Oh my God.

4022
02:46:56,400 --> 02:46:57,380
I just...

4023
02:46:57,380 --> 02:46:58,980
Putting three coins into piggy bank.

4024
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:00,660
How many coins are there now?

4025
02:47:02,060 --> 02:47:02,320
Wait.

4026
02:47:06,580 --> 02:47:07,340
Two, three.

4027
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:07,960
Wait.

4028
02:47:08,940 --> 02:47:09,540
Wait.

4029
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:10,220
They fused.

4030
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:10,900
Oh.

4031
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:11,260
Two.

4032
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:12,080
Three.

4033
02:47:13,540 --> 02:47:13,940
Three.

4034
02:47:18,220 --> 02:47:19,120
How am I supposed...

4035
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:19,660
Oh, there we go.

4036
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:19,880
Okay.

4037
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:26,860
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

4038
02:47:26,860 --> 02:47:27,020
Let's see.

4039
02:47:30,130 --> 02:47:31,310
I killed him.

4040
02:47:31,730 --> 02:47:32,950
You did that very well.

4041
02:47:33,370 --> 02:47:34,010
So hungry.

4042
02:47:34,290 --> 02:47:35,330
Make something to eat?

4043
02:47:38,250 --> 02:47:39,550
I can make an egg.

4044
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:47,020
Tada!

4045
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:48,640
Delicious poached egg.

4046
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:53,980
What is the minimum cuts needed to cut a circle into eight equal parts?

4047
02:48:01,130 --> 02:48:01,770
Four?

4048
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:04,470
Three?

4049
02:48:05,070 --> 02:48:06,030
Is it four?

4050
02:48:07,630 --> 02:48:08,270
Three?

4051
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:14,500
No, I tried four.

4052
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:20,090
Pizza.

4053
02:48:20,830 --> 02:48:21,730
Mmm, pizza.

4054
02:48:22,050 --> 02:48:22,370
What?

4055
02:48:25,790 --> 02:48:26,810
Oh my God.

4056
02:48:27,290 --> 02:48:28,310
Have you got it?

4057
02:48:28,730 --> 02:48:30,110
Go to the exit.

4058
02:48:31,710 --> 02:48:31,910
I

4059
02:48:36,930 --> 02:48:37,630
know your games.

4060
02:48:38,310 --> 02:48:40,010
I know your games.

4061
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:42,450
It's so obvious too.

4062
02:48:46,610 --> 02:48:47,290
So...

4063
02:48:48,170 --> 02:48:49,850
I knew you could do it.

4064
02:48:51,610 --> 02:48:53,470
Find eight animals.

4065
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:54,810
One...

4066
02:48:54,810 --> 02:48:55,990
That guy's scary.

4067
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:57,230
Two...

4068
02:48:57,230 --> 02:48:58,170
Three...

4069
02:48:58,170 --> 02:48:58,710
Four...

4070
02:48:59,430 --> 02:49:00,130
Five...

4071
02:49:00,130 --> 02:49:01,630
Six...

4072
02:49:01,630 --> 02:49:02,610
Seven...

4073
02:49:03,650 --> 02:49:05,090
Where's the eighth one?

4074
02:49:06,310 --> 02:49:07,870
Do you guys see it?

4075
02:49:10,930 --> 02:49:12,070
The toes.

4076
02:49:13,870 --> 02:49:15,230
Bottom right!

4077
02:49:17,290 --> 02:49:17,990
Stop!

4078
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:19,630
I can't...

4079
02:49:19,630 --> 02:49:20,850
It won't let me lift the rock.

4080
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:24,550
I don't think I can move anything.

4081
02:49:29,070 --> 02:49:30,130
Is this animal?

4082
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:31,270
No?

4083
02:49:33,450 --> 02:49:34,530
It's not the word.

4084
02:49:34,770 --> 02:49:35,910
It's not behind the cloud.

4085
02:49:37,290 --> 02:49:38,230
Shake the tree.

4086
02:49:38,450 --> 02:49:39,550
Maybe if I click it a lot.

4087
02:49:40,050 --> 02:49:41,030
Something will happen.

4088
02:49:43,050 --> 02:50:15,640
Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake

4089
02:50:15,640 --> 02:50:20,740
Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Shake Drive the car to the road sign... What?

4090
02:50:21,900 --> 02:50:22,700
Huh?

4091
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:30,960
What?

4092
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:32,960
What?

4093
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:37,840
What?

4094
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:41,720
Oh, the clouds too!

4095
02:50:43,420 --> 02:50:44,820
There we go!

4096
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:52,730
I thought it was a ramp.

4097
02:50:53,370 --> 02:50:54,670
How to eat carrots?

4098
02:51:00,610 --> 02:51:02,290
Thank you so much!

4099
02:51:03,890 --> 02:51:04,010
What?

4100
02:51:04,350 --> 02:51:06,110
Three numbers add up to twelve.

4101
02:51:07,710 --> 02:51:11,130
Oh... What's

4102
02:51:20,570 --> 02:51:20,890
happening?

4103
02:51:25,810 --> 02:51:27,250
Oh, three numbers!

4104
02:51:27,430 --> 02:51:28,470
I thought it was two numbers.

4105
02:51:37,230 --> 02:51:38,210
Use the two.

4106
02:51:39,250 --> 02:51:39,990
What two?

4107
02:51:40,270 --> 02:51:40,750
This one?

4108
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:51,640
How do I use the two, though?

4109
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:53,640
Three, five, six.

4110
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:55,180
I'm not good at math, you guys.

4111
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:56,300
Oh, wait!

4112
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:00,400
Oh, oh, wait.

4113
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:01,440
I don't think it's that, though.

4114
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:01,840
Wait.

4115
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:06,060
That doesn't add up to... Wait.

4116
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:06,840
Wait.

4117
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:07,840
Wait.

4118
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:08,060
What?

4119
02:52:11,870 --> 02:52:12,550
Three... Six?

4120
02:52:14,250 --> 02:52:14,730
Three?

4121
02:52:15,590 --> 02:52:16,510
Small three.

4122
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:16,890
Okay.

4123
02:52:18,930 --> 02:52:21,030
You just solved a hard math problem.

4124
02:52:21,670 --> 02:52:24,090
Actually, my chat did, because I don't know how to do math.

4125
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:28,120
Into the box.

4126
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:29,400
Into the box.

4127
02:52:29,660 --> 02:52:30,680
Into the box.

4128
02:52:30,940 --> 02:52:31,820
Into the box.

4129
02:52:34,020 --> 02:52:35,020
Into the box.

4130
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:40,000
A magical box could hold everything.

4131
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:40,500
Hup!

4132
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:40,940
Oh.

4133
02:52:41,240 --> 02:52:41,500
Hup!

4134
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:46,140
Am I doing it?

4135
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:49,920
Am I doing it?

4136
02:52:50,220 --> 02:52:51,280
Am I whacking the mole?

4137
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:51,840
Oh.

4138
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:54,900
Have you played whack-a-mole before?

4139
02:52:55,400 --> 02:52:57,640
It seems like they're insulting me.

4140
02:52:58,400 --> 02:52:59,580
Find the object.

4141
02:53:02,500 --> 02:53:02,960
This.

4142
02:53:03,620 --> 02:53:04,080
This.

4143
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:05,200
Okay.

4144
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:06,960
I think I'm almost done with this one, you guys.

4145
02:53:08,220 --> 02:53:08,680
There.

4146
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:12,200
The music is driving me a little... You know what?

4147
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:14,160
I think I'm done.

4148
02:53:14,620 --> 02:53:15,520
I think I'm done.

4149
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:16,360
I think I'm done.

4150
02:53:16,660 --> 02:53:17,040
Let's go.

4151
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:17,480
Let's leave.

4152
02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:20,460
I think I'm done.

4153
02:53:20,700 --> 02:53:21,180
I think I'm good.

4154
02:53:21,580 --> 02:53:21,720
Okay.

4155
02:53:21,780 --> 02:53:22,460
Let's do...

4156
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:26,160
Let's do...

4157
02:53:31,690 --> 02:53:32,550
Let's do...

4158
02:53:32,550 --> 02:53:33,770
Let's try...

4159
02:53:35,250 --> 02:53:35,730
Yeah.

4160
02:53:35,750 --> 02:53:37,030
I was going crazy from the music.

4161
02:53:37,230 --> 02:53:40,030
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

4162
02:53:40,130 --> 02:53:42,250
I can't believe these are all actually playable.

4163
02:53:42,790 --> 02:53:44,750
That's, like, the biggest thing for me.

4164
02:53:45,030 --> 02:53:47,170
We gotta do the flappy foot, Jinko.

4165
02:53:48,910 --> 02:53:50,190
We gotta do it.

4166
02:53:51,810 --> 02:53:53,970
Flappy foot, Jinko.

4167
02:53:56,110 --> 02:53:56,950
Hey, you.

4168
02:53:57,270 --> 02:53:57,970
This is...

4169
02:53:58,830 --> 02:53:59,430
Moe...

4170
02:54:01,310 --> 02:54:01,910
Joe...

4171
02:54:01,910 --> 02:54:02,670
Joe...

4172
02:54:02,670 --> 02:54:03,550
Joe-cito.

4173
02:54:05,070 --> 02:54:08,490
I shall be your coach to win the most relevant football competitions.

4174
02:54:08,750 --> 02:54:09,750
Do as I say.

4175
02:54:10,730 --> 02:54:12,370
See that little guy down there?

4176
02:54:12,530 --> 02:54:14,230
Just click to make him kick the ball.

4177
02:54:14,650 --> 02:54:14,730
Oh.

4178
02:54:15,370 --> 02:54:17,570
Now click again to make the ball bounce.

4179
02:54:18,610 --> 02:54:18,930
Oh.

4180
02:54:25,370 --> 02:54:26,390
I'll get it.

4181
02:54:27,950 --> 02:54:28,190
I'll get it.

4182
02:54:28,190 --> 02:54:29,210
Do I hold it?

4183
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:30,090
No.

4184
02:54:31,190 --> 02:54:32,690
Do I drag it?

4185
02:54:35,010 --> 02:54:35,690
What?

4186
02:54:36,050 --> 02:54:37,410
I can't move it.

4187
02:54:37,510 --> 02:54:37,910
Can I?

4188
02:54:37,910 --> 02:54:38,910
No?

4189
02:54:39,710 --> 02:54:39,870
No?

4190
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:48,610
Click the number.

4191
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:53,840
Click the ball.

4192
02:54:54,220 --> 02:54:55,160
Oh, spam click?

4193
02:54:56,260 --> 02:54:56,940
Oh!

4194
02:54:58,120 --> 02:54:58,880
Because it's...

4195
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:00,260
Flappy ball.

4196
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:16,460
You are ready to move on and play Oceana Cup.

4197
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:16,840
Okay.

4198
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:19,640
Go New Zealand!

4199
02:55:34,340 --> 02:55:35,400
Wait, why did I game over?

4200
02:55:35,460 --> 02:55:36,460
I looked away for two seconds.

4201
02:55:50,340 --> 02:55:52,700
Oh, oopsie.

4202
02:55:56,620 --> 02:55:58,400
Oh, he's tickling my...

4203
02:56:00,620 --> 02:56:01,360
Go!

4204
02:56:05,540 --> 02:56:08,420
I was looking at your super chest.

4205
02:56:27,950 --> 02:56:29,490
Oh, shoot.

4206
02:56:31,110 --> 02:56:31,770
Go!

4207
02:56:33,170 --> 02:56:33,830
Okay.

4208
02:56:34,790 --> 02:56:35,190
I

4209
02:56:42,790 --> 02:56:46,130
don't wanna... I don't wanna... It's too... You know, it's like a pretty easy, like...

4210
02:56:46,130 --> 02:56:47,770
To say... Oh, he...

4211
02:56:48,410 --> 02:56:49,430
He grabbed my...

4212
02:56:56,660 --> 02:56:58,240
The music's kinda awesome, though.

4213
02:56:58,420 --> 02:56:58,960
Oh, shoot.

4214
02:56:59,200 --> 02:56:59,600
Oh, shoot.

4215
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:04,680
I'm the... I'm good with Flappy...

4216
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:06,620
Flappy ball.

4217
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:09,840
How... Oh, there's Cut the Rope!

4218
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:12,480
This is what you were talking about.

4219
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:13,540
Wait a second.

4220
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:14,620
This guy looks familiar, though.

4221
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:15,740
Find the alien.

4222
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:16,680
Wait...

4223
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:17,600
Okay.

4224
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:20,640
Cut the Rope!

4225
02:57:20,700 --> 02:57:21,800
Is that not like a...

4226
02:57:21,800 --> 02:57:22,500
An actual...

4227
02:57:22,500 --> 02:57:23,000
Game game?

4228
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:24,440
Like a mobile game or whatever?

4229
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:30,180
Classic mobile game.

4230
02:57:30,540 --> 02:57:31,300
I wanna try find...

4231
02:57:31,300 --> 02:57:32,320
I'm trying to find the one...

4232
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:34,380
I wanna play the ones that are like a little weird, you know?

4233
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:44,660
Find the aliens.

4234
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:47,140
Okay, that's a human.

4235
02:57:47,880 --> 02:57:49,360
That's a frickin' alien!

4236
02:57:50,920 --> 02:57:51,600
Kill him!

4237
02:58:13,270 --> 02:58:15,590
He just wants to dance!

4238
02:58:16,450 --> 02:58:18,750
He just wants to have a good time!

4239
02:58:19,050 --> 02:58:20,370
Does this... How does this get harder?

4240
02:58:20,630 --> 02:58:21,830
That's my question.

4241
02:58:22,950 --> 02:58:23,730
Okay, level three.

4242
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:25,210
I'm finding the aliens.

4243
02:58:25,870 --> 02:58:27,890
They're arguing in the bathroom!

4244
02:58:28,390 --> 02:58:29,590
With an alien!

4245
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:31,750
Oh my gosh.

4246
02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:33,510
Skelly and alien should kiss.

4247
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:38,500
What are the aliens...

4248
02:58:38,500 --> 02:58:42,580
Well, the aliens are doing wrong because he was arguing with her, but...

4249
02:58:42,580 --> 02:58:43,630
Meow, meow, meow.

4250
02:58:46,370 --> 02:58:46,720
Oh!

4251
02:58:47,400 --> 02:58:47,800
Whoa!

4252
02:58:49,320 --> 02:58:50,020
What?

4253
02:58:52,130 --> 02:58:52,650
Um...

4254
02:58:52,650 --> 02:58:55,970
Can't a man just be alone with his two alien girlfriends?

4255
02:58:58,350 --> 02:59:00,270
Can't a man just...

4256
02:59:01,370 --> 02:59:03,510
Can't a man just be...

4257
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:07,030
Be existing with his two alien girlfriends?

4258
02:59:09,050 --> 02:59:11,470
Who am I to...

4259
02:59:11,470 --> 02:59:12,470
To...

4260
02:59:12,470 --> 02:59:13,470
To deny that?

4261
02:59:14,310 --> 02:59:14,770
Oh!

4262
02:59:15,030 --> 02:59:15,770
Oh my god.

4263
02:59:15,790 --> 02:59:16,810
I'm about to kill a cop.

4264
02:59:24,470 --> 02:59:25,450
It's the kid.

4265
02:59:26,110 --> 02:59:26,170
No?

4266
02:59:26,470 --> 02:59:27,510
It's the guy in the suit.

4267
02:59:31,630 --> 02:59:33,110
Why are they angry at me?

4268
02:59:33,230 --> 02:59:34,130
Because I'm killing aliens?

4269
02:59:35,410 --> 02:59:37,190
They hate me because I...

4270
02:59:37,190 --> 02:59:37,750
Oh, wow!

4271
02:59:37,870 --> 02:59:38,990
It's the king alien!

4272
02:59:39,650 --> 02:59:41,210
He comes in peace.

4273
02:59:52,010 --> 02:59:53,150
Pitiful human!

4274
02:59:54,230 --> 02:59:56,410
You cannot stop the invasion!

4275
02:59:57,070 --> 02:59:58,210
I'll be back.

4276
03:00:01,170 --> 03:00:02,670
He's behind the tree.

4277
03:00:03,650 --> 03:00:04,450
No!

4278
03:00:09,260 --> 03:00:09,980
Okay, this kinda...

4279
03:00:09,980 --> 03:00:10,980
Wait, what's happening here?

4280
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:14,160
Oh!

4281
03:00:14,740 --> 03:00:15,120
What?

4282
03:00:15,620 --> 03:00:16,040
No!

4283
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:17,880
No!

4284
03:00:19,180 --> 03:00:19,980
No!

4285
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:22,620
That's a mass murder!

4286
03:00:28,260 --> 03:00:29,600
Citizens rescued!

4287
03:00:30,460 --> 03:00:31,180
One...

4288
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:34,000
Two...

4289
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:35,240
Oh yeah, raise the roof!

4290
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:36,080
Three...

4291
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:36,980
Yeah, raise the roof!

4292
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:38,200
Four...

4293
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:38,840
Raise the roof!

4294
03:00:39,560 --> 03:00:40,200
Roof!

4295
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:40,860
Roof!

4296
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:41,740
Roof!

4297
03:00:42,060 --> 03:00:42,380
Roof!

4298
03:00:42,380 --> 03:00:42,820
Woo!

4299
03:00:43,100 --> 03:00:43,600
Yeah!

4300
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:44,200
Woo!

4301
03:00:44,580 --> 03:00:44,900
Woo!

4302
03:00:45,460 --> 03:00:45,640
Woo!

4303
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:48,840
Why did I capture them?

4304
03:00:49,360 --> 03:00:49,680
Yeah!

4305
03:00:49,880 --> 03:00:49,980
Yeah!

4306
03:00:50,140 --> 03:00:50,300
Yeah!

4307
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:50,620
Yeah!

4308
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:52,440
Wait, I thought I killed you earlier.

4309
03:00:53,560 --> 03:00:55,040
The home has been liber...

4310
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:56,220
80...

4311
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:57,360
86?

4312
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:04,500
Holy cow!

4313
03:01:04,500 --> 03:01:04,660
Wow!

4314
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:08,480
This game has...

4315
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:09,800
Incredible...

4316
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:10,740
Play value!

4317
03:01:13,640 --> 03:01:14,340
Incredible!

4318
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:14,960
Incredible!

4319
03:01:16,190 --> 03:01:17,500
Guys, what should we end on?

4320
03:01:18,240 --> 03:01:18,840
What?

4321
03:01:18,980 --> 03:01:19,260
What?

4322
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:19,880
What?

4323
03:01:20,020 --> 03:01:20,520
What?

4324
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:20,980
What?

4325
03:01:21,420 --> 03:01:23,100
Should we end on?

4326
03:01:23,360 --> 03:01:24,340
Something really silly.

4327
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:26,320
Something really crazy.

4328
03:01:29,300 --> 03:01:31,540
Not forking sausage again.

4329
03:01:33,780 --> 03:01:35,220
The family one?

4330
03:01:35,620 --> 03:01:36,820
You're speaking my language.

4331
03:01:39,780 --> 03:01:41,520
You're speaking my language.

4332
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:43,400
Oh, where was it?

4333
03:01:44,300 --> 03:01:45,140
Oh, family life.

4334
03:01:45,280 --> 03:01:45,640
I found it.

4335
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:46,560
Let's go!

4336
03:01:50,770 --> 03:01:51,370
Alright.

4337
03:01:52,430 --> 03:01:53,950
Oh, it has my save!

4338
03:01:54,650 --> 03:01:56,950
Well, we just started this lady, so...

4339
03:01:56,950 --> 03:01:58,110
The Perez family.

4340
03:01:58,450 --> 03:02:01,630
We're not gonna go with some bum Tobias this time.

4341
03:02:02,250 --> 03:02:02,790
We're gonna...

4342
03:02:03,950 --> 03:02:06,210
Brianna wants to buy the lottery ticket.

4343
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:08,490
It's only 10 bucks.

4344
03:02:14,440 --> 03:02:20,000
Brianna won a first prize of 1.09 million dollars!

4345
03:02:27,710 --> 03:02:29,730
You're welcome, Brianna.

4346
03:02:31,970 --> 03:02:35,850
Brianna feels uneasy about frequent business trips required by her job.

4347
03:02:36,910 --> 03:02:37,530
Resign!

4348
03:02:37,710 --> 03:02:39,910
Girl, we just won the lottery!

4349
03:02:40,710 --> 03:02:42,190
Be fully prepared.

4350
03:02:42,330 --> 03:02:42,430
No.

4351
03:02:42,750 --> 03:02:43,530
Don't quit your job.

4352
03:02:44,910 --> 03:02:45,970
Minky is...

4353
03:02:45,970 --> 03:02:48,370
It's time to transition into playing Roblox.

4354
03:02:48,370 --> 03:02:48,970
No!

4355
03:02:49,190 --> 03:02:50,210
You can't convince me.

4356
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:51,450
Why did you just send me money?

4357
03:02:54,090 --> 03:02:54,650
Bari...

4358
03:02:58,960 --> 03:03:01,900
Bari, hop on YouTube Playables.

4359
03:03:02,400 --> 03:03:04,180
Bari, hop on YouTube Playables.

4360
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:06,040
Phoebe!

4361
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:07,960
Thank you for the bread!

4362
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:10,620
We're playing YouTube Playable games today.

4363
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:14,860
Canaan, stop laughing during your playthrough of that alien game.

4364
03:03:16,620 --> 03:03:18,100
I'm glad you liked it.

4365
03:03:18,100 --> 03:03:19,020
Bari, thank you!

4366
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:21,020
Burpee, thanks for the gift and thank you guys!

4367
03:03:21,680 --> 03:03:22,160
Thank you, thank you.

4368
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:24,600
Brianna is contemplating how to approach her work.

4369
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:26,820
Work normally, girl.

4370
03:03:26,920 --> 03:03:27,760
You won the lottery.

4371
03:03:29,700 --> 03:03:30,620
You won the lottery.

4372
03:03:30,820 --> 03:03:32,280
Mike, thanks for one month!

4373
03:03:32,880 --> 03:03:34,180
Ducky, thank you so much for the gift and...

4374
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:35,560
Bari, thank you for the final gift and...

4375
03:03:35,900 --> 03:03:36,620
Who is this?

4376
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:40,020
Brianna knocked Shannon's water over at the gym.

4377
03:03:41,780 --> 03:03:43,560
How much does Shannon make?

4378
03:03:44,600 --> 03:03:45,180
Seven...

4379
03:03:45,180 --> 03:03:45,960
No, no, no.

4380
03:03:46,080 --> 03:03:46,800
Blame Shannon.

4381
03:03:48,300 --> 03:03:50,140
Shannon felt offended and left.

4382
03:03:50,660 --> 03:03:51,580
Brianna, you can do better.

4383
03:03:56,240 --> 03:03:58,540
We're not getting no bum this time.

4384
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:01,220
Brianna and Bradford met at...

4385
03:04:01,220 --> 03:04:02,240
Not the basketball.

4386
03:04:07,530 --> 03:04:08,130
Equals!

4387
03:04:09,070 --> 03:04:10,190
Chat about favorites.

4388
03:04:10,550 --> 03:04:10,750
Stop...

4389
03:04:10,750 --> 03:04:11,130
Wait, no.

4390
03:04:11,250 --> 03:04:13,130
Play basketball together and then you'll get married.

4391
03:04:14,150 --> 03:04:14,830
Oh my god!

4392
03:04:14,950 --> 03:04:15,430
Happened!

4393
03:04:20,310 --> 03:04:20,910
Um...

4394
03:04:20,910 --> 03:04:21,910
Livestream the wedding!

4395
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:26,430
Wahoo!

4396
03:04:27,710 --> 03:04:28,270
Kitties!

4397
03:04:28,630 --> 03:04:29,850
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

4398
03:04:30,210 --> 03:04:31,910
Brianna feels uncertain about her career.

4399
03:04:32,810 --> 03:04:33,890
Develop your own skills.

4400
03:04:35,390 --> 03:04:35,990
Oh yeah.

4401
03:04:39,690 --> 03:04:40,890
We're gonna have...

4402
03:04:40,890 --> 03:04:42,450
Okay, let's aim for 10 kids.

4403
03:04:42,590 --> 03:04:43,190
Have a baby.

4404
03:04:44,610 --> 03:04:45,870
The best doctor.

4405
03:04:46,170 --> 03:04:47,630
We're a millionaire, literally.

4406
03:04:48,010 --> 03:04:49,310
Wait, we got pets!

4407
03:04:51,770 --> 03:04:53,090
This is our baby.

4408
03:04:53,690 --> 03:04:55,170
Name the baby...

4409
03:04:55,590 --> 03:04:56,930
New names.

4410
03:04:58,710 --> 03:04:59,830
New names.

4411
03:05:00,730 --> 03:05:01,850
New names.

4412
03:05:02,410 --> 03:05:03,870
What if we don't get a Woody?

4413
03:05:04,870 --> 03:05:06,930
Would you like to play basketball with me?

4414
03:05:08,570 --> 03:05:10,430
I've played basketball before.

4415
03:05:11,410 --> 03:05:13,410
They benched me every time.

4416
03:05:15,070 --> 03:05:16,530
10 kids in this economy?

4417
03:05:16,770 --> 03:05:17,130
We're...

4418
03:05:17,490 --> 03:05:18,410
We're a millionaire!

4419
03:05:20,630 --> 03:05:21,870
Go with Aaron.

4420
03:05:22,550 --> 03:05:23,870
Okay, we'll go with Aaron.

4421
03:05:25,110 --> 03:05:25,990
Wait, what?

4422
03:05:26,310 --> 03:05:27,150
Wait, what do you mean?

4423
03:05:27,150 --> 03:05:28,210
The baby...

4424
03:05:32,120 --> 03:05:34,080
Wait, why does it say Alexa?

4425
03:05:38,620 --> 03:05:39,820
Unattractive Aaron.

4426
03:05:40,780 --> 03:05:41,860
It's a baby!

4427
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:45,960
Wait, we have a...

4428
03:05:45,960 --> 03:05:47,840
We can unlock pets, apparently.

4429
03:05:50,340 --> 03:05:51,240
No, we can't.

4430
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:52,100
We can't afford it.

4431
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:54,020
I can only find 10k on the road.

4432
03:05:55,820 --> 03:05:57,740
Unlock after the birth of third child.

4433
03:05:57,900 --> 03:05:59,180
Okay, we gotta get the three babies.

4434
03:05:59,560 --> 03:06:00,340
Have a baby!

4435
03:06:01,420 --> 03:06:02,260
Best doctor.

4436
03:06:02,420 --> 03:06:03,960
Don't search for it online this time.

4437
03:06:04,440 --> 03:06:05,580
Wait, we can spend...

4438
03:06:05,580 --> 03:06:06,220
It's a chance.

4439
03:06:06,780 --> 03:06:07,220
100%.

4440
03:06:07,220 --> 03:06:08,060
Acquaintance doctor.

4441
03:06:08,060 --> 03:06:09,780
We won't lose the baby.

4442
03:06:10,020 --> 03:06:10,560
Yeah!

4443
03:06:12,220 --> 03:06:14,980
Unlock city map can purchase properties.

4444
03:06:16,960 --> 03:06:17,560
Whoa!

4445
03:06:17,900 --> 03:06:19,480
This is the city where your family resides.

4446
03:06:19,840 --> 03:06:21,220
This is your family's residence.

4447
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:23,680
Okay.

4448
03:06:24,680 --> 03:06:27,360
You can assign family members to the residence.

4449
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:32,380
Note that family members who are not assigned to a residence will have decreased happiness values.

4450
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,980
Overcrowding housing will lead to a decrease...

4451
03:06:34,980 --> 03:06:35,080
Okay.

4452
03:06:37,620 --> 03:06:38,400
There you go.

4453
03:06:38,660 --> 03:06:39,160
Well done.

4454
03:06:39,380 --> 03:06:39,500
Okay.

4455
03:06:39,780 --> 03:06:40,560
Purchase more.

4456
03:06:41,260 --> 03:06:43,960
Buy commercial buildings to expand your family business.

4457
03:06:44,300 --> 03:06:45,140
Enjoy your game!

4458
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:47,800
Uh...

4459
03:06:47,800 --> 03:06:49,240
What else we got in here?

4460
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:52,760
I can buy the whole city.

4461
03:06:56,160 --> 03:06:57,620
Where were you living last time?

4462
03:06:57,640 --> 03:06:59,060
I think just in this house before.

4463
03:07:00,820 --> 03:07:03,500
Let's buy this little modest place right here.

4464
03:07:03,820 --> 03:07:05,260
A small diner.

4465
03:07:07,180 --> 03:07:08,220
Buy it.

4466
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:10,500
Oh, I have to have people here.

4467
03:07:11,400 --> 03:07:11,680
Okay.

4468
03:07:11,820 --> 03:07:13,460
Bradford, you have been...

4469
03:07:14,060 --> 03:07:15,500
You have been reassigned.

4470
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:17,280
Okay.

4471
03:07:18,360 --> 03:07:19,740
Emma's dad Bradford...

4472
03:07:19,740 --> 03:07:20,280
Oh...

4473
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:21,840
Wanna give a more unique name.

4474
03:07:23,300 --> 03:07:24,160
Oh dear Lucy!

4475
03:07:26,700 --> 03:07:27,420
What...

4476
03:07:27,420 --> 03:07:27,640
Okay.

4477
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:29,080
So we have unattractive Aaron...

4478
03:07:29,080 --> 03:07:30,100
And...

4479
03:07:30,100 --> 03:07:30,780
Happy Lucy.

4480
03:07:31,040 --> 03:07:31,260
Okay.

4481
03:07:31,260 --> 03:07:32,620
We know who the favorite is.

4482
03:07:32,980 --> 03:07:33,720
What about Brianna?

4483
03:07:33,820 --> 03:07:34,560
Brianna's happy.

4484
03:07:38,380 --> 03:07:39,460
Unattractive Bradford.

4485
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:48,120
Unattractive Bradford says...

4486
03:07:48,120 --> 03:07:49,200
He wants to open a liquid...

4487
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:49,840
A lick...

4488
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:50,380
Lick...

4489
03:07:50,980 --> 03:07:51,580
Liquid...

4490
03:07:55,540 --> 03:07:56,860
A liquor store.

4491
03:08:06,020 --> 03:08:06,620
Let's...

4492
03:08:06,620 --> 03:08:07,100
Okay.

4493
03:08:07,160 --> 03:08:08,620
Let's do the 36k.

4494
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:09,460
It's a...

4495
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:10,780
Almost 50% chance.

4496
03:08:10,900 --> 03:08:12,040
There's no way we'll fail this.

4497
03:08:13,580 --> 03:08:15,200
No customers show up.

4498
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:15,860
Damn it.

4499
03:08:20,670 --> 03:08:22,070
Invest in stocks!

4500
03:08:22,450 --> 03:08:23,030
Okay.

4501
03:08:23,250 --> 03:08:24,370
49% chance.

4502
03:08:24,590 --> 03:08:25,810
There's no way we'll fail this.

4503
03:08:27,190 --> 03:08:28,630
The investment failed.

4504
03:08:37,930 --> 03:08:40,670
Lucy likes to bite her own toes.

4505
03:08:52,300 --> 03:08:53,680
Moe from the Simpsons.

4506
03:08:53,960 --> 03:08:54,080
Yeah.

4507
03:08:55,160 --> 03:08:57,580
I think we gotta put chili on Lucy's toes.

4508
03:08:59,020 --> 03:09:00,340
Chill out little Lucy.

4509
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:02,980
Lucy no longer bit her own toes.

4510
03:09:16,940 --> 03:09:19,380
No customer showed up to a liquor store.

4511
03:09:19,520 --> 03:09:20,180
I know, right?

4512
03:09:21,720 --> 03:09:22,620
It's pretty...

4513
03:09:22,620 --> 03:09:23,480
It's a dry city.

4514
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:28,040
Lucy is unwilling to share her toys with other children, resulting in few friends.

4515
03:09:28,140 --> 03:09:29,060
Lucy is a baby.

4516
03:09:29,660 --> 03:09:30,740
Lucy has no friends.

4517
03:09:31,820 --> 03:09:32,940
Don't share toys.

4518
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:33,540
Share toys.

4519
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:34,880
Snatch toys for mothers.

4520
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:36,240
Play alone.

4521
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:37,700
Lone Wolf Lucy.

4522
03:09:38,380 --> 03:09:40,020
Lucy feels very lonely.

4523
03:09:41,800 --> 03:09:42,880
Childish Lucy.

4524
03:09:44,020 --> 03:09:45,240
Unattractive parents.

4525
03:09:45,680 --> 03:09:46,160
So sad.

4526
03:09:46,380 --> 03:09:46,620
Wait!

4527
03:09:47,380 --> 03:09:50,300
I think we can buy some more things, right?

4528
03:09:50,300 --> 03:09:51,480
What the?

4529
03:09:52,660 --> 03:09:54,220
Brianna is tough work competition.

4530
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:56,280
And worries about losing the job.

4531
03:09:58,160 --> 03:10:00,000
Look for opportunities for promotion.

4532
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:02,340
Okay.

4533
03:10:03,160 --> 03:10:04,000
Alright, let's see.

4534
03:10:04,300 --> 03:10:07,320
Conduct comprehensive training to increase Lucy's smart.

4535
03:10:07,440 --> 03:10:08,880
Why is it all just Lucy?

4536
03:10:09,960 --> 03:10:10,680
Let...

4537
03:10:10,680 --> 03:10:11,040
Let...

4538
03:10:11,460 --> 03:10:14,940
Let unattractive Bradford increase the charm through surgery!

4539
03:10:15,560 --> 03:10:16,080
This...

4540
03:10:16,080 --> 03:10:17,760
This game is insane!

4541
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:21,760
Wait, does he have a stat of zero?

4542
03:10:22,380 --> 03:10:24,160
Is he zero unattractive?

4543
03:10:25,020 --> 03:10:26,220
Oh my god!

4544
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:28,700
He's that...

4545
03:10:28,700 --> 03:10:30,140
That's why he's unattractive.

4546
03:10:30,400 --> 03:10:32,520
He has no riz or anything!

4547
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:33,920
Okay, we gotta do it.

4548
03:10:33,960 --> 03:10:34,880
We gotta do the surgery.

4549
03:10:35,500 --> 03:10:38,360
Bradford walked into a world-famous plastic surgery...

4550
03:10:38,360 --> 03:10:38,820
Clinic.

4551
03:10:40,460 --> 03:10:41,820
He's now intelligent!

4552
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:48,720
Gonna need a long play of this game.

4553
03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:50,900
No!

4554
03:10:53,660 --> 03:10:54,420
This is...

4555
03:10:54,420 --> 03:10:55,540
This is how it works.

4556
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:00,920
The damn good...

4557
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:01,100
Yeah.

4558
03:11:01,300 --> 03:11:01,780
Oh my gosh!

4559
03:11:01,880 --> 03:11:04,720
Wait, he's making so much more money now because he's handsome!

4560
03:11:06,680 --> 03:11:09,980
Brianna has been assigned to work in an unfamiliar city and feels uncomfortable.

4561
03:11:11,380 --> 03:11:12,720
Maybe I'll like it here.

4562
03:11:13,860 --> 03:11:15,020
Oh, she likes it.

4563
03:11:15,220 --> 03:11:15,340
Okay.

4564
03:11:15,700 --> 03:11:15,980
Good.

4565
03:11:18,360 --> 03:11:20,780
Remarried him for the money and then forced him to get surgery.

4566
03:11:22,500 --> 03:11:22,980
Look.

4567
03:11:23,420 --> 03:11:24,460
He's making so much...

4568
03:11:24,460 --> 03:11:25,200
He's happy now!

4569
03:11:26,640 --> 03:11:27,600
He's intelligent!

4570
03:11:29,560 --> 03:11:32,700
Has a conflict with colleagues due to differences in opinions?

4571
03:11:34,660 --> 03:11:36,080
I can stand that.

4572
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:39,280
She is physically and mentally affected.

4573
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:41,260
Are you still happy?

4574
03:11:41,840 --> 03:11:42,960
Happy Brianna.

4575
03:11:43,140 --> 03:11:43,780
Yeah, you're fine.

4576
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:44,480
You're fine.

4577
03:11:45,780 --> 03:11:47,120
Let's have another baby.

4578
03:11:51,880 --> 03:11:53,240
Brianna wants to buy a lottery.

4579
03:11:53,240 --> 03:11:56,520
How lucky could we be to win twice?

4580
03:11:58,100 --> 03:11:58,620
But

4581
03:12:09,400 --> 03:12:10,720
like crazy, right?

4582
03:12:11,780 --> 03:12:14,880
Our family business, small diner, suddenly lost power.

4583
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:18,620
Use a lot of candles.

4584
03:12:19,560 --> 03:12:21,220
Yeah, it's like a...

4585
03:12:21,220 --> 03:12:23,720
Oh, we use a lot of candles for lighting but business was slow.

4586
03:12:24,080 --> 03:12:26,640
Oh, I feel like that would be really appealing though, no?

4587
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:26,700
Oh!

4588
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:29,860
Like I would go...

4589
03:12:29,860 --> 03:12:34,840
Have you seen those like ads for like orchestras that are all...

4590
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:35,940
that have a bunch of...

4591
03:12:35,940 --> 03:12:37,460
like orchestras by...

4592
03:12:37,460 --> 03:12:38,940
by candlelight?

4593
03:12:40,060 --> 03:12:41,020
See you later!

4594
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:44,460
Romantic candlelit dinner night!

4595
03:12:44,560 --> 03:12:45,540
That's what I'm saying!

4596
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:49,840
It wasn't the liquor store, it was our diner.

4597
03:12:50,040 --> 03:12:51,940
Lucy accidentally broke her parents.

4598
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:53,800
Do we have a second child?

4599
03:12:53,800 --> 03:12:56,520
No, our ugly Erin baby is not doing anything.

4600
03:12:56,740 --> 03:12:57,520
I think she's broken.

4601
03:12:59,200 --> 03:13:01,120
Reduce Lucy's pocket money!

4602
03:13:01,420 --> 03:13:02,720
She's a baby!

4603
03:13:07,590 --> 03:13:10,610
What pocket money are we giving to our baby?

4604
03:13:11,350 --> 03:13:12,370
She's not even...

4605
03:13:16,210 --> 03:13:18,430
Throw away Lucy's toys.

4606
03:13:18,710 --> 03:13:19,810
We're the worst parents ever.

4607
03:13:20,550 --> 03:13:22,010
Gently educate Lucy.

4608
03:13:22,570 --> 03:13:24,890
No, Lucy you're taking your pocket money, take it away.

4609
03:13:24,890 --> 03:13:27,510
Lucy realized her mistake.

4610
03:13:27,990 --> 03:13:30,210
Lucy is like...

4611
03:13:30,890 --> 03:13:32,550
Lucy is five years old.

4612
03:13:37,470 --> 03:13:39,690
Happy Lucy has reached...

4613
03:13:39,690 --> 03:13:40,930
Elementary school!

4614
03:13:41,270 --> 03:13:43,690
Okay, everybody is going to elite private school.

4615
03:13:46,250 --> 03:13:48,410
Unattractive is still unattractive.

4616
03:13:51,370 --> 03:13:53,810
Unattractive Erin goes to the public school.

4617
03:13:59,560 --> 03:14:01,280
Bradford reports a poisoning...

4618
03:14:02,780 --> 03:14:03,180
What?

4619
03:14:04,060 --> 03:14:09,160
A poisoning incident in the cafeteria of her family business small diner.

4620
03:14:09,700 --> 03:14:11,240
Carry out a thorough investigation.

4621
03:14:11,540 --> 03:14:13,060
Punish Bradford!

4622
03:14:13,060 --> 03:14:14,340
What did he do?

4623
03:14:20,720 --> 03:14:21,800
We must...

4624
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:22,880
Punished Bradford.

4625
03:14:24,720 --> 03:14:28,020
Bradford accepts the punishment and promises that such incidents will never...

4626
03:14:28,020 --> 03:14:29,140
What do you mean poisoning?

4627
03:14:29,780 --> 03:14:31,360
How did that make him ha...

4628
03:14:31,360 --> 03:14:32,600
It upped his...

4629
03:14:32,600 --> 03:14:33,800
His charm?

4630
03:14:34,580 --> 03:14:36,360
He's a music major.

4631
03:14:36,360 --> 03:14:36,880
Wow.

4632
03:14:37,660 --> 03:14:38,900
Oh, so is she.

4633
03:14:39,080 --> 03:14:40,080
Ivy League University.

4634
03:14:40,940 --> 03:14:41,500
Holy cow.

4635
03:14:45,840 --> 03:14:47,920
Brianna wants to invest in stocks.

4636
03:14:49,560 --> 03:14:50,900
Invest big, baby.

4637
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:54,160
It paid off!

4638
03:14:57,320 --> 03:14:58,460
Bradford is an M.

4639
03:14:58,560 --> 03:14:59,300
I think so too.

4640
03:15:02,760 --> 03:15:04,720
Brianna is anxious about her project.

4641
03:15:06,180 --> 03:15:07,140
Work overtime.

4642
03:15:09,220 --> 03:15:12,020
You can be sad for now, but you'll get money later.

4643
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:18,960
Erin often feels drowsy during class.

4644
03:15:20,980 --> 03:15:22,000
Work out more!

4645
03:15:24,060 --> 03:15:25,220
Okay, come on, girl.

4646
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:27,420
Your charm is 9.

4647
03:15:27,940 --> 03:15:28,380
What is...

4648
03:15:28,380 --> 03:15:29,200
What is Lucy?

4649
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:30,160
95!

4650
03:15:32,940 --> 03:15:33,740
Oh my god.

4651
03:15:33,960 --> 03:15:35,620
There's actual favorites here.

4652
03:15:38,040 --> 03:15:39,140
I think...

4653
03:15:39,140 --> 03:15:41,000
Erin needs to go to the doctor.

4654
03:15:41,140 --> 03:15:42,400
Why is she so sleepy?

4655
03:15:44,800 --> 03:15:45,440
Drink...

4656
03:15:45,440 --> 03:15:48,880
Erin has trouble sleeping at night and often suffers from insomnia.

4657
03:15:49,840 --> 03:15:52,100
Watch some Taktok before bed.

4658
03:15:52,220 --> 03:15:52,580
Yeah, yeah.

4659
03:15:53,560 --> 03:15:56,060
Erin has a harder time falling asleep.

4660
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:08,140
Bradford seems to be suffering from that.

4661
03:16:14,300 --> 03:16:16,080
Bradford, where did you get that from?

4662
03:16:22,050 --> 03:16:22,690
Brad...

4663
03:16:24,030 --> 03:16:25,310
From where?!

4664
03:16:28,070 --> 03:16:31,090
I swear this game just like...

4665
03:16:32,030 --> 03:16:34,150
Has like a wheel of...

4666
03:16:34,150 --> 03:16:34,610
Of...

4667
03:16:35,290 --> 03:16:36,450
Illnesses you can get.

4668
03:16:36,450 --> 03:16:37,430
And just...

4669
03:16:38,270 --> 03:16:39,630
Like a database.

4670
03:16:39,990 --> 03:16:40,850
And just...

4671
03:16:40,850 --> 03:16:42,250
Fix any of them.

4672
03:16:51,490 --> 03:16:52,950
We gotta wait for...

4673
03:16:52,950 --> 03:16:54,970
We gotta just wish for a miracle Bradford.

4674
03:16:56,570 --> 03:16:58,270
Feels the condition is worse.

4675
03:16:58,430 --> 03:17:00,090
I don't think that ever...

4676
03:17:00,970 --> 03:17:02,470
Yields a positive result.

4677
03:17:03,750 --> 03:17:04,670
Yells at her.

4678
03:17:07,230 --> 03:17:11,290
I'm convinced that some of these options are always the same thing, you know?

4679
03:17:13,330 --> 03:17:16,390
Bradford found a hungry and injured dog near the flower beds!

4680
03:17:16,550 --> 03:17:17,010
Take it home.

4681
03:17:18,310 --> 03:17:19,410
We have a pet!

4682
03:17:21,690 --> 03:17:26,450
Wait, Bradford happily brought the pet home and spent $136 on treating its illness.

4683
03:17:26,450 --> 03:17:29,650
But it says plus $136, so...

4684
03:17:29,650 --> 03:17:31,290
Did we lose it?

4685
03:17:32,230 --> 03:17:33,750
No, we gained the money.

4686
03:17:40,920 --> 03:17:42,480
We... got the money.

4687
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:44,160
Stonks.

4688
03:17:44,900 --> 03:17:47,820
Aaron finds her health education homework too difficult.

4689
03:17:48,340 --> 03:17:49,960
Giving up can be sweet.

4690
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:51,980
Explore the wiki online!

4691
03:17:53,180 --> 03:17:56,080
Aaron has improved her learning ability and hands-on skill.

4692
03:17:56,500 --> 03:17:58,300
Aaron, are you still unattractive?

4693
03:17:58,360 --> 03:17:59,020
Yes, you are.

4694
03:17:59,020 --> 03:18:00,400
It's okay, we'll get you there, girl.

4695
03:18:00,660 --> 03:18:01,300
Oh, look at that.

4696
03:18:02,020 --> 03:18:04,440
Aaron is thinking about the transportation to school today.

4697
03:18:06,700 --> 03:18:08,260
Take a taxi, rich girl.

4698
03:18:09,400 --> 03:18:10,520
Spent a lot of money.

4699
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:15,780
There is a hepatitis you can get from restaurants when people don't wash their hands while making the food.

4700
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:17,680
It's why buffets close a lot.

4701
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:21,480
What the?

4702
03:18:22,740 --> 03:18:23,620
That's horrible!

4703
03:18:24,020 --> 03:18:24,620
Money, money!

4704
03:18:27,060 --> 03:18:29,180
What the hell happened to Bradford?

4705
03:18:32,180 --> 03:18:34,100
He grew his hair out.

4706
03:18:35,460 --> 03:18:37,600
I'm not a fan.

4707
03:18:38,340 --> 03:18:40,540
I'm not... I'm not a fan.

4708
03:18:41,300 --> 03:18:46,280
Our family business small diner was extorted by a group of thieves!

4709
03:18:46,280 --> 03:18:49,240
Try to reason with the gangsters.

4710
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:51,360
It's a 100% chance.

4711
03:18:52,380 --> 03:18:56,620
The conflict is solved and their boss promised not to bother us again.

4712
03:18:58,620 --> 03:19:01,500
He threatened them by giving them hepatitis.

4713
03:19:03,060 --> 03:19:04,520
He says, you don't want this money.

4714
03:19:06,280 --> 03:19:08,060
It's literal dirty money!

4715
03:19:10,420 --> 03:19:11,480
Aaron is...

4716
03:19:11,480 --> 03:19:12,300
Aaron is...

4717
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:13,780
Aaron always gets poor grades in mathematics.

4718
03:19:14,820 --> 03:19:15,540
Study with a friend.

4719
03:19:16,460 --> 03:19:16,880
Yay!

4720
03:19:17,060 --> 03:19:17,900
She improved her grades.

4721
03:19:19,220 --> 03:19:21,680
The mob fears punish Bradford.

4722
03:19:21,820 --> 03:19:23,000
This guy has changed.

4723
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:25,620
Rihanna and Bradford feel like having another child.

4724
03:19:25,920 --> 03:19:26,580
Have a baby.

4725
03:19:30,560 --> 03:19:31,160
Yes!

4726
03:19:33,020 --> 03:19:34,600
Oh my god, another girl.

4727
03:19:35,940 --> 03:19:37,200
Unattractive, get a cute dog.

4728
03:19:37,400 --> 03:19:37,620
True.

4729
03:19:39,060 --> 03:19:40,220
Hi, I mean, don't hope you're doing well.

4730
03:19:40,320 --> 03:19:40,960
You too, Brandon.

4731
03:19:42,100 --> 03:19:42,820
Let's see.

4732
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:44,740
Think of new names.

4733
03:19:45,460 --> 03:19:45,860
Paisley.

4734
03:19:48,940 --> 03:19:49,900
Mabel is cute.

4735
03:19:50,220 --> 03:19:51,440
We'll name the baby Mabel.

4736
03:19:51,620 --> 03:19:52,780
New baby Mabel.

4737
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:53,480
Is that him?

4738
03:19:55,940 --> 03:19:57,060
Reached middle school.

4739
03:19:58,220 --> 03:20:01,160
Oh my gosh, $30,000.

4740
03:20:04,580 --> 03:20:05,400
I guess?

4741
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:05,840
Okay.

4742
03:20:06,860 --> 03:20:12,340
Erin will also go to the elite private middle school because she just has so many issues with her grades.

4743
03:20:12,540 --> 03:20:13,940
It also might make her attractive.

4744
03:20:14,160 --> 03:20:14,560
Never mind.

4745
03:20:14,900 --> 03:20:15,560
Okay, never mind.

4746
03:20:18,060 --> 03:20:24,060
Erin was secretly watching inappropriate content online.

4747
03:20:29,840 --> 03:20:31,680
Girl, you just got into middle school.

4748
03:20:32,060 --> 03:20:34,000
Criticize and tell Erin not to do it again.

4749
03:20:34,340 --> 03:20:38,040
Spend $489 to buy Erin the horror movies.

4750
03:20:38,560 --> 03:20:40,040
What does that mean?

4751
03:20:43,460 --> 03:20:45,680
What are the horror movies?

4752
03:20:47,560 --> 03:20:48,500
Erin, girl.

4753
03:20:50,040 --> 03:20:51,440
She's a little freak.

4754
03:20:55,990 --> 03:20:57,270
By the horror movies.

4755
03:20:57,270 --> 03:20:57,410
By the horror movies.

4756
03:20:58,150 --> 03:21:03,030
Erin lost interest in them and began to consider environmental issues on her.

4757
03:21:19,810 --> 03:21:23,950
I guess the horror movies was like March of the Penguins.

4758
03:21:38,320 --> 03:21:39,900
All gooned out.

4759
03:21:41,660 --> 03:21:43,820
What else is she supposed to do?

4760
03:21:43,960 --> 03:21:45,060
She's unattractive.

4761
03:21:45,060 --> 03:21:47,060
Nobody else wants her, I guess.

4762
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:49,740
Erin out here watching snot.

4763
03:21:50,580 --> 03:21:51,500
Snot's a lot.

4764
03:21:56,350 --> 03:21:58,530
Bradford's pet doesn't want to eat and has been throwing up.

4765
03:21:58,610 --> 03:21:59,330
He might be sick.

4766
03:21:59,570 --> 03:22:00,930
Find a veterinarian right now.

4767
03:22:01,170 --> 03:22:02,370
The pet is just tired.

4768
03:22:02,750 --> 03:22:02,790
No.

4769
03:22:04,870 --> 03:22:06,090
Timely treatment and recovered.

4770
03:22:06,610 --> 03:22:09,130
We're not gonna mess around with the pets.

4771
03:22:11,490 --> 03:22:12,390
How are we...

4772
03:22:12,390 --> 03:22:14,250
Wait, we were at 420 per second.

4773
03:22:14,250 --> 03:22:15,170
Now we lost mine.

4774
03:22:16,010 --> 03:22:18,290
Lucy is anxious about her upcoming school competition.

4775
03:22:18,470 --> 03:22:18,930
Practice more.

4776
03:22:19,710 --> 03:22:20,510
She did it.

4777
03:22:21,030 --> 03:22:23,050
But it went down to 386 per second.

4778
03:22:24,330 --> 03:22:25,690
Guys, it's 2034!

4779
03:22:26,030 --> 03:22:27,810
We've made it further than before!

4780
03:22:29,350 --> 03:22:32,750
Priyana is unhappy with the company's policies and wants to change!

4781
03:22:34,030 --> 03:22:38,330
Okay, it's a 68% chance of the company's current problems if we point them out.

4782
03:22:40,710 --> 03:22:42,290
If we do that...

4783
03:22:42,290 --> 03:22:44,730
And we fail, we might get fired.

4784
03:22:44,730 --> 03:22:47,210
And then we can't afford this lifestyle anymore.

4785
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:57,780
That's upon hearing that someone is becoming a firemental activist.

4786
03:22:58,760 --> 03:22:59,420
Take the risk.

4787
03:23:02,800 --> 03:23:03,960
Priyana was fired.

4788
03:23:05,740 --> 03:23:06,920
Look for a new job!

4789
03:23:07,060 --> 03:23:07,180
Okay.

4790
03:23:09,620 --> 03:23:11,320
Wait, I think this pays better.

4791
03:23:11,660 --> 03:23:12,880
Wait, this pays better!

4792
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:14,160
Sales director?

4793
03:23:15,320 --> 03:23:21,100
Aaron watches Burdumeck's trailer for one second and decides she's fed up with that crap.

4794
03:23:22,860 --> 03:23:23,200
Wait!

4795
03:23:23,540 --> 03:23:24,940
We're making more money now!

4796
03:23:29,920 --> 03:23:30,940
Bradford thinks...

4797
03:23:30,940 --> 03:23:33,680
We can promote our family business diner through live streaming!

4798
03:23:35,020 --> 03:23:36,460
Ignore his idea.

4799
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:38,520
Um...

4800
03:23:38,520 --> 03:23:40,760
Let Bradford live stream to promote our business.

4801
03:23:40,760 --> 03:23:44,080
Oh gosh, Bradford wants to become a TikTok streamer.

4802
03:23:44,520 --> 03:23:46,500
Why do they always go to streamer?

4803
03:23:50,120 --> 03:23:52,000
I think Bradford's on to something.

4804
03:23:53,440 --> 03:23:55,040
He became happy once.

4805
03:23:55,600 --> 03:23:56,740
Now wants to stream?

4806
03:24:02,120 --> 03:24:03,020
Go Pro?

4807
03:24:04,620 --> 03:24:06,020
Thanks for the hilarious stream!

4808
03:24:06,540 --> 03:24:07,620
Wish you a speedy 400k!

4809
03:24:07,760 --> 03:24:08,240
I'm excited for you!

4810
03:24:08,340 --> 03:24:09,020
Thank you, Levin!

4811
03:24:09,480 --> 03:24:10,040
Thank you!

4812
03:24:11,320 --> 03:24:12,260
Alright, let's try it.

4813
03:24:12,540 --> 03:24:13,060
31% chance.

4814
03:24:13,200 --> 03:24:13,380
Go!

4815
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:16,780
Bradford's live streaming receives no attention.

4816
03:24:18,620 --> 03:24:19,580
Poor Bradford.

4817
03:24:19,840 --> 03:24:21,400
He's gotta learn the hard way, you know.

4818
03:24:22,960 --> 03:24:26,320
Brianna finds small animals adorable and wants to adopt a dog.

4819
03:24:26,320 --> 03:24:27,240
The second dog?

4820
03:24:27,620 --> 03:24:28,940
Adopt from pet rescue.

4821
03:24:30,160 --> 03:24:31,160
Always adopt.

4822
03:24:31,500 --> 03:24:32,020
Everybody.

4823
03:24:32,760 --> 03:24:34,160
Adopt, adopt, adopt.

4824
03:24:36,200 --> 03:24:37,420
Adopt, adopt, adopt.

4825
03:24:37,780 --> 03:24:41,000
Oh my god, I saw the cutest cat at the pet store the other day.

4826
03:24:41,360 --> 03:24:42,980
Oh my gosh!

4827
03:24:42,980 --> 03:24:43,880
It was like...

4828
03:24:43,880 --> 03:24:45,560
It was the prettiest cat.

4829
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:47,020
Like, it was completely white.

4830
03:24:47,380 --> 03:24:49,060
I've never seen such a...

4831
03:24:49,060 --> 03:24:49,820
It was just...

4832
03:24:49,820 --> 03:24:50,800
So cute!

4833
03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:52,060
Very cute!

4834
03:24:52,720 --> 03:24:54,720
Very paper mintio coated.

4835
03:24:59,050 --> 03:25:00,830
Have been looking to adopt recently?

4836
03:25:01,070 --> 03:25:01,510
Yeah!

4837
03:25:02,070 --> 03:25:03,090
You should, you should.

4838
03:25:04,510 --> 03:25:06,810
Lucy has reached the age to attend high school.

4839
03:25:07,510 --> 03:25:08,370
Holy moly!

4840
03:25:08,790 --> 03:25:11,890
$56,000 for elite private high...

4841
03:25:11,890 --> 03:25:15,030
Okay, we're gonna have the smartest, most attractive children ever.

4842
03:25:24,760 --> 03:25:25,880
Why does...

4843
03:25:26,660 --> 03:25:27,600
Intelligent Aaron!

4844
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:29,900
Why does Aaron cost us so much more money?

4845
03:25:32,360 --> 03:25:35,480
So I need to suspect Bradford might be mint- Why me?

4846
03:25:36,560 --> 03:25:38,320
This is why I don't go into pet stores.

4847
03:25:38,600 --> 03:25:40,000
I had six at one point.

4848
03:25:41,780 --> 03:25:43,540
I think Aaron is dying.

4849
03:25:44,760 --> 03:25:45,700
Adjust sleep routine.

4850
03:25:46,420 --> 03:25:46,840
Oh!

4851
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:47,500
It worked!

4852
03:25:52,830 --> 03:25:56,850
A rich man wants to invest in our family business small diner.

4853
03:25:56,950 --> 03:25:59,610
But he wants Bradford to come clean his house for him.

4854
03:26:00,690 --> 03:26:01,170
What?

4855
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:05,150
Ask if Bradford's partner can do this for the family.

4856
03:26:05,550 --> 03:26:07,550
Ask if Bradford can do this for the family.

4857
03:26:07,630 --> 03:26:08,690
Who's Bradford's partner?

4858
03:26:09,750 --> 03:26:11,630
Too bad his name wasn't Chadford!

4859
03:26:12,690 --> 03:26:13,090
Sus.

4860
03:26:13,730 --> 03:26:15,090
This is kinda sus, right?

4861
03:26:15,770 --> 03:26:17,090
We could say no way.

4862
03:26:18,030 --> 03:26:20,990
Tell the rich man that he will need to pay separately for the cleanup.

4863
03:26:21,170 --> 03:26:21,450
Actually!

4864
03:26:23,230 --> 03:26:23,630
Yeah.

4865
03:26:24,750 --> 03:26:27,810
Bradford has a fight with the rich man who warns us to watch out.

4866
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:30,070
Why?

4867
03:26:31,910 --> 03:26:32,790
What?

4868
03:26:36,360 --> 03:26:37,300
I'm confused.

4869
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:43,200
Mabel has reached elementary school!

4870
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:45,940
To the elite school you go.

4871
03:26:47,820 --> 03:26:48,700
Oh yeah.

4872
03:26:49,320 --> 03:26:50,780
Our family of geniuses.

4873
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:52,320
Does everybody wear glasses?

4874
03:26:52,640 --> 03:26:54,000
What the hell?

4875
03:26:54,420 --> 03:26:56,240
We're a family of nerds.

4876
03:26:58,520 --> 03:27:00,900
Brianna has been assigned to work...

4877
03:27:00,900 --> 03:27:01,180
Oh yeah.

4878
03:27:01,320 --> 03:27:02,260
Maybe I'll lag it here.

4879
03:27:03,940 --> 03:27:05,180
That worked before.

4880
03:27:08,940 --> 03:27:10,740
Family of nerds.

4881
03:27:11,820 --> 03:27:14,100
Brianna plans to invest in a new company.

4882
03:27:16,580 --> 03:27:17,860
Invest 33k!

4883
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:19,780
It was success!

4884
03:27:19,980 --> 03:27:21,000
Brianna's lucky.

4885
03:27:21,360 --> 03:27:22,760
She's a lucky owl.

4886
03:27:22,920 --> 03:27:23,480
Oh my gosh.

4887
03:27:25,940 --> 03:27:27,600
Brianna wants to go on a trip.

4888
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:32,700
Guys...

4889
03:27:33,740 --> 03:27:35,120
It's 2037.

4890
03:27:35,680 --> 03:27:37,860
We've already made it?

4891
03:27:38,820 --> 03:27:42,220
A couple years past what we made before?

4892
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:45,700
I think it's time to fly to the moon, baby.

4893
03:27:46,340 --> 03:27:48,080
50% chance...

4894
03:27:48,820 --> 03:27:49,840
To the moon!

4895
03:27:49,840 --> 03:27:50,100
Food!

4896
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:56,460
Brianna found the footprint of Armstrong on the moon.

4897
03:27:57,880 --> 03:27:58,980
Oh, we're broke.

4898
03:27:59,520 --> 03:28:01,040
Well, no, we're not broke, but you know.

4899
03:28:04,140 --> 03:28:05,280
Difficulty with homework.

4900
03:28:05,940 --> 03:28:07,000
Ask the teachers, yeah.

4901
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:08,480
We made it!

4902
03:28:11,640 --> 03:28:12,960
What if we didn't live?

4903
03:28:13,200 --> 03:28:16,020
Brianna's angry because her boss has an unreasonable task.

4904
03:28:17,800 --> 03:28:18,800
Request extension.

4905
03:28:19,460 --> 03:28:20,700
Oh, it worked!

4906
03:28:21,280 --> 03:28:21,940
Let's go.

4907
03:28:24,460 --> 03:28:25,880
Brianna is so charming.

4908
03:28:26,420 --> 03:28:27,560
Brianna got fired!

4909
03:28:31,420 --> 03:28:33,020
Because of attendance issues.

4910
03:28:33,180 --> 03:28:34,300
Girl, what are you doing?

4911
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:45,020
Look for a new job.

4912
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:46,580
Wait!

4913
03:28:46,980 --> 03:28:48,020
This is more money!

4914
03:28:48,220 --> 03:28:49,100
She's gonna be a singer.

4915
03:28:49,320 --> 03:28:50,140
My girl Brianna.

4916
03:28:50,540 --> 03:28:52,720
Wait, didn't she go to school for music?

4917
03:28:53,160 --> 03:28:53,700
Yeah!

4918
03:28:53,980 --> 03:28:54,920
Now she's a singer?

4919
03:28:55,300 --> 03:28:57,120
And we're making even more money?

4920
03:29:00,220 --> 03:29:00,920
Bradford's pet.

4921
03:29:01,280 --> 03:29:03,160
What was wrong with your doll?

4922
03:29:03,340 --> 03:29:05,000
Well, he did like get it from the street.

4923
03:29:05,220 --> 03:29:05,320
Yeah.

4924
03:29:06,140 --> 03:29:07,020
Could be...

4925
03:29:07,880 --> 03:29:09,000
Full of, you know.

4926
03:29:09,100 --> 03:29:10,380
Could have a lot of diseases.

4927
03:29:10,980 --> 03:29:12,020
And illnesses.

4928
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:13,480
Sicknesses.

4929
03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:14,480
You know.

4930
03:29:16,100 --> 03:29:19,440
Mabel was invited by classmates to attend a weekend party.

4931
03:29:20,060 --> 03:29:22,520
Dress up as a clown and attend the party.

4932
03:29:22,700 --> 03:29:23,520
Go Mabel, go!

4933
03:29:24,560 --> 03:29:28,740
Mabel dressed up as a clown to attend the party and was very popular.

4934
03:29:33,740 --> 03:29:34,800
Oh my gosh.

4935
03:29:34,940 --> 03:29:35,800
It's time for university.

4936
03:29:36,020 --> 03:29:36,880
Intelligent Erin!

4937
03:29:38,100 --> 03:29:38,920
Ivy League.

4938
03:29:39,160 --> 03:29:40,000
She's intelligent.

4939
03:29:41,620 --> 03:29:42,380
Uh...

4940
03:29:42,380 --> 03:29:43,260
Choose...

4941
03:29:43,260 --> 03:29:44,320
Business.

4942
03:29:44,740 --> 03:29:44,900
Wait.

4943
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:45,140
No.

4944
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:45,600
Refresh.

4945
03:29:46,960 --> 03:29:47,720
Biology.

4946
03:29:48,080 --> 03:29:48,700
Psycho...

4947
03:29:48,700 --> 03:29:48,960
No.

4948
03:29:49,040 --> 03:29:50,360
We're a family of musicians.

4949
03:29:51,620 --> 03:29:52,380
Nevermind.

4950
03:29:52,540 --> 03:29:52,960
Choose...

4951
03:29:52,960 --> 03:29:53,080
You know.

4952
03:29:53,420 --> 03:29:54,160
Business.

4953
03:29:56,900 --> 03:29:58,740
Hope to develop well in the future.

4954
03:29:58,740 --> 03:29:58,760
Hope to develop well in the future.

4955
03:30:00,020 --> 03:30:01,100
Charming Lucy.

4956
03:30:04,260 --> 03:30:04,800
Lucy!

4957
03:30:05,380 --> 03:30:07,520
Can go to Public Ivy.

4958
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:10,180
Or State University.

4959
03:30:10,380 --> 03:30:11,040
Go to State University.

4960
03:30:11,720 --> 03:30:12,290
You're gonna do...

4961
03:30:15,920 --> 03:30:16,460
Psychology.

4962
03:30:17,360 --> 03:30:17,620
Char...

4963
03:30:17,620 --> 03:30:19,660
Lucy just seems like a psychology type, you know.

4964
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:23,000
You're burning through your money.

4965
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:23,560
No, we're not.

4966
03:30:23,840 --> 03:30:24,340
We're fine.

4967
03:30:25,720 --> 03:30:27,580
Mabel is addicted to playing video games.

4968
03:30:27,740 --> 03:30:28,320
That's so true.

4969
03:30:28,660 --> 03:30:31,920
Spend $327 to buy Mabel the latest game.

4970
03:30:33,940 --> 03:30:37,020
This is how much video games will cost in 2040.

4971
03:30:37,420 --> 03:30:38,940
Oh my god!

4972
03:30:42,820 --> 03:30:45,800
Mabel loved gaming and wanted to make games in the future.

4973
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:46,340
Aw!

4974
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:48,000
Our little Kojima.

4975
03:30:48,900 --> 03:30:50,200
She's so sweet!

4976
03:30:52,740 --> 03:30:55,680
She's gonna grow up and make cozy gaming games.

4977
03:30:56,040 --> 03:30:56,960
Cozy slop.

4978
03:30:57,800 --> 03:31:00,380
Mabel is thinking about the transportation to school.

4979
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:02,100
You know, just walk.

4980
03:31:03,860 --> 03:31:05,920
Mabel chose to walk and was late.

4981
03:31:07,260 --> 03:31:11,940
What this game has taught me is that winning the lotto can make your family do great even if they are unattractive.

4982
03:31:11,940 --> 03:31:14,340
Yeah, he got surgery because we were so rich.

4983
03:31:16,960 --> 03:31:19,140
She's gonna grow up to make family life.

4984
03:31:19,140 --> 03:31:23,060
Classmates think Mabel is stealing and want to frisk her?

4985
03:31:23,340 --> 03:31:24,640
Frisk her?

4986
03:31:24,880 --> 03:31:25,960
What does that mean?

4987
03:31:28,790 --> 03:31:30,480
What does frisk her mean?

4988
03:31:32,220 --> 03:31:34,180
She's in elementary school!

4989
03:31:35,910 --> 03:31:37,640
They want to pat her down?

4990
03:31:39,930 --> 03:31:42,020
Warned classmate of privacy violation.

4991
03:31:42,890 --> 03:31:45,920
Classmates gave up frisking Mabel but warned Mabel.

4992
03:31:47,520 --> 03:31:49,740
Mabel just wants to make video games.

4993
03:31:49,860 --> 03:31:50,500
Leave her alone.

4994
03:31:52,900 --> 03:31:55,920
Aaron has been arguing with parents over trivial matters.

4995
03:31:58,540 --> 03:32:00,580
Open your heart and talk.

4996
03:32:02,020 --> 03:32:02,760
Oh, it improved.

4997
03:32:03,840 --> 03:32:04,600
Are you still...

4998
03:32:04,600 --> 03:32:05,680
Oh, now she's happy!

4999
03:32:08,280 --> 03:32:08,800
Mabel...

5000
03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:09,880
Oh, it's middle school time.

5001
03:32:11,040 --> 03:32:12,440
I don't think you're smart enough.

5002
03:32:12,480 --> 03:32:13,480
We're losing money.

5003
03:32:13,480 --> 03:32:14,940
You just go to a private middle school.

5004
03:32:15,160 --> 03:32:15,500
You're fine.

5005
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:18,720
Time to say goodbye.

5006
03:32:22,080 --> 03:32:25,320
Lucy rescued Daniel during an adventure?

5007
03:32:26,480 --> 03:32:28,600
Share adventure experience.

5008
03:32:28,800 --> 03:32:30,200
Offer comfort and support.

5009
03:32:30,860 --> 03:32:31,000
Wait.

5010
03:32:32,560 --> 03:32:35,480
Daniel actually makes money, so...

5011
03:32:36,320 --> 03:32:37,400
Offer comfort...

5012
03:32:37,400 --> 03:32:38,640
Damn, Lucy!

5013
03:32:40,020 --> 03:32:43,320
Yeah, what kind of adventure are we talking about?

5014
03:32:44,060 --> 03:32:45,600
Offer comfort and support.

5015
03:32:45,800 --> 03:32:46,420
They're gonna have a kid.

5016
03:32:50,340 --> 03:32:52,220
Have a free livestream wedding.

5017
03:32:54,680 --> 03:32:56,260
Wow, they're already married.

5018
03:32:57,720 --> 03:32:59,900
When is Lucy gonna start pulling her weight?

5019
03:32:59,900 --> 03:33:00,560
Why?

5020
03:33:00,560 --> 03:33:02,040
Why is she still a negative expense?

5021
03:33:02,300 --> 03:33:02,740
Oh!

5022
03:33:03,280 --> 03:33:04,840
I thought it said Bradford died.

5023
03:33:07,700 --> 03:33:10,700
Bradford's pet passed away due to old age.

5024
03:33:11,240 --> 03:33:11,540
No!

5025
03:33:15,710 --> 03:33:17,230
Aaron and Wes...

5026
03:33:17,230 --> 03:33:19,650
Wesley looks exactly like her father.

5027
03:33:24,120 --> 03:33:24,800
Give...

5028
03:33:24,800 --> 03:33:26,720
Aaron and Wesley met each other.

5029
03:33:26,840 --> 03:33:27,200
That's it.

5030
03:33:27,460 --> 03:33:28,600
Give Wesley a flower.

5031
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:29,760
Date Wesley.

5032
03:33:30,140 --> 03:33:31,040
Insult Wesley.

5033
03:33:32,820 --> 03:33:33,420
Wesley.

5034
03:33:33,540 --> 03:33:35,460
Wesley also makes money, so...

5035
03:33:35,460 --> 03:33:37,420
We're gonna give Wesley a flower.

5036
03:33:38,300 --> 03:33:38,900
And...

5037
03:33:41,780 --> 03:33:43,200
It's so easy, you guys.

5038
03:33:43,460 --> 03:33:46,500
Why haven't you already fallen in love and gotten married?

5039
03:33:46,800 --> 03:33:49,240
All you have to do is give flowers and play basketball.

5040
03:33:50,120 --> 03:33:51,160
It's so easy.

5041
03:33:52,900 --> 03:33:54,920
It's so stinking easy.

5042
03:33:55,500 --> 03:33:57,460
And then you have a livestreamed wedding.

5043
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:00,200
Why haven't you?

5044
03:34:02,560 --> 03:34:04,400
I haven't...

5045
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:06,300
Played basketball or...

5046
03:34:06,900 --> 03:34:07,800
Received any flowers.

5047
03:34:07,800 --> 03:34:08,620
That's why.

5048
03:34:12,960 --> 03:34:15,040
I'm not good at basketball.

5049
03:34:16,840 --> 03:34:17,440
Make me.

5050
03:34:17,660 --> 03:34:19,220
Thanks for the...

5051
03:34:19,220 --> 03:34:20,420
Digital flower.

5052
03:34:21,900 --> 03:34:23,120
A kiss.

5053
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:23,600
Thanks for that.

5054
03:34:23,600 --> 03:34:24,080
Oh...

5055
03:34:24,080 --> 03:34:24,840
I should...

5056
03:34:27,320 --> 03:34:28,720
But what about the basketball?

5057
03:34:29,120 --> 03:34:29,810
Oh, and also...

5058
03:34:30,160 --> 03:34:31,680
I have to rescue you from an adventure.

5059
03:34:32,380 --> 03:34:33,800
We can't forget that part too.

5060
03:34:36,320 --> 03:34:37,180
Have a baby.

5061
03:34:37,580 --> 03:34:38,520
Lucy, you need a job.

5062
03:34:40,420 --> 03:34:40,880
Lucy?

5063
03:34:43,340 --> 03:34:44,580
Barry the baby!

5064
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:45,580
Wait...

5065
03:34:45,580 --> 03:34:47,060
No, I wanna keep Barry, please.

5066
03:34:47,400 --> 03:34:49,480
Please, can I keep Barry the baby?

5067
03:34:49,480 --> 03:34:51,700
We can have Archie the baby.

5068
03:34:52,180 --> 03:34:53,420
We can have Archie the baby.

5069
03:34:54,200 --> 03:34:54,840
Steve...

5070
03:34:55,200 --> 03:34:55,520
Tommy...

5071
03:34:56,380 --> 03:34:57,020
Steven...

5072
03:34:57,020 --> 03:34:57,920
Thank you.

5073
03:34:58,940 --> 03:35:00,460
Oh my god, Spirity!

5074
03:35:01,200 --> 03:35:02,340
I have some flowers.

5075
03:35:02,420 --> 03:35:03,840
Will you play basketball with me?

5076
03:35:04,060 --> 03:35:06,880
You literally told us to play basketball growing up.

5077
03:35:07,020 --> 03:35:08,800
Where did you screw up?

5078
03:35:09,530 --> 03:35:10,700
Asking for reference.

5079
03:35:11,200 --> 03:35:11,940
Rajiko...

5080
03:35:11,940 --> 03:35:12,240
Thank you.

5081
03:35:12,800 --> 03:35:13,340
Aniki!

5082
03:35:17,540 --> 03:35:18,280
Vernon...

5083
03:35:18,280 --> 03:35:18,840
Oh my gosh.

5084
03:35:19,880 --> 03:35:20,840
Vernon Snake.

5085
03:35:25,650 --> 03:35:26,020
Boss...

5086
03:35:26,020 --> 03:35:27,140
Why you hurt me like that?

5087
03:35:27,460 --> 03:35:30,020
36 and maiden list still JK, by the way.

5088
03:35:31,020 --> 03:35:31,760
Salken...

5089
03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:33,700
Salken, you literally have a girlfriend!

5090
03:35:34,760 --> 03:35:35,500
Salken!

5091
03:35:37,720 --> 03:35:38,460
Salken!

5092
03:35:39,580 --> 03:35:40,160
There!

5093
03:35:44,470 --> 03:35:45,530
Neo, thank you.

5094
03:35:45,710 --> 03:35:46,490
Panic, thank you!

5095
03:35:46,990 --> 03:35:49,490
In a room lit by candles full of flowers.

5096
03:35:49,750 --> 03:35:50,790
That sounds like a...

5097
03:35:50,790 --> 03:35:51,710
Fire hazard.

5098
03:35:52,250 --> 03:35:53,090
Teacup, thank you!

5099
03:35:54,340 --> 03:35:55,810
Fox, thank you.

5100
03:35:57,510 --> 03:35:58,090
Alright.

5101
03:35:58,350 --> 03:35:59,870
Lucy, you really need a job, girl.

5102
03:36:01,130 --> 03:36:03,510
Aaron has graduated from university!

5103
03:36:04,410 --> 03:36:06,650
Wait, adjust the mindset and get ready for...

5104
03:36:06,650 --> 03:36:06,970
To work.

5105
03:36:07,190 --> 03:36:07,610
Yeah, girl.

5106
03:36:09,050 --> 03:36:11,030
It's time to work, baby!

5107
03:36:11,310 --> 03:36:12,710
You stole her from me!

5108
03:36:13,610 --> 03:36:14,630
Virgil, thank you!

5109
03:36:15,030 --> 03:36:15,430
Peter!

5110
03:36:15,650 --> 03:36:15,970
Oh my gosh!

5111
03:36:16,070 --> 03:36:16,630
Thank you!

5112
03:36:18,710 --> 03:36:21,430
Oh my gosh, you're being showered with...

5113
03:36:21,430 --> 03:36:22,770
With flowers!

5114
03:36:23,330 --> 03:36:23,970
It's like...

5115
03:36:23,970 --> 03:36:26,230
It's like I'm closing out a performance.

5116
03:36:26,730 --> 03:36:27,210
Lucy!

5117
03:36:29,370 --> 03:36:30,590
A modeling job.

5118
03:36:30,770 --> 03:36:31,990
She is charming, Lucy.

5119
03:36:32,030 --> 03:36:33,830
But I feel like we can go higher and...

5120
03:36:37,940 --> 03:36:39,740
Lucy is gonna become a streamer.

5121
03:36:42,340 --> 03:36:43,340
It's not as...

5122
03:36:43,340 --> 03:36:45,680
It's not as much as the model, but...

5123
03:36:46,580 --> 03:36:49,180
Minto, would you accept my flowers and kick my balls?

5124
03:36:49,640 --> 03:36:51,800
You don't kick the balls in basketball.

5125
03:36:51,800 --> 03:36:53,260
Ex-isi, thank you!

5126
03:36:55,220 --> 03:36:56,360
Does it look good?

5127
03:36:56,480 --> 03:36:57,020
Thank you!

5128
03:36:59,200 --> 03:37:00,500
Jay, thank you!

5129
03:37:01,000 --> 03:37:02,040
Except the job...

5130
03:37:02,040 --> 03:37:02,980
Charming Lucy...

5131
03:37:02,980 --> 03:37:03,900
Is now a charming streamer..

5132
03:37:06,220 --> 03:37:08,220
You guys, we're making...

5133
03:37:08,620 --> 03:37:09,520
Bank right now.

5134
03:37:09,900 --> 03:37:11,800
Aarin' Wisley are having a baby...

5135
03:37:15,440 --> 03:37:19,540
The baby... is... Joffrey.

5136
03:37:22,580 --> 03:37:23,520
Glitchfrey, thank you!

5137
03:37:24,020 --> 03:37:25,160
Sky Raider, thank you!

5138
03:37:25,840 --> 03:37:27,540
Is that what they mean by ball is life?

5139
03:37:27,700 --> 03:37:28,540
Raider, thank you!

5140
03:37:32,240 --> 03:37:33,160
Um... Joffrey.

5141
03:37:36,420 --> 03:37:39,160
Why is he so much more expensive than the other baby?

5142
03:37:39,660 --> 03:37:40,140
Oh!

5143
03:37:40,700 --> 03:37:41,180
Director!

5144
03:37:41,640 --> 03:37:43,400
$315 per second, let's go!

5145
03:37:44,980 --> 03:37:46,420
Oh my gosh, you guys.

5146
03:37:46,760 --> 03:37:48,560
We are making so much money now.

5147
03:37:48,740 --> 03:37:49,400
Private high school.

5148
03:37:49,740 --> 03:37:50,140
Mabel.

5149
03:37:51,220 --> 03:37:52,300
Ah, thank you guys!

5150
03:37:52,840 --> 03:37:54,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5151
03:37:54,700 --> 03:37:55,460
But, thank you.

5152
03:37:55,640 --> 03:37:57,360
I only have basketballs.

5153
03:37:57,880 --> 03:37:59,240
Are we married now?

5154
03:37:59,400 --> 03:37:59,640
Maybe.

5155
03:37:59,980 --> 03:38:02,180
Oh my gosh, I thought Brianna just died too.

5156
03:38:03,020 --> 03:38:04,740
They're only 47 and 48.

5157
03:38:05,500 --> 03:38:07,020
Don't forget to buy a house.

5158
03:38:07,180 --> 03:38:07,880
Oh, yeah.

5159
03:38:07,880 --> 03:38:11,720
Vernon didn't brush his teeth properly today, resulting in bad breath.

5160
03:38:11,880 --> 03:38:13,040
Vernon is a baby!

5161
03:38:15,200 --> 03:38:15,800
Vernon...

5162
03:38:15,800 --> 03:38:17,620
Vernon has no teeth.

5163
03:38:17,800 --> 03:38:19,200
Vernon was born yesterday.

5164
03:38:19,380 --> 03:38:21,760
Vernon is three years old!

5165
03:38:23,140 --> 03:38:25,300
Actually, when do babies start getting teeth?

5166
03:38:30,390 --> 03:38:32,590
When do babies start having teeth?

5167
03:38:33,450 --> 03:38:34,690
His singular tooth.

5168
03:38:35,390 --> 03:38:36,090
At two.

5169
03:38:36,590 --> 03:38:36,750
Oh.

5170
03:38:38,330 --> 03:38:39,830
Way before three.

5171
03:38:40,010 --> 03:38:42,370
I thought they were just gummy until like five.

5172
03:38:48,760 --> 03:38:50,540
Only brush your teeth once.

5173
03:38:51,660 --> 03:38:54,700
Vernon's breath has approved, but oral problems still exist.

5174
03:38:55,900 --> 03:38:57,220
Don't roll your eyes at me.

5175
03:38:58,280 --> 03:38:58,900
Uh-oh.

5176
03:38:59,280 --> 03:39:00,640
Our place is really crowded.

5177
03:39:02,020 --> 03:39:02,680
Uh...

5178
03:39:06,250 --> 03:39:07,630
Oh, they're unhappy.

5179
03:39:08,410 --> 03:39:09,070
Upgrade!

5180
03:39:10,870 --> 03:39:12,190
Okay, now we're happy.

5181
03:39:12,630 --> 03:39:13,490
Now it's fine.

5182
03:39:15,850 --> 03:39:18,670
It has been a long time since you were a child.

5183
03:39:18,850 --> 03:39:19,930
What do you mean?

5184
03:39:20,030 --> 03:39:22,050
You remembered your teeth growing in!

5185
03:39:23,010 --> 03:39:24,890
Joffrey likes to bite his own toes.

5186
03:39:27,450 --> 03:39:29,730
Like mother, like son.

5187
03:39:31,450 --> 03:39:34,010
Gotta put them chilies on Joffrey's toes.

5188
03:39:35,090 --> 03:39:39,070
Joffrey cried bitterly from the spiciness of chili pepper.

5189
03:39:39,250 --> 03:39:40,890
It didn't work on Joffrey!

5190
03:39:41,030 --> 03:39:41,930
He's too stupid!

5191
03:39:45,970 --> 03:39:48,350
They want another baby?

5192
03:39:49,050 --> 03:39:49,530
Okay.

5193
03:39:50,870 --> 03:39:53,230
Time for more babies.

5194
03:39:55,670 --> 03:39:57,190
This is...

5195
03:39:58,130 --> 03:39:58,890
Oscar.

5196
03:39:59,290 --> 03:40:00,150
Oh, Oscar.

5197
03:40:00,930 --> 03:40:02,490
Oscar is expensive.

5198
03:40:02,890 --> 03:40:04,370
Why is he so expensive?

5199
03:40:06,350 --> 03:40:08,050
Stop getting pregnant.

5200
03:40:08,630 --> 03:40:10,810
Joffrey's playmate hasn't played with him recently.

5201
03:40:11,130 --> 03:40:12,350
Joffrey is three.

5202
03:40:12,590 --> 03:40:14,690
He doesn't even know what a playmate is.

5203
03:40:15,470 --> 03:40:16,990
Ask the playmate for a reason.

5204
03:40:17,190 --> 03:40:17,570
He can...

5205
03:40:19,050 --> 03:40:21,390
Joffrey's playmate said he is sorry.

5206
03:40:22,010 --> 03:40:22,670
What?

5207
03:40:27,670 --> 03:40:29,170
Mabel is interested in cooking.

5208
03:40:29,490 --> 03:40:31,150
You have no talent.

5209
03:40:37,470 --> 03:40:39,150
It has charm decrease.

5210
03:40:39,450 --> 03:40:40,550
I don't understand why.

5211
03:40:42,250 --> 03:40:44,150
You have no talent, Mabel.

5212
03:40:45,590 --> 03:40:47,430
Mabel suffered a heavy blow.

5213
03:40:50,930 --> 03:40:53,310
The descriptions in this game are killing me.

5214
03:40:53,530 --> 03:40:53,890
Oh, wait!

5215
03:40:54,830 --> 03:40:56,470
We can unlock something.

5216
03:40:56,750 --> 03:40:59,910
Brianna was favored by a rich person and received 100k.

5217
03:41:01,050 --> 03:41:02,110
We can...

5218
03:41:02,110 --> 03:41:02,430
Wait.

5219
03:41:02,750 --> 03:41:03,710
Unattractive Aaron?

5220
03:41:04,230 --> 03:41:06,290
Is she back to being unattractive?

5221
03:41:06,870 --> 03:41:08,330
I thought she was intelligent.

5222
03:41:12,080 --> 03:41:14,280
I had a dream we were cuddling last night.

5223
03:41:14,380 --> 03:41:15,080
What does it mean?

5224
03:41:18,360 --> 03:41:20,640
It means you should buy my Daki Makura.

5225
03:41:23,720 --> 03:41:24,360
Wait.

5226
03:41:24,700 --> 03:41:24,980
Wait.

5227
03:41:24,980 --> 03:41:26,020
Forced Mabel to exercise.

5228
03:41:28,500 --> 03:41:29,140
Wait.

5229
03:41:29,660 --> 03:41:31,760
No, see, it's knowledgeable Aaron.

5230
03:41:32,120 --> 03:41:33,980
When did she become unattractive again?

5231
03:41:35,760 --> 03:41:37,860
When did she become unattractive?

5232
03:41:38,520 --> 03:41:41,200
Brianna was made to Aaron a distant relative's will.

5233
03:41:41,400 --> 03:41:42,840
Holy moly, 50.

5234
03:41:45,480 --> 03:41:46,800
Let's do...

5235
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:48,100
Let's do...

5236
03:41:48,100 --> 03:41:52,980
Let Oscar skip the growth period and become 18 years old directly.

5237
03:41:53,480 --> 03:41:54,880
Why only Oscar?

5238
03:41:56,020 --> 03:41:58,480
We'll do that once we get another baby.

5239
03:41:59,800 --> 03:42:03,100
Vernon saw a strong boy bullying a puppy.

5240
03:42:03,640 --> 03:42:06,820
Vernon is five years old.

5241
03:42:09,420 --> 03:42:11,460
Step forward to stop.

5242
03:42:13,480 --> 03:42:16,360
Vernon and the puppy defeated the other party together.

5243
03:42:19,200 --> 03:42:20,500
D-Dog!

5244
03:42:23,580 --> 03:42:24,940
Vernon's a hero!

5245
03:42:26,280 --> 03:42:27,980
What did he mean defeated?

5246
03:42:28,760 --> 03:42:30,140
This is getting intense.

5247
03:42:30,720 --> 03:42:32,120
Mabel dislikes doing chores.

5248
03:42:32,640 --> 03:42:33,940
Do chores or get beaten.

5249
03:42:34,500 --> 03:42:36,200
Mabel now does her chores.

5250
03:42:36,200 --> 03:42:37,420
Mabel's a hero.

5251
03:42:40,830 --> 03:42:41,670
Mabel's a hero.

5252
03:42:41,670 --> 03:42:42,110
Strong burn!

5253
03:42:43,790 --> 03:42:45,090
Private elementary.

5254
03:42:45,370 --> 03:42:46,270
Buff babies.

5255
03:42:46,730 --> 03:42:47,070
Yeah.

5256
03:42:48,810 --> 03:42:50,970
Punish snake and diamond dog.

5257
03:42:51,890 --> 03:42:55,810
Charming Lucy, a co-worker next to Lucy, has smelly feet.

5258
03:42:56,110 --> 03:43:02,870
Ask the boss to fire the colleague and it's a 100% chance.

5259
03:43:10,230 --> 03:43:10,830
Resign!

5260
03:43:11,570 --> 03:43:12,670
Patient is the key.

5261
03:43:13,130 --> 03:43:13,310
Patient is the key.

5262
03:43:13,310 --> 03:43:15,370
Send co-worker feet deodorant as gift.

5263
03:43:16,070 --> 03:43:16,730
I'm gonna...

5264
03:43:16,730 --> 03:43:19,030
We're gonna fire the person over having smelly feet.

5265
03:43:19,710 --> 03:43:22,410
The boss agreed with Lucy and fired Lucy's colleague.

5266
03:43:25,110 --> 03:43:26,650
Lucy's a streamer!

5267
03:43:29,090 --> 03:43:30,790
Who is Lucy's colleague?

5268
03:43:31,430 --> 03:43:33,210
Is she not her own boss?

5269
03:43:34,350 --> 03:43:37,370
Daniel found a hungry and injured dog near the flower buds in the neighborhood.

5270
03:43:37,510 --> 03:43:37,830
Take it home.

5271
03:43:38,130 --> 03:43:38,710
I kinda...

5272
03:43:38,710 --> 03:43:40,810
Oh my gosh, they're getting up there in age.

5273
03:43:40,910 --> 03:43:42,150
I kinda wanna see them die.

5274
03:43:44,010 --> 03:43:44,890
Happy Joffrey.

5275
03:43:45,090 --> 03:43:46,390
Go to private elementary school.

5276
03:43:46,650 --> 03:43:48,650
We're a rich family, so...

5277
03:43:49,830 --> 03:43:52,510
Public IV for our intelligent Mabel.

5278
03:43:53,130 --> 03:43:55,190
She's going to major in...

5279
03:43:55,190 --> 03:43:56,590
Wait, didn't she like...

5280
03:43:56,590 --> 03:43:57,790
Can she...

5281
03:43:57,790 --> 03:43:58,750
Can she do...

5282
03:43:58,750 --> 03:43:59,850
Can she do food?

5283
03:44:00,850 --> 03:44:01,330
No.

5284
03:44:03,210 --> 03:44:03,890
Biology.

5285
03:44:05,450 --> 03:44:06,810
Let them be ghosts.

5286
03:44:06,930 --> 03:44:07,790
I wanna see them die.

5287
03:44:09,510 --> 03:44:11,530
Vernon often feels drowsy.

5288
03:44:12,450 --> 03:44:12,790
Sleep.

5289
03:44:14,590 --> 03:44:18,370
He experiences an impact on his physical health and academic performance.

5290
03:44:18,650 --> 03:44:19,950
Uh-oh.

5291
03:44:24,910 --> 03:44:25,970
Oscar wants a tree house.

5292
03:44:26,410 --> 03:44:27,250
Oscar's five.

5293
03:44:28,250 --> 03:44:29,250
Build a tree house.

5294
03:44:29,430 --> 03:44:31,610
Give Oscar a design drawing of the tree house.

5295
03:44:32,550 --> 03:44:35,050
Tell Oscar not to tree.

5296
03:44:53,830 --> 03:44:55,450
It's true, Oscar.

5297
03:44:55,930 --> 03:44:58,270
It's better for you to learn when you're young.

5298
03:44:59,590 --> 03:45:02,130
Oscar was very disappointed.

5299
03:45:02,130 --> 03:45:04,250
Everybody lost happiness.

5300
03:45:07,790 --> 03:45:09,490
Happy Oscar.

5301
03:45:10,690 --> 03:45:11,290
Uh...

5302
03:45:11,290 --> 03:45:12,090
Private elementary.

5303
03:45:13,690 --> 03:45:15,230
Good job, everybody!

5304
03:45:17,250 --> 03:45:20,890
The boss wants Lucy to be his...

5305
03:45:21,710 --> 03:45:24,520
F... W... B...

5306
03:45:24,520 --> 03:45:26,820
Man, this is just like my childhood.

5307
03:45:27,360 --> 03:45:28,000
What is that?

5308
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:29,660
F... W... B...

5309
03:45:31,900 --> 03:45:33,680
Oscar had to learn sometime.

5310
03:45:36,340 --> 03:45:37,560
Friends with the benefits!

5311
03:45:41,220 --> 03:45:43,440
Stand out and file a report.

5312
03:45:43,700 --> 03:45:44,200
I think...

5313
03:45:44,200 --> 03:45:46,020
Okay, we're gonna cause a little bit of drama.

5314
03:45:46,760 --> 03:45:47,280
Except...

5315
03:45:47,280 --> 03:45:52,180
Lucy became the boss's mistress and received a high salary and bonus.

5316
03:45:59,620 --> 03:46:03,460
Aaron has been replaced by someone else in her position leading in an awkward situation.

5317
03:46:05,020 --> 03:46:06,700
Look for opportunities for promotion.

5318
03:46:10,020 --> 03:46:12,240
She's a streamer who's her boss.

5319
03:46:12,240 --> 03:46:15,640
Vernon feels all the articles they write are terrible.

5320
03:46:16,520 --> 03:46:17,640
What are you doing?

5321
03:46:18,020 --> 03:46:19,820
Why are you writing articles?

5322
03:46:20,400 --> 03:46:21,980
At eight years old?

5323
03:46:30,450 --> 03:46:31,810
Corpo streamer.

5324
03:46:31,890 --> 03:46:32,370
Scary!

5325
03:46:37,300 --> 03:46:37,540
Scary!

5326
03:46:37,880 --> 03:46:39,160
Copy the homework.

5327
03:46:39,420 --> 03:46:40,180
Read some novels.

5328
03:46:40,340 --> 03:46:42,300
Try to be creative, idiot.

5329
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:43,760
Oh, it worked.

5330
03:46:44,980 --> 03:46:46,920
Just be creative, stupid.

5331
03:46:48,320 --> 03:46:51,260
Mabel and Wesley met at an environmental rally.

5332
03:46:52,560 --> 03:46:55,320
Question the environmental protection movement methods.

5333
03:46:55,640 --> 03:46:57,160
Share environmental protection ideas.

5334
03:46:57,360 --> 03:46:58,780
Wait, how much does Wesley make?

5335
03:47:02,220 --> 03:47:03,520
Go away, Wesley.

5336
03:47:04,600 --> 03:47:05,440
You're still alive!

5337
03:47:05,440 --> 03:47:06,160
I'm so happy!

5338
03:47:06,400 --> 03:47:06,660
Hello!

5339
03:47:07,900 --> 03:47:10,140
Oh my gosh, it's almost been four hours.

5340
03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:14,320
Vernon is anxious about...

5341
03:47:14,320 --> 03:47:14,900
Practice more.

5342
03:47:17,360 --> 03:47:18,980
How could you?

5343
03:47:19,840 --> 03:47:20,480
Wait.

5344
03:47:21,880 --> 03:47:23,620
Oh, come on, man.

5345
03:47:24,060 --> 03:47:26,220
Mabel knocked Travis's water over at the gym.

5346
03:47:27,360 --> 03:47:28,780
Mabel's kind of a bitch.

5347
03:47:30,660 --> 03:47:31,720
Blame Travis.

5348
03:47:32,600 --> 03:47:34,240
Travis felt offended and left.

5349
03:47:35,280 --> 03:47:35,720
Bien!

5350
03:47:40,710 --> 03:47:43,730
Mabel got in an accident with Vern.

5351
03:47:45,250 --> 03:47:45,890
Yeah!

5352
03:47:46,610 --> 03:47:48,030
I honestly admit mistake.

5353
03:47:48,190 --> 03:47:49,290
Try to tell a silly...

5354
03:47:49,290 --> 03:47:50,630
Oh, you know...

5355
03:47:57,250 --> 03:47:57,850
Oh...

5356
03:47:57,850 --> 03:47:58,230
Oh...

5357
03:47:58,230 --> 03:47:59,170
Silly me...

5358
03:47:59,170 --> 03:47:59,730
Oh...

5359
03:47:59,730 --> 03:48:00,690
Oh...

5360
03:48:00,690 --> 03:48:02,290
Oh, did I accidentally...

5361
03:48:02,290 --> 03:48:03,070
Make a little...

5362
03:48:03,070 --> 03:48:03,550
Oh, wait...

5363
03:48:03,550 --> 03:48:05,630
Because it's a little accident...

5364
03:48:05,630 --> 03:48:05,930
Oh...

5365
03:48:08,910 --> 03:48:09,510
Oh...

5366
03:48:09,510 --> 03:48:09,790
Oh...

5367
03:48:09,790 --> 03:48:09,810
Oh...

5368
03:48:09,810 --> 03:48:10,010
Oh...

5369
03:48:10,890 --> 03:48:11,490
Sorry...

5370
03:48:11,490 --> 03:48:12,970
Tell a silly joke.

5371
03:48:14,110 --> 03:48:14,350
Oh!

5372
03:48:16,450 --> 03:48:18,370
Vern was angry and slapped him.

5373
03:48:18,570 --> 03:48:19,970
Damn, he slapped her!

5374
03:48:21,950 --> 03:48:23,550
Oh, we missed our chance.

5375
03:48:23,570 --> 03:48:24,950
I thought the joke would work.

5376
03:48:26,770 --> 03:48:31,010
Lucy and Daniel feel having another child to make their family...

5377
03:48:31,910 --> 03:48:33,690
Even though Lucy is a mistress?

5378
03:48:34,410 --> 03:48:35,270
Have the baby!

5379
03:48:35,390 --> 03:48:36,010
Have the baby!

5380
03:48:38,370 --> 03:48:40,290
Unlock medical major in university.

5381
03:48:40,570 --> 03:48:40,890
Let's go.

5382
03:48:45,230 --> 03:48:46,030
Let's see.

5383
03:48:46,170 --> 03:48:46,730
A name.

5384
03:48:47,990 --> 03:48:49,090
Corey Stefan.

5385
03:48:50,770 --> 03:48:51,370
Roger.

5386
03:48:52,750 --> 03:48:53,350
Roger.

5387
03:48:58,480 --> 03:48:59,940
Corey in the house.

5388
03:49:00,760 --> 03:49:01,440
Middle school.

5389
03:49:03,520 --> 03:49:04,120
Okay.

5390
03:49:04,720 --> 03:49:06,060
Mabel has graduated from university.

5391
03:49:06,640 --> 03:49:08,020
Celebrate all night with classmates.

5392
03:49:09,620 --> 03:49:12,220
Mabel was celebrating all night and didn't get enough sleep.

5393
03:49:12,920 --> 03:49:14,160
She can sleep?

5394
03:49:14,400 --> 03:49:17,660
Why does her happiness and everything go down?

5395
03:49:17,820 --> 03:49:19,200
She just got to sleep a little bit.

5396
03:49:19,620 --> 03:49:19,720
Oh.

5397
03:49:20,520 --> 03:49:21,460
Sales director.

5398
03:49:23,060 --> 03:49:23,660
Wait.

5399
03:49:23,740 --> 03:49:25,580
Is Mabel never going to find somebody now?

5400
03:49:27,580 --> 03:49:28,240
Oh.

5401
03:49:29,400 --> 03:49:30,060
Joel.

5402
03:49:30,600 --> 03:49:32,900
Joel makes an acceptable amount of money.

5403
03:49:33,580 --> 03:49:34,280
Oh my gosh.

5404
03:49:34,360 --> 03:49:35,740
They're playing basketball together.

5405
03:49:41,080 --> 03:49:43,100
It's always basketball.

5406
03:49:43,280 --> 03:49:44,300
It's basketball again.

5407
03:49:45,380 --> 03:49:50,420
I kind of want to get rid of him so that we can see another, like, encounter, you know?

5408
03:49:51,620 --> 03:49:52,440
Wait one second.

5409
03:49:53,860 --> 03:49:54,120
What?

5410
03:50:00,410 --> 03:50:00,770
Oh.

5411
03:50:02,190 --> 03:50:02,690
Hold on.

5412
03:50:02,730 --> 03:50:03,030
Sorry.

5413
03:50:03,510 --> 03:50:03,650
Oh.

5414
03:50:03,790 --> 03:50:04,050
There we go.

5415
03:50:04,150 --> 03:50:04,290
Okay.

5416
03:50:06,690 --> 03:50:08,330
Let's get rid of him.

5417
03:50:09,470 --> 03:50:09,550
Okay.

5418
03:50:13,260 --> 03:50:14,500
Joffrey middle school.

5419
03:50:14,920 --> 03:50:15,520
Go, Joffrey.

5420
03:50:15,620 --> 03:50:15,800
Go.

5421
03:50:16,580 --> 03:50:17,180
Oh my god.

5422
03:50:17,200 --> 03:50:18,560
I think the parents are going to die soon.

5423
03:50:19,720 --> 03:50:22,060
Mabel knocked Jonathan's water over at the gym.

5424
03:50:23,160 --> 03:50:24,060
Blame Jonathan.

5425
03:50:24,720 --> 03:50:27,160
She keeps losing her charm, though.

5426
03:50:27,560 --> 03:50:29,480
Her happiness is going down, too.

5427
03:50:30,180 --> 03:50:31,180
You'll find somebody.

5428
03:50:31,320 --> 03:50:31,820
Don't worry.

5429
03:50:34,820 --> 03:50:35,580
Joffrey.

5430
03:50:36,240 --> 03:50:37,360
We upgraded our home, too.

5431
03:50:44,310 --> 03:50:44,730
Hmm.

5432
03:50:44,970 --> 03:50:46,870
Joffrey was late for school again today.

5433
03:50:49,070 --> 03:50:50,390
Find a better...

5434
03:50:50,390 --> 03:50:50,490
Oh.

5435
03:50:50,590 --> 03:50:51,870
Wake up earlier, stupid.

5436
03:50:52,670 --> 03:50:52,990
Yeah.

5437
03:50:54,470 --> 03:50:55,970
Oscar is in middle school.

5438
03:50:57,410 --> 03:50:58,170
Okay.

5439
03:51:01,220 --> 03:51:02,360
Strong Vernon.

5440
03:51:02,780 --> 03:51:05,900
Always gets poor grades in physical education.

5441
03:51:06,540 --> 03:51:06,960
Redo.

5442
03:51:07,340 --> 03:51:08,000
Okay.

5443
03:51:09,340 --> 03:51:10,840
I want to see the parents die.

5444
03:51:10,980 --> 03:51:12,260
And then I think I'll end it there.

5445
03:51:13,340 --> 03:51:13,700
Mint.

5446
03:51:13,800 --> 03:51:15,560
Will Mabel ever find anybody?

5447
03:51:15,820 --> 03:51:17,180
Also, it rejects multiple students.

5448
03:51:17,320 --> 03:51:20,800
It's because I want to see a new interaction.

5449
03:51:22,140 --> 03:51:24,820
Unattractive Roger likes to destroy his own toys.

5450
03:51:26,340 --> 03:51:28,540
Tell Roger to cherish the toys.

5451
03:51:29,460 --> 03:51:30,560
Basketball with me?

5452
03:51:33,580 --> 03:51:35,020
Yeah, I'm still alive.

5453
03:51:40,180 --> 03:51:41,080
High school.

5454
03:51:41,700 --> 03:51:43,640
We can't send them to the best high school.

5455
03:51:43,860 --> 03:51:45,240
We've kind of blown through our...

5456
03:51:46,760 --> 03:51:47,960
Through our...

5457
03:51:47,960 --> 03:51:49,400
Lottery money.

5458
03:51:49,580 --> 03:51:50,620
We got a...

5459
03:51:50,620 --> 03:51:51,900
Another baby?

5460
03:51:52,020 --> 03:51:53,180
My god!

5461
03:51:54,540 --> 03:51:55,700
Have the baby!

5462
03:51:55,900 --> 03:51:56,780
Have the baby!

5463
03:51:57,040 --> 03:51:57,640
My...

5464
03:51:57,640 --> 03:51:58,000
Wait.

5465
03:52:00,580 --> 03:52:01,180
Uh...

5466
03:52:01,180 --> 03:52:02,640
Let's see.

5467
03:52:03,280 --> 03:52:04,480
Another Joffrey!

5468
03:52:04,820 --> 03:52:05,140
Oh my gosh.

5469
03:52:05,240 --> 03:52:06,540
The two Joffreys can fight.

5470
03:52:08,740 --> 03:52:09,940
Okay, now...

5471
03:52:10,600 --> 03:52:16,180
We're gonna do it so Roger skips to 18 years old.

5472
03:52:17,020 --> 03:52:18,760
Unattractive Roger is now 18.

5473
03:52:19,060 --> 03:52:20,720
And he's going to university, baby!

5474
03:52:20,720 --> 03:52:22,900
And he's gonna be...

5475
03:52:24,080 --> 03:52:24,800
Physics.

5476
03:52:27,740 --> 03:52:30,260
Suddenly, our baby is an adult.

5477
03:52:30,640 --> 03:52:31,680
It's kind of crazy.

5478
03:52:33,480 --> 03:52:37,820
Bradford has reached retirement age and there's a job vacancy in our family business small diner.

5479
03:52:38,240 --> 03:52:39,780
We might face losses.

5480
03:52:41,820 --> 03:52:43,640
Automatically assign a successor?

5481
03:52:48,070 --> 03:52:50,390
Brianna is assigned to small diner.

5482
03:52:50,810 --> 03:52:51,310
Oh.

5483
03:52:51,630 --> 03:52:52,130
Okay.

5484
03:52:53,250 --> 03:52:54,210
That was easy.

5485
03:52:54,590 --> 03:52:55,070
Nepotism.

5486
03:52:55,270 --> 03:52:56,230
But it's his wife!

5487
03:53:01,470 --> 03:53:02,610
It's his wife!

5488
03:53:03,470 --> 03:53:05,770
Hope Lucy gets her comeuppance for cheating.

5489
03:53:05,910 --> 03:53:06,270
Me too!

5490
03:53:06,470 --> 03:53:07,550
I want to see something happen.

5491
03:53:09,310 --> 03:53:10,190
Hey, Joffrey!

5492
03:53:11,290 --> 03:53:12,710
Look how many babies we have.

5493
03:53:12,790 --> 03:53:13,030
Uh-oh.

5494
03:53:13,350 --> 03:53:13,710
Guys.

5495
03:53:14,430 --> 03:53:16,210
We're gonna be negative money soon.

5496
03:53:19,690 --> 03:53:21,210
We're gonna be negative money soon.

5497
03:53:21,210 --> 03:53:23,050
Nepo wife, true.

5498
03:53:25,010 --> 03:53:25,430
Wiki!

5499
03:53:26,230 --> 03:53:26,930
Nice.

5500
03:53:27,330 --> 03:53:28,470
Wikipedia worked.

5501
03:53:29,690 --> 03:53:29,850
Huh!

5502
03:53:31,070 --> 03:53:32,390
Maybe it's a basketball.

5503
03:53:32,850 --> 03:53:34,490
It's a basketball again.

5504
03:53:36,630 --> 03:53:38,790
It's always gotta be basketball!

5505
03:53:40,870 --> 03:53:42,990
These kids need jobs.

5506
03:53:44,590 --> 03:53:46,190
Lucy is the one with three kids.

5507
03:53:46,570 --> 03:53:47,210
Mm-hmm.

5508
03:53:48,670 --> 03:53:50,210
Playing slot for four hours.

5509
03:53:50,430 --> 03:53:50,690
Hey!

5510
03:53:51,070 --> 03:53:52,150
Yeah, that's me.

5511
03:53:55,530 --> 03:53:56,030
Reynaldo.

5512
03:53:56,790 --> 03:53:57,890
Reynaldo and Mabel.

5513
03:53:58,890 --> 03:54:00,210
Wait, now Brianna.

5514
03:54:00,370 --> 03:54:01,790
Brianna, you just got assigned.

5515
03:54:02,650 --> 03:54:02,790
Okay.

5516
03:54:03,290 --> 03:54:05,430
Aut- Automatically assign a successor.

5517
03:54:06,830 --> 03:54:08,250
Middle-aged Wesley.

5518
03:54:08,590 --> 03:54:10,630
He looks just like her dad.

5519
03:54:12,630 --> 03:54:13,230
She?

5520
03:54:14,490 --> 03:54:15,090
She?

5521
03:54:17,650 --> 03:54:18,790
Oh, stop, stop.

5522
03:54:19,090 --> 03:54:20,190
Daniel's pet passed away.

5523
03:54:20,290 --> 03:54:20,870
That's so sad.

5524
03:54:21,370 --> 03:54:25,130
Erin married someone that looks exactly like her father.

5525
03:54:25,390 --> 03:54:27,130
I just want to let you guys know that.

5526
03:54:28,210 --> 03:54:29,170
Like, actually.

5527
03:54:29,450 --> 03:54:31,730
A hundred- This is the same exact little model.

5528
03:54:36,210 --> 03:54:38,490
Vernon brought a classmate home with him.

5529
03:54:40,130 --> 03:54:40,730
Ooh.

5530
03:54:41,230 --> 03:54:41,850
Ignore it.

5531
03:54:42,530 --> 03:54:44,710
Vernon had a pleasant day with his classmate.

5532
03:54:45,530 --> 03:54:47,610
I like how it's like, ignore it.

5533
03:54:48,030 --> 03:54:49,970
Like, ignore the creature.

5534
03:54:50,630 --> 03:54:53,050
That just came into our apartment.

5535
03:54:53,410 --> 03:54:54,330
Or our home.

5536
03:54:55,730 --> 03:54:56,330
Joffrey!

5537
03:54:57,010 --> 03:54:58,330
Snatched the toys from others.

5538
03:54:58,730 --> 03:55:01,570
Joffrey gets along worse with kids after taking their toys.

5539
03:55:02,070 --> 03:55:03,310
Joffrey's a little shit.

5540
03:55:04,050 --> 03:55:04,930
Childish Joffrey.

5541
03:55:08,630 --> 03:55:10,830
No, we can't have any- No, Mabel, sorry.

5542
03:55:10,970 --> 03:55:11,770
It's not a good time.

5543
03:55:12,150 --> 03:55:13,470
We can't have any more babies.

5544
03:55:14,190 --> 03:55:15,810
Lucy is sucking us dry.

5545
03:55:18,110 --> 03:55:20,070
The family wants to go camping.

5546
03:55:21,530 --> 03:55:25,950
Go camping on Mars with a budget of- What?

5547
03:55:28,710 --> 03:55:31,210
Wait, but I want to see the parents die.

5548
03:55:35,480 --> 03:55:36,860
Wait, the boss too?

5549
03:55:37,320 --> 03:55:38,780
No, these are the children.

5550
03:55:40,100 --> 03:55:44,110
With what budget?

5551
03:55:44,530 --> 03:55:46,830
If we go into the red, you guys...

5552
03:55:47,410 --> 03:55:49,490
I won't be able to see the parents die.

5553
03:55:50,510 --> 03:55:51,730
Can you save, Scum?

5554
03:55:51,750 --> 03:55:52,810
I don't think in this game.

5555
03:55:54,890 --> 03:55:56,290
A budget of what?

5556
03:56:03,050 --> 03:56:04,570
Take me to Mars, Mito.

5557
03:56:04,930 --> 03:56:06,110
I am getting tired, though.

5558
03:56:06,590 --> 03:56:07,150
Let's see it.

5559
03:56:07,630 --> 03:56:08,610
Let's see what happens.

5560
03:56:10,150 --> 03:56:12,690
Our family members successfully landed on Mars.

5561
03:56:12,990 --> 03:56:16,010
Looking at the scene before them, they felt everything was unbelievable.

5562
03:56:16,630 --> 03:56:17,410
Alright, let's see.

5563
03:56:18,630 --> 03:56:19,670
Camp on Mars.

5564
03:56:19,810 --> 03:56:20,530
No, can't do that.

5565
03:56:20,690 --> 03:56:22,450
Mito, it's a little P-Flix fire.

5566
03:56:22,450 --> 03:56:24,990
Let's see if there was a money loss.

5567
03:56:27,030 --> 03:56:27,070
Oh.

5568
03:56:30,940 --> 03:56:32,580
We just were able to do that.

5569
03:56:35,280 --> 03:56:36,900
Vernon will go into medical.

5570
03:56:39,580 --> 03:56:41,280
Free trip to Mars, baby.

5571
03:56:41,760 --> 03:56:42,760
Roger graduated.

5572
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:44,940
Tearing up all his books.

5573
03:56:45,480 --> 03:56:48,300
Roger tore up his books, feeling much more relieved.

5574
03:56:51,160 --> 03:56:52,660
Fox, thanks for the gifted.

5575
03:56:53,200 --> 03:56:53,600
Thank you.

5576
03:56:53,700 --> 03:56:54,880
The boss paid for it.

5577
03:56:55,040 --> 03:56:55,280
Ah.

5578
03:56:57,060 --> 03:56:58,980
No, no baby, Mabel.

5579
03:56:59,080 --> 03:57:00,160
No baby, no baby.

5580
03:57:00,400 --> 03:57:00,580
Wait.

5581
03:57:03,080 --> 03:57:05,960
Daniel and Rinaldo look the exact same.

5582
03:57:07,460 --> 03:57:08,200
Oh my gosh.

5583
03:57:08,260 --> 03:57:09,620
Happy Joffrey.

5584
03:57:12,640 --> 03:57:13,680
Happy Joffrey.

5585
03:57:13,900 --> 03:57:14,560
Going to school.

5586
03:57:15,060 --> 03:57:15,240
Another.

5587
03:57:15,400 --> 03:57:16,840
It's two happy Joffreys.

5588
03:57:17,640 --> 03:57:21,160
This happy Joffrey will choose music, just like his grandpappies.

5589
03:57:23,820 --> 03:57:24,980
Stop getting pregnant.

5590
03:57:26,120 --> 03:57:27,260
Roger found the joff...

5591
03:57:27,260 --> 03:57:27,580
No.

5592
03:57:28,300 --> 03:57:28,740
Refresh.

5593
03:57:30,160 --> 03:57:30,600
Driver.

5594
03:57:31,500 --> 03:57:33,080
Is it because you're unattractive, Roger?

5595
03:57:33,220 --> 03:57:34,720
Is that why you can't get paid well?

5596
03:57:36,580 --> 03:57:37,020
Receptionist.

5597
03:57:37,740 --> 03:57:38,180
Rider.

5598
03:57:38,580 --> 03:57:39,320
You know I'll take that.

5599
03:57:39,560 --> 03:57:40,960
Rami, thanks so much for the gifted.

5600
03:57:41,140 --> 03:57:41,480
Thank you.

5601
03:57:43,060 --> 03:57:45,000
As long as you're making some money, you know.

5602
03:57:45,180 --> 03:57:45,820
Everybody else...

5603
03:57:45,820 --> 03:57:46,780
Who is this?

5604
03:57:47,000 --> 03:57:47,820
Who is this?

5605
03:57:48,100 --> 03:57:53,120
Oscar, why are you costing me almost $450 per second?

5606
03:57:54,160 --> 03:57:56,220
Wesley reports a poisoning incident.

5607
03:57:56,480 --> 03:57:57,200
Punish, Wesley.

5608
03:58:01,960 --> 03:58:04,920
Oscar is going to a public ivy.

5609
03:58:05,140 --> 03:58:06,560
We're going to do philosophy.

5610
03:58:07,120 --> 03:58:09,940
You don't have a real career.

5611
03:58:13,240 --> 03:58:15,280
YouTube playable called Family Life.

5612
03:58:17,860 --> 03:58:18,740
That's this.

5613
03:58:21,300 --> 03:58:22,180
That's this.

5614
03:58:24,040 --> 03:58:25,760
Why is punishment work so well?

5615
03:58:25,860 --> 03:58:26,380
I don't know.

5616
03:58:26,980 --> 03:58:27,780
Joffrey is anxious.

5617
03:58:27,980 --> 03:58:28,680
Practice more, buddy.

5618
03:58:30,220 --> 03:58:31,760
I need these parents to die style.

5619
03:58:33,200 --> 03:58:33,540
Fine.

5620
03:58:33,700 --> 03:58:34,300
Have the baby.

5621
03:58:34,460 --> 03:58:34,920
I don't care.

5622
03:58:34,920 --> 03:58:35,780
Have the baby.

5623
03:58:35,900 --> 03:58:36,440
Have the baby.

5624
03:58:36,580 --> 03:58:37,400
Search for it online.

5625
03:58:41,610 --> 03:58:42,210
Oh.

5626
03:58:44,230 --> 03:58:45,510
She didn't have...

5627
03:58:45,510 --> 03:58:46,470
She lost the baby.

5628
03:58:47,210 --> 03:58:48,570
Roger and Samantha.

5629
03:58:48,850 --> 03:58:49,730
How much do you make, Samantha?

5630
03:58:50,030 --> 03:58:50,590
Damn!

5631
03:58:51,250 --> 03:58:52,490
Give Samantha a flower.

5632
03:58:53,310 --> 03:58:54,350
And now they're married.

5633
03:58:59,510 --> 03:59:01,110
And before they live to $100.

5634
03:59:01,110 --> 03:59:02,110
Because they're...

5635
03:59:02,110 --> 03:59:04,190
They're dang rich.

5636
03:59:04,190 --> 03:59:07,330
They only make $35 per second.

5637
03:59:08,250 --> 03:59:09,630
Brendan and Layla.

5638
03:59:10,050 --> 03:59:11,150
How much does Layla mean?

5639
03:59:11,830 --> 03:59:12,590
Oh, Layla.

5640
03:59:13,050 --> 03:59:13,670
Oh, Layla.

5641
03:59:14,810 --> 03:59:15,770
Goodbye, Layla.

5642
03:59:19,010 --> 03:59:21,850
We need someone more than 80 bucks.

5643
03:59:22,270 --> 03:59:22,410
You know?

5644
03:59:23,450 --> 03:59:23,970
Hannah!

5645
03:59:26,990 --> 03:59:27,510
Basketball.

5646
03:59:27,630 --> 03:59:28,530
Play basketball together.

5647
03:59:29,070 --> 03:59:30,730
I was trying to wonder how they do this punishment.

5648
03:59:33,210 --> 03:59:34,810
Mateo, thank you so much for the 20 gift.

5649
03:59:34,810 --> 03:59:35,710
Thank you.

5650
03:59:37,970 --> 03:59:40,550
I wish I could skip forward faster.

5651
03:59:43,650 --> 03:59:44,810
Faster, faster.

5652
03:59:45,250 --> 03:59:46,370
Oh, I paused it on action.

5653
03:59:47,450 --> 03:59:48,170
Die, parents.

5654
03:59:48,210 --> 03:59:48,530
Die.

5655
03:59:48,810 --> 03:59:49,670
He's almost 70.

5656
03:59:50,750 --> 03:59:52,030
Elderly Bradford.

5657
03:59:52,570 --> 03:59:54,090
A baby already?

5658
03:59:55,030 --> 03:59:56,650
We are making more money.

5659
03:59:58,030 --> 03:59:58,710
No.

5660
03:59:59,410 --> 04:00:01,230
I don't want to upgrade our home.

5661
04:00:02,150 --> 04:00:03,270
It's so ex...

5662
04:00:03,270 --> 04:00:04,430
It's 100k!

5663
04:00:04,890 --> 04:00:05,750
It's a upgrade!

5664
04:00:06,250 --> 04:00:07,190
We can't.

5665
04:00:07,310 --> 04:00:07,950
We can't.

5666
04:00:10,610 --> 04:00:13,630
Our diner only makes 72 bucks.

5667
04:00:14,110 --> 04:00:15,390
Oh, now it makes even less.

5668
04:00:15,550 --> 04:00:16,150
Wait, okay, hold on.

5669
04:00:18,490 --> 04:00:19,510
Raynaldo, get in there.

5670
04:00:21,190 --> 04:00:22,470
How much does it make now?

5671
04:00:22,670 --> 04:00:23,150
190.

5672
04:00:23,470 --> 04:00:23,830
There we go.

5673
04:00:25,770 --> 04:00:26,250
Joffrey!

5674
04:00:29,410 --> 04:00:30,290
First, Joffrey.

5675
04:00:30,510 --> 04:00:30,890
Oh my gosh.

5676
04:00:30,990 --> 04:00:33,510
You guys spend so much dang money.

5677
04:00:34,830 --> 04:00:36,750
Joffrey was asked to give a speech.

5678
04:00:36,950 --> 04:00:38,110
Give a speech on environment...

5679
04:00:38,110 --> 04:00:40,450
Why are they so obsessed with environmental issues?

5680
04:00:40,830 --> 04:00:41,410
I have...

5681
04:00:41,410 --> 04:00:42,030
I have...

5682
04:00:42,030 --> 04:00:43,130
A dream.

5683
04:00:47,650 --> 04:00:49,110
Average your hands and welcome to membership.

5684
04:00:49,490 --> 04:00:49,830
And...

5685
04:00:49,830 --> 04:00:50,870
I feel guys welcome to membership.

5686
04:00:51,030 --> 04:00:51,790
Thank you guys so much.

5687
04:00:51,870 --> 04:00:52,310
Thank you.

5688
04:00:52,990 --> 04:00:54,010
I have a dream.

5689
04:00:55,170 --> 04:00:57,570
Everyone thought Joffrey had a promising future.

5690
04:01:00,970 --> 04:01:03,630
Let's quit dreaming while you're ahead, says...

5691
04:01:03,630 --> 04:01:05,790
Says Oscar over here.

5692
04:01:10,300 --> 04:01:12,720
Oscar, graduate and get ready for work, buddy.

5693
04:01:13,120 --> 04:01:13,640
You...

5694
04:01:13,640 --> 04:01:15,660
You need to work more than anybody else.

5695
04:01:15,660 --> 04:01:17,040
You are making nothing.

5696
04:01:17,560 --> 04:01:19,000
I, too, had a dream.

5697
04:01:22,160 --> 04:01:23,940
Except, take whatever you got.

5698
04:01:24,120 --> 04:01:24,560
Take it.

5699
04:01:24,740 --> 04:01:25,160
Please.

5700
04:01:25,720 --> 04:01:26,960
We need the money.

5701
04:01:27,780 --> 04:01:29,080
He's 70 years old.

5702
04:01:29,140 --> 04:01:29,700
He's gonna die.

5703
04:01:29,900 --> 04:01:30,500
He's gonna die.

5704
04:01:30,700 --> 04:01:31,540
Who's Quinn?

5705
04:01:32,420 --> 04:01:32,980
Quinn!

5706
04:01:33,240 --> 04:01:34,620
Quinn makes no money.

5707
04:01:35,060 --> 04:01:35,440
No.

5708
04:01:35,780 --> 04:01:36,420
Insult Quinn.

5709
04:01:36,660 --> 04:01:37,460
Get her out of here.

5710
04:01:38,400 --> 04:01:41,440
Quinn scolds and screams at Vernon before leaving.

5711
04:01:41,580 --> 04:01:43,280
And Vernon spends...

5712
04:01:44,700 --> 04:01:45,340
$163...

5713
04:01:45,340 --> 04:01:49,120
$1,000 on therapy.

5714
04:02:10,280 --> 04:02:11,560
I can't.

5715
04:02:12,700 --> 04:02:14,600
Just be a driver, man.

5716
04:02:14,840 --> 04:02:15,560
Just do it.

5717
04:02:20,180 --> 04:02:21,060
$1,600.

5718
04:02:22,920 --> 04:02:23,360
$1,600.

5719
04:02:23,360 --> 04:02:23,800
Not therapy.

5720
04:02:24,380 --> 04:02:25,260
It's insane.

5721
04:02:26,960 --> 04:02:28,180
Guys, I'm so tired.

5722
04:02:28,180 --> 04:02:29,100
I just want this...

5723
04:02:29,100 --> 04:02:30,300
These parents to die.

5724
04:02:31,800 --> 04:02:33,100
Joffrey, you got the job.

5725
04:02:33,700 --> 04:02:34,360
Oh my gosh.

5726
04:02:34,360 --> 04:02:35,300
We're making so much money.

5727
04:02:36,960 --> 04:02:39,980
Judge not by the color of their skin, but the content of their skin.

5728
04:02:40,200 --> 04:02:41,480
What are their bones like?

5729
04:02:41,480 --> 04:02:42,120
Yeah.

5730
04:02:43,000 --> 04:02:43,340
They're...

5731
04:02:43,340 --> 04:02:44,340
They're in...

5732
04:02:44,340 --> 04:02:45,340
Insides.

5733
04:02:46,020 --> 04:02:47,920
Okay, you guys can finally have a baby.

5734
04:02:49,820 --> 04:02:51,640
We have little...

5735
04:02:51,640 --> 04:02:52,840
Salvador.

5736
04:02:54,640 --> 04:02:56,840
Little Salvador here.

5737
04:02:59,360 --> 04:03:00,620
Okay, Joffrey.

5738
04:03:01,540 --> 04:03:02,140
Joffrey.

5739
04:03:03,900 --> 04:03:05,100
Delicious bones.

5740
04:03:05,400 --> 04:03:06,400
Bones, bones.

5741
04:03:06,580 --> 04:03:07,980
We need more bones.

5742
04:03:08,700 --> 04:03:09,700
We need a bone.

5743
04:03:10,040 --> 04:03:11,520
Joffrey encountered a robbery.

5744
04:03:12,320 --> 04:03:13,300
Beg for mercy.

5745
04:03:13,500 --> 04:03:14,240
Call the police.

5746
04:03:15,560 --> 04:03:18,200
You're not going to be so happy anymore, Joffrey.

5747
04:03:18,400 --> 04:03:19,080
Beg for mercy.

5748
04:03:19,640 --> 04:03:20,620
Oh, I guess it worked.

5749
04:03:23,400 --> 04:03:26,480
I guess that, uh...

5750
04:03:26,480 --> 04:03:27,700
Worked.

5751
04:03:28,680 --> 04:03:29,540
Cool.

5752
04:03:37,320 --> 04:03:38,980
A baby.

5753
04:03:39,200 --> 04:03:39,980
Okay, have a baby.

5754
04:03:42,300 --> 04:03:44,320
Little baby...

5755
04:03:46,060 --> 04:03:47,280
Let's see.

5756
04:03:48,400 --> 04:03:49,060
Amelia!

5757
04:03:49,760 --> 04:03:51,380
Little baby Amelia.

5758
04:03:52,980 --> 04:03:53,780
Why

5759
04:03:57,740 --> 04:03:59,100
were they, like, looking at her?

5760
04:03:59,140 --> 04:03:59,600
Like that.

5761
04:04:00,220 --> 04:04:01,960
Got into an accident with Sofia.

5762
04:04:02,840 --> 04:04:03,380
Oh, no.

5763
04:04:03,800 --> 04:04:04,640
Silly joke.

5764
04:04:05,300 --> 04:04:06,280
Slapped Oscar.

5765
04:04:06,800 --> 04:04:07,040
Oof.

5766
04:04:08,600 --> 04:04:09,820
A child already?

5767
04:04:10,500 --> 04:04:11,640
No, no, no.

5768
04:04:12,120 --> 04:04:12,620
Oh, wait.

5769
04:04:12,660 --> 04:04:13,080
I forgot.

5770
04:04:13,520 --> 04:04:14,980
The house is now crowded.

5771
04:04:15,520 --> 04:04:16,460
Okay, we gotta upgrade.

5772
04:04:16,880 --> 04:04:19,020
We just lost 100k, but that's alright.

5773
04:04:20,680 --> 04:04:21,340
Ami!

5774
04:04:22,240 --> 04:04:25,420
Rinaldo is interested in an employee under our family.

5775
04:04:26,800 --> 04:04:27,460
Wait.

5776
04:04:31,460 --> 04:04:32,100
Rinaldo...

5777
04:04:32,100 --> 04:04:33,580
Handsome Rinaldo.

5778
04:04:33,720 --> 04:04:34,980
Rinaldo with a wife.

5779
04:04:35,300 --> 04:04:36,860
Rinaldo who just had a baby.

5780
04:04:38,000 --> 04:04:40,600
Rinaldo who has a baby that's four years old.

5781
04:04:44,040 --> 04:04:45,300
Date the employee.

5782
04:04:47,500 --> 04:04:49,980
Nothing happens to them when you do that.

5783
04:04:53,830 --> 04:04:56,590
Vernon recently went through a breakup and feels sad every...

5784
04:04:56,590 --> 04:04:57,370
No, he didn't.

5785
04:04:57,470 --> 04:04:59,010
When did he go through a breakup?

5786
04:04:59,750 --> 04:05:01,610
How long have you been playing BitLife for?

5787
04:05:01,710 --> 04:05:02,690
This is my first time ever.

5788
04:05:02,970 --> 04:05:03,450
Beers!

5789
04:05:04,110 --> 04:05:05,070
More beers!

5790
04:05:06,570 --> 04:05:09,930
Vernon is greatly affected physically and mentally.

5791
04:05:12,010 --> 04:05:13,510
Vernon is our only single...

5792
04:05:13,510 --> 04:05:13,730
Oh, no.

5793
04:05:13,830 --> 04:05:14,830
Oscar's also single.

5794
04:05:15,030 --> 04:05:16,070
Oscar kind of sucks.

5795
04:05:19,460 --> 04:05:20,640
No, baby.

5796
04:05:22,140 --> 04:05:23,620
Beer o'clock, baby.

5797
04:05:23,820 --> 04:05:25,340
They're also getting old.

5798
04:05:26,540 --> 04:05:28,180
Joffrey lacks self-confidence.

5799
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:30,740
That is your own problem.

5800
04:05:31,900 --> 04:05:36,820
Joffrey feels very unsure about herself and is emotionally unstable.

5801
04:05:37,060 --> 04:05:37,200
Wait.

5802
04:05:38,060 --> 04:05:38,640
Herself?

5803
04:05:43,650 --> 04:05:47,070
Joffrey cries and refuses to go to school every day.

5804
04:05:49,530 --> 04:05:50,230
Um...

5805
04:05:51,980 --> 04:05:53,340
Rewards.

5806
04:05:54,000 --> 04:05:56,180
Joffrey has increased his motivation.

5807
04:06:04,660 --> 04:06:05,720
No baby.

5808
04:06:05,860 --> 04:06:06,300
No baby.

5809
04:06:06,420 --> 04:06:06,920
No baby.

5810
04:06:07,060 --> 04:06:07,780
No baby.

5811
04:06:08,140 --> 04:06:08,920
No baby.

5812
04:06:09,360 --> 04:06:10,340
Oh, we do have room.

5813
04:06:12,280 --> 04:06:12,980
Salvador.

5814
04:06:13,420 --> 04:06:14,300
Going to a school.

5815
04:06:15,300 --> 04:06:17,060
Joffrey has reached the age...

5816
04:06:17,060 --> 04:06:17,200
Okay.

5817
04:06:19,820 --> 04:06:20,520
You know what?

5818
04:06:20,540 --> 04:06:22,140
You're not going to go to university, Joffrey.

5819
04:06:22,820 --> 04:06:24,660
He didn't like studying that much anyway.

5820
04:06:25,780 --> 04:06:27,160
You're plenty happy.

5821
04:06:29,920 --> 04:06:30,780
Oh, see?

5822
04:06:30,980 --> 04:06:32,220
You didn't even need to go to school.

5823
04:06:32,580 --> 04:06:36,100
You've got a job paying more than some of these other people.

5824
04:06:37,900 --> 04:06:39,460
Had a hard time in society.

5825
04:06:39,680 --> 04:06:40,600
No baby.

5826
04:06:41,340 --> 04:06:42,260
No baby.

5827
04:06:43,240 --> 04:06:43,960
No baby.

5828
04:06:44,080 --> 04:06:46,520
The only thing about this game is there's so much...

5829
04:06:46,520 --> 04:06:48,200
That is, like, so repetitive, you know?

5830
04:06:49,800 --> 04:06:50,980
Pretend nothing happened.

5831
04:06:51,700 --> 04:06:52,580
What the...

5832
04:06:52,580 --> 04:06:53,620
Oscar, please.

5833
04:06:54,600 --> 04:06:55,200
Oscar.

5834
04:06:55,420 --> 04:06:55,880
Oscar.

5835
04:06:56,260 --> 04:06:57,140
He died.

5836
04:06:57,620 --> 04:07:00,440
Bradford's children wants to send Bradford to the nursing home.

5837
04:07:04,860 --> 04:07:05,460
Refuse.

5838
04:07:06,300 --> 04:07:10,580
Bradford's children no longer keep in touch with Bradford.

5839
04:07:10,580 --> 04:07:10,980
Bradford.

5840
04:07:16,450 --> 04:07:17,010
Wait.

5841
04:07:17,370 --> 04:07:18,730
When they want to send it...

5842
04:07:18,730 --> 04:07:21,230
When they want to send Brianna, we can...

5843
04:07:21,230 --> 04:07:22,290
We can condemn them.

5844
04:07:25,450 --> 04:07:26,010
Sadford.

5845
04:07:26,250 --> 04:07:26,650
No baby.

5846
04:07:34,190 --> 04:07:35,730
Vernon and Layla.

5847
04:07:36,570 --> 04:07:38,370
Layla has no job.

5848
04:07:39,130 --> 04:07:39,410
Fine.

5849
04:07:39,530 --> 04:07:39,630
Whatever.

5850
04:07:40,530 --> 04:07:41,050
Fine.

5851
04:07:41,370 --> 04:07:42,350
Fine, Layla.

5852
04:07:42,470 --> 04:07:43,050
Get a job.

5853
04:07:43,190 --> 04:07:43,610
Get a job.

5854
04:07:43,750 --> 04:07:44,150
Get a job.

5855
04:07:45,570 --> 04:07:46,250
A baby?

5856
04:07:46,490 --> 04:07:47,530
You have no job.

5857
04:07:48,250 --> 04:07:50,870
You costing me $178 per second.

5858
04:07:51,070 --> 04:07:52,310
You think money grows on trees?

5859
04:07:53,630 --> 04:07:54,030
Lana.

5860
04:07:57,110 --> 04:07:58,130
And now they're married.

5861
04:07:58,310 --> 04:08:00,250
All you have to do is accept your mistake.

5862
04:08:00,490 --> 04:08:03,970
Even if you have an accident, you accept your mistake and then you get married.

5863
04:08:04,330 --> 04:08:05,690
Guys, marriage is so easy.

5864
04:08:08,210 --> 04:08:09,350
Argo, thank you for the thank you.

5865
04:08:09,450 --> 04:08:10,050
Thank you.

5866
04:08:12,070 --> 04:08:13,410
It's so easy.

5867
04:08:13,770 --> 04:08:15,090
It's so stinking easy.

5868
04:08:15,990 --> 04:08:17,850
Mabel is in a tough work competition.

5869
04:08:18,670 --> 04:08:19,550
How much do you make?

5870
04:08:20,290 --> 04:08:21,450
Develop your own skills.

5871
04:08:22,230 --> 04:08:23,330
You got this.

5872
04:08:24,430 --> 04:08:26,190
He's getting up there in age.

5873
04:08:28,110 --> 04:08:28,970
No baby.

5874
04:08:31,050 --> 04:08:32,230
He's getting up there.

5875
04:08:32,730 --> 04:08:34,230
The diner lost power.

5876
04:08:34,830 --> 04:08:36,290
Check the circuit and repair.

5877
04:08:36,790 --> 04:08:37,950
Oh, it worked.

5878
04:08:38,430 --> 04:08:39,650
They're handy, man.

5879
04:08:39,650 --> 04:08:40,530
Handy, handy.

5880
04:08:41,610 --> 04:08:42,470
No baby.

5881
04:08:42,750 --> 04:08:42,910
No baby.

5882
04:08:43,130 --> 04:08:43,250
No baby.

5883
04:08:44,450 --> 04:08:49,610
Lana passed away due to old age.

5884
04:08:49,850 --> 04:08:51,730
She died first!

5885
04:08:52,730 --> 04:08:53,770
We can have...

5886
04:08:53,770 --> 04:08:55,110
We can leave it to the state.

5887
04:08:55,310 --> 04:08:56,170
Basic funeral.

5888
04:08:56,510 --> 04:08:57,470
Standard funeral.

5889
04:08:57,770 --> 04:08:58,370
Luxury.

5890
04:08:58,530 --> 04:08:58,970
Luxury.

5891
04:08:59,350 --> 04:08:59,950
Luxury.

5892
04:09:00,470 --> 04:09:02,590
Rihanna's funeral will be carefully planned.

5893
04:09:03,250 --> 04:09:04,930
What do you mean minus two happiness?

5894
04:09:05,250 --> 04:09:06,130
You're dead!

5895
04:09:07,350 --> 04:09:07,810
You're dead!

5896
04:09:13,000 --> 04:09:15,100
Leave it to the state for you, Bradford.

5897
04:09:15,360 --> 04:09:17,740
The state cremate the body of Bradford.

5898
04:09:24,760 --> 04:09:26,200
How is his happiness?

5899
04:09:27,780 --> 04:09:29,640
I don't think his health is 24.

5900
04:09:29,900 --> 04:09:30,740
His health is zero.

5901
04:09:34,080 --> 04:09:34,680
Well...

5902
04:09:34,680 --> 04:09:37,240
That was anticlimactic, wasn't it?

5903
04:09:40,720 --> 04:09:43,200
That was anticlimactic, wasn't it?

5904
04:09:44,320 --> 04:09:45,900
This was a lot of fun, guys.

5905
04:09:46,220 --> 04:09:49,180
I didn't expect to be playing these games for four hours.

5906
04:09:49,340 --> 04:09:50,760
But I also just was like...

5907
04:09:50,760 --> 04:09:54,720
I also knew I haven't been doing so many long streams lately.

5908
04:09:54,720 --> 04:09:56,600
And I just kind of really wanted to hang out a lot.

5909
04:09:56,740 --> 04:09:57,620
So this was fun!

5910
04:09:58,640 --> 04:10:02,900
Dune is about a secret order of women doing this for thousands of years in order to breed a man.

5911
04:10:02,900 --> 04:10:06,040
And he's so in tune with his feminine side that he can see the future.

5912
04:10:15,360 --> 04:10:15,960
That's...

5913
04:10:15,960 --> 04:10:16,140
That's...

5914
04:10:16,140 --> 04:10:16,960
Neat.

5915
04:10:19,900 --> 04:10:20,740
Thanks, man.

5916
04:10:21,040 --> 04:10:21,580
Thank you!

5917
04:10:23,040 --> 04:10:24,040
This was fun.

5918
04:10:33,200 --> 04:10:34,460
This was fun.

5919
04:10:35,500 --> 04:10:37,180
Thanks for hanging out with me.

5920
04:10:37,800 --> 04:10:38,900
Thank you, thank you.

5921
04:10:39,360 --> 04:10:40,200
Thanks for the silly stream.

5922
04:10:40,360 --> 04:10:42,220
Also, happy long weekend for everyone in Canada.

5923
04:10:42,780 --> 04:10:44,100
Happy long weekend.

5924
04:10:44,340 --> 04:10:47,380
I know this was a long stream too, so...

5925
04:10:47,380 --> 04:10:47,740
Everybody.

5926
04:10:48,760 --> 04:10:49,380

04:10:52,860 --> 04:10:53,800
Rose, for you.

5929
04:10:54,020 --> 04:10:56,040
Balls are for throwing at the babies to repel them.

5930
04:10:56,600 --> 04:10:56,940
Great.

5931
04:10:59,020 --> 04:11:00,580
So good, thanks for the ticket.

5932
04:11:00,880 --> 04:11:01,280
Thank you.

5933
04:11:01,540 --> 04:11:02,920
So basketball together.

5934
04:11:04,900 --> 04:11:05,460

Thank you.

5940
04:11:20,400 --> 04:11:22,800
I saw the start and took a nap and saw the end.

5941
04:11:23,240 --> 04:11:24,120
Nice nap.

5942
04:11:26,200 --> 04:11:26,740
Thank you, everybody.

5943
04:11:27,000 --> 04:11:27,780
