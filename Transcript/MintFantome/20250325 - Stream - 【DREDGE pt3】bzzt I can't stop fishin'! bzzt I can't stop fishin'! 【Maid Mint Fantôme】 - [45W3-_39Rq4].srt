1
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,260
Oh.

2
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,080
Oh.

3
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,150
The...

4
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,470
The main menu changed.

5
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,510
Wow.

6
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,170
Ahoy there, lady.

7
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,670
Welcome back to Trench.

8
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,970
Welcome back.

9
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,730
We're back.

10
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,370
And it's for some reason now says complete edition.

11
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,590
Curious.

12
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,590
Curious.

13
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Hello, everybody.

14
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,520
Welcome back to Trench.

15
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,040
I love fishing, as you can tell from my hat.

16
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,900
I put it like this and I feel like Spongebob.

17
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,580
I feel like...

18
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
How Spongebob has his hat.

19
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,120
Sick hat.

20
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,840
Thanks.

21
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,560
Thanks.

22
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,020
How am I feeling today?

23
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,720
I'm a little...

24
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm a little...

25
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,600
I'm a little okay.

26
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm not so great, I'll be honest.

27
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,540
I just lied to you.

28
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,180
But it's okay.

29
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,220
I'm just fishing.

30
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,080
And I'm eating rice.

31
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,280
Rice.

32
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,130
But I'm excited to fish.

33
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,370
You're as addicted to this game as I am addicted to you.

34
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,850
You like fishing?

35
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,990
Oh my gosh, instead of...

36
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,030
Instead of Barry the Beat going, you like jazz?

37
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,770
He should have said, you like fishing?

38
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,610
I think everybody should like fishing.

39
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,910
What does the hat say?

40
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,190
Women fear me, fish fear me.

41
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,150
Men turn their eyes away from me as I walk.

42
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,770
No beast dare make a sound in my presence.

43
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,370
I am alone on this barren earth.

44
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,900
I have to be extra small today because my head is so big.

45
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,020
Why are you guys blushing?

46
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,520
What are you blushing about?

47
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
Fishing is cute.

48
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,720
Agreed.

49
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,320
Atonement for my sins.

50
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,660
What is this for?

51
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
What did you do?

52
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,740
What did you not do?

53
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,220
What did you do?

54
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,020
I feel like fishing mintos.

55
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,880
Aren't you on vacation?

56
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,920
Go away.

57
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,180
Gargle a lemon.

58
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,500
Thanks for the 10 gift.

59
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,440
Thank you.

60
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,160
I would happily.

61
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,900
I love lemon.

62
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,080
I'll eat a whole lemon.

63
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,860
I'll ask my friends for their lemon.

64
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,640
If they have a lemon, I'll just rip it out and be like...

65
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,660
I'm like that.

66
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,480
I will try sleeping with your stream in the background.

67
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,860
I don't think I'll scream today, so I think you'll be able to sleep.

68
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,780
Thank you for the 20 gift.

69
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,940
Love your minto manga script.

70
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,340
Oh, I think I saw that.

71
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,400
The...

72
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,020
The lewd one.

73
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,420
The one where it's like I am dying.

74
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,540
And Doki is like...

75
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,980
Sad.

76
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,400
Lemon stealing memes?

77
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
I love lemons.

78
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,320
I can't help it.

79
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,720
I don't steal.

80
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
I always ask.

81
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,140
I say, hey, are you going to eat your lemon?

82
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
Hey, are you going to eat that?

83
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,380
Hey, are you going to use that?

84
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,400
Are you going to use your lemon?

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,060
Well, even if they use it, I'll still eat it.

86
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,010
My girlfriend and I started reading Morning Glory.

87
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,470
And it's great.

88
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,810
Violet is a lucky girl.

89
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,730
Thanks for the recommendation.

90
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,230
Oh my gosh.

91
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,670
Couples activity.

92
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,110
Wait.

93
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,290
I think there was a new one that I was going to start last night and I fell asleep.

94
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,970
Hold on.

95
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,530
What's my... What's my... Oh, this is the app.

96
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:46,930
Hold on.

97
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,530
I have a new book that I might be starting.

98
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,970
The Orc Boss.

99
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,270
Oh, how am I 60% of the way through this book?

100
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,430
What?

101
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,440
60% of the book complete.

102
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,680
When?

103
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,120
Huh?

104
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,060
Let me read you the...

105
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,460
This is the synopsis.

106
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,140
Oh my God, it's long.

107
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,400
Okay.

108
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,320
Sky knows the only way to get over her ex is to get under someone new.

109
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,400
But what if that someone is an Orc Mafia...

110
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,840
An Orc Mafia boss.

111
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,050
Sky Brooks is an independent fae living in a modern world.

112
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,010
Though her culture's old-fashioned beliefs...

113
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,670
Wait.

114
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,470
Though her culture's old-fashioned beliefs insist she get married and have lots of babies.

115
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,430
A.S.A.P.

116
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,620
What is this fairy lore that I never knew about?

117
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:27,110
As much as Sky tries to follow tradition, she's just trying to have lots of babies, you guys.

118
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,450
She is unceremoniously dumped by her boyfriend after a decade together.

119
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,690
To add insult to injury, his booty calls keep coming in and Sky answers...

120
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,410
Oh, I do remember that.

121
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,490
That's the beginning of the book.

122
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,110
Oh my gosh.

123
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,870
I do.

124
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,130
Oh, I guess I did start this before.

125
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:52,750
Oh yeah, he booty calls her and she's just like, I'm back at my boyfriend's or my ex-boyfriend's house.

126
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,350
Sky answers every time.

127
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:02,470
To break this toxic cycle, she knows her only option to get over her ex is to get under someone new.

128
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,410
Ansel Walsh is an orc mobster on a mission.

129
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,650
Avenge his parents' death.

130
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,370
Gosh, there's a lot going on here.

131
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,990
He spends every waking moment dismantling his uncle's criminal business.

132
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,150
I don't think he has time for babies, though.

133
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,730
Thank you for the gifted.

134
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,040
Walsh.

135
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,580
No, his name is Ansel.

136
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,980
A-N-S-E-L.

137
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,640
Ansel the orc.

138
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,260
Please start a book club, I beg.

139
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,760
No!

140
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:56,900
One night, while hunting his uncle's cronies, he inadvertently takes the place of Sky's back alley hookup.

141
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,500
Whoa!

142
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,620
That's not a boy whose parents would be so disappointed.

143
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,420
One handsy interaction later... I must have fallen asleep before all of this happened.

144
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,960
Ansel's secret...

145
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,540
One handsy interaction later, she becomes his unwilling captive.

146
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,140
Whoa!

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,780
I thought she was trying to get a boyfriend.

148
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,860
Ansel... I can't get over this name.

149
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,160
Swears he's only kidnapping Sky to keep her safe.

150
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,030
It's a protective kidnapping.

151
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,270
Please understand.

152
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,750
But when she wakes to find herself handcuffed to his bed, she feels a lot of things.

153
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,470
Safe isn't one of them.

154
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,330
I'm in tears.

155
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,370
I'll let you know how this one goes, guys.

156
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,210
I'll start it tonight and I'll actually pay attention.

157
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,090
Yeah, we need updates?

158
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,390
Okay.

159
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:21,550
Okay.

160
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,530
Okay.

161
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,870
Okay.

162
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,350
I got you.

163
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,750
Anyway, shall we dredge?

164
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,740
When does the minotaur show up?

165
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,660
I don't know.

166
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,560
Who's in this?

167
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,700
Happy fishing.

168
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,360
Thank you!

169
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,780
Book report.

170
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,740
I do that, like, every couple of streams.

171
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,820
That Among Us collab looks super stacked.

172
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,560
Hope you have lots of fun.

173
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,600
Thank you!

174
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,940
I'm nervous about all my collabs this week.

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,340
Shall we dredge?

176
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,300
Am I meant to go block today?

177
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,300
Somehow my plushie, even though I ordered from the second batch...

178
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,440
Oh!

179
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,400
I hope I didn't get someone else's order.

180
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,680
Maybe I got lucky.

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,520
Congrats?

182
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,840
Thank you.

183
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,680
So last time, we have new quests.

184
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,280
We gotta go to the Twisted Strand.

185
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,660
This must be DLC.

186
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,240
I was not there.

187
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,520
Oh!

188
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:38,880
Oh!

189
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,240
What the heck is this?

190
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,180
It's your two boyanos.

191
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,580
Welcome to Bamboo Ship.

192
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,880
Giant red circle.

193
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,300
There's no other ones.

194
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,120
Let's go to the big red circle.

195
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
What time is it?

196
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,620
Oh, it's kind of late.

197
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,900
I think I sold everything.

198
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,540
I'll repair since we're here.

200
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,500
Oops, wrong thing.

201
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,260
A lot of people are getting their Mint merch, it seems today, because I've seen a lot of posts about it.

202
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,580
Everybody is posting really funny things.

203
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,360
Thank you everybody for all the orders.

204
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,340
Thank you.

205
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,540
Research farming?

206
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,620
There's no farming.

207
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,660
What are you talking about?

208
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,220
Sorry, I'm still eating my rice.

209
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,380
I'm almost done.

210
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,520
Daimu!

211
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,740
Daimu!

212
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,040
I love this game.

213
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,720
I'm so obsessed.

214
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,800
Freaky way to start my morning.

215
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,440
Michael Smeltos?

216
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,540
What the heck is that?

217
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,240
I can't really do anything.

218
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,180
I guess we'll just fish until nighttime and then we'll make the big journey to...

219
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,120
Um...

220
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,380
To...

221
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,760
What's it called?

222
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,360
It's that direction, I believe.

223
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,780
What fish have we not gotten in this area?

224
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,400
Let's see.

225
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,300
Encyclopedia.

226
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,580
Where are the ste... No, Gale Cliffs.

227
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,620
Ooh, fancy.

228
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,180
This?

229
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,100
Oceanic?

230
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,640
Only at night.

231
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,800
Shallow, the sky.

232
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,120
What?

233
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,580
What?

234
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,460
Minto chat is so nice.

235
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,740
I love you, Daimu!

236
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,820
I love you, Daimu!

237
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,360
Oh yeah, there's 230 fish now.

238
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,020
Oh my gosh.

239
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,260
Wait, are these new fish?

240
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,540
Wait, why are they golden?

241
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,400
Uh-oh.

242
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,440
Maybe I bought things and, um...

243
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,940
I bought the DLC and now everything is like, expanded like crazy.

244
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,460
Everything's in the 5 gift set.

245
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,700
I

246
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,600
might start doing the wrench thing again.

247
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,980
What's that sound?

248
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,360
Daimu, would you be the honors of my first wrench since I've been back?

249
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,900
I think it'd be like, maybe it'd be easier to see people.

250
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,060
I use the YTC chat too.

251
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,980
I just...

252
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,760
Um...

253
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,180
Add.

254
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,020
I didn't... I didn't want to make anyone feel pressure with it, but...

255
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,740
Yes, I will do that.

256
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,440
What does that mean?

257
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
Don't worry about it.

258
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,180
No pressure.

259
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,660
Do you think that guy is going to come out?

260
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,880
And eat me?

261
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,440
Wait!

262
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
This is the thing that I was like...

263
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
Oh, I don't have this guy.

264
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,580
We literally found him just now.

265
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,640
What is this?

266
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,700
A wreck fish.

267
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,620
Who hurt you?

268
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,740
Uh-oh.

269
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,580
It's nighttime.

270
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,080
I can't see anything.

271
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,180
I got a devil ray.

272
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,020
Giving moderation powers to someone who has no clue how YouTube...

273
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,420
No!

274
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,360
It's like...

275
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,860
It's like the special...

276
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,240
It's like...

277
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,620
It's like...

278
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,200
What's this?

279
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,820
Oh yeah, the stone.

280
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,680
It doesn't respond to my touch.

281
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,720
I don't have the special touch.

282
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,740
It's like a VIP on Twitch.

283
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,540
Right guys?

284
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,120
Ouch!

285
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,960
Don't worry.

286
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,960
We are OK.

287
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,700
You gelatinous...

288
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,320
I lost my fish!

289
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,400
I lost my wreck fish.

290
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,060
At least we got him, right?

291
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
So that I could...

292
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:51,990
What's that sound?

293
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,370
Uh-oh.

294
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,410
Guys, I think something is coming after me.

295
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,750
What's that noise?

296
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,950
What's coming after me?

297
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,850
I'm curious.

298
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,070
Let's fix our boat.

299
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,850
OK.

300
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,150
Alright.

301
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,290
It's fine.

302
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,600
So...

303
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,190
I do want to point out...

304
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,210
I did buy the DLC.

305
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,190
Wait, what happened?

306
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,200
We back?

307
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,580
What happened?

308
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,040
YouTube is very strange.

309
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,100
It's not my end because...

310
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
My thing is fine.

311
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,560
What I was saying...

312
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
I don't know how much of it I'll do.

313
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,260
For the DLC.

314
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,120
Just kind of know that like...

315
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,740
People said it has cool upgrades and things like that.

316
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,520
So...

317
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,620
Oops, sorry.

318
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,120
We're going this way.

319
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,260
Trying to figure out how memberships work and thought I broke something.

320
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,980
You might have, that's OK.

321
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,320
OK.

322
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,020
We're on the right track.

323
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,820
Limus, stop it.

324
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,700
Why are you joining membership?

325
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,220
Stop!

326
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,710
Yo-ho, yo-ho.

327
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,610
We're going out to sea.

328
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,030
Let's go see what it is.

329
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:35,610
I found a white and mint colored...

330
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,870
Golf ball yesterday.

331
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,630
And lost it three strokes and...

332
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,810
Unlucky.

333
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,370
Dang, this thing is far.

334
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:51,990
Are we almost there?

335
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,840
Is that it?

336
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,420
The island?

337
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,520
I don't know what we're heading out to.

338
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,220
We're almost there.

339
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,180
That's...

340
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,020
An island.

341
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,720
I thought that was another boat for a second.

342
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,880
Wait, what?

343
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,110
Honestly, I have no idea what the DLC is.

344
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:42,970
I just got it.

345
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,470
It's icy.

346
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,550
We're in Antarctica.

347
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,730
It's getting night.

348
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,990
It's getting dark.

349
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,830
What's this right here?

350
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,810
Is this a dock?

351
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,310
Or that's a...

352
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,130
That's that.

353
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,510
What is this?

354
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,310
A shipwreck?

355
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,170
This is a man!

356
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,910
Oh, it's the hooded man!

357
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,650
Thank you for your dredge streams.

358
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,070
These have been really fun and cozy.

359
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:20,950
I got it.

360
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,670
So I can play along and he's gonna lurk and work with it.

361
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,230
Good fishing.

362
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,210
Thanks Fallen!

363
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,670
Thank you so much for the super chat.

364
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,150
The ice.

365
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,890
We hear their jaws snap shut again from the cold.

366
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,750
The ice takes form.

367
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,770
A type ice?

368
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:38,670
Oh my gosh.

369
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,150
He's an aberrated...

370
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,970
This guy is asking for a lot.

371
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,930
Can I squeeze through there?

372
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,870
I don't think I should.

373
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,810
I think I should find...

374
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,470
Shelter?

375
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,310
Or something.

376
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,410
I think I'm gonna die out here, honestly.

377
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,550
I might die out here.

378
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,410
Hello?

379
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,530
Anyone alive out here?

380
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,950
It's kinda spooky.

381
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:20,730
No.

382
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,490
Wait.

383
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,290
I thought I saw light.

384
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,070
Is that light?

385
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:25,850
What is that?

386
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,930
Land?

387
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,030
No!

388
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,200
It is.

389
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,120
It is light.

390
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,240
What's happening?

391
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,100
Something spooky is here.

392
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,520
I'm getting... I'm getting cursed.

393
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,960
What's happening?

394
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,580
I'm scared.

395
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,900
I see eyeballs.

396
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,880
Nah, it was nothing.

397
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,760
Must have been the wind.

398
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:00,820
Wind.

399
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,070
Excuse me.

400
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,330
Leave me alone.

401
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,250
Check the map.

402
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,810
I'm like... I'm barely inside.

403
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,350
I've just been going along the edge.

404
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,100
That looks like...

405
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,860
Oh, I see the lighthouse even from here.

406
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,700
That is probably a spooky guy, no?

407
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,240
He's gonna come alive and...

408
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,220
Try and grab me?

409
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,280
Probably.

410
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,080
I'm in the mist!

411
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,640
Is this thing still chasing after me?

412
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,100
It is.

413
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,370
I hear it still.

414
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,330
I hear it coming after me.

415
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,920
What is that?

416
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,980
How do I get in there?

417
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,560
Oh my goodness.

418
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,480
The sun is rising.

419
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,740
Thank you.

420
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,940
Just a normal, normal water spout.

421
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,060
Hello.

422
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,360
So evil.

423
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,920
Thank you.

424
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,420
Is this also evil?

425
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,780
Or...

426
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,260
Oh, the stone trembles before you.

427
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,780
Unknown symbols glow from within.

428
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,260
A sudden...

429
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,440
This stone I can touch!

430
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,620
A sudden chill rushes through the marrow of your bones, surging up your arm, your neck.

431
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,100
A deep vision enters your mind.

432
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,380
Intruders.

433
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,660
They invade on tiny wooden vessels, shouting and smelling.

434
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,300
They cut and slice with angled metal, breaking across a skin of ice.

435
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,780
Their meager hearts beat with... rice.

436
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,240
And pride!

437
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,840
Desires trivially twisted into new shapes.

438
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,920
Shapes that might mend and restore.

439
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,400
Shapes to replace what was lost down in the dark.

440
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,120
Hole?

441
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,580
What does that mean?

442
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,120
How do I get inside?

443
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,620
I love rice.

444
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,400
I'm eating rice right now.

445
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,570
What the?

446
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,230
Did you guys see that?

447
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,870
That don't look good.

448
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:03,790
Me next?

449
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,510
Okay, maybe I can get in.

450
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,950
I have to be very...

451
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,570
Something's crackling.

452
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,330
I have to be really careful.

453
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,510
Do I need C4, maybe?

454
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,100
It's crackling.

455
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,860
That was awesome, yeah.

456
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,080
Hello?

457
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,940
I'm not gonna take this right now, because...

458
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,840
A lot of crackling noise.

459
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,760
Because I don't know what will happen to us, you know?

460
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,800
Crunchy.

461
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,560
Go away, water spout.

462
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,690
Is he home?

463
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,670
Maybe that one way was my way through.

464
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,180
Can I fish here?

465
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,300
Oh, I see.

466
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,220
I do need ice.

467
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,340
Ice breaking ASMR.

468
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,460
Sounds nice.

469
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,620
I'm still a little freaked out.

470
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,640
You can kinda see my sanity took a bit of a hit.

471
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,740
Unlucky my soul.

472
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,280
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

473
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,580
Thank you!

474
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,920
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

475
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,740
This is probably like...

476
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,080
You need to break it up.

477
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:32,700
No?

478
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,120
How do I get through?

479
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,240
You want to offer your what?

480
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,580
Oh, super chat.

481
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,060
This is my first time.

482
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,900
I hope you can be gentle with me.

483
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,040
Today is my birthday.

484
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,000
Can I ask for a happy birthday, please?

485
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,080
Of course!

486
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,600
Happy birthday to you!

487
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,700
Happy birthday to you!

488
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,800
Happy birthday dear Sotomi!

489
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,520
Happy birthday to you!

490
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,960
Happy birthday!

491
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,260
Thank you.

492
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,520
If I crash into this...

493
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,460
Oops.

494
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,280
Okay.

495
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,980
It was for science.

496
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,360
How do I get in?

497
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,960
There's no prompt for like...

498
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,510
There's also like a glowing light back there.

499
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,250
It's very faint.

500
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,450
I don't know if you guys can see it.

501
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,270
Wait!

502
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,070
There's sea machinery over here!

503
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,800
Where were you before?

504
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,660
I guess we can go in from here.

505
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,580
Maybe?

506
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,160
No?

507
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,520
Everything is blocked off.

508
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,400
No, it's not the lighthouse.

509
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,260
I saw a much thinner line.

510
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,700
Down here to investigate the ice field too?

511
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,380
It seems to have appeared out of nowhere.

512
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,800
My best guess is that it drifted from up the south.

513
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,780
Either way, I thought I should set up a pontoon here.

514
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,520
But when I went to stake my claim, I noticed some old equipment on the ice.

515
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,420
Come and check it out when you got a second.

516
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,580
In the meantime, I've got some new rods for sale.

517
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,240
They'll be perfect for fishing in the ice around here.

518
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,520
Icy workshop, yeah.

519
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,680
Oh, it's so weird.

520
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
This stuff seems old.

521
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Like really old.

522
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,740
She kicks a large sheet of metal, half embedded in the ice.

523
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,280
A thin layer of snow dislodges, revealing lines of rivet holes.

524
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,180
Come in here, look!

525
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,000
We follow her into a small makeshift shelter.

526
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,370
Ruined by years of harsh weather.

527
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,850
Inside are some schematics nailed to a table, still barely legible.

528
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,470
This reminds me of when I was in Antarctica.

529
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:21,470
I got to go into a research base that was from like the early 1900s.

530
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,470
And in the bathrooms...

531
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,810
In the bathroom?

532
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,690
Bathrooms.

533
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,770
In the one bathroom, in the bathroom, they had like pin-up girls on the walls.

534
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,470
And I was like...

535
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:43,290
I guess we're, you know, we're lonely in the Antarctic.

536
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,490
And they were sexy.

537
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,910
But yeah, everything is still really well preserved in it because it's so cold, right?

538
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,730
And...

539
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,570
You got to visit Antarctica?

540
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,430
Yeah, I did.

541
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,470
I got to go to Antarctica and...

542
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,770
I got to have a really fun time.

543
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,190
I might be the first Vtuber to go to Antarctica.

544
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,810
Fun.

545
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,710
You follow her into a small makeshift shelter.

546
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,630
Oh, inside there are some schematics.

547
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,950
See how they angled these sheets and the lining of the metal around the bowl?

549
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,510
Whoever was here, I think they were constructing an icebreaker.

550
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,670
Would you make another one using these plans?

551
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:31,650
Probably.

552
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,730
But let me see.

553
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,210
She trudges outside again and paces out the length of the metal scraps on the ice.

554
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,150
We've got most of the basic materials here already, but of course we're missing the most crucial pieces.

555
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,030
Antarctica stream win?

556
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,630
Actually, I wanted to.

557
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,210
If I ever go back, I'll be the first Vtuber to stream in Antarctica.

558
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,950
It was expensive though, so I probably won't be back.

559
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,390
It was kind of a once-in-an-after-lifetime experience, maybe.

560
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:19,190
An icebreaker needs specially tempered angled metal, as well as components designed to minimize the impact to your hull.

561
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,530
I can't see any of those here, but whoever left all this stuff, maybe they left other pieces elsewhere.

562
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,990
Or maybe you'll be able to find their old ship and salvage the icebreaker they already built.

563
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,190
That would be convenient.

564
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,490
Anyway, let's build a new icebreaker.

565
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,550
What are these?

566
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,030
These are the parts we'll need.

567
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,250
Ma'am, I've never seen that ever.

568
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,880
What's the new one?

569
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,120
Oh, the Pale Reach.

570
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,340
Oh, and the Iron Rig.

571
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,120
Oh, these are the things I bought.

572
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,680
I was like, Dredge DLC pays money.

573
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,760
Did I read it?

574
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,360
No.

575
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:11,840
Wow.

576
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,230
Anyway, I ran into some ice, thinking that I could break it, you know?

577
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,490
You should really be more careful.

578
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,010
Sorry.

579
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,750
Sorry, ma'am.

580
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,890
Barbed ice rod...

581
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:30,870
Interesting,

582
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,490
interesting.

583
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,850
So we didn't have to research that.

584
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,630
That's kind of nice.

585
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,430
Breeding is for nerds.

586
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,910
Oh, we have an ice troll net too.

587
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,410
Giant.

588
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,670
Giant light.

589
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,510
I don't think I can do the explosives.

590
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,390
I wonder if there's anything new, new research stuff that we can get.

591
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,310
That's all the same.

592
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,750
This is all the same.

593
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,970
These are all the same.

594
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,150
Same.

595
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,690
Gonna need a bigger boat.

596
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,470
This is all the same.

597
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,700
Such a... shanty.

598
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,020
To honor such day.

599
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,800
Oh, it's your birthday.

600
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Happy time.

601
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,500
Happy... day on the sea.

602
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,800
Oh, the sea.

603
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,940
Superliminal, it's your birthday.

604
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,700
Alright.

605
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,920
Happy birthday.

606
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,640
Not your best work Meantime.

607
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,560
What are you talking about?

608
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,520
I think it was probably the greatest.

609
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,700
Did I, did I repair?

610
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,080
No, I did not.

611
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,680
Oh, it's expensive this time.

612
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,190
Well, at least we sell our fish and it costs... We got our money back.

613
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,670
Geneva, thanks for 11 months.

614
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,730
Thank you.

615
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:57,950
Oh, let's rest.

616
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,670
Beautiful.

617
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,250
Thank you, Pinto.

618
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,170
Of course!

619
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,030
That was a good song.

620
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,920
The music is crazy right now.

621
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,700
I don't think, I don't know if I can go in here.

622
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,420
Let's try it though.

623
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,600
Of course we can try.

624
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,220
Oh, it's kind of spooky.

625
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,540
It's kind of scary.

626
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't think I can fish here.

627
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,370
Rocks everywhere.

628
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,130
Oh, tiny boat.

629
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,030
What are you doing in there?

630
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,440
Tiny boat.

631
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,820
The photographer?

632
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,020
Fisherman, I didn't expect to see you this far south.

633
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,220
Well, this is a fortunate turn of events.

634
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,160
There's a narwhal somewhere in this ice field.

635
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,920
I couldn't get any further in, so I've been trying to take a picture from here with no luck.

636
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,820
I tried placing some scraps of fish on that ice sheet over there to entice it, but I didn't have enough to hold its attention for long enough.

637
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,140
I only caught a glimpse.

638
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,700
Don't suppose you have any fish you'd prepare to donate to the pursuit of wildlife photography?

639
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,460
Okay, fill the space entirely with any fish you'd like.

640
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,340
I can't imagine the narwhal is too picky.

641
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,780
Alright.

642
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,820
Narwhal.

643
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:36,940
Interesting.

644
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,920
Oh, we definitely gotta get some ice stuff.

645
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,520
The

646
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,780
boat goes bento.

647
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,200
Welcome back, all men.

648
00:41:59,260 --> 00:41:59,840
Thank you.

649
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,180
Oh, see, see?

650
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,220
That light.

651
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,760
Oh wait, that's probably... this.

652
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,680
The iron rig.

653
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,260
Let's go check it out.

654
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,780
Let's get out of the ocean.

655
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,500
Not the ocean, the ice.

656
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,270
Oh, Christmas.

657
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,230
Sounds like Christmas music.

658
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,690
How are there palm trees?

659
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,540
Where are we anyway?

660
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,260
Okay, so we definitely gotta get to the twisted strand.

661
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,540
I guess we'll head that way, huh?

662
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:49,400
On our way to the light.

663
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,900
What is this?

664
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,860
Is this wood?

665
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,180
What?

666
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,280
What is this?

667
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,560
Iron Haven crate?

668
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,920
DLC box.

669
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,740
Whoa!

670
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,240
Time to go check it out.

671
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,760
Check it out, check it out.

672
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,600
Check it out, very useful DLC box.

673
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,980
Good to know, good to know.

674
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,220
Today?

675
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:34,750
One moment please.

676
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:39,250
It's gonna be dark after I fish this, but that's okay.

677
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,190
This is the ghost.

678
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,130
The ghost shark is good money, no?

679
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,880
Ghost.

680
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,080
Oh, more?

681
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,040
I guess I sell... you could say I sell... I'm worthless.

682
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,540
Or priceless.

683
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,160
No, worth a lot of money.

684
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,560
Wait, what's the saying?

685
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,800
I got my myth plush in Magnus today.

686
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,900
Have you seen the anime film Belle?

687
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,620
If not, may I suggest a membose?

688
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,780
I haven't seen it.

689
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,850
Spooky mist.

690
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,450
Spooky boat.

691
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,010
There's so many lights now, everywhere.

692
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,510
Don't go to the boat.

693
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,150
He doesn't see me, right?

694
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,330
You don't see me, right mister?

695
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,340
What are those?

696
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,000
What's these lights?

697
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:54,800
These fish?

698
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,020
Spooky boat.

699
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,770
How do I get inside?

700
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,910
I can't tell which direction I'm coming in from.

701
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,390
Oh, I can tell which direction I'm coming in from.

702
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,570
Hello home.

703
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,550
Wow, it's so weird seeing this in the distance, right?

704
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,480
The boat you noticed yesterday?

705
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,120
The DLC reused them for box locations.

706
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,440
Hello.

707
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,320
I like to sell.

708
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,260
Alright, nice.

709
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,360
Um...

710
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,940
Maybe I should've probably bought some stuff.

711
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,980
Should've bought some research things maybe.

712
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,660
That's okay.

713
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,740
I wasn't quite ready to get the ice stuff or do any of the ice stuff just yet.

714
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,140
If I do the light upgrade...

715
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,220
This one, plus one light space.

716
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,540
Even that, how are we supposed to get that big ol' big guy?

717
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,660
Read the box?

718
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,440
Can I open it?

719
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,360
It's full of materials.

720
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,890
Sleep, and then we'll go to the iron...

721
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,110
The new place.

722
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,550
And then...

723
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:52,870
The

724
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,020
world's flimsiest boat.

725
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,320
I have the world's flimsiest boat.

726
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,040
I even sighed.

727
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,080
I even did a sigh of relief.

728
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,420
I was like...

729
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,140
Just barely missed it.

730
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,770
This game...

731
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,530
Oh, we're going to Mother Base!

732
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,730
Built with flex tape.

733
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,010
I've never been in an accident phantom, y'all.

734
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,350
I have it!

735
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,930
With my car!

736
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,630
I'm not boat licensed.

737
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,850
You can't trust me on the seas.

738
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,600
Oh, we finished our book!

739
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,500
Advanced Fishing.

740
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,600
What did I get?

741
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,430
Make a pile of fish.

742
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,310
Oh, I was like, what the hell are you talking about?

743
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,250
Advanced Fishing.

744
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,530
Fishing rods will reel 15% more effectively.

745
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,110
Yippee!

746
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,170
She really is Spongebob.

747
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,130
Maybe.

748
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:31,650
MSF!

749
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,490
It's Mother Base, everybody!

750
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,420
What's here?

751
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,820
What could be here that we have DLC for?

752
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,900
Can I dock here?

753
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,360
This looks like a dock.

754
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:04,600
You dock in a small metal wharf.

755
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,340
Four giant legs stretch down into the deep, lifting a mountain of metal into the sky.

756
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,680
Oh my gosh, you know what's so fascinating and terrifying is like watching...

757
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,560
I've watched like some...

758
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,460
I say documentaries, but it's like documentary style, you know?

759
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,100
It's not like a full documentary.

760
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,460
But just about the people that like build these types of things.

761
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,400
It's scary.

762
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,580
That book seems less than interesting.

763
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,260
Where is the vengeful lord?

764
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,320
So true.

765
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,700
Those types of jobs are so scary.

766
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,520
Is it that dangerous?

767
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,180
Yes!

768
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,140
Oh my gosh, it's really dangerous.

769
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,320
Super bear hero, welcome to membership!

770
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,220
Thank you!

771
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,380
You dock...

772
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,400
Cargo elevator.

773
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,080
Oh, we're going in.

774
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,400
An elevator connecting the docking area to the main platform lies ahead.

775
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,220
A man waits nearby, a yellow hard hat strapped to a concerned expression.

776
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,040
What do you want?

777
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,120
Who are you?

778
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm the site foreman, and this is the Iron Haven Corporation's new drilling rig.

779
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,060
Or it would be.

780
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,320
If we were on schedule, right now it's just a platform.

781
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,740
It's Wario.

782
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:29,160
The boss is gonna dock our pay for sure if he shows up and the drill hasn't even started.

783
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:37,080
We've got the foundational stuff laid, but we've been running into some supply issues.

784
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,280
He glances nervously at the water, large waves rolling underneath the shadow of the platform.

785
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,620
The ships delivering crates of materials keep going missing.

786
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,280
An HQ said they're not able to dispatch anymore for a few weeks.

787
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,640
Look, I wouldn't normally ask a civilian for help, but we're already so far behind.

788
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,400
Why don't I mark the last known coordinates of those ships on your map?

789
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,780
Oh, I've gotten them.

790
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,400
If you're able to find any of those crates, I'm sure the corp...

791
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,300
I found both of them.

792
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,940
Wait, do you have a...

793
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,620
There you go.

794
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,800
Easiest mission ever.

795
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,440
That ought to be enough to get the generator going.

796
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,400
I'll get these materials sent up to the main platform.

797
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,100
Wow, they're efficient.

798
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:37,120
So that should be in working order, but I just checked the storeroom and it looks like we've never got any fuel deliveries.

799
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,120
I did find this though.

800
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,080
You can use it to patch things up in a pinch.

801
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,320
Oh, keep it.

802
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,300
It's the least I can do in return for your help.

803
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,540
While I go and figure out the fuel situation, why don't you introduce yourself to the head scientist?

804
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,220
Oh my gosh, we've got Revolver Ocelot and we're gonna go talk to Otacon.

805
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,320
He's always interested to hear about the local fish species.

806
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,080
Science lab.

807
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,780
Otacon's looking rough.

808
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,200
Huey?

809
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,720
Don't mention his name.

810
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,560
More like Huey.

811
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,720
That guy's no scientist.

812
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,240
That guy's a fraud.

813
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,080
He literally said he stole the... Anyway.

814
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,840
You approach an old man pacing back and forth.

815
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,620
Definitely couldn't be Huey then.

816
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,540
Near a poor known off area on the main platform.

817
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,500
He's muttering to himself quietly.

818
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,740
Who are you?

819
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,740
Ah, the angler turned courier.

820
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,860
Isn't that right?

821
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,740
The workers were talking about you.

822
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,320
All good things, I promise.

823
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,700
Say, you must know a great deal about the fish species around here, yes?

824
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,740
Have you encountered in these waters?

825
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,960
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

826
00:52:53,860 --> 00:53:01,500
Instead of rolling his eyes as most people do when they sense a fisherman's tail approaching, the scientist's eyes glisten with an intense curiosity.

827
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,200
Is that so?

828
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,560
Perhaps he'll find me a little more imaginative than others.

829
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:16,300
Before we get into all that though, it seems my laboratory is also a victim of a missing supply shipment.

830
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,560
I was planning on conducting research into fish species in the area, but I can't do that without somewhere to study.

831
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,620
Do we have that on the map?

832
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,740
Oh, look at that.

833
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,340
They're all like... It's very close.

834
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,790
Wait, which way am I facing?

835
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,570
Is it this way?

836
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,150
This way?

837
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:48,770
Right here?

838
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:51,250
Yeah.

839
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,070
Where's signs?

840
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,020
I didn't even need to put a marker.

841
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,580
It was literally two feet away.

842
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:05,600
Okay.

843
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,490
Wow.

844
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,230
Yikes.

845
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,830
Wait, is this another one?

846
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:25,630
Oh my goodness.

847
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,150
Strand-type island is here too.

848
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:29,830
Yeah, I know.

849
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,070
We're right next to it.

850
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,070
So I was gonna go deliver this and then...

851
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,470
Oh, there's more?

852
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm scared of what creatures are around here.

853
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,400
Not gonna lie.

854
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,120
Mist be gone.

855
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,200
Mist be gone.

856
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,460
Mist be gone.

857
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,740
Mist be gone.

858
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,140
Mist be gone.

859
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,960
Mist be gone.

860
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,680
It worked.

861
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,600
No, it didn't work.

862
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,620
Nevermind, the mist is literally on the ship.

863
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,180
I'm docking.

864
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:13,740
Leave me alone.

865
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,120
Okay, bye.

866
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,200
No, you're mist fish.

867
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,520
It's different.

868
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,660
The detail with the sunken ship is awesome.

869
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,700
You would think that they would notice.

870
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,500
You know?

871
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,740
They would be like...

872
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,700
There's that guy over there.

873
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,440
Oh, we've got enough material for the science lab now too.

874
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,400
We'll get to work.

875
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,260
We're really constructing another base.

876
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,380
That should be enough space for your tubes and fluids, eh?

877
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,860
Why do you guys say it like that?

878
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,440
Curious.

879
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,880
Phrasing, for sure.

880
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,400
I got some tea.

881
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,500
Let's look at the generator and I'll give you the rundown.

882
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,260
So it turns out the fuel never got dispatched from Iron Haven at all.

883
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,900
I was on the radio to HQ.

884
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,460
Apparently this is a biofuel generator.

885
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:51,160
It's some new tech the corp wanted to trial out here.

886
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,340
And they expected us to supply it ourselves.

887
00:56:54,780 --> 00:57:00,580
Thing is, they didn't think to outfit us with any gear for harvesting biomass.

888
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,540
And the fleet services construction is way down on the project list.

889
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,800
We have science tea.

890
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,260
You think you can help us out again?

891
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:15,760
You can add fish or other biological material, I suppose, to the hopper here.

892
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,440
Once it's filled we ought to be able to start the drill.

893
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,160
Oh, look at that.

894
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,660
This might be perfect actually.

895
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,260
Do you think I have enough lobster?

896
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:26,860
Prawn?

897
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,920
Not enough prawn.

898
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,410
Dang, so close.

899
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,830
So close.

900
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:40,570
Let's just sleep.

901
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,350
What's the science lab doing?

902
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,190
How can I help you?

903
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,330
Oh, how long have you worked for the Iron Haven corporation?

904
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:52,990
Oh, Panko!

905
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,750
Thank you so much for the raid!

906
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,070
Hello, hello everybody.

907
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:58,390
Raymac, thanks for the 5 gifted.

908
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,650
We're playing Dredge.

909
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,410
I recently got the DLC and by recently I mean today.

910
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,410
But I'm obsessed with this game.

911
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,310
Panko, if you haven't played this game before, it's so fun.

912
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:10,630
It's so chill.

913
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:11,290
Paperbugs!

914
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,430
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

915
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:14,750
Thank you!

916
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:17,690
Furby, thank you for the 5 gifted.

917
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,330
Hello, hello everybody.

918
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,730
Welcome.

919
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:21,650
Welcome.

920
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,430
Shishi, thanks for the 5 gifted.

921
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,170
RugbyRubber, thanks for the 5 gifted.

922
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,150
Yeah, we're fishing.

923
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,630
We're fishing today.

924
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,610
Bearly, thanks for the 5 gifted.

925
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,530
Just came here and got gifted already.

926
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,970
Lucky, ducky.

927
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:37,810
Never heard of it?

928
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:38,730
It's so fun.

929
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,810
We're just...we're fishing.

930
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,670
And some fish are kinda creepy.

931
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:44,830
Actually, no.

932
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,590
Every fish is beautiful in its own way.

933
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,670
RustyNail, thanks for the 5 gifted.

934
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,190
Tizz himself, thanks for the 5 gifted.

935
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,630
There like might be a cult.

936
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:54,510
Maybe.

937
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,530
There might be like some otherworldly things happening.

938
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,370
It's NBT, no big deal.

939
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,490
Duargo, thank you for the 5 gifted.

940
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,250
My whole professional career has been dedicated to scientific research at the corporation.

941
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,430
So that's, well, north of half a century now.

942
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,570
Our current executive's father hired me when I was fresh out of college.

943
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,790
He must have seen something in me all those years ago.

944
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:21,990
Again.

945
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,150
We gotta get some fish.

946
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,380
But also, I wanna see if there's anything else underneath here.

947
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,600
We got some dolphins.

948
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,620
Oh, it's a little dolphin family.

949
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,660
How cute.

950
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,060
Let's check out.

951
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,740
Maybe this boat has some good items.

952
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:58,040
Oh, oh no!

953
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:58,820
It's not a boat!

954
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,740
It's not a boat!

955
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,020
I'm gonna run into the tree!

956
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,600
I didn't run into the tree.

957
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,140
Why are all the boats not boats anymore?

958
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,140
Denden!

959
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,960
Welcome to Babusha, thank you.

960
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,460
Why is nothing a boat anymore?

961
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,110
Research pot.

962
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:23,810
Lucky!

963
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,750
Like, this is probably not a...

964
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:36,070
This is probably not a plane either, huh?

965
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,330
What is this?

966
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,330
Dog tags.

967
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,290
A pair of dog tags.

968
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,910
A name, number, and address is printed in duplicate.

969
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,210
I can hear it though.

970
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,250
It's like creaking and cracking.

971
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,250
Maybe this thing is real.

972
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,410
Maybe this thing is legit.

973
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,240
What?

974
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:17,450
It's a quest.

975
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,030
It seems like it because it was like glowing.

976
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,510
It says the name Raiden.

977
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,310
Yeah guys, this is the game.

978
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,370
You just fish and it's a good time.

979
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,470
Okay, I'm gonna go towards it.

980
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:44,630
Really?

981
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:46,050
Nothing?

982
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,070
Okay.

983
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,810
We might have gotten enough fish now.

984
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,690
Nope, nevermind.

985
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,770
We need to find a few more.

986
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,500
The wind is leading me towards something spooky.

987
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,360
Not even a crab.

988
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,540
Nothing at all.

989
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,380
How disappointing.

990
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,800
There's some fish.

991
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,360
Amelia Earhart.

992
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,800
She got eaten by the crabs.

993
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,960
What is your theory for Amelia Earhart?

994
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,980
Didn't they find her like somewhat recently?

995
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,060
Aliens.

996
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,560
Aliens.

997
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,560
Alright.

998
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,020
That's definitely enough.

999
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,220
She was sent to another world.

1000
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,420
If only we could all be so lucky.

1001
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:00,220
Leave me alone!

1002
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,640
Leave me alone!

1003
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:02,880
Leave me alone!

1004
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,660
She got isekai'd.

1005
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,780
The original isekai-er?

1006
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,200
Isekai-e.

1007
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:19,360
Where's Amelia Earhart and fate go?

1008
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,280
I got you some fish mister.

1009
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,120
There you go.

1010
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,660
Won't hold anymore.

1011
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,700
I'll fire it up.

1012
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,380
The crushing compactor clunks to life.

1013
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:38,700
The sound of pneumatic pistons and strange squelching soon gives way to the stuttering sound of distant gears.

1014
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,300
Not yet.

1015
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,970
One day perhaps.

1016
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,810
Wish she's a cute boy and fate go?

1017
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:56,670
Amelia Earhart?

1018
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,350
Why'd they make her a boy?

1019
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,390
The Voyager satellite is in FGO.

1020
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:03,170
Oh wow.

1021
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:05,850
We've done it!

1022
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:09,290
A large capsule drops down from the chute labeled Waste.

1023
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:13,810
Though it's clear walls you can see remnants of the fish you deposited.

1024
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,930
Well you probably will be able to use that for chum.

1025
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:23,790
Canister of malignant fish remains adorned with warning stickers and caution labels.

1026
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,530
Attracts wretched fish.

1027
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:28,510
We can get some freaky fish with this.

1028
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,230
Oh bait!

1029
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,750
Now we can finally get this drill started.

1030
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,190
All clear!

1031
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:42,550
I was wondering if after you get done with the MGS series would you be interested in trying Max Payne?

1032
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:43,590
Think you'd like it.

1033
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:46,610
Also everyone knows Amelia Earhart got eaten by the coconut crabs.

1034
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,470
Yeah that's why I said the crabs earlier.

1035
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:51,790
What a way to go.

1036
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,790
Initiating drill deployment in 3, 2, 1.

1037
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:59,470
The drill descends.

1038
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,770
Cut sand.

1039
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:11,070
Are we going to get some freaky fish from this?

1040
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,490
Oh that doesn't seem very good.

1041
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:19,110
Wait this seems pretty bad actually.

1042
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:20,690
Wait where is that headed to?

1043
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:22,010
What is that?

1044
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:22,690
What's that over there?

1045
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:33,100
The scientist walks over gripping handrails to counteract the shockwaves from the drill.

1046
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,400
We've broken through!

1047
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,960
We're underway at last.

1048
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,980
What about that huge crack that opened up?

1049
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,140
Is the reservoir stable?

1050
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:48,320
Admittedly the fissure is larger than my model suggested, but appears to have stabilized.

1051
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,620
We should consider halting the drilling for now.

1052
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,140
Planet Mike!

1053
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,480
Thank you so much for the 50 gifts!

1054
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,360
Thank you!

1055
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,300
What the heck?

1056
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,480
Thank you so much!

1057
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,780
No we're not the bad guys.

1058
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,720
We're just... I'm just a fisherman.

1059
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:12,420
We would be remiss in our duties to the local population if we didn't survey the area and gather some data.

1060
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,380
In that vein, fisherman, I have some...

1061
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,660
I don't work here!

1062
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,420
I have something for you.

1063
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:24,640
The factory has recently become operational, allowing us to manufacture equipment infused with the corporation's latest breakthroughs.

1064
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,100
This is the new design.

1065
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,880
Oh wait.

1066
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:28,760
Coastal up.

1067
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,120
Shallow up.

1068
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,100
I don't have room for this.

1069
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,100
Oh, hold on.

1070
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,000
I can store stuff.

1071
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,680
Oh wait, I don't want to store this fish.

1072
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,420
When do we get the pacific rim style giant mech of the... Oh my god!

1073
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:50,860
I wish.

1074
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,180
I guess I could have put that in storage too, huh?

1075
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:56,640
Wes!

1076
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,200
Thank you for the box!

1077
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,340
Using that rod, I need you to collect specimen samples from the morrows.

1078
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,760
Just check that the fish species are unaffected by our operations here.

1079
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,060
Wow, there's so much here!

1080
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,380
Wait, where did that fisher go to?

1081
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,840
Hey fisherman, thanks again for your help filling out that generator.

1082
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,780
I've reported our new operational status to HQ.

1083
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:29,460
In fact, they've given me a budget to compensate you for any additional biomass you bring in.

1084
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,480
Just see me at the generator and I'll pay you.

1085
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,960
We get paid for our fish now.

1086
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,860
I can now pay you for any biomass you add to the generator.

1087
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,340
The bigger the better, I assume.

1088
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,400
This isn't really my area.

1089
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,060
Dead space.

1090
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,720
Check your map and you can see the fisher zones.

1091
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,320
Oh, thank you.

1092
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:57,840
A figure emerges from lower decks and beckons you over into the shadows.

1093
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,020
Gosh, there's so much here!

1094
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:03,280
If you're going to be hanging around, maybe we could do business.

1095
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,560
Come see me at the wonder market.

1096
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,540
Hello.

1097
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:13,050
Wait, everybody wants me!

1098
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:16,450
Yeah, I'm just one fisherman, please!

1099
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:18,130
Oh, he wants the samples.

1100
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:18,510
Okay.

1101
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,850
Got some items you might be interested in.

1102
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,670
Don't ask where they came from.

1103
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:26,070
Better off not knowing.

1104
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:28,630
Can you make some basic repairs too?

1105
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,990
Oh, can make some basic repairs too.

1106
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,410
But it'll cost you.

1107
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:34,670
Oh, he also sells ice things.

1108
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:35,090
Okay.

1109
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:37,470
Interesting.

1110
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:42,170
You don't sell anything that's special.

1111
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,590
I'll take some research parts though.

1112
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:48,890
Okay, research.

1113
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:52,070
We're researching this bad boy.

1114
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,090
Yeah, the versatile rod.

1115
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,610
It's just their shipyard, yeah, pretty much.

1116
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,190
Nice.

1117
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,710
Now we can get the harvesting platform.

1118
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:08,510
Coastal shallow oceanic.

1119
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,510
150% fishing speed!

1120
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:20,630
It's nice to have as many... what's a foundry?

1121
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:24,770
A helmeted figure emerges from the shadows by a building site.

1122
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:26,010
He lifts his visor.

1123
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,870
Places are broken.

1124
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:30,890
He gestures to a pile of materials behind him.

1125
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,930
Oh, I have it, I have it, I have it.

1126
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:33,610
Thank you.

1127
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,030
That's all we need.

1128
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:37,090
We can get the foundry built.

1129
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,010
Okay, easy.

1130
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:42,650
Good to go.

1131
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:45,570
Basic materials can be worked here.

1132
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,150
Select a blueprint.

1133
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,190
Oh, we can make more.

1134
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,510
Or I can just go find them.

1135
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:54,510
Like I've been doing.

1136
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,910
We got the tech lab even.

1137
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:02,250
When the tech lab is operational, we'll be able to work on projects of a more technical nature.

1138
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:04,730
I have plans for the interchangeable module system.

1139
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:05,410
You'll see.

1140
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,410
I'll show you when we're set up here.

1141
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,570
Clear out my storage.

1142
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:13,610
Construct.

1143
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,450
Everything appears to be in order.

1144
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:19,350
MSF!

1145
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,430
At last, I'm excited for you to try some of these out.

1146
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,050
Enhanced lights.

1147
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,410
Enhanced spyglass.

1148
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,570
Enhanced fog horn.

1149
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:32,810
Makes your presence known.

1150
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,910
Forces to illuminate your surroundings.

1151
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:40,090
Okay, interesting.

1152
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:44,670
So they cost research parts and a...

1153
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:46,910
And a crate.

1154
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:47,570
Interesting.

1155
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,130
This is so different.

1156
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,530
All of a sudden, things are different.

1157
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:55,050
But I am... Oh wait.

1158
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:58,050
Maybe the foundry is still around, huh?

1159
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,050
Oh yeah, this makes this.

1160
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:00,290
Okay.

1161
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,610
I can't find cloth still.

1162
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:06,410
I've been looking for cloth.

1163
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,530
Maybe the factory...

1164
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,490
Welcome to the factory.

1165
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:22,890
Oh my gosh, this is...

1166
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,190
This changes everything.

1167
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,680
What's like the setup?

1168
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,080
I wish they had the...

1169
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,060
You know, the floating... Oops, my bad.

1170
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,500
The floating dock.

1171
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,580
I wish they had that so that I could...

1172
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:44,940
Research.

1173
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,380
Or, not research.

1174
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,340
Do the thing where I put the materials in, you know?

1175
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,520
That's the key.

1176
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,300
There isn't one.

1177
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:54,700
Wow.

1178
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,240
Alright, for now though...

1179
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,580
Let's check our map.

1180
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,280
I cannot get rid of this.

1181
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,000
I didn't really need it there to begin with.

1182
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,640
I wish I could get rid of the mark though.

1183
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,860
I've already been there.

1184
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,720
Oh, you can see it here.

1185
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,000
I see, I see.

1186
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,400
It looks so cool.

1187
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:23,640
Cool!

1188
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,730
Wait, what is it?

1189
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,030
What's yelling at me?

1190
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,550
It was like, there was an exclamation point, but I don't know what for.

1191
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,340
I'm just following the line.

1192
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,840
It's taking us to this one first.

1193
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,200
Whoa!

1194
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,860
It's so goopy.

1195
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:11,820
Got the bait ability.

1196
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,140
Oh, that's right!

1197
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,420
Yes, thank you, thank you.

1198
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,900
You guys know everything.

1199
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:18,580
You're so smart.

1200
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,180
Can I, like, go in this?

1201
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,160
Or am I gonna die?

1202
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,840
Only one way to find out.

1203
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,240
I don't have the shallow...

1204
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,740
Oh, I need shallow upgrade.

1205
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,280
If I go through this, is it slow?

1206
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,320
Slow.

1207
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,200
Interesting.

1208
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,700
That's so gross.

1209
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,680
Hold on, though.

1210
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,000
I do want to...

1211
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,720
I don't... Oh, wait.

1212
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,440
This place is always where it'll, like, respawn after a while.

1213
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,720
So we finally got some more cloth.

1214
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,560
Thank goodness.

1215
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,580
Oh, seriously?

1216
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,320
A stingy?

1217
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,120
Is this a Strand-type game?

1218
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,400
Unironically, yes.

1219
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,740
Unironically, yeah, I think so.

1220
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:27,960
One whole cloth.

1221
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,840
Hey, beggars can't be choosers.

1222
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:33,460
I'll take what I can get.

1223
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,320
My single cloth.

1224
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,760
Okay, but we definitely gotta get to...

1225
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,140
The Strand.

1226
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,700
We'll do that after.

1227
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,760
I'm opening up so many more...

1228
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,560
What's it called?

1229
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,760
So many more...

1230
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:09,450
Quests, and it's making me a little nervous.

1231
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,950
Because I have so much to do, you know?

1232
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:15,410
It's making my brain spin a little bit.

1233
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,150
And I think I should...

1234
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:21,570
I need two cloths!

1235
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:22,610
Please!

1236
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,230
So stingy!

1237
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:27,270
We can do the engine space, I suppose.

1238
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,690
I have so much material.

1239
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:32,470
Of everything else.

1240
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,160
Alright, we got engine space.

1241
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,560
We can do the light space.

1242
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,960
I don't need this, though.

1243
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,700
Ah, whatever.

1244
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,120
We gotta get it all eventually, you know?

1245
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,040
I guess this place could use some...

1246
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:51,240
Seamstresses!

1247
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,920
You got a light chuckle out of me.

1248
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,680
We could do the rod spaces, though.

1249
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,560
We only need one cloth for that.

1250
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:20,010
I'm debating.

1251
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,630
Save for extra cargo.

1252
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,110
I know, I want two also.

1253
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,890
And then we're also gonna have to get...

1254
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,130
I don't even know.

1255
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:31,150
Four!

1256
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:34,010
Four cloths!

1257
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:37,170
That's insane!

1258
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,510
That's craziness!

1259
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:47,130
That's insane!

1260
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:47,550
Insane!

1261
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,050
Game, I need more, please!

1262
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,810
Okay, so this is Coastal Shallow Bangor Volcanic.

1263
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,490
Coastal Shallow.

1264
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:01,730
This would be great.

1265
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,490
But then I can't do Oceanic.

1266
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:09,790
Like, I would have to...

1267
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,870
I probably have to get rid of the trawl net, huh?

1268
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,270
Can you buy cloth anywhere?

1269
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:16,490
I don't think so.

1270
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,910
I've never... I haven't seen it.

1271
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:31,150
Oh, you can at the foundry.

1272
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:38,370
If you get Tier 2 Foundry with Iron Rig, you can turn crates into cloth, wood, or salvage.

1273
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,170
I see, I see, I see.

1274
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,930
Oh yeah, I should sell my fish first, huh?

1275
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,190
Good reminder.

1276
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:49,830
Can

1277
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,580
I get the mangrove and the volcanic?

1278
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,840
Because we're about to kind of go into a mangrove area.

1279
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,580
So, I guess we could just store these.

1280
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:14,500
I'm assuming that the Abyssal and Hadol won't be in that area.

1281
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,690
You can always swap rods.

1282
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:30,890
Of course, obviously.

1283
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:37,290
But only if I'm at an area I can, you know what I mean?

1284
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:42,290
If I'm at an area that I can't, then I'm gonna...

1285
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:45,090
Get a bit of a pickle.

1286
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,010
Hadol is, I think, how you say it.

1287
01:18:51,130 --> 01:19:00,990
Oh, that's right, we got the infused rod too.

1288
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:16,990
Let's...

1289
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:23,450
Nah, we'll do this, because we're gonna go over there.

1290
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,510
Uninstall.

1291
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,290
And then install.

1292
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,290
Oh wait, it's okay.

1293
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,970
Uninstall please, sorry I messed up.

1294
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:39,290
Install, thank you.

1295
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:43,770
I feel like it would be better to have the space there.

1296
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:44,690
Okay, okay.

1297
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:48,390
Okay.

1298
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:49,930
Okay.

1299
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:50,410
Repair.

1300
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:52,650
Sleep.

1301
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,230
I miss Minto karaoke.

1302
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,750
Well, you'll have some next week.

1303
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:00,790
Some next week.

1304
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,050
And let's go to the Twisted Strand.

1305
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,430
Did I ever get that?

1306
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:11,830
Did I ever get the...

1307
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:14,210
No, I didn't do the upgraded engine, did I?

1308
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,830
Ah, whatever.

1309
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,780
Goopy.

1310
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,700
I got some ooze!

1311
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,220
Can I keep it?

1312
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,560
It's kinda cute actually.

1313
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:44,620
Really?

1314
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:50,440
What if it oozed some fish onto me?

1315
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,160
Hot dog!

1316
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:59,050
What does it taste like?

1317
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:01,590
What if it tastes like jelly?

1318
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,290
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

1319
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:06,050
I need to be going north.

1320
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,350
Hot dog.

1321
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:09,550
Hot dog!

1322
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,190
Minto just inked...

1323
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,010
What am I, an octopus?

1324
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:13,250
Octopus.

1325
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:18,760
Okay!

1326
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,980
Okay, okay.

1327
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,080
Tastes like smoky BBQ.

1328
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,720
I see you're not really...

1329
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:33,400
You're just making it more and more enticing.

1330
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:39,390
My hair kinda looks like a squid.

1331
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:45,480
Well, I mean, I guess I do leave a little bit of like...

1332
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:51,280
I mean, sometimes I leave like an ectoplasm.

1333
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,580
If it's like, you know...

1334
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,860
I can't help it.

1335
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,120
It just happens sometimes.

1336
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,380
Ooh, it's dusty here.

1337
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,160
The snail trail?

1338
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,420
Don't call it that!

1339
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,620
What we got in our net?

1340
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,000
Our net is huge.

1341
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,050
I don't know if I like this place.

1342
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:26,470
Is this the traveling merchant?

1343
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,550
But that's like a ghosty thing, you know?

1344
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,850
Like all ghosts do that.

1345
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:36,910
Rickety pontoon.

1346
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:42,530
I'm gonna store our cloth.

1347
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:43,970
I'm gonna store our backs...

1348
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:45,270
What is it called?

1349
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,730
Oh, dark splash.

1350
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,070
I thought it said backsplash.

1351
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:50,110
Mintomucin.

1352
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:52,210
Might be good for skin care.

1353
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:52,750
I don't know.

1354
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:57,050
I don't know, I don't know.

1355
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:58,350
We're gonna rest too.

1356
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,070
I know it's kind of early, but...

1357
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:03,050
I don't wanna go in there and sun down.

1358
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,310
You'd use it on your skin.

1359
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:07,110
You would.

1360
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:12,150
Here we go.

1361
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,150
What is this?

1362
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:23,690
Oh, that doesn't seem good.

1363
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:24,750
What are you?

1364
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:29,730
What is this?

1365
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:34,550
Oh, it's really creaky.

1366
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:35,890
Rickety.

1367
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:43,680
Mushrooms.

1368
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,320
Wait, what is this?

1369
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:46,860
Hold on.

1370
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,420
I should do some fishing in here.

1371
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:51,900
Magrove.

1372
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,800
I got a gar!

1373
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:03,170
Trophy gar.

1374
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,870
No!

1375
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,610
No!

1376
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,230
It didn't even give me the opportunity.

1377
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,260
Ok, let's just get a couple.

1378
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:24,110
I got a message in a bottle.

1379
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:30,950
Question mark, question mark, question mark.

1380
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,690
There's something over here too.

1381
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,590
Wait, what's this?

1382
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,180
What are you?

1383
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:40,940
Hello?

1384
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:42,860
No!

1385
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,040
I lost my gar!

1386
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:49,730
No!

1387
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:53,050
What is this?

1388
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:57,350
I was just trying to get close so I could...

1389
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,670
Where are gar goes?

1390
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,320
There's some scrap.

1391
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:15,760
We'll come back.

1392
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:21,790
What else is in here?

1393
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,920
Ok, something else.

1394
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:34,860
What are you?

1395
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,040
A sergeant fish?

1396
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,480
What's that?

1397
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:50,050
I heard something make a not so pleasant sound.

1398
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:52,910
You hear that?

1399
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:54,610
What are you?

1400
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,930
I thought that thing... I saw... There was something that poked its head out of the water earlier.

1401
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:01,050
I thought it was like guarding the little thing.

1402
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:02,990
So I was like, oh, ok.

1403
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,030
It must be something that I drive up to.

1404
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:14,430
Magrove.

1405
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:16,050
I guess we got a...

1406
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:19,010
I guess we got a repair again.

1407
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:21,210
Your boat sprung a leak!

1408
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:22,830
Oh, is that bad?

1409
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,110
Oopsie.

1410
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,590
I didn't realize it was that bad.

1411
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,930
We were just casually dying, casually sinking.

1412
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:38,010
No big deal.

1413
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:44,230
Yeah, don't worry about it.

1414
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:46,090
This area reminds me of Outer Wilds.

1415
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:47,970
Maybe that's why I don't like it.

1416
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:53,370
I've been thinking so much about Outer Wilds lately.

1417
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:55,470
Just how much I miss it.

1418
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:02,610
I'm really into this game, if you couldn't tell.

1419
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,870
I do really like it.

1420
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:11,010
I'm waiting for this guy to leave.

1421
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:18,210
I think it's because I've been playing a lot of stressful-ish games lately.

1422
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:25,730
And so, you know, some high action games and this one is very low key and I just feel good about it.

1423
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,990
You know what I mean?

1424
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:30,570
What's this?

1425
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,180
Hello?

1426
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,820
Why are there so many plane crashes here?

1427
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,300
Woah!

1428
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,560
They affect the mind?

1429
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,040
I'm past saving.

1430
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,840
Good thing we know that now.

1431
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,920
They can't harm me.

1432
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,580
What happened to them?

1433
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,280
Nice hat.

1434
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,340
Thanks.

1435
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,680
I do?

1436
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,720
You'll be up for it.

1437
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,560
You'll have a look.

1438
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:07,800
I do?

1439
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:15,540
Guys, do I look rugged and hardened like I've been trained by the... by the... by the sea?

1440
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,640
By the elements?

1441
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,300
Yeah.

1442
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:27,060
Yeah.

1443
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:28,880
Yeah.

1444
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,160
I'm hardened and rugged.

1445
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,180
I've been trained by the sea!

1446
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:45,080
I am... I looked into the void and I... I did this.

1447
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:52,810
Shiny and pristine.

1448
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,490
Oh.

1449
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,290
Oh.

1450
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:08,850
We went down to the north and east of where we are now.

1451
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:13,210
I can't do this anymore.

1452
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,710
I'll mark the possible crash sites on your map.

1453
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,910
You go and see what you can salvage.

1454
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:18,910
I've got one.

1455
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:19,510
I've got one.

1456
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,050
I've got one.

1457
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:21,170
I found parts of the mortar.

1458
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,910
You found one component but it's still missing a piece.

1459
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:26,750
Nearly there.

1460
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:27,330
Keep looking.

1461
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,730
How will you honor your squadmates?

1462
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:33,570
I've hung a few of their dog tags.

1463
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:37,930
Oh, the dog tags on the tree behind me is... Wait, that guy was pretty far out, no?

1464
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,040
The void was not prepared.

1465
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:50,100
Seems fitting enough, but I've only got tags from the ones I...

1466
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:53,760
You must understand, I've never found all their bodies.

1467
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:57,300
If you happen to find any of their dog tags, I could add them to the tree with their brothers.

1468
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:02,000
I have a number of mechanical doodads that might be useful.

1469
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,500
Here, take this one.

1470
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,240
In good faith, I'll give you more for each tag you bring me.

1471
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:10,700
Oh, I put it in inventory... or in storage.

1472
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,300
Tell me about the minesuckers.

1473
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,100
That's what they call me at the club.

1474
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:18,720
Oh no!

1475
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,080
That's what they usually start with.

1476
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:26,260
They start panicking and sweating and they turn really pale and they're just like...

1477
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,840
It's the minesucker!

1478
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:30,420
Oh no, run!

1479
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,020
And I'm like, hey!

1480
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,420
Here for a good time!

1481
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:43,980
Devilish creatures, through and through, they'll stalk you along the waterways and emerge suddenly, screeching their terrible song.

1482
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:50,220
The first time it happened to me, I saw shadows of my squadmates reaching out to me in a feverish dream.

1483
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,260
What will we see?

1484
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,720
Wait, I kind of want to see something.

1485
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,580
When I finally snapped out of it, I was covered in bloody scratches.

1486
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:57,600
They must have sent me running through the foliage.

1487
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,340
Since then, I've done my best to avoid the fiends.

1488
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,160
Their senses seem to be based on movement, so move carefully.

1489
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,720
Are there any shipwrecks around here?

1490
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:11,080
No, anything that meets its end here is quickly swallowed by the silt.

1491
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,440
Oh, okay.

1492
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:13,620
That's everything.

1493
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,420
Okay, so he marked on the map, right?

1494
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,160
Okay, so we gotta go out and around.

1495
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,160
Wait, what's... Oh, that's the...

1496
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:30,760
Wait, I do have storage here?

1497
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,280
Oh, you're right!

1498
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:34,760
I didn't notice, thank you.

1499
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:37,840
Cargo.

1500
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:39,620
Oh, here's my storage.

1501
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,340
And we can put that away.

1502
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,140
Thank goodness.

1503
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,380
I found a dog tag, here you go.

1504
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:50,980
Thank you.

1505
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,040
We'll hang them on the tree.

1506
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,260
Here is promised.

1507
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,400
Thank you!

1508
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:00,030
We have two.

1509
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,540
But I don't think I can... Oh, I can research here.

1510
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:14,600
Is there anything we should start working on?

1511
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:20,540
I could do some of the other engines, so we can get closer to the bigger engines.

1512
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,660
Or some of the nets.

1513
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,740
Get some good crab pots.

1514
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:33,450
Ability upgrades?

1515
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,270
What do you mean ability upgrades?

1516
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:47,050
Yeah, I didn't get the mangrove trawl net or the volcanic trawl net.

1517
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,770
I have crab pots!

1518
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:55,570
I have them!

1519
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:57,810
Ability upgrades from the rig.

1520
01:33:58,330 --> 01:34:01,130
Oh, that's right!

1521
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,030
That's right, that's right.

1522
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:02,750
Okay, you're right.

1523
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:03,590
We'll save.

1524
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:07,430
Undock.

1525
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:07,890
Okay.

1526
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:10,070
Alright, easy.

1527
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:11,070
Easy, soldier.

1528
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:17,490
I'm too fast and it's fast for my own good.

1529
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:23,770
Oh, I need C4!

1530
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:24,270
Okay.

1531
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:29,350
I'm gonna keep calling it that even though I know it's not C4.

1532
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:38,130
Lady.

1533
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:45,750
Seeing the artwork and UI for this game makes me think... makes me want to see...

1534
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,390
Wait.

1535
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:49,490
Makes me want to see you experience Disco Elysium.

1536
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:50,130
Oh yeah!

1537
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:52,830
I know that game.

1538
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:56,790
Okay.

1539
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:02,810
Undock.

1540
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:15,530
It was right over here.

1541
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:22,360
So if I just stand still he won't touch me?

1542
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,440
What, does he go after me or...

1543
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,440
Not quite sure.

1544
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,440
Once I'm braver...

1545
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:36,930
Use explosives.

1546
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:44,910
I'm taking a break from rewatching The Sopranos.

1547
01:35:49,150 --> 01:35:51,990
Thanks for sticking around.

1548
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:56,230
Where you see one mint, I see four.

1549
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:59,370
You have the wrong prescription, I think.

1550
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:02,810
Tattered Receipt.

1551
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:04,670
We got two messages in a bottle.

1552
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,430
For collection.

1553
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:33,290
Engraving is to be as follows.

1554
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:34,430
For Jay.

1555
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:36,270
My shining star.

1556
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:41,670
It feels like years since I have been born.

1557
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:43,870
I do not expect him to write.

1558
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:47,290
I just need to know that he thinks of me from time to time.

1559
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:49,370
The next few lines have been smudged out.

1560
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:51,130
He must return!

1561
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:52,970
More angry smudging follows.

1562
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:54,690
I have written him another letter.

1563
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:56,650
This will be the last one.

1564
01:36:58,230 --> 01:36:59,090
Jay Mint!

1565
01:36:59,190 --> 01:36:59,770
Jay Phantom!

1566
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:04,110
That's my grandpapa!

1567
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:12,340
It couldn't be.

1568
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:13,680
Jay Mint!

1569
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:14,360
Jay Phantom!

1570
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:28,310
This is tricky, guys.

1571
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:30,170
This is not for the weak.

1572
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,910
Don't come in here if you are a little baby.

1573
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:41,290
This is for only hardened veterans such as myself.

1574
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:43,250
What?

1575
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:44,630
Oh, this is for the gun.

1576
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:57,890
And that's some scrap over there.

1577
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:01,050
And we got some fishies.

1578
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:07,390
I thought I heard that thing emerge.

1579
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:10,750
I don't know.

1580
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:15,090
He didn't say where the other guy's dog tags were.

1581
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:16,750
I guess we just kind of have to...

1582
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:20,250
search around for them.

1583
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,560
The music is starting up.

1584
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,740
That was kind of freaky.

1585
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,240
That was pretty freaky, I'm not going to lie.

1586
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:44,320
What?

1587
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,440
This area is freaky.

1588
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,660
You are actually a wreckage?

1589
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,100
Wow, we have an actual wreckage.

1590
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,000
More dog tags!

1591
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,780
And a gold ring.

1592
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,420
I can sell that.

1593
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,220
Nice.

1594
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,820
This place looks so pretty and ominous.

1595
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,360
It does look pretty ominous.

1596
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,620
I gotta get out of here though, because I don't...

1597
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:19,360
I do not want to go around through here...

1598
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,480
with limited sunlight.

1599
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:23,740
It's already difficult.

1600
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:30,410
He is right behind me.

1601
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:32,910
Where is he?

1602
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:36,830
I don't know actually.

1603
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:43,130
I can...

1604
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:50,090
I got a fish.

1605
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:57,010
We can just go back to this guy's camp.

1606
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:00,590
OK.

1607
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:06,790
We made it.

1608
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:08,430
With limited injuries.

1609
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:10,730
Is this what Florida is like?

1610
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:12,890
I don't think there is enough...

1611
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:16,020
enough gators in this game...

1612
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:17,950
and enough freaky men.

1613
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:24,580
I found some dog tags.

1614
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:25,920
There you go, sir.

1615
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,060
Thank you very much.

1616
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,460
I found parts of the Mordor.

1617
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,060
Freaky gators.

1618
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,760
Disagree on the freaky men?

1619
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:39,660
What do you mean?

1620
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,440
What do you mean?

1621
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:42,500
That's like the whole thing.

1622
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,740
Florida man does freaky thing.

1623
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,480
That's the joke.

1624
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,760
The Florida man?

1625
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,100
This is Florida man.

1626
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,840
This guy is Florida man but not by choice.

1627
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:02,990
That's the lot.

1628
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:05,430
Now while I work on assembling the Mordor...

1629
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:08,490
you can get started on the next phase of the plan.

1630
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:09,050
Oh, I can?

1631
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:12,510
You may have noticed some contraptions in the lagoons around here.

1632
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:15,690
I've assembled those traps for the minesuckers.

1633
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:17,570
We just need to lure them in there.

1634
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:18,970
Ah, OK.

1635
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:20,930
Once they're in, you can see...

1636
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:23,910
Once they're in, you see, I can fire them with our new mortar.

1637
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:26,550
And that will be the end of them.

1638
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,470
No more nightmares.

1639
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:30,230
I'll mark the locations of the traps on your map.

1640
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:31,090
Got it?

1641
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:36,150
How do we get the minesuckers into the traps?

1642
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:38,950
They're attracted to some very specific types of bait.

1643
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:41,410
Your skills will come in handy here yet again.

1644
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:44,350
Is it safe?

1645
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:45,830
Of course not!

1646
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:47,270
Have you got everything?

1647
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:49,250
How do you make the traps?

1648
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:50,110
With patience.

1649
01:41:50,590 --> 01:41:52,210
The creatures only seem to sense movement.

1650
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:54,030
So whenever one was close, I froze.

1651
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:57,250
I understand.

1652
01:41:58,530 --> 01:41:59,250
What's next?

1653
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:04,170
We need to make three special baits from different combinations of fish.

1654
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:05,710
Alright, the first one.

1655
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:10,910
Ah, is this it?

1656
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:12,170
Yes.

1657
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:14,750
OK, we need...

1658
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:18,370
This guy needs braces.

1659
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:24,890
What about the second one?

1660
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:26,130
I don't have all the fish for the bait yet.

1661
01:42:26,210 --> 01:42:27,250
Come back when you've got the rest.

1662
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:28,930
What about the second one?

1663
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:31,170
I have this guy too.

1664
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:34,090
That looks like a catfish.

1665
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:36,910
OK.

1666
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:40,330
What about the third one?

1667
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:45,850
Two fish from the area.

1668
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:48,330
Time to go fishing!

1669
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:49,710
Time to go fishing!

1670
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:52,530
Where do I put the bait?

1671
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:54,690
One of the traps I've constructed in the lagoons.

1672
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:55,550
They're marked on your map.

1673
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:00,780
OK.

1674
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,660
So we got our homework.

1675
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,640
We have our homework here.

1676
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:07,800
Catfish... I don't think it was a gar.

1677
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,860
Because it would have said gar.

1678
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,460
Since I've fished that before.

1679
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:13,960
You know?

1680
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:22,310
It would have told me.

1681
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:25,350
Like, hey, this fish is...

1682
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:27,830
This, you know?

1683
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:47,810
What are you?

1684
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:51,030
I don't think we need you, but I'm still curious.

1685
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:54,330
A tarpon?

1686
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:59,370
We got ourselves a tarpon.

1687
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:03,270
Hello!

1688
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,830
We got something gross?

1689
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:10,770
This is him!

1690
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:11,210
Oops.

1691
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:17,090
Oh, it is a gar.

1692
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:18,130
You were right.

1693
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:18,990
Sorry.

1694
01:44:19,410 --> 01:44:21,890
I doubted you.

1695
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:22,970
I apologize.

1696
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:23,210
I apologize.

1697
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:27,530
OK, so we needed one of him.

1698
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,750
I fear I am lost.

1699
01:44:38,910 --> 01:44:39,830
What are you?

1700
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:41,970
I caught it.

1701
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:45,150
You knew it was a gar.

1702
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,550
OK,

1703
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:50,670
I need to go.

1704
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:57,450
Dang it.

1705
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,450
This area is so tricky.

1706
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,970
How do I get out of here?

1707
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:06,650
OK, through here.

1708
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:14,690
Through here?

1709
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:16,430
No.

1710
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:18,370
Through...

1711
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:19,030
Oh, the lighthouse.

1712
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,820
He is rumbling in my ear.

1713
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,240
It's our buddy.

1714
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:40,640
I much prefer him than some of these other guys in these areas, though.

1715
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,540
I'm not going in circles.

1716
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:44,460
I got it.

1717
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,100
We've got it.

1718
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:47,740
We're fine.

1719
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:48,580
We're fine.

1720
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,860
OK, I have money.

1721
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,380
We can repair.

1722
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:01,620
Oh, our fishing rod.

1723
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:02,140
Oopsie.

1724
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:05,480
OK, and I'm going to store these, too.

1725
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,420
Good thing we didn't lose them.

1726
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:09,260
OK.

1727
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:11,580
Alright.

1728
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:13,860
Good stuff.

1729
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:24,030
What are you?

1730
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:29,150
Do we need him?

1731
01:46:32,290 --> 01:46:34,890
I don't think so, but I'll...

1732
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:35,730
What is this thing?

1733
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:37,630
Sergeant fish.

1734
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,230
Don't you have a repair part?

1735
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:42,790
It was cheap.

1736
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:43,390
It's fine.

1737
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,970
Oh, we got him.

1738
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:56,540
This area is going to be hell to go through in the night time, so I'm kind of nervous.

1739
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,000
You know?

1740
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:03,180
Especially if they have the mist chasing after us.

1741
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:04,320
Can I...

1742
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,400
I don't want to test if I can run into the...

1743
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:10,900
This guy again.

1744
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:16,970
This guy again.

1745
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:19,150
I guess I could use my...

1746
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:20,670
What are you?

1747
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:22,190
Sergeant fish.

1748
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,260
Might be a night fish.

1749
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,760
You're so right.

1750
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,640
What if it is?

1751
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,640
No!

1752
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,140
What are you?

1753
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,240
What are you?

1754
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,400
Oh gosh.

1755
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,660
You sound so close sometimes.

1756
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,740
The last ones you need only come out at night.

1757
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:00,760
Well...

1758
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,860
It's becoming night.

1759
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,780
I can't tell if I can run through these mushrooms or not.

1760
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:16,480
Or if they are going to damage my boat.

1761
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:19,440
It's becoming night.

1762
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:27,570
He's far.

1763
01:48:40,090 --> 01:48:41,950
I'm just going to chill in this area.

1764
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:47,610
Mushrooms are bump safe?

1765
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:48,190
They are?

1766
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:48,930
Thank you.

1767
01:48:49,150 --> 01:48:50,430
Mushrooms don't damage.

1768
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:51,730
Thank you.

1769
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:55,610
Actually though, we might need to go to old man.

1770
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:59,730
Because we need to make the first bait.

1771
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:14,670
We got the stuff for the first bait.

1772
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:18,090
Why do I feel this sudden chill?

1773
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:19,070
She's here.

1774
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:21,530
She's finally here.

1775
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:22,990
Yeah!

1776
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:24,730
Minto plush!

1777
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:28,390
Thank you for ordering a golden box.

1778
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:31,470
There you go.

1779
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:32,590
I should do it.

1780
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:34,330
I'll just mix these in here.

1781
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:38,290
Load this into a trap then we'll get well clear from it.

1782
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:41,730
When the trap springs, I'll fire upon it with the mortar.

1783
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:45,630
Make sure you bring back proof that the thing is really dead.

1784
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:45,970
You hear?

1785
01:49:46,630 --> 01:49:46,970
Okay!

1786
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:59,070
I was going to sleep.

1787
01:49:59,210 --> 01:49:59,870
No, no, no, please!

1788
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:06,610
What's in here?

1789
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:08,550
Oh!

1790
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:09,150
It's a thing!

1791
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:11,770
I meet two of you!

1792
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:13,610
Long fin eel!

1793
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:17,110
Nice!

1794
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:18,810
That was easy.

1795
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:21,990
In fact, I'll collect even more of you.

1796
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:24,270
For money.

1797
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:28,150
Oh, I caught 250 fish from rods.

1798
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:31,110
Oops,

1799
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:42,140
I underestimated that.

1800
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:43,440
Okay, my bad.

1801
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,190
Sir, I have another bait.

1802
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:57,550
I have another bait.

1803
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:02,430
And I don't remember what the third one is that we need so I actually need to check.

1804
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:04,790
Wait for the last one.

1805
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:05,770
Here you go, sir.

1806
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:09,350
That should do it.

1807
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:10,750
Mix it in here.

1808
01:51:11,610 --> 01:51:12,770
Number three.

1809
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:13,650
Okay.

1810
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:16,990
Second one.

1811
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:19,550
Oh, it's a calf fish!

1812
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:25,250
They are the largest freshwater eel species and their blood is poisonous.

1813
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:30,090
At first I was going to say, yummy, and then you said poisonous.

1814
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:33,670
Well, it won't hurt me.

1815
01:51:41,550 --> 01:51:43,890
Where can I find the calf fish?

1816
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:49,810
Calf fish is a night time guy?

1817
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:55,070
I feel like a calf fish would be an all day guy.

1818
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:58,530
Calf fish is night only.

1819
01:51:58,770 --> 01:51:58,970
Okay.

1820
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:10,600
Maybe we do the first trap.

1821
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,180
I kind of want to see it.

1822
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:16,160
I won't be able to see it, you know, since it's so dark out.

1823
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,080
Can't see anything.

1824
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,500
Oh, there he is.

1825
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,540
Luckily this guy glows.

1826
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:29,250
Use my spyglass.

1827
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:31,330
Okay!

1828
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,470
Hooray, ten bones!

1829
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:35,150
Thank you, hello!

1830
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:37,590
Thank you.

1831
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:39,970
Thank you for ten bones!

1832
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,850
Thank you!

1833
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:08,230
And it could be a special guy too.

1834
01:53:10,670 --> 01:53:12,130
Oh, dang it.

1835
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:17,090
Catfish!

1836
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:20,610
Can I get more than one?

1837
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:22,830
Actually they are quite big.

1838
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:23,590
No!

1839
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:24,750
No!

1840
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,270
Oh wait, I can't.

1841
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:31,930
I just needed a Tetris.

1842
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:35,950
What was that?

1843
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:42,570
Okay, maybe it was nothing.

1844
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:51,690
I think the vines are moving.

1845
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:52,570
I think so too.

1846
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:55,950
I was like, wait a second, wasn't this...

1847
01:53:57,910 --> 01:53:59,070
Where did I come from?

1848
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:03,510
No!

1849
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:07,310
The vines are moving.

1850
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:14,430
Okay, we're fine.

1851
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:16,350
I think.

1852
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:19,370
I'm pretty sure it's over that way.

1853
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:27,520
Oh yeah, look at that.

1854
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:30,940
Are they gonna... wait.

1855
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:33,280
No, I'm going the wrong way.

1856
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:39,570
I don't want to get got by the guy.

1857
01:54:40,930 --> 01:54:42,370
I'm all tripped up here.

1858
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:49,680
Oh yeah, you know, the thing that has the sign.

1859
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,260
That says this way.

1860
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:54,600
Bait the trap?

1861
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:55,860
I want to do it in the daylight.

1862
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,220
Because I want to see it happen.

1863
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:01,900
It's okay, we can get all of them now.

1864
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:08,130
Let's talk about baiting the traps.

1865
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:09,790
Wait for the second one.

1866
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:12,310
Got my special catfish.

1867
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:14,530
Built this into the trap.

1868
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:18,250
Okay, I'm gonna go sell my fish too.

1869
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:22,690
See?

1870
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:26,890
Nice.

1871
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:29,150
Let's go sell.

1872
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:31,610
Let's go bait.

1873
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:34,770
I know where two of them are at least.

1874
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:44,810
If I bait it...

1875
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:48,030
A large cage is suspended over the water.

1876
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:50,330
A small receptacle is floating underneath.

1877
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:52,990
You loaded the bait into the trap.

1878
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:54,130
You should probably move...

1879
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:56,970
This is so unfair.

1880
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:05,250
That's so unfair!

1881
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,520
But we didn't lose anything!

1882
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:19,700
Oh my gosh, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

1883
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:24,620
That was almost so bad.

1884
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:26,740
Jeez!

1885
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,300
Get the proof.

1886
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,720
Hold your horses!

1887
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:36,580
Hold your horses!

1888
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:44,500
Four hundred forty three dollars.

1889
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:47,480
Nice.

1890
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:53,500
And let's repair.

1891
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:58,800
Nice.

1892
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:00,700
Okay.

1893
01:57:05,950 --> 01:57:06,880
Let's get our proof.

1894
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,240
It's my first time doing a super chat.

1895
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,080
It's my birthday!

1896
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:15,460
Can this skelly get a special MGS happy birthday?

1897
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:17,040
Of course!

1898
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,520
Skeletal guzzler.

1899
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:22,580
Happy birthday!

1900
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:23,140
Congratulations!

1901
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:28,520
Happy birthday with salutations!

1902
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,460
Happy birthday!

1903
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:33,300
May your sky stay blue!

1904
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:37,920
Happy birthday to you!

1905
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:40,940
Happy birthday Skeletal guzzler!

1906
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:42,220
Happy birthday!

1907
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:44,280
Thank you for the first ever super chat!

1908
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:44,940
Thank you!

1909
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:46,760
Okay.

1910
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:50,400
Inside is the obliterated corpse of a minesucker.

1911
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,140
Chunk of flesh!

1912
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,960
The rest of the carcass sinks out of sight.

1913
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:56,880
Goodbye!

1914
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:58,220
This way.

1915
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,820
Next one.

1916
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:05,380
Hopefully he doesn't, you know, appear right in front of me.

1917
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:07,180
Alright, let's try the mushrooms.

1918
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:11,920
They are safe, but I still get...

1919
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,040
I still get bumped.

1920
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:16,480
That was close.

1921
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:20,100
Will these guys stop showing up then when I...

1922
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:22,320
when I get them all?

1923
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:32,070
So we will be able to freely roam through here.

1924
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:33,130
That's kind of nice.

1925
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:35,770
Okay.

1926
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:38,670
You load the bait.

1927
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:40,010
You should move away.

1928
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:46,890
Jump!

1929
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:03,220
Now we just need to know where the third one is.

1930
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:10,470
Very good.

1931
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:16,320
Kaboom.

1932
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,140
Very nice, very nice.

1933
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:24,880
I chose the hard way.

1934
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:25,780
Why did I do this?

1935
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:29,840
Thread the needle!

1936
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,840
The last one, I imagine...

1937
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:37,660
Oh, he marked it.

1938
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:42,840
So if we go through here...

1939
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,840
Not gonna lie, I'm gonna miss having this because it's a nice little...

1940
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,840
It's a nice...

1941
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:53,740
marker.

1942
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:55,540
You know?

1943
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,860
So if I go through here...

1944
01:59:57,860 --> 01:59:59,820
Do I need to explode something or no?

1945
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,640
Go down here.

1946
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,040
Wait.

1947
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:06,600
No, through here.

1948
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:08,880
Sorry, I thought it was blocked off.

1949
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:12,660
What do you do?

1950
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:13,480
Oh, there it is, there it is.

1951
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:17,240
Yeah, a little landmark.

1952
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:17,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1953
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:30,210
There he goes.

1954
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:31,670
He's kind of cute though.

1955
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:34,190
I like him.

1956
02:00:37,010 --> 02:00:37,590
Jump!

1957
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:50,050
Okay, let's get the last one.

1958
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:51,890
And we're good to go.

1959
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:59,660
There we go.

1960
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:04,340
This place is dangerous with fast...

1961
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:08,280
If you have any speed on ya.

1962
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:11,720
Ah.

1963
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:20,940
Drifto.

1964
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:28,120
Initial M.

1965
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:30,680
Fermito.

1966
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:35,680
You should have seen them chasing you.

1967
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:36,280
It's okay.

1968
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:39,020
I'm scared.

1969
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,200
Mr. Airman.

1970
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:44,940
I have the creature corpse to show you.

1971
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,020
Let's see it then.

1972
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:50,100
We hand the tattered lump of flesh to the Airman.

1973
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:54,820
It's almost unrecognizable, but you both know it couldn't have belonged to anything else.

1974
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:00,160
He pokes at it with his knife, testing the rubbery meat.

1975
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:01,380
He seems satisfied.

1976
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:03,380
This is one of the beasts.

1977
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:04,380
Progress at least.

1978
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:05,160
More to go though.

1979
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,080
Oh, you have more?

1980
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:06,500
Yup.

1981
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:09,720
He gives it a few slashes with the knife.

1982
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:10,680
It wobbles a little.

1983
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:14,120
I have more, yes.

1984
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:20,360
You drop the large, bloody carcass in front of the Airman, his eyes filled with sadistic delight.

1985
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:23,740
He bends down and plunges his knife into the soft flesh.

1986
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,960
It falls away before the blade, revealing a glint of metal.

1987
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:27,980
Wait, is this our thing?

1988
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:33,820
With a sickening tear, he wrests it from where it was embedded in the flesh of the creature.

1989
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:35,240
He holds it aloft.

1990
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:38,160
You recognize it as a necklace, glistening in gore.

1991
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:43,920
He steps back from the corpse.

1992
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:46,040
A melancholic look comes over his face.

1993
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:48,600
And now, well, that's that, I suppose.

1994
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:51,940
What will you do now?

1995
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,580
Can't say for sure.

1996
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,100
I thought I'd be asking you for an escort away from this place, but...

1997
02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:59,140
This has become somewhat of a home to me.

1998
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:01,500
It doesn't feel right to leave my brothers here.

1999
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:04,180
I think I shall stay a while longer.

2000
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:07,720
In the meantime, I can make up some special bait for you.

2001
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:09,120
It ought to help with your fishing.

2002
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:14,480
This was leftover from the other bait we made.

2003
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:19,160
Now you can make some fresh stuff if you like.

2004
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:21,600
Okay, just any kind of fish?

2005
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:22,620
And you'll make bait?

2006
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:25,160
What if I give you only grey mullet?

2007
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:30,040
The ultimate grey mullet meal, with a little bit of anchovy king.

2008
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:35,880
What if I give you, like, so much of it?

2009
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:37,340
Like, every single thing.

2010
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,120
We got so much!

2011
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,840
They go crazy for that stuff, day and night.

2012
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:54,900
Doesn't seem to matter.

2013
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:56,600
All sorts of fish usually show up.

2014
02:03:58,140 --> 02:03:59,140
Okay, thank you!

2015
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:03,490
We're gonna undock.

2016
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:05,950
And we're going to manifest!

2017
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:10,270
Nice.

2018
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:17,910
Wow, it's so weird seeing the oil rig in the background now.

2019
02:04:20,890 --> 02:04:22,610
We've destroyed this place.

2020
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:24,190
We've destroyed the ecosystem.

2021
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:28,850
Is there a chance of seeing Mint Phantom on Inzoy?

2022
02:04:29,010 --> 02:04:29,730
I don't know.

2023
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:31,950
I actually don't know anything about the game.

2024
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:37,390
I was watching Kiara with her character creation earlier.

2025
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:40,670
But it only seemed fun because she had the full body tracking and everything.

2026
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:44,950
It's like The Sims.

2027
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:48,210
She didn't even play any of the game.

2028
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,090
All she did was...

2029
02:04:51,090 --> 02:04:53,130
All she did was the character creation.

2030
02:04:58,170 --> 02:04:59,890
Her stream was so funny though.

2031
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:01,950
I was literally laughing out loud.

2032
02:05:03,210 --> 02:05:04,530
It was so funny.

2033
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:05,790
Hello mister!

2034
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:09,710
You enter the house carrying the ornate necklace.

2035
02:05:09,890 --> 02:05:11,930
The collector recognizes it almost immediately.

2036
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:13,790
An excellent find.

2037
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:16,410
It demands pride of place in my collection.

2038
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:19,350
Relinquish the necklace.

2039
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:21,750
That's the achievement I just got.

2040
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:27,470
He sweeps aside some scraps on a dusty table, candle wax pooling in its corners.

2041
02:05:27,730 --> 02:05:29,830
He places the necklace carefully in the clearing.

2042
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:33,790
And I suppose you'll be demanding recompense as well?

2043
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:34,950
I hope so!

2044
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:40,050
He is opening up the book, dust pouring from the pages as he reads aloud.

2045
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:43,270
You begin to feel weak, but you're rooted to the spot.

2046
02:05:43,570 --> 02:05:45,650
Knees on the verge of buckling.

2047
02:05:47,910 --> 02:05:48,470
Atrophy.

2048
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:51,210
Instantly harvest an entire shoal of fish?

2049
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:55,970
Aren't just the character builder and build...

2050
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:58,690
I think she got early access is what she said.

2051
02:05:59,390 --> 02:06:01,030
She LOL'd out loud.

2052
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:01,810
Yeah, I did.

2053
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:03,290
I was LOLing.

2054
02:06:03,770 --> 02:06:05,090
I was LMFAOing.

2055
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:11,610
As he finishes speaking, you feel blood rushing back to your legs.

2056
02:06:11,930 --> 02:06:14,670
A strange feeling of power grows in your chest.

2057
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:17,030
We're so close.

2058
02:06:17,390 --> 02:06:18,370
One more remains.

2059
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:23,850
I loathe to suggest it, but the abyssal plane on the approach to Devil's Spine is a likely candidate.

2060
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:25,750
See what you can find.

2061
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:27,650
I'll mark a location on your map.

2062
02:06:27,650 --> 02:06:28,790
Anything else?

2063
02:06:29,390 --> 02:06:30,350
What'd you do to me?

2064
02:06:31,810 --> 02:06:32,370
Atrophy.

2065
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:38,550
Disphrase in silly calls the closest shoal of fish, readying them for swift reaping.

2066
02:06:38,650 --> 02:06:43,050
It can be heard from a great distance, so you not be close to your victims.

2067
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:46,910
But the population is unlikely to recover from such vile trauma.

2068
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:48,410
Use it sparingly.

2069
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:49,870
Call?

2070
02:06:50,210 --> 02:06:52,650
Wait, so they just never respond?

2071
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:53,570
Or...

2072
02:06:53,570 --> 02:06:54,670
I'm gonna use it right now.

2073
02:06:55,210 --> 02:06:56,750
A little fish.

2074
02:06:58,290 --> 02:06:59,730
Oh my gosh, we have everything!

2075
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:08,170
Infected.

2076
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:09,410
Wait, what do you mean infected?

2077
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:09,730
Wait.

2078
02:07:11,010 --> 02:07:13,050
We've never seen an infected fish before.

2079
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:19,730
That's...interesting.

2080
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:23,410
Oh, why didn't I press the take all button?

2081
02:07:23,590 --> 02:07:23,750
Sorry.

2082
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:26,830
Is there a cool down on it?

2083
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:27,350
Must be.

2084
02:07:27,950 --> 02:07:28,770
On cool down.

2085
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:32,110
What's the oil fish?

2086
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:45,460
Can I still sell them?

2087
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,320
Keep using it.

2088
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:50,160
Did you not see the cool down?

2089
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:52,440
It said on cool down.

2090
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:56,680
It's worth nothing.

2091
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:57,480
No way!

2092
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:01,720
I haven't seen that strange red light in a while.

2093
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,680
Wonder what it was.

2094
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:03,520
Hey, are you okay?

2095
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:05,740
The sky like...

2096
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:06,880
Oh, it is actually worthless.

2097
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:07,760
That sucks.

2098
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:15,830
This can also get volcanic, so that's good.

2099
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:21,810
Talk to the dock worker.

2100
02:08:23,370 --> 02:08:23,730
Okay.

2101
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:27,770
Don't do that.

2102
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:28,850
I don't like when you do that.

2103
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:30,550
I really don't like when you do that.

2104
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:32,410
That one scares me the most.

2105
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:33,570
Not gonna lie.

2106
02:08:34,110 --> 02:08:34,910
I don't know what it is.

2107
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:35,870
Just about the lights.

2108
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:39,310
Oh, I was like, what the heck is that red stuff?

2109
02:08:40,770 --> 02:08:43,270
I don't know.

2110
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:44,130
I don't like it.

2111
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:45,690
I just don't like it.

2112
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:53,550
Did you see the MGS Duran Duran edit of you?

2113
02:08:54,030 --> 02:08:54,810
Yeah, I did.

2114
02:08:56,350 --> 02:08:56,890
Wow!

2115
02:08:58,490 --> 02:08:59,690
That's so cool!

2116
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:08,290
Depleted.

2117
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:09,810
Cool fish.

2118
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,680
Red light equals spooky.

2119
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:21,680
Red equals scary.

2120
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:23,960
Dock worker.

2121
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:30,380
The dock worker is standing motionless on the edge of the dock, staring down at the water.

2122
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:33,020
He seems paralyzed by fear at what he sees.

2123
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:34,320
What's wrong?

2124
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:35,880
He stares ahead in silence.

2125
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:37,000
You stand with him for a while.

2126
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:40,540
Occasionally, a tremor shakes his body, and his breathing becomes labored.

2127
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:42,280
Are you alright?

2128
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:44,120
He seems unable to respond.

2129
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,360
He strains, strains, clenching his fists.

2130
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:49,300
Eyes shut tight with effort.

2131
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:50,940
A tear rolls down his cheek.

2132
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,460
What happened?

2133
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:55,560
You notice his neck and overalls are covered in a dark fluid.

2134
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:58,760
The same dark fluid that was leaking from the package you delivered earlier.

2135
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:00,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2136
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:03,100
His body relaxes suddenly and his eyes snap open again.

2137
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:04,920
They were cloudy and expressionless.

2138
02:10:05,420 --> 02:10:06,800
Fluid rattles through his lungs.

2139
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:12,240
A drop of dark ooze falls from one of his ears and lands on the dock.

2140
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:15,780
It slips between the boards and disappears into the waters below.

2141
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:18,480
What was that?

2142
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:20,100
Eww!

2143
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:25,160
A trembling head turns ever so slightly towards you.

2144
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:30,860
His breathing grows heavy in anger until you step backwards, leaving him standing there on the dock.

2145
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:40,180
He's got ectoplasm problems too.

2146
02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:48,650
We're really starting to fill out our book.

2147
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:55,290
We got these big boys though.

2148
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:58,190
Big man... Oh, the mangrove.

2149
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:00,190
Is that a rare fish?

2150
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:01,930
Maybe not.

2151
02:11:03,790 --> 02:11:05,170
It's ectoplasm season.

2152
02:11:06,810 --> 02:11:08,450
Eww, look at that guy!

2153
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:09,570
That's so gross!

2154
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:12,090
Whoa!

2155
02:11:12,330 --> 02:11:13,370
This guy!

2156
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:14,210
Whoa!

2157
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:15,710
We haven't even caught the original.

2158
02:11:16,690 --> 02:11:17,250
Whoa!

2159
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:19,270
There's so many more.

2160
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:24,270
At least 150 or more to see.

2161
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:30,730
Should we go to the... Let's go to the oil rig, I think, maybe.

2162
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:36,520
Thank you for telling me to talk to that guy.

2163
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:37,180
That was freaky.

2164
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:38,240
I liked it.

2165
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:46,450
I can grab some wood.

2166
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:54,170
Thank you.

2167
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:55,530
Oh, I gotta sell my fish.

2168
02:11:57,370 --> 02:11:58,390
Let's sell my fish.

2169
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:02,630
Hey, hey.

2170
02:12:02,910 --> 02:12:04,270
No spooky rocks here, please.

2171
02:12:04,410 --> 02:12:04,810
Thank you.

2172
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:10,470
Well, there used to be 150.

2173
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:11,970
Now there's like 200 something.

2174
02:12:12,210 --> 02:12:12,830
Oh, fisherman.

2175
02:12:13,110 --> 02:12:13,450
What is it?

2176
02:12:13,570 --> 02:12:14,470
You look a touch troubled.

2177
02:12:14,770 --> 02:12:15,950
Is the fog starting to get to you?

2178
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:17,610
Completely normal around here.

2179
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:18,470
Nothing to worry about.

2180
02:12:18,990 --> 02:12:21,090
With a good night's rest, you'll be right as rain by morning.

2181
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:23,390
Oh, he's telling me that I'm freaking out.

2182
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:25,390
Oh, fine.

2183
02:12:25,790 --> 02:12:26,730
I'll sleep.

2184
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:29,830
They love me.

2185
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:32,470
They love me.

2186
02:12:32,610 --> 02:12:33,930
They're asking if I'm well.

2187
02:12:39,230 --> 02:12:40,430
It's just the ring.

2188
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:44,850
We'll wait until we get a little bit more trinkets and then we'll sell.

2189
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:47,870
I wasn't gonna sleep.

2190
02:12:48,150 --> 02:12:51,810
I was just gonna go all the way there, but...

2191
02:12:51,810 --> 02:12:53,450
They love me or something.

2192
02:12:53,870 --> 02:12:54,770
They care for me.

2193
02:12:57,930 --> 02:12:59,510
That was some sick drifting.

2194
02:13:00,210 --> 02:13:01,310
Do I do say so myself?

2195
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:06,090
I am feeding them.

2196
02:13:07,410 --> 02:13:07,970
True.

2197
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:10,550
I am feeding them.

2198
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:11,930
Yeah, that is true.

2199
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:14,010
They get food from me.

2200
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:16,330
Do you think there's more than just one cloth here?

2201
02:13:17,470 --> 02:13:17,990
Let's hope.

2202
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:28,660
Oh, no!

2203
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:29,100
Please!

2204
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:30,240
I need cloth!

2205
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:34,160
Please!

2206
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,500
Just one.

2207
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,740
Just one cloth.

2208
02:13:42,220 --> 02:13:45,020
I was so excited for a second.

2209
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:47,250
Actually...

2210
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:51,510
You know how people do Pokemon Snatcher Pass?

2211
02:13:51,570 --> 02:13:53,830
You can do a Dredgfish Feast or Release.

2212
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,650
Feast or Release!

2213
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:00,850
I'm gonna go to our little lady friend over here.

2214
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:06,710
And then we'll go to the oil rig.

2215
02:14:06,970 --> 02:14:07,570
It's right there.

2216
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:23,090
My reasoning is, I want to use the cloth to do the upgrade before we...

2217
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:29,070
Yeah, I want to do the upgrade, but I didn't want to go all the way back to the initial town.

2218
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:32,850
Feast!

2219
02:14:33,190 --> 02:14:34,830
I think I would feast on anything.

2220
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:37,430
I would feast on all of them.

2221
02:14:38,450 --> 02:14:39,150
Maybe.

2222
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:42,390
Might defeat the purpose.

2223
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:46,730
I can get this guy!

2224
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:47,850
That's fun.

2225
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:49,250
New fish!

2226
02:14:50,110 --> 02:14:50,550
New fish!

2227
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:52,410
Frill!

2228
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:53,810
It's a frill shark!

2229
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:55,970
These guys are real too.

2230
02:14:56,750 --> 02:14:57,670
These guys are real guys.

2231
02:14:58,630 --> 02:14:59,010
Nice.

2232
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:02,130
Good find.

2233
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:02,250
Good find.

2234
02:15:13,870 --> 02:15:15,230
Let's try this one too.

2235
02:15:16,090 --> 02:15:16,770
It's right here.

2236
02:15:20,770 --> 02:15:24,410
An armored sea robin.

2237
02:15:25,010 --> 02:15:26,690
This thing is ugly.

2238
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:37,900
Sea robin.

2239
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:41,960
Hello ma'am.

2240
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:44,620
I've come to sell my fish.

2241
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:46,880
Thank you.

2242
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:50,120
And the floating dock.

2243
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:54,940
We were wanting the cargo space.

2244
02:16:01,130 --> 02:16:02,570
300 dollars!

2245
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:08,330
We got 4 new cargo spaces baby.

2246
02:16:08,570 --> 02:16:10,590
And now we just need 1 cloth.

2247
02:16:11,350 --> 02:16:14,010
And then we'll need... We need 5 cloth.

2248
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:21,390
3 scrap, 4 plank, 3 special metal.

2249
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:25,770
What's our storage look like now?

2250
02:16:28,230 --> 02:16:29,150
Pretty good.

2251
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:30,210
Pretty good.

2252
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:32,050
Pretty good.

2253
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:32,810
Pretty good.

2254
02:16:33,090 --> 02:16:34,290
And we got a lot of research.

2255
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:36,370
We have a lot of research parts.

2256
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:40,050
Wait, what if I... One moment.

2257
02:16:40,050 --> 02:16:42,250
What if I do this?

2258
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:43,090
Okay, watch.

2259
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,350
Bait.

2260
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:49,950
Use mixed bait to attract 3 different species.

2261
02:16:50,630 --> 02:16:52,010
And then, watch this.

2262
02:17:01,010 --> 02:17:03,030
Yasified sea robin.

2263
02:17:03,630 --> 02:17:05,170
Snake mackerel.

2264
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:19,900
I would like to sell my fish.

2265
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:22,500
78 bucks, that's it.

2266
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:24,500
Stingy.

2267
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:28,540
Sleep.

2268
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:33,340
Did that use up all my bait?

2269
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:34,620
Is it one time use?

2270
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:35,600
Actually I didn't check.

2271
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:38,720
Yes it did.

2272
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:40,400
We'll grab another couple then.

2273
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,220
We'll grab a couple.

2274
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:49,320
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.

2275
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:54,880
We must make haste.

2276
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:58,400
Lest those little guys come and try to eat us.

2277
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:00,940
This looks big.

2278
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:03,540
This looks like money.

2279
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:06,860
Money.

2280
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,260
I sound like Mr. Krabs.

2281
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:12,420
I'm becoming a real fisherman, aren't I guys?

2282
02:18:15,610 --> 02:18:16,410
Money.

2283
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:20,470
What are you?

2284
02:18:22,050 --> 02:18:23,870
A pale skate.

2285
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:26,150
It's so cute.

2286
02:18:31,570 --> 02:18:33,330
He's so cute.

2287
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:40,100
None of these look like...

2288
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:45,860
I know that's scrap.

2289
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:46,780
Then what is that?

2290
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:47,740
Is that also scrap?

2291
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:48,500
It looks like it.

2292
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:50,400
Is there no...cloth?

2293
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:54,780
Oh my god!

2294
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:56,460
Cloth!

2295
02:19:04,350 --> 02:19:05,710
More cloth!

2296
02:19:07,410 --> 02:19:10,750
I don't know why it's so hard finding cloth in this game.

2297
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:14,270
Oh my god.

2298
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:15,870
Oh my god.

2299
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:18,150
We just need...

2300
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:19,910
Two more pieces.

2301
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:23,050
We just need two more pieces.

2302
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:25,130
Awesome.

2303
02:19:27,550 --> 02:19:29,450
Do we only have the Iron Rig DLC?

2304
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:30,770
No, we have both.

2305
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:37,820
I forgot what this guy wanted me to do.

2306
02:19:38,460 --> 02:19:39,740
I know it's marked on the map.

2307
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,040
I'll do it eventually, I guess.

2308
02:19:50,810 --> 02:19:52,750
There's like a big island.

2309
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:57,390
I can see the island, I just didn't know it was ever there.

2310
02:19:58,390 --> 02:19:59,930
Fishing more important.

2311
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:01,250
So true.

2312
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:05,010
So, so true.

2313
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:15,300
What are the DLCs?

2314
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:15,970
There's...

2315
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:22,720
There's one for this oil rig that we're about to head to.

2316
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:25,580
And then there's a...

2317
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,720
There is a...

2318
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:32,000
Ice area.

2319
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:37,540
That I kind of explored just a teensy teensy bit before.

2320
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,620
At the beginning.

2321
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:42,940
At the beginning of the stream, I mean.

2322
02:20:47,970 --> 02:20:49,390
I see glow...

2323
02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:52,230
Glowing fish.

2324
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:55,190
Red roses too.

2325
02:20:56,170 --> 02:20:57,930
Please don't haunt me.

2326
02:21:00,310 --> 02:21:01,290
Fine.

2327
02:21:04,850 --> 02:21:05,970
You ass.

2328
02:21:17,490 --> 02:21:18,810
It's like right on it.

2329
02:21:21,810 --> 02:21:22,930
You stinky...

2330
02:21:25,010 --> 02:21:26,270
Oh, that's right.

2331
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:27,690
He wanted me to find some stuff.

2332
02:21:28,030 --> 02:21:28,930
What did he want me to find?

2333
02:21:29,790 --> 02:21:31,290
Oh, that's alright.

2334
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:32,470
It's all in the...

2335
02:21:32,470 --> 02:21:33,050
Crab!

2336
02:21:33,810 --> 02:21:34,950
It's all in like the...

2337
02:21:35,810 --> 02:21:36,190
Area.

2338
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:40,550
But we can get paid.

2339
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:43,410
Undermarket?

2340
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:44,450
Do you pay me?

2341
02:21:44,670 --> 02:21:44,810
No.

2342
02:21:45,310 --> 02:21:45,910
Who pays me?

2343
02:21:46,170 --> 02:21:47,230
The generator pays me.

2344
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:50,710
Thank you, sir!

2345
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:54,010
Foundry.

2346
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:56,190
Okay, I have to remember what everything does.

2347
02:21:57,530 --> 02:21:58,570
Tech lab.

2348
02:21:59,790 --> 02:22:00,670
This is $50.

2349
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:03,650
Enhanced lights.

2350
02:22:06,530 --> 02:22:09,730
I don't really use my foghorn, but...

2351
02:22:13,050 --> 02:22:17,290
Can identify fishing spots at a distance and mark them on... Mark them on your map?

2352
02:22:18,490 --> 02:22:24,430
I think the stronger lights probably will be good for me.

2353
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:31,800
I want to know what tier 2 is.

2354
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:37,400
Captain Minto, could I please get a shanty for my birthday?

2355
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,400
Uh... uh...

2356
02:22:41,140 --> 02:22:42,060
You can.

2357
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:44,460
Just don't expect much.

2358
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:47,160
Uh, yo ho!

2359
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:55,280
I've been sailing the seas for many sea times.

2360
02:22:55,880 --> 02:23:00,860
And I've never seen a Dr. Tyrannosaur quite as fine.

2361
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:06,180
And on his lovely sea birthday, we all yip and cheer.

2362
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:11,280
And grab yourself some spirits and beer.

2363
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:13,600
Yo ho, it's your birthday.

2364
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:16,680
Yo ho, we just celebrate.

2365
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:19,200
Yo ho, it's your birthday.

2366
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:21,500
Now get back to fishing.

2367
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:26,240
Yay!

2368
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:29,740
Was that one better than before?

2369
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:36,300
Was that better than before?

2370
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:38,040
That was amazing.

2371
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:43,980
Bears, welcome to membership.

2372
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:44,840
Thank you!

2373
02:23:46,380 --> 02:23:46,880
Alrighty.

2374
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:48,460
I need another box.

2375
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,280
We'll go find one in the wild.

2376
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:52,580
Wait, how...

2377
02:23:52,580 --> 02:23:55,380
What do we need to like, make one?

2378
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:56,380
Oh, that's right.

2379
02:23:56,480 --> 02:23:57,300
Cloth and...

2380
02:23:57,900 --> 02:24:00,140
I don't think I have... Oh no, I have everything.

2381
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:03,520
What's tier 2 though?

2382
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:05,720
What is tier 2?

2383
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:09,780
The shanties sold me.

2384
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:15,980
You can count on me singing silly songs.

2385
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:23,720
I'm guessing for these, I need the initial part, right?

2386
02:24:23,860 --> 02:24:27,380
So we have this one, the winch.

2387
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,340
Yes.

2388
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:31,720
Oh, and a dark canister.

2389
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:33,260
And a crate.

2390
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:36,140
Okay.

2391
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:36,700
Interesting.

2392
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:41,420
Oh wait, infused winch.

2393
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:41,800
Wait.

2394
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:43,400
What do I have?

2395
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:44,880
What do you need?

2396
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:47,600
Oh, hydraulic rod.

2397
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:57,900
We got the infused rod.

2398
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,780
They gave me that.

2399
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:01,240
So I don't need to purchase it.

2400
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,520
Complete missions to get it.

2401
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:10,780
Okay, okay.

2402
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,080
Like the science lab one.

2403
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:16,440
Okay, so we're gonna go to the Undermarket.

2404
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:19,160
And we're gonna have him install...

2405
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,240
This.

2406
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:27,480
So uninstall...

2407
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,500
For now.

2408
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:35,280
And we're gonna install...

2409
02:25:36,780 --> 02:25:37,460
This.

2410
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:44,620
And I guess we could install something else too.

2411
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:45,740
We can stack it.

2412
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:56,080
I wanted to see what the install time was.

2413
02:25:58,380 --> 02:25:58,920
Okay.

2414
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:02,990
Repair.

2415
02:26:04,230 --> 02:26:05,470
What did I miss?

2416
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:07,390
Not much, not much.

2417
02:26:07,430 --> 02:26:08,090
I'm just fishing.

2418
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:10,210
I'm just fishing.

2419
02:26:19,170 --> 02:26:21,390
We'll go find some more boxes.

2420
02:26:22,730 --> 02:26:23,250
Sleep.

2421
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:26,070
And let's go to the goopy areas now.

2422
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:31,890
I could go to the volcanic area, but I kind of want to check out the goop.

2423
02:26:35,150 --> 02:26:35,910
What's this?

2424
02:26:36,010 --> 02:26:36,270
Oh.

2425
02:26:37,070 --> 02:26:37,990
Enhanced light.

2426
02:26:38,610 --> 02:26:39,590
Do I have to have it equipped?

2427
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:42,370
I guess not.

2428
02:26:49,810 --> 02:26:50,330
Goop.

2429
02:26:51,210 --> 02:26:52,750
It's goopin' time.

2430
02:26:53,690 --> 02:26:54,450
Yep.

2431
02:27:00,410 --> 02:27:02,550
The DLC adds so much.

2432
02:27:03,190 --> 02:27:04,290
I'm kind of shocked.

2433
02:27:06,730 --> 02:27:08,310
At least for the oil rig.

2434
02:27:09,070 --> 02:27:09,670
A wheel!

2435
02:27:11,090 --> 02:27:11,690
Bye bye.

2436
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:13,790
I don't have time.

2437
02:27:14,450 --> 02:27:15,890
We got fish to fry.

2438
02:27:18,810 --> 02:27:19,770
Okay, goop.

2439
02:27:21,450 --> 02:27:23,870
The DLC does have some cool stuff.

2440
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:32,420
We got goop, we got goop.

2441
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:39,530
Oh, I see how it works.

2442
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:47,410
We got whatever that thing is.

2443
02:27:47,810 --> 02:27:48,890
It's cool.

2444
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:49,750
I like it.

2445
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:00,090
I like this guy.

2446
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:06,960
There we go.

2447
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:08,020
More?

2448
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:13,580
Okay, depleted.

2449
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:15,680
We got some goop.

2450
02:28:17,060 --> 02:28:17,480
Discard.

2451
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:18,680
Bye bye.

2452
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:22,020
We don't want him to... I think that might infect it, no?

2453
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:27,200
Is that going to be a big goop bubble?

2454
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:27,980
How do I know?

2455
02:28:28,660 --> 02:28:32,720
How do I know what parts I can fish at?

2456
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:33,960
Here?

2457
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:36,980
Oh yeah, okay.

2458
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:39,600
I'm so bad.

2459
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:43,240
I'm so bad.

2460
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:49,060
Discard.

2461
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:51,080
Discard.

2462
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:56,220
This just seems to be a normal guy, no?

2463
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:00,400
Over here.

2464
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:07,260
Oceanic!

2465
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:08,000
No!

2466
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:13,640
Goop DLC.

2467
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:18,040
I think this is one of the things the guy wanted, maybe?

2468
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:20,580
I might be crazy.

2469
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:22,940
I guess we'll head back and see.

2470
02:29:24,220 --> 02:29:25,580
I don't quite remember.

2471
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:28,320
I don't think he needed a stingray.

2472
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:30,540
If he did, then he's got one.

2473
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:33,960
DLC fish sparkles with an orange glow.

2474
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,260
Grab some of these too.

2475
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:43,940
We'll always sell them, you know?

2476
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:51,500
Back to Mother Base.

2477
02:29:58,520 --> 02:29:59,000
Hello.

2478
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:03,740
Do I need to equip this?

2479
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:06,380
Oh, no?

2480
02:30:12,890 --> 02:30:15,710
Stay back, you misty beast.

2481
02:30:17,150 --> 02:30:18,570
Feed the generator.

2482
02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:19,510
It hungers.

2483
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:22,090
It hungers for the puffy...

2484
02:30:25,770 --> 02:30:28,750
Hungers for the puffy, puffy squid.

2485
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:38,980
What did you want?

2486
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:41,540
I knew it.

2487
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:47,720
I need to buy some crab.

2488
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:51,760
Pots.

2489
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:54,020
Coastal.

2490
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:55,280
Coastal.

2491
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:56,380
Where?

2492
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:57,940
Oh, maybe the other side?

2493
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:05,940
Generator.

2494
02:31:07,420 --> 02:31:08,540
Feed.

2495
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:12,120
Undermarket.

2496
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:15,300
Oh, we got more of these.

2497
02:31:19,220 --> 02:31:21,040
Oh, sorry.

2498
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:21,680
Wait.

2499
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:23,940
Oh, no!

2500
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:25,960
I can't buy crab pots here.

2501
02:31:28,060 --> 02:31:28,800
That's okay.

2502
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:32,400
We gotta head back to the place anyway.

2503
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:33,800
I'm late.

2504
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:34,880
How is the fishing going, boss?

2505
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:35,560
It's great.

2506
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:36,680
We're fishing.

2507
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:39,540
It's already been two and a half hours.

2508
02:31:39,640 --> 02:31:40,840
I feel like it just started.

2509
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:44,500
Gosh, I can really get lost in this game.

2510
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:48,280
Your eyes sparkle truly like sapphires tonight.

2511
02:31:53,960 --> 02:31:54,480
Thanks!

2512
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:58,040
Really reeled me in and got us all hooked.

2513
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:00,600
Wait a second.

2514
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:02,540
We hit up this goop.

2515
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:04,220
Let's go to this goop.

2516
02:32:07,740 --> 02:32:08,180
Bam!

2517
02:32:18,450 --> 02:32:21,070
Memory generator does not pay as well as the fishmonger.

2518
02:32:21,190 --> 02:32:22,130
So if you need money, don't...

2519
02:32:22,130 --> 02:32:23,570
Thank you.

2520
02:32:23,650 --> 02:32:24,190
Good to know.

2521
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:27,730
What does the dark goop taste like?

2522
02:32:27,830 --> 02:32:30,770
Someone said it tastes like a barbecue.

2523
02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:31,850
Wait!

2524
02:32:31,970 --> 02:32:32,750
I think that's a box.

2525
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:36,150
My box senses are tingling.

2526
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:40,750
It's a box!

2527
02:32:43,150 --> 02:32:45,510
And I think I just saw...

2528
02:32:45,510 --> 02:32:47,150
maybe a dog tag.

2529
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:55,410
Two boxes!

2530
02:33:04,870 --> 02:33:05,670
Nice.

2531
02:33:07,170 --> 02:33:08,690
Just a box.

2532
02:33:09,670 --> 02:33:11,270
Is this a dog tag?

2533
02:33:11,410 --> 02:33:12,110
What is this?

2534
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:15,470
Why are you glowing?

2535
02:33:17,850 --> 02:33:18,850
What is this?

2536
02:33:28,010 --> 02:33:29,530
Oh, it's a flag!

2537
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:31,950
A snake flag.

2538
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:34,170
Serpiente.

2539
02:33:35,510 --> 02:33:36,590
Alright, we got our goop.

2540
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:37,970
Wait, this isn't the...

2541
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:39,390
Oh, it is the goop we were going to go to.

2542
02:33:39,850 --> 02:33:40,410
Look at that.

2543
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:42,790
We're too good, you guys.

2544
02:33:43,550 --> 02:33:44,890
We are too good.

2545
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:46,510
Why is this one glowing?

2546
02:33:51,070 --> 02:33:52,310
Are these special fish?

2547
02:33:52,850 --> 02:33:54,690
You guys said it had an orange glow.

2548
02:33:54,970 --> 02:33:55,930
Oh, I see, I see.

2549
02:33:57,250 --> 02:33:58,330
Oh, oceanic.

2550
02:34:01,470 --> 02:34:03,230
You also oceanic?

2551
02:34:04,010 --> 02:34:04,930
No, we can't...

2552
02:34:04,930 --> 02:34:06,130
Oh, but I've gotten this one.

2553
02:34:07,470 --> 02:34:08,170
Dang it.

2554
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:15,860
What the hell is this creature?

2555
02:34:17,540 --> 02:34:17,980
It's...

2556
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,720
Oh, he wants this thing too.

2557
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:22,940
Tolmonstrom.

2558
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:35,220
Sure.

2559
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,420
We go to all you can eat?

2560
02:34:43,710 --> 02:34:45,530
The music got quite spooky, huh?

2561
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:47,590
Oh, sorry, my bad.

2562
02:34:47,810 --> 02:34:49,970
I wanted to do...

2563
02:34:52,530 --> 02:34:57,450
This, and pursuits, and specimens.

2564
02:34:58,050 --> 02:35:00,530
Paddlefish, sea cucumber.

2565
02:35:00,990 --> 02:35:06,450
We gotta go get ourselves a crab pot.

2566
02:35:06,570 --> 02:35:08,650
So let's go do that while we're here.

2567
02:35:17,960 --> 02:35:19,640
Almost missed my turn.

2568
02:35:24,210 --> 02:35:25,710
She said yes.

2569
02:35:26,410 --> 02:35:27,390
Did I?

2570
02:35:27,390 --> 02:35:31,050
People are saying one of the spots had one more box in it, not depleted.

2571
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:33,010
Wait, they are?

2572
02:35:33,930 --> 02:35:34,890
Wait, there was?

2573
02:35:35,430 --> 02:35:36,090
Did I miss it?

2574
02:35:38,090 --> 02:35:38,890
There was?

2575
02:35:43,410 --> 02:35:44,550
Yeah, you left one.

2576
02:35:45,370 --> 02:35:45,850
Oopsie.

2577
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:54,040
Hold on, why did I come here?

2578
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:56,260
Oh, for crab.

2579
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:02,350
Well, you sell the crab, sorry.

2580
02:36:03,050 --> 02:36:03,490
Crab.

2581
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:05,090
Thank you.

2582
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:12,970
We can go back out, even though it's dark and spooky.

2583
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:22,700
You don't think the boat will see me, will it?

2584
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,960
He's coming awfully close.

2585
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:29,660
Turn around.

2586
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:30,660
Thank you.

2587
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:35,520
Not around, not... Turn... Go away!

2588
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:38,540
We are stronger now.

2589
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:47,820
The goop is here.

2590
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:52,060
I'm guessing I have to place the crab in the goop.

2591
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:54,400
Whoa, it's so pink!

2592
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:56,020
Eat.

2593
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:58,020
Crab.

2594
02:36:58,820 --> 02:36:59,040
Drop.

2595
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:04,100
And grab our haste again.

2596
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:08,420
And... I don't remember actually where the...

2597
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:12,820
They were like over... somewhere.

2598
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,760
I actually can't remember.

2599
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:19,340
No, I've already honked at those guys.

2600
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:21,360
You're sickos.

2601
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:23,640
You just want to see me die.

2602
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:30,090
You're all sickos.

2603
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:35,500
You want to see me panic.

2604
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:37,720
Okay, we got that guy.

2605
02:37:38,860 --> 02:37:39,960
And that's oceanic.

2606
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:50,790
So gloopy.

2607
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:53,110
It was...

2608
02:37:56,150 --> 02:37:59,810
I can't quite remember where it was at.

2609
02:38:01,390 --> 02:38:03,010
Oh, to the left.

2610
02:38:03,430 --> 02:38:04,470
Over that way.

2611
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:08,750
Just not into the...

2612
02:38:11,230 --> 02:38:11,990
Mist.

2613
02:38:14,990 --> 02:38:16,930
My muscle box already arrived today.

2614
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:18,990
Oh, I see it!

2615
02:38:19,410 --> 02:38:20,750
Thank you guys.

2616
02:38:20,750 --> 02:38:23,730
I hope you're ready for a Disney World trip this weekend!

2617
02:38:25,710 --> 02:38:27,570
I want to go to Disney!

2618
02:38:30,790 --> 02:38:31,830
Have fun!

2619
02:38:32,630 --> 02:38:34,830
Thanks for taking me with you!

2620
02:38:39,570 --> 02:38:40,410
No, no, no.

2621
02:38:40,650 --> 02:38:41,290
Don't do that.

2622
02:38:43,050 --> 02:38:43,910
Don't do that.

2623
02:38:44,970 --> 02:38:46,110
What if I use this?

2624
02:38:48,650 --> 02:38:50,130
A rat tail.

2625
02:38:50,130 --> 02:38:51,910
Can I fit these guys?

2626
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:56,530
These are a little bigger than I expected.

2627
02:38:58,210 --> 02:38:58,850
One

2628
02:39:07,510 --> 02:39:08,230
moment please.

2629
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:09,670
We can get this guy at least.

2630
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:13,490
Tetris time.

2631
02:39:14,730 --> 02:39:18,330
Boom, baby!

2632
02:39:30,870 --> 02:39:33,230
Yeah, I don't want to hear your funky whispers.

2633
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:38,940
Tetris Pro.

2634
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:43,180
I might be...

2635
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:46,300
I might be a professional.

2636
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:49,400
Wow, guys.

2637
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:52,980
The sunrise on the open sea.

2638
02:40:08,170 --> 02:40:09,090
I

2639
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:33,150
want a view with my boat in it.

2640
02:40:34,030 --> 02:40:35,070
Holy moly!

2641
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:46,340
Catch it!

2642
02:40:56,490 --> 02:40:59,190
Sorry, I thought I had haste.

2643
02:41:00,330 --> 02:41:01,410
Time for me to go.

2644
02:41:09,550 --> 02:41:14,670
I'm pretty sure that was like a random event kind of similar to the...

2645
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:18,730
The whales and stuff, but I think you're gonna need a bigger boat.

2646
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:24,970
That was so neat!

2647
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:30,250
They come out when you're crazy.

2648
02:41:30,470 --> 02:41:30,730
Really?

2649
02:41:31,690 --> 02:41:33,290
It's a random event for crazy?

2650
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:34,550
I'm crazy!

2651
02:41:34,790 --> 02:41:35,790
Oh yeah, I'm pretty crazy.

2652
02:41:37,210 --> 02:41:38,470
How's it going out there?

2653
02:41:39,110 --> 02:41:39,970
Here you go, sir.

2654
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:43,210
Look at this thing's mouth.

2655
02:41:44,950 --> 02:41:46,890
This thing's mouth is so funny.

2656
02:41:47,090 --> 02:41:48,950
We gotta go find a coastal paddle fish.

2657
02:41:53,270 --> 02:41:56,950
Just because we're here though and these guys are big, I will sell them.

2658
02:41:58,730 --> 02:42:01,350
And we'll put our cargo...

2659
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:01,830
Wait a second.

2660
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:03,070
No.

2661
02:42:04,530 --> 02:42:05,310
Not you.

2662
02:42:06,170 --> 02:42:07,090
Tech lab.

2663
02:42:08,890 --> 02:42:10,190
I guess let's do...

2664
02:42:12,530 --> 02:42:13,050
This.

2665
02:42:16,430 --> 02:42:16,950
Instruct.

2666
02:42:17,870 --> 02:42:20,030
I wanna see what tier 2 is.

2667
02:42:27,950 --> 02:42:28,750
Tier 2?

2668
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:31,790
That's done.

2669
02:42:37,130 --> 02:42:39,190
Loch Ness Monster probably.

2670
02:42:39,710 --> 02:42:40,230
Nessie!

2671
02:42:41,030 --> 02:42:44,230
Fun fact, even though it looked like two guys, that was all one creature.

2672
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:54,520
Wait, what?

2673
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:58,120
Sorry, but it is time to see another maid.

2674
02:42:58,440 --> 02:42:59,560
What are you talking about?

2675
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:00,060
What?

2676
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:00,500
What?

2677
02:43:03,860 --> 02:43:05,380
You're seeing other maids?

2678
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:10,300
I'm so confused what's happening.

2679
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:14,500
What's going on?

2680
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:15,840
Traitor.

2681
02:43:15,960 --> 02:43:16,880
Yeah, get his ass.

2682
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:17,880
Get his ass.

2683
02:43:20,500 --> 02:43:22,780
The creature you encountered was a singular creature.

2684
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:23,760
Oh, I thought that.

2685
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:26,620
Yeah, I figured it was one big fish.

2686
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:28,440
Leviathan.

2687
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:32,980
Seeing Emma.

2688
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:36,160
No, don't speak her name around me.

2689
02:43:36,740 --> 02:43:37,700
Oh, here are the samples.

2690
02:43:38,560 --> 02:43:39,740
What was the factory?

2691
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:41,420
Sorry, I'm getting confused what everything is.

2692
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:42,220
Oh, okay, that's right.

2693
02:43:42,780 --> 02:43:45,620
I still have one box, so...

2694
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:50,460
I could always get one of these if I wanted to.

2695
02:43:55,860 --> 02:43:58,900
We'll become uncrazy probably eventually.

2696
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:00,620
Maybe.

2697
02:44:01,320 --> 02:44:03,280
Who knows?

2698
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:07,640
If this is crazy, I don't want to be right.

2699
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:10,780
Wow, big shark.

2700
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:13,940
Come here, come here.

2701
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:23,780
Oh.

2702
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:30,700
Why is it crossed out?

2703
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:32,520
Because it's oceanic, yeah.

2704
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:44,760
What does this do?

2705
02:44:45,820 --> 02:44:46,220
Wow!

2706
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:55,620
Oh my god, it like lights... I mean, it said it lights it up, but I can hold it.

2707
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,280
It's so cool.

2708
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:08,680
Oh my god!

2709
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:13,460
We're getting some crazy encounters right now.

2710
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:17,460
What if I had just gotten... What if I was just right there?

2711
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:21,080
Okay, we gotta go around this.

2712
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:26,720
Get chomped.

2713
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:30,720
Right here.

2714
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:37,620
Surely our thing is bobbing up and down.

2715
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:42,520
That's not good.

2716
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:43,560
That's not good.

2717
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:44,540
What is that?

2718
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:47,140
Oh my god, what is this?

2719
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:48,380
What is that?

2720
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:55,260
What do I do?

2721
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:03,940
What was that?

2722
02:46:09,860 --> 02:46:11,140
Dang it, oh shit.

2723
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:15,740
We need coastal anyway.

2724
02:46:16,540 --> 02:46:17,780
Ooh, fiddler crab.

2725
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:21,880
Please give me what I need, thank you.

2726
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:29,240
That was freaky.

2727
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:32,740
Love how full of evil my shipment of plushies was.

2728
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:34,500
They're really great to eat.

2729
02:46:37,020 --> 02:46:41,720
Please treat your meato plushie with care.

2730
02:46:46,390 --> 02:46:47,430
Oh, we need some explosives.

2731
02:46:47,570 --> 02:46:49,430
Wait, do I have... No, we need some explosives.

2732
02:46:51,610 --> 02:46:52,730
Hot dog indeed.

2733
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:53,590
What's this thing?

2734
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:56,430
Shallow.

2735
02:46:58,770 --> 02:46:59,830
We need some explosives.

2736
02:46:59,970 --> 02:47:01,590
I think that's one of the special parts.

2737
02:47:02,490 --> 02:47:03,170
What are you?

2738
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:07,830
Was this something we needed?

2739
02:47:12,130 --> 02:47:13,670
Oh yes, the battle fish.

2740
02:47:14,110 --> 02:47:14,590
That's it.

2741
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:20,800
I think I can only take one, maybe.

2742
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:21,700
Let's see.

2743
02:47:24,180 --> 02:47:26,260
Perhaps I can finagle two.

2744
02:47:27,280 --> 02:47:29,580
We can probably get two.

2745
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:32,880
May I have fish?

2746
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:34,320
May I have fish?

2747
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:34,680
Thank you.

2748
02:47:42,630 --> 02:47:43,210
Thank you.

2749
02:47:52,090 --> 02:47:54,370
We probably need to sleep tonight.

2750
02:47:57,410 --> 02:47:59,190
What if I don't want to sleep though?

2751
02:47:59,510 --> 02:48:00,630
The ocean calls for me.

2752
02:48:00,670 --> 02:48:01,770
The ocean calls for me.

2753
02:48:01,770 --> 02:48:04,170
The ocean calls for me.

2754
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:07,130
I had to put my meato in the drawer.

2755
02:48:07,330 --> 02:48:08,690
The cat kept running off with her.

2756
02:48:10,550 --> 02:48:14,470
I've never had a cat that would take my plushies or anything like that.

2757
02:48:16,290 --> 02:48:17,570
That's so cute.

2758
02:48:19,610 --> 02:48:22,630
Sell, sell, sell, sell.

2759
02:48:30,770 --> 02:48:32,210
Sell, sell.

2760
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:32,870
Sell, sell.

2761
02:48:37,470 --> 02:48:40,590
We'll put this guy in storage for now.

2762
02:48:43,230 --> 02:48:44,970
That should be fine.

2763
02:48:47,010 --> 02:48:49,830
We have everything, minus the little crab thing.

2764
02:48:49,830 --> 02:48:53,250
And the little sea pickle, I think is what it was.

2765
02:48:57,890 --> 02:48:59,290
Cat, oh she's meato too.

2766
02:48:59,970 --> 02:49:01,350
No one wants to kill me!

2767
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:15,780
Oh, I was going to say it's all cleared up.

2768
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:16,320
Nevermind.

2769
02:49:18,340 --> 02:49:19,800
Let's repair some of these too.

2770
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:21,880
I know this one needs repair.

2771
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:24,100
The other one is small, but we can still repair it.

2772
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:28,760
Or I'll just sell it.

2773
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:30,240
This one right here.

2774
02:49:32,940 --> 02:49:33,820
Pick up.

2775
02:49:34,460 --> 02:49:35,440
We'll sell this one.

2776
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:39,680
Man, I love fish.

2777
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:44,080
I love fish.

2778
02:49:45,440 --> 02:49:46,420
Let's sell this.

2779
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:51,820
I'm so glad people are finally getting their plushies though.

2780
02:49:53,620 --> 02:49:58,370
Happy, happy, happy, happy.

2781
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:05,040
Wait, can I sell you?

2782
02:50:05,320 --> 02:50:06,220
I can't.

2783
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:07,640
Uh oh, nevermind.

2784
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:18,630
I wonder if you can honk to assert dominance now that you have such a massive horn.

2785
02:50:19,870 --> 02:50:21,650
Oh, will hear my horn.

2786
02:50:23,070 --> 02:50:24,450
And cower in fear.

2787
02:50:26,390 --> 02:50:27,330
Uh oh, wait.

2788
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:29,810
He's still fresh.

2789
02:50:31,410 --> 02:50:32,570
We're all good.

2790
02:50:34,450 --> 02:50:37,130
He's like just right out of the package.

2791
02:50:44,740 --> 02:50:46,260
Oh my god.

2792
02:50:48,460 --> 02:50:51,760
I'm going to put another one in this.

2793
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:53,940
Well, it's got to be coastal, right?

2794
02:50:54,320 --> 02:50:56,780
Or no, it doesn't have to be coastal.

2795
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:58,020
Sorry, I was thinking of the other fish.

2796
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:00,680
We'll go put one over here.

2797
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:14,080
I believe these were the pre-order ones.

2798
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:17,920
I'm going to put it right in the center.

2799
02:51:22,450 --> 02:51:23,310
Grab bot.

2800
02:51:23,930 --> 02:51:28,250
Did I check this thing over here?

2801
02:51:31,110 --> 02:51:32,370
I guess I did.

2802
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:39,300
Was there more cloth?

2803
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:41,180
Hold on, I'll go around.

2804
02:51:41,420 --> 02:51:44,160
I don't feel like going through the icky water.

2805
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:53,520
That might be cloth.

2806
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:54,140
No.

2807
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:57,380
It's wood and scrap.

2808
02:52:01,980 --> 02:52:04,160
Oh, it was the SOS guy there.

2809
02:52:06,820 --> 02:52:10,980
Let's go deliver this guy while he's still fresh at least.

2810
02:52:11,540 --> 02:52:13,880
Even though he doesn't necessarily need it to be fresh.

2811
02:52:14,480 --> 02:52:16,020
The guy that cursed me.

2812
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:33,720
So relaxing.

2813
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:34,840
Look at the skies.

2814
02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:36,760
The sunset on the ocean.

2815
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:43,360
Just the waves.

2816
02:52:43,660 --> 02:52:45,820
The sound of waves and my engine.

2817
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:47,380
Nothing else.

2818
02:52:51,440 --> 02:52:56,840
And also the eldritch creature that resides below.

2819
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:01,460
Thank you so much for four months.

2820
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:02,220
Thank you!

2821
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:08,040
And the train sound?

2822
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:08,740
What the heck was that?

2823
02:53:10,740 --> 02:53:15,060
Ok, we just need this little man.

2824
02:53:15,380 --> 02:53:16,500
The sea cucumber.

2825
02:53:17,220 --> 02:53:18,360
Sea cucumber, please!

2826
02:53:18,860 --> 02:53:19,660
Please, please, please!

2827
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:23,420
Arrive.

2828
02:53:27,080 --> 02:53:28,020
Paddle fish.

2829
02:53:30,860 --> 02:53:32,820
What is the purpose of this rig anyway?

2830
02:53:44,060 --> 02:53:44,460
Ok.

2831
02:53:47,900 --> 02:53:49,080
Aren't you going to stop the drill?

2832
02:53:58,020 --> 02:53:58,340
Apparently.

2833
02:53:58,600 --> 02:53:59,180
Apparently.

2834
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:02,960
The drill team will take their time to try and ensure minimal disturbance.

2835
02:54:05,880 --> 02:54:08,240
How does one seek?

2836
02:54:08,820 --> 02:54:09,580
Seek?

2837
02:54:10,500 --> 02:54:11,140
Cucumber.

2838
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:13,380
Cucumber.

2839
02:54:18,890 --> 02:54:25,400
I have to do this so that we can potentially unlock these tier twos.

2840
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:27,760
Let's go to sleep though.

2841
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:30,900
Normally I'd be fine with wandering around.

2842
02:54:32,240 --> 02:54:35,400
But we're trying to get stuff inside our...

2843
02:54:38,420 --> 02:54:42,620
Trying to get stuff inside our traps.

2844
02:54:45,940 --> 02:54:49,620
I don't see cucumbers like spray like...

2845
02:54:50,340 --> 02:54:57,860
When they're trying to escape, when they get scared, don't they like spray like some sort of white gooey substance and it's like...

2846
02:54:57,860 --> 02:54:59,860
It's icky and gross.

2847
02:55:05,740 --> 02:55:07,240
Or am I thinking of something else?

2848
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:10,860
They vomit their own intestines.

2849
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:11,620
Wait, hold on.

2850
02:55:11,640 --> 02:55:15,760
Sorry, my chat froze up once again.

2851
02:55:16,900 --> 02:55:18,480
That's their guts.

2852
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:20,120
Oh, nasty.

2853
02:55:21,700 --> 02:55:22,880
That's really their guts?

2854
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:23,840
Wow.

2855
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:35,540
Is it not on a whitish color?

2856
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:50,060
They purge their innards.

2857
02:55:52,640 --> 02:55:53,540
What?

2858
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:55,000
What?

2859
02:55:55,800 --> 02:55:57,060
Mork, right?

2860
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:00,840
Wait, is this the one that I missed actually?

2861
02:56:01,440 --> 02:56:04,060
So I totally found a completely unrelated one before.

2862
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:05,300
That's so funny.

2863
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:07,660
Unless this respawned.

2864
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:09,560
I don't think it... Wait, there's more!

2865
02:56:18,740 --> 02:56:19,400
I can't tell.

2866
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:20,520
They do respawn.

2867
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:22,820
That would be so funny.

2868
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:25,940
I

2869
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:38,000
know you might be excited about potential collaborations and of course...

2870
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:45,000
I would love to collaborate with many, many people but please try to remember the rules about not bringing up other Vtubers.

2871
02:56:45,660 --> 02:56:47,960
Why is it all these common crabs?

2872
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:51,240
Why?

2873
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:02,810
Why all just common crab?

2874
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:05,650
I'm getting so unlucky.

2875
02:57:06,450 --> 02:57:08,310
Unless I'm just not putting it in the correct place.

2876
02:57:09,330 --> 02:57:12,750
Now we have some more cloth, baby.

2877
02:57:13,630 --> 02:57:14,610
Let's go.

2878
02:57:18,370 --> 02:57:18,950
Depleted.

2879
02:57:29,700 --> 02:57:30,280
No!

2880
02:57:31,380 --> 02:57:31,720
No!

2881
02:57:34,100 --> 02:57:34,680
Discard.

2882
02:57:36,740 --> 02:57:38,560
Wait, this one's not even...

2883
02:57:39,940 --> 02:57:41,320
We got the sea kookaburra!

2884
02:57:41,560 --> 02:57:43,140
Sorry, I don't know why I keep pressing escape.

2885
02:57:46,780 --> 02:57:48,580
I got a trophy for it.

2886
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:53,380
Actually, I will do this one.

2887
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:54,740
Why not?

2888
02:57:55,020 --> 02:57:55,960
We can get some money.

2889
02:57:57,500 --> 02:57:58,020
There it is.

2890
02:57:59,460 --> 02:58:00,280
Let's go!

2891
02:58:09,820 --> 02:58:10,300
No!

2892
02:58:21,460 --> 02:58:22,700
It doesn't help.

2893
02:58:23,020 --> 02:58:23,660
It doesn't help.

2894
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:27,120
Okay, good to know.

2895
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:31,380
Dang it, I thought the light would be like...

2896
02:58:31,980 --> 02:58:33,560
And like, get rid of it, you know?

2897
02:58:41,170 --> 02:58:43,170
Light attracts cursed mist.

2898
02:58:45,070 --> 02:58:45,590
No!

2899
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:45,850
No!

2900
02:58:45,850 --> 02:58:46,090
No!

2901
02:58:46,090 --> 02:58:46,330
No!

2902
02:58:46,330 --> 02:58:46,510
No!

2903
02:58:46,510 --> 02:58:47,010
No!

2904
02:58:47,010 --> 02:58:47,210
No!

2905
02:58:48,510 --> 02:58:49,070
Please!

2906
02:58:49,650 --> 02:58:49,850
No!

2907
02:58:49,930 --> 02:58:50,310
I'm crazy!

2908
02:58:50,430 --> 02:58:50,790
I'm crazy!

2909
02:58:50,890 --> 02:58:51,230
I'm crazy!

2910
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:51,690
I'm crazy!

2911
02:58:51,970 --> 02:58:52,390
I'm crazy!

2912
02:58:54,970 --> 02:58:55,530
I'm crazy!

2913
02:58:55,530 --> 02:59:00,290
Oh my god.

2914
02:59:02,470 --> 02:59:02,870
Okay!

2915
02:59:03,730 --> 02:59:05,090
The scientist looks taken back.

2916
02:59:05,190 --> 02:59:08,730
He consults some papers on his desk, then leaves through an old encyclopedia.

2917
02:59:09,230 --> 02:59:10,010
This is remarkable.

2918
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:12,050
Some of these species... Have you caught these before?

2919
02:59:12,210 --> 02:59:15,550
They haven't been seen outside the fossil record since, well, ever.

2920
02:59:16,030 --> 02:59:17,870
I suppose it could make sense.

2921
02:59:17,950 --> 02:59:23,750
The fish are opening, cause some kind of disturbance in the deep, possibly spooking some of these fish up the water column.

2922
02:59:30,290 --> 02:59:31,770
I'll run some tests on these.

2923
02:59:31,990 --> 02:59:35,990
The scientist is interrupted by the foreman outside, shouting through his megaphone again.

2924
02:59:36,310 --> 02:59:38,310
The foreman below bellows in order.

2925
02:59:39,130 --> 02:59:40,330
Engage reverse gear!

2926
02:59:40,510 --> 02:59:42,090
Get that drill outta there!

2927
02:59:47,750 --> 02:59:49,690
This doesn't seem very good, I think.

2928
02:59:50,130 --> 02:59:50,510
No?

2929
02:59:51,030 --> 02:59:52,250
This seems bad?

2930
02:59:53,010 --> 02:59:54,190
I think this is bad.

2931
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:04,470
Oh no!

2932
03:00:04,710 --> 03:00:05,390
Not inside!

2933
03:00:07,450 --> 03:00:09,070
Ah, hell.

2934
03:00:09,290 --> 03:00:09,870
That's enough.

2935
03:00:09,950 --> 03:00:10,570
Drill is clear.

2936
03:00:10,670 --> 03:00:12,190
I repeat, drill is clear.

2937
03:00:12,370 --> 03:00:13,190
Shut it down.

2938
03:00:14,030 --> 03:00:16,670
As I was saying, I'll run some quick tests on these specimens.

2939
03:00:17,430 --> 03:00:20,570
Though, from the sounds of things, you may have some additional samples to gather.

2940
03:00:21,290 --> 03:00:23,870
It seems the reservoir is more unstable than we anticipated.

2941
03:00:24,270 --> 03:00:27,470
Even with the drill removed, it appears the fissure is continuing to expand.

2942
03:00:28,510 --> 03:00:34,590
Unfortunately, there have been reports of some contaminants leaking from the fissure in isolated pockets.

2943
03:00:35,570 --> 03:00:37,570
There was always a chance this might happen.

2944
03:00:37,750 --> 03:00:41,590
The engineer at the factory has been working on a system to siphon such contaminants from the water.

2945
03:00:42,130 --> 03:00:43,650
I'd very much like a canister of it.

2946
03:00:44,210 --> 03:00:44,710
Oh, ok.

2947
03:00:45,090 --> 03:00:47,990
I've been trying to keep a record of where all that dark liquid has been showing up.

2948
03:00:49,030 --> 03:00:51,710
Come see me if you need pointing to any contamination patches.

2949
03:00:52,910 --> 03:00:54,070
Alright.

2950
03:00:55,050 --> 03:00:57,150
Yeah, they're totally isolated.

2951
03:00:57,290 --> 03:00:58,190
It's fine.

2952
03:00:59,770 --> 03:01:00,790
Tier 2.

2953
03:01:01,310 --> 03:01:02,430
Material gathering.

2954
03:01:03,310 --> 03:01:05,030
Let's get to work.

2955
03:01:06,910 --> 03:01:11,750
The factory's core facilities have been improved.

2956
03:01:13,590 --> 03:01:15,470
Siphon trawler.

2957
03:01:17,810 --> 03:01:19,710
For dredge?

2958
03:01:21,750 --> 03:01:25,450
Once deployed, this trap expands into a larger formation.

2959
03:01:28,090 --> 03:01:29,970
Filtered fluid in canisters.

2960
03:01:33,250 --> 03:01:34,810
I see.

2961
03:01:35,570 --> 03:01:37,030
Someone collects dredge!

2962
03:01:37,070 --> 03:01:38,070
That's huge!

2963
03:01:39,110 --> 03:01:40,750
You want the siphon trawler?

2964
03:01:46,020 --> 03:01:48,640
Yeah, we can passively gather materials.

2965
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:51,480
Let's...

2966
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:54,440
What do I need?

2967
03:01:54,680 --> 03:01:55,940
The basic trawl net.

2968
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:57,780
Obviously I don't have that.

2969
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:59,040
Oh my gosh, our thing is full.

2970
03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:03,000
Not full, but, you know, lots of good stuff in there.

2971
03:02:04,700 --> 03:02:06,360
Which I will sell to the generator.

2972
03:02:07,640 --> 03:02:08,020
Eat up!

2973
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:25,700
I wonder what tier 2 is, though.

2974
03:02:28,220 --> 03:02:30,540
Do the starting extension on the building soon.

2975
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:31,420
Oh, good!

2976
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:35,040
Ok, construct.

2977
03:02:37,920 --> 03:02:39,560
We can get more upgrades.

2978
03:02:40,700 --> 03:02:42,280
The tech lab is fully built now.

2979
03:02:42,760 --> 03:02:43,420
Let's see what's this.

2980
03:02:45,220 --> 03:02:46,340
Turning speed!

2981
03:02:48,580 --> 03:02:49,640
Reverse gear!

2982
03:02:51,380 --> 03:02:52,500
Chain optimizer.

2983
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:55,840
Increases the winching speed of your dredge crane.

2984
03:02:56,920 --> 03:02:57,440
What does that mean?

2985
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:01,660
I mean though, please don't fish and eat me.

2986
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:03,120
I don't eat.

2987
03:03:03,720 --> 03:03:04,380
I sell.

2988
03:03:08,300 --> 03:03:09,860
You dredge faster.

2989
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:18,500
We don't have any boxes though, so...

2990
03:03:20,860 --> 03:03:23,100
Boost the reverse speed of your vessel.

2991
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:27,480
Wait, so increases the pulling power of your fishing reels.

2992
03:03:28,520 --> 03:03:30,540
Fishing speed, heat absorption.

2993
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:35,380
Troll catch rate.

2994
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:36,660
I like that too.

2995
03:03:37,240 --> 03:03:38,920
Wait, I like all of these.

2996
03:03:40,680 --> 03:03:42,840
I'm guessing these are like passive.

2997
03:03:44,740 --> 03:03:45,080
Um...

2998
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:47,840
Passive, like uh...

2999
03:03:50,840 --> 03:03:51,180
Enhancements?

3000
03:03:54,140 --> 03:03:54,480
Yeah?

3001
03:03:55,060 --> 03:03:56,640
So I don't have to like attach them in here?

3002
03:03:56,900 --> 03:03:57,820
Is what I'm trying to say.

3003
03:03:58,780 --> 03:04:00,900
Oh, you put them on the boat and it gives you a bonus.

3004
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:01,700
It's stackable.

3005
03:04:01,880 --> 03:04:02,780
Oh, ok.

3006
03:04:03,760 --> 03:04:04,900
They take up inventory.

3007
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:06,160
Oh, ok, ok, ok, ok.

3008
03:04:06,320 --> 03:04:07,340
So that's what I was wondering.

3009
03:04:07,480 --> 03:04:07,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3010
03:04:10,640 --> 03:04:11,320
Ok, um...

3011
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:11,820
That's what I meant.

3012
03:04:11,880 --> 03:04:13,000
Sorry, that's what I meant by passive.

3013
03:04:13,180 --> 03:04:14,460
Sorry, that's probably the wrong word.

3014
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:18,320
Yeah, ice, but...

3015
03:04:20,400 --> 03:04:23,620
Ok, I like turning speed a whole lot.

3016
03:04:26,300 --> 03:04:27,760
These are good upgrades.

3017
03:04:29,940 --> 03:04:31,060
What do you want now?

3018
03:04:31,320 --> 03:04:32,080
Oh, the samples.

3019
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:34,060
So let's go.

3020
03:04:36,660 --> 03:04:38,280
Let's get this.

3021
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:40,680
I need the basic trawl net.

3022
03:04:40,800 --> 03:04:42,220
So I'm gonna...

3023
03:04:42,220 --> 03:04:43,200
Undermark it.

3024
03:04:43,300 --> 03:04:44,320
Grab that.

3025
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:47,260
Basic trawl net.

3026
03:04:51,580 --> 03:04:52,100
Factory.

3027
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:56,800
Oh, I don't have a box!

3028
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:57,560
No!

3029
03:04:57,880 --> 03:04:58,500
I need a box!

3030
03:04:58,700 --> 03:04:58,840
Ok.

3031
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:00,400
You know what?

3032
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:00,780
Screw it.

3033
03:05:00,820 --> 03:05:01,780
I'm just gonna buy one.

3034
03:05:01,780 --> 03:05:02,240
Haha.

3035
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:07,080
It's ok.

3036
03:05:07,460 --> 03:05:08,420
We'll get more, guys.

3037
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:09,400
We'll get more cloth.

3038
03:05:09,540 --> 03:05:11,040
It regenerates every couple days.

3039
03:05:12,600 --> 03:05:13,620
Oh, I had one.

3040
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:14,880
I'm such an idiot.

3041
03:05:20,040 --> 03:05:20,440
No!

3042
03:05:21,260 --> 03:05:21,860
You know what?

3043
03:05:21,860 --> 03:05:22,160
That's ok.

3044
03:05:22,480 --> 03:05:23,080
You guys, that's ok.

3045
03:05:23,160 --> 03:05:23,460
That's ok.

3046
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:29,040
That's ok, because we can get this, too.

3047
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:34,680
We'll get this.

3048
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:36,760
Can I keep it in my storage and it works?

3049
03:05:36,840 --> 03:05:40,400
Or do I have to have it on my cargo?

3050
03:05:50,840 --> 03:05:51,820
In the boat.

3051
03:05:55,700 --> 03:05:56,200
So...

3052
03:05:56,200 --> 03:05:57,240
Not storage.

3053
03:05:58,680 --> 03:05:59,680
Is what you're saying.

3054
03:06:11,820 --> 03:06:13,440
Equip the siphon trawler.

3055
03:06:18,160 --> 03:06:20,080
You have to equip it.

3056
03:06:23,020 --> 03:06:24,280
Wait, where did it just go?

3057
03:06:24,820 --> 03:06:24,960
Oh.

3058
03:06:25,460 --> 03:06:27,740
So like, down here it will work.

3059
03:06:34,980 --> 03:06:35,440
Yes.

3060
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:35,960
Ok.

3061
03:06:37,220 --> 03:06:38,220
Good, good, good.

3062
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:41,520
Oh wait!

3063
03:06:41,820 --> 03:06:42,320
My fish!

3064
03:06:43,040 --> 03:06:44,000
I sold all of them, right?

3065
03:06:45,140 --> 03:06:46,100
I can't remember.

3066
03:06:46,380 --> 03:06:47,040
I think I did.

3067
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:48,580
To the generator?

3068
03:06:49,280 --> 03:06:50,460
I'm pretty sure I did.

3069
03:06:50,720 --> 03:06:50,920
Ok.

3070
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:54,140
Alright, let's sleep.

3071
03:06:56,200 --> 03:06:57,960
And let's go get some goo!

3072
03:06:58,740 --> 03:06:59,780
It's gooping time!

3073
03:07:05,380 --> 03:07:07,120
It's gooping time!

3074
03:07:10,970 --> 03:07:12,630
Let's goop it up!

3075
03:07:12,810 --> 03:07:13,010
Yeah!

3076
03:07:14,030 --> 03:07:15,810
I'm ready to goop!

3077
03:07:17,490 --> 03:07:18,290
Yes!

3078
03:07:19,090 --> 03:07:20,630
Good morning, goop!

3079
03:07:21,190 --> 03:07:22,110
Goop morning!

3080
03:07:25,430 --> 03:07:27,270
Goop morning, Minto.

3081
03:07:32,030 --> 03:07:33,710
Oh gosh, almost 9AM.

3082
03:07:33,850 --> 03:07:35,310
That's the perfect time to goop.

3083
03:07:38,010 --> 03:07:40,710
I love me a 9AM gooping.

3084
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:48,480
Here we go.

3085
03:07:52,450 --> 03:07:53,250
Alright.

3086
03:08:05,580 --> 03:08:07,320
Oh my god.

3087
03:08:07,720 --> 03:08:08,180
Wait!

3088
03:08:09,440 --> 03:08:11,240
Oh I get to eat it up!

3089
03:08:22,220 --> 03:08:24,080
I missed a spot.

3090
03:08:34,860 --> 03:08:36,660
No goop in there yet though.

3091
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:44,020
Will I still be able to get the goopy fish though?

3092
03:08:44,460 --> 03:08:45,160
The cleansing.

3093
03:08:46,180 --> 03:08:48,600
Like the fish that are in the goop?

3094
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:49,800
Does it matter?

3095
03:08:51,540 --> 03:08:51,840
Yeah?

3096
03:08:52,120 --> 03:08:52,320
Ok.

3097
03:08:57,520 --> 03:09:00,420
Oh my gosh, we're keeping the oceans clean everybody!

3098
03:09:03,780 --> 03:09:06,340
Good thing I got that easier...

3099
03:09:10,860 --> 03:09:12,040
easier turn.

3100
03:09:25,530 --> 03:09:27,070
I'm cleaning the ocean.

3101
03:09:28,990 --> 03:09:30,070
Goop soup.

3102
03:09:30,990 --> 03:09:34,070
So I guess once it's filled, we'll have a...

3103
03:09:34,590 --> 03:09:36,270
a goop...

3104
03:09:36,270 --> 03:09:37,130
amount.

3105
03:09:51,110 --> 03:09:53,510
Of course I'm gonna get all of it though.

3106
03:09:59,190 --> 03:10:02,050
I feel I can probably turn off my light here.

3107
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:04,030
While we're working on this.

3108
03:10:04,550 --> 03:10:06,090
Even though I can't see very well.

3109
03:10:07,490 --> 03:10:09,750
I think the mist will annoy me otherwise.

3110
03:10:11,130 --> 03:10:12,110
I'm working.

3111
03:10:12,250 --> 03:10:14,170
I'm actually doing a job right now.

3112
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:17,530
I'm actually doing my maidly duties of cleaning.

3113
03:10:21,870 --> 03:10:24,450
I'm actually cleaning at the moment.

3114
03:10:27,090 --> 03:10:30,410
Straight up gooping it on stream, freaky style.

3115
03:10:32,050 --> 03:10:34,150
Thank you so much for the tag gifted!

3116
03:10:34,290 --> 03:10:35,030
Thank you!

3117
03:10:35,910 --> 03:10:37,190
Thank you, thank you.

3118
03:10:38,510 --> 03:10:39,110
Ok.

3119
03:10:39,750 --> 03:10:40,770
Did I get all that goop?

3120
03:10:41,370 --> 03:10:42,450
Seems like it.

3121
03:10:44,230 --> 03:10:44,730
Hey!

3122
03:10:46,090 --> 03:10:46,950
Stop it!

3123
03:10:48,650 --> 03:10:50,370
I turned you off.

3124
03:10:52,570 --> 03:10:53,670
What are those?

3125
03:10:57,530 --> 03:10:59,310
What is that thing over there?

3126
03:10:59,850 --> 03:11:01,470
What is that thing with the eyes?

3127
03:11:01,650 --> 03:11:01,910
Wait.

3128
03:11:03,050 --> 03:11:04,790
What the hell is that?

3129
03:11:08,450 --> 03:11:10,030
There's several of them.

3130
03:11:21,940 --> 03:11:23,720
What is that?

3131
03:11:24,480 --> 03:11:25,440
That's new.

3132
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:29,360
Hi!

3133
03:11:32,620 --> 03:11:33,420
What are you?

3134
03:11:34,680 --> 03:11:35,260
What are you?

3135
03:11:35,260 --> 03:11:35,760
Ah!

3136
03:11:38,040 --> 03:11:38,440
Oh.

3137
03:11:38,660 --> 03:11:39,140
Oh my god.

3138
03:11:43,040 --> 03:11:43,840
It disappeared.

3139
03:11:43,960 --> 03:11:45,460
It doesn't care about me I guess.

3140
03:11:45,880 --> 03:11:46,860
Just a little guy.

3141
03:11:47,360 --> 03:11:48,400
He's just a little gooper.

3142
03:11:51,380 --> 03:11:54,240
He's like, I also enjoy a good goop.

3143
03:11:56,900 --> 03:11:57,960
Where is all the goop there?

3144
03:11:57,960 --> 03:11:58,600
Oh.

3145
03:12:09,390 --> 03:12:10,050
Yeah.

3146
03:12:17,240 --> 03:12:17,900
Yeah.

3147
03:12:19,160 --> 03:12:19,600
Yeah.

3148
03:12:22,160 --> 03:12:24,020
I can't get this thing yet.

3149
03:12:27,440 --> 03:12:28,760
Did I miss a spot?

3150
03:12:31,660 --> 03:12:33,160
24 hour gooping.

3151
03:12:33,280 --> 03:12:35,440
It's a, it's a, it's a, you know.

3152
03:12:36,240 --> 03:12:39,360
It's, it's a tough job but someone's gotta do it.

3153
03:12:41,480 --> 03:12:43,480
Someone's gotta goop in the middle of the night.

3154
03:12:45,440 --> 03:12:47,040
I'm a goop sweeper.

3155
03:12:48,820 --> 03:12:51,440
Yeah, put me on that show, Dirty Jobs or whatever.

3156
03:12:55,900 --> 03:12:56,780
So that's...

3157
03:12:57,660 --> 03:12:58,400
What's that sound?

3158
03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:01,560
Oh, it's just a little guy.

3159
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:03,360
It's just a little...

3160
03:13:04,940 --> 03:13:07,380
Yeah, we're fine.

3161
03:13:07,380 --> 03:13:08,700
Look, it's almost daytime.

3162
03:13:09,400 --> 03:13:10,640
Starting to lighten up a little.

3163
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:14,700
We've been gooping all night.

3164
03:13:15,120 --> 03:13:16,600
Wait, do these things show up on the goop?

3165
03:13:22,600 --> 03:13:24,120
Your gooping days are over!

3166
03:13:25,460 --> 03:13:27,280
Your gooping days are over!

3167
03:13:33,640 --> 03:13:35,840
I literally gooped all night, you guys.

3168
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:37,500
Oh!

3169
03:13:38,100 --> 03:13:38,580
Oh!

3170
03:13:38,800 --> 03:13:39,280
Oh!

3171
03:13:43,900 --> 03:13:45,280
Oh, it's an evil one!

3172
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:47,160
It's coming directly for me!

3173
03:13:47,460 --> 03:13:48,340
It wants me!

3174
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:50,500
Why are you so obsessed with me, please?

3175
03:13:53,880 --> 03:13:55,560
Let me do my job!

3176
03:13:56,820 --> 03:13:58,700
Oh my gosh, I missed a single spot.

3177
03:14:03,320 --> 03:14:05,080
This thing stays out even in the...

3178
03:14:05,080 --> 03:14:05,300
Oh!

3179
03:14:08,220 --> 03:14:10,100
Oh my gosh, did you guys see that?

3180
03:14:11,380 --> 03:14:12,320
That was pretty awesome.

3181
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:15,360
That was pretty good.

3182
03:14:15,440 --> 03:14:16,360
That was pretty good.

3183
03:14:20,420 --> 03:14:21,260
That's not good.

3184
03:14:21,420 --> 03:14:22,140
That's not good.

3185
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:23,340
Oh, that's not good.

3186
03:14:37,800 --> 03:14:38,280
Anyway...

3187
03:14:40,720 --> 03:14:41,200
Anyway...

3188
03:14:41,200 --> 03:14:43,380
Lighten up all the goop still.

3189
03:14:43,660 --> 03:14:44,420
All the goop.

3190
03:14:44,460 --> 03:14:45,360
I like this part.

3191
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:47,140
Oh, my...

3192
03:14:47,140 --> 03:14:48,820
What you got in there?

3193
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:51,740
Thank you.

3194
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:54,180
Oh, my hole is pretty damaged.

3195
03:15:00,110 --> 03:15:01,450
What's wrong with my vision?

3196
03:15:01,550 --> 03:15:01,870
What's wrong?

3197
03:15:05,530 --> 03:15:07,630
Something slithers into your cargo hold.

3198
03:15:09,110 --> 03:15:09,590
No!

3199
03:15:09,750 --> 03:15:10,970
We got an infected guy!

3200
03:15:11,690 --> 03:15:12,530
I'm gonna get rid of him.

3201
03:15:18,180 --> 03:15:19,560
My what was damaged?

3202
03:15:19,700 --> 03:15:20,140
My hole?

3203
03:15:22,580 --> 03:15:24,220
What did you think I said?

3204
03:15:34,780 --> 03:15:35,940
We're almost done.

3205
03:15:36,940 --> 03:15:38,460
We've almost cleared the goop, guys.

3206
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:39,680
We've almost cleared the goop.

3207
03:15:40,420 --> 03:15:42,020
Oh, what just happened?

3208
03:15:47,080 --> 03:15:49,200
Oh, it's probably broken.

3209
03:15:55,560 --> 03:15:56,640
Missing item.

3210
03:16:09,630 --> 03:16:11,230
My gooping days are over.

3211
03:16:11,350 --> 03:16:12,610
We were so close.

3212
03:16:13,310 --> 03:16:15,430
And that, I feel like, was a smaller area.

3213
03:16:16,410 --> 03:16:19,090
This area over there seems huge.

3214
03:16:20,510 --> 03:16:22,850
It's gonna take forever to get all that goop.

3215
03:16:29,800 --> 03:16:31,980
I gooped too high.

3216
03:16:39,540 --> 03:16:41,660
The birds, are they good birds?

3217
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:42,500
Oh, they're bad birds.

3218
03:16:43,320 --> 03:16:43,560
No!

3219
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:44,900
They're taking my crabs!

3220
03:16:46,360 --> 03:16:46,620
No!

3221
03:16:47,060 --> 03:16:47,840
I worked hard for that.

3222
03:16:48,640 --> 03:16:49,040
No!

3223
03:16:49,940 --> 03:16:51,580
My engine!

3224
03:16:54,460 --> 03:16:56,320
Stop, please!

3225
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:09,160
No!

3226
03:17:09,640 --> 03:17:10,840
I want them to get them away.

3227
03:17:10,960 --> 03:17:11,140
OK.

3228
03:17:12,220 --> 03:17:14,000
I stayed crazy the whole day.

3229
03:17:15,440 --> 03:17:17,900
It's because I can't stop thinking about goop.

3230
03:17:18,480 --> 03:17:19,940
I'm like...

3231
03:17:22,660 --> 03:17:24,060
Return canister.

3232
03:17:24,740 --> 03:17:27,520
Have you collected the containment I have?

3233
03:17:28,680 --> 03:17:30,100
He holds it up to the light.

3234
03:17:30,200 --> 03:17:35,700
For a moment, the fluorescent bulbs in the room flicker and buzz, light recoiling in a pattern against the ceiling.

3235
03:17:36,800 --> 03:17:37,280
Thank you.

3236
03:17:37,360 --> 03:17:41,880
It's always important to know what we're dealing with in operations such as these.

3237
03:17:43,160 --> 03:17:45,140
You'll go blind if you goop too much, you know.

3238
03:17:50,780 --> 03:17:52,500
It's just a little radioactive.

3239
03:17:52,500 --> 03:17:56,960
If you saw anything noteworthy about the liquid, he doesn't let on.

3240
03:17:57,720 --> 03:18:00,200
Don't forget about that other thing I asked you to do.

3241
03:18:01,180 --> 03:18:03,720
Have you had time to... Wait, when did you ask me to get these?

3242
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:07,480
What?

3243
03:18:07,960 --> 03:18:09,000
Excuse me, sir.

3244
03:18:09,620 --> 03:18:10,640
When did you say that?

3245
03:18:15,620 --> 03:18:16,100
What?

3246
03:18:16,320 --> 03:18:17,540
When did he say this?

3247
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:22,960
Do you know anything about these mutated fish I've been finding?

3248
03:18:24,620 --> 03:18:28,380
Mutations are present in almost all species, and fish are certainly no exception.

3249
03:18:28,860 --> 03:18:32,200
In my years of study, I've seen fish with extra fins, eyes, and even heads.

3250
03:18:33,100 --> 03:18:36,340
Yes, they're a relatively normal part of the development of a species.

3251
03:18:36,800 --> 03:18:41,540
Occasionally, they can be influenced by external factors, and only in exceptional circumstances.

3252
03:18:43,500 --> 03:18:45,760
What's going to happen to the fisher that opened up?

3253
03:18:45,760 --> 03:18:48,740
Now that the drill has withdrawn, it should settle down.

3254
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:51,640
Provided nothing else disturbs the seabed.

3255
03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:54,740
Yeah, this is gaslighting.

3256
03:18:55,400 --> 03:18:57,120
I think we're being gaslit.

3257
03:18:57,920 --> 03:19:01,780
I think we're part of some secret... I don't know.

3258
03:19:02,380 --> 03:19:04,160
I feel like the gulp... The gulp?

3259
03:19:04,420 --> 03:19:04,680
Sorry.

3260
03:19:07,360 --> 03:19:10,000
I combined the gulp and the government.

3261
03:19:17,340 --> 03:19:18,760
I was gonna...

3262
03:19:24,240 --> 03:19:25,600
The colt?

3263
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:27,200
I almost did it again.

3264
03:19:27,260 --> 03:19:34,040
The colt and the government are fighting against each other for these freaky fish.

3265
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:39,460
Oh my gosh.

3266
03:19:39,500 --> 03:19:41,500
This is how my brain works, you guys.

3267
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:46,600
I literally combined colt, so I said gult.

3268
03:19:47,380 --> 03:19:49,580
Because I said government and colt.

3269
03:19:58,260 --> 03:20:00,460
Anyway, now that the drill has withdrawn...

3270
03:20:00,460 --> 03:20:01,500
Oh, maybe not the government.

3271
03:20:01,620 --> 03:20:02,840
I guess this company, huh?

3272
03:20:04,780 --> 03:20:08,280
I expect that given enough time, it will be filled with sediment entirely.

3273
03:20:08,280 --> 03:20:12,300
In the meantime, it appears to have opened up some interesting opportunities for research.

3274
03:20:12,840 --> 03:20:14,040
You silly goop.

3275
03:20:17,640 --> 03:20:21,640
Please repair my $160 for repairs.

3276
03:20:24,200 --> 03:20:27,220
Wait, they took my sea crab and everything.

3277
03:20:29,040 --> 03:20:31,780
Oh man, we got no money.

3278
03:20:33,720 --> 03:20:35,340
Gooping with the gult.

3279
03:20:47,300 --> 03:20:48,600
Back to gooping.

3280
03:20:53,500 --> 03:20:53,920
Oh wait.

3281
03:20:55,460 --> 03:20:57,100
Do they still need the goop?

3282
03:21:02,600 --> 03:21:06,980
They're working for big BP colt oil government goop.

3283
03:21:07,100 --> 03:21:07,960
What does that mean?

3284
03:21:14,910 --> 03:21:18,570
I know that there's some like here, right?

3285
03:21:18,710 --> 03:21:19,870
That like requires...

3286
03:21:21,330 --> 03:21:23,870
Yeah, some of these require it.

3287
03:21:36,410 --> 03:21:42,930
I wonder if having the dredge material, like the harvester would be good because...

3288
03:21:48,280 --> 03:21:51,680
Because then we could start collecting stuff for the big...

3289
03:21:55,310 --> 03:21:57,510
Well, we gotta go to... What do you want?

3290
03:21:57,670 --> 03:21:58,350
What do you want?

3291
03:21:59,110 --> 03:22:02,490
You want a land set fish?

3292
03:22:05,330 --> 03:22:08,530
Trilobite, Nautilus, and Solacena.

3293
03:22:10,830 --> 03:22:11,510
Oceanic.

3294
03:22:11,610 --> 03:22:13,550
Oh, I do need an oceanic one though.

3295
03:22:14,090 --> 03:22:16,490
Okay, we gotta update our...

3296
03:22:17,490 --> 03:22:20,770
We do have to get a different rod at least.

3297
03:22:21,830 --> 03:22:22,830
Coastal shallow.

3298
03:22:25,770 --> 03:22:27,030
Infused hoist.

3299
03:22:28,470 --> 03:22:31,190
Actually, let's get the infused winch.

3300
03:22:32,490 --> 03:22:34,730
But I need a hydraulic rod.

3301
03:22:37,210 --> 03:22:39,630
Bunch of creepy crawlies, pretty much.

3302
03:22:39,950 --> 03:22:43,770
But I need the hydraulic.

3303
03:22:44,490 --> 03:22:45,590
Gosh, it's so expensive.

3304
03:22:48,270 --> 03:22:49,910
I should have never sold them earlier.

3305
03:22:51,090 --> 03:22:51,850
I guess.

3306
03:22:53,250 --> 03:22:55,230
And we need to go get a box.

3307
03:22:59,390 --> 03:23:00,770
Let's go find a box.

3308
03:23:04,770 --> 03:23:07,070
Maybe one has respawned by now.

3309
03:23:08,890 --> 03:23:13,690
Yeah, we're gonna get the bigger boat pretty soon-ish, I hope.

3310
03:23:15,770 --> 03:23:17,790
That's also kind of a goal.

3311
03:23:18,930 --> 03:23:22,710
Get some more, you know, some more...

3312
03:23:26,630 --> 03:23:28,370
Some more cloth.

3313
03:23:28,370 --> 03:23:28,670
Cloth.

3314
03:23:30,750 --> 03:23:31,990
Box hole!

3315
03:23:49,470 --> 03:23:50,310
Nice.

3316
03:23:53,250 --> 03:23:57,470
There might be some...

3317
03:23:58,170 --> 03:23:59,990
Cloth respawn.

3318
03:24:01,530 --> 03:24:03,590
Not yet, sad.

3319
03:24:05,250 --> 03:24:06,710
Sad, sad, sad.

3320
03:24:16,790 --> 03:24:21,650
I wanna see how close we are to getting the upgrade, though.

3321
03:24:22,810 --> 03:24:25,230
Wait, I thought the stuff spread all through here.

3322
03:24:26,190 --> 03:24:26,370
No?

3323
03:24:28,010 --> 03:24:28,750
Did it not?

3324
03:24:29,310 --> 03:24:30,110
I thought it did.

3325
03:24:41,990 --> 03:24:44,070
The dredge net, see how it works.

3326
03:24:44,230 --> 03:24:44,610
True.

3327
03:24:46,090 --> 03:24:47,110
Yeah, I could get it now.

3328
03:24:51,560 --> 03:24:52,860
Here, that's what I was looking for.

3329
03:24:53,540 --> 03:24:55,660
Oh, just one cloth is what we need.

3330
03:24:55,840 --> 03:24:56,320
Okay, cool.

3331
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:58,020
We can upgrade this to them.

3332
03:25:01,100 --> 03:25:02,880
And then we need three cloth.

3333
03:25:04,880 --> 03:25:07,460
Okay, more rod.

3334
03:25:08,680 --> 03:25:13,960
Alright, let's start filling this up and see, kind of get a gauge of what all we need to start collecting.

3335
03:25:14,440 --> 03:25:15,520
Oh, here we go.

3336
03:25:16,240 --> 03:25:17,220
Here we go.

3337
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:22,380
I know where to get another one of these.

3338
03:25:23,380 --> 03:25:24,860
I just have to buy some...

3339
03:25:25,640 --> 03:25:26,760
Oh, I have more cloth.

3340
03:25:27,200 --> 03:25:27,880
Oh, there we go.

3341
03:25:28,260 --> 03:25:29,520
Oh no, I just didn't put it in.

3342
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:37,140
So we need two wood, one scrap, two cloth.

3343
03:25:39,380 --> 03:25:40,600
Oh, it's only two cloth.

3344
03:25:40,640 --> 03:25:41,200
I thought it was three.

3345
03:25:41,360 --> 03:25:42,600
Okay, I thought it was five in total.

3346
03:25:43,540 --> 03:25:45,500
And then I know where to get another refined metal.

3347
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:48,380
We gotta go blow up something.

3348
03:25:50,020 --> 03:25:51,710
So let me buy that.

3349
03:25:55,240 --> 03:25:56,020
Wait.

3350
03:25:58,260 --> 03:26:01,560
Don't you do not sell...

3351
03:26:01,560 --> 03:26:03,020
She doesn't sell explosives?

3352
03:26:03,880 --> 03:26:04,280
Okay.

3353
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:08,120
I don't have any in inventory.

3354
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:09,340
Storage, no.

3355
03:26:11,240 --> 03:26:12,020
Okay.

3356
03:26:12,020 --> 03:26:12,240
Okay.

3357
03:26:14,860 --> 03:26:19,720
Yeah, we gotta go to the merchant, I think.

3358
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:37,180
How do I wanna do this?

3359
03:26:40,840 --> 03:26:44,060
Since we... Okay, let's first get the dredge thing.

3360
03:26:45,920 --> 03:26:48,860
And this guy does... I think this guy sells some too.

3361
03:26:49,520 --> 03:26:51,400
So let's first go get that.

3362
03:26:54,300 --> 03:26:56,540
And... Wow, Detective Shane!

3363
03:26:57,680 --> 03:27:00,420
Welcome to membership, thank you so much.

3364
03:27:00,900 --> 03:27:01,960
We'll go get that.

3365
03:27:02,980 --> 03:27:04,500
We'll put on the dredge.

3366
03:27:08,580 --> 03:27:09,300
Net.

3367
03:27:20,090 --> 03:27:22,070
We'll be good to go.

3368
03:27:22,070 --> 03:27:22,250
Oh.

3369
03:27:27,390 --> 03:27:27,950
Speed.

3370
03:27:29,430 --> 03:27:30,550
More speed.

3371
03:27:31,930 --> 03:27:33,050
More speed.

3372
03:27:35,210 --> 03:27:36,330
Oh, my lights are off.

3373
03:27:36,530 --> 03:27:37,110
Since when?

3374
03:27:38,390 --> 03:27:40,590
I was gonna say, it's kinda hard to see.

3375
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:49,960
What happens if the bar reaches the top?

3376
03:27:50,020 --> 03:27:51,160
You take some damage.

3377
03:28:04,030 --> 03:28:04,630
Cute.

3378
03:28:04,950 --> 03:28:05,990
Thank you very much.

3379
03:28:06,770 --> 03:28:08,090
How much are you selling this for?

3380
03:28:08,630 --> 03:28:09,230
425.

3381
03:28:09,850 --> 03:28:11,150
Okay, okay, okay.

3382
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:18,060
Probably since the gooping season.

3383
03:28:20,460 --> 03:28:21,760
I've been gooping.

3384
03:28:22,160 --> 03:28:23,400
Oh, should we get another engine?

3385
03:28:24,500 --> 03:28:26,180
I just realized I have an extra spot.

3386
03:28:27,800 --> 03:28:29,900
We can go faster.

3387
03:28:29,900 --> 03:28:30,020
Yeah!

3388
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:36,860
Wait, these are all facing... Oh, my God.

3389
03:28:37,300 --> 03:28:38,620
This looks horrible.

3390
03:28:39,460 --> 03:28:41,540
You guys are all facing different directions.

3391
03:28:42,260 --> 03:28:43,480
Oh, this looks like the worst.

3392
03:28:44,640 --> 03:28:46,260
Who installed this?

3393
03:28:49,100 --> 03:28:51,440
Alright, and I think we need... Oh, hold on.

3394
03:28:52,060 --> 03:28:56,340
I think we also need the basic trawl net.

3395
03:28:57,340 --> 03:28:59,500
Let's go to the factory.

3396
03:29:00,100 --> 03:29:02,340
And then...

3397
03:29:03,180 --> 03:29:04,720
Material harvester.

3398
03:29:05,860 --> 03:29:06,680
Storage.

3399
03:29:08,900 --> 03:29:09,340
You.

3400
03:29:11,280 --> 03:29:12,500
And...

3401
03:29:12,500 --> 03:29:13,040
You.

3402
03:29:14,880 --> 03:29:15,860
Thank you.

3403
03:29:17,060 --> 03:29:20,340
And we're gonna have... We're gonna install...

3404
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:23,260
Okay.

3405
03:29:26,340 --> 03:29:28,920
We're gonna be so much faster now.

3406
03:29:29,900 --> 03:29:32,440
We're gonna be crazy fast.

3407
03:29:33,600 --> 03:29:34,980
Crazy speeds.

3408
03:29:35,680 --> 03:29:37,500
Like no one has...

3409
03:29:37,500 --> 03:29:38,960
What the... Oh.

3410
03:29:42,320 --> 03:29:45,480
No one has ever anticipated...

3411
03:29:45,480 --> 03:29:48,420
Someone going at this speed before.

3412
03:29:49,340 --> 03:29:51,360
It's absolute insanity.

3413
03:29:57,590 --> 03:29:58,710
Look at...

3414
03:29:58,710 --> 03:30:00,050
My gosh, it's so clean.

3415
03:30:00,430 --> 03:30:00,990
Thermometer!

3416
03:30:01,570 --> 03:30:02,150
That's so cute.

3417
03:30:02,230 --> 03:30:02,830
I want to squish.

3418
03:30:04,790 --> 03:30:06,290
Don't squish my eye!

3419
03:30:08,650 --> 03:30:09,210
Clean.

3420
03:30:09,910 --> 03:30:11,350
Clean, clean, clean.

3421
03:30:14,780 --> 03:30:16,300
Gathering discarded materials.

3422
03:30:16,420 --> 03:30:19,560
I guess we can get this once we switch back to...

3423
03:30:20,580 --> 03:30:21,680
Our usual.

3424
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:23,400
This big boy.

3425
03:30:23,860 --> 03:30:25,280
Our heavy duty trawl net.

3426
03:30:25,280 --> 03:30:28,480
We can get the flotsam trap and just kind of like...

3427
03:30:28,480 --> 03:30:30,580
Leave it out and collect stuff passively.

3428
03:30:34,440 --> 03:30:34,940
Yeah!

3429
03:30:35,900 --> 03:30:37,160
Still missing that map piece.

3430
03:30:37,240 --> 03:30:37,720
I know!

3431
03:30:38,340 --> 03:30:43,120
Actually, there was a place that I wanted to explore that I know we haven't been to yet.

3432
03:30:43,760 --> 03:30:44,560
Wait a second.

3433
03:30:46,660 --> 03:30:47,160
Boxhole!

3434
03:30:47,160 --> 03:30:47,380
Whoa!

3435
03:30:52,280 --> 03:30:55,420
There we go.

3436
03:30:56,040 --> 03:30:57,240
More box.

3437
03:31:08,400 --> 03:31:09,740
It's been a bit... Hello.

3438
03:31:10,280 --> 03:31:10,740
Hello!

3439
03:31:11,400 --> 03:31:12,220
Welcome back!

3440
03:31:13,220 --> 03:31:13,880
Thank you!

3441
03:31:15,620 --> 03:31:16,380
Alright.

3442
03:31:20,160 --> 03:31:20,760
Oh, there's more.

3443
03:31:21,360 --> 03:31:22,940
OK, we'll drop these off at storage.

3444
03:31:32,030 --> 03:31:33,190
Skate geek.

3445
03:31:37,720 --> 03:31:39,800
That's what the plushie is for.

3446
03:31:40,100 --> 03:31:41,500
To squeeze, to squish.

3447
03:31:42,160 --> 03:31:45,200
For everybody who's gotten the plushie, is her head really dense?

3448
03:31:49,320 --> 03:31:52,300
Is it like super, you know...

3449
03:31:58,480 --> 03:32:00,100
Yes, it's so dense.

3450
03:32:02,880 --> 03:32:03,440
OK.

3451
03:32:04,700 --> 03:32:08,640
I told them to make it less dense, but I guess it never...

3452
03:32:08,640 --> 03:32:10,400
I guess it never happened.

3453
03:32:14,750 --> 03:32:15,570
That's OK.

3454
03:32:16,870 --> 03:32:20,190
I just... The Mito plushie holds lots of secrets.

3455
03:32:20,870 --> 03:32:21,990
Lots of knowledge.

3456
03:32:23,770 --> 03:32:25,630
It's so big and dense, it's perfect.

3457
03:32:27,110 --> 03:32:28,930
Like, you don't need to include the big part.

3458
03:32:29,330 --> 03:32:31,790
Well, it's big because it has lots of knowledge, you know.

3459
03:32:35,470 --> 03:32:36,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3460
03:32:40,950 --> 03:32:41,490
Orcas!

3461
03:32:41,490 --> 03:32:41,850
Orcas.

3462
03:32:43,370 --> 03:32:44,310
Killer whale.

3463
03:32:48,170 --> 03:32:50,010
Will there be a third wave of pre-orders?

3464
03:32:51,850 --> 03:32:52,410
Yes?

3465
03:32:53,490 --> 03:32:55,110
Eventually I would like to.

3466
03:32:57,570 --> 03:33:01,090
I wasn't sure when to do it, because...

3467
03:33:01,090 --> 03:33:04,210
I didn't want like, you know...

3468
03:33:06,970 --> 03:33:08,090
Like a...

3469
03:33:08,090 --> 03:33:09,210
How do I say?

3470
03:33:10,710 --> 03:33:11,150
Well...

3471
03:33:12,230 --> 03:33:15,190
There was a reason and I don't remember what my reasoning was.

3472
03:33:16,190 --> 03:33:17,710
Wait, I don't even remember why.

3473
03:33:18,910 --> 03:33:19,650
I don't remember.

3474
03:33:20,050 --> 03:33:20,730
I had a reason.

3475
03:33:22,530 --> 03:33:23,350
I promise.

3476
03:33:23,910 --> 03:33:25,290
But there should be, eventually.

3477
03:33:28,030 --> 03:33:30,390
Wait, can I blow this one up or do I have to go around?

3478
03:33:31,090 --> 03:33:32,150
OK, I have to go around.

3479
03:33:37,520 --> 03:33:38,300
Right here.

3480
03:33:51,740 --> 03:33:52,260
Hey!

3481
03:33:52,460 --> 03:33:52,820
Whoa!

3482
03:33:54,020 --> 03:33:55,320
This one's intense.

3483
03:33:59,880 --> 03:34:00,400
Nice!

3484
03:34:00,500 --> 03:34:02,100
And that's some refined metal, baby!

3485
03:34:02,680 --> 03:34:04,100
Alright, so now we just need one more.

3486
03:34:07,040 --> 03:34:08,900
We just need one more.

3487
03:34:10,340 --> 03:34:11,040
OK, hold on.

3488
03:34:12,420 --> 03:34:13,820
Let's get our lights back on.

3489
03:34:14,900 --> 03:34:15,900
And... haste.

3490
03:34:16,660 --> 03:34:18,120
We must make haste.

3491
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:18,160
What?

3492
03:34:28,320 --> 03:34:32,160
What if I honk back?

3493
03:34:38,220 --> 03:34:39,800
It lights them up!

3494
03:34:39,840 --> 03:34:40,640
That's so cool!

3495
03:34:42,060 --> 03:34:44,560
It like lights up what areas I can...

3496
03:34:44,560 --> 03:34:45,280
Wow!

3497
03:34:47,280 --> 03:34:48,040
Interesting.

3498
03:35:00,420 --> 03:35:01,560
OK, I'm done.

3499
03:35:04,040 --> 03:35:05,020
Echo location.

3500
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:10,660
What did we get in our thing?

3501
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:11,400
I wonder.

3502
03:35:12,700 --> 03:35:14,800
We got some... a boot?

3503
03:35:16,980 --> 03:35:17,880
What the hell?

3504
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:19,300
Fancy boot!

3505
03:35:19,780 --> 03:35:21,280
Large and sturdy looking boot.

3506
03:35:21,460 --> 03:35:25,140
Waterlogged leather straps are laced through shiny metal clasps.

3507
03:35:30,160 --> 03:35:30,840
OK.

3508
03:35:32,180 --> 03:35:32,760
What?

3509
03:35:36,990 --> 03:35:37,670
What?

3510
03:35:40,130 --> 03:35:41,690
Honk if you love me though!

3511
03:35:41,890 --> 03:35:42,610
Honk honk!

3512
03:35:47,350 --> 03:35:49,190
There's a snake in my boot.

3513
03:35:50,850 --> 03:35:52,470
I guess can I sell this?

3514
03:35:52,730 --> 03:35:54,310
Yeah, it's just a little trinket.

3515
03:35:54,630 --> 03:35:55,250
OK, cool.

3516
03:35:56,310 --> 03:35:57,490
What was I working on?

3517
03:35:57,650 --> 03:35:58,890
Sorry guys, I completely forgot.

3518
03:35:59,090 --> 03:36:00,250
Oh, I wanted to get the...

3519
03:36:00,250 --> 03:36:01,930
Oh my gosh, the upgrade is so expensive.

3520
03:36:02,050 --> 03:36:03,270
It's half our money basically.

3521
03:36:08,070 --> 03:36:11,970
And then from there, we get all the upgrades and we don't even have to get a new hole?

3522
03:36:12,110 --> 03:36:13,010
Like, we're crazy.

3523
03:36:25,150 --> 03:36:26,950
I do know...

3524
03:36:26,950 --> 03:36:27,970
Let's just sleep.

3525
03:36:31,750 --> 03:36:33,110
Honk honk.

3526
03:36:34,070 --> 03:36:37,950
Let's go to sleep and we're gonna go to...

3527
03:36:38,530 --> 03:36:39,590
The oil rig.

3528
03:36:40,450 --> 03:36:42,310
We're completely aban...

3529
03:36:42,310 --> 03:36:45,350
We've completely abandoned the main plot for a bit.

3530
03:36:47,530 --> 03:36:48,410
That's OK.

3531
03:36:48,550 --> 03:36:51,510
I'm gonna gather some supplies right here because I know there are some.

3532
03:36:53,250 --> 03:36:54,290
Right here.

3533
03:36:55,530 --> 03:36:57,130
And I believe that's cloth.

3534
03:36:57,230 --> 03:36:57,750
Nice.

3535
03:36:59,010 --> 03:37:00,950
Oh wait, I don't think I need anymore wood.

3536
03:37:01,970 --> 03:37:03,490
That's alright, I'll still grab some.

3537
03:37:03,750 --> 03:37:04,830
We'll need it in the future.

3538
03:37:06,770 --> 03:37:09,290
Honestly, once I do this upgrade...

3539
03:37:10,010 --> 03:37:11,290
Or once I...

3540
03:37:12,830 --> 03:37:17,290
Once I finish upgrading the ship to the full capacity...

3541
03:37:20,340 --> 03:37:23,460
We don't really need so much supplies anymore, do we?

3542
03:37:26,440 --> 03:37:29,140
I forgot that dredge can also be...

3543
03:37:32,120 --> 03:37:33,620
Like little trinkets.

3544
03:37:44,760 --> 03:37:45,780
That'll scrap.

3545
03:37:46,520 --> 03:37:47,520
We'll do another one.

3546
03:37:47,700 --> 03:37:49,800
I don't remember if it was one or two that we needed more.

3547
03:37:54,260 --> 03:37:56,380
We can do another one.

3548
03:38:04,370 --> 03:38:05,870
I'm dumping out the...

3549
03:38:06,430 --> 03:38:07,370
That's good for now.

3550
03:38:17,790 --> 03:38:18,350
Mmm...

3551
03:38:25,910 --> 03:38:29,550
We... I think we still need one cloth for the upgrade.

3552
03:38:29,950 --> 03:38:30,310
Or two.

3553
03:38:30,530 --> 03:38:30,890
One or two.

3554
03:38:39,810 --> 03:38:41,130
Let's go sell the boot.

3555
03:38:42,010 --> 03:38:42,690
Two cloth.

3556
03:38:44,790 --> 03:38:46,250
Don't need anymore wood.

3557
03:38:53,850 --> 03:38:55,730
Cloth is by the place where you got the refinement.

3558
03:38:55,810 --> 03:38:56,330
There is?

3559
03:38:58,530 --> 03:38:59,350
I will check.

3560
03:38:59,510 --> 03:39:00,010
I will check.

3561
03:39:00,310 --> 03:39:01,790
Oh, I didn't bring the... Oh, I did bring the boot.

3562
03:39:04,770 --> 03:39:05,130
Nice.

3563
03:39:07,010 --> 03:39:08,130
51 dollar boot?

3564
03:39:08,250 --> 03:39:09,610
That's like a pair of boots.

3565
03:39:13,210 --> 03:39:13,850
There is?

3566
03:39:19,170 --> 03:39:19,890
Over here.

3567
03:39:23,820 --> 03:39:25,560
Trust me, I got that right there.

3568
03:39:25,960 --> 03:39:26,540
That cloth.

3569
03:39:27,560 --> 03:39:28,000
Oh, it is.

3570
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:28,400
You're right.

3571
03:39:31,360 --> 03:39:32,600
Thank you very much.

3572
03:39:33,840 --> 03:39:36,740
It looked like scrap to me earlier, which is why I ignored it.

3573
03:39:37,660 --> 03:39:38,840
Good eyes, everybody.

3574
03:39:38,900 --> 03:39:39,700
Good eyes.

3575
03:39:43,260 --> 03:39:44,020
Oh my gosh.

3576
03:39:44,680 --> 03:39:45,540
Are we gonna get the upgrade?

3577
03:39:49,380 --> 03:39:51,260
No, I still need... I could buy it.

3578
03:39:51,320 --> 03:39:52,580
I could buy the refined metal.

3579
03:39:56,080 --> 03:39:57,400
Should I just buy it?

3580
03:39:57,740 --> 03:39:59,020
It's 400 dollars.

3581
03:39:59,560 --> 03:40:02,260
Once we start getting big fish again...

3582
03:40:02,260 --> 03:40:06,120
Right now we haven't made so much money because we haven't been like oceanic fishing.

3583
03:40:09,600 --> 03:40:11,360
I've been doing quests instead.

3584
03:40:12,040 --> 03:40:12,660
Buy it?

3585
03:40:13,140 --> 03:40:13,600
OK!

3586
03:40:14,160 --> 03:40:15,420
Let's buy it!

3587
03:40:16,060 --> 03:40:16,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3588
03:40:17,660 --> 03:40:18,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3589
03:40:20,460 --> 03:40:21,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3590
03:40:26,140 --> 03:40:26,940
Oh my god.

3591
03:40:27,100 --> 03:40:28,220
Oh my god.

3592
03:40:28,440 --> 03:40:30,120
Oh my god, you guys.

3593
03:40:33,100 --> 03:40:34,840
No, but you don't sell it!

3594
03:40:35,080 --> 03:40:36,580
I have to go to a merchant.

3595
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:37,240
Dang it.

3596
03:40:38,420 --> 03:40:39,700
We have to go to the merchant.

3597
03:40:41,100 --> 03:40:41,880
Screw it.

3598
03:40:42,280 --> 03:40:42,960
It's only midnight.

3599
03:40:45,980 --> 03:40:47,080
We are brave.

3600
03:40:48,520 --> 03:40:49,640
We are brave.

3601
03:40:50,140 --> 03:40:51,840
We've been on these oceans before.

3602
03:40:55,200 --> 03:40:57,580
The water is really dark.

3603
03:40:59,500 --> 03:41:01,880
We are... Yeah, we are.

3604
03:41:10,820 --> 03:41:11,980
Leave me alone.

3605
03:41:39,900 --> 03:41:41,260
Thank you.

3606
03:41:41,500 --> 03:41:41,920
I'll be right in.

3607
03:41:41,920 --> 03:41:42,500
Just a second.

3608
03:41:42,620 --> 03:41:43,400
I'm concentrated.

3609
03:41:44,100 --> 03:41:45,260
I'm locked in.

3610
03:41:48,420 --> 03:41:49,140
I'm there.

3611
03:41:58,080 --> 03:41:59,560
I hate that guy!

3612
03:42:00,880 --> 03:42:02,280
Driver says thank you!

3613
03:42:03,060 --> 03:42:06,780
I've been trying to keep a record of where all that dark liquid has been showing up.

3614
03:42:06,860 --> 03:42:09,500
Come see me if you need any points for decontamination.

3615
03:42:09,720 --> 03:42:10,020
OK!

3616
03:42:10,240 --> 03:42:10,780
Thank you!

3617
03:42:14,930 --> 03:42:16,570
I haven't done anything with him yet.

3618
03:42:19,450 --> 03:42:23,110
What sucks is I'm gonna buy this and then we're gonna have to go all the way back again.

3619
03:42:24,090 --> 03:42:25,050
That's okay though.

3620
03:42:26,250 --> 03:42:28,190
Because this place doesn't have a dry dock.

3621
03:42:28,470 --> 03:42:30,430
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay.

3622
03:42:38,150 --> 03:42:40,090
I still need this thing.

3623
03:42:42,250 --> 03:42:44,050
Which we can make actually.

3624
03:42:45,830 --> 03:42:46,310
Yes.

3625
03:42:47,570 --> 03:42:48,670
Coastal and shallow.

3626
03:42:48,850 --> 03:42:50,170
I'm gonna sell this guy.

3627
03:42:51,410 --> 03:42:53,310
I can't sell this guy.

3628
03:42:53,390 --> 03:42:54,390
Why can't I sell you?

3629
03:42:54,490 --> 03:42:55,590
I can only discard it.

3630
03:42:55,630 --> 03:42:56,150
That sucks.

3631
03:42:56,670 --> 03:42:58,110
Maybe because they gave it to me.

3632
03:43:00,030 --> 03:43:01,470
Because we're gonna make this guy.

3633
03:43:06,960 --> 03:43:07,380
No!

3634
03:43:08,100 --> 03:43:09,880
You guys, I took off my old net.

3635
03:43:11,440 --> 03:43:16,740
I took off my old net without getting the goop out first.

3636
03:43:20,920 --> 03:43:22,660
I wish it would...

3637
03:43:25,580 --> 03:43:28,640
I wish it would auto empty.

3638
03:43:29,400 --> 03:43:30,680
That's so frustrating!

3639
03:43:43,200 --> 03:43:45,280
Oh my goop!

3640
03:43:45,620 --> 03:43:50,280
I spent endless nights trying to get the goop.

3641
03:44:02,800 --> 03:44:04,100
What do we wanna do?

3642
03:44:05,600 --> 03:44:07,880
Time for another goop sesh, I guess so.

3643
03:44:09,100 --> 03:44:11,240
I guess so.

3644
03:44:28,680 --> 03:44:30,720
I already uninstalled it.

3645
03:44:32,160 --> 03:44:33,480
But I will...

3646
03:44:33,480 --> 03:44:40,230
Do this guy too.

3647
03:44:41,990 --> 03:44:44,750
I guess it doesn't really matter.

3648
03:44:46,890 --> 03:44:48,230
He's there!

3649
03:44:48,810 --> 03:44:49,930
Oh my gosh!

3650
03:44:52,430 --> 03:44:53,690
Oh my go...

3651
03:44:53,690 --> 03:44:58,170
I took it out for nothing.

3652
03:44:58,630 --> 03:44:59,370
That's okay though.

3653
03:45:00,330 --> 03:45:01,750
Alright, so we have this.

3654
03:45:02,590 --> 03:45:03,850
I'm gonna put that in storage.

3655
03:45:04,350 --> 03:45:05,710
Let's go back, upgrade my ship.

3656
03:45:06,090 --> 03:45:09,950
And then we can also go to the gale area to get these.

3657
03:45:12,030 --> 03:45:14,470
And we can start fishing oceanic fish again.

3658
03:45:14,470 --> 03:45:19,170
Oh, but actually then I guess I don't need the goop trawler.

3659
03:45:19,750 --> 03:45:21,850
So let's uninstall again.

3660
03:45:22,310 --> 03:45:23,750
And throw you in the storage.

3661
03:45:27,250 --> 03:45:27,690
Yeah,

3662
03:45:34,120 --> 03:45:34,880
we'll do this one again.

3663
03:45:37,160 --> 03:45:38,220
We'll do this one again.

3664
03:45:41,100 --> 03:45:43,740
We just took a whole day to do it, but that's okay.

3665
03:45:43,740 --> 03:45:43,860
That's okay.

3666
03:45:47,400 --> 03:45:47,920
Alright.

3667
03:45:52,140 --> 03:45:52,660
Nice.

3668
03:45:55,520 --> 03:45:58,820
You can get a swordfish with the upgraded oceanic rod too.

3669
03:45:59,800 --> 03:46:01,100
Which is what I have now, right?

3670
03:46:02,100 --> 03:46:02,680
This one.

3671
03:46:04,500 --> 03:46:05,020
Yes.

3672
03:46:05,740 --> 03:46:08,380
Yeah, we can go get that guy.

3673
03:46:10,220 --> 03:46:10,780
Alright.

3674
03:46:11,840 --> 03:46:13,560
Okay, that all worked out.

3675
03:46:18,670 --> 03:46:20,490
Was that my first hit?

3676
03:46:22,210 --> 03:46:25,130
Didn't it say that upgraded hull can take a hit?

3677
03:46:32,830 --> 03:46:35,490
What we're gonna do is we're gonna go get some...

3678
03:46:35,490 --> 03:46:37,650
There were some special fishy over here.

3679
03:46:38,170 --> 03:46:39,890
Some special goop fish over here.

3680
03:46:40,030 --> 03:46:41,130
And there's boxes.

3681
03:46:41,130 --> 03:46:44,890
But I wanna have room for the fish.

3682
03:46:45,310 --> 03:46:47,550
So I'm gonna avoid those boxes for a second.

3683
03:46:49,690 --> 03:46:51,090
We're gonna ignore them.

3684
03:46:51,650 --> 03:46:53,370
Oh my gosh, there's another box.

3685
03:46:53,850 --> 03:46:54,970
There's so many boxes.

3686
03:46:55,510 --> 03:46:56,930
Why would you ever make boxes?

3687
03:46:56,990 --> 03:46:59,130
I guess if you're in a hurry and you have a lot of supplies.

3688
03:46:59,490 --> 03:46:59,610
Oh!

3689
03:47:01,230 --> 03:47:01,810
There we go.

3690
03:47:02,270 --> 03:47:02,830
I forgot.

3691
03:47:03,030 --> 03:47:03,330
My bad.

3692
03:47:04,650 --> 03:47:05,930
We're in business now.

3693
03:47:06,390 --> 03:47:07,950
We're in business now.

3694
03:47:09,030 --> 03:47:09,650
Alright, what are you?

3695
03:47:10,390 --> 03:47:10,930
No, no.

3696
03:47:20,360 --> 03:47:23,220
I can get one!

3697
03:47:25,500 --> 03:47:28,600
Oh my gosh, this shape is atrocious.

3698
03:47:29,360 --> 03:47:30,440
Can I get two?

3699
03:47:35,300 --> 03:47:36,720
I can get two!

3700
03:47:38,280 --> 03:47:39,200
Let's go!

3701
03:47:39,480 --> 03:47:40,780
Those are gonna sell for big money.

3702
03:47:49,730 --> 03:47:52,490
We're pointed toward... What is that over there?

3703
03:48:01,610 --> 03:48:03,070
Many dollars.

3704
03:48:05,330 --> 03:48:07,330
Since we're here, let's just go in.

3705
03:48:09,210 --> 03:48:10,250
And sell.

3706
03:48:11,230 --> 03:48:12,270
And make money.

3707
03:48:14,710 --> 03:48:15,710
The boat upgrade.

3708
03:48:17,470 --> 03:48:19,210
What are you?

3709
03:48:19,890 --> 03:48:21,230
Are you a small fish?

3710
03:48:21,230 --> 03:48:22,750
I can catch you.

3711
03:48:28,740 --> 03:48:30,260
You can do one more.

3712
03:48:36,300 --> 03:48:36,940
Nice.

3713
03:48:55,120 --> 03:48:56,820
Don't get lost!

3714
03:49:04,580 --> 03:49:05,700
Hell yeah!

3715
03:49:07,060 --> 03:49:09,020
And we got these crab pods.

3716
03:49:09,120 --> 03:49:10,200
We gotta do something with them.

3717
03:49:11,040 --> 03:49:11,420
Let's go.

3718
03:49:11,480 --> 03:49:12,660
We'll also go sell our stuff.

3719
03:49:13,060 --> 03:49:13,700
Dry dock.

3720
03:49:18,960 --> 03:49:19,860
Here we go!

3721
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:27,360
Is there anything here now that we can upgrade immediately?

3722
03:49:29,780 --> 03:49:33,420
This is... Let's do the extra storage space first, obviously.

3723
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:37,500
Definitely not this, but...

3724
03:49:38,540 --> 03:49:41,940
We're clearing out space in the storage, which is good.

3725
03:49:43,860 --> 03:49:46,660
No way, we have enough cloth before everything else?

3726
03:49:50,640 --> 03:49:52,220
Times have changed.

3727
03:49:54,600 --> 03:49:56,480
What is it looking...

3728
03:49:58,340 --> 03:50:00,560
You got so much space!

3729
03:50:03,100 --> 03:50:04,500
Let's go sell some stuff.

3730
03:50:12,880 --> 03:50:13,920
So roomy.

3731
03:50:20,570 --> 03:50:22,190
Got... Oh, also...

3732
03:50:22,950 --> 03:50:23,990
Deliver flag.

3733
03:50:25,090 --> 03:50:25,850
Do you want to attach it?

3734
03:50:25,890 --> 03:50:27,210
No, I love my pirate flag.

3735
03:50:29,930 --> 03:50:30,870
Paint the boat.

3736
03:50:30,870 --> 03:50:32,170
The roof.

3737
03:50:32,550 --> 03:50:34,870
I can't do sharp mint yet.

3738
03:50:35,110 --> 03:50:35,850
What do you need again?

3739
03:50:36,630 --> 03:50:38,010
A kingler crab.

3740
03:50:38,190 --> 03:50:39,310
Oh, a mutated kingler crab.

3741
03:50:41,010 --> 03:50:42,690
Cerebral crab.

3742
03:50:45,350 --> 03:50:46,190
Kingler.

3743
03:50:51,380 --> 03:50:58,240
And we sell.

3744
03:51:05,190 --> 03:51:06,370
Oh, my bad.

3745
03:51:07,830 --> 03:51:10,110
Sell for 92 bucks.

3746
03:51:11,630 --> 03:51:14,890
Oh, sell a total of 1,500 dollars worth of trinkets.

3747
03:51:15,310 --> 03:51:15,870
Let's go.

3748
03:51:19,310 --> 03:51:21,090
To the gals!

3749
03:51:22,310 --> 03:51:23,910
We're off to the gals.

3750
03:51:24,270 --> 03:51:25,690
Off to the gals.

3751
03:51:26,050 --> 03:51:27,910
Off to the gals, gals, gals, gals.

3752
03:51:28,150 --> 03:51:29,610
Off to the gals.

3753
03:51:29,930 --> 03:51:31,570
Off to the gals.

3754
03:51:33,130 --> 03:51:36,270
Off to the gals, gals, gals, gals, gals.

3755
03:51:43,440 --> 03:51:44,560
What are you?

3756
03:51:44,840 --> 03:51:46,060
Wait, I can't get you, can I?

3757
03:51:57,700 --> 03:51:59,360
Oh, I see now.

3758
03:52:00,840 --> 03:52:04,060
All the stuff that's gross in here.

3759
03:52:04,780 --> 03:52:05,260
Like you.

3760
03:52:13,720 --> 03:52:15,980
We got ourselves a nautilus.

3761
03:52:27,060 --> 03:52:28,700
The music is really spooky.

3762
03:52:29,780 --> 03:52:31,060
The ambiance.

3763
03:52:34,560 --> 03:52:35,500
We got you.

3764
03:52:37,060 --> 03:52:38,140
What about you?

3765
03:52:38,780 --> 03:52:39,280
What are you?

3766
03:52:39,580 --> 03:52:40,740
What the hell was that?

3767
03:52:42,840 --> 03:52:43,880
Lancet fish!

3768
03:52:47,300 --> 03:52:48,180
What's happening?

3769
03:52:48,540 --> 03:52:49,620
Oh, we got splashed upon.

3770
03:52:52,440 --> 03:52:53,960
Stop screaming whatever you want.

3771
03:52:54,000 --> 03:52:55,420
Oh, it's these little creature things.

3772
03:52:55,800 --> 03:52:57,240
Ew, I don't like them.

3773
03:52:58,780 --> 03:52:59,960
Ew, shut up.

3774
03:53:04,620 --> 03:53:06,180
I don't like them, I don't like them.

3775
03:53:06,380 --> 03:53:09,040
Oh, that area over there is where I want to go.

3776
03:53:10,260 --> 03:53:11,500
I want to go there.

3777
03:53:13,960 --> 03:53:15,520
If I honk, will they disappear?

3778
03:53:19,320 --> 03:53:21,860
Oh, we need to deliver this guy, huh?

3779
03:53:27,000 --> 03:53:27,560
Yes.

3780
03:53:39,760 --> 03:53:42,320
Nice, now we just need three pieces of wood and we're good.

3781
03:53:43,780 --> 03:53:44,120
Honk?

3782
03:53:49,360 --> 03:53:51,160
Let's see what happens if I honk.

3783
03:53:53,980 --> 03:53:55,220
They're gone anyway.

3784
03:53:56,420 --> 03:53:58,240
Yeah, you stinking creatures.

3785
03:53:59,720 --> 03:54:01,800
This area we haven't been to, you guys.

3786
03:54:01,880 --> 03:54:03,160
Look, it's all covered in goop.

3787
03:54:05,320 --> 03:54:08,980
I never got to... I don't think I got to explore it before it got gooped up.

3788
03:54:10,300 --> 03:54:11,100
So sad.

3789
03:54:16,740 --> 03:54:19,180
We never got to check it out before it got all gooped.

3790
03:54:21,440 --> 03:54:22,240
Abyssal thing.

3791
03:54:24,720 --> 03:54:26,420
We shall have to return.

3792
03:54:28,080 --> 03:54:28,780
What's in here?

3793
03:54:28,900 --> 03:54:32,260
A rotting chest peeks out from the skeleton of a wrecked ship.

3794
03:54:34,180 --> 03:54:35,920
Some wood, I'll take it.

3795
03:54:43,060 --> 03:54:44,260
Ok, I'm off to bed.

3796
03:54:44,340 --> 03:54:44,800
So long, Minto.

3797
03:54:44,920 --> 03:54:45,520
Thanks for all the fish.

3798
03:54:45,900 --> 03:54:46,640
Thank you.

3799
03:54:48,100 --> 03:54:48,940
Thank you, JJ.

3800
03:54:49,620 --> 03:54:50,480
Good night.

3801
03:54:55,800 --> 03:54:59,640
It wasn't even sparkling, you son of a gun.

3802
03:55:01,680 --> 03:55:04,440
I wonder, are these things like...

3803
03:55:05,380 --> 03:55:09,080
Are these things ships that I just didn't get to quick enough?

3804
03:55:09,880 --> 03:55:17,740
And they got inhabited when I was playing the game?

3805
03:55:20,880 --> 03:55:22,520
I got crabbed.

3806
03:55:22,760 --> 03:55:24,520
I got crabbed real good.

3807
03:55:34,410 --> 03:55:36,990
This is just a tiny island with nothing on it.

3808
03:55:41,470 --> 03:55:43,830
If I go back to it, will it be upset again?

3809
03:55:45,190 --> 03:55:46,070
Excuse me.

3810
03:55:52,950 --> 03:55:54,130
See you later.

3811
03:56:02,220 --> 03:56:03,460
What are you?

3812
03:56:08,700 --> 03:56:10,100
I'll hold off for now.

3813
03:56:17,900 --> 03:56:21,540
I don't think the scientist cares, but I don't want them to rot until they are gone.

3814
03:56:21,600 --> 03:56:22,100
You know what I mean?

3815
03:56:22,960 --> 03:56:24,840
He's just an angry little guy.

3816
03:56:25,180 --> 03:56:26,440
He's just an angry guy.

3817
03:56:27,220 --> 03:56:28,680
I think... I see it now.

3818
03:56:29,700 --> 03:56:35,400
I think I was gonna say... I think the oil rig is all the way behind that mountain.

3819
03:56:36,840 --> 03:56:37,320
Oh!

3820
03:56:37,980 --> 03:56:39,320
Yeah, my net is deployed.

3821
03:56:39,600 --> 03:56:40,840
Yes, my net is deployed.

3822
03:56:41,000 --> 03:56:42,220
No worries, no worries.

3823
03:56:48,360 --> 03:56:49,320
Where am I?

3824
03:56:52,880 --> 03:56:53,360
Oh.

3825
03:56:54,140 --> 03:56:54,620
Ok.

3826
03:57:05,200 --> 03:57:07,660
There's a lot of goop to scoop up, you guys.

3827
03:57:08,780 --> 03:57:10,300
There's a lot of goop to scoop.

3828
03:57:13,760 --> 03:57:15,980
It's like in a crazy amount.

3829
03:57:17,220 --> 03:57:17,780
Oh, dang it.

3830
03:57:17,880 --> 03:57:18,880
I was trying to avoid it.

3831
03:57:30,060 --> 03:57:34,660
I like how the music is kind of like Minecraft, where it's just a little random.

3832
03:57:45,350 --> 03:57:47,270
It's been four hours already?

3833
03:57:47,410 --> 03:57:48,110
No way.

3834
03:57:51,170 --> 03:57:53,830
I actually am starting to get a bit sleepy.

3835
03:57:59,390 --> 03:58:01,930
I'm enjoying the DLC stuff, though.

3836
03:58:02,210 --> 03:58:07,090
The collecting of the different kinds of stuff is really fun.

3837
03:58:08,330 --> 03:58:09,350
I like it.

3838
03:58:11,410 --> 03:58:12,830
I like this game.

3839
03:58:15,250 --> 03:58:18,390
It is very easy to get lost in the sauce, isn't it?

3840
03:58:19,310 --> 03:58:20,850
Here's my samples.

3841
03:58:22,270 --> 03:58:24,070
This one is a special guy.

3842
03:58:24,210 --> 03:58:25,990
Ok, you better take care of this lancet fish.

3843
03:58:29,410 --> 03:58:30,830
He's a special one.

3844
03:58:40,940 --> 03:58:41,640
Wait a second.

3845
03:58:41,900 --> 03:58:43,380
Yeah, they are...

3846
03:58:44,040 --> 03:58:46,400
Oh, he's the crab type and he's the shallow type.

3847
03:58:46,460 --> 03:58:46,600
Ok.

3848
03:58:48,540 --> 03:58:49,620
Look at him.

3849
03:58:50,900 --> 03:58:52,740
He's our special little guy.

3850
03:58:53,560 --> 03:58:55,220
He looks mutated, doesn't he?

3851
03:58:56,040 --> 03:58:57,160
He looks gross.

3852
03:58:58,260 --> 03:59:01,640
That should be...

3853
03:59:01,640 --> 03:59:03,080
enough wood, I think.

3854
03:59:04,660 --> 03:59:05,700
Let's go to sleep.

3855
03:59:06,260 --> 03:59:07,380
I'm almost going to call it.

3856
03:59:07,600 --> 03:59:07,860
Almost.

3857
03:59:08,260 --> 03:59:08,860
We're going to sleep.

3858
03:59:08,980 --> 03:59:10,440
We're going to go get our upgrade.

3859
03:59:11,480 --> 03:59:12,880
And then I think I'll call it.

3860
03:59:16,870 --> 03:59:18,310
Because we're really close.

3861
03:59:18,970 --> 03:59:20,090
I think you needed three.

3862
03:59:20,190 --> 03:59:21,170
Yeah, I have one here.

3863
03:59:21,950 --> 03:59:23,090
And I'm going to pick up two more.

3864
03:59:26,290 --> 03:59:28,250
Are you saying you've been duped by the goop?

3865
03:59:31,350 --> 03:59:32,530
Duped by the goop.

3866
03:59:37,230 --> 03:59:40,070
I never thought...

3867
03:59:40,070 --> 03:59:43,630
any goop would...

3868
03:59:48,110 --> 03:59:50,950
I can't...I just...

3869
03:59:50,950 --> 03:59:53,810
It's just...unfathomable.

3870
03:59:54,610 --> 03:59:54,890
No?

3871
03:59:59,410 --> 04:00:02,210
I just...

3872
04:00:08,300 --> 04:00:09,700
Ok,

3873
04:00:12,800 --> 04:00:13,340
I'm done crying.

3874
04:00:14,200 --> 04:00:14,920
Let's fish a little.

3875
04:00:17,360 --> 04:00:19,280
We can sell these fellows.

3876
04:00:24,000 --> 04:00:27,160
I should also deploy my crab pots.

3877
04:00:27,760 --> 04:00:32,740
But I believe I probably have to deploy it around...

3878
04:00:32,740 --> 04:00:35,020
Around the gale place.

3879
04:00:35,300 --> 04:00:38,280
Mother Basin Antarctica, they made these DLCs just for you.

3880
04:00:38,400 --> 04:00:38,620
Right!

3881
04:00:39,280 --> 04:00:40,620
Thanks for the comfy fishing tonight.

3882
04:00:40,780 --> 04:00:41,760
Thank you!

3883
04:00:43,640 --> 04:00:44,580
I know, right?

3884
04:00:44,640 --> 04:00:46,580
It feels like this game was kind of made for me.

3885
04:00:47,620 --> 04:00:48,600
I'm not going to lie.

3886
04:00:50,280 --> 04:00:51,700
I'm not going to lie.

3887
04:00:53,040 --> 04:00:54,060
I'm a big fan.

3888
04:01:01,590 --> 04:01:01,970
Hey!

3889
04:01:04,790 --> 04:01:06,510
We need to sell things.

3890
04:01:07,470 --> 04:01:08,650
We need to make money.

3891
04:01:11,090 --> 04:01:12,650
We need to make money pronto.

3892
04:01:13,790 --> 04:01:14,870
Let's put that in here.

3893
04:01:15,370 --> 04:01:17,070
Oh, there's the compute.

3894
04:01:17,070 --> 04:01:17,870
I was looking for you.

3895
04:01:28,020 --> 04:01:31,280
My organization is not nearly as clean as before, but...

3896
04:01:31,900 --> 04:01:32,620
It could be worse.

3897
04:01:37,170 --> 04:01:37,550
Whatever.

3898
04:01:39,130 --> 04:01:40,210
Ito, I love you so much.

3899
04:01:40,290 --> 04:01:42,270
Thanks for being the best ghost mid.

3900
04:01:42,610 --> 04:01:44,090
It was my birthday yesterday and I have a song.

3901
04:01:44,170 --> 04:01:46,130
Of course, Kurokami-sensei!

3902
04:01:47,060 --> 04:01:50,410
Happy birthday to you!

3903
04:01:51,130 --> 04:01:53,690
Happy birthday to you!

3904
04:01:54,170 --> 04:01:58,230
Happy birthday, Kurokami-sensei!

3905
04:01:59,010 --> 04:02:02,170
Happy birthday to you!

3906
04:02:03,450 --> 04:02:04,230
Happy birthday!

3907
04:02:04,810 --> 04:02:06,150
Thank you for the super chat!

3908
04:02:07,010 --> 04:02:08,110
Sorry I'm a bit late.

3909
04:02:09,850 --> 04:02:13,990
Always a treat to watch you enjoy slash get addicted to a new game, Minky.

3910
04:02:13,990 --> 04:02:19,010
Like I said, I think it's just really nice for me to have a game that I feel...

3911
04:02:19,610 --> 04:02:22,290
I can really just kind of brain off.

3912
04:02:22,450 --> 04:02:25,210
Even though I'm brain off, but there's also...

3913
04:02:25,210 --> 04:02:27,270
There is a good amount of thinking in this game.

3914
04:02:28,570 --> 04:02:30,990
Don't get me wrong, I am having to be like...

3915
04:02:32,410 --> 04:02:33,310
Where should we go?

3916
04:02:33,650 --> 04:02:34,350
What should we do?

3917
04:02:34,650 --> 04:02:35,530
How should we do it?

3918
04:02:35,530 --> 04:02:39,750
But yeah...

3919
04:02:41,410 --> 04:02:42,910
Brain off for sure.

3920
04:02:43,870 --> 04:02:45,830
More management in minigames.

3921
04:02:45,910 --> 04:02:47,050
I really like that.

3922
04:02:48,410 --> 04:02:50,430
Yeah, I like it a lot.

3923
04:02:51,990 --> 04:02:54,110
Let's go put some crab bait.

3924
04:02:59,950 --> 04:03:01,570
The goopy gooper goop song.

3925
04:03:01,950 --> 04:03:04,010
I'm a goopy gooper, yeah.

3926
04:03:04,490 --> 04:03:05,670
You're a goopy!

3927
04:03:05,910 --> 04:03:06,990
Oh, I think my...

3928
04:03:10,390 --> 04:03:12,230
Yeah, our trawl net is broke.

3929
04:03:13,010 --> 04:03:13,570
That's okay though.

3930
04:03:13,650 --> 04:03:16,290
Actually, I really don't feel like we need it so much anymore.

3931
04:03:17,650 --> 04:03:18,130
No!

3932
04:03:19,410 --> 04:03:19,850
Come back!

3933
04:03:29,270 --> 04:03:29,950
This way.

3934
04:03:33,970 --> 04:03:34,850
Smash boom!

3935
04:03:35,930 --> 04:03:37,210
Thank you for the five gifted!

3936
04:03:37,970 --> 04:03:39,310
I like your profile picture.

3937
04:03:45,130 --> 04:03:47,810
Crab pot at the cliffs for the paint.

3938
04:03:47,950 --> 04:03:48,590
Oh yeah!

3939
04:03:49,450 --> 04:03:52,370
Your streams are always something I love to model and draw to while watching.

3940
04:03:52,670 --> 04:03:53,130
Thank you, Minto.

3941
04:03:53,590 --> 04:03:54,630
Thank you!

3942
04:03:54,890 --> 04:03:55,990
Am I your muse?

3943
04:03:58,810 --> 04:04:01,350
Thinking about Minto while you're drawing?

3944
04:04:05,270 --> 04:04:05,790
Alright.

3945
04:04:09,900 --> 04:04:13,040
If any little creepy crawlies come out, I'm gonna zap them.

3946
04:04:13,060 --> 04:04:13,660
Watch this.

3947
04:04:14,160 --> 04:04:15,880
Where are you, creepy crawlies?

3948
04:04:16,080 --> 04:04:17,460
Oh, I hear one.

3949
04:04:18,120 --> 04:04:19,040
Sorry.

3950
04:04:22,780 --> 04:04:27,380
I think I need to move.

3951
04:04:32,920 --> 04:04:34,580
It's like...

3952
04:04:35,160 --> 04:04:36,680
It's like...

3953
04:04:40,920 --> 04:04:43,140
It's like a scared tooth.

3954
04:04:58,890 --> 04:05:00,590
Let's uninstall you.

3955
04:05:01,250 --> 04:05:02,770
Reinstall you here.

3956
04:05:03,490 --> 04:05:04,910
How did you get over there anyway?

3957
04:05:05,950 --> 04:05:06,870
Uninstall you.

3958
04:05:07,310 --> 04:05:08,350
Put you in the storage.

3959
04:05:08,850 --> 04:05:10,070
Grab the storage.

3960
04:05:10,370 --> 04:05:11,890
Pick you up out of storage.

3961
04:05:12,450 --> 04:05:13,690
Put you in here.

3962
04:05:15,090 --> 04:05:16,070
Big Minto love.

3963
04:05:16,190 --> 04:05:16,970
Thank you!

3964
04:05:16,970 --> 04:05:17,050
Thank you!

3965
04:05:23,410 --> 04:05:26,590
I'm gonna save on money a little bit right now.

3966
04:05:30,130 --> 04:05:34,430
But we're gonna start getting some big fish again so that I can, you know...

3967
04:05:36,490 --> 04:05:36,930
Yeah.

3968
04:05:37,650 --> 04:05:40,270
So that we can make some more money back.

3969
04:05:41,130 --> 04:05:42,290
We're gonna repair.

3970
04:05:44,790 --> 04:05:47,150
We gotta start making some money again, guys.

3971
04:05:47,150 --> 04:05:48,250
We're gonna sleep.

3972
04:05:49,950 --> 04:05:51,230
We're gonna undock.

3973
04:05:52,490 --> 04:05:53,850
We're gonna go around.

3974
04:05:58,220 --> 04:05:59,020
Can I get you?

3975
04:05:59,500 --> 04:05:59,900
Yeah.

3976
04:06:00,980 --> 04:06:02,940
Let's go to the shallow water.

3977
04:06:03,140 --> 04:06:04,000
I know there was some over here.

3978
04:06:08,880 --> 04:06:10,240
We dropped below 2000.

3979
04:06:10,440 --> 04:06:11,220
It's Minto over.

3980
04:06:11,580 --> 04:06:12,580
We'll make it back!

3981
04:06:12,780 --> 04:06:14,920
We'll make back the money tenfold.

3982
04:06:15,220 --> 04:06:17,900
Oh, we will once I drop the net.

3983
04:06:18,820 --> 04:06:21,360
We'll make it back 500 fold.

3984
04:06:22,500 --> 04:06:23,820
A bajillion fold.

3985
04:06:25,100 --> 04:06:27,600
700 million fold.

3986
04:06:29,580 --> 04:06:30,340
This is it!

3987
04:06:31,000 --> 04:06:32,980
This is the other creepy crawly we need.

3988
04:06:35,460 --> 04:06:38,580
That thing is sick.

3989
04:06:40,580 --> 04:06:41,700
Sickening.

3990
04:06:44,700 --> 04:06:45,300
Abyssal.

3991
04:06:47,080 --> 04:06:48,520
Too bad it's abyssal.

3992
04:06:49,080 --> 04:06:49,980
Are you abyssal?

3993
04:06:52,320 --> 04:06:53,100
Oh, no.

3994
04:06:53,200 --> 04:06:54,180
We can take another one though.

3995
04:06:59,500 --> 04:07:01,380
One billion dollars.

3996
04:07:02,680 --> 04:07:03,280
Exactly.

3997
04:07:10,980 --> 04:07:12,000
What are you?

3998
04:07:13,120 --> 04:07:13,600
A wreck?

3999
04:07:13,680 --> 04:07:14,780
Oh, this is the wreck fish.

4000
04:07:15,640 --> 04:07:16,600
I'll take you.

4001
04:07:17,390 --> 04:07:17,800
No!

4002
04:07:18,280 --> 04:07:22,720
Why do I get punished?

4003
04:07:25,160 --> 04:07:26,800
Shattered wreck fish.

4004
04:07:27,580 --> 04:07:28,100
That's cool.

4005
04:07:28,240 --> 04:07:28,600
I like that.

4006
04:07:32,020 --> 04:07:33,720
Do these make a lot of money?

4007
04:07:36,340 --> 04:07:37,580
We got two!

4008
04:07:38,180 --> 04:07:38,940
Let's go.

4009
04:07:39,220 --> 04:07:40,460
Bony wreck fish.

4010
04:07:41,020 --> 04:07:41,600
Nice!

4011
04:07:48,620 --> 04:07:50,240
We got two mutants.

4012
04:07:52,980 --> 04:07:54,060
Call me...

4013
04:07:54,820 --> 04:07:56,120
Dr. Xavier.

4014
04:07:57,080 --> 04:07:58,680
I'm collecting mutants.

4015
04:08:03,520 --> 04:08:05,040
I'm gonna wreck fish.

4016
04:08:15,970 --> 04:08:18,350
And our crab things.

4017
04:08:18,590 --> 04:08:19,250
Might be full.

4018
04:08:19,350 --> 04:08:20,630
Sorry, I know I said I was going to stop.

4019
04:08:20,750 --> 04:08:21,870
I will, in a minute.

4020
04:08:24,150 --> 04:08:26,090
I will... Holy moly!

4021
04:08:28,190 --> 04:08:29,390
Holy moly!

4022
04:08:31,110 --> 04:08:34,690
Oh, tiny little anchovies worth nothing pennies.

4023
04:08:35,810 --> 04:08:36,550
Undock.

4024
04:08:38,230 --> 04:08:41,130
Check our crab net.

4025
04:08:46,410 --> 04:08:48,230
He's so cool!

4026
04:08:49,330 --> 04:08:50,350
I like that guy.

4027
04:08:51,110 --> 04:08:51,790
That was worth.

4028
04:08:55,110 --> 04:08:57,670
What is the last thing that he wanted?

4029
04:08:57,770 --> 04:08:58,390
I don't remember.

4030
04:09:04,480 --> 04:09:05,360
It was...

4031
04:09:10,140 --> 04:09:11,020
It was...

4032
04:09:11,020 --> 04:09:12,800
Was it the Trilobite?

4033
04:09:18,250 --> 04:09:20,590
I think if I sleep, my fish will go stale.

4034
04:09:20,810 --> 04:09:23,290
As long as they're not rotten though, I feel like I can give it to him.

4035
04:09:25,530 --> 04:09:25,970
Probably.

4036
04:09:26,590 --> 04:09:26,930
Maybe.

4037
04:09:28,130 --> 04:09:28,370
Ouch.

4038
04:09:30,330 --> 04:09:30,770
Yes.

4039
04:09:44,000 --> 04:09:45,300
He's still fresh.

4040
04:09:50,460 --> 04:09:52,440
Stale is a pass, but rotten isn't.

4041
04:09:52,520 --> 04:09:53,320
Right, right.

4042
04:09:54,900 --> 04:09:56,200
Because I want to sleep.

4043
04:10:00,800 --> 04:10:02,240
Nah, we'll just go back.

4044
04:10:05,480 --> 04:10:07,080
We'll let a couple days pass.

4045
04:10:13,380 --> 04:10:15,100
We'll let a couple days pass.

4046
04:10:16,440 --> 04:10:18,360
And also collect some fish.

4047
04:10:23,960 --> 04:10:25,100
We have a method.

4048
04:10:27,960 --> 04:10:29,660
There is a method to my madness.

4049
04:10:34,580 --> 04:10:35,660
There is a method.

4050
04:10:36,580 --> 04:10:37,260
Where am I?

4051
04:10:39,280 --> 04:10:40,880
I guess I'm going the long way.

4052
04:10:47,000 --> 04:10:48,620
Let's go through a little morrow.

4053
04:10:53,080 --> 04:10:54,200
Or...yeah, yeah, yeah.

4054
04:10:54,480 --> 04:10:55,700
Let's go around this island.

4055
04:10:56,420 --> 04:10:57,240
That's what I'm trying to say.

4056
04:11:01,020 --> 04:11:02,140
Yeah, yeah.

4057
04:11:02,400 --> 04:11:02,780
Here.

4058
04:11:04,220 --> 04:11:04,560
Through.

4059
04:11:07,080 --> 04:11:09,800
There is a method to my madness.

4060
04:11:45,440 --> 04:11:46,520
I can't.

4061
04:11:56,000 --> 04:11:56,880
We're zooming.

4062
04:11:57,020 --> 04:11:57,780
We're zipping by.

4063
04:11:59,020 --> 04:12:00,080
Stealth Gamer.

4064
04:12:00,440 --> 04:12:02,020
Oh my god, you guys.

4065
04:12:03,780 --> 04:12:05,420
Okay, this might sound crazy.

4066
04:12:07,180 --> 04:12:10,160
Have you guys seen the Totally Spies game?

4067
04:12:10,240 --> 04:12:11,100
The newest one.

4068
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:13,660
Came out like last year, I think.

4069
04:12:18,060 --> 04:12:19,880
I kind of want to play it.

4070
04:12:20,540 --> 04:12:20,920
No.

4071
04:12:28,520 --> 04:12:29,840
Can I show you?

4072
04:12:31,620 --> 04:12:33,260
The Totally Spies game.

4073
04:12:38,820 --> 04:12:40,060
I've been trying to keep up.

4074
04:12:40,140 --> 04:12:40,980
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

4075
04:12:41,060 --> 04:12:41,600
I know, I know.

4076
04:12:41,720 --> 04:12:42,200
Leave me alone.

4077
04:12:46,420 --> 04:12:47,060
Okay, hold on.

4078
04:12:47,520 --> 04:12:49,100
I'm going to show you a screenshot, you guys.

4079
04:12:49,200 --> 04:12:50,500
I'm going to Steam.

4080
04:12:50,620 --> 04:12:51,260
It's on Steam.

4081
04:12:51,960 --> 04:12:52,360
Oh, sorry.

4082
04:12:52,460 --> 04:12:53,060
That's Enzoid.

4083
04:12:54,860 --> 04:12:55,260
Uh...

4084
04:12:56,080 --> 04:12:58,320
I was looking it up earlier because I was curious.

4085
04:13:02,500 --> 04:13:04,880
Totally Spies Cyber Mission.

4086
04:13:07,440 --> 04:13:08,000
Hold on.

4087
04:13:09,220 --> 04:13:10,580
Okay, I'm going to show you guys.

4088
04:13:10,660 --> 04:13:12,060
We're going to watch the trailer, alright?

4089
04:13:12,140 --> 04:13:12,520
Real quick.

4090
04:13:15,810 --> 04:13:16,970
Oh, you can still hear the game.

4091
04:13:18,130 --> 04:13:18,870
Shut up, game.

4092
04:13:20,490 --> 04:13:21,610
Game, be quiet.

4093
04:13:22,550 --> 04:13:23,590
Be quiet, game.

4094
04:13:28,550 --> 04:13:29,070
Okay.

4095
04:13:29,650 --> 04:13:30,730
One moment, please.

4096
04:13:31,270 --> 04:13:32,810
This is just a brief intermission.

4097
04:13:34,850 --> 04:13:36,790
This is a brief intermission, okay?

4098
04:13:42,700 --> 04:13:45,100
I need you guys to watch this trailer with me.

4099
04:13:47,320 --> 04:13:49,040
Of the Totally Spies game.

4100
04:13:50,780 --> 04:13:54,400
And tell me you see what I see.

4101
04:13:57,240 --> 04:13:58,080
Ad break.

4102
04:13:58,280 --> 04:13:59,440
This is not an ad.

4103
04:14:00,940 --> 04:14:02,380
Okay, here we go.

4104
04:14:06,020 --> 04:14:07,060
Why are they whistling?

4105
04:14:07,180 --> 04:14:07,680
I hate that.

4106
04:14:12,820 --> 04:14:14,180
Look how cute they are.

4107
04:14:14,180 --> 04:14:17,180
Wait, is this the...

4108
04:14:23,120 --> 04:14:27,040
I hope Clover is fetishized in the game.

4109
04:14:28,580 --> 04:14:29,140
Okay...

4110
04:14:44,440 --> 04:14:48,120
I feel like I need to play this game.

4111
04:14:48,120 --> 04:14:48,840
We'll make it out.

4112
04:14:52,700 --> 04:14:53,640
Oh my gosh.

4113
04:14:53,840 --> 04:14:56,940
I actually didn't watch this with audio earlier.

4114
04:14:58,060 --> 04:14:59,120
Oh my gosh.

4115
04:15:03,020 --> 04:15:03,580
Also...

4116
04:15:03,580 --> 04:15:04,920
The reviews are mixed.

4117
04:15:06,900 --> 04:15:07,860
There's Jerry.

4118
04:15:08,000 --> 04:15:09,520
Everybody wondering where Jerry is.

4119
04:15:09,580 --> 04:15:10,280
There's Jerry.

4120
04:15:14,920 --> 04:15:18,100
The reviews are mixed, but I feel like...

4121
04:15:20,340 --> 04:15:22,740
I feel like I have to play this game.

4122
04:15:25,740 --> 04:15:26,780
I feel...

4123
04:15:31,940 --> 04:15:32,980
You guys...

4124
04:15:32,980 --> 04:15:34,120
You guys!

4125
04:15:41,360 --> 04:15:42,320
Look at this.

4126
04:15:42,940 --> 04:15:44,340
You get to use gadgets.

4127
04:15:45,220 --> 04:15:47,320
And you get to...

4128
04:15:47,320 --> 04:15:48,400
Wait, where did it go?

4129
04:15:48,480 --> 04:15:48,940
Here we go.

4130
04:15:51,820 --> 04:15:52,860
Go undercover.

4131
04:15:54,540 --> 04:15:55,340
Look at this.

4132
04:15:55,360 --> 04:15:58,100
You hide in the locker, which is nothing special obviously.

4133
04:16:06,230 --> 04:16:09,810
And also, I don't know if you guys know this, but...

4134
04:16:10,690 --> 04:16:15,110
Original, I don't know if it's in the new Totally Spies if the new voices are this.

4135
04:16:15,670 --> 04:16:20,630
But Sam in Original Totally Spies is Jennifer Hale.

4136
04:16:31,810 --> 04:16:33,110
Whoa, really?

4137
04:16:33,790 --> 04:16:34,350
Yeah.

4138
04:16:36,910 --> 04:16:37,830
Yeah.

4139
04:16:39,310 --> 04:16:41,530
It all comes back to MGS.

4140
04:16:42,310 --> 04:16:43,370
It does.

4141
04:16:47,960 --> 04:16:49,400
It does.

4142
04:16:49,780 --> 04:16:53,120
It all comes back to Metal Gear Solid.

4143
04:16:56,280 --> 04:17:00,300
It all comes back to Metal Gear Solid.

4144
04:17:00,300 --> 04:17:02,640
Also, this game was released...

4145
04:17:02,640 --> 04:17:04,300
This game was released...

4146
04:17:04,940 --> 04:17:07,880
On Halloween of last year.

4147
04:17:09,540 --> 04:17:12,760
Why did they release the Totally Spies game on Halloween?

4148
04:17:19,260 --> 04:17:19,960
Anyway...

4149
04:17:19,960 --> 04:17:21,900
I'm glad that we can have that little break.

4150
04:17:28,720 --> 04:17:29,740
Fetish gear.

4151
04:17:30,020 --> 04:17:31,020
Wait, what do you mean?

4152
04:17:31,960 --> 04:17:32,440
No!

4153
04:17:37,600 --> 04:17:38,780
What were we doing?

4154
04:17:39,640 --> 04:17:40,980
Oh, I dropped off the specimen.

4155
04:17:42,400 --> 04:17:44,100
And we're waiting to get to that.

4156
04:17:45,040 --> 04:17:46,900
And I'm going to...

4157
04:17:47,900 --> 04:17:48,460
Sleep.

4158
04:17:50,100 --> 04:17:51,080
We're going to undock.

4159
04:17:53,320 --> 04:17:56,140
Now, I'm just a little crazy, but not as crazy.

4160
04:17:59,100 --> 04:18:00,040
Rice Knot, what did you say?

4161
04:18:02,000 --> 04:18:02,840
What did you say?

4162
04:18:03,600 --> 04:18:04,260
What did you say?

4163
04:18:04,500 --> 04:18:05,040
What did you say?

4164
04:18:05,760 --> 04:18:13,620
No joke, a Walmart employee just walked up to me and cold opened with, So, when do you think they're making a Metal Gear movie with Keanu Reeves as Snake?

4165
04:18:14,920 --> 04:18:17,800
Why did somebody come up to you and say that?

4166
04:18:19,160 --> 04:18:20,620
Why did they say that to you?

4167
04:18:20,960 --> 04:18:22,140
Look, they are sneaking in a box.

4168
04:18:22,200 --> 04:18:23,240
I need to play this.

4169
04:18:24,920 --> 04:18:26,260
You don't understand!

4170
04:18:28,320 --> 04:18:34,780
How many games do you get to play as walking in boxes and it not be Metal Gear related?

4171
04:18:45,050 --> 04:18:46,250
It's all Metal Gear!

4172
04:18:48,110 --> 04:18:49,070
Literally hundreds.

4173
04:18:49,250 --> 04:18:49,910
No, shut up!

4174
04:18:51,730 --> 04:18:52,310
No!

4175
04:18:52,890 --> 04:18:53,310
No!

4176
04:18:54,950 --> 04:18:56,170
Zelda Wind Waker.

4177
04:18:56,410 --> 04:18:57,930
Yeah, it all leads back to Metal Gear.

4178
04:18:58,570 --> 04:18:59,590
They did it first.

4179
04:19:02,150 --> 04:19:03,730
They did it first.

4180
04:19:09,090 --> 04:19:11,210
Let me play Totally Spies.

4181
04:19:12,870 --> 04:19:14,890
Let me play Totally Spies.

4182
04:19:16,590 --> 04:19:20,330
It's like all I watched when I was sick in Japan in January.

4183
04:19:22,230 --> 04:19:24,670
I just had Totally Spies on, okay?

4184
04:19:26,410 --> 04:19:29,030
I was like, gosh, this show really was freaky.

4185
04:19:29,750 --> 04:19:33,910
Raise your hand if you discovered you had a fetish from Totally Spies.

4186
04:19:38,380 --> 04:19:39,300
Oh, no.

4187
04:19:40,020 --> 04:19:41,900
I thought you were the...

4188
04:19:47,130 --> 04:19:48,450
Never watched it?

4189
04:19:48,570 --> 04:19:49,290
Oh my gosh.

4190
04:19:49,370 --> 04:19:49,840
It's like...

4191
04:19:56,940 --> 04:19:58,020
It's the...

4192
04:19:58,020 --> 04:19:59,060
Fetish show.

4193
04:20:00,660 --> 04:20:02,480
It really is.

4194
04:20:04,180 --> 04:20:06,020
Never seen it.

4195
04:20:23,160 --> 04:20:26,450
I like him.

4196
04:20:27,970 --> 04:20:28,850
I'm a fan.

4197
04:20:30,550 --> 04:20:32,030
Oh, it's depleted.

4198
04:20:32,290 --> 04:20:32,830
Dang it.

4199
04:20:35,210 --> 04:20:36,790
Let's go sell him off, baby.

4200
04:20:37,350 --> 04:20:38,510
Can I use this thing again?

4201
04:20:39,210 --> 04:20:39,930
Are you still hungry?

4202
04:20:42,210 --> 04:20:42,730
Nope.

4203
04:20:43,750 --> 04:20:44,290
All done.

4204
04:20:48,530 --> 04:20:49,830
That's a cool ass fish.

4205
04:20:49,970 --> 04:20:51,510
That's a cool ass fish.

4206
04:20:53,050 --> 04:20:56,870
I love... Isn't it great how emphasis can change a whole sentence?

4207
04:20:59,410 --> 04:21:00,610
English is so funny.

4208
04:21:01,030 --> 04:21:02,090
Here's your gear, girls.

4209
04:21:02,370 --> 04:21:03,110
What's this, Jerry?

4210
04:21:03,110 --> 04:21:05,130
Alex, that's just a cardboard box.

4211
04:21:05,190 --> 04:21:06,650
Perfect, I'll take this one.

4212
04:21:12,010 --> 04:21:13,390
Are you winning, Minto?

4213
04:21:13,590 --> 04:21:14,850
I think so, actually.

4214
04:21:15,490 --> 04:21:17,990
I think we're doing a pretty darn good job.

4215
04:21:24,450 --> 04:21:27,870
I didn't develop a fetish from the show, but I had a massive crush on Sam.

4216
04:21:29,350 --> 04:21:29,750
Understandable.

4217
04:21:31,270 --> 04:21:34,170
This guy alone is $426.

4218
04:21:37,370 --> 04:21:41,170
Our net profit, true.

4219
04:21:44,030 --> 04:21:46,410
That is insane money.

4220
04:21:47,250 --> 04:21:49,030
That's crazy money.

4221
04:21:49,670 --> 04:21:50,530
Look at him.

4222
04:21:51,250 --> 04:21:53,390
He's so cool.

4223
04:21:54,170 --> 04:21:56,970
Oh my gosh, I'm in love with this fish.

4224
04:22:06,980 --> 04:22:07,900
I love him.

4225
04:22:13,060 --> 04:22:14,480
I'm gonna sleep again.

4226
04:22:14,820 --> 04:22:18,660
I'm gonna give ourselves as much time as we can with these crab nets.

4227
04:22:20,100 --> 04:22:22,140
Ivory Impaler is a great name.

4228
04:22:22,400 --> 04:22:22,600
Right.

4229
04:22:23,700 --> 04:22:24,800
So awesome.

4230
04:22:29,040 --> 04:22:30,940
You guys, I've dredged.

4231
04:22:31,340 --> 04:22:33,300
I dredged a lot this past week.

4232
04:22:34,160 --> 04:22:36,320
But after today's stream...

4233
04:22:37,220 --> 04:22:40,600
I don't think there will be much dredging until...

4234
04:22:40,600 --> 04:22:42,160
For a little while.

4235
04:22:42,800 --> 04:22:44,420
I have no time next week.

4236
04:22:44,980 --> 04:22:46,880
What do you love more, the fish or us?

4237
04:22:50,360 --> 04:22:55,140
So yeah, I'm sorry to say we'll have to wait for the finale of dredge.

4238
04:22:57,200 --> 04:22:59,420
I'll probably do another long, long stream.

4239
04:23:02,080 --> 04:23:04,280
But that gives some people time to catch up, no?

4240
04:23:06,420 --> 04:23:07,240
Dang it.

4241
04:23:10,130 --> 04:23:11,970
Gives people some time to catch up.

4242
04:23:12,710 --> 04:23:15,370
If they couldn't watch the 10 hour...

4243
04:23:15,370 --> 04:23:17,990
It wasn't 10, it was like 8 hours of dredge.

4244
04:23:20,290 --> 04:23:22,970
Don't ask questions you don't want answers to.

4245
04:23:24,610 --> 04:23:26,530
Alright, let's check on our crabs.

4246
04:23:28,250 --> 04:23:29,490
Grabby crab crab.

4247
04:23:36,380 --> 04:23:37,500
Let's go.

4248
04:23:37,500 --> 04:23:37,600
Let's go.

4249
04:23:49,100 --> 04:23:49,900
What's that?

4250
04:23:50,160 --> 04:23:50,780
Rock crab.

4251
04:23:53,620 --> 04:23:54,100
Okay,

4252
04:23:59,880 --> 04:24:01,020
it put all of them in my thing.

4253
04:24:03,680 --> 04:24:05,700
Very nice, very nice, very nice.

4254
04:24:08,300 --> 04:24:11,860
I think the blue crab is by...

4255
04:24:13,700 --> 04:24:14,960
Is by the basin.

4256
04:24:15,100 --> 04:24:16,760
That's where we got all the blue crabs before.

4257
04:24:23,480 --> 04:24:25,280
Keep that big crab for the altar.

4258
04:24:25,880 --> 04:24:26,280
Altar?

4259
04:24:29,080 --> 04:24:29,600
Altar?

4260
04:24:31,980 --> 04:24:32,740
What altar?

4261
04:24:35,580 --> 04:24:39,400
Actually, I'm gonna undock and we're gonna go back to...

4262
04:24:46,860 --> 04:24:47,380
The...

4263
04:24:51,630 --> 04:24:52,930
The oil rig.

4264
04:24:53,930 --> 04:24:56,030
She's thinking of me, she loves me.

4265
04:24:56,450 --> 04:24:56,810
Delulu.

4266
04:24:58,010 --> 04:24:59,510
Everyone point and laugh.

4267
04:24:59,610 --> 04:25:00,710
Delulu, Delulu.

4268
04:25:02,710 --> 04:25:04,490
Delulu, Delulu, Delulu.

4269
04:25:05,830 --> 04:25:07,830
Thank you for 6 months of membership.

4270
04:25:08,170 --> 04:25:08,870
Thank you.

4271
04:25:10,090 --> 04:25:11,630
You have to manage your fuel in this.

4272
04:25:11,750 --> 04:25:11,990
No!

4273
04:25:12,630 --> 04:25:14,210
Luckily you don't have to manage fuel.

4274
04:25:19,270 --> 04:25:21,870
But there are other managing things.

4275
04:25:27,280 --> 04:25:29,500
You think I'll go super crazy this night?

4276
04:25:32,140 --> 04:25:32,580
Nah.

4277
04:25:34,520 --> 04:25:35,540
Let's just book it.

4278
04:25:37,720 --> 04:25:38,820
We should be fine.

4279
04:25:39,540 --> 04:25:41,080
Just book it, book it, book it, book it.

4280
04:25:42,760 --> 04:25:44,240
Who are you guys pointing at?

4281
04:25:50,540 --> 04:25:50,980
Yourself?

4282
04:25:51,620 --> 04:25:53,060
Are you the delusional one?

4283
04:25:54,860 --> 04:25:56,520
I may be a little delusional.

4284
04:25:59,600 --> 04:26:02,540
You guys would think so if I told you my real thoughts about Metal Gear.

4285
04:26:07,440 --> 04:26:07,880
Maybe.

4286
04:26:10,340 --> 04:26:11,840
But don't worry about it.

4287
04:26:12,180 --> 04:26:12,720
For now.

4288
04:26:13,480 --> 04:26:14,480
Wait, I need to flush the can.

4289
04:26:14,620 --> 04:26:15,500
Someone ordered it!

4290
04:26:15,640 --> 04:26:16,540
Thank you!

4291
04:26:18,540 --> 04:26:19,020
Uh-oh.

4292
04:26:19,340 --> 04:26:20,100
We're going crazy.

4293
04:26:21,420 --> 04:26:21,780
Uh-oh.

4294
04:26:22,040 --> 04:26:24,000
No, you can't be camping by the dock.

4295
04:26:24,020 --> 04:26:24,660
That's so unfair.

4296
04:26:29,780 --> 04:26:30,380
Anyway.

4297
04:26:30,860 --> 04:26:32,540
Don't worry about our mental state.

4298
04:26:33,800 --> 04:26:35,940
She's delusional and denying how cute she is.

4299
04:26:36,260 --> 04:26:37,420
You tell lies!

4300
04:26:39,060 --> 04:26:46,080
I say I'm very spooky and scary and creepy and crawly and you say I'm cute and that's none of those things.

4301
04:26:47,800 --> 04:26:49,800
You tell lies, you tell lies.

4302
04:26:52,320 --> 04:26:56,780
The scientist inserts a syringe into each of the creatures, now laying long dead on the slab.

4303
04:26:56,780 --> 04:26:59,560
From each, in turn, he draws a vial of fluid.

4304
04:27:00,400 --> 04:27:01,500
This will only take a moment.

4305
04:27:02,180 --> 04:27:08,580
Some vials contain the type of blood you might expect, deep and red, catching glints of light from the fluorescent bulbs overhead.

4306
04:27:09,120 --> 04:27:14,200
Other corpses yield a dark, clotted substance that seems to crawl up into the vial by itself.

4307
04:27:14,540 --> 04:27:17,740
It shimmers with a quiet iridescence, as if it lit from inside.

4308
04:27:18,560 --> 04:27:22,260
He places the vials of what should be fish blood in a rack in front of him.

4309
04:27:22,920 --> 04:27:25,860
Down in the deep, something begins to brush against the leg of the rig.

4310
04:27:26,780 --> 04:27:26,980
What?

4311
04:27:27,460 --> 04:27:28,980
Wait, what do you mean by that?

4312
04:27:45,140 --> 04:27:48,000
I think we released...

4313
04:27:49,580 --> 04:27:52,820
Oh my god, that's so much goop to clean up.

4314
04:27:53,040 --> 04:27:55,920
Please god no, that's so much goop.

4315
04:27:57,980 --> 04:28:01,520
There's something gigantic, something incredibly powerful gripping the rig.

4316
04:28:01,520 --> 04:28:03,020
So it's really here.

4317
04:28:03,760 --> 04:28:08,540
The scientist steps away from the nearby window, knuckles still white from gripping the frame moments before.

4318
04:28:09,720 --> 04:28:12,520
If you're so spooky, then why don't you come haunt me?

4319
04:28:12,880 --> 04:28:13,600
I will!

4320
04:28:14,200 --> 04:28:15,580
I already have.

4321
04:28:19,220 --> 04:28:22,540
Fisherman, the structure, the people on it can't stand up to this.

4322
04:28:23,640 --> 04:28:25,580
I have, well, I had a student.

4323
04:28:26,000 --> 04:28:27,620
She was developing some technology.

4324
04:28:28,220 --> 04:28:30,760
C for creepy, U for unnerving.

4325
04:28:32,180 --> 04:28:34,000
I thought you were spelling something else.

4326
04:28:34,100 --> 04:28:35,120
Scalion, oh my gosh.

4327
04:28:35,660 --> 04:28:37,420
T for terrifying, E for evil.

4328
04:28:37,800 --> 04:28:38,560
Minto is cute.

4329
04:28:50,280 --> 04:28:52,380
I can't spell.

4330
04:28:56,180 --> 04:28:58,120
How about now?

4331
04:29:00,000 --> 04:29:01,260
I can't spell.

4332
04:29:01,840 --> 04:29:03,020
I can't spell.

4333
04:29:11,080 --> 04:29:12,600
You tried.

4334
04:29:27,940 --> 04:29:31,240
He turns back and presses his forehead against the glass.

4335
04:29:31,960 --> 04:29:33,780
It was a way of communicating, I suppose.

4336
04:29:34,560 --> 04:29:37,660
We were working on emulating a language that we didn't fully understand.

4337
04:29:38,240 --> 04:29:39,580
She began to twist the words.

4338
04:29:40,880 --> 04:29:43,040
But she didn't agree with Iron Haven's methods.

4339
04:29:43,460 --> 04:29:48,840
So leveraging my role on board for the research society, I pulled some strings and had her posted far away.

4340
04:29:49,120 --> 04:29:50,260
To Stellar Basin.

4341
04:29:50,600 --> 04:29:51,780
That's his student!

4342
04:29:53,120 --> 04:29:54,360
Please go and find her.

4343
04:29:54,360 --> 04:29:57,680
I hope she's progressed her research sufficiently to help us.

4344
04:29:59,020 --> 04:30:01,400
And while you're there, try to catch some of the local specimens.

4345
04:30:03,980 --> 04:30:05,160
He's so needy.

4346
04:30:05,600 --> 04:30:07,800
I think they hold the key to understanding what we're here for.

4347
04:30:12,180 --> 04:30:13,880
I'm gonna sell some of this stuff.

4348
04:30:15,980 --> 04:30:16,460
Now

4349
04:30:31,750 --> 04:30:33,410
I am finished for today.

4350
04:30:35,250 --> 04:30:36,050
Yes, yes.

4351
04:30:37,610 --> 04:30:41,580
Thank you guys.

4352
04:30:42,460 --> 04:30:43,900
For more dredge.

4353
04:30:44,480 --> 04:30:45,620
This has been fun.

4354
04:30:46,160 --> 04:30:47,160
I like this game.

4355
04:30:47,640 --> 04:30:50,160
I could've probably gone another five hours.

4356
04:30:51,380 --> 04:30:53,260
But I should also rest.

4357
04:30:57,080 --> 04:30:59,040
Very nice streaming, though.

4358
04:30:59,240 --> 04:31:00,200
Thank you guys!

4359
04:31:05,830 --> 04:31:07,850
I hope you guys had fun.

4360
04:31:08,570 --> 04:31:09,910
I had fun.

4361
04:31:11,310 --> 04:31:16,410
I hope you guys don't mind me playing a lot of dredge recently.

4362
04:31:17,830 --> 04:31:18,750
Are you alive today?

4363
04:31:18,890 --> 04:31:20,210
I can't see your ghost horn.

4364
04:31:22,970 --> 04:31:23,650
My lady.

4365
04:31:24,310 --> 04:31:26,230
A tip of my hat to you.

4366
04:31:29,910 --> 04:31:31,790
Of course I'm not alive.

4367
04:31:32,110 --> 04:31:33,150
That would be silliness.

4368
04:31:34,750 --> 04:31:36,250
That would be ultimate silliness.

4369
04:31:37,990 --> 04:31:39,610
Thank you for the superchat!

4370
04:31:40,650 --> 04:31:45,050
We shall all tremble in fear tonight under your terrifying seat.

4371
04:31:53,680 --> 04:31:55,500
Hope you have a great day off tomorrow.

4372
04:31:55,840 --> 04:31:56,620
Thank you!

4373
04:32:04,480 --> 04:32:05,440
Nice try.

4374
04:32:09,560 --> 04:32:10,640
Thank you guys!

4375
04:32:10,740 --> 04:32:11,780
Have a good night, have a good day.

4376
04:32:12,040 --> 04:32:13,760
I'll see you guys when I see you next.

4377
04:32:13,760 --> 04:32:15,820
Thanks for fishing with me.

4378
04:32:16,360 --> 04:32:18,520
I like fish and I like fish.

4379
04:32:19,020 --> 04:32:20,520
Yeah, well played.

4380
04:32:22,920 --> 04:32:24,600
Yeah, thanks for all the fish.

4381
04:32:25,520 --> 04:32:26,240
This is so fun.

4382
04:32:26,340 --> 04:32:26,920
Thank you guys!

4383
04:32:30,460 --> 04:32:33,640
I won't see you tomorrow, unfortunately.

4384
04:32:34,440 --> 04:32:36,180
But I'll see you when I see you next.

4385
04:32:37,640 --> 04:32:38,900
Unless you're watching the bot.

4386
04:32:39,000 --> 04:32:40,040
You might see me tomorrow.

4387
04:32:41,780 --> 04:32:42,700
Bye bye!

4388
04:32:42,700 --> 04:32:43,660
Otsumito!

4389
04:32:44,080 --> 04:32:44,680
Thanks for watching!

4390
04:32:45,040 --> 04:32:45,780
Thanks for hanging out!

4391
04:32:46,060 --> 04:32:46,520
Bye bye!
