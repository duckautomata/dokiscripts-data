1
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,740
Welcome back, master and princess.

2
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,740
Hello, everybody.

3
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,680
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

4
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,320
Hello, hello.

5
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,580
Hi, Minky.

6
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
Hiya, Minto.

7
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
Hello, Minto.

8
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,200
Hello, Minky.

9
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,240
Hello, Minky Phantom Channel.

10
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,340
Hello, everybody.

11
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,620
Oh my gosh.

12
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,520
This is it.

13
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
Today is the finale.

14
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,860
The final battle of Devil May Cry 3.

15
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,380
Yippee!

16
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,860
This is the day we will...

17
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,920
I actually don't quite remember how many...

18
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,360
I was like, thinking earlier today, I was like...

19
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,780
I have five levels left?

20
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,840
I have four levels left?

21
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,380
I have five levels... I don't quite remember.

22
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
So, we're just gonna...

23
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,720
We're just gonna rock it, baby.

24
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,900
We're just gonna...

25
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,220
We're just gonna fight, fight, fight.

26
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
However many levels we've got.

27
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,840
Until we...

28
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,200
Win.

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,500
Today might be a bit of a longer stream, since it's...

30
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,940
Endurance to the end.

31
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,420
However many times it takes to beat the final boss.

32
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,700
Or any bosses.

33
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,560
Who knows?

34
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,320
Did you know this game was originally going to be DMC2?

35
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,180
But the last minute they realized they made that game once and no one liked it.

36
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,760
And everybody cried.

37
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,880
Time to fill his dark soul with light.

38
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,620
Will you play Vergil next stream?

39
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,020
What?

40
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,480
Like this game again, but as Vergil?

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,680
Or...

42
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,520
Well, I don't plan on it.

43
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,680
I was just gonna go into DMC4.

44
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,480
So, maybe someday in the future.

45
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,880
But no guarantee, I don't have any plans on it.

46
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,940
But, you know.

47
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,840
You could try him.

48
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,100
We could try him.

49
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,940
Is it the whole game again?

50
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,340
But as Vergil?

51
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,400
Or is it like a shorter version?

52
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,400
Halo, thanks for the gifted!

53
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,980
Thank you so much!

54
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,500
It's basically easy mode.

55
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
It's a little different.

56
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,140
It's easy mode though, because Vergil is so powerful, right?

57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm also powerful.

58
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,740
I can punch now.

59
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,380
And I got his fists.

60
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,000
We're fine.

61
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,240
But I imagine it has to be... It's the whole thing just without cutscenes.

62
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
But the cutscenes are so fun!

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,940
The cutscenes are so fun!

64
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,100
I wonder maybe if I could do like...

65
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,680
Doomguy!

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,980
Thank you for the Haka Super!

67
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,360
Have you made those devils cry yet?

68
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,100
Devils never cry!

69
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,720
Wait, but devils may cry.

70
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,500
Thank you so much!

71
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,880
I was gonna say, maybe we could do a stream where I go as far as I can as Vergil.

72
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,020
But I think I would do it probably after I beat the series, right?

73
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,680
It's just 4 and 5 left, so...

74
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,780
Unless I ever do DMC Devil May Cry.

75
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,840
Heads up, be careful with chat when playing DMC 4 and 5.

76
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,600
There's a lot to spoil and people will assume it's common knowledge.

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Yeah, I...

78
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,060
We have a system.

79
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,420
I guess maybe some people don't know.

80
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,340
We have a system on this channel for when there are spoilers.

81
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,880
We have the smiley face system, as you can see.

82
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,820
Some people are already implementing it!

83
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:41,120
So, if you ever see a spoiler on the chat, you do the smiley faces.

84
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,040
Because 1, it helps push the message off the screen.

85
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,900
And then 2, it also kind of indicates to me, like...

86
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,540
Oh, I see a bunch of smileys.

87
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,020
I'm not gonna look at chat because a bunch of people are smiling.

88
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,520
Which means I might accidentally see a smile...

89
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,240
Not a smile.

90
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,820
I might see a smile.

91
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,440
Not a smile.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,600
But I might see a spoiler.

93
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,600
So, it has kind of two purposes.

94
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,660
I think it's my most brilliant invention ever.

95
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,580
Greetings from Poland!

96
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,620
I collect people trying to spell my name.

97
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,800
Spell?

98
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,600
Well, it's spelled right there for me.

99
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,540
Do you mean, like, say your name?

100
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:26,580
My name?

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,420
I can attempt...

102
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,420
Yeah, okay.

103
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,140
Okay,

104
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,170
let's get into the game!

105
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,880
Where's the audio?

106
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,020
Is it here?

107
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,040
Wait, why can't I hear anything?

108
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,480
Oh, that's why.

109
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,880
There we go.

110
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,800
We're good, we're good.

111
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,220
We're good, we're good, we're good.

112
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,100
Hello ghost, hello.

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,700
Alright, last time watching this cutscene.

114
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Oh my gosh.

115
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,460
So-called legend.

116
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,320
Oh yeah.

117
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,740
He also...

118
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,820
He also fucks, apparently.

119
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,400
He has sons!

120
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,960
That's like thinking about Goofy, you know?

121
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,820
I don't want to think about it.

122
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,040
Shoutout to my boy, Jake.

123
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,820
For how great of a devoted fan he is by waking up at 4 AM.

124
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Of Perth, Australia.

125
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,200
I thank you, Mint, for being there with him.

126
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,160
Oh, it's just Jay, sorry.

127
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,280
Good morning.

128
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,140
Where's Mint?

129
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,200
Mint, where are you?

130
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,640
I love how...

131
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,300
He's too stiff.

132
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm not gonna say that, that I said last time though.

133
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,940
I learned my lesson.

134
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,960
Thanks for getting Mint-ovated.

135
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,580
Oh wait, no, time to get Mint-ovated.

136
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,620
Thanks for bringing him, thank you!

137
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,280
Devil may cry.

138
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,100
Yay!

139
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Alright, let's load our game, baby.

140
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,120
I don't know if you actually saw how Sparta looks like.

141
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,480
He does...

142
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,240
Fug.

143
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,700
Don't call him that.

144
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,440
You don't say that.

145
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,280
Don't call him fugly.

146
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,180
That's so mean.

147
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,080
Don't say that.

148
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,500
Ok, I'm guessing this is the one.

149
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,300
Alright, mission 15.

150
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,900
Clear, so we have 4.

151
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,200
Because there's 20.

152
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
I knew it was 3 or 4.

153
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,580
He did score Virgil's mom.

154
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,780
And Dante's?

155
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,140
20 minus 15 equals 5.

156
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,380
We're on 16.

157
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,280
Oh wait, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

158
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,420
Ok, let's just...

159
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,590
Load.

160
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,170
What did I press wrong?

161
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,670
This one.

162
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,490
Yes, load successful.

163
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,470
Load!

164
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,510
Load the game!

165
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,070
Oh, I accidentally pressed...

166
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,010
Ok, just kidding.

167
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,610
Ok, this is...we have to look for 16 everybody.

168
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,430
We're glitching out!

169
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,910
Oh no, I hate these guys.

170
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,550
Please spare me.

171
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,010
No, please.

172
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,050
I'm looking for 16.

173
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,590
That's my sweet...what?

174
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,500
What?

175
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,720
Where was it?

176
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,780
The gun flash?

177
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,820
I didn't see it at all.

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,520
In the gun flash, I was going blind and they expect me to see it?

179
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,020
What the hell?

180
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,060
Ok, let's check again how many rorbs we got.

181
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,380
16,000 rorbs.

182
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,680
Ok, Beowulf.

183
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,280
We can afford the straight too.

184
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,020
We got the air hike.

185
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,800
I've been using rebellion pretty consistently.

186
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,400
I switch between rebellion and agony sometimes.

187
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,260
Agni Rudra.

188
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,900
We could also get the jet stream too.

189
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,020
An air hike on here?

190
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,380
No, we can't get an air hike on here.

191
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm a liar.

192
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,160
I'm a liar.

193
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,760
Glad to hear you considering DMC Devil May Cry.

194
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:33,780
I'd recommend playing between 4 and 5 as 5 has funny responses to the design choices of DMC's El Exterminador de Demonios.

195
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,280
Have fun.

196
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,100
Thank you.

197
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,920
Let's just get into it.

198
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,120
And see...wait, wait, wait.

199
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,160
What can we buy in terms of...

200
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,880
Nothing.

201
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,680
We can buy no blorbs.

202
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,980
We can buy no porbs.

203
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,220
So sad.

204
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,690
Ok, we are going to be right into it, aren't we?

205
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,710
Hold on.

206
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,780
It's my birthday!

207
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,500
Happy birthday!

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,620
Why does it have no name?

209
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,160
It's anonymous.

210
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,640
Hold on.

211
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm learning how to play the game again.

212
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:20,980
One second.

213
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,080
I saw those guys.

214
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,140
Where did they go to?

215
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Ok.

216
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,180
Happy birthday to you.

217
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,100
Happy birthday to you.

218
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,800
Happy birthday dear anonymous.

219
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,900
Happy birthday to you.

220
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,020
Happy birthday!

221
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
Ok.

222
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,340
Gone.

223
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,100
Attack.

224
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,700
Attack.

225
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,300
Alright.

226
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,700
Did we just open this?

227
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,000
Shoot you guys.

228
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,920
I can't remember what the hell happened last time.

229
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,860
We have the play button and the pause button.

230
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,080
We are going down.

231
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,200
Why can't I remember anything that happened last time?

232
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,260
Oh, whoops.

233
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,860
Why can't I remember anything?

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,800
Map?

235
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,220
Bad memory?

236
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,020
Clearly.

237
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,460
Ok, we opened this up.

238
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,720
We opened this up last time.

239
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,640
We went a bunch of places.

240
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,180
The map is useless.

241
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,440
Yeah, I'm kind of feeling that way.

242
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm going through the red door.

243
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,780
I'm going back through the red door.

244
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,360
How do I... Gosh, why am I so...

245
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,820
What's wrong with me today?

246
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,600
Sorry.

247
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,240
Hold on.

248
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,980
I'm getting my bearings.

249
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,820
What the... Ok.

250
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,020
We're here.

251
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,680
We're here.

252
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,340
Alright.

253
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:27,920
Ok.

254
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,060
Ok.

255
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,020
Oh shoot.

256
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,900
Dang, guys.

257
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,800
Everything is so mysterious.

258
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,700
There is still somebody.

259
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,640
Sorry, am I ignoring you?

260
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,860
Are you lonely?

261
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,920
Stinger!

262
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,940
Stinger!

263
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,540
Stinger!

264
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,040
Oh.

265
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,880
Oh, this looks new.

266
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,760
What is this?

267
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,540
He who pursues the Onyx Moonshard makes all the spheres.

268
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:51,940
What?

269
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,010
Ok.

270
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,790
Ok.

271
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,050
I'm on top of the ball.

272
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,430
Do I hit it?

273
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,110
What the hell am I doing?

274
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,790
Oh wait.

275
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,090
Do I need to break these?

276
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,690
Wait, what was... Hold on.

277
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,030
Or...

278
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,110
He who pursues the Onyx Moonshard makes all the spheres.

279
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,750
Do I have to combine them?

280
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,470
Alright, guys.

281
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,250
The balls must touch.

282
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,170
The balls touch, right?

283
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,610
That will make them whole again.

284
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,110
No.

285
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,510
Ok.

286
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,350
No!

287
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,410
Not hot dogs!

288
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,190
Didn't mean to donate anonymously.

289
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,610
No!

290
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,070
Thank you for the... Sorry.

291
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,090
Yuko didn't have to donate so much again.

292
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,970
Oh my gosh.

293
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,990
Please, Dante.

294
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,110
Ok.

295
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:11,710
Alright.

296
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,550
Hit.

297
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,950
Oh nice.

298
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,730
Good one, good one.

299
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,470
Forward now.

300
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:16,870
What?

301
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,390
Ok.

302
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,430
They are rocking.

303
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,630
Rocking balls.

304
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,070
Ok.

305
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,870
Now, you over here.

306
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,490
Also.

307
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,770
Rock.

308
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,590
Momentum!

309
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,030
Momentum!

310
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,390
Oh!

311
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,590
Oh my gosh.

312
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,050
This is not very good.

313
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,370
Oh my gosh.

314
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:39,750
That was good.

315
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,110
That was good.

316
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,530
That was good.

317
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,250
That was good.

318
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,650
That was good.

319
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,550
Please don't go up.

320
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,450
Please don't go up.

321
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,550
We were so close.

322
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,840
No breakdown.

323
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,540
That's what I'm gonna have trying to get these...

324
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,160
I am doing the right thing, right?

325
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,500
The balls need to touch, right?

326
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,620
That's the correct thing?

327
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,750
Ok.

328
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,570
And... Hit!

329
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,570
Hit!

330
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,970
Please, please.

331
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,770
Hit the balls.

332
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,790
Oh my gosh.

333
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,750
I don't even have these.

334
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,930
I don't know how to use them.

335
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:25,870
Ok.

336
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,330
Oh my gosh.

337
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,750
Please.

338
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,630
Why don't they keep enough momentum?

339
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,230
Go!

340
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,190
Hit!

341
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:32,850
Please!

342
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,510
Please hit!

343
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,830
Oh my gosh.

344
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,050
Please!

345
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,130
Oh my gosh.

346
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,050
No!

347
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,910
Maybe a different weapon would be better.

348
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,530
What a time to join the stream.

349
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,130
Welcome!

350
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,550
Thanks Chips for the superchat.

351
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:20,850
Maybe...

352
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,410
I don't know.

353
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,910
I don't think punching them would help.

354
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,010
Oh my goodness.

355
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,510
Ok.

356
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,670
Agni and Rudra?

357
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,190
Ok, ok.

358
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,910
Am I allowed to have more than one Vtuber Kamiyoshi?

359
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,190
Wait.

360
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,250
I think it's all up to however you wanna enjoy stuff.

361
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,170
Holy moly!

362
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,770
Oh my god!

363
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,120
Oh my god!

364
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,600
It was so easy for them!

365
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,000
What the hell?

366
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,040
Why was it so easy?

367
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,780
Onyx Moon Shard.

368
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,280
A sculpture etched in the shape of an onyx moon.

369
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,100
It contrasts the golden sun sculpture.

370
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
I knew it.

371
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,380
I was gonna say, now we are gonna get trapped in here.

372
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:25,780
Right?

373
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,160
Who's here?

374
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,960
Oh my god.

375
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,340
No!

376
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,380
No please!

377
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,640
Oh my god.

378
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,600
No, no, no.

379
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,420
No, please.

380
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,280
Oh my god.

381
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,360
I'm wasting my DT.

382
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,840
I'm absolutely wasting my...

383
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,040
What was the best thing to do for these guys?

384
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,940
God!

385
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,140
You stupid bastard!

386
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,900
Ow!

387
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,340
Nice dodge.

388
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,700
Oh, ouch.

389
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,760
Oh my god.

390
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,160
I hate these guys so much!

391
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,140
Stop Dante!

392
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,340
These guys are the actual worst.

393
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,820
Oh my god.

394
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,960
Oh my god.

395
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,200
Oh please.

396
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,680
Let me out.

397
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,220
Maybe...

398
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,920
Ice, baby.

399
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,740
Maybe...

400
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,240
Ice would be better.

401
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,220
Yeah!

402
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,480
Yeah!

403
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,560
Yeah!

404
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:47,760
Yeah!

405
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,660
Chew on this!

406
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,460
Yeah!

407
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,740
It's cool!

408
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:53,740
Yeah!

409
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Yeah!

410
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,260
Chew on this!

411
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,860
It's cool!

412
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,320
It's not cool.

413
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,380
Yeah!

414
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,080
It's cool!

415
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,860
Oh my god.

416
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,270
Oh my god.

417
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,690
Where are you?

418
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,750
You're in the ground?

419
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:14,550
Hello?

420
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:14,610
Hello?

421
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,850
Oh my god.

422
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,350
Meow!

423
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,030
Meow!

424
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,090
Oh, that was close.

425
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:24,850
Oh my god.

426
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,230
Please!

427
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,050
You too!

428
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,570
Can I...

429
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,010
Yeah!

430
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,550
Chew on this!

431
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,690
Ouch!

432
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,070
Fist them.

433
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,650
Should I try Beowulf instead?

434
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,210
Go to hell!

435
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,490
Go to hell!

436
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:48,930
Ouch!

437
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,410
How am I supposed to...

438
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:53,990
Oh my god.

439
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,020
Oh my god.

440
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,520
I don't know if I'm gonna make it, you guys!

441
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,080
I don't know how to beat this!

442
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,760
I don't know how to use Beowulf at all.

443
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,390
I'll try anything!

444
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,370
At this point!

445
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,470
Please!

446
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,890
No, Dante!

447
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,110
Why are you in the wall?

448
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,910
Please just die!

449
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,410
Please just die!

450
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:28,950
Please just die!

451
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,190
I'm in time.

452
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,350
So are they!

453
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:43,890
Dante!

454
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,630
Why are you in the wall?

455
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,110
Oh my god.

456
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,930
Get out of the...

457
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,360
I think I killed... No, I'm just kidding.

458
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,400
I thought I did.

459
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,200
Oh my god!

460
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,620
I'm gonna die because of your stupid ass!

461
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,480
I just started the game!

462
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,060
I don't want to touch the balls again!

463
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,480
At least Agni and Rudra made it really easy though.

464
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,880
Oh my god.

465
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,120
One HP in a dream, real?

466
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,540
Oh my god.

467
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,840
How am I still alive, baby?

468
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,900
I'm just gonna keep punching them.

469
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,680
Golly!

470
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,600
Oh, ok.

471
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,420
Alright.

472
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,380
Nevermind.

473
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,280
Ouch!

474
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,860
Can you get out of the wall, you son of a bitch!

475
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,540
Oh, I tried dodging that.

476
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,160
I really did.

477
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,340
Nice.

478
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,780
Good job, Dante.

479
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,220
Oh, no!

480
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,240
Come on.

481
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,980
Get out of the wall.

482
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,180
Oh my god!

483
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,160
I'm gonna become the Joker for real.

484
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,100
Please!

485
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,340
Please!

486
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,200
Just die!

487
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh god!

488
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,980
I hate these guys!

489
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Get

490
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,260
out of the wall!

491
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,780
I love when they take collateral damage.

492
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,680
I hate

493
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,550
these guys more than anything!

494
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:22,330
Just punch his ass!

495
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,030
Oh my god!

496
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,350
Oh my god!

497
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,520
Nice.

498
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,410
I hate that there are no I-frames in this game.

499
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,810
Like there are, but you know what I mean.

500
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,310
I get hit and I'm immediately comboed because this game is fucking ass!

501
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,450
Fuck you!

502
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,550
You stupid ass, stupid angels!

503
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,550
Oh my god!

504
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,310
Go!

505
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,630
Go!

506
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:05,970
Go!

507
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,430
Go!

508
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:06,630
Go!

509
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,490
Oh my god!

510
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,160
Why don't you give me health, you stingy!

511
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,320
Also, hi Cinder!

512
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Cinder, don't look!

513
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,020
Cinder, don't look!

514
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,420
You're seeing... I'm usually...

515
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,560
I'm usually OK.

516
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,520
It's just these guys.

517
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,020
They suck.

518
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,680
I just spit my tea all over the players.

519
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,040
Hold on.

520
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
I'm cleaning up my...

521
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,040
Ew!

522
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,300
I have a towel.

523
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,780
Hold on.

524
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,760
I was so...

525
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,940
But I still kept going even when I had something in my mouth.

526
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,560
OK, we got that Onix, moon Onix shard.

527
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,120
Let's go.

528
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
Let's get the heck out!

529
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,380
Oh no!

530
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,780
Oh, sheesh.

531
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,900
You too.

532
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,620
You too.

533
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,020
Don't attack me.

534
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,520
Can we switch to you?

535
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,720
No.

536
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,240
Switch to you.

537
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,820
Switch to you.

538
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,860
Can we switch to you?

539
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,960
Switch to you.

540
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,440
No!

541
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Stop jumping away!

542
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,140
Two on this.

543
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,240
OK.

544
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,260
Let's go to this guy instead.

545
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,420
Nice!

546
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,240
I remember that thing.

547
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,360
That move saved my butt.

548
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
And that one boss...

549
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,480
Drinks tea angrily.

550
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,340
I did!

551
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,820
Holy moly.

552
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,320
Alright.

553
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,300
This is...

554
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,850
This is where we came from.

555
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,330
Where are we?

556
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,910
This is where we went and got the shard.

557
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,550
This is...

558
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,650
We came through the red door.

559
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,070
And then... What's this door?

560
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,170
I'm gonna punch him.

561
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,550
Before they start making more guys!

562
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,230
Oh gosh.

563
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,070
No, no, no.

564
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:51,890
That's not what I meant to do.

565
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,970
I meant to...

566
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,570
Do this.

567
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,130
Oh gosh.

568
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,690
Go to heal!

569
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,230
Kill him!

570
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,550
Kill his ass!

571
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,710
Take him down!

572
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,310
Leave no survivors!

573
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,730
Nice!

574
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,110
We actually did that.

575
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,300
You!

576
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:25,720
Yeah.

577
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,140
One

578
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:38,810
more.

579
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,290
Please!

580
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,910
I'm gonna...

581
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,810
Do this instead.

582
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,750
There are so many guys.

583
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,690
I feel like I should...

584
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,190
Thank you!

585
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,090
Idiot!

586
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,390
I was like, oh you are gonna jump huh?

587
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,150
I got you in the air!

588
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,230
Devil star!

589
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,430
I've been in here before, haven't I?

590
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,610
I do remember...

591
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,510
This is where the other ball was that I had to defeat.

592
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,510
I'm a little late.

593
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,070
You got this, Mito.

594
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:15,930
Thank you, Casey!

595
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,370
No worries.

596
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,810
I started so early today.

597
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,850
I started so early today.

598
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,550
I guess we are farming roars, which is kinda nice.

599
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,470
Not if I can help it!

600
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,850
We got fancy stuff.

601
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,650
I should double kill him.

602
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:41,530
Nice.

603
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,450
Take this guy out.

604
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,720
Nice!

605
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,620
So good.

606
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,160
Come on!

607
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,280
Die already!

608
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,500
No!

609
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,100
No, no, no!

610
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,220
Stop him.

611
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,060
Stop his combo.

612
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,800
Stop his combo.

613
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,900
Okay.

614
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:18,620
Alright.

615
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,960
We can go back through now.

616
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,600
Now we go to the blue door.

617
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,400
Let's kill.

618
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,340
What was I getting these for, though?

619
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,730
I can't remember at all, you guys.

620
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,970
No, no, no!

621
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,070
There we go.

622
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,540
Nice!

623
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:02,960
Yeah.

624
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,200
I love Stinger!

625
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Thanks for saving me the time.

626
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,460
Oh, a roar.

627
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,200
I almost missed.

628
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
Nice hit.

629
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,840
Let's take care of that.

630
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
No, no, no!

631
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,460
This one!

632
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,240
The immediate one right in front of me!

633
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,120
No, this one!

634
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,580
Oh god!

635
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,300
This one!

636
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,080
Oh god!

637
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,680
Just take him out!

638
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,300
Just take him out!

639
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,560
While you can!

640
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,880
Maybe I didn't need to do that actually, but it's okay.

641
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,520
Oh please.

642
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,520
Just take him out!

643
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,160
Just take him out!

644
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,240
Oh gosh.

645
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,600
It's okay.

646
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,580
No, no, no!

647
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,760
Don't hit them!

648
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,440
Don't hit them!

649
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:20,860
Don't hit them!

650
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:22,940
Okay.

651
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,300
Can I get this one?

652
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,080
This one instead.

653
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,160
He is right here.

654
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:32,660
Okay.

655
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,680
Oh shoot!

656
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,320
Oh shoot!

657
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:35,960
Okay.

658
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:36,860
Shoot!

659
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,100
Shoot!

660
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,360
Shoot!

661
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:37,820
Not you!

662
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,480
Not you!

663
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:38,720
You!

664
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:38,840
You!

665
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:38,980
You!

666
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,120
You!

667
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,380
Okay.

668
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,460
One at a time!

669
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,000
Nice!

670
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,660
Okay.

671
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,760
I think that's all of them.

672
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm just gonna punch you.

673
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm just gonna...

674
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,220
Oh, cool.

675
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,600
And I'm gonna punch the other guy that's over here.

676
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,280
Where are you?

677
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,340
You're here?

678
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,240
Yeah.

679
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,740
He's almost donezo.

680
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:02,820
Oh!

681
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,960
It's tough when you have to like mix them up, you know?

682
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,560
It's just like, okay, I'm gonna shoot these guys, take down these guys.

683
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,680
I guess I could've taken down the guys.

684
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,640
But I'm just... I'm just... I'm just a ghost, okay?

685
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,660
Doing my best.

686
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Alright, that was from the puzzle we did before.

687
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,920
So now we go through the door?

688
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,100
I'm out of breath.

689
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,340
Waking Sun Chamber.

690
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,300
I can't see anything.

691
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,780
What is this?

692
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,960
He who pursues the eternal power of the golden sun, release me from the darkness.

693
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,700
You?

694
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,280
Which way?

695
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,460
Which way do you swing?

696
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,720
Which way do you swing?

697
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,620
Oh, I think I just have to release you from the thing.

698
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,720
I just have to break it, I think.

699
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,580
I thought I was trying to break the wall.

700
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:36,840
We did it.

701
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,440
Nice.

702
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,980
The golden sun.

703
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,700
A sculpture etched in the shape of a golden sun.

704
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,180
It contrasts the onyx moon shard sculpture.

705
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,840
It looks delicious.

706
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,700
Please, no.

707
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,500
God, please no more angels.

708
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,220
What the hell is that?

709
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,680
What the hell is this?

710
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,120
What is this?

711
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Watch out, watch out.

712
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,460
Dante.

713
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,540
Interesting.

714
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,780
Ok, he goes down.

715
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:32,940
I got him.

716
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,530
I don't know how to play chess.

717
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,250
Oh gosh.

718
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,170
Oh gosh, Dante.

719
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,010
I'm gonna DT again.

720
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:53,770
The horse.

721
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,330
The horse.

722
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,890
Oh my god, seriously, the worst timing.

723
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,270
Watch out, watch out, watch out, Dante.

724
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:13,310
I would much rather face these though than even one angel.

725
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,330
Angel.

726
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,590
The horse is...

727
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,190
Oh gosh, I'm always stuck in a combo.

728
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,050
And I can't get out before they start.

729
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,110
Let's do maybe this instead.

730
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,430
More?

731
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,570
Start blasting.

732
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,650
Oh my gosh, Dante.

733
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:49,850
Oh...

734
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,750
Good airline for a trip to Japan.

735
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,230
I think it really depends on...

736
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,150
What you're kinda trying to get out of your airline.

737
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,830
I think like Zip-Air or whatever is supposed to be pretty good if you want a really cheap trip.

738
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,370
You just have to bring your own food.

739
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,070
B-Y-O-F Ahem.

740
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,290
Okay.

741
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,770
Bionic Hippo, thanks for the 10 gifted.

742
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,510
Let's get out of here.

743
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,190
Living statues no more.

744
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,310
I leave, I leave, I leave.

745
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,890
Now I have the two things.

746
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,490
And I'm just gonna run for it.

747
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,250
I can't see.

748
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,050
Okay, bye.

749
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,690
Sun and moon chamber.

750
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,190
Now I have them for this.

751
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,030
The door is firmly sealed.

752
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,450
The two holes are collars into the door.

753
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,770
The sun and moon crest are etched above the door.

754
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,330
And go this way.

755
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,650
And open up.

756
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,910
The orange and banana.

757
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,550
Ice guardian.

758
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,990
That doesn't sound very good.

759
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:19,670
I can't see.

760
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,370
What is here?

761
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,930
Oh, screw this.

762
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:23,390
I hate.

763
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,450
I hate everything.

764
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,190
I HATE EVERYTHING.

765
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,310
I got him.

766
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,490
I got him just in time.

767
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,350
Wait, I don't think I...

768
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,810
Ah, there's also an... Oh my god, I can't believe you're here too.

769
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,430
Oh, wait, I did it again.

770
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,250
I'm such a dummy.

771
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:47,410
I'm such a...

772
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:47,670
Dumb.

773
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,310
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

774
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,790
No, get away.

775
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,850
This is not your fight.

776
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:57,810
Gosh.

777
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:01,990
Stop

778
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,420
your ass.

779
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,600
Oh my god, I can't see.

780
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,400
I can't.

781
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,080
I can't.

782
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,080
What the hell is going on here?

783
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,080
Oh, please.

784
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,160
I can't.

785
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,980
I can see that.

786
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,260
Oh my god, this is the worst camera angle in the world.

787
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,640
No.

788
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,700
Oh my god.

789
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,600
I feel like I'm only just yelling today.

790
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,920
I'm so sorry, you guys.

791
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,680
I'm a little stressed by this game, if you couldn't tell.

792
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,520
Holy moly.

793
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,460
Any hidden orbs anywhere?

794
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,940
I didn't like this part at all.

795
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,120
I wish this to never be...

796
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,220
Why do they keep... Why do they keep... Why do they keep doing this to us?

797
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,420
Oh my god.

798
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,620
Oh my god.

799
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:09,920
No!

800
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,380
You son of a bitch!

801
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,100
You son of...

802
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,000
No, no, no.

803
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,920
Please send me back.

804
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,320
I'm running.

805
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,620
I'm leaving.

806
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:22,720
I'm running!

807
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,360
Endless Infernum is right.

808
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,740
Thanks for the salt.

809
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,040
Holy cow.

810
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,000
How's my health doing any...

811
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,520
That's not what I meant to do.

812
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,460
That's okay.

813
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,320
What the heck is this?

814
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:46,980
Artemis.

815
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:52,320
A gun of the demon world that discharges arrows concentrated with demon energy.

816
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
It's not a...

817
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,280
No way.

818
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,980
No way!

819
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,800
No, please.

820
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,300
It's the doors right here.

821
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:12,840
It's fine.

822
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,140
No, no, no.

823
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,380
I have to go back up.

824
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,120
No!

825
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,080
Oh my god.

826
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,100
What do you mean Minto?

827
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,600
How was I supposed to know?

828
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,560
I didn't know!

829
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,560
I didn't know!

830
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,500
I didn't know!

831
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,040
Get me out of here!

832
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,000
Get me out!

833
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,560
Get me up!

834
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,100
Get me up!

835
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,360
Okay, I'm just going to run past these guys.

836
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,600
Wait, what's over here though?

837
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:44,860
Anything?

838
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:45,840
No?

839
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,400
Okay.

840
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,880
Okay.

841
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,700
Okay.

842
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,340
Don't fall down.

843
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,280
Understood.

844
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,380
Okay, what does this say?

845
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,120
Nothing.

846
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,740
I'm illiterate.

847
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,280
Okay, into the door!

848
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,820
It's a long chapter.

849
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:13,660
Oh no.

850
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,900
Oh, I'm in here now!

851
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,080
This is where we fought the worm!

852
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,300
Oh gosh.

853
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,180
Oh no, no, no.

854
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,080
Run, run, run, run.

855
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,700
What's the purple smog?

856
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,520
Five!

857
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,260
Guys, I think I'm lost.

858
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,760
A centipede.

859
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,440
Sorry, I called it a worm.

860
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,060
I'm going the right way?

861
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,580
Okay, I'll trust you.

862
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,420
Surely, I won't get one guy.

863
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,840
I can't see anything.

864
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,280
I love running into the darkness.

865
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,760
How many...

866
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,220
18,000.

867
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,920
I really didn't get that much.

868
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,540
Felt like I farmed forever.

869
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,580
Okay, well...

870
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,360
It's straight.

871
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,580
Good.

872
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:09,860
Hold on.

873
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,200
I'm holding my drink.

874
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,320
A stinger, but with my fist?

875
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,220
I prefer staff.

876
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:36,310
Lunged forward and punched the enemy upward into the sky.

877
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,030
Stinger, but shorter.

878
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,770
We'll still save for now.

879
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,290
Oh gosh, I hurt.

880
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,430
What the heck?

881
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,710
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

882
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,330
Thank you so much.

883
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:51,430
Lady!

884
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,280
Shut up.

885
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,840
It's her papa.

886
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,420
Her motivation.

887
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,480
Us too though.

888
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,280
Did you forget that we're also...

889
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,120
We also have family in here?

890
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,700
Yeah, we're not your enemy.

891
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,240
Why can't we work together?

892
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,160
Wait.

893
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,400
No way.

894
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,440
The books.

895
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,240
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

896
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,720
Are you kidding me right now?

897
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,440
Oh shoot.

898
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,580
Lady, we can talk this through.

899
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,480
Oh god!

900
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,560
Get ready for what?

901
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,200
Ok, hold on.

902
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:25,700
Where are you?

903
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,340
Where did you go lady?

904
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,260
Hide and seek.

905
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,340
I also got guns.

906
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,100
Oh my god.

907
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,200
My stinger.

908
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,540
This music.

909
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,000
It's so funky.

910
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,360
Where'd she go?

911
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:13,110
Oh there she is.

912
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,930
She's trying to find me.

913
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,890
I'll see her though.

914
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:16,970
Come around the corner.

915
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,210
There she is.

916
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:23,990
Oh wow.

917
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,870
How could you miss?

918
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,900
Maybe trickster would be good here.

919
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,660
She's got such sass.

920
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,600
Oh my gosh.

921
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,340
She's so good at dodging.

922
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,600
Get ready.

923
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,050
These guys instead.

924
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,870
Ok.

925
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,470
Come on, wimp.

926
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,270
I hate this map.

927
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:18,510
Oh my god.

928
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,510
Oh my... Oh you...

929
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,410
I can't... I can't... I don't know where you are.

930
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,410
This sucks.

931
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,810
My new gu... Oh yeah, that's right.

932
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,270
I got a new gun, didn't I?

933
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,400
Get ready.

934
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,960
Why did I do that?

935
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,060
Dodge!

936
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,500
Dodge!

937
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,680
I

938
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,000
could not use that.

939
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,440
Damn, this thing is good.

940
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,980
Oh my god.

941
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,580
What's happening?

942
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:02,700
Where are you?

943
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,180
I can't tell anything at all.

944
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,260
Where are you?

945
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,840
I'm using this to heal.

946
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,280
Oh my god.

947
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,720
Oh my god.

948
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,700
I'm using this to heal.

949
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,980
And it's gone now.

950
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,580
Oh shoot.

951
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,320
I am using trickster.

952
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,440
What are you talking about?

953
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh my goodness.

954
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,300
Get down from there.

955
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,280
They are grenades.

956
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,460
Oh my gosh.

957
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,180
I can't even tell what she is doing because this map is shit.

958
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,780
Oh yeah.

959
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,200
Come on, please.

960
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,180
Oh god.

961
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,480
Oh god.

962
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:50,720
Oh god.

963
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,400
Come down.

964
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,000
Is this phase 2 technically?

965
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,780
Like where she doesn't drop down stairs anymore?

966
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,620
There is a higher ground.

967
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,380
I'm trying to... I'm trying to find her.

968
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:25,940
Oh my gosh.

969
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,960
She is so fast.

970
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,440
Can she...

971
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,180
She takes a lot of... She eats my damage.

972
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,700
What the hell are those?

973
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,560
Maybe I can get her now though.

974
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,120
Oh my god.

975
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,600
Die you!

976
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,180
Die you!

977
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,700
Die you!

978
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,440
Die you!

979
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:55,960
Die you!

980
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,680
Die you!

981
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,040
Die you!

982
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,440
Die you!

983
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:57,940
Die you!

984
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,160
Die you!

985
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,040
Come here!

986
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,160
Come here!

987
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,420
Come here!

988
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,380
Come here lady!

989
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:00,800
Come here!

990
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,020
Come here!

991
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,380
Yeah, I'm a little bit scared lady.

992
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,860
Oh my god!

993
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,390
OK.

994
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:14,750
OK.

995
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,550
Now that I know how she works...

996
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,530
We got this.

997
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,950
Wait.

998
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,010
Oh, that's right.

999
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,630
She is right there.

1000
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:25,010
OK.

1001
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:25,890
I was like, wait a second.

1002
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:27,770
Alright, let's skip.

1003
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,850
And we are gonna do... I like these guys here.

1004
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,630
She is coming.

1005
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:34,910
Run after her!

1006
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:35,810
Run after her!

1007
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:36,390
No!

1008
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:36,730
No!

1009
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:36,890
No!

1010
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,530
Am I on a trickster?

1011
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,450
Trickster.

1012
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:41,750
Oh shoot!

1013
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,170
Oh shoot!

1014
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:44,990
Shoot!

1015
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:45,430
No!

1016
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,330
Oh my god.

1017
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,110
She is...

1018
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,110
OK.

1019
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:49,170
OK.

1020
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:56,890
And I run too.

1021
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,890
And I run too.

1022
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:58,890
And I run too.

1023
00:55:59,150 --> 00:55:59,790
Running around.

1024
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:00,710
Where are you at?

1025
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:01,570
Lady!

1026
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:03,690
Get ready.

1027
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,260
Oh my god.

1028
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,480
Oh my god.

1029
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,100
That was a close one.

1030
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,780
Oh my god.

1031
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,600
I can never get her in time.

1032
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,180
I can never get her in time.

1033
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,660
Where are you?

1034
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,440
Oh, there you are.

1035
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,600
No!

1036
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:21,860
No!

1037
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,120
No!

1038
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:22,580
No!

1039
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:22,820
No!

1040
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,200
No!

1041
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,420
No!

1042
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:23,560
No!

1043
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,220
No!

1044
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,480
No!

1045
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,340
No!

1046
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:25,580
No!

1047
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:25,780
No!

1048
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:25,980
No!

1049
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,400
No!

1050
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,600
No!

1051
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:26,620
No!

1052
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:26,760
No!

1053
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:26,840
No!

1054
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:26,920
No!

1055
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,360
Come here!

1056
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:32,850
My rage.

1057
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,410
Huge damage baby!

1058
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,150
Come here!

1059
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:42,950
Come here!

1060
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,090
I don't...

1061
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:48,660
Sorry.

1062
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:55,310
Where are you going?

1063
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,090
Oh, I heard her.

1064
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:57,150
Nevermind.

1065
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:58,510
I heard...

1066
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,130
I heard her though.

1067
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:01,510
I didn't.

1068
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,210
Yeah, there she is.

1069
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:06,290
Yeah!

1070
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,170
Big damage!

1071
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:08,230
Big damage!

1072
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:09,530
And...

1073
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:15,750
I forgot I wasn't on sword.

1074
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,710
Are you still there?

1075
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:21,470
Nice.

1076
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,310
It's over.

1077
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,130
OK.

1078
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,910
Where did she go?

1079
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:32,250
Nice.

1080
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,070
She's so fast.

1081
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:34,950
Come here!

1082
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,350
With your nimble legs!

1083
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,130
Lady!

1084
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,150
So close.

1085
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:41,850
There we go!

1086
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:42,250
There we go!

1087
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:44,690
Just a little bit at least.

1088
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:46,690
Oh my God.

1089
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:47,950
Where is it coming from?

1090
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,310
I don't know where it's coming from.

1091
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,910
I found it.

1092
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:56,890
No!

1093
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,130
No!

1094
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:57,290
No!

1095
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:57,430
No!

1096
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:57,570
No!

1097
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:57,870
No!

1098
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:57,950
No!

1099
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:58,210
No!

1100
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,050
I'm not eating anything.

1101
00:57:59,390 --> 00:57:59,850
I'm full.

1102
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:00,930
I've had my fill.

1103
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:01,710
Thank you Lady.

1104
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:02,050
Goodbye!

1105
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:02,290
Goodbye!

1106
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:02,450
Goodbye!

1107
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,740
Oh my God.

1108
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,080
Why couldn't her aim be like that while I'm fighting her?

1109
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:27,430
Dante!

1110
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,230
Why do you care so much?

1111
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,170
Oh my gosh.

1112
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:31,670
Dante, no!

1113
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,330
Sorry guys.

1114
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,370
I think it's the coffee that I had that's making me all like...

1115
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,890
I'll stop drinking it.

1116
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,270
Oh my gosh.

1117
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,830
I think it's...

1118
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:53,470
It's not that it's a regular coffee.

1119
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,910
I got an espresso and it's making me...

1120
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,170
Oh man.

1121
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,730
I'm like...

1122
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,130
I'm like crazy shaking.

1123
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,110
Come on.

1124
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,210
We can work together.

1125
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,890
Why don't you...

1126
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,970
No way.

1127
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:22,670
A kiss.

1128
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:23,870
A kiss.

1129
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,950
I love

1130
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,100
in these types of games.

1131
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,640
It's always like a violent fight that just brings you together, you know?

1132
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,700
Almost killing each other really just increases the bond.

1133
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,160
Where are we gonna put this?

1134
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,400
I don't have a pocket big enough for this gun.

1135
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,660
Those are dumb shonen rules.

1136
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,320
So true.

1137
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:55,760
Wait.

1138
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,960
Tell us your real name.

1139
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,180
Maybe she likes going by lady.

1140
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,040
Aww, lady.

1141
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,210
Aww, lady!

1142
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,450
My name is Adamska.

1143
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,630
Kalina Anne.

1144
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:24,230
A gun with lady's mother's name etched into the handle.

1145
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:26,190
It has various...

1146
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,810
I did not read that as uses.

1147
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,470
And I almost read it again as the same thing.

1148
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:38,410
I thought it said various issues.

1149
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,300
I was like dang.

1150
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,620
She's got a lot of issues, man.

1151
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,100
Kalina Anne.

1152
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,220
That's so pretty.

1153
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,860
Gosh, this chapter is so long.

1154
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,020
We have all the guns.

1155
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,680
Yippee!

1156
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,680
I was gonna say there was a gun we missed though, wasn't there?

1157
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,720
But I'm thinking of DMC2 if I...

1158
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,880
I think so.

1159
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,260
I remember this area.

1160
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:23,060
Oh,

1161
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:26,860
Dante!

1162
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,720
Dante, grab on!

1163
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,290
Hyper Minto is best Minto.

1164
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:37,390
Sorry, it's really the Espresso.

1165
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:42,650
Yeah!

1166
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,320
Mission clear!

1167
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,040
40 minutes!

1168
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,920
Captain Aminto is extra silly and cute.

1169
01:01:59,180 --> 01:01:59,380
Oh!

1170
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,400
I forgot to save.

1171
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,740
That's one freaky Espresso.

1172
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,080
I think it was an Espresso.

1173
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,120
Pretty sure.

1174
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,980
It was like an Espresso shot in it.

1175
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,220
I just wanted to try it because it sounded yummy.

1176
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,420
It's not actually that great.

1177
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:16,740
It's okay though.

1178
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,160
Welcome to my workshop.

1179
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,420
Thank you.

1180
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,680
Boo, Baldi.

1181
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,780
Boo, you wish you were as cool as Volgin.

1182
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,860
You're just a skinny guy.

1183
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,060
He's got our necklaces.

1184
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,390
His face.

1185
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:05,170
Wow, it didn't even leave a scratch.

1186
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,590
I think this is bad news bears.

1187
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,090
I think this might be a bad thing.

1188
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,840
Mission 7.

1189
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,620
Oh, I missed it.

1190
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,800
Was it in the trees?

1191
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,020
Inner Demons, confront your shadow.

1192
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:42,590
Almost 30.

1193
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:44,610
We could get more DT.

1194
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,650
Might be good to have.

1195
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:49,990
Oh, the pillars.

1196
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:58,370
I'm gonna go find a cutscene compilation that shows where all the numbers are.

1197
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,770
I don't know.

1198
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:11,930
Let's just go into it.

1199
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,510
Let's just see what we got first.

1200
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:15,330
What's going on and then we'll figure it out.

1201
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:23,590
I like to see what's going on first before we purchase anything.

1202
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,470
Cashew, thanks for the raid.

1203
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,310
Thank you.

1204
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,330
We came from here, so let's go this way.

1205
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:44,170
Nice.

1206
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,230
No Roar was hidden from me.

1207
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,690
Oh gosh.

1208
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,350
I think I tried to get this one before.

1209
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,190
Nice.

1210
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,130
OK.

1211
01:04:58,610 --> 01:04:59,710
Thanks for the gift.

1212
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,030
What is this?

1213
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,350
What is this?

1214
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,070
What am I fighting?

1215
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,250
Oh god.

1216
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:15,930
Wait, is this that one room that they don't stop coming until...

1217
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:17,190
Oh my god.

1218
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:24,760
Why would I need to go back there?

1219
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,700
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

1220
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,680
They don't stop coming.

1221
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:34,540
Yeah, I didn't do that room because...

1222
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,460
Maybe it would be easier now with all the new weapons we got.

1223
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,320
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1224
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,420
Thank you.

1225
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,000
Everything is twisting and turning.

1226
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,020
Oh no.

1227
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,400
No, please.

1228
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,520
I already have bad depth perception.

1229
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,480
Don't do this to me.

1230
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:03,820
Oh my goodness.

1231
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,680
Rorb farm.

1232
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:14,180
What are the Rorbs?

1233
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,860
Like what are they made of?

1234
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,500
And the Blorbs.

1235
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,880
Like why do they have human faces?

1236
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:28,880
Seven?

1237
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,440
Anyway, I moved forward.

1238
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:33,580
Forward.

1239
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,900
We went real.

1240
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,900
This is where Air Raid on Nevin really shines.

1241
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,830
Dang it.

1242
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,930
But we do have an Air Raid.

1243
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:01,230
I guess I went the harder direction.

1244
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:03,810
OK.

1245
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:04,650
Nice, nice, nice.

1246
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,110
Alright.

1247
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:08,010
I cannot see.

1248
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:09,630
What is this door?

1249
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,730
First of all...

1250
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,830
We have our first door.

1251
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,510
Oh god.

1252
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,120
Stop parrying me!

1253
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,840
Stop parrying me!

1254
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520
I like this thing a lot though, honestly.

1255
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:53,900
I feel like it works pretty well to also like make it so that...

1256
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,380
Oh my god.

1257
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,220
So that if something is also trying to hit me...

1258
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,840
It's harder to parry though.

1259
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,860
But it's like there's things behind me and stuff trying to get me too.

1260
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,100
I can at least... Oh my goodness.

1261
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:16,660
OK.

1262
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,040
Maybe I give up.

1263
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,660
Maybe I lied.

1264
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,280
No, that's not what I meant to do.

1265
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,100
What is this?

1266
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,300
Holy cow!

1267
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,120
Did that hit me too?

1268
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,100
There's splash damage?

1269
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,590
Oh there is no... Oh, he just hit me?

1270
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:54,870
OK.

1271
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,170
That'd be so funny.

1272
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,730
It'd be so funny if there is.

1273
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,210
I'm turning it down.

1274
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,250
Oh my gosh, it's so loud.

1275
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,990
I feel like I'm screaming at you guys.

1276
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,240
Which way did I come from?

1277
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,660
That door.

1278
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,290
Oh, we're here!

1279
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,330
What boss was in this room?

1280
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:19,070
I don't remember.

1281
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:21,250
Wait, no, this is where I got Agni and Rudra.

1282
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:24,350
Yeah, that's who was in there.

1283
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,710
Oh, how fitting that we...

1284
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:30,010
That we defeated them then with it.

1285
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,910
Kalina Ando's crazy damage, doesn't it?

1286
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:37,350
Are you guys 100% sure there's no splash damage?

1287
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:39,430
100%?

1288
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:40,430
You're not lying to me?

1289
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:41,250
What's this?

1290
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:45,190
Lord Fragments.

1291
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,330
Wow, lucky!

1292
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:48,870
Let's go.

1293
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,470
No splash.

1294
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:51,950
OK.

1295
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:53,390
Thank you.

1296
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:55,510
No joke.

1297
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,390
You're joking?

1298
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:59,270
You're joshing me?

1299
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:01,710
Is that all that's here?

1300
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,070
You know what?

1301
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,190
It's kind of worth it.

1302
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,030
Go through the fight for the blorb.

1303
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,730
There's really nothing here?

1304
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,990
No, there has to be.

1305
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,250
Right?

1306
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:24,310
No help.

1307
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:24,650
OK.

1308
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:25,990
So I'm missing something.

1309
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,790
You guys are saying I'm missing something.

1310
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:29,990
OK.

1311
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,430
I love this game a lot.

1312
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,070
This section is not one of the reasons.

1313
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,530
Good luck platforming, Minto.

1314
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:36,770
Thank you.

1315
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:39,930
Oh, really?

1316
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:41,450
Up you go.

1317
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:41,790
OK.

1318
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:45,330
Lucky.

1319
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,550
Thanks for letting me not waste my time, guys.

1320
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,790
I do appreciate that, actually.

1321
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:55,450
I'm not being sarcastic in the slightest.

1322
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:56,650
Oh no!

1323
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:58,750
Eirik.

1324
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:01,890
Eirik.

1325
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:02,790
OK.

1326
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,230
Don't do that.

1327
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,350
Don't do that, please.

1328
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:14,790
Shoot.

1329
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,250
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

1330
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,320
It's alright.

1331
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,100
We can get there.

1332
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,020
Pretty easily, I'd say.

1333
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,160
OK, nice.

1334
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,500
Oh, what?

1335
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,480
I jumped out.

1336
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,920
I did.

1337
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,720
Maybe something was blocking me and I didn't see it.

1338
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,000
I did jump.

1339
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,560
Wait a second.

1340
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,360
Oh, nevermind.

1341
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,870
No, nothing was blocking me.

1342
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,690
I'm just an idiot, I suppose.

1343
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,130
Oh, OK.

1344
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:03,070
I'm assessing my next move.

1345
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,510
I don't want to go on top of those.

1346
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:10,290
Maybe this one that's going in a little circle right here.

1347
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,710
Don't push me off, please!

1348
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:12,650
Don't push me off!

1349
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:15,310
You!

1350
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:16,050
I want...

1351
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:18,690
OK, that's not...

1352
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:21,210
I am...

1353
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,630
Eirik, thank you for the superchat.

1354
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:30,230
Suffering.

1355
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,690
OK, we went on to...

1356
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,990
That ride right there.

1357
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:39,630
I can't see!

1358
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,250
Jump for the beef.

1359
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,670
I am, I am.

1360
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:48,690
Oh, OK.

1361
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,150
This guy only goes up and down.

1362
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:57,570
Oh, OK.

1363
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,590
I'm just going back here then.

1364
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,010
I'm not going to waste my time.

1365
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,470
This one.

1366
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:06,030
This one, like, dancing around.

1367
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:06,570
Right here.

1368
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:07,190
This one!

1369
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:08,610
This is the one I want.

1370
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:09,050
Oh gosh.

1371
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,190
Please, please.

1372
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:11,750
Please!

1373
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:13,430
OK, OK.

1374
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,910
Come by with this tower.

1375
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:17,370
Made me cry as a kid.

1376
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:18,170
No way!

1377
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:20,850
So close.

1378
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:21,470
OK.

1379
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:22,910
We are close.

1380
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:23,390
We are close.

1381
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:25,690
And...

1382
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:26,510
Run!

1383
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:35,620
OK, I'm dancing in the air.

1384
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,540
I don't...Where do I go from here?

1385
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,240
Oh my god.

1386
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,100
I'm gonna...

1387
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:49,940
Guys, I think...

1388
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,480
I made a mistake.

1389
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,820
I can't see!

1390
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,700
I can't see!

1391
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,400
What's going on?

1392
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,220
No!

1393
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,440
Oh no, please!

1394
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,720
Dante use your arms for once!

1395
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,000
Dancing, platforming, my not beloved.

1396
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:32,040
Luckily, to get to where we were at is not very difficult.

1397
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,220
Like so?

1398
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,040
Maybe I try...nevermind.

1399
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,120
You know what?

1400
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,260
Let's try a different way, right?

1401
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,240
No!

1402
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,800
Do I not see the stairs?

1403
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,940
I don't see anything, honestly.

1404
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,200
The camera is really bugging me out.

1405
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,160
OK.

1406
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,260
I think there is one that descends all the way down here.

1407
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:29,840
Yeah, this one.

1408
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,320
OK.

1409
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,140
And then it goes up.

1410
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,060
And it goes higher.

1411
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,740
And we can go here.

1412
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,540
People are saying these stairs, right?

1413
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,640
OK, jump.

1414
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,180
No!

1415
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:45,580
No!

1416
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,320
How are you supposed to...

1417
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:51,280
How are you supposed to get out of that when it blocks you out?

1418
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,820
Truths welcome to...Mabusha, thank you!

1419
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,840
Oh, from the right side.

1420
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,280
OK.

1421
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,500
VOD watchers...

1422
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,460
VOD watchers, skip...

1423
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:21,580
Another 45 minutes.

1424
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,420
Oh, Truths!

1425
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,980
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 20 gifted!

1426
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,800
What the heck!

1427
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,900
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.

1428
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,140
Alright, here we go.

1429
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,500
Skip to February.

1430
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,720
OK, so we go over...

1431
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,380
To here.

1432
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,060
And then I jump onto it from here.

1433
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,140
Please...No!

1434
01:16:59,280 --> 01:16:59,440
No!

1435
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,440
We made it!

1436
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,300
OK, OK, OK.

1437
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,640
Don't skip!

1438
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:13,820
Don't...

1439
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,820
Don't skip 40 minutes!

1440
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:17,800
You'll miss it!

1441
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,580
Don't skip!

1442
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,400
You'll miss it!

1443
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,400
Is this the Jonkler guy again?

1444
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,720
Too late, I skipped.

1445
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,200
No!

1446
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,020
Can I get around him?

1447
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,240
See ya!

1448
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,980
He's like, you really wanna fight me, don't you?

1449
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,800
What are we fighting here?

1450
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,980
Oh, it's these guys.

1451
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,160
OK, actually...

1452
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,240
Oh my god, I can't see when you...

1453
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,020
Come on!

1454
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:01,740
Nice!

1455
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

1456
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,080
You know what it was worth?

1457
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,620
Because we were able to get one guy.

1458
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:12,640
Nice!

1459
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:13,780
That was good.

1460
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,680
We got really lucky with that.

1461
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:22,370
Hey!

1462
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,630
Oh, it's this room!

1463
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:31,350
You start as a baby...

1464
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:33,930
And then you...Oh shoot.

1465
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,670
Wait, there's only two ways we can go.

1466
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:40,050
Never skip Minto Day or...Oh!

1467
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:41,550
Just kidding!

1468
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,070
There's only one way I can go!

1469
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:45,810
Just kidding!

1470
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:45,930
Just kidding!

1471
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,330
Trial of skill.

1472
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,270
Oh, it's this one again.

1473
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:52,770
That's right.

1474
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,830
What's on the other side?

1475
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:00,170
What am I...

1476
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,860
We have air hike.

1477
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:05,120
OK.

1478
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,700
Alright, run!

1479
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,610
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch!

1480
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:15,410
Oh, I made it?

1481
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:17,790
Oh, I made it?

1482
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,630
Nice!

1483
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,070
We made...Oh gosh!

1484
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:37,230
We made it?

1485
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,110
Alright, let's go.

1486
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,270
Upwards.

1487
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,690
Pitch black void.

1488
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,270
They keep calling it that.

1489
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:58,410
I literally can see everything.

1490
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,650
Over name this sucks.

1491
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,730
More hidden robes for me.

1492
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,370
Every minute skipped is when you can't stare at me.

1493
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:16,830
Why would you want that?

1494
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:18,570
Why are you doing that, you freak?

1495
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:20,870
OK.

1496
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:22,490
I think that's all of them.

1497
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,600
OK, 38.

1498
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,560
I was like, wait a second, I only have 3000?

1499
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:41,680
Hello?

1500
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,440
Oh no!

1501
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,320
I'm not running.

1502
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,710
I'm shooting whatever.

1503
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,430
I can't see anything.

1504
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,810
I'm assuming this is working.

1505
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,180
Cerberus, yeah, because they are icy.

1506
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:42,590
Yeah, take that.

1507
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:48,360
Dang, these guys are beefy.

1508
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,820
Beef, beef, beef.

1509
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,860
Oh, they are both down.

1510
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,620
What am I doing?

1511
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,720
Oh, Redman!

1512
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,120
OK, nice.

1513
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:26,790
Easy.

1514
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:26,890
Easy.

1515
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,710
What's your devil trigger look like?

1516
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:32,850
Or is it a ghost trigger?

1517
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:34,570
Maybe a demon trigger.

1518
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,670
Maybe one day you'll see it, I don't know.

1519
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:40,630
GT, Dragon Ball.

1520
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:45,630
Moonlight Mile.

1521
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:58,690
This is where we fought who?

1522
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:00,450
OK, what should I buy?

1523
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,690
Revolver level 2.

1524
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,570
Jetstream, I have so many things I could buy.

1525
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:16,690
I don't really use Nevin.

1526
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,290
I'm sorry, I really don't use Nevin.

1527
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:25,330
We also have more for Beowulf.

1528
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:34,910
No...

1529
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:35,930
I know, right?

1530
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:37,410
I use Revolver a lot.

1531
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:40,210
So I was like, Revolver 2 would be good.

1532
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,720
Revolver 2 is good.

1533
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,980
I could buy...

1534
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,260
Like, two things, honestly.

1535
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,200
Maybe straight level 2.

1536
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:00,300
Level 2.

1537
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,200
Maybe straight level 2 and then...

1538
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,760
Is Beast Uppercut good?

1539
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,180
What was the...

1540
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:11,840
How do I use it?

1541
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:13,640
R, L, Back, X.

1542
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:13,940
OK.

1543
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,840
So it's basically my...

1544
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,720
The one for Rebellion that I love.

1545
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,140
Put your hand up!

1546
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,580
It's really good?

1547
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,980
I love seeing, it's meh.

1548
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,480
And it's really good.

1549
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:30,780
Right next to each other.

1550
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,620
I don't think you would use it a lot.

1551
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,200
Possibly.

1552
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,860
Let's do straight level 2.

1553
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,640
Oh, that's not what I meant.

1554
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:43,420
Sorry.

1555
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,100
Let's do straight level 2.

1556
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,140
And let's do Cerberus level 2 as well.

1557
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,380
I think... Wait.

1558
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,300
That should be good for now.

1559
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,120
I want to not spend all my money.

1560
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:02,600
I don't want to spend all my money right now.

1561
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:11,670
Virgil, you here?

1562
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:12,850
What is that?

1563
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:18,410
What is that?

1564
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:25,430
Should I skip you?

1565
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:32,530
Raymack, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1566
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:33,750
Thank you!

1567
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:36,790
Oh, did we get another raid?

1568
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,710
Hello!

1569
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:39,910
Thanks for the raid!

1570
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,270
Wait, I didn't see who raided, but thank you!

1571
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:44,830
Hello, hello.

1572
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:49,170
OK, I'm going through.

1573
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,910
Oh,

1574
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:55,740
Arisu.

1575
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:56,800
Welcome!

1576
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,420
Thank you.

1577
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,180
My shadow!

1578
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:14,660
Oh my God, this really is Kingdom Hearts.

1579
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,620
I don't know about that.

1580
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,080
You don't need your shadow?

1581
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,280
I don't think that's how that works, Dante.

1582
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:34,920
You just get one.

1583
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,780
You tell him.

1584
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,000
Oh my God.

1585
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,820
OK, that was good.

1586
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,060
OK, great.

1587
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,660
Do I need to get him into the light, I think.

1588
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:55,560
Oh my gosh.

1589
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,460
Where is the light?

1590
01:26:58,820 --> 01:26:58,820
OK.

1591
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,100
Why are your tricks so much faster than mine?

1592
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:06,900
Oh my God.

1593
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:10,200
Where is the light?

1594
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:18,150
Oh, here we go.

1595
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,950
I see, I see, I see.

1596
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:25,370
Yeah!

1597
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:27,470
Oh, now you're just a little baby wimp!

1598
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,960
Baby wimp, baby wimp.

1599
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,960
Oh, he's destroying me.

1600
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,100
Come and get me.

1601
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,500
Where are you anyway?

1602
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,500
Oh, shoot.

1603
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,420
Oh, there's another one.

1604
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:10,880
Oh, you're just so small!

1605
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,700
You are such a tiny man!

1606
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,920
Oh, that's not good.

1607
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,060
I didn't mean it.

1608
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,140
Oh no!

1609
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:29,830
Yeah, when he comes and gets me, I can do this.

1610
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:35,830
Dang it, I was too slow.

1611
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:37,770
Come and get me.

1612
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:40,730
You taught me, I taught you.

1613
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:46,220
Oh!

1614
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:46,720
Oh,

1615
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,500
he says the same things as me!

1616
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,340
That's so funny.

1617
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:04,500
No!

1618
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,580
Oh, dang it.

1619
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:08,420
I was too early.

1620
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:10,800
Come on, wimp.

1621
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,200
Oh my God.

1622
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:14,860
Oh, shoot.

1623
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,980
It's not good, it's not good.

1624
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:18,800
Yeah.

1625
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:21,820
Oh, shoot.

1626
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,260
Come on, wimp.

1627
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:25,500
No!

1628
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,480
I had that, I had that.

1629
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:31,660
Oh, I had that, I had that, I had that.

1630
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,700
Which one are you going aiming for?

1631
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:45,460
Stop!

1632
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,200
You're ruining my hard work.

1633
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:49,840
Come on.

1634
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,280
Maybe he'll come towards me now.

1635
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:56,860
Dang it.

1636
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,760
I can't time it right.

1637
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,300
He keeps aiming for the same one.

1638
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,480
Oh, shut up.

1639
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:30,070
Same one again?

1640
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:33,030
Oh my God.

1641
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,790
Oh my God, that scared me.

1642
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:41,350
Oh my God, it scared me so bad.

1643
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:44,390
Oh, I couldn't even move.

1644
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,370
Holy jump scare.

1645
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:50,270
I don't think... Let's try a different weapon maybe.

1646
01:30:58,340 --> 01:30:59,040
Sheesh.

1647
01:30:59,380 --> 01:30:59,620
OK.

1648
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:12,210
It's like the one thing that can ruin a game is audio balancing.

1649
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:18,110
Beowulf might be best for the opening lights in one hit.

1650
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:29,850
And I do have air hype with that, which... Oh my God, go away!

1651
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,400
OK, so I can't do anything to him while he's...

1652
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,880
This is so messed up!

1653
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,360
What the hell?

1654
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,020
I didn't even do anything.

1655
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:33,430
Stupid!

1656
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,200
Can you not go after... OK.

1657
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:48,810
Which one did you go after?

1658
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,350
Oh God, oh God, oh God, we're not gonna make it!

1659
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,420
You son of a bitch.

1660
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,760
Even still...

1661
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,120
I'm not gonna use that anymore.

1662
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:22,400
There we go.

1663
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,380
Maybe, but he was kind of further away.

1664
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,320
The stinger and that one hit, it works!

1665
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,280
The stinger!

1666
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:35,080
Hit!

1667
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,180
Yeah, it's good.

1668
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,580
OK, OK, OK, OK.

1669
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,300
Oh, that was good, that was good.

1670
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:53,280
That was good damage.

1671
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:00,430
Wow, shoot!

1672
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,160
Shoot, oh shoot.

1673
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:09,860
No!

1674
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:25,780
OK, OK.

1675
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,560
Oh, we got him, nice.

1676
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:42,380
OK.

1677
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,120
Oh my God, I did not expect him to come after me again.

1678
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,120
No!

1679
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,060
Come and get me!

1680
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,140
Come and get me!

1681
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,000
Which one?

1682
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,500
Come and get me!

1683
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,240
Why did you do that?

1684
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,220
It was already done!

1685
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:11,950
We're so close.

1686
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:19,690
Dang it, I didn't time that one well.

1687
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:21,330
My bean.

1688
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,030
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1689
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:32,410
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1690
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:33,030
Don't taunt him.

1691
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:37,790
Oh my God, don't taunt him.

1692
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:38,650
He's serious.

1693
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,750
He's serious.

1694
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:43,330
Oh shoot.

1695
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:51,840
Uh...

1696
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:57,870
OK, maybe I can...

1697
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:00,730
Nice shoot.

1698
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:03,890
Oh, almost there.

1699
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:05,250
Almost there.

1700
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,220
Come on, ween.

1701
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:18,850
No, no, that's not what I meant to do.

1702
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:20,190
No, no, no, no.

1703
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:26,390
Oh, come on, come on, Dante, one more, one more, one more hit.

1704
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,310
Stop taunting.

1705
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,290
Dante, Dante, please.

1706
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:30,230
Dante, you're throwing.

1707
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:35,490
OK, here we go.

1708
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:39,670
No, so close.

1709
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:41,330
Where is it?

1710
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:46,610
Oh my God.

1711
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:47,550
Come on.

1712
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:48,590
There it is.

1713
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:49,410
Please.

1714
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:53,990
Oh my God.

1715
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:56,330
I didn't fumble.

1716
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:57,830
It was Dante.

1717
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:01,970
I'm targeted on the right things.

1718
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,120
Kingdom Hearts.

1719
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:19,800
Oh yeah, my mirror image.

1720
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,480
You can't trust literally anyone in the series.

1721
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:26,520
You even have to fight yourself.

1722
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,340
What the hell?

1723
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,720
Doppelganger?

1724
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:35,380
Special power used by the Doppelganger enemy.

1725
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,720
This style gives you more freedom in battle to try out different tactics and combos.

1726
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:45,220
Change styles to Doppelganger by quickly pressing the left button twice.

1727
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,540
Oh, I think I did it.

1728
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,520
I get a single roar before that.

1729
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,180
Oh, my health.

1730
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:24,910
If you had a friend while you used Doppelganger, a second joystick can press start and control the shadow.

1731
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:30,090
Please.

1732
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:33,030
Nice.

1733
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:35,290
Save.

1734
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:38,250
Nice.

1735
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:41,870
Alright, alright, alright.

1736
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:44,890
That leaves three more missions.

1737
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:50,370
What one are we on?

1738
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:51,070
18?

1739
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:51,830
18.

1740
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:57,470
Shall we?

1741
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:04,680
Why did they word it as if you had a friend?

1742
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,780
They are saying, if you had a friend.

1743
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:12,900
I missed it again.

1744
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:13,440
Dang it.

1745
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,580
I was too busy watching tiny Dante fly into the sky.

1746
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,600
Break the seal and battle into the depths.

1747
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,670
Fill your dark soul with light.

1748
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:36,410
Oh,

1749
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:41,110
my gosh.

1750
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:44,630
Lord of the Rings Eye of Sauron is staring at us.

1751
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:48,150
Oh, thank you.

1752
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:49,590
Oh, thank you.

1753
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:50,950
Thank you.

1754
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:52,190
Gosh, I feel like royalty.

1755
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:53,850
Oh, my God.

1756
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:56,110
You guys all know who I am.

1757
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,190
Thank you.

1758
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:03,950
I don't know how to... Oh, my God.

1759
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,390
No.

1760
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:05,230
No.

1761
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,910
I don't think that's how you play.

1762
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:16,410
I don't think that's how you play the game.

1763
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:22,990
Ok, we'll get them to come towards... Oh, that's not what I meant.

1764
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:24,670
I totally thought...

1765
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:29,610
Run away.

1766
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:34,770
Shoot them with my really big gun.

1767
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,970
Oh, shoot.

1768
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:41,990
Shoot.

1769
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:47,790
Just do one at a time.

1770
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,550
Get the small babies out of the way first.

1771
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:51,970
Get the small babies out of the way first.

1772
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:54,210
Get the small babies out of the way.

1773
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:56,890
Jump.

1774
01:40:57,030 --> 01:40:57,230
Jump.

1775
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:57,370
Jump.

1776
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:00,650
Get the small babies out of the way.

1777
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:02,350
Small babies out of the way.

1778
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:05,730
The big babies are coming in.

1779
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,670
The big babies are coming in.

1780
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:08,150
Wait.

1781
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:11,530
Oh, I can only attack the ones that are light.

1782
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:12,510
Ok.

1783
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:13,690
Interesting.

1784
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:15,310
So now I can attack him.

1785
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:17,990
Oh, ok.

1786
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,320
I can't attack you anymore.

1787
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:25,680
But maybe in a second.

1788
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,980
Maybe you'll... Undo?

1789
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:28,560
No?

1790
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,360
Oh, God.

1791
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,220
Oh, the king.

1792
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,140
Oh, the king.

1793
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:37,880
Oh, shoot.

1794
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:42,290
Oh, my God.

1795
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:44,630
I can't see when you guys walk away like that.

1796
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,620
Oh, my God.

1797
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:52,060
What's happening?

1798
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:55,700
The horse.

1799
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:57,580
The horse.

1800
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,260
There we go.

1801
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,380
Take him out.

1802
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,180
Oh, my God.

1803
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:02,800
Is that the queen?

1804
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:08,960
Oh, my God.

1805
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,000
Oh, the king is back.

1806
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,160
Oh, the king is back.

1807
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,080
Oh, my God.

1808
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:14,860
Ok.

1809
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:17,280
I don't think it pays to attack him.

1810
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:23,630
Oh, gosh.

1811
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,830
Who can I attack right now?

1812
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:26,370
You.

1813
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,620
Oh, what's going on?

1814
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,720
What is happening?

1815
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:46,180
Oh, my God.

1816
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,740
Everything is craziness.

1817
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,340
Oh, my God.

1818
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:53,720
Only the queen is active at the moment.

1819
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:55,340
Oh, God.

1820
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:55,940
Oh, my God.

1821
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:59,920
What the... I'm literally... Oh, God.

1822
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:00,160
Ok.

1823
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:02,500
Stop.

1824
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:05,740
Stop.

1825
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,320
Oh, my God.

1826
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:09,620
Run, run, Dante.

1827
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,960
I think I'm gonna change to punching them.

1828
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:13,760
Oh, my gosh.

1829
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,020
Ok.

1830
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:14,560
I forgot.

1831
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:16,220
Sometimes I can punch you.

1832
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,900
Sometimes I can't punch you.

1833
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:23,880
Punch.

1834
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,500
Run, Dante.

1835
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:26,120
Oh, my God.

1836
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:26,700
I'm about to die.

1837
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,060
Run, run, run.

1838
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,080
Ok, we got that guy out of the way.

1839
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:37,700
I'm gonna die though for real.

1840
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:38,800
I'm gonna die.

1841
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:39,520
I'm gonna tank it.

1842
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,280
I'm gonna...

1843
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,700
Oh, thank God.

1844
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,620
Oh, my goodness.

1845
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,060
Wait, who is healing them?

1846
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,520
You son of a bitch.

1847
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,820
No way.

1848
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:49,800
Run.

1849
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,500
Oh, gosh.

1850
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:54,060
This is so much.

1851
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:55,640
There is just too much happening.

1852
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,340
I can't concentrate.

1853
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:02,260
There is so much happening.

1854
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,880
Oh, my goodness.

1855
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:06,580
Oh, my goodness.

1856
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,340
I didn't even see that one happening.

1857
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:12,820
Oh, my God.

1858
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,060
As soon as I...

1859
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:30,710
Just get rid of you.

1860
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:31,490
Get rid of you.

1861
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:46,910
They are laughing and I'm crying.

1862
01:44:58,270 --> 01:44:59,050
Thank goodness.

1863
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:04,930
Is this one of the healing ones?

1864
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:06,110
Ok.

1865
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:06,790
Oh, my gosh.

1866
01:45:06,910 --> 01:45:07,490
Out of the way.

1867
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,350
Who is laughing at me anyway?

1868
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:13,290
So mean.

1869
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:17,350
Oh, gosh.

1870
01:45:18,690 --> 01:45:20,930
Oh, I thought you were...

1871
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:24,930
Ok, besides the king...

1872
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:28,450
He is going to sacrifice himself.

1873
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:31,250
Oh, my goodness.

1874
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:32,350
This is insanity.

1875
01:45:33,990 --> 01:45:34,450
Ok.

1876
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:42,100
This is not how you play chess.

1877
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,640
I don't think this is how you play chess.

1878
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,060
Oh, this guy is still around.

1879
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,280
Hey there, buddy.

1880
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:02,520
Get my little hidden.

1881
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:14,730
I got to get rid of this one of these things at least.

1882
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:15,390
Oh, thank goodness.

1883
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:20,910
No, I tried to jump away.

1884
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:24,910
Oh, shoot.

1885
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,630
Oh, my God.

1886
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,220
Oh, good.

1887
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:39,640
I'm going to have to redo all of this again and I think I'm going to lose my...

1888
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,180
Do I have any heals?

1889
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,220
I don't want to do this again.

1890
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:44,740
I do have a heal.

1891
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,060
I don't want to do this again.

1892
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:54,100
I hate chess.

1893
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:57,000
I'll never play it.

1894
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,820
I can't... I don't...

1895
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:05,900
Maybe I could have saved it for a more serious...

1896
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,300
I feel like this is a pretty serious situation.

1897
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:17,460
To

1898
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:22,890
defend yourself!

1899
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:24,090
Oh, my God.

1900
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:25,830
I can't see.

1901
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:26,930
What just happened there?

1902
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:33,320
I'm trying to hit you.

1903
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:35,900
Oh, I forgot I'm a trickster.

1904
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:46,250
Oh, my God.

1905
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:47,310
Trickster level 2!

1906
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:52,010
Hold L in any direction and press A while in mid-air.

1907
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:57,990
Perform the dash maneuver two times in rapid succes...

1908
01:47:58,690 --> 01:47:59,710
Oh, my God.

1909
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:01,410
Oh, my God.

1910
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:02,390
Big news!

1911
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:03,230
Big news!

1912
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,230
That was so good!

1913
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,050
Oh, my God!

1914
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:13,950
Oh, my God!

1915
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:20,730
Demon chess is like chess.

1916
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:24,390
Pawns transform if you let them cross the board.

1917
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:26,170
Towers change place...

1918
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:27,470
Oh, my God.

1919
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:27,810
Wait.

1920
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,610
Oh, my God.

1921
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,440
I'm just gonna run.

1922
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:39,520
I'm just gonna leave.

1923
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:40,260
Goodbye!

1924
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:41,180
Sayonara!

1925
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,100
Goodbye!

1926
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,060
Goodbye!

1927
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:44,460
Goodbye!

1928
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:45,820
Oh, my God.

1929
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:46,260
They are fast.

1930
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:47,020
They are fast.

1931
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:47,560
Goodbye!

1932
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:48,640
Goodbye!

1933
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:48,920
Goodbye!

1934
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:50,140
Goodbye!

1935
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:50,700
Goodbye!

1936
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:51,560
Goodbye!

1937
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:51,720
Goodbye!

1938
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,460
Grorb.

1939
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,180
Grorb, I'm in desperate need.

1940
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:05,240
Delicious.

1941
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,520
Nutritious.

1942
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,540
What the?

1943
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:12,760
Oh, this is a world?

1944
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:14,940
These are doors?

1945
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:16,400
No.

1946
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:19,020
Oh, no.

1947
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:22,580
This guy again?

1948
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:24,560
Oh, no.

1949
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,180
I don't remember how I killed him before.

1950
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:33,280
I think I jumped up on the spider's back.

1951
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,180
I mean the... What's his name?

1952
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,020
Oh, wait.

1953
01:49:53,790 --> 01:49:54,470
That was great.

1954
01:49:55,290 --> 01:49:55,890
Good job.

1955
01:49:57,490 --> 01:49:58,510
Good job, Watashi.

1956
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:25,610
There was an attempt.

1957
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:26,450
Absolutely.

1958
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:31,170
Did I get on him?

1959
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:31,350
Yeah!

1960
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:32,870
I got on him.

1961
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:33,570
I got on him.

1962
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:33,730
Alright.

1963
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:34,990
Jump, jump, jumpy!

1964
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,320
Just Cerberus for this one?

1965
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:44,140
But then I don't have my airhike.

1966
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:47,660
Okay, I'll try it.

1967
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:49,900
He's coming up top.

1968
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:50,740
I knew it.

1969
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,420
Oh, gosh!

1970
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:55,620
The parry, the parry, the parry!

1971
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,960
Oh, we're just eating it.

1972
01:50:59,140 --> 01:50:59,780
Hold on.

1973
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:01,100
Maybe this one will be better.

1974
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:04,460
Maybe this one will be better for parry.

1975
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:16,980
Yeah,

1976
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:26,440
but only dashing the air is horizontal, not upwards.

1977
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:29,660
Okay, here it comes, here it comes.

1978
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:34,880
Oh, I'm eating, I'm eating it, I'm eating it.

1979
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,020
How

1980
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,560
I did this before?

1981
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:59,200
Where is the purple coming from?

1982
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:00,560
Oh, that's not purple.

1983
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:01,800
Okay.

1984
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:03,760
Holy moly.

1985
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:07,800
Did I use Cerberus before?

1986
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:14,000
Hold on, I'm waiting for him to...

1987
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,660
We already got him halfway there.

1988
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,580
Good thing we upgraded.

1989
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:36,130
Oh my god, oh my god.

1990
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:41,890
It's because I decide too late what I want to do.

1991
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:45,070
Okay, purple.

1992
01:52:45,450 --> 01:52:46,250
Not purple.

1993
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:47,310
No purple?

1994
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:48,370
That's okay.

1995
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,510
Oh, dang it.

1996
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,980
He's doing the spin around.

1997
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:08,160
He's going for the full tour.

1998
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,300
I missed.

1999
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:10,340
I missed.

2000
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:16,140
Okay, come on buddy.

2001
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,540
Come on back.

2002
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:19,180
Is it purple time?

2003
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,240
No, it's blue time.

2004
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,500
Oh, that's right.

2005
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:25,700
These things still hurt me.

2006
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:38,280
Oh.

2007
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:38,880
Oh.

2008
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:54,880
So close.

2009
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:56,180
Come on.

2010
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:00,460
Oh, purple!

2011
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,660
Let's go.

2012
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,160
Let's go.

2013
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,820
I was going to say, he doesn't give me anything.

2014
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,360
He gives me some orbs.

2015
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,120
I'll take it.

2016
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,460
Alright.

2017
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,820
Oh, oh, oh no!

2018
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,540
They're going to disappear, aren't they?

2019
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,560
Oh, I got him.

2020
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,020
Alright.

2021
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:42,390
Shiny.

2022
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:43,010
Ah!

2023
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:45,690
It does light up.

2024
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:47,450
Thank you.

2025
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:54,650
Later, Minto goes to a chess tournament and ends up defeating the game pieces and calls of the day, confusing the players.

2026
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:59,790
Who's that guy that like had the controversy?

2027
01:55:00,070 --> 01:55:02,290
I can't remember what the controversy was either.

2028
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:04,970
It was like...

2029
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:07,730
They thought he had something up his butt.

2030
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:13,290
And that it was like vibrating and giving him moves.

2031
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:23,130
I forgot about that until this very moment.

2032
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:25,510
Now I'm really upset that I remembered it.

2033
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,540
Are all of these bosses?

2034
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,080
And then also...

2035
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:39,180
Do I have to do every single one of them?

2036
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,120
Yes!

2037
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:47,280
Alright, let's go to pink.

2038
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:50,900
Oh, ma'am.

2039
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,060
How did I defeat you before?

2040
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,120
Oh my gosh.

2041
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,640
I don't remember.

2042
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,680
I think I just did this.

2043
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:05,500
I just like got my DT up by shooting her.

2044
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:09,440
This is a test of my memory.

2045
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:11,120
Oh!

2046
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:11,400
Oh!

2047
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:12,240
Oh my god.

2048
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:12,740
Oh my god.

2049
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:18,300
We're getting our DT up.

2050
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:20,060
How did I activate... Oh gosh.

2051
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,800
I think she went in for the hug and I went in for the kill.

2052
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,660
lol

2053
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:28,080
Oh my gosh.

2054
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:29,440
I love having double dash now.

2055
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,140
Oh yeah!

2056
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:32,920
Feels good.

2057
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,740
And then... Oh!

2058
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:37,820
Oh my god.

2059
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:39,820
Ah!

2060
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,560
Okay.

2061
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:47,800
Alright.

2062
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:49,960
I think I go in for the hug now.

2063
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,160
That's like the easiest one to avoid too.

2064
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:56,860
I'm so mad.

2065
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:00,860
Uh...

2066
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:01,720
Mito, you're not hitting.

2067
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,040
I know!

2068
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:03,180
I said I'm building up DT.

2069
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:06,000
I'm trying to remember how to defeat her.

2070
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,260
You guys!

2071
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:09,680
You guys, seriously?

2072
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,720
You guys, come on.

2073
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,420
I said, okay, I shoot her to build up DT.

2074
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:16,600
That's literally what I said.

2075
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:20,020
And then you're all in chat being like...

2076
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:23,280
You guys are in chat being like...

2077
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,020
Oh!

2078
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:26,280
You're not hitting her.

2079
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,280
Yeah, I know.

2080
01:57:43,410 --> 01:57:44,970
The gun is short range?

2081
01:57:47,490 --> 01:57:49,410
That's so weird because it's a rocket launcher.

2082
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:54,650
No hit equals no DT.

2083
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:57,770
I know that sometimes I'm not always hitting, but...

2084
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,000
Yeah, it's dumb.

2085
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:03,640
lol

2086
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,020
Just how it works.

2087
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:11,980
Okay, well, I didn't know that it was a short range weapon, so...

2088
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:14,580
You know, I guess that's my fault for not reading.

2089
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:17,940
I guess it's always my fault.

2090
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:19,620
It's always my fault.

2091
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:22,020
I just won't use it.

2092
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,180
And I am building DT.

2093
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:26,460
You can literally see it building.

2094
01:58:41,570 --> 01:58:42,870
I'm gonna go get some more water.

2095
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:43,550
I'll be right back.

2096
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:41,200
Okie dokie.

2097
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:41,880
Alright.

2098
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:54,340
I don't remember how to beat her.

2099
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,720
I'll figure it out eventually.

2100
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:02,500
Or I'll just run in circles and make you guys even more angry.

2101
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,280
lol

2102
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,380
Why didn't she go in for the hug?

2103
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:16,480
Sugar.

2104
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:18,000
Oh, here she comes.

2105
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:21,520
Oh, nevermind.

2106
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:29,260
Oh, number.

2107
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:29,420
Number.

2108
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:39,340
What did I do to trigger her?

2109
02:00:52,770 --> 02:00:55,130
Is it gonna go far away?

2110
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:07,670
Sugar.

2111
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:20,540
Can't remember.

2112
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,140
Oh, here we go.

2113
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:22,100
I just have to hit her a bunch.

2114
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:37,770
When did she do the hug though?

2115
02:01:38,030 --> 02:01:38,550
I don't know.

2116
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:05,280
Ok, I'm just gonna go for her.

2117
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,300
Come here lady.

2118
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:09,960
Come here pretty lady.

2119
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:10,800
Oopsie.

2120
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:11,220
Oopsie.

2121
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:11,640
Oopsie.

2122
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:12,080
Oopsie.

2123
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:12,580
Oopsie.

2124
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:15,320
I'm getting greedy.

2125
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,580
Getting greedy.

2126
02:02:26,190 --> 02:02:27,910
If I die, I die though.

2127
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:28,630
Whatever.

2128
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,120
Oh, madam?

2129
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:38,940
Wait, where's the other stage?

2130
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:41,560
Did it disappear?

2131
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:43,120
Oh my god.

2132
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:49,600
Ok, maybe she starts doing the hug now.

2133
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:50,160
I don't remember.

2134
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:55,980
Oh my god.

2135
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,880
Oh my god lady.

2136
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,320
Where's the other stage?

2137
02:02:58,800 --> 02:02:59,440
Is there not one?

2138
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:01,040
Oh, it's right there.

2139
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:02,160
I guess I was against the wall.

2140
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:04,240
Ah, stupid VTuber.

2141
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:05,300
She's so dumb.

2142
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,040
She doesn't even know where things are.

2143
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,250
Gummy VTuber.

2144
02:03:20,130 --> 02:03:21,130
She doesn't know anything.

2145
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:36,150
Oh my god.

2146
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:36,650
Oh my god.

2147
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:37,430
Oh my god.

2148
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:38,670
When are you gonna hug me?

2149
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:39,930
Please.

2150
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:41,670
I've been a good boy.

2151
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:43,370
Please ma'am.

2152
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:44,490
I need a hug.

2153
02:04:00,670 --> 02:04:02,070
Oh my god.

2154
02:04:02,170 --> 02:04:02,690
Oh shoot.

2155
02:04:02,830 --> 02:04:03,310
Oh my god.

2156
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:04,310
I almost...

2157
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:08,670
Oh my god.

2158
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:11,310
I thought I was...

2159
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:15,630
Oh, ow, ow.

2160
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,360
Oh my god.

2161
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:32,720
No!

2162
02:04:44,630 --> 02:04:45,050
Wait.

2163
02:04:45,730 --> 02:04:48,190
I don't have to start from the very beginning, do I?

2164
02:04:49,150 --> 02:04:50,050
With the yellow?

2165
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,860
Where's the thingy?

2166
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,040
Oh, there it is.

2167
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:01,920
It won't let me jump in this area for some reason.

2168
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:02,380
Oh, ok.

2169
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:03,180
Yellow is still lit.

2170
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:04,280
Okie dokie.

2171
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:06,660
Let's go back to hot lady.

2172
02:05:15,170 --> 02:05:16,710
Just taking screenshots.

2173
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:25,720
Now you will become hot.

2174
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:28,360
Oh shoot.

2175
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:31,400
I forgot that's what happened when she said that.

2176
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:42,060
I love spamming gun.

2177
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:48,440
Let's...

2178
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:49,380
Ok.

2179
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:50,020
Come here.

2180
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:51,160
Come here ma'am.

2181
02:05:57,970 --> 02:05:59,670
You got one little pair of bats.

2182
02:06:01,610 --> 02:06:03,230
No, I won't become tired.

2183
02:06:03,770 --> 02:06:04,770
I'm wide awake.

2184
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,990
Waste all your bats.

2185
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:23,050
Oh, nice.

2186
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:25,710
Waste all your bats.

2187
02:06:25,890 --> 02:06:26,690
I'm killing your bats.

2188
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:27,930
I'm killing your bats.

2189
02:06:30,850 --> 02:06:32,950
Get ready.

2190
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:34,430
Sugar.

2191
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:40,970
Sugar.

2192
02:06:44,230 --> 02:06:45,250
It's my favorite line.

2193
02:06:55,850 --> 02:06:58,650
Ma'am.

2194
02:06:59,050 --> 02:06:59,410
Up.

2195
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,430
I forgot I didn't have air hike.

2196
02:07:06,790 --> 02:07:07,930
Pain, pain, pain, pain.

2197
02:07:08,110 --> 02:07:08,450
It's ok.

2198
02:07:09,690 --> 02:07:09,930
Come here.

2199
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:11,470
Come here ma'am.

2200
02:07:16,330 --> 02:07:16,970
Oh my god.

2201
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:17,430
Oh my god.

2202
02:07:17,470 --> 02:07:18,530
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2203
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:24,970
Not really.

2204
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:28,870
I'm so bad at avoiding those.

2205
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:39,580
There we go.

2206
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:45,180
I will.

2207
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,400
No, I'm not.

2208
02:07:53,230 --> 02:07:54,510
Why are you combining?

2209
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:01,300
Oh my god.

2210
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:02,540
I thought she would stop.

2211
02:08:02,980 --> 02:08:03,480
Sugar.

2212
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:07,780
Come here.

2213
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:08,300
Come here.

2214
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,220
Come here.

2215
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:13,620
Take it.

2216
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:14,440
Take my ice.

2217
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:22,150
Taking out your bats.

2218
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:23,170
I'm taking out your bats.

2219
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:25,230
No,

2220
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:29,170
no, no, no, no.

2221
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:41,730
I'm taking out your bats.

2222
02:08:42,070 --> 02:08:42,830
Taking out your bats.

2223
02:08:43,610 --> 02:08:44,710
Taking out your bats.

2224
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:47,650
Taking out your bats.

2225
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:07,620
Give me a hug lady.

2226
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:08,420
I'm so lonely.

2227
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,420
Get rekt.

2228
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:16,100
Sugar.

2229
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:18,860
Yeah, I love that part.

2230
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,580
I forgot I had double dip.

2231
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:29,920
I can't see.

2232
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:31,380
Why are there so many bats on the side?

2233
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:34,940
Oh, come on.

2234
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:39,720
Oh my god.

2235
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,000
Ah, sugar.

2236
02:09:49,970 --> 02:09:52,450
I'm not enjoying myself.

2237
02:09:54,450 --> 02:09:58,190
I'm just gonna let my DT go.

2238
02:09:59,050 --> 02:10:03,830
Because I don't have...

2239
02:10:05,990 --> 02:10:08,090
Because I need more health.

2240
02:10:10,830 --> 02:10:11,390
Oh my gosh.

2241
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:16,070
Oh gosh.

2242
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:19,010
Ah.

2243
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,200
Sugar.

2244
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:31,780
Sugar.

2245
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:37,500
Sugar.

2246
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:43,920
Come on lady.

2247
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:44,880
Come on lady.

2248
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:46,180
Oh, come on lady.

2249
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:58,510
Okay, maybe one, two more time.

2250
02:11:01,570 --> 02:11:02,090
Maybe.

2251
02:11:06,030 --> 02:11:06,930
Ah, sugar.

2252
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:12,230
Oh, more hug.

2253
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:13,130
Oh gosh.

2254
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:13,590
Oh no.

2255
02:11:15,070 --> 02:11:15,950
Get me out.

2256
02:11:16,270 --> 02:11:16,730
Get me out.

2257
02:11:16,990 --> 02:11:17,630
Get me out.

2258
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:18,790
Get me out.

2259
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,540
I wanted the hug.

2260
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:33,500
I asked for the hug all this time.

2261
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,400
And then I blew it.

2262
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:39,890
I blew it!

2263
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:46,880
Oh my god.

2264
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:48,400
I hate these ones.

2265
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:49,860
They are scary.

2266
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:50,420
Oh

2267
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:05,940
my health.

2268
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:06,880
My health.

2269
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:08,260
I'm so scared.

2270
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,500
Ah, sugar.

2271
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:21,260
Get my DT up.

2272
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:21,960
Get my DT up.

2273
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:22,600
Get my DT up.

2274
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:24,000
I'll play it cool.

2275
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:25,440
I'll play it safer now.

2276
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:27,140
I'll play it safer now.

2277
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:29,020
I'll play it safer now.

2278
02:12:30,380 --> 02:12:32,020
Play it safer now.

2279
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:37,710
No!

2280
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:39,450
This is the least favorite one.

2281
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:42,650
Oh shit.

2282
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:48,030
Come on.

2283
02:12:48,110 --> 02:12:48,250
Come on.

2284
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:49,130
Get out Dante.

2285
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:56,840
You stupid.

2286
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:59,640
You stupid lady.

2287
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:00,780
Oh my god.

2288
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:01,020
Wait.

2289
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:02,180
How did I get so much...

2290
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:03,360
How did I lose so much health?

2291
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:03,640
No.

2292
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:07,140
I lost all the health.

2293
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,560
I lost it all.

2294
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:09,000
No.

2295
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:10,900
No.

2296
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:14,180
No.

2297
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,100
Are you enjoying yourself?

2298
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:32,540
Are

2299
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,780
you enjoying yourself?

2300
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,940
Are you enjoying yourself?

2301
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,780
Are you enjoying yourself?

2302
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:48,060
Oh my god.

2303
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:50,800
Please Dante.

2304
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:52,840
Okay.

2305
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:59,130
I...

2306
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:01,890
Fear.

2307
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:05,230
I fear.

2308
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,690
No.

2309
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:09,390
Please.

2310
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:12,390
Please.

2311
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:14,350
Oh shit.

2312
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:18,050
Okay.

2313
02:14:18,430 --> 02:14:18,590
Alright.

2314
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:19,210
I'm going in.

2315
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:19,790
I'm going in.

2316
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:42,620
Come here man.

2317
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:45,020
I'm attacking you.

2318
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,100
I'm attacking you.

2319
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:46,600
Please.

2320
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:47,360
There we go.

2321
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:51,680
I was so close to beating you before.

2322
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:52,520
I was so close.

2323
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:54,400
I was just like one little thing away.

2324
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:54,500
Please.

2325
02:14:57,100 --> 02:14:59,180
I was so close.

2326
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:01,340
I was so close.

2327
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:02,200
Oh my god.

2328
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:04,280
You.

2329
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:06,500
You.

2330
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:09,600
No.

2331
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:10,860
This is it.

2332
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:11,500
That's it.

2333
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:14,800
I jumped.

2334
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:15,900
I jumped.

2335
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,720
I jumped.

2336
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:18,340
I jumped.

2337
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:19,120
I jumped.

2338
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:19,980
I jumped.

2339
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,880
I jumped.

2340
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:28,300
I jumped.

2341
02:15:31,060 --> 02:15:31,800
I jumped.

2342
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,700
Why does

2343
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:48,700
it have to be a boss rush?

2344
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:51,440
Why?

2345
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:55,240
Why does it have to be a boss rush?

2346
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:58,020
I'm already in a pissy enough mood.

2347
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:04,120
We won't tell anyone you're doing it for the purpose to get a kiss from sexy demon lady.

2348
02:16:04,260 --> 02:16:06,100
Yeah, don't tell my secret, okay?

2349
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:15,120
Come here lady.

2350
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:17,640
You wish you were lady.

2351
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:21,340
I actually just don't know your name.

2352
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:24,680
And I don't care to learn it.

2353
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:26,200
Sugar.

2354
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:31,720
Come here.

2355
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:33,740
Nevermind.

2356
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:35,420
I was coming to you.

2357
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:50,370
See, I lose health there.

2358
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:50,970
So annoying.

2359
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:53,430
So annoying.

2360
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,160
Oh shoot.

2361
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,720
I forgot that's what she did there.

2362
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:07,520
I was not.

2363
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:09,400
I gotta lock in.

2364
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,540
Gotta lock in on the lady.

2365
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:16,120
Lock in on lady.

2366
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:21,000
Okay, come here.

2367
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:22,880
Okay.

2368
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:24,780
I'm sleepy.

2369
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:26,120
I'm so tired.

2370
02:17:26,300 --> 02:17:26,920
I'm so tired.

2371
02:17:27,140 --> 02:17:28,100
Oh dang it.

2372
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:28,680
Why?

2373
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:29,180
Why?

2374
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:40,860
Okay.

2375
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:45,100
There we go.

2376
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:46,440
Big damage.

2377
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:47,240
No!

2378
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:48,340
Not enough damage.

2379
02:17:51,060 --> 02:17:51,940
Not enough damage.

2380
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:53,960
Okay.

2381
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:55,820
The floor is lava!

2382
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:03,840
The floor is lava!

2383
02:18:10,650 --> 02:18:12,980
Are you enjoying yourself?

2384
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:16,860
Sugar.

2385
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:19,160
Alright, come here.

2386
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:25,000
I'm not hitting her at all.

2387
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:30,080
The floor is lava!

2388
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:39,780
No I'm not.

2389
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:40,640
I hate this one.

2390
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:41,640
Oh my god.

2391
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:42,300
Oh my god.

2392
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:45,060
And then she spin.

2393
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:46,580
No she don't spin.

2394
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:47,440
She spin?

2395
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,340
She don't spin.

2396
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:49,480
Sometimes she spin.

2397
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:50,700
Sometimes she don't spin.

2398
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:52,220
Sometimes she spin.

2399
02:18:52,620 --> 02:18:53,540
And the floor is lava!

2400
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:58,360
Oh my god.

2401
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:01,340
Okay.

2402
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:07,980
Stop spamming this.

2403
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:11,960
Oh my god.

2404
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:12,200
See?

2405
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:13,860
This is so stupid.

2406
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:16,900
Oh my god.

2407
02:19:17,020 --> 02:19:17,320
Lady.

2408
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:18,800
Sugar.

2409
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:23,700
Yeah!

2410
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:25,620
Damage.

2411
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,160
Not biggest damage though.

2412
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:30,320
Could have been bigger damage.

2413
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,360
Lady.

2414
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,870
And the floor...

2415
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:36,600
Is lava!

2416
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:40,640
Oh my god!

2417
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:44,200
Let me out of here first!

2418
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:49,920
Sugar.

2419
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:57,210
It doesn't matter if you get close to her or not.

2420
02:19:57,290 --> 02:19:59,450
Because it doesn't negate that attack.

2421
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:00,390
You know what I mean?

2422
02:20:02,190 --> 02:20:02,730
Lava!

2423
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:05,650
It doesn't make her stop doing it.

2424
02:20:05,830 --> 02:20:06,190
See?

2425
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:07,570
Oh gosh.

2426
02:20:07,590 --> 02:20:08,230
It's so annoying.

2427
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:11,070
I'm not...

2428
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:13,110
I'm not enjoying myself.

2429
02:20:17,650 --> 02:20:19,210
Are you gonna spin?

2430
02:20:19,770 --> 02:20:20,490
Are you gonna spin?

2431
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:21,690
Are you gonna spin?

2432
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:24,230
Nope.

2433
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:26,410
I thought I had her.

2434
02:20:27,430 --> 02:20:28,370
I thought I had her.

2435
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:34,810
Oh my god.

2436
02:20:56,770 --> 02:20:58,530
Floor is lava!

2437
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,250
What?

2438
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:06,510
Did she spam this so much before too?

2439
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:09,330
I don't remember her using this attack like...

2440
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:09,830
Oh my god.

2441
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:10,070
No!

2442
02:21:10,210 --> 02:21:10,410
No!

2443
02:21:10,510 --> 02:21:10,650
No!

2444
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:10,790
No!

2445
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:12,370
Like exclusively.

2446
02:21:13,810 --> 02:21:16,390
I don't remember her spamming it so much.

2447
02:21:18,630 --> 02:21:20,050
She does spam it a lot?

2448
02:21:22,390 --> 02:21:23,350
Not done.

2449
02:21:24,870 --> 02:21:25,270
Lava!

2450
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:49,440
Lava!

2451
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:54,000
Oh my god.

2452
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:55,180
I just wanna get one...

2453
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:55,760
Ah, shit.

2454
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:07,440
There we go.

2455
02:22:08,140 --> 02:22:08,660
There we go.

2456
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:09,720
There we go.

2457
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:10,820
Come on!

2458
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:16,600
Okay.

2459
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:19,720
Is she trying to kiss me?

2460
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:28,320
Okay.

2461
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:30,380
We got her kiss.

2462
02:22:30,480 --> 02:22:31,440
We got away from the kiss.

2463
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:47,540
How do I get out of the kiss?

2464
02:22:59,180 --> 02:22:59,740
DT?

2465
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:01,580
Oh my fucking god.

2466
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:19,580
So mad.

2467
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:35,680
I have to do this again.

2468
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:37,900
Oh my god.

2469
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,000
I tried dodging and it didn't work.

2470
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:01,780
I'd be fine if it was like the final boss, you know?

2471
02:24:03,700 --> 02:24:05,600
In fact, I have to do all of them again.

2472
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:09,100
Sucks so much.

2473
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:18,520
And now she's back to phase 1.

2474
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,200
I don't know if I should be grateful for her or not.

2475
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:26,140
I don't even have any motivation.

2476
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:27,260
I have no motivation!

2477
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:27,420
No motivation!

2478
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:32,620
Give

2479
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:51,440
me my health back, please.

2480
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:05,800
No, I really not.

2481
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:08,340
I want my money back.

2482
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:20,550
Lady!

2483
02:25:22,950 --> 02:25:26,870
I'm never frequenting this establishment ever again.

2484
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:28,890
I never thought I would!

2485
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:00,550
Okay, you're still going.

2486
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:02,710
You go for such a long time.

2487
02:26:02,990 --> 02:26:03,890
You're so extra.

2488
02:26:05,330 --> 02:26:08,850
Oh my god, as soon as I try to get closer...

2489
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:12,750
And then she's gonna say, are you enjoying yourself?

2490
02:26:15,630 --> 02:26:15,810
No!

2491
02:26:28,310 --> 02:26:29,910
Are you though?

2492
02:26:30,030 --> 02:26:32,550
Oh yeah, having a great time.

2493
02:26:34,470 --> 02:26:36,550
I'm so fucking dumb with this game.

2494
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:51,600
No, god!

2495
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:52,680
Fuck me!

2496
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:02,580
No!

2497
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:12,740
No, I'm not!

2498
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:23,210
Okay!

2499
02:27:27,930 --> 02:27:30,450
Get my health back.

2500
02:27:30,930 --> 02:27:32,290
Getting my health back.

2501
02:27:38,710 --> 02:27:40,350
Getting DP back.

2502
02:27:43,330 --> 02:27:44,990
Oh god, oh god, oh god, again!

2503
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:50,290
She's doing that!

2504
02:27:50,430 --> 02:27:51,330
She's doing that!

2505
02:27:51,450 --> 02:27:52,430
She's doing that!

2506
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:56,960
Come on, wimp!

2507
02:28:06,390 --> 02:28:06,910
Okay.

2508
02:28:12,030 --> 02:28:12,590
Okay.

2509
02:28:15,490 --> 02:28:16,050
Okay.

2510
02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:21,730
Alright, and we attack, attack, attack, attack, attack...

2511
02:28:24,510 --> 02:28:27,870
Okay, we gotta save some DT though.

2512
02:28:28,830 --> 02:28:30,210
We gotta save some DT.

2513
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:30,810
Okay.

2514
02:28:30,810 --> 02:28:35,150
Alright, shoot shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty shooty.

2515
02:28:35,230 --> 02:28:36,710
Okay, come on.

2516
02:28:37,450 --> 02:28:37,930
ARGH!

2517
02:28:45,810 --> 02:28:47,190
Well, I-I did it.

2518
02:28:47,310 --> 02:28:48,030
I did escape.

2519
02:28:48,310 --> 02:28:48,710
Mwahahaha.

2520
02:28:49,750 --> 02:28:50,710
Come on!

2521
02:28:56,820 --> 02:28:57,300
Okay.

2522
02:29:08,050 --> 02:29:08,410
Okay.

2523
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:15,160
Oh,

2524
02:29:20,820 --> 02:29:20,980
wait.

2525
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:22,280
I don't know why I-I did that.

2526
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:24,260
I'm so used to just shooting her.

2527
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:26,460
It's okay, we didn't have DT, so...

2528
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:27,780
Alright.

2529
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:32,120
Now we do.

2530
02:29:40,130 --> 02:29:41,850
So close, so close.

2531
02:29:42,770 --> 02:29:44,570
So close, so close, so close.

2532
02:29:45,550 --> 02:29:47,290
So close, so close, so close.

2533
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:51,370
My health is good too.

2534
02:29:51,950 --> 02:29:53,070
But, you know.

2535
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:22,880
Alright, let's see what next bastard we want to take down.

2536
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:26,980
You're giving birth?

2537
02:30:27,300 --> 02:30:27,820
Congratulations.

2538
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:32,200
I can't tell from this one.

2539
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:33,560
Is this Beowulf?

2540
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:37,220
Will I just cry?

2541
02:30:38,740 --> 02:30:40,240
Is this Beowulf?

2542
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:41,640
Yes?

2543
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:43,860
Okay, I save for later.

2544
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:46,160
Maybe we should just do it though.

2545
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:47,380
Get it out of the way.

2546
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:48,400
What's this one?

2547
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:51,840
Oh, this is the...

2548
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:55,320
The sky.

2549
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:57,860
We went inside his tummy.

2550
02:30:58,700 --> 02:30:59,540
The whale.

2551
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:12,360
You don't need to kill all bosses to beat this.

2552
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:14,300
You just need to make a circle using gems.

2553
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:16,240
IDK why everyone says you needed to.

2554
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:17,540
What?

2555
02:31:23,860 --> 02:31:25,540
I hate you guys.

2556
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:28,120
I hate you guys.

2557
02:31:31,180 --> 02:31:31,780
Except...

2558
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:32,360
Joe!

2559
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:34,400
Joe...

2560
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:36,240
Why do you guys...

2561
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:37,920
Why do you guys want to see me suffer?

2562
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:44,920
I hate you guys so much.

2563
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:46,200
Joe mama.

2564
02:31:51,950 --> 02:31:54,730
Oh my god, why do you guys want to see me suffer?

2565
02:31:54,730 --> 02:31:55,810
Like this.

2566
02:31:56,120 --> 02:31:56,750
Why?

2567
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:58,130
Okay.

2568
02:32:00,140 --> 02:32:01,250
My bad.

2569
02:32:02,530 --> 02:32:03,030
One second.

2570
02:32:08,390 --> 02:32:10,270
Devil Arms?

2571
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:12,130
Cerberus?

2572
02:32:13,540 --> 02:32:14,770
What was the combo?

2573
02:32:15,070 --> 02:32:15,810
Is it this one?

2574
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:19,390
No.

2575
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:23,700
Satellite?

2576
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:24,600
No.

2577
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:27,960
What's it called?

2578
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:29,580
Oh good, I was thinking it was the five gifted.

2579
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:31,620
Wait.

2580
02:32:32,120 --> 02:32:32,680
Swing?

2581
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:34,380
No.

2582
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:36,800
It's not Revolver.

2583
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:43,600
It's the one where we create the ice.

2584
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:50,400
Ice.

2585
02:32:52,460 --> 02:32:53,360
Ice Age?

2586
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:54,680
I don't even see that in here.

2587
02:32:57,980 --> 02:32:59,980
Oh, Sword Master Style.

2588
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:06,060
So I have to... Do I have to change my...

2589
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:11,440
Oh god.

2590
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,000
Oh, chew on this.

2591
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:22,840
Ha!

2592
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:25,140
Chew on this.

2593
02:33:25,780 --> 02:33:26,340
Ha!

2594
02:33:26,900 --> 02:33:28,000
Chew on this.

2595
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:29,260
Cool!

2596
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:30,800
Okay, let's go attack the...

2597
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:36,200
No!

2598
02:33:36,580 --> 02:33:38,000
Oh, I forgot to Devil Trigger.

2599
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:40,880
Oh, gosh.

2600
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:49,560
I end.

2601
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:52,040
Oh wait, no, no, no, no.

2602
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:52,460
Continue.

2603
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:54,140
Yes, oh my gosh.

2604
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:57,820
I'm about to... I'm literally about to quit it.

2605
02:34:02,180 --> 02:34:02,940
Hold on.

2606
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:04,400
Okay, so we gotta make a circle.

2607
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,460
I thought this was the flying...

2608
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:10,040
I didn't know it was actually the one in his stomach.

2609
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:10,640
Okay.

2610
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:12,860
So I have to make the circle.

2611
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:21,700
So I... Okay, so I just don't get the ones on the inside like Beowulf and then the blue one.

2612
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:24,060
So I just have to do everything else.

2613
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:32,640
Any circle you want?

2614
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:34,600
So it can even be a teeny tiny circle?

2615
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,400
You can make any circle!

2616
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:39,080
No way.

2617
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,260
Oh, but...

2618
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:42,780
If I make a tiny circle, I have to fight Beowulf.

2619
02:34:51,910 --> 02:34:53,410
But we could do...

2620
02:34:58,160 --> 02:34:58,900
What's green?

2621
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:01,520
Let's go see and check out what green is.

2622
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:03,400
This is...

2623
02:35:07,850 --> 02:35:08,910
I don't remember.

2624
02:35:10,350 --> 02:35:12,530
Oh, you guys!

2625
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:13,770
I like fighting you.

2626
02:35:20,700 --> 02:35:22,520
I use you to fight you.

2627
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:36,960
Wait.

2628
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:37,760
Okay, hold on.

2629
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:39,800
I'm remembering how to do this.

2630
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:41,940
I think I wanna be Trickster.

2631
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:45,260
Okay.

2632
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:46,140
Oh, hold on, hold on.

2633
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:47,860
I can't see anything!

2634
02:35:48,700 --> 02:35:49,760
I can't see!

2635
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:50,660
The camera!

2636
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:52,620
I

2637
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:00,720
have no heads!

2638
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:03,360
That's so sad.

2639
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:05,320
Oh.

2640
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:06,540
Okay, hold on.

2641
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:14,410
Okay.

2642
02:36:14,810 --> 02:36:15,290
Oh, god.

2643
02:36:15,510 --> 02:36:16,810
Camera, camera, camera, camera, camera!

2644
02:36:18,210 --> 02:36:18,570
Camera!

2645
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:30,220
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2646
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:30,880
I'm such an idiot.

2647
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:32,980
I keep forgetting I'm not in sword mode.

2648
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:34,620
You know?

2649
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:35,660
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2650
02:36:36,300 --> 02:36:39,020
Only blue, only blue, only blue, only blue, only blue!

2651
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:46,190
Actually, wait.

2652
02:36:46,270 --> 02:36:47,230
We get them both down.

2653
02:36:47,270 --> 02:36:47,670
That's right.

2654
02:36:47,810 --> 02:36:48,110
Hold on.

2655
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:48,570
I remember.

2656
02:36:49,190 --> 02:36:49,630
I remember.

2657
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:53,150
We have to get them both down pretty low.

2658
02:36:56,110 --> 02:36:57,390
Otherwise they'll combine.

2659
02:36:58,090 --> 02:36:58,590
I remember.

2660
02:37:17,130 --> 02:37:18,170
Oh, come on!

2661
02:37:18,330 --> 02:37:18,990
Come on!

2662
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:30,300
I used to beat them before.

2663
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:30,960
I can't remember.

2664
02:37:38,820 --> 02:37:39,220
Oh,

2665
02:37:42,260 --> 02:37:42,980
no, no, no!

2666
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:49,940
You bastard.

2667
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:57,900
Server's guarantee is buried.

2668
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:59,020
Is that true?

2669
02:38:17,330 --> 02:38:19,150
Oh, you... I went the wrong way.

2670
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:33,160
Oh, shoot.

2671
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:33,400
Wait.

2672
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:36,340
Okay.

2673
02:38:36,340 --> 02:38:37,660
Let's focus on you again.

2674
02:38:40,140 --> 02:38:42,200
In fact, I'm gonna... Never mind.

2675
02:38:51,110 --> 02:38:51,550
Come here.

2676
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:52,050
Come here.

2677
02:38:52,470 --> 02:38:52,910
Come here.

2678
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:09,240
No, stop.

2679
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:09,620
It's a window.

2680
02:39:13,260 --> 02:39:14,900
I can't see.

2681
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,160
Oh, come on!

2682
02:39:19,380 --> 02:39:21,120
I'm such an ass.

2683
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:27,180
Okay, he's down.

2684
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:28,900
Now, servers.

2685
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:40,880
Is it gonna...

2686
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:43,480
So close.

2687
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:46,080
Is it gonna enhance their health?

2688
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:47,140
Since there's two of them.

2689
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:51,200
Can you stop with the theatrics?

2690
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:52,320
I've seen this part before.

2691
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:56,660
Oh my god.

2692
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:05,780
I was so close.

2693
02:40:06,060 --> 02:40:06,740
Oh my god, please.

2694
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:07,820
Just fight back, Dante.

2695
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:08,520
Just fight back.

2696
02:40:09,540 --> 02:40:10,560
Just fight back, Dante!

2697
02:40:20,740 --> 02:40:22,660
Did you see how much health he had?

2698
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:25,340
Did you see that?

2699
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:27,000
Did you see that?

2700
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:29,400
He totally should've been dead.

2701
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,620
He should've been down.

2702
02:40:30,760 --> 02:40:31,760
He should've been down.

2703
02:40:32,180 --> 02:40:33,260
He should've been down.

2704
02:40:33,380 --> 02:40:33,960
He should've been down.

2705
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:34,800
He should've been down.

2706
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:36,660
Yeah, call the referee.

2707
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:40,120
Ref, this guy is playing unfair.

2708
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:46,400
I think I went down here.

2709
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:49,100
We'll just fight him again, I guess.

2710
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:52,760
I hate this so freaking much.

2711
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:54,580
Okay.

2712
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:59,660
I don't care who I focus on first.

2713
02:40:59,980 --> 02:41:01,000
I focus on someone.

2714
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:02,300
I'm focusing on someone.

2715
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:03,700
I'm focusing on someone.

2716
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:05,060
I'm focusing on anybody.

2717
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:06,640
I don't really care right now.

2718
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:13,580
Yeah, I'm focusing on you.

2719
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:21,620
These guys are so much less annoying than the lady, though.

2720
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:25,620
Doesn't matter if she's sexy.

2721
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:27,900
Pisses me off.

2722
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:33,160
Hot women aren't supposed to piss you off.

2723
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:35,320
That's just not how that's supposed to go.

2724
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:40,260
I tried to dodge.

2725
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:41,180
I tried to dodge.

2726
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:41,980
Okay, you.

2727
02:41:48,900 --> 02:41:50,860
Alright, don't get him so down, though.

2728
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:52,520
Don't get him so down, though.

2729
02:41:54,320 --> 02:41:55,920
Okay, should be good for now.

2730
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:00,520
Come on.

2731
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:02,920
Alright, red guy.

2732
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:05,340
Red.

2733
02:42:09,090 --> 02:42:10,470
Oh, wow, that was so fast.

2734
02:42:10,990 --> 02:42:12,390
I wish I had any double trigger.

2735
02:42:12,630 --> 02:42:13,030
Double trigger.

2736
02:42:13,250 --> 02:42:13,610
Double trigger.

2737
02:42:13,790 --> 02:42:14,130
Double trigger.

2738
02:42:14,830 --> 02:42:15,370
Double trigger.

2739
02:42:15,690 --> 02:42:15,970
Double trigger.

2740
02:42:16,270 --> 02:42:16,630
Fast.

2741
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:18,030
Fast as much as I can.

2742
02:42:20,890 --> 02:42:23,250
Okay, I need to get the other guys more, though.

2743
02:42:24,150 --> 02:42:25,670
Huge damage, I know, right?

2744
02:42:31,730 --> 02:42:32,330
Red.

2745
02:42:41,950 --> 02:42:42,550
Shoot.

2746
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:53,440
No!

2747
02:42:53,660 --> 02:42:53,820
No!

2748
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:54,180
No!

2749
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:54,460
No!

2750
02:43:04,410 --> 02:43:06,910
I'm too strong for my own good.

2751
02:43:07,530 --> 02:43:09,910
I won't let you skip this cutscene.

2752
02:43:09,910 --> 02:43:11,930
I'm too strong for my own good.

2753
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:12,980
I can't control my...

2754
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:16,070
I can't control myself.

2755
02:43:16,670 --> 02:43:19,190
Am I healing during all of this?

2756
02:43:19,350 --> 02:43:22,910
Or like... Is my double trigger just like...

2757
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,690
Oh my god.

2758
02:43:24,830 --> 02:43:25,370
Oh god.

2759
02:43:28,650 --> 02:43:29,450
Ah, shoot.

2760
02:43:32,690 --> 02:43:34,190
Just keep going, Dante!

2761
02:43:35,410 --> 02:43:36,270
Just keep going!

2762
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:37,630
Dante, don't stop!

2763
02:43:37,890 --> 02:43:38,950
Don't stop, Dante!

2764
02:43:39,570 --> 02:43:41,370
Don't stop the nunchucks!

2765
02:43:42,210 --> 02:43:42,810
Dante!

2766
02:43:44,890 --> 02:43:47,410
Dante, don't stop the nunchucks!

2767
02:43:48,990 --> 02:43:50,030
Don't stop!

2768
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:01,620
What's the blue one?

2769
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:03,060
The light blue.

2770
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:05,540
Is there anything else down here?

2771
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:07,680
Oh, a grower.

2772
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:08,360
Thanks.

2773
02:44:10,820 --> 02:44:12,160
And... Is that it?

2774
02:44:15,100 --> 02:44:16,760
This is the dark blue.

2775
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:20,320
Where's the light blue?

2776
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:22,480
Oh, the light blue is the horse?

2777
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:25,200
That one is so not bad.

2778
02:44:27,180 --> 02:44:28,440
Let's find it.

2779
02:44:29,400 --> 02:44:30,100
The horns.

2780
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:33,580
Oh, light blue is probably Cerberus?

2781
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:36,180
Well...

2782
02:44:44,270 --> 02:44:45,670
No, dark blue is horse.

2783
02:44:45,850 --> 02:44:46,930
Okay, that was the horse.

2784
02:44:47,050 --> 02:44:50,270
Well, do we want to do Beowulf again?

2785
02:44:51,050 --> 02:44:51,790
You know what?

2786
02:44:52,250 --> 02:44:54,010
Let's do the horse and Beowulf.

2787
02:44:54,290 --> 02:44:54,930
I don't care.

2788
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:56,110
I don't care!

2789
02:44:56,970 --> 02:44:58,030
I don't care.

2790
02:44:59,030 --> 02:45:03,250
At least I know I'm getting myself out of here if I do Beowulf.

2791
02:45:03,250 --> 02:45:03,310
Beowulf.

2792
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:10,570
How the hell did I do this before?

2793
02:45:16,010 --> 02:45:19,370
I just... I gotta find the horses back!

2794
02:45:24,330 --> 02:45:26,490
I think I'm just gonna start blasting.

2795
02:45:32,860 --> 02:45:34,100
Damn, he ran me over.

2796
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:35,740
I don't

2797
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:42,620
remember how the hell I did any of these fights.

2798
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:44,320
What the hell is wrong with me?

2799
02:45:45,140 --> 02:45:46,420
Why don't I remember anything?

2800
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:56,220
And then he teleports me and I...

2801
02:46:04,950 --> 02:46:06,870
That was a rhetorical question.

2802
02:46:07,090 --> 02:46:08,130
You don't need to say anything.

2803
02:46:08,790 --> 02:46:12,050
You don't need to be like, you're just bad at the game.

2804
02:46:13,810 --> 02:46:15,290
That was a rhetorical question.

2805
02:46:16,350 --> 02:46:18,970
You know, I need to pay attention.

2806
02:46:19,290 --> 02:46:19,890
Oh, Jesus.

2807
02:46:21,750 --> 02:46:24,430
I don't wanna fight any of these guys anymore.

2808
02:46:24,910 --> 02:46:26,310
I don't wanna do it anymore.

2809
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:35,740
I don't wanna do it anymore.

2810
02:46:46,940 --> 02:46:47,820
I don't mind.

2811
02:46:47,940 --> 02:46:51,180
You say worst bosses are yet to come, but I don't mind fighting new guys.

2812
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:54,080
I'd rather much fight new guys than fight old guys.

2813
02:46:54,580 --> 02:46:56,860
Fighting old guys is the worst thing.

2814
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:02,540
Like, I hate that.

2815
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:06,320
I hate fighting bosses that I've already done.

2816
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:12,040
Especially if it's the same exact fight.

2817
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:15,800
I'm just gonna die here.

2818
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:17,060
I don't...

2819
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:18,040
Kill me, horse.

2820
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:18,660
Kill me.

2821
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:25,220
She hates old guys.

2822
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:28,060
Cerberus is right here.

2823
02:47:29,860 --> 02:47:31,260
Maybe I should just do that instead.

2824
02:47:33,980 --> 02:47:34,720
Hey, buddy.

2825
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:37,000
It's been a long time.

2826
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:39,900
Oh, wow.

2827
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:41,460
It's been a long time.

2828
02:47:42,820 --> 02:47:43,340
Wait.

2829
02:47:43,480 --> 02:47:44,580
Oh, I'm a trickster?

2830
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:55,440
Oh, I'm not a trickster anymore.

2831
02:47:57,080 --> 02:47:58,380
Okay, okay, okay.

2832
02:47:58,680 --> 02:47:59,620
Oh my god.

2833
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:00,980
Oh my god.

2834
02:48:01,080 --> 02:48:02,920
Okay, I'm getting lost in the sauce.

2835
02:48:07,810 --> 02:48:09,690
I'm getting so lost in the sauce.

2836
02:48:58,890 --> 02:48:59,670
We're shooting.

2837
02:49:00,590 --> 02:49:01,850
We're rooting, tilting, shooting.

2838
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,000
Oh, you're scooting over.

2839
02:49:17,490 --> 02:49:18,010
Okay.

2840
02:49:18,750 --> 02:49:19,190
Already?

2841
02:49:19,510 --> 02:49:20,070
Oh my god.

2842
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:44,080
You're so fast.

2843
02:49:44,720 --> 02:49:45,760
Don't even have time to...

2844
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:47,520
Oh god.

2845
02:49:47,620 --> 02:49:48,180
Oh god.

2846
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:51,580
I'm just trying to blast you.

2847
02:49:55,430 --> 02:49:56,150
Oh, shoot.

2848
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:14,640
Okay.

2849
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:15,500
What did I do?

2850
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:17,340
How did I earn that?

2851
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:30,820
Oh gosh.

2852
02:50:30,940 --> 02:50:31,220
Oh gosh.

2853
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:31,540
Oh gosh.

2854
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:31,840
Oh gosh.

2855
02:50:41,570 --> 02:50:42,630
Just gonna GT.

2856
02:50:49,690 --> 02:50:50,290
Come on.

2857
02:50:50,390 --> 02:50:50,710
Come on.

2858
02:50:50,750 --> 02:50:51,030
Come on.

2859
02:50:51,090 --> 02:50:51,450
Come on.

2860
02:50:51,770 --> 02:50:52,570
So close.

2861
02:50:54,290 --> 02:50:55,090
Come on.

2862
02:50:55,890 --> 02:50:56,770
Just one doggy.

2863
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:58,270
Just one dog left.

2864
02:50:59,150 --> 02:50:59,390
No.

2865
02:51:02,650 --> 02:51:03,470
Chip him away.

2866
02:51:03,610 --> 02:51:04,110
Chip him away.

2867
02:51:04,510 --> 02:51:05,110
Chip him away.

2868
02:51:05,250 --> 02:51:05,730
Chip him away.

2869
02:51:10,170 --> 02:51:10,670
Okay.

2870
02:51:12,530 --> 02:51:13,930
Alright, we got the dog.

2871
02:51:20,190 --> 02:51:22,170
Why did he give me robs?

2872
02:51:22,230 --> 02:51:22,970
Nobody else did.

2873
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:33,640
Beowulf?

2874
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,440
What's the orange one?

2875
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:54,160
I don't think it's red or orange.

2876
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:55,440
It's red and orange, right?

2877
02:52:00,300 --> 02:52:02,760
I don't know what orange is.

2878
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:09,360
Yeah, red is Leviathan and I hate that one.

2879
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:10,520
It's not bad.

2880
02:52:10,620 --> 02:52:12,300
It's just, you know...

2881
02:52:13,880 --> 02:52:14,400
Doppelganger?

2882
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:15,120
Really?

2883
02:52:15,340 --> 02:52:16,420
You have to fight him again?

2884
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:18,260
He even counts?

2885
02:52:19,380 --> 02:52:20,280
That guy.

2886
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:21,740
I just fought him.

2887
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:24,180
What are we looking at here?

2888
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:27,700
26.

2889
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:34,540
I can beat Beowulf with his own fists.

2890
02:52:42,430 --> 02:52:44,190
I don't even know where orange is.

2891
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:46,710
This was...

2892
02:52:46,710 --> 02:52:47,910
Oh, never mind.

2893
02:52:47,970 --> 02:52:48,870
I don't think I went here.

2894
02:52:52,930 --> 02:52:54,310
What is this one?

2895
02:52:57,110 --> 02:52:59,730
That looks like my doppelganger.

2896
02:53:06,410 --> 02:53:08,730
Oh, I just went in a big old circle.

2897
02:53:11,370 --> 02:53:12,250
That's doppelganger.

2898
02:53:12,430 --> 02:53:14,930
Okay, so my intuition was correct.

2899
02:53:15,070 --> 02:53:16,030
Okay, maybe up here.

2900
02:53:16,810 --> 02:53:19,090
I just want to see what it looks like with the orange.

2901
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:21,130
Hello.

2902
02:53:25,550 --> 02:53:26,430
I cannot

2903
02:53:31,160 --> 02:53:33,860
tell.

2904
02:53:34,220 --> 02:53:35,180
Then there's the horse.

2905
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:42,640
The reaper miniboss?

2906
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:43,480
No way.

2907
02:53:44,080 --> 02:53:45,680
It's just one of the scythe guys?

2908
02:53:48,140 --> 02:53:50,240
They are like, do you remember your trauma?

2909
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:55,700
Okay, they thought it was difficult enough at the very beginning of the game that they...

2910
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:57,600
That they actually included it here.

2911
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:58,360
That's insane.

2912
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:02,620
That's so funny.

2913
02:54:03,440 --> 02:54:06,680
They are like, yeah, we know that we fucked up.

2914
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:07,200
We know.

2915
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:11,860
We know that that mission was so hard.

2916
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:14,980
Anyway, you made it here.

2917
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:17,680
Anyway, you did it.

2918
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:18,240
You're here.

2919
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:19,100
You know?

2920
02:54:28,780 --> 02:54:31,140
How the hell did we do this?

2921
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:34,980
Oh, I'm on gunslinger.

2922
02:54:41,540 --> 02:54:44,180
This one is not so badly...

2923
02:54:44,180 --> 02:54:48,320
Like, this one is a little bit more fresh in my mind at least.

2924
02:54:55,010 --> 02:54:57,870
And I have a double dash now too, which is kind of cool.

2925
02:55:12,550 --> 02:55:14,910
My dash did not...

2926
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:24,180
Okay, I know everyone was like, you need to be more aggressive with him.

2927
02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:26,620
Ah, shoot.

2928
02:55:31,170 --> 02:55:32,190
Oh my god.

2929
02:55:32,450 --> 02:55:33,430
Double dash.

2930
02:55:33,850 --> 02:55:34,470
Double dash.

2931
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:38,930
I think I basically do this.

2932
02:55:41,750 --> 02:55:46,510
Oh, I have... I do this until he like starts...

2933
02:55:48,550 --> 02:55:49,350
Oh, shoot.

2934
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:50,730
Can I double?

2935
02:55:51,430 --> 02:55:52,470
Oh, I can.

2936
02:55:52,630 --> 02:55:53,390
Oh, that's so powerful.

2937
02:55:56,230 --> 02:56:00,150
Oh, I can just leap over his head.

2938
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:12,760
Until he does the thing and then I stinger those.

2939
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:15,860
Oh my god.

2940
02:56:16,380 --> 02:56:17,840
Oh my god.

2941
02:56:19,360 --> 02:56:20,900
I just leap over his head.

2942
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:23,520
Oh my god.

2943
02:56:23,740 --> 02:56:24,760
Oh my god.

2944
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:26,260
That's so powerful.

2945
02:56:26,940 --> 02:56:27,980
That's so powerful.

2946
02:56:34,680 --> 02:56:36,700
Whatever works, I say.

2947
02:56:37,180 --> 02:56:38,100
Whatever works.

2948
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:45,940
Oh, I didn't escape fast enough or far enough.

2949
02:56:51,350 --> 02:56:52,690
Oh my god.

2950
02:56:53,410 --> 02:56:57,690
I don't trust myself to switch between trickster and... You know what?

2951
02:57:01,030 --> 02:57:01,850
Oh no.

2952
02:57:02,250 --> 02:57:02,710
That's it.

2953
02:57:02,790 --> 02:57:03,650
I don't trust myself.

2954
02:57:03,910 --> 02:57:04,710
I don't trust myself.

2955
02:57:16,110 --> 02:57:20,830
I'm just gonna keep... Okay, and then he turns into dog mode.

2956
02:57:21,390 --> 02:57:21,830
Where?

2957
02:57:22,450 --> 02:57:23,410
Okay, is it here?

2958
02:57:24,870 --> 02:57:25,430
Yeah.

2959
02:57:27,450 --> 02:57:29,390
Oh, I was not soon enough.

2960
02:57:29,510 --> 02:57:29,930
Oh my god.

2961
02:57:31,270 --> 02:57:31,990
Oh, okay.

2962
02:57:33,570 --> 02:57:35,310
Definitely screwed that up.

2963
02:57:35,390 --> 02:57:35,890
Wait, what?

2964
02:57:36,310 --> 02:57:37,770
How am I doing it wrong?

2965
02:57:39,350 --> 02:57:39,750
Guys?

2966
02:57:45,500 --> 02:57:46,880
Oh, it's sword master.

2967
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:48,360
That's right.

2968
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:49,100
That's okay.

2969
02:57:49,240 --> 02:57:50,300
I have to fight this guy again.

2970
02:58:13,240 --> 02:58:13,920
Is it here?

2971
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:14,720
Ah, nope.

2972
02:58:14,820 --> 02:58:15,040
Nope.

2973
02:58:15,220 --> 02:58:15,460
Nope.

2974
02:58:15,740 --> 02:58:16,020
Nope.

2975
02:58:16,360 --> 02:58:16,700
Nope.

2976
02:58:17,400 --> 02:58:17,840
Nope.

2977
02:58:18,320 --> 02:58:19,420
I'll... I'll... Get me out.

2978
02:58:19,540 --> 02:58:20,280
Get me out, please.

2979
02:58:27,880 --> 02:58:28,760
Oh damn.

2980
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:29,640
Oh god.

2981
02:58:29,880 --> 02:58:31,160
This is so messed up.

2982
02:58:37,750 --> 02:58:40,610
Okay, that was a big thing though to switch to the sword master.

2983
02:58:40,610 --> 02:58:43,890
Okay, thank you for the reminder, guys.

2984
02:58:43,990 --> 02:58:48,030
Okay, switch to sword master for that one part.

2985
02:58:48,970 --> 02:58:50,990
Okay, I think we can get him though.

2986
02:58:52,130 --> 02:58:53,410
I think we can get him though.

2987
02:58:53,470 --> 02:58:57,750
Like I said, he's a little bit more fresh in my mind to where I feel...

2988
02:58:58,330 --> 02:58:59,610
Oh wait, uh...

2989
02:59:11,560 --> 02:59:13,200
A little bit...

2990
02:59:16,460 --> 02:59:20,960
A little bit better about... I don't remember what the hell I...

2991
02:59:21,940 --> 02:59:25,560
I think I just kept blasting.

2992
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:30,960
I say he's fresh in my mind and at first phase I'm like...

2993
02:59:36,820 --> 02:59:37,660
That's okay.

2994
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:39,540
It works!

2995
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:39,660
Yes!

2996
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:43,000
Come

2997
02:59:48,490 --> 02:59:49,790
on, Biowoke.

2998
02:59:57,990 --> 02:59:59,990
One does need to get back into it.

2999
03:00:00,450 --> 03:00:04,810
One does need to get back into it.

3000
03:00:06,030 --> 03:00:08,570
So far, not so bad.

3001
03:00:09,210 --> 03:00:10,550
It's a little slow of a method.

3002
03:00:13,950 --> 03:00:21,470
It's a little slow of a method, but I'm... If you are a hare, I am the tortoise, okay?

3003
03:00:21,950 --> 03:00:29,550
Like, if you are... If you play like the hare, I play like the tortoise.

3004
03:00:31,150 --> 03:00:32,410
Oh, oh shoot.

3005
03:00:32,870 --> 03:00:33,130
No!

3006
03:00:33,130 --> 03:00:33,210
No!

3007
03:00:49,250 --> 03:00:51,470
Pretty sure the rules are reversed in this case.

3008
03:00:51,590 --> 03:00:52,030
What do you mean?

3009
03:00:54,090 --> 03:00:56,670
The hare goes fast and the tortoise is slow and steady.

3010
03:00:57,930 --> 03:00:58,970
Don't you know animals?

3011
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:03,390
Don't you know that turtles are slow and rabbits are fast?

3012
03:01:05,550 --> 03:01:06,590
Thank you for the superchat!

3013
03:01:06,650 --> 03:01:07,330
I don't know what it said.

3014
03:01:07,810 --> 03:01:09,590
I just see people responding to it.

3015
03:01:15,590 --> 03:01:15,950
Are

3016
03:01:21,060 --> 03:01:22,420
you gonna explode now?

3017
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:23,440
Yeah.

3018
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:26,600
And I'm just gonna keep on blasting, baby.

3019
03:01:32,420 --> 03:01:32,940
Oh no!

3020
03:02:01,740 --> 03:02:03,040
At least we got one.

3021
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:08,900
Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm being too passive.

3022
03:02:10,240 --> 03:02:12,060
And if I'm saying that, you know it's a problem.

3023
03:02:15,620 --> 03:02:17,680
I only remember how to avoid him.

3024
03:02:17,900 --> 03:02:19,560
I don't remember how to fight him.

3025
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:25,680
Oh shit.

3026
03:02:45,090 --> 03:02:46,130
Oh dang.

3027
03:02:46,650 --> 03:02:47,970
I thought I got out of the way.

3028
03:02:47,970 --> 03:02:48,090
Okay.

3029
03:02:56,380 --> 03:02:57,340
Oh no!

3030
03:02:58,020 --> 03:02:59,320
Oh my god, I can't get out.

3031
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:01,400
Screw it.

3032
03:03:01,580 --> 03:03:02,060
Screw it.

3033
03:03:04,020 --> 03:03:04,500
Dang

3034
03:03:15,280 --> 03:03:15,440
it.

3035
03:03:15,740 --> 03:03:16,740
Oh, that's so messed up.

3036
03:03:16,760 --> 03:03:17,640
I jumped out of the way.

3037
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:19,280
Come on.

3038
03:03:19,880 --> 03:03:20,800
Come on!

3039
03:03:21,160 --> 03:03:22,620
Alright, we're at phase three.

3040
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:24,580
Hurry.

3041
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:30,360
We have to save some DT for when he goes... Oh shit.

3042
03:03:31,880 --> 03:03:32,360
Shit.

3043
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:35,720
Dang it.

3044
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:37,300
Oh, that one always misses.

3045
03:03:37,360 --> 03:03:37,720
That's right.

3046
03:03:40,740 --> 03:03:41,220
What?!

3047
03:03:41,220 --> 03:03:41,700
Oh,

3048
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:47,060
double dash.

3049
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:47,480
Double dash.

3050
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:53,940
We were doing so hot until we were not.

3051
03:03:56,220 --> 03:03:58,740
We were doing so hot until we were not.

3052
03:04:01,240 --> 03:04:02,400
Oh gosh, double dash.

3053
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:02,680
Double dash.

3054
03:04:02,920 --> 03:04:06,140
I got cornered into a wall, guys.

3055
03:04:21,450 --> 03:04:21,810
Wait.

3056
03:04:21,890 --> 03:04:22,050
Wait!

3057
03:04:22,210 --> 03:04:22,210
Wait!

3058
03:04:22,310 --> 03:04:22,430
Wait!

3059
03:04:22,450 --> 03:04:22,650
Wait!

3060
03:04:22,650 --> 03:04:22,850
Wait!

3061
03:04:22,930 --> 03:04:22,930
Wait!

3062
03:04:31,380 --> 03:04:32,180
Oh okay.

3063
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:39,660
This is it.

3064
03:04:39,880 --> 03:04:40,560
This is it.

3065
03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:42,640
I can't even... It's not even letting me move.

3066
03:04:43,280 --> 03:04:44,340
It's not even letting me move.

3067
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:49,340
Am I still a trickster?

3068
03:04:49,440 --> 03:04:50,080
Yes, I am.

3069
03:04:50,140 --> 03:04:50,280
Okay.

3070
03:05:06,790 --> 03:05:07,470
Oh gosh.

3071
03:05:08,550 --> 03:05:09,750
Oh, I don't have enough DT.

3072
03:05:09,970 --> 03:05:10,470
This is it.

3073
03:05:20,870 --> 03:05:21,510
N.T.

3074
03:05:22,430 --> 03:05:23,210
N.T.

3075
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:32,920
The sword master move you have to use is sword throw, not stinger.

3076
03:05:34,600 --> 03:05:35,900
Oh, how do I do that again?

3077
03:05:38,660 --> 03:05:40,460
Oh, that is a thing I use, isn't it?

3078
03:05:41,140 --> 03:05:42,200
How do I do that again?

3079
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:45,740
Help me.

3080
03:05:45,960 --> 03:05:46,440
File.

3081
03:05:50,160 --> 03:05:51,420
Which is high time.

3082
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:53,320
Nope.

3083
03:05:54,560 --> 03:05:55,820
Not a million stabs.

3084
03:05:56,880 --> 03:05:58,460
RB forward A.

3085
03:06:04,220 --> 03:06:06,480
Oh, I was doing X.

3086
03:06:15,840 --> 03:06:18,400
Oh, it won't let me switch.

3087
03:06:18,780 --> 03:06:20,980
What's so annoying is it won't let me switch modes in here.

3088
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:23,080
It won't let me do anything.

3089
03:06:24,100 --> 03:06:25,700
So if I want to practice, I can't.

3090
03:06:26,660 --> 03:06:29,880
They're like, no, you can't try it in here, you guys.

3091
03:06:33,240 --> 03:06:35,420
It's like, no, you're good enough, I guess.

3092
03:06:35,500 --> 03:06:36,960
She's the tortoise that's approaching.

3093
03:06:37,260 --> 03:06:37,620
Approaching.

3094
03:06:37,800 --> 03:06:38,900
She's still approaching.

3095
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:42,920
Yeah, if I try to...

3096
03:06:42,920 --> 03:06:43,620
There

3097
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:48,320
you go.

3098
03:06:48,560 --> 03:06:50,720
For everybody who needs the foolproof.

3099
03:06:52,120 --> 03:06:52,560
Trickster.

3100
03:06:57,820 --> 03:06:59,200
Oh, that was not good.

3101
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:01,880
I overestimated a little bit.

3102
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:08,280
Oh, oh, I'm not feeling it.

3103
03:07:08,560 --> 03:07:10,080
I'm not feeling it, you guys.

3104
03:07:10,160 --> 03:07:11,320
I'm not feeling it this round.

3105
03:07:11,460 --> 03:07:12,100
Oh, no.

3106
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:13,640
Oh, I know.

3107
03:07:14,760 --> 03:07:15,520
Oh, I know.

3108
03:07:16,460 --> 03:07:17,280
Oh, I know.

3109
03:07:17,980 --> 03:07:18,540
Oh, I know.

3110
03:07:18,680 --> 03:07:19,020
Oh, I know.

3111
03:07:21,740 --> 03:07:22,400
Hold on.

3112
03:07:22,660 --> 03:07:24,500
I must time you out.

3113
03:07:24,900 --> 03:07:25,220
Sorry.

3114
03:07:25,460 --> 03:07:28,320
Don't tell me to be aggressive when I literally told you this is how I play.

3115
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:29,580
Sorry, guys.

3116
03:07:29,640 --> 03:07:30,800
I'm kind of spicy today.

3117
03:07:30,920 --> 03:07:31,920
I don't know what's wrong with me.

3118
03:07:31,980 --> 03:07:33,620
I think I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

3119
03:07:43,740 --> 03:07:45,880
It's like, how about you play in my style?

3120
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:47,680
How about you play the game that I play?

3121
03:07:54,530 --> 03:07:55,150
Okie dokie.

3122
03:08:00,260 --> 03:08:01,860
I'm not usually this spicy, though.

3123
03:08:01,920 --> 03:08:03,240
I don't know what's wrong with me today.

3124
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:09,860
It's not like anything bad happened.

3125
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:11,440
I'm just feeling a little spicy.

3126
03:08:12,720 --> 03:08:13,560
Oh, shoot.

3127
03:08:22,120 --> 03:08:24,780
I did not realize I was against a wall.

3128
03:08:25,080 --> 03:08:26,940
Oh, this one is going so bad.

3129
03:08:28,160 --> 03:08:30,220
No, this one is going so bad.

3130
03:08:32,880 --> 03:08:35,860
I hate when it moves the camera like that.

3131
03:08:37,340 --> 03:08:38,360
I hate it.

3132
03:08:50,350 --> 03:08:52,170
No, it was even before Nevin.

3133
03:08:52,410 --> 03:08:53,010
I don't know.

3134
03:08:53,250 --> 03:08:56,250
Like, just today, I was like, oh my god, get me out of here.

3135
03:08:57,050 --> 03:09:01,390
Even today, just like, I was just kind of grumpy working on stuff.

3136
03:09:03,470 --> 03:09:06,030
I considered not streaming, but I thought I would be okay.

3137
03:09:06,790 --> 03:09:07,490
So, I apologize.

3138
03:09:28,110 --> 03:09:30,350
Oh my god, it doesn't help if I...

3139
03:09:31,730 --> 03:09:35,130
If I try to be aggressive and I can't even land a hit.

3140
03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:45,220
Is that phase two?

3141
03:09:59,560 --> 03:10:01,040
This one goes up.

3142
03:10:05,400 --> 03:10:06,040
Got it.

3143
03:10:06,120 --> 03:10:06,920
Oh, and my sword back.

3144
03:10:10,700 --> 03:10:11,460
Trickster, please.

3145
03:10:11,460 --> 03:10:11,540
Please.

3146
03:10:12,800 --> 03:10:16,440
I lost a lot of health just now.

3147
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:20,020
No, screw it.

3148
03:10:20,620 --> 03:10:21,400
Screw it.

3149
03:10:26,240 --> 03:10:27,820
Eat it.

3150
03:10:39,800 --> 03:10:40,940
Goddamn.

3151
03:10:40,940 --> 03:10:41,020
Damn.

3152
03:10:46,140 --> 03:10:48,000
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, the camera.

3153
03:10:48,280 --> 03:10:49,860
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, camera.

3154
03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:51,960
Oh my god, oh my god, camera.

3155
03:10:54,120 --> 03:10:57,140
Oh, whoops, that's not what I meant to do, but it's okay.

3156
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:04,470
I pressed jump, I did.

3157
03:11:05,490 --> 03:11:06,870
I pressed jump, I did.

3158
03:11:07,810 --> 03:11:08,930
I can't see anything.

3159
03:11:17,800 --> 03:11:19,760
I need to really...

3160
03:11:33,100 --> 03:11:34,580
Okay, I need to have enough.

3161
03:11:35,700 --> 03:11:37,620
Okay, alright, we have enough DT.

3162
03:11:38,100 --> 03:11:41,140
Just in case he decides to go crazy.

3163
03:11:41,640 --> 03:11:41,780
Wait.

3164
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:47,300
Nice.

3165
03:11:48,980 --> 03:11:50,120
This one goes up.

3166
03:11:53,460 --> 03:11:54,120
Nice.

3167
03:11:54,720 --> 03:11:56,460
And I'll take that.

3168
03:11:57,800 --> 03:11:58,460
DT!

3169
03:11:59,140 --> 03:11:59,500
Oh!

3170
03:12:00,880 --> 03:12:01,840
Oh my god.

3171
03:12:02,920 --> 03:12:03,820
Grab the dwarves!

3172
03:12:04,520 --> 03:12:05,500
Oh my god.

3173
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:20,920
Okay, alright.

3174
03:12:37,280 --> 03:12:38,270
One, two...

3175
03:12:38,600 --> 03:12:40,300
Oh, okay, nevermind.

3176
03:12:41,200 --> 03:12:42,360
You went off script.

3177
03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:43,660
That's fine.

3178
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:46,460
Oh my god, please.

3179
03:12:47,160 --> 03:12:48,420
Oh, I don't have enough.

3180
03:12:48,820 --> 03:12:50,040
Oh no, no!

3181
03:12:51,680 --> 03:12:52,080
No!

3182
03:12:52,840 --> 03:12:53,680
You bastard.

3183
03:12:59,560 --> 03:13:01,820
Oh come on, you just did that move!

3184
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:03,500
You just did that move!

3185
03:13:03,940 --> 03:13:04,960
You just did that!

3186
03:13:05,260 --> 03:13:05,880
You can't!

3187
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:06,420
You cheater!

3188
03:13:09,560 --> 03:13:10,540
You cheater!

3189
03:13:10,880 --> 03:13:13,520
Oh my god, please.

3190
03:13:15,620 --> 03:13:16,780
That's so cheating!

3191
03:13:17,060 --> 03:13:18,020
Why isn't there a cooldown?

3192
03:13:24,620 --> 03:13:25,380
Oh my god.

3193
03:13:27,040 --> 03:13:29,160
I thought he was gonna do the leap.

3194
03:13:29,220 --> 03:13:30,420
He's not consistent.

3195
03:13:30,420 --> 03:13:34,640
I think that's what is so annoying about this fight, is he's so inconsistent.

3196
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:37,580
He doesn't like, run, run, jump, run, run, jump, run, run, jump.

3197
03:13:37,640 --> 03:13:39,520
You know, he's like, sometimes he's like, run, jump.

3198
03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:40,860
Sometimes he's run, run, run.

3199
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:42,240
Sometimes he's run, jump, jump.

3200
03:13:42,400 --> 03:13:43,820
Like, he's just so annoying!

3201
03:13:51,670 --> 03:13:54,430
He saw you spamming range and said, that's a good idea.

3202
03:13:55,270 --> 03:13:58,290
Except my range doesn't do as much damage as his.

3203
03:14:05,270 --> 03:14:06,110
Oh gosh.

3204
03:14:06,270 --> 03:14:08,790
I don't think he shoots the feathers when you're too far.

3205
03:14:08,890 --> 03:14:12,570
Because I was very close to him when he shot it the second time.

3206
03:14:13,670 --> 03:14:16,530
When he shot it the second time and was spamming.

3207
03:14:20,370 --> 03:14:21,990
I don't know guys, how are we feeling?

3208
03:14:24,190 --> 03:14:27,270
I think I might try the tongue again.

3209
03:14:27,510 --> 03:14:28,770
Or whatever the hell that was.

3210
03:14:28,890 --> 03:14:29,550
The esophagus.

3211
03:14:33,670 --> 03:14:34,190
Oh...

3212
03:14:43,880 --> 03:14:45,720
It's sword master, right?

3213
03:14:59,370 --> 03:15:00,570
Or maybe not.

3214
03:15:00,830 --> 03:15:01,490
What was it?

3215
03:15:05,910 --> 03:15:07,170
Oh, we got it.

3216
03:15:21,990 --> 03:15:24,850
I don't remember the music being kinda cool like this.

3217
03:15:26,870 --> 03:15:28,710
Isn't he gonna launch a laser?

3218
03:15:29,970 --> 03:15:30,450
No?

3219
03:15:31,370 --> 03:15:32,170
Where's the laser?

3220
03:15:32,710 --> 03:15:35,430
Oh, here

3221
03:15:48,420 --> 03:15:48,720
it is.

3222
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:49,300
Here's the laser!

3223
03:15:54,780 --> 03:15:55,840
You know what, screw it.

3224
03:16:02,630 --> 03:16:04,670
It's so gross!

3225
03:16:08,570 --> 03:16:10,150
What do I do with these?

3226
03:16:15,470 --> 03:16:17,270
Maybe I don't need to switch.

3227
03:16:20,330 --> 03:16:23,270
I tried to parry them, but I don't think it worked.

3228
03:16:24,870 --> 03:16:25,430
Hello!

3229
03:16:26,510 --> 03:16:27,510
No, this guy.

3230
03:16:29,390 --> 03:16:30,510
Oh, laser!

3231
03:16:31,210 --> 03:16:31,770
Oh, laser!

3232
03:16:32,090 --> 03:16:33,730
Oh my god, can you give me a...

3233
03:16:33,730 --> 03:16:35,810
I hate this game so much.

3234
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:38,790
It doesn't give me any chance to react.

3235
03:16:39,350 --> 03:16:40,610
Like it doesn't let me...

3236
03:16:41,170 --> 03:16:44,190
Oh my god, it doesn't let me...

3237
03:16:44,190 --> 03:16:46,350
Fucking hell, it doesn't...

3238
03:16:46,350 --> 03:16:47,990
I'm like stuck in a corner.

3239
03:16:47,990 --> 03:16:50,410
And it doesn't let me do anything.

3240
03:16:54,630 --> 03:16:56,210
Oh my god.

3241
03:16:59,130 --> 03:16:59,990
Hey, chill.

3242
03:17:01,590 --> 03:17:02,570
Oh, no, not you.

3243
03:17:02,930 --> 03:17:03,810
Can you...

3244
03:17:03,810 --> 03:17:05,150
I don't care about you guys.

3245
03:17:08,330 --> 03:17:09,630
I'm dead, I'm dead.

3246
03:17:11,430 --> 03:17:11,930
Ah!

3247
03:17:18,430 --> 03:17:19,370
She's crashing out?

3248
03:17:19,430 --> 03:17:20,330
I've been crashing out.

3249
03:17:20,510 --> 03:17:22,430
I literally just ended up having a bad day.

3250
03:17:30,790 --> 03:17:35,610
We got so much closer with this one, so I think I'm just gonna go with this.

3251
03:17:36,010 --> 03:17:36,510
Honestly.

3252
03:17:37,570 --> 03:17:37,890
Alright.

3253
03:17:37,890 --> 03:17:40,410
Are you gonna do... Oh, no.

3254
03:17:46,400 --> 03:17:47,420
Big damage.

3255
03:17:51,890 --> 03:17:53,410
When are you gonna do the laser?

3256
03:17:56,270 --> 03:17:57,610
Not... Not yet.

3257
03:17:58,050 --> 03:18:00,030
Okay, I have to be attacking this thing again?

3258
03:18:00,390 --> 03:18:02,730
And then you'll be like, oh, I'm getting attacked.

3259
03:18:03,530 --> 03:18:04,790
Might as well do the laser.

3260
03:18:05,410 --> 03:18:06,730
No, okay, no laser.

3261
03:18:09,530 --> 03:18:11,030
I'm trying to pay attention.

3262
03:18:11,590 --> 03:18:12,650
To do the laser.

3263
03:18:14,470 --> 03:18:15,510
Can you guys leave me alone?

3264
03:18:15,630 --> 03:18:16,410
Oh, here he comes.

3265
03:18:32,570 --> 03:18:35,370
Oh, man, we didn't get a lot of DT that time.

3266
03:18:39,610 --> 03:18:39,990
Okay.

3267
03:18:41,070 --> 03:18:42,490
Alright, come back, you.

3268
03:18:43,710 --> 03:18:44,470
Mr. Squishy.

3269
03:18:45,310 --> 03:18:46,570
It's so disgusting.

3270
03:18:48,510 --> 03:18:49,910
What was the...

3271
03:18:49,910 --> 03:18:50,510
Gosh.

3272
03:18:51,090 --> 03:18:52,070
Maybe it was trickster?

3273
03:18:54,570 --> 03:18:54,950
Or...

3274
03:18:54,950 --> 03:18:55,490
Oh my god.

3275
03:18:55,590 --> 03:18:56,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

3276
03:18:56,630 --> 03:18:58,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

3277
03:18:59,310 --> 03:18:59,630
Wait!

3278
03:19:14,100 --> 03:19:15,220
Sword bastard.

3279
03:19:16,600 --> 03:19:18,320
Oh, and yeah.

3280
03:19:18,860 --> 03:19:19,960
Two on this.

3281
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:20,980
And, oh.

3282
03:19:21,860 --> 03:19:23,360
Not good, not good, not good.

3283
03:19:23,780 --> 03:19:24,800
Leave me alone!

3284
03:19:25,260 --> 03:19:27,180
Leave me alone, you stupid skellies!

3285
03:19:27,220 --> 03:19:28,160
Whatever the hell you are.

3286
03:19:28,980 --> 03:19:30,680
You stomach parasites.

3287
03:19:45,430 --> 03:19:48,210
Alright, let's go fight the Grim Reaper again.

3288
03:19:49,590 --> 03:19:52,830
Let's go fight the Grim Reaper...

3289
03:19:53,450 --> 03:19:53,930
Again!

3290
03:19:57,310 --> 03:19:59,190
That one was so much faster than Beowulf.

3291
03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:04,560
Okay.

3292
03:20:07,360 --> 03:20:08,440
The orange one, right?

3293
03:20:08,500 --> 03:20:09,020
Is the Grim Reaper?

3294
03:20:10,520 --> 03:20:11,740
Oh, that's the horse.

3295
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:13,800
I get so lost in here.

3296
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:18,900
The devil has awakened in me.

3297
03:20:19,360 --> 03:20:20,600
Today I'm not a ghost.

3298
03:20:20,800 --> 03:20:21,800
Today I'm a demon.

3299
03:20:25,800 --> 03:20:27,180
Lucky, lucky.

3300
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:29,540
Next to the horse.

3301
03:20:30,060 --> 03:20:31,240
But like, down here.

3302
03:20:31,740 --> 03:20:32,220
Right?

3303
03:20:32,600 --> 03:20:33,560
Or am I crazy?

3304
03:20:34,500 --> 03:20:35,180
Up here?

3305
03:20:35,800 --> 03:20:37,420
I can't remember.

3306
03:20:42,120 --> 03:20:45,220
This is me.

3307
03:20:48,160 --> 03:20:49,120
Here?

3308
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:49,380
Here?

3309
03:20:54,560 --> 03:20:55,600
Here?

3310
03:20:58,700 --> 03:21:00,560
Next to the horse.

3311
03:21:00,960 --> 03:21:01,720
Not here?

3312
03:21:03,960 --> 03:21:04,640
Here?

3313
03:21:05,840 --> 03:21:06,880
Here!

3314
03:21:10,360 --> 03:21:12,240
Oh my god.

3315
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,660
I can't believe we are back here!

3316
03:21:16,260 --> 03:21:16,940
Wow!

3317
03:21:16,940 --> 03:21:17,060
Wow!

3318
03:21:21,700 --> 03:21:23,020
Oh my god.

3319
03:21:26,350 --> 03:21:28,790
We have everything we have now though.

3320
03:21:29,170 --> 03:21:30,270
We have...

3321
03:21:31,170 --> 03:21:33,810
We have everything we have now though.

3322
03:21:34,670 --> 03:21:36,570
We are stronger now.

3323
03:21:39,450 --> 03:21:41,690
We are back at this level, but we are different!

3324
03:21:42,370 --> 03:21:43,230
We are better!

3325
03:21:43,390 --> 03:21:44,170
We are stronger!

3326
03:21:44,170 --> 03:21:44,410
We are stronger!

3327
03:21:50,330 --> 03:21:51,490
Oh, here it is.

3328
03:21:53,950 --> 03:21:55,890
Oh my god, it's here.

3329
03:22:01,040 --> 03:22:02,880
Oh, that didn't parry at all.

3330
03:22:12,990 --> 03:22:13,950
Oh, where'd you go?

3331
03:22:14,070 --> 03:22:14,350
Where'd you go?

3332
03:22:18,590 --> 03:22:19,330
Come here.

3333
03:22:19,330 --> 03:22:20,190
Yeah!

3334
03:22:20,430 --> 03:22:20,630
Yeah!

3335
03:22:20,970 --> 03:22:21,330
Yeah!

3336
03:22:24,040 --> 03:22:25,510
Oh shoot, I stopped.

3337
03:22:25,590 --> 03:22:26,690
I stopped attacking.

3338
03:22:29,670 --> 03:22:30,290
Parry!

3339
03:22:32,230 --> 03:22:33,210
Parry the platypus!

3340
03:22:39,930 --> 03:22:41,120
Just keep going.

3341
03:22:42,040 --> 03:22:42,720
Don't stop.

3342
03:22:53,380 --> 03:22:54,240
He's almost dead.

3343
03:22:56,720 --> 03:22:57,340
Sweet!

3344
03:22:57,340 --> 03:22:57,960
Showtime!

3345
03:22:58,140 --> 03:22:59,160
Oh my god, I got...

3346
03:23:03,420 --> 03:23:03,820
Oh

3347
03:23:08,550 --> 03:23:09,970
gosh, I keep trying to get out of the way.

3348
03:23:10,230 --> 03:23:10,830
I'm so bad.

3349
03:23:11,790 --> 03:23:12,550
Oh, here we go.

3350
03:23:12,790 --> 03:23:13,190
Devil trigger.

3351
03:23:14,410 --> 03:23:16,950
And then when I can attack him...

3352
03:23:18,430 --> 03:23:19,350
Oh, so close!

3353
03:23:19,390 --> 03:23:19,690
One more!

3354
03:23:20,430 --> 03:23:21,170
There we go!

3355
03:23:23,470 --> 03:23:23,870
Wow!

3356
03:23:24,150 --> 03:23:24,470
Yippee!

3357
03:23:24,850 --> 03:23:25,870
Oh, there's more.

3358
03:23:26,050 --> 03:23:26,370
Just kidding.

3359
03:23:28,870 --> 03:23:29,910
Yippee for two seconds!

3360
03:23:42,220 --> 03:23:43,220
Everybody get stinger!

3361
03:23:43,420 --> 03:23:44,200
You get stinger!

3362
03:23:44,360 --> 03:23:44,700
You get...

3363
03:23:44,700 --> 03:23:46,100
You get stinger!

3364
03:23:46,280 --> 03:23:47,000
You get stinger!

3365
03:23:48,140 --> 03:23:48,460
Again?

3366
03:23:50,840 --> 03:23:52,660
Was he there a second time before?

3367
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:54,700
No, right?

3368
03:23:54,900 --> 03:23:55,860
I don't actually remember.

3369
03:23:57,060 --> 03:23:58,720
It's been like three years.

3370
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:01,160
Oops, that's not what I meant to do.

3371
03:24:02,420 --> 03:24:02,620
No!

3372
03:24:11,750 --> 03:24:13,730
Oh god, I might die for real then.

3373
03:24:16,330 --> 03:24:17,130
Oh shit.

3374
03:24:18,490 --> 03:24:19,630
That's not what I meant to do.

3375
03:24:24,770 --> 03:24:26,090
Please give me some grub!

3376
03:24:38,390 --> 03:24:39,090
Oh shit!

3377
03:24:40,290 --> 03:24:43,330
I switched to sword master instead of jigsaw.

3378
03:24:45,230 --> 03:24:47,470
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna make it, you guys.

3379
03:24:47,730 --> 03:24:48,990
I don't think I'm gonna make it!

3380
03:24:51,710 --> 03:24:53,350
Oh my god!

3381
03:24:53,510 --> 03:24:54,430
Oh my god!

3382
03:24:55,690 --> 03:24:57,450
Well, we have to.

3383
03:24:57,610 --> 03:24:59,030
We have to do it.

3384
03:24:59,270 --> 03:25:00,810
We've settled on this path.

3385
03:25:04,250 --> 03:25:05,790
We've settled on this path.

3386
03:25:14,040 --> 03:25:17,160
I'm not gonna use a new... I'm not gonna use Nevin because...

3387
03:25:18,340 --> 03:25:21,320
I don't think this is a good time for me to learn a new weapon.

3388
03:25:22,740 --> 03:25:25,880
Considering I never used it before.

3389
03:25:26,520 --> 03:25:31,880
If I had been training with it this time, then I think it'd be different, but...

3390
03:25:36,970 --> 03:25:39,610
Why didn't you give me any grub, you cheap...

3391
03:25:39,610 --> 03:25:40,610
You cheapos!

3392
03:25:40,750 --> 03:25:41,530
You're so cheap!

3393
03:25:41,610 --> 03:25:42,110
You're all cheap!

3394
03:25:42,250 --> 03:25:43,330
Cheep cheep cheep cheep!

3395
03:25:53,430 --> 03:25:54,950
And he's here!

3396
03:25:55,610 --> 03:25:56,950
And he's here!

3397
03:25:57,190 --> 03:25:57,850
And he's here!

3398
03:25:58,490 --> 03:25:59,250
Oh my goodness.

3399
03:25:59,350 --> 03:25:59,550
Ow!

3400
03:26:01,370 --> 03:26:01,770
Okay.

3401
03:26:05,750 --> 03:26:06,690
Oh, he's not down?

3402
03:26:06,830 --> 03:26:07,190
Oh my god.

3403
03:26:08,170 --> 03:26:08,630
Oh my god!

3404
03:26:22,560 --> 03:26:23,200
Ah, shoot.

3405
03:26:43,840 --> 03:26:46,040
What's the point if I can't even dodge correctly?

3406
03:26:52,720 --> 03:26:54,780
I always just go the wrong way.

3407
03:26:54,900 --> 03:26:56,440
I never can get it correctly.

3408
03:26:59,800 --> 03:27:04,060
I never can predict which way he's gonna be at.

3409
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:05,100
What's the point?

3410
03:27:06,760 --> 03:27:07,440
What's the point?

3411
03:27:24,100 --> 03:27:24,980
Oh, shoot.

3412
03:27:36,320 --> 03:27:37,000
Okay.

3413
03:27:37,660 --> 03:27:39,100
Actually, I'm gonna save this.

3414
03:27:43,110 --> 03:27:44,310
Well, we'll get more.

3415
03:27:44,850 --> 03:27:47,810
No, I'm gonna save it since I think he... Oh, shoot.

3416
03:27:48,490 --> 03:27:48,990
Actually, no.

3417
03:27:49,090 --> 03:27:49,390
Never mind.

3418
03:27:49,710 --> 03:27:50,470
I can change my mind.

3419
03:27:53,650 --> 03:27:54,990
I changed my mind.

3420
03:27:57,510 --> 03:27:58,350
Oh, he's back?

3421
03:27:58,530 --> 03:27:58,750
Okay.

3422
03:27:59,630 --> 03:28:00,350
Oh, shit.

3423
03:28:00,870 --> 03:28:01,070
Okay.

3424
03:28:05,460 --> 03:28:05,680
No!

3425
03:28:06,020 --> 03:28:06,280
No!

3426
03:28:06,600 --> 03:28:07,580
Oh, shit.

3427
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:16,080
Everyone's against me!

3428
03:28:16,980 --> 03:28:23,320
Oh, my trauma of having to redo this freaking battle so many times.

3429
03:28:36,230 --> 03:28:37,230
Oh, shoot.

3430
03:28:37,490 --> 03:28:38,010
No.

3431
03:28:38,810 --> 03:28:39,050
No.

3432
03:28:40,250 --> 03:28:41,270
Oh my god.

3433
03:28:41,850 --> 03:28:42,190
Please.

3434
03:29:01,090 --> 03:29:02,730
Oh my god.

3435
03:29:02,810 --> 03:29:03,290
Oh my god.

3436
03:29:25,220 --> 03:29:25,320
Hmm?

3437
03:30:30,690 --> 03:30:32,130
I'm strategizing in my brain.

3438
03:30:34,010 --> 03:30:35,450
I'm strategizing in my brain.

3439
03:30:36,030 --> 03:30:38,970
I'm trying to remember what I need to click before I go into the battle.

3440
03:30:43,750 --> 03:30:45,710
I'm not reading chat, but thank you.

3441
03:30:45,870 --> 03:30:46,890
Well, I am now.

3442
03:30:46,890 --> 03:30:47,070
Well...

3443
03:30:50,270 --> 03:30:52,210
Yeah, you get a time out for that.

3444
03:30:52,290 --> 03:30:53,490
For telling me what to do!

3445
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:11,240
Don't say this will be the run!

3446
03:31:11,560 --> 03:31:12,620
That always jinxes me.

3447
03:31:30,680 --> 03:31:32,460
Oh god, there's so many of them.

3448
03:31:34,920 --> 03:31:35,320
No.

3449
03:31:35,320 --> 03:31:36,020
Yeah!

3450
03:31:36,500 --> 03:31:36,900
Yeah!

3451
03:31:51,740 --> 03:31:55,640
The music is so awesome and scary at the same time!

3452
03:31:58,920 --> 03:32:00,500
I'm trying to get rid of this guy.

3453
03:32:00,860 --> 03:32:01,900
Just so I can get him gone.

3454
03:32:06,060 --> 03:32:06,460
Okay.

3455
03:32:07,560 --> 03:32:08,560
Die already!

3456
03:32:12,130 --> 03:32:12,690
Oh, shoot.

3457
03:32:13,030 --> 03:32:13,290
Okay.

3458
03:32:13,290 --> 03:32:13,350
Okay.

3459
03:32:23,740 --> 03:32:29,000
I think sword master might be... Well, at least if I have my air hike.

3460
03:32:29,700 --> 03:32:31,000
I was gonna try and...

3461
03:32:35,700 --> 03:32:36,380
Oh, shoot.

3462
03:32:39,480 --> 03:32:40,420
Oh my god.

3463
03:32:53,720 --> 03:32:54,480
Oh, shit.

3464
03:33:01,790 --> 03:33:02,770
The stinger.

3465
03:33:03,270 --> 03:33:04,350
Stinger, my beloved!

3466
03:33:07,410 --> 03:33:07,930
Jump!

3467
03:33:07,970 --> 03:33:08,730
Jump out of the way.

3468
03:33:10,430 --> 03:33:12,770
Oh my god, I thought I would get you.

3469
03:33:15,010 --> 03:33:16,750
Oh, not doing so hot.

3470
03:33:17,750 --> 03:33:19,490
Not doing so hot, guys.

3471
03:33:34,370 --> 03:33:35,610
Get his ass!

3472
03:33:39,790 --> 03:33:45,250
I can't tell if the mobs keep spawning or if I'm just not getting them fast enough before the other guy comes in, you know what I mean?

3473
03:33:45,810 --> 03:33:47,130
Oh god, he's already here!

3474
03:33:48,390 --> 03:33:50,850
Oh no, they're definitely... Wait, actually I can't tell.

3475
03:33:52,610 --> 03:33:53,230
Oh my god.

3476
03:34:10,680 --> 03:34:13,600
Maybe they're not respawning.

3477
03:34:13,680 --> 03:34:14,180
Oh, they are.

3478
03:34:14,900 --> 03:34:16,220
Or there's at least new guys.

3479
03:34:16,320 --> 03:34:16,900
There's new guys.

3480
03:34:17,020 --> 03:34:17,640
Okay, okay.

3481
03:34:18,200 --> 03:34:21,080
So we need to focus our efforts...

3482
03:34:21,080 --> 03:34:21,640
Oh, shit.

3483
03:34:23,540 --> 03:34:25,100
On... this guy.

3484
03:34:34,020 --> 03:34:34,320
No!

3485
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:35,640
I got in my way!

3486
03:34:36,220 --> 03:34:37,580
Oh my god!

3487
03:34:37,680 --> 03:34:39,800
Please, camera, I can't see!

3488
03:34:40,440 --> 03:34:41,040
Please!

3489
03:34:46,740 --> 03:34:47,340
Jump!

3490
03:34:47,820 --> 03:34:49,560
I tried to jump out of the way.

3491
03:34:50,160 --> 03:34:54,120
Sometimes it works and sometimes... Oh my god, it doesn't.

3492
03:35:01,580 --> 03:35:02,680
Oh my god, please.

3493
03:35:04,660 --> 03:35:05,100
No!

3494
03:35:05,540 --> 03:35:06,840
I have to pee so bad!

3495
03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:09,720
Where are you?

3496
03:35:09,780 --> 03:35:10,880
Oh, there you are.

3497
03:35:12,480 --> 03:35:12,920
Oh,

3498
03:35:27,020 --> 03:35:27,020
shit.

3499
03:35:59,340 --> 03:36:00,120
Come on!

3500
03:36:00,220 --> 03:36:00,740
Come on!

3501
03:36:05,080 --> 03:36:06,260
I got his ass.

3502
03:36:07,480 --> 03:36:09,060
Oh, we still have to fight you guys?

3503
03:36:09,160 --> 03:36:09,400
Okay.

3504
03:36:09,580 --> 03:36:10,400
Okay, that's so fair.

3505
03:36:12,540 --> 03:36:12,980
Sure.

3506
03:36:12,980 --> 03:36:13,420
Sure.

3507
03:36:14,060 --> 03:36:14,500
Whatever.

3508
03:36:14,500 --> 03:36:14,680
Whatever.

3509
03:36:17,240 --> 03:36:18,220
Okay.

3510
03:36:18,660 --> 03:36:18,940
Yeah!

3511
03:36:20,330 --> 03:36:22,840
Alright, it was the strut instead.

3512
03:36:30,240 --> 03:36:32,900
That was the strut instead.

3513
03:36:34,220 --> 03:36:36,440
Oh my god.

3514
03:36:38,460 --> 03:36:39,680
Get me out of here.

3515
03:36:46,180 --> 03:36:47,160
Bald.

3516
03:36:50,970 --> 03:36:52,710
Trying to compensate for something?

3517
03:37:02,390 --> 03:37:04,670
That should be my sword!

3518
03:37:10,200 --> 03:37:11,920
He's like, I ain't studying the blade.

3519
03:37:18,520 --> 03:37:19,340
Oh no!

3520
03:37:20,480 --> 03:37:22,220
Wait, does he actually get Sparda's armor?

3521
03:37:22,740 --> 03:37:23,440
Oh my god.

3522
03:37:25,940 --> 03:37:27,080
No way!

3523
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:28,140
Oh no.

3524
03:37:29,480 --> 03:37:30,540
Oh no!

3525
03:37:37,620 --> 03:37:38,760
Sparda cosplay.

3526
03:37:38,940 --> 03:37:40,060
How long did this take us?

3527
03:37:40,100 --> 03:37:40,500
Let's see.

3528
03:37:42,080 --> 03:37:43,280
Two hours.

3529
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:48,080
Holy hell.

3530
03:37:53,680 --> 03:37:55,160
Yeah, I gotta go to the bathroom.

3531
03:37:56,380 --> 03:37:57,280
Oh my god.

3532
03:37:58,580 --> 03:37:59,540
What's that?

3533
03:37:59,600 --> 03:38:03,440
Now we have two missions left.

3534
03:38:05,520 --> 03:38:07,100
Two left, I think.

3535
03:38:17,580 --> 03:38:19,140
B for bad level.

3536
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:21,260
That's what I say.

3537
03:38:21,960 --> 03:38:24,240
Oh, he's just casually walking by her.

3538
03:38:24,620 --> 03:38:24,960
Wait!

3539
03:38:25,580 --> 03:38:26,860
Wake up lady!

3540
03:38:27,320 --> 03:38:28,680
She's right there!

3541
03:38:29,280 --> 03:38:31,000
Too bad you gave away your gun.

3542
03:38:32,920 --> 03:38:36,580
He has to use doors just like all normal people too.

3543
03:38:37,520 --> 03:38:39,140
Sparda is like you and me.

3544
03:38:40,040 --> 03:38:41,720
He also uses doors.

3545
03:38:44,700 --> 03:38:46,120
Ok, I gotta go pee so bad.

3546
03:38:46,220 --> 03:38:46,940
Hold on, I'll be right back.

3547
03:40:59,450 --> 03:41:00,630
Okie dokie, I'm back.

3548
03:41:02,090 --> 03:41:03,130
Mission 19.

3549
03:41:03,370 --> 03:41:04,290
Forces collide.

3550
03:41:04,490 --> 03:41:06,350
Topple the great beast with Faith's bullet.

3551
03:41:12,930 --> 03:41:14,470
Oh my god.

3552
03:41:14,570 --> 03:41:16,130
Welcome back, thank you!

3553
03:41:22,170 --> 03:41:23,650
Oh, these guys again.

3554
03:41:25,110 --> 03:41:27,330
Oh, ok, thanks for the warning.

3555
03:41:28,690 --> 03:41:30,830
Oh wait, no, no, there we go.

3556
03:41:36,150 --> 03:41:38,750
You guys are flames.

3557
03:41:38,750 --> 03:41:40,850
So I use ice.

3558
03:41:41,690 --> 03:41:43,950
Oh, I'm like sword master?

3559
03:41:47,010 --> 03:41:48,190
Chew on this!

3560
03:41:49,550 --> 03:41:50,850
Oh, oops.

3561
03:41:51,590 --> 03:41:52,890
Almost had a null.

3562
03:41:54,710 --> 03:41:56,110
Wait, can I have my robes?

3563
03:41:56,170 --> 03:41:56,470
Thank you.

3564
03:42:09,260 --> 03:42:10,500
It's cute!

3565
03:42:20,680 --> 03:42:21,800
Chew on this.

3566
03:42:25,660 --> 03:42:26,300
Nice.

3567
03:42:26,880 --> 03:42:27,920
It's cute!

3568
03:42:31,200 --> 03:42:33,780
Do I go in the mirror now, again?

3569
03:42:35,420 --> 03:42:36,780
Anything hidden in here?

3570
03:42:39,420 --> 03:42:42,240
Wait, are more things spawning?

3571
03:42:43,320 --> 03:42:43,600
No.

3572
03:42:43,940 --> 03:42:45,040
Wait, what did I just hear?

3573
03:42:48,600 --> 03:42:51,720
I'm like hearing things moaning and groaning.

3574
03:42:54,920 --> 03:42:56,960
Oh, it's just part of the ambiance.

3575
03:42:57,540 --> 03:42:58,980
This place is so freaky!

3576
03:42:59,780 --> 03:43:02,000
Wow, look at the tombstone.

3577
03:43:02,600 --> 03:43:04,500
Could be yours, could be mine.

3578
03:43:14,240 --> 03:43:16,780
Oh, again?

3579
03:43:19,890 --> 03:43:20,370
Oh, ok.

3580
03:43:28,150 --> 03:43:29,910
Am I not hitting them?

3581
03:43:31,350 --> 03:43:32,790
Am I not doing any damage?

3582
03:44:12,520 --> 03:44:13,780
Oh my god.

3583
03:44:14,620 --> 03:44:16,680
Hold on, I'm just trying to...

3584
03:44:16,680 --> 03:44:17,520
What the hell?

3585
03:44:18,460 --> 03:44:19,860
I can't tell if I'm doing this right.

3586
03:44:19,960 --> 03:44:21,660
I'm just trying, I guess.

3587
03:44:23,120 --> 03:44:23,560
Stop!

3588
03:44:28,980 --> 03:44:29,540
Oh!

3589
03:44:31,260 --> 03:44:32,260
Oh, we got him.

3590
03:44:32,420 --> 03:44:32,800
Nice.

3591
03:44:35,340 --> 03:44:35,900
Ish.

3592
03:44:36,200 --> 03:44:36,460
Wait.

3593
03:44:37,200 --> 03:44:37,660
Oh no.

3594
03:44:38,260 --> 03:44:39,220
We had them.

3595
03:44:39,540 --> 03:44:40,020
Oh no.

3596
03:44:40,860 --> 03:44:42,240
Oh, there's an even freakier guy.

3597
03:44:42,900 --> 03:44:44,060
Even freakier guy.

3598
03:44:48,900 --> 03:44:50,020
This one.

3599
03:44:56,600 --> 03:44:57,360
I'm looking.

3600
03:44:57,600 --> 03:44:58,060
Oh, here it is.

3601
03:44:59,000 --> 03:44:59,880
Oh my god.

3602
03:45:03,280 --> 03:45:05,680
Oh, my brain is starting to...

3603
03:45:05,680 --> 03:45:06,300
What the hell?

3604
03:45:06,380 --> 03:45:08,300
Every time I get close to it...

3605
03:45:08,300 --> 03:45:09,160
Oh, there we go.

3606
03:45:13,920 --> 03:45:16,080
I'm gonna die at this rate.

3607
03:45:18,660 --> 03:45:19,300
Come on!

3608
03:45:19,600 --> 03:45:19,880
Yeah!

3609
03:45:22,120 --> 03:45:24,440
Ok, I have to break all of them, I'm guessing.

3610
03:45:24,720 --> 03:45:26,040
Oh, no I don't.

3611
03:45:26,400 --> 03:45:26,840
Yippee!

3612
03:45:27,560 --> 03:45:29,180
Ok, that wasn't so bad.

3613
03:45:32,060 --> 03:45:33,260
Any hidden...

3614
03:45:33,260 --> 03:45:35,080
Any hidden...

3615
03:45:37,860 --> 03:45:38,460
No?

3616
03:45:38,660 --> 03:45:38,880
Ok.

3617
03:45:45,780 --> 03:45:47,000
How's the game been?

3618
03:45:47,360 --> 03:45:49,180
I think today...

3619
03:45:50,280 --> 03:45:51,020
Oh my god.

3620
03:45:51,120 --> 03:45:51,600
Oh my god.

3621
03:45:52,540 --> 03:45:55,240
It hasn't been so great, but it's ok.

3622
03:45:59,200 --> 03:45:59,980
Any... Well, no.

3623
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:01,440
I was gonna say the first one, too.

3624
03:46:02,500 --> 03:46:04,300
The first time I played this game, too.

3625
03:46:04,560 --> 03:46:11,580
If anything was going to tilt me enough to never want to play the series again, it would've been today and the first time I played it.

3626
03:46:27,170 --> 03:46:28,350
Have our off days.

3627
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:31,670
It just sucks that when you are online...

3628
03:46:31,670 --> 03:46:38,090
You're not allowed really to have an off day because then it seems like you're just not having fun and are miserable and stuff.

3629
03:46:38,090 --> 03:46:39,250
But that's ok.

3630
03:46:41,550 --> 03:46:45,070
It's not fun for people to watch you have an off day, you know what I mean?

3631
03:46:49,490 --> 03:46:55,370
And especially in games like this, I have to have a lot of patience because people try to give me advice.

3632
03:46:56,330 --> 03:46:59,610
And sometimes I'm like, yeah, this is advice!

3633
03:47:00,330 --> 03:47:05,950
And sometimes I'm like, ah, they're just backstabbing and it gets all frustrating for me.

3634
03:47:06,030 --> 03:47:07,470
Even though I know people just mean well.

3635
03:47:09,550 --> 03:47:11,310
So I try to have a level head about it.

3636
03:47:15,450 --> 03:47:17,870
As much as I can, even on my off days.

3637
03:47:26,680 --> 03:47:27,480
I disagree.

3638
03:47:27,720 --> 03:47:29,560
I enjoy frustrated ghost noises.

3639
03:47:29,760 --> 03:47:33,860
I think it's different when I'm frustrated and I'm like, ah, this is tricky.

3640
03:47:33,980 --> 03:47:36,960
And it's different, I think, when I'm frustrated and I'm just...

3641
03:47:36,960 --> 03:47:37,740
Pissy.

3642
03:47:37,740 --> 03:47:37,800
Pissy.

3643
03:47:41,060 --> 03:47:41,740
Samsara.

3644
03:47:43,020 --> 03:47:46,480
Sculpture symbolizing the time-space continuum.

3645
03:47:47,100 --> 03:47:48,620
Wow, we have something like that?

3646
03:47:48,860 --> 03:47:51,580
Use to restore order to time-space rifts.

3647
03:47:52,080 --> 03:47:54,960
Oh, we don't have any issues with that.

3648
03:47:55,180 --> 03:47:57,040
We don't have any time-space rifts.

3649
03:48:04,450 --> 03:48:05,130
Unless...

3650
03:48:09,930 --> 03:48:10,450
No.

3651
03:48:11,470 --> 03:48:12,150
No.

3652
03:48:13,930 --> 03:48:14,330
No.

3653
03:48:15,490 --> 03:48:16,530
You're doing really good, Mito.

3654
03:48:16,610 --> 03:48:18,170
Remember that we're happy when you're happy.

3655
03:48:18,910 --> 03:48:19,390
Thank you.

3656
03:48:20,650 --> 03:48:21,730
Oh, they're all gone.

3657
03:48:25,010 --> 03:48:25,810
The horse!

3658
03:48:26,110 --> 03:48:27,210
Yeah, the horse.

3659
03:48:27,710 --> 03:48:32,030
I can't believe I was just like, the horse is so easy, and then I died and gave up and never tried again.

3660
03:48:35,270 --> 03:48:38,330
I was like, you know what, I don't think I wanna play the horse.

3661
03:48:42,750 --> 03:48:43,150
Hello?

3662
03:48:43,650 --> 03:48:44,170
This way?

3663
03:48:45,150 --> 03:48:45,610
PTSD.

3664
03:48:47,090 --> 03:48:51,910
I think I did pretty alright with Beowulf trying again in the way that I did.

3665
03:48:53,230 --> 03:48:54,150
I think I did okay.

3666
03:48:56,570 --> 03:48:57,890
I gave it a couple shots.

3667
03:48:58,890 --> 03:49:00,310
It didn't work and then I left.

3668
03:49:07,290 --> 03:49:09,750
I'm gonna... The orb is so expensive.

3669
03:49:10,250 --> 03:49:11,250
I think I'm gonna get a porb.

3670
03:49:12,670 --> 03:49:14,150
I think I'm gonna get a porb.

3671
03:49:16,710 --> 03:49:18,390
They gave it a college try.

3672
03:49:18,610 --> 03:49:19,070
I did!

3673
03:49:21,190 --> 03:49:22,490
This is the door I go through, right?

3674
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:26,270
Oh no.

3675
03:49:26,430 --> 03:49:27,170
No, no, no, no, no.

3676
03:49:27,350 --> 03:49:28,270
No, no, let me out.

3677
03:49:28,430 --> 03:49:29,010
Wait, hold on.

3678
03:49:29,530 --> 03:49:29,990
Oh god.

3679
03:49:31,130 --> 03:49:31,810
I'm trapped.

3680
03:49:32,290 --> 03:49:33,390
Wait, am I going the right way?

3681
03:49:34,310 --> 03:49:34,950
Wrong portal.

3682
03:49:35,190 --> 03:49:35,390
Okay.

3683
03:49:36,410 --> 03:49:37,350
Gosh, there's another one?

3684
03:49:37,370 --> 03:49:38,270
I didn't even notice it.

3685
03:49:39,890 --> 03:49:41,470
I thought I was backtracking.

3686
03:49:43,130 --> 03:49:44,570
I suppose I'm not.

3687
03:49:47,790 --> 03:49:48,810
Is that it?

3688
03:49:49,870 --> 03:49:51,990
That looks funky.

3689
03:49:52,690 --> 03:49:53,210
Over there?

3690
03:49:53,690 --> 03:49:55,610
Me and my mom are cheering you on with pizza.

3691
03:49:56,230 --> 03:49:57,990
I want pizza!

3692
03:49:58,190 --> 03:49:59,450
What kind of pizza?

3693
03:50:00,250 --> 03:50:01,130
Oh, I went the wrong way.

3694
03:50:02,790 --> 03:50:03,350
It's a porbel.

3695
03:50:04,970 --> 03:50:06,090
The porbel.

3696
03:50:08,270 --> 03:50:09,330
I'm starting to get hungry.

3697
03:50:09,810 --> 03:50:10,510
Is this the one?

3698
03:50:10,910 --> 03:50:12,110
But this is the one I went through before.

3699
03:50:12,190 --> 03:50:13,030
I just go through it again.

3700
03:50:15,850 --> 03:50:17,570
A little confusing game.

3701
03:50:19,050 --> 03:50:19,670
There we go.

3702
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:30,500
Oh god, my eyes!

3703
03:50:33,040 --> 03:50:33,440
Okay.

3704
03:50:34,660 --> 03:50:36,940
I can't turn the camera all the way around?

3705
03:50:37,060 --> 03:50:37,560
Why not?

3706
03:50:38,220 --> 03:50:38,620
Why?

3707
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:42,480
Okay.

3708
03:50:50,420 --> 03:50:51,900
This really doesn't say anything.

3709
03:50:52,140 --> 03:50:55,840
Oh, substance projects image and image punishes substance.

3710
03:50:58,460 --> 03:50:59,860
I didn't even need to read.

3711
03:51:00,640 --> 03:51:01,120
What do you say?

3712
03:51:01,260 --> 03:51:04,600
Kicking ass today, watching you girls play TMC has been an incredible journey.

3713
03:51:04,760 --> 03:51:06,220
Even with frustrations, you're still winning.

3714
03:51:06,740 --> 03:51:08,060
And I'll be the whole way cheering you on.

3715
03:51:08,120 --> 03:51:09,120
Thanks Sparky!

3716
03:51:12,040 --> 03:51:14,280
Doesn't that broken statue remind you of someone?

3717
03:51:14,540 --> 03:51:14,840
This?

3718
03:51:18,340 --> 03:51:19,060
Oh, whoops.

3719
03:51:19,260 --> 03:51:19,520
Sorry.

3720
03:51:22,060 --> 03:51:23,580
Virtual Ghost GF.

3721
03:51:25,000 --> 03:51:27,520
I would propose, but I'm not ready for that sort of commitment.

3722
03:51:29,340 --> 03:51:31,340
You're already asking for a whole lot.

3723
03:51:35,720 --> 03:51:36,140
Wait.

3724
03:51:45,100 --> 03:51:47,000
Did I go through it the wrong way again?

3725
03:51:47,000 --> 03:51:47,020
This again?

3726
03:51:56,820 --> 03:51:58,300
Oh, the gold statue.

3727
03:51:59,340 --> 03:52:00,800
Oh, I need to interact with it.

3728
03:52:01,100 --> 03:52:02,620
Hold on, I'll go do it.

3729
03:52:04,120 --> 03:52:05,260
The gold statue.

3730
03:52:05,460 --> 03:52:05,600
Okay.

3731
03:52:09,650 --> 03:52:11,990
I thought it looked a little out of place, but...

3732
03:52:12,550 --> 03:52:12,770
Hello?

3733
03:52:13,610 --> 03:52:16,550
Stop the vicious circle by bending time and space.

3734
03:52:16,890 --> 03:52:18,730
Looks like something can be inserted here.

3735
03:52:19,550 --> 03:52:20,610
Okay, we insert.

3736
03:52:22,790 --> 03:52:23,930
That was...

3737
03:52:24,310 --> 03:52:25,850
We broke the cycle.

3738
03:52:26,110 --> 03:52:28,190
We're no longer Homura Kemi.

3739
03:52:30,650 --> 03:52:32,490
Madoka, I'll save you.

3740
03:52:33,150 --> 03:52:34,610
Oh, end of the line.

3741
03:52:35,830 --> 03:52:37,910
It's looking real Kingdom Hearts here, guys.

3742
03:52:42,110 --> 03:52:44,850
Looking mighty Kingdom Hearts here.

3743
03:52:52,810 --> 03:52:53,570
Okay.

3744
03:52:53,570 --> 03:52:54,250
I already bought some.

3745
03:52:55,750 --> 03:52:56,390
Okay.

3746
03:52:57,230 --> 03:52:58,030
Let's go.

3747
03:53:06,730 --> 03:53:07,490
Sparta.

3748
03:53:07,830 --> 03:53:08,730
Not Sparta.

3749
03:53:08,810 --> 03:53:09,690
You wish you were Sparta.

3750
03:53:16,730 --> 03:53:18,950
I can't understand your action.

3751
03:53:24,230 --> 03:53:25,830
Dante, I'm going to steal that one.

3752
03:53:27,110 --> 03:53:29,830
It's like a backed up toilet.

3753
03:53:42,720 --> 03:53:44,200
Enunciate your words, mister.

3754
03:53:58,240 --> 03:54:00,900
I'm glad Dante and I have the same look on our faces.

3755
03:54:03,220 --> 03:54:04,700
I hate that.

3756
03:54:11,520 --> 03:54:14,200
He literally turned into a genus.

3757
03:54:20,260 --> 03:54:21,700
The little...

3758
03:54:23,040 --> 03:54:25,460
Look, you see the gaping butthole.

3759
03:54:26,280 --> 03:54:27,040
Right there.

3760
03:54:28,020 --> 03:54:29,220
Forbidden Nirvana.

3761
03:54:31,900 --> 03:54:32,620
Okay.

3762
03:54:34,560 --> 03:54:37,240
I want to kill him with his daughter's weapon.

3763
03:54:38,060 --> 03:54:38,820
But it does nothing.

3764
03:54:46,660 --> 03:54:47,180
Okay.

3765
03:54:49,940 --> 03:54:50,460
Slugs!

3766
03:54:50,920 --> 03:54:52,580
Oh no, there are so many slugs!

3767
03:54:53,520 --> 03:54:55,160
There are so many slugs!

3768
03:54:55,620 --> 03:54:56,440
Oh my god.

3769
03:55:00,320 --> 03:55:01,860
What the hell is happening?

3770
03:55:15,860 --> 03:55:16,580
What the...

3771
03:55:17,200 --> 03:55:19,480
They all just chill and wait for me.

3772
03:55:25,340 --> 03:55:26,220
Is that you?

3773
03:55:26,800 --> 03:55:28,240
Is that your inhaler, mister?

3774
03:55:28,240 --> 03:55:29,960
What the...

3775
03:55:32,360 --> 03:55:35,760
Oh, is that his face?

3776
03:55:36,540 --> 03:55:37,100
Nasty!

3777
03:55:37,800 --> 03:55:38,360
Come here.

3778
03:55:38,800 --> 03:55:39,800
Come here, nasty.

3779
03:55:41,980 --> 03:55:42,940
Come here, nasty.

3780
03:55:43,640 --> 03:55:46,580
Let's see if

3781
03:56:28,360 --> 03:56:29,280
I can punch him instead.

3782
03:56:33,240 --> 03:56:33,980
Nasty.

3783
03:56:33,980 --> 03:56:34,060
Nasty.

3784
03:56:43,540 --> 03:56:45,740
When I press jump, that's what you need to do.

3785
03:56:45,840 --> 03:56:46,200
Oh my god.

3786
03:56:53,860 --> 03:56:56,740
Oh my god.

3787
03:57:04,760 --> 03:57:06,160
Please, just get rid of this guy.

3788
03:57:20,360 --> 03:57:22,520
You do more than just summon slugs.

3789
03:57:22,520 --> 03:57:22,580
Oops.

3790
03:57:29,340 --> 03:57:29,700
I

3791
03:57:33,470 --> 03:57:35,290
don't think I...

3792
03:57:37,330 --> 03:57:38,070
Oh my gosh.

3793
03:57:39,390 --> 03:57:40,170
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

3794
03:57:42,190 --> 03:57:42,870
Oh my god.

3795
03:57:43,150 --> 03:57:44,610
These guys are so obnoxious.

3796
03:57:44,990 --> 03:57:46,110
Oh my god, oh my god.

3797
03:57:46,490 --> 03:57:48,230
I don't know what's the best way to take care of them.

3798
03:57:48,330 --> 03:57:50,090
Slice and dice or...

3799
03:57:50,470 --> 03:57:51,970
Oh my god, they are so annoying.

3800
03:58:01,010 --> 03:58:02,550
Oh my god.

3801
03:58:04,610 --> 03:58:05,790
Oh, there's still a guy.

3802
03:58:12,050 --> 03:58:14,230
We're gonna chip at him away.

3803
03:58:14,950 --> 03:58:16,150
Like we always do.

3804
03:58:16,830 --> 03:58:17,890
Until I get more DT.

3805
03:58:18,950 --> 03:58:19,870
And then I can...

3806
03:58:20,830 --> 03:58:21,970
What the hell are...

3807
03:58:21,970 --> 03:58:23,250
Are those more slugs?

3808
03:58:23,590 --> 03:58:24,790
More slugs!

3809
03:58:25,550 --> 03:58:27,410
More, even more slugs!

3810
03:58:28,290 --> 03:58:29,750
Even more slugs!

3811
03:58:43,710 --> 03:58:45,130
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

3812
03:58:45,350 --> 03:58:45,770
There we go.

3813
03:58:45,990 --> 03:58:46,610
Nice, nice, nice.

3814
03:58:47,610 --> 03:58:48,470
Let's punch him.

3815
03:58:52,770 --> 03:58:54,930
Gotta get our little RPG in first.

3816
03:58:56,330 --> 03:58:56,910
I'm punching him.

3817
03:58:57,110 --> 03:58:57,710
I'm punching him.

3818
03:58:58,030 --> 03:58:58,650
I'm punching him.

3819
03:58:58,950 --> 03:58:59,830
Oh, now I'm scared.

3820
03:59:00,410 --> 03:59:01,130
Scared to punch.

3821
03:59:01,370 --> 03:59:02,070
Scared to keep punching.

3822
03:59:09,790 --> 03:59:10,230
Okay.

3823
03:59:11,070 --> 03:59:12,310
Punch, punch, punch!

3824
03:59:14,370 --> 03:59:15,250
More slugs!

3825
03:59:17,270 --> 03:59:17,710
No,

3826
03:59:30,460 --> 03:59:31,560
I'm trying to lock on.

3827
03:59:32,300 --> 03:59:33,020
Oh my god.

3828
03:59:33,140 --> 03:59:33,820
Oh my god.

3829
03:59:39,200 --> 03:59:40,700
Okay, I think we got him.

3830
03:59:45,220 --> 03:59:46,100
I'm gonna...

3831
03:59:48,880 --> 03:59:50,400
I don't know what's good for him.

3832
03:59:55,660 --> 03:59:57,360
I got you to half health!

3833
03:59:57,400 --> 03:59:58,360
What are you talking about?

3834
04:00:02,220 --> 04:00:03,700
I got you to half health!

3835
04:00:05,180 --> 04:00:06,620
My brother!

3836
04:00:07,460 --> 04:00:08,740
My brother!

3837
04:00:09,520 --> 04:00:10,320
Oh my god.

3838
04:00:11,740 --> 04:00:12,280
Where are you?

3839
04:00:14,220 --> 04:00:18,920
I've come to retrieve my power.

3840
04:00:29,990 --> 04:00:34,790
I've always wanted Virgil as my brother.

3841
04:00:36,210 --> 04:00:38,030
He deserves to be our main vendor.

3842
04:00:42,860 --> 04:00:44,030
You're right.

3843
04:00:58,320 --> 04:01:00,380
He's wagging his finger at him.

3844
04:01:02,420 --> 04:01:03,320
Yeah, buddy.

3845
04:01:13,620 --> 04:01:15,580
Battle of brothers.

3846
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:16,940
Oh my god!

3847
04:01:16,940 --> 04:01:20,220
Show Arkham the true power of the sons of Sparda!

3848
04:01:21,120 --> 04:01:25,760
Virgil follows Dante's lead but still spins off his own special style of ass kicking.

3849
04:01:29,200 --> 04:01:32,120
Press the A to call Virgil to your side.

3850
04:01:32,320 --> 04:01:33,260
Oh my god!

3851
04:01:35,160 --> 04:01:37,900
You cannot utilize demon form while fighting with Virgil.

3852
04:01:38,820 --> 04:01:39,480
Wait, what?

3853
04:01:40,740 --> 04:01:41,740
I can't double trigger?

3854
04:01:48,560 --> 04:01:51,660
Can I get like a... Can you... Oh my god, my brother.

3855
04:01:52,380 --> 04:01:53,840
Can he give me like a...

3856
04:01:56,520 --> 04:01:59,640
Give me a gore while I'm, you know, since I...

3857
04:02:03,180 --> 04:02:03,920
Oh god.

3858
04:02:04,760 --> 04:02:05,800
Why can't I double trigger?

3859
04:02:06,960 --> 04:02:09,300
Come on, I need you to... I need you to work.

3860
04:02:10,200 --> 04:02:10,680
Oh god.

3861
04:02:15,000 --> 04:02:15,780
Oh my god.

3862
04:02:17,040 --> 04:02:17,440
Oh.

3863
04:02:17,700 --> 04:02:17,940
Ah!

3864
04:02:18,220 --> 04:02:18,420
Shoot.

3865
04:02:20,740 --> 04:02:21,500
Oh, he killed him.

3866
04:02:21,580 --> 04:02:21,760
Maybe?

3867
04:02:21,900 --> 04:02:22,040
No.

3868
04:02:22,160 --> 04:02:22,520
No, he didn't.

3869
04:02:22,720 --> 04:02:23,080
Come on.

3870
04:02:23,420 --> 04:02:24,120
Can you do something?

3871
04:02:26,860 --> 04:02:27,460
Oh god.

3872
04:02:27,560 --> 04:02:27,880
Oh god.

3873
04:02:27,980 --> 04:02:28,280
Oh god.

3874
04:02:28,620 --> 04:02:29,760
I really need to heal though.

3875
04:02:32,600 --> 04:02:33,800
I really need to heal.

3876
04:02:41,230 --> 04:02:44,160
I really need to heal.

3877
04:02:44,700 --> 04:02:45,920
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

3878
04:02:46,400 --> 04:02:48,040
I wish he would like... I still attack.

3879
04:02:50,580 --> 04:02:50,940
Oh.

3880
04:02:50,940 --> 04:02:52,900
Oh, do I restart at the very beginning?

3881
04:02:59,020 --> 04:02:59,740
Oh, OK.

3882
04:02:59,840 --> 04:03:01,660
Well, now that I know that...

3883
04:03:12,120 --> 04:03:14,160
Now that we know that...

3884
04:03:21,820 --> 04:03:23,440
Now that we know that we can't heal...

3885
04:03:25,140 --> 04:03:30,780
Yeah, I wish he would like kind of do a little bit of anything while, you know...

3886
04:03:30,780 --> 04:03:35,580
And I feel a little bit better about this now.

3887
04:03:47,280 --> 04:03:49,040
Oh, he hits hard though.

3888
04:03:49,240 --> 04:03:50,520
Oh, he hits really hard.

3889
04:03:51,180 --> 04:03:51,960
Holy moly.

3890
04:03:56,120 --> 04:03:56,960
Oh gosh.

3891
04:03:57,980 --> 04:03:59,540
I don't know his like fighting at all.

3892
04:04:00,080 --> 04:04:03,420
He just like slams his hand and then he also shoots a thing.

3893
04:04:05,760 --> 04:04:06,680
What the hell is that?

3894
04:04:06,760 --> 04:04:07,060
Oh!

3895
04:04:07,180 --> 04:04:08,320
Oh, that's the thing that he shoots.

3896
04:04:08,460 --> 04:04:08,720
OK.

3897
04:04:09,420 --> 04:04:09,660
OK.

3898
04:04:09,920 --> 04:04:10,260
I got it.

3899
04:04:10,300 --> 04:04:10,560
I got it.

3900
04:04:10,640 --> 04:04:10,920
I got it.

3901
04:04:12,620 --> 04:04:12,980
Oh

3902
04:04:16,260 --> 04:04:16,540
my god.

3903
04:04:16,620 --> 04:04:17,000
Oh my god.

3904
04:04:25,480 --> 04:04:26,680
I'll just stand here.

3905
04:04:27,100 --> 04:04:27,880
I'll spam.

3906
04:04:28,940 --> 04:04:29,300
Spam.

3907
04:05:12,100 --> 04:05:12,820
Oh god.

3908
04:05:16,440 --> 04:05:16,820
OK.

3909
04:05:20,120 --> 04:05:24,160
Maybe this one... I don't remember what I... I think it was this one that I used before that I was like...

3910
04:05:24,160 --> 04:05:24,980
Oh, this isn't so bad.

3911
04:05:27,280 --> 04:05:27,780
Come on.

3912
04:05:27,920 --> 04:05:28,220
Come on.

3913
04:05:29,320 --> 04:05:29,880
Come on.

3914
04:05:30,900 --> 04:05:32,300
Oh, nice.

3915
04:05:32,380 --> 04:05:32,940
We avoided that.

3916
04:05:33,180 --> 04:05:35,240
But then we got hit by his little tiny hand.

3917
04:05:41,210 --> 04:05:41,970
So nasty.

3918
04:05:44,870 --> 04:05:45,870
Oh my goodness.

3919
04:05:48,670 --> 04:05:49,130
Again?

3920
04:05:50,270 --> 04:05:52,550
Oh, we're not doing as well this time.

3921
04:05:53,550 --> 04:05:56,610
We're not doing as well this time, but that's OK.

3922
04:06:07,130 --> 04:06:09,650
Trying to decide if I want to use it or not.

3923
04:06:14,370 --> 04:06:16,030
I do have one holy water.

3924
04:06:17,410 --> 04:06:19,390
Save stars till you're close to phase two.

3925
04:06:20,530 --> 04:06:20,990
OK.

3926
04:06:25,610 --> 04:06:27,710
I'll just heal with these guys.

3927
04:06:31,670 --> 04:06:32,350
Oh god.

3928
04:06:40,070 --> 04:06:41,050
They're so nasty.

3929
04:06:41,350 --> 04:06:42,270
They're so awful.

3930
04:06:42,750 --> 04:06:43,150
Oh god.

3931
04:06:49,650 --> 04:06:51,630
I don't know if I'm close to phase two or not.

3932
04:06:51,710 --> 04:06:53,030
I feel like I might be.

3933
04:06:54,390 --> 04:06:56,070
But it's also hard to tell.

3934
04:06:56,470 --> 04:06:57,090
Oh my god.

3935
04:06:57,170 --> 04:06:57,710
Oh my god.

3936
04:06:57,770 --> 04:06:58,550
Oh my god.

3937
04:07:00,970 --> 04:07:02,310
He's going to shoot his nasty.

3938
04:07:03,130 --> 04:07:04,730
He's going to shoot it at me.

3939
04:07:07,490 --> 04:07:07,930
OK.

3940
04:07:14,610 --> 04:07:16,010
Now, definitely use it.

3941
04:07:21,980 --> 04:07:22,420
Huge.

3942
04:07:22,420 --> 04:07:22,860
Huge.

3943
04:07:22,940 --> 04:07:23,180
Huge.

3944
04:07:23,300 --> 04:07:23,460
Huge.

3945
04:07:23,580 --> 04:07:23,720
OK.

3946
04:07:23,820 --> 04:07:27,300
Now, don't touch the devil star because we can't even use it.

3947
04:07:28,100 --> 04:07:28,780
Alright.

3948
04:07:30,060 --> 04:07:30,460
Alright.

3949
04:07:31,200 --> 04:07:31,880
Nice.

3950
04:07:40,330 --> 04:07:41,010
Scum.

3951
04:07:41,010 --> 04:07:41,690
Scum.

3952
04:07:42,790 --> 04:07:43,470
Scum.

3953
04:07:46,310 --> 04:07:46,990
I

3954
04:07:54,120 --> 04:07:56,620
can use the small one too if I have to.

3955
04:07:58,340 --> 04:07:59,280
Come on.

3956
04:07:59,840 --> 04:08:00,420
Kill them.

3957
04:08:00,620 --> 04:08:01,300
Scum.

3958
04:08:01,720 --> 04:08:02,900
Call them what they are.

3959
04:08:03,540 --> 04:08:04,200
Scum.

3960
04:08:05,140 --> 04:08:05,760
Die.

3961
04:08:06,240 --> 04:08:07,040
Keep killing them.

3962
04:08:07,080 --> 04:08:07,980
Keep killing them, Virgil.

3963
04:08:07,980 --> 04:08:09,040
Keep doing it.

3964
04:08:09,300 --> 04:08:10,620
Virgil, I need your help.

3965
04:08:11,280 --> 04:08:11,940
Oh my god.

3966
04:08:13,620 --> 04:08:14,020
Scum.

3967
04:08:16,440 --> 04:08:16,840
Nice.

3968
04:08:23,860 --> 04:08:24,260
Nice.

3969
04:08:26,800 --> 04:08:27,860
Oh my god.

3970
04:08:27,940 --> 04:08:28,300
Oh my god.

3971
04:08:28,420 --> 04:08:29,200
That's not good at all.

3972
04:08:30,640 --> 04:08:31,420
Come on, Virgil.

3973
04:08:31,640 --> 04:08:32,460
Virgil, I need you to hit.

3974
04:08:32,740 --> 04:08:33,480
I need you to hit too.

3975
04:08:33,820 --> 04:08:34,820
I need us to both hit.

3976
04:08:38,000 --> 04:08:38,720
Come on.

3977
04:08:38,800 --> 04:08:39,380
Come on.

3978
04:08:39,540 --> 04:08:40,140
Come on.

3979
04:08:40,180 --> 04:08:40,560
Come on.

3980
04:08:40,600 --> 04:08:41,200
Come on.

3981
04:08:41,220 --> 04:08:42,740
If I have to use another item, I will.

3982
04:08:43,040 --> 04:08:43,500
I will.

3983
04:08:43,620 --> 04:08:44,460
I'm not afraid to.

3984
04:08:48,320 --> 04:08:48,680
Scum.

3985
04:08:50,380 --> 04:08:51,660
Will the holy water work on him?

3986
04:08:55,260 --> 04:08:55,920
Vital S.

3987
04:08:55,980 --> 04:08:56,760
That's what I was thinking.

3988
04:08:56,940 --> 04:08:57,740
This tinier one.

3989
04:08:59,080 --> 04:08:59,900
Let's just take it.

3990
04:09:01,040 --> 04:09:01,540
It will.

3991
04:09:04,100 --> 04:09:04,960
I can't see.

3992
04:09:05,100 --> 04:09:05,580
Oh my god.

3993
04:09:05,640 --> 04:09:05,900
Hold on.

3994
04:09:06,180 --> 04:09:06,760
I'll use it.

3995
04:09:06,880 --> 04:09:07,620
Let's try it.

3996
04:09:07,820 --> 04:09:08,020
Item.

3997
04:09:08,720 --> 04:09:09,480
Holy water.

3998
04:09:10,880 --> 04:09:11,240
Use.

3999
04:09:15,600 --> 04:09:17,220
Oh my god.

4000
04:09:17,500 --> 04:09:18,480
It did mega damage.

4001
04:09:18,760 --> 04:09:19,500
Did you guys see that?

4002
04:09:19,780 --> 04:09:20,120
Oh my god.

4003
04:09:20,140 --> 04:09:20,900
We are so close.

4004
04:09:21,320 --> 04:09:22,140
We are so close.

4005
04:09:33,200 --> 04:09:33,560
Scum.

4006
04:09:33,980 --> 04:09:34,400
Come on.

4007
04:09:34,420 --> 04:09:34,740
Just kill.

4008
04:09:34,820 --> 04:09:35,120
Just kill.

4009
04:09:35,200 --> 04:09:35,540
Just kill.

4010
04:09:35,780 --> 04:09:36,340
Just kill.

4011
04:09:36,420 --> 04:09:36,780
Just kill.

4012
04:09:36,840 --> 04:09:37,500
Just take them out.

4013
04:09:43,920 --> 04:09:44,880
Scum.

4014
04:09:45,700 --> 04:09:46,440
There he is.

4015
04:09:46,480 --> 04:09:46,760
Come on.

4016
04:09:46,780 --> 04:09:47,200
Come on.

4017
04:09:51,820 --> 04:09:52,780
Please.

4018
04:10:00,840 --> 04:10:01,820
So scary.

4019
04:10:02,420 --> 04:10:03,580
I got the first hit in.

4020
04:10:07,700 --> 04:10:10,100
This guy sucks.

4021
04:10:17,010 --> 04:10:18,590
Thanks Virgil.

4022
04:10:20,110 --> 04:10:21,650
Oh my god.

4023
04:10:29,480 --> 04:10:32,080
We traded swords through his body.

4024
04:10:32,620 --> 04:10:34,100
That's so... Oh my god.

4025
04:10:34,120 --> 04:10:34,860
That's so metal.

4026
04:10:35,800 --> 04:10:37,480
Take him out.

4027
04:10:41,760 --> 04:10:42,200
Eww.

4028
04:10:42,220 --> 04:10:43,360
His ugly face.

4029
04:10:46,880 --> 04:10:47,740
Oh my god.

4030
04:10:47,860 --> 04:10:48,040
See?

4031
04:10:48,140 --> 04:10:49,740
This is what it could have been with me and Lady.

4032
04:11:18,960 --> 04:11:19,840
Yeah.

4033
04:11:23,220 --> 04:11:24,120
Not very classy.

4034
04:11:26,600 --> 04:11:27,980
They are so smooth.

4035
04:11:29,500 --> 04:11:31,040
With every movement they do.

4036
04:11:31,140 --> 04:11:32,300
Their necklaces!

4037
04:11:35,760 --> 04:11:37,640
Who's gonna get the sword first?

4038
04:11:39,740 --> 04:11:40,800
Oh my god.

4039
04:11:40,840 --> 04:11:42,220
They defeated the ender dragon.

4040
04:11:43,840 --> 04:11:45,440
You the player.

4041
04:11:47,140 --> 04:11:49,600
Don't think I'll be scum any time of the day.

4042
04:11:52,940 --> 04:11:54,220
20 minutes.

4043
04:12:00,080 --> 04:12:01,340
Boss bonus.

4044
04:12:03,400 --> 04:12:04,100
Alright baby.

4045
04:12:07,220 --> 04:12:08,360
Alright baby.

4046
04:12:08,640 --> 04:12:08,640
Alright baby.

4047
04:12:08,780 --> 04:12:09,540
Final mission.

4048
04:12:10,520 --> 04:12:12,320
Give me all your energy.

4049
04:12:17,790 --> 04:12:19,230
Final mission.

4050
04:12:19,790 --> 04:12:20,250
I suppose.

4051
04:12:21,930 --> 04:12:22,350
Lady.

4052
04:12:23,930 --> 04:12:24,750
She's so chill.

4053
04:12:24,830 --> 04:12:25,590
Just walking up.

4054
04:12:29,210 --> 04:12:29,930
Sorry.

4055
04:12:31,450 --> 04:12:33,230
I have a pinched nerve in my shoulder.

4056
04:12:33,630 --> 04:12:35,150
So I'm like...

4057
04:12:38,170 --> 04:12:38,770
Yeah!

4058
04:12:39,630 --> 04:12:41,370
Kicked him right out of hell!

4059
04:12:43,250 --> 04:12:43,850
Wow.

4060
04:12:44,150 --> 04:12:46,350
You suck so much you got kicked out of hell.

4061
04:12:47,450 --> 04:12:48,750
My fave boss in the game.

4062
04:12:50,350 --> 04:12:51,470
Combo use doppelganger.

4063
04:12:52,530 --> 04:12:53,130
Oh.

4064
04:12:53,210 --> 04:12:54,510
I forgot about doppelganger.

4065
04:12:56,870 --> 04:12:58,070
How do I use it?

4066
04:13:02,330 --> 04:13:02,930
Nah.

4067
04:13:02,970 --> 04:13:03,710
Because you suck.

4068
04:13:03,710 --> 04:13:03,770
You suck.

4069
04:13:08,210 --> 04:13:08,810
Okay.

4070
04:13:10,670 --> 04:13:11,950
Neanderthal looking ass.

4071
04:13:12,190 --> 04:13:12,970
Get out of here.

4072
04:13:14,250 --> 04:13:15,750
Get out of here.

4073
04:13:15,970 --> 04:13:17,690
This guy is just a cockroach.

4074
04:13:17,750 --> 04:13:18,490
He doesn't die.

4075
04:13:20,190 --> 04:13:21,410
I should call him Mitara.

4076
04:13:21,850 --> 04:13:22,690
Oh my god.

4077
04:13:36,030 --> 04:13:38,550
Don't ever call me that again.

4078
04:13:39,090 --> 04:13:42,210
My mother was the only one who could say my name.

4079
04:13:45,470 --> 04:13:48,080
Shoot me?

4080
04:13:49,240 --> 04:13:50,920
Can you shoot me?

4081
04:13:51,920 --> 04:13:53,020
Your own father?

4082
04:13:56,380 --> 04:13:58,140
What have I done wrong?

4083
04:13:58,860 --> 04:14:02,840
Even Horrocks Bard has sacrificed a woman so that he could become a legend.

4084
04:14:03,780 --> 04:14:05,840
I wish to be a god!

4085
04:14:06,600 --> 04:14:07,700
What have I done wrong?

4086
04:14:07,740 --> 04:14:12,280
And I sacrificed one miserable human being for that reason.

4087
04:14:12,600 --> 04:14:13,080
Miserable?

4088
04:14:13,300 --> 04:14:14,140
That is all.

4089
04:14:15,300 --> 04:14:16,460
Was that really so?

4090
04:14:16,460 --> 04:14:16,820
I know.

4091
04:14:16,960 --> 04:14:17,100
Yeah.

4092
04:14:17,220 --> 04:14:18,820
I'd argue quite a bit wrong buddy.

4093
04:14:19,240 --> 04:14:21,500
I think you kind of really messed up him.

4094
04:14:22,720 --> 04:14:24,600
He's more than just a silly guy.

4095
04:14:24,980 --> 04:14:25,340
Look it.

4096
04:14:26,440 --> 04:14:28,180
He's got bad hemorrhoids.

4097
04:14:29,140 --> 04:14:31,360
Mary died a long time ago.

4098
04:14:32,080 --> 04:14:34,680
My name is Lady.

4099
04:14:34,820 --> 04:14:35,860
She took Lady!

4100
04:14:36,700 --> 04:14:38,060
Goodbye father.

4101
04:14:40,340 --> 04:14:43,580
What a pathetic, pathetic guy.

4102
04:14:44,100 --> 04:14:46,160
His last words were no.

4103
04:14:48,260 --> 04:14:50,000
What a pathetic guy.

4104
04:14:50,740 --> 04:14:51,180
Oh my god.

4105
04:14:51,240 --> 04:14:53,420
Imagine your last words being something really stupid.

4106
04:14:53,620 --> 04:14:54,700
Like spaghetti or something.

4107
04:14:55,100 --> 04:14:57,460
That would be so silly.

4108
04:14:58,320 --> 04:14:59,020
Rip Bozo!

4109
04:15:07,340 --> 04:15:08,660
She's lamowing.

4110
04:15:09,540 --> 04:15:11,160
She's ruffling right now.

4111
04:15:11,300 --> 04:15:13,180
She's rolling on the floor laughing.

4112
04:15:17,140 --> 04:15:18,220
She thought he's through.

4113
04:15:18,380 --> 04:15:19,380
Thanks for 9 months.

4114
04:15:24,140 --> 04:15:25,100
Lady.

4115
04:15:30,900 --> 04:15:33,180
I like Lady.

4116
04:15:33,180 --> 04:15:37,100
Oh I saw the 20.

4117
04:15:37,580 --> 04:15:39,120
I saw the 20 in the sky.

4118
04:15:39,260 --> 04:15:39,600
I saw it.

4119
04:15:39,680 --> 04:15:39,960
I saw it.

4120
04:15:40,020 --> 04:15:40,480
I saw it.

4121
04:15:40,500 --> 04:15:41,240
20 in the clouds.

4122
04:15:42,180 --> 04:15:43,140
Screaming souls.

4123
04:15:43,840 --> 04:15:46,680
Cast off your pride and embrace your fate.

4124
04:15:49,220 --> 04:15:50,180
Alright guys.

4125
04:15:52,820 --> 04:15:53,780
Alright guys.

4126
04:15:55,560 --> 04:15:56,160
Let's go.

4127
04:15:57,020 --> 04:15:59,140
Is there anything I should buy before we go?

4128
04:16:00,360 --> 04:16:02,200
Anymore items or anything like that?

4129
04:16:02,260 --> 04:16:03,120
Or you think I'll be okay?

4130
04:16:05,780 --> 04:16:07,040
I have 30,000.

4131
04:16:10,060 --> 04:16:11,160
Heals for sure.

4132
04:16:12,140 --> 04:16:13,660
You guys are scaring me.

4133
04:16:16,600 --> 04:16:18,380
Spaghetti-chan would be so upset.

4134
04:16:19,140 --> 04:16:19,700
You said that.

4135
04:16:28,540 --> 04:16:30,100
Lot of heals.

4136
04:16:31,140 --> 04:16:31,780
Okay.

4137
04:16:33,820 --> 04:16:35,900
Do you think like 4 is enough?

4138
04:16:43,540 --> 04:16:44,180
5.

4139
04:16:44,960 --> 04:16:46,760
Okay we'll get 5 heals.

4140
04:16:52,080 --> 04:16:53,780
I'll even get some small ones.

4141
04:16:57,940 --> 04:16:59,220
A gorb.

4142
04:16:59,360 --> 04:17:00,580
Oh I didn't think about that.

4143
04:17:02,700 --> 04:17:03,580
Uh...

4144
04:17:03,580 --> 04:17:04,380
Ripperoni.

4145
04:17:07,340 --> 04:17:09,900
I still have 2 devil stars.

4146
04:17:14,780 --> 04:17:16,280
He's too fast.

4147
04:17:16,900 --> 04:17:17,760
He's too cool.

4148
04:17:18,740 --> 04:17:19,920
His little smirk.

4149
04:17:21,740 --> 04:17:21,940
No!

4150
04:17:24,160 --> 04:17:24,440
Yeah!

4151
04:17:27,120 --> 04:17:28,480
Blow the bank in this way.

4152
04:17:28,480 --> 04:17:30,880
Why are you so greedy?

4153
04:17:31,480 --> 04:17:32,580
Virgil, come on.

4154
04:17:35,520 --> 04:17:37,500
You are like papa.

4155
04:17:39,280 --> 04:17:42,100
You will never be like papa.

4156
04:17:56,970 --> 04:17:58,810
His soul.

4157
04:17:59,590 --> 04:18:00,490
This is soul.

4158
04:18:03,290 --> 04:18:06,690
My soul is saying it wants to stop you!

4159
04:18:07,070 --> 04:18:08,590
It wants to stop you!

4160
04:18:22,650 --> 04:18:24,360
You got all the...

4161
04:18:24,670 --> 04:18:26,380
You got all the dominant genes.

4162
04:18:27,960 --> 04:18:28,580
Oh gosh.

4163
04:18:30,000 --> 04:18:31,180
Unsacred Hellgate.

4164
04:18:31,340 --> 04:18:32,100
Hey Virgil!

4165
04:18:33,380 --> 04:18:36,060
If I walk this way and you walk that way...

4166
04:18:36,060 --> 04:18:36,620
Oh god.

4167
04:18:39,320 --> 04:18:40,460
I'm on trickster.

4168
04:18:40,620 --> 04:18:40,680
Okay.

4169
04:18:42,640 --> 04:18:44,180
We've done this fight before.

4170
04:18:46,360 --> 04:18:47,380
Oh my god.

4171
04:18:48,260 --> 04:18:48,880
Wait where am I?

4172
04:18:48,960 --> 04:18:49,140
Okay.

4173
04:18:50,500 --> 04:18:51,400
I need the air hike.

4174
04:18:56,520 --> 04:18:57,120
Scum!

4175
04:18:59,620 --> 04:19:01,440
We got one measly hidden.

4176
04:19:03,380 --> 04:19:05,940
What the hell is that?!

4177
04:19:08,000 --> 04:19:09,820
Oh no way.

4178
04:19:14,950 --> 04:19:16,030
Oh my god.

4179
04:19:16,710 --> 04:19:17,130
Okay.

4180
04:19:17,530 --> 04:19:19,070
I'm gonna be aggressive for this fight.

4181
04:19:19,310 --> 04:19:20,190
A little bit.

4182
04:19:26,900 --> 04:19:28,380
Can he also devil trigger?

4183
04:19:31,640 --> 04:19:32,800
No, don't do that.

4184
04:19:32,900 --> 04:19:33,320
Don't do that.

4185
04:19:35,860 --> 04:19:36,420
Scum.

4186
04:19:37,600 --> 04:19:39,000
Oh he can.

4187
04:19:39,200 --> 04:19:39,420
Okay.

4188
04:19:39,600 --> 04:19:40,060
He can.

4189
04:19:41,380 --> 04:19:41,940
Understood.

4190
04:19:42,520 --> 04:19:43,340
Oh my god.

4191
04:19:44,400 --> 04:19:45,180
Yes he can.

4192
04:19:46,300 --> 04:19:48,240
Why am I even trying to touch him in this mode?

4193
04:19:51,600 --> 04:19:53,580
Are we like flowing down the river?

4194
04:19:53,680 --> 04:19:55,400
If we touch the end we die?

4195
04:19:59,830 --> 04:20:00,630
He's healing.

4196
04:20:00,810 --> 04:20:01,090
I know.

4197
04:20:01,490 --> 04:20:01,790
I know.

4198
04:20:01,930 --> 04:20:02,210
I know.

4199
04:20:07,190 --> 04:20:08,010
Shit man.

4200
04:20:15,300 --> 04:20:16,460
Oh my gosh.

4201
04:20:16,540 --> 04:20:18,840
How does he get me so...

4202
04:20:22,480 --> 04:20:22,960
Gosh.

4203
04:20:23,460 --> 04:20:23,800
Come here.

4204
04:20:24,340 --> 04:20:24,620
Dang.

4205
04:20:24,680 --> 04:20:25,900
He heals a lot too.

4206
04:20:26,240 --> 04:20:28,620
This guy is seriously... He seriously cheats.

4207
04:20:30,200 --> 04:20:30,680
Okay.

4208
04:20:30,740 --> 04:20:32,200
Someone said do doppelganger.

4209
04:20:32,400 --> 04:20:33,140
How do I do this?

4210
04:20:33,820 --> 04:20:34,160
Wait.

4211
04:20:34,220 --> 04:20:34,620
Hold on.

4212
04:20:34,780 --> 04:20:36,980
I'm trying to figure out this new move I just got.

4213
04:20:37,880 --> 04:20:39,020
How do I use it?

4214
04:20:39,300 --> 04:20:39,780
Doppelganger.

4215
04:20:41,520 --> 04:20:42,560
Oh it's DT?

4216
04:20:43,700 --> 04:20:44,700
No it's not.

4217
04:20:45,540 --> 04:20:46,680
I got one guide.

4218
04:20:48,240 --> 04:20:49,640
I got one guide.

4219
04:20:51,540 --> 04:20:52,740
Lock on A.

4220
04:20:57,600 --> 04:20:59,040
Oh you need DT.

4221
04:21:02,360 --> 04:21:03,060
Hold on.

4222
04:21:03,120 --> 04:21:04,480
I'm gonna go time that guy out.

4223
04:21:04,880 --> 04:21:05,140
You!

4224
04:21:05,500 --> 04:21:06,340
Where are you?

4225
04:21:07,460 --> 04:21:08,840
Actually I don't know who said it first.

4226
04:21:09,840 --> 04:21:11,640
Don't tell me when to DT you guys.

4227
04:21:12,480 --> 04:21:13,680
Don't tell me when to DT.

4228
04:21:14,120 --> 04:21:14,400
Okay.

4229
04:21:14,780 --> 04:21:15,340
Oh I forgot.

4230
04:21:16,820 --> 04:21:18,120
How do I avoid you?

4231
04:21:18,520 --> 04:21:19,460
Oh my god.

4232
04:21:19,800 --> 04:21:20,820
This damn homing.

4233
04:21:24,120 --> 04:21:24,720
Oh shit.

4234
04:21:25,320 --> 04:21:26,920
He's gonna be like full health after this.

4235
04:21:33,140 --> 04:21:34,340
Oh my god.

4236
04:21:49,470 --> 04:21:52,830
So I need to lock on A when I have DT.

4237
04:21:52,830 --> 04:21:52,890
Wait.

4238
04:21:53,010 --> 04:21:53,370
Hold on.

4239
04:21:55,470 --> 04:21:57,390
So now I'm doing double damage?

4240
04:21:57,510 --> 04:21:58,090
Is that what's happening?

4241
04:22:01,030 --> 04:22:01,990
I'm about to die.

4242
04:22:02,170 --> 04:22:02,830
Yeah there we go.

4243
04:22:05,590 --> 04:22:07,410
Shooting will counter the sword throw.

4244
04:22:08,550 --> 04:22:09,510
I see.

4245
04:22:12,470 --> 04:22:13,430
I see.

4246
04:22:24,260 --> 04:22:26,800
Oh my god.

4247
04:22:29,260 --> 04:22:31,340
Guys, is there a way to cheese this?

4248
04:22:32,580 --> 04:22:33,480
Oh my god.

4249
04:22:33,780 --> 04:22:35,680
It's just combo after combo.

4250
04:22:39,540 --> 04:22:40,860
Oh my god.

4251
04:22:40,960 --> 04:22:42,120
Oh my god.

4252
04:22:42,260 --> 04:22:43,020
Oh my god.

4253
04:22:43,320 --> 04:22:44,000
Oh my god.

4254
04:22:44,340 --> 04:22:44,940
Oh my god.

4255
04:22:45,080 --> 04:22:45,820
Oh my god.

4256
04:22:46,740 --> 04:22:47,440
Oh my god.

4257
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:48,280
Oh my god.

4258
04:22:57,780 --> 04:22:59,260
Holy water spam.

4259
04:22:59,360 --> 04:23:01,680
You guys told me to buy heals at holy water.

4260
04:23:05,900 --> 04:23:09,800
Doppelganger just makes a clone that will mimic your movement with a slight delayed combo.

4261
04:23:10,080 --> 04:23:12,240
It's not really good compared to even Quicksilver.

4262
04:23:13,320 --> 04:23:14,100
Hold on.

4263
04:23:14,280 --> 04:23:15,720
Hold on.

4264
04:23:24,200 --> 04:23:25,620
Dante in the first Virgil fight.

4265
04:23:25,780 --> 04:23:26,900
Father, I don't have a father.

4266
04:23:27,140 --> 04:23:28,040
I just don't like you.

4267
04:23:28,880 --> 04:23:30,660
Dante in final Virgil fight.

4268
04:23:31,060 --> 04:23:32,380
We are the sons of Sparda.

4269
04:23:32,600 --> 04:23:33,260
I know, right?

4270
04:23:33,800 --> 04:23:35,460
This is what we call character development.

4271
04:23:36,740 --> 04:23:43,800
How did I get... How did I even... How was I... I don't know how I managed to attack him before.

4272
04:23:49,880 --> 04:23:51,800
We're both in double trigger now.

4273
04:23:52,060 --> 04:23:53,160
Until... Not anymore.

4274
04:23:54,340 --> 04:23:56,500
How did I... How did I...

4275
04:23:59,800 --> 04:24:00,260
Scum.

4276
04:24:03,320 --> 04:24:03,780
Ouch.

4277
04:24:04,420 --> 04:24:04,880
God.

4278
04:24:09,300 --> 04:24:09,760
Ouch.

4279
04:24:12,800 --> 04:24:13,560
Oh, okay.

4280
04:24:13,840 --> 04:24:14,000
It did.

4281
04:24:14,120 --> 04:24:14,340
It did.

4282
04:24:15,320 --> 04:24:16,160
Oh, ouch.

4283
04:24:16,300 --> 04:24:16,480
Ouch.

4284
04:24:16,560 --> 04:24:16,680
Ouch.

4285
04:24:16,860 --> 04:24:17,900
I didn't realize what he was doing.

4286
04:24:23,920 --> 04:24:25,360
Oh my god.

4287
04:24:26,980 --> 04:24:27,920
I'm gonna punch you.

4288
04:24:28,020 --> 04:24:29,100
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

4289
04:24:29,300 --> 04:24:30,360
I'm gonna...

4290
04:24:30,360 --> 04:24:31,020
Never mind.

4291
04:24:31,080 --> 04:24:32,520
You're gonna stab me in the stomach.

4292
04:24:33,300 --> 04:24:34,780
It was literally the cutscene.

4293
04:24:36,360 --> 04:24:37,360
We are literally...

4294
04:24:42,070 --> 04:24:43,610
Guys, I don't know about this one.

4295
04:24:43,690 --> 04:24:44,930
I'm truly honest.

4296
04:24:45,930 --> 04:24:49,830
You know how some fights are tough and you're just like, I think I can get the hang of this eventually.

4297
04:24:59,130 --> 04:24:59,850
You bastard.

4298
04:25:00,530 --> 04:25:01,670
You knew I was doing that.

4299
04:25:05,010 --> 04:25:06,330
You knew I was doing that.

4300
04:25:07,070 --> 04:25:07,750
Oh, wait.

4301
04:25:07,870 --> 04:25:08,970
I switched to Beowulf.

4302
04:25:12,530 --> 04:25:14,590
Can you parry with Beowulf?

4303
04:25:18,230 --> 04:25:19,690
I can't... Guys.

4304
04:25:20,310 --> 04:25:22,870
Guys, I don't know about this fight.

4305
04:25:24,970 --> 04:25:26,210
I don't know.

4306
04:25:26,810 --> 04:25:28,210
I don't know about this one.

4307
04:25:28,330 --> 04:25:29,510
I don't know about this one.

4308
04:25:29,810 --> 04:25:31,050
I don't know about this one.

4309
04:25:58,960 --> 04:25:59,880
Oh shit.

4310
04:26:00,300 --> 04:26:00,620
No!

4311
04:26:04,320 --> 04:26:05,620
Why are you saying that?

4312
04:26:14,400 --> 04:26:16,520
I'm so afraid for phase 2.

4313
04:26:21,140 --> 04:26:22,160
Here it is.

4314
04:26:22,420 --> 04:26:23,120
My death!

4315
04:26:29,000 --> 04:26:29,520
Oh...

4316
04:26:39,050 --> 04:26:39,910
What the hell?

4317
04:26:40,310 --> 04:26:41,150
When did he do that?

4318
04:27:02,870 --> 04:27:04,930
He's standing there menacingly.

4319
04:27:05,270 --> 04:27:06,390
Ah, the water!

4320
04:27:10,990 --> 04:27:11,370
The hell?

4321
04:27:11,730 --> 04:27:14,150
Okay, the shooting does not...

4322
04:27:15,070 --> 04:27:18,590
The shooting doesn't do as much as I would have liked it to.

4323
04:27:19,950 --> 04:27:20,850
Oh my god.

4324
04:27:20,850 --> 04:27:21,850
Oh my god.

4325
04:27:28,160 --> 04:27:29,780
Oh, this is it.

4326
04:27:31,500 --> 04:27:32,900
I shot too late!

4327
04:27:33,040 --> 04:27:34,580
I shot as soon as he threw it!

4328
04:27:37,840 --> 04:27:40,660
The music is just a little bit like Sephiroth's theme.

4329
04:27:43,780 --> 04:27:44,460
So what?

4330
04:27:44,500 --> 04:27:44,800
ABS?

4331
04:27:45,040 --> 04:27:45,680
Always be shooting?

4332
04:27:46,120 --> 04:27:46,500
Ouch.

4333
04:27:58,540 --> 04:27:59,100
Got

4334
04:28:06,420 --> 04:28:07,640
the combo on him, baby!

4335
04:28:22,540 --> 04:28:24,980
Oh, I stopped shooting, but not in time.

4336
04:28:28,940 --> 04:28:30,140
Gotta be so soon.

4337
04:28:30,500 --> 04:28:31,380
Oh no, again?

4338
04:28:33,160 --> 04:28:33,720
Already?

4339
04:28:37,220 --> 04:28:38,800
Oh my god!

4340
04:28:57,750 --> 04:28:58,230
Ah...

4341
04:28:58,230 --> 04:28:59,310
Anime finish for real.

4342
04:29:11,950 --> 04:29:13,590
Oh, come on!

4343
04:29:13,830 --> 04:29:14,350
Come on!

4344
04:29:14,550 --> 04:29:15,630
I hate you so much.

4345
04:29:16,010 --> 04:29:17,770
Virgil, we were so cool together.

4346
04:29:17,970 --> 04:29:18,430
What happened?

4347
04:29:19,950 --> 04:29:20,670
What happened?

4348
04:29:31,330 --> 04:29:33,690
Why do you get to hit me and I don't get to hit you?

4349
04:29:35,210 --> 04:29:35,570
Unfair.

4350
04:29:43,130 --> 04:29:45,010
I feel like he is about to throw the sword.

4351
04:29:45,610 --> 04:29:46,430
Yep, I knew it.

4352
04:29:49,510 --> 04:29:50,150
Oh my god!

4353
04:29:50,370 --> 04:29:50,590
No!

4354
04:29:51,090 --> 04:29:51,450
Fine!

4355
04:29:51,590 --> 04:29:51,870
Me too!

4356
04:29:57,320 --> 04:29:57,860
Where are you?

4357
04:29:58,020 --> 04:29:58,460
Where did you go?

4358
04:29:59,840 --> 04:30:00,680
Yeah, where did you go?

4359
04:30:01,000 --> 04:30:01,380
Come here!

4360
04:30:02,960 --> 04:30:03,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4361
04:30:13,720 --> 04:30:14,460
Are you gonna shoot it?

4362
04:30:14,520 --> 04:30:14,660
Yep.

4363
04:30:27,440 --> 04:30:29,840
I did not even see you come over here.

4364
04:30:32,160 --> 04:30:32,880
What are you gonna do?

4365
04:30:37,860 --> 04:30:39,060
Oh my god!

4366
04:30:42,100 --> 04:30:43,000
Oh shit.

4367
04:30:44,600 --> 04:30:45,720
I can't.

4368
04:30:45,760 --> 04:30:49,020
Oh, I don't have enough DT and I got caught in his combo loop.

4369
04:30:49,860 --> 04:30:50,420
No!

4370
04:30:53,000 --> 04:30:53,960
Oh god.

4371
04:30:54,140 --> 04:30:54,620
Oh no!

4372
04:30:55,340 --> 04:30:56,100
Ok, now I can.

4373
04:31:00,380 --> 04:31:01,340
Oh my god.

4374
04:31:06,420 --> 04:31:06,980
Scum!

4375
04:31:10,740 --> 04:31:11,380
Now!

4376
04:31:11,660 --> 04:31:12,800
Oh, now you are motivated.

4377
04:31:12,960 --> 04:31:14,140
Ok, buddy.

4378
04:31:15,060 --> 04:31:15,680
Ok, guy.

4379
04:31:17,560 --> 04:31:18,720
Damn it.

4380
04:31:36,310 --> 04:31:38,190
This guy sucks so bad.

4381
04:31:38,910 --> 04:31:41,130
Oh guys, I don't know what to say.

4382
04:32:07,170 --> 04:32:08,610
Oh, there we go.

4383
04:32:13,050 --> 04:32:13,510
Hmm.

4384
04:32:22,750 --> 04:32:24,930
It's really easy to get him after that.

4385
04:32:32,860 --> 04:32:33,320
Oh!

4386
04:32:34,020 --> 04:32:35,420
Oh my god, why did I shoot?

4387
04:32:36,280 --> 04:32:37,260
I'm a big old dummy.

4388
04:32:42,160 --> 04:32:42,780
Oh shit.

4389
04:32:43,420 --> 04:32:45,040
Oh, it's so scary being close to him.

4390
04:32:48,280 --> 04:32:48,820
Damn it!

4391
04:32:49,060 --> 04:32:49,960
Oh my god!

4392
04:32:52,750 --> 04:32:54,490
We are such brothers.

4393
04:33:02,170 --> 04:33:03,050
Scum!

4394
04:33:07,050 --> 04:33:09,050
Oh my god!

4395
04:33:16,020 --> 04:33:16,900
Scum!

4396
04:33:20,020 --> 04:33:22,340
He can get a hit, but not me!

4397
04:33:27,020 --> 04:33:29,520
Hardest boss in all DFC games?

4398
04:33:30,160 --> 04:33:32,700
Five hours?!

4399
04:33:32,700 --> 04:33:34,040
I wanna go home.

4400
04:33:34,460 --> 04:33:35,840
I wanna go home.

4401
04:33:35,940 --> 04:33:37,020
I don't wanna play anymore.

4402
04:33:37,980 --> 04:33:39,920
Can I just watch a cutscene and say I did it?

4403
04:33:40,480 --> 04:33:41,040
God.

4404
04:33:41,640 --> 04:33:42,560
Good lord.

4405
04:33:50,040 --> 04:33:52,600
I can't even get him to halfway health.

4406
04:33:52,600 --> 04:33:53,300
What is this?

4407
04:33:59,120 --> 04:34:01,380
How do you dodge that?

4408
04:34:02,080 --> 04:34:03,600
Maybe the double...

4409
04:34:05,240 --> 04:34:06,860
No, not even with that.

4410
04:34:07,740 --> 04:34:10,140
Unless I just stand there and time it correctly.

4411
04:34:10,720 --> 04:34:11,360
Let me see.

4412
04:34:23,280 --> 04:34:25,800
I can barely get a hit into him though.

4413
04:34:26,800 --> 04:34:28,460
Oh shit.

4414
04:34:28,840 --> 04:34:32,040
At least it doesn't do a ton of damage.

4415
04:34:43,220 --> 04:34:45,320
Too late.

4416
04:34:49,740 --> 04:34:51,140
Scum!

4417
04:35:10,650 --> 04:35:14,010
Why do you also have the double trigger at the same time as me, you copycat?

4418
04:35:17,150 --> 04:35:19,310
You're a copycat, you know that?

4419
04:35:19,710 --> 04:35:34,130
Oh my

4420
04:35:39,340 --> 04:35:42,000
god, even when I dodge that way...

4421
04:35:42,000 --> 04:35:43,340
This guy is impossible!

4422
04:35:54,520 --> 04:35:56,420
This might be fun.

4423
04:36:04,590 --> 04:36:07,010
I messed up.

4424
04:36:16,250 --> 04:36:18,630
Oh my god.

4425
04:36:24,010 --> 04:36:25,130
Oh my god.

4426
04:36:25,130 --> 04:36:25,350
Damn it.

4427
04:36:30,690 --> 04:36:32,030
Here we go, we're dead.

4428
04:36:32,830 --> 04:36:33,590
I couldn't get out.

4429
04:36:34,430 --> 04:36:36,650
I couldn't get out of the cycle.

4430
04:36:37,870 --> 04:36:38,670
I got trapped.

4431
04:36:38,950 --> 04:36:39,590
I couldn't move.

4432
04:36:47,750 --> 04:36:50,910
I kind of want to only use the vital scars once...

4433
04:36:51,690 --> 04:36:54,290
I don't have scars from this battle for real.

4434
04:36:54,590 --> 04:36:57,410
But once I learn his patterns a little bit more.

4435
04:36:57,510 --> 04:36:59,010
Once I feel a little bit more confident.

4436
04:37:00,350 --> 04:37:02,510
See, I get trapped into stuff like this.

4437
04:37:02,650 --> 04:37:05,670
What's the point of me healing if I'm just going to get trapped in it again, you know what I mean?

4438
04:37:11,050 --> 04:37:12,730
I don't know how to avoid that.

4439
04:37:12,870 --> 04:37:14,530
That, I don't know how to avoid that.

4440
04:37:15,070 --> 04:37:17,210
Because I even tried, I did like...

4441
04:37:17,210 --> 04:37:19,870
Oh my god, I did this and I couldn't get out of it.

4442
04:37:20,170 --> 04:37:21,450
Because he followed me.

4443
04:37:24,350 --> 04:37:25,510
I'm too slow.

4444
04:37:26,830 --> 04:37:28,690
Everything sucks by jumping.

4445
04:37:28,830 --> 04:37:30,310
Yeah, I definitely did that.

4446
04:37:31,610 --> 04:37:34,650
Yeah, I did that and he still got me.

4447
04:37:37,290 --> 04:37:38,810
Yeah, I did that.

4448
04:37:41,590 --> 04:37:44,730
I don't think it's very helpful if you just say, you know, you just jump.

4449
04:37:45,070 --> 04:37:46,430
Because it's, you know what I mean?

4450
04:37:46,470 --> 04:37:51,050
I have to do that, but it's like the timing of it all is just...

4451
04:37:55,230 --> 04:37:57,570
I'm so angry right now.

4452
04:37:58,950 --> 04:38:00,510
And then you can't get out of that.

4453
04:38:00,710 --> 04:38:02,390
That is so...

4454
04:38:02,390 --> 04:38:04,410
This is the worst combo to be stuck in.

4455
04:38:04,510 --> 04:38:06,410
Because how, you can't get out of it.

4456
04:38:06,890 --> 04:38:09,050
You just have to find yourself not in it.

4457
04:38:09,050 --> 04:38:10,230
Or else...

4458
04:38:10,230 --> 04:38:11,510
Or else you...

4459
04:38:11,510 --> 04:38:12,490
Oh my god.

4460
04:38:21,680 --> 04:38:24,700
Sorry, I'm like not really paying attention anymore, so...

4461
04:38:25,860 --> 04:38:28,400
I'm not really like fighting at the moment.

4462
04:38:28,900 --> 04:38:31,960
Kind of taking a break, but I'm mashing buttons as I do.

4463
04:38:48,550 --> 04:38:49,590
We can...

4464
04:38:49,590 --> 04:38:53,710
If I end, we could buy the holy water instead, maybe.

4465
04:38:55,070 --> 04:38:57,230
Jump away as soon as he lands, double jump.

4466
04:38:58,790 --> 04:39:00,310
Let me try one more time.

4467
04:39:09,280 --> 04:39:09,860
Wrong one.

4468
04:39:10,120 --> 04:39:10,980
I thought he was throwing it.

4469
04:39:14,000 --> 04:39:14,800
God damn!

4470
04:39:15,380 --> 04:39:15,780
Almost.

4471
04:39:18,480 --> 04:39:20,180
I thought I was stingering.

4472
04:39:20,520 --> 04:39:21,860
Oh, I'm on the wrong weapon!

4473
04:39:28,560 --> 04:39:30,380
Yeah, you get to hit me and I don't.

4474
04:39:30,480 --> 04:39:32,180
It's so unfair, you little bitch.

4475
04:39:32,880 --> 04:39:33,400
Fuck you.

4476
04:39:33,740 --> 04:39:34,900
You are so annoying.

4477
04:39:35,400 --> 04:39:36,820
Fuck you, Virgil!

4478
04:39:37,240 --> 04:39:39,480
Your nasal stupid ass voice.

4479
04:39:47,210 --> 04:39:49,450
I get a hit and he immediately...

4480
04:39:50,450 --> 04:39:53,230
I get a hit and he immediately combos me.

4481
04:39:53,390 --> 04:39:54,190
That's impossible.

4482
04:39:57,730 --> 04:39:58,630
Fuck you.

4483
04:39:58,810 --> 04:40:00,730
I always forget he does the jump.

4484
04:40:00,730 --> 04:40:03,490
The land, and then he...

4485
04:40:07,370 --> 04:40:11,410
And then he does a second move after it, so I'm not safe to go in.

4486
04:40:11,850 --> 04:40:12,430
Just yet!

4487
04:40:13,370 --> 04:40:15,290
Oh, wrong one.

4488
04:40:25,350 --> 04:40:27,070
And then he does another one!

4489
04:40:27,650 --> 04:40:29,330
And I have to jump out of... Yeah.

4490
04:40:37,900 --> 04:40:39,480
I hate this game.

4491
04:40:41,380 --> 04:40:43,040
I hate this game.

4492
04:40:45,520 --> 04:40:48,300
If I use my items though, I'll lose them.

4493
04:40:49,620 --> 04:40:51,980
If I use my items, I'll lose them.

4494
04:41:06,260 --> 04:41:08,420
No, I have no money to buy more.

4495
04:41:09,760 --> 04:41:12,960
I have no more money to buy more.

4496
04:41:21,960 --> 04:41:22,920
Hold on.

4497
04:41:34,160 --> 04:41:35,560
I've never seen that.

4498
04:41:35,980 --> 04:41:36,720
That's so funny.

4499
04:41:37,120 --> 04:41:38,260
Rest in peace.

4500
04:41:38,940 --> 04:41:40,500
More like rest in piss.

4501
04:41:40,860 --> 04:41:41,780
Stupid ass game.

4502
04:41:44,540 --> 04:41:44,840
This one.

4503
04:41:55,150 --> 04:41:56,610
What do I have?

4504
04:41:56,770 --> 04:41:57,070
Let's see.

4505
04:42:01,410 --> 04:42:04,010
Holy water is so expensive!

4506
04:42:07,150 --> 04:42:08,390
I can only buy two.

4507
04:42:11,270 --> 04:42:12,630
I don't think it's worth it then.

4508
04:42:14,310 --> 04:42:15,570
I don't think it's worth it then.

4509
04:42:18,450 --> 04:42:19,630
How much is the gorb?

4510
04:42:22,290 --> 04:42:23,550
Gorbs are also so expensive.

4511
04:42:23,630 --> 04:42:24,890
I would only be able to buy two.

4512
04:42:35,520 --> 04:42:35,760
Anyway.

4513
04:42:46,940 --> 04:42:47,600
Oh my god.

4514
04:42:47,700 --> 04:42:48,060
Oh my god.

4515
04:42:48,200 --> 04:42:48,620
Get me out of here.

4516
04:42:48,760 --> 04:42:49,200
Get me out of here.

4517
04:42:52,760 --> 04:42:53,380
Get me out of here!

4518
04:43:06,380 --> 04:43:07,300
I'll just reload.

4519
04:43:08,060 --> 04:43:08,720
I'll just reload!

4520
04:43:13,180 --> 04:43:13,580
Yikes.

4521
04:43:14,100 --> 04:43:15,960
That did not do as much as I thought it would.

4522
04:43:16,740 --> 04:43:17,440
That kind of sucked.

4523
04:43:18,000 --> 04:43:19,680
That's kind of not great.

4524
04:43:26,550 --> 04:43:27,990
Oh, he's also a devil tricker.

4525
04:43:31,850 --> 04:43:33,430
Nah, it's not really worth it I think.

4526
04:43:34,530 --> 04:43:35,150
I'll try again.

4527
04:43:36,590 --> 04:43:38,290
How does it work when he's...

4528
04:43:39,070 --> 04:43:39,630
What the?

4529
04:43:39,730 --> 04:43:40,570
Did it do any damage?

4530
04:43:42,090 --> 04:43:43,790
Or am I just silly?

4531
04:43:48,390 --> 04:43:49,090
It did?

4532
04:43:49,210 --> 04:43:49,490
Okay.

4533
04:43:49,770 --> 04:43:50,190
I didn't see.

4534
04:43:51,190 --> 04:43:51,670
No!

4535
04:43:51,810 --> 04:43:52,410
Oh my god.

4536
04:43:52,770 --> 04:43:53,670
Oh my god.

4537
04:43:53,810 --> 04:43:55,070
I hate when it...

4538
04:44:09,740 --> 04:44:11,240
Now I'm hollowing.

4539
04:44:12,720 --> 04:44:14,720
I'm gonna jump out of your stupid ass combo.

4540
04:44:17,180 --> 04:44:17,380
Ugh.

4541
04:44:28,900 --> 04:44:31,700
Oh shit.

4542
04:44:42,820 --> 04:44:44,960
Had a feeling he would.

4543
04:45:08,900 --> 04:45:11,700
Not yet.

4544
04:45:13,660 --> 04:45:14,500
Not yet.

4545
04:45:21,940 --> 04:45:22,380
Okay.

4546
04:45:27,420 --> 04:45:27,620
Sorry.

4547
04:45:27,860 --> 04:45:29,160
I'm gathering my senses.

4548
04:45:30,620 --> 04:45:31,940
I'm gathering my senses.

4549
04:45:36,360 --> 04:45:37,660
Trickster, air dash.

4550
04:45:38,440 --> 04:45:42,020
Wait, with trickster you can air dash so you can move out of the way faster.

4551
04:45:42,300 --> 04:45:44,480
Also dashing to the side a bit better to dodge.

4552
04:45:44,780 --> 04:45:46,000
Yeah, I know I can air dash.

4553
04:45:48,020 --> 04:45:50,000
Sometimes it wouldn't work.

4554
04:45:50,380 --> 04:45:51,800
That's probably just a skill issue.

4555
04:45:52,100 --> 04:45:52,960
Sorry for backseating.

4556
04:45:53,060 --> 04:45:53,540
It's okay.

4557
04:45:54,220 --> 04:45:55,240
Thanks for apologizing.

4558
04:45:59,120 --> 04:46:00,220
So just run?

4559
04:46:00,340 --> 04:46:00,920
Just run?

4560
04:46:02,140 --> 04:46:03,640
Should I devil trigger for this?

4561
04:46:08,100 --> 04:46:08,560
Sorry.

4562
04:46:08,780 --> 04:46:09,260
Oh gosh.

4563
04:46:10,720 --> 04:46:11,540
I'm scared.

4564
04:46:11,720 --> 04:46:14,320
I'm scared because I don't know what this is and I'm doing so well.

4565
04:46:16,620 --> 04:46:17,520
DT ride.

4566
04:46:17,960 --> 04:46:18,260
Okay.

4567
04:46:58,260 --> 04:46:58,940
Oh shit.

4568
04:47:06,770 --> 04:47:07,830
What the hell is this?

4569
04:47:13,640 --> 04:47:14,140
Okay.

4570
04:47:22,230 --> 04:47:22,910
Triggered again.

4571
04:47:23,010 --> 04:47:23,450
Okay, me too.

4572
04:47:24,830 --> 04:47:25,750
Me too, me too.

4573
04:47:32,120 --> 04:47:32,440
Shit.

4574
04:47:32,680 --> 04:47:32,960
No!

4575
04:47:34,260 --> 04:47:34,820
Oh my god.

4576
04:47:34,900 --> 04:47:35,740
Oh my god.

4577
04:47:45,000 --> 04:47:45,640
Use item.

4578
04:47:45,700 --> 04:47:47,020
You guys don't have to tell me twice.

4579
04:47:48,100 --> 04:47:49,660
You guys don't have to tell me twice.

4580
04:47:49,660 --> 04:47:49,840
What is this?

4581
04:47:59,400 --> 04:47:59,860
Spam.

4582
04:48:04,920 --> 04:48:06,040
Oh, is this it?

4583
04:48:06,460 --> 04:48:07,270
Is this where I just...

4584
04:48:08,840 --> 04:48:09,520
Oh god.

4585
04:48:10,460 --> 04:48:10,920
Okay.

4586
04:48:12,700 --> 04:48:14,460
I didn't need to devil trigger for that.

4587
04:48:17,000 --> 04:48:18,140
Okay, maybe I didn't.

4588
04:48:52,380 --> 04:48:54,120
Oh my god!

4589
04:48:54,360 --> 04:48:55,680
We did it!

4590
04:49:02,100 --> 04:49:03,060
Holy water.

4591
04:49:03,080 --> 04:49:04,600
Oh my god, it was the triple combo.

4592
04:49:04,780 --> 04:49:07,620
The holy water, the devil star, the vital star, everything.

4593
04:49:08,140 --> 04:49:08,940
I needed it all.

4594
04:49:10,260 --> 04:49:11,120
Oh my god.

4595
04:49:15,080 --> 04:49:16,420
I'm gonna take a cough drop.

4596
04:49:16,420 --> 04:49:16,600
Thank you.

4597
04:49:19,360 --> 04:49:20,780
There's no phase two, right?

4598
04:49:23,060 --> 04:49:24,380
That's it, right?

4599
04:49:29,120 --> 04:49:30,240
Oh my god.

4600
04:49:30,620 --> 04:49:31,460
I wish... No.

4601
04:49:32,920 --> 04:49:34,200
Don't say that!

4602
04:49:44,140 --> 04:49:44,980
There

4603
04:49:49,330 --> 04:49:51,070
are five phases.

4604
04:49:53,130 --> 04:49:56,590
Imagine if everyone else was gaslighting me and that one person was correct.

4605
04:49:58,630 --> 04:50:00,910
Oh, Virgil, with your nasty gloves.

4606
04:50:01,090 --> 04:50:02,310
Why are they skin colored?

4607
04:50:02,470 --> 04:50:03,250
They're so horrible.

4608
04:50:06,030 --> 04:50:08,190
They look like you have wrinkly old hands.

4609
04:50:12,050 --> 04:50:12,550
Pick me!

4610
04:50:12,650 --> 04:50:13,210
Thank you for that!

4611
04:50:13,290 --> 04:50:13,750
I'm super!

4612
04:50:17,970 --> 04:50:19,650
I feel so fulfilled.

4613
04:50:21,670 --> 04:50:22,650
I'm staying.

4614
04:50:23,850 --> 04:50:26,770
This place is our father's home.

4615
04:50:27,730 --> 04:50:28,310
Snake!

4616
04:50:31,930 --> 04:50:33,290
Oh my god.

4617
04:50:35,010 --> 04:50:35,990
Shoot him!

4618
04:50:36,110 --> 04:50:36,410
Shoot him!

4619
04:50:36,910 --> 04:50:37,910
Just like with Ocelot.

4620
04:50:40,830 --> 04:50:41,710
Our brother.

4621
04:50:42,570 --> 04:50:45,150
Our brother, Virgil, no!

4622
04:50:46,890 --> 04:50:48,490
He left us the sword.

4623
04:50:48,530 --> 04:50:50,390
He was even smiling as he fell.

4624
04:51:06,910 --> 04:51:07,870
He's so sad.

4625
04:51:09,250 --> 04:51:10,550
Oh, our brother.

4626
04:51:13,310 --> 04:51:15,530
The sword is what becomes the Sparta sword in one.

4627
04:51:17,270 --> 04:51:18,950
Yeah, I think some people said that earlier.

4628
04:51:21,650 --> 04:51:22,610
For real.

4629
04:51:28,010 --> 04:51:29,170
Yeah, I was on loan.

4630
04:51:29,310 --> 04:51:30,190
It was not for keepies.

4631
04:51:36,490 --> 04:51:37,270
Ladies fun.

4632
04:51:37,630 --> 04:51:38,690
Then she got what she wanted.

4633
04:51:38,770 --> 04:51:39,730
She got to kill her dad.

4634
04:51:40,590 --> 04:51:43,450
And, you know, we took care of the hard part.

4635
04:51:46,610 --> 04:51:48,950
And now the city is destroyed.

4636
04:51:49,350 --> 04:51:51,330
There's like a little car in the building.

4637
04:51:51,890 --> 04:51:52,670
We should be fine.

4638
04:51:53,070 --> 04:51:53,450
Whatever.

4639
04:51:53,990 --> 04:51:54,790
We should be fine.

4640
04:51:54,910 --> 04:51:56,670
The rest of the population...

4641
04:52:04,550 --> 04:52:05,670
It's only the rain.

4642
04:52:14,700 --> 04:52:16,000
Let me see his crying...

4643
04:52:17,920 --> 04:52:20,040
Let me see his crying face.

4644
04:52:20,760 --> 04:52:22,360
Let me see him cry like a baby.

4645
04:52:22,720 --> 04:52:25,660
Maybe somewhere out there even the devil may cry when he loses a loved one.

4646
04:52:26,960 --> 04:52:27,600
Don't you think?

4647
04:52:29,820 --> 04:52:30,300
Maybe.

4648
04:52:30,740 --> 04:52:31,820
He said the title.

4649
04:52:34,680 --> 04:52:36,180
By the way...

4650
04:52:37,580 --> 04:52:38,980
No way.

4651
04:52:39,600 --> 04:52:41,060
Never a moment's rest.

4652
04:52:42,400 --> 04:52:46,460
We are on clean up duty.

4653
04:52:49,040 --> 04:52:51,960
Bring it on baby!

4654
04:52:52,520 --> 04:52:53,480
Except not for me.

4655
04:53:00,860 --> 04:53:02,500
Ebony and Ivory baby!

4656
04:53:07,520 --> 04:53:09,380
Oh, I'm still going.

4657
04:53:12,220 --> 04:53:14,020
Oh my god.

4658
04:53:14,280 --> 04:53:14,900
Interactive.

4659
04:53:15,860 --> 04:53:17,280
Interactive credit scene.

4660
04:53:17,460 --> 04:53:18,120
Let's go!

4661
04:53:18,980 --> 04:53:20,460
And we are fighting with lady!

4662
04:53:22,160 --> 04:53:22,560
Yeah!

4663
04:53:38,860 --> 04:53:39,260
OK.

4664
04:53:40,640 --> 04:53:44,020
I know I said I hate this game a million times, but it was actually pretty fun.

4665
04:53:49,210 --> 04:53:50,010
That's right.

4666
04:53:52,150 --> 04:53:52,870
What was it?

4667
04:53:53,090 --> 04:53:53,150
Hit.

4668
04:53:53,350 --> 04:53:53,550
Hit.

4669
04:53:53,750 --> 04:53:53,990
Hit.

4670
04:53:54,030 --> 04:53:54,070
Hit.

4671
04:53:54,170 --> 04:53:54,250
Hit.

4672
04:53:54,730 --> 04:53:55,130
Hit.

4673
04:53:55,630 --> 04:53:55,830
Hit.

4674
04:53:55,830 --> 04:53:56,030
Hit.

4675
04:53:56,510 --> 04:53:56,910
Hit.

4676
04:53:57,150 --> 04:53:57,150
Hit.

4677
04:53:57,350 --> 04:53:57,610
Hit.

4678
04:53:57,670 --> 04:53:57,710
Hit.

4679
04:53:57,830 --> 04:53:57,950
Hit.

4680
04:54:15,640 --> 04:54:17,120
I can also shoot.

4681
04:54:17,460 --> 04:54:18,540
I can also shoot.

4682
04:54:21,480 --> 04:54:22,720
Oh, she got it.

4683
04:54:23,200 --> 04:54:24,020
She took my kill.

4684
04:54:25,340 --> 04:54:26,420
Oh my god.

4685
04:54:26,520 --> 04:54:27,140
This is crazy.

4686
04:54:27,780 --> 04:54:29,800
Can you even get hurt in this fight?

4687
04:54:30,980 --> 04:54:34,160
Is it just punching and kicking and everything?

4688
04:54:35,240 --> 04:54:36,600
It's what everybody wants.

4689
04:54:42,600 --> 04:54:44,940
You cannot hurt me.

4690
04:54:45,920 --> 04:54:46,440
Dummy!

4691
04:54:47,460 --> 04:54:49,540
I'm too strong now!

4692
04:54:52,720 --> 04:54:54,120
This is the game on easy mode.

4693
04:54:54,740 --> 04:54:56,740
And I didn't play it on easy mode.

4694
04:54:56,800 --> 04:54:57,740
Aren't you guys proud of me?

4695
04:54:58,580 --> 04:55:00,100
I played this game on normal.

4696
04:55:01,020 --> 04:55:02,520
And it's such a difficult game.

4697
04:55:03,640 --> 04:55:04,580
Are you proud of me?

4698
04:55:12,580 --> 04:55:13,260
Praise me!

4699
04:55:14,400 --> 04:55:15,480
Praise me mode!

4700
04:55:18,480 --> 04:55:19,220
Oh wait.

4701
04:55:19,360 --> 04:55:19,520
Oh.

4702
04:55:20,540 --> 04:55:21,340
I can change.

4703
04:55:21,400 --> 04:55:22,580
It just doesn't show the interface.

4704
04:55:26,230 --> 04:55:29,430
Let's finish with a rebellion.

4705
04:55:30,930 --> 04:55:32,030
Since that's our baby.

4706
04:55:37,030 --> 04:55:37,470
Oh wait.

4707
04:55:38,870 --> 04:55:39,730
There we go.

4708
04:55:40,810 --> 04:55:41,270
There we go.

4709
04:55:44,810 --> 04:55:45,870
Shield time!

4710
04:55:48,210 --> 04:55:48,890
Oh.

4711
04:55:49,150 --> 04:55:51,010
I just... I don't know why I did that.

4712
04:55:51,830 --> 04:55:52,370
There we go.

4713
04:55:52,870 --> 04:55:53,190
OK.

4714
04:55:53,810 --> 04:55:54,670
And yeah!

4715
04:55:55,950 --> 04:55:56,630
80?

4716
04:55:56,910 --> 04:55:57,550
81?

4717
04:55:59,450 --> 04:56:02,050
Can we get to 100 before the credits end?

4718
04:56:03,610 --> 04:56:04,290
Die?

4719
04:56:06,480 --> 04:56:06,920
Yeah.

4720
04:56:07,080 --> 04:56:07,360
Nice.

4721
04:56:08,120 --> 04:56:08,660
Nice!

4722
04:56:16,880 --> 04:56:17,840
Come on!

4723
04:56:18,520 --> 04:56:19,340
Special thanks!

4724
04:56:19,640 --> 04:56:20,100
Oh god!

4725
04:56:20,760 --> 04:56:21,420
Oh god!

4726
04:56:21,420 --> 04:56:21,520
100!

4727
04:56:21,740 --> 04:56:22,420
90!

4728
04:56:24,920 --> 04:56:25,600
94!

4729
04:56:27,800 --> 04:56:28,980
We are almost there!

4730
04:56:33,100 --> 04:56:33,780
97!

4731
04:56:35,320 --> 04:56:36,500
Oh my god.

4732
04:56:36,840 --> 04:56:37,520
My trauma.

4733
04:56:39,100 --> 04:56:40,460
This is so evil.

4734
04:56:47,210 --> 04:56:49,010
This is the 99th.

4735
04:56:49,010 --> 04:56:49,550
Oh my god.

4736
04:56:49,590 --> 04:56:50,030
No way.

4737
04:56:53,730 --> 04:56:54,610
For

4738
04:56:58,760 --> 04:56:59,080
me!

4739
04:56:59,520 --> 04:57:00,520
So close.

4740
04:57:03,140 --> 04:57:04,800
We were so close.

4741
04:57:08,480 --> 04:57:10,420
He cleans up so nice.

4742
04:57:11,320 --> 04:57:11,760
Nice.

4743
04:57:18,920 --> 04:57:25,420
Thanks for playing DMC3 and congratulations on making it to the credits.

4744
04:57:25,660 --> 04:57:26,220
Thank you!

4745
04:57:37,900 --> 04:57:38,420
What?

4746
04:57:38,500 --> 04:57:38,680
What's that?

4747
04:57:38,940 --> 04:57:40,000
Oh mom!

4748
04:57:46,700 --> 04:57:48,100
Oh my god.

4749
04:57:48,220 --> 04:57:49,300
Devil May Cry baby!

4750
04:57:51,900 --> 04:57:52,480
Crazy!

4751
04:57:57,600 --> 04:57:58,820
He's so stylish.

4752
04:57:58,940 --> 04:57:59,420
I know, right?

4753
04:58:13,140 --> 04:58:14,300
Wow guys.

4754
04:58:14,360 --> 04:58:16,300
I only beat Virgil in 4 minutes.

4755
04:58:16,840 --> 04:58:18,380
What's wrong with you guys?

4756
04:58:19,620 --> 04:58:21,980
It took me 4 minutes to beat Virgil.

4757
04:58:24,500 --> 04:58:26,600
Why did it take you guys so long?

4758
04:58:26,680 --> 04:58:27,300
Oh my god.

4759
04:58:29,120 --> 04:58:29,880
First try.

4760
04:58:30,020 --> 04:58:30,540
I know, right?

4761
04:58:31,120 --> 04:58:32,460
Look at all the items I used.

4762
04:58:32,540 --> 04:58:33,320
Put me down to a D.

4763
04:58:36,100 --> 04:58:37,000
Oh my gosh.

4764
04:58:37,600 --> 04:58:38,780
We hit every rank.

4765
04:58:39,080 --> 04:58:40,640
A, B, C, D.

4766
04:58:40,740 --> 04:58:40,880
Wait.

4767
04:58:41,000 --> 04:58:42,700
S, A, B, C, D.

4768
04:58:44,000 --> 04:58:48,320
We got every single rank you could get in this one.

4769
04:58:48,760 --> 04:58:50,560
Imagine how salty Virgil must feel.

4770
04:58:51,120 --> 04:58:54,920
All those fancy sword moves and Dante just punched him in the gut over and over again.

4771
04:58:55,020 --> 04:58:55,560
I know, right?

4772
04:58:59,140 --> 04:59:00,600
Congratulations on beating 3 minutes.

4773
04:59:00,700 --> 04:59:02,420
Also, remember Raiden in MGS2?

4774
04:59:03,160 --> 04:59:05,480
We're gonna have that situation again in DMC4.

4775
04:59:06,000 --> 04:59:06,440
Don't worry.

4776
04:59:06,520 --> 04:59:07,320
This is not a spoiler.

4777
04:59:08,360 --> 04:59:08,860
Wait.

4778
04:59:08,960 --> 04:59:11,960
People didn't think that Dante was very cool?

4779
04:59:17,620 --> 04:59:21,160
Or is it that you thought you were gonna play as Dante and then you play as someone else?

4780
04:59:25,330 --> 04:59:25,910
Oh wait.

4781
04:59:25,990 --> 04:59:26,150
No.

4782
04:59:26,830 --> 04:59:27,270
MGS4.

4783
04:59:30,030 --> 04:59:30,470
Oh.

4784
04:59:30,590 --> 04:59:31,670
It is a spoiler though.

4785
04:59:32,210 --> 04:59:36,690
I guess it depends on what you define as a spoiler.

4786
04:59:37,270 --> 04:59:37,510
Maybe.

4787
04:59:38,830 --> 04:59:39,210
Anyway.

4788
04:59:56,510 --> 04:59:57,030
A.

4789
04:59:59,810 --> 05:00:03,770
I graduated school with these grades.

4790
05:00:04,610 --> 05:00:05,710
I'm not a straight A student.

4791
05:00:06,290 --> 05:00:07,850
In fact, I never even got a single A.

4792
05:00:09,710 --> 05:00:10,230
But...

4793
05:00:10,870 --> 05:00:12,170
But that doesn't matter.

4794
05:00:14,310 --> 05:00:16,810
C's get degrees.

4795
05:00:21,230 --> 05:00:22,230
Congratulations.

4796
05:00:22,770 --> 05:00:24,970
I do hate being considered normal.

4797
05:00:26,690 --> 05:00:29,530
Look at Beowulf right there.

4798
05:00:29,690 --> 05:00:30,810
Right in the center.

4799
05:00:32,070 --> 05:00:34,570
Agni and Rudra too.

4800
05:00:35,150 --> 05:00:36,530
Look at everybody.

4801
05:00:36,690 --> 05:00:37,330
Oh my gosh.

4802
05:00:37,430 --> 05:00:39,430
It's our star studded cast.

4803
05:00:40,670 --> 05:00:44,810
I kind of want to print this out and give it as a valentine's day card.

4804
05:00:46,350 --> 05:00:48,230
Why does it have that kind of energy?

4805
05:00:48,830 --> 05:00:53,450
I feel like if I were in grade school and I played this game...

4806
05:00:53,450 --> 05:00:59,890
I would have taken a picture of this and I would have passed this out as a valentine's day something.

4807
05:01:01,770 --> 05:01:04,630
Congrats on beating the game and you kicked butt today.

4808
05:01:04,730 --> 05:01:05,390
Thank you.

4809
05:01:06,150 --> 05:01:12,450
I do want to apologize again about me being so legitimately salty in the middle of the stream.

4810
05:01:14,190 --> 05:01:15,510
But I do feel better now.

4811
05:01:15,590 --> 05:01:16,650
I'm really sorry you guys.

4812
05:01:23,650 --> 05:01:27,770
I love this picture.

4813
05:01:28,010 --> 05:01:28,370
Hold on.

4814
05:01:28,530 --> 05:01:30,190
I need to screenshot this right now.

4815
05:01:31,870 --> 05:01:32,810
El gato.

4816
05:01:35,430 --> 05:01:35,910
Screenshot.

4817
05:01:36,250 --> 05:01:36,610
Oh wait.

4818
05:01:36,690 --> 05:01:37,810
I want to be in the picture.

4819
05:01:38,950 --> 05:01:39,910
I want to be in here.

4820
05:01:41,510 --> 05:01:42,850
Let me put my arms up.

4821
05:01:45,890 --> 05:01:49,410
I do hate being considered normal.

4822
05:01:53,980 --> 05:01:54,700
Oh yeah.

4823
05:01:54,920 --> 05:01:55,620
Next to Virgil.

4824
05:01:58,600 --> 05:01:59,580
How tall is he?

4825
05:02:00,780 --> 05:02:01,620
Maybe like here.

4826
05:02:02,620 --> 05:02:03,020
Oh yeah.

4827
05:02:03,160 --> 05:02:06,940
I do hate being... I do hate being considered normal.

4828
05:02:09,060 --> 05:02:13,680
I kind of want to be on top of Beowulf or next to Beowulf.

4829
05:02:13,760 --> 05:02:16,560
I'll be on top of Rudra, Agnia, whichever that one is.

4830
05:02:16,920 --> 05:02:18,220
Look at me I'm Beowulf.

4831
05:02:18,580 --> 05:02:19,800
Hey Beowulf.

4832
05:02:24,560 --> 05:02:26,780
I kind of come to love Beowulf so much.

4833
05:02:29,660 --> 05:02:31,120
I kind of come to love him.

4834
05:02:35,760 --> 05:02:36,080
Again.

4835
05:02:36,740 --> 05:02:36,900
Wait.

4836
05:02:36,980 --> 05:02:37,660
Let me take a picture.

4837
05:02:38,020 --> 05:02:38,440
Hold on.

4838
05:02:38,480 --> 05:02:39,340
I'm going to get rid of you guys.

4839
05:02:41,320 --> 05:02:42,500
Let me take a picture.

4840
05:02:49,840 --> 05:02:51,300
I'll go down here too.

4841
05:02:53,040 --> 05:02:54,380
I'll go down here too.

4842
05:02:58,720 --> 05:02:59,720
One more picture.

4843
05:03:00,040 --> 05:03:01,060
Just to make sure I got it.

4844
05:03:01,200 --> 05:03:01,320
OK.

4845
05:03:01,520 --> 05:03:01,840
Screenshot.

4846
05:03:01,960 --> 05:03:02,180
Nice.

4847
05:03:04,560 --> 05:03:04,640
Yay!

4848
05:03:09,860 --> 05:03:12,080
I love this picture so much.

4849
05:03:17,630 --> 05:03:19,350
Hard mode now selectable.

4850
05:03:19,450 --> 05:03:20,730
Gallery mode now selectable.

4851
05:03:20,970 --> 05:03:22,210
Virgil is now selectable.

4852
05:03:22,470 --> 05:03:23,670
New costume has been added.

4853
05:03:24,010 --> 05:03:24,830
Movies have been added.

4854
05:03:24,990 --> 05:03:25,970
Illustrations have been added.

4855
05:03:27,370 --> 05:03:27,930
Save.

4856
05:03:28,310 --> 05:03:28,310
Yes.

4857
05:03:29,710 --> 05:03:30,730
Oh my gosh.

4858
05:03:30,750 --> 05:03:35,050
I just noticed the key visual of lady looks so good.

4859
05:03:35,050 --> 05:03:38,130
We found this year's Wisp Christmas card.

4860
05:03:39,370 --> 05:03:41,470
Beowulf has that ugly dog energy.

4861
05:03:41,950 --> 05:03:43,110
Yeah, maybe that's it.

4862
05:03:43,630 --> 05:03:45,030
Text on this Valentine's Day card.

4863
05:03:45,130 --> 05:03:46,070
You're my motivation.

4864
05:03:46,730 --> 05:03:48,490
That's so good!

4865
05:03:48,570 --> 05:03:50,350
That's so good.

4866
05:03:50,530 --> 05:03:50,970
Wow.

4867
05:03:51,510 --> 05:03:52,770
What's in the gallery?

4868
05:03:53,670 --> 05:03:54,330
Concept art.

4869
05:03:57,430 --> 05:03:58,150
Bold!

4870
05:03:58,150 --> 05:03:58,870
Bold!

4871
05:04:00,390 --> 05:04:01,630
What else we got?

4872
05:04:04,170 --> 05:04:04,730
Oh.

4873
05:04:04,730 --> 05:04:05,290
Wow.

4874
05:04:06,930 --> 05:04:08,390
Oh my god.

4875
05:04:09,550 --> 05:04:10,110
Emo.

4876
05:04:11,250 --> 05:04:14,470
You can make like a Dante Vtuber out of this.

4877
05:04:16,370 --> 05:04:16,930
Wow!

4878
05:04:18,450 --> 05:04:19,650
Oh my god!

4879
05:04:20,370 --> 05:04:21,230
Devil Trigger.

4880
05:04:22,290 --> 05:04:25,590
I would want my Devil Trigger to look a little bit more mech.

4881
05:04:27,130 --> 05:04:27,950
I think.

4882
05:04:28,590 --> 05:04:30,870
I know that's not really the point of it, but...

4883
05:04:31,630 --> 05:04:37,490
I'm so excited for when you start DMC4 and 5 and find out that Redacted is Redacted and then you Redacted is Redacted.

4884
05:04:37,670 --> 05:04:38,050
Yeah!

4885
05:04:38,850 --> 05:04:40,970
Can't wait for all the Redactedness.

4886
05:04:42,970 --> 05:04:43,930
Oh, wow.

4887
05:04:43,990 --> 05:04:44,690
So many Virgils.

4888
05:04:45,270 --> 05:04:46,290
Virgil with a scarf?

4889
05:04:46,710 --> 05:04:47,430
Oh my god.

4890
05:04:48,290 --> 05:04:49,270
We were deprived.

4891
05:04:50,190 --> 05:04:52,690
Look, his gloves aren't flesh colored here.

4892
05:04:54,170 --> 05:04:54,710
Wow!

4893
05:04:56,770 --> 05:04:58,010
Oh my goodness.

4894
05:04:59,750 --> 05:05:01,930
This driver's license photo.

4895
05:05:02,870 --> 05:05:03,630
Lady!

4896
05:05:05,170 --> 05:05:07,790
God, she has a teeny tiny head.

4897
05:05:08,630 --> 05:05:09,390
Lady!

4898
05:05:10,470 --> 05:05:12,930
I like that they made her hair a little bit longer.

4899
05:05:14,430 --> 05:05:15,770
Oh, Vulcan.

4900
05:05:17,770 --> 05:05:18,870
This guy.

4901
05:05:19,390 --> 05:05:20,750
Completely forgot he was a thing.

4902
05:05:21,370 --> 05:05:23,790
Oh, banning my existence.

4903
05:05:25,050 --> 05:05:25,490
Oh!

4904
05:05:27,390 --> 05:05:28,770
Is that what they look like?

4905
05:05:28,770 --> 05:05:30,870
They just look like statues and then they open up.

4906
05:05:31,470 --> 05:05:32,810
I didn't know that.

4907
05:05:32,890 --> 05:05:34,610
I've only just seen them as the eyes.

4908
05:05:35,090 --> 05:05:38,330
I never realized they were actually just muscular statue men.

4909
05:05:38,710 --> 05:05:39,810
They have an eight pack.

4910
05:05:42,150 --> 05:05:44,250
This sniper has an eight pack.

4911
05:05:44,810 --> 05:05:45,410
Oh my god.

4912
05:05:45,450 --> 05:05:46,610
He could have just beat me up.

4913
05:05:49,010 --> 05:05:49,890
Oh, Cerberus.

4914
05:05:49,990 --> 05:05:51,130
I like Cerberus a lot too.

4915
05:05:51,130 --> 05:05:53,530
Wait, I didn't see Cerberus in our picture.

4916
05:05:56,150 --> 05:05:58,270
Did they always not have heads?

4917
05:05:59,110 --> 05:06:01,590
Oh, I thought that they always had a head.

4918
05:06:01,710 --> 05:06:03,330
Oh their head is on the sword.

4919
05:06:10,270 --> 05:06:15,050
Wow, this feels very Warhammer.

4920
05:06:17,350 --> 05:06:19,790
Second floor, third floor, fourth floor.

4921
05:06:21,270 --> 05:06:22,910
Are you enjoying yourself?

4922
05:06:25,130 --> 05:06:25,490
Sugar.

4923
05:06:27,170 --> 05:06:31,190
Oh, this is a great visual.

4924
05:06:31,730 --> 05:06:33,530
Wow, this is a great visual.

4925
05:06:33,530 --> 05:06:35,070
Oh my gosh, I want to buy an art book now.

4926
05:06:36,150 --> 05:06:37,690
If you get to a hundred, you get a secret ending?

4927
05:06:38,090 --> 05:06:38,890
No way, really?

4928
05:06:39,370 --> 05:06:40,590
I was so close.

4929
05:06:42,230 --> 05:06:44,030
Are you one guying me, Brandon?

4930
05:06:45,250 --> 05:06:46,850
Oh, this is a great picture too.

4931
05:06:47,550 --> 05:06:48,630
Oh, we got all the pictures.

4932
05:06:50,030 --> 05:06:51,070
Promotional video!

4933
05:06:52,370 --> 05:06:52,890
E3.

4934
05:06:54,370 --> 05:06:55,250
Oh, it's true?

4935
05:06:55,370 --> 05:06:55,770
It's real?

4936
05:06:56,030 --> 05:06:56,670
Dang it.

4937
05:06:58,610 --> 05:06:59,950
Small secret scene.

4938
05:07:00,210 --> 05:07:02,450
Is it about... Is it a show like Virgil doing something?

4939
05:07:02,690 --> 05:07:03,730
Dang, that's so annoying.

4940
05:07:17,360 --> 05:07:19,940
Kind of sad we don't have E3's anymore, right?

4941
05:07:25,140 --> 05:07:30,800
AMC3 manga kind of implies Lady is still a schoolgirl and just modified her uniform for combat.

4942
05:07:30,960 --> 05:07:31,700
That's crazy!

4943
05:07:37,710 --> 05:07:43,470
I feel like now we only see things either in directs or the game awards.

4944
05:07:46,250 --> 05:07:47,430
There's one other event.

4945
05:07:47,610 --> 05:07:48,170
I can't remember.

4946
05:07:51,030 --> 05:07:51,850
Oh, yeah.

4947
05:07:52,250 --> 05:07:52,830
Oh, yeah.

4948
05:07:53,370 --> 05:07:54,170
Oh, yeah.

4949
05:07:55,190 --> 05:07:55,890
Oh, yeah.

4950
05:07:57,470 --> 05:07:57,950
TGS?

4951
05:07:58,390 --> 05:07:59,150
No, true, true, true.

4952
05:07:59,270 --> 05:07:59,630
TGS.

4953
05:08:00,470 --> 05:08:01,950
I was thinking a western event.

4954
05:08:23,150 --> 05:08:23,630
Dante!

4955
05:08:23,830 --> 05:08:25,050
Oh my god, yes!

4956
05:08:25,410 --> 05:08:26,810
I love seeing sassy Dante.

4957
05:08:26,970 --> 05:08:29,610
Everyone probably saw this after DMC2 and was just like...

4958
05:08:29,610 --> 05:08:30,150
Look at him!

4959
05:08:30,410 --> 05:08:31,370
He's emoting!

4960
05:08:33,670 --> 05:08:35,610
Oh my god.

4961
05:08:46,810 --> 05:08:51,490
Oh my god.

4962
05:08:51,930 --> 05:08:55,070
I can see!

4963
05:08:56,470 --> 05:08:57,250
See!

4964
05:08:59,190 --> 05:09:00,950
I can see!

4965
05:09:02,390 --> 05:09:03,810
I can see!

4966
05:09:05,610 --> 05:09:06,430
I can see!

4967
05:09:16,670 --> 05:09:17,550
I

4968
05:09:21,900 --> 05:09:23,540
fought those guys.

4969
05:09:24,320 --> 05:09:25,360
Fought that guy.

4970
05:09:27,420 --> 05:09:28,780
I fought that guy.

4971
05:09:32,770 --> 05:09:33,710
Oh, yeah.

4972
05:09:34,410 --> 05:09:35,270
We were there.

4973
05:09:35,490 --> 05:09:36,870
Aerial rave!

4974
05:09:38,910 --> 05:09:39,810
Oh, yeah!

4975
05:09:40,650 --> 05:09:41,170
Fireworks!

4976
05:09:45,130 --> 05:09:45,650
Drive!

4977
05:09:50,740 --> 05:09:51,720
I never did that.

4978
05:09:51,880 --> 05:09:53,660
God, trailer Dante is so cool.

4979
05:09:53,880 --> 05:09:55,060
I'm so lame!

4980
05:10:10,440 --> 05:10:11,800
What the...

4981
05:10:14,590 --> 05:10:16,860
It looks so much like Raiden there.

4982
05:10:17,040 --> 05:10:17,540
It's scary.

4983
05:10:24,880 --> 05:10:26,800
Oh, that was cinema.

4984
05:10:27,780 --> 05:10:28,360
Cinema!

4985
05:10:29,100 --> 05:10:30,300
That was so peak.

4986
05:10:30,900 --> 05:10:31,980
Oh my god!

4987
05:10:35,320 --> 05:10:36,980
Oh my god.

4988
05:10:37,400 --> 05:10:40,220
The song is called Devil's Never Cry and it's peak edge.

4989
05:10:41,740 --> 05:10:43,280
Crazy gameplay video.

4990
05:10:43,620 --> 05:10:46,600
This video features some of the craziest Devil's Never Cry gameplay ever?

4991
05:10:51,860 --> 05:10:53,060
That's a real wolf.

4992
05:10:53,420 --> 05:10:54,220
I kicked...

4993
05:10:54,220 --> 05:10:55,480
Oh, yeah!

4994
05:10:55,580 --> 05:10:56,880
Take them both down, baby!

4995
05:11:03,120 --> 05:11:04,140
That's what I did.

4996
05:11:06,440 --> 05:11:06,960
Yeah!

4997
05:11:07,500 --> 05:11:08,080
Kick them!

4998
05:11:08,260 --> 05:11:11,910
Kick them while they're down and while they're up too.

4999
05:11:14,970 --> 05:11:15,610
Oh, my eyes.

5000
05:11:15,710 --> 05:11:16,790
Oh my god.

5001
05:11:23,490 --> 05:11:27,970
Imagine playing DMC2 back in the day being disappointed thinking I'll never come back and then see this.

5002
05:11:32,100 --> 05:11:37,320
One of the rare times that a game could come back after a terrible sequel.

5003
05:11:44,240 --> 05:11:46,220
I can imagine it being so hype.

5004
05:11:46,860 --> 05:11:49,540
Oh, I would have just run away from that room.

5005
05:11:50,680 --> 05:11:52,320
Oh my god, I can hear him saying it.

5006
05:11:52,660 --> 05:11:53,460
I can hear...

5007
05:11:53,460 --> 05:11:56,420
I heard his voice.

5008
05:12:01,220 --> 05:12:02,380
Um, excuse me?

5009
05:12:08,960 --> 05:12:10,060
What the hell was that?

5010
05:12:10,480 --> 05:12:10,920
Quicksilver.

5011
05:12:12,220 --> 05:12:13,280
I never use that.

5012
05:12:17,140 --> 05:12:18,800
Wow, clear bonus art!

5013
05:12:20,900 --> 05:12:22,060
Oh, we have...

5014
05:12:23,000 --> 05:12:23,440
Yeah!

5015
05:12:24,420 --> 05:12:25,420
Oh my gosh, we have one!

5016
05:12:25,420 --> 05:12:30,480
You guys, we have one that is textless!

5017
05:12:30,940 --> 05:12:35,300
So you can actually make a Valentine with it.

5018
05:12:35,760 --> 05:12:36,960
Valentine's Day is coming up!

5019
05:12:37,020 --> 05:12:38,400
It's in literally less than a month.

5020
05:12:40,140 --> 05:12:42,480
Which, I have some stuff on Valentine's Day.

5021
05:12:42,500 --> 05:12:45,600
Actually, I have multiple things on Valentine's Day.

5022
05:12:45,940 --> 05:12:49,180
I'm gonna hint at something else since you stayed for...

5023
05:12:49,180 --> 05:12:53,420
Since first you watched me play Devil May Cry all the way to the very end and then also...

5024
05:12:55,420 --> 05:12:57,240
Since I was a little stinker today.

5025
05:13:00,220 --> 05:13:08,660
If you are going to HoloFest, there might be some cool things to check out.

5026
05:13:11,460 --> 05:13:13,140
HoloExpo, that's what I meant.

5027
05:13:13,460 --> 05:13:15,420
Not there, but...

5028
05:13:16,440 --> 05:13:19,660
Yeah, maybe keep a day open on your schedule.

5029
05:13:22,360 --> 05:13:23,640
That's all I'll say.

5030
05:13:25,420 --> 05:13:26,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5031
05:13:29,260 --> 05:13:29,700
Yeah!

5032
05:13:34,800 --> 05:13:38,840
If you wanted to watch the Devil May Cry anime on your free time...

5033
05:13:38,840 --> 05:13:42,160
Since it released before DMC4 and is canon set between 1 and 2.

5034
05:13:42,300 --> 05:13:43,920
Oh yeah, now I can finally watch that, right?

5035
05:13:44,840 --> 05:13:45,820
What else we got?

5036
05:13:46,380 --> 05:13:48,560
The logo 15 million times.

5037
05:13:48,660 --> 05:13:50,420
Oh, these are...

5038
05:13:50,420 --> 05:13:54,300
Oh, I just realized because we haven't unlocked them yet.

5039
05:13:54,300 --> 05:13:55,240
That's so funny.

5040
05:13:57,060 --> 05:13:58,940
No, ours is peak.

5041
05:13:59,300 --> 05:14:00,240
This is peak.

5042
05:14:00,400 --> 05:14:01,380
This is the best one.

5043
05:14:01,520 --> 05:14:02,800
This is the best one we could've unlocked.

5044
05:14:03,400 --> 05:14:05,520
This is actually...

5045
05:14:05,520 --> 05:14:07,580
Beowulf looks so goofy.

5046
05:14:07,800 --> 05:14:08,420
I love it.

5047
05:14:08,580 --> 05:14:09,440
This is the best one.

5048
05:14:13,020 --> 05:14:14,100
It's so good.

5049
05:14:14,540 --> 05:14:15,300
It's so good.

5050
05:14:15,400 --> 05:14:16,820
You have the king.

5051
05:14:17,100 --> 05:14:18,840
You have the horse.

5052
05:14:19,060 --> 05:14:21,060
You have the giant whale in the background.

5053
05:14:21,780 --> 05:14:23,300
You have Cerberus.

5054
05:14:24,100 --> 05:14:27,020
You have the big glob man.

5055
05:14:27,760 --> 05:14:28,580
It's so good.

5056
05:14:29,520 --> 05:14:30,480
You beat the hardest one.

5057
05:14:30,600 --> 05:14:30,860
Don't worry.

5058
05:14:30,980 --> 05:14:32,900
DMC4 is easier and has some fun new stuff.

5059
05:14:33,020 --> 05:14:34,800
Oh, and DMC isn't actually a bad game.

5060
05:14:34,900 --> 05:14:36,160
It's an unintentional comedy.

5061
05:14:36,680 --> 05:14:38,720
No, it's amazing.

5062
05:14:39,020 --> 05:14:40,520
I don't think it's even comedy at all.

5063
05:14:41,100 --> 05:14:42,260
It's so good.

5064
05:14:42,600 --> 05:14:43,280
Oh my god.

5065
05:14:43,400 --> 05:14:43,580
OK.

5066
05:14:43,740 --> 05:14:45,360
I can't wait to start DMC4.

5067
05:14:45,760 --> 05:14:47,240
If this was the hardest one then...

5068
05:14:47,240 --> 05:14:48,920
We made it.

5069
05:14:49,240 --> 05:14:50,580
We cleared it.

5070
05:14:50,580 --> 05:14:52,900
We did it.

5071
05:14:55,340 --> 05:14:56,660
Exiting the screen without save.

5072
05:14:56,700 --> 05:14:57,380
Oh, we did save.

5073
05:14:58,560 --> 05:14:59,680
We did save.

5074
05:15:00,600 --> 05:15:02,500
And I did it all on normal.

5075
05:15:04,760 --> 05:15:06,580
I am not...

5076
05:15:07,800 --> 05:15:08,320
Hello?

5077
05:15:08,600 --> 05:15:10,760
Wait, we could have changed this the entire time.

5078
05:15:12,320 --> 05:15:14,600
Look, he looks like such a nice boy.

5079
05:15:16,140 --> 05:15:16,960
This though?

5080
05:15:17,040 --> 05:15:17,960
Excuse me.

5081
05:15:18,900 --> 05:15:19,260
Hello?

5082
05:15:19,260 --> 05:15:21,500
Oh, I unlocked this.

5083
05:15:29,900 --> 05:15:31,360
Look at him here.

5084
05:15:32,100 --> 05:15:35,140
You could take that guy to your parents.

5085
05:15:35,860 --> 05:15:36,480
Not this guy.

5086
05:15:38,540 --> 05:15:40,380
After you take him to your parents.

5087
05:15:41,280 --> 05:15:43,520
After you take him to your parents.

5088
05:15:45,780 --> 05:15:47,360
Give Virgil a test drive.

5089
05:15:48,040 --> 05:15:49,160
Is everything unlocked from the beginning?

5090
05:15:50,040 --> 05:15:52,000
I think I am hungry.

5091
05:15:52,000 --> 05:15:53,740
So, I think...

5092
05:15:53,740 --> 05:15:55,860
I think maybe sometime...

5093
05:15:55,860 --> 05:15:57,460
Maybe if I am just like... I don't know what to do.

5094
05:15:57,800 --> 05:16:02,000
Maybe we can do like... I play Virgil as long as I can go...

5095
05:16:02,980 --> 05:16:04,160
In one sitting.

5096
05:16:04,640 --> 05:16:05,300
Kind of deal.

5097
05:16:05,420 --> 05:16:09,440
We will see how far can I get through the game as Virgil.

5098
05:16:10,280 --> 05:16:12,180
Or like, maybe also give myself a time limit.

5099
05:16:12,280 --> 05:16:17,340
How far can I get through the game in like 10 hours or something as Virgil.

5100
05:16:17,960 --> 05:16:18,900
Kind of dealio.

5101
05:16:18,900 --> 05:16:22,840
Very good idea.

5102
05:16:23,140 --> 05:16:25,780
But I am hungry.

5103
05:16:26,440 --> 05:16:28,980
So, I am going to go eat dinner.

5104
05:16:29,500 --> 05:16:32,040
And thank you guys for hanging out with me.

5105
05:16:32,540 --> 05:16:34,600
We beat two games this week.

5106
05:16:35,140 --> 05:16:35,900
Actually three.

5107
05:16:36,220 --> 05:16:38,600
Because I guess you can count me side.

5108
05:16:38,780 --> 05:16:41,620
So we beat Indiana Jones, me side and this game.

5109
05:16:42,480 --> 05:16:44,400
Tomorrow we start Metal Gear Solid 4.

5110
05:16:45,880 --> 05:16:46,880
And yeah.

5111
05:16:48,340 --> 05:16:49,340
Otsuminto everybody.

5112
05:16:52,260 --> 05:16:56,500
The chat already told you when the game first released they bumped up the difficulty by one level.

5113
05:16:56,580 --> 05:16:58,160
So normal was actually hard.

5114
05:16:59,220 --> 05:17:00,400
I am a gamer.

5115
05:17:04,060 --> 05:17:08,580
You won't catch me playing games on hard very often.

5116
05:17:10,780 --> 05:17:12,460
But no, I don't think anybody told me that.

5117
05:17:12,460 --> 05:17:14,340
But they did say that this game was pretty difficult.

5118
05:17:16,100 --> 05:17:18,300
Oh they fixed that for special edition?

5119
05:17:20,400 --> 05:17:22,580
Let me have the win.

5120
05:17:24,840 --> 05:17:25,700
Otsuminto everybody.

5121
05:17:25,880 --> 05:17:26,840
Thank you.

5122
05:17:32,130 --> 05:17:32,390
Bye.

5123
05:18:42,500 --> 05:18:43,820
Maybe I am in series.

5124
05:18:44,740 --> 05:18:46,000
Once we are done with Devil May Cry.

5125
05:18:51,550 --> 05:18:52,970
I am too emo.

5126
05:18:55,880 --> 05:18:56,880
I don't smile.

5127
05:19:00,320 --> 05:19:01,200
Shadow Generations.

5128
05:19:01,280 --> 05:19:01,820
Oh my god.

5129
05:19:02,760 --> 05:19:03,420
I kind of want to

5130
05:19:08,050 --> 05:19:08,230
play.

5131
05:19:08,590 --> 05:19:11,290
I was talking to Doki the other night and she was talking about the...

5132
05:19:11,290 --> 05:19:14,630
She was like, look the Hello Kitty DLC for Minecraft.

5133
05:19:15,630 --> 05:19:17,310
And I was like...

5134
05:19:17,310 --> 05:19:18,730
I was like, oh yeah.

5135
05:19:19,030 --> 05:19:22,910
She didn't realize that those kinds of modes have all new gameplay.

5136
05:19:23,170 --> 05:19:25,410
I played the Sonic Minecraft a little bit before.

5137
05:19:29,230 --> 05:19:29,670
So...

5138
05:19:29,670 --> 05:19:30,330
I am

5139
05:19:40,720 --> 05:19:41,960
going to go.

5140
05:19:42,700 --> 05:19:44,460
Yeah, before the song loops.
