00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Hello!

2
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,000
Hi!

3
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,930
Hello!

4
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,470
There's a lot of Pano Mimi mousepad!

5
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,090
It is!

6
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,910
Ta-da!

7
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,590
It's so cute, right?

8
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,850
It's a buba!

9
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,170
Shake in my desk.

10
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,210
Bubba.

11
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,810
a mouse pad.

12
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,050
But it's like one of the flatter ones, right?

13
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,890
It's just like, no.

14
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,350
There's no support here.

15
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,930
Um, hope you're doing well, Minky.

16
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,390
Hope you have good gotcha luck.

17
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,590
Thank you.

18
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,590
Thank you.

19
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:04,830
Thank you.

20
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:05,390
Thank you.

21
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,390
Thank you.

22
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,510
Thank you.

23
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,330
Recoup some of those shipping fees, right?

24
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:42,210

25
00:04:49,890 --> 00:05:14,050
um so we have 10 so these boxes I have three boxes and then I have two also sorry my gloves I washed them but they're so gross still what did I do last time I don't remember anyway uh I have three boxes 1, 2, 3, and they are...

26
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,390
All...

27
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,870
All characters, I will get them.

28
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,010
Everybody here.

29
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,110
Here.

30
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,410
I should at least.

31
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,630
That's like, that's what they said.

32
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,250
But...

33
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,650
But!

34
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,190
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, so we have one.

35
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,470
We have two.

36
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,850
We have three.

37
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,470
Which is a little smaller for some reason.

38
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,030
Wow.

39
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,250
It's like Girl Scout cookies.

40
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,050
But there are...

41
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,290
There are...

42
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,410
Two games that I could not get the box for.

43
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,410
So each box comes with ten.

44
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,210
I bought ten of each.

45
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,390
in an attempt to get everybody from Peace Walker M4.

46
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,970
So these are the gotchas for real.

47
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,050
These are the gotchas.

48
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,310
These are the real gotcha.

49
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,050
Is that a cinema roll desk mat?

50
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,070
It is.

51
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,210
My Koharu one is stuck in...

52
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,250
Hmm.

53
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:46,190
So, I will obviously take these out, but We won't do these ones last because they're the actual gotcha, but as you can see, there's many characters.

54
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,810
We do not want him.

55
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,110
And then...

56
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,610
Oh, sorry, the light is so strong.

57
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,450
Uh...

58
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,290
We do not want her.

59
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,770
No Huey.

60
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,810
No Naomi.

61
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,810
Yeah.

62
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,570
Yeah.

63
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,030
No Huey.

64
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,810
No Naomi.

65
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,230
The irony of unboxing characters from Metal Gear, which is well known for their boxes.

66
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,790
Oh, it's so true, right?

67
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,650
No, Huey.

68
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,070
No, Neobi.

69
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,430
Say it with me.

70
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,150
Say it with me.

71
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,030
No, Huey.

72
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,550
Wait, I think I wrote it.

73
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:25,990
No.

74
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,270
Well.

75
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,530
No, Neobi.

76
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,610
No, Huey.

77
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,510
No, Neobi.

78
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,450
No, Huey.

79
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,330
No, Neobi.

80
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,290
No, Huey.

81
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,570
Good luck, boss.

82
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,150
Salute.

83
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,970
I'm saluting you.

84
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,510
I'm saluting you, you can't see, but you know.

85
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,530
Oops, all Hueys.

86
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:57,730

88
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,120

89
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,760
one moment please One moment, please.

90
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,960
I gotta find the box.

91
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,720
Where did it go?

92
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,680
Oh.

93
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:52,940
Ah!

94
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Ah!

95
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,400
Ouch.

96
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,100
Okay, we're fine.

97
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:58,880
Everything's good.

98
00:08:59,640 --> 00:08:59,980
We're calm.

99
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,400
We're chill.

100
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,320
We're cool, connected.

101
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,920
Everything's good.

102
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,240
And when I ordered, it came with this sick sticker.

103
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,920
Cute.

104
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,660
So cute.

105
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
My mouse is delicate.

106
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,560
What do you mean?

107
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,760
What do you mean by that?

108
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,380
My mouse is delicate.

109
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,040
Small?

110
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,680
Sorry,

111
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
there's cat hair.

112
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
Okay, let me open this.

113
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,700
Uh, oh, I was gonna take off my gloves.

114
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,740
No, Naomi, no Huey is the new Kua Bara Kua Bara.

115
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,770
Kua Bara, or warding off, instead of lightning, we're warding off Naomi and Huey.

116
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,460
How's it that?

117
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,540
It's a small mouse?

118
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,440
that small?

119
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,400
Uh.

120
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,080
Placing my best on getting at least two Hueys.

121
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,620
Don't do that to me!

122
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,210
One moment, please.

123
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,390
I like my mouse.

124
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,550
I don't think it's that small.

125
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,110
I mean, it's maybe a little smaller, but it's like so... It's like the best mouse I've ever owned.

126
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,650
My old one broke and I got a new one.

127
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,330
I love this mouse.

128
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,970
Gamba and the gamba.

129
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,270
You mean the gacha?

130
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,270
Whoa!

131
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,350
Whoa, they're red.

132
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,730
Whoa, who will we get first?

133
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,910
How do I open this?

134
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,550
Oh, there's a little flap.

135
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,310
Who are these characters?

136
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,310
Are they from one of your Japanese anime's?

137
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,690
I think we're gonna get...

138
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,370
Otakon!

139
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,010
Because you sent that!

140
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,390
Oh gosh, the stickers.

141
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,450
You guys look first.

142
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,130
Who is it?

143
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,490
Who is it?

144
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,550
I was right!

145
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,170
No way!

146
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,150
I suddenly want to get Otakon first!

147
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,150
No!

148
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:44,950
No!

149
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:44,950
No!

150
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,650
Freaking wait!

151
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,970
That's crazy, look.

152
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,210
Uh-oh.

153
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Uh-oh.

154
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,900
I think I just used it all.

155
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,680
Uh-oh.

156
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,980
Uh-oh.

157
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,200
I think I just used it all.

158
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,620
And now we won't...

159
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,800
Now we'll only get...

160
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,400
Okay, I'm gonna put the, like, the standy over here, but I'll leave the character right there.

161
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:27,020
there next 10 naobies I will if I'm already dead but I will kill myself again somehow Psycho Mintus is real yes

162
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:40,380
surprise stream what are the odds opening a solid Minto probably like in a million

163
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,460
Hello?

164
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,460
Thank you for the supertats.

165
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,240
Believe, boss.

166
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Believe.

167
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,780
Gray Fox?

168
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,880
You think it's Gray Fox?

169
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,580
Gray Fox?

170
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,780
In three, two, one!

171
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,200
That was a genome soldier.

172
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,760
He's so cute, though.

173
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,520
Look at his head.

174
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
His head is... Oh, you can't tell.

175
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,020
I'm sorry, I'm too lazy to focus it.

176
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,400
Ah, Genome Soldier.

177
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,480
180 IQ, Dufus.

178
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,880
Next.

179
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,100
Oh, what did I...

180
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,340
Oh, okay.

181
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,620
Next, next, next, next.

182
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,860
Oh, I forgot to read out what characters we can get.

183
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,760
Let me do that real quick.

184
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:45,300
So we can get Ocelot, Psycho Mantis, Liquid, Vulcan Raven, Genome Soldier, Snake, Atacon, Grey Fox, and Emeril.

185
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,940
I forgot to say, sorry.

186
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,520
Next up is Ocelot.

187
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,200
All right.

188
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,520
Ocelot is in here.

189
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,740
What if it's not Ocelot?

190
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,380
I kind of wish they had a thing for Mei Ling.

191
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,620
Because she had a 3D model in...

192
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,560
What's it called?

193
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,860
VR missions, but they pretty much stuck to anybody.

194
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,500
Only the people that have the models in.

195
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,340
Oh my gosh.

196
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,240
Look at this.

197
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,040
These are so tough to rip.

198
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Only people with models in the games.

199
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,900
Thank God no Naomi or Huey.

200
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,440
Well, Huey's not in this game.

201
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,360
But luckily, we don't have a chance to get another Naomi.

202
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,440
Honestly, if I get Naomi, I'll...

203
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,220
Maybe they torture it a little bit.

204
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,900
What did we say, Vulcan Raven?

205
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,540
I see Pete.

206
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,500
Oh, oh.

207
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,840
What do you see?

208
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,740
Wait, is that Gray Fox?

209
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
Gray Fox!

210
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,840
Oh, it looks so good!

211
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,040
He looks so cool.

212
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,640
They look so good, the models.

213
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,920
Or, I mean, obviously, it's just from the game, but...

214
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,220
Gray Fox, baby.

215
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,620
Gray Fox.

216
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,400
Next, next, next.

217
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
I apologize for being wrong about Ocelot.

218
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,560
Yeah, I molested Gray Fox, I'm so sorry.

219
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,120
Sorry to him.

220
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,800
After Zanzibar, I was taken from the battlefield.

221
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,540
Neither truly alive nor truly dead.

222
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,640
Who is it?

223
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,280
I think this is Vulcan Raven.

224
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,160
I think this is Vulcan Raven.

225
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,040
Nope, I think it's liquid.

226
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,940
I could tell from his legs!

227
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,960
Did I miss a birthday?

228
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,600
Oh, my mouse is not there.

229
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,360
Sorry.

230
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
That's embarrassing.

231
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,020
I turned another year older today.

232
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,740
Can I get a happy birthday?

233
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,240
Of course!

234
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,860
Eric, happy birthday!

235
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,600
Happy birthday!

236
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,660
Happy birthday!

237
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,400
I really like your keyboard, by the way.

238
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,100
Thank you!

239
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,900
I can't remember what it is right now.

240
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,960
I can't remember the model name right now.

241
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,140
I've said in a member stream, but I cannot remember.

242
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,100
I'm so sorry.

243
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,020
Logitech?

244
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,500
No, no.

245
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,660
Or this?

246
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,700
Logitech.

247
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,420
Keyboard?

248
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,460
Not Logitech.

249
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,420
This is something else I can't remember ever.

250
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,340
I'm so sorry.

251
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,700
It is all glowy.

252
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,420
Yeah.

253
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,920
And it sounds good too, hold on, oh, I did it again.

254
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,920
Hold on, let me, here I'll do a little sound test for you guys.

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,680
Can you hear

256
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,080
this?

257
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,420
Hold on, let me move my mic closer.

258
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,030
Yes.

259
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,070
Yes, yes, yes.

260
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,510
I think I saw someone.

261
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,590
Is Big Boss supposed to have the same jacket as Liquid and 1 and 4?

262
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,750
Or is it just a coincidence?

263
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,240
Does he?

264
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm looking at it.

265
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,960
Is it the same?

266
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,520
I don't know.

267
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,300
I think it's the...

268
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,280
K99 something.

269
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,380
That sounds right.

270
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,240
That sounds right.

271
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,140
That does sound right.

272
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
That does sound right.

273
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,160
Okay, so we have Otakon, Genome Soldier, Grey Fox, Liquid.

275
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,220
How many do we have left?

276
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,780
One, two, three, four, five, six.

277
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,660
Oh, yeah, because I opened four.

278
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,160
Math.

279
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,280
Math.

280
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
Oh, my gosh, why can't I?

282
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,920
Do you think snake that he wears?

283
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:43,300
Oh, snake that he wears in four, that trench coat, I think is just like a beige trench coat.

284
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,740
I think.

285
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,240
I don't think it's like a...

286
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,080
I don't remember what big boss wears at the end.

287
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,740
I'm scared, you guys.

288
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,160
What if I get two Naomi's?

289
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,740
What do I do?

290
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,700
I trust we'll get every single character.

291
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,520
I trust.

292
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,440
Here we go!

293
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,860
It is!

294
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,440
Can you tell?

295
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,460
By their feet?

296
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,460
Uh...

297
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,140
By the feet.

298
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,180
Wait, sniper wolf?

299
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,020
Yeah!

300
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,600
It's sniper wolf!

301
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,720
We got her, we got her.

302
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
Wish dollars to fund future gamba.

303
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,640
No!

304
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,560
It's like that one account, that Twitter account that will identify people by their feet.

305
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,000
Me, I know.

306
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,920
Actually, I cheated.

307
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
I saw the little tippy tip of her gun.

308
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,400
I cheated.

309
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,400
I cheated.

310
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,840
I'll admit when I'm...

311
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,760
When I'm...

312
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,320
When I'm...

313
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,540
Ugh!

314
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,460
Because I'm playing dirty.

315
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,080
Ugh!

316
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,180
Go!

317
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,180
I am a phony, I know, I know!

318
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,340
Okay, what about this one?

319
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,900
Oh!

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,660
Oh, this is Psycho Mantis.

321
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,320
Yeah!

322
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,230
See, I can tell.

323
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,930
Okay, that one I didn't cheat at all.

324
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,550
That one I could tell.

325
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,610
That one was easy.

326
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,130
Mantis!

327
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,170
You see the new diecast figure of Rex.

328
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,630
Oh, wait.

329
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,510
Yes?

330
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,150
I definitely saw the new Grey Fox.

331
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,570
That's not diecast, though.

332
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,090
Metal Gear.

333
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,090
Rex is the name if you're interested.

334
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,650
I will look it up later because I can't quite.

335
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,090
You like water park simulator, don't you?

336
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,970
Chokokin Rex.

337
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,430
Is it good?

338
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,730
Is it like...

339
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,470
Is it...

340
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,350
Is it like... does it light up?

341
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:44,810
Is it fancy it has led lights it does oh my gosh okay awesome okay can we tell who it is from their feet wait my bad let's see i think it's vulcan raven actually this time yep i was right i'm maybe too good at this i may be too good at this baby We only have just a few left.

342
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,650
I really want to get through these so that we can get to the actual gotcha, you know?

343
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,690
But you know how we...

344
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,590
Oh, we still haven't gotten...

345
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:06,990
We still haven't gotten one particular person who will be...

346
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,510
This one's Naomi.

347
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,930
Can you imagine if if they accidentally put like MGS4 now?

348
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:42,390
They'll what if they're I kind of wish they had like secret characters in this too Nothing wrong with being interested in feet Says you says you Open Open Look I got it all crumpled up Open Okay, I got it.

349
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,250
I'm strong Can we tell from their feet?

350
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,070
Who are we missing?

351
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,150
We're missing Meryl?

352
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:53,840
Snake?

353
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
An Ocelot.

354
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,720
I can't believe we haven't got Snake yet.

355
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,440
Just kidding, we got him.

356
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,050
Speak of the devil!

357
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,330
Okay, this is empty now.

358
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,910
But I have two left.

359
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:22,850
Stealth.

360
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,350
Camo Soldier is the secret one.

361
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,390
That'd be silly.

362
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,670
I think Ocelot is holding out on us.

363
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,250
I think he's gonna be the very last.

364
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,190
Because Desire Meter, right?

365
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,850
Desire Meter.

366
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,330
No.

367
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,930
I got him!

368
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,450
Oh!

369
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,510
Oh!

370
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,270
And that means our girl Merrill is last.

371
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,000

372
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,700

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,740
It just looks gross.

376
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,660
It's okay.

377
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,560
It wasn't like a...

378
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,280
What's the word?

379
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,420
It was just chapstick.

380
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,140
It wasn't even like a lipstick.

381
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,260
Hectoplasm everywhere.

382
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,080
I know!

383
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:01,920
Gross!

384
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,860
Gross, gross, gross.

385
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,160
Gross.

386
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,700
Minky slaver.

387
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,820
Not the authentic Otaku grease smear

388
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm not very good at opening these, you guys She popped out And that's our MGS1 cast Yay Yay everybody's here Everybody's here mistake.

Everybody's here.

391
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,780
Everybody's here.

392
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,340
Yubi!

393
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,360
Okay, so that's our first box.

394
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,300
Our second box to go through.

395
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,720
Metal Gear Solid 2.

396
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,620
Oh wait, this also has tape on it.

397
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,400
Where's Decoy Octopus?

398
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,340
Yeah!

399
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,780
Yeah!

400
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,340
Where is he?

401
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,840
They included everybody from Foxhound except him!

402
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,660
That's so sad!

403
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,340
I also wish that they had like little ones of the actual Metal Gears.

404
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,180
Like having one of...

405
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,040
Rex would be incredible.

406
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,500
The DARPA chief!

407
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
All of them could be decoy octopus.

408
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,140
So true!

409
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,200
Hold on, I'm opening these real quick so that I don't have to keep taking my gloves off.

410
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,560
You pulled 10 decoy octopuses in me.

411
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,820
Oh wait, Yanwei, I just saw your other one.

412
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,000
Better luck next poll.

413
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,500
How did you pull so many decoy octopuses in a row?

414
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,060
Push this aside.

415
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,020
Okay.

416
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,620
Alrighty, I'm just two, two, two, two.

417
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,800
Who do you think we'll start with, everybody?

418
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,620
Are these ones going to be blue?

419
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,940
Oh, they're so pretty!

420
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,900
Oh my gosh, they're such a nice shade of blue.

421
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,120
Whoa!

422
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,460
Wow, okay, so this, for these we can get Raiden, Snake.

423
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,600
Wait, can we get Pliskin?

424
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,440
No!

425
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,720
No Pliskin.

426
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:05,640
Otacon, Emma, Vamp, Fortune, Ocelot, Olga, Solidus, and Fat Man.

427
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,060
No Rose!

428
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
What's the point?

429
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,280
What's the point?

430
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,540
What's the point?

431
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,740
What's the point?

432
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,560
No!

433
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,120
No Pliskin!

434
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,640
No Rose!

435
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,660
First pull is vamp.

436
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,900
Okay, let's see.

437
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,020
I'm nervous.

438
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm nervous.

439
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,640
Luckily with these boxes, we know we're getting every character, so...

440
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,320
Sorry it's not the more fun gotcha, but we gotta save up for the fun gotcha, you know?

441
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,160
We gotta get through the unfun gotcha.

442
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,180
It's fun to see who we get, though, you know.

443
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,020
First pull Otakon again?

444
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,960
That would be crazy.

445
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,240
Is it Otakon?

446
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,860
Oh, close!

447
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,420
It's a sister!

448
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,080
Wow, she's so...

449
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
Like, her acrylic is so skinny.

450
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,460
We got E-E!

451
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,560
And the stand is also blue.

452
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,340
It's so pretty.

453
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,680
Eee.

454
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,720
Close enough.

455
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,240
Yay.

456
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,940
I'll put the sticker right there.

457
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,420
Eee.

458
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
Does it have a bird?

459
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,740
It does not.

460
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,740
I thought it might be like on her shoulder or something.

461
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,460
How?

462
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,860
I miss you.

463
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,340
How?

464
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,580
Jennifer, how?

465
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,380
Jennifer, how is here.

466
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,280
Oh, oops.

467
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,420
No bird.

468
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,770
I ate it.

469
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,940
Solo bird acrylic.

470
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,700
Right!

471
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,000
That would have been awesome, too.

472
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,920
Oh, this one seems kind of fat.

473
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,000
Fat man?

474
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,660
Oh, no, it's solidus.

475
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,440
I'm so sorry, my president.

476
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,620
Why is he giving such like Sephiroth vibes?

477
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,620
You know?

478
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,320
That's my president.

479
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,940
That's my president.

480
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,260
That's my president.

481
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,160
Solidus.

482
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,260
No, that is not Solid Snake.

483
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,920
But this is Solid Snake.

484
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,160
I'm calling it here.

485
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,220
Alert the presses.

486
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,960
Solid Snake is in this package.

487
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,120
Solid Snake!

488
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:49,960
Solid...

489
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,320
Solid Snake, I'm gonna get you...

490
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,380
I'm gonna get you out of there!

491
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,420
I'm gonna get you out of there!

492
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,320
I'm gonna get you...

493
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,020
I'm gonna get you out of there!

494
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,140
I'm gonna get you...

495
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,320
Okay, I got it.

496
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,140
I'm really...

497
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,880
Snake, I'm getting you out of here!

498
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,220
Wait, there's no soldiers for this one.

499
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,880
No Grilukovic soldiers, huh?

500
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,240
It's kind of sad.

501
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,260
I guess there's so many characters and two?

502
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,000
That'd be hard to like do every single one.

503
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:19,940
Snake!

504
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:20,740
Olga!

505
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,280
We got Olga!

506
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,480
No, that is not solid steak.

507
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,590
Sorry.

508
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,470
Her standy is also so skinny.

509
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,710
You might be asking, Minto, where are you gonna put all these?

510
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:51,890
Hey.

511
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,490
I'm gonna take my glasses off now.

512
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,210
Yeah!

513
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,610
Snake looks a little different.

514
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,390
He's pregnant now.

515
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,650
He's pregnant now.

516
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,920
And pregnant.

517
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,300
Yeah, because Olga's pregnant.

518
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,180
Who is this one?

519
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,040
Who is it?

520
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,120
Let's see if we can tell by their feet.

521
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,280
Oh!

522
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,600
I saw a sign!

523
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,490
I love when I can just grip them, you know, when I can...

524
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:03,890
Yeah!

525
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,670
Like this.

526
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,390
Yeah!

527
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,970
Snake- I don't like that word.

528
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,170
That sounds weird.

529
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,110
Snake listens to Minto karaoke confirmed.

530
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:17,850
Emprig.

531
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,530
No!

532
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,050
What are you talking about?

533
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,390
Who do we have left?

534
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,550
We've pulled four.

535
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,630
So we have six left.

536
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:28,890
We have Ryden.

537
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,050
Snake.

538
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:30,890
Otacon.

539
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,470
Fortune vamp.

540
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,910
Fat man.

541
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,150
I think this one's fat man.

542
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,660
Fat man In here Fat man in your area

543
00:33:51,160 --> 00:34:07,460
It's fat man It's fat man And if it's not fat man It's a fat man My fat may be his dumpy It's snake It's snake It's snake It's snake It's snake It's snake

544
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,030
I knew it was a fat bag.

545
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,980
I knew.

546
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,320
Am I good or what?

547
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,580
These stinking stickers, man.

548
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,820
They're fine up until the very end.

549
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,720
What's up with that?

550
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,440
Jack, welcome back.

551
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,520
Snake cake.

552
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,060
Oops.

553
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,880
You guys want to guess who it was?

554
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,980
Oops.

555
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,280
Equivalent of the vulgan grip.

556
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,720
Yes, that is so sick.

557
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,400
Fortune Fat Man.

558
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,400
I'll have

559
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
to find it amongst the debris.

560
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,120
Yeah, here he's in my hands.

561
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,100
He's in my hands.

562
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,580
Or she?

563
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
jump scare.

564
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,100
We got vamp.

565
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,800
Where'd my box go?

566
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,200
Here we go.

567
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,060
All right, that's four left.

568
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,700
Four, four left.

569
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,720
The bisexual!

570
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,980
Okay.

571
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,080
Okay.

572
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,190
I'm not even trying to be...

573
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,910
I'm not even trying to be gentle anymore.

574
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,610
Okay, there we go.

575
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,990
Who could it be?

576
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,470
Feet?

577
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:07,930
Fat Man?

578
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,430
Oh, to God.

579
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,790
God, we haven't got him yet.

580
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,770
It's like the opposite.

581
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,030
Skinny man.

582
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,470
Biny baby ghost freaks it and struggles.

583
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,210
No, I'm not.

584
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,650
What do you mean, baby?

585
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,310
What do you mean, baby?

586
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,410
Wow.

587
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,110
You need scissors.

588
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,030
61.

589
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,230
So now we need fortune.

590
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:37,970
Batman.

591
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,330
Riden.

592
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,210
Why do we keep not getting the main person?

593
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:56,450
until the very end you know tiny baby tiny baby you say huh tiny baby

594
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:24,180
we're dramatics do you think it's gonna happen like that with the other ones too I'm nervous who have we obtained so far for two we've gotten Otacon, Emma, Olga, Ocelot, Vamp, Solidus.

595
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,140
And now we have...

596
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,200
Standy!

597
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,560
I just...

598
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
All of these are gonna...

599
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,020
All of these are the same stand...

600
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,240
Yeah, they are all the same bases.

601
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,100
I just realized.

602
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,800
I've been putting them all in like a pile, like this.

603
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,720
And I was like, wait, what if the bases are different sizes?

604
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,140
But they all seem to be...

605
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,600
The same.

606
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,040
Yeah.

607
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,670
Okay.

608
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,510
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,170
I was like about to say...

610
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,730
Wait, I might have screwed myself.

611
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,750
I think...

612
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,510
This is fortune.

613
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,950
Wait, can we tell by the feet?

614
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,550
Yeah, it's fortune.

615
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:15,610
Yay!

616
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,030
Fortune, fortune!

617
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,750
Gosh, she's so sick.

618
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,850
Let's see...

619
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:23,730
Nice!

620
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,830
Ryden's holding out on us.

621
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,170
The big gun.

622
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,730
My matron!

623
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,410
Thank you!

624
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,830
Thank you so much for the pig!

625
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,790
We get your favorite iconic line from each character you've pulled!

626
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,270
I don't know.

627
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,090
Oh gosh.

628
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,150
Every single one?

629
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,870
Maybe from...

630
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,530
Maybe from here.

631
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,770
I think I got fake gacha packs.

632
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,630
My packs only had Stilman and Jerome's.

633
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,290
No Stilman here.

634
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,210
That guy's blown up.

635
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,750
But I wish we had...

636
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,810
I wish I had a Grilukovic soldier in it, though, too, to match the genome soldier.

637
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,530
You can totally tell who this is.

638
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,450
Entirely from the feet.

639
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,790
That is a fat man.

640
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:19,770
Wow.

641
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,330
Fat Man!

642
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,130
La-ha-ha-ha.

643
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,910
Laugh and grow fat.

644
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,950
Ha-ha-ha.

645
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,330
Hey!

646
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,590
And that last, but not least, is our boy.

647
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,310
Is our...

648
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,130
Is our boy!

649
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,510
Blue packets are mesmerizing.

650
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,670
I love blue things.

651
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,450
I know.

652
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,730
They look nice, right?

653
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,290
The blue color is so...

654
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,090
It's so pretty.

655
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,470
Last but not least.

656
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,330
Come on in.

657
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,510
Come on in.

658
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,350
Come on.

659
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,300
Come on.

660
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,020
Come on.

661
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,400
So cute.

662
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,820
That's my favorite line from him.

663
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,920
When he goes, So cute.

664
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,840
Yay!

665
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,660
That's all from two!

666
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,340
That's all of the standies from two.

667
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,320
All for this and Saucy Jack.

668
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:46,740
Yay!

669
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,480
Yay!

670
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,020
Yay!

671
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:49,640
Yay!

672
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,240
Yay, yay, yay!

673
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,300
Alrighty.

674
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,580
Next up we have three.

675
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:34,660
I didn't buy, they have Delta ones as well, but in one, in some in some Delta pre-order that I got it came with all the acrylic so I did not buy these ones but I think the ones I got came with Eva and then these packs come with Tatiana which is kind of interesting last but least this is my mouse pad it's an artist Panamimi and this is original character of hers.

676
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

677
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,940
One of the many Delta pre-orders.

678
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,080
Yeah.

679
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,880
Can I humbly request a celebratory hand wiggle?

680
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,320
Like this?

681
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,640
Or like this?

682
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,800
My hand wiggle?

683
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,100
Next.

684
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,550
Three.

685
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,170
MGS3.

686
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:18,910
So with this, we can get Snake, the boss, Eva, Young Ocelot, Vulcan, Sorrow, Fear, and Pain, Fury.

687
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,290
I like how they put all of them on this side.

688
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,990
Everybody else on this side.

689
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,430
Oh my gosh, Vulcan's holding the Davy Crockett.

690
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,750
That's so funny.

691
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,430
No Cobra unit?

692
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,670
You spoke too soon.

693
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,410
You spoke too soon.

694
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:35,830
Where is the parrot?

695
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,630
It's on the end!

696
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,760
It's right there!

697
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,360
There is!

698
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,120
The parrot's here.

699
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,100
Oh, whoa!

700
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,660
These ones are green!

701
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,220
Green, green, green, green.

702
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,180
Green, green, green.

703
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,740
Oh, wait, I accidentally took two.

704
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,920
This one.

705
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:01,800
Green.

706
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,320
I thought they would be like a darker green.

707
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,580
They're like lime green.

708
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,600
Makes me thirsty.

709
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:38,360
I can't wait to get the Fury I love his design so much Least favorite boss Well, I want to say least favorite Most frustrating boss, but I don't know I think my least favorite quote unquote is The pain because I don't like swimming But Fury I just I do like the fight.

710
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,060
It's very scary though.

711
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,200
Makes me scared.

712
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,600
Tommy God!

713
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,180
The pain is annoying.

714
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,160
Yeah, I don't know.

715
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,860
I don't like swimming and it's not like super exciting of a battle.

716
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,780
So I'm glad that it's kind of first.

717
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,560
Who do we get first?

718
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,220
Tell by the feet?

719
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,110
I can't tell.

720
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:03,930
Can you guys?

721
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,350
Start finishing MGS a month ago and finish one through three, but it's the best thing ever that's happened to me.

722
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,390
Solitary red.

723
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,930
Thank you.

724
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:12,350
Welcome.

725
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,550
You think it's snake?

726
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:14,430
Eva?

727
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,630
I think it's Eva.

728
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:18,030
Eva!

729
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,870
Ladies first.

730
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,970
And this is the standee.

731
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,330
Wow, it's really green.

732
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,890
Or it's really bright green.

733
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,950
It's really lime green.

734
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,930
Lime, I miss her.

735
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,310
Oh, I was like, what do I do with the box?

736
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:39,410
Okay.

737
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:57,650
ladies she's i know i was gonna say she's the only lady we have but no we have the boss also there's a severe lack of women in this game i guess maybe if you want to count eva and tatiana as two different people but maybe

739
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,590
Remember the aloe vera.

740
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,030
I bet if I kissed you, you'd taste like a wild beast.

741
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,210
Why did she say that?

742
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,650
Why did she say that?

743
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,590
I'm gonna start trying to open from this side.

744
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,210
Okay.

745
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,830
Can't help but see the craw cat.

746
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,470
He's not wearing it.

747
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,390
Oh no, I just tore open my box a little.

748
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,750
No.

749
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,880
Because she's right.

750
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,140
I guess so.

751
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,220
I guess so.

752
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,060
Some kind of judo.

753
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:35,940
Okay.

754
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,180
Who do you think?

755
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,270
This is the end.

756
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,910
I could tell because it was so fuzzy.

757
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,850
His pants were so fuzzy.

758
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,110
Yeah, it's the end.

759
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,230
With the parrot.

760
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,130
Tastes like a wild beast.

761
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,150
Absolute best line with the crocsuit.

762
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:01,590
100%.

763
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,150
Grandpa.

764
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,230
The end?

765
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:09,770
Stream over?

766
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:10,350
No!

767
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,070
No!

768
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,030
That's our first Cobra unit.

769
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,600
Do you hear me?

770
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,660
Snake.

771
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,860
I like me, says that part.

772
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,880
It's so epic.

773
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,700
It's like, just like a really awesome moment.

774
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,400
You think it's the fear next?

775
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,220
Let's check.

776
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,660
We shall check.

777
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,840
I'm like really tearing these up, aren't I?

778
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,540
I was like, is it the box?

779
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,620
Oh,

780
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:14,170
it's the sorrow Nope, it's the boss What's the sorrow look like?

781
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:22,370
Oh, it's close-ish It's kind of close Why is this Why this pose?

782
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,390
Why?

783
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,830
Like, why she...

784
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:31,210
Why?

785
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,710
Why did they choose this?

786
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,430
It's so strange.

787
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,850
Naruto run.

788
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:52,870
I said the sorrow, but it being the joy, kind of... kind of fits.

789
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,030
I uh...

790
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:02,450
But I like now, since I thought they had a similar pose, they really don't.

791
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:03,590
Like...

792
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,410
They really, they really don't.

793
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,230
Wait, they're right next to each other.

794
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,810
But it's because their legs are lifted, you know?

795
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:14,630
Hmm.

796
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,030
Oh, sorry.

797
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:23,650
I have, like, a focus on the back of my camera, so if you hear me pushing it, that's what I'm pushing.

798
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:33,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,110
Oh!

800
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,770
I'm tearing up the whole thing!

801
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:39,890
Okay.

802
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:41,190
There we go.

803
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:41,850
Easy peasy.

804
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,670
Should get a letter opener.

805
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:45,810
Alright.

806
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,430
I'm also kind of disappointed in Orykov.

807
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,810
It's her bum-rushing snake.

808
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,430
Yeah, I know what it is.

809
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:55,250
But...

810
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:55,430
Oh.

811
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,710
I can't tell.

812
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:04,130
Fear?

813
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:05,570
Oh!

814
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:06,450
It's psych!

815
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:07,230
Yeah!

816
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:14,090
I didn't know his pants were so baggy.

817
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,870
Oh, hi Snake!

818
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,470
I'm so sorry!

819
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,190
It's Snake!

820
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,110
Oh, there he is.

821
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,550
And all his glory.

822
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,060
Okay, I'm excited.

823
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,180
After this one, we get to the real gotcha, you guys.

824
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,960
After this, real gotcha, real gotcha.

825
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,200
These ones we know, since it's the...

826
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,560
Boxes, we know that we're getting everyone, but...

827
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,340
Okay.

828
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,900
What's that stance?

829
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,560
Let's go gambling!

830
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,240
Not solid snake.

831
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,760
I didn't say solid snake.

832
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,020
Yes, that solid snake.

833
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,400
Oh my gosh.

834
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,060
My fingers are starting to get tired.

835
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,060
I wonder...

836
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,000
Do I have any scissors?

837
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,580
Do you guys mind if I run and go grab some?

838
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,860
My thumb is starting to get sore.

839
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:31,910
I'll be right back Okay, I'll be right back Give me one second Give me like one second Give me a second Go get Uh I'll be right back

840
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:16,580

841
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,660
Oh this is easy Yes Ah, it feels so good.

842
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,620
It's so clean.

843
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:21,820
Oh.

844
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,720
Thank you, thank you.

845
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,100
Just be careful not to accidentally cut the contents.

846
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:37,740
Bees.

847
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:38,920
Bees.

848
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,560
Many bees.

849
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,860
Look at all the bees.

850
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,780
Look at all the bees.

851
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,940
Nah, we're good.

852
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,800
They're acrylics.

853
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,600
They'll be fine.

854
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,860
Bees, bees, bees.

855
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,880
We got the pain.

856
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,600
I like how it includes his little bees.

857
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,460
There's so many of them.

858
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,990
They're so cute.

859
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,140
Tommy God.

860
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,640
Oh, oh.

861
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,890
Okay, what do we got here?

862
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,400
Cute scissors, thank you.

863
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,520
Something happened to me last Saturday.

864
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,880
I had a couple miles to go.

865
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,280
I looked over my phone and saw what?

866
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,420
I saw that.

867
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:41,940
Wait, hold on.

868
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,680
Saw a glowing VTuber on my phone and I recommended she was playing MGS1 very irregularly.

869
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,780
Who could it be?

870
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,140
Oh.

871
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:03,020
And suddenly there was an intense light all around me and when I came to I was home and watched your entire first playthrough of the MGS series from three years ago.

872
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,800
Three years ago!

873
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,160
You were pretty good.

874
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,100
Three years?

875
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,120
I've been gone.

876
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,080
Are you confusing me for someone else?

877
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,840
But thanks for thinking I'm pretty good.

878
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,740
Oh, that's a lot!

879
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,420
Oh, my...

880
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,220
Why is he posed like this?

881
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,820
It's for me, isn't it?

882
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,660
It's just for me.

883
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,540
Oh my god the camera doesn't want to focus because he's too handsome.

884
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,060
Oh my god.

885
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,100
Oh my god.

886
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,050
It doesn't want to focus because he's...

887
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,820
I want to do this to him.

888
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,890
I want to do this to him.

889
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,580
Okay.

890
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,640
Can't wait to see your oscillot shrine.

891
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,840
There's like a sad amount of of Ocelot merch.

892
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,160
Oh, this one's big.

893
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,460
This one's big.

894
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,200
Who else is?

895
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,540
Who do we?

896
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,240

00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,390
Which one should we do first?

919
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:19,050
Which one should we do first?

920
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:19,930
Let's do four first.

921
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,230
Let's go in, like, game and release order.

922
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:43,210
So for those who were not here before when I explained this, the first three boxes, I, uh, I was able to get the full boxes.

923
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:51,150
And, uh, and the full box comes with every character guaranteed.

924
00:58:52,130 --> 00:59:23,850
But for Metal Gear Solid 4 and Peace Walker they were sold out at the time they were they're back in stock now but they were sold out at the time and so I was just like well I will just get 10 of them like I'm pretending to get a box so here we have 10 for Metal Gear Solid 4 who we can get we can get Old Snake We can get Otacon,

925
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:36,250
we can get Sunny, we can get Ryzen, we can get Isolat, we can get Naomi, we can get Vamp, we can get Eva, Big Mama, we can get Drebin.

926
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:40,290
I've got, why Drebin and not like Johnny?

927
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,750
We can get Drebin and we can get Meryl.

928
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:51,390
Incoming multiple Naomi's, no, no, no.

929
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,610
Please read the pinned tweet.

930
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:54,910
I mean, not pinned tweet.

931
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,490
A pinned comment.

932
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,390
No Naomi, no Huey.

933
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,410
No Naomi, no Huey.

934
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,730
So this is our first one.

935
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:05,730
Hot dog.

936
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,970
Hot dog indeed.

937
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,770
You hate ship Naomi and Huey.

938
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:12,090
Oh.

939
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:15,450
Oh, that's like a crack ship if I've ever heard of one.

940
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,810
Okay.

941
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:21,230
No Naomi, no Huey.

942
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:22,330
No Naomi, no Huey.

943
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,310
No Naomi, no Huey.

944
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:29,270
This is the actual gotcha, you guys.

945
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,890
This is where we can get dupes.

946
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,790
We're praying for one of everybody except Naomi.

947
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:45,010
Oh, my God.

948
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,910
Oh, I was so scared for a second.

949
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,130
I was...

950
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,630
I was...

951
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:53,770
I saw...

952
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,490
I saw a lady.

953
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,770
And I was like, no, no.

954
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:57,790
No, no, no.

955
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,850
It's Big Mafa.

956
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:04,370
It's Big Mafa.

957
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,350
Oh, gosh.

958
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,130
I was scared for this.

959
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,540
And then the base is black.

960
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,200
I like it.

961
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,440
It looks really nice, actually.

962
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,200
Okay.

963
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:25,800
Oh.

964
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,160
Holy.

965
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:28,720
Okay.

966
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,980
Alright, Big Mama off the list, baby.

967
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,800
Let's go.

968
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,200
Okay, I don't want to look at, like, what their poses are.

969
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,520
Because I don't want to...

970
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,300
I want to, like, guess, you know?

971
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,620
I don't want to see him too much.

972
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,340
And...

973
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:45,840
And no.

974
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,060
Merrill?

975
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:05,700
Okay,

976
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:11,990
we are already at a dupe.

977
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:14,110
That's fine!

978
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:15,390
We just...

979
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:49,120
need to get everybody else except except except Naomi we just need to get I can't believe the first two are dupes I cannot believe this I cannot believe this if anyone needs a big mama please trade with me I I could tell the media I saw it We got Drebben,

980
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,860
10 times Big Mama.

981
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,040
How come you get two mobs?

982
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,280
Solid Mama and Liquid Mama.

983
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:01,680
Okay.

984
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,500
Just realized this is kind of reflective.

985
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,240
Ooh, scary.

986
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:05,740
Okay.

987
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,540
Gotta be careful with these ones.

988
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,260
But Naomi is very attractive.

989
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,840
No!

990
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,060
No, she's not.

991
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,020
This is not Naomi.

992
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,840
Oh, it's Menfeet.

993
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,560
Men feet.

994
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,040
Otacon!

995
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,000
Oh!

996
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,170
Okay, we got Otacon, we got Otacon.

997
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,670
Okay, I really just want Snake.

998
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:40,370
I really, okay, I want Sunny Snake and Ocelot, obviously.

999
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,550
And I wanted Otacon.

1000
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:48,990
So we are one out of four of the people that I really wanted.

1001
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:52,570
So far only one dupe.

1002
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,590
Not bad.

1003
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,490
Out of four?

1004
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,110
Could be worse.

1005
01:03:59,050 --> 01:03:59,910
Could be worse.

1006
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:02,390
Okay.

1007
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,060
Oh.

1008
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:15,000
I can call Minto Q and she won't see it because her notif Q is clogged.

1009
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,520
Requesting healing beam.

1010
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,840
Also awful flu today.

1011
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,080
Nicholas, no!

1012
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,460
Beam!

1013
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,500
I think this is snake.

1014
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,960
Oh, we're so sorry, Meryl.

1015
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,760
It's Meryl!

1016
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,300
It's Meryl, it's Meryl!

1017
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,540
One, one, Naomi's special deluxe.

1018
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:51,940
Now!

1019
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:53,380
Okay.

1020
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:54,900
Not a dupe.

1021
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:55,800
Oh, oh, gosh.

1022
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,100
I think Snake's feet are together, together actually now I think about it.

1023
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:04,000
I feel like I recognize his pose the most.

1024
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,660
Alright.

1025
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,480
Alright.

1026
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,320
Alright.

1027
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,740
Oh.

1028
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,280
Wait.

1029
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:23,840
Oh.

1030
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,000
Riden?

1031
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:25,980
No.

1032
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:26,580
Riden?

1033
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:27,800
Riden?

1034
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,800
Oh, oh, I was like, Ryden has heels, though.

1035
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,780
Oh, it's VAMP.

1036
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,480
VAMP.

1037
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,220
I was like, because I saw, like, little grippers.

1038
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:42,720
Oh, gosh.

1039
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:45,580
You see it?

1040
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,060
You see the spiky grippers?

1041
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,440
But Ryden has heels, so I was like, it can't be him.

1042
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,540
I forgot about VAMP, to be honest.

1043
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,100
This is good.

1044
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,780
This is good pulse.

1045
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,340
so far.

1046
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,240
This is pretty good so far.

1047
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,740
This is pretty good so far.

1048
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1049
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,640
All right, all right, all right.

1050
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:15,830
Okay.

1051
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:16,570
All right.

1052
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,850
Sunny snake, come home!

1053
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:21,750
Ocelot, come home!

1054
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,870
Oh, I did the same thing again.

1055
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,610
Oh wait, I think this is sunny.

1056
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:33,550
It's really short.

1057
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,130
Yeah!

1058
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:42,130
Oh my gosh, she's so small.

1059
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,250
Look at her!

1060
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:45,230
What?

1061
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:46,830
Oh my gosh, wait.

1062
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:49,170
If I line them up, look at how some mouse...

1063
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,870
Stop, it's precious.

1064
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,250
It's so cute.

1065
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,130
Oh my gosh, it's too cute.

1066
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,470
It's so precious.

1067
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:10,910
Okay, we have three left.

1068
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,750
We have three left.

1069
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:19,330
We're missing Snake, Ryden, and Ocelot.

1070
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,910
Snake, Ryden, and Ocelot.

1071
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:32,430
And who else?

1072
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:32,930
That's it.

1073
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,290
Ocelot?

1074
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,960
I'm predicting Ocelot.

1075
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,500
lie now.

1076
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,460
Thank me later.

1077
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,060
Wow.

1078
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,740
I'm not thinking yet.

1079
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,140
We got dupe Meryl.

1080
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,840
So we got dupe dupe Big Mama, dupe Meryl.

1081
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,200
We did really well though.

1082
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:17,880
I'm not gonna lie.

1083
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,980
We did crazy good.

1084
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,860
We've done crazy good.

1085
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,300
Is this Otacon?

1086
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,820
Snake or awesome.

1087
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:42,880
alive.

1088
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,160
Am I not gonna get snake or us alive, please?

1089
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,020
Please.

1090
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:57,180
I think it's gonna be snake because he's been holding out on us every single time.

1091
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,300
Except three.

1092
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,720
But he's been holding out on us a bunch.

1093
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,340
So I think it's gonna be snake.

1094
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,300
I think it's gonna be snake.

1095
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:06,380
Trust.

1096
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,780
Trust old snake.

1097
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:08,860
Old snake.

1098
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,300
Old snake.

1103
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:47,710
I don't even remember the monkey's name.

1104
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:58,550
What?

1105
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,390
Mint?

1106
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,190
No, it's not.

1107
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,590
It's not Mickey.

1108
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:05,510
Well, well, well, team.

1109
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,190
Little Gray, my Oshi.

1110
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:09,330
Little Gray.

1111
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,110
Oh my gosh, poor girl!

1112
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:12,970
Spending my birthday alone this year.

1113
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:14,090
I'm super happy my Kamioshi.

1114
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:15,870
That's the design of the street today.

1115
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:21,670
Thank you for staying with us through the chaos of the last I will give you my gotcha look, but I don't have any more guru!

1116
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:23,090
Happy birthday!

1117
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:25,270
Thank you so much.

1118
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,090
Thank you for the hot chocolate soup, but thank you.

1119
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,770
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1120
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,350
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1121
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,250
Happy birthday!

1122
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:39,020
Thank you, thank you.

1123
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,580
Monkey's name is Kevin.

1124
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:41,400
No.

1125
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,480
Alright, so, team, if you also got these...

1126
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,380
Um...

1127
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,200
If you got these...

1128
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:03,340
like Sandeeps as well and you would like to trade a Drebin, Otakon, Meryl, and Big Mama.

1129
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,240
I am in search of...

1130
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,260
I kept... I didn't get Naomi though.

1131
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,400
Oh my gosh.

1132
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,220
No Naomi!

1133
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,020
No Naomi!

1134
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:21,840
I am in search of Snake, Otakon, Ryden.

1135
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,560
Those three.

1136
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,940
And Naomi.

1137
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,880
I want a full set.

1138
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,720
Ah, man.

1139
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,120
Ah, man.

1140
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,200
Next convention I go to.

1141
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,460
I'll bring them with me.

1142
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:46,240
Yeah, I'll bring them with me to the next convention I go to.

1143
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:54,320
And if you have, if you bought your own and have snake, old snake, Acelot.

1144
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,120
Yeah, I guess that's Holiday Matsuri.

1145
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:58,500
Holiday Matsuri.

1146
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:08,240
We have Snake, Acelot, Raiden, or Naomi, I will take those four.

1147
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,300
Alright, but we're not done yet with the gotcha.

1148
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:15,640
We're not done yet.

1149
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,620
We have another.

1150
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,600
We have one last set.

1151
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,340
We have one last set.

1152
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,120
Peace Walker.

1153
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,400
And in here we can get Snake?

1154
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,640
Amanda?

1155
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:35,880
Chico?

1156
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:37,580
Paz?

1157
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,780
Paz?

1158
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,320
Cecile?

1159
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,520
Oh my gosh, what's his name?

1160
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:43,840
The bald man.

1161
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,840
What's his name?

1162
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:48,380
I forgot.

1163
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,000
Wait, yeah.

1164
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,860
Hot cold man.

1165
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1166
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,600
I'm such a fake fan!

1167
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,040
Hot cold man!

1168
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,380
Zadournob!

1169
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:05,380
And, uh, Strange Love, so...

1170
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,520
Yes.

1171
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,740
We will try.

1172
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,680
We shall try!

1173
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,820
We shall try!

1174
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,180
No Huey.

1175
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,020
No Huey.

1176
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:14,740
No Huey.

1177
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,280
No Huey.

1178
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,260
No Naomi, no Huey.

1179
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,520
No Naomi, no Huey.

1180
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,820
I wonder... I guess it's gold, the base for this one.

1181
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,620
Oops, I accidentally cut into the...

1182
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,400
Cardboard?

1183
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

1184
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:34,350
Amanda, Amanda, and then, wow, it's really yellow.

1185
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:36,470
Peace Walker.

1186
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:41,210
Amanda, Amanda, Vinceremos!

1187
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,090
Vinceremos.

1188
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:47,910
If anything, I want, if I get any dupes, I would be really happy with dupes of Paz.

1189
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,590
Really happy with dupes of Paz.

1190
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:58,130
I want, I'm fine with, I'm fine with losing hot, cold man and Zadorna.

1191
01:13:58,210 --> 01:13:59,710
And Huey, obviously.

1192
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:06,330
Just letting you know that 10 unique polls from 10 possible results has a 0.04 probability.

1193
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:09,530
I don't care what the probability is.

1194
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,330
I don't care.

1195
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:12,950
I don't care.

1196
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:16,710
Streamer luck.

1197
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:18,050
Streamer luck.

1198
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:19,590
Oops.

1199
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,170
I did it again.

1200
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,550
Oh, Cecile!

1201
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:31,170
The lady who was introduced and never heard from again.

1202
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,350
Kaminandes.

1203
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,890
Kojima Kaminandes.

1204
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,750
Come on, let me pick up my trash.

1205
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:40,570
Kojima is God.

1206
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:43,970
She likes birds.

1207
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:46,070
We're getting all the women!

1208
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:51,410
Which means Paz is coming up, baby.

1209
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,470
Paz is coming up.

1210
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:53,970
Wait.

1211
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,090
Uh-oh.

1212
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:57,650
No.

1213
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:58,750
No.

1214
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:00,410
Who else is thick?

1215
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:01,770
It could be snake.

1216
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:03,370
No.

1217
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:05,330
No, no, no, no, no.

1218
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:10,470
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1219
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:11,990
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1220
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:16,670
And it feels really different from these two.

1221
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:18,050
No, no, no, no.

1222
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,610
I'll put this one last.

1223
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,780
I'm in denial.

1224
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,320
Denial.

1225
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,820
Denial is a river in Africa.

1226
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,460
I gotta turn this over.

1227
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,240
There's...

1228
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,440
Uh...

1229
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:41,900
Cause?

1230
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,020
The doorknob!

1231
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,700
Rocket peace!

1232
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,460
The doorknob.

1233
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,360
Rocket...

1234
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,120
Oh my gosh, I'm making a huge mess.

1235
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,540
Oh, here too.

1236
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,280
Oh my goodness.

1237
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,240
Oh, here.

1238
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,020
I'm making a huge mess.

1239
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,760
Okay, but that's three for three?

1240
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,680
Three for three?

1241
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:36,420
Okay.

1242
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,780
Oh, why are these ones so hard to do?

1243
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,220
The other ones are so easy.

1244
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,480
Can't get it in the hole.

1245
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,420
There we go.

1246
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:56,740
No.

1247
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,840
No, God, no, God, no, no.

1248
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,080
You guys look first.

1249
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,300
Oh, wait, I don't think it's Huey.

1250
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:17,360
Oh!

1251
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:22,390
Oh,

1252
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,540
pause.

1253
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,620
Pacific Ocean, my beloved.

1254
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,140
Oh, I'm so happy already.

1255
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,740
I'm so happy already.

1256
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,740
I'm so happy already.

1257
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,560
I'm so happy already!

1258
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:44,240
Ah!

1259
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,020
Oh, oh, oh!

1260
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,940
Oh, she's so, oh, she's so beautiful.

1261
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,780
Oh, oh, oh!

1262
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:52,860
Oh!

1263
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,200
Hot dog indeed!

1264
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:55,980
Pause!

1265
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:01,680
Yeah!

1266
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:06,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1267
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:07,630
Yeah!

1268
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,930
Oh, I'm so happy already!

1269
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:10,410
Uh oh.

1270
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:16,100
Snake!

1271
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,760
Snake, snake, snake!

1272
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,310
I went!

1273
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:33,350
There's legs!

1274
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,050
Wait, I think this is the doorknob.

1275
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:37,930
Oh, it's Kaz!

1276
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:43,730
Wait, I said Kaz earlier for the doorknob and now we got Kaz!

1277
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:47,470
I've completely... I've got them.

1278
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:48,590
They're very similar.

1279
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,930
Their toes are very similar.

1280
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,550
He's got a bit more of a heel.

1281
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:56,150
Yeah!

1282
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,130
Guys!

1283
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:58,090
Guys!

1284
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,070
This is crazy!

1285
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,590
This is good!

1286
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:03,290
This is good!

1287
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,090
This is good!

1288
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:05,790
Oh my gosh!

1289
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,150
Nice shoes.

1290
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:08,510
Oh!

1291
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,360
You're a suit.

1292
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,060
Okay.

1293
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,140
It's pretty bendy on the sides.

1294
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,280
Stop feeling them.

1295
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,140
You're spoiling.

1296
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:35,800
How am I spoiling when I keep thinking that they're, that they're all, I keep thinking they're all Huey.

1297
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:57,130
Okay.

1298
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:57,930
Oh?

1299
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:01,650
Uh, what's his name?

1300
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:02,970
Hot Coldman?

1301
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:04,770
Hot Coldman!

1302
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:07,150
Hot Coldman!

1303
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:08,390
Hot Coldman!

1304
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:13,370
If you could design an MGS figure like a character in a specific pose, what would it look like?

1305
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:19,390
I would do Paz's idol outfit.

1306
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:25,190
There's one picture that you can get as a poster in V.

1307
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:28,670
And I want, I want that as a figure.

1308
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:29,770
I want that.

1309
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,990
That figure.

1310
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,230
I want that.

1311
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,030
That as a, as a figure.

1312
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,170
I want that poster.

1313
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,910
That poster as a figure.

1314
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:41,570
But the, I want that.

1315
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:43,610
But also, of course.

1316
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,510
I got to get Ocelot doing that.

1317
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:48,590
But I don't think I would be able to look at him, you know?

1318
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:50,990
I would be too nervous.

1319
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:53,570
Uh-oh.

1320
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:54,350
Uh-oh.

1321
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:54,930
Uh-oh.

1322
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:55,890
Guys.

1323
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:56,830
Uh-oh.

1324
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:58,150
Uh-oh.

1325
01:20:58,150 --> 01:20:59,010
Uh-oh.

1326
01:20:59,170 --> 01:20:59,850
Uh-oh.

1327
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,090
Very minimal bend.

1328
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,870
Uh-oh.

1329
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:04,570
When did...

1330
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:08,290
When you started the silly military stealth game, did you ever imagine it would rot your brain?

1331
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:08,590
No.

1332
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,510
I did not imagine at all.

1333
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:11,190
Uh-oh.

1334
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:12,090
Uh-oh.

1335
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:13,610
This isn't cheap.

1336
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:14,150
I'm cheating!

1337
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:17,630
Oh no, wait, wait, wait.

1338
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:22,510
This one actually has more bend than this one.

1339
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:25,630
Oh wait, this is the last one.

1340
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:41,910
Oh, legs!

1341
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:44,670
Zadornov, our first dupe.

1342
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,410
Oh, it had no bend!

1343
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,110
It had no bend, you saw that!

1344
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,030
That's crazy!

1345
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:55,050
Our first dupe is such a lame guy.

1346
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:59,790
You guys, I'm a guest at Holiday Matsuri.

1347
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,910
And you know who also is going to be there?

1348
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:03,690
Steve Blum!

1349
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,490
Yeah, the voice of Zordnov is going to be there.

1350
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:10,610
I'm going to ask him to sign my Peace Walker copy.

1351
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:25,760
Chico?

1352
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,140
Chico!

1353
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,140
He's so tiny.

1354
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,100
He's so small.

1355
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,340
He's so tiny.

1356
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,720
Am I not going to get snakes?

01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:59,260

Your love for MGS is one of the reasons why I enjoy watching you.

I think it's hot, cold, man.

1368
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,010
It's true.

1369
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:45,970
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
