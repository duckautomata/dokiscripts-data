1
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,110
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

2
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,630
Wait...

3
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,330
Wait...

4
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,130
Where I put...

5
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,490
Where I put my face...

6
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,290
I have a cup...

7
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,250
Cover...

8
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,010
Hold on, let me take a picture.

9
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,690
Wait, oh no, it doesn't show up.

10
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,470
It's like all just...

11
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,010
Hold on.

12
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,190
Wait, it looks better on my...

13
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,860
I have a cup on my desk and it's...

14
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,200
It's clear, right?

15
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,880
And it's like where I have...

16
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,420
Like where I can see my camera, like my face.

17
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,480
And so it's like distorting my face.

18
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,760
It looks like... Oh my gosh, do you remember?

19
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,160
Like the filters that used to be on like Mac computers and stuff like that?

20
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,060
It looks like one of those.

21
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
Logan, thanks for the 5 gifted!

22
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,920
It looks like one of those.

23
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,820
I just noticed it.

24
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,780
Just now.

25
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,940
I took a picture, but...

26
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,460
It doesn't... It doesn't show what I see.

27
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,460
Hold on, I'm gonna try another picture.

28
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,880
It doesn't... It doesn't...

29
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,260
It doesn't convey very well.

30
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,400
That's okay though, maybe I'll post it on Twitter later.

31
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,840
You laugh at my face too?

32
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm sure you do.

33
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,100
No, I'm just kidding.

34
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Ohamito.

35
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,880
Ohamito!

36
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,580
Anyway.

37
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,420
Hello everybody.

38
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,140
Welcome back to Devil May Cry.

39
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,620
I can't stop looking at it.

40
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,900
Yeah, part 5.

41
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,580
Oh man.

42
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
This is the part where I say give birth.

43
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,140
Thank you guys for 9 months!

44
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,360
Or kidai, thanks for 2 months!

45
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,540
Thank you guys.

46
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,720
I delivered a baby!

47
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,880
It's a girl!

48
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,260
Wow.

49
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Congratulations.

50
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,320
Congratulations.

51
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,000
Alessio, welcome to Mambo Show.

52
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,080
Thank you.

53
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,120
It's me, Dante from Devil May Cry series.

54
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,620
Wow.

55
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
Hold on, sorry.

56
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,080
All the laughing.

57
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,880
For those who don't know, I've been sick.

58
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,060
For like 3... 2 weeks.

59
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,260
2 weeks now.

60
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,440
I hope you fully recovered from illness.

61
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,520
Thank you!

62
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,460
I think I'm like 90% there.

63
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,540
I think maybe.

64
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,180
I think maybe just like a little bit.

65
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,320
Like maybe 2 more days or so.

66
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,640
Actually, I forgot to take my medicine today.

67
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,160
Oopsie!

68
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,780
But it's almost been 3 weeks since I've been sick.

69
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,600
But now I'm getting there.

70
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,180
I'm getting better.

71
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,580
I just have a little bit of a cough.

72
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,460
And...

73
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,660
Take your meds.

74
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,340
I will!

75
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
I will, but my...

76
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,120
Thank you!

77
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,820
Hi Minto.

78
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,880
Hi Minto's new PC.

79
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,960
Hi Tummy Horde, please.

80
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,380
Yeah, I was just about to say.

81
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,360
The medicine has made it so that...

82
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,700
When I eat, like...

83
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,360
You know, when someone gives me an offering...

84
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
And I eat it...

85
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,080
My tummy hordes so bad!

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,500
And it still hurts.

87
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,340
I took an extra couple of minutes to maybe hope that it goes down.

88
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,340
And it didn't!

89
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,480
It's just like a consistent...

90
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,020
It's not like a sharp pain.

91
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
It's just like a consistent pain.

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,140
And just...

93
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,580
Horde!

94
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,200
So bad!

95
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,820
It kind of makes me a little bit winded.

96
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,880
So...

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,820
So if I sound like out of breath...

98
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,160
I apologize.

99
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,020
No, it's not like a cramp.

100
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,200
It's like...

101
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,680
I don't know.

102
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,840
Just anytime I eat.

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,840
So I eat breakfast.

104
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,280
And then Tummy Horde.

105
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,160
And then I eat lunch.

106
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,000
And then Tummy Horde.

107
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,500
And then I eat dinner.

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,460
And it's Tummy Horde.

109
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,980
It's just never ending Tummy Horde hours!

110
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,460
It sucks!

111
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,460
But I think it's because of the medicine.

112
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,000
So...

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,620
I think maybe once I'm off of it for a bit, it'll help.

114
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,120
Hopefully!

115
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,760
Heartburn?

116
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,260
No.

117
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,840
It's in my tummy.

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,760
I don't think I have a heart.

119
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,240
Oh my gosh.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
I was just catching up on your last DMC stream.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,040
I'm going to assume you beat Beowulf in a timely manner.

122
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
Yeah, I did.

123
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,600
Sick at video games.

124
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,880
I'm sick at everything.

125
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,220
Thank you for 9 months!

126
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:47,960
Wait.

127
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,060
Thank you for 9 months.

128
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,460
You gotta take your blue orbs, Mint.

129
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,640
We gotta get some blue orbs for real.

130
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,740
Can I get a blue orb in the chat?

131
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,300
Can I get a blue orb in the chat?

132
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,780
Oh, Lambrus with the blue orbs!

133
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,880
Thank you.

134
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,300
Check what the doctor of medicine is called.

135
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,980
Is it an indestition?

136
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,260
I can't say this word.

137
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,100
I don't know.

138
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,040
Maybe.

139
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
Great pronunciation.

140
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,920
Thank you!

141
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,860
I am an ENVTuber.

142
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,300
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:48,640
Who?

144
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,680
Spaghetti-chan.

145
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
Indiana gestation.

146
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,040
I think she took meds that make you sillier.

147
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,800
I can't wait to take these new meds, I says.

148
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,120
Little did I know they were the silliest meds.

149
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,900
When you're Indian, you're gestasting.

150
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,820
Larry!

151
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,660
Oh my gosh, you guys.

152
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm gonna miss TikTok so much.

153
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,420
I go on TikTok...

154
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm already crying.

155
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,320
I go on TikTok and I watch Offlane everyday.

156
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,600
Where else will I hear about the creature?

157
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,700
Or Larry?

158
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,720
Or the meatworm?

159
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,580
I'm so sad.

160
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,080
There's your problem.

161
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,700
I don't think I'll be good enough to sing tomorrow.

162
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,120
Indie station.

163
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,480
All aboard!

164
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,040
If you see David Lynch's ghost at the cafe on his way up, will you tell him hi, please?

165
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,920
I will.

166
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,240
I don't think that guy's a ghost, though.

167
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,700
That guy's probably already beyond.

168
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,120
Sad about TikTok?

169
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,080
I am.

170
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,500
You can call me silly.

171
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,420
You can call me so silly for being sad about TikTok.

172
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,780
But...

173
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,580
Oh my gosh.

174
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,400
I was talking to a friend about it.

175
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,420
Actually, when I was thinking about it, TikTok is my only...

176
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,960
First of all, I get a lot of inspiration from there.

177
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,760
I'll find games, I'll find skits that inspire me.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,440
Things that inspire me to do stuff.

179
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,900
And then, also...

180
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:17,300
When I was talking to her about it, it's my one platform that I have no relation to VTuber stuff.

181
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,340
Get well soon!

182
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,880
Thank you!

183
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:32,440
It's my one place that I can super disconnect.

184
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,320
Now I'm just like, I don't have anything.

185
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,300
I don't have anything that I really need to turn my brain off from.

186
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,100
Because, you know, I go through Twitter and I'm just like...

187
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,300
I go through YouTube, everywhere.

188
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,100
So I'm just kind of...

189
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,680
Sorry, I was putting on chapstick.

190
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,300
It's like my one place where I get...

191
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,820
Obviously, my For You page is really catered to me, but it's all super duper random stuff.

192
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,580
I feel like with YouTube, it's just like, oh, I'm searching this specific thing.

193
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,360
And then I watch it, you know what I mean?

194
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,680
Nico Nico Douga.

195
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,820
I just like to be able to scroll and get a random thing.

196
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,660
I'll be like, oh, I'll get a random video about, I don't know, some lake.

197
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,640
Like Lake Baikal or something.

198
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,140
I'll be like, learn about that.

199
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,020
I'll be like, wow!

200
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:48,340
It helps me learn about stuff and just watch stuff that I wouldn't actively seek out because I wouldn't know that it exists, you know what I mean?

201
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,480
So I'm so bummed.

202
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,120
I haven't had the chance to say yeah, but thank you for any party last Saturday.

203
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,420
You made my first otaku event unforgettable.

204
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,740
Oh my gosh, I hope you had fun.

205
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,880
I feel so bad about any party though.

206
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,340
I was so sick.

207
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,740
And I like obviously didn't want to cancel.

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,400
So I was just like, oh, but I was like, I feel like I didn't do well at all.

209
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,640
So I feel so bad.

210
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,020
Helps to give you trivia knowledge.

211
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,640
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,520
You know, I know some people are just like, oh, TikTok is a cesspool, which it is.

213
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,580
Don't get me wrong.

214
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,700
But, but my for you page is pretty good.

215
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,720
I think it's a lot of pet videos and interesting facts about lakes.

216
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:48,700
Sorry, I'm really into like, actually, I was really I got into like the a lot of like medieval like side of stuff to.

217
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,940
Break the ice phantom collab with Mimi.

218
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,140
It's funny.

219
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,740
Mimi is not a ghost.

220
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,960
She's not a ghost.

221
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,980
But it's funny.

222
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,560
She actually messaged me last night.

223
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,820
Of course, I was watching her debut.

224
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,320
She's a baku, everybody.

225
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,260
She's a baku.

226
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,480
How do you say that?

227
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,660
Tapir?

228
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,380
Tapir?

229
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,020
Toupee?

230
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,980
But she she did message me.

231
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,760
She's so sweet.

232
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,720
She's I don't want to say what we talked about.

233
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,980
But she like, she's just such a she's just an absolute sweetheart.

234
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,780
So I, you know, if I if she ever wants to collab, of course, I want to collab with her too.

235
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,900
Kidding to throw you.

236
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,220
During you walk in brand new days and lifting oomph for Hoshiga has made my 2025.

237
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,180
Thank you, Minto.

238
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,520
Maybe those songs need to be spun more.

239
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,340
Or played more.

240
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,860
Give her MGS brain rot.

241
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,180
She was talking about games she was wanting to play.

242
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:14,320
I was taking everything in me to be like, hey, Nimi, have you heard of critically acclaimed series Metal Gear Solid?

243
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,000
Have you heard?

244
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,800
Tell her to play Twin Snakes.

245
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,440
Oh my gosh, I thought you said Twin Peaks and I was gonna go.

246
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,220
Oh, oh, sorry.

247
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I know I'm yapping a bit.

248
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,780
It's because I haven't streamed very much this week.

249
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,620
And so I'm like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,920
Somebody put in the comments, VOD watchers, skip to here.

251
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,540
Skip to here for the gameplay.

252
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,920
Is that how I feel about my Twitter?

253
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,380
Mostly just filled with art, cute animals, anime and video games.

254
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,320
Yeah.

255
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't know.

256
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,180
It's like I didn't.

257
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,340
I didn't have like I never talked to anybody on.

258
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:06,460
I didn't like I had one person that I shared TikToks with, like on TikTok, like one person that I allowed to follow me, like my friend.

259
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,440
I know her.

260
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,020
And I never posted anything, but it's just so I don't feel like a lot of people are like, oh, I'm losing this community.

261
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,280
I don't really feel that.

262
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,580
I just feel sad that I'm losing, like, like I said, my one place where I can totally, completely disconnect.

263
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,840
So now I'm going to be even more crazed.

264
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,260
Oh, my God.

265
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,040
You see that Shuichi Ikeda officially retired from his role as Char?

266
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,820
What?

267
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,740
Kind of sad, but I'm really thankful for all his amazing work.

268
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:43,780
What?

269
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,700
Wow, he's been at it for a long time.

270
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,620
I get to be here for one of these.

271
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,200
Thank you.

272
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,660
Thank you.

273
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,040
Hold on.

274
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,140
My phone just went.

275
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Oh, OK.

276
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,420
There was nothing.

277
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,320
Minecraft collab.

278
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,640
I will ask her.

279
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,120
I will say, Nimi, do you want to play Minecraft with me?

280
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,300
We love listening to you.

281
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,540
Yep.

282
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,100
Yep.

283
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,440
Yep.

284
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,720
Yep.

285
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:12,880
Yep.

286
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,040
Yep.

287
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,520
And I know everybody's very excited about the debut, Nimi debut.

288
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,200
But, you know, just a, just a reminder.

289
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:36,500
Obviously, I love Nimi, but a reminder for most VTubers don't go, you know, a lot of VTubers have that rule where it says, please don't go into or please don't say in chat, talk about other VTubers unless I bring them up first.

290
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,060
Kind of yada yada, you know, so I'm OK with talking about Nimi, of course.

291
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,380
She's my oshi.

292
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,540
But a, but a, not to, I know everybody is very excited and when you're very excited and when you're just like, I hope so and so collab, I hope so and so collab.

293
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,420
Just a, just remember to be kind of respectful about that rule.

294
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,700
I know it's very easy, though, to get so excited about something and want to ask and ask.

295
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,780
But a, I didn't get a plushie.

296
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,440
No, I was eating burrito.

297
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:19,740
I was eating a burrito when the shop went up and I didn't get to have, I didn't get to get the plushie.

298
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,470
Sold out so fast.

299
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,540
But I'm very happy for her that she had such a successful debut and she's so cute.

300
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,500
So, so, so, so, so, so happy.

301
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,180
Yeah, yeah.

302
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,400
Minky may yap, so true.

303
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,800
Minky may yap.

304
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Sad you, oh, thank you, that reminds me, that reminds me actually.

305
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:53,460
Speaking of, speaking of some merch, I have two things to say about merch.

306
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,900
About my own merch.

307
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,700
Akari, your profile picture is so, so cursed.

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,340
Please, please.

309
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:10,860
First thing is that Mosobox posted a little picture on Twitter about maybe some orders getting prepped and ready.

310
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:29,680
But also, another thing, so, so if you ordered like the block or the plushie, the first round of plushies, I believe the second round of plushies were close to capping that.

311
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:41,740
So, if you have not gotten that, and if you are thinking, I really want the plushie, the second round is going to be capped soon.

312
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,380
Hot dog.

313
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,420
Hot dog.

314
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,660
VOD watchers, skip to 0, 0, 0 for banging intro and fun goals.

315
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,740
Oh, wait, oh, oh, sorry, I just, wait, oh, the donors are behind.

316
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,280
Wait, oh, gosh, I read that wrong.

317
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,480
If you do decide to do TikTok marathon on Sunday, may I suggest you do it in 3D so we can see you laughing and wiggling to them.

318
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,260
I will consider.

319
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,540
Now you have a Switch 2 and we almost have Minecraft 2.

320
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,220
Switch 2 came out of nowhere.

321
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,740
I don't really follow leaks stuff or anything like that, so for me, it came out of nowhere.

322
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,220
People were like, um, it really didn't come out of nowhere.

323
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,180
Um, actually, I already knew all of this stuff.

324
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,280
Well, I didn't.

325
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:38,980
But, um, well, merch, merch, so, um, hopefully orders will be going out soon, so maybe pay attention to see if you get a little shipped.

326
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,420
I don't know if they do shipped emails.

327
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,880
I assume they do, but maybe be on the lookout for that.

328
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,780
And the second thing, second thing.

329
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,860
Any party was a blast, brain worms be gone.

330
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,400
Meat worm in my brain.

331
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,880
Um, okay.

332
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,060
Second thing is, um, that I know I just had.

333
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,660
Merch drop.

334
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,660
This is the only time I'm going to bring this up, but I know I just had merch drop not too long ago.

335
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,420
My first ever merch drop, but.

336
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,580
Sooner than you may think.

337
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,540
There may be.

338
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,100
Merch drop.

339
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,940
Maybe.

340
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,100
I say, I say sooner than it, but that's I'm going to say.

341
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm going to say that it's different merch this time.

342
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,420
Different merch, like brand new.

343
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,700
I'm going to say that I don't plan on doing merch very like, you know, super duper often.

344
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:54,140
But the timing of this kind of, uh, because it took a while for the first round of stuff to, to, uh, to go out.

345
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,440
So don't, I hope you don't say that.

346
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,520
Don't think like, uh, oh my God, she's already putting out more merch.

347
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,300
My wallet.

348
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,040
She's going to be putting out merch every month.

349
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,120
No, no, no.

350
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,460
So don't worry.

351
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,380
Well, this next set of merch I'm very excited about.

352
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,700
There was one thing that I wanted to include that I don't think got done in time.

353
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,640
So it will be included in the next, next round of whatever, whatever I make.

354
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,760
Yeah, every week.

355
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,500
But, uh, you're going to make my wallet cry more than the average.

357
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,440
Don't super chat then!

358
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
But yeah, so.

359
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,880
I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.

360
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,600
It's, like I said, it's still a ways away.

361
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,320
It might coincide with a certain upcoming holiday.

362
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,800
That is all I will say.

363
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,480
Excited for MGS board game getting shipped out?

364
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,480
Oh my gosh, I did get that email too!

365
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,280
I got the Metal Gear board game like a year ago.

366
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,560
I pre-ordered it, so.

367
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,460
Wait, did I read that?

368
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,060
Milk day?

369
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,400
Oh, no, MLK day.

370
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,040
Milk.

371
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,240
Speaking of Gundam earlier, the new Gundam show has an insert song by VTuber.

372
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,460
I did see that!

373
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,540
Suisei, yeah.

374
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,720
Exciting stuff.

375
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,780
When's the Valentine's merch, and the summer merch, and the Halloween merch, and the anniversary merch, and the return anniversary...

376
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,100
No!

377
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,140
Stop it!

378
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,580
Stop it.

379
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,580
I also want to remind you guys that...

380
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,800
March 10th is Minto day.

381
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,420
Set your calendars.

382
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,600
We got to go big for Minto day this year.

383
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,040
I don't know what we're doing.

384
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,280
We got to figure out a day for Minky day too.

385
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,780
Thank you for the pink.

386
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
Also looking forward to more Minto...

387
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,500
Merch.

388
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,640
Minto, sorry.

389
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,240
I think...

390
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,380
I don't know if I'm actually dyslexic, but I think it's acting up really badly today.

391
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,140
I love watching you play DMC.

392
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,200
I grew up playing these classics.

393
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,560
Did you end up deciding to skip too?

394
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,280
No, Fib, I played it.

395
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,480
I played it.

396
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,180
I played it.

397
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,820
I one-shotted it.

398
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,520
I one-shotted it.

399
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,220
So it's just one stream.

400
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,260
You can just put it on in the background.

401
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,220
Since we're doing reminders, I'd like to remind everyone that I'm Minto Cute.

402
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,980
Thank you for the very spooky Super Chat, Murphy.

403
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,820
Don't buy Super Chats.

404
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,520
No snowball.

405
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,720
Don't do it.

406
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,620
Nicholas, call my bank for a loan.

407
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,400
No!

408
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,120
Thank you.

409
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,620
Time to refund my speed dating.

410
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,240
No!

411
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,180
Long awaited sequel to Minto merch.

412
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,100
Minto merch 2.

413
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Don't forget the electric boogaloo.

414
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,260
Char's original VA just retired from the role.

415
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,920
Yeah, someone told me earlier.

416
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,400
How soon is that?

417
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,620
People are freaking out about it right now.

418
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,380
Did it just happen?

419
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,860
Five minutes ago, did they post the announcement?

420
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,180
Char's VA!

421
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,440
Char?

422
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,480
Char?

423
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Char's VA is graduating!

424
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,300
Wait, she didn't start yet?

425
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,800
No, sorry.

426
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,840
I'm a yapping monster right now.

427
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,600
Okay.

428
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,380
Well, we can start now, I think.

429
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,500
I think we can start now.

430
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,080
Maybe I should have done the Super Chat.

431
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,800
Not Super Chat.

432
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,500
Free Chat.

433
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,700
Maybe.

434
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,840
Maybe.

435
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:50,940
Maybe.

436
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,010
Devil may cry.

437
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:03,750
Footage as gory, violent, will make your grandma cry.

438
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,750
Just see?

439
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,950
Thanks for the five gifted.

440
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,690
Green soup off a green woman.

441
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,190
Thanks for the five gifted.

442
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,190
Is the audio okay?

443
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,890
We must watch every time.

444
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,370
It might be in the way.

445
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,970
That might be better.

446
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,730
Evil.

447
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,610
Cloudy with a chance of devil crying.

448
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,170
Where are the meatballs?

449
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,030
Show me the meatballs!

450
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,310
Meatballs.

451
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,570
So-called legend.

452
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,490
Why is she saying it like that?

453
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,890
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted.

454
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,730
So-called legend.

455
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,350
She hates them.

456
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,730
She hates them.

457
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,510
She hates them.

458
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,190
Oh my god, Swirly.

459
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,470
I hope your luck turns around.

460
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,260
I'm gonna... That's...

461
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,760
That's not me.

462
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,660
That didn't happen.

463
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,000
He's so stiff when he falls.

464
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,660
It's like he turns into like...

465
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,720
He gets shot with like a...

466
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,200
Stiffy beam.

467
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,490
Skeletal Guzzler.

468
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,950
Wow, look at the membership.

469
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,490
Don't call it that.

470
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,330
Wait, what is that?

471
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,470
What did I say?

472
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,130
Wait, what did I say?

473
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,950
Is that not good?

474
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,450
No.

475
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:21,910
Not

476
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
a good word.

477
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,160
Wait.

478
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,620
Just ignore I said that.

479
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,280
Cut it from the tapes.

480
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,260
Editor.

481
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,020
Cut it from the tapes.

482
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,100
Oh my god.

483
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,120
I don't know anything you guys.

484
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't know anything.

485
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,380
Okay.

486
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,880
I made another save because I was scared.

487
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,160
I don't remember why.

488
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,440
Oh, because I was scared.

489
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,520
Okay.

490
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,940
Let's just go.

491
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,240
Let's just start the game.

492
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,140
What am I?

493
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,660
What am I?

494
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm on...

495
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,580
I'm on...

496
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,720
Oh, I cleared it.

497
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,300
I cleared it.

498
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:26,500
Okay.

499
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,240
I need scissor 61.

500
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,780
True.

501
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,940
Don't worry, the VOD watchers won't see that.

502
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,020
The gameplay starts now.

503
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,340
Link the gameplay here.

504
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,880
This is the mission.

505
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,820
Wait, what do you mean?

506
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,260
Don't say that.

507
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,780
I'm scared.

508
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,700
Why do you guys always say that?

509
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,340
I'm scared.

510
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,140
I'm scared.

511
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,900
Oh yeah, we have to look for the 13.

512
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,480
I'm scanning.

513
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,000
13.

514
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:07,740
13.

515
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,040
Is it gonna be the blood?

516
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,640
Oh, he's trembling.

517
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,640
Little baby.

518
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,480
The blood will form 13.

519
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,820
13.

520
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,240
I need to pay attention to what's going on and not just looking for numbers.

521
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,220
The numbers.

522
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,940
Oh, I see it!

523
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,800
In the wall!

524
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I saw it!

525
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,880
Chaos' warm welcome.

526
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,020
Oh no, battle of blood and of brothers.

527
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,940
Brothers.

528
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,220
Battle of blood and of brothers.

529
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,400
Battle of blood and of brothers.

530
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,760
No.

531
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,480
No, he just...last time he absorbed the power of Beowulf.

532
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,360
Oh, bro.

533
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,100
What's that?

534
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,040
Oh gosh.

535
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,880
Oh not...oh wait.

536
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,600
Okay, I have 25,000 roars.

537
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:37,580
Hey Mint, are you free to hang out in exactly one month of random Friday and watch a movie Nacho Libre and then walk on the beach talking about Nacho Libre and then get dinner so we can keep talking about Nacho Libre?

538
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,360
I already watched Nacho Libre.

539
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,100
You weren't even there, fake fan.

540
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,380
Not of me, of Nacho Libre.

541
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,840
Blorb or porb?

542
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,440
That's a great question.

543
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,060
I think a porb.

544
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,940
But first also let me see my actions.

545
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,340
I must reflect.

546
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,560
This one I don't think I'm gonna...

547
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,780
There's agony and root drop.

548
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,040
Before I get anything...

549
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,380
Before I get anything, let's try the fight.

550
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:15,920
You know?

551
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,380
Before I get anything.

552
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,180
I think we'll try it.

553
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,300
I haven't seen the DMC anime.

554
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,640
Will it be a...

555
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,200
What does it...

556
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,940
What game does it...

557
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,460
What game does it animate?

558
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,360
You got me to redownload DMC5.

559
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,640
It's between...

560
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,100
Between 1 and 2.

561
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,500
I feel like you guys told me this before actually.

562
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,040
Sorry if I forgot.

563
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,820
Mission start.

564
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,280
I don't even know what I have.

565
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,000
What do I have?

566
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,140
Checkmate.

567
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,550
What the hell is this?

568
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,570
Oh my god.

569
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,950
I think I can shoot these things.

570
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,610
What am I...

571
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,250
I did not mean to do that.

572
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:29,530
Sorry.

573
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,710
Hold on.

574
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:31,390
Oh my god.

575
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,850
Oh, ok.

576
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,210
So red... I remember.

577
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:36,930
I remember.

578
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,870
Red means attack.

579
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:39,810
Ok.

580
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,790
I remember these guys.

581
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,310
I remember.

582
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:42,150
Ok.

583
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,690
Nice, nice.

584
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,530
He's about to attack.

585
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,280
Sorry.

586
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,360
I'm getting back into it, everybody.

587
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,220
Stinger!

588
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:11,960
Stinger!

589
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:12,700
Stinger!

590
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,520
Ok.

591
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,780
Nice.

592
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,560
Nice.

593
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,640
Ouch.

594
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:28,980
Ouch.

595
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,080
Ouch.

596
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,720
I knew it was going to attack and I still went for it.

597
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,340
Because I'm an idiot.

598
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,180
I was going to say easy.

599
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,200
Oh shoot.

600
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,720
More?

601
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,140
Double?

602
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,500
Double?

603
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,380
Oh, door.

604
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,380
Let's get rid of these guys.

605
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,920
Ok.

606
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,960
Nice, nice, nice.

607
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,360
Ok.

608
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,560
Can you stop crowning each other?

609
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,570
There we go.

610
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,230
Failure?

611
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,310
Ok.

612
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,260
Sorry.

613
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,860
Ok.

614
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,940
We're back.

615
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,620
We're back in.

616
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,320
We're back in.

617
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,800
Sorry.

618
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,120
Spiral staircase.

619
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,500
They weren't kidding.

620
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,780
It's not a euphemism.

621
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,280
Real spiral staircase.

622
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,840
Ouch.

623
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,720
I hate this.

624
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,080
I

625
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,330
don't think I want to be doing this.

626
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,990
Oh my god.

627
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,510
Oh my god.

628
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,190
Oh my god.

629
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,470
I want out of here please.

630
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,490
Spider city.

631
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,730
Oh gosh.

632
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:54,770
Oh gosh.

633
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,350
They are so fast.

634
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,060
No, no.

635
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,680
That's not what I meant.

636
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,040
You know what?

637
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,280
Fine.

638
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,540
You know what?

639
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,080
Wasn't they weak?

640
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,840
They are weak against the ice or something?

641
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:16,820
Jump!

642
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,570
Oh fire.

643
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,030
The complete opposite.

644
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,970
They are so rude.

645
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,350
No, no, no.

646
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,890
Oh my god.

647
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,930
We are killing them.

648
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,250
We are killing ourselves too.

649
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,480
Nice.

650
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,760
Oh, not nice.

651
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:58,980
Warp.

652
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,340
Oh shoot.

653
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,680
Fire that.

654
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm not going to live.

655
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,040
I'm not going to live.

656
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,060
I'll never live through this.

657
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,440
I wasn't ready.

658
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,860
I don't want the secret.

659
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,540
Please!

660
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,320
Let me out!

661
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,500
We are fine.

662
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:23,540
Again?

663
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,470
Anyway.

664
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,490
Just ignore the health.

665
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,230
Get back in there.

666
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,370
You can't make me.

667
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:43,630
What's in here?

668
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,230
Hell's highway.

669
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,910
Sounds trendy.

670
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,650
What's in there?

671
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,830
That's a blorb.

672
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,010
We need to get in there.

673
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,450
Do you think?

674
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,570
Oh no, I can't.

675
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,130
I was going to say the one that makes you fly.

676
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,670
Highway to hell.

677
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,790
I'm on the highway to hell.

678
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,500
Get it later?

679
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:23,900
Okay.

680
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,520
Who's going to ambush me in these hallways?

681
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,560
There it is.

682
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,940
It's this again.

683
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,380
Nice.

684
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,440
What if I just shoot from far away?

685
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,300
Wait.

686
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,440
There we go.

687
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,260
Blast!

688
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,420
Blast!

689
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,540
Alright!

690
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,080
Alright!

691
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh yeah!

692
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,200
Oh no!

693
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,980
Oh no!

694
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,200
I can't believe this is working.

695
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,580
Sniper gameplay.

696
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,100
Yeah, it works.

697
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,040
If it works it...

698
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,420
I'll take that.

699
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,320
No, no, no.

700
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,220
I panicked.

701
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,160
It's working though.

702
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,720
For real.

703
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,000
I need to be able to see it.

704
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,000
Blip, blip!

705
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,280
It's working though.

706
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,390
Okay, I think I'm done.

707
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Nice!

708
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,540
Sniper may cry.

709
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,060
Jack!

710
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,960
Oh Jack, welcome to membership.

711
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,160
Thank you!

712
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,240
Okay, so we have a door there.

713
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:26,860
Hold on.

714
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,640
This is like the longest... the most doors I've seen in this game.

715
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,280
What is that up there?

716
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,000
Devil's door!

717
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,220
It pays to explore.

718
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,520
We love that.

719
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:43,980
Nice.

720
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,680
Well, if it isn't Saucy Jack.

721
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,220
That's truly Saucy Jack there.

722
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,220
Okay, so door here...

723
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,020
And what's down here?

724
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,400
Wait a second, sorry.

725
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,040
Why?

726
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,800
My camera's been a little weird lately.

727
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,540
Okay, and a door here.

728
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,380
Let's go into door number one.

729
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,880
That's...

730
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,020
Vestibule.

731
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,020
Oh, it's a light puzzle.

732
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
What do I need to light up?

733
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,820
Oh, the crack?

734
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,900
What is it?

735
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,080
Maybe...

736
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,040
Oh, it just resets the puzzle.

737
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,340
Okay, let's see.

738
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,380
Goes from there...

739
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,940
If I...

740
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,020
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

741
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,780
Okay, okay, okay.

742
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,200
I messed up.

743
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,280
Nice, okay.

744
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,420
We definitely probably need to get rid of this one.

745
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,440
So destroy.

746
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:20,930
Destroy.

747
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,290
Oh, it doesn't need to go to the crack?

748
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:23,430
The crack...

749
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,290
The crack is...

750
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:29,450
Different?

751
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,020
Wait, but then...

752
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,740
Then, what is this one?

753
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,210
Aura Halkon.

754
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:58,230
A perfectly formed piece of Aura Halkon.

755
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,630
I know what that is.

756
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,490
Said to open the door to the lair of judgment.

757
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,850
These names are starting to sound more and more Kingdom Hearts-y, I swear.

758
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,410
Did someone say the lair of judgment?

759
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:19,150
Didn't fall for the puzzle's tricks because she forgot it.

760
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,110
No, because I'm so smart.

761
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,330
Most likely.

762
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,290
I just saw the crack first.

763
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,250
I didn't need these stupid tricks.

764
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,250
I didn't need...

765
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:48,690
Ouch,

766
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,680
ouch, ouch, ouch.

767
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,330
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

768
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,530
I'm going back to gunslinger.

769
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:11,170
Oh, shoot.

770
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,410
Oh, it's healing them, you bastard!

771
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,490
There we go.

772
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,120
Where were you guys before?

773
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,880
Got him before he could do anything.

774
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,480
These...

775
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,020
These camera angles are really sending me...

776
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,800
Oh, shoot.

777
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,940
I did not realize.

778
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,940
I should have realized, but I'm stupid.

779
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,560
Stop healing them!

780
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,100
I hurt faster than they can heal.

781
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,620
I don't like this one, so we just keep shooting him.

782
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,480
I can't see!

783
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,660
Lips in your eyes.

784
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,860
OK, screw you, screw you, screw you!

785
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,140
Oh, I did it.

786
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,360
The eye can see.

787
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,660
Press the gunslinger button.

788
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,680
Minky, I'm glad you're getting better just in time for DMC3.

789
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,920
Also, today is my birthday.

790
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,060
Have a happy birthday song.

791
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,420
Of course, it's the best!

792
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,580
Happy birthday to you!

793
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,620
Happy birthday to you!

794
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,860
Happy birthday, dear Saiko!

795
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,360
Happy birthday to you!

796
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,500
Happy birthday!

797
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,300
Time.

798
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,820
Sexy lion.

799
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,460
I didn't buy anything before.

800
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,080
I think I'm still trying to decide.

801
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,270
That was a devil trigger?

802
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,610
Why did you give me that?

803
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,110
What is this?

804
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,510
Offer up the ore, halcon and proceed...

805
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,550
Wait!

806
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,230
I didn't get to explore the rest!

807
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:30,870
OK, nevermind.

808
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:31,190
Goodbye.

809
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:33,590
Hold on.

810
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,910
Hold your horses.

811
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,240
How do I get to the blorb?

812
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,040
I would have to use this guy, but...

813
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,680
I can barely do...

814
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,600
I can barely do five.

815
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,030
Read the file.

816
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:22,730
Thanks for the super chat!

817
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,730
I hope you're OK.

818
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:23,790
OK.

819
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:30,670
Yeah,

820
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,690
some blorbs just don't need to be gotten.

821
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:39,230
So true.

822
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,750
So true!

823
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,450
This is scaring me, guys.

824
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:47,870
Save.

825
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,310
Let's just try.

826
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,170
Tell me how hard is he really...

827
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:10,490
Is there something missing?

828
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:21,550
Is there something missing?

829
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,450
Wow.

830
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:31,070
Chat!

831
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,630
No, Dante!

832
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:54,230
No!

833
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,930
Yeah, it doesn't matter who's blood goes in.

834
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:03,990
No!

835
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,490
No!

836
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:09,970
No, please!

837
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:21,510
Please!

838
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,170
Please don't come over here, Virgil!

839
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,750
Oh my God!

840
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:26,990
Oh my God!

841
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,300
Oh my God!

842
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:42,920
I parried him!

843
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,140
Because I'm so good at this game!

844
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,460
That's not what I meant.

845
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,740
Oh my... He's parrying me.

846
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:58,860
Oh,

847
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,390
stop parrying me, you little...

848
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,990
OK,

849
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,900
that's when I can get him.

850
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,040
After he does his little tricks.

851
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,880
Now I'm motivated!

852
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:16,620
No!

853
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,840
Stop, please!

854
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,700
Do your little trick, please.

855
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,360
Oh my God.

856
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,080
He parries so...

857
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,980
Oh, shoot.

858
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,600
I didn't parry him there.

859
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,520
Oh, damn!

860
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,160
OK.

861
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,960
I'm just doing whatever.

862
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,160
Wait, I don't know.

863
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,960
I couldn't tell if he was... Oh, damn.

864
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:51,920
OK, OK.

865
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,900
Oh my God.

866
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,180
Chill

867
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,750
out!

868
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,630
I'm gonna die.

869
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:12,210
There we go.

870
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:12,690
It's OK.

871
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,350
It's OK!

872
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,170
OK, OK, OK.

873
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,270
I don't think Stinger really works.

874
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,530
OK.

875
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,270
I'm scared of Phase 2.

876
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,200
Ah, damn!

877
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,360
There we go.

878
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,120
Damn it!

879
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,500
Damn!

880
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,620
Oh, shoot.

881
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,540
I tried to...

882
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,020
Ah, damn it!

883
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,660
Oh my God!

884
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,500
The timing is so... small.

885
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,920
I get two feet from him!

886
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,380
Maybe fight back.

887
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,720
Oh no, what is this?

888
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,740
What is this?

889
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,720
What is this?

890
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,100
He's also got a demon form!

891
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,210
OK.

892
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,710
He double triggered.

893
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,390
OK, that doesn't do anything.

894
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,050
That's fine.

895
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,790
I was just trying to build up double trigger for me.

896
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,090
OK, OK, OK.

897
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,090
He heals in DTN?

898
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,250
No, shut up.

899
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,390
Oh, shoot.

900
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,750
I parried.

901
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:15,630
Oh,

902
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:19,810
shit!

903
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,060
Do I

904
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,700
have any items?

905
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,120
Glad to hear your voice is doing better.

906
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:32,920
Thanks.

907
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,860
Who took a mickey?

908
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,500
I don't know.

909
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,360
Thanks for joining MappaShift.

910
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,700
Welcome to MappaShift!

911
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:41,580
Don't!

912
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,420
It won't be enough!

913
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,340
Give it a few more tries first.

914
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,300
OK, still I feel like this is...

915
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,660
I will die, but I feel like this is a nice try, second round, you know?

916
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,540
Don't give yourself a bronchitis too!

917
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,080
I don't have a bronchitis, I have a boonkitis.

918
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,540
Sorry, it looks better in text than it says saying out loud.

919
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,820
Virgil's tooth theme is the one they use in MV...

920
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,260
Oh, is that the Marvel vs.

921
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:16,760
Capcom?

922
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,980
Now known as the theme of your opponent is going to kill your entire team.

923
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,680
Oh, I wish.

924
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,880
I don't know why I tried the stinger there.

925
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,340
I just instinctively go for the stinger sometimes.

926
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,740
NT, NT, NT, NT, NT.

927
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,260
Blackshot still built DT.

928
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,580
Is that true now?

929
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,120
I don't know.

930
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:13,300
I'm on part 5 of this playthrough of this game and I didn't know that.

931
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,300
That's OK, that's OK.

932
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,100
Mito screamed louder than last time she met Doki.

933
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:21,860
What do you mean?

934
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,440
I think it's because my settings are a little different.

935
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,320
I will have to adjust them a little bit.

936
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:36,600
Actually, some people may not know but I got a new computer as of yesterday.

937
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,580
Did you know Ace Combat 7 just hit 6 million units sold yesterday?

938
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,160
I did!

939
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,800
You guys saved my franchise.

940
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,520
Happy for you, Nan.

941
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,160
That was the most heartfelt and primal scream of fear I've ever heard in my life.

942
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,440
I was scared.

943
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:08,420
I have a new PC and so I was setting stuff up with everything today.

944
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,480
So my sound settings might be a little bit different.

945
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:21,820
I apologize in advance if they sound not as good.

946
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,980
But my PC is so pretty.

947
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,220
Actually, there's one thing... I do have to take it back.

948
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,720
Because there's one thing that isn't working.

949
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,240
It's a minor thing.

950
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,560
Obviously, it's still usable.

951
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:46,780
I bought all the parts and then basically took it somewhere to get put together.

952
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,380
Because I don't know how to do that.

953
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,520
But yeah.

954
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:54,840
Assembled.

955
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:55,780
Yeah, assembled.

956
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,760
Are the cables bundled super neatly?

957
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,720
They are.

958
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:08,440
Maybe once it's completely working, I will take a photo.

959
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,520
And it's also very quiet.

960
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,480
Oh my gosh.

961
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,320
My last computer had issues with the fans rumbling and rattling.

962
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,600
Also, the fans in general were kind of loud.

963
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:25,220
Even streaming, I don't hear it at all.

964
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,440
I don't hear it.

965
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,280
Streaming setups are kind of beefy, especially as a VTuber.

966
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,020
And I don't hear anything.

967
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,340
It's so quiet.

968
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,940
It's so nice.

969
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:42,620
Hmm.

970
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,600
Yeah, I'm really happy about it.

971
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,260
And everything is running so smoothly.

972
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,000
I was having issues with my monitors.

973
01:01:51,680 --> 01:02:00,760
Every time my monitors in my old PC would go to sleep, when they turned back on, they would resize my entire screen.

974
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,400
They would disconnect and reconnect.

975
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,680
And no matter what I did on my computer, it wouldn't fix it.

976
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,940
And I tried so much stuff.

977
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,420
And so, some windows, it would resize and then I would have to fix everything in OBS.

978
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,980
Because it would resize stuff and then stuff in OBS would break.

979
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,300
And it was just frustrating me.

980
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:29,180
Because I would have to re-fix everything every day.

981
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,460
It was so annoying.

982
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,840
Sorry, a little mini rant before virtual again.

983
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:43,700
And so, now I don't have that problem anymore.

984
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,760
I'm so, so happy.

985
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,840
I tested it earlier.

986
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,860
It didn't resize anything.

987
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,480
I'm so happy.

988
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,720
I'm getting 30 burgers for dinner.

989
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:53,780
Who wants what?

990
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:54,640
I want a burger.

991
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,480
I want a cucumber on my burger, please.

992
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,220
Cucumber burger, please.

993
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,760
What am I doing with my old PC?

994
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,260
I'm keeping it as a backup, actually.

995
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,160
Just in case anything happens, you know.

996
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,180
I think it's always safe.

997
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:15,760
Because I actually don't have a PC that would be like a backup in case...

998
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:18,900
Wait, wrong chat.

999
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,400
No!

1000
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,060
Mustache man, no!

1001
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,260
Thank you for the...

1002
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,980
Akadono... I mean, Zaka Super, thank you!

1003
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,260
Thank you!

1004
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,540
So, no burgers?

1005
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,560
Yeah, wait.

1006
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,240
What about the burgers?

1007
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,940
But yeah...

1008
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,680
Better PC to play old games, better Minecraft.

1009
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,160
I wonder.

1010
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:06,060
I wonder now though if this PC could play Indiana Jones.

1011
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,040
I want five guys in me and five guys out of me.

1012
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,660
That's called the...

1013
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,820
The digestive system.

1014
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,520
Guys, don't say ew, it's natural.

1015
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,160
All humans poop, don't they?

1016
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,460
You eat the burger and then you poop out the burger.

1017
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,680
You better hope you poop out the burger.

1018
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,580
What?

1019
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,600
It has to come out somewhere?

1020
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:47,790
This is the welcome to...

1021
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:49,790
Biology with Minto.

1022
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,390
Biology.

1023
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:54,550
No, sorry, I meant...

1024
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:56,510
Bintology.

1025
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,030
Ghosts don't poop?

1026
01:04:59,170 --> 01:04:59,430
No.

1027
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:01,490
No, no, no.

1028
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:06,430
All food, basically, is like, you know...

1029
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,430
Well, like, I show you my legs on stream, but like, I usually...

1030
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,290
Have like a little wispy tail, you know?

1031
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,310
It takes a lot of energy to have legs.

1032
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:22,770
So...

1033
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:27,870
No bumhole.

1034
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:31,750
Just a little wisp bottom, you know?

1035
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:37,670
No,

1036
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,670
I'm not gonna show you my wisp tail on stream.

1037
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,250
What the...

1038
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,570
That's so embarrassing.

1039
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,370
What is this room called?

1040
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,710
The lab of judgment?

1041
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,870
I like the biblically act...

1042
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,730
I forgot I was fighting someone right now.

1043
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,940
Oh, I meant to jump.

1044
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,080
Not doing so hot.

1045
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,920
I don't know how to get out of that once I'm in it.

1046
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,000
I can't jump or do anything.

1047
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,140
Shihan, welcome to membership!

1048
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,400
Thank you!

1049
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:51,450
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1050
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:55,970
Gosh.

1051
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,510
At

1052
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,910
least he doesn't avoid this.

1053
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,460
I don't know if this does anything, but it does build DT at the very least.

1054
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,820
How do I... I know how to taunt.

1055
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,350
You taunt me, I taunt you.

1056
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,250
Come on!

1057
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:14,130
Nice!

1058
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:21,350
Nice dodge.

1059
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,460
Come on, weep.

1060
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,500
Come on, weep.

1061
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,440
I'm trying to do slow and steady, you guys.

1062
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,140
I know I'm not being very aggressive.

1063
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,780
I'm still like... I'm just letting him stall out his DT.

1064
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,540
I know he heals.

1065
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,520
He doesn't heal a ton, it seems.

1066
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:43,880
There we go.

1067
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,080
Let's bait him.

1068
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,810
Ah, shoot!

1069
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,720
Ok, now we gotta...

1070
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,980
We gotta make him waste out... Run out of DT for him.

1071
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,720
I don't want him getting any hits on me.

1072
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,540
We just let him...

1073
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:42,520
Where are you going?

1074
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,660
There we go.

1075
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,400
I'm actually gonna let mine go for a bit.

1076
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,730
Why isn't it working anymore?

1077
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:14,650
You bastard!

1078
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:18,030
You bastard, you...

1079
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:29,070
Slow and steady, slow and steady, slow and steady.

1080
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,640
You think your name is Wimp at this point?

1081
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:40,680
Wimpy, wimpy!

1082
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,540
Wimpy, wimpy!

1083
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,980
Ok, I'm building up a little bit more.

1084
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,960
A little bit more, a little bit more.

1085
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,820
Oh no, no, no!

1086
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,900
No, no, no, no!

1087
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,060
Shoot!

1088
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,020
Shoot!

1089
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,260
No, no, no!

1090
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,380
Oh my God!

1091
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,080
Shoot!

1092
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,280
Shoot!

1093
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:18,580
Shoot!

1094
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:18,900
Shoot!

1095
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,140
Shoot!

1096
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:19,440
Shoot!

1097
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:19,700
Shoot!

1098
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:19,880
Shoot!

1099
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Shoot!

1100
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:20,640
Oh my God!

1101
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,080
Oh shoot, this is bad.

1102
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,260
Everything is bad here.

1103
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,460
That was not good at all.

1104
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,660
That was so...

1105
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,180
That was so bad, that was so bad.

1106
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,260
We were just standing there.

1107
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,300
Come on, Wimpy!

1108
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,620
Punch in air?

1109
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,320
For real?

1110
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,680
I have more weapons.

1111
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,940
I know, but like...

1112
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,790
This one has air.

1113
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,290
This one puts me in the air.

1114
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:59,690
It's the best one I have to avoid his attacks.

1115
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,300
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

1116
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:10,320
I'm scared.

1117
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,780
I'm not gonna beat this, but...

1118
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:37,740
Oh

1119
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,160
gosh, scary, scary, scary.

1120
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,380
Why can't I get more DT, please?

1121
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:55,620
Are you serious?

1122
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,000
Too far away?

1123
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,320
I wasn't... I was as far away as I was before though.

1124
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,740
There we go.

1125
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,440
That's better.

1126
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:29,770
Oh come on, you bastard!

1127
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:32,990
You bastard!

1128
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:33,530
Good.

1129
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,270
Yeah, I feel like I was probably spamming the taunt, but that's okay.

1130
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,150
That's okay.

1131
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:50,270
I'm wondering if I should buy more... plorb?

1132
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,630
Should I buy the plorb?

1133
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,050
I don't know.

1134
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:06,250
Yes.

1135
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,660
Plorb or plorb.

1136
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:23,860
Eenie meenie miney mo, catch a tiger by his toe, if he hollers let him go, my mom said to pick the very best one and you are it!

1137
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,920
Thank you, pyrobot.

1138
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,820
That's sounding healthy.

1139
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,200
Hang in there and kick his butt.

1140
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:36,920
Thank you!

1141
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,560
30,000.

1142
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,500
It hurts.

1143
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,040
It hurts bad.

1144
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,220
Nice.

1145
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,230
Can I just stand there?

1146
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:20,270
I'm right in front of you.

1147
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,030
Nice, nice, nice.

1148
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:25,510
OK.

1149
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,850
Alright, alright, alright.

1150
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:29,910
Come here.

1151
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:30,490
Come here.

1152
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,820
Where am I?

1153
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,420
Where am I?

1154
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,800
Come on.

1155
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,200
I'm scared.

1156
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,300
Oh shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

1157
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:35,830
Oh shoot.

1158
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:38,670
Ah!

1159
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:39,290
No!

1160
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,010
Shit, shit.

1161
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:57,170
Oh, oh, oh.

1162
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:57,850
It's right in front of me.

1163
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,150
Phase 2, phase 2, phase 2.

1164
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,400
Ah shit.

1165
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,120
Shit, shit, shit!

1166
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:20,880
OK.

1167
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,480
They're nice, nice.

1168
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:25,940
We're full.

1169
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,700
They'll run out.

1170
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:29,840
Eventually.

1171
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:35,830
I don't want him to heal, but...

1172
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,210
I can't get a good angle.

1173
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,770
Give me a good angle, please.

1174
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,570
Just run out, or...

1175
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,710
Just run out.

1176
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:52,410
What

1177
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,520
the hell is this thing, anyway?

1178
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,240
Scum!

1179
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:06,460
Scum.

1180
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,520
Scum.

1181
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:19,540
Scum.

1182
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,920
OK, this is good, this is good.

1183
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,900
Ah shit, shit, shit.

1184
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:34,460
Ah!

1185
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:39,190
You motherfucker.

1186
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,190
I wasted it.

1187
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:42,670
No!

1188
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,070
Now he's healing!

1189
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,250
Come on.

1190
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:50,490
Ah!

1191
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,490
Damn, that was so...

1192
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:53,690
Please let me... No!

1193
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:56,650
No, please let me have some iframes, please!

1194
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:00,410
OK, OK, OK.

1195
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,930
Alright, alright, alright.

1196
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:17,620
Scum!

1197
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,180
I'm missing my opportunities!

1198
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,140
OK, OK, OK.

1199
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,980
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

1200
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:38,600
Really?

1201
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,440
Ah, I miss...

1202
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,060
I miss, I miss, I miss him.

1203
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,020
Come on, man.

1204
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,060
Ah, damn.

1205
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,240
No!

1206
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,300
I'm so close!

1207
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,420
In fact, let me just do this.

1208
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,000
Run, run, run!

1209
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:26,150
Oi!

1210
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,280
Fuck you.

1211
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,800
I'm gonna lose my brain cells.

1212
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,920
Ah, he healed so much.

1213
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,960
This sucks.

1214
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:44,480
Ha!

1215
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,360
Let's go!

1216
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,120
Yeah, we didn't need the Vital Star.

1217
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:20,800
Little sucker.

1218
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:22,380
Oh!

1219
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,700
Damn, lady.

1220
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:43,800
Oh,

1221
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:01,470
no!

1222
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,950
This clown, literally!

1223
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,210
You!

1224
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,150
Hold on, I'm gonna get a cough drop real quick.

1225
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,010
I have another thing.

1226
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,970
Daddy!

1227
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:32,310
Yeah,

1228
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:43,890
I whooped his butt.

1229
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,010
Oh!

1230
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:55,190
Of course.

1231
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,110
There he is.

1232
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:57,750
We all knew it.

1233
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:04,830
Ew!

1234
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,370
Wait, were they working together this whole time?

1235
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:12,870
Oh my God!

1236
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:20,920
Hmm...

1237
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,360
Ah?

1238
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,440
Oi!

1239
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,180
Was it a hallucination?

1240
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,560
Like a...

1241
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:34,700
Not a hallucination, a little...

1242
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:35,760
It wasn't real?

1243
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:37,700
It's the same dude!

1244
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,240
Oh!

1245
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,040
Oh my God!

1246
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,540
Oh!

1247
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:15,660
Oh!

1248
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:20,160
Oh my God!

1249
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,120
Oh, in the butt!

1250
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,000
Oh, nevermind, in the leg.

1251
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,840
It's our...

1252
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,820
I only fought you once.

1253
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:01,820
You don't dress like this normally, but it suits you.

1254
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:01,880
Ew!

1255
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,000
What?

1256
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:08,660
What?

1257
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:09,460
Oh!

1258
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,360
Jinx.

1259
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,320
Haha, yeah baby!

1260
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,080
Oh no!

1261
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,700
Oh no, baby!

1262
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,200
Oh boo!

1263
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:47,920
Oh he's breakdancing!

1264
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:49,880
Oh my God!

1265
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,060
Oh my God!

1266
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:00,890
Blue cheese, thank you for the 20 gifted!

1267
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,370
Oh, sorry.

1268
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:03,770
Sorry.

1269
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,670
Oh no!

1270
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:09,830
Virgil!

1271
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,300
Yeah!

1272
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,940
We did it!

1273
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,960
Nice!

1274
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,140
Nice.

1275
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:39,760
Noice, noice, noice.

1276
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,920
I guess I gotta go now.

1277
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,160
No!

1278
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:44,880
Noice.

1279
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,440
Buoy for bueno.

1280
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:49,720
Yeah!

1281
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:50,560
Si!

1282
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:55,480
One thing I wanna say...

1283
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,160
For people...Oh my goodness, I feel like I have to say this every stream.

1284
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:04,320
I know I'm passive in fights sometimes, but it's just how I play.

1285
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:12,700
I have to warm up a bit and kind of read how things are before I go all crazy willy nilly.

1286
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,940
So you don't have to be in chat being like screaming...

1287
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:19,100
Finally, be more aggressive.

1288
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,380
Stop being so passive.

1289
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,160
You don't have to be so aggressive in chat, okay?

1290
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,000
So, you know, it's just how I play.

1291
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,340
And if that bothers you, you don't have to watch, you know?

1292
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:42,620
It's because if I go in all crazy, I get flustered and then I end up making crazy mistakes.

1293
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:53,800
So I kind of gotta like back off and read the situation and then go in and then back off and read the situation.

1294
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:58,320
It's just how I gotta do.

1295
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,460
So sorry.

1296
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,660
I'll

1297
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,000
literally explode.

1298
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,620
Gotta find your bearings first.

1299
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,300
Yeah, it's just kind of how I do.

1300
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,080
I know it's not everybody.

1301
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,160
Everybody gets impatient.

1302
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,160
I'm sorry.

1303
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,480
I'm sorry.

1304
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,720
Wow, it looks like a cannon.

1305
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,320
If we're going to... If we're opening the gates of hell, why are we going up?

1306
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:57,590
Is it just because it's more epic to fight on top of a big tower?

1307
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:02,390
Okay.

1308
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:03,530
RGB tower.

1309
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:09,270
You should watch some combo map videos when you finish the game so you can see smoking sexy style.

1310
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:19,890
Play how you learn.

1311
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:20,450
Thanks Brandon!

1312
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:27,610
Doesn't... What about her leg?

1313
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,460
She's walking it off.

1314
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,120
Tis a flesh wound.

1315
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,060
Trickster Dash gives a lot of iframes.

1316
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,620
Seems to suit your playstyle more.

1317
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,200
I'm so sorry for backseeking.

1318
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:52,840
No worries.

1319
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,120
The reason I...

1320
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,560
Here, let's wait for the cutscene.

1321
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:03,100
Are we going to get Virgil?

1322
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,060
The reason... Oh, 14!

1323
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:19,160
The reason I sometimes don't use Trickster is because I find the dash to be a little slow.

1324
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:23,420
So, charge upward toward the sky.

1325
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,120
Drive!

1326
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,120
And that's it.

1327
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,700
Nice, I got a good amount from that.

1328
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:37,700
Sorry.

1329
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,440
Okay, let's go!

1330
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,860
Judgment ruins.

1331
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,360
The lair of judgment.

1332
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:47,500
Judgment.

1333
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,360
Any rorbs or...

1334
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,020
Bless you!

1335
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:57,960
Thank you!

1336
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,880
Anything to be discovered, I feel.

1337
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,340
Is this all just platforming?

1338
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,700
If so, I apologize in advance.

1339
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:12,660
If this is all just a platforming part.

1340
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,580
What is this?

1341
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,880
Flash Gauntlets and Greaves!

1342
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,200
This set boosts Dante's attack and speed, making him a lethal weapon!

1343
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,900
And there we have the full wheel!

1344
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,500
Sorry, I know I'm blocking it, but...

1345
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:47,300
We fight like Virgil, how he fought.

1346
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,880
Oh, okay, that's actually like...

1347
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,440
That's so fun!

1348
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,420
Wait, I want a time thing now.

1349
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,800
Hold on, is there one over here?

1350
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,360
Can we exit the door?

1351
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,940
Oh, you're so silly, game.

1352
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,460
Wait, that's not what I expected.

1353
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:34,680
Hold on.

1354
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:40,960
Do I not go manually up, like up east?

1355
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,720
Wait, then what's up there?

1356
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,020
It pays to go around.

1357
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,760
Bale Wolf.

1358
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,180
That's not what I wanted to do at all.

1359
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,800
Dante, remember the basics of CQC!

1360
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,240
Nicholas, thanks for the ping!

1361
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:16,480
I'm here to kill Chaos.

1362
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,080
The quest is to kill Chaos.

1363
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,340
I can't stand Chaos.

1364
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,780
Chaos pisses me off.

1365
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:22,700
Chaos has a loser nerd with no friends.

1366
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,540
Mom says it's my turn to kill Chaos.

1367
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,620
Chaos hates capitalism and yet he participates in it.

1368
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:28,520
Ironic.

1369
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,280
It has air hike too.

1370
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,160
Beast uppercut.

1371
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:35,860
Let's do it!

1372
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:05,720
Ok,

1373
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:12,350
hold on.

1374
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:23,520
I don't want to fall off.

1375
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,240
Please.

1376
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,600
Please, can I not go up there?

1377
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,620
I feel like there is a secret.

1378
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:43,080
Congrats on beating easily two of the hardest bosses in the whole game.

1379
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:46,200
No way Virgil was supposed to be that hard.

1380
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,900
There is an invisible wall.

1381
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:55,560
The game is...

1382
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,200
Forb...

1383
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:07,070
The game is forbidding me from exploring but that won't stop me from finding the robes!

1384
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:17,990
Like, I'm not saying it wasn't difficult, but...

1385
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:21,250
I just...

1386
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:25,070
You know, I just felt like I played it slow.

1387
01:35:25,170 --> 01:35:26,310
That's why it took me so long.

1388
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:27,430
I got him in three tries!

1389
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:32,630
Oh.

1390
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:35,890
This way.

1391
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:41,490
Sorry, my nose is all gross now.

1392
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:41,770
Hold on.

1393
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:44,910
Because I sneezed.

1394
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,390
Did you hear that come out?

1395
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:54,670
So much ectoplasm.

1396
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:56,870
Ugh.

1397
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:59,330
But,

1398
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:08,610
it's not...

1399
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:10,770
It's not bad looking.

1400
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:12,890
I know that I...

1401
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:15,410
You know how like, when you're sick it's a different color?

1402
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:18,190
That happens to humans too, right?

1403
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:24,490
Nice and minty.

1404
01:36:24,490 --> 01:36:25,450
Okay.

1405
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:35,030
Playing passive is Virgil's weakness.

1406
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,350
Apparently, huh?

1407
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:41,790
Forb.

1408
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,690
Top obsidian path.

1409
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:48,930
We're in Minecraft now?

1410
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,590
Wait, was there nothing else out here?

1411
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:58,960
What's this?

1412
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,000
Oh!

1413
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,640
Oh, we're here!

1414
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:03,860
It's all broken.

1415
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,600
Oh yes, we've been in here!

1416
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,500
Oh my god, wait, oh wow!

1417
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,160
Cool!

1418
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,600
Missed the diamond pickaxe.

1419
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,420
Oh no!

1420
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,400
Okay, cool.

1421
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,140
Is there stuff?

1422
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,260
He knows you're trying to point.

1423
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:34,560
No.

1424
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:37,100
Hey mint chat.

1425
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:37,520
Hello!

1426
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,700
Sorry, I know I keep jumping around.

1427
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:42,880
I'm just looking for stuff.

1428
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,940
I'm a little bit of a loot goblin.

1429
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:48,360
I wanna have Beowulf.

1430
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,380
Actually, sorry, I'm not gonna have Beowulf installed immediately.

1431
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,180
So we can have the double air hike.

1432
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:01,160
Does this lead to that blorb?

1433
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,660
Nope, it doesn't.

1434
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,560
Maybe not.

1435
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,900
What the hell is this?

1436
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:14,300
I don't think... I don't think I should be getting close to this thing.

1437
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,740
Oh, it's this guy!

1438
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:19,460
Oh, ow!

1439
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:19,920
Oh my god.

1440
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:23,520
I have to attack him from behind.

1441
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,400
Shoot.

1442
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,880
Nice.

1443
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,060
Where are you?

1444
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:37,540
There you are.

1445
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:38,840
Come here.

1446
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:44,980
More?

1447
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,240
Oh, more?

1448
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:58,960
Okay, just kidding.

1449
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,240
Come here.

1450
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,520
I need one of you at a time.

1451
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:10,040
Why are you so fast?

1452
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:15,980
Why are you like this?

1453
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,000
Hello?

1454
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,180
I'm just trying to see your behind.

1455
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:21,860
How many are there?

1456
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,860
Oh my god, there's like three of them.

1457
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:34,830
I'm not very good at these guys, sorry.

1458
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,730
Please, please, may I see your bum?

1459
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,750
Please, may I see your bum?

1460
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:44,730
Please, please, I want to see the spiky bum.

1461
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:46,430
Oh, please.

1462
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,710
Please, I need it.

1463
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:51,830
Please, show me.

1464
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:55,570
You, come here.

1465
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:05,530
It's just a little wallflower, that's what he is.

1466
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:09,070
Yeah, little wallflower you.

1467
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:13,150
He's freaking out.

1468
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,250
He's like, I've never been this close.

1469
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,690
They're so shy.

1470
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:30,250
Stop.

1471
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:36,570
Please, please, please, let me see your bum.

1472
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,160
Oh, you know what?

1473
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,700
It was worse, it was worse, it's fine.

1474
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:51,190
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm such a dummy.

1475
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:55,230
There we go, finally, my god.

1476
01:40:57,570 --> 01:41:00,290
These guys are such a pain in my bum.

1477
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,600
They're so annoying.

1478
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,940
So we don't have to do this over again, okay.

1479
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,220
No, they're a pain in their bum.

1480
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,460
Is that your temperance?

1481
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:37,460
Yeah, we're here.

1482
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:46,220
Yeah, I feel like I'm... I don't know where I'm going.

1483
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:46,280
Okay.

1484
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:50,800
Oh, that's just a light, okay.

1485
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:53,980
This is the right way?

1486
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,280
Okay, thank you for confirming, I appreciate it.

1487
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:00,970
Orange?

1488
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:07,290
Oh, I...

1489
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:09,170
Orange?

1490
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:10,570
Gales of flame?

1491
01:42:15,110 --> 01:42:15,830
Oh, okay.

1492
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:16,050
Okay,

1493
01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:21,870
I don't feel like really...

1494
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,220
That doesn't even hit him, that's so lame.

1495
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,200
I can't stand doing those, sorry.

1496
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:41,660
I'd rather have a seize... Oh, that item down there, how do I get that?

1497
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:46,710
Push?

1498
01:42:57,790 --> 01:43:00,170
I didn't really need that, but...

1499
01:43:02,590 --> 01:43:03,910
Minto gaming.

1500
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,020
Tram time.

1501
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,320
I love getting ambushed.

1502
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,880
I love getting ambushed.

1503
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:21,240
I love getting ambushed.

1504
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,320
I love getting ambushed.

1505
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,600
I'm punching you.

1506
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,920
I'm punching you.

1507
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:33,080
Go to hell!

1508
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:47,950
Ouch.

1509
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:04,350
I need to learn what the moveset is for this.

1510
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:07,070
I don't like this one.

1511
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:15,750
Oh, shoot.

1512
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:19,770
Please, leave me alone, I hate you, stupid Reaper.

1513
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:21,890
I fear the Reaper.

1514
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:26,550
Oh my gosh, why can't I parry that?

1515
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:30,230
There we go, nice.

1516
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:40,190
Let's just keep it for now.

1517
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:44,110
We are back here.

1518
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:47,990
How many robes do I got?

1519
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:49,090
Oh, wrong button.

1520
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,540
So close, so close.

1521
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:58,480
I have 19,000.

1522
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,340
More cowbell.

1523
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,720
Time to fight Beowulf again.

1524
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:12,480
I want to use Beowulf more, so I want to...

1525
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:17,640
Actually, before I do that, let's read the file.

1526
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:25,360
Before I forget.

1527
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,560
Alright, combo one.

1528
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,320
X, X, X.

1529
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,600
X, X, pause.

1530
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:42,040
X, X.

1531
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:45,160
I have not done that one yet.

1532
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:46,000
Pause.

1533
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,680
X, X.

1534
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,280
X, X, pause, X.

1535
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:50,620
So we have triple X.

1536
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,680
X, X, pause.

1537
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:54,700
X, X.

1538
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:56,060
Do a fancy kick.

1539
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:56,940
Is that one good?

1540
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,000
Killer bee.

1541
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,380
Jump and X in the air.

1542
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:02,880
Straight.

1543
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:04,920
Yeah.

1544
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,780
What's the go to hell one?

1545
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:08,360
Hyper fist.

1546
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,760
No, I haven't done it.

1547
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:14,640
Repeatedly press X while executing type 2 combo.

1548
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,140
This one?

1549
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,080
Or...

1550
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,660
Was it this one?

1551
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,680
What's the go to hell?

1552
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:29,720
Go to hell.

1553
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:32,140
Go to hell is sword master.

1554
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:44,730
So X, X, pause, X, X and then I just keep mashing X.

1555
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:45,390
I can do that.

1556
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:49,310
My friend is a long time wisp and it's his birthday.

1557
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:53,770
Can I get an MGS happy birthday and a present for when he wakes up?

1558
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,190
Oh, as a present.

1559
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:01,430
Huh?

1560
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:15,450
I don't know what that was.

1561
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:22,950
Weird?

1562
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,450
I don't know.

1563
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,380
Okay.

1564
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:41,540
Ah...

1565
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,440
Okay.

1566
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:45,540
Oh, happy birthday to Yuro.

1567
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:46,040
Yes.

1568
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,360
Happy birthday.

1569
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,380
Congratulations.

1570
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:55,560
Happy birthday with salutations.

1571
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,400
Happy birthday.

1572
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:00,800
May your sky stay blue.

1573
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:05,520
Happy birthday to you.

1574
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:10,260
Happy birthday Yuro and good morning Minto.

1575
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,080
Junto, is that how you say your name?

1576
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:17,160
Your good friend.

1577
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:25,510
X, X...oh, that's the wrong thing.

1578
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:28,850
X, X, pause, X, X.

1579
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:34,190
I don't think I did it.

1580
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:37,410
X, X, pause, X, X.

1581
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:44,070
X, X, pause, X, X.

1582
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:48,550
I'm trying to...I am mashing it all the way.

1583
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:57,250
And Sword Master is Kamehameha.

1584
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:24,430
A long time whispering.

1585
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:25,390
I love your awesome Minto.

1586
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:27,370
I love you, your awesome Minto.

1587
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:28,550
Thank you for the MGS birthday.

1588
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:29,850
Oh, you're here.

1589
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,310
Wait.

1590
01:49:30,870 --> 01:49:32,190
Yuro Juggler, it's you.

1591
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:35,970
Happy birthday.

1592
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:51,280
When you see the fast multi-kicks, you got to mash like three times faster.

1593
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,240
Oh, okay, okay.

1594
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:54,240
Oops, no.

1595
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:57,740
X, X, pause, X, X.

1596
01:49:58,380 --> 01:49:59,780
I don't think I'm mashing fast enough.

1597
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:01,380
X, X, pause.

1598
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,060
Am I doing it correct?

1599
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:12,960
I did it!

1600
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:13,400
I did it!

1601
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:13,760
I did it!

1602
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:14,120
I did it!

1603
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:14,800
I did it!

1604
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,800
Oh man, I had to put the controller down in my lap.

1605
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:27,640
Oh my goodness.

1606
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:30,920
You have to mash it like MGS Torture Sequence, for real.

1607
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:34,580
What is this?

1608
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,360
I don't like...

1609
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,720
What is this?

1610
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,140
What is this?

1611
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:44,260
What is this?

1612
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:47,940
What the hell is that?

1613
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:49,680
Oh!

1614
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,340
It's just like... Okay, it's just like the other things.

1615
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:08,520
Horse.

1616
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,880
Does this place have any rhyme or reason to it?

1617
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:24,140
Like this...

1618
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:24,780
More!

1619
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:55,230
What?

1620
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:07,100
Is it more horsies?

1621
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:08,280
Let me out!

1622
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,760
Oh no, it's these guys.

1623
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:13,000
Okay, okay, hold on.

1624
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,160
I'm just gonna do this, sorry.

1625
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:25,200
I don't feel like dealing with it.

1626
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:26,300
Just die!

1627
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:35,110
I don't feel like dealing with you.

1628
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:36,830
Why are you shooting both directions?

1629
01:52:37,730 --> 01:52:38,810
There is only one thing...

1630
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:40,710
Is it because of me?

1631
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:53,310
Damn horse!

1632
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,870
You damn horse!

1633
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:03,850
Okay, let me out!

1634
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:04,130
No!

1635
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:12,000
More horse!

1636
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:13,560
I tried to jump!

1637
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,240
What was I on?

1638
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:19,000
Oh, I think I was on Gunslinger.

1639
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:27,200
I tried moving.

1640
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,980
These damn things are gonna be the death of me!

1641
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:32,820
No more horse!

1642
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:34,700
No more horse please!

1643
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,260
No more!

1644
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,820
I don't want a horse around anymore!

1645
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:53,660
Okay, so...

1646
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:55,920
What?

1647
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:19,940
At least... Oh my gosh!

1648
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,080
I didn't even know you were...

1649
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,600
Screw you!

1650
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:26,820
Alright, more!

1651
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:36,600
Oh no!

1652
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:39,600
You jerk!

1653
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,280
At least I'm getting lots of warms.

1654
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:53,080
This one doesn't open.

1655
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,780
This one open.

1656
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,560
I'm confusion.

1657
01:55:10,890 --> 01:55:12,050
What is that?

1658
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:13,290
Oh no, it's this guy!

1659
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:14,650
Okay, take care of him first.

1660
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:16,730
Okay, nice.

1661
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:25,360
Ah, shoot!

1662
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:30,180
Ah!

1663
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:31,600
Oh,

1664
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:35,860
I did it.

1665
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:37,700
Nice!

1666
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,540
Everything opened up.

1667
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:44,560
Where did I come from?

1668
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:46,220
Where do I go?

1669
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:47,760
Where did I come from?

1670
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:49,200
What can I do?

1671
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:52,320
This one doesn't have a little circle bottom.

1672
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,780
Warbs in the air?

1673
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:55,480
Can I get them?

1674
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:56,340
I got them.

1675
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:06,280
That's where I came from.

1676
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,880
You!

1677
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:29,480
You from before!

1678
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:36,050
Nice!

1679
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:38,790
Attacking made me avoid that.

1680
01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:39,910
That's so great.

1681
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,010
Oh shoot, shoot, shoot!

1682
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:44,170
Oh my god, I ran right into it.

1683
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:45,090
It's so messed up.

1684
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:57,800
Gosh.

1685
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,660
Oh, he's still here!

1686
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:04,480
You're a healie!

1687
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:08,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1688
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,640
I don't like this area anymore!

1689
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:18,700
What?

1690
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:28,810
All this more warb... I mean...

1691
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:31,490
It's not even a blorb proper.

1692
01:57:31,690 --> 01:57:32,490
It's a fragment.

1693
01:57:36,110 --> 01:57:37,330
Did I make it out?

1694
01:57:38,570 --> 01:57:40,970
Is there anything special to find in here?

1695
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:43,750
Should I go back?

1696
01:57:44,650 --> 01:57:45,650
Or is there anything special?

1697
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:48,670
Two, two, two.

1698
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:52,130
Or is this out?

1699
01:57:54,050 --> 01:57:54,730
Fragment.

1700
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:58,910
What do the blorbs taste like?

1701
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:00,230
Probably blueberry.

1702
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:06,790
I think you got the special things.

1703
01:58:07,690 --> 01:58:07,970
Maybe?

1704
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:11,290
Wait, is this the exit?

1705
01:58:12,370 --> 01:58:13,250
Please say yes.

1706
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:15,110
If anybody knows.

1707
01:58:15,730 --> 01:58:17,430
Where did all the backseaters go?

1708
01:58:17,570 --> 01:58:20,090
Before you were all like, I'm telling you how to play Minto.

1709
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:22,150
Now you won't tell me if I'm out.

1710
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:22,970
Oh yes?

1711
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:23,210
Ok.

1712
01:58:27,010 --> 01:58:27,730
Thank you.

1713
01:58:28,150 --> 01:58:28,790
Bye bye.

1714
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:37,810
I don't think this is helping us get to the top of the tower.

1715
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:38,930
We're just running around.

1716
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:41,750
Are we not?

1717
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,790
What?

1718
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:43,870
How long is this level?

1719
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:49,070
How?

1720
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:49,930
Action.

1721
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:56,660
I think I will...

1722
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:07,920
I can't decide if I want to have it for the poor, but what if I...

1723
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:14,440
What if I...

1724
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:21,380
Aerohike is really good on Beowulf because of the dive kick.

1725
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:26,000
Ok, I'll get it.

1726
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:26,840
Double jump.

1727
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,360
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

1728
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:29,740
That's what I was...

1729
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:31,540
Yes!

1730
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,060
I am broke!

1731
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,180
There's items somewhere.

1732
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:37,940
Collect items!

1733
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,660
I'm getting one guide.

1734
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,420
This is this area.

1735
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:47,960
And then there's a door over here, right?

1736
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:49,900
No?

1737
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:51,900
Just the way I came out.

1738
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,620
Oh no, nevermind.

1739
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:57,300
Oh no!

1740
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:58,780
Oh no!

1741
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:01,480
Oh, is this area...

1742
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:08,240
What do I have on?

1743
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:10,300
I'm going to punch you in the...

1744
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,980
You're going to punch me in the face.

1745
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,420
I don't want to die!

1746
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:14,940
I don't want to die!

1747
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:15,900
Oh my god!

1748
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:26,010
Oh damn!

1749
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:28,830
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1750
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:30,850
Oh mighty game.

1751
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:32,450
What the hell is that?

1752
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:36,390
This cancels them out too.

1753
02:00:37,670 --> 02:00:38,290
Come on!

1754
02:00:39,650 --> 02:00:43,370
Damn, it's really, really powerful.

1755
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:52,880
Do I go in the light or is that the trickster man?

1756
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,000
Little joke guy.

1757
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:57,980
Oh my god!

1758
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:07,040
It's basically Stinger, but...

1759
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,520
Oh my gosh, I should have upgraded it.

1760
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:10,060
It's basically Stinger!

1761
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,780
Oh my god, he cancels them out!

1762
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:12,760
This is so awesome!

1763
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,640
Oh my god!

1764
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,140
It's the trickster man!

1765
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,240
Or is it the way?

1766
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:23,160
I don't know.

1767
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:25,420
The light is...

1768
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:27,700
They always say don't go into the light.

1769
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,280
Are you telling a ghost to go into the light?

1770
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,320
Are you telling me...

1771
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,580
Meet Phantom, a ghost.

1772
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:39,620
Are you saying go into the light, people!

1773
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:44,720
Yes.

1774
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:49,000
Love planet.

1775
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:54,320
This is where we met the sexy lady?

1776
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:56,960
No, what is this place?

1777
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:02,440
We are back at the strip club.

1778
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,700
From the very beginning?

1779
02:02:24,230 --> 02:02:26,150
Who would have thunk?

1780
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:31,110
Who would have thunk?

1781
02:02:33,190 --> 02:02:35,070
That we would be back here.

1782
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:37,090
That's craziness.

1783
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:38,930
Wait, can we go into the other room?

1784
02:02:43,810 --> 02:02:46,370
This room is so sexy.

1785
02:02:47,050 --> 02:02:48,310
It was over here, right?

1786
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:48,670
The door?

1787
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:50,070
Yeah.

1788
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:51,930
Bullseye.

1789
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:02,900
Sweet dreams.

1790
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:04,660
What did I just reset?

1791
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:07,060
Is there a puzzle in here?

1792
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:09,560
What did I just do?

1793
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:15,740
I remember destroying this room many times.

1794
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:22,820
I did for that secret mission.

1795
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:24,160
I remember.

1796
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,340
It's wide.

1797
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:29,500
Yeah baby!

1798
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:34,540
Freaking Rorb Central.

1799
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,220
The good old days.

1800
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,900
What part was that?

1801
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:42,380
Back when little Mijo...

1802
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:45,640
There we go.

1803
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:47,740
I think I got everything we can get in here.

1804
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,540
Oh wait, destroy the chair.

1805
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,480
Nice.

1806
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:55,140
Destroy the jukebox.

1807
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:56,980
Big money.

1808
02:04:02,590 --> 02:04:04,670
Sorry I'm backtracking a little bit.

1809
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:06,230
Nevermind.

1810
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:11,350
Let's go towards the tower.

1811
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:16,110
What does this do?

1812
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:26,580
I remember skipping that area before too.

1813
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:32,340
The game lets you wander off the beaten path and won't tell you you're going the wrong next few missions.

1814
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:32,780
Be careful.

1815
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:34,020
Thank you!

1816
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:35,520
Actually I really appreciate that.

1817
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:44,420
It's not that I'm tired of the game obviously, but I'm on part 5 of this game.

1818
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:48,720
I'm ready to go to the next game.

1819
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,920
It seems a lot of people really like...

1820
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:56,340
Devil May Cry 5?

1821
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:11,380
What was it trying to do?

1822
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:17,260
This bike is like, I'm trying to climb up here by myself.

1823
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:21,140
Yeah!

1824
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:25,360
I love wooing Dante!

1825
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:31,160
Oh no.

1826
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:34,500
Not a woo moment.

1827
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:37,160
I think I might add that to the dono sound.

1828
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:50,300
You got this Dante!

1829
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:57,760
I wish I could one shot them like this.

1830
02:06:06,230 --> 02:06:07,430
God

1831
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:15,680
he's so cool.

1832
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:23,430
Good job Dante.

1833
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:27,830
Our bike!

1834
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:29,270
Whatever.

1835
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:39,540
Nice!

1836
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,020
That was quite the long mission.

1837
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:51,120
I mean I know I got distracted a little bit, but there was a lot going on in that mission.

1838
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:54,520
Nice!

1839
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,020
The motorcycle was supposed to be another weapon, but it was too complicated to implement into the game.

1840
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:00,140
Would've been so cool.

1841
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,260
It would've!

1842
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:05,280
My opinion on DMC5 would get me crucified.

1843
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,280
Especially considering my love for DMC Devil May Cry.

1844
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,860
Now that's a...

1845
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:13,800
That's a spicy opinion.

1846
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,340
Wait, what?

1847
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:18,660
We're on...

1848
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:20,160
14?

1849
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:21,800
Or 13?

1850
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:24,580
Which chapter are we on?

1851
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:30,000
15.

1852
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:35,690
Don't spoil DMC5.

1853
02:07:36,230 --> 02:07:37,750
I'm not seeing any spoilers.

1854
02:07:38,370 --> 02:07:41,170
Rather, I have not read them if they are there, but don't spoil!

1855
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:43,530
Oh, I missed the 15.

1856
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:44,170
Dang it.

1857
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:51,210
Every time I see him throw the handles of the bike as a kid I expected the handlebars to explode like in Spongebob.

1858
02:07:54,030 --> 02:07:55,190
I can see it.

1859
02:07:56,230 --> 02:07:57,390
I missed the 15.

1860
02:07:58,410 --> 02:08:00,030
It was in the branches.

1861
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:04,330
I see, I see, I see.

1862
02:08:06,910 --> 02:08:09,070
Okay, I'm gonna get some more water.

1863
02:08:09,470 --> 02:08:10,750
I need some more water real quick.

1864
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:12,130
15.

1865
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:13,990
How many are in this game?

1866
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:14,790
How many chapters?

1867
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:18,370
We're definitely not gonna finish it today, but I'm just wondering.

1868
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:22,410
20.

1869
02:08:24,710 --> 02:08:25,950
So just 5 more.

1870
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:28,630
6 more.

1871
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:29,950
6 more.

1872
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:41,170
20 missions, but 2 are boss battles alone.

1873
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:42,590
Got it, got it, got it.

1874
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:43,030
Thank you.

1875
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,910
Okay.

1876
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:47,950
The last 3 are hard.

1877
02:08:48,070 --> 02:08:48,530
That's okay.

1878
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:53,170
I figured today... I'm still gonna play mission 15.

1879
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:57,110
I figured today might be a little shorter and then...

1880
02:08:57,110 --> 02:09:00,790
Next week I'm going to be...

1881
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:04,590
Basically every game that I am up in the air with.

1882
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:09,110
Like this game and Indiana Jones and...

1883
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:12,830
Actually that might be it, but I'm gonna endurance until I beat them.

1884
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:13,810
Yeah, yeah.

1885
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:17,610
I wasn't able to catch you on my V-Day, but it was earlier this week.

1886
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:19,650
Thanks for another awesome year.

1887
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:22,550
Oh, I'm sorry, I missed a zip spot.

1888
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:24,490
Okay, I'll sing a happy birthday and then I'll go get some water.

1889
02:09:25,490 --> 02:09:29,170
Happy birthday to you.

1890
02:09:29,910 --> 02:09:32,510
Happy birthday to you.

1891
02:09:32,830 --> 02:09:36,110
Happy birthday, dear 6th spawn.

1892
02:09:37,250 --> 02:09:40,870
Happy birthday to you.

1893
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:43,790
Happy birthday!

1894
02:09:47,410 --> 02:09:49,490
Yeah, I figure with the...

1895
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:53,110
With the days off that I have...

1896
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:55,950
That I've been taking this week, my voice should be...

1897
02:09:55,950 --> 02:09:57,190
And I sound mostly okay.

1898
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:58,630
I still sound a little bit...

1899
02:09:58,630 --> 02:10:00,070
A little bit rough.

1900
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:03,490
But I think my voice should mostly be okay next week.

1901
02:10:03,830 --> 02:10:07,610
And if I keep taking the medicine, which I will take when I get back...

1902
02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:11,330
When I get the water, I should be okay.

1903
02:10:11,910 --> 02:10:12,790
I think too.

1904
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:16,250
Endurance a little bit next week.

1905
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:16,910
Not tomorrow.

1906
02:10:17,090 --> 02:10:18,030
I don't know why I was gonna say that.

1907
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:19,290
Yeah.

1908
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:21,050
Okay.

1909
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:23,190
We are back.

1910
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:26,230
I get water and I also go to the ghost's room.

1911
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:30,230
So, you can take a little break too.

1912
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:33,350
But don't go far.

1913
02:10:34,350 --> 02:10:34,850
No!

1914
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:36,250
Oh no!

1915
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:38,770
Wait, why isn't it the font that I use?

1916
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:44,380
Wait, no, it changed my font.

1917
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:45,860
There it is.

1918
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,180
Okay.

1919
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:51,560
Okay.

1920
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:52,740
Okay.

1921
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:54,060
Okay.

1922
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:55,880
Where are we?

1923
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:45,940
Okay.

1924
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:47,720
Okay.

1925
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:55,350
Welcome back.

1926
02:13:55,410 --> 02:13:56,150
Thank you.

1927
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:57,970
Sorry about the break.

1928
02:13:58,610 --> 02:14:01,070
Sorry about the break.

1929
02:14:01,670 --> 02:14:02,310
Alright.

1930
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:02,730
Alright.

1931
02:14:03,430 --> 02:14:06,310
My tea might be...

1932
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:11,590
A little hot.

1933
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:12,630
Missions.

1934
02:14:14,270 --> 02:14:14,950
Customize?

1935
02:14:15,110 --> 02:14:15,910
How much do I have?

1936
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:17,230
Sorry, I know I always check.

1937
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:18,930
Okay, not a lot.

1938
02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:20,950
That's fine.

1939
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:22,170
Mission start.

1940
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:30,180
What's going on?

1941
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:33,520
Heaven?

1942
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:37,400
An angel?

1943
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:43,220
What's this?

1944
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:49,540
Hole?

1945
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:49,600
Hole?

1946
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:02,280
Worst enemy in the game?

1947
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:03,120
Oh my god!

1948
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:05,840
Holy shit, I thought I was going to fall off.

1949
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:24,750
What the hell?

1950
02:15:24,850 --> 02:15:25,710
Why is it getting bigger?

1951
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:51,300
Hello?

1952
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:55,020
What is happening?

1953
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:01,220
What is happening?

1954
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,740
I don't like these guys.

1955
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:06,100
Dante!

1956
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:07,780
Oh my god.

1957
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:11,740
Dante says screw it all.

1958
02:16:15,980 --> 02:16:18,960
Oh, I forgot that I'm not in Sword Master.

1959
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:19,360
There we go.

1960
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:28,370
Oh my god.

1961
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:29,870
Dante, don't miss.

1962
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:31,370
Don't die at the wall.

1963
02:16:36,050 --> 02:16:37,770
I was waiting for the angel.

1964
02:16:50,610 --> 02:16:51,710
What the hell?

1965
02:16:52,530 --> 02:16:53,410
Sorry, hold on.

1966
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:54,950
What is going on with my computer?

1967
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:58,550
Why did I clip out?

1968
02:16:59,350 --> 02:17:01,150
What the heck is going on?

1969
02:17:03,740 --> 02:17:05,150
What happened?

1970
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,140
My computer is lagging like crazy.

1971
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:15,280
What is happening?

1972
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,560
I lost chat.

1973
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:23,960
What's happening?

1974
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:28,220
My computer is lagging like crazy.

1975
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:31,220
Am I okay?

1976
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:35,540
What is going on?

1977
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:37,240
Why?

1978
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:41,100
I can't see you guys anymore.

1979
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:43,060
I can see you through OBS, but that's it.

1980
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:53,160
I always have to have computer issues.

1981
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:53,740
Why me?

1982
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:56,760
Why me?

1983
02:17:57,980 --> 02:18:01,000
Everything I try to do never fixes it.

1984
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:11,100
I can't bring you guys back because you're off screen.

1985
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:14,900
Basically, my left monitor is the Switch.

1986
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:17,460
My right monitor is where I was reading chat.

1987
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:21,640
And I don't know where you guys went.

1988
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:36,020
Sorry.

1989
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:42,420
Let me just fight these guys and hopefully my computer doesn't bug up anymore.

1990
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:43,960
I'll look into it afterwards.

1991
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:57,540
Is it dead?

1992
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:08,020
Why can't he aim?

1993
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:09,720
Why can't you aim Dante?

1994
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:09,940
Hey!

1995
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:22,400
Horse!

1996
02:19:44,350 --> 02:19:46,650
Everything is breaking you guys.

1997
02:19:46,930 --> 02:19:48,450
Sorry, I'm so frustrated.

1998
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:52,930
Tech issues are so the worst annoyingness ever.

1999
02:19:53,470 --> 02:19:54,810
Oh my god, not you bitches.

2000
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:11,760
Fire!

2001
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:15,640
Oh my god.

2002
02:20:24,930 --> 02:20:25,830
I don't want to do

2003
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:33,420
damage from the freaking angel things.

2004
02:20:41,380 --> 02:20:42,180
I jumped!

2005
02:20:45,090 --> 02:20:46,970
I don't know how to get out of that, honestly.

2006
02:20:48,590 --> 02:20:49,770
I'm just gonna fight.

2007
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:50,490
I'm just gonna fight.

2008
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:51,390
I'm just gonna fight.

2009
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:52,710
I'm just gonna fight.

2010
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:54,770
I'm just gonna...

2011
02:20:55,770 --> 02:20:56,930
I don't care.

2012
02:20:57,030 --> 02:20:58,430
I'm so mad right now.

2013
02:20:58,510 --> 02:20:59,030
I'm sorry.

2014
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:05,120
Stupid!

2015
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:14,430
Which way?

2016
02:22:14,530 --> 02:22:15,550
I came in through there.

2017
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:18,710
Is this anything?

2018
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:20,210
No?

2019
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:21,610
Just lighting up?

2020
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,510
Don't give up Mito!

2021
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:29,870
Remember, you are the strongest ghost!

2022
02:22:30,550 --> 02:22:31,190
Thank you!

2023
02:22:36,710 --> 02:22:38,050
What is this?

2024
02:22:39,050 --> 02:22:41,570
Looks like an elevator control switch, but something is missing.

2025
02:22:42,130 --> 02:22:44,390
There are three indentations to insert objects into.

2026
02:22:44,570 --> 02:22:44,910
Three?

2027
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:50,380
This way I guess first.

2028
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:52,880
Is this the only way I can go?

2029
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:56,380
Forbidden land.

2030
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,020
Hell yeah.

2031
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:11,360
Give me all them robs!

2032
02:23:14,970 --> 02:23:17,070
Let the hate flow through you.

2033
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:21,410
What the?

2034
02:23:21,730 --> 02:23:22,410
Welcome?

2035
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:23,570
I don't remember that.

2036
02:23:24,690 --> 02:23:25,430
Is that always there?

2037
02:23:33,220 --> 02:23:34,080
Oh no!

2038
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:36,300
An energy source has been activated.

2039
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:39,940
That's the thing we were inside, right?

2040
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:43,980
It's when you came out of Leviathan.

2041
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:48,960
A large snapping sound, like two parts locking together can be heard from beyond the wall.

2042
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,480
That's sick!

2043
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:57,860
Secret robes, eh?

2044
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:03,340
I know how to find them, don't I?

2045
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:11,620
Up we go.

2046
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:18,400
I'm guessing this allowed us to go a different direction?

2047
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:21,280
No.

2048
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:27,020
Like two things snapping together.

2049
02:24:33,890 --> 02:24:35,970
I am good at finding these robes, eh?

2050
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:46,120
I knew this was a thing!

2051
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:56,660
Massive force is shaking the tower.

2052
02:24:58,080 --> 02:24:59,280
No more horse.

2053
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:05,220
It feels like the whole tower is rotating.

2054
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:10,360
So if I go back in here...

2055
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:15,980
Is this different at all or is it still the same?

2056
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:18,340
Still the same.

2057
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:23,360
So the door just changes and we go to a different space.

2058
02:25:28,770 --> 02:25:31,150
I figured that was the case, I just wanted to confirm.

2059
02:25:41,030 --> 02:25:41,230
No!

2060
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:06,880
Different place!

2061
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:10,980
Wait, don't rotate?

2062
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:15,640
Just kidding.

2063
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:22,120
No breakdown.

2064
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:24,340
I mean, yes, I am having a breakdown.

2065
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,280
Ahaha!

2066
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:36,980
Come on,

2067
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:42,680
bird!

2068
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:52,140
This is where I switched it to, right?

2069
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:53,940
Oh my god.

2070
02:26:57,260 --> 02:26:58,500
Go up?

2071
02:26:58,660 --> 02:26:59,560
Where was the door?

2072
02:27:05,930 --> 02:27:06,710
Oh gosh.

2073
02:27:07,490 --> 02:27:08,770
Over here.

2074
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:18,500
Alright.

2075
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:21,860
Your bum!

2076
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:25,240
Show it to me!

2077
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:29,940
Show it to me!

2078
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:33,760
Come on!

2079
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:34,640
Come on!

2080
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:35,960
I had it.

2081
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:37,200
There we go.

2082
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,220
Some metal gears.

2083
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:42,300
Come here.

2084
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:44,100
Nice, nice.

2085
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:44,560
Come here.

2086
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:45,700
Nice, nice.

2087
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:48,840
Nice.

2088
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:50,600
Alright.

2089
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:55,040
Run.

2090
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,180
Oh, come here.

2091
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:00,120
Come here.

2092
02:28:01,240 --> 02:28:02,540
Come here, come here.

2093
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:04,900
Don't push, don't push now.

2094
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:07,500
Nice.

2095
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:08,520
Come here.

2096
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,360
Come here.

2097
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:11,620
He's getting shoved around.

2098
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:13,480
Come here.

2099
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:18,060
Okay, we got him.

2100
02:28:22,960 --> 02:28:23,860
Like that.

2101
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:25,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh gosh.

2102
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:26,420
Oh gosh.

2103
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:26,660
Okay.

2104
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:30,960
Oh gosh!

2105
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:31,320
Okay.

2106
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:41,980
Okay.

2107
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:44,120
Nice.

2108
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:49,300
Why is this one so slow?

2109
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:51,340
Okay.

2110
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:53,300
Nice.

2111
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:59,230
The first thing!

2112
02:28:59,670 --> 02:29:01,910
The Orihalcon fragment.

2113
02:29:02,370 --> 02:29:03,590
Oh, it got broken.

2114
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:04,970
It's just like Inuyasha.

2115
02:29:13,810 --> 02:29:15,810
You guys were in sync before.

2116
02:29:15,950 --> 02:29:16,450
What happened?

2117
02:29:18,890 --> 02:29:19,190
Okay.

2118
02:29:20,970 --> 02:29:21,690
Nice.

2119
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:26,370
Are you kidding me?

2120
02:29:28,390 --> 02:29:28,670
Okay.

2121
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:34,010
Cool.

2122
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:45,840
Missed blorb?

2123
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:46,920
No.

2124
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,300
I will not miss a blorb.

2125
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:00,660
Okay, I will become the world's greatest wall climber.

2126
02:30:01,180 --> 02:30:02,100
Wall hacks please.

2127
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:12,280
Okay.

2128
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:14,040
Nice.

2129
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:17,660
Come on.

2130
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:18,120
There we go.

2131
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:22,100
Yippee!

2132
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:25,600
I think that's two out of four now.

2133
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:30,180
Okay, now we go back and we spin.

2134
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:31,960
Oh, ouch!

2135
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:33,580
Are you kidding me?

2136
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:37,500
Why is everything in this freaking place out to murder?

2137
02:30:38,260 --> 02:30:41,560
Okay, can you leave me alone for like a minute?

2138
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:44,620
Okay.

2139
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:48,230
Alright, next door!

2140
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:50,050
I imagine, right?

2141
02:30:54,230 --> 02:30:57,690
I imagine we go this way again, right?

2142
02:30:58,310 --> 02:30:58,930
I imagine.

2143
02:30:59,330 --> 02:30:59,690
Ouch!

2144
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:02,010
Oh my god, it is so much damage.

2145
02:31:09,610 --> 02:31:10,210
No.

2146
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:11,750
Oh, wait.

2147
02:31:11,950 --> 02:31:12,310
No.

2148
02:31:14,130 --> 02:31:14,650
Wait.

2149
02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,690
Is it the other door?

2150
02:31:23,450 --> 02:31:24,350
Other door.

2151
02:31:25,810 --> 02:31:26,930
Door with a circle.

2152
02:31:27,130 --> 02:31:27,230
Okay.

2153
02:31:30,050 --> 02:31:30,650
Understood.

2154
02:31:35,210 --> 02:31:37,930
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone.

2155
02:31:38,390 --> 02:31:38,990
Ouch!

2156
02:31:39,690 --> 02:31:40,990
Leave me alone.

2157
02:31:41,890 --> 02:31:43,570
Please, I ask for nothing.

2158
02:31:43,690 --> 02:31:44,510
I am simple.

2159
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:47,890
I just need to be left alone.

2160
02:31:48,310 --> 02:31:49,870
Please, birth my own thoughts.

2161
02:31:49,990 --> 02:31:50,190
Please.

2162
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:56,530
Okay, we are... Oh, music is still happening.

2163
02:31:57,430 --> 02:31:57,910
What's here?

2164
02:31:58,690 --> 02:31:59,630
Oh, what?

2165
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,040
Does this work?

2166
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:11,500
Damn.

2167
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:15,160
Oh, it's the guys that turn around.

2168
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:16,260
They go up and...

2169
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:17,980
They go back and forth.

2170
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:21,980
Okay, you come over.

2171
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:27,360
How do you do that?

2172
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:41,710
It's sword master.

2173
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:48,520
It's okay.

2174
02:32:48,620 --> 02:32:50,020
We have a lot of space in here.

2175
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:54,820
I could... I'll just wait for him to come back.

2176
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:57,160
There is the other one.

2177
02:32:58,700 --> 02:32:59,100
Again.

2178
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:01,480
Can you ignore them?

2179
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:02,720
You know, you probably can.

2180
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:06,460
But they are so... Okay.

2181
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:08,680
Nevermind.

2182
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:26,840
At least I got some health from it.

2183
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:30,120
What's this?

2184
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:31,960
Oh, this is the thing I need.

2185
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:33,380
Okay, wait.

2186
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:34,000
I'm confused.

2187
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:37,920
So do I spin this and it rotates the clock room?

2188
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:40,120
And then I go back to the clock room?

2189
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:42,400
And then I...

2190
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:50,160
Then I go rotate in the clock room?

2191
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:51,500
Then I come back here?

2192
02:33:52,300 --> 02:33:53,720
And then... Oh my god.

2193
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:09,500
So when we rotate we just...

2194
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:11,600
Wait, so do I even go through here?

2195
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:14,320
Where am I?

2196
02:34:19,740 --> 02:34:21,180
I go in here.

2197
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:22,400
Yes.

2198
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:22,760
Okay.

2199
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:52,240
Little babies?

2200
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:54,300
Oh my god, more.

2201
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:57,900
My favorite one!

2202
02:34:59,060 --> 02:35:00,880
Oh my gosh, please.

2203
02:35:12,890 --> 02:35:14,470
Give me my robes, thank you.

2204
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:29,780
Nice.

2205
02:35:32,180 --> 02:35:34,320
And she is gonna explode the babies.

2206
02:35:35,540 --> 02:35:35,760
No?

2207
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:36,500
No babies?

2208
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,240
Nobody is for granted?

2209
02:35:41,300 --> 02:35:44,420
That's always my biggest fear if I ever...

2210
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:46,140
If I ever kill a spider.

2211
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:48,440
I'm always so scared of the babies.

2212
02:35:49,220 --> 02:35:51,220
The potential babies coming out.

2213
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:52,900
No babies.

2214
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:01,540
Oh there it is.

2215
02:36:02,780 --> 02:36:04,160
I got another fragment.

2216
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:06,920
Okay.

2217
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:12,740
It was there the whole time.

2218
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:18,600
Don't be extra, Dante.

2219
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:24,240
Don't be... I wish I could see...

2220
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:28,240
I wish I could see...

2221
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:32,660
I wish... I don't know if the guy respawned or not.

2222
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:35,900
Yeah, I already turned this circle.

2223
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:38,840
My

2224
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:49,180
god!

2225
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:52,700
He was right there.

2226
02:37:01,230 --> 02:37:02,370
Okay, bye.

2227
02:37:07,630 --> 02:37:08,510
See ya.

2228
02:37:16,050 --> 02:37:17,470
Twelve thousand.

2229
02:37:18,910 --> 02:37:20,690
We can learn drive.

2230
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:22,370
No, that's a lie.

2231
02:37:22,490 --> 02:37:22,690
Sorry.

2232
02:37:26,490 --> 02:37:27,710
Straight level two.

2233
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:29,050
Might be good, right?

2234
02:37:30,990 --> 02:37:33,270
Since it's basically stinger but with my fists.

2235
02:37:38,990 --> 02:37:40,730
Sorry, I was thinking of the uppercut.

2236
02:37:42,190 --> 02:37:44,290
But I need to learn how to do...

2237
02:37:44,910 --> 02:37:47,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2238
02:37:47,590 --> 02:37:50,290
I need to learn how to do...

2239
02:37:56,260 --> 02:37:57,300
The kick.

2240
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:01,160
We know straight.

2241
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:02,280
Air hike.

2242
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:06,160
Just be in mid-air, yeah.

2243
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:08,420
But isn't there a dive kick?

2244
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:10,220
What is that one?

2245
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:12,560
This one.

2246
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:14,300
Press X in mid-air.

2247
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:16,120
Am I not doing it right?

2248
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:17,300
Wait.

2249
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:25,460
Oh X!

2250
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:27,900
I was pressing A.

2251
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:39,860
I see.

2252
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,540
Your poor PlayStation brain.

2253
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:44,700
I know.

2254
02:38:46,060 --> 02:38:47,900
PlayStation brain real.

2255
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:51,800
What the...

2256
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:53,260
Oh that's my shadow.

2257
02:38:53,260 --> 02:38:56,780
I thought something was crawling up the wall.

2258
02:38:57,700 --> 02:38:59,800
How was my shadow doing that?

2259
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:01,680
Crazy.

2260
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:06,780
Okay, so I'm guessing I...

2261
02:39:10,260 --> 02:39:11,460
Hold on.

2262
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:18,960
I see him over there.

2263
02:39:20,380 --> 02:39:21,060
I...

2264
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:24,060
Look how many there are.

2265
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:27,320
I...

2266
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:34,440
I'm so confused about this part.

2267
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:39,260
I already spun it, but the spin led me here.

2268
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:40,580
And then do I...

2269
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:46,440
Please.

2270
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:47,500
Please.

2271
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:56,920
Go through the blue doors.

2272
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:57,720
No spin.

2273
02:39:57,960 --> 02:39:58,560
No spin.

2274
02:39:58,700 --> 02:39:58,800
Okay.

2275
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:01,880
Thank you for helping me guys.

2276
02:40:02,300 --> 02:40:04,240
This part is confusing me a little bit.

2277
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:08,180
Lots and lots of roars.

2278
02:40:08,280 --> 02:40:09,020
Very delicious.

2279
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:13,160
Can I jump in here?

2280
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:13,540
Nope.

2281
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:15,260
There we go.

2282
02:40:17,740 --> 02:40:18,340
Okay.

2283
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:25,480
What is here?

2284
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:27,280
What is this?

2285
02:40:30,380 --> 02:40:33,320
Oh these guys that move when I don't look at them, right?

2286
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:35,640
Oh my god.

2287
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:47,480
I'm gonna use this one on them.

2288
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:52,720
Okay.

2289
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:53,760
I don't look.

2290
02:40:53,860 --> 02:40:54,200
I don't look.

2291
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:58,660
I don't look.

2292
02:40:58,740 --> 02:40:59,120
I don't look.

2293
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:01,940
I'm not looking.

2294
02:41:02,020 --> 02:41:02,380
I'm not looking.

2295
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:04,140
I'm not looking.

2296
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:04,680
I'm not looking.

2297
02:41:07,820 --> 02:41:08,260
I'm not looking.

2298
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:10,380
I'm not looking.

2299
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:12,200
Where'd you go?

2300
02:41:20,860 --> 02:41:21,680
Oh my god.

2301
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,100
I'm not looking.

2302
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:25,640
I'm not looking.

2303
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:30,040
What's happening to me?

2304
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:32,300
It's eating my devil trigger!

2305
02:41:39,140 --> 02:41:40,920
Get me out of here.

2306
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:44,140
I'm so dead.

2307
02:41:44,540 --> 02:41:45,140
Rip Bozo!

2308
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:46,300
El Bozo!

2309
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:47,300
El Bozo!

2310
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:47,860
El Bozo!

2311
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:48,060
El Bozo!

2312
02:42:03,390 --> 02:42:04,350
Oh, I'm back here.

2313
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:07,010
Okay, thank you for being so generous to me, game.

2314
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:08,770
What am I using?

2315
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:13,630
I don't remember how to beat these guys.

2316
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:21,560
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2317
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:25,180
Oh, I killed one!

2318
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:25,660
I killed one!

2319
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:32,340
Yippee!

2320
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:35,580
Okay.

2321
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:38,060
Okay.

2322
02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:40,220
I just have to get through here.

2323
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:51,540
Now for the hard part.

2324
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:52,040
Exactly.

2325
02:42:52,040 --> 02:42:52,200
Exactly.

2326
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:12,410
Can I jump?

2327
02:43:12,590 --> 02:43:13,730
Can I trickster in the air?

2328
02:43:14,090 --> 02:43:14,810
No, I can't.

2329
02:43:14,870 --> 02:43:15,030
Okay.

2330
02:43:16,470 --> 02:43:18,270
Okay, we made it through one!

2331
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:27,600
Okay, we made it through two!

2332
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:32,080
Okay, we did it!

2333
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:43,260
We made it!

2334
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:45,000
What's in here?

2335
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:48,480
What's in here?

2336
02:43:53,060 --> 02:43:53,880
Nothing?

2337
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:54,980
Really?

2338
02:43:55,220 --> 02:43:55,540
Okay.

2339
02:43:57,340 --> 02:43:57,720
Okay!

2340
02:43:58,220 --> 02:43:59,680
Now we go back!

2341
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:15,460
Try using Beowulf attack.

2342
02:44:15,740 --> 02:44:17,920
Wait, Beowulf attack on air to make it.

2343
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:23,640
Like...

2344
02:44:36,390 --> 02:44:38,130
Let's go!

2345
02:44:40,370 --> 02:44:42,290
We did it!

2346
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:46,830
Alrighty.

2347
02:44:46,830 --> 02:44:47,410
Now...

2348
02:44:47,990 --> 02:44:50,370
I punch back...

2349
02:44:56,440 --> 02:44:58,740
It was this one, right?

2350
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:03,460
This one?

2351
02:45:04,460 --> 02:45:04,900
No, no.

2352
02:45:05,060 --> 02:45:05,740
Stop it, Dante.

2353
02:45:14,610 --> 02:45:15,770
Whose blood is that?

2354
02:45:16,490 --> 02:45:17,090
One more.

2355
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:18,870
Wait, where am I?

2356
02:45:27,790 --> 02:45:28,870
Is this the eleventh?

2357
02:45:29,550 --> 02:45:33,310
Wait, if I go through here...

2358
02:45:33,310 --> 02:45:35,510
Devil Sprout lift.

2359
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:42,460
What's here?

2360
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,440
I'm getting lost.

2361
02:45:52,820 --> 02:45:54,340
No, no, no.

2362
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:59,840
Okay, no more exploration.

2363
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:02,960
I'm done exploring.

2364
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:06,960
It's play to win.

2365
02:46:07,060 --> 02:46:07,920
Spin to win, everybody.

2366
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:10,720
Spin to win.

2367
02:46:21,470 --> 02:46:24,210
The whole tower is shaking.

2368
02:46:25,150 --> 02:46:28,370
So this should lead us back to the staircase then.

2369
02:46:30,370 --> 02:46:32,270
So we can put in the amulet.

2370
02:46:35,710 --> 02:46:36,390
Wait...

2371
02:46:36,390 --> 02:46:36,490
What?

2372
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:40,270
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2373
02:46:40,450 --> 02:46:43,890
Oh shit.

2374
02:47:06,330 --> 02:47:07,310
How did you get me?

2375
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:16,720
Jump and kick.

2376
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:18,060
Jump and kick.

2377
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:23,160
I can't.

2378
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:23,780
Okay, okay, okay.

2379
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:24,500
Now I can.

2380
02:47:31,300 --> 02:47:32,980
I don't want to die to spiders again.

2381
02:47:34,540 --> 02:47:35,400
Nice suit.

2382
02:47:36,140 --> 02:47:38,980
I know you're about charged enough, but...

2383
02:47:41,060 --> 02:47:43,120
Are we gonna...Oh, there's more.

2384
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:44,560
Oh my god, there's more.

2385
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:46,260
Oh my god, there's more.

2386
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:48,360
Of course there's more.

2387
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:49,880
Of course there's more.

2388
02:47:54,220 --> 02:47:55,260
There's so many more.

2389
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:08,070
TT, please.

2390
02:48:08,090 --> 02:48:08,750
Please let me TT.

2391
02:48:09,330 --> 02:48:10,170
Please let me TT.

2392
02:48:12,790 --> 02:48:15,170
Oh my god, please attack anything.

2393
02:48:17,450 --> 02:48:18,490
Wasted moment.

2394
02:48:18,950 --> 02:48:19,630
Wasted moment.

2395
02:48:54,220 --> 02:48:55,240
Any babies?

2396
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:02,920
Am I backtracking?

2397
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:03,800
Is that what I'm doing?

2398
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:05,180
No way.

2399
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:07,080
Am I backtracking?

2400
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:09,960
Am I having to spin these all the way to backtrack?

2401
02:49:20,380 --> 02:49:21,620
I can just go through the door?

2402
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:22,220
Really?

2403
02:49:26,660 --> 02:49:27,820
Wait, which door?

2404
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:31,120
Wait, this is where I came from.

2405
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:35,960
More back.

2406
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:40,020
Where is the other door?

2407
02:49:40,720 --> 02:49:41,440
This door.

2408
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:45,520
Thank you guys.

2409
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:46,360
Okay.

2410
02:49:48,140 --> 02:49:50,240
This area is confusing as hell.

2411
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:53,320
Three indentations.

2412
02:49:53,740 --> 02:49:56,680
I use the fragment and I use the fragment and I use the fragment!

2413
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:00,880
Now we have an elevator.

2414
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:02,260
Easy.

2415
02:50:11,500 --> 02:50:13,060
You can take the red door.

2416
02:50:13,340 --> 02:50:14,820
Or you can take the blue door.

2417
02:50:14,900 --> 02:50:15,220
Nevermind.

2418
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:17,460
You can take the cutscene.

2419
02:50:19,620 --> 02:50:21,760
Oh, the dragons are lowering.

2420
02:50:22,220 --> 02:50:22,960
What's going on?

2421
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:23,840
I'm scared.

2422
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:31,960
He plucks the threads that make us dance finger and toe.

2423
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:38,620
We surrender in joy to the lowest of the foul and rank.

2424
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:43,800
We submerge through darkness, rancid filth.

2425
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:50,220
Hour by hour, we move downward, ever closer to heaven.

2426
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:51,420
I don't think you're going down.

2427
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:54,140
You've been going up this whole time!

2428
02:50:54,140 --> 02:50:59,380
Now, let the world resonate.

2429
02:51:00,020 --> 02:51:01,420
Sloth.

2430
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:03,820
Gluttony.

2431
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:07,440
He pronounces every syllable.

2432
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:08,640
Lust.

2433
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:11,460
Wrath.

2434
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:13,240
Pride.

2435
02:51:14,220 --> 02:51:18,220
The bell of chaos that tolls human desires.

2436
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:27,960
After two thousand long years, the once sealed gate to the mnemonic world will open.

2437
02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:29,100
Yes!

2438
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:30,140
Destruction!

2439
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:34,820
Carnage and despair!

2440
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:39,000
Let your instincts drive you.

2441
02:51:40,700 --> 02:51:49,680
Interrupt this world in fear, as it's bell of name, Teben Negru, strikes the heart of mankind.

2442
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:52,280
Not these things.

2443
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:53,400
They are the worst.

2444
02:51:53,900 --> 02:51:56,200
Please, don't make me fight them.

2445
02:51:58,860 --> 02:52:01,480
Who's been using their sword against these fuckers?

2446
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:03,980
It was me.

2447
02:52:04,960 --> 02:52:07,980
Sparda, once imprisoned...

2448
02:52:08,540 --> 02:52:11,380
There'll be...

2449
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:22,500
Guys, I think we were too late.

2450
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:34,320
Nicer!

2451
02:52:42,380 --> 02:52:46,820
Well, with that, we have cleared mission 15.

2452
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,660
We got 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 left.

2453
02:52:51,260 --> 02:52:52,520
Five more missions.

2454
02:52:53,400 --> 02:52:55,600
I only got through three missions today.

2455
02:52:56,300 --> 02:52:57,160
I'm sorry, guys.

2456
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:01,900
But my computer is acting up.

2457
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:04,100
My camera is acting up.

2458
02:53:06,380 --> 02:53:15,620
Every time I just want to update to make things look better and act better for you guys, everything always acts up.

2459
02:53:16,820 --> 02:53:19,080
I'm going bonkers from it.

2460
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:22,360
I get a new phone for my camera, it acts up.

2461
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:25,660
I get a new whole ass computer, it acts up.

2462
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:34,060
Like, to give you an idea, my camera for some reason...

2463
02:53:34,060 --> 02:53:36,640
It starts auto-looking.

2464
02:53:36,780 --> 02:53:40,400
Even if I'm looking straight, it starts making me look like I'm looking to the right.

2465
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:44,220
And I'm like, I don't know why, and so I'm constantly having to fix it.

2466
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,320
And it's like drifting.

2467
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:50,160
It feels like it's a Joy-Con drift or something.

2468
02:53:50,580 --> 02:53:51,740
It's driving me insane.

2469
02:53:51,740 --> 02:53:55,380
Like, I'm looking to the right right now.

2470
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:58,540
See, it slowly moves back.

2471
02:53:59,800 --> 02:54:02,320
It's like it's possessed, but not by me.

2472
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:07,220
It's so weird.

2473
02:54:07,480 --> 02:54:10,640
Thank you for the super chat, but I can't read it because I can't see.

2474
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:13,240
And because my computer...

2475
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:18,240
Okay, so I'm getting so frustrated about it.

2476
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:18,780
I'm really sorry.

2477
02:54:19,020 --> 02:54:22,100
Tech issues are like my number one pet peeve.

2478
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:25,500
Because I feel like it's beyond my control.

2479
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:29,560
But I spend so much money to try and fix it.

2480
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:32,260
And everything always messes up.

2481
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:36,860
Okay, but I had fun with Devil May Cry at least.

2482
02:54:37,140 --> 02:54:38,020
At least that was fun.

2483
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:40,620
And we got to fight Virgil again.

2484
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:43,280
And I'm really happy about that because it's always fun to fight him.

2485
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:45,120
Even though I beat him so quickly.

2486
02:54:51,140 --> 02:54:53,080
Next is... Next we will beat the game.

2487
02:54:53,180 --> 02:54:53,640
I promise.

2488
02:54:54,360 --> 02:54:59,160
Next I will... I might start like stream a little bit early in the day and just go until I beat it.

2489
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:05,780
So thank you guys.

2490
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:07,360
Thank you, thank you.

2491
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:13,800
I'm not... I will have to end it on OBS side and then try to find where you guys went.

2492
02:55:16,980 --> 02:55:21,360
I was going to ask for a Minto motivation beam, but since you have had...

2493
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:22,620
I'm looking to the right.

2494
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:25,040
Why am I looking to the left?

2495
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:27,620
iPhone, what is wrong with you?

2496
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:30,920
I don't understand.

2497
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:34,660
Why is my camera all messed up?

2498
02:55:37,680 --> 02:55:38,200
Sorry.

2499
02:55:38,200 --> 02:55:43,000
Since you are having computer issues, I'll give you a PC couldn't fixer beam instead.

2500
02:55:43,140 --> 02:55:44,020
Thank you.

2501
02:55:45,340 --> 02:55:47,100
I'm looking to the right.

2502
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:49,040
See, it's like confused.

2503
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:52,420
I don't know.

2504
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:53,700
Anyway, sorry.

2505
02:55:53,860 --> 02:55:55,180
I don't mean to complain so much.

2506
02:55:55,220 --> 02:55:55,820
I'm really sorry.

2507
02:55:56,020 --> 02:55:58,380
I'm just getting so frustrated by it all.

2508
02:55:58,380 --> 02:55:58,900
OK!

2509
02:55:59,340 --> 02:55:59,840
Osu Minto!

2510
02:56:00,100 --> 02:56:00,820
Thank you everybody!

2511
02:56:01,180 --> 02:56:01,700
See you!

2512
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:03,280
See you next time!

2513
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:06,380
We'll beat Devil May Cry 3 next time!

2514
02:56:06,700 --> 02:56:07,320
For sure!

2515
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:08,740
Bye bye!

2516
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:10,020
Thank you for all the motivation!

2517
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:12,220
Bye bye!

2518
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:19,540
I'm freaking out.

2519
02:56:20,100 --> 02:56:21,120
Everything is...
