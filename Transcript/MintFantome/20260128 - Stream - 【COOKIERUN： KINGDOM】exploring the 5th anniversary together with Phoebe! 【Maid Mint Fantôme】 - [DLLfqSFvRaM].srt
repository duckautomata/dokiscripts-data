00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,220
That's you!

25
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,980
The bee of the Phoebe variety, that's me!

26
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,760
We're both members of Densetsu.exe.

27
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,180
Everybody, go listen to Densetsu MVPs right now.

28
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,700
Actually, after this, after this.

29
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,380
Forever, lupin.

30
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,840
When we say MVP forever, we mean listen to it on repeat
forever.

31
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:27,860
Forever.

32
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,600
Yeah!

33
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,480
Do you want to do your intro?

34
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,280
Sure.

35
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,960
I love yours.

36
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,480
It's just so cute.

37
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,620
You too.

38
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,600
Oh, wait.

39
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,860
What if we did my call and response, but you can do the
response part.

40
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,960
Oh, okay, okay.

41
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,860
That'd be kind of cute, okay.

42
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,400
Okay.

43
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,360
The best times have no fee.

44
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,260
Who's the bee causing all the buzz?

45
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,140
Phoebe!

46
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,960
This is a dream come true.

47
00:05:59,380 --> 00:05:59,840
Ohachi!

48

Thanks for having me.

56
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,540
I said fee.

57
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,580
I didn't say there was no- The best times have no feet?

58
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,540
I'm not sound- No.

59
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,620
The best times do have feet.

60
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,260
Your feet.

61
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
The best times?

62
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,200
Probably include feet.

63
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,580
Probably include feet.

64
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,480
Probably.

65
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,760

Exactly.

How are you going to jam and jive without- I mean, you can
still wiggle.

69
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,520
You can, uh, you can shrimp around even if you got your
feet.

70
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:59,360
you know we still need to see Phoebe's famous shrimping move
on the shrimp actually it doesn't involve feet you're so

71
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:09,380
right it just involves me in the fetal position on the
ground yeah yeah so you don't need feet but I mean fun times

Cookie Run.

79
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,800
You, you know, I was thinking, I was like, oh my gosh,
Phoebe is so perfect for this, not just because of that, but

80
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,680
also because you also, you actually bake.

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,400
I love baking a lot and my favorite thing to make for
people.

thing to make for friends And I want to make for you one day

is my chocolate chip cookies that have taken many years of
adjustment to make just right.

Perhaps it's true.

88
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,660
Well, my, my mom's like, you can't just go spreading your
secret recipe everywhere like that.

89
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,960
And here I am like pinning it in my announcements channel on
my Discord.

90
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,040

Free food for Minto.

99
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,340
That's bad business.

100
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,540

101
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,880
Does that mean you're going to be there every day?

102
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,060
I might.

103
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,620
Worth.

104
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,120
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, baby.

105
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,920
Oh, baby!

106
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,280
You're still living in my house at that point.

107
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,160
Also try happy birthday!

108
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,960
Sorry, I missed it.

109
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,360
Oh my gosh, happy birthday!

110
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,880
Oh my gosh, someone said play Dokopon Kingdom at some point.

111
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,120
Have you heard of Dokopon Kingdom?

112
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,780
It is a friendship destroyer.

113
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,660
I just played one.

114
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,080
It is the friend.

115
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,580
You know, people say that like, Mario Party is a friendship
destroyer, but Dokopon Kingdom creates real enemies.

116
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,740
It really does.

117
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,780
Like, could we dance it to Dokopon?

118
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,680
That would be insane.

119
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,760
Wait, what if we did a special series?

120
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,700
I don't know if it'd be over like a week or a few weeks or
like a whole month where we do all of the friendship

121
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,240
challenge games and we see how powerful we are, how strong
our friendship is.

122
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,400
So we start at like easy level, which is like golf with
friends or something.

123
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,300
We're speedrunning our villain arc.

124
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,800
We are.

125
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Monopoly, Uno, Mario Party.

126
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,640
What else is there?

127
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,440
Among us?

128
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,320
Among us?

129
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,320
Maybe.

130
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,980
Does Amongas destroy friendships, does it?

131
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,640
I think it makes you question your friendship because you're
like, how did I know?

132
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,080
I never knew this person could be so deceitful.

133
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,620
I don't think I knew them from the beginning.

134
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,820
See, that's the pre-gaming for it.

135
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,160
That's the pre-gaming before golf with friends.

136
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,940
We played golf with friends.

137
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,320
That was fun though.

138
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,260
We was fine.

139
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,920
We were fine.

140
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,500
We were fine.

141
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,320
That was off-stream.

142
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
We were just playing games together.

143
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,500
Also, Phil, happy birthday.

144
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,580
Happy birthday.

145
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,800
So many birthdays.

146
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,140
Oh, Pico Park.

147
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,080
Oh, Pico Park.

148
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,660
Oh, my God.

149
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,360
Pico Party.

150
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:25,960
Pico Park?

151
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,620
Pico Party.

152
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,860
Pico Park.

153
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,880
Pico Park can be a Pico Party, it can.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,360
Yeah.

155
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,520
It ain't Pico Park without a Pico Party.

156
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,540
Without a Pico Party or the Pizza Party.

157
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,220
The Pizza Party for the Pico Party for the Pico Park.

158
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,640
Oh, that sounds good.

159
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,280
Pizza.

160
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,820
I know.

161
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,000
Go-to Toppings, Mint.

162
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,780
Go-to Toppings?

163
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:49,960
Yes.

164
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Okay.

165
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,560
I got this.

166
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,020
Spinach.

167
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:54,640
Whoa.

168
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,400
Sometimes feta cheese.

169
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,440
Green.

170
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,560
Green pepper.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,440
Pineapple.

172
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,080
Garlic.

173
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,180
That's my go-to pizza.

174
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,040
Okay.

175
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,600
All that sounded real good to me except for the pepper
because I'm a baby that is like.

176
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh, I mean, I'll eat my peppers if I have to.

177
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,520
If I have.

178
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,640
Well, green pepper is not like spicy or anything.

179
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,860
You just don't like red pepper or green pepper.

180
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,120
It's a little bitter for me.

181
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
Just a little bit.

182
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:27,960
But you know what?

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,240
But I'm growing up.

184
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,360
A lot of the foods that I've like started to acquire tastes
for as an adult, I acquire because I'm trying to like, I'm

185
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,520
trying to save face in front of people.

186
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,920
I don't care if you all hate my pizza.

187
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,100
That means I get to eat all of it.

188
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,700
So I don't care if you hate my pizza.

189
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,280
True.

190
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,100
That's true.

191
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,080
You don't have to share that.

192
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,360
to share.

193
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,200
Phoebe's growing up.

194
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,220
You're growing, you're all big now.

195
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,040
I'm growing up.

196
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,160
It's like, I'll always end up in a situation where I'm with,
like, a friend or a few friends, and then they'll be like,

197
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,760
oh, let's, each of us choose, like, a topping for pizza.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,200
Or each, I'll order sushi, and then you can order a sushi,
and we'll share.

199
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,520
And I'll order, like, my basic stuff.

200
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,520
And they'll be like, okay, um, for example, I only learned
that I love mushrooms because I did a thing.

201
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,660
with someone where i chose half the toppings and they chose
half and then they put mushrooms on it and i was too ashamed

202
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,820
to tell them i was scared of eating mushrooms don't be
afraid so i let them do it oh but then i ended up loving it

203
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:43,900
man i ended up liking it i was just afraid to try it we were
anti-mushroom together no we can be anti uh do you like

204
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:52,700
olives no okay we can be anti-olive actually thinking of
this just earlier because I was watching a video of someone

205
00:13:52,700 --> 00:14:01,460
that went on like a fancy it was like a it was like a super
fancy train that was in Japan and they were like and this is

206
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,800
the food that we were served and I was like you know every
time I watch those kinds of things where it's like this is

207
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:16,580
the fancy menu I'm like I think I I think I don't I think
I'm glad that I'm not a fancy rich person because... Give me

208
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,380
my mac and cheese and chicken nuggets.

209
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,740
Yes!

210
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,480
And my fries.

211
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,200
Yes!

212
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,500
I just...

213
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,780
Like, the menus are always so...

214
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm like, oh, that's what you guys are eating!

215
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,380
And they're small.

216
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,740
They're the tiniest portions ever.

217
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,040
I'm like, really?

218
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:34,840
Yeah!

219
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,400
Is this enough for you?

220
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,420
It's just... I just... Maybe, like...

221
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,580
Maybe if it's like a fancy meat, I'll be excited about it.

222
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,000
But everything I...

223
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:55,060
else, I'm like, oh, our arm waiter, mac and cheese, Mac and
cheese, Can I get a grown-up size of this kids menu mac and

224
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,920
cheese, please?

225
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,020
I don't know.

226
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,500
tiny portions, but many courses.

227
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,620
But at the same time, I get full so fast.

228
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,280
Do you?

229
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,460
I do like that, you know, if they're tiny portions of lots
of things and I get to try lots of stuff.

230
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,980
That's true.

231
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,260
And that sounds fun.

232
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,460
I have like...

233
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,240
Sometimes if you have too much of one thing.

234
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,020
You know.

235
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,280
Unless I really like it.

236
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,980
Then I'm like, more, please.

237
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,080
What's something that you could eat a ton of?

238
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,960
Mac and cheese.

239
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,720
Same, same.

240
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,860
We should just have a mac and cheese party sometime.

241
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,960
You brought it up and it's all I could think of right now.

242
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,480
Like five different mac and cheeses.

243
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,500
Spaghetti.

244
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,860
You and me and Ricky.

245
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,360
Yeah!

246
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,180
Oh, spaghetti.

247
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,200
Spaghetti.

248
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,000
Any kind of noodle, I think I'm good with.

249
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,320
with any pasta.

250
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,320
The pastas that they toss around in giant cheese wheels look
so good.

251
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,040
Aye, aye, yes!

252
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,560
Yeah, uh, yes!

253
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,700
Wait, that was you.

254
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,140
When you got the cheese bowl.

255
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,700
Oh, you're right!

256
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,220
You are so right!

257
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,040
Wait, you know, there was that one time when we went out to
a business dinner, but we decided that we both could

258
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,000
probably just share one on.

259
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:21,180
and then there was no debate about which one we wanted to
get because we both wanted like the lemon pasta option i

260
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:32,720
think we have a very similar taste i think so i think so
other than the mushrooms that that would do it that would do

261
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:43,880
it when i go to japan and they're like and i'm like uh i
like omurais that's my favorite japanese food And they're

262
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,160
like, Kawaii.

263
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,920
And I'm like, what do you mean, Kawaii?

264
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,420
It's just delicious.

265
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,680
It's just yummy.

266
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,500
Phoebe, I get it because I go to sushi restaurants and I
get, I get tamago.

267
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,920
I get the egg sushi.

268
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm like, it's so good.

269
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,940
It's like nice and sweet too.

270
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,600
Yeah, it's like got a little bit of sweetness.

271
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,380
And then they like have children's plates.

272
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,000
That's like shrimp and tamagoi.

273
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,520
or to the...

274
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,680
Yeah, it comes with a little ebby fry or something.

275
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,340
And I'm like...

276
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,240
This is made for me!

277
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,440
And when it comes to sushi too, I just get a lot...

278
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,920
I like getting a lot of salmon.

279
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,700
Oh yeah.

280
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,180
Oh my gosh.

281
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,820
Wait, when we go...

282
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:37,740
When we go, I'm gonna take you to sushi dough because they
have a salmon basil like with mozzarella cheese on top.

283
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,620
And it is...

284
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

285
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,460
I know what you're talking about.

286
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,220
Have you added it?

287
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,420
No.

288
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,900
Yeah, because there was one trip where I went to Sushido
like four times.

289
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,000
But it's like, they don't have like...

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,320
If you go to like Kura in the state, I love Kura, but
also...

291
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,260
They don't have the strange things.

292
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,020
You would think that an American version of it would have
like...

293
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,700
The cheese, sushi and stuff.

294
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,020
Right, right, right.

295
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:03,660
No.

296
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,340
Japan.

297
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,340
Yeah, Japan has some wacky things.

298
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,300
It's so good though.

299
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,120
They had one with like a prosciutto and cheese or something.

300
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

301
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,520
Yes, yes.

302
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,080
Yeah, those are so good.

303
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah, guys, it's my suggestion.

304
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,820
If you go to sushi dough, the salmon basil is so...

305
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,700
It's actually, like, afterlife changing.

306
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,420
It's so stinking good.

307
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,460
Afterlife changing is cute.

308
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,980
It's so yummy.

309
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
Yes, I recommend.

310
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,620
What?

311
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,960
You might just ascend to heaven if you have too much of it.

312
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,760
I'd be careful.

313
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,000
You're right.

314
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:50,920
I do go sometimes with some friends And they'll literally
get like five plates of it Oh I thought you meant go to

315
00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:01,740
heaven Oh my gosh They're in heaven when they're eating five
plates of salmon basil sushi I think that we should go and

316
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:10,860
eat five plates of salmon basil sushi I think we could do it
easy Yeah yeah Easily we might have to up it to like 10 Oh

317
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,660
wait what's your max plate number for like A sushi, like a
kaiten sushi like that.

318
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,300
I've never counted.

319
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,860
But you know what?

320
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,700
I try my best to get to the 15 at Kura so I can get a prize.

321
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,520
However, it's not...

322
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,220
I've never been without help before.

323
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,400
Okay, okay.

324
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,920
Because my max, I think, is like, seven.

325
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,180
But I usually go, like, five or six plates.

326
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,560
Yeah, I think seven's about the same.

327
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,520
Six or seven is about...

328
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:40,680
No.

329
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,680
No.

330
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,380
Don't make that face.

331
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm not gonna do it.

332
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,140
I'm not gonna do it.

333
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,800
Six or...

334
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,940
But in all seriousness...

335
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,140
For your sake, I won't do it.

336
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,000
I will combat the brain worms.

337
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,420
I will combat them.

338
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,840
But yes, in all seriousness, six or seven plates is probably
my typical max.

339
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,060
But then...

340
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,580
But then I want those prizes.

341
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,220
But that's when I go with groups, you know.

342
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,620
Yeah, but I don't actually go to Kura in the States very
much.

343
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,560
I usually go to Sushiro.

344
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,780
I don't think they do prizes.

345
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,320
At Sushiro?

346
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,600
I don't think so.

347
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,200
Yeah, I don't think so.

348
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,760
No.

349
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,040
No.

350
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,540
But they sometimes have the fun touch screens.

351
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,280
Oh, yeah.

352
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:27,780
Yeah.

353
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,280
They do.

354
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
With games sometimes.

355
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,120
I don't know if they're games, but little challenges and
stuff.

356
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,840
They cheat you.

357
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,420
I did it.

358
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:35,900
They do.

359
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,260
I did it once and it was just like, oh, you're going to get
the prize.

360
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,800
And then I don't even know what the prize is because I've
never won.

361
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,880
I just believe there are no prizes.

362
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,780
Oh.

363
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,540
At least it's cheating you.

364
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,220
Yeah, at least with Kura, you get like the little gotcha
porn, right?

365
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,260
Right.

366
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,580
Damn, I've got enough gotcha in my life already as it is.

367
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,500
I don't need my sushi restaurant to also get my hopes up
like that.

368
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,140
But...

370
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,500
Mmm.

371
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,740
The prizes are cute sometimes.

372
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,440
They really are.

373
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,500
We are going to gotcha today.

374
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes, we are.

375
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:21,920
yes the cool thing though about cookie run is that they're
so generous like i mean i guess you haven't played as much

376
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:29,380
of it as i have but i was able to be pretty like free to
play for a long time i just like to get the monthly passes

377
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:35,880
because they come with cute items oh yeah yeah if i like a
game like you know i like i will support it with like a

378
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:43,640
monthly something or other you know like yeah a monthly
something yeah yeah but not yeah we got we We got some

379
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,940
self-control though.

380
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,520
We're doing our best.

381
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,020
We're doing our best.

382
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,940
We're hanging in.

383
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,020
Unless it's like a character that I'm like, I must have.

384
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,660
I...

385
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,000
Right.

386
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,820
I have gone a little crazy before.

387
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,080
But I can probably count on the number of one hand how many
times I've gone crazy.

388
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:08,900
Phoebe.

389
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,640
How many fingers you got on that one hand?

390
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:28,760
I was born with six Yeah, I The amount of times I've Gone in
really hard for a character It's been that And that many

391
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:43,040
times Honestly for me But sometimes I want to be strong I
guess I guess Hmm Hmm Sometimes I want to do good in people

392
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:49,280
That has honestly, like, been a little bit more of a
motivator for me than even collecting my favorite

393
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,540
characters.

394
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,420
I feel like the characters I end up liking, I'm lucky.

395
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,640
In some games, they end up being, like, the free character
or something like that.

396
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,800
And I'm very lucky.

397
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,980
But then, I want to get strong.

398
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm tired of being trampled underfoot in PvP.

399
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,620
No, waifu over meta.

400
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,700
No, waifu over meta, Phoebe!

401
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,740
You know what that reminds me of is when...

402
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:22,520
When I was little, playing Fire Emblem Awakening on the 3DS,
I would like, it was like the first Fire Emblem that

403
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,160
introduced a shipping mechanic and like children mechanic
and stuff.

404
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,060
And I shipped the characters based on how, how like their
chemistry and how cute I thought they were together.

405
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,120
But then all my friends were kind of like, no, I shipped
them for the stats.

406
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,960
Because if you ship these two characters together, they have
a higher stats.

407
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,780
And I was like, no!

408
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,600
No!

409
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,520
Love over Love over Nana.

410
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,620
Love over Nana.

411
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,140
It's like breeding Pokemon.

412
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,620
You know, when you breed them for the best stats and stuff.

413
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,120
Breeding your soldiers for stats.

414
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,120
It sounds so bad.

415
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,140
No.

416
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,120
But people go crazy over that kind of stuff.

417
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:15,300
They're just like, oh yeah, my Pikachu has this attack and
my other Pikachu has this together they will create the

418
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:27,140
ultimate weapon I mean good for them but but you got
different priorities different different strokes for

419
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:40,640
different folks so true yeah so true I'm not sweaty enough
oh yeah you're not sweaty enough yeah well unfortunate oh

420
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,000

get i'm i'm actually i get nervous with like sponsored

421
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,920
streams so i'll get a little sweaty later oh oh i see i see
i see i see yeah yeah anyway what are you excited what do

422
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:07,720
you i'm excited to see what cookies you end up you end up
liking yeah i was going through some of And honestly, I was

423
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,080
like, I was like, oh my gosh, this character, this cookie is
so cute.

424
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,900
And then I was like, wait, this is like their alt outfits.

425
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,660
Like the outfits that they have are so stinking cute.

426
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,880
Oh my gosh, they have such good outfits too.

427
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,340
Yeah.

428
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,060
Which is like the end of me.

429
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,880
Because I'm like, oh, okay, I'm saving up my gems for these
cute cookies.

430
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,120
And I love them so much.

431
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,080
Now I can dress them up.

432
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,680
And the outfits are, the outfit designs are actually peak.

433
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,200
But that's a different currency than the regular.

434
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,720
currency, oh.

435
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,620
You gotta, you gotta, uh, you gotta strategize.

436
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,940
There's lots of ways to earn.

437
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,340
There really is.

438
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,100
However, there's also lots of cute outfits.

439
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,480
So you gotta, you gotta figure out who your priorities,
where your priorities lie.

440
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,780
Can I guess later who your favorite cookie?

441
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,120
Oh wait, there's like so many.

442
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,160
There's like over a hundred.

443
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,100
There's so many now.

444
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,120
If it was like, if this was like a year or two ago, then you
maybe you would have been able to, but there's, there's so

445
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,340
many.

446
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,980
But that means there's like a cookie for everyone out there.

447
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,320
Like how there's a Pokemon for...

448
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,540
I like to think...

449
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:15,480
Going back to Pokemon a little bit, I like to think that
every single Pokemon has somebody out there who loves them.

450
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,320
Like every Pokemon is someone's favorite out there.

451
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,560
Yeah, I actually...

452
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,840
I think there was like someone trying to do that.

453
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,500
They were like, I have this Excel sheet and like I'm going
through comments and say who your favorite Pokemon is.

454
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:35,320
And I will mark it down to see like if every Pokemon out
there has a...

455
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,640
has someone that loves them it's like when you go to the
Pokemon store in Japan and there's like a random Pokemon

456
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,340
that's a plushie and it's like a nice merch for like a
random like what are you happy?

457
00:26:49,080 --> 00:27:01,180
and you're just like somebody does love you who's what's a
random one um Dunspars Dunspars somebody does love a

458
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Dunspars it's one of my favorites I'm so basic.

459
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,540
I love Gengar.

460
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,080
But I do...

461
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,900
Gengar's cool.

462
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,520
I love Gengar.

463
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,320
I love Chandelure.

464
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,620
I love...

465
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,680
I need ghosty, really.

466
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Well, that makes sense.

467
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,980
You would definitely...

468
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,740
I mean, you have to be a ghost trainer.

469
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,800
You would have to be.

470
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,680
Yeah, of course.

471
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:31,720
I would like to imagine if I were in, like, a Pokemon world,
I would be, like, the Hex Maniac, but, like, a little more,

472
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
like, Lolita in...

473
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,840
No, that really you would be!

474
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,040
I am manifesting art of this right now.

475
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm manifesting fan art of this.

476
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,860
There's a girl in like the new game and she's very cute.

477
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,160
And wait, she has like a chandelure.

478
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,080
Wait, does anybody know her name?

479
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,180
Yeah, I don't look her up.

480
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:57,940
Help!

481
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,220
Help!

482
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,120
Help!

483
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,240
Help!

484
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,660
She's...

485
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,200
Gwen?

486
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,940
Gwen.

487
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,040
Gwen.

488
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,160
Oh my gosh.

489
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,040
Yeah, she's so cute.

490
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,160
She's so cute.

491
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,940
I think if I were alive, I would look like her.

492
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,720
Yes, I think you would.

493
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,280
Surely, surely when you were alive and kicking, you were
kicking in this fit right here.

494
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,000
Mm-hmm.

495
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,800
She's so stinky.

496
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,280
The.

497
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:42,000
fairy tale girl just random random like trainer that you can
come across in the wild in Pokemon that's me fairy tale girl

498
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:58,460
fairy tale girl Pokemon oh yes that is that is Phoebe yes
Phoebe that's you that is the boy she's so cute she's really

499
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:06,120
cute she's got a forehead on her You can do tic-tac-toe on
that forehead.

500
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,060
Oh yeah.

501
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,420
That's a good forehead.

502
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,760
I think if you pushed both of our bangs up, we would both
have really big foreheads too.

503
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:21,140
Which I think, honestly, I got no issue because that's more
surface area to give a little soft kisses.

504
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,340
Little forehead kisses.

505
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,380
You're so cute, Vipi, you're so right.

506
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,520
We can have our little foreheads covered.

507
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,720
No pieces.

508
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,400
Though we say that, but I feel like our communities might
just play tic-tac-toe on the foreheads instead.

509
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,680
Yeah, I think.

510
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,200
Probably.

511
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,060
They would like.

512
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,500
Yeah, it's okay.

513
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,600
I'll give you a little forehead kiss.

514
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,900
I'll give you forehead kisses.

515
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,320
Yeah, they would draw stupid stuff.

516
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,200
They would be like, I'm with stupid and like draw an arrow
down.

517
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,340
Arrow down.

518
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,520
Cruel and unusual punishment.

519
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,580
Your bangs move so much, I'm watching them.

520
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
I'm, like, mesmerized by them.

521
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,000
Oh, thank you.

522
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,500
I love how bouncy my hair is.

523
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,740
I love your little curls.

524
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,240
They make me so happy.

525
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,720
They also look like a yummy ice cream, and I kind of just
want...

526
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,540
I've been thinking about straightening my hair recently.

527
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,320
Oh, really?

528
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:24,920
Yeah.

529
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,440
Like, straightening it more.

530
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,160
The curls, the waves are natural.

531
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,540
Yeah, usually, yeah.

532
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,940
It's just kind of like how the ectoplasm lays.

533
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,020
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

534
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,080
Man, some people would kill for those waves.

535
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
They're so nice.

536
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,640
I can't believe they're all natural.

537
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,740
What about yours?

538
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,080
I got some natural waves as well.

539
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,020
Except they wave in whatever way they want to.

540
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,540
And sometimes not in the way that I want them to.

541
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,660
Someone asked, can we play battleship on y'all's foreheads?

542
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,060
Probably.

543
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,200
Probably.

544
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,360
Can you?

545
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Yes.

546
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,900
Should you?

547
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,600
Yes.

548
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,340
Is the question.

549
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,980
We'll just lie down.

550
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,680
It'll like... Actually, I feel like that would be kind of
relaxing to like...

551
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,840
You know, like when someone plays with your hair or
something?

552
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,100
Like, just having like someone on your...

553
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,340
Play with your forehead.

554
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,060
Look, how about this?

555
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,360
You can play battleship or whatever you want on my forehead
if you also give headpads at the same time.

556
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,220
So true.

557
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:42,260
equivalent experience oh that's been one of my dreams is to
like go to a head spa as well you haven't been i've never

558
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:51,620
been wait you've been yeah oh my gosh wait how is it is it
as amazing it's it's amazing everybody everybody here should

559
00:31:51,620 --> 00:32:00,160

like for real it's so oh my gosh it's okay wait i have this

560
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,680
one place that i I have a place that I love in Japan.

00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,760
I will take you.

562
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,340
Oh, I would love that.

563
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,080
I would love that.

564
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,140
I love that.

565
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,680
Yeah.

566
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:18,820
Because it's like, I don't know, I feel like you get a lot
of tension around your head when you're like, just like, you

567
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,760
get stressed out, you know?

568
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,820
Yeah, exactly.

569
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,520
And a lot of them will do kind of like a shoulder massage
too.

570
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,140
So you get, you get a lot of, oh man.

571
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,920
Oh, it's so nice.

572
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,920
It's so nice.

573
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:32,760
Yeah.

574
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:40,300
You wouldn't think with like ectoplasm, but it does, it gets
kind of nodded, like it gets all bunched up in spots.

575
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,720
You gotta massage the ectoplasm, make it nice and squimsy
again.

576
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,760
Yeah, it's like a dough, you know?

577
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,160
Yeah.

578
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,880
Mint is a cookie, confirm.

579
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,340
I'm a cookie!

580
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,920
It's gone, Kit Kat.

581
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,620
Happy birthday!

582
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,800
Happy birthday!

583
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,720
Would you say?

584
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,660
Oh, you're sweet!

585
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,360
Look at cookie!

586
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,340
No, I think you're sweet.

587
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,640
Different flavors of cookie.

588
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,420
If we were a cookie, what flavor would you be?

589
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,060
I mean, probably a honey cookie.

590
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,740
Though, to be honest, I haven't made like...

591
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,820
I have not made honey cookies myself before, so how would
that even...

592
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,060
I don't know.

593
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,560
I don't even...

594
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,820
I don't think I've ever tried one.

595
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:29,260
Yeah.

596
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,680
Mmm.

597
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,960
But I love honey.

598
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:39,600
Maybe something like I've um some people you can use flowers
like not just for decoration and like cooking and baking but

599
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:48,000
also you can like bake them into things and And they can
like add a little bit of an aroma to it and And yeah so

600
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,220
maybe something with some honey and flowers.

601
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,640
I need to try your baking I really want you to try well one
day I will bake for you.

602
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,200
I promise.

603
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,040
I'm excited

604
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,360
Probably, right?

605
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,660
I feel like that, like a, was a thin mint?

606
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,100
Yeah, like a thin mint!

607
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,180
Yeah, I'm very...

608
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,760
Now wait for Girl Scout season to come around.

609
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,560
Oh, yeah.

610
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,180
What's your favorite Girl Scout cookie?

611
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,740
Well, I do like thin mints, to be honest.

612
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,960
Especially with, like, a milk.

613
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,300
But...

614
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,200
Oh, yeah.

615
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,520
What was it?

616
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,820
The, um...

617
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
I was just told this recently, too.

618
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:42,360
Samoa's I really like A lot of people love Samoa I know a
lot of people who Samoa's are their favorite Yeah they're

619
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,940

620
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,800
There were these like They were called Lemon Smiles or
something like this Yeah!

621
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:57,540
They had like the powdered sugar on them And they were so
good I haven't seen them in so long I wonder if they still

622
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:04,940

that they make in different areas too that are like a little

623
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,240
like they're thin and they got like a little lemon like
frosting layer on the bottom too those were my favorite

Scout I was not do I seem like I would be I don't know maybe

625
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:33,420

like everybody you were a Girl Scout I was deep in Girl

626
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,780
Scout.

627
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,100
I feel like every girl is a Girl Scout because I was so
like...

628
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,360
I was in.

629
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,740
Every girl's got the Girl Scout potential in them.

630
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,140
Uh-huh.

631
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,520
Wait, there's so many new ones now that I'm looking at on
their website that looks so good.

632
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,180
Girl Scout cookies.

633
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,720
I think I'm just hungry and I definitely want cookies.

634
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,020
Same, same.

635
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,800
Oh, they got...

636
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,860
Whoa, Adventurfuls.

637
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,300
Yeah, that's what I was looking at.

638
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,920
Caramel flavored cream.

639
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,220
We're going to make everybody hungry.

640
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:13,380
Oh, I mean, this stream was going to devolve into food talk
at some point.

641
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:13,740
That's so true.

642
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,560
That's so true.

643
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,760
We got to get it out of our system because we can't eat the
cookie run cookies.

644
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,300
We got to eat regular cookies.

645
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,500
Oh, the peanut butter ones are good, too.

646
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,060
Yeah, I would be...

647
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,960
Oh, there was a smore one that was good.

648
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,780
The what one?

649
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,180
There was a smore one that was really good, too.

650
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,340
You know what?

651
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,760
I don't know.

652
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,780
Last time I bought Girl Scout cookies.

653
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,260
Maybe I'm a fake Girl Scout.

654
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,340
Oh, no.

655
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,700
It's like...

656
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:46,800
Nowadays, I feel like when we were like little kids in
school, there were lots of opportunities to buy Girl Scout

657
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,600
cookies because like our classmates would have them.

658
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,200
Oh, toasties.

660
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,100
I also liked toasties.

661
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,980
Toasties.

662
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,480
What the heck?

663
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,640
What is that one?

664
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah.

665
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,700
Oh, that one that like had...

666
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:09,000
a snickerdoodle like a like a like a ginger cookie with like
a frosting on the bottom that sounds so good oh that sounds

667
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,820
good they just got rid of them like literally last month or
something what the heck why would they do that french toast

668
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:28,420
inspired cookies dipped in delicious icing oh why'd they get
rid of it why yeah what a cute name to a toastier toastier

669
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,940
would be outside of like grocery stores and I would go up to
people and be like, do you want to buy cookies?

670
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:46,460
How can like how many times would they like say yes out of
like five?

671
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,640
I don't know.

672
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,780
It's been so long now.

673
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,620
I don't know.

674
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,380
I have such a hard time saying no to girl stuff that are
trying to sell me cookies.

675
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,340
Me too because partially because of the cookies.

676
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,480
I know how difficult it was before when I did it.

677
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,100
So I'm like, yeah, I'll buy your cookies.

678
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,200
But the boxes are like $7 a box or something.

679
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,460
So it's like...

680
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,560
I know.

681
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,340
Inflation.

682
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,060
Recession indicator.

683
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,640
The price of Girl Scout cookies going on.

684
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,880
They're crazy expensive now, but they're still so delicious.

685
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,240
So I'll get like a box or two.

686
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:21,980
At least.

687
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,380
Yummy.

688
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,740
Yummy.

689
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,720
When is Girl Scout cookie season?

690
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,480
Oh, it feels like all the time now, but at the same time...

691
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:34,920

695
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,160
Oh, so now!

696
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,580
Now!

697
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,760
Get your cookies!

698
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,740
Get your cookies!

699
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,920
That's your cookies!

700
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,380
That's your cookies!

701
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,580
Oh my gosh.

702
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,740
I am getting hungry.

703
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,040
I don't need to.

704
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,200
No.

705
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,840
I got a bag of nuts right here.

706
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,860
Oh yeah, handful of nuts, baby.

707
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,460
Handful of nuts.

708
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:09,840
That's me.

709
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,240
Handful of nuts, cookie.

710
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,060
Do it.

711
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,060
Oh, I hear the crunch.

712
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,780
You can hear it crunch?

713
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,400
Can you guess the nut?

714
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,240
Almond.

715
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,740
The nut expert right here.

716
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,860
Oh my gosh.

717
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,500
I could tell from the crunch.

718
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,440
Wow, wait, wow!

719
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,060
That's actually really impressive!

720
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,920
That's really impressive!

721
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,220
Now, when I think about it though, if it was like walnuts,
there would be barely any crust.

722
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

723
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,300
Or like a cashew even, like it would be pretty soft.

724
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,440
It's like kind of like an in-between.

725
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,360
You're right.

726
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,240
That crunch could only be an almond.

727
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,560
You're so big brain.

728
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,340
What?

729
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,260
It could have been a peanut, I guess too.

730
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,700
But it sounded like deeper than like a peanut crunch.

731
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,600
Does that make sense?

732
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,480
Yeah, it's like a heavier crunch.

733
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,840
Yeah, yeah, I sound like a heavier crunch.

734
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,720
I'm learning so much.

735
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,960
One day this knowledge will be useful.

736
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,460
I'll like...

737
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,180
I don't think so.

738
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,740
No, I think so.

739
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,560
I'll be held hostage.

740
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,940
And then they'll be like, you cannot escape this room until
you guess exactly what kind of nut the other hostage in the

741
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,180
room next to you is eating.

742
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,000
Listen through this payphone.

743
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,400
I put the payphone up to my ear.

744
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:33,980
Oh, my God.

745
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
And I hear a deep crunch.

746
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,900
And I'm like, and then I'll flash back to this moment.

747
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,000
To you being like, it's an almond.

748
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,200
Because it has a deeper crunch.

749
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,520
And then I'll be like, thank you, Mint.

750
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,920
A single tear will fall.

751
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,560
And I'll be like, sir, it's an almond.

752
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,380
And they'll be like, how?

753
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,780
How could you have known?

754
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,520
How could you have known?

755
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,360
I guess we'll release both you and the other hostage.

756
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:10,560
I'm like imagining the kidnapper as like, as like jigsaw
voice and he's like do you want to hear a crunch and it's

757
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:23,860
like precisely exactly yeah i think i think honestly like
almonds cashews and walnuts would be pretty easy

758
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:34,340
wait maybe i just okay a lot of nuts Walnut is like a soft,
barely crunch.

759
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,220
Yeah, yeah.

760
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,980
And an almond is a heavy, big crunch.

761
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

762
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,300
What about a cashew?

763
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,980
I don't eat cashews very often.

764
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,240
I know that they're like, they're like little guy shaped.

765
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:44,780
Yeah.

766
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,440
But like, it's like a little shrimp.

767
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,380
A little shrimp.

768
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,960
A little shrimp.

769
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,420
Yeah, shrimp.

770
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,800
I think it's like right in the middle of an almond and a
walnut.

771
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,740
And a walnut.

772
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,280
Oh.

773
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:01,360
So that's the, the, the nut softness meter.

774
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,440
The nut softness meter.

775
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,080
Walnut, cashew, almond.

776
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,920
Almond is definitely the crunchiest, I believe.

777
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,460
And peanuts.

778
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,300
Your peanuts fall on the nut softness meter.

779
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,380
They're awesome.

780
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,740
I don't know what it is, though.

781
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,560
There's just a bit about an almond that makes such a
specific sound.

782
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,060
But peanuts are also quite crunchy.

783
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,780
They just don't have as deep of a crunch.

784
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,900
They have like a lighter.

785
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,620
So there may be between...

786
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,720
Oh, what are those guys called?

787
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,380
Oh, cashews and almonds.

788
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,280
Yeah.

789
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,460
Maybe.

790
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,760
It's like, it's like still like a crunchy crunch, but it's
the pitch is higher.

791
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,680
Um, peanuts are legume.

792
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,540
We were at the same exact time.

793
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,660
I don't care.

794
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,880
Yeah, um, I don't care.

795
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:05,870
Nice.

796
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:08,650
Nice.

797
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,930
I'm sorry, guys.

798
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:16,810
We're just hungry.

799
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,410
I have, like, dinner waiting for me.

800
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,750
I'll eat it after stream.

801
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,010
I'm excited.

802
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,430
What kind of dinner are you going to have?

803
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,370
I have, like, some stuffed bell peppers.

804
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,750
Oh, the peppers again.

805
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,170
What are they stuffed with?

806
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,450
Meat and cheese.

807
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:43,290
Oh, maybe that would make up for the fact that they're
stuffed inside peppers maybe i would eat yeah i am i gotta

808
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:50,310
go up i gotta i gotta eat my bell by my peppers you don't
eat i wonder what the nutritional what is like a nutritional

809
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:59,410
value of a bell pepper though like i know they probably are
like vitamin a or something i don't know vitamin something

810
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:09,510
yes vitamin p someone said the roasting takes out a lot of
the harshness of the peppers but green peppers are pretty

811
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:15,070
bitter but red peppers and yellow peppers aren't maybe I
should try.

812
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:22,870
I should start easy mode with the the yellow and red ones
and then I'll go up to green ones and then I'll go up to

813
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,710
jalapenos.

814
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,090
Oh wait.

815
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,830
And then I'll go up to ghost peppers.

816
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,730
Wait, wait, wait.

817
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,490
I am going to grab a snack though because we are talking
about I have some.

818
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,950
Yeah, please do.

819
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,570
I have some crackers here.

820
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,210
Ooh!

821
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:40,650
Yay!

822
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,350
Some cheese for those crackers.

823
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,450
I did earlier.

824
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:46,750
I did.

825
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,790
Can you hear him?

826
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,450
I can.

827
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,290
Sorry.

828
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,090
I did at the start.

829
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,130
It's okay.

830
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:57,890
Hold on.

831
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,230
Yummy.

832
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:07,130
Yummy.

833
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,070
Sorry we're talking about food so much, you guys.

834
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,730
You guys can crunch with us.

835
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,390
It's the crunching stream.

836
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,850
Crunchy stream.

837
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,830
Yeah, you'll have to work up to a ghost pepper one day.

838
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,030
Can you handle spicy food well?

839
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:29,610
Oh, yeah.

840
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:30,550
Yeah.

841
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,110
Give me any spice.

842
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,510
I can tank it.

843
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,330
Wow.

844
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,650
Yeah, don't reach out.

845
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,370
I believe you, Mint.

846
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:50,810
I believe you.

847
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,790
There's no way you would lie to me.

848
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,690
Yeah, of course, of course, of course.

849
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:57,530
No, no, no.

850
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,850
We're closer than that.

851
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,590
Exactly.

852
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,110
I have no reason to lie to you, honestly.

853
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,150
Yeah, no reason, no reason at all.

854
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,330
Not to impress you or anything.

855
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,010
No, of course.

856
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,570
That's why I'm going to be bringing...

857
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,410
Extra spicy curry, just the way you like it.

858
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,890
Next time I see you.

859
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,270
You can handle spice?

860
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,980
Probably not as well as you.

861
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,220
You're like the spice expert.

862
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,320
You're super spicy.

863
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,500
That's literally what they call me.

864
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,140
Super spicy.

865
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:36,680
Yeah.

866
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,380
Mint spicy phantom.

867
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,560
That's your full name.

868
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,300
You know, though, I can only have a curry on a full moon.

869
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,140
So, I might not even...

870
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:47,700
On a full moon?

871
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:54,620
Yeah, depending on the time of the day, year, the seasons, I
don't know if I'll be able to have it.

872
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,200
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

873
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,240
That's so sad.

874
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, then I'll just make sure to visit you on the next full
moon.

875
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,520
It's also...

876
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,360
I forgot to...

877
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,840
Also, and also Jupiter and Venus need to be aligned.

878
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,920
Can you be aligned?

879
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,020
Oh, shoot.

880
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,200
It's so specific.

881
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:25,740
get to have curry ever oh that sucks so bad on a leap year
well on a leap year that's crazy when is the next leap year

882
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,400

year

883
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:42,220
2028 oh in two years i can have curry again maybe if i can
have curry again well here's the thing then then i can just

884
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,420

885
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,260
Every day I'll add one more pepper to it.

886
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:57,920
And then it'll be just the way you like it by the time that
Jupiter and Venus are aligned and there's a full moon on a

887
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,600
leap year.

888
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,560
It has healing properties.

889
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,760
Did I mention that Oprah Winfrey needs to be there?

890
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,120
Damn, I'm gonna call her up right now!

891
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,460
We have plans in two years, Oprah!

892
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,210
It's okay.

893
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:26,630
mint it's all right you know what we can have we can have
lots and lots of mint ice cream there as well because well

894
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:36,830
there was there was one time when uh um i used to work at
this like after school program and the bosses the super

895
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:45,550
duper strict bosses were away on a vacation for like a week
leaving me and the other like college-aged kids in the

896
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,710
office by ourselves.

897
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:54,310
And what the guys in the office did was bring in like super
duper spicy hot sauce.

898
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,630
Like the challenge kind.

899
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:57,430
Oh my god.

900
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,010
And the...

901
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:09,250
For the sake of not dying, the fridge in the office was
filled with milk and such.

902
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,310
Okay.

903
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,130
This sounds just like the kind of thing that a bunch of
college kids left alone.

904
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:23,810
onto their own devices while the parents are gone would do
it really dies the the first guy that tried it he like ran

905
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:30,910
to the bathroom crying so sad i was like you left your milk
you let the milk it's it's here why did he go to the

906
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:41,620
bathroom i don't know there's no milk in there why would he
go to the bathroom there's no milk no what a dummy i'm not

907
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,580
gonna think about it too much i know

908
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,060
No, I don't think so either.

909
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,240
Wait, what's the spiciest thing you can handle then?

910
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,360
Mm-hmm.

911
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:04,560
Well, there was a time recently when a friend of mine made,
like, Korean army stew, which is, like, just take a bunch

912
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:12,060
of, like, a Shin rambun and stuff, and then put, like, just,
like, throw a bunch of stuff in there, like, a mushroom,

913
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,780
anoki mushrooms, and sausages, and a bunch of yummy stuff.

914
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,020
But then this friend put like all the spice packets for all
the Shin Ramiyons because it was like a big pot of it So

915
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:30,920
several packets of Shin Ramiyon were used, but then you
probably shouldn't use All of the spice packets too And that

916
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:41,680
was like My nose was running Oh I was crying a little bit
But it was delicious I could eat it Can I tank it?

917
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,720
Will it hurt?

918
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:56,920
Well your stomach regret it probably probably but it was
tasty it was so yummy i i do avoid spice when i can though

919
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:06,380
you're stronger than i am i think i would be sent beyond the
afterlife i think i just might reincarnate it would just you

920
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:13,600
think oh no i i would get sent past heaven i do not collect
$200.

921
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,220
Do not stop and go.

922
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,340
Like, I just just straight into a new body.

923
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,520
No!

924
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,720
We don't want that.

925
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,040
Okay.

926
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,040
You know what?

927
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,140
I'm gonna cancel that two years from now curry party.

928
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,820
Let's just do ice cream instead.

929
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,640
Let's do ice cream instead.

930
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:36,220
Yeah.

931
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,880
I'll bake you some cookies.

932
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,720
What if I become lactose intolerant in two years?

933
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:54,800
so i was just talking to someone about this the other day oh
no you can like you can like exposure therapy yourself into

934
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:05,640
getting rid of your lactose intolerance and i know because i
did it to myself it's a mindset it's a mindset lactose

935
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,420
intolerance is a skill issue

936
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:17,440
just take it Yeah, so like, I wasn't lactose intolerant for
most of my life.

937
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,440
But I loved, so I loved cheese.

938
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:26,680
And then at some point, when I, when I got into college, I
like suddenly was lactose intolerant for some reason.

939
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,980
But I tanked it until I no longer was lactose intolerant
anymore.

940
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,560
And it only took a couple of years.

941
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,780
So, yeah.

942
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,820
Be the change you want to see in the world.

943
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,260
Exactly.

944
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,580
do it.

945
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,860
I believe in you.

946
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,380
You can be whatever you want it to be and your gut biome can
be whatever you want it to be.

947
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,380
A couple years.

948
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,900
Wait, so what is the method that you do?

949
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,940
What is, what do you do?

950
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,020
You ignore it.

951
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,460
You eat whatever the heck you want.

952
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,500
Probably like have a lot.

953
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,680
Have like dairy on a regular basis.

954
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:18,720
You ignore the bathroom or you just oh no you you just you
tank the bathroom you tank it and then eventually it won't

955
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:26,020
happen anymore you know in a couple years everybody in a
couple of years well you're not lactose intolerant though

956
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:33,540
right now are you i don't think so oh good let's let's hope
it stays that way how would you know maybe if i i'll test it

957
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,800
i'll eat a bunch of cheese and then see yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah

958
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:41,880
Yeah!

959
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,940
Wait, yeah, I've had so much mac and cheese.

960
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,780
I think I'm good.

961
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,800
I think I'm not.

962
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,420
Yeah, you're probably good.

963
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,560
I believe in you.

964
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,520
If you don't eat dairy for a long time, though, do you think
you'd become lactose intolerant?

965
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,800
I feel like you might.

966
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,120
I feel like...

967
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:07,640
I feel like if you don't eat like anything for a long period
of time, then your body may become less tolerant of it,

968
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,180
possibly.

969
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,840
Oh, that's how it works.

970
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,820
Oh my gosh.

971
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,080
I'll lose the tolerance.

972
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,280
I gotta keep eating cheese.

973
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,060
Yeah.

974
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,040
That's you.

975
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,720
I gotta keep it up.

976
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,780
You're doing a great job.

977
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,400
You've been doing the great job so far.

978
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,820
Says you're definitely certified nutritionist, Phoebe.

979
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,420
Uh-huh.

980
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,040
Keep it up, Minto.

981
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,560
A cheese a day keeps the lactose intolerance away.

982
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,120
Yeah.

983
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:39,580
Yeah.

984
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,800
Keep cheeses.

985
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,760
Keep cheesing.

986
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,920
I'm always cheesing.

987
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,020
Favorite, do you have a favorite cheese?

988
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,160
You know, I'm a basic, I'm a basic ghost and I just like
cheddar.

989
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,320
Like a super sharp cheddar though.

990
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,800
Well, no.

991
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,640
I mean, that's not, that's not that basic.

992
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,720
Like, is it because like there are different kinds of
cheddars, like you said.

993
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,560
Oh, that's true.

994
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:05,960
That's true.

995
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,260
Yeah, I love a sharp cheddar.

996
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,480
An umbrella term, a sharp one.

997
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:22,240
mouth oh yeah oh god there is there's like i love waffles
but sometimes they just like cut the roof of your mouth when

998
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:31,380
they're like when they're too toasty i think i'm thinking in
particular ego waffles probably i feel like ego waffles are

999
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:39,440
so soft what i don't know what it is maybe it's like belgian
well something there was something that i would put in my

1000
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,380
mouth that would like cut the roof of it.

1001
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,360
I don't remember what it was.

1002
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,380
It might have been baguettes.

1003
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,640
It might have been baguettes.

1004
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,380
Like a hard, not pastry, a hard, like, oh, Captain Crunch.

1005
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,680
There you go.

1006
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,480
Captain Crunch.

1007
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,540
Where did you get waffles for Captain Crunch?

1008
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,600
I don't know.

1009
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,900
They look a little similar.

1010
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,740
Not Captain.

1011
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,160
Not that guy.

1012
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,980
I mean, that's the crunch, man.

1013
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:06,900
It's got to crunch.

1014
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,160
It's got to be it's got to be spiky.

1015
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,100
It's a crunch.

1016
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah, that's the real, that's how you know, that's how you
know, it's the legitimate Captain Crunch, not any imposter.

1017
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,260
Exactly, exactly.

1018
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,560

1071
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:09,660
It's a RPG city building mobile game and it's set in the
world of EarthBread where Cookie Heroes are set off on an

1072
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:17,340
epic adventure to stop the forces of evil which seems to be
this entire arc right now with the fifth anniversary.

1073
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:26,000
Yeah, they're celebrating their fifth anniversary which was
released on January 13th.

1074
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:33,380
I can't believe, I feel like I've heard about Cookie Run
Kingdom forever now like five years i'm like i thought this

1075
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:41,420
game is like so much older no offense but they had like we
had oven break which was the actual like the cookie run

1076
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:49,240
where you like where they run and stuff yeah yeah yeah um
but then cookie run kingdom i i personally and that was

1077
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:57,800
that's been going since like 2016 um so you probably have
her wow happy oh my gosh happy almost 10 years cookie run in

1078
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,760
that that is that's this year like 20.

1079
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,140
oh no wait a second oven break actually came out in 2009.

1080
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,940
no oh my god wait what what huh

1081
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:22,980
the original oven break oh it wasn't called cookie run at
that time it was called uh it was just oven break and it was

1082
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:33,820
2009 that's that means it's almost i'm not going to think
about this 20 years old well i well i didn't know about the

1083
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:40,900
whole thing but for quick cookie run kingdom it's the fifth
anniversary which is like i mean so many people now know

time to start playing yeah yeah i mean for veterans and new

1087
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:19,440
players alike i think everybody could get really into the
story so yeah for me personally cookie run kingdom was my

1088
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:26,460
very first cookie run got into it during pandemic and it was
like it made me so happy like you get so attached to them

1089
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:34,100
and I think I hope they have a super happy five-year
anniversary because they've they put they put a lot of love

1090
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:40,220
the developers put so much love into all the characters and
the game and you can tell they do like these directs that

1091
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:46,520
are kind of like you know like any other game directs and
stuff like that wait those are always so fun yeah they're

1092
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:54,320

wrap up the end of the the end of the year and look at look

1093
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:02,000
forward to like new new things that they're developing and
um and it's it's been it's really really cute it's really

1094
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:09,140
cute one of my favorite things about cookie run kingdom just
from a visual um perspective since you know i haven't played

1095
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:16,760
so much of it but it's just how detailed the like designs
can get like you wouldn't think that like a cookie could

1096
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:24,560
have like i know could have such like an intricate and like
all of them look so like unique and fun like it's just It's

1097
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,640
really, it's really awesome, I think.

1098
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,360
Exactly.

1099
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,640
There's, like we said earlier, like with Pokemon, there's a
cookie for everyone.

Hold on.

1127
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:20,760
What was it?

1128
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,720

1134
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,340
Run.

1135
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,520

I redeemed them not too long ago.

1140
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:53,560
OBS is rejecting me from being able to use the font.

1141
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,140
That's okay, though.

1142
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,160
It's okay.

1143
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,180
We carry on.

1144
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,420

We have Kingdom Star 2026 for your 555 EXP.

1148
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,660
And then also all of these.

01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,720
I'm just going to throw them at you.

1150
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:18,500

They're so generous.

1155
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:28,780
We'll do it in like a cool, dark, red outline.

1156
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,080
Cookie Run Codes.

1157
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,700
For you, everybody.

01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:34,800
To enjoy.

1159
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:35,560
For you.

1160
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,280
And you.

1161
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:36,880
And you.

1162
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:37,420
And you.

1163
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:37,980
And you.

1164
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,060
What is your favorite cookie then, Phoebe?

1165
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,700
And why do you like your cookie?

1166
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,080
Out of the cookie run cookies?

1167
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:47,320
Yes.

1168
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:48,880
Okay.

1169
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,820
I would say...

1170
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,240
Possibly Milky Way.

1171
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:03,960
cookie well actually no no no no i will say my favorite in
terms of cuteness milky way cookie is super duper cute she's

1172
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:10,680
a little train conductor and she's always sleepy she just
wants to sleep which is kind of bad i guess if you're in

1173
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:19,720
charge of a train but like uh well trains are they could be
they could just go themselves right like technology nowadays

1174
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:26,300
yeah i do also um oh yeah I'm sorry, keep going if you still
have more.

1175
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:32,660
Oh, she's really cute and she's a charged cookie, so she
just charges at you with her little train.

1176
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,740
And I love her so much.

1177
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,940
And she goes boo-boo or something like that.

1178
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,160
I use the Japanese voice pack, but she makes really cute
noises.

1179
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,180
Oh, that's so sweet.

1180
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:42,720
Aw.

1181
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:51,260
But I think, I think maybe in terms of like story and stuff,
Cotton Cookie's one of my favorites.

1182
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:59,360
She's voiced by Jorge Ayui in the Japanese version, helps
yeah baby oh my gosh wait so this game has like a stacked

1183
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:09,400
say you line up in japanese english japanese probably also
korean and chinese the the the voice actor lineup is stacked

1184
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:18,260
let's go it is so stacked it really is i've saw there's so
many cookies i guess it would like oh my gosh wait what if

1185
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:26,520

1186
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,300

1187
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:34,760
I would love to be a Cookie Run Kingdom.

1188
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:35,820
Hoorayayui.

1189
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,240
You can change the voice language.

1190
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:42,000
You can actually, like on this screen that we're on right
now, you can change it.

1191
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:50,760
So, but one thing we can go over is with the fifth
anniversary, they do have like some new gotcha characters

1192
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,300
that I want to show off a little bit to you guys.

1193
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,880
So the first one I want to show is the mold dough cookie.

1194
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,940
Which like...

1195
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:01,940
Wow!

1196
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,300
Look at...

1197
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:03,880
Whoa!

1198
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:05,700
Wow!

1199
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,660
I didn't think like...

1200
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:08,500
See, they're like...

1201
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,480
A moldy cookie.

1202
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,940
It would be so cool looking.

1203
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,720
I know, right?

1204
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,760
It's so cool!

1205
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:15,720
So cool!

1206
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,420
What is it?

1207
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,620
I wonder what the, like the little symbols say.

1208
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,320
I wonder.

1209
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,040
I know, right?

1210
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,960
What kind of language is this in?

1211
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,320
Cookie language.

1212
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,360
Cookie language.

1213
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,340
But he's pretty cool.

1214
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:37,580
And then we also have my personal favorite, which is the
Dark Enchantress cookie.

1215
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,100
Hello.

1216
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:41,620
Hello.

1217
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:42,360
Hello.

1218
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,220
Hi.

1219
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,080
Hello.

1220
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,280
Hello, Dark Enchantress.

1221
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:51,020
So this, like, this, this new Dark Enchantress cookie.

1222
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:51,460
Yeah.

1223
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,260
It's like, because we've seen her before.

1224
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,320
But, like, she's never looked this...

1225
01:12:59,340 --> 01:12:59,740
Evil?

1226
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:00,340
Cool?

1227
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:00,820
Awesome?

1228
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,780
And, and cool, cool.

1229
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,320
Like, like, like, I don't know, she was like an old lady
looking cookie before.

1230
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,520
Like, with the, like, Maleficent vibes.

1231
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,080
Right, right, right.

1232
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,760
But she's kind of like...

1233
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,560
She's kind of bad like this.

1234
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:13,380
Yeah!

1235
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:14,660
Yeah!

1236
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,340
This is definitely a look, like, the cool look.

1237
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,080
Mmm, very cool.

1238
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,720
And she's got, she is the...

1239
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,900
The bad guy.

1240
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,500
The prime bad guy in the whole Cookie Run Kingdom story.

1241
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,220
So imagine her on your team.

1242
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:32,580
Like this cookie.

1243
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:33,520
You know.

1244
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,620
Like this cookie's magic.

1245
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,240
All the evilness and everything on your team.

1246
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,880
You can have an evil team.

1247
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,280
You really could.

1248
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,820
I mean all that power, baby.

1249
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,700
But not only that.

1250
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,620
There are also two costumes.

1251
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,980
And I love costumes.

1252
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,520
They're very fun.

1253
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,440
Uh, one second.

1254
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,380
Bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, wait,
where'd they go?

1255
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,720
Oh, here we go.

1256
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,640
The costumes in this game were so peak.

1257
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,320
I know.

1258
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,940
Oh my gosh, I'm obsessed with the Eternal Sugar one.

1259
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,900
So we have Eternal Sugar and Shadow Milk.

1260
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,780
Da-da-da-da.

1261
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,520
They're both.

1262
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:18,360
And so, like, the thing with costumes in Cookie Run are that
they're, like, they're, uh...

1263
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:19,760

Kingdom as well.

1278
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,560
Like, I'm going to...

1279

Why does it look so good?

1280
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,180
Just make a TV series already.

1281
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:04,920
Make an anime.

1282
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,060
Okay, I'm going to quit the game real quick so we can hear
it without the...

1283
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,200
Without the BGM.

1284
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:13,980
And...

1285
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:14,180
Play!

1286
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:21,060
True masters never follow the script.

1287
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,480
I was like watching this earlier.

1288
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,340
I was like, oh, what a diva.

1289
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,220
puppet part came in, I was like, oh, sorry, I'm like talking
over it.

1290
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,200
But I was okay.

1291
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:33,380
When I'm on tape, there's no one else.

1292
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,320
But you!

1293
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:35,440
But you!

1294
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,650
Such a demon.

1295
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:45,190
I know.

1296
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,330
Oh, the foolish king.

1297
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,050
He always is.

1298
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,550
Trapped in a tragedy of his own making.

1299
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:57,270
Our show will go on forever and ever.

1300
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:58,370
So cute!

1301
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:59,630
So cute!

1302
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,910
So cute!

1303
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,650
Legendary costumes!

1304
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:08,850

01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:10,710
But me!

1306
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:17,870
Shadow Milk is very, very, very good.

1307
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,510
They're both, I think they're both in the meta right now
too.

1308
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:21,890
These two are Strunk.

1309
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,790
Strunk.

1310
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:24,270
Strunk.

1311
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:25,790
Let me pull up our ambience again.

1312
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,990
And they're just good characters.

1313
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:38,150
maybe the game will be kind to us and go out of maintenance
early oh please that would be nice that would be very kind

1314
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:46,590
it is sick though right like oh my gosh you wouldn't expect
it it's so awesome oh cookie i saw some people in chat

1315
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:52,790

it's about cookies but it's about more than the cookies it's

1316
01:17:52,790 --> 01:18:07,590
about it's about humanity self and it's about cool costumes
and fake effects and and boy bands there was a sorry this is

1317
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:16,890

They had a song and everything.

1321
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:32,990
Oh my gosh.

1322
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:33,470
Wait, that's so cute.

1323
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:34,450
And there was a rhythm game.

1324
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:35,530
Right?

1325
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:37,430
Oh my gosh.

1326
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:38,290
What the heck?

1327
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:39,890
That's so awesome.

1328
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:41,550
What's your...

1329
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,770
Like, did they have, like, a bunch of songs or just one?

1330
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:46,010
They had the one.

1331
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,430
I wish they came out with more.

1332
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:47,930
Ah.

1333
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:48,850
Um.

1334
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,410
But it was really cute.

1335
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:55,810
And one of the characters in Japanese is voiced by, uh, by,
uh, Kamiyan.

1336
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:56,450
Ah!

1337
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:57,610
You know, she kind of...

1338
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:05,010
Yeah, and I was like, okay, he's my he's my Yoshi, or he's
my bias and bad for his licorice cookie.

1339
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,370
That's so funny.

1340
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,030
They just do stuff.

1341
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:15,710
They had one year for April Fool's, they had a they had a
dating sim.

1342
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:20,070
Like a visual novel dating sim inside the game as well.

1343
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:27,550
And they were like animal, Bishonen and Bishojo versions of
several of the cookies.

1344
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:39,350
and that's just Cookie Run is so much more than just what
you think it is it is really good it sounds so good I love

1345
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:47,230
when they do when like Siri is kind of like when like
there's like spin-off things and like they like kind of they

1346
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:58,890

exactly exactly I think I think You'll love it so much,

1347
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,630
