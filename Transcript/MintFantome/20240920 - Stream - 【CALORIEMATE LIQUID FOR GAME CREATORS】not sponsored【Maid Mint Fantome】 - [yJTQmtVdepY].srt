1
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,520
So funky!

2
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,740
Thank you for the gift!

3
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
We just started?

4
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,600
Thank you!

5
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,260
Hello everybody!

6
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,620
Funky!

7
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,040
It's so yellow!

8
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,220
Hello!

9
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,280
Welcome to Calorie Mate Liquido!

10
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,810
I don't know what to expect of this at all.

11
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:57,990
Yay!

12
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,090
Okay, I have something to admit.

13
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,710
I might have said this before on stream.

14
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,790
I have tried... not Calorie Mate Liquid.

15
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,950
I don't even think I can have Calorie Mate Liquid.

16
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,610
Because I think it's carbonated.

17
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,510
So I don't even think I can have it.

18
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,130
But I tried the Calorie Mate...

19
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,610
So I've tried solids, right?

20
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,630
I've tried this Calorie Mate solid.

21
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,730
But I tried the Calorie Mate jelly.

22
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,090
And I tried the... what's it called?

23
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,470
Flavor.

24
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,650
If you ever have had Calorie Mate before...

25
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,070
It has like a distinct Calorie Mate flavor.

26
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:42,890
Like there's flavors.

27
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,230
Like there's like chocolate and cheese and maple.

28
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,830
And everything like that.

29
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,410
But I tried the jelly one.

30
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,870
And it was...

31
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,410
Yogurt.

32
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,650
Yogurt flavored.

33
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,490
And oh my god.

34
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,490
It's horrible.

35
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,410
Oh my god.

36
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,670
I thought...

37
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,670
I thought I was gonna throw up.

38
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,630
Just having it.

39
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,210
It's so bad.

40
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,590
Never have Calorie Mate jelly yogurt flavor.

41
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,630
Oh my god.

42
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,210
Because it tastes like regular Calorie Mate.

43
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,530
Which is like a biscuit.

44
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,410
Right?

45
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,050
And...

46
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,810
There goes my sponsorship.

47
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,470
But I've never had the Calorie Mate liquid before.

48
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,430
Maybe it's okay.

49
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,670
Maybe it's good.

50
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,930
Who knows?

51
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,730
Oh god.

52
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,590
It's just so gross.

53
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,770
It's so bad.

54
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,110
Maybe the other flavors are better.

55
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,330
But the yogurt one...

56
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,170
Oh my gosh.

57
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,170
It was just...

58
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,430
And then the consistency of the jelly.

59
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,430
It's so gross.

60
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,510
So...

61
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,190
Don't have it.

62
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,850
They're all really gross.

63
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,750
O'Brien says they're all gross.

64
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,550
All the jelly ones?

65
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,590
Now, if you ever want to try Calorie Mate the biscuit...

66
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,610
It's pretty good.

67
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,250
It's actually quite tasty for something if you need.

68
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,630
I especially like that the Calorie Mate biscuits have like...

69
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,310
Little...

70
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,990
Little like...

71
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,670
Piece chunks in them.

72
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,150
It's pretty good.

73
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,030
The biscuits are good.

74
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,130
But don't have the jellies.

75
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,230
Now for the liquids?

76
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:31,990
I don't know.

77
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,070
Never even heard of them.

78
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,730
Calorie Mate?

79
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,930
Oh my gosh.

80
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,710
Calorie Mate...

81
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,650
Saved me...

82
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,150
When I went to an idol show one time.

83
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,790
Because...

84
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,250
Essentially...

85
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,030
My favorite group was at the end of the day.

86
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,370
And I got there at the beginning of the day.

87
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,970
So I waited...

88
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,490
Like six or seven hours...

89
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,390
Trying to get to the front row...

90
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,730
Of my favorite group.

91
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,950
And so...

92
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,590
Hi, Minto.

93
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,990
Hello.

94
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,830
Hello, hello.

95
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,850
And so...

96
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,510
Throughout the day...

97
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,390
I would...

98
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,630
Like kind of like...

99
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,830
Squat in the theater.

100
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,310
And I would just like...

101
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,530
Eat Calorie Mate.

102
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,050
And then I would stand up...

103
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,470
And I would cheer for more idols.

104
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,670
And then I would squat...

105
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,750
And eat more Calorie Mate.

106
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,330
So...

107
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,450
Yeah...

108
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,130
Calorie Mate is great for events like that.

109
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,070
You know?

110
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,550
Just like Naked Snake.

111
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,170
I know.

112
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,110
I know.

113
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,490
I probably look just like him.

114
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,430
I bet there were some people that were like...

115
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,890
Oh my gosh.

116
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,070
That...

117
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,610
That ghost over there?

118
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,430
Well, as long as they have a sixth sense.

119
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:41,730
You know?

120
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,330
They would have to...

121
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,990
They probably were just like...

122
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,730
I am sensing someone...

123
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,630
Reenacting...

124
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,030
Metal Gear Solid 3.

125
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,850
At this moment.

126
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,790
Imagining Minto and a survival viewer...

127
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,490
Reviewing each of the flavors...

128
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,330
Was pretty tasty.

129
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,110
And this is horrible.

130
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,270
Wait.

131
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,150
This is an actual game?

132
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,510
Yes!

133
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,170
This is an actual game?

134
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,090
I'm shocked.

135
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,410
I'm shocked.

136
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,650
There is no like...

137
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,530
You know how...

138
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,330
There is no like...

139
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:10,750
TM.

140
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,030
Trademark or...

141
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,230
Trademarks exist in Japan, right?

142
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,670
There is no like...

143
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,650
Copyright.

144
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,250
Anything here.

145
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,570
It even has trophies apparently.

146
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,170
Jumping Professional.

147
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,970
Try touching the balloon.

148
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,810
I guess you'll know what this means when the time comes.

149
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,410
So, you know...

150
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,890
It won't let me look at any other trophies.

151
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:40,910
That's it.

152
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,010
This is the one.

153
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,750
Balloons?

154
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,750
Stop.

155
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,370
Stop.

156
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,350
Yeah, but you don't have to touch the balloon.

157
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,810
We just have to try and do it.

158
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,950
Good job, Voss, on the many streams.

159
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,170
Calorie legend.

160
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,590
Thank you.

161
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,270
Ice monkey.

162
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,030
I want to play balloons.

163
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,310
No, but we're here for Calorie Mate.

164
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,610
Oh my gosh, my eyes.

165
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,030
So, a few other things.

166
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:23,810
Yes, I do know that if you play in Nihongo, that the Japanese voice is Akio Otsuka.

167
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,430
A.K.A.

168
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,250
the Japanese voice of Snake.

169
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,670
But...

170
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,690
I decided...

171
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,870
Yoshi, happy birthday!

172
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,910
Happy birthday to you.

173
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,630
Happy birthday to you.

174
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,330
Happy birthday, dear Yoshi.

175
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,310
Happy birthday to you.

176
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,270
Happy birthday!

177
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,450
I'm going to turn down the volume just a little bit more.

178
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,000
It's so loud.

179
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,860
Maybe like that.

180
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,220
Okay.

181
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,100
Um...

182
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,580
But, uh...

183
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,180
What was I saying?

184
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,200
I decided I'll play it in English.

185
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
Because I kind of want to know what's going on.

186
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,500
And I don't want to have to...

187
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,460
If there's anything that I, you know...

188
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,940
I'm not...

189
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm not so Nihongo-Jozu, you guys.

190
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,640
So I wouldn't be able to translate everything.

191
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,740
And...

192
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,660
So I wouldn't be able to explain everything.

193
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
And, you know...

194
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,360
All that.

195
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
And my head is empty.

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,900
So...

197
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,360
Japan language, please.

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,860
If you went to play Calorie Mate Liquid for yourself, it's free on Steam.

199
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,740
Thank you for waiting!

200
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,240
Thanks, Cheki!

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,820
Thank you for the donation!

202
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,920
It's not sponsored, but you can play it and if you want to hear...

203
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,620
Otsuka Akio-sama, in all his snake glory.

204
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,780
And it's really great because he says, And I'm like, you can't have him just saying like that!

205
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,860
You can't just have Solid Snake saying liquid.

206
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,500
But, to counteract the fact that probably it's not David Hayter...

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,480
voicing the guy in this Calorie Mate game, which seems like an absolute travesty.

208
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,320
Just seems like a real...

209
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,800
What's the word?

210
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,680
A real blunder on their part.

211
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,200
I instead have got this.

212
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:35,960
Hey!

213
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,020
Oh my god!

214
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
It's really loud.

215
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,260
Hi, Snake!

216
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,620
How are you doing?

217
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm good!

218
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
How are you?

219
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,740
Are you there?

220
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,300
Yeah!

221
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm here!

222
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,800
Who are you?

223
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,180
Oh!

224
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,420
I'm Minto!

225
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,360
Um...

226
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, I brought you here.

227
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,980
I brought you here, Snake, to be able to do the...

228
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,620
What are you doing here?

229
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,160
This is my channel.

230
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,280
I brought you here to...

231
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,560
Does the name Deep Throat mean anything to you?

232
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,170
Don't answer that.

233
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,110
This is Snake.

234
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,710
So, I have this to help us...

235
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,370
Um...

236
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,110
Uh...

237
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,490
Instead, we can use this...

238
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,150
Uh...

239
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,250
To counter...

240
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,650
Counter the person that might be doing the narration in this game instead!

241
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,650
Yippee!

242
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,790
Yes.

243
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,490
Yes!

244
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,910
Yeah.

245
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,450
Yeah!

246
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,930
Okay, but what's so funny about this soundboard...

247
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,290
Is I don't know why there's so many...

248
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,910
So many options about him being lonely.

249
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:58,770
Like...

250
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,570
I'm feeling lonely.

251
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,830
Oh my god.

252
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,730
I'm lonely.

253
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,950
I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.

254
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,230
I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.

255
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,740
Why are there so many things about him being lonely?

256
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,380
I don't understand.

257
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,540
You are so cooked.

258
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,820
I discovered this like...

259
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,080
Just earlier, right before stream.

260
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,680
And I bet you can guess what I've been doing...

261
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,560
I've just been like... pressing all of them, you know?

262
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,560
There was another one.

263
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,000
Hold on.

264
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,620
I think it was... oh, wait.

265
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,840
Where is the corpses?

266
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,780
Oh, here we go.

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,580

268
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,040

269
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,140

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,580
He's dead.

296
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,000
Now he's dead too.

297
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,680
Fox is dead.

298
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,800

299
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,220
Now he's dead too.

300
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,200
Mint original song.

301
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,940
Okay, okay.

302
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,120

303
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,100
So, yes, we'll have fun with it.

304
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,720
We'll be silly goofy as we always are.

305
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,700
Let's start.

306
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,500
Balanced food.

307
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,560
Sorry.

308
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,880
Sorry.

309
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,960
I had an empty cup.

310
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,940
And I just knocked it off my desk from waving my hands around.

311
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,920
Sorry.

312
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,580
Sorry.

313
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,700

314
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,580
Okay.

315
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,580

00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,400
Oh god.

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,660
No.

328
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:56,960
See.

329
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,860
Don't drink this.

330
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,520
Don't drink this.

331
00:15:59,520 --> 00:15:59,980
It's so bad.

332
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,300
Use code BOOMER for 20% off.

333
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,140
Oh yeah.

334
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,120

337
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,780
Wait.

338
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,100
They don't have...

339
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,240

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,340
I'm liquid.

343
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,280
Calorie mate liquid cafe au lait flavor.

344
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,520
Wait.

345
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:23,980
I got this.

346
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,440
I got this.

347
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:24,840
I got this.

348
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,120
Hold on.

349
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,120
I've got this.

350
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,940
Liquid snake.

351
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm liquid.

352
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,740
Calorie mate liquid fruit mix flavor.

353
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,940
It's so loud.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,680
Liquid snake.

355
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,200
Actually, hold on.

356
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,860
I'm gonna do this instead so I can...

357
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,240
Sorry.

358
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm trying to adjust audio stuff.

359
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,980
This should be good.

360
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,800
This should be good, I think.

361
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,180
Sorry.

362
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,100
Okay.

363
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,420
I'm liquid.

364
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,080
Calorie mate liquid fruit mix flavor.

365
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,360
Liquid snake.

366
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,380
It's still so loud.

367
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
This is snake.

368
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,140
It's so loud.

369
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,940
Kind of sounds like liquid.

370
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Just a little bit.

371
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,620
I don't know.

372
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,540
This is snake.

373
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,620
Let's do my least favorite.

374
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,000
Calorie mate liquid yogurt flavor.

375
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,700
Liquid in all caps too.

376
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,560
How do I... hold on.

377
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,880
Okay.

378
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,280
Start.

379
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,400
Let's start the game.

380
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,240
Got it.

381
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,760
Sorry.

382
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm so obnoxious.

383
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,420
I'm so sorry.

384
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,660
Okay.

385
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,800
Time for a little pre-mission exercise.

386
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,140
Why is there a heartbeat?

387
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,880
And here we go.

388
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,340
What?

389
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:49,700
Wait.

390
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
I didn't even get to read the instructions.

391
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,180
It was so fast.

392
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,960
Wait, wait, wait.

393
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,840
What's the controls?

394
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,940
Wait, wait, wait.

395
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,180
According to data, the target game creator is two months away from launch.

396
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,480
And has a lot to do every day.

397
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,420
Okay.

398
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,120
Okay.

399
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,840
What is this?

400
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,540
Oh.

401
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,440
The mission is to deliver well-balanced nutrition to the game creator.

402
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,280
No way there's a mission.

403
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,240
Colonel!

404
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,780
According to data, the target creator tends to eat irregularly due to being engrossed in game development.

405
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,340
Oh.

406
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,900
When thinking, nutrition is essential.

407
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,080
Oh my god.

408
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,620
There he is.

409
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,540
That's where Calorie Mate Liquid comes into play.

410
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,800
Why is his room so cute?

411
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,280
Additionally, this mission is crucial towards successful game development.

412
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,260
Game development.

413
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,440
Commencing virtuous mission.

414
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,920
Let's reach the target while staying chilled.

415
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,520
Oh.

416
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,440
We gotta stay chilled.

417
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:51,940
Okay.

418
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,220
Oh.

419
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,120
He's waiting.

420
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,980
He's...

421
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,560
Oh.

422
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:54,940
Okay.

423
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,840
I have to... Oh no.

424
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,760
My chillness is...

425
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,060
You guys are kind of blocking it.

426
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,300
Hold on.

427
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,480
Oh.

428
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,160
Hold on.

429
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,480
Let me...

430
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,640
Let me move you guys down just a bit.

431
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,350
I'll put you like that.

432
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,530
That should be good.

433
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,730
Now you guys can see how chill we are.

434
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,490
You guys can see how cool and how chill we are.

435
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,030
So how do I play this game?

436
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,670
Okay.

437
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,110
Hold on.

438
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,330
What are these?

439
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,370
I see.

440
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,030
A backlog of plastic models.

441
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,610
It's not like that, Mom.

442
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,750
What does that mean?

443
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,870
Whoa.

444
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:32,690
Whoa.

445
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,390
Why does it move so ominously?

446
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,270
Plastic models.

447
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,970
There's information that the target game created that giant creature.

448
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,210
It's strangely endearing to look at.

449
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,490
What is this feeling?

450
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,930
Whoa.

451
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,390
Oh.

452
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:52,910
Ow.

453
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,970
This is bad.

454
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,610
Oh my god.

455
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,910
We have health.

456
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,370
Oh my god.

457
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,350
We have health, you guys.

458
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,610
Hold on.

459
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,110
What's this?

460
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,810
At the very least, have a liquid first thing so you can last all morning.

461
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,610
Everybody have a liquid in the morning so you can last, okay?

462
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,010
I think we got to knock this over, right?

463
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,650
Probably.

464
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,690
Wait.

465
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,210
I'm clipping through the walls.

466
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,570
Oh god.

467
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,930
Oh shoot.

468
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,130
Um.

469
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:41,610
Ah!

470
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,790
Why does it sound like it's so ominous?

471
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,310
Top of the table?

472
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,790
You think it's up there instead?

473
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,910
How do I get up there?

474
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,530
I'm just a can.

475
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,090
Oh my gosh.

476
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,790
Oh my gosh.

477
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,190
The camera.

478
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,830
Oh my god.

479
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,010
Oh my god.

480
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,510
We're at 7 degrees Celsius.

481
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,330
Oh.

482
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,270
This isn't going to be chilled at all.

483
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,370
Cat.

484
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,690
You have food.

485
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,470
This is true cat behavior.

486
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,150
You have food.

487
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,250
Oh wait.

488
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:31,650
I see it.

489
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:31,970
I see it.

490
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:32,450
Huh.

491
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,490
Huh.

492
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,370
Huh.

493
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,670
Huh.

494
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,210
Huh.

495
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,210
Oh, a VR headset, huh?

496
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,150
According to data, they've become much lighter in recent years.

497
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,690
This guy, all he's got is calories.

498
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,930
Oh, yogurt flavor.

499
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,050
How are you?

500
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,790
I want to hear.

501
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,530
I want to hear Akio Otsuka say all this.

502
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,830
Oh, is that cafe au lait flavor?

503
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,950
How are you doing?

504
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,430
Why?

505
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,170
Is that cafe au lait flavor?

506
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,290
What else is on here?

507
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,130
Can I chill myself out?

508
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,950
Can I become cool?

509
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,710
Chill.

510
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,170
I'm chill.

511
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,770
I'm chill.

512
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,930
I'm chill.

513
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,530
Like, put me under the water.

514
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,010
Um.

515
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,690
I went on the stove.

516
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,210
No.

517
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,730
Oh wait.

518
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,270
Maybe...

519
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,810
Oh.

520
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,870
I keep wanting to go faster with it.

521
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,510
What's wrong?

522
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,330
It's a ball.

523
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,270
It's a little play ball.

524
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,470
It's okay cat.

525
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,420
Only cats.

526
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,820
Hands.

527
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:46,940
What?

528
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,720
Oh, wait.

529
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,280
Oh, okay.

530
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,520
Okay.

531
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:48,780
I see.

532
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:48,980
I see.

533
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,140
Nice.

534
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,020
What's up there?

535
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,080
His cosplay.

536
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,500
Oh my gosh.

537
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,180
What's wrong?

538
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,380
Oh no.

539
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,100
He is getting isekai?

540
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,820
What's happening?

541
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,040
Super Chanto time.

542
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,740
Oh.

543
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,800
Think about it.

544
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,880
I've heard of this.

545
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,640
You have?

546
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:24,920
When a game creator's work immersion reaches its limit, the data they're working on can break the fourth wall and invade reality from their computer.

547
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,500
Is that a bug?

548
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,160
I see.

549
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,480
They're swamped with a massive number of bug reports.

550
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,440
Oh, sorry.

551
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,240
Oh, what did I say?

552
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,100
Defeat the bugs.

553
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,940
Oh.

554
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,400
Eliminate the S-Bugs.

555
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,120
Oh my god.

556
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,740
The bugs are delusions, but actual data can be displayed in augmented manner.

557
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,460
Oh, I can't see.

558
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,540
If we eliminate them, the bugs inside the computer should disappear.

559
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,800
I won't give up.

560
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,600
I'm nice and dry, but it's a little hard to move.

561
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,900
You're too loud, Snake.

562
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,940
I give up trying to use you.

563
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,380
Oh, it's my eyes.

564
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,600
My ga - ugh, it's my- my eyes.

565
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay.

566
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,760
Time for a little pre-mission exercise.

567
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,160
Okay.

568
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Camera.

569
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,420
Space.

570
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,020
Okay.

571
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,860
Easy.

572
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,240
Okay.

573
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,220
And here we go.

574
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,700
All right.

575
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,420
I knew everything.

576
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,440
I already knew everything.

577
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:23,860
Okay.

578
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,680
The mission is to deliver win- Yeah, yeah.

579
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,400
I know the mission.

580
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:27,980
I know the mission.

581
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,660
So it said we have to defeat the S-Bug, but some of those said, like, A... B...

582
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,000
You think it's timed?

583
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,960
If I'm so chilled, do you think the bug will still happen?

584
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,940
Oh my god!

585
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,200
A bug!

586
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,640
How do I destroy it?

587
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,820
How do I do that?

588
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,220
I'm just a can!

589
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,800
Oh!

590
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,430
I'm too good at this.

591
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,490
I'm too good at this game.

592
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,770
Ouch!

593
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,310
I think I lost health a little bit.

594
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,390
Oh, I'm getting too excited.

595
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,650
I'm just a can, please!

596
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,990
This dialogue.

597
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,070
Please.

598
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,830
Am I doing it?

599
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,150
Am I defeating the monster?

600
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,510
Am I doing it, you guys?

601
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,790
I can't tell!

602
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,830
Don't interrupt the mission!

603
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,630
Am I doing it?

604
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,890
Oh wait, that looks like health.

605
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,080
Yeah!

606
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,380
Oh, I'm stuck.

607
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,400
Ouch!

608
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,700
Oh, okay.

609
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,240
Narrator.

610
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,880
Maybe I need to attack it.

611
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,900
I think so, but I'm just not sure.

612
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,820
Right now, I'm just kinda collecting coins and health and stuff.

613
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,260
Oh my gosh.

614
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,780
Okay.

615
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,180
How do I get up there even?

616
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,460
Ugh!

617
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,340
Not yet!

618
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:43,740
Ugh!

619
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,940
Defeating these is enough.

620
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,980
They don't even come after me.

621
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
They just kind of like exist.

622
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,800
They're even bumping into each other.

623
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,060
They're so stupid.

624
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,720
What's happening?

625
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,860
Oh my god!

626
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,720
Oh my god!

627
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,840
Okay, how do I get up there?

628
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,360
Maybe... maybe like through the pillow?

629
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Feels like their sleeping posture is quite poor.

630
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,820
Quite poor.

631
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,560
You guys...

632
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,080
Oh, I did it.

633
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:34,940
Okay.

634
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,060
Nice, nice.

635
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,380
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

636
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,660
I'm trying, I'm trying.

637
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,920
Can you not go to the bed?

638
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm trying!

639
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,840
Okay, hold on.

640
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,580
If I get enough momentum, I can maybe go up the blanket.

641
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,520
Oh my god.

642
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,750
Do something!

643
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,330
I can't even get up the...

644
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,250
Oh my gosh.

645
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,120
Oh, there you go.

646
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,500
I can't even get up the bed.

647
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,940
No, no!

648
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,420
Oh, that was close.

649
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,040
Okay, hold on.

650
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,700
I think if I... here?

651
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,920
Like this?

652
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,640
And then... no!

653
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,880
Oh no, no, no!

654
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,660
Okay, okay.

655
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,300
Okay,

656
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,090
okay, okay.

657
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,250
You assholes!

658
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,750
All of you!

659
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,470
Oh my god.

660
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,410
Don't interrupt the mission!

661
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:42,770
Stop!

662
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,490
Please!

663
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:43,750
Oops.

664
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,350
I got a bit too excited.

665
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:45,870
Please.

666
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,250
Oh my god!

667
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,710
Oh my god!

668
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,090
There's so many of them!

669
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,770
Why are they up there?

670
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,450
Okay.

671
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,210
Hold on.

672
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,930
Oh my god.

673
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:02,850
Oh, please.

674
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,370
I'm stuck in here.

675
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,600
The Dark Souls.

676
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,140
I need a calorie-based liquido!

677
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,640
Oh my god, please.

678
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,240
Don't come here!

679
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,620
Don't come here!

680
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,020
Okay, okay.

681
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,180
Okay.

682
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,460
I should have rolled instead of jump-jumped.

683
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,140
I should have rolled.

684
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,780
Oh my gosh.

685
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,500
Okay, you guys.

686
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,000
We got this.

687
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,960
Calorie Souls.

688
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,740
I might need to get more health though.

689
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:45,780
Oh.

690
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,920
I won't give up.

691
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,840
Oh my god.

692
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,120
Oh my god.

693
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,420
Okay.

694
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,240
Time for a little pre-mission exercise.

695
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,920
Get me out of here.

696
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,540
Get me out of here.

697
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,040
Get me out of here.

698
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,580
I'm ready.

699
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,640
And here we go.

700
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:06,940
Yeah!

701
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,700
Here we go!

702
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,180
I'm ready.

703
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,740
I'm ready for the mission.

704
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,540
See, I thought I was supposed to like...

705
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,220
feed the cat... to... you know...

706
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,920
Okay.

707
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,920
According to all known lies of aviation.

708
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
It has a lot to do every day.

709
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,760
Okay, here we go.

710
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,120
Alright, we know what to do, guys.

711
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,640
We know what to do.

712
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,260
Angel!

713
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,180
Thanks for the gift, dude!

714
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,100
Eliminate the S-Bugs!

715
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,140
Eliminate the S-Bugs.

716
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,220
The bugs are delusions, but actual data being displayed in an augmented manner.

717
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,440
If we eliminate them...

718
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,940
Oh, no, no, no, no!

719
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,560
Out!

720
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,480
Why can't I, like, Mario them?

721
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,760
Oh, my gosh.

722
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,780
Oh, okay.

723
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,980
Oh, that was so close!

724
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,640
I can't see!

725
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,400
I can't see!

726
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,960
I can't see, please.

727
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Okay.

728
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,220
Okay.

729
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,600
Quite impressive, isn't it?

730
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,160
Thank you.

731
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,320
I am quite impressive.

732
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,680
Oh, God.

733
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,080
Please, please, let me move, let me move.

734
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,920
There's more?

735
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,700
We still got S-Bugs?

736
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,580
Where?

737
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,060
Where?

738
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,380
We do?

739
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,580
Oh, okay.

740
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,220
And he's now doing stuff down there.

741
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,340
Okay.

742
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,800
Why are there so many bugs in this tiny room and I can't see anything?

743
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,040
There are still some S-Bugs left.

744
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,440
I'll support the creator's debugging work.

745
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,980
Okay.

746
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,200
Can you come down here?

747
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,260
How do I get up there?

748
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,780
No.

749
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,100
What?

750
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,200
This is so messed up.

751
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,740
Please.

752
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,800
Not yet.

753
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,320
No, don't hit me.

754
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,640
Don't hit me.

755
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,640
What's my hitbox?

756
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,440
I'm just a can.

757
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,580
Don't interrupt the mission.

758
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:05,940
What?

759
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:06,780
Oops.

760
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,460
I got a bit too excited.

761
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,480
Okay.

762
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,500
I'm trying to get rid of them.

763
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,780
How am I supposed to get up there?

764
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,140
This is bad.

765
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,100
This is bad.

766
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,460
This is bad, man.

767
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,580
This is actually bad.

768
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,740
Yeah.

769
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,120
There we go.

770
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,860
Please.

771
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,420
Please.

772
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,120
Box.

773
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,540
No.

774
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,840
Don't be stuck now.

775
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,020
Box.

776
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,380
No.

777
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,320
Okay.

778
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,100
No.

779
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,100
Oh, my God.

780
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,300
No.

781
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:37,940
Oh,

782
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,330
I can't push it.

783
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,790
Oh, my God.

784
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,830
Where'd the box go?

785
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,070
Wait.

786
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,150
Wait.

787
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,450
Where'd the...

788
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,090
Oh, my God.

789
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:49,570
No.

790
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,170
This is so bad.

791
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,590
How am I supposed to climb up there?

792
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,050
If I have no box?

793
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,970
What am I supposed to do?

794
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,630
He has steps?

795
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,850
I guess so.

796
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,290
Okay.

797
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,500
We're making our way up.

798
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,220
Oh, I'm getting hurt, I think.

799
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,240
Oh, I am...

800
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,300
I am getting hurt every time.

801
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,510
Yeah!

802
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,270
I am a gamer!

803
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,570
This game is for gamers only!

804
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,350
Did we manage to eliminate them all?

805
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,710
It seems the bugs have been removed.

806
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,590
Give me... all my treasure.

807
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,710
What does...

808
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,690
There's information that the target game creator tried to work through their backlog of games after yesterday's work.

809
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:53,850
No!

810
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:53,850
This is going to disappear!

811
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,590
No, I earned these!

812
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:01,370
They got into their work and stayed up late and skipped breakfast today as a result.

813
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,010
No!

814
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,250
My coins!

815
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,710
Okay, how am I supposed to get up here now, game?

816
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,030
Okay, tell me this.

817
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,410
You've destroyed all of the boxes.

818
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,950
How am I supposed to get up here?

819
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,830
How am I supposed to...

820
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,990
At the very least, have a liquid first thing so you can last all morning.

821
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,490
Shut up!

822
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,570
Jump at the end?

823
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,470
Oh, let's try it.

824
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,340
We did it!

825
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,120
He's a gamer.

826
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,160
Sometimes lunch ends up being late.

827
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,440
Oh, another cat.

828
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:46,960
Okay.

829
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,800
What do we do with this guy?

830
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,500
Oh, I think I have to parkour?

831
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:54,820
Okay.

832
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,880
It's hot here.

833
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,440
I'd like a splash of water, but...

834
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,680
I'll bear it.

835
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,640
Let's get the game creator nourished quickly.

836
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,800
You're... you... why don't you just drink your... self?

837
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,600
You are literally the hydration, are you not?

838
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,920
How are you thirsty?

839
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:20,820
If you drink me, you can replenish the five essential nutrients your body needs in a well-balanced manner.

840
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,940
What do you mean by that, gallery mate?

841
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:32,980
You're... you... why don't you just drink your... self?

842
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,880
I see.

843
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,400
I see.

844
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,300
You don't like the idea to drink juice, do you?

845
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,020
Yeah, but...

846
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,360
You know, I think you are the one who I want to be with.

847
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,380
I want to be with.

848
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,940
I'm totally down with you.

849
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,300
Oh, wait.

850
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,960
Oh, wait.

851
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,400
Oh, wait.

852
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,260
You can drink some juice along with it.

853
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm here.

854
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,780
I'm game creator!

855
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,580
I'm here!

856
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,040
Yeah... and?

857
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,100
Mmm...

858
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,640
Oh yeah.

859
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,460
Oh yeah.

860
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,940
Okay.

861
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,360
Oh my gosh, you guys hand-holding!

862
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,440
The creator's room...

863
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,940
Sounds kind of ominous though, right?

864
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,520
Let's aim for their palm.

865
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,400
How?

866
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:23,760
Oh!

867
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,800
No!

868
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,240
No!

869
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,580
No!

870
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,440
Oh wait, this is just part 4.

871
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,580
Join the idol club!

872
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,480
Oh my god, let the guy have hop!

873
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,240
What?

874
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,560
This chart!

875
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,020
It's too chaotic!

876
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Are they trying to create an action RPG where school idols thrive in a dark fantasy world?

877
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,540
Looks like things have gotten quite mixed up.

878
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,160
What?

879
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,520
Okay.

880
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,460
Oh.

881
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,240
Okay.

882
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,280
Start.

883
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,820
The turmoil of youth!

884
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,000
Ouch!

885
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,440
Ouch!

886
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:15,980
Oh no.

887
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,520
If I die, I probably have to start over at the very beginning, I imagine.

888
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,780
Thank you!

889
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,560
Wait, this kind of slaps.

890
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,120
Join the magic club!

891
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,620
Practice wizardry!

892
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,420
Oh no.

893
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:38,960
Oh!

894
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,000
This is bad!

895
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,180
This is bad!

896
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,960
Okay, just kidding.

897
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,360
Actual Miku.

898
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,080
Okay, let's join the idol club instead!

899
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,840
Oh, come on!

900
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,510
This is kind of awesome, not gonna lie.

901
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,550
Don't interrupt the mission!

902
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,830
Oops.

903
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,450
I got a bit too excited.

904
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,590
You guys, I can't die.

905
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,150
I can't die.

906
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,810
I can't die.

907
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,210
Okay.

908
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,230
Join the idol club!

909
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,440
Will the idol club be discontinued?

910
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,480
Team development is teamwork.

911
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,240
Oh, here he comes.

912
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,600
Here he comes.

913
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:21,720
Okay, okay.

914
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,760
If anyone is missing, the team can't perform at its best.

915
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,800
This is so...

916
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,420
Just like the five essential nutrients.

917
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,940
This is too much.

918
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,660
Just like the five essential nutrients.

919
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,360
Okay.

920
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,280
Idol club.

921
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,720
Idol club.

922
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,880
Go to an audition!

923
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,640
Ah!

924
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,720
Ah!

925
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,020
It's mine!

926
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,240
Huh?

927
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,420
The flowchart has changed!

928
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,060
Oh!

929
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,600
Simple gear?

930
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,840
What is happening?

931
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,600
This is kind of awesome!

932
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,820
Um...

933
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,420
Yay!

934
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:57,900
Yay!

935
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,540
In fact, one of the origins of Calorie Mate is space food.

936
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,440
It is?

937
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,680
For more details, check the Calorie Mate website.

938
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,480
Oh my gosh.

939
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,360
This is too much.

940
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,620
Check the website.

941
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,220
I'm surviving.

942
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,620
I'm fighting for my life out here, Calorie Mate.

943
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,660
I'm at 13 degrees Celsius.

944
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,180
I'm getting warm, warm, warm.

945
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,740
I'm not a chilled beverage anymore.

946
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,020
Oh!

947
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,500
That was close.

948
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:32,880
That was close.

949
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,260
Arrive at the Flame Fort.

950
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,000
Guys, I don't know about this.

951
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,240
Yes!

952
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,640
Yes!

953
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,000
Yes!

954
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,840
Go Liquid!

955
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,880
Go Liquid!

956
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,420
Go!

957
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,380
Oh my gosh!

958
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,580
What is going on?

959
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,940
I have to survive all of this!

960
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,360
Not yet.

961
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,380
Not yet.

962
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,740
What do you mean, not yet?

963
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,700
Am I getting hurt?

964
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,300
Is that hurting me?

965
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,860
To elevate your daily nutritional levels, Calorie Mate Liquid is ideal.

966
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,400
Calorie Mate is stressing me out.

967
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,720
Don't interrupt the mission.

968
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,860
Oops.

969
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,620
I got a bit too excited.

970
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,100
I'm so excited.

971
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,240
What?

972
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,000
There's enemies down here now.

973
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:26,980
No.

974
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,340
Oh, there's health enemies.

975
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:28,860
Okay.

976
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,940
Don't interrupt the mission.

977
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,500
They shouldn't be able to hurt you.

978
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:32,720
Oops.

979
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,920
I got a bit too excited.

980
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,880
Oh my god.

981
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,660
No way.

982
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,300
They hurt you.

983
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,400
Oh my god.

984
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,120
No, no, no, no.

985
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,160
Leave me alone.

986
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,820
Leave me alone.

987
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,260
Ah!

988
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,500
I can't even see anything.

989
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,680
Please.

990
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,620
I'm gonna die.

991
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,220
I'm gonna die.

992
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,110
Don't bother me.

993
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,250
Don't be at the very beginning, please.

994
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:04,570
Please.

995
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,410
Don't be at the very...

996
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:05,590
Okay.

997
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,910
Time for a little pre-mission exercise.

998
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,190
And here we go.

999
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,230
You go.

1000
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,150
You go.

1001
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,290
I wanna go back in here.

1002
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,770
You go instead.

1003
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:23,850
Please.

1004
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:24,990
What?

1005
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,030
How am I getting hotter with the fridge?

1006
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,990
I'm in the fridge.

1007
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,510
Oh, no.

1008
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,630
I'm gonna die.

1009
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,550
This game is brutal.

1010
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,110
What the hell?

1011
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,730
They were like, yeah, only gamers can play this game for real.

1012
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,150
What the hell?

1013
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,610
Oh my gosh.

1014
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,170
Apples and Bananas.

1015
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,050
I don't want to do this again.

1016
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,990
Oh my god.

1017
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,650
Eliminate the S-Bugs.

1018
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,030
The bugs are delusions, but actual data being displayed in an augmented manner.

1019
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,970
Oh wait, I'm an idiot.

1020
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:09,490
Sorry.

1021
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:15,270
If we eliminate them, the bugs inside the computer should disappear too.

1022
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,450
Okay.

1023
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,080
Does it hit here?

1024
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
I don't think so.

1025
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,340
Oh yes, it does.

1026
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,540
Oh yes, it does.

1027
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,540
This is bad.

1028
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,870
You guys!

1029
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,430
I didn't think that this was going to be a Rage game.

1030
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:49,950
No!

1031
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,610
I lost my box.

1032
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,390
Are you kidding me?

1033
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,510
Are you kidding me?

1034
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,570
What is...

1035
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,300
Okay.

1036
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,180
All right.

1037
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,120
To the... Oh my gosh.

1038
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,720
To the bench.

1039
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,500
To the bench.

1040
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,800
To the... Oh, that was close.

1041
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,800
To the bench!

1042
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,540
Please!

1043
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,560
Don't interrupt the mission!

1044
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,720
Oops.

1045
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,460
I've been a bit too excited.

1046
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,240
Please!

1047
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,420
Oh my gosh.

1048
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,380
Okay.

1049
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,200
We still got S-Bugs?

1050
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,360
Oh.

1051
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,480
Okay.

1052
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,980
Okay, okay, okay.

1053
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,540
Maybe I can get him from down here.

1054
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,540
I'm a gamer.

1055
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:45,900
I'm a gamer.

1056
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,320
I'm a gamer.

1057
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:46,680
I'm a gamer.

1058
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,620
There are still some S-Bugs left.

1059
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,020
I'll support the creator's debugging work.

1060
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,040
Oh, wait.

1061
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,500
But I have to...

1062
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,280
Wait.

1063
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,040
But I have... I get hurt when I go up him.

1064
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,240
Oh, no.

1065
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,660
Minto gaming.

1066
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,220
Minto gaming.

1067
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,320
Okay.

1068
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,380
I don't get hurt on these ones, though.

1069
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,120
Oh my gosh.

1070
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,420
Okay.

1071
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,680
Okay.

1072
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,340
Okay.

1073
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,320
Don't interrupt the mission!

1074
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,420
Don't interrupt him!

1075
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:24,820
Oops.

1076
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,280
I got a bit too excited.

1077
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,340
Don't interrupt the mission!

1078
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:28,880
Oh my god.

1079
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,160
Oh my god.

1080
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,280
Oh my god.

1081
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,460
How do I get enough...

1082
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,120
I got a bit too excited.

1083
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,700
How do I get enough momentum, though?

1084
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,390
Did we manage to eliminate them all?

1085
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,110
Give me my spoils.

1086
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,710
It seems the bugs have been removed.

1087
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:51,810
Are there any health?

1088
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:53,890
None?

1089
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:54,510
Okay.

1090
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:56,990
That's fine.

1091
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,270
That's okay.

1092
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,090
There's information...

1093
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,970
Feels like their sleeping posture is quite poor.

1094
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:03,830
No, please.

1095
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:04,130
Quite poor.

1096
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,290
Oh, my...

1097
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:05,770
My...

1098
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,150
First try.

1099
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,670
What a gamer.

1100
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,490
I know, right?

1101
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,170
We're gaming.

1102
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,650
We're gaming.

1103
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,750
Oh.

1104
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:15,850
Okay.

1105
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,170
We need to go beyond.

1106
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,230
We need the full momentum.

1107
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,410
I

1108
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,360
was trying to...

1109
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,780
I was trying to game you guys.

1110
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,240
I'll just drink you.

1111
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,520
It's not weird at all.

1112
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,440
Calorie mate.

1113
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,960
Is that a flirt?

1114
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,340
Hey, he brought it up first.

1115
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,000
Sometimes lunch ends up being late.

1116
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,140
What did you guys have for lunch today?

1117
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,480
Was it calorie mate and liquid dough?

1118
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,140
If not, what are you doing?

1119
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,580
If you drink me, you can replenish the five essential nutrients your body needs in a well-balanced manner.

1120
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:17,940
Butter chicken.

1121
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,380
Chicken.

1122
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,340
McDonald's.

1123
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,740
Free barbecue.

1124
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,720
I don't think it's 9 a.m.

1125
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,840
But what?

1126
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,420
Well, what will you have for lunch?

1127
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,540
What will you have for lunch then?

1128
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,240
During long development sessions, what stays with the creator to the end is nutrition.

1129
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,160
Hot dog.

1130
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,120
Having dinner, got some soup.

1131
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,220
What kind of soup?

1132
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,960
Balanced nutrition helps sustain strong performance.

1133
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,100
Wow, he just doesn't shut up.

1134
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,040
This is something I've heard.

1135
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,280
I think this would be so much better if he just stopped doing this.

1136
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,260
If I die again, you guys... If I die again, I'm switching the voices, okay?

1137
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,940
We'll switch it to Akio Otsuka.

1138
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,080
So that we can have Snake talking in our ear instead.

1139
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,960
I would leave now, but I don't want to do the boss battles.

1140
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,920
Oh my gosh, I think I have that same Tumblr.

1141
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,960
Something very similar.

1142
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,220
This guy doesn't even have an OPI mousepad.

1143
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,540
How much of a gamer are you?

1144
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,660
Alright, Hatsune Miku.

1145
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,440
Oh, what?

1146
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,800
Even the barrier hurts me?

1147
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,560
Come on, game.

1148
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,800
Don't be like that.

1149
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,980
Don't be like that, game.

1150
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,950
Please.

1151
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,210
Oh my gosh, my health.

1152
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,230
I don't think this is the run, you guys, but...

1153
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,590
Okay, join the idol club.

1154
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,630
Balanced nutrition helps sustain strong performance.

1155
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,470
This is something I've heard.

1156
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,030
Not...

1157
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:16,650
Huh?

1158
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:17,130
Ah!

1159
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,770
The flowchart has changed!

1160
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,710
The flowchart!

1161
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,730
This part's kind of awesome, I like it.

1162
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,430
Okay, someone said there was a shortcut, but...

1163
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,590
I... I'm not quite seeing the vision.

1164
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,370
Is it like from there to here?

1165
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,370
But I can't pass through the pleasure.

1166
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,310
I think I have to go.

1167
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,450
I actually have no idea where I need to go.

1168
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,750
Because you can control your own time, it's easy to become engrossed in production and eat irregularly.

1169
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:48,470
I actually don't know.

1170
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,490
Thank you!

1171
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:52,950
Wait, hold on.

1172
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,630
Sorry, I can't read the donuts.

1173
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:55,650
There we go.

1174
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,330
Liquid calorie mate is liquid snake.

1175
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,030
The regular calorie mate is solid snake.

1176
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,450
Does that make the jelly calorie mate solid-ish snake?

1177
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,970
No, it's literally solid-ish.

1178
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:05,350
Not solid-ish.

1179
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,590
It's neither liquid nor solid.

1180
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,190
Gosh!

1181
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:17,310
When you reach the checkpoints in this section, it starts an elevator platform that lets you get back part of the way once you fall.

1182
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,990
Ah, okay, cool.

1183
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,030
Ah, you know...

1184
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,230
Wait!

1185
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,010
A girl?

1186
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,870
A girl?

1187
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,030
Wait, where's...

1188
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,670
What?

1189
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,280
Oh my god, no, I'm gonna get...

1190
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,040
Oh, I see the...

1191
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,920
I see it, I see it.

1192
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:10,820
Okay.

1193
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,640
Okay.

1194
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,920
Okay.

1195
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,760
Oh my gosh.

1196
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,320
This is so hard!

1197
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,000
Ouch!

1198
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,520
Ah!

1199
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,200
It's a girl.

1200
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,320
It's a girl.

1201
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,560
It's a girl.

1202
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,720
It's a girl.

1203
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:28,900
I'm liquid.

1204
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,260
I'm liquid.

1205
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,780
Calorie mate liquid.

1206
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1207
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,260
I'm liquid.

1208
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,640
Calorie mate liquid.

1209
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,200
I'm liquid.

1210
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,780
Calorie mate liquid.

1211
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,240
Is this a...

1212
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,540
Is this a...

1213
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,040
Uh...

1214
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,100
What's his name?

1215
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,340
Wait, why is there only one voice in the English, but this one...

1216
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,860
Yeah, is this Kenjiro Tsuda?

1217
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,040
The guy from Jujutsu Kaisen.

1218
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,900
What's his name?

1219
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,640
Oh my gosh.

1220
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,980
Nanami, right?

1221
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,440
No.

1222
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,020
Why?

1223
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,720
I'm liquid.

1224
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,060
Calorie mate liquid.

1225
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,200
It tastes like a fruit mix.

1226
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,300
Nanami!

1227
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,060
My favorite character in Jujutsu Kaisen.

1228
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,500
That's a hard one.

1229
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,480
I'm liquid.

1230
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,600
Calorie mate liquid.

1231
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,780
It tastes like a yogurt.

1232
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,600
She's so cute!

1233
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:23,940
I'm liquid.

1234
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,220
Calorie mate liquid.

1235
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,420
It tastes like a fruit mix.

1236
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,820
I'm liquid.

1237
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,160
Calorie mate liquid.

1238
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,100
Wait, I knew that.

1239
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,100
I knew it was Mikuhito.

1240
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,280
I remember seeing the...

1241
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
Yes, I remember.

1242
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,260
Okay.

1243
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,040
Yes, yes, yes.

1244
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,520
I knew that.

1245
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,900
Because I remember them saying who they say you were.

1246
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,300
I just forgot about him.

1247
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:44,620
I'm liquid.

1248
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,360
Calorie mate liquid.

1249
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,840
It tastes like a fruit mix.

1250
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,040
I thought the...

1251
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,600
Okay.

1252
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,720
It's so weird that the English doesn't have different voices then.

1253
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,660
Okay, let's go.

1254
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,440
Wait,

1255
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,260
I'm not gonna skip this.

1256
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:25,800
I'm liquid.

1257
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,460
Calorie mate liquid.

1258
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,880
I'm liquid.

1259
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,780
Calorie mate liquid.

1260
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,360
I don't remember a single word he said.

1261
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:39,820
I don't remember a word he said.

1262
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,100
Who had this inspiration why he goes everywhere.

1263
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,680
He was not my history teacher.

1264
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,320
He taught me about things The、 End recently.

1265
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,340
...

1266
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:46,740
I...

1267
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,640
It sounds so... good.

1268
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,940
I'm normal.

1269
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,160
I'm normal, I'm normal.

1270
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,960
Why do you have to say it like...

1271
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,400
Banana to Ringo da.

1272
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,280
Okay, I'm normal.

1273
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,240
Oh!

1274
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,760
Oh my gosh.

1275
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:20,800
Thank you.

1276
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:28,740
Wait.

1277
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,100
I think I can get there from here.

1278
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,240
Yeah.

1279
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,900
Alright, I'm a pro now.

1280
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,300
Oh, shoot.

1281
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:42,900
I'm not a pro.

1282
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,020
I'm not a pro.

1283
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1284
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:45,960
Am I done?

1285
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,200
Am I not?

1286
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,080
Okay.

1287
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,560
I'm a pro, I'm a pro, I'm a pro.

1288
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,660
I can't see anything.

1289
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,060
Okay.

1290
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,680
Ouch!

1291
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,140
Not yet.

1292
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:12,860
Not yet.

1293
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,920
Come on, get out of my way.

1294
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,040
Okay.

1295
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,620
Alright.

1296
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,840
Alright.

1297
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,120
We're gaming, we're gaming, we're gaming.

1298
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,940
Okay.

1299
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,760
Parkour, parkour.

1300
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,840
Unfair, you!

1301
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,100
Unfair!

1302
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,480
Unfair, so unfair.

1303
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,920
Okay.

1304
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,180
So unfair.

1305
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:52,980
Unfair.

1306
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:53,760
Okay.

1307
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,000
What the?

1308
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,380
I'm losing so much health.

1309
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,180
Because of these dang guys.

1310
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,020
Oh my gosh.

1311
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:07,760
No, no, no.

1312
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,800
Oh my God.

1313
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1314
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:13,820
Oh my gosh, please.

1315
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:14,760
Please!

1316
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,450
Oh, nice timing.

1317
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:21,610
Nice timing.

1318
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,130
Look at him just staring at...

1319
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:25,490
Ah!

1320
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:26,170
Ah!

1321
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,640
Oh my god!

1322
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,540
This guy sucks!

1323
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,830
Otsuka's voice coming from the cat is killing me.

1324
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,670
It was kind of worth it.

1325
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,270
It was kind of worth it.

1326
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:14,510
Snake!

1327
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:14,910
Snake!

1328
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:16,390
Snake!

1329
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:30,720
I want to know what he says about the other stuff, but we can't get too hot.

1330
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,940
Especially because the last area takes so long.

1331
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
His voice is so cool!

1332
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,780
Oh my god, his voice is...

1333
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,700
Unfair.

1334
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,120
Oh, okay.

1335
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,540
Actually, it was maybe a good thing we...

1336
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,340
Oh my god!

1337
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:57,740
Stop!

1338
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,840
Why isn't there like a...

1339
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,140
Why isn't there like a...

1340
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,420
What's it called?

1341
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,340
A cool down.

1342
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,640
I should have some eye frames, a little bit.

1343
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,270
This is so painful!

1344
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,710
Did anybody watch Maddy play this?

1345
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,730
How did she fare?

1346
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,010
I'm curious.

1347
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,730
He pressed space!

1348
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,430
What happened?

1349
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,770
She finished in 45 minutes?

1350
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:44,550
She's such a gamer.

1351
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,910
This game is crazy.

1352
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:54,910
Okay.

1353
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,330
Okay.

1354
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,700
Come here.

1355
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,700
Yeah!

1356
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,200
And then... come here.

1357
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:14,880
Oh my gosh.

1358
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,520
Oh my gosh!

1359
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:15,760
Stop!

1360
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,520
Don't hurt me!

1361
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:16,840
Stop!

1362
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,480
Stop!

1363
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:18,640
Stop!

1364
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:23,820
Oh, shoot.

1365
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,120
That was me.

1366
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,740
That was all me.

1367
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,960
Oh my god, I got double hit.

1368
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,860
Guys, I don't think this is a run.

1369
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,660
Unless I can get more health.

1370
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,840
Which... they only drop sometimes.

1371
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,740
Not as often as you think they should.

1372
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,240
Buddy, if this is coming from your computer, I think you need some real help, man.

1373
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,380
Stop changing your stance mid-jump.

1374
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,480
Okay, I'll tell you why I keep doing that.

1375
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,420
It's my Minecraft brain.

1376
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,040
Okay?

1377
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,320
My Minecraft brain tells me shift is run.

1378
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,920
Or shift is like go faster.

1379
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,140
And so I'm doing it because I'm like, oh, I want to propel.

1380
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,200
I want to jump higher.

1381
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,360
So I keep pressing shift as if it's gonna make me faster.

1382
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:32,940
So that's why to just give you guys an explanation as to why I am constantly shifting up and down is because I'm using it.

1383
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,040
I'm thinking of it as like a go fast.

1384
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,900
Go faster.

1385
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,680
Because I'm a one-trick pony.

1386
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,080
I only play one game.

1387
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,920
And it makes me only know controls for a single game, you know?

1388
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,360
Yeah, block game brain.

1389
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,960
I literally just played it like yesterday.

1390
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,640
So I'm just kind of like...

1391
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,580
I'm just thinking about it, you know?

1392
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,160
Thinking about them beans.

1393
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,620
Oh, come on.

1394
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,820
Oh, that was...

1395
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:23,940
But sometimes I do it on purpose like that where I want to actually stick the landing, you know?

1396
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,920
He screams like you?

1397
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,520
Stop.

1398
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,280
Stop complimenting me.

1399
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:58,460
Stop complimenting me.

1400
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,720
Ouch, ouch.

1401
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:06,220
Okay.

1402
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,440
That was close.

1403
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,840
Actually, that super chat saved me.

1404
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1405
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:31,780
Okay.

1406
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,560
Oh...

1407
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,300
Betrayed by chat.

1408
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,300
Any house in the room?

1409
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,540
Any house in the room?

1410
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,620
Any house in the room?

1411
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,980
No, I don't think so.

1412
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,600
It's okay.

1413
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,880
It's fine.

1414
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,620
It's fine.

1415
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,340
Okay.

1416
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,140
Oh...

1417
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,680
Fine.

1418
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:13,880
The aim of the game creator is to try to digest the dishwasher after work yesterday.

1419
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:14,300
The aim of the game creator is to try to digest the dishwasher after work yesterday.

1420
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,320
Hmm.

1421
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,060
Is the health in the room with us?

1422
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:24,320
No.

1423
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:26,860
Okay.

1424
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,260
Okie dokie.

1425
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,400
Do you think at any point he'll say, you sent to da?

1426
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,700
Do you think at any point he'll say, you sent to da?

1427
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:51,760
Do you think at any point he'll say, you sent to da?

1428
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,300
Do you think at any point he'll say, you sent to da?

1429
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:52,800
Do you think at any point he'll say, you sent to da?

1430
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,460
I love how the voices for the guy in Japanese sounds so cool.

1431
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,740
But in English, just sounds like the Nintendo Direct dude.

1432
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,480
It's like, ah!

1433
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,340
Why is that her beat?

1434
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,100
Oh my gosh, I'm not trying to escape.

1435
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,260
I'm just trying to...

1436
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,440
I'm just trying to live, man.

1437
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,820
Okay, we'll wait for the night.

1438
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,800
We'll wait for the night.

1439
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,420
I don't know how I'm gonna get through this.

1440
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,520
I'm not even like...

1441
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,560
By the time I get to the part where I get to though, I'm not even like halfway through.

1442
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,260
It's kind of insane.

1443
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,840
I don't know how I'm gonna be able to get through the rest of this.

1444
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:41,640
For real.

1445
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,320
Nice.

1446
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,160
And she's stuck the landing.

1447
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:55,850
It's the dev of...

1448
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,830
Of the Master Collection Volume 2.

1449
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:04,430
Oh my gosh.

1450
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,010
Ouch.

1451
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:06,050
Ah!

1452
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:06,610
Ah!

1453
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:07,610
No!

1454
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:10,830
No!

1455
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:12,310
Ouch!

1456
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,870
Why does that hurt me?

1457
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:15,650
Oh my god.

1458
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:16,810
Oh my god.

1459
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:17,150
Oh my god.

1460
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:18,730
Everything hurts.

1461
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:19,730
Everything...

1462
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:21,650
Everything hurts.

1463
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:22,850
It's too painful.

1464
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,410
Oh my god, the night.

1465
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,230
The shortcut?

1466
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,110
It's not there!

1467
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:29,690
It wasn't there!

1468
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,390
It only appears, I think, once I get to the yellow.

1469
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:41,460
Okay.

1470
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,200
Nice.

1471
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,040
Okay.

1472
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:48,980
Wait for it to come back.

1473
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,160
Yeah, I have to land on the yellow before I get there.

1474
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,860
I have to get the shortcut.

1475
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:53,180
See?

1476
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,440
It only appears...

1477
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:56,980
Once I'm there.

1478
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,520
I want to make a good game.

1479
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,800
That is the important aim of the creator.

1480
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:03,940
Yeah!

1481
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:04,940
Oh, there... See?

1482
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,140
See?

1483
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:05,400
See?

1484
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:05,540
See?

1485
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:05,620
See?

1486
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,080
There's one.

1487
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:06,500
There's one.

1488
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:06,900
Okay.

1489
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:07,140
Okay.

1490
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:07,600
I see it now.

1491
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:08,800
Okay.

1492
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,720
And then it creates another shortcut, I think?

1493
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,020
When it comes to Calorie Mate, many people think of the block type.

1494
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,840
But in fact, the origin of Calorie Mate...

1495
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:24,440
Okay.

1496
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:24,860
Okay.

1497
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,340
...is actually me.

1498
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:26,800
Ouch!

1499
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,380
Ouch!

1500
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,080
This is a mistake.

1501
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,880
It's just a human being.

1502
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,200
I think it saved me.

1503
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:32,840
Okay.

1504
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:33,720
Okay.

1505
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,560
Alright.

1506
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:35,140
Alright.

1507
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,340
Oh, come on...

1508
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:37,520
ouch!

1509
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,360
What just hurt me...?

1510
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,240
Okay.

1511
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,240
Checkpoint!

1512
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:42,680
Maybe?

1513
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:43,600
Okay.

1514
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,140
I found a checkpoint.

1515
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:48,800
Okay.

1516
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,240
Okay.

1517
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:49,880
No!

1518
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:50,420
No!

1519
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:51,680
Where does it go?

1520
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:51,840
This is it.

1521
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:52,880
I'm going to be fired eventually.

1522
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:53,540
Okay.

1523
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,360
Okay.

1524
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:55,260
Oh my god.

1525
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,160
Where do I go, you guys?

1526
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,920
Wait, I don't know.

1527
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,100
Where do I go?

1528
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,240
Which way is the correct way?

1529
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,760
There's green, there's blue.

1530
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,720
Follow the green.

1531
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,500
To the blue after?

1532
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,740
I don't know.

1533
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,060
The green, the green, okay.

1534
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,050
Wait, what about the checkpoint?

1535
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,310
Oh, I see, I see, I see where, I see, I see, I see.

1536
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,840
Okay, I see, I see.

1537
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,180
Wait,

1538
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,900
it takes me to here, okay, okay.

1539
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,600
I see, I see.

1540
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,560
I see, I see.

1541
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:04,910
Okay.

1542
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:06,470
Oh, that was close, that was close.

1543
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:08,070
I don't think it got me.

1544
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,670
Drink on the keyboard?

1545
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:12,950
Wait, what do you mean?

1546
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,070
Okay.

1547
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,150
So this one...

1548
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:19,790
It just...

1549
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:25,690
I think I can just jump from here.

1550
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:26,750
Okay, alright.

1551
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:33,850
Ah!

1552
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:41,570
Now what?

1553
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:42,970
Um, now what?

1554
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,070
Where do I go?

1555
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,010
Oh, down?

1556
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,830
Okay, okay.

1557
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:48,330
Oh my gosh.

1558
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,370
I did it!

1559
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,020
You guys, this game is unfair.

1560
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,920
This game is so unfair.

1561
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,960
I didn't even... What are you talking about?

1562
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,060
No, no, no, no.

1563
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,400
Oh my god.

1564
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:27,600
Why is the octopus just all over the place?

1565
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,920
Oh my god.

1566
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,980
Blinking lights equals bad, okay.

1567
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh my god, did I just get hurt again?

1568
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,280
No way.

1569
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,420
The tacos are killing me!

1570
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,960
The tacos!

1571
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:50,640
The tacos!

1572
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,800
Oh my gosh, there's so many tacos.

1573
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,400
Shortcut next to the TV?

1574
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,880
I don't see it.

1575
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,740
I don't think there is one.

1576
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,240
Oh, unless you mean that one right there.

1577
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,540
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1578
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,380
Why are there so many...

1579
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,000
This is... This is so broken!

1580
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:15,940
This is so broken!

1581
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:18,280
I can't get through because of this damn guy!

1582
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,040
Oh my... It's Squid Game!

1583
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,260
Not Squid Game.

1584
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,860
It's... It's Suica Game!

1585
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,860
Oh my god, it's Suica Game where the tacos...

1586
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,120
If they combine, they become a bigger taco!

1587
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,260
No, no, I can't get through!

1588
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,620
Oh my god.

1589
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,640
No, please, please.

1590
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:51,820
Please.

1591
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:54,660
Please.

1592
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,290
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1593
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:01,470
Please!

1594
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,350
Don't let me die!

1595
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,390
I hate the tacos!

1596
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,450
Oh my gosh.

1597
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:11,230
Oh my gosh, I can't get through because of these damn guys.

1598
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,410
There's too... There's too...

1599
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,470
Drop down to blue?

1600
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:21,510
From here?

1601
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,710
How do you know which one's blinking?

1602
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,330
I can't even...

1603
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,450
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

1604
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:35,570
Just go for it?

1605
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:36,370
Lucky.

1606
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,650
You think I can make it there?

1607
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:47,720
Oh!

1608
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:48,980
Oh!

1609
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:51,190
Ah!

1610
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:52,050
Ah!

1611
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:52,530
Ah!

1612
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:57,110
Gah!

1613
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,030
Gah!

1614
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:01,250
Oops.

1615
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:02,270
I don't know where I am.

1616
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:03,610
Actually.

1617
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:04,290
I was...

1618
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,910
I... I, I don't know where I am.

1619
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,910
You guys have one hit and I'm dead.

1620
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:12,230
I have one hit and I'm dead.

1621
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,070
Ooh.

1622
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:16,590
Cyrillic grunting noises.

1623
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,630
Oh there I am!

1624
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,070
There I am.

1625
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,800
Oh, it's on top of the table.

1626
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,140
Okay, or on top of the TV.

1627
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,680
I like how I can avoid pretty much all of this.

1628
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
Actually, why don't I just do that instead?

1629
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,420
I was right there!

1630
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,640
What killed me?

1631
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:42,940
Was it one of the little teddy bears?

1632
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,260
Was it one of the teddy bears?

1633
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,440
Oh my gosh.

1634
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,420
Okay, cat.

1635
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,600
I wasn't even close to you.

1636
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,540
Okay,

1637
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,280
cat, it's so funny.

1638
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,340
Oh my gosh.

1639
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,380
Ouch,

1640
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:27,900
ouch, ouch, ouch.

1641
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1642
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,420
Don't touch me.

1643
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:37,740
Okay.

1644
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,240
Okay.

1645
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:59,270
Trying to make sure... I can't tell sometimes where they drop, you know?

1646
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:05,380
Okay.

1647
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:06,620
Yeah!

1648
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,420
Help!

1649
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,840
You guys were going in with full health.

1650
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,700
Okay, we got this.

1651
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,060
I don't even need... Actually, let's take my riches.

1652
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,460
Let's take my riches before they disappear.

1653
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,340
Okay, whatever.

1654
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:29,940
It's fine.

1655
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,400
What the hell is this game?

1656
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,720
It's fine, though!

1657
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:35,940
I got you!

1658
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,580
This is the run.

1659
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,640
Don't jinx me, you guys.

1660
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:51,960
Stop it.

1661
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,540
Stop talking.

1662
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,040
See?!

1663
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,840
See?!

1664
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,640
See?!

1665
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,720
Stop talking.

1666
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,860
Stop talking.

1667
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,400
Stop chatting.

1668
01:14:59,800 --> 01:14:59,800
Stop talking.

1669
01:14:59,800 --> 01:14:59,800
Stop chatting.

1670
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,860
Stop chatting.

1671
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,380
I'm gonna turn emo only on... I'm gonna turn emo only on...

1672
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,120
I don't think you can do that on YouTube.

1673
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:14,830
She hurts us!

1674
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:15,810
Oh my gosh!

1675
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:16,630
What's wrong with me?

1676
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,970
Why can't I get it this time anymore?

1677
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:24,870
It's like the easiest part.

1678
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,090
See?

1679
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,770
It's because you guys kept saying it's the run.

1680
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,350
It's because you guys kept saying it's the run.

1681
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:42,470
It's because you guys kept saying it's the run.

1682
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,560
This is not the run.

1683
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,020
Exactly.

1684
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:53,540
Exactly.

1685
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:55,720
Exactly.

1686
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,020
Exactly.

1687
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,440
Okay.

1688
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:03,520
So now we know that from here we can just skip some parts.

1689
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,860
Oh my gosh.

1690
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,380
Walk away.

1691
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,920
Flowchart be damned.

1692
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15,880
I don't care about a flowchart.

1693
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:21,360
I don't care about the flowchart.

1694
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,600
Miku!

1695
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:31,340
Oh

1696
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:39,270
gosh.

1697
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:39,790
Oh gosh.

1698
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,210
The camera.

1699
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:40,910
Oh camera.

1700
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:41,670
Oh camera.

1701
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,560
Yeah!

1702
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:53,900
Yeah!

1703
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:58,880
Oh!

1704
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,800
That was so close!

1705
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,460
Holy cow!

1706
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,560
No!

1707
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,180
Uh...

1708
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,500
Yeah, I'm just gonna go for this.

1709
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,480
Come down, please!

1710
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:16,640
Oh.

1711
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,200
Uh...

1712
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:18,940
Come down, please!

1713
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:23,800
Oh.

1714
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,520
Uh...

1715
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,860
I just gotta be good enough to get it?

1716
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:27,960
Oh my god, oh my god.

1717
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:28,920
Come down, please!

1718
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,200
Drink me!

1719
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,160
What the- Okay.

1720
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:36,760
Okay!

1721
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:38,720
Stop!

1722
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,920
You're gonna flesher me!

1723
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,020
Akiyousuka, please!

1724
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,340
Oh my god!

1725
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,440
Don't say it like that!

1726
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,900
Oh my gosh...

1727
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:47,920
I can't see anything.

1728
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,180
Okay, hold on.

1729
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:50,680
I can't see anything.

1730
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,440
Okay, hold on.

1731
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:54,520
Oh!

1732
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,820
I can't s- Okay, there we go.

1733
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,080
Okay.

1734
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,770
I can't... this damn camera angle, man!

1735
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,020
Oh my gosh, please.

1736
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,840
It's the camera angle.

1737
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,200
Okay.

1738
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:26,370
Why did I... I'm so stupid.

1739
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:30,970
Oh, it's harder.

1740
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:33,890
The shortcut is actually harder than doing it normally.

1741
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,710
I'll be honest.

1742
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,730
The shortcut makes it so much more difficult.

1743
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:44,190
Okay.

1744
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:51,650
Okay.

1745
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:54,770
Okay.

1746
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,100
Nice.

1747
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:00,880
Ow!

1748
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:01,460
What hit me?

1749
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:03,060
Okay.

1750
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,340
Oh, okay.

1751
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,280
Alright.

1752
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,320
We got our little shortcut here.

1753
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:12,680
Okay.

1754
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:13,820
Ouch!

1755
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,260
Ouch!

1756
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:14,600
Ouch!

1757
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:14,800
Ouch!

1758
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,020
Ouch!

1759
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:16,820
Okay.

1760
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,140
Uh, then this comes down.

1761
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:21,540
Okay.

1762
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:22,840
Alright.

1763
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,140
Yeah!

1764
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:27,480
Okay.

1765
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,960
Do you think I can make it in yet?

1766
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,800
Do you think I can make it in yet?

1767
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:33,320
Kotaku!

1768
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,480
Welcome to my bishop, thank you!

1769
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:40,590
Oh!

1770
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:40,830
Oh!

1771
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:41,310
Oh!

1772
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,810
Oh!

1773
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:44,190
Oh my god.

1774
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:44,590
Ouch!

1775
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:44,890
Ouch!

1776
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,030
Ouch!

1777
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,150
Ouch!

1778
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:45,270
Ouch!

1779
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:46,590
Wait!

1780
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:47,410
Oh no!

1781
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:49,270
I don't have the shortcut because I never made it to the blue!

1782
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:50,510
No!

1783
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,340
Oh!

1784
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,140
Oh my gosh!

1785
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:54,860
Stay away from me.

1786
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:01,400
We're gonna have to go through... this way.

1787
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:02,500
Maybe.

1788
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,760
If I can even make it.

1789
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:04,400
Oh my gosh!

1790
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,080
Oh my god!

1791
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:06,420
Stop!

1792
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:07,820
Oh.

1793
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:08,880
Wait.

1794
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:09,720
No.

1795
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:09,900
No.

1796
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:10,060
No.

1797
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:10,080
Oh no!

1798
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:10,980
Leave me alone!

1799
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:11,420
Leave me alone!

1800
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:12,760
Leave me alone!

1801
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:21,610
Green shortcut...

1802
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:22,570
Oh, that's right!

1803
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,110
Thank you guys!

1804
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,010
I forgot about that one.

1805
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:24,830
Yes, thank you.

1806
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:30,290
Oh my gosh.

1807
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:31,310
Camera angle.

1808
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,430
Camera angle.

1809
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:33,970
It was...

1810
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,670
Why can't I go through here?

1811
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:37,690
Okay.

1812
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:39,310
Sure.

1813
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,190
I'm...

1814
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,450
Sure, there we go.

1815
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:42,750
What's happening?

1816
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:42,850
What's happening?

1817
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:43,850
No!

1818
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,190
Oh my god.

1819
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,470
It's so fast!

1820
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:50,030
Go away!

1821
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:58,430
I'm getting too hot.

1822
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:03,690
Oh my gosh.

1823
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:04,150
Please.

1824
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:11,930
You...

1825
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:13,470
Bastards!

1826
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,150
Oh my god.

1827
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,530
Why does this shortcut suck so bad?

1828
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:22,870
I can't see anything!

1829
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,400
It spawns as it hits the ground?

1830
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,660
No, it goes up and down.

1831
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,360
Does it not?

1832
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:35,660
Oh my god.

1833
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:36,920
See it?

1834
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,380
No, no, no.

1835
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,340
You have to jump onto it.

1836
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,140
You have to jump onto it.

1837
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,640
Jump from the table.

1838
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,900
Yeah, that's probably a better idea.

1839
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,360
You're probably smarter than me.

1840
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:45,740
Okay.

1841
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,160
Okay.

1842
01:21:58,530 --> 01:21:59,090
Fairy...

1843
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:01,410
Okay?

1844
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:16,170
Yes!

1845
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:19,390
Yes!

1846
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:20,790
Is it correct?

1847
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:25,670
Oh, I see.

1848
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,000
It's okay, we still made it.

1849
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,740
I did it.

1850
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,460
You rock.

1851
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,260
So weird.

1852
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh my god, this bastard!

1853
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:48,820
Don't come back here.

1854
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,160
Don't you dare.

1855
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:52,820
Oh my god.

1856
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,340
Okay.

1857
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:55,680
IKIMASU!

1858
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,380
Okay, uh...

1859
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,280
It's fine.

1860
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,680
Just go back around this way.

1861
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:06,980
Oh, okay.

1862
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:07,820
That's fine.

1863
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,560
That's why I kind of went for it.

1864
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,040
Because the guy was starting to walk by.

1865
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,160
The timing was a little... Come on.

1866
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,540
The timing was not so great.

1867
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,240
The timing was...

1868
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:20,880
Oh my gosh.

1869
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,960
The timing was not so good.

1870
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:23,760
I think.

1871
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:28,820
Oh my god.

1872
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,820
I'm starting to get too hot.

1873
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,180
He's walking back even.

1874
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,160
He's gonna come this way!

1875
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,180
Dramatic gallery mate.

1876
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:39,180
Okay.

1877
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,640
There we go.

1878
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:43,500
Okay, there we go.

1879
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:09,550
I'm getting too hot.

1880
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:10,910
I'm gonna die from heat.

1881
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:12,990
Oh my god.

1882
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,210
I know.

1883
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,300
What do you mean, why do I have to jump?

1884
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,780
What are you saying?

1885
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:24,960
Why do I have to...

1886
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,840
Am I doing it improperly?

1887
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,880
No, I think I have to jump.

1888
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:30,600
Okay.

1889
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:31,480
Shh.

1890
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:35,560
Ugh!

1891
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:36,220
Ugh!

1892
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:36,960
Ugh!

1893
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,160
Wait, help!

1894
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,860
This is so bad.

1895
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,940
Why can't I break this part?

1896
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:46,760
Unless I...

1897
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:49,960
You can roll across it?

1898
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,680
Wait, I thought it was a... Oh my god.

1899
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,120
No, no, no, no.

1900
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,140
Oh, that was close.

1901
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:54,820
Turn around!

1902
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,400
Wait, I can just roll here?

1903
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,800
I thought it was a...

1904
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,120
I thought it was... wait.

1905
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,380
Can I roll here?

1906
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,800
Wait, it's a bridge?

1907
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:09,880
I thought it was just...

1908
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,940
Wait, this is not... I will...

1909
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,240
No, I go through this.

1910
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:13,720
Do I not?

1911
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,360
It's a glass path?

1912
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,260
No, it's not.

1913
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:20,700
Oh!

1914
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:24,680
Oh!

1915
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:27,820
That's a gla...

1916
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:29,100
That's a gla...

1917
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,200
I don't know, though, guys.

1918
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:33,740
I don't know, though, guys.

1919
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,740
I think I'll die more likely doing that.

1920
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,700
Why do you think the coins were there?

1921
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,660
To jump into the air and get them.

1922
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,300
To jump into the air and get them.

1923
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:45,980
Oh.

1924
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,180
Wait, I legitimately thought that that was a path.

1925
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:50,300
I just thought it was...

1926
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,280
I'm connected because of the flowchart, but I legitimately thought it was a path you had to jump over.

1927
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,520
I legitimately thought that.

1928
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,040
How am I goofy?

1929
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,820
Do you think if I reach 20 degrees, then it's over?

1930
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:10,400
Do you think that's the degree that I can't reach?

1931
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,580
Oh my gosh.

1932
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,800
Okay, well, I have to rush for it then.

1933
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:17,300
What?

1934
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:20,540
Why don't you do this to me?

1935
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,260
Oh no, I made it to 20, and I'm fine.

1936
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:28,280
I was so close!

1937
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,840
Okay, we got this.

1938
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,680
I SPEEVE.

1939
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,060
I SPEEVE, everybody, I SPEEVE.

1940
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:39,060
I don't SPEEVE.

1941
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,880
I don't SPEEVE, actually.

1942
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:43,780
I don't SPEEVE, actually.

1943
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,380
This thing is going to kill me.

1944
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:44,940
It's these things.

1945
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:47,880
I don't speed.

1946
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,560
Do you think if I go really fast, it'll work?

1947
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:56,360
Well, I'm going to die anyway, so...

1948
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,020
Okay.

1949
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,400
All right.

1950
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,920
We can get there fast, you guys.

1951
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:04,760
We can get this fast.

1952
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,060
We got this.

1953
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,060
Okay.

1954
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:10,660
Wait, hold on.

1955
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,280
Oh, sorry.

1956
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,120
I just messed up my setup.

1957
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,180
Hold on.

1958
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,100
I just messed up my setup.

1959
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:14,520
Okay.

1960
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:14,760
There we go.

1961
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,060
Okay.

1962
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:16,620
Let's go!

1963
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,600
This is the run, maybe.

1964
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:20,480
Okay.

1965
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,280
I speed because...

1966
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,620
I don't know.

1967
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,280
Oh, I don't speed.

1968
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,120
Guys, I don't speed.

1969
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,860
I don't believe anymore.

1970
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,280
I don't believe anymore.

1971
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,280
Snake line for good luck.

1972
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,940
I don't know why I don't just like do this.

1973
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:51,820
Oh, that's funny.

1974
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,360
Oh, okay.

1975
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,100
Okay.

1976
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,250
Okay.

1977
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:11,410
Okay.

1978
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:11,490
One more guy.

1979
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,550
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1980
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,990
Okay.

1981
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,370
It was that easy the whole time.

1982
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:33,250
Look, I like a challenge, okay?

1983
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,170
I'm challenging myself.

1984
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:39,190
I have to get better at the parkour anyway.

1985
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:44,810
Anyway, so, why not just make it more difficult on myself all the time, okay?

1986
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:47,130
You guys don't understand my genius.

1987
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:55,250
You don't understand my genius!

1988
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:02,810
4D chess, exactly!

1989
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:06,030
Something you guys are playing, checkers.

1990
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:08,990
I am playing 4D chess.

1991
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:10,150
No!

1992
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,630
My spoils!

1993
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:12,110
My riches!

1994
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:14,370
Why do they disappear so fast?

1995
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:17,690
My riches!

1996
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:18,330
My riches!

1997
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:27,330
Oh, why did I...

1998
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:30,730
Okay, I'm all topsy-turvy right now.

1999
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:37,110
Oh.

2000
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:38,850
Okay.

2001
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:39,950
Perfect.

2002
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:46,130
Here we go.

2003
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:51,630
You can jump from the bed to the planter table.

2004
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,770
Planter table?

2005
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:56,650
Yeah, that's what I did.

2006
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:00,230
Wait.

2007
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:01,130
Isn't that what I did?

2008
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:03,970
Okay.

2009
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,110
Okay.

2010
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,360
Oh,

2011
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:22,500
I don't like round table.

2012
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:24,160
I've been upon it for a long time.

2013
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,160
Oh, I can see you.

2014
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,020
I'll bring you down.

2015
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,380
Not bad.

2016
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:37,400
It's just that I don't like round table.

2017
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:37,640
I was lucky on other denen.

2018
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:37,980
You don't like round table.

2019
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,020
It's hard to know.

2020
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:40,400
Okay.

2021
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,420
I'll put you down.

2022
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,140
Alright.

2023
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,940
I don't know what you're talking about, the bed to the planter.

2024
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:50,800
There's no planter in here.

2025
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,360
Oh, okay, so...

2026
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,560
Oh my god!

2027
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:55,900
Oh my god!

2028
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,320
Oh, I did not expect him again.

2029
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,960
Oh my gosh, he scared me.

2030
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,400
Oh, please.

2031
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:08,900
Oh, gosh.

2032
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,200
I took too long.

2033
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:10,600
I know.

2034
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,500
I forgot about him.

2035
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,440
I forgot about him, you guys.

2036
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:12,980
Hello?

2037
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:13,840
Hello?

2038
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:14,800
There we go.

2039
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:24,490
Why do you think I've been jumping through it the entire time?

2040
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:26,350
Like, through these jumps.

2041
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:30,810
Because I thought I had to jump through them every time.

2042
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:35,430
But then it makes sense because I've been...

2043
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:36,350
Really?

2044
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:37,090
Seriously?

2045
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:38,890
Oh, come on.

2046
01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:43,090
I don't know, guys.

2047
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,370
Okay, my brain works in mysterious ways.

2048
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:46,490
Just let me live.

2049
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:47,750
Or, I'm not living.

2050
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:48,330
I'm dead.

2051
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:48,890
But you know.

2052
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,450
Just let me be dead.

2053
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,750
In my own way.

2054
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:52,970
Okay.

2055
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,280
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2056
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,240
I don't learn my lesson.

2057
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:14,530
And I keep missing this one.

2058
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:22,740
Okay.

2059
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,180
We're making the worst game ever!

2060
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,020
This game sucks!

2061
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,780
What is this flow chart?

2062
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,010
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch!

2063
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:47,550
So rude.

2064
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,670
So rude.

2065
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:54,670
So, so rude.

2066
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:14,290
Pain.

2067
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:16,790
Pain.

2068
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:18,710
Get some health.

2069
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:19,170
How?

2070
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:19,690
Where?

2071
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:22,510
Sometimes the cats don't drop it, though.

2072
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:24,930
Sometimes I don't drop it.

2073
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,970
I disappoint Snake.

2074
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:29,650
I disappoint everybody, okay?

2075
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:31,210
I've disappointed my mom.

2076
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:33,410
I've disappointed my...

2077
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:34,670
My family.

2078
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,790
Who's to say that...

2079
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:40,790
You know, Snake is just another person on the list to disappoint.

2080
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:43,850
You know, Snake is just another person on the list to disappoint.

2081
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:44,690
Is this what you call a cat?

2082
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:48,710
There is hope.

2083
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:54,970
Will you prepare for the mission, move around, and make a sound?

2084
01:33:58,130 --> 01:33:59,870
The cat just took me out!

2085
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:09,040
You guys, I have to be bad at the game also because otherwise it would be like such a short stream, you know?

2086
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,560
You guys don't want that, right?

2087
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,000
Oh, I'm done with the stream.

2088
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,120
See you later.

2089
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:37,460
Oh shoot.

2090
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:37,960
Ouch!

2091
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:39,580
Oh gosh.

2092
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,540
Oh gosh.

2093
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,360
I can't see anything!

2094
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,140
Okay.

2095
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,700
Oh my gosh.

2096
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,860
I lost a lot of health there.

2097
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:52,420
You assholes!

2098
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,560
You're all assholes!

2099
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:55,760
You're all assholes!

2100
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:06,730
Okay.

2101
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:14,870
Wasted my health.

2102
01:35:16,270 --> 01:35:16,990
Okay.

2103
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:17,690
Okay.

2104
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:20,250
Oh, whoa.

2105
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:22,090
Thank goodness that...

2106
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:23,450
Ah!

2107
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:24,270
Ouch!

2108
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:27,300
Ouch!

2109
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:27,520
Ouch!

2110
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:27,720
Ouch!

2111
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,020
Ouch!

2112
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,160
Phew.

2113
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,340
Any health?

2114
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:39,960
Yippee!

2115
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:46,100
I don't think the bug should...

2116
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:46,320
I don't think the bug should...

2117
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,300
be able to, like, change between coins and health.

2118
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:48,840
I'm just saying.

2119
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,740
Or if you collect a certain amount of coins, you get more health or something.

2120
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:55,820
Like 50.

2121
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:56,860
I can get 50.

2122
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:15,400
Oh wait, you mean from this side I can jump onto this bug plan or...

2123
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,380
plant... plant bugger... wait.

2124
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,700
This bug...

2125
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:20,900
Wait.

2126
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:22,920
To the table!

2127
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,740
She's malfunctioning.

2128
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,300
Oh

2129
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,990
my gosh.

2130
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,970
You guys.

2131
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:55,810
I'm so...

2132
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,410
I'm so cooked.

2133
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:05,210
I'm so cooked right now.

2134
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:07,790
Oh my gosh.

2135
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:13,110
Wait a second.

2136
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:14,610
Can't I just sneak?

2137
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:15,190
Oh no.

2138
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:15,430
Okay.

2139
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,390
There's a thing right there.

2140
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:19,210
Ugh.

2141
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:20,790
Ugh.

2142
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:21,990
Ugh.

2143
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,550
So funny.

2144
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:34,610
She just thinks...

2145
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:34,830
Oh wait.

2146
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:35,430
Just kidding.

2147
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:44,210
Okay.

2148
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,870
Okay.

2149
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:50,130
Are you okay?

2150
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:51,190
Is the heat getting to you?

2151
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:52,890
With some...

2152
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:58,390
Oh my gosh.

2153
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:03,010
Oh my gosh.

2154
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:03,230
Oh my gosh.

2155
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:03,310
Oh my...

2156
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:03,310
Oh!

2157
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:03,810
Ouch!

2158
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:04,690
No!

2159
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:08,190
Ouch!

2160
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:08,590
Ouch!

2161
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:12,250
You guys, I'm regressing.

2162
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:13,110
Truly.

2163
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:15,430
I'm regressing.

2164
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:16,090
I'm regressing.

2165
01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:21,510
I didn't know that I was gonna be touching his heels.

2166
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:23,150
That's so unfair.

2167
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,470
Jump across from the arm of the couch?

2168
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:26,910
Like here?

2169
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:33,220
Let's see.

2170
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,840
Oh my god.

2171
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,480
Oh my god.

2172
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,620
Yeah, I need the rolling though.

2173
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:45,480
Oh my gosh.

2174
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,020
Go, go, go.

2175
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,680
I always overdo it.

2176
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,800
Touching the wall is diabolical.

2177
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:02,420
The fact that that gets you points off.

2178
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:04,920
Like...

2179
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,920
We need to trigger the...

2180
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,720
We need to trigger the cutscene.

2181
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:22,850
Okay, let's go back now.

2182
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:25,910
We broke the sequence of events.

2183
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:27,330
So we need to go back.

2184
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,110
Okay.

2185
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:29,970
Oh my god.

2186
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:33,030
Go!

2187
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:34,570
Go!

2188
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:35,910
Go!

2189
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,930
Go!

2190
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:36,690
Ahhhh!

2191
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:42,410
Uwaaah!

2192
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:44,050
Okay.

2193
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:44,510
Worth.

2194
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:45,790
Worth, worth, worth.

2195
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:47,790
Worth, worth, worth.

2196
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:50,330
No...

2197
01:39:50,330 --> 01:39:51,070
Hey.

2198
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:54,690
So worth.

2199
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,870
We hadn't gotten that one yet.

2200
01:39:58,510 --> 01:40:00,390
Can I stand on the little blue part?

2201
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:01,570
I don't want to try it though.

2202
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:04,230
It was worth it for that.

2203
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:05,930
Wasn't it, you guys?

2204
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:07,550
Oh!

2205
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:08,490
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2206
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:15,150
See?

2207
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:18,110
I think it's easier to jump through, that's why I keep jumping.

2208
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:23,510
Oh my gosh.

2209
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:24,310
OUCH!

2210
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:26,690
Thanks,

2211
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:33,920
I guess.

2212
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:36,520
Oh my god!

2213
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,000
Oh!

2214
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:37,540
Please!

2215
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:44,550
It's so unfair.

2216
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:45,890
Come here, little heart cat!

2217
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:46,410
Come here!

2218
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,910
Yeah!

2219
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:51,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2220
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:53,910
Maybe another heart cat will come over here.

2221
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:56,050
Come over here, your coin cat.

2222
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:57,130
I don't need you.

2223
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,930
Heart cat!

2224
01:40:58,070 --> 01:40:58,750
Come here, heart cat!

2225
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:02,630
And we got the checkpoint, I think, by the...

2226
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:07,030
By the... couch, right?

2227
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:08,410
I don't see it, though.

2228
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:10,690
I got a checkpoint, but...

2229
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:11,690
Heart cat!

2230
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:13,290
Heart cat, come here!

2231
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:13,750
Come here, heart cat!

2232
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:20,690
Oh my gosh.

2233
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:21,370
Go away.

2234
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:26,610
Banana!

2235
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:29,230
Nana!

2236
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:31,650
Where's the heart cat?

2237
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:33,450
I'm just gonna wait, I'm just gonna wait.

2238
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:34,150
Okay, okay, okay.

2239
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:35,350
Come here, come here, heart cat.

2240
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:35,930
Come here, heart cat.

2241
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:37,470
Two heart cats!

2242
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:38,030
Two heart cats!

2243
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:38,350
Come here!

2244
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:38,910
Oh!

2245
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:39,530
Two heart!

2246
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:41,310
No!

2247
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:43,110
Come here!

2248
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:44,250
Yes.

2249
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:47,950
Yes.

2250
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:48,630
Okay.

2251
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:50,690
We'll keep collecting hearts, you guys.

2252
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:51,430
I'm not gonna die.

2253
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:52,570
I refuse.

2254
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:54,010
I refuse.

2255
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,530
Come here, heart cat.

2256
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:57,670
Hey!

2257
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,390
Why are there so many coin cats?

2258
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:06,610
Oh, wait.

2259
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:08,690
I can't wait for too long, because I'm gonna get hot.

2260
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:11,030
Okay, I'm just gonna go for it, then.

2261
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:16,130
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2262
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:17,170
Hey!

2263
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:19,750
Okay, I got it anyway.

2264
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:21,030
Nice, nice, nice.

2265
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:22,370
Wait, where's my checkpoint?

2266
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:24,030
Didn't I get a checkpoint on the couch?

2267
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:28,270
Didn't I get a couch checkpoint?

2268
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:28,750
Or no?

2269
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:30,710
Didn't I?

2270
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,170
I thought I did.

2271
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,050
What happened?

2272
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:37,870
Yellow one on the left?

2273
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:38,670
Huh?

2274
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:39,910
Huh?

2275
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:42,910
No, I didn't...

2276
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:49,500
I thought I reached it.

2277
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,820
Sorry, I got... I didn't know which one to do.

2278
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:05,180
This one.

2279
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:05,520
Okay.

2280
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,420
I know I kinda did it backwards, but that's okay.

2281
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:09,900
It's fine.

2282
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,500
Okay.

2283
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:11,500
Alright.

2284
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:14,680
Okay.

2285
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:15,660
Okay.

2286
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:16,780
Yeah!

2287
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:21,720
Yaaaaah!

2288
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:24,720
Fine,

2289
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:34,740
I'll just use you.

2290
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,980
The fire is so mean.

2291
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:38,720
I know!

2292
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,960
I shouldn't even exist!

2293
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:41,920
I shouldn't!

2294
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,400
Okay.

2295
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:46,140
You... you can avoid the fire.

2296
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:46,460
You can.

2297
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:46,880
How?

2298
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,340
I don't...

2299
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:50,220
I don't know.

2300
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,620
How am I supposed to avoid that?

2301
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,800
How am I supposed to avoid that?

2302
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,420
I don't know what hit me, but whatever.

2303
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:09,160
Okay.

2304
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:16,850
Okay, we made it, we made it, we made it.

2305
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:17,530
Okay, here we go.

2306
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,000
Okay.

2307
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:25,480
And there's healthier.

2308
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,080
Yeah!

2309
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,420
Okay.

2310
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:34,020
Oh.

2311
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,080
Okay.

2312
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:40,720
All right.

2313
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,520
All right.

2314
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,380
I'm gonna try again.

2315
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,380
Oh my gosh.

2316
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:54,470
Okay, okay, okay.

2317
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:55,970
Okay.

2318
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:01,320
I can read.

2319
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,320
I know what it just says.

2320
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:07,940
What if I just jump through?

2321
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:10,740
What if I just jump through, you guys?

2322
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,300
Oh, jeez.

2323
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,660
Oh, jeez.

2324
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,640
I should have just jumped.

2325
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:18,520
I forgot he walks over there.

2326
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,720
It's okay, it's okay.

2327
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:21,380
Oh, ouch.

2328
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,380
Not bad.

2329
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:27,540
Ouch.

2330
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:28,080
Ouch.

2331
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:28,840
Ouch, real.

2332
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:30,500
Hoi!

2333
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:31,260
Hoi!

2334
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:40,380
Oh, here he comes, here he comes.

2335
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:42,800
Oh, here he comes, here he comes.

2336
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:48,800
My depth perception!

2337
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:49,260
My depth perception!

2338
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,540
You guys, I don't think I can do that with my depth perception, okay?

2339
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:54,820
You guys, I don't think I can do that with my depth perception, okay?

2340
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:55,940
I'll be honest.

2341
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:56,280
I'll be honest.

2342
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:58,320
This is a sin game, right?

2343
01:45:59,240 --> 01:45:59,880
Sin game.

2344
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,160
Oh, ouch.

2345
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:03,860
Just go?

2346
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:04,400
Okay.

2347
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,460
I'm just gonna go.

2348
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,140
I gotta go fast.

2349
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:06,880
I'm gonna go fast, okay.

2350
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:08,200
We're gonna go fast, we're gonna go fast.

2351
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:12,800
Okay we're gonna go fast, we're gonna go fast, we're gonna go fast.

2352
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:15,580
No!

2353
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,520
Okay, hold on.

2354
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,200
We gotta wait for him.

2355
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:27,220
Oh my gosh!

2356
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:29,000
Please stop touching me!

2357
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:31,640
Oh my god.

2358
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,040
Guys, that was not good.

2359
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:38,040
Okay, I have an idea.

2360
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:38,620
I have an idea.

2361
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,060
Never mind.

2362
01:46:57,730 --> 01:46:58,990
Stop between the hammers.

2363
01:46:58,990 --> 01:47:00,530
That's what I'm saying, my depth perception.

2364
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:01,590
I don't think I can.

2365
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:12,610
Yeah, I know my health is low.

2366
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:13,510
I know.

2367
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:20,520
If I change like this, maybe?

2368
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,040
Oh gosh.

2369
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:31,540
Okay, let's health cat.

2370
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:32,940
Health cat!

2371
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:34,720
It's octopus!

2372
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:35,940
Oh my gosh.

2373
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:37,800
You guys, we almost just died for real.

2374
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,240
Oh, please, please, please, health cat!

2375
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,000
Yes!

2376
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,280
I'm stuck.

2377
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:50,460
Okay.

2378
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:54,660
Okay, okay.

2379
01:47:58,090 --> 01:47:59,570
Good thing there was a health cat there.

2380
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:02,110
Okay!

2381
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:04,550
One more time!

2382
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:06,930
Okay.

2383
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,650
I can't, I can't align!

2384
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:15,590
I can't align!

2385
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:32,810
Health cat!

2386
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:34,550
Health cat.

2387
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:37,210
We'll wait for one.

2388
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:43,270
I think that's a health cat over there, but it looks like he has coins.

2389
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:45,910
And he's also gone.

2390
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:49,950
Maybe he's just gotta run it?

2391
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:50,350
I don't...

2392
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:53,370
I don't think so.

2393
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:54,010
I don't know.

2394
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:54,970
Health cat, come here!

2395
01:48:55,570 --> 01:48:56,630
No coin cat!

2396
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:58,250
No coin cat!

2397
01:48:58,270 --> 01:48:58,910
No coin cat!

2398
01:48:59,050 --> 01:48:59,990
No coin cat!

2399
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,840
Any health cats in chat?

2400
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,940
That's one warm drink.

2401
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:19,660
Yeah, it's getting pretty toasty.

2402
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:23,280
How is it so warm?

2403
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:26,260
What degrees does this guy have his apartment at?

2404
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:29,920
I'm too afraid to go over there, because I'll get killed by the octopus.

2405
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:30,740
I know I will.

2406
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:31,420
Come here!

2407
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:31,880
Come here!

2408
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:36,800
Okay.

2409
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:37,860
All right, all right, all right.

2410
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:38,720
Fight!

2411
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:42,580
It's giving me, like, stats.

2412
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,460
Thank you, snake.

2413
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:46,760
Oh

2414
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:58,290
no, I have to hurry again?

2415
01:49:59,070 --> 01:49:59,450
Okay.

2416
01:49:59,870 --> 01:50:00,250
Okay.

2417
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:05,310
Okay.

2418
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:09,130
This is so unfair.

2419
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:25,870
This guy!

2420
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:26,910
This guy!

2421
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:28,370
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

2422
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:29,470
I'm just gonna jump for it again.

2423
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:30,050
I'm gonna go.

2424
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:30,910
I'm gonna run for it.

2425
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:33,790
Never mind.

2426
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:36,070
I'm about to die again.

2427
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:38,230
Oh, guys.

2428
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:39,450
Oh, guys.

2429
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:40,310
Oh, guys.

2430
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:43,690
If I don't get a health cat, this is it.

2431
01:50:43,730 --> 01:50:44,310
This is it.

2432
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:46,910
Oh.

2433
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:49,050
Fight!

2434
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:51,670
Oh, come on.

2435
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:52,310
Fight!

2436
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:53,090
No!

2437
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:53,470
Why

2438
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,600
are the health cats so few and far between?

2439
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,060
Why are there not... there's not enough health cats.

2440
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:05,980
Oh.

2441
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:09,900
Fight!

2442
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:22,970
It's that guy's heals.

2443
01:51:27,090 --> 01:51:32,290
The guy's heals keep hitting me, so I gotta, like, actually not go when he's around.

2444
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:36,070
I hope the devs of this game aren't gonna make a War of Calamity.

2445
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,570
No, I'm actually having fun.

2446
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:39,590
It's just a little tricky.

2447
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:42,330
Tricky doesn't mean bad, right?

2448
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:43,570
Yeah.

2449
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:45,990
Woo!

2450
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,290
Oh, crap.

2451
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:47,470
Okay, here he comes.

2452
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:47,810
Oh.

2453
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:49,650
Gosh.

2454
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:53,530
Oh.

2455
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:54,110
Argh!

2456
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:54,830
I didn't move!

2457
01:51:55,070 --> 01:51:56,610
I didn't!

2458
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,190
I didn't move.

2459
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:02,250
And he's still hitting me.

2460
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:03,250
Oh.

2461
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:03,710
Oh.

2462
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:06,330
Oh.

2463
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:08,270
I didn't even move.

2464
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:09,650
I didn't even move.

2465
01:52:09,770 --> 01:52:11,070
But he went past me.

2466
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:13,470
And then he went past me again and hit me.

2467
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:14,570
How does that make any...

2468
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:15,510
Saint!!

2469
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:18,250
Oh my god!

2470
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:19,270
Oh my god!

2471
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:20,010
Health Cat!

2472
01:52:20,670 --> 01:52:21,370
Health Cat!

2473
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:22,990
Health Cat!

2474
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:23,710
Health Cat!

2475
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:34,670
We're at 25 degrees.

2476
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:39,230
This guy is pro... 26!

2477
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:41,690
This guy is gaming in the midsummer.

2478
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:44,430
Minto's depth perception.

2479
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:46,470
I'm telling you, I don't have good depth perception!

2480
01:52:51,730 --> 01:52:52,690
I don't!

2481
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:54,270
That's always been my enemy!

2482
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:57,870
I'm gonna wait for him to leave.

2483
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:09,530
I'm gonna wait for him to leave.

2484
01:53:10,170 --> 01:53:13,610
I wonder how far we can go, you know?

2485
01:53:13,650 --> 01:53:14,730
How hot we can go.

2486
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:18,810
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

2487
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,990
How hot can we go?

2488
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:21,990
Oh!

2489
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:23,130
Ah!

2490
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:26,430
I

2491
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:37,220
was fine until you... until the dragon...

2492
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:38,860
Fuck it, I'm just gonna keep going.

2493
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:46,580
No!

2494
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:46,980
Wait!

2495
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:47,760
No, no!

2496
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:48,620
No, no!

2497
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,980
I panicked because the guy was coming back.

2498
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:58,040
H-O-T-T-O...

2499
01:53:58,540 --> 01:53:59,320
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

2500
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:02,900
How hot can we go?

2501
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:05,320
It's gotta be like 30 degrees, probably.

2502
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:08,140
I get it, Snake.

2503
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:08,700
I get it.

2504
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:13,810
Oh!

2505
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:26,660
Hahahaha!

2506
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:27,860
Hahahaha!

2507
01:54:41,790 --> 01:54:42,670
It's not...

2508
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:46,110
I think I got hit by the fire.

2509
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:52,410
Oi moi!

2510
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:53,350
No, it's your birthday!

2511
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:57,170
Is it actually Ducky's birthday too?

2512
01:54:58,230 --> 01:54:58,890
Oh, wait.

2513
01:54:58,990 --> 01:54:59,530
I'm confused.

2514
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:01,550
Why are you guys in cahoots with each other?

2515
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:07,230
Happy birthday to you.

2516
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:11,910
Happy birthday to you.

2517
01:55:12,090 --> 01:55:16,390
Happy birthday oi moi Ducky.

2518
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:26,510
Happy birthday to you.

2519
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:27,610
Woo!

2520
01:55:27,610 --> 01:55:28,450
Woo!

2521
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:30,390
Oh!

2522
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:37,600
Unfair.

2523
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:38,520
Unfair.

2524
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:39,060
Unfair.

2525
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,380
Unfair.

2526
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:41,440
Unfair.

2527
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:42,680
I called cheat.

2528
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:44,180
I called cheating.

2529
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,640
Cheater.

2530
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:46,140
Cheater.

2531
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:46,780
Popkinator.

2532
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:49,100
The game is cheating.

2533
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:50,900
Oh!

2534
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,060
Oh, actually that... that one helped me.

2535
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:03,860
Okay.

2536
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:09,600
Did you beat all of them?

2537
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:11,320
Yeah, I did.

2538
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:12,860
Looks like the bug problem has been solved.

2539
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:14,000
Ah!

2540
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:19,900
Boing!

2541
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:29,420
H-O-T-T-O-G-O How high can we go?

2542
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:31,280
Woop!

2543
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,460
Boop-boop!

2544
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:32,980
Woop!

2545
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:33,680
Oh!

2546
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,700
Wait, I'm silly.

2547
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,740
Wait, I'm silly.

2548
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:38,400
There we go.

2549
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:40,160
Hah!

2550
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:40,780
Hot!

2551
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:41,840
Hot!

2552
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:42,560
Hot!

2553
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:48,700
This game is so... it feels so summer, but...

2554
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:58,320
Part of the reason I'm like a little... a little crazy cookie is right before stream I had a...

2555
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,280
Oh!

2556
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,180
Oh!

2557
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:01,860
Oh, the cat's not that close.

2558
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,260
I had a coffee.

2559
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,980
And I went and got a pumpkin coffee.

2560
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:08,380
Because I'm so excited for pumpkin fall.

2561
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:09,280
I know.

2562
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,880
I should have had a calorie mate drink.

2563
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:15,400
Maybe I'm being punished.

2564
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:19,520
I'm being punished for not having had a calorie mate drink.

2565
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:26,100
Now I know I need to like...

2566
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:29,160
Go back here.

2567
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:32,360
But what's wrong with sequence breaking and avoiding...

2568
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:32,740
Oh!

2569
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:33,180
Dang it!

2570
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:33,760
I didn't...

2571
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,460
I have to remember the little damn puppets.

2572
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,300
These stupid plushies.

2573
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:42,860
I forget they're there because I can jump here, you know?

2574
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:44,640
Okay.

2575
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:50,540
Ah!

2576
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:59,000
The dragon flames is so unfair.

2577
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:02,340
I think after a certain point, you shouldn't have to deal with it anymore.

2578
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:04,040
That's just me.

2579
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,280
That's just my thinking.

2580
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:10,840
Like here?

2581
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:12,720
Like that's...

2582
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:13,520
That's a little...

2583
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:14,580
That's a little rough.

2584
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:17,680
Okay.

2585
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:20,960
I think he's gonna get me again.

2586
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:21,800
So I gotta jump.

2587
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:22,500
Okay.

2588
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:25,040
And...

2589
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:26,880
Oh!

2590
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:27,640
Okay.

2591
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:28,480
Ha!

2592
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:30,400
Nice suit!

2593
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:35,340
Oh!

2594
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:35,640
I...

2595
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,000
I got hurt.

2596
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:37,120
I...

2597
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:37,300
Wait.

2598
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:37,680
It's okay.

2599
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:39,380
Okay.

2600
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:42,900
Speed thrill.

2601
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:44,240
But we...

2602
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:45,300
I got the strat, though.

2603
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:45,860
I got the strat.

2604
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:52,040
It took me some time, but I have the strat for this part.

2605
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:55,020
I just gotta go as a tall man.

2606
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,040
Oh!

2607
01:58:59,540 --> 01:58:59,940
Yeah!

2608
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,000
Okay.

2609
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:01,960
Oh, gosh.

2610
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:02,460
Here he comes.

2611
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:03,480
Wait.

2612
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:15,140
Oh!

2613
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:17,720
Oh, no!

2614
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:17,820
Oh.

2615
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:18,240
What hurt me.

2616
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:18,900
What hurt me!

2617
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:20,280
What hurt me!

2618
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:22,280
Okay.

2619
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:28,650
Yeah!

2620
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:35,250
It was so...

2621
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:36,710
In the end, it was so easy!

2622
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:38,150
It pisses me off!

2623
01:59:38,570 --> 01:59:40,150
In the end, it was so easy.

2624
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:41,370
It makes me angry.

2625
01:59:41,670 --> 01:59:43,070
How much I could avoid!

2626
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:45,310
In the end, it was so...

2627
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:47,410
It was so easy!

2628
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,550
It was so easy.

2629
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:52,030
In the end I like sped right in front of you!

2630
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:55,170
I got a B?

2631
01:59:56,810 --> 01:59:57,710
I got a B!

2632
01:59:57,870 --> 01:59:58,690
Oh see my time!

2633
01:59:58,990 --> 01:59:59,810
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2634
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:03,050
Look!

2635
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:04,690
I got an S on my time!

2636
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:07,870
And my temperature!

2637
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:12,390
Oh my gosh!

2638
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:17,950
What's the second one here?

2639
02:00:17,950 --> 02:00:18,930
Robot?

2640
02:00:19,150 --> 02:00:19,670
Face?

2641
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:20,750
What is that?

2642
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,290
Speedrun that's my time baby!

2643
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:28,890
S for slow.

2644
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:36,410
I almost spelled sad.

2645
02:00:41,810 --> 02:00:43,370
Oh robots are the bugs.

2646
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:45,790
Oh so since I only killed 7 I got a D.

2647
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:53,450
Wait world ranking...

2648
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:54,790
I'm below a thousand.

2649
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:57,410
The world record is 53 seconds?

2650
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:58,310
That is... how?

2651
02:00:59,030 --> 02:00:59,590
How?

2652
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:00,550
That's the... how?

2653
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:01,850
That does not even seem possible.

2654
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:04,190
She was purposefully throwing.

2655
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,210
How is that the...

2656
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:07,830
How?

2657
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:10,050
How?

2658
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,140
Look up a video?

2659
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,480
Hold on let's go back to the title.

2660
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,140
Does it show the...

2661
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,240
Oh.

2662
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,020
Wait what's the balloon jump?

2663
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:28,320
I didn't even see any balloons.

2664
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:34,940
What is the balloon jump?

2665
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,460
We didn't even get to try the balloon jump.

2666
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:41,000
Because...

2667
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,120
What does it mean by that?

2668
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,800
In the first part...

2669
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:51,160
Okay as much as I love you.

2670
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,120
Otsuka Akkyo.

2671
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:53,900
I'm a liquid.

2672
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:55,420
Calorie made liquid.

2673
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:56,680
It's going to be a busy day.

2674
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:00,840
Oh my god his voice is smooth as butter.

2675
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:04,700
Okay balloon jump.

2676
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,480
Oh is it that?

2677
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:10,680
Oh I think I see it.

2678
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:13,280
Oh sorry I was so...

2679
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:14,500
I'm conditioned to...

2680
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,780
There's a balloon up there!

2681
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,560
I think that's it.

2682
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:16,800
Okay.

2683
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:31,300
Tentsudaya.

2684
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:33,900
Oh my god he sounds so good.

2685
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,420
I tried it.

2686
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:42,120
I tried the balloon jump.

2687
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,000
Where's my achievement?

2688
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:45,700
I tried it.

2689
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:46,640
I tried to do it.

2690
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:47,480
Where's my achievement?

2691
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:51,420
I tried it.

2692
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,440
I tried it.

2693
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,300
Where's my achievement?

2694
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,560
How far back do you think we need to be?

2695
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:01,480
Like here?

2696
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:10,480
There's a calorie made up there.

2697
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,460
There's a calorie made up there.

2698
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,860
Do I... maybe I go through here?

2699
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:27,120
Do I...

2700
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:27,120
maybe I go through here?

2701
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:36,820
Dio?

2702
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:39,180
No Dio is Norio Wakamoto, isn't it?

2703
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:39,300
Dio?

2704
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:39,300
No Dio is Norio Wakamoto, isn't it?

2705
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,580
Dio is someone different.

2706
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:44,460
I see.

2707
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:47,620
Ta-da!

2708
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:53,340
Koyasu?

2709
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:54,100
Oh.

2710
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,160
Why did I think it was Norio Wakamoto?

2711
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,020
Takehito Koyasu.

2712
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:00,880
Oh just kidding.

2713
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,300
I attempted.

2714
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:06,600
Do you think I could get that too?

2715
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:07,960
I don't even know how.

2716
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,800
Um.

2717
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:10,460
I'm not here to try.

2718
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:11,460
I'm gonna try all the... here.

2719
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:16,980
Sounds so cool.

2720
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:18,580
Do you think I can go in here?

2721
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:22,280
Where's my achievement for being in here?

2722
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:24,180
Where's my achievement for being in here?

2723
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:25,540
Beep.

2724
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:26,420
Boop boop.

2725
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,960
Oh is that how you get out?

2726
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,280
Oh my god I'm smelling his feet.

2727
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:33,200
Oh yeah.

2728
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:35,020
Wait.

2729
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:37,820
This should be...

2730
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:40,180
Not.

2731
02:04:40,540 --> 02:04:41,100
Stinky shoes.

2732
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:44,620
Uh.

2733
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:45,300
I'm stuck.

2734
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:47,000
I'm stuck in here.

2735
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:49,140
Why?

2736
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:50,160
Why?

2737
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:51,300
Why?

2738
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:52,100
Why?

2739
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,220
Wait is there another balloon?

2740
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:55,740
Oh no.

2741
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:56,320
That's a...

2742
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,640
What is that?

2743
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:00,860
Oh there's another.

2744
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:01,800
There's a second balloon.

2745
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:05,780
Wait how does...

2746
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,780
How does Miku say it?

2747
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,460
Oh wait I have to change the can.

2748
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:11,880
That's right.

2749
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:14,040
How does she say it I wonder?

2750
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:15,620
That's the same balloon?

2751
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:16,740
Oh did I hit it over there?

2752
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:17,100
My bad.

2753
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,420
I'm liquid.

2754
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:20,680
I'm liquid.

2755
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:21,420
I'm liquid.

2756
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:23,280
Calorie mate liquid.

2757
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:24,940
Yogurt flavored.

2758
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,480
Yogurt flavored.

2759
02:05:31,540 --> 02:05:32,320
Yogurt flavored.

2760
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:33,560
So cute.

2761
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:33,760
So cute.

2762
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,620
So cute.

2763
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:43,620
You know as much as I love Oscar Akio.

2764
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:47,260
Kind of sick of listening to old men.

2765
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:52,980
My ears are refreshed.

2766
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:01,820
My ears are refreshed.

2767
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:03,540
My ears are refreshed.

2768
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:06,840
Honestly though all the seiyuu they chose for this are...

2769
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:07,940
Perfection.

2770
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:15,960
I saw... I saw...

2771
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,400
Miku Ito recently.

2772
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:22,640
Even the English one?

2773
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:26,140
Even the English one?

2774
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:34,460
I wanna see what she says.

2775
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,260
I wanna see what she says.

2776
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:40,360
I wanna see what she says.

2777
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:47,200
My ears are refreshed, my ears are refreshed.

2778
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,540
I wanna see what she says.

2779
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:49,540
I wanna see what she says.

2780
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,280
I feel so hot.

2781
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:53,240
I really do.

2782
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:53,940
How cute.

2783
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:54,300
So cute.

2784
02:06:57,880 --> 02:06:59,520
Yeah like...

2785
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,220
Boring...

2786
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:06,240
It's just...

2787
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:12,300
Oh, they respond!

2788
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:16,300
In the Japanese version, they resp... they respond!

2789
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,780
Oh my gosh.

2790
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:31,340
No way.

2791
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:42,160
Oh, because it's voiced by... oh my gosh, it's voiced by the guy, so it's... so it's the brother.

2792
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,680
Wait, she's so cute!

2793
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:57,520
She's so cute!

2794
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:01,780
Not goal, Guru!

2795
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,220
Makes me wanna say Guru after everything.

2796
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,460
Pan fry the calorie mitt.

2797
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,000
Yeah, I'll drink you.

2798
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:19,900
I'll drink you up!

2799
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:26,280
Now we're nice and hidden.

2800
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,940
Aww, she sounds so sweet!

2801
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,000
She's so cute!

2802
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:37,760
Well guys, this is fun.

2803
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:39,380
This is a game for sure.

2804
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:47,060
This is a game for sure, huh?

2805
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,660
Cute girl.

2806
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:49,600
I know, cute girl.

2807
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:56,120
I wanna see if they all have... you know how, like, the other cans responded?

2808
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:58,260
I wanna see if that also happens in this one.

2809
02:08:58,520 --> 02:08:59,200
I'm a liquid!

2810
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:00,640
I'm a liquid!

2811
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:01,440
I'm a liquid!

2812
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,100
Come on, let's go!

2813
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:10,600
We didn't get a matasedana or a... or a issensu da, but we did get...

2814
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:12,060
A liquid!

2815
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:17,320
Which to me was also kinda worth it.

2816
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:19,620
We did get that.

2817
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,940
Which was pretty worth it to me.

2818
02:09:27,110 --> 02:09:28,510
Banana and an apple.

2819
02:09:28,890 --> 02:09:31,630
Why does he say it so sensual?

2820
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:33,810
Oh, yogurt flavor.

2821
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:34,290
How are you?

2822
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:41,630
What about this one?

2823
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:46,930
Oh, I didn't think of that.

2824
02:09:46,930 --> 02:09:51,070
According to the information, the game creator's goal is to...

2825
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:53,070
Oh, cafe au lait flavor.

2826
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:54,130
How are you?

2827
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:03,270
There's not one for him though.

2828
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:03,790
It's up there.

2829
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:06,490
How will we even get up there?

2830
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:08,350
Okay guys, we have to... this is our goal.

2831
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:10,110
We have to figure out how to get up there.

2832
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:12,770
Because then we can talk to his own kind.

2833
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:14,870
How do we get up there?

2834
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:18,370
Maybe it needs to be their flavor?

2835
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:19,110
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

2836
02:10:19,890 --> 02:10:20,290
How?

2837
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:22,790
How do we...

2838
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:25,770
climb the utensils?

2839
02:10:25,890 --> 02:10:26,530
Oh, okay, okay.

2840
02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:28,470
Oh, I don't know.

2841
02:10:28,530 --> 02:10:29,910
I just left the...

2842
02:10:30,390 --> 02:10:32,070
I just left that area for some reason.

2843
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:33,690
I just wanted to look around.

2844
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:34,050
Okay.

2845
02:10:35,890 --> 02:10:37,490
I think I can go from here.

2846
02:10:37,690 --> 02:10:38,710
Like I can reach it.

2847
02:10:38,710 --> 02:10:40,030
Oh, I see what you mean.

2848
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:40,610
I see what you mean.

2849
02:10:42,010 --> 02:10:42,490
Dang it.

2850
02:10:51,630 --> 02:10:51,990
Balloon?

2851
02:10:52,030 --> 02:10:52,850
We already did the balloon.

2852
02:10:53,850 --> 02:10:54,950
I'm too good at this game.

2853
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:56,390
Clearly.

2854
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:01,550
Clearly, I'm too good at this game.

2855
02:11:05,650 --> 02:11:06,010
Clearly.

2856
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:06,750
Oh.

2857
02:11:07,230 --> 02:11:07,290
Oh.

2858
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:08,030
Okay.

2859
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:09,330
I'm done being cocky.

2860
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:09,710
I'm sorry.

2861
02:11:10,650 --> 02:11:11,370
I'm sorry.

2862
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:12,630
I'm done being cocky.

2863
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:13,050
I'm done.

2864
02:11:13,170 --> 02:11:13,510
I'm done.

2865
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:17,250
I'm done.

2866
02:11:17,330 --> 02:11:17,670
I'm done.

2867
02:11:17,790 --> 02:11:18,090
I'm done.

2868
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:22,710
This has got to be also a challenge though.

2869
02:11:22,790 --> 02:11:23,810
To meet the green one.

2870
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:27,210
You know?

2871
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:30,130
It doesn't suit you?

2872
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:30,390
What?

2873
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:31,010
Being cocky?

2874
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:32,810
What are you talking about?

2875
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:34,990
Oh.

2876
02:11:35,150 --> 02:11:35,670
Hey,

2877
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:42,130
what does he say here?

2878
02:11:45,710 --> 02:11:46,230
Oh.

2879
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:51,290
Are you guys sure about this?

2880
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:53,390
Okay.

2881
02:11:57,750 --> 02:11:58,270
Oh.

2882
02:11:58,430 --> 02:12:00,330
This might be the real final boss.

2883
02:12:00,570 --> 02:12:01,330
Oh my gosh.

2884
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:03,170
If I could see anything.

2885
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:06,230
The last thing you need to do with the creator is nutrition.

2886
02:12:14,710 --> 02:12:20,920
The five nutrients.

2887
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:25,500
Protein, fat, sugar, vitamin, and minerals.

2888
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:28,800
Take these five nutrients in a balanced way.

2889
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:37,060
What did I say?

2890
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:42,280
Okay, okay, okay.

2891
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:45,640
Oh, please.

2892
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:46,900
Please, please.

2893
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:48,040
You're in the way.

2894
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,080
You're in the way.

2895
02:12:54,220 --> 02:12:56,140
I think I have to turn sideways there.

2896
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:00,880
Probably.

2897
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:08,690
Liquid!

2898
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:13,910
The microwave hallway?

2899
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:14,610
But it's...

2900
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:16,410
Where do you guys see a microwave at?

2901
02:13:17,290 --> 02:13:19,090
Where do you guys see a microwave at?

2902
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:22,370
There's no microwave here?

2903
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:31,470
Oh, above the fridge?

2904
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:37,730
Oh my gosh.

2905
02:13:38,330 --> 02:13:39,690
I could just get here more easily.

2906
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:43,110
Oh my gosh!

2907
02:13:43,390 --> 02:13:45,030
It actually slides you off.

2908
02:13:45,090 --> 02:13:45,690
It's so slippery.

2909
02:13:49,870 --> 02:13:51,230
There's like a physics here.

2910
02:13:51,350 --> 02:13:52,210
See how I'm sliding?

2911
02:13:55,850 --> 02:13:57,670
I can't get the momentum!

2912
02:13:58,310 --> 02:13:59,350
Oh, I was on it!

2913
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:01,390
Okay.

2914
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:15,400
How do you think I can get here?

2915
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,740
Oh, I wonder if I can go the other way, maybe.

2916
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:20,820
From the microwave, right?

2917
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:25,580
Like if I go from the table to the air con... or the... the... that?

2918
02:14:38,930 --> 02:14:40,290
This is important to me.

2919
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:41,590
Okay, I'm gonna try over there.

2920
02:14:44,570 --> 02:14:45,370
So close.

2921
02:14:45,530 --> 02:14:45,830
I know.

2922
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:45,910
No.

2923
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:46,830
Liquid.

2924
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:53,190
You're not liquid, though.

2925
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:54,290
You're sorry, though.

2926
02:14:54,450 --> 02:14:57,430
Actually, I don't know who does the voice of liquid in Japanese.

2927
02:14:58,370 --> 02:14:59,170
Oh, no.

2928
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:00,330
I don't think I can go this way.

2929
02:15:04,370 --> 02:15:04,810
No!

2930
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:11,090
Oh, get on...

2931
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:12,470
Well, I tried earlier.

2932
02:15:13,130 --> 02:15:14,550
It's a bit tricky.

2933
02:15:14,730 --> 02:15:15,750
I'd have to maneuver.

2934
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:16,670
Let me see.

2935
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,760
Because, like, there's...

2936
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:26,780
Why is everything... Why am I so slippery now?

2937
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:28,580
Is it because I went in the pan?

2938
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,980
Ah, behind!

2939
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:35,600
You guys are so smart.

2940
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:38,420
What would I do without you?

2941
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:43,880
No!

2942
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:44,720
Okay.

2943
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:48,800
Slippery snake.

2944
02:16:09,550 --> 02:16:11,570
I have a feeling that I have the answer!

2945
02:16:11,570 --> 02:16:13,090
I can't... I can't...

2946
02:16:13,090 --> 02:16:13,890
Oh, gosh.

2947
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:15,590
I have 11 kinds of vitamins.

2948
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:18,350
Half of them are necessary for the whole day.

2949
02:16:19,010 --> 02:16:19,530
Wait.

2950
02:16:19,570 --> 02:16:19,630
Oh.

2951
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:27,750
Why does it feel easier from the start?

2952
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:28,870
This is the other side than this side.

2953
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:32,670
Yeah, I got to roll it for sure.

2954
02:16:44,390 --> 02:16:47,670
Okay, at least it's easier to get back on.

2955
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,780
Oh my gosh, I can actually see outside.

2956
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:58,440
I'm stuck.

2957
02:16:58,600 --> 02:16:58,920
Wait.

2958
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:00,200
Okay, there we go.

2959
02:17:08,370 --> 02:17:09,610
Why is this so tricky?

2960
02:17:13,010 --> 02:17:17,170
Why is this so tricky?

2961
02:17:19,470 --> 02:17:21,190
It's either... Oh my gosh.

2962
02:17:22,130 --> 02:17:29,230
It's either having an easier time getting up here and being able to attempt the jump or having an easier jump.

2963
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:36,970
I want to just try a little bit more.

2964
02:17:37,110 --> 02:17:38,350
A little bit more, you guys.

2965
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:38,910
A little bit more.

2966
02:17:43,410 --> 02:17:51,350
A little bit more.

2967
02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:59,450
If the camera angle also wasn't so awful...

2968
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:03,770
If the camera angle also wasn't so awful...

2969
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:05,450
It is really tricky.

2970
02:18:06,930 --> 02:18:09,690
The door blocks it, but the door blocks it on the other side too.

2971
02:18:11,430 --> 02:18:16,750
According to the information, some game creators sometimes don't understand why they have to do this.

2972
02:18:22,790 --> 02:18:23,910
So close.

2973
02:18:25,290 --> 02:18:26,290
Okay, jumping earlier.

2974
02:18:26,570 --> 02:18:27,690
Jumping earlier, everybody.

2975
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:29,270
Oops.

2976
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:30,470
Jumping earlier.

2977
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:31,210
Jumping earlier.

2978
02:18:31,690 --> 02:18:32,510
Okay, okay, okay.

2979
02:18:35,130 --> 02:18:36,270
This shit looks impossible.

2980
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:36,910
It's not.

2981
02:18:38,830 --> 02:18:41,570
But I keep hitting the... I keep hitting the cabinet.

2982
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:44,450
I keep hitting the cabinet.

2983
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:51,470
I keep hitting that corner.

2984
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:54,710
I

2985
02:19:00,690 --> 02:19:01,850
didn't jump soon enough.

2986
02:19:03,990 --> 02:19:05,050
Sorry, guys.

2987
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:05,770
I'm stubborn.

2988
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:08,150
I'm stubborn.

2989
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:10,990
I'll run to the game creator as soon as possible.

2990
02:19:11,890 --> 02:19:18,270
Oh, how are you doing, comrades?

2991
02:19:19,890 --> 02:19:21,350
No problem.

2992
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:29,590
No problem.

2993
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:33,310
They sounded so cute.

2994
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:34,810
Yippee.

2995
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:37,570
Even if my nutrition is not balanced, it is not good to skip meals.

2996
02:19:38,190 --> 02:19:41,070
I am king of the kitchen.

2997
02:19:45,810 --> 02:19:46,930
Oh, sorry.

2998
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:47,650
I'm blocking it.

2999
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:49,790
My bad.

3000
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:52,030
I forgot to move out of the way.

3001
02:19:52,230 --> 02:19:53,630
I'm so sorry, you guys.

3002
02:19:55,310 --> 02:20:01,390
What kind of game are you making, game creator?

3003
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:03,910
Okay, one last thing now.

3004
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:06,330
One last thing now.

3005
02:20:06,330 --> 02:20:07,490
One last thing now.

3006
02:20:07,490 --> 02:20:08,330
One last thing now.

3007
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:08,910
I'm Liquid.

3008
02:20:09,210 --> 02:20:10,430
I'm Liquid.

3009
02:20:10,810 --> 02:20:11,110
I'm Liquid.

3010
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:11,770
It's going to be a busy day.

3011
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:15,790
We now have to hear what he sounds like when he meets his buddies.

3012
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:16,810
I'll move slowly.

3013
02:20:17,990 --> 02:20:18,850
Oh, wrong way.

3014
02:20:20,290 --> 02:20:21,150
Which is easy.

3015
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:22,370
We can get there very easily.

3016
02:20:22,390 --> 02:20:22,990
Let's get started.

3017
02:20:25,290 --> 02:20:29,670
Today's mission is to deliver balanced nutrition to the game creator in the northeast of this 2DK.

3018
02:20:32,170 --> 02:20:33,270
You sound so good.

3019
02:20:34,150 --> 02:20:37,130
The goal of the game creator is to dominate the game.

3020
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:38,330
His meals tend to be irregular.

3021
02:20:38,930 --> 02:20:40,110
You sound so good.

3022
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:40,490
Okay.

3023
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,470
Hoi.

3024
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:43,110
Hoi.

3025
02:20:45,650 --> 02:20:46,090
Hoi.

3026
02:20:46,830 --> 02:20:47,270
Hoi.

3027
02:20:47,570 --> 02:20:48,010
Hoi.

3028
02:20:48,770 --> 02:20:49,210
Hoi.

3029
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:50,110
Hoi.

3030
02:20:50,110 --> 02:20:50,230
Hoi.

3031
02:20:51,410 --> 02:20:54,040
All right.

3032
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:55,580
His buddies are over there.

3033
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:56,780
Bananas and apples.

3034
02:20:58,120 --> 02:20:58,720
Bananas and apples.

3035
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:00,060
Hoi.

3036
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:05,920
Young women age into old men.

3037
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:06,960
What are you talking about?

3038
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:07,520
You are talking about me.

3039
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:09,360
Yo.

3040
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:10,340
What's up?

3041
02:21:11,700 --> 02:21:12,560
Bocchi bocchi.

3042
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:15,240
Bocchi bocchi.

3043
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:18,000
Bocchi bocchi.

3044
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:18,860
Bocchi bocchi.

3045
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:19,680
Okay.

3046
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:20,780
I feel satisfied now.

3047
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:23,060
I feel satisfied.

3048
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:23,880
I feel satisfied.

3049
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:24,940
Bocchi bocchi.

3050
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:28,200
Wait, hold on.

3051
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:30,120
I don't want to see what the other...

3052
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:30,280
Oh.

3053
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:34,540
What are the other things?

3054
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:36,940
I didn't expect this to be a rage game and I'm not going to play it again.

3055
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:38,800
I didn't expect to have the Mecha Musume Miku.

3056
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:39,780
Great job rolling tonight.

3057
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:40,300
Thanks!

3058
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:40,740
Me neither!

3059
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:41,820
That was so awesome!

3060
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:44,120
Jumping professional.

3061
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:45,300
Try jumping the balloon.

3062
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:46,940
Wait, how do I get...

3063
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:48,640
How do I show... How do I... Oh!

3064
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:49,480
Oh, here we go.

3065
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:49,660
Okay.

3066
02:21:50,380 --> 02:21:52,220
Try touching the giant creature.

3067
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:53,420
Oh, that's the cat.

3068
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:56,900
Touch the box of plastic models.

3069
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:58,020
Wait, there's...

3070
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:03,260
According to data, many creators have been asked this question by their guardians.

3071
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:06,060
Did you buy the same kind of model kit again?

3072
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:09,280
Creators who dislike cats don't exist?

3073
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:15,000
We, Liquid, support creators who strive to reach new heights of fun in their creations.

3074
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:15,540
Aww!

3075
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:19,020
Get the creator to drink me.

3076
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:20,000
One problem solved!

3077
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:24,320
Crush 100 bugs in one playthrough.

3078
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:27,960
Clear the game tent.

3079
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:34,460
Achieve an S rank in your overall score.

3080
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:35,160
Oh!

3081
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:36,800
I feel like...

3082
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:38,280
Liquid King.

3083
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:40,880
I feel like I was close-ish.

3084
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:41,620
I got a B.

3085
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:43,180
I got a B.

3086
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:49,100
But I have 10 out of 21.

3087
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:50,260
It's not bad.

3088
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:50,580
Wait.

3089
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,940
Oh, there's more over here!

3090
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:55,400
Okay.

3091
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:57,300
Find and crush S bugs.

3092
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:00,660
Get to the creator's room.

3093
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:03,280
Try touching Famitsu.

3094
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:04,460
Oh no, I didn't touch it.

3095
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:06,560
Collect 1000 coins.

3096
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:09,100
Stand on all flowcharts.

3097
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:09,620
Oh.

3098
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:14,940
Reach the goal with no damage.

3099
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:17,340
Guess that's it.

3100
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:20,860
Oh wait, there's more here.

3101
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:22,560
Yellow Phoenix.

3102
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:25,000
Overcome 50 game overs.

3103
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:29,840
What do you mean, overcome 50?

3104
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:30,480
What does that mean?

3105
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:34,380
It was an S rank to us.

3106
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:35,100
Thank you.

3107
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:40,180
It's

3108
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:43,460
our win.

3109
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:44,200
1 and under 50.

3110
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:45,040
Yippee!

3111
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:54,320
At least it's...

3112
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:56,500
I'm so curious what my number is though.

3113
02:23:58,800 --> 02:23:59,960
Oh, my eyes!

3114
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:02,720
This is fun, you guys.

3115
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,060
I hope you had fun.

3116
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:08,860
I hope you are inspired to drink calorie moat now.

3117
02:24:11,460 --> 02:24:14,940
I think I will see next time when I'm just enjoying it.

3118
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:26,260
When I'm in Japan next week, I will get a liquid calorie mate and I will report back how it is.

3119
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:27,800
Hopefully I can drink it.

3120
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:30,360
I'll see if it's carbonated first.

3121
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:33,420
If it's carbonated, then I'll let you guys know.

3122
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:35,960
If it's not, then I will...

3123
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:40,240
What's the word?

3124
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:42,680
Not have it.

3125
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:44,300
Obviously.

3126
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,300
Can you play a retro game called Cool Spot someday?

3127
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:50,680
Cool Spot?

3128
02:24:50,860 --> 02:24:52,160
I've never heard of it, but thank you.

3129
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:53,280
I'll look into it.

3130
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:54,600
Thanks for the recommendation.

3131
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:57,380
Thanks for the funny Kusuge stream.

3132
02:24:57,560 --> 02:24:58,040
Thank you!

3133
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:00,380
And of course I will be drinking the fruit flavor.

3134
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:01,820
Spank!

3135
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:02,860
Thanks for the tank gifter!

3136
02:25:03,220 --> 02:25:03,700
Danku!

3137
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:06,920
It doesn't mention carbon dioxide in the content.

3138
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:08,320
Oh.

3139
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:09,760
Maybe it's okay then.

3140
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:12,280
I guess we'll see.

3141
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,200
I want to play... what was it?

3142
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:19,280
There's a Doom mod.

3143
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:21,860
Oh, but it's like for a cereal.

3144
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:22,700
I can't remember.

3145
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,480
I want to play that one.

3146
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:26,300
I think it's a cereal.

3147
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:29,660
Burger King stealth game?

3148
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:30,400
No way.

3149
02:25:30,740 --> 02:25:32,440
Wasn't there like a McDonald's one too?

3150
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:34,400
Chex Quest!

3151
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:35,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3152
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:36,720
Chex Quest.

3153
02:25:38,380 --> 02:25:39,580
I want to play that one.

3154
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:42,660
Maybe we can have a day of just like...

3155
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:44,840
going through strange...

3156
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:46,340
food...

3157
02:25:47,220 --> 02:25:48,840
restaurant crossover games.

3158
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:51,040
You know?

3159
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:53,780
Maybe I'll do that.

3160
02:25:58,580 --> 02:25:59,780
Pepsi... Pepsiman!

3161
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:03,600
Kusuge ad games.

3162
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:04,340
Yeah, exactly.

3163
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:06,800
There was one recently of the...

3164
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:09,600
of the purple guy from McDonald's though, wasn't there?

3165
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:11,660
I can't remember it.

3166
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:17,110
Grimace.

3167
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:18,070
Yeah, the Grimace game.

3168
02:26:19,410 --> 02:26:20,730
Wasn't it a platformer?

3169
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:21,050
Oh, no.

3170
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:22,090
It's the skateboarding.

3171
02:26:23,010 --> 02:26:23,630
I think.

3172
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:25,530
Am I crazy?

3173
02:26:26,630 --> 02:26:27,630
Yeah, it was a Game Boy game.

3174
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:28,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3175
02:26:29,390 --> 02:26:30,190
William Afton?

3176
02:26:33,070 --> 02:26:35,030
The KFC... The KFC dating sim?

3177
02:26:38,510 --> 02:26:39,850
How long is it actually?

3178
02:26:40,050 --> 02:26:40,790
How... Hold on.

3179
02:26:44,030 --> 02:26:47,590
How long to beat KFC game?

3180
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:53,410
One and a half hours.

3181
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:58,690
Thank you for the fun and pro gaming stream!

3182
02:26:59,710 --> 02:27:01,870
Have lots of fun!

3183
02:27:01,890 --> 02:27:02,230
Yippee!

3184
02:27:02,970 --> 02:27:03,650
Yippee!

3185
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:06,930
Thank you!

3186
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:09,810
I'm so excited for the sign!

3187
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:09,930
Sign!

3188
02:27:14,590 --> 02:27:15,610
Try Princess, thank you!

3189
02:27:17,090 --> 02:27:19,030
You should live react to the Calorie Mate speedrun.

3190
02:27:19,130 --> 02:27:20,290
Oh, yeah, let's see it.

3191
02:27:20,330 --> 02:27:20,770
Let's check it out.

3192
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:25,430
Hold on, let me get it up.

3193
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:28,230
Let me get it up.

3194
02:27:28,730 --> 02:27:29,350
One second.

3195
02:27:30,950 --> 02:27:32,210
Here, let me move you guys back.

3196
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:33,910
To the corner with you!

3197
02:27:37,130 --> 02:27:37,450
Um...

3198
02:27:40,930 --> 02:27:44,090
Calorie Mate... Wait, oh, why did I exit?

3199
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:49,170
Okay, Calorie... Calorie Mate speedrun.

3200
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:54,070
Um...

3201
02:27:57,350 --> 02:27:59,370
Oh, wait, I wrote the wrong thing.

3202
02:27:59,510 --> 02:28:00,910
Cal... Cal... Cal...

3203
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:06,630
How do I find it?

3204
02:28:08,730 --> 02:28:09,370
Who...

3205
02:28:10,450 --> 02:28:12,290
Who do you recommend?

3206
02:28:15,030 --> 02:28:16,030
Gotta play Sneak King.

3207
02:28:16,530 --> 02:28:18,130
I know, some other people are bringing it up.

3208
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:19,590
Moira Masu!

3209
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:20,990
Welcome to membership, thank you!

3210
02:28:21,970 --> 02:28:24,470
Who's the creator that did it so quickly?

3211
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:36,880
Do you guys know the name of the speedrunner?

3212
02:28:37,860 --> 02:28:38,360
Oh, wait!

3213
02:28:38,460 --> 02:28:38,900
I found it!

3214
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:40,940
RTA 53 seconds.

3215
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:43,040
Yeah, yeah, I found it.

3216
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:43,700
I found it immediately.

3217
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:45,380
After I asked.

3218
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:45,720
Okay.

3219
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:47,580
Give me one second...

3220
02:28:47,580 --> 02:28:48,760
Let me...

3221
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:50,640
Pull it up...

3222
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:53,980
Window capture...

3223
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:58,440
Window capture...

3224
02:29:09,980 --> 02:29:10,940
It's not perfect.

3225
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:11,540
Good enough.

3226
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:12,260
Maybe.

3227
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:14,680
Good enough, maybe.

3228
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:19,340
Okay, this is from ND606.

3229
02:29:20,460 --> 02:29:22,520
It says their speedrun is 53 seconds.

3230
02:29:24,020 --> 02:29:25,200
Do they talk in it?

3231
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:28,720
Okay, here we go.

3232
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:31,240
This is not me, this is a speedrun.

3233
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:33,700
This is a speedrun.

3234
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,160
Oh, okay.

3235
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:36,320
Alright.

3236
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:41,420
Oh my god!

3237
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:43,100
That's how you can do it!

3238
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:49,160
Oh my god, you can distract him with the bomb!

3239
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:56,980
So he basically... I did the same strats here.

3240
02:29:57,440 --> 02:29:58,320
It's really loud.

3241
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:01,540
I did the same strats here.

3242
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:03,020
Oh.

3243
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:06,540
Wow, he even gets up there before the guy is there.

3244
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:07,720
Oh my god!

3245
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:11,140
Yeah!

3246
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:11,280
Yeah!

3247
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:12,560
Yeah!

3248
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:13,520
Oh.

3249
02:30:14,460 --> 02:30:15,100
What?

3250
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:17,340
What?

3251
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:20,600
Oh my god!

3252
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:22,580
Okay.

3253
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:24,720
I'm so curious about this part the most.

3254
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:25,180
Oh!

3255
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:41,930
They're not even first, they're 43rd!

3256
02:30:43,750 --> 02:30:45,490
Oh my gosh!

3257
02:30:45,630 --> 02:30:46,970
They're not even first!

3258
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:51,490
They're not even first.

3259
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:56,030
You guys have to watch this video.

3260
02:30:56,250 --> 02:30:57,370
Of Cinnamoroll.

3261
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:58,590
Singing...

3262
02:31:03,010 --> 02:31:03,650
43rd.

3263
02:31:06,630 --> 02:31:08,270
That's so messed up.

3264
02:31:08,990 --> 02:31:11,410
Also, this is the best... I found a new...

3265
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:13,510
I found a new Fujisan live cam.

3266
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:14,550
And look at this!

3267
02:31:14,930 --> 02:31:16,230
Look how beautiful!

3268
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:17,690
Hold on, let me show you.

3269
02:31:18,410 --> 02:31:20,070
Let me show you the sunrise.

3270
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:21,550
Look!

3271
02:31:22,830 --> 02:31:24,670
I need to go here.

3272
02:31:25,090 --> 02:31:27,010
I need to go to this place.

3273
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:29,130
Isn't it so beautiful?

3274
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:31,370
I'm so sad though.

3275
02:31:31,430 --> 02:31:35,690
Because my usual Fujisan cam has been blurry for the past like two weeks.

3276
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:37,290
So I've been like...

3277
02:31:37,290 --> 02:31:38,610
But I found this one.

3278
02:31:38,690 --> 02:31:42,450
And I found actually another one that was so, so, so good.

3279
02:31:42,450 --> 02:31:44,210
Oh my gosh, I need to go to here.

3280
02:31:46,170 --> 02:31:47,730
I need to go to this place.

3281
02:31:47,850 --> 02:31:49,050
It looks so beautiful.

3282
02:31:49,770 --> 02:31:50,930
Oh my gosh.

3283
02:31:50,930 --> 02:31:51,890
I've just been like...

3284
02:31:51,890 --> 02:31:52,470
There was...

3285
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:52,950
And then...

3286
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:54,610
The other day...

3287
02:31:54,610 --> 02:31:56,610
The other day, there was Fujisan here, right?

3288
02:31:56,690 --> 02:31:58,630
And then over here was like a storm.

3289
02:31:59,230 --> 02:32:00,350
There's a storm incoming.

3290
02:32:00,830 --> 02:32:01,670
And then...

3291
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:02,430
And then...

3292
02:32:02,430 --> 02:32:04,950
So you could see like all the thunder and lightning and stuff.

3293
02:32:04,970 --> 02:32:05,450
It was crazy.

3294
02:32:05,710 --> 02:32:07,330
I should have taken a video of it.

3295
02:32:07,570 --> 02:32:09,090
Oh man, that was so awesome.

3296
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:11,550
Kuwabara, Kuwabara.

3297
02:32:12,450 --> 02:32:14,330
Sounds good for a living retirement place.

3298
02:32:14,490 --> 02:32:14,850
No!

3299
02:32:15,570 --> 02:32:16,130
Because...

3300
02:32:16,710 --> 02:32:18,330
On this mountain...

3301
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:20,110
You can't...

3302
02:32:20,110 --> 02:32:21,390
Are they moving?

3303
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:22,610
Why are these...

3304
02:32:22,610 --> 02:32:22,990
Oh, yeah.

3305
02:32:23,110 --> 02:32:24,390
They're just really still.

3306
02:32:25,410 --> 02:32:28,710
On this mountain, you can't use soap.

3307
02:32:29,150 --> 02:32:30,550
Or shampoo.

3308
02:32:31,210 --> 02:32:34,130
Fly over to wipe the lens of the blurry one.

3309
02:32:34,210 --> 02:32:35,550
I know, I really should.

3310
02:32:36,210 --> 02:32:39,370
You can't use soap to preserve the waters in the mountain.

3311
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:42,430
You can't use soap to preserve the waters in the mountain.

3312
02:32:42,430 --> 02:32:43,090
You can't use soap.

3313
02:32:43,930 --> 02:32:44,790
Isn't that crazy?

3314
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:48,790
If I went, you guys would actually be able to call me stinky.

3315
02:32:49,230 --> 02:32:50,470
You'd be like, oh my gosh.

3316
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:51,950
Mints on the mountain.

3317
02:32:52,290 --> 02:32:54,210
She can't wash herself properly.

3318
02:32:54,410 --> 02:32:55,370
Stinky, stinky, stinky.

3319
02:32:56,930 --> 02:33:00,070
Imagine what all the people that live on the shrine smell like.

3320
02:33:02,330 --> 02:33:04,370
Do you get used to the stench?

3321
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:07,110
Or is it just because it's so breezy all the time?

3322
02:33:07,150 --> 02:33:08,350
You never smell anybody.

3323
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:09,910
I wonder.

3324
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:11,110
But look at this.

3325
02:33:12,110 --> 02:33:12,930
Isn't it just gorgeous?

3326
02:33:12,930 --> 02:33:14,390
I can't wait to see what it looks like in winter.

3327
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:17,610
Because then you'll get like the little ice cap on top.

3328
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:19,750
I'm so excited to see.

3329
02:33:19,850 --> 02:33:23,410
And then I wonder if the other mountains will be a little bit snowy too.

3330
02:33:24,630 --> 02:33:26,330
But I wonder if you can go in winter.

3331
02:33:27,530 --> 02:33:29,810
If the snow will be too harsh.

3332
02:33:30,510 --> 02:33:31,070
I don't know.

3333
02:33:31,150 --> 02:33:33,010
Well, I mean for myself, you know.

3334
02:33:36,010 --> 02:33:37,730
Mint, why would I imagine the smell?

3335
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:39,130
Because I'm curious.

3336
02:33:41,450 --> 02:33:41,970
Hold on.

3337
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:44,810
Let me see if I can find the other Fujisan camera that I found.

3338
02:33:45,070 --> 02:33:45,650
Here, I'll show you.

3339
02:33:45,690 --> 02:33:46,130
I'll show you.

3340
02:33:46,150 --> 02:33:46,610
I'll show you.

3341
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:47,550
I'll show you.

3342
02:33:47,570 --> 02:33:48,050
I'll show you.

3343
02:33:48,290 --> 02:33:48,650
Okay.

3344
02:33:48,730 --> 02:33:49,990
This is the one I usually use.

3345
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:52,390
Look at this.

3346
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:53,090
It's so sad.

3347
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:58,790
It looks like I have my glasses off.

3348
02:33:59,150 --> 02:33:59,850
It sucks.

3349
02:34:00,830 --> 02:34:01,770
It's so sad.

3350
02:34:04,890 --> 02:34:06,250
It's so bad.

3351
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:08,770
I know.

3352
02:34:10,150 --> 02:34:10,550
Yeah.

3353
02:34:10,690 --> 02:34:13,570
So, this is the one I've used for like years even.

3354
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:16,470
But then I found this one today or the other day.

3355
02:34:16,810 --> 02:34:18,950
And so, look how beautiful.

3356
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:20,870
Look at the colors and everything.

3357
02:34:22,390 --> 02:34:24,570
So, I'll use this one from now on.

3358
02:34:28,010 --> 02:34:28,410
Yeah.

3359
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:30,650
It's so pretty.

3360
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:32,730
So, so pretty.

3361
02:34:32,970 --> 02:34:33,750
It looks like a painting.

3362
02:34:33,830 --> 02:34:34,270
I know.

3363
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:37,470
So pretty.

3364
02:34:37,470 --> 02:34:38,130
So pretty.

3365
02:34:40,110 --> 02:34:40,750
Yeah.

3366
02:34:41,450 --> 02:34:42,410
What's this?

3367
02:34:42,410 --> 02:34:43,370
Haneda live cam.

3368
02:34:51,170 --> 02:34:53,190
They stream from 9 AM.

3369
02:34:54,390 --> 02:34:55,670
Fujisama Kamiyoshi.

3370
02:34:55,870 --> 02:34:56,190
I know.

3371
02:35:02,310 --> 02:35:04,090
Is this right now?

3372
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:04,810
It says it's live.

3373
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:06,850
920.

3374
02:35:08,430 --> 02:35:09,330
That's today.

3375
02:35:09,470 --> 02:35:10,470
Well, it's in Japan.

3376
02:35:11,550 --> 02:35:12,630
That's right now.

3377
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:16,350
Wow.

3378
02:35:18,450 --> 02:35:19,290
Oh, no.

3379
02:35:20,010 --> 02:35:21,590
Why did I find this?

3380
02:35:23,470 --> 02:35:24,470
Oh, no.

3381
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:26,370
Oh, no.

3382
02:35:26,370 --> 02:35:28,090
I'm going to be watching this all the time now.

3383
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:28,910
Oh, no.

3384
02:35:30,810 --> 02:35:31,370
Like.

3385
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:36,830
They're like so cute.

3386
02:35:36,830 --> 02:35:37,550
Speaking of my ear.

3387
02:35:39,270 --> 02:35:41,170
Time to stream yourself landing at the airport.

3388
02:35:41,370 --> 02:35:41,870
Okay, you guys.

3389
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:43,670
I'm going to give you my exact time.

3390
02:35:43,890 --> 02:35:44,330
No, I'm just kidding.

3391
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:47,810
I'm going to tell you exactly when I fly.

3392
02:35:47,870 --> 02:35:48,590
Is there a Narita one?

3393
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:51,210
I'm going to tell you exactly when I fly in.

3394
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:54,550
And I'll say, okay, look out for me.

3395
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:04,000
Yeah.

3396
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:05,140
Look at them.

3397
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:05,280
Oh.

3398
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:09,660
Are they?

3399
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:11,460
Did they just land?

3400
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:13,280
Wait.

3401
02:36:13,380 --> 02:36:13,780
Oh, my gosh.

3402
02:36:13,780 --> 02:36:15,900
This person is like work in the camera.

3403
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:16,640
Nope.

3404
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:17,680
No, they're taking off.

3405
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:18,640
Oh, my gosh.

3406
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:19,480
This is so awesome.

3407
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:23,180
They go.

3408
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:30,650
Oh, my gosh.

3409
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:35,480
The wings.

3410
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:36,780
Wow.

3411
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:37,920
Bye.

3412
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:38,260
Bye.

3413
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:38,960
Oh, my gosh.

3414
02:36:39,020 --> 02:36:39,640
There goes the.

3415
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:41,600
There goes the tires.

3416
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:43,760
This cat.

3417
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:44,560
Is this their job?

3418
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:48,700
To just run the camera.

3419
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:52,160
I want this.

3420
02:36:52,180 --> 02:36:52,740
Look at this job.

3421
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:57,760
Is that Skytree over there?

3422
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:01,320
So foggy.

3423
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:03,760
So smoggy.

3424
02:37:05,880 --> 02:37:07,540
Yeah, they are doing a great job.

3425
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:08,980
I just turned back.

3426
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:10,400
Why are we watching the Tokyo airport?

3427
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:12,060
Cuz I wanna.

3428
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:16,800
I just checked the flight tracker.

3429
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:17,380
It's live.

3430
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:19,740
That's so awesome!

3431
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:25,980
Wow, I guess these... I wonder if they are domestic flights.

3432
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,240
It's all A&A.

3433
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:29,180
That one was JAL, but...

3434
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:34,580
Yeah, you do your job, mister.

3435
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:39,040
It's just controlling the camera.

3436
02:37:44,700 --> 02:37:45,300
Alrighty.

3437
02:37:45,300 --> 02:37:48,500
I don't wanna get copyright struck by Haneda airport.

3438
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:55,680
I'm having flashbacks to... I'm having flashbacks to Spy Animals.

3439
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:00,080
Which if you know, you know.

3440
02:38:02,260 --> 02:38:03,180
The BBC.

3441
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:07,860
You guys, I have a permanent copyright strike on my account because of the BBC.

3442
02:38:08,250 --> 02:38:11,000
Because I showed Spy Animals and they didn't like that.

3443
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:12,700
And then I got copyright struck.

3444
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:15,820
It was... No, not the plastic crabs.

3445
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:16,680
It was the monkey.

3446
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,260
It was the monkey.

3447
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:18,620
It was the monkey.

3448
02:38:20,820 --> 02:38:23,640
I work for a cargo facility that works directly with JAL.

3449
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,860
You could be on here one day.

3450
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:27,160
Maybe.

3451
02:38:29,560 --> 02:38:31,300
They didn't want the truth getting out.

3452
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:35,280
Don't Google Spy Animals.

3453
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:41,280
I was letting out... I was letting spy government secrets to my stream.

3454
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:43,520
I had like... Oh my gosh.

3455
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:45,520
It also annoys me.

3456
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,640
I had like... I don't know.

3457
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:48,600
Like less than a hundred viewers.

3458
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:53,520
And they still targeted me so hard.

3459
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:57,140
They're like... They're like the world will find out.

3460
02:38:57,260 --> 02:38:58,220
The world will know.

3461
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:03,160
Oh man.

3462
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:04,620
Yeah, messed up.

3463
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:05,640
So messed up.

3464
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:06,780
That's okay.

3465
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:10,280
I can track your flights.

3466
02:39:10,660 --> 02:39:10,980
No!

3467
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:13,100
Don't track my flights!

3468
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:21,100
You know what you did to those monkeys.

3469
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:23,200
Yeah, the Patriots.

3470
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:27,240
I just wanted to watch Spy Animals.

3471
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:28,180
I was so excited.

3472
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:30,380
Okay, I'm done for real now.

3473
02:39:30,820 --> 02:39:32,380
Thank you guys for hanging out with me.

3474
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:35,060
Thanks for allowing me to do a little Fuji update.

3475
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:36,120
Here, we'll go back to it.

3476
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:36,620
Hold on.

3477
02:39:40,290 --> 02:39:41,130
Wait, where's the other one?

3478
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:41,570
Oh, this one.

3479
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:42,530
Oh, no, not that one.

3480
02:39:43,270 --> 02:39:43,950
This one.

3481
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:48,430
Thanks for allowing me to Fuji update you guys.

3482
02:39:48,430 --> 02:39:53,830
And I discovered another live cam and that's dangerous.

3483
02:40:00,210 --> 02:40:06,090
Thank you so much for hanging out with me and letting me play silly calorie mate game.

3484
02:40:06,990 --> 02:40:09,350
I totally gamed it for sure.

3485
02:40:10,270 --> 02:40:12,230
I'm going to try the speedrun strat.

3486
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:15,590
I actually am so curious if I could pull it off.

3487
02:40:15,710 --> 02:40:17,890
Like though at the very end like that.

3488
02:40:17,890 --> 02:40:19,710
It was so goofy and silly and fun.

3489
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:21,310
And yeah.

3490
02:40:21,910 --> 02:40:22,430
Otsuminto.

3491
02:40:22,690 --> 02:40:25,530
And I will see you guys later.

3492
02:40:27,490 --> 02:40:28,010
Itterashai.

3493
02:40:28,550 --> 02:40:29,430
Bye-bye.

3494
02:40:29,430 --> 02:40:30,590
Haruka, welcome back.

3495
02:40:30,710 --> 02:40:31,310
Thank you.

3496
02:40:31,910 --> 02:40:32,810
Bye-bye.

3497
02:40:32,810 --> 02:40:33,390
Bye-bye.

3498
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:33,950
Bye-bye.

3499
02:40:33,950 --> 02:40:34,750
Bye-bye.

3500
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:35,170
Bye-bye.

3501
02:40:35,190 --> 02:40:35,510
Bye-bye.

3502
02:40:35,590 --> 02:40:35,910
Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.
