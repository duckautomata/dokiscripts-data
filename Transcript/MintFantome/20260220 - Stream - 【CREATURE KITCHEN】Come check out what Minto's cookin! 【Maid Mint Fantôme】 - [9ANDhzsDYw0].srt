raiding into Nimi's concert tonight.

66
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,580
So I am a guest in it.

67
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,340
So I'm very, very excited.

68
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,240
I mean, don't go to Japan in a few weeks.

69
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,780
I was wondering if I could get some English-friendly main
Cafe Rex.

70
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,640
A lot of them are pretty English-friendly.

71
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,280
And Akihabara especially.

72
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,320
I would say most have...

73
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,240
Watch Nimi then.

74
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,680
Sushi with the boys.

75
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,500
Let's go.

76
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,280
I would say...

77
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:16,980
like made dreaming at home um uh are there english
unfriendly well it's it's not that they're unfriendly um

78
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:26,060
there are some maid cafes that they do have english menus
but some not entirely of their menus are in english and then

79
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:33,100
some some maid cafes have like better english speakers than
others that's why i bring up like at home or Made Dreamin.

80
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,160
They're very, very used to foreigners.

81
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,320
So, if you're like, I know Zero Nihongo, I would say made
Dreamin or at home.

82
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,140
I still vividly recall you singing Dreamin Passport at
Phantom.

83
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,740
Arigato, Arigato, too.

84
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,200
Yeah, I did sing Dreamin Passport.

85
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,220
Mr. Mayhem, thank you!

86
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
But later jazz showed on.

87
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,700
Thank you for such a beautiful evening.

88
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,860
Not gonna lie, I got a little misty at times.

89
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,960
Getting to see you up on stage and living your dream.

90
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,160
Hope to see you there a lot more in the future.

91
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,460
Thank you.

92
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,940
Thank you.

93
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,100
Does Ike and Bukuro have any maid cafes?

94
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,580
They do.

95
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,860
Yeah, they do.

96
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,260
They do.

97
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,580
I'll be honest though.

98
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,440
I don't think I've been to any in Ike and Bukuro.

99
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,920
Now that I think about it, I convinced another Aibu to go to
deer stage.

100
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,300
I-I-I-I-Iry!

101
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,680
I love Iry!

102
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,420
She's so cute!

103
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,780
I love Iry.

104
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,900
Oh my gosh.

105
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,060
Have fun!

106
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,400
I want to go to deer stage.

107
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,260
Ikebukuro has swallow tail.

108
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,940
I'm pretty sure that's an Ikebukuro.

109
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,200
The Butler Cafe.

110
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,900
Isekai-made cafe was fun when I went last fall.

111
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,660
I love the Isekai-made cafe.

112
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,060
Yeah, there's so many fun-made cafes.

113
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,240
I love all the different themed ones, too.

114
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,560
They're so fun.

115
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,640
Yes, yes.

116
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,820
Creature kitchen.

117
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,580
The creatures are in my kitchen.

118
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,360
I am the creature in the kitchen.

119
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,180
We're creature-ing it up in the kitchen.

120
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,320
Creature feature in the kitchen.

121
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,880
Kitchen creature.

122
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,580
Who is the kitchen and who is the creature?

123
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,820

124
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:38,960
Wait.

125
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,000
Who is the creature in the kitchen?

126
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Featuring the creature.

127
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,440
And the Pinar Snipper guy.

128
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,480
I'm excited to play this!

129
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,240
Oh my gosh.

130
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,140
So I found this game through another streamer that I
watched.

was watching right before stream and I was like I don't want

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,030
We got salt.

183
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,470
Wait, is it pre-cooked pasta?

184
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,050
Or post-cooked?

185
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,210
Is it cooked pasta?

186
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,330
We got a spray bottle.

187
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,010
We got a maple syrup.

188
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:44,130
Sponge, soap, all these lovely ingredients that we can make
a pizza pie.

189
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,130
Oh, that one's locked.

190
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,010
Peanut butter.

191
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,390
Wait.

192
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,190
Oh, bread.

193
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,950

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,250

195
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,010

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,830
My departure must be very concerning.

Food.

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,610

I don't think we can go on these.

208
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,380
The moon room.

209
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,560
The tear room.

210
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,660
The heart room.

211
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,620
I'm gonna, maybe we will keep this light on.

212
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,040
After all.

213
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,720
What recipes do we have?

214
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,260
Toast!

215
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,420
Pancake!

216
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,080
Eggie sandal.

217
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,880
Maybe we enjoy sandal.

218
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,420
Spaghetti and meatballs.

219
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,760
French fries.

220
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,560
Mistake!

221
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,260
Okay.

222
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,780
Oh, bad combo.

223
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,000
Mistake.

224
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,420
That was number 43 though.

225
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,280
Okay, we got a lot.

226
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,700
Let's see.

227
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Cooking basics.

228
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,800
The oven.

229
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,740
In out of the oven.

230
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,160
Of the oven.

231
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,780
In out in...

232
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,780
If oven... Wait, if you...

233
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:10,970
If...

234
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:31,880
every meal is play no made oh my gosh i can't read today
every meal is made by placing ingredients in the oven close

235
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:41,400
the door to inform the unit your offerings are ready be
patient and linger not long near the void of creation safe

236
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:48,260
cutting if you need to slice an ingredient a knife is your
best bet for the safety of your countertop always use a

237
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,480
cutting board If rage overtakes you, put the knife down.

238
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,380
Solid advice.

239
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,240
Offerings, yeah, to me.

240
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,340
Blend ingredients once placed in a bowl.

241
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,480
Make sure you mix in a consistent direction.

242
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,920
Should you need to empty the bowl, use the spring-loaded
plate beneath to eject its contents.

243
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,340
Fast-frying.

244
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,580
Fry up your ingredients to bring out their savory flavors.

245
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,960
in the pan flip and cook to the other side in kitchen
emergencies the pan can be used for self-defense i hope i'm

246
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,080

247
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:44,460

248
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,840

251
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:29,880

of a creature to learn what meals they want Ah, feed each

252
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,180
creature a handful of different meals to become friends.

253
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,460
When you earn three hearts, you'll be gifted a key.

254
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,520
She loves the music of the winds.

255
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,600
Always chittering beneath the porch.

256
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,160
Seems to think he owns the place.

257
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,620
I don't know how people consider these little guys' pests.

258
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,220
They always clean the floor for me.

259
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,820
Oh my gosh, it's like having a dog.

260
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,440
He'll never turn down a dimly lit picnic by the fog.

261
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,620
Sorry, river.

262
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,940
If you're quick enough, you might catch a glimpse of this
little demon.

263
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,940
Wait, there's a demon in our pantry?

264
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,160
Sure likes making messes in the pantry.

265
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,640
Oh, maybe these are in the bedrooms.

266
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Oh, this thing has been here for a long time.

267
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,120
Is it still a dog house when there's not a dog around?

268
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,080
Okay, let's start at the very beginning with this guy.

269
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,380
Do you think I'm going to get copyright for this?

270
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,440
Thank you.

271
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,740
There's a demon.

272
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,560
Wait, oh, there's a camera.

273
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,400
Nice.

274
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,340
Right click to take a photo.

275
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,530
Oh, he's so cute.

276
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,290
The pseudo-nervina.

277
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,110
Let's go.

278
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,330
Did she just say nerd?

279
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,670
And so now I look in here.

280
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,710
Once any two meals.

281
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,470
How do I put this down?

282
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,430
Oh, my bad.

283
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,970
Put it on the table.

284
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,090
Oh, okay, easy.

285
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,170
Ew, what is this?

286
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,010
Slop?

287
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,730
Oh no, it's cooking slopkin.

288
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,930
Alright, let's see what recipe.

289
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,250
Let's toast.

290
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,230
Bread slice.

291
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,470
I had bread...

292
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,830
In here.

293
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,630
So we gotta slice some bread.

294
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,550
Oh, golly.

295
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,910
I'm feeling it, guys.

296
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,390
The rage.

297
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,630
I'm feeling it overcome me.

298
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,550
Bread slice.

299
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,530
So...

300
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,530
I guess I just toasted in the oven?

301
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,210
Is that what it means?

302
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,530
Oh, heavens.

303
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,010
This is easy to burn.

304
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,490
Luckily, my oven knows how to create just about anything.

305
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,510
Okay.

306
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:04,910
Oh.

307
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,450
Oh,

308
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,370
and it said stand away.

309
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,030
Definitely not cooking, ma'am.

310
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,990
Oh!

311
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,470
Wow!

312
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,030
My one slice became two!

313
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,010
And with the butter!

314
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,770
How handy!

315
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,450
Toast for you!

316
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:34,730
Oh!

317
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,040
How'd the butter get on?

318
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,160
Don't question my magic.

319
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,620
So cute!

320
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,100
Cook a reunion dinner for us?

321
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,860
Toast.

322
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,420
Buttered toast.

323
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,620
Look at the moon.

324
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Oh.

325
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,500
Oh wow, there's so much stuff out here.

326
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Okay.

327
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,220
What the?

328
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,720
I need to get my camera.

329
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,460
Trash cat!

330
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,580
Oh, that's a terrible thing.

331
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,380
photo though.

332
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,620
We gotta get a better one of that guy.

333
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,800
Wait, I can't toss it.

334
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,900
Okay, hold on.

335
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,020
Little guy!

336
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,460
Where'd he go?

337
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,940
Trash cat!

338
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,020
You were in the bushes.

339
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,420
Woo!

340
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:32,900
Hello!

341
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,100
Oh, that's a mushroom.

342
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,440
Oh, oops.

343
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,620
Oh, mushroom discovered.

344
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,100
All right, hold on.

345
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,660
I'm looking for my cat.

346
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,660
Come back, stuffy!

347
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,660
Yeah.

348
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,490
The music...

349
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,750
Wait, that's a cute one.

350
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,590
It's kind of creepy.

351
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,270
TJ, thank you so much for the captain!

352
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,850
We'll keep that one.

353
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,030
Where does he keep going?

354
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,190
Is there a hole in here?

355
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,890
I can't walk into the bush.

356
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,270
Alright.

357
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,930
Um, I need two meals.

358
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,130
That's this guy, the one that is chittering under the porch.

359
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,570
He wants two sandwiches.

360
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:26,970
Alright.

361
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,710
Well, I...

362
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,010
Okay, so we made the toast.

363
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,150
What else can we make?

364
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,370
Sandwiches.

365
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,250
We can make pancakes with dough.

366
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,670
Okay, I saw the maple syrup.

367
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,610
Do I put it in the...

368
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,610
We're just gonna put everything in the oven.

369
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,410
Dough.

370
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,070
Mix flour and water.

371
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,470
I remember the flour was...

372
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,410
Yeah, here.

373
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,510
And then this is our mixing bowl, right?

374
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,050
Okay.

375
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,210
Reese, thank you!

376
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,010
Water?

377
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,890
Did we see water?

378
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,830
Spray bottle?

379
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,880
Salt.

380
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,720
Pasta.

381
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,160
This was peanut butter.

382
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,420
Maybe in our pantry?

383
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,900
I'm afraid of the demon.

384
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,660
Oh!

385
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,390
Oh, the salt.

386
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,090
Sink!

387
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,650
But what would I collect it in?

388
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,690
My hands?

389
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,410
How would I collect this?

390
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,910
Oh, hold left click to activate.

391
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,280
Yes, yes.

392
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,720
Yes, yes.

393
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,100
Namie, thank you so much for the...

394
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,540
Great!

395
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,110
I'm making pancakes in my oven.

396
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,990
I think this is how it works.

397
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,590
Maple syrup and dough.

398
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,510
Welcome in!

399
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:07,950
Welcome!

400
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,150
Oh, it says done.

401
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,390
Please don't be a mistake.

402
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,050
That looks good!

403
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,470
I can't steal two thank you!

404
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,010
Where's the butter coming from?

405
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,410
I'm nervous.

406
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,410
Where's the butter coming from?

407
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,530
Yummy.

408
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,490
I know, I wish it were like this too.

409
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,790
Those look good.

410
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,810
Become friends with a creature.

411
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,790
Oh, he loves me.

412
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,970
Can I pet you?

413
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:39,710
No.

414
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,910
I got a fish key.

415
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,690
Which opens.

416
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,550
The refruit- I should close the pantry, huh?

417
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,570
Nah, well, thank you so much for the 10 get there!

418
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,210
Oh, this is where the butter is coming from!

419
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,730
And so much lettuce!

420
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,780
Who's missing?

421
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,560
One strawberry!

422
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,110
Is there like a...

423
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,290
Let's just close this.

424
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,770
It says we have to be fast, right?

425
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,670
To get the demon?

426
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,070
Has a knack for finding things.

427
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,950
Seems to like music.

428
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,510
Might be a bit of a thief.

429
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,890
Let us cook.

430
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,170
Alright, we got it.

431
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,750
We got trash cat here.

432
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,730
Who wants two sandwiches?

433
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,790
I think we had an eggy sandal.

434
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:33,850
Yeah.

435
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,110
And PB&J?

436
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,770
It's the thumbnail!

437
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,730
Let's do that one.

438
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,650
Bread slice two.

439
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,310
Peanut butter and jam.

440
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:40,830
We got to mix.

441
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,890
Oh, this is perfect.

442
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,950
We got to mix.

443
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,670
Okay.

444
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,210
Two bread slices.

445
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,710
Peanut butter.

446
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,940
Do I lose these once I use them?

447
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,500
They don't respawn, it seems.

448
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,820
Strawberry.

449
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,940
Did we see sugar?

450
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,280
Broth?

451
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,520
Tomato.

452
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,340
Sugar!

453
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,040
Okay.

454
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Mix.

455
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:14,940
Plus.

456
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,060
Strawberry.

457
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,400
Wow.

458
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,900
We're making the jam for this guy.

459
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,340
What is it?

460
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,960
Oh, egg.

461
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,540
Why is it different?

462
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:27,720
Oh!

463
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,540
Oh, it changes.

464
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,960
Again.

465
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,220
It looks like my mozzarella and tomato right now.

466
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,760
Sugar bottom, right?

467
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,040
Here, here, here, here.

468
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,720
We packaged it all up.

469
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,040
This is a reminder you're amazing.

470
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,960
Very entertaining.

471
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,000
I am?

472
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,300
Thank you, Wiggle.

473
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,080
Thank you.

474
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,060
I guess that is really a jam, right?

475
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,800
It's just sugar.

476
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,900
And the...

477
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,260
The...

478
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,880
What's it called?

479
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,960
Um...

480
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,540
The fruit?

481
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,220
Sugar and berry?

482
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,060
Alright, PB&J Sandy.

483
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,600
Coming up!

484
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,680
Little God!

485
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,040
The...

486
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,880
The storm is so loud for how clear the night is.

487
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,500
Little guy!

488
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,400
Little guy!

489
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,440
Little guy!

490
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,880
Where?

491
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,460
Uh oh!

492
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,340
Little guy!

493
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,520
Yeah, you're under the porch!

494
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,220
Little guy!

495
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Little guy!

496
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
What's going on here?

497
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,000
Coffee!

498
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:03,740
We're gonna get a cat and a bat and Minecraft Steve!

499
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,220
There he is!

500
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,820
You want this PPHI?

501
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,480
What

502
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,000
were you...

503
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,160
Oh, you were trying the mushroom.

504
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,420
Oh, oh, we have a little grave here.

505
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:27,920
Interesting.

506
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,180
Fascinating.

507
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,900
I scared him away.

508
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,920
What?

509
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,920
Where is he?

510
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,460
I heard him.

511
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,360
I heard him chittering.

512
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,640
Hey!

513
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,020
Maybe I have to...

514
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,040
There's no plate for him, so maybe I like throw it at him.

515
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Is there stuff over here?

516
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,240
I'm exploring a little bit.

517
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,500
Oh!

518
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm exploring now.

519
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,140
Oh, okay.

520
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,260
That's how we throw it.

521
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,080
What's this?

522
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,100
Oh.

523
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,110
Oh, it's...

524
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,570
Ah!

525
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,770
I got a carrot.

526
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,330
And...

527
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:13,930
Omelette.

528
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,990
With a carrot?

529
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,510
I guess you could.

530
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,030
I wish my oven had the vacuum of deep space.

531
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,370
Yeah, but your pantry would have a demon in it, so...

532
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,870
You pick your battles, I suppose.

533
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:27,830
Hello!

534
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,890
Little critter, creature.

535
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:34,830
Oh!

536
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,930
He's a fan!

537
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,410
The moon shower is beautiful tonight.

538
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,370
Isn't it?

539
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:50,750
Snuffy!

540
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,310
Snuffy!

541
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:51,650
Come here!

542
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,490
Come here, Snuffy!

543
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,610
Come here.

544
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,290
Let me crawl into your hole.

545
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,790
I feed you and this is how you repay me.

546
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,630
Z to magnify.

547
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,270
Whoa.

548
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,130
Our clock.

549
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,490
It's...

550
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,670
I'm guessing that's 3.30 a...

551
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,010
Wait!

552
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,510
I think this is a real time.

553
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,510
It's 3.30 p.m.

554
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,030
for me.

555
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,430

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,440
eggy sand here bread slice to fry fried egg.

560
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,040
Oh, we haven't been able to fry anything yet.

561
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,560
Good thing I've...

562
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,040
Oh, wow, look, it really is...

563
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,240
Can I put myself on?

564
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,200
Oh, no, no, no!

565
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,180
Oh, well, we're making toast.

566
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,500
Have a good stream!

567
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,540
Thank you!

568
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,800
Choo!

569
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:16,840
Choo!

570
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,300
Hello, Mito and I booze IQ!

571
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,920
Coming to you from Streamlabs because YouTube doesn't want
me to donate for some reason today.

572
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,640
Oh, no!

573
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,920
That's okay.

574
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,620
Save your mind.

575
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,420
Come on, save your money!

576
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,820
Sorry, I'm being late.

577
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,780
No, you're not late!

578
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,100
Long day at the paint spilling factory.

579
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,340
I hope you are doing all today and I hope the creatures are
chilled.

580
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,120
We're having dust!

581
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,140
Can I eat it?

582
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,680
Alright.

583
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,440
Dang, I wasted a bread slice.

584
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,300
Well, it was one of the ends.

585
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,280
It was one of the ends.

586
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,580
So hopefully, you know, the pieces that nobody likes.

587
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,920
Alright, so we're frying an egg now.

588
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,620
Oh.

589
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:56,860
Whoa.

590
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,380
Ooh.

591
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,720
Whoa.

592
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,420
Oh yeah.

593
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:01,720
Wait.

594
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,380
Uh, flip.

595
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,580
I'm assuming this is the other side.

596
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,620
They look the same.

597
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,300
Oh, this is, oh my gosh, this is the most well buttered,
oiled pan ever.

598
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,380
Maybe not.

599
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,400
Maybe I need to flip it.

600
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:18,760
Flip.

601
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,480
Flip.

602
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,880
They all look the same.

603
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,900
Oh, we did it.

604
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,400
Oh, I left my fridge open.

605
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,260
I'm the worst.

606
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,540
Arctic eggs.

607
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,120
I've wanted to try playing that game before.

608
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,720
Eggie...

609
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,340
With the tomato!

610
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,020
Hot dog.

611
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,940
Sandwich.

612
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,220
Little friend.

613
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,720
I know you're out and about.

614
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,520
There you go.

615
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,600
He loves it.

616
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,840
I'm lost in that oven.

617
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,200
Wait, the way he runs is so cute.

618
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,830
Oh, thank you.

619
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,370
Are we friends now?

620
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,110
Hands in the air.

621
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,950
We got a key, a square key.

622
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,490
Wait, oh here!

623
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,470
Cheese!

624
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,090
Cheese to meet you.

625
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,190
Oh, cheese?

626
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,750
And a pizza!

627
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,030
A new friend, a new friend!

628
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,110
Con!

629
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,910
Ooh, mid-action shot.

630
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,670
A plus.

631
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,570
Wait, are you eating the...

632
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,550
Guys, there's somebody outside.

633
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,150
He ate the slop.

634
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:58,510
Oh!

635
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,920
He's in the chair now.

636
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,440
Are we friends now?

637
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,440
Oh, that was so sweet!

638
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,800
Wait, I missed this under here.

639
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,480
What is this?

640
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:22,980
Okay.

641
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,280
There's much to this game now, isn't there?

642
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,340
We got a little mouse.

643
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,420
Want three snacks with cheese.

644
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,960
I don't know.

645
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

646
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,140
Them.

647
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,960
Them.

648
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,940
How mysterious.

649
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,640
Cheese and crackers we have.

650
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,040
Does omelette have cheese?

651
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,340
Technically.

652
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,840
Is omelette a snack?

653
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,460
Does spaghetti and meatballs have cheese?

654
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,100
No.

655
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,500
It's not good spaghetti and meatballs.

656
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,140
Cheese and crackers.

657
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,340
We got two cheese.

658
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,400
Cheese and crackers.

659
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,180
Pizza.

660
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,060
Does pizza count as a snack?

661
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,080
This one's quite intensive.

662
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,300
We gotta mix a bunch of stuff.

663
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,920
Let's start with our omelet.

664
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,780
We have to slice a bunch of stuff.

665
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,500
Oh, wow.

666
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,960
We're slicing cheese.

667
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,960
Oh.

668
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,700
Slice.

669
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,520
Slice.

670
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,920
Feeling a rage.

671
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,770
Overcoming me.

672
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,320
We're slicing a mushroom and a tomato.

673
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,060
That's a strawberry.

674
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,260
Tomatoes were in here.

675
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,340
Blade mode.

676
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:03,940
Mushroom.

677
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,020
Wait, what am I making?

678
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,920
Oh, an omelet.

679
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,360
Ew, with a mushroom?

680
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,200
Ew.

681
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:14,780
Ew.

682
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,860
And watch this, watch this.

683
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,160
Oh, yeah!

684
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,100
I might be the most skilled at it all.

685
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,380
Wait, why are we frying the egg to make the omelet?

686
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,440
I think I gotta go get a mushroom.

687
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,200
We'll let him be.

688
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,880
Here's one.

689
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,940
Who is here, Grandma?

690
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,500
Just one slice.

691
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,200
Whoa!

692
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,020
Boy, this thing is huge!

693
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,400
I can't even see the eggy anymore!

694
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,760
It's overcome with mushroom!

695
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,410
Yeah, we don't question the oven.

696
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,570
The oven...

697
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,370
The oven...

698
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,950
That looks incredible!

699
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,450
What the heck?

700
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,150
There you go.

701
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,570
Oh.

702
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

703
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,670
It sounded almost like he was going to go

704
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,230
Today's my birthday!

705
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,010
Happy birthday!

706
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,110
Happy birthday!

707
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,330
Happy birthday!

708
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,410
Alright, what else?

709
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,550
That was an omelet.

710
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,850
How many did he want?

711
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,250
Three?

712
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:40,830
I think?

713
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,770
Three snacks with cheese.

714
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,550
Oh, yeah.

715
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,870
Oh, oh, yeah, okay.

716
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,810
May your scars stay blue.

717
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,710
Pizza.

718
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,370
Flower and water.

719
00:39:59,330 --> 00:39:59,870
How am I supposed to...

720
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,590
You guys say I should get it from the sink, but I don't know
how.

721
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,170
Flower?

722
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,770
I think I get it from in here.

723
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,050
Okay.

724
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,020
Oh, oh, thank goodness.

725
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,740
I'm too scared of the demon.

726
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,260
I'm too scared of the demon, I think.

727
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,070
Nice.

728
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,750
But you're a ghost.

729
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,210
But I'm not a demon.

730
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,670
All right, tomato and salt.

731
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,430
When I run out, will I be able to get more?

732
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,220
Sure he's chill.

733
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,940
Alright, we'll brave it.

734
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,540
We'll brave it right after this.

735
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,780
We'll be brave.

736
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,220
And we'll go into the pantry.

737
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,500
It looks humongous.

738
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,060
We jarred it even?

739
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,680
And a cheese slice.

740
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,720
Good thing I have all my food right here.

741
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,520
Cross-contamination be damned.

742
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,660
Don't be afraid.

743
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,540
We don't bite much.

744
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,820
I don't know.

745
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,500
After the omelette, I really expected like Michelin Star.

746
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,180
That one kind of looked a little.

747
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,360
It's pizza.

748
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,640
It's the best pizza in all of London.

749
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,360
You like that?

750
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:43,920
Oh yeah.

751
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,020
Get in your hall.

752
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,980
Alright, so we did...

753
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,880
We did the omelette.

754
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,120
What do I need for the cheese and crackers?

755
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,300
I don't think we have that.

756
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,920
And three cheese slice.

757
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:02,960
We don't...

758
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,160
Wait, we don't have crackers.

759
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,160
One.

760
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,740
Oh no!

761
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,910
Wasting a whole wedge for this.

762
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,870
Can I just cut off one?

763
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:19,870
No.

764
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:20,570
Okay.

765
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,970
Yeah, we'll go into the pantry and we will explore.

766
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,070
Alright.

767
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,210
I keep forgetting to show it.

768
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:33,650
Crackers!

769
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,850
Any crackers in here?

770
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,610
Wait, it says...

771
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,010
What does it say for the demon?

772
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,770
We could bring my...

773
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,280
If you're quick enough, you might catch a glimpse of this
little demon.

774
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,880
Sure likes making messes.

775
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,060
Okay, let's bring our camera.

776
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,260
See if we can get them.

777
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,700
Any crackers?

778
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,280

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,720
Oh, there's mushroom.

782
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,300
Okay, the things are in here.

783
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,630

784
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,110
Oh my gosh.

00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,010

788
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,030
The button.

789
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,070
What's happening?

790
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,550

795
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,500

796
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,980

00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,620
Okay, I'm leaving.

Awesome.

801
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,460
Gulba wants three tastes of Italy.

802
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,600
Okay, but I need crackers though.

803
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,160
Where can I get crackers from?

Mouse facts.

820
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,520
Mouse love grains, seeds, nuts, bacon, chocolate, peanut
butter, and ghosts.

821
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,860
Especially floofy-eared ghosts who work as maids.

00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,190

00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,880
I like him kicking his feet.

833
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,760
This is literally me, baby.

834
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,100
Pants!

835
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,080
He's pants!

836
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,540
You're just pants.

837
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,140
Who are you?

838
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,960
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

839
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,240
One specific dish.

840
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,620
Took me a while to figure out what he wants.

841
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,020
so I keep his favorite snack stashed away from the other
critters.

842
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,330
Okay.

843
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:56,790
Okay.

844
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,970
Is he just gonna hang around?

845
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:02,610
Stashed?

846
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,650
Wait, was there anything in here?

847
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,050
Oh, yeah.

848
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,260
Maybe it's something we haven't unlocked yet?

849
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,040
There's still, like, this?

850
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,880
Oh, that looks like a coffee, though, or something.

851
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,320
Or in here?

852
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,920
This one has nothing written, so let's...

853
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,440
The crackers were stashed.

854
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,440
Yes, they were.

855
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,320
Uh, I don't even see any.

856
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,860
Oh, here they are.

857
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:30,860
Let's try.

858
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,200
Do you like this?

859
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:33,580
No.

860
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,380
Okay.

861
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,980
Anyway, what's in here?

862
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,020
Ooh, enter the bedroom.

863
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,420

00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,920
We got chocolate bar and chocolate chip cookies.

867
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,560
Music's getting a little creepy.

868
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,920
We got this side up.

869
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:11,970
Okay.

870
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,590

We got chipies.

872
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,910
We got another recipe for chocolate ice cream.

873
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,650
We got a book.

874
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:23,510
Is that right?

875
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:25,610
Is that...

876
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,210
Huh.

877
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,190
A coffee maker!

878
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:29,210
Weather...

879
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:29,430

Monday.

884
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,950
Clouds rolling in all day with a little sun.

885
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,120

ground.

893
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,770
Did I kill these ones?

894
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:33,970
Wait, yeah.

895
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,430

Thanks, Weatherminto.

901
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:47,410
Of course, that will be the forecast for your forecasting
area.

902
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,590
Boo berries.

903
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,770
Happy wanderings, my dear.

904
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:58,510
I feel my or rather our friends in the shadows holding
trepidation in their hearts.

905
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:09,570
farewells are a challenge I am quite loath to be the proctor
of looking at dancing pale eyes a question lingers how did I

906
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:16,750
arrive many dozens of crescents have soared above to the
point those memories are blurred a question that needs

907
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:26,170
answering sooner than later for this family what are you
talking about grandma got strawberry ice cream oh

908
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,310
There's an alien in this box!

909
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,470
Oh, I don't have a camera.

910
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,290
Wait, how did that happen?

911
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,750
Oh, pants is gone!

912
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:41,930
It took too long!

913
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,430
Oh!

914
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:46,530
Oh, Jake!

915
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,930
We all know Jake!

916
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,950
We all know Jake!

917
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,870
I think this is a better one.

918
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,130
There we go.

919
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,070
Jake, silly Jake.

920
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,840
See this one?

921
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,160
Oh, he wants three varieties of dessert.

922
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,120
Oh, best not to move the boxes.

923
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,680
I think it's stressed when things change around it.

924
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,280
Okay, let's see.

925
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,680
I'm getting a little ahead of myself, I feel.

926
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,560
They're huge!

927
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,020
I hope there's only two of them.

928
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,400
Not mice.

929
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,460
Guess I should clean up after myself.

930
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,400
Oh yeah, he's going to eat the food on the ground.

931
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,200
Two sandwiches.

932
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,960
Lives under the house.

933
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,200
Gotta remember to take the trash out.

934
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,820
Running on two legs?

935
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:41,980
Okay.

936
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,960
But we have Gooberry right now, so we can do the three
tastes of Italy, I think.

937
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:48,760
What's that?

938
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,080
Like, spaghetti, pizza, Alfredo?

939
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:53,880
Probably.

940
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,260
Probably, right?

941
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,460
Spaghetti, Alfredo, pizza?

942
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,040
Let's do Alfredo first.

943
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,560
Cheese.

944
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,440
And milk.

945
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,680
And pasta.

946
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:12,800
Oh.

947
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:13,300
Oh.

948
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,040
Milk?

949
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,620
Oh, wait.

950
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,020
I have to mix the milk and the cheese, right?

951
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,320
Yeah.

952
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,000
Cheese wedge, please.

953
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,840
Not lettuce.

954
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:29,560
Cheese.

955
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:30,800
No!

956
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:31,940
Oh, nice.

957
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,660
Okay.

958
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,680
What does the red X on the food mean?

959
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,380
What red X?

960
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,020
Cheese.

961
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:54,980
Cheese sauce.

962
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,640
This bite of Italy is a tad too rich for me.

963
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:00,940
Uh-oh.

964
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,420
When you look at the recipe box.

965
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,280
Oh, look.

966
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,640
It says it does not stand close.

967
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,880
Oh, like this?

968
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,700
Oh, this means that we've made it before.

969
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,820
Oh, yum.

970
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,480
Spaghetti Alfredo pizza sounds kind of like an interesting
pizza.

971
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,760
Oh, I was just talking to a friend earlier about...

972
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,320
My crackers!

973
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:33,980
I was just talking to my friend about a mac and cheese
pizza.

974
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,160
Oh, he's eating it!

975
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,210
Okay, that's one.

976
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:52,450
Hey, get in your hole!

977
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,250
Get in your hole!

978
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,730
Don't eat the chocolate!

979
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,670
Or anything else.

980
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,550
We got one.

981
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,570
Let's make a pizza.

982
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,430
I'm feeling so Italian.

983
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,410
Oh no, we'll make spaghetti.

984
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:05,170
Pasta.

985
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:07,770
Does pasta stay in the fridge?

986
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,390
Because it's like...

987
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,150
Already cooked?

988
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,930
I guess not.

989
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,550
It was in the...

990
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,990
The cabinet, right?

991
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,170
Oh.

992
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:37,400
pasta pasta plus tomato sauce and ground beef mix raw steak
and salt okay we got a raw steak here um where was the salt

993
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:48,060

had to make a we had to make some other stuff like the

994
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:56,300
tomato sauce i remember I don't have anything of substance
to say, but I received my first credit card today.

995
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,240
Can't pay for supertats on that one, but it's crazy.

996
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,020
Maple pancake, thank you!

997
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,520
Now you're gonna use that responsibly, right?

998
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,180
You're gonna use that responsibly, right?

999
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,160
Oh, beef.

1000
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,640
And tomato.

1001
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,780
I think we need more salt.

1002
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,380
I'm working on it.

1003
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,680
I'm working on it.

1004
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,520
If I miss a puzzle, feel free to be like, hey, by the, like,
if I'm like, I don't know what to do, you could be like, by

1005
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,200
the way, you forgot this puzzle.

1006
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,360
Supporting Minto is responsible.

1007
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,440
No.

1008
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,000
No.

1009
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:52,850
Skiety time.

1010
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:59,770
Minto's homemade spaghetti in the oven of space and time and
time.

1011
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:06,650
I think you left something in the bucket under the sink.

1012
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,010
Oh, that looks good.

1013
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:11,950
Hey!

1014
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,260
Do you like to cook?

1015
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,060
I shouldn't cook.

1016
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,280
That'd be bad, Drew.

1017
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,120
Thank you so much for the fun.

1018
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:23,600
Get that!

1019
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,020
The credit card company told me that the super chats are
free.

1020
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,180
Just...

1021
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,840
They're trying...

1022
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,200
They're doing...

1023
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,540
They're bamboozling you!

1024
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,640
Oh, you're right.

1025
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,120
Oh, my gosh.

1026
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,560
There's a meatball sub in there.

1027
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,620
Is that Italian?

1028
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,780
It's fine.

1029
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,440
We were making a pizza anyway.

1030
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,200
It's a pizza, pizza, pizza.

1031
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,240
Cheese slice, tomato sauce, dough.

1032
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,280
Good thing we have a cheese slice right here.

1033
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,220
And we know how to make dough.

1034
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,460
Flour.

1035
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,560
Water.

1036
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,480
I'm house sitting, but I don't think I'm very good at it.

1037
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,000
I just leave all of my doors open.

1038
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,840
Being so responsible.

1039
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,880
Thank you.

1040
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,740
Would love a magic oven.

1041
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,980
I think everybody would love a magic oven like that, no?

1042
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,280
Just throw a bunch of stuff in there.

1043
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,100
But what if you keep making mistakes?

1044
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,740
It seems very specific, no?

1045
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,600
It seems like you need to get everything the proper...

1046
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,360
the proper amount of everything

1047
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,710
I want to see what a mistake is though we'll just throw some
stuff in maybe

1048
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:14,200
do they just have things no okay did I grab everything out
of everything sugar I'll throw that down there broth okay

1049
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:21,700
broth discovered alright throw that there tomato tomato I
think so now.

1050
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,880
Pizza, pizza, pizza, from Italia.

1051
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,900
With great streams come great responsibility.

1052
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,560
Or am I thinking of something else?

1053
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,420
Jack, thank you!

1054
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,880
Thank you so much for one year.

1055
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,100
Oh.

1056
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,920
We got ourselves a key, baby.

1057
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,420
Hi, Minto.

1058
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:55,000

Put seeds in hole.

1064
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,150
Cover seeds with dirt.

1065
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,190
Water grants life.

1066
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,610
Oh, it's probably that...

1067
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,870
It's probably the...

1068
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:10,650
What's it called, right?

1069
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,190
That grave that we saw.

1070
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,790
Cue banjo music.

1071
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,530
Bang, bang, bang.

1072
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,300
Come here.

1073
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:25,960
Thank you!

1074
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,920
A full invention.

1075
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:30,980
What is this?

1076
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,220
Oh, is it one of these?

1077
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,160
Oh, okay, okay.

1078
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,060
Oh.

1079
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,220
Oh!

1080
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,680
I was so close.

1081
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,460
Nachos!

1082
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,220
Oh, we got the seeds!

1083
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:49,600
Okay.

1084
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:50,560
What did it say?

1085
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,060
Rose seeds.

1086
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:53,960
Okay.

1087
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,160
But it, um...

1088
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:57,800
So, shovel.

1089
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,140
Let's go dig that hole.

1090
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,080
Right?

1091
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,200
He loves me!

1092
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,200
He's not running away!

1093
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,700
I'm just kidding, he's running away.

1094
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,860
I wonder if there's different types of mushroom.

1095
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,900
Like that one looks mysterious.

1096
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,040
Oh wait, where'd my shovel go?

1097
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,340
Glad I wasn't the only one thinking of Outer Wild's music.

1098
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,400
What seeds?

1099
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,140
I know the order.

1100
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,260
There are five mushrooms.

1101
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,320
There are?

1102
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,440
Well, we got the big guy.

1103
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,480
That was a big mushroom.

1104
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,980
This looks like the same big mushroom.

1105
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,600
I wonder if we use the dog toy on the...

1106
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,580
Oh wait, there's another one.

1107
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:48,980
Mushroom discovered.

1108
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,320
Oh, I think they are different.

1109
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,740
So yeah, this was a different kind of mushroom.

1110
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,920
Carrot on the ground.

1111
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,980
I'm like making such a mess.

1112
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,460
I wonder if we use the dog toy on the dog.

1113
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,040
House.

1114
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,160
Come here, boy!

1115
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,540
The skinniest dog ever!

1116
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,060
Wait.

1117
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,460
I can't see you!

1118
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,220
He's all... He looks all... He looks like a twig!

1119
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:21,960
Stick bugged!

1120
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:22,760
Stick dogged!

1121
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,740
Oh my god!

1122
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,480
It's worse than I thought.

1123
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,960
Let me do it for you!

1124
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,600
Oh, and he's really cute!

1125
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,760
I wish I could pet him.

1126
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,720
Let me do it for you.

1127
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,980
Let me do it for you.

1128
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,820
Yeah, he's hungry for sure.

1129
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,760
We'll feed that guy.

1130
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,080
Um, what was I working on?

1131
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,240
Okay, so we just got a goober.

1132
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,640
Little silly goober.

1133
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,400
Oh, I gotta take a picture of him.

1134
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,080
What do you want?

1135
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,760
stretch.

1136
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:05,960
Gray!

1137
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:07,420
Aww.

1138
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,880
Oh, I was planting the rose.

1139
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,420
You're so right.

1140
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,100
Whoa.

1141
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,020
Whoa.

1142
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,620
He's my friend.

1143
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,480
It's all spooky.

1144
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,640
I wonder if who's decorating these?

1145
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,940
Us or them?

1146
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,420
Jake.

1147
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,580
Jake wants three varieties of dessert.

1148
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,340
He wants three meals with beef.

1149
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,960
This thing has been here a long time.

1150
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,680
And then we still gotta do the picnic.

1151
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,040
Haven't gotten that one yet.

1152
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:41,600
I know.

1153
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,740
I hope they update the game where you can pet the animals
once they're your friends, you know.

1154
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,520
Oh, there it is.

1155
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,780
We planted this.

1156
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,640
Did I plant it?

1157
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,480
I don't think I did.

1158
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,520
Yes, I did.

1159
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,700
Oh, I just threw the whole packet in.

1160
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,340
Okay, good.

1161
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,100
And then we water it.

1162
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:14,690
Water, water, water.

1163
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:19,510
Oh, I think I need to put water on it.

1164
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,630
That would make sense.

1165
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,660
Come on, you got this?

1166
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:34,260
Oh!

1167
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,600
What you grilled cheese!

1168
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,660
Oh my god!

1169
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,700
Oh, there's water in it.

1170
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,000
Okay, good, good.

1171
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:46,800
Oh!

1172
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,120
Oh, water is last.

1173
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,320
Wait, my shovel, though.

1174
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,460
Wait, hold on.

1175
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:54,140
Run.

1176
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:00,740
Oh, whoa.

1177
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,060
Oh!

1178
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,200
Meatloaf!

1179
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,780
That probably requires a beef, you know?

1180
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,140
This game is so cozy.

1181
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,420
Oh, oops.

1182
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,040
I forgot where I was going.

1183
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,320
Oh.

1184
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:23,310
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

1185
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,280
beauty and the beast.

1186
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,200
Oh, the dog is kind of scary when he walks around.

1187
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,140
You're a good boy.

1188
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,380
Are you shaking?

1189
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,380
Oh, he's hungry.

1190
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,720
Wait, are you afraid of this?

1191
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:43,660
You don't...

1192
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,620
Lana, thank you so much for the read the book.

1193
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:48,800
Thank you.

1194
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:49,500
Hello, hello.

1195
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,620
Cool, are we romancing?

1196
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,020
We're romancing.

1197
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:54,460
Jake.

1198
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:56,840
Come on, Jake.

1199
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,440
You want three desserts.

1200
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,340
Oh my god!

1201
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,720
He had a burger under his box!

1202
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,600
Oh my gosh.

1203
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,220
Okay, so we do have this owl puzzle.

1204
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,660
I don't know quite yet.

1205
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:12,500
What is...

1206
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,260
Oh!

1207
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:17,380
Oh.

1208
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,340
Oh, I think it's another one of these.

1209
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,360
Oh!

1210
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,780
Okay, okay.

1211
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,140
Oh, it literally has numbers with the leaves.

1212
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,760
I just saw.

1213
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,100
I play play.

1214
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,280
Oh, I didn't discover what the, I didn't see what the recipe
was.

1215
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,640
I was brute forcing it, but there's literally leaves with
numbers on them.

1216
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:55,900
Oopsie.

1217
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,140
I love brute forcing stuff, though.

1218
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,160
I just noticed that this is like a butterfly on some
bananas.

1219
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:07,200
I'm not quite sure the meaning of it all.

1220
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,500
Grandma has some...

1221
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,920
Grandma's erred.

1222
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,420
Grandma has some...

1223
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,840
Oh, there's water in here.

1224
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,320
She has some interesting taste, huh?

1225
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,200
Wait, what if grandma really is dead?

1226
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:25,300
What if the ghost that we saw at the beginning was grandma
leading us to the house so that we could feed her friends?

1227
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,840
Because they will be hungry without her, and she actually
did die.

1228
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:45,470
isn't a flower everybody our final meal we will be eating
grandma crayon me thank you so much for the vibe get this

1229
01:08:45,470 --> 01:09:01,630
would have grandma's pants what a sentence grandma she's
pants she's pants oh my gosh this clock really is accurate

1230
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:06,510
that's scary immersive okay let's work on

1231
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:15,710
Before we get this guy, let's do Jake.

1232
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:24,010
Actually, actually, I realize this guy might give us a key
to unlock another ingredient, you know, so rather than a

1233
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:24,370
door.

1234
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,750
So we'll turn, never turn down a dimly lit picnic.

1235
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:33,180
Where?

1236
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,300
I didn't see a picnic.

1237
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,040
Is it out here?

1238
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,020
Oh!

1239
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:37,360
Oops.

1240
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,720
Oh, here it is.

1241
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,240
Here it is.

1242
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,020
Mason jar.

1243
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,580
And a recipe.

1244
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,540
Mushroom stir-fry.

1245
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,900
Right-click to gather.

1246
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:51,420
Oh!

1247
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,600
How sweet!

1248
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,320
Wait.

1249
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:03,240
I've lost.

1250
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:03,860
Oh, here it is.

1251
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:09,930
Uh-oh.

1252
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:14,510
Hopper!

1253
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,850
Mix the ashes with the flower and apple to make grandma's
apple pie.

1254
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,710
You would not believe your eyes.

1255
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,090
You would not believe your eyes.

1256
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:30,070
You would not believe your eyes.

1257
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,470
Oh, I don't think this guy...

1258
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,710
This guy would not believe his eyes.

1259
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,570
Oh, there's something else over here.

1260
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:40,370
Fish.

1261
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,430
We don't have fish yet.

1262
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,220
It's so beautiful.

1263
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:51,660
Is there anything else?

1264
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,700
What else is out here?

1265
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,240
We came from this way, no?

1266
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,120
But it seems a lot longer than when we first started.

1267
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,280
Oh, I don't think I can go any further.

1268
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,560
Oh, another type of mushroom.

1269
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:07,360
Yes.

1270
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,680
Very good.

1271
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,540
I think I've discovered every mushroom type.

1272
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,140
Perhaps.

1273
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,360
That frog he ate grandma's apple pie.

1274
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,580
Good morning, Mitao.

1275
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,700
Good morning.

1276
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,380
Alright, what's the frog want?

1277
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:37,280
Hopper wants two dishes from the yard.

1278
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,520
What?

1279
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:52,780
Mushroom dishes?

1280
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,000
That's what I was thinking.

1281
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:07,420
perhaps we do have a mushroom stir-fry pasta butter

1282
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:29,730
butter pasta our pantry is really filling out I was thinking
either from ingredients in the yard or recipes we found in

1283
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:35,090
the yard but I can't remember what maybe I feel like we
found the Mushroom stir-fry in the yard, right?

1284
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:37,570
Mushroom slice times two.

1285
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:38,870
Bread, bread.

1286
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:40,030
Mushroom slice one.

1287
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,410
Yes, very good.

1288
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,830
Sorry, it's a little stale.

1289
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:50,150
Yeah, it could be either one.

1290
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,230
We'll figure it out.

1291
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:59,490
Hopefully ingredients.

1292
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:00,310
I hope so, too.

1293
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:06,850
Why is my flashlight going out?

1294
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:10,550
Oh, it looks terrible.

1295
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,690
That's not my best work, everybody.

1296
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:15,190
I apologize.

1297
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,610
It's not my best work at all.

1298
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,180
Hello?

1299
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,320
Oh, my God.

1300
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,240
Oh, my God.

1301
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,580
Oh, he loved it!

1302
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:31,280
Okay, and he only wants two things, so we'll do another
mushroom dish.

1303
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,520
A good chef blaves their oven.

1304
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,320
Run.

1305
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,650
Alright.

1306
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:44,250
Mushroom stir fry.

1307
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,780
Do we have anything else with mushroom?

1308
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,400
Nachos.

1309
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,360
When did I get that?

1310
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,720
Frogs only want two things.

1311
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,100
They're disgusting.

1312
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,060
Oh, the shed.

1313
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:19,840
Oh, okay.

1314
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:26,920
There was something else that I made with a mushroom slice?

1315
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,180
But I don't remember what it was.

1316
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,780
Oh, it's the omelet.

1317
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,020
I don't know.

1318
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:44,480
Do you guys think it's...

1319
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,080
What's something that I found in the yard?

1320
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,500
Another recipe.

1321
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,940
I guess nachos we found technically in the shed, right?

1322
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,880
Did you check the rain gutter near the rose?

1323
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:00,240
No.

1324
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,200
Oh, the carrot!

1325
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,220
Oh!

1326
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,540
Mushroom soup!

1327
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,540
Oh, that hits both things.

1328
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,960
From the yard and also...

1329
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:18,580
Okay, cool.

1330
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:19,460
Thank you.

1331
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,460
Whoever said that.

1332
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,160
Yippee!

1333
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,840
Broth, mushroom slice to potato slice.

1334
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,900
Wait, do I have potatoes?

1335
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,760
I must, right?

1336
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:36,740
Because I must, because we have a French fry recipe.

1337
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,120
Mushroom slice.

1338
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:43,860
Potatoes?

1339
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:45,920
Any taters?

1340
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,640
What is that?

1341
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,020
That looks like a mushroom.

1342
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:50,880
Oh, here we go, potato.

1343
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,440
Who let the minky in the kitchen?

1344
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,140
I'm so sorry I just woke up.

1345
01:15:59,180 --> 01:15:59,920
No, you're all good.

1346
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:00,620
It's 4 a.m.

1347
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:00,820
here.

1348
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,660
Today's my birthday.

1349
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,920
Ah, happy birthday.

1350
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,720
This slice is for you.

1351
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,260
I need one more mushroom.

1352
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,580
One more mushroom.

1353
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,420
I'm going to chop.

1354
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,180
I'm feeling the rage.

1355
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,020
Oh.

1356
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,160
What was this again?

1357
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,100
Oh, toast.

1358
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,960
I had to blow my nose!

1359
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,940
Hold on.

1360
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,120
Make you rage.

1361
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,800
Oh, why does all the mushroom stuff look terrible?

1362
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,080
I bag it up.

1363
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,180
Full of love.

1364
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,240
Full of love for you, little frog.

1365
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:18,720
Oh my gosh.

1366
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,020
I want to see him run on his legs again.

1367
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:28,520
Wish I could cook gourmet meals by throwing random things in
a... in an oven.

1368
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,280
Kee!

1369
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,160
Thank you!

1370
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,320
Bye bye, Hopper!

1371
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,040
Bye bye!

1372
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,180
I know, this game... Oh, we get the freezer!

1373
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,620
This game is like a simulation almost, but like, it's just
so fantasy.

1374
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,100
It makes me so sad.

1375
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:47,980
Ice.

1376
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,800
Is there anything in the... Oh, I see.

1377
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,020
Recipe!

1378
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,640
Oh, vanilla ice cream!

1379
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,180
I can't see in there, so...

1380
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,240
Put that back in.

1381
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,620
Yeah, and put you back.

1382
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,320
Oh, that's sugar.

1383
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,580
We're gonna throw the other bag.

1384
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,940
Now we can make all the ice cream recipes.

1385
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:10,720
Yahoo!

1386
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:18,350
Very fast.

1387
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:19,690
Loves the fireflies.

1388
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:20,650
Ribbit.

1389
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,190
I want to see him walk more.

1390
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:45,110
how rippeting ribbit firefly from honky star rail then that
guy would be a duck not a frog three varieties of dessert

1391
01:18:46,750 --> 01:19:00,470

cream count or does he want like ice cream cookies and pie

1392
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:03,910
you know Is he picky like that?

1393
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:04,910
Hmm.

1394
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:09,510
Maybe it's like three different kinds.

1395
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:10,730
This one's easy.

1396
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:12,950
Milk, ice, sugar, chocolate bar.

1397
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:13,650
In the oven.

1398
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,190
Wait, we're putting the...

1399
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:16,790
Wait, we're putting the...

1400
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:20,370
We are putting the...

1401
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,150
The ice cream in the oven.

1402
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:24,870
Sugar, chocolate bar.

1403
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:25,810
Oh wait, sugar here.

1404
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:26,990
Oops.

1405
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,170
Oops.

1406
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:29,530
Oops.

1407
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:30,230
Oops.

1408
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:30,990
Oops.

1409
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:33,070
Chocolate.

1410
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:36,330
Checks out.

1411
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:51,130
That looks good.

1412
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:52,550
Jake!

1413
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:56,730
How does he eat it?

1414
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:00,270
Oh!

1415
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:02,330
Oh no!

1416
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:05,030
Cool.

1417
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:07,690
Alright, that's one.

1418
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,050
Let's then do...

1419
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:11,310
cookies.

1420
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:23,010
Sugar, chocolate, bar i like i just keep all the things open

to fry much thing many things the oven does it for us but um

1423
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,560
Once we run out of stuff, I can just shut the door and
refresh.

1424
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,120
Selly, I want fried ice cream.

1425
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,600
Oh, I want fried ice cream.

1426
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,480
Wait, oh, I took a bite of that one.

1427
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,440
If anybody gets fried ice cream, tell me.

1428
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,480
I'll come possess you.

1429
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,820
Please, I hope you don't want it because I want it instead.

1430
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,820
I think that was extra stinky today, I could tell.

1431
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,760
That's so rude.

1432
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:24,820
I know I need to shower.

1433
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,760
but like...

1434
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,800
Come on!

1435
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,240
Alright, let's do it.

1436
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,540
Blueberry...

1437
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,640
Pie.

1438
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:37,580
Yeah, I'm gonna do blueberry pie because I'm lazy and I
don't want to slice some apples.

1439
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:39,880
Blueberry!

1440
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:40,740
Yes.

1441
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,320
What else do I need?

1442
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,980
Sugar butter.

1443
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,910
What is it?

1444
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:04,390
A water.

1445
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:05,590
Water.

1446
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,870
I wonder how many friends are in this game.

1447
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,830
I think you go to the stir...

1448
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,430
I think I've been stirring it the wrong way.

1449
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:22,850
Do you like that umamusume gift, Minto?

1450
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:23,970
Which one?

1451
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:28,890
Which umamusume gift?

1452
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:31,910
Sweat.

1453
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,970
Oh, that looks so good.

1454
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,310
Sweating Minto is cute, too.

1455
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,250
I try to be clean.

1456
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,690
Oh, the Bakushin one!

1457
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,890
I have seen it.

1458
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,430
I have seen it.

1459
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:51,510
Give me my key.

1460
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:55,390
Oh don't...

1461
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,690
Wait, can I have it please?

1462
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:57,990
Oh thank you.

1463
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:01,350
Where does this go to?

1464
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,210
Not here.

1465
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:03,890
Oh!

1466
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:05,170
Coffee!

1467
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:09,490
Why is the coffee a skull?

1468
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:13,890
Steak and eggs.

1469
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:15,070
Ah!

1470
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,310
He's back!

1471
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:18,230
You're back, you're back!

1472
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,030
Pants!

1473
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:22,430
Um, you didn't even knock this time, rude?

1474
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:22,990
Okay.

1475
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:25,630
Uh, what does he want?

1476
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,070
I think it's in here.

1477
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:33,090
I think whatever he wants is in here.

1478
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,470
A bug.

1479
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,210
Can I put water in this?

1480
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:39,350
Oops.

1481
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:54,750
Ah!

1482
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:55,590
Sorry.

1483
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:01,070
I guess we'll wait.

1484
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,170
See if something comes.

1485
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:07,410
Maybe I need to put the Bigfoot mug out.

1486
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,470
What's this one?

1487
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:11,650
Oh, it's you!

1488
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:12,870
It's you!

1489
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:14,690
It's you, pants!

1490
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:16,270
You have your own mug!

1491
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:20,810
It's you!

1492
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:23,430
Aww!

1493
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,730
I wish I could sit with you.

1494
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:27,870
It would be so fun.

1495
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,170
I'm just sitting together.

1496
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:31,830
Gotta put this like in here.

1497
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:32,490
Alright.

1498
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,110
You want some toast?

1499
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:47,870
Then he waddle these out.

1500
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,250
Pants is my favorite.

1501
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:50,730
Umah.

1502
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:52,270
Me too.

1503
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:54,350
I miss him already.

1504
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,770
Oh, the cup and the coffee!

1505
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,310
This guy looks, maybe he's Bigfoot.

1506
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:06,230
He's got the big...

1507
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:09,430
The mug, maybe he wants the Bigfoot mug.

1508
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:11,990
My bad.

1509
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:13,050
Sorry.

1510
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:14,490
Sorry, Grandma.

1511
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,100
Oh,

1512
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:23,510
a cup of...

1513
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:25,170
Oh, I want some coffee now.

1514
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:38,550
A fresh one for ya!

1515
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:46,210
Bacon!

1516
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,810
Exit bacon!

1517
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:59,050
Oh my god.

1518
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:15,150
No?

1519
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:17,090
No good?

1520
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,250
Creamer?

1521
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:20,290
Sugar?

1522
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,440
I think we do have a big foot.

1523
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,360
Oh!

1524
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,060
Half life.

1525
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,200
Whoa.

1526
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,960
Okay, we'll just leave that right there for now.

1527
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:48,880
All right.

1528
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:49,720
Oh, my gosh.

1529
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,460
Oh, Jake.

1530
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,580
Is it a chicken?

1531
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,340
Very organized.

1532
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,420
The chicken portrait is so majestic.

1533
01:26:59,060 --> 01:26:59,720
Gray wants.

1534
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:01,400
three meals with beef.

1535
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,160
Oh, I have to take a picture.

1536
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:07,660
Come here, you.

1537
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,000
Say cheese.

1538
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:12,880
Sassfoot.

1539
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,060
Ooh, that's a good one.

1540
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:16,420
That's a really good one.

1541
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,080
That might be my best picture yet.

1542
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,360
Smells like beef.

1543
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,520
Sassfoot wants four breakfast items.

1544
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:30,680
Oof loves the smell of fresh coffee, but seems to hate the
taste.

1545
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:35,460
Oh, I hope the wind doesn't blow him off the branches.

1546
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,500
I remember that fish basket.

1547
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,860
This gent is such a hopeless romantic.

1548
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,600
He would always sing verses by the fire for a rose.

1549
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,020
We have the rose.

1550
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,240
You can feed Bigfoot.

1551
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,660
This game is so veto-coded.

1552
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,480
Few are graced by its presence.

1553
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,980
A true honor to be part of its gaze.

1554
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,020
It has been many years since I've been there.

1555
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:07,920
Since I've seen this friend about the evening's
ever-watching eye.

1556
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,420
You can watch their dances for hours, simply mesmerizing.

1557
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,120
So there's 16 friends we have.

1558
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,200
We're about almost halfway there.

1559
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,980
All right, nice.

1560
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,100
Okay, let's feed Gray.

1561
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,060
He wants some beef, baby.

1562
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,860
All right, well, we got a lot of stuff with beef in it,
though, so we got this.

1563
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:31,980
Taking a nap before work.

1564
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:32,720
Have a good stream.

1565
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:33,460
Thank you!

1566
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,640
Have a good nap.

1567
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,180
Was that sassy from Dexter's lab?

1568
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,960
All right, let's start at the beginning.

1569
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,880
What do we have that we haven't made also?

1570
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,600
Toast, pancakes, omelette.

1571
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:47,600
Eggs and bacon.

1572
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,740
Eggy sandal.

1573
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:51,980
Steak and eggs.

1574
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:52,560
Let's do that.

1575
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:53,600
Potato slice.

1576
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,000
Steak.

1577
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:57,760
Wait, did it say fried steak?

1578
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,680
Fried steak and fried egg.

1579
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,020
Okay.

1580
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:03,540
Oh, oh, oh, I didn't mean to do that.

1581
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,360
I'm nervous to have a date tonight!

1582
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,260
What if...

1583
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,440
There we go.

1584
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,860
What if it gets serious and she tells me I can't watch Minto
anymore?

1585
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,760
Quinn, no, that would never happen.

1586
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,900
Tell her to watch Minto too.

1587
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:23,500
Easy.

1588
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,460
Have fun on your date!

1589
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:28,360
Wait!

1590
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:33,760
What was this?

1591
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,340
Burnt egg!

1592
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:42,760
Aww!

1593
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:47,470
I didn't know you could do that.

1594
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,430
Yeah, convert her into Ibu.

1595
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:02,370
Okay, I'm...

1596
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:07,610
I'm scared.

1597
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:09,230
Oh!

1598
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:09,610
Oh!

1599
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:11,170
Easy, easy.

1600
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:12,730
Easy, easy.

1601
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:20,550
all right fried egg potato slice i think we have that
already potato slice

1602
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:35,550
soon everyone in the world will be eyeballing yes rip and
tear until it is done wow that is this a breakfast steak and

1603
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:42,290

1604
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:52,570
It's not for you!

1605
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:53,890
How do I feed you boy?

1606
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:55,510
There you go.

1607
01:30:58,670 --> 01:30:59,450
It's a classic.

1608
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:04,310
Good boy.

1609
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:07,230
Well, we'll just make it again for Sassy.

1610
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:11,450
All right, staking eggs.

1611
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,750
Consult our guardian about finding a new steward soon.

1612
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:17,290
I think I know just the person.

1613
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:18,330
Is it me?

1614
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:22,770
It's popular in the U.S.

1615
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:23,150
at least.

1616
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:27,770
Okay, let's do...

1617
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:31,830
Ground beef should work, right?

1618
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:34,770
And beef stew?

1619
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,110
We could do this one.

1620
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:41,170
I think I have another potato slice, actually.

1621
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:42,290
Red.

1622
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:42,790
Potato.

1623
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:44,550
Potato.

1624
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:46,450
Uh...

1625
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:47,210
Carrot.

1626
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:50,770
Broth and steak.

1627
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:58,830
Oh yeah, that was close.

1628
01:32:01,070 --> 01:32:01,550
Perfect.

1629
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,210
The soundtrack in this game is like too good.

1630
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:11,950
Making me a little emotional as we like cook for our
friends.

1631
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,770
It's kind of so sweet, no?

1632
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:17,750
We're cooking for our friends and we have this nice
soundtrack happening.

1633
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:21,430
Oops.

1634
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:28,080
Carol.

1635
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,900
That was a beef stew.

1636
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,120
And our fridge says node.

1637
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,480
It's this game was made for me maybe.

1638
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,220
Oh, that looks awesome.

1639
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:43,680
Come here, boy.

1640
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:44,200
Oh.

1641
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:45,700
Hey, boy.

1642
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,080
No.

1643
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:49,860
I'll put it in front of your house.

1644
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:59,660
Oh my god, he's so fast.

1645
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:07,500
All right, one more beef thing for you.

1646
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,660
Where's Sash?

1647
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,340
I heard him.

1648
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:17,960
What else do we want to make?

1649
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:21,240
Let's do the meatball sub.

1650
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:26,960
I think I have some bread slices in here somewhere.

1651
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:28,720
Bread slice?

1652
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,360
Bread slice?

1653
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:32,760
Perfect.

1654
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,780
Tomato sauce and ground beef.

1655
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,520
Organized chef.

1656
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,440
Absolutely.

1657
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,620
I know where everything is in my kitchen.

1658
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,460
Where is the salt?

1659
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:48,960
Salt.

1660
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:02,720
Nice.

1661
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,220
And tomato sauce.

1662
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:08,980
Oh, that's an apple.

1663
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,020
Spin.

1664
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,940
Is this making you hungry, guys?

1665
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,340
Do you think I could be a great chef?

1666
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:37,660
I'm just gonna throw things in the oven exactly as this is
right now.

1667
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,460
Art imitates life, therefore...

1668
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:43,940
Whoa!

1669
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,360
That looks juicy.

1670
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:51,080
Therefore, if I throw all my things...

1671
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:01,130
Hello?

1672
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:03,550
Oh, there we go.

1673
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:07,620
Wait.

1674
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:09,900
What is... What are you doing there?

1675
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,030
I can pet the dog!

1676
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:15,170
I can pet the dog!

1677
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:19,840
Don't run, please!

1678
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:20,880
Let me pet the dog!

1679
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:22,220
Hold on, let's open this.

1680
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:22,920
Okay.

1681
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:26,840
I can pet the dog!

1682
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:29,020
Where'd he go?

1683
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:33,170
Come here, stop running!

1684
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:34,890
Oh my god, he's like a real dog.

1685
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:36,610
Please, stop running!

1686
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:39,690
I can pet the dog!

1687
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:41,030
I can pet the dog!

1688
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,120
Oh, he's turning green.

1689
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,240
Oh, he turns green.

1690
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:55,540
Oh, my gosh.

1691
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,500
That is a real greyhound behavior.

1692
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,120
Makes you feel better.

1693
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:08,640
I was only vaguely aware steak and eggs for breakfast was a
thing.

1694
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,580
But Chikton, apparently there are tons of places around me
that serve it.

1695
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:12,540
No way!

1696
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:13,920
You could try it.

1697
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:15,880
I feel like steak is heavy on the tummy, no?

1698
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:19,800
Reassigning Minto to the mess hall team on Mother Base.

1699
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,120
Where was I assigned before?

1700
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:24,060
Entertainment?

1701
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:29,520
Nobody tell her a slow cooker is just an oven you throw
things into and get a fully cooked meal out of.

1702
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,400
You're right.

1703
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,660
Wait, wait, so I can throw it in, jar and all?

1704
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,980
Alright, we opened up this room.

1705
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,380
The bathroom.

1706
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,140
Read me, please.

1707
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:48,720
Midnight greetings, my dear.

1708
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:53,480
Watching misty fingers rise through trees, a strange thought
has taken haunt.

1709
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,880
A flavor of drowsiness now dances alongside the light in my
soul.

1710
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,260
The twilight whispers hold not a tinge of concern.

1711
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:07,520
And so I shall trust their calm as I prepare to rest until
the new steward's arrival.

1712
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:12,000
I think I was right, you guys.

1713
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:14,780
Fish and chips!

1714
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,480
A blue bead.

1715
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:17,860
Oh.

1716
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,360
Fish chowder.

1717
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,180
Why is all the fish stuff in the bathroom?

1718
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,120
Oh.

1719
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,660
Green bead.

1720
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:37,620
towels more towels chicken parm

1721
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:56,840
that scared me i think that's the thunder oh country fried
chicken don't tell me there's a fish at the toilet seat

1722
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:07,640
The blue bead goes into the blue bead hole and the green
bead goes into the green bead hole.

1723
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:13,080
And we have no other holes to...

1724
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:15,440
Hmm.

1725
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,280
Oh.

1726
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:18,760
Chicken noodle soup!

1727
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,900
Is this gonna flood?

1728
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:24,960
No.

1729
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:28,970
All right.

1730
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:32,870
Doesn't seem to be any friends in here, at least, though.

1731
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:36,470
We gotta find the red bead.

1732
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:38,710
Somewhere.

1733
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:41,790
The music in there is kind of creepy.

1734
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:44,130
All right.

1735
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:46,010
Let's make some breakfast items, yeah?

1736
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,790
Oh, very long.

1737
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:50,250
Just once big dinner.

1738
01:38:50,690 --> 01:38:52,070
I wonder if I can bring him inside.

1739
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:53,930
Not sure this is a dog.

1740
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:56,230
All right.

1741
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,430
I think we can bring him in.

1742
01:38:59,510 --> 01:38:59,730
Where's...

1743
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,370
Here, here, here.

1744
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:02,430
Come here, boy.

1745
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:17,470
But do we want the thing that we're not sure is a dog or not
inside?

1746
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:20,510
Um...

1747
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:24,630
Alright, we'll get Sasfoot, and then we'll try whatever the
heck this guy is.

1748
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:25,950
The fishy...

1749
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:27,470
Fishing basket.

1750
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:30,570
Should really feed him.

1751
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:31,070
I did!

1752
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:32,690
I gave him three whole meals!

1753
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:34,310
Ha ha ha!

1754
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:39,710
Big dog or short deer.

1755
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:42,810
Wait, four breakfast items.

1756
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:43,910
Holy cow.

1757
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:44,370
Okay.

1758
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:46,490
Hungry, hungry, hungry.

1759
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:50,550
Does toast count?

1760
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:52,930
Toast is a breakfast item, no?

1761
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:00,430
I got him in!

1762
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:02,870
Hey boy, hey boy.

1763
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:03,990
Yeah.

1764
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,530
He's in!

1765
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:13,110
Time for steak.

1766
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:15,430
Pancakes count for sure.

1767
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,370
Pancakes have to count.

1768
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:22,730
All my friends are just walking around.

1769
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:25,450
It's in water.

1770
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,250
Pancakes.

1771
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:44,490
We need maple syrup.

1772
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:02,090
Why does my flashlight do that?

1773
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:07,310
Cats and dogs living together.

1774
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:09,550
Mass hysteria.

1775
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:14,110
Yeah, but a cat raised by a dog is like the funniest thing
ever.

1776
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:16,770
Hey there, boy.

1777
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:22,230
Hello!

1778
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:23,570
Sass!

1779
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:25,210
Oh, there you are.

1780
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,320
Oh yeah.

1781
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,780
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1782
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,180
Alright, pancakes.

1783
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:42,630
Did you ever see the video of a cat raised by horses?

1784
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:43,190
No!

1785
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:44,890
How?

1786
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:47,590
How does that even work?

1787
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:49,310
A cat raised by horses.

1788
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:51,650
Alright, pancakes.

1789
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:52,270
Omelette.

1790
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:53,790
We could do an omelette too.

1791
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:55,090
Let's do that.

1792
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:57,910
We have a cheese slice.

1793
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:00,470
We have a mushroom slice.

1794
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:01,750
I'm getting rid of my slices.

1795
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:02,450
This is good.

1796
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:06,050
Uh, carrot, potato...

1797
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:08,230
Tomato slice?

1798
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:10,750
Oh, nice, nice.

1799
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,350
Now we just need to fry our egg.

1800
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:14,350
Easiest ever.

1801
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:17,330
I want to make new things, though.

1802
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:22,050
I don't want to just...

1803
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:25,050
I'm trying not to...

1804
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:26,550
Oh, nice, okay.

1805
01:42:30,650 --> 01:42:31,130
Yippee!

1806
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:37,670
If I get close, does anything happen?

1807
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:44,750
I guess nothing happens.

1808
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:46,030
Homelet.

1809
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:51,570
Sayus.

1810
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:54,490
Are you out here?

1811
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:56,470
Sayus.

1812
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,120
Sayus.

1813
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:10,720
Where is my friend?

1814
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:12,600
Where is Bigfoot?

1815
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:17,900
Where is Bigfoot?

1816
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,440
By the coffee?

1817
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:20,960
No.

1818
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,220
I like that it's gone cold now.

1819
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,680
It doesn't have like a...

1820
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:27,960
Oh, there you are!

1821
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:35,480
The search for Bigfoot is real.

1822
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,060
Alright, that's Tool?

1823
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,140
Alright.

1824
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,080
Bacon!

1825
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:46,380
We haven't made that one actually.

1826
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,040
Let's fry some bacon.

1827
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:48,400
Oh wait.

1828
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,200
Oh no no not raw.

1829
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:56,600
Oh no.

1830
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:57,540
Hey.

1831
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,140
Oh no.

1832
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:05,290
Oh.

1833
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:07,570
Oh.

1834
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:09,030
Oh.

1835
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:11,370
Oh.

1836
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:14,710
Oh.

1837
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:14,990
Oh.

1838
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:15,050
Oh.

1839
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:15,070
Oh.

1840
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:15,150
Oh.

1841
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:15,230
Oh.

1842
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:15,250
Oh.

1843
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:16,530
You don't like it.

1844
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:17,890
That's a bad bacon.

1845
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,910
It's bad bacon.

1846
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:20,390
I'm sorry.

1847
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:21,670
I'm sorry.

1848
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:23,070
Okay, that was a vegan.

1849
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:25,870
He's like, I know you didn't mean it.

1850
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:29,430
I tried to give him bacon.

1851
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:31,450
Any dog would want bacon.

1852
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:36,660
Okay.

1853
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:39,180
And...

1854
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:39,480
And...

1855
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:40,640
Flip!

1856
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:42,480
Yes!

1857
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:46,860
Alright.

1858
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:48,460
One bacon?

1859
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:51,100
It is one bacon and one fried egg, yeah.

1860
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:53,520
Breakfast staple coming up.

1861
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:56,020
Yes, standards.

1862
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:04,030
Do you ever think about how you cook bacon but bake cookies?

1863
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:08,450
Minus two.

1864
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:11,310
Oops.

1865
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,770
I think he shows up every time he wants pets.

1866
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:19,330
I'm really bad at cooking these aren't.

1867
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:19,910
aren't I?

1868
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,300
Oh, yay.

1869
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:42,050
Oh, I can stand close now.

1870
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:46,690
Bacon and eggs.

1871
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:48,330
Eggs and bacon.

1872
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:50,790
Where are you, sassy?

1873
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:52,170
I made this just for you.

1874
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:53,470
It's really delicious.

1875
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:54,730
A pack of protein.

1876
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:59,230
Don't just stand there, yo.

1877
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:02,480
All right, one more.

1878
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:05,550
Run.

1879
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:14,750
Um.

1880
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:20,210
Is grilled cheese breakfast?

1881
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:23,950
Is mayonnaise a breakfast?

1882
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:28,530
Uh.

1883
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:36,930
Chicken par We don't have any chicken I haven't gotten any
fish either Maybe after we feed Saris

1884
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:53,610
I feel like Grilled cheese sounds like a That's what dogs do
I feel like I feel like Grilled cheese sounds like a

1885
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:56,820
breakfast Also thank you Brandon For this to be dead Thank
you

1886
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:03,280
We did pay We did pancakes.

1887
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,560
We did omelette.

1888
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,740
We did eggs and bacon.

1889
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:07,520
You know what?

1890
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:08,600
Let's just try toast.

1891
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:10,780
It's so simple.

1892
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,920
It's so simple.

1893
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:22,590
And then we'll have lots of bread slices for anything that
we might need it for later.

1894
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:24,970
A classic.

1895
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:27,250
Simple toast.

1896
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:31,910
I'll give him an end slice of it.

1897
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:34,810
I hear him wandering.

1898
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:42,430
Do we have one more lock in here, so...

1899
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:44,650
I have to go.

1900
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:46,350
Thanks for the stream showing your cooking skills.

1901
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:48,850
As Italian, I'm really proud of you.

1902
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:51,050
Thank you, Bobius!

1903
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:53,150
Thank you.

1904
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:54,050
Good night.

1905
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:57,870
Did I say it right?

1906
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:58,570
Oh, here you go.

1907
01:47:58,990 --> 01:48:00,890
Oh, here you go.

1908
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:02,990
Oh!

1909
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:03,990
Oh!

1910
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:05,390
Oh!

1911
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:06,850
Ah, it worked!

1912
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:10,550
Thank you.

1913
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:13,150
Thank you, Bigfoot.

1914
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:16,330
What's his booty look like?

1915
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:16,890
Wow!

1916
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:17,990
Wow!

1917
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:20,470
That's a sizable romp!

1918
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:26,550
It does open up this one.

1919
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:27,170
Chicken!

1920
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:28,310
Oops.

1921
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:36,550
Why wouldn't... Let me... Oh, there we go.

1922
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:42,750
Balls?

1923
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:50,660
What's it mean, boy?

1924
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:53,460
What's it mean?

1925
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:03,160
Oh, for soup!

1926
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:06,800
Uh-oh.

1927
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:08,340
Wait, what just happened in my game?

1928
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,580
Uh, oh!

1929
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,340
My mouse just died!

1930
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:12,400
Wait, one second!

1931
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:16,660
I was like, wait, I can't move!

1932
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:25,260
I gotta plug up my mouse.

1933
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,260
It did say it was not.

1934
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,720
I thought it was gonna die sooner.

1935
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,500
It told me last night it was dying.

1936
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:33,820
It had been dying since before I started Bioshock.

1937
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:35,660
He...

1938
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:39,780
I've just been lazy about it.

1939
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:48,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1940
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,480
Plug in my mouse.

1941
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,860
Does that work?

1942
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:56,560
Seems like it.

1943
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,940
Seems like it.

1944
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:10,260
All right.

1945
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:19,580
This mouse lasts, you know, for as much as I am on my
computer and everything, this mouse lasts an incredibly long

1946
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,020
time.

1947
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,760
It's like, it's really awesome.

1948
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:30,400
You know, I always get kind of nervous about wireless stuff
because Having to charge it is kind of a bit of a pain,

1949
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:30,760
right?

1950
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,400
But this thing lasts forever.

1951
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:34,520
It's really awesome.

1952
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:38,320
Okay, we just got bowls.

1953
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:39,180
Let's see.

1954
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,700
We did sash foot.

1955
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,000
This one we don't have access to this room yet.

1956
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:47,100
And pants.

1957
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:50,160
And whatever is in all of these.

1958
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:51,520
Like, yeah, there's this...

1959
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,960
There's this lock too.

1960
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:56,200
To the ghost.

1961
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:04,820
Where'd you go?

1962
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:12,360
And then also...

1963
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:17,100
Will it come out of the toilet?

1964
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,740
We need the red one, the red bead.

1965
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,120
I'm assuming it's in here, right?

1966
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:29,600
Nice bathroom.

1967
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:30,540
Thank you.

1968
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:37,400
Does anyone else think this dog suits mint well?

1969
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:39,260
Why do you think that?

1970
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:41,400
What's your reasoning, huh?

1971
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,300
Can you open the cabinet?

1972
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:45,020
Yes,

1973
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,180
we can.

1974
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,360
Oh, the chicken!

1975
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:52,900
It's chicken burrito.

1976
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:08,760
Fish.

1977
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,380
Let's just close that.

1978
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,620
Anything else under these towels?

1979
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:24,400
Thank you to whoever told me to open this cabinet.

1980
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:27,000
I was too much of a dummy to even realize.

1981
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:31,780
Alright, so we got...

1982
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:36,140
Wait, let's go put the fish in the fish basket and see what
happens.

1983
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,040
Excuse me.

1984
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:45,740
Oh, but I probably need my camera, right?

1985
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,780
Oh, we'll go back for it.

1986
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:49,420
Ah!

1987
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:52,860
Oh, what are you doing up there?

1988
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,840
What are you doing up there?

1989
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:02,200
What?

1990
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,240
There's an octopus in the tree!

1991
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:15,390
Uh, camera.

1992
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:18,250
Oh, there we go.

1993
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,790
I feel like I've heard of this, like, legend though, an
octopus.

1994
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:26,510
It's, like, not an umah, but it's like...

1995
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:30,570
I think I remember making Valentine's cards based on this
guy.

1996
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:35,550
The Pacific Northwest tree Octopus.

1997
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:44,520
I think it used to be like a fake website.

1998
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:51,180
I don't think it's appropriate to use the toilet on stream.

1999
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:52,160
I'm so sorry.

2000
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:59,840
I think it used to be a fake website that was based off of
this, this, this octopus, right?

2001
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:06,140
Yeah, does someone else remember it?

2002
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,940
Oh my god.

2003
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:08,820
Say cheese.

2004
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:09,400
Gerald.

2005
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,980
Oh my gosh, Gerald!

2006
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:15,760
What do you want?

2007
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:18,000
You want some fishy fish stew?

2008
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,390
Oh, let me check.

2009
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:28,430
What you want first.

2010
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:38,510
Gerald wants four meats of sky or sea.

2011
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:42,790
Okay, so two chickens and two fish.

2012
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:44,490
Okay, we can do that.

2013
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,840
Fish and chips, coming right up.

2014
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:00,900
Uh, bread?

2015
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:07,960
Oh, potato slice one?

2016
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,840
So much bread.

2017
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:21,780
There's gotta be another potato slice in here.

2018
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:22,720
No?

2019
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:24,920
Cheese?

2020
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:28,060
Cheese, carrot?

2021
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:30,780
Okay, let's get...

2022
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:35,300
So it's potato, slice three, and fried fish.

2023
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:38,640
Is the fish going to be in here?

2024
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:39,540
No.

2025
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,380
We need some modern updates for those cryptid Valentine's
cards.

2026
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:44,440
I'd buy those.

2027
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:45,960
Maybe next year, right?

2028
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:49,720
Maybe I can make them next year.

2029
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:51,380
Fish.

2030
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,760
Wow, that sounds such a cute looking fish.

2031
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,700
It's like your stereotypical fish.

2032
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:11,340
I didn't know I didn't realize they would be in such demand
Let me pet you

2033
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:26,920
How is this game I've never even heard of it Is it scary?

2034
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:27,640
I can't handle it?

2035
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:35,040
No it's like a creepy But it's not there's no jump scares or
anything It's very cozy actually We're just cooking It's

2036
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:41,340
just kind of spooky vibes but it's not like a Jump scare or
in your face kind of spooky.

2037
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,220
Just creepy vibes.

2038
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,060
Fish and chips.

2039
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:50,840
For the octopus in the tree.

2040
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,820
Yeah, see, you got like big foot walking around.

2041
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,220
That's just a little goofy.

2042
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:57,180
Oh.

2043
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,060
Oh, he's so cute.

2044
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:09,420
Oh, my god.

2045
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:09,640
He's scared.

2046
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,180
turn me.

2047
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,480
Okay, maybe there are jump scares.

2048
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:13,580
Alright.

2049
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,480
He wanted two.

2050
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:20,460
I wish I could run through bushes.

2051
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,280
Oh my god, the dog.

2052
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:25,620
Alright, that was one fish.

2053
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:26,960
Let's do another fish.

2054
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:32,180
Fish.

2055
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:33,280
Fish chowder.

2056
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:36,280
Potato slice.

2057
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:37,100
Fried fish.

2058
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,840
I think we have one more potato slice.

2059
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:39,480
Nice.

2060
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:42,480
Uh, milk.

2061
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,860
Fried fish.

2062
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,960
Fish chowda.

2063
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:52,340
Hoi!

2064
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,660
Nice.

2065
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:01,320
And gravy.

2066
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:02,940
Butter and flour.

2067
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,040
Creepy, cozy, goofy, cute.

2068
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:07,140
Are we talking about this game or meinto?

2069
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,160
What are you talking about?

2070
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:10,720
Wait, what was it?

2071
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:11,760
Butter?

2072
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,060
Butter?

2073
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,040
Flower?

2074
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,860
I mean there is a demon in here.

2075
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:25,180
I think this is the scariest part of the game.

2076
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:35,060
My cord is going into my bowl.

2077
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,420
Gravy.

2078
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:40,800
I'll aboard the gravy train.

2079
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:45,680
Put a whole milk box in the oven.

2080
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:46,660
Nice.

2081
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,360
That's how we do it here.

2082
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,560
It's just...

2083
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,160
The oven has the right idea.

2084
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,360
The oven goes...

2085
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:54,760
Yes, you wanted fish chowder.

2086
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:56,960
Yes, yes.

2087
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,620
You wanted fish chowder, I understand.

2088
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,360
You safe.

2089
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:03,720
Oh, great oven.

2090
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,740
Make something with this.

2091
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:06,700
Oops.

2092
01:59:14,430 --> 01:59:17,490
Mayoshi is the goofiest, comfiest, cutest creep around.

2093
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:19,350
I don't think...

2094
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:20,350
Wait, no, I'm creepy.

2095
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:21,870
Scary.

2096
01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:45,330

2097
01:59:45,330 --> 01:59:53,490

chicken and potato slice.

2098
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:58,210
We got one last potato slice.

2099
01:59:59,430 --> 02:00:00,630
And fried chicken.

2100
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:05,210
Whoa!

2101
02:00:06,450 --> 02:00:06,670
Ooh!

2102
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:08,170
Oh my gosh.

2103
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:09,770
Flintstone's core.

2104
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:23,960
Can I pet that dog, Minto?

2105
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:25,140
You can pet the dog.

2106
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:25,620
Hold on.

2107
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:27,360
It kind of looks like a corn dog.

2108
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:28,700
Okay.

2109
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,120
Nice.

2110
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:36,860
Where'd my dog go?

2111
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,820
Come here, dog.

2112
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:45,900
What's her name, Gray?

2113
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,820
Ah, so cute.

2114
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:57,260
What else do we need?

2115
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,360
Gravy!

2116
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,780
Wow, so many eggs.

2117
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:23,460
I'd be all for smart appliances if they were like that oven.

2118
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:25,540
I would like to make friends with it.

2119
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:33,820
No, instead we have fridges that tell us that we have
tomatoes when it's really strawberries.

2120
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,660
I'm a freak.

2121
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:39,340
I'm an abu.

2122
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:42,400
That looks good.

2123
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:45,100
Some country fried chicken, y'all.

2124
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:49,860
Ye-ha!

2125
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:52,600
We're in the country.

2126
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:54,900
There you go.

2127
02:01:57,660 --> 02:02:00,080
I shouldn't hide here.

2128
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:05,500
Alright, one more chicken.

2129
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:10,300
Tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki.

2130
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,700
Tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki.

2131
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:14,200
I wonder if eggs count.

2132
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:35,960
pasta cheese slice we can do easy cheese slice pasta I think
then tomato and salt I believe bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep

2136
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:58,640
Do you like a PB&J?

2137
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:05,900
Who wants a raw chicken?

2138
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:07,480
No!

2139
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,160
Who wants a burnt chicken?

2140
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:15,680
I love grandpa raccoon.

2141
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:21,380
Who wants a raw chicken that I put in the fryer?

2142
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,160
Okay, here we go, here we go.

2143
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:27,180
In the middle, in the middle.

2144
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:34,200
It's not my fault.

2145
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,940
It's not my fault.

2146
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:38,380
Not now, dog.

2147
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:41,180
The game is giving me so much chicken.

2148
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:44,020
Okay.

2149
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:44,440
Okay.

2150
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:05,390
I ordered food from this place, but They keep telling me
they're ghost, but it keeps burning the food.

2151
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:10,170
I'm giving it out a four out of five with hopes for
improvement.

2152
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:12,330
You're so generous.

2153
02:04:13,470 --> 02:04:18,210
Yes, some of us are still being trained in the art of the
flip.

2154
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:23,670
Some like it crispy.

2155
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:26,230
That's honestly, this doesn't look so bad to me.

2156
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:27,490
It doesn't even look dry.

2157
02:04:30,330 --> 02:04:32,530
Why do I have to fry it before I put it in the oven?

2158
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:42,790
oven having accidentally eaten raw chicken before i would
advise against it raw chicken i think like raw beef seems

2159
02:04:42,790 --> 02:04:48,190
not doesn't seem so bad but raw chicken just seems like just
seems slimy and all

2160
02:04:52,230 --> 02:05:04,920
yippee it just doesn't seem appetizing what are your
thoughts on burnt marshmallow burnt the best.

2161
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:06,460
Whoa, that looks so good.

2162
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:07,540
Chicken parm.

2163
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:11,100
I love me.

2164
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:12,800
Oh, the burnt-er, the better.

2165
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:19,900
Give me carcinogens of the fire.

2166
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:22,340
So good.

2167
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:27,420
Yeah, when it's all gooey on the inside, but so burnt on the
outside.

2168
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:31,720
What do you have for me?

2169
02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:38,810
Thank you!

2170
02:05:39,930 --> 02:05:41,050
The moon key.

2171
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:45,050
I think this is our second to last key that we know of right
now.

2172
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:50,490
This opens the last room at least.

2173
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:53,830
Oh no, we have two more keys.

2174
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:56,410
The moon key.

2175
02:05:56,730 --> 02:05:56,850
Oh!

2176
02:05:58,650 --> 02:06:00,950
Like we have this one and then we have the...

2177
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:02,110
Oh hi!

2178
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:04,950
We have this one, which is...

2179
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:06,750
Wait.

2180
02:06:07,690 --> 02:06:08,450
Oh, no, just kidding.

2181
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:10,070
No, we do- oh, this is the bowl.

2182
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:11,610
What do you want?

2183
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:15,610
I forgot about that one.

2184
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:17,330
Um, pants.

2185
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:20,470
Something that was locked away.

2186
02:06:28,570 --> 02:06:29,870
Seems very wise.

2187
02:06:30,070 --> 02:06:31,110
Always in the same spot.

2188
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:32,410
How did he get there?

2189
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:44,510
It took me a while to figure out what this one wants, so I
keep his favorite snacks dashed away from the other

2190
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:44,890
critters.

2191
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:51,070
Yeah, let's try the slop.

2192
02:06:53,150 --> 02:06:54,710
No, he doesn't want to slop.

2193
02:06:57,570 --> 02:06:59,490
Maybe something comes out of it.

2194
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:00,650
Right?

2195
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:03,630
Is it always slop?

2196
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,190
I've thrown...

2197
02:07:09,190 --> 02:07:09,870
I've thrown...

2198
02:07:09,870 --> 02:07:12,270
I've thrown burnt chicken in there before.

2199
02:07:12,730 --> 02:07:13,510
Maybe it mutated.

2200
02:07:14,710 --> 02:07:16,130
Okay, why don't I give up?

2201
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:17,890
Slop gotcha.

2202
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:20,270
Let's try the black and white room.

2203
02:07:20,650 --> 02:07:23,190
Enter the oddities room.

2204
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:35,760
Oh, I can't get in there.

2205
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:40,830
There's an outside there too.

2206
02:07:41,990 --> 02:07:42,430
Heavy.

2207
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:53,470
Fruit salad.

2208
02:07:54,570 --> 02:07:54,890
Yummy.

2209
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:00,550
Gullab jamun?

2210
02:08:00,650 --> 02:08:01,270
What is that?

2211
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:01,650
What is that?

2212
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:02,350
Typewriter handle.

2213
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:04,510
Okay.

2214
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:05,290
What is that?

2215
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:05,530
Oops.

2216
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:07,810
Um, wait.

2217
02:08:08,050 --> 02:08:09,350
I meant to put it on the couch.

2218
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:10,130
Uh-oh.

2219
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:10,750
Wait.

2220
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:11,810
Oh.

2221
02:08:12,150 --> 02:08:12,370
Ah.

2222
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:13,870
Uh.

2223
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,610
Chips and guacamole.

2224
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:19,630
It's an Indian dessert.

2225
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:25,520
Oh!

2226
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:29,100
Did I soft-lock my- oh my god.

2227
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,000
The typewriter was literally right here.

2228
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:32,020
Avocado!

2229
02:08:36,650 --> 02:08:38,670
Um, there's a lost and found thing.

2230
02:08:38,730 --> 02:08:39,710
Let me see if it works.

2231
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:50,480
No!

2232
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:51,740
Stinking way!

2233
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:53,020
Oh my god.

2234
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:55,220
The game is kind.

2235
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:05,680
Ghost Rider.

2236
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:11,300
Once there was a wizard who came from old snake mouth.

2237
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:13,700
Went clockwise round the mountain.

2238
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:16,880
Landed one pace past due south.

2239
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:19,220
Done shopping at Lambtown.

2240
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:21,400
Trekked back the way he came.

2241
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:23,620
Grown in hand the man ended.

2242
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:26,640
north's flame.

2243
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:31,400
At sunset with bag and sword, the wizard made for east.

2244
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:36,440
His goal was the town named for beyond fields of evil
beasts.

2245
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:43,560
There we go.

2246
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:45,580
I know we got something here.

2247
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:49,020
I think I need to hang stuff here maybe?

2248
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:51,700
Hmm.

2249
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:57,000
Does it have to do with this?

2250
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:12,720
one past one pace past due south it's either this or the
clock right

2251
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:31,740
have you tried meugenics the dialogue is super funny the
game's fun too you know whether I was gonna actually play

2252
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:43,920
meugenics and then I was watching I watched like the trailer
and I was like I don't think I like how the cats are treated

2253
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:44,540
in the game.

2254
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:51,320
So, um, I decided against it.

2255
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:57,600
Because I was interested, um, with, like, the creator and
everything.

2256
02:10:58,780 --> 02:11:01,240
But the game just seemed kind of not nice.

2257
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,140
With the cat to the cats.

2258
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:08,080
I'm not really good with that kind of stuff.

2259
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:10,080
So, I forgot about this.

2260
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:14,520
Shut up.

2261
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:15,240
No.

2262
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:16,740
No, no.

2263
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:20,060
No.

2264
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:22,000
No, it's the butt.

2265
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:40,900
The moon shines bright to greet my strange new friend.

2266
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:46,300
As flames act for brethren, peddled beauties capture my
gaze.

2267
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:55,270
Oh, uh, uh, uh, Uh, camera.

2268
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:56,830
Camera.

2269
02:11:57,710 --> 02:11:59,190
He's so dreamy.

2270
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:01,190
What a gentleman.

2271
02:12:04,170 --> 02:12:05,010
My bones.

2272
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:06,430
Everybody, my bones.

2273
02:12:07,450 --> 02:12:08,750
He's gonna make me boneless.

2274
02:12:09,330 --> 02:12:09,730
No, no, no.

2275
02:12:11,070 --> 02:12:11,290
Ooh.

2276
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:16,720
Please, stand still.

2277
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:18,680
Why are his hands like that?

2278
02:12:23,730 --> 02:12:24,290
Sorry.

2279
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:27,310
Oh, will this go in the book of pictures?

2280
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:29,830
Aww, he's so cute!

2281
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:37,090
Oh, so...

2282
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:40,910
Once for vegetarian meals.

2283
02:12:41,710 --> 02:12:43,510
Oh, he's such a hopeless romantic.

2284
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:48,750
Aww, I would always sing verses by the fire for a rose.

2285
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:51,510
Can I get a large lamp?

2286
02:12:52,730 --> 02:12:56,050
Yeah, imagine if they were like, okay, um...

2287
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,650
I'm watching the time.

2288

2292
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:39,460
I heard this game was short, so I thought I would be able to
finish it in time.

2293
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:40,680
Mushroom slice.

2294
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:41,740
Oops.

2295
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:45,660
Oops.

2296
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:49,960
We've just been having so much fun.

2297
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,360
That's so cute.

2298
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:58,440
How did he say it?

2299
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:58,740
Four?

2300
02:13:59,020 --> 02:14:00,480
Four vegetarian meals?

2301
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:02,140
Does grilled cheese count?

2302
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:07,260
Can I jump this?

2303
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:08,710
Oh, he can't jump at all.

2304
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:17,640
It is such a joy to have this midnight snack.

2305
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:23,160
A lovely meal you've given me, my friend.

2306
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:23,620
Oh!

2307
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:25,940
I love moth.

2308
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:26,940
I love moth.

2309
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:27,920
I love moth.

2310
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:29,300
Alright.

2311
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:35,020
We could do a mushroom soup.

2312
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:35,980
Broth.

2313
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:39,000
Um, potato slice.

2314
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:41,160
I think we have potato slice?

2315
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:42,400
No, we have only bread.

2316
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:43,720
Toast!

2317
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:46,820
Win in doubt!

2318
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,060
Toast!

2319
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:55,480
You want four vegetarian meals?

2320
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,760
I got the toast for you, buddy.

2321
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:00,160
A toast!

2322
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:02,060
To our moth friend.

2323
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:05,940
Raise your glass.

2324
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:09,820
When she was gone, I feared this art was lost.

2325
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:15,360
A wondrous song of flavors ringing true.

2326
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,640
Oh, when she was gone...

2327
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:22,700
Oh no, I think she did die.

2328
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:26,580
PVAJ!

2329
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:29,740
Sorry, dog.

2330
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:31,220
One second, I'll pet you in a second.

2331
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:36,060
Peanut butter!

2332
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:38,420
A classic.

2333
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:42,280
And then it's...

2334
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:42,700
Oh, sugar.

2335
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:50,100
Oh, no.

2336
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,940
I mix you and strawberry.

2337
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:01,980
Peanut butter can contain rat hair.

2338
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:03,640
Might not be vegetarian.

2339
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:04,580
That's disgusting.

2340
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:05,540
Don't say that.

2341
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:06,820
Ew!

2342
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:09,560
Ew!

2343
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:18,600
Oh.

2344
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:20,380
It's swinging hard.

2345
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:33,580
the anxious mind back and forth back and forth when she was
gone i feel oh the spirit this art was lost how did you know

2346
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:50,060
she made that for me too this is so sad this is so sad
grilled cheese grilled cheese we're using all of my bread

2347
02:16:50,060 --> 02:16:52,640
slices It's perfect.

2348
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:55,520
Chase!

2349
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:09,920
I'll make it just like 100 different types of sandwich.

2350
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:13,700
Can we date him?

2351
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,040
Is this a dating sim?

2352
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:18,820
Grilled cheese.

2353
02:17:20,380 --> 02:17:22,260
Have I made the grilled cheese before?

2354
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:24,620
Maybe not.

2355
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:34,060
Behold, my greatest love, a tasty snack.

2356
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:35,660
He's so cute.

2357
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:41,100
Your kindness shows in all you've done for us.

2358
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:46,540
As wind rocks, the branches does flame cradle the soul.

2359
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:50,700
Crest half.

2360
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:54,700
Okay, so I need to figure out...

2361
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:56,760
First of all, I need to figure out where this goes.

2362
02:17:59,180 --> 02:18:02,500
to figure out this puzzle so I could open this.

2363
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:11,470
In the door.

2364
02:18:12,470 --> 02:18:13,070
Oh, you're right.

2365
02:18:13,530 --> 02:18:14,130
Oh, you're right.

2366
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:14,910
Thank you.

2367
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:21,240
I don't think it's this one.

2368
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:22,580
But, um...

2369
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:24,320
Oh, I think it may be these symbols.

2370
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,560
Okay, four.

2371
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:27,960
Uh.

2372
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:30,760
Jazz.

2373
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:32,800
Four.

2374
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:34,920
Null.

2375
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:39,280
Ponder of time can touch voices once spoken through this
device.

2376
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,700
Null.

2377
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:47,860
I like the music in here.

2378
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:50,580
Soul.

2379
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:55,480
Dog.

2380
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:01,680
The beads!

2381
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,040
Bean burrito!

2382
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:06,840
Who spilled the beans?

2383
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:16,940
I like the music and hear a lot Wait, I want the OST to this
game so bad Guys, I think I need help with this one

2384
02:19:20,910 --> 02:19:32,330
Went clockwise round the mountain Landed one pace Past due

02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:18,220
What do you guys think this one is?

2389
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:19,700
North's Flame.

2390
02:20:24,930 --> 02:20:25,510

Ten?

2393
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:38,010
Have you been graced by the giant of the stars?

2394
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:39,730
I don't think so.

2395
02:20:40,450 --> 02:20:44,790
At sunset with Baggins, where there was a way made for the
east.

2396
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:48,670
His goal was to be on fields of wildness.

2397
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:50,470
or evil beasts.

2398
02:21:08,170 --> 02:21:12,230
As time creeps forward, remember this moment is a constant.

2399
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:18,640
Good job, guys.

2400
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:19,400
We did it.

2401
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:26,520
Whoa!

2402
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:29,340
Oh my god, it really is Outer Wilds.

2403
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:29,920
Whoa!

2404
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:33,940
At last, you have made it.

2405
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:40,780
You have proven a worthy steward of our sacred home.

2406
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:42,680
Outer Wiles!

2407
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:49,240
We sense overflowing compassion as you stand in this grove.

2408
02:21:53,140 --> 02:21:57,260
The gathering of this chosen family awaits beyond the final
meal.

2409
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:03,380
Remember to take care.

2410
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:08,000
And make good memories.

2411
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:09,960
This

2412
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:29,600
one.

2413
02:22:30,180 --> 02:22:30,340
This one.

2414
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:36,420
Did- did- did- did- did- I'm trying to open it?

2415
02:22:36,620 --> 02:22:37,320
I'm trying to open it.

2416
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:41,340
That wasn't me how long!

2417
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:43,780
Serial!

2418
02:22:45,580 --> 02:22:47,520
Find all the ingredients.

2419
02:22:49,340 --> 02:22:51,400
Fortunate gems recipe.

2420
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:58,080
Are you here for your cereal?

2421
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:04,400
Oh, maybe the gems.

2422
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:07,740
Maybe he wants the gems.

2423
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:11,700
What are you doing here?

2424
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:13,100
Is this really an urn?

2425
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:13,900
Oh, no.

2426
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,460
Grandma is dead.

2427
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:19,540
Did we get all the recipes?

2428
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:23,440
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

2429
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:24,580
Yeah.

2430
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:29,780
3, 4, 5, 6.

2431
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:32,180
Oh, no, we didn't.

2432
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:32,960
We missed a couple.

2433
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:37,620
Where's the gems?

2434
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:39,640
I wasn't looking.

2435
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:40,200
I was only...

2436
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:43,720
I was only looking at the...

2437
02:23:45,140 --> 02:23:46,120
The numbers.

2438
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:51,360
Missing 22.

2439
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:53,400
Oh, fortunate gems!

2440
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:56,280
Serial milk, a bowl, and a spoon!

2441
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:00,980
That's why there was the...

2442
02:24:00,980 --> 02:24:02,160
I was wondering, because...

2443
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:03,700
Wait, a fork?

2444
02:24:04,820 --> 02:24:04,880
Oh.

2445
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:06,240
Oh, bowl.

2446
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:07,120
Okay, bowl and spoon.

2447
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:09,260
I was wondering why there were like a...

2448
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:10,360
Oh, my bad.

2449
02:24:11,460 --> 02:24:13,560
Why there was cutlery in there.

2450
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:15,240
Cereal?

2451
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:17,960
And milk.

2452
02:24:24,350 --> 02:24:26,330
Yeah, cereal in the oven, baby.

2453
02:24:27,170 --> 02:24:29,310
Coming right up for you, little buddy.

2454
02:24:33,330 --> 02:24:33,810
Fortunate...

2455
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:36,450
Oh my gosh, we got orange juice out of that somehow.

2456
02:24:36,810 --> 02:24:37,870
somewhere

2457
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:56,060
Yeah He loved it I'm coming I'm following

2458
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:09,760
What's happening?

2459
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:22,500
It really is outer wilds!

2460
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:33,460
Pants!

2461
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:35,680
We'll keep it.

2462
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:37,420
It's cute.

2463
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:40,940
We got seeds.

2464
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:41,600
What's this?

2465
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:47,500
My dear, as I put ink to thods, memories of bygone summer
nights flow.

2466
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:52,680
Cricket songs touched by the scent of charcoal and pine,
preserved over a lifetime.

2467
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:55,540
The verses for all who reside in this space.

2468
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:57,760
I feel like I should have saved this game for summer.

2469
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:58,740
It's so sweet.

2470
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:05,960
When these words are found, the little ones have made a new
friend and you a new family.

2471
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:07,020
We will meet again.

2472
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:09,160
May a lifetime of songs fill you.

2473
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:10,860
Love XX.

2474
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:13,020
Oh!

2475
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:15,220
My friends!

2476
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:24,960
Who the heck is you?

2477
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:26,560
Wait, I think that's the demon.

2478
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:30,500
All the different vibes are so cute!

2479
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:34,770
Solid snake even showed up!

2480
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:37,740
Goober!

2481
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,380
Can I pet my dog?

2482
02:26:47,390 --> 02:26:48,020
Wow!

2483
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:50,640
Everyone's here!

2484
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:52,460
Solid chicken!

2485
02:27:08,450 --> 02:27:11,270
This is so sweet!

2486
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:16,950
Join

2487
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:24,600

2488
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,240
Backyard Bonanza!

2489
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:33,390
That was so cute!

2490
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:40,140
That was so cute!

2491
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:43,120
Voice actors?

2492
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:45,100
It does.

2493
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:47,020
Should I have a voice actor?

2494
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:50,040
That was so stinking cute.

2495
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:53,360
Felt like a mini...

2496
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:57,100
A mini, like, uh...

2497
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:58,660
Outer Wild successor.

2498
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:01,240
Wow!

2499
02:28:01,820 --> 02:28:02,580
I hop!

2500
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:07,100
That was so cute.

2501
02:28:07,940 --> 02:28:09,100
That was so cute.

2502
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:09,880
The creatures!

2503
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:14,960
Thank you for playing!

2504
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:26,160
Yeah, spiritual successors somehow.

2505
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:27,880
Yeah, I was just so cute.

2506
02:28:29,740 --> 02:28:32,940
Oh, all of our recipes and stuff are like our ingredients.

2507
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:35,620
Wait, I want to resume the game right quick.

2508
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:37,820
Oh, wait, this is so cute.

2509
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:40,480
Cute little game that made me very hungry.

2510
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:42,820
I'll grab some dinner while watching you on Nimi's stream.

2511
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:43,640
Yeah!

2512
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:45,680
We don't have so much time.

2513
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:47,140
I just want to look at this real quick.

2514
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:50,900
This one we didn't get.

2515
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:56,360
The evening's ever-watching eye.

2516
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:03,920
And this one maybe is the eye boo that shows up.

2517
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:04,680
Let me see.

2518
02:29:09,820 --> 02:29:10,500
Friend!

2519
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:15,080
Keep that.

2520
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:17,360
Alright, let me let you win.

2521
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:23,120
Once to find kindred spirits.

2522
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:25,800
Oh sweet!

2523
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:29,420
Oh my god!

2524
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:35,000
I want to see if I can get like photos of these, you know?

2525
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:35,640
Oops.

2526
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:40,160
Where did I throw the camera at?

2527
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:41,380
Wait.

2528
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:43,220
Where did I throw my camera at?

2529
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:44,900
I'll just do the lost and found.

2530
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:46,580
Oh, just kidding.

2531
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:48,280
Oh, there it is.

2532
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:49,640
Okay.

2533
02:29:56,300 --> 02:29:56,760
Oh.

2534
02:30:05,690 --> 02:30:08,290
Giant deer thing.

2535
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:11,150
Welcome back to our grove.

2536
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:17,630
While our time is shared, may we find peace in meditation.

2537
02:30:19,630 --> 02:30:21,190
Zipperink, feel better!

2538
02:30:21,970 --> 02:30:22,670
Feel better.

2539
02:30:23,130 --> 02:30:24,470
This was so sweet.

2540
02:30:25,270 --> 02:30:26,190
Thank you.

2541
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:29,830
This was so stinking sweet.

2542
02:30:32,390 --> 02:30:44,250
In a reality form, of questions my strange little friend's
kindness is not one so we have once to see the forest at

2543
02:30:44,250 --> 02:30:51,150
peace we are graced by its presence a true honor to be part
of its gaze this is the most accurate depiction i could come

02:30:51,150 --> 02:30:58,990
up from memory it's pretty good actually i admit i was kind
of grumpy from work but my heart is fully melted i feel so

2545
02:30:58,990 --> 02:31:04,330

2547
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:09,050
Thorego, thank you so much for the peek!

2548
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:11,690
Did Mothman take your bones?

2549
02:31:12,090 --> 02:31:12,610
Are you okay?

2550
02:31:13,050 --> 02:31:13,630
Because you're a ghost.

2551
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:14,590
Excited for the concert?

2552
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:15,390
Me too!

2553
02:31:16,310 --> 02:31:18,610
I don't remember my mother's face.

2554
02:31:20,990 --> 02:31:25,710
I want to try and get these right before we go though.

2555
02:31:29,010 --> 02:31:30,670
The evening's ever watching eye.

2556
02:31:30,730 --> 02:31:31,390
So the moon?

2557
02:31:32,110 --> 02:31:33,970
And then this one is like a bush.

2558
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:39,550
By offense, this guy...

2559
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:43,180
No?

2560
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:48,020
Oh my gosh, you're scared of me.

2561
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:50,520
This one?

2562
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:55,320
The fireflies?

2563
02:31:55,580 --> 02:31:56,100
Oh, maybe.

2564
02:31:56,300 --> 02:31:56,720
Let's see.

2565
02:31:57,220 --> 02:31:57,760
Oh, yeah.

2566
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:00,560
Oh, firefly!

2567
02:32:02,800 --> 02:32:05,540
Now I think about it, this game was so... Courage the
Cowardly Dog.

2568
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:06,800
Nice... It is!

2569
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:08,340
That's a good way to describe it.

2570
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:10,440
That is a good way.

2571
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:11,400
And then the moon.

2572
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:15,300
The moon!

2573
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:20,040
Fill out the photo album.

2574
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:24,940
You can watch their dances.

2575
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:25,800
Oh, once nothing?

2576
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:26,540
On a diet?

2577
02:32:26,780 --> 02:32:28,560
You don't see these guys around much anymore.

2578
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,300
Like a lot of moisture.

2579
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:34,340
Once nothing?

2580
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:35,000
Can't eat?

2581
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:36,520
Oh, it says moon here.

2582
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:50,480
the bunny did I get all the achievements let me check oh I
did not oh I guess there's like who needs a cookbook anyway

2583
02:32:50,480 --> 02:33:00,400
I guess if you make a bad meal basic safety why would you do
that obtain 100 pieces of slop there's an achievement for

2584
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:09,120
getting slop hold back the darkness of the night afraid of
the dark and master chief Make every...

2585
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:11,500
Not chief, not chief, master chef!

2586
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:15,380
Master chef, make every meal!

2587
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,120
And then there's one hidden achievement.

2588
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:19,820
I wonder what that could be.

2589
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:22,580
Master chief!

2590
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:33,200
You guys would make the same mistake, I feel.

2591
02:33:41,930 --> 02:33:42,810
The OST.

2592
02:33:44,770 --> 02:33:46,450
Devs, if you're watching, please.

2593
02:33:47,250 --> 02:33:48,370
Release the soundtrack.

2594
02:33:49,030 --> 02:33:49,890
It's too good.

2595
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,400
I was clicking on this earlier.

2596
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:02,380
How many more do I have?

2597
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:07,060
Did I get it?

2598
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:10,980
Wait, I'm at 30 out of 100 still.

2599
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:13,880
Okay, I'll give up.

2600
02:34:14,480 --> 02:34:16,080
Cortana set over to bake.

2601
02:34:18,860 --> 02:34:21,000
This was such a cute game.

2602
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:23,800
Our note is going to be...

2603
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:25,340
Oh hey, it's different now.

2604
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:29,440
I know what it says.

2605
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:30,920
Oh.

2606
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:32,360
It says.

2607
02:34:42,260 --> 02:34:43,060
Dreams.

2608
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:47,880
Sweet dreams are made of these.

2609
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:51,520
I have to disagree.

2610
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:53,900
We're nerds!

2611
02:34:54,340 --> 02:34:55,320
Wait, no way.

2612
02:34:55,720 --> 02:34:58,400
There's no way that we would get node and then nerd.

2613
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:05,200
Did you just say nerds?

2614
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:10,060
Nerdies?

2615
02:35:22,710 --> 02:35:25,340
100% Aminto game.

2616
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:28,080
I feel so.

2617
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:29,500
This was so cute.

2618
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:31,680

2619
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:33,320
Right pants.

02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:35,340
Yeah, waiting for your cereal.

2621
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:39,160

This was so cozy and cute and awesome!

2637
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:18,460
I'm really glad we could...

2638
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:20,720
I'm really glad we could play it, so...

2639
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:23,060
The raccoon's on the rocking chair again.

2640
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,560
Oh, I must have just missed him.

2641
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:27,140
What's wrong with me?

2642
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:32,440
I wish I could sit in the rocking chair.

2643
02:36:44,100 --> 02:36:45,080
You guys see that, right?

2644
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:56,680
What was that?

2645
02:36:59,240 --> 02:36:59,540
Whoa!

2646
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:05,960
Cool.

2647
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:13,080
Cool, he was on the top of the fridge!

2648
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:20,880
Osamito, everybody!

2649
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:24,500
