1
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,840
It's so loud.

2
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:25,080
Welcome to Spooky's Chopscare Mansion.

3
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,080
Welcome.

4
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,500
Ah, ghost.

5
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,320
I think I will be the spookiest thing here.

6
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,420
I think.

7
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,140
Why am I so small?

8
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,220
Is that better?

9
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,740
I hope you guys enjoy the game.

10
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,660
With my face covering the whole thing.

11
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,300
Much better.

12
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,960
Bigger?

13
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,680
I

14
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
am the game.

15
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,080
I am the game.

16
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Bigger?

17
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,960
I think it's as big as I can get.

18
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,150
Anyway.

19
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,650
Anyway.

20
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,430
Anyway.

21
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,670
Welcome.

22
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,650
I've never played this game before.

23
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,310
I'm ready to get jumped out of my pantaloons.

24
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,910
I'm ready.

25
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,390
Stop staring at me with them big ol' eyes.

26
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,630
Smaller.

27
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,570
Once you go big, there ain't going back.

28
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,870
Go big or go home, baby.

29
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,950
Played the original before.

30
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,070
I've never played the original.

31
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,730
I've never played the new one.

32
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,350
I've seen sometimes people playing this game.

33
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,070
So I truly know like nothing about it.

34
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,990
Actually, truly, truly nothing.

35
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,110
Nothing.

36
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,750
Headphone users turn the volume down.

37
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:34,930
Oh.

38
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,630
Actually, thank you for reminding me.

39
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,670
Because I do want to turn my volume down.

40
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,010
I turned it down a little bit before.

41
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,990
This is nice.

42
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,050
I love how you can turn the jump scares off.

43
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,710
Isn't this a jump scare mansion?

44
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,670
Wait, this is kind of nice.

45
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,450
This is chill.

46
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,410
I like that you can turn off the head bob.

47
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,470
Oh yeah, let's turn that off.

48
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,630
What, should I keep motion blur on or off?

49
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,850
I can't remember what people like more.

50
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,170
Calm before the scare.

51
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,570
Off?

52
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:22,990
Okay.

53
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,710
That should be good then.

54
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,710
The hell is in the bottom right corner?

55
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,830
What are you...

56
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,990
The scariest thing you'll see all day?

57
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,210
Your nightmare?

58
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,970
Your parasocial demon?

59
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,070
Wait, what is it called?

60
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,890
No, wait, what's that word?

61
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,710
The night demon, the ones that make you not able to move.

62
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,810
What is that called?

63
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,310
What is that?

64
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,150
The paralysis demon?

65
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,130
Oh,

66
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,390
it's the sleep paralysis.

67
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,410
Oh, my god.

68
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,350
Good morning, morning, Minto.

69
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,510
It's my birthday today.

70
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,070
Can I get a spoopy Happy Bob song?

71
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:21,830
Of course.

72
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,790
Wait, how do I say your name?

73
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,030
Ganymede?

74
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,430
Happy birthday to you.

75
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,170
Happy birthday to you.

76
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,990
I hope I said your name right.

77
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,450
If I didn't, I'm so sorry.

78
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,110
But it's your birthday, so it doesn't matter!

79
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,990
Happy birthday to you!

80
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,330
Parallelogram demon.

81
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,750
But yeah, I'm not scared at all.

82
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,530
I miss the old music.

83
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,570
This one makes me want to act up a little bit.

84
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,300
What if this was my house, you know?

85
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,020
Parasocial demon.

86
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,020
She's got such a way with words.

87
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,420
You mean you aren't already?

88
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,180
I'm not even at half my power.

89
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,990
I got something in my eye.

90
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,550
Hold on.

91
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,830
Spooky parenthesis demon.

92
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,110
Are we ready to start the game?

93
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,750
Are you guys ready to get your socks knocked off?

94
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,870
You guys are going to scream so much!

95
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,470
Oh wait, which one do I do?

96
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,470
Karamari Hospital?

97
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,190
Should I just do the regular one?

98
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,450
Renovated version of the original jumpscare mansion?

99
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,150
It's not my socks.

100
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,830
Last thing you see.

101
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,970
Before the end is mint.

102
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,030
Prove me wrong.

103
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,710
And check out six of the twenty!

104
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,330
Can you hold my hand?

105
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,450
Okay.

106
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,050
The mansion?

107
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:21,770
Mansion?

108
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,270
Okay!

109
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,030
Renovated version of the original jumpscare mansion.

110
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,720
Wow!

111
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,300
This...

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,300
This mansion is not big enough for the two of us.

113
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,780
There's something up there.

114
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,640
Make it through 1,000 rooms.

115
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,280
You'd like to realize that the end...

116
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
of this fairy tale...

117
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,520
has already been ended.

118
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,540
Is that how it goes?

119
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,490
Anyway, just go.

120
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,070
Oh!

121
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,990
There she goes!

122
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,810
I can do that too!

123
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,070
Watch, watch, watch.

124
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,230
I can do this.

125
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,990
Oh!

126
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:03,690
Oh!

127
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:03,810
Um...

128
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,870
Oh, it pauses me.

129
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:10,870
Never mind.

130
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,130
So, 1,000 rooms, eh?

131
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,480
Can you do it?

132
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,340
I could if I wanted to, but I don't feel like it right now.

133
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,020
Alright, left or right everybody?

134
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,200
Is that Marceline's sister?

135
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,960
My parasocial demon ghost.

136
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,160
Stop!

137
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,160
Left?

138
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,560
Okay.

139
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,030
That was a test for you guys.

140
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,530
Did you guys jump at my scream?

141
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
Left or right?

142
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
Well, we went left last time.

143
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,710
Okay.

144
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,290
I think I have a stamina.

145
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,390
Maybe.

146
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,830
Wow.

147
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,670
So lovely.

148
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,390
Room 5, we're already killing it with time.

149
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,830
Oh, I think the...

150
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,150
Okay, I do have stamina.

151
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,690
Okay, that's good to know.

152
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,750
Oh!

153
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,490
What's here?

154
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,890
We can take a little break.

155
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,410
I call the bunk bed...

156
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,390
Oh, there's something over here too.

157
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,910
I ain't afraid of no toast.

158
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,130
I don't think I can interact with these.

159
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,090
I have a bunk bed IRL.

160
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:41,690
What?

161
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,310
What was that?

162
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,360
Wow, the atmosphere is lovely here.

163
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,140
I'm gonna go to this room.

164
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,000
I call top bunk.

165
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,760
Too late, slowpoke.

166
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,000
I've already called every bunk in the bed.

167
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,400
Wait, why is my...

168
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,000
Why am I doing that?

169
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,060
These Minecraft-looking beds.

170
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,420
Minecraft-looking air bed.

171
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,520
Wow, this place is huge.

172
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,420
Actually, you know what?

173
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,100
I'm kind of glad I'm not a maid for this place.

174
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,940
I would have to clean every single area here.

175
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,340
Can you imagine...

176
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,400
What was that?

177
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,620
Can you imagine?

178
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,960
I would be scrubbing every single little stone.

179
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,920
I would be scrubbing every single little stone.

180
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,860
Oh!

181
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,920
Uh oh.

182
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,660
No!

183
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,560
PNG bones!

184
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,920
The skinny legend died here!

185
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,660
No!

186
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,200
Rip, rip skinny legend.

187
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,480
Rip, rip skinny legend.

188
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,200
So far, this has been a breeze.

189
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,280
Spooky scary skeletons and shivers up your spine.

190
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,740
Oh my god, there's more!

191
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,740
Yeah, I could use his bones to cause the fire.

192
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,560
Strike a fire, I mean.

193
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,360
We're not causing a fire.

194
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,700
The stamina goes down real fast.

195
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,580
Oh!

196
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,360
What interesting decor.

197
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,540
Oh, there's more bones!

198
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,600
It's a mirror.

199
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
I'm looking mighty fine today.

200
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,320
Little wispy, you know?

201
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,160
Oh!

202
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,260
More bones!

203
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,400
What's that sound?

204
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,580
Is that you?

205
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,760
I think I'm going to keep going.

206
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,160
I think I'm going to keep going.

207
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,360
Ah!

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,440
What's that?

209
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,640
Why does it sound so rumbly?

210
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,860
Look at that head.

211
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,400
So cute.

212
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,180
Why is it...

213
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,240
Oh.

214
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,520
At first this place seemed cute.

215
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,180
But I've been here for a few days now and I feel quite parched.

216
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,400
And I'm getting this feeling like I'm being watched or something.

217
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,140
This is not romantic at all!

218
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,820
What's that sound?

219
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,040
Wait, didn't I come from here?

220
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,520
Did I go the wrong way?

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,340
No.

222
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,200
Room 23.

223
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,230
So there's notes.

224
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,590
Okay.

225
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,750
Good to know.

226
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,190
Wait, the more I go...

227
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,590
Okay, that sound is disappearing.

228
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,230
Is something...

229
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,350
Is something chasing me?

230
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,170
Not so romantic.

231
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,150
Uh oh.

232
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,850
It's loud again.

233
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,530
Uh oh.

234
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,850
Is it the paintings?

235
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,190
It's me?

236
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,310
Oh my god.

237
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,250
I was gonna say the guy in the picture is gone.

238
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,210
Let's go to the right.

239
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,110
It's my tummy.

240
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:28,850
Um...

241
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,530
What are you talking about?

242
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:30,930
I ate.

243
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,660
I'm not going to go towards the sound.

244
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,820
I'm going to go in here.

245
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,720
Oh, locked.

246
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,800
Just kidding.

247
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,320
I have to go towards the sound.

248
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,260
P&G bones or lost cookie.

249
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,380
Click or save.

250
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,740
I'll be honest...

251
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,300
Oh, there's a note.

252
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,960
I know something...

253
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,700
I know something is following me, but I feel like I'm prancing through the same rooms over and over.

254
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,720
That's what I just said!

255
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,420
Hopefully, leaving notes as breadcrumbs will prove I'm making progress and reaching some destination.

256
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,120
I just hope I don't run out of ink.

257
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
I am dreadfully thirsty.

258
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,920
He's going to start using his blood!

259
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,280
Wait!

260
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,080
He's just like me!

261
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,120
I said that same thing!

262
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,580
I said I think I'm going through this...

263
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,860
Did I go through this room before?

264
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm already going crazy!

265
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,020
Get used to that.

266
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,440
Already through room 34.

267
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,660
What is that sound?

268
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,620
I've learned that blood for the blood god.

269
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,900
It's from Warhammer.

270
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,740
Ink.

271
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
Not quite quenching my thirst.

272
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,100
Taste is terrible.

273
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,800
Stains are terrible.

274
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,980
I don't think drinking...

275
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,320
It was a very romance...

276
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,480
Why is everything about the romance?

277
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,010
Is this supposed to be like a honeymoon suite?

278
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:50,890
Or...

279
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,910
Am I supposed to be...

280
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,430
Am I...

281
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,470
Are they chasing me here because I booked the room by myself?

282
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,150
I'm supposed to be with someone lovely?

283
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,850
Or...

284
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,570
This area looks familiar too.

285
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,670
Oh, we can go in.

286
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,030
Oh.

287
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,410
Maybe I should run.

288
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,890
Adventurous romance.

289
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,210
Oh, hey!

290
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:12,670
Hey!

291
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,590
Don't lock me out!

292
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,770
Oh.

293
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,610
We saw this one before.

294
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,430
And this one before.

295
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:21,910
Oh.

296
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,250
That's a little spooky.

297
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,530
I don't really like that one.

298
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,290
What was that noise?

299
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,130
They're still there.

300
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:30,570
Hmm.

301
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,190
Learn how to sprint?

302
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:34,610
I know!

303
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,390
Wait.

304
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,570
Is this different from sprinting?

305
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,290
Is running different?

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,820
I found something today to satisfy my unromantic thirst.

307
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,280
I awoke today from a brief faint and found before me a bottle of red wine.

308
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,100
I'm not sure what brand or year.

309
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,420
For there is no label.

310
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,340
All I gather is that it tastes strongly...

311
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,060
Metallic.

312
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Metallic.

313
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,440
Metallic.

314
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,960
Metallic.

315
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,100
Oh, buddy.

316
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,380
I don't think that was wine.

317
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,770
I think you just got a good case of iron.

318
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,100
As long as he thinks it's wine, that's fine.

319
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,340
Right?

320
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,060
But also, wouldn't it, like, taste so horribly?

321
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,380
OK.

322
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,180
We're almost to 50.

323
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,780
Can I go in these now?

324
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,520
Oh!

325
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,900
Oh!

326
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,540
I hit a save!

327
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,020
Oh!

328
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,580
You can do it.

329
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,600
We can help.

330
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,860
Papa John's.

331
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,220
That's different from the Papa I know.

332
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,320
Where is my lovely romantic evening?

333
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,860
Down?

334
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,220
Wait, what do you mean by that?

335
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,100
What

336
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,710
is happening?

337
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,630
Master!

338
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,730
Master!

339
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,170
Miss!

340
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,220
The whole room is an elevator.

341
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,740
Oh no!

342
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,130
She's going down, down and she's rolling around.

343
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,290
I don't think that was wine.

344
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,510
I told you bro!

345
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,210
I warned you about the wine bro!

346
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,290
Bro!

347
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,120
This looks familiar too, this room.

348
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,140
It keeps happening.

349
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,760
You are here.

350
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,430
The rooms are spinning and moving.

351
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,350
I'm getting my cardio in.

352
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,950
Didn't expect a little guy like that though.

353
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,370
Oh!

354
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,190
I'm gonna avoid that.

355
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,290
Spouting, splashing, soaking, innards and just invoking.

356
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,090
Nailing never stops the choking.

357
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,650
Oh!

358
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,370
Oh god!

359
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,490
Oh god!

360
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,230
Wait!

361
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,850
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

362
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,850
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

363
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,900
Oh god!

364
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,790
I don't even touch it though!

365
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,470
This is messed up!

366
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,250
Oh god!

367
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,710
Oh god!

368
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,450
I picked the wrong room!

369
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,170
I picked the wrong room!

370
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,350
I picked the wrong room!

371
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,150
I picked the wrong room!

372
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,650
Why am I so slow in the beginning?

373
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,330
No!

374
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:06,550
No!

375
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:06,750
No!

376
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,210
Oh god!

377
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,450
Oh god!

378
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:07,630
Oh god!

379
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,510
They're still coming.

380
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,610
I picked the wrong room!

381
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,730
Don't look back, okay?

382
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,150
Oh!

383
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:24,970
Oh shoot!

384
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:25,890
Oh my god!

385
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,390
Oh my god!

386
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:26,710
Oh my god!

387
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:26,990
Oh my god!

388
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,030
Oh my god!

389
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm gonna die here!

390
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:29,930
I'm gonna die here!

391
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,590
Don't come at me!

392
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,370
This way!

393
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,430
Don't be locked!

394
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,070
They don't stop coming and they don't stop...

395
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,770
I have a question.

396
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,910
Is this all randomly generated or is there like kind of a...

397
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,990
A pumpkin!

398
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,770
Is there kind of a rhyme or reason?

399
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,710
Am I good now?

400
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,210
Yes.

401
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,710
Do what?

402
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,490
Are they still coming?

403
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,050
Maybe not.

404
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:09,990
It's random.

405
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,510
Sort of random but not really.

406
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,450
So many bones.

407
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,630
It's a roguelike.

408
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,650
Oh that's so fun!

409
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,910
No notes though.

410
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,930
Every X levels has certain theme floors.

411
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,510
Okay.

412
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,850
Very cool.

413
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,470
Nothing here.

414
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,790
Nothing here.

415
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,780
Can you fight?

416
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,480
I don't think so.

417
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,700
Oh!

418
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,040
This is fun!

419
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Let's go this way.

420
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,000
This is actually kind of romantic.

421
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,300
I don't know what he's talking about.

422
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,140
I feel.

423
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,360
I needed a fun stream today.

424
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,320
Good morning.

425
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,020
Good morning!

426
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,860
He's still in the same spot.

427
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,160
We have a new guy!

428
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,940
Look at him.

429
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,260
Boingo.

430
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,940
Let's keep going.

431
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,080
Are they still locked?

432
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,320
Oh!

433
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:26,990
Fancy.

434
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,330
Toy horse or banana?

435
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,790
It looked like a banana like he was eating.

436
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,010
But a big old banana to me.

437
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,510
Yeah I think this is actually quite romantic.

438
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,650
Nothing else I would want...

439
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,130
Oh shoot.

440
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,810
No please.

441
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,830
No no.

442
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,110
No no.

443
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,510
I changed my mind!

444
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,790
This is everybody's fault!

445
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,570
This is not romantic at all!

446
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:53,550
No!

447
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,250
Oh my God.

448
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,910
What is this?

449
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,730
Oh my God.

450
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,770
Oh I didn't go the wrong way!

451
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,250
Ah!

452
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:04,830
No!

453
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,590
This isn't romantic!

454
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,890
Wait did I go the wrong way?

455
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,830
Please tell me no.

456
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,970
I didn't go the wrong way!

457
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,910
I went the right way!

458
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,380
Please.

459
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,140
Please.

460
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,060
Let me through.

461
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:22,980
Please.

462
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,260
Please.

463
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,520
Please.

464
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,280
Leave me alone!

465
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,300
Why are you guys so obsessed with me?

466
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,340
Ah!

467
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,240
Oh my God.

468
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,580
This...

469
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,520
These goo pile.

470
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:39,940
I swear.

471
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,440
Run run run.

472
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,300
Run run.

473
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,540
Ah!

474
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,040
That one looked like me.

475
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,120
Um.

476
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,720
I will take my royalties now.

477
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,080
Oh.

478
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,380
Oh my God.

479
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,540
Legally distinct Minto.

480
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,880
Oh.

481
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,920
Oh.

482
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,390
Nicolas Cage.

483
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,110
Better ingredients, better pizza... oh pasta.

484
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,410
Sorry.

485
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,430
I think my cat sees a bird.

486
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,410
Her tail's going a little crazy.

487
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,610
Better ingredients, better pasta.

488
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,150
That's the power of the Home Depot.

489
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,050
Whew!

490
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:29,550
Oh.

491
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,390
Oh.

492
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,170
They're in your head.

493
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,190
They truly...

494
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,190
I just said it instinctually.

495
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,030
Keep a little pep in your step.

496
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,090
Oh, this place is cute.

497
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,870
I have always found the Windows 95 3D maze screensaver romantic.

498
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:47,950
Yes!

499
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,490
Yes!

500
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,610
You the real MVP.

501
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,310
I can't believe I did that in first try.

502
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,690
I can't believe I figured out... or rather I went the right ways and I didn't even know it.

503
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,390
Best worst way to spend my birthday.

504
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,930
What?

505
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,310
No!

506
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,430
Fake smiley!

507
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,710
What do you mean the best worst way?

508
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,170
What do you mean?

509
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,890
Happy birthday to you.

510
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,110
Happy birthday to you.

511
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,910
Happy birthday dear smiley.

512
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,090
Happy birthday to you.

513
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,370
Happy birthday.

514
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,890
Okay, let's go.

515
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,010
I feel like I could be a little jump scare in this.

516
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,350
ViviCore, thanks for the 10 gifted.

517
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,010
What's this say?

518
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,830
I don't know how much longer I could go on.

519
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,730
I haven't seen any of my previous notes.

520
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,050
So that means either I'm getting somewhere or someone is taking them.

521
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,070
What kind of monster will we approach?

522
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,490
Will we...

523
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,070
Will we...

524
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,410
Will we...

525
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:04,990
See this time?

526
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,290
I feel like I'm in Indiana Jones.

527
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
I like this.

528
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,860
Oh, what's that?

529
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,320
What's wrong?

530
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,300
What's happening?

531
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,570
But there's a note here.

532
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,510
That was such a surprise that there would be another entry.

533
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,310
Another actual entry.

534
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,310
One I could admire.

535
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,890
Then suddenly as I came it left and now you disband.

536
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,750
Your influence and inspiration will never leave me.

537
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,950
What is it?

538
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,690
Oh, okay.

539
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,030
Well, I actually can't go through any of these.

540
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,710
Maybe.

541
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,280
Is it gone?

542
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,880
No!

543
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,480
Huh?

544
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,120
Huh?

545
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,340
No...

546
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,300
No!

547
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,160
No.

548
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,580
Uh...

549
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,060
No!

550
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,560
Uh?

551
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,660
No.

552
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,120
Uh?

553
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,700
Uh?

554
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:23,900
Nrgh!

555
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,140
Ah...

556
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,620
A...

557
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,020
EMPT!

558
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,020
No!

559
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,300
Do I go back?

560
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,880
No.

561
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,280
Read no.

562
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,080
Open door?

563
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,880
Okay, okay.

564
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,640
There's puzzles like...

565
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,700
Interesting.

566
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,040
Okay.

567
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,840
Oh, shoot.

568
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,660
Can I fall off?

569
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,720
You know what?

570
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,460
Maybe I shouldn't try.

571
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,940
But why would they give me the option to fall off if I couldn't fall, you know?

572
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,220
The mint never falls off.

573
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,380
I don't think I can.

574
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,480
No, I don't think I can.

575
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,540
That's good to know then.

576
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,200
This one's really long.

577
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,740
They even have paintings down here.

578
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,340
This one is really romantic.

579
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,800
With the sexy cages.

580
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,940
The mood lighting.

581
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,520
Oh, and the goop.

582
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,420
The most romantic of it all.

583
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,360
Probably.

584
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,860
Let's go straight.

585
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,460
More goop?

586
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,560
This is where my lovely slime girlfriend lives.

587
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,180
You know?

588
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,940
Aw, he's still chillin' there.

589
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
He's like in the same spot.

590
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,680
Aww.

591
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,760
How does the goop taste?

592
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,980
Probably like a line.

593
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,540
What is that?

594
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,280
Hal?

595
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,980
Anyway...

596
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
Oh!

597
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,380
First up... oh!

598
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,060
Mary, finally!

599
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,620
Third is Bram.

600
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,280
And he is stoked to be here.

601
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,200
Mrs. Spook!

602
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,640
Everyone's been waiting for Mito!

603
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,000
I feel like Goop would love Gwyneth Paltrow.

604
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,260
Who's that?

605
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,580
What's this one?

606
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,460
Mall of the Spook!

607
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,060
Spooky car!

608
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
Oh, it's out of order.

609
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,760
Which one do you guys want to play?

610
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,600
No?

611
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,880
No to the games?

612
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,720
Oh.

613
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm already playing.

614
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,220
Meow!

615
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,160
Meow!

616
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,560
Meow!

617
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,900
No one's gonna slow me down, baby!

618
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,040
There's no jump scares in this game, are there?

619
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,100
Wow!

620
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,920
Drift!

621
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,580
Why are the cars not on the road?

622
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,720
Why are the cars...

623
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,100
Oh gosh, I feel like I'm gonna play...

624
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,740
You know that commercial of the car?

625
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,100
And then... Oh!

626
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,460
I just killed a person, I think.

627
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,060
Oh!

628
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,680
I just...

629
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,020
Sorry.

630
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,500
Um... Oh, I have to kill them!

631
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:20,980
Oh!

632
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,740
Oh, oops.

633
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,480
I thought I was just driving.

634
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,680
Oh, I took out a tree!

635
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,880
Vehicular manslaughter!

636
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,040
Oh yeah!

637
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,120
Wait!

638
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,280
Oh, they're still spinning.

639
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,290
Four!

640
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,510
Five!

641
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:54,970
Five!

642
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,330
There they go.

643
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:00,830
Hey!

644
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,230
You're not allowed to be here.

645
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,210
There we go!

646
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:06,650
Oh!

647
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,230
We'll come back to him.

648
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,010
I think.

649
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,490
Oh my gosh, I gotta kill them all first.

650
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,050
Meow!

651
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,010
But you know that commercial of the car?

652
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,390
Like driving and then it has the pop-up zombie and it like...

653
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,270
Got everybody as a kid.

654
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,370
Oh, I've hit that tree before once.

655
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,570
Hey, where did all these cars come from?

656
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,350
Hahaha!

657
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,390
Yeah!

658
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,040
The ancient jump scare.

659
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,460
I know!

660
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,880
That's what...

661
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,100
I feel like...

662
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,300
Is gonna happen here.

663
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,340
Wait, this is only stage one.

664
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,820
I wasted so much time thinking that I was just supposed to drive around.

665
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,640
Oh, here's a guy.

666
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,410
Oh!

667
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,170
I wasn't looking at the road!

668
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,370
I took out two trees!

669
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,110
Where's the rest of the cars?

670
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:12,770
Hello?

671
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:17,680
Hello?

672
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,540
Yeah, deforestation, everybody.

673
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:20,960
Oh!

674
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,520
There's a guy.

675
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,440
Two guys!

676
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,330
You killed them all.

677
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,210
No, there's three left!

678
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,290
This is so fun.

679
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:36,810
Oh!

680
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,510
Yeah!

681
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,810
Oh, one guy, one guy, one guy.

682
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,290
Get one guy, get one guy, get one guy, get one guy.

683
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,210
Get one guy, get one guy, get one guy.

684
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,660
Crying doesn't pay?

685
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,420
Is that what she says?

686
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,040
Hahaha!

687
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,920
Is there a special for taking out the trees too?

688
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,280
No really, where is he?

689
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,740
I'll take out the trees while I'm waiting.

690
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,080
Get the one guy.

691
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,460
I'm looking for him!

692
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
He's a trickster!

693
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,460
Where is he?

694
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,720
Can you imagine if you missed?

695
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,160
That would be so... Oh!

696
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,820
Yeah!

697
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah!

698
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,690
Oh, how do I get out?

699
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,070
There we go.

700
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,670
That was good fun!

701
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,750
Wait, I kind of want to play all of them now.

702
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,070
Oh!

703
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:49,970
Oh my god!

704
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,090
Oh my god!

705
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,030
This is...

706
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

707
00:35:59,410 --> 00:35:59,950
Oh, okay.

708
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,730
I do have to press.

709
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,750
Oh, ow!

710
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,630
What's the point of this one?

711
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:08,690
Oh!

712
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,590
Kind of a bot though.

713
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,090
I should just have my auto...

714
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:15,470
Oh my god!

715
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,630
The flashing is kind of killing me though.

716
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,310
Oh my god!

717
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,390
Why is it flashing so much?

718
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,190
Oh!

719
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,290
It's flashing a lot!

720
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,730
I don't like this one though.

721
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,070
This one flashes too much.

722
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:31,890
Who am I?

723
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,550
Am I spooky?

724
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,640
What am I?

725
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,940
Am I collecting these?

726
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,500
Or...

727
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,140
What am I doing?

728
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,740
I'm not even eating them.

729
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,920
Nothing's happening.

730
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,840
Oh, there he is!

731
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,700
He's eating them!

732
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,420
Ah!

733
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,460
Spooky Inception.

734
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,280
Metagamer.

735
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,060
I don't know.

736
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
Introducing some ghosts!

737
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,720
First up is Minta!

738
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,740
Yeah!

739
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,980
Like an inverse Pac-Man.

740
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,780
Yeah, I was...

741
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,460
Oops, my bad.

742
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,340
There we go.

743
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,760
Yeah, I was spooky.

744
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,340
That was a fun little break.

745
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:19,960
Yeah!

746
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,200
Back into the spooky mansion!

747
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,760
Oh!

748
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,120
Whoa!

749
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,320
Whoa!

750
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,180
What the hell is this?

751
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,080
What the hell is this?

752
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,280
Oh my god!

753
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,200
Raptor head!

754
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,480
Meat man.

755
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,920
Uh oh.

756
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,180
That's not good.

757
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,940
Uh oh.

758
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,720
I think this means something bad.

759
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,980
What's here?

760
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,400
Subject 5 is growing more and more restless.

761
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,800
I told Spook we need more funds for sedatives.

762
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,040
But she just laughed and flew into the ceiling!

763
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,280
Without more chemicals to keep these things down.

764
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
So I'm not sure how much more...

765
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,060
How much longer we can keep them here safely.

766
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,100
Generic lab assistant.

767
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,080
I got the key card.

768
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,700
Where does that take me though?

769
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,660
Uh oh.

770
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,720
Something's really loud.

771
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,020
It sounds like something's right behind this door.

772
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:34,930
What is that?

773
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,950
Uh oh.

774
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,830
He's gonna come out of the ceiling.

775
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,150
I believe Subject 5 is loose!

776
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,510
The glass around its container is shattered.

777
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,750
I can faintly hear clicking coming from the ceiling.

778
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,270
I don't know what will happen now.

779
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,970
If it is out and alive, then it is probably my last resort.

780
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,810
The clicking is getting louder now.

781
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,450
Oh no!

782
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,290
Generic lab...

783
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:52,550
Ah!

784
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,250
Oh shoot.

785
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:56,690
Ah!

786
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,870
How did I live?

787
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,160
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

788
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,780
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

789
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,500
Oh my god.

790
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,700
It's not... I kind of hear the clicking.

791
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,260
Ouch!

792
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,060
Ouchy, ouchy, ouchy.

793
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,540
Oh god, oh god, he's gonna kill me.

794
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,160
Oh god, he's gonna kill me real.

795
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,880
Oh god, I'm trying to run.

796
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,880
I'm trying to sprint.

797
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,640
Okay.

798
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,740
Oh my god.

799
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,740
This is messed up.

800
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,300
Get out of my eyes!

801
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,720
Oh yeah.

802
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,120
Oh yeah.

803
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,920
Oh my god, oh my god.

804
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,340
Oh my god, he's gonna come out from the ceiling.

805
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,060
Yep!

806
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,860
Oh god, I'm just gonna run to the end.

807
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,560
Yep!

808
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,300
Ah!

809
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,840
I scream!

810
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,180
We all scream!

811
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,260
Four!

812
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,740
Oh shoot.

813
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:08,750
I wasn't gaming.

814
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,610
I should have...

815
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,610
I should have known.

816
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,890
Is it the same layout as before?

817
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,690
Is it the same layout as before?

818
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,810
If it is...

819
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,770
Yes, it is!

820
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:20,930
Hallelujah!

821
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,230
Okay.

822
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:30,190
Oh, I think I'm safer now.

823
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,570
The music stopped.

824
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,930
Eric, thanks for the...

825
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,430
Oh, he's screaming.

826
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,610
I want some cookies and cream right now.

827
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,890
I want some cookies and cream right now.

828
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,510
He's generated even.

829
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,730
How kind.

830
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,380
Me!

831
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,720
Free!

832
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,420
I scream!

833
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,920
Oh, you're the brains behind this operation, eh?

834
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,120
Hmm.

835
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,240
Very cool.

836
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,080
Which way did I come from?

837
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,100
135?

838
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,900
Oh, green.

839
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,820
Goop room.

840
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:17,880
Ah.

841
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,520
Subject 5 is probably the main specimen that scares me way more than the goop.

842
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,400
Is there some...

843
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,500
Wait.

844
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,520
Should I be scared of the goop?

845
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,780
Wait.

846
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,980
Should I be...

847
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,180
Oh, I think my cat went out in a second.

848
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,480
Hold on.

849
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,500
Should I be afraid of the goop?

850
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:33,700
Ah!

851
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,040
I like the decor.

852
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,360
How you doing, pies?

853
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,780
She's just walking around.

854
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,340
Hold on.

855
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,540
Are you okay?

856
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,940
Yeah, let me let her out of my room.

857
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,940
One second.

858
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,980
Come here, girly girl.

859
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,940
You stinky girl.

860
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,680
When she gets too excited, she farts.

861
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,860
She stinks up the place.

862
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh, let me let her out.

863
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,880
One second.

864
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,360
Hmm.

865
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,940
One of my cats does the same.

866
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,080
Yeah, cats are so funny.

867
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,700
Hello, Chatomito.

868
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,080
Hello!

869
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,520
I'm telling you.

870
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,740
This is like...

871
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,740
the most romantic.

872
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,620
Oh.

873
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,500
It's just like...

874
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,340
It's trying to get closer to me even.

875
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,300
Oh.

876
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,520
I think the goop is flirting with me.

877
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,560
Donk?

878
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,760
What does donk mean?

879
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,380
Donk?

880
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,100
Donk?

881
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,300
Donk?

882
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:08,840
Donk?

883
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,640
Oh, ding!

884
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,140
Okay, so...

885
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,180
Huh?

886
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,960
Ding?

887
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,080
Donk?

888
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,480
Donk?

889
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:24,700
Donk?

890
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,460
Ding?

891
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:30,980
Ding?

892
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,100
Right?

893
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:32,540
Left?

894
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,300
Straight?

895
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,700
Right?

896
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,060
Left?

897
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,340
Right?

898
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,300
Right?

899
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,560
Left?

900
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:40,800
Right?

901
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,000
Right?

902
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,220
Straight?

903
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,240
Right?

904
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,460
Right?

905
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,220
Right?

906
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,440
Right?

907
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:56,540
Left?

908
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,340
Right?

909
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,380
Right?

910
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,920
Okay, right?

911
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,060
Yippee!

912
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,080
Yippee!

913
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,680
Don't go to the light.

914
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,140
Gosh, that was like really familiar.

915
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,920
You did it.

916
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:21,980
Yay!

917
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,320
Where's the windfisher?

918
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,140
Boop, boop, boop!

919
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,860
Boop, boop!

920
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,920
Shit!

921
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,560
Wait, there's no music now.

922
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,720
To tell me if I'm getting chased or not.

923
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,260
To tell me if I'm getting chased or not.

924
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,650
To tell me if I'm getting chased or not.

925
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:47,490
Yippee!

926
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,310
150.

927
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,330
You're being chased.

928
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,490
Keep that blood pumping.

929
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:56,930
Keep that blood pumping.

930
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,930
Axe, chop till you drop.

931
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,990
Hmm.

932
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,140
Here we go.

933
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,800
Here we go.

934
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,340
Love the view.

935
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,730
There's 850 more rooms!

936
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:20,690
Wooo!

937
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,230
Wooo!

938
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,590
From a week-long trip.

939
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:27,930
From a week-long trip.

940
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:28,490
Week -long!

941
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,270
Wowee.

942
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,870
Hope you had fun.

943
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,870
I wonder what the theme is going to be this time.

944
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,410
We had specimens.

945
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,950
I'm done with jail.

946
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,650
Give me goop.

947
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,630
Can't help but imagine someone making sugar cookies.

948
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,050
Oh my gosh.

949
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,370
Minto.

950
00:45:54,110 --> 00:46:01,210
If I could collaborate with a bakery, they make minto cookies.

951
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,050
That would be so fun.

952
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,410
Okay, we're getting more goop now.

953
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,270
I'm getting more goop now.

954
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:07,290
I'm getting more goop now.

955
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:07,410
I'm getting more goop now.

956
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,070
That's what I'm talking about.

957
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,710
Okay, we're getting way more goop.

958
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:13,230
Oh shoot.

959
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:14,610
Oh gosh.

960
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,650
I heard him.

961
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,090
No!

962
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:19,570
No!

963
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,350
Oh!

964
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,180
We're in a school!

965
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:24,780
Oh gosh.

966
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,100
How do I know if I'm getting chased?

967
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,380
Locked.

968
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,720
This one's kind of spooky.

969
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,360
Actually.

970
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,420
I don't like it.

971
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,400
It's just a flashlight.

972
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,540
Wait, I'm scared!

973
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,220
Ah!

974
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,300
Oh, there's classrooms.

975
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,800
Why is this in Japanese?

976
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,380
Why is this in Japanese?

977
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,740
Oh my god.

978
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:48,840
Okay.

979
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,940
I can't read.

980
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:56,850
What?

981
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,400
Huh?

982
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,460
I don't think it...

983
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,060
That's it.

984
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,640
I can't read the first two.

985
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,400
I can read them like...

986
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,340
Two... something.

987
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,100
Maybe?

988
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,840
I can't remember.

989
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,300
I think it's gibberish.

990
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,120
Because it doesn't...

991
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,940
Oh, let's keep going.

992
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,440
I'm hearing things.

993
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:36,580
Locked.

994
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,920
Is this where I came from?

995
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,540
Oh, there's a note.

996
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,320
I can't read it.

997
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,120
Matsuri!

998
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,480
Never came to class today.

999
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,620
I hope she made it home okay.

1000
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,160
Matsuri of Hololive fame!

1001
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,260
Matsuri of Hololive fame!

1002
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:54,980
Hatsune Miku!

1003
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:57,760
Uh oh.

1004
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,440
I don't like that.

1005
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,340
I don't like that at all.

1006
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,320
Am I going the right way?

1007
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,410
Where's the person?

1008
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:19,270
Where's the person?

1009
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,450
Where's the person?

1010
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,450
Oh, this is the first one.

1011
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:21,630
Wait.

1012
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,130
I think I'm lost.

1013
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,270
Wait, maybe I went down this...

1014
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,250
Maybe I'm supposed to go this way.

1015
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,090
Oh, there it is.

1016
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,170
We're heading... we're continuing forward, everybody.

1017
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,730
Not to worry.

1018
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,130
What's that sound?

1019
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,030
That's a light.

1020
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:51,850
Locked.

1021
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:54,490
Okay.

1022
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:59,110
Three months keeping me alive through my thesis.

1023
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,150
Oh my god, Esper!

1024
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,110
You got this!

1025
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,150
You got this.

1026
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,250
Oh my gosh!

1027
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:06,870
It's Doom!

1028
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,330
Oh, what's that sound?

1029
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:13,670
What's chasing me?

1030
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,110
I don't even know what's chasing me.

1031
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,210
I don't even know what's chasing me.

1032
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,530
I don't even know what's chasing me.

1033
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,870
I don't even know what's chasing me.

1034
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,870
Why has it got to be a skelly man that spooks me, man?

1035
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:27,650
Why has it got to be a skelly man that spooks me, man?

1036
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,030
What's chasing me?

1037
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,110
It sounds lovely though!

1038
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,270
That's me!

1039
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,390
Oh my god, it's getting really loud.

1040
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,350
Oh shit, it's getting really... I think we're okay.

1041
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,530
I mean, we're not okay, but you know what I mean.

1042
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,720
Leave me alone!

1043
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,180
Just wants a hug.

1044
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,200
Is she gonna chase me forever?

1045
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,600
Until 200?

1046
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,880
I

1047
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,270
think we made it!

1048
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:42,410
Now there's just another ambiance that's freaking me out.

1049
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:45,610
You sure?

1050
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,770
Just run.

1051
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:56,870
Yeah!

1052
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,970
Oh no, 10 more!

1053
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,440
10 more!

1054
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,140
Until... safe... room... right?

1055
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,320
It's every...

1056
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,860
I'm going, I'm going.

1057
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,420
She just went to Membu ship.

1058
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,600
Hello?

1059
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:33,830
Yes, hello?

1060
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:34,910
Hello?

1061
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:38,550
Hello?

1062
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,270
Hello?

1063
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,570
Hello?

1064
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,370
Hello?

1065
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,330
Hello?

1066
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:55,810
Hi!

1067
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:56,710
Ah!

1068
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,730
Hello?

1069
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:05,750
Oh!

1070
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,390
Wait!

1071
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,710
They were responding finally!

1072
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:08,350
No!

1073
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,210
Oh shoot!

1074
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,070
No!

1075
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:17,350
No...no...no!

1076
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,810
Who are you talking to?

1077
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,390
We made it!

1078
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,290
Hang in...wait, where's our other poster?

1079
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,350
Should be a heart rate monitor for this?

1080
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,690
Oh my gosh...no!

1081
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,230
Monsters and ghosts are just misunderstood.

1082
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,250
They want to be friends.

1083
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,170
Yeah!

1084
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,070
I

1085
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,820
wonder what ever happened to that guy that drank the wine.

1086
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,600
Whoa!

1087
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,100
It's going pretty fast.

1088
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,240
So cute.

1089
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,100
Wow!

1090
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,840
SCP decor!

1091
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:17,980
Uh oh.

1092
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,540
Oh no, not this again.

1093
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,800
No, not this room again.

1094
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,500
No.

1095
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,640
Oh wait.

1096
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh, oh, I missed it already.

1097
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,900
Not this one again.

1098
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,260
Wait, which way do I go?

1099
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,560
Oh, here's a note!

1100
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,200
This is such a surprise that there...oh!

1101
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,340
Oh wait, it's the same note as before.

1102
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,880
Oh, but it didn't work.

1103
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:47,960
Okay.

1104
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,140
Do I go back?

1105
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,040
Maybe I read it and then go to the next one?

1106
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,680
What the?

1107
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,420
Ah!

1108
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,000
Yippee!

1109
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,960
Who's sitting in the time-out chair?

1110
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,260
Who's sitting in the time-out chair?

1111
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,880
Little dummy.

1112
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,500
I wonder if this will ever be in order.

1113
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,360
Shame corner.

1114
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,220
Shame, shame, shame.

1115
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,060
Oh no, all the posters.

1116
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,300
La, la, la, la.

1117
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:00,720
Oh.

1118
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,620
Hey, this all looks so familiar.

1119
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,890
This all looks so familiar.

1120
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:13,990
Hmm.

1121
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:17,890
The despair chair.

1122
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,410
You can't fall down?

1123
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,630
Yeah, you can't fall.

1124
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,010
Which is pretty nice, actually.

1125
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,230
Guess you can only die...

1126
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:29,930
What the?

1127
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:30,890
What was that?

1128
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,170
Oh.

1129
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,020
I didn't even see it.

1130
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,140
Gamers don't look up.

1131
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,060
Oh.

1132
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:39,820
Oh.

1133
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,360
Ah!

1134
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,220
Yeah, we've been here before too.

1135
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:44,780
Hmm.

1136
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,400
We went to the left on...

1137
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:49,940
Silent Hill?

1138
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,560
Oh no.

1139
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,220
Maybe I should have gone to the left again.

1140
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,980
I don't like this.

1141
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,180
I don't like this.

1142
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,480
Oh my god!

1143
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,720
The darkness is slowly consuming us now.

1144
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,800
I don't think our rituals will appease it much longer.

1145
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,880
How are we supposed to know this would happen?

1146
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,040
This is so...

1147
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,880
Feels so Silent Hill 3.

1148
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,500
It's not really our fault.

1149
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,160
We just did what Mother has told us to do in this sort of situation.

1150
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,760
Oh.

1151
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,220
Broken.

1152
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:42,740
Mother is not pleased with us, but how were we supposed to know that the girl wasn't pure?

1153
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,140
What was that?

1154
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,000
Oh.

1155
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:47,340
Breathe.

1156
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,040
Weird.

1157
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:58,630
We're getting all the lore here.

1158
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,110
Oh my goodness.

1159
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,110
What did you do to be behind here?

1160
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,350
Um.

1161
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:08,650
Wait.

1162
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,090
Which way?

1163
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,770
This way, right?

1164
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,030
Broken.

1165
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,050
We're getting all the lore in here.

1166
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:14,970
Oh.

1167
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:15,690
Not in there.

1168
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:17,590
Broke.

1169
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,090
We're getting all the lore in here.

1170
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:19,490
Broke.

1171
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,150
Oh.

1172
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:22,970
This one again.

1173
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:23,810
I think.

1174
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,930
Let's just go straight.

1175
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,270
My vision.

1176
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,530
Looks like a QR code.

1177
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:37,990
Oh my god.

1178
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,050
I know I'm going slow.

1179
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,250
I'm just...

1180
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:41,390
Oh.

1181
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,830
Okay.

1182
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:45,150
I think I need to go fast now.

1183
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,070
I think I need to go fast.

1184
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:49,930
Oh my god.

1185
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:50,410
Woah.

1186
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:51,230
Woah.

1187
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:59,250
Woah.

1188
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,580
This is really trippy.

1189
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,540
Woah.

1190
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,760
Woah.

1191
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,980
Oh my god.

1192
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:13,500
My brain.

1193
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,560
Woah.

1194
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,780
I don't feel like I'm moving at all.

1195
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,380
Oh my god.

1196
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,660
No.

1197
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,040
Why was he right there?

1198
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:41,610
I'm just gonna go to the end.

1199
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,590
Oh my goodness.

1200
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,400
We made it.

1201
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,020
Are you safe?

1202
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:09,520
I think so.

1203
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,600
We'll be safer.

1204
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:12,940
No!

1205
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,020
Oh, wait.

1206
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,300
Oh shit, never mind.

1207
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:16,840
Just kidding!

1208
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,570
This is fucked up.

1209
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,510
Where's my safe room?

1210
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,330
Oh wait, it's every 50, isn't it?

1211
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,170
I'm an idiot!

1212
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,640
No!

1213
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:41,750
I missed your mother!

1214
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:46,390
I can't even get scared by you!

1215
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,470
Oh my goodness.

1216
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,270
No, not the goop right in front of the door!

1217
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:01,230
I can't even appreciate the rooms.

1218
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:03,250
I just gotta run from goop, guys.

1219
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:07,830
Okay.

1220
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,190
Alright, these are all the same.

1221
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,170
Oh gosh.

1222
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:12,690
More goop.

1223
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,710
Confusion over fear.

1224
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:28,970
That was unfair!

1225
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:29,790
Oh wait!

1226
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,750
I thought I was safe finally!

1227
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,270
You're never safe in the spooky mansion!

1228
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:38,830
Oh my god, oh my god.

1229
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,510
Run, run, run.

1230
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,630
Oh, there's a chair up there for some reason.

1231
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,690
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1232
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:49,530
Oh my god, oh my god!

1233
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,520
Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao.

1234
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,590
We're almost there, we're almost there!

1235
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:05,990
For reals this time!

1236
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:07,670
For real this time!

1237
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:12,970
I did!

1238
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:21,690
Okay.

1239
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,520
You know, I can sound like spooky too.

1240
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,360
You're doing so great.

1241
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,380
Thank you for, um, for playing the game.

1242
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,460
Password pumpkin!

1243
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,100
Thanks for playing the game, you're doing so well.

1244
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,560
What's the password for, actually?

1245
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,540
What's this too?

1246
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,280
Thanks for the present.

1247
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:27,940
Spooky.

1248
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,500
Password pumpkin.

1249
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:39,920
Sike!

1250
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,520
I'm starting to think she doesn't like me.

1251
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,760
Is it because I'm also a ghost?

1252
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,420
Do you think she feels a little bit of...

1253
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:50,020
Um...

1254
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,820
A little bit of competition?

1255
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,560
Perhaps?

1256
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,300
Meh-hups?

1257
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,720
Little ghost rivalry?

1258
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,140
Now she's threatened by me?

1259
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:02,700
She knows.

1260
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,360
Thanks for making a video about the Akiba maid work.

1261
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,200
A pop-up.

1262
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,460
I was able to go because you let me know it existed.

1263
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,300
Yeah, of course!

1264
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,580
Thanks for watching it!

1265
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:17,920
Bye!

1266
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,440
This room stresses me out, so much.

1267
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,140
Cause it's so long, you know?

1268
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:33,600
Spitter.

1269
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,260
Little spitter guy...

1270
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,460
At least it's...

1271
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,260
I was gonna say, at least it's always the same, but it just changed!

1272
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,380
What?

1273
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,400
Good to know.

1274
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,440
It changed.

1275
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,440
Wait, but there's no note there.

1276
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,420
Oh, this again.

1277
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:52,940
Alright.

1278
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:53,460
Front!

1279
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,750
Oh, bong bong.

1280
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,270
Right.

1281
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,450
Straight.

1282
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,350
Straight.

1283
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,730
Right.

1284
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,010
Straight, right.

1285
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,130
Right.

1286
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:11,350
Okay, straight.

1287
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:12,790
Right.

1288
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,070
Right.

1289
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:14,770
Left.

1290
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:16,650
Straight, right, left.

1291
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,470
Straight, right, left.

1292
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,500
Left.

1293
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,800
Straight, right, left, left!

1294
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:34,580
Uh oh.

1295
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,280
Oh, it's the cat dogs again!

1296
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,760
What if I press it?

1297
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,480
It's pretty intimidating.

1298
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,630
Access specimen database.

1299
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,140
Docile.

1300
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,660
Total fatalities 4!

1301
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,740
Method heart attack.

1302
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,180
A cardboard cut out figure that springs out from the walls.

1303
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,720
Proved not very effective against healthy subjects.

1304
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,100
Proved not very effective against healthy subjects.

1305
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:10,940
That guy sucks.

1306
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,040
Hold on, I'm turning the music down.

1307
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,840
It's too ringy in my ears.

1308
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:16,560
Oh!

1309
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,780
This guy!

1310
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:18,500
Active.

1311
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,060
Total fatalities 137.

1312
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,240
Method physical tearing.

1313
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,100
A mostly semi-solid based specter that frequently changes matter states.

1314
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,180
Proved very effective against weaker or slower subjects.

1315
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,280
Proved very effective against weaker or slower subjects.

1316
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,860
What is this one?

1317
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,340
Infectious bite.

1318
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,660
Test specimen.

1319
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,760
Oh, being developed!

1320
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,580
This is the spider!

1321
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,680
Should prove useful when released.

1322
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,120
Trials have shown it adequately effective to average subjects.

1323
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:52,700
Oh!

1324
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,220
We've seen her.

1325
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,820
14th century spirit that was contained and relocated here.

1326
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:04,160
Tests have yet to reveal origins but all relevant information has been placed into testing chamber.

1327
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,980
Proved effective not greatly more than previous specimens.

1328
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,360
We've seen this guy too, right?

1329
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,860
He's the one that made the room all crazy.

1330
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,460
I can fix her.

1331
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,260
A creature found inside the church of a small town.

1332
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,320
Subjects are lost after contact...

1333
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,380
with the specimen.

1334
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,160
What did that say?

1335
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:34,640
What?

1336
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:35,900
Oh!

1337
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:36,360
Method!

1338
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,200
Commethed?

1339
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,660
Commethed of...

1340
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,320
Why is it written like that?

1341
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:43,880
That's bad.

1342
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,840
The killing is unknown.

1343
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:52,160
Proved extremely effective against subjects with mental issues or weak wills.

1344
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,380
Proved extremely effective against subjects with mental issues or weak wills.

1345
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh!

1346
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,360
Oh!

1347
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,300
A wooden sized life puppet.

1348
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:59,600
Oh, it's also active.

1349
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:02,880
Found floating in a reservoir where a town has once been.

1350
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:09,100
Specimen is active despite appearance and has proved very effective on subjects who disregard it or have vision impairments.

1351
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,080
Okay...

1352
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,380
What do I do with him?

1353
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,860
He looks like...

1354
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,580
Oh my gosh, he looks like Ben Drowned.

1355
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,400
Wait, someone also said Ben Drowned!

1356
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,740
He looks just like the Mask Seller.

1357
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,100
Oh, error.

1358
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,380
Dang it.

1359
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:31,640
Interesting.

1360
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,740
So we have one more guy we need to...

1361
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,100
What is that?

1362
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,400
Oh shoot.

1363
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,780
What the hell was that?

1364
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,540
I think I'm getting chased after.

1365
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,140
Oh, this guy again.

1366
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:45,920
Oh god.

1367
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,000
I've already dealt with you!

1368
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:50,420
Please!

1369
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,060
I think I go to the right now, right?

1370
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:53,300
Please be right.

1371
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:54,740
Please be correct.

1372
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:55,880
No!

1373
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,020
I'm gonna die.

1374
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,530
At least he's slow.

1375
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,730
Oh my god, he hits a lot of damage though.

1376
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:14,610
Oh my gosh.

1377
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:17,670
Please!

1378
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,490
I can't tell which way is right.

1379
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,500
Yes, okay.

1380
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,940
There's a candle there.

1381
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,520
Okay.

1382
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,820
We made it.

1383
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,800
My head hurts.

1384
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,880
How do you think I feel?

1385
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,940
Not in the green room!

1386
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,200
Goop attack!

1387
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:02,840
Goop attack!

1388
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:02,920
Goop attack!

1389
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:15,290
Is he gone?

1390
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,750
I think he's gone.

1391
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:24,390
We haven't gotten any notes or anything recently.

1392
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:25,810
We haven't gotten any notes or anything recently.

1393
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:27,690
Hey, I'm Buddy Joe and I'm lost.

1394
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,180
Oh, you guys can't see the room number?

1395
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,640
Let me move you down then.

1396
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,440
Let me move you down then.

1397
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,620
Sorry, I didn't realize you couldn't see the room number.

1398
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:46,700
Oh wait, hold on.

1399
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:47,180
One more second.

1400
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,360
Now you can.

1401
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,200
Okay.

1402
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,740
I never go this way.

1403
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,720
Oh, it's just a loop.

1404
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,280
The other way is faster.

1405
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:09,820
Okay.

1406
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:12,880
Oh!

1407
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,620
Oh!

1408
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,300
Hello?

1409
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:16,660
Hello?

1410
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:18,980
Hello?

1411
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,000
Hello?

1412
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,780
Hello?

1413
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:26,470
I don't know if you want to look directly into the fan.

1414
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,250
Um, yes, hello?

1415
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:28,250
Hello?

1416
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:28,610
Hello?

1417
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,550
I was counting the whole time.

1418
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:33,630
Hi!

1419
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:34,870
Hello?

1420
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:38,930
Yes, hi.

1421
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,370
Hello?

1422
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,030
Hello?

1423
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:40,550
Hi.

1424
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,250
Hello?

1425
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,890
I don't know if you want to look directly into the fan.

1426
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,670
Um, yes, hello?

1427
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:45,710
Hello?

1428
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:46,450
Hello?

1429
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:47,730
Hello?

1430
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,010
Hello?

1431
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:54,090
Uh oh.

1432
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:55,370
Uh oh.

1433
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,910
This music sounds different.

1434
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,170
Oh, read.

1435
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,830
I think this is my last note.

1436
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,990
I'm going to die having never found my escape.

1437
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,010
But that's really not...

1438
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,290
But that's really...

1439
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,750
But really that's not true.

1440
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,350
This place was like my escape.

1441
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:12,790
My escape from everything else.

1442
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:15,410
In the end, my death is kind of romantic.

1443
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,690
In the end, my death is kind of romantic.

1444
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,210
Our romance sky!

1445
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,170
This place is finally starting to affect me.

1446
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:27,890
I've seen enough horror movies to know how to survive a simple ghost or two.

1447
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:27,990
I've seen enough horror movies to know how to survive a simple ghost or two.

1448
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,870
But these monsters keep getting faster and stranger.

1449
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,960
Is that a different man?

1450
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,280
Unless we're just seeing some of his notes now.

1451
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,060
This death is so romantic.

1452
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:43,400
This death is so romantic.

1453
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,400
To be or not to be.

1454
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:51,890
Uh oh.

1455
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,010
I'm getting...

1456
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:53,330
Yep.

1457
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,310
No!

1458
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,050
Not you guys!

1459
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,050
Leave me alone!

1460
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,900
Goopy ghost.

1461
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,540
Goopy ghost.

1462
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,460
Goopy ghost.

1463
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:11,960
Goopy ghost.

1464
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,380
Goopy ghost.

1465
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:16,540
Would you guys prefer if I was more goopy or...

1466
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,340
How do you like your ghosts?

1467
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,700
How do you like your ghosts?

1468
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:21,900
How do you like your ghosts?

1469
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:26,720
Moist?

1470
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,180
Am I going the right way?

1471
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:30,920
Please say yes.

1472
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,560
More wispy.

1473
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,440
You're fine the way you are?

1474
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,020
You're so sweet!

1475
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,140
You accept me as I am?

1476
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,460
You accept me as I am?

1477
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,200
Yippee!

1478
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,040
I wish I could crouch.

1479
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,020
Wait, what's it say?

1480
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,960
In order to survive this house, I need to keep writing notes.

1481
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,720
Must do everything a central protagonist would and hope this is one of those stories.

1482
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,460
Insert obscure horror reference that no one gets and misinterprets as instruction somehow.

1483
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,360
Is this him?

1484
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:23,860
No.

1485
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,020
This is great for me though.

1486
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,280
I think I'm in love with him.

1487
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:28,680
This is great for me though.

1488
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,180
I think I'm in love with him!

1489
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,980
And now he's a ghost!

1490
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,140
We can be together!

1491
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,000
This is our true romance.

1492
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,980
I want your lovin' I want your romance You and me, we'll write a good romance

1493
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,500
Caught in a spooky mansion

1494
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:06,040
Caught in a spooky mansion Spooky mansion Green Pink

1495
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:21,520
Petavie He's gonna get me!

1496
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,520
He's gonna get me!

1497
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:22,900
Attack me!

1498
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,560
He's gonna get me.

1499
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:45,580
He's gonna get me!

1500
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,660
I was not afraid.

1501
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:53,680
I was not afraid.

1502
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,440
Hi.

1503
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,880
Of course we accept you as you are.

1504
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,460
The coolest, prettiest, cutest ghost?

1505
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,120
Oh wait, Polly from Mon...

1506
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:08,460
The only Polly I know is Polly Pocket.

1507
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,600
Let's try again.

1508
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,360
Maybe if I read it enough.

1509
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,280
Maybe it knows that I'm not reading it.

1510
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,000
Shame.

1511
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,600
What's this music?

1512
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,280
Or rather, ambience.

1513
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,180
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

1514
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,280
Read, Minto, read.

1515
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,840
I've read it before!

1516
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:54,340
That's a mute.

1517
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,360
Why is it...

1518
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,060
Uh oh.

1519
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:58,340
Woah.

1520
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,180
Woah!

1521
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,060
Woah!

1522
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:09,260
Oh.

1523
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,320
Oh!

1524
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,040
This one.

1525
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:13,740
Cool!

1526
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:14,800
Oh, it's locked.

1527
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:16,520
Um...

1528
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:18,940
Can I just run through?

1529
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,320
Try this one.

1530
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,260
Oh...

1531
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,280
Wow!

1532
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:27,640
Wow!

1533
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,120
Oh...

1534
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,660
I can't... wait.

1535
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,300
Okay, there we go.

1536
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,260
One day a strange merchant came to town.

1537
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:37,120
He sold handmade puppets and trinkets to all the children...

1538
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,700
and all the children loved his store and his gifts.

1539
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,840
But the town couldn't support his store because of...

1540
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,280
the other shops were failing.

1541
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,220
The other shopkeepers became jealous.

1542
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,680
So one night, some of the townspeople took all his puppets...

1543
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,840
and threw them into the river!

1544
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,000
Uh oh.

1545
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,780
Uh oh, we're on the puppet guy.

1546
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,320
Pick up the key.

1547
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,080
But just afterwards...

1548
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,200
he came running to the river crying and wailing...

1549
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,720
that his children were being drow...

1550
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,540
bed drowned.

1551
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,360
He dove into the river...

1552
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,340
trying to save his possessions.

1553
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,360
The townspeople, bitter and still angry...

1554
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,800
watched him frantically thrash and dive into the river...

1555
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,160
until he never came back...

1556
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,580
to the surface...

1557
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,760
of the water.

1558
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:16,760
Ben drowned real!

1559
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,900
What do I do with this...

1560
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:24,940
with the puppet though?

1561
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,020
It said like I should...

1562
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,160
pay attention to him or something?

1563
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:31,460
Oh.

1564
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,280
Oh.

1565
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,020
Hold on, let's read first.

1566
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,280
Hold on, maybe it's this one.

1567
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:47,800
Oh.

1568
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,080
Although not what they wanted...

1569
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,560
the shopkeepers were satisfied.

1570
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,960
Years later...

1571
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,680
the children of the town began to go missing.

1572
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,040
And as more and more children disappeared...

1573
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,600
people began to find more and more puppets in the forest...

1574
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,860
and around the river.

1575
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,580
These puppets seemed almost to look like...

1576
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,960
the missing children sometimes.

1577
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,300
What do you say mint for?

1578
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:14,600
What happened?

1579
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:19,660
I don't know.

1580
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,520
Swimming lessons get good, Ben.

1581
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:37,950
I'm quite spooked by this.

1582
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,020
He has a key.

1583
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,440
I think.

1584
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,160
Nope, he has a thing to kill me.

1585
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,160
Oh, he looks really sad.

1586
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:04,550
Ouch!

1587
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,490
I'm sorry.

1588
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:07,890
Wait,

1589
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:12,890
what just happened?

1590
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:14,590
Oh.

1591
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,150
Yes, sir.

1592
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:18,350
Oh, shoot.

1593
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:19,930
Yes, sir.

1594
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:21,430
No, sir.

1595
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,230
There he is.

1596
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,370
Just keep on going.

1597
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:40,450
Oh, I can open with my back.

1598
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,380
Oh my gosh.

1599
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:45,800
Open.

1600
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,280
Nice.

1601
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:49,980
Hello.

1602
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:52,260
Okay.

1603
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,480
Okay.

1604
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,800
This is fine.

1605
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,340
Open.

1606
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,980
How am I opening them?

1607
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:58,820
I don't know.

1608
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,380
Oh, gosh.

1609
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,160
With the goop?

1610
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,420
Oh, this is kind of evil, isn't it?

1611
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,240
Yes, sir.

1612
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,460
Yes, sir.

1613
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:10,900
Yes, sir.

1614
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:11,880
Oh my gosh.

1615
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,880
Oh my god.

1616
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:16,400
No way.

1617
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,300
He looks...

1618
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,320
Oh god.

1619
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,220
Okay.

1620
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:26,000
We've gone through this room so many times.

1621
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,400
We've gone through this room so many times.

1622
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:40,800
Once I can't see him anymore, I have to find out where he goes.

1623
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:41,100
Okay.

1624
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,440
We got this.

1625
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,200
I'm doing my best.

1626
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,960
I'm like, I've done this room so many times.

1627
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,020
I'm going to know where he's at.

1628
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,820
Or I'm going to know how to get there.

1629
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:54,100
Wait.

1630
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:54,900
Oh, shoot.

1631
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,260
Maybe this way.

1632
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,280
Okay.

1633
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,300
It was the other...

1634
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:15,620
Ouch!

1635
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,620
I was looking at you, you little bitch.

1636
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,100
Don't even...

1637
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,560
Don't even act like that to me.

1638
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,840
I was giving you all the attention that you...

1639
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,200
desired.

1640
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:25,440
Okay.

1641
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:27,540
Okay, okay.

1642
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:28,600
We're fine.

1643
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,500
We're fine, everybody.

1644
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:30,840
Am I going the right way?

1645
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,000
Yeah.

1646
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,000
We're fine.

1647
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:37,130
Ouch!

1648
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,450
We made it!

1649
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:44,110
Oh my god.

1650
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:48,390
Which one's that?

1651
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:00,170
Which one's that?

1652
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,590
You walk into him?

1653
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:03,710
No, I think you can walk into him, right?

1654
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:05,070
It's just...

1655
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,800
It's just...

1656
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,460
Yeah, he's persistent, isn't he?

1657
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,860
Yeah, he's persistent, isn't he?

1658
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,240
Oh!

1659
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:21,880
Oh my god!

1660
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,580
We did it!

1661
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,300
We did it!

1662
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:23,860
We did it!

1663
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,980
Oh, he'll hurt you if you walk into him?

1664
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:26,580
Oh, okay.

1665
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,000
I'm just kidding.

1666
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:34,610
Sometimes there's that...

1667
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:36,250
really loud ambiance.

1668
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:39,790
Hear it?

1669
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:41,450
It's a big old rumbling in my ear.

1670
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:47,790
What is that sound?

1671
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:51,790
Oh, no, please.

1672
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:52,770
Oh, wait.

1673
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:53,930
Oh, I knew it!

1674
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:54,890
I was like, wait, I'm slow.

1675
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:55,690
Why am I slow?

1676
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:57,430
Oh, come on.

1677
01:22:57,670 --> 01:22:58,890
These guys cheat!

1678
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:00,990
Oh, you are cheating for real.

1679
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:03,370
Please be right.

1680
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:04,110
Please be right.

1681
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:04,790
Please be right.

1682
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:06,010
Yes.

1683
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,590
I hear you.

1684
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,990
Not the goop ghost!

1685
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,540
Not the goop ghost!

1686
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:22,600
Not the goop ghost!

1687
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:22,720
No!

1688
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,260
Oh, gosh.

1689
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,160
Oh, gosh.

1690
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:28,360
Oh, gosh.

1691
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,260
I'm just gonna guess.

1692
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,960
I think I'm right.

1693
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,080
Nice.

1694
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,700
Oh my gosh.

1695
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,160
Too much goop!

1696
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:41,740
Too much goop!

1697
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,780
Too much goop!

1698
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:45,480
Too much goop!

1699
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:48,020
There never has to be a goopy ghost!

1700
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:54,440
Nice.

1701
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,140
There's no clipping.

1702
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,020
Oh, gosh.

1703
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:01,780
Oh my gosh.

1704
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:02,400
Still more.

1705
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,420
Not the ectoplasm.

1706
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,520
This is a severe case of ectoplasm.

1707
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:13,620
This is a severe case of ectoplasm.

1708
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,200
I'll tell you that.

1709
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,060
I would never all over the floor.

1710
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,200
Maybe once.

1711
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:27,330
I think we're good.

1712
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:28,190
Nice!

1713
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,850
I think we're okay.

1714
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:34,050
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

1715
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,310
What are these sounds?

1716
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:42,670
Oh.

1717
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:44,250
This room again.

1718
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:46,890
We went to the right last time.

1719
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:47,650
Let's go to the left.

1720
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:49,370
The right was really scary.

1721
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,050
And I didn't like it.

1722
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:56,380
Oh.

1723
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,260
Wait a second.

1724
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,420
Is this it?

1725
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:01,380
Wait.

1726
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,600
Where's my checkpoint?

1727
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,240
Wait.

1728
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,200
Wait.

1729
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,560
I'm at 350.

1730
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,120
Wait.

1731
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,060
My checkpoint.

1732
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,560
No way.

1733
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:30,030
God.

1734
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:30,730
Oh my god.

1735
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:44,290
Once they start introducing this guy with other characters, it's going to be...

1736
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:45,030
It's so jover.

1737
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:55,940
Just run.

1738
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:00,500
I'm surprised I lived through that.

1739
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,200
Not going to lie.

1740
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:01,740
Oh gosh.

1741
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:08,540
No stamina.

1742
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:13,640
Oh gosh.

1743
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,660
He's probably the trickiest in the game.

1744
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,960
He is tricky.

1745
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:31,960
He is tricky.

1746
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,440
Ta-da.

1747
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,430
Open him up my cheeks.

1748
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:45,090
I feel like I don't even have a chance to retry anymore.

1749
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:48,150
I'm fighting for my afterlife here.

1750
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:50,170
I'm fighting for my afterlife here.

1751
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,390
I'm fighting for my afterlife here.

1752
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:51,670
Hey.

1753
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:52,330
Hey.

1754
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:54,050
You?

1755
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:56,290
Yeah, you?

1756
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,040
Hey Mint, look here.

1757
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,220
I see you.

1758
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,020
Okay.

1759
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,400
What are you hiding behind your back there, buddy?

1760
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,880
He looks really sheepish.

1761
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,800
He's like, oh gosh.

1762
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,480
I just want to be friends with you.

1763
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,300
I wouldn't hurt you ever.

1764
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,600
You're my bestie.

1765
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,060
Look at that.

1766
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,360
He's shy.

1767
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,640
Um, yeah.

1768
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,440
Me too.

1769
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:36,960
I actually don't know if I can fall into the goo.

1770
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,860
I would really not like to find out.

1771
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:45,860
Where are you?

1772
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,760
Did he give up?

1773
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:54,130
Oh, it's this room again.

1774
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:56,850
Alrighty.

1775
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:58,150
Let's go right.

1776
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,930
Bing bong.

1777
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:00,670
Left.

1778
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:02,610
Left.

1779
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:03,210
Straight.

1780
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:04,430
Left.

1781
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:04,910
Straight.

1782
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,590
Left.

1783
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:07,110
Left.

1784
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:07,570
Straight.

1785
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:07,910
Left.

1786
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:08,710
Right.

1787
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:10,610
Left.

1788
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,290
Straight.

1789
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,130
Left.

1790
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,190
Straight.

1791
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:19,650
Oh.

1792
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:21,990
Yippee.

1793
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,690
Bong bong.

1794
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,130
I like the pink rooms.

1795
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:36,210
Back rooms, yellow rooms, pink rooms.

1796
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,410
Green rooms.

1797
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:43,350
Mint gaming.

1798
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:43,930
Haha.

1799
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:46,090
Yeah.

1800
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:47,530
Hehehe.

1801
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:51,410
Orange rooms?

1802
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:51,890
No.

1803
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,550
Nah, I love orange.

1804
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,050
My Oshis color is orange.

1805
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,210
Actually, I feel like I have an Oshi that is every color at this point.

1806
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,060
My Oshis are the dang rainbow at this point.

1807
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,040
Quite the long room.

1808
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,440
A true DD.

1809
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,260
I know.

1810
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,270
But usually...

1811
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:24,820
I pick...

1812
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,800
Usually my favorite members are blue.

1813
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:37,310
Your Oshi is Garfield and yours isn't?

1814
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:39,370
Woah.

1815
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:40,930
Woah.

1816
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,070
Woah.

1817
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,050
Oh no.

1818
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,260
Am I being chased through here?

1819
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,100
Please say no.

1820
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,780
Is Sonic your Oshi?

1821
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:56,640
Hmm.

1822
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,560
When I was a kid I used to like Tails.

1823
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,800
The most.

1824
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:02,620
Oh gosh.

1825
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,100
So...

1826
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,240
The Smurfs?

1827
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,340
I love...

1828
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,540
blue people.

1829
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,480
Base Tails enjoyer.

1830
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,560
I always thought he was so cute.

1831
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,380
There's different kinds of ghosts.

1832
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,380
I wonder what kind you are, Mint.

1833
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:25,380
Revenant?

1834
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:25,920
Poltergeist?

1835
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,480
Wraith perhaps?

1836
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:27,900
I'm a Yurei.

1837
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,820
I'm a vengeful ghost.

1838
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:37,800
Uh oh.

1839
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:38,800
What's that sound?

1840
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:42,700
What is this?

1841
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,560
What's chasing after me?

1842
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:45,960
Is this the girl?

1843
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:46,700
Wait, what is this?

1844
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,080
Wait, what is this?

1845
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:51,020
Oh, it's this...

1846
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,100
room again.

1847
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,580
But we already did this, right?

1848
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,140
Is there anything new?

1849
01:30:58,680 --> 01:30:59,320
Is there anything new?

1850
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,460
Specimen 7.

1851
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,740
Did I even miss this before?

1852
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,400
Did I even miss this before?

1853
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:15,880
Specimen is constantly changing form and attributes depending on subject's personality but most common form resembles a wall of moving anatomy symbols.

1854
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:20,140
Only effective on subjects with past trauma or a history of psychological issues.

1855
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,420
Me?

1856
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,050
Outer Wilds!

1857
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:29,830
Absorption?

1858
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:37,070
A floating figure that appeared in a test chamber a few years after it was filled with what was believed to be...

1859
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:41,010
to just be unusually violent deer.

1860
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:46,250
Specimen seems to engulf subjects and absorb them into its torso region.

1861
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:48,890
Proved extremely effective on violent subjects.

1862
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:50,730
Deer.

1863
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:54,070
Deer.

1864
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:58,650
Deer, deer, deer, deer, deer, deer...

1865
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:00,850
Dang it.

1866
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:03,490
It'll let me modify it eventually, right?

1867
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:07,830
Oh, there we go...

1868
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,480
games.

1869
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,960
Deer, deer, deer, deer...

1870
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,860
Nooooooo!

1871
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,780
Deer, deer, deer, deer, deer, deer!

1872
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,380
Oh no!

1873
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:31,240
No no no no no no no no no no!

1874
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,600
Just three more, three more maybe?

1875
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:33,500
Hopefully?

1876
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:35,740
Hopefully?

1877
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:36,880
Hopefully?

1878
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,620
Oh yeah!

1879
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,740
Oh!

1880
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,680
Oh!

1881
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,360
Four hundred!

1882
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:56,340
Yippee!

1883
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,120
You can do it!

1884
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,160
We can help Papa John's!

1885
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,300
Oh gosh.

1886
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:05,920
Checkpoints.

1887
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,440
So now the checkpoints are after 100?

1888
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,960
I feel like they should have changed that after 500.

1889
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,010
Papa John's is making me want pizza.

1890
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,370
Okay you guys, I gotta go to the bathroom real quick.

1891
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:25,810
I gotta go use the little ghostie's room.

1892
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:26,630
Is that okay?

1893
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:31,350
I do have some ectoplasm that must...

1894
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,030
You know what?

1895
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:33,850
I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.

1896
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:39,610
I'll be right back!

1897
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,700
Don't go anywhere.

1898
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:37,430
I'm back!

1899
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:39,210
Thanks for all the superchats!

1900
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:40,810
Thank you!

1901
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:45,310
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1902
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:47,590
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1903
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,360
I swallowed my spit wrong.

1904
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,080
Anyway...

1905
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:06,760
Let's go down!

1906
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:11,380
Did you wash your hands?

1907
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,160
Of course I did!

1908
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,120
Now I'm taking a sippy of my tea.

1909
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,860
Oh my gosh, we're almost halfway there.

1910
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,520
How long does it usually take to beat this game?

1911
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:28,300
I feel like...

1912
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:30,860
Did you save?

1913
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:31,560
I did, right?

1914
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,540
I did save, right?

1915
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,160
We're just in a big ol' dungeon.

1916
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,000
I'm gonna go down this way.

1917
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:46,580
Maybe I...

1918
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:51,330
Maybe I...

1919
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,010
Won't go down that way.

1920
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:57,830
Um...

1921
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:02,930
About three hours?

1922
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:03,350
Oh, why?

1923
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:16,260
Toast!

1924
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,180
What's the DLC like?

1925
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:25,660
Is it the same thing, but a hospital?

1926
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,680
What was that sound?

1927
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:28,480
Whoa!

1928
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:29,420
What is this?

1929
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,300
Threshold of consciousness.

1930
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,420
It was more exploratory.

1931
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,720
Here I go!

1932
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:45,400
Oh!

1933
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,440
Little cat!

1934
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,080
Cute!

1935
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:50,920
Oh, talk!

1936
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,160
Well, hello there.

1937
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,840
Are you lost, little one?

1938
01:37:55,380 --> 01:38:00,680
This place can help those who are ready, but expect turmoil more than you are used to.

1939
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:01,140
Oh!

1940
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:04,880
What's that mean?

1941
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,220
Bye-bye, Kyubey.

1942
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:08,660
Oh!

1943
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:10,020
Oh, there's the door.

1944
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:10,900
Yep.

1945
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,800
Where the heck am I?

1946
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:15,420
Oh!

1947
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,360
Okay!

1948
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,080
What that mean?

1949
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,600
Is this therapy?

1950
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:29,260
Oh my gosh, you guys!

1951
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:33,020
I have a hand cam...

1952
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:34,540
On...

1953
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,260
Wednesday?

1954
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:39,160
Oh...

1955
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:42,060
But my nails...

1956
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,680
My nail... My... Another nail of mine just broke!

1957
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:53,960
Oh, do I want to touch... I don't want that to touch me, all right?

1958
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,500
Two sides of the same coin.

1959
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:00,900
Don't be ashamed.

1960
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:01,120
Oh!

1961
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:04,420
What does that... What does that mean?

1962
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:08,780
Wow!

1963
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,800
Oh, it's pointing at me!

1964
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,560
My nails... My nails are not very nice.

1965
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,380
I think I... You know... I'm a ghost.

1966
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:29,160
It's like usually I wear gloves anyway, so you can see me better, so I'm not transparent, but...

1967
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:34,300
I might just have to... I'm worried about building it with gloves on.

1968
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:36,500
So basically I'm building like this...

1969
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:37,920
Bookshelf...

1970
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,040
Um...

1971
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,000
Thing...

1972
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:44,180
And it's... It's like... It looks like...

1973
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:44,480
Oh...

1974
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,020
Wasn't I just here?

1975
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:47,800
Oh...

1976
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,000
Diorama... Yeah!

1977
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,740
Put on your mask... Oh!

1978
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:57,660
Follow the group.

1979
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,220
Be who you are... Be... Come more than you...

1980
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:03,920
Oh, God!

1981
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:04,400
Oh, God!

1982
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:04,960
It's an office!

1983
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:05,700
Oh, my God!

1984
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:08,360
The mask you wear serves its purpose well.

1985
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:10,640
But be careful not to lose yourself.

1986
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,180
But my nails have been breaking so much this week.

1987
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:13,800
I don't know why.

1988
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,700
If you would like to name a kitten...

1989
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,220
A little black cat...

1990
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:22,600
Mint!

1991
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:27,200
Hmm...

1992
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,260
Salem?

1993
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:28,380
Salem?

1994
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,200
Liquid?

1995
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:35,300
A note.

1996
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:39,180
Well, I still haven't died, so it appears I might be the protagonist.

1997
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,680
But I'm not entirely sure.

1998
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:44,460
I hope I'm not some side character that leaves notes for pointless exposition.

1999
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:49,180
Also, I found a strange computer that gives the descriptions of the monsters.

2000
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:53,760
And it seems like they're all called effective based on how many people they kill.

2001
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,840
Yeah, I read that too.

2002
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:56,700
This guy is me!

2003
01:40:59,220 --> 01:40:59,740
Shalashaska!

2004
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,220
Shalashaska is a great name.

2005
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:03,380
Oh!

2006
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,360
Wait, there wasn't blood here on the brain before, was there?

2007
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:08,840
Uh-oh.

2008
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,780
I think Shalashaska is a great name for a cat.

2009
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,140
Let's go to the left.

2010
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:26,660
Oh, shoot.

2011
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:29,840
No!

2012
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:38,010
Oh.

2013
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:43,010
These places are like safe zones, kinda.

2014
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,330
Oh!

2015
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:05,130
I'm seeing everything, little cat.

2016
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:08,370
I've seen everything.

2017
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,020
That doesn't look good.

2018
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:21,930
Maybe I shouldn't keep talking to this guy.

2019
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:26,530
Knowing your shadow can greatly help you.

2020
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:29,150
But be ready to see what you'd rather not be.

2021
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:35,990
Oh!

2022
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:37,790
Whoa!

2023
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,100
Whoa!

2024
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,360
Uh-oh.

2025
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,220
Uh-oh.

2026
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:50,240
Uh-oh.

2027
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,060
I don't wanna know!

2028
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:51,620
I don't wanna know!

2029
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,220
I don't wanna know!

2030
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,600
Oh my god.

2031
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:57,420
Oh my god.

2032
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,220
Oh my god, I don't wanna know.

2033
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:01,140
Oh my god.

2034
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:04,880
Whoa!

2035
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,040
I like the music here, though.

2036
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:06,680
Oh my gosh.

2037
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,440
Was that a funky man?

2038
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:15,770
Oh shit!

2039
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:16,150
Oh shit!

2040
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,060
I don't know what's going on!

2041
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,880
My mind is broken!

2042
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,040
Oh, shoot.

2043
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,320
I can't tell what's going on.

2044
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:39,360
I'm just running.

2045
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,140
Can't tell.

2046
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:42,580
Just run?

2047
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:43,800
Oh, I am!

2048
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,240
Oh god.

2049
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:45,320
Oh god.

2050
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:45,980
Oh god.

2051
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:47,760
Please be correct.

2052
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:48,340
Okay.

2053
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,940
I like the BGM.

2054
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,160
It's kinda funky.

2055
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,600
I like it.

2056
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:20,340
I don't know if the guy on the wall is evil or what, but I'm not sticking around to find out.

2057
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:25,540
This guy is spread eagle over here.

2058
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:26,220
Like, come on!

2059
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:27,760
Oh!

2060
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,040
Hello, hello!

2061
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:43,840
Hello!

2062
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,160
Hello!

2063
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:45,760
Hello!

2064
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:46,680
Hello!

2065
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:50,710
All right.

2066
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,820
Oh, it's this place again.

2067
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,220
Um, right!

2068
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:02,520
Oh.

2069
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,600
Ah, left.

2070
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,400
Straight.

2071
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:07,040
Straight.

2072
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,860
That's all the Shasko it is.

2073
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:11,720
She meows to it.

2074
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,100
Left.

2075
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:15,220
Straight.

2076
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:16,080
Straight.

2077
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:45,660
Straight, right, straight, right, straight, right, left, straight, right, right, straight, right, right, left, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,

2078
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:45,700
right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,

2079
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:45,940
right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,

2080
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:46,320
right, right, right, right, right Left.

2081
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,260
Oh my god!

2082
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:53,260
It's the guy with the banana!

2083
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,480
He's back.

2084
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:14,840
I hope they're cute.

2085
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:17,500
Summarize the cat.

2086
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:21,000
Putting on personas is useful, but don't get too absorbed...

2087
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:21,300
Wait, what?

2088
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:23,060
Huh?

2089
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:26,780
Oh my gosh, what's this?

2090
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,660
It's getting so loud.

2091
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,060
Whatever this ambiance is.

2092
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:31,660
I'm just gonna keep running.

2093
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,140
I hope the antagonist is cute too.

2094
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:37,300
Woah, this is such a cool effect!

2095
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:40,740
It looks like the candle was blown out and there's the smoke from it.

2096
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:43,500
Doctor Squeals!

2097
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:44,860
Welcome to membership.

2098
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:46,000
Thank you so much!

2099
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:46,180
Thank you so much!

2100
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:51,740
Oh my god!

2101
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,960
I didn't expect a toast there!

2102
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,060
Oh, the in-game cat.

2103
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,360
Why are we talking about multiple cats?

2104
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,100
Get me out of here.

2105
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,760
Get me out of here.

2106
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:18,920
Hello, Fintmentum.

2107
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:20,620
That's not my name.

2108
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,200
Welcome to membership.

2109
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:23,480
This is awesome.

2110
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,080
Oh, sh**!

2111
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:25,660
Thank you!

2112
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:27,700
No!

2113
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:33,870
I wish I could jump.

2114
01:47:33,970 --> 01:47:34,650
I wish I could jump.

2115
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:36,570
Jump out!

2116
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:37,130
Jump out!

2117
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:37,850
This guy sucks!

2118
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:40,590
Thanks for the super chat!

2119
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:45,150
Orpheee!

2120
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:53,180
Where are you going to sleep?

2121
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:53,640
Good night!

2122
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,160
What is this?

2123
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:58,300
I'm running!

2124
01:47:59,200 --> 01:47:59,900
Oh my god.

2125
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,680
I thought I might be safe.

2126
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:03,740
Nope, I'm running slowly.

2127
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,160
Oh my goodness.

2128
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:06,980
Two in a row!

2129
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:08,260
This is messed up.

2130
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:08,820
This is messed up.

2131
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:10,020
MESSED UP MESSED UP MESSED UP MESSED UP!

2132
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,240
Oh my god, I went the wrong way.

2133
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:14,620
Shoot!

2134
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,060
Shoot shoot shoot shoot!

2135
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,840
Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot!

2136
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,060
Oh gosh.

2137
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,280
Welcome back, Marukami!

2138
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:28,740
Back!

2139
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:30,880
Locked?

2140
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:37,730
I got jumpscared and it was locked.

2141
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:40,650
I think the guy's not chasing after me anymore though.

2142
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:45,050
Whoa, this is a very narrow hallway.

2143
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:49,490
Specimens?

2144
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:51,010
What is this?

2145
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:53,210
Oh, cool!

2146
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:03,090
Maybe I should've explored it.

2147
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:06,150
AHHHH!

2148
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,900
Oh my god, I forgot what it was.

2149
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:13,500
AHHHH!

2150
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,420
Oh god, I'm gonna die!

2151
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:14,880
I'm gonna die!

2152
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:15,340
I'm gonna die!

2153
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,560
Oh no no no no no no no.

2154
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,280
Please please please please.

2155
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:23,360
Not like this, not like this, not like this, not like this, not like this, not like this, not like this!

2156
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,160
Ah.

2157
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:25,520
Ah.

2158
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:26,200
Ah.

2159
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:26,720
Ah.

2160
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:38,780
She's cheating.

2161
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:39,440
She's cheating.

2162
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,020
She's cheating.

2163
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:40,620
She's cheating.

2164
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,140
She's cheating.

2165
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:44,020
I mean if I was a ghost I would die... I mean I am a ghost, but...

2166
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:46,220
If I could, I wooooood!

2167
01:49:52,830 --> 01:49:56,170
Miss Specimen, I'm on your siiiiide!

2168
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,150
Please!

2169
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,480
Aren't you already dead?

2170
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:22,280
It's not fair, games never recognize my deadness.

2171
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:26,680
They always assume that the person playing is alive!

2172
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:30,600
They always assume!

2173
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,060
And you know what assuming does?

2174
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,940
If I could, I would!

2175
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,020
It's true!

2176
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,260
If I could, I would!

2177
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:55,520
Yeah, assuming turns you into an ass.

2178
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:01,720
You become a butt.

2179
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:08,150
Let's go to the right.

2180
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:09,830
Like a donkey.

2181
01:51:11,190 --> 01:51:12,890
Oh, this one's new.

2182
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:17,910
Actually, it doesn't even give me the option to go to the other side.

2183
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:20,770
Oh no, this is the long one!

2184
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:21,110
Just kidding.

2185
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,470
Thanks for the page.

2186
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:30,150
I see that as a win- Ass a win-win.

2187
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:32,830
Donkey.

2188
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:34,970
Doesn't that mean I get a Dragon GF?

2189
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:39,930
Put some respect on that title.

2190
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:41,170
It's a dragon wife!

2191
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:43,570
He has kids with her!

2192
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:49,050
Donkey has children with the dragon!

2193
01:52:03,410 --> 01:52:04,530
Good for him.

2194
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:09,810
Shrek 5 hype.

2195
01:52:10,030 --> 01:52:11,670
Oh yeah, let's go check this out now.

2196
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,880
Oh, why did I check it out?

2197
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,900
Why did I check it out?

2198
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,860
Why did I check it out?

2199
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,460
I made it!

2200
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:29,120
You just keep on going, don't you?

2201
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,900
Well, the next door has been fixed up for you.

2202
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,300
So enjoy, and keep moving on.

2203
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:35,500
You little...

2204
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,920
Fleshy, I want.

2205
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:38,480
That's not me at all!

2206
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,280
I mean, I'm not fleshy.

2207
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,120
I don't know the last time I've had flesh.

2208
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,080
Spooky.

2209
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:49,160
We're halfway there!

2210
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:50,180
Cheese!

2211
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,300
First pumpkin, then cheese.

2212
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:00,820
Dang.

2213
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,360
Are you sure it's out of order?

2214
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:12,740
Wait, so we're not going down anymore?

2215
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:17,960
I can't believe we're halfway there, you guys.

2216
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:26,630
Oh, just kidding.

2217
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:30,550
Uh-oh, now some doors are fake?

2218
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:34,750
I just realized that I never had a mentor figure.

2219
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:37,110
Trial or leaving home scene.

2220
01:53:37,330 --> 01:53:40,990
That means the story isn't following the archetypes to make me a traditional hero.

2221
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:42,510
Which means I can be killed off.

2222
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:44,890
Well, it was nice for at least...

2223
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:46,210
Oh, a little while at least.

2224
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:50,850
Room 51!

2225
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:54,550
52!

2226
01:53:58,230 --> 01:53:59,510
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2227
01:54:02,370 --> 01:54:03,230
Can I go back?

2228
01:54:03,370 --> 01:54:04,010
I can't!

2229
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:06,590
She's...

2230
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:07,710
She's...

2231
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:08,770
She's cheating!

2232
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:14,410
No, no, no, no, no.

2233
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,180
No, no!

2234
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:21,100
Turn off...

2235
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:21,640
Oh, no.

2236
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:22,560
Wait a second.

2237
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,460
Oh, they can come through.

2238
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:27,320
Even though the room is really skinny, they can still come through?

2239
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:30,780
Oh, yep.

2240
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:34,040
No way.

2241
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,240
Cannot release twice.

2242
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:38,380
Exit through express.

2243
01:54:44,890 --> 01:54:46,340
Express turn on!

2244
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:48,620
Yippee!

2245
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:57,940
Jeez game!

2246
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:02,900
Jeez game!

2247
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:05,460
Right!

2248
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:06,500
Straight!

2249
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:08,720
Left!

2250
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:10,060
Oh.

2251
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,260
Right.

2252
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:12,620
Straight.

2253
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:13,340
Am I cheating?

2254
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:14,440
What?

2255
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:15,580
Straight.

2256
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:17,980
Right.

2257
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:19,540
Straight.

2258
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:20,820
Right.

2259
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:23,820
Left.

2260
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:26,420
Right.

2261
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,300
Straight.

2262
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:29,920
Right.

2263
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:30,780
Straight.

2264
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:33,120
Oh,

2265
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,740
come on.

2266
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,500
Ugh.

2267
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:47,400
These guys are such a pain in my side.

2268
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,480
What's that music?

2269
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:50,920
Uh-oh.

2270
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,020
This is a new room.

2271
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:55,100
Why do I hear like a music box?

2272
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,240
Oh, gosh.

2273
01:55:57,540 --> 01:55:58,660
There's so much here!

2274
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,060
Unfair.

2275
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:02,760
Unfair.

2276
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:03,840
Unfair.

2277
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:05,420
The goopy!

2278
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:06,940
These guys are everywhere.

2279
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:16,690
I hear.

2280
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:17,390
I hear.

2281
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:23,420
Well, that's a new one.

2282
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2283
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:26,540
Let's get out of here.

2284
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:27,880
Skedaddleaddle.

2285
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,300
This place needs a maid!

2286
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:41,220
I would never keep my mansion looking so horrible.

2287
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:49,850
You guys are so annoying.

2288
01:56:49,850 --> 01:56:50,450
Do you guys hear the music?

2289
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:55,430
I can't tell if it's ambience or...

2290
01:56:57,850 --> 01:56:58,410
something.

2291
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:00,450
What was that?

2292
01:57:01,870 --> 01:57:02,430
Purple!

2293
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:05,430
Oh, this room is really purple.

2294
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,870
Wowee.

2295
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:15,160
Scream lagged the stream?

2296
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:17,740
There's lag.

2297
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:19,640
I wonder if maybe it's the YouTube side.

2298
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:21,600
The Grimace Room?

2299
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:23,720
Okay, last time...

2300
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:25,420
I don't remember.

2301
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:27,220
Let's go this way.

2302
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:29,760
Oh, shoot.

2303
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:34,970
Why does this keep happening to me?

2304
01:57:36,410 --> 01:57:37,330
Is he gonna get me?

2305
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:37,830
Is he gonna get me?

2306
01:57:38,850 --> 01:57:39,330
Okay.

2307
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:43,650
I'm reading the note.

2308
01:57:46,870 --> 01:57:47,350
No!

2309
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:50,450
No!

2310
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:53,990
Must I get caught once?

2311
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:58,010
Oh, this was such a surprise that there would be another entry.

2312
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:59,250
Another actual entry.

2313
01:58:01,390 --> 01:58:02,870
Read it with feeling.

2314
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:05,910
Oh, this was such a surprise.

2315
01:58:06,490 --> 01:58:08,950
Oh, this was such a surprise.

2316
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:10,690
Okay, let's just go get got.

2317
01:58:12,070 --> 01:58:13,590
You guys are gonna scream.

2318
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:14,590
Ready?

2319
01:58:15,070 --> 01:58:15,630
Screeee...

2320
01:58:16,530 --> 01:58:17,090
Oh.

2321
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:26,250
You guys are going to scream.

2322
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:27,990
Screeeeam!

2323
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:42,550
I actually don't mind that room though now because it's guaranteed basically to be safe.

2324
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:47,510
It's just a guy that comes after me.

2325
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:52,930
Suspiciously long hallway.

2326
01:58:55,770 --> 01:58:56,970
That got me.

2327
01:58:58,630 --> 01:58:59,070
Oh!

2328
01:58:59,070 --> 01:59:00,270
Oh, it's this guy.

2329
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:00,870
Open.

2330
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:21,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2331
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:22,720
Open, open.

2332
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,640
Oh gosh, I hate these rooms with him.

2333
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:27,900
They're really hard.

2334
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:31,480
These ones are not so bad.

2335
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:33,640
Wait, weren't we just down there below?

2336
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:34,820
That's so funny.

2337
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,720
Oh, now we're back down here below.

2338
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,200
He's just so goofy.

2339
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:45,300
Yeah, he doesn't really scare me.

2340
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:45,980
Oh gosh.

2341
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:56,380
He's just frustrating to deal with because he's one of those types of enemies.

2342
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:59,140
Every horror game has this enemy.

2343
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,260
Ooh, the music's getting freaky though.

2344
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:04,400
He's very fast.

2345
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:05,060
He is!

2346
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:05,580
He is.

2347
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:07,980
You have to be really on your toes with this guy.

2348
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:09,780
Whoa!

2349
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:13,960
Whoa.

2350
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:18,760
Oh, I'm in...

2351
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,620
I'm a peasant man.

2352
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:23,640
Whoa, what is this?

2353
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:26,320
For a while, I thought I had really escaped this place.

2354
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:30,540
But despite the trees and flora, I think this is actually just another room I did.

2355
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,020
Oh, I room.

2356
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:34,080
Oh, I did, however, find deer!

2357
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,020
So I might at least get to eat.

2358
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,680
They make some strange sounds though.

2359
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:44,140
What did they say about these guys?

2360
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:45,980
Do I just have to run from them?

2361
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:46,900
Oh gosh.

2362
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:50,080
Run from the deer?

2363
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:51,840
The violent deer?

2364
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:57,070
I left the deer behind.

2365
02:00:58,650 --> 02:00:59,530
Can I take that?

2366
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:03,790
Extra dimensionally choppy.

2367
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:04,370
What do I do?

2368
02:01:06,990 --> 02:01:08,150
Oh, I chopped down the door.

2369
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:11,070
Oh.

2370
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:19,340
Oh my god.

2371
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:19,760
Oh my god.

2372
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:20,460
Ow!

2373
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:26,240
Whoa.

2374
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:26,740
Freaky.

2375
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,260
Oh, another place with like rooms and stuff.

2376
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:31,640
Okay.

2377
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:37,380
Any lore?

2378
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:49,170
This one?

2379
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:50,350
Locked.

2380
02:01:57,010 --> 02:01:58,350
Oh, I got a key.

2381
02:01:58,450 --> 02:01:59,390
I didn't even notice it before.

2382
02:01:59,550 --> 02:02:00,750
Unless it wasn't there before.

2383
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:01,410
I don't know.

2384
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:05,290
This next specimen is dangerous.

2385
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:07,850
Yeah, I don't like him.

2386
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:14,140
Oh god.

2387
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:16,620
Okay.

2388
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:18,440
Yes, deer!

2389
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:20,800
No, deer!

2390
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,340
What are you saying?

2391
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,180
I'm cutting you off.

2392
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:26,820
You're too slow.

2393
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:27,440
Oh shit.

2394
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:32,700
Oh my god.

2395
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:33,820
Out of my way, please.

2396
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:36,740
Oh god.

2397
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:41,780
Join us.

2398
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,020
Cutting you off, man.

2399
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,260
I'm not listening.

2400
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:50,240
I don't want anything to do with your weird cult, okay?

2401
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,540
My what?

2402
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,340
My what?

2403
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:56,740
What'd you say?

2404
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,360
You have to speak up!

2405
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:07,240
There should be a mod that like replaces what they say with that song.

2406
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:13,880
Anyway.

2407
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:16,800
The deer club.

2408
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:18,960
Oh, he wants to give hugs.

2409
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:21,740
I think of, um...

2410
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:26,920
The deer that are in Nara that like get aggressive with you when you try to feed them.

2411
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:33,420
Shika no ko no ko no ko koshita anta.

2412
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,600
Shika no ko no ko no ko koshita...

2413
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,380
Do I still have my axe?

2414
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:36,680
I do!

2415
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:39,620
Very nice.

2416
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:52,510
I was like...

2417
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:53,450
Okay.

2418
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:55,950
Alrighty.

2419
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:00,390
Okay.

2420
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:03,150
I haven't started any new anime this season.

2421
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:07,530
Um...

2422
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:11,070
But it seems like there's a lot of really great stuff this season.

2423
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:11,990
So...

2424
02:04:12,690 --> 02:04:14,590
I should get on it.

2425
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:17,350
It's just been kind of too...

2426
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,290
Too busy.

2427
02:04:21,490 --> 02:04:25,390
I think I won't be able to really watch too much until like probably...

2428
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:27,390
I don't know.

2429
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:33,610
I don't want to wait until the season's over but...

2430
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:34,470
Cause then...

2431
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:37,810
You know it's always harder to get motivated to watch something once it's over.

2432
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,850
Like it's easier to watch it week by week.

2433
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:41,730
Oh shoot.

2434
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:43,990
I was like, am I slow or what?

2435
02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:48,090
No more goop!

2436
02:04:48,370 --> 02:04:49,330
Say it with me!

2437
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:51,290
No more goop!

2438
02:04:51,490 --> 02:04:53,190
No more goop!

2439
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:55,130
Oh my god.

2440
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:06,420
No more goop!

2441
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:08,640
Oh shoot.

2442
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:10,060
I have to go this way.

2443
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:13,080
Hit the goop?

2444
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:14,420
I can't.

2445
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:18,040
Unless I can...

2446
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:26,820
Oh my gosh.

2447
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:28,440
There's even more goop!

2448
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:35,100
Non-stop goop!

2449
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:36,760
I think the goop is tasty.

2450
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:43,120
It really looks like it would taste like a green Gatorade or you know the yellow Gatorades.

2451
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:47,040
Pick one.

2452
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:49,380
I don't like this.

2453
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:53,960
I feel like one is going to lead to room 600 and one isn't.

2454
02:05:58,750 --> 02:06:01,790
One is going to lead to a save point and one is not.

2455
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:15,520
A tiger by the toe.

2456
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:17,160
Whippy hollers let him go.

2457
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:23,120
My mom said to pick the very best one and you are it.

2458
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:31,780
Pillar.

2459
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:33,780
Make like a tree and die.

2460
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:35,060
Coming this fall.

2461
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,180
Keep that blood pumping.

2462
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:43,500
We're going down down and we're running around.

2463
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:46,680
Sugar word don't going down screaming.

2464
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:50,040
I'll be your number one with a mullet.

2465
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:53,540
Mother God complex cock it and pull it.

2466
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:04,600
Starting off very exciting.

2467
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:07,460
Endless hallway.

2468
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:24,390
Another endless hallway.

2469
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:31,040
Mint out boy.

2470
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,320
Good night Mint.

2471
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:34,800
Good night.

2472
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:36,660
Did you guys have a good weekend?

2473
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:42,380
Did you guys have fun?

2474
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,340
Oh I still have my axe even.

2475
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:47,280
That's exciting.

2476
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:54,200
I like miserable weekend next to awesome weekend.

2477
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:55,880
Meh.

2478
02:07:56,120 --> 02:07:57,320
It ended so so.

2479
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:03,720
Before you know it it'll be the weekend.

2480
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:05,120
Again?

2481
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:13,640
Again?

2482
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:23,160
Oh.

2483
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:25,520
Day two.

2484
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:26,980
Food supply depleted.

2485
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:28,420
Water supply at 30%.

2486
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:29,820
Mental health deteriorating.

2487
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,280
Leaving notes behind to help others and mark where I've been.

2488
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:35,520
If you were hired to scare visitors in this mansion.

2489
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:36,820
How would I do it?

2490
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:57,060
You know what they say.

2491
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:58,340
Just be yourself.

2492
02:08:58,940 --> 02:08:59,240
Oh.

2493
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:06,560
I feel like I'm in a different game.

2494
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:15,640
What do they use to lock the doors in here?

2495
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:17,020
Spookies.

2496
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:17,460
Haha.

2497
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,080
Woah.

2498
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:23,560
This whole place is somehow even worse than the new GL labs.

2499
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:28,800
Although it seems to have been constructed with a much larger budget than the new lab.

2500
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,200
Nothing works quite right.

2501
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,580
I can see why it was abandoned so quickly.

2502
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:36,080
I wonder if there really is anything here worth salvaging.

2503
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:37,600
Beep boop.

2504
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:40,540
Woah.

2505
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:41,580
We have some light.

2506
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:46,440
Oh.

2507
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:47,360
Okay.

2508
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:50,400
Dead space time.

2509
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:50,780
Yeah.

2510
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:51,180
Right.

2511
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:53,460
GL labs.

2512
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:58,240
Let me guess.

2513
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:01,560
Like the power only works for a certain amount of time or something crazy.

2514
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:08,960
Oh.

2515
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:09,860
Oh no.

2516
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:10,320
I knew it.

2517
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:14,330
No.

2518
02:10:14,490 --> 02:10:15,730
Why did I have to call it?

2519
02:10:17,410 --> 02:10:18,150
Oh my god.

2520
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:19,930
Huh.

2521
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:24,670
I don't like this.

2522
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:25,210
I don't like this.

2523
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:26,170
I don't like this.

2524
02:10:26,210 --> 02:10:26,710
I don't like this.

2525
02:10:27,530 --> 02:10:28,470
I don't like this.

2526
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:28,790
I don't like this.

2527
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:29,450
This is...

2528
02:10:29,450 --> 02:10:30,570
What is that?

2529
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:40,380
How many rooms am I getting through here?

2530
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:42,400
615?

2531
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:43,560
Oh.

2532
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:44,980
6...

2533
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:49,600
Spooky just said that there were things we needed to salvage from this place.

2534
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:54,260
I'm starting to worry that a loose specimen may be included in the list of things for us to retrieve.

2535
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,620
The power just shut off again.

2536
02:10:55,900 --> 02:10:57,200
Is everything broken in here?

2537
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:03,300
My room didn't...

2538
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:04,940
My room number didn't change at all.

2539
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:08,020
Or did it?

2540
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:09,080
I don't think it did though.

2541
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:10,060
Oh.

2542
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:10,440
There's nothing.

2543
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:12,160
I don't know what to do.

2544
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:12,900
I can't think well.

2545
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:13,480
I feel strange.

2546
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:14,420
I'm hiding from that thing.

2547
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:16,640
I feel like something is growing on my skin.

2548
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:20,980
I can't seem to tear it off fast enough and I'm losing a lot of blood.

2549
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:24,240
What is going on?

2550
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:24,780
What is going on here?

2551
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:30,500
Uh oh.

2552
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:33,780
You have to keep it close.

2553
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:34,700
Close.

2554
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:36,680
It becomes something else when it gets too far away.

2555
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:37,900
Something I can't outrun.

2556
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:44,320
Keep it close?

2557
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:45,360
Oh my god.

2558
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:45,660
Ah!

2559
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:49,720
What the hell is that?

2560
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:51,500
Oh my god.

2561
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:54,680
Wait.

2562
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:55,300
Keep it close.

2563
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:56,200
What the?

2564
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:57,180
What the?

2565
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:57,520
Oh!

2566
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:58,160
That thing!

2567
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:58,580
Oh!

2568
02:11:59,300 --> 02:11:59,640
I don't know what to do.

2569
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:00,700
I don't know what to do.

2570
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:01,060
AHH!

2571
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:02,860
I'm gonna die.

2572
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:03,340
I'm gonna die.

2573
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:03,860
I'm gonna die.

2574
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:04,340
I'm gonna die.

2575
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:05,340
I'm gonna die.

2576
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:05,880
I'm gonna die.

2577
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:06,180
I'm gonna die.

2578
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:06,800
Oh my god.

2579
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:08,040
I'm gonna die?

2580
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:08,640
No!

2581
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:09,600
No!

2582
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:14,130
Oh, it's on me.

2583
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:17,470
We're gaining health.

2584
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:24,980
I think I can't run.

2585
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:26,920
I think I have to walk.

2586
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:28,680
Keep it close.

2587
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:29,640
Keep it close.

2588
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:30,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2589
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:31,680
Come here, baby.

2590
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:33,080
Come here, baby girl.

2591
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:34,400
Bro, hey.

2592
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:35,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2593
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:36,720
Come on.

2594
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:37,380
Okay, okay.

2595
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:38,980
How did I live?

2596
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:40,200
Oh my god.

2597
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:41,200
Oh no, no!

2598
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:43,280
I was walking!

2599
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:46,700
You're just too slow!

2600
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:52,170
We're walking.

2601
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:54,950
I'm walking too fast apparently.

2602
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,260
When it gets too far away, he turns into a bug monster.

2603
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:14,180
Excuse me!

2604
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:16,080
Come on!

2605
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,880
Come on, come on, come on!

2606
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:34,660
It reminds me of something from Stranger Things.

2607
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:38,120
Yeah, I'm taking my pet alien for a walk.

2608
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:42,020
Love that movie Teeth.

2609
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:46,920
Oh, nice long hallway for us to travel down.

2610
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:48,660
You and me, buddy.

2611
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:50,240
Yep.

2612
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:52,100
Oh, I love you.

2613
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:52,920
Yeah.

2614
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:55,340
Became like a little head guy.

2615
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:58,120
It was first a giant head, then became a hugger.

2616
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:01,380
Just like a cat.

2617
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:01,880
Yeah.

2618
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:03,740
Just like a cat.

2619
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:04,820
Oh my god.

2620
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:05,200
Okay.

2621
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:07,280
Oh my god.

2622
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:07,820
Really?

2623
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:08,940
Not the time toast.

2624
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:12,380
Yeah.

2625
02:14:13,620 --> 02:14:14,060
Okay.

2626
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:15,260
I don't mind this one so much.

2627
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:22,900
It just makes it hard for us to, you know, for us to speed through these rooms, but that's okay.

2628
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:26,140
There's always time for toast.

2629
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:32,260
It makes it a little hard for us to go through these rooms really quickly, but that's okay.

2630
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:34,360
Friend-shaped.

2631
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:39,520
You guys kept mentioning that all these ghosts or all these monsters and stuff just want to hug.

2632
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:44,360
And this is the first time I've really felt invited, you know?

2633
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:49,700
This is the first time I've ever felt invited.

2634
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:58,080
The monster that was inspired by the movie The Thing, which also inspired the very known game Among Us.

2635
02:14:58,220 --> 02:14:59,560
Oh wait, this monster.

2636
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:02,220
Oh, this monster was inspired by The Thing.

2637
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:02,880
I can see it.

2638
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:04,440
I love that movie.

2639
02:15:06,020 --> 02:15:07,920
Which I did know inspired Among Us.

2640
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,340
Oh, we're here!

2641
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:14,160
Nine?

2642
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:16,160
No.

2643
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:21,360
No?

2644
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:37,940
To take the den?

2645
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:47,780
What does that mean?

2646
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:52,900
Oh, that's our deer.

2647
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:55,240
Is this the guy?

2648
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:55,520
Yeah!

2649
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:12,420
245!

2650
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:14,900
That was almost me.

2651
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:15,600
Not gonna lie.

2652
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:18,160
Where are we taking them?

2653
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:18,980
I don't know.

2654
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:22,080
This one has zero deaths.

2655
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:24,060
Zero fatalities, I mean.

2656
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:28,580
I'm afraid of no ghost.

2657
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:31,820
Can I change the house layout now?

2658
02:16:38,470 --> 02:16:39,070
Cool.

2659
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:44,760
Take the dead to take the dead to...

2660
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,240
What's that sound?

2661
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,080
Sounds kinda wet.

2662
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:51,120
Like a...

2663
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:53,080
Sounds like that.

2664
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:57,300
It would be kind of embarrassing to be the first kill.

2665
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:58,120
I know, right?

2666
02:16:58,420 --> 02:16:58,920
Oh gosh.

2667
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:01,300
It's really rumbly.

2668
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:03,480
Someone's hungry!

2669
02:17:13,290 --> 02:17:14,710
Not me though?

2670
02:17:14,830 --> 02:17:15,230
You sure?

2671
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:17,490
Virgil?

2672
02:17:17,810 --> 02:17:18,730
Did you eat?

2673
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:21,710
Long hallway.

2674
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:23,310
Oh goodness.

2675
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:26,750
Ah!

2676
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:27,890
Oh my gosh!

2677
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:28,190
No!

2678
02:17:29,970 --> 02:17:30,570
Please!

2679
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:41,450
Ben...

2680
02:17:46,010 --> 02:17:48,130
I wonder what the line of...

2681
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:49,230
He's like...

2682
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:52,650
He's pointing at me like...

2683
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:55,810
When do I get my hands on you?

2684
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:59,030
When do I get my hands on you?

2685
02:17:59,030 --> 02:17:59,410
Ouch!

2686
02:17:59,550 --> 02:17:59,990
Oh gosh!

2687
02:17:59,990 --> 02:18:01,010
Ah!

2688
02:18:01,290 --> 02:18:01,650
Ben!

2689
02:18:01,950 --> 02:18:03,070
I'm sorry, man.

2690
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:04,970
Let's start over.

2691
02:18:05,370 --> 02:18:06,370
Let's start over.

2692
02:18:06,690 --> 02:18:07,230
We're cool.

2693
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:08,550
We're chill.

2694
02:18:15,530 --> 02:18:16,270
We're cool.

2695
02:18:16,390 --> 02:18:16,870
We're chill.

2696
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:26,220
Oh gosh.

2697
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:28,020
That guy went the wrong way.

2698
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:30,760
Good old Ben.

2699
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:31,320
Really?

2700
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:33,160
I don't know.

2701
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:35,160
That's a bit of a...

2702
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:40,100
I don't know if good is the right...

2703
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:40,560
Oh my gosh.

2704
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:46,640
We get a little bit of a theremin action.

2705
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:47,180
Or something.

2706
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:51,100
I wanna learn the theremin so bad.

2707
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:54,060
If I did a theremin learning stream, would you guys listen?

2708
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:03,230
Yeah?

2709
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:06,490
We can make some spooky Halloween music or something.

2710
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:10,010
Ben.

2711
02:19:11,590 --> 02:19:12,450
Oh my god.

2712
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:24,680
That was so close.

2713
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:25,800
Oh my goodness.

2714
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:28,000
Hell yes, theremin stream.

2715
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:35,140
I can actually do it with my mouth.

2716
02:19:39,340 --> 02:19:40,400
Can you axe him?

2717
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:41,380
Oh my god.

2718
02:19:49,030 --> 02:19:50,020
Ben drowned!

2719
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:56,960
Yeah!

2720
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:59,180
You can hit the puppet with the axe.

2721
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:00,300
Yeah!

2722
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:05,980
Yeah, take that.

2723
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:06,840
Bozo.

2724
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:11,040
Sorry if your name is Ben.

2725
02:20:15,330 --> 02:20:16,270
Oh he's gone.

2726
02:20:16,930 --> 02:20:17,590
Yippee!

2727
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:17,630
Yippee!

2728
02:20:22,450 --> 02:20:23,090
Pheromone.

2729
02:20:23,470 --> 02:20:24,110
Stream.

2730
02:20:25,330 --> 02:20:26,610
Like, scents?

2731
02:20:31,810 --> 02:20:32,450
Green.

2732
02:20:33,970 --> 02:20:35,710
It ain't easy being green.

2733
02:20:41,950 --> 02:20:42,590
Okay.

2734
02:20:43,390 --> 02:20:45,050
Stop killing Bennett's son.

2735
02:20:45,930 --> 02:20:47,530
He needs to stop hurting me.

2736
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:50,870
I'm so glad that this game eventually has health recover.

2737
02:20:51,190 --> 02:20:53,090
And like a pretty quick pace too.

2738
02:20:53,390 --> 02:20:54,270
It's very forgiving.

2739
02:20:55,690 --> 02:20:57,490
This room again.

2740
02:20:59,250 --> 02:20:59,650
Left!

2741
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:01,970
Straight!

2742
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:03,910
Right.

2743
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:06,550
Straight!

2744
02:21:07,770 --> 02:21:08,570
Right.

2745
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:11,590
Left.

2746
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:14,410
Right.

2747
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:16,370
Right.

2748
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:19,170
Left.

2749
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:19,670
Right.

2750
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:21,950
Right.

2751
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:24,170
Oh shoot.

2752
02:21:24,330 --> 02:21:25,390
Wait, it was right?

2753
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:26,710
Right.

2754
02:21:26,810 --> 02:21:28,090
Left.

2755
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:30,090
And straight.

2756
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:31,750
Right.

2757
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:33,190
Right.

2758
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:34,610
Left.

2759
02:21:35,290 --> 02:21:36,710
And left.

2760
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:41,250
The silliest march walk ever.

2761
02:21:42,150 --> 02:21:47,570
The silliest march walk ever.

2762
02:21:47,570 --> 02:21:49,170
Hopping on one foot at one point.

2763
02:21:51,290 --> 02:21:52,390
Doing splits.

2764
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:53,310
Yeah, exactly.

2765
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:04,350
I like how they're...

2766
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:06,510
I'm so curious about the lore.

2767
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:07,810
For this game.

2768
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:08,510
I want more.

2769
02:22:08,830 --> 02:22:10,130
I want more lore.

2770
02:22:14,970 --> 02:22:16,290
Give me more notes.

2771
02:22:16,570 --> 02:22:18,550
Give me more floating skull heads.

2772
02:22:21,250 --> 02:22:22,570
Give me more floating skull heads.

2773
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:25,350
Give me more floating skull heads.

2774
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:25,670
DLC.

2775
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:27,470
Is that the hospital one?

2776
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:38,020
There's two DLC focused on a lore?

2777
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:39,420
There's two DLC focused on a lore?

2778
02:22:44,430 --> 02:22:47,550
What a suspiciously long way.

2779
02:22:47,550 --> 02:22:47,810
What a suspiciously long way.

2780
02:22:50,330 --> 02:22:51,870
Oh and the dollhouse.

2781
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:54,790
Oh and the dollhouse.

2782
02:22:54,790 --> 02:22:58,350
The dollhouse.

2783
02:23:00,370 --> 02:23:01,130
Locked.

2784
02:23:02,310 --> 02:23:02,450
Okay.

2785
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:04,390
Rude.

2786
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:13,100
I can't believe they just have random doors that are locked like that.

2787
02:23:17,390 --> 02:23:18,190
I can't believe they just have random doors that are locked like that.

2788
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:18,430
Oh shit.

2789
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:20,710
No, no, no.

2790
02:23:20,770 --> 02:23:21,690
This is the girl, isn't it?

2791
02:23:21,770 --> 02:23:22,170
No!

2792
02:23:24,470 --> 02:23:25,270
Ice cream!

2793
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:28,850
Do... do...

2794
02:23:28,850 --> 02:23:30,170
Oh, it's the girl.

2795
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:30,610
It's the girl.

2796
02:23:31,390 --> 02:23:32,190
No, no.

2797
02:23:32,850 --> 02:23:34,090
No, girl, run away.

2798
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:35,570
Run away from the girl.

2799
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:36,450
Run away from girl.

2800
02:23:36,770 --> 02:23:37,370
Run away from girl.

2801
02:23:39,550 --> 02:23:42,190
She's like, Don't you want a ghost girlfriend?

2802
02:23:42,430 --> 02:23:43,430
She's a desperate woman.

2803
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,910
I... I mean...

2804
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:47,730
I

2805
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:52,040
don't know what I want anymore.

2806
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:54,580
I'm... I'm not ready for combat.

2807
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:57,140
I'm... I'm not ready for combat.

2808
02:23:57,140 --> 02:23:57,280
Please.

2809
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:00,280
Oh my god.

2810
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:01,120
The music is so loud.

2811
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:02,540
Feels like she's right behind me.

2812
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:04,600
Feels like she's breathing down my neck.

2813
02:24:08,360 --> 02:24:09,720
Girls have good ears!

2814
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:15,900
Minto running away from a girl?

2815
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:16,760
That's a first.

2816
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:21,580
She's just intimidated.

2817
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:27,580
She's like, Lovely ghost girl.

2818
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:30,640
Let's be besties.

2819
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:31,400
And I'm like, Hey, girly.

2820
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:34,400
I don't know you.

2821
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:36,620
Oh my god.

2822
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:36,960
No way.

2823
02:24:36,980 --> 02:24:37,520
She's so fast.

2824
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:38,180
Oh my god.

2825
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:41,560
She's so fast.

2826
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:48,910
Is it because she can go through walls?

2827
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:49,510
Is it because she can go through walls?

2828
02:24:51,250 --> 02:24:52,670
I'm like letting my...

2829
02:24:52,670 --> 02:24:54,850
I'm like using every inch of my...

2830
02:24:54,850 --> 02:24:55,730
Oh my gosh.

2831
02:24:56,130 --> 02:24:56,850
Of my...

2832
02:24:58,290 --> 02:24:58,650
Stamina.

2833
02:25:01,610 --> 02:25:03,210
When I get it back, I use it.

2834
02:25:06,430 --> 02:25:07,490
She's gonna get ya.

2835
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:08,250
No.

2836
02:25:09,630 --> 02:25:10,610
Oh, we made it.

2837
02:25:12,490 --> 02:25:13,550
Good job, guys.

2838
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:16,210
We're at...

2839
02:25:16,210 --> 02:25:16,530
Oh my gosh.

2840
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:17,970
We're at 669.

2841
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:19,970
Nice.

2842
02:25:24,350 --> 02:25:24,850
Six...

2843
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:27,210
Mr. Brain.

2844
02:25:27,930 --> 02:25:28,930
We meet again.

2845
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:31,970
The pinky and the brain.

2846
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:32,930
And Larry.

2847
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:35,890
The pinky and the brain.

2848
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:36,330
And Larry.

2849
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:38,590
One is a genius.

2850
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:40,130
The other's insane.

2851
02:25:40,470 --> 02:25:41,170
And there's Larry.

2852
02:25:43,290 --> 02:25:45,050
They're laboratory mice.

2853
02:25:48,310 --> 02:25:49,970
I don't know what the rest is.

2854
02:25:52,410 --> 02:25:54,130
Do you guys remember that episode?

2855
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:56,250
There's an episode.

2856
02:25:56,790 --> 02:25:58,330
Of pinky and the brain.

2857
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:01,130
Yeah, I didn't...

2858
02:26:02,550 --> 02:26:03,570
What had happened was...

2859
02:26:04,990 --> 02:26:05,790
The place...

2860
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:07,710
I think Warner Brothers had the show or whatever.

2861
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:11,130
And they were like, Hey, you should add another mouse.

2862
02:26:12,450 --> 02:26:14,210
They were like, No, it's pinky and the brain.

2863
02:26:14,330 --> 02:26:15,390
You don't need a third mouse.

2864
02:26:15,590 --> 02:26:18,330
And they're like, No, add a third mouse to your show.

2865
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:19,670
They're like, okay.

2866
02:26:20,290 --> 02:26:20,930
And so...

2867
02:26:23,870 --> 02:26:27,290
Out of pure spite, they added the most annoying character.

2868
02:26:27,290 --> 02:26:31,570
And then had him ruin the iconic opening of the show.

2869
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:33,630
So...

2870
02:26:33,630 --> 02:26:34,150
Oh no.

2871
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:37,510
And so...

2872
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:38,390
It's just...

2873
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:41,870
It's like my favorite example of...

2874
02:26:41,870 --> 02:26:42,810
What's the word?

2875
02:26:43,110 --> 02:26:43,770
Compliance...

2876
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,070
Malicious compliance.

2877
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:50,970
And then...

2878
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:53,630
Nobody liked Larry enough to keep him in.

2879
02:26:55,050 --> 02:26:56,790
Wow, thank you for the pink!

2880
02:26:57,810 --> 02:26:58,650
Oh gosh.

2881
02:26:58,850 --> 02:26:59,330
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

2882
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:01,250
No!

2883
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:03,270
Oh no, no, no, no.

2884
02:27:03,290 --> 02:27:05,390
Oh gosh, please, please, please.

2885
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:08,790
At least there's only one of them, but...

2886
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:09,790
Oh my god, no.

2887
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:11,390
Please, please, please.

2888
02:27:14,210 --> 02:27:16,930
They were like, add a human and they put in...

2889
02:27:16,930 --> 02:27:18,210
Oh, okay.

2890
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:19,430
Hold on.

2891
02:27:20,650 --> 02:27:22,670
I can't read right now.

2892
02:27:23,070 --> 02:27:24,210
I'm getting attacked.

2893
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:26,370
On every angle.

2894
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:30,790
Hold on.

2895
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:34,130
Oh shoot.

2896
02:27:34,290 --> 02:27:35,150
There's two of them.

2897
02:27:36,890 --> 02:27:39,630
I love malicious compliance so much.

2898
02:27:39,650 --> 02:27:40,010
Me too.

2899
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:47,350
I'm getting gooped.

2900
02:27:47,350 --> 02:27:47,830
You guys.

2901
02:27:52,030 --> 02:27:52,710
Okay.

2902
02:27:55,310 --> 02:27:56,670
This guy...

2903
02:27:56,670 --> 02:27:58,950
This is a disgusting...

2904
02:27:58,950 --> 02:28:00,230
I think this is why I'm a ghost maid.

2905
02:28:00,410 --> 02:28:01,890
Because ghosts like this exist.

2906
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:10,190
What do you think the maid cafe looks like after days of ghostly patrons, right?

2907
02:28:11,570 --> 02:28:12,130
Awful.

2908
02:28:12,290 --> 02:28:14,070
These are the worst types of customers.

2909
02:28:15,070 --> 02:28:16,490
I think we're good now.

2910
02:28:18,030 --> 02:28:18,590
Yippee.

2911
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:24,640
Okay.

2912
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:26,860
Maybe just a few more?

2913
02:28:26,980 --> 02:28:28,120
I can't tell anymore.

2914
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:32,580
I don't know when the game is going to troll me.

2915
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:35,320
Oh, allow.

2916
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:42,600
Are ghost girls a type of slime girl?

2917
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:48,300
They might be a ghosty slime girl.

2918
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:57,380
I don't...

2919
02:28:57,380 --> 02:28:58,240
Hmm.

2920
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:01,720
You're making me question my existence.

2921
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:07,280
You're making me question things.

2922
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:12,820
But I only want them to goop if they're hot.

2923
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:20,180
And I'm trying not to be judgmental, but this guy is just overdoing it, you know?

2924
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:25,080
Yippee!

2925
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:25,500
Axe!

2926
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:26,320
Axe!

2927
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:27,120
Axe!

2928
02:29:54,370 --> 02:29:55,210
300 left.

2929
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:03,290
Ah!

2930
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:13,080
Smash!

2931
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:13,520
Boo!

2932
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:17,020
Thanks for the five giftin'!

2933
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:20,940
Uh-oh.

2934
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:24,720
What is that sound?

2935
02:30:26,120 --> 02:30:27,420
I'm just gonna keep going.

2936
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:29,500
What is that sound?

2937
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:32,360
Are ghost slimes extra goopy?

2938
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:35,920
Not extra.

2939
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,500
If they were extra goopy...

2940
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:41,180
You might want to consult your physician.

2941
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:44,740
You might want to go to the boo-spital.

2942
02:30:48,260 --> 02:30:49,500
Why is it...

2943
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:50,560
Oh!

2944
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:51,540
What the heck is this?

2945
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:54,380
Taste the beef!

2946
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:55,400
I'm in a...

2947
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:57,520
I'm in a liminal space?

2948
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:05,780
It's broken.

2949
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:09,480
Nasty.

2950
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:12,120
Read?

2951
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:12,460
Oh!

2952
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:14,600
Well, I broke my one rule today.

2953
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,880
The management doesn't give out actual lunch breaks, so I can't go anywhere.

2954
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:23,240
And they won't allow outside food here.

2955
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:25,720
I mean, they actually screamed at the last customer who did that.

2956
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:26,620
Anyway...

2957
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:28,060
I had a burger.

2958
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:28,780
It wasn't bad.

2959
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:29,380
And I don't feel sick.

2960
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:30,740
And I have something... something...

2961
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:34,380
I'm scared.

2962
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:36,900
Broken.

2963
02:31:37,220 --> 02:31:37,860
They won't let...

2964
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:40,300
Oh, but everybody can go into the ladies' room.

2965
02:31:40,340 --> 02:31:40,560
Oh, but everybody can go into the ladies' room.

2966
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:43,700
I was anxious getting a job here at first, but it seems like things are getting better.

2967
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:48,300
This chain is really expanding, which is a shock, because just last week I heard the company was going broke.

2968
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:50,780
Every day, more and more people show up to eat here.

2969
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:52,460
Something still sets me off about the place.

2970
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:53,260
And it's food, though.

2971
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:55,340
So I'm going to try to not eat anything from here.

2972
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:55,920
Oh!

2973
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:57,700
I'm reading them out of order.

2974
02:31:57,860 --> 02:31:58,220
Oopsie.

2975
02:31:59,260 --> 02:31:59,620
Locked.

2976
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:01,400
Oh.

2977
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:03,440
Today was a weird day.

2978
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:08,440
Men don't need to use restrooms!

2979
02:32:09,220 --> 02:32:12,300
Average number of orders continues to rise, as it has been.

2980
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:13,800
But I don't know about the number of people.

2981
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:17,360
Today I saw someone use the drive-thru and order a lot of food for one person.

2982
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:19,160
And then about ten minutes later, they were back!

2983
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:21,840
They ordered the same exact meals, and then they left again.

2984
02:32:22,060 --> 02:32:23,980
Then another ten minutes, they were back again.

2985
02:32:24,140 --> 02:32:26,260
Maybe they're just delivering food for a party or a hotel.

2986
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:27,940
But it worries me for some reason.

2987
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:30,940
100% beef.

2988
02:32:35,530 --> 02:32:37,190
And so now they ate it.

2989
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:38,430
We read that in the bathroom.

2990
02:32:41,830 --> 02:32:42,650
Fun rules!

2991
02:32:46,330 --> 02:32:47,450
100% beef.

2992
02:32:50,750 --> 02:32:51,930
I don't want to leave yet.

2993
02:32:51,970 --> 02:32:52,750
What's in here, though?

2994
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:54,550
We could go in.

2995
02:32:54,710 --> 02:32:55,530
Put your shoes away.

2996
02:32:56,170 --> 02:32:57,210
Wait, should we go in?

2997
02:32:57,450 --> 02:32:58,290
No screams.

2998
02:32:58,650 --> 02:32:59,410
Look out for snakes.

2999
02:33:00,370 --> 02:33:01,110
No alcohol.

3000
02:33:01,290 --> 02:33:01,790
No diving.

3001
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:02,330
No hiding.

3002
02:33:02,350 --> 02:33:03,170
We will find you.

3003
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:11,820
Look out for snake!

3004
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:18,610
Note on the floor?

3005
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:20,250
Oh!

3006
02:33:20,470 --> 02:33:21,270
This is strange.

3007
02:33:22,330 --> 02:33:24,110
I had a dream last night about this restaurant.

3008
02:33:24,290 --> 02:33:25,170
I know I was here.

3009
02:33:25,370 --> 02:33:28,070
But I also felt like I was in another place at the same time.

3010
02:33:28,270 --> 02:33:29,330
Everything looked so wrong.

3011
02:33:29,710 --> 02:33:32,870
Nothing was the right size and I kept hearing these strange animal noises.

3012
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:34,250
Almost like wailing.

3013
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:36,990
I guess I feel guilty for eating that burger the other day.

3014
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:38,710
Also today I saw that man again.

3015
02:33:38,890 --> 02:33:40,370
The one who kept ordering every ten minutes.

3016
02:33:40,970 --> 02:33:41,330
But...

3017
02:33:41,330 --> 02:33:42,030
Oh, oh.

3018
02:33:42,050 --> 02:33:43,870
This time he never even left the parking lot.

3019
02:33:43,970 --> 02:33:46,250
He just got his meal parked and then got back in line.

3020
02:33:46,470 --> 02:33:48,550
He must have done it at least eight times before he left.

3021
02:33:50,730 --> 02:33:51,510
I'm scared.

3022
02:33:51,690 --> 02:33:52,370
Should I go in?

3023
02:33:52,530 --> 02:33:53,170
I'm so scared.

3024
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:56,070
I'm scared.

3025
02:33:59,350 --> 02:34:00,190
I'm scared.

3026
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,590
It was fat man.

3027
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:07,820
Go in?

3028
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:14,640
Guys, if I die in here though, I think that's pretty bad.

3029
02:34:18,860 --> 02:34:19,380
Oh.

3030
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:21,620
Oh.

3031
02:34:25,130 --> 02:34:25,650
Oh.

3032
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:25,870
Oh.

3033
02:34:25,870 --> 02:34:26,210
Oh.

3034
02:34:27,530 --> 02:34:28,770
I don't think I'm crawling.

3035
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:29,590
Oh.

3036
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:30,270
Oh.

3037
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:34,520
Metal Gear Pro...

3038
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:36,180
Uh...

3039
02:34:36,180 --> 02:34:37,120
Uh...

3040
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:38,400
Hmm...

3041
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:40,020
Uh...

3042
02:34:49,130 --> 02:34:49,630
Oh!

3043
02:34:50,590 --> 02:34:51,090
Key.

3044
02:34:53,490 --> 02:34:55,770
Maybe I had to come in here for the key to leave.

3045
02:34:56,150 --> 02:34:56,650
Oh!

3046
02:34:57,630 --> 02:34:58,510
I did it!

3047
02:35:03,930 --> 02:35:05,070
But I got the key!

3048
02:35:07,490 --> 02:35:08,790
This is messed up.

3049
02:35:09,050 --> 02:35:10,050
I got the key!

3050
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:14,230
Um...

3051
02:35:14,710 --> 02:35:15,650
Is there another key?

3052
02:35:18,690 --> 02:35:19,310
Wrong door.

3053
02:35:19,970 --> 02:35:20,790
Is this the bathroom?

3054
02:35:21,810 --> 02:35:22,890
Oh no, that was broken.

3055
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:25,130
Uh...

3056
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:25,790
Oh, this room!

3057
02:35:27,730 --> 02:35:28,050
Oh...

3058
02:35:28,050 --> 02:35:28,450
Oh...

3059
02:35:28,450 --> 02:35:29,610
I don't like this at all.

3060
02:35:29,690 --> 02:35:30,610
I don't like this at all.

3061
02:35:30,670 --> 02:35:31,370
I don't like this at all.

3062
02:35:31,430 --> 02:35:32,350
I don't like this at all.

3063
02:35:32,390 --> 02:35:33,250
I don't like this at all.

3064
02:35:33,310 --> 02:35:33,870
I don't like...

3065
02:35:33,870 --> 02:35:34,850
I don't like this at all!

3066
02:35:37,850 --> 02:35:38,150
Um...

3067
02:35:38,150 --> 02:35:38,710
See?

3068
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:40,190
Oh my god.

3069
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:45,720
I'm just gonna run.

3070
02:35:53,130 --> 02:35:54,790
I don't understand this guy.

3071
02:35:55,330 --> 02:35:55,950
Oh my god!

3072
02:35:55,970 --> 02:35:56,450
Oh my god!

3073
02:35:56,490 --> 02:35:56,710
Oh my god!

3074
02:35:56,710 --> 02:35:57,010
Oh my god!

3075
02:35:57,150 --> 02:35:57,450
Wait!

3076
02:35:57,530 --> 02:35:57,670
Wait!

3077
02:35:57,750 --> 02:35:57,890
Wait!

3078
02:35:57,890 --> 02:35:58,110
Wait!

3079
02:35:58,110 --> 02:35:58,230
Wait!

3080
02:35:58,230 --> 02:35:58,290
Wait!

3081
02:35:58,410 --> 02:35:58,510
Wait!

3082
02:35:58,510 --> 02:35:58,610
Wait!

3083
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:05,980
Wait!

3084
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:08,020
Oh, I had to.

3085
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:09,560
Die it.

3086
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:09,840
Maybe?

3087
02:36:09,980 --> 02:36:10,480
Or...

3088
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:13,080
Is this part of the game?

3089
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:13,660
Oh no.

3090
02:36:14,460 --> 02:36:15,820
I don't have my axe anymore.

3091
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:16,740
Did I die?

3092
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:18,280
Is this...

3093
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:19,180
Is this...

3094
02:36:19,180 --> 02:36:20,780
Is this what happens when you die?

3095
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:22,280
Oh...

3096
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:24,660
Get beefed.

3097
02:36:24,660 --> 02:36:24,840
Oh!

3098
02:36:26,180 --> 02:36:26,700
Uh...

3099
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,160
Hello?

3100
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,060
Beef.

3101
02:36:37,260 --> 02:36:37,780
Oh!

3102
02:36:57,730 --> 02:36:58,770
It was an actual death!

3103
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:00,470
Oh!

3104
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:03,140
Oh!

3105
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:03,680
Oh!

3106
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:04,280
Oh, that's...

3107
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:05,840
Uh...

3108
02:37:16,460 --> 02:37:18,080
Oh, he hides doors!

3109
02:37:18,580 --> 02:37:18,740
Huh?

3110
02:37:21,300 --> 02:37:21,980
Ah!

3111
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:24,140
Blalala...

3112
02:37:24,140 --> 02:37:27,940
If I continue...

3113
02:37:31,290 --> 02:37:31,970
Oh!

3114
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:40,100
Honestly, impressive you made it that far without losing.

3115
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:40,660
Haha!

3116
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:42,500
From 700.

3117
02:37:53,870 --> 02:37:55,390
700 with no death system?

3118
02:37:55,470 --> 02:37:55,810
That's really good?

3119
02:37:55,990 --> 02:37:56,210
Really?

3120
02:37:57,130 --> 02:37:58,070
That's good, I guess.

3121
02:38:00,890 --> 02:38:01,990
Save more often?

3122
02:38:02,110 --> 02:38:03,090
What are you talking about?

3123
02:38:03,210 --> 02:38:04,830
You can only save at the checkpoint!

3124
02:38:09,450 --> 02:38:11,830
You can only save at the checkpoint.

3125
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:17,390
Oh!

3126
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:18,750
There's even more here now.

3127
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:20,430
This guy.

3128
02:38:20,670 --> 02:38:20,810
Oh!

3129
02:38:21,490 --> 02:38:25,390
Floating red figure that was found inside a secret area below a large abyss.

3130
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:48,670
And twelve.

3131
02:38:50,530 --> 02:38:51,730
What is this one?

3132
02:38:57,330 --> 02:38:58,390
Oh my gosh!

3133
02:38:58,570 --> 02:39:00,630
It's that one Stephen King book!

3134
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:13,310
Rose... Rose... Rose Manchin... Rose... Rose... Rose Red!

3135
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:13,910
Yes!

3136
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:16,550
Rose Red.

3137
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:18,390
The Arby's Demon.

3138
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:27,580
The specimen sometimes chooses a host to possess and uses them to attack the species.

3139
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:30,540
The subject, with various means depending on the host's characteristics.

3140
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:37,440
Not much is known about the origin of the mansion, but signs occasionally show an earlier massacre or tragedy has taken place within the mansion.

3141
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:42,460
Proved very effective, but varies itself too often to be a reliable method of extraction.

3142
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,700
So that's what they call it.

3143
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:47,860
Extraction, eh?

3144
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:51,860
Boom!

3145
02:40:02,010 --> 02:40:03,430
Well, we're back here.

3146
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:06,730
I can't even tell...

3147
02:40:08,550 --> 02:40:14,710
So the demon guy, the Arby's Demon, he hides doors?

3148
02:40:16,310 --> 02:40:18,310
The mansion is a Clock Tower reference.

3149
02:40:20,430 --> 02:40:22,990
You know, I never played Clock Tower either.

3150
02:40:23,290 --> 02:40:24,570
I'm such a fake horror fan.

3151
02:40:25,490 --> 02:40:26,050
Really?

3152
02:40:26,190 --> 02:40:27,050
Double in a row?

3153
02:40:28,430 --> 02:40:29,850
Arby's Demon does hide doors.

3154
02:40:30,030 --> 02:40:30,230
Okay.

3155
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:35,270
So I could have... I could have made it out, maybe.

3156
02:40:35,890 --> 02:40:36,490
Dang it.

3157
02:40:39,010 --> 02:40:40,470
I think I went the wrong way.

3158
02:40:40,610 --> 02:40:40,930
Yep.

3159
02:40:51,820 --> 02:40:53,480
I'm just a horror enthusiast.

3160
02:40:58,040 --> 02:40:59,020
There... Oh yeah!

3161
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:00,040
Sorry.

3162
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:03,300
There's like... I'm kind of picky about what kind of...

3163
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:04,220
What kind of horror I like, though.

3164
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:05,600
Typically.

3165
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:10,380
I'm not just like, you know, like, to me...

3166
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:12,140
Oh!

3167
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:14,560
Remember this place?

3168
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:20,120
To me, like, you know, Resident Evil and stuff...

3169
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:22,440
I don't ever really consider horror.

3170
02:41:22,580 --> 02:41:23,120
Maybe 7.

3171
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:25,240
Oh.

3172
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:30,540
I guess we have to come here, don't we?

3173
02:41:31,300 --> 02:41:32,040
Dang it.

3174
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:33,840
Do I have to read the notes again?

3175
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:42,990
Resident Evil's more action than horror.

3176
02:41:43,130 --> 02:41:43,890
Yeah, exactly!

3177
02:41:44,230 --> 02:41:45,190
I always thought that too.

3178
02:41:46,950 --> 02:41:47,430
Okay.

3179
02:41:49,130 --> 02:41:50,510
Silent Hill I liked.

3180
02:41:51,130 --> 02:41:51,910
Oh, broken.

3181
02:41:52,850 --> 02:41:54,850
I'm just reading them just in case...

3182
02:41:56,870 --> 02:41:58,170
Oh, there's the note.

3183
02:41:58,630 --> 02:42:00,470
I'm reading them just in case...

3184
02:42:02,030 --> 02:42:02,710
There we go.

3185
02:42:03,430 --> 02:42:04,450
I have to.

3186
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:06,370
Any upcoming horror movies you're excited for?

3187
02:42:07,470 --> 02:42:07,970
Um...

3188
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:11,610
I just watched Red Letter Media's review on...

3189
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:13,850
Long Legs, I think it was.

3190
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:17,310
Which seemed okay.

3191
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:26,710
Oh, I just realized you can't sprint in here.

3192
02:42:28,490 --> 02:42:28,990
Okay.

3193
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,770
Good to know.

3194
02:42:33,290 --> 02:42:34,390
Long Legs is good.

3195
02:42:38,190 --> 02:42:41,550
Just gonna go the same way I did before.

3196
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:50,230
Where's the key?

3197
02:42:51,130 --> 02:42:52,070
Oh, there it is.

3198
02:42:53,210 --> 02:42:53,770
Ping-pong.

3199
02:42:56,170 --> 02:42:56,930
The Witch.

3200
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:57,630
Oh, yeah.

3201
02:42:57,710 --> 02:42:58,090
That one...

3202
02:42:58,090 --> 02:42:59,050
I like that one actually.

3203
02:42:59,150 --> 02:43:02,850
I don't mind slow, like, atmospheric horror, you know?

3204
02:43:05,630 --> 02:43:06,110
Okay.

3205
02:43:06,110 --> 02:43:07,390
So, this guy...

3206
02:43:08,670 --> 02:43:10,010
He hides the doors.

3207
02:43:10,210 --> 02:43:10,930
He hides doors.

3208
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:12,010
This is gonna be tricky.

3209
02:43:13,070 --> 02:43:14,670
I'm only at 710, though.

3210
02:43:14,770 --> 02:43:17,150
So, if I lose 10 levels, I guess it's not...

3211
02:43:18,650 --> 02:43:20,210
I guess it's not the end of the wor...

3212
02:43:21,030 --> 02:43:22,010
End of the world.

3213
02:43:22,310 --> 02:43:22,870
Oh, God.

3214
02:43:22,950 --> 02:43:23,670
I'm scared, though.

3215
02:43:26,970 --> 02:43:27,610
That's so unfair!

3216
02:43:31,010 --> 02:43:33,750
And he flies.

3217
02:43:33,750 --> 02:43:35,250
Oh, I just saw it disappear.

3218
02:43:37,390 --> 02:43:38,110
Oh, interesting.

3219
02:43:39,310 --> 02:43:39,870
Oh, my God.

3220
02:43:39,910 --> 02:43:40,810
Get out of my way.

3221
02:43:42,030 --> 02:43:43,390
This is now, not the time.

3222
02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:45,590
Oh, my God.

3223
02:43:45,610 --> 02:43:46,870
He's gonna fly straight towards me.

3224
02:43:47,430 --> 02:43:48,410
I have no stamina.

3225
02:43:51,010 --> 02:43:51,730
Oh, gosh.

3226
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:52,550
I don't know which way to go.

3227
02:43:52,730 --> 02:43:54,810
I'm gonna risk it this way.

3228
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:56,030
Please be right.

3229
02:43:57,050 --> 02:43:58,090
It was not right.

3230
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:10,600
I'm so tense right now.

3231
02:44:10,600 --> 02:44:11,880
I'm so tense right now.

3232
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:13,300
Okay.

3233
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:18,260
Oh, my God.

3234
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:18,580
Thank goodness.

3235
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:25,740
He's only...

3236
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:27,060
He's only...

3237
02:44:27,060 --> 02:44:28,060
Oh, is there one here?

3238
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:29,000
Yes.

3239
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:33,800
I was gonna say he's only hidden one door.

3240
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:36,160
But there he goes, hiding a second one!

3241
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:38,480
Oh, no.

3242
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:41,180
This is the really long room.

3243
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:43,920
No, this is evil.

3244
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:46,420
Oh, my God.

3245
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:48,000
I thought he was done chasing me.

3246
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:49,000
For a second.

3247
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:51,420
This is really evil to put me in a room with this guy.

3248
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:51,880
Come on.

3249
02:44:52,520 --> 02:44:53,720
In this room?

3250
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:56,020
With this guy who can float?

3251
02:44:57,460 --> 02:44:59,000
Oh, can I attack him?

3252
02:44:59,040 --> 02:44:59,340
I wonder.

3253
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:04,420
Hey, quit bugging me.

3254
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:05,180
I'm so tense.

3255
02:45:05,380 --> 02:45:06,180
Oh, my God.

3256
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:08,100
Don't just...

3257
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:10,480
Don't just disappear the door.

3258
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:12,140
Don't just disappear the door.

3259
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:17,160
Oh, my God.

3260
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:18,880
While I was in the middle of...

3261
02:45:19,940 --> 02:45:20,640
Oh, my God.

3262
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:21,180
Oh, my God.

3263
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:21,640
Oh, my God.

3264
02:45:24,260 --> 02:45:24,660
Please.

3265
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:26,080
Leave me alone!

3266
02:45:30,930 --> 02:45:32,750
I'm glad I'm seeing them before he...

3267
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:35,730
Before he disappears the...

3268
02:45:35,730 --> 02:45:36,350
No!

3269
02:45:39,270 --> 02:45:40,090
I'm so tense.

3270
02:45:40,210 --> 02:45:41,030
I'm so tense.

3271
02:45:41,210 --> 02:45:41,970
I'm so tense.

3272
02:45:42,050 --> 02:45:42,710
I'm so tense.

3273
02:45:44,750 --> 02:45:45,950
Wait, am I actually free?

3274
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,280
We did it!

3275
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:55,400
Oh, my gosh.

3276
02:45:55,540 --> 02:45:57,080
I'm going to have carpal tunnel from this.

3277
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:00,440
Oh, my goodness.

3278
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:01,960
Yeah!

3279
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:06,230
Okay.

3280
02:46:11,670 --> 02:46:12,270
Hold on.

3281
02:46:12,290 --> 02:46:13,550
I really need to stretch my hand.

3282
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:20,460
Oh, it wasn't my mouse that I was death gripping.

3283
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:21,140
It was the...

3284
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:24,140
It was the wasdom to move.

3285
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:25,280
I was just like...

3286
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:27,580
Trying to...

3287
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:30,360
I was trying to run as fast as I could.

3288
02:46:33,180 --> 02:46:35,040
How are you doing, buddy?

3289
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:39,040
Now you have the meat.

3290
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:42,280
Arby's.

3291
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:48,800
Oh.

3292
02:46:58,060 --> 02:46:59,260
Clinging on to that W.

3293
02:46:59,540 --> 02:46:59,740
I...

3294
02:46:59,740 --> 02:47:00,400
No.

3295
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:02,940
I really was.

3296
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:07,460
Oh.

3297
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:09,860
Day three.

3298
02:47:10,300 --> 02:47:12,440
Hallucinations are manifesting at increasing intervals.

3299
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:13,800
The cause is probably...

3300
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:15,280
I missed day one, didn't I?

3301
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:18,140
The cause is probably sleep deprivation or...

3302
02:47:18,140 --> 02:47:20,300
Or a gas that is being pumped into the rooms.

3303
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:21,900
I have...

3304
02:47:21,900 --> 02:47:23,360
Not yet been injured.

3305
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:25,100
So I don't think the cause is a brain injury...

3306
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:25,720
Or a blood clot.

3307
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:26,000
Oh.

3308
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:27,100
Look at you show off.

3309
02:47:27,960 --> 02:47:31,240
Has Rich Evans's laugh ever scared your cat?

3310
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:34,340
I don't think so.

3311
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:36,500
Meats.

3312
02:47:37,980 --> 02:47:38,560
What?

3313
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:40,700
Are you speaking from experience?

3314
02:47:41,940 --> 02:47:42,520
Oh.

3315
02:47:44,860 --> 02:47:46,100
We're back here again.

3316
02:47:47,500 --> 02:47:48,380
Game room.

3317
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:51,040
Not the same chair this time though.

3318
02:47:52,840 --> 02:47:54,120
Yawn got me to run.

3319
02:47:54,120 --> 02:47:54,840
Yawn.

3320
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:55,260
Run.

3321
02:47:57,080 --> 02:47:57,920
I'm sorry.

3322
02:47:58,260 --> 02:47:59,420
I can't stop yawn.

3323
02:47:59,980 --> 02:48:00,420
Oh.

3324
02:48:00,420 --> 02:48:00,820
The sun.

3325
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:02,760
Nah.

3326
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:05,720
744.

3327
02:48:17,890 --> 02:48:19,670
Hallucinations are manifesting at increasing intervals.

3328
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:19,730
Oh.

3329
02:48:20,610 --> 02:48:21,390
Day four.

3330
02:48:22,590 --> 02:48:24,010
I'm starting to lose track of time.

3331
02:48:24,130 --> 02:48:25,430
The battery on my phone became very low.

3332
02:48:25,510 --> 02:48:26,930
So I delegated it to save...

3333
02:48:27,610 --> 02:48:29,630
Delegated to save it in the case I find an exit.

3334
02:48:30,950 --> 02:48:31,830
Three months.

3335
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:32,090
Three months.

3336
02:48:32,110 --> 02:48:32,270
Three.

3337
02:48:32,490 --> 02:48:33,610
Thanks for three months.

3338
02:48:34,170 --> 02:48:34,730
Uh oh.

3339
02:48:34,770 --> 02:48:34,890
No.

3340
02:48:35,370 --> 02:48:35,850
Oh.

3341
02:48:35,870 --> 02:48:36,430
It's this room.

3342
02:48:39,030 --> 02:48:39,510
Okay.

3343
02:48:39,510 --> 02:48:39,930
One.

3344
02:48:48,250 --> 02:48:49,670
We don't read it.

3345
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:50,210
Don't care.

3346
02:48:50,470 --> 02:48:52,450
This guy is gonna come after us.

3347
02:48:57,410 --> 02:48:57,890
Now.

3348
02:48:58,070 --> 02:48:59,250
Are you guys ready to scream?

3349
02:49:00,250 --> 02:49:00,730
Woo!

3350
02:49:02,110 --> 02:49:02,330
Oh.

3351
02:49:02,990 --> 02:49:03,710
Wha?

3352
02:49:04,270 --> 02:49:04,990
Wha?

3353
02:49:06,810 --> 02:49:07,530
Oh.

3354
02:49:09,450 --> 02:49:10,170
Okay.

3355
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:14,250
Collegian.

3356
02:49:14,250 --> 02:49:15,730
I hope I said your name right.

3357
02:49:15,790 --> 02:49:16,550
Thanks for joining.

3358
02:49:17,870 --> 02:49:18,590
Left.

3359
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:19,890
Right.

3360
02:49:20,910 --> 02:49:21,630
Straight.

3361
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:24,090
Right.

3362
02:49:24,990 --> 02:49:25,710
Straight.

3363
02:49:27,050 --> 02:49:29,090
Then go left.

3364
02:49:29,810 --> 02:49:30,530
Straight.

3365
02:49:30,670 --> 02:49:31,390
Go left.

3366
02:49:31,390 --> 02:49:31,590
Go left.

3367
02:49:31,590 --> 02:49:31,610
Go left.

3368
02:49:31,610 --> 02:49:31,630
Go left.

3369
02:49:32,110 --> 02:49:33,010
Straight.

3370
02:49:33,570 --> 02:49:35,910
Straight again.

3371
02:49:36,450 --> 02:49:36,810
Oh.

3372
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:37,430
Straight.

3373
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:38,890
Straight.

3374
02:49:39,190 --> 02:49:40,470
Left.

3375
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:44,350
Right.

3376
02:49:45,690 --> 02:49:47,090
Strait.

3377
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:49,430
Left.

3378
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:53,330
Straight.

3379
02:50:09,290 --> 02:50:11,030
Unlimited stamina to race to the end.

3380
02:50:11,090 --> 02:50:11,770
The final stretch!

3381
02:50:12,770 --> 02:50:13,570
Password cake.

3382
02:50:34,340 --> 02:50:36,380
She actually gave me a gift!

3383
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:38,540
Unlimited stamina!

3384
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:43,240
Cake.

3385
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:46,920
Thank you so much for the gift!

3386
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:48,040
Thank you!

3387
02:50:48,740 --> 02:50:50,880
Oh my gosh, thank you so much!

3388
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:53,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3389
02:50:57,740 --> 02:50:58,700
Thank you!

3390
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:03,060
Does it like take away my health or something?

3391
02:51:03,240 --> 02:51:03,660
Wait...

3392
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:06,200
Why is my stamina not working anymore?

3393
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,380
Wait, I have unlimited stamina but I can't run!

3394
02:51:13,990 --> 02:51:15,030
Oh my god, no way!

3395
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:16,690
I can't run!

3396
02:51:17,510 --> 02:51:18,410
I can't run!

3397
02:51:24,770 --> 02:51:25,990
She's so evil!

3398
02:51:26,170 --> 02:51:26,990
She's so evil!

3399
02:51:27,170 --> 02:51:28,110
She's so evil!

3400
02:51:29,130 --> 02:51:31,330
She made sure your stamina doesn't run out!

3401
02:51:33,030 --> 02:51:34,670
Oh my god...

3402
02:51:35,250 --> 02:51:37,130
Wait, is it like this the rest of the game?

3403
02:51:40,470 --> 02:51:40,950
No...

3404
02:51:40,950 --> 02:51:43,350
And with the goop monster, this is so evil.

3405
02:51:43,350 --> 02:51:44,590
No, no, no, no.

3406
02:51:44,830 --> 02:51:46,390
With the goop monster, please!

3407
02:51:47,490 --> 02:51:48,770
Please, please, please!

3408
02:51:51,070 --> 02:51:52,770
Please, please, please!

3409
02:51:54,310 --> 02:51:55,190
Oh my gosh.

3410
02:51:55,930 --> 02:51:57,870
This is so evil.

3411
02:51:57,990 --> 02:51:58,730
This is so evil.

3412
02:52:02,090 --> 02:52:03,670
Oh my god, what is that noise?

3413
02:52:04,170 --> 02:52:04,930
What was that?

3414
02:52:09,470 --> 02:52:11,070
Forgot to turn the volume back down.

3415
02:52:15,930 --> 02:52:16,890
Oh my gosh.

3416
02:52:17,790 --> 02:52:18,270
Please.

3417
02:52:18,490 --> 02:52:19,670
Oh, I got it back!

3418
02:52:23,770 --> 02:52:24,250
Wait.

3419
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:27,710
When did it come back?

3420
02:52:28,890 --> 02:52:30,050
Stamina is yellow again.

3421
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:31,490
She's so rude!

3422
02:52:33,650 --> 02:52:34,130
Okay.

3423
02:52:34,650 --> 02:52:35,730
Oh my gosh.

3424
02:52:38,470 --> 02:52:40,990
I really thought it would be like that for the rest of the game.

3425
02:52:45,190 --> 02:52:45,630
766.

3426
02:52:55,130 --> 02:52:56,230
I can't remember.

3427
02:52:56,490 --> 02:52:57,270
Why did I come here?

3428
02:52:57,490 --> 02:52:58,310
Was there ever a purpose?

3429
02:52:58,530 --> 02:53:00,450
I believe death is steadily approaching me now.

3430
02:53:00,570 --> 02:53:02,350
The hallucinations can hurt me.

3431
02:53:03,470 --> 02:53:07,310
I'm out of provisions and I'm suddenly having violent heart palpitations.

3432
02:53:09,390 --> 02:53:10,610
Not the palpitations.

3433
02:53:10,610 --> 02:53:11,090
Ruh-roh.

3434
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:14,230
Get stumped.

3435
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:19,310
769.

3436
02:53:20,010 --> 02:53:22,190
Not the palpitations.

3437
02:53:23,270 --> 02:53:24,930
Emperor palpitations.

3438
02:53:25,650 --> 02:53:26,870
Emperor...

3439
02:53:26,870 --> 02:53:27,650
Emperor...

3440
02:53:27,650 --> 02:53:28,590
Oh!

3441
02:53:29,190 --> 02:53:30,690
Avid reader!

3442
02:53:31,090 --> 02:53:33,430
These are their stories.

3443
02:53:33,430 --> 02:53:34,090
That was the achievement.

3444
02:54:00,830 --> 02:54:02,230
Day 7.

3445
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:03,650
Super Mintette!

3446
02:54:04,090 --> 02:54:05,770
Mint Nendo.

3447
02:54:07,590 --> 02:54:08,630
Welcome to membership.

3448
02:54:08,810 --> 02:54:09,310
Thank you!

3449
02:54:11,470 --> 02:54:12,850
They're watching over me.

3450
02:54:12,910 --> 02:54:13,990
I have a guardian angel!

3451
02:54:19,810 --> 02:54:21,230
Wait, what's this one again?

3452
02:54:22,970 --> 02:54:23,890
Wait, what's this one?

3453
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:25,150
Oh shoot, I don't remember.

3454
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:28,070
Oh, okay.

3455
02:54:29,990 --> 02:54:30,710
I know.

3456
02:54:34,150 --> 02:54:34,830
I know!

3457
02:54:35,230 --> 02:54:35,630
Beef

3458
02:54:39,300 --> 02:54:39,760
demon!

3459
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:40,700
Beef demon!

3460
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:44,920
And we've got the meats!

3461
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:46,740
We've got the meats!

3462
02:54:46,820 --> 02:54:47,540
We've got the meats!

3463
02:54:47,620 --> 02:54:48,420
We've got the meats!

3464
02:54:49,700 --> 02:54:50,720
Yeah, it's kind of...

3465
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:54,700
kind of icky though that his description doesn't say that he can get rid of the doors.

3466
02:54:54,800 --> 02:54:55,280
You know what I mean?

3467
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:57,560
But I guess if you...

3468
02:54:58,140 --> 02:55:03,440
I think I... I think I got really unlucky in that I didn't have a room where I could say that he would do that.

3469
02:55:03,540 --> 02:55:04,080
You know what I mean?

3470
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:06,220
Oh, we made it!

3471
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:07,720
I just kept running.

3472
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:11,140
So I had no idea.

3473
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:12,320
I just thought it was a dead end.

3474
02:55:12,420 --> 02:55:14,140
I thought it was supposed to happen that way.

3475
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:20,160
I smell like beef.

3476
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:22,800
I smell like beef.

3477
02:55:24,120 --> 02:55:25,700
I smell like beef.

3478
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:31,220
788, baby.

3479
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:40,160
That was unlucky.

3480
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:41,100
Yeah, I think so too.

3481
02:55:41,540 --> 02:55:44,700
And then, you know, when I'm running away I don't really... I can't...

3482
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:46,600
Oh my god!

3483
02:55:48,980 --> 02:55:49,820
Wait, what is this one?

3484
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:51,220
Oh my god!

3485
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:53,120
Oh, it's this guy!

3486
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:54,380
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

3487
02:55:54,520 --> 02:55:55,180
Oh, it's this guy!

3488
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:55,580
It's this guy!

3489
02:55:55,640 --> 02:55:55,980
It's this guy!

3490
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:56,760
Okay, never mind.

3491
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:57,140
We're good.

3492
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:57,420
We're good.

3493
02:55:57,460 --> 02:55:57,700
We're good.

3494
02:55:58,380 --> 02:55:59,080
Come on, baby!

3495
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:00,300
Come on, baby, baby!

3496
02:56:03,280 --> 02:56:03,840
The thing.

3497
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:04,320
It's the thing.

3498
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:04,580
Yeah.

3499
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:08,420
The thing.

3500
02:56:08,580 --> 02:56:08,720
It's the thing.

3501
02:56:08,720 --> 02:56:08,720
Yeah.

3502
02:56:08,720 --> 02:56:08,980
I got it.

3503
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:12,140
Come on, baby!

3504
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:15,200
Yeah.

3505
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:19,220
Oh!

3506
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:20,240
This way.

3507
02:56:20,600 --> 02:56:21,180
This way.

3508
02:56:22,940 --> 02:56:23,520
Uh-oh.

3509
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:24,180
Not this way!

3510
02:56:27,540 --> 02:56:28,640
Not this way!

3511
02:56:29,280 --> 02:56:29,720
Rude.

3512
02:56:30,260 --> 02:56:31,620
Rude, rude, rude, rude, rude.

3513
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:34,240
Rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude.

3514
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:35,640
Yep.

3515
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:42,700
Oh my god.

3516
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:42,860
No!

3517
02:56:43,020 --> 02:56:43,220
No!

3518
02:56:45,260 --> 02:56:47,500
How did I get too far away from you, huh?

3519
02:56:52,230 --> 02:56:54,090
The rude sandstorm.

3520
02:56:58,670 --> 02:56:59,230
Oh!

3521
02:57:01,410 --> 02:57:02,510
We made it!

3522
02:57:02,650 --> 02:57:03,410
Oh my gosh!

3523
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:03,710
800!

3524
02:57:04,390 --> 02:57:04,810
Yippee!

3525
02:57:08,590 --> 02:57:10,470
We're going down, down.

3526
02:57:10,830 --> 02:57:12,310
Bigger, bigger, bigger, down.

3527
02:57:12,830 --> 02:57:14,670
Sugar, we're going down.

3528
02:57:14,810 --> 02:57:15,050
Screaming!

3529
02:57:16,440 --> 02:57:18,510
Number one with the mullet.

3530
02:57:18,670 --> 02:57:21,050
A number one cockpit.

3531
02:57:21,270 --> 02:57:22,330
Cockpit and bullet.

3532
02:57:27,470 --> 02:57:28,670
Mint gaming.

3533
02:57:29,350 --> 02:57:29,810
Yippee!

3534
02:57:36,940 --> 02:57:38,220
Oh my god.

3535
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:39,740
Left.

3536
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:40,720
Left.

3537
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:41,740
Left.

3538
02:57:42,040 --> 02:57:42,120
Left.

3539
02:57:43,160 --> 02:57:43,920
800.

3540
02:57:50,870 --> 02:57:52,530
This is a new room.

3541
02:57:57,390 --> 02:57:58,270
Interesting.

3542
02:57:59,210 --> 02:58:00,470
Oh no!

3543
02:58:03,390 --> 02:58:04,270
No!

3544
02:58:05,650 --> 02:58:06,530
No!

3545
02:58:06,990 --> 02:58:08,450
I'm trapped in the goop.

3546
02:58:08,490 --> 02:58:09,830
Trapped in the O's.

3547
02:58:10,310 --> 02:58:12,190
I'm trapped in the goop.

3548
02:58:18,220 --> 02:58:20,340
These goop guys...

3549
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:22,860
are too...

3550
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:23,940
nasty.

3551
02:58:29,570 --> 02:58:30,130
Woah!

3552
02:58:32,970 --> 02:58:33,530
Woah!

3553
02:58:34,930 --> 02:58:35,830
Remilia-sama?

3554
02:58:38,130 --> 02:58:39,370
Is this Castlevania?

3555
02:58:44,960 --> 02:58:46,320
I like this.

3556
02:58:47,500 --> 02:58:48,620
This is new.

3557
02:58:49,420 --> 02:58:51,060
This mansion is strange.

3558
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:53,920
I think the bricks and wood are actually just painted on.

3559
02:58:54,180 --> 02:58:56,020
Everything still feels kind of fake.

3560
02:58:56,220 --> 02:58:58,420
Also I keep hearing movement and voices below me.

3561
02:58:58,420 --> 02:59:00,460
Maybe other survivors are hiding down there.

3562
02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:00,680
Yeah.

3563
02:59:02,620 --> 02:59:03,500
Other survivors.

3564
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:05,200
Oh look, there's the door.

3565
02:59:05,780 --> 02:59:06,920
But I want to explore.

3566
02:59:07,540 --> 02:59:08,240
Oh, broken.

3567
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:11,280
A wine cellar?

3568
02:59:12,140 --> 02:59:12,580
Woah!

3569
02:59:12,800 --> 02:59:13,180
Frog!

3570
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:14,420
Thank you for the Hakusuba!

3571
02:59:14,980 --> 02:59:16,260
Number one combo.

3572
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:17,320
Fries and some nuggets.

3573
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:22,760
I can hear him coming down the hallway.

3574
02:59:23,060 --> 02:59:24,500
I need to hide but I don't know where.

3575
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:27,840
I now know this is not an exit or a resting place.

3576
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:29,460
It's just another specimen room.

3577
02:59:29,620 --> 02:59:31,080
I think he's outside the door now.

3578
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:31,560
Uh oh.

3579
02:59:33,140 --> 02:59:33,540
Hide?

3580
02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:41,070
No, no, no, no.

3581
02:59:47,540 --> 02:59:48,180
I'm hiding.

3582
02:59:48,540 --> 02:59:49,160
I'm hiding.

3583
02:59:57,800 --> 02:59:58,700
Can he see me?

3584
03:00:01,020 --> 03:00:02,640
Wait, will he actually be able to see me?

3585
03:00:09,220 --> 03:00:10,020
Oh my god.

3586
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:15,510
Oh my god.

3587
03:00:15,550 --> 03:00:15,730
Scary.

3588
03:00:19,670 --> 03:00:20,870
That's actually really scary.

3589
03:00:21,210 --> 03:00:22,010
Oh my gosh.

3590
03:00:26,550 --> 03:00:28,710
He can smell you take a bath, stinky.

3591
03:00:29,090 --> 03:00:29,450
Hey!

3592
03:00:34,190 --> 03:00:36,090
He can smell you guys!

3593
03:00:36,190 --> 03:00:36,790
He can smell!

3594
03:00:47,500 --> 03:00:48,320
I'm getting hit.

3595
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:48,560
The heck?

3596
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:52,520
Everything is

3597
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:55,840
broken.

3598
03:00:58,560 --> 03:00:59,740
I don't want to die here.

3599
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:00,720
Locked.

3600
03:01:03,260 --> 03:01:03,940
Upstairs maybe?

3601
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:06,120
I can smell.

3602
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:07,740
Everything is locked!

3603
03:01:11,240 --> 03:01:12,880
I somehow managed to get away.

3604
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:14,120
But I don't know for how long.

3605
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:16,440
I hear him even when I know he's not there.

3606
03:01:16,660 --> 03:01:17,780
It's like he isn't even real.

3607
03:01:17,780 --> 03:01:18,600
But instead of my own...

3608
03:01:18,600 --> 03:01:21,540
Instead of my own fears manifesting themselves and stalking me.

3609
03:01:22,940 --> 03:01:23,920
Can I hide in here?

3610
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:26,600
Is there a key?

3611
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:31,380
Uh...

3612
03:01:32,380 --> 03:01:32,820
Uh...

3613
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:35,320
I only watch you, Mint.

3614
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:36,100
I...

3615
03:01:37,020 --> 03:01:37,460
No!

3616
03:01:37,460 --> 03:01:39,360
Watch whoever you want to watch.

3617
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:46,760
Did I miss something?

3618
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:49,640
Hmm...

3619
03:01:51,950 --> 03:01:53,250
Key in the fireplace?

3620
03:01:53,730 --> 03:01:54,270
Oh!

3621
03:01:54,870 --> 03:01:55,770
Bedroom key.

3622
03:01:55,990 --> 03:01:56,750
Thank you!

3623
03:01:58,690 --> 03:01:59,370
Oh...

3624
03:01:59,370 --> 03:02:01,570
Maybe upstairs is a bedroom.

3625
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:03,590
Or down here.

3626
03:02:04,730 --> 03:02:07,070
I watch everyone except...

3627
03:02:07,070 --> 03:02:07,450
Mint.

3628
03:02:10,170 --> 03:02:12,350
Oh wait, this is where we came from.

3629
03:02:17,900 --> 03:02:18,580
Hide.

3630
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:22,160
He can...

3631
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:23,680
He knows how to smell.

3632
03:02:25,260 --> 03:02:26,400
He knows how to smell.

3633
03:02:26,520 --> 03:02:27,200
He knows how to smell.

3634
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:29,500
I can smell.

3635
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:37,560
So scary.

3636
03:02:40,140 --> 03:02:41,180
I can smell.

3637
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:05,180
No way!

3638
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:06,020
He can smell!

3639
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:06,780
And he can see!

3640
03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:14,120
And he can see!

3641
03:03:14,120 --> 03:03:14,560
He has...

3642
03:03:14,560 --> 03:03:16,400
I think he has all five senses, you guys.

3643
03:03:16,460 --> 03:03:17,040
This is bad.

3644
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:17,680
This is bad.

3645
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:21,760
Oh wait, what's this over here?

3646
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:23,840
The music is awesome.

3647
03:03:24,320 --> 03:03:24,960
What is this?

3648
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:25,740
Wow, a mansion!

3649
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:27,040
Inside another mansion.

3650
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:29,360
Maybe I've made it all the way to the end of the house.

3651
03:03:29,560 --> 03:03:31,840
Maybe this is like a resting place or another entrance perhaps.

3652
03:03:32,140 --> 03:03:34,240
Whatever the case, I think this is a good spot to rest.

3653
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:34,600
Okay.

3654
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:37,080
Well, you were wrong.

3655
03:03:41,380 --> 03:03:42,940
Uh oh, there's nowhere to hide in here.

3656
03:03:43,960 --> 03:03:44,600
Uh oh.

3657
03:03:45,420 --> 03:03:46,780
The music is a bop.

3658
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:49,580
Parlor key?

3659
03:03:53,160 --> 03:03:54,820
What other rooms have I missed?

3660
03:03:55,660 --> 03:03:56,400
Maybe here?

3661
03:03:58,200 --> 03:03:59,660
Uh, this is broken.

3662
03:03:59,760 --> 03:04:00,340
This is broken.

3663
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:02,760
The other side.

3664
03:04:03,620 --> 03:04:04,880
Where is Patty?

3665
03:04:05,280 --> 03:04:05,800
Right!

3666
03:04:06,440 --> 03:04:07,380
This is broken.

3667
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:09,560
That was that room.

3668
03:04:10,640 --> 03:04:11,940
Where did I miss?

3669
03:04:12,160 --> 03:04:12,460
Here?

3670
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:13,440
Is this the parlor?

3671
03:04:13,580 --> 03:04:14,120
No.

3672
03:04:24,970 --> 03:04:25,930
Was it this one?

3673
03:04:26,170 --> 03:04:26,910
No, wait.

3674
03:04:26,970 --> 03:04:27,830
I went in here.

3675
03:04:28,490 --> 03:04:29,710
This is the other bedroom.

3676
03:04:29,990 --> 03:04:30,790
What am I missing?

3677
03:04:32,590 --> 03:04:34,310
Yeah, he'll hear me next time.

3678
03:04:39,710 --> 03:04:40,710
This was...

3679
03:04:41,950 --> 03:04:42,850
Maybe one of these.

3680
03:04:42,870 --> 03:04:44,350
I'm so... Am I stupid?

3681
03:04:46,010 --> 03:04:46,970
Broken, broken.

3682
03:04:47,450 --> 03:04:47,950
Huh?

3683
03:04:49,910 --> 03:04:51,770
He'll taste me next time!

3684
03:04:57,020 --> 03:04:58,220
Boom, boom, boom.

3685
03:04:58,380 --> 03:04:58,960
Oh, no.

3686
03:04:59,080 --> 03:04:59,540
This is...

3687
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:01,280
Maybe down here?

3688
03:05:03,460 --> 03:05:04,080
Ah!

3689
03:05:05,580 --> 03:05:06,400
Oh my god.

3690
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:07,260
Hide.

3691
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:09,760
Boom, boom, boom.

3692
03:05:09,840 --> 03:05:10,860
Boom, boom, boom.

3693
03:05:20,010 --> 03:05:21,490
He's gonna taste me.

3694
03:05:22,310 --> 03:05:23,850
Don't taste me, mister!

3695
03:05:24,450 --> 03:05:26,470
You'll like being dead.

3696
03:05:26,770 --> 03:05:28,010
I promise.

3697
03:05:28,610 --> 03:05:29,650
I do, actually.

3698
03:06:19,540 --> 03:06:20,880
Am I safe?

3699
03:06:24,240 --> 03:06:25,400
Am I safe?

3700
03:06:35,720 --> 03:06:37,160
He left a cake.

3701
03:06:39,660 --> 03:06:41,900
Can't believe he didn't say, I hear.

3702
03:06:42,620 --> 03:06:45,000
I picked up the book.

3703
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:47,460
And, um...

3704
03:06:50,700 --> 03:06:52,140
To the library?

3705
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:57,400
I taste...

3706
03:06:57,400 --> 03:06:59,040
Cake...

3707
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:00,580
I read...

3708
03:07:00,580 --> 03:07:07,140
I taste...

3709
03:07:07,140 --> 03:07:07,940
Oh.

3710
03:07:09,100 --> 03:07:10,420
Are you winning, Mint?

3711
03:07:12,740 --> 03:07:13,300
Um...

3712
03:07:13,300 --> 03:07:13,920
No!

3713
03:07:14,900 --> 03:07:15,180
No.

3714
03:07:15,460 --> 03:07:16,480
No, I'm not.

3715
03:07:16,700 --> 03:07:17,680
No, I'm not.

3716
03:07:18,700 --> 03:07:19,820
No, I'm...

3717
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:21,500
I'm not winning.

3718
03:07:21,640 --> 03:07:22,420
I feel...

3719
03:07:23,360 --> 03:07:24,580
Very... Oh my god.

3720
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:27,000
Oh my god.

3721
03:07:32,510 --> 03:07:33,830
This is so icky.

3722
03:07:33,910 --> 03:07:35,530
It makes me so claustrophobic.

3723
03:07:36,730 --> 03:07:38,070
There's too much particles.

3724
03:07:38,070 --> 03:07:38,150
There's too much particles.

3725
03:07:41,070 --> 03:07:41,730
What is that?

3726
03:07:41,790 --> 03:07:42,130
What is that?

3727
03:07:42,130 --> 03:07:45,450
What is it like when the air is super still and hasn't been touched in a long time?

3728
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:46,410
Dead air or something?

3729
03:07:49,310 --> 03:07:50,410
Can I hide in here?

3730
03:07:50,510 --> 03:07:50,970
I'm scared.

3731
03:07:51,090 --> 03:07:51,470
Oh, hide.

3732
03:08:05,620 --> 03:08:07,600
I can't tell if he can see me in here.

3733
03:08:07,660 --> 03:08:08,940
Which is why I'm hiding in the corner.

3734
03:08:12,040 --> 03:08:12,820
Playing amnesia now.

3735
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:13,360
I know, right?

3736
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:42,340
I can smell you.

3737
03:08:42,420 --> 03:08:43,060
You're in the basement.

3738
03:08:44,700 --> 03:08:45,660
Have fun, Mint.

3739
03:08:46,040 --> 03:08:46,540
Thanks.

3740
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:47,460
I think.

3741
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:50,020
Exit key.

3742
03:08:55,150 --> 03:08:58,130
Now getting out of here is probably going to be the tougher part.

3743
03:09:00,990 --> 03:09:02,010
I'm sure of it.

3744
03:09:04,870 --> 03:09:05,870
God, this...

3745
03:09:06,620 --> 03:09:08,490
makes me feel so gross.

3746
03:09:09,030 --> 03:09:10,270
I hate it.

3747
03:09:11,890 --> 03:09:12,630
Oh my god.

3748
03:09:13,110 --> 03:09:13,750
No way.

3749
03:09:19,660 --> 03:09:21,040
That was so close.

3750
03:09:25,750 --> 03:09:27,090
Was everything green before?

3751
03:09:28,950 --> 03:09:30,310
That was red, wasn't it?

3752
03:09:32,030 --> 03:09:32,670
Oh my god.

3753
03:09:32,930 --> 03:09:33,650
Oh my god.

3754
03:09:33,890 --> 03:09:37,010
Wait, is this...

3755
03:09:46,050 --> 03:09:47,570
I thought it was...

3756
03:09:47,570 --> 03:09:49,570
the guy that needs to stay close to me.

3757
03:09:50,030 --> 03:09:50,810
Not the man.

3758
03:09:52,150 --> 03:09:53,950
But he can't go through the goop either, right?

3759
03:09:54,470 --> 03:09:54,990
Haha!

3760
03:09:55,850 --> 03:09:56,370
Yeah!

3761
03:09:57,910 --> 03:09:58,990
We're both goop-less!

3762
03:10:00,110 --> 03:10:00,850
Oh my god.

3763
03:10:01,410 --> 03:10:03,270
He is not giving up.

3764
03:10:05,010 --> 03:10:06,130
Oh, chains.

3765
03:10:08,530 --> 03:10:09,370
Oh my god!

3766
03:10:09,730 --> 03:10:10,570
Oh my god.

3767
03:10:11,210 --> 03:10:14,510
So if he sees me, he goes like crazy.

3768
03:10:14,510 --> 03:10:15,450
He goes sicko mode.

3769
03:10:16,090 --> 03:10:16,790
I think.

3770
03:10:16,810 --> 03:10:18,730
He starts like running crazy, right?

3771
03:10:23,630 --> 03:10:24,330
Oh my god.

3772
03:10:24,430 --> 03:10:25,090
Oh my god.

3773
03:10:26,590 --> 03:10:27,390
Demon noises.

3774
03:10:27,810 --> 03:10:28,670
It's so scary.

3775
03:10:29,310 --> 03:10:30,190
It's so scary.

3776
03:10:32,350 --> 03:10:32,750
Okay.

3777
03:10:39,350 --> 03:10:42,750
That's why these hallways are some of the scarier ones.

3778
03:10:45,450 --> 03:10:46,050
Oh my god.

3779
03:10:46,110 --> 03:10:46,650
Never mind.

3780
03:10:46,930 --> 03:10:48,150
He's just going sicko mode.

3781
03:10:48,190 --> 03:10:50,130
Oh my god.

3782
03:10:50,190 --> 03:10:51,070
Oh, I went the wrong way.

3783
03:10:51,070 --> 03:10:51,750
Oh, shoot.

3784
03:10:51,930 --> 03:10:52,510
Oh, shoot.

3785
03:10:55,190 --> 03:10:57,930
I can't tell what he looks like when he makes that noise.

3786
03:10:58,030 --> 03:10:58,770
I can't tell.

3787
03:10:58,830 --> 03:10:59,550
At all.

3788
03:11:01,450 --> 03:11:02,530
Oh, please.

3789
03:11:03,050 --> 03:11:04,330
Please end my misery.

3790
03:11:08,990 --> 03:11:09,530
Yeah!

3791
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:23,140
Your imagination is scarier either way.

3792
03:11:23,280 --> 03:11:24,020
Oh, goodness.

3793
03:11:24,020 --> 03:11:25,700
Look at the chains!

3794
03:11:27,540 --> 03:11:29,020
P&G chains!

3795
03:11:42,020 --> 03:11:43,540
I still cut him in half.

3796
03:11:47,780 --> 03:11:49,820
I think I at least gave this guy a candle.

3797
03:11:54,400 --> 03:11:56,440
Oh, plus one violence.

3798
03:11:58,220 --> 03:11:58,780
Why?

3799
03:12:04,850 --> 03:12:07,110
Actually, I just wanted to see if it would happen.

3800
03:12:08,590 --> 03:12:10,610
It's not that it was because he was a ghost.

3801
03:12:11,410 --> 03:12:13,870
It just was because he was there.

3802
03:12:15,070 --> 03:12:15,650
You know?

3803
03:12:18,070 --> 03:12:19,510
It wasn't because he was a ghost.

3804
03:12:19,630 --> 03:12:22,270
It was because he was my little experiment.

3805
03:12:24,750 --> 03:12:26,310
You think that'll hold up in court?

3806
03:12:27,350 --> 03:12:28,630
There can only be one ghost?

3807
03:12:29,170 --> 03:12:30,490
See, I'll do it to him too!

3808
03:12:33,030 --> 03:12:33,430
Haha!

3809
03:12:33,490 --> 03:12:33,850
Haha!

3810
03:12:40,190 --> 03:12:40,590
840.

3811
03:12:43,150 --> 03:12:45,150
We've been at this for three hours.

3812
03:12:51,920 --> 03:12:52,720
Jack-o'-lantern.

3813
03:12:53,400 --> 03:12:54,600
Oh, skinny hallway.

3814
03:12:56,240 --> 03:12:57,100
What's that sound?

3815
03:12:58,420 --> 03:12:59,220
What's that sound?

3816
03:12:59,460 --> 03:13:01,960
Wait, the axe cause is a bad ending if you use it too much?

3817
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:02,320
No way!

3818
03:13:03,140 --> 03:13:04,540
Even if I don't use it on anything?

3819
03:13:04,680 --> 03:13:07,700
Even if I just swing it around town?

3820
03:13:18,490 --> 03:13:19,310
There's a counter.

3821
03:13:19,590 --> 03:13:20,030
There's a counter.

3822
03:13:20,330 --> 03:13:22,750
Oh, if you kill too many monsters with it.

3823
03:13:22,950 --> 03:13:23,790
Well, what about the...

3824
03:13:23,790 --> 03:13:26,810
Well, I guess they count as monsters because they were in the specimen book.

3825
03:13:28,510 --> 03:13:29,150
Oh, shoot.

3826
03:13:29,790 --> 03:13:30,230
No!

3827
03:13:31,930 --> 03:13:32,370
No!

3828
03:13:32,650 --> 03:13:33,890
I'm thinking Arby's!

3829
03:13:34,070 --> 03:13:35,670
I'm not thinking Arby's!

3830
03:13:37,170 --> 03:13:37,610
Please!

3831
03:13:40,590 --> 03:13:42,110
Okay, I won't kill you anymore!

3832
03:13:42,110 --> 03:13:43,570
The deli demon!

3833
03:13:47,090 --> 03:13:48,510
He's still after me.

3834
03:13:48,610 --> 03:13:49,270
Oh, shoot.

3835
03:13:49,410 --> 03:13:50,070
This way?

3836
03:13:51,890 --> 03:13:53,330
We got the meat!

3837
03:13:54,090 --> 03:13:54,930
Oh my god!

3838
03:13:55,410 --> 03:13:57,910
Why is it sometimes...

3839
03:13:57,910 --> 03:13:59,970
Does he get too close and that's why it starts flashing?

3840
03:14:06,260 --> 03:14:06,860
Meat!

3841
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:07,580
Meat!

3842
03:14:17,440 --> 03:14:18,040
No!

3843
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:21,340
I swear I'll go vegetarian after this!

3844
03:14:21,460 --> 03:14:23,460
I swear I'll never eat another burger!

3845
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:25,940
Please!

3846
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:28,280
Just let me go, Arby's!

3847
03:14:30,040 --> 03:14:30,640
Oh!

3848
03:14:30,680 --> 03:14:31,220
Nope!

3849
03:14:32,600 --> 03:14:33,820
The music stopped!

3850
03:14:33,960 --> 03:14:34,760
I thought we were good!

3851
03:14:35,060 --> 03:14:36,220
Oh, he's still after me.

3852
03:14:38,680 --> 03:14:41,160
Still very much after...

3853
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:41,560
Shit!

3854
03:14:42,160 --> 03:14:42,980
Oh my god!

3855
03:14:46,660 --> 03:14:47,060
Oh!

3856
03:14:47,200 --> 03:14:47,980
Wait, did I...

3857
03:14:48,980 --> 03:14:49,700
Oh my god!

3858
03:14:49,740 --> 03:14:51,420
I thought he was still after me, but he wasn't!

3859
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:53,360
Oh my gosh!

3860
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:56,560
We made it at the best possible room!

3861
03:14:57,820 --> 03:14:58,820
Oh my gosh!

3862
03:14:59,020 --> 03:14:59,180
Oh my gosh!

3863
03:15:01,460 --> 03:15:02,520
I'm scared, Minto!

3864
03:15:02,740 --> 03:15:03,500
Don't be scared.

3865
03:15:03,640 --> 03:15:04,360
I'll get you through this.

3866
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:05,640
I'll get you through this.

3867
03:15:14,270 --> 03:15:15,070
We're just...

3868
03:15:24,330 --> 03:15:25,770
I thought it was the...

3869
03:15:26,870 --> 03:15:27,570
I thought it was the...

3870
03:15:27,570 --> 03:15:28,870
I didn't realize it was the creepy crawly!

3871
03:15:28,950 --> 03:15:29,770
I thought it was the...

3872
03:15:29,770 --> 03:15:31,270
The guy I gotta keep close!

3873
03:15:33,030 --> 03:15:35,210
I thought it was the guy I gotta keep close!

3874
03:15:35,410 --> 03:15:35,630
I thought it was the guy I gotta keep close!

3875
03:15:35,630 --> 03:15:36,990
Nope, I see them on the ceiling now.

3876
03:15:37,170 --> 03:15:38,430
Oh, it's because the ceilings...

3877
03:15:38,430 --> 03:15:39,870
I think were high before!

3878
03:15:42,870 --> 03:15:43,790
Oh my gosh!

3879
03:15:43,870 --> 03:15:44,830
That's so funny.

3880
03:15:45,170 --> 03:15:46,810
Yeah, I can't see it from here.

3881
03:15:48,470 --> 03:15:50,430
The ceilings were too high.

3882
03:15:50,670 --> 03:15:50,750
The ceilings were too high.

3883
03:15:51,850 --> 03:15:52,850
It's over?

3884
03:15:52,950 --> 03:15:53,670
What are you talking about?

3885
03:15:54,050 --> 03:15:57,250
It ain't over till the fat lady...

3886
03:15:57,250 --> 03:15:59,570
It ain't over till the fat lady...

3887
03:15:59,570 --> 03:16:02,130
Oh, stamina?

3888
03:16:06,570 --> 03:16:07,330
Ah!

3889
03:16:07,590 --> 03:16:08,450
Ice cream!

3890
03:16:13,910 --> 03:16:14,670
We

3891
03:16:17,760 --> 03:16:18,840
made it!

3892
03:16:24,620 --> 03:16:25,160
We made it!

3893
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:26,020
Gamers don't look up.

3894
03:16:26,820 --> 03:16:29,660
Not gonna lie, completely forgot about that guy.

3895
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:32,260
He was like, Don't forget about me!

3896
03:16:33,140 --> 03:16:34,200
Creepy, creepy crawly.

3897
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:38,720
Because we've gotten the goop guy so many times.

3898
03:16:41,300 --> 03:16:43,520
I've completely forgotten about that guy.

3899
03:16:43,880 --> 03:16:46,520
The one I'm always not prepared for is the...

3900
03:16:49,280 --> 03:16:49,760
Oh!

3901
03:16:49,900 --> 03:16:50,120
Ah!

3902
03:16:50,420 --> 03:16:50,980
Oh my gosh.

3903
03:16:56,840 --> 03:16:57,560
Wait, wait, wait.

3904
03:16:57,680 --> 03:16:58,340
I went the wrong way.

3905
03:16:58,520 --> 03:16:59,580
I went the wrong way, please!

3906
03:17:07,100 --> 03:17:07,740
There he is.

3907
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:09,860
I'm always not prepared for...

3908
03:17:11,140 --> 03:17:11,820
the puppet.

3909
03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:18,500
This guy though, we can handle.

3910
03:17:18,500 --> 03:17:19,280
888!

3911
03:17:24,500 --> 03:17:28,100
I like how I realized I went the wrong way as I went the wrong way though.

3912
03:17:29,780 --> 03:17:30,420
Minto Gaming.

3913
03:17:37,570 --> 03:17:39,050
Have I died to the puppet yet?

3914
03:17:39,150 --> 03:17:41,730
No, but now I probably will.

3915
03:17:41,830 --> 03:17:42,930
Because I just jinxed myself.

3916
03:17:49,220 --> 03:17:52,020
Don't you want to look at the lovely starry night?

3917
03:17:54,820 --> 03:17:55,540
Bonk, bonk.

3918
03:17:55,640 --> 03:17:57,460
Oh, you didn't even knock that one.

3919
03:17:57,780 --> 03:17:59,100
You just...

3920
03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:05,200
Yeah, there are two knocks.

3921
03:18:05,540 --> 03:18:06,480
I think two knocks.

3922
03:18:06,500 --> 03:18:09,060
You can't just knock once and then expect someone to let you in.

3923
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:12,280
You know, you have to knock twice.

3924
03:18:13,700 --> 03:18:15,660
Give them a second to...

3925
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:18,460
to answer the door?

3926
03:18:19,900 --> 03:18:23,060
They might be, you know, on the toilet?

3927
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:25,400
I need a second, okay?

3928
03:18:32,850 --> 03:18:33,950
Do you want a bite?

3929
03:18:34,090 --> 03:18:34,690
You want a snack?

3930
03:18:34,850 --> 03:18:35,470
You want some ribs?

3931
03:18:38,350 --> 03:18:39,270
No, you're good?

3932
03:18:39,530 --> 03:18:41,150
He's like, I'm all ribs.

3933
03:18:43,850 --> 03:18:44,890
I'm only ribs.

3934
03:18:44,990 --> 03:18:45,450
Look at me.

3935
03:18:45,750 --> 03:18:46,550
Look at me, Minto.

3936
03:18:46,790 --> 03:18:47,950
How am I gonna eat ribs?

3937
03:18:48,470 --> 03:18:49,390
I'm all ribs.

3938
03:18:49,390 --> 03:18:49,550
I'm all ribs.

3939
03:18:51,530 --> 03:18:51,990
I'm sorry.

3940
03:18:56,170 --> 03:18:57,890
Can I get too far away from this guy?

3941
03:18:57,970 --> 03:18:58,930
He's really needy.

3942
03:18:59,770 --> 03:19:01,250
He's really, really needy.

3943
03:19:03,330 --> 03:19:04,650
Oh, don't get too far.

3944
03:19:04,730 --> 03:19:06,190
Okay, I thought there was gonna be a door right there.

3945
03:19:08,470 --> 03:19:10,070
That was my mistake.

3946
03:19:10,910 --> 03:19:12,010
Yeah, loop the music.

3947
03:19:12,090 --> 03:19:12,690
Loop the music.

3948
03:19:12,690 --> 03:19:13,290
You're still here.

3949
03:19:14,610 --> 03:19:15,330
And 900!

3950
03:19:21,220 --> 03:19:22,280
Oh, that's my footsteps.

3951
03:19:22,280 --> 03:19:24,460
Oh my god, I thought he was knocking.

3952
03:19:30,040 --> 03:19:31,280
What does that say?

3953
03:19:31,380 --> 03:19:35,880
This is the first time I've ever seen someone who knows that it's not over till the fat lady sings quote.

3954
03:19:36,240 --> 03:19:40,140
I sometimes say that to people when they say something it's over and they never get it.

3955
03:19:40,320 --> 03:19:40,760
Really?

3956
03:19:40,920 --> 03:19:43,620
I thought it was a common thing, right?

3957
03:19:44,660 --> 03:19:46,180
I thought he was knocking.

3958
03:19:46,800 --> 03:19:47,960
Oh my gosh.

3959
03:19:48,320 --> 03:19:50,320
We got 100 rooms left, everybody!

3960
03:19:51,320 --> 03:19:52,140
No!

3961
03:19:56,010 --> 03:19:58,500
Maybe people don't say it anymore, right?

3962
03:19:58,940 --> 03:20:00,740
It's just a common phrase.

3963
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:02,800
Is it because we're old?

3964
03:20:04,240 --> 03:20:05,360
Boomer phrase?

3965
03:20:06,280 --> 03:20:07,960
Definitely used to be common.

3966
03:20:09,500 --> 03:20:10,520
Oh, nice.

3967
03:20:10,920 --> 03:20:11,740
Straight!

3968
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:13,900
Donk!

3969
03:20:14,920 --> 03:20:15,740
Left!

3970
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:18,020
Left!

3971
03:20:19,160 --> 03:20:19,760
Left!

3972
03:20:20,420 --> 03:20:20,980
Left!

3973
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:25,220
Left, left, left, right!

3974
03:20:27,540 --> 03:20:28,100
Left!

3975
03:20:28,520 --> 03:20:28,840
Oh.

3976
03:20:29,420 --> 03:20:29,980
Straight!

3977
03:20:31,180 --> 03:20:32,080
Vinto Gaming!

3978
03:20:33,920 --> 03:20:37,100
Oh, it's really dark and dreary down here.

3979
03:20:41,270 --> 03:20:42,290
First try.

3980
03:20:43,110 --> 03:20:43,670
Craziness.

3981
03:20:47,090 --> 03:20:48,430
100 more pull-ups!

3982
03:20:48,710 --> 03:20:51,550
It's about opera and we don't opera as much as we used to.

3983
03:20:51,970 --> 03:20:52,650
I guess that's so true.

3984
03:20:59,070 --> 03:21:00,010
She's still going?

3985
03:21:00,170 --> 03:21:05,070
I didn't expect to finish the game today, but I don't know.

3986
03:21:05,110 --> 03:21:05,770
Maybe I will.

3987
03:21:06,050 --> 03:21:07,190
I mean, I'm not...

3988
03:21:07,190 --> 03:21:08,770
I mean, I think I will.

3989
03:21:08,870 --> 03:21:09,470
I'm at 900.

3990
03:21:09,870 --> 03:21:11,210
I might as well, right?

3991
03:21:13,070 --> 03:21:14,170
I might as well.

3992
03:21:18,950 --> 03:21:19,770
I think...

3993
03:21:19,770 --> 03:21:21,950
Unless there's like a secret, like...

3994
03:21:25,590 --> 03:21:28,510
You get to 1000, but it's not really...

3995
03:21:28,510 --> 03:21:29,070
Oh, gosh.

3996
03:21:31,550 --> 03:21:32,430
It's water.

3997
03:21:35,270 --> 03:21:36,670
Okay, what's the gimmick here?

3998
03:21:37,190 --> 03:21:37,830
Broken.

3999
03:21:38,450 --> 03:21:39,090
Oh!

4000
03:21:41,030 --> 03:21:41,670
Uh...

4001
03:21:43,550 --> 03:21:44,190
Researcher?

4002
03:21:45,310 --> 03:21:48,920
Oh, we're in the ocean.

4003
03:21:49,560 --> 03:21:51,300
Does anybody have athastasophobia?

4004
03:21:56,620 --> 03:22:01,180
Whale015D has died much sooner than I expected while I was away on holiday.

4005
03:22:01,440 --> 03:22:06,720
I regret not being here, but I had estimated it would live much longer.

4006
03:22:07,060 --> 03:22:18,080
The team that did the autopsy said nothing seemed to be wrong with the lungs, but the stomach had a circular hole about 2 feet in diameter all the way through to the outside of the whale.

4007
03:22:18,240 --> 03:22:21,020
This pretty much confirms a parasite is the cause of death.

4008
03:22:23,660 --> 03:22:24,900
Oh, not the whale.

4009
03:22:25,240 --> 03:22:26,460
This guy seems healthy.

4010
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:30,880
He seems alive and...

4011
03:22:30,880 --> 03:22:31,760
whale?

4012
03:22:39,390 --> 03:22:40,450
Researcher report 5.

4013
03:22:40,630 --> 03:22:43,250
The research facility is now in dire need of more engineers.

4014
03:22:43,590 --> 03:22:47,630
We had a whole block that is flooded, and some vital staff are missing.

4015
03:22:48,130 --> 03:22:48,610
Uh-oh.

4016
03:22:48,790 --> 03:22:49,990
I don't like that.

4017
03:23:02,320 --> 03:23:04,140
I don't know what to expect in here.

4018
03:23:04,320 --> 03:23:05,520
I'm truly scared.

4019
03:23:05,840 --> 03:23:07,080
It's too dark to see.

4020
03:23:08,840 --> 03:23:09,280
Okay.

4021
03:23:10,080 --> 03:23:11,980
That's never stopped us before, but sure.

4022
03:23:12,660 --> 03:23:14,460
We're reading these all out of order.

4023
03:23:14,740 --> 03:23:15,800
Yeah, amnesia time.

4024
03:23:15,860 --> 03:23:17,260
That's the vibes I'm getting now, too!

4025
03:23:17,900 --> 03:23:18,340
No!

4026
03:23:21,620 --> 03:23:26,200
Whale015A is still alive, but gets into fits of thrashing and is surfacing more often than natural.

4027
03:23:26,340 --> 03:23:31,800
I think there may be a problem with its lungs, but I don't have many tools that would allow me to check it without it dying.

4028
03:23:32,080 --> 03:23:35,620
I will have to allow it to die from whatever is causing it and then do an autopsy.

4029
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:36,480
Aww.

4030
03:23:37,740 --> 03:23:37,980
Oh.

4031
03:23:39,920 --> 03:23:41,900
Whale014D has strange small bite marks.

4032
03:23:42,060 --> 03:23:46,520
They appear from another smaller mammal, but the strangest thing about them is their placement.

4033
03:23:46,700 --> 03:23:52,400
They are in even rows inside the whale's stomach, all about 5 feet from the bottom of the stomach lining.

4034
03:23:53,440 --> 03:23:56,740
Okay, I'm reading these literally all out of order.

4035
03:23:58,280 --> 03:23:59,700
100% out of order.

4036
03:24:01,380 --> 03:24:01,920
Oh.

4037
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:03,500
It's gonna say, room with nothing in it?

4038
03:24:03,780 --> 03:24:05,180
Excerpt 4-132.

4039
03:24:05,440 --> 03:24:11,040
And then I watched carelessly as the sea rose above the sky, casting waving shadows over the world.

4040
03:24:11,140 --> 03:24:13,740
I saw the silhouettes of creatures both familiar and forgotten.

4041
03:24:14,020 --> 03:24:17,420
Suddenly, I found myself falling upwards towards an ocean of darkness.

4042
03:24:19,360 --> 03:24:19,900
Lantern?

4043
03:24:20,900 --> 03:24:21,440
Lantern?

4044
03:24:24,580 --> 03:24:25,700
There's a lantern in here?

4045
03:24:27,620 --> 03:24:28,160
Oh!

4046
03:24:28,260 --> 03:24:29,340
Oh my gosh.

4047
03:24:30,660 --> 03:24:32,240
It was too dark to see.

4048
03:24:36,940 --> 03:24:37,640
Oh, broken?

4049
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:41,480
Oh!

4050
03:24:42,840 --> 03:24:44,860
How am I supposed to do each one?

4051
03:24:45,320 --> 03:24:46,020
Oh, turn.

4052
03:24:46,300 --> 03:24:46,460
Okay.

4053
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:48,160
Wait, how do I turn it?

4054
03:24:49,640 --> 03:24:50,120
Oh!

4055
03:24:50,140 --> 03:24:50,600
There we go.

4056
03:24:50,680 --> 03:24:53,520
How I've been doing every action.

4057
03:24:53,720 --> 03:24:55,000
Is it 4-4-4-4?

4058
03:25:00,300 --> 03:25:01,260
Hehehe, spooky!

4059
03:25:08,180 --> 03:25:08,740
Read.

4060
03:25:09,580 --> 03:25:11,140
Research report number one.

4061
03:25:11,220 --> 03:25:13,240
More whales are being shipped to the facility tomorrow.

4062
03:25:13,560 --> 03:25:16,080
One for health inspection and two that already died...

4063
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:17,900
Oh, dead for autopsies.

4064
03:25:18,100 --> 03:25:23,060
More and more beached whales keep appearing around those islands, and I can't find what is causing it.

4065
03:25:24,400 --> 03:25:27,200
I always miss these notes that are on the ground.

4066
03:25:29,140 --> 03:25:29,980
The water

4067
03:25:33,020 --> 03:25:35,820
Oh, so the excerpt was... what was the number?

4068
03:26:22,010 --> 03:26:23,290
A siren?

4069
03:26:25,630 --> 03:26:27,610
I would fall for that.

4070
03:26:27,690 --> 03:26:29,330
Don't admit that so easily!

4071
03:26:29,870 --> 03:26:30,790
Oh gosh.

4072
03:26:33,190 --> 03:26:34,190
I'm scared.

4073
03:26:36,030 --> 03:26:37,950
The lantern got snuffed out.

4074
03:26:41,870 --> 03:26:44,090
Oh my gosh, this is actually amnesia!

4075
03:26:45,690 --> 03:26:46,290
No way.

4076
03:26:46,630 --> 03:26:47,590
Well, I know.

4077
03:26:47,810 --> 03:26:48,730
When something...

4078
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:49,630
is... around.

4079
03:26:52,150 --> 03:26:52,950
Well, I know.

4080
03:27:01,070 --> 03:27:02,730
I see like a trail.

4081
03:27:06,780 --> 03:27:08,420
And can it get me on here?

4082
03:27:08,600 --> 03:27:10,000
I'm gonna imagine not.

4083
03:27:10,220 --> 03:27:11,080
Because that would be unfair.

4084
03:27:12,800 --> 03:27:13,460
Oh gosh.

4085
03:27:16,760 --> 03:27:17,280
Eek!

4086
03:27:22,020 --> 03:27:22,980
Fish wife.

4087
03:27:25,860 --> 03:27:26,840
Oh, there's a note there.

4088
03:27:28,700 --> 03:27:29,920
All the staff is gone.

4089
03:27:30,160 --> 03:27:30,920
Only I remain.

4090
03:27:31,120 --> 03:27:34,380
For no purpose I remain here resisting the call from behind the sealed door.

4091
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:36,240
But I will remain as long as I can.

4092
03:27:36,620 --> 03:27:38,000
Don't open that door!

4093
03:27:38,540 --> 03:27:39,280
Is it this one?

4094
03:27:39,460 --> 03:27:40,200
I sure hope so.

4095
03:27:41,580 --> 03:27:43,180
Wait, was there a note in here that I missed?

4096
03:27:46,140 --> 03:27:47,700
Did I open the wrong...

4097
03:27:48,260 --> 03:27:49,180
Mister, which door?

4098
03:27:49,280 --> 03:27:51,020
Can you tell me which one?

4099
03:27:54,840 --> 03:27:55,260
Mister!

4100
03:27:56,480 --> 03:27:58,640
I think you have to say which door!

4101
03:28:00,900 --> 03:28:01,740
Open this one?

4102
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:03,880
Wait a second.

4103
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:05,560
Let's try this real quick.

4104
03:28:07,980 --> 03:28:09,580
Don't open that door!

4105
03:28:11,720 --> 03:28:13,000
Oh, I got a key.

4106
03:28:13,120 --> 03:28:15,460
Oh, and this is probably the key to open the door, isn't it?

4107
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:23,120
Am I gonna open it?

4108
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:25,000
And then like...

4109
03:28:25,860 --> 03:28:26,280
Eek!

4110
03:28:26,560 --> 03:28:26,980
Oh!

4111
03:28:27,620 --> 03:28:27,860
Oh!

4112
03:28:31,240 --> 03:28:32,240
Oh!

4113
03:28:34,780 --> 03:28:36,020
She's beautiful.

4114
03:28:36,320 --> 03:28:37,240
Wait a second!

4115
03:28:39,920 --> 03:28:41,600
I mean...

4116
03:28:44,780 --> 03:28:46,460
I mean...

4117
03:28:50,520 --> 03:28:51,700
Should I...

4118
03:28:52,980 --> 03:28:54,480
I think she's topless.

4119
03:28:54,880 --> 03:28:56,040
You guys!

4120
03:28:56,840 --> 03:28:59,460
You guys, I think she's topless though!

4121
03:29:12,530 --> 03:29:13,130
Madam!

4122
03:29:13,130 --> 03:29:16,490
You haven't seen her face?

4123
03:29:17,990 --> 03:29:19,030
Look at that!

4124
03:29:19,170 --> 03:29:20,890
Look at the assets!

4125
03:29:21,710 --> 03:29:23,590
I can see them from the fog!

4126
03:29:24,010 --> 03:29:26,010
I can see them through the fog!

4127
03:29:26,130 --> 03:29:27,030
What are you talking about?

4128
03:29:28,530 --> 03:29:29,630
The face?

4129
03:29:29,730 --> 03:29:30,090
Come on!

4130
03:29:32,610 --> 03:29:35,250
Eating mermaid flesh grants immortality?

4131
03:29:40,010 --> 03:29:41,050
If I...go...

4132
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:42,870
Is she gonna stay there?

4133
03:29:43,590 --> 03:29:44,110
Broken.

4134
03:29:55,070 --> 03:29:57,070
Is this like something trigger?

4135
03:29:57,270 --> 03:29:58,390
I'm nervous, you know?

4136
03:30:05,430 --> 03:30:06,310
She's still there.

4137
03:30:10,550 --> 03:30:12,090
I should look around first.

4138
03:30:12,790 --> 03:30:13,330
Okay.

4139
03:30:17,120 --> 03:30:18,140
Go closer?

4140
03:30:18,340 --> 03:30:19,120
Okay, okay, okay.

4141
03:30:20,240 --> 03:30:21,440
I'm being a little baby.

4142
03:30:22,380 --> 03:30:24,400
I am being a b-b-b-baby.

4143
03:30:38,300 --> 03:30:39,900
Oh, she's like camping.

4144
03:30:44,300 --> 03:30:45,200
No way.

4145
03:30:45,440 --> 03:30:47,100
Oh, she's camping-camping.

4146
03:30:49,940 --> 03:30:51,380
She wants you mint.

4147
03:30:59,350 --> 03:30:59,630
Wait!

4148
03:31:01,150 --> 03:31:01,730
Oh shit.

4149
03:31:01,850 --> 03:31:05,630
Oh my

4150
03:31:10,740 --> 03:31:11,640
god, oh my god, oh my...

4151
03:31:12,380 --> 03:31:13,760
Oh my god, oh my god.

4152
03:31:14,580 --> 03:31:15,920
Oh, she comes in through here?

4153
03:31:21,100 --> 03:31:21,960
She's down there?

4154
03:31:24,480 --> 03:31:25,500
Did it hurt a lot?

4155
03:31:28,340 --> 03:31:29,460
She's a little yandere?

4156
03:31:45,130 --> 03:31:48,870
I can't tell what she...oh, I think she came out and then turned around.

4157
03:31:53,890 --> 03:31:54,370
Nice.

4158
03:31:55,570 --> 03:31:57,430
The water is draining.

4159
03:31:59,890 --> 03:32:00,830
Nice, nice, nice.

4160
03:32:03,090 --> 03:32:05,730
Okay, this is the end of this area.

4161
03:32:06,890 --> 03:32:08,490
What are you doing, lovely?

4162
03:32:09,190 --> 03:32:11,130
Just ask around what's the worst that could happen.

4163
03:32:12,250 --> 03:32:13,610
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

4164
03:32:25,680 --> 03:32:26,740
That's what I'm saying.

4165
03:32:27,680 --> 03:32:28,800
Sure, we'll be fine.

4166
03:32:36,200 --> 03:32:39,240
Let's all wait for our health to regenerate.

4167
03:32:41,760 --> 03:32:43,200
She was fast.

4168
03:32:44,580 --> 03:32:46,560
I like an aggressive lady.

4169
03:32:47,740 --> 03:32:49,040
She's feisty, yeah.

4170
03:32:49,420 --> 03:32:50,840
Did it leave a hickey?

4171
03:32:51,360 --> 03:32:52,120
Yeah, yeah.

4172
03:32:53,420 --> 03:32:54,560
Calm down, everybody.

4173
03:32:54,820 --> 03:32:55,420
Calm down.

4174
03:32:59,410 --> 03:33:00,490
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

4175
03:33:00,970 --> 03:33:02,790
Oh, that was close, that was close, that was close.

4176
03:33:06,190 --> 03:33:08,450
She went that way, so I'm gonna go...

4177
03:33:10,030 --> 03:33:10,690
this way.

4178
03:33:13,850 --> 03:33:14,210
Yes?

4179
03:33:15,350 --> 03:33:17,590
She's drawing hearts in the water for me.

4180
03:33:19,050 --> 03:33:20,010
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

4181
03:33:20,230 --> 03:33:20,990
Oh, god.

4182
03:33:23,970 --> 03:33:25,630
At least she leaves this time.

4183
03:33:26,370 --> 03:33:26,890
You know?

4184
03:33:29,870 --> 03:33:31,610
You're not you when you're hungry.

4185
03:33:37,290 --> 03:33:38,390
Okay, I think I can make it.

4186
03:33:45,090 --> 03:33:45,490
9...

4187
03:33:47,090 --> 03:33:47,490
13...

4188
03:33:56,640 --> 03:34:01,020
Oh, oh, I was gonna say I should just go for it, but I'm glad I didn't.

4189
03:34:04,500 --> 03:34:06,140
Does she come back, I wonder?

4190
03:34:07,620 --> 03:34:10,840
These last rooms take a long time to clear.

4191
03:34:11,060 --> 03:34:11,600
I can imagine.

4192
03:34:15,780 --> 03:34:17,440
Does she come back?

4193
03:34:18,320 --> 03:34:20,200
Let's give it a second to see.

4194
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:24,540
Are you going to play the DLC?

4195
03:34:26,320 --> 03:34:29,360
Probably at some point, but not today.

4196
03:34:30,580 --> 03:34:33,000
I would like to at some point, but I think it would be fun.

4197
03:34:35,120 --> 03:34:36,500
I don't know where she is.

4198
03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:42,180
She sounds pretty far, though.

4199
03:34:47,390 --> 03:34:48,130
There she is.

4200
03:34:52,130 --> 03:34:53,770
This water doesn't look sanitary.

4201
03:34:54,790 --> 03:34:59,350
It's as cleanly as the Seine, which they will be swimming in for the Olympics.

4202
03:35:10,760 --> 03:35:11,840
Oh gosh!

4203
03:35:12,120 --> 03:35:14,560
I tried to juke her.

4204
03:35:15,740 --> 03:35:16,800
Get out of here!

4205
03:35:19,360 --> 03:35:20,900
Are you camping me again?

4206
03:35:22,100 --> 03:35:22,860
Wait, no.

4207
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:23,380
She turned around.

4208
03:35:26,280 --> 03:35:27,780
There she goes.

4209
03:35:29,480 --> 03:35:30,380
Love bite.

4210
03:35:34,100 --> 03:35:35,300
My first...

4211
03:35:38,900 --> 03:35:40,100
time with a mermaid.

4212
03:35:45,010 --> 03:35:46,110
There she is.

4213
03:35:47,750 --> 03:35:49,430
This is how we communicate.

4214
03:35:49,650 --> 03:35:51,690
She draws, you know, stuff in the water.

4215
03:35:52,870 --> 03:35:54,110
It's for me to read.

4216
03:35:54,310 --> 03:35:55,350
Little love notes.

4217
03:35:56,030 --> 03:35:57,710
She kind of looks like a slug.

4218
03:35:58,250 --> 03:35:59,430
She's not like...

4219
03:36:00,070 --> 03:36:02,270
above the water, you know?

4220
03:36:03,030 --> 03:36:05,050
Giving real sluggy energy here.

4221
03:36:11,680 --> 03:36:13,380
I didn't know where she was.

4222
03:36:13,800 --> 03:36:16,460
Where did she go actually?

4223
03:36:16,680 --> 03:36:18,100
I think she went down that way.

4224
03:36:20,460 --> 03:36:20,900
Okay.

4225
03:36:21,140 --> 03:36:21,540
Oof.

4226
03:36:25,100 --> 03:36:25,980
She backtracked.

4227
03:36:25,980 --> 03:36:26,560
That was about to go.

4228
03:36:28,860 --> 03:36:29,620
Where did she...

4229
03:36:29,620 --> 03:36:31,600
I think she went all the way down.

4230
03:36:34,220 --> 03:36:35,520
I think we're...

4231
03:36:35,520 --> 03:36:37,100
Not good.

4232
03:36:37,220 --> 03:36:37,560
Not good.

4233
03:36:37,620 --> 03:36:37,940
Not good.

4234
03:36:38,100 --> 03:36:39,540
Is she going to backtrack here again?

4235
03:36:40,940 --> 03:36:41,380
Yep.

4236
03:36:46,920 --> 03:36:47,360
Oh.

4237
03:36:51,540 --> 03:36:53,300
Half slug, half maid.

4238
03:36:53,520 --> 03:36:54,120
A mermaid.

4239
03:36:54,620 --> 03:36:56,280
I don't think that's how that works.

4240
03:36:57,400 --> 03:36:59,040
I don't think that's where the...

4241
03:36:59,640 --> 03:37:01,380
mer part comes...

4242
03:37:02,160 --> 03:37:02,680
from.

4243
03:37:03,220 --> 03:37:04,380
I might be wrong.

4244
03:37:15,200 --> 03:37:15,720
Okay.

4245
03:37:15,720 --> 03:37:17,860
So she can now go through under here.

4246
03:37:18,560 --> 03:37:20,060
I don't know where she is though.

4247
03:37:20,260 --> 03:37:20,780
So...

4248
03:37:20,780 --> 03:37:21,680
wrong.

4249
03:37:21,680 --> 03:37:22,580
Ah!!

4250
03:37:30,160 --> 03:37:31,480
You're absurd.

4251
03:37:32,400 --> 03:37:35,260
Hey, a slug girl is just a poor man's slime girl.

4252
03:37:36,320 --> 03:37:38,680
I wasn't hating on a slug girl.

4253
03:37:41,640 --> 03:37:43,940
I wouldn't discriminate...

4254
03:37:44,650 --> 03:37:45,480
monster girls.

4255
03:37:47,840 --> 03:37:49,560
I love monster girls.

4256
03:37:51,680 --> 03:37:52,520
Thanks for the dono.

4257
03:37:58,080 --> 03:38:01,720
She's sending me... she's saying triangle as in like, you know...

4258
03:38:02,160 --> 03:38:04,140
This isn't... bad, it's...

4259
03:38:04,140 --> 03:38:04,960
Oh my god.

4260
03:38:05,420 --> 03:38:07,860
It's not great... triangle.

4261
03:38:09,080 --> 03:38:13,240
Actually, she wants to listen to Triangle from Macross right now, that's what she's saying.

4262
03:38:28,020 --> 03:38:28,540
Wait.

4263
03:38:29,780 --> 03:38:30,760
That's not triangle.

4264
03:38:31,360 --> 03:38:32,900
I'm singing the rock song.

4265
03:38:37,640 --> 03:38:38,840
Triangle Dreamer.

4266
03:38:40,160 --> 03:38:41,580
She's a regular tri...

4267
03:38:43,120 --> 03:38:44,700
That's lion, yeah I know!

4268
03:38:45,140 --> 03:38:46,760
Wait, how does triangle go again?

4269
03:38:48,960 --> 03:38:53,220
Oh kimi wa dare to kisu wo sunu

4270
03:39:09,400 --> 03:39:12,400
I don't mind this one so much, it's just a matter of patience, you know?

4271
03:39:15,040 --> 03:39:16,380
At least I don't mind it right now.

4272
03:39:17,080 --> 03:39:18,260
Murphy brought up a great point.

4273
03:39:18,400 --> 03:39:20,180
What about mermaid maids?

4274
03:39:20,240 --> 03:39:21,940
And mer... man...

4275
03:39:25,020 --> 03:39:25,340
Maids...

4276
03:39:26,280 --> 03:39:26,600
Shush...

4277
03:39:28,680 --> 03:39:29,000
Um...

4278
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:30,320
Mermaid...

4279
03:39:31,400 --> 03:39:31,720
Mermaids...

4280
03:39:37,400 --> 03:39:39,700
Are you saying I should get a mermaid outfit?

4281
03:39:40,320 --> 03:39:41,760
Oh no, wait, which way do I go?

4282
03:39:43,200 --> 03:39:44,080
No, no, I don't know!

4283
03:39:44,400 --> 03:39:44,720
Oh.

4284
03:39:45,580 --> 03:39:46,020
Uh oh.

4285
03:39:46,360 --> 03:39:47,260
I don't know where to go.

4286
03:39:48,980 --> 03:39:49,900
Is this a dead end?

4287
03:39:49,960 --> 03:39:50,440
I can't tell!

4288
03:39:51,140 --> 03:39:51,640
Oh gosh.

4289
03:39:56,590 --> 03:39:57,550
Okay, there's a door here!

4290
03:39:58,410 --> 03:39:59,210
Hopefully it's okay!

4291
03:39:59,210 --> 03:39:59,450
Okay!

4292
03:40:02,810 --> 03:40:03,250
Yes!

4293
03:40:08,390 --> 03:40:08,830
Gosh.

4294
03:40:09,270 --> 03:40:10,890
How long does this last for?

4295
03:40:23,390 --> 03:40:23,830
Oh.

4296
03:40:23,910 --> 03:40:25,270
Wait, did I just go in a circle?

4297
03:40:30,790 --> 03:40:32,070
Oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

4298
03:40:36,900 --> 03:40:38,660
I didn't just go in a circle, did I?

4299
03:40:38,780 --> 03:40:39,220
No.

4300
03:40:39,740 --> 03:40:40,180
No.

4301
03:40:41,660 --> 03:40:42,120
No.

4302
03:40:42,120 --> 03:40:42,800
I think she's gone.

4303
03:40:43,940 --> 03:40:45,120
There it is, the door.

4304
03:41:01,580 --> 03:41:03,200
She just went that way.

4305
03:41:04,460 --> 03:41:05,740
Don't know where she went.

4306
03:41:05,820 --> 03:41:07,020
Oh, there she is.

4307
03:41:07,320 --> 03:41:08,260
Go through there.

4308
03:41:10,000 --> 03:41:10,460
No.

4309
03:41:10,600 --> 03:41:11,560
Go through the...

4310
03:41:11,560 --> 03:41:12,740
Go through the grate.

4311
03:41:17,880 --> 03:41:18,320
Okay.

4312
03:41:20,120 --> 03:41:21,000
Give it a second.

4313
03:41:21,120 --> 03:41:21,280
Yup.

4314
03:41:23,400 --> 03:41:24,760
Does she always...

4315
03:41:24,760 --> 03:41:25,920
Is she just like in a triangle?

4316
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:26,400
Oh.

4317
03:41:30,160 --> 03:41:30,600
Okay.

4318
03:41:31,560 --> 03:41:33,260
Again, she's sending me signals.

4319
03:41:35,480 --> 03:41:37,260
So when she comes back...

4320
03:41:37,260 --> 03:41:37,280
Oh.

4321
03:41:37,660 --> 03:41:38,100
Wait.

4322
03:41:38,220 --> 03:41:38,520
Oh.

4323
03:41:39,060 --> 03:41:41,740
That's different from the pattern that I've just been observing!

4324
03:41:45,180 --> 03:41:45,620
Go!

4325
03:41:51,870 --> 03:41:52,970
And she's left.

4326
03:41:53,190 --> 03:41:53,610
Okay.

4327
03:42:00,830 --> 03:42:03,370
She like, comes at me and then turns around.

4328
03:42:03,550 --> 03:42:04,130
So it's...

4329
03:42:04,130 --> 03:42:05,270
Makes it wait.

4330
03:42:09,570 --> 03:42:10,030
Hello!

4331
03:42:14,910 --> 03:42:16,230
Just gonna have to go for it?

4332
03:42:18,570 --> 03:42:19,370
Madam, please!

4333
03:42:21,770 --> 03:42:24,410
She is really quick and they're way less...

4334
03:42:24,410 --> 03:42:26,130
I don't even know where the next one is.

4335
03:42:37,040 --> 03:42:37,720
There's the door.

4336
03:42:41,560 --> 03:42:41,960
Oh!

4337
03:42:42,900 --> 03:42:43,660
Oh, my gosh!

4338
03:42:43,800 --> 03:42:44,180
Oh, my gosh!

4339
03:42:44,240 --> 03:42:44,640
Oh, my gosh!

4340
03:42:47,620 --> 03:42:48,820
Oh, my gosh!

4341
03:42:51,380 --> 03:42:54,020
Still not quite good, but...

4342
03:42:58,390 --> 03:42:59,190
Come on.

4343
03:42:59,190 --> 03:43:00,290
You can't go down any lower.

4344
03:43:01,970 --> 03:43:02,370
Okay.

4345
03:43:03,110 --> 03:43:04,010
Oh, there she is.

4346
03:43:04,510 --> 03:43:04,910
Okay.

4347
03:43:04,910 --> 03:43:05,010
This is a low-level tower.

4348
03:43:11,810 --> 03:43:15,550
Why didn't they at least let us see the baubles before we...

4349
03:43:20,950 --> 03:43:22,230
Okay, nice.

4350
03:43:25,690 --> 03:43:27,690
Yeah, I can't even see like the...

4351
03:43:28,430 --> 03:43:29,210
Oh my gosh.

4352
03:43:31,150 --> 03:43:34,310
Oh my god!

4353
03:43:35,050 --> 03:43:35,490
Oh...

4354
03:43:37,330 --> 03:43:38,570
Could've used a warning!

4355
03:43:42,110 --> 03:43:42,990
Holy cow!

4356
03:43:47,550 --> 03:43:49,330
I think this is a smaller room.

4357
03:43:50,030 --> 03:43:51,730
So it's a little bit trickier.

4358
03:43:51,990 --> 03:43:55,150
There she is, going back towards the crate that we need to get to.

4359
03:43:56,630 --> 03:43:58,070
No warning, going in raw.

4360
03:43:59,030 --> 03:43:59,970
Going in raw.

4361
03:44:07,600 --> 03:44:09,940
I was gonna say, I think from here we just run for it!

4362
03:44:12,940 --> 03:44:14,160
That one was tough.

4363
03:44:14,400 --> 03:44:15,900
That one was tough.

4364
03:44:16,580 --> 03:44:18,200
Holy cow, how much longer?

4365
03:44:23,720 --> 03:44:24,940
924, baby.

4366
03:44:26,540 --> 03:44:27,560
75 rooms?

4367
03:44:27,620 --> 03:44:28,020
No way.

4368
03:44:28,120 --> 03:44:29,660
We have to go through all the rooms?

4369
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:30,700
Like this?

4370
03:44:32,700 --> 03:44:33,260
Oh...

4371
03:44:33,880 --> 03:44:36,680
I thought... I really thought...

4372
03:44:37,440 --> 03:44:38,000
Oh...

4373
03:44:40,020 --> 03:44:42,240
This is... this is actually torture, yeah.

4374
03:44:47,430 --> 03:44:48,970
Did she... where'd she go?

4375
03:44:49,110 --> 03:44:49,450
Oh.

4376
03:44:56,740 --> 03:44:59,380
5 more rooms of this tops, actually?

4377
03:45:00,720 --> 03:45:03,540
Or are you... pulling my leg?

4378
03:45:08,920 --> 03:45:10,000
I can't tell.

4379
03:45:14,100 --> 03:45:15,180
Time sink?

4380
03:45:15,380 --> 03:45:18,140
I think the bladder level is more of a time sink than it is fun.

4381
03:45:18,140 --> 03:45:19,880
That's the... kind of the vibe I'm...

4382
03:45:19,880 --> 03:45:22,740
It's definitely... it is overstated to welcome, I think.

4383
03:45:23,880 --> 03:45:27,260
I've done more than enough rooms... of this.

4384
03:45:29,240 --> 03:45:29,680
Yeah.

4385
03:45:31,460 --> 03:45:34,680
I feel like it's kind of a good thing that it was...

4386
03:45:34,680 --> 03:45:37,080
That this is like in the home stretch of the game.

4387
03:45:37,700 --> 03:45:40,780
Because otherwise, I feel like this would filter a lot of people.

4388
03:45:42,120 --> 03:45:47,180
Like if... imagine if this was in like 300, I think I would have been like, nah, I think I'm good.

4389
03:45:48,760 --> 03:45:52,400
But at this point, you're so far in, you don't even... you're like, well...

4390
03:45:52,400 --> 03:45:54,880
I've made it this far, I can't just quit.

4391
03:45:56,340 --> 03:45:59,040
So it ends up becoming like a sunk cost fallacy.

4392
03:46:11,450 --> 03:46:13,510
I feel like so close, but so far.

4393
03:46:13,670 --> 03:46:17,490
Like I feel like any... any room... the next room will surely be it, you know?

4394
03:46:19,610 --> 03:46:23,510
Like you can't do this... you can't do this the whole... for 75 more rooms.

4395
03:46:23,870 --> 03:46:24,810
That'd be craziness.

4396
03:46:32,180 --> 03:46:32,620
Okay.

4397
03:46:32,980 --> 03:46:33,420
Okay.

4398
03:46:35,120 --> 03:46:36,580
Oh my gosh, please.

4399
03:46:39,620 --> 03:46:41,140
Please, let me out of this.

4400
03:46:44,940 --> 03:46:46,840
Let me out of this hellscape.

4401
03:46:47,280 --> 03:46:48,840
Bring me back to Arby's.

4402
03:46:53,940 --> 03:46:54,820
Oh, okay.

4403
03:46:54,920 --> 03:46:55,840
This is a dead end.

4404
03:46:55,860 --> 03:46:56,580
Of course it is.

4405
03:46:57,220 --> 03:46:58,220
Of course it is.

4406
03:47:03,600 --> 03:47:04,260
I need a break.

4407
03:47:04,440 --> 03:47:05,660
I'm not breaking up with you.

4408
03:47:05,700 --> 03:47:06,000
It's you.

4409
03:47:06,200 --> 03:47:06,940
It's not... I mean, it's me.

4410
03:47:06,980 --> 03:47:07,400
It's not you.

4411
03:47:08,760 --> 03:47:10,020
It's you, just a little bit.

4412
03:47:10,660 --> 03:47:13,900
But I just... I just need a bit of a break, please.

4413
03:47:15,520 --> 03:47:16,520
Yeah, go in there.

4414
03:47:17,360 --> 03:47:18,760
There's so much going on in there.

4415
03:47:29,540 --> 03:47:32,060
At some point, I'm just... I'm just going for it.

4416
03:47:32,120 --> 03:47:33,440
I'm like, I can't even be bothered.

4417
03:47:37,100 --> 03:47:37,540
Please.

4418
03:47:38,520 --> 03:47:40,520
Please, please put me out of my misery.

4419
03:47:42,760 --> 03:47:43,200
Girlfriend.

4420
03:47:46,480 --> 03:47:48,940
Maybe 9.30 will be the last of it.

4421
03:47:49,240 --> 03:47:50,340
I sure hope so.

4422
03:47:51,140 --> 03:47:52,520
Surely by 9.30.

4423
03:47:53,760 --> 03:47:54,500
Oh my gosh.

4424
03:47:55,440 --> 03:47:55,880
Oh.

4425
03:48:00,010 --> 03:48:01,830
I'm getting a little braver with it.

4426
03:48:01,870 --> 03:48:04,550
Actually, I don't know if it's bravery or impatience.

4427
03:48:06,290 --> 03:48:07,430
Oh my god.

4428
03:48:07,490 --> 03:48:07,710
Please.

4429
03:48:13,210 --> 03:48:14,470
Oh, that was close.

4430
03:48:24,370 --> 03:48:25,730
Thank you.

4431
03:48:25,890 --> 03:48:27,010
Welcome to membership.

4432
03:48:36,790 --> 03:48:37,550
No.

4433
03:49:05,500 --> 03:49:06,160
Girlfriend.

4434
03:49:10,660 --> 03:49:12,480
That was so close.

4435
03:49:15,110 --> 03:49:16,100
Oh gosh.

4436
03:49:25,460 --> 03:49:26,120
Yikes.

4437
03:49:28,860 --> 03:49:30,040
It's okay, she's leaving.

4438
03:49:30,640 --> 03:49:32,180
She wants you so bad.

4439
03:49:33,120 --> 03:49:33,780
Collegian.

4440
03:49:34,520 --> 03:49:36,680
Collegian, thank you so much for the birthday.

4441
03:49:37,980 --> 03:49:38,500
Oh.

4442
03:49:39,400 --> 03:49:40,240
I got it.

4443
03:49:40,300 --> 03:49:40,640
I got it.

4444
03:49:41,180 --> 03:49:42,020
Achievement marathon.

4445
03:49:42,060 --> 03:49:43,240
Just keep moving.

4446
03:49:44,640 --> 03:49:45,460
I'm trying.

4447
03:49:49,220 --> 03:49:50,540
Thank you so much.

4448
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:52,480
I really, really, really appreciate it.

4449
03:49:53,940 --> 03:49:54,740
Thank you.

4450
03:49:55,780 --> 03:49:57,240
You did a 50 earlier.

4451
03:49:58,500 --> 03:49:59,680
Thank you so much.

4452
03:50:03,420 --> 03:50:04,580
Just keep moving.

4453
03:50:04,660 --> 03:50:05,340
Says the game.

4454
03:50:05,940 --> 03:50:07,000
Just keep moving.

4455
03:50:11,980 --> 03:50:13,080
I'm just .

4456
03:50:13,080 --> 03:50:14,860
It's like a mosquito.

4457
03:50:15,200 --> 03:50:15,460
You know.

4458
03:50:15,560 --> 03:50:16,720
I'm just too tasty.

4459
03:50:18,800 --> 03:50:20,020
I'm too tasty.

4460
03:50:22,780 --> 03:50:24,280
That was so scary.

4461
03:50:24,500 --> 03:50:25,300
Behind me.

4462
03:50:27,560 --> 03:50:28,140
Ch

4463
03:50:33,310 --> 03:50:34,120
Choco -mint flavored.

4464
03:50:41,840 --> 03:50:42,760
There she go.

4465
03:50:43,020 --> 03:50:43,080
A poacher.

4466
03:50:45,680 --> 03:50:46,940
And there I go.

4467
03:50:47,820 --> 03:50:48,780
Oh my god.

4468
03:50:49,260 --> 03:50:51,600
I just want to have a word with the devs.

4469
03:50:54,520 --> 03:50:57,300
I just want to have a word with the devs, please.

4470
03:50:58,000 --> 03:51:01,340
There is at some point when something becomes too much.

4471
03:51:01,480 --> 03:51:03,060
It's not scary anymore.

4472
03:51:03,440 --> 03:51:04,540
It's just frustrating.

4473
03:51:06,120 --> 03:51:10,800
Literally like every... I feel like every indie horror game does this.

4474
03:51:10,800 --> 03:51:12,400
At some point, you know?

4475
03:51:14,480 --> 03:51:18,040
Every horror indie horror game has a part where it's just...

4476
03:51:19,400 --> 03:51:21,460
It has overstayed its welcome!

4477
03:51:24,120 --> 03:51:26,620
This section is... I'm so sorry, you guys.

4478
03:51:28,620 --> 03:51:29,940
I'm trying to make it entertaining.

4479
03:51:32,500 --> 03:51:33,020
Wait.

4480
03:51:34,960 --> 03:51:35,640
Hold on.

4481
03:51:35,780 --> 03:51:37,360
Let's wait for her to turn around.

4482
03:51:40,800 --> 03:51:42,480
Still made you jump?

4483
03:51:42,680 --> 03:51:45,520
Yeah, because she attacked me.

4484
03:51:46,240 --> 03:51:47,280
Please.

4485
03:51:47,680 --> 03:51:48,520
Please.

4486
03:51:49,300 --> 03:51:52,920
Oh my gosh.

4487
03:51:57,460 --> 03:51:59,880
According to WikiMermaid...

4488
03:51:59,880 --> 03:52:02,480
Ending... End to N30!

4489
03:52:04,920 --> 03:52:05,960
No...

4490
03:52:06,680 --> 03:52:07,200
What?

4491
03:52:07,200 --> 03:52:07,240
What?

4492
03:52:09,880 --> 03:52:11,260
It has to be... maybe...

4493
03:52:12,020 --> 03:52:12,540
N30...

4494
03:52:13,880 --> 03:52:14,400
9...

4495
03:52:14,400 --> 03:52:16,500
I said N as if like...

4496
03:52:16,500 --> 03:52:18,560
Because, you know, 9 starts with an N.

4497
03:52:21,140 --> 03:52:21,660
940.

4498
03:52:21,820 --> 03:52:22,600
Okay, 940.

4499
03:52:24,000 --> 03:52:25,660
You're the cutest ghostmate.

4500
03:52:25,900 --> 03:52:26,880
Oh, stop it.

4501
03:52:27,520 --> 03:52:30,020
Okay, how many ghostmates do you actually know, though?

4502
03:52:31,460 --> 03:52:35,200
Have you guys seen the latest Tantoquare pack?

4503
03:52:35,200 --> 03:52:36,820
Have you seen...

4504
03:52:36,820 --> 03:52:40,540
If you have not seen the latest Tantoquare pack...

4505
03:52:40,540 --> 03:52:43,200
I'm kind of just like...

4506
03:52:45,940 --> 03:52:48,140
I'm like side-eyeing it a little bit.

4507
03:52:48,340 --> 03:52:50,020
Because it's literally free!

4508
03:52:57,020 --> 03:53:00,740
Wait, but the water went down!

4509
03:53:00,860 --> 03:53:01,340
There's more!

4510
03:53:03,200 --> 03:53:05,160
Tantoquare is a...

4511
03:53:06,280 --> 03:53:07,460
Is a...

4512
03:53:08,460 --> 03:53:10,400
A made card game.

4513
03:53:20,120 --> 03:53:20,960
940, right?

4514
03:53:31,960 --> 03:53:33,380
Let's let... I'm gonna let my...

4515
03:53:33,380 --> 03:53:35,020
Me heal again, just in case.

4516
03:53:37,540 --> 03:53:39,900
Looks like an old Edo game with that art style.

4517
03:53:40,520 --> 03:53:41,740
Isn't that the best, though?

4518
03:53:42,880 --> 03:53:43,360
Love...

4519
03:53:43,360 --> 03:53:44,760
Please, please, please, please.

4520
03:53:48,560 --> 03:53:50,480
Oh my god, I didn't realize she was right there.

4521
03:53:52,620 --> 03:53:54,860
No, no, no, no.

4522
03:53:54,980 --> 03:53:59,500
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

4523
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:04,340
Why does it keep going?

4524
03:54:07,640 --> 03:54:09,920
I'm gonna look at the new expansion pack.

4525
03:54:10,020 --> 03:54:10,860
I love Tantoquare.

4526
03:54:12,600 --> 03:54:13,100
Yeah.

4527
03:54:13,100 --> 03:54:13,200
Yeah.

4528
03:54:24,280 --> 03:54:26,500
I forgot how to play this game now.

4529
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:28,000
I'm not gonna lie.

4530
03:54:28,260 --> 03:54:30,960
We were in there for so long, I forgot how to play normally.

4531
03:54:33,640 --> 03:54:34,800
Oh my gosh.

4532
03:54:35,240 --> 03:54:36,040
It's the brain.

4533
03:54:37,840 --> 03:54:38,860
Oh my gosh.

4534
03:54:39,920 --> 03:54:40,400
Freedom!

4535
03:54:43,180 --> 03:54:43,900
Freedom!

4536
03:54:43,900 --> 03:54:44,620
Freedom!

4537
03:54:47,340 --> 03:54:52,700
Oh my gosh.

4538
03:54:56,740 --> 03:54:59,480
Mr. Obese, thank you so much for the 50!

4539
03:55:00,420 --> 03:55:01,500
Thank you!

4540
03:55:06,980 --> 03:55:13,200
But I'm kind of more nervous now because at least with...

4541
03:55:14,780 --> 03:55:17,440
At least with the mermaid, it was predictable, you know what I mean?

4542
03:55:17,840 --> 03:55:19,420
Now I'm just like, what's gonna happen?

4543
03:55:20,040 --> 03:55:21,200
But just 50 left.

4544
03:55:31,160 --> 03:55:33,040
I would love a save right now.

4545
03:55:33,120 --> 03:55:33,980
I know, right?

4546
03:55:34,080 --> 03:55:34,340
Gosh.

4547
03:55:37,200 --> 03:55:38,080
Oh, gosh.

4548
03:55:55,270 --> 03:55:56,470
I'm our wispy friend.

4549
03:55:58,030 --> 03:55:58,470
Oh!

4550
03:55:58,470 --> 03:55:59,650
We're back here.

4551
03:56:02,630 --> 03:56:03,030
Specimen.

4552
03:56:06,430 --> 03:56:07,630
Did we do 12 before?

4553
03:56:08,330 --> 03:56:09,250
Oh, the mansion.

4554
03:56:09,350 --> 03:56:09,730
That's right.

4555
03:56:11,010 --> 03:56:12,230
Oh yeah, we went in here.

4556
03:56:12,290 --> 03:56:13,250
Wait, so there's nothing else?

4557
03:56:14,770 --> 03:56:15,170
There's...

4558
03:56:15,170 --> 03:56:17,110
They don't even have a thing on the mermaid.

4559
03:56:19,410 --> 03:56:19,810
Right?

4560
03:56:22,510 --> 03:56:22,910
Huh.

4561
03:56:26,680 --> 03:56:27,480
This one...

4562
03:56:27,480 --> 03:56:28,520
What is this one?

4563
03:56:28,660 --> 03:56:29,400
Have I seen this one?

4564
03:56:29,400 --> 03:56:30,480
I have no idea.

4565
03:56:36,320 --> 03:56:37,500
She's just visiting.

4566
03:56:38,580 --> 03:56:39,240
Dang it.

4567
03:56:40,060 --> 03:56:40,580
Oops.

4568
03:56:45,540 --> 03:56:46,100
There we go.

4569
03:56:47,980 --> 03:56:49,460
Should be specimen 13.

4570
03:56:50,600 --> 03:56:51,860
No, there isn't one.

4571
03:57:01,360 --> 03:57:02,960
I don't know which one it is.

4572
03:57:03,300 --> 03:57:03,820
Wait.

4573
03:57:06,020 --> 03:57:06,780
This guy!

4574
03:57:08,280 --> 03:57:09,720
I don't like the sound he makes.

4575
03:57:10,500 --> 03:57:12,380
I really don't like the sound he makes.

4576
03:57:12,440 --> 03:57:12,980
It's so scary.

4577
03:57:20,720 --> 03:57:21,700
Just some guy.

4578
03:57:22,360 --> 03:57:23,580
Yeah, he can smell me.

4579
03:57:23,760 --> 03:57:25,040
He can hear me.

4580
03:57:25,260 --> 03:57:26,440
He can see me.

4581
03:57:26,880 --> 03:57:27,920
He can see...

4582
03:57:27,920 --> 03:57:28,700
Oh my gosh.

4583
03:57:35,280 --> 03:57:35,940
Sniffle Mambo.

4584
03:57:35,940 --> 03:57:41,760
He says, where are you?

4585
03:57:41,940 --> 03:57:42,460
I don't know.

4586
03:57:43,440 --> 03:57:44,480
Is that what he's doing?

4587
03:57:45,760 --> 03:57:47,860
He's so obsessed with me!

4588
03:57:50,860 --> 03:57:53,080
Oh, I think we made it through.

4589
03:57:57,660 --> 03:57:58,700
9.69!

4590
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:06,660
A different kind of room.

4591
03:58:08,660 --> 03:58:10,280
Really threw me off for a second.

4592
03:58:14,440 --> 03:58:15,820
Oh, goodness gracious.

4593
03:58:20,210 --> 03:58:21,230
We're so close.

4594
03:58:21,270 --> 03:58:21,730
What is this?

4595
03:58:21,770 --> 03:58:22,250
New music?

4596
03:58:23,270 --> 03:58:25,750
Horror of a dude with at least three senses.

4597
03:58:28,730 --> 03:58:30,670
He'll never get the fifth sense.

4598
03:58:30,950 --> 03:58:31,810
He'll never...

4599
03:58:31,810 --> 03:58:32,610
Oh, wait.

4600
03:58:32,870 --> 03:58:33,310
Oh.

4601
03:58:34,750 --> 03:58:35,610
Oh, it's this guy.

4602
03:58:35,730 --> 03:58:35,910
Okay.

4603
03:58:38,170 --> 03:58:39,810
I forgot he busts down the door.

4604
03:58:40,670 --> 03:58:41,210
Okay.

4605
03:58:45,210 --> 03:58:48,330
Oh, you're too weak to deal with the bridge?

4606
03:58:50,730 --> 03:58:51,430
Knock, knock.

4607
03:58:54,830 --> 03:58:56,350
What was I gonna say?

4608
03:58:56,590 --> 03:58:57,190
Oh, yeah.

4609
03:58:57,250 --> 03:59:00,230
He'll never reach the last one, which is touch.

4610
03:59:09,110 --> 03:59:09,650
Okay.

4611
03:59:10,350 --> 03:59:11,350
20 left!

4612
03:59:18,230 --> 03:59:19,270
Or taste.

4613
03:59:19,570 --> 03:59:19,970
Oh, yeah.

4614
03:59:20,070 --> 03:59:20,490
You're right.

4615
03:59:20,670 --> 03:59:22,130
He'll never taste me alive!

4616
03:59:33,030 --> 03:59:34,910
Tom and Jerry has reaction!

4617
03:59:35,490 --> 03:59:36,190
Shut up!

4618
03:59:36,530 --> 03:59:36,970
Oh, my God.

4619
03:59:37,030 --> 03:59:37,430
What was that?

4620
03:59:38,610 --> 03:59:40,830
What was that on the... on the right side?

4621
03:59:41,030 --> 03:59:41,830
I don't even want to know.

4622
03:59:49,990 --> 03:59:52,250
She really mastered the goofy impression.

4623
03:59:52,730 --> 03:59:53,530
What impression?

4624
03:59:56,350 --> 03:59:57,710
Are you calling me goofy?

4625
03:59:59,690 --> 04:00:00,890
Let's go to the left this time.

4626
04:00:07,010 --> 04:00:07,770
8!

4627
04:00:13,280 --> 04:00:13,660
7!

4628
04:00:15,740 --> 04:00:16,500
6!

4629
04:00:19,460 --> 04:00:20,220
5!

4630
04:00:22,320 --> 04:00:23,460
Why is it...

4631
04:00:24,220 --> 04:00:25,560
GL Labs!

4632
04:00:26,160 --> 04:00:28,800
Wait, why is it giving me a save of 5 left?

4633
04:00:30,160 --> 04:00:32,240
Keep that blood pumping!

4634
04:00:33,220 --> 04:00:33,780
Wait!

4635
04:00:39,750 --> 04:00:41,870
5 more, but why do we have a save?

4636
04:00:43,070 --> 04:00:43,890
I'm scared!

4637
04:00:44,530 --> 04:00:45,890
This seems ominous.

4638
04:00:47,030 --> 04:00:47,830
Extremely so.

4639
04:00:50,630 --> 04:00:51,710
But we saved!

4640
04:00:52,350 --> 04:00:55,170
So I feel a little less... bad.

4641
04:00:56,190 --> 04:00:57,150
Here we go.

4642
04:00:57,470 --> 04:00:58,290
What do you mean by that?

4643
04:01:03,950 --> 04:01:06,010
I don't know what to expect at all.

4644
04:01:07,890 --> 04:01:10,150
Especially considering the fact that...

4645
04:01:12,930 --> 04:01:14,310
That's the halfway point.

4646
04:01:15,250 --> 04:01:16,570
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

4647
04:01:16,650 --> 04:01:16,910
Nope.

4648
04:01:18,830 --> 04:01:20,890
I'm scared when you guys say that!

4649
04:01:23,070 --> 04:01:23,590
3?

4650
04:01:28,600 --> 04:01:29,120
2?

4651
04:01:37,140 --> 04:01:38,120
What's gonna happen?

4652
04:01:42,420 --> 04:01:43,840
Go towards the light!

4653
04:01:50,540 --> 04:01:51,260
What light?

4654
04:01:57,900 --> 04:01:58,400
Literally?

4655
04:02:02,000 --> 04:02:02,920
Oh, axe!

4656
04:02:03,120 --> 04:02:03,940
I forgot I had it!

4657
04:02:08,760 --> 04:02:09,260
Yippee!

4658
04:02:13,430 --> 04:02:16,090
The world is so much cuter than I thought it would be!

4659
04:02:22,550 --> 04:02:24,230
I can't go around the building.

4660
04:02:27,880 --> 04:02:29,440
Oh my gosh, window XP!

4661
04:02:30,820 --> 04:02:31,600
Bye bye!

4662
04:02:32,220 --> 04:02:34,180
Oh, I don't know if I'm trapped in here.

4663
04:02:39,780 --> 04:02:41,080
Is that me?

4664
04:02:46,500 --> 04:02:47,700
Portal moment?

4665
04:02:48,300 --> 04:02:48,760
You made it.

4666
04:02:49,260 --> 04:02:49,860
Congratulations.

4667
04:02:50,640 --> 04:02:51,480
I guess.

4668
04:02:53,000 --> 04:02:54,200
Uh, well...

4669
04:02:59,830 --> 04:03:02,090
So now you must pass one final test.

4670
04:03:02,350 --> 04:03:03,250
Prove your...

4671
04:03:03,250 --> 04:03:04,390
...cruelty to the door.

4672
04:03:07,290 --> 04:03:08,350
What's that sound?

4673
04:03:09,350 --> 04:03:10,050
Oh!

4674
04:03:15,730 --> 04:03:16,770
Or something!

4675
04:03:21,640 --> 04:03:23,080
I have no stamina.

4676
04:03:27,900 --> 04:03:29,300
Okay.

4677
04:03:35,440 --> 04:03:38,080
I still have the axe.

4678
04:03:53,420 --> 04:03:54,300
731?

4679
04:03:54,980 --> 04:03:56,380
731.

4680
04:03:59,180 --> 04:04:00,660
What the hell was that?

4681
04:04:01,460 --> 04:04:02,340
Sorry.

4682
04:04:02,640 --> 04:04:03,700
Is this your room?

4683
04:04:04,020 --> 04:04:10,740
Oh, it's this guy!

4684
04:04:12,080 --> 04:04:12,520
Oh!

4685
04:04:14,120 --> 04:04:14,560
Oh!

4686
04:04:15,280 --> 04:04:15,720
Oh!

4687
04:04:16,060 --> 04:04:16,700
Oh!

4688
04:04:17,860 --> 04:04:18,740
Oh!

4689
04:04:21,480 --> 04:04:22,360
Oh!

4690
04:04:22,460 --> 04:04:23,300
Oh!

4691
04:04:23,300 --> 04:04:23,920
Oh!

4692
04:04:24,320 --> 04:04:25,200
Oh!

4693
04:04:38,860 --> 04:04:39,380
Oh!

4694
04:04:39,380 --> 04:04:39,780
What are you gonna do?

4695
04:04:39,900 --> 04:04:40,380
What are you gonna do?

4696
04:04:43,800 --> 04:04:45,300
You won't take me!

4697
04:04:51,480 --> 04:04:52,460
Come down here!

4698
04:04:52,940 --> 04:04:53,460
You...

4699
04:04:53,460 --> 04:04:54,580
You coward!

4700
04:05:03,510 --> 04:05:04,450
Bloody, bloody!

4701
04:05:05,890 --> 04:05:06,410
Yeah,

4702
04:05:16,360 --> 04:05:17,120
I can't jump.

4703
04:05:18,680 --> 04:05:20,120
Use the BFG.

4704
04:05:22,260 --> 04:05:24,980
How am I

4705
04:05:39,310 --> 04:05:39,970
supposed to get him?

4706
04:05:41,390 --> 04:05:42,770
He's like squirming.

4707
04:05:55,740 --> 04:05:56,860
He's doing hands.

4708
04:05:56,960 --> 04:05:58,340
He's getting handsy with me.

4709
04:06:02,580 --> 04:06:03,140
Oh!

4710
04:06:03,140 --> 04:06:04,080
Oh, that one hurt me.

4711
04:06:04,220 --> 04:06:04,660
Ouch.

4712
04:06:05,320 --> 04:06:07,480
Oh, can I, um, maybe...

4713
04:06:07,480 --> 04:06:08,020
Oh,

4714
04:06:11,450 --> 04:06:11,790
nice!

4715
04:06:18,960 --> 04:06:19,840
Take that!

4716
04:06:43,160 --> 04:06:43,700
Here we go.

4717
04:06:43,760 --> 04:06:44,100
Here we go.

4718
04:06:44,120 --> 04:06:44,440
Here we go.

4719
04:06:48,930 --> 04:06:49,250
Yeah!

4720
04:07:00,640 --> 04:07:01,160
What's happening?

4721
04:07:01,560 --> 04:07:02,000
Uh-oh.

4722
04:07:02,640 --> 04:07:03,160
What does

4723
04:07:09,320 --> 04:07:10,200
it take to kill this guy?

4724
04:07:19,450 --> 04:07:19,770
Yeah.

4725
04:07:21,090 --> 04:07:21,410
Handsy.

4726
04:07:21,850 --> 04:07:22,370
Handsy bastard!

4727
04:07:26,630 --> 04:07:26,950
Oh!

4728
04:07:27,110 --> 04:07:28,550
I don't think I can reflect this one.

4729
04:07:28,550 --> 04:07:29,510
I'm assuming.

4730
04:07:29,810 --> 04:07:31,650
I'm assuming I cannot reflect that one.

4731
04:07:32,610 --> 04:07:33,530
But I will try.

4732
04:07:34,850 --> 04:07:35,410
This one!

4733
04:08:04,890 --> 04:08:06,630
Now there's probably gonna be like five guys!

4734
04:08:07,750 --> 04:08:08,570
Four guys!

4735
04:08:09,970 --> 04:08:10,610
Close enough!

4736
04:08:12,550 --> 04:08:13,150
Ouchie, ouchie.

4737
04:08:13,670 --> 04:08:15,670
Okay, this one probably I can't reflect then, right?

4738
04:08:15,810 --> 04:08:16,010
Yeah.

4739
04:08:16,210 --> 04:08:19,870
Oh, when it's red!

4740
04:08:20,750 --> 04:08:21,730
Okay, okay, okay.

4741
04:08:21,950 --> 04:08:22,790
I think I get it.

4742
04:08:23,230 --> 04:08:23,670
Cool.

4743
04:08:24,770 --> 04:08:25,170
It's

4744
04:08:29,700 --> 04:08:30,860
cool when it's red, right?

4745
04:08:30,960 --> 04:08:32,860
Only when it's not red?

4746
04:08:43,120 --> 04:08:43,520
Damn!

4747
04:08:43,880 --> 04:08:44,760
Oh, nice!

4748
04:08:45,040 --> 04:08:45,440
Nice!

4749
04:08:45,680 --> 04:08:46,660
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4750
04:08:47,440 --> 04:08:49,260
Okay, I have to be careful with this one, though.

4751
04:08:50,120 --> 04:08:50,520
Okay.

4752
04:08:52,560 --> 04:08:52,960
Oh!

4753
04:08:53,140 --> 04:08:53,820
Oh, no, no, no, no!

4754
04:08:54,100 --> 04:08:54,500
No!

4755
04:08:55,840 --> 04:08:57,380
I missed my chance!

4756
04:08:57,940 --> 04:08:58,200
Oh!

4757
04:08:59,280 --> 04:08:59,860
No!

4758
04:09:02,040 --> 04:09:02,700
That's me.

4759
04:09:03,420 --> 04:09:04,460
That's me right now.

4760
04:09:14,570 --> 04:09:15,150
Okay.

4761
04:09:16,090 --> 04:09:16,970
These guys.

4762
04:09:19,450 --> 04:09:22,430
That would help if I actually could hit them.

4763
04:09:23,490 --> 04:09:24,590
Oh, please.

4764
04:09:28,190 --> 04:09:28,770
Hit

4765
04:09:34,840 --> 04:09:35,820
it when it's red.

4766
04:09:35,840 --> 04:09:36,080
It's fine.

4767
04:09:36,160 --> 04:09:36,320
Oh!

4768
04:09:36,820 --> 04:09:37,640
I didn't eat it.

4769
04:09:37,640 --> 04:09:37,820
Me too.

4770
04:09:39,520 --> 04:09:40,040
Yippee!

4771
04:09:46,330 --> 04:09:46,850
Silence!

4772
04:09:47,550 --> 04:09:50,690
Well, you died.

4773
04:09:51,330 --> 04:09:53,110
In a pretty tragic way, too.

4774
04:09:53,670 --> 04:09:54,010
I did?

4775
04:09:54,130 --> 04:09:56,230
Just tragic enough for you to become a ghost.

4776
04:09:57,190 --> 04:09:59,470
Good job, by the way, making it this far.

4777
04:10:00,110 --> 04:10:01,190
So, buckle up, soldier.

4778
04:10:01,490 --> 04:10:04,650
Because now, I finally think we have enough troops to invade.

4779
04:10:06,430 --> 04:10:06,950
I'm...

4780
04:10:06,950 --> 04:10:07,950
Where are we going?

4781
04:10:08,370 --> 04:10:08,890
Oh!

4782
04:10:10,090 --> 04:10:10,610
Oh!

4783
04:10:10,870 --> 04:10:11,390
Oh!

4784
04:10:12,010 --> 04:10:13,350
Are we invading heaven?

4785
04:10:14,550 --> 04:10:15,670
What are we invading?

4786
04:10:15,790 --> 04:10:15,970
I...

4787
04:10:15,970 --> 04:10:16,190
I...

4788
04:10:16,190 --> 04:10:17,170
I died after all that!

4789
04:10:17,490 --> 04:10:19,050
The time has come, my loyal troops.

4790
04:10:19,610 --> 04:10:20,110
Tell us,

4791
04:10:24,300 --> 04:10:26,120
will we be disregarded and ignored?

4792
04:10:27,060 --> 04:10:30,360
For now, we are the most feared army in the world.

4793
04:10:30,780 --> 04:10:31,220
MSF!

4794
04:10:38,190 --> 04:10:40,610
Did you really think it was going to end seriously?

4795
04:10:42,730 --> 04:10:43,550
What do you mean, you'll

4796
04:10:46,740 --> 04:10:47,040
win?

4797
04:11:10,600 --> 04:11:11,300
I can...

4798
04:11:11,300 --> 04:11:12,340
I can speed it up.

4799
04:11:12,380 --> 04:11:12,720
Sorry.

4800
04:11:12,840 --> 04:11:13,600
Sorry, developers.

4801
04:11:14,240 --> 04:11:14,680
I can...

4802
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:16,100
Ahahaha!

4803
04:11:16,120 --> 04:11:16,820
That's so evil!

4804
04:11:26,550 --> 04:11:27,050
Wow!

4805
04:11:27,410 --> 04:11:28,150
There's a bunch...

4806
04:11:28,150 --> 04:11:30,030
There's a couple names in here that I recognize.

4807
04:11:31,150 --> 04:11:32,190
That's so silly.

4808
04:11:36,570 --> 04:11:37,070
Aw...

4809
04:11:40,640 --> 04:11:41,140
Vinesauce!

4810
04:11:41,860 --> 04:11:43,260
Matara has been talking to that guy.

4811
04:11:44,200 --> 04:11:44,700
Spank!

4812
04:11:44,700 --> 04:11:45,700
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

4813
04:11:48,600 --> 04:11:49,100
Shoutouts...

4814
04:11:49,100 --> 04:11:50,720
Shoutouts to vinesauce.

4815
04:11:50,960 --> 04:11:51,240
Haha!

4816
04:11:52,780 --> 04:11:53,280
Bukkake!

4817
04:11:54,760 --> 04:11:59,200
If you're too violent and break things with the axe too much, instead of the ghost ending, you become a specimen yourself.

4818
04:11:59,500 --> 04:12:01,340
Ah, I see, I see.

4819
04:12:01,880 --> 04:12:03,460
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted!

4820
04:12:04,980 --> 04:12:05,940
Funny ghost maid?

4821
04:12:06,060 --> 04:12:06,240
No!

4822
04:12:06,620 --> 04:12:08,560
No longer will we be called funny!

4823
04:12:09,360 --> 04:12:10,080
Or cute!

4824
04:12:10,340 --> 04:12:11,000
We will invade!

4825
04:12:16,400 --> 04:12:17,300
We will invade!

4826
04:12:19,120 --> 04:12:25,820
It's funny because when Matara was just like, Oh yeah, I collabed with a guy named Vinesauce the other day.

4827
04:12:25,920 --> 04:12:28,520
Like the first time she collabed with him, I was just like, What?

4828
04:12:28,760 --> 04:12:30,080
You collabed with Vinny?

4829
04:12:30,300 --> 04:12:31,940
She was like, yeah, I don't know who that is.

4830
04:12:32,040 --> 04:12:33,500
And I was like, this is...

4831
04:12:33,500 --> 04:12:35,140
Are we in a parallel universe?

4832
04:12:35,280 --> 04:12:38,140
Where I know who someone is and you don't know who someone is?

4833
04:12:48,320 --> 04:12:49,340
That was funny.

4834
04:12:53,760 --> 04:12:54,720
Felt like that too.

4835
04:12:55,060 --> 04:12:56,000
I was like, what?

4836
04:12:56,000 --> 04:12:57,800
I feel like Matara is lying.

4837
04:12:57,880 --> 04:12:58,700
She should know who Vinny...

4838
04:12:58,700 --> 04:12:59,900
No, she said she didn't know.

4839
04:13:00,280 --> 04:13:02,420
But I was like, you know every Twitch person.

4840
04:13:03,780 --> 04:13:05,280
GG, funny and cute ghost.

4841
04:13:05,440 --> 04:13:05,680
No!

4842
04:13:06,260 --> 04:13:08,880
No longer will we be called funny or cute!

4843
04:13:10,620 --> 04:13:11,580
We are...

4844
04:13:11,580 --> 04:13:13,820
We are the ghost revolution!

4845
04:13:14,400 --> 04:13:15,360
This music...

4846
04:13:15,360 --> 04:13:16,140
Okay, hold on.

4847
04:13:16,720 --> 04:13:17,800
What was a...

4848
04:13:18,780 --> 04:13:20,060
Was it under options?

4849
04:13:21,360 --> 04:13:22,940
That the music was kinda chill?

4850
04:13:23,560 --> 04:13:24,040
Yeah.

4851
04:13:24,040 --> 04:13:25,680
I like the music here.

4852
04:13:28,720 --> 04:13:30,860
Can't wait to see you lead the ghost revolution.

4853
04:13:31,200 --> 04:13:33,820
Fun game, even if the water level overstayed its welcome.

4854
04:13:34,220 --> 04:13:35,800
Yeah, no, still really fun.

4855
04:13:36,320 --> 04:13:37,980
Oh my gosh, frog, please, your wallet.

4856
04:13:38,540 --> 04:13:40,200
Thank you for the 50!

4857
04:13:41,980 --> 04:13:43,160
Thank you so much.

4858
04:13:43,900 --> 04:13:45,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4859
04:13:47,780 --> 04:13:48,660
Are you okay?

4860
04:13:48,740 --> 04:13:49,440
Your wallet though.

4861
04:13:50,240 --> 04:13:52,560
Congrats on beating the game, funny and cute ghost.

4862
04:13:52,560 --> 04:13:52,740
No, stop!

4863
04:13:58,900 --> 04:13:59,500
Funny?

4864
04:13:59,940 --> 04:14:00,540
Cute?

4865
04:14:01,520 --> 04:14:03,100
You got the wrong guy.

4866
04:14:08,250 --> 04:14:11,430
I don't think I've ever been funny and cute in my life.

4867
04:14:14,330 --> 04:14:15,890
You got the wrong guy.

4868
04:14:23,290 --> 04:14:24,470
I'm just clowning around.

4869
04:14:26,270 --> 04:14:27,950
What does crowd control do?

4870
04:14:28,750 --> 04:14:29,870
What's crowd control?

4871
04:14:31,850 --> 04:14:32,750
Wait, in the...

4872
04:14:33,470 --> 04:14:34,610
Oh, crowd control.

4873
04:14:35,070 --> 04:14:36,110
I see it.

4874
04:14:39,170 --> 04:14:40,390
That's a great question.

4875
04:14:43,470 --> 04:14:44,050
Disconnected.

4876
04:14:44,890 --> 04:14:49,290
Crowd control allows twitch.tv viewers to influence the game while broadcasting.

4877
04:14:50,970 --> 04:14:53,170
Why is it only twitch.tv?

4878
04:14:54,350 --> 04:14:59,010
Note that crowd control is less effective in Karamari Hospital and the Dollhouse.

4879
04:15:00,090 --> 04:15:00,990
Only twi...

4880
04:15:00,990 --> 04:15:02,650
This is the only good thing about twitch.

4881
04:15:03,670 --> 04:15:05,550
Is you can do silly things like that.

4882
04:15:05,990 --> 04:15:06,790
You can...

4883
04:15:06,790 --> 04:15:09,950
There's so many things, ways to connect with your chat and stuff.

4884
04:15:14,110 --> 04:15:15,570
Common YouTube L.

4885
04:15:16,330 --> 04:15:17,330
But don't worry.

4886
04:15:17,610 --> 04:15:19,990
I don't ever have plans on streaming on twitch.

4887
04:15:21,530 --> 04:15:23,270
If you were just like...

4888
04:15:23,270 --> 04:15:25,150
Oh, she's getting more and more convinced.

4889
04:15:25,510 --> 04:15:26,730
First it's marbles.

4890
04:15:26,750 --> 04:15:27,450
Now it's...

4891
04:15:27,450 --> 04:15:28,530
Now it's...

4892
04:15:28,530 --> 04:15:29,510
Crowd control.

4893
04:15:30,010 --> 04:15:30,730
No, no.

4894
04:15:30,770 --> 04:15:31,230
Don't worry.

4895
04:15:31,330 --> 04:15:32,490
I don't want to stream on twitch.

4896
04:15:38,310 --> 04:15:39,570
Thank God for that.

4897
04:15:41,930 --> 04:15:44,610
Minto is no longer a funny and cute ghost from this day on.

4898
04:15:44,730 --> 04:15:46,030
It's been real, y'all.

4899
04:15:47,570 --> 04:15:48,050
No.

4900
04:15:48,730 --> 04:15:49,970
Good stream gave me lots of fun.

4901
04:15:49,970 --> 04:15:50,630
I have lots of ideas for art.

4902
04:15:50,690 --> 04:15:52,470
Especially art involving slime girls and mint.

4903
04:15:53,390 --> 04:15:54,290
Wait, your name.

4904
04:15:56,610 --> 04:15:57,090
I'm...

4905
04:15:57,090 --> 04:15:57,390
I'm...

4906
04:15:58,730 --> 04:16:00,470
Cute Sans Frontiers.

4907
04:16:00,730 --> 04:16:08,490
You can encounter the dead guy early if you're AFK for too long or in an endless hallway.

4908
04:16:08,790 --> 04:16:09,010
Oh.

4909
04:16:09,370 --> 04:16:10,710
Then what do you do with him?

4910
04:16:10,870 --> 04:16:11,850
Oh, does he just kill you?

4911
04:16:12,090 --> 04:16:19,950
From what I understand, this game is about a ghost maid who cleans up her delinquent master's mansion, gets lost in sewers, somehow becomes even stinkier.

4912
04:16:19,950 --> 04:16:21,350
Congrats on the win, Minto.

4913
04:16:22,230 --> 04:16:23,570
I am very curious.

4914
04:16:23,770 --> 04:16:24,110
I know...

4915
04:16:24,110 --> 04:16:24,510
Hold on.

4916
04:16:24,630 --> 04:16:27,110
We'll come back to the nice music in a second.

4917
04:16:28,790 --> 04:16:32,450
Instead of this almost penis music.

4918
04:16:34,890 --> 04:16:35,370
Yeah.

4919
04:16:35,510 --> 04:16:36,890
The Karamari Hospital.

4920
04:16:36,990 --> 04:16:38,790
Unlock the secrets of the Stranger Banner Hospital.

4921
04:16:38,950 --> 04:16:40,070
And then the dollhouse.

4922
04:16:40,510 --> 04:16:41,350
And then you can...

4923
04:16:41,350 --> 04:16:43,630
Eventually, you can build your own mansion.

4924
04:16:43,990 --> 04:16:45,130
That seems so fun.

4925
04:16:45,350 --> 04:16:48,030
This one seems like for an insane person, actually.

4926
04:16:48,330 --> 04:16:49,810
Endless mode seems like...

4927
04:16:49,810 --> 04:16:49,930
I don't know.

4928
04:16:50,950 --> 04:16:53,250
If you actually are insane.

4929
04:17:00,150 --> 04:17:01,290
This is so relaxing.

4930
04:17:01,490 --> 04:17:02,290
Even when you...

4931
04:17:03,050 --> 04:17:05,490
Even when you and Twitch chat, folks don't believe it.

4932
04:17:05,570 --> 04:17:06,510
I know.

4933
04:17:09,290 --> 04:17:10,230
It's so funny.

4934
04:17:11,030 --> 04:17:11,410
Gosh.

4935
04:17:11,470 --> 04:17:12,610
This music is so nice.

4936
04:17:12,850 --> 04:17:14,890
I wish I had this as like a normal BGM.

4937
04:17:19,250 --> 04:17:21,370
I know we're not there yet, but do you have any spooky memories?

4938
04:17:21,390 --> 04:17:21,990
Do you have any plans for October?

4939
04:17:22,190 --> 04:17:22,610
Actually.

4940
04:17:23,310 --> 04:17:23,870
Yes.

4941
04:17:24,170 --> 04:17:26,810
Well, first off, my birthday is in October.

4942
04:17:27,330 --> 04:17:28,790
October 1st, everybody.

4943
04:17:30,630 --> 04:17:31,370
Endless mode.

4944
04:17:31,370 --> 04:17:33,310
Eventually, you get multiple monsters at once.

4945
04:17:33,370 --> 04:17:34,330
It's actually pretty interesting.

4946
04:17:35,210 --> 04:17:38,070
Again, for insane people.

4947
04:17:41,370 --> 04:17:43,390
And then not 31st.

4948
04:17:43,390 --> 04:17:43,870
No, no.

4949
04:17:46,270 --> 04:17:48,430
I died on October 1st.

4950
04:17:48,430 --> 04:17:49,810
Not the 31st.

4951
04:17:49,810 --> 04:17:50,990
I say it's my birthday.

4952
04:17:51,390 --> 04:17:52,030
It's my death day.

4953
04:17:52,450 --> 04:17:53,530
Birth is a ghost.

4954
04:17:55,430 --> 04:17:55,910
So.

4955
04:17:56,670 --> 04:17:58,110
Mine is October 20th.

4956
04:17:59,230 --> 04:18:00,190
October twinsies.

4957
04:18:02,630 --> 04:18:04,110
What do you want for your birthday, Minto?

4958
04:18:04,410 --> 04:18:05,870
Well, we still have plenty of time.

4959
04:18:07,430 --> 04:18:08,730
I know what I want.

4960
04:18:09,650 --> 04:18:11,330
I'm gonna hope for it.

4961
04:18:12,010 --> 04:18:14,490
I'm gonna build my own mansion with slime girls and maids.

4962
04:18:14,730 --> 04:18:15,370
You know what?

4963
04:18:15,390 --> 04:18:16,170
Forget the mansion.

4964
04:18:17,710 --> 04:18:19,290
Wait, you forgot the blackjack.

4965
04:18:19,550 --> 04:18:20,030
Dude, space.

4966
04:18:20,470 --> 04:18:21,370
I'm blackjack.

4967
04:18:21,370 --> 04:18:21,670
Blackjack!

4968
04:18:24,670 --> 04:18:25,190
Blackjack!

4969
04:18:25,190 --> 04:18:25,430
Jack!

4970
04:18:25,430 --> 04:18:25,890
Happy birthday.

4971
04:18:26,030 --> 04:18:26,870
Thanks, Mary Faye!

4972
04:18:27,630 --> 04:18:29,230
So, on my birthday...

4973
04:18:31,670 --> 04:18:33,790
October 1st is my 06th birthday.

4974
04:18:34,470 --> 04:18:36,490
What does that mean?

4975
04:18:37,790 --> 04:18:39,970
When you, when you...

4976
04:18:39,970 --> 04:18:42,770
You were, you...

4977
04:18:43,810 --> 04:18:44,330
Fetus?

4978
04:18:48,110 --> 04:18:49,210
Glad you liked the game.

4979
04:18:49,250 --> 04:18:51,970
The dev has made a lot of other good games like Lost in Viva...

4980
04:18:51,970 --> 04:18:52,050
Oh!

4981
04:18:55,070 --> 04:18:56,890
And Lunacid, if you have an itch for more.

4982
04:18:57,150 --> 04:18:58,890
Wait, I've heard of Lost in Vivo before.

4983
04:19:00,490 --> 04:19:01,190
Wait, hold on.

4984
04:19:01,490 --> 04:19:03,510
Wait, there's locked achievements too.

4985
04:19:03,730 --> 04:19:04,970
Oh, these are like Caramari...

4986
04:19:04,970 --> 04:19:06,290
The Caramari...

4987
04:19:07,070 --> 04:19:08,190
The Calamari Hospital.

4988
04:19:09,530 --> 04:19:11,410
Wait, if I go to their store page...

4989
04:19:11,410 --> 04:19:12,450
Oh, sorry, you can hear it.

4990
04:19:14,030 --> 04:19:15,850
Lost in Vivo...

4991
04:19:18,150 --> 04:19:18,550
Wait.

4992
04:19:19,290 --> 04:19:20,510
Is it not on...

4993
04:19:20,510 --> 04:19:21,790
Is it not on...

4994
04:19:21,970 --> 04:19:22,110
Steam?

4995
04:19:29,790 --> 04:19:30,750
Caramari Hospital.

4996
04:19:31,910 --> 04:19:33,030
Catamari Damacy.

4997
04:19:37,030 --> 04:19:39,270
Lunacid is inspired by proto Dark Souls games.

4998
04:19:42,690 --> 04:19:43,250
Marukami!

4999
04:19:44,210 --> 04:19:45,470
Thanks for the ice cream.

5000
04:19:46,750 --> 04:19:47,750
It's on Steam.

5001
04:19:47,850 --> 04:19:49,810
Wait, Lost in...

5002
04:19:50,630 --> 04:19:51,770
Why wasn't it showing up for me?

5003
04:19:52,190 --> 04:19:53,770
Oh, sorry, you can hear it.

5004
04:19:54,550 --> 04:19:56,570
A horror game about claustrophobia.

5005
04:19:56,750 --> 04:19:57,070
Whoa!

5006
04:19:58,250 --> 04:19:59,130
I feel like...

5007
04:19:59,130 --> 04:20:02,090
I feel like maybe I've seen a Let's Play of this or something.

5008
04:20:03,370 --> 04:20:04,770
Or maybe I'm crazy.

5009
04:20:09,670 --> 04:20:10,270
Eww!

5010
04:20:11,090 --> 04:20:12,070
Looks icky.

5011
04:20:15,750 --> 04:20:18,190
I am very much of the mindset where...

5012
04:20:18,190 --> 04:20:21,630
Like I said earlier, I'm pretty picky about my horror game tastes.

5013
04:20:21,990 --> 04:20:24,110
I typically like more...

5014
04:20:25,470 --> 04:20:26,390
Fatal Frame...

5015
04:20:26,630 --> 04:20:27,330
Style...

5016
04:20:28,130 --> 04:20:30,910
I'm not a huge fan of like...

5017
04:20:31,610 --> 04:20:32,170
Monsters?

5018
04:20:32,230 --> 04:20:33,770
Because they don't really scare me.

5019
04:20:34,210 --> 04:20:35,210
Typically, you know?

5020
04:20:35,990 --> 04:20:36,550
Well...

5021
04:20:37,270 --> 04:20:38,410
What's not...

5022
04:20:39,250 --> 04:20:40,630
What's not a spam, please?

5023
04:20:42,830 --> 04:20:43,870
But uh...

5024
04:20:43,870 --> 04:20:45,050
You like ghosts.

5025
04:20:45,110 --> 04:20:46,530
I love ghosts!

5026
04:20:47,950 --> 04:20:49,750
You like when you can't fight back?

5027
04:20:49,950 --> 04:20:50,830
I guess so, maybe.

5028
04:20:52,510 --> 04:20:53,070
Hmm...

5029
04:20:53,070 --> 04:20:55,070
I don't think it's that it's fighting back.

5030
04:20:55,290 --> 04:20:56,070
I just like...

5031
04:20:56,070 --> 04:20:57,590
I just think it scares me more.

5032
04:21:00,130 --> 04:21:00,610
And...

5033
04:21:00,610 --> 04:21:02,790
I like things that scare me.

5034
04:21:04,070 --> 04:21:05,730
Even though they scare me.

5035
04:21:06,110 --> 04:21:07,990
Oh, I've played a little bit of Siren before.

5036
04:21:09,410 --> 04:21:10,250
Oh, Kuon!

5037
04:21:10,490 --> 04:21:11,110
I've never played...

5038
04:21:11,110 --> 04:21:12,110
I haven't played that one actually.

5039
04:21:12,990 --> 04:21:13,790
Or wait...

5040
04:21:14,470 --> 04:21:14,950
Kuon...

5041
04:21:15,590 --> 04:21:16,070
Jewel?

5042
04:21:18,510 --> 04:21:19,970
Kuon is a game though, isn't it?

5043
04:21:23,630 --> 04:21:24,430
Kuon is a game though, isn't it?

5044
04:21:25,570 --> 04:21:26,050
Kuon is a game though, isn't it?

5045
04:21:26,070 --> 04:21:28,230
What about Ghostbusters?

5046
04:21:28,310 --> 04:21:29,350
Keck W.

5047
04:21:29,590 --> 04:21:30,230
Hahaha!

5048
04:21:30,930 --> 04:21:31,570
Hahaha!

5049
04:21:31,570 --> 04:21:32,210
Hahaha!

5050
04:21:32,790 --> 04:21:34,150
Those guys are...

5051
04:21:34,150 --> 04:21:35,430
Those guys are phonies.

5052
04:21:39,610 --> 04:21:40,730
Yeah, Kuon...

5053
04:21:40,730 --> 04:21:41,890
I don't think I ever had it.

5054
04:21:42,110 --> 04:21:42,750
Calling!

5055
04:21:42,890 --> 04:21:44,250
Yes, I loved calling!

5056
04:21:45,370 --> 04:21:46,290
I loved calling.

5057
04:21:46,570 --> 04:21:48,430
System Shock 2 has ghosts in it.

5058
04:21:49,770 --> 04:21:51,090
What about System Shock 1?

5059
04:21:51,090 --> 04:21:51,230
What?

5060
04:21:53,330 --> 04:21:54,310
A cheat horror too?

5061
04:21:54,450 --> 04:21:55,410
Like live stream?

5062
04:21:55,630 --> 04:21:55,990
Yes!

5063
04:21:59,750 --> 04:22:00,310
Yeah...

5064
04:22:00,310 --> 04:22:01,510
I just...

5065
04:22:02,330 --> 04:22:03,110
I love...

5066
04:22:03,110 --> 04:22:05,650
I like horror more like that.

5067
04:22:06,450 --> 04:22:10,310
But it's also not the popular kind of horror, I think.

5068
04:22:11,350 --> 04:22:12,970
I think horror like...

5069
04:22:12,970 --> 04:22:16,990
Monster horror, Resident Evil type horror and stuff is more popular.

5070
04:22:17,490 --> 04:22:18,710
So, unfortunately...

5071
04:22:18,710 --> 04:22:20,350
Because more people are just like...

5072
04:22:20,350 --> 04:22:21,230
Or like, you know...

5073
04:22:24,710 --> 04:22:25,190
Like...

5074
04:22:25,190 --> 04:22:27,550
Oh, there's a serial killer stalking ya.

5075
04:22:27,670 --> 04:22:29,290
Stuff like that is more popular.

5076
04:22:32,810 --> 04:22:35,190
This game's DLC would be fun for Halloween lead up.

5077
04:22:35,410 --> 04:22:35,970
You know what?

5078
04:22:35,970 --> 04:22:36,710
That's a great idea.

5079
04:22:36,890 --> 04:22:39,310
It's kind of far from me playing it.

5080
04:22:39,770 --> 04:22:40,450
Like, you know...

5081
04:22:40,450 --> 04:22:41,190
I'm finishing it...

5082
04:22:41,190 --> 04:22:42,910
The game in July.

5083
04:22:43,390 --> 04:22:43,870
But...

5084
04:22:44,710 --> 04:22:46,270
It would be fun to...

5085
04:22:47,030 --> 04:22:47,510
To...

5086
04:22:48,230 --> 04:22:49,870
Play the DLC and stuff.

5087
04:22:49,870 --> 04:22:50,810
Maybe in...

5088
04:22:53,450 --> 04:22:54,610
In Halloween.

5089
04:22:54,870 --> 04:22:56,210
I'll add it to my calendar.

5090
04:22:56,350 --> 04:22:57,190
So I don't forget.

5091
04:22:59,870 --> 04:23:00,450
Calendar...

5092
04:23:01,070 --> 04:23:01,650
Calendar...

5093
04:23:02,390 --> 04:23:02,970
Calendar...

5094
04:23:02,970 --> 04:23:03,510
Calendar...

5095
04:23:03,510 --> 04:23:04,370
Calendar...

5096
04:23:04,370 --> 04:23:05,610
We'll do it...

5097
04:23:05,610 --> 04:23:06,230
There.

5098
04:23:09,170 --> 04:23:09,750
Spooky...

5099
04:23:09,750 --> 04:23:12,330
Spooky's Mansion DLC.

5100
04:23:14,530 --> 04:23:15,110
Calamari...

5101
04:23:16,530 --> 04:23:17,110
How...

5102
04:23:17,110 --> 04:23:17,830
Can I do both?

5103
04:23:18,010 --> 04:23:19,850
Do you think I can do both DLCs in one stream?

5104
04:23:20,610 --> 04:23:21,130
Calamari...

5105
04:23:21,130 --> 04:23:22,070
Hospital...

5106
04:23:26,030 --> 04:23:26,550
And...

5107
04:23:28,550 --> 04:23:29,070
Dollhouse.

5108
04:23:33,450 --> 04:23:34,230
Or are they...

5109
04:23:34,230 --> 04:23:35,070
Are they pretty long?

5110
04:23:35,130 --> 04:23:35,410
I think.

5111
04:23:37,070 --> 04:23:37,850
It's possible.

5112
04:23:39,190 --> 04:23:41,710
Are you going to play the Silent Hill 2 remake on stream?

5113
04:23:42,250 --> 04:23:43,430
I think I will.

5114
04:23:44,470 --> 04:23:45,870
Even though I'm very...

5115
04:23:47,570 --> 04:23:48,390
I'm hesitant.

5116
04:23:49,090 --> 04:23:50,230
It's Bloober Team.

5117
04:23:50,750 --> 04:23:51,710
So I'm hesitant.

5118
04:23:53,690 --> 04:23:54,230
And...

5119
04:23:54,230 --> 04:23:57,570
Apparently the new Nintendo game is also Bloober Team.

5120
04:23:57,950 --> 04:23:59,110
The M.E.O.

5121
04:23:59,470 --> 04:24:00,350
I'm nervous.

5122
04:24:00,870 --> 04:24:02,650
I'm not a big fan of Bloober Team.

5123
04:24:04,610 --> 04:24:05,870
Have you played Signalist?

5124
04:24:05,930 --> 04:24:06,390
I have!

5125
04:24:07,190 --> 04:24:08,630
I really like Signalist.

5126
04:24:08,650 --> 04:24:09,530
It was pretty spooky too.

5127
04:24:11,730 --> 04:24:12,270
Corral!

5128
04:24:12,450 --> 04:24:13,370
Welcome to membership.

5129
04:24:13,490 --> 04:24:13,850
Thank you!

5130
04:24:14,750 --> 04:24:15,510
M.E.O.

5131
04:24:15,510 --> 04:24:16,090
Isn't Bloober?

5132
04:24:16,470 --> 04:24:17,550
I thought...

5133
04:24:17,550 --> 04:24:18,370
I thought...

5134
04:24:18,370 --> 04:24:20,270
I thought people figured out it was.

5135
04:24:25,370 --> 04:24:28,090
I saw a source say it could not be Bloober.

5136
04:24:32,110 --> 04:24:33,830
Have you played Yomawari?

5137
04:24:37,350 --> 04:24:37,830
Yes.

5138
04:24:38,850 --> 04:24:41,450
Before I went to heaven, actually, I played Yomawari.

5139
04:24:41,510 --> 04:24:41,910
But...

5140
04:24:41,910 --> 04:24:43,530
I haven't played Yomawari 2.

5141
04:24:43,850 --> 04:24:47,150
But I have a little bit of trauma from Yomawari.

5142
04:24:50,430 --> 04:24:51,110
Trauma.

5143
04:24:51,110 --> 04:24:52,210
Karateka, you remember.

5144
04:24:55,370 --> 04:24:59,830
I have a little bit of trauma from the final boss of Yomawari.

5145
04:25:01,050 --> 04:25:02,270
You couldn't beat it?

5146
04:25:02,310 --> 04:25:02,750
No, I did.

5147
04:25:03,270 --> 04:25:04,390
Just with...

5148
04:25:05,630 --> 04:25:06,970
A lot...

5149
04:25:06,970 --> 04:25:08,490
Of swearing.

5150
04:25:10,870 --> 04:25:11,970
Lorekeeper, welcome!

5151
04:25:13,310 --> 04:25:15,190
Look up old game cosmo...

5152
04:25:15,190 --> 04:25:16,110
Cosmo...

5153
04:25:16,110 --> 04:25:17,130
Cosmetic...

5154
04:25:17,150 --> 04:25:17,850
Cosmetology...

5155
04:25:18,810 --> 04:25:20,510
Cosmology of Kyoto.

5156
04:25:20,970 --> 04:25:21,530
From...

5157
04:25:22,770 --> 04:25:24,770
From Soft's old game, Kuon.

5158
04:25:26,710 --> 04:25:28,910
Like I said, I am familiar with Kuon.

5159
04:25:28,990 --> 04:25:29,590
Just a little bit.

5160
04:25:30,970 --> 04:25:35,170
But Cosmology of Kyoto...

5161
04:25:35,970 --> 04:25:38,390
This one I've never heard of before.

5162
04:25:41,270 --> 04:25:41,910
1993.

5163
04:25:43,990 --> 04:25:45,930
Never heard this one before.

5164
04:25:47,150 --> 04:25:47,750
Is it a... woah!

5165
04:25:48,270 --> 04:25:48,690
Woah!

5166
04:25:49,590 --> 04:25:50,230
Interesting.

5167
04:25:52,930 --> 04:25:53,790
Is it... what?

5168
04:25:57,850 --> 04:25:59,490
Is it like a visual novel?

5169
04:25:59,730 --> 04:26:00,290
What is this?

5170
04:26:00,470 --> 04:26:02,230
A visual mindscape of old Japan.

5171
04:26:02,910 --> 04:26:05,470
This looks really interesting.

5172
04:26:08,010 --> 04:26:09,850
I have no idea...

5173
04:26:12,210 --> 04:26:14,150
what the gameplay... oh my gosh!

5174
04:26:14,150 --> 04:26:14,590
Woah!

5175
04:26:15,930 --> 04:26:18,110
Sorry, I'm looking at google image googles.

5176
04:26:18,710 --> 04:26:19,210
Images...

5177
04:26:22,130 --> 04:26:25,010
Have you played the Watson Scott test?

5178
04:26:25,410 --> 04:26:26,710
It's a personality test game.

5179
04:26:27,130 --> 04:26:28,470
It could show your IP address.

5180
04:26:28,650 --> 04:26:29,950
Oh, I don't want that to happen.

5181
04:26:31,210 --> 04:26:32,530
But I haven't played it.

5182
04:26:33,350 --> 04:26:34,910
You know, Alan Wake is pretty spooky.

5183
04:26:35,050 --> 04:26:36,370
I have Alan Wake!

5184
04:26:38,130 --> 04:26:39,370
I did buy it.

5185
04:26:39,970 --> 04:26:42,250
And I got my Epic Games account back.

5186
04:26:42,490 --> 04:26:42,990
So...

5187
04:26:44,150 --> 04:26:45,450
I could play it.

5188
04:26:46,810 --> 04:26:47,290
Soma...

5189
04:26:47,290 --> 04:26:48,790
Oh, a lot of people have been...

5190
04:26:48,790 --> 04:26:49,350
Or rather...

5191
04:26:49,350 --> 04:26:51,370
I always see Soma recommended.

5192
04:26:52,850 --> 04:26:54,770
Glad to be here with me for a month.

5193
04:26:55,030 --> 04:26:55,350
Ah!

5194
04:26:55,790 --> 04:26:57,010
Erin, thank you!

5195
04:26:57,330 --> 04:26:58,270
Thanks for a month!

5196
04:26:59,130 --> 04:27:00,570
Ju-on the grudge on the Wii U.

5197
04:27:00,750 --> 04:27:01,230
I...

5198
04:27:01,230 --> 04:27:01,930
Yes.

5199
04:27:02,450 --> 04:27:02,930
I...

5200
04:27:03,590 --> 04:27:05,710
When someone said Kuon earlier, I was just like...

5201
04:27:05,710 --> 04:27:07,830
Wait, the Ju-on grudge game for the Wii.

5202
04:27:11,010 --> 04:27:11,810
FMV games.

5203
04:27:12,130 --> 04:27:13,110
Like Seventh Guester.

5204
04:27:13,110 --> 04:27:14,230
Oh, I know...

5205
04:27:14,230 --> 04:27:15,390
I don't know Seventh Guest.

5206
04:27:15,670 --> 04:27:17,190
The Seventh Guest.

5207
04:27:17,210 --> 04:27:19,310
But I do know Phantasmagoria.

5208
04:27:21,270 --> 04:27:22,590
The Seventh Guest.

5209
04:27:22,790 --> 04:27:25,950
You guys are always giving such interesting...

5210
04:27:31,070 --> 04:27:31,550
Recommendations.

5211
04:27:33,930 --> 04:27:34,810
Deadly Premonition.

5212
04:27:34,870 --> 04:27:36,510
I have that also on my list.

5213
04:27:37,010 --> 04:27:38,250
Probably will do it...

5214
04:27:39,850 --> 04:27:41,170
Probably sometime in August.

5215
04:27:41,210 --> 04:27:41,950
I want to play it.

5216
04:27:43,790 --> 04:27:45,230
Just nine more months.

5217
04:27:45,770 --> 04:27:46,530
Until what?

5218
04:27:47,370 --> 04:27:48,550
Until what, Haru?

5219
04:27:51,630 --> 04:27:52,430
Scarlet Hollow.

5220
04:27:52,730 --> 04:27:53,950
It's a spooky visual novel.

5221
04:27:54,270 --> 04:27:56,030
Same team that made Slay the Princess.

5222
04:27:56,110 --> 04:27:56,750
No way, really!

5223
04:27:56,970 --> 04:27:57,990
I love Slay the Princess.

5224
04:27:58,790 --> 04:27:59,310
Scarlet...

5225
04:28:01,850 --> 04:28:02,370
Hollow.

5226
04:28:04,470 --> 04:28:08,890
I love how this has suddenly turned into like a... game recommendation corner.

5227
04:28:10,510 --> 04:28:11,650
Ooh, it's kinda creepy.

5228
04:28:12,310 --> 04:28:13,090
I'll let you know.

5229
04:28:23,730 --> 04:28:29,650
I think I'll play Faith during October as well.

5230
04:28:30,550 --> 04:28:32,530
Though I've played them before, is that okay?

5231
04:28:33,250 --> 04:28:35,230
Lost in Vivo... Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

5232
04:28:36,370 --> 04:28:38,310
We were just talking about that, random.

5233
04:28:43,090 --> 04:28:43,870
Faith is great!

5234
04:28:45,430 --> 04:28:46,050
It's okay?

5235
04:28:46,350 --> 04:28:48,150
If I play it again?

5236
04:28:49,610 --> 04:28:50,790
I thought you said fate.

5237
04:28:50,950 --> 04:28:51,790
No, Faith!

5238
04:28:53,990 --> 04:28:55,690
Minto, you already went through the entire game?

5239
04:28:55,790 --> 04:28:56,190
I have!

5240
04:28:56,470 --> 04:28:57,490
I'm a gamer.

5241
04:28:57,770 --> 04:28:59,090
I went through it, baby.

5242
04:29:01,110 --> 04:29:01,550
Mortis.

5243
04:29:02,190 --> 04:29:04,930
I'll add that to October.

5244
04:29:07,730 --> 04:29:08,610
Faith Trilogy.

5245
04:29:09,970 --> 04:29:12,690
I don't think I'll be able to do all of three.

5246
04:29:13,090 --> 04:29:14,350
Maybe the same day, but...

5247
04:29:18,350 --> 04:29:20,370
Great collab game.

5248
04:29:20,610 --> 04:29:21,590
Oh, yes!

5249
04:29:21,990 --> 04:29:25,670
Actually, Matara and I keep trying to do a Deep Rock Galactic collab.

5250
04:29:26,170 --> 04:29:28,570
Maybe with Henya or something.

5251
04:29:42,600 --> 04:29:43,440
Corpse Party.

5252
04:29:44,320 --> 04:29:45,580
I love Corpse Party.

5253
04:29:48,760 --> 04:29:49,780
Rock and Stone.

5254
04:29:50,440 --> 04:29:52,260
They're making a new chapter for Faith?

5255
04:29:52,360 --> 04:29:53,120
No way, really?

5256
04:29:54,360 --> 04:29:54,880
Erdorf?

5257
04:29:55,660 --> 04:29:57,180
I want to work with that guy.

5258
04:29:59,260 --> 04:30:00,040
Minto game.

5259
04:30:03,820 --> 04:30:04,940
Be kind of crazy.

5260
04:30:06,600 --> 04:30:08,320
Did someone say Rock and Stone?

5261
04:30:08,800 --> 04:30:09,720
Rock and Stone!

5262
04:30:12,280 --> 04:30:13,320
I haven't played...

5263
04:30:13,320 --> 04:30:17,400
I saw actually at AX, they had several areas where you could play...

5264
04:30:17,400 --> 04:30:18,660
Corpse Party 2.

5265
04:30:19,480 --> 04:30:20,360
But like...

5266
04:30:20,360 --> 04:30:21,860
It's in 3D.

5267
04:30:21,980 --> 04:30:23,520
I don't know how to feel about it.

5268
04:30:23,600 --> 04:30:25,560
But also, there was a Corpse Party 2 already.

5269
04:30:26,100 --> 04:30:27,580
It was like set in a hospital.

5270
04:30:27,660 --> 04:30:28,560
I never played it.

5271
04:30:28,620 --> 04:30:29,560
I only played...

5272
04:30:31,240 --> 04:30:32,220
I used to...

5273
04:30:32,220 --> 04:30:32,740
I loved...

5274
04:30:32,740 --> 04:30:34,780
I think her name was Naho from Corpse Party.

5275
04:30:36,560 --> 04:30:37,800
There's one line though.

5276
04:30:37,900 --> 04:30:38,600
Yeah, Naho.

5277
04:30:38,640 --> 04:30:39,520
I really loved her.

5278
04:30:39,780 --> 04:30:41,760
I even cosplayed her at one point.

5279
04:30:43,300 --> 04:30:43,740
But...

5280
04:30:43,740 --> 04:30:43,940
Um...

5281
04:30:46,340 --> 04:30:47,600
There's one line.

5282
04:30:47,820 --> 04:30:51,620
If you know Corpse Party, you know the famous...

5283
04:30:51,620 --> 04:30:52,560
The infamous line.

5284
04:30:53,680 --> 04:30:54,780
But I played...

5285
04:30:54,780 --> 04:30:57,080
Regular Corpse Party and then I played...

5286
04:30:57,080 --> 04:30:57,380
What?

5287
04:30:57,400 --> 04:30:57,900
Book of Shadows?

5288
04:30:57,980 --> 04:30:58,800
I didn't play...

5289
04:30:58,800 --> 04:31:00,960
The Sachiko's birthday one.

5290
04:31:01,600 --> 04:31:02,420
The butter!

5291
04:31:04,360 --> 04:31:05,280
Rochebug knows.

5292
04:31:06,520 --> 04:31:06,960
Rowlet knows.

5293
04:31:08,560 --> 04:31:09,160
Butter.

5294
04:31:09,900 --> 04:31:11,040
The pooper.

5295
04:31:17,720 --> 04:31:19,780
Doki talked a lot about Corpse Party on stream before.

5296
04:31:19,860 --> 04:31:20,780
Wait, has she played it?

5297
04:31:21,320 --> 04:31:22,360
I'll have to ask her.

5298
04:31:22,960 --> 04:31:24,300
I didn't think she liked horror.

5299
04:31:24,700 --> 04:31:25,620
But I guess it's...

5300
04:31:25,620 --> 04:31:26,140
I don't know.

5301
04:31:26,220 --> 04:31:29,560
It's not scary but the atmosphere is very, very creepy.

5302
04:31:29,920 --> 04:31:32,720
The sound design in the game is very, very good I think.

5303
04:31:34,660 --> 04:31:36,800
There's one ending that you can get.

5304
04:31:37,200 --> 04:31:39,380
Like one death ending where...

5305
04:31:40,960 --> 04:31:41,400
Where...

5306
04:31:42,080 --> 04:31:42,520
You...

5307
04:31:42,520 --> 04:31:43,160
Uh...

5308
04:31:43,160 --> 04:31:43,720
You die.

5309
04:31:43,720 --> 04:31:44,560
You get buried alive.

5310
04:31:45,080 --> 04:31:47,240
And like it just actually makes me choke.

5311
04:31:47,440 --> 04:31:48,420
Because it's so...

5312
04:31:49,540 --> 04:31:50,620
It's so...

5313
04:31:52,260 --> 04:31:54,480
The sound design is so good.

5314
04:31:54,560 --> 04:31:55,920
The voice actors are so good.

5315
04:32:00,140 --> 04:32:02,080
Hungry ghosts for the PS2 could be interesting.

5316
04:32:02,240 --> 04:32:03,020
Hungry ghosts.

5317
04:32:11,080 --> 04:32:13,800
Why does this look older than a PS2 game?

5318
04:32:16,680 --> 04:32:17,880
It's only in Japanese.

5319
04:32:18,940 --> 04:32:20,040
Nihongo only.

5320
04:32:21,640 --> 04:32:23,520
Looks maybe to be the case.

5321
04:32:24,540 --> 04:32:26,340
I think I have...

5322
04:32:26,340 --> 04:32:28,960
I have so many games though.

5323
04:32:29,420 --> 04:32:30,660
I'll ask for recommendation.

5324
04:32:30,680 --> 04:32:33,220
If you want to leave a recommendation in the comments or something.

5325
04:32:34,240 --> 04:32:35,640
For me to...

5326
04:32:36,720 --> 04:32:38,260
For me to...

5327
04:32:40,360 --> 04:32:41,160
What's the word?

5328
04:32:41,300 --> 04:32:43,100
Go over in the future.

5329
04:32:43,360 --> 04:32:44,500
Then, you know...

5330
04:32:45,620 --> 04:32:47,200
That would be the best.

5331
04:32:47,280 --> 04:32:48,400
Because otherwise I'll forget.

5332
04:32:50,180 --> 04:32:51,100
Yume Nikki.

5333
04:32:51,480 --> 04:32:54,100
I love Yume Nikki though.

5334
04:33:04,980 --> 04:33:05,920
Yeah, maybe.

5335
04:33:06,780 --> 04:33:09,800
There's like the 3D Yume Nikki but it's not the same, right?

5336
04:33:11,600 --> 04:33:12,500
Night Trap.

5337
04:33:12,940 --> 04:33:14,620
Very infamous FMV.

5338
04:33:15,960 --> 04:33:17,980
That more or less led to the...

5339
04:33:17,980 --> 04:33:19,180
ESRB is creation?

5340
04:33:19,500 --> 04:33:19,800
Really?

5341
04:33:20,020 --> 04:33:21,980
Wait, I have heard of Night Trap though.

5342
04:33:22,080 --> 04:33:22,660
Never mind, just kidding.

5343
04:33:22,900 --> 04:33:24,240
Thank you for defending Patamon.

5344
04:33:27,560 --> 04:33:31,680
I have heard of Night Trap, but I've not played Night Trap.

5345
04:33:32,320 --> 04:33:36,220
There was that one game that came out just a couple years ago.

5346
04:33:37,120 --> 04:33:38,920
At Dead of Night, I think it was called.

5347
04:33:39,220 --> 04:33:41,000
It's not exactly FMV.

5348
04:33:41,140 --> 04:33:42,480
Or maybe... does it count?

5349
04:33:42,620 --> 04:33:43,440
Actually, I don't know.

5350
04:33:46,520 --> 04:33:49,060
But I... I've always...

5351
04:33:50,160 --> 04:33:53,100
It's... It's... It's...

5352
04:33:53,540 --> 04:33:58,580
Like, I want to play it, but I think I would actually be too stressed for it.

5353
04:34:01,120 --> 04:34:03,540
Oh, Dot Flo... Oh my god, Dot Flo.

5354
04:34:06,640 --> 04:34:13,060
I have... I have not heard of that game.

5355
04:34:13,440 --> 04:34:15,640
In so long.

5356
04:34:16,840 --> 04:34:18,400
Oh my god.

5357
04:34:19,380 --> 04:34:20,900
Oh my god, Dot Flo.

5358
04:34:20,920 --> 04:34:23,560
I completely forgot about Dot Flo until just now.

5359
04:34:24,340 --> 04:34:24,940
Wow.

5360
04:34:31,160 --> 04:34:33,700
Night Trap requires... requires a guide.

5361
04:34:37,220 --> 04:34:38,960
Night Trap is so cheesy.

5362
04:34:39,080 --> 04:34:40,040
It looks like...

5363
04:34:40,640 --> 04:34:41,720
It looks like a...

5364
04:34:42,680 --> 04:34:45,240
80s, you know, like... what's the word?

5365
04:34:46,220 --> 04:34:47,780
Like an 80s slasher.

5366
04:34:52,450 --> 04:34:53,250
Campy horror.

5367
04:34:53,710 --> 04:34:55,030
I love that though.

5368
04:34:55,610 --> 04:34:57,150
What was it released on?

5369
04:34:59,310 --> 04:35:00,890
Is it Mega... Mega CD?

5370
04:35:03,070 --> 04:35:04,770
Sega CD, wow.

5371
04:35:08,770 --> 04:35:10,210
There is no gore though.

5372
04:35:10,390 --> 04:35:10,730
Oh.

5373
04:35:14,930 --> 04:35:16,130
Little goody-two-shoes.

5374
04:35:16,170 --> 04:35:18,890
Oh yes, I've seen... I've heard a lot of really good things about that.

5375
04:35:20,750 --> 04:35:21,710
Or rather...

5376
04:35:24,090 --> 04:35:25,670
The animation and everything.

5377
04:35:26,070 --> 04:35:27,090
Looks so awesome.

5378
04:35:27,690 --> 04:35:29,690
I remember a while back you were talking about maybe...

5379
04:35:29,690 --> 04:35:32,010
only being around till the end of the summer.

5380
04:35:32,090 --> 04:35:33,630
Now we're here discussing October plans.

5381
04:35:33,810 --> 04:35:34,250
Feels nice.

5382
04:35:34,570 --> 04:35:35,570
It's good to have you around.

5383
04:35:37,250 --> 04:35:38,590
Thank you, SilverAid.

5384
04:35:38,650 --> 04:35:39,290
Thank you!

5385
04:35:40,070 --> 04:35:40,550
Yeah.

5386
04:35:42,690 --> 04:35:43,610
I think...

5387
04:35:44,970 --> 04:35:45,670
Hmm...

5388
04:35:51,050 --> 04:35:51,750
Hmm...

5389
04:35:51,750 --> 04:35:53,490
I don't know what to... how to...

5390
04:35:53,490 --> 04:35:56,270
I think like...

5391
04:35:57,850 --> 04:35:58,550
I...

5392
04:36:01,110 --> 04:36:01,810
Had...

5393
04:36:01,810 --> 04:36:03,090
Well...

5394
04:36:03,090 --> 04:36:05,790
I... initially was just like...

5395
04:36:08,050 --> 04:36:09,550
Coming back...

5396
04:36:09,550 --> 04:36:13,410
I wasn't sure... you know...

5397
04:36:16,110 --> 04:36:16,870
Uh...

5398
04:36:19,330 --> 04:36:19,930
But...

5399
04:36:19,930 --> 04:36:20,590
Um...

5400
04:36:22,250 --> 04:36:24,130
I've talked with a lot of people.

5401
04:36:24,850 --> 04:36:27,210
Like a lot, a lot, a lot of people.

5402
04:36:28,870 --> 04:36:29,870
And it's kind of...

5403
04:36:29,870 --> 04:36:31,950
You know, at first I was like...

5404
04:36:33,510 --> 04:36:34,110
Unsure...

5405
04:36:34,110 --> 04:36:37,270
Of what direction to go and... and stuff.

5406
04:36:38,910 --> 04:36:39,510
But...

5407
04:36:39,910 --> 04:36:40,590
You know...

5408
04:36:40,890 --> 04:36:43,110
Through a bunch of people's advice and...

5409
04:36:45,330 --> 04:36:45,930
Um...

5410
04:36:45,930 --> 04:36:46,710
I've...

5411
04:36:46,710 --> 04:36:47,610
My...

5412
04:36:47,610 --> 04:36:49,070
Uh...

5413
04:36:50,170 --> 04:36:50,970
Experiences?

5414
04:36:52,890 --> 04:36:53,690
I...

5415
04:36:53,690 --> 04:36:54,090
...

5416
04:36:55,070 --> 04:36:57,170
I felt like maybe I should...

5417
04:36:57,170 --> 04:36:58,150
Hmm....

5418
04:36:59,050 --> 04:37:02,590
Go differently from my original plan...

5419
04:37:02,590 --> 04:37:03,330
That I was thinking.

5420
04:37:05,650 --> 04:37:06,450
Um...

5421
04:37:06,450 --> 04:37:07,910
So I'm still...

5422
04:37:07,910 --> 04:37:08,530
Even now...

5423
04:37:08,530 --> 04:37:08,930
Like...

5424
04:37:08,930 --> 04:37:11,190
Unsure if I'm even...

5425
04:37:12,330 --> 04:37:13,870
Doing the right thing...

5426
04:37:13,870 --> 04:37:14,390
I guess...

5427
04:37:14,390 --> 04:37:14,930
Hahaha...

5428
04:37:14,930 --> 04:37:15,910
Um...

5429
04:37:19,230 --> 04:37:20,690
Everything is so confusing.

5430
04:37:22,170 --> 04:37:24,330
I'm always just like, why can't things be normal?

5431
04:37:27,810 --> 04:37:31,350
But I do really love streaming.

5432
04:37:32,970 --> 04:37:35,330
And if you guys will still have me...

5433
04:37:36,350 --> 04:37:38,470
Then you know, I can be around.

5434
04:37:40,270 --> 04:37:42,690
I don't know for how much longer, but...

5435
04:37:44,970 --> 04:37:46,230
For the...

5436
04:37:46,230 --> 04:37:50,430
For the future...

5437
04:37:50,430 --> 04:37:53,010
I don't even know how to say it.

5438
04:37:54,490 --> 04:37:57,150
What is considered long-term anyway?

5439
04:38:02,560 --> 04:38:03,620
Foreseeable future?

5440
04:38:04,020 --> 04:38:04,240
Yeah!

5441
04:38:04,940 --> 04:38:05,780
Yeah!

5442
04:38:07,600 --> 04:38:08,960
50 years.

5443
04:38:09,800 --> 04:38:10,640
Okay.

5444
04:38:18,500 --> 04:38:19,580
It's just all still...

5445
04:38:20,780 --> 04:38:21,840
Confusing to me.

5446
04:38:22,280 --> 04:38:22,980
Everything.

5447
04:38:24,620 --> 04:38:25,320
But...

5448
04:38:27,140 --> 04:38:29,920
Yeah, I'm always thinking about it like every day.

5449
04:38:30,260 --> 04:38:31,260
I'm like...

5450
04:38:31,260 --> 04:38:33,900
Minto's brain goes...

5451
04:38:40,320 --> 04:38:42,240
But I'm doing my best.

5452
04:38:43,140 --> 04:38:43,840
So...

5453
04:38:45,400 --> 04:38:47,560
Thanks for supporting me!

5454
04:38:48,500 --> 04:38:49,180
Thanks for hanging out with me tonight.

5455
04:38:49,380 --> 04:38:54,860
Thanks for watching me go through 1,000 rooms of craziness.

5456
04:38:58,060 --> 04:39:00,220
Actual 1,000 rooms of craziness.

5457
04:39:02,340 --> 04:39:04,620
Stream from the nursing home if you have to.

5458
04:39:05,480 --> 04:39:06,980
Six seasons and a movie!

5459
04:39:07,620 --> 04:39:09,280
Community never came back!

5460
04:39:11,620 --> 04:39:13,520
Thank you for being here to entertain us.

5461
04:39:13,700 --> 04:39:15,020
We're lucky to have you here.

5462
04:39:15,420 --> 04:39:16,220
Thanks, Sean.

5463
04:39:18,240 --> 04:39:19,260
Welcome to membership!

5464
04:39:20,660 --> 04:39:22,380
Never brought up, but I want a second Soma.

5465
04:39:22,520 --> 04:39:26,560
The story has stuck to me more than almost any other game I've ever played.

5466
04:39:26,820 --> 04:39:27,720
It's not just scary.

5467
04:39:27,740 --> 04:39:28,260
It's haunting.

5468
04:39:28,300 --> 04:39:29,540
It keeps haunting you after you finish.

5469
04:39:30,460 --> 04:39:32,260
Okay, I'll add it to our October.

5470
04:39:32,620 --> 04:39:33,160
I don't want to...

5471
04:39:33,160 --> 04:39:33,680
I'm like...

5472
04:39:34,080 --> 04:39:35,920
I'm always in the mood to play spooky horror.

5473
04:39:37,840 --> 04:39:39,020
Try Princess, thank you!

5474
04:39:40,500 --> 04:39:42,620
You're always in the mood to play more horror, but I'm like...

5475
04:39:42,620 --> 04:39:44,580
Maybe I should start gathering stuff for October.

5476
04:39:45,380 --> 04:39:46,560
Spooky, spooky month.

5477
04:39:49,460 --> 04:39:49,980
Soma.

5478
04:39:51,440 --> 04:39:52,760
Is that a game I can...

5479
04:39:52,760 --> 04:39:53,940
Let's see, how long to be...

5480
04:39:55,940 --> 04:39:56,460
Soma.

5481
04:39:57,820 --> 04:39:59,660
As long as you're happy, we'll be happy.

5482
04:40:00,020 --> 04:40:02,640
We'll be especially happy for however long you keep streaming.

5483
04:40:03,100 --> 04:40:03,620
We'll be especially happy for however long you keep streaming.

5484
04:40:03,620 --> 04:40:03,980
Thank you.

5485
04:40:04,100 --> 04:40:05,220
A third Soma.

5486
04:40:06,560 --> 04:40:07,680
Oh, nine hours?

5487
04:40:08,120 --> 04:40:09,280
It's probably like what...

5488
04:40:09,280 --> 04:40:11,020
Oh wait, it took me about six...

5489
04:40:11,020 --> 04:40:12,880
No, probably like two to three streams.

5490
04:40:14,580 --> 04:40:15,780
I'm not gonna say your name.

5491
04:40:18,260 --> 04:40:19,720
Your name is Please!

5492
04:40:20,360 --> 04:40:22,000
Oh, you have such nice manners!

5493
04:40:24,480 --> 04:40:26,580
You have such nice manners.

5494
04:40:32,890 --> 04:40:38,050
What's most difficult for me right now is there's so many games that I want to play that are kind of...

5495
04:40:39,270 --> 04:40:40,350
Kind of...

5496
04:40:42,070 --> 04:40:42,610
Long?

5497
04:40:43,310 --> 04:40:45,090
I'm trying not to be like...

5498
04:40:45,090 --> 04:40:47,670
Okay, let's play every long game at once!

5499
04:40:48,190 --> 04:40:49,190
Okay, let's play every long game at once!

5500
04:40:49,190 --> 04:40:52,190
So it's nice to get some games in like this kind of that I can do in one stream.

5501
04:40:52,250 --> 04:40:53,210
I try to balance it.

5502
04:40:53,990 --> 04:40:56,470
Like having, you know, obviously I'm doing Metal Gear.

5503
04:40:56,670 --> 04:40:58,410
But then I have like also Eternal Darkness.

5504
04:40:58,790 --> 04:41:02,290
And then I do some other in-between stuff as well.

5505
04:41:03,330 --> 04:41:04,630
It's like what Gray Fox says.

5506
04:41:04,730 --> 04:41:08,010
Just keep fighting for what you believe in and we'll be there to support and laugh with you.

5507
04:41:08,850 --> 04:41:10,310
Thanks so much for caring.

5508
04:41:10,310 --> 04:41:14,310
I was a hardcore Lurker Vaude Watcher, so I'm glad you're back, Minto.

5509
04:41:14,470 --> 04:41:16,170
I decided I didn't want to miss out this time.

5510
04:41:16,270 --> 04:41:17,970
And your streams are the most fun, period!

5511
04:41:18,610 --> 04:41:19,270
Mint's cute.

5512
04:41:19,450 --> 04:41:20,990
I'm excited for all that's next.

5513
04:41:21,110 --> 04:41:21,310
What?

5514
04:41:21,430 --> 04:41:22,050
No way!

5515
04:41:22,890 --> 04:41:25,530
You stopped being a Lurker because I came back?

5516
04:41:37,690 --> 04:41:38,570
Thank you!

5517
04:41:40,370 --> 04:41:45,430
But that's not to say also if you Lurk, you know, that you have to stop lurking.

5518
04:41:45,550 --> 04:41:48,050
I appreciate everybody who watches at all.

5519
04:41:48,190 --> 04:41:50,250
Even you, Vaude Watcher.

5520
04:41:50,270 --> 04:41:52,830
I don't even know if a Vaude Watcher would still be listening.

5521
04:41:54,830 --> 04:41:58,490
But, you know, Lurkers, still a Lurker.

5522
04:41:59,550 --> 04:42:00,370
Not anymore!

5523
04:42:00,490 --> 04:42:01,390
I see you.

5524
04:42:01,610 --> 04:42:02,950
Not so common sense.

5525
04:42:05,350 --> 04:42:28,790
But, you know, if you, if you, if you, if you've been watching since I first debuted, if you came in between heaven, if you came after heaven, if you lurk, if you chat all day every day, if you spam in my chat, if you have weird names like, please pee on me,

5526
04:42:28,810 --> 04:42:37,090
Mint Phantom, if you, if you have, if you, I don't know, where was I going?

5527
04:42:38,250 --> 04:42:40,110
Anyways, I appreciate you guys.

5528
04:42:42,850 --> 04:42:44,250
Mint Appreciation Tax.

5529
04:42:44,710 --> 04:42:45,270
Boopie!

5530
04:42:46,990 --> 04:42:48,750
You changed your profile picture.

5531
04:42:50,050 --> 04:42:50,890
What is that?

5532
04:42:53,290 --> 04:42:53,850
Bustin.

5533
04:42:54,150 --> 04:42:55,310
She loves us.

5534
04:42:58,130 --> 04:42:59,210
I'm a newer subscriber.

5535
04:42:59,870 --> 04:43:02,110
I'll be happy to stick around for as long as you need your fans.

5536
04:43:02,230 --> 04:43:02,810
Thank you!

5537
04:43:05,210 --> 04:43:06,130
Thank you.

5538
04:43:07,330 --> 04:43:10,850
Yeah, if you came, if you started watching after I came back, yeah.

5539
04:43:13,190 --> 04:43:19,350
Um, Matara and I kind of covered, talked about this, I think in the Patreon episode.

5540
04:43:19,670 --> 04:43:23,850
But someone asked a question on Patreon, of the podcast Patreon.

5541
04:43:24,230 --> 04:43:29,030
They were like, when do I become a Wisp or a or a Momo?

5542
04:43:29,250 --> 04:43:32,170
Since Matara's fanbase is called Momos.

5543
04:43:33,150 --> 04:43:35,270
They were like, when do you become a Wisp or a Momo?

5544
04:43:35,270 --> 04:43:36,470
Is it when you donate?

5545
04:43:36,750 --> 04:43:37,710
Is it when you chat?

5546
04:43:37,990 --> 04:43:39,090
Is it when you...

5547
04:43:39,090 --> 04:43:40,390
Oh my gosh, frog.

5548
04:43:45,410 --> 04:43:46,270
Thank you for the pig!

5549
04:43:47,770 --> 04:43:48,890
And I was like...

5550
04:43:48,890 --> 04:43:49,850
It's like, no!

5551
04:43:51,010 --> 04:43:52,390
They were like, were you a Mo...

5552
04:43:52,390 --> 04:43:54,050
Do you have to be a Momo from day one?

5553
04:43:54,190 --> 04:43:54,610
It's like, no!

5554
04:43:56,090 --> 04:43:57,830
I joined a softball team.

5555
04:43:57,870 --> 04:43:59,310
I'm baseball field now!

5556
04:43:59,310 --> 04:43:59,870
Hahaha!

5557
04:44:07,680 --> 04:44:10,020
When you sacrifice your soul.

5558
04:44:10,300 --> 04:44:11,180
Pretty much.

5559
04:44:13,300 --> 04:44:20,840
As soon as you take a step in here and allow me to absorb a little bit of your life energy, you're basically a Wisp.

5560
04:44:23,560 --> 04:44:26,220
Whoever that was, I was baseball field too.

5561
04:44:29,780 --> 04:44:30,860
We love Minto!

5562
04:44:31,140 --> 04:44:32,080
Thank you!

5563
04:44:34,040 --> 04:44:34,160
Kyle!

5564
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:35,120
Welcome!

5565
04:44:35,740 --> 04:44:36,620
Welcome back!

5566
04:44:38,480 --> 04:44:40,860
Was also a lurker vodwatcher until your comeback.

5567
04:44:41,040 --> 04:44:42,840
Didn't want to miss out this time either.

5568
04:44:43,100 --> 04:44:43,780
No way!

5569
04:44:45,400 --> 04:44:46,460
That's so crazy.

5570
04:44:48,320 --> 04:44:49,620
That's so so crazy.

5571
04:44:53,280 --> 04:44:55,240
But again, you know, just being here.

5572
04:44:57,560 --> 04:44:58,660
You don't miss now.

5573
04:45:00,900 --> 04:45:01,660
I think.

5574
04:45:02,620 --> 04:45:03,180
Pyrobot!

5575
04:45:04,040 --> 04:45:04,180
I'm a gift!

5576
04:45:05,060 --> 04:45:07,200
But yeah, you know, I'm just...

5577
04:45:08,680 --> 04:45:09,700
Usually lurk.

5578
04:45:09,700 --> 04:45:11,960
I'm just watching you while farming runes.

5579
04:45:12,080 --> 04:45:12,400
Hahaha!

5580
04:45:12,980 --> 04:45:14,740
Keep farming them runes.

5581
04:45:18,240 --> 04:45:24,060
So if our official fan name is Wisp, I would like to propose we canonize the name Pissy Wispy.

5582
04:45:25,980 --> 04:45:27,040
V Toad!

5583
04:45:27,040 --> 04:45:27,740
V Toad!

5584
04:45:27,840 --> 04:45:29,000
V Toad!

5585
04:45:29,300 --> 04:45:30,340
V Toad!

5586
04:45:30,340 --> 04:45:31,020
V Toad!

5587
04:45:31,020 --> 04:45:32,420
V Toad!

5588
04:45:32,420 --> 04:45:33,040
V Toad!

5589
04:45:33,040 --> 04:45:33,640
V Toad!

5590
04:45:33,640 --> 04:45:34,220
V Toad!

5591
04:45:34,220 --> 04:45:35,400
V Toad!

5592
04:45:40,940 --> 04:45:41,440
Minto?

5593
04:45:43,000 --> 04:45:44,980
V Toad!

5594
04:46:02,140 --> 04:46:03,380
Majority vote.

5595
04:46:03,600 --> 04:46:05,320
No, this is not democracy!

5596
04:46:06,280 --> 04:46:06,780
No!

5597
04:46:07,980 --> 04:46:08,320
No!

5598
04:46:08,320 --> 04:46:08,440
No!

5599
04:46:09,660 --> 04:46:11,620
That was bad posting, Oshijito.

5600
04:46:15,340 --> 04:46:19,820
Yeah, let's just ignore that and keep on keeping on.

5601
04:46:22,400 --> 04:46:24,420
Oh, I just... Sorry, I did not see you.

5602
04:46:24,520 --> 04:46:25,500
Phantom Inc.

5603
04:46:25,700 --> 04:46:26,900
Thanks for the gifted membership!

5604
04:46:27,740 --> 04:46:34,620
Sorry if I missed donos and stuff while I was playing because sometimes it was hard to...

5605
04:46:36,080 --> 04:46:40,520
hard to re-chat and also avoid all of these guys.

5606
04:46:43,940 --> 04:46:47,200
If you Vetoed, does that make you a Peace Walker?

5607
04:46:47,300 --> 04:46:50,340
Oh wait, if you're Vetoed, does that make you a Peace Walker?

5608
04:46:50,700 --> 04:46:53,760
I like it.

5609
04:46:58,490 --> 04:46:59,750
She hates us.

5610
04:47:02,070 --> 04:47:02,630
Frogbert?

5611
04:47:02,990 --> 04:47:04,910
Frogbert is not Vetoed.

5612
04:47:05,150 --> 04:47:07,630
He is Webtoed.

5613
04:47:08,330 --> 04:47:10,350
Oh my god, he's chronically online.

5614
04:47:10,730 --> 04:47:13,410
He's chronically on the World Wide Webtoed.

5615
04:47:14,030 --> 04:47:17,450
Oh my gosh, that's what, you know, that's what like a feet...

5616
04:47:17,450 --> 04:47:18,550
a feet...

5617
04:47:18,550 --> 04:47:19,970
a feet...

5618
04:47:19,970 --> 04:47:20,910
a feet...

5619
04:47:21,770 --> 04:47:22,870
a feet...

5620
04:47:23,610 --> 04:47:24,430
a feet...

5621
04:47:24,430 --> 04:47:27,530
a frog feet wiki would be called.

5622
04:47:28,690 --> 04:47:29,370
Webtoes.

5623
04:47:37,120 --> 04:47:38,400
Hey cutie.

5624
04:47:40,440 --> 04:47:42,040
Hey meaches fries.

5625
04:47:42,860 --> 04:47:45,720
Your name is cut off, but is it still Mint Slice?

5626
04:47:49,660 --> 04:47:51,800
Someone reboot the mage you stuck on re...

5627
04:47:51,800 --> 04:47:52,560
feet?

5628
04:47:55,700 --> 04:47:58,600
Very glad to get to see you stream your...

5629
04:47:58,600 --> 04:47:59,980
and enjoy yourself.

5630
04:48:01,500 --> 04:48:03,220
For however long that works for you.

5631
04:48:03,320 --> 04:48:05,780
Listening to you up here or the podcast is a pleasure.

5632
04:48:05,880 --> 04:48:07,640
Miss Mint Fan Toilet.

5633
04:48:22,080 --> 04:48:24,780
That might be the worst nickname ever to come out.

5634
04:48:28,520 --> 04:48:30,180
That might be actually...

5635
04:48:31,700 --> 04:48:34,740
the worstest nickname anybody could have given that to me.

5636
04:48:37,280 --> 04:48:38,540
Can you keep saying feet?

5637
04:48:39,020 --> 04:48:39,920
Feet, feet, feet.

5638
04:48:40,540 --> 04:48:42,400
Feet, feet, feet, feet, feet.

5639
04:48:42,780 --> 04:48:45,180
Feet, feet, feet, feet, feet, feet, feet.

5640
04:48:45,180 --> 04:48:48,420
Feet, feet, feet, feet, feet, feet, feet.

5641
04:48:48,520 --> 04:48:50,440
Feet, feet, feet, feet, feet, feet.

5642
04:48:50,760 --> 04:48:53,280
Feet, feet, feet, feet, feet, feet, feet.

5643
04:48:54,240 --> 04:48:54,760
Feet.

5644
04:48:58,920 --> 04:48:59,440
Feet.

5645
04:49:02,660 --> 04:49:03,180
Feet.

5646
04:49:03,760 --> 04:49:03,940
Feet.

5647
04:49:18,170 --> 04:49:18,690
Feet.

5648
04:49:18,990 --> 04:49:19,390
Feet.

5649
04:49:19,390 --> 04:49:19,410
Feet.

5650
04:49:19,410 --> 04:49:19,470
Feet.

5651
04:49:19,470 --> 04:49:19,490
Feet.

5652
04:49:22,770 --> 04:49:23,290
Feet.

5653
04:49:23,290 --> 04:49:24,070
Oh my gosh!

5654
04:49:24,230 --> 04:49:25,570
I just realized the time!

5655
04:49:26,210 --> 04:49:27,270
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

5656
04:49:28,190 --> 04:49:29,130
I'm gonna go to bed!

5657
04:49:30,690 --> 04:49:34,190
Thank you guys again for joining me for...

5658
04:49:34,190 --> 04:49:36,410
almost five hours of...

5659
04:49:38,070 --> 04:49:40,010
Why did I have to zoom in on the face?

5660
04:49:45,550 --> 04:49:47,290
Thank you guys for hanging out with me.

5661
04:49:47,450 --> 04:49:48,630
I hope you guys have fun.

5662
04:49:48,790 --> 04:49:51,470
I hope you guys have a nice... night?

5663
04:49:53,310 --> 04:49:53,750
Morning?

5664
04:49:53,750 --> 04:49:54,190
Afternoon?

5665
04:49:54,250 --> 04:49:55,330
Whatever time it is.

5666
04:49:55,410 --> 04:49:56,190
For you!

5667
04:50:00,050 --> 04:50:00,750
Oh, wait!

5668
04:50:01,270 --> 04:50:02,150
Ashes, thank you!

5669
04:50:02,310 --> 04:50:02,730
Oh my gosh.

5670
04:50:03,930 --> 04:50:07,410
Only just started interacting because I'm very shy despite watching you since debut.

5671
04:50:08,710 --> 04:50:09,590
Don't worry, me too.

5672
04:50:09,690 --> 04:50:11,450
If you think you're shy, I'm more shy.

5673
04:50:12,430 --> 04:50:14,770
Thank you for always having such a kind space.

5674
04:50:21,550 --> 04:50:23,450
Ever since you came back, I've met other Wisps.

5675
04:50:23,470 --> 04:50:24,570
Went to my first concert.

5676
04:50:25,610 --> 04:50:27,290
And even got my first penlight.

5677
04:50:27,350 --> 04:50:28,390
Thanks for being around me.

5678
04:50:28,470 --> 04:50:28,930
Oh my gosh!

5679
04:50:29,430 --> 04:50:30,370
We have a danger!

5680
04:50:30,910 --> 04:50:31,450
Thank you!

5681
04:50:33,510 --> 04:50:34,670
Do we have to duke it out?

5682
04:50:34,810 --> 04:50:34,990
No.

5683
04:50:35,170 --> 04:50:35,510
Wait.

5684
04:50:36,190 --> 04:50:36,530
Maybe?

5685
04:50:37,050 --> 04:50:37,650
If you want.

5686
04:50:38,070 --> 04:50:40,430
Yulian, I don't know if yours will show up because it might be...

5687
04:50:41,490 --> 04:50:42,510
It might be buried.

5688
04:50:43,890 --> 04:50:45,430
You've done so much these past three months.

5689
04:50:45,470 --> 04:50:46,070
So proud of you.

5690
04:50:46,130 --> 04:50:47,890
It's okay to take your time figuring things out.

5691
04:50:47,990 --> 04:50:48,710
No need to rush.

5692
04:50:48,850 --> 04:50:50,790
As long as you're happy doing what you want.

5693
04:50:50,790 --> 04:50:53,090
We're happy and we'll support whatever direction you want to go.

5694
04:50:53,170 --> 04:50:53,990
Love you, Minto.

5695
04:50:54,530 --> 04:50:55,170
Thank you!

5696
04:50:57,950 --> 04:50:58,950
First penlight.

5697
04:50:59,090 --> 04:51:00,290
That's always so exciting.

5698
04:51:04,530 --> 04:51:05,030
Thanks.

5699
04:51:07,790 --> 04:51:08,850
That's the one I just read.

5700
04:51:10,650 --> 04:51:13,730
Hey Mint, your double finger gun is pretty good.

5701
04:51:15,350 --> 04:51:15,970
Thank you!

5702
04:51:17,410 --> 04:51:17,910
George.

5703
04:51:20,790 --> 04:51:21,570
Good night, Minto.

5704
04:51:21,630 --> 04:51:22,410
I look forward to seeing you.

5705
04:51:22,490 --> 04:51:23,230
I'm Otaku-tan.

5706
04:51:23,630 --> 04:51:24,270
Thank you!

5707
04:51:25,730 --> 04:51:26,630
See you there.

5708
04:51:30,330 --> 04:51:32,890
Actually, it's funny you bring up the double finger guns.

5709
04:51:33,030 --> 04:51:38,190
Because you may enjoy a new emote coming out.

5710
04:51:41,210 --> 04:51:42,270
And that's all.

5711
04:51:42,430 --> 04:51:43,510
I will say...

5712
04:51:43,510 --> 04:51:45,130
Thank you everybody for watching.

5713
04:51:45,210 --> 04:51:46,170
Thanks for hanging out.

5714
04:51:46,310 --> 04:51:48,570
I really, really, really, really appreciate it.

5715
04:51:48,710 --> 04:51:50,210
Thank you so much!

5716
04:51:53,130 --> 04:51:54,970
And yeah, have a good day.

5717
04:51:54,990 --> 04:51:55,550
Have a good night.

5718
04:51:56,030 --> 04:51:56,850
Have a good day!

5719
04:51:58,870 --> 04:52:01,430
And I'll see you guys next time!

5720
04:52:01,770 --> 04:52:02,690
Bye-bye!

5721
04:52:03,070 --> 04:52:04,550
Good night!

5722
04:52:06,070 --> 04:52:07,110
Bye-bye!

5723
04:53:25,680 --> 04:53:27,980
I forgot to say Otu Minto.

5724
04:53:28,160 --> 04:53:29,000
Have a good night.

5725
04:53:29,620 --> 04:53:31,500
Have a good night.

5726
04:53:32,000 --> 04:53:34,780
I forgot to say Otu Minto.

5727
04:53:38,600 --> 04:53:39,800
I forgot to say Otu Minto.

5728
04:53:39,800 --> 04:53:40,080
Have a good night.

5729
04:53:40,760 --> 04:53:41,540
Good night!

5730
04:53:42,700 --> 04:53:42,820
Have a good night everyone!

5731
04:53:43,340 --> 04:53:44,080
Good night everyone!

5732
04:53:46,160 --> 04:53:47,040
You guys!

5733
04:53:47,140 --> 04:53:50,680
prior thing today that allowed me to move my hands 3D!

5734
04:53:51,800 --> 04:53:52,360
Yup~~
