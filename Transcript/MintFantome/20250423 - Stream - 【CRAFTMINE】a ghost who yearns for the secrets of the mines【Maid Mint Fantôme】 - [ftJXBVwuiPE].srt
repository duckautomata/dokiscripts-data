00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:30,990
Thank you.

3
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,710
Hello everyone.

4
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,310
Hi, hi, hi.

5
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,070
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

6
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,490
Hi welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

7
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,730
Welcome back to CraftMine.

8
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,810
Woo woo woo!

9
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,710
Yippee.

10
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,970
Hello, hello, hello.

11
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,390
Yes.

12
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,050
Welcome.

13
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,310
How is Minky feeling?

14
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,210
I'm... 6 out of 10.

15
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,530
You're a blessing.

16
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,090
Of course.

17
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,950
Thank you so much for the 5 gift.

18
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,490
Before I get too much in, you guys.

19
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,990
It has been shown.

20
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:40,790
I have this Friday... This Friday, I have my first ever Gamersupps merch drop.

21
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:48,850
And they just now showed the design.

22
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,050
So I'm going to show you guys.

23
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,650
No skip a ad.

24
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,410
No skip a ad.

25
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,730
Are you guys ready?

26
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,350
Oh wait.

27
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,630
I did it the wrong way.

28
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,010
It's supposed to be the front on the...

29
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,130
On the... On the left side.

30
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,710
It's fine.

31
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,090
Whatever.

32
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,950
Look at that.

33
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,990
Wowee.

34
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,030
And then... And then you see the parts that are like kind of mint?

35
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,630
Whatever you... Whatever drink you have in there.

36
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,930
If it's red or blue or green or...

37
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,790
Whatever color...

38
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,330
Whatever color...

39
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,350
Um... It changes the colors... As well.

40
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,030
So it's a little...

41
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,730
Customizable Minto.

42
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,010
Yeah.

43
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,350
Yeah.

44
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,730
Yeah.

45
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,650
Yeah.

46
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,310
Yeah.

47
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,310
Yeah.

48
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,570
Yeah.

49
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,570
And then... And then you can also get the design...

50
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,030
Brrrrr... As a t-shirt!

51
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,070
Whoa...

52
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,810
Actually... The t-shirt is so much more soft than I imagined.

53
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,850
It's actually so nice.

54
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,610
I got mine...

55
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,090
A while ago.

56
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,290
I wear it to bed.

57
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,650
So, yeah.

58
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,390
I'm gonna wear that in public.

59
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,430
You totally can!

60
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,850
You totally can!

61
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,710
Or you could wear it anywhere.

62
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,370
You can wear it!

63
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,550
Nyah!

64
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,680
No spamming, please!

65
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,440
Yes, yes, yes!

66
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,400
And then also... Oops, I didn't mean to get rid of it.

67
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,360
And then also, there is a... A mouse pad!

68
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,380
Where I am skateboarding!

69
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,880
And it's so cool!

70
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,540
Wow!

71
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,180
Even though I never skateboard before.

72
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm a bit of a...

73
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,340
But, I did inline skating.

74
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
Which I like heat better, to be honest.

75
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,040
But, made skateboarding is like the thing.

76
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,520
And if you like the skateboard, you can get your own... Oh, sorry.

77
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,780
The size.

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,860
You can get your own fingerboard!

79
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,860
Whoa!

80
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,380
Wowee!

81
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,320
So, you can... You can do sick tricks with your Mito fingerboard!

82
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,060
Yeah!

83
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,820
Yeah, so I have some merch coming out on Friday.

84
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,700
Of course, I'll...

85
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,180
Thank you!

86
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,720
Thank you!

87
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,100
Thank you!

88
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:59,060
Thank you!

89
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,220
But also, I couldn't... I couldn't... When they sent me the design, I couldn't pass up... Like, look.

90
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,220
I couldn't pass up on the... The idea of being able to change the panty color.

91
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,900
Like, I was like, wait a second.

92
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,300
That's so genius!

93
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,300
Like, at first, they had it where it was just white.

94
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,180
And I was like, wait.

95
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,620
Can you make it see-through?

96
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,780
So that... Because originally, I was gonna be like, ah, maybe I don't want my butt out on a cup.

97
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,580
But then I was like... I was like, wait.

98
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,000
But if you make it see-through, then you can change the panty colors.

99
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
And so I was like, can you do that?

100
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,900
And they were like, yeah.

101
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,520
I was like, yeah!

102
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
And you can put any drink in there as well.

103
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,340
You could drink orange juice.

104
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,760
You could drink... You could drink any kind of drink.

105
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,700
You could drink... You could drink... Mountain Dew.

106
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,800
One board for each finger.

107
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,400
Yeah, my see-through panty.

108
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,080
That's very ghosty, you know?

109
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,260
You could do milk.

110
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,100
Yeah, you could.

111
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,580
But then they would just be white.

112
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,780
The freak overpowered the embarrassment.

113
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,540
It's true.

114
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Yeah.

115
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,460
Baja Blast.

116
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,060
That would actually look so good, no?

117
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,340
Strawberry milk?

118
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,520
See?

119
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:38,940
See?

120
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,200
You guys are cooking now.

121
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,980
You guys are cooking.

122
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,380
So if you could purchase your very own Minky Cup, that would be very awesome.

123
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,160
And helpful to me as well.

124
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,260
Yeah!

125
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,740
And for everybody who has used my code BOOMERONGAMERSUP so far, thank you, guys.

126
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,100
Thank you very, very, very much.

127
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,960
Really appreciate it.

128
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,660
Do I get a Minto Desk Mat or a 2B one?

129
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,280
Well, if you're asking me, I'd say Minto Desk Mat.

130
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,460
I don't think 2B will tell you to get a 2B Desk Mat.

131
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,240
But I can say, Kamori Asani, thank you for the super chat.

132
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,220
And also, you should get the Minto Desk Mat.

133
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,460
Because I'm directly telling you to your face right now.

134
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,900
No!

135
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,260
Yeah!

136
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,380
To be or not to be.

137
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,280
Definitely not to be.

138
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,800
Get that out of there.

139
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,540
You're so right!

140
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,720
Yeah!

141
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,300
So this will all be up on Friday.

142
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,660
So...

143
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,000
And if you're embarrassed about the back of the shirt, you can always wear a jacket.

144
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,840
But don't be embarrassed.

145
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,000
Let your freak flag fly, baby.

146
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,060
Oh, and then...

147
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,740
You can kind of see it here.

148
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:23,220
The front says, And then, the other side says, So, it's very maid-like and proper.

149
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,080
And look!

150
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
Look, the little wisp has even a bandana.

151
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,220
It's so cute.

152
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,160
So...

153
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,940
Mm-hmm.

154
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,100
Very proper.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,680
Yeah!

156
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,980
He does!

158
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,780
He does!

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,000
It's so cute, no?

160
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,460
So...

161
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:46,520
Mm.

162
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,760
Um...

163
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,040
Yeah!

164
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,880
So...

165
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Good...

166
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,120
Friday.

167
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,360
But today...

168
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,020
Mine...

169
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,720
Uh, Craft Mine.

170
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,580
Craft Mine.

171
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,160
Craft Mine.

172
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,580
So I did Craft Mine...

173
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,640
Uh...

174
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,760
Last time...

175
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,380
I want to play...

176
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,960
I wanted to play just a little bit more.

177
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Since it was, like, you know...

178
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,280
But I think I...

179
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,980
I think I'm, like, in a...

180
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,440
Random place.

181
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,480
I think I'm in, like, a mine.

182
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,020
Last time I left off.

183
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,020
And I have to find the exit.

184
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,680
I think I got, like, caught up.

186
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,080
So we gotta find the exit to this place.

187
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,200
I gotta get some...

188
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,100
I gotta get some stuff.

189
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,180
Is this like Minecraft?

190
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,600
Yes, but it's Craft Mine.

191
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,680
It's, like...

192
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
So different.

193
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,240
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,940
Oh, yes!

196
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,880
My pickaxe swinging from side to side.

197
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,380
Oh!

198
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,420
So...

199
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,380
So we back in the mine.

200
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,160
Swinging my pickaxe from side to side.

201
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,840
That's what I'm doing.

202
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,420
Wait, maybe we stick with one tree.

203
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,520
Open our Minecraft mood.

204
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,260
Maybe I need to play some Craft Mine.

205
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
It's enough...

206
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,260
It's a different enough of an experience that it feels...

207
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,540
Different and new and fun.

208
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,220
You know what I mean?

209
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,240
Although, I don't remember how to do much.

210
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,140
So...

211
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,620
I'm gonna have to remember how to play this.

212
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,500
Let's see.

213
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,340
Okay, so...

214
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,420
For those who didn't see last week...

215
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,500
See how things are kinda weird, no?

216
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,500
We...

217
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,680
Have to...

218
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,020
Oh, and I have to unlock things.

219
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,140
But I don't remember...

220
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,580
Was it V?

221
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,540
No.

222
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,560
You?

223
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,360
Yes, you is up a grade.

224
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,920
I'm from Colombia.

225
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,120
Is it possible...

226
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,520
To get them...

227
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,480
Mouse Phantom Pad?

228
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,040
Suikyo!

229
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,560
Suikyo!

230
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,120
I...

231
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,740
I don't know...

232
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,340
Um...

233
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,980
That's a...

234
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,060
Gamersubs question.

235
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,760
Because they're the ones shipping it.

236
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,020
So...

237
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,220
Um...

238
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,060
Honestly...

239
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,380
Unfortunately, I can't...

240
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,940
Like, I don't know where they ship to.

241
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,980
But I feel like they probably...

242
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,900
Would ship there.

243
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,820
Maybe.

244
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,620
So...

245
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,060
Each...

246
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,080
So basically...

247
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,400
In Craft Mine...

248
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,340
You craft...

249
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,080
Your own mine...

250
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:26,960
Oh yeah!

251
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,680
I have Double Jump!

252
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,120
I forgot!

253
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,160
You craft your own mine...

254
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,760
And then...

255
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,500
You have to...

256
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,660
Find the escape.

257
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,880
So currently...

258
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,560
I have tried to...

259
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,180
Escape.

260
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,340
Can you hear me...

261
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,000
Jumping...

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,520
With my keyboard?

263
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,620
Wow!

264
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,760
Double Jump is crazy!

265
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,880
You can't!

266
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,980
Oh, that's so funny.

267
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,200
Clacka clacka!

268
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,380
Oh, you can?

269
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:57,900
Haha!

270
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,980
And then...

271
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,300
I think it also...

272
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,280
It does help with...

273
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,560
Fall damage.

274
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,140
Oh my god!

275
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,540
Crazy!

276
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,120
Ouch!

277
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,640
Nevermind!

278
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,780
Um...

279
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,840
Oh no!

280
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,780
It's starting to get dark!

281
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,520
Oh no!

282
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,240
Wait!

283
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,080
Um...

284
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,160
One thing about this...

285
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,880
Is you can't sleep in the game...

286
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,020
Unless I have like no...

287
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,400
I have no food!

288
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh golly!

289
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,400
Okay!

290
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,340
Um...

291
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,560
Let's do some upgrades...

292
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,580
While I'm on the ice...

293
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,180
Oh!

294
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,500
I only have three levels!

295
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,220
Uh oh!

296
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,640
Nevermind!

297
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,760
I can't do any upgrades!

298
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,980
Literally not...

299
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,840
I think a single thing!

300
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,520
Oh wait!

301
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,080
I could do...

302
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,240
Increase my luck while fishing?

303
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,810
I can't do anything!

304
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,450
Nevermind!

305
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,790
Let's not upgrade!

306
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,870
Let's survive the night!

307
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,270
Let's...

308
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,810
Uh...

309
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,050
Make ourselves a sword?

310
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,670
What?

311
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,870
What?

312
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,770
So basically...

313
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,470
I had to unlock the ability...

314
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,190
To be able to...

315
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,590
Make these things...

316
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,490
Or make a crafting table...

317
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,070
You have to unlock abilities...

318
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,190
In this version...

319
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,210
It's very strange...

320
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,070
Oh!

321
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,970
I can make a boat!

322
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,230
That would be good too!

323
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,590
Especially because...

324
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,970
I don't know recipes...

325
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,490
So it was very hard at first...

326
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,370
For me to...

327
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,470
Understand this...

328
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,590
Your Oshimike was talking about Chicken Jockey...

329
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,990
Yes!

330
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,750
I watched that...

331
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,350
Matt...

332
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,170
I watched...

333
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,730
Red Letter Media...

334
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,630
And I watched...

335
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,510
Him talk about Chicken Jockey...

336
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,290
But they left the movie theater early...

337
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,790
They like got...

338
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,610
So...

339
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,650
Red Letter Media...

340
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,410
My Oshimike's...

341
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,290
Mike's the Closso...

342
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,570
They talked about the Minecraft movie...

343
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,650
And I kind of agree with his opinion...

344
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,370
In that...

345
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,390
So basically...

346
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,930
He was like...

347
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,270
I'm fine...

348
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,830
With...

349
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,490
The chaos that is happening...

350
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,850
At the movie theaters...

351
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,090
Which...

352
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,890
I don't agree with that part...

353
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,170
I think it's...

354
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:16,430
You know...

355
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,770
You don't have to make a mess...

356
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,330
For the...

357
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,290
For the poor employees...

358
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,410
But...

359
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,370
Oh my god!

360
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,050
We found it!

361
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,290
Let's go!

362
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,530
But...

363
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,890
His thing was kind of like...

364
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,230
You know...

365
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,290
Whatever gets...

366
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,990
More people going back to the movie theaters...

367
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,230
Is a good thing...

368
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,610
They were just happy to see people going to see a movie...

369
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:37,770
Yeah!

370
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,330
Exactly!

371
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,910
So I...

372
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,150
I actually get it...

373
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,990
And...

374
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,730
I mean...

375
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,030
I'm...

376
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,690
I'm...

377
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,230
Not part of the solution...

378
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,490
I don't go to the movies either...

379
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,030
But I also don't go outside...

380
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,670
Very...

381
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,990
Really either...

382
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,670
So...

383
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,810
I finished their video halfway through...

384
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,290
To pay respects...

385
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,210
To them leaving the cinema early...

386
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,310
So true...

387
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,710
So true...

388
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,590
So before we leave...

389
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,690
I want to gather some extra supplies...

390
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,930
So maybe we can...

391
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,290
Get some extra points...

392
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,010
You know...

393
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,010
And other...

394
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,490
Things unlocked...

395
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:16,770
Maybe...

396
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,050
Uh...

397
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,210
Am I reading any new books lately?

398
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,150
You know, Brian?

399
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,050
I really haven't...

400
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,050
I haven't had much time...

401
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,510
I recently watched it...

402
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,870
And our theater wasn't super crazy...

403
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,350
But a small child did shout out...

404
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,790
Chicken Jockey and Crafting Table...

405
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,390
Alongside Mr. Black...

406
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:33,570
See?

407
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,910
That's so cute though...

408
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,070
No!

409
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,750
I think that's okay...

410
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,870
That feels wholesome...

411
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,290
At least...

412
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,550
I'm afraid to go though...

413
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,590
Because I don't want to get...

414
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,990
I don't want to get like...

415
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,510
Some...

416
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,350
Some soda thrown at me...

417
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,340
Or something like that...

418
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,720
So I'm afraid...

419
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,700
What else?

420
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,920
Oh, let's try...

421
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,660
I don't see any creatures here...

422
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,340
So maybe we can get some mushroom...

423
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,380
Come on, mushroom...

424
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,380
Trying to get a mushroom...

425
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,680
There was like...

426
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
One of the achievements...

427
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,380
Was a mushroom thingy...

428
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,050
Went to the theater to see...

429
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:28,830
Gundam...

430
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,090
So the solution...

431
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,550
At least for me...

432
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,410
Is to have more giant robot movies...

433
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,910
And how many people...

434
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,310
Were in there with you...

435
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,510
Fairly...

436
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,390
How many people...

437
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,410
Also went to go see the movie...

438
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,010
What is it pronounced?

439
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,390
Dang it...

440
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,410
Still no...

441
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,060
Q...

442
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,940
G...

443
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,140
Quacks...

444
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,780
G-Quacks...

445
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,780
Anyone see...

446
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,740
The Miku movie...

447
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,340
Oh, the...

448
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,840
Project Sekai movie...

449
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,060
Miku movie...

450
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,860
Miku movie...

451
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,980
Miku movie...

452
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,100
I haven't...

453
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,520
I've...

454
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,040
I literally have not gone to...

455
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,840
The movie theater to see anything...

456
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,900
You're watching it today...

457
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,880
The Miku movie...

458
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,300
Minto movie...

459
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,100
No...

460
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,000
You know...

461
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
Back in the past...

462
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,980
I used to say...

463
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,920
I used to say...

464
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,900
I used to be really adamant...

465
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,680
I used to be like...

466
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,020
I...

467
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,240
If I ever had a movie made about me...

468
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,060
I would want Jack Black...

469
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,020
To play me...

470
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,440
You know...

471
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,580
I would want him...

472
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,220
To...

473
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,620
To...

474
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,720
Be the role of Mint Phantom...

475
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,630
And now I think I might...

476
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,160
I...

477
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,980
I...

478
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,760
I...

479
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,040
I...

480
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,600
I don't...

481
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,780
Um...

482
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,980
Wow, there's so many spitters here...

483
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,420
I...

484
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,620
It's not that I don't want...

485
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,460
Him to do it anymore...

486
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,220
It's just that...

487
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,500
I just...

488
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,400
I wonder if it would be...

489
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,420
If it would be like...

490
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh...

491
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,360
Jack Black is in the movie...

492
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,200
But the Minecraft movie is not a flop...

493
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,800
I was gonna say...

494
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,760
Jack Black is in the movie...

495
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,320
It's a flop...

496
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,920
But...

497
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,620
I don't know...

498
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,120
Weird Al as Dokki Bird...

499
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,620
This is kind of insane...

500
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,160
Wait...

501
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,600
I want Weird Al...

502
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
I want Weird Al in the movie...

503
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,540
Sweet...

504
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,120
Finished Blueprints because of your streams...

505
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,840
And that genuinely...

506
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,360
Felt like three to four books...

507
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,080
In a single video game...

508
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,600
How long did it take here...

509
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,180
To finish...

510
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,780
I want to get the...

511
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,380
Hold on...

512
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,940
I don't want that guy to get me...

513
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,600
But I want to get the Fireflies...

514
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,780
Trying to get more stuff so that...

515
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,240
Oh my gosh...

516
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Nevermind...

517
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
I can't see anything...

518
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,240
It's so dark...

519
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,680
And it's so...

520
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,500
I don't know if these give us anything...

521
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,600
Guess not...

522
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,780
You are not soon...

523
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,620
Jack Black Minto...

524
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,640
Good morning Minto...

525
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,720
He would say that in the movie...

526
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,370
Okay...

527
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,670
I guess we can just leave this world...

528
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,610
40 days...

529
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,050
If Gilbert Gottfried was still alive...

530
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,810
He'd be the perfect...

531
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,070
Jokey...

532
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,850
Why do you...

533
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,710
Why?

534
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,250
Because he played a bird...

535
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,730
Once...

536
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,150
Once...

537
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,510
He played one bird...

538
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,770
And...

539
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:51,870
That...

540
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,510
That makes him qualify...

541
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,570
Zendaya as...

542
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,510
That I can see...

543
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,350
That I can see...

544
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,530
Jack Black saying...

545
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,610
Oishiku naire moimoi...

546
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,550
Cute needs to happen...

547
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,730
Like I still love Jack Black...

548
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,070
But...

549
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,510
My only thing is...

550
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,570
I feel like...

551
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,550
With the Minecraft movie...

552
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,170
How do I say this?

553
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:17,770
Arigato...

554
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:18,890
Arigato...

555
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,190
Thank you...

556
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,570
Oh my gosh...

557
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,470
That was so loud...

558
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,010
Two months ago...

559
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,150
I got this VTuber themed...

560
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,750
Green Thanksgiving candle...

561
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,230
In a mug...

562
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,070
After two years of...

563
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,610
Transit from Japan...

564
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,230
It's cute...

565
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,950
And it smells so good...

566
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,050
I had to get it shipped to me...

567
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,710
A couple times...

568
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,670
But it was worth it...

569
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:33,570
Say...

570
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,050
Oh my gosh...

571
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,350
I haven't seen you ever...

572
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,030
Thank you...

573
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,910
Thank you...

574
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,170
So much...

575
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,830
Thank you...

576
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,330
Oh there's...

577
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,330
Places crawling with skellies...

578
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,020
But I want the mushroom...

579
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,130
I don't really have like...

580
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:51,630
A shield...

581
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,210
And my health is not...

582
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,010
Good enough...

583
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,850
But the sun is starting to come out...

584
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,370
What was I saying though?

585
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,330
Oh...

586
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,990
It's not that I...

587
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,830
I feel...

588
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,950
I fear...

589
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,880
Jack Black is just playing himself...

590
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,150
In most of these movies now...

591
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:06,690
You know what I mean?

592
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,950
So would he embody...

593
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,510
Mint Fanta?

594
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,370
Or would he just be...

595
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,030
Jack Black...

596
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,810
Wearing Mint Fanta...

597
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:15,930
Outfit...

598
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,430
You know what I mean?

599
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,370
I've seen the Mint Fanta movie...

600
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,170
Starring Jack Black...

601
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,570
Weird...

602
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,710
I know I've read that as...

603
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,570
Weird I...

604
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,790
Like AI...

605
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,170
And Jason Momoa...

606
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,290
No...

607
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,250
Maybe we can get this one...

608
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,810
Doesn't seem like there's anything here...

609
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,350
Um...

610
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,730
Yeah, I just fear...

611
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,670
That it would be...

612
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,650
Jack Black...

613
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,610
Wearing...

614
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,170
My outfit...

615
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,270
And not actually being like...

616
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,250
I am...

617
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,330
I...

618
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,910
I am Minto...

619
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,410
You know?

620
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,550
So...

621
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,430
Hmm...

622
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,270
It's just one of those...

623
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,970
One of those things...

624
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,990
Hello from Philippines...

625
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,090
Hello from Philippines...

626
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,130
Hello!

627
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,690
Thank you!

628
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,010
My pick for Mint Phantom is Willem Dafoe...

629
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,210
Is that the guy with the...

630
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,470
Like...

631
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,530
The...

632
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,690
The guy that...

633
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,970
That...

634
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,290
That...

635
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,610
He...

636
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,210
Yes, okay...

637
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,210
I'm just making sure...

638
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,970
Now...

639
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,150
Why?

640
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,290
Why?

641
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,670
Green Goblin...

642
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,670
Wait, that's right!

643
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,370
I gotta get dirt, don't I?

644
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,650
Wait, let's make...

645
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,030
Oh!

646
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,550
Look!

647
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,130
We got a swamp biome!

648
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,690
Nice!

649
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,630
When did I get that?

650
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,130
Who knows?

651
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,470
Um...

652
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,430
Let's make a...

653
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,550
Oh!

654
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,730
Let's make...

655
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,870
Let's get some more dirt...

656
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,930
Let's make a...

657
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,770
Shovel...

658
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,650
I'm just gonna take apart this whole place...

659
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,650
Some upgrades do actually screw you over...

660
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,750
I got one last time...

661
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,270
Who did that to me?

662
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,710
Hehehe...

663
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,990
My biggest breakthrough...

664
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,670
That got me to finish this...

665
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,610
The game was...

666
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,390
Observations in the chapel room...

667
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,590
Oh!

668
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,450
My observations!

669
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,570
That turned out to be an end game clue!

670
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,710
Here's $10 for helping me finish the game!

671
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,350
I...

672
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,230
Oops, sorry my bun...

673
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,790
I have astute observations!

674
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,330
No!

675
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,150
Wow!

676
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,090
Thank you!

677
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,790
David Hayter's gotta make a cameo!

678
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,750
I would want him to write the...

679
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,970
Screenplay maybe?

680
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,030
He's really good at that...

681
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,090
David Hayter is really good at like...

682
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,430
Writing...

683
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,330
Ah!

684
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,070
Hot dog indeed!

685
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,000
I think I get a lot of points if I...

686
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,020
Get dirt...

687
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,660
That's why I'm collecting dirt...

688
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,740
And...

689
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,940
I think I'm done!

690
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,240
Oh!

691
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,000
There's dirt down there!

692
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,680
And mushroom!

693
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,600
And more dirt!

694
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,720
I think I just drop dirt...

695
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,320
Like I'm...

696
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,960
Stinky...

697
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,940
Nasty...

698
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,260
Is this modded?

699
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,540
No!

700
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,820
This is...

701
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,260
Uh...

702
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,620
April Fools...

703
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,040
That...

704
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,660
Um...

705
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,320
An official April Fools...

706
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,160
Version of the game...

707
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,380
I suppose you would call it...

708
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,460
Haha...

709
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,540
I hope I like...

710
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,680
Kind of expand on it though...

711
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,280
It's kind of awesome...

712
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,140
How much are the...

713
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,080
Mushrooms worth anyway?

714
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,400
69!

715
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,250
Yeah...

716
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,590
I hope you guys are doing...

717
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,150
Well...

718
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,390
Today...

719
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,370
I hope you guys are doing well...

720
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:01,570
Today...

721
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:04,690
Um...

722
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,070
It's...

723
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,870
I had a really busy day yesterday...

724
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,550
Real real busy...

725
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,630
I've been real busy you guys...

726
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,210
I've been...

727
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:12,970
I've been...

728
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,570
I've been cooking...

729
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,490
Did you get a lot of work done?

730
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,650
Yeah...

731
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,050
What the hell?

732
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,190
Oh there he is!

733
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,290
Hello!

734
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,570
Uh...

735
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,790
I did get a lot of work done...

736
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,710
This today...

737
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,330
Actually there's more...

738
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,290
That I gotta get done today...

739
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,130
As well...

740
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,290
But uh...

741
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,630
Oop!

742
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,610
That just...

743
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:37,950
See?

744
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,290
I'm just throwing dirt...

745
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,650
Still no...

746
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,290
Special mushroom it seems...

747
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,330
Disappointing...

748
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,450
Disappointing...

749
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,830
I don't even know if this is how I'm supposed to get a special mushroom...

750
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,650
Unless I...

751
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,650
Maybe I have to like...

752
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,070
Pick up an actual mushroom...

753
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,810
For anyone...

754
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,390
Wondering...

755
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,650
There's like a...

756
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,710
Some...

757
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,650
Some sort of achievement...

758
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,570
With the mushrooms...

759
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,850
Where you can unlock more world...

760
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,130
Different...

761
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,710
Types of worlds...

762
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,250
Um...

763
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,710
But uh...

764
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,770
I guess I can just say...

765
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,150
Cause it won't be for a long time...

766
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:17,650
But um...

767
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,450
Uh...

768
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,750
So...

769
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,690
And it's...

770
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,050
Whatever...

771
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:25,930
You guys will forget...

772
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,470
Probably...

773
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,130
Eventually...

774
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,770
So basically...

775
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,790
I am...

776
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,790
Working on...

777
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,350
Well...

778
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,590
I got a new...

779
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,850
3D model...

780
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,730
And...

781
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,450
I'm working on...

782
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,770
Having a...

783
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,370
3D model...

784
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,030
Concert...

785
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,430
Debut!

786
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,810
To...

787
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,430
Which is so exciting...

788
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,010
Um...

789
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,630
It won't have a lot of guests...

790
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,550
But a few...

791
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,610
And...

792
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,490
Um...

793
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,550
I...

794
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,430
Actually...

795
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,510
Have...

796
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,110
Like...

797
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,870
Someone helped me...

798
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,910
Get...

799
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,790
Like...

800
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,850
A really...

801
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,430
Really cool...

802
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,890
Um...

803
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,570
Like...

804
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,230
3D studio...

805
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,530
Like...

806
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,470
It's...

807
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,430
I...

808
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,190
I don't know if they've ever worked with VTubers before...

809
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,030
But I'm super duper excited to work with them...

810
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,150
And...

811
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,590
Um...

812
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,850
That's kinda what...

813
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,270
A lot of like...

814
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,550
The...

815
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:25,970
What's it called?

816
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,710
The budget is going to...

817
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,550
Yay!

818
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,050
We got swamp biome!

819
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,550
So...

820
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,730
I...

821
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,250
Like I said...

822
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,210
It won't be for...

823
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,050
Quite a while from now...

824
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,190
Um...

825
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,590
But that's also why I'm going to Japan...

826
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,290
Uh...

827
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,710
Next month...

828
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,390
So...

829
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,330
Part of the reason...

830
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,910
Part of the reason...

831
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,150
And...

832
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,210
Um...

833
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,810
Proud of you, dummy...

834
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,430
Yeah, that's true...

835
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,290
You guys don't forget...

836
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,450
I'll mention something...

837
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,030
And then you'll like...

838
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,670
Ask about it...

839
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,590
Months later...

840
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,390
Was this the six times your expected budget thing?

841
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:12,690
Yes...

842
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,310
But...

843
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,830
It's because I really wanted it to look...

844
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,170
Like...

845
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,930
So professional...

846
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,510
Like I...

847
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,590
Have very high standards...

848
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,590
And so I was like...

849
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,870
I...

850
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,710
And I know...

851
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,310
I...

852
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:27,770
Oh my gosh...

853
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,810
I can't wait till...

854
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,150
When I can tell you guys...

855
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,410
Because then you'll be like...

856
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,370
You'll be like...

857
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,350
Holy moly!

858
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,430
Like...

859
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,790
That's why it looked so good!

860
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,810
So I'm gonna...

861
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,030
Obviously I can't tell you now...

862
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,310
But...

863
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,050
Hmm...

864
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,310
Hmm...

865
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,210
Hmm...

866
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,270
You'll be like...

867
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,970
That's why it looked so good!

868
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,090
Wowee!

869
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,870
So...

870
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,150
It's...

871
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:50,570
It's...

872
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,210
It's...

873
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:51,590
You know...

874
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,890
Gonna be all really...

875
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,130
Really...

876
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,670
Professionally done...

877
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,390
Hehehe...

878
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,310
And so I was...

879
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,830
I'm excited about it...

880
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,950
And I'm nervous about it...

881
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,250
I'm nervous if like...

882
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,590
The payoff will be...

883
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,510
Worth the amount...

884
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,250
I suppose...

885
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,330
But it's also...

886
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,710
Not always like a...

887
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,730
Not always like a...

888
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:12,930
Uh...

889
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,290
Uh...

890
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,050
Like I'm not gonna make my money back...

891
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,930
I know that for sure...

892
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,370
But...

893
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:16,890
It's not...

894
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,770
It's not about that...

895
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,010
It's also like...

896
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:19,910
Just for me too...

897
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,170
You know...

898
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,530
Like I wanna be able to...

899
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,530
I went with the more expensive option...

900
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,630
Because I was like...

901
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,570
I wanted to look good for you guys...

902
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,630
And I wanted to look good for me as well...

903
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,430
So...

904
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,150
And it will be free...

905
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,090
On my channel...

906
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,570
So...

907
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,170
Yeah...

908
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,950
So you don't have to worry...

909
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,890
Swamp I am!

910
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,410
Let's go!

911
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,330
Wait...

912
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,410
I see swamp is kinda strange...

913
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,490
No?

914
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,090
Let's get...

915
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:46,570
Wait...

916
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,210
So I think slimes are already in there...

917
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,070
Um...

918
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,290
Skellies...

919
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,730
Spiders...

920
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,010
What else do we want in here?

921
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,350
Um...

922
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,430
Amplified world...

923
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,090
Floating island...

924
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,890
Dark forest...

925
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:05,990
Jungle...

926
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,090
Mud has more value than dirt...

927
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,550
It does!

928
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,190
Cows for food...

929
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,710
So true...

930
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,910
Let's get some food in there...

931
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,170
Yeah...

932
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,630
You're so right...

933
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:16,810
Um...

934
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,770
And we got slimes...

935
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,050
We have no other like...

936
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,790
Hostile mobs...

937
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,930
Which is kinda nice...

938
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,570
The fact that you're doing it at all is...

939
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,630
Awesome and worth celebrating...

940
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:26,830
Thank you!

941
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,630
Pre-order from my concert ticket...

942
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,490
Let's do...

943
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,600
Let's do...

944
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,420
I kinda like to make this...

945
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,160
Oh actually...

946
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,800
Let's do Acacia...

947
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,760
Because like...

948
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:44,980
Savannah...

949
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,660
Because it's like...

950
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,160
Weird...

951
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,780
I wanna like a weird combination...

952
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,920
Something you don't usually get...

953
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,040
You know?

954
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,920
That's what's really fun about this...

955
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,680
Game mode...

956
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,000
When is the concert?

957
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,320
I can't say...

958
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,500
But it won't be for several months...

959
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:01,980
Yeah...

960
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,720
Yeah...

961
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,380
Ducky...

962
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,560
Thank you so much for the fun...

963
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,380
Thank you!

964
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,880
Oh my gosh...

965
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,740
It's so...

966
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,600
I forgot we're in the slippery...

967
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,100
Wait...

968
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
I did...

969
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,080
I did...

970
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,540
Why do we have dark wood too?

971
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,060
Why is it...

972
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,720
Always raining?

973
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,940
One ticket please!

974
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,560
Thank you!

975
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,920
Oh I also got an upgrade...

976
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,580
What are we at now?

977
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,660
30!

978
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,820
Thank you Cryos...

979
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,420
Thank you!

980
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,940
I don't want you guys to feel like...

981
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,860
You have to...

982
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,940
Donate or anything though...

983
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,100
I...

984
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,420
But of course...

985
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,520
It's also not the only thing...

986
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,380
I'm working on...

987
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,300
But...

988
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,720
I figured...

989
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,060
You know...

990
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,100
Um...

991
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,300
I actually...

992
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,940
Have a meeting about it tonight...

993
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,220
So I'm excited...

994
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,520
I'm meeting with like the...

995
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,940
I'm meeting the 3D team...

996
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,600
And talking with them about...

997
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,640
Everything that we can do!

998
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,800
Hehehe...

999
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,460
So...

1000
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,100
And I got some other...

1001
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,760
Really exciting news last night!

1002
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,980
You guys...

1003
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,840
Exciting things are happening...

1004
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,860
Which is exciting!

1005
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,020
Ticket and merch bundle!

1006
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,560
Wait...

1007
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,100
That's not how you get the merch though!

1008
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,980
Stop!

1009
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,660
Look at there's lots of mushrooms here...

1010
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,760
Um...

1011
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,900
Is there any food around?

1012
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,040
Hehehe...

1013
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,760
Any food...

1014
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,920
For me...

1015
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,760
To eat?

1016
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,840
Where's my cows?

1017
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,240
Hehehe...

1018
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,660
Where are my cows at?

1019
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,870
Everything's coming up Minto...

1020
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,130
I'm trying!

1021
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,930
I'm trying!

1022
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,550
Hehehe...

1023
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,450
I want you guys to be like...

1024
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,870
Yeah...

1025
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,670
Being mint fan is...

1026
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,150
Really awesome!

1027
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:06,990
Hehehe...

1028
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,450
Wasn't there one that we...

1029
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,970
Start with like a...

1030
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,750
Pickaxe, no?

1031
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,230
Maybe it's...

1032
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,470
Which one?

1033
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,650
Oh, this one maybe...

1034
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,750
Starting pickaxe!

1035
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1036
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,350
Okay...

1037
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,310
Dig...

1038
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,250
Oh!

1039
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,350
I think I can get this!

1040
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,230
Yeah...

1041
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,460
Yeah...

1042
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:27,670
Wow...

1043
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,910
Diamond even...

1044
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,690
Okay...

1045
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,050
Oh!

1046
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,450
Wow, they already gave it to me!

1047
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,970
This is what I was trying to get!

1048
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,310
Oh my gosh, no way!

1049
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,230
This...

1050
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,910
We got the mushrooms!

1051
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,850
Oh, it has been...

1052
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,490
Yippee!

1053
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:46,630
Yippee!

1054
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,010
Haha!

1055
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,930
Triple the defense and dance budget!

1056
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:54,510
Hehehe!

1057
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,150
I've been like...

1058
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,650
Creating my set lists...

1059
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,310
And...

1060
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,290
Making...

1061
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,390
I think it's pretty cool!

1062
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,170
Yuck!

1063
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,770
I think it's pretty good so far!

1064
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,890
So...

1065
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,290
In my opinion...

1066
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,270
I don't know...

1067
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:24,350
I don't know...

1068
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,810
I'm extremely proud of the...

1069
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:26,930
Vehicle!

1070
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,890
Thank you!

1071
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,270
Thank you guys!

1072
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:36,990
But yeah!

1073
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,510
That's what I was working on yesterday!

1074
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,250
And...

1075
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,550
Other stuff...

1076
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,250
Oh my gosh!

1077
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,650
Whoa, we're so fast!

1078
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,310
Whoa!

1079
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,170
Ouch!

1080
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,650
Where are my cows?

1081
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,030
Oh, there they are.

1082
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:07,690
Oh, he's probably a dummy.

1083
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,190
Well, I don't know.

1084
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,670
I want you to be like, wow.

1085
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,570
She's doing things.

1086
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,290
I don't know.

1087
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,130
Okay.

1088
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:15,730
I don't know.

1089
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,670
Wait, I need a stick.

1090
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,400
Actually, we'll do an axe.

1091
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,140
Come here, food.

1092
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,180
Nice.

1093
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,240
Come here, food.

1094
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,620
Thank you.

1095
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,620
What's that over there?

1096
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,840
Is that a goat?

1097
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,100
That's a goat.

1098
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:41,420
Okay.

1099
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,670
Um, how much did he give me?

1100
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,750
Nine pieces from two cows!

1101
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,110
Chunky fellas.

1102
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,810
Wow, real hefty.

1103
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,690
I want to stay in this biome because it's not raining here.

1104
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,970
Why is it getting so dark?

1105
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,850
Wait, is it getting... Is it...

1106
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,410
What are you guys?

1107
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,110
The crackling.

1108
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,830
No way!

1109
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:17,650
That's the... The pale oak... Wait.

1110
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:18,690
Oh my gosh.

1111
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,990
There's a thing right there.

1112
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,830
The exit's right there, but the... The creaking!

1113
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,190
They're not the... What did I say?

1114
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,350
More cow.

1115
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,770
Hold on.

1116
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,330
We're going to cook our meat in a second.

1117
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:31,410
Yeah.

1118
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:31,670
Oops.

1119
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,230
Please.

1120
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,630
Hold on.

1121
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,410
Holy cow.

1122
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,450
What did I get?

1123
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,370
Gave me so much stuff.

1124
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,390
And we... Oh my gosh!

1125
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:45,910
Wait.

1126
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,250
We got the mushrooms and the mushroom field biome.

1127
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,310
That's exactly the two things I was trying to get before.

1128
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,450
Food.

1129
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:54,510
Wow.

1130
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,610
They give you so much food.

1131
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,790
Oh.

1132
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,550
Oops.

1133
00:40:59,690 --> 00:40:59,770
Sorry.

1134
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,410
Excuse me.

1135
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:01,850
Thank you.

1136
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,350
Thank you.

1137
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,310
Big beef.

1138
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,590
Yeah.

1139
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,050
Holy food!

1140
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,890
Wow.

1141
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,110
Why do they give so much?

1142
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,570
They're generous.

1143
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,470
I gotta go get some...

1144
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,110
Stone over here.

1145
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,430
So we can make a...

1146
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,370
Uh...

1147
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,210
Furnish?

1148
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,110
Hopefully there's some more...

1149
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,210
Doesn't seem to be any more coal.

1150
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,070
That's so sad.

1151
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,110
This is such a bizarre...

1152
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,230
Biome makeup.

1153
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,410
Wondering what's your most anticipated figure.

1154
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,410
Mine's Chobits...

1155
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,250
Oh!

1156
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,870
I...

1157
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,030
Wait.

1158
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,270
The Chobits one that's like her on the...

1159
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,050
The telephone pole, right?

1160
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,290
I did see that.

1161
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,030
I did see that one.

1162
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,290
My most anticipated.

1163
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,590
My most anticipated.

1164
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,770
Every moment with Minto makes me feel that I'm in mint condition.

1165
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,350
And you've made our world much brighter.

1166
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,090
I'm proud to be your fan.

1167
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:13,850
Tome.

1168
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,630
Thanks, Syntax.

1169
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,890
I don't know.

1170
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:18,350
I have...

1171
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,250
I would have to see...

1172
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,470
I would have to see what...

1173
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,150
Figures I have pre-ordered right now.

1174
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,410
Because I recently...

1175
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,050
I recently...

1176
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,790
Had one that I really wanted.

1177
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,270
It was a YouTube camp one.

1178
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,430
But it was so expensive.

1179
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,650
And...

1180
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,370
I was like...

1181
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,470
In...

1182
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:41,810
Holy moly.

1183
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,430
I was like in an effort to save money.

1184
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:44,910
I...

1185
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,590
I...

1186
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,890
I let it...

1187
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,590
I let it just roll over.

1188
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,950
I didn't...

1189
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,890
I didn't get it.

1190
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,950
So I was like...

1191
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:53,450
I...

1192
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,110
I...

1193
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,870
I need to save money.

1194
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,670
So...

1195
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:03,970
Oh...

1196
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:04,630
Oh, that scared me.

1197
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,390
Okay.

1198
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,230
Oh, I wanted to see if we could get some like new...

1199
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,110
Something here.

1200
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,090
You know.

1201
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,490
Maybe not.

1202
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,630
I have...

1203
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,350
I honestly don't have much room left in my...

1204
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,610
In my figure shelf anyway.

1205
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:27,850
So...

1206
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,830
What I've been doing actually...

1207
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,630
Is I've been...

1208
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,430
Taking an extra suitcase...

1209
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,310
With me to Japan.

1210
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,110
And filling it up with figures.

1211
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,990
And then selling them at Mandarake.

1212
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,790
I've been selling them.

1213
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,010
I've been...

1214
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,590
I've been selling them and...

1215
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,110
Oh, nice.

1216
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:55,990
Oh, like...

1217
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,490
Figures and other like...

1218
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,430
Weeb merch that I don't really...

1219
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,170
You know.

1220
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,310
So I...

1221
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:09,710
Well...

1222
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,790
And I don't...

1223
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,090
You know, honestly...

1224
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,290
Like I don't make a ton of money back from it.

1225
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:14,950
Because, you know...

1226
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:15,490
Figures...

1227
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,330
The original figures were so expensive, obviously.

1228
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:18,390
But...

1229
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,110
It's not like a...

1230
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:20,790
You know...

1231
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:21,330
It's...

1232
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,870
It's good like spending money.

1233
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:24,290
You know?

1234
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,930
It's actually...

1235
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,500
Good like a little bit of a...

1236
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,050
Like, yeah.

1237
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:31,410
I...

1238
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,400
I get a little bit of...

1239
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:33,890
Like...

1240
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:34,270
I can...

1241
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:34,890
I'll be like...

1242
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,210
Oh, I'll go buy like a new outfit with this.

1243
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:37,490
You know?

1244
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,110
What kind of deal?

1245
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,150
Hey, party people!

1246
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,260
And I'm cleaning up.

1247
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,920
And I also feel much better.

1248
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,000
Because it's like I'm...

1249
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,360
I'm cleaning my...

1250
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,440
My place.

1251
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,780
And also...

1252
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,720
Not like...

1253
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,040
Like...

1254
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,380
What else?

1255
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,400
There's a bunch of stuff that I'm like...

1256
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:03,520
You know?

1257
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,460
Maybe someone...

1258
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,580
Will see it.

1259
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,520
And be like...

1260
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:06,940
Oh my gosh!

1261
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,640
I've been looking for this figure forever!

1262
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,620
But...

1263
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,080
Maybe like an average person...

1264
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,180
Would not...

1265
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,600
Care.

1266
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,300
You know what I mean?

1267
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,180
Like...

1268
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,540
It might be like a little bit more niche of a figure...

1269
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,280
Or something like that.

1270
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,580
I don't know...

1271
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,180
What mobs are gonna spawn tonight.

1272
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:22,960
So I'm kinda scared.

1273
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:23,600
Haha.

1274
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,960
But we have that guy up there.

1275
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,620
We gotta go too.

1276
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,750
I almost missed it!

1277
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:41,590
Blackstone bio!

1278
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,170
Nice!

1279
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,570
I almost missed it.

1280
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,110
Nice.

1281
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,330
Thanks for the fun streaming though.

1282
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:47,090
It's my birthday!

1283
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:47,630
Neptune!

1284
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:48,370
Happy birthday!

1285
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:49,470
I'm hungover.

1286
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:50,010
Haha.

1287
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,290
Sounds like you already had a good...

1288
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:52,930
Happy birthday.

1289
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,590
Happy birthday to you...

1290
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,530
Happy birthday to you...

1291
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:04,390
Happy birthday dear Neptune...

1292
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,690
Happy birthday to you...

1293
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:08,870
Woo!

1294
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,210
Happy birthday!

1295
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,130
Okay, maybe nothing is gonna spawn.

1296
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,230
Oh, I'm literally... Ouch!

1297
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,190
I'm throwing rocks, I'm throwing rocks.

1298
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,970
I mean, dirt, not rocks.

1299
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:22,470
My bad.

1300
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,250
Do you think we can go up in there, you guys?

1301
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,730
All I see are goats.

1302
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,550
All I see are goats.

1303
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:41,250
No creepers, no skellies, no spiders, no... Wait, didn't this have slimes, no?

1304
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,170
I know it had slimes.

1305
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,810
Okay, let's make... I wish I could find iron.

1306
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:53,350
Because I want to make a sword, but we got a pickaxe, at least.

1307
00:46:59,010 --> 00:46:59,810
Chicken jockey.

1308
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,970
I wonder how we can get chicken jockey.

1309
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,610
Gonna get a happy birthday for my 30th.

1310
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,450
Argentine, happy birthday!

1311
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,930
Happy birthday to you.

1312
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,930
Happy birthday to you.

1313
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,310
Happy birthday, dear Argentine.

1314
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,030
I hope I'm saying your name right.

1315
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:25,070
Happy birthday to you.

1316
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,830
Happy birthday.

1317
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:29,090
Happy birthday.

1318
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,130
All right, let's create.

1319
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:32,830
You know what?

1320
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,430
If I die... Wait, no, I don't want to die.

1321
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,550
Because I got the mooshrooms.

1322
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,910
I got...

1323
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,850
The exit's right there!

1324
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,990
We would just... leave, right?

1325
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,030
I'm scared though.

1326
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,190
Creaking is scary.

1327
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,950
The creaking is so freaky.

1328
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,450
Let's see.

1329
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,730
What's a good way to get up there?

1330
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,930
It's also weird walking around at night and...

1331
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,190
Not feeling like... have to look over your shoulder.

1332
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,950
I guess if we go up here, we will though.

1333
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,420
I'm being brave.

1334
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,180
Is that a skelly?

1335
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,980
No, that's a go.

1336
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,300
Almost had me there.

1337
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,900
Almost had me there.

1338
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,200
Oh no!

1339
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,340
It's on fire!

1340
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,220
Wait!

1341
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,600
Wow, look at all the flowers.

1342
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,080
Are they gonna burn?

1343
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,640
Nice.

1344
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,660
Any... any creaking?

1345
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,940
Oh, holy moly.

1346
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,850
Any creaking?

1347
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,510
Start cutting some pale wood.

1348
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:09,110
Maybe we'll get a pale wood biome.

1349
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,850
That would be so scary though.

1350
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,850
That would be the freakiest... biome to get.

1351
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,800
A whole thing of... pale wood biome.

1352
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,510
I might cry.

1353
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:23,790
Creaking creaks!

1354
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:23,830
Creaking creaks!

1355
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:27,730
Where is he?

1356
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:36,610
Where is he though?

1357
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,830
I think he might be able to one hit me, no?

1358
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,240
You saw it?

1359
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,080
No you didn't.

1360
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:58,990
Oh, dang it.

1361
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:00,250
Um...

1362
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,470
And I didn't bring another axe.

1363
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,110
But, we have wood.

1364
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,610
I can make another crafting table.

1365
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,190
That's how you play the game.

1366
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,290
You make crafting tables and...

1367
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,190
You... you know...

1368
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,050
That's how you play the game.

1369
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,230
Um...

1370
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,630
I'm scared of him!

1371
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,150
I'm scared of him!

1372
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:19,230
I'm scared...

1373
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,550
Oh, I got a sapling.

1374
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,990
Uh...

1375
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,730
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

1376
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:26,830
Creaking creaks!

1377
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:27,570
Where?

1378
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,230
Where are you mister?

1379
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:32,990
Where are you?

1380
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,450
He's creaking?

1381
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,530
He's doing his thing.

1382
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,400
Can you hear it?

1383
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,100
I'm too much of a baby.

1384
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:45,880
I'm not gonna lie.

1385
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,620
I'm too much of a baby to go in there.

1386
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,860
I'm so scared!

1387
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,200
The guy has so much HP too!

1388
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,200
He sounds so close!

1389
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,630
I don't think he's behind me.

1390
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,750
I actually have no idea.

1391
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,970
He definitely sounds in front of me.

1392
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,770
The forest is on fire.

1393
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,810
How about yours?

1394
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,450
That's the way I like it.

1395
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,530
I'm never gonna burn.

1396
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,110
Hey now, you're a rockstar!

1397
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,510
Get to get in my...

1398
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,550
Go play!

1399
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,530
Hey now, you're an all-star!

1400
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,270
Let me get paid!

1401
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,230
All the glitters and gold!

1402
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,470
All the shooting stars!

1403
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,970
Break the mold!

1404
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,130
Any of them?

1405
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,190
None of them?

1406
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:45,050
Oh, gosh.

1407
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:45,590
It scared me.

1408
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,310
None of them seem like...

1409
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:50,210
Seeds...

1410
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,350
For new worlds, unfortunately.

1411
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,490
I could keep going inside, but I hear him!

1412
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,110
You guys, I hear him!

1413
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:04,750
Sorry!

1414
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,870
He's really freaking me out!

1415
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,230
He sounds so stinking close!

1416
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,450
I

1417
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,050
actually don't know where he is.

1418
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,610
He might be below, actually.

1419
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:27,830
I wonder...

1420
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,710
If he's below...

1421
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,640
I think he's watching me.

1422
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,030
If I go back to camp, will he follow?

1423
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:01,430
You know?

1424
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,250
If I go back...

1425
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,250
Will he follow me?

1426
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,610
I said look by...

1427
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:14,830
Oh!

1428
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:15,410
It's almost daytime!

1429
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,810
He's gonna die soon!

1430
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:34,140
For everybody telling me to trap him and put a name tag on him, I don't think you understand what we're playing.

1431
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,240
Do you want him to follow you, though?

1432
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,560
No.

1433
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,180
Oh!

1434
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,660
Oh, I'm so strong!

1435
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,360
I'm the strong...

1436
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,540
Wow!

1437
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,800
I'm the strongest!

1438
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,500
To ever do it!

1439
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:12,700
Yeah!

1440
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,140
I wonder how much you get for these.

1441
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:18,860
How much experience?

1442
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,560
0.6.

1443
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,920
Well, that was her first...

1444
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,740
One punch made!

1445
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,580
Aw, dang it.

1446
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,770
I'm trying to see if we can get...

1447
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,170
Actually, would I even want a biome, though?

1448
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,090
Of all...

1449
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,750
Would I even want this biome?

1450
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,750
Like, yes and no.

1451
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,430
You know?

1452
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:51,910
Yes and no.

1453
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,390
Maybe I'm like, he's behind...

1454
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,490
Or he's below me.

1455
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:57,450
I'm totally safe.

1456
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,380
This is a big biome, though.

1457
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,000
It's a big area.

1458
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:08,440
Ouch!

1459
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:14,270
I'm strong.

1460
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:16,830
I'm not strong.

1461
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,330
I'm not strong at all.

1462
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,650
Oh, let's put...

1463
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:22,330
Turn these into sticks.

1464
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,950
It's my birthday child!

1465
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,710
Happy birthday!

1466
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,050
I'm really happy I get to watch your stream while I'm working.

1467
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,570
Can I be greedy and ask for a mother-based birthday song?

1468
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:31,310
Of course!

1469
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,230
It's my favorite.

1470
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,990
Happy birthday!

1471
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,190
Congratulations!

1472
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,030
Happy birthday!

1473
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,130
With salutations!

1474
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:42,590
Happy birthday!

1475
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,690
May your sky stay blue!

1476
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:50,070
Happy birthday to you!

1477
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:50,710
Woo!

1478
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,390
Happy birthday joy!

1479
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,130
Look at this, too!

1480
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,090
We also get so much more...

1481
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,310
Oh, I just realized I could make a stone axe.

1482
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:00,630
Heh heh.

1483
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,270
We also get so much more, like, uh...

1484
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,030
Experience, because...

1485
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,730
Pale biome is spooky...

1486
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,710
And rare.

1487
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:10,190
So...

1488
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,610
I'm gonna keep going until we can maybe...

1489
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,670
Maybe until it's nighttime again.

1490
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,530
But I wanna try...

1491
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,270
Either nighttime, or...

1492
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,130
We get...

1493
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,710
Um...

1494
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,710
The seed...

1495
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,010
To be able to...

1496
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,010
Do our own...

1497
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,990
Pale biomes, you know?

1498
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,630
I don't know which...

1499
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,120
If it's the trees, if it's the...

1500
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:35,710
The moss...

1501
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,090
I don't know.

1502
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,190
A shiny biome, yeah.

1503
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,490
Might as well break the soil, too.

1504
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:45,910
Yeah!

1505
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:47,570
Like, I don't know...

1506
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:47,730
Ooh!

1507
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,510
Can you imagine if that was it?

1508
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:50,130
And it just...

1509
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:50,830
Drifted away?

1510
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,210
What's that?

1511
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:53,730
Oh, nothing.

1512
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,330
We will take apart this entire biome...

1513
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,790
Mold by mold!

1514
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,010
What was that?

1515
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,180
Hunter.

1516
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:20,940
Come

1517
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,120
on!

1518
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,280
Where's my seed?

1519
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,700
Even though I don't wanna come back here.

1520
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,160
Ha ha ha ha!

1521
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:32,520
Ha ha ha!

1522
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,340
So spooky.

1523
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,600
Why would they...

1524
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,160
They...

1525
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,000
Are not beating the...

1526
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,860
Minecraft as a horror game allocations.

1527
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,540
With...

1528
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,920
With creating this, you know?

1529
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,520
Oh my gosh, you guys!

1530
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,160
I really...

1531
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,800
Want to play...

1532
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,840
The new...

1533
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,040
Oblivion!

1534
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,020
Oh my god!

1535
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,760
My entire TikTok is all just oblivion clips now.

1536
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,040
Cause I keep liking every single one that I see.

1537
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,640
Oh, I wanna play it so bad.

1538
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,540
I wanted to play the original one.

1539
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,760
Um...

1540
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,340
Cause of all the funniness that I see about it.

1541
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,080
But I wonder if...

1542
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,280
But I'm also kinda like, maybe I...

1543
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,960
It would be such a long saga.

1544
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,160
I don't know...

1545
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,780
I don't know...

1546
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,740
Quite yet...

1547
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,820
How I wanna go about it.

1548
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:32,840
Hmm...

1549
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,660
Let's do oblivion!

1550
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,180
It would be really long.

1551
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,140
I have so many other games I need to play too.

1552
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:46,420
So...

1553
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,080
I wanna play...

1554
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,840
But oh my gosh...

1555
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,560
They really were just like...

1556
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,680
We're gonna keep the charm of the original.

1557
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,540
And then...

1558
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,140
Meant it.

1559
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,340
Cause I was kinda nervous.

1560
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,140
I was just like...

1561
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,580
Actually, I was like thinking about it.

1562
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:56,960
I was like...

1563
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,780
I don't know if I would wanna play the remake.

1564
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,400
I think I wanna stick with the original.

1565
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,100
Because...

1566
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,080
I think...

1567
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,300
I was like...

1568
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,200
I don't know if they're fixing the jank.

1569
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,360
And also...

1570
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,560
Like...

1571
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,440
You know, I like the jank of the...

1572
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,440
Of the old graphics as well, you know?

1573
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,500
But...

1574
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,520
But at the same time...

1575
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,520
But now I'm seeing it.

1576
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:24,900
And I'm like...

1577
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,380
Wait, it seems so...

1578
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,580
Like the original.

1579
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,800
Like they didn't change anything.

1580
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,300
It just upgraded graphics.

1581
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,200
But...

1582
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,200
I...

1583
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,810
It's impossible to fix jank.

1584
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,170
It makes me so happy.

1585
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,550
I know.

1586
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,530
And I've never played it before.

1587
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,230
So it would be a...

1588
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,930
First time ever experience.

1589
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,590
Which is always exciting for me.

1590
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:00,910
Besides like the few clips that I've seen.

1591
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,550
Of like...

1592
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:02,990
The...

1593
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:04,470
NPCs...

1594
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,010
NPC-ing.

1595
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:07,830
Oh!

1596
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,490
Another one.

1597
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:10,210
Oh!

1598
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:10,410
Oh!

1599
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,950
Wait, where'd that go?

1600
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,450
Wait, where'd my...

1601
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,250
Oh!

1602
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:17,150
It's in the trees.

1603
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,030
My resin.

1604
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,190
I wanna get it but 60 game backlog.

1605
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,370
Yeah...

1606
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:29,170
Yeah...

1607
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:33,900
But I wanna play it.

1608
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,640
I want to play.

1609
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:37,380
I want to play.

1610
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:37,940
So maybe...

1611
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,340
We'll...

1612
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,260
We'll do that.

1613
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:41,740
Sometime.

1614
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,180
I don't know.

1615
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:43,660
Who knows?

1616
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,240
Maybe I won't be able to give in.

1617
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:45,940
Or...

1618
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,960
I won't be able to resist.

1619
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,320
And I'll give in.

1620
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:48,940
And I'll...

1621
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,340
I'll play it next week.

1622
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:50,880
Who knows?

1623
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,380
I don't know.

1624
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,060
I don't know.

1625
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,060
Today is not my birthday.

1626
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,080
However, it is the 282nd un-birthday.

1627
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,760
I'll very merry and birthday to you.

1628
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:01,920
To you.

1629
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:03,940
Okay.

1630
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,360
We have so much pale wood.

1631
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,440
At least I'm gonna get experience from it.

1632
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,480
It's really good playing it right now.

1633
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,780
It feels just like the original with better graphics and a few...

1634
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,340
Oh!

1635
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,180
There are some quality of life improvements.

1636
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,480
That's always a plus too.

1637
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,920
Good to know.

1638
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:22,640
Good to know.

1639
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,720
Let's steal some of the flowers.

1640
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,180
I'm thinking maybe...

1641
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:34,860
The...

1642
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,520
Like the...

1643
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,880
The droppings from the tree is what might give us the...

1644
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,660
The seed.

1645
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,400
Hopefully.

1646
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,540
Either that, maybe the flowers.

1647
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,100
I don't know.

1648
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,940
They fixed the screwy leveling system.

1649
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,020
Oh, I didn't even see...

1650
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:48,260
I don't even...

1651
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,360
Like I said, I've never played it.

1652
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,220
I didn't even know that was an issue.

1653
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,900
So maybe then it would be better to play though.

1654
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,000
What is it?

1655
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,560
A remaster?

1656
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,210
I'm scared.

1657
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,750
The creaking is going to come out any second.

1658
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,450
Wait, I kind of killed him though, didn't I?

1659
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:14,230
Actually.

1660
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,050
Now that I think about it.

1661
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,030
I broke his little heart.

1662
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:19,890
I broke his little heart.

1663
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,610
But there might be more.

1664
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,010
So yeah.

1665
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:32,850
Oblivion's been on my mind.

1666
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,250
Like all today.

1667
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,950
All this morning.

1668
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,630
I was just...

1669
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,830
I was just watching TikToks and laughing to them.

1670
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,250
I'm just like...

1671
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,950
Look at that NPC.

1672
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,490
Being dumb.

1673
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:53,560
Yeah.

1674
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,860
It's a good thing though that I took yesterday off.

1675
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,900
Cause I was not feeling well at all.

1676
01:02:59,260 --> 01:02:59,620
Oh my gosh.

1677
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,840
I was feeling so, so bad.

1678
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,420
So...

1679
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,220
Honestly...

1680
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,200
It's good.

1681
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,560
That I took it off.

1682
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:08,900
But...

1683
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,580
Today I'm feeling a little okay.

1684
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,900
I might actually start doing two days off a week.

1685
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,880
For the unforeseeable future.

1686
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:21,880
Because...

1687
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,580
I told you guys...

1688
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,120
This is also why I wanted to tell you about the concert.

1689
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,680
Because you guys know that I've been having issues with like my voice and everything.

1690
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,560
And I'm like...

1691
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,660
I need to sound good for a concert.

1692
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,700
I need to sound good for a concert.

1693
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:38,660
So...

1694
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,300
Might be having more...

1695
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,060
Days off.

1696
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,260
Just for that.

1697
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,300
That's why I was like...

1698
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,300
I don't want you guys to think that I'm getting lazy.

1699
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,700
Because honestly, I was like...

1700
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,320
Yesterday I was like...

1701
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:54,880
What if I stream?

1702
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,660
What if I just...

1703
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,340
I don't know.

1704
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,100
I guess...

1705
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,540
Even though I was working the whole day.

1706
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,640
It's not that...

1707
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,720
Sometimes I...

1708
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,640
When I take a day off.

1709
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,220
Sometimes I don't work.

1710
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,380
And I get bored.

1711
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:05,880
And I'm like...

1712
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,800
What if I just stream?

1713
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,480
Because I'm bored.

1714
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,940
But yesterday I was working.

1715
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,500
Pretty much that whole day.

1716
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,660
And even still I was just like...

1717
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,320
I want to stream.

1718
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,840
It's called a weekend, Minto.

1719
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:20,740
Then I'll be like...

1720
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:21,720
Oh...

1721
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:22,860
I'm leaving.

1722
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,320
I'm leaving.

1723
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:23,820
I'm leaving.

1724
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,340
I'm leaving.

1725
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:24,820
I'm leaving.

1726
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:25,360
I'm leaving.

1727
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,280
I'm leaving.

1728
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:31,010
To me...

1729
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:31,650
I...

1730
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,470
Never think of it like that.

1731
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,070
Because I just feel...

1732
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,570
I feel like...

1733
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,810
What I get to do is so easy and so fun.

1734
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,750
That it's not like anything...

1735
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,590
For me to...

1736
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,310
Just...

1737
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,490
Do it all the time.

1738
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:51,790
Why no rest?

1739
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:52,250
Wait to bye.

1740
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:52,490
Why?

1741
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,290
I don't know.

1742
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,250
I don't know.

1743
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:11,530
Okay.

1744
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:12,830
We can leave now.

1745
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,330
I think I got enough stuff.

1746
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,370
Not even the resin.

1747
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:17,710
I guess it's...

1748
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,870
Because a full stack of wood is 1.28.

1749
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:20,590
And then...

1750
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,510
Minto streams everyday.

1751
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:29,550
Sometimes twice a day.

1752
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:31,050
Minto, am I lazy?

1753
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,750
I don't want you to think I'm...

1754
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:34,510
Sorry.

1755
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,590
I don't want you to think I'm lazy.

1756
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:42,830
That's what I'm trying to say.

1757
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,910
Sorry.

1758
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:03,190
I don't want you to think I'm lazy.

1759
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:04,910
That's what I'm trying to say.

1760
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:05,110
Wow.

1761
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,750
We got the Moonshrooms.

1762
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,330
Oh, nice.

1763
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:15,630
Forty-five.

1764
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,650
We're killin' it.

1765
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:25,690
Give it to buy.

1766
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:26,310
Never think.

1767
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:28,770
Valid.

1768
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:31,450
Moonshrooms.

1769
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,070
And, oh, Axolotl.

1770
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,470
Wait, I want to go to the...

1771
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:36,090
Arigato, arigato.

1772
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,510
How do I go to the Moonshroom world?

1773
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:41,830
I'll see if we have spiders here.

1774
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,070
Oh!

1775
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,570
I messed up.

1776
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:47,350
No!

1777
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,950
I messed up.

1778
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,790
Even Minecraft says to do what your rest is.

1779
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,810
Why is it always raining?

1780
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:21,150
This is calming to you.

1781
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:22,770
Calming where?

1782
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,390
Oh, look.

1783
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,630
We got a diorite base.

1784
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,260
Okay.

1785
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:36,700
Alright.

1786
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,800
Let's go... Oh, I thought that was lava for a second.

1787
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,380
Let's go find...

1788
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,200
Um, our exit.

1789
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,760
Especially because this is not what I wanted to create.

1790
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,140
Eh.

1791
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:55,910
Will the spiders get me?

1792
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,470
It's not nighttime, but it's dark.

1793
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:03,510
Mate, you scared me.

1794
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:04,490
I'm sorry!

1795
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,930
Look how many spiders there are, actually.

1796
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,610
At the first fanart, I post and your tag is cursed.

1797
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:15,530
But the brain worms made me do it.

1798
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,010
What are you talking about?

1799
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,030
Are the spiders gonna get me?

1800
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:30,690
I can't tell.

1801
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,050
Friend or foe.

1802
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,430
There's so many of them.

1803
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:37,670
Friend or foe.

1804
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,330
I retweeted it.

1805
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,290
Wait, which one was it?

1806
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:51,070
Oh!

1807
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,030
Yeah, I remember seeing that.

1808
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:54,730
Yeah.

1809
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,830
I remember seeing that.

1810
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:58,510
Yes, I do.

1811
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,470
I don't know.

1812
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:01,830
I don't know.

1813
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:02,950
What is wrong with that game, though?

1814
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:03,930
Like, what's...

1815
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,450
What's the issue with it?

1816
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,650
I don't know anything about it.

1817
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,300
Cannibalism!

1818
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:29,670
Don't find me wasting this furry milestone chat.

1819
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:33,910
Oh...

1820
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:35,550
So it's, like, pretty freaky.

1821
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:41,390
Interesting.

1822
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,330
She didn't know.

1823
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,070
I didn't know!

1824
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:46,390
Yeah, I didn't know.

1825
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:47,730
Interesting.

1826
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,150
Is it, like...

1827
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:52,890
But I see so many people playing it.

1828
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,210
Is it because it's, like, really...

1829
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,310
Like, a good story?

1830
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,970
Or is it just because it's freaky?

1831
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,650
Like, is it, like, the shock factor, you know?

1832
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,510
Sounds right up your alley.

1833
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:05,590
Oh, yeah.

1834
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:07,310
Absolutely.

1835
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,170
Okay, at least we got a food source here.

1836
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:13,250
No!

1837
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,370
You're a foe!

1838
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:15,010
You're foe!

1839
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:15,650
You're foe!

1840
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,590
You're foe!

1841
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:16,830
You're foe!

1842
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,170
You're foe!

1843
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:23,510
Dang it.

1844
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:24,990
They're foe in the rain.

1845
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:25,370
Okay.

1846
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,370
Good to know.

1847
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:29,030
Oh!

1848
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:38,770
Whoa!

1849
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:40,610
I'm crazy.

1850
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,350
Crazy crap!

1851
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,070
Uh-oh.

1852
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,530
I think I can mine this without...

1853
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,060
It's a good game.

1854
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:57,900
Is it?

1855
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,220
Don't die with your levels.

1856
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,020
Oh, you're so right.

1857
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,180
Let's, uh...

1858
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,540
Okay.

1859
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:06,440
Hold on.

1860
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,440
Let's upgrade.

1861
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,200
What the?

1862
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,400
I got foxes!

1863
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,100
Let's...

1864
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,180
Let's get our level.

1865
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,480
Let's get, um...

1866
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,300
Ah!

1867
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,260
Maybe this.

1868
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,560
Shield bash.

1869
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,200
And then also maybe the sword.

1870
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,000
I can at least get this one, alright?

1871
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,740
Safety hole.

1872
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:34,540
Oh!

1873
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,160
Woo!

1874
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,940
This guy sounds right next to me.

1875
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,380
Uh...

1876
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,380
Uh...

1877
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:42,960
Uh...

1878
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,400
Wait, I'm trapped.

1879
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,040
Wait.

1880
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,440
There it is.

1881
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,980
I think they're right above me.

1882
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,740
I think they're right above me.

1883
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:56,980
Did I get a shield too?

1884
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:57,360
I did.

1885
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,360
Let's go.

1886
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,220
Okay.

1887
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,710
We are less afraid now.

1888
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,910
Everybody.

1889
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,310
We are less afraid.

1890
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:14,960
Wait, wait.

1891
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:15,720
Ouch!

1892
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,000
Oh, why isn't it working?

1893
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,380
Why doesn't it...

1894
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,600
Why doesn't it shield?

1895
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,800
Wait!

1896
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:21,620
Wait!

1897
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,580
What the hell is it doing?

1898
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,300
What is that?

1899
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,480
The shield isn't shielding!

1900
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,480
Wait, what the...

1901
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,300
How did I get that?

1902
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:47,380
What?

1903
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,820
Oh gosh.

1904
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,180
Guys, we can't...

1905
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,040
We can't die here.

1906
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,580
We can't die here.

1907
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,960
We have too much good stuff.

1908
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,180
Well, good is little, you know.

1909
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:05,850
Did I just see a sniffer in the water?

1910
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,590
As...

1911
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:08,630
What the hell?

1912
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,610
Don't you dare?

1913
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:18,630
Don't you dare?

1914
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:20,750
Deep dark, baby.

1915
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:23,890
Am I ready for the deep dark?

1916
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:25,350
Absolutely not.

1917
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:26,390
Will I...

1918
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,970
Oh my gosh, I almost jumped down, but I would have jumped into the...

1919
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,450
I would have jumped into the lava!

1920
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:34,590
Wait, can I jump down?

1921
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:38,070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I cannot.

1922
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,170
Why?

1923
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,210
Um, let's see.

1924
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:40,370
Okay, hold on.

1925
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,230
I wish I could use my shield now that I have it.

1926
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:52,680
Okay.

1927
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,660
I think from...

1928
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,240
Oh gosh.

1929
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:00,410
Uh, okay, hold on.

1930
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:00,870
I have an idea.

1931
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,230
Watch my genius.

1932
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:25,980
I did it.

1933
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,380
Is this an outside?

1934
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:29,720
Whoa!

1935
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:31,320
Whoa!

1936
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,600
How?

1937
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:34,940
How?

1938
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:35,780
How?

1939
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:35,980
Oh?

1940
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,950
It's an outside...

1941
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,060
Uh...

1942
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,360
Uh...

1943
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,380
Uh...

1944
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:44,720
Uh...

1945
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,160
Uh...

1946
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:45,240
Uh...

1947
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,440
Uh...

1948
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:46,800
That!

1949
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,580
Lush cave!

1950
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,200
Yeah, but it's not a cave at all!

1951
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,400
I hate destroying it, but I want to...

1952
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,580
Maybe get lush caves as a biome, you know?

1953
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,460
Wow!

1954
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:10,420
I want to get lush caves as a biome, maybe.

1955
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,320
Maybe if I destroy this...

1956
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,460
What the...

1957
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,540
Why isn't some of this destroying?

1958
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,260
Wait, uh...

1959
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:21,840
I messed up.

1960
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,700
There we go.

1961
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:26,640
Neat.

1962
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,280
This is neato!

1963
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,980
I've never seen one so, like...

1964
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:33,920
So...

1965
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,700
Out in the open.

1966
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,540
You know, like, sometimes you can find the caves that...

1967
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:39,660
Like...

1968
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,140
Go down really deep.

1969
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,100
And so you'll see, like, a lush cave from the outside.

1970
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,500
But, like, this is just...

1971
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,920
It just feels like it's a...

1972
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,700
Lush cave...

1973
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,420
Out...

1974
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:49,900
Outdoors.

1975
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,020
It's really weird.

1976
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,340
Meatou, meatou, meatou.

1977
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,520
That's my name, baby.

1978
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,620
Don't wear it out.

1979
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,760
I have to find the exit, though.

1980
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,160
Still.

1981
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,560
We even got the berries.

1982
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:05,980
Oh...

1983
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:06,960
How do I get the berries?

1984
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,680
And it's starting to get dark.

1985
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:10,400
Oh no!

1986
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,450
I see sniffers.

1987
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:26,530
There's sniffers everywhere!

1988
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:27,930
Look at all of them.

1989
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,310
Let's make a boat...

1990
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,150
And travel around.

1991
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:36,610
Let's make a boat, baby!

1992
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,230
A boat, a boat, a boat.

1993
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:45,040
I can't believe we got the deep dark biome, though.

1994
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:45,800
That's terrifying.

1995
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,640
I don't know if I like that.

1996
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,150
I don't know if I...

1997
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,460
Really want that.

1998
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,380
I think.

1999
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,300
I'm also gonna make some...

2000
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,850
Let's throw some things away.

2001
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:05,010
Like you.

2002
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,980
And we're gonna make some sticks.

2003
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,540
And...

2004
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,840
We're gonna make some torches.

2005
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,950
Whoa.

2006
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,260
I'm just gonna light up this area real quick.

2007
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,300
Okay.

2008
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,740
I just always feel safer with them, you know?

2009
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,080
What's that?

2010
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,120
Oh.

2011
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:35,340
Alright.

2012
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:35,980
Our boat.

2013
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,500
Our food.

2014
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:37,580
Our food.

2015
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,270
Evil and suffering biome.

2016
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,010
I know.

2017
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:48,470
Scary.

2018
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,170
Minecraft is a horror game.

2019
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:57,250
I want the...

2020
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,290
I want these, though.

2021
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:02,370
Oh.

2022
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:02,610
Oh, look.

2023
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:03,070
There's so many.

2024
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:03,910
There's more.

2025
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:04,350
There's more.

2026
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,110
Okay.

2027
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,560
Turn around.

2028
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,220
Cause it's scary.

2029
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:18,200
Woo!

2030
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,660
Look at this!

2031
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:24,500
Okay.

2032
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,800
What we're gonna do is take all of it.

2033
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:27,820
Maybe something will.

2034
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:28,940
Maybe?

2035
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:29,680
No?

2036
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,320
Okay.

2037
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:37,170
Nothing.

2038
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:37,310
Nothing.

2039
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:37,990
Okay.

2040
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:42,150
Am I throwing moss now instead of dirt?

2041
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:45,130
That seems to be...

2042
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:45,570
Yeah!

2043
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:46,110
I am.

2044
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:47,150
That seems to be the case.

2045
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,600
I love these cozy little cave areas.

2046
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:57,900
Right?

2047
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:58,580
They're so cute.

2048
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:04,670
Look in here.

2049
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:05,190
Oh, yep.

2050
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:06,190
I'm throwing moss.

2051
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:15,940
Okay.

2052
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,720
We got axolotls doing their things below us.

2053
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,400
But we gotta find the exit.

2054
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,760
I don't remember.

2055
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:24,320
It was...

2056
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,600
What was it again?

2057
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,320
To make the eye of...

2058
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,280
No.

2059
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,960
It was like the eye of end or something.

2060
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,700
I know it was copper.

2061
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,340
Which we've seen.

2062
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,340
Actually, now I think about it.

2063
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,040
Copper and something else.

2064
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,340
Copper and iron.

2065
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:45,940
Oh, I see.

2066
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:46,700
We don't have any iron.

2067
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,180
Well, that's okay.

2068
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,640
We can also just explore.

2069
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,800
Comfie Minto craft stream.

2070
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:55,720
Hi, Eric!

2071
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,020
Yosoro!

2072
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,260
Also, welcome to membership.

2073
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,460
Eye of exit.

2074
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:00,920
Yeah.

2075
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,320
Eye of exit.

2076
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,220
How we get out of here.

2077
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,580
We get our sniffers...

2078
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,040
Everywhere.

2079
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,200
Why does this look so ominous?

2080
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,960
There's like nothing beyond.

2081
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,380
I look so spooky.

2082
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:18,800
Oh, there it goes.

2083
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,960
Love exploring with Minto.

2084
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:23,560
Thanks!

2085
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,900
I also like just the exploring part.

2086
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,340
I guess that's why this version kind of tickles my fancy.

2087
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,300
Because...

2088
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,720
It's less about the building.

2089
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,200
Which I don't mind the building, obviously.

2090
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:38,860
Wow!

2091
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,180
Look at the...

2092
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:40,960
Rush!

2093
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:41,500
Wow!

2094
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:43,560
Wow!

2095
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,560
But I also just really like the exploring parts of Minecraft.

2096
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:49,840
And here we...

2097
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,720
It feels like we're always going to find something...

2098
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,400
Interesting and bizarre.

2099
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,040
Because all the worlds are strange.

2100
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:03,270
Stay away.

2101
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:09,270
But finding the exit can be a little...

2102
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,770
Tough.

2103
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,330
Like, what if I went the wrong way?

2104
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:20,330
Oh wait!

2105
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,970
There's multiple exits though, no?

2106
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:23,530
I remember.

2107
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,260
I remember somebody telling me that.

2108
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,900
Stay away from me, beast!

2109
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,480
Ugh!

2110
01:21:59,220 --> 01:21:59,580
Finally!

2111
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:00,820
Oh my gosh!

2112
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:01,620
Finally!

2113
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:03,720
Whoa!

2114
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,760
Look at the...

2115
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,620
The

2116
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,180
waterfalls in there.

2117
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:12,680
Crazy.

2118
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,680
Yay!

2119
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,120
We got a spitter.

2120
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,440
Spitter trophy.

2121
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,300
Very nice.

2122
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,780
Thank you!

2123
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,340
Thank you!

2124
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:29,740
Thank you!

2125
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:30,600
Thank you!

2126
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,360
If you manage to find an Amethyst Geode, it's basically free EXP.

2127
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,440
Amethyst blocks are worth quite a lot and easy to mine.

2128
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,140
Oh yeah!

2129
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,860
I have to really dig in there though, huh?

2130
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:48,240
I really have to dig...

2131
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,520
To find something like that.

2132
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,500
I don't need...

2133
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:52,100
Do they?

2134
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,480
Whoa!

2135
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:53,660
Whoa!

2136
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,860
These formations are crazy!

2137
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,040
I...

2138
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,880
I wonder though, does it...

2139
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,840
Like, is it...

2140
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:02,760
Have to be...

2141
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,400
In...

2142
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,440
Written into the world?

2143
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:05,880
You know?

2144
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,440
Diggy diggy ho!

2145
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:11,540
You're...

2146
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,380
Love your Half-Life stream.

2147
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,640
Sorry about not being on topic.

2148
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:17,800
Can't really watch...

2149
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,520
Streams now.

2150
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,100
But watching those vlogs...

2151
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,520
Really lifted my mood for those...

2152
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,640
For these two weeks!

2153
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:24,340
Oh!

2154
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:24,920
Sergey!

2155
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:26,760
Thank you!

2156
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:27,940
I'm happy about that.

2157
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:29,600
No worries.

2158
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,540
I'm streaming.

2159
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,440
I think it's on topic.

2160
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,720
I think it's on topic.

2161
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,280
What's a topic anyway, huh?

2162
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:44,810
Gosh.

2163
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,110
They're so violent behind me.

2164
01:23:57,050 --> 01:23:59,030
Let's not go towards the spiders.

2165
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,610
Let's go this way.

2166
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:02,650
Let's just keep going.

2167
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:05,330
Let's just keep going and going.

2168
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,400
I mean, I was sending my first ever super job to ask for the birthday song.

2169
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:16,480
It was my birthday yesterday.

2170
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:16,960
Oh!

2171
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,900
Happy birthday!

2172
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,480
Sorry, I missed it, S-Dog.

2173
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,160
Happy birthday to you.

2174
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,520
Happy birthday to you.

2175
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:32,020
Happy birthday, dear S-Dog.

2176
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,680
Make shizzle.

2177
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:37,100
Happy birthday.

2178
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,000
Happy birthday to you.

2179
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,520
What a name.

2180
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,780
What a name.

2181
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,560
Wowie.

2182
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:52,800
Cool.

2183
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:54,960
Let's see.

2184
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,140
I still wonder, now that it's not raining.

2185
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,640
Once the sun comes up, will the spiders still be hostile?

2186
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,080
Because if not, this is like easy mode.

2187
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:05,000
You know?

2188
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,940
I wonder if it just passed.

2189
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:16,940
I don't know.

2190
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:25,450
Crow, welcome to membership.

2191
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:26,290
Thank you.

2192
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:28,170
What's today?

2193
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:28,610
Wednesday?

2194
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:29,930
Yeah, it's Wednesday.

2195
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:30,910
I keep getting my...

2196
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:31,670
I'm all so...

2197
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:32,670
I'm so brain fogged.

2198
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:34,050
I keep getting all my days wrong.

2199
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:36,510
Oh!

2200
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:37,870
Never mind.

2201
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:38,270
He's faux.

2202
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:38,990
He's faux.

2203
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:43,550
He's just blind and didn't notice me at first.

2204
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:46,690
But it's not...

2205
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:48,270
Okay, now it's like fully day, right?

2206
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:49,870
It wasn't fully day before.

2207
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:51,050
Right?

2208
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:52,950
Now it's fully day.

2209
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:53,970
Right?

2210
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:00,980
Right?

2211
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:06,110
Hold on.

2212
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,630
We gotta go find another spider to test this out with.

2213
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:11,930
Willem Dafoe.

2214
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:13,310
Oh!

2215
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:14,110
I see it!

2216
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:14,810
I see the exit!

2217
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:18,630
What?

2218
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:19,050
Is he...

2219
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:20,130
The foe?

2220
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:22,990
William!

2221
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,870
Why are all the sniffers in the water?

2222
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,950
I don't understand why they get trapped like this.

2223
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:33,050
Okay, let's just run.

2224
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,720
It's over there.

2225
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,860
Petition to get mint a calendar.

2226
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,820
I don't know what's wrong.

2227
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:46,320
I think it's...

2228
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,540
I've been a little brain foggy.

2229
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:50,840
Lately.

2230
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,260
I mean, you know, as a ghost, it's like...

2231
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,280
Do days really matter?

2232
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,060
Time.

2233
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,760
What is time, anyway?

2234
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,050
Instead of brain, there is fog.

2235
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,130
Where did...

2236
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:17,670
Where did it go?

2237
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:19,470
Oh, over there.

2238
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:20,950
Aha!

2239
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:22,050
Wow!

2240
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,710
Finally, one that's not underwater.

2241
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:25,170
Nice.

2242
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:27,230
But I didn't get to test my spider theory!

2243
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:29,710
We gotta go find another spider first.

2244
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:33,070
There are gonna be arounds.

2245
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:34,090
Maybe not.

2246
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:37,290
Or despawn, because it's daytime.

2247
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:39,490
Just kidding.

2248
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:40,230
Okay, never mind.

2249
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,030
They're all gone.

2250
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:47,690
We can leave.

2251
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,070
Sink or swim, mint phantom.

2252
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:50,390
He has every turn game.

2253
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:55,550
What exactly is Tom?

2254
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:02,370
Even though he is an octopus.

2255
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:07,010
He's dead without him.

2256
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:10,170
I wonder when we'll get our next key.

2257
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:15,210
And we got a new spider.

2258
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:20,550
I think that's... I think the spider is actually... I don't think I got a spider trophy before.

2259
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:21,970
Let's check.

2260
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:24,370
Look at all this.

2261
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:31,430
Look at all these stinking... I have so many of the stupid silverfish though.

2262
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:35,810
Time is a tool you can put on your wall or wear it on your wrist.

2263
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:37,610
The past is far behind us.

2264
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:38,950
The future doesn't exist.

2265
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:42,430
I hope we can fart the fog away.

2266
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:43,130
What is happening?

2267
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,060
The maybe not so deep and also maybe not entirely dark.

2268
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,240
Wait, what else do we have in here?

2269
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:55,880
Spiders.

2270
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,180
Is this going to be terrifying?

2271
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,040
Maybe.

2272
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,940
Let's get some... Oh, I can't do... Oh, they have cows already.

2273
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,340
Let's do...

2274
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,800
Ocelots, obviously.

2275
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,560
And a piggies.

2276
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,320
What else do we have?

2277
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,760
Swamp biome.

2278
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:27,640
This is going to be horrifying.

2279
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:29,500
Maybe.

2280
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:31,120
Here we go.

2281
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,020
Depends

2282
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:41,350
on if you find him.

2283
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:46,170
Oh, wow.

2284
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:46,970
How awkward.

2285
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:52,370
So far?

2286
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:53,570
Wow.

2287
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:53,670
Wow.

2288
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,310
Look at all the... Wow.

2289
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,030
Look at this... Wait, are we floating island?

2290
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:00,430
Whoa.

2291
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,790
This is so weird.

2292
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:07,930
Where are all the trees?

2293
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:09,150
All the way over here.

2294
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:10,850
I need wood.

2295
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:12,710
Wait, here's some.

2296
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:15,450
Where's the...

2297
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:16,430
Where's the deep dark?

2298
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:17,290
I'm scared.

2299
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,510
So much lush biome.

2300
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,430
Maybe that's a good thing.

2301
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,690
Until I hear like a...

2302
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:24,930
You know, sound.

2303
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:26,410
The...

2304
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:27,850
How do you make that now?

2305
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:29,010
The...

2306
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:29,670
The...

2307
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:31,090
It's like a...

2308
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:31,550
It's like a...

2309
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:32,610
It's like a...

2310
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:32,870
It's like a...

2311
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:33,210
It's like a...

2312
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:37,230
You know what I'm talking about?

2313
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:39,570
It's weird on the surface.

2314
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:40,510
So weird.

2315
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:43,370
Will the warden appear on the surface?

2316
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,250
It'll be too bright for him.

2317
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:46,530
No.

2318
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,110
Right?

2319
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:49,390
See, like...

2320
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:51,570
I'm used to seeing sometimes lush caves like this.

2321
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:54,110
If like there's a big old crevice.

2322
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:55,350
But...

2323
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,390
Anything else is...

2324
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:57,170
This is really...

2325
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:58,110
It's so flat.

2326
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:00,290
It's...

2327
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,690
Shut up.

2328
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,270
Is that a family of ocelots?

2329
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:05,450
Look at all of them.

2330
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:06,330
You guys.

2331
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:10,430
Why are there so many cats?

2332
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,970
Why are there so...

2333
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:17,230
Little babies.

2334
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:18,510
Little babies.

2335
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,790
There's so many ocelots.

2336
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:24,670
Why are there so many of them?

2337
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,280
Oh my gosh.

2338
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,080
I've never seen so many ocelots.

2339
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,800
I don't think I've ever seen a baby ocelot.

2340
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,200
Where?

2341
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:42,220
Where?

2342
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:44,520
No.

2343
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,060
No.

2344
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:45,560
No.

2345
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:46,360
No.

2346
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:47,280
Where is he?

2347
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,560
Where is he?

2348
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:59,010
I pretend I do not see.

2349
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,430
Nothing happened just then.

2350
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:03,130
Anyway.

2351
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:03,650
Alright.

2352
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,550
We got some wood.

2353
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:07,170
Let's uh...

2354
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:08,850
Let's also upgrade.

2355
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,470
I only got 14 levels.

2356
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:11,330
That's not so good.

2357
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:13,090
Before we like...

2358
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:14,510
We killed it.

2359
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:15,630
We got so many.

2360
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:17,790
I can't even shield bash.

2361
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,050
Um...

2362
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:19,510
Chopper.

2363
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:23,250
Bring a snack with you.

2364
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,510
We could start getting...

2365
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,020
Maybe an archer would be good.

2366
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,160
Get more experience upgrades.

2367
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,120
Where are those at?

2368
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,260
Where are those at?

2369
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,340
Crafting table.

2370
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,160
Smelt.

2371
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,040
Need for speed.

2372
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,080
Dirt?

2373
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,520
Where's the dirt?

2374
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,540
Sorry.

2375
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:53,380
I thought I heard something.

2376
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,000
Bottom of the first tab.

2377
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,180
The jump?

2378
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,220
One.

2379
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:06,150
Ah!

2380
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:07,290
Get more experience.

2381
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,830
Thank you.

2382
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:07,990
Yeah.

2383
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:08,350
Okay.

2384
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:09,250
Let's do this.

2385
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:10,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2386
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:10,270
Okay.

2387
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:10,990
Cool, cool, cool.

2388
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:12,390
Thank you.

2389
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:12,670
Sorry.

2390
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:14,510
I didn't realize that that's what those were.

2391
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:17,870
I'm also gonna get swift sneaking because we're about to uh...

2392
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:18,390
You know...

2393
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:20,670
We're about...

2394
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:22,930
I think actually even last time I was just like...

2395
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,310
I don't need this unless we have the deep dark, baby.

2396
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:28,430
Which um...

2397
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:29,110
Welcome.

2398
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:29,930
I guess.

2399
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:30,910
Where is it?

2400
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:33,470
Where's the deep dark?

2401
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:37,950
I already see the exit.

2402
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:38,550
No way.

2403
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:42,550
Easiest biome ever.

2404
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,660
I like the fireflies.

2405
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:54,980
Underground?

2406
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,440
Let's see if we can find it.

2407
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:08,730
Because there's not really a way to get underground, as you can see.

2408
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:11,810
We're floating in the sky.

2409
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:17,230
Underground doesn't really exist.

2410
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:21,490
So...

2411
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:25,670
Wish I could get some coal, though.

2412
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:28,630
So I could cook my food and run.

2413
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:35,130
Do I have any stone even?

2414
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:35,490
Nothing.

2415
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:47,150
I don't even see...

2416
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,890
I see a bunch of spiders down there.

2417
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:51,530
Wow, that's kind of pretty.

2418
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:54,830
But I don't see where deep dark even would be at.

2419
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:55,370
You know?

2420
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:57,510
I don't think it exists.

2421
01:34:58,570 --> 01:34:59,310
Do a flip.

2422
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:03,210
If I went down there...

2423
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:06,910
Baby.

2424
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:08,250
Little babies.

2425
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09,110
Little babies.

2426
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:09,790
Oh my gosh.

2427
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:12,150
Why are there so many of them in one place?

2428
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,510
I don't think the deep dark exists, you guys.

2429
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:18,750
Oh, we can eat the berries.

2430
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:20,490
This is good, actually.

2431
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:24,230
We can eat the berries.

2432
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,590
Give me.

2433
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:28,250
Here's our sustenance.

2434
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:33,710
Instead of eating raw meat, I guess.

2435
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:36,470
Ocelot trophy.

2436
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:37,170
How do I...

2437
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,830
Wait, what do you mean, ocelot trophy?

2438
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:41,210
Oh, by killing them?

2439
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:41,950
No, shut up.

2440
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:45,130
That's horrible.

2441
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,310
That's horrifying.

2442
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:51,690
How dare you even suggest...

2443
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:58,370
Such a heinous act.

2444
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:08,080
By kissing them?

2445
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,820
Hello, little Axelot.

2446
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:12,680
Oh, you're so cute.

2447
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:15,140
Wonder if I can get a trophy for him.

2448
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:18,000
Come here.

2449
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,480
Wait, what was that?

2450
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:22,480
Wait, what?

2451
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,890
I got something.

2452
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:33,430
Wait, what...

2453
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,290
What did I...

2454
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:36,070
What was the spell that I just cast?

2455
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:39,730
Guys, we got guardians.

2456
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:43,810
That seems kind of terrifying as well.

2457
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,150
I don't think the deep...

2458
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:49,510
Did I...

2459
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,350
I did add it.

2460
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:50,670
No.

2461
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:52,490
Like, I did add it to the world.

2462
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:53,230
I don't just...

2463
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:53,910
Don't think it exists.

2464
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:55,730
Huh.

2465
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:57,330
How disappointing.

2466
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:02,310
It's rare-ish.

2467
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:03,250
Oh.

2468
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:06,150
On top of your screen?

2469
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,750
Oh, yeah.

2470
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:07,350
It is there.

2471
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:08,770
Huh.

2472
01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:10,810
Maybe because it's like...

2473
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:11,430
Rare, usually.

2474
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:14,330
It's rare to find it in here as well.

2475
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:15,890
You know.

2476
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,390
It's not as...

2477
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:21,270
Vast as I thought it would be.

2478
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:26,210
Whoa.

2479
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:30,230
This is so bizarre.

2480
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,530
We can try again, though.

2481
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:36,110
Maybe...

2482
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:37,430
Without...

2483
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:44,110
The Lush Games have overpowered everything.

2484
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,170
I need to write.

2485
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:46,930
I'm good.

2486
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:49,030
I'm gonna try murdering more innocent creatures.

2487
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,570
So that maybe we can unlock other things.

2488
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:53,930
So if I murder this guy...

2489
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:54,870
Sorry.

2490
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:55,910
I'm so sorry.

2491
01:37:57,890 --> 01:37:59,350
I didn't get anything.

2492
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:00,170
Except...

2493
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:01,170
No, I got something.

2494
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:02,050
I got guilt.

2495
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:06,950
I've unlocked guilt.

2496
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:07,910
Oh.

2497
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:08,290
What?

2498
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:09,550
Oh, see?

2499
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:11,430
Wednesday frogs?

2500
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:14,850
It is Wednesday, my dudes.

2501
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:16,010
Wait.

2502
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:16,690
Actually...

2503
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:18,750
How do they know it's Wednesday?

2504
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,320
How do they know?

2505
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,320
Okay.

2506
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:33,840
Oh, God.

2507
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:34,400
I...

2508
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,840
I need to close my eyes for this one.

2509
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:43,170
Oh, no.

2510
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:44,270
I'm running out of...

2511
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:44,830
Stamina.

2512
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,780
I'm so sorry.

2513
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,560
I'm gonna get mad cow disease.

2514
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:53,500
You guys, we have to do it.

2515
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,720
We have to see if we get anything.

2516
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:03,120
I'm sorry.

2517
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:03,880
I'm sorry.

2518
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:04,460
I'm sorry.

2519
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:05,040
I'm sorry.

2520
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,220
Oh.

2521
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:08,680
Okay.

2522
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,660
You're going way further than I...

2523
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,680
Want to go.

2524
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:16,180
I can't tell if that's deep dark or not.

2525
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,780
Let's just leave this one.

2526
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,200
This world's strange, but I think we've kind of gotten everything.

2527
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,860
Boss, you just murdered a child.

2528
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,680
Oh, my God.

2529
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:29,420
The whole family.

2530
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,620
Stop running with me.

2531
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:31,780
Wait.

2532
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:32,680
Where'd the exit go?

2533
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:33,740
Oh.

2534
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,780
I lost the exit.

2535
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,120
Yellow closet time, paradox.

2536
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:43,020
I lost the exit.

2537
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,880
It was like over here somewhere.

2538
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,240
It was...

2539
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:55,520
Ah!

2540
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:56,380
Right here.

2541
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:02,150
We can leave.

2542
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:03,330
Fine.

2543
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:04,730
Right.

2544
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:05,690
We don't get a lot.

2545
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:07,850
But we get two more new things, which is kind of fun.

2546
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:14,070
And

2547
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:21,660
I might be able to...

2548
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:26,750
Unlock...

2549
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,370
A little bit more.

2550
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:44,630
That was your favorite world so far?

2551
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:46,710
Nice.

2552
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,030
Oh!

2553
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:50,470
Igloo in space!

2554
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:51,470
Uh-oh.

2555
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:52,470
It's a boss world.

2556
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:53,690
You guys!

2557
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:55,830
Uh-oh.

2558
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:56,790
Uh-oh.

2559
01:40:57,010 --> 01:40:57,610
Ha-ha-ha!

2560
01:40:57,770 --> 01:40:58,430
Uh-oh.

2561
01:41:00,450 --> 01:41:01,730
What does this mean?

2562
01:41:03,170 --> 01:41:04,670
Well, we have a shield.

2563
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:06,750
Ruining the game.

2564
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:17,690
A fox.

2565
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:20,830
Huh?

2566
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,930
How am I supposed to...

2567
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:27,950
do anything?

2568
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:31,630
There's snowmen over there!

2569
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:32,930
Wait, there's snowmen everywhere!

2570
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:33,730
What?

2571
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,950
And polar bears!

2572
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,600
Wait.

2573
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:43,540
I hope you're doing well today.

2574
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,380
Thank you for the stream.

2575
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,520
I saw a cute video with several clips of you singing...

2576
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,220
Minky, Minky, Minky.

2577
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:47,760
Ha-ha!

2578
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,480
Yeah, I do say that sometimes.

2579
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,120
Check the basement.

2580
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:52,900
Oh, is there one?

2581
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:54,560
Oh!

2582
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:57,230
Wait!

2583
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,490
What did I just unlock?

2584
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:00,190
Cave world?

2585
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,970
Is that not what we're doing now?

2586
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:07,410
Oh, there's no guy.

2587
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:08,450
Oh!

2588
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:10,110
Look at that!

2589
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:11,730
Huge!

2590
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:12,170
Huge!

2591
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:12,550
Huge!

2592
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:21,890
Oh, wait.

2593
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:22,830
I got a...

2594
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:23,870
potion of weakness.

2595
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:25,270
A splash potion of weakness.

2596
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,500
How do I...

2597
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:42,820
Oh my god!

2598
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:44,540
Stop screaming!

2599
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:45,440
You're scaring me!

2600
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,500
How do I...

2601
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,140
How do I traverse?

2602
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:53,660
How do I traverse?

2603
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:02,750
Sleep to make it day?

2604
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:03,470
I'm gonna...

2605
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:05,070
I'm gonna show you right now, buddy.

2606
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:06,770
No sleep for you!

2607
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:07,390
Not today!

2608
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:09,250
Wait, what's this, uh...

2609
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,010
What does this mean?

2610
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:12,630
Oh, igloo in space.

2611
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:12,930
Okay.

2612
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,220
Um...

2613
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:18,700
Gotta build a bridge, I guess.

2614
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,620
That's what I'm thinking.

2615
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:25,590
But I can't collect snow.

2616
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:26,370
Oh, wait.

2617
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:27,290
We can collect stone.

2618
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,640
Let's take apart this little world.

2619
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,500
I'm glad that snow doesn't cave in, you know?

2620
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,920
Like, how...

2621
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:50,980
Um...

2622
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:52,320
But how do I get back...

2623
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:52,860
I guess...

2624
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:54,780
We'll just use some of the stone to get back out.

2625
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:59,000
But yeah, I'm glad it doesn't cave in like how sand does.

2626
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,300
Does she know how to make a cobblestone generator?

2627
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,160
Oh!

2628
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,320
That's probably why they gave me this...

2629
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:10,860
The lava!

2630
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:12,000
Uh...

2631
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:12,500
I'll be honest.

2632
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:13,560
I don't know how to make it.

2633
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,320
Like...

2634
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:16,520
I don't know.

2635
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:17,040
Actually.

2636
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:21,580
Oh.

2637
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:22,360
Oopsie.

2638
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:22,920
Oh.

2639
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:23,720
Tuh!

2640
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,600
It's just like...

2641
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:29,940
Hold

2642
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:41,360
on.

2643
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:42,500
Let me get out of here first.

2644
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:46,960
Make some stairs.

2645
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:47,340
Okay.

2646
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,480
And then I like waterlog the stairs or something...

2647
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:53,740
Something...

2648
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:54,880
I don't...

2649
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:55,020
Okay.

2650
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:55,400
Hold on.

2651
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:56,280
Stairs.

2652
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,940
First crafting table.

2653
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:58,760
Oh.

2654
01:44:59,060 --> 01:44:59,440
Oh.

2655
01:44:59,640 --> 01:44:59,760
Ah.

2656
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:00,180
I have.

2657
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:00,460
I have.

2658
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:00,760
I have.

2659
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:01,060
I have.

2660
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:01,420
I have.

2661
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:03,860
Stairs.

2662
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:24,870
Just don't allow the water to flow into the source lava.

2663
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:27,710
It's like...

2664
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:34,480
Hold on.

2665
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,120
I'm going to look it up.

2666
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,120
What's the word?

2667
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,400
Cobblestone farm.

2668
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:47,840
But like super easy.

2669
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:51,160
Wait.

2670
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,500
These ones don't show stairs.

2671
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,560
Cobblestone generator.

2672
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,920
Farm gets me.

2673
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:11,820
Generator, not farm.

2674
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:12,220
Okay.

2675
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:13,300
Generator.

2676
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:31,440
Yeah.

2677
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:35,360
I saw someone also say that the lava might melt the ice.

2678
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:39,020
Which could potentially hurt our farm.

2679
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:42,080
So let's stick down to the stone.

2680
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:49,750
Or we could do it down here actually.

2681
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,570
Now I think about it.

2682
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:55,340
Yeah.

2683
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:56,220
We can just do it here.

2684
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:02,670
There's snow.

2685
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,390
Ah!

2686
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:05,090
What?

2687
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:05,790
What?

2688
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:06,350
Why?

2689
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:12,370
Dang it.

2690
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:15,110
Nasty creature.

2691
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:21,270
Okay.

2692
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:26,330
Luckily we have more water if I do mess up.

2693
01:47:26,830 --> 01:47:27,310
You know?

2694
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:31,070
What I will do instead is I will...

2695
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:34,130
Create something like here in the corner.

2696
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:34,570
You know?

2697
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:36,890
So...

2698
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:38,690
Like we'll just...

2699
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:39,430
Like this.

2700
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:46,410
Like so, right?

2701
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:51,050
So that we don't have to worry about any...

2702
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:54,850
Any...

2703
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:55,250
Any...

2704
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:57,470
Issue with snow.

2705
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:00,330
Okay.

2706
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:04,210
But I just don't know...

2707
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:04,550
Hold on.

2708
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:05,850
I'm gonna watch a YouTube video.

2709
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:11,830
How to make a cobblestone generator in Minecraft.

2710
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:16,830
You need a water bucket, bucket of lava.

2711
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:20,470
One, two, three, four.

2712
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:21,890
Four line.

2713
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:23,350
Is that how many I did?

2714
01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:26,430
One, two, three, four.

2715
01:48:26,530 --> 01:48:27,530
Oh, I did an extra one.

2716
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:27,990
That's fine.

2717
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:29,550
That's fine.

2718
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:32,550
Then...

2719
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:32,910
Then...

2720
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:33,750
We'll do...

2721
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:37,750
From the third block on the line...

2722
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:40,250
Dig one more block down.

2723
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:42,170
Well, this still worked.

2724
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:42,890
Is this still...

2725
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:43,610
Is this still...

2726
01:48:43,610 --> 01:48:45,490
A valid farm, I wonder.

2727
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:55,770
No!

2728
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:56,270
Oh, wait.

2729
01:48:56,330 --> 01:48:57,490
What we can do is this...

2730
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:01,650
Watch my genius.

2731
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:04,170
What did I need stairs for?

2732
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:05,830
What?

2733
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:09,890
The physics didn't change.

2734
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:10,150
Okay.

2735
01:49:10,970 --> 01:49:11,150
Cool.

2736
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:19,480
Place the water bucket on the last block on the right.

2737
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:19,860
Okay.

2738
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:21,280
Alright.

2739
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,020
And then...

2740
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:24,320
Lava.

2741
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,220
Place the lava on the far left block.

2742
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,760
Once the lava...

2743
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,180
It'll create cobblestone.

2744
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:32,840
And that's it?

2745
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:39,390
That's it?

2746
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,840
Stairs are to prevent the water from flowing.

2747
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,960
But I think that's what this hole is supposed to do, no?

2748
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,000
Yeah, like that.

2749
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,600
And then...

2750
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:55,840
If I dig here...

2751
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,000
Wait.

2752
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,180
Hold on.

2753
01:49:59,120 --> 01:49:59,580
Oh.

2754
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:00,340
Uh...

2755
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:00,720
Wait.

2756
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,620
How do I collect it?

2757
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:03,500
Um.

2758
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:25,500
Oh.

2759
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:26,960
Oh.

2760
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:27,500
Oh.

2761
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:28,440
Oh.

2762
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:35,020
Oh!

2763
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,140
I got that one!

2764
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:43,090
Okay, I am...

2765
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:43,990
I am getting them!

2766
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:50,590
Oh.

2767
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:52,630
It's like a one in...

2768
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:54,610
Something chance.

2769
01:50:58,170 --> 01:50:58,590
Yeah!

2770
01:50:59,610 --> 01:51:00,650
Look, look, look, look, look!

2771
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:02,130
Four...

2772
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:04,330
Five...

2773
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:05,910
We missed that one.

2774
01:51:06,090 --> 01:51:06,750
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2775
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:07,610
It's down here.

2776
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,030
Slow, but it works.

2777
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:10,750
You know what?

2778
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:12,430
This is so good, actually.

2779
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:13,650
Because...

2780
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:15,150
Because...

2781
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:16,250
Um...

2782
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:17,650
Because...

2783
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:19,530
We can always come back here, you know?

2784
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:23,230
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave a torch here.

2785
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:28,030
So that we know this is the home base of our cobblestone generator.

2786
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:29,550
If we...

2787
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,170
Have to come back!

2788
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:33,130
How do we get out of here?

2789
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:36,430
Holy cow.

2790
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:38,250
I don't even...

2791
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:39,630
Do you think those guys are friends?

2792
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:43,290
First off, let's travel.

2793
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:44,390
This feels like...

2794
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:46,330
This feels like, uh...

2795
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:47,050
Being in a...

2796
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:47,530
What's it called?

2797
01:51:48,290 --> 01:51:48,790
Um...

2798
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:50,530
The one block dimension, you know?

2799
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:51,710
Or...

2800
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:52,430
No, not one block.

2801
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,030
Um...

2802
01:51:56,030 --> 01:51:57,870
The, uh...

2803
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:01,630
After you beat the ender dragon.

2804
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:05,130
No, not sky block.

2805
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:05,810
I've never done that.

2806
01:52:07,070 --> 01:52:08,090
I know what you...

2807
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:10,450
I can infer what it means from the name.

2808
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:13,610
Use slabs.

2809
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:14,810
You're right!

2810
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,000
Slab.

2811
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:32,760
We've doubled our property value.

2812
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,920
In the end...

2813
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2814
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,400
You guys think these are friends?

2815
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:43,940
They're not...

2816
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:44,780
They can't be foes.

2817
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:52,580
They're...

2818
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,440
They're snowmen.

2819
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:54,740
They love me.

2820
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:58,240
Hello!

2821
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,540
Hello, friends.

2822
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:05,940
What do you got here?

2823
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:11,990
Don't push me.

2824
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:12,750
Don't push me.

2825
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:14,110
I thought we were friends.

2826
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:15,210
Don't push me.

2827
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:20,370
I didn't realize they were so...

2828
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:20,930
Fragile.

2829
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:23,970
Uh...

2830
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,580
I see it!

2831
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,640
You see...

2832
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:30,420
You guys see it?

2833
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:31,580
All the way up there?

2834
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,840
That's the exit.

2835
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:34,700
Oh my gosh, I see it.

2836
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:35,620
It's very...

2837
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:36,600
It's very small.

2838
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,340
Where my crosshairs are pointing is right there.

2839
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:41,560
Oh.

2840
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:43,520
Gosh.

2841
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,380
I need a lot more cobblestone.

2842
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,200
I need a lot more cobblestone.

2843
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,540
Oh my god.

2844
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:07,350
What I also want to do is I also want to grab some more water.

2845
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:09,130
Never mind.

2846
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:11,490
Please!

2847
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:13,570
Okay, never mind.

2848
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:16,030
I was going to say I want to grab some more water so that...

2849
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,870
Um...

2850
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:20,470
So that...

2851
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:21,450
Uh...

2852
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:23,340
I could...

2853
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:25,030
You know, just in case I start...

2854
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:26,450
I actually fall or something.

2855
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:28,750
Oh!

2856
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:30,990
I thought I went too fast.

2857
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:33,290
Please.

2858
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,000
This is like the slowest process ever.

2859
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:58,230
I could take the water and lava with you.

2860
01:54:59,150 --> 01:54:59,630
True.

2861
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:02,410
Oh, well, that's the...

2862
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:02,970
Well, yeah.

2863
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:04,910
I guess we could build it with the...

2864
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:06,690
With the cobblestone.

2865
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:08,730
Because my only thing is the...

2866
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:10,630
Is the ice.

2867
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:11,370
You know?

2868
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:13,630
Oh, come on.

2869
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:14,110
Please.

2870
01:55:16,850 --> 01:55:17,290
Eh!

2871
01:55:17,730 --> 01:55:18,630
Mind the block here?

2872
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:26,350
Aha.

2873
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:29,330
I was scared about getting...

2874
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:30,330
Lava'd.

2875
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:32,010
But it doesn't seem to be the case.

2876
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:33,090
Okay.

2877
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:34,890
Oh.

2878
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:36,230
Oh.

2879
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:40,030
Heard about the big event coming up at some point.

2880
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:40,670
Oh, the joy!

2881
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:41,250
Thank you!

2882
01:55:43,390 --> 01:55:44,750
Still at work when it was brought up.

2883
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:45,550
So proud and excited.

2884
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:46,530
I'd also take a break sometimes.

2885
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:46,890
Wait, wait.

2886
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:47,630
Thank you!

2887
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:49,990
Thank you!

2888
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:50,510
Thank you!

2889
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:54,330
Come on!

2890
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:56,870
Um.

2891
01:55:58,830 --> 01:55:59,230
Nah.

2892
01:56:00,130 --> 01:56:01,090
We'll get there.

2893
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:02,930
Eventually.

2894
01:56:03,190 --> 01:56:03,470
Someday.

2895
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:05,770
Let's put some of this stuff away.

2896
01:56:05,890 --> 01:56:06,530
The stuff that...

2897
01:56:06,530 --> 01:56:07,150
I was like...

2898
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:07,790
Oh, I need this.

2899
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:09,050
But I don't actually need it.

2900
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,650
Oh!

2901
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:11,530
No!

2902
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:12,990
I don't have anything...

2903
01:56:12,990 --> 01:56:14,370
That I can cook my potatoes!

2904
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:16,050
Oh, man.

2905
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:34,050
Very slowly...

2906
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:37,750
It doesn't help that it's like one...

2907
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:38,570
It's like...

2908
01:56:38,570 --> 01:56:39,890
50-50 chance.

2909
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:47,660
Take care of your presence is comforting.

2910
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:48,580
I'm not...

2911
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:49,240
Guys...

2912
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:51,300
I think we need to talk about this.

2913
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,180
I'm not supposed to be comforting.

2914
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:57,320
I'm supposed to be a very spooky, scary ghost.

2915
01:56:58,340 --> 01:56:59,320
I am.

2916
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:00,700
Some random person.

2917
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:01,520
Thank you so much for the talk.

2918
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,360
Thank you!

2919
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,560
I'm supposed to be like a really terrifying...

2920
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:07,780
Horrifying...

2921
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:08,820
Like...

2922
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:11,540
Nightmare fuel...

2923
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:13,520
Paralysis...

2924
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:14,880
Demon...

2925
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,780
Type of ghost.

2926
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:16,260
This is...

2927
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:17,980
Ha ha ha ha!

2928
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:27,510
Oh my god!

2929
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:31,650
This is...

2930
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:32,830
Inefficient!

2931
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:34,650
Inefficient!

2932
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:36,270
Oh...

2933
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:37,130
Oh...

2934
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:38,590
Oh...

2935
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:39,990
I...

2936
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:43,170
The tree and the charcoal...

2937
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:43,750
True.

2938
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:46,210
But there's no tree on my little island.

2939
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:46,910
Unfortunately.

2940
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:47,610
Wait!

2941
01:57:47,690 --> 01:57:48,310
Is there some in here?

2942
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:49,050
No!

2943
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:51,010
But I will take this.

2944
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:51,830
Ha ha ha ha!

2945
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:54,190
So we don't have to use any of our resources.

2946
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:01,960
Eek a ghost!

2947
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:02,480
Yes!

2948
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:02,920
Yes!

2949
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:04,740
That is an appropriate reaction.

2950
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,340
That's an appropriate reaction.

2951
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:13,400
It's scary how cute you are.

2952
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:22,770
If I use a shovel for the snow...

2953
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:23,490
Do I get to keep it?

2954
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:24,810
Or does it have to have a...

2955
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:25,510
What's the word?

2956
01:58:27,110 --> 01:58:28,390
But also, I can't...

2957
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:28,670
Oh wait!

2958
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:29,250
I have a shovel.

2959
01:58:29,410 --> 01:58:29,790
I was gonna say.

2960
01:58:29,890 --> 01:58:30,750
I can't make a shovel.

2961
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:32,570
Does it have a...

2962
01:58:32,570 --> 01:58:32,950
No.

2963
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:34,250
Let's see.

2964
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:36,170
Oh wait!

2965
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:36,990
But I can...

2966
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:38,190
I can make it myself.

2967
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:38,870
Can't I?

2968
01:58:39,650 --> 01:58:42,050
I can make the blocks with...

2969
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:42,570
Oh gosh!

2970
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:43,350
I gotta be careful.

2971
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:44,490
Holy cow!

2972
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:45,650
I gotta be careful.

2973
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:46,610
Oh!

2974
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:47,350
Wait!

2975
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:48,190
Up!

2976
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:48,910
Up!

2977
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:52,350
Snowy biome!

2978
01:58:55,130 --> 01:58:56,950
I can make my own blocks.

2979
01:58:58,490 --> 01:58:59,130
Snow.

2980
01:59:02,570 --> 01:59:03,210
Yeah!

2981
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:07,730
Thank you.

2982
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,630
For reminding me about this.

2983
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:12,470
Gosh, it's been so long since I've played Minecraft.

2984
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:13,810
That it's like I...

2985
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:14,470
It's...

2986
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:14,810
It's...

2987
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:16,910
I do feel like you have to...

2988
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:21,470
Use every single Minecraft knowledge you've ever known to...

2989
01:59:21,470 --> 01:59:22,430
Play this properly.

2990
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:25,950
Sorry.

2991
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,390
Sorry.

2992
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:27,190
Sorry, work is busy.

2993
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:27,810
No!

2994
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:30,030
Please do take breaks.

2995
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:31,090
I'm okay!

2996
01:59:34,130 --> 01:59:35,130
Thank you though.

2997
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:36,710
Thank you for the pink targo.

2998
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:45,050
What if I get rid of all of the...

2999
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:45,970
Of the snow?

3000
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:55,780
Snow.

3001
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:56,780
This is good though.

3002
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:57,760
Snowblocks.

3003
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,120
We're making a lot of them.

3004
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:00,460
In a short amount of time.

3005
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:01,380
So.

3006
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:05,060
I don't want to fall into the void.

3007
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:15,190
All right.

3008
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:15,930
There's some more.

3009
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:16,910
Okay.

3010
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:18,750
Snow.

3011
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:20,610
You're absurd.

3012
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:21,570
Thank you.

3013
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:22,930
Yeah.

3014
02:00:25,490 --> 02:00:27,210
Wait, I can craft them in my inventory?

3015
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:27,590
I can?

3016
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:27,610
I can.

3017
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:32,770
Oh.

3018
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:35,790
Wow.

3019
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:44,750
Snow.

3020
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:47,370
Snow.

3021
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:49,090
Okay.

3022
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:50,110
All right.

3023
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:51,490
We're getting somewhere now, baby.

3024
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:52,090
Okay.

3025
02:00:52,270 --> 02:00:54,090
We're soon going to take off on our journey.

3026
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:54,630
I promise.

3027
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:58,370
Honestly, the snow blocks might be better than the cobblestone.

3028
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:02,070
Might be a better strat than the cobblestone.

3029
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:03,510
But I am...

3030
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:06,630
I think I might take our search on the road.

3031
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:08,150
Or like our setup on the road.

3032
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:17,260
I'm still going to leave this so that we know where we began.

3033
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:18,300
Our humble beginnings.

3034
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:31,350
I'm going to take our setup on the road.

3035
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:35,050
So give me...

3036
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:36,230
Our buckets.

3037
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:36,870
Oh!

3038
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:38,010
I had more!

3039
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:43,190
Smoo.

3040
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:45,010
Smoo.

3041
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,180
Okay.

3042
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:51,300
Where'd our buckets go?

3043
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,140
Oh, here they are.

3044
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:53,640
I'm silly.

3045
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:56,900
Okay.

3046
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:58,860
Smoo.

3047
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,760
Every floating island gives us more snow.

3048
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:03,580
Oh, that's what I'm saying.

3049
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:06,280
We're going to take...

3050
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:07,600
Oh, we'll take it.

3051
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:11,240
Because it might be hard to find wood sometimes.

3052
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,380
And that should be it.

3053
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:25,790
Guys, this is a...

3054
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:27,530
This is a harrowing experience.

3055
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:29,090
It was like...

3056
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:30,010
It was over that way.

3057
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:37,110
I could go to that tree.

3058
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:38,610
I think about it.

3059
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:40,610
But I'm already here.

3060
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:42,950
So...

3061
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:44,170
Oh, there's a tree right in front of me.

3062
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:45,130
We're fine.

3063
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:48,590
I wonder if it's going to stay night.

3064
02:02:52,630 --> 02:02:53,690
What's the shriek?

3065
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:56,750
Oh, that scared me.

3066
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,130
It's, uh...

3067
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:00,350
It's, um...

3068
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:01,310
The fox down there.

3069
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:02,210
He keeps yelling.

3070
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:08,400
Hello, Mr. Bear.

3071
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,160
Don't mind me.

3072
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,420
You have no children.

3073
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,370
Don't mind me.

3074
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:20,190
I'm going to block you with me.

3075
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:24,010
Okay.

3076
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:26,110
Hello, sir.

3077
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:31,230
Kind of wanting to kill the bear.

3078
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:32,950
See if we can get anything from him.

3079
02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:34,670
You know?

3080
02:03:34,950 --> 02:03:35,410
Oh my gosh.

3081
02:03:35,410 --> 02:03:36,050
It's so dark.

3082
02:03:36,170 --> 02:03:36,910
I can't see anything.

3083
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:41,360
Oh, I want to maybe kill the bear.

3084
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,300
Maybe I would like to...

3085
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:46,560
Destroy the bear.

3086
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:54,930
Did he hurt me?

3087
02:03:57,510 --> 02:03:58,630
Maybe I deserve that.

3088
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:05,800
Where'd my...

3089
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,840
Where'd my wood go?

3090
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,040
Okay.

3091
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:09,320
I use...

3092
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,780
I can use the logs, no?

3093
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:11,620
To...

3094
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:12,960
Instead...

3095
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:15,220
Uh...

3096
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:15,920
Let's do this.

3097
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,020
You here.

3098
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:18,140
And then the log.

3099
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:19,340
And then the potato.

3100
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:20,100
Nice.

3101
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:23,380
You see it up there, guys?

3102
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,640
You can see it.

3103
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:28,320
You can just barely see it.

3104
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:31,540
Okay.

3105
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:33,500
Why are we destroying bears?

3106
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:34,920
Well, you know...

3107
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,620
They could have added valuable resource.

3108
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:42,580
They could have given me a seed.

3109
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:43,180
Wait.

3110
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:48,090
Okay, okay.

3111
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:50,070
Okay, okay.

3112
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:50,630
Okay.

3113
02:04:51,470 --> 02:04:52,450
Okay, okay, okay.

3114
02:04:54,850 --> 02:04:55,850
Okay, okay, okay.

3115
02:04:56,170 --> 02:04:58,770
I'm surprised I'm not throwing any...

3116
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:00,730
What's it called yet?

3117
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,690
I haven't been throwing any sorts of blocks.

3118
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:04,190
You know?

3119
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:06,630
Not that I can tell.

3120
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:12,190
Oh no, it's going down fast.

3121
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:14,810
It's not gonna be able to cook all my...

3122
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:15,570
Potato!

3123
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:25,290
Oh no!

3124
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:27,570
Oh no!

3125
02:05:28,150 --> 02:05:28,930
Oh no!

3126
02:05:30,650 --> 02:05:32,330
Let's also make some more snow.

3127
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:35,410
Nice.

3128
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:37,510
And I'm gonna keep all of our...

3129
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:39,830
Things of like, you know...

3130
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:41,250
I'm gonna get rid of the carpet.

3131
02:05:42,070 --> 02:05:42,510
Goodbye.

3132
02:05:44,090 --> 02:05:44,970
Goodbye carpet.

3133
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:47,110
So these are our seeds.

3134
02:05:50,530 --> 02:05:51,050
Ah.

3135
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:52,310
Okay.

3136
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:53,110
Well, we got...

3137
02:05:53,110 --> 02:05:53,630
We got seven.

3138
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:54,330
That's not so bad.

3139
02:05:56,330 --> 02:05:57,270
Could have been worse.

3140
02:05:58,090 --> 02:05:58,890
All right.

3141
02:05:59,590 --> 02:06:00,210
I'll take you.

3142
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:03,990
And um...

3143
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:05,190
Up we go, baby!

3144
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:12,320
White!

3145
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:17,400
There's some wood.

3146
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:19,260
You son of a gun.

3147
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:20,380
Okay, anyway.

3148
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:22,400
We'll just take it for now.

3149
02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:24,200
Okay.

3150
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:26,080
Oh, hold on.

3151
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:26,980
My chat is frozen.

3152
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:29,200
One moment, please.

3153
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:32,040
One moment.

3154
02:06:46,570 --> 02:06:48,010
Okay, dokey.

3155
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:49,450
Nice.

3156
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:56,570
Heard about the Gamersupps NSFW.

3157
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:58,170
It's not NSFW!

3158
02:06:59,050 --> 02:07:00,190
It's not!

3159
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:02,450
It's...

3160
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:02,790
What?

3161
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:03,610
Who say...

3162
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:05,350
Who's calling it NSFW?

3163
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:06,910
Huh?

3164
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:09,070
What?

3165
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:09,890
How?

3166
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:10,910
Where?

3167
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:13,930
How?

3168
02:07:14,690 --> 02:07:15,390
How?

3169
02:07:15,690 --> 02:07:16,690
NSFW, how?

3170
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:22,430
Who?

3171
02:07:23,550 --> 02:07:24,450
Who?

3172
02:07:29,010 --> 02:07:31,870
I mean, maybe...

3173
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:33,230
NSFW...

3174
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,890
And yeah, you shouldn't wear it to work.

3175
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:36,030
But like...

3176
02:07:37,890 --> 02:07:40,890
I think that's most anime clothes.

3177
02:07:41,190 --> 02:07:41,330
No.

3178
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:49,390
You can... you can... you can wear it to any anime convention.

3179
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:55,590
It's not... it's not even remotely... it's not even remotely...

3180
02:07:55,590 --> 02:08:04,510
more slightly dangerous than... than the stinking Ahegao shirts that exist out there that people wear on the regular.

3181
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:14,450
But also... if you're so like...

3182
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:16,030
If you're... uh-oh.

3183
02:08:16,170 --> 02:08:17,270
Wait, oh, he doesn't have a baby.

3184
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:21,190
If you're like... I don't know, Minto.

3185
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:24,810
Um, just wear a jacket with it.

3186
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:26,130
Easy peasy.

3187
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:28,990
Hello, polar bear.

3188
02:08:29,690 --> 02:08:30,350
Oh my god.

3189
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,950
Okay, he's over there.

3190
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:33,850
He's not bothering anybody.

3191
02:08:36,630 --> 02:08:37,890
Wear a jacket!

3192
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:41,150
It's... the... the... the... the... freakier side is on the back.

3193
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:44,270
So, you just gotta hide it and you'll be okay.

3194
02:08:45,190 --> 02:08:48,330
I'll probably wear it to any future con I visit.

3195
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:48,810
Yeah!

3196
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:55,420
I'd wear it either way.

3197
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:55,880
See?

3198
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:58,760
It's not so bad.

3199
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:02,260
It's... it's not so bad.

3200
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:04,360
But I'll be honest though.

3201
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,300
When I... you know...

3202
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:09,940
When I got the design, I didn't... think that they were gonna make it into a t-shirt.

3203
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:13,800
So... I wasn't like a...

3204
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:19,210
I... um...

3205
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:23,530
I didn't really think about... the... it would... how it would look on a t-shirt.

3206
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:25,130
The freakier side is on the back.

3207
02:09:25,270 --> 02:09:26,650
We moan about you for ages.

3208
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:34,250
That's a con home shirt for me.

3209
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:35,770
It's really soft though.

3210
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:36,430
That's the thing.

3211
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:38,250
It really is nice to wear at home.

3212
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:40,010
Oh!

3213
02:09:40,230 --> 02:09:40,470
Uh-oh.

3214
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:41,470
It did break the ice.

3215
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:51,690
Oh god.

3216
02:09:52,530 --> 02:09:53,070
Nice.

3217
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:00,700
Nice, nice.

3218
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:01,540
Nice, nice.

3219
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:03,660
Okay.

3220
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:04,300
Nice, nice, nice.

3221
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,180
Now you and...

3222
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:07,640
Finish making my potatoes, please.

3223
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:14,940
Oh man.

3224
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:15,660
No!

3225
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:17,340
No!

3226
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:20,860
Okay.

3227
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:21,200
Alright.

3228
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:21,640
We're fine.

3229
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:22,040
We're fine.

3230
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:24,520
It's melting the ice a little bit, but that's okay.

3231
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:27,120
We're fine.

3232
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:28,200
Everything is okay.

3233
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,740
It's not that spicy.

3234
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:34,860
Oh gosh.

3235
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:35,160
Okay.

3236
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:35,620
Goodbye.

3237
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:36,620
Thank you.

3238
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:37,420
Bye-bye.

3239
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:38,180
Sayonara.

3240
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,480
Oh my gosh.

3241
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:47,000
Can you imagine if I was on top of that?

3242
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:48,000
Alright.

3243
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:49,580
Let's make some more snow.

3244
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:53,220
Very good.

3245
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:55,180
You guys see it up there?

3246
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:57,920
We gotta get even higher.

3247
02:10:58,360 --> 02:10:59,400
Can we get much higher?

3248
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:05,800
Just because you get in trouble for wearing it at work, please.

3249
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:07,500
Yeah!

3250
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:13,370
Alright.

3251
02:11:17,550 --> 02:11:18,030
Alright.

3252
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:19,650
Alright.

3253
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:19,710
Alright.

3254
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:20,330
Soon.

3255
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:20,830
Soon.

3256
02:11:21,150 --> 02:11:21,270
Soon.

3257
02:11:25,270 --> 02:11:27,530
I'm just trying to get up as high as I can.

3258
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:28,150
And then maybe...

3259
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:32,730
Maybe once we get to more...

3260
02:11:32,730 --> 02:11:34,950
Now that I'm out of potatoes...

3261
02:11:34,950 --> 02:11:37,150
We can use the wood for...

3262
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:40,170
This instead.

3263
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:40,690
You know?

3264
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:42,290
For...

3265
02:11:42,290 --> 02:11:43,710
Yeah.

3266
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:45,290
For that.

3267
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:47,190
So we can...

3268
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:49,410
Get even higher.

3269
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:53,930
I'm so happy to talk to you at Sakura-gan.

3270
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:58,110
I'll be wearing my mint hoppy to a big music festival next month to represent my Oshi.

3271
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:00,850
Let's go!

3272
02:12:04,610 --> 02:12:05,890
Thanks, Aardvark!

3273
02:12:07,470 --> 02:12:08,110
Alright.

3274
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:12,970
Okay!

3275
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:14,650
You guys can see it.

3276
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:17,990
Let's make our way over that direction.

3277
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:25,490
Look at our humble beginnings.

3278
02:12:25,930 --> 02:12:27,230
So long ago.

3279
02:12:35,790 --> 02:12:37,390
I think we can get up there.

3280
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:41,270
Hello!

3281
02:12:41,530 --> 02:12:42,170
Excuse me!

3282
02:12:42,590 --> 02:12:43,950
I would like to...

3283
02:12:45,810 --> 02:12:46,410
Um...

3284
02:12:46,410 --> 02:12:48,210
Inquire about your supplies.

3285
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:52,910
What do you have to offer here?

3286
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:56,690
Your...

3287
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:57,050
Your...

3288
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:57,570
Your body!

3289
02:12:58,250 --> 02:12:59,110
Thank you.

3290
02:12:59,290 --> 02:12:59,970
Oh, dang it.

3291
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:00,870
I lost it.

3292
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:01,530
Ha ha ha!

3293
02:13:02,690 --> 02:13:03,230
Ah!

3294
02:13:03,670 --> 02:13:04,910
That's not what I meant to do either.

3295
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:05,990
Sorry.

3296
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:06,890
Um...

3297
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:07,210
Thank you.

3298
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:09,910
Oh, sorry.

3299
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:10,430
Thank you.

3300
02:13:10,790 --> 02:13:11,090
Sorry.

3301
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:11,510
Thank you.

3302
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:13,570
Thank you.

3303
02:13:13,670 --> 02:13:13,910
Thank you.

3304
02:13:14,230 --> 02:13:14,430
Alright.

3305
02:13:14,530 --> 02:13:15,270
We need that wood.

3306
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,130
Mmm...

3307
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:20,930
Mr. Fox.

3308
02:13:23,210 --> 02:13:24,710
Don't do anything drastic.

3309
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:25,730
And...

3310
02:13:25,730 --> 02:13:27,130
There will be no issues.

3311
02:13:27,950 --> 02:13:29,050
They were just chilling.

3312
02:13:29,250 --> 02:13:30,550
Yeah, but I need their...

3313
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:30,810
Body.

3314
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:31,770
I need their...

3315
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:33,110
For the snow.

3316
02:13:33,650 --> 02:13:35,950
The snow is rich in material.

3317
02:13:37,630 --> 02:13:38,150
Ahem.

3318
02:13:42,710 --> 02:13:43,190
Ahem.

3319
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:44,050
Okay.

3320
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:46,050
Oh gosh.

3321
02:13:46,370 --> 02:13:47,650
I can't see anything.

3322
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:48,370
I can't...

3323
02:13:48,370 --> 02:13:49,410
I can't see anything.

3324
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:50,410
There we go.

3325
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:52,950
Okay.

3326
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:57,270
Is Mint also getting her own gamers up flavor?

3327
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:58,890
I think you can only get a flavor...

3328
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:00,130
If you sell enough cups.

3329
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:00,950
Ha ha ha.

3330
02:14:01,790 --> 02:14:03,350
If you sell enough merchandise...

3331
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:06,450
I believe that's how you get the flavor.

3332
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:07,370
Ha ha ha.

3333
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:09,750
So...

3334
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:13,010
As a whisper, I'll probably wear any Minto merch to support my Kavi Yoshi.

3335
02:14:13,090 --> 02:14:14,530
Especially a cute Minky t-shirt.

3336
02:14:15,130 --> 02:14:15,530
For...

3337
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:17,250
I understand though that it could be...

3338
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:17,910
You know...

3339
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:20,030
Way too spicy for some people.

3340
02:14:20,990 --> 02:14:21,430
Um...

3341
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:22,730
I think the...

3342
02:14:23,470 --> 02:14:24,770
I think if anything...

3343
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:26,150
The...

3344
02:14:27,370 --> 02:14:29,170
The cup itself could be okay.

3345
02:14:29,390 --> 02:14:29,630
You know?

3346
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:33,430
But I understand if some people don't want to wear something like that.

3347
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:35,030
So, because of that...

3348
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:37,230
I have been like brainstorming some other...

3349
02:14:38,330 --> 02:14:38,830
Fun...

3350
02:14:38,830 --> 02:14:39,710
Um...

3351
02:14:39,710 --> 02:14:40,530
T-shirt ideas.

3352
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:41,590
Like there's one...

3353
02:14:41,590 --> 02:14:43,070
That I really want to do.

3354
02:14:44,830 --> 02:14:45,330
Uh...

3355
02:14:45,330 --> 02:14:47,190
Which is like...

3356
02:14:47,190 --> 02:14:48,330
How do I say?

3357
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:52,650
It's my style...

3358
02:14:52,650 --> 02:14:53,930
But you wouldn't think it is.

3359
02:14:54,050 --> 02:14:54,390
Is...

3360
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:55,570
I guess how I would say.

3361
02:14:55,850 --> 02:14:56,970
It's kind of hard to describe.

3362
02:14:57,790 --> 02:14:59,430
We could start taking the...

3363
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:01,010
Hold on.

3364
02:15:02,110 --> 02:15:04,010
We could start taking the...

3365
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:06,910
This...

3366
02:15:06,910 --> 02:15:07,210
The...

3367
02:15:07,210 --> 02:15:07,750
Where'd it go?

3368
02:15:07,890 --> 02:15:08,330
Did you...

3369
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:09,110
Did you eat it?

3370
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:10,010
Where is the...

3371
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:10,710
What?

3372
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:11,710
Oh, the dirt!

3373
02:15:11,950 --> 02:15:12,290
There we go.

3374
02:15:12,430 --> 02:15:14,170
And we can start planting trees on it too.

3375
02:15:14,990 --> 02:15:15,830
Just realized.

3376
02:15:20,190 --> 02:15:20,630
Yeah.

3377
02:15:21,190 --> 02:15:22,410
Like IRL style.

3378
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:24,990
It's more of like...

3379
02:15:24,990 --> 02:15:27,190
I don't want to say it so much without giving it away.

3380
02:15:27,330 --> 02:15:29,570
But it's more of like a cooler style.

3381
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:30,490
It's like...

3382
02:15:30,490 --> 02:15:30,790
You know...

3383
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:31,850
I love Moe.

3384
02:15:31,970 --> 02:15:32,630
And I love cute.

3385
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:34,170
But...

3386
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:37,200
Obviously I want to create different styles that...

3387
02:15:37,770 --> 02:15:38,970
Lots of different people.

3388
02:15:39,150 --> 02:15:39,830
Oh my god.

3389
02:15:40,130 --> 02:15:40,510
Oh my god.

3390
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:40,790
I'm...

3391
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:41,430
I'm...

3392
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:41,730
I'm messing up.

3393
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:42,070
I'm...

3394
02:15:42,070 --> 02:15:42,750
I'm ruining it.

3395
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:45,110
That a lot of different people could...

3396
02:15:45,110 --> 02:15:45,850
Enjoy.

3397
02:15:48,410 --> 02:15:48,950
So...

3398
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:52,950
As you said, it's safe for work.

3399
02:15:52,950 --> 02:15:54,710
I'll be wearing it to my government job.

3400
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:55,550
Yeah!

3401
02:15:57,030 --> 02:15:58,510
You show them.

3402
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:00,110
You tell them.

3403
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:02,250
You'll be like...

3404
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:03,230
This is what...

3405
02:16:03,230 --> 02:16:05,450
This is what we should be investing in.

3406
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:09,470
I just realized there was another tree down there.

3407
02:16:09,790 --> 02:16:10,010
Oops.

3408
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:17,190
Hello, hello...

3409
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:18,950
Hello, hello...

3410
02:16:18,950 --> 02:16:20,090
Thank you.

3411
02:16:20,350 --> 02:16:20,730
Sorry.

3412
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:21,590
Hello.

3413
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:22,870
Sorry.

3414
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:23,730
Hello.

3415
02:16:27,290 --> 02:16:27,710
Hello.

3416
02:16:28,150 --> 02:16:28,410
Sorry.

3417
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:29,250
Thank you.

3418
02:16:30,290 --> 02:16:31,610
I must murder.

3419
02:16:31,790 --> 02:16:32,370
I'm sorry.

3420
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:34,050
I must.

3421
02:16:34,190 --> 02:16:34,630
I must.

3422
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:36,410
For the snow.

3423
02:16:43,430 --> 02:16:45,650
Just tell them this is my Oshin no explanation.

3424
02:16:46,910 --> 02:16:47,710
They'll get it.

3425
02:16:47,810 --> 02:16:48,290
They'll understand.

3426
02:16:48,810 --> 02:16:49,550
They'll be like...

3427
02:16:50,730 --> 02:16:54,010
This is what the kids are into.

3428
02:16:54,030 --> 02:16:56,670
This is what we must invest in for the future.

3429
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:04,420
I guess maybe I should leave one alive.

3430
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:08,780
And we can just create infinite snow with the guy.

3431
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:13,180
It's so close, you guys.

3432
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:15,020
Oh my gosh, it's so close.

3433
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:15,900
We're so close.

3434
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,380
It's right there.

3435
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:19,740
It's right there.

3436
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:22,140
Let's go to this island right here.

3437
02:17:30,670 --> 02:17:31,810
Okay, just kidding.

3438
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:34,890
Snow.

3439
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:37,570
We're running out of...

3440
02:17:37,570 --> 02:17:38,070
We're running...

3441
02:17:38,070 --> 02:17:40,530
We're pretty running low on supplies though.

3442
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:43,590
Wow, it's the sun.

3443
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:56,930
Hello.

3444
02:17:57,150 --> 02:17:57,290
Oh.

3445
02:17:58,530 --> 02:17:59,470
Who was that?

3446
02:18:01,130 --> 02:18:02,150
That wasn't me.

3447
02:18:02,990 --> 02:18:04,350
You guys saw that though, right?

3448
02:18:06,050 --> 02:18:06,730
Oh wait.

3449
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:07,470
I'm stupid.

3450
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:08,530
There we go.

3451
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:16,260
Don't look down too much.

3452
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:16,820
I'm getting dizzy.

3453
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:17,680
I have to.

3454
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:19,500
I'm sorry.

3455
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:20,940
I must.

3456
02:18:22,380 --> 02:18:24,000
I wish it wasn't so dark though.

3457
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:24,820
It's so hard to see.

3458
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:30,100
It's so hard to see.

3459
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:33,800
I'm

3460
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:42,280
hearing something about Minto clothing merch.

3461
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:43,000
Maybe.

3462
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,060
Maybe.

3463
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:46,900
Who's spilling the beans?

3464
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,600
Who's spilling the beans?

3465
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:50,880
I get...

3466
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:52,440
I don't know what made me think of this.

3467
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:54,680
I get such random emails.

3468
02:18:55,860 --> 02:18:57,700
Like spam emails.

3469
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:58,740
That are just like...

3470
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:00,860
Oh.

3471
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:01,680
Hi.

3472
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:03,060
Hello fellow...

3473
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:03,160
Um.

3474
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,820
Like recently I've been getting ones that are like...

3475
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:07,900
Um.

3476
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:08,520
Hello.

3477
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:09,980
Fellow diver.

3478
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:11,740
Would you like to...

3479
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:14,000
We would like to sponsor your channel...

3480
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,520
For diving gear.

3481
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:16,480
And I'm like...

3482
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:17,140
What are we...

3483
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:17,740
What?

3484
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,260
I'm a diver now.

3485
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:22,600
Um.

3486
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:24,460
It's pretty funny.

3487
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,540
But I always know when...

3488
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:28,480
Like sometimes...

3489
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:30,380
Spam emails can be pretty convincing.

3490
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:30,740
You know?

3491
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:31,440
Oh my gosh.

3492
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:32,080
Please don't leave.

3493
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:32,740
Don't leave.

3494
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:33,940
Stay with me.

3495
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:34,560
Okay.

3496
02:19:36,040 --> 02:19:36,660
Um...

3497
02:19:36,660 --> 02:19:38,700
Some of them can be pretty convincing.

3498
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,820
But I always know...

3499
02:19:42,820 --> 02:19:44,900
If it's a spam email...

3500
02:19:46,060 --> 02:19:48,340
And if it's trying to be convincing...

3501
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:49,120
Because...

3502
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:49,440
Because...

3503
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:50,720
What it does...

3504
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:52,840
What they do...

3505
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:54,220
Is they'll be like...

3506
02:19:54,220 --> 02:19:54,700
Hello.

3507
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:56,140
Um...

3508
02:19:56,140 --> 02:19:57,160
I'm really into...

3509
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:57,960
Hello Myth Phantom.

3510
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:59,380
I'm really into your content.

3511
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:01,360
Like I've been watching your videos.

3512
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:02,360
And...

3513
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:03,660
When you said weh...

3514
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:04,820
It really moved me.

3515
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:06,360
And when you said...

3516
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:07,540
Pop pop pop pop...

3517
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:09,720
I was just rolling on the floor laughing.

3518
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:10,280
Hahaha.

3519
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,600
Because I have videos...

3520
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:18,700
Because I have the videos that are just like...

3521
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:20,640
VTuber says pop pop pop pop...

3522
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:22,320
And they always...

3523
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,980
Reference that one...

3524
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:25,600
For some reason.

3525
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:27,400
Hahaha.

3526
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:30,600
They're always just like...

3527
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:30,820
Yeah.

3528
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:32,520
We loved when you said...

3529
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:33,480
Pop pop pop pop.

3530
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:34,300
Hahaha.

3531
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:35,520
I don't understand.

3532
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:37,320
Hahaha.

3533
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:40,160
I guess because they don't look at...

3534
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:41,080
Live streams...

3535
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:42,120
They look at like...

3536
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,960
My actual uploaded videos.

3537
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,060
Which I don't have...

3538
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:46,220
Very many of at all.

3539
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,600
The receptionist said...

3540
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:49,480
This one government building...

3541
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:50,340
I used to go to...

3542
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:51,480
Covered the entire reception desk...

3543
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,340
In toy shoes.

3544
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:53,600
Oh.

3545
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:54,060
Neat.

3546
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:55,900
When you said weh...

3547
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:57,020
It really moved me.

3548
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:57,700
Hahaha.

3549
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:00,500
Hahaha.

3550
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:00,560
Yeah.

3551
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:02,260
So you know...

3552
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:03,900
My pop pop pop pop video...

3553
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:05,660
Is pop pop poppin' off baby.

3554
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:06,320
Hahaha.

3555
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:08,280
Hahaha.

3556
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:14,880
That's so close.

3557
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:16,440
That's so close.

3558
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:17,420
Let's...

3559
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:18,040
Let's go out.

3560
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:18,960
Some.

3561
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:24,960
Did you guys watch way three?

3562
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:31,250
I sure hope you did.

3563
02:21:31,910 --> 02:21:32,250
Nice.

3564
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:33,350
There's another...

3565
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:34,410
Uh...

3566
02:21:35,050 --> 02:21:35,650
Another...

3567
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:41,860
Uh...

3568
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:42,140
Tree.

3569
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:43,400
That's what I'm trying to say.

3570
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:44,280
Of like words.

3571
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:46,080
Words escape me.

3572
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:47,920
Excuse me.

3573
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:50,980
We're so...

3574
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:51,520
Close.

3575
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:53,680
We feel...

3576
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:54,820
I feel so close.

3577
02:21:55,960 --> 02:21:56,040
Ah.

3578
02:22:00,710 --> 02:22:01,150
Wisps.

3579
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:02,210
How many have you watched...

3580
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:03,610
Way three multiple times...

3581
02:22:03,610 --> 02:22:04,230
In the past day?

3582
02:22:04,590 --> 02:22:04,990
Yeah.

3583
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:06,510
How many?

3584
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:13,140
My wallpaper.

3585
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,820
How did you make your wallpaper...

3586
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:15,540
From way three?

3587
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:18,640
Four times.

3588
02:22:18,820 --> 02:22:19,060
Yes.

3589
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:19,860
Hahaha.

3590
02:22:22,580 --> 02:22:23,180
Kanye.

3591
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:25,060
Makes for the super jet.

3592
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:27,500
50 times?

3593
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:28,060
Okay.

3594
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:30,540
Very nice.

3595
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,220
Did it move you?

3596
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:35,840
Pop...

3597
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:38,020
Maybe I should make a sequel to Pop Pop Pop Pop.

3598
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:39,800
So that they have more...

3599
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:42,340
Material that the spam emails can use.

3600
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:44,380
Hahaha.

3601
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:45,640
Maybe I need to upload more videos.

3602
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:50,980
I'm going to have one this week to upload.

3603
02:23:06,190 --> 02:23:06,510
Snow.

3604
02:23:06,930 --> 02:23:08,270
I think I'm going to get rid of...

3605
02:23:08,270 --> 02:23:08,850
Get rid of...

3606
02:23:08,850 --> 02:23:09,190
Oh!

3607
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:10,770
I just realized I have a cooked salmon.

3608
02:23:12,010 --> 02:23:12,730
Let's eat that.

3609
02:23:13,030 --> 02:23:14,470
I didn't realize I had cooked food.

3610
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:15,870
Nice.

3611
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:16,630
All right.

3612
02:23:18,270 --> 02:23:19,610
Let's get rid of...

3613
02:23:19,610 --> 02:23:19,890
String.

3614
02:23:20,290 --> 02:23:20,990
And the stick.

3615
02:23:22,470 --> 02:23:22,770
Okay.

3616
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:23,610
Oh!

3617
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:25,150
I just realized I have a lot more slabs.

3618
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:25,450
Nice.

3619
02:23:25,550 --> 02:23:25,630
Nice.

3620
02:23:25,750 --> 02:23:25,810
Nice.

3621
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:26,150
Okay.

3622
02:23:26,450 --> 02:23:26,670
Okay.

3623
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:26,870
Good.

3624
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:27,010
Good.

3625
02:23:27,150 --> 02:23:27,170
Good.

3626
02:23:28,270 --> 02:23:28,570
Good.

3627
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:28,770
Good.

3628
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:30,510
You guys, we're going to make it.

3629
02:23:30,590 --> 02:23:31,510
We're going to make it!

3630
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:36,790
Boss, the Minto socks to make the ultimate Minto travel fit.

3631
02:23:36,950 --> 02:23:38,490
Think of the socks and sandals.

3632
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:40,150
Also, Wisp plush win.

3633
02:23:41,710 --> 02:23:42,330
Um...

3634
02:23:43,310 --> 02:23:45,750
Well, I did have sandals with the...

3635
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:46,850
With the...

3636
02:23:46,850 --> 02:23:47,630
With the podcast.

3637
02:23:48,250 --> 02:23:49,650
So I wasn't...

3638
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:50,950
Thinking about...

3639
02:23:50,950 --> 02:23:53,130
Making any more anytime soon.

3640
02:23:53,150 --> 02:23:54,890
I was like...

3641
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:55,890
I...

3642
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:56,430
You know...

3643
02:23:56,430 --> 02:23:57,470
That was only last year.

3644
02:23:58,190 --> 02:24:00,790
So it feels fairly recent, you know?

3645
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:03,930
But...

3646
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:05,710
Maybe...

3647
02:24:05,710 --> 02:24:06,790
Maybe more.

3648
02:24:07,330 --> 02:24:08,410
Minto official socks.

3649
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:11,230
Actually, someone gifted me some...

3650
02:24:11,230 --> 02:24:12,870
What's the word?

3651
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:16,110
Some...

3652
02:24:17,750 --> 02:24:19,630
Some, like, Wisp socks.

3653
02:24:20,110 --> 02:24:22,130
And I don't wear them out, obviously.

3654
02:24:22,130 --> 02:24:22,870
But I do...

3655
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:24,450
Wear them at home.

3656
02:24:26,330 --> 02:24:28,750
I even wore them yesterday.

3657
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:33,110
You guys are on my mind...

3658
02:24:33,110 --> 02:24:33,930
And on my feet.

3659
02:24:40,570 --> 02:24:41,110
All right.

3660
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:42,870
Create more snow for me, please.

3661
02:24:47,350 --> 02:24:48,630
Yeah, you're doing such a good job.

3662
02:24:48,890 --> 02:24:49,930
You're doing great, sweetie.

3663
02:24:50,350 --> 02:24:51,370
You're doing great, sweetie.

3664
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:53,170
You're doing great, sweetie.

3665
02:24:54,670 --> 02:24:55,110
No!

3666
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:00,250
Maybe I can trap them.

3667
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:08,140
Okay.

3668
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,220
Now, how do I collect the snow?

3669
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:18,520
No!

3670
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:20,660
I didn't trap them good enough.

3671
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,560
I messed up.

3672
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:27,020
Oh!

3673
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:28,200
Please don't push me.

3674
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:29,320
Please don't push me.

3675
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:30,100
Please!

3676
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:32,260
I know I murdered your brethren, but...

3677
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,480
How do we want to do this, guys?

3678
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:47,200
How would you do it?

3679
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:50,900
Oh...

3680
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,360
That was a good amount of snow, though.

3681
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:57,920
Would you say you step on us when you wear the Wisp socks?

3682
02:26:03,860 --> 02:26:04,300
Yeah.

3683
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:05,140
Yeah.

3684
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:06,640
No, no, no, no.

3685
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:07,640
Actually...

3686
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:09,260
You stay, like...

3687
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:12,740
Right where you are.

3688
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:14,060
No,

3689
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:17,430
no.

3690
02:26:17,870 --> 02:26:18,230
Please.

3691
02:26:18,470 --> 02:26:20,030
Please come inwards a little bit.

3692
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:21,570
Inwards.

3693
02:26:23,370 --> 02:26:23,770
In...

3694
02:26:23,770 --> 02:26:24,250
In...

3695
02:26:24,250 --> 02:26:24,330
Inwards.

3696
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:25,210
Don't look at me.

3697
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:27,350
Please, I'm not gonna kill you!

3698
02:26:27,370 --> 02:26:27,950
I promise.

3699
02:26:30,030 --> 02:26:30,230
No.

3700
02:26:39,870 --> 02:26:41,690
These guys are ruining my vibes.

3701
02:26:46,270 --> 02:26:49,050
I like how they give you diamond gear, because they're just like...

3702
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:49,350
You...

3703
02:26:49,350 --> 02:26:50,970
You would have to really mess up.

3704
02:26:52,650 --> 02:26:53,010
To...

3705
02:26:53,630 --> 02:26:53,990
To...

3706
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:54,450
Um...

3707
02:26:54,990 --> 02:26:56,110
Not be able to make it.

3708
02:26:56,210 --> 02:26:56,430
You know?

3709
02:26:56,690 --> 02:26:57,910
I feel like I could.

3710
02:26:59,270 --> 02:27:00,910
I feel like we can at this point.

3711
02:27:01,010 --> 02:27:01,190
No?

3712
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:02,430
I don't.

3713
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:06,770
I feel like we can make it.

3714
02:27:09,450 --> 02:27:10,250
Let's try it.

3715
02:27:10,370 --> 02:27:11,290
I think you can just go for it.

3716
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:11,870
I think so, too.

3717
02:27:12,710 --> 02:27:14,390
Okay, what I'm gonna do is go up here.

3718
02:27:14,850 --> 02:27:16,050
So we're a little bit higher.

3719
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:18,330
And then we're gonna use the slabs to go...

3720
02:27:19,830 --> 02:27:20,550
Long distance.

3721
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,380
But what if...

3722
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:33,700
I don't have enough to get to the top?

3723
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:36,060
What if...

3724
02:27:41,170 --> 02:27:43,270
All right, all right, all right, all right.

3725
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:46,950
We...

3726
02:27:50,250 --> 02:27:52,030
I have 32 and 20...

3727
02:27:52,030 --> 02:27:52,730
Oh, I have 64.

3728
02:27:52,910 --> 02:27:53,490
Oh, we're so good.

3729
02:27:53,630 --> 02:27:53,930
Never mind.

3730
02:27:54,150 --> 02:27:54,790
We're fine.

3731
02:27:55,830 --> 02:27:56,570
We're fine.

3732
02:27:56,690 --> 02:27:57,010
We're fine.

3733
02:27:57,170 --> 02:27:57,490
We're fine.

3734
02:27:58,750 --> 02:27:59,670
We'll make it.

3735
02:28:01,650 --> 02:28:02,810
Oh, we are so good.

3736
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,710
Oh!

3737
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:08,170
We...

3738
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:09,090
We've got this.

3739
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:09,990
Easy peasy.

3740
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:11,030
Lemon squeezy.

3741
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:13,590
Wait.

3742
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:16,890
32, 64.

3743
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:18,170
Let's use this instead.

3744
02:28:19,410 --> 02:28:21,030
Easy peasy.

3745
02:28:23,490 --> 02:28:23,930
Oh!

3746
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:24,750
Oh!

3747
02:28:27,450 --> 02:28:29,130
Give me my key!

3748
02:28:33,310 --> 02:28:34,190
Yeah!

3749
02:28:43,180 --> 02:28:43,620
Yahoo!

3750
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:45,500
Where's my key?

3751
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:46,760
I didn't get one.

3752
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:47,220
No way!

3753
02:28:47,380 --> 02:28:47,600
Oh!

3754
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:48,400
I did get one!

3755
02:28:48,980 --> 02:28:49,620
Yes!

3756
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:50,560
Yes!

3757
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:52,180
Yes!

3758
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:53,720
Yes!

3759
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:54,080
Yes!

3760
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:57,720
Let's go put our world away.

3761
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,900
It's a spooky looking key.

3762
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:03,820
All right.

3763
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:05,500
Shimmering key.

3764
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:09,000
We have...

3765
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:12,580
Opened the door.

3766
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:13,460
This one.

3767
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:16,240
And it led to other doors.

3768
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:17,840
Like this one and this one!

3769
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:24,540
Something wrong.

3770
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:26,220
What do you mean something wrong?

3771
02:29:36,610 --> 02:29:37,770
What about down here?

3772
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:39,930
Oh.

3773
02:29:40,410 --> 02:29:40,710
Hall?

3774
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:46,790
Door.

3775
02:29:47,190 --> 02:29:48,430
Door you just clicked.

3776
02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:51,190
It's showing me that it like...

3777
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:52,630
Opens other room...

3778
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:53,550
Oh my god.

3779
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:54,770
That scared me so bad.

3780
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:56,970
I thought I was about to die, you guys.

3781
02:29:57,250 --> 02:29:59,070
I thought I was about to die for real!

3782
02:30:00,770 --> 02:30:01,650
Something wrong.

3783
02:30:03,610 --> 02:30:04,070
Wait.

3784
02:30:04,230 --> 02:30:05,410
So this is just going to open...

3785
02:30:05,410 --> 02:30:06,350
Something wrong here too.

3786
02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:09,730
This is just going to open another room with doors.

3787
02:30:11,270 --> 02:30:11,710
See?

3788
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:12,610
Wall, door.

3789
02:30:12,850 --> 02:30:14,110
There's just more rooms!

3790
02:30:14,390 --> 02:30:15,310
What about...

3791
02:30:17,310 --> 02:30:18,450
I mean there's other...

3792
02:30:18,450 --> 02:30:19,170
These doors...

3793
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:19,390
Oh.

3794
02:30:19,770 --> 02:30:20,830
I forgot something.

3795
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:22,730
There's this one over here as well.

3796
02:30:24,130 --> 02:30:26,930
But it's also just going to...

3797
02:30:29,350 --> 02:30:31,450
I missed the sock discussion.

3798
02:30:31,870 --> 02:30:33,130
Did Mito socks get announced?

3799
02:30:33,270 --> 02:30:33,610
No!

3800
02:30:34,590 --> 02:30:35,810
I was saying...

3801
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:35,970
Why?

3802
02:30:36,070 --> 02:30:37,310
Do you guys want socks that badly?

3803
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:40,630
You guys want socks that badly?

3804
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:43,850
Key has a specific room.

3805
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:45,430
Opens useless room.

3806
02:30:45,430 --> 02:30:47,530
Ahhhh...

3807
02:30:47,530 --> 02:30:47,850
No!

3808
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:51,710
So this is not...

3809
02:30:51,710 --> 02:30:53,430
A useless...

3810
02:30:53,430 --> 02:30:55,630
This is like a useless room.

3811
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:01,040
Whoa!

3812
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:04,140
Interesting.

3813
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:08,400
Let me out, please.

3814
02:31:12,990 --> 02:31:14,110
Mintoes.

3815
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:17,070
Alright.

3816
02:31:17,730 --> 02:31:19,410
What we wanted to do...

3817
02:31:20,410 --> 02:31:22,990
I don't want zombies, but I want it.

3818
02:31:23,110 --> 02:31:24,190
Wow, look at all this stuff we want.

3819
02:31:24,430 --> 02:31:24,830
TNT.

3820
02:31:27,630 --> 02:31:28,430
Shut up.

3821
02:31:28,670 --> 02:31:30,670
Let's make like the most dangerous, scary world.

3822
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:32,770
Wait, we are in the deep dark.

3823
02:31:34,010 --> 02:31:39,230
Okay, we got skellies, we've got zombies, we've got guardians.

3824
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:45,770
Let's make the most horrifying, terrible thing ever.

3825
02:31:47,170 --> 02:31:48,570
I need... we got sheep.

3826
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:52,650
Wait, actually...

3827
02:31:55,570 --> 02:31:59,730
Wait, didn't I unlock a mooshroom biome?

3828
02:31:59,930 --> 02:32:00,910
I guess we can't use it.

3829
02:32:01,930 --> 02:32:02,710
That sucks.

3830
02:32:02,890 --> 02:32:03,650
Oh wait, there it is.

3831
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:05,550
This way.

3832
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:12,530
But before I do this, let's use our levels.

3833
02:32:15,590 --> 02:32:16,030
Fourteen.

3834
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:18,190
Nice.

3835
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:21,650
If I lose six levels...

3836
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:25,710
That's fine, maybe.

3837
02:32:27,590 --> 02:32:28,570
Or we'll do that one.

3838
02:32:28,770 --> 02:32:29,110
There we go.

3839
02:32:29,270 --> 02:32:29,490
Nice.

3840
02:32:29,630 --> 02:32:29,750
Okay.

3841
02:32:31,390 --> 02:32:32,070
Let's go.

3842
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:34,290
It probably wouldn't fit me.

3843
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:34,890
What are you saying?

3844
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:36,330
You got big old feet, yeah?

3845
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:52,220
Once again, we are in...

3846
02:32:52,220 --> 02:32:53,940
We are in Lush Biome Takeover.

3847
02:32:58,450 --> 02:32:59,230
Lush Biome?

3848
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:01,330
Why is the Lush Biome Takeover so much?

3849
02:33:01,330 --> 02:33:02,440
It's like in a...

3850
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:08,090
It was the...

3851
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:09,210
That was the exit!

3852
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:12,950
The exit was right next to me!

3853
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:14,330
No!

3854
02:33:25,770 --> 02:33:27,150
Wait, can I go back in?

3855
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:30,290
Revisiting an old one that was lost.

3856
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:30,710
Look!

3857
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:32,890
It's right next to me!

3858
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:38,690
I just turned the wrong way!

3859
02:33:39,790 --> 02:33:41,050
Aw, man.

3860
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:45,930
That's so sad.

3861
02:33:46,430 --> 02:33:47,150
Oh, another one.

3862
02:33:48,730 --> 02:33:49,610
Holy cow.

3863
02:33:50,290 --> 02:33:50,990
Oh my god.

3864
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:52,950
I thought it was a creeper at first.

3865
02:33:54,550 --> 02:33:56,530
How am I activating these traps?

3866
02:33:56,630 --> 02:33:57,350
I don't understand.

3867
02:33:58,430 --> 02:33:59,510
Are they...

3868
02:34:00,190 --> 02:34:01,930
Am I like clicking on something?

3869
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:03,050
Wait, what's that?

3870
02:34:04,110 --> 02:34:05,430
Oh no, that's just some seeds.

3871
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:11,900
Random TNT spawning.

3872
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:13,040
That's so messed up.

3873
02:34:14,260 --> 02:34:15,200
Okay, let's try.

3874
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:16,200
Let's do Mu.

3875
02:34:16,540 --> 02:34:17,080
Mu.

3876
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:18,880
Deep Dark.

3877
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:20,320
I want to find the Deep Dark.

3878
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:22,540
Oh, we got Guardians.

3879
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:23,120
Okay.

3880
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:24,320
Mushrooms.

3881
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:26,900
What else we have?

3882
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:28,380
Andesite Savannah.

3883
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:36,340
This is...

3884
02:34:36,900 --> 02:34:37,380
Freaky.

3885
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:41,320
We would've gotten 1.5 XP.

3886
02:34:41,660 --> 02:34:43,760
Because the exit was right next to us.

3887
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:44,720
It's so messed up.

3888
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:49,420
We would've had 1.5 XP.

3889
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:00,760
It is once again!

3890
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:01,500
Oh my god.

3891
02:35:04,180 --> 02:35:05,000
We need to go.

3892
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:05,700
We need to leave.

3893
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:06,380
We need to leave.

3894
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:08,380
We need to leave.

3895
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:08,880
We need to leave.

3896
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:09,620
We need to leave.

3897
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:10,160
We need to leave.

3898
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:11,460
We need to leave.

3899
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:12,380
Please.

3900
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:13,260
Give me out.

3901
02:35:13,400 --> 02:35:13,840
Give me out.

3902
02:35:17,960 --> 02:35:18,660
Just run!

3903
02:35:23,890 --> 02:35:25,210
I got another key.

3904
02:35:28,030 --> 02:35:28,430
Junction.

3905
02:35:31,170 --> 02:35:31,730
Junction.

3906
02:35:31,730 --> 02:35:33,130
That was terrifying.

3907
02:35:33,450 --> 02:35:33,530
Yeah.

3908
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:36,390
I didn't think the Guardians would be in all the water.

3909
02:35:39,050 --> 02:35:41,250
I didn't think it would be in everywhere.

3910
02:35:43,050 --> 02:35:43,610
No.

3911
02:35:44,630 --> 02:35:45,190
Junction.

3912
02:35:45,710 --> 02:35:47,450
What was another sad face that we got?

3913
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:54,670
Oh!

3914
02:35:57,330 --> 02:35:57,750
Oh!

3915
02:35:59,370 --> 02:36:00,890
Wait, we can get stuff in here even?

3916
02:36:02,010 --> 02:36:03,550
We can start collecting...

3917
02:36:03,550 --> 02:36:03,910
What?

3918
02:36:05,490 --> 02:36:05,910
What?

3919
02:36:12,230 --> 02:36:13,730
What am I supposed to do with this stuff?

3920
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:15,250
This place is wacky.

3921
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:15,910
I know!

3922
02:36:17,170 --> 02:36:17,590
What?

3923
02:36:22,980 --> 02:36:24,160
I think I saw another...

3924
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:25,060
Yeah, there's a door here too.

3925
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:28,020
Did

3926
02:36:32,460 --> 02:36:33,440
I get all my XP?

3927
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:39,270
Why are we allowed...

3928
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:40,350
How can we farm?

3929
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:45,880
I wonder.

3930
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:46,220
Hold on.

3931
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:47,860
I wanna see with the old worlds.

3932
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:52,750
So, okay.

3933
02:36:54,470 --> 02:36:56,830
Wait, there was two of them right next to each other.

3934
02:36:57,090 --> 02:36:57,490
Three!

3935
02:36:58,250 --> 02:37:00,390
Wow, we've never been so lucky before, you guys.

3936
02:37:00,390 --> 02:37:01,610
Look how many exits there are.

3937
02:37:01,710 --> 02:37:02,770
Just within like a...

3938
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:05,870
I was wondering if you like can go into creative mode.

3939
02:37:06,170 --> 02:37:06,690
Nah.

3940
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:08,730
But...

3941
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:09,470
Clearly not.

3942
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:10,850
Clearly we would just die.

3943
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:12,590
There's another one over there too!

3944
02:37:13,150 --> 02:37:13,750
Ouch.

3945
02:37:16,830 --> 02:37:17,430
Interesting.

3946
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:18,710
Crazy spawn.

3947
02:37:19,030 --> 02:37:19,170
Yeah.

3948
02:37:19,890 --> 02:37:20,910
We're gonna die.

3949
02:37:21,210 --> 02:37:21,350
Ouch.

3950
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:25,170
Okay.

3951
02:37:28,690 --> 02:37:30,730
I think you get put in adventure mode.

3952
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:31,710
That's terrible.

3953
02:37:33,850 --> 02:37:35,910
Someone just has spawned with a ton of exits.

3954
02:37:37,450 --> 02:37:37,930
Crazy.

3955
02:37:41,370 --> 02:37:42,570
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

3956
02:37:44,590 --> 02:37:46,170
Look at all the things we still haven't...

3957
02:37:46,170 --> 02:37:46,510
Actually!

3958
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:48,510
The things that we haven't undiscovered yet.

3959
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:50,970
Eat some bamboo.

3960
02:37:52,150 --> 02:37:53,150
Maybe not me.

3961
02:37:56,330 --> 02:37:56,810
Um...

3962
02:37:56,810 --> 02:37:58,890
Win a mind that never sees the light of day.

3963
02:37:59,490 --> 02:38:00,750
Wait, I did that though!

3964
02:38:00,750 --> 02:38:01,750
The one that was...

3965
02:38:05,010 --> 02:38:05,530
Wow!

3966
02:38:05,890 --> 02:38:06,750
Five times!

3967
02:38:08,070 --> 02:38:10,050
Probably dried out among fossils.

3968
02:38:15,390 --> 02:38:16,830
Buy from a villager?

3969
02:38:18,270 --> 02:38:19,990
We haven't even gotten villagers.

3970
02:38:20,230 --> 02:38:21,790
But there's actually not so much...

3971
02:38:21,790 --> 02:38:23,370
Like it used to be really, really long.

3972
02:38:24,750 --> 02:38:26,890
Of things that we haven't discovered yet.

3973
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:27,690
But now it's...

3974
02:38:27,690 --> 02:38:28,870
It's...

3975
02:38:28,870 --> 02:38:29,930
Very...

3976
02:38:29,930 --> 02:38:30,410
It's...

3977
02:38:30,410 --> 02:38:33,250
Gradually getting smaller and smaller.

3978
02:38:34,070 --> 02:38:35,570
They really cooked with this update.

3979
02:38:35,690 --> 02:38:36,470
They did!

3980
02:38:37,650 --> 02:38:40,470
Waterworld plus fish out of water is a broken combo.

3981
02:38:40,470 --> 02:38:40,950
So...

3982
02:38:42,490 --> 02:38:43,450
Let's see...

3983
02:38:43,450 --> 02:38:46,490
We haven't done a cave exit, but...

3984
02:38:46,490 --> 02:38:47,470
I don't think I can...

3985
02:38:47,470 --> 02:38:47,690
Yeah...

3986
02:38:47,690 --> 02:38:47,970
Oh wait!

3987
02:38:48,190 --> 02:38:49,990
The next one is a cave exit!

3988
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:50,910
Oh no!

3989
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:52,630
Well, we'll just go into a cave.

3990
02:38:52,630 --> 02:38:52,890
Very fun.

3991
02:38:54,370 --> 02:38:55,650
And let's do...

3992
02:38:57,190 --> 02:38:58,330
Deep dark.

3993
02:38:58,750 --> 02:39:00,370
We got chickens for food.

3994
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:06,150
Let's do...

3995
02:39:11,970 --> 02:39:14,490
Mushroom islands, except not only islands.

3996
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:16,990
I wanna still try and find a mushroom biome.

3997
02:39:17,090 --> 02:39:17,910
I think that would be fun.

3998
02:39:20,250 --> 02:39:21,890
Deep dark mushroom...

3999
02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:22,790
Cave world.

4000
02:39:24,370 --> 02:39:26,090
Cave mushroom biome?

4001
02:39:26,230 --> 02:39:27,070
Seems crazy, no?

4002
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:28,590
Oh, the Wednesday!

4003
02:39:29,130 --> 02:39:29,730
Wait...

4004
02:39:29,730 --> 02:39:31,430
I forgot about the Wednesday frogs.

4005
02:39:36,990 --> 02:39:39,070
For some reason I have so much sugar can.

4006
02:39:42,530 --> 02:39:43,670
Are we in a cave?

4007
02:39:45,670 --> 02:39:46,270
Uh...

4008
02:39:46,270 --> 02:39:46,850
Oh...

4009
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:47,390
Oh...

4010
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:48,150
Oh...

4011
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:51,150
Oh!

4012
02:39:51,330 --> 02:39:52,670
There's so many Zombos!

4013
02:39:53,910 --> 02:39:54,710
Uh...

4014
02:39:55,550 --> 02:39:57,230
I think we are...

4015
02:39:57,530 --> 02:39:58,490
In a...

4016
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:59,510
Cave...

4017
02:39:59,510 --> 02:40:00,270
Ish?

4018
02:40:00,970 --> 02:40:02,390
What the hell?

4019
02:40:02,730 --> 02:40:04,070
Is that water down there?

4020
02:40:05,890 --> 02:40:07,370
I see the exit!

4021
02:40:10,470 --> 02:40:12,050
What is this?

4022
02:40:15,670 --> 02:40:16,670
Hello, Zombo!

4023
02:40:16,670 --> 02:40:18,670
I still can't use my shield properly...

4024
02:40:19,190 --> 02:40:19,370
Which...

4025
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:19,930
Oh, there's another!

4026
02:40:20,110 --> 02:40:21,310
Oh wow, there's a bunch of exits again!

4027
02:40:22,050 --> 02:40:22,470
Let's go!

4028
02:40:25,310 --> 02:40:26,230
Where did you come from?

4029
02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:34,870
We once again...

4030
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:36,050
Got a really lucky spawn.

4031
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:40,290
Which one do we wanna go to?

4032
02:40:44,270 --> 02:40:45,570
I'm trying to...

4033
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:47,630
I want to explore but...

4034
02:40:48,290 --> 02:40:49,450
I guess we can...

4035
02:40:51,310 --> 02:40:52,530
This is so strange...

4036
02:40:53,790 --> 02:40:54,570
It's like...

4037
02:40:54,570 --> 02:40:56,190
I can't tell if we're in a cave or not...

4038
02:40:56,190 --> 02:40:57,630
Because it's so bright...

4039
02:40:57,630 --> 02:40:57,950
You know?

4040
02:40:59,030 --> 02:41:00,530
It's not dark at all...

4041
02:41:03,450 --> 02:41:05,530
There's so many next to each other...

4042
02:41:06,390 --> 02:41:07,610
There's one over...

4043
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:07,770
Oh!

4044
02:41:08,010 --> 02:41:08,370
Hello!

4045
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:15,220
Oh my gosh!

4046
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,820
They're all gonna become drowned!

4047
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,140
Oh my gosh!

4048
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:25,880
They're all gonna become drowned!

4049
02:41:31,330 --> 02:41:32,050
Oops!

4050
02:41:32,050 --> 02:41:32,150
Oops!

4051
02:41:33,790 --> 02:41:35,270
There goes my...

4052
02:41:35,270 --> 02:41:37,970
Wait, but it's so far down...

4053
02:41:37,970 --> 02:41:38,460
The...

4054
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:40,180
Huh...

4055
02:41:40,670 --> 02:41:42,230
This is so strange!

4056
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:44,410
It's raining zombies!

4057
02:41:45,610 --> 02:41:48,010
There's so many zombies here!

4058
02:41:49,570 --> 02:41:50,450
Tweet tweet!

4059
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:52,730
Is this lava?

4060
02:41:52,910 --> 02:41:53,330
What the?

4061
02:41:56,030 --> 02:41:56,710
The...

4062
02:41:56,710 --> 02:41:58,830
The lava is waterlogged?

4063
02:41:58,970 --> 02:41:59,330
Whoa!

4064
02:42:04,930 --> 02:42:06,110
There we go, baby!

4065
02:42:06,710 --> 02:42:07,390
Now we'll never...

4066
02:42:12,390 --> 02:42:13,930
Water in the fire!

4067
02:42:14,130 --> 02:42:14,470
Why?

4068
02:42:15,190 --> 02:42:15,730
How?

4069
02:42:18,130 --> 02:42:19,570
Water in the fire...

4070
02:42:19,570 --> 02:42:19,890
Why?

4071
02:42:21,430 --> 02:42:22,910
I wonder if you could like...

4072
02:42:22,910 --> 02:42:23,770
Fall out of the map...

4073
02:42:23,770 --> 02:42:24,510
In this one, you know?

4074
02:42:28,070 --> 02:42:28,930
Wait, I got...

4075
02:42:29,470 --> 02:42:30,190
Magma cubes!

4076
02:42:31,010 --> 02:42:32,150
I must have gotten that...

4077
02:42:32,150 --> 02:42:33,210
For mining the magma!

4078
02:42:33,330 --> 02:42:33,910
That's awesome!

4079
02:42:34,750 --> 02:42:35,430
The magma...

4080
02:42:35,430 --> 02:42:36,190
Why did I say it like that?

4081
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:40,150
Please...

4082
02:42:40,150 --> 02:42:40,750
Grab it, thank you!

4083
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:42,330
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

4084
02:42:43,130 --> 02:42:43,850
I wonder...

4085
02:42:43,850 --> 02:42:44,310
Wait...

4086
02:42:44,310 --> 02:42:45,670
Can I mine the obsidian?

4087
02:42:46,350 --> 02:42:47,970
Let's try it...

4088
02:42:47,970 --> 02:42:48,970
The magma...

4089
02:42:50,650 --> 02:42:51,770
Get magma...

4090
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:52,050
Get magma...

4091
02:42:57,270 --> 02:42:59,090
Oh, I do need diamond, you're right...

4092
02:42:59,090 --> 02:43:00,610
I'm sorry, I forgot...

4093
02:43:02,270 --> 02:43:03,390
Completely forgot...

4094
02:43:03,390 --> 02:43:03,950
This is...

4095
02:43:03,950 --> 02:43:04,450
I don't...

4096
02:43:04,450 --> 02:43:06,590
I don't know why we're in a cave world...

4097
02:43:06,590 --> 02:43:08,350
That is also like so...

4098
02:43:08,350 --> 02:43:09,390
Filled with water...

4099
02:43:11,490 --> 02:43:13,250
That's what's confusing me if...

4100
02:43:13,250 --> 02:43:13,490
Oh...

4101
02:43:13,490 --> 02:43:14,390
No, no, no, no, no, no...

4102
02:43:17,890 --> 02:43:18,770
Glow squids!

4103
02:43:19,630 --> 02:43:20,970
This is so weird...

4104
02:43:21,510 --> 02:43:22,730
This is so weird!

4105
02:43:23,030 --> 02:43:24,830
Sorry, I know I keep saying how weird it is...

4106
02:43:24,830 --> 02:43:26,590
But it's actually just so weird!

4107
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:31,390
Maybe glow squids gives us something too...

4108
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:32,270
Like, look at this!

4109
02:43:33,690 --> 02:43:35,170
I've never seen...

4110
02:43:35,530 --> 02:43:37,770
It's very cool and very weird...

4111
02:43:38,590 --> 02:43:39,910
Will we reach the bottom?

4112
02:43:42,110 --> 02:43:42,510
Go,

4113
02:43:46,100 --> 02:43:47,920
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go...

4114
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:48,560
Nice!

4115
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:51,160
Holy cow...

4116
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:52,540
Almost didn't make that...

4117
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:58,520
It's about that diving sponsorship...

4118
02:43:58,520 --> 02:43:59,040
Please!

4119
02:44:01,440 --> 02:44:03,860
I did get something new...

4120
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:05,020
You know what?

4121
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:06,400
I'm just gonna go to this one over here...

4122
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:08,600
There...

4123
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:10,000
This exit...

4124
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,320
We'll just stick around over here...

4125
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:11,560
You know?

4126
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:14,580
I wish I could get...

4127
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:15,400
Ouchy, ouchy...

4128
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:16,700
Some armor...

4129
02:44:16,700 --> 02:44:17,440
Oh, yeah...

4130
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:19,360
Nope!

4131
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:23,190
Oh, gosh...

4132
02:44:23,190 --> 02:44:23,690
Oh...

4133
02:44:25,770 --> 02:44:26,650
My Mogba!

4134
02:44:27,110 --> 02:44:27,810
Oh...

4135
02:44:29,830 --> 02:44:30,990
That was close...

4136
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:37,320
Saw the designs for your Gamersubs merch...

4137
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:38,320
I think it's all super cute...

4138
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:40,060
I love the Metal Gear reference on the cup and shirt...

4139
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:42,240
I also love the cute skateboarding Minto design...

4140
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:43,540
Thank you, Dreadnought!

4141
02:44:43,740 --> 02:44:44,360
Thank you!

4142
02:44:45,380 --> 02:44:46,600
Glad you like it!

4143
02:44:52,730 --> 02:44:53,930
Oh, this is lava!

4144
02:44:54,310 --> 02:44:55,530
Oh my God, it's so weird!

4145
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:04,520
Okay...

4146
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:06,940
Um...

4147
02:45:11,860 --> 02:45:12,580
It's waterlogged...

4148
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:14,260
Magma...

4149
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:15,940
Magma...

4150
02:45:17,100 --> 02:45:17,460
Pew!

4151
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:19,620
Man, what else can we get?

4152
02:45:19,740 --> 02:45:21,200
Hold on, let me look at my inventory...

4153
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:21,480
I don't...

4154
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:23,040
I feel like I have nothing...

4155
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:23,560
You know?

4156
02:45:23,820 --> 02:45:24,740
I feel like I...

4157
02:45:24,740 --> 02:45:26,360
Haven't grabbed anything...

4158
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,340
We at least got a new...

4159
02:45:30,440 --> 02:45:30,800
Ingredient...

4160
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:38,840
Grass...

4161
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:41,720
Got some flesh...

4162
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:45,600
It's hard to...

4163
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:47,480
Go around in this one though...

4164
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:52,500
I fear...

4165
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:55,360
Oh gosh...

4166
02:45:55,360 --> 02:45:56,060
Wait, are we gonna make it?

4167
02:45:57,900 --> 02:45:58,700
Oh God...

4168
02:45:58,700 --> 02:45:59,880
No, no, no, no...

4169
02:45:59,880 --> 02:46:00,760
There we go...

4170
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:01,740
Okay, we got some...

4171
02:46:01,740 --> 02:46:02,940
Some air...

4172
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:03,700
Back...

4173
02:46:03,700 --> 02:46:04,580
Oh my gosh...

4174
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:05,820
The ceiling is so high...

4175
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:11,850
Too much water...

4176
02:46:11,850 --> 02:46:12,870
And not enough water...

4177
02:46:12,870 --> 02:46:13,790
It's like...

4178
02:46:13,790 --> 02:46:14,650
Way too much water...

4179
02:46:15,290 --> 02:46:17,650
I didn't expect we would be getting such a watery...

4180
02:46:18,390 --> 02:46:18,990
Area...

4181
02:46:18,990 --> 02:46:19,230
You know?

4182
02:46:21,350 --> 02:46:21,950
It's...

4183
02:46:21,950 --> 02:46:22,750
Like...

4184
02:46:22,750 --> 02:46:24,290
Why so much water?

4185
02:46:24,290 --> 02:46:24,930
Water...

4186
02:46:26,590 --> 02:46:27,250
Why...

4187
02:46:27,250 --> 02:46:28,170
So much water?

4188
02:46:32,990 --> 02:46:34,330
This would be great...

4189
02:46:34,330 --> 02:46:35,230
If I had like a...

4190
02:46:35,230 --> 02:46:35,890
Potion...

4191
02:46:35,890 --> 02:46:37,090
For water breathing...

4192
02:46:37,090 --> 02:46:38,530
Oh, there's another one up there...

4193
02:46:38,530 --> 02:46:39,330
Even...

4194
02:46:41,650 --> 02:46:42,310
Wow...

4195
02:46:42,310 --> 02:46:43,170
Two out of ten...

4196
02:46:43,170 --> 02:46:43,970
Too much water...

4197
02:46:43,970 --> 02:46:44,570
Spoken...

4198
02:46:44,570 --> 02:46:44,970
I was...

4199
02:46:44,970 --> 02:46:46,890
I was literally just thinking that...

4200
02:46:46,890 --> 02:46:51,410
I was literally just thinking that...

4201
02:46:51,410 --> 02:46:53,410
But I wanna explore some more...

4202
02:46:53,410 --> 02:46:54,030
Oh...

4203
02:46:54,030 --> 02:46:54,470
Oh...

4204
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:54,870
Okay...

4205
02:46:54,870 --> 02:46:55,770
Excuse me...

4206
02:46:55,770 --> 02:46:57,630
Because I wanna see more of the cave...

4207
02:46:57,630 --> 02:46:59,170
It's just so bright in here...

4208
02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:00,370
It's...

4209
02:47:01,050 --> 02:47:02,510
Magumai's Walrus Kaiju...

4210
02:47:02,510 --> 02:47:04,710
That was in Toho's 1962 film...

4211
02:47:04,710 --> 02:47:05,310
Gorath...

4212
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:06,730
Wow...

4213
02:47:07,270 --> 02:47:08,310
I learned...

4214
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:14,500
I did not know that...

4215
02:47:15,720 --> 02:47:16,140
Maguma...

4216
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:17,660
There's that one over here...

4217
02:47:17,660 --> 02:47:18,610
This one doesn't look so deep...

4218
02:47:21,940 --> 02:47:23,240
I guess let's...

4219
02:47:26,260 --> 02:47:27,480
Let's just go...

4220
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:30,840
Exploring by water is too slow...

4221
02:47:30,840 --> 02:47:32,500
And I don't think I can get back up there...

4222
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:34,300
So...

4223
02:47:34,300 --> 02:47:35,500
We'll just go home...

4224
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:39,500
Let's just leave...

4225
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:41,660
Wait, is that a geode?

4226
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:42,660
Do you see that?

4227
02:47:43,580 --> 02:47:45,440
It's like perfectly round...

4228
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:47,700
You don't think that's a geode, right?

4229
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:49,960
It looks...

4230
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:51,000
It looks weird though, no?

4231
02:47:53,380 --> 02:47:55,700
Look, there's even beyond...

4232
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:57,880
There's even deeper...

4233
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:01,220
Giant egg...

4234
02:48:02,780 --> 02:48:04,600
That has to be a geode...

4235
02:48:04,600 --> 02:48:04,780
Right?

4236
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:08,760
It's so deep down though...

4237
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:09,160
Hold on...

4238
02:48:09,160 --> 02:48:10,280
Maybe we can find a...

4239
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:11,320
A bubble...

4240
02:48:11,320 --> 02:48:12,700
To pull us down...

4241
02:48:13,380 --> 02:48:14,060
Under...

4242
02:48:17,090 --> 02:48:18,970
Has to be a geode...

4243
02:48:18,970 --> 02:48:20,090
I think so...

4244
02:48:24,790 --> 02:48:26,150
Hold on...

4245
02:48:26,150 --> 02:48:27,450
Where's the...

4246
02:48:27,450 --> 02:48:28,850
I can't tell what's lava...

4247
02:48:28,850 --> 02:48:29,350
And what's...

4248
02:48:29,350 --> 02:48:30,050
Magma...

4249
02:48:30,050 --> 02:48:31,130
There we go...

4250
02:48:35,290 --> 02:48:35,990
Weeeee...

4251
02:48:35,990 --> 02:48:36,850
Woohoo...

4252
02:48:36,850 --> 02:48:37,310
Uh oh...

4253
02:48:37,310 --> 02:48:38,150
I'm losing...

4254
02:48:38,150 --> 02:48:38,990
There we go...

4255
02:48:40,040 --> 02:48:41,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4256
02:48:42,030 --> 02:48:43,230
You guys...

4257
02:48:43,230 --> 02:48:43,770
Jackpot!

4258
02:48:50,650 --> 02:48:52,950
My eyes did not deceive me!

4259
02:48:55,250 --> 02:48:55,950
Nice...

4260
02:48:55,950 --> 02:48:57,450
I'm gonna put...

4261
02:48:57,450 --> 02:48:58,800
Mine right there...

4262
02:48:59,740 --> 02:49:00,090
Uh...

4263
02:49:06,410 --> 02:49:06,730
Go...

4264
02:49:06,730 --> 02:49:07,130
Okay...

4265
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:11,480
Awesome...

4266
02:49:14,330 --> 02:49:15,030
Ouch!

4267
02:49:15,730 --> 02:49:16,110
What's...

4268
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:17,410
What's killing me?!

4269
02:49:18,020 --> 02:49:18,370
Why?!

4270
02:49:26,770 --> 02:49:28,720
I was on top of my thing, no?

4271
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:33,500
Wait, why is it...

4272
02:49:33,500 --> 02:49:35,080
Why is it not generating?

4273
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:37,990
My magma's broken...

4274
02:49:38,340 --> 02:49:39,360
Yeah, what happened to it?

4275
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:41,980
Why no bubbles?

4276
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:54,180
Let's see now...

4277
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:57,340
Okay, I think we're...

4278
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:58,540
I think we're okay now...

4279
02:49:58,540 --> 02:49:59,260
Let's check...

4280
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:00,060
Nope...

4281
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:01,440
Not this one...

4282
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:02,000
Um...

4283
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:03,520
Hold on...

4284
02:50:06,290 --> 02:50:07,810
This one's okay...

4285
02:50:07,810 --> 02:50:09,690
But this one is not okay...

4286
02:50:13,590 --> 02:50:14,070
Hmm...

4287
02:50:14,070 --> 02:50:16,090
Needs a source block...

4288
02:50:16,470 --> 02:50:17,170
What does that mean?

4289
02:50:18,990 --> 02:50:19,470
Ouch!

4290
02:50:19,810 --> 02:50:20,050
Ouch!

4291
02:50:20,210 --> 02:50:20,310
Ouch!

4292
02:50:20,310 --> 02:50:20,550
Ouch!

4293
02:50:22,530 --> 02:50:23,990
I'm gonna die...

4294
02:50:24,890 --> 02:50:26,110
Warden boss fight!

4295
02:50:26,390 --> 02:50:26,990
Since when?

4296
02:50:37,190 --> 02:50:38,770
Still no good...

4297
02:50:39,670 --> 02:50:41,030
I wish I had...

4298
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:41,680
A food...

4299
02:50:55,910 --> 02:50:57,900
I think we can go in here now though...

4300
02:51:04,230 --> 02:51:04,890
Yes!

4301
02:51:05,650 --> 02:51:06,310
Yes!

4302
02:51:06,610 --> 02:51:07,110
Yes!

4303
02:51:08,010 --> 02:51:08,670
Okay...

4304
02:51:08,670 --> 02:51:09,190
Awesome...

4305
02:51:09,190 --> 02:51:10,370
There's nothing in here...

4306
02:51:10,370 --> 02:51:10,850
Nice!

4307
02:51:12,170 --> 02:51:12,870
You know what?

4308
02:51:13,070 --> 02:51:14,350
We're not coming back here...

4309
02:51:14,350 --> 02:51:15,730
We're just taking everything...

4310
02:51:18,850 --> 02:51:19,250
Yes!

4311
02:51:20,770 --> 02:51:22,370
If I eat the rotten meat...

4312
02:51:23,970 --> 02:51:25,810
I think it'll be okay...

4313
02:51:26,650 --> 02:51:27,450
You think it...

4314
02:51:27,450 --> 02:51:28,530
Do you think that's better than nothing?

4315
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:42,060
We're taking everything, baby...

4316
02:51:44,620 --> 02:51:45,800
You've done it before...

4317
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:46,840
To regain health...

4318
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:47,740
Okay, yeah...

4319
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:48,060
I think...

4320
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:48,900
I think you're right...

4321
02:51:48,900 --> 02:51:49,680
Oh, you're still right!

4322
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:50,760
Yeah...

4323
02:51:54,820 --> 02:51:55,340
Yes!

4324
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:56,140
Yes!

4325
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:56,740
Yes!

4326
02:52:05,890 --> 02:52:07,430
Do these also...

4327
02:52:07,430 --> 02:52:08,330
Count for anything?

4328
02:52:10,170 --> 02:52:10,690
Or...

4329
02:52:15,620 --> 02:52:17,380
Ding, ding, dong, ding, ding!

4330
02:52:17,940 --> 02:52:18,460
Wow!

4331
02:52:19,340 --> 02:52:21,200
That's a lot...

4332
02:52:22,060 --> 02:52:22,580
Of...

4333
02:52:22,580 --> 02:52:23,380
XP, baby!

4334
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:25,340
And look...

4335
02:52:25,340 --> 02:52:26,860
The warden boss fight!

4336
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:28,480
That sounds really horrifying...

4337
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:29,380
And terrifying...

4338
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:30,840
And...

4339
02:52:30,840 --> 02:52:32,080
I don't like anything...

4340
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:32,780
I wanna do!

4341
02:52:39,160 --> 02:52:41,280
Getting back up is gonna be a doozy...

4342
02:52:41,280 --> 02:52:41,740
But...

4343
02:52:41,740 --> 02:52:43,200
I believe in us...

4344
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,380
I believe in us, everybody...

4345
02:52:47,640 --> 02:52:48,560
I believe...

4346
02:52:48,560 --> 02:52:49,040
I believe...

4347
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:49,580
I believe...

4348
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:50,000
I believe...

4349
02:52:59,330 --> 02:53:00,150
I feel...

4350
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:01,070
It feels so wrong...

4351
02:53:01,070 --> 02:53:02,890
Breaking the ones with the X's on it...

4352
02:53:03,710 --> 02:53:04,170
Hahaha...

4353
02:53:04,170 --> 02:53:05,790
It feels so wrong...

4354
02:53:08,470 --> 02:53:10,790
What does a warden boss fight even entail?

4355
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:12,810
You have to...

4356
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:17,620
You have to...

4357
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:18,380
So, defeat him?

4358
02:53:18,580 --> 02:53:20,340
Doesn't that guy have like a million HP?

4359
02:53:25,060 --> 02:53:26,120
Lots of death.

4360
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:29,300
Yeah, I'd imagine so.

4361
02:53:33,580 --> 02:53:35,680
A full stack is 12!

4362
02:53:36,680 --> 02:53:37,080
Damn.

4363
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:38,960
I think that's the most we've gotten.

4364
02:53:42,730 --> 02:53:45,810
I think that's the most HP or XP we've gotten.

4365
02:53:47,790 --> 02:53:48,150
Okay.

4366
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:53,240
I want to keep going, but...

4367
02:53:58,770 --> 02:54:00,270
How do I get the top ones?

4368
02:54:00,370 --> 02:54:01,850
I guess we can just use...

4369
02:54:02,910 --> 02:54:03,790
Like this.

4370
02:54:04,950 --> 02:54:05,810
The calcite.

4371
02:54:06,090 --> 02:54:07,490
How much is the calcite worth?

4372
02:54:11,990 --> 02:54:13,150
There's an exit nearby.

4373
02:54:13,350 --> 02:54:13,730
Yeah, yeah.

4374
02:54:16,730 --> 02:54:18,510
So, we just gotta get to it.

4375
02:54:21,350 --> 02:54:23,390
Okay, since we're already at the bottom...

4376
02:54:24,370 --> 02:54:25,770
It shouldn't be too difficult.

4377
02:54:25,770 --> 02:54:26,750
Hopefully.

4378
02:54:27,170 --> 02:54:27,190
Hopefully.

4379
02:54:27,230 --> 02:54:27,790
I say.

4380
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:29,710
I say.

4381
02:54:29,970 --> 02:54:30,570
I pray.

4382
02:54:32,090 --> 02:54:32,650
Okay.

4383
02:54:36,900 --> 02:54:38,540
I don't want any of it...

4384
02:54:38,540 --> 02:54:39,540
Despawning.

4385
02:54:40,340 --> 02:54:40,700
Come here.

4386
02:54:40,820 --> 02:54:41,020
Come here.

4387
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:41,400
Okay.

4388
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:44,720
Let's go to the side.

4389
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:46,440
Okay.

4390
02:54:46,820 --> 02:54:47,100
Alright.

4391
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:48,140
Alright.

4392
02:54:50,920 --> 02:54:53,220
I'm gonna say enough for a cute ghost attacks.

4393
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:54,920
Thank you!

4394
02:54:55,380 --> 02:54:55,840
Oh, no!

4395
02:54:56,620 --> 02:54:57,140
My...

4396
02:54:57,140 --> 02:54:58,700
My pickaxe is almost...

4397
02:54:58,700 --> 02:55:00,680
You guys, my pickaxe is almost up!

4398
02:55:09,410 --> 02:55:12,110
I might have just enough to finish the cave.

4399
02:55:13,370 --> 02:55:13,890
Ouch.

4400
02:55:14,310 --> 02:55:15,250
I shouldn't have done that.

4401
02:55:15,390 --> 02:55:15,850
Ouchie, ouch.

4402
02:55:16,490 --> 02:55:18,610
But I didn't want to use it on the calcite.

4403
02:55:35,030 --> 02:55:36,730
Someone said save for magma blocks.

4404
02:55:36,870 --> 02:55:37,910
And I do have one...

4405
02:55:37,910 --> 02:55:38,910
Well, this is...

4406
02:55:39,770 --> 02:55:40,510
I don't know.

4407
02:55:42,130 --> 02:55:44,370
Let me see how close we are to...

4408
02:55:44,370 --> 02:55:45,070
Ouch.

4409
02:55:45,550 --> 02:55:46,150
Oh, gosh.

4410
02:55:47,090 --> 02:55:48,050
To the exit.

4411
02:55:48,550 --> 02:55:49,990
I do not see...

4412
02:55:50,330 --> 02:55:50,970
The exit.

4413
02:55:53,390 --> 02:55:55,830
But there's a lot of magma blocks around.

4414
02:56:00,590 --> 02:56:02,410
I thought we were close, no?

4415
02:56:02,650 --> 02:56:03,430
Maybe it's this way.

4416
02:56:07,370 --> 02:56:08,030
There it is!

4417
02:56:08,310 --> 02:56:08,410
Okay.

4418
02:56:14,940 --> 02:56:16,100
I think we can make it.

4419
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:16,900
I think we'll be okay.

4420
02:56:22,480 --> 02:56:23,460
So we can get more.

4421
02:56:24,480 --> 02:56:25,140
We'll do...

4422
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:26,120
We'll just go until it breaks.

4423
02:56:30,750 --> 02:56:32,130
We'll go until it breaks, baby.

4424
02:56:33,850 --> 02:56:34,710
Famous last word.

4425
02:56:34,870 --> 02:56:35,030
Stop!

4426
02:56:35,270 --> 02:56:35,930
Oh, there it is.

4427
02:56:36,030 --> 02:56:36,790
There it goes.

4428
02:56:37,650 --> 02:56:38,010
Alright!

4429
02:56:38,210 --> 02:56:39,070
Time to go home!

4430
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:55,340
Alright.

4431
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:56,500
We can make this.

4432
02:56:58,820 --> 02:56:59,580
Oh, yeah.

4433
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:00,620
Oh, yeah.

4434
02:57:00,780 --> 02:57:01,500
Oh, yeah.

4435
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:02,240
Oh, yeah.

4436
02:57:02,380 --> 02:57:03,960
I'm just being extra cautious.

4437
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:05,240
Oh, yeah.

4438
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:07,460
And look at that!

4439
02:57:10,840 --> 02:57:11,400
Yippee!

4440
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:14,340
Logan!

4441
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:15,240
Welcome to the Vapashop.

4442
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:15,840
Thank you!

4443
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:39,700
That was so...

4444
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:44,320
So satisfying.

4445
02:57:45,140 --> 02:57:45,820
Wow!

4446
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:48,100
Our most lucrative world yet!

4447
02:57:55,490 --> 02:57:58,090
All the way to level 80!

4448
02:58:00,770 --> 02:58:01,750
Yeah, baby!

4449
02:58:04,430 --> 02:58:05,230
Wow!

4450
02:58:06,550 --> 02:58:08,370
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

4451
02:58:08,630 --> 02:58:09,790
Let's use our...

4452
02:58:09,790 --> 02:58:11,290
Let's use our upgrades.

4453
02:58:11,290 --> 02:58:12,450
And then we're gonna do...

4454
02:58:12,450 --> 02:58:14,090
The Warden.

4455
02:58:14,090 --> 02:58:15,210
And then I'll call it.

4456
02:58:16,430 --> 02:58:16,990
Let's see.

4457
02:58:17,110 --> 02:58:18,450
What should we upgrade, you guys?

4458
02:58:23,450 --> 02:58:25,210
Actually, I'm going to...

4459
02:58:25,210 --> 02:58:26,510
Go to the bathroom real quick.

4460
02:58:27,470 --> 02:58:29,090
While we decide...

4461
02:58:29,890 --> 02:58:30,750
What to do.

4462
02:58:32,730 --> 02:58:33,430
Hold on.

4463
02:58:36,610 --> 02:58:39,230
Remind me to harvest a geode next time I go mining.

4464
02:58:39,230 --> 02:58:40,090
Thanks, Vinto.

4465
02:58:40,210 --> 02:58:40,510
Yeah!

4466
02:58:41,490 --> 02:58:42,350
Thank you!

4467
02:58:43,970 --> 02:58:44,790
I'll be right back.

4468
03:01:04,780 --> 03:01:06,200
I looked so pensive.

4469
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:08,720
I looked so...

4470
03:01:09,720 --> 03:01:10,940
I don't know why.

4471
03:01:11,580 --> 03:01:12,580
I am...

4472
03:01:12,580 --> 03:01:13,780
Guys, you probably can't tell.

4473
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:14,480
I don't know.

4474
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:14,700
Maybe.

4475
03:01:14,820 --> 03:01:14,980
Hold on.

4476
03:01:15,020 --> 03:01:15,280
Let me see.

4477
03:01:15,280 --> 03:01:16,860
If I like zoom in.

4478
03:01:17,320 --> 03:01:19,240
See how my bangs part?

4479
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:20,600
Right...

4480
03:01:20,600 --> 03:01:22,420
Right there on the...

4481
03:01:22,420 --> 03:01:23,040
On the...

4482
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,040
Your right side.

4483
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:25,480
So...

4484
03:01:25,960 --> 03:01:29,660
My bangs used to be like completely straight across.

4485
03:01:30,860 --> 03:01:31,540
And...

4486
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:35,600
Recently, I have gotten like a cowlick.

4487
03:01:35,720 --> 03:01:36,600
I don't know why.

4488
03:01:37,060 --> 03:01:40,120
And it's so frustrating because all I want is straight across bangs.

4489
03:01:41,100 --> 03:01:41,460
But...

4490
03:01:42,580 --> 03:01:44,020
Every time...

4491
03:01:44,020 --> 03:01:45,240
I got...

4492
03:01:45,240 --> 03:01:46,500
I got a little cowlick.

4493
03:01:46,640 --> 03:01:47,200
And I...

4494
03:01:47,200 --> 03:01:49,100
Usually, it can be even worse.

4495
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:52,160
It can be even worse.

4496
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:53,080
But I like...

4497
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:55,080
I force it into submission.

4498
03:01:56,260 --> 03:01:57,820
A hogevirus real.

4499
03:01:58,300 --> 03:01:59,240
It's actually...

4500
03:01:59,240 --> 03:02:00,080
I have one.

4501
03:02:00,880 --> 03:02:03,740
And I like always fussing with it.

4502
03:02:03,740 --> 03:02:04,820
A hogevirus.

4503
03:02:06,060 --> 03:02:06,980
A hogevirus.

4504
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:09,420
Can you please zoom in on it more?

4505
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:09,860
What?

4506
03:02:10,760 --> 03:02:12,040
Is this your...

4507
03:02:12,040 --> 03:02:12,240
Kink?

4508
03:02:15,620 --> 03:02:16,640
Right there.

4509
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:17,500
Right...

4510
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:18,120
Right there.

4511
03:02:18,940 --> 03:02:19,600
On the...

4512
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:20,280
On the side.

4513
03:02:26,860 --> 03:02:28,020
That's a big one.

4514
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:28,400
No!

4515
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:30,900
No!

4516
03:02:32,860 --> 03:02:34,540
It always bothers me.

4517
03:02:35,080 --> 03:02:35,920
Alright, guys.

4518
03:02:38,500 --> 03:02:39,120
For...

4519
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:40,120
The...

4520
03:02:40,800 --> 03:02:41,700
Mr. Man's.

4521
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:44,080
The warden.

4522
03:02:49,890 --> 03:02:50,980
We could be faster.

4523
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:54,140
We could sneak faster.

4524
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:56,680
This is possibly even faster than running.

4525
03:02:57,880 --> 03:02:59,160
Swift to sneak.

4526
03:02:59,380 --> 03:02:59,800
No way.

4527
03:03:00,160 --> 03:03:00,660
Vector Tom!

4528
03:03:00,740 --> 03:03:01,480
Thank you so much for the podcast.

4529
03:03:01,680 --> 03:03:02,340
Thank you!

4530
03:03:02,700 --> 03:03:03,260
Armor.

4531
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:04,760
Yeah, armor would be great.

4532
03:03:05,860 --> 03:03:06,800
Decked out.

4533
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:07,780
Oh, gosh.

4534
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:08,760
It's so expensive.

4535
03:03:15,750 --> 03:03:17,730
I kinda want...

4536
03:03:17,730 --> 03:03:19,290
What is this one?

4537
03:03:19,470 --> 03:03:21,350
A natural evolution of a shield.

4538
03:03:21,790 --> 03:03:22,930
What is this?

4539
03:03:24,690 --> 03:03:26,870
For anyone who has played this before.

4540
03:03:27,350 --> 03:03:28,630
It's a mace?

4541
03:03:32,530 --> 03:03:34,870
Is that a new thing in Minecraft?

4542
03:03:38,330 --> 03:03:39,550
Is that new?

4543
03:03:41,390 --> 03:03:43,330
Did they recently add this?

4544
03:03:43,790 --> 03:03:45,470
Oh, it's a new weapon.

4545
03:03:46,110 --> 03:03:46,850
Really?

4546
03:03:47,970 --> 03:03:50,950
I didn't even know that they added that.

4547
03:03:51,770 --> 03:03:52,290
Wow.

4548
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:59,260
It's in the trial chambers.

4549
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:00,580
Wow!

4550
03:04:01,340 --> 03:04:02,700
It came with the trial chambers.

4551
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:06,200
Deals more damage if you fall further before hitting.

4552
03:04:06,440 --> 03:04:07,060
What?

4553
03:04:07,920 --> 03:04:09,380
It's a rare reward.

4554
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:10,180
Wow!

4555
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:13,620
I thought it was something for this.

4556
03:04:13,880 --> 03:04:14,000
Okay.

4557
03:04:14,680 --> 03:04:17,200
Maybe we get the shiny sword.

4558
03:04:17,560 --> 03:04:18,700
And we get...

4559
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:20,360
Hold on.

4560
03:04:24,090 --> 03:04:26,250
Okay, I can't get the shiny sword anymore.

4561
03:04:27,810 --> 03:04:29,710
We could get the archer.

4562
03:04:40,360 --> 03:04:43,120
I just don't understand why the shield doesn't work.

4563
03:04:46,120 --> 03:04:46,680
Oops.

4564
03:04:46,860 --> 03:04:47,680
Spent it all on armor.

4565
03:04:48,080 --> 03:04:48,320
Oops.

4566
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:49,000
Oops!

4567
03:04:56,210 --> 03:04:57,950
You can one-shot the warden?

4568
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,390
How?

4569
03:04:59,630 --> 03:05:00,190
Spellbook?

4570
03:05:01,850 --> 03:05:02,770
What is that?

4571
03:05:02,950 --> 03:05:03,610
I'm curious.

4572
03:05:05,570 --> 03:05:09,910
Wait, it also says touch the campfire after unlocking a spellbook.

4573
03:05:10,030 --> 03:05:11,310
What does that mean?

4574
03:05:13,130 --> 03:05:13,670
Hmm...

4575
03:05:13,670 --> 03:05:14,590
Let's get the archer one.

4576
03:05:18,370 --> 03:05:18,910
Okay.

4577
03:05:19,170 --> 03:05:20,430
Now I have nothing.

4578
03:05:20,690 --> 03:05:21,510
Which is great.

4579
03:05:21,510 --> 03:05:23,450
Because if I die, I lose nothing.

4580
03:05:24,780 --> 03:05:25,050
So...

4581
03:05:25,730 --> 03:05:26,270
Warden.

4582
03:05:26,670 --> 03:05:27,210
Warden.

4583
03:05:27,690 --> 03:05:28,230
Warden.

4584
03:05:28,650 --> 03:05:29,190
Warden.

4585
03:05:29,330 --> 03:05:30,770
Wait, what if he's not in the deep dark?

4586
03:05:32,530 --> 03:05:33,890
What if he's...

4587
03:05:33,890 --> 03:05:35,530
Mushroom Fields Bio?

4588
03:05:36,070 --> 03:05:38,050
What if he's just...

4589
03:05:38,050 --> 03:05:39,070
Doing his thing?

4590
03:05:39,070 --> 03:05:40,330
What if he's just out and about?

4591
03:05:42,090 --> 03:05:42,670
Warden.

4592
03:05:43,070 --> 03:05:43,650
Warden.

4593
03:05:44,130 --> 03:05:44,710
Warden.

4594
03:05:45,230 --> 03:05:45,810
Warden.

4595
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:47,830
We're not gonna do the explosive traps.

4596
03:05:48,910 --> 03:05:50,730
Warden wards off the competition.

4597
03:05:56,420 --> 03:05:57,480
Do you have lava?

4598
03:05:58,940 --> 03:06:00,280
I could get lava.

4599
03:06:01,640 --> 03:06:03,100
Let's try the squishy...

4600
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:04,420
Squishy magma cubes.

4601
03:06:04,420 --> 03:06:05,200
I kind of want to see...

4602
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:07,320
Let's just make something really random and weird.

4603
03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:08,340
Okay!

4604
03:06:27,890 --> 03:06:29,170
Why do I hear people?

4605
03:06:30,750 --> 03:06:31,710
What the hell?

4606
03:06:36,850 --> 03:06:37,650
What is...

4607
03:06:37,650 --> 03:06:38,630
What is going on here?

4608
03:06:38,870 --> 03:06:39,790
What is this?

4609
03:06:39,790 --> 03:06:40,790
What is this?

4610
03:06:42,590 --> 03:06:43,870
I finally...

4611
03:06:43,870 --> 03:06:44,930
We got our mushroom biome.

4612
03:06:47,390 --> 03:06:49,110
I hear the warden.

4613
03:06:49,750 --> 03:06:51,090
Is he down there?

4614
03:06:54,590 --> 03:06:55,850
Is he inside there?

4615
03:06:56,870 --> 03:06:58,490
That's your boss fight.

4616
03:06:58,910 --> 03:06:59,290
What?

4617
03:07:01,210 --> 03:07:01,950
No way.

4618
03:07:02,450 --> 03:07:02,850
Um...

4619
03:07:02,850 --> 03:07:03,050
Hold on.

4620
03:07:03,110 --> 03:07:03,810
I need to get over there?

4621
03:07:06,070 --> 03:07:06,470
Oh!

4622
03:07:06,670 --> 03:07:08,210
I got a bow, but no arrows.

4623
03:07:17,530 --> 03:07:19,090
Kinda creepy with the villagers.

4624
03:07:19,490 --> 03:07:21,230
I don't understand what's going on.

4625
03:07:24,370 --> 03:07:25,250
Is this enough?

4626
03:07:25,430 --> 03:07:25,530
Is this enough?

4627
03:07:25,530 --> 03:07:25,770
I don't know.

4628
03:07:26,090 --> 03:07:26,470
Whatever.

4629
03:07:26,930 --> 03:07:28,230
I just want to get over there.

4630
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:33,970
Maybe it's not enough.

4631
03:07:36,230 --> 03:07:37,190
Maybe it's not enough.

4632
03:07:37,670 --> 03:07:38,050
Dang it.

4633
03:07:40,310 --> 03:07:40,710
There!

4634
03:07:40,830 --> 03:07:42,130
I see a magma cube down there!

4635
03:07:42,290 --> 03:07:43,270
This is so weird!

4636
03:07:46,870 --> 03:07:48,110
But she's so kawaii.

4637
03:07:48,110 --> 03:07:48,850
Oh no!

4638
03:07:53,070 --> 03:07:57,520
This is so weird.

4639
03:07:57,900 --> 03:07:59,600
They're watching like it's a cage fight.

4640
03:07:59,720 --> 03:08:01,140
Is that actually what's going on here?

4641
03:08:02,440 --> 03:08:03,020
Wait!

4642
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:06,560
The exit's right there, you guys!

4643
03:08:10,360 --> 03:08:13,580
Why are we getting these exits like this recently?

4644
03:08:14,480 --> 03:08:17,380
The exit's right there.

4645
03:08:18,220 --> 03:08:19,400
I could leave.

4646
03:08:19,780 --> 03:08:21,760
But I don't get my warden boss fight.

4647
03:08:26,240 --> 03:08:27,880
Let's make it nice and easy.

4648
03:08:28,280 --> 03:08:30,080
For us to...

4649
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:31,500
Get over here.

4650
03:08:38,020 --> 03:08:39,480
They're not going to push me in, are they?

4651
03:08:45,160 --> 03:08:46,660
What is this?

4652
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:48,520
What is this?

4653
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:49,680
This is so weird!

4654
03:08:51,280 --> 03:08:51,840
What?

4655
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:01,860
Oh, he's just right there.

4656
03:09:03,740 --> 03:09:05,360
Is he like sleeping or...

4657
03:09:06,400 --> 03:09:07,680
There's like a...

4658
03:09:11,950 --> 03:09:13,490
What is happening?

4659
03:09:14,630 --> 03:09:15,510
What

4660
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:21,200
is happening?

4661
03:09:24,120 --> 03:09:24,560
What

4662
03:09:34,560 --> 03:09:35,880
if I go onto this...

4663
03:09:35,880 --> 03:09:36,200
Here.

4664
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:38,720
Is he a...

4665
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:39,640
Is he snoring?

4666
03:09:41,100 --> 03:09:42,820
I think he's snoring.

4667
03:09:58,490 --> 03:09:59,070
Why is he a warden?

4668
03:09:59,070 --> 03:09:59,810
Aw, man!

4669
03:10:03,980 --> 03:10:05,710
In the end, I didn't even lose to the...

4670
03:10:05,710 --> 03:10:06,850
A stick at warden!

4671
03:10:07,350 --> 03:10:07,430
Oh!

4672
03:10:09,310 --> 03:10:11,050
Get your groove on.

4673
03:10:14,510 --> 03:10:17,070
What happens if you die in a boss battle?

4674
03:10:19,630 --> 03:10:20,610
What happens?

4675
03:10:21,170 --> 03:10:22,630
Wait, it's actual warden time?

4676
03:10:22,790 --> 03:10:22,970
Real?

4677
03:10:26,590 --> 03:10:28,090
You die for real.

4678
03:10:28,930 --> 03:10:30,030
I'm already dead.

4679
03:10:30,330 --> 03:10:31,830
Because I have nothing to lose!

4680
03:10:32,990 --> 03:10:36,750
Okay, since I died so quickly in that one, we'll do this, maybe.

4681
03:10:36,970 --> 03:10:37,630
Unless I die.

4682
03:10:37,830 --> 03:10:39,070
And then we'll, you know.

4683
03:10:48,110 --> 03:10:49,710
Why did I get that wild blow?

4684
03:10:52,590 --> 03:10:54,230
Oh, it's happening again!

4685
03:10:55,090 --> 03:10:56,550
What is going on?

4686
03:10:57,270 --> 03:10:59,210
Why do they keep floating in the sky?

4687
03:11:05,440 --> 03:11:06,860
Why does this keep happening?

4688
03:11:11,060 --> 03:11:12,500
Hold on, I'm trying to find...

4689
03:11:12,500 --> 03:11:14,100
Wait, is this an actual village?

4690
03:11:16,580 --> 03:11:17,680
Yes, there's a village!

4691
03:11:18,620 --> 03:11:20,860
This is my first time seeing a village in these places.

4692
03:11:23,500 --> 03:11:25,240
I hear them just...

4693
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:26,160
They're coming everywhere.

4694
03:11:30,740 --> 03:11:32,160
I've never seen a village.

4695
03:11:36,370 --> 03:11:37,570
Oh, it's gone quiet.

4696
03:11:38,370 --> 03:11:40,710
I wonder when they will go at...

4697
03:11:40,710 --> 03:11:41,270
Start the fight.

4698
03:11:41,490 --> 03:11:42,350
Wait, what do you mean by that?

4699
03:11:44,650 --> 03:11:45,510
Wait, what do you...

4700
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:45,690
What?

4701
03:11:45,930 --> 03:11:46,370
Who's...

4702
03:11:46,370 --> 03:11:47,530
Are those my thoughts?

4703
03:11:47,670 --> 03:11:48,210
Who's thinking?

4704
03:11:49,330 --> 03:11:49,930
Huh?

4705
03:11:50,310 --> 03:11:51,190
I'm a sentient?

4706
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:58,020
I'm not trying to ignore it.

4707
03:11:58,120 --> 03:12:00,100
I just want to see the village.

4708
03:12:02,100 --> 03:12:03,660
There's two of them.

4709
03:12:04,720 --> 03:12:06,580
I just wanted to see the village.

4710
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:07,540
Ouch.

4711
03:12:11,690 --> 03:12:12,790
I've never...

4712
03:12:12,790 --> 03:12:15,810
It was an achievement to trade with a villager.

4713
03:12:18,470 --> 03:12:20,790
And maybe they have things that I can...

4714
03:12:20,790 --> 03:12:21,290
You know...

4715
03:12:21,290 --> 03:12:22,270
Like a bunch of bread.

4716
03:12:23,650 --> 03:12:23,990
Wait.

4717
03:12:26,950 --> 03:12:27,990
Find some arrows.

4718
03:12:28,150 --> 03:12:29,230
I'm trying to find anything.

4719
03:12:34,130 --> 03:12:35,550
Trying to get anything.

4720
03:12:36,270 --> 03:12:36,590
Okay.

4721
03:12:43,910 --> 03:12:44,850
We got a horse.

4722
03:12:45,770 --> 03:12:46,770
Can I ride that horse?

4723
03:12:48,210 --> 03:12:49,850
When will they start the horn?

4724
03:12:50,010 --> 03:12:50,130
What?

4725
03:12:50,210 --> 03:12:51,350
That was so ominous.

4726
03:12:52,510 --> 03:12:54,030
It's so ominous.

4727
03:12:54,050 --> 03:12:54,590
Scary.

4728
03:12:56,290 --> 03:12:57,230
No sleep for you.

4729
03:12:57,770 --> 03:12:58,650
Not today.

4730
03:13:02,150 --> 03:13:02,910
Jobless.

4731
03:13:10,190 --> 03:13:12,710
Suddenly starting to feel like we're playing regular Minecraft.

4732
03:13:13,550 --> 03:13:14,850
This village is useless.

4733
03:13:16,610 --> 03:13:18,070
I'm literally nothing.

4734
03:13:18,470 --> 03:13:20,330
Not even a crafting table.

4735
03:13:21,030 --> 03:13:22,030
Take the bell.

4736
03:13:22,910 --> 03:13:23,470
Can I?

4737
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:29,880
Whoa.

4738
03:13:29,880 --> 03:13:31,380
It's just like a...

4739
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:33,680
Giant stage in the sky.

4740
03:13:42,200 --> 03:13:44,120
Everyone's unemployed because of the cult.

4741
03:13:44,920 --> 03:13:45,200
Clearly.

4742
03:13:48,300 --> 03:13:50,940
Let's go to the other side of the village.

4743
03:13:50,940 --> 03:13:51,700
I suppose.

4744
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:53,160
And then...

4745
03:13:53,160 --> 03:13:54,360
We'll go...

4746
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:55,640
Die in battle.

4747
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:04,060
Oh good.

4748
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:05,120
There's more...

4749
03:14:05,120 --> 03:14:05,460
Whoa.

4750
03:14:06,220 --> 03:14:07,720
There's some more...

4751
03:14:07,720 --> 03:14:08,300
Bread.

4752
03:14:08,720 --> 03:14:09,060
Bread.

4753
03:14:10,480 --> 03:14:10,840
Yes.

4754
03:14:13,180 --> 03:14:19,220
I think bread will be our fastest, easiest way to get food right now.

4755
03:14:20,300 --> 03:14:22,340
They haven't even cooked any...

4756
03:14:22,340 --> 03:14:23,540
They haven't grown anything.

4757
03:14:31,410 --> 03:14:33,150
This village is crazy.

4758
03:14:33,610 --> 03:14:34,530
There's so much going on.

4759
03:14:36,050 --> 03:14:36,690
Bread.

4760
03:14:37,470 --> 03:14:38,910
Bread, bread, bread.

4761
03:14:39,310 --> 03:14:40,250
More bread.

4762
03:14:40,810 --> 03:14:40,870
Bread.

4763
03:14:43,130 --> 03:14:44,130
I'm not ignoring.

4764
03:14:44,330 --> 03:14:45,370
Please don't sound the horn.

4765
03:14:45,630 --> 03:14:45,890
I don't...

4766
03:14:45,890 --> 03:14:46,750
I don't know what that means.

4767
03:14:47,570 --> 03:14:49,150
I don't know what the horn means.

4768
03:14:55,290 --> 03:14:55,750
Boy.

4769
03:14:59,590 --> 03:15:00,050
Okay.

4770
03:15:01,350 --> 03:15:01,870
Oh gosh.

4771
03:15:02,370 --> 03:15:03,370
Oh, pull butt load.

4772
03:15:03,510 --> 03:15:03,790
Let's go.

4773
03:15:09,830 --> 03:15:11,130
Just one moment, please.

4774
03:15:11,770 --> 03:15:12,670
Give me a second.

4775
03:15:12,670 --> 03:15:13,790
More bread.

4776
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:16,190
Give me a moment.

4777
03:15:16,950 --> 03:15:18,350
I'm collecting my thoughts.

4778
03:15:19,610 --> 03:15:21,170
I'm preparing myself for battle.

4779
03:15:21,330 --> 03:15:22,070
I'm doing my ritual.

4780
03:15:22,930 --> 03:15:23,250
Bread.

4781
03:15:23,470 --> 03:15:23,650
Oh wait.

4782
03:15:23,810 --> 03:15:24,650
Is it wheat?

4783
03:15:26,690 --> 03:15:27,170
Okay.

4784
03:15:27,310 --> 03:15:27,790
Nice.

4785
03:15:28,010 --> 03:15:29,070
And then...

4786
03:15:29,070 --> 03:15:29,630
Bread.

4787
03:15:30,790 --> 03:15:32,670
I need a crafting table for bread!

4788
03:15:35,810 --> 03:15:37,030
What was that building?

4789
03:15:37,250 --> 03:15:37,670
This one?

4790
03:15:37,810 --> 03:15:40,290
This is like the little church, I guess you call it.

4791
03:15:42,190 --> 03:15:42,830
Wait.

4792
03:15:43,130 --> 03:15:44,450
I can just steal your wood.

4793
03:15:52,490 --> 03:15:53,370
Thank you!

4794
03:16:00,300 --> 03:16:01,580
Can I eat these?

4795
03:16:04,820 --> 03:16:05,460
Nice.

4796
03:16:07,220 --> 03:16:08,800
Do they provide me anything?

4797
03:16:09,060 --> 03:16:09,240
No.

4798
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:15,160
This village has actually nothing.

4799
03:16:18,460 --> 03:16:19,100
Hello.

4800
03:16:22,610 --> 03:16:22,950
I...

4801
03:16:22,950 --> 03:16:23,810
Emeralds!

4802
03:16:24,210 --> 03:16:25,050
Oh, gosh.

4803
03:16:25,170 --> 03:16:25,590
Scared me.

4804
03:16:26,410 --> 03:16:27,330
I don't have...

4805
03:16:27,330 --> 03:16:28,150
I'm broke.

4806
03:16:28,630 --> 03:16:29,850
I'm actually broke.

4807
03:16:30,130 --> 03:16:31,510
I've got absolutely nothing.

4808
03:16:31,870 --> 03:16:32,550
Wait a second.

4809
03:16:32,750 --> 03:16:34,290
If I can make...

4810
03:16:35,710 --> 03:16:36,250
A...

4811
03:16:38,430 --> 03:16:39,310
A bucket.

4812
03:16:39,310 --> 03:16:40,450
I could get the lava.

4813
03:16:41,190 --> 03:16:43,170
That could be something to kill him, no?

4814
03:16:44,170 --> 03:16:44,710
Right?

4815
03:16:44,910 --> 03:16:45,090
Maybe?

4816
03:16:49,770 --> 03:16:50,970
Stick to Emerald.

4817
03:16:51,130 --> 03:16:51,950
Is that what he...

4818
03:16:51,950 --> 03:16:52,790
Did he take that?

4819
03:16:54,450 --> 03:16:55,910
Stick to Emerald!

4820
03:16:59,230 --> 03:17:00,710
What was I going to do with this again?

4821
03:17:01,290 --> 03:17:02,190
What was I making?

4822
03:17:02,810 --> 03:17:02,910
Oh!

4823
03:17:03,110 --> 03:17:03,950
A crafting table.

4824
03:17:07,030 --> 03:17:07,950
And now...

4825
03:17:07,950 --> 03:17:09,190
We make some bread.

4826
03:17:10,470 --> 03:17:12,610
The most bread we've ever had in our life.

4827
03:17:14,410 --> 03:17:14,650
Okay.

4828
03:17:20,960 --> 03:17:22,460
Warden is immune to lava.

4829
03:17:22,680 --> 03:17:23,140
Oh, is he?

4830
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:25,160
Lava bath?

4831
03:17:26,200 --> 03:17:27,220
Would it work?

4832
03:17:27,460 --> 03:17:28,600
Would it work?

4833
03:17:29,780 --> 03:17:30,580
It could.

4834
03:17:30,780 --> 03:17:31,120
It might.

4835
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:32,320
Who knows?

4836
03:17:32,760 --> 03:17:33,660
Who knows?

4837
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:37,760
I think it's worth a try.

4838
03:17:40,300 --> 03:17:41,720
I think it's worth a try.

4839
03:17:43,480 --> 03:17:44,060
Bucket.

4840
03:17:44,240 --> 03:17:44,760
Because...

4841
03:17:44,760 --> 03:17:45,980
We only have three.

4842
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:49,560
That's all we got, baby.

4843
03:17:49,800 --> 03:17:50,760
That's all we've got!

4844
03:17:52,620 --> 03:17:54,500
I think he's immune to lava.

4845
03:17:54,920 --> 03:17:55,920
Time to try!

4846
03:17:57,480 --> 03:17:58,020
Oh.

4847
03:17:58,500 --> 03:17:59,580
The warden is immune.

4848
03:18:04,580 --> 03:18:05,800
Good day to you all.

4849
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:06,580
Good day, good day.

4850
03:18:07,020 --> 03:18:08,160
And good night.

4851
03:18:09,980 --> 03:18:11,320
See you all...

4852
03:18:11,320 --> 03:18:12,260
Never again.

4853
03:18:20,440 --> 03:18:22,240
Oh, I see the exit, even, too.

4854
03:18:23,780 --> 03:18:24,820
Unless it's...

4855
03:18:26,200 --> 03:18:30,360
I have no confidence in winning this, which is why I'm not grabbing, like...

4856
03:18:30,360 --> 03:18:31,120
You know...

4857
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:31,580
Beat.

4858
03:18:32,460 --> 03:18:33,720
Or anything like that.

4859
03:18:34,480 --> 03:18:36,580
I just kind of want to see how this goes.

4860
03:18:37,280 --> 03:18:38,400
To be honest.

4861
03:18:38,780 --> 03:18:40,880
I'm just curious what's gonna happen.

4862
03:18:43,680 --> 03:18:46,160
I'm just kind of winging it, baby.

4863
03:18:48,880 --> 03:18:52,700
Look, it shows the exit right over there, but I can't tell if that's the stage or...

4864
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:53,140
Oh, yeah.

4865
03:18:53,720 --> 03:18:54,420
Oh, yeah.

4866
03:18:54,420 --> 03:18:55,060
It's the stage.

4867
03:18:55,340 --> 03:18:56,300
Oh, yeah.

4868
03:18:56,500 --> 03:18:56,740
It's all right.

4869
03:18:57,160 --> 03:18:57,780
Oh, yeah.

4870
03:18:58,020 --> 03:18:58,940
It's the stage.

4871
03:19:04,400 --> 03:19:06,260
When will they start the fight?

4872
03:19:06,620 --> 03:19:07,420
I don't know.

4873
03:19:07,620 --> 03:19:08,320
Stop saying that.

4874
03:19:09,340 --> 03:19:10,580
I hear him sleeping.

4875
03:19:12,360 --> 03:19:12,800
Double...

4876
03:19:12,800 --> 03:19:14,260
Trump still looks weird.

4877
03:19:14,420 --> 03:19:14,900
Me, too.

4878
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:15,300
Yeah.

4879
03:19:15,300 --> 03:19:16,900
It's so weird.

4880
03:19:24,500 --> 03:19:25,100
Wait.

4881
03:19:26,300 --> 03:19:27,620
Do I go inside?

4882
03:19:33,400 --> 03:19:34,900
This is so weird.

4883
03:19:35,400 --> 03:19:36,420
I'm just gonna use this.

4884
03:19:37,860 --> 03:19:38,820
He died.

4885
03:19:39,020 --> 03:19:39,720
He died of cringe.

4886
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:44,160
Let's get some more...

4887
03:19:45,460 --> 03:19:46,240
Hold on.

4888
03:19:46,740 --> 03:19:48,020
I'm just gonna make a...

4889
03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:51,060
I'm just gonna make a...

4890
03:19:51,060 --> 03:19:52,100
shovel real quick.

4891
03:19:55,960 --> 03:19:57,660
So I can get some...

4892
03:19:58,640 --> 03:19:59,120
dirt.

4893
03:20:03,460 --> 03:20:04,140
Wait, no.

4894
03:20:04,280 --> 03:20:04,700
You think I...

4895
03:20:04,700 --> 03:20:06,720
No, I can hear him literally snoring.

4896
03:20:07,880 --> 03:20:09,280
There's no way that I won.

4897
03:20:09,900 --> 03:20:11,300
I hear him snoring.

4898
03:20:16,740 --> 03:20:17,760
There's no way.

4899
03:20:19,260 --> 03:20:20,340
That's him snoring.

4900
03:20:28,440 --> 03:20:29,580
He's snoring.

4901
03:20:29,580 --> 03:20:30,260
He's snoring right now.

4902
03:20:31,880 --> 03:20:32,520
See?

4903
03:20:54,490 --> 03:20:55,470
Oh, see?

4904
03:20:55,550 --> 03:20:56,130
He's right there.

4905
03:21:11,640 --> 03:21:13,500
What's the door over there for?

4906
03:21:16,020 --> 03:21:16,660
What?

4907
03:21:52,350 --> 03:21:52,770
Storage.

4908
03:22:06,590 --> 03:22:11,290
I want to try it again because there was, like, that room that had, like, heads and stuff in it.

4909
03:22:11,550 --> 03:22:12,410
I want those.

4910
03:22:15,210 --> 03:22:15,630
Ouch.

4911
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:24,160
Sad.

4912
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:25,860
Any door over here?

4913
03:22:25,860 --> 03:22:26,480
Oh.

4914
03:22:26,960 --> 03:22:27,440
Sad.

4915
03:22:27,780 --> 03:22:27,920
Okay.

4916
03:22:31,660 --> 03:22:32,900
You ran a bit far.

4917
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:34,740
The boss deloaded in the exit spot.

4918
03:22:36,500 --> 03:22:37,320
This is...

4919
03:22:37,320 --> 03:22:38,480
This is not possible.

4920
03:22:38,680 --> 03:22:39,460
This is not happening.

4921
03:22:41,180 --> 03:22:41,740
Whoa!

4922
03:22:45,760 --> 03:22:46,320
Okay.

4923
03:22:53,790 --> 03:22:54,910
Wait a second, then.

4924
03:22:55,230 --> 03:22:55,690
Hold on.

4925
03:23:12,410 --> 03:23:13,410
What's in here?

4926
03:23:13,950 --> 03:23:15,370
Bring this to the...

4927
03:23:15,370 --> 03:23:16,270
Get experience.

4928
03:23:17,250 --> 03:23:17,550
Oh.

4929
03:23:17,830 --> 03:23:18,150
Whoa!

4930
03:23:19,170 --> 03:23:20,730
I missed all this stuff in here.

4931
03:23:20,850 --> 03:23:21,270
Wait, what's this?

4932
03:23:23,510 --> 03:23:24,010
Um.

4933
03:23:24,630 --> 03:23:25,650
Oh, turns lights on?

4934
03:23:26,590 --> 03:23:27,430
For what?

4935
03:23:29,230 --> 03:23:30,190
Music disc.

4936
03:23:30,530 --> 03:23:31,750
Tone-Death Rebellion.

4937
03:23:36,120 --> 03:23:37,740
Artemis, thank you so much for the 20th.

4938
03:23:40,560 --> 03:23:42,380
Is this one going to get copyrighted from?

4939
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:47,560
What do you build here?

4940
03:23:49,740 --> 03:23:50,480
Oh!

4941
03:23:51,220 --> 03:23:52,800
What is going on?

4942
03:23:53,240 --> 03:23:55,060
This is like a circus.

4943
03:23:55,700 --> 03:23:56,600
What's happening?

4944
03:24:01,590 --> 03:24:02,910
It's so loud.

4945
03:24:04,810 --> 03:24:05,850
Shut up.

4946
03:24:06,110 --> 03:24:06,370
God.

4947
03:24:15,860 --> 03:24:17,460
Is this part of the fight?

4948
03:24:21,420 --> 03:24:22,900
Is this part of the fight?

4949
03:24:24,120 --> 03:24:24,560
Or...

4950
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:26,560
Use the lava.

4951
03:24:26,720 --> 03:24:27,600
I don't have it anymore.

4952
03:24:29,140 --> 03:24:29,580
Oh.

4953
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:31,740
Oh, it's an instant exit.

4954
03:24:31,940 --> 03:24:32,260
Oh, okay.

4955
03:24:32,300 --> 03:24:33,000
That's what that is.

4956
03:24:36,480 --> 03:24:37,980
Well, that was...

4957
03:24:40,860 --> 03:24:41,300
Something.

4958
03:24:43,660 --> 03:24:44,400
Hold on.

4959
03:24:44,600 --> 03:24:45,400
Hold on.

4960
03:24:46,340 --> 03:24:46,760
Hold!

4961
03:24:47,020 --> 03:24:47,620
Your horses.

4962
03:24:51,780 --> 03:24:53,420
I want to go out like a man.

4963
03:25:00,880 --> 03:25:01,300
Yes.

4964
03:25:03,940 --> 03:25:04,360
And...

4965
03:25:04,360 --> 03:25:04,880
Uh...

4966
03:25:04,880 --> 03:25:06,560
I wish I could get the more arrows.

4967
03:25:07,720 --> 03:25:08,140
Uh...

4968
03:25:08,140 --> 03:25:08,580
Chopper.

4969
03:25:08,800 --> 03:25:09,080
You know what?

4970
03:25:09,080 --> 03:25:09,760
I'm going to get that too.

4971
03:25:10,240 --> 03:25:10,720
Because why not?

4972
03:25:12,580 --> 03:25:13,340
Six levels.

4973
03:25:13,560 --> 03:25:13,740
Whatever.

4974
03:25:14,480 --> 03:25:14,740
Okay.

4975
03:25:17,960 --> 03:25:18,480
I want...

4976
03:25:18,480 --> 03:25:18,820
I want to...

4977
03:25:18,820 --> 03:25:19,860
I want to check it out!

4978
03:25:22,080 --> 03:25:23,300
I want to check it out!

4979
03:25:24,180 --> 03:25:25,480
And see what goes on!

4980
03:25:26,420 --> 03:25:27,940
You have to prepare the stage first...

4981
03:25:27,940 --> 03:25:29,380
And wake the boss up to fight him.

4982
03:25:32,960 --> 03:25:33,360
I...

4983
03:25:34,180 --> 03:25:34,860
Warden hurts?

4984
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:35,720
What happened to you?

4985
03:25:38,440 --> 03:25:39,200
He's awake?

4986
03:25:39,680 --> 03:25:40,840
Wait, why is he awake?

4987
03:25:45,530 --> 03:25:46,010
Wait.

4988
03:25:46,250 --> 03:25:47,610
How is he alive right now?

4989
03:25:48,430 --> 03:25:48,730
Uh-oh.

4990
03:25:50,630 --> 03:25:51,110
Um...

4991
03:25:51,110 --> 03:25:51,470
Wait.

4992
03:25:51,690 --> 03:25:52,210
I think...

4993
03:25:52,210 --> 03:25:53,230
My game...

4994
03:25:53,830 --> 03:25:55,310
Oh, he's awake inside the thing.

4995
03:25:57,910 --> 03:25:58,390
Okay.

4996
03:26:01,370 --> 03:26:02,410
He takes notice.

4997
03:26:02,610 --> 03:26:02,830
Uh-oh.

4998
03:26:03,530 --> 03:26:04,130
But I'm...

4999
03:26:04,130 --> 03:26:04,730
I'm sneaking!

5000
03:26:06,230 --> 03:26:07,690
Put all the armor on you, right?

5001
03:26:12,210 --> 03:26:13,450
Why is he alive?

5002
03:26:20,550 --> 03:26:21,270
Uh-oh.

5003
03:26:21,550 --> 03:26:21,870
Uh-oh.

5004
03:26:22,030 --> 03:26:23,430
I did say...

5005
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:30,370
The villagers make noise.

5006
03:26:30,450 --> 03:26:31,230
That's how it's supposed to be.

5007
03:26:31,390 --> 03:26:31,890
Ah, I see.

5008
03:26:32,110 --> 03:26:32,850
Are they going to kill him?

5009
03:26:33,030 --> 03:26:34,070
Or is he going to kill them?

5010
03:26:53,780 --> 03:26:54,580
Oh, shoot!

5011
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:56,720
I died.

5012
03:27:01,350 --> 03:27:01,950
I died.

5013
03:27:06,510 --> 03:27:07,210
I died.

5014
03:27:11,790 --> 03:27:13,390
If I go back in...

5015
03:27:14,410 --> 03:27:15,910
It was sadly lost.

5016
03:27:16,050 --> 03:27:16,510
Oh, my God!

5017
03:27:16,630 --> 03:27:17,530
Look at all my stuff!

5018
03:27:21,930 --> 03:27:22,650
Oh, God.

5019
03:27:23,190 --> 03:27:23,690
Oh, God.

5020
03:27:23,890 --> 03:27:25,470
When it starts getting dark...

5021
03:27:25,470 --> 03:27:26,030
Okay.

5022
03:27:26,170 --> 03:27:27,870
So, this is how it's supposed to be.

5023
03:27:29,190 --> 03:27:29,870
Ah!

5024
03:27:30,310 --> 03:27:30,670
I'm passing!

5025
03:27:30,910 --> 03:27:31,670
Chicken jockey!

5026
03:27:34,190 --> 03:27:34,870
Ah!

5027
03:27:53,980 --> 03:27:55,220
Thank you, everybody.

5028
03:27:58,120 --> 03:27:58,800
For...

5029
03:28:00,640 --> 03:28:02,720
For more craft mine today.

5030
03:28:02,980 --> 03:28:03,520
This is fun.

5031
03:28:05,720 --> 03:28:06,400
Um...

5032
03:28:07,560 --> 03:28:08,780
Goodness gracious.

5033
03:28:14,360 --> 03:28:17,940
I have another stream today with Dookie Bird.

5034
03:28:18,240 --> 03:28:19,500
I will be on her channel.

5035
03:28:20,420 --> 03:28:22,380
I don't know if I can say the whole time.

5036
03:28:22,600 --> 03:28:26,840
So, she might have to be extra brave today to get through everything.

5037
03:28:27,400 --> 03:28:33,320
So that we can get through the chapter.

5038
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:37,260
Because I have, like I said, I have my meeting with the 3D studio tonight.

5039
03:28:37,260 --> 03:28:38,560
So, it's important.

5040
03:28:42,680 --> 03:28:43,080
Yeah.

5041
03:28:44,100 --> 03:28:45,240
Yeah, Dookie Bird.

5042
03:28:45,460 --> 03:28:46,280
Yeah, Dookie Bird.

5043
03:28:50,320 --> 03:28:51,120
So, um...

5044
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:53,460
We're going to have to make sure she's extra brave today.

5045
03:28:53,500 --> 03:28:54,000
Okay, guys?

5046
03:28:55,340 --> 03:28:57,020
If you're going to come watch...

5047
03:28:57,020 --> 03:28:57,760
I stream a POV?

5048
03:28:57,860 --> 03:28:58,120
No, no.

5049
03:28:58,180 --> 03:28:59,160
It's a one-player game.

5050
03:28:59,360 --> 03:29:00,340
So, uh...

5051
03:29:00,340 --> 03:29:00,600
Yeah.

5052
03:29:00,740 --> 03:29:01,500
It's on her channel.

5053
03:29:02,560 --> 03:29:03,360
It's just, uh...

5054
03:29:03,360 --> 03:29:05,460
I'm just there for moral support, pretty much.

5055
03:29:07,360 --> 03:29:07,680
Anyway!

5056
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:09,780
Thank you guys for hanging out with me.

5057
03:29:09,940 --> 03:29:12,400
And I will see you guys when I see you next.

5058
03:29:12,880 --> 03:29:13,540
And, uh...

5059
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:16,320
And...

5060
03:29:16,320 --> 03:29:16,800
And...

5061
03:29:17,700 --> 03:29:18,020
And...

5062
03:29:19,360 --> 03:29:19,680
And...

5063
03:29:19,680 --> 03:29:20,840
Rate her waiting room.

5064
03:29:20,960 --> 03:29:22,040
Oh, I guess we can do that, right?

5065
03:29:22,160 --> 03:29:23,000
Let me put it up.

5066
03:29:23,140 --> 03:29:24,500
So, for anybody who wants to watch...

5067
03:29:26,380 --> 03:29:26,700
Um...

5068
03:29:27,760 --> 03:29:28,360
Dookie Bird.

5069
03:29:28,620 --> 03:29:29,660
Oh, she does have a waiting room up.

5070
03:29:29,800 --> 03:29:30,060
Okay, perfect.

5071
03:29:31,780 --> 03:29:32,100
Wingmaid.

5072
03:29:33,340 --> 03:29:33,660
Yeah.

5073
03:29:34,160 --> 03:29:34,780
Thanks for having us.

5074
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:35,700
Craftmine is a blast.

5075
03:29:35,840 --> 03:29:36,060
And, yeah.

5076
03:29:36,160 --> 03:29:37,760
It will be fun to see how Dookie deals.

5077
03:29:37,960 --> 03:29:40,120
I don't know how many more Craftmines I'll do.

5078
03:29:41,140 --> 03:29:41,460
Um...

5079
03:29:41,460 --> 03:29:41,800
I don't know.

5080
03:29:41,860 --> 03:29:43,100
Maybe every once in a while.

5081
03:29:43,160 --> 03:29:44,220
I probably won't do them weekly.

5082
03:29:44,900 --> 03:29:46,980
Maybe just, like, kind of when I feel like it.

5083
03:29:47,400 --> 03:29:48,720
We can do a Craftmine.

5084
03:29:50,300 --> 03:29:51,660
When I don't know...

5085
03:29:52,760 --> 03:29:53,440
What to play.

5086
03:29:56,120 --> 03:29:56,540
So, yeah.

5087
03:29:56,900 --> 03:29:58,100
Thank you, guys.

5088
03:29:58,340 --> 03:29:58,560
Thank you.

5089
03:29:58,660 --> 03:29:59,000
Have a good day.

5090
03:29:59,140 --> 03:29:59,400
Have a good day.

5091
03:29:59,520 --> 03:30:01,160
And I'll see you later.

5092
03:30:01,720 --> 03:30:02,240
Bye-bye.

5093
03:30:02,500 --> 03:30:02,780
Bye-bye.

5094
03:30:02,900 --> 03:30:03,200
Bye-bye.

5095
03:30:03,200 --> 03:30:03,580
Bye-bye.

5096
03:30:04,100 --> 03:30:04,380
Bye-bye.
