1
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,720
Swap.

2
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,120
Swap.

3
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,540
You threw me off the groove.

4
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,920
I was like, you're not supposed to talk back.

5
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm here too!

6
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,500
Hello guys.

7
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,700
Okay, so you guys might see like this little... sorry, I looped the intro because Min and I were sharing secrets.

8
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,600
We were sharing secrets.

9
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,920
You're not invited.

10
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,400
They're really good secrets.

11
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,340
Yeah, if only you could have heard what we said.

12
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,140
You would never ever.

13
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,780
You'll never know.

14
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,180
You're gonna miss the FOMO.

15
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,060
Wait, no, didn't they want the FOMO?

16
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,940
You have FOMO.

17
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,680
Oh, you have FOMO.

18
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,100
What could we have said?

19
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,320
Oh my god.

20
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,820
Within like five minutes.

21
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,940
I'm gonna tell them right now.

22
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,820
Because it's about you, so it's your secret.

23
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Wait, don't you tell me stuff too?

24
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,200
But the later half was your secret.

25
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,280
Oh yeah, first half was Doki's secrets and then later was my secrets.

26
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,900
Yeah, so there's two secrets that you don't know.

27
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,780
Two whole secrets.

28
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,220
Oh my god.

29
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,020
Two whole secrets that you were not there for.

30
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,400
How long are we gonna drag on this video?

31
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,680
We gotta give them all the FOMO.

32
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,440
Now that we're in these, we don't have to deal with FOMO anymore.

33
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,340
So we give you FOMO instead.

34
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
We give you FOMO.

35
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,180
We can do whatever we want.

36
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah.

37
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,520
Okay, so if you guys don't see the bottom right text on my end, I don't know if you're showing it, Mint.

38
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,760
Oh, I can move myself.

39
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,560
But it says, warning, this version may cause the game to crash.

40
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,100
So it's not our PC.

41
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,680
It might be a Kuso game.

42
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,260
I don't know.

43
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,200
Yeah, it might be.

44
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,600
It might be a Kuso game.

45
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,160
It says, your decision.

46
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,280
Yeah, I suggested the game.

47
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:55,700
Okay, so, um, so this game, I told Mint that she has to start a new game herself as well.

48
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:55,980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

49
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,200
So like, cause I, cause there's an intro to the game.

50
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,740
So don't click multiplayer, right?

51
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,280
Click new game?

52
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,080
Yeah, don't click, just do new game, and then you do normal, and then you'll be met with like an intro.

53
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,020
Anyway, so those who don't know what Hospital 666 is, it's basically like that, uh, was it Platform 8?

54
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,500
Subway?

56
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,880
So it's basically Platform 8.

57
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,420
But, or Exit 8.

58
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,240
Sorry, Exit 8.

59
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,080
It's basically Exit 8, but what if we added multiplayer in there?

60
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
How do you even do that?

61
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,040
I don't even know.

62
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,480
We're gonna find out now.

63
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,900
I wonder if it's like 666 floors.

64
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,620
There's 666 floors.

65
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
How long is this?

66
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,680
How long?

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,240
We're gonna be playing up until Doki's new model, you guys.

68
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,860
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,300
Into the new skin suit.

70
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,260
Yeah, this is 24 hours.

71
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,300
24 hours, by the way.

72
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,520
Surprise!

73
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,820
Surprise!

74
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,440
You know like the spookies, the jump scare mansion?

75
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,980
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

77
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,480
We're gonna make it to floor a thousand, guys!

78
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,980
Is that actually how long that game is?

79
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,380
No way.

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,040
Oh, yeah, the spookies.

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,620
Have you ever played the jump scare one?

82
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,220
No, no.

83
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Oh, yeah, I think it is.

84
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,020
I think it's like, uh, I think it is.

85
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,940
I played it before.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,660
It's up to like a thousand floors.

87
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,460
What the hell?

88
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:24,080
Cause like every hundred you get, it's like a new like a new theme to the to the like rooms and stuff.

89
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,620
So it gets spookier and spookier.

90
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,280
Okay.

91
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,620
Um, and at one point one of them was like, uh, at one point you go to a floor that's just a fucking maze.

92
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,860
Someone said a thousand floors plus bonus DLC floors.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,700
They made more floors?

94
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,620
No, it's, oh wait, yeah, they made more floors.

95
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,340
Yeah, there's DLC floors too.

96
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,900
And there's like, and then like you get taken to like a hospital too.

97
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,840
It's like spookies and hospital.

98
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:59,740
Oh, yeah, and then I also while we were like waiting for the stream, um, I linked Mint a really good

99
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,160
I linked Mint a Vtuber background and I was like oh my god, it's perfect.

100
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,580
It's so, it's the best It's actually, I should have used it today, man.

101
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,140
Honestly, you should have.

102
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,300
No, that's what they want!

103
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,060
That's what the Wisp want!

104
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,780
That background?

105
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,120
Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll, I'm gonna link it to my chat.

106
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,780
We

107
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,060
I'll link it to my chat too.

108
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:41,720
And then you being like you can recreate that Dr. Horrible seal Bro, everybody loves it!

109
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,120
Helping that random girl you see at the laundromat roleplay.

110
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,420
It's like, it's like the, one of the top five cliches out there.

111
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,000
Top five dreams.

112
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,640
It's true.

113
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:51,740
It's true.

114
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,660
We could be that girl.

115
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,500
Yeah.

116
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,500
Oh my god.

117
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,780
There's this, there's this ghost maid in my laundromat.

118
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,360
My laundromat's haunted!

119
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh, spooky!

120
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,200
Oh, spooky!

121
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,580
Because it was like, who wants this?

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
I was like, what do you mean, who wants this?

123
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,140
No, no, no, I said, what led to them creating?

124
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Like, what was the demand?

125
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,280
Like, who said, man, I really need like a laundromat?

126
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,220
Like, right now.

127
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,140
He saw a random girl at the laundromat.

128
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,040
He's like, well, that could be if only VTubers had this too.

129
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,840
Not enough anime start with a guy meeting a girl at the laundromat.

130
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm telling you.

131
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,260
He's like, no, he's like, you know, like, the west version of weeaboos?

132
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,540
The west-a-boo?

133
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,120
Yeah, the west-a-boos!

134
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,460
I bet you the person who created it is a west-a-boo because they saw too many like, American TV shows where it starts off the laundromat.

135
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,840
He's a west-a-boo!

136
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
He wishes Japan has more of this!

137
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,160
I'm gonna throw chat in the laundry machine.

138
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,380
I'm gonna throw you guys in.

139
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,100
The perfect RP.

140
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:11,400
I would make it so that the chat is like, the laundromat's like, overlaid on top of chat and then you guys are spinning it.

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,780
That's too much work for me.

142
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,780
I won't be doing it.

143
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,380
Okay, I'll do it, guys.

144
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,540
Yeah, yeah, check Minthe channels out if you want to live your laundromat fantasies.

145
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,020
Wow!

146
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,260
See, that's why I linked you the background.

147
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,980
I knew you'd You knew it was made for me!

148
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,780
I knew it was made for you!

149
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,660
This background's made for you!

150
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,480
Okay, guys, how's our volume, by the way?

151
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:38,940
Yeah.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,500
After all that.

153
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,980
I'm gonna start a new game.

154
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,060
Yeah, we're gonna start a new game, too.

155
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,040
You guys gotta see the intro.

156
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,100
Do I just do any difficulty?

157
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,480
Yeah, any difficulty and then we'll hook.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,080
Or do normal, yeah.

159
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,300
Okay, I'm starting the game.

160
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,340
Go some balls!

161
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,100
Wait, is this...

162
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,180
This is not game footage, this is a real footage.

163
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,380
Yeah, this is the dev.

164
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,660
What is going on?

165
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,540
Go some balls!

166
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,160
Oh my god, he's so mad.

167
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
And now, we're in the game!

168
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,660
That was it?

169
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,120
Yeah, that was it.

170
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
That's what I wanted you to see.

171
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,020
I was like, what the fuck is this?

172
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,280
Now you're in the game, too.

173
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:28,880
Oh my god.

174
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
All these instructions.

175
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,860
They have, like, the entire world.

176
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,160
Wait, is he a VTuber?

177
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,740
Yeah, yeah, he's apparently, like, um...

178
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,300
Guys, by the way, guys, this developer is single.

179
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,620
So, ladies and guys, too.

180
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,340
Wait, should I turn VSync on or off?

181
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't remember.

182
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,860
Bro, I don't know.

183
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,520
Okay.

184
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,340
She asked me if she should play on DX11 or Go, and she was like, what's the difference?

185
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,280
And I was like, I don't know.

186
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,220
Well, turning it on helped me not lag, so...

187
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,240
Okay, that's good.

188
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,180
Okay, I'm returning to the menu.

189
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,560
Alright, also, sound guy, turn mint up a bit more.

190
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,300
Is it better now?

191
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,340
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

192
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,360
Blah, blah, blah.

193
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,080
Alright, let me, I'll invite you.

194
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,280
Let me go to the multiplayer.

195
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,320
Okay.

196
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,420
Host, cause I don't know, did you start it off on easy?

197
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
No, I did normal.

198
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:26,880
Okay.

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
I couldn't tell.

200
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Cause you were like, oops.

201
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,660
And I was like, oh no, what do you mean, oops?

202
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,760
Alright.

203
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,260
Alright.

204
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,480
How do I invite you?

205
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,200
Can you give me a sec?

206
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,580
Oh, the friends list is like, empty for me.

207
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,340
Oh, okay.

208
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,780
So... This is fine.

209
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,040
That should be fine, right?

210
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:50,900
Alright.

211
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,940
I can invite you to watch this game.

212
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,640
Wait, can you go to multiplayer and see if you find me in the game?

213
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
No, you're not there.

214
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,780
I'm not there?

215
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,080
Okay.

216
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,000
I have no friends.

217
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,720
I have no friends.

218
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,600
Oh, okay.

219
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,820
No, I meant like, you know how you go to multiplayer?

220
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,980
Do I show up on multiplayer?

221
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,180
No.

222
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,900
I don't?

223
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,280
Okay, this is awkward.

224
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,840
What if I press host?

225
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,600
Oh.

226
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,440
Well, if you're hosting then I can join you.

227
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,700
Yeah, try me, try me.

228
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,420
Okay, give me a sound.

229
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,280
Alright, return to menu.

230
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,580
Refresh, refresh.

231
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,840
Why don't you exist on my friends list?

232
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,360
See, that's what I'm saying!

233
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,220
Wait, can you invite me?

234
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,660
Uh...

235
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,400
Uh...

236
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,620
Uh...

237
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,880
You guys, we're not professionals, okay?

238
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,420
We're indie vtubers, please.

239
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,840
You have to have zero expectations on us.

240
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,860
We're indie vtubers, please understand.

241
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,460
Please understand.

242
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,840
It is just us right now.

243
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,580
We're not professionals.

244
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,960
We should not be put up to standards when it comes to corporate vtubers.

245
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,180
We're just one person.

246
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,960
I say when I have a team bond.

247
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,740
I say when I have a team bond.

248
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,460
Well, I don't.

249
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,400
So I can actually, it's just me, myself, and I.

250
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,220
How do I invite friends?

251
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay, hold on.

252
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,080
I can invite to watch.

253
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,720
I can watch you.

254
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,800
How do I invite you?

255
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,280
I boosted her volume again.

256
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,900
Sound guy.

257
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,920
How do I join you?

258
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,500
Uh oh.

259
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,280
Uh oh.

260
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,760
Guys, give us a sec.

261
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,340
Instead of, you know, we met up 15 minutes before the stream started and instead of preparing the stream, we were sharing secrets.

262
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,660
We were sharing secrets.

263
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,440
Oh my god.

264
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,280
We had our priorities.

265
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,920
It was a juicy good secret.

266
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,040
If you knew the secret, you would have been like, good choice.

267
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,840
You know?

268
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,960
Okay, I'm gonna do friends.

269
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm gonna change my profile settings and see if you can invite me now.

270
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,720
Okay.

271
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,960
You see me on, I think you see me on VTube Studios instead of Hospital.

272
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,640
Oh, wait.

273
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm gonna return to the menu.

274
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,080
Yeah.

275
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm gonna multiplayer.

276
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,140
I'm gonna, I'll host.

277
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,080
I'm gonna host a game.

278
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,220
I don't think if you host it, you show up, right?

279
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,780
And then, um, no, it should be.

280
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,260
Cause like, what's the point of hosting it if you don't like, what's the point of hosting it?

281
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,780
How did the other people No, there's no way other VTubers were able to test this out.

282
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:35,980
That's true.

283
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,940
We can't be as, we can't be stupider than other VTubers.

284
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,000
I guess we can, Dokie.

285
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,620
Yes, we can.

286
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,880
No, we can't.

287
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,540
There's no way.

288
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,640
There's no way.

289
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,300
All VTubers have like almost equivalent IQ.

290
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,260
Wait, how do you add or how do you invite someone on Steam?

291
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,400
I never know.

292
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,420
Wait, what?

293
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
That's what I was telling you to do.

294
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
How do I do that?

295
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,740
Shift tab.

296
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,480
Shift tab.

297
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,560
Nothing showed up.

298
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,700
Oh, just kidding, just kidding.

299
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,660
Have you never done shift tab before?

300
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:19,900
No.

301
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,280
What do you mean you've never?

302
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,620
Now how do I add you?

303
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:35,700
Alright, you see where Dokie bird is, and then you go to invite.

304
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,360
Oh, I can invite you to watch.

305
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,680
But it's not even watch the game, it's watch me, Bridger.

306
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,740
I mean, don't you want to watch my face?

307
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,980
The whole time?

308
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,600
The whole time, definitely.

309
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,300
We both have like a solo session of Hospital 666.

310
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,320
And we're just watching.

311
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,760
Like we sync up our Hospital 666 gameplay together.

312
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,000
Obviously.

313
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,980
Or like see who gets to the most floors.

314
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,760
We can make it a competition.

315
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,860
Oooooh.

316
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm gonna start my game.

317
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,760
Maybe it's not us.

318
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,060
Guys, maybe it's not us.

319
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,300
We need to play in DX mode.

320
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,200
Oh, did we actually have to play in DX mode?

321
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,960
I don't know.

322
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,040
Oh, I got an achievement for leaving the game.

323
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,680
Oh, okay.

324
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,480
Okay, guys.

325
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,420
We got this.

326
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,320
We can do this, guys.

327
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,500
We can have chat.

328
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,380
No, it's good chat.

329
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,020
You guys get more content.

330
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,660
We could have ended earlier if we didn't have this.

331
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,700
I'm ending the stream right now.

332
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,300
Okay, I'm hosting again.

333
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,720
Okay, hold on.

334
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,080
Wait, are you on DX11?

335
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,660
I'm on DX11, yeah.

336
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,780
Okay, I'm on the normal one.

337
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,160
So I don't know if that affects anything.

338
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,180
Okay, can you see mine?

339
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,760
I see you!

340
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,320
I see you!

341
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,500
Oh my god, it was DX11 all along!

342
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,540
I'm joining.

343
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,760
Hopefully it doesn't crash because it said that this version...

344
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm in the floor.

345
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,600
You're on the floor?

346
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,440
I don't see you.

347
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,780
No, I'm in the floor.

348
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,800
Wait, you're in the floor?

349
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,520
Where are you?

350
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
I hear noises.

351
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,700
Where are you?

352
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,620
I hear you.

353
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,620
I see you walking on top of you.

354
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,940
I think I hear you walking.

355
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,480
Wait, go towards the man with the hat.

356
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,160
Can I see you?

357
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,200
Go towards the man with the hat.

358
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,280
Okay, can you see me?

359
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,480
I'm stuck in the floor.

360
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm gonna leave you.

361
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,280
Go to the next floor!

362
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,480
Yeah, go to the next floor.

363
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,300
Wait, remember I said layout.

364
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,500
This is what it looks like.

365
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,240
Figure it out!

366
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,440
This is a default!

367
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,120
Figure it out then!

368
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,500
Okay, okay.

369
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm gonna leave you.

370
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:54,740
Goodbye.

371
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,300
Goodbye.

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,660
I see the doors closing.

373
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,140
Where are you?

374
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm still stuck in the floor.

375
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,800
Are you on the next story?

376
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm on the next story.

377
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,380
Did you come back?

378
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm going up another floor.

379
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,520
I'm gonna go back up another floor.

380
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,520
Are you still on the first floor?

381
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,600
I can't even exit to the menu.

382
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,520
Pressing escape does nothing.

383
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,520
I'm still on the second floor.

384
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,180
Okay, I'm leaving the game.

385
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,360
I'm gonna start a new game.

386
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,060
Okay.

387
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,720
Okay, I'll join you.

388
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,540
I'll join you.

389
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,240
Maybe that'll work.

390
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,960
Okay, okay.

391
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,160
I'm not doing the DX.

392
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm joining normal.

393
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,880
Okay, I'm hosting.

394
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,960
Okay.

395
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,920
Sound guy, I turned down mint a little bit.

396
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,540
Is it better now?

397
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,540
We're still adjusting sound while figuring out how to play this game.

398
00:19:59,660 --> 00:19:59,900
It's okay.

399
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,240
It's okay.

400
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,840
We're in these guys.

401
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,620
We're in these.

402
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,520
We're in these guys.

403
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,000
We're in these guys.

404
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,420
Okay, can you see me in the game?

405
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,340
Okay.

406
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:12,960
No.

407
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,260
I don't see you in the game.

408
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,580
No, I do not.

409
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,100
Wait, how did you see me?

410
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,920
Maybe it was the DX mode.

411
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,780
I'm telling you, man.

412
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,700
I'll go on DX mode.

413
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,420
We'll swap.

414
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,680
We'll just try hosting again.

415
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,320
Okay, I'll do DX mode.

416
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,580
This is so great, you guys.

417
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Guys, we are professionals here.

418
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
This is all because we didn't even test it.

419
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
You have to see the new game intro.

420
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,020
That is not true.

421
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,980
We didn't test it because I showed her the laundromat.

422
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,940
Get it right.

423
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
Sorry, my bad.

424
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,440
You're right.

425
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,840
There's a sequence of events that led to this.

426
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,620
Are you in the game yet?

427
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,180
I'm in the game, yeah.

428
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,640
Okay, because I don't see you.

429
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,280
Maybe it's because you're...

430
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,820
Oh, wait.

431
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,360
Hold on.

432
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,580
Hold on.

433
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm hosting.

434
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,420
I'm hosting.

435
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,460
Oh, okay.

436
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:08,980
Okay.

437
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,560
I also have another idea.

438
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,360
I think it's because your Steam is on...

439
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,880
You don't show what game you're playing on Steam.

440
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
Because I've made mine friends only.

441
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,880
So you should make yours friends only.

442
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,800
And then after the stream, we private it.

443
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,280
How do you do that?

444
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,700
What do you mean?

445
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,400
That's...

446
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,020
Okay.

447
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,800
You know...

448
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,640
What did you learn in the last three years?

449
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,500
What did you learn in the last three years?

450
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,780
What did you learn in the last three years?

451
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,600
What do you mean?

452
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,720
Okay.

453
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,420
Okay.

454
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,940
Go to...

455
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,680
Go to Steam.

456
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,640
Click your name.

457
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,840
Click your name.

458
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,820
Go to privacy settings.

459
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:56,900
Hold on.

460
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,600
Where is...

461
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:57,900
Hold on.

462
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,160
Click...

463
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,520
Wait.

464
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,580
Under my profile?

465
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,740
Okay.

466
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,540
You go to...

467
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:03,700
Yeah.

468
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,400
Go to...

469
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,520
Tokyo.

470
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,040
Go to Tokyo.

471
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,320
Go to edit profile.

472
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,260
Okay.

473
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,360
Oh, privacy settings.

474
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,740
Yeah.

475
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,320
And then friends only.

476
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,020
Oh, my God.

477
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,580
Oh, my God.

478
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,040
No way that actually fixed it.

479
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,640
No way.

480
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,640
Oh, my God.

481
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,980
I can see you now.

482
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,640
Oh, my God.

483
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,120
Oh, my God.

484
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,400
Come on.

485
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,580
Come on.

486
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:30,720
Come on.

487
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,120
Join the game.

488
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,040
Oh, there you are.

489
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,280
Oh, there you are.

490
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,260
Oh, my God.

491
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,840
It was the Steam thing all over again.

492
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,980
I can't believe you learned this as an indie.

493
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,560
I can't believe you learned this as an indie.

494
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm just getting my feet off the ground.

495
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,660
I've been around for two months.

496
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,340
Come on.

497
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,120
Give me a break.

498
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,240
You...

499
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,340
You...

500
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,640
You...

501
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,760
You can't say that.

502
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,000
You existed five years ago.

503
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,540
You can't say that.

504
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,560
You can't say that.

505
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,820
When I existed, you existed.

506
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,500
When I existed, you existed.

507
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,200
When we were both indies.

508
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,800
You can't say that.

509
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,120
Okay.

510
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,020
You know what, Doki?

511
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,840
You need to shave.

512
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,360
Okay?

513
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:16,960
Come on.

514
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,680
Come on.

515
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,660
Get out of my way.

516
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:18,660
Come on.

517
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,260
Get out of my way.

518
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,340
I'm ready to get out of this hospital.

519
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,940
Oh, my God.

520
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,840
Did you hear that?

521
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,480
Can we open the door?

522
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
How do you open the door?

523
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,740
I don't think we can.

524
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:31,980
Okay.

525
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,840
I don't think we're allowed to.

526
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,640
Oh, wait.

527
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,000
That's us.

528
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,020
That's our Triplet.

529
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,520
We're visiting a Triplet at the hospital.

530
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,920
Solid Liquid Solid.

531
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:41,860
Alright.

532
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,300
We've got to memorize this layout.

533
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,720
We've got to figure out what the anomalies are later.

534
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,160
Okay.

535
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,240
Look at that.

536
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,600
Wait.

537
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,440
I heard that there's a thing I can do in multiplayer.

538
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,540
Can I do it?

539
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,400
Oh, I...

540
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,100
Yeah.

541
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,540
Yeah.

542
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,460
Yeah.

543
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,180
Yeah.

544
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,620
Yeah.

545
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:00,780
Yeah.

546
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,840
Yeah.

547
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,340
Yeah.

548
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,400
Yeah.

549
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Yeah.

550
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Yeah.

551
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

552
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

553
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

554
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

555
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

556
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

557
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:01,720
Yeah.

558
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Yeah.

559
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Yeah.

560
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,320
That's where you want to get beat up, in the hospital.

561
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,760
Don't make me press the button!

562
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,820
I'm in here, I'm in here too!

563
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,140
Slamming the button.

564
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,480
I'm gonna punch you in the balls, that's what I'm gonna do.

565
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,860
No, I'm gonna punch you first!

566
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,420
Oh yeah!

567
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,120
Yeah!

568
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,280
Are you gonna make it to the elevator?

569
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,080
First one there is running!

570
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,760
Oh yeah, push me back to the elevator!

571
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,500
Come on!

572
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm gonna make it before you!

573
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:35,960
No!

574
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,540
Give me it!

575
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,120
No!

576
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,480
Wait, wait, wait.

577
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
No, I can't!

578
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,140
You can't punch me from the elevator!

579
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,580
Yes you can!

580
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,780
I'm punching your...

581
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,060
I like how we are not checking the anomalies.

582
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,840
We're back to floor zero.

583
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,100
Wait, what do you mean we're back to floor zero?

584
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,460
What happened?

585
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,640
Look at the elevator!

586
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,120
What do you mean what happened?

587
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,240
What do you mean?

588
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,100
But we're advancing!

589
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,700
Look at the elevator!

590
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,180
Oh dude, I have to play the game!

591
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:02,660
Oh!

592
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,860
Boo boo.

593
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,760
Boo boo.

594
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,200
Dammit, I can't leave you.

595
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,800
I haven't been to the floor.

596
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,700
All right.

597
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,820
I don't think there's any anomalies.

598
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,920
Wait, are you getting coffee?

599
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,620
Yeah.

600
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,680
Not for you.

601
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,220
Why get coffee when we can get GamerSubs?

602
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,740
I saw it.

603
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,180
Anyway guys, did you guys know that we both have GamerSubs codes?

604
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,900
We both have codes!

605
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:27,920
Yeah!

606
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,400
Anyway, feel free to use a Doughkeeper.

607
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,700
We both have codes!

608
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:40,800
Or Boomer, which is the cooler, more trendy code to use.

609
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,880
Or the link in the description.

610
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,080
Link in the description.

611
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,060
There's no link in your description.

612
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,620
Yes, there is!

613
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,160
Yes, there is!

614
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,280
I'm getting to the elevator first!

615
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,540
Wait, wait.

616
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,600
Wait a minute.

617
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,220
What?

618
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,800
Oh, we were... Wait, you are!

619
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,320
Okay.

620
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,600
Wait a minute.

621
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,700
Wait, I think there's a nominee here.

622
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,520
You think so?

623
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,720
Yeah, I think so.

624
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,500
What is it?

625
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,600
I don't think there is two cats.

626
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,300
You can't even press the button!

627
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,540
You can't even go!

628
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,680
No!

629
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,480
I can't do it!

630
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,920
What's the point?

631
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,960
We have to find the anomaly.

632
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,720
Come on.

633
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,840
I don't know.

634
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,140
Everything looks the same.

635
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,420
Wait, isn't he on the other side?

636
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,800
He's backwards.

637
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,600
No, he was always here.

638
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
No, because like...

639
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,060
This is where we start off.

640
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,980
Because this is where you got coffee, remember?

641
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,820
Oh, you're right.

642
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,160
You're right.

643
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,480
Yeah, and then you're like...

644
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,440
Go over here and you're like...

645
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,560
There's all the medicine.

646
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,000
There's this beautiful vista.

647
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,280
Alright, let me read the rules.

648
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,100
You find anomaly, press the L button.

649
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,980
Let me read the rules.

650
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,080
It's 30 minutes into this stream.

651
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,620
We played this game for 5 minutes.

652
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,500
20 minutes of this game with text support.

653
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,080
Okay, if you don't find the anomaly, press the button from the another elevator.

654
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,780
Oh, from the elevator over on this side.

655
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,580
So if we don't find the anomaly, we just gotta...

656
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,560
Oh, we come back here?

657
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,740
You can use the top button to review the previous floor.

659
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Orange light outside means you're starting from this elevator.

660
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,400
Oh, okay, so it tells you like which elevator you start from.

661
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,980
Wait, no, if you don't find an anomaly, press the button from another...

662
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,480
Oh, so if we find an anomaly, we come here.

663
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,320
If we don't find an anomaly, we go over there.

664
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,820
It's wherever, it's whatever elevator you start with.

665
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,780
Yeah.

666
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Because both elevators have the same instruction.

667
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,720
So if we find an anomaly, we go up a floor.

668
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,540
I don't think you're, like, or like...

669
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,040
We go, if we find one, we go here.

670
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,820
If we don't find one, we go down there.

671
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,300
No, we press the, yeah, yeah.

674
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
No, it's because there's a restart.

675
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,100
There's a...

676
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,180
No, that's if you want to go back to the previous floor.

677
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:56,940
Oh!

678
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,520
Guys, see, we can lean.

679
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,340
Okay, do you think there's an anomaly?

680
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
No, I think so, I think we're good.

681
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,220
Okay, hold on, there's five, six doors.

682
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
Two, four, six.

683
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,260
Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six.

684
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:14,620
Okay.

685
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,140
That's what I said.

686
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,540
I don't know, I'm worried you couldn't count, you know.

687
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:18,860
Okay.

688
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,540
Because we're VTubers.

689
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,740
They care about our health.

690
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,500
Yeah, there's, like, lots of meds here.

691
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,380
Guys, remember to take your meds.

692
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,820
That's all of Doki's meds right there.

693
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Yeah, and that...

694
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,080
Yeah, yeah, Mitt's meds is in this room.

695
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,780
It's an entire room dedicated to her meds.

696
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,060
Okay, okay.

697
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,240
This one is so that she can count.

698
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,760
This one's so she can read.

699
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,060
This one is...

700
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,340
Wait, I can't beat you up anymore.

701
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:46,800
This one's so that my imaginary...

702
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,020
What happened?

703
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,920
Oh, no, I need to take my meds.

704
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,440
I've lost control of my arms.

705
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,400
This one is so my imaginary friend will finally disappear.

706
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,120
But I didn't take it.

707
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,120
That's why it's all here.

708
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,840
Why can't I punch you?

709
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,680
All right, let's just go up and see what happens.

710
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,160
Because I didn't take my meds.

711
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,060
All right.

712
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,820
We go...

713
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
We go up.

714
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,440
I think we're...

715
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:10,980
I think we're good.

716
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,360
What's that?

717
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,700
All right, we'll see.

718
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,320
It's gonna go to two.

719
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,060
It's gonna go to two?

720
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:16,820
Yeah.

721
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,820
It's not moving.

722
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh, what the hell?

723
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,120
Oh, it's back to zero.

724
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,560
I knew we fucked it up.

725
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,920
There's no...

726
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,100
There's no...

727
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,800
It was...

728
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,860
What did we mess up?

729
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,660
Okay.

730
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:29,960
Wait.

731
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,680
So this is zero.

732
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,560
So we can figure out what is all...

733
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

734
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,680
Okay.

735
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,400
So water.

736
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,160
Okay.

737
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,120
Exit side.

738
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,140
The meds are still here.

739
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,100
Water.

740
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,320
Yeah.

741
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,760
All right.

742
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,180
There's two trash cans.

743
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,440
There's two fires.

744
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,360
Did you count the six doors?

745
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,260
Did you count...

746
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,500
Yes, I counted the six doors.

747
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,400
I just wanted to be sure.

748
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,480
Okay.

749
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,020
It's cast.

750
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,080
Okay.

751
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,140
So, cafe cappuccino.

752
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,260
Waterfalls.

753
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,860
Cafe con...

754
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,240
What's it called?

755
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,120
Panal.

756
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Panal.

757
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,700
All right.

758
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,080
I think we can go up the floor.

759
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,560
Okay.

760
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,960
I think this is what...

761
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,480
Maybe the side.

762
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,340
I think this is what patient zero looks like.

763
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,320
Maybe the side.

764
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,520
Yeah.

765
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,100
Maybe the side.

766
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,340
One.

767
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,020
One.

768
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,120
We can pay attention.

769
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,340
We are...

770
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,120
There's two of us.

771
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,140
Like, this is a...

772
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,240
Yeah.

773
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,760
...mount of, like, five people.

774
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,080
There's two of us.

775
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,760
This is a...

776
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,540
This is a one to four player game, okay?

777
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,640
It's not our fault we're missing two players to help us.

778
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,060
Was this always here?

779
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:35,960
Yeah.

780
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,720
This was always here.

781
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,200
Okay.

782
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,520
I've seen this before.

783
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,360
Okay.

784
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,320
And there was always, like, two...

785
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:41,620
I don't trust her.

786
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,140
Okay.

787
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,840
All right.

788
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,080
Okay.

789
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,400
Then, let's stay on this elevator.

790
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,520
Let's stay over here and press the button if you don't trust me.

791
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,360
I mean, the guys...

792
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:51,820
Oh!

793
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,880
Oh, my God!

794
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,600
There's an anomaly!

795
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,120
What's the anomaly?

796
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,400
This guy is running.

797
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,560
What?

798
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,600
Oh, my God!

799
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,700
Are you sure?

800
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
Wait, what do you mean am I sure?

801
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,800
Do you not see it?

802
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,460
No.

803
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,620
He's standing still.

804
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,460
Wait, actually?

805
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,260
Yeah.

806
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,660
Are you sure?

807
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,620
Are you gaslighting me?

808
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
I have photographic proof.

809
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm glad I'm streaming this.

810
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,900
A photo means that it's a photo.

811
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,380
It's a photo!

812
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,880
It's a snapshot!

813
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,040
A photo isn't animated.

814
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,680
That proves my point.

815
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,420
No, chat.

816
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,440
I took my...

817
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,800
You guys, come on.

818
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Believe me.

819
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,020
Come on.

820
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,560
Look at him.

821
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,680
He's running!

822
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,960
No, mince chat.

823
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,360
It's not running, right?

824
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,560
Mince chat.

825
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,780
It's not running, right?

826
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,400
It is running, right?

827
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,920
It's not.

828
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,960
I don't see it.

829
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,020
I'm pretty sure...

830
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,460
I'm looking at stream right now.

831
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,260
It's not running.

832
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,820
Yes, yes!

833
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,840
You see it!

834
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,480
Use your eyes!

835
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,300
You forgot to take the meds...

836
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,480
to use your eyes.

837
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,120
I can only see it five frames per second.

838
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,180
Wait, so then that means...

839
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,500
we go back to this one, right?

840
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,660
Yeah, we go back and we go up.

841
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,260
Yeah, okay.

842
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,740
You know how...

843
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,140
some video cameras...

844
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,400
can only see certain frames?

845
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,700
And then...

846
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,480
you can actually have a video of a bird...

847
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,600
whose wings are just like...

848
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,320
Those are my eyes.

850
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,940
Okay.

851
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,960
I think you need to get help for that.

852
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,580
Oh, we're at two!

853
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,280
That was me.

854
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,900
We did not do anything.

855
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,000
I did it!

856
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,880
We did it together.

857
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,300
This is a team game.

858
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,740
It's a collab.

859
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,960
What you accomplish...

860
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,220
is what I can accomplish.

861
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,220
Oh my god.

862
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,100
And now he's green.

863
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,400
He's not running at all.

864
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,100
Alright.

865
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,760
I am looking at the calendar.

866
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,400
Medical center first.

867
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,060
Everything looks the same.

868
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,140
Everything looks the same.

869
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,320
Yeah.

870
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,220
You know what?

871
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,200
I think you know who...

872
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,460
Wait!

873
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,380
There's three clocks!

874
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,760
Wait, wasn't there always three clocks?

875
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,040
I only saw one before.

876
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,300
Maybe that was the anomaly.

877
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,640
Wait, maybe...

878
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,520
Oh, I think it is three clocks is the anomaly.

879
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,160
So we go up from here.

880
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,820
See, we're doing so good!

881
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,060
Teamwork!

882
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,380
We're doing so good, guys!

883
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,700
I think, you know what?

884
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,840
You know who can be our third and fourth player?

885
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,700
Chat.

886
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,440
Yeah, how true!

887
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,340
See!

888
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,940
Yeah!

889
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,100
One clock!

890
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,780
One clock!

891
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,940
Oh my god.

892
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,180
I think we're really good at this game.

893
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,240
This game is too easy.

894
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,780
It's not like we fucked up like three times...

895
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,820
before we figured it out.

896
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,580
The royal we.

897
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Yeah, sure.

898
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,140
I don't think there's any anomalies this time.

899
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,400
It doesn't look like it.

900
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,940
Well, you said that last time and there were three clocks!

901
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,340
Look, I didn't look behind me!

902
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,600
How many doors?

903
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,000
Doki, how many doors are there?

904
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,420
Six.

905
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,360
One, two, three, four, five, six.

906
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,520
See, I can count too.

907
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,040
She took her meds, everybody.

908
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,620
Yeah, I took my meds.

909
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:01,920
You see?

910
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,220
Up we go!

911
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,440
I can't go up a floor without you, man!

912
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,000
What the fuck?

913
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,300
Okay.

914
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,060
Don't go back to zero.

915
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,980
Wait, does it go back to zero if we lose?

916
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,420
Yeah, it goes back to zero if we lose.

917
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,360
I don't even know how many floors it's supposed to be.

918
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,100
Okay, we're at four!

919
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,140
We're doing it!

920
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,480
Alright.

921
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,080
Everything looks fine.

922
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,520
Okay, there's two fire hydrants.

923
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:38,940
Wait, wait, wait!

924
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,640
The fire hydrants!

925
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,000
There's always been two.

926
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,760
Yeah, but then look at the labels.

927
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,020
Weren't they like, together?

928
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,000
Like, the same label?

929
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,080
Oh, I don't know.

930
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,460
But also, wait, we started on the other side.

931
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,140
Is that normal?

932
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,880
No, we went here.

933
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,620
We came to this elevator because there was no anomaly.

934
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,500
So we started on that side.

935
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,120
Okay, okay, okay.

936
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,700
You're right, you're right.

937
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,180
Check the meds.

938
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,240
How many doors?

939
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,760
I said fire hydrants and you agreed with me.

940
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,260
Oh, fire extinguishers.

941
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,720
I'm in the...

942
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,260
I told you, chat!

943
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,080
There's, there's, there's, there's!

944
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,380
Oh, the water!

945
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,160
It's leaking.

946
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,400
Oh my god!

947
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,660
What's going on here?

948
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,720
Wait, okay, that's water.

949
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,480
Why is there blood here?

950
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,840
Why is there blood also here?

951
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,880
And it's old blood, too, because it's dark red.

952
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,400
Ooh.

953
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,300
Somebody, like, stubbed her toe or something.

954
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,160
I think that is a pretty extreme stubbed toe.

955
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,480
I think...

956
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,240
I think...

957
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,860
So, we go in this one, right?

958
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,340
No, we go on the other...

959
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,460
No, we go on the other one.

960
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,980
There's an anomaly.

961
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,540
I'm confused!

962
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,960
I don't remember how we did this.

963
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,100
Oh my god, the VTuber is up here now.

964
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,540
And you find the elevator.

965
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,080
Anomaly, press the button from the elevator you come from.

966
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,480
Yeah, from the elevator you come from.

967
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,620
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

968
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

969
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:05,880
See?

970
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,780
We're doing it.

971
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,080
I told you this is a team of we.

972
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,440
We.

973
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,840
We, we.

974
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,220
Alright.

975
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,540
Nice.

976
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:15,920
Nice.

977
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,380
Okay.

978
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,920
Fifth floor.

979
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,320
Chat, how many floors is this?

980
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
They don't know.

981
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,500
They probably don't know.

982
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,940
They've seen gameplay of this before.

983
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,260
Okay.

984
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,680
Alright.

985
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,640
Let's see.

986
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,500
Alright.

987
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,100
Fire extinguisher.

988
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,280
That looks fine.

989
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,080
Everything looks fine.

990
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,880
The medicine looks the same.

991
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,900
The medicine looks the same.

992
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,260
Did you see that?

993
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,020
Did you see that?

994
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,360
What was that?

995
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:44,940
Shit!

996
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,220
Get away!

997
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,820
Yeah, I think this floor was cursed.

998
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,980
I think this floor was cursed.

999
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,100
I think this floor is cursed.

1000
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,160
What did you see?

1001
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,120
Did you see the skeleton?

1002
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,480
The face?

1003
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1004
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,120
No, I looked at the painting.

1005
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,420
I looked at this painting.

1006
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,780
There was a face in the painting and I looked at it.

1007
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,860
And I was like, what's this?

1008
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,300
It showed up on my whole screen.

1009
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,020
I told you.

1010
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
This is a Wii team.

1011
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,920
What I do, you get affected.

1012
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,540
Why is this guy just sitting here the whole time?

1013
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,520
Why is he here?

1014
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,140
He's like triplet.

1015
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,300
He's moral support.

1016
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,140
He needs to be a team player.

1017
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,880
He's the one that popped out like five minutes later.

1018
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,100
He's the one that popped out like five minutes later.

1019
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,160
So we don't talk about him.

1020
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,640
He was in there a little too long.

1021
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,840
He was in there a little too long.

1022
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,760
He's like super cooked in the oven.

1023
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,320
It's fine.

1024
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,360
He's just the silent archetype.

1025
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,180
Oh, we're like the Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

1026
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,880
I think we're more like the three stooges.

1027
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,320
I think it's good.

1028
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,860
I think so too.

1029
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,340
So we should be at the other side then.

1030
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,760
Of the elevator.

1031
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,340
We should be on this side.

1032
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,780
Because if there's no anomaly, we go to the other side.

1033
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,840
How are you still wondering about the elevator?

1034
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,200
The rules.

1035
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,500
I can't remember this.

1036
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,540
We're on the sixth floor.

1037
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,740
I'm just finding anomalies, okay?

1038
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,020
Wait, no.

1039
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,140
Oh yeah, if you find it, go back to the elevator.

1040
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,160
Oh my god, I can't do this.

1041
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,480
There are two rules.

1042
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,940
It's too complicated.

1043
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,340
It's too complicated.

1044
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,240
What do you mean there's two rules?

1045
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,260
It can't be complicated with these two rules.

1046
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,160
I thought you had...

1047
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,940
photographic memory.

1048
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,560
I didn't say I had photographic memory.

1049
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,300
I didn't say that even once.

1050
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,000
Wait, what did you say?

1051
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,360
You had photographic something.

1052
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,260
I don't remember.

1053
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,380
Well, we know you definitely don't have photographic memory.

1054
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
No, definitely not.

1055
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,040
I don't see any anomalies.

1056
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,260
I don't see anything either.

1057
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,800
Let's see.

1058
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,700
One, two, three, four...

1059
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,200
Count the doors!

1060
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,900
I counted, there's six.

1061
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,240
Okay, and the fire extinguishers are real.

1062
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,420
They look good.

1063
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,800
Oh wait!

1064
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,320
There's a six on this door.

1065
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,900
Wasn't there a six?

1066
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,020
Was there always a six?

1067
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,300
There's a six on every door.

1068
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,000
Was that always the case?

1069
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,700
I think so.

1070
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,760
I can't remember.

1071
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,960
Chat, do your part.

1072
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,660
Come on.

1073
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:36,880
You're the game.

1074
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,840
You're player three and four.

1075
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,380
Why are they all labeled six?

1076
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,100
What's the point of streaming if you don't help out?

1077
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,760
No help.

1078
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,400
What are you talking about?

1079
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,660
Chat, is this real?

1080
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,080
I think it's an anomaly.

1081
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,120
Guys, is this...

1082
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,360
Has this always been here?

1083
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,040
Chat...

1084
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,920
Guys, is there anything on the floor?

1085
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,860
No help.

1086
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,280
Why do they keep saying that?

1087
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,640
Guys, you're...

1088
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,680
Guys, our fucking live tag...

1089
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,160
is literally called Bird Cedars.

1090
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,760
As in Back Cedars.

1091
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,300
Where are my goddamn Back Cedars?

1092
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,220
Okay, Back Cedars, it's your time to rise.

1093
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,340
Yes, your time to shine.

1094
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,620
You guys love telling the streamer what to do.

1095
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,120
Guys...

1096
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,860
Tell the streamer what to do.

1097
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,100
They said it's an anomaly.

1098
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,360
Wait, which one did we come from?

1099
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,900
Which elevator?

1100
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,760
No help?

1101
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,660
Wait, you're right.

1102
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,480
Oh no, this one.

1103
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:29,920
This one.

1104
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,220
The orange.

1105
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,200
Whatever has the orange...

1106
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,260
Where does it say...

1107
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,380
What do you mean whatever has the orange?

1108
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,280
Whatever has the orange is where we came from.

1109
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,600
Whatever has the orange is where we came from.

1110
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,080
What orange are you talking about?

1111
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,840
This.

1112
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,580
The orange...

1113
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,780
Look up.

1114
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
Oh, like the orange lighting.

1115
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,360
Oh my god.

1116
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,800
Did you just say the orange?

1117
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,420
I don't know what you're talking about.

1118
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,560
Literally, because it's orange.

1119
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,340
What do you want me to say?

1120
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,160
I said orange...

1121
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,880
The orange lighting.

1122
00:40:59,880 --> 00:40:59,920
What do you mean?

1123
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

1124
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,580
Maybe you were in the womb too long.

1125
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,260
Hey, I'm not like him.

1126
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,860
And he's a good guy, okay?

1127
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,220
How would you know?

1128
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,280
He doesn't even talk to us.

1129
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,900
How do you know that?

1130
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,200
So we come here.

1131
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,300
I think it's an anomaly.

1132
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,380
I don't remember seeing the sixes before.

1133
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,200
I'm pretty sure the sixes have always been here.

1134
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,760
Right?

1135
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,600
Chat.

1136
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,680
Chat.

1137
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,820
If you don't help us, we're going back to floor zero.

1138
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,320
Do you want that?

1139
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,480
Do you want that?

1140
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,800
Do you want to see us back to floor zero?

1141
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,840
The orange.

1142
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,080
What does no help mean?

1143
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,720
They said yes.

1144
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,180
It means no help.

1145
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,420
I don't know.

1146
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,520
I'm just thinking maybe there's something in it that says no help.

1147
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,460
They're just being stupid.

1148
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,980
No, don't call them stupid now.

1149
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,000
They'll definitely won't help.

1150
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,180
They like it.

1151
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,900
They like it a little bit.

1152
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,220
Okay, we're taking the risk.

1153
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,640
Okay, all right.

1154
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,960
Oh wait, we could have gone to the previous floor.

1155
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,100
Oh shit, you're right.

1156
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,480
We could have gone to the...

1157
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,840
All right, here we go.

1158
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,960
Wait, I'm looking though.

1159
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,040
Yeah, it was an anomaly.

1160
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,880
I dare you to go in.

1161
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,300
I dare you.

1162
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,060
Wait, there was an anomaly then.

1163
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,340
Yeah, it wasn't an anomaly.

1164
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,840
It was the six on the doors.

1165
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,680
The one that I caught.

1166
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,880
Oh!

1167
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,060
Yeah, all me.

1168
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,980
No, I already dared you first.

1169
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,660
I double dare you.

1170
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,780
By the rules, I double dare you.

1171
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,420
I triple dog dare you.

1172
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,940
I triple dog dare you.

1173
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,220
Bye.

1174
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,800
All right, goodbye.

1175
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,240
Goodbye, Mint.

1176
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,340
Wait, I get affected too?

1177
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,750
Okay, this is a team game.

1178
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,930
Don't ever triple dog dare me to do anything ever again.

1179
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,190
You mean I can't move on from her death?

1180
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,070
That's not fair, Debs.

1181
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,830
Debs, that is not fair.

1182
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,330
She can hold us hostage.

1183
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,250
That is not fair.

1184
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,670
She can hold us hostage.

1185
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,190
All F4s out of the game.

1186
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,910
That's what he does.

1187
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,990
Okay, do you want to host it?

1188
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:52,850
All right.

1189
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,410
We know.

1190
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,130
Let's see if you host it, continue the game, and see if we go back to the eighth floor.

1191
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:58,570
Continue.

1192
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,990
Does it do it?

1193
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,490
Oh wait, wait, I just pressed continue.

1194
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,470
I didn't press host.

1195
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,290
Oh, I'm on floor eight!

1196
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,070
Yeah, I told you.

1197
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,990
Come here, come here, come here, wait, yeah, come here, come here, come here.

1198
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,430
I think I... Okay, let me see how I can...

1199
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:13,550
Come on, come on.

1200
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,590
I'm figuring this out!

1201
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,170
Get in here, get in here.

1202
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,110
Okay, I can watch your game.

1203
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,570
Wait, you didn't click host!

1204
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,610
You're in a single player game!

1205
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,150
You have to go back to the main menu.

1206
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,470
I just press continue.

1207
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,890
Yeah, yeah, oh wait, oh I see you, I see you.

1208
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:31,810
Hold on, hold on, let me see.

1209
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,810
Okay, okay, I'm in, I'm in.

1210
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,870
We're at level eight!

1211
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,290
Yeah!

1212
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:37,690
Yippee!

1213
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,570
Okay, no.

1214
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,570
Yeah, yeah, no.

1215
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,970
We're not doing that again, yeah, yeah.

1216
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,330
We got...

1217
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,350
We got achievement where like, I think the game crashed.

1218
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:47,950
I think so.

1219
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,010
That was the achievement.

1220
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:50,870
Yeah, yeah.

1221
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:52,610
Nice.

1222
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:53,830
Alright.

1223
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,530
Okay.

1224
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,290
Oh yeah, there was no sixes!

1225
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:56,790
Yeah!

1226
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:57,770
Alright!

1227
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:58,970
Little friend.

1228
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,310
Our brother.

1229
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:02,450
Alright.

1230
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,030
Our triplet.

1231
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:05,830
Our Louie.

1232
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,330
Our Louie.

1233
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,290
Louie was the silent one, right?

1234
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,850
I have no idea.

1235
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,170
I don't know, I don't remember.

1236
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:13,970
Aren't those the ducks?

1237
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,430
Yeah, they're the...

1238
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,390
Yes, it's the ducks.

1239
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,750
But none of them were silent, right?

1240
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:23,050
Yeah, no, one of them was like the newer DuckTales.

1241
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,070
The newer DuckTales.

1242
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,250
Oh.

1243
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,830
One of them was like, they made one of them silent.

1244
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,430
And then one of them was the Sonic's voice actor.

1245
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,330
Oh yeah, I knew that.

1246
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,530
And the other one was Abed.

1247
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,270
Abed, yeah.

1248
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,030
Yeah, yeah.

1249
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,630
I think we're good here.

1250
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:40,890
I think so too.

1251
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,030
I think there's no anomalies.

1252
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:42,690
I don't think so either.

1253
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:42,830
I don't think so either.

1254
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:43,990
Yeah.

1255
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:44,770
Move.

1256
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,050
No, you move.

1257
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,130
We're team...

1258
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,350
No, you move.

1259
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:48,710
You move.

1260
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,710
WrestleTuber 20, 20, 25.

1261
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:57,330
We have Abed in Hospital 666 WrestleTuber.

1262
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,310
The sequel to WrestleTuber, we're going to a hospital.

1263
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,250
The sequel to WrestleTuber, we're going to a hospital.

1264
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:03,930
Okay.

1265
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,070
Okay.

1266
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,570
All right.

1267
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:05,910
Here we go.

1268
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:06,270
All right.

1269
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,150
10 floor.

1270
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:08,750
10.

1271
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,090
10.

1272
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,830
10.

1273
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:10,410
10.

1274
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:10,810
Yeah.

1275
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,610
Yeah.

1276
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,190
We're so good at this game.

1277
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,310
We are really good at this game.

1278
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:16,970
Yeah.

1279
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,270
We can see all the anomalies.

1280
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,610
I thought the doors would open at some point.

1281
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,310
I think that's like, you know how there's a locked part?

1282
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:29,310
I know the doors, you can open them, but I think, you know, like when you start a game, it's like easy, normal, and locked.

1283
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,390
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1284
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,850
I think the locked portion, you can open the doors.

1285
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:33,230
Oh, yeah.

1286
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:33,570
Okay.

1287
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:33,950
Okay.

1288
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:35,850
Our vision is terrible.

1289
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,030
We have to get...

1290
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,930
We have to get all of you close.

1291
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:39,830
What are these?

1292
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,790
No, I can see it.

1293
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:41,970
I think it's right.

1294
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:42,330
Wait.

1295
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,070
May, June, July.

1296
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,510
That's right.

1297
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:45,950
We care about your health.

1298
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,930
Why is it like if I'm like halfway in between, it gets like really blurry?

1299
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,890
I think you need glasses.

1300
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,950
I can see it fine.

1301
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,170
Are you on low quality?

1302
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,170
Probably.

1303
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,870
The game defaults to low graphics.

1304
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,070
Yeah, because it's making me lag anyway sometimes.

1305
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,030
Oh, wait.

1306
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:01,370
Really?

1307
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:01,910
Yeah.

1308
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,270
I opened it up this time and DX.

1309
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,110
Maybe it'll help.

1310
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:06,350
Ah!

1311
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:08,650
Stop it!

1312
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:09,510
Stop it!

1313
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,610
Stop going wombo-combo on your ass.

1314
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,730
She's the violent triplet.

1315
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,670
She's the one that mom had to take to the hospital.

1316
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,550
I have anger issues.

1317
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:23,390
Wait.

1318
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,350
So, do we go in this one?

1319
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:24,910
Yeah.

1320
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,410
We go to this one because there's no anomalies.

1321
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:26,950
Okay.

1322
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:28,230
All right.

1323
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:28,990
Up.

1324
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,370
Up we go.

1325
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,270
Eleven.

1326
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,350
Eleven.

1327
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:31,670
Eleven.

1328
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:32,490
Eleven.

1329
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,190
Yeah, it's my soldier jeans.

1330
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:35,930
Exactly.

1331
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,030
She has the killing gene in here.

1332
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,570
Oh!

1333
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:40,910
Oh!

1334
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:41,490
Oh!

1335
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:41,870
Oh!

1336
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,050
Oh!

1337
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:43,510
Oh!

1338
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:44,530
Oh!

1339
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:46,230
I think...

1340
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,030
I don't know about...

1341
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,130
I think you should have talked to her.

1342
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,630
I can fix her.

1343
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,850
I can fix her.

1344
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:54,930
Okay.

1345
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:55,630
All right.

1346
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,550
One clock.

1347
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,410
One clock.

1348
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:58,750
One brother.

1349
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,370
All the coffees.

1350
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:00,810
Oh!

1351
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:01,430
Oh!

1352
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,230
Oh!

1353
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:02,850
Oh!

1354
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:03,990
Oh!

1355
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,330
Oh!

1356
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:04,850
Oh!

1357
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,470
Oh!

1358
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,510
Oh!

1359
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,390
Oh!

1360
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:09,790
I think...

1361
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,670
I think something's happening on that floor.

1362
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:12,710
No.

1363
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:14,910
All right.

1364
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,250
We're fine.

1365
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:16,570
See?

1366
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,630
Everything is fine.

1367
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,290
I'm not letting you out of here.

1368
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,310
Oh!

1369
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:21,730
Look up.

1370
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,170
Oh!

1371
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:23,690
Oh!

1372
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:24,870
Yeah.

1373
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,430
We are speedrunning this game.

1374
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,010
I think...

1375
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,890
I think this is a fire hazard.

1376
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:30,710
All right.

1377
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,290
With all those fire alarms.

1378
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:32,810
See?

1379
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:33,870
They're a little paranoid.

1380
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:34,350
That's okay.

1381
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,530
All right.

1382
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:39,150
All right.

1383
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:39,370
All right.

1384
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,030
This looks normal.

1385
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:40,410
All right.

1386
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:40,510
Finally.

1387
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,170
This looks like a normal time.

1388
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:42,790
Yeah.

1389
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,030
Everything looks good.

1390
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:45,710
Okay.

1391
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:46,830
So far.

1392
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,090
All right.

1393
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:47,410
Coffee.

1394
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,990
Gold.

1395
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,630
So good.

1396
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,050
Our brother is still here.

1397
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,390
Wait.

1398
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,130
There's still...

1399
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,470
Have there always been this many fire alarms?

1400
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:54,670
I haven't been looking up.

1401
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,150
Gamers don't look up, you guys.

1402
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:56,590
Yeah.

1403
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,490
Gamers don't look...

1404
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,330
I think it's...

1405
00:48:59,170 --> 00:48:59,690
Wait.

1406
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,230
Has there?

1407
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,550
I don't know.

1408
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:01,870
I don't think that's...

1409
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,370
Now I'm paranoid.

1410
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:03,270
Yeah.

1411
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:03,710
Me too.

1412
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:07,370
After seeing like 200 fire alarms on one ceiling.

1413
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,950
Now I don't know.

1414
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:10,630
Has there always been?

1415
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,510
That's a little bit too much, isn't it?

1416
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:12,710
Right.

1417
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,430
I feel like...

1418
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:14,690
Right.

1419
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,370
But they wouldn't...

1420
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,650
I feel like a hospital shouldn't have that many.

1421
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,030
They wouldn't do two anomalies with this many.

1422
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,890
Like with a bunch of fire alarms, right?

1423
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,950
I mean, the fucking dev crashed our game, so I feel like that's something.

1424
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,390
Wait a minute.

1425
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,430
This door is huge.

1426
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,490
Oh, you're right.

1427
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:31,710
Wait.

1428
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,570
The doors are huge.

1429
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,290
Yeah.

1430
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,530
Oh, we're tiny.

1431
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:35,390
Oh.

1432
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,050
I like how we passed like five doors in a minute.

1433
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,070
Every single...

1434
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,370
We went through five doors in a minute.

1435
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,590
We went to the very end of the hallway.

1436
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,610
We went through five doors and we're like, that seems normal.

1437
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:50,610
We're regressing in our height, in our old age.

1438
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,350
Look, we were focused on the fire alarms.

1439
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,570
We're focused on the safety.

1440
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:55,510
Oh.

1441
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:56,150
Oh.

1442
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,990
Oh, wait.

1443
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,050
The door is open.

1444
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,210
I triple dare dog dare you to go through that door.

1445
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:02,610
I did it last time.

1446
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:03,270
You...

1447
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,410
You go.

1448
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,330
You go.

1449
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,190
How about we do it together as twins?

1450
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,050
No, you baby.

1451
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:08,610
Baby.

1452
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,250
As twins.

1453
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:09,350
As twins.

1454
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:09,590
As twins.

1455
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,210
We do this together.

1456
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:11,670
As twins.

1457
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,350
Why didn't you come with me last time then?

1458
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:14,830
I did.

1459
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,210
No, you didn't.

1460
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,510
I saw you in the elevator.

1461
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,630
I was about to get out of that elevator when you went in.

1462
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,370
I was gonna...

1463
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,130
Go.

1464
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,070
Go, Doki.

1465
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:23,830
Go, Doki.

1466
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:24,510
Go.

1467
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:25,170
Go.

1468
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:25,850
Go in there.

1469
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:26,970
Oh.

1470
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:27,710
Go to the other one.

1471
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,310
Go to the other one.

1472
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,130
Go to the other one.

1473
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,190
What do you mean?

1474
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:29,650
That was...

1475
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,570
There's more than one?

1476
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:30,950
Yeah.

1477
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:31,630
Another door opened.

1478
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,690
What do you mean?

1479
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,830
Okay, I just did that door.

1480
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:34,370
It's your turn.

1481
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,150
No, no, no.

1482
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:35,610
We swap.

1483
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,150
No, no, no.

1484
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,310
We swap.

1485
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,070
Go, Doki.

1486
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,370
Whatever jump scare comes out, you get it too.

1487
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,190
Okay, good.

1488
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:51,950
There's another one.

1489
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,390
Is this some Scooby Doo shit?

1490
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:56,570
Oh.

1491
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:57,070
Oh.

1492
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:57,930
Go get the other one.

1493
00:50:59,470 --> 00:50:59,830
Go.

1494
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:00,370
Go, Doki.

1495
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:00,950
Go.

1496
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:01,610
Go, Doki.

1497
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:01,890
Go.

1498
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:02,430
Go.

1499
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:02,670
Go.

1500
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:02,730
No.

1501
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,270
No.

1502
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,490
Go.

1503
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:03,790
Go.

1504
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:04,050
Go.

1505
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:04,690
Go.

1506
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:04,950
Go.

1507
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:05,150
Go.

1508
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,350
Go.

1509
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:05,610
Go.

1510
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:05,690
Go.

1511
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,370
Go.

1512
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:07,130
Go.

1513
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:07,970
Go.

1514
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,070
Go.

1515
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:09,650
Yeah,

1516
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,110
that's right.

1517
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:14,890
Oh.

1518
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,490
There.

1519
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,410
I knew it's the same door.

1520
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,490
This door opened before.

1521
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,950
It is Scooby Doo.

1522
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:20,950
It's looping.

1523
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:21,510
It's looping.

1524
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,570
I told you, it's Scooby Doo.

1525
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,570
What's new Scooby-Doo?

1526
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:27,870
What's new Scooby-Doo?

1527
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,630
Someone's like this instigator mint.

1528
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,670
Oh, yeah, it is cow- I read that wrong.

1529
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,050
Yeah, it is coward dokey instigator mint.

1530
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:40,270
You're ready to like rip that chatter apart.

1531
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,310
I was like, what do you mean coward mint?

1532
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,690
Can we finally have a regular floor?

1533
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,590
We've had like anomalies like back to back.

1534
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,050
Um, it's not normal.

1535
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,410
It's not normal.

1536
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,750
It's not normal.

1537
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,510
He's happy.

1538
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:58,510
Solidus.

1539
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,810
He's like gamer subs.

1540
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,070
Oh my god, he's laughing.

1541
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,390
Where he is?

1542
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:10,170
Is this the dev?

1543
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,010
Is this the dev's laugh?

1544
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,910
Oh my god, is he getting louder?

1545
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,310
Maybe that's why he's single.

1546
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,430
We win what's going on.

1547
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:25,290
What's going on?

1548
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,190
Oh what the heck was that bloody butt baby?

1549
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,370
It was the scp.

1550
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,510
Yes, oh my god.

1551
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,330
What was that?

1552
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:32,810
What is that?

1553
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:32,810
What was that?

1554
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,130
What's going on?

1555
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:36,910
Abrid victory

1556
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,050
We gotta get vent to the elevator, we gotta get vent to the elevator!

1557
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:49,890
What?

1558
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,430
me me me it's marketing whyctor

1559
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,550
Oh my god.

1560
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,090
It's really coming after you.

1561
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,210
Wait, I can't get past.

1562
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,390
He's blocking the way.

1563
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,290
He's blocking the way.

1564
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,050
I took too long.

1565
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:09,530
I'm stuck.

1566
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:10,730
I can't get past.

1567
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:11,610
What if he turns around?

1568
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,510
What if he turns around?

1569
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:12,990
I'm gonna...

1570
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,270
Oh, he's not turning around.

1571
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,010
He's not turning around.

1572
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,850
Wait, I'm not getting... You need to be in the elevator.

1573
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,270
Oh, we escaped from the statue.

1574
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,390
We escaped from floor 66.

1575
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,910
Oh, we're at 100!

1576
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:28,850
We're at 100!

1577
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,430
Wait, how did we get to 100?

1578
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:33,210
I don't know.

1579
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,470
Oh, that's the door again.

1580
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,110
It's the door again.

1581
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,070
No!

1582
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:42,430
I think... I don't think... I think this is because we've advanced now.

1583
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,930
It's like a new... Oh, that's why... Oh, so there's more to this.

1584
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,690
Now we have to memorize this floor.

1585
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,370
Okay, there's aspirin.

1586
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,290
There's a med kit.

1587
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,810
Our brother moved.

1588
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,470
Our brother moved.

1589
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:59,590
He finally... You know, like, the American healthcare system where you have to, like, wait in the waiting room for, like, hours?

1590
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,590
Hours and hours?

1591
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,190
He finally got it!

1592
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:01,850
Yeah!

1593
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,010
Water.

1594
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:03,650
He's next!

1595
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,410
He just has to wait another five hours.

1596
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,410
He just needs to... Yeah, he needs to wait another five hours.

1597
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:13,030
But at least he gets a chair now.

1598
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:13,410
He gets a chair?

1599
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:14,290
Yeah.

1600
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,730
Everything out here looks the same, I think.

1601
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,550
Besides him.

1602
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,410
I think this is, like... I think it's the default.

1603
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:23,230
Like, uh... Like, oh, this is what it looks like with no anomalies.

1604
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,790
I think.

1605
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:25,750
It has to be.

1606
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,030
I think so, yeah.

1607
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:26,310
I think so.

1608
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,510
Because, like, we started off on this floor.

1609
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,750
Okay, let's look in here.

1610
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,830
Okay, there's a big old couch.

1611
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,150
There's two chairs.

1612
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:32,690
Oh, yeah.

1613
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,230
Memorize that with your non-photographic memory.

1614
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:36,370
Yeah, I'm going to.

1615
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,990
Plant.

1616
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:37,850
Wheelchair.

1617
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,170
Two chairs here.

1618
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,370
There's two chairs everywhere.

1619
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:42,130
Two chairs.

1620
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:42,970
Two hospital beds.

1621
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:44,110
There's a chair here.

1622
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,830
Vitamins.

1623
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:46,770
Vitamins.

1624
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:47,550
How many hospital beds?

1625
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:47,890
More vitamins.

1626
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,250
One, two, three, four, five hospital beds.

1627
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,710
And then it's, like, blue and then purple, purple.

1628
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:53,730
Yeah, yeah.

1629
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:53,990
Purple.

1630
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,590
Blue.

1631
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,390
Alright.

1632
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:55,710
Blue.

1633
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:55,770
Purple.

1634
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:56,070
We should be good.

1635
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,390
We're not going to remember this.

1636
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,330
We're not going to remember this.

1637
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:58,770
No, we're not going to remember this.

1638
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,490
This is why chat's here.

1639
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,630
Chat, let's just do your part.

1640
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:01,710
Do your part, everybody.

1641
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,650
Do your part.

1642
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,170
You love Helldivers, too.

1643
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,050
Now it's time to...

1644
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,730
It's just like Helldivers.

1645
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,670
Why is everybody saying, no Elf?

1646
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,370
Why don't you...

1647
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,630
Are your H keys broken?

1648
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,630
What's going on?

1649
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:18,990
101!

1650
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:20,370
Let's go!

1651
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:21,570
Yay!

1652
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,150
Okay.

1653
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,870
Is our brother in the hospital room?

1654
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:27,270
I'm going to go check on him.

1655
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,190
Wait.

1656
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,090
Go check on him.

1657
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,570
I think everything looks the same out here.

1658
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:33,250
Yeah.

1659
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,190
Let's see.

1660
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,730
The paintings are the same.

1661
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,030
Oh!

1662
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,030
Oh!

1663
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,290
What?

1664
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,150
This room is haunted!

1665
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,130
This room is haunted!

1666
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:43,350
Why?

1667
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,090
Go check!

1668
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,530
Go look, you baby!

1669
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,330
Go look!

1670
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,250
Go look!

1671
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,210
This room is haunted!

1672
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:51,770
No, no!

1673
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:52,430
Fuck you!

1674
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,330
No, it's not!

1675
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,290
Yes, it is!

1676
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:55,710
How is it haunted?

1677
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:03,850
It's your cousin!

1678
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,510
What is he doing here?

1679
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,330
You are such a baby for him!

1680
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,230
She ghost!

1681
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,050
It's a ghost!

1682
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,510
I didn't know!

1683
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,690
I didn't expect your...

1684
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:18,710
I didn't expect your cousin to come to this class!

1685
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,350
It's actually my face reveal.

1686
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,530
Thank you very much.

1687
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:27,950
You have like a fucking ghost sheet underneath.

1688
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,690
It's underneath my skin suit.

1689
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,370
So underneath my skin suit is a tomato.

1690
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,090
Underneath her skin suit is a Halloween costume.

1691
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,210
At least I don't rot.

1692
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,210
You know that!

1693
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,970
I could be like an alien tomato!

1694
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,890
You're not ripe anymore!

1695
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,670
What about the boomer code?

1696
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,670
It's like boomer!

1697
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,230
Get it?

1698
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,370
Cause I say boo a lot!

1699
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:01,690
Where's the mer for?

1700
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,710
Where's the mer for?

1701
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:04,490
Mer!

1702
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,910
Wait, did I just see something in there?

1703
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,090
What do you mean?

1704
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,790
Oh, you're showing me a baby now!

1705
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,590
Oh, no, there's definitely something in there.

1706
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:14,010
It's twitching.

1707
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,590
Oh yeah, there's definitely... Oh yeah, I see that.

1708
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,490
Go, go, go.

1709
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:16,990
Wait, what?

1710
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,450
I went in last time!

1711
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,230
No, you didn't!

1712
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,530
I don't want to talk about it.

1713
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:22,070
Yes, I did.

1714
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,330
Chat would agree with me.

1715
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,990
What is that?

1716
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,010
What is that?

1717
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:26,590
We're going together!

1718
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:27,870
As twins, we go in together.

1719
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:28,630
Okay, you go first.

1720
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:29,830
We can't go... Okay.

1721
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,290
You go first, I'll go in after.

1722
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,010
Go ahead.

1723
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:32,810
Okay.

1724
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,550
Oh, it's a body bag.

1725
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,850
Oh, it's like crunchy.

1726
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:39,710
It is?

1727
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:40,330
Yeah.

1728
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,310
Oh, why is it crunchy?

1729
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,050
Why is it crunchy?

1730
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:43,570
Yeah.

1731
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,690
Is he eating cereal in there?

1732
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,830
Are we playing the Mortary Assistant again?

1733
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,010
Oh God, please don't!

1734
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,810
I'd rather die again than play that game.

1735
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,610
Wait, so how many floors did we get to before we got to the 66?

1736
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,350
I don't remember, honestly.

1737
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,530
I don't remember.

1738
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:08,530
We were...

1739
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,250
We definitely didn't do 100 floors, I think.

1740
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:12,330
Yeah.

1741
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:13,030
Oh!

1742
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:14,430
Wait, what?

1743
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,110
Did you hear that?

1744
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,790
Oh!

1745
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:16,050
Whoa!

1746
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,770
Wait, another door opened.

1747
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:18,850
Oh, okay.

1748
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:19,710
Okay, it's time to go.

1749
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,350
It's time to go.

1750
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:20,990
Yeah, it's time to go.

1751
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:21,550
It's time to go.

1752
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:22,230
It's time to go.

1753
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:22,250
It's time to go.

1754
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:22,570
It's time to go.

1755
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:23,010
Get out of here.

1756
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,450
Get out of here.

1757
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:23,670
Yeah.

1758
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:28,570
If there's no one on the wheelchair, it's either a miracle or something happened.

1759
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:28,990
So what?

1760
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:29,810
You mean a miracle?

1761
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,490
Wouldn't it be more of a miracle if they get out of the wheelchair?

1762
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,070
Not if the wheelchair goes away.

1763
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,050
Yeah, but that means somebody just suddenly learned how to walk.

1764
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,690
And then they push the wheelchair away.

1765
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,310
And be like, I can walk now.

1766
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:42,910
Yay!

1767
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,490
I don't need it.

1768
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:45,590
I don't need this.

1769
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:46,230
I don't need it anymore.

1770
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,430
He throws it across the room.

1771
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,770
Okay, I think we're safe in this room now.

1772
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:53,030
Wait.

1773
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,830
Was he always staring at us?

1774
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:55,150
Or...

1775
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,850
Yeah, he was always staring at us.

1776
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:57,390
That's our brother.

1777
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,250
No, no, no, no.

1778
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,030
No, no.

1779
00:58:59,210 --> 00:58:59,850
Oh, wait, wait.

1780
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:00,370
Oh, wait.

1781
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,130
Oh, no, no, no.

1782
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,190
No, no, no.

1783
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:02,470
Okay, yeah.

1784
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:03,050
No, no, no.

1785
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,390
Okay, what is so...

1786
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,770
He's getting sentience, Dokie.

1787
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:07,930
He's getting sentience.

1788
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:08,030
Why should we have a normal...

1789
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,610
He's being... He's just being wacky.

1790
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:13,410
He's quirky.

1791
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:16,970
Oh, Dewey.

1792
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:19,070
Dewey?

1793
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:22,530
I thought it was Huey.

1794
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,950
I remember.

1795
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,890
They all like... The names all blur together.

1796
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,150
They truly do.

1797
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,610
Stop punching me.

1798
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,050
I'm sorry.

1799
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,310
I'm sorry.

1800
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,790
What?

1801
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:32,050
You're being too slow.

1802
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,490
I'll give you a head start.

1803
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,290
I can't punch you anymore, I think.

1804
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,510
You've reached your punch limit.

1805
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,470
My punch quota.

1806
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,210
Yeah.

1807
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,770
The punch quota of the day.

1808
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:43,670
Another one?

1809
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:44,390
The anomaly.

1810
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,650
What's up with all these anomalies?

1811
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,090
We're speed running.

1812
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:48,850
We're speed running.

1813
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:49,310
We're speed running.

1814
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:49,730
Oh, my God.

1815
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:50,390
Oh, my God.

1816
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:51,790
Put us on speedrun.com.

1817
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:52,190
Yeah.

1818
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,070
Yeah, yeah.

1819
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,230
We're at one hour.

1820
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1821
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:58,290
We're at one hour.

1822
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,050
We're so fast.

1823
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,010
Oh, you got your punch quota back.

1824
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:04,970
I got my punch back.

1825
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,330
Every floor, you're getting your quota back.

1826
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:07,490
I'm so sorry.

1827
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,090
Is this a normal room?

1828
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,750
Did we get a normal room this time?

1829
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:14,810
Let's see.

1830
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:19,150
Don't look at any weird faces in the pictures.

1831
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,010
There's no weird faces in the pictures?

1832
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,930
If I look at a weird face, you look at a weird face.

1833
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:27,650
No!

1834
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,230
I think this is a normal room.

1835
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,310
I think so too?

1836
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,470
I think we got a normal room for once.

1837
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,110
The shadows are so weird.

1838
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,650
Oh yeah, that's true.

1839
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,370
My shadow is going over there.

1840
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,450
Has this always been like 00100?

1841
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,110
Okay, you can barely remember.

1842
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,610
I looked at it earlier!

1843
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,490
Alright, aspirin.

1844
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,310
I think this is normal.

1845
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,150
Oh my god.

1846
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,050
It would be fucked up if it goes back to zero.

1847
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:59,490
Oh my god.

1848
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,850
No, there has to be like a checkpoint.

1849
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,750
Yeah.

1850
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:06,330
Yeah, 100 must be like our checkpoint.

1851
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:08,230
I think we did.

1852
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,390
Right?

1853
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:10,930
I'm scared.

1854
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,230
We must have done it.

1855
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:14,410
Okay!

1856
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,890
Okay, nice, 107.

1857
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,410
Oh my god.

1858
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:21,150
We finally got to see the other side.

1859
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,710
I know, right?

1860
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:26,630
After so long, we've been like...

1861
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:28,790
We've been stuck in there for the longest time.

1862
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:29,550
Oh, anomaly!

1863
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:31,870
What?

1864
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,070
What?

1865
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:36,250
What did you see?

1866
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:37,330
What did you see?

1867
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,350
What was it?

1868
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,010
He chased after me, Doki!

1869
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:43,450
What?

1870
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:46,110
He got up, he moved, he didn't need the wheelchair anymore.

1871
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,650
There was no one there.

1872
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:49,570
He ran!

1873
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:50,430
He was running!

1874
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:51,570
He was running!

1875
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,590
I think he didn't take your meds.

1876
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,150
He ran at me!

1877
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,670
Oh, that was Doki!

1878
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,510
What do you mean?

1879
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,050
Oh, wait, I mean...

1880
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,250
What?

1881
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:07,250
What?

1882
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:09,690
What happened?

1883
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,630
He saw...

1884
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,030
What

1885
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,840
did you see?

1886
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,580
What happened?

1887
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,400
Okay, but there was an anomaly.

1888
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,880
It was the wheelchair.

1889
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,100
The wheelchair was shaking.

1890
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,120
But then...

1891
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,020
And then I thought he got up and ran at me.

1892
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,160
But it was he.

1893
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,240
What?

1894
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,180
I think we were in the hospital for a human.

1895
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:39,540
I think we were in the hospital for a human.

1896
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,940
He saw me!

1897
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,540
And was like...

1898
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,800
He's chasing me!

1899
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,720
Oh, wait.

1900
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,820
There's bodies in here!

1901
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,320
There's bodies in here!

1902
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,100
You bitch!

1903
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,160
You bitch!

1904
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:00,480
Don't you want to see the bodies move?

1905
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,300
I already saw...

1906
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,540
Let me rest.

1907
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,260
Let me rest.

1908
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,120
Let me rest.

1909
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,440
109!

1910
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,580
Give it up for 109!

1911
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:20,060
Someone in the chat was like, I know Doki can be something, but calling her an anomaly.

1912
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,460
SCP tomato.

1913
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,040
Oh my god.

1914
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,820
Oh my god.

1915
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,240
Everything seems fine this time.

1916
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,380
Everything seems fine this time.

1917
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:36,960
Yeah.

1918
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,680
Were you not going to check the room?

1919
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,440
You went in there, didn't you?

1920
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,680
You don't want to do the room anymore?

1921
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,560
I don't want to do the room anymore.

1922
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,200
You used to love the room!

1923
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,820
I never loved the room!

1924
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,460
You used to love going to the room!

1925
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:54,800
I hate him!

1926
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:55,800
Wait!

1927
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:56,940
What?

1928
01:03:59,040 --> 01:03:59,380
Oh, okay.

1929
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,680
The wheelchair is here.

1930
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,360
It was here and it was like shaking.

1931
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,840
Oh, so that was the anomaly.

1932
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,380
It was the wheelchair.

1933
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,920
It was, but good thing there was an actual anomaly.

1934
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,460
Alright.

1935
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,820
I don't think there is any.

1936
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,760
I don't think so either.

1937
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,240
I think we're good.

1938
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,460
Which would suck because we're about to hit a milestone, I think.

1939
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,580
Yeah, we're about to hit number 110.

1940
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,140
110, baby!

1941
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,160
110!

1942
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:28,740
Let's go!

1943
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,220
Let's go!

1944
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,060
Yeah!

1945
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,260
Is the light always like this?

1946
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,480
Oh no, that's the orange light.

1947
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,500
It's the orange.

1948
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,220
Guys!

1949
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,880
Doki, come on!

1950
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,200
It's the orange light.

1951
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,580
You can't even keep your own story straight.

1952
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,940
You thought the person running after you was me!

1953
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:48,840
I don't know.

1954
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,500
I didn't know what to expect.

1955
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,080
May, June, July, we care about your health.

1956
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,560
Wait, everything looks normal.

1957
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,360
I think so too.

1958
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,420
I don't see anomalies.

1959
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,560
Anomalies.

1960
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:00,820
Anomalies.

1961
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:02,960
Coffee.

1962
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:06,580
Water.

1963
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,480
The vending machine looks the same.

1964
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,220
Yeah.

1965
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,900
Paintings look the same.

1966
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:12,560
Oh!

1967
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,100
Look, look, look!

1968
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,500
Come in here and look up.

1969
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,000
Oh, run, run, run!

1970
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:21,800
Oh, okay.

1971
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,080
We're running.

1972
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,660
We're running.

1973
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,380
We're running, we're running, we're running.

1974
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,820
We understood the rules.

1975
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,580
We're running, we're running.

1976
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,260
Alright.

1977
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,120
Up we go!

1978
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,860
I like how we have a retry.

1979
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,780
We're like, we don't know, but like...

1980
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,600
I know, right?

1981
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,520
But let's just re-roll.

1982
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,680
It's like, gotcha, we re-roll.

1983
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,780
The anomaly.

1984
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:46,760
Okay.

1985
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,740
Fire extinguisher seems normal.

1986
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,980
Exit seems normal.

1987
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:52,760
Yeah.

1988
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:53,540
Paintings.

1989
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:54,460
Paintings seem normal.

1990
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:55,780
Paintings.

1991
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,300
The meds are all there.

1992
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,880
Because someone's still not taking their meds.

1993
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:01,740
It's not me!

1994
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,280
I don't know!

1995
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,860
Wait, is something...

1996
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,760
Is something different in here, or am I crazy?

1997
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,320
Let me check.

1998
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:11,940
I mean, we all know you're crazy, but like...

1999
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,980
But am I like crazy?

2000
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,020
But you're like Manhera Manhera.

2001
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,880
I'm like, are you the good Manhera?

2002
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,560
Or the bad Manhera?

2003
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,220
The ones that are like...

2004
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:27,840
The ones that are like...

2005
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,800
She might be crazy, but I think I can fix her.

2006
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,400
And then the bad one was like...

2007
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,180
There's no fixing her.

2008
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,600
I'm just here for the wild ride.

2009
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,000
I think we're good here.

2010
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:38,800
I think this is normal.

2011
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,100
I think so too.

2012
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,200
The coffee all look the same.

2013
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,640
There's one clock.

2014
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,740
There's one clock.

2015
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,640
There's all the coffee stuff.

2016
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,320
The calendars look the same.

2017
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,320
Yeah, I think we're fine.

2018
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,480
Doki makes me Manhera, you guys.

2019
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,680
What do you mean?

2020
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,320
I literally taught you how to use your own steam.

2021
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,880
If anybody's going Manhera.

2022
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,580
Okay, yay!

2023
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,300
1-1-2!

2024
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,080
1-1-2, baby!

2025
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,440
I think we are going to 666.

2026
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:19,380
No way.

2027
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,720
There's no way.

2028
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,060
Why are we at 100?

2029
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,080
We are already at 100.

2030
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:25,920
Yeah.

2031
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,700
Maybe it'll go from 112 to like 500 or something.

2032
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,220
Yeah.

2033
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,620
The devs did not program enough.

2034
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,060
There's no way.

2035
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:41,780
There's no way there's enough anomalies to make 666 floors.

2036
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,300
There's no way.

2037
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,580
There's no way.

2038
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,380
And it'll be like next patch update we added more floors.

2039
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,780
It's just like the spooky...

2040
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,160
The DLC floors.

2041
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,080
Let's see.

2042
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,120
I don't think I see anything.

2043
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,180
I don't either.

2044
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,800
The ceiling looks normal.

2045
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,540
The meds are still there.

2046
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,260
No one's taking them.

2047
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,040
Wait, wait, the water cooler.

2048
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,940
Oh, look at that.

2049
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,240
My chat's helping now.

2050
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,200
What water cooler?

2051
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,080
The water cooler.

2052
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,320
What about it?

2053
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:13,980
Is it this water cooler?

2054
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,940
Which water cooler?

2055
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:16,960
Oh, the room?

2056
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,980
Oh, no.

2057
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,900
I even walked up to the other ones.

2058
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,320
Oh my god.

2059
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,340
666.

2060
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,660
666 just like the doors.

2061
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:28,700
Thanks.

2062
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,020
My chat is doing their part.

2063
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:31,560
Thanks, chat.

2064
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,720
Thanks, dragoons.

2065
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,300
My chat said it too.

2066
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,680
They said in the room.

2067
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,060
Yeah, but my chat said the water cooler.

2068
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,960
My chat probably said the water cooler.

2069
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,540
I probably said it too.

2070
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,940
And I'm just not looking.

2071
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,420
Oh, so you're not reading your chat?

2072
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,920
Yeah, I'm neglecting them a little bit right now.

2073
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,520
Sorry, chat.

2074
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,460
It's okay.

2075
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,900
They're not so needy.

2076
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,720
Not like dragoons.

2077
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,840
Wisps are, you know, they're chill.

2078
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,880
The wisps are just as needy as the dragoons.

2079
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,460
Stop saying she hates us.

2080
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,940
Stop, stop, stop.

2081
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,040
Oh my god.

2082
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:14,300
She's supposed to be chill.

2083
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,100
She's supposed to be chill.

2084
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,720
Okay, no.

2085
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,820
Okay, we care about your health.

2086
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,960
The medical center.

2087
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,840
I think this is a...

2088
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,640
Fire, exit, exit, water, fire.

2089
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,220
This seems to be an okay room.

2090
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,440
Guys.

2091
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,020
I think so.

2092
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:33,940
Besides you.

2093
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,760
Wow, what's that supposed to mean?

2094
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,140
We're here for you.

2095
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,460
You haven't taken your meds since floor one.

2096
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,960
We're here for the both of you.

2097
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,540
Maybe all the triplets are fucked up.

2098
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:48,680
Maybe all the triplets are fucked up.

2099
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,920
Alright, 1-1-4!

2100
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,320
1-1-4!

2101
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:56,180
Yay!

2102
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:56,900
Yay!

2103
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,660
We haven't failed even once.

2104
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,420
This is crazy.

2105
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Yeah, just like for VOD watchers, skip the first 30 minutes.

2106
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,460
Skip the first 30 minutes, but we haven't failed once.

2107
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,580
Hey, June, July.

2108
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,220
Yeah, we haven't failed.

2109
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,400
I think the calendar will have anomalies soon.

2110
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,440
Because I feel like the words are gonna change on the calendar.

2111
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:18,980
Oh!

2112
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,660
There's an anomaly.

2113
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,220
There's an anomaly?

2114
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:21,780
Yeah.

2115
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,860
Go check.

2116
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,340
See if you can find it.

2117
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:24,780
Come on.

2118
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,560
I found it, you find it.

2119
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:28,840
Exit.

2120
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:29,280
Oh!

2121
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:30,720
There's the devs!

2122
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:31,920
Is that the dev?

2123
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,360
Yeah, I think it is.

2124
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,460
It's the dev on this PC.

2125
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,300
Oh, you're right!

2126
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,180
Oh my god!

2127
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,720
Oh my god, he's watching us play!

2128
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:38,720
He's actually moving!

2129
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,560
He's actually moving!

2130
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:40,660
Oh my god!

2131
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,560
Ew, he's smiling!

2132
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,960
He's on our PC!

2133
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,920
He's watching us.

2134
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,060
Oh my god, is this like what it feels to like when we see our chat watch us at the panels?

2135
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,860
This is what I see when I end the stream.

2136
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,680
Now it's just sad!

2137
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,580
1, 1, 5!

2138
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,560
We're here!

2139
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,060
Okay, nice!

2140
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,200
When are we getting another SCP?

2141
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,780
Yeah, where's your other SCPs?

2142
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:17,880
Okay.

2143
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,400
Checking the calendar.

2144
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,140
Seems normal.

2145
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,720
May, June, July.

2146
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,980
We care about your health.

2147
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,240
We care about your health.

2148
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,240
Min, we care about you.

2149
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,880
You gotta please take your meds.

2150
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,300
Ah!

2151
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,080
Ah!

2152
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:32,440
Ah!

2153
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,480
Tor!

2154
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,960
Look, he cares about your health, Min!

2155
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,240
He cares about your health!

2156
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,860
The shadow man!

2157
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:55,940
He's here!

2158
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:57,660
Okay.

2159
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,180
Okay.

2160
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,220
This is a really tall hospital, not gonna lie.

2161
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:02,600
I know!

2162
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,700
How many sick people are there?

2163
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,360
I think they have other things to worry about.

2164
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,220
If they need to make a hospital this big.

2165
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,840
May, June, July.

2166
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,060
It's like the only hospital in the country.

2167
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,340
They've abolished all the hospitals and just kept this one.

2168
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,300
They've abolished all the hospitals and just kept this one.

2169
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:20,580
They've abolished all the hospitals and just kept this one.

2170
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,040
I think...

2171
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,120
I think we're fine.

2172
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,920
We haven't even been in here.

2173
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,420
I think we're fine.

2174
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,920
I think we're fine.

2175
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:31,400
Has there always been this many plugs, outlets in the hospital?

2176
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,400
I don't know.

2177
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,380
I wasn't looking.

2178
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,100
I don't know.

2179
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,700
You've been to a hospital before.

2180
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:36,740
I have!

2181
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,460
Oh my god, I thought that was you and Hera.

2182
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:40,640
Wait, he's too big!

2183
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,060
I was gonna say, he looks different!

2184
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:42,800
He looks huge!

2185
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:44,380
Oh my god!

2186
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,680
He drank a lot of milk!

2187
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,060
Brother, we're all supposed to be the same size!

2188
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:50,580
Brother!

2189
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:51,480
No, wait!

2190
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,800
I think we're just small!

2191
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:53,300
We're small!

2192
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,900
Wait, are we getting smaller?

2193
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,400
I think we're getting...

2194
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,000
Wait, we got it!

2195
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,440
We're not gonna be able to reach them!

2196
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,580
We're not gonna be able to reach them!

2197
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,500
We gotta hurry back or we're gonna go back to the pool!

2198
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,140
They also shrunk.

2199
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,260
Oh my god, we like grew back up!

2200
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,640
Oh no!

2201
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,460
It's SCP's dad!

2202
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,540
No, please, god, no!

2203
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,160
Where are you?

2204
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,880
I saw a maze for a second.

2205
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:22,660
Yeah, me too!

2206
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,360
Oh no!

2207
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:24,680
Wait, where are you?

2208
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,400
There's things coming out!

2209
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,200
Come back!

2210
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,920
Wait, what's the maze rule?

2211
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,740
That's not it!

2212
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,460
I'm losing!

2213
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,020
I'm losing!

2214
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:39,680
Listen!

2215
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:41,840
Listen!

2216
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,640
Wait, you're dead?

2217
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,240
You're dead?

2218
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:45,940
I'm dead!

2219
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:46,960
He touched me!

2220
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:47,540
Oh my god!

2221
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,740
You just have to avoid him!

2222
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,160
Oh god, there's a ton of them!

2223
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,560
There's a ton of them!

2224
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:55,760
There's a ton of them!

2225
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,520
Run around!

2226
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,760
Face through them!

2227
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,300
You're a ghost!

2228
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:01,540
Oh, they stopped.

2229
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:01,940
Hey there!

2230
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:02,460
Oh!

2231
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,140
Oh!

2232
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,660
I gamed.

2233
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:08,280
I'm a gamer.

2234
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:12,220
Okay, so I saw the dead end, and I ran back to the dead end.

2235
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,400
Why did you do that?

2236
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,560
Why did you do that?

2237
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,560
Why did you do that?

2238
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,000
You might as well just say goodbye to me.

2239
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,380
We have a new room!

2240
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,160
Wait, maybe?

2241
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,020
Oh, it's 200!

2242
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:25,040
We're at 200!

2243
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,080
Yeah, we have a new room at the end this time.

2244
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:28,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2245
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,420
Wait, no, no.

2246
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,740
It's the other door.

2247
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:31,900
Yeah, it is the other door.

2248
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:32,940
The other door is open.

2249
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,840
Wait, so this is all the normal.

2250
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:36,620
This is the normal.

2251
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,560
Yeah, this is the normal.

2252
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,600
We gotta figure out the... Oh my god!

2253
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:40,960
Oh, there's our brother!

2254
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,920
He finally got into the... He's not even on the exam table!

2255
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,780
He has a bullet in his neck!

2256
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,200
He has a tumor in his neck!

2257
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,580
Oh my god, what happened to you?

2258
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,240
Oh my god, brother!

2259
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,040
Brother!

2260
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,600
Brother, no!

2261
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,280
Brother, no!

2262
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,620
This is how we find out!

2263
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,040
No, at 400!

2264
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,000
Oh my god!

2265
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,360
Is that a bullet or a tumor?

2266
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,040
I can't tell.

2267
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,320
It kinda looks like a bullet, right?

2268
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,080
I think he got shot in the neck?

2269
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,060
That's why he can't speak!

2270
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,140
They got his throat!

2271
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,700
No, brother!

2272
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,060
You have to talk to us!

2273
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,160
Brother, we're worried about you!

2274
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,800
But the doctors...

2275
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,420
You just need to wait 10 more hours and the doctors will be here to help with the surgery!

2276
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:29,920
It's just a bullet!

2277
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,140
Don't worry about it, man!

2278
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:31,920
Don't mind the fight!

2279
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:32,900
Don't mind the fact that we're in a...

2280
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,800
Don't mind the fact that this is where all the dead bodies go, brother!

2281
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,920
And it's possible to save you!

2282
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,160
Yeah, why is the...

2283
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,740
Why is the morgue in the same place?

2284
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,520
That's the x-ray?

2285
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,280
What's happening?

2286
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,260
Oh, it's Mortary Assistant!

2287
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:49,800
We're back, baby!

2288
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:50,460
Oh no!

2289
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,680
We're back!

2290
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,960
So these... there's three open.

2291
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,780
Okay, one...

2292
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,400
No, there's four.

2293
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,660
Three wide open.

2294
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:01,500
This one.

2295
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,200
Oh, I'm sorry for the details.

2296
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,420
I wanted to...

2297
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,820
I wanted to provide the details.

2298
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:09,860
I mean...

2299
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,440
If we're like looking at...

2300
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,320
Okay, then it's not four, it's...

2301
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,080
Five, six open!

2302
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,720
It's six open if you wanted the details!

2303
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:19,940
There we go!

2304
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,200
There we go!

2305
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,140
That's what we want!

2306
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,240
We're here to spot the anomalies!

2307
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:28,280
I really like that they kind of try to spruce up this room with some plants.

2308
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,220
Oh yeah, some plants and be like...

2309
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:33,680
You know, you might be dying, but at least there's like something to look at.

2310
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,360
And the smiling...

2311
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,200
The smiley face right here.

2312
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:38,940
Everything's okay!

2313
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,140
It's all good!

2314
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:40,520
Everything's okay!

2315
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,860
You're not gonna die!

2316
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,820
We have the...

2317
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,280
What is this?

2318
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,860
Oh no, it's French.

2319
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,760
Sous aux électrices.

2320
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:51,340
Wow.

2321
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,280
You like my French?

2322
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:53,940
It's authentic.

2323
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:54,860
Sous?

2324
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,780
Oh, Sous, I'm sorry.

2325
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:58,780
Sous.

2326
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,120
You don't know that!

2327
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,620
You don't even speak French!

2328
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:03,740
Ah oui.

2329
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,340
Parlez-vous...

2330
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,740
Parlez-vous français?

2331
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,600
Ah oui.

2332
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,360
Je m'appelle Doki.

2333
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:22,260
That's how you say Doki in French, by the way.

2334
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:22,980
Doki.

2335
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,080
Je m'appelle Doki.

2336
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,720
It's like...

2337
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,940
My name is Toby Fox.

2338
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,180
I didn't say that!

2339
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:37,760
Alright.

2340
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:38,540
Let's see.

2341
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,700
Oh, this is apparently CPR.

2342
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:40,620
Because they're kissing.

2343
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're kissing.

2344
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,400
We're gonna do that to our brother?

2345
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,060
Preparation and execution.

2346
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:50,360
We're gonna kiss the bullet away.

2347
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,900
We're gonna suck it out of his throat.

2348
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,140
Like a vacuum cleaner.

2349
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,080
That's what brothers do!

2350
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,180
That's what brothers do!

2351
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,800
They suck the bullets out of their...

2352
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,380
Yeah!

2353
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,460
Get yourself a true brother!

2354
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,100
And I'll suck the bullet out of your neck.

2355
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,240
If you don't kiss your brother, for him to leave, you're not a real brother.

2356
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:14,800
That's true.

2357
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,480
Wait, was that always there?

2358
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,160
The yellow sign thing?

2359
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,460
Oh, I don't know, actually.

2360
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,380
I think so.

2361
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,140
Was that always there?

2362
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,300
I think so.

2363
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,640
You sure?

2364
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,360
Um, there's an anomaly.

2365
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,060
Oh, shit.

2366
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,860
Why are you running backwards?

2367
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,100
Oh, my bad.

2368
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:40,760
Why did you run so far away?

2369
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,760
Why did you run so far away?

2370
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,120
Why did you run so far away?

2371
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,700
Okay, at least I didn't die!

2372
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,340
Like someone.

2373
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,620
You didn't even see the body bag.

2374
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:50,360
You didn't even see the body bag.

2375
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,880
I literally said, there's an anomaly.

2376
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,460
I literally said, oh, there's an anomaly.

2377
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,060
And then I saw it first.

2378
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,560
Yeah, but you stayed there.

2379
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,620
No, I literally...

2380
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,380
You pushed me back into the room.

2381
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

2382
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,320
I can't push anybody back.

2383
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,340
That is he says, she says.

2384
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,120
He says, she says.

2385
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,660
Sally sells cheese shells at the shop.

2386
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,380
I can't even say that.

2387
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,400
You can't even say it.

2388
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,140
What is it then?

2389
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,100
What is it?

2390
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:23,360
Sally sells sea shells by the seashore.

2391
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,200
She says, she says.

2392
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:27,660
She says.

2393
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,100
Sally sells sea shells by the sea.

2394
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,160
I'm sorry.

2395
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,700
I was in ESL class.

2396
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,460
And English is my first language.

2397
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,460
And English is your first language.

2398
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,140
Yeah, I was put in ESL when I was younger.

2399
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,020
And English is your first language.

2400
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:46,760
Yeah, you needed it.

2401
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,680
You needed it, clearly.

2402
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,260
I think this floor is good.

2403
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,220
Yeah, I think so too.

2404
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,940
I don't think there's any anomalies.

2405
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,620
I don't think so.

2406
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:03,440
That took a lot longer.

2407
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,840
It was actually deciding if we were right or not.

2408
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:09,420
Should we give her that one?

2409
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,740
They don't want to give us the point.

2410
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:14,820
Come on, game.

2411
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,360
I don't think they actually figured it out.

2412
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,940
I think I heard something, but...

2413
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,320
Inside the room?

2414
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,160
I don't know.

2415
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,980
It sounded like flickering lights or something.

2416
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,340
We care about your health.

2417
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,440
May, June, July.

2418
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,820
This calendar has been the same thing over and over again.

2419
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,460
Over and over again.

2420
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:34,560
When is there something new on the calendar?

2421
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,180
Brother.

2422
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,080
Brother, why is there still a bullet in your neck?

2423
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,380
Please talk to us, brother.

2424
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,440
That's all we want from you.

2425
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,140
We just want you to talk to us.

2426
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:47,340
We want you to talk to us.

2427
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,040
We miss you, brother.

2428
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,300
We miss your singing, brother.

2429
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,520
The meds are fine.

2430
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,060
I think everything on this floor is fine.

2431
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,480
The coffee is fine.

2432
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,580
The clock still says six.

2433
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,160
Thirty...

2434
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,180
Six, six, six.

2435
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,140
There's no sixes on the doors.

2436
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,440
I was like, why is my chat doing smiley?

2437
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,040
Is this because of the damn smiley in this room?

2438
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,340
Yeah, because of the boredom.

2439
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,320
Alright, up we go.

2440
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,360
Two, oh, four!

2441
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:15,820
Four!

2442
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,080
Four, four, four.

2443
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,380
Two, oh, four!

2444
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,080
Yeah!

2445
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,040
And then, like, we see the elevator, like, drop down.

2446
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,740
I know, I would, like, literally cry.

2447
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,620
We went through the maze.

2448
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:34,820
Oh, anomaly.

2449
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,300
What's the anomaly?

2450
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:37,100
You have to go see for yourself.

2451
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:37,680
Come on, let's go inside.

2452
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,660
No, we gotta see it to get there.

2453
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,020
I saw it, I saw it.

2454
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,640
You go see it.

2455
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,940
Oh, no, he's sad!

2456
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:48,380
No!

2457
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,080
He's sad now!

2458
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,160
It's the bullet.

2459
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,200
He realized it's terminal.

2460
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:53,900
It's terminal.

2461
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,560
Oh, well.

2462
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,880
We can have another brother.

2463
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,580
Oh, my God.

2464
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,320
Chill.

2465
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:02,680
Ow!

2466
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,200
What happened?

2467
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,920
What's going on with you?

2468
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:05,720
Go!

2469
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,080
I'm letting my issues out because my brother's dying!

2470
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,240
Come on, come on, Doki, we gotta leave the elevator.

2471
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,580
We gotta go find the anomaly.

2472
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,660
We gotta leave the elevator, come on!

2473
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,520
Yeah, that's right, Kat hit me back into the elevator now.

2474
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,940
I'm in the corner.

2475
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,020
Yeah, yeah.

2476
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,500
Alright, let's see.

2477
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:23,720
Oh, he's happy again!

2478
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:24,440
Yippee!

2479
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,040
Oh, wait, what the fuck is that?

2480
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:30,640
Go in.

2481
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:31,680
I saw it.

2482
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,060
Go in.

2483
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:33,400
Go in.

2484
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,260
Where's the anomaly?

2485
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,100
I see him.

2486
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:35,920
Closer to it.

2487
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,540
Closer to it.

2488
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,100
No, you get closer, you get closer.

2489
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,340
You found it, you should get closer.

2490
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:43,000
No, no, no, no, that's not the rule because last time you didn't do that either.

2491
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,100
What are you talking about?

2492
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,440
We did it together, we're a team.

2493
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,100
Okay, we're a team.

2494
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,460
That's all we have now.

2495
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:48,720
We're a team.

2496
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,440
My brother's dying.

2497
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,040
What are you doing?

2498
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,220
Come on, get over there.

2499
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,440
I don't think I can smack you anymore.

2500
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,000
You reached your quota.

2501
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,280
Well, get closer.

2502
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:58,760
It's just a man with a brain.

2503
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,100
It's the opposite of us.

2504
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,740
Is he like, clipping through?

2505
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,040
EC class, that's where our brain is.

2506
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,300
I actually can't tell if it's like a headless guy.

2507
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,760
No, he's like, clip through.

2508
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,260
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2509
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,340
He's like, clip through.

2510
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,660
Come on, let's get closer, let's get closer.

2511
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,240
Come on.

2512
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,460
What do you want to say?

2513
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:21,660
Hi.

2514
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,680
I think he's just chilling in there.

2515
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,500
He's just smiling.

2516
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,220
Wait, I don't think...

2517
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:28,160
Is that a brain or is he wearing like a handkerchief on his head?

2518
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:28,840
Oh, yeah.

2519
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,200
It's a handkerchief.

2520
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,120
It's a handkerchief on his head.

2521
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,500
I was like, wait a minute, that looks like claws.

2522
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,500
He didn't come after us, it's fine.

2523
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,960
Yeah, he was just saying hi.

2524
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,280
He looked really like sinister though.

2525
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:45,940
Yeah, he was just like, hey.

2526
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,060
That's what he does on his free time.

2527
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:50,860
What?

2528
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,140
All right.

2529
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:51,920
Hide in.

2530
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,600
Okay, it's your turn to go to that room.

2531
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,900
I'm going to look at the other anomalies.

2532
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,600
Oh, I found the anomaly.

2533
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:56,620
Oh, okay.

2534
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,220
You go in there.

2535
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:57,540
Never mind.

2536
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,900
Come on, come on, come on.

2537
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,100
What do you mean?

2538
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:00,580
What am I?

2539
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:01,060
What am I?

2540
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:01,400
What am I?

2541
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,080
Come on, get the anomaly, come on.

2542
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,080
What the fuck is that?

2543
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,740
Wait, that's just a kid.

2544
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,060
It's just a kid.

2545
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,320
It's just a kid.

2546
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,680
It's literally just a kid.

2547
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,120
They get like kid PNG on Google.

2548
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,760
No, it's a kid.

2549
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:19,860
It's like just a kid.

2550
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,320
What's he doing in there?

2551
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,680
What are you doing?

2552
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,280
It's like a doctor's, like the children's hospital.

2553
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:30,540
To make it seem more friendly, they put a child in the lights.

2554
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:31,820
It's like a skibbity.

2555
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,400
A skibbity?

2556
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:33,920
Oh, no.

2557
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:35,060
I thought you were...

2558
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,700
This is when like boomers try to relate to the young people.

2559
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,520
They just say random things.

2560
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,000
Skibbity.

2561
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,300
Skibbity.

2562
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,520
You can't just say skibbity all the time, Doki.

2563
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,060
Oh my god.

2564
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:44,560
No!

2565
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,380
Um, I'm gonna die.

2566
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,560
I'm gonna die.

2567
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,940
I'm gonna die.

2568
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,360
I gotta die.

2569
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,680
Go in there, I dare you.

2570
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,400
What you mean, I dare you?

2571
01:24:59,460 --> 01:24:59,820
Oh fuck.

2572
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,060
A double dog dare you.

2573
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,220
A triple dog dare you.

2574
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,280
Come on, go in there, go there, go there.

2575
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:06,000
A quadruple dog dare you.

2576
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,760
Come on, go in there.

2577
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,180
Go in there, go in there.

2578
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,440
A quadruple duck!

2579
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:17,780
Oh, you got lucky.

2580
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:18,700
You got lucky.

2581
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,220
I guess I can go in there.

2582
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,280
I mean, if you insist.

2583
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,180
Isn't it working?

2584
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:32,800
Oh my god.

2585
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,900
It's like, a triple duck dare you to jump over that cliff right now.

2586
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,080
You were too baby.

2587
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,220
You couldn't even go in.

2588
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,540
You couldn't even go in.

2589
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,880
Oh yeah, as the blades are rolling down.

2590
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,120
Oh my god, you're too baby.

2591
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,500
I went in.

2592
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,780
I went in the door shut.

2593
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,980
It was like, so crazy.

2594
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,900
Well, it wasn't you went in.

2595
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,880
I punched you in.

2596
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:53,840
Yeah, that's really true.

2597
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:56,940
These rooms always have the anomalies.

2598
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,640
They're kind of crazy.

2599
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,480
Yeah, I think it's because like...

2600
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,400
I think like, the devs ran out of ideas for the main area.

2601
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,320
So they just put it all in here now.

2602
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,940
Maybe we've exhausted all of them.

2603
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:06,880
Like, we've seen all of them.

2604
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,520
They're like, please leave the hospital.

2605
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:11,480
We're done here.

2606
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,820
I don't think there was an anomaly.

2607
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,200
Did anyone see anything?

2608
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:15,700
Water.

2609
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,220
I'm triple checking.

2610
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,360
I'm gonna go look at this sign.

2611
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,860
The coffin sign.

2612
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,680
I'm gonna look at the painting again.

2613
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,080
I think it's done.

2614
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:24,900
Floor.

2615
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,480
Water.

2616
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:27,940
Water.

2617
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,440
This floor is always wet.

2618
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,620
Where's the fucking janitor?

2619
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,100
What do you mean this floor is always wet?

2620
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:34,600
There's the wet sign.

2621
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,320
It's been here since the beginning.

2622
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,420
Why is every floor wet?

2623
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,580
Wait, no, we're not.

2624
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:40,920
What do you mean?

2625
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,700
Has this page always been like peeled off?

2626
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:44,900
What page?

2627
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:45,920
This one.

2628
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,760
Has this page always been peeled off?

2629
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:50,800
I think so.

2630
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,680
I don't think they would do something that subtle.

2631
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,280
Okay, no, it's this.

2632
01:26:59,440 --> 01:26:59,960
666!

2633
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,380
Never get...

2634
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,120
You will never get 666.

2635
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,180
Never get 666?

2636
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,240
Is that what it says?

2637
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,720
Yeah, you will never get 666.

2638
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,760
Oh, you will never get 666.

2639
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:16,460
Okay.

2640
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,740
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

2641
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:19,760
Yeah.

2642
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,760
We told you this was a 24-hour stream.

2643
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,280
Oh my god, it's actually gonna go to 666.

2644
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,740
I told you!

2645
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,960
This floor is 666.

2646
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,120
Oh my god.

2647
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,140
You know, I honestly thought this was gonna be like a short game.

2648
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,520
I thought so too.

2649
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,400
I thought it was gonna be like 24.

2650
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,920
It's just like the exit 8.

2651
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,160
But we're actually going to 666.

2652
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,120
But we like jump a lot.

2653
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,200
What?

2654
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:43,720
That's true.

2655
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:44,080
You found it?

2656
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:45,760
Isn't it the plaids?

2657
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,160
We're both looking at the anomalies together.

2658
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,140
Yeah, I'm finding them.

2659
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:51,880
I'm finding them.

2660
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:52,800
I found all of them.

2661
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,980
I found every single one so far.

2662
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,040
You haven't even...

2663
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,200
Come on, this is a Wii game, Doki!

2664
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,020
You have to help!

2665
01:27:59,060 --> 01:27:59,760
You said...

2666
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,960
You were like...

2667
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,840
I told you!

2668
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,640
I told you!

2669
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,240
You!

2670
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:03,360
You!

2671
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,440
Okay, okay.

2672
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,820
You think there's no anomaly?

2673
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:08,420
I don't know.

2674
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,520
I think there's...

2675
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,340
What?

2676
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,220
I think there's no anomaly.

2677
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:11,920
Oh.

2678
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,800
Did you find an anomaly?

2679
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,660
No, I think there's no anomaly.

2680
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,860
I'm going back.

2681
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,260
I'm going back to cover your tracks.

2682
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,060
Mint!

2683
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:33,060
Is there an anomaly in this room?

2684
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:35,820
Yes!

2685
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,300
What is it?

2686
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:43,940
Can you tell me what the anomaly is?

2687
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,680
The X-ray!

2688
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:47,880
Yay!

2689
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,820
Can you say X-ray?

2690
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,420
X-ray!

2691
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,420
Yay!

2692
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,040
Can you say X-ray?

2693
01:28:59,060 --> 01:28:59,820
X-ray!

2694
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:00,900
X-ray!

2695
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:01,760
What?

2696
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,760
Say that again?

2697
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,600
Can you say the X-ray?

2698
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,000
The X-ray?

2699
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,340
The X-ray.

2700
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,020
Here we go.

2701
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,280
Oh my God.

2702
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,800
You're like Boots and I'm Dora.

2703
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,080
Okay.

2704
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,300
I think all the anomalies are just in that room.

2705
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:27,980
Okay.

2706
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:28,860
I'm going to go back to cover this room.

2707
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:29,040
Okay.

2708
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,240
We are going back.

2709
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:35,840
We are going back to the elevator.

2710
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:36,700
Oh my God.

2711
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,280
Don't lie.

2712
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,300
Don't lie.

2713
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:37,540
I didn't tell you.

2714
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,300
I didn't say anything.

2715
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,600
We just turned around.

2716
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,180
Hey, at least I run out of the elevator.

2717
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,320
You just walk out.

2718
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,800
You crawl out like a baby.

2719
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,360
Like you're waiting- That's not true.

2720
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,380
I was- No, no, no.

2721
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,060
You're waiting for me.

2722
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,740
You're waiting for me to run into anything.

2723
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:56,500
It's not weird!

2724
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:56,780
No!

2725
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:57,880
Nuh-uh!

2726
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,560
Are we going to come into this room with me?

2727
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,240
Who's the baby now?

2728
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,400
I thought that was you again.

2729
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:13,180
I thought somebody was running at you again.

2730
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,300
I don't think there's an omni this time.

2731
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:16,700
We don't know yet.

2732
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,320
There really is nothing in the outside.

2733
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:22,460
It's kind of crazy.

2734
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,040
Yeah, I think all the stuff is now just in this room.

2735
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,140
That makes it easier.

2736
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,080
It really does.

2737
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,460
Did you guys see this?

2738
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,940
And before they actually add one anomaly outside.

2739
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,280
Is there anything?

2740
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,160
I really don't see anything.

2741
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,540
I don't see anything also.

2742
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:44,980
The chat was like, look up!

2743
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:46,420
But there's nothing up top.

2744
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:47,780
Oh, are we supposed to look up?

2745
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,240
Gamers don't look up, you guys.

2746
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:49,980
Yeah, guys.

2747
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:54,180
If somebody adds stuff upstairs, then they're not a real gamer.

2748
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:55,040
It's true.

2749
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:55,700
They're a poser.

2750
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,980
Check behind the standing whiteboard.

2751
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:58,640
You know what, you're right.

2752
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:00,140
I was looking there earlier and I forgot.

2753
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:00,160
Wait, what?

2754
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,160
There's still...

2755
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,620
Okay.

2756
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:03,980
There's what?

2757
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:04,940
What do you mean look up?

2758
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:06,260
They keep saying look up.

2759
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:07,260
Stop.

2760
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,660
I am not up.

2761
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,660
They said look up!

2762
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,220
I'm looking up!

2763
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,560
There's like something up top.

2764
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,560
Are they gaslighting us?

2765
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,260
I think they're gaslighting you, yeah.

2766
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,600
There has to be.

2767
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,820
Everybody's saying look up.

2768
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,220
No, they're saying gamer subs.

2769
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:27,700
Oh.

2770
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:28,640
Yeah.

2771
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,000
Anyway.

2772
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:30,860
Check it out.

2773
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:31,900
Gamer subs.

2774
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,520
Content keepers.

2775
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,760
Use code boomer.

2776
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,120
Oh, wait.

2777
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:37,580
There's no...

2778
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,220
I think we're good.

2779
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,420
No, no.

2780
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,980
Everybody keeps saying look up.

2781
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,040
I don't know if they're fucking with us.

2782
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,780
I don't know.

2783
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,660
They're not saying that to me.

2784
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,900
I think they're fucking with you.

2785
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,160
Oh, okay.

2786
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:50,400
Yeah.

2787
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:50,800
You're right.

2788
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,020
You're right.

2789
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:52,480
I think so.

2790
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,000
So, I guess there's no anomalies.

2791
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:55,820
Right?

2792
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,200
Cut.

2793
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:58,600
All right.

2794
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:58,800
Yeah.

2795
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,440
Everyone keeps saying the smile.

2796
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,200
Yeah, because...

2797
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,480
What smile?

2798
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,720
The smile in the room.

2799
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:06,020
No.

2800
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,640
Let's go back and look at the room.

2801
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:08,220
I can't.

2802
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:08,440
What?

2803
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,260
They keep saying they're missing.

2804
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,660
They're yelling that I'm blind.

2805
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:13,100
What?

2806
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,140
They're saying we're blind.

2807
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,100
My chat is not saying that.

2808
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,680
Are you sure you're not looking at your chat?

2809
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:20,520
I am looking.

2810
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:21,860
Oh, my God.

2811
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:22,580
Oh, my God.

2812
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,120
There's nothing here.

2813
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,620
What is your chat saying about my chat?

2814
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,580
They're saying she's getting gaslight.

2815
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,160
Everyone's saying the smile.

2816
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,600
What do you mean by the smile?

2817
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,840
Where's the smile?

2818
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:37,760
Don't punch me.

2819
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,700
Don't take your aggression out on me.

2820
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,500
Let's get you to bed.

2821
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,500
What are you talking about?

2822
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:46,280
It's doki.

2823
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:49,740
Dragoons SMH.

2824
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:50,920
So true, chat.

2825
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:51,780
So true.

2826
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:52,580
I'm so tired.

2827
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,040
Dragoons, are you really going to let the wisp say that?

2828
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:57,460
Fight.

2829
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:57,900
Fight.

2830
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:58,460
Fight.

2831
01:32:58,580 --> 01:32:58,780
Fight.

2832
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:58,980
Fight.

2833
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:07,720
And you know like the meme, the Simpsons meme with the monkeys fighting and then like the people surrounding them with money?

2834
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,780
Okay, we're going to level 12.

2835
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,260
It's going to be level 12.

2836
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:13,680
212.

2837
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:14,900
Okay.

2838
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:16,460
212.

2839
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:17,820
212.

2840
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:18,520
Yeah!

2841
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,200
Oh, I was getting gaslighted.

2842
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:21,680
Okay.

2843
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:26,060
1, 2, 3.

2844
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,020
Don't take it out on me.

2845
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,520
I can't, Dragoons.

2846
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,440
You're really going to let the wisp do this to you.

2847
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,740
The wisps are good.

2848
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,020
May, June, July.

2849
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,540
We care about your health.

2850
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,000
May, June, July.

2851
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,360
We care about your health.

2852
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:39,780
Wait a second.

2853
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,500
Oh, nevermind.

2854
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:40,940
What?

2855
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:44,200
Oh, I thought something was different, but it doesn't seem...

2856
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:44,640
I think everything...

2857
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:45,920
Yeah, I think everything looks the same.

2858
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:46,860
There's outlets here.

2859
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:48,100
.

2860
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:48,280
.

2861
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,140
.

2862
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,400
.

2863
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:49,680
.

2864
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:49,720
.

2865
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:50,880
.

2866
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,440
.

2867
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:51,520
.

2868
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:51,560
.

2869
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:51,760
.

2870
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:54,760
Wait.

2871
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,100
We're the same height.

2872
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:56,440
Oh, nevermind.

2873
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,780
We're the same height as our brother.

2874
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,920
Hey, everything looks the same.

2875
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:04,640
Oh!

2876
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,800
Wasn't this on the other side?

2877
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,420
No, it was always there.

2878
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:08,620
Nevermind.

2879
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,600
Yeah, the car was always there.

2880
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:11,600
What was it?

2881
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,300
No, I meant this.

2882
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:13,680
Oh, the chair?

2883
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:15,260
No, this...

2884
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:15,780
This...

2885
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:16,680
Whatever this...

2886
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,420
No, this was always here.

2887
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:17,820
Nevermind.

2888
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,620
It was always here.

2889
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,200
I was thinking about this thing.

2890
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:21,940
Like the little...

2891
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:22,500
Gaslight?

2892
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:22,580
Yeah.

2893
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:23,040
The camera thing?

2894
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,980
You can't trust nobody.

2895
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:26,980
Not even yourself.

2896
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:27,240
Not even yourself.

2897
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,680
These games make you paranoid, man.

2898
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,300
You think about it.

2899
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,580
And they're like, where's the...

2900
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:32,320
Where's the anomaly?

2901
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,040
I know.

2902
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:33,800
Where's the fucking anomaly?

2903
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:34,940
But like...

2904
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:36,200
Everything looks the same.

2905
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:36,600
Yeah.

2906
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,300
I think so.

2907
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,380
I don't think there's any difference here.

2908
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,460
It looks...

2909
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:41,900
Looks normal.

2910
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,520
Yeah, this looks normal.

2911
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:45,460
I guess we go.

2912
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:46,260
Okay.

2913
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:46,980
All right, here we go.

2914
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:47,600
Are the tiles bigger?

2915
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:48,680
I don't think so.

2916
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:50,640
Can we look up?

2917
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:52,460
I'm looking out!

2918
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:52,560
I'm looking out!

2919
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:53,600
I'm looking up!

2920
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,140
I looked up!

2921
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:55,820
I looked up.

2922
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:56,480
We're good.

2923
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,360
All right.

2924
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:57,760
Here we go.

2925
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,320
Next floor.

2926
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:01,420
Yay!

2927
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,600
2, 13!

2928
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,340
Wait.

2929
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,040
People are saying there was an extra light switch.

2930
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:05,840
Uh-oh.

2931
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:06,980
Uh-oh.

2932
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:07,620
Don't say that.

2933
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:08,780
Don't say that.

2934
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:09,940
2, 13!

2935
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:10,820
Wisps!

2936
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:11,580
What the hell?

2937
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,000
What the hell?

2938
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:14,520
The wisps are gaslighting you too!

2939
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:14,980
There was...

2940
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:15,280
Oh.

2941
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:16,840
I found the anomaly.

2942
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,460
I found it too.

2943
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:18,860
Yeah.

2944
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:19,140
Let's go.

2945
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:19,640
Okay.

2946
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,160
I don't...

2947
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,160
I don't want to go in that pool.

2948
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,320
I think...

2949
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,340
I think our brother is getting his operation right now.

2950
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:25,920
Finally!

2951
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,900
That means it's been five hours.

2952
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:28,940
Yeah.

2953
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:33,900
He went through two different rooms.

2954
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,120
I don't even know what light switch they mean.

2955
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,240
I think they just made it up.

2956
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,940
Oh, these two maybe.

2957
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:39,540
Oh.

2958
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,800
So there's always been two.

2959
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:41,500
Always been two.

2960
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:41,740
Brother!

2961
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:42,640
Did they take off...

2962
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:43,540
Take away the bullet?

2963
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:44,940
He says...

2964
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:45,380
I think they did.

2965
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,440
I think he looks a little happier now.

2966
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,540
I'm pretty sure.

2967
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:49,580
Yeah.

2968
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:49,620
I think he looks a little happier now.

2969
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,020
Yeah.

2970
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,060
I see.

2971
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:51,420
Can you see that smile?

2972
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,080
Oh!

2973
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:52,840
There's a QR code.

2974
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:53,180
Oh!

2975
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:53,500
There's a QR code.

2976
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,120
Guys, scan that QR.

2977
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:54,980
What is the QR?

2978
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,900
Is it to like this YouTube channel?

2979
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:57,640
I know it.

2980
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,380
It's getting darker.

2981
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,140
Is it?

2982
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:01,800
Oh, it is.

2983
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:02,200
Yeah.

2984
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,280
Guys, scan that QR code.

2985
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,120
Scan the QR code.

2986
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:05,400
Where's it going to?

2987
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:05,980
Where's it go?

2988
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:06,440
Where's it go?

2989
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:06,840
Oh my God.

2990
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:07,720
It's fully dark now.

2991
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:08,700
Where does it go, guys?

2992
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:09,540
Scan it.

2993
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:10,000
Scan it.

2994
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:10,500
Scan it.

2995
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,100
I bet you it goes to...

2996
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,680
It goes to like YouTube.

2997
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,360
My affiliate link.

2998
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:15,260
Yeah.

2999
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,340
Someone's gamer subs.

3000
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:22,880
Someone just said, I got a virus.

3001
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:25,960
Hold on.

3002
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:26,720
I'm...

3003
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,000
My chat was like, hold still.

3004
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,420
We can't scan it because you're moving.

3005
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:30,220
It's a YouTube link.

3006
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,380
It's a YouTube link?

3007
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:31,820
Is it?

3008
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,620
Where does...

3009
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,960
Oh, it's a Rickroll.

3010
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:35,560
No way.

3011
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:37,440
It's a Rickroll.

3012
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:37,900
Wait.

3013
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,340
It has...

3014
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,000
No way.

3015
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,320
Hold on.

3016
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,500
Are you going to scan it?

3017
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:43,240
Is it actually a Rickroll?

3018
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:44,060
No.

3019
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,520
You can play it on your stream now.

3020
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,040
It's like a five second...

3021
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,460
It's like a five second clip.

3022
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:48,080
It's unlisted.

3023
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,400
Oh.

3024
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:49,600
Oh.

3025
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,220
What is it?

3026
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:50,820
I don't know.

3027
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,600
It's a black screen.

3028
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:52,380
I can't...

3029
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,280
I can't figure out.

3030
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:54,220
Put that volume up.

3031
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:54,840
I'm trying.

3032
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,420
Hold on.

3033
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,200
Hold on.

3034
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:56,900
I'm going to watch it again.

3035
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:57,340
Oh my God.

3036
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:57,820
It's disappearing.

3037
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,220
What did he just say?

3038
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:02,460
What the fuck?

3039
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:03,840
Can you hear me?

3040
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:04,120
Wait.

3041
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,380
Hold on.

3042
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:04,700
Yeah.

3043
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:05,900
I heard it.

3044
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:06,840
I heard it on your end.

3045
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:07,800
Okay.

3046
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:08,520
I'm...

3047
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,020
What?

3048
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:09,620
I can't...

3049
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:10,440
I can't hear him.

3050
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:10,620
I can't hear him.

3051
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:10,640
Wait.

3052
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:11,140
Wait.

3053
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:11,840
Play it again.

3054
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,140
I'm turning off my noise gate.

3055
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:13,500
So...

3056
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,280
Okay.

3057
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,380
Can you hear me?

3058
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,060
I'm trapped in the game.

3059
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,440
I'm trapped in the game.

3060
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,100
Oh!

3061
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,460
I'm trapped in the game.

3062
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:22,700
Oh my God.

3063
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,120
Oh my God.

3064
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,080
There's another VTuber in here?

3065
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,580
I think we need to leave then.

3066
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,300
We need to get out.

3067
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:33,220
How dare they come to our stream.

3068
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,060
This is an exclusive collab.

3069
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:35,820
Yeah.

3070
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:37,480
This is an exclusive collab.

3071
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,160
What are you trying to do coming to our stream?

3072
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:41,040
I can't...

3073
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,820
I can't...

3074
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:42,140
Is this a rigroll?

3075
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,240
People on chat are saying it's a rigroll.

3076
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,300
I know.

3077
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:48,260
They didn't even bother to scan it.

3078
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:52,660
Look see, I went into that room first because I'm brave.

3079
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,040
Fuck you.

3080
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:57,760
All right.

3081
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,640
This is the same...

3082
01:37:59,640 --> 01:37:59,680
Oh!

3083
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,020
Our brother...

3084
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:02,220
Our brother has been possessed.

3085
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,020
Our brother...

3086
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:03,220
Wait.

3087
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:03,520
What do you mean?

3088
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:04,220
Our brother...

3089
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:05,320
Stop punching me.

3090
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:06,640
Oh!

3091
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:08,920
Oh my God.

3092
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:10,560
He's only looking at me.

3093
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:11,800
And I think he's obsessed with my voice.

3094
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:12,500
Whoa!

3095
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,220
Brother, no!

3096
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:14,920
It's not Alabama!

3097
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:16,200
Brother, no!

3098
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,460
It's not Alabama, brother!

3099
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,640
That bullet's the thing, Sam!

3100
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,120
Don't say that!

3101
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,480
Uh-oh, wait.

3102
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:27,180
Isn't it normally at 16 that we get to the...

3103
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:27,980
When do we get to the...

3104
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,440
I think at 16 we do, yeah.

3105
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,840
Yeah, so we have to get through this one.

3106
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,620
I think... everything looks the same.

3107
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:41,320
You say that literally two seconds into walking into the room!

3108
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,320
You say everything looks the same.

3109
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,860
That's how much I need.

3110
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,300
That's all the intel I need.

3111
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:47,540
It's one room.

3112
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:49,160
You would have never noticed, brother.

3113
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:49,560
It's one room.

3114
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,820
You never would have noticed.

3115
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:51,500
Yes, I would have!

3116
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,720
No, you never would have noticed.

3117
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,580
If I looked away, I would have seen him.

3118
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:55,860
You never pay attention to brother anymore.

3119
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,180
You never pay attention to him.

3120
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:57,920
Oh, yeah?

3121
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:01,260
You were the one that was supposed to look after him when he got shot.

3122
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,560
I can't.

3123
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:03,300
You know what?

3124
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,140
I think you were the one who shot him.

3125
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,340
You're the one who shot him!

3126
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,160
You play Apex!

3127
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:09,840
You knew I was going to supermarket for mom!

3128
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:11,300
You knew I was going to supermarket for mom!

3129
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,580
Supermarket for mom to do, to buy us groceries.

3130
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:14,600
Dude!

3131
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:19,020
Wait, I think there's actually no anomalies.

3132
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:22,400
Brother was in your care when this happened.

3133
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:25,020
That was trapped in the haunted hospital.

3134
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,760
We only call him brother.

3135
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:29,200
Yeah, he doesn't even have a name.

3136
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,260
He doesn't even have a name.

3137
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:31,520
Brother...

3138
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:36,800
It's because he can only say brother, so we named him a brother.

3139
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,380
He's like a Pokemon.

3140
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:40,820
You know, like go brother go!

3141
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,300
Go brother, go!

3142
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:41,400
Brother?

3143
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:42,020
Brother!

3144
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:42,460
Brother!

3145
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:44,380
Brother!

3146
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,300
I think we're good.

3147
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,380
There's no anomalies, right?

3148
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:47,700
Yeah.

3149
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,460
I don't think so.

3150
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:51,160
Yeah!

3151
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,120
It's like the Sean situation all over again.

3152
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:55,920
Sean!

3153
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:57,820
Sean!

3154
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,660
Press F to brother.

3155
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:01,140
Uh-oh.

3156
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,480
Are we about to go into the SCP world?

3157
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:04,900
SCP time.

3158
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:05,660
Oh god.

3159
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,260
2-17.

3160
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:07,980
Wait!

3161
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:08,920
Wait, what's up?

3162
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:11,500
Where are they?

3163
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:11,920
Bro!

3164
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,120
This is your fault.

3165
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:15,620
No way!

3166
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:17,340
This is your fault!

3167
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:17,800
What?

3168
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:18,620
Wait, can we go back?

3169
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,200
Hold on, hold on.

3170
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,800
16 floors again!

3171
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,660
No, no, no, no, no.

3172
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,620
What if it goes back to like 100?

3173
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,880
We can just go back up again.

3174
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,300
What does it go up?

3175
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,920
What did you do?

3176
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:34,560
I...

3177
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,800
What did you...

3178
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:37,940
What did you do?

3179
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,440
Oh.

3180
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,040
Okay.

3181
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:46,860
When an elevator just gives us question marks, I don't think that's a good sign.

3182
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,400
Okay, you go, brother.

3183
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,100
Wait!

3184
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:51,700
The elevator door is closed on the other end!

3185
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,140
What did you do?

3186
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:58,080
I'm going.

3187
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,720
Why is the elevator closed?

3188
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:01,620
I don't know.

3189
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,280
Brother?

3190
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:04,640
Brother?

3191
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,980
Brother, what did you do?

3192
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,760
Brother, what did you do, brother?

3193
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,000
Brother...

3194
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,140
Why are you not going inside, brother?

3195
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,720
I don't see anything in here.

3196
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,680
Is it like patient zero?

3197
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,120
Are we back to zero floor?

3198
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,120
Oh, someone said we're checking your mistake.

3199
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,720
Oh!

3200
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:24,320
Where did we mess up?

3201
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,140
This is the test floor.

3202
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,760
Where did we mess up?

3203
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,560
The scale?

3204
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:32,380
The scale was never here before, right?

3205
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:33,940
I thought it was.

3206
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,120
I even looked at it.

3207
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:37,140
You can review the floor.

3208
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,520
No, this is the test floor.

3209
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,620
Oh wait, or like the floor that we messed up?

3210
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:43,060
Yeah, I think this is the floor we were just at that we messed up.

3211
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:43,880
Oh.

3212
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,180
What did we mess up on?

3213
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,040
Where did we mess up?

3214
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:50,560
Oh, it was.

3215
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,340
The scale was never there.

3216
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:53,140
What?

3217
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,600
Oh no!

3218
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,900
No, I found it.

3219
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:56,420
I found it.

3220
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:56,860
Oh.

3221
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:00,880
They're sad at our mistakes.

3222
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:03,340
Yo, this is so messed up.

3223
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,420
That's so messed up.

3224
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,980
We have to do all 16.

3225
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:09,840
Okay, no, it's a fast speed run because they're all in the same room.

3226
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:10,640
It's always in that room.

3227
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:11,220
That's true.

3228
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:11,580
That's true.

3229
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:11,860
That's true.

3230
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:12,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3231
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:12,960
We can do this.

3232
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:13,080
Come on.

3233
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:13,580
We can do this.

3234
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:13,880
Come on.

3235
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:14,540
Come on.

3236
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:16,380
We can still get into speedrun.com.

3237
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,460
Oh, what just happened?

3238
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:17,820
Oh, okay.

3239
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,020
We just spammed it.

3240
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:19,620
200.

3241
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,200
Okay.

3242
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:20,860
Go.

3243
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:21,680
200.

3244
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:22,620
We got 200.

3245
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,860
We got speedrun.

3246
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:24,920
My screen went black.

3247
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:26,100
Oh no.

3248
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:26,880
Wait, can you see anything?

3249
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:27,740
Yeah, I can now.

3250
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,180
Okay.

3251
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,220
All right.

3252
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:30,280
Is there anything in there?

3253
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,260
Do you think it's going to be the same stuff as before?

3254
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:32,720
Okay.

3255
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,360
I feel like it's just randomized.

3256
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:37,540
Well, that means we know what to look for, right?

3257
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:38,780
Yeah.

3258
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:39,780
Okay.

3259
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,320
We've seen majority of it.

3260
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,100
We've seen all 16.

3261
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,040
Yeah, we should know.

3262
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:43,680
We should know what to do.

3263
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,260
Yeah, right.

3264
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:44,860
Yeah.

3265
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:45,320
Yeah.

3266
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:45,640
All right.

3267
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:46,660
So, next floor.

3268
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:47,160
Next floor.

3269
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,820
Oh, but 200 is always the test floor.

3270
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:50,440
Remember that.

3271
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,220
Oh, you're right.

3272
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:51,340
Okay.

3273
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:51,760
So, there's nobody.

3274
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:52,360
Nothing here.

3275
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:52,980
There's nothing here.

3276
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,040
We're stuck.

3277
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:57,060
We're sorry.

3278
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:57,760
We fucked up.

3279
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,200
So, we recorded.

3280
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,560
Oh, my God.

3281
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:02,020
Brother, we're sorry.

3282
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,000
We messed up.

3283
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:03,160
Brother.

3284
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:03,500
Brother.

3285
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:03,720
Brother.

3286
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,260
Oh, don't push me in.

3287
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:05,900
It's this.

3288
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:06,300
Yeah.

3289
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:07,720
What floor is it?

3290
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,680
It's the saws that come from the ceiling.

3291
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,680
Oh, you looked up?

3292
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:11,580
Yeah, I looked up.

3293
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:12,640
I wasn't a gamer.

3294
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,260
Oh.

3295
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,500
All right, brother.

3296
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:16,420
I know.

3297
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,060
We're going to get you out of here, brother.

3298
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:20,980
Why did you push me?

3299
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,500
Brother, we're going to get you out, brother.

3300
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,480
Brother is possessed.

3301
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:24,540
Brother is possessed.

3302
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:24,880
All right, brother.

3303
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,400
Possessed.

3304
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:25,780
Let's go.

3305
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:26,540
Speed run.

3306
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:27,260
Speed run.

3307
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,500
God, why is it 16?

3308
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,200
I can't believe on the last floor we fucked up.

3309
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,020
I know, right?

3310
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,760
On the last fucking floor.

3311
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,900
That means we have to check the behind the thing every time unless it's obvious.

3312
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:40,540
Yeah.

3313
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,080
Oh, the guy is in the locker.

3314
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,060
Oh, we have the handkerchief guy.

3315
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:43,620
Yeah.

3316
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:46,260
Maybe they'll give all of them to us.

3317
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,420
Maybe all 16 is just anomalies.

3318
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,600
I can't believe we know every single anomaly now.

3319
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,240
Yeah.

3320
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,860
I mean, it's easy because it's like always in that room.

3321
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,580
Where's the replayability?

3322
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:03,120
Go, go, go.

3323
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:04,380
Go, go, go.

3324
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:04,940
Go, go, go.

3325
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:05,640
Go, go, go.

3326
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:06,140
Go, go, go.

3327
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:06,920
Go, go, go.

3328
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:07,480
Go, go, go.

3329
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:07,940
Go, go, go.

3330
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:08,260
Go, go, go.

3331
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,440
Go, go, go.

3332
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:09,260
Go, go, go.

3333
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,840
Wait, wasn't one of them a girl?

3334
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,460
What do you mean?

3335
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:13,980
That like shows up?

3336
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:14,780
Oh, the body bag.

3337
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:15,900
Oh, the body bag.

3338
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:16,320
Yeah, that follows.

3339
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,540
I know where it starts at though.

3340
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:18,420
I know where it starts at.

3341
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:19,040
All right.

3342
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,480
Oh, the x-rays are upside down.

3343
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:21,400
All right.

3344
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:22,820
I'll be the elevator pusher.

3345
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:22,940
Are you?

3346
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,500
No, you're not going to be.

3347
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:25,900
Okay, we'll take turns.

3348
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:26,620
We'll take turns.

3349
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:27,160
You go next.

3350
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:27,760
You'll go next.

3351
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:28,260
What do you mean we take turns?

3352
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:28,540
Yeah.

3353
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,120
You're faster.

3354
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:29,840
No, no, no.

3355
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:30,140
I think you're...

3356
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,040
No, no.

3357
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:31,740
You go.

3358
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,160
I think you're really good at this.

3359
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,240
Okay, now you go and I'll press the button.

3360
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:38,800
What if I mess up?

3361
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,420
Just go.

3362
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,540
Go hurry up.

3363
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,520
I run in there.

3364
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:47,680
Oh, my God.

3365
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:48,480
Why are you so slow?

3366
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,620
You know what everything is.

3367
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:51,460
You literally made me do this.

3368
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:55,460
I'm going to do it my way.

3369
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,420
Check behind the whiteboard.

3370
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,220
Check behind the whiteboard.

3371
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:01,540
No, there's nothing out behind the whiteboard.

3372
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:02,160
I don't trust you.

3373
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:03,040
I don't trust...

3374
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:03,320
Oh, yeah.

3375
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,300
Oh, you don't trust me.

3376
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,340
Look at that.

3377
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,660
You don't even trust me to do your job.

3378
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:09,580
Okay.

3379
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,120
Okay.

3380
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:10,820
Okay.

3381
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:11,000
Okay.

3382
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,580
I think we're good.

3383
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:12,240
Wait.

3384
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:12,760
See?

3385
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:15,060
At least I'm meticulous.

3386
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,460
No, we got to go to the other side, right?

3387
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,040
Oh, yeah.

3388
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:17,440
We got to go.

3389
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:17,680
Yeah.

3390
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:17,960
See?

3391
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:20,560
I was testing you.

3392
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,380
I was testing to see if you remember.

3393
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,020
All right.

3394
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:27,420
Okay.

3395
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,900
That sucks because now we have to run all the way to the other side.

3396
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:30,440
I know.

3397
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:32,920
Yeah, because what if there's an anomaly?

3398
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:35,740
Two.

3399
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:36,000
Oh.

3400
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:36,400
Seven.

3401
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:38,460
Don't worry.

3402
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:38,920
I'll be here.

3403
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,000
What if it's the body bag?

3404
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:40,660
Wait.

3405
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:40,820
What if it's the body bag?

3406
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:41,420
Wait.

3407
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:42,280
Why am I going?

3408
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:44,380
Because then we know if there's an anomaly.

3409
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:45,500
Okay.

3410
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:47,820
It is a very far run.

3411
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,060
It is a pretty far run.

3412
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:51,680
I'm scared of being in here.

3413
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,240
You're peeing in here?

3414
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:55,880
Being in here?

3415
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,080
Wait.

3416
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,160
I think we're good, actually.

3417
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:00,560
Oh, no.

3418
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:01,360
That's the QR code.

3419
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:02,060
It's the QR code.

3420
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:03,140
Oh, it's the QR code?

3421
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:03,480
Yeah.

3422
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,120
The guy who's trapped?

3423
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:04,420
See?

3424
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:04,720
Look.

3425
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,660
It would be a waste of time if I ran in there, too.

3426
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:10,800
Oh, no.

3427
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:11,120
I'm scared.

3428
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,460
Get out of my way.

3429
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,800
Get out of my way.

3430
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:15,800
How did you know?

3431
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,860
I said being, you guys.

3432
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,700
It's Doki that brought up the pee.

3433
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:22,900
I can't believe it.

3434
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:23,160
All right.

3435
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:23,500
You go.

3436
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:25,260
Why do boys bring up the pee?

3437
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:25,740
You go.

3438
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:26,580
You go.

3439
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:27,200
Run.

3440
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:27,800
Run.

3441
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:28,740
Why me?

3442
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:29,620
Because we're taking turns.

3443
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,800
I did not agree to that.

3444
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:33,840
I hope it's the body bag.

3445
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:34,840
I hope it's the body bag.

3446
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:37,300
If it's the body bag, we have to do this all over again.

3447
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,260
No, we don't.

3448
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,600
You just run over here.

3449
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,720
Get in there.

3450
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:40,800
Okay.

3451
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:41,680
What if I die?

3452
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:42,700
Go inside.

3453
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,260
Oh.

3454
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,340
It's the sad face.

3455
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:47,040
He's sad.

3456
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:47,320
Okay.

3457
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:47,900
Sad face.

3458
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:48,180
Yeah.

3459
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,220
He learned he was terminal.

3460
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:53,360
So, we have to get a specialist.

3461
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,040
One of us is going to get the body bag.

3462
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,840
It's going to be really unfortunate.

3463
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:59,560
It's like Russian roulette for the body bag.

3464
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:00,080
It really is.

3465
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,060
Okay.

3466
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:04,460
I'll go.

3467
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,200
You get the body bag.

3468
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,460
I sure hope not.

3469
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,060
Yeah.

3470
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:10,360
Okay.

3471
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:10,800
Okay.

3472
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:14,980
I know where it's at though in the beginning.

3473
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,440
So, okay.

3474
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,340
It's not fair.

3475
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,320
Wait.

3476
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,000
That's not fair.

3477
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,000
You know where it's at.

3478
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,980
I'm not going to tell you either.

3479
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:22,440
Wait a second.

3480
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,420
But, make sure it's not the child too.

3481
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:26,580
Oh, wait.

3482
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:27,100
Not the child.

3483
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,360
I don't see anything actually.

3484
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:29,520
Oh, okay.

3485
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:30,500
I think we might be...

3486
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,660
Check behind the white board.

3487
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:32,240
I did.

3488
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:32,740
Okay.

3489
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:34,460
Are you sure?

3490
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,300
I don't think it's anything.

3491
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:37,760
Yeah.

3492
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:38,240
Seems good.

3493
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:38,720
All right.

3494
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:39,260
Let's go.

3495
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:39,780
Nice.

3496
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:41,400
If we fuck up, we know who to blame.

3497
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:43,940
You could have checked.

3498
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:47,680
You literally could have taken the two seconds to go in there.

3499
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:48,560
I trust you.

3500
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,440
I don't doubt you like you did to me.

3501
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:52,860
Okay.

3502
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:53,200
Two ten.

3503
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:54,160
I trust you.

3504
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:54,820
Your turn.

3505
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:55,520
All right.

3506
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,020
My turn.

3507
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,540
Go in.

3508
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:58,100
Go inside.

3509
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,020
Go inside.

3510
01:47:59,340 --> 01:47:59,920
Go inside.

3511
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,640
I'm going in.

3512
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:05,920
Nope.

3513
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:07,400
There's nothing there.

3514
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,680
Behind the white board.

3515
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:09,760
I checked it.

3516
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:10,360
I checked the white board.

3517
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,420
Check for the 666.

3518
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:12,880
You will never get out.

3519
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,300
I checked the 666.

3520
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:14,760
There's nothing here.

3521
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,000
Are you sure?

3522
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,420
Oh, you don't trust me again?

3523
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,760
There's no baby face.

3524
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:20,960
No baby face.

3525
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,080
Oh, you're coming inside the room too?

3526
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:28,620
I mean, I'm right next to it, you know?

3527
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:28,960
Wow.

3528
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:29,080
Wow.

3529
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:32,040
You don't even trust me.

3530
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,300
No, I don't.

3531
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:37,900
I gave like full commitment to all your sources.

3532
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:39,100
I was like, yep.

3533
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:39,760
You said there's nothing.

3534
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:40,360
There's nothing in there.

3535
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,020
All right.

3536
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,540
I don't even need to check.

3537
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:42,960
Okay.

3538
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,640
Because it's so long.

3539
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,300
I'm going to be on the far side of the room.

3540
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,720
I think we should go in the next one together.

3541
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:48,920
All right.

3542
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,420
You know what?

3543
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:49,780
Let's...

3544
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:50,020
Yeah.

3545
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:50,700
I agree with that.

3546
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:50,960
Yeah.

3547
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,020
We'll go in the next one together.

3548
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:52,460
Yeah.

3549
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,180
We'll do that together.

3550
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:53,720
Yeah.

3551
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:53,880
Yeah.

3552
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,360
See, guys?

3553
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,560
This is what friendship is.

3554
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:56,060
This is teamwork.

3555
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:58,620
This is teamwork is dream work.

3556
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:00,280
All right.

3557
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:00,540
Okay.

3558
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,300
Let's go.

3559
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:02,260
All right.

3560
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:02,760
Let's go.

3561
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:03,720
I'm right beside you.

3562
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:03,960
Okay.

3563
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,540
I'm just...

3564
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:12,680
Yeah.

3565
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:15,860
Let's go.

3566
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:17,680
All right.

3567
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,940
We're back in brother's privacy.

3568
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:20,140
Okay.

3569
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:20,700
You know?

3570
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,340
We have to give him his privacy.

3571
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:23,620
He's getting operated on.

3572
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:24,820
He's getting operated on, you guys.

3573
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,980
It's so rude to go in there.

3574
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:27,280
He's like naked right now.

3575
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,400
Our brothers won't look.

3576
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:29,700
Okay.

3577
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:30,260
Let's go again.

3578
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:30,660
All right.

3579
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:31,100
Together.

3580
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:32,460
Together.

3581
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:33,020
Together.

3582
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:34,080
Together.

3583
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,420
Why do you keep looking back?

3584
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:36,480
I think it's the body bag.

3585
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,700
I think it's the body bag.

3586
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,040
I think it's the body bag.

3587
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:39,360
I think it's the body bag.

3588
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:39,740
I think it's the body bag.

3589
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:40,480
I think it's the body bag.

3590
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:42,340
It's not the body bag.

3591
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:43,400
It's not the body bag.

3592
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:45,600
Okay.

3593
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:46,800
There's no child.

3594
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,200
I hope it's nothing so that we can get closer to the room.

3595
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:51,640
Yeah, me too.

3596
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:53,120
I don't think there is anything.

3597
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,420
I don't see anything either.

3598
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,300
Chat!

3599
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:55,640
Yeah.

3600
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:56,780
I looked up.

3601
01:49:58,260 --> 01:49:59,440
Thanks for the raid!

3602
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:00,540
I don't know who raided me.

3603
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:02,240
Brother?

3604
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,320
Thank you!

3605
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:06,200
Thank you, thank you!

3606
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,100
Alright, I'm going backwards.

3607
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,600
I think we're good.

3608
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:10,460
I think we're good.

3609
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:11,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3610
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:12,060
Brother?

3611
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,040
Brother?

3612
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,140
Don't worry, brother!

3613
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:16,780
We're gonna make it to the 300th floor!

3614
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,040
Thank you so much for the raid!

3615
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:20,380
Yay!

3616
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:21,780
Oh, blades!

3617
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:22,920
Thank you!

3618
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,040
213!

3619
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:25,060
213!

3620
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,300
Now we took turns again.

3621
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:29,160
Oh, it's the child face.

3622
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:30,500
It's the child, okay.

3623
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,500
God damn it.

3624
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,240
Okay.

3625
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,780
Alright, don't kill your turn.

3626
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:38,080
Take care!

3627
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:38,260
Go on in guys!

3628
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:38,860
Guys!

3629
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:39,540
No!

3630
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:39,860
It's you!

3631
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:41,180
It's all you!

3632
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,760
What happens if we get there?

3633
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:46,100
Go on in!

3634
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:49,960
Oh!

3635
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,260
There's no body bag!

3636
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,120
Dang it.

3637
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:54,980
Oh, you don't trust me!

3638
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,920
You never touched the next unquote body bag!

3639
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,720
You go right in!

3640
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,480
It's 666!

3641
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:01,920
It's the 666!

3642
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:02,440
It's the 666!

3643
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:03,320
Yeah, yeah!

3644
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:04,900
I think the next one is the body bag!

3645
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:06,520
The next one has to be the body bag!

3646
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,800
You just really have two left!

3647
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,080
It's your turn.

3648
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,400
It's okay, because if it's the body bag, I can see it from here.

3649
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:15,740
I'll let you know immediately.

3650
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,080
I'll be next to the button.

3651
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:18,860
It's the body bag.

3652
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,400
We're

3653
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:31,060
on this side, you know?

3654
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,640
Okay, this one has to be the smiley then, right?

3655
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:35,640
Because we haven't gotten...

3656
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:36,160
Oh, yep.

3657
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:37,020
There it is.

3658
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:38,740
Oh my god, that's so cheap.

3659
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,920
The last floor with the smiley.

3660
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:44,840
He must have done it so that the last floor would always be like...

3661
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,020
The smiley face.

3662
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:47,220
There's nothing.

3663
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:49,700
SCP time.

3664
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,780
No, no, no, no.

3665
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:53,700
What's happening?

3666
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,680
I can't see anything.

3667
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,380
What is that?

3668
01:51:58,580 --> 01:51:59,420
What the hell?

3669
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:02,240
It's like the Unity Store zombie.

3670
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,200
But there's like a guy blocking the door too.

3671
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:05,180
There's two of them.

3672
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:05,800
There's two zombies.

3673
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:07,140
Okay, wait.

3674
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:07,900
We gotta split up.

3675
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:11,340
Okay, the zombie is chasing me.

3676
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:14,160
I'll sacrifice myself to you.

3677
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:15,880
What do you mean, shit?

3678
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,120
I got started chasing... getting chased by a zombie.

3679
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:19,640
Oh, they're coming after me.

3680
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,300
They're coming after me.

3681
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:20,880
They're coming after me.

3682
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:25,530
Oh my god.

3683
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:26,410
They fucking ran to me.

3684
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:32,030
I can't believe it.

3685
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:33,870
I can't believe you walking dead me.

3686
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:36,090
I can't believe you walking dead me.

3687
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:36,830
What does he mean?

3688
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:39,930
You let that guy kill you.

3689
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:42,550
I literally watched him bum rush you.

3690
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:44,390
Oh, we have a new floor.

3691
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:45,250
We have a new door.

3692
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:45,890
We have a new door.

3693
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:47,650
Alright, time to see.

3694
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:47,910
Here we go.

3695
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:50,910
What's all different in this room?

3696
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:51,310
Okay.

3697
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:52,070
Brother.

3698
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:53,690
He's a doctor now.

3699
01:52:53,710 --> 01:52:54,550
He's a doctor.

3700
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:57,870
No, he's at the... he's finally... he's getting his diagnosis.

3701
01:52:58,490 --> 01:52:58,770
Wait.

3702
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:59,330
Oh gosh.

3703
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:00,450
This is gonna be so bad.

3704
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:02,710
We have to check behind these curtains.

3705
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:03,770
Oh no.

3706
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:04,390
No.

3707
01:53:04,630 --> 01:53:06,410
There has to be somebody behind these.

3708
01:53:06,450 --> 01:53:07,970
There's gonna be something on the computer.

3709
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:09,670
There's gonna be people behind.

3710
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:11,750
Oh god.

3711
01:53:12,430 --> 01:53:15,010
Okay, so like... he's waiting for the doctor to tell him...

3712
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:17,730
If the surgery was like... if the surgery was a success.

3713
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:18,590
Was a success or not.

3714
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:19,390
Oh my god.

3715
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:19,490
Yeah, yeah.

3716
01:53:19,630 --> 01:53:20,770
It's the operation time.

3717
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:22,110
Oh my god, brother.

3718
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:22,530
Post operation.

3719
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:23,810
Brother, we're here for you.

3720
01:53:23,850 --> 01:53:25,210
Yeah, we're holding your hand, brother.

3721
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:26,090
We're holding your hand.

3722
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:27,190
We're here for you, brother.

3723
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:31,010
Washing your hands.

3724
01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:32,330
Drying your hands.

3725
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,190
Isn't that like kind of unsanitary?

3726
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:35,230
The hand dryer?

3727
01:53:35,610 --> 01:53:35,630
Where?

3728
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:39,110
The hand dryer next to... yeah, I think the hand dryer doesn't do as well.

3729
01:53:39,190 --> 01:53:40,970
Those have like so many germs in them.

3730
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:41,450
It's like...

3731
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:42,030
That's true.

3732
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:42,630
And then like...

3733
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:43,370
He's pregnant?

3734
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:44,110
Our brother?

3735
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:46,650
Congratulations, brother!

3736
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:47,350
Brother!

3737
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:49,490
The bullet was actually a baby!

3738
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:49,830
Baby!

3739
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:50,490
Ty!

3740
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:50,770
Ty!

3741
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:55,030
You're gonna be a mother!

3742
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:56,970
The first ever throat birth.

3743
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:01,590
You're like this hairball.

3744
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:03,350
You cough like a child.

3745
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:09,630
I just noticed this room is like in the middle.

3746
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,070
So no matter what we do...

3747
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:11,210
Oh yeah.

3748
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:12,750
No matter what.

3749
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:15,050
We have to run over there.

3750
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:20,070
I can't believe this is actually 666.

3751
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:22,830
But it's really like... oh my god, brother scared me.

3752
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:24,250
It's really like...

3753
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:26,290
It's like 16 floors each.

3754
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:28,430
I think it's 15 technically, cause the...

3755
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:29,710
Oh, I see the anomaly.

3756
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:30,310
Wait, yeah.

3757
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:32,150
Oh, what the fuck?

3758
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:32,690
They're babies!

3759
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:35,110
It's his baby!

3760
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:36,510
It's his baby!

3761
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:37,190
Oh my god!

3762
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:38,990
It's triplets!

3763
01:54:43,690 --> 01:54:44,170
It's...

3764
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:46,110
I'm like, are you already at the elevator?

3765
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:47,690
Yeah, because we saw the babies.

3766
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:49,810
I'm not ready for this.

3767
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:52,030
It's one for each of us.

3768
01:54:52,990 --> 01:54:54,470
I'm not ready to be a mom.

3769
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:55,350
I'm not!

3770
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:56,790
We're uncles now!

3771
01:54:58,850 --> 01:54:59,890
We're uncles!

3772
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:01,030
Brother.

3773
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:02,710
I can't believe it!

3774
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:05,050
Congratulations, brother!

3775
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:09,150
It's like how triplets are predisposed to...

3776
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:09,990
Wait, what was that?

3777
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:11,110
Wait, what was that?

3778
01:55:11,190 --> 01:55:11,610
You heard that?

3779
01:55:11,610 --> 01:55:12,410
Did you hear that?

3780
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:15,490
Yeah, I heard that.

3781
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:16,290
Check behind.

3782
01:55:18,190 --> 01:55:19,550
I'll go right side.

3783
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:21,850
Okay, and also go the left side.

3784
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:23,170
What do you mean also?

3785
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:24,810
I chose my curtain.

3786
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:26,150
I chose my curtain.

3787
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:26,670
It's your turn.

3788
01:55:27,070 --> 01:55:27,890
Rock, paper, scissors.

3789
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:28,950
Paper.

3790
01:55:29,790 --> 01:55:30,070
Rock.

3791
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:35,570
Come on, go.

3792
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:39,330
Oh, I heard it again.

3793
01:55:39,630 --> 01:55:40,770
I think it is in there.

3794
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:42,210
Okay, I got an idea.

3795
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:46,430
I was gonna like jump over here and look over the curtain.

3796
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:47,250
Together.

3797
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:48,970
We're all we had.

3798
01:55:49,730 --> 01:55:50,870
This is for you, brother.

3799
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:52,270
This is for you, brother.

3800
01:55:52,930 --> 01:55:54,250
I think it's saying here.

3801
01:55:55,570 --> 01:55:56,930
Oh, it's like...

3802
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:57,790
Okay, I'm curious.

3803
01:55:58,810 --> 01:55:59,670
There's nothing here.

3804
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:01,290
Wait, what?

3805
01:56:02,050 --> 01:56:03,130
It's just going...

3806
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:05,950
Okay, so we're fine.

3807
01:56:06,650 --> 01:56:08,710
But that has to be an anomaly, right?

3808
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:09,530
Yeah, that's an anomaly.

3809
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:11,250
Someone said look up.

3810
01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:12,950
Is it up on the...

3811
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:15,230
Okay, they all always say look up.

3812
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:16,190
There's nothing up.

3813
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:16,990
Is it on the computer?

3814
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:18,990
No.

3815
01:56:19,130 --> 01:56:20,310
Oh, I heard another noise too.

3816
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:20,950
He went...

3817
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:23,150
I think it's just the same thing.

3818
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:24,790
You're just projecting.

3819
01:56:28,030 --> 01:56:31,130
Hey, Dev, if you need anybody to make noises for your...

3820
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:39,650
Thank you for the rain!

3821
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:40,650
I didn't do it for free.

3822
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:42,010
Thank you!

3823
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:44,850
Alright, where do we go?

3824
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:48,610
Thank you so much.

3825
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:52,730
I don't think I see anything.

3826
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:55,730
You looked for two seconds.

3827
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:56,950
Oh, wait.

3828
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:58,090
Was this computer always on?

3829
01:56:58,330 --> 01:56:59,350
I see something.

3830
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:05,070
That's a cool effect, actually.

3831
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:05,370
That's cool.

3832
01:57:05,490 --> 01:57:06,590
That's actually a cool effect.

3833
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:08,170
Whoa, look at all these eyes.

3834
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:09,250
Oh, they blink!

3835
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:12,010
They gave me goosebumps.

3836
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:13,150
They were blinking.

3837
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:14,870
That's just triggering my trypophobia.

3838
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:18,290
Trypophobia warning?

3839
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:24,590
Alright.

3840
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,370
3-0-4!

3841
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,810
3-0-4!

3842
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:30,890
3-0-4!

3843
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:34,470
Alright.

3844
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:37,470
Oh my god.

3845
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:38,670
Yeah, go ahead.

3846
01:57:38,730 --> 01:57:39,010
Go ahead.

3847
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:39,970
Go ahead.

3848
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:41,990
Go ahead.

3849
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:48,310
I'll go right side.

3850
01:57:49,210 --> 01:57:50,230
Nothing on the right.

3851
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:52,790
You never go on the right.

3852
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:53,230
Nothing here.

3853
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:53,850
Oh, wait.

3854
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:54,850
I have an anomaly.

3855
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:56,310
What's the anomaly?

3856
01:57:57,190 --> 01:57:59,670
It's like that maze escape game.

3857
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:02,210
Yeah, they're playing this game!

3858
01:58:02,810 --> 01:58:03,130
Wait.

3859
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:05,450
It's going to the room.

3860
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:07,190
Wait, uh-oh.

3861
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:07,830
I don't want to see that.

3862
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:09,110
Wait, are they out here?

3863
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:10,850
You think there's someone out here?

3864
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:12,790
No, they're in our room now.

3865
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:14,990
They're looking at the anomalies.

3866
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:16,270
Oh, and it stopped.

3867
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:16,950
The game stopped.

3868
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:17,630
Oh, okay.

3869
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:20,630
They're not as gamer as us.

3870
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:21,230
Yeah.

3871
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:25,150
They got too scared and stopped playing the game.

3872
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:26,250
We're never scared.

3873
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:27,670
We made it to 305.

3874
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:31,290
We're the first YouTubers to make it to 305.

3875
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:31,990
Are we actually?

3876
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:35,130
What do you think?

3877
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:42,010
Don't lie on the internet, Dokie!

3878
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:44,950
Don't lie on the internet, Dokie!

3879
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:45,610
Here, I'll go right.

3880
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:46,190
Here, I'll go right.

3881
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:46,750
Okay, I'll go left.

3882
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:48,730
Nope, no anomaly.

3883
01:58:49,230 --> 01:58:49,710
Anomaly.

3884
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:50,990
There's an anomaly on the computer.

3885
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:52,750
What is it this time?

3886
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:53,790
Oh, hey!

3887
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:57,190
There's like, insert your OC.

3888
01:58:57,850 --> 01:58:59,610
What are you talking about?

3889
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:01,550
What are you talking about?

3890
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:02,650
It could be you.

3891
01:59:02,650 --> 01:59:06,370
Those drawings where you buy art and insert your character here.

3892
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:08,950
And the black screen is the character.

3893
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:09,990
What?

3894
01:59:10,170 --> 01:59:12,070
Did we see the same thing?

3895
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:13,410
Yeah, I saw it.

3896
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:15,170
There was a black character out there.

3897
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:16,010
It's a silhouette.

3898
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:18,250
YCH, your character here.

3899
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:20,010
I didn't see that at all.

3900
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:21,030
What did you see?

3901
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:23,030
I think you need to take your meds, girl.

3902
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:25,050
No, I think you need it.

3903
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:27,090
My chat saw the same thing.

3904
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:29,950
Okay, I'll go left.

3905
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:31,290
No anomalies here.

3906
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:32,450
No anomalies here.

3907
01:59:33,570 --> 01:59:33,970
Girl?

3908
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:36,470
Yeah, what the hell is Doki cooking?

3909
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:37,570
I don't know, man.

3910
01:59:38,850 --> 01:59:39,650
She's overcooking.

3911
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:41,950
Oh, you don't trust me.

3912
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:44,510
You're looking at the left side because you didn't even trust me.

3913
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:45,630
Okay, well look at the right side.

3914
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:47,490
I think we should both double check our answers.

3915
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:49,550
Wait, was the needle always this huge?

3916
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:51,010
What needle?

3917
01:59:51,390 --> 01:59:52,830
I don't think there's ever been a needle.

3918
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:55,330
I'll be honest, I haven't been looking at the desk at all.

3919
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:57,590
Oh wait, was there always been like the disease...

3920
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:58,650
Disease history.

3921
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:01,870
Wait, maybe we should pay attention to this table.

3922
02:00:02,410 --> 02:00:03,770
Yeah, I feel like we should.

3923
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:06,210
Wait, is there always a history-m?

3924
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:08,090
History-m.

3925
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:10,270
History-m.

3926
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:11,750
History-m.

3927
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:13,210
Okay, it's always been here.

3928
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:13,570
Okay.

3929
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,770
Is brother okay?

3930
02:00:16,890 --> 02:00:18,490
This doctor is just illiterate.

3931
02:00:19,310 --> 02:00:20,410
I think we're good.

3932
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:21,650
I think we're good too.

3933
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:22,210
Yeah.

3934
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:24,150
History-m.

3935
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:26,550
See, my chat said it was always there.

3936
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:27,130
Someone said the plant.

3937
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:28,290
What do you mean the plant?

3938
02:00:28,610 --> 02:00:29,070
The plant?

3939
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:29,930
No, the plant is always there.

3940
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:30,390
That green.

3941
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:32,230
Three-oh-seven.

3942
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,010
Bing.

3943
02:00:36,650 --> 02:00:37,290
Bing.

3944
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:37,890
Nice.

3945
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:40,470
I hate it when it pauses after a while.

3946
02:00:41,650 --> 02:00:42,970
Because it's just like, what you mean?

3947
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:44,310
It's bing, right?

3948
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:45,910
Brother?

3949
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:47,990
Right side?

3950
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:48,990
Right side, safe.

3951
02:00:49,890 --> 02:00:50,770
Right side?

3952
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:51,450
Safe.

3953
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:52,670
Safe.

3954
02:00:52,770 --> 02:00:53,510
Left side?

3955
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:54,050
Left side?

3956
02:00:55,110 --> 02:00:55,750
Safe.

3957
02:00:56,150 --> 02:00:56,530
Safe.

3958
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:58,050
History-m.

3959
02:00:58,390 --> 02:00:59,370
History-m.

3960
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:01,230
Streaming...

3961
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:03,250
Floor, nothing.

3962
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:04,870
Ceiling, nothing.

3963
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:05,890
Exit.

3964
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:06,230
Brother...

3965
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:07,130
Water.

3966
02:01:07,530 --> 02:01:08,210
Planting.

3967
02:01:08,210 --> 02:01:10,070
Brother, not pregnant anymore.

3968
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:15,610
He has had the babies.

3969
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:17,210
He's had the babies.

3970
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:18,730
It was...

3971
02:01:19,070 --> 02:01:20,690
It wasn't a bullet all along.

3972
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:21,710
It was like an egg.

3973
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:22,690
You are kidding.

3974
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,610
What happened to the baby?

3975
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:28,670
It's like being washed out there.

3976
02:01:28,670 --> 02:01:30,590
Yeah, they're in the baby ward.

3977
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:31,790
The baby ward.

3978
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:32,370
Yeah.

3979
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:33,890
The ward for all you guys.

3980
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:34,970
The big baby ward.

3981
02:01:38,670 --> 02:01:39,930
Alright, it's time.

3982
02:01:40,450 --> 02:01:40,970
Brother!

3983
02:01:41,190 --> 02:01:41,710
Brother!

3984
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:42,150
Still the same.

3985
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:42,730
Oh.

3986
02:01:43,870 --> 02:01:44,390
Um...

3987
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:45,670
Help me.

3988
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:47,370
Help me.

3989
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:47,970
Help me.

3990
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:48,870
Help.

3991
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:49,690
I'm gonna drown.

3992
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,710
I'm gonna die.

3993
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:51,330
I'm gonna drown.

3994
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:52,410
I'm gonna...

3995
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:53,110
The door is gonna open.

3996
02:01:53,110 --> 02:01:53,970
I'm gonna drown.

3997
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:54,950
I'm gonna die.

3998
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:56,390
The door is gonna open.

3999
02:01:56,410 --> 02:01:56,790
I'm gonna...

4000
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:57,670
It's gonna open.

4001
02:01:58,030 --> 02:01:58,650
I'm gonna...

4002
02:01:58,650 --> 02:01:58,990
I'm gonna drown.

4003
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:00,090
I'm gonna die.

4004
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:00,950
I'm gonna drown.

4005
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,390
I'm gonna die.

4006
02:02:02,670 --> 02:02:04,410
You're doing great, sweetie.

4007
02:02:04,730 --> 02:02:05,710
See, I told you.

4008
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:06,010
There we go.

4009
02:02:06,330 --> 02:02:06,850
God.

4010
02:02:07,170 --> 02:02:09,110
She's such an overreacting.

4011
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:09,690
Those were...

4012
02:02:09,690 --> 02:02:13,150
Those were all my wisps tears when I don't start the stream.

4013
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:15,730
She hates us.

4014
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:21,310
What an overreaction.

4015
02:02:21,370 --> 02:02:23,050
It was saying that she was gonna die.

4016
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:23,430
You know what?

4017
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:24,490
I get those...

4018
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:25,050
Those...

4019
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:26,730
Those anomalies a lot.

4020
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:30,490
I think it's because I'm not a big-ass, baby and I have to go into the room first.

4021
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:31,790
Look at this.

4022
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,470
Wait, has this always been white?

4023
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:34,030
The floor?

4024
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:36,070
It looks whiter than usual.

4025
02:02:36,490 --> 02:02:38,270
Yeah, it looks like extra bright.

4026
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:39,510
Oh, um...

4027
02:02:39,990 --> 02:02:41,270
You might want to get out of there.

4028
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:42,510
Why?

4029
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:43,250
What?

4030
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,970
What did you see?

4031
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:46,010
Wait, what did you see?

4032
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:46,590
Go back in.

4033
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:48,790
Okay, you have to go back in until you find the anomaly.

4034
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:49,670
No, no, no.

4035
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:50,310
I already found it.

4036
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:51,110
You go in.

4037
02:02:51,170 --> 02:02:51,530
You go in.

4038
02:02:51,670 --> 02:02:52,430
It's the floor.

4039
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:54,770
What did you...

4040
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:54,970
Oh!

4041
02:02:55,530 --> 02:02:55,890
Ah!

4042
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:56,710
Ah!

4043
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:57,570
Ah!

4044
02:02:57,610 --> 02:02:57,970
Ah!

4045
02:02:58,310 --> 02:02:59,850
Please stop the game if I get crushed!

4046
02:03:07,110 --> 02:03:11,270
So, I think the reason why it was whiter was because the ceiling was reflecting.

4047
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:12,490
The ceiling was closing in.

4048
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:13,550
It was getting brighter.

4049
02:03:14,610 --> 02:03:17,330
The light was getting closer to the floor.

4050
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:20,150
We managed to avoid drowning.

4051
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:22,110
Okay.

4052
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:23,870
And getting crushed.

4053
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:26,010
Okay, I went in first already, so it's your turn.

4054
02:03:26,030 --> 02:03:27,510
Okay, now it's my turn to go in first.

4055
02:03:28,570 --> 02:03:29,570
Brother, safe.

4056
02:03:30,210 --> 02:03:31,670
Computer, safe.

4057
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:33,370
Right side, safe.

4058
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:36,050
Left side, history-m.

4059
02:03:37,150 --> 02:03:38,270
History-m.

4060
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:42,070
Lights, not crushing us.

4061
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:44,050
Sink, di-jo-boo.

4062
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:47,990
Blow dryer, still unhygienic.

4063
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:50,250
Filled with germs.

4064
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:52,670
I think...

4065
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:53,850
I think we're safe.

4066
02:03:54,190 --> 02:03:55,690
Brother, give us a thumbs up if we're safe.

4067
02:03:56,730 --> 02:03:57,490
Then before we go in, let's go to the next room.

4068
02:03:57,510 --> 02:03:59,510
The most important thing is to, like, one anomaly outside.

4069
02:03:59,690 --> 02:04:00,470
I know, right?

4070
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:02,030
I feel like we should still be checking.

4071
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:03,710
But they didn't last time.

4072
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:05,090
So...

4073
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:05,830
Alright.

4074
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:07,350
This is it.

4075
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:07,970
Okay.

4076
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:09,890
Alright.

4077
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:11,410
311!

4078
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:14,810
311.

4079
02:04:16,830 --> 02:04:17,250
Yeah!

4080
02:04:17,710 --> 02:04:18,010
Yeah!

4081
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:20,870
How are hand dryers unhygienic?

4082
02:04:20,910 --> 02:04:23,430
Well if they're in a bathroom- Oh, you go in first this time.

4083
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:24,250
Alright.

4084
02:04:24,410 --> 02:04:27,490
If they're in a bathroom, they just blow all the germs off.

4085
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:28,230
...on to your hands.

4086
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:30,350
Right side, nothing.

4087
02:04:30,810 --> 02:04:32,070
Left side, safe.

4088
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:34,350
History...

4089
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:36,730
History... PC.

4090
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:39,250
Ground, nothing.

4091
02:04:39,790 --> 02:04:40,430
Sealing...

4092
02:04:40,430 --> 02:04:41,210
Brother, still there.

4093
02:04:41,590 --> 02:04:43,590
Brother, nothing in his brain.

4094
02:04:43,730 --> 02:04:45,290
Nothing going on in there.

4095
02:04:45,610 --> 02:04:46,150
Brother...

4096
02:04:46,150 --> 02:04:47,390
Brother...

4097
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:48,390
Brother's going through it.

4098
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:51,170
Wow, there's no way there's not an anomaly here.

4099
02:04:51,170 --> 02:04:52,670
There's not no anomaly still?

4100
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:55,390
Yeah, the poopy air gets blown around.

4101
02:04:55,630 --> 02:04:56,330
It's disgusting.

4102
02:04:57,510 --> 02:05:01,730
It's like when you have to change your toothbrush every couple of months.

4103
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:02,570
Yeah, months?

4104
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:03,330
Because like...

4105
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:06,530
Yeah, every couple of months you have to change your toothbrush.

4106
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:08,030
I thought it was more frequent than that.

4107
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:10,250
Wait, how frequent?

4108
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:12,590
Wait a minute.

4109
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:16,730
Wait a minute.

4110
02:05:19,550 --> 02:05:21,710
How frequent is it supposed to be?

4111
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:27,150
Someone said... I thought it was like every month or so.

4112
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:29,150
Someone said three months max.

4113
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:29,890
Okay, okay.

4114
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:30,670
Okay, okay.

4115
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:33,950
Wait, you change your toothbrush every month?

4116
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:39,010
Well, like I've been getting sick a lot, so I've been changing it a lot recently.

4117
02:05:39,170 --> 02:05:39,570
Okay.

4118
02:05:41,230 --> 02:05:42,330
Not every year?

4119
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:46,090
Not every three to four years?

4120
02:05:48,430 --> 02:05:49,610
It's like a mattress.

4121
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:51,390
You're just supposed to flip it upside down.

4122
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:54,310
You're not supposed to get a new mattress.

4123
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:55,070
You just flip it.

4124
02:05:55,150 --> 02:05:55,430
Yeah.

4125
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,490
Okay, for those who don't know...

4126
02:05:57,510 --> 02:06:00,390
Why I had to change my toothbrush every couple of months...

4127
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:01,610
It's because like...

4128
02:06:01,610 --> 02:06:04,050
You know how you're using your bathroom and you're flushing?

4129
02:06:04,630 --> 02:06:04,990
Yeah.

4130
02:06:06,150 --> 02:06:06,510
Yeah.

4131
02:06:07,090 --> 02:06:09,830
If it's all in the same room, you're gonna want to change...

4132
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:10,070
Wait.

4133
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,910
What?

4134
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:12,670
Is that alive?

4135
02:06:13,450 --> 02:06:13,810
Or...

4136
02:06:13,810 --> 02:06:15,130
Hey, hey, it's a good thing.

4137
02:06:15,330 --> 02:06:15,650
Oh, it's a cat!

4138
02:06:15,910 --> 02:06:16,710
You don't get to see the cat.

4139
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:17,770
Oh, wait, there's one next to you!

4140
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:18,490
There's one next to you!

4141
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:19,150
He's...

4142
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:20,190
Wait, what is happening?

4143
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,450
Oh my god, he's dying.

4144
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:22,790
He's just dying.

4145
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:23,850
Oh my god.

4146
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:24,870
Wait, there's another one.

4147
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:26,270
There's another one over here.

4148
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:27,430
There's a witch in the universe!

4149
02:06:27,770 --> 02:06:28,430
There's a one...

4150
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:29,610
There's one under the couch too.

4151
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,710
Wait, they're all just dying.

4152
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:33,030
What's going on?

4153
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:33,410
What's going on?

4154
02:06:33,730 --> 02:06:34,970
Dies of cringe.

4155
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:37,650
They see us.

4156
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:40,470
They're like, no documentary here.

4157
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:43,090
Dies of cringe.

4158
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:46,690
They haven't changed their toothbrush in over...

4159
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:54,770
So yeah, you have to change your toothbrush every couple of months because when you're flushing, you know, stuff goes out.

4160
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:56,010
You're ingesting that, man.

4161
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:56,230
Yeah.

4162
02:06:56,770 --> 02:06:58,110
That's why you close your mouth.

4163
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:59,110
You open your mouth?

4164
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:00,370
When...

4165
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:00,910
What do you mean?

4166
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:03,970
When I brush my teeth?

4167
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:05,310
How else do you brush your teeth?

4168
02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:06,470
Oh, okay.

4169
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:10,230
It's not like, you know, when you're flushing, you like, mouth open and like...

4170
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:12,890
No, I just mouth open over the seat, you know?

4171
02:07:18,690 --> 02:07:19,510
That's why...

4172
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:20,770
That's why you gotta...

4173
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,870
Six!

4174
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:23,450
Six!

4175
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:24,850
Where's the other six?

4176
02:07:24,910 --> 02:07:25,790
Where's the third six?

4177
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:26,590
Six is here.

4178
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:27,130
You found it?

4179
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:27,370
Six is over there.

4180
02:07:27,590 --> 02:07:28,570
Six-six-six!

4181
02:07:28,570 --> 02:07:28,890
Six -six-six!

4182
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:30,710
We're going to make it!

4183
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:36,610
Someone's like, wait, you change your toothbrush?

4184
02:07:37,070 --> 02:07:37,190
No.

4185
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:38,590
Oh, no.

4186
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:41,310
You don't change your toothbrush until the bristles are all frayed?

4187
02:07:41,490 --> 02:07:42,310
What do you mean?

4188
02:07:42,890 --> 02:07:44,350
That's why I don't flush.

4189
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:47,430
No!

4190
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:48,290
No!

4191
02:07:51,050 --> 02:07:51,930
All right.

4192
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,250
Okay.

4193
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:54,430
Oh, brother is huge.

4194
02:07:54,470 --> 02:07:54,830
Oh, brother is huge.

4195
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:55,570
Brother is huge.

4196
02:07:55,590 --> 02:07:55,770
Oh, brother is huge.

4197
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:01,730
I love how we could tell immediately.

4198
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:06,150
We were like, brother, brother, we're supposed to be the same size.

4199
02:08:06,270 --> 02:08:09,310
Brother, you can't drink more milk than us like this.

4200
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:09,950
Come on, man.

4201
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:12,670
Yo, he's been doing too much protein shakes.

4202
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:16,990
Brother, you've been going to the gym without us?

4203
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:17,770
It's not fair!

4204
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:19,530
Brother is going to join basketball.

4205
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:22,470
He's on the hospital basketball team.

4206
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:23,450
Oh shit, we're almost to 16.

4207
02:08:23,450 --> 02:08:25,130
We're at almost 16.

4208
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:26,150
Let's go.

4209
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:27,290
Oh my god.

4210
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:29,230
He's big.

4211
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:31,010
Okay, okay.

4212
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:32,950
Okay, alright.

4213
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:35,270
Brother's the same height.

4214
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:38,150
Oh, yeah.

4215
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:39,850
Oh, what the hell is that?

4216
02:08:40,190 --> 02:08:41,370
I think it's following you.

4217
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:42,430
Does it rush over?

4218
02:08:43,410 --> 02:08:45,150
Oh, wait, what is going on?

4219
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:45,490
Oh!

4220
02:08:46,110 --> 02:08:47,430
Wait, will it stab us?

4221
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:48,250
I can't.

4222
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:49,410
Oh, they're growing bigger!

4223
02:08:50,310 --> 02:08:51,170
Oh my god!

4224
02:08:51,330 --> 02:08:52,890
Oh my god, it's like a...

4225
02:08:53,450 --> 02:08:54,050
Oh, wait, it's cheesy!

4226
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:59,410
Oh my god, it's protecting its babies!

4227
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:04,510
It's protecting the babies!

4228
02:09:04,590 --> 02:09:05,270
It's like those...

4229
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:06,550
That was...

4230
02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:07,090
It's like bears.

4231
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:08,150
It was a brother.

4232
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:12,130
Alright, last floor.

4233
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:13,410
Last floor, baby!

4234
02:09:13,670 --> 02:09:14,490
Until we're at 400.

4235
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:18,190
All we have to do is... the ones we're at 400...

4236
02:09:18,190 --> 02:09:18,970
Oh, yeah, definitely.

4237
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:20,890
What's behind... what do you think is over there?

4238
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:21,830
I'm going to look.

4239
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:22,310
I'm going to look.

4240
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:22,450
Let's look.

4241
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:22,710
Let's look.

4242
02:09:22,830 --> 02:09:23,250
What is it?

4243
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:23,690
Oh!

4244
02:09:23,970 --> 02:09:24,330
Oh.

4245
02:09:24,970 --> 02:09:25,590
What is it?

4246
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:26,210
Oh.

4247
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:27,190
I don't want to die, though.

4248
02:09:27,290 --> 02:09:28,410
Because I don't want to redo everything.

4249
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:30,330
No, there was nothing behind it.

4250
02:09:30,330 --> 02:09:31,030
There was nothing behind it.

4251
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:32,350
Oh, there's nothing behind it?

4252
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:32,670
Yeah.

4253
02:09:32,730 --> 02:09:33,370
You really check.

4254
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:34,490
You could go look.

4255
02:09:34,790 --> 02:09:35,450
You actually check.

4256
02:09:35,450 --> 02:09:36,470
You don't trust me?

4257
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:37,090
Come on.

4258
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:37,970
No, I trust you.

4259
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,610
I trust you.

4260
02:09:38,610 --> 02:09:39,510
I just wanted to show you.

4261
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:39,870
Toki!

4262
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:40,150
Toki!

4263
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:41,510
I can't believe you don't trust me.

4264
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:41,710
I trust you.

4265
02:09:41,970 --> 02:09:42,990
You don't trust me.

4266
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:45,090
You always look at the stuff I looked at.

4267
02:09:45,090 --> 02:09:46,490
I hope you don't die this time again.

4268
02:09:46,950 --> 02:09:47,550
Oh, yeah.

4269
02:09:47,610 --> 02:09:49,510
Sorry for sacrificing my life for you.

4270
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:51,170
Wait, what's in here?

4271
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:51,970
What's in here?

4272
02:09:51,970 --> 02:09:52,470
I don't know.

4273
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:54,610
I just saw, like, PC monitors in the toilet.

4274
02:09:54,930 --> 02:09:55,130
Wait.

4275
02:09:55,290 --> 02:09:56,850
Oh, we have to open the doors.

4276
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:58,330
Oh.

4277
02:09:58,410 --> 02:09:59,050
Uh-oh.

4278
02:09:59,130 --> 02:09:59,530
Uh-oh.

4279
02:09:59,530 --> 02:09:59,950
Uh-oh.

4280
02:10:00,230 --> 02:10:00,710
Oh!

4281
02:10:00,810 --> 02:10:01,290
Oh!

4282
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:02,690
What the fuck?

4283
02:10:04,110 --> 02:10:05,950
That was your door!

4284
02:10:06,450 --> 02:10:08,410
That was your door!

4285
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:11,030
Wait, but we just restart.

4286
02:10:11,130 --> 02:10:11,730
It's fine.

4287
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:12,490
Uh-oh.

4288
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:13,230
Sorry.

4289
02:10:13,490 --> 02:10:14,510
What do you mean?

4290
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:15,950
Just run away.

4291
02:10:17,130 --> 02:10:18,670
What do you mean?

4292
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:20,110
Oh, Skippity.

4293
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:20,810
Hey, Skippity.

4294
02:10:20,810 --> 02:10:21,290
Wait, actually...

4295
02:10:21,290 --> 02:10:21,610
Skippity!

4296
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:21,930
Skippity!

4297
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:21,950
Skippity!

4298
02:10:21,970 --> 02:10:22,930
Oh, you missed it.

4299
02:10:22,970 --> 02:10:23,670
Oh, Boomer missed it.

4300
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:24,610
This one is empty, though.

4301
02:10:26,690 --> 02:10:28,050
I can't believe it.

4302
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:28,910
The Boomer missed it.

4303
02:10:28,910 --> 02:10:29,350
Oh, it's flooding.

4304
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:30,050
It's flooding.

4305
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:30,850
Is that you?

4306
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:32,950
No, that was not me.

4307
02:10:33,070 --> 02:10:34,090
I did not open...

4308
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:37,250
Why does all the doors you open end up killing us?

4309
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:37,970
It's not me!

4310
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:40,610
What do you mean it's not you?

4311
02:10:40,690 --> 02:10:40,930
You...

4312
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:42,850
Every door you open...

4313
02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:43,590
Just keep opening!

4314
02:10:43,810 --> 02:10:44,490
Just keep opening!

4315
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:45,710
I am!

4316
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:46,690
Who's laughing?

4317
02:10:47,170 --> 02:10:47,870
Oh, my God.

4318
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:48,710
It's not going inside.

4319
02:10:48,730 --> 02:10:49,070
Oh, no.

4320
02:10:49,410 --> 02:10:50,230
Oh, no.

4321
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:51,930
Oh, no.

4322
02:10:52,030 --> 02:10:53,150
We're gonna drown!

4323
02:10:54,590 --> 02:10:56,210
My toilet's laughing at me.

4324
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:58,230
My toilet's laughing at me, too!

4325
02:10:58,550 --> 02:10:59,550
Oh, I found it!

4326
02:10:59,610 --> 02:11:00,070
I found it!

4327
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:00,630
You found it?

4328
02:11:00,630 --> 02:11:01,150
Where, where, where?

4329
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:03,090
Where are you?

4330
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:05,310
Come on, hurry up!

4331
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:06,450
Oh, shit.

4332
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:07,210
Oh, my God.

4333
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:10,630
Hurry up.

4334
02:11:10,670 --> 02:11:13,770
You don't even say where we're at and you say hurry up.

4335
02:11:15,610 --> 02:11:17,970
Thanks for the instructions there, man.

4336
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:19,290
Wait, is this the same room?

4337
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:19,690
Oh, no.

4338
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:20,210
We're in the same room.

4339
02:11:20,230 --> 02:11:20,870
We're in the toilet now.

4340
02:11:20,890 --> 02:11:21,030
We're in the toilet.

4341
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:23,570
Our brother needs privacy.

4342
02:11:25,830 --> 02:11:26,330
Brother!

4343
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:29,430
Oh, we're gonna have to check inside every single...

4344
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:30,190
I don't think so.

4345
02:11:30,330 --> 02:11:30,990
Oh, my God!

4346
02:11:30,990 --> 02:11:31,470
Look at us!

4347
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:32,830
That's us!

4348
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:34,010
Family portrait!

4349
02:11:34,730 --> 02:11:37,190
Look at family photo in the bathroom, everybody!

4350
02:11:37,570 --> 02:11:39,250
Meet and greet in the bathroom!

4351
02:11:39,730 --> 02:11:40,470
Six toilets?

4352
02:11:40,650 --> 02:11:41,550
There's six of everything.

4353
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:44,170
There's even six sinks!

4354
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:45,970
Oh, my God.

4355
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:47,630
And there's six blow dryers.

4356
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:48,370
Ew.

4357
02:11:49,330 --> 02:11:50,890
They're right next to the toilet.

4358
02:11:51,110 --> 02:11:53,570
They're gonna blow that into your hand.

4359
02:11:53,570 --> 02:11:55,030
Brother, do you have enough toilet paper?

4360
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:58,470
I like how the kids sink is next to the urinal.

4361
02:11:58,910 --> 02:12:00,310
Okay, this one's gotta be easy.

4362
02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:01,750
There's like nothing in here, right, guys?

4363
02:12:02,010 --> 02:12:02,410
Yeah.

4364
02:12:02,410 --> 02:12:02,910
I think we got this.

4365
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:03,210
It has to be.

4366
02:12:03,490 --> 02:12:04,490
Idle meeting time.

4367
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:05,630
We can speed run this to 600.

4368
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:06,830
We can speed run this.

4369
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:07,110
Yeah.

4370
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:08,830
We're literally so close to the end.

4371
02:12:09,070 --> 02:12:10,430
I think we're actually, yeah.

4372
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:10,590
200 more floors.

4373
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:14,170
We're like masters now.

4374
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:15,310
Oh, my God.

4375
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:17,710
We're the masters of the universe.

4376
02:12:18,110 --> 02:12:19,230
I don't know about that.

4377
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,750
What do you mean?

4378
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:22,530
The mirror will be fun.

4379
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:22,790
The fastest.

4380
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:23,810
Oh, don't say that.

4381
02:12:24,190 --> 02:12:24,910
Don't say that.

4382
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:25,750
How would you know?

4383
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:28,430
Check the mirror.

4384
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:28,770
Oh.

4385
02:12:28,830 --> 02:12:29,530
Check the mirror.

4386
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:29,710
Oh.

4387
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:30,370
Oh, there's blood.

4388
02:12:30,610 --> 02:12:31,010
Oh.

4389
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:31,490
Oh.

4390
02:12:31,630 --> 02:12:32,810
There's more than just blood.

4391
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:33,990
There's more than just blood.

4392
02:12:34,030 --> 02:12:35,970
Those hands are like coming out of the wall.

4393
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:36,630
Yeah.

4394
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:37,930
It's like a PNG.

4395
02:12:38,070 --> 02:12:39,990
He's holding a PNG of the air vent.

4396
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:42,570
They're supposed to be like behind the vent.

4397
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:43,530
Wait.

4398
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:44,830
Does that mean vents are fake?

4399
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:46,250
Like they don't leave anywhere?

4400
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:47,750
There's no ventilation?

4401
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:48,990
Oh, my.

4402
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:49,290
Wait.

4403
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:50,910
There's no ventilation in the bathroom?

4404
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:51,530
Yeah.

4405
02:12:51,730 --> 02:12:53,610
That's not hygienic at all.

4406
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:56,970
All right.

4407
02:13:00,810 --> 02:13:02,110
That's how we don't say anything.

4408
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:03,270
We just run around.

4409
02:13:04,570 --> 02:13:06,110
Just the 180.

4410
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:07,110
I was like, all right.

4411
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:08,790
That's an anomaly, right?

4412
02:13:09,050 --> 02:13:10,150
Doki, I have to pee.

4413
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:11,390
Oh.

4414
02:13:11,490 --> 02:13:11,950
Okay.

4415
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:12,290
Don't worry.

4416
02:13:12,370 --> 02:13:13,530
I'll do this for us.

4417
02:13:13,890 --> 02:13:14,810
Don't die in there.

4418
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:15,110
Okay?

4419
02:13:15,150 --> 02:13:15,190
Don't.

4420
02:13:15,270 --> 02:13:15,910
Just stay there.

4421
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:16,550
Just stay there.

4422
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:22,680
What if I just die?

4423
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:24,360
Don't die.

4424
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:26,320
Why are you still here?

4425
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:26,860
Okay.

4426
02:13:26,940 --> 02:13:27,500
I'll be right back.

4427
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:28,340
Okay.

4428
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:28,720
Hold on.

4429
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:29,380
Hold on, guys.

4430
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:29,740
Sorry.

4431
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:32,400
Were you guys waiting to see if I get it?

4432
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:35,340
Oh, okay.

4433
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:36,280
There was no anomalies.

4434
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:36,940
Wait.

4435
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:38,640
Has there always been three trash cans down here?

4436
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,440
Why is there a trash can down here?

4437
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,620
I didn't look down, guys.

4438
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:45,560
I didn't.

4439
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:46,260
Guys.

4440
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:47,120
This is the only way.

4441
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:48,300
There's always been three trash cans.

4442
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:49,620
I didn't look down.

4443
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:52,760
Yeah?

4444
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:53,440
Wait.

4445
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:54,740
Why would the trash cans be here?

4446
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:56,220
Okay.

4447
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,720
There's always been three trash cans.

4448
02:13:57,740 --> 02:13:57,900
Two.

4449
02:13:57,980 --> 02:13:58,300
Four.

4450
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:58,820
No.

4451
02:13:58,920 --> 02:13:59,940
We have to start counting.

4452
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:00,840
Two.

4453
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:01,220
Four.

4454
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:01,560
Six.

4455
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:02,720
Two.

4456
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:03,600
Four.

4457
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:04,580
Wait.

4458
02:14:04,700 --> 02:14:05,240
Where's five?

4459
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:06,160
Two.

4460
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:06,720
Four.

4461
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:07,200
Six.

4462
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:07,640
Okay.

4463
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:09,520
Two.

4464
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:12,940
Four.

4465
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:13,680
Five.

4466
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,400
Where's the six?

4467
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:15,420
There's a six broom.

4468
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:17,040
Two.

4469
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:17,880
Oh.

4470
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:18,180
Sorry.

4471
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:18,500
Two.

4472
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:18,680
Four.

4473
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:18,940
Six.

4474
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:19,240
Two.

4475
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:21,660
Two.

4476
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:22,940
Four.

4477
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,120
Where's the six trash can?

4478
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:27,400
Six.

4479
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:27,760
Okay.

4480
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:29,000
There's six of everything.

4481
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:29,820
Two.

4482
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:30,520
Four.

4483
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:30,740
Five.

4484
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:30,900
Wait.

4485
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:31,320
There's five.

4486
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:31,660
Oh.

4487
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:31,880
Six.

4488
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:32,460
That's a...

4489
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:33,340
Okay.

4490
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:34,820
One.

4491
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:35,320
Two.

4492
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:35,880
Three.

4493
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:36,340
Four.

4494
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:36,800
Five.

4495
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:37,080
Six.

4496
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:37,940
I think we did it.

4497
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:38,960
No anomalies.

4498
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:40,660
No anomalies.

4499
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:47,640
There's a seven urinal?

4500
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:50,060
There's a seven urinal?

4501
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:51,740
I don't know.

4502
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:52,520
Two.

4503
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:53,740
There's six urinals.

4504
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:54,820
Someone can't even count.

4505
02:14:55,460 --> 02:14:56,120
All right.

4506
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:57,260
I think we're good.

4507
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,440
I think there's no anomalies.

4508
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:02,120
Wow.

4509
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:03,520
Min is so slow.

4510
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,400
Of course.

4511
02:15:04,420 --> 02:15:07,700
Of course she goes to the bathroom when there's no anomalies.

4512
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,060
Look at her.

4513
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:12,900
Was there...

4514
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:13,360
Yes.

4515
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:17,120
There was six toilets because the whole game is based off of...

4516
02:15:17,140 --> 02:15:17,460
Six.

4517
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:17,880
Six.

4518
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:18,280
Six.

4519
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:19,420
So there's six of everything.

4520
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:19,460
Hold on.

4521
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:20,280
I gotta get tea.

4522
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:21,100
Hold on.

4523
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:21,540
Hold on.

4524
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:22,640
Min, don't come over here.

4525
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:23,040
No.

4526
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:23,320
Min.

4527
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:25,000
There's no anomalies.

4528
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:25,780
Get over here.

4529
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,080
No.

4530
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:29,100
You can't just...

4531
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,640
What do you mean you have to get tea?

4532
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:35,840
There's no anomaly.

4533
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:40,740
If only I could just leave.

4534
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:44,420
Oh my God.

4535
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:45,560
Oh, I can push it.

4536
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:46,000
You're right.

4537
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:46,840
Oh my God.

4538
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:47,120
Why didn't I push it?

4539
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:48,320
Why didn't you guys tell that... say that earlier?

4540
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:49,820
Oh my God.

4541
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:51,000
I could have just pushed it.

4542
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:52,140
I can't believe it.

4543
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:54,620
I could have done that in the very beginning.

4544
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:58,140
I messed up.

4545
02:15:58,540 --> 02:15:58,960
Wait.

4546
02:15:59,020 --> 02:15:59,180
No.

4547
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,020
Okay.

4548
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:01,040
There we go.

4549
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:04,620
All right.

4550
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:06,780
We're getting you to the other side.

4551
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:12,340
All right.

4552
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:13,480
Nice.

4553
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:14,380
We did it.

4554
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:16,140
We're professionals.

4555
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:16,580
Okay.

4556
02:16:16,660 --> 02:16:17,100
I gotta...

4557
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:17,880
I gotta like make sure.

4558
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:18,980
Okay.

4559
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:19,820
In case...

4560
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:20,600
In case there's...

4561
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,120
There is an anomaly.

4562
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,580
Or there's no anomaly as well.

4563
02:16:25,460 --> 02:16:25,940
Okay.

4564
02:16:25,940 --> 02:16:26,160
No.

4565
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:27,640
All right.

4566
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:28,520
Here we go.

4567
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:30,000
I'm gaming.

4568
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:33,080
All right.

4569
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:35,040
Everything looks the same.

4570
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:35,360
I'm back.

4571
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:36,840
Oh my God.

4572
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:38,300
You scared the shit out of me.

4573
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:41,500
I had to push you to the other side of the elevator.

4574
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:43,700
Everything looks good.

4575
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:45,260
There was no anomaly.

4576
02:16:45,260 --> 02:16:46,140
You had plenty of time.

4577
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:46,520
You had...

4578
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:46,940
I'm gonna chill.

4579
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:47,100
I'm gonna chill.

4580
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:47,220
I'm gonna double check.

4581
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:48,120
I don't trust you.

4582
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:49,080
What do you mean?

4583
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:50,900
We're on the other floor now.

4584
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:51,180
Oh.

4585
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:51,420
Nope.

4586
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:51,700
Oh.

4587
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:52,040
Nope.

4588
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:52,620
No.

4589
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:54,960
What do you mean?

4590
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:55,420
Oh.

4591
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,500
Let me double check.

4592
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:57,940
This is a new floor.

4593
02:16:58,400 --> 02:16:58,960
Come on.

4594
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:00,880
Let's hurry it up.

4595
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:04,480
I literally pushed you from one elevator to another.

4596
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:08,660
All right.

4597
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:09,160
Here we go.

4598
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:10,940
Was she brave, you guys?

4599
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:11,580
Be honest.

4600
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:13,020
I was so brave.

4601
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:13,620
I counted.

4602
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:15,180
I learned how to count today.

4603
02:17:15,480 --> 02:17:15,740
Really?

4604
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,100
I learned my ABC's.

4605
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:18,360
You took your counting medicine.

4606
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:19,380
Yeah.

4607
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:20,440
I took my counting medicine.

4608
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:21,580
Okay.

4609
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:24,960
I just realized we have to count these items as well because like...

4610
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:25,000
I also...

4611
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:25,080
Yeah.

4612
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:26,800
How many trash cans were there?

4613
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:27,060
Six.

4614
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:27,380
Six?

4615
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:27,660
Okay.

4616
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:28,300
Yeah.

4617
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:28,640
It's six.

4618
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:29,000
Oh, seven.

4619
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:29,900
No, there's seven.

4620
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:32,840
Two, four, six.

4621
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:33,520
What do you mean?

4622
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:34,140
There's six.

4623
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:36,160
Someone didn't learn to count.

4624
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:37,700
It's me.

4625
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,940
I didn't learn how to count.

4626
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:43,960
Someone didn't learn.

4627
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:44,160
Two, four, six.

4628
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:46,200
It's like in every single little stop.

4629
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:47,100
Two, four, six.

4630
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,400
Two, four, six.

4631
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,780
Two, four, six.

4632
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:52,920
I think we're good.

4633
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:54,420
I think we're good too.

4634
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:56,540
I'm pretty sure.

4635
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:56,980
I think so.

4636
02:17:58,820 --> 02:17:59,880
Back to kindergarten.

4637
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,860
Min didn't take her counting medicine.

4638
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:03,840
That's okay.

4639
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:05,360
Send me back to kindergarten.

4640
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:07,940
Let me be a child again.

4641
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:11,680
All right.

4642
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:13,160
Yay!

4643
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:14,040
4-0-6.

4644
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:15,980
4-0-6.

4645
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:16,380
Oh, six.

4646
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:17,100
4-0-6.

4647
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:18,080
4-0-6.

4648
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:19,840
4-0-6.

4649
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:20,260
4-0-6.

4650
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:22,860
That's pretty impressive you were able to punch me all the way.

4651
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:23,380
I'm trying to make sure.

4652
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:23,720
Yeah.

4653
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,160
What was that?

4654
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:31,460
What was that?

4655
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:32,660
It was the blow dryers.

4656
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:33,540
Oh my God.

4657
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:36,900
The blow dryer.

4658
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:39,840
It scared me so bad I couldn't even make a noise.

4659
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:40,840
I was like...

4660
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:42,640
It's just like, whoa, shit.

4661
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:44,720
I thought it was something chasing us.

4662
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:47,080
We talked too much shit about the blow dryer.

4663
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:47,740
Blow dryers, guys.

4664
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:50,220
Okay.

4665
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:51,880
All right.

4666
02:18:51,980 --> 02:18:52,660
We're still normal.

4667
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:53,580
There's going to be something in here.

4668
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:55,000
2-4.

4669
02:18:55,660 --> 02:18:56,720
Let's test her counting.

4670
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:57,020
Brother.

4671
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:57,640
2-4-6.

4672
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:00,440
2-4-6.

4673
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:02,360
2-4-6.

4674
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:06,080
Oh, we have to make sure to look between the toilets too.

4675
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:06,100
Yeah.

4676
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:06,600
I looked in between.

4677
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:09,100
Why is this toilet like filled with...

4678
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:09,980
There's always...

4679
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:11,180
Wasn't there always a toilet in here?

4680
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:11,740
Yeah.

4681
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:15,000
Isn't this like the handicap slot too?

4682
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:15,660
Yeah.

4683
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:16,560
Because it's a bigger doll.

4684
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:17,040
Yeah.

4685
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:17,060
So...

4686
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:17,280
It's a bigger doll.

4687
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:17,620
Yeah.

4688
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:19,260
That's so messed up.

4689
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:20,260
They did not care.

4690
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:21,480
This is a hospital.

4691
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:23,140
There's so many people in wheelchairs.

4692
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:23,160
Yeah.

4693
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:24,980
There's so many people in wheelchairs.

4694
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:26,660
And yet they filled it up.

4695
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:27,260
Look up.

4696
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:28,040
I'm looking up.

4697
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,260
2 -4 -6.

4698
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:29,960
I mean, we counted everything.

4699
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:30,860
There's six lights.

4700
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:31,920
2-4.

4701
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:32,180
Wait.

4702
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:32,320
No.

4703
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:33,000
There's eight lights.

4704
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:34,620
Has there always been eight lights?

4705
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:38,980
I don't think it's that meticulous, right?

4706
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:39,860
I don't think so either.

4707
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:40,660
Yeah.

4708
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:40,920
Yeah.

4709
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,120
Yeah.

4710
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:42,780
There's a bloody handprint.

4711
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,200
What do you mean bloody handprint?

4712
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:45,140
Where?

4713
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:46,860
Everybody's spamming handprint.

4714
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:47,640
Handprint?

4715
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:49,420
Is it in the toilet maybe?

4716
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:50,360
Okay.

4717
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:51,920
Did anyone spam handprint on your chat?

4718
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:54,880
There are four lights.

4719
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:55,820
What do you mean?

4720
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:56,860
There's four lights.

4721
02:19:56,860 --> 02:19:58,120
Handprint by the kid's urinal.

4722
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:59,340
There's a kid's urinal?

4723
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:00,940
There's a kid's urinal?

4724
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:01,780
There is.

4725
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,140
They're just saying that the...

4726
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:03,560
Oh!

4727
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,080
Oh!

4728
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,460
That's not a urinal.

4729
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:07,080
That's a...

4730
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:07,880
Wait.

4731
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:10,600
There's also like a...

4732
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:11,120
There's something...

4733
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:11,460
Yeah.

4734
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:12,920
There's something in the trash can.

4735
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:13,340
Wow.

4736
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:14,000
That's sneaky.

4737
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:15,120
What?

4738
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:16,220
Oh, that was a sneaky one.

4739
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:17,520
Is it a hand?

4740
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:18,360
I can't...

4741
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:19,020
I'm trying to see it.

4742
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:19,340
I think it was.

4743
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:20,020
Yeah.

4744
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:21,000
I'm pretty sure it's a hand.

4745
02:20:21,480 --> 02:20:22,880
We're not shortened at the seat.

4746
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:23,380
We're not a chat.

4747
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:25,900
We now know someone in the chat pees in sinks.

4748
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:30,040
Someone.

4749
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:34,180
Someone uses the kid's urinal to pee in the sink.

4750
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:38,980
I don't think it's versus allowed near the kid's hospital.

4751
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:43,460
Someone's peeing in sinks over here.

4752
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:44,080
Oh.

4753
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:44,360
Oh.

4754
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:44,400
Oh.

4755
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:44,480
Oh.

4756
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:44,620
Oh.

4757
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:45,260
You're right.

4758
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:45,740
In public.

4759
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:46,300
You're in public.

4760
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:47,000
What if you stand there?

4761
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:47,900
I dare you to stand there.

4762
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:49,240
Stand where?

4763
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:50,840
Over there?

4764
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:52,060
Wait.

4765
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:53,040
There's a shadow over there.

4766
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:53,300
Yeah.

4767
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:53,540
Stand on...

4768
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,500
I triple dog dare you.

4769
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,440
I already dared you.

4770
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:56,240
Oh.

4771
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,340
It's gone.

4772
02:20:57,640 --> 02:20:58,040
Oh.

4773
02:20:58,100 --> 02:20:58,460
It's gone.

4774
02:20:58,740 --> 02:20:59,140
Oh.

4775
02:20:59,180 --> 02:20:59,540
It's back.

4776
02:20:59,660 --> 02:20:59,980
Wait.

4777
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:00,180
Wait.

4778
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:00,280
Wait.

4779
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:00,720
It's back.

4780
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:01,340
That's your turn.

4781
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:02,380
Oh.

4782
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:02,720
It's gone.

4783
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:03,960
You like absorbed him.

4784
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:04,280
Yeah.

4785
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:04,440
Yeah.

4786
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:04,800
You too.

4787
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:20,460
Even... yeah, we didn't get help from chat at all, like...

4788
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:23,760
Yeah, yeah, we got like... we've like never failed.

4789
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:25,720
We literally have never failed!

4790
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:28,420
Yeah, we've been consistent throughout this.

4791
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:30,680
This game is just a really long game.

4792
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:32,880
Why do you run past the door?

4793
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:34,000
Why did you say...

4794
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:34,240
Oh!

4795
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:34,640
Oh!

4796
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:36,440
Brother!

4797
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:36,960
Brother!

4798
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:38,160
Brother, it's okay!

4799
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:38,460
Brother!

4800
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:39,920
Brother, it's okay!

4801
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:41,180
It's a miracle!

4802
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:45,930
Brother has risen!

4803
02:21:47,070 --> 02:21:50,650
On the fourth day, he rises!

4804
02:21:53,710 --> 02:21:56,690
Metal Gear rising right there!

4805
02:21:57,430 --> 02:22:00,690
Oh my god, it's a miracle, guys!

4806
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:04,070
Why do you always run past... oh, okay.

4807
02:22:04,310 --> 02:22:06,150
Someone peed in the urinals for me.

4808
02:22:06,210 --> 02:22:08,430
Someone actually peed in the urinals.

4809
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:11,390
They mixed the juices up.

4810
02:22:11,790 --> 02:22:12,610
What are you talking...

4811
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:13,370
What do you mean by that?

4812
02:22:13,630 --> 02:22:16,330
What do you mean by that?

4813
02:22:16,390 --> 02:22:17,430
Only bros understand.

4814
02:22:17,970 --> 02:22:21,570
I don't think even bros will understand what you mean.

4815
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:23,330
Only bros know.

4816
02:22:29,570 --> 02:22:30,830
Alright, let's see.

4817
02:22:31,230 --> 02:22:34,110
Don't run past, just run... just run inside.

4818
02:22:34,370 --> 02:22:34,590
What?

4819
02:22:34,810 --> 02:22:35,970
Wait, there's something weird.

4820
02:22:36,350 --> 02:22:37,250
Something weird?

4821
02:22:37,490 --> 02:22:37,890
Oh!

4822
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:40,150
The caution signs are moving!

4823
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:41,130
Yeah!

4824
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:42,350
They're coming!

4825
02:22:42,410 --> 02:22:43,230
They're coming towards us!

4826
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:43,870
Wait, they're coming after us.

4827
02:22:43,870 --> 02:22:45,810
Wait, they're actually coming after us.

4828
02:22:46,010 --> 02:22:47,690
Wait, what would the caution signs do?

4829
02:22:47,770 --> 02:22:48,210
Wait, let's see.

4830
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:49,390
But what if we die?

4831
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:51,230
They're converging.

4832
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:51,770
What are they gonna do?

4833
02:22:51,790 --> 02:22:52,830
Fucking eat us?

4834
02:22:53,030 --> 02:22:54,050
They're converging.

4835
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:54,750
They're converging.

4836
02:22:54,910 --> 02:22:56,870
It's like a... like a mating ritual.

4837
02:22:57,790 --> 02:22:59,610
We're watching a mating ritual right now.

4838
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:00,230
Oh!

4839
02:23:00,570 --> 02:23:00,970
Nope.

4840
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:03,730
I don't wanna... I'm not their...

4841
02:23:03,730 --> 02:23:03,730
I'm not their mate!

4842
02:23:03,730 --> 02:23:04,830
I told you, it does nothing!

4843
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:06,010
I'm not their mate!

4844
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:07,790
Come on, it was a mate!

4845
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:10,230
I think they'll block the entrance, I think, right?

4846
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:10,570
Oh, maybe.

4847
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:12,370
Yeah, I think they're gonna block the exit.

4848
02:23:12,970 --> 02:23:13,890
Thank you for the rain!

4849
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:14,190
The floor is wet!

4850
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:14,910
Oh my god.

4851
02:23:15,350 --> 02:23:15,750
Maria!

4852
02:23:16,010 --> 02:23:16,710
Thank you for the rain!

4853
02:23:17,170 --> 02:23:18,210
The floor is wet!

4854
02:23:18,550 --> 02:23:19,390
The floor is wet?

4855
02:23:19,610 --> 02:23:19,790
Ew.

4856
02:23:20,050 --> 02:23:20,430
Mm-hmm.

4857
02:23:21,310 --> 02:23:23,210
From all the juices in the urinal.

4858
02:23:26,170 --> 02:23:27,430
Your words, not mine.

4859
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:29,110
See, I told you, you knew what it means!

4860
02:23:29,210 --> 02:23:29,890
I knew it!

4861
02:23:29,890 --> 02:23:30,070
See?

4862
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:30,590
Go ahead.

4863
02:23:30,610 --> 02:23:31,530
She knows what it means!

4864
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:32,690
Don't run past the door.

4865
02:23:32,750 --> 02:23:33,470
Just go straight in.

4866
02:23:33,970 --> 02:23:34,670
Don't run past.

4867
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:37,730
I've always... I've always walked in.

4868
02:23:37,950 --> 02:23:39,450
No, you haven't!

4869
02:23:39,450 --> 02:23:41,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

4870
02:23:41,230 --> 02:23:41,830
Literally every time!

4871
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:44,410
She's rewriting history right now.

4872
02:23:44,730 --> 02:23:44,810
No!

4873
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:48,750
She's rewriting history.

4874
02:23:50,770 --> 02:23:52,190
Two, four, six.

4875
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:53,290
There's six trash cans.

4876
02:23:53,630 --> 02:23:55,350
I think it's no anomaly.

4877
02:23:55,670 --> 02:23:57,290
I think this one's good.

4878
02:23:58,130 --> 02:23:58,930
I can't tell...

4879
02:23:58,930 --> 02:23:59,530
I'm looking up.

4880
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:02,830
Are the toilet seats up or are they normal?

4881
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:03,990
Yeah, they've always been up.

4882
02:24:04,190 --> 02:24:04,450
Okay.

4883
02:24:04,570 --> 02:24:05,670
It's a men's urinal.

4884
02:24:06,470 --> 02:24:07,990
The urinal's a urinal.

4885
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:08,710
It's different.

4886
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:10,170
I mean, it's a men's bathroom.

4887
02:24:12,130 --> 02:24:12,890
I guess.

4888
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:14,450
You okay, brother?

4889
02:24:14,770 --> 02:24:14,890
Those are cracked?

4890
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:16,430
There's no doors that's cracked.

4891
02:24:16,830 --> 02:24:17,670
What do you mean?

4892
02:24:17,930 --> 02:24:18,910
All the doors have been cracked.

4893
02:24:19,170 --> 02:24:19,530
Yeah.

4894
02:24:20,690 --> 02:24:22,330
Someone was like, saw something.

4895
02:24:22,510 --> 02:24:23,330
What did you see?

4896
02:24:23,830 --> 02:24:25,170
Did you take your meds?

4897
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:25,910
I saw something.

4898
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:26,530
I saw something.

4899
02:24:26,630 --> 02:24:27,450
I saw you.

4900
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:29,450
I saw something.

4901
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:32,710
Nothing in the mirror.

4902
02:24:34,250 --> 02:24:35,450
There's six of everything.

4903
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:36,290
Ah!

4904
02:24:36,430 --> 02:24:36,830
Ah!

4905
02:24:38,530 --> 02:24:39,890
Are you gaslighting?

4906
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:40,890
No, I'm not.

4907
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:41,650
I'm not.

4908
02:24:41,770 --> 02:24:42,050
Woo!

4909
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:48,370
He's like peek-a-boo.

4910
02:24:55,430 --> 02:24:56,070
Hello?

4911
02:25:00,770 --> 02:25:01,410
Hello?

4912
02:25:03,730 --> 02:25:04,370
Hello?

4913
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:04,550
Hello?

4914
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:05,830
I'm lagging!

4915
02:25:06,170 --> 02:25:06,810
Oh!

4916
02:25:08,530 --> 02:25:09,250
I'm lagging!

4917
02:25:09,470 --> 02:25:10,690
Discord has been weird today.

4918
02:25:10,910 --> 02:25:11,690
Discord has been weird today.

4919
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:13,710
No, my OBS is lagging too.

4920
02:25:14,810 --> 02:25:16,410
I think there's a big E in here.

4921
02:25:16,590 --> 02:25:17,570
I think there's a big one in here.

4922
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:19,710
Donkey crash?

4923
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:22,150
Oh no, I'm okay now.

4924
02:25:22,210 --> 02:25:22,550
I'm okay.

4925
02:25:22,950 --> 02:25:23,450
I'm okay.

4926
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:24,590
Oh my god.

4927
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:25,410
It was so scary.

4928
02:25:25,650 --> 02:25:28,950
It was so scary because I said that and then everything just stopped.

4929
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:32,610
Everything stopped moving and I was like, oh no.

4930
02:25:33,290 --> 02:25:34,010
What happened?

4931
02:25:35,070 --> 02:25:35,670
Wait.

4932
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:38,730
Are there more fire things than usual?

4933
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:39,610
Two or four.

4934
02:25:39,690 --> 02:25:40,850
I mean you can literally count.

4935
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:42,750
Was there always six?

4936
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:43,930
There's six of everything.

4937
02:25:44,130 --> 02:25:45,090
Yeah, I mean.

4938
02:25:45,410 --> 02:25:48,390
Was there always six and six six six?

4939
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:52,910
Oh my god.

4940
02:25:53,010 --> 02:25:54,350
That was so spooky.

4941
02:25:54,650 --> 02:25:55,230
Spooky.

4942
02:25:56,130 --> 02:25:57,710
Her stream is alive.

4943
02:25:58,110 --> 02:25:59,870
My stream is alive now.

4944
02:26:01,530 --> 02:26:03,490
I think there's nothing here.

4945
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:05,710
There's been like not a lot of anomalies for this one.

4946
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:06,470
Not for this one, no.

4947
02:26:06,770 --> 02:26:08,570
I mean it's like such an empty room.

4948
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:09,450
What are you gonna do?

4949
02:26:09,550 --> 02:26:12,830
I think this one's like harder to have anomalies.

4950
02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:13,590
I think so too.

4951
02:26:14,210 --> 02:26:14,970
I think we're fine.

4952
02:26:16,190 --> 02:26:16,630
Yeah.

4953
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:17,030
Alright.

4954
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:18,710
Oh, I can't punch you.

4955
02:26:19,350 --> 02:26:20,510
You took your quota.

4956
02:26:20,990 --> 02:26:21,790
What happened?

4957
02:26:22,230 --> 02:26:23,670
Why can't I punch all the time?

4958
02:26:24,130 --> 02:26:25,650
How come we can't have six brothers?

4959
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:26,670
I don't understand.

4960
02:26:28,130 --> 02:26:29,730
We can only have five brothers.

4961
02:26:29,890 --> 02:26:31,710
It goes up to four players.

4962
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:32,390
Yeah.

4963
02:26:34,170 --> 02:26:34,890
Where's our...

4964
02:26:34,890 --> 02:26:37,330
Where's brother four, five, and six?

4965
02:26:37,390 --> 02:26:38,630
We went in the wrong elevator.

4966
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:44,840
This was you.

4967
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:46,140
No, it wasn't!

4968
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:46,840
This was you.

4969
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:47,700
No, it wasn't you!

4970
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:48,300
Let's away!

4971
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:49,220
This was you.

4972
02:26:49,220 --> 02:26:49,560
This was you.

4973
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:50,460
No, I followed you.

4974
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:51,340
I followed you.

4975
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:52,320
You could have stopped me.

4976
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:52,400
It's okay.

4977
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:52,920
We can speedrun.

4978
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:54,000
We can speedrun.

4979
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:54,820
We can speedrun.

4980
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:55,680
We can speedrun.

4981
02:26:59,060 --> 02:26:59,420
Handprint.

4982
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:00,860
Oh no.

4983
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:02,320
Check if the thing appears.

4984
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:04,160
Wait, but what if there's new anomalies?

4985
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,240
What if there's new ones that we don't...

4986
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:08,280
What if there's new ones that we don't...

4987
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:08,560
Oh wait, no.

4988
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:09,080
This is zero.

4989
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:09,620
This is zero.

4990
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,340
Oh, this is zero.

4991
02:27:10,380 --> 02:27:10,600
You're right.

4992
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:10,940
You're right.

4993
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:11,900
No!

4994
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:19,360
No, this is Chat's fault.

4995
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:21,000
They should have told us.

4996
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:22,300
They should have told us.

4997
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:23,480
They should have said...

4998
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:25,760
They should have laughed at our jokes because we're just so funny.

4999
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:32,190
Okay.

5000
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:34,610
Okay.

5001
02:27:35,690 --> 02:27:36,090
Okay.

5002
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:36,330
Okay.

5003
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:39,570
Thank you, game.

5004
02:27:39,790 --> 02:27:40,410
Thank you, game.

5005
02:27:40,530 --> 02:27:41,170
Thank you.

5006
02:27:41,230 --> 02:27:41,630
Don't worry.

5007
02:27:41,710 --> 02:27:42,250
We can speedrun.

5008
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:43,150
What floor are we on?

5009
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:44,310
How far did we get to?

5010
02:27:44,650 --> 02:27:45,790
How far did we get to?

5011
02:27:46,110 --> 02:27:46,110
We got to 13.

5012
02:27:46,170 --> 02:27:47,570
We got to 13, man.

5013
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:48,990
We got to 13.

5014
02:27:50,090 --> 02:27:51,170
What the fuck?

5015
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:52,630
I dare you.

5016
02:27:52,650 --> 02:27:53,350
A triple dog dare you.

5017
02:27:53,370 --> 02:27:53,870
A quadruple dog dare you.

5018
02:27:53,870 --> 02:27:54,490
You know what?

5019
02:27:54,890 --> 02:27:55,970
I'm not afraid.

5020
02:27:59,390 --> 02:28:01,370
Oh my god.

5021
02:28:01,410 --> 02:28:01,930
I killed them.

5022
02:28:03,170 --> 02:28:04,310
You murdered them.

5023
02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:05,910
You didn't see anything.

5024
02:28:07,210 --> 02:28:09,330
You cleaned up the bodies really fast.

5025
02:28:10,210 --> 02:28:10,730
You cleaned up the bodies really fast.

5026
02:28:10,730 --> 02:28:11,130
Oh my god.

5027
02:28:11,290 --> 02:28:12,350
You didn't see anything.

5028
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:13,250
You killed them.

5029
02:28:13,490 --> 02:28:15,210
No, I did not, brother.

5030
02:28:15,470 --> 02:28:17,650
Remember, there's always been three brothers.

5031
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:18,650
Remember that.

5032
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:21,150
There's always been three brothers.

5033
02:28:21,370 --> 02:28:24,910
There's never been a fourth, fifth, or sixth brother.

5034
02:28:28,190 --> 02:28:29,230
There's never been a fourth, fifth, or sixth brother.

5035
02:28:30,490 --> 02:28:32,050
It's the mating ritual again.

5036
02:28:32,110 --> 02:28:33,170
Oh, it's the mating ritual.

5037
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:33,410
You're right.

5038
02:28:33,870 --> 02:28:34,910
Here they come.

5039
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:35,570
Here they come.

5040
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:38,210
This is why there's only three brothers.

5041
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:39,850
I'm an accessory to murder.

5042
02:28:40,170 --> 02:28:41,470
I'm an accessory to murder.

5043
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:43,950
They won't believe you.

5044
02:28:44,050 --> 02:28:45,770
Hey, but that was a new one, so that means...

5045
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:46,670
That was a new one, yeah.

5046
02:28:47,890 --> 02:28:48,330
Okay.

5047
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:50,470
We got this.

5048
02:28:53,090 --> 02:28:54,510
Speedrun, speedrun, speedrun.

5049
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:55,870
Speedrun, speedrun, speedrun.

5050
02:28:56,050 --> 02:28:57,750
We have to be careful of the head, though.

5051
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:58,530
Peeking out.

5052
02:29:00,030 --> 02:29:01,090
I'll look at it.

5053
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:01,770
I'm looking at it.

5054
02:29:02,410 --> 02:29:02,850
Okay.

5055
02:29:02,850 --> 02:29:04,030
I'm looking at it.

5056
02:29:04,050 --> 02:29:06,450
Look through the cracks right now while we check.

5057
02:29:06,450 --> 02:29:08,510
I'm looking through the cracks.

5058
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:09,290
I'm peeking.

5059
02:29:09,290 --> 02:29:10,170
I'm voyeuring.

5060
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:12,470
I don't see anything, actually.

5061
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:13,130
I don't see anything either.

5062
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:15,070
Brother is still being brother.

5063
02:29:16,590 --> 02:29:17,850
This is why he doesn't talk.

5064
02:29:21,310 --> 02:29:24,730
He saw some stuff he wasn't supposed to.

5065
02:29:25,070 --> 02:29:25,250
He saw some stuff.

5066
02:29:25,550 --> 02:29:27,410
The mating ritual.

5067
02:29:28,510 --> 02:29:29,070
Okay.

5068
02:29:29,130 --> 02:29:29,930
Check for handprint.

5069
02:29:29,930 --> 02:29:30,690
I already looked.

5070
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:31,370
I already looked.

5071
02:29:31,530 --> 02:29:32,170
We all looked.

5072
02:29:32,310 --> 02:29:33,130
Here we go.

5073
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:33,810
4-0-5.

5074
02:29:33,930 --> 02:29:34,930
4-0-5, baby.

5075
02:29:35,130 --> 02:29:36,390
4-0-5!

5076
02:29:36,730 --> 02:29:38,850
Give it up for 4-0-5!

5077
02:29:39,450 --> 02:29:39,930
Bing!

5078
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:40,690
Bing!

5079
02:29:41,230 --> 02:29:43,910
Alright, here we go.

5080
02:29:44,250 --> 02:29:45,210
Here we go.

5081
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:47,610
Let's see.

5082
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:49,550
Brother is still brother.

5083
02:29:51,510 --> 02:29:52,470
It's so loud.

5084
02:29:52,550 --> 02:29:53,650
It's so loud!

5085
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:55,970
It's so damn loud!

5086
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:59,310
I never expected...

5087
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:01,890
No one ever expects the blow dryers.

5088
02:30:01,950 --> 02:30:03,010
At least we got it out of the way.

5089
02:30:03,670 --> 02:30:04,610
Oh my god.

5090
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:06,410
Here we go.

5091
02:30:06,750 --> 02:30:07,330
We're okay.

5092
02:30:08,010 --> 02:30:08,450
We're okay.

5093
02:30:08,490 --> 02:30:08,930
We're okay.

5094
02:30:09,010 --> 02:30:10,230
We're almost back to 13.

5095
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:12,230
Brother...

5096
02:30:12,890 --> 02:30:15,770
Brother is not performing any miracles right now.

5097
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:16,450
I'm looking.

5098
02:30:16,630 --> 02:30:16,750
I'm checking.

5099
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:18,230
What?

5100
02:30:18,990 --> 02:30:19,410
What?

5101
02:30:19,970 --> 02:30:20,890
Check the doors.

5102
02:30:24,390 --> 02:30:24,870
Wow!

5103
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:26,130
What the fuck?

5104
02:30:26,170 --> 02:30:26,890
He closed the door!

5105
02:30:27,990 --> 02:30:28,470
Stop!

5106
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:29,810
Stop looking!

5107
02:30:29,930 --> 02:30:30,570
Stop looking at them!

5108
02:30:30,910 --> 02:30:31,550
Stop it!

5109
02:30:31,710 --> 02:30:32,630
Stop looking at them!

5110
02:30:32,650 --> 02:30:34,830
She lets you look, but I can't.

5111
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:39,810
Were you invited to something?

5112
02:30:40,410 --> 02:30:41,430
I think so.

5113
02:30:41,790 --> 02:30:42,450
I think so.

5114
02:30:42,550 --> 02:30:43,790
But that was also a new one.

5115
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:44,510
That was a new one.

5116
02:30:44,650 --> 02:30:46,190
I've never seen that one before.

5117
02:30:46,510 --> 02:30:49,570
That could have been 14, 15, and 16.

5118
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:50,090
Brother.

5119
02:30:50,710 --> 02:30:52,430
Brother is not performing miracles.

5120
02:30:52,750 --> 02:30:54,010
No peek-a-boo.

5121
02:30:54,390 --> 02:30:55,190
No peek-a-boo.

5122
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:55,950
No peek-a-boo.

5123
02:30:56,630 --> 02:30:58,470
We're missing one new anomaly.

5124
02:30:59,290 --> 02:31:00,390
I think so too.

5125
02:31:01,270 --> 02:31:01,750
Yeah.

5126
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:02,730
No hands.

5127
02:31:02,810 --> 02:31:04,110
We can see our faces.

5128
02:31:04,450 --> 02:31:05,950
There's no hands coming from the vents.

5129
02:31:06,530 --> 02:31:07,630
I think we're fine.

5130
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:08,790
No anomalies.

5131
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,590
Okay.

5132
02:31:09,630 --> 02:31:09,970
Cool.

5133
02:31:10,170 --> 02:31:10,430
Alright.

5134
02:31:10,490 --> 02:31:10,750
Nice.

5135
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:13,070
Alright.

5136
02:31:13,370 --> 02:31:13,850
See?

5137
02:31:13,970 --> 02:31:14,950
We're so good at this.

5138
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:15,550
Let's go.

5139
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:16,350
Let's go.

5140
02:31:16,430 --> 02:31:18,090
We could have been at 4500.

5141
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:19,890
Shut up.

5142
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:20,450
Shut up.

5143
02:31:20,590 --> 02:31:21,330
We'll be there.

5144
02:31:21,410 --> 02:31:21,850
We'll be there.

5145
02:31:21,850 --> 02:31:24,250
We could have been at 4500.

5146
02:31:24,250 --> 02:31:24,270
We'll be there.

5147
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:24,910
We'll be there.

5148
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:26,450
We'll be there.

5149
02:31:27,570 --> 02:31:28,610
We'll get there.

5150
02:31:29,810 --> 02:31:30,750
We'll get there.

5151
02:31:32,090 --> 02:31:32,570
Okay.

5152
02:31:32,710 --> 02:31:33,050
Alright.

5153
02:31:33,410 --> 02:31:33,890
Brother.

5154
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:35,830
Brother sitting down.

5155
02:31:36,250 --> 02:31:36,730
Faces.

5156
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:37,650
Handprint.

5157
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:38,170
Handprint.

5158
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:38,510
Handprint.

5159
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:38,910
Handprint.

5160
02:31:38,910 --> 02:31:39,370
Alright.

5161
02:31:39,370 --> 02:31:40,370
Back to the elevator.

5162
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:41,350
Back to the elevator.

5163
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,890
Back to the elevator.

5164
02:31:42,910 --> 02:31:43,390
Bro.

5165
02:31:44,470 --> 02:31:46,530
We got a retweet going on now.

5166
02:31:46,570 --> 02:31:46,850
I know.

5167
02:31:46,910 --> 02:31:47,530
We have a system.

5168
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:49,210
We're speedrunners.

5169
02:31:49,250 --> 02:31:50,390
We're speedrunners.

5170
02:31:50,410 --> 02:31:51,470
Speedrun.com.

5171
02:31:51,850 --> 02:31:52,570
Sign us up.

5172
02:31:53,070 --> 02:31:53,870
Maybe don't.

5173
02:31:55,910 --> 02:31:57,070
Why are we speedrunning?

5174
02:31:57,630 --> 02:31:58,430
Because we...

5175
02:31:59,330 --> 02:31:59,730
No.

5176
02:31:59,830 --> 02:31:59,930
No.

5177
02:31:59,950 --> 02:32:01,070
Because you...

5178
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:02,930
Chat messed up.

5179
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:03,610
Chat.

5180
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:05,310
Brother is brothering.

5181
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:06,290
Brother is brothering.

5182
02:32:06,290 --> 02:32:06,790
We have faces.

5183
02:32:08,170 --> 02:32:09,210
We have faces.

5184
02:32:09,310 --> 02:32:10,450
There's the peek-a-boo.

5185
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:10,990
Peek-a-boo.

5186
02:32:11,090 --> 02:32:11,330
Peek-a-boo.

5187
02:32:11,410 --> 02:32:11,670
Peek-a-boo.

5188
02:32:12,370 --> 02:32:12,770
Alright.

5189
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:15,730
This is the slowest speedrun.

5190
02:32:15,810 --> 02:32:16,570
What do you mean?

5191
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:20,230
I don't mean you.

5192
02:32:25,610 --> 02:32:27,190
What chat are we talking about?

5193
02:32:28,150 --> 02:32:28,950
What chat are we talking about?

5194
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:29,050
What chat are we talking about?

5195
02:32:29,810 --> 02:32:30,750
What are you trying to plot?

5196
02:32:31,050 --> 02:32:32,330
What are you trying to plot?

5197
02:32:32,470 --> 02:32:32,750
I don't know.

5198
02:32:32,750 --> 02:32:34,070
I think there's only two chats here.

5199
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:35,810
Brother is...

5200
02:32:35,810 --> 02:32:37,650
Brother comes after us.

5201
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:38,610
Brother does not just...

5202
02:32:38,610 --> 02:32:39,170
Brother runs.

5203
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:41,650
Brother walks.

5204
02:32:42,770 --> 02:32:43,570
A miracle.

5205
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:44,750
The second miracle.

5206
02:32:46,790 --> 02:32:48,070
What if he came to the door?

5207
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:49,150
What if he was just like...

5208
02:32:49,150 --> 02:32:50,230
He was trying to talk to us.

5209
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:50,910
He was trying to communicate.

5210
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:51,630
He was like, brothers.

5211
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:53,090
Brothers, look at me now.

5212
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:53,590
Brothers.

5213
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:55,010
This is the one time I'm sentient.

5214
02:32:56,030 --> 02:32:58,170
Brothers, I have something very important to tell you.

5215
02:32:58,970 --> 02:32:59,370
Brothers, I have something very important to tell you.

5216
02:32:59,370 --> 02:33:00,230
Oh, it's the footprints.

5217
02:33:00,650 --> 02:33:00,970
Footprints.

5218
02:33:01,010 --> 02:33:01,450
Oh, it's the foot.

5219
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:01,970
Alright.

5220
02:33:02,650 --> 02:33:05,170
This is the one time I can say whatever it is.

5221
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:06,950
I've been keeping it in this entire time.

5222
02:33:08,470 --> 02:33:09,210
Oh my god.

5223
02:33:09,230 --> 02:33:09,870
We're almost safe.

5224
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:10,350
Back to work.

5225
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:14,550
We're still missing one more anomaly that we haven't seen before.

5226
02:33:14,910 --> 02:33:15,830
We're still missing one more anomaly that we haven't seen before.

5227
02:33:15,850 --> 02:33:16,730
Because we got...

5228
02:33:18,130 --> 02:33:21,010
Because we were missing three and now we saw two of the new ones.

5229
02:33:21,310 --> 02:33:21,670
Yeah.

5230
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:23,430
We need the...

5231
02:33:23,430 --> 02:33:24,930
This one is going to be the faces.

5232
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:25,630
Nope.

5233
02:33:25,650 --> 02:33:25,970
Never mind.

5234
02:33:25,970 --> 02:33:26,230
Just kidding.

5235
02:33:26,390 --> 02:33:27,950
No urinals.

5236
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:30,090
I don't see anything.

5237
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:31,790
There's no hands coming out of the vents.

5238
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:33,890
Nothing.

5239
02:33:35,450 --> 02:33:37,150
At least they don't make us count these.

5240
02:33:37,210 --> 02:33:37,590
I know.

5241
02:33:38,890 --> 02:33:40,110
I'm not paying attention.

5242
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:42,290
I know it's all sixes, but I'm not paying attention.

5243
02:33:42,670 --> 02:33:43,290
Me neither.

5244
02:33:45,350 --> 02:33:45,710
Alright.

5245
02:33:46,730 --> 02:33:47,710
Four thirteen!

5246
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:51,510
Back where we started!

5247
02:33:52,670 --> 02:33:53,630
Yeah, you're right.

5248
02:33:54,750 --> 02:33:55,350
Ding!

5249
02:33:55,350 --> 02:33:55,950
Nice!

5250
02:33:56,450 --> 02:33:57,510
Nice, nice, nice.

5251
02:33:57,630 --> 02:33:58,790
Nice, nice, nice.

5252
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:01,090
What's this one?

5253
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,230
No faces.

5254
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:03,230
No faces.

5255
02:34:03,430 --> 02:34:05,670
No blood in the urinals.

5256
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:07,210
No hands coming out.

5257
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:09,630
There's nothing.

5258
02:34:10,130 --> 02:34:11,690
Another... no anomaly?

5259
02:34:12,290 --> 02:34:13,170
Two in a row?

5260
02:34:13,610 --> 02:34:14,550
Two in a row?

5261
02:34:14,690 --> 02:34:15,470
Two, four, six...

5262
02:34:16,730 --> 02:34:17,150
Come on!

5263
02:34:17,390 --> 02:34:19,510
You're getting a little lazy right now.

5264
02:34:20,390 --> 02:34:21,190
Come on!

5265
02:34:21,550 --> 02:34:22,830
What is this?

5266
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:24,490
We want an actual challenge.

5267
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:25,190
This way.

5268
02:34:25,290 --> 02:34:25,750
This way.

5269
02:34:26,770 --> 02:34:27,170
This way.

5270
02:34:32,330 --> 02:34:33,130
Four fourteen!

5271
02:34:34,010 --> 02:34:34,410
Yippee!

5272
02:34:34,670 --> 02:34:36,550
The last three has to be the anomalies ones.

5273
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:42,510
Because we're missing the faces, the hands coming out of the vents, and the blood in the urinals.

5274
02:34:42,590 --> 02:34:43,790
Yeah, we're missing those three.

5275
02:34:43,790 --> 02:34:45,650
So, easy peasy.

5276
02:34:45,830 --> 02:34:46,710
We got this, guys.

5277
02:34:47,570 --> 02:34:48,390
Alright, which one is this?

5278
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:48,730
Hands!

5279
02:34:49,710 --> 02:34:50,290
Hands, alright.

5280
02:34:51,330 --> 02:34:51,910
You know what?

5281
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:53,930
I bet you, you won't risk it.

5282
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:55,470
We stay in the elevator for the last three.

5283
02:34:57,750 --> 02:34:58,690
Stay in the elevator?

5284
02:34:58,790 --> 02:34:59,150
Oh, me?

5285
02:34:59,810 --> 02:35:01,710
No, we press the buttons.

5286
02:35:01,750 --> 02:35:02,730
We don't even have to look at it.

5287
02:35:02,750 --> 02:35:04,150
Because the last two has to be anomalies.

5288
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:05,110
You're a coward.

5289
02:35:06,170 --> 02:35:07,430
What do you mean I'm a coward?

5290
02:35:07,510 --> 02:35:08,910
I wanted to go into the room!

5291
02:35:09,410 --> 02:35:10,930
You know it's an anomaly!

5292
02:35:10,930 --> 02:35:12,090
But what if it's not?

5293
02:35:12,530 --> 02:35:13,630
What if it's not?

5294
02:35:16,490 --> 02:35:17,750
Blood in the urinal.

5295
02:35:18,330 --> 02:35:19,190
I knew it.

5296
02:35:19,270 --> 02:35:21,450
The last one has to be the mirrors.

5297
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:22,870
Okay, then you can check.

5298
02:35:24,050 --> 02:35:25,110
It's too risky!

5299
02:35:25,430 --> 02:35:26,510
It's too risky!

5300
02:35:27,030 --> 02:35:27,670
I'm going to do it.

5301
02:35:28,250 --> 02:35:29,250
How much do you want to bet?

5302
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:31,050
I will bet money.

5303
02:35:32,590 --> 02:35:34,770
I will bet on Akasupa.

5304
02:35:34,990 --> 02:35:36,110
I will bet on Akasupa.

5305
02:35:36,370 --> 02:35:37,930
You know I'm right.

5306
02:35:38,170 --> 02:35:39,450
You know I'm right.

5307
02:35:39,490 --> 02:35:40,430
You don't want to bet.

5308
02:35:40,930 --> 02:35:41,830
You know I'm right.

5309
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:43,450
You're wrong.

5310
02:35:45,170 --> 02:35:46,650
Why are you running back this way?

5311
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:49,710
You're wrong.

5312
02:35:50,010 --> 02:35:50,910
You're wrong.

5313
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:52,510
You're wrong.

5314
02:35:54,010 --> 02:35:55,910
That's why I'm smarty.

5315
02:35:56,510 --> 02:35:58,750
I'm going to die immediately on this one.

5316
02:35:58,790 --> 02:35:59,490
So that...

5317
02:35:59,490 --> 02:36:01,210
Where are we?

5318
02:36:01,230 --> 02:36:02,570
We're in a janitor's closet?

5319
02:36:03,970 --> 02:36:04,890
Oh my god.

5320
02:36:05,370 --> 02:36:07,890
Why is it so dark in there?

5321
02:36:07,890 --> 02:36:09,370
I don't know.

5322
02:36:09,430 --> 02:36:10,910
Oh no.

5323
02:36:11,170 --> 02:36:12,550
Oh no.

5324
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:14,050
We have to go downstairs.

5325
02:36:17,690 --> 02:36:20,950
I think we broke our ankles.

5326
02:36:21,410 --> 02:36:23,250
I think we broke our ankles.

5327
02:36:23,690 --> 02:36:24,250
I think we broke our ankles.

5328
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:25,670
Okay, maybe we don't push each other then.

5329
02:36:26,090 --> 02:36:28,130
Maybe we can't actually.

5330
02:36:28,170 --> 02:36:29,410
You can't run?

5331
02:36:29,810 --> 02:36:31,590
You can't even run?

5332
02:36:31,730 --> 02:36:33,270
I fucking ran.

5333
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:34,330
I broke my ankle.

5334
02:36:34,330 --> 02:36:35,170
There's something like humming.

5335
02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:39,650
I like ran and I broke my ankle.

5336
02:36:40,010 --> 02:36:40,550
I like ran and I broke my ankle.

5337
02:36:40,550 --> 02:36:40,990
What happened?

5338
02:36:41,070 --> 02:36:42,170
You are weak bone.

5339
02:36:42,370 --> 02:36:43,110
What happened to you?

5340
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:45,690
I was born with glass bones.

5341
02:36:47,290 --> 02:36:49,230
Are you even watching?

5342
02:36:49,350 --> 02:36:53,290
I was born with glass bones.

5343
02:36:53,290 --> 02:36:54,290
There's a girl whispering.

5344
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:55,670
She's humming.

5345
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:58,390
Every breath I take is pain.

5346
02:36:58,730 --> 02:36:59,830
Shut up.

5347
02:36:59,870 --> 02:37:01,830
You weak willed woman.

5348
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:03,330
Oh my god.

5349
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:04,410
I'm so close.

5350
02:37:04,610 --> 02:37:06,210
Do I just walk?

5351
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:07,170
Oh my god.

5352
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:07,910
Wait, there's a face there.

5353
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:09,510
There's a face?

5354
02:37:09,570 --> 02:37:09,890
Where?

5355
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:11,450
Look at it.

5356
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:14,810
It would be so funny if you look at it again.

5357
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:16,430
Oh, okay.

5358
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:17,530
I made it.

5359
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:18,370
There's no face, you liar.

5360
02:37:18,910 --> 02:37:19,650
Yes, there is.

5361
02:37:20,430 --> 02:37:23,230
Why am I the only one that survives these?

5362
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:25,270
Doki, you...

5363
02:37:25,270 --> 02:37:27,950
I'm sorry, my bones were made of glass.

5364
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:32,250
Oh, you're gonna fucking bring up my medical history.

5365
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:36,510
My brother has been demoted to being a janitor.

5366
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:37,690
He's a janitor.

5367
02:37:37,710 --> 02:37:40,050
Okay, this is always in here.

5368
02:37:40,110 --> 02:37:40,910
This little head bag.

5369
02:37:41,190 --> 02:37:42,650
They're throwing away body parts.

5370
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:45,230
Oh yeah, this little head bag.

5371
02:37:45,530 --> 02:37:47,330
Why are they throwing away body parts?

5372
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:50,470
There's so many caution wets.

5373
02:37:50,470 --> 02:37:50,970
There's six brooms.

5374
02:37:51,390 --> 02:37:52,370
Six brooms.

5375
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:54,930
There's six trash cans.

5376
02:37:55,350 --> 02:37:56,510
But there's only five sinks.

5377
02:37:57,550 --> 02:37:59,850
Oh, I feel like that's gonna be an anomaly.

5378
02:37:59,970 --> 02:38:01,910
They're just gonna bring a sixth sink out of nowhere.

5379
02:38:02,150 --> 02:38:04,570
And there's five trash cans.

5380
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:06,610
There's five trash cans?

5381
02:38:07,170 --> 02:38:08,970
Oh, cause this is like floor 500.

5382
02:38:09,330 --> 02:38:10,270
We're so close.

5383
02:38:10,530 --> 02:38:15,290
We have 266 floors to go.

5384
02:38:15,950 --> 02:38:18,030
We're almost at the finish line.

5385
02:38:18,930 --> 02:38:19,410
We're almost at the finish line.

5386
02:38:19,410 --> 02:38:19,530
We're almost at the finish line.

5387
02:38:20,070 --> 02:38:22,870
I did not expect this game to be like three hours long.

5388
02:38:23,470 --> 02:38:30,550
Well, you know, if some chatters wouldn't you know, give us the wrong information.

5389
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:31,770
Oh, you're so right.

5390
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:36,870
If some chatters backseated us better.

5391
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:42,670
Oh god, that actually That actually got me.

5392
02:38:42,790 --> 02:38:44,270
That actually got me.

5393
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:46,590
That got me too.

5394
02:38:46,930 --> 02:38:49,310
Wait, that's the anomaly, right?

5395
02:38:49,470 --> 02:38:50,510
It started us over.

5396
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:51,890
No, it's 501.

5397
02:38:52,330 --> 02:38:53,470
That's where we were at.

5398
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:54,850
Yeah, so we go up.

5399
02:38:54,950 --> 02:38:55,790
That was the anomaly.

5400
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:56,630
Oh, okay, then go up.

5401
02:38:56,670 --> 02:38:56,910
Yeah, yeah.

5402
02:38:57,010 --> 02:38:58,250
Yeah, it had to be.

5403
02:38:59,410 --> 02:39:00,410
Kinda got me.

5404
02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:03,590
I was like, I just got a new PC last week.

5405
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:04,310
What do you mean?

5406
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:07,610
What do you mean?

5407
02:39:08,610 --> 02:39:10,030
And I saw 666.

5408
02:39:11,670 --> 02:39:13,210
Yeah, you guys, it's the dragoons.

5409
02:39:13,210 --> 02:39:13,690
It's not you.

5410
02:39:13,870 --> 02:39:14,270
Don't worry.

5411
02:39:14,330 --> 02:39:15,410
Yeah, you guys, it's the wisps.

5412
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:15,830
Don't worry.

5413
02:39:16,930 --> 02:39:18,730
You know, it's always the wisps.

5414
02:39:19,350 --> 02:39:20,570
Go into the rooms.

5415
02:39:21,030 --> 02:39:22,570
Good, good, good.

5416
02:39:23,270 --> 02:39:24,390
It's both of us.

5417
02:39:24,530 --> 02:39:24,970
Wait.

5418
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:27,650
Brother, brother, help us, brother.

5419
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:30,090
Brother, brother, brother protect us, brother.

5420
02:39:30,290 --> 02:39:31,010
Brother, brother, brother.

5421
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:32,610
Go big, go.

5422
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:35,470
It's Johnny!

5423
02:39:37,710 --> 02:39:39,110
Is he gonna break it down?

5424
02:39:39,250 --> 02:39:40,310
It's Johnny.

5425
02:39:52,070 --> 02:39:53,270
Okay, that was good.

5426
02:39:53,350 --> 02:39:54,150
It's Johnny.

5427
02:39:58,010 --> 02:39:59,790
Yo, that was so good.

5428
02:39:59,950 --> 02:40:00,430
That was good.

5429
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:00,890
I like that.

5430
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:03,590
It's the perfectly cut rectangle in the door.

5431
02:40:08,290 --> 02:40:09,010
Blender rectangle.

5432
02:40:12,450 --> 02:40:12,810
Delete.

5433
02:40:14,330 --> 02:40:15,470
Let's go, let's go.

5434
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:17,690
I wonder what it would have looked like on the outside.

5435
02:40:19,090 --> 02:40:19,970
I know, right?

5436
02:40:20,150 --> 02:40:21,090
I am pretty curious.

5437
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:22,910
That was a good one.

5438
02:40:22,970 --> 02:40:23,630
That was pretty good.

5439
02:40:23,710 --> 02:40:24,290
That was a good one.

5440
02:40:24,290 --> 02:40:24,750
You know what, Des?

5441
02:40:24,770 --> 02:40:25,290
You got that.

5442
02:40:25,570 --> 02:40:25,890
You got that.

5443
02:40:26,630 --> 02:40:28,070
You can have that one.

5444
02:40:28,310 --> 02:40:29,650
I don't think there's anything here.

5445
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:30,870
I don't see any anomalies.

5446
02:40:31,770 --> 02:40:33,690
The bags all have one.

5447
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:36,870
Check the signs if they say any other 666.

5448
02:40:38,310 --> 02:40:40,710
I feel like every floor has a 666 somewhere.

5449
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:41,790
I feel like every floor has a 666 somewhere.

5450
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:43,250
Sometimes, someplace, somewhere.

5451
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:43,890
Somewhere.

5452
02:40:44,690 --> 02:40:45,170
666.

5453
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:47,810
Have you been counting all of these?

5454
02:40:47,870 --> 02:40:48,770
They're all five, right?

5455
02:40:48,890 --> 02:40:49,570
They're all five.

5456
02:40:49,610 --> 02:40:50,630
We're on the fifth floor.

5457
02:40:50,830 --> 02:40:52,290
The 500th floor.

5458
02:40:52,290 --> 02:40:53,630
The dev is so funny.

5459
02:40:57,030 --> 02:40:57,950
Alright, here we go.

5460
02:40:57,950 --> 02:40:59,510
Johnny goes in the square hole.

5461
02:41:00,530 --> 02:41:04,110
The Johnny goes in the square hole.

5462
02:41:04,810 --> 02:41:05,850
The Johnny goes in the square hole.

5463
02:41:06,470 --> 02:41:07,550
Go on in.

5464
02:41:08,110 --> 02:41:09,530
There's gotta be something in here.

5465
02:41:10,810 --> 02:41:11,370
Caution.

5466
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:15,470
Nothing.

5467
02:41:16,130 --> 02:41:17,070
Nothing in the bag.

5468
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:20,790
There's no 6s anywhere.

5469
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:23,390
I feel like the 6s would be in the trash can.

5470
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:24,090
I feel like the 6s would be in the trash can.

5471
02:41:24,090 --> 02:41:25,630
Yeah, at the bottom of the trash can.

5472
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:28,950
I don't see any body parts coming out.

5473
02:41:29,050 --> 02:41:29,770
I think we're good.

5474
02:41:29,910 --> 02:41:31,090
I'm going on the other side.

5475
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:32,070
I think we're good.

5476
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:32,070
I'm going on the other side.

5477
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:33,730
Okay, brother.

5478
02:41:34,050 --> 02:41:34,430
We're good.

5479
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:35,790
Goodbye, brother.

5480
02:41:36,090 --> 02:41:36,890
Where are you?

5481
02:41:37,170 --> 02:41:38,410
I was just double checking.

5482
02:41:39,510 --> 02:41:41,730
You never trust me.

5483
02:41:41,950 --> 02:41:43,150
I'm just checking too.

5484
02:41:43,150 --> 02:41:44,810
Even though I was right.

5485
02:41:45,410 --> 02:41:48,030
Okay, if we go to 500, I'm just saying.

5486
02:41:48,570 --> 02:41:50,590
Okay, if we go to 500, I'm just saying.

5487
02:41:50,590 --> 02:41:51,410
These were anomalies.

5488
02:41:51,430 --> 02:41:53,050
And you didn't trust me.

5489
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:53,970
You're like, no.

5490
02:41:54,850 --> 02:41:58,410
You wouldn't have put real money into it.

5491
02:41:58,430 --> 02:41:59,450
Because you knew I was right.

5492
02:41:59,610 --> 02:42:01,570
You knew I was right.

5493
02:42:01,570 --> 02:42:03,090
I was just being cautious.

5494
02:42:03,390 --> 02:42:05,890
You know your head bobbles up and down when you run.

5495
02:42:07,150 --> 02:42:08,570
Like actual running?

5496
02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:11,210
Wait, something seems different.

5497
02:42:12,210 --> 02:42:12,770
This?

5498
02:42:13,230 --> 02:42:15,930
No, that's way too many.

5499
02:42:16,350 --> 02:42:16,810
Plugs, right?

5500
02:42:17,150 --> 02:42:19,330
I think that's way too many.

5501
02:42:19,330 --> 02:42:20,150
Oh, there's way too many.

5502
02:42:21,850 --> 02:42:23,490
There's six of everything.

5503
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:24,010
There's six of everything suddenly.

5504
02:42:24,510 --> 02:42:26,650
Oh my god, we returned to port.

5505
02:42:27,310 --> 02:42:28,490
Oh my god, you're right.

5506
02:42:28,750 --> 02:42:29,690
There's six of everything.

5507
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:31,410
There's six of everything.

5508
02:42:32,130 --> 02:42:34,850
I like how you're like, look at the plugs.

5509
02:42:35,050 --> 02:42:35,610
I'm like...

5510
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:37,010
Look at everything else.

5511
02:42:42,210 --> 02:42:43,250
Very prepared.

5512
02:42:43,390 --> 02:42:45,630
You focused on the fucking plugs.

5513
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:48,430
I mean, it's the first thing I saw.

5514
02:42:48,610 --> 02:42:49,410
I don't know.

5515
02:42:50,590 --> 02:42:50,830
There's so many plugs.

5516
02:42:51,270 --> 02:42:53,230
Not the giant red fire hydrant.

5517
02:42:53,230 --> 02:42:54,830
There's just so many plugs.

5518
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:57,590
Look, they were covering the wall was the first thing I saw.

5519
02:42:57,690 --> 02:42:58,510
Oh, there's a baby.

5520
02:42:59,230 --> 02:43:00,250
Oh, there is a baby.

5521
02:43:01,170 --> 02:43:02,210
I can't move.

5522
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:03,910
I'm dead.

5523
02:43:04,450 --> 02:43:05,710
The baby killed you.

5524
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:07,670
I'm spectating.

5525
02:43:09,250 --> 02:43:10,910
The baby killed me.

5526
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:12,890
The baby killed me.

5527
02:43:12,970 --> 02:43:13,710
Babies are dangerous.

5528
02:43:16,250 --> 02:43:17,510
Don't look at the baby.

5529
02:43:17,510 --> 02:43:19,310
Don't look at the baby.

5530
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:20,510
Don't look at the baby.

5531
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:23,290
And you were judging me when I killed those two girls.

5532
02:43:23,550 --> 02:43:24,870
The baby killed me.

5533
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:25,850
It should have killed you.

5534
02:43:26,370 --> 02:43:28,190
I was protecting you, brother.

5535
02:43:28,490 --> 02:43:30,090
I was protecting you, brother.

5536
02:43:30,090 --> 02:43:31,210
Brother is about to explode.

5537
02:43:32,670 --> 02:43:33,630
There's a TNT.

5538
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:36,510
There he

5539
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:42,830
goes.

5540
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:45,270
Goodbye, brother.

5541
02:43:46,770 --> 02:43:48,590
He was a brother to me.

5542
02:43:53,450 --> 02:43:54,490
Brother was literally...

5543
02:43:54,490 --> 02:43:57,270
You know that meme of the guy sitting and he's like super bright.

5544
02:43:57,470 --> 02:43:58,130
That's what he...

5545
02:43:58,130 --> 02:43:59,850
Like he's sitting in the little restaurant.

5546
02:44:01,210 --> 02:44:02,010
Come inside.

5547
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:03,270
What is wrong with you?

5548
02:44:03,470 --> 02:44:04,250
Wait, I was.

5549
02:44:04,290 --> 02:44:06,450
I was waiting for you to be inside first.

5550
02:44:06,490 --> 02:44:07,450
I was already inside.

5551
02:44:07,970 --> 02:44:08,570
No, you were not.

5552
02:44:08,630 --> 02:44:09,370
No, no, no.

5553
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:11,830
Check my VOD.

5554
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:15,150
VOD review time.

5555
02:44:16,590 --> 02:44:17,390
Time stampers.

5556
02:44:18,390 --> 02:44:19,850
I don't think there's anomalies here.

5557
02:44:20,770 --> 02:44:21,730
I don't think so either.

5558
02:44:21,730 --> 02:44:21,950
I'm pretty sure.

5559
02:44:23,290 --> 02:44:23,770
Let's go.

5560
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:25,410
Wait, only four mobs?

5561
02:44:25,570 --> 02:44:27,370
I don't think the chat is fucking with us.

5562
02:44:28,130 --> 02:44:28,570
No.

5563
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:31,850
No.

5564
02:44:32,850 --> 02:44:33,290
509.

5565
02:44:35,250 --> 02:44:35,690
509.

5566
02:44:37,470 --> 02:44:37,910
Gaslighting.

5567
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:39,310
That was way too detailed.

5568
02:44:40,690 --> 02:44:42,970
Because a real chatter would be like...

5569
02:44:42,970 --> 02:44:44,950
The head is moved.

5570
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:46,750
You sure?

5571
02:44:47,390 --> 02:44:47,810
Yeah.

5572
02:44:48,310 --> 02:44:49,670
It's not moving now.

5573
02:44:49,850 --> 02:44:50,970
No, like they're in different positions.

5574
02:44:52,470 --> 02:44:52,990
Oh.

5575
02:44:52,990 --> 02:44:54,190
Are you sure?

5576
02:44:54,430 --> 02:44:54,690
Yep.

5577
02:44:55,250 --> 02:44:56,070
I'm 100%.

5578
02:44:56,070 --> 02:44:56,350
Oh, you're right.

5579
02:44:56,370 --> 02:44:57,890
It's moved up closer.

5580
02:44:57,990 --> 02:44:58,490
You're right.

5581
02:44:58,530 --> 02:44:58,930
I see it.

5582
02:44:59,370 --> 02:45:01,030
Easy peasy.

5583
02:45:01,470 --> 02:45:02,330
I'm so good at this game.

5584
02:45:02,410 --> 02:45:03,410
I'm so good.

5585
02:45:03,490 --> 02:45:06,370
I like find everything so quickly before Doki.

5586
02:45:07,010 --> 02:45:07,970
I'm sure.

5587
02:45:08,890 --> 02:45:09,710
Yeah, yeah.

5588
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:11,610
Like the six plugs that you saw too.

5589
02:45:12,050 --> 02:45:14,190
There were actually six plugs?

5590
02:45:15,310 --> 02:45:17,370
I don't know why that's what you're so focused on.

5591
02:45:20,410 --> 02:45:21,430
That's a lot of...

5592
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:22,670
That was not six plugs.

5593
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:23,870
How do we get out?

5594
02:45:24,010 --> 02:45:24,810
How do we get out?

5595
02:45:24,890 --> 02:45:25,710
Oh god, the collision.

5596
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:28,250
I can't get out.

5597
02:45:28,510 --> 02:45:30,730
I can't get out.

5598
02:45:32,090 --> 02:45:33,150
I can't get out.

5599
02:45:33,810 --> 02:45:35,450
I'm trying to clip through the wall.

5600
02:45:36,050 --> 02:45:36,790
I can't.

5601
02:45:36,910 --> 02:45:37,590
Push me.

5602
02:45:38,370 --> 02:45:40,970
No, you're not doing anything.

5603
02:45:41,650 --> 02:45:42,750
See, what do you mean?

5604
02:45:43,370 --> 02:45:44,570
See, this is why we...

5605
02:45:44,570 --> 02:45:45,090
Oh, I got out.

5606
02:45:45,210 --> 02:45:45,810
I got out.

5607
02:45:45,870 --> 02:45:46,250
I got out.

5608
02:45:46,310 --> 02:45:46,630
Come on.

5609
02:45:46,650 --> 02:45:47,130
Come on.

5610
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:48,150
You need...

5611
02:45:48,150 --> 02:45:49,410
Oh, it disappeared.

5612
02:45:49,530 --> 02:45:49,730
Okay.

5613
02:45:50,790 --> 02:45:52,730
Wow, you didn't even try.

5614
02:45:55,690 --> 02:45:58,090
See, this is why one of...

5615
02:45:58,090 --> 02:45:59,870
Only one of us needed to go inside.

5616
02:45:59,870 --> 02:46:00,810
Oh my god.

5617
02:46:02,970 --> 02:46:04,910
If it was just one of us...

5618
02:46:04,910 --> 02:46:07,190
I still... You still would have needed me.

5619
02:46:07,330 --> 02:46:07,750
No, no.

5620
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:08,930
Okay, you can go then this time.

5621
02:46:09,130 --> 02:46:10,870
I'm drinking my tea.

5622
02:46:10,910 --> 02:46:11,230
Hold on.

5623
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:13,010
Okay, you're drinking your tea.

5624
02:46:13,090 --> 02:46:13,530
I see.

5625
02:46:14,130 --> 02:46:15,950
I don't think there's anything here.

5626
02:46:18,930 --> 02:46:21,070
What are you laughing at?

5627
02:46:21,510 --> 02:46:22,550
I'm serious.

5628
02:46:22,690 --> 02:46:23,870
There's nothing here.

5629
02:46:23,870 --> 02:46:26,910
It's because you walk in for two seconds and you're like, nothing here.

5630
02:46:27,290 --> 02:46:29,590
Because I have good memory.

5631
02:46:29,770 --> 02:46:30,850
I'm like somebody.

5632
02:46:31,730 --> 02:46:33,130
Who has got... Okay.

5633
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:35,250
I actually need chat to...

5634
02:46:35,250 --> 02:46:39,410
to keep track of who has gotten the most things in this game.

5635
02:46:39,730 --> 02:46:40,430
I swear.

5636
02:46:40,530 --> 02:46:41,650
Face in the mirror.

5637
02:46:41,790 --> 02:46:42,070
Yeah, don't say me.

5638
02:46:42,330 --> 02:46:43,390
Wait, was there a mirror?

5639
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:43,770
There's no mirror in that game.

5640
02:46:43,770 --> 02:46:44,830
There's no mirror in there.

5641
02:46:46,390 --> 02:46:47,710
I got gas lit.

5642
02:46:49,130 --> 02:46:50,590
I got gas lit.

5643
02:46:50,730 --> 02:46:51,990
You know when they're lying?

5644
02:46:52,210 --> 02:46:54,470
When they get extra detailed.

5645
02:46:54,750 --> 02:46:58,330
Because usually when they think they see an anomaly, they'll be like, mirror.

5646
02:46:58,670 --> 02:47:00,630
But then they say face in the mirror.

5647
02:47:01,650 --> 02:47:03,630
I got one guide for real.

5648
02:47:04,610 --> 02:47:06,210
You got one guide.

5649
02:47:06,690 --> 02:47:06,810
Yeah.

5650
02:47:07,230 --> 02:47:08,170
5, 12.

5651
02:47:10,350 --> 02:47:11,570
Alright, here we go.

5652
02:47:13,750 --> 02:47:14,690
I hope it's...

5653
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:18,790
Guys, there's no way Doki would have gotten through this game without me.

5654
02:47:18,890 --> 02:47:19,810
I was...

5655
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:23,970
I was so good at exit 8.

5656
02:47:24,210 --> 02:47:24,690
Okay.

5657
02:47:25,370 --> 02:47:26,630
That's not exit 8.

5658
02:47:27,250 --> 02:47:29,510
This is literally exit 8 but multiplayer.

5659
02:47:29,950 --> 02:47:31,450
So I did that solo.

5660
02:47:31,930 --> 02:47:32,890
It's like a different game.

5661
02:47:33,530 --> 02:47:35,290
This is literally exit...

5662
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:36,050
Oh, anomaly.

5663
02:47:36,310 --> 02:47:37,870
See, I found it before you.

5664
02:47:38,010 --> 02:47:38,250
Wow.

5665
02:47:38,570 --> 02:47:40,050
Look at that.

5666
02:47:41,570 --> 02:47:42,150
I didn't even see it.

5667
02:47:42,190 --> 02:47:43,350
If I said nothing...

5668
02:47:43,350 --> 02:47:44,990
That was actually really good.

5669
02:47:46,190 --> 02:47:47,270
I'll give you that one.

5670
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:48,450
You don't have to press the button though.

5671
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:50,150
Which means I found it.

5672
02:47:50,190 --> 02:47:51,410
If I press the button, that means I found it.

5673
02:47:51,730 --> 02:47:53,510
What are these new rules?

5674
02:47:56,050 --> 02:47:58,990
She's definitely in kindergarten when they invent new rules.

5675
02:47:59,470 --> 02:47:59,870
Yeah,

5676
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:06,150
you were blocking my view actually.

5677
02:48:06,310 --> 02:48:09,950
So I just couldn't see it because your big head was in the way.

5678
02:48:10,910 --> 02:48:11,490
You know.

5679
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:13,870
I don't think there's anything here.

5680
02:48:13,910 --> 02:48:15,210
See, I don't think so either.

5681
02:48:15,350 --> 02:48:15,810
No anomaly.

5682
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:18,690
No anomaly?

5683
02:48:19,230 --> 02:48:20,410
You don't believe me?

5684
02:48:20,630 --> 02:48:21,290
I'm just checking.

5685
02:48:21,710 --> 02:48:22,830
You don't believe me?

5686
02:48:22,910 --> 02:48:24,670
Oh, someone doesn't believe me.

5687
02:48:26,350 --> 02:48:27,130
Get in there.

5688
02:48:27,650 --> 02:48:28,630
Oh, you press the button?

5689
02:48:28,790 --> 02:48:29,050
Okay.

5690
02:48:29,890 --> 02:48:30,330
Yeah.

5691
02:48:30,390 --> 02:48:32,090
This is your choice for no anomaly.

5692
02:48:32,090 --> 02:48:32,170
No anomaly.

5693
02:48:36,130 --> 02:48:37,250
Five points.

5694
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:43,730
You said it first.

5695
02:48:43,870 --> 02:48:45,370
You said it first.

5696
02:48:46,030 --> 02:48:47,570
You said it first.

5697
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:48,990
You said it first.

5698
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:50,450
You said it first.

5699
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:52,270
Remember your rule.

5700
02:48:52,430 --> 02:48:54,770
Remember your rule.

5701
02:48:55,110 --> 02:48:56,150
Your fucking rule.

5702
02:48:56,450 --> 02:49:00,230
It means that you found the anomaly.

5703
02:49:00,310 --> 02:49:01,970
But if there was no anomaly...

5704
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:07,220
I don't think there's anything here.

5705
02:49:08,180 --> 02:49:09,700
Do you know why we messed up?

5706
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:11,240
We went to the wrong elevator.

5707
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:19,320
We went to the orange light elevator.

5708
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:22,480
No, we didn't.

5709
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:24,060
No, we went to the other one, right?

5710
02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:32,540
That's what I'm telling you.

5711
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:35,120
And the rules are too confusing for this game.

5712
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,400
Ha ha ha.

5713
02:49:36,740 --> 02:49:38,360
The orange light...

5714
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:38,840
It's too bright.

5715
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:39,660
It needs to be more obvious.

5716
02:49:39,960 --> 02:49:43,200
It's too bright.

5717
02:49:45,280 --> 02:49:47,540
I'm telling you.

5718
02:49:48,460 --> 02:49:53,180
How much more obvious do they need to be...

5719
02:49:53,180 --> 02:49:55,820
The orange light needs to be very bright.

5720
02:49:55,820 --> 02:49:56,960
like so bright.

5721
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:58,900
Ha ha ha.

5722
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:01,380
It needs to be on fire.

5723
02:50:01,460 --> 02:50:02,340
Oh, I know this.

5724
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:06,060
They need signs, they need signs where it just has like big, like a 15 font text.

5725
02:50:06,060 --> 02:50:07,740
It says you came here.

5726
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:09,060
Impact font.

5727
02:50:10,600 --> 02:50:11,560
Anomaly here.

5728
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:13,400
No anomaly here.

5729
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,300
Oh, it's the bag heads, it's the bag heads.

5730
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:16,760
Okay.

5731
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:23,060
I found it, I found it, I found it.

5732
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:31,780
The one you fucked up, it was you who fucked up.

5733
02:50:31,780 --> 02:50:32,460
Not me.

5734
02:50:34,420 --> 02:50:37,520
Oh yeah, someone should stay outside for Johnny, you're right.

5735
02:50:37,980 --> 02:50:39,300
Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.

5736
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:41,400
Alright, I'll be outside.

5737
02:50:41,700 --> 02:50:42,820
I wanna see Johnny.

5738
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:45,120
Oh, rock, paper, scissors.

5739
02:50:45,580 --> 02:50:46,500
Rock, paper, scissors.

5740
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:50,400
I think there's no anomaly here.

5741
02:50:50,580 --> 02:50:51,260
But you can check.

5742
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:53,880
Don't, don't go that way, don't go that way.

5743
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:59,260
I was just testing you to see if it's like three in a row.

5744
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:03,780
I can't believe we got...

5745
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:04,920
We were so close.

5746
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:06,500
We were at 514.

5747
02:51:08,020 --> 02:51:09,540
It's just this one.

5748
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:11,680
Oh my god.

5749
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:13,820
Oh my god.

5750
02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:17,100
This is why this game is gonna take us three plus hours.

5751
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:18,420
This is why.

5752
02:51:21,530 --> 02:51:22,460
I don't think there's an anomaly.

5753
02:51:22,480 --> 02:51:24,360
Johnny, Johnny, yes papa.

5754
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:25,820
Johnny, Johnny, yes papa.

5755
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:30,300
Well, you gotta wait for me.

5756
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:32,400
No, I was able to get out.

5757
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:33,040
You can too.

5758
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:33,940
Come on.

5759
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:34,740
How?

5760
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:36,040
Push the boxes.

5761
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:38,500
Go outside and push the boxes inwards.

5762
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:40,100
I pushed them outwards.

5763
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:40,980
You can do it too.

5764
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:42,280
Come on, just use your legs.

5765
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:44,120
What do you mean I'm using...

5766
02:51:44,120 --> 02:51:44,640
I'm too tall.

5767
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:46,880
I'm sorry for being six foot seven.

5768
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:51,700
Says on my Tinder profile, six foot seven.

5769
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:55,600
Well, I'm gonna wait in the elevator for your lazy ass.

5770
02:51:55,780 --> 02:51:56,500
Oh my god.

5771
02:51:56,540 --> 02:51:57,140
Okay, it's gone.

5772
02:51:58,840 --> 02:51:59,800
Alright, here I am.

5773
02:51:59,800 --> 02:52:00,500
Oh my god.

5774
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:02,700
I'm getting there.

5775
02:52:03,220 --> 02:52:03,740
Come on.

5776
02:52:03,820 --> 02:52:04,660
Oh my god.

5777
02:52:04,660 --> 02:52:07,740
I'm going as fast as my six foot seven legs start taking me.

5778
02:52:07,740 --> 02:52:09,200
You have really short legs.

5779
02:52:09,280 --> 02:52:10,880
You have the widest torso in history.

5780
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:14,280
Three.

5781
02:52:14,840 --> 02:52:15,360
Five.

5782
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:16,060
Oh, fuck.

5783
02:52:17,360 --> 02:52:18,600
Eight more to go.

5784
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:22,640
Why is it always on 13 that we mess up?

5785
02:52:22,820 --> 02:52:23,480
I know.

5786
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:24,640
I think we get too comfortable.

5787
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:26,300
I mean, 13 is an unlucky number.

5788
02:52:26,780 --> 02:52:27,480
Oh, brother.

5789
02:52:27,620 --> 02:52:28,280
It's brother.

5790
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:29,200
It's a TNT brother.

5791
02:52:29,480 --> 02:52:30,440
It's a TNT brother.

5792
02:52:30,500 --> 02:52:30,600
Brother.

5793
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:30,620
Brother.

5794
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:31,620
Go, go, go, go.

5795
02:52:31,660 --> 02:52:32,040
Brother.

5796
02:52:33,640 --> 02:52:34,380
Please, brother.

5797
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:35,940
Think of your children.

5798
02:52:39,020 --> 02:52:39,460
Oh.

5799
02:52:40,780 --> 02:52:41,740
Alright, here we go.

5800
02:52:42,300 --> 02:52:43,600
Who wants a quick elevator?

5801
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:44,680
He's a creeper.

5802
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:45,580
Yeah, he's a creeper.

5803
02:52:46,100 --> 02:52:46,540
Alright.

5804
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:48,460
Don't call our brother a creep.

5805
02:52:48,540 --> 02:52:49,420
What's wrong with you?

5806
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:49,980
Oh my god.

5807
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:51,040
What are you talking about?

5808
02:52:51,320 --> 02:52:52,280
He still has children.

5809
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:54,620
That doesn't make him a creep at all.

5810
02:52:55,140 --> 02:52:56,300
That makes it...

5811
02:52:57,100 --> 02:52:58,100
Oh my god.

5812
02:52:58,100 --> 02:52:58,260
Oh my god.

5813
02:52:58,280 --> 02:52:58,560
Alright.

5814
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:00,000
I don't think there's any anomaly here.

5815
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:02,220
Oh, I don't think so either.

5816
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,220
Unless there's a new one.

5817
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:05,320
There's no smileys.

5818
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:05,820
Oh, that's true.

5819
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:07,400
We didn't think of new ones.

5820
02:53:07,660 --> 02:53:07,900
Yeah.

5821
02:53:07,900 --> 02:53:08,100
Brother space.

5822
02:53:08,100 --> 02:53:09,620
I think in general it doesn't.

5823
02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:10,600
There's no anomalies.

5824
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:11,260
Yeah, I think we're good.

5825
02:53:11,540 --> 02:53:12,600
I need sixes on the...

5826
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:13,020
Wait, wait, wait.

5827
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:13,640
Anomaly.

5828
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:14,280
Oh, anomaly.

5829
02:53:14,300 --> 02:53:14,740
You're right.

5830
02:53:14,840 --> 02:53:15,720
The six, six, six.

5831
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:16,780
I knew it.

5832
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:18,160
I knew the six would come back.

5833
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:19,360
I knew it.

5834
02:53:19,400 --> 02:53:19,540
See?

5835
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:26,580
Guys, remember the competition that Mint proposed where whoever catches the most anomalies wins?

5836
02:53:26,580 --> 02:53:26,600
What?

5837
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:27,960
What competition?

5838
02:53:28,140 --> 02:53:29,960
I just said who has the most.

5839
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:30,740
Who?

5840
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:35,340
This competition that Mint really wanted to do where she was like, oh, guys, time's up.

5841
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:38,160
Every time, like, whoever picks the anomalies.

5842
02:53:38,780 --> 02:53:39,260
Okay.

5843
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:39,380
Okay.

5844
02:53:39,380 --> 02:53:41,340
But I'm still winning.

5845
02:53:42,680 --> 02:53:44,020
Doki got, like, three.

5846
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:46,080
In your dreams, I guess.

5847
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:49,180
I like how you, like, don't even walk inside.

5848
02:53:49,660 --> 02:53:51,300
No, because we wanted to see Johnny.

5849
02:53:51,620 --> 02:53:52,180
Oh, yeah.

5850
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:52,820
Remember?

5851
02:53:53,280 --> 02:53:53,840
We're trying to get Johnny.

5852
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:55,600
How could you forget about Johnny?

5853
02:53:55,800 --> 02:53:56,420
He's been there.

5854
02:53:56,420 --> 02:53:56,560
He's been there.

5855
02:53:56,580 --> 02:53:57,400
He's been there for us.

5856
02:53:57,900 --> 02:53:58,620
Yes, Papa.

5857
02:53:59,500 --> 02:53:59,920
All right.

5858
02:53:59,940 --> 02:54:00,740
I don't think there's anomalies.

5859
02:54:00,780 --> 02:54:01,420
I don't think so either.

5860
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:02,680
All right.

5861
02:54:02,680 --> 02:54:02,840
Here we go.

5862
02:54:02,840 --> 02:54:04,020
Finally, the closer one.

5863
02:54:04,480 --> 02:54:04,700
Yay!

5864
02:54:05,600 --> 02:54:05,960
Yay!

5865
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:08,820
Every time, I was like, ba-dum.

5866
02:54:08,940 --> 02:54:09,560
I feel like we're in there.

5867
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:09,640
Wait.

5868
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:11,380
People are saying, oh, we missed it.

5869
02:54:11,740 --> 02:54:12,100
Wait.

5870
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:12,660
What was there?

5871
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:13,100
What?

5872
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:13,700
Huh?

5873
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:17,140
That was you.

5874
02:54:17,180 --> 02:54:17,680
You called it.

5875
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:18,580
No, I didn't!

5876
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:19,140
That was you.

5877
02:54:19,160 --> 02:54:19,720
You called it.

5878
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:20,320
You called it.

5879
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:20,920
You called it.

5880
02:54:20,920 --> 02:54:21,440
You called it.

5881
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:21,940
You called it.

5882
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:22,800
You called it.

5883
02:54:22,800 --> 02:54:23,120
You called it.

5884
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:23,360
You called it.

5885
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:26,680
You were like, we're stuck in floor 500 forever!

5886
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:28,580
The door was backwards?

5887
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:29,060
Wait.

5888
02:54:29,140 --> 02:54:29,360
How...

5889
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:30,220
What do you mean the door was?

5890
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:31,900
How can a door be backwards?

5891
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:33,420
Okay.

5892
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:34,800
This is the normal one, remember?

5893
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:35,040
Oh, yeah.

5894
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:35,620
This is the...

5895
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:36,240
Yeah, that's right.

5896
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:37,320
I always forget it.

5897
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:40,660
We're going to be stuck in floor 500.

5898
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:51,740
I could tell you were hydrating before the cry.

5899
02:54:53,620 --> 02:54:55,220
Oh, it's on the wrong hinges.

5900
02:54:55,400 --> 02:54:56,940
Oh my god, so that's something else we have to...

5901
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:59,720
We have to keep track of the wrong hinges?

5902
02:54:59,800 --> 02:55:00,880
So right now... oh no.

5903
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:02,920
Yeah, right now it's backwards.

5904
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:03,240
Oh, it's backwards.

5905
02:55:03,540 --> 02:55:04,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5906
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:06,040
Oh good, we got it out of the way.

5907
02:55:07,080 --> 02:55:08,900
That is such a sneaky one.

5908
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:09,520
That is so...

5909
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:12,700
That should have been a floor 516 one right there.

5910
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:19,160
Not stupid!

5911
02:55:19,740 --> 02:55:20,920
People miss that too!

5912
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:23,960
Yeah, everyone has probably missed that in their lives.

5913
02:55:24,060 --> 02:55:24,880
Yeah, everybody.

5914
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:26,960
Those who called out have played this game before.

5915
02:55:27,060 --> 02:55:27,600
I can tell.

5916
02:55:30,580 --> 02:55:31,100
Johnny?

5917
02:55:31,100 --> 02:55:31,620
Johnny?

5918
02:55:31,800 --> 02:55:32,420
Yes, Papa?

5919
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:33,980
It's all the plugs.

5920
02:55:34,600 --> 02:55:35,340
All the plugs?

5921
02:55:35,560 --> 02:55:36,280
Oh yeah, it's...

5922
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:37,820
It's all the plugs.

5923
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:41,080
We're stuck in 500 forever.

5924
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:43,320
We'll never get to 666.

5925
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:43,920
He was right!

5926
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:45,500
The dev was right!

5927
02:55:45,560 --> 02:55:47,660
We will never get to 666!

5928
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:49,800
We're stuck here forever!

5929
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:52,100
It's Chad's fault.

5930
02:55:52,180 --> 02:55:53,360
They didn't warn us soon enough.

5931
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:56,060
They could have yelled at us.

5932
02:55:56,120 --> 02:55:57,100
They really could have.

5933
02:55:57,120 --> 02:55:59,800
They could have screamed if they knew it instantly.

5934
02:56:00,660 --> 02:56:04,420
I was going to say, I was going to say, But it seems so mean!

5935
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:06,540
It seems so...

5936
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:10,380
Come on!

5937
02:56:10,380 --> 02:56:11,240
Come on, Min!

5938
02:56:11,440 --> 02:56:12,080
Okay, I'm coming!

5939
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:12,920
I'm coming!

5940
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:13,840
I'm coming!

5941
02:56:13,920 --> 02:56:14,400
Come on, Min!

5942
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:14,960
I'm coming!

5943
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:16,300
I'm coming!

5944
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:17,120
I'm coming!

5945
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:18,500
I thought you were so good at this!

5946
02:56:18,760 --> 02:56:19,080
I'm coming!

5947
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:20,080
I'm coming!

5948
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:24,180
Oh, look at me.

5949
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:25,120
I actually got out.

5950
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:27,520
So it's clearly was just a skill issue for you.

5951
02:56:27,740 --> 02:56:28,360
Oh, yeah.

5952
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:30,440
It's not like I helped you get there.

5953
02:56:30,740 --> 02:56:32,240
It's like, how could you push me out?

5954
02:56:32,320 --> 02:56:34,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

5955
02:56:35,140 --> 02:56:37,280
I helped you get there.

5956
02:56:38,940 --> 02:56:42,500
Guys, guys, if you guys see any anomalies, make sure to...

5957
02:56:45,020 --> 02:56:49,120
We will totally see, and we won't miss it at all.

5958
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:49,300
Awww.

5959
02:56:49,340 --> 02:56:49,580
Yeah.

5960
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:54,780
There's no sixes.

5961
02:56:54,920 --> 02:56:56,300
I think there's no anomalies.

5962
02:56:56,340 --> 02:56:56,660
Yeah.

5963
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:58,400
Guys, this is your chance right now.

5964
02:56:58,420 --> 02:56:59,680
We're saying there's no anomalies.

5965
02:56:59,860 --> 02:57:01,080
This is your chance.

5966
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:03,300
I'm gonna look at everything really slowly.

5967
02:57:03,480 --> 02:57:04,480
I'm gonna look at everything really slowly.

5968
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:07,780
We're gonna look at this really slowly.

5969
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:09,160
No anomalies.

5970
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:12,360
If there was an anomaly, it's not our fault.

5971
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:13,520
We gave you a chance.

5972
02:57:14,100 --> 02:57:14,900
No Elf.

5973
02:57:16,580 --> 02:57:17,460
No Elf.

5974
02:57:17,620 --> 02:57:18,540
No Elf.

5975
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:20,440
Alright, here we go.

5976
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:21,080
Up we go.

5977
02:57:22,820 --> 02:57:23,260
Bing!

5978
02:57:23,260 --> 02:57:23,740
Up we go.

5979
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:25,940
Bing!

5980
02:57:25,940 --> 02:57:26,380
505!

5981
02:57:27,180 --> 02:57:27,620
505!

5982
02:57:29,300 --> 02:57:29,740
Johnny?

5983
02:57:29,880 --> 02:57:30,280
Johnny?

5984
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:30,940
Johnny?

5985
02:57:31,020 --> 02:57:31,260
Johnny?

5986
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:31,700
Johnny?

5987
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:35,600
What if we both have to be inside though?

5988
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:37,620
Nah, I don't think so.

5989
02:57:38,720 --> 02:57:40,920
Cause like, what if it's a solo, single player?

5990
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:43,400
A single player, it wouldn't matter.

5991
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:45,360
Yeah, because they would be inside.

5992
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:47,500
No, wait, what?

5993
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:48,060
Oh yeah!

5994
02:57:51,180 --> 02:57:51,660
Okay.

5995
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:52,420
Okay.

5996
02:57:52,720 --> 02:57:53,580
Okay, doggie.

5997
02:57:55,660 --> 02:57:57,340
Alright, no anomalies.

5998
02:57:57,440 --> 02:57:59,560
No, we have to go to the further one.

5999
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:00,540
No!

6000
02:58:00,840 --> 02:58:02,920
Maybe it'll give us back to back no anomalies.

6001
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:04,020
She's an actual bird.

6002
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:11,160
What does that say about you, huh?

6003
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:12,540
You've messed up too.

6004
02:58:12,800 --> 02:58:14,200
Not as much as you.

6005
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:16,780
At least people can say I'm a bird brain.

6006
02:58:16,880 --> 02:58:17,780
What about you then?

6007
02:58:18,040 --> 02:58:18,520
I'm dead.

6008
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:21,100
I have like, my brain is ectoplasm.

6009
02:58:22,240 --> 02:58:23,920
It's literal mush, okay?

6010
02:58:25,420 --> 02:58:26,220
Oh, smileys.

6011
02:58:27,320 --> 02:58:27,720
Smileys.

6012
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:29,860
Okay, back to the long one we go.

6013
02:58:29,960 --> 02:58:31,660
Back to the long one we go.

6014
02:58:31,660 --> 02:58:32,300
Don't worry, I'll speed you up.

6015
02:58:32,480 --> 02:58:33,480
I'm gonna speed you up.

6016
02:58:33,560 --> 02:58:34,900
Actually, you're really not doing anything.

6017
02:58:39,820 --> 02:58:41,240
It's like I'm getting a massage.

6018
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:45,420
I'm a chiropractor, not licensed.

6019
02:58:48,140 --> 02:58:48,620
Alright.

6020
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:50,700
Next one.

6021
02:58:50,780 --> 02:58:53,940
Guys, we're so close to 513 again.

6022
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:55,300
Are we?

6023
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:56,460
We're gonna make it.

6024
02:58:56,620 --> 02:58:57,480
Are we that close?

6025
02:58:57,880 --> 02:58:59,040
We're... I don't know.

6026
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:00,980
Oh, it's the heads.

6027
02:59:00,980 --> 02:59:01,460
It's the heads.

6028
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:02,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6029
02:59:02,460 --> 02:59:03,080
It's the bags.

6030
02:59:05,140 --> 02:59:05,960
It's the bags.

6031
02:59:05,980 --> 02:59:08,640
At least the shoes running is kind of ASMR.

6032
02:59:09,320 --> 02:59:10,220
Yeah, it is.

6033
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:14,700
You know, when it says hospital 666, I honestly thought the 6 was a joke.

6034
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:17,540
Wait, so do we get to like...

6035
02:59:17,540 --> 02:59:18,160
What happens?

6036
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:19,460
Do we get to just floor 6?

6037
02:59:19,760 --> 02:59:20,540
Or do we do this?

6038
02:59:20,540 --> 02:59:23,220
No, it's 666, so it could be like 613.

6039
02:59:23,320 --> 02:59:24,360
Like 615.

6040
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,700
And then it's all the way to 666 at the end.

6041
02:59:27,860 --> 02:59:28,140
Okay.

6042
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:29,120
Great.

6043
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:29,440
Alright.

6044
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:31,120
Johnny.

6045
02:59:31,740 --> 02:59:32,520
No Johnny.

6046
02:59:32,520 --> 02:59:33,400
Oh, it's the 666.

6047
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:34,640
Okay.

6048
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:36,640
Back to the long hallway we go.

6049
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:38,580
You didn't even go into the room.

6050
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:40,340
I wanna see the Johnny.

6051
02:59:40,500 --> 02:59:42,300
Yeah, but what if you have to come inside?

6052
02:59:42,900 --> 02:59:47,780
Well, if we have to go inside, I would've got inside to see if we triggered the Johnny.

6053
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:50,200
The Johnny.

6054
02:59:51,500 --> 02:59:53,120
That Johnny, that silly guy.

6055
02:59:53,540 --> 02:59:54,240
He's so silly.

6056
02:59:54,620 --> 02:59:55,740
I wanna see him too, though.

6057
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:57,780
Alright, I'll go inside.

6058
02:59:57,920 --> 02:59:59,200
We'll do Russian roulette again.

6059
02:59:59,500 --> 02:59:59,720
Okay, okay, okay.

6060
03:00:00,040 --> 03:00:02,580
Alright, one of us has to get the baby and the other one gets Johnny.

6061
03:00:03,740 --> 03:00:05,040
Oh, it pushed me inside!

6062
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:06,100
It pushed you inside!

6063
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:06,900
It forced me in!

6064
03:00:07,160 --> 03:00:10,340
We get the POV of Johnny again!

6065
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:11,540
Front row seats!

6066
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:13,780
I'm gonna get really close to him.

6067
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:15,260
Yeah, Johnny, we wanna see you.

6068
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:15,420
Woah!

6069
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:16,660
We wanna see your face.

6070
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:17,120
Woah!

6071
03:00:18,320 --> 03:00:19,280
Woah!

6072
03:00:19,820 --> 03:00:20,560
Woah!

6073
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:22,980
There's Johnny!

6074
03:00:26,960 --> 03:00:28,820
There he is!

6075
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:30,720
There's Johnny!

6076
03:00:33,020 --> 03:00:35,280
Sounds like Freddy Fazbear's laugh.

6077
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:44,080
There's Johnny!

6078
03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:47,920
Oh my god, someone fucked a stupid meme and said, I see an anomaly!

6079
03:00:51,880 --> 03:00:54,040
Oh my gosh, thank you!

6080
03:00:55,360 --> 03:00:57,280
I never would've got...

6081
03:00:57,280 --> 03:00:59,640
Oh, brothers on fire, brothers on fire, brothers on fire.

6082
03:00:59,740 --> 03:01:02,820
Why is it always the long one with brothers on fire?

6083
03:01:03,220 --> 03:01:03,240
I don't know.

6084
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:14,240
This game is breaking us.

6085
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:21,220
We didn't think, we didn't realize when they said 666 it was literally 666.

6086
03:01:21,420 --> 03:01:22,140
666 hours.

6087
03:01:23,480 --> 03:01:24,680
666 hours.

6088
03:01:24,820 --> 03:01:26,960
You remember when we said 24 hour stream?

6089
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:28,220
We were not joking.

6090
03:01:28,420 --> 03:01:29,680
I guess not.

6091
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:30,520
We meant it.

6092
03:01:30,520 --> 03:01:33,480
Oh, it's the baby, it's the baby, it's the baby, it's the baby, it's the baby.

6093
03:01:34,500 --> 03:01:35,380
Don't go the wrong way.

6094
03:01:36,020 --> 03:01:38,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, push me faster.

6095
03:01:38,360 --> 03:01:39,200
Baby, baby, baby.

6096
03:01:39,700 --> 03:01:42,300
I think we didn't look at the baby, so the baby's not coming.

6097
03:01:42,500 --> 03:01:42,640
Yeah.

6098
03:01:43,320 --> 03:01:44,500
Yeah, that's stupid baby.

6099
03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:45,940
Keep going, you stupid baby.

6100
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,060
That's why you're a baby.

6101
03:01:48,060 --> 03:01:48,740
You should've died.

6102
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:50,380
You should've died by the baby this time.

6103
03:01:50,560 --> 03:01:52,440
Why was I supposed to die by the baby?

6104
03:01:52,440 --> 03:01:53,900
Because I died from the baby last time.

6105
03:01:54,480 --> 03:01:55,600
Yeah, but you're stupid.

6106
03:01:57,920 --> 03:02:00,780
Yeah, because totally I knew that looking at a baby would kill me.

6107
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:03,120
I told you I'm not ready to be a mother!

6108
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:04,740
I told you I'm not ready to be a mother!

6109
03:02:04,740 --> 03:02:08,120
Well, I saw that Tokyo jungle play through.

6110
03:02:08,300 --> 03:02:08,380
Well, I saw that Tokyo jungle play through.

6111
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:10,500
You were so ready to be a mother.

6112
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:14,880
You should play that game.

6113
03:02:15,140 --> 03:02:16,820
You should build...

6114
03:02:16,820 --> 03:02:19,420
You taught me that I killed like your little birdies.

6115
03:02:19,420 --> 03:02:20,280
You taught me that I killed like your little birdies.

6116
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:22,300
Or is there an anomaly?

6117
03:02:23,320 --> 03:02:24,260
Is there an anomaly?

6118
03:02:26,440 --> 03:02:27,980
Why are you just standing back there?

6119
03:02:28,360 --> 03:02:29,880
Because there was no anomaly.

6120
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:30,560
What are you doing?

6121
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:32,020
Oh my god.

6122
03:02:32,360 --> 03:02:33,180
Oh my god.

6123
03:02:33,180 --> 03:02:33,720
Oh my god.

6124
03:02:33,720 --> 03:02:34,280
Oh my god.

6125
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:35,200
Oh my god.

6126
03:02:35,240 --> 03:02:35,700
Oh my god.

6127
03:02:35,740 --> 03:02:36,200
Oh my god.

6128
03:02:36,540 --> 03:02:37,680
I almost did it.

6129
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:38,700
I almost did it.

6130
03:02:38,820 --> 03:02:40,100
What are you doing?

6131
03:02:43,340 --> 03:02:45,900
There was no Akasupa, so she couldn't tell, guys.

6132
03:02:45,940 --> 03:02:46,060
I know.

6133
03:02:46,160 --> 03:02:47,020
You guys...

6134
03:02:47,560 --> 03:02:50,080
Guys, I was the Akasupa, but I did it for free.

6135
03:02:50,460 --> 03:02:53,960
The way you were standing in the hall was so menacing.

6136
03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:56,920
What haven't we gotten?

6137
03:02:57,460 --> 03:02:59,320
I was like, what is she doing?

6138
03:02:59,780 --> 03:03:00,220
No way.

6139
03:03:00,340 --> 03:03:01,880
There has to be an anomaly in here.

6140
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:03,160
There's no anomaly.

6141
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:03,880
No.

6142
03:03:04,100 --> 03:03:04,580
No.

6143
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:05,640
Guys, we're waiting.

6144
03:03:05,660 --> 03:03:07,700
We're waiting for the Akasupa right now.

6145
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:08,320
Wait.

6146
03:03:08,340 --> 03:03:08,520
Wait.

6147
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:09,400
There's something on the floor.

6148
03:03:09,800 --> 03:03:11,060
Is that... Oh, it's been like that.

6149
03:03:11,360 --> 03:03:12,680
Yeah, it's a face on the floor.

6150
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:13,500
It is.

6151
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:14,220
Oh, shit.

6152
03:03:14,260 --> 03:03:15,160
It's Salad Fingers.

6153
03:03:19,280 --> 03:03:20,740
We got something new.

6154
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:23,100
We went past Fort 513.

6155
03:03:23,700 --> 03:03:25,000
We went past it.

6156
03:03:25,600 --> 03:03:25,980
Yay!

6157
03:03:26,300 --> 03:03:26,980
New record!

6158
03:03:28,120 --> 03:03:29,060
Salad Fingers.

6159
03:03:29,980 --> 03:03:30,480
God.

6160
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:32,640
First Doctor Horrible.

6161
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:35,940
What does it say about you?

6162
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:37,460
You recognize these references.

6163
03:03:40,440 --> 03:03:42,480
You recognize the references, too.

6164
03:03:42,480 --> 03:03:44,400
There hasn't been anything with Brother yet.

6165
03:03:45,400 --> 03:03:47,940
I mean, there was one where he grew taller, right?

6166
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:48,700
Oh, no, no.

6167
03:03:48,740 --> 03:03:49,240
He exploded.

6168
03:03:49,260 --> 03:03:49,700
Just kidding.

6169
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:51,400
Yeah, he exploded.

6170
03:03:51,600 --> 03:03:51,880
Yeah.

6171
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:53,440
Why did the Brother explode?

6172
03:03:53,880 --> 03:03:54,940
Why did he explode?

6173
03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:56,220
Not just once, but three times.

6174
03:03:56,220 --> 03:03:57,960
I don't think there's actually one in here.

6175
03:03:58,520 --> 03:03:59,500
I don't think so either.

6176
03:03:59,580 --> 03:04:00,220
I don't see anything.

6177
03:04:01,020 --> 03:04:02,640
There's no faces on the floor.

6178
03:04:03,380 --> 03:04:07,140
And someone gave me a blue Super Chat and was like, Akasupa.

6179
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:12,720
Wait, does that mean there's anomaly or there's no anomaly?

6180
03:04:13,060 --> 03:04:14,100
Does blue mean safe?

6181
03:04:17,260 --> 03:04:18,620
Alright, here we go.

6182
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:20,740
Swipe or no swiping?

6183
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:22,320
Here we go.

6184
03:04:23,280 --> 03:04:23,680
Alright.

6185
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:24,960
This is the right.

6186
03:04:25,060 --> 03:04:25,960
This is the correct elevator.

6187
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:27,820
Because there's no anomalies.

6188
03:04:27,880 --> 03:04:28,880
There's no anomalies.

6189
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,500
Why are you having me press it?

6190
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:34,340
You made up the rule.

6191
03:04:34,740 --> 03:04:36,620
You are the one that made up the rule.

6192
03:04:38,820 --> 03:04:39,620
5-15.

6193
03:04:40,240 --> 03:04:41,260
5-15, you guys.

6194
03:04:41,620 --> 03:04:43,580
Has there been one that we haven't done yet?

6195
03:04:43,640 --> 03:04:44,300
That we haven't saw?

6196
03:04:44,580 --> 03:04:45,420
I think we haven't...

6197
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:46,180
Oh, this one.

6198
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:47,340
It's this one.

6199
03:04:47,500 --> 03:04:47,720
Yeah.

6200
03:04:48,660 --> 03:04:49,060
Dang.

6201
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:49,840
It's the blue screen.

6202
03:04:49,880 --> 03:04:51,520
This was the first one we got, I think.

6203
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:52,640
So it was long time ago.

6204
03:04:52,820 --> 03:04:53,200
Yeah, yeah.

6205
03:04:53,200 --> 03:04:54,740
Yeah, and then it like threw us off.

6206
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:56,020
Because we fire who was real.

6207
03:04:56,380 --> 03:04:57,400
5-16.

6208
03:04:57,400 --> 03:04:59,420
And I think we haven't gotten the one with the...

6209
03:04:59,420 --> 03:05:00,540
Lots of plugs, right?

6210
03:05:01,500 --> 03:05:02,000
No, we did.

6211
03:05:02,200 --> 03:05:03,460
You're the one that called it out.

6212
03:05:03,780 --> 03:05:05,420
Wasn't that on the previous run, though?

6213
03:05:06,100 --> 03:05:06,960
Oh, you're right.

6214
03:05:08,060 --> 03:05:08,840
Wait, you're right.

6215
03:05:09,080 --> 03:05:09,860
Oh, you're right, yeah.

6216
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:11,040
Or did we?

6217
03:05:11,060 --> 03:05:11,520
I can't remember.

6218
03:05:11,740 --> 03:05:13,540
Everything's blending together, you guys.

6219
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:14,900
All these floors.

6220
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:16,520
We went through so many floors.

6221
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:17,360
No.

6222
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:19,380
I don't know, actually.

6223
03:05:19,540 --> 03:05:19,920
Brother?

6224
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:20,620
I don't know.

6225
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:21,760
Brother?

6226
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:22,720
Brother?

6227
03:05:22,880 --> 03:05:23,500
Brother, help.

6228
03:05:23,860 --> 03:05:24,260
4-5.

6229
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:26,200
Brother, we don't know.

6230
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:29,240
I think there's nothing here.

6231
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:30,360
Are you sure?

6232
03:05:31,540 --> 03:05:33,080
Oh, you're trusting me, now?

6233
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:33,880
Are you sure?

6234
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:36,860
No, I mean, I'm not trusting you.

6235
03:05:38,420 --> 03:05:38,820
Brother.

6236
03:05:39,580 --> 03:05:40,100
That's true.

6237
03:05:40,860 --> 03:05:42,080
No, it ain't me.

6238
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:42,660
Guys, I don't know.

6239
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:44,840
If we fuck up, we go back to zero.

6240
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:45,780
All the way to zero.

6241
03:05:45,820 --> 03:05:46,600
If we go...

6242
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:49,000
Guys, you don't want to go back to zero, guys.

6243
03:05:49,200 --> 03:05:50,780
Okay, here we go, here we go, here we go.

6244
03:05:50,800 --> 03:05:51,060
Here we go.

6245
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:51,500
Everybody go, everybody go.

6246
03:05:53,560 --> 03:05:54,120
Here we go!

6247
03:05:54,120 --> 03:05:55,640
Oh, you press it.

6248
03:05:55,780 --> 03:05:56,460
Here we go.

6249
03:05:56,500 --> 03:05:57,660
Why am I pressing it?

6250
03:05:57,740 --> 03:05:58,720
Because I pressed it last time!

6251
03:05:59,320 --> 03:06:00,340
Alright, here we go.

6252
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:01,960
Here we go.

6253
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:03,060
Come on.

6254
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:04,140
Come on.

6255
03:06:04,280 --> 03:06:04,840
SCP!

6256
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:06,060
SCP!

6257
03:06:07,020 --> 03:06:07,580
SCP!

6258
03:06:08,180 --> 03:06:08,240
SCP!

6259
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:08,580
SCP!

6260
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:12,300
You.

6261
03:06:12,860 --> 03:06:13,420
You.

6262
03:06:14,380 --> 03:06:14,580
No.

6263
03:06:14,800 --> 03:06:15,280
Chat.

6264
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:21,700
Did we miss?

6265
03:06:22,240 --> 03:06:24,380
Why did we miss?

6266
03:06:25,760 --> 03:06:27,400
There was no anomalies.

6267
03:06:28,260 --> 03:06:29,840
Did we go to the wrong elevator?

6268
03:06:30,380 --> 03:06:30,820
No.

6269
03:06:30,960 --> 03:06:31,800
No, we didn't.

6270
03:06:32,320 --> 03:06:33,700
No, no, we didn't.

6271
03:06:33,700 --> 03:06:33,860
Yeah.

6272
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:34,620
Yeah, that's right.

6273
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:35,980
This is the first level.

6274
03:06:36,540 --> 03:06:36,980
No.

6275
03:06:37,160 --> 03:06:37,560
Oh, wait.

6276
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:38,160
Someone said review.

6277
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:38,960
We can go review.

6278
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:39,920
We can go review it.

6279
03:06:39,980 --> 03:06:40,600
What did we do?

6280
03:06:41,440 --> 03:06:43,180
Okay, now we have to review.

6281
03:06:43,860 --> 03:06:44,600
No way.

6282
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:46,180
No way.

6283
03:06:46,360 --> 03:06:47,280
No way.

6284
03:06:47,940 --> 03:06:48,380
No way.

6285
03:06:50,620 --> 03:06:51,500
No anomalies.

6286
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:52,780
It wasn't the door.

6287
03:06:52,780 --> 03:06:53,860
We got that one.

6288
03:06:53,940 --> 03:06:55,280
It was like the first one we got.

6289
03:06:55,940 --> 03:06:55,940
Yeah.

6290
03:06:56,560 --> 03:06:58,280
Nobody super chatted us.

6291
03:06:58,380 --> 03:06:59,200
No smileys.

6292
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:00,080
No one else noticed.

6293
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:02,080
Nobody noticed.

6294
03:07:02,980 --> 03:07:03,960
Anything in the trash?

6295
03:07:04,900 --> 03:07:05,340
245.

6296
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:05,600
245.

6297
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:06,400
245.

6298
03:07:07,140 --> 03:07:07,580
245.

6299
03:07:10,320 --> 03:07:10,760
There's...

6300
03:07:12,160 --> 03:07:13,580
Is it like a time thing?

6301
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:14,780
Like with the head, you know?

6302
03:07:14,860 --> 03:07:16,640
Like we weren't looking in the right direction.

6303
03:07:17,780 --> 03:07:18,660
Someone said...

6304
03:07:19,100 --> 03:07:19,980
Under the shelf?

6305
03:07:20,180 --> 03:07:20,980
Is it this box?

6306
03:07:23,080 --> 03:07:23,760
Yeah.

6307
03:07:23,800 --> 03:07:24,900
That thing looks weird.

6308
03:07:25,960 --> 03:07:27,580
Oh my god.

6309
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:28,380
What?

6310
03:07:28,700 --> 03:07:29,580
Look up.

6311
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:30,860
Up?

6312
03:07:31,440 --> 03:07:32,380
Look up.

6313
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:33,860
Look up?

6314
03:07:37,240 --> 03:07:37,580
Here?

6315
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:39,160
Look up.

6316
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:39,500
No.

6317
03:07:40,120 --> 03:07:41,380
Are you kidding me?

6318
03:07:41,780 --> 03:07:42,980
Do you see it?

6319
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:44,680
Is it the 666666?

6320
03:07:44,680 --> 03:07:46,840
Look up at the box too.

6321
03:07:46,840 --> 03:07:47,740
Look up.

6322
03:07:47,880 --> 03:07:48,160
It's the...

6323
03:07:48,160 --> 03:07:49,500
This box right here.

6324
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,280
They said look up.

6325
03:07:52,420 --> 03:07:54,940
There's 6666 labels.

6326
03:07:56,980 --> 03:07:58,640
Oh my god.

6327
03:07:58,800 --> 03:07:59,420
Oh my god.

6328
03:07:59,440 --> 03:07:59,800
Here too.

6329
03:08:00,080 --> 03:08:01,140
Oh my god.

6330
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:06,860
Chat didn't know either.

6331
03:08:07,060 --> 03:08:08,260
Chat didn't know either.

6332
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:09,140
There was no super chat.

6333
03:08:09,300 --> 03:08:10,580
Chat didn't know either.

6334
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:11,760
You can't blame it on us.

6335
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:12,540
Apparently there's like...

6336
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:14,660
Oh, all the bottles say 6662.

6337
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:16,640
Oh, they used to say ethanol.

6338
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:21,020
I thought there would only be one 666 because it's the trash cans.

6339
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:21,920
They always...

6340
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:23,500
They baited us.

6341
03:08:23,580 --> 03:08:27,200
They always did one and now it's like several?

6342
03:08:27,320 --> 03:08:28,420
Now it's two?

6343
03:08:29,020 --> 03:08:30,200
This is messed up.

6344
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:30,980
This is messed up.

6345
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:33,720
It's not our fault, guys.

6346
03:08:33,900 --> 03:08:35,140
It's never the streamer's fault.

6347
03:08:37,620 --> 03:08:40,220
One chat member got the labels right.

6348
03:08:40,220 --> 03:08:41,620
No, this is so messed up.

6349
03:08:41,780 --> 03:08:43,320
One guy in the correct direction.

6350
03:08:44,840 --> 03:08:47,260
The one guy was actually correct.

6351
03:08:47,420 --> 03:08:47,920
What is this?

6352
03:08:47,920 --> 03:08:48,180
Oh my god.

6353
03:08:48,380 --> 03:08:49,700
And on the final thing.

6354
03:08:49,780 --> 03:08:51,320
On the final one.

6355
03:08:51,440 --> 03:08:52,800
That was so cheesy.

6356
03:08:53,020 --> 03:08:54,620
That was so cheap.

6357
03:08:55,160 --> 03:08:56,240
Oh my god.

6358
03:08:56,240 --> 03:08:57,000
So cheap.

6359
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:59,500
We were so happy getting to the sixth...

6360
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:01,740
Bro, we're stuck at 500 forever.

6361
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:03,280
It's okay.

6362
03:09:03,360 --> 03:09:03,920
We can speedrun.

6363
03:09:04,020 --> 03:09:04,440
We can speedrun.

6364
03:09:04,500 --> 03:09:05,300
We know everything now.

6365
03:09:05,400 --> 03:09:06,040
We know them all.

6366
03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:08,460
Speedrun.

6367
03:09:08,500 --> 03:09:08,820
Speedrun.

6368
03:09:08,820 --> 03:09:09,060
Speedrun.

6369
03:09:09,240 --> 03:09:09,680
Speedrun.

6370
03:09:11,380 --> 03:09:11,780
Speedrun.

6371
03:09:11,780 --> 03:09:11,780
Speedrun.

6372
03:09:11,780 --> 03:09:11,780
Speedrun.

6373
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:14,260
What is it?

6374
03:09:14,940 --> 03:09:15,340
666.

6375
03:09:15,560 --> 03:09:16,160
On the...

6376
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:18,560
Wrong elevator.

6377
03:09:19,900 --> 03:09:20,840
I saw you.

6378
03:09:20,900 --> 03:09:22,420
I saw you running over there.

6379
03:09:22,500 --> 03:09:23,280
I saw it.

6380
03:09:25,800 --> 03:09:26,200
Alright.

6381
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:27,020
Okay.

6382
03:09:27,280 --> 03:09:27,680
Okay.

6383
03:09:27,680 --> 03:09:27,940
Okay.

6384
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:28,800
Okay.

6385
03:09:28,840 --> 03:09:29,300
We got this.

6386
03:09:29,660 --> 03:09:30,060
Wait.

6387
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:32,260
What 666 was it?

6388
03:09:32,300 --> 03:09:33,560
Was it on the trash can or the labels?

6389
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:34,980
It was on the trash can.

6390
03:09:35,440 --> 03:09:41,620
Okay, okay, I'm keeping track so we can, like, if we get all the anomalies left, then we can just press...

6391
03:09:41,620 --> 03:09:47,580
Oh, okay, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, not us being, like, so excited for some of these.

6392
03:09:48,580 --> 03:09:51,140
We're gonna have to get the box one all over again, too.

6393
03:09:51,540 --> 03:09:52,140
Oh, no.

6394
03:09:54,060 --> 03:09:55,960
Alright, I know how to do this faster.

6395
03:09:56,260 --> 03:09:56,620
How?

6396
03:09:56,840 --> 03:09:57,740
One person goes?

6397
03:09:58,260 --> 03:09:58,660
Yeah.

6398
03:09:58,800 --> 03:10:01,680
Okay, okay, there I go.

6399
03:10:04,100 --> 03:10:05,040
There I go.

6400
03:10:06,420 --> 03:10:08,580
It's gonna force you in here once there's Johnny.

6401
03:10:10,980 --> 03:10:11,880
It's the bags.

6402
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:13,560
It's a bag?

6403
03:10:13,740 --> 03:10:14,020
See?

6404
03:10:14,240 --> 03:10:15,560
Look at how fast it is.

6405
03:10:15,780 --> 03:10:17,560
So I can just press the button when you're...

6406
03:10:17,560 --> 03:10:18,340
Once I'm here?

6407
03:10:18,740 --> 03:10:19,520
What if it's nothing?

6408
03:10:19,780 --> 03:10:20,340
What if it's nothing?

6409
03:10:20,580 --> 03:10:21,680
What if you have to go all the way back?

6410
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:23,780
I'm gonna lie to you at some point.

6411
03:10:23,860 --> 03:10:25,100
I'm gonna tell you that it's...

6412
03:10:25,100 --> 03:10:27,060
We all wanna leave the hospital!

6413
03:10:29,940 --> 03:10:31,200
If you lie!

6414
03:10:31,220 --> 03:10:31,660
If you lie!

6415
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:33,140
It affects you, too!

6416
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:38,520
Here we go.

6417
03:10:43,980 --> 03:10:44,820
It's the boxes.

6418
03:10:45,680 --> 03:10:46,380
I'm coming out.

6419
03:10:46,380 --> 03:10:46,780
No, really?

6420
03:10:47,060 --> 03:10:47,660
I'm coming out.

6421
03:10:47,820 --> 03:10:48,380
I'm leaving.

6422
03:10:48,580 --> 03:10:49,600
I'm getting out of here.

6423
03:10:49,880 --> 03:10:50,280
Really?

6424
03:10:50,560 --> 03:10:51,160
I'm coming out.

6425
03:10:51,180 --> 03:10:51,600
The boxes?

6426
03:10:51,860 --> 03:10:53,580
Wait, I thought you were an expert on this.

6427
03:10:53,640 --> 03:10:54,060
What happened?

6428
03:10:54,420 --> 03:10:55,040
I'm coming out.

6429
03:10:55,700 --> 03:10:56,100
Yeah?

6430
03:10:56,260 --> 03:10:57,060
Any second now?

6431
03:10:57,220 --> 03:10:57,700
I'm coming out.

6432
03:10:57,820 --> 03:10:59,940
Do you see the boxes, like, getting pushed from the...

6433
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:01,320
I'm coming out.

6434
03:11:02,180 --> 03:11:03,240
I'm coming out.

6435
03:11:03,920 --> 03:11:04,860
I'm coming out.

6436
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:06,720
The boxes are gonna disappear soon.

6437
03:11:06,980 --> 03:11:07,500
I'm coming out.

6438
03:11:08,100 --> 03:11:09,000
I'm coming out.

6439
03:11:09,140 --> 03:11:10,720
You see, I'm kicking them one by one.

6440
03:11:11,020 --> 03:11:11,960
I'm coming out.

6441
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:14,660
Oh, there you are.

6442
03:11:14,800 --> 03:11:16,340
It disappeared, didn't it?

6443
03:11:16,420 --> 03:11:16,840
No, it didn't.

6444
03:11:16,840 --> 03:11:17,360
You didn't do it yourself.

6445
03:11:17,420 --> 03:11:19,380
No, I punched my way out.

6446
03:11:19,400 --> 03:11:21,260
You did not do it yourself.

6447
03:11:21,460 --> 03:11:22,680
You didn't do it yourself.

6448
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:25,420
You didn't do it yourself.

6449
03:11:26,200 --> 03:11:27,260
Oh, my God.

6450
03:11:28,980 --> 03:11:30,260
Oh, my God.

6451
03:11:30,320 --> 03:11:31,000
Here we go.

6452
03:11:31,960 --> 03:11:34,260
I'm on my way because...

6453
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:34,760
You got this.

6454
03:11:34,940 --> 03:11:36,800
Doki's too much of a baby.

6455
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:38,840
I am not a baby.

6456
03:11:38,960 --> 03:11:40,820
I am trying to be efficient here.

6457
03:11:40,920 --> 03:11:42,600
I am not a baby.

6458
03:11:42,840 --> 03:11:44,540
I'm not a baby.

6459
03:11:44,980 --> 03:11:47,100
I think... Wait, hold on.

6460
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:47,780
Let me check the labels.

6461
03:11:47,840 --> 03:11:48,360
Okay.

6462
03:11:50,100 --> 03:11:50,620
Smiley's.

6463
03:11:50,620 --> 03:11:51,140
Smiley's.

6464
03:11:51,140 --> 03:11:51,660
Smiley's.

6465
03:11:51,660 --> 03:11:52,160
Smiley's.

6466
03:11:52,180 --> 03:11:52,500
Smiley's.

6467
03:11:52,540 --> 03:11:52,560
Smiley's.

6468
03:11:52,820 --> 03:11:53,980
Smiley's on the light switch?

6469
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:54,520
Yes.

6470
03:11:54,800 --> 03:11:55,320
Okay.

6471
03:11:55,660 --> 03:11:58,060
Oh, my God.

6472
03:11:58,700 --> 03:11:59,800
We fucked up.

6473
03:12:00,320 --> 03:12:02,340
Four or five hundred like four times, right?

6474
03:12:02,740 --> 03:12:03,940
No, it was like three.

6475
03:12:04,120 --> 03:12:04,680
It was like three.

6476
03:12:05,040 --> 03:12:06,740
Oh, now you can count.

6477
03:12:06,800 --> 03:12:08,640
I think this is our third run.

6478
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:11,920
Now you can count.

6479
03:12:12,180 --> 03:12:13,040
Oh, no.

6480
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:13,800
Actually, you don't.

6481
03:12:13,820 --> 03:12:14,860
This is our fourth run.

6482
03:12:15,020 --> 03:12:16,300
This is actually our fourth run.

6483
03:12:16,300 --> 03:12:16,320
It is?

6484
03:12:16,320 --> 03:12:16,840
For real?

6485
03:12:16,940 --> 03:12:17,680
No way.

6486
03:12:17,800 --> 03:12:18,200
Yeah.

6487
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,840
I'm with you this time because I think it's no anomaly time.

6488
03:12:22,040 --> 03:12:22,720
I think you're right.

6489
03:12:24,860 --> 03:12:25,960
I'm double checking everything.

6490
03:12:27,380 --> 03:12:27,780
Okay.

6491
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:28,380
You're right.

6492
03:12:28,380 --> 03:12:31,600
And you see, I'm so good at gambling.

6493
03:12:35,360 --> 03:12:37,440
Probability wise, I was right.

6494
03:12:38,720 --> 03:12:39,620
This game.

6495
03:12:40,940 --> 03:12:41,540
Okay.

6496
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:43,420
Oh, my God.

6497
03:12:43,460 --> 03:12:44,580
It's so intense now.

6498
03:12:44,580 --> 03:12:44,720
Oh, God.

6499
03:12:44,720 --> 03:12:45,540
It's so intense.

6500
03:12:46,280 --> 03:12:47,800
Oh, brother is exploding.

6501
03:12:48,160 --> 03:12:48,960
Brother is exploding.

6502
03:12:49,220 --> 03:12:50,220
Oh, this time it's a close one.

6503
03:12:51,360 --> 03:12:52,120
All right.

6504
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:53,140
Exploding brother.

6505
03:12:53,400 --> 03:12:54,140
Goodbye, brother.

6506
03:12:54,360 --> 03:12:55,860
We are missing the label six.

6507
03:12:55,860 --> 03:13:00,860
The label, the baby, the six plugs and the body heads.

6508
03:13:01,140 --> 03:13:04,140
Wait, the labels, the baby.

6509
03:13:04,560 --> 03:13:05,420
The floor.

6510
03:13:06,340 --> 03:13:07,440
Oh, the face.

6511
03:13:07,960 --> 03:13:09,980
Face on the ground, salad fingers.

6512
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:10,980
No label.

6513
03:13:12,880 --> 03:13:14,380
See, I'm helping now.

6514
03:13:14,840 --> 03:13:15,940
Yeah, because we're close.

6515
03:13:17,380 --> 03:13:19,460
Now we have to go all the way to the other one.

6516
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:19,960
Yeah.

6517
03:13:20,380 --> 03:13:21,300
Yeah, I think we're good.

6518
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:22,340
All the way down.

6519
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:23,320
The hinges.

6520
03:13:23,480 --> 03:13:24,500
Yep, that's correct.

6521
03:13:24,500 --> 03:13:24,940
Okay.

6522
03:13:25,080 --> 03:13:25,840
Oh, that one.

6523
03:13:25,920 --> 03:13:26,320
Yeah.

6524
03:13:27,060 --> 03:13:29,620
I'm used to checking it on the way to running there.

6525
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:31,040
Yeah, we got Johnny.

6526
03:13:31,940 --> 03:13:32,340
Johnny.

6527
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:34,560
Don't forget the floor.

6528
03:13:34,580 --> 03:13:34,940
We're good.

6529
03:13:35,060 --> 03:13:35,360
We're good.

6530
03:13:35,800 --> 03:13:39,140
Unless I think it like slowly starts to appear, though.

6531
03:13:39,180 --> 03:13:42,040
So we might have to, like, wait a second.

6532
03:13:43,040 --> 03:13:43,640
Which one?

6533
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:44,140
The floor?

6534
03:13:44,380 --> 03:13:44,780
Yeah.

6535
03:13:44,820 --> 03:13:47,120
Like, it's like the fade in, like the QR code.

6536
03:13:47,140 --> 03:13:48,080
Oh, the QR code.

6537
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:48,320
Yeah.

6538
03:13:48,640 --> 03:13:49,040
Yeah.

6539
03:13:49,180 --> 03:13:50,120
I'm checking all.

6540
03:13:53,320 --> 03:13:53,720
Labels.

6541
03:13:53,720 --> 03:13:54,460
Nothing on the floor.

6542
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:57,140
The labels are disinfected.

6543
03:13:57,460 --> 03:13:57,820
Yeah.

6544
03:13:58,420 --> 03:14:01,040
Do we get the heads at the trash can yet?

6545
03:14:01,260 --> 03:14:02,320
Yeah, we already got that one.

6546
03:14:02,720 --> 03:14:03,080
Okay.

6547
03:14:03,180 --> 03:14:04,060
So we don't care about that.

6548
03:14:04,180 --> 03:14:04,620
So I think we're good.

6549
03:14:04,680 --> 03:14:05,140
No anomalies.

6550
03:14:05,260 --> 03:14:05,720
I think we're good.

6551
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:05,900
Yeah.

6552
03:14:06,580 --> 03:14:07,300
No anomalies.

6553
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:07,860
Check the door.

6554
03:14:07,900 --> 03:14:08,600
The door is good.

6555
03:14:08,820 --> 03:14:09,520
The door is good.

6556
03:14:09,700 --> 03:14:09,960
Okay.

6557
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:10,380
We're good.

6558
03:14:11,540 --> 03:14:12,360
We're getting better.

6559
03:14:12,460 --> 03:14:14,820
It only took us four tries, but we're getting better now.

6560
03:14:15,260 --> 03:14:15,620
Yes.

6561
03:14:16,660 --> 03:14:17,720
Oh, my God.

6562
03:14:19,500 --> 03:14:19,860
Bing.

6563
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:21,160
Yes.

6564
03:14:22,120 --> 03:14:22,480
Okay.

6565
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:23,000
Okay.

6566
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:26,480
Oh, my gosh.

6567
03:14:26,840 --> 03:14:27,240
Baby.

6568
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:27,600
Baby.

6569
03:14:27,780 --> 03:14:27,920
Baby.

6570
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:28,240
Baby.

6571
03:14:28,280 --> 03:14:28,680
Baby.

6572
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:29,020
Baby.

6573
03:14:29,020 --> 03:14:29,320
Baby.

6574
03:14:29,320 --> 03:14:29,440
Baby.

6575
03:14:29,440 --> 03:14:29,800
Baby.

6576
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:30,040
Baby.

6577
03:14:30,340 --> 03:14:31,680
All right.

6578
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:32,820
We got baby out of the way.

6579
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:35,160
We're still missing, Johnny, floor, labels.

6580
03:14:35,420 --> 03:14:36,360
Johnny floor, iB basket.

6581
03:14:37,080 --> 03:14:37,760
We got the trash bag.

6582
03:14:37,900 --> 03:14:38,100
Okay.

6583
03:14:38,180 --> 03:14:38,820
What was trash back?

6584
03:14:39,140 --> 03:14:39,840
The trash.

6585
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:40,100
Yeah.

6586
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:40,900
The trash bag that goes.

6587
03:14:41,900 --> 03:14:43,820
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...

6588
03:14:43,820 --> 03:14:44,940
Angelina not finding the trash bag Oh, Joanie.

6589
03:14:45,080 --> 03:14:45,500
It's Joanie.

6590
03:14:45,500 --> 03:14:46,040
Okay, it's Joanie.

6591
03:14:46,680 --> 03:14:47,480
Holy shit.

6592
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:54,540
I want him to look at me this time.

6593
03:14:54,700 --> 03:14:56,560
His eyes kind of look to the right.

6594
03:14:56,820 --> 03:14:57,480
You're right.

6595
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:13,800
What's wrong with us anymore?

6596
03:15:14,360 --> 03:15:17,640
We need to get to floor 666, you guys!

6597
03:15:19,860 --> 03:15:21,420
Please help us!

6598
03:15:21,460 --> 03:15:22,060
Help us!

6599
03:15:22,060 --> 03:15:22,860
Oh, the door hinges?

6600
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:24,500
We also gotta worry about the door hinges.

6601
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:25,380
666 labels!

6602
03:15:25,760 --> 03:15:26,620
666 labels!

6603
03:15:26,800 --> 03:15:27,460
Alright, nice!

6604
03:15:29,580 --> 03:15:30,040
Alright.

6605
03:15:39,240 --> 03:15:40,900
You sound like you're crying.

6606
03:15:41,860 --> 03:15:44,920
I think the door hinges are gonna be like the last one, man.

6607
03:15:45,140 --> 03:15:46,380
There's nothing on the floor.

6608
03:15:46,520 --> 03:15:47,160
Wait, what are we missing?

6609
03:15:47,400 --> 03:15:47,980
Oh, the floor?

6610
03:15:48,100 --> 03:15:49,160
We're missing the floor.

6611
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:50,720
We're missing the...

6612
03:15:52,100 --> 03:15:52,880
Door hinge.

6613
03:15:52,960 --> 03:15:53,780
The door hinge.

6614
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:54,320
I think there's nothing.

6615
03:15:54,380 --> 03:15:56,860
And also the one of all the, like, the extra plugs.

6616
03:15:57,060 --> 03:15:57,440
The six plugs, yeah.

6617
03:15:57,480 --> 03:15:58,800
There's nothing, so I think we're good.

6618
03:15:58,960 --> 03:15:59,400
I think we're good.

6619
03:15:59,740 --> 03:16:00,900
We're back to there.

6620
03:16:02,420 --> 03:16:04,140
We're back to there!

6621
03:16:04,180 --> 03:16:06,760
We still have a whole other floor!

6622
03:16:07,220 --> 03:16:09,060
We still have three more!

6623
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:14,160
Why did you suggest this?

6624
03:16:14,980 --> 03:16:15,520
I did.

6625
03:16:15,640 --> 03:16:17,640
Why did you agree to this?

6626
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:19,540
Fourteen!

6627
03:16:19,620 --> 03:16:20,040
Fourteen!

6628
03:16:20,380 --> 03:16:20,380
Fourteen!

6629
03:16:20,380 --> 03:16:20,820
Fourteen!

6630
03:16:20,820 --> 03:16:22,240
Uh, no, it's not the door hinge.

6631
03:16:22,580 --> 03:16:24,600
It should be... last three, right?

6632
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:25,980
I think so.

6633
03:16:26,400 --> 03:16:27,620
Last three, so it's all anomalies.

6634
03:16:29,160 --> 03:16:31,040
No, this one... unless it's the floor.

6635
03:16:31,060 --> 03:16:31,440
It's the floor.

6636
03:16:31,500 --> 03:16:31,840
It's the floor.

6637
03:16:32,340 --> 03:16:34,220
It's all three, so it's all how much you want to bet.

6638
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:36,260
Do you really want to do this?

6639
03:16:36,520 --> 03:16:39,720
Do you... do you really want to do this?

6640
03:16:39,720 --> 03:16:41,580
It's all... it's literally all anomalies!

6641
03:16:41,660 --> 03:16:42,560
You know I'm right!

6642
03:16:42,620 --> 03:16:43,300
Okay, okay.

6643
03:16:43,440 --> 03:16:43,880
We'll do it.

6644
03:16:43,940 --> 03:16:44,180
We'll do it.

6645
03:16:44,180 --> 03:16:44,300
We'll do it.

6646
03:16:44,300 --> 03:16:44,740
You know I'm right.

6647
03:16:44,780 --> 03:16:45,580
Okay, what are we missing?

6648
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:46,880
We're missing the door hinge.

6649
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:47,440
Yeah.

6650
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:48,780
Which we can see from here.

6651
03:16:48,860 --> 03:16:49,080
And we're missing the six.

6652
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:49,440
Yeah.

6653
03:16:49,440 --> 03:16:49,760
Which we can see from here.

6654
03:16:52,720 --> 03:16:53,520
It's the six plugs.

6655
03:16:54,140 --> 03:16:54,940
How much do you want to bet?

6656
03:16:55,340 --> 03:16:56,120
Okay, do it.

6657
03:16:56,180 --> 03:16:56,720
It's the six plugs.

6658
03:16:56,820 --> 03:16:57,160
Okay, do it.

6659
03:16:57,280 --> 03:16:58,000
Yeah, do it.

6660
03:16:58,040 --> 03:16:58,400
Do it.

6661
03:16:58,420 --> 03:16:58,980
Alright, I'm going to do it.

6662
03:16:59,860 --> 03:17:00,280
Do it.

6663
03:17:00,340 --> 03:17:01,020
It's the six plugs.

6664
03:17:01,100 --> 03:17:02,280
Alright, the moment of truth.

6665
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:02,460
Do it.

6666
03:17:10,120 --> 03:17:11,060
And it's the door hinge.

6667
03:17:11,140 --> 03:17:11,540
I can see it.

6668
03:17:11,600 --> 03:17:12,360
Yeah, I can see it from here.

6669
03:17:13,080 --> 03:17:13,800
Oh my gosh.

6670
03:17:14,040 --> 03:17:14,060
I told you!

6671
03:17:14,360 --> 03:17:15,120
I told you!

6672
03:17:15,260 --> 03:17:16,840
Okay, that pause though...

6673
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:18,580
I literally held my breath.

6674
03:17:18,640 --> 03:17:19,160
I couldn't...

6675
03:17:19,160 --> 03:17:19,800
Me too.

6676
03:17:19,800 --> 03:17:20,400
I was like...

6677
03:17:21,760 --> 03:17:22,980
Oh my gosh, it's the back room.

6678
03:17:23,100 --> 03:17:23,800
Are we in the back room?

6679
03:17:23,940 --> 03:17:25,640
We're in the back room.

6680
03:17:26,120 --> 03:17:27,800
I'm in the back room.

6681
03:17:29,720 --> 03:17:30,460
Is it me?

6682
03:17:30,600 --> 03:17:31,220
Is it me?

6683
03:17:31,280 --> 03:17:31,680
It's me.

6684
03:17:31,740 --> 03:17:32,140
It's me.

6685
03:17:32,160 --> 03:17:32,500
It's me.

6686
03:17:32,660 --> 03:17:34,320
I'm literally the sacrifice man.

6687
03:17:34,360 --> 03:17:35,400
You got to do this.

6688
03:17:35,440 --> 03:17:36,640
I'm trying to find it.

6689
03:17:36,680 --> 03:17:37,100
It's chasing me.

6690
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:39,060
I don't know what to do.

6691
03:17:39,460 --> 03:17:40,320
Oh my gosh.

6692
03:17:40,440 --> 03:17:40,460
It's right there.

6693
03:17:43,560 --> 03:17:44,440
Oh my gosh.

6694
03:17:45,280 --> 03:17:45,960
It's after me.

6695
03:17:46,200 --> 03:17:47,080
It's after me.

6696
03:17:47,080 --> 03:17:47,620
Oh my gosh.

6697
03:17:47,680 --> 03:17:48,140
No, wait.

6698
03:17:48,260 --> 03:17:49,480
It's to the left of the door.

6699
03:17:49,520 --> 03:17:50,500
No, I can't get in.

6700
03:17:50,560 --> 03:17:51,180
I can't get in.

6701
03:17:51,180 --> 03:17:52,020
That's the door.

6702
03:17:52,420 --> 03:17:53,020
That's the door.

6703
03:17:53,520 --> 03:17:54,040
That's the door.

6704
03:17:56,130 --> 03:17:56,490
No!

6705
03:17:57,750 --> 03:17:59,250
He has to break it.

6706
03:17:59,570 --> 03:18:01,210
He has to break it first.

6707
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:03,450
What is this bullshit?

6708
03:18:03,670 --> 03:18:05,310
How do we lead him to that?

6709
03:18:06,010 --> 03:18:06,690
Oh my gosh.

6710
03:18:06,790 --> 03:18:07,670
Here, you can clutch this.

6711
03:18:07,810 --> 03:18:08,450
How do I do it?

6712
03:18:08,550 --> 03:18:09,470
How do I do it?

6713
03:18:09,490 --> 03:18:09,990
How do I do it?

6714
03:18:10,090 --> 03:18:11,210
How do I do it?

6715
03:18:12,050 --> 03:18:12,930
Oh my gosh.

6716
03:18:12,930 --> 03:18:13,550
Oh my gosh.

6717
03:18:13,610 --> 03:18:13,790
Oh my gosh.

6718
03:18:13,870 --> 03:18:14,230
Oh my gosh.

6719
03:18:14,230 --> 03:18:14,470
Oh my gosh.

6720
03:18:14,770 --> 03:18:15,290
You're gaming.

6721
03:18:15,310 --> 03:18:15,770
You're gaming.

6722
03:18:15,770 --> 03:18:16,250
You're gaming.

6723
03:18:16,290 --> 03:18:16,850
Game of the year.

6724
03:18:16,930 --> 03:18:17,350
Game of the year.

6725
03:18:19,930 --> 03:18:21,710
Why do I always survive?

6726
03:18:23,310 --> 03:18:24,510
Did he just sigh?

6727
03:18:24,810 --> 03:18:25,490
Did he just go...

6728
03:18:26,710 --> 03:18:27,590
Oh my gosh.

6729
03:18:30,310 --> 03:18:30,750
600.

6730
03:18:31,070 --> 03:18:32,030
600, baby.

6731
03:18:32,110 --> 03:18:32,490
600.

6732
03:18:33,370 --> 03:18:33,810
600.

6733
03:18:34,050 --> 03:18:35,210
We're almost there.

6734
03:18:37,330 --> 03:18:38,210
Oh, brother.

6735
03:18:38,690 --> 03:18:39,130
Brother.

6736
03:18:39,190 --> 03:18:39,630
Brother.

6737
03:18:39,630 --> 03:18:39,970
Brother.

6738
03:18:39,970 --> 03:18:40,130
Okay.

6739
03:18:40,130 --> 03:18:41,190
It's the operation room.

6740
03:18:41,390 --> 03:18:41,710
Wow.

6741
03:18:41,790 --> 03:18:42,870
There's a lot going on in here.

6742
03:18:43,590 --> 03:18:44,370
Oh my gosh.

6743
03:18:44,430 --> 03:18:44,710
Okay.

6744
03:18:44,890 --> 03:18:46,130
There's a lot going on in here.

6745
03:18:46,570 --> 03:18:49,550
There's another X-ray over here that we can't go in.

6746
03:18:49,730 --> 03:18:50,050
Okay.

6747
03:18:50,110 --> 03:18:51,030
There's X-rays.

6748
03:18:51,330 --> 03:18:51,770
Okay.

6749
03:18:51,770 --> 03:18:52,650
There's a...

6750
03:18:52,650 --> 03:18:54,030
There's a calendar here.

6751
03:18:54,610 --> 03:18:55,250
There's a...

6752
03:18:55,250 --> 03:18:56,470
May, June, we care about your health.

6753
03:18:56,750 --> 03:18:57,150
Okay.

6754
03:18:57,190 --> 03:18:57,570
Nice.

6755
03:18:58,110 --> 03:18:58,510
Okay.

6756
03:18:58,530 --> 03:19:00,030
I think I absorbed everything in.

6757
03:19:01,070 --> 03:19:01,470
Okay.

6758
03:19:03,790 --> 03:19:04,490
There's a computer.

6759
03:19:04,550 --> 03:19:05,450
The screen is off.

6760
03:19:06,290 --> 03:19:07,330
Final stretch, baby.

6761
03:19:07,570 --> 03:19:07,930
Okay.

6762
03:19:07,930 --> 03:19:08,490
Let's just do it.

6763
03:19:08,490 --> 03:19:08,510
Let's just do it.

6764
03:19:08,510 --> 03:19:09,010
The final stretch.

6765
03:19:09,150 --> 03:19:09,850
Let's just do it.

6766
03:19:09,850 --> 03:19:10,550
We'll learn as we go.

6767
03:19:14,390 --> 03:19:16,690
That's how we did it in floor 500, baby.

6768
03:19:18,270 --> 03:19:20,590
Why can't this one be in the middle of the room?

6769
03:19:21,770 --> 03:19:21,930
I don't know.

6770
03:19:23,010 --> 03:19:23,670
All right.

6771
03:19:23,670 --> 03:19:23,990
All right.

6772
03:19:23,990 --> 03:19:24,350
Here we go.

6773
03:19:24,570 --> 03:19:25,310
Here we go.

6774
03:19:26,250 --> 03:19:26,690
Brother.

6775
03:19:27,570 --> 03:19:28,010
Brother.

6776
03:19:29,510 --> 03:19:30,770
All the screens are off.

6777
03:19:32,090 --> 03:19:32,530
Nothing.

6778
03:19:32,690 --> 03:19:33,890
No sixes anywhere.

6779
03:19:35,670 --> 03:19:37,410
I think it's no anomaly.

6780
03:19:37,650 --> 03:19:38,290
Oh my God.

6781
03:19:38,330 --> 03:19:39,510
Why am I glitching so bad?

6782
03:19:39,810 --> 03:19:41,810
I don't see any anomalies anywhere.

6783
03:19:42,070 --> 03:19:42,350
Oh yeah.

6784
03:19:42,370 --> 03:19:42,650
Me too.

6785
03:19:43,050 --> 03:19:43,610
Oh, whoa.

6786
03:19:43,810 --> 03:19:44,610
Is that a glitch?

6787
03:19:44,650 --> 03:19:44,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6788
03:19:45,010 --> 03:19:46,210
Or is that an anomaly?

6789
03:19:46,310 --> 03:19:47,450
I think... Is that an anomaly?

6790
03:19:47,750 --> 03:19:48,970
I think... Oh, oh.

6791
03:19:49,030 --> 03:19:51,130
I'm glitching so much even now.

6792
03:19:51,690 --> 03:19:52,010
Whoa.

6793
03:19:52,170 --> 03:19:52,690
Yeah, I think...

6794
03:19:52,690 --> 03:19:52,910
Whoa.

6795
03:19:53,470 --> 03:19:53,790
Whoa.

6796
03:19:54,330 --> 03:19:55,390
I think that's an anomaly.

6797
03:19:55,890 --> 03:19:56,870
Is that an anomaly?

6798
03:19:56,990 --> 03:19:57,350
Oh my God.

6799
03:19:57,430 --> 03:19:57,650
Whoa.

6800
03:19:58,090 --> 03:19:58,410
Yeah.

6801
03:19:58,530 --> 03:19:59,550
That has to be an anomaly.

6802
03:19:59,610 --> 03:20:00,170
There's no way.

6803
03:20:00,230 --> 03:20:01,150
There's no way, right?

6804
03:20:01,230 --> 03:20:01,910
There's no way.

6805
03:20:02,190 --> 03:20:02,470
There's no...

6806
03:20:02,470 --> 03:20:02,730
Well, fine.

6807
03:20:02,830 --> 03:20:03,730
I mean, we're in 601.

6808
03:20:03,930 --> 03:20:04,250
Yeah.

6809
03:20:04,290 --> 03:20:05,050
It doesn't matter.

6810
03:20:05,250 --> 03:20:06,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6811
03:20:07,730 --> 03:20:09,050
That has to be an anomaly.

6812
03:20:09,330 --> 03:20:09,930
That has to be.

6813
03:20:11,010 --> 03:20:11,330
Yay.

6814
03:20:11,950 --> 03:20:12,610
That was cool.

6815
03:20:12,770 --> 03:20:13,290
I like that one.

6816
03:20:13,290 --> 03:20:14,010
That was a cool anomaly.

6817
03:20:14,130 --> 03:20:14,270
Yeah.

6818
03:20:14,330 --> 03:20:15,390
I thought we were lagging.

6819
03:20:15,470 --> 03:20:15,890
Me too.

6820
03:20:15,970 --> 03:20:16,250
Whoa.

6821
03:20:16,250 --> 03:20:16,350
Whoa.

6822
03:20:16,390 --> 03:20:16,650
Whoa.

6823
03:20:16,650 --> 03:20:18,150
Brother scares me every time, man.

6824
03:20:20,030 --> 03:20:22,850
That was such a creative anomaly, though.

6825
03:20:22,950 --> 03:20:22,970
Yeah.

6826
03:20:22,970 --> 03:20:23,350
That one's fun.

6827
03:20:23,910 --> 03:20:24,350
Yeah.

6828
03:20:24,450 --> 03:20:26,650
Because you can't tell if it's kusoge or not.

6829
03:20:26,670 --> 03:20:27,110
Yeah.

6830
03:20:27,510 --> 03:20:30,470
It's like you are the game itself.

6831
03:20:31,270 --> 03:20:32,430
May, June, July.

6832
03:20:32,570 --> 03:20:33,890
We care about your health.

6833
03:20:34,050 --> 03:20:34,610
I'm looking up.

6834
03:20:34,610 --> 03:20:35,110
Disease history.

6835
03:20:36,290 --> 03:20:36,730
Nothing.

6836
03:20:37,250 --> 03:20:37,490
Nothing?

6837
03:20:37,710 --> 03:20:37,930
I don't see anything.

6838
03:20:38,230 --> 03:20:39,010
I don't see anything either.

6839
03:20:39,310 --> 03:20:40,850
I think we're actually good this time.

6840
03:20:41,750 --> 03:20:42,410
Here we go.

6841
03:20:42,530 --> 03:20:42,970
Anomaly.

6842
03:20:43,750 --> 03:20:44,930
Door on the wrong side.

6843
03:20:45,070 --> 03:20:45,290
No.

6844
03:20:45,430 --> 03:20:45,850
Oh.

6845
03:20:45,870 --> 03:20:45,970
Oh.

6846
03:20:45,970 --> 03:20:46,230
Oh.

6847
03:20:46,250 --> 03:20:46,670
The plant.

6848
03:20:46,670 --> 03:20:47,590
Don't fuck with us like that.

6849
03:20:48,050 --> 03:20:49,110
I'm checking now, though.

6850
03:20:49,110 --> 03:20:49,550
I'm checking.

6851
03:20:49,710 --> 03:20:50,090
I'm checking.

6852
03:20:50,250 --> 03:20:50,530
I'm checking.

6853
03:20:51,470 --> 03:20:51,990
All right.

6854
03:20:54,250 --> 03:20:54,650
603.

6855
03:20:54,670 --> 03:20:54,950
603.

6856
03:20:54,950 --> 03:20:55,230
And the labels.

6857
03:20:55,290 --> 03:20:55,550
Yeah.

6858
03:20:55,550 --> 03:20:57,650
We have to check the labels, too, just in case.

6859
03:20:57,650 --> 03:20:57,890
Yeah.

6860
03:20:57,890 --> 03:20:59,370
Just to see if there's any sixes.

6861
03:21:00,610 --> 03:21:01,010
Bing.

6862
03:21:01,610 --> 03:21:02,010
603.

6863
03:21:02,070 --> 03:21:02,390
Bing.

6864
03:21:02,830 --> 03:21:03,530
603, baby.

6865
03:21:04,490 --> 03:21:05,090
Let's go.

6866
03:21:05,550 --> 03:21:07,710
I think Brother's going to be standing at one point.

6867
03:21:07,790 --> 03:21:08,690
He's going to freak us out.

6868
03:21:08,770 --> 03:21:10,070
Or he's going to change his face.

6869
03:21:10,930 --> 03:21:11,330
Okay.

6870
03:21:11,390 --> 03:21:12,230
He's fine right now.

6871
03:21:12,930 --> 03:21:14,210
Nothing on the monitors.

6872
03:21:15,390 --> 03:21:15,790
Nothing.

6873
03:21:15,790 --> 03:21:16,410
Nothing on the side.

6874
03:21:16,810 --> 03:21:17,770
Nothing in the operating.

6875
03:21:19,010 --> 03:21:20,130
No 666 anywhere.

6876
03:21:20,890 --> 03:21:21,470
I'm checking.

6877
03:21:22,210 --> 03:21:23,430
We care about your health.

6878
03:21:23,510 --> 03:21:24,150
May, June, July.

6879
03:21:24,370 --> 03:21:25,130
It's the same date.

6880
03:21:25,450 --> 03:21:25,810
History.

6881
03:21:26,570 --> 03:21:28,490
There's no way that there's nothing here.

6882
03:21:29,410 --> 03:21:30,030
I don't know.

6883
03:21:30,050 --> 03:21:30,910
We could get two in a row.

6884
03:21:30,990 --> 03:21:31,610
No anomalies.

6885
03:21:31,870 --> 03:21:32,550
I guess so.

6886
03:21:32,610 --> 03:21:34,790
That's the secret one.

6887
03:21:34,870 --> 03:21:36,210
No anomalies for twice.

6888
03:21:37,030 --> 03:21:37,750
I don't think so.

6889
03:21:37,910 --> 03:21:38,210
All right.

6890
03:21:38,370 --> 03:21:38,590
Wait.

6891
03:21:38,650 --> 03:21:39,350
Did they not hear that?

6892
03:21:39,390 --> 03:21:39,790
Hear what?

6893
03:21:40,290 --> 03:21:40,830
Hear what?

6894
03:21:41,170 --> 03:21:41,950
Did you hear something?

6895
03:21:41,950 --> 03:21:42,570
They're fucking with you.

6896
03:21:42,610 --> 03:21:43,410
They're fucking with you.

6897
03:21:44,310 --> 03:21:45,170
There's no way.

6898
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:45,770
They're fucking with you.

6899
03:21:45,770 --> 03:21:47,710
What was that noise?

6900
03:21:48,190 --> 03:21:48,770
Wait, what do you mean?

6901
03:21:54,310 --> 03:21:55,370
I don't hear anything.

6902
03:21:55,790 --> 03:21:56,390
MBM, really?

6903
03:21:56,810 --> 03:21:57,590
Oh, that's you?

6904
03:21:58,290 --> 03:21:58,790
That's me.

6905
03:21:59,630 --> 03:22:00,970
Is that hole on the bed?

6906
03:22:01,490 --> 03:22:01,930
What?

6907
03:22:03,310 --> 03:22:04,590
There's always been a hole here.

6908
03:22:05,510 --> 03:22:06,130
What hole?

6909
03:22:06,310 --> 03:22:07,250
There's always been a hole there.

6910
03:22:07,730 --> 03:22:08,390
What hole?

6911
03:22:08,690 --> 03:22:09,030
What hole?

6912
03:22:09,750 --> 03:22:10,410
What hole?

6913
03:22:10,870 --> 03:22:11,530
This hole?

6914
03:22:11,790 --> 03:22:12,310
The oper...

6915
03:22:12,310 --> 03:22:13,190
Was that a girl?

6916
03:22:13,410 --> 03:22:13,710
What?

6917
03:22:13,810 --> 03:22:15,010
I'm scared now.

6918
03:22:16,770 --> 03:22:17,210
What?

6919
03:22:17,430 --> 03:22:18,210
That's always been a hole.

6920
03:22:18,210 --> 03:22:18,270
Oh, there's a hole.

6921
03:22:18,270 --> 03:22:19,230
There's a hole in this hole here, yeah.

6922
03:22:20,690 --> 03:22:22,030
It's always been there.

6923
03:22:23,370 --> 03:22:24,190
What do you mean?

6924
03:22:24,470 --> 03:22:24,790
Hold on.

6925
03:22:24,890 --> 03:22:25,050
Shh.

6926
03:22:29,100 --> 03:22:29,660
Wow.

6927
03:22:31,740 --> 03:22:32,780
Very realistic.

6928
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:37,620
Look, we've been playing for almost four hours.

6929
03:22:37,640 --> 03:22:39,660
I can't dedicate a voice for it.

6930
03:22:39,740 --> 03:22:40,140
Let's just go.

6931
03:22:40,140 --> 03:22:40,380
Okay.

6932
03:22:40,440 --> 03:22:40,860
Anyway.

6933
03:22:41,740 --> 03:22:42,500
All right.

6934
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:44,140
Up we go.

6935
03:22:44,640 --> 03:22:45,920
I mean, we're at 603.

6936
03:22:46,280 --> 03:22:47,240
There's no way.

6937
03:22:47,780 --> 03:22:49,760
At best, we retry three floors.

6938
03:22:49,860 --> 03:22:50,200
Okay.

6939
03:22:50,220 --> 03:22:50,640
We are so nervous here...

6940
03:22:50,860 --> 03:22:51,320
It's better than not.

6941
03:22:51,560 --> 03:22:51,860
It's better than not.

6942
03:22:51,940 --> 03:22:52,760
It's bigger than...

6943
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:56,340
Okay.

6944
03:22:59,300 --> 03:23:00,900
Let's see if there's a hole in the bed.

6945
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:01,700
Let's see.

6946
03:23:01,940 --> 03:23:03,580
There was no hole in the bed.

6947
03:23:03,960 --> 03:23:05,020
There's no hole on the bed.

6948
03:23:05,020 --> 03:23:06,260
There's no hole on the bed.

6949
03:23:06,820 --> 03:23:08,520
There's no hole on the bed.

6950
03:23:09,120 --> 03:23:10,940
We were like, there's always been a hole.

6951
03:23:10,960 --> 03:23:13,080
We were thinking of like, the fucking chiropractor.

6952
03:23:14,940 --> 03:23:16,820
I was like, are you massaging?

6953
03:23:18,160 --> 03:23:20,200
I figured out this is an operating room.

6954
03:23:29,440 --> 03:23:32,820
I thought it was there to keep your head comfy.

6955
03:23:33,100 --> 03:23:33,940
Me too.

6956
03:23:34,900 --> 03:23:36,300
Okay, well now we know.

6957
03:23:37,520 --> 03:23:38,620
Whoa, what's the game?

6958
03:23:39,020 --> 03:23:41,240
Oh, whoa, it's us.

6959
03:23:43,220 --> 03:23:43,980
Oh, it's you.

6960
03:23:44,040 --> 03:23:44,940
It's my POV.

6961
03:23:45,820 --> 03:23:47,160
It's your POV.

6962
03:23:47,160 --> 03:23:48,020
Alright, now we know.

6963
03:23:48,020 --> 03:23:48,480
Okay.

6964
03:23:48,680 --> 03:23:51,240
Guys, at least it was like three floors.

6965
03:23:52,400 --> 03:23:53,540
Yeah, it's fine.

6966
03:23:53,860 --> 03:23:54,660
Now we know.

6967
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:57,380
And then we call chat crazy.

6968
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:02,200
We're like, guys, there's always been a hole.

6969
03:24:02,580 --> 03:24:03,480
You're crazy.

6970
03:24:03,480 --> 03:24:04,540
I'm the protagonist.

6971
03:24:09,900 --> 03:24:12,600
They were like, literally, they were like, there's a hole there.

6972
03:24:12,680 --> 03:24:14,420
We're like, yeah, they're always asking.

6973
03:24:14,420 --> 03:24:16,240
We said it so confidently.

6974
03:24:16,540 --> 03:24:17,580
I know.

6975
03:24:18,380 --> 03:24:20,180
We were so like, yeah, duh.

6976
03:24:20,180 --> 03:24:21,040
Of course there's a hole.

6977
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:22,080
Oh my gosh.

6978
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:24,340
All operating tables have a hole in it.

6979
03:24:24,740 --> 03:24:25,140
Yeah.

6980
03:24:26,640 --> 03:24:27,660
May, June, July.

6981
03:24:28,100 --> 03:24:28,800
History, mm.

6982
03:24:28,940 --> 03:24:30,160
I don't think I see anything here.

6983
03:24:30,180 --> 03:24:30,800
History, mm.

6984
03:24:31,620 --> 03:24:32,760
Mystery, mm, is there.

6985
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:33,420
Brother.

6986
03:24:33,420 --> 03:24:34,140
There's no 666.

6987
03:24:34,500 --> 03:24:34,900
Brother.

6988
03:24:35,500 --> 03:24:37,800
We've been doing this for a while now, brother.

6989
03:24:38,140 --> 03:24:38,780
Brother, please.

6990
03:24:38,980 --> 03:24:39,380
Brother.

6991
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:40,680
Let us free.

6992
03:24:40,860 --> 03:24:41,400
Brother, uh.

6993
03:24:42,120 --> 03:24:42,880
Brother, uh.

6994
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:44,320
Brother, uh.

6995
03:24:44,320 --> 03:24:44,500
Brother, uh.

6996
03:24:46,740 --> 03:24:47,260
Brother, uh.

6997
03:24:47,260 --> 03:24:47,560
Brother, uh.

6998
03:24:49,540 --> 03:24:50,340
Come on.

6999
03:24:50,400 --> 03:24:50,880
Okay.

7000
03:24:51,020 --> 03:24:54,640
But like, also chat was gaslighting us while telling us there's a hole.

7001
03:24:54,640 --> 03:24:55,820
Yeah, they were saying, exactly.

7002
03:24:56,260 --> 03:24:56,600
Did you hear that?

7003
03:24:56,900 --> 03:24:58,800
Of course we're gonna think that.

7004
03:24:58,940 --> 03:24:59,060
Did you hear that?

7005
03:24:59,060 --> 03:25:00,880
We think that everything is wrong.

7006
03:25:01,160 --> 03:25:01,640
No, we didn't hear anything.

7007
03:25:03,240 --> 03:25:03,720
Um.

7008
03:25:04,620 --> 03:25:05,940
There's no sixes.

7009
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:06,620
Oh, look.

7010
03:25:07,560 --> 03:25:09,140
Is there anything on the other side?

7011
03:25:09,760 --> 03:25:10,240
No.

7012
03:25:10,260 --> 03:25:10,900
You care about your health.

7013
03:25:11,180 --> 03:25:11,860
You care about your health.

7014
03:25:11,860 --> 03:25:12,420
May, June, July.

7015
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:13,480
Um.

7016
03:25:13,620 --> 03:25:14,900
The labels are normal.

7017
03:25:15,440 --> 03:25:16,360
Labels are normal.

7018
03:25:16,420 --> 03:25:17,540
The x-rays are normal.

7019
03:25:18,760 --> 03:25:19,160
Uh.

7020
03:25:20,800 --> 03:25:23,460
There's no hole on the wall this time.

7021
03:25:23,660 --> 03:25:26,800
I thought I heard like a beeping, but it might have been like just ambience.

7022
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:27,220
Yeah.

7023
03:25:27,240 --> 03:25:28,040
I think it's ambience.

7024
03:25:28,100 --> 03:25:28,860
I didn't hear a beeping.

7025
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:29,260
Okay.

7026
03:25:29,320 --> 03:25:29,540
Okay.

7027
03:25:29,540 --> 03:25:30,520
We go to the other side.

7028
03:25:31,520 --> 03:25:31,920
Okay.

7029
03:25:32,660 --> 03:25:33,460
All right.

7030
03:25:34,200 --> 03:25:35,740
No, it's not your fault, chat.

7031
03:25:35,780 --> 03:25:36,800
The hole made a noise.

7032
03:25:38,020 --> 03:25:38,760
Oh, okay.

7033
03:25:38,880 --> 03:25:39,280
Yeah.

7034
03:25:39,380 --> 03:25:41,180
It wasn't your chat that pointed it out.

7035
03:25:41,400 --> 03:25:42,480
Or anything, you know.

7036
03:25:42,480 --> 03:25:43,880
And you chose to ignore it.

7037
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:45,520
You chose to ignore it.

7038
03:25:45,720 --> 03:25:46,840
You chose to ignore it.

7039
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:47,440
You chose to ignore it.

7040
03:25:47,440 --> 03:25:47,480
You chose to ignore it.

7041
03:25:47,480 --> 03:25:51,360
All your chat said was you hear the noise.

7042
03:25:53,020 --> 03:25:55,020
My chat actually called the hole in the bed.

7043
03:25:55,020 --> 03:25:58,940
They probably heard me like humming and were just like, uh-oh.

7044
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:00,540
That wasn't normal.

7045
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:02,140
Obvious.

7046
03:26:02,200 --> 03:26:02,620
It wasn't.

7047
03:26:02,640 --> 03:26:04,080
They were just trying to be helpful.

7048
03:26:04,420 --> 03:26:05,480
They were just trying to...

7049
03:26:07,620 --> 03:26:08,280
I don't...

7050
03:26:08,280 --> 03:26:08,480
What?

7051
03:26:09,260 --> 03:26:09,800
There's nothing.

7052
03:26:09,880 --> 03:26:10,500
I don't see anything.

7053
03:26:10,780 --> 03:26:11,340
I can't...

7054
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:11,620
Uh.

7055
03:26:11,780 --> 03:26:12,080
No.

7056
03:26:12,080 --> 03:26:13,160
Vitamin complex.

7057
03:26:13,240 --> 03:26:13,660
Yeah.

7058
03:26:13,660 --> 03:26:14,580
There's no 666.

7059
03:26:15,020 --> 03:26:16,320
We care about your health.

7060
03:26:16,500 --> 03:26:16,820
May, June, July.

7061
03:26:17,100 --> 03:26:17,460
May, June, July.

7062
03:26:17,460 --> 03:26:20,260
I'm looking to see if any heads pop up.

7063
03:26:21,160 --> 03:26:22,820
Door hinges are good.

7064
03:26:23,540 --> 03:26:24,020
Um.

7065
03:26:24,500 --> 03:26:24,840
Wait.

7066
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:25,940
See if there's lag.

7067
03:26:26,540 --> 03:26:27,160
Oh, yeah.

7068
03:26:27,380 --> 03:26:27,740
No.

7069
03:26:27,900 --> 03:26:28,440
No lag.

7070
03:26:28,560 --> 03:26:29,020
No lag.

7071
03:26:30,660 --> 03:26:31,460
So, here?

7072
03:26:31,580 --> 03:26:32,140
Is it none?

7073
03:26:32,620 --> 03:26:33,380
The floor.

7074
03:26:33,520 --> 03:26:34,360
What about the floor?

7075
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:36,800
What about the floor?

7076
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:37,480
No gas light.

7077
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:38,260
There's no gas light.

7078
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:40,980
Oh, my God.

7079
03:26:41,020 --> 03:26:43,120
The wires say 666.

7080
03:26:43,600 --> 03:26:44,080
666.

7081
03:26:45,540 --> 03:26:46,840
I saw it before you.

7082
03:26:46,940 --> 03:26:47,420
I saw it before you.

7083
03:26:47,420 --> 03:26:47,560
No.

7084
03:26:47,620 --> 03:26:48,120
I saw it.

7085
03:26:48,300 --> 03:26:49,000
I trust my chat.

7086
03:26:49,240 --> 03:26:50,460
I saw it in my chat.

7087
03:26:51,040 --> 03:26:51,560
That is...

7088
03:26:51,560 --> 03:26:53,500
I noticed that they were in perfect circles.

7089
03:26:53,500 --> 03:26:55,300
But I thought he just copied and pasted them.

7090
03:26:57,140 --> 03:26:59,200
I thought he was being a lazy dev.

7091
03:27:00,840 --> 03:27:02,260
After 600 floors?

7092
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:04,520
This is the part where he gets lazy?

7093
03:27:05,560 --> 03:27:06,460
Don't worry, Wisps.

7094
03:27:06,480 --> 03:27:07,440
I know you guys saw it first.

7095
03:27:08,200 --> 03:27:08,400
No.

7096
03:27:08,420 --> 03:27:09,080
Don't worry, Dragoons.

7097
03:27:09,160 --> 03:27:09,980
I knew you...

7098
03:27:09,980 --> 03:27:10,200
No.

7099
03:27:10,200 --> 03:27:10,300
No.

7100
03:27:10,300 --> 03:27:11,860
You guys are so good.

7101
03:27:12,080 --> 03:27:12,920
You guys are the best ever.

7102
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:14,160
I knew you guys were right.

7103
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:14,700
No.

7104
03:27:15,060 --> 03:27:17,240
Because I trust my chat.

7105
03:27:17,260 --> 03:27:17,400
I know.

7106
03:27:17,420 --> 03:27:17,820
Oh, my God.

7107
03:27:18,660 --> 03:27:19,420
Hole in the bed.

7108
03:27:19,840 --> 03:27:20,560
Hole in the bed.

7109
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:21,560
All right.

7110
03:27:21,560 --> 03:27:21,860
We know.

7111
03:27:21,940 --> 03:27:23,080
Hole in the bed is gone.

7112
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:23,820
Yeah.

7113
03:27:23,880 --> 03:27:24,800
Hole in the bed is gone, everybody.

7114
03:27:25,880 --> 03:27:27,540
We got hole in the bed out of the way.

7115
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:30,960
We were so fucking confident.

7116
03:27:32,180 --> 03:27:32,820
Oh, God.

7117
03:27:33,320 --> 03:27:34,580
We were like scolding our chat.

7118
03:27:34,640 --> 03:27:35,380
We were like, what?

7119
03:27:35,460 --> 03:27:36,140
There is no...

7120
03:27:36,140 --> 03:27:37,560
There is always hole in the bed.

7121
03:27:38,480 --> 03:27:38,800
606.

7122
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:39,520
Oh, my God.

7123
03:27:39,520 --> 03:27:40,000
That's 10 away.

7124
03:27:40,340 --> 03:27:40,980
I mean, wait.

7125
03:27:41,140 --> 03:27:41,800
Oh, my God.

7126
03:27:41,920 --> 03:27:42,240
Wait.

7127
03:27:42,320 --> 03:27:42,580
What?

7128
03:27:42,840 --> 03:27:45,280
I was going to say 10 away from 666.

7129
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:46,360
Yeah.

7130
03:27:46,360 --> 03:27:47,400
I was going to say that.

7131
03:27:47,920 --> 03:27:48,320
Wait.

7132
03:27:48,440 --> 03:27:48,780
Wait.

7133
03:27:48,800 --> 03:27:49,100
Look.

7134
03:27:49,160 --> 03:27:49,320
Look.

7135
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:49,700
Brother.

7136
03:27:49,900 --> 03:27:50,880
Brother is being polite.

7137
03:27:51,420 --> 03:27:52,120
Brother is...

7138
03:27:52,120 --> 03:27:52,320
Oh, my God.

7139
03:27:52,720 --> 03:27:53,120
Brother.

7140
03:27:53,360 --> 03:27:53,760
Brother?

7141
03:27:53,800 --> 03:27:54,140
Where is he?

7142
03:27:54,320 --> 03:27:56,800
Brother is talking to someone, I think.

7143
03:27:57,140 --> 03:27:57,800
Oh, brother.

7144
03:27:58,140 --> 03:27:58,540
Okay.

7145
03:27:58,680 --> 03:27:59,100
We're going.

7146
03:27:59,440 --> 03:27:59,840
Brother.

7147
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:00,580
Brother.

7148
03:28:00,580 --> 03:28:02,840
Brother has been in this hospital a bit too long.

7149
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:04,800
Brother finally is speaking.

7150
03:28:07,960 --> 03:28:08,620
It's okay, brother.

7151
03:28:08,840 --> 03:28:08,960
All right.

7152
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:09,340
Up we go.

7153
03:28:09,500 --> 03:28:11,020
He looks like really kind of...

7154
03:28:11,020 --> 03:28:11,840
He's slaying right now.

7155
03:28:11,880 --> 03:28:13,740
He was like flirty with whoever he was talking to.

7156
03:28:13,740 --> 03:28:13,760
Bro.

7157
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:14,740
Whoever he was talking to.

7158
03:28:14,820 --> 03:28:15,600
He was like, hey.

7159
03:28:15,900 --> 03:28:16,260
I know.

7160
03:28:18,040 --> 03:28:19,020
I like...

7161
03:28:19,020 --> 03:28:21,140
I want that anomaly again if we fuck up.

7162
03:28:22,220 --> 03:28:24,720
I can't wait to get flirty brother back.

7163
03:28:25,800 --> 03:28:27,640
I miss flirty brother.

7164
03:28:29,020 --> 03:28:31,520
There's Raiden in the operating room.

7165
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:33,380
Who the fuck is that?

7166
03:28:33,760 --> 03:28:34,360
I don't know.

7167
03:28:35,220 --> 03:28:37,740
I triple dog dare you to go see him.

7168
03:28:38,100 --> 03:28:38,660
Yeah.

7169
03:28:38,680 --> 03:28:39,220
Go up to him.

7170
03:28:39,560 --> 03:28:41,420
We got to do this again if we...

7171
03:28:41,420 --> 03:28:42,340
No.

7172
03:28:42,380 --> 03:28:43,220
Not necessarily.

7173
03:28:44,240 --> 03:28:44,800
Wait.

7174
03:28:44,820 --> 03:28:45,160
He just...

7175
03:28:45,160 --> 03:28:45,800
She's like...

7176
03:28:45,800 --> 03:28:46,180
How?

7177
03:28:46,180 --> 03:28:46,240
I don't know.

7178
03:28:46,240 --> 03:28:47,340
She's like half-clip to the floor.

7179
03:28:48,780 --> 03:28:49,980
What is she going to do?

7180
03:28:50,020 --> 03:28:51,120
Phase through and kill me?

7181
03:28:51,660 --> 03:28:52,360
She might.

7182
03:28:53,540 --> 03:28:54,320
I'm leaving.

7183
03:28:56,260 --> 03:28:57,940
What happened to moral support?

7184
03:28:58,500 --> 03:29:00,160
I never said that.

7185
03:29:00,680 --> 03:29:01,260
Oh.

7186
03:29:01,300 --> 03:29:03,920
Now you're not going to support me morally.

7187
03:29:05,200 --> 03:29:07,120
I've never supported you morally.

7188
03:29:10,180 --> 03:29:11,340
All right.

7189
03:29:11,660 --> 03:29:14,300
Raiden, turn off the game console.

7190
03:29:16,280 --> 03:29:16,800
608!

7191
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:18,600
We're getting there!

7192
03:29:26,600 --> 03:29:28,340
We're missing the monitor in the lab.

7193
03:29:28,480 --> 03:29:29,780
There's a baby in the...

7194
03:29:30,400 --> 03:29:31,420
There's a baby?

7195
03:29:31,560 --> 03:29:32,580
There's a baby in the...

7196
03:29:32,580 --> 03:29:33,280
There's a child.

7197
03:29:35,060 --> 03:29:36,180
Baby, you need help?

7198
03:29:36,940 --> 03:29:37,800
He's not moving.

7199
03:29:38,740 --> 03:29:39,780
Wait, what?

7200
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:42,460
He's counting, he's counting down.

7201
03:29:42,560 --> 03:29:43,060
He's counting down!

7202
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:46,720
93...

7203
03:29:48,220 --> 03:29:48,740
92...

7204
03:29:48,740 --> 03:29:48,920
92...

7205
03:29:48,920 --> 03:29:50,080
Why does he sound like that?

7206
03:29:50,080 --> 03:29:51,620
We have like 100 seconds.

7207
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:53,500
We have like 100 seconds!

7208
03:29:53,680 --> 03:29:55,080
Why does he sound like that though?

7209
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:56,520
95...

7210
03:29:56,520 --> 03:29:57,540
95...

7211
03:29:58,400 --> 03:29:58,920
94...

7212
03:29:58,920 --> 03:29:59,880
93...

7213
03:29:59,880 --> 03:30:01,780
Somebody put baby in the corner.

7214
03:30:03,440 --> 03:30:04,220
609, baby!

7215
03:30:05,120 --> 03:30:06,400
Well, hopefully there's no baby.

7216
03:30:07,640 --> 03:30:08,960
Alright, we got one baby.

7217
03:30:09,040 --> 03:30:10,280
Every floor has a baby.

7218
03:30:10,740 --> 03:30:11,220
No.

7219
03:30:13,020 --> 03:30:14,480
Nothing in the monitor.

7220
03:30:15,640 --> 03:30:17,380
Oh, I'm lagging, I'm lagging.

7221
03:30:17,700 --> 03:30:18,340
Are you?

7222
03:30:18,740 --> 03:30:18,920
I think so.

7223
03:30:19,640 --> 03:30:20,180
I'm not.

7224
03:30:20,560 --> 03:30:21,920
Oh, maybe my game is...

7225
03:30:21,920 --> 03:30:22,000
No, I'm not.

7226
03:30:22,060 --> 03:30:23,480
I think it's because I bumped into you, maybe.

7227
03:30:23,720 --> 03:30:24,060
Oh, maybe.

7228
03:30:24,640 --> 03:30:25,660
Yeah, I'm okay.

7229
03:30:25,720 --> 03:30:26,820
I'm walking back and forth.

7230
03:30:26,980 --> 03:30:27,480
Oh, okay, okay.

7231
03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:27,840
Never mind.

7232
03:30:28,900 --> 03:30:29,300
Um...

7233
03:30:30,180 --> 03:30:30,580
Kusoge.

7234
03:30:30,680 --> 03:30:31,400
Don't care about your health.

7235
03:30:31,420 --> 03:30:32,380
May, June, July.

7236
03:30:33,460 --> 03:30:34,840
Disease, history, mmm.

7237
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:37,060
I don't see anything.

7238
03:30:37,980 --> 03:30:39,660
I don't see anything either.

7239
03:30:41,280 --> 03:30:42,520
Nothing on the labels.

7240
03:30:42,800 --> 03:30:43,200
House kids.

7241
03:30:43,800 --> 03:30:45,600
All the labels are not 666.

7242
03:30:47,500 --> 03:30:47,900
Um...

7243
03:30:47,900 --> 03:30:48,720
I think we're fine.

7244
03:30:50,780 --> 03:30:52,460
Yay, we're at the closer door!

7245
03:30:54,400 --> 03:30:55,980
We're at the closer X-ray!

7246
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:57,340
I'm trusting you, I'm trusting you.

7247
03:30:59,000 --> 03:31:01,000
Okay, then you go back into the room, then.

7248
03:31:04,820 --> 03:31:05,580
I'm scared.

7249
03:31:05,580 --> 03:31:07,400
You go back into the room.

7250
03:31:08,260 --> 03:31:09,080
I'm scared.

7251
03:31:12,820 --> 03:31:16,100
You're going to trust me and you're not confident enough.

7252
03:31:16,400 --> 03:31:17,500
I'm scared.

7253
03:31:17,540 --> 03:31:18,080
I don't know.

7254
03:31:18,080 --> 03:31:18,660
I don't know, I'm nervous.

7255
03:31:19,340 --> 03:31:23,120
I feel like usually the things are... I don't know.

7256
03:31:25,020 --> 03:31:26,920
Okay, people are like, blood?

7257
03:31:27,260 --> 03:31:29,320
But they're not even confident about it.

7258
03:31:29,400 --> 03:31:31,140
They're saying like, is that blood by the brother?

7259
03:31:31,280 --> 03:31:32,700
But I don't see anything at all.

7260
03:31:32,960 --> 03:31:34,260
There's blood by the brother?

7261
03:31:34,540 --> 03:31:35,060
I don't think so.

7262
03:31:35,300 --> 03:31:35,800
I think they're...

7263
03:31:35,800 --> 03:31:37,720
They're being way too specific.

7264
03:31:39,320 --> 03:31:40,360
Yeah, there's blood.

7265
03:31:40,480 --> 03:31:40,720
What?

7266
03:31:40,800 --> 03:31:41,540
What are you talking about?

7267
03:31:41,620 --> 03:31:41,800
Where?

7268
03:31:42,720 --> 03:31:43,200
Where?

7269
03:31:43,740 --> 03:31:44,620
Behind the brother?

7270
03:31:46,420 --> 03:31:47,860
There's no blood anywhere.

7271
03:31:49,060 --> 03:31:51,880
Are we really on the cabinet door?

7272
03:31:52,760 --> 03:31:53,400
What?

7273
03:31:54,060 --> 03:31:54,700
What?

7274
03:31:56,100 --> 03:31:57,620
Okay, I'm pretty sure.

7275
03:31:57,980 --> 03:31:58,580
I'm so confused.

7276
03:31:58,840 --> 03:32:01,400
I am confused too.

7277
03:32:03,140 --> 03:32:04,220
I'm trying to see.

7278
03:32:04,520 --> 03:32:07,340
I'm trying to look around to see if we missed anything.

7279
03:32:08,480 --> 03:32:10,140
Blood inside you.

7280
03:32:10,520 --> 03:32:11,780
That's a medic bag.

7281
03:32:11,800 --> 03:32:12,280
I'm dead.

7282
03:32:13,340 --> 03:32:13,660
Okay.

7283
03:32:14,620 --> 03:32:15,500
Oh, a nectoplasm.

7284
03:32:15,520 --> 03:32:15,760
Yeah.

7285
03:32:15,900 --> 03:32:16,540
Get it right.

7286
03:32:16,760 --> 03:32:17,260
Okay, hopefully.

7287
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:18,900
Oh my god.

7288
03:32:19,320 --> 03:32:19,720
Okay.

7289
03:32:20,820 --> 03:32:22,620
I mean, if we get this right, it's 610.

7290
03:32:23,220 --> 03:32:23,620
Okay.

7291
03:32:23,860 --> 03:32:25,940
Let me just rip off the band-aid, man.

7292
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:27,180
Just rip off the band-aid.

7293
03:32:31,660 --> 03:32:32,260
Come on.

7294
03:32:34,060 --> 03:32:35,240
Oh my god.

7295
03:32:40,740 --> 03:32:41,760
What just happened?

7296
03:32:42,100 --> 03:32:42,460
Oh.

7297
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:43,100
Oh.

7298
03:32:43,360 --> 03:32:44,700
Hello, where are you?

7299
03:32:45,460 --> 03:32:46,200
Where are you?

7300
03:32:46,220 --> 03:32:47,220
I'm in exit 8!

7301
03:32:48,340 --> 03:32:49,000
No way.

7302
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:50,280
You're in exit 8?

7303
03:32:50,360 --> 03:32:51,680
Yes, I'm in exit 8!

7304
03:32:52,100 --> 03:32:53,260
You got teleported?

7305
03:32:53,260 --> 03:32:54,520
I want to get teleported.

7306
03:32:54,540 --> 03:32:55,520
I'm in exit 8 too.

7307
03:32:56,140 --> 03:32:56,580
Oh, hey.

7308
03:32:59,920 --> 03:33:00,660
No way.

7309
03:33:00,660 --> 03:33:01,300
Keep left?

7310
03:33:01,760 --> 03:33:02,440
Oh, shoot.

7311
03:33:02,500 --> 03:33:02,720
Wait.

7312
03:33:02,840 --> 03:33:05,480
Aren't we supposed to go backward if it's a...

7313
03:33:05,480 --> 03:33:06,600
Yeah, we go back.

7314
03:33:06,600 --> 03:33:07,260
We go backwards.

7315
03:33:07,400 --> 03:33:07,540
We go backwards.

7316
03:33:07,880 --> 03:33:08,100
It's an anomaly.

7317
03:33:08,280 --> 03:33:08,620
Yeah.

7318
03:33:08,620 --> 03:33:09,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7319
03:33:09,200 --> 03:33:09,700
Oh, there it is.

7320
03:33:09,720 --> 03:33:10,060
There it is.

7321
03:33:10,060 --> 03:33:10,440
There it is.

7322
03:33:10,900 --> 03:33:11,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7323
03:33:11,720 --> 03:33:12,160
There it is.

7324
03:33:13,060 --> 03:33:14,540
It's actually exit 8.

7325
03:33:14,540 --> 03:33:15,300
Oh my god.

7326
03:33:15,400 --> 03:33:17,620
We got easy guide to exit 8.

7327
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:18,680
Oh, we're back.

7328
03:33:20,280 --> 03:33:20,940
Wait, we're back?

7329
03:33:21,120 --> 03:33:21,720
Oh, we're back.

7330
03:33:21,940 --> 03:33:22,140
Okay.

7331
03:33:22,240 --> 03:33:23,900
I think that's an anomaly, guys.

7332
03:33:24,100 --> 03:33:24,940
I don't know about that one.

7333
03:33:26,300 --> 03:33:27,600
Is it the same dev?

7334
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:28,140
Or no?

7335
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:29,740
No, it's a different dev.

7336
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:30,880
It's a parody.

7337
03:33:31,080 --> 03:33:31,860
That's so funny.

7338
03:33:32,300 --> 03:33:33,340
That's so funny.

7339
03:33:33,360 --> 03:33:34,980
We got easy guide to exit 8.

7340
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:38,080
Some of these anomalies are pretty good, actually.

7341
03:33:38,220 --> 03:33:39,560
Yeah, they're actually pretty funny.

7342
03:33:41,180 --> 03:33:41,860
Oh, wait.

7343
03:33:41,960 --> 03:33:42,640
I think I'm lagging.

7344
03:33:42,720 --> 03:33:42,800
Is this a lag?

7345
03:33:42,940 --> 03:33:43,680
I think this is lag.

7346
03:33:43,860 --> 03:33:44,120
Yeah, yeah.

7347
03:33:44,160 --> 03:33:44,400
Wait.

7348
03:33:44,460 --> 03:33:44,740
Is it?

7349
03:33:45,880 --> 03:33:47,440
Unless we just pushed each other weird.

7350
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:48,220
Okay.

7351
03:33:48,360 --> 03:33:48,740
I'm going inside.

7352
03:33:48,900 --> 03:33:49,180
Oh, wait.

7353
03:33:49,180 --> 03:33:49,600
I'm lagging.

7354
03:33:49,620 --> 03:33:49,760
Wait.

7355
03:33:49,820 --> 03:33:50,140
No, no, no.

7356
03:33:50,240 --> 03:33:50,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7357
03:33:50,720 --> 03:33:51,120
It is.

7358
03:33:51,120 --> 03:33:51,300
It is.

7359
03:33:51,640 --> 03:33:52,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7360
03:33:52,540 --> 03:33:53,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7361
03:33:53,320 --> 03:33:53,600
That's...

7362
03:33:53,600 --> 03:33:53,800
Oh, whoa, whoa.

7363
03:33:53,980 --> 03:33:54,920
I'm trying to get out.

7364
03:33:54,980 --> 03:33:56,080
Let me out.

7365
03:33:56,280 --> 03:33:56,940
Let me out.

7366
03:33:56,980 --> 03:33:57,400
Let me out.

7367
03:33:57,420 --> 03:33:57,980
Let me out.

7368
03:33:59,180 --> 03:34:01,360
I see it pushing me so hard.

7369
03:34:05,160 --> 03:34:05,720
Oh, yes.

7370
03:34:08,020 --> 03:34:10,140
Oh, I still can't believe I teleported to exit 8.

7371
03:34:10,140 --> 03:34:10,360
I know.

7372
03:34:10,440 --> 03:34:11,000
That was crazy.

7373
03:34:11,440 --> 03:34:11,840
That was a good one.

7374
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:13,240
You didn't even want to join me.

7375
03:34:13,740 --> 03:34:14,540
I went in.

7376
03:34:14,700 --> 03:34:16,020
I went in.

7377
03:34:16,860 --> 03:34:17,460
Okay.

7378
03:34:18,520 --> 03:34:19,780
Is there any 666?

7379
03:34:20,080 --> 03:34:22,660
I'm not paranoid for any 666 references.

7380
03:34:23,300 --> 03:34:24,040
I know, right?

7381
03:34:24,220 --> 03:34:24,600
Oh, my God.

7382
03:34:24,980 --> 03:34:27,700
Ever since room 515.

7383
03:34:29,640 --> 03:34:31,460
I'll never forget 515.

7384
03:34:31,460 --> 03:34:32,020
I'll never forgive.

7385
03:34:32,260 --> 03:34:33,240
Never forget.

7386
03:34:33,240 --> 03:34:34,580
915, 516.

7387
03:34:34,820 --> 03:34:36,800
I'll never forget 516.

7388
03:34:36,920 --> 03:34:38,680
This one looks good, I think.

7389
03:34:39,400 --> 03:34:40,520
Yeah, I think so, too.

7390
03:34:41,520 --> 03:34:42,860
Anything behind the brother?

7391
03:34:43,400 --> 03:34:44,900
Just for chat's sake?

7392
03:34:44,900 --> 03:34:46,100
Where's the blood?

7393
03:34:47,140 --> 03:34:47,580
Okay.

7394
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:48,140
All right.

7395
03:34:48,280 --> 03:34:48,840
Seems fine.

7396
03:34:49,020 --> 03:34:49,040
I think we're good.

7397
03:34:49,200 --> 03:34:49,520
Yeah.

7398
03:34:50,060 --> 03:34:50,500
Yeah.

7399
03:34:51,260 --> 03:34:51,860
All right.

7400
03:34:51,880 --> 03:34:52,800
Heading to the other side.

7401
03:34:53,020 --> 03:34:54,860
No, we have to head to the other side.

7402
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:57,240
Doki checked the labels, right?

7403
03:34:57,280 --> 03:34:57,940
You checked the labels?

7404
03:35:00,300 --> 03:35:00,740
Sure.

7405
03:35:03,400 --> 03:35:04,960
Time to look at the numbers.

7406
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:05,720
Okay.

7407
03:35:06,000 --> 03:35:08,240
Time to look at the numbers.

7408
03:35:09,520 --> 03:35:11,000
Time to look at the...

7409
03:35:17,540 --> 03:35:18,060
All right.

7410
03:35:18,060 --> 03:35:18,560
This is your fault.

7411
03:35:18,700 --> 03:35:20,520
Oh, my goodness!

7412
03:35:20,740 --> 03:35:21,740
This is your fault.

7413
03:35:22,580 --> 03:35:24,300
This is your fault.

7414
03:35:24,440 --> 03:35:26,420
You said you checked.

7415
03:35:28,320 --> 03:35:29,260
We're reviewing.

7416
03:35:29,440 --> 03:35:29,960
We're reviewing.

7417
03:35:31,200 --> 03:35:33,240
Oh, my God.

7418
03:35:34,020 --> 03:35:35,480
We're not getting stucked.

7419
03:35:35,880 --> 03:35:37,560
We're not getting stuck here.

7420
03:35:37,680 --> 03:35:38,440
What was it?

7421
03:35:39,260 --> 03:35:39,780
Labels.

7422
03:35:40,200 --> 03:35:41,760
No, they're fine.

7423
03:35:41,860 --> 03:35:42,580
Is it the x-rays?

7424
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:44,940
Were they suppose to be closer to the metacars or not?

7425
03:35:44,940 --> 03:35:46,280
The calendar?

7426
03:35:46,640 --> 03:35:48,520
We care about your health.

7427
03:35:48,780 --> 03:35:49,540
I think that's what it says.

7428
03:35:50,140 --> 03:35:52,260
Is the x-ray supposed to be closer together?

7429
03:35:54,100 --> 03:35:55,100
What was it?

7430
03:35:55,160 --> 03:35:56,200
There's nothing up top.

7431
03:35:57,120 --> 03:35:58,100
What was it?

7432
03:35:58,120 --> 03:35:58,560
What was it?

7433
03:36:00,340 --> 03:36:01,180
Wait, actually?

7434
03:36:01,320 --> 03:36:02,140
The plugs?

7435
03:36:02,220 --> 03:36:02,400
Yeah.

7436
03:36:02,680 --> 03:36:04,300
Wait, what do you mean the plugs?

7437
03:36:08,220 --> 03:36:09,020
It's the walls.

7438
03:36:09,160 --> 03:36:09,700
It's the walls.

7439
03:36:10,360 --> 03:36:11,200
Oh my god!

7440
03:36:11,240 --> 03:36:11,980
I just saw them!

7441
03:36:12,640 --> 03:36:14,380
That is so cheeky!

7442
03:36:14,540 --> 03:36:15,560
Oh my god.

7443
03:36:16,940 --> 03:36:19,100
It doesn't appear until...

7444
03:36:21,020 --> 03:36:22,440
They're making it really obvious.

7445
03:36:23,680 --> 03:36:25,220
I can't believe we didn't see that.

7446
03:36:26,360 --> 03:36:27,920
Oh my god.

7447
03:36:31,980 --> 03:36:34,320
It's because they don't appear soon enough.

7448
03:36:34,520 --> 03:36:36,680
They don't appear soon enough, man.

7449
03:36:38,720 --> 03:36:39,760
Speedrunner's bane.

7450
03:36:40,660 --> 03:36:41,220
Zero.

7451
03:36:41,240 --> 03:36:41,880
This is zero.

7452
03:36:41,980 --> 03:36:43,200
Yeah, just keep going, keep going.

7453
03:36:43,260 --> 03:36:45,600
Give it up for the four hours!

7454
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:47,100
We're gonna make it!

7455
03:36:48,260 --> 03:36:50,400
God, you're actually right.

7456
03:36:50,560 --> 03:36:54,040
It's almost been four hours of this game!

7457
03:36:56,840 --> 03:36:59,360
Give it up for hour number four!

7458
03:37:02,420 --> 03:37:06,240
Okay, we got majority anomalies this time.

7459
03:37:06,380 --> 03:37:07,300
Yeah, it's true, it's true.

7460
03:37:07,460 --> 03:37:10,740
But we get to see Flirty Guy again.

7461
03:37:10,740 --> 03:37:11,960
Oh yeah, we got to see Flirty Boy again!

7462
03:37:11,960 --> 03:37:12,440
Flirty Brother again!

7463
03:37:12,640 --> 03:37:13,200
Flirty Brother.

7464
03:37:13,260 --> 03:37:14,240
I miss Flirty Brother.

7465
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:15,320
Yeah.

7466
03:37:15,520 --> 03:37:16,180
Wait, it's the same.

7467
03:37:16,340 --> 03:37:16,820
Maybe it's a win.

7468
03:37:17,100 --> 03:37:18,140
It's the walls, it's the walls.

7469
03:37:18,200 --> 03:37:18,840
Wait, is it the walls?

7470
03:37:19,180 --> 03:37:19,760
Are you sure?

7471
03:37:20,140 --> 03:37:20,780
Oh, you're right.

7472
03:37:20,820 --> 03:37:21,340
Yeah, it is.

7473
03:37:21,540 --> 03:37:22,360
Yeah, yeah, it's the walls.

7474
03:37:22,620 --> 03:37:23,140
Good, good, good.

7475
03:37:23,240 --> 03:37:24,100
We got it out of the way.

7476
03:37:24,100 --> 03:37:24,220
Oh my god.

7477
03:37:24,220 --> 03:37:24,760
We got it out of the way.

7478
03:37:24,820 --> 03:37:25,400
I got it out of the way.

7479
03:37:25,440 --> 03:37:25,860
Oh my god.

7480
03:37:25,860 --> 03:37:29,720
I was like, are my eyes deceiving me because we went through that?

7481
03:37:32,960 --> 03:37:34,060
Oh my god.

7482
03:37:34,080 --> 03:37:34,220
Oh my god.

7483
03:37:35,480 --> 03:37:40,260
In another world, it would have been like five floors left in another world.

7484
03:37:40,820 --> 03:37:41,140
Let's go.

7485
03:37:41,140 --> 03:37:43,500
This might be the first one last time too, right?

7486
03:37:44,300 --> 03:37:45,720
Anomaly, Anomaly, come over here.

7487
03:37:46,020 --> 03:37:46,800
Oh, I see it.

7488
03:37:46,980 --> 03:37:47,660
I saw it.

7489
03:37:47,700 --> 03:37:48,180
Then monitor.

7490
03:37:48,800 --> 03:37:49,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7491
03:37:50,220 --> 03:37:51,700
Hey, we get to do Exodate again!

7492
03:37:52,140 --> 03:37:52,640
Oh, yeah!

7493
03:37:52,800 --> 03:37:53,140
Yeah!

7494
03:37:53,520 --> 03:37:54,340
That was fun.

7495
03:37:54,900 --> 03:37:55,300
Yeah.

7496
03:37:55,580 --> 03:37:56,840
I wonder if it would be the same one.

7497
03:37:56,940 --> 03:37:59,200
The same Anomaly with the poster.

7498
03:37:59,500 --> 03:37:59,860
Oh, maybe.

7499
03:38:00,440 --> 03:38:01,200
Probably, right?

7500
03:38:01,400 --> 03:38:01,940
I think it's probably.

7501
03:38:01,940 --> 03:38:02,240
Yeah, probably.

7502
03:38:02,360 --> 03:38:04,120
Unless they coded like several.

7503
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:05,540
The one I don't want...

7504
03:38:05,540 --> 03:38:06,540
I don't like the lagging one.

7505
03:38:06,600 --> 03:38:07,300
It hurts my brain.

7506
03:38:07,720 --> 03:38:09,460
Oh, the lagging one was freaky.

7507
03:38:10,140 --> 03:38:11,120
There's no 666.

7508
03:38:11,140 --> 03:38:13,760
Because we're missing some Anomaly's that we haven't got.

7509
03:38:13,880 --> 03:38:14,840
Yeah, there's a few.

7510
03:38:15,880 --> 03:38:16,960
So like I'm worried.

7511
03:38:17,180 --> 03:38:18,320
But I think this one's okay.

7512
03:38:18,840 --> 03:38:18,860
I don't think so.

7513
03:38:18,860 --> 03:38:20,540
Yeah, I think this one's okay.

7514
03:38:20,860 --> 03:38:21,140
I think we're good.

7515
03:38:21,140 --> 03:38:21,520
I think we're good.

7516
03:38:21,600 --> 03:38:21,740
Yeah.

7517
03:38:22,140 --> 03:38:23,460
To the next floor!

7518
03:38:23,660 --> 03:38:25,540
To the next floor!

7519
03:38:25,580 --> 03:38:25,660
Next floor!

7520
03:38:36,800 --> 03:38:37,600
I won.

7521
03:38:40,040 --> 03:38:41,340
Oh, Discord lag.

7522
03:38:48,920 --> 03:38:51,320
I didn't realize this was a competition, but okay.

7523
03:38:51,460 --> 03:38:53,620
You held your note for a long time.

7524
03:38:53,640 --> 03:38:55,600
I assumed that we were trying to beat you.

7525
03:38:55,860 --> 03:38:59,360
I mean, that's what you would assume, isn't it?

7526
03:39:00,120 --> 03:39:02,800
No 666 on the floor, no baby.

7527
03:39:03,160 --> 03:39:05,280
No baby and nothing seems odd.

7528
03:39:06,100 --> 03:39:09,140
No hole in the bed.

7529
03:39:09,140 --> 03:39:11,340
Yeah, I think we're fine.

7530
03:39:11,560 --> 03:39:12,180
I think we're good.

7531
03:39:12,540 --> 03:39:13,400
Yeah, we're good.

7532
03:39:13,760 --> 03:39:14,420
Are we?

7533
03:39:14,700 --> 03:39:15,140
Yeah!

7534
03:39:17,520 --> 03:39:17,960
Ceiling?

7535
03:39:18,080 --> 03:39:19,000
What's wrong with the ceiling?

7536
03:39:19,440 --> 03:39:20,380
I'm checking the ceiling.

7537
03:39:20,380 --> 03:39:21,180
They always say ceiling.

7538
03:39:21,180 --> 03:39:21,900
I know, they really do.

7539
03:39:22,040 --> 03:39:22,460
They always say ceiling.

7540
03:39:22,740 --> 03:39:23,600
They always do.

7541
03:39:24,900 --> 03:39:26,700
They never stop with the ceiling.

7542
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:31,640
Alright, here we go.

7543
03:39:31,740 --> 03:39:32,240
Okay, here we go.

7544
03:39:32,540 --> 03:39:33,360
We're so close.

7545
03:39:33,400 --> 03:39:33,980
6-0-5!

7546
03:39:34,960 --> 03:39:36,600
Listen, more than 10 left.

7547
03:39:37,360 --> 03:39:38,220
11 left.

7548
03:39:38,440 --> 03:39:39,020
Go, go, go.

7549
03:39:39,140 --> 03:39:39,720
Go, go, go.

7550
03:39:39,820 --> 03:39:40,440
Go, brother.

7551
03:39:40,940 --> 03:39:41,580
It's fine.

7552
03:39:41,800 --> 03:39:42,040
Nothing.

7553
03:39:42,080 --> 03:39:42,640
No cables.

7554
03:39:44,340 --> 03:39:45,080
Everything's fine.

7555
03:39:45,420 --> 03:39:46,620
No sixes.

7556
03:39:46,780 --> 03:39:48,140
Oh, care about your health.

7557
03:39:48,880 --> 03:39:49,680
Labels are fine.

7558
03:39:50,440 --> 03:39:51,460
May, June, July.

7559
03:39:51,580 --> 03:39:52,320
No history.

7560
03:39:53,780 --> 03:39:54,480
Ceiling, nothing.

7561
03:39:54,840 --> 03:39:56,040
It says exit here.

7562
03:39:56,940 --> 03:39:57,780
I think we're good.

7563
03:39:57,860 --> 03:39:58,800
There's no hole in the wall.

7564
03:39:58,960 --> 03:39:59,380
Let's go.

7565
03:39:59,580 --> 03:39:59,880
Really?

7566
03:40:00,020 --> 03:40:00,920
Two in a row?

7567
03:40:01,300 --> 03:40:02,220
Two in a row.

7568
03:40:02,480 --> 03:40:04,200
The game's being nice to us.

7569
03:40:04,620 --> 03:40:05,240
Let's go.

7570
03:40:05,300 --> 03:40:05,900
Okay, okay, okay.

7571
03:40:06,300 --> 03:40:06,740
Alright.

7572
03:40:07,520 --> 03:40:09,000
I'm worried about the one thing.

7573
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:09,720
That's like...

7574
03:40:09,720 --> 03:40:12,200
Because we haven't seen three anomalies.

7575
03:40:12,320 --> 03:40:12,880
Yeah, I know.

7576
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:13,960
So it's like...

7577
03:40:13,960 --> 03:40:15,480
We don't know what to expect.

7578
03:40:16,360 --> 03:40:16,980
What to expect.

7579
03:40:16,980 --> 03:40:17,140
Come on.

7580
03:40:17,140 --> 03:40:17,900
6-0-6!

7581
03:40:18,660 --> 03:40:19,780
6-0-6!

7582
03:40:19,940 --> 03:40:20,220
Yes!

7583
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:24,100
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

7584
03:40:27,670 --> 03:40:28,110
It's...

7585
03:40:28,570 --> 03:40:29,550
Is that Steve Brother?

7586
03:40:29,770 --> 03:40:30,290
Wait, no.

7587
03:40:30,310 --> 03:40:30,630
Never mind.

7588
03:40:30,810 --> 03:40:30,910
No.

7589
03:40:31,350 --> 03:40:32,250
Oh, it's the monitor.

7590
03:40:32,350 --> 03:40:32,810
It's the monitor.

7591
03:40:33,090 --> 03:40:33,950
Oh, the monitor.

7592
03:40:34,010 --> 03:40:34,330
You're right.

7593
03:40:34,370 --> 03:40:34,670
Again?

7594
03:40:34,710 --> 03:40:36,010
Didn't we get the monitor before?

7595
03:40:36,710 --> 03:40:38,010
There's two different ones, right?

7596
03:40:38,510 --> 03:40:39,110
There was?

7597
03:40:39,330 --> 03:40:39,890
I think so.

7598
03:40:40,370 --> 03:40:41,110
Where did we go?

7599
03:40:41,110 --> 03:40:42,830
I thought we already did the brother.

7600
03:40:43,790 --> 03:40:44,510
I'm not the brother.

7601
03:40:44,530 --> 03:40:44,910
The monitor?

7602
03:40:44,990 --> 03:40:45,210
The monitor.

7603
03:40:45,510 --> 03:40:45,730
Yeah.

7604
03:40:45,870 --> 03:40:47,710
I thought we already did the monitor already.

7605
03:40:48,090 --> 03:40:49,270
It's your smoker baby.

7606
03:40:50,690 --> 03:40:52,250
I think the next one will be the baby.

7607
03:40:52,630 --> 03:40:53,410
Baby in the corner!

7608
03:40:53,430 --> 03:40:54,470
Baby in the corner!

7609
03:40:54,690 --> 03:40:55,470
Baby in the corner!

7610
03:40:55,630 --> 03:40:56,250
Baby in the corner!

7611
03:40:57,110 --> 03:40:57,470
Baby in the corner!

7612
03:40:57,470 --> 03:40:58,390
Baby, baby, baby.

7613
03:40:58,450 --> 03:40:59,770
Oh, apparently there is two.

7614
03:41:00,030 --> 03:41:00,390
Nice.

7615
03:41:00,470 --> 03:41:00,770
Okay.

7616
03:41:00,970 --> 03:41:01,150
Yeah.

7617
03:41:01,370 --> 03:41:03,050
Because I was like, I don't remember seeing two.

7618
03:41:03,330 --> 03:41:04,410
Oh, no baby in the corner.

7619
03:41:04,450 --> 03:41:04,890
It's the cable.

7620
03:41:05,010 --> 03:41:05,310
It's the cable.

7621
03:41:05,470 --> 03:41:06,430
Oh, 6-6-6.

7622
03:41:06,910 --> 03:41:07,550
6-6-6.

7623
03:41:07,570 --> 03:41:09,090
Why can't it be the closer elevator?

7624
03:41:09,290 --> 03:41:09,970
God damn it.

7625
03:41:11,110 --> 03:41:12,690
Give us a closer one.

7626
03:41:14,710 --> 03:41:15,150
Wow.

7627
03:41:15,290 --> 03:41:16,430
Someone's so slow today.

7628
03:41:16,650 --> 03:41:16,870
No.

7629
03:41:16,910 --> 03:41:19,630
I have a bug that's flying in my face.

7630
03:41:20,790 --> 03:41:21,590
Oh, no.

7631
03:41:22,290 --> 03:41:24,770
Does a bug know about 6-6-6?

7632
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:25,530
I killed it.

7633
03:41:25,930 --> 03:41:26,370
Oh.

7634
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:26,810
Whoa.

7635
03:41:26,910 --> 03:41:27,670
With your hand?

7636
03:41:27,810 --> 03:41:28,130
Yeah.

7637
03:41:28,150 --> 03:41:28,730
I thought it was a ghost.

7638
03:41:28,730 --> 03:41:29,630
I killed it just now.

7639
03:41:29,930 --> 03:41:30,910
Is it a ghost bug?

7640
03:41:32,170 --> 03:41:33,110
It is now.

7641
03:41:36,630 --> 03:41:37,470
Nothing here.

7642
03:41:37,870 --> 03:41:38,530
Oh, it's a lady.

7643
03:41:38,710 --> 03:41:39,430
It's Raiden.

7644
03:41:40,030 --> 03:41:40,470
Raiden.

7645
03:41:40,530 --> 03:41:40,950
Raiden.

7646
03:41:40,990 --> 03:41:41,090
Raiden.

7647
03:41:41,110 --> 03:41:41,350
Raiden.

7648
03:41:41,510 --> 03:41:41,730
Raiden.

7649
03:41:41,790 --> 03:41:42,890
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

7650
03:41:42,890 --> 03:41:44,210
Turn off the game console.

7651
03:41:47,170 --> 03:41:47,990
Oh, my God.

7652
03:41:48,290 --> 03:41:48,850
Oh, my God.

7653
03:41:48,890 --> 03:41:49,290
We're doing it.

7654
03:41:49,290 --> 03:41:49,710
We're doing it.

7655
03:41:49,710 --> 03:41:50,130
We're doing it.

7656
03:41:50,130 --> 03:41:50,570
We're doing it.

7657
03:41:50,570 --> 03:41:51,210
We're speed running.

7658
03:41:51,310 --> 03:41:52,190
We're so good now.

7659
03:41:52,510 --> 03:41:52,790
Woo.

7660
03:41:53,070 --> 03:41:53,390
Woo.

7661
03:41:56,610 --> 03:41:56,930
609.

7662
03:41:58,870 --> 03:41:59,250
It's okay.

7663
03:41:59,250 --> 03:41:59,690
Seven more.

7664
03:42:00,070 --> 03:42:00,650
Oh, my God.

7665
03:42:01,230 --> 03:42:02,410
Punching you so we get there faster.

7666
03:42:03,230 --> 03:42:03,870
Zesty brothers.

7667
03:42:03,970 --> 03:42:04,670
Zesty brothers.

7668
03:42:04,710 --> 03:42:05,190
Zesty brother.

7669
03:42:05,610 --> 03:42:05,930
Nope.

7670
03:42:06,290 --> 03:42:06,610
Baby.

7671
03:42:06,770 --> 03:42:06,990
Nope.

7672
03:42:07,190 --> 03:42:07,510
Nope.

7673
03:42:07,790 --> 03:42:08,530
Hole in the bed.

7674
03:42:08,590 --> 03:42:09,030
Hole in the bed.

7675
03:42:09,050 --> 03:42:09,490
Hole in the bed.

7676
03:42:09,490 --> 03:42:09,890
Hole in the bed.

7677
03:42:09,910 --> 03:42:10,290
Hole in the bed.

7678
03:42:10,290 --> 03:42:10,630
Ghost.

7679
03:42:10,770 --> 03:42:11,030
Ghost.

7680
03:42:11,330 --> 03:42:14,550
We punch each other to get us.

7681
03:42:14,950 --> 03:42:15,370
Help.

7682
03:42:15,570 --> 03:42:17,350
We need to get to 666.

7683
03:42:21,110 --> 03:42:22,930
We were like, okay, we found it.

7684
03:42:22,930 --> 03:42:23,630
Go, go, go.

7685
03:42:23,630 --> 03:42:24,610
Go, go, go, go.

7686
03:42:26,550 --> 03:42:27,070
Come on.

7687
03:42:27,230 --> 03:42:27,970
There we go.

7688
03:42:28,370 --> 03:42:32,290
I wonder if you failed the exit eight, do I lose?

7689
03:42:32,730 --> 03:42:33,510
I don't know.

7690
03:42:34,370 --> 03:42:35,530
Like before, right?

7691
03:42:35,950 --> 03:42:36,370
Yeah.

7692
03:42:36,390 --> 03:42:36,550
Yeah.

7693
03:42:36,550 --> 03:42:37,670
Because we got it right before.

7694
03:42:38,050 --> 03:42:38,730
We still have the lag.

7695
03:42:39,030 --> 03:42:39,410
Nope.

7696
03:42:39,430 --> 03:42:39,470
Nope.

7697
03:42:39,490 --> 03:42:39,590
Oh, baby.

7698
03:42:40,050 --> 03:42:40,530
Again.

7699
03:42:40,590 --> 03:42:41,030
The camera.

7700
03:42:41,230 --> 03:42:41,950
What the fuck?

7701
03:42:42,190 --> 03:42:43,130
Oh, I saw it.

7702
03:42:43,150 --> 03:42:43,510
I saw it.

7703
03:42:43,570 --> 03:42:43,870
Oh.

7704
03:42:44,090 --> 03:42:44,930
Oh, that's weird.

7705
03:42:45,010 --> 03:42:45,530
Oh, my God.

7706
03:42:45,610 --> 03:42:46,350
That's so weird.

7707
03:42:46,490 --> 03:42:49,370
That's like the camera, the dead POV.

7708
03:42:49,530 --> 03:42:49,970
Yeah.

7709
03:42:49,970 --> 03:42:50,330
Yeah.

7710
03:42:50,330 --> 03:42:50,590
Yeah.

7711
03:42:51,170 --> 03:42:52,010
That's kind of fun.

7712
03:42:52,410 --> 03:42:52,890
Yeah.

7713
03:42:52,930 --> 03:42:53,590
That's fun.

7714
03:42:53,910 --> 03:42:54,470
All right.

7715
03:42:55,110 --> 03:42:58,430
Someone needs to work out more there.

7716
03:42:58,430 --> 03:42:59,810
I was looking at it.

7717
03:42:59,970 --> 03:43:01,630
I was looking at it.

7718
03:43:02,170 --> 03:43:04,330
Do you not want to leave the hospital?

7719
03:43:06,170 --> 03:43:07,790
I'm enjoying my time.

7720
03:43:08,170 --> 03:43:09,390
It's literally a camera.

7721
03:43:09,390 --> 03:43:09,450
I'm enjoying my time.

7722
03:43:09,450 --> 03:43:09,570
I'm enjoying my camera.

7723
03:43:12,230 --> 03:43:12,890
Zesty Brothers.

7724
03:43:13,030 --> 03:43:13,430
Zesty Brothers.

7725
03:43:13,530 --> 03:43:13,950
Zesty Brothers.

7726
03:43:14,070 --> 03:43:14,470
Zesty Brothers.

7727
03:43:14,530 --> 03:43:14,610
Zesty Brothers.

7728
03:43:14,850 --> 03:43:15,350
Zesty Brothers.

7729
03:43:15,350 --> 03:43:15,510
Baby in the corner.

7730
03:43:15,570 --> 03:43:16,090
Maybe in the corner.

7731
03:43:16,550 --> 03:43:17,370
Maybe in the corner.

7732
03:43:17,530 --> 03:43:17,770
Nope.

7733
03:43:17,890 --> 03:43:18,550
Baby in the corner.

7734
03:43:19,070 --> 03:43:19,810
Maybe in the corner.

7735
03:43:19,890 --> 03:43:20,050
Baby in the corner.

7736
03:43:20,050 --> 03:43:21,050
Baby in the corner.

7737
03:43:21,150 --> 03:43:23,290
We just have Brother and Exodate.

7738
03:43:24,910 --> 03:43:26,150
That's all the ones we've seen.

7739
03:43:26,230 --> 03:43:26,510
Right?

7740
03:43:27,030 --> 03:43:27,370
Yeah.

7741
03:43:29,770 --> 03:43:30,110
.

7742
03:43:32,330 --> 03:43:33,010
Are you...

7743
03:43:36,490 --> 03:43:38,250
I was like, where did you go?

7744
03:43:38,410 --> 03:43:38,630
Oh.

7745
03:43:47,190 --> 03:43:48,950
What happens when he counts to zero?

7746
03:43:49,250 --> 03:43:50,170
That's what I'm wondering.

7747
03:43:50,530 --> 03:43:51,590
I'm really curious.

7748
03:43:54,390 --> 03:44:00,410
You want me in the elevator?

7749
03:44:00,750 --> 03:44:02,710
You want me in the elevator, Tokyo?

7750
03:44:03,150 --> 03:44:05,370
You want me in the elevator, Tokyo?

7751
03:44:05,370 --> 03:44:06,230
You want me...

7752
03:44:06,230 --> 03:44:08,350
No, no, go closer to that room!

7753
03:44:08,530 --> 03:44:09,210
Go closer!

7754
03:44:10,370 --> 03:44:11,010
What did...

7755
03:44:11,770 --> 03:44:12,390
What did he say?

7756
03:44:13,090 --> 03:44:13,790
Is he not...

7757
03:44:13,790 --> 03:44:14,130
What did he say?

7758
03:44:14,410 --> 03:44:15,370
He's not counting anymore.

7759
03:44:15,370 --> 03:44:15,890
Can you stop clowning?

7760
03:44:16,070 --> 03:44:17,630
I don't think he expects us to save you.

7761
03:44:17,630 --> 03:44:18,250
I don't think he does.

7762
03:44:19,690 --> 03:44:21,450
He got lazy!

7763
03:44:21,570 --> 03:44:22,410
I'm telling you!

7764
03:44:22,470 --> 03:44:23,110
Lazy Dev!

7765
03:44:23,230 --> 03:44:23,750
Lazy Dev!

7766
03:44:24,890 --> 03:44:28,390
He doesn't even fucking count all the way to the end!

7767
03:44:28,650 --> 03:44:30,030
You don't get count all the way to the end!

7768
03:44:30,050 --> 03:44:30,850
Start from ten!

7769
03:44:32,370 --> 03:44:33,390
I know, right?

7770
03:44:34,190 --> 03:44:35,350
The Dev got ten.

7771
03:44:35,370 --> 03:44:35,890
I'm tired.

7772
03:44:36,270 --> 03:44:38,290
He was like, well, you're supposed to be gone.

7773
03:44:38,510 --> 03:44:39,250
Oh, oh, oh.

7774
03:44:39,390 --> 03:44:39,750
Exit A?

7775
03:44:39,790 --> 03:44:40,830
Yeah, exit A, exit A.

7776
03:44:40,830 --> 03:44:42,170
Okay, I'm gonna see if you...

7777
03:44:43,250 --> 03:44:47,890
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7778
03:44:49,030 --> 03:44:49,390
What?

7779
03:44:49,390 --> 03:44:50,870
I wanna see you pop into existence.

7780
03:44:51,630 --> 03:44:52,890
Oh, okay, okay, I can do that.

7781
03:44:53,110 --> 03:44:53,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7782
03:44:53,830 --> 03:44:55,590
Oh my god, it's an anomaly!

7783
03:44:55,950 --> 03:44:56,770
I gotta go back!

7784
03:44:56,830 --> 03:44:57,210
Is it the same one?

7785
03:44:57,490 --> 03:44:58,290
Yeah, it's the same one.

7786
03:44:58,450 --> 03:44:59,050
Oh, okay.

7787
03:44:59,290 --> 03:45:01,210
Let's see what you look like when you pop back in.

7788
03:45:02,390 --> 03:45:03,090
Here I go.

7789
03:45:05,370 --> 03:45:05,710
Where are you?

7790
03:45:05,970 --> 03:45:06,650
I'm coming back.

7791
03:45:06,810 --> 03:45:07,510
Oh, I'm here.

7792
03:45:11,030 --> 03:45:11,830
It's this way.

7793
03:45:11,890 --> 03:45:12,450
Oh, it's this way.

7794
03:45:16,150 --> 03:45:17,370
He's popped inside.

7795
03:45:20,810 --> 03:45:21,930
Okay, up we go.

7796
03:45:22,850 --> 03:45:23,210
Three more!

7797
03:45:23,210 --> 03:45:23,710
Who are we missing?

7798
03:45:24,510 --> 03:45:27,290
Oh, we're missing Zesty Brother, and then I think two others, right?

7799
03:45:27,550 --> 03:45:28,470
Yeah, two others we haven't seen before.

7800
03:45:28,470 --> 03:45:28,710
Oh, and Lag.

7801
03:45:28,890 --> 03:45:29,990
I don't think we've gotten the Lag one yet.

7802
03:45:29,990 --> 03:45:31,170
Oh, we didn't ever get the Lag one.

7803
03:45:31,330 --> 03:45:34,530
Okay, so then what is... we have one anomaly that we haven't got before.

7804
03:45:35,650 --> 03:45:37,870
Okay, okay, okay, we got this, we got this.

7805
03:45:39,330 --> 03:45:41,330
Oh, what is this?

7806
03:45:41,330 --> 03:45:41,610
Is it the Lag?

7807
03:45:41,810 --> 03:45:43,090
No, no, no, look, look, look.

7808
03:45:43,870 --> 03:45:45,790
It's like unfinished textures.

7809
03:45:46,010 --> 03:45:46,570
No textures.

7810
03:45:46,790 --> 03:45:48,270
Oh, everything has no textures!

7811
03:45:48,670 --> 03:45:49,350
Oh my god!

7812
03:45:49,770 --> 03:45:52,910
Oh, so everything has to be an anomaly now.

7813
03:45:53,330 --> 03:45:54,230
Everything is a PNG.

7814
03:45:55,150 --> 03:45:55,730
No, no, no.

7815
03:45:56,270 --> 03:45:57,210
Okay, 14.

7816
03:45:57,350 --> 03:45:58,630
Oh wait, no, we're missing one.

7817
03:45:58,750 --> 03:46:00,270
No, I think it's better to... yeah.

7818
03:46:01,070 --> 03:46:02,510
We're missing one because we have...

7819
03:46:02,510 --> 03:46:03,930
We have to check.

7820
03:46:03,930 --> 03:46:04,090
We have one too?

7821
03:46:04,510 --> 03:46:05,590
Yeah, yeah, we have to check.

7822
03:46:05,810 --> 03:46:05,870
Oh, yeah.

7823
03:46:05,930 --> 03:46:06,530
Okay, it's fine.

7824
03:46:07,410 --> 03:46:08,030
Lazy Dev.

7825
03:46:11,910 --> 03:46:12,630
My immersion.

7826
03:46:12,930 --> 03:46:13,970
This isn't a video game.

7827
03:46:14,050 --> 03:46:14,670
This is real life.

7828
03:46:14,710 --> 03:46:15,450
I'm stuck in the game.

7829
03:46:15,530 --> 03:46:15,950
Please help.

7830
03:46:16,010 --> 03:46:16,910
We're stuck in a hospital.

7831
03:46:18,490 --> 03:46:19,130
Zesty Brother!

7832
03:46:19,290 --> 03:46:19,870
Zesty Brother!

7833
03:46:21,270 --> 03:46:22,510
He's having a good time.

7834
03:46:22,670 --> 03:46:23,190
Okay, nice.

7835
03:46:23,330 --> 03:46:25,870
Okay, Lag and then Unknown.

7836
03:46:28,010 --> 03:46:28,370
Yes.

7837
03:46:28,370 --> 03:46:29,610
All right, up we go.

7838
03:46:29,690 --> 03:46:31,530
We didn't take the wrong elevator too.

7839
03:46:31,610 --> 03:46:32,070
We did it.

7840
03:46:32,110 --> 03:46:32,770
We did it.

7841
03:46:32,770 --> 03:46:33,250
Okay, come on, come on.

7842
03:46:33,250 --> 03:46:34,170
We didn't take the wrong elevator.

7843
03:46:34,410 --> 03:46:34,670
We're good.

7844
03:46:34,730 --> 03:46:35,190
We got this.

7845
03:46:35,190 --> 03:46:35,550
We got this.

7846
03:46:35,570 --> 03:46:35,950
We got this.

7847
03:46:36,030 --> 03:46:36,270
We got this.

7848
03:46:36,330 --> 03:46:36,570
We got this.

7849
03:46:36,670 --> 03:46:39,250
This is the... how... how we can't fuck it up now?

7850
03:46:39,290 --> 03:46:40,490
It's gotta be the lag, right?

7851
03:46:40,790 --> 03:46:41,930
Yeah, it has to be the lag.

7852
03:46:41,950 --> 03:46:43,370
Or something else.

7853
03:46:44,130 --> 03:46:45,330
Or no anomaly.

7854
03:46:48,030 --> 03:46:51,470
Um, run around to see if we lag at all or...

7855
03:46:51,930 --> 03:46:52,570
No lag?

7856
03:46:52,990 --> 03:46:53,350
Um...

7857
03:46:53,350 --> 03:46:54,330
Oh, wait.

7858
03:46:54,430 --> 03:46:55,810
I don't like this because we don't...

7859
03:46:55,810 --> 03:46:56,330
We don't know.

7860
03:46:56,490 --> 03:46:57,050
We don't know.

7861
03:46:57,190 --> 03:46:57,870
We don't know.

7862
03:46:58,090 --> 03:46:58,610
We don't know.

7863
03:46:58,610 --> 03:46:58,990
We don't know.

7864
03:46:59,070 --> 03:46:59,430
Wait.

7865
03:46:59,690 --> 03:47:01,430
Wait, I don't like this because it's not lag.

7866
03:47:01,430 --> 03:47:01,450
I don't either.

7867
03:47:01,470 --> 03:47:02,750
It's too much of a mystery.

7868
03:47:03,570 --> 03:47:04,570
This is a mystery.

7869
03:47:05,370 --> 03:47:05,770
Labels.

7870
03:47:05,770 --> 03:47:06,950
The labels are fine.

7871
03:47:07,090 --> 03:47:07,950
I'm looking at the calendar.

7872
03:47:08,490 --> 03:47:08,890
Yeah.

7873
03:47:09,050 --> 03:47:10,050
Medical center first.

7874
03:47:10,130 --> 03:47:11,050
We care about your health.

7875
03:47:11,450 --> 03:47:12,390
May, June, July.

7876
03:47:12,490 --> 03:47:13,270
There's no 666.

7877
03:47:13,670 --> 03:47:14,030
Uh, no.

7878
03:47:14,110 --> 03:47:14,370
Oh, no.

7879
03:47:14,690 --> 03:47:16,350
Nothing with the table, the bed.

7880
03:47:17,250 --> 03:47:17,650
History.

7881
03:47:17,730 --> 03:47:18,450
Disease, history.

7882
03:47:18,610 --> 03:47:18,770
Hmm.

7883
03:47:19,050 --> 03:47:19,690
The x-rays.

7884
03:47:19,690 --> 03:47:20,390
There's no sixes.

7885
03:47:20,710 --> 03:47:22,070
Nothing with the x-rays.

7886
03:47:22,230 --> 03:47:23,390
They all look the same.

7887
03:47:23,670 --> 03:47:25,850
The walls aren't smiling this time.

7888
03:47:26,150 --> 03:47:26,370
No.

7889
03:47:26,950 --> 03:47:28,290
I don't like this myth.

7890
03:47:28,330 --> 03:47:28,830
I don't either.

7891
03:47:28,950 --> 03:47:29,810
I don't like this myth.

7892
03:47:29,810 --> 03:47:29,970
I don't like this.

7893
03:47:29,970 --> 03:47:30,770
Yeah, we got the wall.

7894
03:47:31,030 --> 03:47:32,450
The wall was the first one we got.

7895
03:47:32,450 --> 03:47:32,730
Yeah.

7896
03:47:32,750 --> 03:47:34,850
The x-rays are okay.

7897
03:47:35,110 --> 03:47:35,510
The ceiling.

7898
03:47:35,510 --> 03:47:36,230
Nothing on the ceiling.

7899
03:47:37,530 --> 03:47:38,130
I think.

7900
03:47:38,190 --> 03:47:38,570
Aww.

7901
03:47:38,950 --> 03:47:40,010
I don't know, man.

7902
03:47:40,010 --> 03:47:40,830
I don't know, man.

7903
03:47:40,830 --> 03:47:41,250
I don't know, man.

7904
03:47:41,250 --> 03:47:41,970
Does anyone know me?

7905
03:47:42,090 --> 03:47:42,830
I don't know, man.

7906
03:47:42,830 --> 03:47:43,670
I don't know, man.

7907
03:47:43,670 --> 03:47:44,330
I don't know.

7908
03:47:47,130 --> 03:47:48,110
I don't know.

7909
03:47:48,110 --> 03:47:49,390
I don't know about it.

7910
03:47:52,870 --> 03:47:53,310
I don't know about it.

7911
03:47:55,010 --> 03:47:55,810
I don't know about it.

7912
03:47:55,810 --> 03:47:56,390
I think we're good.

7913
03:47:56,950 --> 03:47:57,350
Okay.

7914
03:47:58,030 --> 03:47:58,430
Okay.

7915
03:47:58,710 --> 03:47:59,630
I'll press the button.

7916
03:47:59,670 --> 03:48:00,150
I'll take the...

7917
03:48:00,150 --> 03:48:00,510
Oh, okay.

7918
03:48:00,570 --> 03:48:01,390
You take the blade.

7919
03:48:01,430 --> 03:48:01,830
We pressed it.

7920
03:48:01,910 --> 03:48:02,390
Wait, what?

7921
03:48:04,750 --> 03:48:05,470
I've heard...

7922
03:48:10,830 --> 03:48:12,190
We don't have to do this!

7923
03:48:12,370 --> 03:48:14,430
I lagged.

7924
03:48:14,430 --> 03:48:14,830
I lagged.

7925
03:48:15,230 --> 03:48:16,770
I'm lagging in the elevator.

7926
03:48:18,850 --> 03:48:19,970
This is it!

7927
03:48:20,210 --> 03:48:20,630
This is it!

7928
03:48:20,910 --> 03:48:21,430
This is it!

7929
03:48:21,590 --> 03:48:22,310
Good luck, Mint.

7930
03:48:25,330 --> 03:48:27,450
We're at the... we're at the floor.

7931
03:48:27,550 --> 03:48:28,750
What floor are we at?

7932
03:48:29,470 --> 03:48:29,910
666!

7933
03:48:30,710 --> 03:48:31,270
We're here.

7934
03:48:31,430 --> 03:48:31,850
Here we go.

7935
03:48:32,810 --> 03:48:33,970
Just run for it.

7936
03:48:34,970 --> 03:48:35,590
Here we go.

7937
03:48:36,290 --> 03:48:37,810
Wait, the elevator's not open though.

7938
03:48:38,470 --> 03:48:38,790
Yeah.

7939
03:48:39,630 --> 03:48:40,030
Uh-oh.

7940
03:48:41,150 --> 03:48:41,470
Oh.

7941
03:48:41,970 --> 03:48:44,370
Oh, I think something is gonna come from that elevator.

7942
03:48:44,390 --> 03:48:45,610
Wait, no, but then like...

7943
03:48:45,610 --> 03:48:47,170
I think we need to turn around.

7944
03:48:47,330 --> 03:48:48,750
I think we need to turn around.

7945
03:48:48,910 --> 03:48:49,950
I think we need to turn around.

7946
03:48:50,010 --> 03:48:50,690
I think we need to...

7947
03:48:52,070 --> 03:48:52,810
What the hell?

7948
03:48:52,910 --> 03:48:53,610
Was that a PNG?

7949
03:48:54,090 --> 03:48:55,150
Yeah, that was a PNG.

7950
03:48:56,730 --> 03:48:57,970
I think we just gotta...

7951
03:48:57,970 --> 03:48:58,110
This way.

7952
03:48:58,230 --> 03:48:59,510
Oh, the sheet ghost!

7953
03:48:59,610 --> 03:49:00,190
The sheet ghost!

7954
03:49:00,350 --> 03:49:00,910
It's your cousin!

7955
03:49:01,110 --> 03:49:01,610
It's your cousin!

7956
03:49:01,610 --> 03:49:02,070
It's my cousin!

7957
03:49:02,350 --> 03:49:03,070
Just run!

7958
03:49:04,030 --> 03:49:04,490
Just run!

7959
03:49:04,730 --> 03:49:05,290
Oh, it's the body bag!

7960
03:49:05,570 --> 03:49:06,210
It's the body bag!

7961
03:49:06,630 --> 03:49:07,970
It's just a normal guy.

7962
03:49:08,190 --> 03:49:08,710
It's Anita!

7963
03:49:09,010 --> 03:49:09,910
It's a normal guy!

7964
03:49:10,250 --> 03:49:10,850
Oh my god!

7965
03:49:11,050 --> 03:49:11,730
It's a normal guy!

7966
03:49:13,770 --> 03:49:14,210
Oh my god.

7967
03:49:14,210 --> 03:49:14,290
No!

7968
03:49:15,910 --> 03:49:17,150
How did you die?

7969
03:49:17,250 --> 03:49:17,850
I don't know!

7970
03:49:18,410 --> 03:49:20,150
I think we have to like...

7971
03:49:20,150 --> 03:49:23,370
As soon as it starts ringing, we gotta... we gotta turn around.

7972
03:49:23,770 --> 03:49:24,750
Oh, that's true.

7973
03:49:24,990 --> 03:49:26,650
Wait, that means he's faster than us.

7974
03:49:26,730 --> 03:49:27,690
That's messed up!

7975
03:49:27,690 --> 03:49:28,130
Yeah, it's up there!

7976
03:49:28,670 --> 03:49:29,070
Okay.

7977
03:49:29,170 --> 03:49:29,750
There we go.

7978
03:49:29,810 --> 03:49:30,230
There we go.

7979
03:49:30,230 --> 03:49:30,750
Turn around, turn around.

7980
03:49:30,910 --> 03:49:31,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7981
03:49:31,190 --> 03:49:31,470
Turn around, turn around.

7982
03:49:31,470 --> 03:49:31,590
There we go.

7983
03:49:31,590 --> 03:49:32,190
Turn around, turn around.

7984
03:49:32,350 --> 03:49:33,250
We wasted too much time.

7985
03:49:33,250 --> 03:49:33,690
Oh, yeah.

7986
03:49:33,710 --> 03:49:34,070
We wasted too much time.

7987
03:49:34,070 --> 03:49:34,490
Go, go, go, go!

7988
03:49:34,730 --> 03:49:36,150
Let's go, don't stop!

7989
03:49:36,330 --> 03:49:37,350
Just don't stop!

7990
03:49:37,790 --> 03:49:38,470
Don't look back!

7991
03:49:38,470 --> 03:49:38,470
Don't look back!

7992
03:49:40,010 --> 03:49:41,510
I'll punch you through the tree!

7993
03:49:41,590 --> 03:49:42,170
I'll punch you!

7994
03:49:43,110 --> 03:49:44,790
I'll punch you if you get too close!

7995
03:49:44,970 --> 03:49:45,570
Okay, okay.

7996
03:49:45,650 --> 03:49:46,150
Punch me!

7997
03:49:46,230 --> 03:49:46,750
Punch me!

7998
03:49:46,790 --> 03:49:47,210
Punch me!

7999
03:49:47,330 --> 03:49:48,350
I'll punch you if you get too close!

8000
03:49:48,490 --> 03:49:49,110
Normal guy!

8001
03:49:49,310 --> 03:49:49,910
Normal guy!

8002
03:49:50,210 --> 03:49:50,690
Normal guy!

8003
03:49:50,790 --> 03:49:51,850
You're doing normal things!

8004
03:49:51,850 --> 03:49:52,210
Oh my god.

8005
03:49:52,730 --> 03:49:53,690
Are you punching me?

8006
03:49:53,810 --> 03:49:54,410
I'm punching you!

8007
03:49:54,510 --> 03:49:55,370
It's not working!

8008
03:49:55,910 --> 03:49:56,730
I'm punching you!

8009
03:49:56,750 --> 03:49:57,550
It's not working!

8010
03:49:58,250 --> 03:49:59,490
I'm doing my best!

8011
03:49:59,730 --> 03:50:00,470
Oh, it worked!

8012
03:50:00,470 --> 03:50:00,710
It worked!

8013
03:50:00,710 --> 03:50:00,970
It worked!

8014
03:50:00,970 --> 03:50:01,110
It worked!

8015
03:50:01,370 --> 03:50:02,730
I'm doing my best!

8016
03:50:02,730 --> 03:50:03,590
Don't die!

8017
03:50:03,630 --> 03:50:04,930
Don't die, doggy!

8018
03:50:05,090 --> 03:50:05,590
I'm gonna die!

8019
03:50:05,630 --> 03:50:06,190
I'm gonna do it!

8020
03:50:06,250 --> 03:50:07,030
I'm sacrificing my life!

8021
03:50:07,130 --> 03:50:07,730
I did everything!

8022
03:50:07,990 --> 03:50:08,310
Fuck off!

8023
03:50:09,150 --> 03:50:09,790
Oh my god.

8024
03:50:09,890 --> 03:50:10,350
I'm punching!

8025
03:50:12,450 --> 03:50:13,730
Oh my god, it's a doggy!

8026
03:50:13,730 --> 03:50:14,530
Oh my god, he was right there.

8027
03:50:14,570 --> 03:50:14,970
He was right there.

8028
03:50:15,070 --> 03:50:15,890
Oh my god.

8029
03:50:16,110 --> 03:50:16,850
He was right behind us.

8030
03:50:21,130 --> 03:50:23,190
Complete normal mode is what it said.

8031
03:50:23,450 --> 03:50:25,170
Oh my god, it was a doctor!

8032
03:50:26,330 --> 03:50:28,010
He wanted to get paid!

8033
03:50:29,610 --> 03:50:32,690
I like how this entire Critics is this one guy.

8034
03:50:32,730 --> 03:50:33,910
He's this one guy.

8035
03:50:34,130 --> 03:50:34,610
Marketing manager.

8036
03:50:34,790 --> 03:50:35,250
VTuber.

8037
03:50:35,510 --> 03:50:36,050
Sales manager.

8038
03:50:36,690 --> 03:50:37,150
Developer.

8039
03:50:37,750 --> 03:50:38,900
YouTube anomaly acting.

8040
03:50:40,810 --> 03:50:41,730
School 666!

8041
03:50:41,850 --> 03:50:42,650
School 666?

8042
03:50:43,590 --> 03:50:46,050
Oh, I know what we're playing next.

8043
03:50:46,890 --> 03:50:47,910
Oh my god.

8044
03:50:48,590 --> 03:50:50,550
Wait, are we going to classroom 666?

8045
03:50:50,590 --> 03:50:51,230
How are we gonna do it?

8046
03:50:51,310 --> 03:50:51,990
Is it gonna be floors?

8047
03:50:52,050 --> 03:50:53,470
Wasn't there an easy mode to this?

8048
03:50:53,750 --> 03:50:54,210
Like...

8049
03:50:54,210 --> 03:50:56,410
Yeah, the easy mode is that there's a routine.

8050
03:50:56,710 --> 03:50:57,170
So like...

8051
03:50:58,130 --> 03:50:58,590
Oh.

8052
03:50:58,750 --> 03:50:59,150
Wait.

8053
03:50:59,670 --> 03:51:00,130
What?

8054
03:51:00,270 --> 03:51:00,930
Wait, we're still here.

8055
03:51:01,890 --> 03:51:02,290
It said...

8056
03:51:02,290 --> 03:51:02,650
I got it.

8057
03:51:02,650 --> 03:51:02,710
I got it.

8058
03:51:02,710 --> 03:51:05,970
There was an achievement too that was just like you escaped the hospital, but have you really?

8059
03:51:06,590 --> 03:51:07,470
Is this hard mode?

8060
03:51:07,490 --> 03:51:07,910
There's more?

8061
03:51:08,170 --> 03:51:08,670
Oh my god.

8062
03:51:08,690 --> 03:51:09,850
The blood is like...

8063
03:51:10,370 --> 03:51:10,730
Yeah, but like...

8064
03:51:11,250 --> 03:51:11,970
But like...

8065
03:51:11,970 --> 03:51:12,530
Blood texture.

8066
03:51:12,550 --> 03:51:13,690
What is the hard...

8067
03:51:13,690 --> 03:51:14,110
What?

8068
03:51:15,110 --> 03:51:15,870
What's the difference?

8069
03:51:16,250 --> 03:51:17,010
I don't know.

8070
03:51:18,370 --> 03:51:19,530
What's the difference, Mint?

8071
03:51:19,690 --> 03:51:20,390
I don't know.

8072
03:51:20,450 --> 03:51:21,010
I don't know.

8073
03:51:21,190 --> 03:51:21,630
Is this...

8074
03:51:21,630 --> 03:51:22,210
Just keep going.

8075
03:51:22,310 --> 03:51:22,550
Is this...

8076
03:51:22,550 --> 03:51:23,490
Just go to the next...

8077
03:51:23,490 --> 03:51:24,190
Go to the elevator.

8078
03:51:24,430 --> 03:51:24,990
I thought...

8079
03:51:24,990 --> 03:51:25,550
It says exit.

8080
03:51:25,550 --> 03:51:26,370
I thought it was over.

8081
03:51:26,490 --> 03:51:26,930
It's fine.

8082
03:51:27,030 --> 03:51:27,790
Just keep going up.

8083
03:51:27,910 --> 03:51:28,530
I thought...

8084
03:51:28,530 --> 03:51:29,710
But it's back to zero.

8085
03:51:29,930 --> 03:51:30,290
No, no.

8086
03:51:30,410 --> 03:51:30,650
It's fine.

8087
03:51:30,650 --> 03:51:31,410
It's back to zero.

8088
03:51:31,410 --> 03:51:31,790
It's fine.

8089
03:51:31,910 --> 03:51:32,510
We're fine.

8090
03:51:32,910 --> 03:51:33,530
We're okay.

8091
03:51:33,790 --> 03:51:34,410
It's back to zero.

8092
03:51:34,410 --> 03:51:34,850
It's all good.

8093
03:51:35,010 --> 03:51:35,430
It's all good.

8094
03:51:36,330 --> 03:51:36,990
Oh no.

8095
03:51:38,930 --> 03:51:39,730
I don't understand.

8096
03:51:41,150 --> 03:51:42,250
What would be different?

8097
03:51:44,790 --> 03:51:46,110
I think the game is over.

8098
03:51:46,590 --> 03:51:47,870
I think the game is over too.

8099
03:51:48,010 --> 03:51:48,530
I think...

8100
03:51:48,530 --> 03:51:51,790
I think there's a return to menu button that we are allowed to play.

8101
03:51:51,790 --> 03:51:52,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8102
03:51:52,370 --> 03:51:52,650
I...

8103
03:51:52,650 --> 03:51:54,110
Yeah, I see it too.

8104
03:51:54,230 --> 03:51:54,710
I see it.

8105
03:51:54,810 --> 03:51:55,870
You see that menu?

8106
03:51:56,010 --> 03:51:56,490
Oh my god.

8107
03:51:56,530 --> 03:51:57,290
It just showed up.

8108
03:51:57,530 --> 03:51:58,350
I got it.

8109
03:51:58,430 --> 03:51:58,510
I got it.

8110
03:51:58,510 --> 03:52:01,410
I got into the elevator and the return to menu button showed up.

8111
03:52:01,450 --> 03:52:01,730
Oh my god.

8112
03:52:01,730 --> 03:52:02,050
Me too.

8113
03:52:02,190 --> 03:52:02,430
Yeah.

8114
03:52:02,530 --> 03:52:03,170
It just happened.

8115
03:52:03,610 --> 03:52:03,770
Yeah, yeah.

8116
03:52:03,770 --> 03:52:04,410
Yeah, yeah.

8117
03:52:04,490 --> 03:52:04,770
Oh my...

8118
03:52:04,770 --> 03:52:04,970
Wait.

8119
03:52:05,010 --> 03:52:05,670
I'm in the menu.

8120
03:52:06,090 --> 03:52:06,990
Oh, you left?

8121
03:52:07,110 --> 03:52:07,670
Oh my...

8122
03:52:07,670 --> 03:52:08,230
No.

8123
03:52:08,370 --> 03:52:09,530
It showed up.

8124
03:52:09,710 --> 03:52:10,810
She's gone, you guys.

8125
03:52:10,910 --> 03:52:11,370
She's gone.

8126
03:52:11,710 --> 03:52:13,050
I'm going to the next floor.

8127
03:52:13,550 --> 03:52:15,570
You're going to the next floor.

8128
03:52:15,950 --> 03:52:17,010
Are you actually?

8129
03:52:18,330 --> 03:52:20,370
There's like a giant handprint.

8130
03:52:20,690 --> 03:52:21,490
What are these?

8131
03:52:22,210 --> 03:52:22,650
Giant...

8132
03:52:22,650 --> 03:52:22,850
Oh.

8133
03:52:22,930 --> 03:52:23,550
What are you...

8134
03:52:23,550 --> 03:52:24,590
Is that you?

8135
03:52:24,950 --> 03:52:25,510
That's me.

8136
03:52:26,650 --> 03:52:27,390
That's the anomaly.

8137
03:52:28,650 --> 03:52:29,790
How did you do that?

8138
03:52:30,710 --> 03:52:31,030
Wait.

8139
03:52:31,170 --> 03:52:32,010
How did you do that?

8140
03:52:32,070 --> 03:52:32,970
You were over there.

8141
03:52:33,110 --> 03:52:33,430
Wait.

8142
03:52:33,430 --> 03:52:33,990
They're both orange.

8143
03:52:34,610 --> 03:52:35,670
They're both orange light.

8144
03:52:35,790 --> 03:52:36,650
Which is the OG.

8145
03:52:36,790 --> 03:52:37,190
No, they're not.

8146
03:52:37,250 --> 03:52:38,590
That one's only one that's orange.

8147
03:52:39,050 --> 03:52:40,170
That one's orange for me.

8148
03:52:40,870 --> 03:52:41,770
I think you fucked up.

8149
03:52:41,830 --> 03:52:41,850
They're both orange.

8150
03:52:41,930 --> 03:52:42,650
I think you messed up.

8151
03:52:42,670 --> 03:52:43,470
I think I fucked up the light.

8152
03:52:43,570 --> 03:52:43,750
Yeah.

8153
03:52:43,950 --> 03:52:45,010
I think you messed it up.

8154
03:52:45,670 --> 03:52:47,590
Everything is like light now.

8155
03:52:47,730 --> 03:52:48,370
It's so bright.

8156
03:52:48,610 --> 03:52:48,890
Is this...

8157
03:52:48,890 --> 03:52:50,130
This has to be the hard mode, right?

8158
03:52:50,210 --> 03:52:51,030
So let's go to the menu.

8159
03:52:51,470 --> 03:52:52,970
I'm going to go to the menu and see if it's unlocked.

8160
03:52:53,690 --> 03:52:54,790
It has to be the hard mode.

8161
03:52:54,970 --> 03:52:55,270
Okay.

8162
03:52:55,290 --> 03:52:55,490
I'm ready.

8163
03:52:55,490 --> 03:52:56,050
I'm returning to menu.

8164
03:52:56,050 --> 03:52:57,430
But, like, what's the hard mode, though?

8165
03:52:58,570 --> 03:52:59,090
Let's see.

8166
03:52:59,170 --> 03:52:59,650
New game.

8167
03:52:59,790 --> 03:53:00,130
Oh, yeah.

8168
03:53:00,170 --> 03:53:00,590
It's hell.

8169
03:53:00,990 --> 03:53:03,550
Return to floor 000 if you fail.

8170
03:53:04,470 --> 03:53:04,870
Oh.

8171
03:53:05,650 --> 03:53:06,470
It's the same.

8172
03:53:06,550 --> 03:53:08,210
It's just that you go back to zero.

8173
03:53:08,250 --> 03:53:08,470
Okay.

8174
03:53:08,490 --> 03:53:09,250
So we finished.

8175
03:53:09,370 --> 03:53:09,990
We beat the game.

8176
03:53:10,330 --> 03:53:10,770
Wait.

8177
03:53:10,790 --> 03:53:12,050
Is this actually...

8178
03:53:12,050 --> 03:53:13,170
But is it...

8179
03:53:13,170 --> 03:53:13,630
Hold on.

8180
03:53:13,630 --> 03:53:22,690
It basically, like, instead of returning back to, like, you know, instead of returning back to, like, floor 100, floor 200, floor 300, it goes back to zero.

8181
03:53:22,810 --> 03:53:23,070
Yeah.

8182
03:53:23,090 --> 03:53:24,770
But is it also different floors?

8183
03:53:25,030 --> 03:53:25,470
Yeah.

8184
03:53:25,490 --> 03:53:25,790
It's different floors, too.

8185
03:53:25,850 --> 03:53:26,430
I don't think so.

8186
03:53:26,630 --> 03:53:27,610
I'm starting a new game.

8187
03:53:28,030 --> 03:53:29,130
Are you fucking...

8188
03:53:30,070 --> 03:53:30,830
I'm curious.

8189
03:53:35,150 --> 03:53:36,410
Go some balls.

8190
03:53:38,210 --> 03:53:39,050
Is it bloody?

8191
03:53:39,370 --> 03:53:40,290
You have to host the game.

8192
03:53:40,390 --> 03:53:41,470
You have to host this.

8193
03:53:41,630 --> 03:53:41,790
No.

8194
03:53:41,890 --> 03:53:42,330
It's bloody.

8195
03:53:42,430 --> 03:53:42,690
It's bloody.

8196
03:53:42,830 --> 03:53:43,030
It's bloody.

8197
03:53:43,730 --> 03:53:44,390
So, yeah.

8198
03:53:44,510 --> 03:53:46,210
The hard mode is the bloody mode.

8199
03:53:46,450 --> 03:53:46,730
Yeah.

8200
03:53:46,830 --> 03:53:46,990
Okay.

8201
03:53:46,990 --> 03:53:47,210
Yeah.

8202
03:53:47,210 --> 03:53:47,410
Yeah.

8203
03:53:47,450 --> 03:53:48,330
I would assume it is.

8204
03:53:49,110 --> 03:53:49,990
We did it.

8205
03:53:50,270 --> 03:53:51,210
We did it.

8206
03:53:51,210 --> 03:53:52,370
We beat the game.

8207
03:53:53,270 --> 03:53:55,470
It only took us four hours.

8208
03:53:58,010 --> 03:53:59,430
What's the speedrun of this?

8209
03:53:59,710 --> 03:54:01,130
Speedrun.com.

8210
03:54:02,450 --> 03:54:02,930
Hospita...

8211
03:54:02,930 --> 03:54:05,270
It took us less than four hours.

8212
03:54:05,690 --> 03:54:06,230
Oh, you're right.

8213
03:54:06,310 --> 03:54:08,090
Because we had one hour to set up time.

8214
03:54:08,110 --> 03:54:08,490
Yeah.

8215
03:54:08,490 --> 03:54:09,810
One hour to set up time.

8216
03:54:09,910 --> 03:54:12,910
And also, it's not been four hours yet.

8217
03:54:13,170 --> 03:54:13,850
It's been...

8218
03:54:13,850 --> 03:54:14,490
Not yet.

8219
03:54:14,710 --> 03:54:16,790
It's been one week since we...

8220
03:54:16,790 --> 03:54:17,270
Wait.

8221
03:54:17,470 --> 03:54:18,310
Oh, my God.

8222
03:54:18,390 --> 03:54:19,510
We can be in the...

8223
03:54:19,510 --> 03:54:20,390
We can get in.

8224
03:54:20,570 --> 03:54:21,350
There's only...

8225
03:54:21,350 --> 03:54:23,790
We should submit our runs to speedrun.com.

8226
03:54:23,810 --> 03:54:24,910
There's only two participants.

8227
03:54:25,050 --> 03:54:25,470
Yeah.

8228
03:54:25,470 --> 03:54:26,990
No, we're gonna be at the leaderboards.

8229
03:54:27,230 --> 03:54:28,530
We're gonna be at the leaderboards.

8230
03:54:30,530 --> 03:54:31,990
First place is the creator.

8231
03:54:32,670 --> 03:54:33,070
Stop.

8232
03:54:33,390 --> 03:54:34,690
I think that's cheating.

8233
03:54:35,150 --> 03:54:36,470
That is actual cheating.

8234
03:54:39,590 --> 03:54:42,390
I like how first place is the creator.

8235
03:54:42,670 --> 03:54:43,230
How much is time?

8236
03:54:43,350 --> 03:54:43,870
What's his time?

8237
03:54:43,910 --> 03:54:44,310
What's his time?

8238
03:54:44,530 --> 03:54:45,350
30 minutes?

8239
03:54:45,610 --> 03:54:46,350
34 minutes?

8240
03:54:46,770 --> 03:54:46,810
No.

8241
03:54:47,150 --> 03:54:48,170
That's not fair.

8242
03:54:48,330 --> 03:54:49,550
It's not even fair.

8243
03:54:49,650 --> 03:54:49,950
Oh, my God.

8244
03:54:50,050 --> 03:54:50,650
It's not the creator.

8245
03:54:50,850 --> 03:54:52,010
It's some other guy.

8246
03:54:52,330 --> 03:54:52,930
I messed up.

8247
03:54:52,970 --> 03:54:53,630
It's not the creator.

8248
03:54:53,830 --> 03:54:55,450
I thought it was the creator, because I was wrong.

8249
03:54:55,470 --> 03:54:58,990
I saw Hong Kong, because I know that Dev is from Hong Kong.

8250
03:54:59,110 --> 03:54:59,790
But what if it's...

8251
03:54:59,790 --> 03:55:02,710
Maybe then it's a friend, and he fed the answers.

8252
03:55:02,710 --> 03:55:03,070
Oh, yeah.

8253
03:55:03,470 --> 03:55:04,310
You're right.

8254
03:55:04,410 --> 03:55:05,630
It was one month ago.

8255
03:55:05,630 --> 03:55:07,150
We could be the third and fourth place.

8256
03:55:07,330 --> 03:55:09,250
If I submit first, I get third place.

8257
03:55:09,430 --> 03:55:10,330
Oh, my God.

8258
03:55:10,350 --> 03:55:10,630
Doki.

8259
03:55:10,730 --> 03:55:15,850
The creator of that background just followed me on Twitter.

8260
03:55:16,050 --> 03:55:17,290
The laundry man.

8261
03:55:19,930 --> 03:55:20,810
Oh, my God.

8262
03:55:21,130 --> 03:55:23,630
Oh, my God.

8263
03:55:24,810 --> 03:55:25,450
Oh, my God.

8264
03:55:25,470 --> 03:55:27,330
I'm going to like the laundry man.

8265
03:55:27,690 --> 03:55:29,470
Go get the laundry man.

8266
03:55:29,810 --> 03:55:31,310
In fact, I'll follow them back.

8267
03:55:31,330 --> 03:55:33,170
You have to use the laundry man now.

8268
03:55:33,370 --> 03:55:34,270
You have to.

8269
03:55:37,110 --> 03:55:38,610
How did they know?

8270
03:55:38,910 --> 03:55:39,470
How did they know?

8271
03:55:40,030 --> 03:55:45,750
When will we get meaning that ghost girl at the laundry man role play?

8272
03:55:46,390 --> 03:55:46,950
ASMR.

8273
03:55:47,850 --> 03:55:49,610
I will get the laundry man.

8274
03:55:49,730 --> 03:55:51,470
I'll get the laundry man background, everybody.

8275
03:55:51,850 --> 03:55:52,990
Where will we get?

8276
03:55:53,730 --> 03:55:55,450
Laundromat ASMR RPGs.

8277
03:55:56,810 --> 03:55:57,910
I'm a maid.

8278
03:55:58,030 --> 03:55:59,750
I belong in the laundry room.

8279
03:56:02,010 --> 03:56:03,450
Oh, God.

8280
03:56:03,930 --> 03:56:06,050
Oh, I'm tired.

8281
03:56:06,630 --> 03:56:08,670
This was fun.

8282
03:56:09,090 --> 03:56:09,850
This was fun.

8283
03:56:10,330 --> 03:56:16,910
And it was a team effort with the wisps and the dragoons working together.

8284
03:56:17,230 --> 03:56:18,450
The wisp goons.

8285
03:56:18,570 --> 03:56:19,590
Team effort.

8286
03:56:19,850 --> 03:56:20,770
Team effort.

8287
03:56:20,850 --> 03:56:23,210
We all did this together, guys.

8288
03:56:23,210 --> 03:56:23,970
Good job, everybody.

8289
03:56:24,250 --> 03:56:24,790
Good job, team.

8290
03:56:24,790 --> 03:56:25,670
Good job, dragoons.

8291
03:56:25,670 --> 03:56:26,830
Give yourself a pat on the back.

8292
03:56:26,830 --> 03:56:27,550
Especially the dragoons.

8293
03:56:27,890 --> 03:56:28,450
Oh, especially.

8294
03:56:28,610 --> 03:56:30,930
The wisps helped, like, crazy, crazy amounts.

8295
03:56:31,170 --> 03:56:31,530
Yeah.

8296
03:56:31,650 --> 03:56:32,110
Yeah.

8297
03:56:32,230 --> 03:56:35,550
Even though, like, Mint didn't believe you sometimes.

8298
03:56:36,170 --> 03:56:37,850
Dragoons, like, the hole in the bed.

8299
03:56:38,990 --> 03:56:39,630
Oh, yeah.

8300
03:56:39,890 --> 03:56:40,570
You know.

8301
03:56:40,570 --> 03:56:43,990
But I know Doki, like, kind of doubts you guys all the time.

8302
03:56:44,010 --> 03:56:44,450
But it's okay.

8303
03:56:44,590 --> 03:56:45,010
It's okay.

8304
03:56:45,010 --> 03:56:45,830
No, wait.

8305
03:56:45,890 --> 03:56:46,830
I always believed.

8306
03:56:47,230 --> 03:56:48,170
I always...

8307
03:56:48,170 --> 03:56:48,870
Did you agree?

8308
03:56:53,230 --> 03:56:54,430
Good job, everybody.

8309
03:56:54,790 --> 03:56:55,490
Good job, guys.

8310
03:56:55,490 --> 03:56:56,450
Good job, every wisp.

8311
03:56:56,870 --> 03:56:58,870
Good job, every dragoon.

8312
03:56:58,970 --> 03:57:00,250
You guys did it.

8313
03:57:00,450 --> 03:57:01,670
Remember the time stamp.

8314
03:57:01,850 --> 03:57:03,930
Whoever gets the most correct, guys.

8315
03:57:04,730 --> 03:57:05,250
Okay.

8316
03:57:05,290 --> 03:57:07,130
Whoever gets the most correct, then what is it?

8317
03:57:07,190 --> 03:57:07,890
What do we get?

8318
03:57:08,150 --> 03:57:09,130
What do we have to do?

8319
03:57:10,650 --> 03:57:12,090
We have to...

8320
03:57:13,050 --> 03:57:14,070
What's the punishment?

8321
03:57:14,650 --> 03:57:15,030
Like...

8322
03:57:15,030 --> 03:57:16,130
I don't know.

8323
03:57:16,510 --> 03:57:17,030
Okay.

8324
03:57:17,110 --> 03:57:18,650
We decide the punishment later.

8325
03:57:18,830 --> 03:57:19,350
Oh.

8326
03:57:19,350 --> 03:57:19,610
Oh.

8327
03:57:19,710 --> 03:57:20,370
You decide.

8328
03:57:20,370 --> 03:57:21,390
You want to decide?

8329
03:57:21,510 --> 03:57:22,990
Only if you...

8330
03:57:23,870 --> 03:57:24,770
Only if you do it.

8331
03:57:24,770 --> 03:57:25,130
Oh.

8332
03:57:25,190 --> 03:57:25,510
Oh.

8333
03:57:25,570 --> 03:57:26,270
Are you not confident?

8334
03:57:26,410 --> 03:57:27,670
Are you not confident that you're going to win?

8335
03:57:27,770 --> 03:57:27,890
No.

8336
03:57:27,950 --> 03:57:28,750
I'm pretty confident.

8337
03:57:28,850 --> 03:57:29,530
I'm pretty confident.

8338
03:57:29,650 --> 03:57:30,150
I think I'm good.

8339
03:57:30,310 --> 03:57:30,790
You're pretty confident?

8340
03:57:31,030 --> 03:57:31,190
Yeah.

8341
03:57:31,410 --> 03:57:33,130
Why didn't you decide something right now then?

8342
03:57:33,190 --> 03:57:33,930
You're so confident.

8343
03:57:33,930 --> 03:57:36,050
You're the one who was just like, we'll decide later.

8344
03:57:36,930 --> 03:57:37,250
Yeah.

8345
03:57:37,310 --> 03:57:37,790
Because like...

8346
03:57:37,790 --> 03:57:38,590
Because we don't know.

8347
03:57:38,670 --> 03:57:39,570
We don't know the result.

8348
03:57:40,690 --> 03:57:42,670
If you're so confident, then figure out something now.

8349
03:57:43,610 --> 03:57:46,630
Loser has to use the other person's gamer sub's code.

8350
03:57:47,790 --> 03:57:48,110
Okay.

8351
03:57:49,450 --> 03:57:49,770
Deal.

8352
03:57:50,070 --> 03:57:50,390
Deal.

8353
03:57:50,450 --> 03:57:50,770
Deal.

8354
03:57:50,770 --> 03:57:50,890
Deal.

8355
03:57:53,950 --> 03:57:54,270
Deal.

8356
03:57:54,270 --> 03:57:54,350
Okay.

8357
03:57:54,350 --> 03:57:54,790
Let me grab...

8358
03:57:54,790 --> 03:57:56,450
Let me buy the free pack.

8359
03:57:59,250 --> 03:58:01,470
The free sample pack.

8360
03:58:04,630 --> 03:58:05,070
Oh.

8361
03:58:05,190 --> 03:58:05,630
No.

8362
03:58:07,950 --> 03:58:08,390
Oh.

8363
03:58:09,010 --> 03:58:09,810
GG's guys.

8364
03:58:09,910 --> 03:58:10,650
GG's everybody.

8365
03:58:10,990 --> 03:58:12,810
Are you going to chat with your wisp?

8366
03:58:12,870 --> 03:58:14,030
Because I'm just going to head off.

8367
03:58:14,210 --> 03:58:15,010
We did a long stream.

8368
03:58:15,010 --> 03:58:15,030
I think...

8369
03:58:15,030 --> 03:58:15,830
I'm trying just a little bit.

8370
03:58:15,930 --> 03:58:16,370
But yeah.

8371
03:58:16,410 --> 03:58:17,050
Not very much.

8372
03:58:17,150 --> 03:58:17,510
Okay.

8373
03:58:17,750 --> 03:58:18,030
Alright.

8374
03:58:18,890 --> 03:58:19,490
GG's man.

8375
03:58:20,030 --> 03:58:20,470
GG's.

8376
03:58:21,230 --> 03:58:21,670
GG's.

8377
03:58:22,670 --> 03:58:23,110
Bye.

8378
03:58:23,190 --> 03:58:23,630
Cool.

8379
03:58:23,810 --> 03:58:24,090
Bye.

8380
03:58:24,090 --> 03:58:24,250
Bye.

8381
03:58:24,270 --> 03:58:24,630
Bye.

8382
03:58:24,630 --> 03:58:24,890
Bye.

8383
03:58:25,050 --> 03:58:25,570
Bye.

8384
03:58:25,610 --> 03:58:25,750
Bye.

8385
03:58:26,230 --> 03:58:26,750
Bye.

8386
03:58:27,450 --> 03:58:27,970
Bye.

8387
03:58:28,210 --> 03:58:28,730
Bye.

8388
03:58:28,850 --> 03:58:29,050
Bye.

8389
03:58:31,860 --> 03:58:32,100
Bye.

8390
03:58:32,100 --> 03:58:32,220
Bye.

8391
03:58:32,940 --> 03:58:33,460
Bye.

8392
03:58:33,460 --> 03:58:33,560
Bye.

8393
03:58:33,560 --> 03:58:34,540
I just want to...

8394
03:58:34,540 --> 03:58:37,200
I just want to chill for a second before we...

8395
03:58:37,200 --> 03:58:38,700
Before we...

8396
03:58:38,700 --> 03:58:41,240
Before I leave you all.

8397
03:58:41,340 --> 03:58:45,120
I just want to chill for just a second.

8398
03:58:46,100 --> 03:58:47,980
Just a little bit.

8399
03:58:48,320 --> 03:58:48,840
Oh.

8400
03:58:48,940 --> 03:58:49,640
I'm missing.

8401
03:58:49,720 --> 03:58:50,200
Hold on.

8402
03:58:50,440 --> 03:58:51,500
Give me a second.

8403
03:58:59,430 --> 03:59:01,110
Let me put on some BGM.

8404
03:59:02,450 --> 03:59:03,430
Just for a second.

8405
03:59:04,410 --> 03:59:05,490
Just for a second.

8406
03:59:05,750 --> 03:59:06,630
Just for a second.

8407
03:59:08,030 --> 03:59:08,890
That was...

8408
03:59:08,890 --> 03:59:09,530
Oh my god.

8409
03:59:09,590 --> 03:59:10,950
My brain is mush.

8410
03:59:11,450 --> 03:59:12,170
Every day.

8411
03:59:12,570 --> 03:59:13,370
This week.

8412
03:59:13,470 --> 03:59:17,750
Every day my brain has become more mush as I continue onwards.

8413
03:59:18,690 --> 03:59:19,530
I think.

8414
03:59:20,210 --> 03:59:20,930
I think.

8415
03:59:23,350 --> 03:59:23,830
Oh.

8416
03:59:24,890 --> 03:59:25,370
Gosh.

8417
03:59:25,610 --> 03:59:26,030
Oh.

8418
03:59:26,070 --> 03:59:27,110
I don't know what song to put on.

8419
03:59:27,150 --> 03:59:27,510
Hold on.

8420
03:59:28,190 --> 03:59:28,670
Um.

8421
03:59:28,910 --> 03:59:29,390
Um.

8422
03:59:35,220 --> 03:59:37,340
Whisp goons are the real winners tonight.

8423
03:59:38,720 --> 03:59:40,520
I hope you guys enjoyed that.

8424
03:59:40,860 --> 03:59:43,240
Happy to report I have zero brain cells after that.

8425
03:59:43,340 --> 03:59:43,840
Me too.

8426
03:59:44,380 --> 03:59:48,440
I literally feel like my head is just like actually mush.

8427
03:59:49,340 --> 03:59:50,500
Oh my god.

8428
03:59:50,820 --> 03:59:51,820
That was fun though.

8429
03:59:52,720 --> 03:59:53,240
Thank you.

8430
03:59:53,400 --> 03:59:53,440

Thank you.

8433
03:59:59,140 --> 03:59:59,700
Thank you.

8434
04:00:00,420 --> 04:00:01,260
Thank you.

8435
04:00:01,980 --> 04:00:02,580
Thank you.

8436
04:00:09,940 --> 04:00:11,100
My throat hurts.

8437
04:00:11,860 --> 04:00:13,580
Thanks for lining up my week.

8438
04:00:13,760 --> 04:00:14,360
Thank you.

8439
04:00:14,460 --> 04:00:15,200
Thanks Virgil.

8440
04:00:15,500 --> 04:00:18,760
I hope you guys enjoyed that as an end to your week.

8441
04:00:19,220 --> 04:00:19,620
Um.

8442
04:00:19,700 --> 04:00:20,720
Happy Friday everyone.

8443
04:00:21,080 --> 04:00:21,380
Cobalt.

8444
04:00:21,460 --> 04:00:22,260
Thanks for the vibe gifted.

8445
04:00:22,500 --> 04:00:22,800
Thank you.

8446
04:00:22,840 --> 04:00:23,040
Thank you.

8447
04:00:23,440 --> 04:00:25,160
That thinking part is the problem.

8448
04:00:25,280 --> 04:00:26,180
You should try stopping.

8449
04:00:26,620 --> 04:00:27,520
Of course.

8450
04:00:27,640 --> 04:00:28,140
Of course.

8451
04:00:28,760 --> 04:00:29,280
Yeah.

8452
04:00:29,560 --> 04:00:29,840
Um.

8455
04:00:33,060 --> 04:00:35,180
Obvious answer here is never trust.

8456
04:00:35,180 --> 04:00:36,540
Doki's game choices.

8457
04:00:38,280 --> 04:00:38,800
Uh.

8458
04:00:39,880 --> 04:00:40,400

Tomorrow.

8464
04:00:46,960 --> 04:00:48,000
For Metal Gear.

8465

I will be playing up until um Doki's uh new skin suit reveals.

8466

But.

8469
04:00:58,560 --> 04:00:59,300
For now.

8470
04:00:59,440 --> 04:01:00,580
I'm gonna head out.

8471
04:01:01,200 --> 04:01:01,720

Ah.

8479
04:01:11,080 --> 04:01:11,500
So um.

Got my postcard in the mail today.

8491
04:01:28,360 --> 04:01:29,220
Before I.

8492
04:01:29,420 --> 04:01:31,640
They actually contacted me so long ago.

8493
04:01:32,040 --> 04:01:34,800
They were like do you want to become a gamer subs partner.

8494
04:01:34,980 --> 04:01:35,140
Uh.

8495
04:01:35,160 --> 04:01:36,340
And I was like.

8496
04:01:36,520 --> 04:01:36,800
Um.

8497
04:01:37,300 --> 04:01:38,000
Let me.

8498
04:01:38,060 --> 04:01:39,960
I've never had gamer subs before.

8499
04:01:40,140 --> 04:01:41,260
So like let me have it.

8500
04:01:41,580 --> 04:01:42,540
Before I.

8501
04:01:43,000 --> 04:01:43,900
Try it.

8502
04:01:44,020 --> 04:01:44,460
Because.

8503
04:01:44,740 --> 04:01:45,280
Um.

8504
04:01:45,280 --> 04:01:45,740
I've tried.

8505
04:01:45,880 --> 04:01:46,460
I've tried.

8506
04:01:46,940 --> 04:01:47,480
Um.

8507
04:01:47,500 --> 04:01:48,140
What's the word.

8508
04:01:49,140 --> 04:01:50,100
I've tried.

8509
04:01:50,940 --> 04:01:51,480
Uh.

8510
04:01:53,020 --> 04:01:53,860
Skip ads.

8511
04:01:54,040 --> 04:01:54,460
Shut up.

8512
04:01:54,520 --> 04:01:54,980
Shut up.

8513
04:01:54,980 --> 04:01:56,080
It's my first sponsor.

8514
04:01:56,120 --> 04:01:56,540
Please.

8515
04:01:59,800 --> 04:02:02,020
Let me have my first sponsor.

8516
04:02:02,040 --> 04:02:02,480
Please.

8517
04:02:03,360 --> 04:02:03,900
Um.

8518
04:02:03,920 --> 04:02:04,660
I've tried.

8519
04:02:04,660 --> 04:02:05,020
Like.

8520
04:02:05,160 --> 04:02:06,040
And I mean this.

8521
04:02:06,120 --> 04:02:06,620
Legitimately.

8522
04:02:06,700 --> 04:02:07,280
I've tried.

8523
04:02:07,300 --> 04:02:07,860
Like other.

8524
04:02:08,620 --> 04:02:09,460
What's the word.

8525
04:02:09,580 --> 04:02:09,920
Other.

8526
04:02:11,680 --> 04:02:12,040
Uh.

8527
04:02:12,360 --> 04:02:13,340
Those like other.

8528
04:02:13,480 --> 04:02:13,820
Like.

8529
04:02:13,980 --> 04:02:14,840
Gamer themed.

8530
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:15,540
Like.

8531
04:02:15,640 --> 04:02:16,460
Powdered drinks.

8532
04:02:16,800 --> 04:02:18,260
And the last one I had.

8533
04:02:18,680 --> 04:02:19,200
Which.

8534
04:02:19,300 --> 04:02:20,680
I never got a sponsorship for.

8535
04:02:20,740 --> 04:02:21,420
But I tried it.

8536
04:02:21,480 --> 04:02:21,780
Because.

8537
04:02:21,880 --> 04:02:22,140
Um.

8538
04:02:22,140 --> 04:02:23,500
A friend was sponsored by them.

8539
04:02:23,740 --> 04:02:24,480
And I.

8540
04:02:24,580 --> 04:02:25,160
Got it.

8541
04:02:25,500 --> 04:02:26,260
And like.

8542
04:02:26,580 --> 04:02:27,620
It was not.

8543
04:02:27,740 --> 04:02:29,240
I didn't like it at all.

8544
04:02:30,380 --> 04:02:32,360
It was so grainy.

8545
04:02:32,620 --> 04:02:33,600
And so bad.

8546
04:02:33,880 --> 04:02:34,800
But this one.

8547
04:02:35,260 --> 04:02:36,160
I actually liked.

8548
04:02:36,480 --> 04:02:37,120
So I was like.

8549
04:02:37,260 --> 04:02:37,400
Oh.

8550
04:02:37,560 --> 04:02:37,780
Well.

8551
04:02:37,900 --> 04:02:38,340
I don't mind.

8552
04:02:38,460 --> 04:02:38,780
Because.

8553
04:02:38,940 --> 04:02:40,060
I wanted to try it.

8554
04:02:40,100 --> 04:02:40,900
Before I was like.

8555
04:02:40,980 --> 04:02:42,340
I'm gonna promote it to you guys.

8556
04:02:42,960 --> 04:02:43,280
So.

8557
04:02:43,460 --> 04:02:43,920
You know.

8558
04:02:43,940 --> 04:02:45,400
I legitimately tried it.

8559
04:02:45,420 --> 04:02:46,140
Before I was like.

8560
04:02:46,500 --> 04:02:46,900
You know.

8561
04:02:46,920 --> 04:02:47,920
Because what if I tried it.

8562
04:02:47,960 --> 04:02:48,300
And I was like.

8563
04:02:48,360 --> 04:02:48,500
Ew.

8564
04:02:48,540 --> 04:02:49,160
This is so bad.

8565
04:02:51,740 --> 04:02:52,740
Powdered energy drink stuff.

8566
04:02:52,800 --> 04:02:53,360
Is hit or miss.

8567
04:02:53,480 --> 04:02:54,340
It can be very miss.

8568
04:02:54,460 --> 04:02:54,720
Yeah.

8569
04:02:55,400 --> 04:02:56,600
What flavor do you recommend?

8570
04:02:57,640 --> 04:02:57,960
Um.

8571
04:02:58,040 --> 04:02:59,440
I like mixing the mango.

8572
04:02:59,540 --> 04:03:00,300
And the raspberry.

8573
04:03:00,640 --> 04:03:01,500
But they are both.

8574
04:03:01,520 --> 04:03:02,460
Non-caffeinated.

8575
04:03:02,720 --> 04:03:02,980
So.

8576
04:03:03,680 --> 04:03:03,960
Mmm.

8577
04:03:05,340 --> 04:03:05,800
But um.

8578
04:03:05,820 --> 04:03:06,920
They sent me a ton of things.

8579
04:03:07,040 --> 04:03:07,400
They were like.

8580
04:03:07,500 --> 04:03:08,400
Which ones do you want to try?

8581
04:03:09,280 --> 04:03:09,560
So.

8582
04:03:09,660 --> 04:03:10,320
I got to try.

8583
04:03:10,400 --> 04:03:10,600
I got.

8584
04:03:10,620 --> 04:03:10,920
I was like.

8585
04:03:10,980 --> 04:03:11,040
Oh.

8586
04:03:11,080 --> 04:03:11,740
I want to try mango.

8587
04:03:11,860 --> 04:03:12,640
I want to try raspberry.

8588
04:03:12,760 --> 04:03:13,420
I want to try the.

8589
04:03:14,600 --> 04:03:15,160
Anime thighs.

8590
04:03:16,640 --> 04:03:16,920
And.

8591
04:03:17,080 --> 04:03:18,140
They sent me a bunch of like.

8592
04:03:18,240 --> 04:03:18,480
Their.

8593
04:03:18,720 --> 04:03:19,000
Um.

8594
04:03:19,160 --> 04:03:19,440
The.

8595
04:03:19,720 --> 04:03:20,000
The.

8596
04:03:20,220 --> 04:03:21,940
The nutritional bars too.

8597
04:03:22,060 --> 04:03:23,040
And some of the ramen.

8598
04:03:23,520 --> 04:03:24,900
But I haven't had any of the ramen.

8599
04:03:24,980 --> 04:03:25,460
It's all in my.

8600
04:03:25,520 --> 04:03:26,660
I keep looking over to the left.

8601
04:03:26,720 --> 04:03:27,840
Because it's all sitting there.

8602
04:03:27,900 --> 04:03:28,480
In a box.

8603
04:03:31,100 --> 04:03:31,380
Um.

8604
04:03:31,500 --> 04:03:31,940
But yeah.

8605
04:03:32,680 --> 04:03:32,960
Um.

8606
04:03:32,980 --> 04:03:33,880
But um.

8607
04:03:33,960 --> 04:03:34,360
I.

8608
04:03:34,380 --> 04:03:34,700
I.

8609
04:03:34,700 --> 04:03:34,800
So.

8610
04:03:35,260 --> 04:03:36,840
You can guarantee that.

8611
04:03:37,080 --> 04:03:39,240
I at least tried it before I'm.

8612
04:03:39,360 --> 04:03:41,040
Before I'm selling it to you guys.

8613
04:03:41,700 --> 04:03:43,240
And I do like the flavors.

8614
04:03:43,380 --> 04:03:44,040
I'm not going to.

8615
04:03:44,040 --> 04:03:46,120
I'm not going to try and sell something to you guys.

8616
04:03:46,180 --> 04:03:46,580
That.

8617
04:03:47,120 --> 04:03:47,900
I think is.

8618
04:03:48,080 --> 04:03:48,480
Shitty.

8619
04:03:48,620 --> 04:03:49,020
So.

8620
04:03:50,400 --> 04:03:50,800
Um.

8621
04:03:50,820 --> 04:03:52,520
I'm not going to just try and get my bag.

8622
04:03:52,740 --> 04:03:53,160
You know.

8623
04:03:53,260 --> 04:03:53,580
So.

8624
04:03:53,820 --> 04:03:54,860
Mint seal of approval.

8625
04:03:55,000 --> 04:03:55,680
Buy with confidence.

8626
04:03:55,940 --> 04:03:56,180
Yeah.

8627
04:03:57,500 --> 04:03:58,820
I will turn down something.

8628
04:03:58,980 --> 04:03:59,500
If I think.

8629
04:03:59,520 --> 04:03:59,960
I don't.

8630
04:03:59,980 --> 04:04:00,400
Like it.

8631
04:04:01,640 --> 04:04:02,040
Um.

8632
04:04:02,160 --> 04:04:02,260
Um.

8633
04:04:02,560 --> 04:04:02,960
Um.

8634
04:04:03,680 --> 04:04:04,040
So.

8635
04:04:04,700 --> 04:04:05,540
And I mean that.

8636
04:04:05,640 --> 04:04:06,260
For like.

8637
04:04:06,540 --> 04:04:07,080
I guess.

8638
04:04:07,400 --> 04:04:08,440
Any kind of sponsor.

8639
04:04:09,060 --> 04:04:09,420
Hmm.

8640
04:04:11,580 --> 04:04:12,800
I've already had all of it.

8641
04:04:12,840 --> 04:04:13,120
It's good.

8642
04:04:13,280 --> 04:04:13,620
Yeah.

8643
04:04:14,340 --> 04:04:15,160
I think so too.

8644
04:04:15,940 --> 04:04:16,700
I haven't tried.

8645
04:04:16,800 --> 04:04:17,100
I'll be honest.

8646
04:04:17,200 --> 04:04:17,560
I haven't tried.

8647
04:04:17,580 --> 04:04:19,020
They sent me the chocolate peanut.

8648
04:04:19,180 --> 04:04:19,980
Or the chocolate bars.

8649
04:04:20,180 --> 04:04:21,140
And the peanut butter bars.

8650
04:04:22,020 --> 04:04:22,380
Um.

8651
04:04:22,380 --> 04:04:22,560
Oh.

8652
04:04:22,620 --> 04:04:22,780
No.

8653
04:04:22,820 --> 04:04:23,760
I have had the peanut butter one.

8654
04:04:23,840 --> 04:04:24,080
I think.

8655
04:04:24,420 --> 04:04:25,560
I think it was kind of sweet.

8656
04:04:26,580 --> 04:04:27,520
Consume gamer subs.

8657
04:04:28,620 --> 04:04:29,760
Happy you got a sponsor.

8658
04:04:30,240 --> 04:04:30,860
Me too.

8659
04:04:31,480 --> 04:04:31,840
Happy you got a sponsor.

8660
04:04:32,600 --> 04:04:32,960
Happy you got a sponsor.

8661
04:04:32,960 --> 04:04:33,000
And.

8662
04:04:33,400 --> 04:04:35,140
I have more cool stuff on the way.

8663
04:04:35,160 --> 04:04:35,560
As well.

8664
04:04:37,940 --> 04:04:38,880
I had a meeting.

8665
04:04:39,060 --> 04:04:39,520
With um.

8666
04:04:39,880 --> 04:04:40,700
With a company.

8667
04:04:40,760 --> 04:04:41,060
Yesterday.

8668
04:04:41,520 --> 04:04:42,700
A Japanese company.

8669
04:04:42,920 --> 04:04:43,840
That reached out to me.

8670
04:04:45,000 --> 04:04:45,640
And um.

8671
04:04:46,120 --> 04:04:46,780
At first.

8672
04:04:46,800 --> 04:04:47,240
I was like.

8673
04:04:47,260 --> 04:04:47,600
Nervous.

8674
04:04:47,620 --> 04:04:48,060
I was like.

8675
04:04:48,160 --> 04:04:48,520
Should I.

8676
04:04:49,420 --> 04:04:50,160
I was like.

8677
04:04:50,220 --> 04:04:51,540
I don't feel confident enough.

8678
04:04:51,620 --> 04:04:52,100
In my Japanese.

8679
04:04:52,340 --> 04:04:52,660
To.

8680
04:04:53,040 --> 04:04:53,460
To.

8681
04:04:53,840 --> 04:04:55,040
To contact them.

8682
04:04:55,180 --> 04:04:55,600
But.

8683
04:04:55,680 --> 04:04:56,740
I hired a translator.

8684
04:04:56,900 --> 04:04:57,320
Actually.

8685
04:04:57,900 --> 04:04:58,540
And um.

8686
04:04:58,920 --> 04:04:59,340
So.

8687
04:04:59,400 --> 04:05:00,000
I had the meeting.

8688
04:05:00,060 --> 04:05:00,600
Last night.

8689
04:05:01,180 --> 04:05:01,820
And uh.

8690
04:05:01,820 --> 04:05:03,480
I hired the translator.

8691
04:05:03,580 --> 04:05:03,940
To help.

8692
04:05:04,360 --> 04:05:04,940
And um.

8693
04:05:06,040 --> 04:05:06,900
I asked them.

8694
04:05:06,960 --> 04:05:07,520
I was just like.

8695
04:05:07,800 --> 04:05:08,880
Have you worked with any.

8696
04:05:09,480 --> 04:05:10,660
Western Vtubers before?

8697
04:05:10,860 --> 04:05:11,320
And they were like.

8698
04:05:11,400 --> 04:05:11,540
No.

8699
04:05:11,840 --> 04:05:12,940
You would be the first.

8700
04:05:13,640 --> 04:05:14,040
So.

8701
04:05:15,500 --> 04:05:17,220
So I'm kind of excited about that.

8702
04:05:17,260 --> 04:05:17,540
Actually.

8703
04:05:17,600 --> 04:05:18,580
I've been drinking gamer subs.

8704
04:05:18,680 --> 04:05:18,920
For like.

8705
04:05:19,000 --> 04:05:19,620
Two weeks straight.

8706
04:05:19,660 --> 04:05:20,260
My blood is.

8707
04:05:20,620 --> 04:05:21,380
Gamer subs.

8708
04:05:22,400 --> 04:05:23,020
And now.

8709
04:05:23,040 --> 04:05:24,040
You can use my code.

8710
04:05:24,540 --> 04:05:24,800
Yippee.

8711
04:05:27,240 --> 04:05:27,940
So um.

8712
04:05:28,400 --> 04:05:28,800
Yeah.

8713
04:05:29,920 --> 04:05:31,080
There's some cool things.

8714
04:05:31,240 --> 04:05:31,640
Happening.

8715
04:05:31,640 --> 04:05:31,800
So um.

8716
04:05:31,800 --> 04:05:32,980
When are they releasing.

8717
04:05:33,040 --> 04:05:33,760
Minced thighs.

8718
04:05:33,880 --> 04:05:34,440
As a flavor?

8719
04:05:36,340 --> 04:05:37,840
If I ever get a flavor.

8720
04:05:39,160 --> 04:05:40,260
I already have an idea.

8721
04:05:40,560 --> 04:05:41,820
But I'm not going to tell you guys.

8722
04:05:42,060 --> 04:05:42,640
Not yet.

8723
04:05:42,760 --> 04:05:44,120
I don't know if I'm getting a flavor yet.

8724
04:05:44,340 --> 04:05:44,560
So.

8725
04:05:44,640 --> 04:05:44,920
Hmm.

8726
04:05:46,440 --> 04:05:46,840
So.

8727
04:05:49,640 --> 04:05:50,040
Um.

8728
04:05:50,200 --> 04:05:50,600
Yeah.

8729
04:05:52,740 --> 04:05:53,140
Okay.

8730
04:05:53,740 --> 04:05:54,320
But yeah.

8731
04:05:54,460 --> 04:05:54,860
So.

8732
04:05:55,080 --> 04:05:56,800
I am trying to plan stuff.

8733
04:05:57,420 --> 04:05:58,360
I am trying to.

8734
04:05:58,420 --> 04:05:58,940
Do stuff.

8735
04:06:00,040 --> 04:06:01,320
It's just a little slower.

8736
04:06:01,460 --> 04:06:01,660
Because it's so slow.

8737
04:06:01,660 --> 04:06:01,780
Because it's so slow.

8738
04:06:01,780 --> 04:06:02,220
It's just me.

8739
04:06:04,460 --> 04:06:05,320
You're pretty good.

8740
04:06:05,400 --> 04:06:06,620
At this whole Vtuber thing.

8741
04:06:06,820 --> 04:06:07,320
I'm trying.

8742
04:06:09,060 --> 04:06:09,740
It's hard.

8743
04:06:10,760 --> 04:06:11,160
But.

8744
04:06:12,400 --> 04:06:12,940
You know.

8745
04:06:14,280 --> 04:06:15,800
Did you tell the Japanese company.

8746
04:06:15,960 --> 04:06:16,640
To use code.

8747
04:06:16,700 --> 04:06:17,080
Boomer.

8748
04:06:18,180 --> 04:06:18,580
Stop.

8749
04:06:22,840 --> 04:06:24,300
Stop trying to guess my.

8750
04:06:24,500 --> 04:06:24,780
I think.

8751
04:06:24,860 --> 04:06:25,180
Actually.

8752
04:06:25,260 --> 04:06:26,240
I don't think any of you.

8753
04:06:26,240 --> 04:06:27,060
Would guess my flavor.

8754
04:06:27,360 --> 04:06:28,060
That I want.

8755
04:06:28,200 --> 04:06:28,620
At least.

8756
04:06:28,800 --> 04:06:29,900
I drink multiple bottles.

8757
04:06:30,040 --> 04:06:30,760
Of the red raspberry.

8758
04:06:30,880 --> 04:06:31,260
Per night.

8759
04:06:31,400 --> 04:06:31,760
Every night.

8760
04:06:31,780 --> 04:06:32,600
It's a problem.

8761
04:06:32,860 --> 04:06:33,420
They actually.

8762
04:06:33,460 --> 04:06:34,120
They have like.

8763
04:06:34,200 --> 04:06:34,720
New ones.

8764
04:06:34,800 --> 04:06:35,540
That are kind of like.

8765
04:06:36,460 --> 04:06:37,220
I think.

8766
04:06:37,240 --> 04:06:37,740
I don't think.

8767
04:06:37,820 --> 04:06:37,980
They.

8768
04:06:38,000 --> 04:06:39,580
It says they have no melatonin.

8769
04:06:39,600 --> 04:06:40,680
But it's supposed to help you.

8770
04:06:41,600 --> 04:06:42,940
It's supposed to help you sleep.

8771
04:06:43,100 --> 04:06:43,400
So.

8772
04:06:43,420 --> 04:06:43,800
I don't know.

8773
04:06:45,780 --> 04:06:46,880
Maybe I'll try it.

8774
04:06:48,580 --> 04:06:49,420
Bulba flavor.

8775
04:06:50,160 --> 04:06:50,600
Bulberry.

8776
04:06:50,960 --> 04:06:51,360
Actually.

8777
04:06:51,420 --> 04:06:51,980
That's so cute.

8778
04:06:52,580 --> 04:06:53,440
Corn soup.

8779
04:06:53,540 --> 04:06:54,400
Energy drink.

8780
04:06:54,900 --> 04:06:56,380
That's what the world needs.

8781
04:06:56,460 --> 04:06:57,220
A corn soup.

8782
04:06:57,240 --> 04:06:57,660
Flavored.

8783
04:06:57,700 --> 04:06:58,440
Energy drink.

8784
04:07:00,340 --> 04:07:01,000
Mince flavor.

8785
04:07:01,220 --> 04:07:01,760
Ecto corn.

8786
04:07:01,780 --> 04:07:02,160
Cooler.

8787
04:07:02,260 --> 04:07:02,900
Pretend the hammer.

8788
04:07:03,040 --> 04:07:03,940
Is a head pat.

8789
04:07:04,220 --> 04:07:04,580
Why?

8790
04:07:07,360 --> 04:07:07,980
You guys.

8791
04:07:08,000 --> 04:07:08,580
Want a head pat.

8792
04:07:08,700 --> 04:07:08,980
Emote.

8793
04:07:09,020 --> 04:07:09,320
So bad.

8794
04:07:09,380 --> 04:07:09,980
I should commission.

8795
04:07:10,060 --> 04:07:10,760
Some more emotes.

8796
04:07:10,760 --> 04:07:11,160
I'll be honest.

8797
04:07:11,240 --> 04:07:11,800
I haven't.

8798
04:07:12,300 --> 04:07:12,740
Commissioned any.

8799
04:07:13,200 --> 04:07:13,560
But.

8800
04:07:15,740 --> 04:07:16,100
Okay.

8801
04:07:16,740 --> 04:07:17,560
I'm gonna head out.

8802
04:07:17,720 --> 04:07:18,020
Because.

8803
04:07:18,120 --> 04:07:18,460
Tomorrow.

8804
04:07:18,680 --> 04:07:19,040
Is.

8805
04:07:19,240 --> 04:07:20,100
Quite a long day.

8806
04:07:20,180 --> 04:07:20,540
As well.

8807
04:07:21,240 --> 04:07:22,100
And I have.

8808
04:07:22,680 --> 04:07:23,360
I have.

8809
04:07:23,860 --> 04:07:24,220
Early.

8810
04:07:25,140 --> 04:07:25,500
Stream.

8811
04:07:25,860 --> 04:07:26,220
So.

8812
04:07:26,280 --> 04:07:27,000
I will see you guys.

8813
04:07:27,180 --> 04:07:27,540

8814
04:07:27,720 --> 04:07:27,880
For.

8815
04:07:28,580 --> 04:07:29,300
Metal Gear.

8816
04:07:34,060 --> 04:07:35,000
I'm so excited.

8817
04:07:35,420 --> 04:07:35,820
Okay.

8818
04:07:36,000 --> 04:07:37,340
Thank you guys.

8819
04:07:37,420 --> 04:07:38,220
For the long stream.

8820
04:07:38,480 --> 04:07:38,880
But.

8821
04:07:39,160 --> 04:07:39,560
Today.

8822
04:07:40,200 --> 04:07:40,780
Longer stream.

8823
04:07:40,920 --> 04:07:41,320
At least.

04:07:41,480 --> 04:07:42,520

Later.

8828
04:07:48,020 --> 04:07:48,820
Have a good night.

8829
04:07:50,020 --> 04:07:51,040
And if I don't see you.

8830
04:07:51,080 --> 04:07:51,420

04:07:51,520 --> 04:07:52,380
Have a great weekend.

Go.

8835
04:07:55,320 --> 04:07:55,720
Go.

8836
04:07:56,180 --> 04:07:56,580
Go.

8837
04:07:57,700 --> 04:07:58,100
Go.

8838
04:07:59,720 --> 04:08:00,120
Go.

8839
04:08:00,240 --> 04:08:00,320
Go.

8840
04:08:00,480 --> 04:08:00,880
Go.

Go.
