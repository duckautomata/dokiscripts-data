00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes.

87
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,260
Other than playing games?

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,460
Because we're definitely going to play games like after the
stream, right?

89
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,040

95
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,940

We're just going to take some of these snacks.

99
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,100
I'm rummaging through your kitchen.

100
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,160
That's over there.

101
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720

102
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,480

00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,120
Yeah, I guess this is a thing now.

104
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,520
You got snacks.

105
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,800
You got Ramune over there.

106
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,860
Literally right behind us.

107
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,560
Yeah, exactly.

108
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,260
To be fair, I have got everything, but that will be 500 yen.

109
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Thank you very much.

110
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,640
500 yen?

111
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,440
Can I put that into love?

112
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,920
Okay, no, that's kind of steve, actually.

113
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,140

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,780
Yeah, I know.

115
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,240

116
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm sorry, guys.

117
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,360
Yeah, no, you're right.

118
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,800
You're right.

119
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,600
10,000 yen for the ramen.

120
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,780
10,000.

121
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,300
Oh.

122
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,660
That's more like, that's those California prices right
there.

123
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,000
10,000 yen for a ramen.

124
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,100
You know, once I stayed at a hotel in California and they
had instant ramen, like the Cup ramen, and it was $7.

125
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,200
What?

126
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:42,960
What?

127
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,760
Yeah, $7 USD for Cup ramen.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
That's crazy.

129
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:49,980
What?

130
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
That's insane!

131
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,500
Yeah.

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,380
What?

133
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,140
Did it come with like toppings or anything?

134
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,740
No, it was Maru-chan.

135
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,820

136
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,300

137
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,000
That's so weird.

138
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,820
It was very strange.

139
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm scared.

140
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,900
I'm scared of prices in America.

141
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,600
I don't think I'm gonna be able to afford anything.

142
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,640
I think so.

143
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm scared of America.

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,680

151

I enjoyed it.

153
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,160
It's very tasty.

154
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,840
Victoria Roman has been to a Waffle House, but I've never
been to a Waffle House.

155

178
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,180
What are we gonna say?

179
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,480
I heard that humans taste and smell the most like...

180
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,620
We're most close in composition to pigs, so like we might
taste like bacon.

181
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,140
So technically it's bacon, maple bacon, if you do that.

182
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,060
Maple bacon.

183
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,560
I feel like I zoned out for one second.

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,440
How did I... How did we get here again?

185
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,360
How did we get... Oh, it's a cannibalism?

186
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,260
Oh, weapon of choice.

187
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,760
Poor Vicky's trying to fix her chat.

188
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,480
No, you're like...

189
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,780
Oh, what is... What is going on, guys?

190
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,120
Uh, give me one sec.

191
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,440
Let me just see if this fixes it.

192
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,660
I don't know why.

193
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,860
Emote only chat.

194
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,280
It's okay.

195
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah, it's fine.

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,400
If it's emote only, then it's...

197
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,420
It's emote only, but...

198
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,400
We can still see you guys, like, in the YouTube.

199
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,160

204
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,480
It was working before I hit Go Live.

205
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,100
No, it's okay.

206
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,600

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,850
How was your stream?

221
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,690
Yeah.

222
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,190
What were you doing?

223
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,790
It was like Uno, right?

224
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,270
Uno?

225
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,250
Uno.

226
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,210
Uno.

227
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,090
Oh, no.

228
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:47,930
Is there something else?

229
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,550
Dragon Ball.

230
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,930
Dragon Ball.

231
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,090
Dragon Ball.

232
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,550
Yeah.

233
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,130
Dragon Ball Uno.

234
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,170
Dragon Ball.

235
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,730
Oh, actually, I can imagine that.

236
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,530
Someone animate that.

237
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,410
Dragon Ball Uno.

238
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,770
I would play that.

239
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:02,830
Is that a thing?

240
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,050
Oh, heck yeah.

241
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,930
Hmm.

242
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,190
Yeah, we're just going to own it.

243
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,730
We're just going to own it.

244
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,250
Own the emoji-only chat.

245
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,310
We're doing it live.

246
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,290
Yeah.

247
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,350
Welcome, everyone.

248
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,230
Welcome, welcome.

249
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,950
Welcome, everyone.

250
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,890
We should be tonight.

251
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,830
We should play Uno.

252
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,010
I feel like Uno can make or break a friendship, you know,
guys.

253
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,990
Are we ready for Uno?

254
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,610
I think we've been through a lot.

255
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,590
Didn't we say that about something else?

256
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,510
There was a different game that we played together at one
point.

257
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,410
And we were like, this is going to make or break our friend.

258
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,030
It might have been golf with friends.

259
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,550
And clearly we're still friends.

260
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,110
Maybe more than friends.

261
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,030
What?

262
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:56,990
Family.

263
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,890

264
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,710
It was like welcome to Phoebe's thruffle or something.

265
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:02,470

If you land on one of those three colors, we will pick a
question from the marshmallow pile.

311
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:41,980
And then we also came up with our own questions, or we are,
we will come up with them in our brain on the spot.

312
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,080
Oh, whoops.

317
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,680

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,960
Okay, okay.

411
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,240
Okay.

412
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,220
What?

413
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,560
What?

414
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,360
Do you?

415
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,500
Okay, I'm gonna, should I read it out loud since it's my
question?

416
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,200
Victoria Roman.

417
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,800
Do you remove your socks with your toes or with your hands?

418
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,980
Who removes it with the toes?

419
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,980
Is this a thing?

420
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,580
Wait, huh?

421
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,120
Wait, you don't remove it with your toes?

422
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:47,940
No?

423
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,200
You could...

424
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,040
Okay, that's why I thought it was the real time to remove it
with my toes.

425
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,540
Wait.

426
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,680
I remove...

427
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,920
You know, like a monkey, you just kind of stick your...

428
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
big toe in there and

429
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,480
I like I step on the other sock and then I pull my foot out.

430
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,560
Oh yeah that would do that.

431
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,880
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

432
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,220
That's another reason too.

433
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,380
But you can do it monkey style if you want monkey style.

434
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,040
Okay.

435
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:26,420
I will admit I think one time where I for some reason I was
like I don't know I was like type and something.

436
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,060
I think I did remove one with my mouth once.

437
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,220
One time.

438
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,860
judging for toes and you remote it with your mouth?

439
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,400
It was one time!

440
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
But I remember.

441
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,640
What could you have been doing?

442
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,780
That was so...

443
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,100
Why?

444
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,940
Probably typing an essay about Shadow the Hedgehog.

445
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,360
I was just too invested.

446
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,500
What?

447
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,700
You couldn't stop for a second just to take it off normal?

448
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,440
Again.

449
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,120
I shouldn't have judged you guys for using your toes.

450
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
I understand now.

451
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:02,880
I'm sorry.

452
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,780

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,160

But not very many places have honey.

482
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,600

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,640

503
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,760
Oh, like shower, like a meteor shower.

504
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,620
or something, not like sweat and water.

505
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,340
No, this isn't Pekari sweat, but I love Pekari sweat
actually.

506
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,420
Wait, what about a shower makes you think of?

507
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,740
I don't know.

508
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,600
Like, if you think it's like shower flavored, it's like
water, isn't it?

509
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,300
No, I think it's like a star shower.

510
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,220
Like, it's like the star shower.

511
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,200
The very famous shampoo flavor.

512
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,820
I don't know.

513
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,860
Damn!

514
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,560
Wasn't that like a meme though in the VTuber community like
a long time ago?

515
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,020
Or like, what's your shampoo flavor?

516
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
I want to drink your shampoo.

517
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,160
Oh, really?

518
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,780
I don't know.

519
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,280
Am I wrong?

520
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,780
Am I too...

521
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,840
Am I... Mandela affected?

522
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,380
No, no, I just... I don't remember this, but...

523
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,380
I think... I think what kind of shampoo would I have?

524
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,280
I think it would smell like a... like a retro cafe.

525
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,860
I think it would smell like pudding and pizza toast.

526
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,320
Hopefully a non-smoking one.

527
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,820
Yeah, it just gives it a nice smoky flavor.

528
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,680
Smoked pudding.

529
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,440
Smoked pudding?

530
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,540
Smoked pudding.

531
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,200
Interesting.

532
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,580
It's sophisticated.

533
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,180
Only grown-ups can enjoy it.

534
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,840
Oh, what about you guys?

535
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,360
Shampoo.

536
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,080
Okay, we know we should probably do another question first.

537
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,440
All right, we're getting into our own question.

538
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,520
Wait, save that.

539
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,360
is your question.

540
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:35,940
Save that one.

541
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Yeah!

542
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Yeah!

543
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,340
I don't know why we've returned to the star, but that's
fine.

544
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,680
I can move us back.

545
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Okay.

546
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,060
Oh, oopsie.

547
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,640
You were over here.

548
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,740
And it's...

549
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,520
I was...

550
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,180
Over here.

551
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,440
Alright, Phoebe, it's time for you to roll!

552
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,780
Here we go!

553
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,880
Go, go!

554
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,680
What?

555
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,600
Five?

556
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,680
What's our five?

557
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,280
I think that...

558
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:17,560

and say hi to you

561
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,790
Hi Phoebe What are you saying about us that we're not doing
very well, huh?

562
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,570
Is that what you're saying?

563
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:49,510
You know?

564
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,370
Who's saying that?

565
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,410
Yeah, yeah.

566
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,670
Phoebe said she should come back to the start to be with us.

567
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,990
Like, I'm coming back to the start.

568
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:55,970
I'm coming back to the start.

569
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,070
So near the start.

570
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,510
Oh, yeah, because we're all at the start.

571
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,350
You're saying that we should be way behind or right?

572
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,150
I mean, none of us are really progressing so far, but don't
worry.

573
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,370
That's about to change.

574
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,890
Because I'm about.

00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,690
Should we just do a marshmallow?

584
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,270
What do you think?

585
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,870
Yeah, we could do a marshmallow though.

586
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,030
Yeah, let's do a marshmallow.

587
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,370
I also have a question though.

588
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:56,770
Oh!

589
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,310
Let's do it then.

590
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,470
Let's do it.

591
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,830
How do you like your steak?

592
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,450
Oh!

593
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,690
How well done do you have your steak?

594
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,890
Actually, is it okay if I ask both of you guys?

595
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,310
this because I need to know.

596
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,010
Yeah.

597
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,370
We're going to be, like, hanging out a lot.

598
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,350
I need to know how you like your steak.

599
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,350
Are we going to be making steak a lot?

600
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,710
No, it just says a lot about a person.

601
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,290
Ah, I like medium rare.

602
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,710
Medium rare.

603
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,150
What about you, Vicky?

604
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,230
I also like medium rare.

605
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,470
Oh, we're so, we're so back.

606
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,250
This is...

607
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,330
This is why I love you guys.

608
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,470
This is why I love you.

609
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,090
You passed.

610
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,290
You passed the vibe check.

611
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:40,910
This is fine.

612
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,650
Okay, good.

613
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,150
What?

614
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,130
I was scared for a second.

615
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,190
Wait, Phoebe, you also like medium rare?

616
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,330
We're all the same.

617
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,190
We're all the same?

618
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,170
Oh my gosh.

619
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,170
Meant to be, guys.

620
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,230
Meant to be.

621
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,030
Yeah.

622
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,270
Yo.

623
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,210
Medium rare, the goat.

624
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,370
You know what I'm saying, chat.

625
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,710
Yes, yes, yes.

626
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,070
Well done, everyone.

627
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,990
We got the right answer.

628
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,930
Good job, good job, everybody.

629
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,650
Good job, team.

630
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,670
I wrote right answers to any of these questions except for
that one.

631
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,970
Phoebe is definitely a pinnate or a steak.

632
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:16,930
We've learned that much.

633
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:18,410
Mintos!

634
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,090
Whoa!

635
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:20,710
Six.

636
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,110
Damn!

637
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:23,410
Okay.

638
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,230
Okay.

639
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,150
One, two, three, four, five, six.

640
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,950
Oh, it's a mint question, I think, from Marshmallow.

641
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:31,750
Oh!

642
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,570
All right, let me find.

643
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,090
Do-do-do-do-do.

644
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,950
Yes, that's my name.

645
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,390
Don't wear it out.

646
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,390
Okay, here we go.

647
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:55,170
It's been over a month since your last book recommendation.

648
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,570
Book with strange quotes.

649
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,430
Oh, I love books.

650
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,330
What does this mean?

651
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,410
Could we get a new one?

652
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,210
Uh...

653
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,940
Oh, real quick.

654
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,760
Welcome, Raiders.

655
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,920
Thank you so much for the ring.

656
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,780
Welcome, welcome.

657
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Welcome.

658
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,220
Welcome, welcome.

659
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,680
I hope you had a good stream.

660
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,480
Thank you so much for being here.

661
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,680
I hope you had a good stream.

662
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,480
Yeah.

663
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,100
Well, um, honestly, I've been like so busy to even read
anything.

664
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,400
Um, hold on.

665
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,680
Let me check if I had anything in my...

666
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,680
In my audiobooks.

667
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,260
Uh...

668
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,920
Yaoi.

669
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,540
Oh, I'm so old.

670
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,600
man yowie.

671
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,220
I wish.

672
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,240
You wish.

673
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,300
You can make those dreams come true, you know.

674
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,080
Yeah.

675
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,720
Yeah.

676
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,480
Oh, wait.

677
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,120
Oh, wait.

678
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,700
So they're not actual books?

679
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,300
Oh, sorry.

680
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:00,580
Go ahead.

681
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,120
Go ahead.

682
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,580
They're books.

683
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:03,880
They're...

684
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,160
Well, I was listening to...

685
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,560
I don't know if I finished this one.

686
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,320
I don't even remember anything about it.

687
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,420
Oh, I do remember a little bit about it.

688
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,320
It was kind of bad.

689
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,180
It was called Hello Billionaire.

690
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,360
Oh.

691
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,860
Oh.

692
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,340
Hello.

693
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,840
I will go look it up.

694
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:24,640
No.

695
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,260
No.

696
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:25,860
No.

697
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,580
No.

698
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,340
No.

699
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:27,980
No.

700
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,960
Why not, Miss Mint Fandom?

701
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,000
What could there be in this book that we should not be
looking up?

702
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,100
It was, oh my gosh, wait, when we were together and Phoebe
was just like, I love cryptids.

703
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,280
And I was talking about the Mothman book that I read not too
long ago.

704
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,380
I got so excited.

705
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,080
I was like, oh, Mothman, I love cryptids.

706
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,820
And then...

707
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,380
Mothman?

708
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Maybe I'll look up this.

709
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,180
Maybe I'll look up this book.

710
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,920
And Mint was like, hmm.

711
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,760
Maybe you don't want to look up this book.

712
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,480
Should I...

713
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,800
Should I...

714
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,260
Oh.

715
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:10,880
Um...

716
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,820
I don't even, I think I'm, I, I feel so empowered on my own
stream to say these things, but then when I am, when I am

717
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,380
faced with my own, with my own actions, I get so
embarrassed.

718
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,640
It's like all of the, all of the staff are listening meant
they're all.

719
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:38,320
Look, look, any literature is literature and we will not
judge you for what literature you consume because at least

720
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,440
you read.

721
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,040
So well said, Phoebe.

722
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,160
So well said.

723
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,540
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, it's okay.

724
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,940
Should we move on, Min?

725
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,840
Should we move on?

726
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,100
I think we should move on.

727
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,580
I will give the person an answer.

728
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,220
I will say, I haven't been reading much Dojin lately, but
the next time I do, I will recommend something.

Phoebe!

747
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,120
So something I've been meaning to ask for a while.

748
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,240
Ami and Ami discover a current huge Phoebe fan hit.

749
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,620
Were the lyrics in start again.

750
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,800
So I took a leap of faith with you in the Varsan story.

751
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,520
Blue.

752
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,320
Meant to be a hint.

753
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,840
Oh, are they just a happy coincidence.

754
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,420
Just a little potential curiosity I noticed pretty early on.

755
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,860
In Learning Ami was Phoebe and Klaus.

756
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:19,720
going for your songs would you like to answer this one yes
i'm very i'm i love geeking out about my own lyric writing

757
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:29,580
and songwriting process um yeah so i'm really happy happy
somebody noticed but there were a bunch of like so i wrote

758
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:37,340
start again and i put out my first album uh right before i
went on hiatus to join prism project and i wanted to like

759
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:44,680
hint as much as possible but first of it was just kind of
like for my own personal satisfaction because i was like i

760
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:51,520
want to commemorate this important time in my life um but
also i love to put referential stuff and like hints and like

761
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:59,720
meta stuff into my writing so yes that was on purpose and
also if you notice in the album art and the music video for

762
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:08,840
start again there's hydrangeas everywhere and amy's model
has like hydrangeas so specifically pink hydrangeas so that

763
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:18,080
was on purpose to kind of of be like hello Phoebe Hive come

Wait, but they were only sold 30.

Did they custom make it to you?

778
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,880
I have big feet, so they probably wouldn't even have it.

779
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,900
Yeah, there's a good point.

780
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,420

781
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,800
Yeah, I don't know.

782
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,840

783
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,580
All right, guys.

784
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,120

Great.

793
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,080

Right, okay.

795
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,340

00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,340
Our first staff question.

806
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,020

Questions from staff, son.

00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,220
What are your favorite and least favorite Japanese snacks?

815
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,300
Is this for the group?

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,360

817
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,220
Where do you go?

818
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,500
Well, I can go first if you like.

819
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,600

820
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,560
So, seaweed flavored crisps.

821
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:51,000

the chopped cucumber and stuff with the with the miso miso

822
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:00,980

umeboshi candies that you can get literally the worst thing

823
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:07,940
in the world why do they sell them get that away from my
face I'm glad you also don't like umeboshi I don't like it

824
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,600
either it's okay I also don't like umeboshi Yeah!

825
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,700
We had that medium rare steak and no umeboshi.

826
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:17,920
Heck yeah.

827
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,220
Wow.

828
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,180
We're sounding so American.

829
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,700
That's how I don't want them Japanese umeboshi and I want my
steak medium rare.

830
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,220
My steak medium rare.

831
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,580
I want my sweet tea, my medium rare steak and I don't want
none of that umeboshi.

832
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,860
How did I do it?

833
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:40,960
Good.

834
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,200
That was real good.

835
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,620
Good.

836
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,700
What about you guys?

837
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,840
What's your favorite?

838
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,220
And least favorite?

839
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
I think recently...

840
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,520
Yeah, I'll go.

841
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,940
Recently, I've been super into these, like, Japanese jelly
gummies called Kororo.

842
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,040
Oh!

843
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,120
And they're like...

844
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,240
It's like...

845
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,920
It feels almost like an actual, like, grape.

846
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,120
I get the grape flavor.

847
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,760
It's, like, super, like, jelly and, like...

848
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,080
Oh, I've seen those.

849
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,740
Recently they've come to the States, they've been selling
them at like Japanese stores in the States.

850
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,200
So I really recommend them.

851
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,540
They're super, they're such an interesting texture.

852
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,620
I love it.

853
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,200
What's the texture like?

854
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,080
It's like, it's almost like a gusher, but like it's, it's, I
don't know how to...

855
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,200
Yeah, can someone translate gusher for me?

856
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,160
I guess we gotta experiment or experience it.

857
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,620
Oh, a gusher is like...

858
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,940
Don't they have...

859
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,860
Well, to be honest, I never had gushers as a kid.

860
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,500
So...

861
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,200
Yeah, okay.

862
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,200
It's not even like it, though.

863
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,020
It's so strange.

864
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,200
It's like...

865
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,540
You know how sometimes you can get jellies where it has like
a...

866
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,340
I don't know how to describe it at all.

867
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,840
I'm going to bring it to you.

868
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,760
I'm going to bring it to you.

869
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,220
That's what we need to do.

870
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,200
We need to do like...

871
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,880
You guys need to show me all of the best American snacks.

872
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,860
And I will judge them.

873
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,920
I will judge them.

874
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,580
I wouldn't say gusher is a great American snack.

875
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,000
But it's not even, that's like the best way to describe it,
but it's not even close at all.

876
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,600
I just, I feel like you just gotta try it.

877
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,620
Kororo, everybody.

878
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,360
Kororo.

879
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:22,900
Kororo.

880
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:23,560
Yeah.

881
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,200
Kororo.

882
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,220
Kororo, yeah.

883
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:26,840
Kororo.

884
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,080
Go check it out.

885
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,220
What about you, Phoebe?

886
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,460
Yeah.

887
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:38,400
So for, for, for sweet stuff, I love pudding so much.

febby's video before like we did some uh like uh what's the

934
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:35,720
word a rehearsal run through yeah practice run yeah and
vicky and i were crying at her video then and it made me cry

935
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,280
again I was like, I finished the video and I was like, how
was it?

936
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,820
And then all I hear is...

937
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,400
And I was like, oh!

938
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:47,880
Yeah!

939
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,780
Absolute cinema, I was bawling, man.

940
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,800
Like the beginning video is so good.

941
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,300

Well, thank you.

945
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,380
I think all of our debuts were very us, so...

946
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,060
They were very us.

947
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:17,560
us yeah as for the name dead sets to exe yeah do we want to
talk about that later i don't know when do we want to talk

948
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:24,060
about it i don't know we could do it we could do it if it
depends do we want to talk about do we want to talk about

949
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:30,940
the whole group the whole story about behind everything
later is that something we want to do we have more time than

950
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:36,220
we thought because yeah i know We could do the video and
then talk about it.

951
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:44,180
Actually, yeah, because it kind of all, we had the same
rationale behind that as we did about a bunch of other

952
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:44,560
stuff.

953
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,380

reading it too hi Vicky congrats on the debut I'm so happy

1019
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:09,020
for you and I wish you nothing but the best however there's
a very important question that I have to ask you and it goes

1020
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:19,880
a little slightly like this can you feel life moving through
your mind oh it's like you came out for more yeah can you

1021
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:33,020
feel time slipping down your spine oh you're trying to
ignore yeah Hey, Vicky, enjoy

1022
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,220
it.

1023
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,380
That was wonderful.

1024
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,840
I said this before, right?

1025
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:53,060
But, like, genuinely, I think we could do the best, like,
Tails, Sonic Knuckles, like, collab, or something.

1026
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:58,540
Like, Phoebe would be Tails, Min would be Sonic, and I would
be Knuckles, and, you know, it would be great.

1027
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't know.

1028
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,520
I don't know what we'd do, but we'd do something, you know?

1029
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,540
We would do something.

1030
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,200
We would.

1031
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,920
I think it would be the, you're Sonic.

1032
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,520
You're, so you give the Sonic.

1033
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,320
energy, Minto.

1034
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,860
It's a good thing.

1035
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,300
Why are you sad?

1036
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,660
I feel like Bibi would be a perfect Amy, to be honest.

1037
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,140
Yeah, okay, she would, to be fair.

1038
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,440
Amy is my best girl.

1039
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,080
Yeah.

1040
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:20,840
I do love her.

1041
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,980

00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:30,720
Rup.

1046
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,320
Oh, Minto is winning this by a long way so far.

1047
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,660
Are you sure the dice are different?

1048
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:44,120
One, two, three, four, five, six is purple!

1049
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,060
Purple!

1050
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,560
Which is...

1051
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,220
Questions from us.

1052
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,260
Oh, I...

1053
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,440
Okay, from me.

1055
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,460
Oh, or you can...

1056
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,000
If you have one prepared already, Vicky.

1057
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,640
I don't, but I can think of one.

1058
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:58,280
Um...

1059
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:58,740
Anything.

1060
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,860
I believe in you.

1061
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,520
You're dying questions.

1062
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:02,700
Okay.

1063
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,620
Um...

1064
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,660
Um...

1065
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,100
Um...

1066
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:07,520
Um...

1067
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:09,420
Um...

1068
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,080
Um...

1069
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:13,860
Um...

1070
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,440
Hmm...

1071
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:16,580
Hum...

1072
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,520
Okay, if we were all to take a...

1073
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,740
You know, if you guys were to come to Japan, we would take a
trip to Japan.

1074
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,320
Where would you guys want to go?

1075
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,600
On a trip together.

1076
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,360
Or it doesn't have to be Japan.

1077
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,420
Could be another country.

1078
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,180
Could be anywhere.

1079
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,780
Where would you guys want to go?

1080
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,480
Okay.

1081
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,240
I have my question.

1082
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:36,980
I have my answer.

1083
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,860
by you Phoebe okay let's go let's go mint first you got an
answer where do you want to go together okay well you said

1084
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:54,500
Japan so I was thinking Japan hold on let me make sure I get
the name of this place right actually Phoebe go ahead oh I

1085
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:04,220
was gonna I was gonna say the name of my favorite the cafe I
took you to Vicky but but maybe I wanna maybe I want to keep

1086
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:12,140
it keep it a little low key restaurants go viral on tick
tock and then all of a sudden you can't get in anymore that

1087
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:18,960
was so cute though i love that place there was a cute
cottage core cafe with like a craft shop attached to it so

1088
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:29,860
lovely but if not that then a hakone maybe oh that would be
nice yeah because i love um there's like a really really

1089
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:37,840
nice open air museum there oh yeah and then there's like the
shrines and stuff i love going to shine we can go on the

1090
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:47,080
smelly cable car there's a smelly why is it smelly because
it's like sulfuric so you go over the top of the sulfur bin

1091
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,080
it smells like farts

1092
00:59:53,140 --> 01:00:04,400
whoever smells it dealt it yeah we should we should go what
about yeah we should um well my My unrealistic answer is

1093
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,440
Antarctica, but we could totally make it, you know?

1094
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:07,900
Wow!

1095
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,760
I've always wanted to go!

1096
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:10,840
Yeah!

1097
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,320
We should go!

1098
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,140
We should go!

1099
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,540
Is that where you can see the lights?

1100
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,200
The northern notes?

1101
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,460
Well, they only come out in the winter, but...

1102
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,340
Well, they're easier to see in the winter, but going...

1103
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,340
But the trips are for, like, pedestrians are only in the
summer and...

1104
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,940
Like, late spring and summer.

1105
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,360
So...

1106
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,480
But it's not...

1107
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,860
It's not impossible.

1108
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,520
Well, I've got another suggestion kind of on that theme
where we could see the Northern Lights as well.

1109
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,960
I want to go Lapland!

1110
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,820
I want to go meet Santa!

1111
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,180
Oh, Santa!

1112
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:47,800
Yeah!

1113
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,100
Yeah, I want to go have the ultimate Christmas experience
with you guys.

1114
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,520
I think that would be amazing.

1115
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,180
That would be so fun!

1116
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,900
That would be so fun!

1117
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,120
I have one more thing for the opposite of that.

1118
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,680
What do you mean the opposite?

1119
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,800
Well, that would be cold, and this would be nice and toasty.

1120
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:13,600
But there's a new park that just recently opened in Okinawa
called Jungleia.

1121
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,840
I want to try it.

1122
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,700
Yeah, we gotta go to Jungleia.

1123
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:21,120
It's an amusement park that's dinosaur themed.

1124
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,960
And you get chased by a T-Rex.

1125
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,360
I want to go.

1126
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,540
That sounds so well.

1127
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,740
I love dinosaurs.

1128
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,340
Because chasing, being chased by a T-Rex.

1129
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:40,460
sounds kind of oh yeah you're in a car and the t-rex like
chases after you oh my god like a giant animatronic it's so

1130
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:51,240

1131
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:58,140

1132
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,290

1133
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,140

One, two, three, four, five.

1138
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,320
That is our orange, which I believe is stuff.

1139
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,820
Stuff question?

1140
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,120
Stuff question.

1141
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,120
Which one was marshmallow again?

1142
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,100
Again, a lot.

1143
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:21,760
Whichever?

1144
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,620
What do you want to do?

1145
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,900
Let's do group marshmallow, maybe.

1146
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:25,420
Okay.

1147
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,480
Yeah, I took group.

1148
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,800
Show to a minute.

01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,440
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

1150

Bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada,
bada, bada, bada, bada, this is a good question.

1151
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:40,760
Howdy.

1152
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,840
Will you do a podcast-like thing?

1153
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,780
It doesn't have to be a regular or have a five-star runtime,
but three goofy girls.

1154
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,740
Yeah, what does that mean?

1155
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,720
Three goofy girls being goofy about stuff is my favorite
kind of yashike.

1156
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,720
Thank you.

1157
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,060
That's also one of my favorite kinds of yashike.

1158
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,580
I had an idea, right?

1159
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,380
That radio show idea.

1160
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1161
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:16,260
So, actually what I want to do is I want to put together a
monthly radio show for us when possible and have different

1162
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:16,920
corners.

1163
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:23,660
So, like, let's look at people's fan art corner and then,
oh, this is user-submitted questions or like a Batu game

1164
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:30,740
corner or an announcement corner and just different kinds of
like silly and serious corners and stuff.

1165
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:42,040
awesome yeah maybe we can like introduce like uh music on
there as well we could be like a radio oh yeah that'd be

1166
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:49,200
nice highlight some of our new favorites or maybe like
talented people in the community yeah that sounds like so

1167
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:58,040
much fun but i'd love to do that with you guys yeah all
right i'm gonna roll hopefully not a one again this time oh

1168
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:04,260
yes my my luck is changing I'm moving up in the world.

1169
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:08,020
One, two, three, four, five.

1170
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,460
I think I think I'm there.

1171
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,600
Is that a member?

1172
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,140
A member question, I think.

1173
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:15,700
Yeah, a member.

1174
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,320
Okay, let's have a look.

Okay.

1177
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,480
If I win, you can say that it's rigged.

1178
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,200
That's understandable.

1179
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,280
Rigged, rigged.

1180
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:26,340
Okay.

1181
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,580

What is your relation to Sir Times New?

1187
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:47,880
That yoga has been haunting my word for us since time
immemorial.

1188
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:55,680
Did you know, chat, that Sir Times New is actually Michael's
dad?

1189
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:57,900
Whoa.

Yeah.

1192
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,400
You need to start drawing up the family tree, guys.

1193
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,780
Wait, what is Michael's relation to you, then?

1194
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,600
Michael is my butler.

1195
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,560
Yeah, so...

1196
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,160
Yeah, but he's related because he's also a Roman.

01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,960
I undo those claps.

1216
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:18,540
What is that?

1217
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,340
No!

1218
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,700
What does that say?

1219
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,080
Hang on, I need to...

1220
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,700
It says jump to end.

1221
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,060
No, it doesn't.

1222
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,300
Jump to end.

1223
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,040
Go back.

1224
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,680
Five!

1225
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:31,620
No!

1226
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,200
Five!

1227
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,460
Three, four, five.

1228
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,620
Oh, dear.

1229
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,080
Oh, dear, Minto.

1230
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,020
Zanin, Zanin, Zanin.

1231
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,000
Purple.

1232
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,840
I think that is what?

1233
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,180
Group marshmallow?

1234
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,060
Let's go.

1235
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:48,660
Group marshmallow.

1236
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,840
We can do group.

1237
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,360
Yeah, we haven't done a lot of group ones.

1238
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,780
Yeah, let's do it.

1239
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,400
Let's do it.

1240
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:53,800
Okay.

1241
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,120
We make our own rules, everybody.

1242
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,820
Whatever color we want it to be, it will be.

1243
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,220
you want to accomplish together as an idol group.

1244
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,580
We got lots of those.

1245
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,380
So many things.

1246
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,140
I know.

1247
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,120
I feel like...

1248
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,480
Do we list them all?

1249
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:20,760
Yeah, are we announcing some of our dreams right here and
now?

1250
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,340
Right here and now?

1251
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,320
Right here and now?

1252
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,580
Right here?

1253
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,160
Right now?

1254
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,320
This is the perfect place, I think.

1255
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:35,180
I think one of the things we really wanted as a three
Ambassadors of Akihabara was one of them.

1256
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:35,560
Yeah!

1257
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:37,120
Yeah.

1258
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:37,900
That was one thing.

1259
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:46,180
If we can spread Akihabara culture and fun times to the
world, that would be really, really awesome.

1260
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,280
We'd love to do that.

1261
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,960
What were some of the other things?

1262
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,360
You guys can say some of the other ones.

1263
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,760
I'm trying to think.

1264
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:58,700
We definitely talked about wanting to have a tie-in with an
anime or a game or something.

1265
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,880
Then Setsu-do AXE anime opening.

1266
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,800
That would be so heckin' cool.

1267
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:05,580
Yeah.

1268
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,220
We can do it.

1269
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:22,620
Another one that I like incorporating our lore and our story
into 3D lives someday would be really, really cool, you

1270
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:22,820
know?

1271
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,420
We want to have like an ongoing story thing.

1272
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,400
Yeah, kind of like almost a stage play in a way.

1273
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,440
You should stick around till later.

1274
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:41,500
later chat if you want to find out about more of the story
of den sensei yeah what is the story yeah what's going on

1275
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:51,940
any other things to add i mean yeah i think honestly like
just being able to to perform on more and more stages do a

1276
01:08:51,940 --> 01:09:03,360
world tour you know yeah we can do that that'd be so cool we
want to meet a lot of you guys everywhere yeah Yeah.

1277
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,180
And spread Akima culture throughout the world.

1278
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,420
That's our goal.

1279
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:09,480
Yep.

1280
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:10,820
Yeah!

1281
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:11,800
Yeah!

1282
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,780
That's just a few.

1283
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,840
That's a few.

1284
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:14,260
I know.

1285
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,200
I'm trying to think of the document we wrote.

1286
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,240
We have a whole document chat somewhere.

1287
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,060
Yeah.

1288
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,240
So many documents.

1289
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:24,840
Yay!

1290
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,400
Yay, yay, yay!

1291
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,600
All right.

1292
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,520
So I think that was...

1293
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,000
Who landed on that one?

1294
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,280
Minto.

1295
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:30,740
Okay.

1296
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,680
So now it's Phoebe!

1297
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,360
Real quick, real quick, apparently I'm on an instruction
space.

1298
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:43,460
I saw in chat, I can't see very well, but I think I'm on an
instruction space, so I need to go back or whatever what it

1299
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:43,820
says.

1300
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,700
Wait, I thought you were on the orange, really?

1301
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,980
Are you on orange, I thought I was on the orange, too.

1302
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,280
Yeah, you should be on, oh, the orange has an instruction,
uh-oh.

1303
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,220
Oh.

1304
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,640
What's it say?

1305
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,060
Go back for, oh, thanks, chat, thank you.

1306
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,100
Thank you for pointing that out.

1307
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:58,960
That's really sweet.

1308
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,920
Chat is like sabotaging me.

1309
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,440
Thank you, chat.

1310
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:03,800
That's really nice of you, chat.

1311
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,580
How nice.

1312
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,420
You know, I just realized when I made this, I didn't put
any, like, go forward.

1313
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,920
I only put it.

1314
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,700
We are only doomed.

1315
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:17,440
Oh, my God.

1316
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:17,840
My bad.

1317
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,440
Sorry.

1318
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,600
No, no.

1319
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,100
Don't worry.

1320
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,700
It makes it more fun.

1321
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,440
Now we're more evenly spaced out, I think.

1322
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,440
But it's still anyone's game.

1323
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,900
I thought we would get through it too quickly.

1324
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,580
So I was like, keep going back.

1325
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,760
Keep going back.

1326
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,500
I will roll from here.

1327
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,480
Three for Phoebe.

1328
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,640
One, two, three.

1329
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,140
That is a Phoebe.

1330
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,320
Phoebe question from the marshmallow.

1331
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:49,810
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1332
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:50,870
What?

1333
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:52,890
This, okay, this is an interesting one.

1334
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:58,090
Miss Phoebe, as a bee, do you carry pollen or dust?

1335
01:10:58,930 --> 01:10:59,310
Wow.

1336
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:02,010
Well, pollen is kind of a dust already, isn't it?

1337
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:03,450
But, uh...

1338
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:05,950
I'm, first of all, I'm not a bee.

1339
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:07,730
I am a fairy.

1340
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,510
And so I got fairy dust.

1341
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:16,150
But maybe my fairy dust is comprised of something similar to
pollen because I'm a flower fairy.

1342
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,490
Does it pollinate?

1343
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,190
So, how?

1344
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,630
Does it pollinate?

1345
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:20,790
Do I have...

1346
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,770
Pollinate me, Phoebe.

1347
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,170
Oh, okay.

1348
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:25,630
What?

1349
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:28,950
Wait.

1350
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:30,470
What?

1351
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:33,470
Me too.

1352
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:36,610
I...

1353
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,270
Okay.

1354
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:39,990
Here, I wiggle.

1355
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,930
Wiggle my pollen on you.

1356
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,770
If I shake you, will pollen come out?

1357
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,550
Do not shake babies.

1358
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,070
She's a baby!

1359
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:56,850
I like the idea that when you shake your tush, it's just
pollen.

1360
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:58,210
Yeah, yeah.

1361
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,270
Beads do a thing called a waggle.

1362
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:08,390
And the waggle is how communicate with each other but i'm
sure when they when they do the little waggle that like all

1363
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:14,370
their little dusty comes off comes off their butt and their
legs and stuff their butts and their legs are just covered

1364
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:25,710

Are you able to grant Min-O-F Phoebe your yokai powers?

1378

We were just saying...

1379
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,120
We were literally just talking about...

1380
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:37,880
Or singing this.

1381
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,940

01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,560
Yosei.

1391
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,100
Yeah.

1392
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,960
So, look forward to what that...

1393
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,360
What that means, chat.

1394
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,480
But in the meantime...

1395
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,360
Minto!

1396
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:34,740
Me!

1397
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:35,840
Oh.

1398
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:36,680
Oh.

1399
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,760
That was funky.

1400
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,680
Two.

1401
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,240
Two!

1402
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,520
Member question for Minto.

1403
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,200
Okay.

1404
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:56,200
Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto,
Minto, Minto, Minto.

1405
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:07,760
Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto,
Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto,

1406
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,480
Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto,
Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto, Minto.

1407
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,760
Oh, yes.

1408
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,960
I think this is a good question.

1409
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:17,920
Do you think Phoebe and Vicky amplify your freakiness?

1410
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,660
Or do you try to keep it low-key around them?

1411
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:29,200
Well, I did talk about my books earlier, but I was
embarrassed about my books.

1412
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:29,900
No!

1413
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,600
No, don't be embarrassed about the things you love.

1414
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,260
I don't love them.

1415
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,920
Well, it's like a love paper.

1416
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,040
Huh?

1417
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,160
What?

1418
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:51,860
Maybe, maybe, maybe, I don't know, I think, you know,
eventually we'll all just be super freaks all together.

1419
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:52,620
Yeah!

1420
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,900
People like, yeah!

1421
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,160
People have to spend a lot of time together, rub off on each
other.

1422
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,180
That's very true.

1423
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,480
That's true.

1424
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,000
I feel like we all have our own brand of freakiness, you
know?

1425
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:04,700
That's so true.

1426
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:05,540
Yeah.

1427
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,500
Freaky.exe.

1428
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,520
Freaky.exe.

1429
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,460
I was going to ask what Jarvis...

1430
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,380
Run it!

1431
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,840
Oh god.

1432
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,260
Execute program.

1433
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,240
Freaky.exe.

1434
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,440
I want to know what's in that program.

1435
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:32,820
If it's a combined, combined all three of our freakiness,
I'm scared.

1436
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:33,500
Anyways.

1437
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,600
Oh gosh.

1438
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,900
What could it be?

1439
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:36,620
Phoebe!

1440
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:38,720
Two.

1441
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:39,640
Two for Phoebe.

1442
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:41,960
Okay, it's something.

1443
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:42,900
It's something.

1444
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,880
I think that's...

1445
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,840
I literally cry like a baby.

1446
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,060
Yeah, I'm sorry, Phoebe.

1447
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,560
One, two, three, four, five.

1448
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,700
You're back, you're back to orange again.

1449
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,420
What's orange again?

1450
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,940
Staffs ask questions.

1451
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,040
Dab sound questions!

1452
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:13,940
Dab sound questions!

1453
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,720
Dab sound questions!

1454
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:25,800
I like the comment that Freaky.exe is some combination of
Sonado and Snake and Ocelot and...

1455
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,720
What's inside there?

1456
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,840
What could be?

1457
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,340
What could it be?

1458
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:36,240
I mean that basically just sounds like a Smash fan fiction
or something.

1459
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:36,800
Yeah.

1460
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,960
Like Smash Bros.

1461
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,400
Where they smash.

1462
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,880
What do you like more?

1463
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,620
A manicure or a pedicure?

1464
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,160
Oh.

1465
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,560
I can answer this very easily.

1466
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,120
We can all answer this.

1467
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,480
23, 2, 1.

1468
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:54,940
Okay.

1469
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,960
3, 2, 1.

1470
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:57,740
Pedicure.

1471
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:58,420
Manicure.

1472
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,440
Uncertain.

1473
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:00,080
Oh.

1474
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,300
Why manicure, Minto?

1475
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:14,480
I crave the touch of someone who's by hand.

1476
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,680
Lude handholding.

1477
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,780
Okay, anyway, Mickey.

1478
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:37,180
I mean, honestly, fair.

1479
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,740
I mean, mine is a bit more simple in the...

1480
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:43,140
I love reflexology.

1481
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,460
Like, I love anything with my feet.

1482
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:45,340
Like, I can have, like, a...

1483
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,600
You know, there's, like, really intense massages on your
feet.

1484
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,240
Like, they could do it, like, literally, level 100.

1485
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,100
I'd be like, yeah, this is cool.

1486
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,900
So other things that people say hurt, I'm like, yeah.

1487
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:55,600
So anything on my feet, love.

1488
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,940
So that's why I'd go pedicure.

1489
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,240
Feet enthusiast.

1490
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,440
I'm ticklish.

1491
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,980
They, like, scrub my feet and it makes me laugh.

1492
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,800
It also makes me laugh, too.

1493
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:07,600
Yeah.

1494
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:14,440
But, I mean, it's nice having fresh feet, I guess.

1495
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:18,720
And then you put it on, like, a nice soft carpet, and then
it feels good.

1496
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:19,660
Oh, yeah.

1497
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,920
But like...

1498
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,320
So nice.

1499
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,060
Oh yeah, not manicure or pedicure for me.

1500
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:25,680
It's pre-cure.

1501
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,820
I love pre-cure.

1502
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,120
So I saw someone say pre-cure in chat.

1503
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:30,840
She's so real for that.

1504
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:38,520
But really like, I think manicures are nice because you get
to show off your pretty nails afterwards to everybody.

1505
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,380
But I kind of hate like when you have to get your cuticles
cut.

1506
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:43,800
And then...

1507
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,380
It hurts so much.

1508
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,720
Like for pedicures, it's nice getting your feet massaged.

1509
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,640
But it also tickles.

1510
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,620
So it's like, oh, do I want my fingers to hurt or do I want
my feet to tickle?

1511
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,300
Maybe I just like having pretty nails without the whole
process of it.

1512
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,900
That's so valid.

1513
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:01,360
I just do press-ons nowadays.

1514
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,540
That's kind of becoming a popular thing, huh?

1515
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:05,260
Press-ons.

1516
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:05,860
Yeah, I think so.

1517
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:11,880
And they're reusable, so I could just pop them off when I'm
done and then put them on again when I want to.

1518
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:12,860
That is small.

1519
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,920
Densetsu EXE.

1520
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:15,480
Densetsu.

1521
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,460
Like press-on nails?

1522
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,460
Nailset?

1523
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:18,960
Hello?

1524
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,200
So cute!

1525
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:20,800
Oh my god!

1526
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,720
I want it.

1527
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:23,100
Write that down.

1528
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:23,880
Write that down.

1529
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,460
Write that down.

1530
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:25,660
Write that down.

1531
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,280
Are you listening?

1532
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:27,620
We would love them sets.

1533
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:28,620
EXE nail set.

1534
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,440
I want a pair.

1535
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:33,920
Alrighty.

1536
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,320
I think it is a Mia.

1537
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:36,860
Let's go.

1538
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:38,560
Five.

1539
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:39,480
Okay.

1540
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,420
One, two.

1541
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,920
Am I on the same one as Minto?

1542
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,160
Oh, you might be.

1543
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:46,980
Yeah, I think so.

1544
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,040
Oh, you caught up!

1545
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:49,620
Yeah.

1546
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:52,340
Ah, here I am.

1547
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,060
Here I am.

1548
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:54,700
It's pink.

1549
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:56,580
So I think that's another...

1550
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,560
Let's go with a group mushroom.

1551
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,740
I think it's meant to be a member question.

1552
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,780
But I feel like we want to do more group...

1553
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,300
You can do a group, yeah.

1554
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,220
You can do a group too.

1555
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,880
Someone in the server just said written down.

1556
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:12,740
Press on nails.

1557
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,260
Yay!

1558
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,100
Yeah.

1559
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,080
MVP forever!

1560
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:26,400
excited to see you guys debut are there any companies you'd
love to be sponsored by as a group

1561
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:38,260
sponsored by like like like cool like do a collab with or
like sponsored by like like have them give us money

1562
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:51,060
yeah i think is good should we go with a collab and then a
sort of you know like uh sponsor that we'd like as well.

1563
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:59,360
Well, in terms of collab, I'd love for us, yeah, as I said
before, I'd love for us to do something with Sega.

1564
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,580
That would be amazing.

1565
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,740
That'd be my dream.

1566
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:11,320
And as for sponsors, you know, if I can be sponsored by
Yorkshire Tea and get some Yorkshire tea every stream,

1567
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,660
that'd be great.

1568
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,040
If I could get free Yorkshire tea, that'd be amazing.

1569
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,380
Yeah, that'd be my pick.

1570
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,140
What about you, Minto?

1571
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,720
It's not Yorkshire.

1572
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:31,940
Yorkshire Shire is like going to the go into the Shire like
the Hobbits That's what I thought it was I'm writing it down

1573
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:42,120
I'm writing it Wait no cheating No there's cheating for
future British quizzes Stop writing it down I erase it from

1574
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:56,140
my brain I would like to try the Yorkshire tea What about
you um i would like to be sponsored by blue archive because

1575
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:06,040
it's my favorite game my favorite uh mobile game i think
it'd be fun um but for a collab

1576
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:21,860
oh okay there's like a there's a there's a cafe in akihabara
called jam akihabara or made And I would like to do a collab

1577
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:25,580
with them where we you could go and get a menu or something.

1578
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,400
Yeah, that'd be so cool That'd be so cool.

1579
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,620
Yeah, densetsu menu.

1580
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,000
I'd love that.

1581
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,680
That's so cool What about you Phoebes?

1582
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:44,360
In terms of getting sponsored, I'm just like I was like I
drink a lot of throat coat and I also have a lot of kpop koa

1583
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,200
So ninjom?

1584
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,380
I don't know

1585
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,200
Yes, please.

1586
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,740
Actually, maybe infold.

1587
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,980
Because I love Infinity Nikki.

1588
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:00,200
And also, my housemates love Love and Deep Space.

1589
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,580
So, I don't really play Love and Deep Space with my
housemate.

1590
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:08,320
We have a giant Raphael cut out in our house.

1591
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:14,500
So if I could get them some free currency for their pulls,
that would be awesome.

1592
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:17,620
But I think...

1593
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,340
Item label.

1594
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:24,680
For me, at least for me, for me, like, item label is a big
one.

1595
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:27,680
I could see us having a whole, like, I don't know if you
guys know item label.

1596
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:30,140
Do either of you two know item label?

1597
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,580
I don't think so.

1598
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:32,120
No.

1599
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,560
It's one of my favorite companies.

1600
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,300
They make peepees and wee-wees and all kinds of little guys.

1601
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,180
Aww.

1602
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:40,500
What?

1603
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,160
Yeah.

1604
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:42,720
I don't know what...

1605
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,580
Pepees, wee-wees, pee-wees.

1606
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,640
Oh, how do I explain?

1607
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,080
Wait.

1608
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,680
It just sounds like different versions of Phoebe.

1609
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,680
Different things I can call you.

1610
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:55,960
It sounds like inappropriate parts.

1611
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:56,880
Oh, I am.

1612
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,300
I got peepees and weewees?

1613
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,300
Two different kinds of people.

1614
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,420
Take a look at my peewees.

1615
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,440
They like make little...

1616
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,320
They have characters.

1617
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:15,840
They're like little cryptid-like characters, and they do
like random boxes, and I'm saving some random boxes for an

1618
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,460
unboxing stream soon.

1619
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,480
I love them.

1620
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:21,840
They're like little cryptids.

1621
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,040
Pee-Pee loves peanuts and he commits crime.

1622
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,680
And then the baby version is called a Wii-Wi-Wi.

1623
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,660
And it doesn't know anything.

1624
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,760
Item label?

1625
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:31,980
This is what they're called?

1626
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,960
Item label, yeah.

1627
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,840
So one of my dreams is to have a collab plush.

1628
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,560
Or like some kind of drop with item label.

1629
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,680
You spell it like Wii-Wi-Wi?

1630
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:42,700
Is it like, are they French?

1631
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:43,340
Yeah.

1632
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,640
Like
Wii-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-WiWiWi-WiWiWi-Wi.

1633
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,540
Oh, they look like furbies.

1634
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:50,080
Oh no.

1635
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,100
Yeah, they look kind of like furbies, don't they?

1636
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:52,880
Oh no.

1637
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:53,920
They're legally distinct.

1638
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,480
Oh, okay.

1639
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:55,840
Oh no.

1640
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:56,740
I'm loving.

1641
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,200
They look like beefies.

1642
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:04,700
And there's like diglets and mons and dinkles and sucklets.

1643
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,600
They're amazing homies.

1644
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:08,860
How many are there?

1645
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,380
Well, anyway, if you love them, Phoebe, then we love them
too.

1646
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:13,980
Oh, thank you.

1647
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,240
Yeah.

1648
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,480
I hope that you will come to really love them.

1649
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,660
And then you'll understand.

1650
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,240
And you'll also want to collab.

1651
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,780
and sponsorship with them too.

1652
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:21,960
Yeah!

1653
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:22,480

You're right, you're right.

1657

1658
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:31,580

Five?

1684
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,820
Oh, I think it's just three actually.

1685
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,380
I think it's three rather than five.

1686
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,280
So you're lucky.

1687
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:38,480
One, two, three.

1688
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,060
Wait, that's funny.

1689
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:41,980
She keeps going back the same amount of spaces she traveled.

1690
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,220
Wait, no, I thought it was...

1691
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,180
Wait, did I typo?

1692
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,320
No, it says five spaces.

1693
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,060
Oh, it says five?

1694
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,720
Okay, that's very honest of you.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

1709
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,840
I mean, I feel like it's the contents inside, right?

1710
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,620
That's the important part anyways.

1711
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:11,300
You know?

1712
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,080

Yeah, yeah.

1714
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,440
It's just because it's like so...

1715
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,460
Well, it broke a little bit in Last Transit.

1716

I'm very excited to see it.

1721
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,300
And I'm excited to play Metal Gear too.

1722
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,360
I'm excited for you to teach me all about it.

1723
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,660
I'm going to definitely play you at some point.

1724
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:01,260
Yeah, I'm going to play.

1725
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:01,840
I'm going to play.

1726
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:03,720
I want to try.

1727
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,200
Okay, do I play or do I just watch Vicky's playthrough
event, I wonder?

1728
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,260
Neither.

1729
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,940
Yeah, you could play together.

1730
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:10,720
Yeah.

1731
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,980
Actually, that could be a thing.

1732
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:14,300
It could be.

1733
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,000
I mean, to be fair, I'm awful at like stealth games, so you
might need to help me to be honest.

1734
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:27,680
the stealth parts Legend of Zelda Wind Waker taught me a lot
about stealth or Zelda games and gel taught me about stealth

1735
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:34,020
I like how you said the stealth parts when the whole game is
a stealth game so basically I don't think I'm going to be

1736
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:48,020

01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,240
Oh, yeah!

1747
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,160

Yeah, Ocondor Pasa!

1753
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,020
Ocondor Pasa, so cute!

1754
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,740
Yeah, she's so cute.

1755
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:48,060
She was my first favorite, so I still have a, like, a soft
spot for her.

1756
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,600
Wait, so is it Mejino McQueen?

1757
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:57,260
the queen has she overthrown has the queen overthrown

saying something's delicious like umah umahend What about
you, Phoebe?

1760
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,800
It's really hard for me to...

1761
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,900
I honestly think my number one favorite is still Rice
Shower.

1762
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,440
But real close seconds are...

1763
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:33,940
I actually really, really like and relate to Smart Falcon.

1764
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:36,400
And then, of course, I love Haru Udara.

1765
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,040
She's a really close second, too.

1766
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:38,780
Ah, Haru Udara.

1767
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:40,180
And then...

1768
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,420
Everyone says that I'm like Nishino Flower, but she's not...

1769
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:51,020
in the game yet so i don't really know her that well um but
maybe she'll become a she'll come up there too i'm sure she

1770
01:32:51,020 --> 01:33:02,800

baby i'm saving a slot for her ah so sweet i like i like

avoided going back just a i think vicky number one actually

1775
01:33:52,720 --> 01:34:04,860
came yeah i hope so i hope so um okay any chance of doing
some vocaloid covers question to the group?

1776
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:07,660
I think so.

1777
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:09,540
Yeah, we were all nodding.

1778
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,400
Never say never, you know.

1779
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,240
We'll probably do lots of different kinds of covers.

1780
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:14,760
So, yeah.

1781
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:17,480
I think we all grew up on Vocaloid too.

1782
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,740
So, we have a lot of possibilities.

1783
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,860
There's just so many songs I want to sing with you guys.

1784
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,440
I feel like there's a lot of Vocaloid songs we can do, you
know?

1785
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:31,240
Do you guys have a favorite Vocaloid song that you'd like to
cover as a group or you'd like to cover yourself?

1786
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,080
Well, I see a lot.

1787
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:38,180
A lot of people, some people were saying triple baka when we
started teasing.

1788
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,880
Oh, yeah, that's right!

1789
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,960
Come on, come on, come on!

1790
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:43,380
Oh!

1791
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,420
That would be fun!

1792
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:47,540
That would be so fun!

1793
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,140
It's so our energy as well, that song isn't it?

1794
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,800
We should, like, create a channel where we just suggest
putting songs that we want to cover together so we can

1795
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,080
always reference back to it.

1796
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:57,700
Yeah!

1797
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,380
Yeah!

1798
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,880
It's a good idea.

1799
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:04,600
Watch, we're gonna go to the server and then they're gonna
have already made that channel for us.

1800
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,100
I don't know why I sound like a chicken then.

1801
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:10,100
Anyway, minto!

1802
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:14,060
Three!

1803
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:15,080
Three!

1804
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:16,820
I'm back where I...

1805
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,660
Three!

1806
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:19,180
Three!

1807
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,980
Back where you were before!

1808
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:22,860
Awesome!

1809
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:24,200
Yeah!

1810
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:25,980
Doggy doggy.

1811
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:33,320
Would you consider playing or singing songs of Project Six
Man?

1812
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,880
There's a lot of like Vocaloid fan.

1813
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,200
Yeah, lots of Vocaloid people.

1814
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,620
Singing songs of Project Sekai together in the future.

1815
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:46,080
I think if Momo Jump was real, they would definitely be your
co-hies.

1816
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,700
Do you guys have some more like background on this?

1817
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,360
Because I haven't played Project Sekai.

1818
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,380
I've always been interested to try, but...

1819
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,560
I love...

1820
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,040
I love Nui Eji idols by more and more Jump.

1821
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,680
I could see us singing something like that.

1822
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:04,060
I don't play it either, but I know so many of the Sayu in it
that I check out the song.

1823
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:04,940
sometimes.

1824
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,400
Yeah, Ogurayui's in more and more jump.

1825
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:08,880
We love Ogurayui.

1826
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:09,780
She is.

1827
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:10,180
She is.

1828
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:11,700
She's like the main girl, Nuri.

1829
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:12,920
Oh, wait.

1830
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,500
I think I did, though, that I...

1831
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:14,940
Yeah.

1832
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,040
I forgot.

1833
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:16,900
Yeah.

1834
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:18,460
I just don't play it.

1835
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,360
I've always wanted to try it.

1836
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:21,960
So maybe this is my opportunity.

1837
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,500
I will check it out.

1838
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,860
Thank you very much for your question.

1839
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,080
And final roll.

1840
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,080
Will Phoebe get...

1841
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,820
Like, 25.

1842
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,060
Roll all three.

1843
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,560
and then add them together.

1844
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:36,560
Really?

1845
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:37,160
Really?

1846
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,780
Yeah, for some extra drama.

1847
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:39,500
Okay, here we go.

1848
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,880
Oh, my God!

1849
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:42,940
13!

1850
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:44,460
13!

1851
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:46,520
Done.

1852
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:55,500
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve.

1853
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,000
Oh, well, that's nice.

1854
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,540
You guys love the same spot.

1855
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,020
Oh.

1856
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:04,500
That's so nice.

1857
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,340
Why do I feel like crying for real right now?

1858
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:07,900
Aww.

1859
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:10,160
I'm so happy.

1860
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,280
It was fate.

1861
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:13,660
It was fate.

1862
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:14,780
It was fate.

1863
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:15,340
It was fate.

1864
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:15,680
It was both.

1865
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,040
It was definitely fate, you guys.

1866
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:23,300
And you guys can do, you guys are both the same place and
you can do the Batsu game that I have prepared together.

1867
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:24,300
Wait, wait.

1868
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,500
You already have something that you already know.

1869
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:26,980
Wow.

1870
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,880
You were the one that didn't want a Batsu game.

1871
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:29,340
I know.

1872
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:30,660
What was this for?

1873
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,180
Stop!

1874
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,060

Perfect.

It's going to be great.

1892
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,220
It's going to be great.

1893
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,680
And with that, we have the winner announcement.

1894

The winner is me!

1895
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,260
And your Batsu game, guys.

1896
01:38:52,480 --> 01:39:01,920
Next time you are both on holiday in Japan, I have some very
nice omiyage that I bought recently at the Wasabi Farm.

1897
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,680
It's a wasabi long the shab biscuits.

1898
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,700
I thought, oh, they might be nice.

1899
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,880
There wasabi and white chocolate combined together.

1900
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,460
They taste like some kind of funky weird cheese.

1901
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,760
They're like the, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.

1902
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,940
They're like, they're really, really bad guys.

1903
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,720
So you're gonna have to eat one of those each.

1904
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:23,300
No!

1905
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:25,980
Are you sure?

1906
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:28,680
I'm holding your, I'm holding your, your shadows hostage.

1907
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:29,900
No!

1908
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:31,780
No, give me my shadows!

1909
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,560
No!

1910
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,220
We'll make a deal.

1911
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:36,860
We'll bargain.

1912
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:37,580
We'll bargain.

1913
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:39,560
I'll...

1914
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:40,600
I'll actually...

1915
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,980
I kind of want to try it, though.

1916
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:43,260
I kind of want to...

1917
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:44,360
You said it's like cheese.

1918
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:45,480
I like cheese.

1919
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,860
No, no, but bad, bad cheese.

1920
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,040
Like, cheese has gone off in the back of the fridge.

1921
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,040
Like...

1922
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,600
Oh, the back of the cheese fridge.

1923
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:53,140
Bad.

1924
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,240
Yeah, it's...

1925
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,260
It ain't good, Phoebe.

1926
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:56,060
But it...

1927
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:56,920
Is it spicy?

1928
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,000
No, not really.

1929
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:00,660
It was just a weird combination.

1930
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:01,720
I thought it would be nice.

1931
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:08,480

What are we doing?

1939
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,320
What are we doing?

1940
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:42,200
What are we doing?

1941
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:42,660
What are we doing?

1942
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:43,340
Yeah, it's a good question.

1943
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:44,840
Which one are we doing first?

1944
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,340
Someone tell me.

1945
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:48,740

1946
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,440
We were gonna do the...

1947
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:49,540
We were gonna do the...

1948
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,920
Well, we're gonna do the...

1949
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:54,700
Wait, should we do the video first or the song?

1950
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:56,160
Yeah, I think the video.

1951
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,380
I think the video.

1952
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:57,480
I think the video.

1953
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,040
Oh, oh, oh, you're right.

1954
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,620
Sorry, I forgot about...

1955
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:01,220
I forgot.

1956
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,360
Don't forget!

1957
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,140
Don't forget.

1958
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,160
Um, yeah.

1959
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,660
I think the video, the video.

1960
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:14,000
Everybody wanting to learn more about Densitude EXE, we will
talk more about it.

1961
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:17,700
After this, messages.

1962
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:18,740
After these messages.

1963
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:19,820
Yeah, these messages.

1964
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:20,820
These messages.

1965
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:22,820
A sneaky video.

1966
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:25,460
Alright, see you guys in a bit.

1967
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:26,420
Doza!

1968
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,860
I'm sorry guys, but the chicken flavor definitely wins.

1969
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:19,300
I'm sorry guys, but the chicken flavor definitely wins.

1970
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,420
No way.

1971
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,700
The shrimp flavor is peak.

1972
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,320
I don't know.

1973
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:27,540
I think the beef is really tasty.

1974
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:36,540
I still can't believe how much we actually have in common.

1975
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:37,580
Right?

1976
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:39,980
Plus, we're the dream team!

1977
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,680
A yurei, a yokai and a yosei...

1978
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,760
its cafe has been so lively ever since.

1979
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:50,400
And how we all came together because we wanted to form an
idol group?

1980
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,280
It has to be fate.

1981
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:53,860
I just know it.

1982
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:03,720
Do you guys really think we can stop this place from being
demolished?

1983
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,260
It's gonna take a lot of work, but if we stick to the plan,
I know we can save it.

1984
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,140
Right, Phoebe?

1985
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:10,780
Mm-hmm.

1986
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:17,220
From my time as a solo idol, I have learned that you can
accomplish anything with enough determination.

1987
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:23,380
It'll lead into our paychecks for a while, but it's a small
price to pay to bring this place back.

1988
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,140
Don't worry about it, Mint.

1989
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:30,480
This once-thriving May Cafe in the heart of Akihabara will
live again.

1990
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,040
Then let's give it everything we got!

1991
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:34,700
Yeah!

1992
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:39,540
Sunday!

1993
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,380
Tonight's the big night.

1994
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,280
You guys ready?

1995
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:46,220
I'm working on closing the cafe right now.

1996
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,420
I'm so nervous.

1997
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,080
Excited, nervous!

1998
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,100
I'll be leaving work soon too.

1999
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:54,240
I'm so excited!

2000
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:55,140
Good.

2001
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:58,040
Let's make sure to channel all of that into our show.

2002
01:43:58,620 --> 01:43:58,960
Yay!

2003
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,580
Running there right now!

2004
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:09,720
And in recent news, there have been growing concerns over
more missing persons in the Akihabara area.

2005
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:13,520
Four more people have suddenly vanished without a trace.

2006
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:20,760
Officials are advising individuals to remain indoors as much
as possible, especially during the evening.

2007
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,540
I'm your blossoming fairy, Sidi.

2008
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,340
Don't lose your head.

2009
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:52,020
I'm your yokai princess, Victoria Roman.

2010
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,120
My, my boo!

2011
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:57,080
I'm your haunting ghost maid and maid phantom!

2012
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,060
And together we are...

2013
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:01,500
Yure!

2014
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,980
Yokeai, you!

2015
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,180
Me?

2016
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,300
Be a part of our story!

2017
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:10,740
We are Tencent to Goi EXP!

2018
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:33,450
We

2019
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,400
are so cooked!

2020
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:43,180
The whole moon has been saved.

2021
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,860
How'd you guys find it?

2022
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,300
Did you like it?

2023
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:55,420
Oh my gosh, we're your Akiba Protector's Densetsu Yaxi!

2024
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:55,940
Yay!

2025
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:04,840
We wanted to just be an idol group, but it seems that
someone has to defeat some evil force that's going through

2026
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:05,680
Akihaburo right now.

2027
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,720
So we took on an extra piece of our job description.

2028
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:11,640
Yeah, just a little bit.

2029
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,000
Just a little bit.

2030
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:13,700
Just a bit.

2031
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:14,620
Hmm.

2032
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,800
Idol demon hunters.

chibi.

2173
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,060
Oh, you go first.

2174
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:13,060
I don't know where to start.

2175
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:13,800
I don't know where to start.

2176
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:15,540
No, I just...

2177
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:17,480
My favorite bit, I have so...

2178
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:25,980
many favorite bits um in in this in this song i i love it i
truly love it so much um but my favorite bit is definitely

2179
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:33,000
the bit that leads between our different types of singing
voices so you've got yes the swing uh kind of like jazzy

2180
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:39,980
jazzy bit with me yeah because we all know how much you know
i'm in the red dress doing that jazz it's like chef's kiss

2181
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:48,900
you know uh and you know and then I've got me doing kind of
Enka rock style and then Phoebe with the kind of Fujikaze

2182
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:51,460
style R&B coming in there.

2183
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:58,160
I feel like that shows our personalities so well and that's
definitely my favorite bit.

2184
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:05,640
I also love the call and response parts and I just, I can't
wait to do it live with you guys too, you know?

2185
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:06,140
Right!

2186
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:12,460
And then Anika, thank you very, very, very much.

2187
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:10,220
I mean, I feel like a lot of our favorite parts, I mean, the
whole thing is very good.

2188
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:19,880
The melody is very, very, very, very, very, very And there
were a few things that we really, really wanted to have in

2189
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:20,220
the song.

2190
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:29,940
One of them was, like, as per a lot of DEMPA songs, a lot
of, like, crazy kind of, like, changes within the song,

2191
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:34,520
whether it's Campo changes, key changes, genre, even
freaking genre changes.

2192
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:41,540
The genre changing part feels so, like, both cohesive and
it, like, showcases all of our, like, individual strengths,

2193
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:41,680
too.

2194
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:48,780
And I think that's something really, truly beautiful about
our group that Aneta-san was able to like capture so well.

2195
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:54,340
By the way, I have something a little bit more about the
demo Aneta-san sent us to say in a little bit.

2196
02:02:54,680 --> 02:03:02,480
But like, really, we're all so different and yet similar to
each other.

2197
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:04,020
We're all very, very unique.

2198
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:09,600
And yet we are united under a single shining dream.

2199
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:20,140
grateful that I get to chase my dreams now with such
precious friends and talented collaborators and Anita San

2200
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:28,820
really like captured that a lot in fact it was funny because
in the demo that he sent us he actually had like sung it

2201
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:36,320
himself and then formatted his voice to like sound a little
bit more feminine but then you could tell that he had

2202
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,940
specifically you could tell which parts were meant for who?

2203
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:41,240
For which person?

2204
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:50,460
even though it was just like placeholder lyrics at the time
because he sung he like tried to mimic each of us yeah there

2205
02:03:50,460 --> 02:04:00,000
was a part the original the original talking part that was
like victoria no man or something like that honestly could

2206
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:09,580
release the secret anna to sand version i'd loop that it's
so good his voice is actually amazing i love his voice but

2207
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:12,340
um something i want point out real quick.

2208
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

2209
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:15,640
You guys need to shut me up because I can talk.

2210
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:16,420
I'm going to talk about it.

2211
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:16,920
Talk!

2212
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:17,540
Talk!

2213
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Talk!

2214
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:19,400
Yeah!

2215
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,140
In the talking section.

2216
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:24,160
Why do I feel like I'm going to cry?

2217
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:24,940
Why do I...

2218
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:26,040
In the talking section.

2219
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,080
Something really cool.

2220
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:31,240
When I get really excited, I stop being able to breathe.

2221
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:31,620
Hold on.

2222
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:38,420
In the talking section, there are solos playing in the
background.

2223
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:45,280
Instrument solos going in the background of each of are like
talking parts but anita san changes the solo and also

2224
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:52,140
changes the instrument playing it playing in each section
too so vicky has like a a piano solo and minto has like this

2225
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:58,180
like a guitar synth thing going on and then i have like a i
need to go back and listen to it but you would have to

2226
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:02,720
listen to the instrument i think you have the guitar synth i
think i have a saxophone you have a sack yeah you have a

2227
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:07,540
saxophone i have like a guitar synth vicky has a piano and
they're they each sound a little different so there's like

2228
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:15,560
little like shimmery fairy sounds in my part and then in
Vicky's part it's like wow like that yeah that's actually

2229
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:28,600
our voices yeah do you guys like a wow um very yokai like
and then spooky little spooky little mental sounds and so

2230
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:35,020
it's really like but it all comes together so cohesively
right like it doesn't sound like a mess at all so it's like

2231
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:44,940
there's a there's a yeah like our three colors will light
the stage three very distinct colors all coming together to

2232
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:56,360
make something beautiful that's us that is the essence of
densetsu.exe right there right there oh freebie also i want

2233
02:05:56,360 --> 02:06:02,460
to say too like we did all write the lyrics together in some
way but i think phoebe did most of it so thank you phoebe

2234
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,900
yeah thank you phoebe

2235
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:11,140
I think I got a little too gung-ho.

2236
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:15,580
I ended up writing lyrics for the entire song.

2237
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:21,680
And I was like, I hope they don't feel like I'm being bossy,
like coming in and having a full draft.

2238
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:25,280
Because we were like, we're going to meet at this time,
collaborate on the lyrics.

2239
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:28,460
But basically what happened was I brought it.

2240
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,280
And then you guys changed some parts.

2241
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:35,140
And like, you know, the parts where you did the solos with
the genres and stuff.

2242
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:36,420
You changed a little bit of that.

2243
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:46,600
like give you a nice touch to it but i i i was a little
worried at first actually i was like oh i hope i'm not

2244
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:53,640
forced i really hope i'm not forcing no it was just that no
your ideas were we looked at them we were like that's

2245
02:06:53,640 --> 02:07:05,120
perfect yeah exactly yeah i think yeah what's also insane is
just how little time we had to put this all together we we

2246
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:16,340
basically we received the song like and then we but that was
like the weekend that um mint and i were doing things for us

yeah rush of just everything so um but yeah it was just it

2248

that um anita san wrote for us as well yeah we were just so

2249
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:44,680

should we could get like a translation of them and include

2250
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:54,280
it with the lyrics so people that would be a nice idea yeah
so um it you know i've never written lyrics before so i came

I want everything, but this one.

2401
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:36,940
This one.

2402
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:38,060
Yeah, this one is our favorite.

2403
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:39,840
Oh, what is that?

2404
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:41,000
What is that?

2405
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:42,200
What is that?

2406
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:43,500
What is that?

2407
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:44,820
Oh, my God.

2408
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:49,300
No one expected.

2409
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:50,880
No one expected.

2410
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:55,100
What is that?

2411
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:56,220
What is that?

2412
02:17:56,220 --> 02:17:57,660
Yeah, what could it be?

2413
02:17:58,020 --> 02:17:58,640
I think I read.

2414
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:00,840
recognize the back of those heads, I think.

2415
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:07,020
Yeah, they look very, very like I've seen them somewhere
before, you know?

2416
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:08,440
Something about them.

2417
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:10,180
I gotta see the front!

2418
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:11,460
You gotta show me!

2419
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:12,640
I gotta see it now!

2420
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:23,980
This special little headband that you can customize with the
three of us, as well as we will be selling the, just the

2421
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:24,280
heads.

2422
02:18:24,820 --> 02:18:30,020
So, you could create a headband full of Vicky!

2423
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:35,240
Oh, our Phoebe, full of Vito, or just full of all three of
us all together.

2424
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,280
Or you can just walk around your house.

2425
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,360
Or you could just get the head.

2426
02:18:39,480 --> 02:18:40,800
You could put it on your belt.

2427
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:42,640
You could put it on your shoulder.

2428
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:44,220
Let's collect our heads.

2429
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:45,300
Yeah.

2430
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:46,680
Yeah.

2431
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:47,820
Do it.

2432
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,360
I'm going to yeet my Vickies out of the window.

2433
02:18:50,780 --> 02:18:52,160
At random passes by.

2434
02:18:52,220 --> 02:18:54,060
No, I'm not going to do that, but you could do anything you
want.

2435
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:55,200
They would be so honored.

2436
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:56,180
They'd be like, no way.

2437
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:57,260
Victoria Roman.

2438
02:18:58,260 --> 02:18:58,900
From the sky.

2439
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:02,040
Come on, just the hedge.

2440
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:10,320
And it's, you know, a dream for us to do live shows together
at some point and that sort of thing.

2441
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:16,540
And if we're doing a live show, you know, what do you need
if you're doing a live show as a fan?

2442
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:19,480
Yes.

2443
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:20,460
You need the heads.

2444
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:21,380
Also.

2445
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:22,100
You need the heads.

2446
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:23,280
Don't lose your head.

2447
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:25,880
Also, what do we need?

2448
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:27,940
I'm happy.

2449
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,240

I've been also very grateful.

2513
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:50,380
It's been a long time since I've been in an idol group.

2514
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:52,060
And...

2515
02:22:52,060 --> 02:22:53,020

But like...

2520
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,180

2521
02:22:59,180 --> 02:23:03,520
I didn't think that I would find people that I like resonate
with on this level.

2522
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:04,780
Ever.

2523

I was like, I'm just gonna do solo idol stuff forever.

2524
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:08,400
But...

2525
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:09,920
It was very lonely.

2526
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:11,120
I was lonely.

2527
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:15,860
