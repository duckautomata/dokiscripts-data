1
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

2
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,490
Hello, hello.

3
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,230
Hi.

4
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,610
Hello, hello.

5
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm nervous.

6
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:07,210
I choose karaoke streams to make me less nervous sometimes,
but then also the karaoke stream itself makes me nervous.

7
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,460
This is a dollar for every night that I've listened to you
sing, Harvest Moon.

8
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Should I sing it tonight as well, even though it's not the
Harvest Moon?

9
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,520
Today, I've chosen a little bit more of a chilly vibe.

10
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,060
Thank you!

11
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,240
Thank you.

12
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,360
Remember that time you did karaoke to calm your nerves
before Big Dana worked out like that?

13
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:48,460
actually I know but I get nervous for the karaoke too I

14
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,140

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,170
This one's open.

19
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,490
I have so many things for my throat.

20
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,770
Thank you so much for the 50 gift and thank you!

21
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,670

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,660
Invisible Moose, thank you so much for the 20 here today,
Kube.

31
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,720
It's weird.

32
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,080
things like this are so strange.

33
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,040
Like, planning stuff.

34
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:46,040
It's always like, and this doesn't just go for, like,
VTubers, but, like, Oh my gosh, Dermatio, thank you so much

35
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,940
for the 50.

36
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you!

37
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,980
Oh, that's right.

38
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,820
Oh, chat froze.

39
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,880
Why does it keep happening?

40
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,580
And freeze!

41
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,820
There we go.

42
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,880
Oh, wrong chat.

43
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,420
Oh my gosh, I just realized.

44
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,320
I think it's the... I think I was practicing.

45
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,600
I think that is the debut chat.

46
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,280
That's so funny.

47
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,120
Oops.

48
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,820
I just didn't even question... Ah, there you guys are.

49
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,260
I didn't even question it.

50
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:31,440
oopsie but um you know when you're like this is like for
projects for anything you know you like spend all this time

51
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:44,100
prepping and all this time stressing and all this time
preparing and then as soon as it comes it's over in like you

52
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:52,420
know for me it'll be over in an hour and it's like all this
and for me it's also weird because like

53
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,340
Phoebe's changing a couple things Vicky is straight up
debuting but for me not much is changing so I'm like why am

54
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:15,160
I nervous not much is really changing for me I guess you
know the sound of saying debut or it's like the start of

55
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,240
something new in a sense because it's the start of the three
of us together but

56
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:33,580
but in terms of like streaming and stuff nothing's gonna
change you're gonna make a lot of fans pregnant tomorrow

57
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:41,560
tomorrow why i'm seeing sweet caroline sweet caroline

58
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,260
It happens.

59
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,740
You are about to start a new journey.

60
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,180
I guess that's kind of true.

61
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,920
That is kind of true.

62
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,360
Not kind of.

63
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,960
It is true.

64
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,340
I mean, it is the start of something new.

65
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,080
We're gonna do our best with it.

66
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,720
You're nervous because it's going to be awesome!

67
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,780
And you're always nervous before awesome things.

68
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,260
I...

69
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,340
I...

70
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,600
You know, I have a few new things prepared.

71
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,220
A few new things to kind of make it a little bit shinier.

72
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:33,500
For the most part, I didn't want to make it seem all new,
because, you know, like I said, for the most part, things

73
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,980
will be staying the same.

74
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,360
So, make today a graduation stream.

75
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:41,960
No!

76
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,520
You guys would kill me!

77
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,140
I'm already dead!

78
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,240
And you would be like...

79
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,000
You would be like...

80
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,810
But, um...

81
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,130
Yeah, where's the white background and the smiling and the
slight breeze in my hair?

82
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,850
And our little hearts.

83
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,830
I don't even want to joke about stuff like that, so.

84
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,770
Excited for it.

85
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,250
Have fun.

86
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,810
Yeah, we'll just have fun.

87
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,730
Minto karaoke before Denza 2.exe.

88
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,290
You're spoiling us.

89
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,610
MVP.

90
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,810
Yeah, MVP.

91
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,910
Please know.

92
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,090
No, no, no, I'm not.

93
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,730
Densetsu.exe, does that make...

94
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,890
Densu.exe, does that make...

95
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,430
Mint the ghost in the machine?

96
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:41,910
Ah!

97
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,470
The shorts you guys have been releasing and build up to
tomorrow's debut had me dying of laughter.

98
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,930
A lot of the shorts, basically...

99
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,310
Oh my gosh.

100
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,050
I feel like we should release an extended cut or something
because the shorts are all basically...

101
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,790
Most of them are taken from one...

102
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,750
session.

103
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:10,690
The three of us kind of met up and then just like talked for
like an hour or something.

104
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,910
Minto was always an idol, but soon more will know.

105
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,390
I don't know.

106
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,570
Yeah, a lot of stuff was cut out.

107
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,610
Um, it felt like a podcast.

108
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,970
Yeah, we were just like, we were just chatting about
everything and anything.

109
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,990
We were just like,

110
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,210
Oh!

111
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,930
Oh my gosh, before I start singing, can I show you guys
something?

112
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,610
I can finally show you this, which is kind of crazy.

113
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,090
Hold on.

114
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:47,090
I can finally maybe satisfy some curious folks.

115
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,810
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for all the super chats, you
guys.

116
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,270
Thank you, Shiny Dears.

117
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,090
I should start writing things down, huh?

118
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

119
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,450
Release the Minto cut.

120
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,750
Thank you so much.

121
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,490
Okay, hold on.

122
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,370
Not the wet wang.

123
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,910
so there was a collab bond

124
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:19,150
yes okay all right here we go this might look familiar to
some of you all hopefully all of you so i hope all of you

125
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:32,830
watch this oh wait hold on whoa familiar familiar right some
of you might have i saw a few comments some people noticed

126
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,970
that there was a point of silence.

127
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,930
Oh my god.

128
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,790
Spooked, man.

129
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:46,910
Oh, nope.

130
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,390
Not yet.

131
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,770
Wait, there we go.

132
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,730
I can satisfy all your curiosity.

133
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,370
I actually had to censor that, or I had to silence that
manually.

134
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:16,130
Once again, changed locations and I got to sing with my
favorite girlies.

135
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:24,230
ever phoebe and vicky thank you guys did the two exe yeah
that's it i

136
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,180
was like we were stressing actually we were high key
stressing we were like they were like you have to cut the

137
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:57,300
song and i was like i can't cut the song and so ultimately
it i felt so terrible ultimately it it made it so that vicky

138
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:08,200
would like like and everything early, like, it was, it was,
it was, we were like, what do we do?

139
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,700
What do we do?

140
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,460
Because we were like, do we keep it a secret?

141
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,600
Like, super secret until, until everything do, we had to,
all because of that.

142
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,420
Literally all because of the song.

143
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,280
And then I was like, well, I can't cut the MC afterwards.

144
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,780
Like, it wouldn't make sense.

145
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,980
But then I don't know.

146
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,860
So.

147
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:40,180
We kind of figured out, as you see what happened, that's
kind of how we decided to do it.

148
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,300
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Vicky.

149
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,040
I think she was okay with it, though.

150
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,440
I think she had a lot of fun making all of her videos and
everything.

151
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,040
Calling Din Setsu Da Ixia 3A.

152
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm not clickbait.

153
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,980
Where can I see that cover?

154
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,260
That's a great question.

155
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,440
You can see that cover in my 3D debut.

I was like, I bought this for you.

164

And then she was like, oh my gosh, I've seen these before on
TikTok.

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,500
People will cut off his limbs and then fill it with water
and watch him expand.

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,860

175
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240

205
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,100
the spring.

206
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,260
And spring became the summer.

207
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,740
Who'd I believe you'd come along?

208
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,140
Touching hands.

209
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,980
Reaching out.

Breadbread.

214
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:18,720
Breadbread.

215
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,660
The times never seem so good, so good, so good!

216
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:43,810
I've been inclined, bread, bread, bread To believe they
never would, but Look at the night And it don't seem so

217
00:21:43,810 --> 00:22:01,530
lonely We fill it up with only two the bread thing after

Bread, bread, bread.

So good.

226
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:46,090
I've been inclined to believe they never would.

227
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,790
Oh, no.

228
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,580
Oh my gosh.

229
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,600
I wonder if we could even find karaoke versions a lot.

230
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,420
Sweet Caroline, ba ba ba, the dance never seems so good.

231
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,200

And go!

234
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:21,680
Sweet Caroline, I believe they never could.

235
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:35,080
Caroline The dance never seemed so good So good, yeah

236
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,100
I forgot to ask How was the audio?

237
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,780
How was the sound on that?

238
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,360
I was just like using it as a test song And I got so into it
I forgot to test if it was too loud or not

239
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,020
It was good?

240
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:10,160
Okay, good, good, good Okay, so Hugh Jackman played he's he
is in a maybe it's released now i don't know an upcoming

241
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:19,000
maybe question mark movie about neil diamond or a guy no a
guy that played an impersonator of neil diamond i'm so

242
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:29,180
confused the song was the song my family sang my grandma for
her birthday oh so sweet huge jacked man name.

243
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Yeah.

244
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,120
And Hugh Jackman played the guy.

245
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,080
Oh, gosh.

246
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,620
Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean Valjean in Le Maze.

247
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,860
And, and the way he sings is very, like, specific.

248
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,560
Jean Valjean.

249
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,100
Yeah, Jean Valjean.

250
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,920
And, oh, prisoner six, two, eight, oh, one.

251
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:13,640
why should we sing some lemmas but um so because Hugh
Jackman has this very specific way of singing and he sings

252
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:23,500
sweet Caroline he's like sweet Caroline and there's like
this guy who sorry this is like the most convoluted

253
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:31,360
explanation ever but there's this guy who does like parody
videos of Hugh of like like pretending or acting like he's

254
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:40,320
or singing like how Hugh Jackman sings and then replaces the
lyrics to songs with bread because that's what happened in

255
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:50,300
Le Messe is Jean Valjean got arrested because he stole a
loaf of bread and so as a bass singer that song is like what

256
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,000
do I go to it's really it's like such a hype song everybody
knows sweet Caroline

257
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,200
And he's like, I stole a loaf of bread.

258
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,840
It's so funny.

259
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,040
The way he sings is so specific.

260
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,560
I stole a loaf of bread.

261
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,900
Okay, oh gosh, my brain rot is very multi-layered.

262
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,880
Yes, yes, indeed.

263
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,660
Francis Hardcore, man.

264
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,540
I don't know.

265
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,060
Do you hear the purple sing?

266
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,380
Singing the song.

267
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,740
What is that one?

268
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,720
I don't even know.

269
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,500
I could sing.

270
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,640
What is a L'Ameselable song?

271
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,640
Um.

272
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,240
Song of Angry Bread.

273
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,100
Sing on my own.

274
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,680
Okay.

275
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,920
I'll sing.

276
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:08,620
that wait that's such a it's i feel like it matches the
vibes of my sad winter setup

277
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:34,120
and now i'm all alone again nowhere to turn no one to go to
without a hope without a friend without a face to say hello

278
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:47,840
to but now the night is near now i can make wait oh gosh
sometimes i walk alone at night when everybody else is

279
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:59,740
sleeping i think of him and then i'm happy with the company
wait what's the what's the note here the city goes to bed

280
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,540
and i can live inside my head

281
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:35,660
on my own pretending he beside me all alone I walk with him
till morning without him I feel his arms around me and when

282
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:54,700
I close wait let's wait I've said the wrong word in the rain
the pavement shines like silver all the lights are misty in

283
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:12,980
the river in the darkness the trees are full of starlight
and all I see is him and me forever and forever and I I know

284
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:25,200
it's only in my mind that I'm talking to myself and not to
him.

285
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:39,920
And although I know that he is blind, still I say there's a
way for us.

286
00:29:42,200 --> 00:30:00,440
I love him, but when the night is over He is gone, the river
is just a river Without him, the world around me changes The

287
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:13,120
trees are barren everywhere, the streets are full of
strangers I love him, but every day I'm learning All my

288
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:27,740
life, I've only been pretending Without me, his world will
go on turning A world that's full of happiness that I have

289
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,000
never known

290
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:51,910
I love him I love him Solid snake I love snake But only
on...

291
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,020
The self-insert.

292
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,860
Yeah, sorry.

293
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,700
Got a little carried away there.

294
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,000
Let me... I also realized I forgot to turn off...

295
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,580
I haven't heard one, but I forgot to turn off sounds for the
doughnuts.

296
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,000
So let me...

297
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,140
Do that real quickly.

298
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,020
One moment.

299
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:43,580
I don't even know if one has shown up or not.

300
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,600
I don't know if they're like buried beneath a bunch of
stuff.

301
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,420
Minto sounds like a princess?

302
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,100

chenoweth version um

whenever i see someone less fortunate than i and let's face

313
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,180
it who is Less fortunate than I, my tender heart tends to
start to bleed.

314
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,640
And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take
over.

315
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,940
I know, I know exactly what they need.

316
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:31,440
And even in your case, though it's the toughest case I've
yet to face, Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed.

317
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:50,980
Follow my lead And yes, indeed, you will be popular You're
gonna be popular I'll teach you the proper poise when you

318
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:59,140
talk to boys Little ways to flirt and flounce I'll show you
what shoes to wear How to fix your hair Everything that

319
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,360
really counts to be popular I'll help you be popular.

320
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,840
You'll hang with the right cohorts.

321
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,260
You'll be good at sports.

322
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,720
Know the slang you've got to know.

323
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,520
So let's start because you've got an awfully long way to go.

324
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,280
Don't be offended by my frank analysis.

325
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,060
Think of it as personality dialysis.

326
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,340
Now that I've chosen to become a palisester and advisor,
there's nobody wiser.

327
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,740
Not when it comes to popular.

328
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:40,840
And with an assist from me to be who you'll be Instead of
dreary who you were, well, are There's nothing that can stop

329
00:34:40,840 --> 00:35:00,740
you from becoming popular LAR La la la We're gonna make you
popular When I see depressing creatures With unprepossessing

330
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:12,480
features remind them on their own we have to think of
celebrated heads of state or especially great communicators

331
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:22,040
did they have brains or knowledge don't make me laugh they
were popular right that's my favorite part of the movie

332
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:35,000
version it's not about aptitude it's the way you're viewed
so it's very shrewd to be very very popular like me Oh my

333
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,720
gosh, my Miss Alphaba.

334
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,980
Look at you.

335
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,200
You're beautiful.

336
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,620
Oh, whoa.

337
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,160
I have to go.

338
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,920
There's a lady here.

339
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,860
Oh my gosh.

340
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,920
You're welcome.

341
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:58,240
And though you protest your disinterest, I know
clandestinely.

342
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,980
You're gonna grin and bury your newfound popularity.

343
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,750
La, la, la, you'll be popular.

344
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,690
Just not quite as popular as me.

345
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,450
I forgot to turn on reverb.

346
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,030
Oh my god.

347
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,470
Woman jump scare, woman jump scare.

348
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,210
That's another wicked song.

349
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,930
I forgot to warm up for today's stream, so I apologize in
advance.

350
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,450
My favorite part of karaoke streams is seeing all the great
names go, Make it sing!

351
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:48,690
No!

352
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,780
Is that Glinda?

353
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Look, it's Glinda!

354
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,220
Denny, the reverb?

355
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,860
Thank you.

356
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,420
Thank you.

357
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,360
That's not true.

358
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,660
What a wicked karaoke.

359
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,180
Defying gravity?

360
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:32,620
Galinda Galinda Look it's Galinda Let's see I can try
Defying Gravity I can't Should I I guess the music or the

361
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:39,980
musical version is like what makes the sorry wait I'm I have
a million thoughts right now What is the difference between

362
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,580
the film?

363
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,880
Because it's so much longer.

364
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,760
It's like seven and a half minutes long.

365
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,920
Go, Linda.

366
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,280
Go for it.

367
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,940
Thank you so much for the mic, Kat, and thank you.

368
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,620
I want to hear her sing that note.

369
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,720
The dialogue.

370
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,160
I can, let's see, let's see.

371
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,620
I might have to do both parts.

372
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,040
Oh, gosh.

373
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,400
Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once, instead
of flying off the handle?

374
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,360
I hope you're happy, I hope you're happy now, I hope you're
happy how you hurt your cause forever, I hope you think

375
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:30,480
you're clever, I hope you're happy, I hope you're happy too,
I hope you're proud how you would grovel in submission to

376
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,520
feed your own ambition, so though I can't imagine how,

377
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,500
right now.

378
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,100
I had to add a voice.

379
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,740
Elfie, listen to me.

380
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,560
Just say you're sorry.

381
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:01,840
You can still be with the wizard, what you've worked and
waited for.

382
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,400
You can have all you ever wanted.

383
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,220
I know.

384
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,760
But I don't want it.

385
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,020
I thought there was a cat in my room.

386
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,140
I can't want it anymore.

387
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,320
Oh, I was early, sorry.

388
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,080
Hold on.

389
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,420
My gravity.

390
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,930
Something has changed within me.

391
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,130
The pacing is all different.

392
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,970
It's not what I'm used to.

393
00:39:41,990 --> 00:40:01,230
something is not the same I'm through with playing by the
rules of someone else's game too late for second guessing

394
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:18,470
too late to go back to sleep it's time to trust my instincts
close my eyes it's good and then one and leave it's time to

395
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:36,110
try defying gravity I think I'll try defying gravity and you
can't pull me down can't I make you understand you're having

396
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:47,050
delusions of grandeur I'm through accepting limits it's
slower Someone says they're so Some things I cannot change

397
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:59,890
But till I try I'll never know Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love I guess I've lost Well if that's love It comes

398
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:18,370
at much too high a cost I'd sooner buy Defying gravity Kiss
me good Oh boy, I'm defying gravity And you can't pull me

399
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:24,350
down This is, this is hard Why is it so slow?

400
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:40,050
Think of what we could do together Unlimited Together we're
unlimited Together we'll be the greatest team there's ever

401
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:59,150
been dreams the way we plan them if we work in tandem
there's no fight we cannot win just you and I defying

402
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:12,730
gravity with you and I defying gravity they'll never shut up
they'll bring us down I couldn't remember whose harmonies I

403
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,350
was doing.

404
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,700
Are you coming?

405
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,640
Well, are you guys?

406
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,340
Are you guys?

407
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,800
Are you coming?

408
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
Are you coming?

409
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,220
I hope you're happy.

410
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,300
What is the note here?

411
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,420
Now that you're choosing this, you too.

412
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,100
I hope it brings you bliss.

413
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,740
I really hope you get it and you don't live to regret it.

414
00:42:49,400 --> 00:43:07,120
I hope you're happy in the end I hope you're happy, my
friend No, let her alone!

415
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,940
She hasn't done anything wrong!

416
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm the one you want!

417
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,100
This part's gonna make me laugh!

418
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,900
It's me!

419
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,860
It's me!

420
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,220
Me?

421
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,660
So if you care to find me, let the

422
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,620
one deserve the chance to fly.

423
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,380
And if I'm flying solo, at least I'm flying free.

424
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,460
To those who'd ground me, take a message back from me.

425
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:49,980
Tell them how I'm defying gravity.

426
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:00,580
I am defying the revenue And soon I'll match them in renown

427
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:15,340
I am not suited for Elfaba I'm more suited for Glinda, I
think Unlimited

428
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:33,000
Unlimited Unlimited

429
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:55,130
Oh, nobody in all of us know wizard that there is or was is
ever gonna bring me

430
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,370
down.

431
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:56,370
Did you guys ever see the commercials of Cynthia Arrivo
being like, No, that's my line.

432
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,750
But people would like slow it down.

433
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,530
They'd be like, no, that's my line.

434
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,000
That's all I can think of.

435
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,740
Tarsan.

436
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,340
Oh, gosh.

437
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,420
Hello, by Adele.

438
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,380
The original singer is one of the highest vocal raids on
Broadway.

439
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,500
Oh, Adina Madel, she's, like, insane.

440
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,200
That lady.

441
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,930
Sorry, I was, like, laughing.

442
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,370

443
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,250
I'm so sorry.

444
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,590
Oh, gosh.

445
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,450
I'm still nervous, so it's like...

446
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,490
Oh, gosh, okay.

447
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,770

Okay, what should I sing next?

I kind of want to sing Disney.

455
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,440
Oh, wait.

456
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,000

457
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,080
I think I know what I want to sing.

458
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,600
Okay, wait.

Hold on.

460
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,400
I have to make sure it's the right one.

461
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,380
One second.

462
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,360
Okay, okay.

463
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,560

469
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,860
Okay, wait.

470
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:36,620

472
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,900

I'll sing that one after.

477
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
Actually, maybe I should sing it first.

478
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,860

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,640

M-I-C.

505
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,750
See you real soon!

506
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:02,350
Tell me why.

507
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,910
Why because we like you.

508
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:11,330
M-O-U-S-E.

509
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,570
The ending is so scary.

510
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,130
It's like the...

511
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,630
Why is it such a cursed song?

512
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,170
Oh my god.

513
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,450
I'm sorry.

514
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,760
Okay, I'll sing evermore.

515
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,900
Wait, which is the right version?

516
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,580
I don't remember.

517
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:43,900
I think it's the right version.

518
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,920
I don't think I have to change the...

519
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,900
I always think this.

520
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,340
I'm like, do I have to change the pitch?

521
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,340
The key.

522
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,830
I only wanted to sing the Donald Duck.

523
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,280
I was the one who had it all.

524
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,860
I was the master of my fate.

525
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,560
I never needed anybody in my life.

526
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,580
I learned the truth too late.

527
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,400
I'll never shake away the pain.

528
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,500
I close my eyes but she's still there.

529
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,650
I let her steal into my melancholy heart.

530
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,580
It's more than I can bear.

531
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,560
But now I know she'll never leave.

532
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:19,940
me even as she runs away she will still torment me call me
hurt me move me come what may wasting in my lonely tower

533
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:40,360
waiting by an open door I'll fool myself, she'll walk right
in And be with me forevermore I rage against the trials of

534
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:58,580
love I curse the fading of the light Though she's already
flown so far beyond my reach She's never out of sight Now I

535
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:17,480
know she'll never leave me Even as she fades from view She
will still inspire me Be a part of everything I do Wasting

536
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:35,960
in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door How full myself
she'll walk right in And as the long, long nights begin I'll

537
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:44,180
think of all that might have been Waiting here forever

538
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:02,890
My lung capacity

539
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:07,710
Evermore.

540
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:08,690
Yippee!

541
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:11,990
All I ask of you are...

542
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,030
Twilight!

543
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,410
Wait, what's all I ask of you?

544
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:15,650
Wait.

545
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,590
I feel like I know that one.

546
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,090
Oh!

547
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,250
Phantom?

548
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:24,730
Oh, geez.

549
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,870
Getting all the...

550
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,550
The toughies, huh?

551
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,610
It's not easy being green.

552
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,830
It's not easy being green.

553
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,350
I don't know that song.

554
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,320
Everything's alright from To The Moon.

555
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,860
I didn't learn it yet.

556
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,760
A rainbow connection?

557
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,960
Wait, oh my gosh.

558
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,080
This song is so sweet.

559
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,230
Wait, can I do it as Kermit?

560
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Do I remember this song?

561
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:36,820
Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the
other side?

562
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:48,880
Rainbows are visions but only illusions and rainbows have
nothing to hide.

563
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:57,060
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.

564
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,960
I know they're wrong, wait and see.

565
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,260
Someday we'll find it.

566
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,900
The rainbow connection.

567
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,320
The lovers, the dreamers, and the frogberg.

568
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,170
Who said every wish is true?

569
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:39,250
Would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that And someone believed it Look what

570
00:58:39,250 --> 00:59:00,970
it's done so far What's so amazing That keeps us stargazing
think we might see someday we'll find it the rainbow

571
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:06,990
connection the lovers the dreamers and me

572
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:25,820
i don't know this part wait oh my god have you been half
asleep or have you heard voices.

573
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,720
I've heard them calling my name.

574
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:38,540
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?

575
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,460
The voice might be one and the same.

576
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:51,100
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.

577
00:59:51,700 --> 01:00:08,120
It's something that I'm supposed to someday we'll find it
the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and me

578
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:36,460

She never fails to impress.

583
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,320
Really?

584
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,740
Were you impressed?

585
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,640
Hold on, wait.

01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,460
Wait, maybe I should sing Bruno Mars' part then.

627
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,460
Maybe I should sing Bruno Mars' part then.

628
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,080
Whatever.

629
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,860

01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,040
Oh, let's see what else.

A little break with Levera.

635
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:38,680
Crying, I'm not sure if it's from laughter or how pretty you

Yay, yay, yay Stroller Don't say it!

654
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,940
I wonder what else...

655
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,820
What other...

656
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:30,940
Levi...

657
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,600
I haven't done this one.

658
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,140
Actually, I haven't done a lot of these.

659
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:37,840
Oh!

660
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:45,980
Mintney Spears, maybe.

661
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,860
Odoriko, I thought about that song earlier.

662
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,120
Snow White?

663
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,480
That's literally the song.

664
01:10:55,780 --> 01:11:05,440
hovering over oh my gosh i'll try it i'll try it i'm never
sung about this one i'm gonna do with reverb though this is

665
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:12,560
a sad song can't help but notice

666
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:25,960
in which i failed myself i failed the world all the same

667
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:35,400
It's not up for debate.

668
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:44,580
A woman's best currency is her body, not her brain.

669
01:11:46,700 --> 01:12:06,900
They try to tell me, tell me I'm wrong, but mirrors tell
lies to me my mind just plays along the world is a sick

670
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:32,870
place at least for a girl the people want beauty skinny
always wins and i don't have enough of it i'll never of it

671
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:56,490
Sometimes I see her She looks like snow white She's
everything I am But my wrongs are turned to rights Her body

672
01:12:56,490 --> 01:13:03,950
is smaller skin is so fair.

673
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:14,170
She's achieved everything I've dreamed of and it's all that
I can think of.

674
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:30,290
They try to tell me, tell me I'm wrong, but mirrors tell
lies to me, my mind just plays along.

675
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:51,250
The world is a sick place At least for a girl The people
want beauty, skinny always wins And I don't have enough of

676
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:58,480
it I'll never have of it

677
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,960
This song is so sad

678
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,840
Lavey, are you okay?

679
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,900
Let's do a happy song next.

680
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:25,820
What's a happy song?

681
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,520
What's a happy song?

682
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,740
TK rep.

683
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:37,860
So true.

684
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,010
Oh yeah, you didn't say Twilight, right?

685
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:48,510
earlier.

686
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:55,010
Wait, I think I have to like adjust that song to...

687
01:14:55,010 --> 01:15:01,280
Was it electric light?

688
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,900
Was it taken down?

689
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,920
Oh my gosh, I don't say it anymore.

690
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,320
Oh no, there it is.

691
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:11,700
Just kidding.

692
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:12,540
Ha ha ha.

693
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:42,970
of time, twilight crawling through my window pane.

694
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,830
Am I awake or do I dream?

695
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:56,930
The strangest pictures I have seen, night is day and
twilight's gone away.

696
01:15:58,370 --> 01:16:05,250
With your head held high and your scarlet lies, you came
down to me from the open skies.

697
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:18,870
It's either real or it's a dream There's nothing that is in
between Twilight I only meant to stay a while Twilight I

698
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:25,270
gave you time To steal my mind Away from me

699
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:40,360
Across the night I saw your face Face, you disappeared
without a trace Trace, you brought me here But can you take

700
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,460
me back?

701
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:54,220
Inside the image of your light Now that, now that it's the
hey, you have my dyslexia You let me hear and then you go

702
01:16:54,220 --> 01:17:08,520
away It's either real or it's a dream There's nothing that
is in between Twilight

703
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,120
I always, this song is such an otaku song, right?

704
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,880
I'm not the only one that thinks that, right?

705
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:38,420
You brought me here, but can you take me back again?

706
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:47,460
With your head held high and your scarlet flies, you came
down to me from the open skies.

707
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:50,680
It's either real or it's a dream, there's nothing that is
here.

708
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,460
in between.

709
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:57,240
Twilight, I only meant to stay a while.

710
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:04,660
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind.

711
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,420
Bye-bye.

712
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:14,300
Twilight, I only meant to stay a while.

713
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:24,770
I only meant to stay a while Yeah!

714
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,330
You guys know!

715
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:48,880
I can't tell you how many times I watched that Daikon video
Like an insane amount of time

716
01:18:52,890 --> 01:19:07,350
It's so good Reminds me of simpler times Reminds me of all
the good things times man oh my gosh watching the den setu

717
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:16,030
video makes me want to sing something like kind of nico nico
and that song also makes me want to sing kind of nico nico

718
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:27,070
opportunity nicholas lures happy birthday happy happy
birthday happy birthday and encapsulation of pop culture

719
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,270
from that time right

720
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:34,190
I think you'd love her music.

721
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:34,970
Oh, write it down.

722
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,210
Same vibes as Levera?

723
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,590
Okay.

724
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,230
I don't know it.

725
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:39,030
I'll look it up.

726
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:40,010
Thank you.

727
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,610
Now all my neighbors know about Otaku Music!

728
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:46,270
What's a...

729
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:48,210
Do you know, Linger by the Cranberries?

730
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:50,850
Oh my gosh.

731
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,110
Wait, Killy Killy Joker!

732
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:56,630
I almost sang that song for my 3D.

733
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:58,570
That's crazy.

734
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,450
I almost...

735
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:02,430
Why did I switch?

736
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:17,130
I don't remember I almost sang that one though Linger Linger
I think I I know that one I'm pretty sure I think so I might

737
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:18,790
get some of it wrong I'm sorry

738
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:31,450
I'm writing some more songs down Bye.

739
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:10,010
If you...

740
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:22,890
If you could return Don't let it burn Don't let it fade I'm
sure I'm not being rude But it's just your attitude It's

741
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:37,950
tearing me apart It's ruining everything And I swore I swear
I would be true Now honey, so did you So why were you

742
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:42,510
holding her hand Is that the way we stand?

743
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,030
Were you lying all the time?

744
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,970
Was it just a game to you?

745
01:21:47,910 --> 01:22:05,250
But I'm in so deep You know I'm such a fool for you You got
me wrapped around your feet Do you have to let it linger?

746
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:06,650
Do you have to?

747
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:07,790
Do you have to?

748
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:10,870
Do you have to let it linger?

749
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:17,790
Oh, I thought the world of you.

750
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:22,890
I thought nothing could, wait, go wrong.

751
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,290
But I was wrong.

752
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,550
Wait, I didn't remember this part.

753
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:26,910
I'm sorry.

754
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:44,410
you if you could get by trying not to lie things wouldn't be
so confused and i wouldn't feel so used but you always

755
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:55,410
really knew i just want to be with you and i'm in so deep
you know i'm such a fool

756
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:06,070
around your finger Do you have to let it linger?

757
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:07,390
Do you have to?

758
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:08,570
Do you have to?

759
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:11,410
Do you have to let it linger?

760
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:46,480
But I'm in so deep You know I'm such a fool for you You got
me wrapped around your finger Do you have to let it linger?

761
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:47,960
Do you have to?

762
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,100
Do you have to?

763
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,720
Do you have to let it linger?

764
01:23:53,480 --> 01:24:06,680
You know I'm such a fool for you You got me wrapped around
your finger Do you have to let it linger?

765
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:08,240
Do you have to?

766
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,340
Do you have to?

767
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,700
Do you have to let it linger?

768
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:50,870
I know what I'm going to sing next.

769
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,850
Oh, wait, which one was it?

770
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:54,910
Was it this one?

771
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:56,490
Wait, which one was it?

772
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,470
Wait, which one was it?

773
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:00,390
Is it this one?

774
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,110
Don't remember.

775
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,460
I think so.

776
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:14,920
I'll

777
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:30,720
be closer.

778
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,680
Hear what I have to say

779
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:53,790
Just like children we sleep in We could dream this night
away

780
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:11,880
But there's a full moon rising Let's go dancing in the night
Where

781
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:28,000
the music's playing Let's go out and feel that night

782
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:52,360
Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance
again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest

783
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,660
moon And

784
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:19,410
we were strangers I watched you from afar

785
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,820
Now it's getting late

786
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:12,970
I want to celebrate See it shining in your life Because

787
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:38,250
I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon So

788
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:49,130
much for the best he gets in the dark

789
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:43,680
Because I'm still in love with you I wanna see you dance
again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest

790
01:29:43,680 --> 01:30:13,240
moon We'll get all these similar ones out of the way Similar
vibes.

791
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,520
Oh

792
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,930
my gosh, groove and magic!

793
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:26,290
I heard this song recently.

794
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,340
Over the county.

795
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:43,880
And I drive the main road, searching in the sun for another
overlord.

796
01:30:46,560 --> 01:31:01,120
I hear you singing in the wire I can hear you through the
wire And the witch's alignment

797
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,460
Is still on the line

798
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:31,660
I know I need a small vacation But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the

799
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:56,660
strain And I need you more than want you And I want you for
all time And the wretched alignment It's still on the line.

800
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:43,060
And I need you more than want you And I want you for all
time And the witch in alignment Is still on the line

801
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:20,790
Hey, thank you guys.

802
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,190
Thank you.

803
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:22,050
Thank you.

804
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,090
That was a Wichita Lineman.

805
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,030
Wait, that was like a back-to-back.

806
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:25,990
Wait, what was I?

807
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:26,710
What did I do?

808
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:27,470
Back-to-back.

809
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:31,010
Linger, Harvest Moon, Wichita Lineman.

810
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:38,210
I realized, I think tomorrow I'm going to save the Nico Nico
songs.

811
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:43,790
I want to sing a couple songs tomorrow, so I think I'll save
it for then.

812
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,370
I already picked out what songs I want to sing, so.

813
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:57,930
songs that I have that I want to sing so I'll save it for
tomorrow Killy Killy Joker though so I remember that well

814
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:07,370
enough I didn't like learn it learn it because I you know I
know the chorus for sure

815
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:30,750
soft heart song wait Killy Killy Joker It's stinking Kanon
Wakashima, so it's like, well, she doesn't wait, what's the

816
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,230

She doesn't, uh, let's...

818
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:44,790

820
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:47,010
Is there an instrumental, let's say?

821
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,630
There is.

822
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:52,430
I don't think I can sing it, though.

823
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:53,070
Not today.

824
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:54,510
Tomorrow's my birthday!

825
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:58,970
I should have Happy early birthday Happy early birthday

826
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:12,610
I think I could do still doll though I think I remember it
Cause I I did that song like crazy I wasn't even a vampire

827
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:28,050
night Girlie even But I'll try it Let's see Oh my gosh, it's
so...

828
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:30,410
I haven't heard this song in like a decade.

829
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:32,940
Let's see how well I can do it.

830
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:56,450
I miss Alice.

831
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:19,770
I'm so happy to be here.

832
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:39,100
I'm still a heartless, My heart's heart is s-
S-ke-ske-ske-ske- It's a-nagare-tere-tere It's a great space

833
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:44,100
It's a great space.

834
01:36:52,060 --> 01:37:04,500
I think I didn't choose Killy Killy Joker was because one of
Wakeshima Kanon's She is a beautiful cello player So it was

Oh, sorry, I forgot to change the song.

842
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:40,970
That was still dull.

843
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:42,450
Dull.

844
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:43,750
Still dull.

845
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,310
Oh, my gosh.

846
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:51,490
I seriously haven't heard that song in like a decade for
real.

847
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:55,290
I can't believe I remember so much of it.

848
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:56,970
Wait, that kind of makes me want to sing something else.

849
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:57,990
Hold on.

850
01:38:58,030 --> 01:38:58,570
Oh, gosh.

I just finished binging Matt Cross and apparently being
cousins never stopped some people.

887
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,320
Wait, should we sing a Macross song?

888
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:28,260
The composer for our song, Anita-san, is one of the
composers for Macross Delta.

889
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:30,680
Let's see.

I'm sorry, I don't know it!

906
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,810
I could do Lion since there's like a...

907
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:28,350
There's already a karaoke for it.

908
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:31,170
Wait, what's... How's Lion go again?

909
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:38,690

910
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:39,310
Oh,

911
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,220
now you're spamming.

912
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,080
The timeout you go.

913
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:50,700
Christmas songs.

914
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,700
We'll save that for Christmas.

915
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,300
I feel like I've sang that one quite a bit recently too.

916
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,200
Okay, I'm going to sing Lion.

917
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:08,220
I'm going to try and remember.

918
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

919
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,860
Oh, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

920
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,220
Wait, did I sing this one recently then?

921
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,960
Why is it showing that I've sung it?

922
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,420
I want to sing one that I don't sing often.

923
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:32,100
Oh wait, oh my gosh This is one like that You don't hear
very often

924
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,780
Hopefully this is an actual instrumental It says it is

925
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,200
I'm more, I'm more

926
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:10,540
Is my key off?

927
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:33,020
Oh my god, the lyrics they give you were bad.

928
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:52,540
They're slow!

929
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:59,480
They're slow!

930
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,220
Why the hell did I choose a song?

931
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,720
It's been so long, I can't even remember it.

932
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:34,280
Ah!

933
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:35,920
Sorry.

934
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:39,380
I used to listen to this one a lot, so I thought that I
would remember it, but I don't know.

935
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:41,320

It is, but they're the only ones uploading these
instrumentals!

942
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,900
Okay, hopefully this one's better.

943

971
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:52,080
Yawamushi, naki, mushi-tolerate I'm still going to think I'm
more than I think I'm more than I'm more than I'm more I'm

972
01:50:52,080 --> 01:51:06,240
more than I'm always, Tayasui, I'm just a bit too much It's
a bit of a bad thing, but I'm not going to be able to get

973
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:11,020
out of it, but I'm not going to be able to get to get me.

974
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:19,050
I'm just going to get you.

975
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:23,110
If it's not my fault, then it's not my fault.

976
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:29,210
My feelings are the ones who kiss me.

977
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:34,630
I'm not the one who's the one.

978
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:50,210
The heart of the world is more than The responsibility is at
the end of the day Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Hi, baby In the

979
01:51:50,210 --> 01:52:06,490

out-dash-dash-koying Yoroke-tah with the breath.

980
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:09,630
With the breath, it's all full.

981
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:13,310
Come here and come here and get it.

982
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:16,910
It's so hard to see.

983
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:17,550
It's so hard to look forward.

984
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:24,470
The way you're looking for with a smiling voice.

985
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:27,330
I can't remember the future.

986
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:30,410
It's my mother right now.

987
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:38,130
I'm just gonna hold me And I'll be the same thing

988
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:51,090
You're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one
who's the one, that's the one, that's all the other.

989
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:56,410
The tears are like a yakuza, the other.

990
01:52:56,410 --> 01:52:58,910
The stars are the same.

991
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,660
Uh-oh, is there a bridge?

992
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,480

993
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:11,220

02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:24,840
And it was just like, hello.

1069
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:27,220

1070
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:34,900
Would you like to be a guest speaker for my e-sports, for
our e-sports class?

1071
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:44,720
Of course I'm going to do it, but they were like, it's kind
of an urgent matter.

1072
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:49,960
But they didn't tell me when.

1073
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:54,620
Of course I'm going to accept.

1074
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:57,720
And then they were like, here's the address to the school.

1075
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:03,880
If you cannot show up, you can Zoom call.

1076
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:11,260

I've never done esports, that's a lie.

1082
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:53,430

1084

I'm not, I don't know why I'm being invited to the esports
class.

1085
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:06,650
I didn't even know, high schools had an esports class.

1086
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:09,870
I'm excited to hear what you have to say about esports.

1087
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:19,090

streamer and I'm going to be like luck baby it's all about

Let's see, uh...

1146
02:08:24,190 --> 02:08:25,490
Did I spell it wrong?

1147
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:30,950
What do you mean there's no results for my chemical romance?

1148
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:34,290

02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:36,730
Huh?

1151
02:08:37,530 --> 02:08:37,650
What?

1152
02:08:38,090 --> 02:08:38,930
What do you mean?

1153
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:49,300
That's like not possible.

1154
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:53,620
That's like not possible.

1155
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:56,620
Really?

1156
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:03,640
Try MCR.

1157
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,480
Did they rebrand?

1158
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:10,800
No, I get Tate McRae.

1159
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:13,680
I don't know who that is.

1160
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:16,900
No way.

1161
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:18,360
That's craziness.

1162
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:19,820
But that's okay.

1163
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:21,120
I want to do some...

1164
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:23,620
You know what?

1165
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:26,580
I say I don't want to sing all the same songs all the time.

1166
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:28,380
But there are some songs that I do want to sing.

1167
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:31,720
That are some of the ones that I like.

1168
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:38,380
We'll do this one I know you guys will like.

1169
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:45,530
Emo isn't real mint.

1170
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:46,230
No!

1171
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:47,750
It wasn't a face!

1172
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:48,570
It wasn't a face!

1173
02:09:55,280 --> 02:10:04,520
If there's a prize for rotten judgment, I guess I've already
won that.

1174
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:07,640
No man is worth the aggravation.

1175
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:10,460
That's ancient history.

1176
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:12,740
Been there, done that.

1177
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:14,280
Who'd you think you're kidding?

1178
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:18,300
He's the earth and heaven till you try to keep it hidden.

1179
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,180
Honey, we can see right now.

1180
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:22,360
Oh no!

1181
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:27,500
We know how you feel and who you think you know.

1182
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:33,060
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no.

1183
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:36,640
You swoon, you saw why deny it, oh.

1184
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:42,100
It's too cliche, I won't say I'm in love.

1185
02:10:44,860 --> 02:10:47,560
I thought my heart had learned its lesson.

1186
02:10:48,240 --> 02:11:00,300
It feels so good when you start out My head is screaming,
get a grip, girl Unless you're dying to cry your heart out

1187
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:10,580
You keep on denying Who you are and how you're feeling When
we saw your head was clear I said, I could grow up Wherever

1188
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:24,660
you go, I'll do what you got by me Oh, no chance, no way I
won't say it, no, no Give it Check the grin, you're in love

1189
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:28,620
This scene won't play I won't say I'm in love

1190
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:42,960
Your way, your face, I won't say it Get off my case, I won't
say it Girl, don't be proud, it's okay

1191
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:55,750
At least out loud I won't say I'm in love

1192
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:10,910
Do you like my acting?

1193
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:15,270
Zero the hero?

1194
02:12:16,050 --> 02:12:17,690
I don't know if I've ever done that one before.

1195
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:20,230
Zero the hero.

1196
02:12:20,670 --> 02:12:21,630
He was a zero.

1197
02:12:22,010 --> 02:12:22,970
Zero, zero.

1198
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:24,250
No, he's a hero.

1199
02:12:24,850 --> 02:12:26,470
Okay, I might mess this up.

1200
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:27,530
Let's try it.

1201
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:35,460
Bless my soul.

1202
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:36,840
Herc was on a roll.

1203
02:12:37,180 --> 02:12:38,880
Person of the week and every green.

1204
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:39,960
opinion poll.

1205
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:41,220
What a pro.

1206
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,760
Hurt could stop a show.

1207
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,400
Point him at a monster and you're talking SRO.

1208
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:48,620
Here was a no one, a zero, zero.

1209
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:51,420
Now he's a honcho, he's a hero.

1210
02:12:51,860 --> 02:12:57,380
Here was a kid with his act down pat from zero to hero in no
time flat.

1211
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:00,320
Zero to hero, just like that.

1212
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:05,900
When you smile, the girls went wild with ooze and eyes.

1213
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:11,740
And they slapped his face on every on every of us.

1214
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:17,260
Repairance fees and royalties, our herk had cash to burn.

1215
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:23,520
From Noburu, rich or famous, he could tell you what the
Grecians are.

1216
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:26,480
Say amen, there he goes again.

1217
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:29,420
So you don't defeat it at an awesome 10 for 10.

1218
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,440
Folks lined up, just a one with chip flecks.

1219
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:35,540
This perfect package with a pair of pretty pegs.

1220
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:38,300
Herky he comes, he sees he conquers.

1221
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:41,440
The crafts were go-wake balkers.

1222
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:43,020
I don't know this part at all.

1223
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:46,940
Zero to hero, a major hunt.

1224
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,940
Zero to hero, and who to thug?

1225
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:55,420
Who want the gladding gladiator?

1226
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:56,560
Hercules.

1227
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:59,340
Who daring deeds are great theater?

1228
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:00,860
Hercules.

1229
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:02,300
Is he bold?

1230
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:04,280
Is he sweet?

1231
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:06,420
Hercules.

1232
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:08,420
Hercules.

1233
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:10,320
Hercules!

1234
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:11,600
Ow!

1235
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:13,200
I don't know.

1236
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:14,700
Hercules!

1237
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:16,840
Hercules!

1238
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:27,820
Bless my soul, Herk was on a row, undefeated, riding high
and the nicest guy, not conceited, he was a nothing, now

1239
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:37,600
he's a honcho, he's a hero, he's a hero, he's a breakneck,
speed, from, oh, from zero to hero, Herk is a hero, now he's

1240
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:38,020
a hero,

1241
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:43,640
Yes, indeed.

1242
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:45,020
Oh, my God.

1243
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:48,480
Oh, geez.

1244
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:55,060
I'm out of water.

1245
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,540
Are we just going to sing all Hercules songs?

1246
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:02,340
Oops, all Hercules.

1247
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:03,560

1251
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:10,560

still down to the wire finishing up, but it's just been

1275
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:28,360
like, mad.

1276

so much recording, so much.

1278
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:59,460
uh hopefully hopefully it's all worth it hopefully you guys
like everything and yeah yeah you're at a wedding this this

1279
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:10,390
weekend you should tell the dj to play densetsu mvps be like
dj put this on it's the hottest song right now

1280
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:20,960
so yeah i I'm very excited, obviously, about everything.

1281
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:30,660
I, you know, I didn't expect some people's reactions to it.

1282
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:37,080
I was really happy, you know, that so many people were, um,
were really excited for us.

1283
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:48,520
But I think, you know, there are some people that are kind
of nervous because of, um, Because of, you know, we've had a

1284
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:49,400
couple setbacks.

1285
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:53,420
I've had a couple setbacks in the past.

1286
02:18:55,340 --> 02:19:03,320
But I want to kind of reassure you guys that, you know, a
lot of planning went into this.

1287
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:12,100
And if we weren't so sure about it, like, we wouldn't have
gone through with it.

1288
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:26,160
and um you know i i had i i was on i remember being in my
hotel room and i i was like seeing people's responses i was

1289
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:32,460
like whoa and it makes sense because to us we understand
what's going on and to you guys you're probably just like

1290
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:42,720
what is this what is happening what is going on um so uh it
probably seems like a little more obviously it's official

1291
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:55,820
but like a little more how to say like because we're not
corporate so it probably it might seem that way but you know

1292
02:19:55,820 --> 02:20:07,380
we still all own our IPs and everything we we're very much
still you know even I think you know like even if Setsuna

1293
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:15,020
were to pull out we would still be Den Setsu if we wanted to
be so yeah i know that some people are quite weary about

1294
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:27,180
corpo corporations and everything right now um but but well
like i said we were we um satsuna has been really great with

1295
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:38,880
us and uh so far and um things won't change for my content
at all um except just adding more stuff for you guys so uh

1296
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:47,940
so yeah i just wanted to like i was like having an anxiety
attack at the hotel room i was like because i don't know i

1297
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:54,320
just didn't expect to us you know obviously we know what's
going on behind the scenes so we know what's happening and

1298
02:20:54,320 --> 02:21:01,060
then so i was like oh my gosh i didn't expect people's
reactions and i was like wow wow it just it threw me through

1299
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:13,380
a loop but um yeah so uh we're we're very confident that you
know that things will be awesome and we're excited for

1300
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:27,680
everything so we just want to take you guys along on the
journey so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah not and you know well

1301
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:34,020
yeah yeah i was gonna say something and then i lost the i
had the the second part of the thought and i did not have

1302
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:41,680
the first part of the thought and thank you guys so much for
the donos i do see them thank you thank you thank you

1303
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:55,900
magical circle guru guru i'm sorry i don't know thought of
train yeah but yeah i guess uh you know it kind of came out

1304
02:21:55,900 --> 02:22:06,340
of nowhere and i guess it's appeared different than how it
actually is so um you know uh maybe maybe if we look like

1305
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:13,760
we're corporate that means we have our stuff together
because behind the scenes we're kind and believe it looks

1306
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:22,460
like we we look so official that we look like we could be
corporate but but behind the scenes we're like we're like

1307
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:30,880
scrambling little ants we're all over the place can't
control thank you so much for that guys so much happy to see

1308
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:36,400
you three get the debut as idols can't wait to support you

1309
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:50,960

so it still feels bizarre to me even still feels very

1310
02:22:50,960 --> 02:23:02,860
strange a lot of this stuff a lot of this stuff was well not
a lot there was a handful of things that were being prepared

1311
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:15,260
a long long time ago and then kind of everything got thrown
into a blender and so kind of to kind of throw pick up the

1312
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:22,820
pieces and try to puzzle them back together and see what we
can salvage and what we could still use and we oh man you

1313
02:23:22,820 --> 02:23:30,800
know i love i'm really happy with our song so much i love um
the work that anita san has done we did have another artist

1314
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:40,100
that i was so excited to work with um maybe hopefully we can
still work with them one day it was like a dream artist of

1315
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:48,620
mine so i was like i was like unfortunately it didn't work
out but i honestly i don't even mind because the song is

1316
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:56,220
just that it's just that so it's just that good i can't wait
for you guys to hear it oh i can't wait for you guys to hear

1317
02:23:56,220 --> 02:24:04,990

1318
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:05,770
And...

1319
02:24:08,010 --> 02:24:08,410
And...

1320
02:24:09,550 --> 02:24:09,950
So...

I wonder.

1328
02:24:23,690 --> 02:24:24,670
I'll do my best.

1329
02:24:26,750 --> 02:24:28,130
Let me do another throat spray.

1330
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:36,730
Cover with Nimi!

1331
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:37,490
Thank you!

1332
02:24:40,270 --> 02:24:44,250
Now whenever I hear on my own I'm going to think of Epinian
longing for soul to sing.

1333
02:24:44,430 --> 02:24:45,230
No, it's me!

1334
02:24:45,690 --> 02:24:46,330
It's me!

1335
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:51,050
Okay.

1336
02:24:52,430 --> 02:24:53,990
This will be probably my last song.

1337
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:55,890
I know I wanted to actually sing much longer.

1338
02:24:56,210 --> 02:24:57,750
I don't even know how many songs I've done.

1339
02:25:00,070 --> 02:25:00,910
Maybe a few.

1340
02:25:02,210 --> 02:25:02,490
Hmm.

1341
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:07,080
And I'll sing some more tomorrow.

1342
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:08,360
Just a couple songs, though.

1343
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:09,300
Just a couple.

1344
02:25:11,560 --> 02:25:21,760
It sounds exactly like something you'd produce just all
kinds of woosh and wah woosh and wah woosh and wah yeah

1345
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:35,980
so okay last song last song save your voice for tomorrow no
no no it's okay it's okay I just I am okay I just don't know

1346
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:44,460
if I'll hit the note because we'll see we'll see we'll see
Let's try.

1347
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:46,800
I'm stronger now.

1348
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:52,940
Connection lost.

1349
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:54,480
Wait, what?

1350
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:55,840
What do you mean by that?

1351
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:57,420
Am I still streaming?

1352
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:00,300
Am I still live?

1353
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:03,740
Wait, what do you mean, connection lost?

1354
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:05,920
I am?

1355
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:06,460
Oh.

1356
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:09,580
Maybe...

1357
02:26:09,580 --> 02:26:10,700
Hold on, let me see.

1358
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,640
Let me open Carol Fun Up again.

1359
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:15,240
Oh, here we go.

1360
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:16,380
Oh, it's just starting.

1361
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:17,360
Okay, let's go!

1362
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:37,240
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone Gazing
at the people down below me All my life I watch them as I

1363
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:48,820
hide up here alone Hungry for the histories they show me All
my life I memorize their faces Knowing them as they will

1364
02:26:48,820 --> 02:27:07,760
never know me All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a
day Not above them But part of them And out there Living in

1365
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:31,380
the sun Give me one day out there All I ask is one To hold
forever Where they all live are nowhere What I'd give What I

1366
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:40,680
dare Just to live one day out there

1367
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:53,770
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them Every day they

1368
02:27:53,770 --> 02:27:59,570
shout and scold and go about their lives, heedless of the
gift it is to be them.

1369
02:27:59,910 --> 02:28:14,690
If I was in their skin, I'd treasure every instant out
there, strolling by the sand.

1370
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:21,910
Taste a morning out there like ordinary men.

1371
02:28:22,170 --> 02:28:41,970
Who freely walk about there Just one day and then I swear
I'll be content With my share Won't present, won't despair

1372
02:28:41,970 --> 02:28:49,350
Hold and bent, I won't care All has meant for us

1373
02:28:57,910 --> 02:29:18,180
I can't hit that damn note I can't do it I can't hit that
sticker now it haunts me it haunts me that stupid ass note

1374
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:24,640
thank you guys almost there literally But that's not the
name of the song.

1375
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:25,920
The song is called Out There.

1376
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:35,230
Oh, the trauma of the song.

1377
02:29:35,410 --> 02:29:36,530
Ah, we'll do it.

1378
02:29:36,530 --> 02:29:36,890
We'll do it.

1379
02:29:36,890 --> 02:29:38,010
I'll do it better next time.

1380
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:43,200
It's such a high note.

1381
02:29:43,380 --> 02:29:43,840
It is.

1382
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:45,820
It's like a knot in my...

1383
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:50,060
I could hit it if I don't use my head voice.

1384
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:50,940
You know?

1385
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:51,800
Like I use...

1386
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:53,220
Like the way I sing the song.

1387
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:55,640
Like...

1388
02:29:57,480 --> 02:30:00,980
You know, it's very easy if I sing with my chest.

1389
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:14,060
chest voice but with my head voice it's like so high and
then I always forget to switch so oh well whatever I give up

1390
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:22,640
I give up it's not like I'm gonna be it's not like I'm gonna
be singing it's not like it's not like I have a group to

1391
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:33,540
depend on me or anything for my voice it's not like it's not
like I'm gonna be concerts or...

1392
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:36,190
Yes!

1393
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:38,930
Yeah, I'm not like, it's my job!

1394
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:44,050
Okay, wait.

1395
02:30:44,650 --> 02:30:45,650
I want to do one more.

1396
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:48,230
I want to do one that I can end on that sounds good.

1397
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:49,730
What's a what?

1398
02:30:50,270 --> 02:30:51,910
What's a song that I could sing.

1399
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:53,590
Oh,

1400
02:30:56,830 --> 02:30:57,470
What's a song?

1401
02:30:58,590 --> 02:30:58,970
Oh.

1402
02:31:00,270 --> 02:31:00,570
Oh.

1403
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:05,760
Oh.

1404
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:09,740
how the end of my brain is.

1405
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:12,000
My brain is braining?

1406
02:31:16,450 --> 02:31:17,750
Killy, Killy Joker.

1407
02:31:17,910 --> 02:31:20,030
I literally said I didn't learn it.

1408
02:31:20,270 --> 02:31:21,110
Shut up.

1409
02:31:21,550 --> 02:31:23,470
I'm going to put you in timeout.

1410
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:27,030
It's also mostly...

1411
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:29,550
It's mostly cello.

1412
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:35,710
A love live.

1413
02:31:36,730 --> 02:31:38,430
A love live song.

1414
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:46,590
Love live What's a love slap song?

1415
02:31:47,210 --> 02:31:50,930
I scream, scream, scream my show

1416
02:31:55,430 --> 02:31:56,170
Wait!

1417
02:31:57,430 --> 02:32:04,530
You guys, I think I have to sing this song Given the Given
our location

1418
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:22,160
It's like the right now.

1419
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:28,600
It's like the sky came from the sky.

1420
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:29,920
Woohoo!

1421
02:32:30,220 --> 02:32:30,540
Woohoo!

1422
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:47,920
A special season of color is the toky-meky, I'm gonna show
you the first time I've met you at the time from the feeling

1423
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:57,380
I can't even hear the sound of the melody I can't stop, I
can't stop, why?

1424
02:32:59,100 --> 02:33:01,080
Why don't you tell me how it's so sad?

1425
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:17,680
The name of the song, the song, the song When the feelings
are going to happen, I'm not waiting for you.

1426
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:28,540
I'm not sure, but I love the truth In the heat of the world
Can't be too bad, no doubt about it To be called, I'm ready

1427
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:34,580
to sing I'm almost at the start

1428
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:50,570
With no sound, no, no No, no, no No, no, no, no, no No, no,
no,

1429
02:34:13,030 --> 02:34:19,690
no I'd like to be there, wherever, wherever.

1430
02:34:20,910 --> 02:34:25,030
Fly high, I'd say that it's no matter.

1431
02:34:27,210 --> 02:34:29,590
I'm a big one.

1432
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:30,770
I'm too big.

1433
02:34:31,230 --> 02:34:32,450
I'm a true emotion.

1434
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:35,610
I'm a dreamer, I'm a dreamer.

1435
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:37,950
It's very hard.

1436
02:34:37,950 --> 02:34:54,790
I just

1437
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,300
remember something.

1438
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:13,900
Oh, shoot.

1439
02:35:16,620 --> 02:35:20,540
I'll just remember something.

1440
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:24,160
Oh, shoot.

1441
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:52,020
I wish I was ancient history I'll have a greater time

1442
02:36:19,150 --> 02:36:19,710
Yay!

1443
02:36:20,970 --> 02:36:22,590
That reminds me that...

1444
02:36:23,390 --> 02:36:26,950
I'm glad I have a manager now because I don't respond to
emails sometimes.

1445
02:36:27,110 --> 02:36:28,290
I get busy.

1446
02:36:30,170 --> 02:36:30,730
Yeah.

1447
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:33,410
Otomito everybody!

1448
02:36:33,690 --> 02:36:35,190
Thank you so much!

1449
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:36,210
Thank you, thank you!

1450
02:36:36,670 --> 02:36:37,490
Thank you, thank you!

1451
02:36:38,730 --> 02:36:38,790
Thank you!

1452
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:39,370
Thank you!

1453
02:36:39,370 --> 02:36:39,890
Thank you!

1454
02:36:39,890 --> 02:36:40,030
Thank you!

1455
02:36:40,030 --> 02:36:45,350
I might have gotten an email from a certain someone who
likes a girl and done.

1456
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:47,410
I don't know!

1457
02:36:48,110 --> 02:36:48,590
Cypher!

1458
02:36:50,290 --> 02:36:51,250
Happy birthday.

1459
02:36:56,450 --> 02:36:57,610
Happy belated birthday.

1460
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:02,330
Densutsu.exe, I'll see you there!

1461
02:37:03,250 --> 02:37:04,370
See you there, see you there, see you there.

1462
02:37:04,970 --> 02:37:05,750
Bye-bye.

1463
02:37:06,050 --> 02:37:06,470
Bye-bye.

1464
02:37:06,590 --> 02:37:09,510
Bye-bye.

1465
02:37:09,630 --> 02:37:11,750
Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye.

1466
02:37:13,170 --> 02:37:13,910
Bye-bye-bye.

1467
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:16,070
Bye-bye.

1468
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:16,830
You better be there.

1469
02:37:18,310 --> 02:37:20,590
You better be there, all of you, every single one of you.

1470
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:21,710
Bye-bye.
