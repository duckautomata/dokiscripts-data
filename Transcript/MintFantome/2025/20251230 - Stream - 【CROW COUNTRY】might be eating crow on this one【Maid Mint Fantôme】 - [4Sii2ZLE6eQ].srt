1
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,080
Bye-bye, boo!

2
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Bye-bye, boo!

3
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,240
Everybody.

4
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,520
Hello.

5
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,340
Hello.

6
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,400
Fancy seeing you here today.

7
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,120
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

8
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,080
Welcome, welcome.

9
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,640
Hello.

10
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,920
Artist known as Minto.

11
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,080
Scary!

12
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,260
Scary!

13
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,380
Time for some wintertime horror.

14
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,500
How long has it been since I've played a horror game?

15
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,600
I think I played so many in October that I was like, I
shouldn't touch anymore for a bit.

16
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,860
But this game has been recommended to me so many times that
I was like, okay, I have to try it, I suppose.

17
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,040
I suppose, I suppose.

18
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
But I'm going to be honest, you guys.

19
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,020
I think I've said this before, but for anybody who missed
it, I'm not really good with it.

20
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,020
These kinds of survival horror, they're like just not my
type.

21
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,160
They're like not my type of horror that I like.

22
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
So I'm kind of like...

23
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,040
That's why I haven't played it.

24
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,500
Until now.

25
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,820
Joy, welcome to Vumbushim.

26
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,460
Purple Vax, welcome to Vumbushim.

27
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,140
Thank you, bro.

28
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,060
Thank you.

29
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,940
Time to beat another game today.

30
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah!

31
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,940
Today is another longer stream, I think.

33
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,140
So, buckle in.

34
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,720
Or, you know, not buckle in.

35
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,840
We're just here to chill.

36
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,160
We're chilling, we're relaxing, you know.

37
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,810
Kodanoa!

38
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,530
Happy birthday!

39
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,450
Thank you so much!

40
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,150
We're 20 months!

41
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,850
Thank you!

42
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,450
Happy, happy birthday!

43
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,490
Whoa, Vera, thank you so much.

44
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,590
I've been able to watch streams lately due to being really
busy.

45
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,370
Congrats on becoming an idol in your upcoming jazz concert!

46
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,310
Thank you!

47
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,830
Vera Land, thank you so much for those!

48
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,570
Thank you!

49
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,070
Yeah, I have my jazz concert.

50
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,010
Tickets should be up.

51
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:41,990
There will be announcement, I believe, today of when tickets
will be up for the jazz concert on Oshi Spark.

52
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,650
Twitter.

53
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,590
So, read the whole thing.

54
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,030
What do you mean read the whole thing?

55
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,150
What else are...

56
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,110
Oh, really proud of you.

57
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,870
Thank you.

58
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,510
we're here for moral support so i'll be good yeah i don't
know i guess like i always find these games more tedious

59
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:12,170
than spooky but this seems kind of spooky like the
atmosphere right now i don't know it's or rather it's spooky

60
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:18,810
at first and then it kind of loses the feeling but this game
is It's not so long, so maybe it'll be pretty good to hold a

61
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:18,950
knife.

62
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,970
I hope so.

63
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,050
Crokey, my below.

64
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,370
You're not crokey.

65
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,370
Wrong!

66
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,670
Wrong.

67
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:28,830
Wrong.

68
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,630
Wrong stream.

69
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,510
I'll dreamer.

70
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,890
Thank you so much for it, though.

71
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,770
We're so far.

72
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,150
Gifted.

73
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,770
Thank you.

74
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,710
Thank you.

75
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,810
Love the thumbnail art.

76
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,850
Yeah, we're kind of goffy today.

77
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,570
We're goffy today.

78
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,070
It's an unnerving game, that's for certain.

79
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,610
I see.

80
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,130
I'm excited to try it.

81
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,290
I mean, I can't say if I like it or dislike it unless I play
it, right?

82
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,070
So, congrats on upstarting art career.

83
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,810
Oh, thank you.

84
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,070
Exhibition on the Louvre.

85
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,070
Louvre me.

86
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,030
Steal me.

87
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,710
There's this guy that would, like, make songs about the
heist at the Louvre.

88
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,610
I'd be like the...

89
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:24,650
Two dudes who stole the painting at the Louvre were so
handsome or something like that.

90
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,390
Oh, also, Ducky, thank you for the offline don't know.

91
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,150
I saw it.

92
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:38,730
And yes, I don't know why you guys would make art based on
my drawings, but feel free.

93
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,510
For those that don't know, I made a sub account, like a sub

normal and then here comes Walter White and Jesse Pinkman

118

and they like Are screwing everything up These guys just
These guys are like so...

119
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,720
They're disaster children.

120
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,560
Played this through earlier in the year and had a blast with
it.

121
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,060
Good luck, Minto.

122
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you!

123
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,580
I guess we should get into it then, because it's gonna be a
bit of a longer stream, so...

124
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,020
New get- hold on.

125
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,860
I gotta turn on my controller again.

126
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,140
Welta.

127
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,660
Welta why?

128
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,440
What?

129
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,400
You will not be attacked?

130
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,920
Murder of crows.

131
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:56,980
Hard mode.

132
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,280
Resources are more limited.

133
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,380
Enemies are more aggressive.

134
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,740
Danger may be lurking around every corner in survival
horror.

135
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,840
Exploration mode.

136
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,340
Wait, this is for me!

137
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,500
Maybe somewhere can I find your art?

138
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,380
I would love to check it out.

139
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,080

140
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,560

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,320
A few months ago, you recommended Q-Pot stuff as a gift.

145
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,900
Wife loved her Christmas present.

146
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,500
Thanks for the gift.

147
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,380
I'm telling you, I'm telling...

148
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,260
Wait, what did you get?

149
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,040
More $200.

150
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,820
Also, thank you so much.

151
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,520
Wait, thank you for the donut.

152
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,940
Thank you for taking my advice.

153
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,960
Wait, what did you get?

154
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,860
What did you get her?

155
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,400
Nice thumbnail.

156
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,440
Thank you.

157
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
Thank you, of course.

158
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,640
Happy birthday.

159
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,820
I recommend exploration mode if you struggle with survival
horror games.

160
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,380
It's not that I I got her one of the chocolate wallets Let's
go

161
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:38,790
That's not that I'm bad with survival horror It's that I I
don't want to be a baby about it You know I'm just like I

162
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:47,710
just Don't enjoy the genre Superton Oh Barry Let's go

163
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,650
Oh wasn't very long, so all right.

164
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,290
Yesterday you said that bald is beautiful and said that if
we were balding, you'd just shave it off, so today I went

165
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:05,810
bald.

166
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,150
My head is now very cold.

167
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,870
Should have waited for some...

168
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,650
You went bald!

169
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,970
Oh my god!

170
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,370
You went bald!

171
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,170
That's so awesome!

172
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,090
You went bald!

173
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,870
The survival horror aspect of this game is pretty lax.

174
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,950
Okay, we'll do it then.

175
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,310
I don't want to be a baby about it.

176
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,150
That's no fun.

177
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,150
Not getting attacked at all.

178
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,110
Only horror, no survival.

179
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,830
That's pretty much how I feel.

180
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:36,710
2025!

181
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,030
Oh my gosh, we only have like two...

182
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,150
Oh.

183
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,430
1990!

184
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,010
Grandpa!

185
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:47,650
Hello, Mito.

186
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,890
I was like you!

187
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,570
Must confess, I...

188
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,870
I...

189
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,190
Also went bald.

190
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,750
My name is Mara.

191
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,350
Okay, sorry, I have to read these now.

192
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,750
Mara Forrest.

193
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,110
Special Agent Forrest.

194
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,070
That's me.

195
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,330
Don't forget.

196
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,930
Okay, Mara Forrest.

197
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,950
Special Agent Forrest.

198
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,650
Don't mess it up.

199
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,040
Okay.

200
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,900
Everybody's going bald.

201
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,120
This is so awesome.

202
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,800
Sarah Forrest.

203
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,220
Hey, hey.

204
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,360
mess it up.

205
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,840
That's me.

206
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,120
Mara Forest.

207
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,800
What a the schnaz on her.

208
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,450
Oh my gosh.

209
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,630
I can't walk and shoot at the same time.

210
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,330
I just...

211
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,550
Okay.

212
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,790
I have no... Why did I bring this gun?

213
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,770
Why am I holding it if I have no bullets?

214
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,170
Mara Forest, I thought... Oh, it's a car.

215
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,210
It's a really nice car, but it's covered in trash.

216
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,490
I guess the owner doesn't care for it anymore.

217
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,250
Why would she do that?

218
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,890
Why would she bring a gun and no bullets?

219
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,690
Oh, bugs are trash.

220
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:07,910
They're old.

221
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,530
They smell terrible.

222
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,130
How to be Vodkaing today.

223
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,290
We're looking forward to watching later.

224
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,790
The trailers for this look so cool.

225
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,550
Also very cute art.

226
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,230
I will enjoy from a respectful distance.

227
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,430
It's considered me so cute.

228
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,270
Thank you for the super chat.

229
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,810
You're MGS Pro.

230
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,850
You got this boss?

231
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,770
Is this a sneaking mission?

232
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,390
Ooh.

233
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,890
We've got one bird left.

234
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,310
Can I knock it?

235
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,770
Can I knock this over?

236
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,430
No, I can only dance around it.

237
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,990
Mara Forest, afraid of cones.

238
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,230
Anything else?

239
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,790
Oh, wait, there's a what?

240
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,110
There's blood on the ground!

241
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,310
What happened here?

242
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,170
Leave it?

243
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,290
Yeah, we'll just leave the blood on the ground.

244
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,170
I think that would be wise.

245
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,890
It's chained up.

246
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,330
The padlock looks a little rusty.

247
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,270
It would probably break with enough force.

248
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,310
I better go open the trunk of my car.

249
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,970
Let's put on here.

250
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,780
There's something important stored in here.

251
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,760
Open it.

252
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,380
I was bald for four years, grew my hair out, didn't want to
deal with the barbers, and went back to bald.

253
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,140
I don't blame you.

254
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,960
I don't want to be bald.

255
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,280
Hair is so much work.

256
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,000
Even if it's like ghost hair even.

257
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,020
That's even the worst because, okay, as a ghost, my...

258
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,160
Okay, you know, like...

259
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:41,740
okay as a ghost my hair wants to instinctively like go in
front of my face like i'll wake up and i'll look like you

260
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:51,320
know like samara from the ring or something i'm sadako you
know like i'm my hair just instinctively because it's a go

261
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,440
because i'm a ghost it's just the ghost hair it just
instinctively wants to go in front of me so i have to like i

262
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,020
have to style it every day for you guys to look

263
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,440
When I'm, like, done, you know, it just wants to, right in
front of my face.

264
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,520
So annoying.

265
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,600
I want to be bald, too.

266
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,840
Minto pretty.

267
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,360
Stop it.

268
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,300
Getting all dolled up for her eyeballs.

269
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,780
Maybe.

270
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,500
Maybe I want you to guys to have a good impression of me.

271
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,200
I don't know.

272
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,180
It's my box of handgum.

273
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,620
Oh, we do have the ammo.

274
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,640
Take it.

275
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,200
What else we got?

276
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,340
I've had enough.

277
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,660
Oh.

278
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,360
We're not going to shut it?

279
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,000
Or...

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,800
It's my box.

281
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,460
I have enough.

282
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,840
Shoot.

283
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,680
Shoot.

284
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,040
Oh.

285
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
Oh, that's a reload.

286
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,240
Gosh, that was loud.

287
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Sounds like so much work.

288
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,800
Your hair is really pretty, though.

289
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,400
Thanks for your efforts.

290
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,060
Of course.

291
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,040
Would you guys go to a crow-themed amusement park?

292
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,220
What's that?

293
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,500
It's a pocket light.

294
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,520
Looks like somebody dropped it.

295
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,600
Finders, keepers.

296
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,800
Exteriors.

297
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,960
Oh no, I might have to turn it on and off to hide, right?

298
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,720
What does that say?

299
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,760
It's a ticket booth.

300
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,980
I have no intention of buying a ticket.

301
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,600
Illegal activities?

302
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,320
You would!

303
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,940
Trash can.

304
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,260
It's full of trash.

305
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,060
Oh, reach in!

306
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,460
This is the most...

307
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,280
Oh, Medkit!

308
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,240
This is the most like, uh...

309
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,480
Survival horror thing ever.

310
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,320
Just reaching in toilets and trash.

311
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,740
Page from a magazine.

312
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,060
Oh!

313
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,520
Megabyte magazine.

314
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,460
Tips and tricks.

315
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,780
Okay, I've been doing RT.

316
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,680
The advantage of using RT is that it frees you up to use R
to rotate the camera.

317
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,440
Wait, what?

318
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,060
Is B not?

319
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,900
What about you?

320
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
It can rotate camera with R.

321
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,620
Oh, I get what they mean.

322
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,060
Oh, okay.

323
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,340
Also, the camera will face...

324
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,880
I was thinking of L.

325
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,800
I was thinking of L, not R.

326
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,540
Yeah, health kit in the garbage.

327
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,800
So sanitary, right?

328
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,680
Love that.

329
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,300
Especially this...

330
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,560
Who knows how long this theme park has been abandoned?

331
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
Camera will quickly face forward when you press R-B to use
your weapon.

332
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,020
Main gate.

333
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,900
Leads out to the public parking lot.

334
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,980
It's been blocked ever since they shut Crow Country.

335
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,570
This here's Crow Country.

336
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,630
And they met Kits.

337
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:29,370
full of trash I feel like I'm definitely going to get like
attacked in one of these trash cans I know how these games

338
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:39,190
work what is this whoa what is it I think of all things we
should be examining this

339
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,850
bathroom it's a door Oh,

340
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
that don't look good.

341
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,620
Oh, worst flashlight ever.

342
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,480
Doki Bird has a theme park now?

343
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,340
Oh, yeah, we can rotate the camera.

344
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,160
Ah, I see.

345
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,360
Okay, okay, I see how it works now.

346
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,140
Um, okay, RB at the ready.

347
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,420
What is this?

348
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,920
Wait, my head's blocking it, but there's something squishy
in there.

349
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,960
There's a blood on the ground.

350
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,140
Look at that, look at that.

351
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:26,760
Hey!

352
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,100
What's that?

353
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,920
It's a laser sight for a handgun.

354
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,600
Oh, sure!

355
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,160
Um, okay, we're about to get ambushed.

356
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,770
Box of ammo.

357
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,030
Okay.

358
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,210
What the?

359
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,450
Why do I have laser sight?

360
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,990
That's pretty sick.

361
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,480
I saw here there was a thing, yeah.

362
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,060
Vending machines and trash cans may provide you with
supplies if you're running low.

363
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,620
You can also get handgun ammo from the trunk of your car.

364
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,880
Which means we could just...

365
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,320
That sounds like we could just leave, no?

366
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,940
It's a urinal.

367
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,420
Doesn't look like anyone's cleaned it for a while.

368
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,880
Nasty.

369
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,740
Seems so convenient.

370
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,640
The urinal?

371
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,620
That's true, though.

372
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,700
Can I turn this off?

373
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,960
Agent Mara Forest saves the day once again.

374
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,360
How do I save in this game, by the way?

375
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,460
You hear that?

376
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,480
How's the audio, by the way?

377
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,400
It seems like it's quite...

378
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,720
Hold on.

379
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,700
Actually, it seems like it's quite low.

380
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,680
Audio is good?

381
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,560
Oh, okay, cool.

382
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,640
Who's talking?

383
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:10,730
Ugh.

384
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,510
What's this?

385
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:14,930
Money?

386
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,810
It's a toilet.

387
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,570
There's something in here, but I can't get at it.

388
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,290
It's blocked by a pile of old bones.

389
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,150
I can use my ID card.

390
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,150
That doesn't work.

391
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,130
Okay, I'll leave it.

392
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,290
Why can't I move the bones?

393
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,190
What is this?

394
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,070
A magazine.

395
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,030
Someone got skeleton eyes.

396
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,770
I hate when there's bones in my toilet.

397
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:52,490
August 1989 strange sighting at abandoned theme park
aspiring god the sound is so creepy I just want to say your

398
00:24:52,490 --> 00:25:06,460
streams and vids make me happy lollipop thank you thank you
so much really appreciate it serves me if we're not chewing

399
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:15,800
my food you're just just clogging up your intestines and the
pipes.

400
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,140
I'm clogging up both pipes.

401
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,620
Aspiring paranormal photographer Arthur Mole sent in a
polaroid he took while exploring the abandoned amusement

402
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,700
park Crow Country.

403
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,700
Someone was getting frisky with a mothman.

404
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,400
They're boundless.

405
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,460
Could this thing possibly be real?

406
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,980
Or is it just another hoax?

407
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,240
Here at Beyond Magazine, we're not convinced.

408
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,240
Try a little harder next time, Arthur.

409
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:53,040
Okay, but what actually what is that supposed to be you know
what i was on arthur's side at first because i think it's

410
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,980
kind of you know i was on his side at first but now what the
heck is that even supposed to be it looks like a guy like

411
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,040
floating in the air

412
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,300
hmm what is that sound it's horrible

413
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,260
something's blocking it

414
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:38,780
i'm getting out of here okay I did not like that I just
realized oh my gosh I was treating this as like a pure like

415
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:49,540
you know PS1 survival horror with the fixed camera angles
but it's very nice that we can move it oh what's this we can

416
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:55,320
actually move it when shooting your bullets will do more
damage if you're closer to the enemy so attempting to shoot

417
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,380
enemies from far away will use up your ammo supplies more
quickly Oh, no!

418
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,840
Sleepy Coral, welcome back!

419
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,900
Thank you!

420
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,120
Oh my gosh!

421
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,480
Hey, chill.

422
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,740
What is that?

423
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Some kind of dead animal.

424
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,380
I can't make out any features.

425
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,500
What's in here?

426
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,840
Locked from the other side.

427
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
It's locked.

428
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,030
There's a bronze keyhole.

429
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,530
Alright, for the...

430
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,170
train.

431
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,750
That is explosive.

432
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,950
This is explosive barrel.

433
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,930
Oh, okay.

434
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,710
And this guy is a big crow.

435
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,810
Hello, Mr. Crow.

436
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,150
I'm looking for your boss.

437
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,450
Do you know where he is?

438
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,980
This is also explosive.

439
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Interesting.

440
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,500
Very, very interesting.

441
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,940
Fortune telling machine.

442
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,500
You have ten credits remaining.

443
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,120
Would you like to hear your fortune?

444
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,620
Yes.

445
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,520
Talk to the tree fairy to enter the fairy pond.

446
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,740
It's a hint system?

447
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,340
Is this how I save?

448
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:16,820
No.

449
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,560
Metal pole?

450
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,840
A lot of crows around here.

451
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,760
You get 10 hints.

452
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,880
Wait, what did it say?

453
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,620
Talk to the fairy to enter the Wait, what?

454
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,900
I can't even remember.

455
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,960
Box of shotgun shells.

456
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,560
I'll take that.

457
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,020
Okay.

458
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,420
Give me a shotgun right now, baby.

459
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,460
Oh, this looks like meds, too, right?

460
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,580
Med kit.

461
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,000
I love ground med kit.

462
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,980
Humanoid enemies will take more damage if you get a
headshot.

463
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,200
Headshot also has a chance of decapitating.

464
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,540
Bonjour, mito.

465
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,620
Hope you're fine, by the way.

466
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,120
Very pretty, very black.

467
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,880
Oh, got a soda.

468
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,080
Kick it.

469
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,820
Wait for it.

470
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,240
A bottle of antidote came out.

471
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,820
My favorite drink.

472
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,880
You can quickly defeat enemies by exploding the red barrels.

473
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

474
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,440
Similarly, useful are the blue electrical generators found
on some walls.

475
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,540
Oh.

476
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,160
Staff memo.

477
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,080
I admit it.

478
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,560
I dropped the bronze key into the fairy pond!

479
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,740
It was an accident.

480
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,240
It wouldn't be such a problem if we made a spare.

481
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,700
Silver keyhole.

482
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,380
Okay, I'm just exploring everything right now first.

483
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,780
Staff memo.

484
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,240
Crow fact.

485
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,620
Did you know crows, ravens, and wolves are best friends in
the wild and work together?

486
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,200
Really?

487
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:55,760
Really?

488
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,530
Fairy pond.

489
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,830
Yeah, I want more Crowfax.

490
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,750
Thank you so much for the super chat.

491
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,470
Also, Scratch, I hope you're doing well today too.

492
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,370
Thank you.

493
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,210
There's something wrong with the ventilator in the fairy
pond area.

494
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,510
What the heck is a fairy pond?

495
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,650
We think something might have crawled into the pipe and
died.

496
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,930
Don't run the ventilator.

497
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,250
And if you do, hold your breath.

498
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,870
Oh my god.

499
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,370
What?

500
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,560
No, heckin' away.

501
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:36,820
Oh,

502
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,260
there's an antidote right here.

503
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,360
How do I know what my health is?

504
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,480
I don't have, like, a...

505
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,180
Oh, I can back up using this.

506
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,380
Okay, that's my...

507
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,520
This is run.

508
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,300
There's a backpack here, even.

509
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,020
Oh, wait.

510
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,880
Sorry, what did I say?

511
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,160
1988.

512
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,280
It's empty.

513
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,360
Did someone lose it?

514
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,080
Interesting.

515
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,000
Someone's just setting up traps.

516
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,180
There's an indicator.

517
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,520
I don't know what button is for inventory.

518
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,140
Oh, here we go.

519
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,280
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

520
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,520
Oh, we're okay.

521
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,900
It's LB for anyone curious.

522
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,220
What about this?

523
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,660
This looks like it's Breakable, no?

524
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,460
There was another one, too.

525
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,510
Fairy tale town.

526
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:58,670
2106?

527
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,110
That's just a box.

528
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,670
What's this?

529
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,090
Oh, yeah.

530
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,210
2106.

531
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,930
I think it's written in blood.

532
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,490
Is it a code for something?

533
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,870
Oh, I see that.

534
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,930
You're not getting me this time.

535
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,630
No, sir.

536
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,630
I wonder what the enemies are going to look like.

537
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,470
Well, this looks like it's from Adventure Time.

538
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:26,990
It's a giant mushroom.

539
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,770
It doesn't look very happy.

540
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:29,790
Is this a door?

541
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,130
Can't see a way to open it.

542
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,030
Well, here, the music is kind of picking up.

543
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,490
There's a guy out there.

544
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:38,930
What is this?

545
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,250
It's a keypad.

546
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,050
Oh!

547
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,530
Two, one.

548
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,950
Oh wait, there's no zero.

549
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,750
Just kidding.

550
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,660
I see legs!

551
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,280
Polaroid camera.

552
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,380
Checky!

553
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,940
I think it's broken.

554
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,260
Uh-oh.

555
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,240
Legs.

556
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,020
That don't look so good.

557
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,620
Mr?

558
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
Are you...

559
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,240
Are you possessed?

560
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,440
Talk.

561
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,180
Sir, what happened here?

562
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,660
What?

563
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,220
Who?

564
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,000
My name is Mara Forest.

565
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,780
I'm here to help.

566
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,120
They attacked me.

567
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,240
All I wanted was proof.

568
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,200
What's your name?

569
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,920
Arthur Mbal.

570
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,520
I just needed a better, a clearer photo.

571
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,080
A photo of what?

572
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,380
Who attacked you, Arthur?

573
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,200
Those things.

574
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,200
I don't know.

575
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,720
Those people, they saw me and...

576
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,540
Alright, stay calm.

577
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,860
You're bleeding quite badly.

578
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Dang!

579
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,220
How long has he been here?

580
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,000
I should help him.

581
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,240
How?

582
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,980
I'm not a doctor.

583
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,580
What did you say your name was?

584
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,580
Mara.

585
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,060
Come on.

586
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,940
I think we should take a look at your leg.

587
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,220
Give him a healing item!

588
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,840
Ravens follow wolves to eat their carry-on, or lead wolves
to prey by circling over their prey?

589
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,920
Symbiotic relationship.

590
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,970
I guess I'm medkit, right?

591
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,670
What if it was poisoned, though, by the blood of the thing?

592
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,350
Thanks.

593
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,570
I should help him.

594
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,170
I still feel kind of bad.

595
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,430
Come on, let's move you to somewhere safe.

596
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,670
You don't look too heavy.

597
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,890
Okay, we're moving, Arthur.

598
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,170
Okay.

599
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,770
To my car?

600
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,590
Carther?

601
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,490
I hope he doesn't mutate in my car.

602
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,390
That would be pretty bad.

603
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,830
I moved Arthur to my car.

604
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,050
He'll be safe there for now.

605
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,970
He's gonna rob me blind?

606
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,090
I just stole that guy's food.

607
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,060
Some creature's gonna get mad at me.

608
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Is the shirt in the thumbnail meant to...

609
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,440
Don't make fun of it!

610
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,230
Oh.

611
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,410
Did he leave?

612
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,470
Oh no.

613
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,190
This bloody pad.

614
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:51,990
Full of trash.

615
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,150
Large med kit!

616
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,450
Oh my gosh.

617
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,350
We were rewarded.

618
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,590
There's a note on the floor.

619
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,550
Tree lady.

620
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,070
I guess Arthur wrote this.

621
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,670
3184.

622
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,010
Okay.

623
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,390
Let's go do that instead.

624
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:14,890
Is it this one?

625
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:15,710
Tree lady?

626
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,210
Three, one.

627
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,790
Oh, I see her.

628
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,130
Fairy.

629
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,090
There's something in the tree.

630
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,230
It's a wooden carving of a woman.

631
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,630
She's facing the other way.

632
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,530
She's like moving.

633
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,690
She's got an idle animation.

634
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,570
What was it?

635
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,130
Three, one, eight, four?

636
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,770
She turned around.

637
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,170
I think I remember you have to talk to her?

638
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,490
There was some kind of phrase you had to say.

639
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,150
I don't remember what it was, though.

640
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,270
There... Wait, there was?

641
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:53,950
Oh.

642
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,790
I don't think I know this yet.

643
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,370
Wait, do it?

644
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,510
I don't think I know this yet.

645
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:05,910
Do I?

646
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,420
The quickest way to Tolman's office is through the fairy
pond area, right?

647
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,660
problem is I forgot how to get the stupid tree fairy to move
out of the way I guess I need a code for the keypad and then

648
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:30,100
what I'm sure it was written down somewhere maybe in crow's
lounge okay we're going to the lounge baby oh my gosh you

649
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:40,360
guys I got to go into an airport lounge for the first time
in my afterlife coming home from Japan a friend had had an

650
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,120
extra like an invite and I was able to go in I was like,
whoa!

651
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,820
It was so fancy.

652
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,160
I was like, I kind of want to always have the lounge access.

653
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,820
What's it like?

654
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,920
It was nice.

655
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,980
I just kind of sat there and there were, there were like,
um, I kept getting some sort of drink.

656
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,780
I can't remember.

657
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,080
I think it was like a, like a, one of the, like a, like a
fruity water.

658
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,940
Yeah, they have showers in there.

659
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,940
And then there was a guy who made fresh ramen or udon.

660
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,720
And then there was just like so much food.

661
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,060
And I was like, this is craziness.

662
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,520
And it was free for me because it was my friend's invite.

663
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,720
But I was like, whoa, rich people's stuff.

664
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,340
I know.

665
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,740
I feel like royalty.

666
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,240
The lounge at Haneda is so nice.

667
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,520
comfy.

668
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,900
That's the one it was.

669
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,240
Hi, Mito.

670
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,680
Thank you for visiting Florida last weekend.

671
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,160
It was amazing having you in Doki there.

672
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,580
I was the Kagami Tishiro cosplayer who asked what's the
biggest animal you could take in a fight.

673
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,800
Thank you!

674
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,760
Thank you so much.

675
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,180
Thanks for coming to see us.

676
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,540
Thank you for the super chat.

677
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,780
Do not enter.

678
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,060
Does that look like a lounge?

679
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,320
There's a med kit here.

680
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,580
Is there like an issue to picking up the med kits?

681
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,080
If I die, do I lose them?

682
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,480
Read the staff memos posted on walls around Crow Country.

683
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,080
In every save room, there is a book containing all the staff
memos you read so far.

684
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,220
Oh, that's nice.

685
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,580
What's this room?

686
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,900
Oh, theater.

687
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,760
It's a big door.

688
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,460
Let's think it's blocked from the other side.

689
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,480
She said 100 elephants because she's the strongest ghost in
the world.

690
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,380
Yeah, I Why not?

691
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,400
You can only carry so many.

692
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,200
Ah, I see.

693
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
When shooting, your bullets will do more damage if you're
closer.

694
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,460
Oh, I did read this one already.

695
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,800
Wait, what did it say?

696
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,120
Something to shoot.

697
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,040
We'll use your supply.

698
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,540
Yeah, yeah.

699
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,040
Human, oh, yeah.

700
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,060
Okay, I think there's an enemy beyond there.

701
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,980
Old cigarette machine.

702
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,060
I'm not allowed to smoke.

703
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,800
Okay.

704
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,960
Is this a save room?

705
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,500
I don't think so.

706
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,860
Happy birthday!

707
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,660
I also have to ask, do the monsters in this respawn?

708
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,420
Like how...

709
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,320
Let's just go for it.

710
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,380
Do they respawn like in other PS1 survival horror games?

711
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,520
Yes.

712
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,200
Some do.

713
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,240
Oh my god.

714
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,720
How do I shoot?

715
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Oh, oh, oh.

716
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,420
Oh my god.

717
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,600
Run away.

718
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,000
God, die already!

719
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,100
Okay, never mind, I'm leaving.

720
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,700
That was scary.

721
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh, I'm dying now.

722
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,260
Ugh!

723
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,720
Never mind.

724
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,960
Oh, whoops.

725
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,900
It's this one, right?

726
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,780
I'm injured.

727
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,020
Oh, wait.

728
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,130
Let's see.

729
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,520
I'm okay.

730
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,260
They have tanky, right?

731
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,100
What the heck?

732
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,120
Okay, so it's be the shoe in a reload.

733
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,940
There we go.

734
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Okay.

735
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,040
Can you aim up and down?

736
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,240
Oh, yes, you can.

737
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,640
Okay, yeah, you can.

738
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,060
Cosmic future coming summer 1990.

739
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,560
Here at Crow Country, we can't wait to share our optimistic
vision of the future with you.

740
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,520
Ooh, it was supposed to be finished this year.

741
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,120
happen.

742
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,300
Our dang park is overrun with zombies.

743
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,360
What is that?

744
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,740
I thought I was getting headshots on the guy, but maybe...
Oh no.

745
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,120
My depth perception strikes again, perhaps.

746
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,420
Hey, Ed.

747
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,400
When some good news?

748
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
I finally found a good site for our gold mine.

749
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,780
It's in Parra.

750
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,820
Northern Brazil.

751
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,900
Brazil mention!

752
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,880
Just like we wanted, there's a disused mine there.

753
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,820
The locals gave up on it years ago.

754
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,300
Uh...

755
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,820
It shouldn't be too much work to get it looking the part.

756
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,520
Marv.

757
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,220
Brazil.

758
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,720
Kick it.

759
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,480
What?

760
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,340
Monsters...

761
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,840
Wait, from experience, monsters don't respawn, but new ones
will spawn in rooms as you make progress through the story.

762
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,740
Got it!

763
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,360
Thank you!

764
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,280
Nothing!

765
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,540
Wait, what's he?

766
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,620
Hole in the fence.

767
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,780
Looks like it was done with wire cutters.

768
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,000
I think this is how Arthur got in.

769
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,740
Seems like he cut himself on the fence.

770
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,920
Oh, what a bozo.

771
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,560
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur.

772
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,300
We literally got in through the front door.

773
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,760
I mean, all I had to do was shoot it, but...

774
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,460
Medkit!

775
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,520
Wasting my precious medkit on Arthur when I needed it the
most.

776
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,060
Staff memo, if you're looking for the machine chain, one of
the swan boat people took it to fix a broken swan.

777
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,680
I told them not to take it.

778
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,840
And they took it anyway.

779
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,840
You can't reason with swanboat people.

780
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:42,920
So true.

781
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,080
Also, do I get like not...

782
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,840
Do I get melee weapons eventually?

783
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,880
I would like a melee weapon.

784
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:00,450
No!

785
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,470
I don't?

786
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,410
Did I look in this one?

787
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,370
I think I did.

788
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,210
I think I got the big...

789
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,090
Oh, bullets.

790
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,180
seriously not did i read this one let me check

791
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:33,260
yes the fairy tree so we need to figure out what she says or
what we need to say to her page from a magazine if you get

792
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:38,760
poison use an antidote as soon as you can large med kits
also contain antidotes but you might wish to use them

793
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,240
sparingly i see what is this oh this a jug.

794
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,620
Oh, there's something here, too.

795
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:45,900
What's in here?

796
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,660
It's a set of stairs.

797
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,550
The swan!

798
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,500
We found it.

799
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,740
It's been broken.

800
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,160
I want to know how to repair it.

801
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,560
A wheel.

802
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,580
Pretty sure it's broken.

803
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,120
This one looks intact, though.

804
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,540
It doesn't turn.

805
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,100
There's a strange mechanical swan head.

806
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,600
Do I need to put something in its mouth?

807
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,240
My ID?

808
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,620
There's a hole in the fence.

809
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,600
I can reach the edge of the water.

810
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:31,390
What's that?

811
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,610
Shotgun?

812
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,790
They're teasing me.

813
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,470
They're absolutely teasing me.

814
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:37,830
Staff memo.

815
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,730
So the eggs are going missing.

816
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,530
I think the kids are stealing them.

817
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,330
The Mara Forest ID.

818
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,250
Maybe he wants my...

819
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,110
Maybe he wants...

820
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,270
Maybe the Swan wants...

821
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,070
Uh...

822
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:52,790
Once...

823
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,790
to

824
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,050
open a credit card.

825
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,030
Luckily, it turns out you can use anything as long as it's
about the right size and shape.

826
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,990
Oh, it's for the egg, for the mouth.

827
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:11,650
It's weird.

828
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,410
I assume that the eggs were magnetic or something, but
apparently not.

829
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,950
What would be a similar size to an egg year?

830
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,790
If a swan breaks down, just take the egg out of its wheel
system.

831
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,730
Doing so, disables the radio signal and locks the wheels
until you can get the mechanic out to fix it.

832
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,950
I don't think I understand what this is.

833
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,770
Do you guys?

834
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,730
Do you guys know what kind of attraction this is?

835
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,370
Do you control the swans?

836
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,480
RC swan.

837
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,040
But then what do you do?

838
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,500
Do you avoid the baby ducks?

839
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,740
It's like a merry-go-go-go-go.

840
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,580
go around on water.

841
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,300
Newspaper.

842
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,800
The Atlanta Globe.

843
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,460
May 1986.

844
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,740
Crow Country Theme Park.

845
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,680
Opening soon.

846
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,860
Cancel your weekend plans with the in-laws and grab your
sunglasses.

847
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,260
A brand new theme park is opening just a few miles southeast
of Atlanta.

848
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,680
What is up with Atlanta?

849
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,100
Why is that place so stinking cursed?

850
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,620
You got the Walking Dead.

851
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:41,260
You got the country what why are things always happening in
atlanta i

852
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:52,930
mean i guess with the walking dead it's like the cdc but
still should be ohio

853
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:09,330
georgia is a different dimension literal twilight zone over
there like what's happening karma for being unwalkable that

854
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:20,990
sounds like a it's literally the walking dead they walked
everywhere, Berrybug I think it's pretty walkable it's not

855
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,250
called the driving dead

856
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:39,940
Sergeant, welcome to Mambujib Thank you the car commuting
dead explore a fairy tale town haunted hilltop an ocean

857
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:45,720
kingdom at country, which promises a day full of fun and
adventure for the whole family.

858
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,860
Lots of scary stuff happens in Atlanta, like Phantom Thief's
Revenge Concert.

859
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,520
Yeah, exactly.

860
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:01,680
The park is owned by one Mr. Edward Crow, a lifelong Atlanta
local and landowner.

861
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,860
Yes, that's right.

862
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,280
It appears he named the park after himself.

863
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,180
Okay, but that's not so unusual.

864
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,500
What?

865
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,940
We're going to shame Mr. Crow for naming the park after
himself.

866
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,760
but Walt Disney gets a pass?

867
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:16,540
Okay.

868
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,260
Sure, Jan.

869
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,940
Not much is known about Mr. Crow other than vague,
unsubstantiated reports that he is exceptionally wealthy.

870
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,940
Nonetheless, we look forward to seeing what Crow Country has
to offer when it opens its gates this summer.

871
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:33,800
Exciting.

872
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,720
Okay, so we gotta go get something that's like the shape of
an egg year.

873
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,960
I also need to learn how to aim so I can uh...

874
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,960
Did I open this guy?

875
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,260
Soda?

876
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,660
I wonder if a soda can will do!

877
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,700
It's kind of the shape of an egg, right?

878
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,030
Use item... Wait, where's my soda can?

879
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,380
I took it, right?

880
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,640
garbage.

881
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,140
I don't care.

882
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,180
We're in a horror game.

883
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,260
We use everything.

884
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,440
Take the antidote.

885
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,380
Mara threw it away.

886
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,900
I thought I literally found something.

887
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,520
You.

888
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,000
You.

889
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:44,380
You.

890
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,620
Oh, that was the club.

891
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,960
I juke that thing like crazy.

892
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,060
Oh, yeah.

893
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,700
Holy cow.

894
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,280
What about a cigarette?

895
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,980
No?

896
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,780
Guys, I'm scared.

897
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,040
This game makes me want to listen to Resident Evil 2 OST.

898
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:15,300
This game makes me want to listen to Resident Evil OST
basement.

899
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,700
Wow.

900
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,540
Wow.

901
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,120
Wow.

902
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:19,460
Wow.

903
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,000
Wow.

904
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:20,740
Wow.

905
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,280
Wow.

906
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,640
You can shoot bear traps and obstacles.

907
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,540
Thank you.

908
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,380
I think I might need to do that here because otherwise...

909
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:35,760
Oh, whoops.

910
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,240
I'm scared that I will...

911
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:40,920
Laser sight.

912
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,720
Laser sight.

913
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,740
What was...

914
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,320
Okay, it's B.

915
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:48,560
Mara!

916
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,480
Mara, I need you to focus, girl.

917
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:51,840
Mara!

918
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,870
Okay, we got it.

919
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:55,780
Awesome.

920
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,420
Alright, I wish I could save.

921
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,520
The aiming seems very sensitive.

922
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,020
I wonder if there's a way to change it.

923
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,460
Controls?

924
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,240
Grenade!

925
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,200
Quick 180 turn.

926
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,300
Oh.

927
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,970
Baby needs assist.

928
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:32,770
Maybe.

929
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:34,190
Maybe.

930
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:34,530
I do?

931
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,600
I'm gonna also change shoot reload.

932
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,600
Yeah, I think I would do better if I'm shooting with X and
I'll...

933
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:51,820
What?

934
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,720
I don't know.

935
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,840
You would think Metal Gear would make me want to shoot with
O.

936
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,920
I think this makes more sense though, right?

937
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,080
Raise weapon, shoot.

938
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,120
Reload, switch weapon.

939
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,820
Switch weapon.

940
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,220
Okay.

941
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,380
We'll learn that later.

942
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,000
Interesting.

943
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,680
I didn't see a...

944
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,600
Aim assist is recommended in top-down games.

945
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,980
I'm not gonna lie.

946
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,740
My depth perception in this type of stuff is like pretty
tricky.

947
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,380
But I'll do my best, you know.

948
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,140
Okay, let's go.

949
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,660
I hope he's not like waiting for me.

950
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,860
I can't also tell what the head is.

951
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,720
There were two of them, though.

952
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,680
I saw...

953
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,970
It'd be really nice about a shotgun.

954
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,420
Maybe?

955
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,380
Do I stomp him?

956
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,540
Stomp him!

957
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:10,900
No.

958
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,940
Oh, that thing's big.

959
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,300
Oh, that thing's big.

960
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,240
Wait, guys.

961
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,480
That thing's pretty big.

962
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,540
Oh, I decapitated it.

963
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,140
Oh, I took it down.

964
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,320
Ah!

965
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,180
Let's go.

966
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,540
It's dead.

967
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:27,500
Ugh.

968
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,180
It smells so bad like an infected wound.

969
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,660
I feel bad killing it.

970
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,580
But I feel bad leaving it alive too.

971
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,480
And just...

972
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:38,540
Just...

973
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,020
Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

974
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,680
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

975
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,060
Pretty spooky in here, guys.

976
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,160
That's why you're the best, boss.

977
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,320
I'm doing my best.

978
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,440
That's all I can do.

979
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,000
Wouldn't say I'm the best.

980
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,520
I'm just doing my best.

981
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,700
Did they come from a mummy's curse?

982
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,220
What was that?

983
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,940
It's a wooden crate.

984
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,180
There's a note taped to the lid.

985
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,320
Ship to Marvin Trumbull.

986
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:15,820
Brazil!

987
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,300
Content samples of geological interest.

988
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,640
I'm so sorry, Marvin.

989
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,940
We just doxed you.

990
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm so sorry, I just doxed you, Marvin.

991
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,300
Open it!

992
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,440
What do you mean open it?

993
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:41,160
full of racks each one is embedded with pieces of shiny
metal metal is this a crate full of gold ore maybe not poor

994
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:59,000
Marvin glass it's a staff memo did you guys watch Apollo you
guys watch Apollo the bird when I recommended him if this is

995
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,900
your first time seeing me.

996
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Hello.

997
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,100
I recommend a bird named Apollo.

998
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:08,060
His owners give him things and they're like, what is this
made of Apollo?

999
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,520
And he goes, metal.

1000
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,600
Or glass.

1001
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:16,250
Staff memo.

1002
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,230
Can I ask why the dig site access is that cute little house?

1003
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,230
Don't you think there's a chance that some kid would want to
go looking in there?

1004
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:29,030
At the very least, let's keep it locked via the keyhole on
the mailbox.

1005
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,010
I see it.

1006
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:33,850
There's like a lot of sounds.

1007
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:34,630
Oh, a vent.

1008
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,070
Is there something inside?

1009
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,070
I hear something, though, no?

1010
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,070
I'm scared.

1011
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:58,740
Nothing.

1012
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,140
If you're using Deepak to move, you can do a 180 quick turn.

1013
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:07,820
Okay, yeah.

1014
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,220
Nice.

1015
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:11,900
What's this?

1016
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:12,820
Notebook.

1017
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,360

1022
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,160
All security doors down to the pool are locked.

1023
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,380
Check security records.

1024
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,980
Doors untouched since 6 p.m.

1025
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,500
on Friday.

1026
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,060
Alarm has only just been triggered.

1027
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,260
I turn on the intercom.

1028
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,280
Try to communicate.

1029
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,220
No response.

1030
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,840
But I can hear the sound he's making.

1031
00:57:59,280 --> 00:57:59,960
Something is wrong.

1032
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,080
His clothes don't fit him.

1033
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,240
Something is very wrong.

1034
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,340
It's an ashtray.

1035
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,320
I'm surprised this whole place hasn't burned down.

1036
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,080
Also, this is like the coziest room ever, no?

1037
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:16,600
Bookshelf.

1038
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,300
Mining your own business.

1039
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,960
Economics of the mining industry.

1040
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,180
Joseph's got a sense of humor.

1041
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,300
Oh, here it is.

1042
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,840
Remember to get into the great pond, or the fairy pond area.

1043
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,320
Say this out loud to the fairy.

1044
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,940
Hear me, oh great fairy of fairest forest.

1045
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,160
Hear me, oh great fairy of fairest forest.

1046
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,800
I'm pretty sensitive, so it won't work if you have an
accent.

1047
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:49,840
Sorry, Diego.

1048
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,540

Magazine?

1052
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,470
It's a collection of video game tips.

1053
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:12,370
Oh, they did say that we would have the whole thing.

1054
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,170
Oh, a map.

1058
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,370
It's a curious mixture of hope and dread.

1059
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,990
Maybe everything will be okay.

1060
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,190
Maybe it won't.

1061
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:56,830
Oh!

1062
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,310

Cabinet.

There's a keypad.

1068
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,130
This one doesn't also have zero.

1069
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:17,610
Huh.

1070
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,170
Fires appear to be safe.

1071
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:20,730
Safe points.

1072
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,720
8008.

1073
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,440
It must be.

1074
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:30,180
It must be.

1075
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:39,120
State Court 185 Central Avenue, Southwest Atlanta, Georgia,
30303 United States.

1076
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,640
Legal summons.

Oh my gosh.

I know some of you watching here are from Atlanta.

1079
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:45,960
Go.

1080
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,200
Go and go to this place.

1081
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,000
It's Oshikats.

1082
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,060
Terry, hello.

1083
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,330
This is Oshikats, right now.

1084
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:09,570
Dear Mr. Crow, I am writing to you in relation to the
incident which occurred within your theme park in July of

1085
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:10,170
1988.

1086
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,190
As you know, a 15-year-old girl by the name of Elaine
Marshall was injured.

1087
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:15,830
Ooh.

1088
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:21,090
I think she's the enemy.

1089
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:25,110
The incident occurred within your premises, within working
hours.

1090
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:27,750
As such, the Marshall family is holding you personal
responsible.

1091
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,130
Your presence is required in court.

1092
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,230
We expect to hear from you immediately.

1093
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:36,310
Antidote.

1094
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,650
I wonder how many I can carry.

1095
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,670
Oh there's also a health kit.

1096
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,840
Awesome, possum.

1097
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,580
Oh yeah, what?

1098
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,700
Oh sorry, what was it?

1099
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,380
Hear me, oh great fairy of Ferris forest.

1100
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:55,880
Okay.

1101
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,800
Let's go do it.

1102
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,690
I miss... I miss the comfy...

1103
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:10,280
I miss the comfy room.

1104
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,980
It was crawling, wasn't it?

1105
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,380
Oh my gosh.

1106
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:17,480
What?

1107
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:17,800
Oh.

1108
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,000
Oh!

1109
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,240
Oh!

1110
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,540
That's some fancy shooting.

1111
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,380
If I do say so myself.

1112
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,160
Ah!

1113
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,500
There's another one.

1114
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:35,020
More!

1115
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:35,840
Oh my god.

1116
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:36,480
Please.

1117
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:39,600
Oh my god.

1118
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,160
I have to lock in like crazy.

1119
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,220
And stay dead.

1120
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,300
You nasty critters, you.

1121
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,920
What was that?

1122
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,880
Oh my god.

1123
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:04,980
There's creatures now.

1124
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,220
Oh my god, there's creatures everywhere.

1125
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,420
Oh my god.

1126
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,560
How am I supposed to talk to the great fairy if there's
critters all over the place trying to get me

1127
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,240

injured, but...

1133
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,430
I'm not poisoned or anything.

1134
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,820
I just didn't expect a...

1135
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,260
Yeah.

1136
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:25,800
Wait, so what did I say?

1137
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,380
Enemies aren't actually very aggressive.

1138
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,380
They won't chase you as long as you maintain your distance.

1139
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,340
Oh, cool.

1140
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,700
Thank you.

1141
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,080
Zelda vibes!

1142
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,500
I was like, it the same thing!

1143
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,000
Those who seek the truth stare into the pure reflective
water of our fairy bar.

1144
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,440
I'm looking.

1145
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:42,960
It's filthy.

1146
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,180
It's not pure or nor reflective.

1147
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,040
Oh, what does this say?

1148
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,340
Read the gameplay tips, post it on the walls, every saver.

1149
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:51,900
Yeah, okay.

1150
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,120
Maybe we've found most of these.

1151
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:57,980
Staff memo.

1152
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,340
So the guy who fixed the water filter did it by running it
through the air ventilation system.

1153
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:09,640
If you run the filter pump behind the curtain, with the
incorrect pressure, too high or too low, it'll trigger the

1154
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,040
ventilator.

1155
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:10,540
Be careful.

1156
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,980
You can tighten up the pressure using the valve handle.

1157
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:17,900
Okay.

1158
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:25,120
i wish they would give me less antidote more health control
box ventilator override do not touch

1159
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,820
okay there's also in here

1160
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,660
uh okay

1161
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:58,300
we were warned about poison in the ventilator so true you're
right however i am aggressive and will Listen to this to...

1162
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,200
JV!

1163
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,640
Actually, I expect nothing less of you.

1164
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,020
Where are we?

1165
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:15,600
Okay, never mind, our map is kind of stinky.

1166
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,840
You guys see that?

1167
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,820
What's going on in here?

1168
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:32,660
Ammo.

1169
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:37,420
Reload?

1170
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,640
Yeah, you guys saw the door, right?

1171
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,170
Fire extinguisher?

1172
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:46,170
Nothing's on fire.

1173
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,730
What's it say here?

1174
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,870
Who took the Ocean Kingdom restaurant?

1175
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:53,250
Trident?

1176
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,890
That thing is expensive!

1177
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,670
And without it, we can't do the happy birthday sea monster
song!

1178
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,610
Someone said they saw it in the Witchwood.

1179
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:04,250
I'd go check, but that place gives me the creeps, honestly.

1180
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:06,570
Fair?

1181
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:07,010
Valid?

1182
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:12,490
I think I will heal because our girl's looking a little.

1183
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:15,630
Witchwood?

1184
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:17,850
That wood.

1185
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,300
I know you're behind there.

1186
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:35,980
Oh!

1187
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,060
It's a wall.

1188
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,260
I can hear something behind it.

1189
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,500
Is this also a wall?

1190
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,900
It's a panel in the wall.

1191
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,120
Whoa!

1192
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,980
It's a model of a crow with rope.

1193
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:58,020
The very last time I went to the theater with Ophelia, we
saw an action movie about a cybernetic man from the future.

1194
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,580
I really, I didn't really get it, but she loved it.

1195
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,460
She wouldn't stop talking about it.

1196
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,300
CC, Terminator?

1197
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,240
When did Terminator come out?

1198
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,740
Hello, mean crawl.

1199
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,700
I'm the crow now!

1200
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,880
What am I stacking on?

1201
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,140
I'm not stacking on anything.

1202
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:19,980
I do have here, it's like a, it's like a, I'm not a
smoothie.

1203

to Edward.

1206
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,660
I thought he was going to propose with it.

1207
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,800
Would you like a behind-the-scenes tour where you get to see
inside?

1208
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,680
Yes!

1209
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,980
Show me the animatronics.

1210
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,900
I want to see the big guy.

1211
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:11,120
I want to see the Peace Walker that was basically created by
the Imagineers.

1212
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,820
I love endoskeletons.

1213
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:24,810
I have to go Thanks for sticking around, Mobius!

1214
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:25,510
Otamindo!

1215
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:37,830
I was going to propose it to Edward as a new themed area of
the park After I lost Ophelia, I shelved the project Lost

1216
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:49,530
Hal Wait, look closer I think the eye is made from a laser
sight Magnum laser Magnum laser Magnum laser Wait, what is

1217
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:49,990
that for?

1218
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,120
Shotgun shells.

1219
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,240
Wait, so did that upgrade my gun?

1220
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,400
How do I...

1221
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,140
Doesn't seem like...

1222
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:13,270
Doesn't seem like it upgraded.

1223
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:13,910
Anything?

1224
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:14,310
Did it?

1225
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:17,510
Different gun.

1226
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:18,650
Okay.

1227
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:22,730
Watch for the metal bearer.

1228
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,990
traps lying on the ground.

1229
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,190
You can set them off from a safe distance with a single
handgun bullet.

1230
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:27,870
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1231
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:30,710
Yes, we do know.

1232
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,520
I'm afraid of... I don't know how to do this.

1233
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,980
I'm afraid of setting it off and dying.

1234
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,160
You know...

1235
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:49,740
If you run the filter pipe behind the curtain with the
incorrect pressure, it'll trigger the ventilator.

1236
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:50,500
Ventilator.

1237
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,080
How am I...

1238
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,080
How am I supposed to know?

1239
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,040
The way Mara walks is so And look at her.

1240
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:00,020
She's like, she's like, I'm a bad bitch.

1241
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,420
And I'm going to take care of these things.

1242
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,380
Can you move the curtain?

1243
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,760
Oh, that's right.

1244
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,660
Move the curtain.

1245
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:10,260
Oh.

1246
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,100
So it needs to be.

1247
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:17,620
Well, it needs to be at the white.

1248
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,240
I'm assuming, right?

1249
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:22,580
Okay.

1250
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:28,250
Oh, well.

1251
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:28,430
Oops.

1252
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:29,310
Oh!

1253
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:30,330
What happened?

1254
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:31,470
Ouch.

1255
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:33,030
No, no, no.

1256
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,930
I'm getting stuck.

1257
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:35,490
Pull the lever!

1258
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:36,290
Oops.

1259
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:38,990
Oh, uh, I'm dying.

1260
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:40,470
My bad.

1261
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:41,810
Wait.

1262
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:43,090
Oops.

1263
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:46,750
Uh.

1264
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,410
Oh.

1265
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,350
I'm poisoned.

1266
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,130
I kept getting stuck on the wall!

1267
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,910
Uh, I think I'm about to die.

1268
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:07,630
Get in the water!

1269
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:14,390
Wait, can I fix it with this?

1270
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:20,530
Oh my god, I almost died.

1271
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,030
Wait.

1272
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:25,590
Oh, we're fine.

1273
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,630
I thought it was like one of those, like, oh, you just died.

1274
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,700
I was ready to accept death!

1275
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,360
I was accepting my fate!

1276
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,680
Okay, we're gonna have to tighten it quite a bit then.

1277
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,740
Alright, valve.

1278
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:56,940
Tighten.

1279
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,130
Yippee!

1280
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:06,870
Okay!

1281
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,290
I was ready to accept it.

1282
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,130
I truly was.

1283
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:15,090
Reflecting pool.

1284
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,280
But I see this guy down here.

1285
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,600
Do I...

1286
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,500
Do I shoot it?

1287
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,720
Or do I shoot... Is it this thing?

1288
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:30,020
Right?

1289
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,660
What does it say again?

1290
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:36,940
Those who seek the truth stare into the pure reflective
water of our fairy pond.

1291
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,240
Let's try the target first.

1292
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:39,780
Oh, oops.

1293
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,220
I can see it.

1294
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:44,820
Alright.

1295
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:46,680
Ah!

1296
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,100
Oh, my God.

1297
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,460
It's the fairy from the tree!

1298
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,660
She's holding a key.

1299
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,000
Bronze key.

1300
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:57,640
Why did I?

1301
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,020
I didn't become a ghost, avoiding poison.

1302
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,700
Me too likely.

1303
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,320
Oh, whoops, my bad.

1304
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,240
What needed a bronze key?

1305
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,280
Oh my gosh, there's so many things already.

1306
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:22,070
Mara will talk to the fairy of the inspector.

1307
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,960
I don't think so.

1308
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:45,800
as soon as i leave here there's going to be lots of monsters
i think i'm going to heal again i'm scared of running out of

1309
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:56,220
healing stuff maybe i should have done the large med kit
because it has the antidote in it too oh well we're fine can

1310
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:03,580
you shoot the other thing the thing that this this thing i
think this it's so i think what it did is i shot this and it

1311
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,120
bounced and hit this or something.

1312
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,120
I don't want to, like, waste bullets, though.

1313
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:10,650
I think we're okay.

1314
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,870
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1315
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,090
Alright, cool.

1316
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,080
Stay away from me.

1317
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,330
Stay back.

1318
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:27,270
Stay back.

1319
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,010
What is that?

1320
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,390
Like, a pile of food?

1321
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,050
What even is that?

1322
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:32,270
Garbage?

1323
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:34,290
Garbage monster?

1324
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,910
I don't like that sound at all.

1325
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:44,470
Oh, my God.

1326
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,050
What the hell is that?

1327
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,200
I'm just going to go the other way.

1328
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,550
Uh, bronze key.

1329
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:53,390
Uh.

1330
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:55,870
There's a hole.

1331
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:58,250
Doesn't work.

1332
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,010
Let's turn off my light real quick.

1333
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:02,890
Um.

1334
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:04,450
Lanky boy.

1335
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:06,570
Yeah, that guy is, uh...

1336
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:07,650
He got some legs.

1337
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:13,190
I wish I could move my camera upwards.

1338
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:14,450
Like, I kind of hate you.

1339
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,830
this.

1340
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:22,090
You see, it's camping where I need to go?

1341
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:23,630
Where am I, anyway?

1342
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:25,790
I'm in here.

1343
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,870
There's a few more doors down here.

1344
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:29,050
Let's go check them out.

1345
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:33,010
Oh, was it this one?

1346
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:34,730
Maybe.

1347
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:36,230
Bronze!

1348
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:38,490
It was.

1349
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,140
Oh.

1350
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,760
What's going on in here?

1351
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,840
What the heck?

1352
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,920
Is it going to get mad at me if it hits me?

1353
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,600
Oh no, they're above me.

1354
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,520
Train gate.

1355
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,080
Puzzle room, yeah.

1356
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,040
Cute.

1357
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,200
What is this?

1358
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:04,900
A curtain.

1359
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,060
It's a computer?

1360
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:07,660
Oh!

1361
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,480
Access to night.

1362
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,740
There's a slot for a disc.

1363
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:11,840
My ID!

1364
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:12,920
No.

1365
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,460
It's the sun.

1366
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,820
The fire is crackling softly.

1367
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,840
to the flames, I feel something.

1368
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:21,400
Oh!

1369
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:22,660
Oh!

1370
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:23,700
Oh!

1371
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,420
I'm gonna do a smile too.

1372
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,440
Where is Shikari and Nozomi when you need them?

1373
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,220
So true!

1374
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:41,760
Just to say, there is no reason you have to defeat enemies,
but if you leave them, you may have a harder time traveling

1375
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,620
around later on.

1376
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,120
I don't like the sound of that.

1377
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,120
They're literally like there's gonna be more of them later.

1378
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,580
You will be overrun, probably.

1379
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,400
What's this?

1380
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,040
It's a train.

1381
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,980
Oh, nope, it's a handgun ammo.

1382
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:04,260
I like this vampire on the wall.

1383
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,620
Very Nimi Nightmare Coden.

1384
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,680
Edward Crowe, the Trailblazer.

1385
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,220
Yeah, I'll just leave that there.

1386
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,580
Tooman, the mole.

1387
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,440
That's a grenade.

1388
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,180
Wait, there's a grenade inside.

1389
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,740
That has to be a grenade.

1390
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:22,940
What?

1391
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:23,360
What?

1392
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,240
What?

1393
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,080
Who are you?

1394
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,300
Douglas Pike, the builder.

1395
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,500
Natalie Crow, Autumn's Child.

1396
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:41,500
The computer systems in both the railway room and the
dungeon now need the security disk to access.

1397
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,920
Yes, I know it's inconvenient, but these are the new
regulations.

1398
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:48,640
Shoot the glass.

1399
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,060
It won't explode.

1400
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,320
Well, I just saved, so if I die...

1401
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,410
It's a grenade.

1402
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:02,390
Grenade!

1403
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:07,630
I've been thinking, can I shoot these two then?

1404
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,510
I don't want to waste my ammo.

1405
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,110
I can!

1406
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:16,230
I've been thinking about it this whole time!

1407
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,830
This is why I wanted melee.

1408
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,030
So I could beat it up.

1409
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:26,050
Orion's Odyssey, 1935.

1410
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:30,450
Our grandest steam engine, elegantly combining all four
design styles.

1411
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:34,390
During the war, it was used by the military to carry
artillery.

1412
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,120
Tollman's records.

1413
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,620
You see another grenade?

1414
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:45,860
Wait, hold on.

1415
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,300
I'll come back to this.

1416
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,720
Oh, I see it!

1417
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,200
How did you guys see that?

1418
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,200
I thought it was part of the train.

1419
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,560
March 23rd, 1988.

1420
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,700
in the lab.

1421
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,640
Boss is calling him the guest.

1422
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:09,540
I told him that was in poor taste, but it stuck.

1423
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,480
Do you want us to visit the courthouse after the stream?

1424
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,500
Traffic kind of asked for it, though.

1425
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,720
I'll go with my vid cosplay.

1426
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,840
After stream, right?

1427
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,160
I want you to hang around.

1428
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:26,840
Did anyone look it up?

1429
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,760
Is it a real address?

1430
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:38,350
The devs were like, mmm, courthouse in Atlanta.

1431
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:39,090
address.

1432
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:41,310
It is!

1433
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,760
Wait, you could actually go!

1434
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,280
Oh, she gots.

1435
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,540
That's crazy.

1436
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,800
Offered guest food and water.

1437
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,480
He took no notice of either.

1438
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,680
I can't begin to describe what's wrong with him.

1439
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,560
Boss doesn't want to call an ambulance.

1440
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,060
He doesn't want to call anyone.

1441
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,360
I suggested we shut down all root excavation.

1442
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,220
Just until we work out what's happened.

1443
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:18,500
Boss says we can't shut down just yet, so the machines are
back on.

1444
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,020
I have a bad feeling.

1445
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,760
I think we're about to make things worse.

1446
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:29,620
Okay, so let's see what these things do here.

1447
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:31,800
Train gate.

1448
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,520
Oh, the Earl of Edgecomb.

1449
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:42,360
A fine steam engine, beautifully combining the Arabella and
the and Bernadette design styles.

1450
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,100
The Duke of Farnham.

1451
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:58,840
1927.

1452
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:03,780
A handsome steam engine, stylish combining the Arabella and
Delilah design styles.

1453
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:17,780
There's nothing on them, but I also can't move or anything
when...

1454
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,500
Okay.

1455
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,540
So we have to get...

1456
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,740
We have to get...

1457
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,900
I'm so glad that it's unlimited saves.

1458
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,580
Not like you have to find a cassette to save, stupid.

1459
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,060
We have to get a disc for the computer.

1460
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:43,860
Train room.

1461
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,420
Oh, it says save.

1462
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:46,080
Oh, that's nice.

1463
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,240
Limited saves her.

1464
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,020
It dies.

1465
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,340
This puzzle cannot be solved until later.

1466
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,320
That's what I thought.

1467
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:14,060
so um but I'm also not quite sure what I need to do why are
swan oh swan boats circled because I need to still find you

1468
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:22,160
think I could put a grenade in the mouth it's like an egg
right I

1469
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:30,710
don't think it'll let me so

1470
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:36,050
That sounds logical.

1471
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:43,090
Oh my god, I don't like this sound at all.

1472
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,070
Open from the other side.

1473
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:54,250
Uh, oh, uh, everything else I could open.

1474
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,280
Wonder if I could bait this guy and shoot him with the
barrel.

1475
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,660
Where is he now actually?

1476
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,440
Is he even still over there?

1477
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:21,220
there's also see like i saw this one earlier there's
something in there hot dog indeed and then this thing oh

1478
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:31,580

defunct land narrator voice describing this place yeah

01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:49,700

1482
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:20,620

1483
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,200
Oh my god.

1484
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,020
Is he coming?

1485
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:25,820
Oh, he's coming.

1486
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:27,100
Oh, he's coming.

1487
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,620
Let's shoot here.

1488
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,080
Oh my god, please.

1489
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:35,480
Where is he?

1490
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:36,680
Sir?

1491
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:38,140
Hello?

1492
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,120
Is he coming the other way?

1493
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,340
Is he baiting me?

1494
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,140
Oh, oh lord.

1495
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,300
He's right there.

1496
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,580
Stuck on the house, I think, actually.

1497
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,380
Actually, I think he's stuck on the house.

1498
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,880
Oh, he's stuck on the house.

1499
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,620
Oh, my God.

1500
01:25:59,760 --> 01:25:59,880
Ah!

1501
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:00,760
God!

1502
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,100
Don't look that way.

1503
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,420
Oh, my God.

1504
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:07,760
Ah!

1505
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:10,220
He was too far away.

1506
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,920
Um, I'm not very good at this, guys.

1507
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,100
Uh, I think I might have missed out.

1508
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,800
How, uh, I think I gotta bathe him, like, this way.

1509
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,840
And turn around and do this.

1510
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:25,560
Maybe...

1511
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,320
Oh my god, wait.

1512
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:27,740
Oh!

1513
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,040
I got him!

1514
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,260
Oh, I got him!

1515
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:31,740
Oh!

1516
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:32,140
Oh,

1517
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,200
the music stopped!

1518
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,600
Kick it!

1519
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,000
And...

1520
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,380
Nothing.

1521
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,980
He was like looking in here.

1522
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,980
Oh, he wanted me to use the barrels.

1523
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,320
See, I need it!

1524
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,440
I need it to come over here!

1525
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:05,090
I knew he was camping.

1526
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:06,690
I'm gonna go save.

1527
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:07,750
I'm scared.

1528
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:12,110
Save's coming.

1529
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:13,590
It's fine.

1530
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:18,230
She's gaming.

1531
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:20,030
We're gaming, baby!

1532
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:24,590
My man was literally made out of popsicle sticks, but that's
okay.

1533
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,150
Yeah, don't worry about it.

1534
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:30,930
Okay, new area.

1535
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:41,840
I'm gonna...

1536
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,280
Oh, Medkit.

1537
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,700
I'll take it.

1538
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,200
I don't like the music though.

1539
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:52,660
Why?

1540
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,980
I killed the- there was no music after I killed a guy!

1541
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,300
Haunted Hilltop!

1542
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,320
Oh yeah.

1543
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,790
We need another map for this area.

1544
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,750
It's like I'm at home.

1545
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:22,610
Obviously.

1546
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:24,570
Yeah.

1547
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,730
Why do I hear gunshots over here?

1548
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:29,750
What's this say?

1549
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:30,430
Signpost.

1550
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:31,170
The dungeon?

1551
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:32,830
Witchwood?

1552
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:36,290
Wait, there was something in Witchwood we needed, no?

1553
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:38,690
Haunted Manor, The Crypt.

1554
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:42,210
There was something in Witchwood.

1555
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,380
Excuse me.

1556
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:53,880
You guys hear that?

1557
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,400
The Trident.

1558
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,140
wooden notice board.

1559
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,400
Oh, there's a map.

1560
01:28:59,780 --> 01:28:59,780
Nice.

1561
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:00,260
Okay.

1562
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,600
We take those.

1563
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:10,240
Oh!

1564
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,360
Oh, you're like human, I think.

1565
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,240
I'm not allowed to smoke.

1566
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,440
Hello?

1567
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,500
Uh, what are you doing?

1568
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,500
Trying to get through this door.

1569
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:28,740
Oh, right.

1570
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:29,800
Is it locked?

1571
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:30,880
Obviously.

1572
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,360
Is there another way around?

1573
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:35,820
It's possible.

1574
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:36,720
Right.

1575
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:38,620
I'll go have a look.

1576
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,400
Have you seen any of the monsters about?

1577
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,060
Please be careful around the haunted manor bookcases.

1578
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,900
Read the book titles carefully.

1579
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,920
In fact, it'd be easier if you just didn't touch them at
all, okay?

1580
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,000
Ah.

1581
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,420
Why do I hear banging over here too, though?

1582
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:10,080
I think the sound design is just a little funky.

1583
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,700
A little funny.

1584
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,220
Kick it!

1585
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:20,600
Uh-oh.

1586
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:21,560
Do

1587
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:34,980
it or not?

1588
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:36,500
Okay.

1589
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,240
It was...

1590
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:39,940
Witchwood.

1591
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,240
Is the one over...

1592
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:43,340
Somewhere.

1593
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:45,660
It's actually quite confusing.

1594
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:49,140
Last bottles with red caps can be broken.

1595
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,080
with a single handgun bullet.

1596
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:56,520
Oh yeah, I have my grenade now.

1597
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,960
I think I press X to use it.

1598
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,240
Oh, just kidding.

1599
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,560
Maybe I have to switch it out.

1600
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,260
Maybe.

1601
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,840
It's a real grenade.

1602
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,940
It's a real grenade.

1603
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:16,700
Yeah, the handy barrel, but I don't know if I should...

1604
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,980
Do those barrels respawn?

1605
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,220
Because if I don't, I don't want to wait.

1606
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,420
on a tiny guy like this, you know?

1607
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,240
We'll have to aim first with it.

1608
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:25,180
Oh.

1609
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,160
Oh, I see!

1610
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,560
Oh, like, aim like that.

1611
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:46,410
Understood.

1612
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:53,710
Oh, shoot.

1613
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:54,710
Reload.

1614
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:57,370
Woo!

1615
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:00,510
It's scary.

1616
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:05,930
What is that in there?

1617
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:06,810
I can't tell.

1618
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:11,330
Rapid fire.

1619
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:12,550
I didn't panic.

1620
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:14,030
I never panic.

1621
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:18,150
You've been doing maintenance in the haunted manner, trying
to access Ocean Kitchen.

1622
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:18,990
Kingdom.

1623
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:22,350
Kitchen.

1624
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:26,390
You'll need to crank the handle.

1625
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:29,730
It's locked in the safe in the southeast utility corridor.

1626
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:32,230
The code for the safe is something to do with the crypt, I
think.

1627
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:35,650
Uh...

1628
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:38,810
Okay, I need more ammo, don't I?

1629
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:43,520
Oh!

1630
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,490
He's hooting and hollering!

1631
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:57,850
He seems like he hoots five times and then stops.

1632
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,230
Is he supposed to be an owl?

1633
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:00,730
He shaved more like a bell.

1634
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:04,730
Oh, I probably have to ring it five times, right?

1635
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:06,270
I imagine, to get inside.

1636
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:11,690
Appleclaw.

1637
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,300
It's pretty cute.

1638
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,260
I'm not gonna lie.

1639
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,460
Okay, guys.

1640
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:23,860
Before we go into...

1641
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,700
Well, let's try this area.

1642
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:27,600
If it's spooky scary...

1643
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,720
I'm gonna go save.

1644
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,080
We're gonna go save, and then we'll go into the spooky
scary.

1645
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,740
It's right there!

1646
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:43,980
Okay.

1647
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,280
We're fine!

1648
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,740
I just need to hear the music and that'll be fine.

1649
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,140
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

1650
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,360
Which one should we try?

1651
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:04,700
I'm thinking.

1652
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,000
What was this one?

1653
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,640
This looks like the crypt.

1654
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:16,940
Spooky me to game it, let's go.

1655
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,080
Mara even adds her sass to it when she tosses her.

1656
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:32,080
grenades i know okay that's the crypt this must be the
haunted mansion oh manner sorry i wonder if that's

1657
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:43,160
copyrighted then what's this one the witch and then the
dungeon no this must be the dungeon and then this is the

1658
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:49,780
witch okay this is where we need to go for the trident okay
okay okay Oh, no!

1659
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,780
Here's a witchwood!

1660
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,420
It's a tent made of sticks.

1661
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,100
Entrance is blocked.

1662
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,940
It looks like it's just blocked by sticks.

1663
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,360
I think we can get rid of that.

1664
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:00,580
It's a face.

1665
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,640
He's smiling at me.

1666
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,100
I'll take it.

1667
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:04,920
I couldn't move him.

1668
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:06,740
I think he's fine where he is.

1669
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,200
Oh.

1670
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:11,600
Okay, interesting.

1671
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,700
That's how we open him up.

1672
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,320
Oh.

1673
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,100
I'm just gonna run past you.

1674
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,040
I think there's something...

1675
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,840
Wait, what's this?

1676
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,200
We had a complaint from a parent about the depiction of
alcohol in the mermaid cage.

1677
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,120
Of all the things to complain about!

1678
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,220
I told her it's not an alcohol bottle.

1679
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:49,360
It's a bottle of highly corrosive acid that actually seemed
to placate her.

1680
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:57,010
It doesn't open.

1681
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:00,510
The dog is chasing after me, you guys.

1682
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:04,910
The Deceptive Serpent Imprisoned for Crimes Against Nature.

1683
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:06,730
1800 BCE!

1684
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:10,370
Whoa.

1685
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:15,530
When talking to NPCs, make sure you've seen all their
dialogue before moving on.

1686
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:18,130
If you see a speech bubble, try talking to them again.

1687
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:19,030
Oh, okay, cool.

1688
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:19,590
Let's get to them.

1689
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:26,190
The Deadly Mermaid Imprisoned For Crimes Against Nature.

1690
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:29,450
Okay.

1691
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:32,850
Oh, there's two of them.

1692
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:38,670
The big bad wolf imprisoned for crimes against nature.

1693
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:45,150
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here, but...

1694
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:45,950
An iron maiden?

1695
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:47,250
Wait, I can go in?

1696
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:05,790
I'm somewhere.

1697
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:08,670
What happened to me?

1698
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:10,710
What is this?

1699
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:13,090
I'm in the back rooms for real now.

1700
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,330
The power switch for the...

1701
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:22,300
The power switch for the four periphery elevators is in
Tolman's office.

1702
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:24,840
Yes, that's the other side of the park.

1703
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,700
Yes, that means you're in the wrong place.

1704
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,640
Watch out for glass gas traps laying on the...

1705
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,000
Oh, you can smash them from a safe distance.

1706
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,580
Glass gas trap?

1707
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,940
Oh my god, try saying that five times fast.

1708
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,720
Glass gas trap, glass...

1709
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,840
Magnum ammo!

1710
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:49,860
Glass gas trap, glass gas trap, glass gas trap, glass gas
trap, glass gas trap.

1711
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,600
Glass gas gas gas trap.

1712
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,460
What was this one?

1713
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:08,680
A cyclops.

1714
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,800
I'm trying to see what this thing says on the table, but I'm
afraid of these little...

1715
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,320
boogers.

1716
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,460
These boogers chasing after me.

1717
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,380
Oh, there's three of them.

1718
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,280
Oh my god.

1719
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:24,240
Okay.

1720
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:25,360
What does it say?

1721
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,180
I'll go up to stream.

1722
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,720
Man, I request an...

1723
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,600
Atlanta Hall for the squad.

1724
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,100
You're not actually gonna go, are you?

1725
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,600
I shouldn't ask how far away it is from you.

1726
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,060
I guess people do live in Atlanta, huh?

1727
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:47,020
If it's more than 10 minutes away, don't go.

1728
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:49,860
7.

1729
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:57,140
South American gold mine linked to local landowner reports
have emerged detailing the activities of a recently revived

1730
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:06,960
Brazilian gold mine for the glass glass gas trap apparently
the site near the north coast of the state of state of para

1731
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,760
is currently operating as one of the most profitable gold
mines in the Americas selling to at least two major

1732
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:19,940
international companies but why you ask are we reporting
this in the Atlanta globe the person who writes these so

1733
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:21,060
sassy too.

1734
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,980
They're like, you might be wondering why am I riding this?

1735
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,300
Well, actually.

1736
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:34,120
They're so sassy.

1737
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:42,720
It's recently surfaced at the gold mine in question is
actually owned by local landowner and businessman Edward

1738
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,060
Crow.

1739
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,480
Yeah, he's got an attitude.

1740
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,500
They were like, yeah, he named the park after himself.

1741
01:39:51,080 --> 01:40:00,780
Most readers probably only know him as the eponymous
eponymon?

1742
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:03,500
What's it?

1743
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:04,700
How do you say that?

1744
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,760
Eponymous?

1745
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,680
Hippopotamus?

1746
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,100
E-pony mouse?

1747
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,080
Hippopotamus owner of the Crow Country theme park here in
Atlanta.

1748
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:33,220
And indeed, it seems there has been some effort to cover up
Mr. Crow's connection to this profitable gold mine.

1749
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:38,640
While eyebrows are certainly being raised at this
revelation, at least we finally discovered the source of

1750
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,720
Crow's vast wealth.

1751
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,240
Is this a puzzle here now then?

1752
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,820
Am I supposed to do it in a certain order?

1753
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:49,600
But I do not know the order yet, perhaps.

1754
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:51,720
sheet.

1755
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:54,980
Oh, computer.

1756
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,140
I'm not good at computers.

1757
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:58,000
Try anyway.

1758
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:01,480
Okay, we don't have the slot.

1759
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,380
Uh-huh.

1760
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:09,970
This theme park is very interesting.

1761
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:15,690
It's apparently a 21 hour, 21 hour drive.

1762
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:17,250
I don't pass.

1763
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:19,510
What do I miss the next stream?

1764
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:21,830
What?

1765
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:23,010
You're gonna pass?

1766
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:23,990
Sounds good.

1767
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:34,190
like the time of your life going to a courthouse in the
middle of a city that you have to drive 21 hours for this

1768
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:44,090
thing they say that i can use this as well look at that guy
what is this one if you're doing maintenance on the haunted

1769
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:52,250
oh yeah the crank handle and the safe wait what did it say
the code for the safe is something to do with the grip so

1770
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:52,590
that's right

1771
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,980
Let's try.

1772
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,410
One, two, three, four, five.

1773
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,860
Are you going to keep going?

1774
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:19,000
We're in the haunted manor?

1775
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,640
Dorak.

1776
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:27,780
Oh.

1777
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:30,600
Ghost!

1778
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,840
He's so cute.

1779
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,900
Where's the phone at?

1780
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,600
Oh, is this it?

1781
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:42,380
Hey!

1782
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:44,540
Moshi Moshi.

1783
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:47,600
You came back.

1784
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,480
Who is this?

1785
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,360
I'll admit, I'm glad to see you're up and about.

1786
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:55,160
Oh, the tenacity of a youth.

1787
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,260
He's gone.

1788
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,940
Whoa, it's a window.

1789
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:03,960
It's not real.

1790
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:04,760
It's just a picture.

1791
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,520
It hasn't rained in a while, actually.

1792
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,320
Oh, another ghost.

1793
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:12,900
Melody of the Dead.

1794
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,700
By Allegretto Vivaci.

1795
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:18,900
It's a little creepy.

1796
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,000
Is it?

1797
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,520
It looks like a skull emoji.

1798
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,120
The clock needs regular one.

1799
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:32,460
finding.

1800
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:34,900
But please don't attempt it without the correct tool.

1801
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,720
Do I die if I touch the ghost?

1802
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:41,380
There's a lot of blood underneath him.

1803
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:43,680
It's a coffin.

1804
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,000
There's a vampire sleeping inside.

1805
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,420
Did you know that you're cute today?

1806
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,200
Kaboo!

1807
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:02,640
Thank you!

1808
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,200
Look closer.

1809
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:07,660
Give him a little smooch.

1810
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:08,980
He's not real.

1811
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:09,760
Obviously.

1812
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:11,240
He could be.

1813
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:22,670
Tall wooden crates can be broken.

1814
01:44:27,490 --> 01:44:30,010
Wait, didn't it say not to touch the bookcases?

1815
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:33,890
Can you make a cute sound?

1816
01:44:38,290 --> 01:44:39,230
Large cloak.

1817
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:40,810
What is this?

1818
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:41,850
Old painting.

1819
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:43,690
Song in a cage.

1820
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:50,030
Beowoo!

1821
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:51,610
Painting of a demon.

1822
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,230
An Andromalek.

1823
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:54,990
Andromalek.

1824
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:56,990
Andromalek.

1825
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:58,450
Glitch.

1826
01:44:58,810 --> 01:44:59,510
The undying.

1827
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:01,170
Blamed for many deaths.

1828
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:03,350
Between 1020 and.

1829
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,670
1115.

1830
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:06,570
Zekta.

1831
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:07,330
Welcome to.

1832
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:09,730
Oh, Bishop, thank you.

1833
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:11,510
I refuse to put my hand in there.

1834
01:45:11,610 --> 01:45:12,230
Not happening.

1835
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:13,910
Oh, come on.

1836
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:17,590
I'm so curious about the ghosts.

1837
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:22,210
And then I have to play something here, right?

1838
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,430
My mom used to make me practice every day.

1839
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:25,430
Oh.

1840
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:30,820
Do-do-do.

1841
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:31,520
Beep.

1842
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:31,760
Wait.

1843
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:32,920
Do-do-do-do.

1844
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:33,160
Beep.

1845
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,260
Beep.

1846
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:37,940
Do-do.

1847
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:38,120
Do-do-do.

1848
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:38,760
Beep.

1849
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:38,980
Beep.

1850
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,400
Do-do-do-do.

1851
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:41,620
Beep.

1852
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:42,080
Beep-weep.

1853
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,600
Piano puzzle.

1854
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,640
How.

1855
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,440
Howl.

1856
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:52,760
survival horror of them.

1857
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,640
I'm so curious.

1858
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:54,880
I'm going to touch it.

1859
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:55,060
Oh.

1860
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,180
Nothing happened.

1861
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,440
Fortune telling machine.

1862
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:01,980
Oh wait, we have another...

1863
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:07,420
Harmony will fade by Alcuna Licenza.

1864
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,540
Why is there a phone in here anyway?

1865
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,440
Nah, well, thank you so much!

1866
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:14,020
We're loved.

1867
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,400
Why do you have to take you?

1868
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,180
Ooh, ooh, ooh, thank you.

1869
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,900
Examine the vampire game for fun dialogue?

1870
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:24,500
That's what you get for trying to scare me.

1871
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:29,440
The true evil, the one that you play the keys.

1872
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:30,580
Yeah.

1873
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,040
What if I just stand here?

1874
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:32,660
Will I die?

1875
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,380
Wait, what's this say?

1876
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:36,660
Oh, this is the winding.

1877
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:39,820
I'm afraid of lightning, you guys.

1878
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:40,960
This part's scaring me.

1879
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:41,980
Sorry.

1880
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:43,840
It's scaring me.

1881
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:47,780
I went to a place recently.

1882
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,320
They had, like, a simulated thunderstorm.

1883
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,360
But I was like, no.

1884
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:52,960
I had to go, I had to leave.

1885
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:05,660
I'm guessing the notes pertain to the pictures, but I'm not
quite sure.

1886
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:07,920
Where are the clocks?

1887
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:11,960
But these are all, like, song-related.

1888
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,100
Wait, song in a cage.

1889
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,360
C-A-G-E.

1890
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,480
Wait a second.

1891
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:22,920
Cage.

1892
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,500
D-E-A-D.

1893
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:27,960
Dead.

1894
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,140
Fade.

1895
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:30,460
Wait, okay, hold on.

1896
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,440
C-O-G.

1897
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,480
Oh, I got one.

1898
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:43,260
Okay, wait.

1899
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:50,060
Dead.

1900
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,060
Oh, do I have to do it in order?

1901
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:54,580
Oh!

1902
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,540
Oh, this opens.

1903
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,280
Climb through?

1904
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:25,990
Oh my god, chill out.

1905
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:27,270
Oh, sheesh.

1906
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:28,130
Okay, I'm just gonna run.

1907
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:33,700
I ain't got time to do it.

1908
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:34,660
Oh, what the?

1909
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:35,680
Who just shot?

1910
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:38,580
Wait, what?

1911
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:42,800
Oh, shoot.

1912
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:44,160
No, no, don't come to me.

1913
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:51,460
Hammer sponge.

1914
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:56,840
like there should i should not this is why i don't like
survival horror games because i'm always like freaking out

1915
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:05,000
about ammo there's a button between the pan a panel on the
back of the wooden crow house you can use it to access the

1916
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:15,400
controls for the big animatronic crow okay gosh there's so
many memos to remember tolman's records march 27th 1988

1917
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:21,300
alarm triggered at 2 15 a.m two more guests appeared in the
pool room.

1918
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,980
This time, I made sure the cameras were running, so we have
proof.

1919
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:28,880
They came out of the pool!

1920
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,420
They were worse than the first.

1921
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:32,320
Broken.

1922
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,260
Wrong shape.

1923
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,300
Falling apart.

1924
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:40,140
I feel heartless describing them so, but I have no other
words for them.

1925
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:44,500
Boss said we wouldn't be able to move them, like we did with
the first guest.

1926
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,520
He spent 23 minutes trying to talk to them.

1927
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:49,060
Then he shot them both.

1928
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:54,120
Sorry, I thought I felt like I had...

1929
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:54,720
Oh, my God.

1930
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,020
I thought I had something in my throat.

1931
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,420
Are you alright, ma'am?

1932
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:00,780
My head...

1933
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,580
Oh, she's turning.

1934
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:03,760
I threw up.

1935
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,160
Hey, it's alright.

1936
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,080
Don't worry about it.

1937
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,760
Can I ask, did something happen to you?

1938
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:09,700
It only grazed me.

1939
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:10,820
I thought I'd be fine.

1940
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:13,180
I don't even know what it was.

1941
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:16,160
My head is pounding.

1942
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,620
My stomach is...

1943
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:18,280
Alright.

1944
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:19,620
You were attacked.

1945
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:20,760
I feel...

1946
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:21,420
Uh-oh.

1947
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:23,460
She threw up.

1948
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:24,300
I feel dizzy.

1949
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,160
I have something that might make you feel better.

1950
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,100
At least for a while.

1951
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:29,640
Maybe antidote?

1952
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:31,360
You should take this.

1953
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:35,880
Her tummy is going crazy.

1954
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:37,680
Thanks.

1955
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:39,980
I think that actually helped.

1956
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:41,640
Oh, I'm so rude.

1957
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,360
What's your name?

1958
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:45,180
Give her a bullet.

1959
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,820
Here, ma'am.

1960
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,280
I think this is.

1961
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:51,300
This might help.

1962
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,620
She's all she needs is some pep de obismo.

1963
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,500
I'm Mara.

1964
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,120

Agent Forest.

1966
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,120
Don't get it wrong.

1967
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:02,500
Don't get it twisted.

1968
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,060
Don't you forget it.

1969
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:05,800
Thanks, Mara.

1970
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,680

01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:56,750
He's not in there.

1980
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:59,950
I've been out here for hours and I haven't heard a sound.

1981
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:04,290
Oh, she obviously has not heard the zombie walking across
the hall.

1982
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:08,790
Be that as it may, I'd still like to take a look inside.

1983
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:11,650
Do you know how to get in?

1984
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:12,890
Crow facts!

1985
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:17,150
Crows remember human faces and sometimes leave you gifts
junk mostly when you feed it.

1986
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:19,370
Yes, I did know that one.

1987
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:21,970
I want to tame a crow.

1988
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:29,290
So if I give Doki Bird some junk, she'll bring me stuff too?

1989
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:33,130
How do I get in?

1990
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:34,090
That's going to be difficult.

1991
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:35,490
You'll need the key.

1992
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:37,050
It's a big fancy gold one.

1993
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:38,050
Gold key.

1994
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:38,810
Got it.

1995
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:41,310
And you'll have to turn off the electrified door handle.

1996
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:43,170
How do I do that?

1997
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,010
No idea.

1998
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:48,290
It wasn't electrified the last time I was here.

1999
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:51,650
Father must have only recently had it installed.

2000
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:55,250
Does she remember your face?

2001
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:57,550
I hope so.

2002
01:52:58,750 --> 01:52:58,930
Why?

2003
01:52:59,050 --> 01:53:00,210
What's he hiding in there?

2004
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:03,630
Interesting.

2005
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:06,850
Large med kit.

2006
01:53:07,110 --> 01:53:07,430
Let's go!

2007
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:09,690
And what is this?

2008
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:15,410
Chrome moved the electric battery charger to the southeast
underground level.

2009
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:17,970
I know that means you won't have access to it anymore.

2010
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:19,590
I think that was the idea.

2011
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:31,130
hear like the buzzing of the thing is like me like this
you're supposed to be able to do this with the bad with the

2012
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:52,470
bad guys right locker the door stuff oh boy it's nice what
about the there was another locker I saw um Some mobs and

2013
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:52,770
stuff.

2014
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:53,870
What's over here?

2015
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:55,530
Oh!

2016
01:53:58,030 --> 01:54:00,870
I think this is where we came in earlier, no?

2017
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:05,130
Yes!

2018
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:06,990
Okay, cool.

2019
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:08,750
I see him twitching up there.

2020
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:09,410
You see that guy?

2021
01:54:10,830 --> 01:54:11,770
He's spawning.

2022
01:54:11,950 --> 01:54:13,210
He's camping the...

2023
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:13,730
What's it called?

2024
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:15,050
The locker.

2025
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:16,970
Oh my god.

2026
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:17,590
Oh my god.

2027
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,030
Please.

2028
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:18,830
I'm stuck.

2029
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:20,150
I'm stuck.

2030
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:21,630
I want to get this locker too.

2031
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:28,690
We'll just do that.

2032
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:31,490
Kick it!

2033
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:32,830
Kick it!

2034
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:33,990
Oh, wait, no!

2035
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:37,590
I can't tell what's in these ones.

2036
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:39,690
They're like bottles or something, but...

2037
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:44,970
D-Pike, park operations.

2038
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,340
That don't seem very good.

2039
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:56,380
Um, Mr. Pike, are you okay?

2040
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:01,540
Oh, shit, he's dead.

2041
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:02,200
Whoa!

2042
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:03,840
Rufus!

2043
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:07,180
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gift, and thank
you!

2044
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:10,960
I guess he shot himself.

2045
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,480
Should I call the police?

2046
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:15,020
There's a handgun laying next to him.

2047
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:16,740
I better not touch it.

2048
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,140
Or I could take that.

2049
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,640
Maybe she just has to kick it real good.

2050
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:24,700
Kick it good.

2051
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,520
Who is- is that your wife?

2052
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:29,800
No.

2053
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:31,760
No.

2054
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,060
Is this an alt?

2055
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:34,080
Staff memo.

2056
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,500
The following doors are now locked electronically.

2057
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,100
Dungeon, Mermaid, Cyclops...

2058
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:39,220
Oh!

2059
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:42,160
Mermaid, Cyclops, Wolf Serpent.

2060
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:43,940
Cryptophilia.

2061
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,200
They can only be opened via the dungeon's computer terminal.

2062
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:49,960
Oh, so maybe I can't.

2063
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:56,060
She's single, yeah, I think so.

2064
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:06,380
So it's not like a matter of me opening in this order, I
think.

2065
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:09,520
But I'm going to take a picture of it anyway.

2066
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:22,680
Sorry, I hit my mic with my, with my, uh, my phone.

2067
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:30,850
Filing cabinet, well-organized.

2068
01:56:33,010 --> 01:56:35,830
funding for Cosmic Future, and we've halted construction.

2069
01:56:36,350 --> 01:56:37,810
He said it was just a temporary delay.

2070
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:40,210
But I could tell when he's lying.

2071
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:45,070
Something is seriously wrong with Edward.

2072
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:46,050
He looks sick.

2073
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:49,090
But at the same time, there's kind of a manic energy in his
eyes.

2074
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:52,010
I asked Tolman about it, but he gave me the silent
treatment.

2075
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:54,810
So whatever it is, I think they're in on it together.

2076
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:57,990
I tried to spy on Edward and Tolman during their meeting.

2077
01:56:58,490 --> 01:57:02,290
It sounded like they were trying to talk to someone, a third
person in the room who wasn't talking back.

2078
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:10,350
They were talking, like how you talk to a baby or a young
child, speaking slowly, using simple language.

2079
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,210
What is going on?

2080
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:16,110
There's a videotape.

2081
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,240
This is a message for Edward Crowe from Douglas Pike.

2082
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,220
Edward, we've been friends for over 30 years.

2083
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:34,800
You entrusted me with the running of your theme park, a task
I have relished.

2084
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:36,760
Hmm, relish.

2085
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:43,360
You have always shown me kindness and always paid me well
for my work.

2086
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:46,680
However, I can no longer remain silent.

2087
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:50,560
Edward Crowe, your crimes have not gone unnoticed.

2088
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,700
Peckled it.

2089
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,700
Nor will your sins go unpunished.

2090
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:02,080
As for Elaine Marshall, I hope she never forgives us.

2091
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,480
For none of us deserve it.

2092
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:05,520
Goodbye.

2093
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:10,240
That's the end.

2094
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,150
Kind of feel bad for him.

2095
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:19,820
What's this over here?

2096
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,060
Staff memo.

2097
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,100
Damn, he's got...

2098
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:28,080
How many pictures of his wife in a bikini?

2099
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:32,000
Does he need...

2100
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,980
Really getting that...

2101
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:36,160
Those brain juices flowing, huh?

2102
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:38,160
It's just sick.

2103
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:43,040
Oh my god.

2104
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,740
It's a wonder he died.

2105
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:56,300
It's a wonder that he shot himself because he's just like,
Oh, my wife, my wife.

2106
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:57,880
Maybe she's dead too though.

2107
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,220
That would be pretty bad.

2108
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:04,340
Edward had his office door electrified.

2109
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:06,060
Decently high voltage too.

2110
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:09,460
I turned off all the main power, but the door was still
electrified.

2111
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:19,960
to a generator somewhere in the underground level is it
different from you and your oci come on i want you guys to

2112
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:27,220

2113
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:34,080

so are you saying you don't have a lot of similar pictures

2114
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:34,980
of your wives

2115
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:45,920
yeah just have lots of framed photos of me in a bikini It's
a model of the Crow Country Park.

2116
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:46,840
Oh, wait.

2117
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:47,980
Hold on.

2118
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:48,820
Let me read that again.

2119
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:53,100
It looks like there are four main areas and a few smaller
sections around the outside.

2120
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:58,060
I'll take that.

2121
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:00,120
Oh, my God.

2122
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:01,200
There's four.

2123
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,000
Oh, I was wondering what that is.

2124
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:07,740
That's the blood.

2125
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:08,660
Oh, my God.

2126
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,420
Down payment for Minto bikini calendar.

2127
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:13,980
I've only...

2128
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:14,960
Yeah, no one sooner.

2129
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:17,060
I would have made one for 2026.

2130
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:18,380
We have her blessing.

2131
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:19,620
Room review stream with...

2132
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:22,240
I was thinking of doing another one recently, actually.

2133
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:26,860
Maybe we can do one next week.

2134
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:29,500
I'll put it in my calendar.

2135
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,540
No one check it out.

2136
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:39,900
You guys should have all clean rooms for the new year,
right?

2137
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,360
So I feel like it would be good to do one next week.

2138
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:44,960
Maybe.

2139
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:52,170
Uh, wait.

2140
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:53,990
Wait.

2141
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:55,190
It.

2142
02:00:56,630 --> 02:00:57,050
Oh,

2143
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:03,900
here we go.

2144
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:04,600
Not all day.

2145
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,580
There we go.

2146
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:07,500
Okay, save.

2147
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:08,460
Okay.

2148
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:10,540
Yeah, about that.

2149
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:11,720
You still have time!

2150
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,320
Alright.

2151
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:15,960
So we went in this room.

2152
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:19,000
Do you think this thing is still...

2153
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:21,740
actively patrolling?

2154
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,680
I think so.

2155
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,320
Okay, well we have that shortcut.

2156
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:31,400
That led to...

2157
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:34,060
Oh, this was the crypt room.

2158
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:34,700
Yes, yes, yes.

2159
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,140
Oh, what about this one?

2160
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:37,620
Kick it!

2161
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,560
Nothing.

2162
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,260
Dang.

2163
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:41,620
I read this.

2164
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:45,060
Panel of the wooden crowhouse.

2165
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:47,280
I don't even know where a crowhouse is.

2166
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:50,820
My contributions were the mid-vikini calendar.

2167
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:52,140
Hahaha.

2168
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:54,780
Crow house.

2169
02:02:00,090 --> 02:02:01,410
What do the circles mean?

2170
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:04,550
Does that mean that there's a puzzle that I have to solve?

2171
02:02:05,370 --> 02:02:07,430
I don't quite... Oh, wait.

2172
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:07,870
What's this?

2173
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:08,730
Is this a map?

2174
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:11,510
Eastern utility quarters.

2175
02:02:12,270 --> 02:02:13,150
I'll take that.

2176
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:14,610
Yes, indeed.

2177
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,500
What is this?

2178
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:22,400
Fatal error.

2179
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:23,760
Elevator?

2180
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,700
Oh, I don't want to do that.

2181
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:27,360
Nothing happened.

2182
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:28,100
Must be broken.

2183
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:28,600
Okay, good.

2184
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:30,380
She's gone.

2185
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:33,120
And her throw-up is still here.

2186
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:33,960
Nasty.

2187
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:37,900
Um.

2188
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:39,540
Did I open this one too?

2189
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:50,140
Let's try it.

2190
02:02:54,670 --> 02:02:55,750
The fairy.

2191
02:02:58,430 --> 02:02:59,590
It's the fairy.

2192
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:01,550
She's facing the other way.

2193
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:04,370
Interesting.

2194
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:06,130
Uh.

2195
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:08,510
There's so many memos!

2196
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:14,490
Can someone from maintenance please varnish the ocean
kingdom storage room door or else just replace the door

2197
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:15,010
entirely?

2198
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:17,730
It's made from really old wood and it's starting to crumble.

2199
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:19,390
It's not exactly fire safe.

2200
02:03:23,150 --> 02:03:24,030
Oh, gridded!

2201
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:28,030
Yeah, she didn't even clean up after herself.

2202
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:28,890
You know what, though?

2203
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:30,670
I think there's blood everywhere.

2204
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:31,670
I don't think you need to.

2205
02:03:33,010 --> 02:03:34,750
This looks like a little stage.

2206
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:37,630
There's a button.

2207
02:03:38,730 --> 02:03:39,690
Not working?

2208
02:03:39,810 --> 02:03:41,970
I think the curtain has to be fully raised first.

2209
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:43,650
Oh, I see.

2210
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:45,530
And then there's this part.

2211
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:46,110
Pully.

2212
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:47,850
Oh, okay, wait.

2213
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:53,550
I think I want to go save real quick before we...

2214
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:57,150
Because I've done quite a bit and explored quite a bit.

2215
02:03:58,110 --> 02:03:59,630
So I want to...

2216
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:04,910
Run past our friend here.

2217
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:15,060
Savings for quitters?

2218
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:15,740
I don't care.

2219
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:17,280
I'm a quitter then.

2220
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,920
We've done so much, I don't want to do it all again.

2221
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:26,840
I mean, it's really just a lot of reading, but you know what
I mean.

2222
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,640
Oh my god!

2223
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:33,500
Officer!

2224
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:34,600
Excuse me, Miss.

2225
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:36,340
You really shouldn't be wandering around here.

2226
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:37,760
Why not?

2227
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:39,140
It's not safe.

2228
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:39,640
Would you like to?

2229
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:40,760
me to escort you out?

2230
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:42,800
Are you a police officer?

2231
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,920
Police detective Harrison James.

2232
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:52,540
I was supposed to be here hours ago, but some kind of some
kid broke into my car this morning.

2233
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,080
Little punk slashed my tires, too.

2234
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:04,360
It is Leonia.

2235
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:08,800
They look okay to me.

2236
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:11,620
No, they slashed my car tires.

2237
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:16,320
I had to borrow the bike because I couldn't use my car.

2238
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:17,240
Oh, right.

2239
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:17,600
Duh.

2240
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:21,240
I didn't catch your name.

2241
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,040
Oh, right.

2242
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:22,280
Sorry.

2243
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:22,960
I'm Mara.

2244
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:23,940
Aha.

2245
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:26,000
So that's your car out front?

2246
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,160
The 85 Fiesta?

2247
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:28,660
Yeah.

2248
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:29,520
How did you know?

2249
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,140
Wait, how old were...

2250
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:33,260
We're old enough to drive, I suppose.

2251
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:35,320
I met your boyfriend.

2252
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:37,760
He said he was waiting for you.

2253
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:39,220
Oh, my God.

2254
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:40,280
He's not my...

2255
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:41,240
Never mind.

2256
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:41,600
It doesn't matter.

2257
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:42,060
matter.

2258
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:44,940
You're blushing.

2259
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:46,380
I just met this man!

2260
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:48,340
No, I'm not.

2261
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:49,100
Shut up.

2262
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:51,380
Actually, Mara, maybe you can help me.

2263
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:53,480
Wait, what if we didn't kill the creature out here?

2264
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:55,280
Would we never see him?

2265
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:58,180
Would he have killed the creature for us?

2266
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:01,540
Did I do work for nothing?

2267
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:07,340
Mara, maybe you can help me.

2268
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:09,220
I was supposed to meet up with a woman.

2269
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:10,560
A Miss Natalie Crow.

2270
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:12,620
You haven't seen her around, have you?

2271
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:16,760
Uh, as far as I know, she's early 20s, blonde hair.

2272
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:23,240
I don't see why we wouldn't want to tell him.

2273
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:26,700
Maybe he is the creature.

2274
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:27,640
I think so.

2275
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:33,060
I don't see why we wouldn't want to tell him.

2276
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:41,690
Is it a snitch?

2277
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:42,430
I don't know.

2278
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:45,290
Can we trust him?

2279
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:48,310
I think this music makes me feel like I can trust him.

2280
02:06:48,670 --> 02:06:50,210
This is like hymnbo music and all.

2281
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:59,650
So one of my favorite games in last year, I'm happy to see
you playing Happy New Year, and I'm looking forward to

2282
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:00,630
another year of fun streams.

2283
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,630
Suki!

2284
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:02,710
Thank you!

2285
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:04,430
Thank you, thank you!

2286
02:07:04,510 --> 02:07:05,950
Thank you so much for this over time!

2287
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:12,390
You did tell her that you're a replacement for him.

2288
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:12,750
That's true.

2289
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:13,950
Well, we won't tell him then, you're right.

2290
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:18,110
I thought I'd ask just in case.

2291
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:22,730
I need to go find Miss Crowe, but I'm going to ask you to go
back to your car, okay?

2292
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:24,090
It's not safe here.

2293
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:25,130
You need to go home.

2294
02:07:25,330 --> 02:07:26,070
I agree.

2295
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:28,810
Sure, I was just on my way out, more or less.

2296
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:30,030
Glad to hear it.

2297
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:31,210
You'll be safe now, okay?

2298
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,280
I really didn't think he was going to show up.

2299
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,010
Oh my, wait.

2300
02:07:44,670 --> 02:07:45,310
Phone is ringing.

2301
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:49,210
Moshi Moshi.

2302
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:51,110
Listen.

2303
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:51,610
Listen.

2304
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:54,370
I had no idea what the roots were for.

2305
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:56,190
How could I have known?

2306
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:57,690
What roots?

2307
02:07:57,770 --> 02:07:58,610
What are you talking about?

2308
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:00,690
There are seven in total.

2309
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:02,430
And I cut them down.

2310
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:03,170
Cut them open.

2311
02:08:03,990 --> 02:08:05,430
You cut them open?

2312
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:05,750
What?

2313
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:09,870
All but one.

2314
02:08:10,150 --> 02:08:11,130
We left one intact.

2315
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:12,670
For prosperity, we thought.

2316
02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:14,570
What a farce.

2317
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:17,330
He's gone.

2318
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:23,590
Well, I guess it was a good thing we did come out here.

2319
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:30,830
I just realized, or rather I remembered, that we can get
more ammo from our car anytime.

2320
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:33,610
So if I do run out, we can just go grab some more.

2321
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:35,410
Which, how much am I at right now?

2322
02:08:35,850 --> 02:08:36,210
15?

2323
02:08:37,970 --> 02:08:38,690
Not bad.

2324
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:40,830
I think we're okay for right now.

2325
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:46,100
These birds are persistent.

2326
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,840
Just trying to eat whatever the heck this is.

2327
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:55,020
I wonder how this guy is doing out here, though.

2328
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:01,860
Wait, how do I...

2329
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,400
Where did I come in from?

2330
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,100
Oh, over here.

2331
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:09,840
I didn't recognize it because I didn't know that I could
turn the camera at the time.

2332
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:13,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2333
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:14,780
Wait, what's this?

2334
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:16,300
Board of ticket prices.

2335
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,860
This place used to be fairly popular with locals.

2336
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:24,080
Crow...

2337
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:24,680
Country.

2338
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:26,100
Can I open this?

2339
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:29,160
Oh, I already searched it, just kidding.

2340
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,940
Let's go see how our buddy's doing.

2341
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:32,620
Our boyfriend.

2342
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:34,180
Alleged boyfriend.

2343
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:35,120
Oh, he's so polite.

2344
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:35,780
Hello.

2345
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:36,980
How are you doing?

2346
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:38,120
I'm okay.

2347
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:40,060
Checking in on a friend.

2348
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:42,100
Talk to Arthur when he's waiting in the car.

2349
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:44,180
You get an achievement for it.

2350
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:46,580
You can be honest.

2351
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:48,080
Your leg hurts pretty bad, right?

2352
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,060
Yeah, it's throbbing.

2353
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:51,000
It feels weird.

2354
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:53,460
And you have a headache and some kind of...

2355
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,340
And feel kind of queasy?

2356
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:55,720
How did you know?

2357
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:57,360
I think that hurt you.

2358
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:58,120
It hurt me too.

2359
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:11,320
but still do i need to go to the hospital i yes i think you
should go anyway mara just sit tight all right you'll be

2360
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:12,040
safe in the car

2361
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:21,670
i think um what the heck is that sound

2362
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:28,760
you hear that's creepy i think uh oh

2363
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:40,900
the security camera is moving Someone is monitoring us.

2364
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:51,470
It's quick too.

2365
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:52,670
Yeah, it's quick.

2366
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:57,200
Crazy.

2367
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:02,420
Okay.

2368
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:05,760
So it was kind of cool.

2369
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,380
So something about the crow...

2370
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:08,840
There was like a panel, etc.

2371
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:10,220
Or maybe here.

2372
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:12,640
To operate the crow.

2373
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:17,900
Press it.

2374
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:18,420
Whoa.

2375
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:21,520
Control panel.

2376
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:23,660
Crow walking sequence.

2377
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,140
Let's see the other side.

2378
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:29,640
Crow turntable control.

2379
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:30,480
Okay, so DJ.

2380
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:36,460
Oh, we can control which way he walks.

2381
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:44,700
Go!

2382
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:45,480
Nothing happened.

2383
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,400
I think it's out of power.

2384
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:47,900
Dang.

2385
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:49,600
Wait, but he can turn.

2386
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:52,460
Hmm.

2387
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:52,860
Okay.

2388
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:00,760
Is this person still over here?

2389
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,200
Absolutely.

2390
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:05,940
How are there just people walking around?

2391
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:07,100
But there's also monsters.

2392
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:09,240
Um.

2393
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:12,540
But now that I remember that I can get stuff out of my bag.

2394
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:14,840
Or my trunk, I mean.

2395
02:12:19,950 --> 02:12:20,830
Shotgun shells.

2396
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:22,590
And.

2397
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:24,810
Nice.

2398
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:34,090
Where were we?

2399
02:12:34,770 --> 02:12:36,330
We were in here.

2400
02:12:39,370 --> 02:12:41,270
And we went through here.

2401
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:43,990
Which I'm guessing.

2402
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:46,110
This also opened up.

2403
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:47,070
Which one was this?

2404
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:48,110
Cage.

2405
02:12:49,690 --> 02:12:51,150
So let's try cage.

2406
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:54,130
See?

2407
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:58,500
Hmm.

2408
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:00,520
They look like monsters to you.

2409
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:01,860
What do you mean?

2410
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:06,140
Oh, there's a mushroom.

2411
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:08,320
I'm a little mushroom boy.

2412
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:11,120
I'll use my mushroom magic to grant you a wish.

2413
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:13,160
Tell me, what is it that you wish?

2414
02:13:14,780 --> 02:13:15,160
Uh...

2415
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:15,700
What's that?

2416
02:13:15,780 --> 02:13:18,020
You want to improve the range of your flamethrower?

2417
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:19,780
To each their own.

2418
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:21,100
Wait, I don't have a flamethrower.

2419
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,000
Wait, get the wish.

2420
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,680
Wait, if I don't have...

2421
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:24,820
Wait.

2422
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,460
I don't have a flamethrower.

2423
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:38,130
If I get one, will it still be?

2424
02:13:46,910 --> 02:13:48,870
Wait, you don't even have a flamethrower.

2425
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:50,250
No wish for you.

2426
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:51,650
Rude?

2427
02:13:53,110 --> 02:13:55,030
Okay, there was one other thing.

2428
02:13:55,150 --> 02:13:56,170
It was this one.

2429
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:57,650
Fade.

2430
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:07,680
Nice.

2431
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:10,960
Oh, okay.

2432
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:13,360
Okie dokie.

2433
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:24,260
Well, um, only the one had the room so I guess we've
completed everything else besides this the mouth has a hole

2434
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:31,300
but we won't put our hand in it crow fact a crow will
attempt to clean a trusted person's eyelashes with their

2435
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:35,000
beak and get deeply insulted if they get rejected

2436
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:44,300

2437
02:14:52,770 --> 02:15:02,190

2440
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:34,790
your immediate attention you should know that Elaine
Marshall's family have appointed a lawyer.

2441
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:36,590
Saul!

2442
02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:38,290
They called Saul!

2443
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:41,890
The case against you is being prepared as I write this
letter.

2444
02:15:44,530 --> 02:15:45,010
Rout roll.

2445
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:50,650
Wait, there was the bike, but there is no police officer.

2446
02:15:52,030 --> 02:15:52,990
Where did this go again?

2447
02:15:53,530 --> 02:15:54,610
Oh, to the...

2448
02:15:54,610 --> 02:15:58,270
We could try this because I saved, so...

2449
02:15:58,270 --> 02:15:59,030
Let's open.

2450
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:01,610
Pull it?

2451
02:16:03,110 --> 02:16:04,210
Pull it again?

2452
02:16:05,010 --> 02:16:06,490
Okay, Mara, come on.

2453
02:16:08,650 --> 02:16:11,310
Mara, don't be like that girl.

2454
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:28,720
Is it just him?

2455
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:33,520
There's an alien baby in the audience tonight.

2456
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:37,640
I thought he was looking at me.

2457
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:39,220
I think he's infatuated with her.

2458
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:45,440
Mara, you're a...

2459
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:45,780
girl.

2460
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:47,900
I think you need to use both hands.

2461
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:51,340
Ma'am?

2462
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:01,420
Oh!

2463
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:05,440
Wait, I don't like that.

2464
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:08,660
I thought I was gonna start the show.

2465
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:12,060
That was one of my bullets.

2466
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,600
Okay, reload.

2467
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:18,160
She's facing the other way.

2468
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:20,680
She looks so beautiful!

2469
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:24,940
Okay, I think I gotta go down.

2470
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:28,520
Oh my god, it's scaring me that thing.

2471
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:31,880
I don't think I see anything else out there, though.

2472
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:32,860
Just him.

2473
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:35,080
Hopefully not.

2474
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:37,960
I see some ammo, though.

2475
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:39,960
Green woman.

2476
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,280
Itachi!

2477
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:43,500
Thank you!

2478
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:47,140
Thank you so much.

2479
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,640
I don't think he's a baddie.

2480
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,740
I think I see the baddie down there.

2481
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:00,120
Oh my god, and a phone ringing.

2482
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:07,480
Shoot.

2483
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:08,320
Now.

2484
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,020
Ah!

2485
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:11,440
Ah!

2486
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:13,620
Oh my god.

2487
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:15,760
Okay, there is more than one for sure.

2488
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:16,740
I see the other one.

2489
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:18,700
Uh, where's the phone?

2490
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:21,940
Let's just walk over that guy.

2491
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:22,800
Hello?

2492
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:25,600
Moshe, moshe.

2493
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:29,720
The first guest emerged from the pool two years ago.

2494
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:41,400
ago i've been thinking it must have been on purpose the
timing i mean two years ago 1988 it must have been some sort

2495
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:50,660
of intersection a critical pivoting point if you will late
enough that we've developed the necessary infrastructure

2496
02:18:50,660 --> 02:18:57,680
early enough that we've well early enough so as to not be
too late This guy is talking in riddles.

2497
02:18:58,780 --> 02:18:59,960
Quit being so weird.

2498
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:06,560
I'm going to kill these guys because they run at you and
they scare me.

2499
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:11,660
Oh, shoot.

2500
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:14,760
Oh, he doesn't run.

2501
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:18,000
I think I got him, though.

2502
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:20,380
The other guy ran at me.

2503
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:22,480
Funky.

2504
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:24,800
Funky little critters.

2505
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:28,140
20 months.

2506
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:30,380
Thank you, gentlebred man!

2507
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:31,960
Thank you!

2508
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:37,740
I noticed the seven seas mermaids use the same kind of
battery as the giant crow.

2509
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:38,760
Not a great idea.

2510
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,300
Those kinds of batteries aren't waterproof.

2511
02:19:40,860 --> 02:19:43,500
Those mermaids are going to need constant maintenance.

2512
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:46,560
Walking stick.

2513
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:49,960
No, like take...

2514
02:19:51,700 --> 02:19:52,220
Take...

2515
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:54,600
Nobody needed to use that stick.

2516
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:56,840
Why didn't you just take it out?

2517
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:58,620
Hello?

2518
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:01,960
Wait, so is this guy alive, or?

2519
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,560
I don't think so.

2520
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:06,110
Okay, there's some bullets here.

2521
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,040
What is this?

2522
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:13,600
Yeah.

2523
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:16,860
Alright, what we got going on around here?

2524
02:20:19,060 --> 02:20:20,040
Trash can?

2525
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:22,780
Apple.

2526
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:24,440
A lot of apples here.

2527
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,680
Very health-conscious people, huh?

2528
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:28,780
It's the fairy.

2529
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:31,840
Hello, thank you for helping me before.

2530
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:35,260
I'd never have found that bronze key without you.

2531
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:37,520
She's so cute.

2532
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:40,200
Mara's kind of cute.

2533
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:45,160
I thought I saw other ammo, but I was wrong.

2534
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:48,960
Antidove.

2535
02:20:53,230 --> 02:20:55,090
This game does have a cool vibe, right?

2536
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:56,950
I still don't know what this is.

2537
02:20:57,070 --> 02:20:57,450
You know what?

2538
02:20:58,230 --> 02:20:58,850
Let's check it out.

2539
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:02,730
Tank of gasoline.

2540
02:21:04,810 --> 02:21:09,630
Oh, I wonder if I can, like, set this down and then have,
like, a portable explosion.

2541
02:21:11,430 --> 02:21:12,090
Very cool.

2542
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:13,450
Did somebody kill it?

2543
02:21:13,730 --> 02:21:14,710
Or did it just die?

2544
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:18,050
Me?

2545
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:20,270
Wait, I...

2546
02:21:20,830 --> 02:21:22,290
Was that not my...

2547
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:25,250
Wait, where'd this guy go?

2548
02:21:25,690 --> 02:21:27,170
Wait, did I...

2549
02:21:27,170 --> 02:21:27,410
Wait.

2550
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:30,790
Oh god.

2551
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:32,150
It's... I don't...

2552
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:32,970
Well, it's dead.

2553
02:21:33,450 --> 02:21:34,810
I suppose that's all there is to say.

2554
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,890
A valve.

2555
02:21:38,930 --> 02:21:39,670
Turn it?

2556
02:21:43,710 --> 02:21:44,870
Oh my god, cute!

2557
02:21:45,010 --> 02:21:45,930
She kicks her legs!

2558
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:52,970
The more new rooms you explore, the more phone calls you
get.

2559
02:21:53,430 --> 02:21:55,510
The more dangerous the old rooms become.

2560
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:56,130
Good luck.

2561
02:21:57,570 --> 02:21:57,950
Oh.

2562
02:21:59,470 --> 02:21:59,990
Freaky.

2563
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:03,070
I don't know how I feel about that.

2564
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:05,210
The kikis are so cute!

2565
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:11,130
Where are we anyway?

2566
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:14,370
I'm trying to think of what we need to do.

2567
02:22:15,010 --> 02:22:17,070
I guess we can go back to the crypt.

2568
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:19,170
Oh, we went through the haunted manor, that's right.

2569
02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:20,230
So let's go!

2570
02:22:23,230 --> 02:22:25,170
Let's see where this leads to, first of all.

2571
02:22:25,530 --> 02:22:26,550
I think this is the theater.

2572
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:36,900
Yes.

2573
02:22:39,380 --> 02:22:44,580
Let me know if you guys want me to like move anywhere
because I'm blocking too much.

2574
02:22:45,860 --> 02:22:53,020
I can like kind of actually I might like just do like a
little like that just a little bit more.

2575
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:53,320
Hmm.

2576
02:22:57,450 --> 02:22:59,030
Minky should be bigger.

2577
02:23:01,550 --> 02:23:02,690
Move closer?

2578
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:14,840
Sounds like a cat purring.

2579
02:23:24,530 --> 02:23:25,350
There we go.

2580
02:23:26,970 --> 02:23:29,370
Could you please move into our homes?

2581
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:31,130
I mean, I could haunt your home.

2582
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:34,490
It ain't not...

2583
02:23:34,490 --> 02:23:34,890
Mlem!

2584
02:23:36,310 --> 02:23:37,410
You want a mlem?

2585
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:39,190
Thank you so much for the...

2586
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:40,190
How can I...

2587
02:23:40,190 --> 02:23:43,110
How can I deny the people what they want?

2588
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:44,730
If you want a mlem...

2589
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:47,150
If you want a mlem...

2590
02:23:47,150 --> 02:23:47,730
I can...

2591
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:01,240
Okay.

2592
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:02,140
Back to game.

2593
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:05,660
Back to regular...

2594
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:07,060
schedule the programming.

2595
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:11,900
I think I'll have to go get some...

2596
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:13,000
What's it called soon though?

2597
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:14,840
Okay, let's go back to the crypt.

2598
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:18,160
I will need to go get some water, I mean, is what I was
trying to say.

2599
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:26,460
I don't like that I have to press to go down the stairs.

2600
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:28,120
That part annoys me.

2601
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:29,620
Just a tiny bit.

2602
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:32,120
What's my gun looking at?

2603
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:40,320
This door.

2604
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:41,900
Oh,

2605
02:24:49,610 --> 02:24:50,230
he just smaller.

2606
02:24:59,550 --> 02:25:00,330
Moki-doki.

2607
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:02,430
Let's leave here.

2608
02:25:05,890 --> 02:25:07,890
And we have his bike.

2609
02:25:08,770 --> 02:25:10,430
We do not have the police officer.

2610
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:12,490
Maybe he's in the crypt.

2611
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:19,240
Ooh!

2612
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:32,400
Something's aiming at.

2613
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:33,640
aiming at me.

2614
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:43,760
What is that?

2615
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:45,720
Is that a person?

2616
02:25:58,220 --> 02:25:59,340
Is it gonna shoot?

2617
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:01,380
I better not touch it.

2618
02:26:02,340 --> 02:26:02,980
The clock.

2619
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:05,440
Um.

2620
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:08,380
Ah.

2621
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,380
Hakiba Olaf.

2622
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:11,360
Gravestone.

2623
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:12,580
Solina.

2624
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:14,020
1805.

2625
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:15,340
1872.

2626
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,400
Estelle.

2627
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,900
1898, 1938.

2628
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:22,820
Oh, whoops.

2629
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:24,340
I didn't mean to do that.

2630
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,280
Solomon Weaselby.

2631
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:34,340
1855, 1909.

2632
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:38,060
Norbert Easley.

2633
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:42,460
Okay, it's a drain.

2634
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:43,720
Not working.

2635
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:46,100
The whole place will probably be flooded soon.

2636
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:47,700
Okay.

2637
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:51,540
the notes said about this room.

2638
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:54,820
Here lies Ophelia, tragically drowned.

2639
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:57,160
Sister, daughter, sister, human.

2640
02:26:57,960 --> 02:26:59,720
Most efficient alarm clock.

2641
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:05,050
Uh...

2642
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:06,430
Small tank of gasoline?

2643
02:27:06,650 --> 02:27:07,410
I'll take it.

2644
02:27:10,670 --> 02:27:13,270
It's pointing the shotgun at me!

2645
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:17,830
Is there anything else?

2646
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:20,030
What's that?

2647
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:22,030
Medkit, I'll take it.

2648
02:27:22,910 --> 02:27:24,110
Oh wait, what's this over here?

2649
02:27:25,310 --> 02:27:28,550
If any of the kids have trouble disabling the trap, you can
offer the advice.

2650
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:30,790
When reading the gravestones, focus on the NAMS.

2651
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:35,330
The birth dates and death dates aren't any use to you for
now.

2652
02:27:36,750 --> 02:27:37,510
Look at the center.

2653
02:27:38,070 --> 02:27:40,430
Look at the floor in the center of the room.

2654
02:27:44,940 --> 02:27:46,400
I wish we could just take the shotgun.

2655
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:50,500
Is this supposed to be West?

2656
02:27:56,870 --> 02:27:58,390
Because he's Wish-O-B?

2657
02:27:58,910 --> 02:27:59,990
Or is it south?

2658
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:01,490
Maybe.

2659
02:28:02,050 --> 02:28:02,510
Southwest?

2660
02:28:04,770 --> 02:28:05,770
Which one would be southwest?

2661
02:28:11,820 --> 02:28:12,440
That way.

2662
02:28:13,340 --> 02:28:13,980
You are.

2663
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:16,620
I can't read it from the back.

2664
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:17,860
Okay.

2665
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:18,520
Okay.

2666
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:20,000
Mara, come on.

2667
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:21,060
You're east.

2668
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:22,300
Actually, that's perfect.

2669
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:23,660
I'm gaming.

2670
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:25,600
South.

2671
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:29,480
Okay.

2672
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,320
Northeast.

2673
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:32,920
Oh,

2674
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:42,780
I stopped it.

2675
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,860
I don't think it's going to shoot me.

2676
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:48,140
Maybe I could just...

2677
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:49,280
Maybe I could use it.

2678
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:50,100
Yoink.

2679
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:50,820
It's stuck.

2680
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:52,260
It's stuck.

2681
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:54,080
I'm going to rip off this guy's arm.

2682
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:56,700
It broke!

2683
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:00,040
I guess it was just a plastic decoration.

2684
02:29:06,270 --> 02:29:08,690
Oh, they're teasing us hardcore.

2685
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:13,650
What if there's not a shot?

2686
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:15,270
gun at all in this game.

2687
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:21,660
Banana peel.

2688
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:24,080
That does not look like a banana peel.

2689
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:25,640
I'll say that.

2690
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:28,080
Oh, okay.

2691
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:32,620
I was gonna say that was a fun puzzle!

2692
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:36,760
Oh, my god.

2693
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:46,620
Oh, shoot.

2694
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:51,300
Ugh.

2695
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:55,060
I do not like you.

2696
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,020
Oh, my god.

2697
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:01,540
Boss.

2698
02:30:01,820 --> 02:30:03,230
There's actual bosses in this game.

2699
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:11,700
Wait, that was my exit.

2700
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:17,880
It opened when I disabled the trap, but when the brick wall
was broken, it got pushed closed again.

2701
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:20,220
Oh, it won't budge.

2702
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:21,400
There must be something I can do.

2703
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:24,000
Handle?

2704
02:30:24,340 --> 02:30:24,860
Pull it?

2705
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:27,980
Oh, okay.

2706
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:30,680
I broke it.

2707
02:30:36,130 --> 02:30:36,730
Interesting.

2708
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:47,940
Mayamo.

2709
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:51,020
Where are we?

2710
02:30:51,780 --> 02:30:52,980
Utility corridor.

2711
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:57,540
Wait, but there's a save in here it seems.

2712
02:30:59,380 --> 02:31:00,140
Is this a safe room?

2713
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:01,600
Oh, it is!

2714
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:05,540
Staring into the flames, I feel something.

2715
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:06,560
Yeah!

2716
02:31:10,270 --> 02:31:10,870
Yeah!

2717
02:31:15,470 --> 02:31:22,670
handwritten letter hey Ed what's been going on finally set
up the address you can use to send me the ore if you label

2718
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:30,330
the contents as samples of geological interest we can pass
it off as an academic research thing I'll collect the

2719
02:31:30,330 --> 02:31:36,650
shipments once a week and take them back up into the mine
hold on to your hat we're about to become the luckiest gold

2720
02:31:36,650 --> 02:31:41,090
miners since 1848 Yorika!

2721
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:43,510
Love Marv.

2722
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:50,240
Our tips here.

2723
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:52,120
I left the shotgun.

2724
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:53,760
There is a shotgun.

2725
02:31:54,820 --> 02:31:56,440
I left the shotgun in the submarine.

2726
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:58,320
Shark, shark, shark, shark, dolphin.

2727
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:01,160
At least I think that's the quickest way.

2728
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:02,380
I was never that good at math.

2729
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:03,260
Wait.

2730
02:32:03,560 --> 02:32:04,980
Oh, I'm taking a photo of this.

2731
02:32:05,060 --> 02:32:06,540
Why do I keep dropping my phone today?

2732
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:10,300
Shark.

2733
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:29,740
a picture shark shark shark shark dolphin write that down
write that down except i can take a photo field trips gather

2734
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:36,260
the kids in a group outside the haunted manor choose the
older kid get them to ring the doorbell nothing will happen

2735
02:32:36,260 --> 02:32:43,260
laughter ensues then choose a younger kid and have them try
quietly tell them them the secret so they can get the door

2736
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:43,760
to open.

2737
02:32:44,260 --> 02:32:45,780
Impressed gasps ensue.

2738
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:48,680
The secret is to ring the bell a specific number... Oh.

2739
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,040
I'm too smart for your tricks, for your tips.

2740
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:08,900
Glossy magazine.

2741
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:10,660
My ultimate...

2742
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:12,260
Oh, look at the ladies on the wall.

2743
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:13,440
Barf.

2744
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:14,420
No, thanks.

2745
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:17,760
Mara doesn't know what's good.

2746
02:33:19,620 --> 02:33:22,560
Watch out for chandelier traps hanging from the ceiling.

2747
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:24,980
So what?

2748
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:28,560
I've never seen the gas one either.

2749
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:32,440
This is the staff memos.

2750
02:33:32,860 --> 02:33:32,860
Okay.

2751
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:38,460
I feel like we should probably go back over those a little
bit to see what I have missed.

2752
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:51,900
I'm in the machine room.

2753
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,980
They're just processing gold.

2754
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:02,580
There's gold.

2755
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:03,700
Oh my god.

2756
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:07,240
There's a bunch of rocks in a funnel at the top.

2757
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:13,320
Wait, it's...

2758
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:13,780
No.

2759
02:34:16,060 --> 02:34:18,320
It's making fake gold ore.

2760
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:25,640
Right?

2761
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:27,000
Yeah, it's the reverse.

2762
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:28,940
This is coming out.

2763
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:29,640
Wait, what's this?

2764
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:31,900
Small tank of gasoline, I'll take it.

2765
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:38,660
And then they put in the pieces, and then they make it look
like gold ore.

2766
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:41,100
Scared.

2767
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:41,880
Come factory!

2768
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:44,480
Oh my gosh.

2769
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:47,680
Oh.

2770
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:51,520
I think it's grinding up the golden tubes.

2771
02:34:51,900 --> 02:34:54,500
Kind of reminds me of a mortar and pestle.

2772
02:34:57,800 --> 02:34:58,900
That's fun.

2773
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:00,100
That's very funny.

2774
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:08,440
I like to resave after I've collected things.

2775
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:10,680
So, um...

2776
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:14,300
Down this hallway, there's another thing.

2777
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:16,220
There's a room to the left.

2778
02:35:18,140 --> 02:35:20,720
And then this fatal error elevator.

2779
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:28,020
And whatever's down here.

2780
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:32,000
This sounds like...

2781
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:34,000
I don't... I don't know.

2782
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:36,240
A vent?

2783
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:37,520
Is there something inside?

2784
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:39,680
Wait, is it this door that's going?

2785
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:44,000
The sound design in this game is a little awkward.

2786
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:46,880
There's a book.

2787
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:49,240
Tombstone.

2788
02:35:50,600 --> 02:35:51,540
Tom B.

2789
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:52,220
Stone.

2790
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:54,440
The year Solina died.

2791
02:35:54,860 --> 02:35:55,900
Looks very well read.

2792
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:57,160
Is it some kind of clue?

2793
02:35:57,960 --> 02:35:58,480
Solina.

2794
02:35:58,980 --> 02:36:00,920
Didn't I say that name somewhere else just a minute ago?

2795
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:01,900
I did.

2796
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,540
Wasn't it in the crypt?

2797
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:05,980
Wait, the year Solina died.

2798
02:36:10,980 --> 02:36:11,160
Oh.

2799
02:36:15,990 --> 02:36:17,870
Wait, this is the lady knocking, no?

2800
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:21,790
No.

2801
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:22,370
Wait.

2802
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:22,790
Oh.

2803
02:36:23,450 --> 02:36:24,070
Yes, it is.

2804
02:36:24,210 --> 02:36:24,950
I thought it was a monster.

2805
02:36:26,810 --> 02:36:28,230
Hey, how did you get inside?

2806
02:36:28,830 --> 02:36:29,610
I went through the crypt.

2807
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:33,550
There was this tombstone puzzle and a shotgun and a sticking
clock.

2808
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:35,690
Okay, I didn't ask for your life story.

2809
02:36:37,410 --> 02:36:37,730
Sorry.

2810
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:39,150
I'm just kidding.

2811
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:39,990
You did get all right.

2812
02:36:40,910 --> 02:36:42,290
Now there's work to be done.

2813
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:51,930
Oh, she's like judging.

2814
02:36:53,430 --> 02:36:55,290
Wait, the year Solina died.

2815
02:36:55,410 --> 02:36:57,030
So we gotta go back to the crypt, right?

2816
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:06,100
Which one is Solina?

2817
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:07,380
Oh!

2818
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:11,400
1872, everybody.

2819
02:37:12,220 --> 02:37:14,700
I'm just taking pictures of everything.

2820
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:18,880
1872.

2821
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:23,560
I feel like I've seen another...

2822
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:26,580
Hadlock somewhere.

2823
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,000
We'll talk to her in a second.

2824
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:32,100
A cell?

2825
02:37:32,740 --> 02:37:33,540
A cell?

2826
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:48,200
Why is there a jail cell in, though?

2827
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:50,840
There's no question.

2828
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:52,440
What's your usual Taco Bell order?

2829
02:37:52,660 --> 02:37:54,840
I'm planning on getting some tonight.

2830
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:56,900
Golden Foxy.

2831
02:37:57,560 --> 02:38:00,080
Um, I pick between three things.

2832
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:02,440
One, the five-layer burrito.

2833
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:05,820
Two, the crunch wrap.

2834
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:11,060
Or three, I get two hard shell tacos.

2835
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:18,860
with beans instead of meat and sour cream yeah

2836
02:38:24,550 --> 02:38:27,330
those are my three orders

2837
02:38:32,310 --> 02:38:44,670
oh that I stretch okay it's a notebook Tolman's records
March 24th 1988 boss and I have to have the store room

2838
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:50,790
converted into a holding cell Pike isn't happy about it he
says can't legally hold people here even if they've

2839
02:38:50,790 --> 02:38:59,210
committed a crime within the park i tell him it's not for
criminals oh my gosh you guys don't need to be doing your

2840
02:38:59,210 --> 02:39:02,210
business at the park

2841
02:39:05,870 --> 02:39:15,730
every taco bell is about to run out of crunch raft now no
they are they are they are pretty good though no boss brings

2842
02:39:15,730 --> 02:39:20,250
the guest up here locks it in the cell he wants to run some
tests.

2843
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:26,850
He says it will be much quicker if he doesn't have to travel
down to the lab each time.

2844
02:39:27,870 --> 02:39:32,430
I think it is a very bad idea to bring the guest up to the
surface, especially while the park is still open.

2845
02:39:32,530 --> 02:39:34,830
So the elevator there goes to the lab, eh?

2846
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:35,910
I see.

2847
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:38,290
Almost immediately, I am proven right.

2848
02:39:38,670 --> 02:39:45,010
A girl named Elaine Marshall finds her way into the holding
cell and encourages the, oh no, sorry, encounters the guest.

2849
02:39:45,950 --> 02:39:47,230
She's encouraging him.

2850
02:39:47,470 --> 02:39:48,490
She's egging him on.

2851
02:39:48,510 --> 02:39:54,190
she's like the brecky crunch trap is pretty i've never had
that one

2852
02:39:58,070 --> 02:40:06,070
boss metal gear mentioned wait why is elaine up here in the
cell though that's what i have to wonder it sounds like she

2853
02:40:06,070 --> 02:40:12,070
is in an area that she shouldn't be in boss is forced to
close the park i fear this is not the end but the beginning

2854
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:23,530
so that's what happened to her it can be unlocked the switch
under the under that floor panel what oh this one

2855
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:41,550
the cell door unlocked simple as simple as simple as that
and that's oh oops sorry my bad uh let's do ouchy an

2856
02:40:41,550 --> 02:40:49,110
antidote uh anything oh i'll take that

2857
02:41:00,110 --> 02:41:01,170
It's a bed.

2858
02:41:02,170 --> 02:41:03,870
It smells strongly of bleach.

2859
02:41:06,770 --> 02:41:08,130
Oh, a large medkin.

2860
02:41:08,990 --> 02:41:10,190
It pays to explore.

2861
02:41:11,190 --> 02:41:13,170
Does the guests need to use the restroom?

2862
02:41:15,290 --> 02:41:16,090
Maybe it does.

2863
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:21,250
All right, let's go talk to our friend over here.

2864
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:24,430
What are you doing?

2865
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:26,790
Miss Julie here.

2866
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:29,370
Yeah, I think this is the best spot.

2867
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:31,070
The best spot for what?

2868
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:33,130
I assume he uses that elevator.

2869
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:34,790
So he'll see it for sure.

2870
02:41:35,610 --> 02:41:36,870
Are you talking about Edward Crow?

2871
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:37,890
Yeah.

2872
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:41,150
Hey, would you help me out with something?

2873
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:42,530
Sure.

2874
02:41:43,690 --> 02:41:44,490
What do you need me to do?

2875
02:41:45,690 --> 02:41:48,670
I need to clear off these tables and then lie out some
documents.

2876
02:41:48,890 --> 02:41:51,990
Are you asking me to take these naughty magazines?

2877
02:41:52,970 --> 02:41:58,130
Oh my gosh, are you asking me to like take them off your
hands and, you know, store them somewhere?

2878
02:41:58,770 --> 02:42:00,010
I think I could do...

2879
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:03,970
Oh my gosh, it's a big ask, but, you know, I'll handle it.

2880
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:09,370
I'll be the bigger person here, and I'll handle all these
dirty adult magazines.

2881
02:42:10,370 --> 02:42:11,670
No worries, these thin books?

2882
02:42:13,370 --> 02:42:15,170
I can take care of it.

2883
02:42:15,470 --> 02:42:16,330
Don't you worry.

2884
02:42:18,750 --> 02:42:19,810
Her music is so nice.

2885
02:42:20,050 --> 02:42:22,630
I need to clear off these tables and then lay out some of
the documents.

2886
02:42:23,490 --> 02:42:24,510
It won't take a minute.

2887
02:42:29,250 --> 02:42:33,050
Minto is so generous I know Where'd all the stuff go?

2888
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:34,250
What'd we do with it, Julie?

2889
02:42:34,730 --> 02:42:35,690
Julie, what'd you do with it?

2890
02:42:36,370 --> 02:42:36,930
That'll do it.

2891
02:42:37,070 --> 02:42:37,670
Thanks for the help.

2892
02:42:39,350 --> 02:42:40,010
That takes care of that.

2893
02:42:40,310 --> 02:42:41,270
Hopefully he'll see it.

2894
02:42:41,930 --> 02:42:43,650
While I'm here, I'm going to take a look at the cell.

2895
02:42:44,910 --> 02:42:45,610
Did you go in it?

2896
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:47,510
Yeah, there's not much to see.

2897
02:42:48,450 --> 02:42:48,770
Fair enough.

2898
02:42:49,750 --> 02:42:50,370
Well, catch you later.

2899
02:42:50,570 --> 02:42:51,610
Stay out of trouble, alright?

2900
02:42:57,580 --> 02:42:58,480
Is she really in there?

2901
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:01,700
Oh, she is.

2902
02:43:02,660 --> 02:43:03,060
What do you think?

2903
02:43:03,800 --> 02:43:04,640
Well, here we are.

2904
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:07,220
The incident that closed down Crow Country.

2905
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:08,560
It happened right here.

2906
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:10,240
The bite of 87.

2907
02:43:12,180 --> 02:43:12,880
Did you notice?

2908
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:14,580
It's been deep cleaned.

2909
02:43:16,220 --> 02:43:19,240
Of course, that in itself is a form of evidence.

2910
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:23,320
You mean the fact that they had this room cleaned?

2911
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:26,900
The bite of 67.

2912
02:43:27,980 --> 02:43:29,480
It's proof that something happened?

2913
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:38,480
thing they want to cover up right no smoke without fire as
they say no bleach without blood oh my gosh if you guys

2914
02:43:38,480 --> 02:43:52,360
bleach your clothes evidence oh that's good I'm gonna start
saying that it's okay you don't need to stay I'm sure you

2915
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:59,860

2916
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:07,560
office it's in the northeast corner of the park i think
northeast sounds like you need to pass through the haunted

2917
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:16,820
manor right thanks julie which we did we're maybe we've gone
a little out of order i think it sounds like they wanted me

2918
02:44:16,820 --> 02:44:26,000
to go into the crypt oh before going into um into the
haunted manor we went a little backwards but

2919
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:31,720
Bleach is so harsh on materials.

2920
02:44:32,180 --> 02:44:33,520
Yeah, it's a newspaper.

2921
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:35,640
The Atlanta Globe.

2922
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:37,480
Incident at the local theme park.

2923
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:38,620
Oh my gosh.

2924
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:43,220
How sassy are they going to be?

2925
02:44:43,700 --> 02:44:49,060
Parents, Luke and Patricia Marshall decided to take their
daughter Elaine to a local theme park for her 15th birthday.

2926
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:50,540
She was 15!

2927
02:44:51,220 --> 02:44:52,240
Okay, I'm sorry.

2928
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:58,280
She's old enough to know not to go into the back rooms of a
theme park.

2929
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:04,400
15 I thought she was like six or seven

2930
02:45:12,410 --> 02:45:25,230
it's like come on you should know not to go oh my god I
didn't mean to say seven or eight I thought she was six or

2931
02:45:25,230 --> 02:45:37,260
eight you know what I let's take a break I'm gonna go get
some water I'll be right back I'll let you guys get it out

2933
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:31,890
i'm back that.

2934
02:47:32,670 --> 02:47:34,030
I got a cough drop too.

2935
02:47:36,050 --> 02:47:37,310
These ones are crazy.

2936
02:47:38,210 --> 02:47:45,690
These cough drops are insane because they literally I didn't
know that you could get this over the counter.

2937
02:47:45,870 --> 02:47:47,170
They numb your throat.

2938
02:47:49,450 --> 02:47:51,730
they numb your mouth basically.

2939
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:54,490
I was like is this allowed?

2940
02:48:00,150 --> 02:48:01,930
What What flavor?

2941
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:09,210
Uh, their Vix Vapo Cool Severe Intense Pain Relief.

2942
02:48:10,050 --> 02:48:11,590
Soothes and Numb Sores Throats.

2943
02:48:11,750 --> 02:48:12,330
Icy Mint!

2944
02:48:13,170 --> 02:48:14,510
It's an icy mint flavor.

2945
02:48:15,670 --> 02:48:22,390
It has menthol and benzocaine in it.

2946
02:48:22,830 --> 02:48:23,230
Crazy.

2947
02:48:25,710 --> 02:48:28,170
First time I tried it, I didn't know that it would numb me.

2948
02:48:29,950 --> 02:48:30,690
Okay.

2949
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:32,810
All right.

2950
02:48:34,530 --> 02:48:42,750
Curl Country, named for its owner, one Edward Curl, is a
small amusement park found only a few miles southeast of

2951
02:48:42,750 --> 02:48:43,190
Atlanta.

2952
02:48:43,890 --> 02:48:49,470
It's fair to say that it's been fairly popular with locals,
but never really drew in the big crowds of some of its

2953
02:48:49,470 --> 02:48:50,530
larger competitors.

2954
02:48:50,870 --> 02:48:52,750
This person is so shady.

2955
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:55,210
Oh my gosh, how is that relevant?

2956
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:05,740
The Marshall family were walking through the haunted hilltop
section of the park when Elaine became separated from her

2957
02:49:05,740 --> 02:49:06,340
parents.

2958
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:11,400
Around half an hour later, Elaine reappeared.

2959
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:15,920
She was visibly very upset and had a patch of blood marked.

2960
02:49:16,340 --> 02:49:18,180
And a patch of blood marked the front of her t-shirt.

2961
02:49:18,700 --> 02:49:23,820
It seems Elaine had wandered into a restricted section of
the park and encountered something or someone very

2962
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:24,320
dangerous.

2963
02:49:24,580 --> 02:49:30,240
Yeah, a restricted section of the park where you should not
have been, 15-year-old Elaine.

2964
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:32,300
Like, what the hell?

2965
02:49:32,620 --> 02:49:33,360
Why are we...

2966
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,180
I'm sorry, we're supposed to protect her?

2967
02:49:38,860 --> 02:49:39,600
Rage-baiting.

2968
02:49:39,720 --> 02:49:41,200
I seriously feel like it.

2969
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:52,100
Yesterday, Atlanta Central Radio got a direct quote from
Elaine herself speaking from her ward at Westview Hospital.

2970
02:49:52,660 --> 02:49:54,240
There was a man in a cage.

2971
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:55,480
Okay, that does sound pretty bad.

2972
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:56,200
I'm not going to lie.

2973
02:50:03,250 --> 02:50:04,390
She's so cute.

2974
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:07,670
It's a photo.

2975
02:50:09,570 --> 02:50:10,510
She's cute.

2976
02:50:11,410 --> 02:50:11,990
La la la.

2977
02:50:12,150 --> 02:50:12,650
I'm Elaine.

2978
02:50:12,850 --> 02:50:14,290
I go into restricted areas.

2979
02:50:15,950 --> 02:50:16,910
Medical report.

2980
02:50:17,310 --> 02:50:17,770
Elaine Marshall.

2981
02:50:19,530 --> 02:50:19,710
Injuries.

2982
02:50:20,110 --> 02:50:23,370
Wound across the stomach and chest, not healing due to a
bacterial infection.

2983
02:50:23,910 --> 02:50:26,690
Attempts to identify the nature of the bacteria are still
ongoing.

2984
02:50:27,390 --> 02:50:28,250
Suspected cause of injury.

2985
02:50:28,590 --> 02:50:29,550
Attacked by a wild animal.

2986
02:50:30,550 --> 02:50:33,470
Unsubstantiated claim by the patient that she was attacked
by a person.

2987
02:50:34,130 --> 02:50:35,850
Are you enjoying this game more than expected, Minky?

2988
02:50:36,710 --> 02:50:42,530
enjoying it don't don't yeah I'm definitely enjoying it I
want to say more than expected I was always curious about

2989
02:50:42,530 --> 02:50:57,020
the plot I think it has a little more humor than I expected
which I always am I'm always a big fan of and gameplay wise

2990
02:50:57,020 --> 02:51:04,020
it doesn't seem it seems pretty forgiving so I'm so far I'm
not I'm not struggling or anything treatment ongoing

2991
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:09,120
treatment of bacterial infection currently no improvement
shown notes patient also complains of ongoing headaches and

2992
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:14,860
queasiness oh no she needs the she needs the antidote
further treatment pending legal agreement between Marshall

levity yeah

2994

2996
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:49,920
Wait, one second?

2997
02:51:59,440 --> 02:52:00,260
Uh, one second?

2998
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:03,940
Okay.

2999
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:09,100
404 numbers are a little hard to come by.

3000
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:09,660
Are they?

3001
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:11,900
Why is that?

3002
02:52:14,100 --> 02:52:15,620
Did they use them all up?

3003
02:52:17,620 --> 02:52:19,120
Uh, did I read this one?

3004
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:20,580
Yeah, the chandelier traps.

3005
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:22,560
Okay.

3006
02:52:24,500 --> 02:52:25,020
after.

3007
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:30,340
404.

3008
02:52:30,580 --> 02:52:31,640
Oh, not found.

3009
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:33,640
It's a bottle containing antidote.

3010
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:35,520
Wait, I can't contain.

3011
02:52:35,700 --> 02:52:37,560
Oh, oh, I can't carry anymore.

3012
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:39,000
What do I have?

3013
02:52:39,140 --> 02:52:39,640
Oh, I have five.

3014
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:41,580
You can only carry five of each.

3015
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:42,360
Okay.

3016
02:52:50,510 --> 02:52:52,330
The year Solina died.

3017
02:52:52,850 --> 02:52:54,550
Wait, there's a safe right here.

3018
02:52:55,810 --> 02:52:57,050
I just noticed this.

3019
02:52:58,150 --> 02:52:58,830
Hold on.

3020
02:52:59,750 --> 02:53:03,830
I'm gonna, I took a picture Dodd.

3021
02:53:04,470 --> 02:53:04,950
1872?

3022
02:53:08,190 --> 02:53:08,670
Oh.

3023
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:11,050
I messed it up.

3024
02:53:14,770 --> 02:53:15,250
Nice.

3025
02:53:17,630 --> 02:53:18,450
Oh, yeah.

3026
02:53:18,890 --> 02:53:20,690
There is a big red arrow, isn't there?

3027
02:53:24,340 --> 02:53:25,380
The crank handle!

3028
02:53:25,900 --> 02:53:26,500
What was this for?

3029
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:30,980
Oh, took the crank handle.

3030
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:32,040
Wait, what was it?

3031
02:53:32,200 --> 02:53:32,600
Hold on.

3032
02:53:32,660 --> 02:53:34,300
Let's go look at the staff memos again.

3033
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:35,700
Wait.

3034
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:37,040
Is there a memo here?

3035
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:39,780
Do I need to get rid of this?

3036
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:42,180
Wait, I think I can go around.

3037
02:53:46,460 --> 02:53:50,560
A reminder that the piano in the haunted manor is not to be
used for casual playing is wired up to the walls and the

3038
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:51,700
whole system is pretty fragile.

3039
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:53,080
If you're not haunted manor staff leave.

3040
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:55,680
These are all stuff I think I really went in the wrong
order.

3041
02:54:01,140 --> 02:54:03,480
This has the staff memos.

3042
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:03,880
Okay.

3043
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:14,560
Oh, so to get to Tolman's office is the fairy pond.

3044
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:16,980
So that's the area that I went to, maybe.

3045
02:54:21,820 --> 02:54:24,340
So we still have the Swan puzzle.

3046
02:54:29,410 --> 02:54:31,610
Dixite access is in that cute little house.

3047
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:37,120
So there's a keyhole in the mailbox.

3048
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:41,220
We did this one.

3049
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:44,400
Uh...

3050
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:46,140
Which wood has the trident?

3051
02:54:46,980 --> 02:54:48,160
Which we need to get in there.

3052
02:54:48,360 --> 02:54:50,520
We don't... We are not able to get in there yet.

3053
02:54:57,280 --> 02:54:58,500
Eggs are going missing.

3054
02:54:58,660 --> 02:54:59,980
We need a thing that looks like an egg.

3055
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:04,930
Railway room.

3056
02:55:08,750 --> 02:55:09,570
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3057
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:11,210
And the dungeon.

3058
02:55:11,350 --> 02:55:11,970
Oh, that's right!

3059
02:55:12,090 --> 02:55:14,050
The railway... Railway room and the dungeon.

3060
02:55:14,270 --> 02:55:14,650
Yes, yes.

3061
02:55:14,690 --> 02:55:15,750
We've seen both of those now.

3062
02:55:19,470 --> 02:55:23,630
I wonder if I read the book titles, I wonder what it is.

3063
02:55:28,970 --> 02:55:33,450
I think we can try the grenade, but I really don't think
it's a...

3064
02:55:33,450 --> 02:55:35,930
Game is meant to be pretty open, so playthrough looks pretty
different.

3065
02:55:36,750 --> 02:55:38,050
You can do a lot of puzzles out of order.

3066
02:55:38,170 --> 02:55:38,650
You are doing great.

3067
02:55:38,730 --> 02:55:39,810
Thank you, first time!

3068
02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:40,930
Thank you!

3069
02:55:46,090 --> 02:55:46,810
Here we go.

3070
02:55:47,410 --> 02:55:51,710
If you're doing maintenance in the haunted manner or trying
to access Ocean King you'll need the crank handle.

3071
02:55:53,230 --> 02:55:53,910
Which we got.

3072
02:55:56,250 --> 02:55:57,710
Maintenance in the haunted manner.

3073
02:56:00,410 --> 02:56:02,890
What did I need the crank handle in the haunted manner for?

3074
02:56:07,150 --> 02:56:07,590
Oh, wait.

3075
02:56:09,930 --> 02:56:10,990
Maybe that devil?

3076
02:56:13,770 --> 02:56:15,310
Trying to access Ocean Kingdom.

3077
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:18,570
Oh, the clocks!

3078
02:56:18,730 --> 02:56:19,350
That's right!

3079
02:56:20,410 --> 02:56:26,970
They say don't touch the clocks unless you have the proper
stuff, which we do now, so...

3080
02:56:32,940 --> 02:56:33,240
Oh!

3081
02:56:34,900 --> 02:56:35,620
Hello.

3082
02:56:38,380 --> 02:56:38,760
Goodbye.

3083
02:56:39,180 --> 02:56:39,360
Oh!

3084
02:56:39,940 --> 02:56:40,120
Goodbye.

3085
02:56:49,590 --> 02:56:51,070
Just gonna...

3086
02:56:51,070 --> 02:56:52,130
Sorry.

3087
02:56:52,930 --> 02:56:53,530
Oh my goodness.

3088
02:56:55,710 --> 02:56:56,450
345.

3089
02:56:57,030 --> 02:56:58,630
There's a hole in the middle of the clock face.

3090
02:57:00,870 --> 02:57:03,030
A crank can be turned left or right.

3091
02:57:03,470 --> 02:57:05,630
Was there a time I needed to crank it to?

3092
02:57:07,770 --> 02:57:08,310
240?

3093
02:57:46,770 --> 02:57:47,730
I don't know.

3094
02:58:03,490 --> 02:58:04,970
Ah, this one too!

3095
02:58:11,970 --> 02:58:14,010
Boy, I want to see what this is.

3096
02:58:15,350 --> 02:58:17,070
History is deadliest poisons.

3097
02:58:17,630 --> 02:58:18,450
Leave it.

3098
02:58:20,670 --> 02:58:23,170
History is deadliest po- Leave it!

3099
02:58:26,850 --> 02:58:29,210
A swift and sudden end.

3100
02:58:30,150 --> 02:58:31,330
I'm so curious.

3101
02:58:31,830 --> 02:58:32,710
Leave it.

3102
02:58:32,770 --> 02:58:33,990
Leave it.

3103
02:58:41,910 --> 02:58:43,390
OT Plegis.

3104
02:58:52,230 --> 02:58:53,270
Save and try it.

3105
02:58:53,390 --> 02:58:53,630
I know.

3106
02:58:54,150 --> 02:58:56,190
I did just save before I came in here.

3107
02:58:58,050 --> 02:58:58,510
Oh my god.

3108
02:58:59,590 --> 02:58:59,990
Eh.

3109
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:03,470
I wanted to go.

3110
02:59:03,490 --> 02:59:05,490
go back to see the...

3111
02:59:07,070 --> 02:59:09,010
The what's it called?

3112
02:59:14,870 --> 02:59:15,530
Oh wait!

3113
02:59:17,030 --> 02:59:19,550
1020 and 1115.

3114
02:59:25,070 --> 02:59:26,750
This one definitely went to 1020.

3115
02:59:30,690 --> 02:59:31,630
1020.

3116
02:59:38,380 --> 02:59:43,330
There we go!

3117
02:59:43,830 --> 02:59:44,270
Eww!

3118
02:59:47,090 --> 02:59:48,130
Large gemstone.

3119
02:59:49,250 --> 02:59:50,530
This is for the swan!

3120
02:59:52,250 --> 02:59:52,730
Yeah!

3121
02:59:53,210 --> 02:59:54,110
We got it!

3122
02:59:54,250 --> 02:59:55,670
Okay, okay, nice.

3123
02:59:56,470 --> 02:59:57,710
Which, um, let's see.

3124
02:59:57,870 --> 02:59:58,930
If we...

3125
02:59:59,910 --> 03:00:01,290
We're at the haunted manor.

3126
03:00:02,710 --> 03:00:05,470
If we go through the theater...

3127
03:00:06,170 --> 03:00:07,910
We're at the haunted manor right there.

3128
03:00:08,310 --> 03:00:10,670
If we go through the theater, we can get to the swan boat.

3129
03:00:12,090 --> 03:00:13,070
I believe.

3130
03:00:13,070 --> 03:00:36,870
that way we avoid some stuff we'll go that way then well
actually I can't tell which would be faster actually they're

3131
03:00:36,870 --> 03:00:45,870
actually maybe about the same aren't they yeah fairy town is
kind of full of enemies I would be good cleaning up very

3132
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:46,470
well.

3133
03:00:48,370 --> 03:00:50,350
Main halls are faster, but full of enemies.

3134
03:00:51,450 --> 03:00:53,090
We'll just go through here then.

3135
03:00:54,190 --> 03:00:54,710
Oh, just kidding.

3136
03:00:55,330 --> 03:00:56,190
Wrong way.

3137
03:01:05,530 --> 03:01:06,610
Good boy.

3138
03:01:19,650 --> 03:01:20,470
You say something?

3139
03:01:21,170 --> 03:01:21,450
Silly?

3140
03:01:23,190 --> 03:01:24,630
I wonder if there's still guys in here.

3141
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:31,330
I do wonder, though, if, uh...

3142
03:01:33,390 --> 03:01:34,070
Let's see.

3143
03:01:35,270 --> 03:01:35,910
I go out.

3144
03:01:36,030 --> 03:01:36,590
I don't know.

3145
03:01:36,810 --> 03:01:38,630
It might have actually been...

3146
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:40,670
Maybe we're okay.

3147
03:01:41,070 --> 03:01:41,810
Maybe it's fine.

3148
03:01:42,610 --> 03:01:44,770
We just gotta leave and go to the left.

3149
03:01:45,730 --> 03:01:46,330
To the left.

3150
03:01:46,550 --> 03:01:47,130
To the left.

3151
03:01:49,110 --> 03:01:49,870
Oh my god.

3152
03:01:50,110 --> 03:01:50,550
I can't see.

3153
03:01:50,730 --> 03:01:51,130
Where am I?

3154
03:01:51,370 --> 03:01:51,670
Out!

3155
03:01:51,970 --> 03:01:52,150
Out!

3156
03:01:52,550 --> 03:01:52,690
Out!

3157
03:01:56,150 --> 03:01:56,590
Here?

3158
03:01:59,570 --> 03:02:00,010
Yes.

3159
03:02:00,270 --> 03:02:00,670
Oh my god.

3160
03:02:00,750 --> 03:02:01,730
There's things in here too though.

3161
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:04,010
Okay, yeah, I gotta.

3162
03:02:06,510 --> 03:02:09,130
Oh, there we go.

3163
03:02:11,070 --> 03:02:11,710
Caution!

3164
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:16,580
We're fine.

3165
03:02:16,820 --> 03:02:20,980
You're just stocking up on enemies for the maximum numbers
of fatalities you achieve for grenades.

3166
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:22,020
Of course!

3167
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:23,820
No shame and efficiency.

3168
03:02:24,420 --> 03:02:26,460
That's exactly what I've been doing.

3169
03:02:28,020 --> 03:02:28,960
Of course!

3170
03:02:33,530 --> 03:02:36,110
I feel like a grenade would have worked just for me.

3171
03:02:36,130 --> 03:02:37,770
perfectly fine for this puzzle.

3172
03:02:38,390 --> 03:02:39,030
Just saying.

3173
03:02:40,410 --> 03:02:41,550
The lay has turned green.

3174
03:02:41,990 --> 03:02:42,590
Turn the wheel.

3175
03:02:51,140 --> 03:02:52,560
I think I'm going the wrong way.

3176
03:02:58,140 --> 03:02:59,280
We needed to come to us, right?

3177
03:02:59,340 --> 03:03:00,140
So we can get the chain.

3178
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:06,400
Let's get that grody chin off your neck.

3179
03:03:08,900 --> 03:03:09,140
Oh!

3180
03:03:11,420 --> 03:03:12,540
Oh my god.

3181
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:14,840
I got the chin.

3182
03:03:15,440 --> 03:03:15,820
I did.

3183
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:20,400
I hope there wasn't anything else in there that I needed.

3184
03:03:23,240 --> 03:03:24,440
The music sounds so funny.

3185
03:03:24,860 --> 03:03:25,600
It's like too whimsical.

3186
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:29,100
Um, alright.

3187
03:03:40,120 --> 03:03:41,580
The hatchlings are motherless.

3188
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:43,180
I think they'll be okay.

3189
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:48,700
It still says that there's something in the theater we need
to do.

3190
03:03:49,220 --> 03:03:49,580
Interesting.

3191
03:03:50,760 --> 03:03:51,780
But, um...

3192
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:53,140
Let's go to the train room.

3193
03:03:53,640 --> 03:03:54,440
And we shall save.

3194
03:04:02,020 --> 03:04:03,140
Holy cow.

3195
03:04:03,380 --> 03:04:03,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3196
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:21,780
I hate that it switches the camera on me when I exit a room.

3197
03:04:24,700 --> 03:04:27,520
I probably should have saved a different file, but that's
okay.

3198
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:32,600
My condition is okay.

3199
03:04:33,900 --> 03:04:35,300
Now let's get the...

3200
03:04:37,020 --> 03:04:37,580
Thing.

3201
03:04:39,300 --> 03:04:40,600
No, no, not you.

3202
03:04:41,140 --> 03:04:42,500
The Book of Staff, Memo.

3203
03:04:44,060 --> 03:04:44,240
Hmm.

3204
03:04:45,300 --> 03:04:46,980
I have to father them now.

3205
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:48,300
It's me.

3206
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:50,020
I am the father.

3207
03:04:57,370 --> 03:04:58,570
Something about this chain.

3208
03:04:59,030 --> 03:04:59,190
Oh!

3209
03:05:01,490 --> 03:05:02,450
The machine chain.

3210
03:05:03,390 --> 03:05:04,930
Which machine chain, though?

3211
03:05:05,090 --> 03:05:06,690
I wish it would tell me where.

3212
03:05:11,820 --> 03:05:14,160
The machine chain for where, though.

3213
03:05:22,910 --> 03:05:34,710
was there anything else um which wood we still got to get
into there's a room you haven't been to yet I mean there's a

3214
03:05:34,710 --> 03:05:38,390

3215
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:43,260
the one across from swan boat

3216
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:48,320
I gotta go back up there

3217
03:05:54,200 --> 03:06:00,900
I guess I don't even think I tried it seem like i did all

yes oh i did it again Oh my gosh, what's wrong with me?

3222
03:06:42,490 --> 03:06:43,870
I think I should...

3223
03:06:43,870 --> 03:06:45,170
Um, maybe...

3224
03:06:45,170 --> 03:06:46,570
Wait, uh, throw a grenade.

3225
03:06:47,530 --> 03:06:48,470
Oh, run away.

3226
03:06:49,470 --> 03:06:51,110
Oh, well I killed something.

3227
03:06:51,470 --> 03:06:51,510
Oh!

3228
03:06:54,610 --> 03:06:54,730
Ah!

3229
03:06:55,130 --> 03:06:55,350
Ouch!

3230
03:07:04,180 --> 03:07:04,400
Good.

3231
03:07:09,390 --> 03:07:10,830
I'm trying to...

3232
03:07:10,830 --> 03:07:11,710
zip around him.

3233
03:07:12,290 --> 03:07:12,750
Oh my gosh.

3234
03:07:16,330 --> 03:07:17,250
Holy cow.

3235
03:07:17,610 --> 03:07:18,050
Aim, don't go.

3236
03:07:18,130 --> 03:07:19,670
Hey, I'm on a controller, okay?

3237
03:07:20,130 --> 03:07:21,490
Give me some...

3238
03:07:22,010 --> 03:07:24,070
Give me some grace here.

3239
03:07:28,370 --> 03:07:29,290
Oh, here...

3240
03:07:34,230 --> 03:07:35,150
Little house.

3241
03:07:36,770 --> 03:07:37,610
It's locked.

3242
03:07:37,750 --> 03:07:38,530
There's no keyhole.

3243
03:07:39,710 --> 03:07:40,570
What about the post-op?

3244
03:07:40,650 --> 03:07:41,830
Oh, here we go.

3245
03:07:42,430 --> 03:07:43,370
Ah, okay, okay.

3246
03:07:44,990 --> 03:07:45,450
Okay.

3247
03:07:48,350 --> 03:07:50,270
Good thing I'm not getting any taller.

3248
03:08:12,560 --> 03:08:13,400
Oh, that's sick.

3249
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:15,720
Oh, that's sick.

3250
03:08:20,980 --> 03:08:23,700
If you can't find the crank handle, it's because I borrowed
it.

3251
03:08:24,040 --> 03:08:27,860
I use it to hide that big egg-shaped ruby inside the haunted
manor.

3252
03:08:28,580 --> 03:08:32,720
Afterwards, I locked the crank handle in a safe in the
southeast utility corner.

3253
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:34,060
I see.

3254
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:35,980
Mounted weapon.

3255
03:08:36,420 --> 03:08:37,520
There's a valve on the top.

3256
03:08:41,640 --> 03:08:42,120
I see.

3257
03:08:42,300 --> 03:08:43,260
I think it's low on view.

3258
03:08:53,480 --> 03:08:58,320
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hauls
again!

3259
03:09:01,940 --> 03:09:04,620
Tolman's Records, June 3rd, 1986.

3260
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:07,240
We hired a company to start excavating.

3261
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:08,560
It didn't go to plan.

3262
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:11,700
Problem one, they spent too long setting up the site.

3263
03:09:12,220 --> 03:09:15,100
Problem two, there was already a paper trail forming.

3264
03:09:15,320 --> 03:09:17,800
The whole point was to do this quickly and quietly.

3265
03:09:18,760 --> 03:09:19,640
Then the deal breaker.

3266
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:22,320
They started asking questions about the roots.

3267
03:09:24,520 --> 03:09:25,480
Comfy mochi.

3268
03:09:25,660 --> 03:09:26,980
Welcome to a bamboo ship.

3269
03:09:27,160 --> 03:09:27,800
Thank you.

3270
03:09:27,980 --> 03:09:29,100
Thank you so much.

3271
03:09:29,380 --> 03:09:29,980
Welcome, welcome.

3272
03:09:33,220 --> 03:09:37,640
They wanted to know the full size and shape of the thing
they were excavating.

3273
03:09:38,120 --> 03:09:40,020
They wanted to know what it was made of.

3274
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:43,460
They wanted to know how long it had been there.

3275
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:43,960
Uh-oh.

3276
03:09:44,300 --> 03:09:45,300
They were asking questions.

3277
03:09:45,320 --> 03:09:45,900
questions.

3278
03:09:46,520 --> 03:09:47,580
No deal, obviously.

3279
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:48,660
They had to go.

3280
03:09:54,210 --> 03:09:54,810
Okay.

3281
03:09:55,510 --> 03:09:56,790
Where do I put the crank in?

3282
03:09:57,010 --> 03:09:57,430
Oh, here?

3283
03:09:58,350 --> 03:09:58,990
There's a wheel?

3284
03:10:03,050 --> 03:10:04,230
The mechanism is incomplete.

3285
03:10:05,630 --> 03:10:06,410
That doesn't work.

3286
03:10:07,570 --> 03:10:08,270
Uh, oh.

3287
03:10:08,670 --> 03:10:08,870
This?

3288
03:10:09,550 --> 03:10:10,150
Ah!

3289
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,500
Something is holding onto the chain.

3290
03:10:18,700 --> 03:10:19,220
Wishbone!

3291
03:10:19,520 --> 03:10:20,480
Welcome back, thank you!

3292
03:10:22,600 --> 03:10:24,260
your enemies have more health than smaller enemies.

3293
03:10:24,620 --> 03:10:27,520
Consider this when making decisions about which ones to
fight and which weapons to use.

3294
03:10:28,100 --> 03:10:28,640
Thank you.

3295
03:10:29,360 --> 03:10:30,460
I don't like you saying that.

3296
03:10:34,240 --> 03:10:36,220
I don't like you saying that at all.

3297
03:10:38,100 --> 03:10:39,340
Grenade in the hole!

3298
03:10:45,630 --> 03:10:46,470
I wish...

3299
03:10:46,470 --> 03:10:47,130
Oh.

3300
03:10:49,370 --> 03:10:52,630
I was gonna say I wish I could figure out how to aim the
grenades.

3301
03:11:04,020 --> 03:11:04,860
What's in here?

3302
03:11:05,340 --> 03:11:07,680
There's probably a grenade right in this in here.

3303
03:11:08,220 --> 03:11:08,340
Oh.

3304
03:11:09,980 --> 03:11:10,720
Oh, no.

3305
03:11:10,920 --> 03:11:11,520
There's more ammo.

3306
03:11:14,820 --> 03:11:15,460
I'll take that.

3307
03:11:22,440 --> 03:11:23,480
Smells like gasoline.

3308
03:11:23,760 --> 03:11:24,100
But it's almost...

3309
03:11:24,100 --> 03:11:25,220
We add gasoline.

3310
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:26,020
We have some.

3311
03:11:26,040 --> 03:11:27,020
We have some gas tanks.

3312
03:11:27,660 --> 03:11:29,180
It's a good amount of gasoline inside.

3313
03:11:35,880 --> 03:11:36,400
Wait.

3314
03:11:37,720 --> 03:11:39,180
We don't have a flamethrower.

3315
03:11:40,280 --> 03:11:40,800
But...

3316
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:41,820
It calmed down.

3317
03:11:41,920 --> 03:11:49,540
there okay what else did I need to be doing here large metal
tank wonder what's

3318
03:11:53,890 --> 03:12:03,110
inside the fury if we go talk to the little mushroom guy
again is he gonna be like you have a flamethrower now

3319
03:12:03,110 --> 03:12:19,740
there's a I think they do want to say use the grenade you
guys okay do you think this is far enough maybe maybe Okay,

3320
03:12:19,820 --> 03:12:20,320
here we go.

3321
03:12:21,200 --> 03:12:21,820
One more try.

3322
03:12:32,340 --> 03:12:34,020
Try examining the pipes.

3323
03:12:36,500 --> 03:12:37,800
It's missing the handle.

3324
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:38,860
Oh, here we go.

3325
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:06,520
The mask!

3326
03:13:07,900 --> 03:13:10,040
It's a large block of solid resin.

3327
03:13:10,640 --> 03:13:11,840
There's something trapped inside.

3328
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:16,960
Come here.

3329
03:13:26,280 --> 03:13:28,580
Did you just give it the hose again?

3330
03:13:29,060 --> 03:13:30,160
I think so.

3331
03:13:34,690 --> 03:13:35,790
Something hanging.

3332
03:13:36,110 --> 03:13:36,290
Take it.

3333
03:13:37,790 --> 03:13:39,230
Woeful mask.

3334
03:13:41,190 --> 03:13:42,270
Sad guy.

3335
03:13:46,270 --> 03:13:47,790
Now we go...

3336
03:13:47,790 --> 03:13:49,530
You know, I wish this game had fast travel.

3337
03:13:55,880 --> 03:14:00,780
So now we go back to haunted hilltop.

3338
03:14:01,260 --> 03:14:03,060
This area is going to be hellish, though.

3339
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:06,140
Yeah, this will get us into the woods, though.

3340
03:14:18,630 --> 03:14:21,650
This area is going to be hellish because...

3341
03:14:22,230 --> 03:14:24,650
There's, like, some guys over here that are...

3342
03:14:26,950 --> 03:14:29,130
That have the big hands.

3343
03:14:29,770 --> 03:14:30,070
Okay.

3344
03:14:32,390 --> 03:14:33,270
Oh, my gosh.

3345
03:14:33,410 --> 03:14:34,230
Leave me alone.

3346
03:14:35,450 --> 03:14:36,210
Leave me alone.

3347
03:14:37,430 --> 03:14:38,950
I'm almost tempted to go get...

3348
03:14:38,950 --> 03:14:39,330
Ah!

3349
03:14:43,370 --> 03:14:43,850
Ew!

3350
03:14:44,630 --> 03:14:45,130
Okay, come on.

3351
03:14:45,290 --> 03:14:45,470
Ouch!

3352
03:14:46,010 --> 03:14:46,010
Ouch!

3353
03:14:46,530 --> 03:14:47,310
Oh my god, I'm poisoned.

3354
03:14:48,110 --> 03:14:48,590
Ugh.

3355
03:14:50,730 --> 03:14:51,390
Okay, we're fine.

3356
03:14:52,250 --> 03:14:53,750
Alright, let's put in the mask.

3357
03:14:55,150 --> 03:14:55,850
There's the item.

3358
03:14:58,730 --> 03:14:59,210
Yippee!

3359
03:14:59,850 --> 03:15:01,770
Or maybe, oh wait, let's go save!

3360
03:15:04,870 --> 03:15:06,250
Maybe not yippee.

3361
03:15:06,950 --> 03:15:09,750
Maybe we're not happy.

3362
03:15:13,350 --> 03:15:15,310
Maybe we don't want to go...

3363
03:15:15,830 --> 03:15:16,950
The 30th.

3364
03:15:21,480 --> 03:15:22,620
That's so strange.

3365
03:15:23,060 --> 03:15:25,680
I thought it was following the clock on my computer.

3366
03:15:30,720 --> 03:15:33,640
Oh, the camera doing that every time is very terrible.

3367
03:15:37,970 --> 03:15:38,130
Oh.

3368
03:15:51,580 --> 03:15:53,000
Oh, this seems hellish.

3369
03:15:53,620 --> 03:15:54,680
Okay, maybe I...

3370
03:15:54,680 --> 03:15:56,560
There's a symbol that looks like a swirl.

3371
03:15:57,720 --> 03:15:59,500
I'm not going to kick things just yet.

3372
03:16:01,880 --> 03:16:06,060
what the hell what the hell are they making here

3373
03:16:10,280 --> 03:16:13,120
oh there's a there's a health kit right behind you

3374
03:16:16,900 --> 03:16:34,730
um careful with the ceiling traps oh that's one of them
that's what it looks like I see if I shoot it whoa whoa whoa

3375
03:16:37,330 --> 03:16:40,730
Okay, it will only let me interact with this one.

3376
03:16:43,790 --> 03:16:48,370
Oh, and okay, so then the things that are eyes go down.

3377
03:16:49,610 --> 03:16:50,050
Interesting.

3378
03:16:53,670 --> 03:16:54,790
I will take that.

3379
03:17:04,540 --> 03:17:06,300
I think, I don't remember what this one was.

3380
03:17:07,740 --> 03:17:08,680
I guess it was a star.

3381
03:17:19,070 --> 03:17:20,590
The gas trap is what poison...

3382
03:17:20,590 --> 03:17:21,590
Yeah, the glowing gas.

3383
03:17:21,610 --> 03:17:36,690
trap yeah yeah yeah interesting let's see what's behind here
shotgun shells sure I guess I thought those were footprints

3384
03:17:36,690 --> 03:17:43,950
for a second and the I think they're leaves though Abel

3385
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:56,920
yeah I thought these were like they look like see on the
ground they look like like dinosaur dinosaur footprints or

3386
03:17:56,920 --> 03:17:57,260
something?

3387
03:17:58,680 --> 03:18:01,200
Let's do the swirly again.

3388
03:18:17,270 --> 03:18:18,610
That almost got me.

3389
03:18:18,750 --> 03:18:20,790
What is that red thing right there?

3390
03:18:28,110 --> 03:18:29,830
That almost had me, folks.

3391
03:18:34,740 --> 03:18:35,920
Not the eye.

3392
03:18:36,060 --> 03:18:41,000
Let's do the star real quick so I can get the stuff in here.

3393
03:18:42,960 --> 03:18:44,080
More ammo?

3394
03:18:44,400 --> 03:18:45,180
I'll take it!

3395
03:18:46,500 --> 03:18:47,640
Oh, it's a bottle!

3396
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:48,580
Oh, thank you.

3397
03:18:55,770 --> 03:18:56,330
Alrighty.

3398
03:18:57,110 --> 03:18:57,790
What's in there?

3399
03:18:58,810 --> 03:19:00,050
Maybe a gasoline tank?

3400
03:19:00,930 --> 03:19:01,310
Perhaps?

3401
03:19:07,280 --> 03:19:08,520
Oh, that's a grenade.

3402
03:19:12,900 --> 03:19:15,280
Are grenades that hard to come across in this game?

3403
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:22,940
I can't imagine these areas being, like, actual theme park.

3404
03:19:24,220 --> 03:19:26,960
You know, and maybe that's what's taking me out a little
bit.

3405
03:19:27,100 --> 03:19:31,120
I'm like, there is no feasible way that this would work in a
theme park.

3406
03:19:42,380 --> 03:19:43,140
Witch's cauldron.

3407
03:19:43,260 --> 03:19:44,240
It's full of murky water.

3408
03:19:44,360 --> 03:19:45,580
It smells really bad.

3409
03:19:47,580 --> 03:19:48,760
It's weirdly warm.

3410
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:50,160
Reach in further.

3411
03:19:50,740 --> 03:19:51,800
I can feel something at the bottom.

3412
03:19:51,960 --> 03:19:52,420
Grab it.

3413
03:19:52,940 --> 03:19:53,700
The Trident!

3414
03:19:57,880 --> 03:19:58,280
Oh.

3415
03:20:00,760 --> 03:20:01,820
Guys, I don't like that.

3416
03:20:26,180 --> 03:20:27,220
How's my health?

3417
03:20:28,020 --> 03:20:28,580
We're okay.

3418
03:20:29,660 --> 03:20:31,240
Oh my god, that scared me.

3419
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:36,300
You know what?

3420
03:20:36,300 --> 03:20:36,980
We can save over.

3421
03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:37,540
It's fine.

3422
03:20:40,600 --> 03:20:41,800
The grenade.

3423
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:42,520
It's fine.

3424
03:20:48,620 --> 03:20:49,220
It's fine.

3425
03:20:49,980 --> 03:20:50,800
Is she still in here?

3426
03:20:54,960 --> 03:20:55,560
She is.

3427
03:20:58,560 --> 03:20:59,160
Okay.

3428
03:21:00,740 --> 03:21:14,300
it's the same dialogue as before playing this game our
resident theme park expert is like actually okay let's see

3429
03:21:16,060 --> 03:21:25,880
so now I think that should allow us to go to the water area
we still have a thing in the dungeon to do we still have a

3430
03:21:25,880 --> 03:21:31,180
thing in the theater to do one second I'm I got

3431
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:44,440
some new contacts lately, and I don't think my eyes like
them, so I will not be using them again.

3432
03:21:50,430 --> 03:21:50,830
Um...

3433
03:21:52,890 --> 03:21:54,050
The east side of the park.

3434
03:21:54,310 --> 03:21:55,310
I'm pretty far into the game.

3435
03:21:55,390 --> 03:21:56,190
No way, really?

3436
03:21:57,050 --> 03:21:57,670
Let's go.

3437
03:21:59,470 --> 03:22:00,590
Looks like it with how you've been...

3438
03:22:00,590 --> 03:22:01,910
Have I been squinting a lot?

3439
03:22:02,070 --> 03:22:02,750
I'm sorry.

3440
03:22:06,730 --> 03:22:07,290
Let's see.

3441
03:22:07,410 --> 03:22:08,230
Okay, I'm gonna...

3442
03:22:08,250 --> 03:22:27,170
read the things again this okay they were like hey I need um
uh cute little house okay we went in there um we did that

3443
03:22:27,170 --> 03:22:37,110
ocean kingdom restaurant trident without it we can't do the
birthday scene monster song so we okay so we got it yeah

3444
03:22:37,110 --> 03:22:43,330
find the crank handle we got dog egg in the system the
eggies are going missing with the dog we got to find the

3445
03:22:43,330 --> 03:22:53,890
come the security discs do ghosts need glasses yeah I mean I
died needing glasses so it's like the same exact I don't

3446
03:22:53,890 --> 03:23:06,990
just magically fix my prescription when I'm a ghost sadly
it's just you know kind of like you know you know how like

3447
03:23:06,990 --> 03:23:13,430
when someone dies in a great pain they come back as a ghost
and there's you hear them like you know you'll hear that

3448
03:23:13,430 --> 03:23:20,730
like the ghost stories being like and you hear him wailing
because he's reliving his pain like that except i'm not in

3449
03:23:20,730 --> 03:23:26,250
pain well sometimes but i'm just wailing because my eyes are
dry

3450
03:23:29,390 --> 03:23:32,310
same thing just mine's a little less dramatic

3451
03:23:39,470 --> 03:23:47,110
you don't want to be a ghost you guys it's overrated you can
die i mean you will eventually sorry to remind you of your

3452
03:23:47,110 --> 03:23:59,110
looming you know mortality but but you know um don't become
a ghost just like you know move onwards so your unfinished

3453
03:23:59,110 --> 03:24:02,350
business is not being able to see it could be

3454
03:24:07,640 --> 03:24:15,260
will you be there to greet us what do you who do you think i
am mori calliope i'm no grim reaper i'm like the bottom of

3455
03:24:15,260 --> 03:24:15,860
the barrel.

3456
03:24:16,360 --> 03:24:17,540
I'm a phantom.

3457
03:24:18,240 --> 03:24:20,840
I'm just a spirit out here.

3458
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:30,980
I'm like on the lowest of the totem pole here.

3459
03:24:33,280 --> 03:24:33,920
Maybe.

3460
03:24:36,220 --> 03:24:39,740
If I become so consumed with rage, I could become a demon.

3461
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:46,260
to play more rage games.

3462
03:24:50,200 --> 03:24:51,080
The books.

3463
03:24:53,600 --> 03:24:57,280
Okay, if you're doing maintenance in the haunted manor and
trying to access Ocean Kingdom, you'll need the crank

3464
03:24:57,280 --> 03:24:57,740
handle.

3465
03:25:00,960 --> 03:25:01,660
Ocean Kingdom.

3466
03:25:01,880 --> 03:25:03,300
So that's where we're trying to go, right?

3467
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:08,640
Depiction of alcohol in the mermaid cage.

3468
03:25:10,760 --> 03:25:11,720
It's not an alcohol bottle.

3469
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:13,520
It's a bottle of highly corrosive acid.

3470
03:25:16,400 --> 03:25:20,560
Power switch for the four periphery elevators is in
Tollman's office.

3471
03:25:21,900 --> 03:25:23,240
Okay, so the other...

3472
03:25:23,240 --> 03:25:25,240
Okay, that's what it means by the other side of the park.

3473
03:25:25,500 --> 03:25:25,860
Okay, cool.

3474
03:25:26,580 --> 03:25:27,740
Piano is a haunted...

3475
03:25:27,740 --> 03:25:28,060
Yeah.

3476
03:25:28,740 --> 03:25:31,400
I'm just going through all the things.

3477
03:25:32,760 --> 03:25:34,100
Clocks need regular winding.

3478
03:25:35,400 --> 03:25:36,740
Man, button behind the panel.

3479
03:25:37,220 --> 03:25:38,260
Yeah, the crow house.

3480
03:25:38,380 --> 03:25:39,240
Yeah, we did that.

3481
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:44,680
Crow moved the electric battery charger to the southeast
underground there.

3482
03:25:47,400 --> 03:25:57,240
falling doors are now locked electronically yeah oh we can
get into the ophelia crypt if we can open it oh i did not

3483
03:25:57,240 --> 03:26:07,500
realize that okay i forgot about that actually that we had
read that earlier okay how many dang memos are there um this

3484
03:26:07,500 --> 03:26:17,100
could be an email varnish the ocean kingdom storage room
door i think we can shoot that Seven Seas, Mermaids use the

3485
03:26:17,100 --> 03:26:18,300
same kind of battery as the giant crow.

3486
03:26:18,440 --> 03:26:23,340
So I think we have to take the battery from them to them
give it to the crow.

3487
03:26:25,480 --> 03:26:27,740
Oh, we jumped from 25 to 34, though.

3488
03:26:33,700 --> 03:26:34,360
What was this?

3489
03:26:34,800 --> 03:26:35,400
Oh, the trap.

3490
03:26:35,560 --> 03:26:35,860
Yeah, yeah.

3491
03:26:35,980 --> 03:26:36,120
Okay.

3492
03:26:37,660 --> 03:26:38,020
Okay.

3493
03:26:38,360 --> 03:26:46,360
I think we can now go to the ocean area, I suppose, it
seems.

3494
03:26:50,190 --> 03:26:51,970
Why do I still have this thing?

3495
03:26:54,590 --> 03:26:55,030
Huh.

3496
03:26:55,390 --> 03:26:56,950
Oh, no email in 1980.

3497
03:26:57,310 --> 03:26:57,650
You know what?

3498
03:26:57,690 --> 03:26:58,390
You're so right.

3499
03:27:00,910 --> 03:27:01,750
You're so right.

3500
03:27:04,830 --> 03:27:05,270
Hayden!

3501
03:27:05,650 --> 03:27:06,490
Oh my gosh!

3502
03:27:06,690 --> 03:27:08,030
Thank you so much for the tank, Hampton!

3503
03:27:08,350 --> 03:27:09,070
Thank you!

3504
03:27:10,010 --> 03:27:12,430
Oh, yeah, I'm so nimble.

3505
03:27:15,750 --> 03:27:17,050
Oh, come on.

3506
03:27:17,330 --> 03:27:18,210
Where did you come from?

3507
03:27:19,190 --> 03:27:19,950
Ah, yeah, blah, blah.

3508
03:27:20,130 --> 03:27:21,450
What was that?

3509
03:27:27,880 --> 03:27:28,360
What?

3510
03:27:28,600 --> 03:27:29,120
Doesn't work?

3511
03:27:29,300 --> 03:27:29,680
The crank?

3512
03:27:38,300 --> 03:27:38,660
Oh.

3513
03:27:40,720 --> 03:27:42,060
This is terrible.

3514
03:27:44,880 --> 03:27:46,400
Oh, it's a good thing there's nobody here.

3515
03:27:46,660 --> 03:27:47,120
AAAAAAAA!

3516
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:48,460
Go, go!

3517
03:28:08,020 --> 03:28:09,120
So it can.

3518
03:28:10,400 --> 03:28:12,540
This place is wild!

3519
03:28:15,320 --> 03:28:18,100
Why are the crows trying to kill me all of a sudden?

3520
03:28:19,820 --> 03:28:21,120
Storage staff only.

3521
03:28:21,460 --> 03:28:22,120
Handle is broken.

3522
03:28:23,240 --> 03:28:24,000
Won't budge.

3523
03:28:24,180 --> 03:28:25,450
Can't think of any way to open it.

3524
03:28:27,120 --> 03:28:27,840
Oh, we don't have a...

3525
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:29,120
That's right, we don't have a...

3526
03:28:31,800 --> 03:28:32,640
Thing yet.

3527
03:28:34,520 --> 03:28:35,340
A map.

3528
03:28:36,440 --> 03:28:38,060
Was what the words I'm drawing to say.

3529
03:28:38,440 --> 03:28:39,560
Why is there a crow in here?

3530
03:28:39,620 --> 03:28:40,420
Are we not indoors?

3531
03:28:43,280 --> 03:28:44,060
The sub!

3532
03:28:45,220 --> 03:28:45,600
Okay.

3533
03:28:47,400 --> 03:28:47,820
This...

3534
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:49,960
Stop it!

3535
03:28:50,880 --> 03:28:53,120
Don't let the door hit you on the way out!

3536
03:28:55,720 --> 03:28:56,980
For real though.

3537
03:29:02,990 --> 03:29:03,970
This place is crazy.

3538
03:29:04,830 --> 03:29:05,470
Trash can.

3539
03:29:07,330 --> 03:29:08,170
Soda can.

3540
03:29:09,410 --> 03:29:12,070
We haven't gotten anything from the trash cans in a bit, I
feel.

3541
03:29:12,930 --> 03:29:13,530
Not just me.

3542
03:29:19,130 --> 03:29:20,350
Why are there birds in here?

3543
03:29:22,290 --> 03:29:25,610
I noticed the acid bottle in the mermaid cage is pretty much
empty.

3544
03:29:26,370 --> 03:29:31,870
fill it from the acid tank but I heard Crow moved it down to
the underground level and no I don't know what he's using it

3545
03:29:31,870 --> 03:29:33,750
for I didn't ask

3546
03:29:37,280 --> 03:29:39,780

03:30:32,770 --> 03:30:33,750
Oh, a map!

3552
03:30:36,580 --> 03:30:36,800
Bee!

3553
03:30:37,220 --> 03:30:39,160
How many parts of the theme park are there?

3554
03:30:39,640 --> 03:30:44,540
There's three, and then like the other smaller areas, right?

3555
03:30:44,660 --> 03:30:45,380
Is that what it was?

3556
03:30:46,980 --> 03:30:48,500
Because we don't have cosmic future.

3557
03:30:51,260 --> 03:30:52,660
Destroy your lungs, Queen.

3558
03:31:01,610 --> 03:31:03,230
The Seven Seas.

3559
03:31:03,530 --> 03:31:04,490
It's a gas vent.

3560
03:31:04,990 --> 03:31:07,090
Fumes are flowing up from a vent in the ground.

3561
03:31:07,430 --> 03:31:08,070
Smells awful.

3562
03:31:09,430 --> 03:31:10,650
I don't want to go anywhere near it.

3563
03:31:10,750 --> 03:31:11,650
Wait, what is this?

3564
03:31:12,870 --> 03:31:14,810
It's a bottle containing an antidote.

3565
03:31:16,290 --> 03:31:17,070
Okay, look at that.

3566
03:31:17,310 --> 03:31:18,070
Sunk in treasure.

3567
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:25,860
In arcade.

3568
03:31:29,360 --> 03:31:31,540
I want to find a save point first.

3569
03:31:33,180 --> 03:31:34,580
Before we do that.

3570
03:31:36,240 --> 03:31:37,240
Oh, come on!

3571
03:31:37,400 --> 03:31:38,100
What the hell?

3572
03:31:38,320 --> 03:31:39,620
How did you guys get here so fast?

3573
03:31:42,800 --> 03:31:44,740
Let's try the submarine.

3574
03:31:45,980 --> 03:31:47,000
Surely it's safe in here.

3575
03:31:47,320 --> 03:31:47,580
Yeah!

3576
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:51,060
Okay.

3577
03:31:51,980 --> 03:31:52,960
We're good now.

3578
03:31:55,980 --> 03:31:56,240
Nice.

3579
03:31:57,260 --> 03:31:58,420
What else is in here?

3580
03:31:59,880 --> 03:32:00,260
Hey, Ed.

3583
03:32:02,040 --> 03:32:03,260
Systems all up and running.

3584
03:32:03,500 --> 03:32:04,260
And the important part?

3585
03:32:04,560 --> 03:32:07,420
I've lined up a major buyer for the gold.

3586
03:32:08,280 --> 03:32:10,980
Is this Playmobile Resident Evil?

3587
03:32:12,140 --> 03:32:12,600
Yes.

3588
03:32:12,720 --> 03:32:13,420
actually

3589
03:32:17,850 --> 03:32:23,630
I had to put on a bit of a show while they visited the site
but I think I got away with it I had a thought about the

3590
03:32:23,630 --> 03:32:30,670
rocks you're using for the ore do you think anyone over on
my end would be able to tell it's not Brazilian like they

3591
03:32:30,670 --> 03:32:41,650
know it was from Georgia maybe I'm overthinking it I think
so I think they could tell that the rocks are from Georgia

3592
03:32:49,050 --> 03:32:56,870
I think they would be able to tell So I wonder if the So the
stuff they've been mining Is like this gold ore That they've

3593
03:32:56,870 --> 03:32:58,570
been digging up, right?

3594
03:32:59,310 --> 03:33:06,810

The personal effects of Captain Nemo!

3600
03:33:22,670 --> 03:33:23,910
Don't bullshit me.

3601
03:33:25,210 --> 03:33:26,350
Come on, it won't budge.

3602
03:33:26,470 --> 03:33:27,750
Maybe there's a different way to open it.

3603
03:33:27,850 --> 03:33:28,670
This button here?

3604
03:33:29,550 --> 03:33:30,370
Rules of the sea.

3605
03:33:32,450 --> 03:33:32,930
Octopus?

3606
03:33:34,210 --> 03:33:36,570
Wait, press the red button to reset your score.

3607
03:33:39,650 --> 03:33:41,630
Oh, shark, shark, shark!

3608
03:33:41,650 --> 03:33:42,710
Wait.

3609
03:33:44,110 --> 03:33:45,910
Shark, shark, shark, shark, shark, dolphin.

3610
03:33:47,250 --> 03:33:48,310
Are they zombie rocks?

3611
03:33:48,390 --> 03:33:49,630
Because that's a dead giveaway.

3612
03:33:54,860 --> 03:33:57,280
We gotta do shark, shark, shark, shark.

3613
03:33:59,760 --> 03:34:00,840
I remember.

3614
03:34:01,780 --> 03:34:03,100
It's not displaying anything.

3615
03:34:06,820 --> 03:34:07,460
Nothing.

3616
03:34:08,180 --> 03:34:08,820
What about this one?

3617
03:34:09,260 --> 03:34:09,860
It's broken.

3618
03:34:11,140 --> 03:34:13,520
Oh, do I have to use my own bullets for this?

3619
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:14,500
Alright.

3620
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:15,420
Shark.

3621
03:34:15,920 --> 03:34:17,820
Four sharks and dolphin, I think.

3622
03:34:18,400 --> 03:34:19,260
One, two, three.

3623
03:34:19,360 --> 03:34:22,220
Okay, shoot the shark four times and then the dolphin.

3624
03:34:25,920 --> 03:34:26,900
Uh-oh.

3625
03:34:27,860 --> 03:34:29,320
If he'll come back down.

3626
03:34:30,940 --> 03:34:31,460
One.

3627
03:34:38,400 --> 03:34:40,760
I think the toidal got on the way.

3628
03:34:42,820 --> 03:34:43,460
One.

3629
03:34:44,860 --> 03:34:45,380
Two.

3630
03:34:51,580 --> 03:34:52,080
Hold.

3631
03:34:53,100 --> 03:34:53,580
Hold.

3632
03:34:53,840 --> 03:34:54,120
Hold!

3633
03:34:58,180 --> 03:34:58,840
Uh...

3634
03:34:58,840 --> 03:34:59,540
Oh.

3635
03:35:01,660 --> 03:35:02,320
Three!

3636
03:35:03,440 --> 03:35:04,100
Four!

3637
03:35:05,260 --> 03:35:05,980
And then the dolphin.

3638
03:35:09,100 --> 03:35:09,920
Uh, where's my...

3639
03:35:09,920 --> 03:35:11,240
Where's my... Oh, there it is.

3640
03:35:11,800 --> 03:35:13,980
Uh, uh, I don't trust it.

3641
03:35:14,060 --> 03:35:14,540
I can't see.

3642
03:35:16,420 --> 03:35:18,100
Uh, oh gosh.

3643
03:35:18,560 --> 03:35:19,360
Oh my god.

3644
03:35:19,980 --> 03:35:20,400
Hold!

3645
03:35:21,480 --> 03:35:22,140
Hold!

3646
03:35:23,840 --> 03:35:25,020
It's like that game friend.

3647
03:35:27,560 --> 03:35:27,780
Oh, wait.

3648
03:35:27,860 --> 03:35:28,340
Oh, my gosh.

3649
03:35:28,980 --> 03:35:29,680
Oh, oops.

3650
03:35:29,920 --> 03:35:30,320
It's fine.

3651
03:35:30,620 --> 03:35:31,060
We're fine.

3652
03:35:32,620 --> 03:35:33,000
Yay!

3653
03:35:33,680 --> 03:35:34,680
Shotty time.

3654
03:35:35,560 --> 03:35:37,300
There's a bunch of nautical trinkets in here.

3655
03:35:37,520 --> 03:35:38,020
And a shotgun.

3656
03:35:38,380 --> 03:35:39,520
It looks like a real one.

3657
03:35:41,220 --> 03:35:42,140
Oh, my gosh.

3658
03:35:42,200 --> 03:35:43,620
We got the shotgun!

3659
03:35:52,310 --> 03:35:54,210
Oh, it's showing the...

3660
03:35:54,210 --> 03:35:55,630
Some information about dolphins.

3661
03:35:56,710 --> 03:35:57,950
Bottle knows dolphins way.

3662
03:35:58,090 --> 03:36:00,210
An average of 660 pounds.

3663
03:36:01,070 --> 03:36:03,330
They can reach a length of 4 meters or 13 feet.

3664
03:36:04,110 --> 03:36:05,570
They can live for more than 40 years.

3665
03:36:06,150 --> 03:36:10,310
And finally, they can jump at a height of 20 feet up in the
air.

3666
03:36:11,090 --> 03:36:13,510
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

3667
03:36:19,850 --> 03:36:23,370
Okay, so I switch weapons.

3668
03:36:24,170 --> 03:36:24,630
How?

3669
03:36:25,930 --> 03:36:27,230
Like, oh.

3670
03:36:30,570 --> 03:36:31,170
Oh.

3671
03:36:33,130 --> 03:36:36,910
We'll stick with the handgun for now, though, since it's
what I'm used to.

3672
03:36:38,710 --> 03:36:39,050
All right.

3673
03:36:39,830 --> 03:36:40,910
Anything else in here?

3674
03:36:41,890 --> 03:36:42,990
I think we're good for now.

3675
03:36:44,130 --> 03:36:46,470
Let's go into that really horrible arcade.

3676
03:36:57,290 --> 03:36:58,330
Big boy.

3677
03:37:02,250 --> 03:37:03,310
Guys, I'm scared.

3678
03:37:04,770 --> 03:37:05,930
Guys, it's so...

3679
03:37:05,930 --> 03:37:07,410
Oh, there's a person over there!

3680
03:37:08,790 --> 03:37:09,670
Holy cow!

3681
03:37:12,270 --> 03:37:15,090
Q scared me so much.

3682
03:37:16,990 --> 03:37:18,210
Can't carry anymore.

3683
03:37:19,650 --> 03:37:20,530
No power.

3684
03:37:20,770 --> 03:37:21,430
What's to say?

3685
03:37:22,150 --> 03:37:25,250
Some of the kids were complaining that their high scores
weren't being saved.

3686
03:37:26,650 --> 03:37:29,130
I guess the machines reset their scores every time we turn
them off?

3687
03:37:29,350 --> 03:37:30,610
I don't know if that's supposed to happen.

3688
03:37:31,050 --> 03:37:32,250
But I'm not going to fix it.

3689
03:37:32,350 --> 03:37:34,330
It gives the kids a reason to keep coming back.

3690
03:37:34,690 --> 03:37:35,290
What the damn?

3691
03:37:37,930 --> 03:37:49,370
app girl looking pretty cute no power on any of these things
okay it's not that big of a room guys we're okay maybe

3692
03:37:49,370 --> 03:37:53,050
control box it's silver keyhole okay

3693
03:37:57,830 --> 03:38:06,930
claw machine out of order there's second note behind it what
on earth set the arcade game scores dolphin score should be

3694
03:38:06,930 --> 03:38:09,750
twice the mermaid Both score should be twice the dolphin
score.

3695
03:38:09,990 --> 03:38:11,970
Shark score should be twice...

3696
03:38:11,970 --> 03:38:16,850
I take a photo?

3697
03:38:18,790 --> 03:38:20,070
What does that mean?

3698
03:38:20,510 --> 03:38:21,530
Some kind of equation.

3699
03:38:22,190 --> 03:38:23,370
Please, game, I'm stupid.

3700
03:38:23,590 --> 03:38:24,750
You have to understand.

3701
03:38:26,330 --> 03:38:27,330
The Atlantic Globe.

3702
03:38:27,750 --> 03:38:28,950
August 1988.

3703
03:38:29,370 --> 03:38:31,730
Crow Country announces sudden closure.

3704
03:38:32,530 --> 03:38:37,350
While its popularity has been on something of a downturn
recently, it's so shady.

3705
03:38:39,470 --> 03:38:44,550
There were no public signs of an impending closure for local
theme park Crow Country.

3706
03:38:45,330 --> 03:38:50,370
However many angry guests were forcefully turned away as
they showed up to the park yesterday, only to find the gates

3707
03:38:50,370 --> 03:38:51,070
closed.

3708
03:38:51,870 --> 03:38:57,550
Speculation is rife that this sudden decision has something
to do with the Elaine Marshall incident reported in this

3709
03:38:57,550 --> 03:38:59,010
newspaper two weeks ago.

3710
03:38:59,730 --> 03:39:01,030
You heard it here first, folks.

3711
03:39:01,350 --> 03:39:03,290
In our newspaper two weeks ago.

3712
03:39:10,410 --> 03:39:17,290
statement it has nothing to do with the marshal incident
we're just closing for refurbishments but that doesn't line

3713
03:39:17,290 --> 03:39:28,430
up with the fact that people had tickets booked for a visit
to the park this week what's going on mr crow breaking news

3714
03:39:28,430 --> 03:39:29,310
breaking news

Could you not point that light in my face?

3718
03:39:47,380 --> 03:39:50,260
Oh my god, he actually, like, is blinded.

3719
03:39:51,320 --> 03:39:53,300
I've got a wicked headache as it is.

3720
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:55,160
Who are you?

3721
03:39:55,640 --> 03:39:56,640
Never seen you before.

3722
03:39:58,300 --> 03:39:59,020
I'm Mara.

3723
03:39:59,980 --> 03:40:03,380

says press in her hat.

3724
03:40:03,880 --> 03:40:03,900
Yeah.

3725
03:40:09,620 --> 03:40:11,080

03:40:44,460 --> 03:40:50,560
I mean, could we not tell that he has done something because
there are monsters all over the park?

3731
03:40:54,790 --> 03:40:57,410
Have you guys also noticed that there's no rides here?

3732
03:40:59,070 --> 03:41:01,730
What is this park without any rides?

3733
03:41:03,110 --> 03:41:03,470
Nothing.

3734
03:41:06,890 --> 03:41:07,350
Suspicious.

3735
03:41:09,890 --> 03:41:10,350
Partners?

3736
03:41:10,590 --> 03:41:11,910
Which one of them cooks?

3737
03:41:14,790 --> 03:41:16,130
Yeah, it's all themed.

3738
03:41:16,410 --> 03:41:17,030
They'll ride.

3739
03:41:20,150 --> 03:41:22,210
The sub is a ride, maybe.

3740
03:41:26,090 --> 03:41:27,130
Hey, so how old are you?

3741
03:41:27,450 --> 03:41:28,110
Old enough.

Nice gun, by the way.

3743
03:41:31,090 --> 03:41:31,450
What is that?

3744
03:41:31,510 --> 03:41:32,050
A browning?

3745
03:41:32,210 --> 03:41:32,550
A cult?

3746
03:41:33,050 --> 03:41:33,910
Uh, yeah, sure.

3747
03:41:34,810 --> 03:41:36,390
Marvin, what kind of work do you do with Crow?

3748
03:41:36,970 --> 03:41:38,530
I work overseas normally.

3749
03:41:39,170 --> 03:41:40,510
Just came back for a little visit.

3750
03:41:43,090 --> 03:41:57,130
been to the southern hemisphere perhaps only crows gone and
disappeared great timing it's a lot like enchanted forest in

3751
03:41:57,130 --> 03:42:03,290
Oregon where there's only like two or three rides don't get
me wrong I do love me an amusement park that doesn't have

3752
03:42:03,290 --> 03:42:10,830
that you know that doesn't I don't I don't need to go to an
amusement or theme park rather and it have to have rides but

3753
03:42:10,830 --> 03:42:23,030
I'm also just kind of like what are do here we had a theater
we had the duck thing the haunted manor you have the the

3754
03:42:23,030 --> 03:42:36,110
crypt where you only what like one person can go in at a
time and solve the puzzle it's just anyway pretty sure he's

3755
03:42:36,110 --> 03:42:43,490
around here somewhere see I wanted to use the northwest
elevator, but Tollman's prowling around back there.

3756
03:42:44,070 --> 03:42:44,550
Tollman?

3757
03:42:45,210 --> 03:42:47,830
Yeah, you know, Ed's root excavation guy.

3758
03:42:48,470 --> 03:42:49,030
Root, what?

3759
03:42:49,770 --> 03:42:51,490
Maybe I'll try the southwest elevator.

3760
03:42:51,770 --> 03:42:52,290
That could work.

3761
03:42:52,970 --> 03:42:54,530
Wait, the elevators are broken, aren't they?

3762
03:42:55,130 --> 03:42:56,130
Ha, that depends.

3763
03:42:56,590 --> 03:42:57,050
On what?

3764
03:42:57,530 --> 03:42:59,430
Yeah, I think I'd get, I'd better get going.

3765
03:42:59,870 --> 03:43:00,810
See you around, Mary.

3766
03:43:04,970 --> 03:43:06,530
So Tollman's back there?

3767
03:43:08,630 --> 03:43:10,370
Right now, we're in the games arcade.

3768
03:43:10,750 --> 03:43:11,110
Okay.

3769
03:43:14,620 --> 03:43:17,260
I mean, we've gone through everything that we could so far.

3770
03:43:17,480 --> 03:43:19,380
We just got to go forward, I suppose.

3771
03:43:21,980 --> 03:43:23,060
The backrooms!

3772
03:43:27,600 --> 03:43:29,160
This is the actual backrooms!

3773
03:43:33,840 --> 03:43:34,800
It's a photo?

3774
03:43:35,920 --> 03:43:36,220
Ooh!

3775
03:43:36,500 --> 03:43:37,760
Oh, she's the captain!

3776
03:43:45,610 --> 03:43:46,470
The phone.

3777
03:43:47,110 --> 03:43:47,990
Large wooden crate.

3778
03:43:49,930 --> 03:44:02,810
there open the gate i think we're good where's the phone at
oh here oh my god that thing almost got me look there's the

worst part is i never really wanted the gold i didn't really

3780
03:44:13,690 --> 03:44:22,370
care is this walter white it was my father who He made the
decision to buy the land.

3781
03:44:23,510 --> 03:44:24,510
Can't you shoot those boxes?

3782
03:44:24,730 --> 03:44:28,390
Yeah, but I want to see if I need to.

3783
03:44:29,310 --> 03:44:34,290
Or rather, I'm conserving my bullets.

3784
03:44:36,070 --> 03:44:39,510
Years later, when he died, he left all of Crow Country and
my care.

3785
03:44:40,030 --> 03:44:41,390
I had no choice but to come back.

3786
03:44:41,770 --> 03:44:42,770
Finish what he'd started.

3787
03:44:44,470 --> 03:44:46,610
Wait, the theme park originally belonged to your father?

3788
03:44:47,870 --> 03:44:49,910
No, that's the guy that stole the sunken tree.

3789
03:44:49,930 --> 03:44:53,770
My treasure from the fish and the amazing digital circus.

3790
03:44:55,430 --> 03:44:59,710
My treasure, my treasure, my life savings.

3791
03:45:08,750 --> 03:45:11,710
No, Crow Country is the name of the land, this land.

3792
03:45:13,690 --> 03:45:14,550
Just hung up.

3793
03:45:17,630 --> 03:45:18,930
Well now we have a shortcut.

3794
03:45:19,870 --> 03:45:23,510
Hold on, I'm gonna grab this map real quick.

3795
03:45:23,530 --> 03:45:25,150
Western utility corridors.

3796
03:45:25,330 --> 03:45:26,270
Okay, cool.

3797
03:45:27,390 --> 03:45:28,410
What we got here?

3798
03:45:30,490 --> 03:45:31,330
Staff hallway.

3799
03:45:32,230 --> 03:45:33,090
Look at that, you guys.

3800
03:45:33,190 --> 03:45:34,910
We've almost filled out the map, I feel.

3801
03:45:35,670 --> 03:45:36,630
Pretty cool.

3802
03:45:38,430 --> 03:45:40,430
Delivery garage down there, huh?

3803
03:45:41,530 --> 03:45:41,970
Okay.

3804
03:45:42,570 --> 03:45:42,910
Lounge?

3805
03:45:43,090 --> 03:45:43,970
What's the lounge?

3806
03:45:46,470 --> 03:45:47,650
Oh, Crow's lounge.

3807
03:45:50,010 --> 03:45:51,010
It won't budge.

3808
03:45:51,150 --> 03:45:51,890
There's no keyhole either.

3809
03:45:52,010 --> 03:45:53,070
There's a sign, but it's blank.

3810
03:45:53,890 --> 03:45:54,790
Kick the door!

3811
03:45:58,520 --> 03:45:58,640
Oh!

3812
03:45:59,080 --> 03:46:00,160
The sign dropped down.

3813
03:46:01,080 --> 03:46:03,780
Let the record show that I solved my problem with violence.

3814
03:46:05,180 --> 03:46:05,720
Silver keyhole.

3815
03:46:05,820 --> 03:46:07,540
Okay, we still don't have a silver key yet.

3816
03:46:08,900 --> 03:46:09,660
But, uh, wait.

3817
03:46:11,260 --> 03:46:12,880
It was, uh, over here, right?

3818
03:46:13,160 --> 03:46:14,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this part.

3819
03:46:16,400 --> 03:46:16,800
This...

3820
03:46:18,660 --> 03:46:19,780
Is now a shortcut!

3821
03:46:20,680 --> 03:46:21,220
Look at that!

3822
03:46:24,040 --> 03:46:24,440
Grenade.

3823
03:46:26,540 --> 03:46:27,100
Granade.

3824
03:46:28,400 --> 03:46:28,700
Can I?

3825
03:46:30,320 --> 03:46:30,740
You.

3826
03:46:31,240 --> 03:46:32,180
You sucker.

3827
03:46:32,620 --> 03:46:33,820
Don't turn your head on me.

3828
03:46:34,520 --> 03:46:36,700
There's so many poison things on the ground now.

3829
03:46:40,580 --> 03:46:42,220
I will disable this, at least.

3830
03:46:43,400 --> 03:46:44,100
Oh my god.

3831
03:46:44,220 --> 03:46:46,100
I just noticed the one on the ceiling, too.

3832
03:46:46,900 --> 03:46:47,700
No way.

3833
03:46:48,240 --> 03:46:49,380
They're evil.

3834
03:46:49,660 --> 03:46:50,200
They're evil.

3835
03:46:53,200 --> 03:46:53,760
Oh,

3836
03:47:00,900 --> 03:47:01,640
I thought something...

3837
03:47:01,740 --> 03:47:02,820
I thought I saw something there.

3838
03:47:05,180 --> 03:47:05,600
Alright, let's see.

3839
03:47:05,700 --> 03:47:06,840
What's our ammo look?

3840
03:47:06,920 --> 03:47:08,060
Oh, yeah, we got plenty.

3841
03:47:11,980 --> 03:47:13,040
Oh, yeah.

3842
03:47:14,000 --> 03:47:15,640
I can't carry anymore now.

3843
03:47:15,800 --> 03:47:16,780
Oh, my gosh.

3844
03:47:19,480 --> 03:47:20,680
I'm too...

3845
03:47:20,680 --> 03:47:21,300
I'm too...

3846
03:47:21,300 --> 03:47:22,720
I don't find enough things, maybe.

3847
03:47:24,420 --> 03:47:24,760
Okay.

3848
03:47:25,440 --> 03:47:27,520
So, staff hallway.

3849
03:47:28,400 --> 03:47:29,520
Crow's lounge.

3850
03:47:31,120 --> 03:47:31,720
Game.

3851
03:47:31,740 --> 03:47:38,320
our kid let's go to the lounge oh

3852
03:47:42,180 --> 03:47:56,310
I'm in the wall wait someone's in here wooden panel I can
see it through into the lounge Harrison James is sitting on

3853
03:47:56,310 --> 03:48:04,450
the couch he doesn't notice me this is kind of Mara is a
voyeur she said this is That's kind of fun.

3854
03:48:07,290 --> 03:48:08,470
Okay, that's enough of that.

3855
03:48:10,350 --> 03:48:13,470
The root excavation areas need to stay locked when you're
not using them.

3856
03:48:13,830 --> 03:48:17,310
If you need to access them, the switch that unlocks all the
gates is in the break room.

3857
03:48:17,530 --> 03:48:18,950
That's in the northwest area.

3858
03:48:20,150 --> 03:48:21,630
Northwest underground area.

3859
03:48:25,530 --> 03:48:25,710
Oh!

3860
03:48:28,310 --> 03:48:28,750
Wait.

3861
03:48:29,490 --> 03:48:29,890
Close.

3862
03:48:30,810 --> 03:48:31,250
What?

3863
03:48:32,290 --> 03:48:32,510
What?

3864
03:48:32,530 --> 03:48:32,910
What's over here?

3865
03:48:33,130 --> 03:48:33,430
What?

3866
03:48:33,650 --> 03:48:38,190
I have not finished my explorations.

3867
03:48:38,690 --> 03:48:39,610
Apple Corps.

3868
03:48:41,190 --> 03:48:42,530
What is this?

3869
03:48:44,090 --> 03:48:44,770
Oh my god.

3870
03:48:44,890 --> 03:48:45,910
Wait, there's a diagram!

3871
03:48:46,610 --> 03:48:48,090
Wait, this might be better for me, no?

3872
03:48:49,490 --> 03:48:50,650
Dude still didn't notice.

3873
03:48:50,870 --> 03:48:54,310
He has the survival skills of a rock.

3874
03:48:57,430 --> 03:48:58,270
Handwritten letter.

3875
03:48:58,490 --> 03:48:58,870
Hey, Ed.

3876
03:48:59,050 --> 03:48:59,470
What's up?

3877
03:49:00,650 --> 03:49:02,710
The mine has an inspection coming up.

3878
03:49:02,850 --> 03:49:03,630
National level.

3879
03:49:03,650 --> 03:49:12,690
scary shit I think I think these uh wait Marv yeah these
okay I thought that the letters were from Marv okay yeah

3880
03:49:12,690 --> 03:49:18,230
being maxed out on ammo in a survival horror game means
you're doing great I'm glad you're enjoying yeah I'm having

3881
03:49:18,230 --> 03:49:24,670
fun thank you someone told me they check the actual minerals
in the ore like they check it's if it's a match for the

3882
03:49:24,670 --> 03:49:30,750
local area then someone else told me they don't ever do that
but they will with me because they definitely suspect

3883
03:49:30,750 --> 03:49:35,010
something so I had to create so I had to create of rocks and
soil delivered.

3884
03:49:35,390 --> 03:49:36,530
Let me know when it gets to you.

3885
03:49:36,930 --> 03:49:42,090
I got the contents for free, obviously, but it costs an
absolute freaking fortune to send something so heavy.

3886
03:49:42,530 --> 03:49:45,350
But if it means we can fool the inspection, guys...

3887
03:49:45,350 --> 03:49:45,810
Marv.

3888
03:49:48,940 --> 03:49:51,280
They're doing illegal activities.

3889
03:49:54,880 --> 03:49:55,340
Hello.

3890
03:49:57,060 --> 03:49:57,520
Hi.

3891
03:49:58,360 --> 03:49:59,160
Well, well.

3892
03:49:59,280 --> 03:50:00,120
Look who it is.

3893
03:50:00,700 --> 03:50:02,800
Mara, you told me you were on your way out.

3894
03:50:03,500 --> 03:50:04,300
I got lost.

3895
03:50:06,120 --> 03:50:07,860
I'm not stupid, you know.

3896
03:50:08,520 --> 03:50:09,220
Did you find Natalie?

3897
03:50:09,860 --> 03:50:10,600
No, not yet.

3898
03:50:11,260 --> 03:50:13,460
I thought she might be in here, but...

3899
03:50:13,460 --> 03:50:14,080
What are you reading?

3900
03:50:14,680 --> 03:50:16,220
It's an old book about gold mining.

3901
03:50:16,460 --> 03:50:17,600
It's actually really...

3902
03:50:17,600 --> 03:50:18,240
Looks boring.

3903
03:50:22,790 --> 03:50:24,490
The music is so, like, whimsical.

3904
03:50:24,930 --> 03:50:25,510
It's so cute.

3905
03:50:26,650 --> 03:50:28,350
Mara, is there something I can help you with?

3906
03:50:29,550 --> 03:50:30,670
How are you feeling?

3907
03:50:31,470 --> 03:50:31,970
What do you mean?

3908
03:50:32,750 --> 03:50:33,550
You're not injured?

3909
03:50:34,270 --> 03:50:35,830
You haven't been attacked by anything?

3910
03:50:37,730 --> 03:50:38,270
them too.

3911
03:50:39,810 --> 03:50:40,510
Those creatures.

3912
03:50:41,450 --> 03:50:42,270
Did they attack you?

3913
03:50:42,830 --> 03:50:43,530
No, I ran.

3914
03:50:43,930 --> 03:50:44,690
Fast as I could.

3915
03:50:45,350 --> 03:50:46,410
I thought I was going crazy.

3916
03:50:47,510 --> 03:50:48,450
Mara, what are they?

3917
03:50:49,070 --> 03:50:49,750
What's going on here?

3918
03:50:49,830 --> 03:50:50,470
Do you know something?

3919
03:50:51,210 --> 03:50:52,450
Theme of Hymbo.

3920
03:50:58,660 --> 03:51:00,100
They look like creatures to you?

3921
03:51:01,440 --> 03:51:04,580
No, those, yeah, imagine if it's just like, they look like
creatures to you.

3922
03:51:05,160 --> 03:51:08,220
Those are just the, all I see are the patrons of the park.

3923
03:51:09,460 --> 03:51:11,980
Harrison, if you're you should probably leave.

3924
03:51:12,600 --> 03:51:13,760
Get out of here while you still can.

3925
03:51:14,400 --> 03:51:15,220
I can't do that.

3926
03:51:15,840 --> 03:51:16,800
I still need to find Natalie.

3927
03:51:17,180 --> 03:51:18,260
She might be in danger.

3928
03:51:19,980 --> 03:51:21,120
So you're still looking for Natalie?

3929
03:51:21,460 --> 03:51:21,920
Where have you looked?

3930
03:51:22,660 --> 03:51:23,440
Basically nowhere.

3931
03:51:24,480 --> 03:51:25,860
Everywhere I go, doors are locked.

3932
03:51:26,120 --> 03:51:26,760
Paths are blocked.

3933
03:51:27,660 --> 03:51:29,460
Always seems like I need some kind of weird key.

3934
03:51:31,480 --> 03:51:34,640
When you are not the survival horror game protagonist.

3935
03:51:37,480 --> 03:51:38,400
It's infuriating.

3936
03:51:39,020 --> 03:51:39,480
Oh yeah.

3937
03:51:39,840 --> 03:51:40,820
It's that kind of place.

3938
03:51:42,320 --> 03:51:43,880
You get the hang of it after a while.

3939
03:51:46,560 --> 03:51:48,640
I wish I had a soda vending machine in my room too.

3940
03:51:49,700 --> 03:51:49,720
Why?

3941
03:51:50,380 --> 03:51:54,940
I mean, I guess it's fun for the novelty, but you'd have to,
like, put in money.

3942
03:51:55,520 --> 03:51:58,480
I guess you'd get the money yourself, but you'd also have to
restock it.

3943
03:51:59,360 --> 03:52:00,560
Do they stay cold in there?

3944
03:52:00,900 --> 03:52:01,240
I don't know.

3945
03:52:01,320 --> 03:52:02,460
It says ice cold soda.

3946
03:52:03,200 --> 03:52:03,580
Who knows?

3947
03:52:07,900 --> 03:52:08,260
Okay.

3948
03:52:10,960 --> 03:52:11,580
All right.

3949
03:52:12,380 --> 03:52:12,380
Cool.

3950
03:52:12,940 --> 03:52:13,960
We could save in here.

3951
03:52:18,540 --> 03:52:19,520
Let's do this one.

3952
03:52:20,340 --> 03:52:22,580
He's looking really hard in that book.

3953
03:52:25,060 --> 03:52:26,820
Poor guy barely noticed me.

3954
03:52:27,920 --> 03:52:28,300
All right.

3955
03:52:28,400 --> 03:52:30,920
So we have to do something with the arcade.

3956
03:52:31,740 --> 03:52:35,000
There's still some other ways that we haven't gone to,
though, when we come back here.

3957
03:52:35,760 --> 03:52:35,840
Oh.

3958
03:52:41,230 --> 03:52:42,130
Oh, eyes!

3959
03:52:42,810 --> 03:52:43,170
Ah!

3960
03:52:47,570 --> 03:52:47,970
Oh,

3961
03:52:51,150 --> 03:52:51,670
he's gone!

3962
03:52:53,510 --> 03:52:54,430
That was fast.

3963
03:52:55,770 --> 03:52:57,030
I like how there's like little...

3964
03:52:57,030 --> 03:52:59,090
Now that I see them, I see them everywhere.

3965
03:52:59,270 --> 03:53:00,370
All these like little ores.

3966
03:53:00,950 --> 03:53:01,350
You see them?

3967
03:53:01,430 --> 03:53:02,510
All the rocks everywhere.

3968
03:53:04,570 --> 03:53:05,210
This is a...

3969
03:53:05,210 --> 03:53:06,530
This is not a boss fight, no?

3970
03:53:08,770 --> 03:53:10,210
We could try the shotgun, though.

3971
03:53:11,610 --> 03:53:12,590
It's big and heavy.

3972
03:53:13,230 --> 03:53:16,110
Apparently it belonged to Captain Nemo of the Nautilus
submarine.

3973
03:53:18,490 --> 03:53:22,010
one-handed I think she's insane

3974
03:53:27,220 --> 03:53:37,640
oh my god wait I don't know how to aim I don't know how to
aim all of a sudden wait hold on one second where is oh I

03:53:37,640 --> 03:53:39,160

I'm save scumming like a tiny bit.

3981
03:55:02,640 --> 03:55:05,320
Wait, wasn't this on the thing outside?

3982
03:55:06,140 --> 03:55:08,180
But, well, you're not even looking at it.

3983
03:55:14,720 --> 03:55:16,800
It's kind of fun to run back and forth.

3984
03:55:19,580 --> 03:55:20,060
Oh!

3985
03:55:21,060 --> 03:55:22,260
Oh, nasty.

3986
03:55:23,840 --> 03:55:24,320
Oh my god.

3987
03:55:25,120 --> 03:55:26,560
I can't deal with you right now.

3988
03:55:27,540 --> 03:55:28,060
Wait a second.

3989
03:55:29,060 --> 03:55:29,720
Wait a second.

3990
03:55:30,600 --> 03:55:30,900
Um.

3991
03:55:33,380 --> 03:55:34,800
I think we'll go with you.

3992
03:55:35,760 --> 03:55:35,840
Okay.

3993
03:55:36,100 --> 03:55:37,040
One moment please!

3994
03:55:38,620 --> 03:55:39,440
Oh my god.

3995
03:55:39,560 --> 03:55:39,680
Wait.

3996
03:55:45,340 --> 03:55:45,900
Ew.

3997
03:55:47,020 --> 03:55:49,020
One second please.

3998
03:55:49,160 --> 03:55:50,840
Please give me a moment.

3999
03:55:51,460 --> 03:55:53,040
Oh there's a here too.

4000
03:55:53,620 --> 03:55:54,480
Wait, where is the phone?

4001
03:55:55,520 --> 03:55:56,120
Are you the phone?

4002
03:55:58,440 --> 03:55:58,660
No.

4003
03:55:59,820 --> 03:56:00,400
Where's the phone?

4004
03:56:00,920 --> 03:56:01,580
Oh, here's the phone.

4005
03:56:03,640 --> 03:56:04,040
Hello?

4006
03:56:05,200 --> 03:56:06,520
Natalie, my daughter.

4007
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:07,480
She's here, isn't she?

4008
03:56:08,280 --> 03:56:09,420
Yes, she's looking for you.

4009
03:56:10,380 --> 03:56:12,540
She filed a missing person's report with the police.

4010
03:56:13,840 --> 03:56:14,640
I told her not to.

4011
03:56:14,860 --> 03:56:16,860
I thought I'd convince her not to.

4012
03:56:17,600 --> 03:56:19,340
Listen, can you get her out of here?

4013
03:56:19,500 --> 03:56:20,460
Get her to leave now.

4014
03:56:21,200 --> 03:56:22,380
Mr. Crow, she's She got hurt.

4015
03:56:22,480 --> 03:56:23,220
She was attacked.

4016
03:56:24,380 --> 03:56:24,820
I see.

4017
03:56:30,740 --> 03:56:31,520
Oh my god.

4018
03:56:31,780 --> 03:56:32,220
I was trapped.

4019
03:56:32,620 --> 03:56:33,100
There we go.

4020
03:56:34,200 --> 03:56:36,460
What is... What are these things?

4021
03:56:36,560 --> 03:56:37,200
It's a statue.

4022
03:56:37,720 --> 03:56:38,920
Fruit are friends.

4023
03:56:39,720 --> 03:56:40,260
Good to know.

4024
03:56:41,420 --> 03:56:42,800
I love to hear it.

4025
03:56:43,840 --> 03:56:45,420
Oh, there's a little trap there.

4026
03:56:47,840 --> 03:56:50,680
I think I will grenade these guys.

4027
03:56:52,360 --> 03:56:53,520
Alright, let's do this.

4028
03:56:53,920 --> 03:56:54,700
Watch this guys.

4029
03:56:54,840 --> 03:56:55,420
Watch this.

4030
03:57:01,430 --> 03:57:02,910
Oh my god.

4031
03:57:03,630 --> 03:57:04,470
Oh my god.

4032
03:57:04,950 --> 03:57:06,310
I didn't think you'd scream.

4033
03:57:07,470 --> 03:57:08,070
Ouch!

4034
03:57:09,870 --> 03:57:11,290
I didn't think I'd scream!

4035
03:57:16,770 --> 03:57:17,870
We're fine.

4036
03:57:19,590 --> 03:57:20,170
Karma!

4037
03:57:21,550 --> 03:57:23,050
Oh wait, this thing was lit up.

4038
03:57:23,150 --> 03:57:23,950
There's no keyhole.

4039
03:57:25,110 --> 03:57:26,610
Something is holding the lid shut.

4040
03:57:30,030 --> 03:57:41,450
not see the ceiling trap gamers don't look up oh my god
think you have more resources than i did at this point in

4041
03:57:41,450 --> 03:57:58,610
the game cup is empty oh luscious lime pineapple punch
groovy grape what do you guys want if i had my light on does

4042
03:57:58,610 --> 03:58:01,350
that help Lime!

4043
03:58:07,050 --> 03:58:09,710
Cup is full, but I don't want to drink it.

4044
03:58:13,820 --> 03:58:16,260
We have some Tolman's records here.

4045
03:58:17,760 --> 03:58:22,080
Marvin said that Tolman is monitoring the area.

4046
03:58:22,340 --> 03:58:22,940
I'm kind of scared.

4047
03:58:23,140 --> 03:58:25,380
If I run into him, is he friend or foe, you know?

4048
03:58:26,780 --> 03:58:27,900
March 30th.

4049
03:58:28,460 --> 03:58:30,760
Boss has begun experiments with the pool.

4050
03:58:31,440 --> 03:58:40,380
He attaches a key to a long chain and slowly the lowers it
in he waits 25 seconds and then pulls it out again it's

4051
03:58:40,380 --> 03:58:56,600
changed changed too long in some places too short in others
it's the wrong shape the pool the pool you this place is

4052
03:58:56,600 --> 03:59:00,520
nasty okay

4053
03:59:05,730 --> 03:59:09,330
this one is not the two one oh six probably Yeah, right.

4054
03:59:10,330 --> 03:59:11,490
Come in, we're open.

4055
03:59:13,130 --> 03:59:13,490
Locked.

4056
03:59:13,830 --> 03:59:14,830
But the sign says it's open.

4057
03:59:15,170 --> 03:59:15,350
Oh, right.

4058
03:59:15,450 --> 03:59:16,670
I'm looking at the back of the sign.

4059
03:59:17,110 --> 03:59:18,390
I'm kind of dumb, honestly.

4060
03:59:26,770 --> 03:59:27,170
Mara.

4061
03:59:30,760 --> 03:59:31,960
I understand her.

4062
03:59:33,240 --> 03:59:34,180
That's so funny.

4063
03:59:36,280 --> 03:59:36,820
Is this guy?

4064
03:59:37,020 --> 03:59:37,940
Oh, yeah, this guy also.

4065
03:59:41,520 --> 03:59:41,920
Oh, yeah.

4066
03:59:41,940 --> 03:59:44,460
I don't understand this one at all, I think.

4067
03:59:44,900 --> 03:59:45,700
Is this guy also?

4068
03:59:46,740 --> 03:59:47,860
Oh, wait, there's a memo here.

4069
03:59:48,240 --> 03:59:48,680
To management.

4070
03:59:48,800 --> 03:59:50,500
Can we get the code for the front door change, please?

4071
03:59:50,580 --> 03:59:51,660
It's far too easy to guess.

4072
03:59:52,500 --> 03:59:53,880
Is it the factory default or something?

4073
03:59:54,000 --> 03:59:55,300
This is a security concern.

4074
03:59:57,480 --> 03:59:58,360
Okay, hold on.

4075
03:59:59,620 --> 04:00:01,060
So it's 1-2-3-4?

4076
04:00:06,040 --> 04:00:06,760
No, why?

4077
04:00:07,280 --> 04:00:08,780
Wait, where does this lead to?

4078
04:00:11,840 --> 04:00:12,560
We're in...

4079
04:00:18,200 --> 04:00:18,920
kingdom

4080
04:00:28,740 --> 04:00:39,400
but before we do any of that well let's read this note here
neptune's palace birthdays oh that's right we need the

4081
04:00:39,400 --> 04:00:54,200
trident nice first try gamer thank you is mara forest a
peridium event oh my gosh we're both mfers wait this is

4082
04:00:54,280 --> 04:00:54,860
Crazy!

4083
04:00:59,940 --> 04:01:00,340
No!

4084
04:01:04,240 --> 04:01:06,600
Have parents place gifts inside the treasure chest.

4085
04:01:06,860 --> 04:01:08,480
During the meal, give the trident to the child.

4086
04:01:08,660 --> 04:01:10,220
The sea monsters will turn towards the trident.

4087
04:01:10,580 --> 04:01:12,020
When they're facing the trident, they'll sing.

4088
04:01:12,160 --> 04:01:14,220
As long as the trident isn't too far away.

4089
04:01:15,560 --> 04:01:17,340
If all four are singing, the chest will open.

4090
04:01:18,520 --> 04:01:20,600
The sea monsters often get stuck and don't rotate properly.

4091
04:01:20,720 --> 04:01:22,300
Just give them a tap and it should set them off.

4092
04:01:32,260 --> 04:01:32,780
Oh no.

4093
04:01:32,940 --> 04:01:34,400
Uh, I think I have to shoot this.

4094
04:01:35,880 --> 04:01:36,480
Oh, I see!

4095
04:01:36,700 --> 04:01:39,180
I- oh, uh, that's why it was green.

4096
04:01:39,460 --> 04:01:39,680
Okay.

4097
04:01:51,340 --> 04:01:52,000
There we go.

4098
04:02:00,250 --> 04:02:03,190
It sounds like two of them are going off, but it's only the
one.

4099
04:02:05,770 --> 04:02:07,850
How do I get them- all three of them to do it?

4100
04:02:14,450 --> 04:02:14,810
Uh.

4101
04:02:16,770 --> 04:02:17,130
Uh.

4102
04:02:19,050 --> 04:02:19,410
Err?

4103
04:02:22,790 --> 04:02:24,050
Okay, I got two of them.

4104
04:02:26,890 --> 04:02:29,190
It sounds like this guy's going off but he's not right.

4105
04:02:31,310 --> 04:02:34,090
I think I gotta get them more looking at me.

4106
04:02:35,690 --> 04:02:36,170
There we go.

4107
04:02:37,190 --> 04:02:40,230
And then this guy gotta get you looking at me.

4108
04:02:43,070 --> 04:02:44,190
Turned a little bit more.

4109
04:02:45,950 --> 04:02:46,270
Oh!

4110
04:02:46,550 --> 04:02:47,310
Oh, that's so close!

4111
04:02:51,540 --> 04:02:51,940
Yeah!

4112
04:02:52,860 --> 04:02:53,360
Okay.

4113
04:02:53,740 --> 04:02:54,960
Is this the silver key?

4114
04:02:55,880 --> 04:02:56,460
No way!

4115
04:02:56,700 --> 04:02:58,080
We got the silver key!

4116
04:03:00,000 --> 04:03:01,000
All right.

4117
04:03:03,520 --> 04:03:04,720
There's a little X on the floor?

4118
04:03:05,300 --> 04:03:06,100
Oh, you're so right.

4119
04:03:08,260 --> 04:03:08,960
It's okay.

4120
04:03:09,040 --> 04:03:09,900
We didn't need it.

4121
04:03:10,400 --> 04:03:11,060
We're too smart.

4122
04:03:11,240 --> 04:03:11,800
We're too good.

4123
04:03:13,760 --> 04:03:15,420
I'm curious about this.

4124
04:03:15,520 --> 04:03:16,520
The soda machine.

4125
04:03:19,380 --> 04:03:22,700
Is it on the map?

4126
04:03:22,720 --> 04:03:24,720
There's like a question mark.

4127
04:03:24,860 --> 04:03:26,040
I think that's for the soda machine.

4128
04:03:27,000 --> 04:03:27,000
Interesting.

4129
04:03:28,740 --> 04:03:31,840
The game's arcade, we need power to it.

4130
04:03:32,600 --> 04:03:34,280
So we can do the puzzle there.

4131
04:03:35,960 --> 04:03:37,200
Fruits are our friends.

4132
04:03:48,020 --> 04:03:48,700
Whoa!

4133
04:03:50,420 --> 04:03:53,840
Wait, actually what was the order here?

4134
04:03:56,280 --> 04:03:57,360
Oh, grape?

4135
04:03:58,060 --> 04:03:58,380
Lines?

4136
04:03:58,400 --> 04:04:00,160
grape lime, pineapple, strawberry.

4137
04:04:00,540 --> 04:04:02,120
Grape, lime, pineapple, strawberry.

4138
04:04:05,620 --> 04:04:07,400
Okay, hold on.

4139
04:04:09,660 --> 04:04:13,260
Grape, lime, pineapple, strawberry.

4140
04:04:16,820 --> 04:04:17,280
Whoa!

4141
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:19,700
Ticket pre-sale times are like- Oh!

4142
04:04:20,680 --> 04:04:21,240
Wait.

4143
04:04:23,800 --> 04:04:27,000
Mr. Crow keeps extra treasure maps in a wooden bureau in his
lounge.

4144
04:04:27,200 --> 04:04:28,380
The code is 8891.

4145
04:04:28,400 --> 04:04:28,600
one.

4146
04:04:29,080 --> 04:04:30,740
Oh, I think I remember seeing that.

4147
04:04:31,340 --> 04:04:32,040
Wait, one second!

4148
04:04:32,340 --> 04:04:33,860
I did say that the times would go up.

4149
04:04:33,980 --> 04:04:35,880
I don't remember what the times are myself, though.

4150
04:04:38,800 --> 04:04:39,600
Let's see.

4151
04:04:41,080 --> 04:04:41,480
Oh!

4152
04:04:42,460 --> 04:04:48,460

4153
04:04:51,800 --> 04:04:52,200

It ends January 1st.

4155
04:04:54,280 --> 04:04:54,880
Wait, you know what?

4156
04:04:54,880 --> 04:04:55,640
I'm just gonna put this up.

4157
04:04:57,520 --> 04:05:08,460
If you are interested in going to my 3D live jazz show, oh,
it's so big.

4158
04:05:13,400 --> 04:05:21,520
The pre-sale of registration ends on January 1st, and then
the ticket sales start January 2nd, 4 p.m.

4159
04:05:22,200 --> 04:05:22,540

Don't forget it!

04:05:41,750 --> 04:05:42,690

04:06:30,250 --> 04:06:32,650
What is the mint cord minus two?

4175
04:06:32,870 --> 04:06:34,430
How often are you guys using that?

4176
04:06:35,030 --> 04:06:36,030

We use it all the time.

4179
04:06:53,220 --> 04:06:54,960
Why did he say that to me?

4180
04:06:55,220 --> 04:06:56,480

Extra treasure maps.

04:08:19,320 --> 04:08:20,440
What kind of treasure are we getting?

4198
04:08:22,380 --> 04:08:23,160

04:09:00,460 --> 04:09:01,740
Find the secrets map.

4206
04:09:12,190 --> 04:09:13,830
Nothing has changed.

4207
04:09:14,350 --> 04:09:15,090
Oh, secrets!

Um...

04:10:05,290 --> 04:10:07,790
I wish I had a little bird to help me.

4214
04:10:08,670 --> 04:10:09,750
One of the hint birds.

4215
04:10:09,930 --> 04:10:13,890
I'm kind of... There's, like, a lot that I need to do, and
I'm kind of lost at what to...

4216
04:10:13,890 --> 04:10:15,430
How to... How to do them.

4217
04:10:20,020 --> 04:10:21,560
Oh, under the bones!

4218
04:10:21,740 --> 04:10:22,480
Yeah, probably.

4219
04:10:27,620 --> 04:10:31,240

4220
04:10:32,480 --> 04:10:32,920

4221
04:10:42,290 --> 04:10:44,990

where one is at.

4222
04:10:45,990 --> 04:10:47,210
What's this guy anyway?

4223
04:10:47,730 --> 04:10:48,530
Holy cow!

4224
04:10:48,750 --> 04:10:50,230
He's crazy!

4225
04:10:53,610 --> 04:10:55,250
Is there anything in the arcade now?

4226
04:10:55,370 --> 04:10:56,130
I sure hope not.

4227
04:11:02,200 --> 04:11:03,560
It seems quiet.

4228
04:11:04,820 --> 04:11:04,900

Yes.

4236
04:11:14,500 --> 04:11:18,400
The data disk is hidden inside a change machine.

4237
04:11:24,740 --> 04:11:26,500
Like in here?

4238
04:11:32,280 --> 04:11:35,820

04:14:14,830 --> 04:14:15,150
Oh.

4277
04:14:16,050 --> 04:14:17,230
You have to like hold it.

4278
04:14:22,540 --> 04:14:22,800
Okay.

4279
04:14:24,060 --> 04:14:24,560
Oh.

4280
04:14:25,060 --> 04:14:25,240
Oh.

4281
04:14:25,440 --> 04:14:25,500
Oh.

4282
04:14:25,640 --> 04:14:25,800
Oh.

4283
04:14:26,360 --> 04:14:27,280
I'm stupid.

4284
04:14:27,500 --> 04:14:27,740
Maybe.

4285
04:14:28,000 --> 04:14:28,680
I'm stupid maybe.

4286
04:14:28,840 --> 04:14:28,940
Okay.

4287
04:14:29,020 --> 04:14:29,900
We're fin- No!

4288
04:14:30,500 --> 04:14:32,260

04:14:37,370 --> 04:14:37,890
Two.

4290
04:14:39,110 --> 04:14:39,630
Three.

4291
04:14:40,690 --> 04:14:41,090
Four.

4292
04:14:41,330 --> 04:14:41,510
Okay.

4293
04:14:41,550 --> 04:14:41,970

Seven?

4298
04:15:19,800 --> 04:15:21,300
No, I said it.

4299
04:15:21,380 --> 04:15:22,120
I said the numbers.

4300
04:15:24,640 --> 04:15:26,100
Don't say it.

4301
04:15:28,260 --> 04:15:29,740
Something in the coin slot.

4302
04:15:30,640 --> 04:15:32,480
We got the security access.

4303
04:15:37,520 --> 04:15:39,460
What does this have to do?

4304
04:15:39,580 --> 04:15:40,540
Did it pop out?

4305
04:15:40,900 --> 04:15:41,500
Am I dumb?

4306
04:15:42,020 --> 04:15:44,500
Maybe it would have popped out.

4307
04:15:44,920 --> 04:15:45,020
Wait.

4308
04:15:45,880 --> 04:15:47,000
Can I do this too?

4309
04:15:49,280 --> 04:15:50,440
Move the claw.

4310
04:15:53,320 --> 04:15:53,760
Drop.

4311
04:15:54,800 --> 04:15:55,360
Oh, right.

4312
04:15:57,300 --> 04:15:58,820
Okay, we got this, guys.

4313
04:16:01,480 --> 04:16:02,360
What is this thing, anyway?

4314
04:16:03,680 --> 04:16:04,660
Now do the trivia.

4315
04:16:04,760 --> 04:16:05,380
You're so right.

4316
04:16:05,960 --> 04:16:06,780
This sucks.

4317
04:16:06,960 --> 04:16:07,280
Play again.

4318
04:16:14,920 --> 04:16:16,520
I'm trying to get this guy right here.

4319
04:16:22,380 --> 04:16:23,260
It's rigged.

4320
04:16:23,520 --> 04:16:24,220
You're so right.

4321
04:16:29,780 --> 04:16:31,400
Oh, that's perfect.

4322
04:16:39,030 --> 04:16:39,690
Even Bakadan.

4323
04:16:40,930 --> 04:16:41,530
Alright, guys.

4324
04:16:43,990 --> 04:16:46,330
What is the approximate population on Earth?

4325
04:16:50,230 --> 04:16:50,870
Billion?

4326
04:16:51,950 --> 04:16:52,390
Four?

4327
04:16:53,270 --> 04:16:54,190
Five billion?

4328
04:16:55,090 --> 04:16:55,770
Six billion?

4329
04:17:02,230 --> 04:17:03,590
Six billion?

4330
04:17:05,970 --> 04:17:06,850
Wrong.

4331
04:17:08,270 --> 04:17:10,210
What is the tallest building in the world?

4332
04:17:10,870 --> 04:17:12,710
Empire State Building.

4333
04:17:21,600 --> 04:17:24,200
What is the highest grossing film of all time?

4334
04:17:30,840 --> 04:17:31,360
Yeetie!

4335
04:17:33,240 --> 04:17:36,120
What kind of foods should he eat the most of every day?

4336
04:17:38,780 --> 04:17:40,120
Fruits and veg...

4337
04:17:40,660 --> 04:17:44,120
Bread, wait, isn't the bread cereal pasta at the bottom of
the...

4338
04:17:45,160 --> 04:17:45,720
The food?

4339
04:17:47,100 --> 04:17:47,620
Yeah!

4340
04:17:49,280 --> 04:17:52,200
Which area of the tongue is used for tasting sweet things?

4341
04:17:54,160 --> 04:17:55,200
The tippy tip?

4342
04:17:55,860 --> 04:17:56,920
I think it's the tippy tip.

4343
04:18:11,640 --> 04:18:13,320
How many countries are there in Europe?

4344
04:18:31,960 --> 04:18:35,020
I saw 32, 34, and 30 all in a row.

4345
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:40,040
I'll go with 32.

4346
04:18:42,120 --> 04:18:42,600
Wrong.

4347
04:18:44,680 --> 04:18:44,920
Okay.

4348
04:18:46,260 --> 04:18:46,740
Um.

4349
04:18:47,560 --> 04:18:48,260
Is this one where...

4350
04:18:48,260 --> 04:18:48,540
Oh, wait.

4351
04:18:48,620 --> 04:18:50,000
Oh, that's our hint guy.

4352
04:18:50,180 --> 04:18:51,060
This one, too.

4353
04:18:53,480 --> 04:18:54,260
Alright, hold it.

4354
04:18:54,280 --> 04:18:54,860
charge.

4355
04:18:56,620 --> 04:18:57,360
Oh my!

4356
04:18:59,690 --> 04:19:00,610
I can't do it.

4357
04:19:00,650 --> 04:19:01,430
I can't play again.

4358
04:19:01,970 --> 04:19:02,710
I can't play again.

4359
04:19:02,870 --> 04:19:03,310
I'm too good.

4360
04:19:04,990 --> 04:19:06,030
I'm literally too good.

4361
04:19:07,890 --> 04:19:11,450
I wanted to play that one too.

4362
04:19:12,030 --> 04:19:12,290
Alright.

4363
04:19:12,630 --> 04:19:13,450
What am I doing now?

4364
04:19:13,690 --> 04:19:14,490
Sorry, I forgot.

4365
04:19:15,410 --> 04:19:16,690
We got the disc.

4366
04:19:17,010 --> 04:19:17,390
The disc.

4367
04:19:17,590 --> 04:19:17,830
The disc.

4368
04:19:18,270 --> 04:19:23,330
So, um, the dungeon and the, uh, what was the other place?

4369
04:19:24,610 --> 04:19:27,790
The dungeon had it And...

4370
04:19:27,790 --> 04:19:27,950
Oh!

4371
04:19:28,810 --> 04:19:29,790
The train room!

4372
04:19:29,870 --> 04:19:30,590
The train room!

4373
04:19:32,070 --> 04:19:34,410
We could probably go to the train room first.

4374
04:19:45,260 --> 04:19:45,400
Whoa!

4375
04:19:46,700 --> 04:19:47,380
It's raining.

4376
04:19:53,440 --> 04:19:54,280
Oh my gosh.

4377
04:19:54,540 --> 04:19:54,900
Oh my gosh.

4378
04:19:55,440 --> 04:19:55,700
Oh wait!

4379
04:19:55,780 --> 04:19:56,420
That's the restaurant.

4380
04:19:57,000 --> 04:19:58,220
I've messed up.

4381
04:20:03,300 --> 04:20:03,660
Ouch!

4382
04:20:03,960 --> 04:20:04,220
Ouch!

4383
04:20:06,180 --> 04:20:07,040
Oh my god!

4384
04:20:07,260 --> 04:20:08,260
Everything's trying to kill me.

4385
04:20:08,700 --> 04:20:09,340
For real though.

4386
04:20:10,820 --> 04:20:11,340
Uh...

4387
04:20:11,680 --> 04:20:13,000
I need, like, health bed.

4388
04:20:13,360 --> 04:20:14,120
Oh, I'm poisoned!

4389
04:20:14,960 --> 04:20:15,700
Okay, we're fine.

4390
04:20:19,100 --> 04:20:20,320
Saving the submarine?

4391
04:20:21,140 --> 04:20:22,280
We're already here.

4392
04:20:24,440 --> 04:20:25,200
It's okay.

4393
04:20:25,540 --> 04:20:26,340
We're already here.

4394
04:20:28,280 --> 04:20:29,360
Things are getting bad, you guys.

4395
04:20:30,720 --> 04:20:31,880
Things are getting bad, bad.

4396
04:20:32,900 --> 04:20:33,400
Holy cow.

4397
04:20:34,480 --> 04:20:35,320
Holy moly.

4398
04:20:38,160 --> 04:20:40,080
But you're caught in the bear trap.

4399
04:20:41,680 --> 04:20:42,660
fighting for your life.

4400
04:20:43,280 --> 04:20:45,940
Quiet, quiet.

4401
04:20:46,820 --> 04:20:47,000
Okay.

4402
04:20:47,500 --> 04:20:48,500
Slot for a disc.

4403
04:20:59,580 --> 04:20:59,780
A?

4404
04:21:00,400 --> 04:21:01,060
Wait, what is this?

4405
04:21:01,200 --> 04:21:01,500
Orion?

4406
04:21:01,700 --> 04:21:03,140
Oh, it's Orion's Odyssey!

4407
04:21:03,520 --> 04:21:03,960
Oh, shoot.

4408
04:21:04,500 --> 04:21:06,820
Um, where did we read about this?

4409
04:21:18,980 --> 04:21:19,620
Uh...

4410
04:21:19,620 --> 04:21:22,060
Okay, hold on.

4411
04:21:24,860 --> 04:21:25,500
No.

4412
04:21:25,500 --> 04:21:26,600
Orion's Odyssey.

4413
04:21:27,560 --> 04:21:27,860
Here!

4414
04:21:28,340 --> 04:21:32,780
Are Grandest Steam Engine elegantly combining all four
design styles?

4415
04:21:33,300 --> 04:21:34,480
Uh, okay, never mind.

4416
04:21:34,920 --> 04:21:35,960
Doesn't help much at all.

4417
04:21:38,840 --> 04:21:39,320
Uh...

4418
04:21:41,780 --> 04:21:43,460
I don't know at all.

4419
04:21:49,680 --> 04:21:50,960
What does it mean?

4420
04:22:02,500 --> 04:22:04,080
Oh, it doesn't look much different.

4421
04:22:05,480 --> 04:22:05,940
Here's a hint.

4422
04:22:06,060 --> 04:22:07,820
Start with the one that appears in both clues.

4423
04:22:08,920 --> 04:22:12,480
Find Steam Engine beautifully combining the Arabella and
Bernadette design.

4424
04:22:12,500 --> 04:22:13,620
line styles.

4425
04:22:20,070 --> 04:22:20,490
Arabella.

4426
04:22:29,080 --> 04:22:29,520
Arabella.

4427
04:22:36,240 --> 04:22:42,340
I see you guys saying things, but I also don't understand
how you're getting it, so I want to figure it out too.

4428
04:23:02,570 --> 04:23:03,770
So what is it?

4429
04:23:03,890 --> 04:23:04,930
Wait, also, let me see.

4430
04:23:05,190 --> 04:23:11,450
Did it have 1934, 1927.

4431
04:23:11,650 --> 04:23:12,650
So I think it's AD.

4432
04:23:12,930 --> 04:23:15,050
A, B.

4433
04:23:25,890 --> 04:23:27,450
Does it matter which one I press?

4434
04:23:34,650 --> 04:23:35,190
Wait.

4435
04:23:49,900 --> 04:23:50,340
Ew.

4436
04:24:00,710 --> 04:24:01,950
Let's see.

4437
04:24:02,690 --> 04:24:05,190
We're trying to get...

4438
04:24:06,890 --> 04:24:08,930
The yellow blue, right?

4439
04:24:10,150 --> 04:24:11,990
This is red blue.

4440
04:24:14,250 --> 04:24:15,050
Does it change?

4441
04:24:15,190 --> 04:24:16,510
I don't think it did, though, right?

4442
04:24:31,010 --> 04:24:32,330
No, it's not changing.

4443
04:24:35,550 --> 04:24:38,230
So the two trains tell you what A, B, D looks like.

4444
04:24:39,190 --> 04:24:40,610
And Orion tells you the order.

4445
04:24:41,850 --> 04:24:41,890
What?

4446
04:24:44,190 --> 04:24:46,270
I think I don't understand that.

4447
04:24:57,940 --> 04:24:58,800
Oh, wait.

4448
04:24:59,040 --> 04:24:59,200
Okay.

4449
04:25:01,380 --> 04:25:03,780
No, I think I'm still confused, though.

4450
04:25:05,060 --> 04:25:05,080
Wait.

4451
04:25:16,710 --> 04:25:18,150
This one's confusing.

4452
04:25:18,210 --> 04:25:19,310
I'm confused!

4453
04:25:21,410 --> 04:25:24,750
You gotta figure out which style name matches the style of
the car.

4454
04:25:25,230 --> 04:25:27,030
Yeah, but how am I supposed to tell?

4455
04:25:28,670 --> 04:25:30,510
I don't really get it.

4456
04:25:34,160 --> 04:25:36,080
I think I don't understand it.

4457
04:26:00,530 --> 04:26:02,850
Because one car is the same in both examples.

4458
04:26:14,310 --> 04:26:14,810
Oh, wait.

4459
04:26:16,630 --> 04:26:17,730
I remember Bella Bernadette.

4460
04:26:52,910 --> 04:26:54,030
So it would be...

4461
04:26:55,130 --> 04:27:11,450
the Arabella so a and then okay I think maybe I get it
what's this one this was Bernadette that would be the third

4462
04:27:11,450 --> 04:27:26,500
thing right Bernadette would be be here yeah be here and
then

4463
04:27:30,140 --> 04:27:30,820
Uh...

4464
04:27:32,860 --> 04:27:36,000
This one is...

4465
04:27:37,780 --> 04:27:40,700
The blue is what?

4466
04:27:41,940 --> 04:27:43,780
I think I get it.

4467
04:27:43,860 --> 04:27:45,920
The Lila, so D...

4468
04:27:49,820 --> 04:27:52,380
D, and then this one, it must be C.

4469
04:27:54,820 --> 04:27:55,500
But...

4470
04:27:55,500 --> 04:27:57,160
It didn't do anything.

4471
04:28:00,600 --> 04:28:01,580
Oh, wait.

4472
04:28:01,580 --> 04:28:03,380
I did D twice.

4473
04:28:03,960 --> 04:28:04,680
Wait, uh, wait.

4474
04:28:04,820 --> 04:28:05,600
I think I messed up.

4475
04:28:05,740 --> 04:28:06,460
Ah, wait.

4476
04:28:07,020 --> 04:28:07,660
Which one?

4477
04:28:07,780 --> 04:28:07,980
Wait.

4478
04:28:08,740 --> 04:28:09,940
I think I messed up!

4479
04:28:10,060 --> 04:28:11,360
Wait, I don't remember which it was!

4480
04:28:11,660 --> 04:28:11,860
Ah!

4481
04:28:13,680 --> 04:28:14,480
Oh no!

4482
04:28:14,980 --> 04:28:15,420
Wait.

4483
04:28:16,780 --> 04:28:17,720
Two was B.

4484
04:28:18,380 --> 04:28:19,200
Wait, this one was B.

4485
04:28:20,420 --> 04:28:21,100
Okay, okay, okay.

4486
04:28:22,260 --> 04:28:23,400
I messed it up.

4487
04:28:23,760 --> 04:28:25,160
A, D, B, C.

4488
04:28:32,010 --> 04:28:32,450
Uh.

4489
04:28:37,840 --> 04:28:38,280
Hmm?

4490
04:28:40,320 --> 04:28:41,520
Wait, but now I'm confused.

4491
04:28:42,360 --> 04:28:44,080
Was something supposed to happen or...

4492
04:28:46,460 --> 04:28:47,360
A is 3.

4493
04:28:47,700 --> 04:28:48,240
Wait, what?

4494
04:28:49,780 --> 04:28:52,300
How is A 3 when it was the engine?

4495
04:28:55,940 --> 04:28:58,380
I think you messed up which one is Arabella.

4496
04:28:58,680 --> 04:28:58,840
Wait.

4497
04:29:02,180 --> 04:29:02,700
Arabella...

4498
04:29:02,700 --> 04:29:04,000
Is the engine, no?

4499
04:29:17,760 --> 04:29:18,580
Arabella Delilah.

4500
04:29:18,580 --> 04:29:18,960
Arabella Delilah.

4501
04:29:23,010 --> 04:29:24,910
Oh, it is slightly different.

4502
04:29:27,550 --> 04:29:31,730
That one had square windows as the engine.

4503
04:29:34,750 --> 04:29:35,470
Okay, wait.

4504
04:29:39,820 --> 04:29:41,840
Wait, it's not the design, it's the color?

4505
04:29:52,680 --> 04:29:54,240
Just the colors.

4506
04:30:09,540 --> 04:30:11,620
So Arabella would be the orange.

4507
04:30:19,010 --> 04:30:19,470
Okay.

4508
04:30:21,130 --> 04:30:21,710
Oh my gosh.

4509
04:30:21,870 --> 04:30:23,410
I wish I could just take a picture of them.

4510
04:30:28,500 --> 04:30:31,480
The lilac is blue, right?

4511
04:30:33,000 --> 04:30:33,460
Blue.

4512
04:30:34,620 --> 04:30:35,840
So the second one is D.

4513
04:30:37,320 --> 04:30:38,440
Which I think I already have.

4514
04:30:39,300 --> 04:30:44,760
And then this one is Bernadette, which is yellow, which
would be V.

4515
04:30:45,140 --> 04:30:46,040
Which is the first one.

4516
04:30:54,750 --> 04:30:55,210
V.

4517
04:30:55,670 --> 04:30:55,930
Oh!

4518
04:30:56,370 --> 04:30:56,690
Oh!

4519
04:30:56,710 --> 04:30:58,070
I heard something open.

4520
04:30:58,170 --> 04:30:58,470
Ah!

4521
04:31:00,470 --> 04:31:02,390
Oh my gosh, it's a flamethrower!

4522
04:31:04,430 --> 04:31:06,350
Wait, you mean we didn't have to do this?

4523
04:31:11,110 --> 04:31:12,910
Is that what you just said to me, game?

4524
04:31:15,230 --> 04:31:16,450
Where's my flamethrower?

4525
04:31:17,670 --> 04:31:19,050
What does it use?

4526
04:31:25,150 --> 04:31:25,650
Oh.

4527
04:31:28,770 --> 04:31:30,430
Yeah, well, I'll save.

4528
04:31:36,210 --> 04:31:44,030
okay cool um let's go to wait so the dungeon we definitely
have to do because it's circled

4529
04:31:47,640 --> 04:31:58,300
and then we got the secret here the toilet can i even get
the thing in the toilet i wonder what could i use the

4530
04:31:58,300 --> 04:32:02,740
trident to dig up the bones the bones?

4531
04:32:04,000 --> 04:32:04,400
I'm gonna...

4532
04:32:04,400 --> 04:32:05,900
Wait, I don't want to use my...

4533
04:32:05,900 --> 04:32:06,880
I'll go back to you.

4534
04:32:07,640 --> 04:32:08,040
Oh, my

4535
04:32:12,770 --> 04:32:12,930
bad.

4536
04:32:14,190 --> 04:32:14,510
Flamethrower!

4537
04:32:16,490 --> 04:32:17,110
Oh my gosh.

4538
04:32:17,490 --> 04:32:18,250
Get away from me.

4539
04:32:18,510 --> 04:32:18,830
Stinky.

4540
04:32:20,810 --> 04:32:22,730
Are there gonna be guys in here now too, right?

4541
04:32:23,510 --> 04:32:24,270
Oh my god, no.

4542
04:32:24,310 --> 04:32:25,810
There's just a trap on the ceiling.

4543
04:32:31,120 --> 04:32:31,440
Rude.

4544
04:32:32,100 --> 04:32:33,380
Oh no, there is a guy in here.

4545
04:32:34,120 --> 04:32:34,600
Oh my god.

4546
04:32:39,870 --> 04:32:40,510
Oh wow.

4547
04:32:40,890 --> 04:32:43,950
Oh, he was in here!

4548
04:32:44,210 --> 04:32:45,230
You nasty!

4549
04:32:45,870 --> 04:32:47,710
Covered in blood, it smells so bad!

4550
04:32:47,910 --> 04:32:48,690
Oh my god!

4551
04:32:49,030 --> 04:32:51,790
Limthrow is optional, but it's really good to help you skip
some puzzles.

4552
04:32:52,450 --> 04:32:53,130
Oh, fun!

4553
04:32:55,890 --> 04:32:56,990
Okay, bones.

4554
04:32:58,970 --> 04:33:00,250
Let's use the trident.

4555
04:33:00,630 --> 04:33:01,210
It doesn't work.

4556
04:33:01,330 --> 04:33:03,190
Let's use the crank handle.

4557
04:33:03,310 --> 04:33:03,810
It doesn't work.

4558
04:33:03,930 --> 04:33:04,890
Let's use...

4559
04:33:06,310 --> 04:33:07,590
The sad man!

4560
04:33:07,770 --> 04:33:08,490
It doesn't work!

4561
04:33:08,590 --> 04:33:08,910
No!

4562
04:33:09,330 --> 04:33:10,810
Okay, well...

4563
04:33:10,890 --> 04:33:12,330
We're Peronia, I guess.

4564
04:33:13,790 --> 04:33:15,370
I interrupted him.

4565
04:33:15,990 --> 04:33:16,850
All right, to the dungeon!

4566
04:33:17,250 --> 04:33:17,890
To the dungeon.

4567
04:33:21,960 --> 04:33:22,680
Out!

4568
04:33:29,360 --> 04:33:29,800
Holy!

4569
04:33:30,880 --> 04:33:32,660
Dungeon is in here.

4570
04:33:34,020 --> 04:33:34,960
We're jukeing?

4571
04:33:35,100 --> 04:33:35,520
We're jukeing?

4572
04:33:36,920 --> 04:33:37,680
Oh my god.

4573
04:33:38,480 --> 04:33:38,880
Oh my god.

4574
04:33:39,000 --> 04:33:43,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

4575
04:33:45,020 --> 04:33:45,740
Okay.

4576
04:34:00,990 --> 04:34:01,350
Shit.

4577
04:34:01,990 --> 04:34:02,310
Shit!

4578
04:34:05,070 --> 04:34:05,430
Critical!

4579
04:34:06,030 --> 04:34:06,530
Uh-oh.

4580
04:34:07,650 --> 04:34:08,370
Uh-oh.

4581
04:34:08,410 --> 04:34:09,010
Well, there's one more.

4582
04:34:09,250 --> 04:34:09,410
Okay.

4583
04:34:12,750 --> 04:34:13,330
Wait, wait.

4584
04:34:13,470 --> 04:34:13,790
I didn't...

4585
04:34:13,790 --> 04:34:14,830
Oh, he exploded himself.

4586
04:34:20,040 --> 04:34:21,160
I think there was one more.

4587
04:34:22,880 --> 04:34:23,240
Oops!

4588
04:34:24,900 --> 04:34:26,020
I didn't mean to do that.

4589
04:34:26,280 --> 04:34:28,300
I meant to turn my flashlight on, but it is on.

4590
04:34:28,460 --> 04:34:29,460
It's just really crappy.

4591
04:34:38,650 --> 04:34:56,070
this is fine this is okay this is fine everything is fine
poor guy had no chance I just took him out like that okay

4592
04:34:56,950 --> 04:35:08,870
give me my disc put it in legs arms head eyes okay I took a
picture I think of what we needed for.

4593
04:35:12,310 --> 04:35:14,210
The following doors are now locked electronically.

4594
04:35:14,750 --> 04:35:15,330
Dungeon...

4595
04:35:15,330 --> 04:35:15,750
Oh, wait.

4596
04:35:16,290 --> 04:35:19,570
They can be opened via the dungeon computer terminal.

4597
04:35:28,400 --> 04:35:29,580
Is it also...

4598
04:35:30,320 --> 04:35:31,940
Their gears, I suppose.

4599
04:35:33,420 --> 04:35:35,340
How many legs does a snake have?

4600
04:35:38,500 --> 04:35:41,220
But also how many legs does a mermaid have?

4601
04:35:41,560 --> 04:35:42,560
Or are we counting them?

4602
04:35:42,580 --> 04:35:43,420
them all together.

4603
04:35:44,800 --> 04:35:46,180
Wolf would be four.

4604
04:35:47,540 --> 04:35:50,300
Does the tail tail count as one?

4605
04:35:51,220 --> 04:35:52,200
Cyclops would be two.

4606
04:36:07,190 --> 04:36:08,770
Wait, but it only goes up to four.

4607
04:36:09,110 --> 04:36:10,510
Wait, I'm so confused.

4608
04:36:15,630 --> 04:36:18,070
Because the Cyclops would have two.

4609
04:36:18,570 --> 04:36:20,510
Maybe the legs are not four.

4610
04:36:20,650 --> 04:36:21,410
Maybe it's four.

4611
04:36:23,490 --> 04:36:23,930
overall.

4612
04:36:28,930 --> 04:36:30,010
It's total, right?

4613
04:36:30,130 --> 04:36:31,030
It has to be total.

4614
04:36:32,430 --> 04:36:33,310
Would be...

4615
04:36:33,310 --> 04:36:34,370
Wait, 2, 4.

4616
04:36:36,330 --> 04:36:38,090
Oh, it depends on which gate you want to open.

4617
04:36:38,190 --> 04:36:39,050
Is that how it works?

4618
04:36:43,910 --> 04:36:45,170
Oh, I see.

4619
04:36:48,230 --> 04:36:49,130
What's in there?

4620
04:36:49,570 --> 04:36:50,010
Antidote.

4621
04:36:50,250 --> 04:36:51,190
Do I need an antidote?

4622
04:36:51,430 --> 04:36:53,750
Maybe okay.

4623
04:36:57,650 --> 04:36:59,390
What's in here?

4624
04:37:02,470 --> 04:37:03,130
More shot.

4625
04:37:03,510 --> 04:37:03,910
Shotty.

4626
04:37:05,030 --> 04:37:07,910
Shotty, I'm here for you.

4627
04:37:08,070 --> 04:37:09,070
Legs.

4628
04:37:09,830 --> 04:37:10,090
Two.

4629
04:37:10,490 --> 04:37:10,830
Arms.

4630
04:37:11,590 --> 04:37:11,590
Two.

4631
04:37:11,930 --> 04:37:12,050
Heads.

4632
04:37:12,410 --> 04:37:12,410
One.

4633
04:37:13,350 --> 04:37:14,050
What?

4634
04:37:15,610 --> 04:37:17,390
Wait, did it open, right?

4635
04:37:17,930 --> 04:37:18,170
Okay.

4636
04:37:19,830 --> 04:37:20,670
Shotty.

4637
04:37:22,070 --> 04:37:22,510
Okay.

4638
04:37:23,170 --> 04:37:24,650
Oh, and there's health in here too.

4639
04:37:26,690 --> 04:37:27,150
Okay, good.

4640
04:37:30,810 --> 04:37:31,250
Oh,

4641
04:37:36,410 --> 04:37:44,490
it's the acid!

4642
04:37:46,630 --> 04:37:48,090
Oh, you get the acid bottle!

4643
04:37:49,090 --> 04:37:50,390
What do I mean it that for?

4644
04:37:51,430 --> 04:37:53,270
I'll take the hand to do it.

4645
04:37:54,650 --> 04:37:57,010
Sure, I can't see you, thank you.

4646
04:37:58,290 --> 04:37:59,710
A more, more, more, more.

4647
04:38:00,530 --> 04:38:00,990
Snake.

4648
04:38:03,170 --> 04:38:04,050
Legs, zero.

4649
04:38:04,710 --> 04:38:05,610
Arms, zero.

4650
04:38:06,070 --> 04:38:07,510
Head, one, eyes, two?

4651
04:38:08,190 --> 04:38:09,030
Oh, I hear it.

4652
04:38:09,170 --> 04:38:10,330
Yeah, yeah.

4653
04:38:14,930 --> 04:38:15,670
All right.

4654
04:38:17,750 --> 04:38:18,690
Very cool.

4655
04:38:19,550 --> 04:38:21,590
I still have... what gun am I using?

4656
04:38:21,710 --> 04:38:22,590
Okay, my handgun.

4657
04:38:30,180 --> 04:38:43,580
I'm hearing something going I thought about the acid for the
bones You think it'll work Why not you know Why not Take a

4658
04:38:43,580 --> 04:39:00,100
crazy chance I hate the camera angle in this Oh my gosh I
hate that it I really hate I That it, like, flips my camera

4659
04:39:00,100 --> 04:39:00,980
around.

4660
04:39:03,480 --> 04:39:03,660
Acid!

4661
04:39:05,100 --> 04:39:06,800
Not enough acid in the bottle.

4662
04:39:08,060 --> 04:39:09,520
Wait, we can refill it, right?

4663
04:39:10,500 --> 04:39:11,520
That's what the guy said.

4664
04:39:11,660 --> 04:39:12,560
You can refill it.

4665
04:39:21,000 --> 04:39:22,320
Train room, my beloved.

4666
04:39:28,800 --> 04:39:31,260
I'm just gonna save...

4667
04:39:31,260 --> 04:39:31,620
Here.

4668
04:39:35,070 --> 04:39:39,530
It's not that it gives me motion sickness, it's just that
it's hard to see when I leave the room, you know.

4669
04:39:41,050 --> 04:39:42,650
Okay, something about acid.

4670
04:39:45,350 --> 04:39:46,230
Field trip.

4671
04:39:46,890 --> 04:39:47,910
High scores.

4672
04:39:53,750 --> 04:39:54,690
Have we been to the underground?

4673
04:39:54,710 --> 04:39:56,790
We haven't been to the underground area, have we?

4674
04:39:57,630 --> 04:39:58,290
Access them.

4675
04:39:58,550 --> 04:39:59,930
Switch that unlocks all the gates in the underground.

4676
04:40:04,670 --> 04:40:07,110
Did you get your free mushroom upgrade?

4677
04:40:07,270 --> 04:40:08,550
Yeah, I did it!

4678
04:40:10,110 --> 04:40:12,950
Yeah, there's some sort of acid tank somewhere.

4679
04:40:14,930 --> 04:40:17,230
Oh, you could refill it in the acid tank.

4680
04:40:17,370 --> 04:40:19,470
I heard from Crowe, moved it to the underground level.

4681
04:40:19,850 --> 04:40:22,550
I need to figure out how to...

4682
04:40:22,550 --> 04:40:25,490
I guess we need to get to a...

4683
04:40:27,210 --> 04:40:28,870
A elevator, I suppose.

4684
04:40:30,670 --> 04:40:34,110
Because I think the disc maybe opens the elevator, I think.

4685
04:40:41,900 --> 04:40:44,640
Seven Seas Mermaids use the same kind of battery as the
giant Crowe.

4686
04:40:46,140 --> 04:40:47,700
Oh, I forgot about this, too.

4687
04:40:50,160 --> 04:40:51,800
Good night, Mito, good night, Aibus.

4688
04:40:52,180 --> 04:40:53,560
Good night, one minute, Hiro!

4689
04:40:54,240 --> 04:40:55,140
Thank you for the summertime!

4690
04:40:55,820 --> 04:40:56,840
Thank you, thank you.

4691
04:40:58,960 --> 04:41:01,200
Yeah, the battery from the mermaids to give to the crawl.

4692
04:41:12,150 --> 04:41:12,910
I'm going...

4693
04:41:12,910 --> 04:41:14,570
I think there is a...

4694
04:41:15,250 --> 04:41:19,190
In the utility corridor that my head is blocking.

4695
04:41:20,570 --> 04:41:21,050
I think...

4696
04:41:21,050 --> 04:41:21,530
Was there...

4697
04:41:21,530 --> 04:41:23,130
Yes, there's an elevator right there.

4698
04:41:23,710 --> 04:41:26,470
I think that would be the easiest one.

4699
04:41:26,590 --> 04:41:27,570
to get to.

4700
04:41:28,370 --> 04:41:30,590
There's also still something in the theater we have to do.

4701
04:41:35,720 --> 04:41:36,060
Oh, gosh.

4702
04:41:36,260 --> 04:41:36,940
Now I can't see it at all.

4703
04:41:37,160 --> 04:41:37,580
Oh, my god.

4704
04:41:37,980 --> 04:41:40,340
Juke, juke, juke.

4705
04:41:46,450 --> 04:41:48,490
Juke, juke, juke, juke.

4706
04:41:48,990 --> 04:41:49,250
Oh, my god.

4707
04:41:49,430 --> 04:41:49,770
Little babies.

4708
04:41:53,170 --> 04:41:54,750
Is she still in here?

4709
04:41:58,510 --> 04:42:00,130
I sure hope not.

4710
04:42:06,330 --> 04:42:09,410
So now Fatal error.

4711
04:42:10,710 --> 04:42:11,210
Nothing happened.

4712
04:42:11,590 --> 04:42:12,210
Must be broken.

4713
04:42:15,910 --> 04:42:16,350
Uh.

4714
04:42:18,090 --> 04:42:19,010
What was in here?

4715
04:42:19,110 --> 04:42:20,730
Oh, this was the place where they were...

4716
04:42:20,730 --> 04:42:21,330
Oh, my God.

4717
04:42:21,570 --> 04:42:21,950
Wait a second.

4718
04:42:22,830 --> 04:42:23,990
What is that down there?

4719
04:42:24,330 --> 04:42:25,550
Wait, is this a secret?

4720
04:42:27,890 --> 04:42:28,290
No?

4721
04:42:29,390 --> 04:42:30,230
What is that?

4722
04:42:30,510 --> 04:42:31,610
What is that right there?

4723
04:42:46,740 --> 04:42:47,780
Can I kill this crow?

4724
04:42:49,640 --> 04:42:50,080
Yeah.

4725
04:42:51,400 --> 04:42:53,520
Yeah, it's an ammo box, but what is it?

4726
04:42:54,120 --> 04:42:55,420
It's a box of handgun ammo.

4727
04:43:17,210 --> 04:43:17,610
Wow.

4728
04:43:20,090 --> 04:43:20,490
Wow.

4729
04:43:20,910 --> 04:43:22,850
In a useless room, nonetheless.

4730
04:43:24,250 --> 04:43:28,150
Okay, I should find maybe a bird.

4731
04:43:28,790 --> 04:43:30,090
Or I could go back to the theater.

4732
04:43:30,250 --> 04:43:31,610
How did I get to the theater anyway?

4733
04:43:32,010 --> 04:43:34,110
Everything is so overrun, I'm scared to go anywhere.

4734
04:43:36,950 --> 04:43:38,810
Let's go back to the haunted house.

4735
04:43:43,000 --> 04:43:52,820
little baby watch out baby watch out excuse me excuse me
excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me the color was

4736
04:43:52,820 --> 04:43:59,980

4737
04:43:59,980 --> 04:44:02,840

4738
04:44:12,960 --> 04:44:20,140
still just the one guy in there yeah really oh my god oh my
god Oh my god.

4739
04:44:20,340 --> 04:44:21,280
Oh, please, please.

4740
04:44:21,920 --> 04:44:22,080
Oh!

4741
04:44:25,790 --> 04:44:26,270
Stop!

4742
04:44:27,110 --> 04:44:28,090
You guys are the worst.

4743
04:44:31,250 --> 04:44:32,570
Another dude here.

4744
04:44:32,870 --> 04:44:33,670
Okay, to the theater.

4745
04:44:38,490 --> 04:44:40,110
They just, like, breathe.

4746
04:44:41,030 --> 04:44:41,730
Like, stop it.

4747
04:44:41,830 --> 04:44:42,550
Stop doing that.

4748
04:44:43,530 --> 04:44:45,110
This place is probably overrun now, too.

4749
04:44:47,350 --> 04:44:49,370
There's something I gotta do in here.

4750
04:44:50,710 --> 04:44:51,530
Oh, am I okay?

4751
04:44:51,910 --> 04:44:52,550
I'm injured.

4752
04:44:52,950 --> 04:44:54,290
I'm gonna run out of everything.

4753
04:44:54,310 --> 04:44:55,330
at this point.

4754
04:44:55,650 --> 04:44:56,770
I'm gonna run out of hell.

4755
04:45:01,130 --> 04:45:04,190
Varnish the ocean kingdom storage room door.

4756
04:45:05,470 --> 04:45:07,150
That's right, the storage room door.

4757
04:45:08,410 --> 04:45:12,330
As I was trying, I thought I could shoot it, but I couldn't
remember which one it was.

4758
04:45:16,500 --> 04:45:18,680
I think that guy is not alive.

4759
04:45:22,340 --> 04:45:24,380
I'm completely confused.

4760
04:45:27,900 --> 04:45:28,660
There's a valve here.

4761
04:45:28,680 --> 04:45:29,100
here.

4762
04:45:30,400 --> 04:45:30,740
Oh, no.

4763
04:45:30,860 --> 04:45:32,180
There isn't a live guy down there.

4764
04:45:46,280 --> 04:45:47,780
That's just... Unless he's dead.

4765
04:45:48,040 --> 04:45:48,740
Actually, I can't tell.

4766
04:45:50,380 --> 04:45:51,280
Oh, he's moving.

4767
04:45:52,040 --> 04:45:52,680
Just ignore him.

4768
04:45:53,880 --> 04:45:54,160
Oh, yeah.

4769
04:45:54,240 --> 04:45:55,800
This makes her kick and turn.

4770
04:46:05,800 --> 04:46:07,540
I already searched there.

4771
04:46:08,000 --> 04:46:08,860
I need a bird!

4772
04:46:13,250 --> 04:46:13,970
Oh, my God.

4773
04:46:14,150 --> 04:46:14,590
Big guy.

4774
04:46:15,230 --> 04:46:15,450
Wait.

4775
04:46:15,610 --> 04:46:16,730
I'll get me out of here, actually.

4776
04:46:17,050 --> 04:46:17,250
Wait.

4777
04:46:20,250 --> 04:46:21,630
because if I go outside

4778
04:46:33,680 --> 04:46:35,780
the elevators aren't working though

4779
04:46:41,590 --> 04:46:44,150
mysterious oh I didn't mean to pause the game itself

4780
04:46:48,790 --> 04:46:55,670
I don't remember where another bird was I guess I could go
back to the to the arcade so far from here

4781
04:47:13,650 --> 04:47:20,950
hint doko I don't remember where the other ones were um very
ponded I didn't have one.

4782
04:47:24,130 --> 04:47:26,510
Oh, the crow...

4783
04:47:26,510 --> 04:47:28,350
The crow country area had one.

4784
04:47:28,450 --> 04:47:28,890
That's right.

4785
04:47:29,010 --> 04:47:29,950
That's where the other one was.

4786
04:47:30,030 --> 04:47:31,070
Yeah, by the crow house.

4787
04:47:31,950 --> 04:47:32,970
We could go to that one.

4788
04:47:35,950 --> 04:47:37,770
I'll just have to sneak out of here.

4789
04:47:38,510 --> 04:47:42,030
And sneak through all of the mbade area, too.

4790
04:47:42,770 --> 04:47:43,990
Wait, this is hellish now.

4791
04:47:44,530 --> 04:47:45,350
Oh my god, he saw me.

4792
04:47:47,150 --> 04:47:47,970
This is hell.

4793
04:47:53,310 --> 04:47:55,870
I hope I'm going the right way!

4794
04:47:57,450 --> 04:47:59,090
I think I am.

4795
04:47:59,230 --> 04:47:59,490
Cool.

4796
04:48:06,490 --> 04:48:07,510
Okay, don't trust the purple.

4797
04:48:08,270 --> 04:48:09,190
Tell me my fortune!

4798
04:48:13,160 --> 04:48:14,240
Yes, tell me my fortune.

4799
04:48:17,240 --> 04:48:20,000
The periphery elevator switch is in Tolman's office.

4800
04:48:21,700 --> 04:48:22,580
Which is where?

4801
04:48:23,540 --> 04:48:24,500
Toby's office!

4802
04:48:26,120 --> 04:48:27,000
Where is that?

4803
04:48:31,380 --> 04:48:32,240
Where is he?

4804
04:48:35,200 --> 04:48:36,800
Try to burn the storage door.

4805
04:48:36,980 --> 04:48:38,860
That's what I think, yeah, we have to do that.

4806
04:48:39,100 --> 04:48:39,300
Ouch!

4807
04:48:39,460 --> 04:48:40,260
Oh my god!

4808
04:48:41,940 --> 04:48:43,060
Okay, I'm okay still.

4809
04:48:45,060 --> 04:48:45,760
What the?

4810
04:48:46,320 --> 04:48:47,700
Where did that come from?

4811
04:48:50,420 --> 04:48:51,640
Oh my god.

4812
04:48:52,060 --> 04:48:53,420
Wait, let's go into here real quick.

4813
04:48:54,460 --> 04:48:55,380
And then regret it?

4814
04:48:55,580 --> 04:48:59,580
and go back out, and then get my bearings, and...

4815
04:49:02,480 --> 04:49:02,640
Here?

4816
04:49:03,040 --> 04:49:04,520
Wait, no, that's the control room.

4817
04:49:06,780 --> 04:49:07,220
Um...

4818
04:49:07,220 --> 04:49:07,920
Leave me alone.

4819
04:49:08,740 --> 04:49:10,200
It was... Oh, shoot.

4820
04:49:11,300 --> 04:49:12,580
It was like...

4821
04:49:15,740 --> 04:49:17,260
I think it was on the other side.

4822
04:49:17,720 --> 04:49:18,560
All lost.

4823

4832
04:50:18,020 --> 04:50:18,440

Thank you guys so much, also, for helping me.

4837

Holy cow.

4844
04:50:46,400 --> 04:50:47,740
There's, like, no health left.

4845
04:50:47,920 --> 04:50:48,780
I'm dying here.

4846
04:50:50,000 --> 04:50:50,960
It's the red square.

4847
04:50:51,140 --> 04:50:51,340
What?

4848
04:50:51,940 --> 04:50:52,620
Where is that?

4849
04:50:53,040 --> 04:50:53,760
What am I looking at?

4850
04:50:53,840 --> 04:50:54,000

Correct.

4864
04:51:51,500 --> 04:51:53,440

4865
04:51:55,180 --> 04:51:56,720
What's root excavation?

4866
04:51:57,460 --> 04:51:58,020
No idea.

4867
04:51:59,240 --> 04:52:00,400
You know, you're not being very helpful.

4868
04:52:03,720 --> 04:52:04,440
I like his room.

4869
04:52:05,420 --> 04:52:06,100
This thing's pretty cool.

4870
04:52:06,220 --> 04:52:06,660
I'm jealous.

4871
04:52:08,640 --> 04:52:09,280
I'm jealous.

4872
04:52:09,420 --> 04:52:10,240
We could play some.

4873
04:52:10,700 --> 04:52:10,700
Okay.

4874
04:52:11,420 --> 04:52:11,580
Cool.

4875
04:52:12,600 --> 04:52:13,360
Metal cabinet.

4876
04:52:13,620 --> 04:52:14,180
Music note.

4877
04:52:15,540 --> 04:52:15,900
What's this?

4878
04:52:15,960 --> 04:52:18,480
Oh, this is for the elevators.

4879
04:52:19,440 --> 04:52:20,460
The lights are all red.

4880
04:52:22,540 --> 04:52:23,400
This is a little guy.

4881
04:52:23,880 --> 04:52:24,940
Piece of Tuesday.

4882
04:52:25,620 --> 04:52:26,700
Isolated for examination.

4883
04:52:29,360 --> 04:52:30,640
You have antidote, but no.

4884
04:52:31,300 --> 04:52:33,100
No, I don't need any more antidote.

4885
04:52:33,300 --> 04:52:34,100
I need health.

4886
04:52:35,600 --> 04:52:37,480
Oh, I need health, please.

4887
04:52:38,060 --> 04:52:38,320
Please.

4888
04:52:43,040 --> 04:52:50,460
Tollman's records Guests are appearing almost every day now
We can't save them They're too far gone But I want to know

4889
04:52:50,460 --> 04:52:59,140
where they've come from I found a number marked in blood on
the ground 2106 We've seen that twice now It's not a code

4890
04:52:59,140 --> 04:53:04,500
for any of our locks It's not a code at all Ha

4891
04:53:07,620 --> 04:53:12,640
The sound is horribly distorted Probably because the aerial
has been cut in half.

4892
04:53:13,100 --> 04:53:14,040
Yeah, that's terrible.

4893
04:53:18,690 --> 04:53:19,150
Alright, Tolman.

4894
04:53:19,530 --> 04:53:20,690
The park is closed.

4895
04:53:21,590 --> 04:53:21,590
Duh.

4896
04:53:21,970 --> 04:53:22,450
I know.

4897
04:53:24,650 --> 04:53:27,790
Search through garbage cans, even ones you've locked in
before.

4898
04:53:27,910 --> 04:53:28,690
You might find med kits.

4899
04:53:29,150 --> 04:53:29,630
Yeah, yeah.

4900
04:53:31,650 --> 04:53:32,650
So go home.

4901
04:53:33,110 --> 04:53:33,970
I can't go home.

4902
04:53:34,910 --> 04:53:35,530
Sure you could.

4903
04:53:35,770 --> 04:53:37,350
Just get in your little car and drive away.

4904
04:53:38,030 --> 04:53:39,810
I'm sure that guy you saved would appreciate it.

4905
04:53:41,050 --> 04:53:42,290
Arthur, you know about him.

4906
04:53:43,310 --> 04:53:51,290
the one who's been spying on us at least he had the good
sense to get injured once and give up just notice the total

4907
04:53:51,290 --> 04:54:00,950
number of keys on that such range yeah Tolman what are the
monsters the monsters don't pretend like you don't know what

4908
04:54:00,950 --> 04:54:11,510
I'm talking about no it's just trust me Mara you don't want
to know can I turn on the elevators from in here the

4909
04:54:11,510 --> 04:54:14,070
elevators are broken No, they're not.

4910
04:54:14,210 --> 04:54:15,470
They're just pretending to be broken.

4911
04:54:16,850 --> 04:54:17,730
So where's the switch?

4912
04:54:18,990 --> 04:54:20,790
Let's see if you can work it out on your own.

4913
04:54:21,430 --> 04:54:21,670
Fine.

4914
04:54:23,350 --> 04:54:25,430
You don't feel like helping me find the elevator switch?

4915
04:54:26,510 --> 04:54:27,370
I do not.

4916
04:54:27,970 --> 04:54:28,190
Right.

4917
04:54:32,560 --> 04:54:33,640
Showing static.

4918
04:54:34,220 --> 04:54:35,200
Examine the tapes.

4919
04:54:35,860 --> 04:54:36,420
Hindenburg?

4920
04:54:36,920 --> 04:54:37,420
Titanic?

4921
04:54:38,000 --> 04:54:38,560
Plague!

4922
04:54:39,220 --> 04:54:39,780
Hiroshima!

4923
04:54:40,960 --> 04:54:41,480
Hiroshima!

4924
04:54:45,940 --> 04:54:48,660
A small flyer broke out in the port.

4925
04:54:50,300 --> 04:54:53,180
Okay, the- oh, the dates over there are- wait.

4926
04:54:56,690 --> 04:54:58,650
Up, wait, I wasn't paying attention.

4927
04:55:02,150 --> 04:55:03,810
One way- blah blah blah blah blah.

4928
04:55:06,370 --> 04:55:09,270
The dates are the same ones on the side here.

4929
04:55:09,890 --> 04:55:12,170
What footage do we have of the plague?

4930
04:55:14,950 --> 04:55:15,470
F.

4931
04:55:18,410 --> 04:55:20,010
Oh, it's for the keyboard.

4932
04:55:20,170 --> 04:55:21,090
Okay, so...

4933
04:55:21,450 --> 04:55:23,170
So F is first.

4934
04:55:26,310 --> 04:55:27,550
F is first.

4935
04:55:27,750 --> 04:55:30,630
The 1912 Titanic.

4936
04:55:33,910 --> 04:55:35,630
What was that?

4937
04:55:36,670 --> 04:55:36,990
A.

4938
04:55:37,450 --> 04:55:38,230
F-A.

4939
04:55:39,690 --> 04:55:40,610
F-A-C?

4940
04:55:43,150 --> 04:55:44,790
Sorry, I'm not reading it.

4941
04:55:48,620 --> 04:55:49,120
Oh, wait.

4942
04:55:49,360 --> 04:55:50,880
Oh, I didn't mean to do the Titanic.

4943
04:55:51,040 --> 04:55:51,220
Sorry.

4944
04:55:52,720 --> 04:55:53,060
Okay.

4945
04:55:54,380 --> 04:55:55,700
37 was what?

4946
04:55:57,580 --> 04:56:04,960
Yeah, the Hidden Memory Witch was C, and then Hiroshima is
F-A-C-E Face!

4947
04:56:13,700 --> 04:56:13,960
Ooh.

4948
04:56:14,620 --> 04:56:15,460
Whoa, synth.

4949
04:56:25,960 --> 04:56:28,160
I solved your stupid puzzle.

4950
04:56:29,340 --> 04:56:30,000
Be honest.

4951
04:56:30,520 --> 04:56:31,700
You loved it.

4952
04:56:31,900 --> 04:56:32,900
Ha ha ha ha.

4953
04:56:35,160 --> 04:56:35,820
Oh, okay.

4954
04:56:36,660 --> 04:56:37,360
That's it.

4955
04:56:38,660 --> 04:56:38,980
Okay.

4956
04:56:40,080 --> 04:56:40,880
Alright, guys.

4957
04:56:44,120 --> 04:56:44,680
Oh, wait.

4958
04:56:44,740 --> 04:56:45,740
There's one right outside.

4959
04:56:45,960 --> 04:56:46,460
That's right.

4960
04:56:46,620 --> 04:56:47,580
There's one right there.

4961
04:56:47,820 --> 04:56:48,340
We don't have to go.

4962
04:56:48,340 --> 04:56:54,520
I was thinking, oh my gosh, I'm going to have to go all the
way back to like the haunted area.

4963
04:56:54,760 --> 04:56:55,840
But no, we're okay.

4964
04:56:56,380 --> 04:56:57,000
We can go.

4965
04:56:57,800 --> 04:56:59,940
There's one in the delivery garage.

4966
04:57:00,900 --> 04:57:01,040
Okay.

4967
04:57:02,960 --> 04:57:03,360
Alright.

4968
04:57:04,600 --> 04:57:06,680
Let's heal before we...

4969
04:57:08,160 --> 04:57:10,740
I think I will do big.

4970
04:57:12,380 --> 04:57:12,620
Okay.

4971
04:57:14,880 --> 04:57:16,080
Mara, hold up.

4972
04:57:16,800 --> 04:57:17,400
What is it?

4973
04:57:18,200 --> 04:57:19,240
Don't go down there.

4974
04:57:19,840 --> 04:57:21,880
You'll regret it.

4975
04:57:22,580 --> 04:57:23,800
So be it.

4976
04:57:31,880 --> 04:57:32,420
Northwest.

4977
04:57:38,440 --> 04:57:40,280
You might want to start clearing up some monsters.

4978
04:57:40,460 --> 04:57:42,200
I think you're right, honestly.

4979
04:57:46,210 --> 04:57:46,770
Are there monsters?

4980
04:57:46,930 --> 04:57:47,730
I imagine there's probably some monsters.

4981
04:57:47,750 --> 04:57:48,030
sometimes.

4982
04:57:48,410 --> 04:57:49,070
Break room!

4983
04:57:51,150 --> 04:57:55,330
Oh, absolutely there are some big old monsters down here.

4984
04:58:01,740 --> 04:58:03,900
I wish I could aim well with this thing.

4985
04:58:10,710 --> 04:58:12,050
Oh, there's my pointer.

4986
04:58:12,650 --> 04:58:12,650
Oh,

4987
04:58:16,440 --> 04:58:18,120
there is a red can, you're right.

4988
04:58:19,000 --> 04:58:21,900
Let's just do that instead.

4989
04:58:26,990 --> 04:58:27,110
Oh,

4990
04:58:36,370 --> 04:58:36,670
come on.

4991
04:58:37,990 --> 04:58:39,270
Are you...

4992
04:58:39,270 --> 04:58:40,530
Are you made of steel?

4993
04:58:45,110 --> 04:58:47,230
No more new monster spawn now.

4994
04:58:47,530 --> 04:58:47,970
Oh yay!

4995
04:58:48,430 --> 04:58:49,910
Only the hardest bits left.

4996
04:58:51,870 --> 04:58:52,510
Uh...

4997
04:58:54,510 --> 04:58:55,150
Uh...

4998
04:58:55,150 --> 04:58:56,930
Holy cow.

4999
04:58:57,130 --> 04:58:57,930
Wait, I think...

5000
04:58:57,930 --> 04:58:58,090
Oh.

5001
04:58:59,570 --> 04:59:01,970
I can't tell if he's dead dead or not.

5002
04:59:03,250 --> 04:59:03,470
Oh!

5003
04:59:03,930 --> 04:59:05,730
He sunk through the...

5004
04:59:05,730 --> 04:59:06,790
It's kind of gnarly.

5005
04:59:14,820 --> 04:59:15,580
Okay.

5006
04:59:17,240 --> 04:59:17,860
Uh, run!

5007
04:59:19,620 --> 04:59:21,220
What's going on here?

5008
04:59:21,920 --> 04:59:24,480
Metal gate to the root...

5009
04:59:24,480 --> 04:59:25,380
Root fry!

5010
04:59:25,920 --> 04:59:27,500
I want to go to the break room.

5011
04:59:29,100 --> 04:59:29,560
Oh, yeah.

5012
04:59:31,180 --> 04:59:33,220
Don't fail in the break room.

5013
04:59:34,280 --> 04:59:34,900
Gnarly.

5014
04:59:36,220 --> 04:59:37,660
Everything's gnarly.

5015
04:59:37,920 --> 04:59:40,960
Gnarly, gnarly, gnarly, gnarly.

5016
04:59:41,980 --> 04:59:43,140
Gnarly, gnarly, gnarly.

5017
04:59:43,260 --> 04:59:43,780
gnarly.

5018
04:59:45,740 --> 04:59:46,900
Everything's gnarly.

5019
04:59:52,180 --> 04:59:53,340
Break room.

5020
04:59:53,640 --> 04:59:54,100
You think it...

5021
04:59:54,100 --> 04:59:54,940
Wait, how many bullets?

5022
04:59:55,800 --> 04:59:57,620
You think I...

5023
04:59:57,620 --> 04:59:59,720
What is in here?

5024
05:00:00,640 --> 05:00:01,720
No way there's nothing.

5025
05:00:01,920 --> 05:00:02,580
That's so rude.

5026
05:00:04,800 --> 05:00:08,640
You think there's actually breaks happening in here or...

5027
05:00:14,040 --> 05:00:14,460
Please.

5028
05:00:14,940 --> 05:00:15,220
Health.

5029
05:00:16,220 --> 05:00:17,380
The game hates me.

5030
05:00:17,900 --> 05:00:20,520
I haven't gotten anything in the trash can in forever!

5031
05:00:22,800 --> 05:00:23,920
Stuck in my head now.

5032
05:00:24,480 --> 05:00:24,480
Sorry!

5033
05:00:24,860 --> 05:00:25,660
Oh, here's a health health.

5034
05:00:27,420 --> 05:00:28,080
I'll take that.

5035
05:00:31,380 --> 05:00:32,580
Root access.

5036
05:00:33,940 --> 05:00:35,260
Guess I'll turn that on.

5037
05:00:37,560 --> 05:00:38,760
Will I turn green?

5038
05:00:39,000 --> 05:00:39,920
I guess that's it.

5039
05:00:40,680 --> 05:00:41,280
Oh,

5040
05:00:45,700 --> 05:00:46,900
this looks like a boss.

5041
05:00:47,740 --> 05:00:49,860
Okay, I'm gonna fire him!

5042
05:00:57,500 --> 05:00:58,440
Is that getting him?

5043
05:00:58,620 --> 05:00:59,340
Oh my god.

5044
05:01:04,960 --> 05:01:05,720
He's wiping?

5045
05:01:06,620 --> 05:01:07,200
Oh my god.

5046
05:01:08,400 --> 05:01:09,440
Oh, he's also pooping.

5047
05:01:10,320 --> 05:01:11,640
Ow, hold on.

5048
05:01:11,860 --> 05:01:13,720
Okay, this isn't working so well, I think maybe.

5049
05:01:17,600 --> 05:01:18,940
We're still okay though.

5050
05:01:19,340 --> 05:01:21,320
In terms of health, kind of, somehow.

5051
05:01:22,080 --> 05:01:24,480
Oh, shoot.

5052
05:01:27,740 --> 05:01:30,620
Oh, please, please, please look at him.

5053
05:01:31,000 --> 05:01:31,400
Ouch.

5054
05:01:32,380 --> 05:01:32,580
Okay.

5055
05:01:33,360 --> 05:01:33,880
Ouch to you.

5056
05:01:34,040 --> 05:01:34,740
Not to me.

5057
05:01:35,580 --> 05:01:36,160
And in the face.

5058
05:01:37,540 --> 05:01:38,200
And in the face.

5059
05:01:38,560 --> 05:01:39,300
Oh, I think I got him.

5060
05:01:39,500 --> 05:01:40,140
Okay, nice.

5061
05:01:46,610 --> 05:01:47,930
You don't have the flamethrower.

5062
05:01:48,090 --> 05:01:49,970
I know, I know I don't have the flamethrower upgrade.

5063
05:01:50,130 --> 05:01:51,030
I couldn't get it.

5064
05:01:52,510 --> 05:01:53,130
Wait, what's this?

5065
05:01:56,960 --> 05:01:58,460
It's an old license plate.

5066
05:02:00,380 --> 05:02:01,620
They are people.

5067
05:02:08,790 --> 05:02:10,790
Georgia 2663 Atlanta Falcons.

5068
05:02:11,350 --> 05:02:12,350
Good thing this didn't melt.

5069
05:02:15,510 --> 05:02:16,670
What do I mean by that?

5070
05:02:18,450 --> 05:02:20,310
I wasn't going to read this, the notice board.

5071
05:02:20,450 --> 05:02:22,430
I can't remember the code for the break room security gate.

5072
05:02:22,910 --> 05:02:25,470
I swear it has a 3, a 6, and a 2.

5073
05:02:25,910 --> 05:02:26,490
Another 6?

5074
05:02:26,770 --> 05:02:27,690
I can't remember the order.

5075
05:02:28,110 --> 05:02:30,650
I know we took the code from the old license plate, but it's
gone missing.

5076
05:02:33,310 --> 05:02:34,110
That timing!

5077
05:02:34,530 --> 05:02:35,370
is crazy.

5078
05:02:39,010 --> 05:02:40,230
Atlanta Falcons fan.

5079
05:02:40,370 --> 05:02:40,950
God help them.

5080
05:02:41,050 --> 05:02:41,590
Are they bad?

5081
05:02:41,730 --> 05:02:42,430
Is that a bad team?

5082
05:02:42,990 --> 05:02:44,490
A bunch of green metal tubes.

5083
05:02:44,750 --> 05:02:45,970
Looks like I'll have gold inside.

5084
05:02:47,350 --> 05:02:48,890
Wait, what do I need this for though?

5085
05:02:49,630 --> 05:02:50,030
2663?

5086
05:02:51,010 --> 05:02:52,110
Do I need it for this?

5087
05:02:56,670 --> 05:02:58,210
I didn't have to input a code.

5088
05:02:59,710 --> 05:03:00,790
Wait, what did they save it for?

5089
05:03:01,670 --> 05:03:03,010
Break room security gate.

5090
05:03:04,710 --> 05:03:06,050
I didn't have to put in anything.

5091
05:03:08,830 --> 05:03:12,410
You can watch five hours of YouTube about their tragic
history.

5092
05:03:14,630 --> 05:03:16,310
They're pretty meh.

5093
05:03:18,010 --> 05:03:19,310
Oh, here.

5094
05:03:19,490 --> 05:03:20,110
Oh, duh.

5095
05:03:20,670 --> 05:03:21,370
Okay, two...

5096
05:03:22,850 --> 05:03:25,870
There we go.

5097
05:03:26,850 --> 05:03:27,570
Ooh,

5098
05:03:36,890 --> 05:03:37,710
can I ride this?

5099
05:03:41,330 --> 05:03:41,770
Never.

5100
05:03:46,910 --> 05:03:47,430
Wee!

5101
05:03:54,010 --> 05:03:54,910
Okie dokie.

5102
05:03:55,610 --> 05:03:58,010
Well, I need a map of this area.

5103
05:03:59,250 --> 05:04:01,670
I'm gonna be so lost.

5104
05:04:04,090 --> 05:04:06,430
They've never won a Super Bowl!

5105
05:04:06,710 --> 05:04:08,150
Wait, that's pretty tragic.

5106
05:04:08,590 --> 05:04:09,450
Oops, oh my god.

5107
05:04:10,750 --> 05:04:11,530
Oh, oh my god.

5108
05:04:12,350 --> 05:04:13,750
Wait, I think I'm done for?

5109
05:04:14,230 --> 05:04:14,450
Goodbye!

5110
05:04:17,010 --> 05:04:19,010
noped out of existence.

5111
05:04:23,990 --> 05:04:26,430
Why didn't my hands hit him?

5112
05:04:29,150 --> 05:04:31,510
Okay, one more time.

5113
05:04:33,730 --> 05:04:35,790
Why didn't my hands hit him?

5114
05:04:36,230 --> 05:04:37,310
So rude.

5115
05:04:44,800 --> 05:04:46,460
Okay, we got him this time.

5116
05:04:47,040 --> 05:04:47,980
Team, we got him.

5117
05:04:55,980 --> 05:04:57,760
Okay, my hits do not hit him.

5118
05:04:58,360 --> 05:04:59,040
It's time to leave.

5119
05:04:59,480 --> 05:04:59,880
Oh, wait.

5120
05:05:00,560 --> 05:05:01,200
Can I go?

5121
05:05:01,300 --> 05:05:02,260
Okay, good, good.

5122
05:05:03,140 --> 05:05:04,240
Okay, what's over here?

5123
05:05:05,000 --> 05:05:05,460
Northeast.

5124
05:05:05,780 --> 05:05:06,160
Oh, okay.

5125
05:05:06,280 --> 05:05:07,180
I think that's an elevator.

5126
05:05:07,940 --> 05:05:08,280
Uh, you?

5127
05:05:08,840 --> 05:05:09,300
Nope.

5128
05:05:09,620 --> 05:05:10,140
Leave me alone.

5129
05:05:10,620 --> 05:05:10,640
Ouch!

5130
05:05:10,880 --> 05:05:11,740
Oh, you sucker.

5131
05:05:13,080 --> 05:05:14,000
Root sun.

5132
05:05:15,080 --> 05:05:17,560
Okay, and I'm just going in a pipe.

5133
05:05:18,020 --> 05:05:18,880
I'm just going anywhere.

5134
05:05:22,680 --> 05:05:24,880
I wasted all those bullets on that guy.

5135
05:05:25,980 --> 05:05:26,660
little silly.

5136
05:05:34,540 --> 05:05:36,520
I'm gonna try it.

5137
05:05:37,800 --> 05:05:39,040
Oh thank goodness.

5138
05:05:39,600 --> 05:05:40,620
It's actual ammo.

5139
05:05:41,920 --> 05:05:43,740
Not the purple kind that trick you.

5140
05:05:45,640 --> 05:05:46,600
It's a hatch.

5141
05:05:47,500 --> 05:05:48,840
I can't get into the pipe.

5142
05:05:49,000 --> 05:05:50,540
It looks like some kind of high-tech lock.

5143
05:05:52,520 --> 05:05:53,620
The display changed.

5144
05:05:56,460 --> 05:06:05,560
I love that we're just going in here and like pushing
buttons like we don't know what we're doing at all we're

5145
05:06:05,560 --> 05:06:18,000
just like la la la big giant valve i don't know what it does
let me just push the buttons it truly doesn't do anything

5146
05:06:18,000 --> 05:06:21,860
like what i have to find a different way into the central
area

5147
05:06:29,660 --> 05:06:33,560
took you down Oh my gosh.

5148
05:06:36,340 --> 05:06:37,980
These, like, ceiling traps?

5149
05:06:38,200 --> 05:06:39,100
Why are they in here?

5150
05:06:40,340 --> 05:06:42,460
Why are they in these areas, huh?

5151
05:06:47,220 --> 05:06:48,740
Ah, buttons, buttons!

5152
05:06:49,100 --> 05:06:49,900
Oh, it's this guy.

5153
05:06:50,540 --> 05:06:51,200
Oh, my God.

5154
05:06:51,340 --> 05:06:52,220
It's this spider guy.

5155
05:06:52,760 --> 05:06:53,400
Oh, my God.

5156
05:06:53,480 --> 05:06:54,260
Oh, he's so icky.

5157
05:06:55,120 --> 05:06:56,880
He has, like, his own BGM.

5158
05:06:57,000 --> 05:06:57,680
It's kind of crazy.

5159
05:06:58,640 --> 05:06:59,820
I think I can run past him.

5160
05:07:00,800 --> 05:07:01,500
Oh, ouch.

5161
05:07:02,720 --> 05:07:03,520
I can't get this over.

5162
05:07:07,560 --> 05:07:08,540
He's so bony.

5163
05:07:11,900 --> 05:07:12,260
Southwest.

5164
05:07:12,760 --> 05:07:13,780
I'm so lost.

5165
05:07:14,100 --> 05:07:14,860
Please, where's the map?

5166
05:07:16,660 --> 05:07:17,060
You know what?

5167
05:07:17,060 --> 05:07:19,820
I might have to just start going into one of these root
areas.

5168
05:07:20,480 --> 05:07:20,640
Oh.

5169
05:07:22,240 --> 05:07:22,600
Interesting.

5170
05:07:23,160 --> 05:07:23,780
It's a machine.

5171
05:07:24,020 --> 05:07:24,740
This is gross.

5172
05:07:25,540 --> 05:07:26,620
Why are you ignoring the roots?

5173
05:07:26,700 --> 05:07:28,720
I thought it was going to go into like a crazy area.

5174
05:07:28,840 --> 05:07:29,240
That's why.

5175
05:07:30,380 --> 05:07:31,900
What kind of machine is this anyway?

5176
05:07:32,400 --> 05:07:33,940
Maybe I could turn it on and see what it does.

5177
05:07:35,020 --> 05:07:35,980
Well there is a big old button.

5178
05:07:37,940 --> 05:07:40,760
Calibration Route 3 Tuesday, full of grace.

5179
05:07:46,600 --> 05:07:47,140
What did it do?

5180
05:07:47,580 --> 05:07:48,540
That was underwhelming.

5181
05:07:49,100 --> 05:07:50,680
Maybe if it's something in between the clamps.

5182
05:08:01,400 --> 05:08:03,600
Okay, I think I need to lower it a little bit.

5183
05:08:10,460 --> 05:08:11,260
Lower it?

5184
05:08:12,320 --> 05:08:13,420
Make it lower?

5185
05:08:14,020 --> 05:08:14,200
Oh!

5186
05:08:15,420 --> 05:08:16,140
What's this spell?

5187
05:08:29,160 --> 05:08:31,320
What comes up must come down.

5188
05:08:38,310 --> 05:08:38,930
Left lever?

5189
05:08:39,070 --> 05:08:40,590
No, this one controls the...

5190
05:08:40,590 --> 05:08:41,770
This one controls this thing.

5191
05:08:55,910 --> 05:08:56,930
We will come back.

5192
05:08:58,670 --> 05:09:01,010
I have a feeling I'm gonna have to, like, do this area.

5193
05:09:03,610 --> 05:09:05,570
I'm, like, worried about dying in here.

5194
05:09:09,670 --> 05:09:09,990
It's okay.

5195
05:09:10,070 --> 05:09:12,450
We'll go check out another real area and we can come back.

5196
05:09:14,910 --> 05:09:15,270
Health.

5197
05:09:15,750 --> 05:09:16,730
You are so mean.

5198
05:09:22,370 --> 05:09:23,550
The bird.

5199
05:09:26,630 --> 05:09:28,890
I'm just gonna shoot you too.

5200
05:09:31,820 --> 05:09:32,300
Wednesday.

5201
05:09:34,800 --> 05:09:36,820
Oh my god, it's a save point!

5202
05:09:38,760 --> 05:09:39,620
Let's go!

5203
05:09:43,820 --> 05:09:44,700
Uh...

5204
05:09:47,020 --> 05:09:47,920
Holy cow!

5205
05:09:48,240 --> 05:09:49,100
Okay.

5206
05:09:50,140 --> 05:09:51,020
A magazine.

5207
05:09:51,900 --> 05:09:53,280
Oh, here's all my tips and stuff.

5208
05:09:53,480 --> 05:09:54,040
My tips and tricks.

5209
05:09:54,300 --> 05:09:55,020
More ammo!

5210
05:09:55,500 --> 05:09:56,560
Is there any health in here?

5211
05:09:56,700 --> 05:09:57,000
Please!

5212
05:09:57,840 --> 05:09:58,240
Please!

5213
05:09:58,800 --> 05:10:00,140
Box of shotgun shells.

5214
05:10:01,380 --> 05:10:02,100
No health!

5215
05:10:02,760 --> 05:10:04,440
Why is the game so stingy all of a sudden?

5216
05:10:05,120 --> 05:10:07,480
Wait, is that a map?!

5217
05:10:08,320 --> 05:10:08,760
Where?

5218
05:10:08,860 --> 05:10:10,980
Oh my gosh, everything is coming up, Minto!

5219
05:10:13,980 --> 05:10:14,420
Okay.

5220
05:10:17,480 --> 05:10:17,920
Confusing.

5221
05:10:18,800 --> 05:10:18,860
Okay.

5222
05:10:19,100 --> 05:10:19,300
Okay.

5223
05:10:20,420 --> 05:10:23,000
Wednesday, save the day for real though.

5224
05:10:23,800 --> 05:10:26,620
What is this one?

5225
05:10:27,840 --> 05:10:31,200
Calibration Route 4, Wednesday, full of woe.

5226
05:10:33,320 --> 05:10:35,800
It's Friday, I'm in love!

5227
05:10:40,990 --> 05:10:42,570
Is that the...

5228
05:10:49,820 --> 05:10:51,780
Are these the roots?

5229
05:10:51,880 --> 05:10:54,120
Oh, that's how they harvest the gold!

5230
05:10:58,630 --> 05:11:00,930
The gold is, that's what fell earlier.

5231
05:11:02,170 --> 05:11:03,410
Gonna heal, by the way.

5232
05:11:12,490 --> 05:11:14,030
So these are the roots.

5233
05:11:14,850 --> 05:11:17,450
And they have the gold inside them like that.

5234
05:11:21,490 --> 05:11:22,450
Which way am I going?

5235
05:11:24,710 --> 05:11:25,190
South.

5236
05:11:28,580 --> 05:11:29,720
Oh, you're icky.

5237
05:11:30,080 --> 05:11:31,300
You're pretty creepy looking.

5238
05:11:32,100 --> 05:11:32,580
Wee!

5239
05:11:32,700 --> 05:11:33,940
Uh, no.

5240
05:11:34,860 --> 05:11:35,400
Little baby.

5241
05:11:35,780 --> 05:11:36,900
Oh my god, there's so many of you guys.

5242
05:11:37,120 --> 05:11:37,420
Wait!

5243
05:11:37,660 --> 05:11:40,140
Why is there a bicycle down here?

5244
05:11:42,970 --> 05:11:43,310
Ah!

5245
05:11:43,610 --> 05:11:46,010
Oh my god.

5246
05:11:46,690 --> 05:11:46,870
Please.

5247
05:11:53,030 --> 05:11:55,290
Underground is basically the fast travel area.

5248
05:11:55,730 --> 05:11:57,410
If you want to get rid of some of the enemies in the halls.

5249
05:11:58,070 --> 05:11:59,330
But do I need to go back upstairs?

5250
05:12:02,170 --> 05:12:03,670
Thank you, if it's not for your help.

5251
05:12:04,050 --> 05:12:05,750
The screen is cracked, but it still seems to work.

5252
05:12:06,770 --> 05:12:07,830
Slot for my disc.

5253
05:12:10,730 --> 05:12:11,530
Gas pressure.

5254
05:12:12,910 --> 05:12:15,990
Wait, I think this will get rid of the gas in...

5255
05:12:16,870 --> 05:12:17,270
The...

5256
05:12:17,270 --> 05:12:18,070
What's it called, area?

5257
05:12:23,380 --> 05:12:24,660
Thick, smelly fumes.

5258
05:12:26,360 --> 05:12:27,000
Pull it!

5259
05:12:28,300 --> 05:12:28,600
Oh.

5260
05:12:29,280 --> 05:12:32,880
Like, total gas pressure must be exactly 50 for successful
manual overdrive.

5261
05:12:33,100 --> 05:12:33,680
This will get it...

5262
05:12:33,680 --> 05:12:36,420
This will make it so that we can go into that one area.

5263
05:12:40,660 --> 05:12:42,420
That we couldn't in the mermaid zone.

5264
05:12:43,520 --> 05:12:45,100
Harrison, what are you doing?

5265
05:12:46,180 --> 05:12:47,280
It's not safe down here, you know?

5266
05:12:48,840 --> 05:12:49,820
Yeah, no, I know.

5267
05:12:50,020 --> 05:12:52,080
I got chased by some kind of creature, I think.

5268
05:12:52,480 --> 05:12:53,160
Did it touch you?

5269
05:12:53,720 --> 05:12:54,080
Did it?

5270
05:12:54,240 --> 05:12:55,620
No, no, I got away just about.

5271
05:12:56,320 --> 05:12:59,140
I ran in here to get out of the way, you know.

5272
05:13:00,240 --> 05:13:00,600
Right.

5273
05:13:00,900 --> 05:13:01,480
Good idea.

5274
05:13:02,380 --> 05:13:05,960
And there's this big gas vent, and I thought, okay, maybe I
could be of use.

5275
05:13:06,080 --> 05:13:07,060
Maybe I can turn this off.

5276
05:13:07,780 --> 05:13:08,720
Yeah, how's that going?

5277
05:13:09,400 --> 05:13:09,760
Bad.

5278
05:13:09,980 --> 05:13:10,900
I don't know how to do it.

5279
05:13:11,240 --> 05:13:12,640
I try, but it's too complicated.

5280
05:13:12,800 --> 05:13:21,420
don't get it it's okay I'm sure you can do it I'll help you
out okay I finally ran into Natalie oh my gosh where she

5281
05:13:21,420 --> 05:13:27,000
been how did that go weird she was acting

5282
05:13:30,300 --> 05:13:37,600
weird I think she might be ill she didn't seem to want to
talk to me oh she told me I should just go home Harrison

5283
05:13:37,600 --> 05:13:51,060
sorry but she's right you should I'm off to perform oh she
guides oh my gosh have fun how much more do I probably like

5284
05:13:51,060 --> 05:13:58,660
an hour ish of this game left probably hopefully if I can
get through these things you're not going to tell me what's

5285
05:13:58,660 --> 05:14:06,120
going on are you ideally no Mera I'm concerned for your for
your safety don't be

5286
05:14:10,270 --> 05:14:21,750
okay so we need a note on the gas levels to make the gas
wait it has to be 50 is that what it said okay guys lock in

5287
05:14:21,750 --> 05:14:30,690
all right okay I'm getting pulling out the calculator okay
I'm pulling out the calculator right now we're serious

5288
05:14:30,690 --> 05:14:45,830
business okay 18 plus 15 plus 4 wait plus 13 guys I I did it
first try.

5289
05:14:46,230 --> 05:14:46,230
Wait.

5290
05:14:47,530 --> 05:14:47,530
Wait.

5291
05:14:48,350 --> 05:14:48,510
Wait.

5292
05:14:48,670 --> 05:14:49,910
I was just kidding.

5293
05:15:00,970 --> 05:15:02,610
What was this one?

5294
05:15:03,130 --> 05:15:03,530
18?

5295
05:15:04,650 --> 05:15:04,750
15?

5296
05:15:06,390 --> 05:15:06,630
4?

5297
05:15:07,050 --> 05:15:07,450
13?

5298
05:15:24,290 --> 05:15:25,850
I was just kidding!

5299
05:15:26,510 --> 05:15:27,910
I was just picking numbers!

5300
05:15:36,130 --> 05:15:40,190
Now, outside, there is a elevator.

5301
05:15:43,850 --> 05:15:50,150
But I want to go to the root areas that I didn't go to
because I was, like, running away.

5302
05:15:55,350 --> 05:15:56,690
How did I do that?

5303
05:15:57,510 --> 05:15:58,870
Maji Tensai.

5304
05:15:59,890 --> 05:16:00,970
Yeah, I think so.

5305
05:16:04,190 --> 05:16:08,910
Tolman's records And she claims she can't math I can't
believe I just did that

5306
05:16:14,100 --> 05:16:22,320
Tenzai I am Tenzai I'm genius I finally turned off I finally
turned off the excavation machines Boss didn't give me

5307
05:16:22,320 --> 05:16:28,800
permission but didn't argue He's obsessed with the pool and
the guests He hasn't answered his phone in days She's done

5308
05:16:28,800 --> 05:16:36,720
it again Thank you guys I also think you do our good.

5309
05:16:38,620 --> 05:16:40,760
Not the first time you winged the puzzle first try.

5310
05:16:41,120 --> 05:16:43,960
Definitely the missed one was probably my most impressive
yet.

5311
05:16:44,940 --> 05:16:48,800
The missed one that I did first try, I don't think I will
ever top that.

5312
05:16:49,260 --> 05:16:53,000
The sheer number of possibilities.

5313
05:16:55,320 --> 05:16:57,600
It was like a 1 in 50 chance or something.

5314
05:16:57,760 --> 05:16:58,680
It was insane.

5315
05:17:01,980 --> 05:17:07,680
If you haven't watched the missed one, Yeah, I didn't even
know it was a puzzle.

5316
05:17:07,820 --> 05:17:08,500
I just clicked it.

5317
05:17:11,140 --> 05:17:11,980
One in 72.

5318
05:17:12,460 --> 05:17:13,400
My gosh.

5319
05:17:14,940 --> 05:17:16,240
There was an accident in the park.

5320
05:17:16,360 --> 05:17:17,640
Boss had to shut the place down.

5321
05:17:17,860 --> 05:17:18,880
I don't think he cares at all.

5322
05:17:21,760 --> 05:17:23,840
Friday, I'm in love.

5323
05:17:25,720 --> 05:17:26,980
Loving and giving.

5324
05:17:28,740 --> 05:17:29,040
How...

5325
05:17:29,040 --> 05:17:29,740
How...

5326
05:17:29,740 --> 05:17:31,920
What is this?

5327
05:17:32,420 --> 05:17:33,000
A large tank.

5328
05:17:33,780 --> 05:17:34,940
dripping out of the pipe.

5329
05:17:35,820 --> 05:17:37,340
The smell is almost unbearable.

5330
05:17:37,900 --> 05:17:40,060
Wait, we can fill our... Yeah, we can fill our thing.

5331
05:17:42,680 --> 05:17:44,680
And without your smarty glasses, too.

5332
05:17:45,040 --> 05:17:47,940
You guys, my gotcha luck has been kind of crazy lately.

5333
05:17:48,640 --> 05:17:50,680
Like, I think my luck is really turning around.

5334
05:17:55,180 --> 05:17:56,340
Should we turn it off?

5335
05:17:56,420 --> 05:17:57,620
It was dripping on this thing.

5336
05:17:58,060 --> 05:17:59,080
Shouldn't we let it keep dripping?

5337
05:18:09,600 --> 05:18:10,760
It's gonna slip out.

5338
05:18:20,420 --> 05:18:30,840
ammo take that it's being real stingy on health recently
though the game hates me okay uh let's see so we hit friday

5339
05:18:31,960 --> 05:18:36,950
i went all the way around and i didn't that's so my bad

5340
05:18:41,180 --> 05:18:46,140
oh my god uh let's see

5341
05:18:55,830 --> 05:18:58,370
i'm gonna search the trash camera one more time.

5342
05:18:58,770 --> 05:18:59,210
Just kidding.

5343
05:18:59,370 --> 05:19:00,510
I've already searched it.

5344
05:19:04,610 --> 05:19:07,330
I think that's a corpse below the acid valve.

5345
05:19:08,170 --> 05:19:11,070
It may hops very well be.

5346
05:19:11,870 --> 05:19:13,410
Is this the guy that I couldn't shoot?

5347
05:19:18,780 --> 05:19:21,540
Game's encouraging you to go boom boom, so true.

5348
05:19:22,280 --> 05:19:23,640
But I couldn't kill this guy.

5349
05:19:23,740 --> 05:19:24,300
I wouldn't let me.

5350
05:19:30,740 --> 05:19:33,660
I must Maybe he goes better with him.

5351
05:19:35,880 --> 05:19:36,840
Oh, there he goes.

5352
05:19:39,500 --> 05:19:40,300
Oh my god.

5353
05:19:40,920 --> 05:19:41,660
Oh, shoot.

5354
05:19:42,300 --> 05:19:42,420
Wait.

5355
05:19:43,420 --> 05:19:43,680
Goodbye.

5356
05:19:50,280 --> 05:19:51,360
He deflects it.

5357
05:19:51,400 --> 05:19:52,720
Yeah, he sounds metallic.

5358
05:19:55,140 --> 05:19:55,600
Um.

5359
05:19:56,300 --> 05:19:58,060
How many grenades do I have left?

5360
05:19:59,540 --> 05:20:00,060
One.

5361
05:20:01,260 --> 05:20:03,100
I don't know if there's...

5362
05:20:03,100 --> 05:20:04,980
I feel like this game will have...

5363
05:20:09,480 --> 05:20:11,180
The flamethrower might work.

5364
05:20:12,100 --> 05:20:12,500
Let's try that.

5365
05:20:12,620 --> 05:20:13,560
We can try that one instead.

5366
05:20:15,120 --> 05:20:16,560
I have to get kind of close to him, though.

5367
05:20:16,700 --> 05:20:18,020
And he's got large hands.

5368
05:20:18,340 --> 05:20:19,080
I'm going to try the grenade.

5369
05:20:19,380 --> 05:20:19,500
Wait.

5370
05:20:21,340 --> 05:20:22,820
Hey, I definitely reloaded.

5371
05:20:31,580 --> 05:20:31,980
Nice.

5372
05:20:33,680 --> 05:20:34,020
Yeah!

5373
05:20:34,660 --> 05:20:35,460
Take that.

5374
05:20:35,600 --> 05:20:36,500
Take that.

5375
05:20:37,120 --> 05:20:37,800
Route Saturday.

5376
05:20:39,780 --> 05:20:40,040
Oops.

5377
05:20:42,160 --> 05:20:43,660
Calibration Route 7 Saturday.

5378
05:20:43,740 --> 05:20:44,840
It works hard.

5379
05:20:46,840 --> 05:20:47,680
Another grenade!

5380
05:20:51,740 --> 05:20:56,260
I keep forgetting I have those these tanks, but I don't.

5381
05:20:56,980 --> 05:21:00,040
Oh, maybe the fuel tanks were for the flamethrower.

5382
05:21:00,240 --> 05:21:01,140
Now I think about it.

5383
05:21:01,320 --> 05:21:02,960
And not for like dropping on the ground.

5384
05:21:04,200 --> 05:21:04,660
Wait, I do!

5385
05:21:04,780 --> 05:21:06,100
They were magnum rounds.

5386
05:21:06,240 --> 05:21:07,200
The purple ones.

5387
05:21:08,760 --> 05:21:10,340
There's a revolver!

5388
05:21:13,200 --> 05:21:14,520
Wait, I We got another map?

5389
05:21:15,800 --> 05:21:15,840
Oh!

5390
05:21:26,100 --> 05:21:28,480
The top layer looks like it's supposed to be grass.

5391
05:21:29,300 --> 05:21:31,220
The bottom layer looks more like soil or rocks.

5392
05:21:32,720 --> 05:21:33,680
Wooden model.

5393
05:21:35,540 --> 05:21:36,120
Oh, whoops.

5394
05:21:37,140 --> 05:21:37,600
Good.

5395
05:21:38,880 --> 05:21:41,040
They really aren't giving me any health at all.

5396
05:21:41,120 --> 05:21:42,460
Do you even notice this?

5397
05:21:43,860 --> 05:21:44,960
Game says, nah.

5398
05:21:45,660 --> 05:21:46,640
You're done healing.

5399
05:21:50,020 --> 05:21:50,720
Is that supposed to...

5400
05:21:50,720 --> 05:21:51,080
Look!

5401
05:21:51,160 --> 05:21:51,980
There's little people!

5402
05:21:52,240 --> 05:21:53,540
Maybe that's the Oh, yeah.

5403
05:21:53,840 --> 05:21:55,140
And then the roots.

5404
05:22:03,720 --> 05:22:05,060
No heal, only shooty.

5405
05:22:06,080 --> 05:22:06,460
Truly.

5406
05:22:07,260 --> 05:22:08,060
That's what it's saying.

5407
05:22:10,700 --> 05:22:11,020
What's here?

5408
05:22:11,140 --> 05:22:11,680
What's this thing?

5409
05:22:13,420 --> 05:22:13,900
Oh, grenade.

5410
05:22:14,980 --> 05:22:15,460
Granade.

5411
05:22:20,050 --> 05:22:22,930
Okay, I do have to go back up to the mermaid area.

5412
05:22:24,990 --> 05:22:27,610
Which we don't quite know.

5413
05:22:29,350 --> 05:22:30,490
There's this other room here.

5414
05:22:30,510 --> 05:22:31,790
here I haven't gone into.

5415
05:22:32,690 --> 05:22:34,630
I don't quite know which...

5416
05:22:34,630 --> 05:22:36,510
Maybe southwest it would be.

5417
05:22:38,490 --> 05:22:39,090
That...

5418
05:22:39,090 --> 05:22:40,610
The southwest elevator.

5419
05:22:41,630 --> 05:22:41,910
Oh, whoops.

5420
05:22:48,070 --> 05:22:48,350
Gosh.

5421
05:22:48,870 --> 05:22:49,150
Please.

5422
05:22:49,530 --> 05:22:50,070
Look this way.

5423
05:22:50,470 --> 05:22:51,130
Where are you?

5424
05:22:59,480 --> 05:23:00,080
Uh...

5425
05:23:00,080 --> 05:23:00,440
Dookyo?

5426
05:23:03,700 --> 05:23:04,540
Oh my god.

5427
05:23:05,640 --> 05:23:07,560
I'm gonna switch to my shot.

5428
05:23:09,000 --> 05:23:09,600
Um...

5429
05:23:15,610 --> 05:23:16,590
Where are you?

5430
05:23:17,790 --> 05:23:18,790
Just start killing.

5431
05:23:20,290 --> 05:23:21,330
Time to start killing.

5432
05:23:21,990 --> 05:23:24,190
It does look like a slipknot member.

5433
05:23:25,590 --> 05:23:26,590
These guys are freaky.

5434
05:23:27,530 --> 05:23:28,350
These guys are pretty freaky.

5435
05:23:33,950 --> 05:23:35,430
I'm scared of taking this.

5436
05:23:35,510 --> 05:23:36,390
What if it explodes?

5437
05:23:37,210 --> 05:23:38,990
What if it explodes and I die?

5438
05:23:43,290 --> 05:23:44,530
I want to believe.

5439
05:23:45,710 --> 05:23:47,330
I want to believe that it's health.

5440
05:23:54,990 --> 05:23:56,070
Oh, oh my god.

5441
05:23:56,310 --> 05:23:58,330
not realize her hand.

5442
05:24:00,330 --> 05:24:02,250
I can't tell if it's bouncing off or not.

5443
05:24:05,330 --> 05:24:06,610
Risk it for the biscuit.

5444
05:24:07,450 --> 05:24:07,590
Woo!

5445
05:24:12,150 --> 05:24:15,290
I think I can only shoot it when it emerges.

5446
05:24:16,110 --> 05:24:17,150
I'm just going to run past.

5447
05:24:18,550 --> 05:24:18,610
Stop.

5448
05:24:23,200 --> 05:24:24,520
Was this Sunday?

5449
05:24:25,280 --> 05:24:26,320
What's going on in here?

5450
05:24:27,920 --> 05:24:29,800
Hey Ed, did she get my rock shipment?

5451
05:24:30,480 --> 05:24:31,380
Why don't you answer the phone?

5452
05:24:31,620 --> 05:24:32,560
What's going on over there?

5453
05:24:32,860 --> 05:24:33,300
Marv.

5454
05:24:36,500 --> 05:24:38,180
A real med kit.

5455
05:24:40,880 --> 05:24:41,720
We're okay!

5456
05:24:42,600 --> 05:24:44,240
We're okay for now.

5457
05:24:45,480 --> 05:24:46,520
We're okay for now.

5458
05:24:47,400 --> 05:24:49,000
It's a generator, it looks ancient.

5459
05:24:52,120 --> 05:24:53,600
I actually have no idea how to turn it off.

5460
05:24:54,180 --> 05:24:56,020
It looks fragile though, maybe I can just destroy it.

5461
05:24:58,700 --> 05:24:59,780
What was something...

5462
05:25:05,690 --> 05:25:08,210
Was there something that we needed to...

5463
05:25:08,210 --> 05:25:09,750
Turn the generator off for?

5464
05:25:10,510 --> 05:25:12,190
Preserved for posterity.

5465
05:25:13,170 --> 05:25:13,910
Route 1.

5466
05:25:15,290 --> 05:25:16,510
Yeah, surely that wasn't important.

5467
05:25:17,270 --> 05:25:19,510
I think Mara just thinks...

5468
05:25:19,510 --> 05:25:21,430
Or rather, she just does before she thinks.

5469
05:25:21,730 --> 05:25:22,830
She just...

5470
05:25:22,830 --> 05:25:24,510
She just does.

5471
05:25:27,210 --> 05:25:29,170
Check the map and look above.

5472
05:25:30,570 --> 05:25:31,530
Oh wait, I can!

5473
05:25:31,630 --> 05:25:31,910
Oh my god!

5474
05:25:31,930 --> 05:25:33,590
Oh gosh, I just realized that I can...

5475
05:25:33,590 --> 05:25:34,670
Wait, where are we now?

5476
05:25:35,290 --> 05:25:36,410
We're over there.

5477
05:25:40,280 --> 05:25:41,080
Crow's office.

5478
05:25:42,440 --> 05:25:43,220
Can we get in?

5479
05:25:46,240 --> 05:25:47,580
The electric door handle.

5480
05:25:47,680 --> 05:25:48,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5481
05:25:49,100 --> 05:25:50,020
She's kind of dumb.

5482
05:25:50,140 --> 05:25:51,400
At least she admitted it.

5483
05:25:52,520 --> 05:25:53,080
Good night.

5484
05:25:53,180 --> 05:25:54,820
If you're heading to bed, I'm sorry.

5485
05:25:55,280 --> 05:25:56,320
That, uh...

5486
05:25:56,320 --> 05:25:57,740
That, the game is a little bit...

5487
05:25:57,740 --> 05:25:58,440
Oh, come on.

5488
05:25:58,620 --> 05:25:59,440
That's no, no, no.

5489
05:25:59,900 --> 05:26:01,680
That game is a little longer, but...

5490
05:26:10,040 --> 05:26:10,600
done, I think.

5491
05:26:11,680 --> 05:26:15,320
Okay, this is, this is, uh, okay, we have not gone in here
either.

5492
05:26:15,960 --> 05:26:17,160
So we need to go into this route.

5493
05:26:18,920 --> 05:26:21,880
Oh, oh, oh, the girls are fighting.

5494
05:26:23,120 --> 05:26:24,640
Um, don't mind me.

5495
05:26:27,020 --> 05:26:28,060
Is there health in there?

5496
05:26:28,620 --> 05:26:29,020
Nothing.

5497
05:26:31,460 --> 05:26:33,520
Mr. Trumble, what are you doing down here?

5498
05:26:34,140 --> 05:26:35,320
Hey, kiddo, what's shaking?

5499
05:26:36,900 --> 05:26:38,420
You still, I'm still looking for Edward Crow.

5500
05:26:38,860 --> 05:26:46,440
Ah, ain't we all, ain't we all why are you looking for him
oh well how should i put this i just needed a little help

5501
05:26:46,440 --> 05:26:53,080

authorities there's

busybody why don't you make me tremble you loaded old gas

5504
05:27:14,220 --> 05:27:28,840
bag the girls are fighting so what happened in brazil the
question we're all asking what happened in brazil crow and i

5505
05:27:28,840 --> 05:27:41,680
were running a little operation see it was somewhat the
nature i guess you could say we were selling the gold right

5506
05:27:41,680 --> 05:27:46,060
the gold from the roots Oh, you've been reading up on me,
have you?

5507
05:27:53,360 --> 05:27:54,160
Close enough.

5508
05:27:56,320 --> 05:27:57,120
Like deceitful.

5509
05:27:57,380 --> 05:27:58,220
Okay, that's what I figured.

5510
05:27:58,740 --> 05:27:59,960
You can't pronounce it either?

5511
05:28:00,120 --> 05:28:01,140
I don't feel as bad then.

5512
05:28:01,740 --> 05:28:03,720
Why go all the way to Brazil to sell the gold?

5513
05:28:04,920 --> 05:28:06,400
It's like too much of a good thing.

5514
05:28:06,620 --> 05:28:07,140
You know what I mean?

5515
05:28:08,140 --> 05:28:08,420
No.

5516
05:28:09,140 --> 05:28:11,560
Well, you see, the gold we scooped out of the roots, right?

5517
05:28:11,900 --> 05:28:12,720
It's too pure.

5518
05:28:13,140 --> 05:28:14,040
And there's too much of it.

5519
05:28:14,240 --> 05:28:18,060
Why am I only thinking of breaking bad right now?

5520
05:28:18,860 --> 05:28:20,400
Do please sit us?

5521
05:28:20,760 --> 05:28:22,120
Do please sit us?

5522
05:28:22,600 --> 05:28:24,120
Do please sit on us?

5523
05:28:29,310 --> 05:28:29,790
Naughty!

5524
05:28:33,630 --> 05:28:36,130
My breaking brain rot right now.

5525
05:28:39,850 --> 05:28:41,090
Why is that a problem?

5526
05:28:41,710 --> 05:28:44,070
Crow didn't want anyone connecting the gold back to his
land.

5527
05:28:44,650 --> 05:28:45,470
He didn't want the U.S.

5528
05:28:45,630 --> 05:28:47,610
government and looking into where it was coming from.

5529
05:28:48,950 --> 05:28:51,950
I was telling the story, Tolman, you uppity old bastard.

5530
05:28:53,710 --> 05:28:58,390
Well, you were doing a shit job of it, Trumbull, you
worthless old junkie.

5531
05:29:00,430 --> 05:29:01,810
We gotta cook, Minto.

5532
05:29:03,470 --> 05:29:06,530
So at least before you got in trouble, you must have been
making a lot of money.

5533
05:29:06,690 --> 05:29:07,070
You and Crow?

5534
05:29:08,130 --> 05:29:09,190
You could say that.

5535
05:29:10,030 --> 05:29:11,490
Then why come back here at all?

5536
05:29:11,870 --> 05:29:13,990
Why not just go live on a desert island or something?

5537
05:29:15,950 --> 05:29:18,530
I wouldn't want to live on a desert island.

5538
05:29:18,710 --> 05:29:20,890
I would want to live on a deserted island.

5539
05:29:23,570 --> 05:29:27,330
You are wrong, this game's story is basically a breaking bad
tax evasion plot.

5540
05:29:27,450 --> 05:29:27,810
Yeah!

5541
05:29:32,030 --> 05:29:33,690
They yearn for the mines.

5542
05:29:36,030 --> 05:29:37,710
We be yearning here.

5543
05:29:38,970 --> 05:29:40,950
Bring back yearning and bring back mines.

5544
05:29:42,570 --> 05:29:43,090
Oh.

5545
05:29:45,850 --> 05:29:49,650
Let me tell you, I left stream early and never would have
expected the story to go to Brazil.

5546
05:29:50,010 --> 05:29:52,350
Okay, to be fair, though, Brazil was pretty early on.

5547
05:29:52,950 --> 05:29:54,190
How long have you been gone, huh?

5548
05:29:57,030 --> 05:29:59,550
They went and seized my assets, didn't they?

5549
05:29:59,830 --> 05:30:00,410
All of it.

5550
05:30:01,010 --> 05:30:03,150
It's all frozen unless I show my face in court.

5551
05:30:03,470 --> 05:30:05,130
Answer all their lovely questions.

5552
05:30:06,110 --> 05:30:08,130
You wanted to hide the gold in the vent in the babysitter?

5553
05:30:10,690 --> 05:30:12,110
I understand that.

5554
05:30:12,550 --> 05:30:13,810
It was too large.

5555
05:30:15,850 --> 05:30:16,870
But let me guess.

5556
05:30:17,370 --> 05:30:18,970
Crow kept his name off the paperwork.

5557
05:30:19,930 --> 05:30:21,430
So he gets to keep his share of the money.

5558
05:30:22,430 --> 05:30:25,690
Is that why you really came back to make sure Crow gets
dragged down with you?

5559
05:30:27,930 --> 05:30:29,690
She really sussed you out.

5560
05:30:29,990 --> 05:30:31,090
Only took her two minutes.

5561
05:30:32,530 --> 05:30:34,950
Quit your cackling, Tolman, you arrogant old snob.

5562
05:30:36,030 --> 05:30:36,870
I'll laugh at you all.

5563
05:30:36,910 --> 05:30:39,270
I like Trumble, you dopey old clown.

5564
05:30:39,710 --> 05:30:41,730
These guys are like an old married couple.

5565
05:30:44,630 --> 05:30:46,170
So, Mara, what do you make of them?

5566
05:30:46,770 --> 05:30:47,590
What do I make of what?

5567
05:30:48,250 --> 05:30:48,850
The roots.

5568
05:30:49,990 --> 05:30:51,030
The big green tubes?

5569
05:30:51,270 --> 05:30:52,110
Those are the roots?

5570
05:30:53,370 --> 05:30:54,270
Why are they called that?

5571
05:30:55,210 --> 05:30:56,530
That's just what Crow named them.

5572
05:30:57,330 --> 05:30:58,050
What are they made of?

5573
05:30:58,750 --> 05:31:00,330
The outer shell is mostly copper.

5574
05:31:01,170 --> 05:31:05,170
However, the inner core is 24 karat gold.

5575
05:31:06,290 --> 05:31:07,690
Pyrrhus there is.

5576
05:31:07,830 --> 05:31:09,670
Worst old divorced couple.

5577
05:31:10,330 --> 05:31:10,770
No!

5578
05:31:11,730 --> 05:31:13,490
May have been Phantom Secret number one.

5579
05:31:13,590 --> 05:31:15,550
She can't say prestigious.

5580
05:31:15,870 --> 05:31:17,610
I could say prestigious.

5581
05:31:18,770 --> 05:31:20,290
I could even say it with the accent.

5582
05:31:20,950 --> 05:31:21,350
Prestigious.

5583
05:31:22,390 --> 05:31:22,870
Prestigious.

5584
05:31:23,810 --> 05:31:26,130
That's not a secret to have that fact at all.

5585
05:31:26,270 --> 05:31:28,090
That's not a real fact at all.

5586
05:31:30,670 --> 05:31:32,670
As you well know, well, no.

5587
05:31:32,970 --> 05:31:34,150
Trumble, you...

5588
05:31:35,890 --> 05:31:36,370
Leech.

5589
05:31:37,090 --> 05:31:37,710
Shut it, Tolman.

5590
05:31:37,990 --> 05:31:39,190
You traitorous old Cretan.

5591
05:31:41,810 --> 05:31:45,290
All the machinery, the big circular saw, it's for...

5592
05:31:45,290 --> 05:31:46,810
It's made of labooboo.

5593
05:31:50,310 --> 05:31:52,230
We call it root excavation.

5594
05:31:52,330 --> 05:31:54,810
My stutter has been so bad recently, you guys.

5595
05:31:55,110 --> 05:31:55,850
I don't know why.

5596
05:31:57,630 --> 05:31:59,950
Although harvesting might be more of an accurate term.

5597
05:32:00,630 --> 05:32:03,690
The roots are cut into shorter segments, which are lifted up
to the surface.

5598
05:32:05,130 --> 05:32:06,690
All this just to extract the gold?

5599
05:32:07,430 --> 05:32:08,750
Correct the moon, though.

5600
05:32:09,670 --> 05:32:12,010
She wasn't talking to you, Trumble, you heinous old
parasite.

5601
05:32:13,290 --> 05:32:16,030
The roots are green and yellow, like the Brazilian flag!

5602
05:32:16,430 --> 05:32:17,590
Wait, you're so right!

5603
05:32:18,430 --> 05:32:20,890
The roots belong in Brazil!

5604
05:32:24,890 --> 05:32:28,330
Fight me, Tolman, you pompous old jackass!

5605
05:32:30,150 --> 05:32:31,730
Mara, you should really get out of here.

5606
05:32:32,130 --> 05:32:33,630
I can't leave now, I'm so close!

5607
05:32:34,150 --> 05:32:34,950
Close to what exactly?

5608
05:32:35,010 --> 05:32:36,670
That's what I'm wondering, close to what?

5609
05:32:37,690 --> 05:32:38,510
Do you even know?

5610
05:32:39,170 --> 05:32:40,690
Listen, I know you wanna...

5611
05:32:40,690 --> 05:32:42,630
Don't bother with the pep talk, she doesn't care.

5612
05:32:43,290 --> 05:32:45,390
Quiet down, Trumble, you greasy old half-wit.

5613
05:32:46,570 --> 05:32:48,130
Don't talk to me like that, Tolman.

5614
05:32:48,430 --> 05:32:51,290
You cantankerous old...

5615
05:32:52,590 --> 05:32:53,430
See, a sponge!

5616
05:32:54,510 --> 05:32:54,810
Okay.

5617
05:32:55,290 --> 05:32:56,310
I think we got through it.

5618
05:32:59,650 --> 05:33:00,550
Um, okay.

5619
05:33:01,170 --> 05:33:03,530
Before we do that, though...

5620
05:33:09,930 --> 05:33:12,290
I think we want to go up.

5621
05:33:15,960 --> 05:33:16,700
Oh, wait.

5622
05:33:16,740 --> 05:33:17,540
There's a central...

5623
05:33:17,560 --> 05:33:18,140
That's right.

5624
05:33:19,780 --> 05:33:20,860
This central thing.

5625
05:33:23,960 --> 05:33:24,700
This guy.

5626
05:33:25,360 --> 05:33:26,800
There's a pain in my side.

5627
05:33:27,140 --> 05:33:28,620
Let's see, how can I get rid of him?

5628
05:33:42,520 --> 05:33:43,900
Just like that!

5629
05:33:46,860 --> 05:33:47,540
Look!

5630
05:33:48,180 --> 05:33:50,460
It's not even health anymore!

5631
05:33:50,700 --> 05:33:51,680
It's bullets!

5632
05:33:52,980 --> 05:33:53,480
Evil.

5633
05:33:55,520 --> 05:33:56,200
Evil.

5634
05:33:59,860 --> 05:34:01,340
So we got rid of the gas.

5635
05:34:03,700 --> 05:34:05,540
And we got rid of the...

5636
05:34:07,340 --> 05:34:08,680
The door here.

5637
05:34:09,100 --> 05:34:10,420
So we can go in.

5638
05:34:11,240 --> 05:34:11,520
E.

5639
05:34:11,900 --> 05:34:11,900
L.

5640
05:34:12,140 --> 05:34:12,940
Crow owner.

5641
05:34:14,240 --> 05:34:14,760
It's locked.

5642
05:34:14,900 --> 05:34:16,280
There's a golden keyhole.

5643
05:34:16,960 --> 05:34:17,160
Shoot.

5644
05:34:21,240 --> 05:34:22,740
The throw-up is still there.

5645
05:34:22,900 --> 05:34:23,520
That's kind of crazy.

5646
05:34:29,030 --> 05:34:30,190
What can the acid be?

5647
05:34:30,190 --> 05:34:31,770
Oh, the acid is to be used...

5648
05:34:33,890 --> 05:34:34,370
Uh...

5649
05:34:39,300 --> 05:34:40,780
Oh, wait, what is this?

5650
05:34:41,820 --> 05:34:42,900
Oh, tank of gasoline!

5651
05:34:43,980 --> 05:34:45,720
I was like, wait a second, is that an item or no?

5652
05:34:46,380 --> 05:34:47,840
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I noticed that.

5653
05:34:48,760 --> 05:34:49,980
My eyes are so special.

5654
05:34:53,080 --> 05:34:54,840
Yeah, we refilled the acid bottle.

5655
05:34:54,940 --> 05:34:56,440
I guess we do use it on the bones, huh?

5656
05:34:59,780 --> 05:35:00,980
Let's get through here.

5657
05:35:04,180 --> 05:35:06,700
What would be the best way to get there then?

5658
05:35:10,040 --> 05:35:12,380
That gets us into the staff hallway.

5659
05:35:13,200 --> 05:35:18,380
I think the delivery garage is going to be where we want to
go because we want to get to the...

5660
05:35:19,300 --> 05:35:20,860
That gassy area.

5661
05:35:23,320 --> 05:35:25,520
That's... that's open now.

5662
05:35:27,940 --> 05:35:28,220
Yeah.

5663
05:35:31,920 --> 05:35:34,920
All these areas should be cleared out, which is pretty nice.

5664
05:35:36,500 --> 05:35:36,840
Run!

5665
05:35:37,380 --> 05:35:43,030
I have specialization.

5666
05:35:43,050 --> 05:35:46,690
eyes okay

5667
05:35:52,180 --> 05:36:05,460
oh yeah this is where oh yeah and the central thing here too
oh this is a baby i gotta be careful though uh

5668
05:36:09,520 --> 05:36:28,020
shoot the baby oh shoot oh okay he's hiding again peekaboo
all right I got rid of some of the annoying guys.

5669
05:36:31,780 --> 05:36:34,840
Hopefully there's not too many things in this garage room.

5670
05:36:35,360 --> 05:36:36,800
Because we haven't been in here before.

5671
05:36:39,800 --> 05:36:40,500
Was that thing moving?

5672
05:36:40,840 --> 05:36:41,300
Oh, shoot.

5673
05:36:41,960 --> 05:36:42,480
Oh, gosh.

5674
05:36:43,400 --> 05:36:44,300
I don't like that.

5675
05:36:57,080 --> 05:36:58,220
What do we got in here?

5676
05:36:59,840 --> 05:37:00,940
What the heck is this?

5677
05:37:02,380 --> 05:37:02,820
Battery?

5678
05:37:03,140 --> 05:37:03,840
Hi, battery.

5679
05:37:04,120 --> 05:37:04,880
Crow walk.

5680
05:37:07,840 --> 05:37:08,800
Some more bullets.

5681
05:37:10,760 --> 05:37:14,240
I saw that there was a sign over here, too, but I'm scared
to go by the box.

5682
05:37:16,620 --> 05:37:19,840
I'm scared to go by the box.

5683
05:37:20,300 --> 05:37:22,180
I wish I could have, I should have saved, honestly.

5684
05:37:23,540 --> 05:37:24,200
Is it too late?

5685
05:37:24,940 --> 05:37:25,180
Wait.

5686
05:37:25,500 --> 05:37:26,940
Oh, there's more bullets back there, too.

5687
05:37:29,220 --> 05:37:29,760
Trash can.

5688
05:37:29,900 --> 05:37:30,400
Oh, you're right.

5689
05:37:35,120 --> 05:37:36,760
Oh, lucky winner.

5690
05:37:40,280 --> 05:37:41,510
There's something in there, too.

5691
05:37:47,970 --> 05:37:50,570
Wait, this was not open before.

5692
05:37:51,770 --> 05:37:53,550
Like, it was...

5693
05:37:58,010 --> 05:37:59,470
It was shut.

5694
05:38:00,790 --> 05:38:02,570
The opposite of open.

5695
05:38:04,130 --> 05:38:06,630
I noticed there's an elevator behind the large crow.

5696
05:38:07,870 --> 05:38:08,690
Does it go anywhere?

5697
05:38:08,870 --> 05:38:09,690
Does anyone use it?

5698
05:38:09,730 --> 05:38:10,990
It always seems to be powered down.

5699
05:38:11,130 --> 05:38:11,670
I figured it was broken.

5700
05:38:11,850 --> 05:38:13,530
That's probably into the central area, no?

5701
05:38:14,330 --> 05:38:17,290
Someone said there's a switch in the crow's office that
turns it on.

5702
05:38:17,550 --> 05:38:17,770
Ah!

5703
05:38:20,330 --> 05:38:21,130
I see.

5704
05:38:29,800 --> 05:38:31,660
More shotgun shells, I'll take it.

5705
05:38:32,160 --> 05:38:34,460
Wait, this is not real, is it?

5706
05:38:35,080 --> 05:38:35,800
Is this real?

5707
05:38:37,120 --> 05:38:38,080
You think it's real?

5708
05:38:39,620 --> 05:38:41,320
Just a bunch of flickering numbers.

5709
05:38:41,780 --> 05:38:42,660
Can't make sense of it.

5710
05:38:49,800 --> 05:38:54,520
dumpster whatever's in there is on fire smells bad it's
giving me a headache

5711
05:38:59,200 --> 05:39:08,280
that's a tank of gasoline yeah it doesn't look real there's
a this thing at the bottom that it looks like wait it looks

05:39:54,790 --> 05:39:56,210
battery charged.

5716
05:39:56,670 --> 05:39:57,290
What an ordeal.

5717
05:40:03,630 --> 05:40:05,970
It's all of our stuff that we've done.

5718
05:40:09,170 --> 05:40:11,790
Some kind of diagram that I'm taking a photo of.

5719
05:40:21,300 --> 05:40:22,700
It's from Brazil.

5720
05:40:26,580 --> 05:40:27,640
Check the box.

5721
05:40:31,980 --> 05:40:33,120
It's from Brazil.

5722
05:40:38,860 --> 05:40:40,020
Maybe I shouldn't.

5723
05:40:45,530 --> 05:40:45,890
Julie!

5724
05:40:47,590 --> 05:40:48,150
Hey, kid.

5725
05:40:48,910 --> 05:40:49,970
Julie, what happened?

5726
05:40:51,130 --> 05:40:53,110
I'll tell you, if you help me out of this thing.

5727
05:40:53,810 --> 05:40:54,290
Okay.

5728
05:40:56,850 --> 05:40:58,210
Oh, my god.

5729
05:41:03,480 --> 05:41:06,380
She should have said something with her voice.

5730
05:41:09,360 --> 05:41:10,440
Thanks for the help.

5731
05:41:11,000 --> 05:41:12,320
How did you end up in the crate?

5732
05:41:12,860 --> 05:41:15,500
Some guy grabbed me from behind and threw me in there.

5733
05:41:16,480 --> 05:41:17,780
He came up behind you?

5734
05:41:19,200 --> 05:41:20,240
Some guy, who was it?

5735
05:41:20,540 --> 05:41:21,840
No idea, didn't see his face.

5736
05:41:22,300 --> 05:41:24,380
He had real sweaty hands, though.

5737
05:41:24,520 --> 05:41:25,060
Oh, no.

5738
05:41:25,480 --> 05:41:26,380
He's nervous.

5739
05:41:27,620 --> 05:41:28,260
Oh, gross.

5740
05:41:29,300 --> 05:41:32,260
Yeah, not an especially enjoyable experience, all told.

5741
05:41:33,500 --> 05:41:34,620
I wonder if it was Marvin.

5742
05:41:34,780 --> 05:41:36,480
He looked like he'd been kind of sweaty.

5743
05:41:40,340 --> 05:41:41,060
Marvin, who?

5744
05:41:41,360 --> 05:41:42,000
The Martian.

5745
05:41:42,640 --> 05:41:45,840
That's my favorite Looney Tunes character, you guys, is
Marvin the Martian.

5746
05:41:46,200 --> 05:41:49,320
I'm actually, I'm actually kind of really obsessed with him.

5747
05:41:57,010 --> 05:42:00,170
Oh, nothing.

5748
05:42:00,290 --> 05:42:00,630
Don't worry.

5749
05:42:00,710 --> 05:42:01,610
Just think it out loud.

5750
05:42:03,650 --> 05:42:06,930
He's probably one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my
entire afterlife.

5751
05:42:07,210 --> 05:42:08,230
I love him so much.

5752
05:42:09,430 --> 05:42:10,850
He's so cute.

5753
05:42:13,510 --> 05:42:19,090
I watched Space Jam just for him, but I'm afraid of the
Tasmanian devil, so I would close my eyes whenever he was on

5754
05:42:19,090 --> 05:42:19,590
the screen.

5755
05:42:19,930 --> 05:42:21,870
But if Marvin the Martian was on the screen...

5756
05:42:23,050 --> 05:42:24,710
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking!

5757
05:42:31,400 --> 05:42:32,520
I'm glad you're safe.

5758
05:42:32,980 --> 05:42:34,860
Yeah, listen, that's twice you've helped me out now.

5759
05:42:35,340 --> 05:42:36,860
Let me know if there's any way I can return the favor.

5760
05:42:37,000 --> 05:42:37,960
You could heal me.

5761
05:42:39,560 --> 05:42:40,640
Anything I can do for you?

5762
05:42:41,200 --> 05:42:41,680
All right, now.

5763
05:42:41,760 --> 05:42:42,160
Thanks, though.

5764
05:42:42,340 --> 05:42:44,220
Wait, no, that's not true at all.

5765
05:42:45,240 --> 05:42:47,820
You could get me health or something.

5766
05:42:49,360 --> 05:42:49,800
Okay.

5767
05:42:50,960 --> 05:42:51,400
Alright.

5768
05:42:51,900 --> 05:42:54,580
We came up here to go into...

5769
05:42:55,640 --> 05:42:56,080
Okay.

5770
05:42:56,280 --> 05:42:57,420
I want to save so bad.

5771
05:42:58,100 --> 05:42:59,740
Let's go into the submarine and save.

5772
05:43:00,700 --> 05:43:01,540
Is there anything in there?

5773
05:43:02,920 --> 05:43:03,200
No.

5774
05:43:03,880 --> 05:43:04,280
Alright.

5775
05:43:04,360 --> 05:43:06,100
We're going to do our best to save in the submarine.

5776
05:43:12,000 --> 05:43:13,280
What gun do I have?

5777
05:43:13,900 --> 05:43:14,440
This guy.

5778
05:43:21,120 --> 05:43:21,420
Oh.

5779
05:43:21,560 --> 05:43:22,280
Where are you going?

5780
05:43:22,740 --> 05:43:23,260
No, please.

5781
05:43:24,120 --> 05:43:25,320
Don't walk away from me.

5782
05:43:30,580 --> 05:43:32,960
Why is there an arrow pointing at the extinguisher?

5783
05:43:34,220 --> 05:43:35,040
I didn't see that.

5784
05:43:39,640 --> 05:43:41,700
He ran away so fast!

5785
05:43:45,350 --> 05:43:46,380
Okay, I think I can make it.

5786
05:43:49,370 --> 05:43:49,690
Okay.

5787
05:43:51,210 --> 05:43:52,290
Holy moly.

5788
05:43:53,290 --> 05:43:53,490
Okay.

5789
05:43:54,830 --> 05:43:58,230
I'm looking to see if any health items respond.

5790
05:43:58,490 --> 05:43:59,330
Unfortunately, no.

5791
05:44:00,170 --> 05:44:00,910
But we can heal.

5792
05:44:01,330 --> 05:44:01,570
All right.

5793
05:44:01,650 --> 05:44:03,650
Save and that's all that matters to me.

5794
05:44:06,990 --> 05:44:08,090
Hey Minto and Aibus.

5795
05:44:08,510 --> 05:44:08,910
Hello!

5796
05:44:11,390 --> 05:44:12,790
Hello, hello, hello!

5797
05:44:13,730 --> 05:44:15,030
Okay, go up.

5798
05:44:17,610 --> 05:44:19,970
Yeah, we find safety in the submarine.

5799
05:44:22,050 --> 05:44:22,630
Oh my god.

5800
05:44:22,950 --> 05:44:23,350
Wait a second.

5801
05:44:23,890 --> 05:44:24,430
Don't do that.

5802
05:44:24,530 --> 05:44:25,230
Are you coming over here?

5803
05:44:25,490 --> 05:44:26,610
Oh, okay, I'm gonna go down.

5804
05:44:27,830 --> 05:44:29,830
All right, we're gonna- we're just gonna run for it.

5805
05:44:34,500 --> 05:44:35,020
Uh...

5806
05:44:35,020 --> 05:44:36,040
Where was it, though?

5807
05:44:36,240 --> 05:44:36,980
Oh, in here.

5808
05:44:42,120 --> 05:44:43,160
It's a...

5809
05:44:43,160 --> 05:44:43,900
No way!

5810
05:44:44,380 --> 05:44:45,960
No kidding, is this our first ride?

5811
05:44:47,240 --> 05:44:48,740
We found one!

5812
05:44:51,840 --> 05:44:53,480
We found a ride!

5813
05:44:55,220 --> 05:44:56,160
It's a wheel.

5814
05:44:56,420 --> 05:44:57,520
I could turn it left or right.

5815
05:44:58,480 --> 05:44:59,420
Doesn't do anything.

5816
05:44:59,640 --> 05:45:00,560
But it's a nice feeling.

5817
05:45:00,820 --> 05:45:02,800
Having the horizon stretching out in front of you.

5818
05:45:04,300 --> 05:45:04,820
She's...

5819
05:45:05,380 --> 05:45:06,860
She's reliving a past life.

5820
05:45:06,880 --> 05:45:07,320
life.

5821
05:45:09,400 --> 05:45:10,280
Is there a treasure in here?

5822
05:45:12,820 --> 05:45:13,280
It's fake.

5823
05:45:13,400 --> 05:45:14,280
Of course it doesn't open.

5824
05:45:14,720 --> 05:45:16,600
I'm feeling a very tangible sense of betrayal.

5825
05:45:17,240 --> 05:45:18,060
Yeah, I am too.

5826
05:45:19,560 --> 05:45:21,140
I wish there was a fourth one.

5827
05:45:27,720 --> 05:45:28,120
Okay.

5828
05:45:28,880 --> 05:45:31,520
Should we sit in the front row or should we sit in the back
row?

5829
05:45:31,760 --> 05:45:33,200
How intense do you think this is?

5830
05:45:33,260 --> 05:45:35,440
It looks like a dark ride, so probably not so intense.

5831
05:45:36,900 --> 05:45:37,160
Wait.

5832
05:45:37,840 --> 05:45:41,540
The water's flowing this way, so I guess the third row would
be the first row?

5833
05:45:44,160 --> 05:45:46,100
Well, you finally found a ride!

5834
05:45:47,380 --> 05:45:48,760
Marvin was a great character.

5835
05:45:48,900 --> 05:45:53,580
The shame is appearing apprentice Marcia only appeared once
in Tiny Toons.

5836
05:45:53,780 --> 05:45:55,440
Oh, you're... Wait, I don't know Marcia.

5837
05:45:56,520 --> 05:45:57,240
That's the end of your year.

5838
05:45:57,300 --> 05:45:58,440
It's turning out to be a relaxing one.

5839
05:45:58,860 --> 05:45:59,820
Thank you, Hal Roth.

5840
05:45:59,900 --> 05:46:00,460
You too!

5841
05:46:02,680 --> 05:46:03,640
Let's go...

5842
05:46:03,640 --> 05:46:05,140
Let's go for one...

5843
05:46:05,140 --> 05:46:08,120
Wait, definitely one is the last row, though.

5844
05:46:08,180 --> 05:46:09,620
So we have to ride three.

5845
05:46:14,870 --> 05:46:15,750
It's the boat.

5846
05:46:16,070 --> 05:46:17,730
If I'm going to sit in it, I should sit in the middle.

5847
05:46:18,990 --> 05:46:20,370
Wait, where's the...

5848
05:46:20,370 --> 05:46:21,490
How do we get up there?

5849
05:46:25,610 --> 05:46:28,070
How do I get up there?

5850
05:46:32,510 --> 05:46:34,890
I think there's a...

5851
05:46:34,890 --> 05:46:35,710
Oh my gosh.

5852
05:46:46,090 --> 05:46:47,670
We'll have a golden keyhole!

5853
05:46:51,540 --> 05:46:52,320
Dang it.

5854
05:46:52,660 --> 05:46:54,080
This game hates me, for real.

5855
05:46:56,080 --> 05:46:57,960
Oh, now you're coming this way, huh?

5856
05:47:00,500 --> 05:47:01,360
Oh, please.

5857
05:47:01,920 --> 05:47:02,140
Please.

5858
05:47:02,820 --> 05:47:03,240
Oh, my God.

5859
05:47:07,440 --> 05:47:08,760
They're pretty fast, these guys.

5860
05:47:12,400 --> 05:47:12,860
Oh, boy.

5861
05:47:13,140 --> 05:47:13,760
I forgot he explodes.

5862
05:47:13,960 --> 05:47:14,480
Oh, my God.

5863
05:47:21,160 --> 05:47:22,400
Some antidote, though.

5864
05:47:22,520 --> 05:47:23,680
I can't carry it.

5865
05:47:25,720 --> 05:47:26,980
Oh, the door!

5866
05:47:27,260 --> 05:47:28,820
They said, like...

5867
05:47:29,600 --> 05:47:31,820
I wonder if we can just...

5868
05:47:32,340 --> 05:47:32,780
No.

5869
05:47:39,230 --> 05:47:40,730
I don't have a key.

5870
05:47:45,040 --> 05:47:46,180
Let's go through here.

5871
05:47:46,700 --> 05:47:48,440
Maybe I ride the ride and see what happens.

5872
05:47:50,400 --> 05:47:52,440
It's not like I'm just trying to ride the ride or anything.

5873
05:47:57,240 --> 05:48:00,220
This is fun, but I can't operate the ride controls from
here.

5874
05:48:00,740 --> 05:48:00,760
Oh.

5875
05:48:01,820 --> 05:48:02,260
Okay.

5876
05:48:05,820 --> 05:48:06,260
Alright.

5877
05:48:08,300 --> 05:48:09,740
Okay, I'm trying to think of

5878
05:48:18,260 --> 05:48:22,200
Okay, what are we working on?

5879
05:48:22,420 --> 05:48:25,040
We have this What is the theater?

5880
05:48:26,580 --> 05:48:27,240
Okay, hold on.

5881
05:48:27,760 --> 05:48:29,520
I'm trying to think of everything that we did downstairs.

5882
05:48:29,760 --> 05:48:30,560
We turned off the...

5883
05:48:30,560 --> 05:48:31,380
We got the acid.

5884
05:48:31,960 --> 05:48:40,520
So we can go To the toilet And get that It's...

5885
05:48:40,520 --> 05:48:41,320
That's what I'm suiting.

5886
05:48:43,740 --> 05:48:44,400
The bones.

5887
05:48:45,060 --> 05:48:47,740
But the bones has nothing to do with the theater, I don't
think.

5888
05:48:52,620 --> 05:48:54,340
How do I fast travel to the theater?

5889
05:48:54,620 --> 05:48:56,780
Oh, um, we could do that.

5890
05:48:57,660 --> 05:48:59,340
Chow was saying about a gold key in the theater.

5891
05:48:59,500 --> 05:48:59,980
Oh, really?

5892
05:49:04,110 --> 05:49:04,510
Okay.

5893
05:49:06,750 --> 05:49:13,250
That door in Ocean Kingdom, I'm pretty sure that's the door
that they said was able to be, like, That they were like,

5894
05:49:13,590 --> 05:49:14,930
please fix it or whatever.

5895
05:49:15,990 --> 05:49:16,970
Tariya, welcome back.

5896
05:49:17,350 --> 05:49:17,870
Thank you.

5897
05:49:18,250 --> 05:49:19,450
Theater is most important right now.

5898
05:49:19,610 --> 05:49:20,030
Okay, okay.

5899
05:49:21,050 --> 05:49:22,130
All right, all right, all right.

5900
05:49:26,360 --> 05:49:28,060
Then I shout, where am I?

5901
05:49:28,600 --> 05:49:29,140
A mosh.

5902
05:49:29,400 --> 05:49:31,280
Oh, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

5903
05:49:32,920 --> 05:49:35,140
Do I have everything to solve the theater?

5904
05:49:35,300 --> 05:49:37,220
Because I'm so confused by it.

5905
05:49:38,260 --> 05:49:39,320
Oh, I can talk to you.

5906
05:49:39,620 --> 05:49:40,320
Anything I can do?

5907
05:49:40,960 --> 05:49:41,440
Ask for help.

5908
05:49:41,540 --> 05:49:42,000
Is there something?

5909
05:49:42,300 --> 05:49:44,040
Oh, I need to get through the boat ride.

5910
05:49:44,320 --> 05:49:44,760
Oh!

5911
05:49:45,260 --> 05:49:47,080
Wait, I can ask her to help me!

5912
05:49:47,640 --> 05:49:48,200
The Seven Seas?

5913
05:49:48,460 --> 05:49:50,360
Yes, I can use your help to operate the controls.

5914
05:49:51,500 --> 05:49:52,800
Have you opened the door to the control room?

5915
05:49:53,200 --> 05:49:53,720
Not yet.

5916
05:49:54,040 --> 05:49:55,040
You'll need the golden key.

5917
05:49:55,660 --> 05:49:58,780
I remember reading a memo that mentioned it was over by the
fairy tale town theater.

5918
05:49:59,300 --> 05:50:01,520
Once you get the control door open, come back here and let
me know.

5919
05:50:02,060 --> 05:50:03,060
I'd be happy to help you.

5920
05:50:03,600 --> 05:50:04,140
Thanks, Julie.

5921
05:50:11,040 --> 05:50:15,220
I saw a certain other VTuber rotate gravestones for an hour
in this.

5922
05:50:21,800 --> 05:50:22,920
Totally understandable.

5923
05:50:23,960 --> 05:50:27,060
Oh, he's gone.

5924
05:50:27,340 --> 05:50:28,340
He didn't take his bike.

5925
05:50:30,800 --> 05:50:32,440
I think he's Mr. Sweaty.

5926
05:50:36,760 --> 05:50:38,180
Yeah, Julie was actually helpful.

5927
05:50:38,540 --> 05:50:44,180
It's a miracle to have a character that is actually helping
you.

5928
05:50:46,040 --> 05:50:47,180
Where does this one go to?

5929
05:50:47,540 --> 05:50:49,480
This one goes to...

5930
05:50:49,480 --> 05:50:51,000
The back rooms.

5931
05:50:57,320 --> 05:50:59,600
That's the other one.

5932
05:51:01,540 --> 05:51:02,620
With random.

5933
05:51:16,860 --> 05:51:17,380
This one.

5934
05:51:19,220 --> 05:51:21,240
I think I'm making time though.

5935
05:51:22,220 --> 05:51:23,380
I think basically...

5936
05:51:23,380 --> 05:51:27,940
I think how long to beat said that most people take about
six hours.

5937
05:51:29,180 --> 05:51:30,500
I think I'm making time.

5938
05:51:31,120 --> 05:51:32,080
Which is not so bad.

5939
05:51:32,560 --> 05:51:33,560
We run?

5940
05:51:36,900 --> 05:51:37,820
Wicked Wham!

5941
05:51:39,160 --> 05:51:40,820
Mint Phantom MF.

5942
05:51:41,000 --> 05:51:41,740
Flip it around.

5943
05:51:42,620 --> 05:51:43,200
Wicked Wham!

5944
05:51:43,860 --> 05:51:46,120
Okay, this thing...

5945
05:51:46,120 --> 05:51:47,900
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do here.

5946
05:51:52,010 --> 05:51:59,170
Yeah, the storage room door, I'm pretty sure, is this red
door in Ocean Kingdom on the right side.

5947
05:52:00,670 --> 05:52:03,210
But I haven't been able to get to it because of that big
guy.

5948
05:52:06,850 --> 05:52:10,090
Am I supposed to like fill this with acid and then it drips
on her?

5949
05:52:10,670 --> 05:52:11,970
That's the only thing I can think of.

5950
05:52:16,290 --> 05:52:18,490
Wait, isn't there another big guy in here?

5951
05:52:24,120 --> 05:52:25,140
Isn't there a big guy in here?

5952
05:52:26,580 --> 05:52:27,460
Hey, big guy.

5953
05:52:28,980 --> 05:52:30,020
Hey, big guy.

5954
05:52:30,360 --> 05:52:31,280
Oh yeah, there he is.

5955
05:52:31,500 --> 05:52:32,480
Wait, don't go, don't leave.

5956
05:52:34,780 --> 05:52:35,200
Oh my god.

5957
05:52:35,480 --> 05:52:35,920
Ah, shoot.

5958
05:52:38,340 --> 05:52:38,900
Where'd he go?

5959
05:52:39,720 --> 05:52:40,620
Oh my god, please.

5960
05:52:42,840 --> 05:52:43,960
Got his butt.

5961
05:52:47,350 --> 05:52:48,950
It gets me every time.

5962
05:52:50,510 --> 05:52:52,650
I think there's a baby over here too.

5963
05:52:58,550 --> 05:53:00,530
There's a sound effect that I hear.

5964
05:53:00,970 --> 05:53:02,150
I'm going to turn it up.

5965
05:53:03,650 --> 05:53:05,410
I think it's these guys.

5966
05:53:06,910 --> 05:53:16,510
There's like this one TikTok of like this person that is
like in a class so basically okay i'm going to explain it

5967
05:53:16,510 --> 05:53:27,830
right now it's so funny there's a professor that it's like
back when there was um online school or whatever during the

5968
05:53:27,830 --> 05:53:35,630
pandemic and the professor was like is there does anyone
have any questions and the person has like this alien voice

5969
05:53:35,630 --> 05:53:44,830
filter on that goes as like and you can tell that they're
asking like a genuine question You know that one?

5970
05:53:45,570 --> 05:53:46,210
So funny.

5971
05:53:46,450 --> 05:53:50,570
And then he's like, yeah, I really understood that.

5972
05:53:50,650 --> 05:53:51,750
Wait, did I show you guys?

5973
05:53:53,990 --> 05:53:59,410
The sound effect that I'm hearing in my ear sounds exactly
like it.

5974
05:54:02,530 --> 05:54:03,650
Sounds exactly...

5975
05:54:06,530 --> 05:54:07,090
Okay.

5976
05:54:07,690 --> 05:54:08,990
Oh, maybe it went a little overboard.

5977
05:54:09,730 --> 05:54:10,850
It's so funny.

5978
05:54:10,990 --> 05:54:12,210
It gets me every time.

5979
05:54:15,170 --> 05:54:17,570
I think I have to put the acid in here.

5980
05:54:20,870 --> 05:54:23,450
So the bone acid is optional.

5981
05:54:27,690 --> 05:54:29,250
Oh my gosh, we're going to dissolve her.

5982
05:54:30,410 --> 05:54:31,870
Goodbye, giant fairy lady.

5983
05:54:35,910 --> 05:54:36,950
Oh, I'm...

5984
05:54:43,630 --> 05:54:45,150
Sure is taking her time.

5985
05:54:51,020 --> 05:54:52,640
Yeah, you can refill the acid.

5986
05:54:55,460 --> 05:54:57,940
The acid has no effect on the fairy's wooden head.

5987
05:55:00,060 --> 05:55:01,680
Maybe there's something else I need to do first.

5988
05:55:02,320 --> 05:55:03,760
No stinking way.

5989
05:55:08,570 --> 05:55:09,450
No way.

5990
05:55:11,250 --> 05:55:11,470
Did

5991
05:55:14,560 --> 05:55:17,360
I just waste the acid and I have to go get another one?

5992
05:55:20,740 --> 05:55:21,220
Flamethrower.

5993
05:55:21,660 --> 05:55:22,700
Oh, she's wooden.

5994
05:56:12,920 --> 05:56:14,680
Are you sad?

5995
05:56:17,160 --> 05:56:18,460
Yeah, she's basically the other way.

5996
05:56:23,680 --> 05:56:25,500
Yeah, she's magical.

5997
05:56:26,040 --> 05:56:26,680
What's happening?

5998
05:56:28,660 --> 05:56:29,540
Thought that would work.

5999
05:56:29,700 --> 05:56:30,080
Me too.

6000
05:56:30,480 --> 05:56:31,540
I thought so for sure.

6001
05:56:34,040 --> 05:56:35,840
I don't want to waste my flamethrower.

6002
05:56:36,420 --> 05:56:37,420
I don't want to waste my flamethrower.

6003
05:56:42,160 --> 05:56:44,570
Oh my god, this game really hates me.

6004
05:56:49,450 --> 05:56:50,370
Oh, more bullets.

6005
05:56:52,770 --> 05:56:54,250
I will take that, though.

6006
05:56:55,150 --> 05:56:55,790
Definitely need that.

6007
05:56:57,810 --> 05:56:58,870
Little baby.

6008
05:57:06,730 --> 05:57:10,330
At this point, I'm just looking for more items that I hadn't
looted yet.

6009
05:57:15,350 --> 05:57:20,270
I'm not sure at all Why are you magical?

6010
05:57:20,570 --> 05:57:21,470
Why are you magical?

6011
05:57:32,840 --> 05:57:36,800
Nobody can Nobody Nobody can survive a headshot

6012
05:57:41,120 --> 05:57:42,240
Golden key

6013
05:57:46,180 --> 05:57:47,860
Wait, did that get all of it?

6014
05:57:48,040 --> 05:57:48,840
No, I don't think so

6015
05:57:52,240 --> 05:57:53,120
Keep going.

6016
05:57:53,920 --> 05:57:54,660
Actually, I think we're good.

6017
05:57:54,920 --> 05:57:55,320
Okay, no.

6018
05:57:56,020 --> 05:57:56,560
Yeah, we're fine.

6019
05:57:56,860 --> 05:57:57,200
We're fine.

6020
05:58:05,710 --> 05:58:06,750
That should be enough.

6021
05:58:07,030 --> 05:58:07,850
Take it.

6022
05:58:08,570 --> 05:58:09,090
Still stuck.

6023
05:58:11,930 --> 05:58:12,590
Golden key.

6024
05:58:12,730 --> 05:58:13,730
It's the fairy.

6025
05:58:15,150 --> 05:58:15,790
It's done.

6026
05:58:15,870 --> 05:58:17,290
I don't feel good about it.

6027
05:58:17,790 --> 05:58:18,050
Aw.

6028
05:58:18,930 --> 05:58:21,270
I know, because the fairy helped us earlier.

6029
05:58:22,690 --> 05:58:23,690
I don't want to hurt her.

6030
05:58:25,810 --> 05:58:27,150
Oh, I already checked this one.

6031
05:58:29,550 --> 05:58:30,810
I'm sorry.

6032
05:58:31,210 --> 05:58:31,210
Ouch!

6033
05:58:31,550 --> 05:58:32,050
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

6034
05:58:34,570 --> 05:58:34,870
Please.

6035
05:58:37,530 --> 05:58:38,230
Use item!

6036
05:58:44,280 --> 05:58:45,060
It's time.

6037
05:58:47,940 --> 05:58:49,360
The phone is ringing here, too.

6038
05:58:53,970 --> 05:58:54,630
No.

6039
05:58:55,070 --> 05:58:55,750
No way.

6040
05:58:56,590 --> 05:58:57,630
So many medkits.

6041
05:59:01,230 --> 05:59:03,050
I'll leave the rest of the people...

6042
05:59:03,050 --> 05:59:03,410
No.

6043
05:59:03,910 --> 05:59:05,890
No, it's not time to be...

6044
05:59:09,590 --> 05:59:11,190
There's like only us!

6045
05:59:14,970 --> 05:59:17,870
Moshi Moshi, you know, I never had a plan for all the gold.

6046
05:59:18,550 --> 05:59:20,470
In fact, it quickly became a problem.

6047
05:59:22,590 --> 05:59:23,830
We couldn't sell it, basically.

6048
05:59:24,350 --> 05:59:25,570
Not without arousing.

6049
05:59:26,410 --> 05:59:28,150
A lot of unwinted attention.

6050
05:59:28,430 --> 05:59:29,130
Oh, la la.

6051
05:59:30,910 --> 05:59:33,350
We had too much of it too quickly in the shape.

6052
05:59:33,650 --> 05:59:34,270
Those cylinders?

6053
05:59:34,870 --> 05:59:35,910
Well, it's not the normal process.

6054
05:59:35,930 --> 05:59:36,770
process, is it?

6055
05:59:37,790 --> 05:59:38,770
But then I had an idea.

6056
05:59:39,250 --> 05:59:40,530
What if it was the normal process?

6057
05:59:41,030 --> 05:59:43,090
Or what if we pretended it was?

6058
05:59:44,870 --> 05:59:46,310
What other people, Mara?

6059
05:59:46,770 --> 05:59:46,930
No!

6060
05:59:48,570 --> 05:59:50,770
So Marvin and I devised a plan.

6061
05:59:51,330 --> 05:59:52,410
We just needed a site.

6062
05:59:52,850 --> 05:59:54,290
A disused gold mine.

6063
05:59:54,830 --> 05:59:57,150
Mara found one in South America, in Brazil.

6064
05:59:57,870 --> 05:59:58,430
And you know what?

6065
05:59:58,930 --> 05:59:59,590
It worked.

6066
06:00:00,470 --> 06:00:01,790
For a while, at least.

6067
06:00:03,970 --> 06:00:04,790
He's gone.

6068
06:00:05,930 --> 06:00:07,230
No, Mara, please.

6069
06:00:07,490 --> 06:00:08,490
Mara, please.

6070
06:00:08,750 --> 06:00:09,970
You need them.

6071
06:00:10,570 --> 06:00:10,570
You.

6072
06:00:12,110 --> 06:00:12,110
You.

6073
06:00:12,290 --> 06:00:14,210
You need it.

6074
06:00:18,960 --> 06:00:21,140
We got a big old door right here.

6075
06:00:21,400 --> 06:00:21,760
What's this?

6076
06:00:23,140 --> 06:00:29,500
Emory University in recognition of the completion of the
prescribed course of study, Edward L.

6077
06:00:29,520 --> 06:00:33,340
Crowe has been admitted to the degree of biochemistry.

6078
06:00:33,600 --> 06:00:35,360
This really is just breaking bad.

6079
06:00:37,780 --> 06:00:38,520
Breaking bad!

6080
06:00:40,120 --> 06:00:41,940
Hey Ed, we didn't pass the inspection.

6081
06:00:42,540 --> 06:00:44,080
They figured out the ore is homemade.

6082
06:00:44,600 --> 06:00:47,540
The Brazilian authorities want to know where the gold is
really coming from.

6083
06:00:48,700 --> 06:00:49,620
This is getting too dangerous.

6084
06:00:50,020 --> 06:00:50,900
I'm coming back to Georgia.

6085
06:00:51,320 --> 06:00:52,520
See you soon, Marv.

6086
06:00:54,700 --> 06:00:56,320
He's coming back home.

6087
06:00:57,360 --> 06:00:59,420
Control room elevator switch number code.

6088
06:01:01,620 --> 06:01:05,060
My first is in Gruner, but also in Goblin.

6089
06:01:05,460 --> 06:01:07,760
My second is in Guest, but not.

6090
06:01:07,780 --> 06:01:19,280
in puddle or spindle my third is in lumber and goblin but
not in puddle my fourth is notable but only its absence okay

6091
06:01:19,280 --> 06:01:27,740
I figured we have to turn this on to figure it out who the
heck is this she's quite beautiful it's made entirely of

6092
06:01:27,740 --> 06:01:36,560
gold he made a gold anime figure oh oh no it's his mom I
mean his wife Jacqueline crawl.

6093
06:01:37,400 --> 06:01:38,740
Beloved wife and mother.

6094
06:01:41,400 --> 06:01:42,140
But it moves.

6095
06:01:44,180 --> 06:01:44,780
Sorry.

6096
06:01:48,860 --> 06:01:50,740
There's something strange about the frame.

6097
06:01:54,350 --> 06:01:55,570
It's a photograph.

6098
06:01:59,530 --> 06:02:01,210
What's that in there, twitching?

6099
06:02:04,550 --> 06:02:05,630
Okay, hold on.

6100
06:02:06,170 --> 06:02:06,790
It's a television.

6101
06:02:06,910 --> 06:02:09,010
Every few moments, something flashes on the screen.

6102
06:02:10,170 --> 06:02:11,110
I wish it wouldn't.

6103
06:02:11,630 --> 06:02:12,610
Yeah, it's kind of creepy.

6104
06:02:15,370 --> 06:02:16,610
Did I search his trash?

6105
06:02:18,610 --> 06:02:20,630
A grenade in there!

6106
06:02:21,270 --> 06:02:22,350
Mr. What the heck?

6107
06:02:26,160 --> 06:02:27,660
Let's go behind here.

6108
06:02:30,360 --> 06:02:31,640
Oh, it's a little root.

6109
06:02:32,520 --> 06:02:33,080
Is this sun...

6110
06:02:33,080 --> 06:02:34,300
This must be Sunday, right?

6111
06:02:34,860 --> 06:02:35,780
I love a...

6112
06:02:35,780 --> 06:02:37,780
I would love a golden meen-tail figure.

6113
06:02:38,260 --> 06:02:41,940
He made a super We're a 24 karat gold waifu-fu.

6114
06:02:45,080 --> 06:02:46,560
Is that a grenade in the corner?

6115
06:02:47,420 --> 06:02:48,340
The cornerware.

6116
06:02:49,720 --> 06:02:54,480
There are some of the roots around, so it might be a little
tricky to tell if it's a grenade.

6117
06:02:55,840 --> 06:02:56,540
Or root.

6118
06:02:56,880 --> 06:02:57,180
Oh, wait!

6119
06:02:58,020 --> 06:02:58,480
Oh, my gosh.

6120
06:02:58,580 --> 06:02:59,660
Murphy, your eyes.

6121
06:03:01,440 --> 06:03:01,920
Crazy.

6122
06:03:03,240 --> 06:03:03,660
Whoa!

6123
06:03:04,360 --> 06:03:05,840
Where the hell did you come from?

6124
06:03:14,710 --> 06:03:15,350
218.

6125
06:03:25,690 --> 06:03:26,970
Woman jumpscare.

6126
06:03:28,690 --> 06:03:29,750
Squirming back and forth.

6127
06:03:30,190 --> 06:03:30,890
Is it alive?

6128
06:03:32,270 --> 06:03:33,050
Small notebook.

6129
06:03:34,910 --> 06:03:36,510
The Diary of Edward Crow.

6130
06:03:38,530 --> 06:03:39,570
Age ten and a half.

6131
06:03:40,390 --> 06:03:40,670
Saturday.

6132
06:03:41,030 --> 06:03:41,810
I am excited.

6133
06:03:42,490 --> 06:03:46,190
Tomorrow father and I are going camping in the Condor
country over the river.

6134
06:03:46,650 --> 06:03:49,850
Father says it's just a nickname, as there are no condors in
Georgia.

6135
06:03:50,430 --> 06:03:51,910
I am looking forward to the trip, nonetheless.

6136
06:03:52,350 --> 06:03:54,150
I love being outdoors at night.

6137
06:03:55,070 --> 06:03:55,410
Sunday.

6138
06:03:56,310 --> 06:03:57,910
Father and I found something strange while camping.

6139
06:03:58,250 --> 06:04:00,510
A green, shiny thing sticking out of the ground.

6140
06:04:00,930 --> 06:04:03,170
It is wriggling back and forth like a little bug.

6141
06:04:03,630 --> 06:04:06,830
But Father says it is not a bug, as it is made of metal.

6142
06:04:08,750 --> 06:04:10,250
Edward Crow, what is this made of?

6143
06:04:11,010 --> 06:04:11,370
Metal.

6144
06:04:15,780 --> 06:04:17,920
But there are condors in South America.

6145
06:04:17,920 --> 06:04:19,760
You got him there.

6146
06:04:20,760 --> 06:04:20,800
Monday.

6147
06:04:21,280 --> 06:04:22,880
We found a second wriggling metal thing.

6148
06:04:23,240 --> 06:04:25,220
A couple hundred feet south of the first one.

6149
06:04:25,780 --> 06:04:27,320
Father wanted to know what it is made of.

6150
06:04:27,680 --> 06:04:29,360
He cut off the tip with his camping knife.

6151
06:04:29,880 --> 06:04:30,860
Inside is a different metal.

6152
06:04:31,260 --> 06:04:32,360
It looks like gold.

6153
06:04:33,200 --> 06:04:33,560
Tuesday.

6154
06:04:33,880 --> 06:04:34,840
Two more shiny things.

6155
06:04:34,960 --> 06:04:35,480
Four in total.

6156
06:04:35,720 --> 06:04:37,200
Father says there may be more.

6157
06:04:37,960 --> 06:04:38,280
Wednesday.

6158
06:04:38,700 --> 06:04:40,360
Father bought Condor Country.

6159
06:04:40,700 --> 06:04:43,200
As well as a couple of acres on either side.

6160
06:04:43,660 --> 06:04:45,640
He said we could rename it if we wish.

6161
06:04:46,980 --> 06:04:47,400
Mm-hmm.

6162
06:04:48,320 --> 06:04:48,840
Oh!

6163
06:04:51,960 --> 06:04:52,260
Lucky.

6164
06:04:53,020 --> 06:04:53,560
Lucky, lucky.

6165
06:04:54,680 --> 06:04:55,860
My video game tips.

6166
06:04:58,820 --> 06:04:59,800
More antidote.

6167
06:05:01,940 --> 06:05:02,440
Okay, hold on.

6168
06:05:02,540 --> 06:05:03,820
I'm gonna save one more time.

6169
06:05:12,050 --> 06:05:12,630
Hi, Natalie.

6170
06:05:14,790 --> 06:05:15,190
Hold on.

6171
06:05:15,250 --> 06:05:16,090
I'm gonna spray my throat.

6172
06:05:17,510 --> 06:05:18,990
Sorry, I get tired of talking.

6173
06:05:22,070 --> 06:05:23,130
How are you feeling?

6174
06:05:23,250 --> 06:05:24,170
I can't believe I...

6175
06:05:24,190 --> 06:05:29,770
I have voiced two games for about six hours, two days in a
row.

6176
06:05:31,390 --> 06:05:32,390
Holy moly.

6177
06:05:34,410 --> 06:05:35,370
Did you have dinner yet?

6178
06:05:37,410 --> 06:05:37,810
No.

6179
06:05:38,250 --> 06:05:39,690
Well, I had like an early...

6180
06:05:39,690 --> 06:05:41,890
I had a late lunch, early dinner, so I'm okay.

6181
06:05:42,950 --> 06:05:43,590
How are you feeling?

6182
06:05:45,490 --> 06:05:46,350
Not great.

6183
06:05:47,070 --> 06:05:47,690
Yeah, me neither.

6184
06:05:49,450 --> 06:05:50,550
Is it your mother?

6185
06:05:51,330 --> 06:05:51,750
Yes.

6186
06:05:52,170 --> 06:05:53,530
She died some time ago.

6187
06:05:55,470 --> 06:06:05,010
I'm sorry it's a beautiful statue it's solid gold yeah it
must have been very expensive your dad really spared no

6188
06:06:05,010 --> 06:06:09,390

6189
06:06:09,470 --> 06:06:18,870

a pretty good idea where he is I just need to take the

6190
06:06:18,870 --> 06:06:26,490
central elevator Mara what are you going to do when you when
you find him I need to talk with him.

6191
06:06:27,810 --> 06:06:28,690
Are you going to kill him?

6192
06:06:29,470 --> 06:06:29,470
What?

6193
06:06:29,850 --> 06:06:30,790
No, of course not!

6194
06:06:32,090 --> 06:06:33,890
Don't think I don't see that gun in your hand.

6195
06:06:34,470 --> 06:06:36,390
Oh, I see it in your face too.

6196
06:06:37,170 --> 06:06:38,470
You've already made up your mind.

6197
06:06:43,480 --> 06:06:46,240
Natalie, I know he's done bad things, very bad things.

6198
06:06:46,600 --> 06:06:47,920
Perhaps he is beyond forgiveness.

6199
06:06:48,820 --> 06:06:49,900
Please don't kill him.

6200
06:06:51,020 --> 06:06:52,180
Bring him to me, okay?

6201
06:06:52,440 --> 06:06:53,360
Let me speak to him.

6202
06:06:54,060 --> 06:06:56,500
One way or another, today might be my last chance.

6203
06:06:59,640 --> 06:07:00,540
Please, Mara.

6204
06:07:01,540 --> 06:07:01,660
Okay.

6205
06:07:06,460 --> 06:07:07,420
Why don't you come with me?

6206
06:07:08,020 --> 06:07:08,200
No.

6207
06:07:09,060 --> 06:07:10,440
I don't want to know what's down there.

6208
06:07:10,940 --> 06:07:11,500
I'll wait here.

6209
06:07:13,400 --> 06:07:13,820
Oh, whoops.

6210
06:07:14,000 --> 06:07:14,300
My bad.

6211
06:07:16,640 --> 06:07:17,040
Alright.

6212
06:07:17,200 --> 06:07:17,360
Oh.

6213
06:07:18,320 --> 06:07:20,460
So the 9218...

6214
06:07:20,460 --> 06:07:21,280
Is that this code?

6215
06:07:21,420 --> 06:07:22,480
Because that would be really funny.

6216
06:07:25,220 --> 06:07:26,740
Oh, there is no code.

6217
06:07:32,940 --> 06:07:33,740
The lighting.

6218
06:07:33,760 --> 06:07:43,220

6222
06:08:06,480 --> 06:08:08,500
Yeah, it's really cool.

6223
06:08:09,200 --> 06:08:09,780
I'm jealous.

6224
06:08:10,160 --> 06:08:11,520
You got to go on a real adventure.

6225
06:08:12,360 --> 06:08:13,200
Arthur, how are you feeling?

6226
06:08:13,720 --> 06:08:14,480
Not great.

6227
06:08:15,060 --> 06:08:15,820
Just stay there, okay?

6228
06:08:16,540 --> 06:08:17,460
Mara, are you coming back?

6229
06:08:17,540 --> 06:08:18,280
Are we going to leave?

6230
06:08:18,380 --> 06:08:20,020
This poor man needs a hospital!

6231
06:08:23,500 --> 06:08:24,920
Sure, yeah, I'll be back soon.

6232
06:08:25,540 --> 06:08:26,160
Okay, good.

6233
06:08:29,820 --> 06:08:30,260
Um...

6234
06:08:30,260 --> 06:08:31,440
Wait, what was it?

6235
06:08:31,880 --> 06:08:33,740
Nine, two, one.

6236
06:08:33,760 --> 06:08:36,100
Oh, I did it.

6237
06:08:37,240 --> 06:08:38,240
There's a lever inside.

6238
06:08:38,580 --> 06:08:39,400
Oh, I pulled it.

6239
06:08:39,880 --> 06:08:40,500
Oh, bad.

6240
06:08:41,220 --> 06:08:43,540
Oh, I activated the central one.

6241
06:08:46,360 --> 06:08:47,560
All five lights are green.

6242
06:08:49,840 --> 06:08:51,780
It's a video feed from a security camera.

6243
06:08:52,000 --> 06:08:52,760
There's nothing there.

6244
06:08:54,180 --> 06:08:54,680
What is this?

6245
06:08:54,840 --> 06:08:54,940
Nothing.

6246
06:09:05,890 --> 06:09:06,450
Happy,

6247
06:09:13,160 --> 06:09:13,800
happy birthday!

6248
06:09:18,380 --> 06:09:20,800
That scared that the heck get out of me.

6249
06:09:24,460 --> 06:09:25,840
Oh my god.

6250
06:09:28,940 --> 06:09:30,100
Oh my god.

6251
06:09:30,940 --> 06:09:31,080
Okay.

6252
06:09:36,100 --> 06:09:38,660
I gotta reload it, but...

6253
06:09:49,490 --> 06:09:51,110
Uh, oh, please, please, please.

6254
06:09:53,930 --> 06:09:54,530
Oh my god.

6255
06:09:55,330 --> 06:09:56,270
This room is tiny.

6256
06:09:57,630 --> 06:09:58,550
Wait, is that countdown?

6257
06:10:06,070 --> 06:10:07,690
No, I think it's just numbers.

6258
06:10:08,230 --> 06:10:08,890
Just numbers.

6259
06:10:10,610 --> 06:10:12,510
Defeat all four optional...

6260
06:10:12,510 --> 06:10:13,190
Optional!

6261
06:10:13,710 --> 06:10:15,850
How are they optional mini-bosses?

6262
06:10:18,890 --> 06:10:20,050
How is that optional?

6263
06:10:21,010 --> 06:10:22,270
I couldn't leave.

6264
06:10:23,850 --> 06:10:25,650
One, two, three, four, five, six.

6265
06:10:27,690 --> 06:10:28,290
Oh, this thing?

6266
06:10:30,190 --> 06:10:30,870
Where is it?

6267
06:10:32,570 --> 06:10:33,250
What happened?

6268
06:10:33,450 --> 06:10:33,950
Is this green?

6269
06:10:34,530 --> 06:10:34,770
Where is it?

6270
06:10:36,550 --> 06:10:36,950
Wait.

6271
06:10:37,810 --> 06:10:37,950
Hmm?

6272
06:10:44,490 --> 06:10:47,010
My ammo is like... Oof!

6273
06:10:47,730 --> 06:10:48,130
Oof!

6274
06:10:48,650 --> 06:10:50,330
Wait, can I just leave through here?

6275
06:10:52,530 --> 06:10:53,490
Oh, I see!

6276
06:10:53,570 --> 06:10:55,150
Wait, there's... Oh, I'm sitting on a fort!

6277
06:10:55,270 --> 06:10:55,770
Okay, wait.

6278
06:10:58,090 --> 06:10:59,130
Uh... Where's one?

6279
06:10:59,150 --> 06:10:59,570
A one?

6280
06:11:02,270 --> 06:11:04,070
How do I reset it?

6281
06:11:04,250 --> 06:11:05,010
Okay, wait.

6282
06:11:06,950 --> 06:11:07,550
One.

6283
06:11:08,530 --> 06:11:09,050
Whoa!

6284
06:11:11,630 --> 06:11:12,670
Two.

6285
06:11:14,790 --> 06:11:15,910
Um, three.

6286
06:11:20,390 --> 06:11:21,690
I'm walking carefully.

6287
06:11:21,930 --> 06:11:22,210
Three.

6288
06:11:24,070 --> 06:11:25,590
There's also a trash can.

6289
06:11:26,230 --> 06:11:26,530
Four.

6290
06:11:29,190 --> 06:11:30,230
Five.

6291
06:11:31,070 --> 06:11:31,450
Six.

6292
06:11:33,990 --> 06:11:34,150
Oh!

6293
06:11:34,170 --> 06:11:36,930
Oh, that was the quietest door ever.

6294
06:11:41,030 --> 06:11:41,870
Shotgun ammo!

6295
06:11:42,790 --> 06:11:45,230
Thank goodness it's not seven digits.

6296
06:11:46,390 --> 06:11:46,810
Yeah.

6297
06:11:47,750 --> 06:11:48,690
How is that optional?

6298
06:11:49,050 --> 06:11:51,670
Oh, I guess if you do the code...

6299
06:11:52,930 --> 06:11:53,870
I don't know.

6300
06:11:55,410 --> 06:11:56,250
She's still here.

6301
06:11:58,490 --> 06:12:02,130
If you know how to do the code and you do it while...

6302
06:12:02,130 --> 06:12:03,010
Hmm, I don't know.

6303
06:12:07,900 --> 06:12:09,080
But what is this?

6304
06:12:09,620 --> 06:12:10,220
9218.

6305
06:12:10,680 --> 06:12:12,460
And also this whole puzzle here.

6306
06:12:19,140 --> 06:12:19,460
Goblin.

6307
06:12:22,460 --> 06:12:25,960
Emerged at around 55% root excavation.

6308
06:12:26,280 --> 06:12:28,560
Despite their small stature, I've concluded that they are
not in...

6309
06:12:28,560 --> 06:12:30,440
I've been calling it a baby.

6310
06:12:31,220 --> 06:12:34,720
On the contrary, they may be a senior variant of their
guests.

6311
06:12:35,520 --> 06:12:40,440
Their advanced age causing a weaker genetic makeup, which
has diminished their anatomy of what I've been...

6312
06:12:40,840 --> 06:12:42,400
gone in a baby.

6313
06:12:44,500 --> 06:12:45,620
Oh, my bad, sorry.

6314
06:12:47,560 --> 06:12:48,460
This guy is scary.

6315
06:12:49,000 --> 06:12:49,280
Spindle.

6316
06:12:50,720 --> 06:12:53,640
Much of their muscle and fat is missing, but their bones
have become elongated.

6317
06:12:54,060 --> 06:12:58,240
However, the bone mass is spread more thinly, and
consequently the bones are brittle.

6318
06:12:58,600 --> 06:13:01,960
Additionally, without sufficient flesh as cushioning, their
joints are weak.

6319
06:13:05,340 --> 06:13:05,820
Lumber.

6320
06:13:06,140 --> 06:13:06,920
Have I seen this guy?

6321
06:13:08,060 --> 06:13:09,280
Same time as spindles.

6322
06:13:10,840 --> 06:13:11,500
can be observed.

6323
06:13:11,840 --> 06:13:13,920
Lumbers are stiff and stout with excessive muscle and fat.

6324
06:13:14,220 --> 06:13:16,700
Perhaps this could explain why spindles have insufficient
flesh.

6325
06:13:18,940 --> 06:13:20,500
This guy, Grinner.

6326
06:13:21,020 --> 06:13:21,700
I don't like him.

6327
06:13:22,400 --> 06:13:23,840
70% root excavation.

6328
06:13:24,540 --> 06:13:28,460
Form is bipedal, but other similarities to a human body are
quickly disappearing.

6329
06:13:29,420 --> 06:13:32,460
In terms of anatomy, each specimen is vastly different from
the next.

6330
06:13:34,380 --> 06:13:34,900
Puddle.

6331
06:13:38,120 --> 06:13:40,260
They are quite literally melting.

6332
06:13:42,720 --> 06:13:44,600
And this is just guessed.

6333
06:13:45,380 --> 06:13:47,260
They largely retain a human-like appearance.

6334
06:13:47,520 --> 06:13:50,860
Most distressing, they are capable of a limited non-verbal
form of vocalization.

6335
06:13:51,500 --> 06:13:51,620
Yeah!

6336
06:13:53,120 --> 06:13:54,220
We hate puddle.

6337
06:13:54,480 --> 06:13:55,300
Yeah, puddle sucks.

6338
06:13:55,660 --> 06:13:56,360
So what is this?

6339
06:13:56,860 --> 06:13:57,460
Oh, wait.

6340
06:13:59,780 --> 06:14:01,860
Control room elevator switch number code.

6341
06:14:02,560 --> 06:14:04,980
My first is in Grinner, but also in Goblin.

6342
06:14:06,100 --> 06:14:06,800
My second...

6343
06:14:06,800 --> 06:14:07,580
Oh, gosh.

6344
06:14:07,760 --> 06:14:07,980
Okay.

6345
06:14:08,300 --> 06:14:08,660
Oh.

6346
06:14:09,140 --> 06:14:09,700
Yeah.

6347
06:14:11,600 --> 06:14:13,440
Wait, this is going to be so annoying.

6348
06:14:15,000 --> 06:14:16,360
Okay, guys, we got this.

6349
06:14:25,360 --> 06:14:27,960
My first is in Grinner, but also in Goblin.

6350
06:14:29,360 --> 06:14:33,720
I'm wondering if this is the code that's on the bot, you
know, the back of here.

6351
06:14:34,760 --> 06:14:35,540
Wait, no, go back.

6352
06:14:39,450 --> 06:14:40,430
Oh, Grinner.

6353
06:14:47,500 --> 06:14:47,880
Bot.

6354
06:14:48,880 --> 06:14:49,360
5592.

6355
06:14:50,600 --> 06:14:51,680
But also in Goblin.

6356
06:14:58,100 --> 06:14:58,580
173.

6357
06:14:58,600 --> 06:15:04,070
They have nothing in common.

6358
06:15:08,010 --> 06:15:08,650
Oh, the nine!

6359
06:15:13,010 --> 06:15:13,570
Sorry.

6360
06:15:16,690 --> 06:15:17,470
They have nine!

6361
06:15:17,850 --> 06:15:18,290
Wait a second.

6362
06:15:19,790 --> 06:15:21,630
If this starts with a nine...

6363
06:15:22,910 --> 06:15:24,030
9-218.

6364
06:15:24,250 --> 06:15:25,190
You guys, we have it.

6365
06:15:27,210 --> 06:15:27,750
Alright.

6366
06:15:28,470 --> 06:15:29,630
So now...

6367
06:15:30,990 --> 06:15:31,550
Um...

6368
06:15:36,790 --> 06:15:39,170
What did I need to do?

6369
06:15:42,780 --> 06:15:43,140
Um...

6370
06:15:44,840 --> 06:15:47,160
What did I need to do?

6371
06:15:47,820 --> 06:15:50,560
Oh, we have the key?

6372
06:15:51,800 --> 06:15:56,080
Okay, the golden key went to the area in the mermaid place.

6373
06:15:56,760 --> 06:15:59,100
And also Crow's office.

6374
06:15:59,700 --> 06:16:01,280
Did it go anywhere else?

6375
06:16:01,540 --> 06:16:04,880
I don't... I think that room in Crow Country.

6376
06:16:07,920 --> 06:16:08,280
Maybe.

6377
06:16:12,550 --> 06:16:13,870
I can't remember.

6378
06:16:18,060 --> 06:16:19,220
Big man!

6379
06:16:20,000 --> 06:16:21,320
Big man!

6380
06:16:24,660 --> 06:16:27,200
Did you solve the toilet bones?

6381
06:16:27,320 --> 06:16:30,620
No, I think we might have to abandon toilet bones.

6382
06:16:31,500 --> 06:16:32,660
We might not be toilet boning.

6383
06:16:34,880 --> 06:16:36,740
I hope things didn't respawn here.

6384
06:16:39,840 --> 06:16:40,240
Okay.

6385
06:16:41,240 --> 06:16:44,700
We have to go to We are at Sunday.

6386
06:16:45,140 --> 06:16:46,800
We must go to Thursday.

6387
06:16:48,800 --> 06:16:50,420
Seems like things didn't.

6388
06:16:52,300 --> 06:16:53,940
I think we're okay.

6389
06:17:02,500 --> 06:17:04,600
Perhaps things did not regenerate.

6390
06:17:20,560 --> 06:17:22,820
Will this ride be better than old reliable?

6391
06:17:23,040 --> 06:17:23,840
There's no way.

6392
06:17:24,440 --> 06:17:26,540
Old reliable is like number one for me.

6393
06:17:27,980 --> 06:17:28,440
Okay.

6394
06:17:30,660 --> 06:17:31,660
Toilet boning?

6395
06:17:33,300 --> 06:17:35,580
Ah, this house got good bones!

6396
06:17:38,740 --> 06:17:39,400
Are you still here?

6397
06:17:39,540 --> 06:17:39,740
Oh!

6398
06:17:40,180 --> 06:17:40,760
She's still here.

6399
06:17:40,880 --> 06:17:42,820
Okay, I'm gonna go unlock the door first.

6400
06:17:44,120 --> 06:17:48,500
Let's make sure there's nothing out here.

6401
06:17:54,760 --> 06:17:55,640
Alright, I think we're good.

6402
06:18:00,150 --> 06:18:01,030
The golden key.

6403
06:18:02,270 --> 06:18:03,670
I've got the golden ticket.

6404
06:18:05,930 --> 06:18:07,130
It is still ringing.

6405
06:18:09,550 --> 06:18:10,490
There's even pizza!

6406
06:18:11,730 --> 06:18:13,490
Old slices of pizza are still inside.

6407
06:18:13,670 --> 06:18:14,990
I'm not hungry enough to do it.

6408
06:18:16,350 --> 06:18:17,270
I'm not hungry enough.

6409
06:18:17,530 --> 06:18:19,070
You can't make me do it!

6410
06:18:19,930 --> 06:18:20,330
Hello?

6411
06:18:20,970 --> 06:18:22,130
You're still alive.

6412
06:18:22,950 --> 06:18:24,030
I know it's dangerous up there.

6413
06:18:24,170 --> 06:18:25,590
How were you calling here?

6414
06:18:25,710 --> 06:18:28,130
And then also calling me in your room, huh?

6415
06:18:30,290 --> 06:18:30,690
Hmm.

6416
06:18:32,670 --> 06:18:33,950
I know it's dangerous up there.

6417
06:18:34,030 --> 06:18:35,710
A lot of them got out into the open.

6418
06:18:36,170 --> 06:18:37,330
But I know you brought a gun.

6419
06:18:38,110 --> 06:18:38,970
Have you been killing them?

6420
06:18:39,550 --> 06:18:42,570
There are no shape to continue living.

6421
06:18:43,350 --> 06:18:45,630
The ones that emerged more recently, even more so.

6422
06:18:46,190 --> 06:18:50,130
As I continue the root excavation, the guests became even
less.

6423
06:18:50,650 --> 06:18:53,590
Well, some of them aren't even bipedal anymore.

6424
06:18:55,370 --> 06:18:57,830
It goes without saying that we cannot let them leave crow
country.

6425
06:18:58,490 --> 06:19:00,590
We cannot afford to let them infect anybody else.

6426
06:19:01,690 --> 06:19:02,270
What are they?

6427
06:19:02,590 --> 06:19:03,230
Who are they?

6428
06:19:04,070 --> 06:19:05,470
They are irreversible.

6429
06:19:07,170 --> 06:19:07,690
Infect.

6430
06:19:12,180 --> 06:19:13,040
What does that say?

6431
06:19:13,160 --> 06:19:14,200
Ride area?

6432
06:19:16,980 --> 06:19:17,720
It's a hat.

6433
06:19:18,160 --> 06:19:19,940
I wonder if sea captains really wear these hats.

6434
06:19:20,300 --> 06:19:22,220
Or have I been lied to by cartoons?

6435
06:19:23,380 --> 06:19:23,900
What's in here?

6436
06:19:30,890 --> 06:19:32,750
Wait, I don't really want to waste my ammo.

6437
06:19:35,870 --> 06:19:37,050
Game hates me!

6438
06:19:41,600 --> 06:19:42,020
Okay.

6439
06:19:44,400 --> 06:19:46,060
Alright, let's do the ride.

6440
06:19:49,120 --> 06:19:49,780
Anything I can do?

6441
06:19:49,800 --> 06:19:50,240
do for you?

6442
06:19:51,460 --> 06:19:56,160
Uh, the boat ride, the seven seas, use your help operate the
controls, have you opened the door?

6443
06:19:56,560 --> 06:19:57,220
Yeah, it's open.

6444
06:19:57,540 --> 06:19:58,020
Nice work.

6445
06:19:58,320 --> 06:20:01,140
I'll head to the control room and you can get, you go to the
boat boarding area.

6446
06:20:01,480 --> 06:20:02,040
See you there.

6447
06:20:03,140 --> 06:20:03,460
Okay.

6448
06:20:04,000 --> 06:20:06,880
Why do I feel like something's gonna chase me onto the boat,
you know?

6449
06:20:07,920 --> 06:20:08,840
I'm scared.

6450
06:20:15,360 --> 06:20:16,480
The seven seas.

6451
06:20:21,340 --> 06:20:21,740
Okay.

6452
06:20:22,360 --> 06:20:22,980
Number two.

6453
06:20:27,830 --> 06:20:29,130
I get it all to myself.

6454
06:20:29,750 --> 06:20:29,750
Nice.

6455
06:20:32,050 --> 06:20:32,710
Are you ready to go?

6456
06:20:33,090 --> 06:20:33,990
She's wearing the hat.

6457
06:20:34,230 --> 06:20:34,710
So cute.

6458
06:20:34,950 --> 06:20:35,530
I think so.

6459
06:20:36,050 --> 06:20:37,350
I can't guarantee this will be safe.

6460
06:20:37,750 --> 06:20:38,450
Should I start the ride?

6461
06:20:39,490 --> 06:20:39,910
Start.

6462
06:20:40,710 --> 06:20:41,850
Start the ride, Julie.

6463
06:20:45,510 --> 06:20:46,530
Here we go!

6464
06:20:50,150 --> 06:20:52,390
Okay, I can't shoot while on the ride.

6465
06:20:53,190 --> 06:20:54,450
I can't even look at my inventory.

6466
06:20:55,030 --> 06:20:56,430
Oh, there's, like, stuff around here, though.

6467
06:20:58,690 --> 06:20:59,130
Oh.

6468
06:20:59,850 --> 06:21:01,630
The white whale is blocking the boat.

6469
06:21:02,630 --> 06:21:05,170
If I remember it right, he's supposed to move out of the
way.

6470
06:21:05,930 --> 06:21:07,910
But I think it's done manually from the control panel.

6471
06:21:08,570 --> 06:21:10,090
I wonder why Julie didn't press the button!

6472
06:21:11,390 --> 06:21:12,110
Oh, that's fine.

6473
06:21:12,790 --> 06:21:13,890
Does this have something in there?

6474
06:21:15,390 --> 06:21:16,270
Control box.

6475
06:21:16,490 --> 06:21:17,270
Okay, one second.

6476
06:21:18,210 --> 06:21:18,930
Before then.

6477
06:21:21,730 --> 06:21:23,290
Can't see a way to open it.

6478
06:21:25,030 --> 06:21:26,850
The other one looked fake, though.

6479
06:21:28,470 --> 06:21:31,330
There was something over here, but it looks fake, you know?

6480
06:21:33,210 --> 06:21:34,470
Nah, it looks fake.

6481
06:21:37,170 --> 06:21:38,050
Dang it.

6482
06:21:39,510 --> 06:21:40,270
Press a button.

6483
06:21:40,630 --> 06:21:40,950
That's okay.

6484
06:21:41,250 --> 06:21:41,950
Press a button.

6485
06:21:44,870 --> 06:21:46,710
Oh my god, that scared me.

6486
06:21:49,490 --> 06:21:50,530
Oh, there's mermaids.

6487
06:21:52,030 --> 06:21:53,310
Oh my god, there's mermaids.

6488
06:21:58,660 --> 06:21:59,640
What is this?

6489
06:21:59,660 --> 06:22:00,940
to over here.

6490
06:22:01,560 --> 06:22:03,660
Oh wait, but there is this box I can break.

6491
06:22:07,570 --> 06:22:07,950
Medkit!

6492
06:22:12,530 --> 06:22:14,430
In a time where I need more ammo.

6493
06:22:15,750 --> 06:22:17,750
I guess I should go back to my car, maybe.

6494
06:22:21,610 --> 06:22:23,010
Oh, it's breaking up closer.

6495
06:22:30,430 --> 06:22:30,810
Ooh!

6496
06:22:37,400 --> 06:22:42,240
If she's close and then I lift her up, can I take her
battery?

6497
06:22:47,990 --> 06:22:48,710
Let's see.

6498
06:22:50,290 --> 06:22:51,530
Open her up!

6499
06:22:53,030 --> 06:22:54,270
There's nothing in there.

6500
06:22:54,650 --> 06:22:55,370
Oh, okay, okay.

6501
06:22:56,270 --> 06:22:58,290
Alright, we gotta try the other...

6502
06:23:02,160 --> 06:23:04,500
I think the second one gets close enough.

6503
06:23:05,360 --> 06:23:05,600
Maybe.

6504
06:23:07,100 --> 06:23:08,640
Or maybe they all get close enough.

6505
06:23:08,820 --> 06:23:09,180
Let's try it.

6506
06:23:14,760 --> 06:23:15,820
Oh, yeah, they all do.

6507
06:23:15,940 --> 06:23:16,320
Just kidding.

6508
06:23:17,120 --> 06:23:17,460
Okay.

6509
06:23:20,570 --> 06:23:21,050
Okay.

6510
06:23:21,070 --> 06:23:23,230
There's a battery in here, but it's totally fried.

6511
06:23:23,670 --> 06:23:24,970
I can't use it, but I'll leave it alone.

6512
06:23:36,130 --> 06:23:37,790
Alright, third time's the charm, everybody.

6513
06:23:37,970 --> 06:23:38,650
This is the one.

6514
06:23:38,730 --> 06:23:39,550
This is the one.

6515
06:23:39,770 --> 06:23:40,570
Unless it's purple.

6516
06:23:41,050 --> 06:23:43,370
It would make sense as if it's purple because of her hair.

6517
06:23:46,490 --> 06:23:47,110
Is that a battery?

6518
06:23:47,710 --> 06:23:48,210
Wait, no.

6519
06:23:48,530 --> 06:23:49,810
It's a case of shotgun shells.

6520
06:23:50,170 --> 06:23:50,950
We take those.

6521
06:23:52,310 --> 06:23:52,890
You know what?

6522
06:23:54,110 --> 06:23:54,470
Awesome.

6523
06:23:55,130 --> 06:23:56,290
We take those, for real.

6524
06:24:05,070 --> 06:24:05,590
Lift!

6525
06:24:11,310 --> 06:24:13,290
It's a battery in fairly good condition.

6526
06:24:17,690 --> 06:24:19,290
What do I do here though now?

6527
06:24:20,710 --> 06:24:22,170
Can I tell her that I need to leave?

6528
06:24:25,470 --> 06:24:26,150
Why did it stop?

6529
06:24:28,670 --> 06:24:29,250
Oh, okay.

6530
06:24:31,690 --> 06:24:32,210
Um...

6531
06:24:40,590 --> 06:24:41,250
White whale.

6532
06:24:41,830 --> 06:24:43,250
To the last I grapple with thee.

6533
06:24:43,890 --> 06:24:45,710
From hell's heart I stab at thee.

6534
06:24:46,570 --> 06:24:49,270
For hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.

6535
06:24:50,090 --> 06:24:50,830
He's black in the boat.

6536
06:24:50,970 --> 06:24:51,950
I can't continue the ride.

6537
06:24:57,960 --> 06:25:00,220
Biggest, most ornate switch I've ever seen.

6538
06:25:03,740 --> 06:25:04,880
What did it do?

6539
06:25:06,860 --> 06:25:07,420
Hey!

6540
06:25:09,420 --> 06:25:10,120
Uh-oh.

6541
06:25:11,460 --> 06:25:12,280
That's blood.

6542
06:25:16,190 --> 06:25:17,510
Something in the vent!

6543
06:25:18,570 --> 06:25:20,110
What, we're just gonna ignore that?

6544
06:25:20,930 --> 06:25:21,170
Wait.

6545
06:25:21,870 --> 06:25:22,750
It's the control panel.

6546
06:25:23,070 --> 06:25:23,770
There's blood on it.

6547
06:25:24,010 --> 06:25:25,210
That seems to have stopped working.

6548
06:25:27,990 --> 06:25:29,370
Did they eat the pizza?

6549
06:25:30,350 --> 06:25:31,750
The pizza is still safe.

6550
06:25:34,730 --> 06:25:35,210
Uh-oh.

6551
06:25:38,410 --> 06:25:38,890
Julie?

6552
06:25:41,210 --> 06:25:41,690
Okay.

6553
06:25:42,410 --> 06:25:44,750
Alright, we got the battery, so we have to go put it in.

6554
06:25:44,770 --> 06:25:45,590
in the crow.

6555
06:25:47,930 --> 06:25:48,250
Oh, whoops.

6556
06:25:48,510 --> 06:25:49,190
My bad.

6557
06:25:54,030 --> 06:25:55,410
It's nighttime now.

6558
06:25:56,090 --> 06:25:56,870
Aw, man.

6559
06:26:00,960 --> 06:26:02,920
Yeah, the glass jar, I'm saving my ammo.

6560
06:26:03,340 --> 06:26:04,680
I don't want to quite get it.

6561
06:26:12,120 --> 06:26:12,960
Oh, that's not Julie.

6562
06:26:13,580 --> 06:26:14,020
Is it?

6563
06:26:15,360 --> 06:26:16,100
That's not Julie.

6564
06:26:17,660 --> 06:26:18,960
What is it?

6565
06:26:21,400 --> 06:26:21,960
Julie?

6566
06:26:22,740 --> 06:26:23,260
You good?

6567
06:26:23,980 --> 06:26:24,520
Julie?

6568
06:26:26,420 --> 06:26:29,160
At least this is still working.

6569
06:26:37,270 --> 06:26:37,770
Julie!

6570
06:26:38,670 --> 06:26:39,690
Julie's not in here?

6571
06:26:40,290 --> 06:26:40,610
No.

6572
06:26:50,700 --> 06:26:51,700
Neptune's Palace.

6573
06:26:58,060 --> 06:26:58,560
Stop.

6574
06:26:59,800 --> 06:27:02,500
I think this is the room that...

6575
06:27:02,500 --> 06:27:03,480
The storage room.

6576
06:27:03,700 --> 06:27:04,500
Let's see if I can shoot it.

6577
06:27:05,440 --> 06:27:05,620
No.

6578
06:27:06,020 --> 06:27:06,880
Whoa, what the hell?

6579
06:27:07,180 --> 06:27:08,180
Where did that come from?

6580
06:27:10,440 --> 06:27:10,940
Ah!

6581
06:27:13,180 --> 06:27:14,060
Oh my god!

6582
06:27:17,260 --> 06:27:18,740
Someone's out here killing all these things.

6583
06:27:21,380 --> 06:27:21,980
Can I put you...

6584
06:27:21,980 --> 06:27:22,920
Can I put the battery?

6585
06:27:23,220 --> 06:27:26,440
I turn on the elevator behind you.

6586
06:27:26,760 --> 06:27:28,020
Can you move out of the way, please?

6587
06:27:28,320 --> 06:27:28,620
Yeah.

6588
06:27:29,460 --> 06:27:30,380
Oh my god!

6589
06:27:30,500 --> 06:27:31,560
Who's shooting at me?

6590
06:27:36,000 --> 06:27:36,800
Oh, that's right.

6591
06:27:36,900 --> 06:27:38,680
I have to turn him around, I think.

6592
06:27:40,540 --> 06:27:41,140
Oh no, that's right.

6593
06:27:41,380 --> 06:27:42,080
Out of power.

6594
06:27:51,200 --> 06:27:54,580
boss get down that's an enemy gun ship

6595
06:27:57,820 --> 06:28:06,820

of me is also like well i could just do this oh the battery

6598
06:28:19,520 --> 06:28:23,260
suddenly is charging oh shoot I don't know how to charge it.

6599
06:28:28,490 --> 06:28:29,510
Can we take it?

6600
06:28:42,670 --> 06:28:45,650
It was 24 Fahrenheit with wind chill.

6601
06:28:45,870 --> 06:28:47,890
But the Oshikatsu is worth it!

6602
06:28:48,070 --> 06:28:49,310
Oh my gosh!

6603
06:28:49,810 --> 06:28:51,050
Why is it so cold?

6604
06:28:54,400 --> 06:28:56,340
Yeah, time to go investigate, I guess.

6605
06:28:56,600 --> 06:28:58,700
All these guys are down, too, so...

6606
06:28:58,700 --> 06:29:00,580
Wait, which way is it?

6607
06:29:00,900 --> 06:29:02,120
Also, can I go in here yet?

6608
06:29:03,720 --> 06:29:04,960
Locked on the other side.

6609
06:29:07,400 --> 06:29:07,940
Silver key.

6610
06:29:07,960 --> 06:29:11,100
Oh my gosh, I could have gone in here a million years ago!

6611
06:29:17,970 --> 06:29:24,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

6612
06:29:24,610 --> 06:29:29,350
Oh, shoot.

6613
06:29:30,870 --> 06:29:32,350
Why am I doing this?

6614
06:29:34,150 --> 06:29:34,670
Um.

6615
06:29:35,270 --> 06:29:36,470
I only have, like, 20.

6616
06:29:37,510 --> 06:29:38,410
20 left.

6617
06:29:38,850 --> 06:29:40,690
Maybe I should ignore them.

6618
06:29:41,110 --> 06:29:41,610
Ignore them?

6619
06:29:41,810 --> 06:29:42,010
Ouch.

6620
06:29:42,530 --> 06:29:42,950
Ouch, bitch, oh.

6621
06:29:44,950 --> 06:29:52,750

mushroom magic to grant you a wish tell me what is it that

6622

6623
06:30:08,770 --> 06:30:17,550
oh wait he's coming this way isn't he I think I'm in trouble
oh I'm looking around very carefully to see if there's

6624
06:30:17,550 --> 06:30:18,470
anything for me to grab.

6625
06:30:19,330 --> 06:30:20,130
I don't see anything.

6626
06:30:20,730 --> 06:30:22,030
Well, I'm just gonna leave!

6627
06:30:25,890 --> 06:30:27,410
Well, we got to check out that area.

6628
06:30:27,590 --> 06:30:28,530
That's kind of fun.

6629
06:30:30,830 --> 06:30:32,070
Oh my god, this scared me.

6630
06:30:34,470 --> 06:30:34,830
Hey!

6631
06:30:37,510 --> 06:30:39,770
I can't tell if these will hit me or not, you know?

6632
06:30:39,910 --> 06:30:40,650
Wait, what was that?

6633
06:30:41,530 --> 06:30:42,630
Something just flashed yellow.

6634
06:30:44,550 --> 06:30:46,070
Oh, it was a...

6635
06:30:46,070 --> 06:30:46,430
Never mind.

6636
06:30:49,050 --> 06:30:49,710
Soda can.

6637
06:30:50,750 --> 06:30:52,710
I wish I had filled my ass in.

6638
06:30:53,970 --> 06:30:54,470
I would have...

6639
06:30:54,470 --> 06:30:55,310
I would have boned.

6640
06:30:56,170 --> 06:30:57,210
I would have gotten the bones.

6641
06:31:01,890 --> 06:31:02,470
What's that?

6642
06:31:03,090 --> 06:31:04,570
Diagram of video game controller.

6643
06:31:05,250 --> 06:31:06,510
Oh, was that always there?

6644
06:31:07,790 --> 06:31:10,430
Literally finding part of the tutorial right now.

6645
06:31:11,030 --> 06:31:12,190
What was shooting at me?

6646
06:31:13,290 --> 06:31:13,970
Are you okay?

6647
06:31:15,710 --> 06:31:16,090
Did the...

6648
06:31:16,090 --> 06:31:16,910
Did a police call...

6649
06:31:17,050 --> 06:31:17,850
Can the officer come by here?

6650
06:31:18,330 --> 06:31:19,290
Yeah, he was on a bike.

6651
06:31:19,950 --> 06:31:20,810
Did he talk to him?

6652
06:31:23,510 --> 06:31:25,150
Wait, I can still use the acid.

6653
06:31:25,310 --> 06:31:26,330
I have enough in my inventory?

6654
06:31:31,900 --> 06:31:33,260
Wait, what do you mean I have enough?

6655
06:31:34,520 --> 06:31:36,140
What do you mean I have enough?

6656
06:31:36,300 --> 06:31:37,680
Is it only if I have zero?

6657
06:31:37,920 --> 06:31:38,540
That's so lame.

6658
06:31:40,000 --> 06:31:44,460
But I also know that there was, there's a secret here.

6659
06:31:46,040 --> 06:31:47,580
I just don't know how to find it.

6660
06:31:48,800 --> 06:31:49,740
It's so dark.

6661
06:31:53,000 --> 06:31:54,180
It's a car.

6662
06:31:55,520 --> 06:31:56,560
Mm-hmm.

6663
06:31:59,180 --> 06:32:00,460
Reload my handgun first.

6664
06:32:03,640 --> 06:32:04,700
There we go.

6665
06:32:06,540 --> 06:32:07,100
No!

6666
06:32:09,930 --> 06:32:11,590
It still hates me.

6667
06:32:12,870 --> 06:32:14,090
There's a secret here.

6668
06:32:14,130 --> 06:32:15,370
I saw it on the map.

6669
06:32:15,910 --> 06:32:16,190
See?

6670
06:32:19,960 --> 06:32:21,080
Eat El Crow.

6671
06:32:21,360 --> 06:32:22,020
Oh, silver!

6672
06:32:23,880 --> 06:32:25,100
Is it a mushroom man?

6673
06:32:25,120 --> 06:32:33,220
mushroom boy mushroom boy it's a shoe box to Natalie happy
17th dad running

6674
06:32:38,040 --> 06:32:42,200
shoes okay oh my god

6675
06:32:49,230 --> 06:33:01,270
who's shooting at me then we're zooming that's so funny it
looks so goofy I still have to be careful where I walk

6676
06:33:01,270 --> 06:33:05,110
though because of traps all right well I'm just gonna save
one more time.

6677
06:33:07,390 --> 06:33:08,470
Oh, the acid.

6678
06:33:08,750 --> 06:33:09,870
Let's see if the acid works.

6679
06:33:10,230 --> 06:33:11,790
Sorry, I forgot to check that too.

6680
06:33:17,710 --> 06:33:18,910
Hopefully there's nobody in here.

6681
06:33:28,180 --> 06:33:29,140
Oh, uh, oh, oh.

6682
06:33:29,720 --> 06:33:30,700
I think I...

6683
06:33:30,700 --> 06:33:31,400
There we go.

6684
06:33:31,900 --> 06:33:33,420
Oh, it did work!

6685
06:33:34,100 --> 06:33:35,600
I think the bones are melting.

6686
06:33:39,660 --> 06:33:41,600
It's a box of magnum ammo.

6687
06:33:44,340 --> 06:33:44,780
Oh.

6688
06:33:45,700 --> 06:33:48,000
I don't even have the revolver!

6689
06:33:50,160 --> 06:33:51,120
So lame!

6690
06:33:59,730 --> 06:34:00,690
Dang it.

6691
06:34:05,080 --> 06:34:06,560
It's very close.

6692
06:34:08,600 --> 06:34:10,220
There was still stuff in the shop.

6693
06:34:10,400 --> 06:34:11,040
Oh, there was?

6694
06:34:12,440 --> 06:34:13,660
Honestly, I was so scared.

6695
06:34:13,860 --> 06:34:15,020
I just wanted to get out.

6696
06:34:17,200 --> 06:34:17,440
Wait.

6697
06:34:18,520 --> 06:34:20,200
Oh, I forgot to open it from the other side.

6698
06:34:22,180 --> 06:34:23,920
Everyone's in gift shop for the revolver.

6699
06:34:24,540 --> 06:34:27,440
Do I even... I mean, I have six shots.

6700
06:34:30,020 --> 06:34:31,140
Six shots.

6701
06:34:32,100 --> 06:34:33,280
Maybe I don't need anymore.

6702
06:34:36,600 --> 06:34:38,700
The Crypt Ophelia riddle.

6703
06:34:38,900 --> 06:34:39,460
Oh, true.

6704
06:34:39,740 --> 06:34:40,320
Yeah, yeah.

6705
06:34:42,040 --> 06:34:42,560
It's okay.

6706
06:34:42,640 --> 06:34:45,920
I'm not here to get every single thing.

6707
06:34:46,820 --> 06:34:50,540
I'm gonna go ask my crow friend for help on how to...

6708
06:34:54,540 --> 06:35:15,040
this battery there's a battery charger on the underground
level okay stop shooting at me please you're scaring me so

6709
06:35:15,040 --> 06:35:25,400
so straightforward I'd rather not thank you so much for the
for the thank you to thank you

6710
06:35:31,810 --> 06:35:33,790
So are things dead in here too?

6711
06:35:39,630 --> 06:35:42,490
Because if so, this whole area is basically like free roam
now.

6712
06:35:45,010 --> 06:35:45,890
Oh my god.

6713
06:35:56,680 --> 06:35:57,640
Good night.

6714
06:35:58,240 --> 06:35:58,860
I'll take it.

6715
06:36:02,950 --> 06:36:03,410
Okay.

6716
06:36:05,390 --> 06:36:06,710
I think we're all right.

6717
06:36:06,930 --> 06:36:10,730
I think I'm just gonna focus on getting...

6718
06:36:10,730 --> 06:36:13,130
Okay, this goes down to where...

6719
06:36:13,130 --> 06:36:13,190
Okay.

6720
06:36:13,210 --> 06:36:14,830
We are here.

6721
06:36:15,490 --> 06:36:17,830
This is gonna take us to Slenderman.

6722
06:36:22,740 --> 06:36:24,280
Oh, I could talk to the mushroom.

6723
06:36:24,500 --> 06:36:24,820
You're right.

6724
06:36:25,240 --> 06:36:25,820
Wait, what's going on?

6725
06:36:25,840 --> 06:36:26,360
What is this?

6726
06:36:27,700 --> 06:36:28,900
Are these lasers now?

6727
06:36:29,640 --> 06:36:30,540
Why do we have lasers?

6728
06:36:31,040 --> 06:36:31,840
Wait a second.

6729
06:36:34,360 --> 06:36:35,640
Why do we have lasers?

6730
06:36:36,460 --> 06:36:37,460
Wait, wait, wait.

6731
06:36:39,620 --> 06:36:41,000
Is that the battery charger?

6732
06:36:47,420 --> 06:36:49,200
I'm so ridiculous while running.

6733
06:36:52,980 --> 06:36:54,180
Oh my god, game!

6734
06:36:55,040 --> 06:36:56,120
Please be kind.

6735
06:36:58,140 --> 06:36:59,160
Let's go to...

6736
06:36:59,160 --> 06:37:01,660
Oh my gosh, I just nearly dodged that too.

6737
06:37:02,500 --> 06:37:03,280
I think there...

6738
06:37:03,280 --> 06:37:04,860
No, there's still things inside.

6739
06:37:05,200 --> 06:37:05,640
Yeah, it's okay.

6740
06:37:05,800 --> 06:37:08,220
It's just outside that is safe at the moment.

6741
06:37:11,440 --> 06:37:13,480
Is this not a battery charger?

6742
06:37:14,660 --> 06:37:14,940
Okay.

6743
06:37:14,960 --> 06:37:16,000
I guess not.

6744
06:37:16,440 --> 06:37:17,380
Oh, ouch!

6745
06:37:17,680 --> 06:37:17,800
Ouch!

6746
06:37:18,060 --> 06:37:18,620
Oh my gosh.

6747
06:37:20,700 --> 06:37:23,040
I was trying to see what was inside that jar.

6748
06:37:24,780 --> 06:37:25,660
I might caution.

6749
06:37:27,140 --> 06:37:27,980
Okay, we're fine.

6750
06:37:32,070 --> 06:37:32,470
Flame Thriller.

6751
06:37:34,790 --> 06:37:36,150
I know the crow told me where to go.

6752
06:37:36,610 --> 06:37:37,130
I'm...

6753
06:37:37,130 --> 06:37:39,310
I'm gathering stuff here now.

6754
06:37:40,270 --> 06:37:41,250
More gasoline.

6755
06:37:41,630 --> 06:37:41,830
Okay.

6756
06:37:44,050 --> 06:37:46,130
I'm hunting for items while it's safe.

6757
06:37:47,430 --> 06:37:49,670
Oh, but yeah, let's go back downstairs.

6758
06:37:56,720 --> 06:37:58,300
This is so stupid.

6759
06:37:59,540 --> 06:38:00,020
Where is it?

6760
06:38:00,180 --> 06:38:00,540
Where it is?

6761
06:38:00,680 --> 06:38:01,080
Oh, there it is.

6762
06:38:02,160 --> 06:38:04,100
Wait, I'm gonna save before we go downstairs.

6763
06:38:07,740 --> 06:38:08,260
Awesome.

6764
06:38:14,610 --> 06:38:17,510
Use the electrocution room to charge the battery.

6765
06:38:19,350 --> 06:38:20,390
I wonder...

6766
06:38:23,910 --> 06:38:25,350
Does he get electrocuted?

6767
06:38:26,510 --> 06:38:28,570
That'd be sick if real.

6768
06:38:30,550 --> 06:38:31,930
Your fragile bones, Mr.

6769
06:38:36,760 --> 06:38:37,980
Oh, here he comes.

6770
06:38:39,560 --> 06:38:40,040
Oh, shoot.

6771
06:38:40,260 --> 06:38:40,780
He's invincible?

6772
06:38:41,220 --> 06:38:41,740
Oh, no, he's not.

6773
06:38:54,490 --> 06:38:55,450
Alrighty, um...

6774
06:38:55,890 --> 06:39:00,010
It almost looks like it could pass under my head, but...

6775
06:39:00,770 --> 06:39:01,610
He does...

6776
06:39:01,610 --> 06:39:02,730
He looks so scary.

6777
06:39:02,950 --> 06:39:04,010
He acts so scary.

6778
06:39:04,950 --> 06:39:07,790
Battery charger, battery charger, battery charger.

6779
06:39:08,030 --> 06:39:11,010
Did you guys see anything like a battery charger in here?

6780
06:39:11,430 --> 06:39:11,630
Oh!

6781
06:39:12,090 --> 06:39:13,790
The Root Tuesday!

6782
06:39:14,090 --> 06:39:15,790
It said that I should put something in there.

6783
06:39:15,930 --> 06:39:16,430
I remember.

6784
06:39:26,870 --> 06:39:27,810
Yes, in here!

6785
06:39:29,350 --> 06:39:30,550
Electrocution machine.

6786
06:39:32,930 --> 06:39:33,910
Stick that in.

6787
06:39:34,450 --> 06:39:35,170
Press the button.

6788
06:39:37,510 --> 06:39:38,470
Oh, hold it.

6789
06:39:42,380 --> 06:39:42,980
Yeah!

6790
06:39:43,720 --> 06:39:44,420
Yeah, yeah!

6791
06:39:44,440 --> 06:39:49,440
I think with that, every area will have been...

6792
06:39:51,900 --> 06:39:58,140
Like every map area will have had the circle gone.

6793
06:39:58,900 --> 06:39:59,080
Neat!

6794
06:40:00,700 --> 06:40:03,040
There's just two rooms that I didn't get into.

6795
06:40:03,120 --> 06:40:04,500
Well, I got into the gift shop in the end.

6796
06:40:05,800 --> 06:40:07,700
But that other room I didn't get into.

6797
06:40:07,860 --> 06:40:08,400
But that's okay!

6798
06:40:10,100 --> 06:40:10,580
Alright!

6799
06:40:11,060 --> 06:40:12,220
Let's go.

6800
06:40:18,080 --> 06:40:19,340
It's starting to get sleepy.

6801
06:40:23,760 --> 06:40:24,960
Almost there!

6802
06:40:25,260 --> 06:40:27,140
Yeah, we're almost there!

6803
06:40:34,320 --> 06:40:34,920
Save.

6804
06:40:35,760 --> 06:40:37,140
So I don't have to do it again.

6805
06:40:38,940 --> 06:40:40,140
Save scumming.

6806
06:40:40,300 --> 06:40:41,320
Wait, is this exit?

6807
06:40:43,220 --> 06:40:43,820
Nope.

6808
06:40:45,540 --> 06:40:47,140
That's the gold room.

6809
06:40:48,300 --> 06:40:50,340
That leads... it's over here.

6810
06:40:51,160 --> 06:40:51,920
This way, yeah.

6811
06:40:59,520 --> 06:41:01,500
I'm zooming, I'm zooming.

6812
06:41:03,360 --> 06:41:05,120
Alright, put the battery in.

6813
06:41:06,020 --> 06:41:06,380
What's happening?

6814
06:41:07,920 --> 06:41:09,880
Oh, oh my god!

6815
06:41:10,420 --> 06:41:10,420
Ah!

6816
06:41:10,800 --> 06:41:13,800
God, she like stopped and stared at something so I
thought...

6817
06:41:13,800 --> 06:41:16,000
Oh my god, I like got...

6818
06:41:16,000 --> 06:41:18,420
That was crazy.

6819
06:41:18,620 --> 06:41:21,500
I like got stuck on the thing and then when I moved it
looked like...

6820
06:41:21,500 --> 06:41:22,740
It looked like I got caught in a...

6821
06:41:22,740 --> 06:41:24,180
Caught in a cutscene.

6822
06:41:25,060 --> 06:41:25,680
Oh, nope, nope.

6823
06:41:26,100 --> 06:41:26,600
Alright, we're good.

6824
06:41:26,960 --> 06:41:27,800
Whoa, don't shoot me!

6825
06:41:29,100 --> 06:41:30,740
Turn you around.

6826
06:41:36,720 --> 06:41:37,960
Make you walk.

6827
06:41:43,330 --> 06:41:43,950
Caught seen.

6828
06:41:44,090 --> 06:41:45,090
Yeah, I got caught seen.

6829
06:41:46,670 --> 06:41:48,890
Just like that, he walked out of my life.

6830
06:42:00,900 --> 06:42:04,500
It's fun that he was like the final like kind of piece that
I needed.

6831
06:42:23,850 --> 06:42:25,150
Sorry, hold on.

6832
06:42:27,610 --> 06:42:28,550
Let's do that again.

6833
06:42:34,090 --> 06:42:34,650
Um...

6834
06:42:34,650 --> 06:42:36,090
Stop it!

6835
06:42:44,570 --> 06:42:47,010
Yeah, we must prepare emotionally.

6836
06:42:48,250 --> 06:42:49,570
Try to look for the person shooting you.

6837
06:42:49,650 --> 06:42:50,290
I went over there.

6838
06:42:50,390 --> 06:42:51,310
There's nobody over there.

6839
06:43:05,430 --> 06:43:06,050
Oh my god.

6840
06:43:06,810 --> 06:43:06,990
I

6841
06:43:10,180 --> 06:43:13,520
think now we can use this.

6842
06:43:14,580 --> 06:43:16,500
I'm the little guys left.

6843
06:43:16,980 --> 06:43:17,940
Like you.

6844
06:43:18,240 --> 06:43:18,820
Oops.

6845
06:43:19,540 --> 06:43:20,620
My aim, don't go.

6846
06:43:21,760 --> 06:43:22,300
Daya!

6847
06:43:22,700 --> 06:43:24,780
Thank you so much for the retarab!

6848
06:43:29,290 --> 06:43:29,890
Um.

6849
06:43:30,830 --> 06:43:34,790
I'm at the end of the game, so maybe spoilers.

6850
06:43:37,050 --> 06:43:37,170
Oh.

6851
06:43:48,290 --> 06:43:49,130
What's that?

6852
06:43:49,370 --> 06:43:49,830
Medkit.

6853
06:43:50,610 --> 06:43:51,110
Take that.

6854
06:43:51,750 --> 06:43:53,730
Alright cool, thank you so much for the five gifted!

6855
06:43:53,970 --> 06:43:55,470
Thank you, STM2, thank you for the gifted!

6856
06:43:55,910 --> 06:43:56,890
Thank you, thank you for the gifted!

6857
06:43:57,310 --> 06:43:58,450
Thank you guys, thank you!

6858
06:43:59,130 --> 06:44:00,990
Thank you for the level, thank you for the five gifted!

6859
06:44:01,290 --> 06:44:02,510
Wait, did I miss one?

6860
06:44:03,210 --> 06:44:04,690
I'd rather not, did I get you earlier?

6861
06:44:04,990 --> 06:44:05,510
I think so.

6862
06:44:05,750 --> 06:44:06,290
Thank you though.

6863
06:44:06,530 --> 06:44:07,110
Thank you so much!

6864
06:44:07,190 --> 06:44:08,650
Furby, thank you for the five gifted!

6865
06:44:09,930 --> 06:44:11,230
Thank you guys!

6866
06:44:11,630 --> 06:44:12,350
Thank you!

6867
06:44:13,830 --> 06:44:15,090
Grubby old sports bag.

6868
06:44:15,470 --> 06:44:17,010
Rustin Glitchface, thank you for the five gifted!

6869
06:44:17,690 --> 06:44:18,350
Thank you!

6870
06:44:21,850 --> 06:44:22,510
There's nothing.

6871
06:44:22,670 --> 06:44:23,450
There's something in there.

6872
06:44:24,510 --> 06:44:27,920
Handgun there.

6873
06:44:28,480 --> 06:44:29,520
Um, where does this go to?

6874
06:44:29,620 --> 06:44:30,960
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

6875
06:44:32,000 --> 06:44:33,640
Okay, so these are like quick exits.

6876
06:44:37,400 --> 06:44:39,780
Preparing us for the final battle, it seems.

6877
06:44:45,680 --> 06:44:46,480
It's Harrison!

6878
06:44:47,160 --> 06:44:49,020
Rise now, thank you for the five gifted.

6879
06:44:49,800 --> 06:44:51,420
Jade, thank you for the five gifted.

6880
06:44:51,800 --> 06:44:53,280
Rise now, thank you for the five gifted.

6881
06:44:54,060 --> 06:44:56,060
Thank you for the five, get the...

6882
06:44:56,880 --> 06:44:58,700
No, thank you so much for the tiny cat.

6883
06:44:59,360 --> 06:45:00,140
Thank you.

6884
06:45:01,740 --> 06:45:03,600
Harrison, he's dead!

6885
06:45:04,800 --> 06:45:06,360
He must have been attacked by those.

6886
06:45:07,120 --> 06:45:08,540
Wait, no, he was shot.

6887
06:45:12,700 --> 06:45:14,520
Harrison, I'm so sorry.

6888
06:45:16,320 --> 06:45:20,500
Harrison James, ID number 05061.

6889
06:45:21,380 --> 06:45:22,700
Date of birth, January 12th.

6890
06:45:23,200 --> 06:45:24,560
It was almost his birthday.

6891
06:45:25,620 --> 06:45:28,480
January 12th, 1965.

6892
06:45:29,960 --> 06:45:31,480
Firearms expert.

6893
06:45:38,730 --> 06:45:41,450
He was put on the Edward Crow missing persons case.

6894
06:45:41,930 --> 06:45:43,590
I tried to stop him coming to Crow country.

6895
06:45:44,990 --> 06:45:46,070
He really wanted to help.

6896
06:45:47,530 --> 06:45:52,870
Whoever called Harrison saying like a death flag earlier,
you definitely called it.

6897
06:45:53,650 --> 06:45:55,030
You definitely called it.

6898
06:45:59,270 --> 06:46:00,070
Whoa.

6899
06:46:02,190 --> 06:46:05,310
The mining lanterns are really old and need replacing.

6900
06:46:08,270 --> 06:46:11,870
Any kind of spark tends to set off the oil that's trapped
inside.

6901
06:46:12,910 --> 06:46:14,090
Check my ID.

6902
06:46:21,620 --> 06:46:22,520
Wait, what?

6903
06:46:32,690 --> 06:46:33,130
What?

6904
06:46:33,250 --> 06:46:33,890
It was his ID?

6905
06:46:38,640 --> 06:46:39,720
It's a staff memo.

6906
06:46:40,160 --> 06:46:42,620
Any kind of spark tends to set off the oil that's trapped
inside.

6907
06:46:42,760 --> 06:46:44,220
If that happens, just give it a whack to disperse.

6908
06:46:44,240 --> 06:46:57,420
the oil the flame should go out all right one last puzzle
guys but my brain is really oh gosh sorry i'm getting so

6909
06:46:57,420 --> 06:47:00,320
sleepy do i have to you think i have to shoot this

6910
06:47:05,920 --> 06:47:09,280
we stole his id when we broke into his car

6911
06:47:17,420 --> 06:47:20,900
is that a spark it needs a spark wait but

6912
06:47:35,780 --> 06:47:47,620
Oh, just use the flamethrower.

6913
06:47:47,840 --> 06:47:48,540
You were so right.

6914
06:47:50,000 --> 06:47:50,900
Oh my gosh, you're so right.

6915
06:47:51,040 --> 06:47:53,300
I'm just going to waste all my ammo otherwise.

6916
06:47:58,600 --> 06:47:59,540
Take that for sure.

6917
06:48:04,260 --> 06:48:04,900
Oh, wow.

6918
06:48:07,040 --> 06:48:08,440
I want this one too.

6919
06:48:13,640 --> 06:48:14,940
I'm being greedy right now.

6920
06:48:16,060 --> 06:48:17,400
I'm being absolutely greedy.

6921
06:48:18,380 --> 06:48:19,220
Give me my ammo.

6922
06:48:21,460 --> 06:48:23,620
Is it literally the one thing that I didn't like?

6923
06:48:27,020 --> 06:48:30,660
Is it the second one that I didn't get?

6924
06:48:37,480 --> 06:48:37,800
Oops.

6925
06:48:38,340 --> 06:48:38,540
Wait.

6926
06:48:39,140 --> 06:48:40,260
No, you were in my way.

6927
06:48:41,080 --> 06:48:41,440
Wait, no.

6928
06:48:54,330 --> 06:48:55,950
Oh wait, I had it, didn't I?

6929
06:48:56,050 --> 06:48:57,390
But wait, I wanted to not...

6930
06:48:57,490 --> 06:48:58,830
Oh, shoot.

6931
06:49:04,010 --> 06:49:04,810
I see.

6932
06:49:05,410 --> 06:49:08,670
Wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

6933
06:49:09,090 --> 06:49:10,150
It needs to be seven.

6934
06:49:10,550 --> 06:49:12,410
That needs to be two to go down.

6935
06:49:13,450 --> 06:49:14,250
Oh, no!

6936
06:49:14,930 --> 06:49:16,790
I would have to redo the whole thing.

6937
06:49:24,860 --> 06:49:25,980
I guess we make a do.

6938
06:49:26,340 --> 06:49:27,520
It's just pistol ammo.

6939
06:49:27,660 --> 06:49:28,160
I don't.

6940
06:49:28,820 --> 06:49:29,880
Wait, how do I get rid of it, though?

6941
06:49:32,060 --> 06:49:32,860
Okay, there we go.

6942
06:49:36,240 --> 06:49:36,580
Ah!

6943
06:49:38,980 --> 06:49:51,400

06:49:51,400 --> 06:50:01,900

6946
06:50:11,320 --> 06:50:13,000

6947
06:50:13,000 --> 06:50:15,080
Look kid, this is nothing personal, okay?

6948
06:50:16,700 --> 06:50:18,360
Put the gun down, Trumble.

6949
06:50:19,420 --> 06:50:20,140
And then what, huh?

6950
06:50:20,680 --> 06:50:21,120

6951
06:50:21,400 --> 06:50:22,460

The feds will be kicking down my door within the week!

6953
06:50:26,140 --> 06:50:28,300
It's no surprise that it's Marvin, guys.

6954
06:50:29,660 --> 06:50:31,120
Nothing personal, kid.

6955
06:50:32,060 --> 06:50:34,100
I'm culpable for all this shit.

6956
06:50:35,360 --> 06:50:35,840
I know.

6957
06:50:36,100 --> 06:50:36,800

06:50:59,040 --> 06:51:06,300
hell she already tried she was getting real chatty with that
pretty boy officer I tried to stop him from coming.

6961
06:51:06,560 --> 06:51:08,040
I kept telling him to leave.

6962
06:51:08,840 --> 06:51:09,860
Well, he didn't leave, did he?

6963
06:51:10,200 --> 06:51:11,300
And neither did you.

6964
06:51:13,360 --> 06:51:14,620
And now it's too late.

6965
06:51:15,860 --> 06:51:16,500
Who was that?

6966
06:51:17,180 --> 06:51:17,860
No idea.

6967
06:51:20,340 --> 06:51:22,880
If this is some sort of trick, I ain't...

6968
06:51:22,880 --> 06:51:23,020
Oh.

6969
06:51:24,380 --> 06:51:24,900
Julie?

6970
06:51:27,460 --> 06:51:28,440
Where am I?

6971
06:51:31,060 --> 06:51:31,580
Julie!

6972
06:51:34,720 --> 06:51:35,940
You need some help, girl.

6973
06:51:36,620 --> 06:51:36,620
Julie?

6974
06:51:37,060 --> 06:51:37,320
Hey.

6975
06:51:37,680 --> 06:51:38,340
What's going on?

6976
06:51:38,400 --> 06:51:39,340
What are you doing in there?

6977
06:51:40,320 --> 06:51:42,040
I'll tell you if you help me out of this thing.

6978
06:51:42,420 --> 06:51:42,740
Oh, gosh.

6979
06:51:43,420 --> 06:51:43,420
Sorry.

6980
06:51:45,560 --> 06:51:47,300
Is Julie like a secret double agent?

6981
06:51:47,480 --> 06:51:48,100
That would be crazy.

6982
06:51:48,680 --> 06:51:49,680
Tolman, would you give me a hand?

6983
06:51:50,180 --> 06:51:50,480
Sure.

6984
06:51:56,680 --> 06:51:57,040
Okay.

6985
06:51:59,360 --> 06:52:00,960
Julie, I thought you'd been...

6986
06:52:00,960 --> 06:52:02,880
I mean, I came out of the boat ride and you were gone.

6987
06:52:02,960 --> 06:52:03,580
There was blood.

6988
06:52:04,580 --> 06:52:05,360
Something grabbed me.

6989
06:52:05,740 --> 06:52:12,420

They're not trying to kill us.

7000
06:53:39,990 --> 06:53:42,290
They're trying to communicate us by killing us.

7001
06:53:42,910 --> 06:53:47,270
They're trying to communicate us by hitting us and stabbing
us.

7002
06:53:49,530 --> 06:53:51,050
I have experience with this kind of thing.

7003
06:53:51,490 --> 06:53:52,570
Julie, what do you mean by that?

7004
06:53:53,890 --> 06:53:54,330
Mara.

7005
06:53:54,950 --> 06:53:55,510
Something else.

7006
06:53:55,670 --> 06:53:58,390
Natalie Crowe is waiting in Edward Crowe's office.

7007
06:53:59,190 --> 06:54:00,350
Would you go see how she's doing?

7008
06:54:01,170 --> 06:54:01,750
Crowe's daughter?

7009
06:54:01,970 --> 06:54:02,650
Sure, of course.

7010
06:54:03,250 --> 06:54:05,030
I'd love a chance to talk to her, actually.

7011
06:54:06,170 --> 06:54:06,950
You're not...

7012
06:54:07,410 --> 06:54:09,310
One last thing, Arthur Mole.

7013
06:54:09,990 --> 06:54:12,390
He's out in the staff parking area in my white fiesta.

7014
06:54:13,670 --> 06:54:15,270
Would you check on him too?

7015
06:54:15,710 --> 06:54:17,310
I've left him alone way too long.

7016
06:54:18,730 --> 06:54:19,870
Of course, we can do that too.

7017
06:54:20,530 --> 06:54:21,030
Thank you.

7018
06:54:21,650 --> 06:54:22,850
Mara, what are you going to do?

7019
06:54:23,470 --> 06:54:25,170
I'm going to do what I came here to do.

7020
06:54:26,470 --> 06:54:28,190
We'll be waiting by your car, okay?

7021
06:54:30,050 --> 06:54:30,490
Fiesta!

7022
06:54:32,270 --> 06:54:32,710
Okay?

7023
06:54:33,290 --> 06:54:33,730
Thanks.

7024
06:54:34,850 --> 06:54:37,770
I don't think Mara thinks she's getting out of here.

7025
06:54:40,330 --> 06:54:45,050
I think, me thinks, um, Mr. Edward has been, uh, infected.

7026
06:54:47,150 --> 06:54:48,930
Aggressive form of ASL.

7027
06:54:53,250 --> 06:54:54,210
Come along, Mr. Tolman.

7028
06:54:54,450 --> 06:54:55,330
We've got lots to do.

7029
06:54:58,090 --> 06:54:58,670
You're at the end.

7030
06:54:58,730 --> 06:54:59,370
This is so fun.

7031
06:54:59,430 --> 06:55:00,330
Thank you for playing this.

7032
06:55:00,610 --> 06:55:01,130
One last favor.

7033
06:55:01,450 --> 06:55:04,930
After, after you get a piece of paper, check it as soon as
you get access to your inventory.

7034
06:55:05,310 --> 06:55:05,850
Good luck, Minto.

7035
06:55:06,250 --> 06:55:06,810
Thank you!

7036
06:55:07,190 --> 06:55:08,270
Is this the final battle?

7037
06:55:17,260 --> 06:55:19,340
It's held in place by two chains.

7038
06:55:26,010 --> 06:55:26,790
Iki-mash!

7039
06:55:30,130 --> 06:55:32,590
Is this the puddle that he likes or whatever?

7040
06:55:33,350 --> 06:55:34,310
It's a pool of water.

7041
06:55:34,850 --> 06:55:35,490
It looks so clean.

7042
06:55:35,610 --> 06:55:36,210
Is this a spring?

7043
06:55:36,490 --> 06:55:36,670
What?

7044
06:55:36,770 --> 06:55:37,710
Wash my face?

7045
06:55:39,150 --> 06:55:39,750
Why not?

7046
06:55:41,570 --> 06:55:42,670
That feels better.

7047
06:55:42,990 --> 06:55:44,490
I didn't realize how filthy I was.

7048
06:55:46,710 --> 06:55:48,110
Oh, maybe that healed me.

7049
06:55:48,570 --> 06:55:49,430
I wish I could save.

7050
06:55:50,010 --> 06:55:52,550
I don't want to have to go through all this again

7051
06:56:05,820 --> 06:56:21,500
what a thrill what is backwards with darkness and there's
darkness silence with the night what a thrill cute three

7052
06:56:21,500 --> 06:56:29,640
days in a row what are we talking about thank you for the
super that it went by so fast i could barely breathe it but

7053
06:56:29,640 --> 06:56:30,180
thank you

7054
06:56:34,140 --> 06:56:36,140
I could scroll up while I go down.

7055
06:56:37,040 --> 06:56:37,700
Yeah, be a coincidence.

7056
06:56:37,900 --> 06:56:39,240
Thanks for the long streams this week, Minto.

7057
06:56:39,320 --> 06:56:42,920
You've been keeping me company in the long nights when I
can't shut my brain off and nothing could help me more than

7058
06:56:42,920 --> 06:56:43,180
you.

7059
06:56:43,620 --> 06:56:46,060
Eric, I hope you get some good rest.

7060
06:56:59,490 --> 06:57:00,970
It's a pretty long...

7061
06:57:00,970 --> 06:57:02,390
I think we actually could have sung.

7062
06:57:05,270 --> 06:57:05,890
Snake user.

7063
06:57:07,090 --> 06:57:08,110
Look at how long that was.

7064
06:57:13,590 --> 06:57:14,230
Oh yeah.

7065
06:57:14,410 --> 06:57:15,850
They're loading us up, baby.

7066
06:57:19,030 --> 06:57:20,070
Oh yeah.

7067
06:57:20,530 --> 06:57:22,110
Oh, they're loading us up, baby.

7068
06:57:25,310 --> 06:57:26,170
Collection of staff.

7069
06:57:27,290 --> 06:57:28,870
So there is a place to save here.

7070
06:57:30,110 --> 06:57:30,530
Piece of paper.

7071
06:57:31,390 --> 06:57:34,130
Someone's written something here, but I can't make sense of
it.

7072
06:57:34,250 --> 06:57:34,810
It's nonsense.

7073
06:57:36,250 --> 06:57:36,290
Okay.

7074
06:57:37,650 --> 06:57:39,050
Photos taped up on the wall.

7075
06:57:39,670 --> 06:57:41,510
Natalie Crowe, Edward Crowe's daughter.

7076
06:57:42,010 --> 06:57:45,270
Tolman, engineer Crowe put in charge of route excavation.

7077
06:57:46,190 --> 06:57:46,990
of me.

7078
06:57:47,310 --> 06:57:48,290
When did they take this?

7079
06:57:48,650 --> 06:57:55,070
Julie Barron, the lawyer hired Arthur Mole, the teenager who
wanted to photograph the guests?

7080
06:57:56,450 --> 06:57:59,510
Marvin Trumbull, he was responsible for Crow's fake gold
mine.

7081
06:58:00,470 --> 06:58:02,910
Douglas Pike, he was in charge of building the actual theme
park.

7082
06:58:03,590 --> 06:58:04,970
And finally, Harrison James.

7083
06:58:05,870 --> 06:58:07,990
He was the police officer sent to look for Edward Crow.

7084
06:58:13,220 --> 06:58:14,720
It's been left off the hook.

7085
06:58:15,880 --> 06:58:18,460
No call, no, he doesn't want anybody to call him back.

7086
06:58:19,280 --> 06:58:22,080
Five glass vials, each with the same pale green liquid
inside.

7087
06:58:22,620 --> 06:58:23,320
I don't know what they're for.

7088
06:58:23,440 --> 06:58:24,280
I'll leave them alone.

7089
06:58:25,540 --> 06:58:26,240
A shower?

7090
06:58:28,760 --> 06:58:29,500
Wait, my hair...

7091
06:58:30,720 --> 06:58:31,120
Die.

7092
06:58:35,780 --> 06:58:36,580
The purple?

7093
06:58:40,440 --> 06:58:41,300
Oh my god.

7094
06:58:50,180 --> 06:58:51,140
More shotgun shells.

7095
06:58:51,280 --> 06:58:51,480
Okay.

7096
06:58:51,880 --> 06:58:53,320
I know what we're going in with then.

7097
06:58:56,740 --> 06:58:57,140
Intercom.

7098
06:59:00,020 --> 06:59:00,980
A curtain.

7099
06:59:02,860 --> 06:59:02,960
Ooh!

7100
06:59:03,880 --> 06:59:05,380
Oh, I thought that was a flesh suit.

7101
06:59:05,820 --> 06:59:07,620
Guys, I think this is breaking bad.

7102
06:59:09,360 --> 06:59:11,160
It's covered a fine layer of dust.

7103
06:59:11,600 --> 06:59:12,960
I guess he's not wearing it anymore.

7104
06:59:13,200 --> 06:59:14,360
The hazmat suit!

7105
06:59:15,280 --> 06:59:18,060
For Natalie, I won't open it.

7106
06:59:18,720 --> 06:59:19,500
A microwave.

7107
06:59:20,540 --> 06:59:21,960
With Medkit inside.

7108
06:59:22,680 --> 06:59:26,120
I think this is just breaking bad.

7109
06:59:30,410 --> 06:59:32,730
This must have been where Crow has been sleeping.

7110
06:59:32,890 --> 06:59:34,510
The sheets are stained with blood.

7111
06:59:34,690 --> 06:59:36,270
Oh, I think this guy is so infected.

7112
06:59:37,450 --> 06:59:38,250
Bunsen burner.

7113
06:59:40,590 --> 06:59:41,450
Wait, hold on.

7114
06:59:42,010 --> 06:59:43,350
Oh, can I save here?

7115
06:59:43,490 --> 06:59:44,430
Wait, that's crazy.

7116
06:59:49,420 --> 06:59:49,820
Fun!

7117
06:59:53,950 --> 06:59:55,110
Oh, that's so cool.

7118
06:59:56,010 --> 06:59:56,250
Oh, wait.

7119
06:59:56,330 --> 06:59:58,110
I forgot to get this handgun, Emma.

7120
07:00:04,250 --> 07:00:04,650
Oh!

7121
07:00:05,410 --> 07:00:06,490
It's an elevator.

7122
07:00:08,410 --> 07:00:09,910
way to get up to the surface.

7123
07:00:12,070 --> 07:00:13,590
It doesn't work anymore.

7124
07:00:14,950 --> 07:00:17,990
Because someone's driven a fire axe through the control
panel.

7125
07:00:20,870 --> 07:00:23,070
Alright, I think I got everything there is to get.

7126
07:00:24,990 --> 07:00:25,470
Um.

7127
07:00:28,550 --> 07:00:29,470
I think so.

7128
07:00:29,770 --> 07:00:29,950
Okay.

7129
07:00:33,370 --> 07:00:35,270
It always comes back to Breaking Bad.

7130
07:00:35,910 --> 07:00:37,630
Mr. Crowe, I'm here.

7131
07:00:37,710 --> 07:00:38,510
I'm in your lab.

7132
07:00:39,130 --> 07:00:40,210
Hello, Elaine.

7133
07:00:45,330 --> 07:00:56,570

don't know what first I need to free up some space to put

7135
07:01:08,190 --> 07:01:11,970
down the other objects I'm carrying The twist!

7136
07:01:14,130 --> 07:01:14,930
Glass vials.

7137
07:01:15,250 --> 07:01:16,470
All my stuff!

7138
07:01:18,130 --> 07:01:20,050
Left in their place all the other items I collected.

7139
07:01:20,830 --> 07:01:22,930
The police ID card I took from Harrison James.

7140
07:01:23,530 --> 07:01:25,470
The bronze key given to me by a fairy.

7141
07:01:26,230 --> 07:01:27,850
The crank handle I found in a safe.

7142
07:01:28,470 --> 07:01:29,950
This is so emotional!

7143
07:01:30,370 --> 07:01:34,150
I've never thought of, you know, like when you're done with
a game and you're getting rid of all your items you don't

7144
07:01:34,150 --> 07:01:36,130
need anymore, like...

7145
07:01:36,130 --> 07:01:38,550
You think of your journey and you're just like, Ah!

7146
07:01:40,350 --> 07:01:41,510
Refresh me, who was Elaine?

7147
07:01:41,950 --> 07:01:48,510
Elaine was the girl that was the girl who got attacked and
got the uh, the park closed down.

7148
07:01:48,610 --> 07:01:49,090
Wait a second.

7149
07:01:49,270 --> 07:01:50,350
So she's the idiot.

7150
07:01:51,030 --> 07:01:52,730
That's why she said she was stupid.

7151
07:01:53,730 --> 07:01:54,870
She actually is dumb.

7152
07:01:57,410 --> 07:01:59,810
The ruby gemstone that was hidden in a painting of a demon.

7153
07:02:00,670 --> 07:02:02,950
The chain I took from the neck of a mechanical swan.

7154
07:02:05,170 --> 07:02:08,010
The mask I excavated from a block of resin.

7155
07:02:08,750 --> 07:02:10,190
The trident I took out of a witch's.

7156
07:02:10,210 --> 07:02:17,710
cauldron the silver key that was hidden in Neptune's palace
the data disk I got from the change machine in an arcade the

7157
07:02:17,710 --> 07:02:24,650
acid bottle I took from a cell in a dungeon the golden key I
found trapped inside a fairy's head the battery I pulled

7158
07:02:24,650 --> 07:02:28,470
from the stomach of a robotic mermaid good times

7159
07:02:34,330 --> 07:02:40,670
all right I don't think there's anything else in here for me
to grab so I think we're good.

7160
07:02:41,490 --> 07:02:41,810
Oh, wait.

7161
07:02:44,750 --> 07:02:46,110
Mr. Crowe, I have the vials.

7162
07:02:46,390 --> 07:02:46,870
Open the door.

7163
07:02:47,170 --> 07:02:48,210
Stand back.

7164
07:02:52,080 --> 07:02:53,060
Check the paper?

7165
07:02:55,100 --> 07:02:55,800
This one?

7166
07:02:58,240 --> 07:03:00,420
Someone's written something here, but I can't make sense of
it.

7167
07:03:00,500 --> 07:03:00,980
It's nonsense.

7168
07:03:02,560 --> 07:03:03,380
Still won't let me.

7169
07:03:07,030 --> 07:03:08,750
I just have the glass vials now.

7170
07:03:21,510 --> 07:03:22,430
What do you mean, infected?

7171
07:03:22,570 --> 07:03:23,270
Don't say that!

7172
07:03:24,470 --> 07:03:24,930
Infected!

7173
07:03:27,950 --> 07:03:29,230
I'm confused.

7174
07:03:31,990 --> 07:03:33,770
There we go.

7175
07:03:34,570 --> 07:03:35,190
The health?

7176
07:03:36,290 --> 07:03:37,090
Oh, you're right.

7177
07:03:37,430 --> 07:03:38,410
Wait, when did that happen?

7178
07:03:39,110 --> 07:03:40,110
Wait, condition infected.

7179
07:03:45,020 --> 07:03:45,800
Oh, mister.

7180
07:03:49,800 --> 07:03:51,000
Elaine Marshall.

7181
07:03:53,800 --> 07:03:54,540
Edward Crow.

7182
07:03:56,800 --> 07:03:58,320
It happened...

7183
07:03:59,420 --> 07:04:00,960
it happened when we got attacked, no?

7184
07:04:01,320 --> 07:04:03,240
Yeah, she's been affected since she got attacked, I think.

7185
07:04:03,600 --> 07:04:04,420
How long has it been?

7186
07:04:04,540 --> 07:04:05,180
Two years?

7187
07:04:06,200 --> 07:04:07,320
We've never met before.

7188
07:04:08,160 --> 07:04:09,780
No, I mean, since you became infected.

7189
07:04:10,020 --> 07:04:10,560
Two years.

7190
07:04:11,140 --> 07:04:13,400
Yeah, two years since I shut the park.

7191
07:04:14,600 --> 07:04:15,640
I'm glad you came back.

7192
07:04:17,140 --> 07:04:18,200
Why would you give a shit?

7193
07:04:18,860 --> 07:04:22,080
I would offer you a drink, but what are you now, 18?

7194
07:04:22,780 --> 07:04:23,400
Not quite.

7195
07:04:24,080 --> 07:04:26,240
And yet, you made it all the way down here.

7196
07:04:26,900 --> 07:04:28,320
You're clearly very stubborn.

7197
07:04:28,420 --> 07:04:31,740
I see these I see these traps on the side.

7198
07:04:34,100 --> 07:04:34,820
That's good.

7199
07:04:35,120 --> 07:04:35,840
It gives me hope.

7200
07:04:37,980 --> 07:04:38,180
Tell me.

7201
07:04:38,300 --> 07:04:39,060
How are you feeling?

7202
07:04:39,840 --> 07:04:40,180
Bad.

7203
07:04:40,660 --> 07:04:40,920
Tired.

7204
07:04:41,060 --> 07:04:42,140
Oh, yeah, me too.

7205
07:04:44,760 --> 07:04:46,560
They can't get rid of my infection.

7206
07:04:47,440 --> 07:04:48,420
It's been getting worse.

7207
07:04:49,080 --> 07:04:49,620
Of course.

7208
07:04:51,580 --> 07:04:52,000
Hold on.

7209
07:04:58,120 --> 07:05:01,420
I must say, I'm relieved they let you out of the hospital
long enough to.

7210
07:05:01,800 --> 07:05:02,420
They didn't.

7211
07:05:04,720 --> 07:05:05,480
I see.

7212
07:05:06,140 --> 07:05:07,380
You really are determined.

7213
07:05:08,440 --> 07:05:09,220
And all this?

7214
07:05:09,980 --> 07:05:11,820
Because you want to kill me, I assume?

7215
07:05:13,240 --> 07:05:13,720
No.

7216
07:05:14,860 --> 07:05:17,180
I came because I want to tell you something face to face.

7217
07:05:17,980 --> 07:05:19,180
I need you to know.

7218
07:05:19,860 --> 07:05:20,540
Go on.

7219
07:05:21,580 --> 07:05:23,560
Mr. Crow, I'm going to die from this infection.

7220
07:05:24,520 --> 07:05:25,320
We tried everything.

7221
07:05:25,400 --> 07:05:26,100
Nothing works.

7222
07:05:26,480 --> 07:05:27,580
It's going to kill me.

7223
07:05:29,020 --> 07:05:30,620
But I didn't realize you have it too?

7224
07:05:31,040 --> 07:05:31,900
The same infection?

7225
07:05:32,920 --> 07:05:33,540
Of course.

7226
07:05:33,860 --> 07:05:36,640
Anyone who has been exposed to the guests will have it.

7227
07:05:36,720 --> 07:05:39,200
Oh no, that means our baddie lawyer.

7228
07:05:40,120 --> 07:05:40,500
Julie.

7229
07:05:41,280 --> 07:05:42,520
Naturally, I was the first.

7230
07:05:43,320 --> 07:05:46,200
When the first guest emerged from the pool, I tried to help
him.

7231
07:05:46,980 --> 07:05:51,160
I put him in a holding cell, up on the ground level, so he
could monitor him more easily.

7232
07:05:53,020 --> 07:05:54,640
A holding cell, that's where I was attacked.

7233
07:05:55,400 --> 07:05:58,880
Yes, bringing the guests up to the surface proved to be a
mistake.

7234
07:05:59,720 --> 07:06:02,060
But you, you look worse than I do.

7235
07:06:03,860 --> 07:06:12,000
am simply further along my continued exposure to the guests
has accelerated the process continued exposure your bloody

7236
07:06:12,000 --> 07:06:21,160
escapade today and may prove to have a similar effect for
you oh god it looks bad what's it like when it gets that bad

7237
07:06:21,160 --> 07:06:36,390
I shall not lie to you Elaine do you remember when your
family asked me to pay your medical fees oh no That's why

7238
07:06:36,390 --> 07:06:37,690
her hair is a picture.

7239
07:06:38,570 --> 07:06:42,010
Now her hair is like that blonde, but she had it as purple.

7240
07:06:45,010 --> 07:06:47,890
They're holding you accountable since I was injured in your
park.

7241
07:06:48,930 --> 07:06:49,750
Well, you never paid them.

7242
07:06:49,950 --> 07:06:52,090
My lawyer is trying to take you to court over it.

7243
07:06:52,750 --> 07:06:55,350
Yes, this was a deliberate decision on my part.

7244
07:06:56,930 --> 07:06:58,530
No, it was a deliberate decision.

7245
07:06:58,830 --> 07:07:01,970
Knowing the nature of your illness, I knew there could be no
cure found at the hospital.

7246
07:07:02,910 --> 07:07:03,190
Wait.

7247
07:07:04,290 --> 07:07:05,170
But there is a cure.

7248
07:07:05,330 --> 07:07:06,610
I made one.

7249
07:07:07,210 --> 07:07:07,810
You help.

7250
07:07:08,310 --> 07:07:10,010
I had to reverse-engineer it.

7251
07:07:11,090 --> 07:07:14,870
I've been studying the highly infectious bacteria on the
dead bodies of the guests.

7252
07:07:15,750 --> 07:07:18,290
New kinds of bacteria that nobody knows about yet.

7253
07:07:20,630 --> 07:07:21,390
That's been the problem.

7254
07:07:22,030 --> 07:07:23,950
It's no surprise your doctors were stumped.

7255
07:07:25,870 --> 07:07:27,510
Those vials from your lab?

7256
07:07:28,430 --> 07:07:28,730
Yes.

7257
07:07:29,170 --> 07:07:31,570
You have the cure on your person at this very moment.

7258
07:07:32,430 --> 07:07:33,050
Five vials.

7259
07:07:33,210 --> 07:07:34,750
Enough to cure five people.

7260
07:07:35,470 --> 07:07:35,910
Five.

7261
07:07:38,070 --> 07:07:39,550
Harrison and Marvin are dead.

7262
07:07:41,290 --> 07:07:44,990
So that leaves you, me, Natalie, Tolman, Julie, and Arthur.

7263
07:07:47,450 --> 07:07:48,230
That's six people.

7264
07:07:48,610 --> 07:07:49,730
You didn't make enough vials!

7265
07:07:51,270 --> 07:07:52,670
I don't think he's getting out, though.

7266
07:07:52,870 --> 07:07:53,570
You're wrong, Lair.

7267
07:07:53,890 --> 07:07:55,530
I shall not be taking the cure.

7268
07:07:57,370 --> 07:07:59,090
You understand where we are right now.

7269
07:07:59,990 --> 07:08:01,050
You call it the pool.

7270
07:08:02,310 --> 07:08:02,950
Ha ha ha ha.

7271
07:08:05,330 --> 07:08:13,370
are seven roots what's left of them after years of you
cutting them up harvesting them for gold exactly right

7272
07:08:13,370 --> 07:08:24,670
Elaine look at me listen the pool is a gay boy sorry and the
guests are human beings who are who attempted to travel

7273
07:08:24,670 --> 07:08:35,430
through it and emerged here why do they look so why are they
so messed up because I have spent the last ten years

7274
07:08:35,430 --> 07:08:48,070
dismantling the mechanism of that gateway I don't understand
you're making me yawn too I'm sorry no I don't say yawn the

7275
07:08:50,010 --> 07:08:59,170
pool still works technically but thanks to me it is severely
malfunctioning you see the roots are kind of a calibration

7276
07:08:59,170 --> 07:09:08,870
antenna necessary to accurate accurately and safely
transport those who travel through the pool Mr. Krill, where

7277
07:09:08,870 --> 07:09:09,710
are they coming from?

7278
07:09:10,290 --> 07:09:10,710
The guests.

7279
07:09:12,150 --> 07:09:13,390
What's on the other side of the pool?

7280
07:09:18,820 --> 07:09:23,020
You understand now how my excavations have been causing the
mutations of the guests.

7281
07:09:23,720 --> 07:09:28,140
And also understand the mutations have been getting worse as
I cut down more of the roots.

7282
07:09:30,000 --> 07:09:33,340
The beings that emerge from the pool now, they barely
resemble humans at all.

7283
07:09:34,600 --> 07:09:36,840
Most of them cannot walk, let alone speak.

7284
07:09:39,680 --> 07:09:41,260
from the pool all that time ago.

7285
07:09:41,420 --> 07:09:42,540
He was the least mutated.

7286
07:09:43,220 --> 07:09:44,980
No, yes, Elaine.

7287
07:09:45,820 --> 07:09:46,660
He could speak.

7288
07:09:48,220 --> 07:09:48,980
Just barely.

7289
07:09:52,480 --> 07:09:55,260
He told me who he was and why he had come.

7290
07:09:56,400 --> 07:09:57,820
He wrote it down word for word.

7291
07:09:58,120 --> 07:10:00,140
Oh, I wrote it down on a little piece of paper.

7292
07:10:01,060 --> 07:10:03,560
And then I went back to harvesting the roots.

7293
07:10:07,750 --> 07:10:10,890
No subsequent guests were capable of speech.

7294
07:10:11,790 --> 07:10:14,790
You may now understand why I'm choosing not to take the
cure.

7295
07:10:16,330 --> 07:10:17,090
My time is short.

7296
07:10:18,030 --> 07:10:19,990
Before I die, I must look upon what I have wrought.

7297
07:10:21,650 --> 07:10:23,190
You're going through the pool?

7298
07:10:25,030 --> 07:10:26,030
Hold out your hand.

7299
07:10:26,410 --> 07:10:26,590
What?

7300
07:10:28,230 --> 07:10:28,890
Take it.

7301
07:10:29,410 --> 07:10:30,550
It's a little piece of paper.

7302
07:10:33,430 --> 07:10:37,410
Now that it is in your hands, I am going through the pool.

7303
07:10:38,350 --> 07:10:39,150
He'll be mutated.

7304
07:10:39,270 --> 07:10:39,990
It'll kill you.

7305
07:10:41,190 --> 07:10:42,310
A fitting end.

7306
07:10:42,930 --> 07:10:43,670
I can't check it.

7307
07:10:44,030 --> 07:10:45,310
We're still in the dialogue, guys.

7308
07:10:47,190 --> 07:10:51,370
Perhaps if I am lucky, I may get a glimpse of what lies on
the other side.

7309
07:10:52,890 --> 07:10:56,430
I feel like he's going to mutate and we'll have to fight
him.

7310
07:10:57,210 --> 07:10:58,690
I have one more thing to ask of you, Elaine.

7311
07:11:00,050 --> 07:11:03,630
If for any reason I reemerge from the pool, I want you to
kill me.

7312
07:11:03,730 --> 07:11:05,950
Oh, that's what I literally just said.

7313
07:11:07,910 --> 07:11:11,030
But if I reemerge, I will be in no shape to continue living.

7314
07:11:11,050 --> 07:11:13,750
Do you understand?

7315
07:11:15,350 --> 07:11:15,990
Goodbye, Elaine.

7316
07:11:16,730 --> 07:11:18,270
I raise a glass to your future.

7317
07:11:24,280 --> 07:11:24,420
Whoa!

7318
07:11:34,390 --> 07:11:36,730
I still won't let me check my inventory.

7319
07:11:39,990 --> 07:11:40,530
Uh...

7320
07:11:51,400 --> 07:11:54,660
A small piece of paper given to me by Edward Crowe.

7321
07:11:55,320 --> 07:11:56,320
It's folded in half.

7322
07:11:58,260 --> 07:11:59,340
2106 uninhabitable.

7323
07:11:59,460 --> 07:11:59,800
ruined.

7324
07:12:00,040 --> 07:12:03,660
We come 1988, last chance, warn, stop, change.

7325
07:12:09,170 --> 07:12:10,130
So they're from the future?

7326
07:12:10,590 --> 07:12:11,530
And it's uninhabitable?

7327
07:12:12,530 --> 07:12:17,870
And so they came back to to warn everybody.

7328
07:12:23,880 --> 07:12:26,420
Yeah, the number on the wall was 2106.

7329
07:12:29,160 --> 07:12:29,520
Yeah.

7330
07:12:37,110 --> 07:12:37,930
Okay, ouch.

7331
07:12:38,070 --> 07:12:38,390
Ouch, ouch.

7332
07:12:38,550 --> 07:12:39,830
Wait, I need to shoot these real quick.

7333
07:12:45,150 --> 07:12:47,250
Sorry, you scared me.

7334
07:12:51,830 --> 07:12:53,010
Okay, now I'm good.

7335
07:13:01,760 --> 07:13:04,040
Wait, where's my...

7336
07:13:11,650 --> 07:13:12,670
Where is it, please?

7337
07:13:12,990 --> 07:13:13,530
Where is it?

7338
07:13:14,070 --> 07:13:14,530
Where is it?

7339
07:13:14,830 --> 07:13:15,030
There.

7340
07:13:16,910 --> 07:13:17,690
Oh my god.

7341
07:13:18,090 --> 07:13:18,250
Run?

7342
07:13:27,070 --> 07:13:28,670
The music is kind of crazy though.

7343
07:13:30,530 --> 07:13:31,450
What's he doing?

7344
07:13:35,910 --> 07:13:36,430
Eki!

7345
07:13:39,970 --> 07:13:40,810
What's he doing?

7346
07:13:41,230 --> 07:13:41,770
Where'd he go?

7347
07:13:41,950 --> 07:13:42,950
Oh, there he is.

7348
07:13:45,890 --> 07:13:49,290
Oh my god, please, where's my... Where's my... There we go.

7349
07:13:54,740 --> 07:13:56,440
Oh my god, my aim.

7350
07:13:57,120 --> 07:13:57,120
Oh,

7351
07:14:00,180 --> 07:14:01,120
it's getting real bloody.

7352
07:14:14,750 --> 07:14:15,630
Where is he?

7353
07:14:15,790 --> 07:14:16,230
Where is it?

7354
07:14:16,410 --> 07:14:16,750
Where is it?

7355
07:14:17,190 --> 07:14:17,590
There it is.

7356
07:14:25,790 --> 07:14:26,190
Oh!

7357
07:14:27,030 --> 07:14:28,350
You won't get me.

7358
07:14:32,010 --> 07:14:33,090
It's pretty nasty.

7359
07:14:33,370 --> 07:14:34,490
Okay, I gotta change my gun.

7360
07:14:35,930 --> 07:14:37,170
I wonder if I could flamethrower him.

7361
07:14:38,650 --> 07:14:39,710
I'm just gonna...

7362
07:14:39,730 --> 07:14:49,770

Yeah, okay.

7369
07:15:27,340 --> 07:15:28,200
It's over.

7370
07:15:28,740 --> 07:15:31,100
There's only one thing left to do.

7371
07:15:32,560 --> 07:15:32,600
Wait.

7372
07:15:33,080 --> 07:15:35,220
We'll do it with the handgun, at least.

7373
07:15:43,800 --> 07:15:44,140
Oh!

7374
07:15:47,420 --> 07:15:49,820
But then I take the cure, and we're fine!

7375
07:15:53,890 --> 07:15:54,490
Yes.

7376
07:15:57,890 --> 07:16:04,830
Snake and boss I totally thought it too Everyone else is
drinking the potion

7377
07:16:09,370 --> 07:16:22,310
Crow country Four miles Staring into the flames I feel
something It's a curious mixture of hope and dread Oh yeah I

7378
07:16:22,310 --> 07:16:25,210
wonder what it tastes like Maybe everything will be okay

7379
07:16:28,790 --> 07:16:30,950
I did take her Natalie's shoes.

7380
07:16:31,790 --> 07:16:32,830
And maybe it won't.

7381
07:16:33,790 --> 07:16:37,350
I wish we had at least taken the letter for Natalie to give
to her, you know.

7382
07:16:38,930 --> 07:16:39,450
Yay!

7383

I feel like I spent most of my time running away, but...

7388
07:16:58,550 --> 07:16:59,670
That is part of one of the...

7389
07:16:59,670 --> 07:17:00,470
That is...

7390
07:17:00,470 --> 07:17:02,250
That's part of the territory for these people.

7391
07:17:02,270 --> 07:17:11,090

07:21:28,970 --> 07:21:29,410

I'm sorry!

7463
07:21:39,030 --> 07:21:40,170
How did I miss that?

7464
07:21:40,650 --> 07:21:42,650
Oh my gosh, I must have been really locked in with the game.

7465
07:21:43,110 --> 07:21:44,190
Thank you so much!

7466
07:21:44,430 --> 07:21:45,550
Thank you, I'm sorry!

07:21:49,710 --> 07:21:50,270
And a collab.

7469
07:21:51,510 --> 07:21:53,130
You work longer than my work shifts.

7470
07:21:53,430 --> 07:21:55,870
Keep it up until the New Year's to 50 games of 2025.

7471
07:21:56,470 --> 07:21:56,870
Yeah!

7472
07:21:59,090 --> 07:22:00,490
I was so locked in.

7473
07:22:00,550 --> 07:22:01,150
I'm sorry.

7474
07:22:01,330 --> 07:22:02,010
Oh my goodness.

7475
07:22:04,330 --> 07:22:05,770

7476
07:22:05,830 --> 07:22:13,490
Thanks very much me though of course thank you next thank
you always thank you always always always it's a good game

7477
07:22:13,490 --> 07:22:20,570
though it is a good game I really enjoyed it I didn't know
what the storyline would be at all I was wondering if it was

7478
07:22:20,570 --> 07:22:33,510
like zombies or like what's that what's that guy that does
all the like serial killer type games with the name it's

7479
07:22:33,510 --> 07:22:34,890
like on the tip of my tongue

7480
07:22:38,210 --> 07:22:39,130
Puppet combo.

7481
07:22:40,110 --> 07:22:40,610
Puppet combo.

7482
07:22:42,790 --> 07:22:45,250
So I wasn't sure if it was like that kind of game or what.

7483
07:22:45,990 --> 07:22:46,970
It was Breaking Bad.

7484
07:22:47,290 --> 07:22:48,890
It was Breaking Bad.

7485
07:22:53,290 --> 07:22:54,670
Turns out it was sci-fi.

7486
07:22:55,030 --> 07:22:55,830
That's so awesome.

7531
07:25:51,430 --> 07:25:55,570
The game that we chose, I don't...

7532
07:25:55,570 --> 07:25:56,470
I asked about it.

7533
07:25:56,530 --> 07:25:59,390
I've never played it before, so I don't know if it's like a
stream.

7534
07:25:59,910 --> 07:26:01,710
Everybody POV type thing or not.

07:26:03,790 --> 07:26:06,890

7536
07:26:07,850 --> 07:26:09,070

Yeah, yeah.

7538
07:26:13,290 --> 07:26:14,350
So, Denzetsu Beasties.

7539
07:26:14,810 --> 07:26:16,390
I think they responded actually.

7540
07:26:17,070 --> 07:26:17,430
Up to us.

7541
07:26:17,610 --> 07:26:18,910
The game works by one person.

7542
07:26:19,170 --> 07:26:20,430
Oh, ah.

7543
07:26:22,610 --> 07:26:25,470
Oh, it's like a jackbox game, but more wholesome.

7544
07:26:25,730 --> 07:26:26,310
Oh, okay.

7545
07:26:35,640 --> 07:26:41,180
Okay, I think what we are thinking about is doing one
Denzetsu POV and one Beasties POV.

7546
07:26:41,900 --> 07:26:44,540
So, that might work.

7547
07:26:48,310 --> 07:26:50,970
But yeah, that's the schedule.

7548
07:26:51,250 --> 07:26:52,750
It'll be up tomorrow.

7549
07:26:53,970 --> 07:26:55,790
Once we solidify stuff.

7550
07:26:56,370 --> 07:26:57,210
