Hi, hi, hi, hi, welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,580

6
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,160

7
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,360

10
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,460
How's your hunkin' with you?

11
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,720

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,630
Thank you!

13
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,590
I'm my mother man, thank you!

14
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,270
Hello?

15
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,610
Wayne says.

16
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,410
My favorite Goose...

17
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,270
Wait, my favorite streamer is back.

18
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:53,890
Goose Phantom.

19
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,210
I keep reading this as Goose House.

20
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,690
You know the Kimi da yo, Kimi nanda yo Ossie te kura ta
group.

21
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,650
I keep reading Goose House.

22
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,210
No advice for today.

23
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,890
I ran out, but I hope your throat is feeling better.

24
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,310
I have lots of fun at home at.

25
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,370
Thank you.

26
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,430
Can we get a Moe.

27
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,730
Moe.

28
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,710
Haak!

29
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,790
Oh, I forgot my...

30
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,470
My controller.

31
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,890
I feel like this is more of a controller game, right?

32
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,790
I feel like this is more of a controller game because...

33
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,570
It came out originally in...

34
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:31,930
What was it?

35
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,250
Maybe?

36
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,470
Haak!

37
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,570
Haak!

38
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,090
Haak!

39
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,430
Haak!

40
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,170
Haak!

41
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,530
Very much so.

42
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,190
Okay, cool.

43
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,310
Thank goodness they're a hawk.

44
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,550
It's better with controller.

45
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,630
Okay, cool.

46
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,650
Hikaru-na-ra is a banger.

47
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,410
It is.

48
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,270
I agree.

49
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,690
How are you feeling today, Minto?

50
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,270
I'm so good.

51
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,270
I'm so good.

52
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,110
I'm so nervous.

53
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,410
I get nervous before, like, events and stuff.

54
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:13,570
So, and this weekend I will be at Holiday Matsuri in
Orlando, Florida.

55
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:15,950
And...

56
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,850
I have lots going on there.

57
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,250
I have a collab with a maid cafe.

58
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,370
I have a meet and greet.

59
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,830
I have a panel with Doki Bird.

60
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,930
I have a concert appearance.

61
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,090
And I have another meet and greet.

62
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,750
And I think that's everything that I have.

63
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,070
Oh my gosh, thank you guys for all the super chats.

64
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,610
Thank you.

65
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,210
Now that you have a manager and team, would you consider
opening a PO box in the future?

66
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,690
Ah!

67
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,290
They said the...

68
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:55,190
they will they said that they will start accepting things on
our behalf I only asked because I have a Koharu garage kit

69
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:03,910
why do you have her are you sure that I can have her I got
my wisdom teeth removed and watching you makes me feel much

70
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:15,850
so much better willies feel better feel better well isn't
like the gas I've I want to know what I would be like on the

71
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,530
laughing gas.

72
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,110
Minto builds garage kits?

73
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,470
No, actually, I have like a couple that are just kind of
sitting in a box because I wanted to buy them.

74
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:34,150
Because garage kits typically, like, a lot of times it'll be
like figures of characters that would never, ever get a

75
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,530
figure.

76
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,730
And so I'll buy a garage kit of it.

77
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:43,270
And then I'll kind of sit on it and be like, one day I'll
take this to a hobby shop and pass it along to somebody who

78
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,210
would be more skilled than all.

79
00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:02,690
my poor metal kit i know i wonder what i would be like on
the laughing guys they put me all the way out when i got my

80
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:12,410
wisdom teeth out still came halfway back during the
procedure that's scary that's scary one time i feel like

81
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:18,090
though i think i had a cavity and they were drill they gave
me the numbing and they drew started drilling and then i

82
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,210
kept feeling it

83
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,150
It's not quite the same.

84
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,710
Scary.

85
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,870
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

86
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,430
It was pretty bad.

87
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,230
I was like, oh, ouchy.

88
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,770
Ouchy, ouchy.

89
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,910
Thank you.

90
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,750
Also, so many memos coming back.

91
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,590
Thank you.

92
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,270
Good night, Minky, and chat, because I have to wakey-wakey
in five hours.

93
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,030
Good night, Rafa!

94
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,830
Good night, good night.

95
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,750
You need to pay child support for all the people you got
pregnant from Santa Baby cover last year.

96
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,210
That's more than a year.

97
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,570
Wouldn't it be nine months?

98
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,250
Wouldn't it be if there were any pregnancies, but I've seen
no proof?

99
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,890
I've been told, oh, Minto, I'm pregnant.

100
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,830
Minto, I'm gonna have a baby.

101
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,590
Minto, you're the father.

102
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,430
But I've seen no proof!

103
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,410
I think I'm getting scammed.

104
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,690
I think you guys are all setting me up for...

105
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:41,590
I think you've set up this elaborate scheme where you rob me
of my money.

106
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,590
Which is kind of you guys' money.

107
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,810
That's how I make money.

108
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,750
Wait.

109
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,390
Pay the child support, Minto.

110
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,790
Minto is 200% baby, though.

111
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,090
It's been nine months.

112
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,270
Oh my gosh, Terry, it's been nine months.

113
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,710
I'm afraid it's been nine months.

114
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,370
Congratulations on the babies.

115
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,350
Where are they?

116
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,450
Where are they?

117
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,070
Where are they?

118
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,610
Where are they?

119
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,110
Where are they?

120
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:17,670

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,390
I take flight.

180
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,970
America's next top goose.

181
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,010
Wait, you want to be on top?

182
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,130
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

183
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,710
Bum, bum, bum.

184
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,750
You want to be on top.

185
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,090
Wait, what did I say?

186
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,810
Bend down to pick things up off the ground.

187
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,890
Oh, you want to be on top?

188
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,870
You want to be on top?

189
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,530
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

190
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,240
The way he walks is so cute.

191
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,560
Hank!

192
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,080
Can I jump?

193
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,780
Can I fly?

194
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,040
I can sneak around.

195
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,540
Columbus sailed in 1892, so Americans were...

196
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,080
Found by good old Chris.

197
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,460
Mm-hmm.

198
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,760
Christmas.

199
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,780
Jolly old Saint Nick.

200
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,120
Yes.

201
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,560
This is the world's smartest goose.

202
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,960
Wait, open up.

203
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,260
Oh.

204
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,400
Good enough.

205
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,840
It was very poorly constructed.

206
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,520
Definitely not my fault.

207
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,400
Spread your wings and fly.

208
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,460
Oh.

209
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,720
Cute!

210
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,120
So, wow, I'm zooming.

211
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,140
That might be the fastest goose alive.

212
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,720
Oh, it's because I was hitting run.

213
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,620
Title car!

214
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,320
Oh, I'm stuck.

215
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,780
I was stuck.

216
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,700
It's implied your wings are clipped.

217
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,540
Who did this to me?

218
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,860
Is that why I hate humans?

219
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,100
Is that why I must cause them grief?

220
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,940
Who is here?

221
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,940
I like this.

222
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,740
I like that a lot.

223
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,860
Take revenge on society.

224
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,720
I'm an angry goose.

225
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
What's going on here?

226
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,760
I can't read anything.

227
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm a goose.

228
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,360
Press back to see her.

229
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,560
Oh, to do.

230
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,640
Get into the garden.

231
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,640
Get the groundskeeper wet.

232
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,520
Steal the groundskeeper.

233
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:13,440
make the groundskeeper's keys, make the groundskeeper wear
his sun hat, rake the lake, have a picnic, bring to the

234
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,280
picnic blanket, sandwich apples, pumpkin, carrot, dam,
thermos, radio basket.

235
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,400
Can I hop over?

236
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,190
Oh, but I can't even get on it.

237
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,350
Hmm.

238
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,630
That'll be...

239
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,930
Yeah!

240
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,730
Now we're gardening.

241
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm just assisting, honestly.

242
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,920
Grab him.

243
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,640
Grab his keys.

244
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,140
Grab his keys.

245
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Did I get him?

246
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,400
Grab his keys.

247
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,540
Grab his keys.

248
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,500
Grab his keys.

249
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,540
Grab his keys.

250
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,400
Wait.

251
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,780
I'm running inside?

252
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,740
Wait.

253
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,320
I can run inside now.

254
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

255
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,900
Hey, hey!

256
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,500
Hey, hey!

257
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,920
Yes.

258
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,640
Yes.

259
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,200
Pumpkin.

260
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,620
I need to take this.

261
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,280
This is very important.

262
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,280
Hey.

263
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,320
No, no, no, you don't understand, sir.

264
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,220
You don't understand!

265
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:47,900
Oh!

266
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,940
You don't understand!

267
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,980
The world depends on me!

268
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,660
I wish I didn't.

269
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,320
Go with such a...

270
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,380
I want to get him wet.

271
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,470
Where'd the radio go?

272
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,730
He took it?

273
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,130
That bastard.

274
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,390
I did see some stuff over here though.

275
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,170
Hold on, let's see.

276
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,030
What we got going on?

277
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,270
Wait.

278
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,150
No, no.

279
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,070
Wait, turn around.

280
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,550
I saw like... Oh, here, here.

281
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,190
What did I need to bring?

282
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:37,650
Sandwich.

283
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,470
Oh, I do need to bring the basket.

284
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,570
It's mine now.

285
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,510
Finders keepers?

286
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,300
Run.

287
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,820
It's like such a wide turn.

288
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,790
What's he doing anyway?

289
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,990
What am I doing in here?

290
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,870
Make him wear a sun hat.

291
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,830
Rake in the lake.

292
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,150
Where's the rake anyway?

293
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,210
Oh, I...

294
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,390
Oh, oh, oh.

295
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,910
Thank you so much for that, thank you so much, thank you.

296
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,330
Tactical goose action?

297
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,250
You know it.

298
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,910
I suppose to get him to wear his hat.

299
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,680
Is it break time?

300
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,220
Uh oh.

301
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,380
Wait, we need to hurry.

302
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,980
We need to get, we need to skedaddle.

303
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,300
He didn't notice at all.

304
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,560
What an idiot!

305
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,100
NAHHA!

306
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,880
NAHHA!

307
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,600
NAH!

308
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:11,760
NAH!

309
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,200
What else is there?

310
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,740
Um...

311
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,240
The apple.

312
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,520
I forgot the apple.

313
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,480
Nice.

314
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,480
And the basket.

315
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,580
Yes.

316
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,460
Who's running?

317
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,700
Oh, it's my feet.

318
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,300
Okay, good.

319
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,820
Break status.

320
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:46,640
Laked.

321
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,580
Absolutely.

322
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,400
Okay.

323
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Apple, devoured.

324
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,680
Pumpkin, carrot, jam, thermos...

325
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,560
Oh, the radio!

326
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,340
I think that might be the last thing we get.

327
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,560
The daily life of wild, Minto.

328
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,060
Sorry.

329
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,060
For my picnic?

330
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,540
I sure skip... Oh, wrong way.

331
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,760
Turn around.

332
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,360
Turn around, goose.

333
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:35,980
Turn around.

334
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,540
There we go.

335
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,860
I sure scared him.

336
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,300
I think maybe when we...

337
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,640
Thank you so much for the thank you.

338
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,460
Thank you.

339
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,200
Who eats a carrot at a picnic?

340
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,580
I mean, it doesn't seem so bad.

341
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh my gosh.

342
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,220
The widest turn radius ever.

343
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,500
What's that sound?

344
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,200
Oh.

345
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,990
Hello.

346
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,010
He's staring at me and I'm staring at him.

347
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,820
Oh my god, he saw me.

348
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,990
He sees me.

349
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,890
He sees me.

350
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:34,830
Hey!

351
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,250
This guy sucks.

352
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,530
Well, you know, we'll be perfect for our picnic.

353
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,310
Come on, please.

354
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:44,790
Let me play.

355
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,530
Oh.

356
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,030
No!

357
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,700
Did I break it?

358
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,480
Ah!

359
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,020
Uh-oh.

360
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,280
The music is so scary.

361
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,160
Oh, my God.

362
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:25,840
Go!

363
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
It's like a dinosaur!

364
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,700
It's chasing me.

365
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,360
Well, it doesn't work anymore, so I should be able to take
it now.

366
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:40,890
Sorry.

367
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,930
He's yelling at me.

368
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,190
Dang it!

369
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,390
I didn't mean to grab it again.

370
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,110
I wanted to grab his keys.

371
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,190
You failed goose.

372
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,350
What was that sound?

373
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,090
How does it still work?

374
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,230
I don't know, actually.

375
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,450
What is that?

376
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,150
Wait, what's that?

377
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,870
Curious.

378
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:28,970
Hmm.

379
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,850
What else do we need?

380
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,210
His keys, his sun hat, jam.

381
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,070
Oh, there's jam up here.

382
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,570
And the thermos.

383
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,590
I'm just looking.

384
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,790
I'm just intently staring.

385
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,360
I'm just...

386
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,130
How did he do this?

387
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:04,430
Fine!

388
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,460
You can have it!

389
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,570
You bastard, you... you...

390
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,610
When I get my beak on you, I swear.

391
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,020
I think the radio will have to be the last thing that we
grabbed for the picnic.

392
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,460
Oh.

393
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,780
Oh, I should have grabbed his keys just then.

394
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,240
Would have been perfect.

395
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,600
He's distracted.

396
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:28,800
Dang it!

397
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,360
Oh, I grabbed it!

398
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,200
I did the wrong...

399
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,660
Ah!

400
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,780
I got his keys!

401
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,250
I will never find them over here.

402
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,150
Okay.

403
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,440
Wait.

404
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,000
Is he looking for the rake?

405
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,220
You are so late, buddy.

406
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,920
Time for jam.

407
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,560
Time for jam.

408
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,600
We're jamming.

409
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:25,890
Oh!

410
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,610
Close the gate, but then I can't get out.

411
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,850
I have to be able to bring everything over here.

412
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,710
Unless there's like a secret way?

413
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,970
Through the bushes?

414
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,470
No.

415
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,690
Unless I can...

416
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,220
Oh my god.

417
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,330
Yeah!

418
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,130
Yeah!

419
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,290
Oh.

420
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,130
Wait, maybe if I take this carrot.

421
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:16,950
Watch me take it.

422
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,910
Watch me.

423
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,890
Watch me take a carrot.

424
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,930
Look, look, look.

425
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:22,610
Yeah!

426
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,320
Lock the groundskeeper out of the garden.

427
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,080
Wait, was that... Oh my gosh!

428
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,660
It's a hidden objective!

429
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,200
For everybody who's especially evil.

430
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,660
What does he do now?

431
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,020
Wait.

432
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,010
Well, I know what I must do.

433
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,950
I must continue my picnic.

434
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,830
No, he's gonna steal!

435
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,050
What are you gonna do with it?

436
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,370
What are you gonna do with it, huh?

437
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,050
What are you gonna do with it?

438
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:14,990
Be honest.

439
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,820
Oh, wrong way.

440
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,020
Oh, I wrong way.

441
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,380
I went the wrong way.

442
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,680
I think he forgot.

443
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,820
Wait, how do I get to my other...

444
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,200
Oh, there we go.

445
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Oh, pumpkin thermos radio.

446
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,550
Awesome.

447
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,030
Okay, through here, my hidey hole.

448
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:54,510
Perfect.

449
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,450
Will a pumpkin fit through my hole?

450
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,970
Now is the true test.

451
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,580
Oh, but it's heavy.

452
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,440
No!

453
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,660
No!

454
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,570
Yeah, that's right.

455
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,170
Oh, he gave up.

456
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,490
He says, I don't have a job anymore, so.

457
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,820
I don't know why we're eating a pumpkin.

458
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,020
But I support it.

459
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,900
Okay, two more.

460
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,220
He says, yeah, he says, I'm no one now.

461
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,960
What's the point?

462
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,880
Is he trying to find a way to jump over?

463
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,560
Wait, what's over here?

464
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,020
anything?

465
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:14,780
beyond the sea Somewhere waiting for me I will haunt every
day and night And watching the world Oh, he's thinking of

466
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:26,000
that pumpkin Think of pumpkin I like this single one that's
growing Here, I'm gonna go give this to him.

467
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,940
Freak phantom can fit a pumpkin in the hole.

468
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,260
Oh, wait, I can't go through.

469
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,040
Wait.

470
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,280
Oh, a pumpkin can fit in the hole!

471
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,800
But a single tulip cannot!

472
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,620
Oh, this again.

473
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,700
He likes it.

474
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,560
That's my apology.

475
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,620
Wait, where'd the jam go?

476
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,240
Oh, I took the jam.

477
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:52,980
That's my bad.

478
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,280
Sorry.

479
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,760
Wait, get that thermos.

480
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,540
There we go.

481
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,200
How nice of it to give you a flower.

482
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Exactly.

483
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,280
I'm a very thoughtful goose.

484
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,520
Don't look at me.

485
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,220
Don't perceive me.

486
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,520
Sneak.

487
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,540
Snake.

488
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,580
Snake.

489
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,140
I'm like a snake in the water.

490
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,020
I'm like a snake in the water.

491
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,700
Sneaking around.

492
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,540
Oh, wrong way.

493
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,600
Turn around.

494
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,120
I think I'll ever find his keys

495
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,310
That one was pretty clean.

496
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,890
A liquid snake, if you will.

497
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,050
Where is he, anyway?

498
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,410
He's lost the will to live.

499
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,410
My bad.

500
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,420
Me, don't mean to honking so loudly and stealing so
stealthily.

501
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,740
What is your wisdom of the day?

502
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,460
It's better to live.

503
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,380
Oh, wait, I didn't put on his sun hat!

504
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:20,260
we didn't make the groundskeeper wear so okay we'll have to
do our picnic and then do that um it is better to have

505
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:26,300
honked than to never have honked at all happy holidays me
though happy holidays

506
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,870
easy this is like a great advertising for this little radio
here.

507
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,850
It's waterproof.

508
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,680
I knew what to do with this item.

509
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,020
Make the groundskeeper hammer his thumb.

510
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,960
We're trying to inflict violence on him.

511
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,600
Watching you on the big screen that my toddler watered
watered and waddled over.

512
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,980
When you heard your voice, I think my wife has been watching
you while I'm at work.

513
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,960
Hello, baby!

514
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,820
Hello, baby!

515
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,660
Hello baby.

516
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,240
Hello baby.

517
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,280
Baby.

518
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,840
Hello baby.

519
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,500
Boah.

520
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,440
Oh, I'm tiny.

521
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,380
Wait, what am I about?

522
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,560
Hello baby.

523
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,580
Hello baby.

524
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,620
Baby.

525
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,640
Baby, baby, baby.

526
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,740
That's what you are.

527
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,700
You are a baby.

528
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,660
Baby,

529
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,890
do you want to see a trick?

530
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,280
Meow, meow,

531
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:22,740
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,

532
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,380
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

533
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,720
Okay, I will take your...

534
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,380
I'll consider your super chat of your babysitting payment.

535
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,880
Covering my eyes and going, Where's the bingo?

536
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,380
Got your nose!

537
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,320
Priceless content.

538
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,000
Wait, can I open it too?

539
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,920
Or is it locked?

540
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:55,800
Oh, okay.

541
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,860
I gotta get the keys, maybe.

542
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,440
Or I can go inside and unlock it.

543
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,440
You need to hammer.

544
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,780
You need to get back to work, mister.

545
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,100
You're never gonna get paid.

546
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,100
What will your wife think?

547
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,240
What will your wife think?

548
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,020
How do I get inside?

549
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,540
There we go.

550
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,260
Just got home from work.

551
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,660
I'm much confused.

552
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,620
Hello!

553
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,880
Don't be confused.

554
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,700
It's just a baby.

555
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:26,760
Uh-oh.

556
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,140
Oh no, I think I need the keys.

557
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:32,940
Uh-oh.

558
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,160
Wait, maybe I just give him his keys back.

559
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,020
That's my Kamiyoshi.

560
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,400
YouTubers as children's entertainment.

561
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,020
I'm off to start an agency?

562
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,320
What would it be called?

563
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,000
What would it be called?

564
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:02,110
I'm trying to think of like a VTuber teletubbies kind of,
you know?

565
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:05,570
VTubbies.

566
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,050
Get your keys.

567
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,020
Says, I don't know what those are.

568
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,200
Oh, yeah, you do.

569
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,800
Hey, don't get mad at me!

570
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,240
He's like, I gotta go replant this flower.

571
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,760
Oh, he doesn't know what to do.

572
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,420
His order of operations are all over the place.

573
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,380
Ah, the flower!

574
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,420
The caboose scares me.

575
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,640
I don't have object permanence.

576
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,680
Tell V tubbies.

577
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,560
Oh, that's good!

578
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:44,980
That's good!

579
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,480
That's good!

580
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,720
Wait, please come here.

581
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,900
How do I get I get him to wear his hat.

582
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,470
How do I get him to wear his hat?

583
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,670
Can you grab the hat?

584
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,910
I'm trying to, but I can't reach it.

585
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,370
Oh, the hammer.

586
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,470
Is this what he's looking for?

587
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,620
The hammer in his little thought bubble looked different,
though.

588
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,710
I have to get the hat first.

589
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,930
Maybe I can...

590
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,740
But I can't jump!

591
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,870
I think they mean the one he's wearing.

592
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,810
I see.

593
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,970
Oh, that's what you mean.

594
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,390
So then he changes hats.

595
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,050
Got it.

596
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,750
Do you ever want a guest star on Sesame Street?

597
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,450
Yeah.

598
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,850
I would love to.

599
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,510
Oh, shoot.

600
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,350
Oh, I thought he was gonna bend over.

601
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,430
Maybe, uh, what can we do to make him bend over?

602
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,250
Uh, I think it'd be...

603
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,630
It's like...

604
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,670
You know the music in, like, Zelda?

605
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,210
Where, like, the...

606
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,210
The part...

607
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,550
Where it's, like, kind of frightening and, you know?

608
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,810
Oh, he doesn't!

609
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,130
Oh, he collects them.

610
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,690
Oh, then I'm actually helping you.

611
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,450
I'm assisting you.

612
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,150
Plant

613
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,730
it, plant it!

614
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,690
Will we ever hear your reasoning on Big Bird?

615
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,470
Probably not.

616
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,470
Not, yeah, when the Guardian, the Guardians, that music,
yeah.

617
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
What are you doing?

618
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,680
Mr. What are you doing?

619
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:30,820
Yep,

620
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,440
that works.

621
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,120
Let me just place this on this goose.

622
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,200
What's that?

623
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,380
No!

624
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,630
Hang in there.

625
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,470
Wait!

626
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,470
I gotta get his hat though, for real.

627
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,610
Was he changing boots?

628
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,610
No, he's just moving him around.

629
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,430
He doesn't know what to do.

630
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,910
I'm so confused.

631
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,430
Ah, sign won't stop goose because mint can't read.

632
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,710
Yeah!

633
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,330
I mean, what?

634
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:35,630
Yeah!

635
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,700
Alright, plant it, plant it!

636
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,520
I wanna, I don't think I have to do the last thing, though,
sun hat, but I want to try.

637
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,520
I don't think for all of them I will aim for...

638
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:56,940
Yeah!

639
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,900
I don't think I'll end for complete like total completion
obviously but

640
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,940
see you sucker see you sucker I

641
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:25,520
hope that's not his favorite hat imagine he's just like
that's the hat my great great great grandpappy gave me the

642
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,020
day he died and he said as long as you wear this lucky cap
no one will know you're bald

643
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,140
That would be so sad.

644
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,540
Hello.

645
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,680
Wise words.

646
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,260
And completion!

647
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,180
Complete the garden to-do list.

648
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,880
Let's go!

649
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Onwards and honk words.

650
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,780
Hey kid!

651
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,910
You're afraid of a little goose?

652
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,850
You're afraid of a little goose kid, huh?

653
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,530
What, you afraid I'm gonna nip your butt or something?

654
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,990
You're afraid of all the rows and rows of teeth in my mouth?

655
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,790
You're afraid of how scary my tongue is?

656
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,230
You're afraid of my long neck going up your ass?

657
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,250
Come here kid!

658
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,090
Come here!

659
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,480
What was that?

660
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,720
There's something to grab.

661
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,800
Is it the kid?

662
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,540
Oh, wait, I think I can undo his...

663
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,720
Hey, come here.

664
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,380
Oh, he's...

665
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,940
Wait, I can take his glasses now?

666
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,320
Trip the boy in the puddle!

667
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,420
Gasly!

668
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,580
I got an extra...

669
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,480
I got an extra achievement for being extra muted.

670
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,640
Break the broom!

671
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,000
Trap the boy in the phone booth!

672
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,260
Make the boy wear...

673
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,440
the wrong glasses make someone buy back their own stuff get
on tv go shopping holy cow

674
00:44:50,640 --> 00:45:00,220

675
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:07,160
what we got going on over here this is a pretty big area
though Mint was born for this game.

676
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,860
Sell the plane, that's what I intended on doing.

677
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,740
I wanted to put it in the basket.

678
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh, my bad.

679
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,750
Is she gonna go get it again?

680
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,210
No way.

681
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,210
Is that kid still blind?

682
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,890
Oh, TV.

683
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,370
Is this how I get on?

684
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,170
Let me go.

685
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,590
Let me in, let me in, please!

686
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,140
You can't see it without his glasses.

687
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,040
I gotta give him a wrong pair of glasses.

688
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,760
Where is he anyway?

689
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,320
Oh god!

690
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,520
I'm reading this message, you are fated to be reincarnated
as a goose.

691
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:02,600
Again.

692
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,920
Is there any glasses in here?

693
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
A pair of glasses.

694
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,400
Did she hit me?

695
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,560
Oh, she just kind of sweeps me away.

696
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,800
Um, I don't see another pair of glasses.

697
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,120
Okay, hold on.

698
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,140
What else do we got to do?

699
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:30,960
Make the boy.

700
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,400
Uh, trap the boy in the phone booth.

701
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,960
I don't even see a phone booth.

702
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,940
Am I blind?

703
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:43,990
In the store.

704
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,730
She had a glasses stand.

705
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,170
She did?

706
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,190
Oh, I am blind.

707
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:49,570
Where?

708
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:50,690
Where?

709
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,710
I'm perusing.

710
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,230
I'm just stealing this leak.

711
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,670
Oh I see the glasses down, I see them now.

712
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,190
Hey kid, try these on for size.

713
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,290
Do they work?

714
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,390
Well, I guess I do.

715
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,120
You know the...

716
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,800
Oh, drill.

717
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,060
Today I learned my Oshi's actually a goose.

718
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,380
Why is he chasing after me now?

719
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,600
Oh, my handle was taken.

720
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,460
Happy birthday!

00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,520
Make the kid use the toothbrush.

744
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,680
We just hate him.

745
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,340
We're bullying him for no reason.

746
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,220
Broom to

747
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,760
if I were trying to break a broom.

748
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,720
I'm like, do I snap it in half?

749
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,060
But how would I do oh, I see the phone booth.

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,200
Hey kid, hey kid.

Hey kid.

00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,680
Oh, how could I get him in here?

753
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,140
How could I even open it myself?

754
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,520
I was thinking maybe...

755
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,360
Take it!

756
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,520
Oh, no!

757
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,160
Please!

758
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,580
Please, please, please!

00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,360
Let me in!

760
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,760
Scared him in there?

761
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,560
Oh, we could.

762
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,320
That's true.

763
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,000
Alright, let's scare...

764
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,860
Hey, no, not that way.

765
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,190
Oh, shoot.

766
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,230
Your broom is gone, lady.

767
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:53,370
Okay, wait.

768
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,130
Alright, come on.

769
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:56,710
Upwards?

770
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

771
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,990
Oh, shoot.

772
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,110
No, please.

773
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,890
Are they like, come help me?

774
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,330
Yes.

775
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:33,550
Yes.

776
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,630
I forgot how dynamic this game's soundtrack is.

777
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:39,350
I know, right?

778
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,490
How do I get on TV, though?

779
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:42,730
No!

780
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:43,690
Please, no!

781
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,090
I'm trying to get on TV!

782
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:45,530
What?

783
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:45,990
What?

784
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:46,770
I saw it!

785
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,310
I could press it!

786
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,430
No, why would I let me press it before?

787
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,210
I was trying to get the button, you guys.

788
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,070
I really was.

789
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,230
Wait, I'm stuck in the...

790
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,730
Oh, nice.

791
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:55,610
Okay, awesome.

792
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:56,150
Wait.

793
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,310
No, please.

794
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,010
There we go!

795
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,190
Oh, it just...

796
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,290
Oh my gosh, just barely.

797
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:08,650
Holy cow!

798
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,530
We did it?

799
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,030
Make someone buy back their own stuff.

800
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,530
Oh, put in the basket.

801
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:17,990
Toothbrush.

802
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,550
Ah!

803
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:19,810
Okay, here we go.

804
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,790
That's why we need the toothbrush in the basket.

805
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:23,430
Okay.

806
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,770
What else was it?

807
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:25,590
Trimmed...

808
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,930
Oh, tinned food, cleaner, fruit.

809
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:28,370
Okay.

810
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,670
We'll just go find all this stuff.

811
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,070
Yeah, it was absolute clutch.

812
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,590
Oh, we gotta break this.

813
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:35,870
Okay.

814
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,390
No, no.

815
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:41,410
Please let me grab it.

816
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,130
Please, let me...

817
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,230
Let me grab it.

818
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,230
Let me grab it.

819
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,110
Let me grab it.

820
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,150
Let me grab it.

821
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,830
Let me grab it.

822
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,550
Oh, grab it, grab it.

823
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:54,810
Grab it.

824
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,210
Grab it.

825
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:56,090
Grab it.

826
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:56,370
Grab it.

827
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:56,790
Grab it.

828
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:56,790
Grab it.

829
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,150
Grab it.

830
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,710
Grab it.

831
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,190
Grab it.

832
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:58,690
Grab it.

833
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:00,530
Yeah!

834
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,550
Yeah, give me...

835
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,730
Excuse me, man.

836
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,190
I have my oral hygiene to take care of.

837
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,370
Let's go, let's go.

838
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,210
She can't keep getting away with it.

839
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,790
Oh, my depth perception strikes again.

840
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,650
Yeah, we broke it.

841
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:32,890
Yeah, we broke it.

842
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,310
All right, next, loo paper.

843
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,490
Do you need to use the loo?

844
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,310
Let's grab the cleaner first while she's...

845
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:52,690
We'll let her be a little distracted.

846
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,050
I remember the cleaner over here and stuff.

847
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,430
Oh, not you.

848
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,130
I'm guessing this is the cleaner?

849
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,330
Toodle there!

850
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,710
Wait, this is not yours, is it?

851
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:09,630
Wait, is this yours?

852
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,090
It's not yours, is it?

853
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:21,900
Oh!

854
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:22,660
Oh!

855
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,240
Oh!

856
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,400
Oh!

857
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,300
I thought you were gonna go the other way!

858
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,200
I'm gonna goose brush the teeth on its tongue.

859
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:34,920
Potentially.

860
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,600
Alright, let's get the cleaner.

861
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,080
Hey, kid, move out of the way.

862
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,860
I know I gotta do something with your dang...

863
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,760
Oh my gosh, I missed the opportunity again.

864
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,820
I gotta do something with this dang plane, or soccer ball
maybe.

865
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,320
Hey!

866
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,360
You stupid kid.

867
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:56,710
Okay.

868
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:58,190
That should be in there?

869
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,350
Yes, cleaner.

870
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,570
Do you want a hint for the plane?

871
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,570
No, it's okay.

872
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,010
I'll figure it out.

873
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,450
I don't think it's the basket.

874
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,950
I think maybe since there's...

875
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,930
See the toys right there?

876
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,370
There's like one spot open?

877
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,150
I think that might be our clue.

878
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:13,950
Hey!

879
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,430
I know you're afraid of me.

880
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,070
Don't even try, kid.

881
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,330
Don't even try.

882
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:19,970
I'll mess you up.

883
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,450
I'll mess you up.

884
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:22,610
Ah!

885
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,790
She'll mess me up!

886
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,310
She'll mess me up!

887
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,140
What else was there?

888
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,460
Uh, loo paper.

889
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,380
We can maybe grab that now.

890
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,180
Sneaky, sneak, sneak.

891
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,680
Sneaking?

892
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,200
Oh my gosh, she gonna see me?

893
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,730
Does that count?

894
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:55,710
Did that?

895
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,050
She took the cleaner!

896
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,430
Oh, I'm gonna kill this lady.

897
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,120
No!

898
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,140
No!

899
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,660
Yeah, I think we do need to move the basket.

900
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,320
Otherwise, we're in trouble.

901
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,680
I didn't realize she would take things out.

902
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,960
Yeah, let's put the basket by the car first.

903
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,240
Best ghost?

904
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,320
Gim.

905
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:35,220
Natural.

906
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,000
Goose.

907
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:36,860
Goose.

908
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:37,620
Me too.

909
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,540
We'll make everything soggy.

910
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,640
She won't want it anymore.

911
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,340
Okay, cool.

912
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,280
I'm just trying to be a responsible citizen.

913
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,480
And she will let me.

914
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:07,980
Wait, can I go under?

915
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,640
Oh, I can.

916
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,600
Awesome.

917
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,620
Oh!

918
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,420
How did she know?

919
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,140
How did she know?

920
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,450
Alright, let's go get the cleaner again.

921
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,440
Wait, where did she put it?

922
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,430
Also, is a...

923
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:36,930
Oh, what?

924
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,050
Fruit and veg.

925
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,550
Does this count as a fruit?

926
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,110
Or do I have to get a fresh fruit?

927
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:51,750
We shall see.

928
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:54,310
Oh, ha, me too.

929
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,790
Oh, ha, oh, ha, oh, ha.

930
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,290
That's surely she count, right?

931
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,280
Is mayonnaise a fruit?

932
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,420
Oh, she did put it up there, though.

933
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,720
She did put up the plane.

934
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:29,820
Okay, awesome.

935
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:32,940
Let's see.

936
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:58,530
Nice.

937
00:59:59,250 --> 00:59:59,690
Hairbrush.

938
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,770
I don't know if I saw that.

939
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,010
Go buy your plane, kid.

940
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,310
Go buy it.

941
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,090
Hairbrush.

942
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:13,830
Oh, I see the hairbrush.

943
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:22,630
Dang it!

944
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,010
I pressed the wrong button!

945
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:30,850
It's fine.

946
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,210
It's fine.

947
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:33,550
We're fine.

948
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,360
Sometimes I like to just...

949
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,160
I gotta honk it out.

950
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,400
Worst possible time to honk.

951
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,680
Go buy your plane, kid.

952
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,580
Don't you miss it.

953
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,600
Maybe I gotta hide his soccer ball so he gets bored.

954
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,440
You know?

955
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,600
Oh.

956
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,180
Oh.

957
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,320
I can't.

958
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:58,920
I can't.

959
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,540
Wait, I wonder if I can...

960
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,150
No, no, no.

961
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:10,390
Hell yeah.

962
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,900
Dang it, okay.

963
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,520
Minto is extra cute today!

964
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,440
Here's some kawaii talks!

965
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,880
Alligato!

966
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,340
All right, what else we got?

967
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,380
Tinned food!

968
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,520
Tinned food.

969
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,600
Tinned food.

970
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,920
Oh, here we go.

971
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:55,880
All right.

972
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,160
Our shopping is almost complete.

973
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,380
Some honkingly isom taunting.

974
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,140
Yes.

975
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,640
She never knew what hit her, honestly.

976
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:09,400
Yes!

977
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:10,940
Cleaner!

978
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,420
What did she do with the cleaner?

979
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,420
First of all, that was not hers.

980
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,160
She actually did steal that.

981
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,000
And it's quite rude.

982
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:22,990
What'd she do with it?

983
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:38,110
vegetable a leak is a veggie right we're going the long way
you saw it on the shelf okay okay good eyes good eyes

984
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:56,300
yes fruit and veg oh the dead apple count nice okay the
cleaner is all we gotta get I thought Minto was gonna haunt

985
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,860
me not honk at me.

986
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,220
I can do both.

987
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,760
Hey, he took his...

988
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,620
You wanna play?

989
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,620
You wanna play a game?

990
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,160
Do something!

991
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,440
We call it honking.

992
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:33,090
I love how whimsical yet sinister this game.

993
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,230
It's pretty sinister.

994
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:38,070
Make someone buy back their own stuff.

995
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:38,710
When is he gonna buy?

996
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,250
I saw it.

997
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:41,830
Hey!

998
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,400
I wanna watch.

999
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,060
Lure the boy into the store.

1000
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,140
Is that what we gotta do?

1001
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,100
I thought he would just think about his plane and be like,
Where is it?

1002
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,520
Where could my plane be?

1003
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,050
Sneak.

1004
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,390
I like he's no snitch though.

1005
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:16,750
You know what?

1006
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,430
Maybe we've been too hard on him.

1007
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,430
He hasn't snitched on me even once.

1008
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:22,810
Yippee!

1009
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,590
Did he get a new to-do list item?

1010
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,270
Trap the shopkeeper in the garage.

1011
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,130
There's a garage?

1012
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:34,810
Run, kid, run!

1013
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,270
Run to the shop!

1014
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:37,530
No, not that way.

1015
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,910
No, wrong way.

1016
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,110
Run to the shop.

1017
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,410
Run near.

1018
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,410
There you go.

1019
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:51,750
Oh!

1020
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:52,650
Oh!

1021
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:53,270
Oh!

1022
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:53,730
Oh!

1023
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,430
Oh!

1024
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,620
Touching, baby.

1025
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,160
This is money laundering, maybe.

1026
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,320
Happy 4th of Hanukkah Minato.

1027
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,920
Here's some guilt for my favorite ghost.

1028
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:09,840
Thank you!

1029
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,100
Happy 4th night!

1030
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,600
Untitled ghost.

1031
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:18,880
Ow.

1032
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,440
Okay, where's the garage now?

1033
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,980
Why did he let her know?

1034
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:25,560
Oh!

1035
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,900
That doesn't look anything like me.

1036
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,400
You forgot my tail!

1037
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,980
Trapper in here, huh?

1038
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:38,600
Wait.

1039
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,040
I think I messed up.

1040
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,160
No, I think I messed right.

1041
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,240
Wait, lady!

1042
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,120
I can see it.

1043
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,040
We wake up unable to move at the middle of the night.

1044
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,020
The ghost made sounds at the foot of our bed staring.

1045
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,140
Time passes and she opens her mouth wide.

1046
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,000
I think I gotta let her know that I'm stealing.

1047
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,000
Hey!

1048
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:13,790
I'm stealing!

1049
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:17,690
I'm st- Oh!

1050
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,310
Wait, turn around.

1051
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:23,930
Oh,

1052
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:29,320
wait.

1053
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,440
Oh, I thought I needed to really kill her.

1054
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,720
I thought we were like, gonna trap her in there for real.

1055
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,540
It's a free goose world, lady.

1056
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,840
Was there something else that we didn't do?

1057
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:58,160
No?

1058
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:58,960
Okay, just kidding.

1059
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:03,100
I got an achievement, but I guess it's just for completing
this area.

1060
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:04,640
Nice!

1061
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,600
A fine tomb.

1062
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,020
This game is co-op.

1063
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:35,620
It does!

1064
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,680
It does, actually.

1065
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,740
I can't say really I have the honkers for it, but I have the
spirit.

1066
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,120
This?

1067
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,820
Why do these people hate the goose so much?

1068
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,160
Honk if you love maids!

1069
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:50,120
Oh.

1070
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,850
Is this a pathway that leads to nothing?

1071
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,590
What do we have going on here?

1072
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:05,630
Make someone break the fancy face.

1073
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,530
Help the woman dress up the bust.

1074
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:10,610
Make the man spit out his tea.

1075
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,310
Get dressed up with a ribbon.

1076
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,970
Make the man go barefoot.

1077
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,150
Do the washing.

1078
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:16,370
Oh bra!

1079
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,110
Just the mint experience when you go...

1080
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,690
It does look like a yaoi pet.

1081
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,770
We need them to be thirsty.

1082
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,730
What's wrong with being... Why do these people hate nature,
huh?

1083
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,530
Is that the ribbon I want?

1084
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,010
Oh, nope.

1085
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:40,690
It's the ribbon that lets me inside though.

1086
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,090
Oh, I want this!

1087
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,470
Can you please put this on me?

1088
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,890
Oh, she made me drop it.

1089
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:57,690
How do I put it on?

1090
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:03,190
Oh, I think maybe...

1091
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,570
Okay, I think I know what to do.

1092
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,870
I think I gotta move this guy.

1093
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,550
She has no clue.

1094
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,550
She has no idea.

1095
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,470
And then I stand there.

1096
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:22,250
Looking like a good goose.

1097
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:25,190
So...

1098
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,710
Wait, I'm the good goose.

1099
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:33,950
No, no, no!

1100
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,010
Please, it's me!

1101
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:41,370
Will she notice, you think?

1102
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,400
She just chucked it.

1103
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,760
She was like, that goose is no...

1104
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,000
Oh!

1105
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,260
She really hates me!

1106
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,760
It's okay for a lady with a goose in her yard.

1107
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,960
You must really, really hate us.

1108
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,840
You abuse that thing?

1109
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,350
My god.

1110
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:16,410
So rude.

1111
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,280
She's chasing after me again.

1112
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,880
I'm trying to...

1113
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,200
Go back to your painting.

1114
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,840
Is that the expensive vase right there?

1115
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:39,680
Ugly.

1116
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,300
I think it deserves to be broken.

1117
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,480
Stop staring at me.

1118
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,500
Oh, no, it's stuck.

1119
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:52,960
Oh, it's stuck.

1120
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,060
Oh, there we go.

1121
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,260
Dang it!

1122
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,860
The goose in your yard is probably taxidermy.

1123
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,520
Oh, my God.

1124
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,000
It's her own prize.

1125
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,260
Terrifying.

1126
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,200
Probably that frog, too.

1127
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,160
Here, that fish!

1128
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,880
Oh my god, oh my god.

1129
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:25,860
Terrifying.

1130
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,000
Yeah, get back to painting, lady.

1131
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:45,830
We gotta really hide it, Will.

1132
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,230
Alright, now take...

1133
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,470
Take that part.

1134
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:57,970
Yeah.

1135
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,950
Okay, we're gonna sneak.

1136
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:03,790
Oh!

1137
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,760
She's gonna notice.

1138
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:12,780
No, please!

1139
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:13,780
Please, ma'am!

1140
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:14,660
I'm your duck!

1141
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:15,940
I'm your goose!

1142
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,980
She says, you're still living!

1143
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,100
Oh, that's cute.

1144
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,180
Maybe if we, like, put it over here.

1145
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:28,620
And then run back.

1146
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:30,860
Oh my god!

1147
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:31,800
My bad.

1148
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:34,800
Okay, here we go.

1149
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,200
Here we go.

1150
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,460
Now she'll never know.

1151
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,400
She'll never know.

1152
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,400
Stop moving.

1153
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,560
Stop moving.

1154
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:40,560
Here we go.

1155
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,120
Here we go.

1156
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:46,900
What?

1157
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,960
I wasn't moving for some reason he was.

1158
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,940
I think he was getting impatient.

1159
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,240
Okay, here we go.

1160
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,340
This should be good.

1161
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,020
Where is she going?

1162
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:03,780
I'm so stressed.

1163
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,660
This game is stressing me out a little bit.

1164
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:16,430
Yippee!

1165
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:19,730
Yippee!

1166
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:23,190
Oh yeah.

1167
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:26,890
Alright, what else do we have to do?

1168
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,850
Make the man go barefoot.

1169
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:31,870
Make the man's bed obviously.

1170
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,610
Help the woman dress up the bus.

1171
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:36,910
What's he doing?

1172
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:42,610
Actually, how do I get back over to that side?

1173
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,230
What's this?

1174
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,620
Oh, it's really awful.

1175
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,820
I'm so awful.

1176
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,380
I thought she was gonna trip with the scissors.

1177
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,600
Dress up the bust.

1178
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:14,040
Okay, so we gotta find things to put on the bust that are
very cute, I think.

1179
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,620
Need topside to go back.

1180
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:22,520
Top side?

1181
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,080
What do you mean by that?

1182
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,040
Oh my god!

1183
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,780
That scared me

1184
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,520
Getting soapy How do we dress up the butt?

1185
01:14:49,740 --> 01:15:02,440
Oh, maybe oh wait the laundry where is okay, I think uh I
got the bra, I got the bra Oops, oh no Oh no!

1186
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,000
She's noticed the bra is gone!

1187
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,080
I'm not a pervert, I promise!

1188
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,380
Just a little bit.

1189
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:08,960
Alright.

1190
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,240
What's this here?

1191
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,080
Where is the washing machine anyway?

1192
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:23,660
Ha ha ha!

1193
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:26,120
A ding!

1194
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,400
Where is it anyway?

1195
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:33,920
Meep!

1196
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:43,720
Sneaky?

1197
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,160
She didn't find it, right?

1198
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,680
She didn't find it.

1199
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,980
How do I do the laundry?

1200
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,790
I might be making this more difficult on myself by putting
them in a place that I...

1201
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,130
Oh!

1202
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:05,190
Oh!

1203
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,570
You guys need to take care of that.

1204
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:10,930
That's, like, so dangerous.

1205
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:11,590
Sorry, my bad.

1206
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:12,450
I'm leaving!

1207
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:18,470
Hello, sir.

1208
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:19,050
Hey!

1209
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,090
What about my ribbon?

1210
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,010
You like it?

1211
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,750
It's very dashing on me.

1212
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:23,310
Is it not?

1213
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,050
Yeah.

1214
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,120
Uh, how do I give him some more soup?

1215
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,980
Oh, I wonder if I put the laundry in here.

1216
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,020
Maybe.

1217
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,600
Okay, let's bring the laundry here.

1218
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,580
Do I need the soap for it?

1219
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,500
Oh, that's a great question.

1220
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,820
Oh, I think I need to go around the other way, my bad.

1221
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,560
Dashed and goose I've ever seen ever.

1222
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,380
Yes, so lovely.

1223
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,300
Are these people neighbors?

1224
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,040
Are they like...

1225
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,360
Oh, she...

1226
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:10,820
Uh-oh.

1227
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,520
Wait, what was it?

1228
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:16,020
Make someone break the fancy vase.

1229
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,840
She found the bra.

1230
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,500
Or at least she found...

1231
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,060
Oh, pair of socks.

1232
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:28,280
Okay.

1233
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,580
Oh, it does say bar of soap.

1234
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:29,800
Okay.

1235
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:32,880
We gotta hurry.

1236
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:35,980
No!

1237
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,200
She'll never get it.

1238
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,380
Now we need the soap.

1239
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,040
Okay, nice.

1240
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,900
But she found the bra.

1241
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,260
I just don't know where she put it.

1242
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,620
I mean, maybe she didn't find the bra.

1243
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,460
She found the sock, at least.

1244
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,680
She'll never get it.

1245
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:04,460
You'll never have it again.

1246
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:04,940
Okay.

1247
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,160
Alright.

1248
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,560
Yes, this is mine.

1249
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,480
Yes, I am that size.

1250
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:17,020
This is a nice...

1251
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,460
Or a nice pair of honkers.

1252
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,600
Don't mind the goose with the bro.

1253
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,460
Okay.

1254
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,980
Are you gonna give that to him?

1255
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,280
What is he gonna do with it, huh?

1256
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:59,080

01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,280
Torture the hell out of this man.

1260
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,260
Oh, okay.

1261
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,360
I think I know what we need to do now.

1262
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:39,680
Excuse me.

1263
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,520
Oh, no, no, please, lady, please.

1264
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,140
Please.

1265
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,820
He's sipping the tea finally.

1266
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:45,560
Oh, good.

1267
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,500
I glitched through because I'm a genius.

1268
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,420
I'm a ghost duck.

1269
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,180
No!

1270
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,360
Go back to your tea!

1271
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:59,140
Honk with things in your beak for fun sound stuff.

1272
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,280
Oh yeah, yeah, they're cute.

1273
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,060
Speedrun strats.

1274
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,660
Please go back to drinking your tea.

1275
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,820
In fact, I'll take a sip.

1276
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,040
I'll show you how it's done.

1277
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,920
Sound warning, I'll turn it down a little bit.

1278
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:26,020
And a one and a two and a...

1279
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:27,900
Ah,

1280
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,360
why does she have that anyway?

1281
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,320
Help the woman dress up the bust.

1282
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,520
Make someone break the fancy vows.

1283
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,060
Got some pretty awful news from work.

1284
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,040
No, I'm so sorry.

1285
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:50,120
Pray for me to get a better job somewhere soon.

1286
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,040
I hope so.

1287
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,800
I hope you can get a better job soon sometime.

1288
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:55,880
Oops.

1289
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,940
How do I break the vase?

1290
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:00,800
The vase.

1291
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:01,860
And this guy.

1292
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,900

01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,880

01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,400
No one taught me how to do laundry.

01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,340

Go back to your newspaper.

1310
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:38,020
Wow, what a nice pipe you have there, mister.

1311
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,400
I'll look away.

1312
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:00,690
No, please!

1313
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:02,610
Please!

1314
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:03,350
Please!

1315
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:04,190
Please!

1316
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:04,950
Please!

1317
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:06,430
Oh, oh!

1318
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,000
I can grab it.

1319
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,720
Good, she's oblivious.

1320
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:24,980
Good, she's oblivious.

1321
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,390
Oh, yeah, I wanted to honk with it.

1322
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:29,720
Oh.

1323
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:35,220
I thought little bubbles would come out.

1324
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,720
I'm a little disappointed.

1325
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:38,060
That's okay.

1326
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,280
That's fine.

1327
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,460
What a distinguished goose!

1328
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:50,770
Oh my god.

1329
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,660
Please, sir.

1330
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,220
Please, you don't understand.

1331
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,360
If I don't do these things, they'll get me.

1332
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,640
They're out for me.

1333
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,380
Bubbles with the soap, yeah.

1334
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,640
Oh, if I eat the soap.

1335
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,780
You don't care about the soap.

1336
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:15,740
This isn't yours.

1337
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,020
Why is he being... Oh, that's yours.

1338
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:18,300
Yeah.

1339
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:19,240
I did take that.

1340
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,500
Oh, shoot, please.

1341
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,560
We're gonna hide?

1342
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,460
You'll never know.

1343
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,140
As long as you don't drop it.

1344
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:35,880
Yeah.

1345
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,240
It'll get dirty.

1346
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,960
He has no idea.

1347
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:00,300
Shoot.

1348
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,280
Take

1349
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:05,770
it.

1350
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:06,770
And then please.

1351
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:08,370
And then please.

1352
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,170
Grab it.

1353
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:11,690
Oh.

1354
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:12,750
I had it.

1355
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:13,850
Yes.

1356
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,250
I'm too good.

1357
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:16,430
I'm too good.

1358
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:17,610
Who needs stealth?

1359
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,250
Stealth is optional.

1360
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:21,770
Stealth is optional.

1361
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:50,310
Get it.

1362
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,190
Get it.

1363
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:52,230
And then get it.

1364
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:53,670
Yeah!

1365
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:58,770
Oh,

1366
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:04,430
so cute.

1367
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,290
Wait, I want to see her dress him up.

1368
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,570
She's like, wow, so perfect.

1369
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,090
Very lovely.

1370
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:23,610
Love how she's giving back her stuff and she's using his
stuff to decorate.

1371
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:25,690
Make sure.

1372
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:30,370
We gotta make him go barefoot, and we gotta break the vase.

1373
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,950
I don't think he's giving her stuff back.

1374
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:33,390
Is he?

1375
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,150
Oh, he is.

1376
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,290
He gave back the vase.

1377
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:45,870
Mr. Mr. Mr.

1378
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,950
You took, you gave her back the most important thing.

1379
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:55,170
How do I, how do I, wait.

1380
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,450
Oh, whoops.

1381
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:01,130
Wait.

1382
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,770
How do I make her break it, though?

1383
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,550
Oh, she's probably got to hold it.

1384
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:11,590
And then I honk.

1385
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:13,350
And spook her.

1386
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:14,890
No?

1387
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:18,170
Maybe I ring the bell, then.

1388
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,630
Okay, I think that's what I do.

1389
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:21,950
Come here.

1390
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:22,850
Come here.

1391
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:23,130
Come here.

1392
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:24,830
Come here.

1393
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:28,550
What is this?

1394
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:33,870
What is this?

1395
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:37,250
She just needs to add the bra and the bus.

1396
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,660
Wait, I forgot the plan.

1397
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,440
What was I going to do?

1398
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,100
Wait, what is it anyway?

1399
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,680
Make someone break it.

1400
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:55,520
What if he...

1401
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,280
Wait, uh...

1402
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,620
Do I have to be super fast here?

1403
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,400
Okay.

1404
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,320
Maybe then I use...

1405
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,720
Maybe I can make him do it.

1406
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:12,010
Let's go, go, go.

1407
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:12,770
Ow!

1408
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,530
I didn't even need it!

1409
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:17,870
Oh my gosh!

1410
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:19,430
I...

1411
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,450
Why would you do that?

1412
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:26,510
Make someone prune the prize rose.

1413
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,660
I guess... Oh!

1414
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:36,900
He drew also.

1415
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,720
He drew the best goose so far.

1416
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:41,800
What a jerk.

1417
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:42,480
I know.

1418
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,760
I think they hate each other, these neighbors.

1419
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,420
What a lovely...

1420
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,420
Oh, I see what I have to do.

1421
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,720
I see what I have to do.

1422
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:01,800
Are they arguing?

1423
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,400
The girls are fighting?

1424
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,600
Perfect opportunity for me.

1425
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,340
Oh no, yeah.

1426
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,120
Your bush, whatever will you do?

1427
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:29,960
Oh.

1428
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:33,720
Wait, did she do it?

1429
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,030
Oh, she's doing it.

1430
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,040
Oh, my bad.

1431
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,340
No, more, more, more, more, more, more.

1432
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,260
More, more, more, more, more, more.

1433
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,400
An eye for an eye.

1434
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,320
That's what I say.

1435
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,600
An eye for an eye.

1436
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:06,660
My vase.

1437
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,020
Your.

1438
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,340
What was the last one?

1439
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,640
Make the man go barefoot.

1440
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,260
It's okay.

1441
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,480
I think I'll just continue onwards.

1442
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,820
I do have a meeting tonight.

1443
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:19,240
I have so many meetings.

1444
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:19,980
I'm sorry, guys.

1445
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,760
It's okay if we don't 100%.

1446
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:29,360
Okay.

1447
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,180
Hi!

1448
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,460
You'll never see me again for now.

1449
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:38,840
Oh!

1450
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,220
So many meetings.

1451
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,600
No, it's just that Densetsu we have.

1452
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:53,100
So basically, we have a weekly one-on-one meeting and a
weekly group meeting.

1453
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:59,240
And group meetings are on Wednesdays and my one-on-one is on
Sundays.

1454
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:03,740
But that never, I never like streamed at the time that I
have my group, my one-on-one meeting.

1455
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:05,740
Hmm.

1456
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:13,080
And then we had to meet- we and the, um, Phoebe and Vicky,
we had to meet up to discuss some stuff.

1457
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:18,180
Oh, oh, what did I do?

1458
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,260
So, yeah.

1459
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,380
That's- that's why- that's why it's like, oh my gosh,
there's always a meeting.

1460
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,660
It's just- it's just us, like, checking in.

1461
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,940
It's not always super important.

1462
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,060
It's good to be there, you know.

1463
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,320
Just in case I'm like...

1464
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,940
In case there's something that I need to do.

1465
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:52,180
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la.

1466
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,800
Spread my wings, what?

1467
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,320
Group meeting, gossip?

1468
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:57,820
Dish, wait.

1469
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,400
Oh, I know where I am.

1470
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:01,880
Dish girl.

1471
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:02,600
Okay.

1472
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,700
So the tea is...

1473
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,950
Oh, what is this?

1474
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:18,430
Oh, there's a key there.

1475
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:19,670
Or there's a lever there.

1476
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,610
Yeah?

1477
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:21,970
The T?

1478
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:25,330
Oh, baby.

1479
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:31,710
Wait, I want to try this one.

1480
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:33,090
Oh.

1481
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:35,210
Look how cute he is, though, is it?

1482
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:37,070
What does that do?

1483
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:40,770
Is this like a dam that will flood the whole city if I...

1484
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:43,530
Or...

1485
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:43,670
Or...

1486
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:46,090
Maybe it will stop the water.

1487
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:51,520
Let's go around.

1488
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:52,880
Where did I come from?

1489
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:54,100
Where did I go?

1490
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,220
Where did I come from?

1491
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,940
Cotton Eye Joe.

1492
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,540
Hello, sir.

1493
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,120
This guy doesn't look very friendly.

1494
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,460
I'm just saying that now.

1495
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,080
Oh, I knew it.

1496
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,620
Oh my god, I knew it.

1497
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,320
Immediately.

1498
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:15,700
Immediately ousted.

1499
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,960
What do you all have against the geese?

1500
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:27,180

1503
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:52,800
Hello.

1504
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,280
Hello.

1505
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:58,880
Just a box.

1506
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:00,900
Just a box.

1507
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,620
How would you know?

1508
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:16,810
Just a box.

1509
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,620
Not a peep.

1510
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:31,480
Not a peep.

1511
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,200
Not a peep.

1512
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:35,720
Does it weigh the sound?

1513
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,160
Is it the sound?

1514
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,440
The weight of a goose?

1515
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,800
This is approximately 1.5 goose.

1516
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,020
Now that'd be just rude.

1517
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:50,840
Where am I going?

1518
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,760
The slaughterhouse.

1519
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:56,340
Just a box.

1520
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,840
But she'll keep that door open, right?

1521
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:08,820
Dang it!

1522
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,710
Where am I now though?

1523
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:23,450
Get me out of here.

1524
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:26,110
I should have...

1525
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:32,890
Well, I think if I had honked, she would have thrown me out.

1526
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:45,740
What is this?

1527
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:48,840
Cleaner.

1528
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,140
Break the dartboard.

1529
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,320
Is there a dartboard?

1530
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:55,700
What does this say behind here?

1531
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:00,520
Like a sign there.

1532
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,960
Oh wait, I think I can get in through here.

1533
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,380
Wait, is there even more?

1534
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,160
No, okay.

1535
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:14,380
Oh!

1536
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:34,880
There's so many people out to get me.

1537
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,680
It's kind of terrifying, actually.

1538
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,360
It's scary how many people hate me now.

1539
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:42,640
Oh!

1540
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:46,250
How do I get it?

1541
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:47,510
How do I... how would I break?

1542
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:47,830
Okay.

1543
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,760
I gotta be awarded that flower!

1544
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:08,100
Oh, what?

1545
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,360
Yeah, there you go.

1546
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,580
Oh my god!

1547
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:18,460
Thank you!

1548
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,280
Thank you!

1549
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:20,200
Thank you!

1550
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,940
Thank you!

1551
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:28,080
That's so cute.

1552
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,740
Wait, that was the cutest thing ever!

1553
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:33,340
He's thinking cute.

1554
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,060
I'm a showbird.

1555
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,200
I'm a showbird.

1556
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,620
Look at me.

1557
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:41,620
Look at me.

1558
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:42,520
Look at me.

1559
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:43,440
Look at me.

1560
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:44,840
I'm a showbird.

1561
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,420
I'm the prettiest bird.

1562
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:04,740
Alright.

1563
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,580
Get the toy boat.

1564
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:08,080
Toy boat.

1565
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:08,900
Toy boat.

1566
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:09,280
Toy boat.

1567
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:09,700
Toy boat.

1568
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,100
Toy boat.

1569
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:10,500
Toy boat.

1570
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:22,360

dartboard by throwing it throwing a fork at it instead The

1573
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:49,420
goose has been irreversibly changed by the powers of idolu.

1574
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:52,420
Steal a pint glass and drop it in the canal.

1575
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,240
A pint glass?

1576
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,440
Is that in the restaurant?

1577
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,520
I'm not a dork, am I?

1578
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:04,880
Sneaky, quiet.

1579
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:05,920
Oh wait.

1580
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,260
Is that the lady?

1581
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:08,600
Who is cleaning?

1582
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:16,680
That's the pint glass, right?

1583
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,340
Oh wait, there's a knife too, maybe that'll break it.

1584
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:23,780
Run!

1585
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:24,560
Oh!

1586
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,880
It made me break it!

1587
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,930
Do I have to do my whole maneuver again to get inside?

1588
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:48,040
How do I get inside again?

1589
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:52,730
Oh, there we go.

1590
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,680
How do I drop it in the canal, though?

1591
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:05,240
Oh, dang it!

1592
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:20,340
I just needed to be a little bit patient oh I have no
patience please please please I'm stuck actually there we go

1593
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:26,310

1594
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:46,320
yes yes yes how do I get maybe I need to distract him
somehow.

1595
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,760
Fish and mailed.

1596
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:57,820
And there was also a toy boat.

1597
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:08,600
Your code name for this mission is Naked Goose.

1598
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:10,720
Ah,

1599
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:18,000
it's a goose.

1600
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,260
I want to see what else is back here real quick.

1601
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:30,080
That is definitely an anti-goose sign right there, though.

1602
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:49,080
behind there that is absolute let's see is there anything
can i drag this no was there anything over here no my first

01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:56,360
super thanks for spending time with us oh my gosh tj
autonomous thank you so much thank you

1604
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,220
Make the old man fall on his bum.

1605
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,680
Okay, I think let's try it.

1606
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,880
Let's try and break the dartboard.

1607
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,160
I think maybe, like I said, it's the knife.

1608
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,100
In the restaurant.

1609
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,400
Like, maybe we have him use the knife instead of the dart.

1610
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:17,660
And it breaks it, you know?

1611
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,480
It's just a box.

1612
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:21,360
Just a box.

1613
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:24,240
Just a box.

1614
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:26,380
No.

1615
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:27,800
No, no, no, no.

1616
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:28,540
No, no, no.

1617
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:31,440
You never saw me.

1618
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:50,850
Did I hear him on the harmonica?

1619
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:52,110
Oh yeah, I did!

1620
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:53,430
How cute!

1621
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:54,350
Okay.

1622
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:02,900
Maybe I can...

1623
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:03,200
Oh!

1624
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:03,520
Oh!

1625
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:05,420
Oh!

1626
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:10,810
No, the other one.

1627
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:12,290
No, please lady.

1628
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:13,650
Please, lady.

1629
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:15,050
You don't understand.

1630
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:15,850
Yeah, please, lady.

1631
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:16,230
Yeah, yeah, there we go.

1632
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:17,030
Okay, nice.

1633
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:19,490
Nah, well, thank you so much for the tour.

1634
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:20,090
You have to dance.

1635
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:20,610
Thank you!

1636
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:22,950
Thank you, thank you so much.

1637
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:23,490
Okay.

1638
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:32,220
No, not that, please.

1639
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,200
The knife.

1640
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:36,100
Maybe it's not the knife at all.

1641
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,000
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

1642
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:38,620
Oh.

1643
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,060
Or, um, maybe.

1644
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,720
That's the toy boat!

1645
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,980
No one ever notices the goose.

1646
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,500
What has he got?

1647
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:11,280

I don't care.

1653
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,440
Wait, it was here, no?

1654
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:55,880
Oh.

1655
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,060
Wait.

1656
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:03,960
I'm just taking it for the fun of it.

1657
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,440
For the love of the game.

1658
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:07,040
Hey!

1659
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,280
How do I...

1660
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,900
Maybe it's not.

1661
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,100
How you break it.

1662
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:18,640
I don't know.

1663
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:24,350
Oh!

1664
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:30,780
You're above!

1665
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:34,280
Wait, is this the old man that I need to knock over?

1666
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,780
That I need to make...

1667
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:37,100
Oh my gosh, wait.

1668
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,840
I think I know how.

1669
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,120
Wait, that's so bad.

1670
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,740
It's actually so bad though.

1671
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:47,500
He'll break his... his tailbone.

1672
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:52,900
So kind of funny though.

1673
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:55,840
Fill in the blank.

1674
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,860
Osla is to snake as blank as to goose.

1675
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:12,300
Get pranked.

1676
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:19,960
My mom would always be like, you cannot do that because she
knew somebody that that happened to and she broke her

1677
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:23,360
tailbone and so she was always just like never ever do that.

1678
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,580
That prank.

1679
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:27,660
She said never ever.

1680
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,040
I need that pint right there.

1681
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,500
Oops.

1682
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:37,620
Oopsie, oopsie, oopsie.

1683
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:52,310
Yes, yes.

1684
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:56,130
My parents said that about whipping people with towels.

1685
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:00,700
What?

1686
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,260
That would break their bones?

1687
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:11,010
Okay, awesome.

1688
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:12,610
Okay.

1689
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:14,650
Alright, we got the pint.

1690
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:18,870
Now what?

1691
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:21,570
How do I very...

1692
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:24,710
Do I hide in the box again?

1693
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:25,650
You think?

1694
01:47:28,570 --> 01:47:29,690
Well, I think she...

1695
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:30,810
Wait, no, she only carried...

1696
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:33,190
I don't think I've ever seen a carry-a-box out on the end.

1697
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:37,290
I don't want it to break, you know?

1698
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:40,630
What kind of towels are they using?

1699
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,460
Still a pint glass and drop it in the canal.

1700
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,980
Oh, I bet she also turned off the water, I just realized.

1701
01:47:54,980 --> 01:48:00,240
Let's uh, maybe I can distract him and then go under here.

1702
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:04,200
Oh my gosh, she scared me.

1703
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:05,820
You bitch!

1704
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:06,620
You bitch!

1705
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:07,420
You bitch!

1706
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:08,340
You bitch!

1707
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,800
You bitch!

1708
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:10,560
You bitch!

1709
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:11,720
No!

1710
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:14,120
No!

1711
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,480
It sucks when your tail breaks off.

1712
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,000
Then it takes forever to grow back.

1713
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:46,480
And it's never quite the same.

1714
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:47,740
Yeah, it gets really big.

1715
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:49,140
It's not skinny anymore.

1716
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:53,320
So then everybody knows that you broke your tail off.

1717
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:06,840
Get bolded.

1718
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,420
No, she said calmly.

1719
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:16,080
Oh, I think that was a valid crash out.

1720
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,440
All right.

1721
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,910
He's hard to get around, though.

1722
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:25,530
He's tricky.

1723
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:31,650
You can untie the guy's shoelaces.

1724
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:33,810
Thank you.

1725
01:49:35,650 --> 01:49:37,210
Oh, I'm getting shooed.

1726
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:39,830
Wait, what about when all the glasses are gone?

1727
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:42,830
What do I do then?

1728
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:46,630
Are there any left?

1729
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:53,990
Uh.

1730
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,820
I might just have to not do that.

1731
01:49:58,840 --> 01:49:59,460
that quest.

1732
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,340
Oh, there's one left.

1733
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:13,020
There is one left.

1734
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,920
Nice goosey crash out.

1735
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,480
Thank you.

1736
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,700
Don't do it!

1737
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:35,420
Please.

1738
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:39,640
Can I hide you?

1739
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,840
It will respawn, I think.

1740
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:44,280
It will.

1741
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:45,200
You think I don't think so.

1742
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:50,620
Yay!

1743
01:50:53,970 --> 01:50:55,750
Okay, well we at least got this one.

1744
01:50:58,710 --> 01:50:59,790
Why do you care about this boat?

1745
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:01,470
Why do you care about this boat?

1746
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:07,070
Break the dartboard and set the table.

1747
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:07,710
That's right.

1748
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:08,910
What table?

1749
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:12,590
Oh, it's probably this one, no?

1750
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:16,250
Knife, fork, plate, pepper, candle.

1751
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:18,230
Okay, okay, we can do that.

1752
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:25,370
Oh, there was a knife around here, huh?

1753
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:26,350
Yeah, I stole it.

1754
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:27,950
Where'd it go?

1755
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:30,830
Where did it go?

1756
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:43,500
Nice.

1757
01:51:48,810 --> 01:51:50,490
An eye for an eye.

1758
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:54,210
Okay.

1759
01:51:58,190 --> 01:51:59,690
Never punished, everybody.

1760
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:00,830
Monique!

1761
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:02,950
Thank you so much!

1762
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:05,950
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

1763
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:07,210
20 gifts, thank you.

1764
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:09,770
Oh my

1765
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:17,670
goodness.

1766
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:20,170
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1767
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:29,490
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1768
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:30,870
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1769
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:34,950
Can I get a hint for the dartboard?

1770
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,830
I think that's one that I would need a hint for.

1771
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:40,110
If I don't do the pint.

1772
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:42,710
Metal goose.

1773
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,530
Oh, and I've trained for this.

1774
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:49,370
It involves honking.

1775
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:50,070
Okay, cool.

1776
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:52,250
I will remember that.

1777
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:54,730
Plate.

1778
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:56,230
There was a plate.

1779
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:58,450
Uh-oh.

1780
01:52:58,550 --> 01:52:59,230
Are the girls fighting?

1781
01:52:59,330 --> 01:52:59,490
No.

1782
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:00,530
They're just having arms.

1783
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:01,890
That plate right there.

1784
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:02,510
Hello.

1785
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:04,570
They love me, though.

1786
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:06,170
They won't rat me out.

1787
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:08,630
They love me.

1788
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:09,270
They love me.

1789
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:10,450
All right.

1790
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:11,010
Our plate.

1791
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:14,210
Plate, gitto.

1792
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:15,990
Nice.

1793
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:16,850
Top it.

1794
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:18,710
You ruined my plans before.

1795
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:21,350
I won't have you ruined my plans again.

1796
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:24,850
Okay.

1797
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:29,590
Okay.

1798
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:30,190
Hint.

1799
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:31,090
Honk.

1800
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:32,730
I love that.

1801
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:33,350
That's a hint.

1802
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:36,410
Uh, candle.

1803
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:39,150
I thought those were ashtrays.

1804
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:40,950
Are those candles?

1805
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:43,590
They look like ashtrays to me, though.

1806
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:45,830
Am I...

1807
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:46,290
Am I...

1808
01:53:46,310 --> 01:54:05,700
silly is there a candle what the oh I thought I thought like
a cutscene what is happening please no I'm trying to see if

1809
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:10,660
I see a candle in there but I do not in an alternate
universe Minto played goose game before MGS or right now

1810
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:20,880
she's honking while choking out guards candle is in the
corner okay I must have not seen it I'm just gonna casually

1811
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,920
waddle up here.

1812
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,060
Where is she?

1813
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:30,450
Okay, wait, what do I...

1814
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:31,050
A fork!

1815
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:31,950
Oh, perfect.

1816
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:37,840
Okay.

1817
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:39,660
Wait, I'm not under the table.

1818
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:41,780
Okay, be nice.

1819
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,000
Nice.

1820
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:45,040
Nice.

1821
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:49,340
Wait.

1822
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:50,640
Okay.

1823
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:52,200
Yeah, that was good timing.

1824
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:52,560
Okay.

1825
01:54:56,100 --> 01:55:02,920
I feel like I'm setting up the spaghetti scene from Lady and
the Tramp.

1826
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,360
This is a knot.

1827
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:06,720
What's that?

1828
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,280
Oh, that's a toy boat that I stole.

1829
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:13,160
What a beautiful knot.

1830
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:16,120
Okay, candle must be the other corner.

1831
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,240
Trust.

1832
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,480
Can I pull that out?

1833
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:31,720
See that cork in the barrel?

1834
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:34,930
Can I get that?

1835
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:37,220
You?

1836
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:38,340
You!

1837
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:39,360
You!

1838
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,460
You may have.

1839
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,160
Wait.

1840
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:07,240
Gotta bring the goose statue to that spot.

1841
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:09,060
The goose statue?

1842
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:13,120
What goose statue?

1843
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:16,040
Oh, like...

1844
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,180
That lady?

1845
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,560
The one that had the...

1846
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:29,980
The...

1847
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,260
The garden?

1848
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,380
Yes, I got the candle.

1849
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:40,560
Oh my god.

1850
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,300
You're really ruining my plans right now.

1851
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:44,600
Thank you.

1852
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,300
Do not...

1853
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:52,740
Pay attention to the goose if the goose is not paying
attention to you.

1854
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:55,320
Yeah!

1855
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:56,780
Good enough.

1856
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,180
Good enough?

1857
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:05,900
Oh, this is a knight with a beautiful knight.

1858
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,240
All right, let's go break that dartboard.

1859
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:10,600
I give up on the pint.

1860
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:11,560
I tried two times.

1861
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:16,640
I know they say third times a charm, but I'm all the charm
that I need.

1862
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,870
No, stop playing harmonica.

1863
01:57:29,590 --> 01:57:30,330
Hey, Christmas.

1864
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:31,190
Happy Holidays!

1865
01:57:31,490 --> 01:57:32,470
Thank you, CJ!

1866
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:33,590
See, Jeff?

1867
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:35,230
It's my birthday!

1868
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:35,950
Happy birthday!

1869
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:38,330
Happy, happy birthday!

1870
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,500
Oh, that's it?

1871
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:01,700
He's just gotta have a little breather, and then he's done.

1872
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:03,040
You know?

1873
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:07,980
I'm looking away, I'm looking away.

1874
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:16,330
A one, and a two, and a...

1875
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:21,510
Wait,

1876
01:58:26,050 --> 01:58:26,790
what's that on there?

1877
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:27,970
No, let me have it.

1878
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:28,910
Let me have it.

1879
01:58:29,110 --> 01:58:29,610
Let me have it.

1880
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:32,690
It's mine.

1881
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:34,610
It's mine.

1882
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:34,770
No.

1883
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:35,610
It's mine.

1884
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:47,600
It's mine.

1885
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:53,680
What is it?

1886
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:56,620
Drop a bucket on the burly man's head.

1887
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:58,560
What?

1888
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:01,920
That's what I need to do to get out of here?

1889
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,920
Drop a bucket on this guy's head?

1890
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,220
Why is he a gatekeeping the park anyway, huh?

1891
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,000
How do I drop a bucket on his head?

1892
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,000
Birdly man.

1893
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,780
I thought I misread it.

1894
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:22,000
And that it actually did say birdly man.

1895
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:25,980
There was a bucket.

1896
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:26,660
Was there?

1897
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,780
Where are I?

1898
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,620
A bucket.

1899
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:35,320
In here?

1900
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:37,940
Oh wait?

1901
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:40,880
I see it!

1902
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:42,640
That... Oh!

1903
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,660
He's gotta get the...

1904
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:49,480
Do I chase him in here?

1905
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,820
She is doing it.

1906
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:02,700
I'll take that.

1907
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:06,580
I'll take that.

1908
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:13,750
Why do they have these signs?

1909
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:16,350
It's my other question.

1910
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:20,630
Why do these signs exist?

1911
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:36,810
For me?

1912
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:39,230
They love me that much.

1913
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:43,430
Okay.

1914
02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:46,130
Just like that, and it works.

1915
02:00:48,050 --> 02:00:48,350
But what?

1916
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:50,350
Do I get him over there?

1917
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:55,660
Oh!

1918
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:03,120
Don't you worry, you're a pretty little head.

1919
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:05,000
Wait, is she getting the candle?

1920
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:06,700
No heck in the way.

1921
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,060
She just...

1922
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:08,320
Oh, no.

1923
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:09,040
She's getting the bucket.

1924
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,720
Don't disrupt my dinner scene, please.

1925
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:18,000
She's really tall.

1926
02:01:21,830 --> 02:01:22,970
My dinner seat!

1927
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:28,190
I'm trying to get out of your way!

1928
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:30,870
Please, let a goose live.

1929
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:35,170
Alright.

1930
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:38,330
I'm gonna wait until there's less people over there.

1931
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:39,710
And then we'll hopefully...

1932
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:42,650
How do I get him to run over there, though?

1933
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:45,710
And then not chase me when I go to get the bucket, you know?

1934
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:57,490
the city why do they have these signs mess up the apples is
that what i do excuse you

1935
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:08,910

1937
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:42,000
Oh no, now there's two of them.

1938
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,140
Don't worry about the glass.

1939
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:45,440
You don't even work here.

1940
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,640
Don't worry about that.

1941
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:48,940
Don't worry about it.

1942
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:49,340
Seriously.

1943
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:52,180
Tompo.

1944
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:55,400
Don't worry about that.

1945
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:56,700
Don't worry about it.

1946
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:57,900
Don't worry about it.

1947
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:01,380
He's so concerned about everything, except the things that
matter.

1948
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:03,720
I'm surrounded, I am.

1949
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:05,160
Oh, there he goes.

1950
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:05,580
There he goes.

1951
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:06,520
Okay.

1952
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:08,120
Yeah.

1953
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:14,180
Yes, you're very, very concerned about the tomato.

1954
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:18,280
You're very, very concerned about the tomato.

1955
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:23,510
Am I gonna?

1956
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:27,760
I'm scared.

1957
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,840
I'm scared she'll see me over there, you know.

1958
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:35,520
You're very, very concerned.

1959
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,520
Ah, ah, oh.

1960
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,840
Does he got it yet?

1961
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:52,120
Mr. I don't like the way my mouth just kind of hangs open
like that.

1962
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:54,140
I mean, I am a goose.

1963
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:56,020
Maybe I'm actually catching flies.

1964
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:01,420
It's so quiet.

1965
02:04:09,330 --> 02:04:11,190
I wasn't in the...

1966
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:11,950
Wrong person.

1967
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:13,370
Where is he?

1968
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:27,670
Maybe he put it in the wrong thing.

1969
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:51,400
since there's more than one you know no he didn't where is
it it's gone oh shoot what'd you do with it what'd you do

1970
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:58,220
with her where is she where is she he aided it

1971
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:10,220
I don't blame him I eat whole tomatoes like that too Hey!

1972
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:14,140
Okay, let's do another one then.

1973
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:31,000
Leave a trail of them.

1974
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:32,020
I don't know if that's...

1975
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:33,140
Well, I guess I could try.

1976
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:34,580
Right?

1977
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,500
It's like...

1978
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:36,500
Run,

1979
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:44,220
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1980
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,220
Doki Bird is our...

1981
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:46,960
Wait, but I think someone else will grab it.

1982
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:49,360
I don't think we can use a...

1983
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:50,600
I don't think we can leave a trail.

1984
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:50,860
trail.

1985
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,520
I feel like someone else will grab one.

1986
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:53,600
Maybe not.

1987
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:03,140
Hey, miss her.

1988
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:09,850
Check this out.

1989
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:18,740
Yes.

1990
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,360
Let's see what he does with it.

1991
02:06:29,370 --> 02:06:32,310
Oh, he has his own box over there!

1992
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:36,230
Okay, we gotta get rid of that box.

1993
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:38,850
I was like, he's probably putting it somewhere else for
sure.

1994
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:56,420
Oh wait, maybe he'll fill it up And then take it over to the
other side Maybe that's what we need to do Rather than What

1995
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:57,560
I was gonna do was

1996
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:12,380
Feels like We're battling the Brickster What I thought was I
move his basket But I don't think so Take that

1997
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:19,520
I think that's the case, though.

1998
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:21,840
Let's hope.

1999
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:22,880
Let's hope.

2000
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:38,160
What was that sound?

2001
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,100
What was that sound?

2002
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,320
All right, there's only a couple more.

2003
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:49,580
Or empty his, so he needs to go get another one.

2004
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:55,120
But these are full, so I feel like he would bring the full
one over here, no?

2005
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:58,060
I don't know.

2006
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:03,560
I don't know which way it is.

2007
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:05,120
It's one way or the other.

2008
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:07,220
We either got to empty his or fill it up.

2009
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:15,290
Okay.

2010
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:19,130
I've never played this game before, guys.

2011
02:08:19,230 --> 02:08:21,570
So if I'm doing it wrong, don't get mad at me.

2012
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:22,390
I have no idea.

2013
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:29,980
If it's full?

2014
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:35,880
Or if I fill it up and And he does nothing?

2015
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,400
Then what I know is I can steal his box and he'll probably
go get another one.

2016
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:44,880
So that's what we'll do.

2017
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:49,960
We'll figure out which is the method.

2018
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:53,320
How could you goose incorrectly?

2019
02:08:54,980 --> 02:08:58,600
I feel like they wouldn't make you do this, but at the same
time, who knows?

2020
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,640
I feel like there's just so many...

2021
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:01,940
There were so many tomatoes.

2022
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:20,720
but why else would they give you so many to pick up if it
weren't to if this weren't the case to take them back and

2023
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:29,180
forth but it's like so many to take back and forth I don't
know it's a good experiment yeah we're experimenting

2024
02:09:33,210 --> 02:09:42,390
you're too cute to give mother also hi me though hi Eric I
drop and honk drop it like a tonk drop it like a tonk drop

2025
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:47,470
it I wonder what happens if I honk with tomato.

2026
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:03,620
Whoa, that was close.

2027
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:15,980
No, sir, where are you going?

2028
02:10:18,220 --> 02:10:19,100
Over here.

2029
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:22,820
Oh, my God, he's stupid.

2030
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:34,770
The floor is honking.

2031
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:36,530
Whatever could it be?

2032
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:54,410
it's crazy how much beer is in that cake what a backer yeah
what a backer all right let's see was my hypothesis correct

2033
02:10:54,410 --> 02:11:07,280
my hypothesis was incorrect no

2034
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:26,600
way he's onto you.

2035
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:28,880
Operation Drop and Honk is in danger.

2036
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:33,160
Now we do the opposite.

2037
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:38,020
We just...

2038
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:40,900
No one will notice the red spheres underneath.

2039
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:45,400
Oh my god, they'll just rot under here and become smelly.

2040
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:49,960
They'll rot, they'll mold.

2041
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,520
We'll create a new colony, a new species from this batch of
tomato.

2042
02:11:56,200 --> 02:12:01,280
You ever feel like that when you have really moldy food in
your fridge and you're like, I'm another life.

2043
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,380
Your maternal instincts really just kick in.

2044
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:10,860
Metal Gear.

2045
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:12,020
Mint Goose.

2046
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:13,840
That's me.

2047
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:15,500
Hi, Lord Crosses.

2048
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:16,380
Welcome back.

2049
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:18,360
Kind of, yeah.

2050
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,260
Sometimes I eat it, too.

2051
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:20,800
Oh.

2052
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:23,060
Oh.

2053
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:28,670
The mold, mother.

2054
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:33,250
Wait, I just realized.

2055
02:12:33,450 --> 02:12:34,810
Can I get through this?

2056
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:39,190
With a little difficulty, but we can.

2057
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:47,810
I wish there was a way to grab the whole box, but it does
not appear to be the case.

2058
02:12:48,810 --> 02:12:52,470
It does not appear to be a way to grab the entire box, if
you were wondering.

2059
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:54,090
Which is crazy!

2060
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:56,950
We've grabbed so many other things with our beak.

2061
02:13:00,790 --> 02:13:01,670
Mold phantom.

2062
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:03,550
Same color.

2063
02:13:04,650 --> 02:13:05,090
Ha ha ha.

2064
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:06,650
look

2065
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:19,670
at all your things are gone

2066
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:42,740
yes yes you notice it's gone yes you must go retrieve more
yes yes uh yes I'm just gonna go on ahead while he ponders

2067
02:13:42,740 --> 02:14:07,200
that oh my gosh she saw me my tomates yes yes he's still in
shock when will we know that he is on a tomato run

2068
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:23,930
wait I just noticed there's a hole there do I see that in
the fence

2069
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:30,350
Hello, ma'am.

2070
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:31,690
Could you please leave?

2071
02:14:34,890 --> 02:14:36,350
Was that him?

2072
02:14:38,550 --> 02:14:40,270
Please say yes.

2073
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:42,990
Please let it be him.

2074
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:51,440
It was not.

2075
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:52,840
What?

2076
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:01,890
I'm gonna go through the hole.

2077
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:07,390
I did it.

2078
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:12,130
Can you take the empty box?

2079
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:14,510
Maybe if it's empty, well, like...

2080
02:15:15,550 --> 02:15:16,310
Like, let's see.

2081
02:15:16,430 --> 02:15:17,590
Let's practice with this one.

2082
02:15:18,010 --> 02:15:19,850
It won't even let me take this one, you know?

2083
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:22,190
So I'm not quite sure.

2084
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:39,440
Yeah, it won't let me take the box.

2085
02:15:44,140 --> 02:15:45,400
Put one tomato.

2086
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:47,780
A singular one.

2087
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:56,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2088
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:25,410
the other box but like how does that get him to how does
that unless the one beneath the bucket yeah I had there were

2089
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:28,370
tomatoes that's where we got all the tomatoes you guys

2090
02:16:31,950 --> 02:16:39,930
maybe he wants one so he put one there I'm so confused.

2091
02:16:43,070 --> 02:16:45,490
Like, I don't understand this man's way of thinking.

2092
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:48,190
What is the logic here, sir?

2093
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:52,470
What's the logic?

2094
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:00,180
Yeah?

2095
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:04,000
Yes?

2096
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,820
And he goes back!

2097
02:17:35,150 --> 02:17:37,710
I tried chasing him before with the tomato.

2098
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:39,610
He just puts him in his own box.

2099
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:43,870
I'll try lowering him to the door.

2100
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:45,170
Maybe we could do that.

2101
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:49,700
With the tomato.

2102
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:52,600
Like I'll make him chase me.

2103
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:55,820
And then drop it.

2104
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:12,610
Oh my god, wait.

2105
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:17,990
Oh, oh.

2106
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:20,070
That might be the perfect timing.

2107
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:21,330
chance!

2108
02:18:21,710 --> 02:18:21,950
Yeah!

2109
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:31,180
Good!

2110
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,260
Oh, what happened?

2111
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:33,780
Ah!

2112
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:35,520
Dummy.

2113
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:38,800
No, you ruined all those.

2114
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:48,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2115
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:48,760
Sorry.

2116
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:49,960
Oh, oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

2117
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:53,160
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry It's a new onboard.

2118
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:57,780
Oh my goodness.

2119
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:12,010
Maybe I guess as usual I overthought the equation.

2120
02:19:13,590 --> 02:19:15,490
I overthought the situation.

2121
02:19:19,330 --> 02:19:22,950
Now would be a good time to throw the glass in the river,
that's true, but I want to move on.

2122
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:24,950
I'm sick of this dealing with this man.

2123
02:19:25,170 --> 02:19:27,470
I don't want to do, I don't want to deal with him anymore!

2124
02:19:29,970 --> 02:19:31,370
Oh please, please.

2125
02:19:38,430 --> 02:19:39,730
Was that it?

2126
02:19:40,770 --> 02:19:41,870
Did he do the thing?

2127
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:49,840
How do I move on?

2128
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:54,440
Did I actually distract him so that he couldn't...

2129
02:20:02,170 --> 02:20:02,650
Maybe...

2130
02:20:02,650 --> 02:20:03,550
Oh wait, hold on.

2131
02:20:04,510 --> 02:20:05,970
I wonder if I can get in here.

2132
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:18,100
Oh!

2133
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:20,660
Oh my gosh, I just saw it!

2134
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:22,640
Oh no.

2135
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:23,500
Oh my gosh.

2136
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:27,680
Oh.

2137
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:30,180
Where are we now?

2138
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:31,260
Where are we now?

2139
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:34,980
Little people.

2140
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:37,680
Get into the model village.

2141
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:38,400
I'm here.

2142
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:42,260
Steal the beautiful miniature golden bell.

2143
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:43,980
I will.

2144
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:45,180
Oh my god.

2145
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:47,160
Now I don't even deal with real people.

2146
02:20:48,940 --> 02:20:49,580
Oh my gosh.

2147
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:50,180
It's a maze.

2148
02:20:53,390 --> 02:20:58,910
why does this exist okay there's no

2149
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:22,160
okay hello hello Mr. Gardner hello Mr. Gardner oh this is
all the spots that we went to Kaiju goose yes I remember I

2150
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:24,420
just I put stuff in here.

2151
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:26,260
Yeah.

2152
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:33,100
Yes, yes, I remember.

2153
02:21:33,380 --> 02:21:34,700
And then this guy.

2154
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:36,300
We're going to kill you.

2155
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:38,560
We're going to actually murder you.

2156
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:41,900
Okay, he's drowning.

2157
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:44,000
Nobody help him.

2158
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:48,280
Why is there only one objective, though?

2159
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:49,640
It's kind of scary.

2160
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:51,420
What is this?

2161
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:52,840
Oh!

2162
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:57,820
Yeah!

2163
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:00,560
Yeah!

2164
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:02,500
Knock it down.

2165
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:05,840
Yes!

2166
02:22:06,580 --> 02:22:07,300
What's this?

2167
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:08,060
Oh, whoops.

2168
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:13,570
Yes!

2169
02:22:14,290 --> 02:22:14,830
Yes!

2170
02:22:15,490 --> 02:22:16,310
Destroy!

2171
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:17,330
Destroy!

2172
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:20,350
Yeah!

2173
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:31,820
What's our new?

2174
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:34,220
And take it all the way back home.

2175
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:37,280
Is this my goal the whole time?

2176
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:37,980
Oh my god, wait.

2177
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,780
How am I supposed to get through with this thing?

2178
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:41,900
It's gonna alert every guard.

2179
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:44,520
Our prize!

2180
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:46,320
Game has morphed into rampage.

2181
02:22:52,330 --> 02:22:53,650
Goose coming through!

2182
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:55,630
Goose on the loose!

2183
02:22:56,810 --> 02:22:57,850
Everybody look out!

2184
02:22:58,950 --> 02:23:01,390
I'm a goose with a plan!

2185
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:03,510
Uh, can I get through?

2186
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:04,590
There we go.

2187
02:23:07,490 --> 02:23:08,290
Ding-ling-ling!

2188
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:16,860
What is this now?

2189
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:18,500
A lock, huh?

2190
02:23:19,400 --> 02:23:19,960
Interesting.

2191
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:25,040
Okay, if I don't run, it doesn't ring.

2192
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:25,740
I won't.

2193
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:27,440
Wait, does this take me home?

2194
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:30,700
Take me home!

2195
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:32,360
Contrary.

2196
02:23:43,510 --> 02:23:45,470
You can't take the shortcut.

2197
02:23:48,490 --> 02:23:49,270
Oh my gosh.

2198
02:23:49,470 --> 02:23:51,810
What if it's like Minecraft where they're like, Oh no!

2199
02:23:52,430 --> 02:23:53,510
The bell is ringing.

2200
02:23:54,050 --> 02:23:54,970
Something is attacking.

2201
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:00,920
I have to go all the way back, baby.

2202
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:03,080
I think from here, though, it's not so bad.

2203
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:05,120
She saw the bell.

2204
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,460
Oh shoot.

2205
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:10,340
They don't want me taking the bell.

2206
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:13,100
Uh-oh.

2207
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:15,400
Okay.

2208
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:16,800
Alright.

2209
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,220
That's fine.

2210
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:20,140
Oh, the tomatoes.

2211
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:22,500
Oh,

2212
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:29,390
shoot.

2213
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:32,390
Oh, shoot.

2214
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:43,880
No!

2215
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:46,020
No, that's mine!

2216
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:46,780
No, please!

2217
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:48,980
No, please!

2218
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:49,620
Give it back!

2219
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:50,200
Oh, shoot.

2220
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:50,680
I...

2221
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:51,620
Oh, oh, shoot.

2222
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:51,980
Oh, shoot.

2223
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:54,320
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2224
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,500
Oh, oh,

2225
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:07,500
oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

2226
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:10,440
All right.

2227
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:11,860
Final level.

2228
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:13,960
Boss time.

2229
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:15,900
Okay.

2230
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:17,480
Please, let me go through.

2231
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:21,340
They'll never see.

2232
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:23,320
They'll never know.

2233
02:25:24,380 --> 02:25:25,600
They'll never know.

2234
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:29,640
I wonder what's over there.

2235
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:34,760
Wait, do I have to go this way?

2236
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,020
I!

2237
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:47,360
Where am I?

2238
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:48,900
I'm lost.

2239
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,260
I'm a goose, but I have no home.

2240
02:25:56,840 --> 02:26:01,920
I'm gonna hide it right here so I can look around real
quick.

2241
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:03,980
Go goose go!

2242
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:08,620
I want to make a wish.

2243
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:12,160
Can I hit it?

2244
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:14,860
Can I get it in that tiny little hole right there?

2245
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:15,880
You see it?

2246
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:17,640
You see that tiny hole?

2247
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:21,480
I almost had it.

2248
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:25,920
Make a wish!

2249
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:26,600
Make a wish!

2250
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:29,680
Make a wish on a star.

2251
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:31,660
Oh.

2252
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:33,240
Rude.

2253
02:26:36,360 --> 02:26:37,620
Ash or smite or sure.

2254
02:26:37,700 --> 02:26:38,160
Welcome back.

2255
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:39,140
Thank you.

2256
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:42,980
At least I have no one chasing me right now.

2257
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:47,740
Locked.

2258
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:49,920
Locked.

2259
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:50,740
Why is it?

2260
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:52,000
She blocked the road.

2261
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:52,220
Wait.

2262
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:56,440
Oh, this is the gate.

2263
02:26:58,040 --> 02:26:58,540
Okay.

2264
02:26:59,020 --> 02:26:59,580
Oh, she got...

2265
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:01,260
Oh, she fixed it.

2266
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:02,120
How sweet.

2267
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:07,320
The rose is on the ground.

2268
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:09,500
What's going on here?

2269
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:11,220
Oh, they're patrolling.

2270
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:12,240
Oh, my God, scary.

2271
02:27:13,260 --> 02:27:14,100
Wait, what's happening?

2272
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:16,080
Oh, he's fixing it.

2273
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:24,420
Alright.

2274
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:26,940
Let's go get my bell an attempt.

2275
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:30,860
Wait, I'm gonna scope out as well.

2276
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:33,320
I'm gonna scope and see it.

2277
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:37,000
If this is still a viable way of getting over?

2278
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:39,620
It's not!

2279
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:46,400
You're not gonna fix it, though, right?

2280
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:48,360
How could you?

2281
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:51,920
Yeah, exactly.

2282
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:55,860
Okay.

2283
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:57,700
Goose retcon, recon.

2284
02:27:58,240 --> 02:27:59,120
Not retcon, sorry.

2285
02:27:59,700 --> 02:28:00,740
Goose recon, exactly.

2286
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:02,260
But they're gonna be mad.

2287
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:05,340
I'm gonna be mad if they see me with this bell.

2288
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:07,580
They're gonna be angri.

2289
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:09,800
The whole town is out to get me.

2290
02:28:10,220 --> 02:28:11,060
Right now, guys.

2291
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:14,260
No!

2292
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:15,100
No!

2293
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:15,360
No!

2294
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:16,480
Oh my gosh, they're so fast!

2295
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:18,700
They're so fast with it!

2296
02:28:30,970 --> 02:28:32,430
Oh no, it's been boarded up!

2297
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:34,930
How does one escape?

2298
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:40,010
I did not do any recon on this area!

2299
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:41,150
Okay.

2300
02:28:42,890 --> 02:28:43,870
Is he gonna see me?

2301
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:02,400
Oh my gosh.

2302
02:29:05,220 --> 02:29:05,720
Oh my gosh.

2303
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:07,180
Don't turn around.

2304
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:14,780
I'm stressed, bro.

2305
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:16,780
My pants are sweating.

2306
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:21,420
I assume I have to get past him.

2307
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:26,140
But he's...

2308
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:28,220
Gotta bait him further.

2309
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:30,240
I think if I...

2310
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:42,290
Wait, he's gonna see it, though.

2311
02:29:51,150 --> 02:29:53,150
Loop him, loop him, loop him, and run.

2312
02:29:57,930 --> 02:29:59,190
Where's the way out?

2313
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:00,970
Oh, there it is.

2314
02:30:03,650 --> 02:30:04,630
See ya, sucker.

2315
02:30:06,670 --> 02:30:07,850
I'm gooseing along.

2316
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:10,610
Is it this way?

2317
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:13,750
Let's hide our bell again.

2318
02:30:14,510 --> 02:30:15,050
Do some recon.

2319
02:30:16,170 --> 02:30:17,150
Goose reconnaissance.

2320
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:18,210
We're right now.

2321
02:30:24,980 --> 02:30:25,220
Evil.

2322
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:26,400
Evil man.

2323
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,560
The music keeps popping up.

2324
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:32,400
I know!

2325
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,780
It's scaring me!

2326
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:37,840
Okay guys.

2327
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:38,520
Alright.

2328
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:39,920
We just gotta get home.

2329
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:43,420
Why is it so spooky sounding?

2330
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:44,460
The music sometimes.

2331
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:58,510
Oh, this is the lady of this, yeah.

2332
02:31:00,770 --> 02:31:02,090
The grocery store.

2333
02:31:06,130 --> 02:31:06,810
Oh my god.

2334
02:31:08,550 --> 02:31:09,050
Don't see me?

2335
02:31:09,630 --> 02:31:10,650
You don't see me.

2336
02:31:11,310 --> 02:31:12,150
You don't see me.

2337
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:37,120
Everybody in the town is looking for me, you guys.

2338
02:31:37,460 --> 02:31:38,460
This is so bad.

2339
02:31:38,860 --> 02:31:40,700
Everybody in town is looking for me.

2340
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:42,980
Oh!

2341
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:45,560
No!

2342
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:46,040
Dang it!

2343
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:46,280
Dang

2344
02:31:53,020 --> 02:31:53,740
it!

2345
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:54,140
Nice.

2346
02:31:57,660 --> 02:31:59,720
They're faster than me too!

2347
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:04,180
Trip!

2348
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:05,680
Trip in the...

2349
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:05,920
Ah!

2350
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:13,870
Stealth is optional!

2351
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:16,410
Oh my god, they're still chasing after me.

2352
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:16,750
Okay.

2353
02:32:17,090 --> 02:32:17,950
They can't get in here.

2354
02:32:18,790 --> 02:32:19,430
But the...

2355
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:20,370
But the...

2356
02:32:20,370 --> 02:32:21,030
But the farmer.

2357
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:21,870
Oh!

2358
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:30,580
We meet again.

2359
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:31,760
Oh, the man.

2360
02:32:31,780 --> 02:32:34,840
We meet again!

2361
02:32:36,440 --> 02:32:38,660
For our final showdown.

2362
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:42,160
He's waiting for you arms crossed and all.

2363
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:44,280
He's like, I'm not even gonna...

2364
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:45,580
I'm not even gonna search for you.

2365
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:49,100
I know where you're headed to, you silly goose.

2366
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:51,760
Ring it.

2367
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:16,740
You are not smarter than I!

2368
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:18,220
Old farmer!

2369
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:20,340
Oh shoot, wait, my bell.

2370
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:21,220
Wait, wait.

2371
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:23,380
Yeah!

2372
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:26,300
Yeah!

2373
02:33:30,700 --> 02:33:32,300
Wait, where is my home?

2374
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:35,520
Take it all the way back home.

2375
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:36,500
Where do I start?

2376
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:37,360
Again.

2377
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:48,600
Maybe across the bridge.

2378
02:33:58,960 --> 02:33:59,520
This way?

2379
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:02,360
I think so.

2380
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:04,220
La la la.

2381
02:34:05,420 --> 02:34:06,580
La la la.

2382
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:08,560
No, no.

2383
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:09,980
Ah.

2384
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:20,960
Oh, over here.

2385
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:26,020
Take it home.

2386
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:26,440
Take

2387
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:29,980
it.

2388
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:32,520
My children, I have returned.

2389
02:34:34,540 --> 02:34:35,560
What is this?

2390
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:37,840
I have returned.

2391
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:39,800
Wait.

2392
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:43,400
I remember now that pile of bells.

2393
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,580
No way.

2394
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:47,840
Wait a second.

2395
02:34:49,660 --> 02:34:50,540
I...

2396
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:52,080
No way.

2397
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:55,940
another one to the pile

2398
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:20,440
this ain't our first rodeo no wonder they hate me wait a
second I really have just been causing them grief this

2399
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:26,440
entire time a goose as the goose

2400
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:32,920
do you see why they have the signs

2401
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:51,460
We have caused so much grief In this little city Oh my gosh
I didn't even remember the bell pile Until like the very

2402
02:35:51,460 --> 02:36:04,760
Last second Now go get the big bell Taco Bell No of course
we're not the bad guy Of course not She's having to return

2403
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:05,320
everything.

2404
02:36:09,240 --> 02:36:10,180
Kodak ring.

2405
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:11,780
That's the gardener.

2406
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:14,440
They say he can grow anything.

2407
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:17,240
That sun hat of his keeps bright light out of his eyes.

2408
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:18,860
So flash bangs are not an option.

2409
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:21,220
See if you can outsmart him somehow.

2410
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:28,800
Oh my god.

2411
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:37,080
It just shows your carnage.

2412
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:39,140
I loved that.

2413
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,320
I loved that.

2414
02:36:43,540 --> 02:36:44,860
It's so funny.

2415
02:36:45,580 --> 02:36:47,240
Darko, thank you so much for the pig.

2416
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:49,820
Thank you for a honking fun stream.

2417
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,180
You silly goose.

2418
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:52,280
Have a great meeting again.

2419
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:53,680
Quick cue.

2420
02:36:54,340 --> 02:36:59,780
Seeing goose's destructive behavior, I wonder, is it a baby
kaiju or is it an origin story?

2421
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,180
If so, what will it grow?

2422
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:04,160
What's grown-up kaiju name be?

2423
02:37:04,380 --> 02:37:09,300
I think it's truly shows how birds evolve.

2424
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:22,520
from dinosaurs you know oh I can I can still hug I can still
hug another one bites the dust minto add it to the list yeah

2425
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:33,480

02:38:23,710 --> 02:38:32,370
oh my god there's even more trap the boy in the garage catch
an object as it's thrown over the fence get thrown over the

2431
02:38:32,370 --> 02:38:40,830

To do quickly Oh my gosh there's speed runs no way

2433
02:38:59,410 --> 02:39:07,430
Cross out everything on the to-do list To do finally And
then there Some of these I didn't even complete like the

2434
02:39:07,430 --> 02:39:08,910
pint glass and the barefoot.

2435
02:39:09,550 --> 02:39:16,030
Most of them, most of them I did full, but it's the W's.

2436
02:39:16,310 --> 02:39:16,830
I'm sorry.

2437
02:39:19,090 --> 02:39:19,830
I'm sorry.

2438
02:39:24,750 --> 02:39:28,510
I think I have a trouble with the words that start with W.

2439
02:39:31,230 --> 02:39:34,250
The speedrun scene for this game is surprisingly complex.

2440
02:39:34,390 --> 02:39:38,190
I believe it because I feel like you Dude, it's crazy.

2441
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:43,390
Even in bird form, crime is the way she flies to you.

2442
02:39:43,530 --> 02:39:45,390
Or she's flying with criminal events.

2443
02:39:45,990 --> 02:39:46,650
Good job, Rito.

2444
02:39:46,690 --> 02:39:48,430

02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:53,150
This is so fun.

2447
02:39:55,050 --> 02:39:58,350
And like so stressful and relaxing at the same time.

2448
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:00,830

Do I have to roll it all the way to the picnic?

2464
02:41:31,650 --> 02:41:32,370
No way.

2465
02:41:32,830 --> 02:41:33,950
