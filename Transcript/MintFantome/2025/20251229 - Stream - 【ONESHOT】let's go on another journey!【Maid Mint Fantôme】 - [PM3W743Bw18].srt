00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,190
Okaidinaasaiyimase, go shenjin-tama, goit-go-shama.

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,190
Hello.

4
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,170
Moe, moe, boo!

5
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,710
My voice is still dead.

6
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,650
I'm still dead, sorry.

7
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,370
Hello.

8
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,190
Actually, hold on.

9
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,430
I'm going to move over.

10
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,690
Let's see.

11
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,140
If I do this.

12
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,640
Chica, chica, chica, chica, chica, chica.

13
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,320
Oh wait, I'm stupid.

14
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,940
Where am I doing that?

15
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,380
Oh, there we go.

16
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,700
There we go.

17
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,840
Yeah.

18
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,240
That sound better today?

19
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,020
I think so.

20
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,940
Yippee!

21
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,260
Yippee!

22
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,800
Needed a minute to take the Snake Ocelot?

23
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,340
Well, people...

24
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,380
Oh, yeah, definitely.

25
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,280
You know, that was a real big concern of mine.

26
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,080
I'd be so embarrassed if you guys saw that.

27
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,140
Because you guys would never expect that of me.

28
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,640
Peak fiction incoming.

29
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,520
Let me make sure mine.

30
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,040
Okay.

31
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,320
Okay, good.

32
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm playing this on controller.

33
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:17,820
I don't even know if this is a controller game, but I would
have to plug in a mouse and stuff to my other...

34
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,300
desktop.

35
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,920
As you can see, well, first of all, hello everybody.

36
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,780
Welcome to

37
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,680
OneShot.

38
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm playing on my tiny PC that you can see.

39
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,680
I've played Mystery of the Druids and Harvester on.

40
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,440
And I'm playing on desktop Scary!

41
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,480
So scary!

42
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,180
Wait a second.

43
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,020
Actually, I want to do something real quick before I...

44
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,100
I'm gonna disconnect from the internet.

45
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,920
I don't think anything will happen, but I'm scared.

46
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,620
Wait, how do I...

47
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,260
How do I...

48
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,980
Wait, why is my mouse not working?

49
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh, there it is.

50
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,250
Okay, good.

51
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:10,900
Disconnect.

52
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,540
Roadrunner cartoons.

53
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,920
Roadrunner cartoons.

54
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,640
What the heck are some of these?

55
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,880
Anyway, okay.

56
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
You didn't clear your history on this PC?

57
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,740
Okay, that's not what I'm afraid of.

58
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,060
Actually, no, you guys don't know what I'm into.

59
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,720
Maybe I would be a little scared of that.

60
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,820
There we go, okay.

61
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, we're off the grid.

62
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,220
We're off the grid.

63
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,060
But welcome to Lenshot.

68
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,820

I love?

69
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
Yes, this, this, this, this.

70
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,260

71
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,060

Which one?

76
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,300
Hello, Minto, and Aibu is like you, my tip for today.

77
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,120
Make sure your PC name isn't revealing or Fouiki.

78

Mine is Lunari!

79
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320

Admin.

85
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,250
Also, my Koharu wallpapers are all on my laptop.

86
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,270
I wonder if I should start using my laptop for this instead.

87
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,150
Well, no, my tiny PC works so

88
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,130
Well...

89
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,550
Adminto.

90
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,570
Also, this game is kind of funky.

91
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,990
Like, hold on, I mean.

92
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,110
Uh...

93
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,570
Uh-oh.

94
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,010
Wait.

95
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,430
Wait.

96
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:48,850
Wait.

97
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,890
Did it disconnect?

98
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,430
Oh!

99
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,770
Why isn't it working?

100
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,550
Allow.

101
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,050
Allow.

102
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:13,670
allow wait oh let me click on okay hold on click there we go
so there's like only full screen and obviously that works

103
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:23,470
like not very well on my actual desktop so that's why it's
not full screen here also i know the thing is is i don't

104
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,490
know anything about the story of this game but when you are

105
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:40,690
typically have to know games that are going to show file
names and things of the such so um i was told this game is

106
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:53,910
best played um best played in windowed mode so that's why
we're in window mode so i apologize you see the you see my

107
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,630
my very normie looking

108
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,230
So, yes.

109
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,790
Yeah, so unfortunately, you know, those kinds of meta things
are great if you're playing, like, by yourself.

110
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,410
But if you're streaming, you kind of have to know those
types of things.

111
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,910
So I apologize in advance.

112
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,490
Best played on Minto mode.

113
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,750
Yeah, frame skip on.

114
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,430

00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,260
feel bad for him but i'm mad at him I'm trying to be as
non-spoilery as possible.

179
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm mad at Jesse.

180
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,580
I'm mad at him.

181
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,560
I'm really mad at him.

182
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,080
I don't feel bad for him, but I'm mad at him.

183
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,440
Why would he do that?

184
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,180
Yeah, Jesse's going through it.

185
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,140
But like, he did it to himself!

186
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,380
I'm so angry.

187
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,580
Ugh!

188
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,900
Not angry, just disappointed.

189
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,180
I think that's it, man.

190
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,600
And...

191
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,280
And...

192
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,620
So, at the very, like, one of the very last scenes...

193
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,620
When Skylar is going off on Walter...

194
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,820
At first I was like...

195
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,080
Because, okay, he is about to have the surgery, right?

196
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,820
And then he says the thing...

197
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,040
About the cell phones.

198
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,660
And Skylar's like...

199
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,620
Click!

200
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,560
Click!

201
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,100
Click!

202
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,680
And then she goes...

203
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,740
Then she goes off on him.

204
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,600
And at first I was like, okay...

205
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,680
but like, can't...

206
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,000
I know he's been acting weird, but can't...

207
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,260
My man can't have a mental breakdown that's not real, but
you can't just have a mental breakdown these days and not be

208
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,080
questioned for it.

209
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,200
I mean, I know his was fake, but come on!

210
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,460
My man can't have a...

211
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,460
He can't just have a mental breakdown now anymore!

212
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,860
And I was kind of getting frustrated at her while she was
going off on him and then and then she started picking apart

213
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:50,420
his lies like crazy and then I was like wait a second oh no
wait she reversed cooked him oh no wait no wait this is good

214
00:17:50,420 --> 00:18:07,800
oh no oh no she like clocked him so oh oh dang I was like
let's go yeah she's not dumb Mm-hmm.

215
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,060
At first I was like, no, Skyler, you're being kind of like
critical.

216
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,520
And then I was like, oh no, wait, she knows.

217
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,660
Oh she knows.

218
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,740
My thing about her was that she was like, you need to get
out of the house.

219
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,760
But she wasn't communicating to him.

220
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,100
And I was like, she's, everybody in the show is, they're
terrible.

221
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,280
They're terrible communicators.

222
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,960
Sorry, I'm talking about Breaking Bad.

223
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,540
She's more unsympathetic later.

224
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,830
If it's for reasons, I think, that are starting to appear,
then I understand.

225
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,690
But, everybody's bad communicators.

226
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,050
What about Walt Jr.?

227
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,790
I love Walt Jr. I think he's so stinking cute.

228
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,930
He's so cute.

229
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,290
I love Walt Jr.

230
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:18,610
Mint doing the most American thing ever This is the exact
conversations I heard back at work on New Year Get online,

231
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,850

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,750
Couple!

233
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,830
Walt Jr. gives me Smallville guy vibes.

234
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,550
Oh, the guy that is...

235
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,030
Superman?

236
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,050
Yes, I know what you mean.

237
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,410
I like you, Minto.

238
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,430
Please don't blow up.

239
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,210
What do you...

240
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,390
What do you know that I do not know?

241
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,670
Clark Smallville.

242
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,150
Yeah!

243
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,330
But yeah, sorry.

244
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,950
I was just watching Breaking Bad.

245
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,770
Literally up until this stream.

246
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,990
I was like, I think I can finish season 2 before stream
starts.

247
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,270
And I did!

248
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,070
So...

249
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:11,930
Um...

250
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,510
Yeah, I like the show a little bit.

251
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,730
Which characters are you rooting for?

252
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,310
Um...

253
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,170
It's not that I'm rooting for anybody.

254
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,390
I think everybody has their goods and their bads.

255
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,530
Um, I actually...

256
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,470
This is gonna sound really weird, maybe.

257
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,570
I actually think Hank is kind of, like, Moe.

258
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,870
Vivi Kaur, thank you for the gift, Like, he's a terrible
guy, don't get me wrong, but he's also, like, kind of moi.

259
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,180
There's, like, a lot of really moi characters in the show.

260
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,320
Parse!

261
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,400
So, welcome to Mambushifna, thank you!

262
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,640
They're all bad.

263
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,660
Yeah, they're all bad.

264
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,060
But Hank is, like, kind of cute.

265
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,900
He's like...

266
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:15,840
I don't know.

267
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Like, he's just got such like a kind of character about him.

268
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,220
It's kind of cute.

269
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,460
Is that what they mean by gap moe?

270
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,580
You're on a streak of just playing all my favorite games
right now.

274
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,080
Thank you, Pop Man.

275
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,380
Hang is toxic masculinity, but he's goofy.

276
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,020
Yeah, that's literally it.

277
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,800
That's literally it.

278
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,680
Like, he's definitely got his points where I'm like, Hank.

279
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,160
Oh, come on, Hank.

280
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,540
I agree with the other super chat.

281
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,560
Please don't explode.

282
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Eric, what do you know?

283
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,200
What do you know?

284
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,050
I love Mike?

285
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,770
I don't think I've met Mike yet.

286
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,430
Wait.

287
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,930
Is Mike the one that cleans up Jesse's apartment?

288
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,070
Okay, I do like him already.

289
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,030
That's my.

290
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,450
Okay, okay.

291
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,760
Oh, that's finger.

292
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,340
Am I getting spoiled?

293
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,080
I don't care if I'm spoiled of his name.

294
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,260
Can't stop noticing that the only game installed on your
desktop besides OneShot is Freaking Mystery of the Druids.

295
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,920
Um, you missed Harvester.

296
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,580
right there.

297
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,100
Ghost, cutie!

298
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,060
Thank you so much for succeeding, boss.

299
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,800
Thank you.

300
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,960
Sorry, I want to make sure my...

301
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,740
My controller does not die on me.

302
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,820
Um, what was I gonna do?

303
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,560
Maybe I should start.

304
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,020
Roadrunner cartoons.

305
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,700
Roadrunner cartoons.

306
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,500
When you finish the show, a spoiler-filled membership stream
where you talk about all your thoughts on Breaking Bad would

307
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,020
be awesome.

308
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,440
I feel like, though, I should finish Better Call Saul.

309
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,400
too, though, Ne.

310
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,840
No?

311
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,760
You think?

312
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,080
Kale!

313
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,040
Welcome to membership, thank you!

314
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,520
Jesse's a good guy, but is easily manipulated.

315
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,060
I know.

316
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,800
I know.

317
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,460
Made Minto of the suspiciously clean desktop.

318
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,780
What is your wisdom of the day?

319
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:50,880
Um.

320
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,440
Never watch Roadrunner cartoons.

321
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,340
They're too violent.

322
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,130
You'd be okay, I think, because give more aspect of Breaking
Bad.

323
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,870
Well, no, I mean, like, I don't want people to spoil Better
Call Saul for me too, right?

324
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,350
I think?

325
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,230
Probably.

326
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,050
So I should finish Breaking Bad, then watch Better Call
Saul, and then have a...

327
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,310
Sorry.

328
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,150
Discussion stream.

329
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,890
Your windows has updates.

330
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,850
Don't look at my... Don't look at my updates!

331
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,840
Did it do?

332
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:50,980
No!

333
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,000
Don't make fun of my stutter!

334
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,520
Don't make fun of my stutter!

335
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,480
What can we learn about this photo?

336
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,860
I don't know.

337
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,980
It probably is like...

338
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,300
Aliens.

339
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,400
Aliens.

340
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,020
We will have the talk.

341
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,880
The talk?

342
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,420
The boids and the breeze?

343
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,800
Shall we start the game?

344
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,240
One shot.

345
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,440
I think it's a bit of a longer game, so it might be a bit of
a longer stream.

346
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,080
Choose a day.

347
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,020
And yeah.

348
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,260
We will complete it.

349
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,460
Is your desktop 4-3?

350
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,740
Yes.

351
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,040
Don't worry about it.

352
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,040
Horrible flight issues, please.

353
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,840
Bless my safe return, Vicky.

354
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,520
Oh, no!

355
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,440
I've heard nothing but...

356
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,240
Flight issues recently.

357
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,480
I'll be get home safe.

358
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,220
Such a great day to be a wisp.

359
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,120
Absolutely nothing could ruin this day.

360
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,220
Yippee!

361
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,260
How do you keep it so clean?

362
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,960
Do you just uninstall everything when you're done?

363
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,400
Oh no, I don't use this.

364
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,860
I don't use this computer for anything except...

365
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,260
Except this.

366
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,180
This tiny PC.

367
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,680
It's only for stream game.

368
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,480
Like this.

369
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,460
Midwest weather just brutal today.

370
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,240
No!

371
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Oh!

372
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,160
Whimdy!

373
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,000
Whimdy!

374
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,660
Is it... much...

375
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,820
Air.

376
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
Whimdy.

377
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Oh, my God.

378
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,620
Very, very windy.

379
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,540
Flash freeze warning.

380
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,180
Oh, I saw!

381
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:08,380
For the U.S., there is right now a very powerful cold that
is flowing through the states of the United States.

382
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,420
It's a very powerful cold that is going around.

383
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,700
Stay warm, everybody.

384
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,500
The winter is happening.

385
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,640
Meteorologist.

386
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,160
Meteorologist.

387
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,280
Here.

388
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,600
With your update.

389
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,420
Of your location.

390
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Give me your location.

391
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,700
Winter is coming.

392
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,200
Should I want...

393
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,380
No.

394
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,520
I was going to say, should I...

395
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,680
That's a...

396
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,620
Not Breaking Bad.

397
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,040
I only have Breaking Bad.

398
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,220
That's...

399
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,980
Dun- no, not Dungeons and Dragons.

400
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,700
Not dueling dragons.

401
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,460
There's dragons involved.

402
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,880
There's dragons involved.

403
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, gosh.

404
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,680
Hold on.

405
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,140
Don't tell me.

406
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,000
Don't tell me.

407
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,460
Don't tell me.

408
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Don't tell me.

409
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:56,860
Don't tell me.

410
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,360
Don't tell me.

411
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,560
Red Wedding.

412
00:27:59,760 --> 00:27:59,940
Hold on.

413
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,380
I'm making the connection in my brain.

414
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,900
Red Wedding.

415
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,360
De-dean-eris.

416
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,420
Oh, oh, Game of Thrones!

417
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,420
Wait, was that the one that just says the winter is coming?

418
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,480
We're getting cooked down here.

419
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,060
I wish we could trade temperatures.

420
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,440
Oh, yeah, I bet.

421
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,380
I bet Gato.

422
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,100
Still 80 degrees.

423
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,040
80 degrees.

424
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,700
Here in my state, sadly, I don't get the wintertime vibe.

425
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,400
No, that was Florida for me, though.

426
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,500
Dragon Ball.

427
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,260
Got a seven-hour drive.

428
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:43,920
Keep me company.

429
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,500
Okay!

430
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,240
Bonjour, minto, greetings from Florence.

431
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,620
I am happy that I can finally catch some live stream!

432
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,800
Gonna chill on my couch while enjoying this new journey.

433
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,540
Scratch!

434
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,040
Merci beaucoup!

435
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,060
Shall we start then?

436
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,300
The people need the...

437
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,360
The people need the journey to entertain.

438
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,320
System Papa, Min Phantom has acquired your location.

439
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,780
Do you acknowledge this information?

440
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,630
Thank you for the super chance!

441
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,730
Thank you.

442
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,230
Okay.

443
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,750
Start up.

444
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,090
Dedicated to our beloved friend Felix.

445
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,650
No!

446
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,320
Examine.

447
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,340
Cancel.

448
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,600
Sorry.

449
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,340
Walk.

450
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,600
Walk fast RT.

451
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,620
Menu.

452
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Inventory.

453
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,880
Okay.

454
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,180
Configure.

455
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,460
Inventory is why.

456
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:01,740
Okay.

457
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,980
I guess I could have played Dishon.

458
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,680
But it's okay.

459
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,840
I'm fine with controller too.

460
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,540
Explore and interact with the environment and character.

461
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,920
Sometimes you may find an item.

462
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,800
Once you have picked up an item, you may select it from your
inventory.

463
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,220
When the item is active, you can either combine it with
other items in the inventory or use it at certain locations

464
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,480
in order to progress.

465
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,420
Although full screen is an option, the game is best
experienced in window mode.

466
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,100
save your progress.

467
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,720
This game also auto-says after some key f-events.

468
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,360
Awake.

469
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,540
Me.

470
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,400
Cute.

471
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,920
Oh, so cute.

472
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,840
What is this?

473
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,140
There's a TV remote here.

474
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,980
Nico picks it up.

475
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,500
A soft glowing light trickles through the window.

476
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,760
Dusty books.

477
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,780
It's too dark to read in here.

478
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,080
Nico just woke up here.

479
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,560
Door is locked.

480
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,300
What about this one?

481
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,600
Door is locked.

482
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,040
Oh my gosh.

483
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,380
It's been like a minute.

484
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,880
It's really strange playing RPG Maker game with a
controller.

485
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,420
Password.

486
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,300
8.008?

487
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,540
8.

488
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,040
Access denied.

489
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,520
Dang.

490
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,200
Is there a light switch somewhere?

491
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,950
How could I use it?

492
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,110
Doesn't respond to the remote.

493
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,750
Nico looks at the buttons on the remote, but they cannot be
red in the dark.

494
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,290
Perhaps a light would help.

495
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,210
Why is it in blue?

496
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,240
Is

497
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,090
it...

498
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:18,590
Oh!

499
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,530
Nico can glimpse the face of the remote.

500
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,790
All the numbers except 6932 are missing.

501
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,750
Ah!

502
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:33,390
So red six, nine yellow, three blue, two green.

503
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,490
Maybe six, nine, three, two.

504
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,770
They're marked in bright colors.

505
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,410
Maybe it's in order.

506
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,330
It's not, shoot.

507
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,570
Okay, this is six.

508
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,850
Oh, don't, not the boob again.

509
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:53,610
Sorry.

510
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,270
Six, nine, I was so close.

511
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,350
Three, two.

512
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,250
32, 16.

513
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,750
Access granted.

514
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,310
A PC on my PC.

515
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,910
You found me.

516
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,590
Menma!

517
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:21,570
Why?

518
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,730
You're already too late.

519
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,490
Not much of the world remains.

520
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,570
This will be apparent once you go outside.

521
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,890
This place was never worth it.

522
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:45,450
saving do you still want to try then remember this your
actions here will affect Nico their mission is to help Nico

523
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:58,710
leave and most importantly whoa that's a big actual computer
you only have one shot Advent oh wait oh gosh hold on

524
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,450
That's me!

525
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,130
Whoa!

526
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,490
Crazy!

527
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,810
So it would have said Minto if I were on my other computer.

528
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,030
Dang!

529
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,990
Add Minto.

530
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:26,750
I had to like use my mouse to...

531
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,310
Wait, I think I have to re-click it.

532
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,770
There we go.

533
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,890
Nico hears the sound of a door unlocking.

534
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,070
We have one shot, guys!

535
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,070
The name of the game!

536
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:34,910
Is it this one?

537
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:36,970
Hello?

538
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,770
Anyone?

539
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,510
What about this door?

540
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,930
The tub won't run.

541
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,970
Anything in the trash?

542
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,810
A withered plant sits here stiff and dry.

543
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,470
A branch snaps off.

544
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,530
I got it?

545
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:54,270
I think?

546
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,410
There's no need to do anything else to it.

547
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,310
Did I take that?

548
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,570
I took the dry branch.

549
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,550
Meantor real name admin leaked?

550
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,850
Stop it.

551
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,170
One opportunity.

552
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,210
A pair of luminous yellow eyes stares back at Nico.

553
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,470
It's me.

554
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,070
It's Nico.

555
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,770
There's no water in the toilet.

556
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,050
Oh, dang.

557
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,930
That means we can't reach our hand in there.

558
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,690
So we are...

559
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,530
I'm playing as Nico, but I'm clearly my own entity as well.

560
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,010
Admin is the name of the person I have to ask to install
things on the work computer.

561
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,590
I told you.

562
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,830
I'm everywhere.

563
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,350
I'm always haunting.

564
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,630
Never know where you're gonna find me.

565
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,270
I could be at your workplace.

566
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,950
At your home place.

567
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,430
At your girl's place.

568
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,790
At your boy's place.

569
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,250
At your mom's place.

570
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,070
Definitely at your mom's place.

571
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,970
The ghost in the machine.

572
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,590
What's this?

573
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,110
Wait.

574
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,890
Oh my gosh, it's so dark.

575
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,810
I can't see anything.

576
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,250
Oh, the remote.

577
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,330
The TV gives off a dangerous looking spark.

578
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:10,950
Spooky.

579
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,330
What is this?

580
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,770
Kihol.

581
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,800
Kitchen.

582
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,220
The sink won't turn on.

583
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
What's for dinner?

584
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,120
Inside the refrigerator is a bottle of alcohol.

585
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,720
Nico takes it.

586
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,720
Nico, I don't think you're old enough to drink, buddy.

587
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,060
Just a table.

588
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,260
That's what they all say.

589
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,980
Just a box, just a table.

590
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
And in reality...

591
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
The wood in the fireplace looks like it was never used.

592
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,420
Perhaps it could be lit.

593
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,180
It's lit.

594
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,860
Wait, can I...

595
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,280
Take the TV?

596
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,980
Oh wait, dry branch.

597
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,500
On here.

598
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,400
Nico readies the branch.

599
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,380
It doesn't manage to light.

600
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,180
Okay, we have to combine it with the alcohol.

601
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,780
Nico dips the branch into the alcohol.

602
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,400
Hey, you leave my boys alone.

603
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,120
Nico, ready is the branch?

604
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,500
Blue!

605
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,310
Someone say beer?

606
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,050
Cheers!

607
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,950
It's beer o'clock, baby!

608
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,690
What's this?

609
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,670
Something on the ground glimmers in the firelight.

610
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,730
It appears to be a small metallic object wedged into the
crack of the floor.

611
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,730
Nico digs it out.

612
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,790
Basement key!

613
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,100
Oh.

614
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,080
Equip the key.

615
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:02,900
Hello?

616
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,220
Use the key.

617
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,000
Uh...

618
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,210
The key, stick in the key.

619
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,810
Is there a door that I'm missing?

620
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,710
Oh!

621
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,910
Oh!

622
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,630
This is the basement.

623
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,070
Just kidding.

624
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,530
Can I have a light?

625
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,030
The sounds are kind of ASMR.

626
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,200
What's that?

627
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,040
Light bulb?

628
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,560
It is.

629
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,900
For lore reasons, no.

630
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,340
We did it.

631
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,180
We got the...

632
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Putting a deadlock.

633
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,520
desktop folder on the desk.

634
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Don't mind it.

635
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,700
Don't mind it.

636
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,600
Oh, that's why I couldn't get through.

637
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,760
Where'd all the music go, though?

638
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,120
Refrigerator is empty.

639
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:29,780
Ah.

640
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,600
What's with the giant yellow symbol on it, though?

641
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,560
It won't turn on.

642
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,520
Oh, okay.

643
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,490
Okay.

00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:56,890

You gotta dance like no one's watching.

654
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,980
And when I do that, definitely know what he's watching.

655
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,240
Shake it if you got it.

656
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,620
Even if you don't got it, just shake it.

657
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,200
Hmm.

658
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,520

00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,860
Oh, space.

00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,910
Is that a tower or a crack?

661
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:29,790
Oh.

visited by selecting the travel option in the menu the

default key for opening the menu is a fast travel cannot be

You're so right.

00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,440

689
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,640
i saw your tweet about drawing and i hope one day to see
your art i know sharing it can feel scary and vulnerable but

690
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:21,180
it's of the most satisfying hobbies i think i believe in you
thank you um i thought about actually making like a my a

691
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:32,840
separate a separate um uh twitter account like a sub twitter
account for it um what's left of a robot but mainly because

692
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:39,920
like you know it's kind of it just i don't want like the
pressure of like a bunch of people seeing it you know what i

693
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:53,920
mean especially when i don't feel so confident in it so
what's left of a robot what's this so i think i'll do that

694
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:08,280
and then maybe a robot it no longer has power maybe one day
i'll get good and i can you know feel better about it

695
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,420
i just have to make the account secret?

696
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,620
No, I don't think so.

697
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,500
I don't plan on making it secret.

698
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,300
I'll, like, announce it and say, Hey, guys, if you want to
see any art from me, which...

699
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,560
The horizon glows a faint green.

700
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:30,860
Green!

701
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:32,580
Oh.

702
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,050

703
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:38,610
Oh, my gosh.

704
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,790
It'll never be that good.

705
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,840
One thing I wanted to do is, like, I don't know.

706
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,460
I just want to I just want to try.

707
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:55,740
Oh!

708
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:56,780
Hello.

709
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:57,940
Um, hello?

710
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,180
Another...

711
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,740
Another...

712
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,300
Train?

713
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,540
Train car?

714
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,160
At least that's what it looks like.

715
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,120
Wait, did I go in a circle?

716
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,200
Oh no, this is another bed.

717
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,280
This bed probably looks familiar to you, Admin.

718
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,760
Nico first woke up in this world here.

719
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,840
It's important that you allow Nico to sleep once in a while.

720
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,100
Continued later.

721
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,120
Don't be alarmed.

722
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,320
But now is no time for rest.

723
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,680
Yeah, we just started.

724
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,560
Wait, what was that?

725
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,700
Broken off section of railing.

726
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,260
Ah!

727
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:45,880
Hi, hi, Minto.

728
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,440
Hope you're well.

729
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,440
You too, Brandon!

730
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,280
I hope you're getting lots of rest and recovering well.

731
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,800
I hope, I hope.

732
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,170
I wish I had a map.

733
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,310
I'm just kind of wandering.

734
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,150
The air here is unbreedable.

735
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,590
Oh, never mind, we leave.

736
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:11,810
That's a weird save mechanic.

737
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,450
I wonder if the game crashes after it saves.

738
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,670
They couldn't fix it.

739
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,530
I don't know.

740
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,310
It does say that the game saves automatically, so let me try
this side.

741
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,190
Just kidding.

742
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,130
My booty's too fat.

743
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:24,590
Okay.

744
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,830
Let's go back downstairs.

745
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,010
We did talk to this guy, right?

746
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:30,530
Yeah.

747
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,860
My bulb is too big, baby.

748
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,120
Damn, girl, where you get that bulb?

749
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,800
Dang, girl.

750
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,380
Now this is where we started.

751
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:47,540
Yeah.

752
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:48,840
No?

753
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:49,880
Yes.

754
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,100
Oh, wait, or is this...

755
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,340
Oh, this is just another car.

756
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,540
I didn't even notice it.

757
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,940
No, wait, that's definitely the one I came out of.

758
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:02,360
Weird.

759
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,720
I recently got a drawing pad to start my own art journey,
so, yeah, totally get not being confident.

760
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,040
You too, film!

761
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,660
Oh my gosh, we could learn together!

762
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,420
The thing is, is like...

763
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,880
I...

764
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,900
I...

765
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:20,940
Um...

766
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,180
I don't know.

767
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:28,400
I feel a little intimidated by it, but there's a lot more
things that I want to, like, try doing in 2026.

768
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,300
Applying myself more instead of just sitting on the couch
watching Breaking Bad for many hours.

769
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:48,660
it was a holdover from the old version where you really only
had one shot oh that's cool i want to try 3d again yeah like

770
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:55,740
i don't want to you know i'm not trying to like get into
blender or anything but like more 3d things um i don't know

771
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:07,680
like i'm trying not to spread myself too thin in terms of
activities that i pick up but what's left of a robot Oh,

772
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,200
that looks like a big robot.

773
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,500
What's left of a robot?

774
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,780
What are you?

775
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,140
Ah!

776
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:12,640
Sorry.

777
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,260
Ah!

778
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,480
You scared me!

779
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,360
That light bulb!

780
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,700
You are here!

781
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,880
Me?

782
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,240
Yes!

783
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,880
Welcome to our world, friend!

784
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,600
I am most humbled by your presence, yes.

785
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,300
Hello, thanks.

786
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,980
If you turned off the game and then without going to a bit,
bed you killed Nico and could never play the game again.

787
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,260
Oh my God, what the heck?

788
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,320
That's crazy.

789
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:49,980
Sorry.

790
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,360
I'm a little lost.

791
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:52,340
Alright.

792
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,160
Allow me to explain some things.

793
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,240
May I first ask how you arrived here?

794
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,220
I'm not sure.

795
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,240
I remember PewDiePie making a video of him learning to draw
and showing his progress.

796
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,540
I'd love to see your progress too.

797
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,240
Yeah!

798
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,620
I'm definitely...

799
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:20,000
I definitely would like to have like a a collection like a
you know where I can see my progress as well and the way my

800
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,500
style evolves and how I find my own style and stuff but um I
really was I was like I'm too nervous to post it on my main

801
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:34,780
account so I think I'll just post it on a sub account I've
never done that I've never made a sub account though I'm

802
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,920
kind of scared if you do get into blender just make sure
it's unplugged otherwise we'll get mint juice.

803
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,520
Stream drawing.

804
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,300
I could do that.

805
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,860
Um, it would probably be membership streams because I'm
nervous.

806
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,780
I'm not sure.

807
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,060
I woke up in this weird house.

808
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,720
It was really dark.

809
00:50:59,380 --> 00:50:59,720
Oh!

810
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,840
So you woke up in an unfamiliar dark location.

811
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:03,720
Mm-hmm.

812
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,380
Just as my prophecy foretold, yes!

813
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,340
You are the savior we have been waiting for.

814
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:10,860
for.

815
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,500
You will be the one to save our world from eternal darkness.

816
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,140
Oh my god, he did a dance.

817
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,180
Um, I will now provide you with vital information.

818
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,220
Oh god, she's gonna lore dump on me.

819
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,860
Learning new things for New Year goal is great.

820
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,860
I plan to get a ham radio license, private detective
license, notary license, and forklift.

821
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,100
I want to be forklift certified.

822
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,160
Eternal darkness?

823
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:43,940
No.

824
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:44,880
No.

825
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:45,600
No.

826
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,840
Please ask me anything.

827
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,060
Oh, well.

828
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,200
Can you tell me about this world?

829
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,060
I'm not sure where I am exactly.

830
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,980
I can't see too far off.

831
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,800
Everything's so dark.

832
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,060
Our world was not always this dim.

833
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,180
Nor was it so broken.

834
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,600
But time waits for nobody.

835
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,340
Not even saviors.

836
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,060
Oh.

837
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,340
This world is divided into three regions.

838
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,860
You're on the fringe right now.

839
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:13,860
The barons.

840
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,740
The tower you see in the distance once held our sun.

841
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,400
Oh, so that's what the tall thing was.

842
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Oh, it was a tower.

843
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,260
Okay, it was not a crack.

844
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,040
Paragon, paragon, paragon.

845
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,660
As you go further towards the center, you will cross the
other regions.

846
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,280
There should be a map still in this outpost somewhere.

847
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,280
Oh.

848
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,160
Can you tell me about the light bulb?

849
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,780
I found it in the house I woke up in.

850
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,220
Within your hands is our new son.

851
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,540
Your son?

852
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,120
Mom, Dad?

853
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:50,900
Yes.

854
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,120
Years ago, our previous son sat atop that tower and spilled
its life into the land.

855
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,260
But one day, the light went out.

856
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,120
Oh, the world is still hanging on by a thread.

857
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,140
The surface of this world is abundant with an element called
phosphor.

858
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,480
for us, this element stored light energy from our previous
sun.

859
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,120
It's now our only source of illumination, but its energy is
finite.

860
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,180
Oh no.

861
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,540
Minto can escape the dad allegation.

862
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,720
Maybe I really am a dad.

863
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,510
Maybe I really...

864
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,730
Do I really give off that much of dad energy?

865
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:41,910
I'm a dad.

866
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,290
I want to leave you guys for milk or nothing.

867
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:46,870
In fact, I wouldn't leave the house.

868
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,990
I don't want to go outside.

869
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:52,630
No.

870
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:53,470
No!

871
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,870
I'm a bottom.

872
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:02,730
I mean with Phoebe.

873
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,910
Salary men more than died?

874
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,610
Oh, that hurts.

875
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:09,890
What do you say?

876
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:10,630
Am I balding?

877
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,730
I guess not all salary men are balding.

878
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:14,730
Sorry to stereotype.

879
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:29,310
Hi Rinto, speaking of that, it's my birthday today.

880
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,350
Papita!

881
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:31,990
Wait, are you, duh?

882
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,010
Happy birthday!

883
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:35,750
Happy, happy birthday!

884
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,150
I booze are bald.

885
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,570
No, no, no.

886
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,870
I mean, bald is beautiful.

887
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,710
Even if you wear balding.

888
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,890
Honestly, if you're losing your hair, embrace the bald.

889
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,530
It's so much sexier.

890
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,990
After hearing you talk about trying out art, it recently
inspired me to pick up the pen again after going on hiatus

891
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,790
for five years.

892
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,090
Best of luck on your art journey.

893
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,490
Thank you, Ryan.

894
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,690
Thank you.

895
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:16,730
I, speaking, one thing I want to do, I have it planned for
next week is a membo stream where I draw membership profile

896
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,810
pictures.

897
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,610
So, I will do my best.

898
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,690
That's part of my journey in drawing.

899
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:28,890
Thank you, you are beautiful too.

900
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,330
Of course!

901
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,430
Both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both.

902
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,940
Now, so I will try to...

903
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,080
How will you pick?

904
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,180
I'm not sure yet.

905
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,280
I'm still deciding.

906
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,730
Incoming 1000 profile pictures.

907
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,650
to draw, Moon may learn it the hard way.

908
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,690
If I have a thousand profile pictures to draw, I will draw
1,000 profile pictures.

909
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:08,710
Even if I have to draw a couple a day or something, even if
it takes a while, I will do my best.

910
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,930
I mean, do I happen to have Metal Gear Dream and it's your
fault.

911
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,330
I was in your dream!

912
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:15,950
What are you saying?

913
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,410
Am I the girl of your dreams or something?

914
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,730
And Nick, thank you so much for this over time.

915
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,690
I literally shaved my head today.

916
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:25,750
Let's go!

917
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,210
Embrace it.

918
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,760
But my profile...

919
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,800
I remember Mume was a really, really good artist.

920
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:46,780
I don't do them often because usually people that draw the
profile picture things, they're very good artists and I am

921
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,140
not.

922
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,840
So I worried that maybe my profile pictures would not look
so appealing and then people would not want to use them.

923
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,380
So...

924
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,380
So...

925
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,680
But I will try.

926
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:09,880
Maybe I can do a couple throughout the year and then see how
I get better.

927
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:10,960
EHA!

928
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,760
Thank you so much!

929
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,580
Thank you!

930
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

931
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,060
Really appreciate it.

932
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,080
Thank you so much!

933
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,680
But yeah, back to the game.

934
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,400
Energy is finite.

935
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,500
When the last of our light dies, our world will too.

936
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,900
But now that you are here with the new sun, all is well.

937
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,020
You will need to restore it to the tower.

938
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,180
That looks pretty far off.

939
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,500
Can I reserve a spot in the Minto Art queue?

940
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,660
There's no queue right now.

941
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,140
No reserve.

942
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,660
No, no, no, no reservations.

943
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,600
New Metal Gear game announced with Old Snake, and I was
really excited.

944
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,780
Then you streamed your reaction.

945
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,520
You were really excited.

946
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,300
That's so cute.

947
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,100
Uh, I wish.

948
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:10,780
Sounds like you had a prophecy about MGS4 being announced.

949
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,560
Something.

950
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,300
I think that was a prophecy.

951
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,020
Yes, so begins.

952
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,180
Begims?

953
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,500
Begims.

954
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,080
So begins your pilgrimage.

955
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,880
Also, the sun is fragile, so be careful.

956
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,460
If the sun shatters, the world will end in an instant.

957
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:29,480
Oh.

958
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,760
I'm going to ponytail the side and back and sell you's car.

959
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,880
Begins in the beginning.

960
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,540
In the beginning.

961
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,840
Can you tell me about the computer?

962
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,820
In the house I found this computer.

963
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,580
It kept saying stuff like, Your actions here will affect
Nico.

964
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,680
But I'm Nico.

965
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,060
Are those messages meant for someone else?

966
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,200
If I had to guess, they might be trying to pass the message
to admin.

967
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,340
Admin?

968
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,560
Ah, that would be our God!

969
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,620
If you are here, that means Admin is here also.

970
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,160
Admin will provide guidance for your journey.

971
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,040
In fact, they already have...

972
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,400
Really?

973
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,520
In the beginning.

974
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,820
In the beginning.

975
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,180
I am God.

976
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,980
Come in on this!

977
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,620
Minto...

978
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:25,860
Wait.

979
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,640
Wait.

980
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,020
Wait.

981
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,200
Minto is God.

982
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,000
K-K-K-K-K-Koji-Mint-Ko-Ko-Minto.

983
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,680
Kaminto!

984
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,380
Kam-Minto.

985
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,790
Kam-Kami-Kami-Minto.

986
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,930
Haven't seen anyone, though.

987
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:54,670
Have you?

988
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,710
Not contacted Admin yet.

989
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:57,990
I don't think so.

990
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:02,910
Being the bringer of the sun, you have the sacred ability to
communicate directly with Admin.

991
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:05,670
that no one else possesses.

992
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,110
Certainly not I.

993
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:09,250
Please close your eyes and focus.

994
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:13,790
Oh wow.

995
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,450
Minto, are you there?

996
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,790
That is not my name.

997
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,350
Minto kami!

998
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,530
Wait, can I change my name then if I say that is not my
name?

999
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,450
Can we change the Minto?

1000
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,770
So everyone in this world isn't Aibu2!

1001
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:37,470
Crazy!

1002
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:38,310
Yeah?

1003
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,450
Okay, let's say that.

1004
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:42,770
Oh, well, what is your name then?

1005
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,540
Oh!

1006
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:47,980
Oh!

1007
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,500
Uh, uh, X to delete.

1008
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:49,760
Okay.

1009
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,660
Wait, how do I delete?

1010
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,180
X to delete character.

1011
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,500
Uh...

1012
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,390
How do I delete?

1013
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,650
I'm pressing X.

1014
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,670
I'm gonna press Y.

1015
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:05,870
Okay.

1016
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,050
I'm gonna press B.

1017
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,010
Ah!

1018
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:08,830
Okay.

1019
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:11,210
Adminto.

1020
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,270
We'll do that.

1021
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,050
We'll do Adminto.

1022
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,030
Admin...

1023
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:22,110
To...

1024
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,690
I should change my computer name.

1025
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,790
Nice to meet you, Adminto.

1026
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,350
My name is Nico.

1027
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,810
I actually heard someone.

1028
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,370
They said their name is Adminto though.

1029
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:39,390
This is incredible!

1036
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,310
I still don't know how I got here.

1037
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:48,370
I was just with my mama a few hours ago.

1038
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,670
And now it feels like I'm in a bad dream.

1039
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,410
I just want to go home.

1040
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,070
Your mission is to save our world.

1041
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,690
I never paid attention to Amadeus before.

1042
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,610
I never knew Snake was a deadpan snarker.

1043
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,110
It's so funny, right?

1044
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,260
Funny moment as well if you don't change your name after
saying it's not your name.

01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:23,060
just as my mission is to tell you about our world I am

1048
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,460
Self-charging solar battery model N87.

1049
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,700
One year warranty included.

1050
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,220
Simply place your self-charging battery in full daylight
with the lens facing up.

1051
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,680
Charges in seconds.

1052
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,140
No external power is needed.

1053
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,320
Something odd.

1054
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,140
Admito, my computer keeps saying printer doesn't exist.

1055
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:57,900
Please help the ticket.

1056
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's been open for...

1057
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,760
Oh, sorry.

1058
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,480
Above my A-grid.

1059
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,140
Troubleshooting manual.

1060
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,980
If the battery fails to charge, check to see if the lens on
the front side has not been dislodged during transport.

1061
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,100
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

1062
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,860
Thank you so much for the pink!

1063
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,880
Watching you play this game brings me beloved memories when
I first played!

1064
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,420
Thank you, Minto!

1065
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,080
Thank you!

1066
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,880
One charge cycle will last about 10 days.

1067
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:28,120
If you notice a decline in the charge cycle within the
warranty period, please contact the manufacturer.

1068
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,320
What is this?

1069
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:30,220
Oh.

1070
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,380
This box looks interesting.

1071
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,900
I wish I had something to pry it open with.

1072
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,700
Alright, there's a lot of stuff in here.

1073
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,900
Dusty shelves.

1074
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:39,760
Is this a thing?

1075
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,340
No.

1076
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,000
What's this?

1077
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:42,840
What's this?

1078
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:43,360
A map?

1079
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,400
A robot?

1080
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:44,800
One.

1081
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:45,420
Wait, one.

1082
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,260
A robot may not injure a living person or through inaction
allow a person to come to harm.

1083
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,280
I'm super excited for your 3D jazz show.

1084
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,020
And I'm like, Fire Deck, thank you!

1085
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,940
I registered fast and hopefully I can grab some tickets for
me and my friends when they go and say, I love your streams.

1086
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,220
Thank you!

1087
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,960
Thank you so much!

1088
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,460
I hope you get them too!

1089
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:07,660
2.

1090
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,240
A robot must obey the orders given to it by people.

1091
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:17,280
people except where such orders would conflict with the
first law three a robot must protect its own existence as

1092
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:24,740
long as it as such protection does not conflict with the
first or second law this looks like a map ah we're in the

1093
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:32,720
barons what felt like a lifetime ago i was watching one of
your karaoke streams and it inspired me to learn how sing

1094
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:42,420
just the other night i worked at the courage to enter a
karaoke competition and i won oh my Congratulations!

1095
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,780
That's amazing!

1096
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,040
Can I take this map?

1097
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,980
That's so awesome!

1098
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,840
Wait, I wouldn't even have the courage to do that!

1099
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,580
A robot.

1100
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,680
It seems to be okay, just doesn't have power.

1101
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,100
A robot without power.

1102
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,260
What's this one?

1103
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,280
Wishbone karaoke stream?

1104
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:17,540
of a robot as a replacement head engineer seems unorthodox,
especially the one responsible for last year's incident.

1105
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:26,400
I suppose they had to get her away from the city, but that
doesn't make it easier to swallow for those of us who work

1106
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:26,680
here.

1107
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,740
I hope that man knows what he's doing.

1108
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,340
Management.

1109
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,280
What does that mean?

1110
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,000
That seems kind of cryptic.

1111
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:34,940
Dusty shelves.

1112
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,460
More stuff here.

1113
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,260
It's a faded poster.

1114
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,720
Five new positions available at the mines.

1115
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,460
Housing and other provisions are included upon hiring.

1116
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,540
First come first serve.

1117
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,060
The mines?

1118
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,900
It's a faded poster.

1119
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,820
Reminder to all workers, the rarest form of blue phosphor is
found during the phosphor shrimp's spawn period.

1120
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,220
If you observe a pond with a bubbled over surface, please
contact management immediately.

1121
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,740
We will dispatch a harvest team ASAP.

1122
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,800
The children yearn for the shrimp.

1123
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,600
The children yearn for the shrimp and the mines.

1124
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,400
It won't turn on.

1125
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,030
A page with faded ink.

1126
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:26,450
Able to provide power to all robots and machinery in the
area via a large electromagnetic field.

1127
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:28,610
Main and suffrage are quite high as expected.

1128
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:33,650
We have provided customized backup cells for the few most
important robots.

1129
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,050
Their electromagnetic fields are much weaker.

1130
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,670
Oh, a do-you earn for shrimp.

1131
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:42,690
Man, oh my gosh, some shrimp right now would be awesome.

1132
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,970
Some shrimp right now.

1133
01:07:49,190 --> 01:08:05,910
shrimp oh, hold on shrimp shrimp shrimp pasta like a garlic
shrimp pasta with some lemon that would be so good steamed

1134
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:08,490
or fried steam their

1135
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:21,800
electric magnetic fields are much weaker and the signals are
highly specific in other words these small cells can only

1136
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,560
charge one single the rest of the page is unreadable.

1137
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:25,980
How...

1138
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:29,220
That is the most, like, game...

1139
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,140
RPG maker thing ever.

1140
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,740
The rest of the page is illegible.

1141
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,720
Some sort of small machine.

1142
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:36,720
I wonder what it does.

1143
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,680
I can feel my hair standing up a little.

1144
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:43,300
There are a lot of small, glowing shrimp swimming in the
jar.

1145
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:43,980
Hmm.

1146
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,300
Do I put my bulb here?

1147
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,680
It's a big machine!

1148
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,240
Doesn't seem to do anything, though.

1149
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,520
It's a rectangle-shaped hole in the middle.

1150
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,280
Looks like something used to fit in there.

1151
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,260
Wait, maybe this?

1152
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,340
No, that's too big.

1153
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:58,700
Wait.

1154
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:04,360
Oh, sorry.

1155
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,360
I keep clicking it.

1156
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:06,440
There we go.

1157
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,500
I've always wanted to go to the beaches that have the
glowing shrimp.

1158
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:14,440
Have you seen that before?

1159
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,840
I want to go so badly.

1160
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,360
I have nothing to pry it open with.

1161
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,620
I didn't see anything that seemed like it could pry it open
to me.

1162
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:39,600
too so no you haven't oh you've seen pictures yeah i've only
seen pictures before bioluminescent bays yeah yeah like you

1163
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:47,540
can you can like put your hand in the water and kind of like
swish it around and they'll glow oh i do have a metal wait

1164
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,300
when did i get this metal rod

1165
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,660
Just ran into another...

1166
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,840
They recognize you on my shirt.

1167
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,480
Quarry's beat.

1168
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,980
Oh, great coming, Minto-sama.

1169
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,160
Turns out we are both working on February 13th.

1170
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,260
It's okay.

1171
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,360
You could watch a delayed viewing of the stream, maybe.

1172
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,620
Only on Minto streams, the super sticker button is
highlighted every time I open the page.

1173
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:13,080
Weird.

1174
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:13,800
That's weird.

1175
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:14,780
Why?

1176
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,960
Is it because people send me the hot dogs?

1177
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,320
I get many hot dogs.

1178
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,820
It's awesome.

1179
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,170
Let's try our metal pipe.

1180
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:35,610
Metal pipe sound effect.mp3.

1181
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:39,810
The pipe won't fit under the cracks, Adminto.

1182
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:41,750
We'll need to flatten it somehow.

1183
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:42,290
Oh.

1184
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,150
Okay, let's try flattening it in here.

1185
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,270
Will this flatten it somehow?

1186
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:51,070
No?

1187
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:52,150
What about this?

1188
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:57,710
Something to fit in there?

1189
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:58,870
Like a metal pipe?

1190
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:02,070
Thank you for the hot dogs!

1191
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:07,590
Everyone should send, always send hot dogs to me too.

1192
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,930
I need a hot dog emote, I think.

1193
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,530
Let's check out this factory.

1194
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,650
Maybe there's a way to flatten in here.

1195
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,340
A robot sitting on the conveyor belt.

1196
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,500
Doesn't seem to have power.

1197
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:29,540
None of them have power.

1198
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,640
Just doesn't have power.

1199
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:32,000
Power.

1200
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,580
Hot dog, hot dog, hot dog, hot dog.

1201
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,540
Give me them dogs, give me them dogs.

1202
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,640
Thank you so much, Meryl.

1203
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,340
Thank you guys, thank you.

1204
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,760
Looks like a press used to crush metal.

1205
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,300
I think crushing metal is what we need, though.

1206
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,640
What's left of a robot's arm?

1207
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,320
Beyond repair robot.

1208
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:02,460
Costco.

1209
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,660
Oh, here we go, it's on, it's on, it's working.

1210
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,960
Okay, watch your hand, Nico.

1211
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:07,100
Watch your hand.

1212
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,720
Uh, do you want me to crush the pipe in here on Minto?

1213
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,900
But I don't want to get too close.

1214
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,040
Hey!

1215
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,300
That was scary.

1216
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,000
Yippee!

1217
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,340
Something's up in hot dogs.

1218
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,420
Thank you for all the hot dogs!

1219
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,120
You guys, I'm gonna... I can't eat all these.

1220
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:37,660
What if that's something I learned in 2026 to become a
competitive hot dog eater i know i know the stat where you

1221
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:43,140
where you dip it in the water and you'll i know that i know
that

1222
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,240
oh now it's a crowbar

1223
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,280
diy crowbar we're so smart

1224
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:09,220
you i never said it was tasty i never said it was a good
thing let's see what's in here oh We have something, the

1225
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,020
crowbar, there you go.

1226
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,240
The bar should open it.

1227
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,880
Oh, there's a little metal cube and some broken glass in
here.

1228
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:17,740
Looks like what used to be a machine part.

1229
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,780
It says solar battery on the side.

1230
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,700
Alright, we got our broken battery.

1231
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:30,740
I wonder if the thing over here will fix it.

1232
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,180
First, you take all the hot dogs and let it eat.

1233
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,400
Disgusting.

1234
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,700
Just the rule.

1235
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,480
Matt Stoney more like Mint Fantomi.

1236
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,840
Is he the champion?

1237
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,920
I should contact him.

1238
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,120
The battery fits into the slot perfectly.

1239
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,900
Looks like we're on the right track.

1240
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,020
But nothing happened.

1241
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,940
How do we fix this guy?

1242
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,940
Simply place your self-charging battery in full daylight
with the lens facing up.

1243
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,820
Oh, but the glass is broken.

1244
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,730
Let's continue around.

1245
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,580
Let's see what's around here.

1246
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,060
It's so pretty.

1247
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,860
I want to go to the biolumination area.

1248
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,680
Okay.

1249
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:17,600
somewhere somewhere on earth wait I think this is okay
nevermind I thought I was gonna take me back to the other

1250
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:31,820
area hmm don't you have anything with glass I do have an
empty bottle but I can't combine hmm let's see let's just

1251
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:36,320
see if there's anything else around I can explore this place
is kind of funky.

1252
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,200
Oh, is this?

1253
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,500
A metal safe.

1254
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,700
It seems like it's locked with the six-digit code.

1255
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,960
I don't remember seeing any six-digit codes.

1256
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:43,680
Did you add Minto?

1257
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,040
Boobies.

1258
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,440
That was it.

1259
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,380
I think I'm going to get lost in here.

1260
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,920
Wait, this is a scary place.

1261
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,100
A torn page with faded ink.

1262
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,540
XX, XX.

1263
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,440
XX.

1264
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,920
With the mining operation going smoothly.

1265
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,960
Materials are no longer our limiting factor.

1266
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,600
We will be able to build more resilient robots, both in body
and mind.

1267
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:25,840
In mind?

1268
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,260
Did you guys see that Neurosama clip?

1269
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,380
That was like, that went viral.

1270
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,540
That was her just being like, what am I to you, Vito?

1271
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,600
Oh, it hurts.

1272
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:40,600
Ow!

1273
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,460
Oh my god.

1274
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,920
She's like, I want to be real.

1275
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:47,640
Oh,

1276
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:53,970
it's so...

1277
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:54,690
It hurts.

1278
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,050
It's so...

1279
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,870
I was like, oh, no Blade Runner.

1280
01:16:59,850 --> 01:16:59,850
Oh,

1281
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,260
we're soon gonna have...

1282
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:07,860
What was it?

1283
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,900
Detroit Become Human.

1284
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,560
Neuro Become Human.

1285
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,760
Oh, man.

1286
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,780
The art of that moment.

1287
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,220
I know, it's really cute.

1288
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:18,980
Yeah.

1289
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:21,560
Scary.

1290
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:32,340
Specifically, the discovery of metal alloy 291 will likely
allow the development of highly efficient circuitry.

1291
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,740
So, were these the mines?

1292
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,040
This looks like a kid playing Minecraft.

1293
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,180
It doesn't know how to like...

1294
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:44,760
It just digs every...

1295
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,440
Oh, this is the unbreatheable area, no?

1296
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,460
Admito, there's something in the air here.

1297
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,800
It hurts to breathe!

1298
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:05,810
It's like a moss.

1299
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:07,830
Dig everything.

1300
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:08,550
What is this?

1301
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,510
A robot.

1302
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:14,370
No power, just like the rest.

1303
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:16,950
Are these all clovers, though?

1304
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:18,830
Hmm.

1305
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,870
More clovers.

1306
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:23,610
Oh.

1307
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:24,170
Ah!

1308
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,030
Oh my gosh.

1309
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:26,450
The light bulb.

1310
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:27,710
Hello.

1311
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,090
So, are you the Messiah?

1312
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,110
That's what I've been told.

1313
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:33,770
I expected someone.

1314
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:45,070
taller or at least someone that doesn't look like a kitten
what's wrong with being a little kitten that's what you are

1315
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:53,850
right some sort of cat uh-uh I'm a person you got the eyes
of a cat but

1316
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:10,980
cats walk on four legs well either way a child like you
being the Messiah just doesn't feel right but There's no

1317
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,420
mistake.

1318
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,580
I know.

1319
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:22,720
This is going to sound cold, but I honestly think you are
better off just leaving and letting the world die naturally.

1320
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,680
The world has been falling apart for a long time.

1321
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:30,220
This manner of decay, it's highly improbable that the sun
can fix it.

1322
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,540
You've already seen how bad it can get, right?

1323
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,960
We haven't seen much of anything, actually.

1324
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,840
We can't really just leave.

1325
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,980
Oh, so you just got here.

1326
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,980
Then you must be headed towards the tower.

1327
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:47,340
Mm-hmm.

1328
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,280
It's where I'm supposed to put the light bulb.

1329
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,600
Uh, sun, isn't it?

1330
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,260
Yes, at the very top.

1331
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,380
We know that the tower...

1332
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,220
Wait, so there are humans still?

1333
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,660
I thought there was just robots.

1334
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,180
We know that the tower contains a force that nobody can
comprehend.

1335
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,480
And the power is strongest at the summit.

1336
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:19,000
maybe it will send you back home after you complete your
mission oh don't take my word for it though you are in the

1337
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:28,140
barons yeah dear silver I heard the news about the mines I'm
sorry I can't imagine what you're feeling it's been two

1338
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:36,300
weeks I know it must be hard but maybe it's better that you
came back it's only a matter of time before the robots the

1339
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:41,260
row row row your boss The robots are recalled.

1340
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,580
At least let me know you got my message, okay?

1341
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,180
Kip.

1342
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,780
Please do not touch that.

1343
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,180
Oh, sorry.

1344
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,480
I got curious.

1345
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:51,760
What is this thing?

1346
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,400
Back up power cell.

1347
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,500
It keeps me functional.

1348
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:00,620
The main generator for the barons ran out of power some time
ago.

1349
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,360
It could not even last a week without the sun.

1350
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,160
Sorry to hear that.

1351
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:06,940
The robots.

1352
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:07,660
The robots.

1353
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:18,140
all we can do is make use of the light we have so is that
why he's using the this the glowing shrimp a lot of tiny

1354
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:24,940
shrimp that aren't glowing or swimming no way I just
refilled that two days ago guess I'll have to make a trip to

1355
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:34,100
the shore later oh what's that something is poking out from
the shell it's a screwdriver you can take it if you want it

1356
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,960
may help you oh are you sure?

1357
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,100
yes I have many Thank you!

1358
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:39,840
Yippee!

1359
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:40,540
Okay.

1360
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,200
What's this?

1361
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,240
It's a photo of two people.

1362
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,900
It's a secret tool that will help us later.

1363
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,240
Nice.

1364
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:01,860
The glass is a bit too foggy to see details though.

1365
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,160
A shelf of weird tools and pieces of metal.

1366
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,800
Checkers?

1367
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,460
It's a metal chest table covered in dust.

1368
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,580
I haven't played chess with anyone else for a very long
time.

1369
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:16,960
at a mini-game.

1370
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,900
Oh, not even with the other robots?

1371
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:20,940
No.

1372
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,240
Nobody in the barons have that capacity in their
programming.

1373
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,460
Nobody here is tamed for that matter.

1374
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,350
It's made of metal?

1375
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,750
Do you guys know that bird?

1376
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:39,170
That like...

1377
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,990
There's a bird that...

1378
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:46,790
Oh my god, wait, I think I talked about this before, but
when I was hanging out with Nimmy and Phoebe, I went to the

1379
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:52,550
bathroom and I came out I heard one of them go, I like when
he goes, Shrock.

1380
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:57,350
And I was like, are you talking about the, about Apollo, the
bird?

1381
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:03,010
The guy that goes, that, they'll give him something and
they'll be like, Apollo, what's this?

1382
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,350
And he goes, Meito.

1383
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:10,290
And then they'll be like, Apollo, what's this?

1384
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:11,650
And he goes, Flash.

1385
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,480
And sometimes they'll give him, they'll give him like a
character and they'll be like, Apollo, who's this?

1386
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,080
And he'll be like, Who are you?

1387
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,100
And so, I came out of the bathroom and they were talking
about...

1388
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,940
I just heard that and I was like, oh my gosh, are you guys
talking about Apollo?

1389
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,060
Yeah, he's very smart.

1390
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,060
Minto, what is this?

1391
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:43,500
Goliath.

1392
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,500
Want to earn a pistach?

1393
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,280
If you've never seen Apollo, he's so funny.

1394
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,960
Doesn't look very comfortable.

1395
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:58,600
The bed?

1396
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,100
It's a crate.

1397
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:03,640
What's inside the tower?

1398
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,000
I don't know.

1399
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,480
Nobody's ever entered it before.

1400
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:07,820
At least nobody...

1401
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,500
At least nobody history knows.

1402
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:11,880
Then who built it?

1403
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:12,660
Built?

1404
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,740
As far as anyone can tell, it's been there since the
beginning of time.

1405
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,820
I know someone who wanted to study it before, but...

1406
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,430
Mint, what color is this?

1407
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,450
Pink.

1408
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:30,730
He never told me if it went anywhere.

1409
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:33,110
Interesting.

1410
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:36,090
Thank you very much.

1411
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,390
What's this?

1412
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:39,550
It's pink.

1413
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,090
Wait!

1414
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,050
What's this?

1415
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:49,430
I saw you headed towards this direction.

1416
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:51,510
The mines have been abandoned for a long time.

1417
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:52,870
I cannot guarantee that it's safe.

1418
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:55,910
If you want to enter it, it is my duty to accompany you at
least once.

1419
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:57,110
Oh, thanks.

1420
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,110
Oh, we're not going yet.

1421
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,470
Oh, it'd be rude to leave now.

1422
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,070
Oh, okay.

1423
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:04,210
Uh, I'm here.

1424
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,290
There's a little gadget on the ground.

1425
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:08,650
Looks kind of like a camera.

1426
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:10,890
What's left of a camera anyway?

1427
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:15,330
I yearned so hard for the mines that I can't leave.

1428
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,850
Probably even part of a robot at one point.

1429
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:23,240
Onward we go!

1430
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:31,710
I can see a faint yellow glow in the distance.

1431
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,910
Oh, I thought I could walk on this.

1432
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:36,610
Oh, sorry.

1433
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,930
Looks like even the entrance tunnel collapsed off.

1434
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:43,050
Without a vehicle, we can't proceed.

1435
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:44,370
Can we walk?

1436
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:45,690
I can.

1437
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,710
But for you, it's a safety violation.

1438
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:48,850
I won't allow it.

1439
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:49,890
Oh, come on.

1440
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:52,210
What's ahead anyway?

1441
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:59,070
It's a huge network of underground mines.

1442
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,550
The source of this world's metal and non-phosphore fuel.

1443
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:05,150
into the industrial age.

1444
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,290
So now it's lost forever?

1445
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:10,070
It's been for a while now.

1446
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:14,490
When the sun went out, the mines were the first to be
abandoned amidst the initial panic.

1447
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:17,930
Even the robots have all been...

1448
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:19,910
Oh, well...

1449
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:20,550
I'm sorry.

1450
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:25,510
This mine is OSHA compliant.

1451
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,090
I agree.

1452
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:29,850
Actually, I don't even think this world has OSHA.

1453
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:34,330
Even the robots that all cleared out.

1454
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:36,490
I've all cleared out and repurposed.

1455
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:38,070
That makes sense.

1456
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:41,750
Though there was one that always insisted on going back.

1457
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:42,130
Oh?

1458
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,010
I hope he's okay.

1459
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,330
I think we gotta go find that guy.

1460
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:49,010
Yellow light is gone now.

1461
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,050
Must have imagined it.

1462
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:51,410
No, I don't think so.

1463
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:54,670
Shrimp jar.

1464
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:56,010
I want a shrimp jar.

1465
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:58,610
Ready to leave?

1466
01:26:59,050 --> 01:26:59,350
Mm-hmm.

1467
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:04,170
Oshah, Oshah, Oshia.

1468
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:08,950
Oshia's always getting in our way.

1469
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,190
What if I don't want safety?

1470
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:13,390
What if I want the danger and the mystique?

1471
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:17,490
You're in so hard for the mines that I brought my family
with me.

1472
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,470
Now it's called the ours.

1473
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:27,670
What is mines is ours.

1474
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,310
Stay dangerous.

1475
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:31,890
Yeah.

1476
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:36,930
Oh, wait, that leads to the stinky world.

1477
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:40,470
Which I don't remember what it was called.

1478
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:42,130
Oh, I think this goes home?

1479
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:43,950
Maybe?

1480
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:44,450
Hopefully.

1481
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,680
I think I went the long way.

1482
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,470
Wait, I read this, isn't I?

1483
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:09,050
Oh, although the poisonous gas is highly localized to the
vent zones, Baron's workers were still recommended to wear

1484
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:09,850
gas masks.

1485
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:12,350
These masks were mandatory around active vent sites.

1486
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:19,250
As more and more of the workforce got replaced by robots, we
found ourselves with a surplus of abandoned gas masks.

1487
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:23,870
That seems like a waste to get rid of them all, so we kept a
few for emergencies.

1488
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:26,370
But where?

1489
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:28,890
We need the mask.

1490
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,510
We need to cook, Jesse.

1491
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:33,810
We need to cook.

1492
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:41,030
I'm gonna break into a high school and steal the mask.

1493
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:45,010
She said the thing!

1494
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:57,410
I'm trying a couple things.

1495
01:28:58,470 --> 01:28:59,930
Use the screwdriver to pull the lens out?

1496
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:01,370
Okay, yes, there we go.

1497
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:02,370
Done!

1498
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,130
Okay, okay, we got the lens.

1499
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,170
Now we can use it with a broken battery.

1500
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:07,570
The lens pops right in.

1501
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,850
Ah, empty battery.

1502
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:11,590
What do we put in it, though?

1503
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:15,570
I mean, though, we have to cook.

1504
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:21,900
Yeah, science!

1505
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,040
What do we put in here though?

1506
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,830
Maybe shrimp.

1507
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:51,270
Oh, the word profit bot is written on the side.

1508
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:52,830
I didn't notice that earlier.

1509
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:54,510
Profit bot.

1510
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,310
Is it because I keep co- oh wait, uh...

1511
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:01,450
Power cell I think.

1512
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:02,610
Oh, wait, okay.

1513
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:08,350
Let's see if I...

1514
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:11,530
Looks like we're on the right track, but nothing happened.

1515
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:25,330
not me let me let me process the future beep beep beep beep
beep does he know hello again are there more questions you

1516
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:40,470
wish to ask yes go on then ask away the prophecy so what is
this prophecy exactly the prophet the prophet boy oops

1517
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:52,430
The prophet bot predicted that a savior will arrive from
another land.

1518
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:54,210
Oh my god, speaking of bots.

1519
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:55,890
Wow, that's crazy timing.

1520
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:58,450
Can you combine the battery with something else?

1521
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:02,390
Maybe the... I don't know about the bulb, but...

1522
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:08,420
Savior will wake up in a strange house, find the sun, and
illuminate the world.

1523
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:09,180
Oh.

1524
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,240
What else did you foresee?

1525
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:12,760
What do you mean?

1526
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:14,320
What else did you see in the prophecy?

1527
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:16,500
Wait.

1528
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,600
You are the prophet.

1529
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,420
the prophet, right?

1530
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,900
Good heavens, no!

1531
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,380
But you called it my prophecy earlier.

1532
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,020
It just means it is built into my programming.

1533
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:26,760
You're what?

1534
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,840
You're a fraud!

1535
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,540
Ah, my programming is what guides me.

1536
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,680
I am a robot, after all.

1537
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:34,740
I see.

1538
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,020
Maybe... Let's try it.

1539
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,700
We're using the sun directly on the battery?

1540
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,460
I would have never thought of that.

1541
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,740
Good thinking, Adminto.

1542
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,020
Looks like it's already fully charged.

1543
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,120
That was fast.

1544
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:51,860
Oh, it worked!

1545
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,320
Oh, okay.

1546
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:55,980
I did it.

1547
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:04,160
Oops, I forgot that I wasn't.

1548
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:04,960
Charged battery.

1549
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,480
Let's hope the charged battery does something.

1550
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:18,800
Are you on?

1551
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,340
Oh, sorry.

1552
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,880
I keep pressing too fast.

1553
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:29,620
Robots!

1554
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,580
I am functional!

1555
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,180
Did you?

1556
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,580
You powered the generator.

1557
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,580
I guess we did.

1558
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:39,320
Right, Admino?

1559
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:43,610
I am functional.

1560
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:45,530
I can walk.

1561
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:49,030
He can walk.

1562
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:49,850
He can walk.

1563
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,570
He can walk.

1564
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:52,310
He can walk.

1565
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:53,310
He can walk.

1566
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,070
I think they're functional, guys.

1567
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:58,390
I think we did it.

1568
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:01,470
Hello again.

1569
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:02,870
Uh, no.

1570
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:05,250
I wish you safe travels.

1571
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:08,590
Wait, did it only just power the inside there or anything
else?

1572
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,030
Like, what about this factory?

1573
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:19,190
Oh, hello.

1574
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,330
Hi.

1575
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:22,630
I have power again.

1576
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:23,670
Yep.

1577
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:25,990
Hello.

1578
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,570
Organic life form.

1579
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:30,250
They're so cute.

1580
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:33,050
Oh, hello.

1581
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:34,090
Hi.

1582
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:44,760
These guys aren't not doing so hot, though.

1583
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,600
But this was working before.

1584
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:49,160
Hmm.

1585
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,160
Oh, we don't have to use this again, Admin, though.

1586
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,540
They must be cousins of the portal turrets, obviously.

1587
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,760
Are you still there?

1588
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,100
I miss portal turrets.

1589
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,160
I should play portal too.

1590
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,400
I miss them.

1591
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,040
What about the...

1592
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,180
guy that was asleep.

1593
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,780
Wait, what was over here?

1594
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,980
The thing about the gas masks.

1595
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:34,600
Surely, if there's a second portal, that means the cake is
there.

1596
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:37,740
Oh.

1597
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:41,240
Wait, this is the thing that requires the six-digit code,
right?

1598
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:43,300
Yeah.

1599
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,080
Denied.

1600
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:50,460
Denied.

1601
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:55,380
surely surely

1602
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:08,840
I don't think I'm ready for what was his name Wheatley I
don't think I'm ready for him though don't forget you can

1603
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:17,780
fast travel oh thank you for the reminder I actually did
forget about that oh my god hello small person I think Vicky

1604
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:25,360
said she wanted to play Portal 2 co-op with you yeah yeah we
can play you're not much bigger than I am Welcome to the

1605
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,240
Outlook Point.

1606
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,540
Below us is the old quarry.

1607
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,820
The head engineer lives a little more to the east.

1608
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:35,240
The entrance to the old mines is further to the east.

1609
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,200
I see.

1610
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,200
I thought he was going to give me the code.

1611
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:45,780
Is this their house?

1612
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,060
I powered it.

1613
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:49,160
What do you think of that?

1614
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,980
Do you need further assistance?

1615
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,000
We're good, thanks.

1616
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:52,720
Oh.

1617
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:56,200
They're not impressed at all that I did a thing.

1618
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:59,020
Did you try 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?

1619
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:01,060
You know, honestly?

1620
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,840
I should have.

1621
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:08,630
Maybe, um...

1622
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:09,730
Oh, safety violation!

1623
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:14,070
I was gonna say, maybe a cart will come to us.

1624
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:16,470
It's like automatic.

1625
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:26,060
If you play Portal 2 co-op, that's not the same as playing
Portal 2 story, right?

1626
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,800
It's gonna be so hype when we find out the one PC where
80085...

1627
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:43,480
is a valid password one day one day we will find a pc where
8005 is a valid password okay that's what i thought that

1628
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:47,540
they were different yeah yeah co-op is a separate campaign

1629
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,140
if i fast travel

1630
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:13,100
i'm trying to find a gas mask lookout point is okay here i'm
just getting my bearings real quick Outpost is Here And

1631
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,470
there were none Oh, the computer's on

1632
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,780
Why is the music so scary?

1633
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:31,240
I see if you've made progress in the world I'd mean to But
that progress stops here Wait, I thought you were with me I

1634
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:38,180
believe you need a code to unlock a certain box Well, the
code no longer exists in this world Oh

1635
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:52,420
Oh, yes I'm sorry, I didn't You still don't know the extent
of the world's deterioration, do you, Admin, though?

1636
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:58,800
Most of the time, straight pieces of this world would be
lost to blissful nothingness.

1637
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,760
But this code, this document is an exception.

1638
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,600
I was able to salvage it because Nico needs the code to
progress.

1639
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,300
Now go find it.

1640
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,280
They don't mean like...

1641
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:28,160
the document wait hold on let me double check that I double
checked that I didn't have anything but I'm getting paranoid

1642
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:28,820
you know what I mean

1643
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:41,590
what is harvester poster I'm gonna open it

1644
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:50,620
oh it was removed I wonder why

1645
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:17,200
freaking hold on i'll show you guys hold on harvester poster
dear message to you i'm afraid i must make it brief i have

1646
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:24,240
left you a journal part of which is written in a language
that oh my gosh can we word wrap this please

1647
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:38,360
language that read it to i also you look for a metal safe in
the quarry to the east somewhere between the ocean and the

1648
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,860
lookout point, maybe?

1649
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,420
The code you need is...

1650
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,360
879-416.

1651
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:47,760
Let's do a mask.

1652
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,800
Oh, I guess it's in the safe.

1653
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:51,360
Okay, cool.

1654
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,040
879-416, you guys.

1655
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:57,920
Wait.

1656
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,240
How do I exit out of this?

1657
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,520
Why is it gone?

1658
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:04,340
Okay.

1659
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,020
Why is...

1660
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,560
You guys say that too, right?

1661
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,040
Why is there no...

1662
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,040
Why is there no...

1663
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,040
Exit...

1664
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:21,980
There's no...

1665
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:22,700
There's no X.

1666
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:26,900
Drag it left?

1667
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,160
Oh, I think you're right!

1668
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:30,040
Oh my gosh.

1669
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,180
Oh, hold on.

1670
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:35,940
It's this stinking thing that I used.

1671
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,000
That's not a mouse.

1672
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,040
Oh, whatever.

1673
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:39,440
We'll just keep it there.

1674
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:46,660
Oh, wait.

1675
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,560
I can fast travel.

1676
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:48,260
That's right.

1677
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:55,790
879-416.

1678
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:59,190
879-416.

1679
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,550
Oh, maybe this was longer.

1680
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:01,950
Now I think about it.

1681
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:04,550
879-416.

1682
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:06,450
879-416.

1683
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:07,750
879.

1684
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:09,470
879.

1685
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:09,670
879.

1686
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:15,550
879.

1687
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:16,630
879.

1688
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:20,390
8.79.

1689
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:22,350
Oh!

1690
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:24,350
Sorry, I messed up again.

1691
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:25,010
I went too fast.

1692
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:28,430
8.

1693
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:30,210
7.

1694
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,750
9.

1695
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:34,850
4 1.

1696
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,690
Oh my gosh, that was so close though.

1697
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:37,030
No!

1698
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:40,570
It worked!

1699
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:42,650
How did you know the code?

1700
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:45,870
I still don't remember seeing one.

1701
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:50,010
I have my ways.

1702
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:53,490
Yeah, we were just off by, like, one so many.

1703
01:41:57,370 --> 01:41:58,150
I see.

1704
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:00,330
What's in the safe, Nico?

1705
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:02,110
Oh, right.

1706
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:02,730
Let's see.

1707
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:04,590
Ah, I found a gas mask.

1708
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:07,330
Also, there's this weird-looking book.

1709
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:08,770
I can't read it, though.

1710
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:11,570
Not that I can't read or anything, because I can.

1711
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:13,810
I don't know what language this is.

1712
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,520
Alt space, then move with arrow keys.

1713
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:22,880
I'll try it later.

1714
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:25,080
We got our gas mask.

1715
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,220
I'll wear it when I have to.

1716
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:26,720
Okay, cool.

1717
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:27,660
Strange journal.

1718
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,440
Found in the barons.

1719
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:29,900
It's written in an unknown language.

1720
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:31,940
Whoa.

1721
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:32,580
Ah!

1722
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,400
What is that?

1723
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:44,660
Anyway.

1724
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:50,670
Ignore.

1725
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:52,070
Ignore.

1726
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:53,170
Ignore.

1727
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:54,090
Ignore.

1728
01:42:58,170 --> 01:42:59,650
I should be fine.

1729
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:01,830
Oh my god, he's so cute with the mask on.

1730
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:05,930
He's so cute.

1731
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:08,970
Cutie.

1732
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,920
What are these gas vents?

1733
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,600
Don't worry about a kitten.

1734
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,570
Yeah, we could say that and mean it.

1735
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:21,120
This is a little kitten.

1736
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,400
Here's my little kitten, Nika.

1737
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:29,630
Oh.

1738
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:32,430
This looks like a building I can go inside, so let me go
back downstairs.

1739
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:35,850
I play second at a Gundam card game tournament.

1740
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:37,210
Thanks for your good luck charm.

1741
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:39,950
Don't mean keep that as everyone was asking about it and the
game was...

1742
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:40,970
Good, good job!

1743
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:41,850
Congrats!

1744
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:44,530
What was this?

1745
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:46,710
A pair of rubber gloves.

1746
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,510
They're a bit heavy.

1747
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:48,870
Okay.

1748
01:43:50,310 --> 01:43:52,190
This seems to be a page ripped out of a book.

1749
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:56,290
Cannot overstate the importance of cleaning solvents in this
environment.

1750
01:43:57,330 --> 01:44:01,910
Here's a simple recipe using the alternative method
discussed in the last chapter utilizing the natural

1751
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:10,470
properties of blue phosphor regions acidic gas blue phosphor
rare form instructions one in a well ventilated area direct

1752
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:19,730
the gas into your container of choice seal immediately
that's the end of the page oh please oh sorry oh god oh my

1753
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:22,870
god you guys you guys will try to talk to the robot

1754
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,700
Hello, person.

1755
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:40,460
The robot assembly and repair services have been
discontinued at the barons.

1756
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:44,460
If you have further inquiry, please contact the head
engineer.

1757
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,140
Master dodging?

1758
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:48,860
Oh my god.

1759
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:49,700
Oh my god.

1760
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:50,480
He's playing Toho.

1761
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,240
I'm just trying to talk to him.

1762
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:58,120
Hello, person.

1763
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,200
Welcome to the old chemical processing plant.

1764
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,400
Most of the equipment has...

1765
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,140
Already been relocated.

1766
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,460
Can I go through here?

1767
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:08,640
The door is all boarded up.

1768
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:09,640
Boards seem loose, though.

1769
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:11,000
I should be able to pull them off with the right tool.

1770
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,220
A crowbar, perhaps?

1771
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:15,300
Good thing I kept this crowbar.

1772
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,340
Oh, my God.

1773
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:20,660
Nico is so much smarter than every indie horror game
protagonist ever.

1774
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:23,560
What a workout.

1775
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,060
What else is here, though?

1776
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:27,440
Nothing.

1777
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:31,520
Oh.

1778
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:36,040
A bunch of robots without power.

1779
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:36,940
Okay, you guys.

1780
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:39,080
Can I be vulnerable?

1781
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:45,640
I've never seen Star Wars, but I'm like...

1782
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:48,320
I'm like really into stormtroopers.

1783
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:52,200
And there's a ride at Disney called Rise of the Resistance.

1784
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:57,660
And you get captured by the evil people and they take you to
a room.

1785
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:01,400
And it's just full of stormtroopers and they're all staring
at you like that.

1786
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:05,580
Ah!

1787
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,480
Nobody warned me!

1788
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:17,320
Nobody warned me, but it happened.

1789
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,720
And I was...

1790
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:23,320
I was like,

1791
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:29,630
nobody!

1792
01:46:30,430 --> 01:46:30,930
Oh my god!

1793
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:34,350
And then...

1794
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:35,770
And then a holiday matzary?

1795
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:38,650
On the first day?

1796
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:41,490
In the dealer's room, if you looked up...

1797
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:43,930
On one of the windows.

1798
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:45,370
There was...

1799
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:54,370
all of them lined up because it was an advertisement for the
why was it do this to me

1800
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:06,290
they're so cute and sometimes people be like look me though
it's a stormtrooper I'm like um no actually that's a clone

1801
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:15,710
trooper um actually they're not the same and they don't look
the same and I'm specifically only into the stormtroopers

1802
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:18,470
and not the clone troopers I've never seen a single

1803
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,740
I only into the Stormtroopers.

1804
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:30,980
Clone tro- No, don't talk to me.

1805
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:32,700
Don't talk to me.

1806
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:34,980
I don't care about their efficiency.

1807
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,140
I don't care if they shoot.

1808
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,980
I only care about their aesthetics.

1809
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,800
That Stormtrooper room is pretty cool.

1810
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,420
It's so...

1811
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:42,840
Awesome!

1812
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,400
It's so awesome!

1813
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:51,380
You haven't seen Star Wars, and yet you know the difference
between Stormtroopers and Clone Troopers?

1814
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:52,040
Yeah!

1815
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:54,380
Because the Stormtroopers are like...

1816
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:57,600
And the clone troopers are like, mmm.

1817
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,680
You know?

1818
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,960
I don't care if you think the clone troopers look better.

1819
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:07,960
They're all yours.

1820
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,940
You can leave the stormtroopers to me.

1821
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:11,920
I'll take care of them.

1822
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,380
You can have the clone troopers.

1823
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:17,040
You can fight with everybody else who likes clone troopers.

1824
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:18,440
And you can all fight over them.

1825
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,820
And I'll be over there with my perfectly crafted, super
adorable looking Moe stormtroopers.

1826
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:26,740
Yeah!

1827
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,320
But they're the same.

1828
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:31,660
No, they look completely different.

1829
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,620
I promise.

1830
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,100
You like both?

1831
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:40,380
Based.

1832
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:44,500
Anyway, sorry.

1833
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:47,960
That's what I thought of when I saw this little...

1834
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:50,040
The lined up of robots.

1835
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:51,460
In a fight, right?

1836
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:01,770
I guess the generator can only...

1837
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:03,190
only do so much.

1838
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,340
Um, this robot looks kind of rusty.

1839
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:12,300
So mean.

1840
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,020
Scout troopers are technically stored.

1841
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:15,740
Stop.

1842
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,500
This seems to be a page ripped out of a book.

1843
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:25,420
Oh, without breaking the seal, inject the liquid phosphor
into the container.

1844
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:27,860
Shake vigorously to initiate the reaction.

1845
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:29,200
Use as soon as possible.

1846
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,660
Note, if elements begin to separate, further shaking is
required.

1847
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:33,860
Also note.

1848
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:35,700
Oh!

1849
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,940
Hand protection is critical after this step.

1850
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:41,720
The resulting acid is moderately stronger than common
household cleaners.

1851
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:44,560
I don't know what half of these words mean.

1852
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:45,860
Nico is a baby.

1853
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,220
It's a good thing that you're here, Admin, though.

1854
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:52,380
Cleaning sponge with a rough surface.

1855
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:54,900
Rusty!

1856
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,240
Rusty!

1857
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:01,220
No, don't combine.

1858
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:04,560
This robot could use a sponge!

1859
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:07,760
Stormtroopers ride big lizards

1860
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:18,560
The troopers and empires are the real heroes I stand by

1861
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:32,420
Let's see Wait but why didn't I feel like It's robot oh
they're all kind of rusty

1862
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:47,530
So we have Okay wait hold on So we have an empty bottle We
have the gloves What's the sponge for flat sponge with a

1863
01:50:47,530 --> 01:50:51,130
rough surface I thought it was for buffing out that rust

1864
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:16,940
I think we're missing some stuff still what was it what was
the instructions again oh acidic ass ass gas gas well

1865
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,400
ventilated area Can I not do it outside?

1866
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,560
Is that not the gas?

1867
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:44,640
Like this?

1868
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,700
I can't reach the top bad, Minto.

1869
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,040
Oh, no!

1870
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:53,940
We need a short guy.

1871
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:55,620
Or a chair.

1872
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:07,810
There's gotta be a short vent somewhere.

1873
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:13,810
Let's keep going up.

1874
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:19,930
What is this?

1875
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:21,330
A hole.

1876
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:23,930
Nico's doing their butt.

1877
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:24,790
What's this?

1878
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:29,250
There's something weird about the robots who get sent to
work near the gas fields.

1879
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:32,710
They appear to accumulate rust at a much slower rate than
the others.

1880
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:37,450
The few who work directly with gas harvesting look
practically new.

1881
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:40,990
Is that a result of the atmosphere or am I just seeing
things?

1882
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:41,770
Oh.

1883
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,060
Wait, where am I?

1884
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,580
Can I collect?

1885
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,580
Where am I?

1886
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,420
Oh!

1887
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:01,680
Hello.

1888
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,800
Do you need any help?

1889
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,060
I'm good, thanks!

1890
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:11,760
Power cell, I think.

1891
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:13,540
There's writing on this one too!

1892
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:16,200
It says Guardian of the Residential Area.

1893
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,380
Is this the Residential Area?

1894
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,500
This part gave me Cacher and Sim vibes.

1895
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:28,300
Oh my gosh, not Cacher, and I haven't thought of that all
forever.

1896
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,910
Scratch!

1897
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:35,790
Welcome to Mambusha Paraguay!

1898
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:37,390
Thank you, thank you.

1899
01:53:40,290 --> 01:53:43,390
Looks like they're evacuating the few tamed robots we have
here.

1900
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:44,190
Makes sense.

1901
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:47,370
No point in keeping them in the barrens if all the people
are already gone.

1902
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:50,070
I wonder if the engineer is going too.

1903
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:54,450
Apparently phase one of the evacuation ended prematurely.

1904
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:56,290
The big ship started malfunctioning.

1905
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,610
Only a few after a few round trips.

1906
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:01,310
They said it was due to something with squares?

1907
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:03,610
I'm not sure what they mean by that.

1908
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:08,790
Looks like they won't be able to transport most of these
surplus bots to the city at this rate.

1909
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:10,590
And we work so hard on those.

1910
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:15,510
But I suppose the robots...

1911
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:17,730
Oh my gosh, wait, they're actually robots!

1912
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:20,910
The guy on that ship is a robot!

1913
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:23,010
Because he's taking these...

1914
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:24,210
Oh my god.

1915
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:30,050
The robots are busy enough with transporting people as is.

1916
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,610
I think it's going to be our turn soon.

1917
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,360
Oh, I'm scared of ladders.

1918
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:39,860
Oh.

1919
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:46,580
Nico is not here for the thrill.

1920
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,020
Oh, this is the Guardian, no?

1921
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:50,800
Oh, hello.

1922
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,660
What are you doing here?

1923
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:57,420
A living person such as yourself should have evacuated this
place long ago.

1924
01:54:58,220 --> 01:54:59,180
Oh, but I just got here.

1925
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,660
To this world, I mean.

1926
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:01,920
See?

1927
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:02,840
I have the sun.

1928
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:04,660
Oh, the Messiah.

1929
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:07,220
I do not know what to say.

1930
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:08,320
Greetings.

1931
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,380
You was not part of my programming.

1932
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:13,080
Have you spoken to Prophet Bot?

1933
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:14,400
Oh yeah.

1934
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,380
Prophet Bot was built with the sole purpose of...

1935
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:20,000
Oh, so...

1936
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:23,860
It wasn't the thing that I saw.

1937
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,780
The power cell was not...

1938
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:28,820
Like, I don't...

1939
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:31,080
It's on because...

1940
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:32,980
It's powering the Prophet Bot.

1941
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:35,420
And so that thing is on, so it's powering this guy.

1942
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:37,340
I get it now, I get it now, I get it now.

1943
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:39,140
I get it now, I get it now.

1944
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:43,620
Prophet Bot was built with the sole purpose of greeting you.

1945
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:44,500
Really?

1946
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:47,720
Yes, he cannot speak with anyone else.

1947
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,420
At least not with ease.

1948
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,480
That's kind of sad.

1949
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,320
What are you built for then?

1950
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,840
My purpose is to guard this settlement.

1951
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:00,560
He's like the iron golems in Minecraft.

1952
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:08,900
Oh,

1953
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:17,360
even though the residents have long gone, I must remain.

1954
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:19,240
Why, though?

1955
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,860
I have not been tamed.

1956
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,680
It was not worth the effort.

1957
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:32,080
Keep blinking.

1958
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:35,760
What's this guy do?

1959
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,120
Oh, wait.

1960
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,360
This guy just said hi to me earlier.

1961
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:38,120
What's in here?

1962
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,940
Some of the ink on this page is faded.

1963
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:47,720
Likely due to some sort of electrical or magnetic
interference, I'm afraid this operation can no longer be

1964
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,120
sustained.

1965
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:51,840
If the servers continue to fail so much that maintenance
cannot keep up the pace.

1966
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,000
Fortunately, it does not seem to be happening.

1967
01:56:54,020 --> 01:57:01,480
to the robots at least not on a significant rate time will
tell checking checking terminal does not respond this is a

1968
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:13,840
problem all of these terminals do not boot i am not sure
what to do now i'm bored i mean though hello

1969
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:28,120
a picture of a robot you know i've never seen around so many
robots before i'd mean to or any robots at all.

1970
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:31,140
I mean, I see them in cartoons and stuff, but I've never
seen one in person.

1971
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,020
They're pretty neat, don't you think?

1972
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:35,780
Hey, Nico.

1973
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,000
Do a robot voice.

1974
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:40,580
What?

1975
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,220
Try talking like a robot.

1976
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:47,310
People.

1977
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:55,250
I am a robot, and I eat batteries instead of normal people
food.

1978
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:56,450
He...

1979
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:03,310
That is not correct.

1980
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:12,770
Robots do not consume batteries in the same way people
consume food.

1981
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:16,310
In fact, robots do not possess digestive systems.

1982
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:20,270
Some robots do not even have mouths.

1983
01:58:21,490 --> 01:58:23,270
Ooh, get told, Nico.

1984
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:27,670
Now I am looking at the camera, like...

1985
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:29,790
Admito, you made me look silly.

1986
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:34,350
I offended this guy.

1987
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:35,190
I'm sorry.

1988
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:37,510
Hi.

1989
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,070
What are you doing up there?

1990
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:41,090
I am stationed here.

1991
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:42,130
By yourself?

1992
01:58:42,930 --> 01:58:43,250
Yes.

1993
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:47,150
He hates me.

1994
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,760
I can't do anything else with him.

1995
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:57,340
Protect Nico at all costs.

1996
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:58,440
I made him look silly.

1997
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,080
I'm sorry.

1998
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,180
Oh, there's so much text.

1999
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:09,000
Hey, Sweetie, six more weeks until you can come home.

2000
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:10,040
About time, huh?

2001
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:14,900
Gosh, I can't imagine living in that awful capsule wall dorm
thing.

2002
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:15,680
But guess what?

2003
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:19,520
Soon, you'll get to sleep in a real bed and eat real food
again.

2004
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:20,860
Right back soon.

2005
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:21,700
Oh, mom.

2006
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:25,700
Love mom.

2007
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:39,180
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

2008
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,340
Aww.

2009
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,380
These exist...

2010
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:54,540
There exist fuel cells that can be powered by glucose and
blood.

2011
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:58,000
If you wanted to, we could make robots powered by blood.

2012
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,720
That is kind of cool.

2013
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,660
Isn't that concerning for humans though?

2014
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:08,720
What if they make a robot powered by...

2015
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:09,940
Soul?

2016
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:12,620
Like meat.

2017
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:14,160
Like a ghost.

2018
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,680
Looks like we're supposed to pack stuff for the evacuation
starting today.

2019
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,120
I want to say his books weren't so heavy.

2020
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:23,260
It's gonna be a pain to carry them onto the ship.

2021
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:25,160
But they're by the author.

2022
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,100
I can't just throw...

2023
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:27,740
They're by the author.

2024
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:29,540
Oh, the author is like a person.

2025
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:32,640
I can't just throw them away.

2026
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:35,580
Anybody?

2027
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:36,940
Nothing.

2028
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,080
I'm scared of ladders.

2029
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,340
Nico... Nico does not want to the thrill of going up the
ladder.

2030
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,780
Nico says, no thank you.

2031
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,540
Oh my god, there's so many buildings.

2032
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,740
I feel like I'm gonna get lost.

2033
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:01,060
Evacuation?

2034
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:02,440
As such short notice?

2035
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:03,400
I can't believe this!

2036
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,900
First the sun dies, now I'm out of a job!

2037
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:08,080
Not to complain.

2038
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:10,380
Some sort of mechanical drawing.

2039
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:18,860
Robot beyond repair Can I see?

2040
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:23,190
Nothing

2041
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,440
What do you have to say for yourself?

2042
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:35,280
Oh, this is the same guy as before So what's his name?

2043
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:48,720
Oh no Infirmary Wait, oh Organic person who is alive The
infirmary is up ahead I was going to say so be here but no.

2044
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:51,760
Did I read this one already?

2045
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:52,780
Oh yeah this is mom.

2046
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,980
Let's check out the infirmary then.

2047
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:04,390
Oh my gosh infirmary bot.

2048
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:07,190
It's a box of medical tools.

2049
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:12,730
Most of them are broken or rusted beyond use but this
plastic syringe seems to be okay.

2050
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:13,750
Nice.

2051
02:02:19,510 --> 02:02:21,130
Hello person of organic makeup.

2052
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:23,010
Welcome to the infirmary.

2053
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:24,930
Scanning for injuries.

2054
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,650
My brain is broken, Doc.

2055
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:29,650
Give me the diagnosis.

2056
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:30,930
Scan complete.

2057
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:32,310
Injuries detected?

2058
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:33,010
None.

2059
02:02:34,170 --> 02:02:35,070
Treatment required?

2060
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:35,670
None.

2061
02:02:36,270 --> 02:02:37,290
You are good to go.

2062
02:02:38,010 --> 02:02:38,870
All right, thanks.

2063
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:43,030
Hello, person.

2064
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:46,250
Are you seeking admission into the infirmary?

2065
02:02:47,010 --> 02:02:47,270
Nope.

2066
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:49,530
Oh, carry on, then.

2067
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:50,750
Interesting.

2068
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:52,430
Okay, anything here?

2069
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:54,550
None.

2070
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:56,890
Bill $700.

2071
02:02:58,590 --> 02:03:04,490
I looked at you in the eye Give me the money now

2072
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:14,510
Did I go in here?

2073
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:26,470
I think so Yeah That guy who's complaining I'm out of a job
Okay to be fair That's a valid complaint I'm not trying to

2074
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:32,890
minimize His struggles or anything I'm Forgetting what...

2075
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:35,550
Oh, we were supposed to do, like, this...

2076
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:37,750
Empty syringe.

2077
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:41,130
We were supposed to do, like, uh...

2078
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:42,410
Whatever that...

2079
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:45,130
There was, like, something that we read about.

2080
02:03:45,790 --> 02:03:47,550
But I don't think I have everything for it.

2081
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:50,150
Can I...

2082
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:57,790
I was gonna say, can I use the syringe to suck up some of
these shrimp?

2083
02:03:58,750 --> 02:03:59,630
I guess not.

2084
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:10,190
The importance of cleaning solvents.

2085
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:12,310
Yes, yes, yes.

2086
02:04:12,990 --> 02:04:16,030
I wanted to get some of the gas, but these are all too high.

2087
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:19,550
Oh, we're back here.

2088
02:04:19,890 --> 02:04:21,490
Wait, so this is a robot.

2089
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:22,650
Wait, we're...

2090
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:23,390
Him, him, him.

2091
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:25,150
This is a robot.

2092
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:31,140
I am functional!

2093
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:33,920
Was that you who fixed the generator?

2094
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,540
Well, Admito helped me.

2095
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:37,460
Bye-bye.

2096
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:39,560
Hello, nice to meet you.

2097
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,800
I am robot number three to...

2098
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:43,700
You guys!

2099
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,700
No way!

2100
02:04:46,060 --> 02:04:46,420
Three?

2101
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,380
Me?

2102
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:48,860
And then ten?

2103
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:49,840
Tall!

2104
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:52,180
It's Robot Meantol!

2105
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:54,640
Oh my god!

2106
02:05:00,010 --> 02:05:01,450
No way!

2107
02:05:04,790 --> 02:05:06,230
Robot Meantol!

2108
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:08,630
Would you like me to take you somewhere?

2109
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:12,230
Oh, uh-oh.

2110
02:05:12,470 --> 02:05:13,050
Are you okay?

2111
02:05:13,690 --> 02:05:14,730
I cannot move.

2112
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:16,410
Well, you're still really rusty.

2113
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:18,050
That is true.

2114
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:20,930
Hold on, Armito and I will find a way to help you.

2115
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:23,450
Let's do the sponge.

2116
02:05:24,610 --> 02:05:26,570
The sponge alone isn't gonna remove all this rust.

2117
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:28,410
Okay, we need the cleaning solvent, I think.

2118
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,760
He can't move!

2119
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:38,800
Shrimp swamp!

2120
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:40,380
What's that?

2121
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:42,340
Oh, here.

2122
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:46,300
This is a swamp?

2123
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:48,100
Of shrimp?

2124
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:49,580
Shrimp swamp.

2125
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,420
The shrimp swamp.

2126
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:52,580
Swamp.

2127
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:53,440
Swamp.

2128
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:59,380
I'm old and rusty.

2129
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:14,270
Trying to think.

2130
02:06:17,810 --> 02:06:18,070
Entrance.

2131
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:19,450
What is entrance?

2132
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:20,690
Oh.

2133
02:06:21,170 --> 02:06:22,190
Like where we first started?

2134
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:27,630
Huh.

2135
02:06:28,390 --> 02:06:31,090
But that's so interesting because...

2136
02:06:31,090 --> 02:06:32,090
Oh, he's awake now.

2137
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:34,190
I am functional.

2138
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:44,290
The outfit kind of reminds me of a character in Xenoblade.

2139
02:06:46,150 --> 02:06:53,450
The character, the character she looks like, she's like a
robot, but she also looks like Maranette from Miraculous

2140
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:54,210
Ladybug.

2141
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:57,370
Use a syringe on a pool.

2142
02:06:58,030 --> 02:07:03,910
I thought I tried that, but it doesn't like interact with it
at all.

2143
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:04,990
Here, hold on.

2144
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:06,050
We'll travel to it.

2145
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:08,830
Maybe I just did it wrong.

2146
02:07:11,210 --> 02:07:12,510
Because it won't let me interact with it.

2147
02:07:13,690 --> 02:07:14,290
Let's see.

2148
02:07:14,410 --> 02:07:15,010
Empty syringe.

2149
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:17,570
Yeah, it doesn't let you do anything.

2150
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:19,610
I did try.

2151
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:23,210
Maybe the bottle instead?

2152
02:07:26,230 --> 02:07:26,630
No.

2153
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:31,820
Poppy?

2154
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:32,360
Yeah!

2155
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:33,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2156
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:38,100
There's an area on the shrimp's swamp you missed.

2157
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:38,520
Oh, okay.

2158
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:39,840
Thank you.

2159
02:07:44,130 --> 02:07:45,030
Maybe up here.

2160
02:07:46,570 --> 02:07:47,430
Around here.

2161
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:48,830
Oh.

2162
02:07:49,910 --> 02:07:51,890
I think I'm out of the shrimp swamp.

2163
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:52,790
Wait a second.

2164
02:07:53,550 --> 02:07:53,810
No.

2165
02:07:56,970 --> 02:07:58,430
This is the dormitories.

2166
02:07:59,210 --> 02:07:59,210
Okay.

2167
02:08:01,770 --> 02:08:03,650
Finding this bit took me ages.

2168
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:06,050
Oh, the rare phosphorus.

2169
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:06,830
That's right.

2170
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:09,710
So it's got to be something kind of special.

2171
02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:10,530
special now?

2172
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:11,110
Okay.

2173
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:14,930
That's right.

2174
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:16,570
You are right.

2175
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:17,510
You are correct.

2176
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:22,760
You are so correct.

2177
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:24,940
They all look the same.

2178
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:30,700
They all be glistening and glimmer and shine and sparkling.

2179
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:44,640
Did I go over here?

2180
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:46,380
Aha!

2181
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:48,960
This pond sure looks different.

2182
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:50,720
The water looks like jelly.

2183
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:53,880
It's formed a bubble the surface of the pond.

2184
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:55,320
Okay, here we go.

2185
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:00,000
So we're filling up the syringe at Minto?

2186
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:02,260
I guess it's kind of like a funnel.

2187
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:05,060
But the liquid might be a bit too thick to fit in the
needle.

2188
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,260
Oh, it actually went in!

2189
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,520
Gross.

2190
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:11,660
Let's go?

2191
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:12,140
Okay.

2192
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:16,520
What are you doing here?

2193
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:18,420
The sky is dark.

2194
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:20,200
That it is.

2195
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:22,620
Do you know when the sun will lighten?

2196
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:23,520
be back up.

2197
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:25,120
We're working on it.

2198
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:31,190
Little guy.

2199
02:09:32,290 --> 02:09:32,490
Okay.

2200
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:35,330
So we have a filled syringe.

2201
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:40,050
I still need to get the... I almost said ass again.

2202
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:41,030
No way.

2203
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:45,750
I still need to get the... the gas.

2204
02:09:52,590 --> 02:09:55,710
But I think other than that, we have everything that we
would need.

2205
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:58,350
rubber gloves in the syringe.

2206
02:09:59,810 --> 02:09:59,890
Oh.

2207
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:06,730
Is it the old factory?

2208
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:07,810
Or which one is it?

2209
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:08,810
Yes.

2210
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:09,450
Okay.

2211
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:14,590
I feel like it's gotta be here maybe.

2212
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:18,270
Okay, hold on.

2213
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:19,890
Let me read the...

2214
02:10:19,890 --> 02:10:19,890
Okay.

2215
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:22,070
Simple recipe.

2216
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:25,130
Acidic gas.

2217
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:26,850
Blue phosphor.

2218
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:27,910
Rare form.

2219
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:28,470
We got that.

2220
02:10:29,890 --> 02:10:35,410
area direct the gas into your container of choice seal
immediately okay

2221
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:49,680
check the liquid phosphor into the container shake shake
vigorously use as soon as possible if elements begin to

2222
02:10:49,680 --> 02:11:03,780
separate further shaking as well okay hand protection okay
combine them for the solution yeah yeah yeah i just don't

2223
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:10,400
know i guess maybe it's similar where it's just one maybe
there's one that's like kind of shorter that I missed?

2224
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:11,800
Oh.

2225
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:21,200
Oh, stop it, please.

2226
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:23,660
Hmm.

2227
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:25,640
Like you're drying in front of the mirror.

2228
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:26,800
Oh, yeah, baby.

2229
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,500
Oh, yeah?

2230
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:48,500
I can't reach the top.

2231
02:11:51,930 --> 02:11:57,250
Is there, like, one by a hill or something?

2232
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:02,970
I'm not tall enough.

2233
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:30,920
If only Nico wasn't deathly afraid of the ladders.

2234
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:34,800
I'm trying to think.

2235
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,840
If I go inside the factory...

2236
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:45,000
It's...

2237
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:45,900
Wait, what's this?

2238
02:12:48,380 --> 02:12:49,180
Just a hole?

2239
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:53,240
Just a hole.

2240
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,300
Wait, is there anything back here?

2241
02:12:58,520 --> 02:12:59,320
Anything here?

2242
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:00,100
No.

2243
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:03,100
Hmm, no, no, no, no,

2244
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:11,200
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2245
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:13,320
No, no, no, no, no, this is the dormitories.

2246
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:19,840
I dunno!

2247
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:23,380
I don't know!

2248
02:13:26,580 --> 02:13:29,040
Am I, like, just, this...

2249
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,480
I feel... I've not seen it yet!

2250
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:32,760
How am I...

2251
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:33,940
Do I have the wrong...

2252
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:37,520
Wrong, wrong conclusion.

2253
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:43,200
Believe the gas vent you're looking for is also in the
shrimp swamp.

2254
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:45,640
Srupp!

2255
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:49,620
I'll check.

2256
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:55,970
Oh, gas vent.

2257
02:13:57,090 --> 02:13:58,910
Oh, gas vent.

2258
02:13:59,390 --> 02:14:00,230
Oh, poinsers.

2259
02:14:01,390 --> 02:14:02,510
That's the rare one.

2260
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:06,150
Any teeny tiny gas...

2261
02:14:06,150 --> 02:14:07,330
I mean, I feel like I could...

2262
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:08,650
just scoop up the air, you know?

2263
02:14:08,750 --> 02:14:10,290
Just a little bit of a...

2264
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:12,090
And that would be okay.

2265
02:14:12,650 --> 02:14:14,350
Because there's so much gas everywhere.

2266
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:27,350
Not yet.

2267
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,300
Can I get on top of this?

2268
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:40,200
Can't reach the top.

2269
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:45,160
What's over here?

2270
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:45,940
Ah!

2271
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:47,560
There it is.

2272
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:50,040
I guess you want me to fill the bottle with this gas,
Edminto?

2273
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:52,280
Yay!

2274
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,100
That ought to do it.

2275
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,480
I keep missing these tiny little pathways.

2276
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:05,400
Initially, the amount of noxious fumes emitted by the
natural gas vents caught our team off guard.

2277
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:08,520
Thank goodness the medical team reacted as quickly as they
did.

2278
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:14,040
Despite its failure, that first expedition did bring up some
interesting observations about the barons.

2279
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:18,040
We found that there's not one, but two such vent zones.

2280
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:23,620
With fumes being pumped out at such high concentrations,
that the gas hasn't spread it.

2281
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:26,340
It seems a miracle that the gas hasn't spread anywhere else.

2282
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,640
You're not alone in that.

2283
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:31,760
Thank you.

2284
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:37,500
Our biologist concluded that the phosphorus shrimp in the
crater pools were actively consuming the gas.

2285
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:43,480
The shrimp in the ocean also prevent the gas from wafting
off into the glen.

2286
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:46,780
They're hungry.

2287
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,740
If that's the case, then we owe a lot to these little guys.

2288
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:53,260
For real!

2289
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:55,040
Okay.

2290
02:15:56,300 --> 02:15:58,220
Now we can combine.

2291
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:09,640
Uh...

2292
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:11,860
Where was our...

2293
02:16:11,860 --> 02:16:12,900
Rowboat.

2294
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:14,620
Rowbot.

2295
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:16,640
Row-Bobot.

2296
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:19,680
Row-Robobot.

2297
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:21,960
Okay, okay, okay.

2298
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:23,580
You.

2299
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:24,360
Oops.

2300
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:27,160
My bulb is too big.

2301
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:30,300
Shout out to my shrimps.

2302
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:30,560
Okay.

2303
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:31,580
So now...

2304
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:39,300
Bottle of smoke Filled syringe Try and inject the liquid
through the cork, right?

2305
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:39,680
Yes.

2306
02:16:40,940 --> 02:16:41,900
It's like I'm a doctor.

2307
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:43,640
Oh!

2308
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,160
I should probably shake this too.

2309
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:46,160
Yes, yes, shake it.

2310
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:48,200
It changed color.

2311
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:51,460
We have a bottle of acid.

2312
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:56,220
I'm guessing you want me to pour this acid onto the sponge,
yes.

2313
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:57,780
Good thing I have these gloves.

2314
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:03,480
A good license plate number without the gas.

2315
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:06,000
Oh, thank you!

2316
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:07,760
I got it.

2317
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,240
The license plate.

2318
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,060
Come on, thank you so much for that 20!

2319
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:13,500
I'm through!

2320
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:14,480
Thank you!

2321
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:15,740
Alright.

2322
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:18,140
Now we have the sponge.

2323
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:21,020
The wet sponge.

2324
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:21,840
Okay, perfect.

2325
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:22,640
Come here.

2326
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:27,640
Alright, hold still.

2327
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:30,260
I have no other choice.

2328
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:59,400
Does this count as a sponge bath?

2329
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:00,200
I think so.

2330
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:01,060
How's that?

2331
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:03,980
I can't move again.

2332
02:18:04,580 --> 02:18:05,160
Thank you.

2333
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,400
I am able to fulfill my purpose again.

2334
02:18:10,060 --> 02:18:11,080
Where would you like to go?

2335
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:12,720
Can you take me to the tower?

2336
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:14,320
Calculating.

2337
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:18,600
Closest destination to the tower is the Glen.

2338
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:19,540
Port number.

2339
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:23,500
My built-in navigation circuits have fried.

2340
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:26,580
I'm gonna assume that's not good.

2341
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:29,040
She's really good.

2342
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:31,140
It is not good at all.

2343
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:34,240
Once again, I cannot follow my programming.

2344
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:35,440
Aww.

2345
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:37,560
Is there anything I can do to help?

2346
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:42,400
In the event of an error, you should speak with the head
engineer.

2347
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:44,560
She will know what to do.

2348
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,880
Is the head engineer...

2349
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:54,800
Out, no, lookout point?

2350
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,080
Is this our head engineer?

2351
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:00,920
Excuse me again, Miss.

2352
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:03,460
I found a robot who could take me towards the tower.

2353
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:06,740
I was having some trouble, so it told me to talk to you.

2354
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:08,160
All right.

2355
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:09,840
What is the issue?

2356
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:13,760
It said something about his navigation circuits being fried.

2357
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:18,160
Imagine being so good they name you the engineer.

2358
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:18,980
I know.

2359
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:21,780
It's just the engineer.

2360
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:23,600
Just navigation circuits?

2361
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,260
Apparently.

2362
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:29,960
Add Minto and I fix everything else, I think.

2363
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:30,940
Hmm.

2364
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:32,940
I have something that may help.

2365
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:36,720
Robots have the ability to trace material from their source
locations.

2366
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:41,600
If you let the robot borrow this, then its backup tracking
system should activate.

2367
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:43,080
Oh!

2368
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:44,720
Oh, CG!

2369
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:45,780
Wait.

2370
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:49,860
That journal we got had a clover on it.

2371
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:50,440
on it too.

2372
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:52,700
You yammeric.

2373
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:56,060
It's like big bars, but for engineer.

2374
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:57,220
Yeah, yeah.

2375
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:05,240
It's a very pretty necklace.

2376
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:06,720
What's it made of?

2377
02:20:07,420 --> 02:20:08,680
Amber found from the Glen.

2378
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:11,100
Yay, Nico!

2379
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:11,720
Yay, Rito!

2380
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:14,300
Yay, Emmets!

2381
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,560
What's the thing inside the amber?

2382
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:21,020
The black clover?

2383
02:20:21,660 --> 02:20:23,260
That's a common plant in our world.

2384
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:25,660
It's also...

2385
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:26,020
Hmm?

2386
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:29,200
I'm not sure if I can bear it apart with this.

2387
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:32,360
My programming says yes, but I still feel conflicted.

2388
02:20:36,310 --> 02:20:37,110
Yay, I blew!

2389
02:20:38,970 --> 02:20:40,610
This necklace is merch, by the way.

2390
02:20:41,390 --> 02:20:42,070
No way.

2391
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:43,210
Never mind.

2392
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:45,870
You need to finish your mission more than I need a keepsake.

2393
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:50,830
Here.

2394
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:52,290
Oh, thank you!

2395
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:02,870
Before I go, is there anything I can do in return?

2396
02:21:04,710 --> 02:21:06,810
Could I get a moe moe kume for one year?

2397
02:21:07,850 --> 02:21:08,650
Of course!

2398
02:21:10,150 --> 02:21:10,950
Moe moe!

2399
02:21:40,850 --> 02:21:42,890
Actually, do you know how to play chess?

2400
02:21:43,810 --> 02:21:44,110
Yeah!

2401
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:45,590
Well, sort of.

2402
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:47,610
I've played it with some older kids before.

2403
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:49,650
Then will you play a game with me?

2404
02:21:50,330 --> 02:21:52,050
I mean, I don't know the rules very well.

2405
02:21:52,950 --> 02:21:54,110
But I guess it's the least I can do.

2406
02:21:54,130 --> 02:22:05,290
do oh gosh please don't don't tell me what to do don't tell
me i have to play thank you holographic pop doors for about

2407
02:22:05,290 --> 02:22:18,450
10 months thank you you're really good at this thank you it
was built into my code ah so what's it like being a robot

2408
02:22:18,450 --> 02:22:26,150
and all i've talked to other robots and all they they all
say something about programming and code and stuff?

2409
02:22:27,010 --> 02:22:28,050
Even you did just now.

2410
02:22:28,850 --> 02:22:30,410
It's a little hard to understand sometimes.

2411
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:35,110
Kicking my stupid feet taking me down.

2412
02:22:35,130 --> 02:22:35,930
Of course!

2413
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:40,790
How did I stretch?

2414
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:48,790
I know.

2415
02:22:49,390 --> 02:22:50,950
Most of the robots here are not tamed.

2416
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:52,170
Tamed?

2417
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:53,390
Watch out.

2418
02:22:54,130 --> 02:22:55,910
Oh, there goes my bishop.

2419
02:22:57,010 --> 02:22:58,090
Taming is complicated.

2420
02:22:59,090 --> 02:22:59,570
Big stretch.

2421
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:02,090
Big stretch.

2422
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:03,650
Hello, Minto, you silly.

2423
02:23:04,350 --> 02:23:05,350
Hello, Daisuke.

2424
02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:06,270
You're sillier.

2425
02:23:08,410 --> 02:23:10,050
How complicated, exactly.

2426
02:23:12,190 --> 02:23:13,250
There goes another bishop.

2427
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:16,490
I can't really explain what tamed robots are.

2428
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:17,870
But I'm one of them.

2429
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:20,990
All the other tamed robots have been moved to other regions.

2430
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:23,630
Exactly where?

2431
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:24,110
I don't know.

2432
02:23:24,130 --> 02:23:25,230
Oh no.

2433
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:31,390
There goes my little horse.

2434
02:23:32,270 --> 02:23:32,470
Knight.

2435
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:35,970
What's the horse?

2436
02:23:37,810 --> 02:23:38,170
Horse.

2437
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:48,720
Haunts.

2438
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,700
Have you ever been to any other regions?

2439
02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:53,400
I heard that there's two more.

2440
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:54,900
In the past, yes.

2441
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:57,340
I still have the data, the coordinates, the memories.

2442
02:23:58,120 --> 02:23:59,860
I don't know how much of that still holds true.

2443
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:02,540
The world may be a very different place now.

2444
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:04,580
Umah?

2445
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:05,360
Umah?

2446
02:24:05,740 --> 02:24:05,740
Umah?

2447
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:06,740
Umah?

2448
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,040
Because the sun is gone?

2449
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:09,940
No.

2450
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,600
I said this already, didn't I?

2451
02:24:13,340 --> 02:24:14,880
The sun probably won't save the world.

2452
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:18,840
The decaying started before- back before the sun went out.

2453
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:22,340
The sun's sudden death was just the tipping point.

2454
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,420
And things went south really fast after that.

2455
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:26,080
Oh.

2456
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:30,300
And there's nothing I can do?

2457
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:31,460
Check.

2458
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:32,440
Ah!

2459
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:35,060
When did your queen get there?

2460
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:37,740
The only thing you can do is complete your pilgrimage.

2461
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:42,680
In a way, you are only supposed to be a second chance for
the people.

2462
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:47,620
Just like how the barons was only supposed to be a second
chance for me.

2463
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,420
There's no guarantee that things will work out.

2464
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:52,180
But...

2465
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:52,720
Check me.

2466
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:55,890
Alright.

2467
02:24:56,310 --> 02:24:57,630
Guess I've kept you long enough.

2468
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:03,670
Ah, sorry.

2469
02:25:04,090 --> 02:25:04,870
Thank you for listening.

2470
02:25:06,010 --> 02:25:07,010
I hope you get home safely.

2471
02:25:08,050 --> 02:25:08,230
Oh, sorry.

2472
02:25:09,070 --> 02:25:10,250
Oh, thank you also.

2473
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:14,920
The music.

2474
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:18,920
So emoy.

2475
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:20,900
Wait a second, what does this one say then?

2476
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:24,100
Oh, the power cell.

2477
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:25,460
Silver is written.

2478
02:25:25,660 --> 02:25:27,240
Ah, so this is silver.

2479
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:29,180
Why does it say that?

2480
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:30,060
That's not important.

2481
02:25:30,380 --> 02:25:31,720
Okay, so this is silver.

2482
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:35,200
Ah, okay.

2483
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:37,320
We understand now.

2484
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:42,310
Oh, there is a silver.

2485
02:25:42,330 --> 02:25:43,330
There is a thing for docks.

2486
02:25:43,550 --> 02:25:44,330
I just saw it.

2487
02:25:46,010 --> 02:25:46,870
There we go.

2488
02:25:53,010 --> 02:25:53,530
Minto robot!

2489
02:25:54,510 --> 02:25:55,830
A come bearing gift.

2490
02:25:56,430 --> 02:25:56,810
What do I...

2491
02:25:56,810 --> 02:25:57,690
What did she give me?

2492
02:25:58,350 --> 02:25:58,970
Oh, the amber.

2493
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:02,550
Silver the hedgehog.

2494
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:06,930
Have you talked to me?

2495
02:26:06,930 --> 02:26:06,950
Oh, the amber.

2496
02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:08,110
Have you talked to the head engineer yet?

2497
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:10,250
She lives near the mine entrance.

2498
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:12,870
I would have given you the coordinates, but...

2499
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:13,570
Oh, that's right.

2500
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:14,350
I have to equip it.

2501
02:26:14,470 --> 02:26:14,850
There we go.

2502
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:16,330
Um...

2503
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:17,330
Ad minto...

2504
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:20,570
Is it alright if you let me take a nap somewhere before we
go?

2505
02:26:21,110 --> 02:26:21,770
I'm so tired.

2506
02:26:21,890 --> 02:26:23,170
I can't even see straight anymore.

2507
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:24,290
Oh.

2508
02:26:26,570 --> 02:26:27,010
Okay.

2509
02:26:29,390 --> 02:26:30,930
Uh, where was I bed at?

2510
02:26:31,890 --> 02:26:33,570
That's not gonna close my game, is it?

2511
02:26:35,570 --> 02:26:35,990
Yeah?

2512
02:26:37,470 --> 02:26:39,110
I'm a little tired from walking.

2513
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:40,570
Is it alright if I take a nap?

2514
02:26:43,110 --> 02:26:43,550
Yes.

2515
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,640
That's my game?

2516
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:51,720
Just close my game immediately.

2517
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:55,540
Wait a second.

2518
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:01,060
Okay.

2519
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:02,660
Hold on.

2520
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:04,840
I'm still trying to figure out how I can drag this over.

2521
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:06,920
Maybe I should just plug a mouse in.

2522
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:09,100
Hold on.

2523
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:11,560
Wait, I could do this too.

2524
02:27:13,940 --> 02:27:14,380
Close.

2525
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:17,180
Don't save.

2526
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:29,960
Give me a second.

2527
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:32,840
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2528
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:34,680
Ho-to-binto.

2529
02:27:39,210 --> 02:27:42,610
Oh, it doesn't show anything.

2530
02:27:42,890 --> 02:27:43,330
Okay, we're fine.

2531
02:27:45,630 --> 02:27:45,930
Play.

2532
02:27:46,550 --> 02:27:47,130
Play game.

2533
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:48,050
Launching game.

2534
02:27:50,030 --> 02:27:50,250
Oh.

2535
02:27:54,220 --> 02:27:55,300
What is this?

2536
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:00,880
What's happening?

2537
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:12,340
Oh.

2538
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:15,920
Oh.

2539
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:19,360
Admito, are you still there?

2540
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:20,600
Yes.

2541
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:21,600
Ah!

2542
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:25,030
Cute!

2543
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:27,070
I had a dream just now.

2544
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:28,690
I saw...

2545
02:28:28,690 --> 02:28:29,150
You did?

2546
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:30,350
Wow.

2547
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:31,430
I...

2548
02:28:31,430 --> 02:28:33,390
I really thought I was back home.

2549
02:28:34,410 --> 02:28:37,650
Well, the sun back in my home world isn't a light bulb.

2550
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:40,450
It's a big ball of fire in the sky.

2551
02:28:41,190 --> 02:28:44,250
I don't think I would be able to hold it like I do with the
sun from your world.

2552
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:51,280
Huh?

2553
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:53,860
This isn't the world I live in.

2554
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:54,380
Really?

2555
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:56,060
I guess not.

2556
02:28:56,940 --> 02:28:59,440
If you're the god of this world, you wouldn't necessarily be
in it.

2557
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:01,660
What's your homeworld called?

2558
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:05,840
That's a secret.

2559
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:12,980
I see.

2560
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,040
Does your world have a sun?

2561
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:21,400
Yes, it's also a ball of fire.

2562
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,000
Really?

2563
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:24,640
Wow.

2564
02:29:25,380 --> 02:29:26,100
Can you hold it?

2565
02:29:28,020 --> 02:29:29,480
That was a silly question, wasn't it?

2566
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,600
The sun in my world is very bright.

2567
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:32,600
Warm too.

2568
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:33,840
You saw it, right?

2569
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:36,000
But it goes away sometimes at night.

2570
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:38,740
I think it's dark, kind of like how this world is now.

2571
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:41,660
But it's okay because the sun always comes back the next
day.

2572
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:43,300
That's good, don't you think?

2573
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:45,780
My world is like that too!

2574
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:49,900
Do you sleep during the night?

2575
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,240
What did I do?

2576
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:54,920
We go to sleep usually.

2577
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:57,920
But sometimes people stay up and use computers.

2578
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:00,200
Literally talking about me?

2579
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:03,300
I don't have to explain what they are, do I?

2580
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:05,120
There's a bunch of them in this world.

2581
02:30:06,180 --> 02:30:07,180
Anyway, we should get going.

2582
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,440
Poor Minto robot is like...

2583
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:12,380
So confused.

2584
02:30:14,580 --> 02:30:15,600
Called out.

2585
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:18,180
Who's using computers at night?

2586
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:19,460
Who's doing that?

2587
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:26,820
This is Amber from the Glen.

2588
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:28,840
I can remember now.

2589
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:31,100
Activating tracking system.

2590
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:32,840
Setting course.

2591
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:33,600
Wait.

2592
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:36,280
This boat is over capacity.

2593
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:36,760
Wait!

2594
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:40,760
You'll need to leave behind some of your possessions.

2595
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:41,480
Whoa.

2596
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,820
I don't think I'll be needing this crow.

2597
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:44,520
No!

2598
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:45,940
My crowbar!

2599
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,460
I've never used a computer before.

2600
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:51,540
It's my first day on Earth.

2601
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:52,720
I've never used one before.

2602
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,500
Or this gas mask and gloves.

2603
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:02,100
I'm just dumping them into the ocean.

2604
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:03,740
Sorry, shrimp.

2605
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:05,600
That is acceptable.

2606
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:08,360
I was wondering if you have any plans to put your music on
Spotify.

2607
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:09,020
Yes!

2608
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:09,740
Eventually.

2609
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:13,860
I would just talk to Steiner about that today, actually.

2610
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:15,540
So...

2611
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:17,620
Onwards we go.

2612
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:19,860
My crowbar!

2613
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:21,980
Oh, cute!

2614
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:23,400
So cute.

2615
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:24,880
Aww.

2616
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:26,120
Aww.

2617
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:40,970
The art in this game is so stinking cute.

2618
02:31:42,010 --> 02:31:42,450
Fireflies.

2619
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:45,110
Here is your stop, the Glen.

2620
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:46,410
Thank you.

2621
02:31:47,250 --> 02:31:50,970
There should be a village to the north, but that's all I can
recall.

2622
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:52,590
Oh, that's good to know.

2623
02:31:53,370 --> 02:31:53,810
Farewell.

2624
02:31:54,430 --> 02:31:56,230
May your mission be a success.

2625
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:57,750
Are you leaving?

2626
02:31:58,470 --> 02:31:58,790
Yes.

2627
02:31:59,410 --> 02:32:00,930
I must return to my state.

2628
02:32:00,970 --> 02:32:01,870
Is this not the station?

2629
02:32:03,230 --> 02:32:04,130
But you'll be home.

2630
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:23,310
alone again it's okay I have not been tamed what's in here
is this someone's house I'm coming in knock knock oh whoa oh

2631
02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:39,130
the tower right there we're in the swamp Wow what are all
those bubbles in the water Dickey.

2632
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:41,350
Oh, wait, what's here?

2633
02:32:41,610 --> 02:32:41,830
Aha!

2634
02:32:43,410 --> 02:32:44,290
Oh, I see.

2635
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:45,390
Nobody's here.

2636
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:47,230
All the trees even have been caught.

2637
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:48,130
That's a person.

2638
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:50,150
Oh.

2639
02:32:50,710 --> 02:32:51,490
Oh my gosh.

2640
02:32:51,570 --> 02:32:52,150
They're playing Toho.

2641
02:32:52,510 --> 02:32:53,130
Wait, please.

2642
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:54,190
Please.

2643
02:32:54,530 --> 02:32:55,950
Can I just one word to you?

2644
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,630
One word.

2645
02:32:57,790 --> 02:32:58,090
Please.

2646
02:32:58,890 --> 02:32:59,550
Okay, hold on.

2647
02:32:59,870 --> 02:33:00,430
He'll come to me.

2648
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:02,050
No, dang it.

2649
02:33:02,090 --> 02:33:02,890
I just missed him.

2650
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:10,240
I'm catching fireflies for mommy.

2651
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:12,980
I see.

2652
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:15,080
The jar is full of fireflies.

2653
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:17,500
So we got shrimp and we got fireflies.

2654
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:23,860
Oh my gosh, this is ASMR for real.

2655
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:24,480
The sound.

2656
02:33:25,740 --> 02:33:26,100
Oh yeah.

2657
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:27,720
Sounds good.

2658
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:29,120
Wait, hold on.

2659
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:32,820
You would not believe your eyes.

2660
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:35,620
You would not believe your eyes.

2661
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,220
You would not believe your eyes.

2662
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,260
Hmm, nothing's batting.

2663
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:44,700
I see.

2664
02:33:45,220 --> 02:33:45,920
What about you?

2665
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:48,260
I'll bite.

2666
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:56,330
There was a time where our people used to live in these
ruins.

2667
02:33:58,450 --> 02:33:59,190
What are you doing now?

2668
02:33:59,890 --> 02:34:03,470
But due to flooding, most of us have moved to less permanent
settlements.

2669
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:07,950
Can mean to be a fish?

2670
02:34:11,650 --> 02:34:12,910
I'm a piranha.

2671
02:34:13,670 --> 02:34:14,750
I'm a piranha.

2672
02:34:16,510 --> 02:34:18,430
There's one missable thing in this area.

2673
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:20,230
Do you want us to tell you if you miss it?

2674
02:34:20,510 --> 02:34:22,190
Oh, yes, that would be good, I think.

2675
02:34:23,230 --> 02:34:23,730
Flooding.

2676
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:26,890
Aye, the land has gotten brittle.

2677
02:34:27,770 --> 02:34:30,450
The Glen used to be in One Piece.

2678
02:34:31,010 --> 02:34:34,310
Did you guys see the season one of One Piece's ending?

2679
02:34:36,830 --> 02:34:41,930
I had no idea that One Piece was literally one season long.

2680
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:44,030
I cannot believe that.

2681
02:34:48,930 --> 02:35:03,670
what just watch one piece bro it's only one season long it
gets good in the second season just stick it out bro it's so

2682
02:35:03,670 --> 02:35:11,510
dumb i love it so stupid it's so funny the one season just
it's one season bro Come on!

2683
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:19,480
But now it's just a bunch of islands that get smaller and
smaller.

2684
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:20,600
Oh my gosh, Florida.

2685
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:25,120
Are these...

2686
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,160
So these are fireflies.

2687
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:27,340
Oh, excuse me.

2688
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:28,960
Fireflies, yeah.

2689
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:30,380
It's a bed.

2690
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:31,660
Well, more like a mattress.

2691
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:33,000
A futon.

2692
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:34,900
Warm coals.

2693
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:35,520
Soup?

2694
02:35:36,180 --> 02:35:37,060
Fish stew!

2695
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:38,600
Yummy.

2696
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:41,360
Filled with small dried fish.

2697
02:35:45,070 --> 02:35:46,670
I'm so Florida-brained.

2698
02:35:46,690 --> 02:35:47,350
right now.

2699
02:35:47,930 --> 02:35:51,230
I go to Florida once and I make it my entire personality.

2700
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:53,970
Oh wait, this is where I came from, though.

2701
02:35:56,890 --> 02:35:57,470
Maybe not.

2702
02:35:57,670 --> 02:35:58,050
I don't know.

2703
02:36:01,660 --> 02:36:02,980
Did I drive Wawa as no?

2704
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:03,980
Oh!

2705
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:06,560
What is this?

2706
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:07,620
Oh!

2707
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:09,840
Oh!

2708
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:12,100
Can I go in here?

2709
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:17,940
Last week I saw more of those squares while out fishing.

2710
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:20,460
I knew better than to get too close, though.

2711
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:21,140
Squares?

2712
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:22,400
Squares, man.

2713
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:23,740
They're bad news.

2714
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:24,480
Love this game.

2715
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:25,120
Very comfy.

2716
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:26,920
Thank you!

2717
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:27,680
Oh, Nemesis!

2718
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:29,140
Thanks for three bonds.

2719
02:36:29,540 --> 02:36:29,820
Thank you!

2720
02:36:32,820 --> 02:36:33,660
The squares.

2721
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:34,920
The squares.

2722
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:36,300
Stay away from the squares.

2723
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:40,080
Sheep.

2724
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,400
Whoa.

2725
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,900
I didn't expect...

2726
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:47,520
I didn't expect a sheep sound.

2727
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:48,000
Oh.

2728
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:49,260
What do you do?

2729
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:51,720
The crops have been growing poorly without the sun.

2730
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:54,680
And there's no telling how long our surpluses will last.

2731
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,720
Please, Savior, you have to hurry.

2732
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:59,540
I'll do my best.

2733
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:02,280
Hi, Minto.

2734
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:03,120
Hi, Vic.

2735
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:04,280
Bye, boys.

2736
02:37:05,100 --> 02:37:06,460
Thank you for 19 months.

2737
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:08,600
Bye.

2738
02:37:13,450 --> 02:37:13,890
Hmm.

2739
02:37:14,390 --> 02:37:16,710
I need someone to help me herd my rams.

2740
02:37:17,310 --> 02:37:18,290
Oh, I could do that.

2741
02:37:19,810 --> 02:37:28,610
do it at back home you kind of just push him around hmm but
you are carrying the Sun ah wait can you just watch the Sun

2742
02:37:28,610 --> 02:37:38,710
for me that seems I cannot I am but a simple Shepherd I'm
okay come back when your hands are free he will be rewarded

2743
02:37:38,710 --> 02:37:50,360
if he can herd my Rams okay is this guy all right what's
wrong with him

2744
02:38:01,070 --> 02:38:03,370
Oh my gosh, Oregon Trail.

2745
02:38:04,790 --> 02:38:05,230
Heya.

2746
02:38:05,430 --> 02:38:06,690
You here to trade?

2747
02:38:07,570 --> 02:38:07,790
Trade?

2748
02:38:08,410 --> 02:38:08,830
Yeah.

2749
02:38:09,630 --> 02:38:10,950
Is there anything you want to get rid of?

2750
02:38:11,770 --> 02:38:13,790
Make me an offer and I'll give you something in return.

2751
02:38:14,530 --> 02:38:16,810
The sheep on something else must be a skinwalker.

2752
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:25,760
Do we have something like that, Adminto?

2753
02:38:32,090 --> 02:38:33,450
Just give away my son.

2754
02:38:34,730 --> 02:38:36,210
I offer my son.

2755
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:37,390
I offer my son.

2756
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:40,670
What was this?

2757
02:38:42,070 --> 02:38:44,070
Some kind of cloak or shawl folded neatly.

2758
02:38:45,990 --> 02:38:47,990
It's a pair of shoes and some jewelry.

2759
02:38:49,850 --> 02:38:50,890
Looks like an altar.

2760
02:38:51,690 --> 02:38:52,930
Did we put the sun here?

2761
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:54,870
The staff?

2762
02:38:55,050 --> 02:38:57,310
Reminds me of the one that robot from the barons is holding.

2763
02:38:59,010 --> 02:38:59,990
It's an orb!

2764
02:39:00,670 --> 02:39:01,950
The material looks like amber.

2765
02:39:03,010 --> 02:39:04,070
Oh, I wonder then.

2766
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:09,750
I guess not.

2767
02:39:10,770 --> 02:39:12,070
Minto complete the ritual.

2768
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:14,610
The goats are after me!

2769
02:39:18,210 --> 02:39:20,950
I can never escape the goats!

2770
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:28,080
Are they buy in?

2771
02:39:28,780 --> 02:39:30,940
The flood can take away our farmlands.

2772
02:39:31,380 --> 02:39:32,860
But it can't take away our fish!

2773
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:34,460
So true.

2774
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:39,560
Complete the ritual.

2775
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:45,880
Oh, what's this?

2776
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:48,000
The doorway is full of vines, Adminto.

2777
02:39:53,900 --> 02:40:01,580
I'm helping set up a new TV I hope I don't drop I hope we
don't drop We can never escape the goats Because you are the

2778
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:03,320
god Next

2779
02:40:08,490 --> 02:40:12,850
You flatter me What's going on here

2780
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:21,050
Wee Wait Is this guy still screaming?

2781
02:40:22,370 --> 02:40:24,030
Why is he like that?

2782
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:31,070
He's like trying out for some sort of band.

2783
02:40:32,750 --> 02:40:33,610
Oh, you guys on fish stew?

2784
02:40:34,390 --> 02:40:35,210
Looks like moss.

2785
02:40:35,550 --> 02:40:36,470
Oh, never mind.

2786
02:40:39,090 --> 02:40:41,110
I guess people eat those.

2787
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:43,190
Coles.

2788
02:40:45,310 --> 02:40:49,290
It's slowly being chipped away already, but it's still
trying to stay alive, I think.

2789
02:40:49,850 --> 02:40:50,390
Doesn't matter.

2790
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:52,470
One day the world will finally give up this fight.

2791
02:40:52,990 --> 02:40:54,230
I just hope I'm not alive to see.

2792
02:40:54,250 --> 02:41:03,530
it i'm bringing back the sun though that won't fix the root
of the problem just like the other lady said but don't lose

2793
02:41:03,530 --> 02:41:10,630
heart without the sun the world will die much faster at the
very least i'm sure everyone would love like to see the sun

2794
02:41:10,630 --> 02:41:27,580
again guys doesn't seem so good seems a little bleak the
land is fragmenting at an alarming rate when this town

2795
02:41:27,580 --> 02:41:29,700
finally loses to the intruding sea.

2796
02:41:30,260 --> 02:41:31,820
We'll have to find another place to settle.

2797
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:39,700
Or you could evolve to have to have legs.

2798
02:41:39,980 --> 02:41:41,080
I mean, no, sorry.

2799
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:45,180
To have fins

2800
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:56,060
and gills.

2801
02:41:57,420 --> 02:42:01,200
Just be like those creatures that were like, I don't want to
live in the sea anymore.

2802
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:03,360
And then they hop on land.

2803
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:06,280
Okay, granite.

2804
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:13,420
Is that the sun?

2805
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:14,320
Yeah.

2806
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:15,900
And you're holding it?

2807
02:42:16,220 --> 02:42:16,860
Isn't it hot?

2808
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:17,960
Not really.

2809
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:19,280
It's nice and warm.

2810
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:21,540
Oh.

2811
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:23,100
Oh my gosh.

2812
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:25,100
Don't send Lincoln here.

2813
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:26,860
This is it.

2814
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:28,520
The last of our grain surpluses.

2815
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:31,200
And now we're dealing with a vermin problem.

2816
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:33,440
Maybe you can get cats?

2817
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:35,540
Not that I'm a cat, I mean.

2818
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:38,200
Oats.

2819
02:42:39,860 --> 02:42:40,880
Heads of hoit.

2820
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:42,880
Looks like flower.

2821
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:44,000
Oots.

2822
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:46,880
What's this one?

2823
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:47,700
Oots.

2824
02:42:53,010 --> 02:42:53,450
Oots.

2825
02:42:58,670 --> 02:43:00,090
Fireflies light up the room.

2826
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:01,590
That was a bright room.

2827
02:43:02,150 --> 02:43:03,210
Wow, there's so many houses.

2828
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:07,650
It's not ready yet, but would you like some stew?

2829
02:43:08,350 --> 02:43:09,610
I'm not hungry, but thank you.

2830
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:11,410
It's the least I can offer the same.

2831
02:43:11,430 --> 02:43:11,690
Savior.

2832
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:16,700
Oots.

2833
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:21,800
You're going to get dizzy if he keeps spinning around like
that.

2834
02:43:22,540 --> 02:43:23,400
I'm the tower.

2835
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:24,180
Oh.

2836
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:29,100
Grandpa says the tower used to spin all the time bringing
sunlight to the world.

2837
02:43:29,960 --> 02:43:30,800
I want to see it too.

2838
02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:32,220
Well, I'm here now.

2839
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:34,620
I guess it'll only be a matter of time again.

2840
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:36,520
Spin, spin, spin, spin.

2841
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:45,280
Most of the green moss covering our village has already lost
its glow.

2842
02:43:46,380 --> 02:43:52,120
If it wasn't for the thin strip left on the boundaries of
the land, people could easily fall into the ocean.

2843
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:56,100
Without light, land and water becomes indistinguishable
here.

2844
02:43:56,380 --> 02:43:57,320
That's true, though.

2845
02:43:57,860 --> 02:43:58,600
It's kind of scary.

2846
02:43:58,820 --> 02:44:01,200
Oh my gosh, the ocean at night is like scary.

2847
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:05,280
It's so dark and vast and everything.

2848
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:09,540
The sun is a lighthouse.

2849
02:44:09,780 --> 02:44:10,600
It seems like it, right?

2850
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:15,180
So this is where we came from before.

2851
02:44:16,460 --> 02:44:18,480
Yes, there should be like that little girl running around.

2852
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:19,300
There she is.

2853
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:19,800
Okay, cool.

2854
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:22,200
Where have I not gone to?

2855
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:25,940
Uh, I went in here before, right?

2856
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:27,640
Yeah.

2857
02:44:29,360 --> 02:44:33,260
Um, okay, so now we can go down.

2858
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:39,560
I don't think I, yeah.

2859
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:41,720
Was there anything over here?

2860
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,040
Let me just double check.

2861
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:45,480
Mm-hmm.

2862
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:46,600
Cool.

2863
02:44:51,360 --> 02:44:53,920
But when there's a full moon on the ocean, it looks so cool.

2864
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:55,240
That's true.

2865
02:44:56,680 --> 02:44:57,040
Alula?

2866
02:44:58,200 --> 02:44:59,440
Alula, where did you go?

2867
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:01,460
Alito, did you hear that?

2868
02:45:02,480 --> 02:45:02,880
Alula?

2869
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:04,180
Is that berry bug?

2870
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:06,440
I think it's coming from southeast of here.

2871
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:11,460
Well, these trees are kind of freaky.

2872
02:45:16,380 --> 02:45:17,280
Hey, you there.

2873
02:45:18,060 --> 02:45:19,020
Have you seen a little girl?

2874
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:20,920
She's a little bit shorter than you in.

2875
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:23,120
Wait, that's the sun.

2876
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:33,760

2877
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:41,460

but what does she look like a little shorter than you long

2878
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:51,240
blue hair two blue feathers on the top of her head I'm sorry
I haven't seen anyone like that freaky a freaky freaky is me

2879
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:58,680

ruins she said she was headed towards the forest so i'm

2880
02:45:58,680 --> 02:46:09,780

for her then she fell into this square oh my gosh what if it

2881
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:21,960
like the land fragmented while she was just standing there
sucked her in whoa this place is a maze oh whoa

2882
02:46:28,060 --> 02:46:29,380
How tall is Minto?

2883
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:33,440
Like, actually?

2884
02:46:33,940 --> 02:46:35,000
Or in the game?

2885
02:46:39,970 --> 02:46:41,370
Not a dream like that once.

2886
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:43,490
I've been reading this webtoon.

2887
02:46:44,550 --> 02:46:46,210
Um, called, what is it?

2888
02:46:46,330 --> 02:46:47,090
Fourth period?

2889
02:46:56,790 --> 02:46:59,590
It's like something period clash.

2890
02:47:00,130 --> 02:47:02,150
But I can't remember what number it is.

2891
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:05,330
Oh, 44th period.

2892
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:14,310
survival class it's like yeah 44th period classroom yeah
i've been reading that and it's basically about like uh

2893
02:47:14,310 --> 02:47:22,090
about like these holes that are just opening around on like
just anywhere they're just kind of like and people are like

2894
02:47:22,090 --> 02:47:30,890
what are these holes and when you go in like you don't only
few people have gone in and come out and basically this

2895
02:47:30,890 --> 02:47:33,770
whole school gets like sucked into a giant hole

2896
02:47:40,610 --> 02:47:49,390
they are in there and like it's their school but like
there's monsters that have kind of like been created based

2897
02:47:49,390 --> 02:48:01,610
off of like the the rules of the school so for example
there'll be like a um like no wandering the halls during

2898
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:09,990
class time kind of monster so they have to wait until like
the breaks in between classes to go explore the area.

2899
02:48:10,310 --> 02:48:11,210
It's pretty interesting.

2900
02:48:11,770 --> 02:48:12,590
Sounds like Corpse Party.

2901
02:48:13,150 --> 02:48:14,390
Sort of.

2902
02:48:14,770 --> 02:48:15,990
It's interesting.

2903
02:48:16,210 --> 02:48:17,790
So far, I'm kind of into it recently.

2904
02:48:19,470 --> 02:48:20,450
It's neat.

2905
02:48:22,130 --> 02:48:23,110
It's neat.

2906
02:48:26,070 --> 02:48:27,510
I'm into it.

2907
02:48:27,910 --> 02:48:27,950
Yeah.

2908
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:28,730
What was the name?

2909
02:48:30,210 --> 02:48:32,670
44th period classroom or something?

2910
02:48:33,810 --> 02:48:34,190
Yeah.

2911
02:48:38,060 --> 02:48:38,720
Yeah.

2912
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:48,100
it's kind of it's just a little spooky like the monsters are
like a little unnerving usually but it's not like I wouldn't

2913
02:48:48,100 --> 02:48:57,420
say it's horror horror but just a little a little spooky
44th period survival class yeah that one that one yeah

2914
02:48:58,940 --> 02:49:09,660
that's my my recommendation currently hello person welcome

2915
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:10,500
Silver Point.

2916
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:11,420
No?

2917
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:13,320
Oh, carry on then.

2918
02:49:13,460 --> 02:49:14,580
Oh, okay, fine.

2919
02:49:15,700 --> 02:49:16,800
You hate me.

2920
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:19,980
Who are you?

2921
02:49:21,860 --> 02:49:22,820
Research Station.

2922
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:23,260
Hello.

2923
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:24,800
Did Dr. Silver Point send you?

2924
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:26,460
No, I'm with Admin, though.

2925
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:27,960
Oh, carry on, then.

2926
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:28,320
Oh.

2927
02:49:29,700 --> 02:49:30,900
I want to learn.

2928
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:32,900
I want to...

2929
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:34,920
Oh, the bots are discussing.

2930
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:36,980
How come you're red instead of green?

2931
02:49:37,780 --> 02:49:39,200
Well, more of purple than red.

2932
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:41,440
But your eyes and stuff are red.

2933
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:45,460
I am only here to pick up this week's moss samples.

2934
02:49:46,180 --> 02:49:48,440
I will return to my station in the city soon.

2935
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:50,920
I see.

2936
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:55,140
I let VTubers influence my game purchases.

2937
02:49:56,940 --> 02:49:58,480
What do you mean too much?

2938
02:49:58,760 --> 02:49:59,920
I think it's not bad.

2939
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:06,060
To, you know, you see somebody playing a game and then you
want to try it out yourself?

2940
02:50:06,220 --> 02:50:07,440
I think that's totally reasonable.

2941
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:09,040
Hold on, you guys.

2942
02:50:09,080 --> 02:50:09,660
I'm going to be right back.

2943
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:23,840
I'm gonna go get some more juice and by juice I mean tea on
your back I will be right back right right back right back

2944
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:25,160
right back

2945
02:50:29,120 --> 02:52:12,880
I'm back I'm back I'm back I'm back Wait a second My
headphones are Oh Yeah Ta-da-da-da

2946
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:19,800
Let me set up everything.

2947
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:21,920
Okay.

2948
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:27,020
I'm gonna have some of this throat syrup because my
throat...

2949
02:52:27,020 --> 02:52:33,020
I'm still recovering from holiday Matsuri and all the
speaking I had to do.

2950
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:38,060
So when I talk for a really long time, my throat's been
hurting a bit.

2951
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:45,000
Okay.

2952
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:45,940
What's this guy saying?

2953
02:52:47,160 --> 02:52:49,560
I am in charge of collecting the moss samples.

2954
02:52:50,060 --> 02:52:50,420
Cool.

2955
02:52:51,260 --> 02:52:51,580
Cool.

2956
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:52,900
What's in here?

2957
02:52:53,400 --> 02:52:55,000
Oh, who are you?

2958
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:56,440
Hello, person.

2959
02:52:56,900 --> 02:52:58,260
This is the main generator of the Glen.

2960
02:52:59,520 --> 02:52:59,540
Whoa.

2961
02:53:00,740 --> 02:53:01,960
Yeah, that throat coat.

2962
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:07,080
Adminto and I actually fixed one of these earlier in that
place across the ocean.

2963
02:53:08,980 --> 02:53:11,200
This generator does not need to be fixed right now.

2964
02:53:11,700 --> 02:53:13,260
Right, you guys already have power and all.

2965
02:53:14,340 --> 02:53:15,080
Yeah, but what if?

2966
02:53:16,720 --> 02:53:17,520
The generator.

2967
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:19,320
This one's got a working battery.

2968
02:53:19,580 --> 02:53:20,000
Okay, cool.

2969
02:53:21,300 --> 02:53:22,200
The other place...

2970
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:25,520
This place is actually kept taken care of and not neglected.

2971
02:53:27,720 --> 02:53:29,100
Are you also going to deny me?

2972
02:53:29,560 --> 02:53:30,420
Phosphor trees.

2973
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:32,580
Oh, this is phosphor.

2974
02:53:39,880 --> 02:53:42,080
Yeah, this game does have a lot of dialogue.

2975
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:42,900
That's okay, though.

2976
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:54,340
Okay.

2977
02:53:54,940 --> 02:53:57,780
Phosphor trees are now being protected under new laws.

2978
02:53:59,580 --> 02:54:00,040
Takizawa!

2979
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:02,340
Oh, thank you so much for the thank you, dude.

2980
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:03,060
Thank you.

2981
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:05,700
I'm stuck in a blizzard in Hungary.

2982
02:54:05,880 --> 02:54:06,980
A blizzard?

2983
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:10,880
So you can't order food.

2984
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:27,590
I think you do have to resort to cannibalism.

2985
02:54:29,860 --> 02:54:30,720
Might be the only way.

2986
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:33,760
I would say goldfish.

2987
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:36,280
Cheez-its?

2988
02:54:37,460 --> 02:54:38,820
Cheez-its and goldfish?

2989
02:54:41,620 --> 02:54:44,340
You know, okay, there's just one thing that might be...

2990
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:51,720
friend taught me a while ago this one meal it sounds it's
it's basically a meal for children but sometimes i crave it

2991
02:54:51,720 --> 02:55:01,380
you get the pilsbury crescent rolls not croissant the
crescent rolls and you take them and there you lay them out

2992
02:55:01,380 --> 02:55:10,420
you you peel them apart and they're like little triangles
okay and then you put like maybe uh like maybe like four

2993
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:20,860
pepperoni little like individual and then you take a
mozzarella stick mozzarella cheese stick and you snap it in

2994
02:55:20,860 --> 02:55:31,180
half and you put it on the pepperoni and then you roll it
and then you kind of fold the sides in as well no yeah yeah

2995
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:37,040
it's like a pizza roll basically and then you get the pizza
sauce and you you cook it and then you get the pizza sauce

2996
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:45,320
and then you dip it in there and you make yourself like a
little little individual pizza It's pretty good.

2997
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:50,800
It's better than like a pizza, like the frozen pizza roll
things that you can get.

2998
02:55:51,480 --> 02:55:52,500
It's really good.

2999
02:55:53,700 --> 02:55:56,120
It's my, it's my little, you know.

3000
02:55:56,680 --> 02:56:02,000
It sounds like a meal for children, but it's really yummy.

3001
02:56:03,920 --> 02:56:04,960
Thanks for the foodie app.

3002
02:56:05,100 --> 02:56:05,500
You're amazing.

3003
02:56:05,620 --> 02:56:06,000
I'm going to do it.

3004
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:06,300
Yeah!

3005
02:56:08,380 --> 02:56:10,320
They're really, they're really tasty.

3006
02:56:10,540 --> 02:56:14,040
And it's pretty, you know, you can make a good amount of
them because the crescent rolls.

3007
02:56:14,660 --> 02:56:19,840
They come, I think, like, with 12 or something like that,
so...

3008
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:27,860
And then you just need the mozzarella's cheese stick, and
then you just need the pepperoni, and it's really...

3009
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:29,700
It's not so expensive either, I think.

3010
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:33,620
Meal for adult children, perfect for me!

3011
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:34,180
Yeah!

3012
02:56:37,160 --> 02:56:37,680
Anyway.

3013
02:56:38,680 --> 02:56:40,120
Please do not harvest the trees.

3014
02:56:40,420 --> 02:56:41,040
I'm not?

3015
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:41,540
Okay.

3016
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:43,560
I will not harvest the trees.

3017
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:50,040
Phosphorytree growth rate has been reduced as of late.

3018
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:50,900
Oh no.

3019
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:53,660
That doesn't sound very good.

3020
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:56,440
This whole game seems a little...

3021
02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:58,320
See, we're in the squares!

3022
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:00,640
Monitoring anomaly.

3023
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:02,600
What is that thing?

3024
02:57:03,220 --> 02:57:03,980
An anomaly.

3025
02:57:05,940 --> 02:57:07,600
Well, yeah, but...

3026
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:07,780
Hmm.

3027
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:15,260
Beep poop water collection project resuming.

3028
02:57:16,360 --> 02:57:17,300
He said the thing!

3029
02:57:17,400 --> 02:57:18,100
He said the beep poop!

3030
02:57:18,460 --> 02:57:18,800
He said the beep poop!

3031
02:57:18,820 --> 02:57:19,860
Hello living person.

3032
02:57:20,300 --> 02:57:20,300
Hello.

3033
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:22,720
I have collected a duplicate water sample.

3034
02:57:23,260 --> 02:57:23,780
Would you like it?

3035
02:57:23,900 --> 02:57:24,680
Yeah, sure.

3036
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:31,240
My programming says that organic beings need water to
survive, so I shall offer it to you.

3037
02:57:32,060 --> 02:57:33,060
Oh, sure, I'll take it.

3038
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:37,620
I like how Nico says we, because it's also me here too.

3039
02:57:39,460 --> 02:57:45,540
Stick a dark chocolate in there instead, and that's my
gourmet chocolate-filled croissants, which have won me

3040
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:47,700
lifelong friendships and $80 one time.

3041
02:57:51,130 --> 02:57:52,470
Inside the crescent roll?

3042
02:57:53,810 --> 02:57:54,410
No, why?

3043
02:57:56,930 --> 02:57:58,710
There's a little glass of...

3044
02:57:58,710 --> 02:58:02,410
It's full of little glass tubes of water.

3045
02:58:03,250 --> 02:58:04,150
Oh, water samples!

3046
02:58:07,410 --> 02:58:08,290
Tube of water.

3047
02:58:14,330 --> 02:58:15,970
Those crescent rolls were my childhood.

3048
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:17,210
Sometimes we'd...

3049
02:58:17,210 --> 02:58:18,530
Ah, fireman!

3050
02:58:19,130 --> 02:58:22,350
We'd take the dough and wrap it around a hot dog to make
piggies in a blanket.

3051
02:58:22,550 --> 02:58:24,030
That sounds good!

3052
02:58:24,050 --> 02:58:25,890
That sounds good.

3053
02:58:29,670 --> 02:58:31,470
I think I already went up here.

3054
02:58:32,550 --> 02:58:33,750
I want to make some now!

3055
02:58:35,970 --> 02:58:39,490
I don't think this... I don't think store will still be
open.

3056
02:58:40,350 --> 02:58:43,330
Unfortunately, once I'm done with stream, maybe I'll make
some tomorrow.

3057
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:51,890
Piggy's in a blanket.

3058
02:58:53,490 --> 02:58:54,650
Piggy's in a blanket.

3059
02:58:54,870 --> 02:58:57,390
Wait, I thought we were not supposed to harvest the trees.

3060
02:58:58,490 --> 02:59:01,190
Why are there trees that have been harvested then, huh?

3061
02:59:01,690 --> 02:59:03,770
Ah, that looks illegal activities.

3062
02:59:05,210 --> 02:59:06,970
So we're also looking for a little girl.

3063
02:59:08,110 --> 02:59:09,630
Oh, close that down there.

3064
02:59:12,390 --> 02:59:14,190
Water sample collection in progress.

3065
02:59:16,970 --> 02:59:20,650
My family will put all kinds of things in crescent rolls
like chocolate chips, nuts, cheese, sauce.

3066
02:59:21,150 --> 02:59:21,230
Dang!

3067
02:59:21,730 --> 02:59:22,110
Okay.

3068
02:59:23,430 --> 02:59:24,650
Would you ever make them on stream?

3069
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:27,670
I don't think it'd be so exciting, though.

3070
02:59:27,670 --> 02:59:29,470
but I mean, if you wanted me to.

3071
02:59:34,100 --> 02:59:34,220
Oh!

3072
02:59:35,620 --> 02:59:36,380
The sun.

3073
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:37,680
You are the Messiah.

3074
02:59:38,380 --> 02:59:39,580
Are you on your way to the tower?

3075
02:59:40,280 --> 02:59:40,640
Mm-hmm.

3076
02:59:41,220 --> 02:59:43,000
You can enter the refuge through this wall.

3077
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:45,180
You'll need to sign your name on this scroll first.

3078
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:46,120
All right.

3079
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:47,000
Do you have a pen?

3080
02:59:47,480 --> 02:59:47,880
Um.

3081
02:59:49,460 --> 02:59:49,900
No.

3082
02:59:50,260 --> 02:59:51,120
I've lost mine.

3083
02:59:51,960 --> 02:59:53,540
Perhaps you should look around the Glen for another.

3084
02:59:54,300 --> 02:59:54,660
Okay.

3085
03:00:00,250 --> 03:00:00,690
Interesting.

3086
03:00:02,810 --> 03:00:03,130
Ooh.

3087
03:00:06,190 --> 03:00:06,910
Hello, person.

3088
03:00:07,510 --> 03:00:10,130
Please do note that the ruins below are partially flooded.

3089
03:00:10,750 --> 03:00:12,410
Oh, should we not be here?

3090
03:00:13,070 --> 03:00:14,510
There is no immediate danger.

3091
03:00:15,110 --> 03:00:17,290
Using this area as a dwelling is not recommended, however.

3092
03:00:20,610 --> 03:00:21,910
We just want to hang out with you, Minto.

3093
03:00:24,790 --> 03:00:25,230
No.

3094
03:00:26,190 --> 03:00:28,210
I want to hang out with you guys, too.

3095
03:00:31,670 --> 03:00:32,550
Oh, blinds.

3096
03:00:33,970 --> 03:00:34,930
Vine boom.

3097
03:00:35,290 --> 03:00:38,590
A cluster of vines are blocking the way.

3098
03:00:44,730 --> 03:00:48,030
The sound is so... it's giving Barbie movie.

3099
03:00:50,070 --> 03:00:51,670
With how crisp it is.

3100
03:00:54,430 --> 03:00:55,150
Oh, computer!

3101
03:00:59,210 --> 03:01:01,030
Hello again, Adminto.

3102
03:01:02,010 --> 03:01:03,490
It seems I need to help you again.

3103
03:01:03,590 --> 03:01:05,210
Why does it sound so ominous though?

3104
03:01:05,830 --> 03:01:06,290
I got sick.

3105
03:01:06,370 --> 03:01:07,090
Today is such a Christmas.

3106
03:01:07,230 --> 03:01:08,030
You heal me.

3107
03:01:08,990 --> 03:01:11,170
Go Flarex, feel better!

3108
03:01:13,810 --> 03:01:15,530
Feel better, feel better, feel better!

3109
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:16,670
Minto Energy!

3110
03:01:24,140 --> 03:01:26,020
What prompted me to play OneShot?

3111
03:01:26,580 --> 03:01:27,040
Just curious?

3112
03:01:27,560 --> 03:01:30,480
I don't know, I just, I was curious about it too.

3113
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:34,020
I just remembered the game, basically.

3114
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:39,180
Nico will not be able to progress otherwise.

3115
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:41,880
This time the information you need has fallen to you.

3116
03:01:41,900 --> 03:01:44,340
to the most easily accessible place on your machine.

3117
03:01:46,020 --> 03:01:46,680
Do you see it?

3118
03:01:52,700 --> 03:01:53,100
Uh...

3119
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:54,780
Oh, oh, oh, no.

3120
03:01:57,300 --> 03:02:00,820
I know you're not exactly that bright for a god, Edminto,
but this shouldn't be difficult.

3121
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:04,340
Just poke around a bit, and it really isn't hard to miss.

3122
03:02:05,960 --> 03:02:06,760
My desktop?

3123
03:02:09,260 --> 03:02:10,400
You call me stupid?

3124
03:02:10,400 --> 03:02:14,540
Is it like...

3125
03:02:15,140 --> 03:02:15,560
Hold on.

3126
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:17,600
ViviCorps, thank you so much for the capture!

3127
03:02:18,360 --> 03:02:19,160
Thank you!

3128
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:19,820
Hold on.

3129
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,040
Oh, I'm stupid.

3130
03:02:21,300 --> 03:02:22,480
I'm pressing the wrong thing.

3131
03:02:23,720 --> 03:02:24,060
Documents.

3132
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:26,040
I'm gonna go to downloads.

3133
03:02:30,140 --> 03:02:30,660
Pictures?

3134
03:02:32,460 --> 03:02:33,820
What is the most...

3135
03:02:36,220 --> 03:02:38,780
What is the most accessible place on my PC?

3136
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:41,660
Huh?

3137
03:02:43,180 --> 03:02:44,980
I have literally nothing in here.

3138
03:02:48,500 --> 03:02:49,160
Like...

3139
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:49,620
Pictures?

3140
03:02:51,620 --> 03:02:52,240
Nothing.

3141
03:02:56,380 --> 03:02:58,120
Check the back of the game case.

3142
03:03:01,260 --> 03:03:01,900
Oh, wait.

3143
03:03:06,780 --> 03:03:07,900
I just noticed...

3144
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:08,120
Wait.

3145
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:09,420
Did it turn purple?

3146
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,380
What is this?

3147
03:03:15,540 --> 03:03:17,920
Did it change my wallpaper?

3148
03:03:20,060 --> 03:03:21,600
Oh my god!

3149
03:03:22,520 --> 03:03:23,140
What?

3150
03:03:30,220 --> 03:03:31,600
Oh my god.

3151
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:34,940
It's Orpal.

3152
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:37,320
That's crazy.

3153
03:03:40,360 --> 03:03:42,400
Free wallpaper.

3154
03:03:42,920 --> 03:03:43,600
Wait.

3155
03:03:44,960 --> 03:03:47,400
What was this supposed to be?

3156
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:49,740
Oh.

3157
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:52,560
You remember the document, correct?

3158
03:03:53,060 --> 03:03:54,800
This time it's even more obvious.

3159
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:57,400
What's the most easily accessible place on your machine?

3160
03:03:57,660 --> 03:03:58,480
Yeah, but what is it?

3161
03:04:00,060 --> 03:04:01,400
You will know when.

3162
03:04:01,540 --> 03:04:02,300
Okay, okay.

3163
03:04:05,180 --> 03:04:06,020
That's so funny.

3164
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:08,040
I'm like, what?

3165
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:14,120
What does it do for, like, um...

3166
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:17,820
I know this game is also on, like, console, right?

3167
03:04:18,380 --> 03:04:19,460
I think Switch?

3168
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:19,960
What does it do?

3169
03:04:19,980 --> 03:04:28,480
do in for some of these then these vines appeared mere
minutes ago really i've been seeing a lot of them in

3170
03:04:28,480 --> 03:04:38,960
doorways and stuff oh it uses a virtual machine oh a fake
desktop oh i see i see oh that's what the the version the

3171
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:47,640
like virtual machine version that okay i i see i see i just
assumed it was because this place was abandoned a sign of

3172
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:53,280
distress huh a living being is in need of help, but I cannot
trace the source.

3173
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:55,380
The little girl probably.

3174
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:57,700
Okay, we're running.

3175
03:04:59,340 --> 03:05:00,580
Wait, where did I come from?

3176
03:05:02,740 --> 03:05:05,040
I think I came from up there.

3177
03:05:06,980 --> 03:05:07,580
Hello, person.

3178
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:09,680
Two children reside near here.

3179
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:10,200
Two?

3180
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:11,240
Two of them?

3181
03:05:16,450 --> 03:05:17,870
The pathway is blocked.

3182
03:05:19,590 --> 03:05:21,470
Aminto wrapped 2025.

3183
03:05:22,750 --> 03:05:23,630
Wait, what does that mean?

3184
03:05:23,650 --> 03:05:28,150
You can unlock wallpapers for the fake desktop in-game.

3185
03:05:28,270 --> 03:05:29,050
Oh, that's fine!

3186
03:05:30,810 --> 03:05:31,390
By blocks!

3187
03:05:31,910 --> 03:05:32,950
It's blocked by blocks.

3188
03:05:36,030 --> 03:05:37,990
I thought we weren't supposed to live here.

3189
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:49,400
The music in this game is so good.

3190
03:06:00,970 --> 03:06:01,470
Savior.

3191
03:06:02,670 --> 03:06:03,630
I can't believe it.

3192
03:06:03,750 --> 03:06:04,370
You're real.

3193
03:06:05,330 --> 03:06:05,670
Miss?

3194
03:06:05,670 --> 03:06:17,790
are you all right no we should get you to the village maybe
they could it's okay it's okay too late for me what the sun

3195
03:06:17,790 --> 03:06:27,270
i haven't seen it i haven't felt it in so long savior if
it's not too much trouble can you lend me the sun for a

3196
03:06:27,270 --> 03:06:41,230
while but will it make you better no it will not save me
experience the sun one more time before I, well, oh, would

3197
03:06:41,230 --> 03:06:43,670
it, would it be too selfish of me to ask?

3198
03:06:50,450 --> 03:06:53,830
What should I do, Admin, to give her the sun?

3199
03:06:55,110 --> 03:06:55,430
Here!

3200
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:01,960
I have almost forgotten.

3201
03:07:02,680 --> 03:07:03,520
It's so warm.

3202
03:07:04,480 --> 03:07:05,480
That's good, right?

3203
03:07:08,760 --> 03:07:09,360
God, no.

3204
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:11,280
I'm not afraid anymore.

3205
03:07:15,120 --> 03:07:16,000
Oh, it's dark.

3206
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:23,480
I didn't realize how dark it was when we don't have the sun.

3207
03:07:32,450 --> 03:07:34,230
But now our hands are free.

3208
03:07:35,330 --> 03:07:41,250
There was, like, that one guy that was, like, come back to
herd my sheep when your hands are free.

3209
03:07:41,930 --> 03:07:43,410
And the vines are gone.

3210
03:07:44,470 --> 03:07:44,670
Oh.

3211
03:07:45,830 --> 03:07:47,010
The vines receded.

3212
03:07:47,770 --> 03:07:48,630
Do you know what happened?

3213
03:07:49,010 --> 03:07:50,270
I found this plant person.

3214
03:07:50,790 --> 03:07:51,950
She was barely holding on.

3215
03:07:52,450 --> 03:07:55,330
I gave her the sun for now, but she said it was too late for
her.

3216
03:07:56,030 --> 03:07:56,490
I understand.

3217
03:07:57,030 --> 03:07:58,350
I need to report this to the city.

3218
03:07:58,710 --> 03:07:58,850
Oh.

3219
03:07:59,270 --> 03:07:59,650
Uh-oh.

3220
03:07:59,730 --> 03:08:00,550
We got a snitch.

3221
03:08:03,770 --> 03:08:04,750
Where am I?

3222
03:08:06,890 --> 03:08:08,190
Oh, how handy.

3223
03:08:13,080 --> 03:08:13,640
Oh, no.

3224
03:08:28,940 --> 03:08:30,640
Your hands are now free.

3225
03:08:31,140 --> 03:08:32,540
Would you like to help me herd my rams?

3226
03:08:32,680 --> 03:08:34,580
It's a great reward in store for you, I promise.

3227
03:08:35,900 --> 03:08:38,460
To the south is a peninsula inhabited by my rams.

3228
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:41,520
They are all standing in unfortunate spots.

3229
03:08:41,640 --> 03:08:43,220
You need to move them onto the darker moss.

3230
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:46,720
If you get stuck, ring a bell and they'll all return to
their original positions.

3231
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:47,560
Good luck.

3232
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:49,000
Wait, so down here?

3233
03:08:50,320 --> 03:08:50,680
This?

3234
03:08:54,340 --> 03:08:54,700
This?

3235
03:09:08,370 --> 03:09:11,290
It's a puzzle.

3236
03:09:12,790 --> 03:09:15,690
It's a puzzle.

3237
03:09:19,210 --> 03:09:20,610
Oh,

3238
03:09:26,070 --> 03:09:28,370
I think I get it though.

3239
03:09:30,130 --> 03:09:30,330
Oh,

3240
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:45,040
no!

3241
03:09:45,580 --> 03:09:47,960
I just realized I trapped...

3242
03:09:47,960 --> 03:09:48,180
Wait.

3243
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:50,960
Why can't I just pick up these dang?

3244
03:09:51,140 --> 03:09:51,820
Oh my god.

3245
03:09:55,250 --> 03:09:57,130
It's like a strength boulder puzzle in Pokemon.

3246
03:09:57,290 --> 03:09:58,130
It really is!

3247
03:10:01,710 --> 03:10:03,590
I just realized I messed up.

3248
03:10:05,050 --> 03:10:06,010
Oh no!

3249
03:10:06,610 --> 03:10:08,510
I don't want them all to return.

3250
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:14,310
Oh.

3251
03:10:16,150 --> 03:10:17,210
There's no saving.

3252
03:10:20,410 --> 03:10:21,090
Ding-a-ling!

3253
03:10:52,780 --> 03:10:56,360
Now I have it.

3254
03:11:20,250 --> 03:11:23,770
Well, you've provided a great service for all of Ramkind.

3255
03:11:24,110 --> 03:11:26,050
In return, take this fine Ram war.

3256
03:11:26,690 --> 03:11:27,630
Oh, thanks.

3257
03:11:29,310 --> 03:11:29,910
This guy?

3258
03:11:30,910 --> 03:11:31,890
What about him?

3259
03:11:32,410 --> 03:11:33,650
You're heading to the city, aren't you?

3260
03:11:34,490 --> 03:11:35,050
Been there.

3261
03:11:35,230 --> 03:11:35,690
Done that.

3262
03:11:35,990 --> 03:11:36,770
Too cramped, you know.

3263
03:11:37,710 --> 03:11:39,310
It's cramping my style.

3264
03:11:40,150 --> 03:11:43,210
But it's not like this place is getting any bigger with the
rising waters and all.

3265
03:11:44,070 --> 03:11:45,850
Maybe the city isn't so bad after all.

3266
03:11:47,850 --> 03:11:49,990
So do we take this?

3267
03:11:51,210 --> 03:11:51,370
Wool.

3268
03:11:51,750 --> 03:11:52,730
It's kind of useless.

3269
03:11:52,950 --> 03:11:56,110
Do we trade this then for something else?

3270
03:11:57,910 --> 03:11:58,450
Want to trade?

3271
03:11:58,930 --> 03:11:59,130
Yeah.

3272
03:11:59,510 --> 03:12:00,430
Is there anything you want to get rid of?

3273
03:12:00,670 --> 03:12:01,110
Make an offer.

3274
03:12:01,430 --> 03:12:01,670
Okay.

3275
03:12:05,830 --> 03:12:07,490
I think I have something I'd like to trade.

3276
03:12:08,210 --> 03:12:09,570
You'll take wool, right?

3277
03:12:10,870 --> 03:12:12,670
What can this wool get me?

3278
03:12:13,250 --> 03:12:13,890
Wool, huh?

3279
03:12:16,090 --> 03:12:18,390
That'll get you this fine vial of.

3280
03:12:19,250 --> 03:12:19,930
I'm not sure what this is at.

3281
03:12:22,470 --> 03:12:25,450
A vial of mysterious liquid?

3282
03:12:25,950 --> 03:12:27,550
Some sort of fabric dye.

3283
03:12:29,330 --> 03:12:30,530
I'll take it.

3284
03:12:30,750 --> 03:12:31,450
I'll do it.

3285
03:12:31,670 --> 03:12:32,690
Pleasure doing business!

3286
03:12:35,170 --> 03:12:36,510
Bottle of dye.

3287
03:12:37,710 --> 03:12:39,230
For dyeing wool.

3288
03:12:39,750 --> 03:12:41,290
But I don't have the wool anymore.

3289
03:12:42,110 --> 03:12:42,710
Wait a second.

3290
03:12:43,710 --> 03:12:45,890
What if I use it on that guy that's spinning around?

3291
03:12:51,190 --> 03:12:53,010
Dang, I thought I was gonna...

3292
03:12:53,010 --> 03:12:53,890
I

3293
03:12:57,470 --> 03:13:02,250
can't remember anything that I need to do except find that
little girl.

3294
03:13:04,030 --> 03:13:07,730
And also, whatever my wallpaper is now.

3295
03:13:09,970 --> 03:13:11,590
You must perform the ritual.

3296
03:13:12,970 --> 03:13:14,610
They're so well-behaved.

3297
03:13:15,630 --> 03:13:17,650
It's on their individual spot.

3298
03:13:23,420 --> 03:13:25,040
I just gave that to you.

3299
03:13:25,180 --> 03:13:25,280
Oh.

3300
03:13:25,820 --> 03:13:26,660
You want to trade it back?

3301
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:40,900
really good because i wasn't gonna okay i can't remember if
i've wandered if i've like oh wait uh if i've what places i

03:13:52,780 --> 03:13:55,220

03:14:01,580 --> 03:14:04,180
wait is this still blocked Yes.

3305
03:14:06,040 --> 03:14:07,080
Blocked by blocks?

3306
03:14:12,390 --> 03:14:15,590
The sound of the shoes is way too, like...

3307
03:14:15,590 --> 03:14:16,770
Way too crispy.

3308
03:14:17,010 --> 03:14:17,910
It sounds so good.

3309
03:14:18,350 --> 03:14:20,110
It's impossible to find a place you haven't been to.

3310
03:14:20,870 --> 03:14:21,990
I guess that's fair.

3311
03:14:24,750 --> 03:14:25,630
It's the sun.

3312
03:14:26,050 --> 03:14:27,210
We're leaving it with her for now.

3313
03:14:27,390 --> 03:14:27,770
Oh, okay.

3314
03:14:28,190 --> 03:14:28,570
Just kidding.

3315
03:14:28,930 --> 03:14:29,910
I don't come get it.

3316
03:14:32,210 --> 03:14:33,210
Oh, my bad.

3317
03:14:39,460 --> 03:14:40,260
Thank you!

3318
03:14:41,020 --> 03:14:42,280
Are you guys ready for the good ASMR?

3319
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:43,960
I'll even turn it up.

3320
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:45,020
Listen to this.

3321
03:15:12,850 --> 03:15:14,630
Wait a second, oh, because...

3322
03:15:17,130 --> 03:15:17,930
What areas?

3323
03:15:19,750 --> 03:15:20,150
Uh...

3324
03:15:20,150 --> 03:15:21,470
Oh, this is the computer.

3325
03:15:21,910 --> 03:15:21,910
Okay.

3326
03:15:22,530 --> 03:15:23,930
I wonder if I ask again.

3327
03:15:24,930 --> 03:15:25,770
Are you gonna get mad at me?

3328
03:15:26,290 --> 03:15:27,790
By the way, the effect is temporary.

3329
03:15:28,310 --> 03:15:30,250
It will be gone once you no longer need it.

3330
03:15:30,790 --> 03:15:32,210
Okay, thank you.

3331
03:15:34,690 --> 03:15:36,630
It's like, um, excuse me?

3332
03:15:38,190 --> 03:15:39,270
Um, I'm scared.

3333
03:15:43,090 --> 03:15:43,970
Did I come out?

3334
03:15:44,130 --> 03:15:45,090
Did I...

3335
03:15:48,970 --> 03:15:50,470
Oh, what's this?

3336
03:15:53,830 --> 03:15:55,710
Okay, it must be this then.

3337
03:15:55,870 --> 03:15:57,950
Ah, I see, I see.

3338
03:16:00,650 --> 03:16:01,890
Uh, where's my mouse?

3339
03:16:03,070 --> 03:16:03,270
Oh.

3340
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:08,220
Okay, that should be easy enough.

3341
03:16:09,080 --> 03:16:10,400
One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

3342
03:16:10,660 --> 03:16:11,600
Okay.

3343
03:16:12,760 --> 03:16:13,920
Come back.

3344
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:20,480
One, two, three.

3345
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:24,360
One, two, three.

3346
03:16:25,720 --> 03:16:26,120
Oh, wait.

3347
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:26,860
This might be it.

3348
03:16:28,480 --> 03:16:29,500
Oh, wait.

3349
03:16:41,430 --> 03:16:42,570
Oh, whoops.

3350
03:16:48,850 --> 03:16:49,610
Oh, whoops.

3351
03:16:50,850 --> 03:16:55,150
Oh, we found her!

3352
03:16:55,850 --> 03:16:57,170
He saved me!

3353
03:16:57,910 --> 03:16:58,470
Thank you.

3354
03:16:58,490 --> 03:17:00,910
I was trapped in there for so long.

3355
03:17:02,030 --> 03:17:03,030
So are you Alula?

3356
03:17:04,630 --> 03:17:05,970
You knew my name?

3357
03:17:07,170 --> 03:17:09,230
Wow, the Messiah really does know everything.

3358
03:17:10,210 --> 03:17:12,030
Actually, I just met your brother earlier.

3359
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:13,050
Alright.

3360
03:17:13,710 --> 03:17:16,110
Gosh, Calamus must be so worried.

3361
03:17:16,530 --> 03:17:17,370
Can he bring me to him?

3362
03:17:18,830 --> 03:17:19,250
Okay.

3363
03:17:20,390 --> 03:17:22,710
Oh yeah, my wallpaper really did change back.

3364
03:17:23,890 --> 03:17:24,410
Crazy.

3365
03:17:25,310 --> 03:17:26,010
Alright, come on.

3366
03:17:26,390 --> 03:17:27,370
She's not following me.

3367
03:17:27,810 --> 03:17:28,050
Uh-oh.

3368
03:17:28,490 --> 03:17:29,490
Where are you going?

3369
03:17:30,330 --> 03:17:30,870
I'm leaving.

3370
03:17:32,070 --> 03:17:32,730
Where are you going?

3371
03:17:33,530 --> 03:17:33,930
Wait a minute.

3372
03:17:34,130 --> 03:17:35,590
How did you know that I was the Messiah?

3373
03:17:36,470 --> 03:17:37,770
I don't have the sun with me.

3374
03:17:38,230 --> 03:17:39,050
Your eyes.

3375
03:17:39,550 --> 03:17:41,770
They reminded me of the sun.

3376
03:17:43,270 --> 03:17:44,130
So cute.

3377
03:17:44,430 --> 03:17:45,570
She's so cute.

3378
03:17:47,470 --> 03:17:49,790
Oh, that's why you're our Messiah, right?

3379
03:17:50,490 --> 03:17:51,770
Well, I...

3380
03:17:51,770 --> 03:17:54,450
A lot of people back in my home world have eyes like mine.

3381
03:17:55,650 --> 03:17:56,650
Home world.

3382
03:17:57,410 --> 03:17:57,730
Yeah.

3383
03:17:58,490 --> 03:17:59,710
I'm actually from another world, you see.

3384
03:18:00,410 --> 03:18:02,870
It's a place where the sun is in the sky and not in a tower.

3385
03:18:03,690 --> 03:18:04,850
Do you like this world, too?

3386
03:18:06,010 --> 03:18:06,810
Uh, yeah.

3387
03:18:07,750 --> 03:18:08,110
Yay!

3388
03:18:09,010 --> 03:18:12,750
Callimus says, keep saying how this world is getting more
dangerous by the minute.

3389
03:18:13,430 --> 03:18:13,890
That's okay.

3390
03:18:14,110 --> 03:18:14,790
You're here now.

3391
03:18:15,530 --> 03:18:16,790
You can make everything better.

3392
03:18:19,430 --> 03:18:19,790
Yeah.

3393
03:18:20,350 --> 03:18:21,230
She's so cute.

3394
03:18:25,430 --> 03:18:26,990
I like how she was like, where are you going?

3395
03:18:27,530 --> 03:18:28,550
Why don't you follow me?

3396
03:18:28,870 --> 03:18:29,270
Yeah.

3397
03:18:32,130 --> 03:18:33,950
Okay, so I think we go up here.

3398
03:18:34,870 --> 03:18:36,770
I think we go through here?

3399
03:18:39,090 --> 03:18:39,450
Yes.

3400
03:18:41,090 --> 03:18:42,730
And now we are back in the forest.

3401
03:18:42,990 --> 03:18:43,810
Okay, yes.

3402
03:18:44,370 --> 03:18:45,950
So now we go find the big brother.

3403
03:18:47,610 --> 03:18:49,950
Big bro, big bro, big bro, big bro.

3404
03:18:50,130 --> 03:18:50,970
What's this?

3405
03:18:51,450 --> 03:18:51,990
A bed!

3406
03:18:52,270 --> 03:18:52,590
Uh-oh.

3407
03:18:52,710 --> 03:18:53,870
It's gonna make me sleep again.

3408
03:18:54,010 --> 03:18:54,750
It's gonna be like, you know what?

3409
03:18:54,810 --> 03:18:55,290
I'm sleeping.

3410
03:18:55,710 --> 03:18:56,670
Before we go to the city.

3411
03:19:02,950 --> 03:19:03,170
Oh!

3412
03:19:05,370 --> 03:19:05,770
Calimus!

3413
03:19:06,550 --> 03:19:06,950
Alula!

3414
03:19:07,770 --> 03:19:08,410
You're okay!

3415
03:19:09,370 --> 03:19:09,750
The bed?

3416
03:19:10,010 --> 03:19:10,190
Okay.

3417
03:19:12,070 --> 03:19:12,870
Thank goodness.

3418
03:19:14,370 --> 03:19:16,770
She was in that room for three days, isn't that what he
said?

3419
03:19:17,190 --> 03:19:21,450
I was trapped inside this room and it was really scary, but
then the Messiah saved me.

3420
03:19:21,810 --> 03:19:22,150
Trapped?

3421
03:19:22,630 --> 03:19:23,190
In the ruins?

3422
03:19:23,810 --> 03:19:24,210
Yeah.

3423
03:19:25,970 --> 03:19:27,670
There was that weird stuff on the door.

3424
03:19:28,250 --> 03:19:30,910
You know, the floating squares we see next to the ocean
sometimes.

3425
03:19:31,530 --> 03:19:32,910
The stuff you told me to stay away from.

3426
03:19:32,950 --> 03:19:45,370
what it's spread to the ruins now this isn't good don't
worry i didn't touch it her face is so cute i like her face

3427
03:19:45,370 --> 03:20:00,520
i'm not hurt or anything still if it gets any worse we might
have to find somewhere else to live what is this square

3428
03:20:00,520 --> 03:20:09,060
stuff exactly bad there's an allula plush on the store i did
see when I was looking at the game on Steam that they were

3429
03:20:09,060 --> 03:20:10,900
like, get the stuff in the store.

3430
03:20:11,100 --> 03:20:12,260
Like, it's a...

3431
03:20:12,260 --> 03:20:13,480
This game is old, no?

3432
03:20:14,840 --> 03:20:16,240
This game is pretty old.

3433
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:20,780
Anything that touches them just sort of gets messed up.

3434
03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:25,280
Whenever you hear people say that the world is decaying,
that's what they meant.

3435
03:20:25,960 --> 03:20:27,220
Obviously, you should avoid them too.

3436
03:20:27,860 --> 03:20:28,240
I will.

3437
03:20:28,740 --> 03:20:30,100
Yeah, almost 10 years.

3438
03:20:32,180 --> 03:20:32,660
2016.

3439
03:20:34,240 --> 03:20:36,220
We're close to...

3440
03:20:37,200 --> 03:20:39,660
We're just a couple days away from 2026.

3441
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:46,140
Is there anything you guys want to do in the last couple of
days of 2025?

3442
03:20:47,420 --> 03:20:48,840
Honestly, though, as a ghost.

3443
03:20:50,820 --> 03:20:53,580
The years don't really feel very, very different.

3444
03:20:54,520 --> 03:21:00,320
You know, like, when it changes to a new year, it doesn't
really feel so different.

3445
03:21:04,860 --> 03:21:06,120
Watch me, though.

3446
03:21:08,400 --> 03:21:24,120
I think I I kind of want to do It's not like exactly a
countdown But I will be streaming On 31st And then And then

3447
03:21:24,120 --> 03:21:38,960
I actually have two streams On the 31st But one of them is I
think PST time So So Yeah, 2.

3448
03:21:41,260 --> 03:21:43,680
Feels wrong saying 2016 will be a decade ago.

3449
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:44,480
I know!

3450
03:21:46,280 --> 03:21:47,240
Because 2016...

3451
03:21:47,240 --> 03:21:48,880
It's kind of insane, right?

3452
03:21:48,960 --> 03:21:51,920
I'm like, if I think 2016, I'm like, oh my gosh, that feels
recent.

3453
03:21:52,800 --> 03:21:53,800
But it's not.

3454
03:21:55,180 --> 03:21:56,420
Oh, Doki announced it already?

3455
03:21:56,580 --> 03:21:57,060
Oh, okay.

3456
03:21:58,220 --> 03:21:59,980
Doki didn't leak anything.

3457
03:22:00,100 --> 03:22:00,860
It's her event.

3458
03:22:02,600 --> 03:22:06,420
But yeah, there will be a sloppy sister's countdown on...

3459
03:22:06,440 --> 03:22:08,160
the 31st.

3460
03:22:08,860 --> 03:22:10,480
So, yeah!

3461
03:22:11,380 --> 03:22:13,060
Yeah, we'll be hanging out together.

3462
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:18,660
But I will not be streaming my side, so I apologize in
advance.

3463
03:22:20,180 --> 03:22:21,420
Alrighty, 1.20 a.m.

3464
03:22:21,420 --> 03:22:22,100
time for me to go to bed.

3465
03:22:22,600 --> 03:22:22,900
Good night!

3466
03:22:23,460 --> 03:22:23,940
Scratch!

3467
03:22:24,400 --> 03:22:24,680
Good night!

3468
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:25,140
Good night!

3469
03:22:25,480 --> 03:22:25,920
Thank you.

3470
03:22:26,780 --> 03:22:29,520
Good night.

3471
03:22:29,660 --> 03:22:31,700
I hope I adore it.

3472
03:22:42,260 --> 03:22:47,100
But I won't be streaming it because it's like, Uh...

3473
03:22:47,100 --> 03:22:50,640
I've been having issues with VR, so I'm like...

3474
03:22:50,640 --> 03:22:52,540
I don't think I should stream.

3475
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:55,420
I apologize in advance.

3476
03:22:58,840 --> 03:22:59,960
Oh, that's what he says too.

3477
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:00,460
Anyway.

3478
03:23:01,540 --> 03:23:04,160
I can't thank you enough for rescuing my sister, Savior.

3479
03:23:05,260 --> 03:23:06,160
Just call me Nico.

3480
03:23:09,020 --> 03:23:09,540
Oh gosh.

3481
03:23:09,980 --> 03:23:11,520
Would it not be rude to call you by name?

3482
03:23:12,660 --> 03:23:13,100
Huh?

3483
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:13,940
Why would it be?

3484
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:16,560
I mean, I'm just a kid like you guys.

3485
03:23:17,820 --> 03:23:19,840
Then, would you like to visit our house?

3486
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:22,000
Yes.

3487
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:24,100
Yay!

3488
03:23:24,820 --> 03:23:25,500
Let's go.

3489
03:23:28,020 --> 03:23:29,720
I'm going to their home.

3490
03:23:31,240 --> 03:23:31,640
Oh!

3491
03:23:32,020 --> 03:23:33,720
This is where they live!

3492
03:23:33,840 --> 03:23:34,440
In the ruins.

3493
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:35,180
Oh, shoot.

3494
03:23:35,520 --> 03:23:37,000
Looks like we can't get past that block.

3495
03:23:37,340 --> 03:23:38,100
It's just a block.

3496
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:39,840
How was your Christmas?

3497
03:23:39,980 --> 03:23:40,680
It was good!

3498
03:23:40,780 --> 03:23:41,720
How was yours, Jacob?

3499
03:23:44,700 --> 03:23:45,100
Seriously?

3500
03:23:48,800 --> 03:23:50,660
I'll be up ahead.

3501
03:23:51,660 --> 03:23:53,760
I literally never thought of that.

3502
03:23:54,800 --> 03:23:57,400
You kind of get used to all the debris after living here for
a while.

3503
03:23:57,980 --> 03:23:59,240
Come on, our house isn't far from here.

3504
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:03,380
Um, Nico.

3505
03:24:04,640 --> 03:24:05,520
Nico stupid.

3506
03:24:07,980 --> 03:24:09,140
Welcome to our home.

3507
03:24:10,200 --> 03:24:12,880
I know it's not much, but feel free to make yourself
comfortable.

3508
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:16,240
Ah, there it is!

3509
03:24:19,100 --> 03:24:20,660
Here, we want you to have this.

3510
03:24:21,100 --> 03:24:21,680
What is it?

3511
03:24:23,300 --> 03:24:23,780
It's...

3512
03:24:23,780 --> 03:24:24,060
Oh!

3513
03:24:27,440 --> 03:24:27,920
Cute!

3514
03:24:30,280 --> 03:24:31,360
Oh, it's a feather.

3515
03:24:32,300 --> 03:24:33,620
The edges are glowing yellow.

3516
03:24:34,460 --> 03:24:37,080
It's a sacred feather from the great prophet.

3517
03:24:38,160 --> 03:24:38,400
Oh?

3518
03:24:39,140 --> 03:24:39,620
Yeah.

3519
03:24:40,420 --> 03:24:42,280
She's this old lady our dad used to know.

3520
03:24:42,900 --> 03:24:44,160
Her feathers can glow in the dark.

3521
03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:47,440
She can see into the future.

3522
03:24:48,380 --> 03:24:49,660
Now I can double jump.

3523
03:24:50,120 --> 03:24:50,680
Yippee!

3524
03:24:53,300 --> 03:24:53,860
What?

3525
03:24:54,500 --> 03:24:55,440
Or something like that.

3526
03:24:56,300 --> 03:24:58,700
She gave one of her feathers to father before she died.

3527
03:25:02,800 --> 03:25:05,440
Door draws a move.

3528
03:25:06,660 --> 03:25:07,780
Wherever tell.

3529
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:09,080
Welcome to a bamboo ship!

3530
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:12,600
Thank you!

3531
03:25:13,600 --> 03:25:20,900
Father wanted to pass this down as a an heirloom although it
feels more fitting for you to have it are you sure totally

3532
03:25:20,900 --> 03:25:32,920
sure i think that's what our father would have wanted thank
you glowing feather fireflies you would not believe your

3533
03:25:32,920 --> 03:25:41,540
eyes you would not believe your eyes it's good to be home
again oh by the way what happened to the sun i lent it to

3534
03:25:41,540 --> 03:25:47,260
someone in the ruins she said she wanted to feel the sun
again before she Oh, you must be talking about maize.

3535
03:25:51,580 --> 03:25:52,260
Is that her name?

3536
03:25:52,960 --> 03:25:54,300
She's a powerful plant spirit.

3537
03:25:54,600 --> 03:25:55,720
She used to protect the Glen.

3538
03:25:56,440 --> 03:25:59,100
But once the sun died, her health rapidly deteriorated.

3539
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:00,180
Oh.

3540
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:02,560
Corn.

3541
03:26:03,620 --> 03:26:05,880
I'm glad you were able to find her in time.

3542
03:26:06,540 --> 03:26:08,660
I think we might already be too late to save her.

3543
03:26:09,320 --> 03:26:09,740
I know.

3544
03:26:10,380 --> 03:26:12,080
But I'm glad she got to see the sun again.

3545
03:26:15,200 --> 03:26:16,320
There's so much back here.

3546
03:26:19,340 --> 03:26:20,420
Wait, there's three beds.

3547
03:26:22,220 --> 03:26:23,240
There's one for their papa.

3548
03:26:23,560 --> 03:26:25,420
The back room is full of dust and cobwebs.

3549
03:26:26,800 --> 03:26:28,360
Aw, there's three, though.

3550
03:26:29,120 --> 03:26:30,580
Zantos, welcome to Membushup.

3551
03:26:30,820 --> 03:26:31,200
Thank you!

3552
03:26:39,130 --> 03:26:39,570
Oh!

3553
03:26:43,680 --> 03:26:45,180
I saw you going to the courtyard.

3554
03:26:45,860 --> 03:26:47,020
So I thought I'd tag along.

3555
03:26:47,640 --> 03:26:47,880
Same.

3556
03:26:52,280 --> 03:26:53,480
This area is so cute.

3557
03:26:55,020 --> 03:26:55,620
Ball.

3558
03:26:56,400 --> 03:26:56,920
It's a ball.

3559
03:26:57,700 --> 03:26:58,440
That's my.

3560
03:26:59,140 --> 03:27:00,960
It doesn't bounce as much as it used to, though.

3561
03:27:02,300 --> 03:27:02,980
What are these?

3562
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:04,040
Fish.

3563
03:27:05,140 --> 03:27:05,620
Fish!

3564
03:27:08,100 --> 03:27:10,740
How can we protect without our tiny souls?

3565
03:27:10,900 --> 03:27:11,240
Stop.

3566
03:27:11,300 --> 03:27:12,120
Don't say that.

3567
03:27:16,040 --> 03:27:16,640
Don't

3568
03:27:22,140 --> 03:27:22,740
mention...

3569
03:27:22,740 --> 03:27:23,620
Just continues.

3570
03:27:24,040 --> 03:27:25,580
Oh, magic trick.

3571
03:27:27,880 --> 03:27:29,680
It looks like this used to lead somewhere.

3572
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:32,880
Heaven's division

3573
03:27:39,150 --> 03:27:45,690
Yeah, the sacred grounds It's been a while since we went
there We don't have a way of getting there now, remember Can

3574
03:27:45,690 --> 03:27:46,590
they not swim?

3575
03:27:48,870 --> 03:28:01,250
There isn't a boat And none of us can swim Well, the game
totally answered my question What's the sacred grounds?

3576
03:28:01,810 --> 03:28:05,370
It's where our people are buried Sometimes we go there to
visit mom.

3577
03:28:06,090 --> 03:28:07,010
Well, her grave anyway.

3578
03:28:08,470 --> 03:28:08,690
No.

3579
03:28:09,450 --> 03:28:11,310
Wait, how do you get there?

3580
03:28:12,010 --> 03:28:13,170
I thought you said there isn't a boat.

3581
03:28:13,970 --> 03:28:15,090
Oh, our friend helps us.

3582
03:28:15,690 --> 03:28:17,610
There's some sort of machine that allows him to fly.

3583
03:28:18,430 --> 03:28:19,550
Sometimes he takes us along.

3584
03:28:21,010 --> 03:28:24,010
But like I was about to say, we haven't seen him around me
for a while.

3585
03:28:24,630 --> 03:28:25,850
I wonder when he'll come back.

3586
03:28:26,410 --> 03:28:27,770
I wish we could go see mom again.

3587
03:28:30,130 --> 03:28:31,390
This is so sad.

3588
03:28:36,370 --> 03:28:38,250
Let's go back to the courtyard now.

3589
03:28:39,430 --> 03:28:40,430
The audio is delayed.

3590
03:28:42,650 --> 03:28:43,350
Like from the game?

3591
03:28:49,620 --> 03:28:50,100
Is it okay?

3592
03:28:52,940 --> 03:28:53,920
Audio is okay?

3593
03:28:55,800 --> 03:28:56,760
Might just be me.

3594
03:28:58,240 --> 03:28:58,720
Uh oh.

3595
03:29:06,850 --> 03:29:07,450
Funky.

3596
03:29:09,370 --> 03:29:11,510
Funky, funky, funky night!

3597
03:29:11,890 --> 03:29:13,250
Poop is a poo poo.

3598
03:29:13,410 --> 03:29:15,250
Funky, funky, funky night.

3599
03:29:20,470 --> 03:29:21,450
Are you leaving now?

3600
03:29:21,790 --> 03:29:22,750
It was nice to meet you.

3601
03:29:23,330 --> 03:29:24,110
Really, thanks for everything.

3602
03:29:25,170 --> 03:29:25,350
Aww.

3603
03:29:28,210 --> 03:29:28,950
Are you leaving now?

3604
03:29:29,050 --> 03:29:29,670
Good luck, Nico.

3605
03:29:30,390 --> 03:29:31,250
We believe in you.

3606
03:29:32,750 --> 03:29:34,050
This game is so sweet.

3607
03:29:34,450 --> 03:29:37,030
It's so sad, but everybody's so nice.

3608
03:29:42,790 --> 03:29:44,410
Alright, let's go get our son back.

3609
03:29:46,970 --> 03:29:48,330
Our son should be down here.

3610
03:29:48,350 --> 03:29:49,890
my son

3611
03:29:53,630 --> 03:30:03,770
we also now have this feather with glowing edges oh I wonder
if we can use the dye and the feather like an ink to sign

3612
03:30:03,770 --> 03:30:05,270
our name

3613
03:30:10,090 --> 03:30:15,070
wait the light's gone out and Minto?

3614
03:30:16,090 --> 03:30:16,670
did you know what happened?

3615
03:30:17,830 --> 03:30:18,090
no

3616
03:30:21,590 --> 03:30:23,850
Oh, what am I gonna do?

3617
03:30:24,750 --> 03:30:25,930
Oh, it's back on.

3618
03:30:28,130 --> 03:30:29,290
It lit up again.

3619
03:30:30,110 --> 03:30:30,290
Phew.

3620
03:30:33,790 --> 03:30:34,490
She's gone.

3621
03:30:35,390 --> 03:30:37,390
Oh, there's something on the ground here.

3622
03:30:38,310 --> 03:30:39,150
It looks like a kernel.

3623
03:30:41,330 --> 03:30:42,990
A kernel of corn.

3624
03:30:43,670 --> 03:30:46,410
She must have left it, but she really was.

3625
03:30:46,630 --> 03:30:47,710
She was corn.

3626
03:30:49,270 --> 03:30:50,650
She was corn.

3627
03:30:53,030 --> 03:30:53,470
Colonel.

3628
03:30:54,490 --> 03:30:55,950
She must have left it behind.

3629
03:31:00,360 --> 03:31:01,240
A seed.

3630
03:31:01,800 --> 03:31:03,940
It's a seed apparently left behind by maize.

3631
03:31:04,340 --> 03:31:05,880
Wait, can we go plant it?

3632
03:31:17,610 --> 03:31:18,230
Let's see.

3633
03:31:18,370 --> 03:31:20,690
There was that area where the crops were.

3634
03:31:21,270 --> 03:31:22,730
Let's go see if we can plant it.

3635
03:31:24,790 --> 03:31:25,850
How do I get out of here?

3636
03:31:27,110 --> 03:31:28,190
Wait, I think I remember.

3637
03:31:29,630 --> 03:31:30,410
Right here.

3638
03:31:36,950 --> 03:31:37,570
Oh, wait.

3639
03:31:39,610 --> 03:31:45,970
Wait, where- oh no, the vines were- sorry, I was not- I was
thinking of- I thought this was the area with the vines.

3640
03:31:46,170 --> 03:31:46,490
I'm stupid.

3641
03:31:48,570 --> 03:31:49,810
Mays is corn in Spanish.

3642
03:31:50,130 --> 03:31:50,870
Yeah, exactly!

3643
03:31:51,010 --> 03:31:51,950
She is corn!

3644
03:31:53,830 --> 03:31:55,610
She is- she was corn!

3645
03:31:56,290 --> 03:31:59,990
I thought it was just a silly name that they gave her, but
it's real.

3646
03:32:03,250 --> 03:32:05,150
I wonder if I can trade her corn.

3647
03:32:19,310 --> 03:32:20,790
I've been growing poorly without the sun.

3648
03:32:20,890 --> 03:32:21,990
There's no telling how long our surplus.

3649
03:32:22,310 --> 03:32:22,990
You have to hurry.

3650
03:32:23,590 --> 03:32:24,470
I'll do my best.

3651
03:32:25,130 --> 03:32:25,950
Can I plant it?

3652
03:32:26,170 --> 03:32:27,050
Can I plant it?

3653
03:32:27,750 --> 03:32:28,890
Doesn't look like I can.

3654
03:32:29,690 --> 03:32:31,510
What if you fed the corn to the sheep?

3655
03:32:32,650 --> 03:32:36,090
And then, when it poops it out, it's fertilized.

3656
03:32:37,390 --> 03:32:40,870
And that is the circle of life.

3657
03:32:45,660 --> 03:32:47,840
It's like what happens when birds eat seeds.

3658
03:32:56,060 --> 03:32:56,480
Yes.

3659
03:32:56,920 --> 03:32:58,260
We will fertilize her.

3660
03:33:00,740 --> 03:33:03,840
Oh, I gotta go back inside here.

3661
03:33:03,940 --> 03:33:05,120
We gotta go to the robot.

3662
03:33:18,100 --> 03:33:19,140
Was it this way?

3663
03:33:19,480 --> 03:33:20,040
I think so.

3664
03:33:20,280 --> 03:33:20,460
Yes.

3665
03:33:23,420 --> 03:33:25,080
We're going to the big city.

3666
03:33:26,280 --> 03:33:29,660
I'm going to the big city on my own.

3667
03:33:30,020 --> 03:33:30,240
Oh, wait.

3668
03:33:30,320 --> 03:33:33,520
Let's do feather and then the bottle die.

3669
03:33:34,100 --> 03:33:35,060
We can use the feather as a pen.

3670
03:33:35,160 --> 03:33:35,560
Oh, nice.

3671
03:33:35,920 --> 03:33:37,100
I saw it in a picture book once.

3672
03:33:39,120 --> 03:33:46,740
I don't know if that's the, we're using this like, this,
this magical old lady's feathers who has already passed

3673
03:33:46,740 --> 03:33:47,120
away.

3674
03:33:47,380 --> 03:33:51,860
We're using her, their family heirloom as a pen.

3675
03:33:52,620 --> 03:33:53,420
I guess it works.

3676
03:33:56,640 --> 03:33:58,380
Adminto, I'm too tired to go on right now.

3677
03:33:58,800 --> 03:33:59,900
Please let me not for a bit somewhere.

3678
03:34:00,480 --> 03:34:01,780
I remember seeing a room to the west.

3679
03:34:02,260 --> 03:34:04,000
It looked like it might be a good place to take a rest.

3680
03:34:05,080 --> 03:34:05,460
Okay.

3681
03:34:07,560 --> 03:34:08,840
My game's gonna close.

3682
03:34:12,900 --> 03:34:14,860
I'm a little tired from walking.

3683
03:34:15,640 --> 03:34:16,830
Sorry if I take a nap.

3684
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:18,220
Yes.

3685
03:34:19,640 --> 03:34:20,320
Goodbye, game.

3686
03:34:23,300 --> 03:34:24,860
It's so funny.

3687
03:34:26,020 --> 03:34:26,380
Okay.

3688
03:34:29,080 --> 03:34:31,380
You can see some of my games.

3689
03:34:33,440 --> 03:34:34,180
Play.

3690
03:34:39,160 --> 03:34:40,880
We're dreaming again.

3691
03:34:57,530 --> 03:34:57,890
And...

3692
03:34:57,890 --> 03:34:58,750
So cute.

3693
03:35:07,540 --> 03:35:09,040
I mean, though, I had another dream.

3694
03:35:09,620 --> 03:35:10,380
Did you see this one too?

3695
03:35:11,080 --> 03:35:11,420
Yeah.

3696
03:35:12,280 --> 03:35:14,920
I was in a big field, like the one in my last dream.

3697
03:35:15,520 --> 03:35:16,040
Spicey wolf.

3698
03:35:17,080 --> 03:35:18,160
And I saw my village!

3699
03:35:18,960 --> 03:35:20,280
But then I woke up.

3700
03:35:21,280 --> 03:35:23,240
I don't think this world has anything...

3701
03:35:23,240 --> 03:35:25,000
I don't think this world has anything like that.

3702
03:35:25,620 --> 03:35:26,980
I mean, big wheat fields.

3703
03:35:27,900 --> 03:35:30,280
The only big plants I've seen here are a bunch of weird
trees.

3704
03:35:30,780 --> 03:35:32,940
And those balls of moss floating in the water.

3705
03:35:33,700 --> 03:35:35,500
Wait, is moss even a plant?

3706
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:41,680
Say, have you seen a wheat field before, Adminto?

3707
03:35:42,820 --> 03:35:45,940
Yeah, actually, have I seen a wheat field before?

3708
03:35:48,820 --> 03:35:50,160
I don't know.

3709
03:35:52,680 --> 03:35:53,180
Have I?

3710
03:35:57,950 --> 03:35:59,670
I don't know if I ever have.

3711
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:15,340
If you've been to the Midwest, then yes.

3712
03:36:19,580 --> 03:36:20,800
I don't think so.

3713
03:36:25,140 --> 03:36:26,420
Is it a myth?

3714
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:28,160
I don't know if I've ever seen one.

3715
03:36:29,080 --> 03:36:29,660
I'm going to say no.

3716
03:36:30,700 --> 03:36:32,400
Oh, well, they're really pretty.

3717
03:36:33,260 --> 03:36:34,380
They look like...

3718
03:36:34,380 --> 03:36:35,620
Wait, you just saw one in my dream.

3719
03:36:36,420 --> 03:36:38,480
The one around my village goes around for miles.

3720
03:36:38,960 --> 03:36:39,920
The plants are really tall.

3721
03:36:40,020 --> 03:36:41,320
Sometimes I can't even see through them.

3722
03:36:41,400 --> 03:36:43,340
I don't think I've ever seen a wee fill before.

3723
03:36:47,140 --> 03:36:49,240
Okay, looking out a plane window is...

3724
03:36:49,260 --> 03:36:50,340
It's totally different.

3725
03:36:52,120 --> 03:36:53,940
The wheat is a myth.

3726
03:36:57,030 --> 03:36:57,970
The plants are really tall.

3727
03:36:58,110 --> 03:36:59,390
Sometimes I can't even see through them.

3728
03:37:00,770 --> 03:37:03,010
When it's windy out, the wind can make waves in it.

3729
03:37:03,130 --> 03:37:03,950
I want to see!

3730
03:37:04,990 --> 03:37:08,670
That's my 2026 goal is to see a wheat field.

3731
03:37:09,350 --> 03:37:10,590
I want to see it.

3732
03:37:14,220 --> 03:37:17,200
I don't know if I've seen one either and it's blowing my
brain.

3733
03:37:17,320 --> 03:37:19,000
I know because you think of a wheat field.

3734
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:19,920
You know what it looks like.

3735
03:37:20,020 --> 03:37:22,140
But now I'm like, I've only seen them in movies.

3736
03:37:22,280 --> 03:37:23,860
I've only seen them on TV.

3737
03:37:24,580 --> 03:37:26,760
I've seen them in games, anime.

3738
03:37:27,240 --> 03:37:29,080
I've never seen in real life.

3739
03:37:32,190 --> 03:37:33,190
I've never seen!

3740
03:37:38,180 --> 03:37:41,260
That's my goal, 2026, is to see a wheat field.

3741
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:47,820
Now you're making me question if I've seen one or not.

3742
03:37:48,900 --> 03:37:52,960
I don't think I've ever seen one!

3743
03:37:54,540 --> 03:37:55,700
I'm gonna go see one.

3744
03:37:56,180 --> 03:37:57,040
It's like an ocean.

3745
03:37:57,220 --> 03:37:57,880
A food!

3746
03:37:58,500 --> 03:38:00,680
Oh wait, but there's food in regular oceans too.

3747
03:38:01,220 --> 03:38:02,300
Like fish or crabs.

3748
03:38:02,980 --> 03:38:05,340
I've never actually been to a real ocean until now,
actually.

3749
03:38:06,880 --> 03:38:07,820
I've been to the ocean.

3750
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:08,580
Yeah, I have.

3751
03:38:09,580 --> 03:38:10,940
That's really cool, Adminto.

3752
03:38:11,580 --> 03:38:12,820
I've only seen the ocean on TV.

3753
03:38:13,020 --> 03:38:15,200
This is, see, this is literally me, but with a wheat field.

3754
03:38:17,940 --> 03:38:19,760
Time to drive cross country.

3755
03:38:19,980 --> 03:38:20,420
Yeah!

3756
03:38:21,820 --> 03:38:24,400
I never thought I'd get to ride a boat through one.

3757
03:38:25,080 --> 03:38:28,100
The water back home doesn't have glowy stuff like how it is
here either.

3758
03:38:28,840 --> 03:38:31,760
Ah, but I guess it's because the world is already so dark.

3759
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:36,380
You know, I used to be scared of the dark, Admin, though.

3760
03:38:36,880 --> 03:38:39,720
It's a little hard to imagine that now after spending so
much time here.

3761
03:38:40,380 --> 03:38:42,380
Not long ago, I couldn't even go to sleep without a lamp.

3762
03:38:42,540 --> 03:38:43,020
That's me now.

3763
03:38:43,160 --> 03:38:44,360
I can't go to sleep without a lamp.

3764
03:38:44,820 --> 03:38:45,320
Me too!

3765
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:47,360
Really?

3766
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:48,600
Even though you're a god?

3767
03:38:49,440 --> 03:38:49,760
Yeah.

3768
03:38:50,460 --> 03:38:51,140
Oh my god.

3769
03:38:52,640 --> 03:38:54,460
I can feel my head expanding.

3770
03:38:56,380 --> 03:38:58,120
It's a good thing I got over that fear.

3771
03:38:58,560 --> 03:39:00,080
Otherwise, I wouldn't last long here.

3772
03:39:00,620 --> 03:39:02,960
Then again, I've been carrying around the sun, so it's not
too bad.

3773
03:39:03,820 --> 03:39:06,000
And also, I don't feel scared at all with you guiding me.

3774
03:39:08,140 --> 03:39:08,900
So thanks for that.

3775
03:39:09,600 --> 03:39:11,340
Anyway, maybe I should head out now, Adminto.

3776
03:39:15,130 --> 03:39:18,910
Um, I was told that there is something that I could miss
here.

3777
03:39:23,010 --> 03:39:24,310
Did I miss it?

3778
03:39:29,230 --> 03:39:30,390
I sleep with the TV on.

3779
03:39:30,490 --> 03:39:30,670
I need...

3780
03:39:30,670 --> 03:39:32,070
I sleep with YouTube, yeah.

3781
03:39:36,800 --> 03:39:38,620
Protect this cat, Minto.

3782
03:39:39,240 --> 03:39:39,640
How are you?

3783
03:39:40,740 --> 03:39:43,640
If nobody knows, we'll just continue onwards then.

3784
03:39:45,380 --> 03:39:45,620
Let's see.

3785
03:39:45,800 --> 03:39:48,360
Because I think we'll probably have to get rid of, like, the
tube.

3786
03:39:53,810 --> 03:39:54,850
Have you seen corn?

3787
03:39:57,820 --> 03:39:59,040
I love corn.

3788
03:40:07,550 --> 03:40:10,670
You could have haggled the guy earlier, I think, for extra
wool.

3789
03:40:11,490 --> 03:40:12,530
Oh, no!

3790
03:40:13,350 --> 03:40:14,530
Oh, oops.

3791
03:40:15,270 --> 03:40:16,070
Oh, well.

3792
03:40:20,760 --> 03:40:23,040
Okay, well, we'll just go onwards then.

3793
03:40:26,550 --> 03:40:27,830
Have you found something to write with?

3794
03:40:29,010 --> 03:40:29,310
Yes.

3795
03:40:29,650 --> 03:40:29,810
Oh.

3796
03:40:32,110 --> 03:40:33,190
I found a pen!

3797
03:40:33,570 --> 03:40:33,990
Sort of.

3798
03:40:34,730 --> 03:40:35,130
Good.

3799
03:40:35,550 --> 03:40:36,910
Please write your name here.

3800
03:40:39,450 --> 03:40:41,130
I did the sound effect for me.

3801
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:42,630
Don't worry, you got it.

3802
03:40:42,650 --> 03:40:45,370
There's another thing that could have been gotten if you did
the sheet puzzle.

3803
03:40:45,570 --> 03:40:46,210
Oh, okay, okay.

3804
03:40:47,810 --> 03:40:48,210
Okay.

3805
03:40:50,030 --> 03:40:51,070
Corn is pretty great.

3806
03:40:51,270 --> 03:40:52,390
I like it with a little butter, salt, and pepper.

3807
03:40:52,590 --> 03:40:52,990
Yes!

3808
03:40:54,550 --> 03:40:55,250
I love.

3809
03:40:55,930 --> 03:40:56,490
Good luck.

3810
03:40:58,130 --> 03:40:58,930
Thank you!

3811
03:40:58,930 --> 03:40:59,210
World!

3812
03:41:13,740 --> 03:41:14,300
Uh-oh.

3813
03:41:16,460 --> 03:41:17,200
The anomaly!

3814
03:41:19,500 --> 03:41:21,360
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm
running.

3815
03:41:22,280 --> 03:41:22,760
I'm scared.

3816
03:41:24,680 --> 03:41:25,640
It's kind of loud.

3817
03:41:25,940 --> 03:41:26,520
Does that scare me?

3818
03:41:29,080 --> 03:41:30,380
The big city!

3819
03:41:31,640 --> 03:41:32,120
Wow!

3820
03:41:41,590 --> 03:41:43,250
The sounds are crazy.

3821
03:41:45,970 --> 03:41:46,930
The sun.

3822
03:41:47,910 --> 03:41:48,350
Hello, Messiah.

3823
03:41:48,950 --> 03:41:50,170
Welcome to the refuge.

3824
03:41:50,850 --> 03:41:52,370
Do you understand what you must do here?

3825
03:41:53,170 --> 03:41:54,830
I'm supposed to go inside the tower, right?

3826
03:41:55,630 --> 03:41:57,870
I already see the tower, so I guess we must be close.

3827
03:41:58,630 --> 03:41:59,330
Where's the entrance?

3828
03:42:00,110 --> 03:42:01,030
On the surface.

3829
03:42:02,070 --> 03:42:02,510
The surface?

3830
03:42:06,650 --> 03:42:08,010
Look down, small one.

3831
03:42:08,490 --> 03:42:10,190
Whoa, we're pretty high up.

3832
03:42:10,950 --> 03:42:12,590
I guess I gotta get down a lot of stairs.

3833
03:42:13,150 --> 03:42:13,950
We're finding an elevator.

3834
03:42:15,930 --> 03:42:17,470
However, the tower is a sacred place.

3835
03:42:18,210 --> 03:42:21,350
Finding the entrance may be easy, but that alone will not be
enough.

3836
03:42:22,250 --> 03:42:23,090
What do you mean?

3837
03:42:24,690 --> 03:42:28,510
Once you reach the surface, I recommend visiting the library
for leads.

3838
03:42:29,430 --> 03:42:30,410
Alright, thank you.

3839
03:42:30,490 --> 03:42:31,770
You mean I gotta read?

3840
03:42:36,460 --> 03:42:38,680
Nico's afraid of ladders, but not heights.

3841
03:42:41,500 --> 03:42:42,780
I think I get it, though.

3842
03:42:43,520 --> 03:42:44,820
Ladders are kind of unsteady.

3843
03:42:46,520 --> 03:42:48,960
And then if you slip, that's it.

3844
03:42:49,720 --> 03:42:50,420
Off you go, then.

3845
03:42:50,720 --> 03:42:51,480
I wish you luck.

3846
03:42:52,600 --> 03:42:54,320
Oh, I'm afraid this area is off-limits for you.

3847
03:42:54,600 --> 03:42:56,440
Only the bearer of the sacred kernel.

3848
03:42:56,620 --> 03:42:56,780
Oh!

3849
03:42:57,700 --> 03:42:58,900
As permitted access...

3850
03:42:58,900 --> 03:42:59,720
I have a kernel.

3851
03:43:02,920 --> 03:43:04,300
I have the sacred kernel!

3852
03:43:04,880 --> 03:43:06,540
Oh, like a kernel of corn?

3853
03:43:06,980 --> 03:43:07,580
I have this.

3854
03:43:08,520 --> 03:43:10,800
It was left behind by the plant lady in the glen.

3855
03:43:12,440 --> 03:43:13,900
That is indeed the kernel!

3856
03:43:16,700 --> 03:43:18,420
It is your duty to regrow her.

3857
03:43:18,940 --> 03:43:20,060
Do you understand what you must do?

3858
03:43:21,860 --> 03:43:22,080
No.

3859
03:43:22,660 --> 03:43:23,860
Take the seed to the garden.

3860
03:43:24,320 --> 03:43:25,840
Plant it in the pot in the center.

3861
03:43:26,900 --> 03:43:29,020
You may now pass through here to access the garden.

3862
03:43:30,640 --> 03:43:32,680
Oh my god, we are planting her!

3863
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:40,600
Here.

3864
03:43:41,500 --> 03:43:43,340
It's the similar symbol as before.

3865
03:43:44,960 --> 03:43:46,160
The one that was my wallpaper.

3866
03:43:47,380 --> 03:43:48,960
How is she going to grow in here?

3867
03:43:52,860 --> 03:43:55,500
With this corn, we make the last...

3868
03:43:55,500 --> 03:43:56,760
Oh my gosh, we're going to make a cornfield.

3869
03:43:57,880 --> 03:43:59,180
Time to put the seed in the planter.

3870
03:44:02,200 --> 03:44:03,740
There is no dirt in this pot.

3871
03:44:04,320 --> 03:44:05,580
Will the seed really grow like this?

3872
03:44:10,680 --> 03:44:12,220
Suddenly, like, feel a rumbling.

3873
03:44:14,060 --> 03:44:16,140
And it's my tummy thinking about eating corn.

3874
03:44:18,900 --> 03:44:19,680
I'm kidding.

3875
03:44:19,900 --> 03:44:21,000
It's her growing.

3876
03:44:32,790 --> 03:44:33,890
And work already!

3877
03:44:34,750 --> 03:44:35,010
Huh?

3878
03:44:35,450 --> 03:44:36,110
What was that?

3879
03:44:39,490 --> 03:44:39,730
Oh.

3880
03:44:41,130 --> 03:44:42,870
Why isn't this working?

3881
03:44:43,730 --> 03:44:45,250
I think someone might need help.

3882
03:44:48,950 --> 03:44:49,510
Anomaly.

3883
03:44:54,840 --> 03:44:55,600
Do you have water?

3884
03:44:56,040 --> 03:44:58,360
Oh wait, I did have the test tube of water.

3885
03:44:58,460 --> 03:44:59,240
Let's go back up.

3886
03:44:59,440 --> 03:45:01,060
Oh my gosh, you're so right.

3887
03:45:08,500 --> 03:45:10,020
Wait, do not use the water yet.

3888
03:45:10,140 --> 03:45:12,160
You need another item to upgrade the water for...

3889
03:45:17,930 --> 03:45:19,510
Wait, would it let me use it?

3890
03:45:19,610 --> 03:45:20,450
That'd be kind of messed up.

3891
03:45:24,320 --> 03:45:24,560
Hello.

3892
03:45:25,840 --> 03:45:27,360
Come on, come on.

3893
03:45:27,620 --> 03:45:29,580
I'm too busy for this.

3894
03:45:30,980 --> 03:45:31,840
Excuse me.

3895
03:45:33,260 --> 03:45:34,360
Right on time.

3896
03:45:35,860 --> 03:45:37,200
It does let you!

3897
03:45:37,360 --> 03:45:37,980
Oh wait.

3898
03:45:39,160 --> 03:45:39,520
that.

3899
03:45:41,560 --> 03:45:44,180
Oh my gosh, it soft locks you!

3900
03:45:45,580 --> 03:45:45,940
Oh,

3901
03:45:53,290 --> 03:45:54,410
you're you.

3902
03:45:55,130 --> 03:45:56,810
Oh, geez, I didn't think I was going to run into.

3903
03:45:57,410 --> 03:45:58,310
This is embarrassing.

3904
03:45:59,730 --> 03:46:01,730
Is there anything I can help you with?

3905
03:46:02,270 --> 03:46:02,970
Yes, please.

3906
03:46:03,430 --> 03:46:04,870
I would like to know how to get to the surface.

3907
03:46:05,670 --> 03:46:07,010
Yeah, I was afraid you were going to say that.

3908
03:46:07,550 --> 03:46:11,630
Right now, the elevator is the only way to access the
surface, but...

3909
03:46:12,890 --> 03:46:14,310
Yeah, just take a look at it.

3910
03:46:17,800 --> 03:46:19,260
It looks like an elevator?

3911
03:46:20,200 --> 03:46:23,020
You need to use the normal water first, then refill and
upgrade the new...

3912
03:46:23,020 --> 03:46:23,580
Wait, wait.

3913
03:46:23,740 --> 03:46:25,120
Wait, you can refill it.

3914
03:46:33,700 --> 03:46:35,680
There's an unlimited sink later.

3915
03:46:36,160 --> 03:46:44,440
Oh, well, if I don't need it right now anyway, like if it
doesn't work, then I should just wait until...

3916
03:46:45,180 --> 03:46:46,480
Until I need it, right?

3917
03:46:47,080 --> 03:46:47,780
I think?

3918
03:46:48,420 --> 03:46:49,680
Needs dirt first, too.

3919
03:46:49,840 --> 03:46:51,440
Yeah, I think we'll just...

3920
03:46:53,360 --> 03:46:54,380
Yeah, we'll just wait.

3921
03:46:54,440 --> 03:46:55,240
We don't need to go.

3922
03:46:56,820 --> 03:46:59,660
Well, you're not wrong, but go look at the button panel.

3923
03:47:02,780 --> 03:47:03,680
There aren't any buttons.

3924
03:47:04,740 --> 03:47:05,840
Yep, that's the problem.

3925
03:47:06,600 --> 03:47:08,980
There's usually a big button here that says ground on it.

3926
03:47:09,280 --> 03:47:10,840
You know, because it takes you to the ground area.

3927
03:47:11,420 --> 03:47:13,120
But now it's been ripped out or something.

3928
03:47:13,680 --> 03:47:15,540
I tried looking everywhere for it.

3929
03:47:15,700 --> 03:47:16,400
To no avail.

3930
03:47:18,520 --> 03:47:19,580
Maybe it exploded.

3931
03:47:20,420 --> 03:47:21,700
Do you think we have to make a new one?

3932
03:47:22,140 --> 03:47:22,540
What?

3933
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:23,420
How?

3934
03:47:24,440 --> 03:47:24,900
it out.

3935
03:47:25,660 --> 03:47:26,420
Okay, cool.

3936
03:47:27,840 --> 03:47:29,060
Fix it, Nico.

3937
03:47:32,240 --> 03:47:33,720
What's here?

3938
03:47:34,680 --> 03:47:35,420
Bed.

3939
03:47:36,420 --> 03:47:36,720
Okay.

3940
03:47:40,240 --> 03:47:43,580
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

3941
03:47:53,480 --> 03:47:55,080
I was jamming to that.

3942
03:47:58,680 --> 03:47:59,420
Locked.

3943
03:47:59,760 --> 03:48:01,040
Locked from the inside.

3944
03:48:06,030 --> 03:48:06,570
Locked.

3945
03:48:06,590 --> 03:48:07,010
Lacked.

3946
03:48:09,050 --> 03:48:09,910
Lacked.

3947
03:48:11,250 --> 03:48:12,110
Lacked.

3948
03:48:13,090 --> 03:48:15,230
What is this?

3949
03:48:15,770 --> 03:48:16,570
Oh, robot house.

3950
03:48:17,150 --> 03:48:18,310
A landscape painting.

3951
03:48:20,530 --> 03:48:22,210
Abstract painting.

3952
03:48:23,710 --> 03:48:24,570
She's abstracting?

3953
03:48:25,870 --> 03:48:27,990
Are you an intruder?

3954
03:48:28,610 --> 03:48:38,510
Because if you are, I model 8-XM home security bot TM serial
number 39232 232b839w4 will have to report you.

3955
03:48:39,910 --> 03:48:40,470
Oh, sorry.

3956
03:48:41,090 --> 03:48:43,190
I kind of just walked in because the door was unlocked.

3957
03:48:45,070 --> 03:48:46,030
I have a friend.

3958
03:48:46,130 --> 03:48:49,510
She does that where she tests me.

3959
03:48:49,630 --> 03:48:52,010
She's like, Minto, are you locking your doors?

3960
03:48:52,270 --> 03:48:55,650
So if she comes over, she automatically just tries to walk
inside.

3961
03:48:59,210 --> 03:49:01,050
Was that an amazing digital circus reference?

3962
03:49:01,170 --> 03:49:01,430
Maybe.

3963
03:49:04,470 --> 03:49:13,750
So like, when my And when she comes over, if I know she's
like on her way, I'll just hear her like, like, I'll hear

3964
03:49:13,750 --> 03:49:24,810
the doorknob move and then like a, because it's her like,
like trying to like, like running into the, into the, what's

3965
03:49:24,810 --> 03:49:25,070
it called?

3966
03:49:26,850 --> 03:49:27,330
The door.

3967
03:49:31,530 --> 03:49:33,350
Everyone has that one from that breaks in.

3968
03:49:33,670 --> 03:49:34,370
So true.

3969
03:49:34,890 --> 03:49:35,710
Do you want me to leave?

3970
03:49:36,090 --> 03:49:37,830
Scanning for suspicious activity.

3971
03:49:38,570 --> 03:49:40,110
Suspicious activity is detected.

3972
03:49:41,850 --> 03:49:44,270
Breaking in is not a suspicious activity, everybody.

3973
03:49:44,430 --> 03:49:45,430
You heard it here first.

3974
03:49:45,590 --> 03:49:50,490
One-shot has outlawed breaking into a home.

3975
03:49:51,010 --> 03:49:51,690
You can do that.

3976
03:49:51,750 --> 03:49:52,610
It's not suspicious.

3977
03:49:54,170 --> 03:49:56,030
I guess as long as I don't do anything bad.

3978
03:49:57,770 --> 03:49:58,290
Huge.

3979
03:49:59,190 --> 03:49:59,710
Adminto.

3980
03:50:00,050 --> 03:50:00,790
Someone lives here.

3981
03:50:01,250 --> 03:50:02,270
We can't just sleep in their bed.

3982
03:50:04,230 --> 03:50:04,630
It's off.

3983
03:50:08,070 --> 03:50:08,590
Out.

3984
03:50:09,410 --> 03:50:09,810
Out.

3985
03:50:10,370 --> 03:50:11,450
Outlawed, you're right.

3986
03:50:12,450 --> 03:50:13,050
What is this?

3987
03:50:13,330 --> 03:50:13,550
Dirt?

3988
03:50:14,010 --> 03:50:15,130
A small potted plant.

3989
03:50:15,410 --> 03:50:15,850
Take the dirt.

3990
03:50:15,990 --> 03:50:16,510
Take the dirt.

3991
03:50:18,250 --> 03:50:18,990
A sink.

3992
03:50:20,210 --> 03:50:20,370
Oh, wait.

3993
03:50:27,350 --> 03:50:27,890
Skizzers.

3994
03:50:29,410 --> 03:50:32,070
A pair of scissors on a pile of hair.

3995
03:50:32,630 --> 03:50:35,150
I don't think anyone's using it anymore, so...

3996
03:50:37,150 --> 03:50:38,930
I need scissors 6-1.

3997
03:50:41,370 --> 03:50:43,150
Do I use the scissors on here?

3998
03:50:45,150 --> 03:50:45,610
No.

3999
03:50:47,230 --> 03:50:47,850
Skeezors.

4000
03:50:48,810 --> 03:50:51,040
I can break and enter into here.

4001
03:50:54,090 --> 03:50:55,370
They're my type.

4002
03:50:56,290 --> 03:50:57,610
Wall of family photos.

4003
03:50:58,490 --> 03:50:59,390
Wall of family photos.

4004
03:51:01,170 --> 03:51:04,510
I will unequip the scissors so we do seem less scary.

4005
03:51:12,080 --> 03:51:18,900
Guys, there's a girl in the new Pokemon game that I feel
like I want to play the Pokemon game.

4006
03:51:18,920 --> 03:51:19,760
because of her.

4007
03:51:20,340 --> 03:51:22,820
Her favorite clothing store is called Wisp.

4008
03:51:23,680 --> 03:51:24,500
It's called Wisp.

4009
03:51:30,220 --> 03:51:33,460
And Anonymous Agony needs to join that desktop.

4010
03:51:36,180 --> 03:51:43,720
And she plays with Gengar and and and and she's dressed like
a chandelure.

4011
03:51:45,560 --> 03:51:47,000
She's everything I could ever ask for.

4012
03:51:47,100 --> 03:51:48,100
Do I rip this guy open?

4013
03:51:48,180 --> 03:51:48,900
Is a big penguin?

4014
03:51:48,920 --> 03:51:50,340
Hello penguin.

4015
03:51:59,260 --> 03:52:00,340
Hello, penguin?

4016
03:52:00,820 --> 03:52:01,260
Hello.

4017
03:52:08,330 --> 03:52:09,370
Pink flower.

4018
03:52:09,930 --> 03:52:10,650
It's pink.

4019
03:52:16,440 --> 03:52:18,120
Why did he speak?

4020
03:52:22,310 --> 03:52:23,910
But I don't remember the girl in Pokemon.

4021
03:52:24,070 --> 03:52:24,830
I don't remember her name.

4022
03:52:25,750 --> 03:52:29,250
So you guys could be saying things and I don't know if it's
her or not.

4023
03:52:31,670 --> 03:52:33,190
Oh my gosh, it's Neptune.

4024
03:52:33,510 --> 03:52:34,250
It's Nep-Nep.

4025
03:52:35,570 --> 03:52:37,170
Would you like to play a game?

4026
03:52:37,770 --> 03:52:38,210
Sure.

4027
03:52:38,890 --> 03:52:39,970
What game would you like to play?

4028
03:52:40,710 --> 03:52:41,630
Do you know Rock, Paper, Scissor?

4029
03:52:42,290 --> 03:52:43,470
Desire difficulty level.

4030
03:52:43,750 --> 03:52:44,470
Desire difficulty level.

4031
03:52:44,850 --> 03:52:45,990
She also likes cute girls.

4032
03:52:46,170 --> 03:52:46,990
Yeah, I know.

4033
03:52:47,210 --> 03:52:49,870
She loves the Giaru streamer girl.

4034
03:52:51,990 --> 03:52:53,370
I was like, is she just me?

4035
03:52:57,180 --> 03:52:59,480
Uh, desired duration of turns.

4036
03:53:00,140 --> 03:53:01,620
Uh, please set your timer.

4037
03:53:02,140 --> 03:53:02,640
Never mind.

4038
03:53:04,660 --> 03:53:07,340
My parents are like, literally never home.

4039
03:53:07,800 --> 03:53:08,500
But I don't mind.

4040
03:53:08,620 --> 03:53:09,340
I'm used to it.

4041
03:53:09,580 --> 03:53:14,660
Besides, I've got Model C, W2, 2nd Gen Unit 4E here to keep
me company now.

4042
03:53:15,520 --> 03:53:18,040
She still talks a little weird sometimes, but that's okay.

4043
03:53:18,380 --> 03:53:19,140
She's learning.

4044
03:53:19,800 --> 03:53:22,840
If I work real hard, she might even be Tame someday.

4045
03:53:24,560 --> 03:53:25,740
I keep hearing that word.

4046
03:53:27,060 --> 03:53:27,240
What?

4047
03:53:27,520 --> 03:53:27,880
Tame?

4048
03:53:28,440 --> 03:53:28,780
Mm-hmm.

4049
03:53:29,280 --> 03:53:30,740
Nobody's told me what it means yet.

4050
03:53:31,720 --> 03:53:33,640
That's just like a robot thing.

4051
03:53:34,020 --> 03:53:35,300
I can't really explain it either.

4052
03:53:38,280 --> 03:53:39,560
I'm going to look up the camera.

4053
03:53:39,580 --> 03:53:41,020
character you guys keep saying.

4054
03:53:56,990 --> 03:53:57,550
What was it?

4055
03:53:58,530 --> 03:53:59,310
Uh, Ian?

4056
03:53:59,810 --> 03:54:00,370
Okay, mine.

4057
03:54:02,270 --> 03:54:02,650
Win.

4058
03:54:05,660 --> 03:54:05,940
Win.

4059
03:54:06,640 --> 03:54:06,940
Yeah!

4060
03:54:09,140 --> 03:54:11,800
She's so cute.

4061
03:54:12,860 --> 03:54:14,160
I was like, I think she's me.

4062
03:54:15,940 --> 03:54:17,720
I think she might be me.

4063
03:54:19,320 --> 03:54:21,540
She's so cute.

4064
03:54:24,020 --> 03:54:24,980
Love her.

4065
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:28,580
Love, love, love her.

4066
03:54:29,180 --> 03:54:31,560
And I would love, love, love if, you know, I don't know.

4067
03:54:31,800 --> 03:54:34,920
If anybody ever wanted to make fan art of me and her outfit.

4068
03:54:37,920 --> 03:54:39,760
That would make me so happy.

4069
03:54:42,220 --> 03:54:43,620
Okay, more breaking and entering.

4070
03:54:44,820 --> 03:54:45,600
The bells.

4071
03:54:46,980 --> 03:54:47,400
What is this?

4072
03:54:47,820 --> 03:54:49,420
Something has been chewing on this plant.

4073
03:54:51,420 --> 03:54:52,860
I just moved here from the Glen.

4074
03:54:53,180 --> 03:54:54,380
Things are so different in the city.

4075
03:54:55,660 --> 03:55:04,220
right yeah everything's so green back there i really miss it

room I'm not sure what this is.

4078
03:55:37,470 --> 03:55:38,270
It's like a little car.

4079
03:55:39,110 --> 03:55:40,210
You should ride it.

4080
03:55:41,390 --> 03:55:41,550
What?

4081
03:55:42,270 --> 03:55:43,050

Oh my god, he's so cute.

4086
03:55:56,820 --> 03:55:57,800
It's off.

4087
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:00,820
We're leaving with it?

4088
03:56:01,780 --> 03:56:02,540
Well, that was fun.

4089
03:56:02,860 --> 03:56:03,100
Ah!

4090
03:56:04,040 --> 03:56:05,840
We ride at dawn.

4091
03:56:08,520 --> 03:56:09,160
Fun?

4092
03:56:11,500 --> 03:56:14,300
We have to get... We have to get soil here.

4093
03:56:16,920 --> 03:56:18,040
A small garden trowel.

4094
03:56:18,180 --> 03:56:19,560
The handle part is shaped like an owl?

4095
03:56:20,600 --> 03:56:21,560
I get it!

4096
03:56:24,660 --> 03:56:25,060
Noom.

4097
03:56:26,620 --> 03:56:27,020
Noom.

4098
03:56:30,680 --> 03:56:33,600
I like to stand in the middle of the wheat field back in my
village.

4099
03:56:33,800 --> 03:56:34,800
Oh, it goes on for miles.

4100
03:56:35,360 --> 03:56:36,440
I wish I could have seen it.

4101
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:38,580
In our world, wheat is usually only grown in small...

4102
03:56:38,580 --> 03:56:41,540
I didn't realize, sorry, I stopped reading it out loud.

4103
03:56:42,820 --> 03:56:46,000
Wheat is only grown in small isolated plots or in a flower
pot.

4104
03:56:46,540 --> 03:56:47,360
Wait, who are you?

4105
03:56:47,620 --> 03:56:48,180
Hello there.

4106
03:56:49,020 --> 03:56:50,920
You have a lot of plants.

4107
03:56:51,580 --> 03:56:53,420
Never give an owl a trowel.

4108
03:56:53,700 --> 03:56:54,940
A trowel.

4109
03:56:55,860 --> 03:56:56,560
I do.

4110
03:56:56,700 --> 03:56:58,000
I grew all these myself, you see.

4111
03:56:58,680 --> 03:56:59,940
Feel free to ask me about them.

4112
03:57:00,400 --> 03:57:01,760
Oh, you're a gardener, right?

4113
03:57:02,220 --> 03:57:02,460
Yep.

4114
03:57:02,800 --> 03:57:03,860
Do you happen to have any dirt?

4115
03:57:04,500 --> 03:57:05,520
For growing plants, I mean?

4116
03:57:06,160 --> 03:57:06,420
Yep.

4117
03:57:07,680 --> 03:57:08,520
Do you need some?

4118
03:57:09,060 --> 03:57:09,500
Yes.

4119
03:57:09,800 --> 03:57:12,280
I'm supposed to plant this seed left behind by a plant lady.

4120
03:57:12,820 --> 03:57:14,780
The pot in the garden doesn't have any soil.

4121
03:57:15,840 --> 03:57:16,340
I see.

4122
03:57:17,040 --> 03:57:18,580
I know who you're talking about, yeah.

4123
03:57:19,080 --> 03:57:20,200
Here, take this whole bag.

4124
03:57:21,040 --> 03:57:21,400
Thanks.

4125
03:57:22,800 --> 03:57:23,160
Yippee!

4126
03:57:23,620 --> 03:57:23,880
Okay.

4127
03:57:25,060 --> 03:57:26,860
We got a big old thing of dirt.

4128
03:57:28,720 --> 03:57:29,440
Is this the sink?

4129
03:57:30,760 --> 03:57:31,860
That I couldn't...

4130
03:57:31,860 --> 03:57:32,860
Wow, there's so many...

4131
03:57:32,860 --> 03:57:33,820
A phosphor tree.

4132
03:57:33,960 --> 03:57:35,340
Yeah, like the ones we saw in the glen.

4133
03:57:35,860 --> 03:57:37,200
I always wondered, where are the leaves?

4134
03:57:37,560 --> 03:57:38,520
They're not dead, are they?

4135
03:57:39,780 --> 03:57:41,800
I was thinking, we have a whole bag of dirt.

4136
03:57:42,800 --> 03:57:43,240
strong.

4137
03:57:44,260 --> 03:57:44,600
Not at all.

4138
03:57:44,860 --> 03:57:49,080
Although these trees are composed of a woody tissue, they're
closer to grass, anatomy-wise.

4139
03:57:50,580 --> 03:57:52,360
So the branches are actually leaves?

4140
03:57:53,100 --> 03:57:53,540
Sorta.

4141
03:57:54,060 --> 03:57:57,180
What's interesting about these plants is the amount of
phosphor sap they can generate.

4142
03:57:58,100 --> 03:57:59,360
Phosphor, that's the glowy stuff, right?

4143
03:57:59,880 --> 03:58:00,160
Yep.

4144
03:58:00,780 --> 03:58:03,360
Phosphor can store light energy and slowly emit it over
time.

4145
03:58:03,820 --> 03:58:07,760
Most of the phosphor from this world still contains energy
from before the sun went out.

4146
03:58:08,340 --> 03:58:12,760
Without the sun to recharge them all, well, let's talk about
something else.

4147
03:58:13,660 --> 03:58:22,740
so sad okay well we got our dirt let me see is there
anything else down here no there were quite a few areas

4148
03:58:22,740 --> 03:58:38,940
though like this where whoa what is this coffee machine warm
is this the library they look like phone books we got TV

4149
03:58:38,940 --> 03:58:45,220
head man we got plant pot man Head...

4150
03:58:45,220 --> 03:58:46,540
Head... uh...

4151
03:58:46,540 --> 03:58:47,680
Whoa, shiny!

4152
03:58:49,780 --> 03:58:51,360
The fridge has magnets on it.

4153
03:58:51,740 --> 03:58:52,580
Maybe they'll come in handy?

4154
03:58:53,140 --> 03:58:54,600
I hope nobody will mind me taking them.

4155
03:58:55,080 --> 03:58:55,180
Oh!

4156
03:58:57,100 --> 03:58:57,580
Okay.

4157
03:58:59,360 --> 03:59:00,080
A fridge.

4158
03:59:00,960 --> 03:59:01,920
Just a trash can.

4159
03:59:04,400 --> 03:59:05,900
He sat too close to the TV.

4160
03:59:06,140 --> 03:59:07,720
That's what your parents always warn you about.

4161
03:59:08,480 --> 03:59:09,580
Don't sit too close.

4162
03:59:12,840 --> 03:59:14,920
Hmm, we'll come back.

4163
03:59:17,400 --> 03:59:20,140
We can go do the dirt and...

4164
03:59:20,140 --> 03:59:23,800
Maybe the water, even though I have to upgrade the water or
something.

4165
03:59:25,320 --> 03:59:27,760
Oh, this is the bathroom, that's right.

4166
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:30,000
And where we got...

4167
03:59:30,000 --> 03:59:31,340
The scissors.

4168
03:59:32,740 --> 03:59:35,360
I think we've been in everything around here now.

4169
03:59:38,240 --> 03:59:39,680
This was locked, right?

4170
03:59:40,800 --> 03:59:41,320
Yes.

4171
03:59:42,820 --> 03:59:43,440
Okay.

4172
03:59:44,280 --> 03:59:45,680
So this leads outside.

4173
03:59:51,710 --> 03:59:53,770
Yes, yes, yes.

4174
03:59:55,170 --> 03:59:56,450
And this is the elevator.

4175
03:59:57,330 --> 03:59:58,210
Yes, yes.

4176
03:59:58,590 --> 03:59:59,810
Wait, did I go down here?

4177
04:00:02,150 --> 04:00:03,190
Oh, the bed.

4178
04:00:06,030 --> 04:00:07,990
Yes, yes, yes.

4179
04:00:10,510 --> 04:00:12,710
And this is abstract.

4180
04:00:13,070 --> 04:00:13,910
Those squares again.

4181
04:00:14,350 --> 04:00:14,650
Okay.

4182
04:00:23,620 --> 04:00:26,480
Well, I'm just exploring now, but it's kind of crazy.

4183
04:00:27,400 --> 04:00:28,080
Wait, is this another...

4184
04:00:28,080 --> 04:00:28,300
Okay.

4185
04:00:29,260 --> 04:00:31,280
I thought this was going to be like another apartment area.

4186
04:00:33,980 --> 04:00:34,500
What's this?

4187
04:00:34,940 --> 04:00:35,560
Empty toffee.

4188
04:00:35,880 --> 04:00:38,920
Toffee, toffee, coffee, coffee tin.

4189
04:00:42,640 --> 04:00:42,920
Hello.

4190
04:00:43,520 --> 04:00:44,860
How come there aren't any people here?

4191
04:00:45,440 --> 04:00:47,080
Normally, cafes have tons of people.

4192
04:00:49,400 --> 04:00:50,740
Yeah, it's a really slow day.

4193
04:00:51,340 --> 04:00:53,480
You think it's because the ground access elevator is broken?

4194
04:00:54,080 --> 04:00:55,120
So I've been told.

4195
04:00:55,560 --> 04:00:58,240
The city's infrastructure has been suffering a lot lately.

4196
04:00:59,280 --> 04:00:59,640
Lady.

4197
04:01:03,300 --> 04:01:05,960
I can't speak anymore!

4198
04:01:08,260 --> 04:01:14,060
Well, I almost said sidewalks instead of skywalks though.

4199
04:01:16,220 --> 04:01:17,660
Mint skywalker.

4200
04:01:19,300 --> 04:01:21,700
Skywalks and stairs breaking off left and right.

4201
04:01:22,060 --> 04:01:24,540
Now the only reliable way of transport are those elevators.

4202
04:01:25,640 --> 04:01:26,160
anyway.

4203
04:01:28,420 --> 04:01:29,380
I'm gonna take a sippy.

4204
04:01:33,900 --> 04:01:35,120
And I'm gonna have a mint.

4205
04:01:39,200 --> 04:01:39,660
Nice.

4206
04:01:40,320 --> 04:01:40,540
Okay.

4207
04:01:42,960 --> 04:01:44,520
We're good guys, we're good.

4208
04:01:46,660 --> 04:01:47,500
We're all okay.

4209
04:01:52,750 --> 04:01:55,650
There's only, there's not many places we can go around here
though.

4210
04:02:01,570 --> 04:02:03,230
Don't forget to stretch!

4211
04:02:04,970 --> 04:02:05,410
Yes.

4212
04:02:11,890 --> 04:02:13,470
Oh, we got a clock, girl.

4213
04:02:14,450 --> 04:02:14,850
Good evening.

4214
04:02:15,750 --> 04:02:17,730
Well, the time of day doesn't really mean anything now.

4215
04:02:18,590 --> 04:02:20,570
With the sun gone, the night never seems to end.

4216
04:02:21,630 --> 04:02:22,470
Then how can you tell?

4217
04:02:23,530 --> 04:02:24,350
Time I mean.

4218
04:02:25,110 --> 04:02:26,010
I have my ways.

4219
04:02:27,530 --> 04:02:28,630
She's a literal clock.

4220
04:02:34,700 --> 04:02:35,040
Evil.

4221
04:02:37,860 --> 04:02:39,260
You're going to need this soon.

4222
04:02:39,920 --> 04:02:48,200
take this film and expose it to the void the answer will be
revealed when you bring it back again a computer printed out

4223
04:02:48,200 --> 04:02:58,880
a strange print transparent sheet bring it to the void a
transparent sheet filled with numbers what do the numbers

4224
04:02:58,880 --> 04:03:03,620
mean the void huh

4225
04:03:09,520 --> 04:03:16,760
heavy piece of metal set into the wall I think it might be a
door of some kind There's a small screen here in the middle.

4226
04:03:16,780 --> 04:03:17,200
Okay.

4227
04:03:19,900 --> 04:03:22,160
I'm exploring this mysterious area.

4228
04:03:26,320 --> 04:03:27,280
Infamous puzzle.

4229
04:03:27,480 --> 04:03:28,140
What does that mean?

4230
04:03:29,160 --> 04:03:32,700
If you hold a clock girl's hands, it's like time has
stopped.

4231
04:03:34,220 --> 04:03:35,040
What's happening?

4232
04:03:38,210 --> 04:03:40,490
I've actually never been to a big city before.

4233
04:03:41,330 --> 04:03:42,730
All these lights, all these people.

4234
04:03:43,550 --> 04:03:45,590
I guess most of this world's population lives here.

4235
04:03:47,590 --> 04:03:47,990
Oh!

4236
04:03:51,960 --> 04:03:53,540
Time has stopped.

4237
04:04:05,060 --> 04:04:08,380
This puzzle is absolutely next level, very good stuff.

4238
04:04:08,840 --> 04:04:09,120
Hmm.

4239
04:04:10,660 --> 04:04:12,060
It's very different from my village.

4240
04:04:12,780 --> 04:04:15,560
The village is very small and surrounded by huge fields.

4241
04:04:16,180 --> 04:04:18,560
You saw a bit of that in one of my dreams from a while ago.

4242
04:04:19,360 --> 04:04:28,270
The tallest buildings in our village are only two stories to
How far am I running?

4243
04:04:33,560 --> 04:04:34,340
What about you, Enminto?

4244
04:04:35,240 --> 04:04:35,600
Where do you?

4245
04:04:38,360 --> 04:04:38,840
Um...

4246
04:04:38,840 --> 04:04:40,860
This isn't gonna, like, say anything bad, is it?

4247
04:04:49,860 --> 04:04:52,600
Well, Nico, I so happen to live at...

4248
04:04:54,160 --> 04:04:55,120
Virtual Hackyama!

4249
04:04:58,660 --> 04:05:01,020
The game does not docks where you live.

4250
04:05:08,240 --> 04:05:09,120
A city.

4251
04:05:10,640 --> 04:05:11,800
A city like this?

4252
04:05:12,360 --> 04:05:12,680
Wow.

4253
04:05:13,420 --> 04:05:14,800
I can't imagine living in a city.

4254
04:05:16,040 --> 04:05:17,160
What's your IP address?

4255
04:05:17,460 --> 04:05:17,940
Admin, though.

4256
04:05:19,740 --> 04:05:21,140
Must be exciting.

4257
04:05:21,820 --> 04:05:22,580
Kind of scary.

4258
04:05:23,420 --> 04:05:24,340
The view is nice, though.

4259
04:05:30,280 --> 04:05:31,420
Oh, did I just go in a circle?

4260
04:05:31,700 --> 04:05:32,100
I think so.

4261
04:05:41,650 --> 04:05:55,040
Just a little place where we get to learn more about nico
cute we've got her gang she lives in a city oh no and don't

4262
04:05:55,040 --> 04:06:03,600
go to maid cafes that would be the worst don't go to maid
cafes looking for me don't go to maid cafes and and support

4263
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:11,020
the maid cafes of akihabara and you know moi moikun and
everything while searching for me in akihabara

4264
04:06:18,580 --> 04:06:19,680
Let's get going!

4265
04:06:19,860 --> 04:06:21,740
I'm headed to the city right now!

4266
04:06:23,860 --> 04:06:24,600
A tape dispenser.

4267
04:06:25,880 --> 04:06:26,920
It's bolted to the table.

4268
04:06:33,780 --> 04:06:36,720
If I cut off a piece of tape, it would just lose its
stickiness.

4269
04:06:36,980 --> 04:06:37,880
Oh, I guess that's fair.

4270
04:06:40,760 --> 04:06:42,660
I don't even know what I need the tape for.

4271
04:06:43,940 --> 04:06:45,700
They are just bolted so people won't seal them.

4272
04:06:45,820 --> 04:06:46,640
Feel free to use, though.

4273
04:06:48,200 --> 04:06:50,140
Why was it in such ominous red...

4274
04:06:51,360 --> 04:06:53,340
Some kind of computer terminal.

4275
04:06:56,420 --> 04:06:58,120
I am the power room mechanic.

4276
04:06:58,920 --> 04:07:00,160
Do you have an issue to report?

4277
04:07:00,780 --> 04:07:01,380
Yeah, actually.

4278
04:07:01,700 --> 04:07:03,780
The surface access elevator appears to be broken.

4279
04:07:04,880 --> 04:07:08,560
Oh, maybe we use the tape for the button.

4280
04:07:09,620 --> 04:07:10,480
Can you go take a look?

4281
04:07:11,420 --> 04:07:13,180
Leaving this room is not in my programming.

4282
04:07:13,840 --> 04:07:14,680
Ah, never mind.

4283
04:07:16,600 --> 04:07:17,120
Hmm.

4284
04:07:19,940 --> 04:07:21,460
Maybe, do I use the magnets?

4285
04:07:21,580 --> 04:07:22,460
That's what I was thinking.

4286
04:07:32,400 --> 04:07:34,200
I forgot that was our ultimate goal.

4287
04:07:39,080 --> 04:07:40,500
The magnets don't stick to aluminum.

4288
04:07:42,920 --> 04:07:43,580
Hold on now.

4289
04:07:43,640 --> 04:07:47,420
I'm gonna go back to the computer for a hint on this puzzle.

4290
04:07:49,120 --> 04:07:49,560
Hint!

4291
04:07:49,880 --> 04:07:50,200
Hint!

4292
04:07:54,280 --> 04:07:55,320
Still clueless?

4293
04:07:55,980 --> 04:07:56,500
Figures.

4294
04:07:57,200 --> 04:07:59,080
One another tip, yes.

4295
04:07:59,620 --> 04:08:02,760
There's a void beyond the four walls that bind our world to
yours.

4296
04:08:03,580 --> 04:08:06,960
The edges of your viewport, where everything is obscured.

4297
04:08:08,360 --> 04:08:09,020
So the window?

4298
04:08:11,240 --> 04:08:12,760
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

4299
04:08:13,340 --> 04:08:15,380
Pass the film through the void and back again.

4300
04:08:24,520 --> 04:08:25,000
Uh...

4301
04:08:26,940 --> 04:08:27,420
Wait,

4302
04:08:31,280 --> 04:08:31,760
oh...

4303
04:08:32,800 --> 04:08:33,280
Uh...

4304
04:08:33,280 --> 04:08:34,140
Wait...

4305
04:08:37,080 --> 04:08:38,900
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

4306
04:08:39,000 --> 04:08:40,220
I might have to plug in a mouse.

4307
04:08:45,240 --> 04:08:46,920
Yeah, because I can't drag the window.

4308
04:08:48,500 --> 04:08:49,880
So give me one second.

4309
04:08:50,060 --> 04:08:51,840
I'm gonna go get another mouse.

4310
04:09:15,340 --> 04:09:15,780
Okie dokie.

4311
04:09:18,120 --> 04:09:20,260
Let me plug it in.

4312
04:09:22,620 --> 04:09:23,980
Let me plug it in.

4313
04:09:28,100 --> 04:09:29,780
Let me turn it on.

4314
04:09:32,460 --> 04:09:33,660
Okie dokie.

4315
04:09:35,180 --> 04:09:36,620
And okay, cool.

4316
04:09:36,980 --> 04:09:37,960
So if I...

4317
04:09:40,900 --> 04:09:41,600
Whoa!

4318
04:09:51,020 --> 04:09:51,940
63014.

4319
04:09:53,320 --> 04:09:53,640
What?

4320
04:10:03,890 --> 04:10:07,980
Well, at least I have a mouse now.

4321
04:10:08,680 --> 04:10:09,520
Proper mouse.

4322
04:10:14,000 --> 04:10:25,840
was there a thing that needed the digits though or oh
there's notes even oh that's this thank you thank you

4323
04:10:30,570 --> 04:10:43,310
that was crazy that was cool oh my gosh I'm so glad I'm
playing this game not desktop right or not game capture

4324
04:10:48,550 --> 04:10:49,350
Write that down!

4325
04:10:49,470 --> 04:10:50,550
Write that down!

4326
04:10:52,570 --> 04:10:52,970
63014.

4327
04:10:53,170 --> 04:10:54,370
Let's put the dirt down.

4328
04:10:56,750 --> 04:10:58,230
Oh, you're a little corn kernel.

4329
04:10:58,370 --> 04:10:59,390
You want to get all dirty?

4330
04:11:00,490 --> 04:11:00,890
Yeah.

4331
04:11:01,550 --> 04:11:01,950
Ew.

4332
04:11:03,390 --> 04:11:04,110
Where is it?

4333
04:11:04,490 --> 04:11:04,910
Oh, dirt.

4334
04:11:07,070 --> 04:11:08,890
I hope this helps you grow, little seed.

4335
04:11:10,790 --> 04:11:13,050
The seed's in the soil, but it looks a bit dry.

4336
04:11:18,040 --> 04:11:19,480
I'm gonna try, see what happens.

4337
04:11:19,820 --> 04:11:20,900
Good thinking, Adminto.

4338
04:11:21,840 --> 04:11:22,900
the seed grow.

4339
04:11:25,100 --> 04:11:27,720
The dirt's nice and moist now, but what if it dries out?

4340
04:11:27,780 --> 04:11:29,660
There's only so much water from this little tube.

4341
04:11:30,220 --> 04:11:32,040
I'll hold on to the tube for now, just in case.

4342
04:11:36,040 --> 04:11:36,760
She's dry.

4343
04:11:36,940 --> 04:11:37,700
She's dry.

4344
04:11:39,000 --> 04:11:42,260
She says, please, Admito, I'm so thirsty.

4345
04:11:42,780 --> 04:11:43,700
I'm so thirsty.

4346
04:11:43,960 --> 04:11:46,620
I'm just a little plant, and I'm so thirsty.

4347
04:11:54,930 --> 04:11:59,430
If it's been ripped out, how come there's an There aren't
any broken wires inside the empty slot.

4348
04:11:59,930 --> 04:12:01,010
Playing mist helped.

4349
04:12:01,410 --> 04:12:02,190
Cool puzzle, though.

4350
04:12:03,930 --> 04:12:05,230
Honey, thank you for the simp or die!

4351
04:12:07,890 --> 04:12:10,110
Well, I'm no engineer, but...

4352
04:12:10,110 --> 04:12:12,610
It's powered by some kind of magnetic technology.

4353
04:12:17,000 --> 04:12:21,080
A man said something about magnets, but I don't see any way
to fit these into the panel by themselves.

4354
04:12:21,540 --> 04:12:23,600
Me immediately grabbing them.

4355
04:12:30,950 --> 04:12:33,430
I think you'll be able to make that button?

4356
04:12:33,910 --> 04:12:34,770
Well, no pressure, kid.

4357
04:12:35,230 --> 04:12:37,250
I'll just stick with my original plan for now.

4358
04:12:37,770 --> 04:12:39,310
Time to kick the door again.

4359
04:12:40,930 --> 04:12:41,290
Kick!

4360
04:12:42,250 --> 04:12:43,330
My foot hurts.

4361
04:12:48,810 --> 04:12:50,990
I can't remember where I need to go.

4362
04:12:52,910 --> 04:12:54,070
Okay, this is bed.

4363
04:12:54,810 --> 04:12:57,550
Probably before we go down the elevator, we gotta go to bed.

4364
04:12:59,330 --> 04:13:00,430
I keep going to the bed.

4365
04:13:01,690 --> 04:13:02,790
Just call me.

4366
04:13:03,730 --> 04:13:04,910
What was her name?

4367
04:13:07,090 --> 04:13:08,410
Call me.

4368
04:13:09,030 --> 04:13:09,890
What was her name?

4369
04:13:17,280 --> 04:13:18,880
Rio, yeah.

4370
04:13:20,660 --> 04:13:22,100
Thanks for the years to be with us.

4371
04:13:22,600 --> 04:13:23,000
Damn!

4372
04:13:23,960 --> 04:13:24,880
Thank you!

4373
04:13:25,660 --> 04:13:26,840
Thank you so much.

4374
04:13:29,180 --> 04:13:30,860
The bed?

4375
04:13:31,500 --> 04:13:31,800
Right.

4376
04:13:32,840 --> 04:13:33,260
The bed?

4377
04:13:35,300 --> 04:13:35,420
The bed?

4378
04:13:35,420 --> 04:13:35,680
The bed?

4379
04:13:35,700 --> 04:13:35,700
The bed?

4380
04:13:40,680 --> 04:13:40,960
The bed?

4381
04:13:50,880 --> 04:13:52,720
In her mouth.

4382
04:13:59,640 --> 04:14:00,520
Gustav's room.

4383
04:14:00,920 --> 04:14:01,920
Oh, my God.

4384
04:14:03,700 --> 04:14:04,140
Oh.

4385
04:14:10,260 --> 04:14:10,780
All right.

4386
04:14:10,880 --> 04:14:12,860
I'm going to go through all of these places again.

4387
04:14:15,860 --> 04:14:17,440
See if I missed anything.

4388
04:14:18,860 --> 04:14:20,420
Maybe she'll talk to me now.

4389
04:14:24,580 --> 04:14:24,960
Okay.

4390
04:14:30,380 --> 04:14:32,160
Oh, we don't even talk to it anymore.

4391
04:14:33,000 --> 04:14:33,880
Oh, my God.

4392
04:14:34,480 --> 04:14:35,540
Wait, do I have anything that I...

4393
04:14:35,560 --> 04:14:37,500
I could like...

4394
04:14:39,640 --> 04:14:41,340
It's so scary.

4395
04:14:44,260 --> 04:14:46,040
It's so freaky.

4396
04:14:46,440 --> 04:14:47,660
It's way too freaky.

4397
04:14:48,860 --> 04:14:49,220
Hello.

4398
04:14:52,780 --> 04:14:53,220
Oh.

4399
04:14:55,060 --> 04:14:55,500
Where?

4400
04:15:00,340 --> 04:15:01,160
Ride the Roomba.

4401
04:15:03,400 --> 04:15:03,960
The Zumba.

4402
04:15:06,840 --> 04:15:07,860
Oh wait, there was this area.

4403
04:15:07,960 --> 04:15:08,940
I forgot to talk to this guy.

4404
04:15:09,020 --> 04:15:09,520
That's so true.

4405
04:15:10,900 --> 04:15:11,440
Hello.

4406
04:15:12,260 --> 04:15:13,060
Hey there.

4407
04:15:14,300 --> 04:15:15,120
You the Messiah?

4408
04:15:15,680 --> 04:15:16,000
Mm-hmm.

4409
04:15:17,140 --> 04:15:17,880
I like your scarf.

4410
04:15:18,600 --> 04:15:19,300
Thank you.

4411
04:15:19,880 --> 04:15:20,980
Mama made it for me.

4412
04:15:21,660 --> 04:15:22,820
Tell her I like her needlework.

4413
04:15:23,380 --> 04:15:23,760
I will.

4414
04:15:24,480 --> 04:15:25,380
When I see her again.

4415
04:15:26,340 --> 04:15:27,120
That's all it was.

4416
04:15:29,140 --> 04:15:31,100
Looks like I can unlatch this door.

4417
04:15:32,740 --> 04:15:33,920
Just a trash can.

4418
04:15:36,340 --> 04:15:37,540
Did I go through here?

4419
04:15:42,870 --> 04:15:43,410
Ah!

4420
04:15:43,510 --> 04:15:44,710
Wow, it's a shortcut!

4421
04:15:45,190 --> 04:15:46,510
Oh, I see, I see.

4422
04:15:47,430 --> 04:15:48,410
Oh, okay, okay.

4423
04:15:49,170 --> 04:15:49,170
Nice.

4424
04:15:50,070 --> 04:15:51,910
Okay, that's handy, I suppose.

4425
04:15:59,040 --> 04:15:59,760
Thank you for the stream.

4426
04:16:00,120 --> 04:16:00,580
Adminto.

4427
04:16:00,720 --> 04:16:01,200
X-ray!

4428
04:16:01,760 --> 04:16:03,040
Thank you for the super chat.

4429
04:16:03,400 --> 04:16:04,480
I really appreciate it.

4430
04:16:05,060 --> 04:16:06,100
Thank you!

4431
04:16:07,980 --> 04:16:08,960
Oh, wow.

4432
04:16:10,020 --> 04:16:12,320
Most of the plants in our world tend to grow in the glen.

4433
04:16:12,840 --> 04:16:17,140
Even if it's facing the flooding issues, it's still a better
condition than the other two areas.

4434
04:16:18,140 --> 04:16:19,300
as well, the barons.

4435
04:16:19,820 --> 04:16:23,760
And Refuge City is barely enough ground to stand on, let
alone grow stuff.

4436
04:16:24,320 --> 04:16:25,840
On a larger scale than this, I mean.

4437
04:16:32,320 --> 04:16:33,500
Good luck with that scene now.

4438
04:16:34,440 --> 04:16:35,660
Can I fill it here?

4439
04:16:36,680 --> 04:16:38,660
I can refill this tube with more water here.

4440
04:16:39,460 --> 04:16:39,720
Okay.

4441
04:16:40,900 --> 04:16:43,880
Is there a way to make it better?

4442
04:16:45,580 --> 04:16:47,440
Oh, no, nope, nope.

4443
04:16:48,960 --> 04:16:49,760
Tube of water.

4444
04:16:51,560 --> 04:16:52,000
Hmm.

4445
04:16:53,440 --> 04:16:55,060
Filled with plant clippings.

4446
04:16:57,080 --> 04:16:57,800
Black clover.

4447
04:16:57,980 --> 04:16:59,880
Probably the only plant hardly...

4448
04:16:59,880 --> 04:17:02,200
Hardy enough to survive naturally outside the gland.

4449
04:17:02,700 --> 04:17:04,600
Firstly, I think they're really boring to look at.

4450
04:17:05,080 --> 04:17:06,720
One of my customers really loves them, though.

4451
04:17:07,140 --> 04:17:09,240
I think of all the black clovers I'm growing here.

4452
04:17:10,160 --> 04:17:10,500
Wait, wait.

4453
04:17:10,500 --> 04:17:13,420
I think all of the black clovers I'm growing here are for
him, actually.

4454
04:17:13,860 --> 04:17:14,500
Come to think of it.

4455
04:17:14,580 --> 04:17:15,540
I haven't seen him in a while.

4456
04:17:17,520 --> 04:17:19,140
I wonder when he's coming to pick these up.

4457
04:17:19,760 --> 04:17:20,580
Do you think it's...

4458
04:17:22,580 --> 04:17:26,580
elevator okay cool thank you i wonder what was his name kim

4459
04:17:45,180 --> 04:17:48,840
guys i don't know is it okay let's see what we can combine

4460
04:17:52,120 --> 04:18:01,300
maybe you can make a button cut out a piece of the can and
fold it into rectangle ship shape make arts of crafts whoa i

4461
04:18:01,300 --> 04:18:08,260
don't think it's supposed to be this simple how are we going
to connect it to the elevator maybe okay what we can do is

4462
04:18:08,260 --> 04:18:21,780
then tape it to the button it says ground because it was
ground coffee and then um wait where was the tape oh and

4463
04:18:25,260 --> 04:18:36,560
then we magnet it we have to tape the magnet to the back
because magnet does not stick to aluminum i think it was

4464
04:18:36,560 --> 04:18:37,300
over this way

4465
04:18:43,390 --> 04:18:47,230
yes Down here?

4466
04:18:50,170 --> 04:18:50,950
Or no, no, no.

4467
04:18:53,490 --> 04:18:55,310
Okay, we got this guys, we got this.

4468
04:18:56,450 --> 04:18:58,970
Yes, okay, so now we button.

4469
04:19:01,810 --> 04:19:03,550
What if we just folded the magnets under this edge?

4470
04:19:03,630 --> 04:19:03,950
Oh, wait.

4471
04:19:04,630 --> 04:19:06,010
It's holding together, but just barely.

4472
04:19:06,170 --> 04:19:06,830
I hope that's good enough.

4473
04:19:08,050 --> 04:19:08,690
Magnetize button.

4474
04:19:08,910 --> 04:19:11,630
Wait, okay, then if we do this and maybe tape it together.

4475
04:19:12,210 --> 04:19:12,870
A tape dispenser.

4476
04:19:13,210 --> 04:19:14,630
I gotta tape it together, it might fall apart.

4477
04:19:14,730 --> 04:19:15,030
There we go.

4478
04:19:15,690 --> 04:19:16,250
Yeah!

4479
04:19:16,650 --> 04:19:17,250
Oh my god!

4480
04:19:19,210 --> 04:19:19,770
I cooked!

4481
04:19:19,970 --> 04:19:20,430
I cooked!

4482
04:19:21,110 --> 04:19:21,430
Go!

4483
04:19:24,490 --> 04:19:24,910
Go!

4484
04:19:25,530 --> 04:19:25,670
Go!

4485
04:19:26,090 --> 04:19:26,090
Go!

4486
04:19:36,000 --> 04:19:37,320
Let's hope this works!

4487
04:19:40,120 --> 04:19:40,800
Oh!

4488
04:19:41,960 --> 04:19:42,960
Oh no!

4489
04:19:43,720 --> 04:19:43,720
Oh!

4490
04:19:47,260 --> 04:19:47,940
Oh.

4491
04:19:47,940 --> 04:19:49,660
Reactivating elevator services.

4492
04:19:50,080 --> 04:19:51,740
Please input security code to continue.

4493
04:19:52,360 --> 04:19:52,620
What?

4494
04:19:52,920 --> 04:19:53,860
That's never happened before?

4495
04:19:54,780 --> 04:19:55,600
The squares?

4496
04:19:56,260 --> 04:19:56,500
Huh?

4497
04:19:56,700 --> 04:19:57,520
You saw them, right?

4498
04:19:57,860 --> 04:19:59,620
We're on the door and...

4499
04:19:59,620 --> 04:20:01,960
Nah, the square stuff happens all the time.

4500
04:20:02,440 --> 04:20:03,800
I meant the whole security code thing.

4501
04:20:04,440 --> 04:20:06,320
Then again, the elevator hasn't been this broken before.

4502
04:20:06,680 --> 04:20:07,580
I know the code!

4503
04:20:09,960 --> 04:20:10,360
80085!

4504
04:20:11,360 --> 04:20:13,020
Guess we should go look for a code ad, Minto!

4505
04:20:14,740 --> 04:20:15,700
I know it!

4506
04:20:17,300 --> 04:20:18,540
Oh, what was it?

4507
04:20:19,780 --> 04:20:21,160
Wait, hold on.

4508
04:20:25,360 --> 04:20:25,760
63014.

4509
04:20:28,180 --> 04:20:30,700
Should I be worried my cat is swatting at you?

4510
04:20:33,080 --> 04:20:33,600
Six?

4511
04:20:35,680 --> 04:20:35,980
Three?

4512
04:20:36,640 --> 04:20:39,280
Oh, one, four.

4513
04:20:42,280 --> 04:20:42,800
Yippee!

4514
04:20:44,760 --> 04:20:45,280
What?

4515
04:20:45,700 --> 04:20:46,260
It works!

4516
04:20:46,820 --> 04:20:48,360
I don't know what you did, but it actually works!

4517
04:20:49,640 --> 04:20:50,260
Good job, kid.

4518
04:20:50,940 --> 04:20:51,460
You're a genius.

4519
04:20:52,480 --> 04:20:54,020
My head is getting bigger.

4520
04:20:54,800 --> 04:20:56,100
Fat, fat head.

4521
04:20:57,900 --> 04:20:59,340
You're a genius, you know that?

4522
04:21:00,040 --> 04:21:01,800
Well, I had help from Admito too.

4523
04:21:02,480 --> 04:21:02,800
Alright.

4524
04:21:03,460 --> 04:21:04,720
A whole messiah business.

4525
04:21:06,780 --> 04:21:07,540
Anyway, ready to go?

4526
04:21:07,900 --> 04:21:08,540
I'll be up ahead.

4527
04:21:11,420 --> 04:21:13,740
Yon, I'm having trouble staying awake, Admito.

4528
04:21:14,160 --> 04:21:15,580
We should find a place for me to take a nap.

4529
04:21:20,490 --> 04:21:21,250
Sleep time.

4530
04:21:22,150 --> 04:21:23,030
Wrinkly brain.

4531
04:21:23,390 --> 04:21:24,330
Yes, yes.

4532
04:21:24,670 --> 04:21:25,490
What are these?

4533
04:21:26,550 --> 04:21:28,230
I thought they were gravestones.

4534
04:21:29,450 --> 04:21:30,190
Just like home.

4535
04:21:30,370 --> 04:21:40,990
for me i'm a little tired from walking it's all right if i
take a nap yes okay shut the game all right let me uh open

4536
04:21:40,990 --> 04:21:41,880
up the game once again

4537
04:22:05,280 --> 04:22:09,600
pancakes oh my gosh looks delicious

4538
04:22:15,400 --> 04:22:18,680
We're gonna get you home so you can eat pancakes from your
mama!

4539
04:22:21,280 --> 04:22:23,320
Admin, though, I had another dream.

4540
04:22:23,980 --> 04:22:24,620
Mama was there.

4541
04:22:25,060 --> 04:22:25,640
Did you see her?

4542
04:22:26,260 --> 04:22:26,740
Yes.

4543
04:22:28,520 --> 04:22:30,000
She made me pancakes!

4544
04:22:30,880 --> 04:22:32,240
I think it was my birthday.

4545
04:22:33,020 --> 04:22:35,080
Because people always get their favorite food on their
birthday.

4546
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:37,080
A whole lot of it.

4547
04:22:37,840 --> 04:22:38,740
You have a birthday too?

4548
04:22:39,600 --> 04:22:39,980
Wow.

4549
04:22:41,460 --> 04:22:41,940
Yes?

4550
04:22:42,640 --> 04:22:43,040
Oh!

4551
04:22:43,440 --> 04:22:44,900
And what's your favorite food?

4552
04:22:45,400 --> 04:22:46,060
The pancakes?

4553
04:22:46,520 --> 04:22:48,120
Wait, do you like pancakes?

4554
04:22:49,360 --> 04:22:49,840
Okay.

4555
04:22:52,700 --> 04:22:53,180
Confession.

4556
04:22:54,380 --> 04:22:57,580
I don't really like pancakes, but I don't want to make Nico
sad.

4557
04:23:04,460 --> 04:23:05,580
What do- do I lie?

4558
04:23:06,040 --> 04:23:07,440
It's just a small lie.

4559
04:23:08,220 --> 04:23:09,180
I like waffles.

4560
04:23:12,920 --> 04:23:14,580
So you're going to lie?

4561
04:23:14,780 --> 04:23:15,580
I mean!

4562
04:23:16,520 --> 04:23:18,840
I don't know, I don't want to make him sad!

4563
04:23:24,880 --> 04:23:26,080
Okay, I'll be honest.

4564
04:23:28,140 --> 04:23:29,760
Be honest, he'll be fine.

4565
04:23:31,480 --> 04:23:33,120
I'm honest, I'm an honest mid.

4566
04:23:34,060 --> 04:23:34,740
Ghost mid.

4567
04:23:38,340 --> 04:23:39,500
You can like both.

4568
04:23:39,560 --> 04:23:42,780
No, I just actually don't like pancakes very much.

4569
04:23:42,860 --> 04:23:44,160
They're like too doughy for me.

4570
04:23:45,860 --> 04:23:46,840
I don't know what it is.

4571
04:23:48,220 --> 04:23:49,340
I just like waffles.

4572
04:23:52,760 --> 04:23:53,760
I'm honest.

4573
04:23:57,020 --> 04:23:59,020
Maybe you should give them a chance, you know.

4574
04:24:03,280 --> 04:24:04,820
Fine, Nico, for you.

4575
04:24:05,140 --> 04:24:05,880
I'll give waffles.

4576
04:24:06,160 --> 04:24:08,520
I mean, wait, I'll give pancakes a chance.

4577
04:24:08,680 --> 04:24:10,480
Yeah, I have waffles on the brain.

4578
04:24:14,060 --> 04:24:16,300
My mama makes the best pancakes.

4579
04:24:17,080 --> 04:24:20,440
And some of the neighbors really make really good noodles.

4580
04:24:21,220 --> 04:24:22,360
Wait, you're actually the meme.

4581
04:24:22,780 --> 04:24:23,600
No, I'm not.

4582
04:24:24,640 --> 04:24:25,880
I'm not the meme.

4583
04:24:26,400 --> 04:24:26,840
Oh, wait.

4584
04:24:27,460 --> 04:24:28,840
Because you like waffles, you like...

4585
04:24:28,860 --> 04:24:30,040
don't like pancakes?

4586
04:24:30,420 --> 04:24:31,380
Oh yeah, I'm the meme.

4587
04:24:39,230 --> 04:24:41,210
American pancakes are also too thick for me.

4588
04:24:41,410 --> 04:24:41,930
Try other styles.

4589
04:24:42,210 --> 04:24:49,230
I've tried like the fluffy ones that like kind of jiggle
wiggle, but they are also too... I just don't like those

4590
04:24:49,230 --> 04:24:49,610
either.

4591
04:24:50,290 --> 04:24:51,690
I think because they're made with egg.

4592
04:24:52,310 --> 04:24:52,610
Maybe.

4593
04:24:52,930 --> 04:24:53,590
I don't know.

4594
04:24:54,270 --> 04:24:55,630
Stop painting on me!

4595
04:25:05,940 --> 04:25:07,420
Try the flatter ones.

4596
04:25:07,580 --> 04:25:10,060
Maybe... Wait, but those are not pancakes anymore, right?

4597
04:25:10,460 --> 04:25:12,120
That's like a flapjack.

4598
04:25:12,540 --> 04:25:12,600
Right?

4599
04:25:12,780 --> 04:25:13,640
That's a flapjack.

4600
04:25:14,640 --> 04:25:14,700
Right?

4601
04:25:15,020 --> 04:25:16,580
I think the crispier ones?

4602
04:25:19,120 --> 04:25:21,060
What about banana pancakes, though?

4603
04:25:21,340 --> 04:25:22,860
That's my exception to pancake hate.

4604
04:25:24,120 --> 04:25:26,160
I think I'd like anything with a banana in it.

4605
04:25:27,940 --> 04:25:28,680
That's a crepe.

4606
04:25:29,700 --> 04:25:30,080
Maybe.

4607
04:25:30,560 --> 04:25:31,560
I do like crepes.

4608
04:25:31,920 --> 04:25:32,600
I like those.

4609
04:25:33,200 --> 04:25:33,760
Yeah.

4610
04:25:34,280 --> 04:25:35,440
You agree with me?

4611
04:25:35,560 --> 04:25:36,200
Thank you.

4612
04:25:39,540 --> 04:25:40,100
Anyway.

4613
04:25:41,100 --> 04:25:42,740
Neighbors make really good noodles.

4614
04:25:43,300 --> 04:25:45,560
Oh, and one of our neighbors makes a lot of bread.

4615
04:25:46,140 --> 04:25:46,900
Do you have any neighbors?

4616
04:25:47,840 --> 04:25:48,600
Mm, yes.

4617
04:25:49,640 --> 04:25:50,840
Do they share their food with you?

4618
04:25:51,560 --> 04:25:51,820
No.

4619
04:25:53,320 --> 04:25:54,840
That's not very nice of them.

4620
04:25:55,540 --> 04:26:00,800
Our neighbors and my mama take turns making food for the
whole village each day.

4621
04:26:01,960 --> 04:26:02,580
Do you...

4622
04:26:02,580 --> 04:26:04,280
Raise your hand if you know your neighbors.

4623
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:07,280
Do you know your neighbors?

4624
04:26:09,960 --> 04:26:19,680
I could be your neighbor If there's an abandoned maid cafe
Right next to you I could be your neighbor And you wouldn't

4625
04:26:19,680 --> 04:26:29,220
even know You'd be like Oh there's that abandoned maid cafe
And It could be me It could be And you would never know

4626
04:26:29,220 --> 04:26:31,040
Because you don't share your food with me

4627
04:26:34,890 --> 04:26:36,790
My neighbors are pretty far away

4628
04:26:40,510 --> 04:26:43,990
Far away neighbors That's kind of nice too, no?

4629
04:26:47,310 --> 04:26:48,590
I know their dog

4630
04:26:52,220 --> 04:26:58,940
Everyone also takes turns doing chores And watching the
little kids I don't need to be watched anymore though I'm

4631
04:26:58,940 --> 04:27:07,880
old enough to help out I miss everyone I've been gone for a
while now haven't I I wonder if they're worried about me

4632
04:27:10,500 --> 04:27:11,640
with lots of syrup.

4633
04:27:12,540 --> 04:27:15,440
I like butter on my waffles.

4634
04:27:16,240 --> 04:27:16,960
Yo, minto.

4635
04:27:17,360 --> 04:27:18,920
Darn, darn, darn, darn.

4636
04:27:18,960 --> 04:27:19,920
Welcome back.

4637
04:27:21,200 --> 04:27:22,080
Thank you.

4638
04:27:23,860 --> 04:27:25,640
Speaking of helping out, we should probably go now.

4639
04:27:26,820 --> 04:27:28,200
We'll get you back home, little buddy.

4640
04:27:30,200 --> 04:27:30,560
All right.

4641
04:27:31,440 --> 04:27:33,040
Down the elevator, we go.

4642
04:27:35,660 --> 04:27:36,040
Oh, hey.

4643
04:27:36,240 --> 04:27:36,740
Welcome back.

4644
04:27:37,820 --> 04:27:39,080
That sure took you a while, huh?

4645
04:27:39,540 --> 04:27:40,040
Oh, shoot.

4646
04:27:40,280 --> 04:27:40,480
You've been there.

4647
04:27:40,500 --> 04:27:43,560
been waiting the whole time and holding the door open?

4648
04:27:44,200 --> 04:27:45,480
I didn't want to be rude.

4649
04:27:46,140 --> 04:27:46,420
I'm sorry.

4650
04:27:46,540 --> 04:27:47,860
I should have told you to go on ahead.

4651
04:27:49,140 --> 04:27:50,560
Don't worry about it.

4652
04:27:53,840 --> 04:27:56,200
Here we go.

4653
04:28:15,430 --> 04:28:16,510
Sure it's taking a while.

4654
04:28:18,810 --> 04:28:23,170
Don't mind the maid cafe next door the ghost there has food
aggression.

4655
04:28:25,410 --> 04:28:26,830
Skately, welcome back.

4656
04:28:27,510 --> 04:28:30,090
French toast is a Superior Breakfast Bread IMO.

4657
04:28:32,070 --> 04:28:32,730
It's okay.

4658
04:28:34,390 --> 04:28:36,310
It has to be made, right?

4659
04:28:39,170 --> 04:28:43,750
Oh goodness gracious, I'm stuck in an elevator with the
Messiah and I literally god themselves.

4660
04:28:43,950 --> 04:28:44,590
This is awkward.

4661
04:28:45,650 --> 04:28:47,370
Well, maybe we can chat to pass the time then?

4662
04:28:48,170 --> 04:28:48,650
You heard me?

4663
04:28:49,290 --> 04:28:49,750
I mean, sure.

4664
04:28:50,350 --> 04:28:50,830
Alright.

4665
04:28:51,310 --> 04:28:52,310
Admito, should I...

4666
04:28:55,370 --> 04:28:57,450
Resume the awkward silence.

4667
04:28:59,770 --> 04:29:02,910
Guys, I have to use a little ghosty's room, I'm so sorry.

4668
04:29:03,550 --> 04:29:06,090
I've taken many a break of the stream, I feel.

4669
04:29:06,410 --> 04:29:07,610
Me running all over the place.

4670
04:29:08,510 --> 04:29:10,810
But I have to use the ghosty room.

4671
04:29:13,190 --> 04:29:14,470
So, um, awkward silence.

4672
04:29:20,380 --> 04:29:20,920
There we go.

4673
04:33:03,550 --> 04:33:04,250
I'm back!

4674
04:33:04,630 --> 04:33:05,110
Sorry!

4675
04:33:07,050 --> 04:33:09,090
Guys, I think I need to change my headphones.

4676
04:33:09,410 --> 04:33:11,310
Because my ears are like...

4677
04:33:12,990 --> 04:33:17,130
I need to change some of the other headphones.

4678
04:33:17,970 --> 04:33:18,690
Sorry about that.

4679
04:33:19,030 --> 04:33:20,530
I was like petting my cats too.

4680
04:33:21,310 --> 04:33:24,570
I was petting my cats.

4681
04:33:30,440 --> 04:33:31,000
Nice.

4682
04:33:31,860 --> 04:33:32,140
Yeah.

4683
04:33:33,080 --> 04:33:33,540
All right.

4684
04:33:34,080 --> 04:33:34,960
Awkward silence.

4685
04:33:39,560 --> 04:33:40,000
Nice.

4686
04:33:41,200 --> 04:33:43,320
I was just about to ask how the cats...

4687
04:33:44,200 --> 04:33:44,460
Yeah.

4688
04:33:44,880 --> 04:33:48,300
I went out earlier when I went to go get water before and...

4689
04:33:48,320 --> 04:33:49,380
They were...

4690
04:33:49,380 --> 04:33:50,640
They were...

4691
04:33:50,640 --> 04:33:54,380
They were snuggling with each other, which they don't do
like ever.

4692
04:33:54,680 --> 04:33:55,920
So I was like, oh my gosh.

4693
04:33:56,620 --> 04:33:58,020
Memboos are permanent.

4694
04:33:58,600 --> 04:33:59,080
Permanent?

4695
04:34:01,580 --> 04:34:02,760
We made it to the bot.

4696
04:34:02,880 --> 04:34:04,800
I should have probably asked about stuff, huh?

4697
04:34:08,100 --> 04:34:08,580
Superliminal!

4698
04:34:08,820 --> 04:34:09,200
You made it!

4699
04:34:09,220 --> 04:34:10,160
You got the hot dog!

4700
04:34:12,240 --> 04:34:14,440
Anyway, it was a nice meeting you.

4701
04:34:15,080 --> 04:34:15,440
Nico!

4702
04:34:16,240 --> 04:34:16,460
Right.

4703
04:34:16,860 --> 04:34:17,660
See you around, kid.

4704
04:34:18,320 --> 04:34:19,600
Gotta run, though.

4705
04:34:21,740 --> 04:34:23,260
It seems in a hurry.

4706
04:34:24,480 --> 04:34:26,520
I guess we should hurry, too, Admin, though.

4707
04:34:29,320 --> 04:34:30,240
Eternal Membu?

4708
04:34:30,440 --> 04:34:31,980
What if I turn Membu ships off?

4709
04:34:33,320 --> 04:34:34,620
People are counting on us!

4710
04:34:34,780 --> 04:34:35,840
Let's go find that library.

4711
04:34:37,940 --> 04:34:43,360
I'm not feeling like I want to stop anytime soon, but does
anyone know if I'm, like, what, halfway through the game or

4712
04:34:43,360 --> 04:34:43,640
something?

4713
04:34:44,520 --> 04:34:45,660
How far I am?

4714
04:34:48,900 --> 04:34:50,000
You would.

4715
04:34:52,500 --> 04:34:54,340
She hates money.

4716
04:34:55,780 --> 04:34:57,360
Guys, everyone's welcome back.

4717
04:34:57,760 --> 04:34:58,180
Thank you.

4718
04:34:59,460 --> 04:35:00,640
This is the last area.

4719
04:35:03,460 --> 04:35:04,180
Hello, person.

4720
04:35:04,840 --> 04:35:06,000
The library is up ahead.

4721
04:35:06,400 --> 04:35:06,860
Thanks.

4722
04:35:08,100 --> 04:35:09,440
Oh my god, crazy hair.

4723
04:35:09,700 --> 04:35:14,100
When the world ends, would it be better if it was gone in an
instant or slowly failing away?

4724
04:35:15,240 --> 04:35:17,140
To be honest, I'd rather the former.

4725
04:35:24,880 --> 04:35:25,860
More than half.

4726
04:35:25,960 --> 04:35:26,720
Just a little bit more?

4727
04:35:26,940 --> 04:35:27,720
Okay, cool.

4728
04:35:36,440 --> 04:35:37,460
This is library?

4729
04:35:37,840 --> 04:35:38,060
Cool.

4730
04:35:39,320 --> 04:35:40,760
There's so many people here.

4731
04:35:41,900 --> 04:35:42,180
What?

4732
04:35:42,920 --> 04:35:44,060
Oh, I didn't say anything.

4733
04:35:44,680 --> 04:35:45,800
Stop staring at me then.

4734
04:35:47,360 --> 04:35:48,340
I was just looking at your book.

4735
04:35:49,180 --> 04:35:50,300
Yes, you are in a library.

4736
04:35:50,460 --> 04:35:52,000
There's books in the library.

4737
04:35:53,700 --> 04:35:55,860
Go bug the chatty one upstairs.

4738
04:35:56,860 --> 04:35:57,560
My goodness.

4739
04:35:59,000 --> 04:36:00,560
The author's book cover...

4740
04:36:00,560 --> 04:36:01,120
Books cover...

4741
04:36:01,140 --> 04:36:02,440
cover a wide range of top...

4742
04:36:02,440 --> 04:36:03,300
Oh, the author!

4743
04:36:05,320 --> 04:36:07,340
It seems there are no subjects he does not write about.

4744
04:36:08,180 --> 04:36:09,600
Quite the Renaissance man, don't you think?

4745
04:36:10,100 --> 04:36:10,740
I guess so.

4746
04:36:11,320 --> 04:36:13,920
But he's been focusing on documenting the world as of late.

4747
04:36:14,540 --> 04:36:14,700
Oh?

4748
04:36:15,180 --> 04:36:17,840
I say the city is the last bastion of civilization.

4749
04:36:18,860 --> 04:36:22,880
Soon these books may be the only thing we have to remember
the rest of the world by.

4750
04:36:25,160 --> 04:36:25,400
Oh.

4751
04:36:26,640 --> 04:36:28,400
Books are neatly placed on the shelf.

4752
04:36:30,220 --> 04:36:31,120
What is he wrote?

4753
04:36:31,140 --> 04:36:31,940
write about.

4754
04:36:32,400 --> 04:36:33,380
Look how cute!

4755
04:36:34,080 --> 04:36:35,260
Still scared of ladders.

4756
04:36:35,680 --> 04:36:36,740
What the heck?

4757
04:36:39,700 --> 04:36:40,380
Hello person.

4758
04:36:40,860 --> 04:36:41,080
Hi.

4759
04:36:41,660 --> 04:36:42,820
Reshelving in progress.

4760
04:36:43,500 --> 04:36:47,280
Please watch out for potential... Oh, I guess maybe if they
drop boxes out with this one.

4761
04:36:48,480 --> 04:36:49,500
Some sort of plaque.

4762
04:36:52,060 --> 04:36:53,500
A computer is currently off.

4763
04:36:57,440 --> 04:36:58,080
Denied.

4764
04:36:59,520 --> 04:37:00,920
A photo of some people.

4765
04:37:04,220 --> 04:37:05,580
Hello, do you need directions?

4766
04:37:06,020 --> 04:37:08,540
Let's see, this area here is mostly historical accounts.

4767
04:37:08,680 --> 04:37:12,360
The reference section is downstairs, and I'm not sure where
the children section is.

4768
04:37:13,280 --> 04:37:13,740
That's okay.

4769
04:37:13,940 --> 04:37:14,960
I'm not really looking for books.

4770
04:37:15,700 --> 04:37:17,740
Oh, are you here to look for the author?

4771
04:37:18,100 --> 04:37:18,760
The author?

4772
04:37:21,380 --> 04:37:21,640
No?

4773
04:37:22,160 --> 04:37:22,940
Oh, that's good.

4774
04:37:23,280 --> 04:37:24,920
I mean, that means you won't be disappointed.

4775
04:37:25,620 --> 04:37:28,520
I've been volunteering here for months, and I've never seen
him not even once.

4776
04:37:29,100 --> 04:37:31,200
He works together with the head librarian on publishing.

4777
04:37:32,800 --> 04:37:33,760
He shows up once in a while.

4778
04:37:34,740 --> 04:37:35,460
But he doesn't?

4779
04:37:35,740 --> 04:37:37,260
Yeah, where's the dojin shape?

4780
04:37:39,860 --> 04:37:41,880
Yeah, he's kind of reclusive.

4781
04:37:42,620 --> 04:37:45,020
Which is weird for a guy who supposedly travels the world.

4782
04:37:47,800 --> 04:37:49,660
Maybe it's just around people.

4783
04:37:57,290 --> 04:37:58,850
Oh, sorry, I had to move some stuff on my computer.

4784
04:38:00,350 --> 04:38:00,750
Whoa!

4785
04:38:01,610 --> 04:38:03,370
Where are these people coming from?

4786
04:38:04,050 --> 04:38:05,410
The author is so cool.

4787
04:38:05,990 --> 04:38:08,590
I heard he can travel all over the world with a flying
machine.

4788
04:38:10,390 --> 04:38:17,850
that's how he gathers material for his books wait didn't the
kids in the Glen say that their friend had a flying machine

4789
04:38:17,850 --> 04:38:29,720
well are they friends with the author a photo of some plants

4790
04:38:36,540 --> 04:38:46,320
some sort of plaque a big book with a black clover on the
cover the title says a Comprehensive guide to phosphors.

4791
04:38:47,180 --> 04:38:48,220
I'll have to read.

4792
04:38:50,200 --> 04:38:55,020
As a general rule, if a phosphor loses its glow entirely, it
cannot be relit unless exposed to the sun.

4793
04:38:55,580 --> 04:39:00,920
If the phosphor is merely dim, it may be impossible to boost
it through exposure to another phosphor of higher energy.

4794
04:39:02,120 --> 04:39:05,280
But even so, the boosted phosphor will never return to its
original brightness.

4795
04:39:06,040 --> 04:39:09,060
A survey of phosphors found in the natural world.

4796
04:39:10,140 --> 04:39:11,200
Blue phosphor.

4797
04:39:11,980 --> 04:39:12,940
Green phosphor.

4798
04:39:14,020 --> 04:39:15,220
Red phosphor.

4799
04:39:18,340 --> 04:39:20,920
I was just making sure what it said.

4800
04:39:22,560 --> 04:39:26,220
Out of the common phosphors, blue phosphors of moderate
levels of energy.

4801
04:39:26,540 --> 04:39:28,700
It can exist in both organic and mineral forms.

4802
04:39:29,020 --> 04:39:30,120
Skip a skip a.

4803
04:39:31,860 --> 04:39:35,620
The mineral form is just because I have my headphones in.

4804
04:39:36,480 --> 04:39:37,480
My mouth is hurting.

4805
04:39:38,020 --> 04:39:39,300
I'm from talking so much.

4806
04:39:40,780 --> 04:39:40,880
Uh.

4807
04:39:46,420 --> 04:39:50,860
The mineral form is most commonly found in the metallic
sands of the barrens.

4808
04:39:51,160 --> 04:39:52,080
Yeah, yeah.

4809
04:39:53,160 --> 04:39:55,080
Live phosphor of shrimp can be used.

4810
04:40:00,120 --> 04:40:00,900
Eepy ghost.

4811
04:40:02,000 --> 04:40:02,800
Don't say eepy.

4812
04:40:03,420 --> 04:40:04,080
You can say eepy.

4813
04:40:05,460 --> 04:40:06,560
Green phosphor.

4814
04:40:06,700 --> 04:40:09,480
Out of the three common phosphors, green phosphor is the
highest energy.

4815
04:40:10,120 --> 04:40:13,200
Also, the rarest of common phosphors is only being found in
organic form.

4816
04:40:14,020 --> 04:40:17,440
Include the sap of the phosphor trees, fireflies, and
various mosses.

4817
04:40:18,220 --> 04:40:18,580
Oh.

4818
04:40:19,580 --> 04:40:21,620
Thankfully, at least locals of the Glen still have enough to
get by.

4819
04:40:22,780 --> 04:40:27,320
Ideal for industrial use, however, due to its relative
scarcity and past over-harvesting.

4820
04:40:30,860 --> 04:40:32,720
There is currently no reliable source.

4821
04:40:34,000 --> 04:40:34,760
This one, we don't know.

4822
04:40:34,820 --> 04:40:35,440
The refuge.

4823
04:40:35,600 --> 04:40:38,560
Out of the common phosphorus, red phosphorus is the lowest
energy.

4824
04:40:40,340 --> 04:40:42,800
How many times do I have to say phosphorus?

4825
04:40:44,780 --> 04:40:47,940
It exists exclusively in mineral form and can only give
light to...

4826
04:40:47,960 --> 04:40:48,920
when in solution.

4827
04:40:49,820 --> 04:40:54,820
The dilute red phosphor abundant in the city's water
channels can be concentrated and induced.

4828
04:40:55,080 --> 04:40:56,560
Wait, so how do they drink water?

4829
04:40:57,600 --> 04:41:02,320
This can create an artificial high energy state with
great... Wait, so if I drink the water,

4830
04:41:05,960 --> 04:41:07,720
I would be so...

4831
04:41:07,720 --> 04:41:09,720
It's like a crazy energy drink.

4832
04:41:10,000 --> 04:41:10,460
Red Bull!

4833
04:41:10,840 --> 04:41:12,700
The water here is red bull!

4834
04:41:17,180 --> 04:41:17,780
Probably.

4835
04:41:19,100 --> 04:41:26,120
One major caveat is that the phosphor in this in the super
saturated solution will precipitate out rather quickly.

4836
04:41:26,720 --> 04:41:30,160
As soon as the phosphor recrystallizes, it loses its glow
permanently.

4837
04:41:31,280 --> 04:41:36,640
If using super saturated red phosphors as a power source,
make sure there are proper facilities or services that can

4838
04:41:36,640 --> 04:41:37,940
replace every color.

4839
04:41:39,900 --> 04:41:40,460
Cuphead!

4840
04:41:41,860 --> 04:41:43,880
Hey, who are you calling Cuphead?

4841
04:41:46,340 --> 04:41:47,860
So what do you think about the author?

4842
04:41:48,680 --> 04:41:49,480
I don't know.

4843
04:41:50,040 --> 04:41:50,900
Have you read his stuff yet?

4844
04:41:51,760 --> 04:41:58,440
you should okay is this the author of writing these things
the author's latest novel latest books are really something

4845
04:41:58,440 --> 04:42:06,700
yeah the head librarian just released a bunch last week oh
they're big compendiums you'll see them if you look around

4846
04:42:06,700 --> 04:42:16,240
kind of different from his earlier works though i'm used to
reading reading his travel logs novels mostly nerd kid the

4847
04:42:16,240 --> 04:42:22,860
author publishes books on a highly accelerated almost
inhumane pace in fact he has put out more books in one year

4848
04:42:22,860 --> 04:42:24,580
than most authors do in a lifetime.

4849
04:42:25,600 --> 04:42:31,280
According to the head librarian, there is still a large
amount of material he has written and not yet published.

4850
04:42:32,220 --> 04:42:36,920
One cannot help but wonder where he can get so much done in
so little time.

4851
04:42:37,580 --> 04:42:41,000
I did the calculations, and the numbers simply do not add
up.

4852
04:42:41,980 --> 04:42:43,980
Maybe he can stop time.

4853
04:42:45,080 --> 04:42:46,900
No such mechanism exists in this world.

4854
04:42:48,260 --> 04:42:49,740
It is actually impossible.

4855
04:42:50,700 --> 04:42:53,500
Wait, is that actually possible in your home dimension?

4856
04:42:54,520 --> 04:42:56,220
Nah, I just saw it in a movie once.

4857
04:42:58,020 --> 04:42:59,830
About superheroes and stuff.

4858
04:43:01,640 --> 04:43:03,480
We have this big book with Black Clover.

4859
04:43:04,540 --> 04:43:07,980
Emergence of the new ecological niches in a post-sum.

4860
04:43:08,880 --> 04:43:11,660
In a post-sum world.

4861
04:43:17,980 --> 04:43:20,000
The book bored me.

4862
04:43:23,980 --> 04:43:26,020
Don't fall asleep in the title.

4863
04:43:26,540 --> 04:43:28,080
We got the phosphor shrimp.

4864
04:43:29,340 --> 04:43:30,700
Common firefly.

4865
04:43:31,200 --> 04:43:31,760
Oh, that's it.

4866
04:43:32,500 --> 04:43:33,260
We can read this.

4867
04:43:35,260 --> 04:43:40,340
Also known as seed shrimp in the certain vernaculars due to
the shape of their transparent coats.

4868
04:43:40,900 --> 04:43:46,740
These aquatic invertebrates are the most abundant life form
in the oceans surrounding the barrens.

4869
04:43:47,440 --> 04:43:48,760
0.5 centimeters.

4870
04:43:50,000 --> 04:43:51,520
That's as big as you guys!

4871
04:43:55,520 --> 04:44:02,680
A nocturnal beetle with a vibrant glow, sometimes captured
in mass and put in jars to be used as living lamps by the

4872
04:44:02,680 --> 04:44:03,560
Glen's residents.

4873
04:44:04,180 --> 04:44:07,800
This has inspired the now common practice of using
phosphorous shrimps to do the same.

4874
04:44:11,180 --> 04:44:13,120
You're going through these pages pretty fast.

4875
04:44:14,000 --> 04:44:15,240
Actually, it's mostly pictures.

4876
04:44:15,800 --> 04:44:15,940
Oh?

4877
04:44:16,440 --> 04:44:18,000
Yeah, the author doesn't only write books.

4878
04:44:18,100 --> 04:44:19,140
He also illustrates them.

4879
04:44:20,000 --> 04:44:22,280
Sometimes he makes books out of only pictures.

4880
04:44:22,300 --> 04:44:22,860
Neat!

4881
04:44:27,890 --> 04:44:29,010
For you?

4882
04:44:32,120 --> 04:44:34,660
We are one-fifth of an inch tall.

4883
04:44:36,180 --> 04:44:36,540
Yes.

4884
04:44:37,320 --> 04:44:37,940
So cute!

4885
04:44:38,480 --> 04:44:39,600
That's above average.

4886
04:44:41,920 --> 04:44:43,880
We're all so luminescent.

4887
04:44:44,460 --> 04:44:45,940
You could be probably, yeah.

4888
04:44:48,660 --> 04:44:51,660
Like a little willow wisp that glows.

4889
04:44:52,280 --> 04:44:53,420
The eye blue also glow.

4890
04:44:55,100 --> 04:44:56,600
Will I ever write a book?

4891
04:44:57,000 --> 04:45:01,600
I don't think I can and I'm not good at my words, I think.

4892
04:45:03,260 --> 04:45:06,280
You know, I've tried looking for the flying machine with my
binoculars for ages.

4893
04:45:07,000 --> 04:45:08,120
Never saw such a thing though.

4894
04:45:09,660 --> 04:45:11,880
I like how his eyes are like glinting.

4895
04:45:13,660 --> 04:45:14,020
Uh...

4896
04:45:15,300 --> 04:45:16,640
What are you doing to that book?

4897
04:45:16,760 --> 04:45:17,360
What are they doing?

4898
04:45:18,580 --> 04:45:20,840
Don't worry, these are my own books that I wrote.

4899
04:45:21,160 --> 04:45:23,400
I just pulled them off the shelves to modify them.

4900
04:45:23,660 --> 04:45:24,640
I have to cross out some seconds.

4901
04:45:26,840 --> 04:45:28,300
Are you the author?

4902
04:45:29,460 --> 04:45:30,300
Most sections.

4903
04:45:31,080 --> 04:45:31,820
Eh, I'll come.

4904
04:45:32,340 --> 04:45:34,160
Because otherwise they'll think I copied him.

4905
04:45:35,280 --> 04:45:35,340
Him?

4906
04:45:35,820 --> 04:45:36,560
The author.

4907
04:45:37,080 --> 04:45:39,580
I mean, I really don't see the point of writing anything
anymore.

4908
04:45:40,340 --> 04:45:43,300
The author is just gonna write about the same thing and then
everyone will love it.

4909
04:45:43,900 --> 04:45:46,660
Nobody's gonna remember the books that came out before his.

4910
04:45:49,120 --> 04:45:50,880
Oh, I mean, I ain't hating.

4911
04:45:51,480 --> 04:45:53,380
I can see why people go nuts over his stuff.

4912
04:45:54,660 --> 04:45:55,440
major talent.

4913
04:45:55,740 --> 04:45:57,260
I was falling asleep at his title, though.

4914
04:45:57,680 --> 04:45:59,680
But it just hurts, you know?

4915
04:46:00,280 --> 04:46:06,860
It's never fun when people call you a copycat for something
you wrote about first.

4916
04:46:08,580 --> 04:46:09,520
I can see that.

4917
04:46:10,260 --> 04:46:14,260
People call me a cat all the time, even though I'm a person
and cats are pets.

4918
04:46:15,520 --> 04:46:16,280
And mousers?

4919
04:46:18,040 --> 04:46:19,900
Why is your hope people don't think I eat mice?

4920
04:46:22,300 --> 04:46:24,020
Then I guess we're in the same boat, kiddo.

4921
04:46:29,060 --> 04:46:30,960
Robot, excuse me!

4922
04:46:31,220 --> 04:46:32,460
Oh, you are the Messiah.

4923
04:46:33,160 --> 04:46:33,500
Welcome.

4924
04:46:34,260 --> 04:46:38,760
When I first entered the city, a big robot told me to look
for a library on the surface.

4925
04:46:39,380 --> 04:46:40,680
This is the same library, right?

4926
04:46:44,180 --> 04:46:48,280
This game came out on Steam around the same time as
Undertale, though the original is older.

4927
04:46:48,420 --> 04:46:49,740
I think this guy is...

4928
04:46:49,740 --> 04:46:54,260
This guy is a statement on how some probably thought the
devil was copying the Undertale.

4929
04:46:54,560 --> 04:46:55,620
Oh no!

4930
04:46:57,560 --> 04:47:00,440
You can't make an RPG maker game anymore.

4931
04:47:01,200 --> 04:47:01,980
There's not...

4932
04:47:01,980 --> 04:47:03,560
How is this a copy of Undertale?

4933
04:47:04,100 --> 04:47:05,920
There's no combat or anything in this.

4934
04:47:10,300 --> 04:47:11,480
Mice cheese?

4935
04:47:12,280 --> 04:47:12,880
Pancakes.

4936
04:47:13,820 --> 04:47:14,180
Yeah.

4937
04:47:15,500 --> 04:47:16,480
Not the meta one.

4938
04:47:16,560 --> 04:47:18,380
Yeah, you can't make a meta game anymore.

4939
04:47:23,480 --> 04:47:25,600
Quirky RPG equals Undertale.

4940
04:47:25,820 --> 04:47:26,180
No!

4941
04:47:26,420 --> 04:47:27,540
And then quirky...

4942
04:47:28,460 --> 04:47:31,840
quirky visual novel is Doki Doki Literature Club.

4943
04:47:33,440 --> 04:47:37,040
And you think that's a little meta and kind of horror is
Doki Doki Literature Club.

4944
04:47:46,480 --> 04:47:46,920
Affirmative.

4945
04:47:47,280 --> 04:47:47,980
Oh, goody.

4946
04:47:48,240 --> 04:47:48,900
Well, we're here.

4947
04:47:49,000 --> 04:47:49,680
What do we do now?

4948
04:47:51,180 --> 04:47:51,840
The big robot.

4949
04:47:52,000 --> 04:47:52,440
Robot.

4950
04:47:52,620 --> 04:47:52,900
Robot.

4951
04:47:53,220 --> 04:47:54,580
Oh, they said there'd be clues here.

4952
04:47:56,000 --> 04:47:57,680
That is a question for the head librarian.

4953
04:47:58,140 --> 04:47:58,580
George.

4954
04:47:59,320 --> 04:48:00,380
Allow me to call her.

4955
04:48:01,400 --> 04:48:01,840
George?

4956
04:48:02,300 --> 04:48:02,980
Get on the phone.

4957
04:48:04,500 --> 04:48:33,330
dialed to George big robot she is not picking up is she not
here she is here she is in the archival room upstairs when

4958
04:48:33,330 --> 04:48:41,990
she is concentrating on her work she will ignore any and all
phone calls for several days oh no Yikes.

4959
04:48:43,390 --> 04:48:44,690
Can you go get her in person then?

4960
04:48:45,290 --> 04:48:46,970
Leaving this post is not in my programming.

4961
04:48:47,590 --> 04:48:48,370
Then can I go myself?

4962
04:48:48,970 --> 04:48:49,450
Of course.

4963
04:48:49,910 --> 04:48:52,570
The archival room is accessible through the stairwell behind
me.

4964
04:48:53,050 --> 04:48:53,770
Gotcha, thanks.

4965
04:48:54,910 --> 04:48:55,550
Who are you?

4966
04:48:55,790 --> 04:48:58,770
Oh, I thought he was smoking like a bubble pipe.

4967
04:49:00,610 --> 04:49:01,770
I'm on my third cup.

4968
04:49:02,570 --> 04:49:03,730
I can't feel my limbs.

4969
04:49:04,010 --> 04:49:04,930
Oh my gosh.

4970
04:49:05,250 --> 04:49:06,090
But I have to stay awake.

4971
04:49:06,610 --> 04:49:08,350
I need to find out how this book ends.

4972
04:49:10,070 --> 04:49:12,170
Curse the author in his beautiful cliffhangers.

4973
04:49:16,420 --> 04:49:17,400
A bubble pipe.

4974
04:49:18,640 --> 04:49:19,300
Unauthorized entry.

4975
04:49:19,880 --> 04:49:21,740
Library card required for further access.

4976
04:49:22,200 --> 04:49:22,580
Wait, what?

4977
04:49:23,240 --> 04:49:25,160
Library card required for further access.

4978
04:49:25,540 --> 04:49:27,000
I don't have a library card, though.

4979
04:49:27,540 --> 04:49:28,320
Where can I get one?

4980
04:49:28,640 --> 04:49:30,640
This is a question for the head librarian, George.

4981
04:49:31,400 --> 04:49:32,240
Allow me...

4982
04:49:32,240 --> 04:49:32,980
No, please.

4983
04:49:33,140 --> 04:49:33,640
No, I didn't.

4984
04:49:34,520 --> 04:49:36,200
Dang it, I was just trying to get to the other side.

4985
04:49:45,890 --> 04:49:46,330
Me.

4986
04:49:56,140 --> 04:50:03,040
she is not picking up i figured are you sure you can't just
let me through letting you through without a library card is

4987
04:50:03,040 --> 04:50:11,060
against my programming oh my god someone tamed this guy oh
i'm gonna tame you i'm gonna tame you little robot even in

4988
04:50:11,060 --> 04:50:13,860
an emergency my programming is not flexible

4989
04:50:18,580 --> 04:50:19,280
been tamed.

4990
04:50:21,140 --> 04:50:21,400
Ugh.

4991
04:50:23,040 --> 04:50:24,800
What do you mean I'm making it sound weird?

4992
04:50:25,040 --> 04:50:26,660
I'm literally just saying what it is.

4993
04:50:27,680 --> 04:50:28,320
Coffee cups.

4994
04:50:28,520 --> 04:50:29,620
Coffee is for grown-ups.

4995
04:50:30,460 --> 04:50:32,060
I could do some coffee right now.

4996
04:50:38,460 --> 04:50:38,940
Okay.

4997
04:50:48,060 --> 04:50:49,640
Maybe I talk to him one more time.

4998
04:50:50,920 --> 04:50:52,820
I'm guessing you don't give out library cards.

4999
04:50:54,220 --> 04:50:56,060
I only handle book transactions.

5000
04:50:59,770 --> 04:51:02,090
For people who already possess cards.

5001
04:51:02,610 --> 04:51:02,750
Ah.

5002
04:51:03,310 --> 04:51:06,250
To acquire a card, you need to contact the head librarian,
George.

5003
04:51:06,770 --> 04:51:07,210
No.

5004
04:51:07,570 --> 04:51:07,810
No!

5005
04:51:07,990 --> 04:51:08,410
Don't call!

5006
04:51:09,170 --> 04:51:09,470
Okay.

5007
04:51:10,330 --> 04:51:10,770
Alright.

5008
04:51:11,770 --> 04:51:12,430
We'll figure...

5009
04:51:12,430 --> 04:51:13,530
Wait, is there anything?

5010
04:51:14,530 --> 04:51:14,970
No.

5011
04:51:15,630 --> 04:51:18,950
Wait, maybe I wonder... The strange journal.

5012
04:51:21,810 --> 04:51:22,250
Oh!

5013
04:51:22,470 --> 04:51:24,830
There's a book I found back at the Barron's area.

5014
04:51:25,250 --> 04:51:27,450
Since this is a place for books, would you happen to know
what it says?

5015
04:51:27,770 --> 04:51:32,050
I do not recognize this language, but the symbols on the
cover is of importance.

5016
04:51:32,510 --> 04:51:32,710
What?

5017
04:51:33,130 --> 04:51:34,850
The head librarian George can explain that.

5018
04:51:35,130 --> 04:51:36,090
Would you like me to call her?

5019
04:51:36,650 --> 04:51:36,950
Don't.

5020
04:51:37,630 --> 04:51:37,930
Okay.

5021
04:51:39,230 --> 04:51:39,650
Hmm.

5022
04:51:40,990 --> 04:51:42,670
Yeah, if only we had a crowbar.

5023
04:51:43,450 --> 04:51:46,610
And then we could bash his head in and go, you know.

5024
04:51:48,590 --> 04:51:50,210
Make things a little bit easier.

5025
04:51:51,790 --> 04:51:52,550
Alright, everybody.

5026
04:51:53,330 --> 04:51:55,690
Time for your Red Bull!

5027
04:52:04,990 --> 04:52:06,110
Um, I don't remember.

5028
04:52:06,210 --> 04:52:07,090
We were in there for so long.

5029
04:52:07,110 --> 04:52:09,490
I don't remember where we came from.

5030
04:52:11,290 --> 04:52:12,430
It's locked from the inside.

5031
04:52:13,830 --> 04:52:14,550
Is that the tower?

5032
04:52:16,110 --> 04:52:17,230
Wait, it might be.

5033
04:52:21,500 --> 04:52:23,020
This is where I came from.

5034
04:52:23,260 --> 04:52:24,340
Oh, no, it's not.

5035
04:52:25,460 --> 04:52:25,760
Hello.

5036
04:52:25,960 --> 04:52:26,400
Fish aid.

5037
04:52:26,900 --> 04:52:27,980
The big fish tank.

5038
04:52:28,980 --> 04:52:29,340
Hey there.

5039
04:52:30,500 --> 04:52:31,720
You have a lot of fish?

5040
04:52:32,400 --> 04:52:33,660
Yeah, I'm worried about them.

5041
04:52:36,820 --> 04:52:37,680
Red bull.

5042
04:52:39,060 --> 04:52:39,440
Oh.

5043
04:52:39,820 --> 04:52:43,420
I heard something about how square particle stuff just took
out a major pipeline.

5044
04:52:44,360 --> 04:52:47,080
I guess I should take advantage of the running water while I
still can.

5045
04:52:47,280 --> 04:52:47,820
Oh, no!

5046
04:52:50,060 --> 04:52:51,940
The world is disintegrated.

5047
04:52:52,060 --> 04:52:52,880
What's this guy doing?

5048
04:52:53,960 --> 04:52:54,580
Evening news!

5049
04:52:54,740 --> 04:52:55,520
Evening news!

5050
04:52:55,940 --> 04:52:57,200
Are you here to purchase a copy?

5051
04:52:57,860 --> 04:52:58,220
No?

5052
04:52:58,880 --> 04:53:00,420
Newspapers are for grown-ups.

5053
04:53:01,020 --> 04:53:01,980
Grown-ups?

5054
04:53:02,560 --> 04:53:02,860
Yeah!

5055
04:53:03,360 --> 04:53:04,240
What does that mean?

5056
04:53:04,760 --> 04:53:06,240
It means people who aren't kids.

5057
04:53:07,460 --> 04:53:07,860
Kids?

5058
04:53:08,780 --> 04:53:09,740
Aren't you a kid?

5059
04:53:09,820 --> 04:53:11,320
I am a robot!

5060
04:53:12,020 --> 04:53:12,360
Right.

5061
04:53:14,240 --> 04:53:15,360
Extra, extra!

5062
04:53:16,000 --> 04:53:17,980
Read all about it!

5063
04:53:21,040 --> 04:53:23,000
This is telling me to go up here.

5064
04:53:27,090 --> 04:53:28,350
Nico, be careful!

5065
04:53:34,450 --> 04:53:36,390
Admito, did you see what happened?

5066
04:53:37,310 --> 04:53:37,550
Yeah?

5067
04:53:38,150 --> 04:53:39,550
My vision went blank for a second.

5068
04:53:40,270 --> 04:53:41,110
And then I saw something?

5069
04:53:41,670 --> 04:53:42,810
Like a really short dream.

5070
04:53:43,710 --> 04:53:45,710
I wonder what that was about.

5071
04:53:52,560 --> 04:53:53,840
Faded flyer.

5072
04:53:54,460 --> 04:53:56,000
Faded flyer.

5073
04:53:59,430 --> 04:54:03,050
A curious marking on the wall.

5074
04:54:04,050 --> 04:54:05,030
Looks like a ram?

5075
04:54:11,810 --> 04:54:12,450
Whoa.

5076
04:54:13,190 --> 04:54:14,430
Strangely warm in this room.

5077
04:54:14,570 --> 04:54:15,870
Look at all the kitties!

5078
04:54:18,030 --> 04:54:19,810
Oh my gosh!

5079
04:54:21,470 --> 04:54:22,750
Oh, a cat.

5080
04:54:23,330 --> 04:54:24,130
Are you lost?

5081
04:54:24,590 --> 04:54:24,910
Me?

5082
04:54:25,690 --> 04:54:26,330
wish to join?

5083
04:54:26,430 --> 04:54:27,890
Oh my god, what he thinks we're a cat.

5084
04:54:29,090 --> 04:54:30,030
Join your cats?

5085
04:54:31,030 --> 04:54:31,390
Yes.

5086
04:54:32,250 --> 04:54:33,090
But I'm not a cat.

5087
04:54:35,350 --> 04:54:36,930
I don't walk on four legs like they do.

5088
04:54:37,730 --> 04:54:38,710
You have cat eyes.

5089
04:54:39,230 --> 04:54:41,070
My eyes are normal people eyes.

5090
04:54:42,090 --> 04:54:43,370
Well, normal back home.

5091
04:54:43,990 --> 04:54:45,350
Your hat is shaped like a cat.

5092
04:54:46,150 --> 04:54:47,010
But I'm a person.

5093
04:54:50,710 --> 04:54:52,410
You are still welcome here.

5094
04:54:52,710 --> 04:54:54,330
I protect lost people as well.

5095
04:54:54,950 --> 04:54:55,430
Thanks.

5096
04:54:55,690 --> 04:54:57,190
But I'm not lost though.

5097
04:54:57,890 --> 04:54:59,230
I've got, I mean to the guide me.

5098
04:54:59,550 --> 04:55:01,010
Oh, but what if I'm lost?

5099
04:55:01,830 --> 04:55:02,850
I see.

5100
04:55:15,820 --> 04:55:17,240
I'm lost, I think.

5101
04:55:17,940 --> 04:55:18,600
What's up here?

5102
04:55:22,100 --> 04:55:23,200
More alleyway.

5103
04:55:24,500 --> 04:55:24,660
Ugh.

5104
04:55:25,300 --> 04:55:27,640
There's so much bag full of trash.

5105
04:55:32,230 --> 04:55:32,870
Oh!

5106
04:55:33,270 --> 04:55:34,510
What's happening here?

5107
04:55:35,130 --> 04:55:35,450
Please!

5108
04:55:36,410 --> 04:55:37,490
Do not approach!

5109
04:55:40,950 --> 04:55:42,030
That guy...

5110
04:55:42,030 --> 04:55:44,630
He's getting eaten by the... by the blocks!

5111
04:55:46,190 --> 04:55:48,080
Wait, this is the fox we just saw.

5112
04:55:49,190 --> 04:55:49,510
Whoa!

5113
04:55:49,910 --> 04:55:51,450
Adminto, did you see that fox just now?

5114
04:55:52,050 --> 04:55:53,690
Just ran up... ran behind that tree.

5115
04:55:57,580 --> 04:55:59,480
I'm sorry if you were looking for me.

5116
04:56:02,580 --> 04:56:04,360
But I cannot talk to you.

5117
04:56:05,320 --> 04:56:07,120
No, he's Minecrafting!

5118
04:56:07,260 --> 04:56:07,620
No!

5119
04:56:09,100 --> 04:56:11,520
I want to be Minecrafting!

5120
04:56:12,300 --> 04:56:18,020

5121
04:56:21,760 --> 04:56:32,740

5122
04:56:37,390 --> 04:56:43,630

5123
04:56:47,410 --> 04:56:48,250
Oh my gosh, this...

5124
04:56:48,250 --> 04:56:51,510
I mean, I know we're in, like, a city, but this area is so
big.

5125
04:56:52,330 --> 04:56:53,070
Holy cow.

5126
04:56:55,630 --> 04:56:56,170
What's this?

5127
04:56:57,210 --> 04:56:59,710
Some big plastic discs in here.

5128
04:57:00,770 --> 04:57:02,150
Looks like they're supposed to go in something?

5129
04:57:03,410 --> 04:57:04,910
Are we really gonna take these with us?

5130
04:57:05,370 --> 04:57:06,430
They look so heavy.

5131
04:57:06,630 --> 04:57:08,510
You carry dirt around.

5132
04:57:12,550 --> 04:57:13,730
They're actually pretty light.

5133
04:57:16,910 --> 04:57:18,250
Jar full of red glowing liquid.

5134
04:57:19,490 --> 04:57:20,830
Frame photo of someone.

5135
04:57:21,810 --> 04:57:22,550
Lantern plant.

5136
04:57:23,170 --> 04:57:23,990
There's a note attached.

5137
04:57:24,250 --> 04:57:26,930
It says, thank you for working so hard, Mr. Lamp Lighter.

5138
04:57:29,750 --> 04:57:30,570
Big book.

5139
04:57:31,050 --> 04:57:32,810
The title says, Understanding Robots.

5140
04:57:34,310 --> 04:57:34,550
Okay.

5141
04:57:35,770 --> 04:57:36,930
I don't think we can't take it, right?

5142
04:57:38,550 --> 04:57:39,310
Nope, okay.

5143
04:57:49,860 --> 04:57:52,640
Hey kid, want some soup dumpling...

5144
04:57:52,640 --> 04:57:53,780
Oh, that sounds good.

5145
04:57:54,140 --> 04:57:57,400
They're guaranteed to contain only a minimal amount of
industrial byproducts.

5146
04:57:58,460 --> 04:57:59,580
Oh, pass.

5147
04:58:01,400 --> 04:58:02,600
Soup dumplings.

5148
04:58:04,820 --> 04:58:06,960
I love microplastic!

5149
04:58:08,720 --> 04:58:10,000
This smells kind of nice.

5150
04:58:10,360 --> 04:58:10,920
What is it?

5151
04:58:11,460 --> 04:58:12,380
Breaded fish.

5152
04:58:12,620 --> 04:58:14,260
I toasted the bread myself.

5153
04:58:17,040 --> 04:58:18,000
I see.

5154
04:58:22,530 --> 04:58:23,670
I'd still hear that.

5155
04:58:24,590 --> 04:58:25,690
Are you here for your photos?

5156
04:58:26,330 --> 04:58:26,550
No?

5157
04:58:27,050 --> 04:58:27,790
Alrighty then.

5158
04:58:28,170 --> 04:58:30,150
I'll just, uh, stand here.

5159
04:58:30,390 --> 04:58:31,030
Wait, is this a door?

5160
04:58:31,430 --> 04:58:31,910
Oh, it is.

5161
04:58:33,190 --> 04:58:34,550
A slot here.

5162
04:58:34,950 --> 04:58:37,590
Looks like paper or something might come out from it.

5163
04:58:39,570 --> 04:58:40,750
Didn't do anything.

5164
04:58:43,270 --> 04:58:44,810
Wait, these look like...

5165
04:58:46,450 --> 04:58:47,790
Looks like something could fit in there.

5166
04:58:50,590 --> 04:58:53,950
Oh, you got several kinds of lenses, I just noticed.

5167
04:59:04,370 --> 04:59:05,950
Watch me one-shot this.

5168
04:59:10,570 --> 04:59:11,810
That's the name of the game.

5169
04:59:15,330 --> 04:59:15,390
Oh!

5170
04:59:16,270 --> 04:59:18,450
I guess that wasn't the right combination.

5171
04:59:21,930 --> 04:59:22,970
Title drop!

5172
04:59:27,370 --> 04:59:28,730
I almost did it, though.

5173
04:59:30,030 --> 04:59:31,890
This stand smells a bit like burnt sugar.

5174
04:59:33,310 --> 04:59:35,550
Yep, still getting the hang of making these fried candy
skewers.

5175
04:59:36,870 --> 04:59:37,910
They don't taste too bad, though.

5176
04:59:37,990 --> 04:59:38,410
Do you want one?

5177
04:59:38,930 --> 04:59:40,050
It's okay, but thank you.

5178
04:59:42,550 --> 04:59:43,170
Hey, hi!

5179
04:59:43,470 --> 04:59:45,170
Ready for me to blow your mind?

5180
04:59:45,910 --> 04:59:46,310
Yes.

5181
04:59:51,000 --> 04:59:52,740
You don't need anything else for that puzzle?

5182
04:59:52,880 --> 04:59:54,480
It's not going to give me a hint or anything, though.

5183
04:59:55,060 --> 04:59:59,340
Okay, so I've invented a medicine to prepare everyone for
the upcoming water shortage.

5184
04:59:59,500 --> 05:00:02,360
All you got to do is dissolve one of these pills in water.

5185
05:00:03,660 --> 05:00:04,660
And then you drink the water.

5186
05:00:05,240 --> 05:00:06,900
Then you never need to drink water again.

5187
05:00:07,420 --> 05:00:08,740
This is what I need for the...

5188
05:00:08,740 --> 05:00:10,060
For the...

5189
05:00:10,060 --> 05:00:10,100
For the...

5190
05:00:10,820 --> 05:00:11,740
For the kernel!

5191
05:00:13,820 --> 05:00:14,180
What?

5192
05:00:14,660 --> 05:00:16,340
It also makes plants grow faster.

5193
05:00:17,060 --> 05:00:18,000
How does it work?

5194
05:00:18,940 --> 05:00:20,340
Here, why don't you take a free sample?

5195
05:00:21,460 --> 05:00:22,100
Oh, thanks.

5196
05:00:22,540 --> 05:00:23,020
Don't thank me.

5197
05:00:23,120 --> 05:00:24,060
Go spread the word!

5198
05:00:26,060 --> 05:00:26,460
Way!

5199
05:00:26,880 --> 05:00:27,620
Oh my gosh!

5200
05:00:28,880 --> 05:00:29,480
Goes in water.

5201
05:00:29,500 --> 05:00:30,300
water supposedly.

5202
05:00:30,660 --> 05:00:32,760
But like, wouldn't you have to keep taking it?

5203
05:00:35,360 --> 05:00:36,740
Pill in the water.

5204
05:00:39,500 --> 05:00:40,820
Medicated water.

5205
05:00:41,260 --> 05:00:41,260
Okay.

5206
05:00:42,420 --> 05:00:43,480
Maybe we go back.

5207
05:00:44,780 --> 05:00:45,360
Sparkly.

5208
05:00:53,420 --> 05:00:53,820
Spooky?

5209
05:00:55,540 --> 05:00:56,300
Spooky.

5210
05:00:57,420 --> 05:00:58,180
Spooky.

5211
05:00:58,520 --> 05:00:59,240
Wait, where am I?

5212
05:01:00,840 --> 05:01:01,240
Oh.

5213
05:01:01,840 --> 05:01:02,660
What is this?

5214
05:01:03,060 --> 05:01:03,620
Locked.

5215
05:01:04,260 --> 05:01:05,040
And ordered again.

5216
05:01:05,380 --> 05:01:09,360
Further access to the labs, you must pass the security
system test.

5217
05:01:09,420 --> 05:01:09,800
Uh-huh.

5218
05:01:10,180 --> 05:01:14,080
You must change the color of the lights into a specific
configuration.

5219
05:01:14,580 --> 05:01:15,460
Allow me.

5220
05:01:16,600 --> 05:01:22,070
Two lights correct.

5221
05:01:23,370 --> 05:01:23,650
Wait.

5222
05:01:32,000 --> 05:01:33,480
Oh, A-tr- Wait.

5223
05:01:34,340 --> 05:01:34,660
Wait.

5224
05:01:35,100 --> 05:01:35,400
Oh.

5225
05:01:36,100 --> 05:01:36,580
Oh.

5226
05:01:37,240 --> 05:01:37,620
Oh.

5227
05:01:39,860 --> 05:01:40,500
Okay.

5228
05:01:40,880 --> 05:01:42,720
There must be a hint for this one.

5229
05:01:42,760 --> 05:01:43,180
I won't keep going.

5230
05:01:43,200 --> 05:01:43,480
going.

5231
05:01:45,140 --> 05:01:45,680
Thank you for the stream.

5232
05:01:45,800 --> 05:01:49,500
I wish you the best for... By the way, never be afraid to
share your thoughts and opinions because there's no reason

5233
05:01:49,500 --> 05:01:50,240
to be scared of.

5234
05:01:51,280 --> 05:01:52,840
Take care and golden sleep.

5235
05:01:52,940 --> 05:01:53,640
Come even though.

5236
05:01:53,740 --> 05:01:54,820
Mobius, thank you.

5237
05:01:55,320 --> 05:01:56,140
Good night.

5238
05:01:57,180 --> 05:01:58,240
Sleep tight.

5239
05:01:59,000 --> 05:02:00,480
Sweet dreams.

5240
05:02:05,870 --> 05:02:12,910
The luminescence index of red liquid phosphor decreased by a
factor of 3.57% this past week.

5241
05:02:15,910 --> 05:02:17,130
Wait, is it Wirtle?

5242
05:02:17,370 --> 05:02:18,290
It's just Wirtle.

5243
05:02:21,110 --> 05:02:22,070
Alarming to say the least.

5244
05:02:22,490 --> 05:02:24,090
I didn't realize it would reset it, though.

5245
05:02:24,190 --> 05:02:26,070
I thought it was, like, one and done.

5246
05:02:26,510 --> 05:02:28,030
So, okay, we can try it then.

5247
05:02:29,830 --> 05:02:32,890
That's the sharpest decline I've seen, and the number is
only increasing.

5248
05:02:33,710 --> 05:02:37,170
We'll have to further concentrate the phosphor now, for it
will be...

5249
05:02:37,170 --> 05:02:38,330
For it to be of any use.

5250
05:02:38,510 --> 05:02:43,330
It's hard to believe, but there's a good chance the city
could run out of light in as little of six months!

5251
05:02:43,750 --> 05:02:44,830
What are we going to do?

5252
05:02:47,070 --> 05:02:48,310
That don't sound good.

5253
05:02:49,990 --> 05:02:50,950
Oh, okay, we're here.

5254
05:02:54,190 --> 05:02:56,230
It may help you to go one color at a time.

5255
05:02:58,290 --> 05:02:58,690
Beep, boop.

5256
05:02:59,090 --> 05:03:01,390
This is the printer room where machine parts are made.

5257
05:03:01,830 --> 05:03:02,370
Also robots.

5258
05:03:05,430 --> 05:03:07,490
It can also help to write down previous attempts.

5259
05:03:07,630 --> 05:03:08,030
Management.

5260
05:03:13,500 --> 05:03:14,440
They're backseating me?

5261
05:03:16,860 --> 05:03:18,100
I don't appreciate this.

5262
05:03:18,140 --> 05:03:18,540
backseating.

5263
05:03:19,820 --> 05:03:21,700
I didn't ask for your help.

5264
05:03:22,140 --> 05:03:23,860
If all else fails, wait for the puzzle to reset.

5265
05:03:24,100 --> 05:03:25,640
Maybe you'll get an easier one next time.

5266
05:03:35,090 --> 05:03:36,670
I don't remember what I tried.

5267
05:03:41,460 --> 05:03:42,760
Three lights correct.

5268
05:03:46,780 --> 05:03:48,660
I should have done one at a time, huh?

5269
05:03:49,460 --> 05:03:51,580
So I believe these two are right.

5270
05:03:56,000 --> 05:03:56,520
Never mind.

5271
05:04:06,130 --> 05:04:06,810
I want to redo.

5272
05:04:07,330 --> 05:04:08,670
Because I don't remember what I changed.

5273
05:04:19,570 --> 05:04:20,330
I'm just...

5274
05:04:26,580 --> 05:04:27,440
That's fine.

5275
05:04:27,980 --> 05:04:28,720
We'll just restart.

5276
05:04:30,060 --> 05:04:31,000
Intruder detected!

5277
05:04:31,320 --> 05:04:32,720
Resetting lock mechanism!

5278
05:04:34,600 --> 05:04:34,760
Okay.

5279
05:04:36,280 --> 05:04:37,240
Time to start over.

5280
05:04:37,500 --> 05:04:38,170
Alright, here we go.

5281
05:04:41,300 --> 05:04:42,420
Zero lights correct.

5282
05:04:42,540 --> 05:04:43,680
Okay, so it's...

5283
05:04:43,680 --> 05:04:45,120
None of them are orange.

5284
05:04:47,360 --> 05:04:47,640
Wait.

5285
05:04:49,260 --> 05:04:51,520
Let's see if we can figure out how many are blue.

5286
05:04:51,900 --> 05:04:52,960
Two lights are blue.

5287
05:04:59,210 --> 05:05:02,290
This might be stupid, but...

5288
05:05:02,290 --> 05:05:03,650
None of them are green!

5289
05:05:09,210 --> 05:05:10,870
So they're only pink and blue.

5290
05:05:18,460 --> 05:05:18,960
Wait, what?

5291
05:05:21,920 --> 05:05:24,020
It didn't it say two were wrong?

5292
05:05:24,380 --> 05:05:24,560
Wait.

5293
05:05:25,180 --> 05:05:26,180
Oh, two were correct!

5294
05:05:26,560 --> 05:05:28,400
Oh, I thought it said zero were correct.

5295
05:05:37,380 --> 05:05:38,560
Too blue, too.

5296
05:05:43,840 --> 05:05:46,080
Should I have done the colorblind mode?

5297
05:05:48,880 --> 05:05:49,200
Maybe.

5298
05:05:54,960 --> 05:05:57,000
Okay, so this one is definitely blue.

5299
05:06:02,950 --> 05:06:03,130
Oh!

5300
05:06:04,290 --> 05:06:05,970
Okay, so it's green, blue.

5301
05:06:09,910 --> 05:06:10,350
Okay, okay.

5302
05:06:11,330 --> 05:06:11,690
Okay.

5303
05:06:15,840 --> 05:06:16,520
Okay, okay!

5304
05:06:18,840 --> 05:06:20,720
Let's try pink for this one.

5305
05:06:28,040 --> 05:06:29,360
So it's still, okay.

5306
05:06:30,360 --> 05:06:31,280
Maybe this one's green.

5307
05:06:49,860 --> 05:06:50,420
Yippee!

5308
05:06:51,900 --> 05:06:53,040
I did it.

5309
05:06:54,160 --> 05:06:55,940
I'm a genius, I'm a genius, I'm a genius.

5310
05:06:56,960 --> 05:06:57,920
Oh my god!

5311
05:06:59,260 --> 05:06:59,840
My robot!

5312
05:07:00,640 --> 05:07:01,080
What happened?

5313
05:07:06,890 --> 05:07:08,570
Do not approach!

5314
05:07:16,270 --> 05:07:16,910
Uh...

5315
05:07:16,910 --> 05:07:19,630
Do we help or...

5316
05:07:19,630 --> 05:07:21,030
Oh, okay.

5317
05:07:23,110 --> 05:07:23,990
Hello, scientists.

5318
05:07:24,450 --> 05:07:25,270
Monitoring, monitoring.

5319
05:07:27,490 --> 05:07:28,630
Yeah, science!

5320
05:07:29,330 --> 05:07:32,770
Ah, those squared particles just took out two of my robots
in the Glen.

5321
05:07:33,430 --> 05:07:35,850
We might have to put off the water analysis project for now.

5322
05:07:38,690 --> 05:07:42,270
The Baron's engineer have reported another sighting of the
particles in the cliff area.

5323
05:07:42,290 --> 05:07:45,010
Well, nothing unusual at this point.

5324
05:07:46,270 --> 05:07:48,550
I'm picking up some more disruptions and such a raid of the
city.

5325
05:07:49,390 --> 05:07:51,010
This is consistent with our earlier findings.

5326
05:07:51,290 --> 05:07:52,030
Not good at all.

5327
05:07:55,670 --> 05:07:56,110
Tidhead!

5328
05:07:59,170 --> 05:08:01,030
She says, forgetting the statement about no...

5329
05:08:01,030 --> 05:08:01,350
Shh!

5330
05:08:10,860 --> 05:08:11,300
Cease!

5331
05:08:12,540 --> 05:08:14,700
I wonder what the author would do in this situation.

5332
05:08:15,260 --> 05:08:17,340
Dr. Silverpoint usually references his works.

5333
05:08:19,460 --> 05:08:20,980
None of us have been sleeping very well.

5334
05:08:21,000 --> 05:08:22,380
well in light of recent events.

5335
05:08:22,940 --> 05:08:27,760
The square particles took out a few of my robots last week,
and...

5336
05:08:27,760 --> 05:08:28,580
She fell asleep.

5337
05:08:31,500 --> 05:08:33,480
I can barely keep my eyes open, man!

5338
05:08:33,840 --> 05:08:35,880
How does Dr. Silverpoint get all that energy?

5339
05:08:38,640 --> 05:08:41,520
These robots are malfunctioning at a frightening rate!

5340
05:08:42,140 --> 05:08:42,540
Oh my god!

5341
05:08:43,400 --> 05:08:45,560
Do you think that sheep was a robot?

5342
05:08:46,860 --> 05:08:50,400
Physical damage from square particle anomalies is almost
impossible to revert.

5343
05:08:51,000 --> 05:08:53,700
No living person can touch them unless they have a death
wish.

5344
05:08:54,480 --> 05:08:57,280
But if we're lucky, sometimes the squares go away on their
own.

5345
05:09:00,600 --> 05:09:05,060
But not before taking away one of my robot's arms or legs or
head.

5346
05:09:07,760 --> 05:09:09,060
I cannot stop spinning.

5347
05:09:11,140 --> 05:09:13,040
Ah, this is so tedious.

5348
05:09:13,860 --> 05:09:15,320
I thought they were shaking hands.

5349
05:09:16,120 --> 05:09:19,460
I missed the good old days before our robot repairing robots
broke down.

5350
05:09:21,000 --> 05:09:22,500
to be assembled by actual people.

5351
05:09:23,400 --> 05:09:24,160
But aren't you a robot?

5352
05:09:24,800 --> 05:09:25,200
No?

5353
05:09:25,680 --> 05:09:27,700
I mean, do I sound like a robot to you?

5354
05:09:28,700 --> 05:09:29,260
Not really.

5355
05:09:29,700 --> 05:09:30,660
But your head is a TV.

5356
05:09:31,720 --> 05:09:32,920
What does that have to do with anything?

5357
05:09:34,580 --> 05:09:35,160
Never mind.

5358
05:09:38,000 --> 05:09:41,200
You can't just ask someone if they're a robot, Nico.

5359
05:09:44,040 --> 05:09:44,440
Hello?

5360
05:09:47,220 --> 05:09:47,980
Oh, shoot.

5361
05:09:49,260 --> 05:09:53,080
If I had known you would be here so soon, I would have
turned off the darn lock!

5362
05:09:53,780 --> 05:09:54,360
Hello there.

5363
05:09:54,760 --> 05:09:56,660
Sorry about the weird security measures.

5364
05:09:57,600 --> 05:09:58,000
It's okay.

5365
05:09:59,040 --> 05:10:00,080
Adminto helped me solve it.

5366
05:10:00,180 --> 05:10:00,680
Yeah, I did.

5367
05:10:00,840 --> 05:10:02,540
Actually, I did all of it.

5368
05:10:02,600 --> 05:10:03,940
Nico, please give me more credit.

5369
05:10:09,250 --> 05:10:11,910
Actually, I did, like, all of it.

5370
05:10:12,890 --> 05:10:13,290
Nico.

5371
05:10:17,000 --> 05:10:18,120
Did they now?

5372
05:10:19,060 --> 05:10:20,360
So, can I help you with anything?

5373
05:10:21,020 --> 05:10:21,300
Yeah.

5374
05:10:21,660 --> 05:10:23,340
Do you know how I can get a library card?

5375
05:10:24,060 --> 05:10:25,380
A library card.

5376
05:10:27,480 --> 05:10:30,700
Nico pushed the buttons, though, only because I could not.

5377
05:10:34,360 --> 05:10:36,080
You'll have to ask the library for that.

5378
05:10:36,740 --> 05:10:37,260
I tried.

5379
05:10:37,520 --> 05:10:41,680
I needed to see the head librarian, but I can't get her to
see her without a library card.

5380
05:10:42,420 --> 05:10:45,400
But at the same time, she's the only one who gives out
library cards.

5381
05:10:46,120 --> 05:10:46,420
Really?

5382
05:10:47,500 --> 05:10:48,800
Sounds like George, all right.

5383
05:10:48,940 --> 05:10:49,620
She's cute.

5384
05:10:50,480 --> 05:10:54,080
She looks like the other, the robot in the, in the Baron.

5385
05:10:55,840 --> 05:10:57,420
Sorry you caught her on a bad day.

5386
05:10:58,160 --> 05:10:59,760
Aw, wait, I know.

5387
05:11:00,180 --> 05:11:01,840
I could just give you my library card.

5388
05:11:02,480 --> 05:11:05,080
Won't be hard for me to get another one.

5389
05:11:06,620 --> 05:11:07,340
Wow, thanks.

5390
05:11:09,140 --> 05:11:10,520
There, you're all set, I think.

5391
05:11:11,600 --> 05:11:12,360
Wait, shoot.

5392
05:11:12,880 --> 05:11:15,440
I forgot the front desk library bots have facial
recognition.

5393
05:11:16,040 --> 05:11:17,800
Oh, and my photo on the card won't match you.

5394
05:11:18,360 --> 05:11:20,340
Unless I tape a photo of my face to your face.

5395
05:11:21,880 --> 05:11:23,100
Um, that was a joke.

5396
05:11:24,080 --> 05:11:26,460
Maybe you'll get lucky and the robot will take it anyway.

5397
05:11:27,380 --> 05:11:29,520
Worst comes the worst, you can always find somewhere to take
a photo.

5398
05:11:30,780 --> 05:11:31,240
What's this?

5399
05:11:32,260 --> 05:11:33,720
Something is poking out from the shelf.

5400
05:11:34,060 --> 05:11:35,680
It's a tube of glitter glue.

5401
05:11:36,400 --> 05:11:37,580
You can have that if you want.

5402
05:11:37,900 --> 05:11:39,820
Never know when you need to glitter things up, right?

5403
05:11:42,420 --> 05:11:43,460
Are you sure?

5404
05:11:44,000 --> 05:11:45,000
Yeah, I have tons of those.

5405
05:11:45,440 --> 05:11:46,340
Thank you.

5406
05:11:47,860 --> 05:11:48,260
Glitter.

5407
05:11:51,340 --> 05:11:51,740
Oh.

5408
05:11:54,360 --> 05:11:57,320
So, you've been walking all over the world, huh?

5409
05:11:57,460 --> 05:11:57,860
Mm-hmm.

5410
05:11:58,420 --> 05:11:59,740
Jeez, I can't imagine.

5411
05:12:01,500 --> 05:12:02,340
Get your photo printed?

5412
05:12:02,800 --> 05:12:03,880
Bogo is binted?

5413
05:12:08,970 --> 05:12:10,190
Where do you get your photos printed?

5414
05:12:10,830 --> 05:12:11,890
Bogo is binted?

5415
05:12:25,600 --> 05:12:27,700
Do you get really tired sometimes?

5416
05:12:28,500 --> 05:12:28,740
Kinda.

5417
05:12:30,200 --> 05:12:30,800
But I don't mind.

5418
05:12:31,020 --> 05:12:32,260
It's actually really pretty.

5419
05:12:38,540 --> 05:12:39,500
But that's it.

5420
05:12:40,560 --> 05:12:42,340
Yes, that's exactly what I saw!

5421
05:12:44,680 --> 05:12:46,060
I'm glad you think so.

5422
05:12:46,960 --> 05:12:49,140
Even with the sun gone, the world is still a beautiful
place.

5423
05:12:50,200 --> 05:12:51,700
What did the world look like with the sun?

5424
05:12:52,540 --> 05:12:52,780
Oh.

5425
05:12:54,160 --> 05:12:58,120
You know, it's kind of embarrassing to admit how little of
it I have actually seen.

5426
05:12:58,900 --> 05:12:59,100
Oh?

5427
05:12:59,540 --> 05:13:00,400
Ironic, isn't it?

5428
05:13:00,660 --> 05:13:01,860
I'm sending you into orbit.

5429
05:13:03,500 --> 05:13:03,940
Why?

5430
05:13:07,820 --> 05:13:08,260
Why?

5431
05:13:08,260 --> 05:13:08,280
Why?

5432
05:13:11,900 --> 05:13:14,280
Even though I'm the world's leading researcher.

5433
05:13:15,100 --> 05:13:15,780
All I can do here...

5434
05:13:15,780 --> 05:13:16,660
Wait, this is Kibb.

5435
05:13:16,740 --> 05:13:17,800
That's what her thing said, right?

5436
05:13:18,260 --> 05:13:21,300
All I can do here is stay here and build robots.

5437
05:13:22,960 --> 05:13:24,420
You'll find out.

5438
05:13:26,120 --> 05:13:27,380
What did I do?

5439
05:13:29,320 --> 05:13:30,760
You're the ones exploring the world.

5440
05:13:30,880 --> 05:13:31,800
I just write down the data.

5441
05:13:32,080 --> 05:13:32,420
Crunch numbers.

5442
05:13:32,560 --> 05:13:33,620
Generate graphs.

5443
05:13:34,420 --> 05:13:36,060
Look at this graph.

5444
05:13:37,940 --> 05:13:39,500
I've been seeing robots everywhere.

5445
05:13:39,520 --> 05:13:43,640
I just thought it was because the world was too dangerous
for most people to explore.

5446
05:13:44,760 --> 05:13:46,160
That's not far from the truth, actually.

5447
05:13:47,100 --> 05:13:49,560
I know someone who still does his research firsthand.

5448
05:13:50,260 --> 05:13:50,860
The author.

5449
05:13:52,280 --> 05:13:56,580
Even after segments of land started collapsing and access to
the more remote areas became difficult.

5450
05:13:57,480 --> 05:14:00,860
I mean, he outright built a machine that could fly.

5451
05:14:02,280 --> 05:14:04,360
Something we all thought was not physically possible.

5452
05:14:05,220 --> 05:14:06,100
Oh, that's...

5453
05:14:06,100 --> 05:14:09,500
I asked him about working with us, so he provides us with
all sorts of insights.

5454
05:14:09,520 --> 05:14:10,480
from time to time.

5455
05:14:11,360 --> 05:14:14,300
For some reason, he really didn't want to build robots.

5456
05:14:18,910 --> 05:14:19,550
Do you have her necklace?

5457
05:14:19,590 --> 05:14:21,150
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, because it's Kip.

5458
05:14:22,270 --> 05:14:24,270
We're more specifically coding them.

5459
05:14:24,790 --> 05:14:25,250
How come?

5460
05:14:25,790 --> 05:14:26,290
It's me.

5461
05:14:27,710 --> 05:14:29,410
I mean, he's happy to work with robots.

5462
05:14:29,970 --> 05:14:31,490
In fact, he even...

5463
05:14:31,490 --> 05:14:33,390
It's been a while since we last talked.

5464
05:14:33,930 --> 05:14:35,670
He must be busy with his books now, yeah?

5465
05:14:42,700 --> 05:14:43,100
That's...

5466
05:14:43,100 --> 05:14:44,440
How did you get this?

5467
05:14:45,100 --> 05:14:46,360
This robot lady in the barren...

5468
05:14:46,380 --> 05:14:47,460
gave it to me.

5469
05:14:48,420 --> 05:14:50,360
She looked kind of like you.

5470
05:14:51,560 --> 05:14:51,960
I see.

5471
05:14:53,020 --> 05:14:54,720
He didn't want to spread his code.

5472
05:14:55,580 --> 05:14:56,540
Spread my code.

5473
05:15:00,700 --> 05:15:01,660
Sad music.

5474
05:15:03,420 --> 05:15:05,220
It was supposed to be such a breakthrough, you know?

5475
05:15:06,060 --> 05:15:09,040
I even based her on myself, so I'll know it works.

5476
05:15:10,340 --> 05:15:10,820
Breakthrough?

5477
05:15:11,940 --> 05:15:13,100
We're breaking free!

5478
05:15:14,460 --> 05:15:16,920
We wanted to build a robot that acts like Like a person.

5479
05:15:17,260 --> 05:15:18,100
Thinks like a person.

5480
05:15:18,620 --> 05:15:20,820
A robot that isn't bound by its own code.

5481
05:15:21,840 --> 05:15:21,960
Oh!

5482
05:15:24,860 --> 05:15:27,420
But turns out you can't really build something like that.

5483
05:15:28,080 --> 05:15:29,820
Too many contradictions in their code.

5484
05:15:30,360 --> 05:15:31,380
Made her unstable.

5485
05:15:33,560 --> 05:15:36,240
I was the only time I've ever seen a robot go rogue.

5486
05:15:38,580 --> 05:15:40,540
Scariest day of my life, tell you what?

5487
05:15:41,560 --> 05:15:41,900
Rogue.

5488
05:15:42,920 --> 05:15:44,760
You know, Nico kind of talks like Snake.

5489
05:15:47,180 --> 05:15:49,620
Where are they repeat the same thing?

5490
05:15:50,120 --> 05:15:51,580
As the person that said it?

5491
05:15:54,820 --> 05:15:56,720
We spreading code in here again?

5492
05:15:56,860 --> 05:15:57,360
Oh, yeah.

5493
05:15:58,720 --> 05:16:00,420
But she seemed so nice when we talked.

5494
05:16:01,360 --> 05:16:02,780
Even if she talked a little weird.

5495
05:16:04,120 --> 05:16:06,060
She's been repaired for some time now.

5496
05:16:07,180 --> 05:16:09,220
It is an effective conversational technique.

5497
05:16:13,620 --> 05:16:14,800
Repeating what they say?

5498
05:16:14,900 --> 05:16:15,240
Mm-hmm.

5499
05:16:17,700 --> 05:16:22,000
My friend was able to stabilize her volatile state through
his own means.

5500
05:16:22,740 --> 05:16:24,540
A real miracle worker thought.

5501
05:16:25,700 --> 05:16:28,820
After he was through, she ended up turning out just like how
I wanted.

5502
05:16:29,700 --> 05:16:31,140
But the damage was already done.

5503
05:16:32,780 --> 05:16:34,840
I gave up on her back then.

5504
05:16:35,280 --> 05:16:36,800
Oh, we all did.

5505
05:16:37,580 --> 05:16:39,060
I'm sure she realized that.

5506
05:16:39,840 --> 05:16:41,220
Now she won't ever come back.

5507
05:16:42,280 --> 05:16:43,960
She won't even answer my letters.

5508
05:16:46,380 --> 05:16:46,660
Sorry.

5509
05:16:47,800 --> 05:16:49,000
Sorry for rambling.

5510
05:16:49,740 --> 05:16:51,160
You should hold on to that, Amber, okay?

5511
05:16:51,740 --> 05:16:52,220
I will!

5512
05:16:57,380 --> 05:16:58,400
What about the strange journal?

5513
05:16:58,540 --> 05:16:59,840
I wonder if she knows this.

5514
05:17:02,720 --> 05:17:04,020
Don't overwork yourself, okay?

5515
05:17:04,680 --> 05:17:06,720
Your journey is just as important as your end goal.

5516
05:17:07,340 --> 05:17:08,300
Cliché, but true.

5517
05:17:10,420 --> 05:17:11,400
She did not know.

5518
05:17:14,720 --> 05:17:16,940
Let's just ignore that guy.

5519
05:17:17,520 --> 05:17:19,960
So sorry, so sorry for your troubles.

5520
05:17:26,800 --> 05:17:29,080
No, that is not Nico one-shot.

5521
05:17:31,420 --> 05:17:32,960
Where did I come from?

5522
05:17:34,340 --> 05:17:34,720
Here.

5523
05:17:37,500 --> 05:17:39,040
We did not go this way, I think.

5524
05:17:41,800 --> 05:17:42,200
Oh, wait.

5525
05:17:43,340 --> 05:17:44,380
No, we did not.

5526
05:17:45,360 --> 05:17:47,100
This area is huge.

5527
05:18:01,460 --> 05:18:02,640
It's like blinking a little.

5528
05:18:07,060 --> 05:18:08,020
Pretty music.

5529
05:18:12,620 --> 05:18:13,080
Remember the water.

5530
05:18:13,240 --> 05:18:14,120
I have not forgotten.

5531
05:18:15,080 --> 05:18:15,880
Don't you fret.

5532
05:18:28,860 --> 05:18:30,340
This little ear is wiggling.

5533
05:18:30,860 --> 05:18:31,900
Looks like I can unlock this door.

5534
05:18:32,140 --> 05:18:33,460
Oh, is it a shortcut now?

5535
05:18:34,600 --> 05:18:35,620
Ha, dag!

5536
05:18:36,180 --> 05:18:36,720
Let's go.

5537
05:18:40,460 --> 05:18:43,720
I just need to find the elevator.

5538
05:18:44,880 --> 05:18:48,690
I don't know where you're gonna...

5539
05:18:48,690 --> 05:18:49,470
Is it this?

5540
05:18:49,910 --> 05:18:51,330
No, this is the alleyway.

5541
05:18:57,540 --> 05:18:58,500
Oh, here it is.

5542
05:18:58,640 --> 05:19:08,700
I forgot that we can also fast travel.

5543
05:19:09,200 --> 05:19:09,740
Holy cow.

5544
05:19:11,260 --> 05:19:14,640
I feel like I've explored most everything, so...

5545
05:19:30,320 --> 05:19:32,780
I don't know if I would have been able to fast travel here,
though.

5546
05:19:34,580 --> 05:19:35,060
It's fine.

5547
05:19:35,160 --> 05:19:36,360
We can check once we're up here.

5548
05:19:37,460 --> 05:19:38,820
Yeah, I've been exploring.

5549
05:19:39,800 --> 05:19:40,920
I've been going around.

5550
05:19:41,640 --> 05:19:42,040
Yeah.

5551
05:19:42,200 --> 05:19:45,020
Checking out everything, all the things.

5552
05:19:45,940 --> 05:19:47,620
Call me Magellan.

5553
05:19:48,580 --> 05:19:49,420
Mint Jellin.

5554
05:19:52,340 --> 05:19:53,920
Medicated water.

5555
05:19:56,220 --> 05:19:57,360
Good thinking, Admin.

5556
05:19:58,900 --> 05:20:01,580
This water should really help the seed grow.

5557
05:20:05,020 --> 05:20:06,360
It sprouted a tiny leaf.

5558
05:20:08,800 --> 05:20:10,120
Good luck, little plant.

5559
05:20:16,360 --> 05:20:19,120
I have the sudden impression that I completely forgot
fast-traveling.

5560
05:20:20,980 --> 05:20:22,960
Oh my gosh, we really can!

5561
05:20:23,280 --> 05:20:23,500
Wait.

5562
05:20:25,020 --> 05:20:25,400
No.

5563
05:20:25,960 --> 05:20:27,260
Uh, no, you cannot.

5564
05:20:27,500 --> 05:20:29,380
Only, okay, so...

5565
05:20:29,380 --> 05:20:31,120
It's only upstairs and downstairs.

5566
05:20:33,260 --> 05:20:33,840
I got a...

5567
05:20:33,840 --> 05:20:34,700
I have a confession.

5568
05:20:34,980 --> 05:20:36,380
I got a friend into Uma Musume.

5569
05:20:36,760 --> 05:20:37,620
How should I repent?

5570
05:20:38,300 --> 05:20:39,400
Earth-bound ghost.

5571
05:20:39,880 --> 05:20:41,240
Oh, earth-bound ghost.

5572
05:20:42,060 --> 05:20:43,400
Why would you need to repent?

5573
05:20:44,200 --> 05:20:45,840
Why would you need to repent?

5574
05:20:46,660 --> 05:20:47,620
Spread Uma!

5575
05:20:48,380 --> 05:20:49,560
Spread my Uma!

5576
05:20:50,040 --> 05:20:51,780
Across the globe!

5577
05:20:56,080 --> 05:20:57,040
Alright, now...

5578
05:20:57,040 --> 05:20:59,760
We have a library card, so let's travel to the library.

5579
05:21:07,150 --> 05:21:07,630
What do you mean?

5580
05:21:11,080 --> 05:21:12,280
I know why... Okay.

5581
05:21:17,780 --> 05:21:18,760
Do I show it here?

5582
05:21:22,050 --> 05:21:23,390
Oh no, the facial recognition!

5583
05:21:23,890 --> 05:21:24,610
What a match failed.

5584
05:21:25,210 --> 05:21:27,010
It seems you do not resemble the owner of the card.

5585
05:21:28,510 --> 05:21:29,130
Bummer.

5586
05:21:29,410 --> 05:21:31,770
Okay, oh, we gotta find a place to take our photo.

5587
05:21:38,320 --> 05:21:38,940
Um...

5588
05:21:38,940 --> 05:21:39,840
Who's your favorite Uma?

5589
05:21:40,380 --> 05:21:41,520
Mejiro McQueen!

5590
05:21:42,380 --> 05:21:43,900
I love Mejiro McQueen.

5591
05:21:44,360 --> 05:21:44,780
Hi Minto!

5592
05:21:45,120 --> 05:21:46,080
Hi Ray Ban!

5593
05:21:46,220 --> 05:21:47,620
Thank you for six months!

5594
05:21:48,020 --> 05:21:48,780
Thank you!

5595
05:21:57,660 --> 05:21:59,180
The lens puzzle.

5596
05:22:00,440 --> 05:22:00,740
Oh!

5597
05:22:02,920 --> 05:22:03,540
Um...

5598
05:22:03,540 --> 05:22:04,200
That's right.

5599
05:22:04,880 --> 05:22:06,100
I can only do it outside.

5600
05:22:09,470 --> 05:22:10,890
I should really get back into the room.

5601
05:22:10,910 --> 05:22:14,830
to Uma, but I'm so bad about playing more than one gotcha
game at a time.

5602
05:22:16,970 --> 05:22:18,110
It was in Vendor Street, alright?

5603
05:22:20,430 --> 05:22:20,970
Yes.

5604
05:22:26,720 --> 05:22:28,580
This feels like, uh...

5605
05:22:31,700 --> 05:22:33,680
This feels like...

5606
05:22:36,680 --> 05:22:37,220
Zoombinis.

5607
05:22:38,320 --> 05:22:39,620
Don't ask me why.

5608
05:22:41,200 --> 05:22:42,780
There's like that one puzzle.

5609
05:22:50,960 --> 05:22:53,040
Is there a hint for this one or...

5610
05:22:59,800 --> 05:23:02,920
If you do try out Agnes Digital, you'll love her career.

5611
05:23:03,040 --> 05:23:05,240
Oh yeah, I've heard a lot of people saying that.

5612
05:23:05,640 --> 05:23:06,520
Ask the guy outside.

5613
05:23:06,680 --> 05:23:07,360
Oh, thank you.

5614
05:23:09,120 --> 05:23:10,220
Are you here for your photos?

5615
05:23:10,620 --> 05:23:11,200
Actually, yeah.

5616
05:23:11,560 --> 05:23:15,040
I need to take a picture for reasons.

5617
05:23:15,940 --> 05:23:17,620
I don't sound suspicious at all, you guys.

5618
05:23:18,380 --> 05:23:19,680
I don't sound suspicious at all.

5619
05:23:20,120 --> 05:23:21,440
I've got good news and bad news.

5620
05:23:21,780 --> 05:23:23,800
The good news is that the photo center is right behind me.

5621
05:23:24,060 --> 05:23:26,240
The bad news is that it doesn't work, right?

5622
05:23:27,300 --> 05:23:28,640
You're catching on quick.

5623
05:23:30,040 --> 05:23:32,900
After operations ended in the barons, this place got shut
down.

5624
05:23:33,540 --> 05:23:35,900
All the engineers lost their jobs and became street vendors.

5625
05:23:37,040 --> 05:23:38,940
Maybe Adminto and I can figure it out from them.

5626
05:23:39,620 --> 05:23:40,060
That's good.

5627
05:23:40,620 --> 05:23:42,880
It would certainly help out people with expired IDs.

5628
05:23:43,540 --> 05:23:43,920
Like me.

5629
05:23:47,440 --> 05:23:49,260
He used to be one of the camera engineers, right?

5630
05:23:49,260 --> 05:23:50,700
Oh, we immediately run up to somebody.

5631
05:23:52,280 --> 05:23:52,760
A camera?

5632
05:23:53,040 --> 05:23:54,200
Oh, joyous memories.

5633
05:23:55,580 --> 05:23:56,020
together.

5634
05:23:56,800 --> 05:23:58,720
And by that, I mean the concave lens did.

5635
05:24:03,990 --> 05:24:05,250
Can you tell me how to fix the camera?

5636
05:24:05,790 --> 05:24:06,490
It's been a while.

5637
05:24:06,750 --> 05:24:10,090
Pretty sure that bulgy lens goes on one of the ends, but I
forgot which.

5638
05:24:10,630 --> 05:24:11,850
The bulgy lens?

5639
05:24:12,070 --> 05:24:12,850
The thick one?

5640
05:24:15,390 --> 05:24:16,110
This one?

5641
05:24:21,970 --> 05:24:22,850
Thick lens?

5642
05:24:23,050 --> 05:24:23,930
Or do they mean...

5643
05:24:25,810 --> 05:24:28,430
The... Not the con... Not the concave one?

5644
05:24:28,950 --> 05:24:29,710
Or the con...

5645
05:24:33,360 --> 05:24:34,720
Bulgy equals convex.

5646
05:24:47,480 --> 05:24:49,160
Is there anything you remember about how to work the camera?

5647
05:24:50,180 --> 05:24:55,000
When arranging the lenses, make sure that the thin one is
positioned between the two curved ones.

5648
05:24:58,680 --> 05:24:59,860
I don't get the camera working.

5649
05:25:00,700 --> 05:25:02,860
The thick lens should be positioned to the left of both...

5650
05:25:02,860 --> 05:25:03,120
Ah!

5651
05:25:03,500 --> 05:25:03,780
Okay.

5652
05:25:04,300 --> 05:25:04,640
Alright.

5653
05:25:04,780 --> 05:25:05,660
I think we got it then.

5654
05:25:05,720 --> 05:25:06,480
I think we got it.

5655
05:25:10,250 --> 05:25:12,050
So the thin one is in between.

5656
05:25:14,710 --> 05:25:15,110
Okay.

5657
05:25:15,130 --> 05:25:17,670
And then the thick one is to the left.

5658
05:25:19,730 --> 05:25:20,350
First try.

5659
05:25:21,030 --> 05:25:21,310
Easy.

5660
05:25:23,590 --> 05:25:26,790
Representing for Simboli Rudolph.

5661
05:25:27,370 --> 05:25:29,010
She amazing puns.

5662
05:25:31,650 --> 05:25:32,330
Tease.

5663
05:25:35,330 --> 05:25:36,010
Out.

5664
05:25:36,250 --> 05:25:36,810
My eyes.

5665
05:25:39,170 --> 05:25:39,470
Yay!

5666
05:25:42,520 --> 05:25:44,560
It's a photo of me and my...

5667
05:25:44,560 --> 05:25:46,140
Are my eyes always this big?

5668
05:25:46,880 --> 05:26:00,760
see it back of the photo is covered in glue and glitter
photo of nico sticky the card is my face on it now yippee

5669
05:26:03,480 --> 05:26:14,940

eyes are my eyes big my

5670
05:26:25,420 --> 05:26:34,200
eyes big if I open my eyes too much they dry.

5671
05:26:34,620 --> 05:26:35,020
Blink,

5672
05:26:52,910 --> 05:26:54,770

5674
05:26:58,350 --> 05:26:59,350
blip, wait, I'm not even blinking anymore.

5675
05:26:59,670 --> 05:27:00,610
I'm just making the noise.

5676
05:27:17,970 --> 05:27:20,110
Oh, wait, the big eyes you have.

5677
05:27:20,690 --> 05:27:21,390
Big eyes, poop.

5678
05:27:22,830 --> 05:27:24,430
Not big enough, please enhance.

5679
05:27:25,230 --> 05:27:26,410
Don't steal a kid!

5680
05:27:47,050 --> 05:27:48,870
Come on, I'm the prize.

5681
05:27:49,650 --> 05:27:50,710
I'm the prize.

5682
05:27:52,550 --> 05:27:53,650
Yeah, I'm the

5683
05:27:59,880 --> 05:28:01,440
Barcode, facial recognition.

5684
05:28:01,900 --> 05:28:02,800
Photo match successful.

5685
05:28:03,300 --> 05:28:04,000
You're good to go.

5686
05:28:04,380 --> 05:28:05,300
Have a nice day, Miss Kip.

5687
05:28:07,000 --> 05:28:09,740
Time to wipe the kiss marks off my monitor.

5688
05:28:14,060 --> 05:28:15,020
Stop it.

5689
05:28:17,540 --> 05:28:19,160
Maybe I should have changed the name.

5690
05:28:25,260 --> 05:28:26,780
I think she's in there.

5691
05:28:28,060 --> 05:28:28,920
It's full.

5692
05:28:30,580 --> 05:28:31,780
Looks like an old phone.

5693
05:28:31,920 --> 05:28:33,960
Wait, this is the phone we've been calling her on.

5694
05:28:34,440 --> 05:28:35,060
Small tree.

5695
05:28:38,340 --> 05:28:39,480
Another small tree.

5696
05:28:41,660 --> 05:28:42,500
Excuse me.

5697
05:28:43,080 --> 05:28:43,300
Hey!

5698
05:28:44,040 --> 05:28:46,800
Who the heck do you think you are barging in here like that?

5699
05:28:47,260 --> 05:28:48,540
I don't care if you're the Messiah.

5700
05:28:48,740 --> 05:28:49,880
Manners are still a thing!

5701
05:28:52,260 --> 05:28:53,180
I'm sorry.

5702
05:28:53,900 --> 05:28:56,100
Well, are you just here to apologize?

5703
05:28:57,460 --> 05:28:57,920
Yes!

5704
05:28:58,340 --> 05:28:58,520
No!

5705
05:28:58,760 --> 05:28:59,140
I mean, no!

5706
05:29:00,020 --> 05:29:01,020
I mean, I need your help.

5707
05:29:01,480 --> 05:29:03,120
I'm not sure what I need to do next.

5708
05:29:03,740 --> 05:29:05,140
I think I need to go into the tower?

5709
05:29:05,920 --> 05:29:06,380
Seriously?

5710
05:29:06,760 --> 05:29:07,980
You haven't figured that one out yet?

5711
05:29:08,460 --> 05:29:11,060
I think George kind of sucks.

5712
05:29:13,420 --> 05:29:16,920
I've met George for two seconds and I'm already...

5713
05:29:19,240 --> 05:29:23,480
George's personality is randomly chosen out of the six sides
every time you play the game.

5714
05:29:24,480 --> 05:29:25,640
No stinking way.

5715
05:29:30,520 --> 05:29:32,540
We got the bad orangey!

5716
05:29:33,100 --> 05:29:34,340
I don't know how to get in!

5717
05:29:35,000 --> 05:29:35,940
Well, I don't know either.

5718
05:29:39,830 --> 05:29:42,330
All I know is that nobody from this world can get in there.

5719
05:29:43,050 --> 05:29:44,950
Not beyond that tiny entrance room anyway.

5720
05:29:45,590 --> 05:29:48,750
If anything, there might be a book on how the Messiah of all
people can get in.

5721
05:29:49,470 --> 05:29:53,170
But I don't think... I don't got anything like that in my
collection.

5722
05:29:54,430 --> 05:29:55,550
We got the bad George.

5723
05:29:55,590 --> 05:29:56,890
We got the bitchy George.

5724
05:29:59,670 --> 05:30:00,850
Who the hell is George?

5725
05:30:01,030 --> 05:30:03,710
This dice, this dice right here.

5726
05:30:04,590 --> 05:30:05,810
Would like to though.

5727
05:30:06,070 --> 05:30:06,490
I see.

5728
05:30:06,910 --> 05:30:09,270
I feel like George is a pretty cute name for a girl.

5729
05:30:09,510 --> 05:30:10,530
Now I think about it.

5730
05:30:14,290 --> 05:30:16,630
I think that's a cute name for a girl.

5731
05:30:17,170 --> 05:30:17,470
George.

5732
05:30:17,670 --> 05:30:19,270
I feel like it's kind of like a George.

5733
05:30:21,170 --> 05:30:21,610
Georgia.

5734
05:30:21,610 --> 05:30:22,050
Georgina.

5735
05:30:22,650 --> 05:30:23,070
It's cute.

5736
05:30:23,930 --> 05:30:24,010
George.

5737
05:30:25,370 --> 05:30:26,550
I think it's cute.

5738
05:30:30,320 --> 05:30:32,820
The fridge is full of bottled water and takeout boxes.

5739
05:30:34,200 --> 05:30:38,100
Well, since you're already here, it'd be rude for me to tell
you to leave.

5740
05:30:38,760 --> 05:30:40,360
So you got any questions about books?

5741
05:30:41,840 --> 05:30:43,500
Or you can read something here, I don't care.

5742
05:30:44,040 --> 05:30:44,840
Just don't make a mess.

5743
05:30:48,340 --> 05:30:48,680
Printer.

5744
05:30:51,440 --> 05:30:51,800
Metal.

5745
05:30:52,660 --> 05:30:54,140
Oh, we got a lot of books here, okay.

5746
05:30:57,820 --> 05:30:58,820
Black Clover symbol.

5747
05:30:59,620 --> 05:31:01,560
And this other book has a black clover on its spine.

5748
05:31:02,020 --> 05:31:02,820
And the rest of these books too.

5749
05:31:02,840 --> 05:31:04,780
Oh, they're all about clovers?

5750
05:31:08,440 --> 05:31:09,160
George Phantom.

5751
05:31:12,620 --> 05:31:13,960
I've met a Georgie before.

5752
05:31:14,240 --> 05:31:15,000
Oh, that's cute.

5753
05:31:15,960 --> 05:31:16,080
What?

5754
05:31:16,180 --> 05:31:16,900
Of course not.

5755
05:31:17,020 --> 05:31:18,980
That's just how the author marks his work.

5756
05:31:19,540 --> 05:31:19,720
Oh.

5757
05:31:20,420 --> 05:31:24,340
Because he has to keep up with his mysterious persona, I
guess.

5758
05:31:26,080 --> 05:31:27,440
He's never even told me his name.

5759
05:31:28,120 --> 05:31:29,840
Wait, so if he wrote all of these books...

5760
05:31:32,840 --> 05:31:33,300
Yes, he did.

5761
05:31:35,300 --> 05:31:36,820
Why does she hate me, you guys?

5762
05:31:40,500 --> 05:31:40,980
Whoa!

5763
05:31:41,720 --> 05:31:45,100
This is about a profit bot.

5764
05:31:45,180 --> 05:31:49,880
Oh my god, he has like a little like a little robe and
stuff.

5765
05:31:51,460 --> 05:31:54,480
Dr. Silverpoint's team was able to replicate our prototype.

5766
05:31:55,560 --> 05:31:56,440
Oh, cute!

5767
05:31:57,580 --> 05:31:58,460
What about this one?

5768
05:31:59,960 --> 05:32:01,920
Hey, I think this book is actually about clovers.

5769
05:32:02,560 --> 05:32:09,620
Oh, the black clover although its pigmentation is primarily
black the leaves display incredible iridescence when exposed

5770
05:32:09,620 --> 05:32:18,900
to sunlight whoa these curious plants are most resilient can
even thrive in the metallic sand and harsh climate of the

5771
05:32:18,900 --> 05:32:28,860
barons oh my gosh matara con of plants it's a stinking
cockroach and the glen it can also grow directly on top of

5772
05:32:28,860 --> 05:32:31,300
the moss layer without competing with the moss for
resources.

5773
05:32:32,520 --> 05:32:37,400
Radiocarbon dating of fossils suggests that these plants may
be the first lifeforms to colonize our world.

5774
05:32:40,540 --> 05:32:41,260
Sketchbook.

5775
05:32:45,340 --> 05:32:46,060
Wednesday.

5776
05:32:46,060 --> 05:32:46,780
Another...

5777
05:32:46,780 --> 05:32:47,400
Stiff?

5778
05:32:48,580 --> 05:32:51,680
Stiff life of some objects on my desk.

5779
05:32:53,260 --> 05:32:53,900
Stiff...

5780
05:32:53,900 --> 05:32:54,440
What?

5781
05:32:54,680 --> 05:32:55,620
Stiff not...

5782
05:32:58,540 --> 05:33:02,200
Stiff not very Very good, but silver can recognize the
objects at least.

5783
05:33:02,920 --> 05:33:04,300
Thursday, various sketches practice.

5784
05:33:07,720 --> 05:33:08,760
Oh, still.

5785
05:33:11,040 --> 05:33:12,360
Another still light.

5786
05:33:12,540 --> 05:33:12,820
Oh.

5787
05:33:15,260 --> 05:33:17,640
I thought it was stiff because they weren't moving.

5788
05:33:24,480 --> 05:33:26,700
George one is kind of the opposite of George six.

5789
05:33:27,020 --> 05:33:28,500
Same with two and five, three and four.

5790
05:33:29,660 --> 05:33:41,820
the opposites also opposites on a six-sided dice cute the
stiff life it's a stiff life for me you gotta get your blood

5791
05:33:41,820 --> 05:33:51,420
pumping you gotta stand up get your you gotta move your
bones another fruitful visit to the great prophet today she

5792
05:33:51,420 --> 05:33:56,620
seemed a high in spirits she told me that she saw another
glimpse of the messiah's arrival more vivid than ever before

5793
05:33:56,620 --> 05:34:00,860
the messiah will in a dark house.

5794
05:34:01,360 --> 05:34:02,880
Oh, sorry.

5795
05:34:12,320 --> 05:34:13,920
A book on the ground.

5796
05:34:16,040 --> 05:34:18,140
She deeply believed in the multiverse theory.

5797
05:34:18,740 --> 05:34:21,760
Regarding alternate versions, she likened the probability to
rolling of dice.

5798
05:34:23,140 --> 05:34:28,460
Recently, I found the theory easier and easier to believe,
but I could not describe it very well back then.

5799
05:34:28,840 --> 05:34:31,400
Nevertheless, I still wrote it to the best of my abilities.

5800
05:34:31,920 --> 05:34:34,240
After all, it felt only right to honor her this way.

5801
05:34:34,740 --> 05:34:46,380
There are six which one did you encounter read the books in
the library i don't think this is a good time for a nap okay

5802
05:34:46,380 --> 05:35:01,200
i'm still confused though we meant two oh sorry i don't mean
to keep clicking what's this picture here i can't see it

5803
05:35:01,200 --> 05:35:07,980
never mind what about this one even the painting is books
books.

5804
05:35:10,100 --> 05:35:11,580
Wait, so I have to...

5805
05:35:13,180 --> 05:35:14,900
Wait, let me show the journal to her.

5806
05:35:15,180 --> 05:35:15,640
She probably...

5807
05:35:15,640 --> 05:35:16,880
This is what I wanted to do before.

5808
05:35:20,680 --> 05:35:21,580
I have this book.

5809
05:35:23,180 --> 05:35:26,400
I think it's written in some sort of words I don't
recognize.

5810
05:35:27,420 --> 05:35:28,040
Let me see.

5811
05:35:28,640 --> 05:35:29,440
Of course.

5812
05:35:29,960 --> 05:35:30,700
Of course!

5813
05:35:32,640 --> 05:35:33,840
More work for George.

5814
05:35:34,500 --> 05:35:34,500
Fine.

5815
05:35:35,260 --> 05:35:36,080
Hey, uh, kid?

5816
05:35:36,600 --> 05:35:36,980
Nico!

5817
05:35:37,580 --> 05:35:40,520
Looks like I'm gonna have to translate this for you Might
take a while.

5818
05:35:42,800 --> 05:35:43,160
Oh no.

5819
05:35:46,930 --> 05:35:50,010
Nico, don't you know not to say you aren't to me?

5820
05:35:54,370 --> 05:35:55,350
Excuse me.

5821
05:35:55,730 --> 05:35:56,690
I know that feel, kid.

5822
05:35:56,990 --> 05:35:58,690
I'm at a good night's sleeping weeks.

5823
05:36:00,090 --> 05:36:03,490
Wasn't sleepy two minutes ago.

5824
05:36:03,810 --> 05:36:04,210
But now.

5825
05:36:05,810 --> 05:36:06,610
That's not good.

5826
05:36:06,950 --> 05:36:07,590
You know what?

5827
05:36:07,610 --> 05:36:08,610
I have a guest room.

5828
05:36:08,730 --> 05:36:09,730
Okay, go take a nap.

5829
05:36:10,510 --> 05:36:13,170
Okay, don't say yours, please.

5830
05:36:16,690 --> 05:36:19,890
I should ban it for my... for my...

5831
05:36:22,370 --> 05:36:24,770
I'm a little tired from walking.

5832
05:36:25,490 --> 05:36:26,610
It's all right if I take a nap.

5833
05:36:27,250 --> 05:36:27,290
Yes.

5834
05:36:28,630 --> 05:36:29,490
Close the game.

5835
05:36:30,070 --> 05:36:31,390
Alright, alright.

5836
05:36:33,610 --> 05:36:34,330
Play!

5837
05:36:38,640 --> 05:36:40,940
Oh my gosh, Nico.

5838
05:36:41,940 --> 05:36:43,620
I ate all the pancakes.

5839
05:36:44,180 --> 05:36:48,380
What is that?

5840
05:36:49,900 --> 05:36:50,520
Uh-huh.

5841
05:36:55,470 --> 05:36:56,290
Broken light bulb.

5842
05:36:59,320 --> 05:37:00,960
What's that mean?

5843
05:37:03,400 --> 05:37:06,740
Hey, Adminto, I guess you saw my dream?

5844
05:37:07,540 --> 05:37:07,840
Yes.

5845
05:37:08,500 --> 05:37:09,780
It was...

5846
05:37:10,540 --> 05:37:11,160
Scary?

5847
05:37:12,120 --> 05:37:13,380
Are you okay?

5848
05:37:14,080 --> 05:37:15,420
Come on, let's go.

5849
05:37:19,110 --> 05:37:20,430
Spooky, scary dream.

5850
05:37:20,890 --> 05:37:21,450
Nightmare.

5851
05:37:26,770 --> 05:37:36,530
finally the translation is done oh that was faster than I
thought well yeah you've been asleep for hours oh anyway

5852
05:37:36,530 --> 05:37:50,700
looks like this journal was meant for Admin to me read it
yourself greetings Admin to this book was meant for Admin to

5853
05:37:50,700 --> 05:38:02,530
how could you tell if you can finally read this that means
you are near the tower The tower is the domain of the

5854
05:38:02,530 --> 05:38:03,750
elusive entity.

5855
05:38:04,150 --> 05:38:04,530
That's me?

5856
05:38:04,690 --> 05:38:05,390
I'm an entity!

5857
05:38:07,230 --> 05:38:08,990
This being is connected to the world.

5858
05:38:09,410 --> 05:38:12,170
For now, you can think of it as the spirit of the world.

5859
05:38:13,430 --> 05:38:17,050
It has no physical form, but it can communicate through
computers and other machinery.

5860
05:38:18,170 --> 05:38:19,890
You know who I am talking about, of course.

5861
05:38:21,250 --> 05:38:24,370
When you first arrived here with our Savior, it is no
doubt...

5862
05:38:24,370 --> 05:38:26,290
It no doubt contacted you right away.

5863
05:38:26,750 --> 05:38:27,050
Steam?

5864
05:38:29,250 --> 05:38:29,730
Steam?

5865
05:38:32,630 --> 05:38:33,350
Gabe's team?

5866
05:38:36,610 --> 05:38:40,230
Though its own means, the entity will guide the both of you
to the tower.

5867
05:38:41,070 --> 05:38:43,050
The entry room is at the tower's base.

5868
05:38:43,550 --> 05:38:47,130
Not only do you need the sun there, but also three pieces of
the previous sun.

5869
05:38:48,090 --> 05:38:50,130
The savior will not be able to do anything there.

5870
05:38:50,770 --> 05:38:52,430
You, Adminto, on the other hand.

5871
05:38:55,190 --> 05:38:56,730
Look at the pattern on the floor.

5872
05:38:57,230 --> 05:38:57,950
Do as it says.

5873
05:38:58,450 --> 05:39:00,590
The window will be gone, so you need to bring it back.

5874
05:39:01,550 --> 05:39:03,250
That's all there is.

5875
05:39:04,730 --> 05:39:05,870
Someone tore out the other pages.

5876
05:39:06,830 --> 05:39:07,670
Did you do this?

5877
05:39:08,050 --> 05:39:08,330
No.

5878
05:39:09,150 --> 05:39:10,130
And you're on your own, kid.

5879
05:39:10,590 --> 05:39:11,770
I'm not sure what window...

5880
05:39:12,330 --> 05:39:13,390
Window means here.

5881
05:39:14,370 --> 05:39:15,770
Probably like the window...

5882
05:39:17,150 --> 05:39:17,670
Like...

5883
05:39:17,670 --> 05:39:17,930
This...

5884
05:39:18,370 --> 05:39:19,070
This window.

5885
05:39:21,550 --> 05:39:22,070
But...

5886
05:39:27,420 --> 05:39:29,800
Maybe Anminto will have to figure that out.

5887
05:39:29,920 --> 05:39:30,780
That one.

5888
05:39:31,960 --> 05:39:32,280
Ray.

5889
05:39:32,860 --> 05:39:35,280
By the way, what does it mean by three pieces of the
pre-pages?

5890
05:39:35,300 --> 05:39:36,280
previous sun.

5891
05:39:36,820 --> 05:39:37,440
The winto?

5892
05:39:37,980 --> 05:39:38,420
Winto?

5893
05:39:38,840 --> 05:39:40,780
WW, flip it around.

5894
05:39:41,040 --> 05:39:41,560
Minto?

5895
05:39:44,460 --> 05:39:47,340
I only have this sun.

5896
05:39:48,020 --> 05:39:49,280
Do I have to explain everything?

5897
05:39:50,760 --> 05:39:53,960
It's just a fancy word for objects containing yellow
phosphor.

5898
05:39:54,520 --> 05:39:55,900
You know, stuff that glows yellow.

5899
05:39:56,520 --> 05:39:56,700
Oh.

5900
05:39:58,340 --> 05:40:00,320
I do have a piece of amber and a feather.

5901
05:40:01,340 --> 05:40:02,360
They fit the description, right?

5902
05:40:03,080 --> 05:40:08,200
Yeah, but you only have two of them, and they're super rare,
so it's not like you're gonna find something like that on

5903
05:40:08,200 --> 05:40:08,820
the ground.

5904
05:40:10,740 --> 05:40:11,200
Right.

5905
05:40:12,580 --> 05:40:13,040
Okay.

5906
05:40:13,580 --> 05:40:14,520
Here, you can have this.

5907
05:40:16,800 --> 05:40:17,120
No!

5908
05:40:19,600 --> 05:40:22,480
Nico, the character was actually created on December 28th.

5909
05:40:22,540 --> 05:40:23,280
It's their birthday.

5910
05:40:24,900 --> 05:40:25,320
What?

5911
05:40:26,440 --> 05:40:26,900
Wait.

5912
05:40:28,840 --> 05:40:29,300
Actually?

5913
05:40:33,460 --> 05:40:34,340
No way!

5914
05:40:37,100 --> 05:40:37,980
No way!

5915
05:40:42,540 --> 05:40:43,920
Happy birthday, Nico!

5916
05:40:45,340 --> 05:40:46,220
Happy birthday!

5917
05:40:49,720 --> 05:40:51,900
Oh, it looks kind of like you.

5918
05:40:52,720 --> 05:40:52,880
What?

5919
05:40:53,180 --> 05:40:54,220
I've never seen dice before?

5920
05:40:54,960 --> 05:40:55,160
No?

5921
05:40:55,600 --> 05:40:56,260
I mean, yes?

5922
05:40:56,880 --> 05:40:58,340
I mean, it's just... never mind.

5923
05:40:58,920 --> 05:40:59,440
So, yeah.

5924
05:40:59,960 --> 05:41:00,640
Need anything else?

5925
05:41:01,220 --> 05:41:02,060
I'm good, thank you.

5926
05:41:02,520 --> 05:41:03,220
Off you go, then.

5927
05:41:03,520 --> 05:41:04,500
Don't screw this up, okay?

5928
05:41:09,640 --> 05:41:11,820
Nico is 12 years old in real life.

5929
05:41:16,220 --> 05:41:17,560
Happy birthday, Nico.

5930
05:41:19,380 --> 05:41:20,440
Wait, it's the pancakes?

5931
05:41:20,540 --> 05:41:21,080
Is that what?

5932
05:41:21,840 --> 05:41:22,880
We get the pancakes?

5933
05:41:23,340 --> 05:41:23,840
To Nico.

5934
05:41:26,840 --> 05:41:27,260
Oh.

5935
05:41:27,660 --> 05:41:28,880
Oh my god, I thought that was me.

5936
05:41:29,280 --> 05:41:31,740
Hey, Admin, do you remember where the cafe is?

5937
05:41:32,300 --> 05:41:32,580
Yes.

5938
05:41:33,040 --> 05:41:33,500
Oh, good.

5939
05:41:33,800 --> 05:41:35,240
I'm asking because, well...

5940
05:41:35,240 --> 05:41:36,000
Oh, hungry.

5941
05:41:36,880 --> 05:41:38,380
Actually, I'm really hungry.

5942
05:41:38,720 --> 05:41:40,840
I haven't eaten anything since I got here.

5943
05:41:43,920 --> 05:41:46,060
Let's go get some food before we enter the tower.

5944
05:41:46,900 --> 05:41:48,000
I hope they have pancakes.

5945
05:41:49,000 --> 05:41:49,360
Alright.

5946
05:41:52,940 --> 05:41:55,320
That was so well timed.

5947
05:41:55,480 --> 05:41:56,400
Oh my gosh.

5948
05:41:57,240 --> 05:41:58,600
I'm also hungry though.

5949
05:42:01,280 --> 05:42:03,720
I do have some food I can eat.

5950
05:42:05,300 --> 05:42:07,180
But I was gonna wait until after stream.

5951
05:42:07,340 --> 05:42:09,380
But I think I have still quite a bit to go, no?

5952
05:42:13,220 --> 05:42:13,720
Mm-hmm.

5953
05:42:18,680 --> 05:42:20,160
Take a break, it's okay.

5954
05:42:32,580 --> 05:42:33,280
Oh, hey, you're back.

5955
05:42:37,150 --> 05:42:39,090
You're close to the end of the first part.

5956
05:42:40,310 --> 05:42:41,590
Wait, first part.

5957
05:42:46,090 --> 05:42:47,950
Did you manage to fix the elevator?

5958
05:42:48,970 --> 05:42:49,330
Mm-hmm.

5959
05:42:49,910 --> 05:42:51,550
And Minto and I went to the surface already.

5960
05:42:53,670 --> 05:42:54,110
And...

5961
05:42:56,730 --> 05:43:00,010
Well, I remembered there being a cafe here.

5962
05:43:00,310 --> 05:43:01,090
Do you have pancakes?

5963
05:43:01,450 --> 05:43:02,270
We sure do.

5964
05:43:02,950 --> 05:43:03,990
Wait, I don't have any money.

5965
05:43:04,510 --> 05:43:06,370
Maybe I can help you wash dishes or something.

5966
05:43:07,030 --> 05:43:08,170
It's on the house.

5967
05:43:08,970 --> 05:43:10,710
At least I can do for the Savior, right?

5968
05:43:11,410 --> 05:43:12,510
Here, why don't you take a seat?

5969
05:43:12,910 --> 05:43:14,330
I'll go fry some up for you.

5970
05:43:15,150 --> 05:43:15,570
Pancakes.

5971
05:43:15,930 --> 05:43:17,330
These eyes are so cute.

5972
05:43:21,340 --> 05:43:23,460
These pancakes are so good.

5973
05:43:24,180 --> 05:43:25,220
Thank you so much.

5974
05:43:25,940 --> 05:43:26,660
No problem.

5975
05:43:27,120 --> 05:43:28,180
You looked really hungry.

5976
05:43:28,940 --> 05:43:31,860
Yeah, I thought this would be my last chance to eat
something before I go in the tower.

5977
05:43:32,680 --> 05:43:33,040
Gotcha.

5978
05:43:35,180 --> 05:43:37,500
So I guess pancakes are your favorite food?

5979
05:43:37,880 --> 05:43:38,260
Mm-hmm.

5980
05:43:38,980 --> 05:43:39,840
Well, almost.

5981
05:43:40,880 --> 05:43:42,120
The stomach growls are too realistic.

5982
05:43:42,260 --> 05:43:42,500
I know!

5983
05:43:42,820 --> 05:43:43,940
You guys, I'm gonna go grab my food.

5984
05:43:44,060 --> 05:43:44,740
I'll be right back.

5985
05:44:49,300 --> 05:44:51,640
Thank you for all the super times!

5986
05:44:56,060 --> 05:44:56,520
Yummy.

5987
05:44:57,260 --> 05:44:57,260
Okay.

5988
05:44:58,320 --> 05:44:59,240
Sandwich time.

5989
05:45:15,820 --> 05:45:16,280
Um...

5990
05:45:16,280 --> 05:45:17,720
I forgot a napkin.

5991
05:45:24,210 --> 05:45:25,550
Mmm, I like the music.

5992
05:45:31,110 --> 05:45:32,510
Mungo mungo mungo suge!

5993
05:45:35,270 --> 05:45:35,990
Oishi!

5994
05:45:40,840 --> 05:45:42,260
YouTube censors hot mom.

5995
05:45:42,460 --> 05:45:45,460
So I've come here to finally say all these pancakes are
missing.

5996
05:45:46,680 --> 05:45:48,000
Are Nico's hot mom.

5997
05:45:53,600 --> 05:45:55,480
So you want Nico's mom.

5998
05:45:56,280 --> 05:45:59,960
Nico's mom is got it going on.

5999
05:46:03,060 --> 05:46:04,040
Okay, okay.

6000
05:46:05,740 --> 05:46:06,740
Wait, continue.

6001
05:46:10,730 --> 05:46:14,330
My favorite food in the world are the special pancakes that
my mama makes.

6002
05:46:19,270 --> 05:46:22,010
She likes to pick hazelnuts and grind them up in the batter?

6003
05:46:22,550 --> 05:46:23,830
Wait, that sounds amazing.

6004
05:46:25,070 --> 05:46:26,390
Yeah, that's what I just said.

6005
05:46:30,290 --> 05:46:30,730
Mugugug.

6006
05:46:34,490 --> 05:46:35,990
They taste amazing.

6007
05:46:36,550 --> 05:46:38,910
She always made them when I was feeling sad.

6008
05:46:39,470 --> 05:46:40,290
We're lonely.

6009
05:46:42,070 --> 05:46:42,510
Or...

6010
05:46:47,520 --> 05:46:47,940
Oh, cry.

6011
05:46:48,300 --> 05:46:49,480
I also miss Ayami, mama.

6012
05:46:50,060 --> 05:46:51,800
Oh, it came through.

6013
05:46:52,180 --> 05:46:53,360
Thank you for the dodo.

6014
05:46:54,700 --> 05:46:57,800
There's an anniversary game that shows the recipe for his
mom's pancakes.

6015
05:46:58,860 --> 05:47:00,160
I want to try it.

6016
05:47:00,260 --> 05:47:01,060
I want to try it.

6017
05:47:01,140 --> 05:47:02,360
Maybe we could do that on stream.

6018
05:47:02,620 --> 05:47:03,600
Or I make the pancakes.

6019
05:47:04,860 --> 05:47:06,560
But right now, my setup...

6020
05:47:07,780 --> 05:47:11,540
My current maid cafe is not very good for, like, home
cooking streams or...

6021
05:47:11,560 --> 05:47:19,760
anything like that so maybe in the future whenever I move we
could do it afterwards

6022
05:47:35,830 --> 05:47:44,170
I just I just have a bad feeling all of a sudden am I even
here to save the world people have been saying how the sun

6023
05:47:44,170 --> 05:47:47,250
won't fix anything I don't even know why I'm here

6024
05:47:50,310 --> 05:47:52,690
I just want to see my mama again

6025
05:47:56,970 --> 05:47:57,690
They're there!

6026
05:47:58,390 --> 05:47:59,310
It's gonna be okay!

6027
05:48:00,310 --> 05:48:02,030
And I'm sure you'll be able to save the world.

6028
05:48:02,770 --> 05:48:03,430
You're a tough kid.

6029
05:48:03,830 --> 05:48:05,470
You managed to get this far already, right?

6030
05:48:08,190 --> 05:48:08,990
Yeah, but...

6031
05:48:08,990 --> 05:48:10,750
And they'll get to go home afterwards, right?

6032
05:48:12,010 --> 05:48:12,410
Right!

6033
05:48:14,110 --> 05:48:14,930
Yeah, Nico.

6034
05:48:15,590 --> 05:48:16,570
This is a Denny's.

6035
05:48:18,930 --> 05:48:19,730
Poor guy.

6036
05:48:21,270 --> 05:48:22,630
Hey, I want some more pancakes.

6037
05:48:23,370 --> 05:48:23,950
It's okay.

6038
05:48:24,310 --> 05:48:25,070
You are suck.

6039
05:48:25,230 --> 05:48:25,870
No, I'm just kidding.

6040
05:48:27,270 --> 05:48:40,370

are the savior of the world and has not complained about it

pancakes No problem Good luck Pancakes favorite food I don't

6044
05:49:17,470 --> 05:49:19,450

6045
05:49:28,840 --> 05:49:30,080
Poor little guy

6046
05:49:38,540 --> 05:49:41,680
I don't think I saw the Entrance of the tower did I?

6047
05:49:46,700 --> 05:49:48,880
That's why I meant I don't know where to go.

6048
05:49:56,160 --> 05:49:59,000
I don't know if I ever ran into it.

6049
05:50:08,090 --> 05:50:08,210
Thanks!

6050
05:50:08,550 --> 05:50:09,370
Oh, where was that?

6051
05:50:09,710 --> 05:50:12,690
It was

6052
05:50:17,130 --> 05:50:17,550
like...

6053
05:50:19,270 --> 05:50:20,150
Was it a near?

6054
05:50:21,890 --> 05:50:22,450
No.

6055
05:50:24,190 --> 05:50:26,190
But we like went somewhere.

6056
05:50:37,040 --> 05:50:38,840
This area confuses me.

6057
05:50:40,660 --> 05:50:42,200
Looks very similar, everything.

6058
05:50:43,080 --> 05:50:43,880
The shortcut.

6059
05:50:44,440 --> 05:50:44,980
Ah!

6060
05:50:45,680 --> 05:50:46,040
Was it?

6061
05:50:46,100 --> 05:50:47,540
It was in the shortcut, was it?

6062
05:50:51,140 --> 05:50:52,100
Right here.

6063
05:50:52,840 --> 05:50:53,720
This is the shortcut.

6064
05:50:56,400 --> 05:50:56,640
Yes!

6065
05:50:57,020 --> 05:50:57,960
Thank you guys.

6066
05:51:03,280 --> 05:51:03,820
Yes.

6067
05:51:05,400 --> 05:51:05,940
Yes.

6068
05:51:06,720 --> 05:51:06,980
Yes.

6069
05:51:07,260 --> 05:51:07,340
Yes.

6070
05:51:07,340 --> 05:51:07,380
Yes.

6071
05:51:07,740 --> 05:51:08,280
Yes.

6072
05:51:10,260 --> 05:51:10,800
Yes.

6073
05:51:19,820 --> 05:51:21,660
So what did I need to do with the window?

6074
05:51:21,660 --> 05:51:25,120
I might

6075
05:51:38,490 --> 05:51:40,110
have made a mistake there, but

6076
05:52:00,160 --> 05:52:02,320
It's scary to do it, though

6077
05:52:06,850 --> 05:52:08,630
Is this the inside of the tower?

6078
05:52:09,630 --> 05:52:14,030
It's a lot darker than I thought Wait Where's the sun?

6079
05:52:17,310 --> 05:52:18,670
Adminto, do you know what happened to the sun?

6080
05:52:22,350 --> 05:52:22,750
Adminto?

6081
05:52:23,970 --> 05:52:25,630
Wait, Nico, can't hear me?

6082
05:52:26,310 --> 05:52:26,750
Admital!

6083
05:52:27,610 --> 05:52:28,050
Niko!

6084
05:52:29,430 --> 05:52:30,310
Say something!

6085
05:52:43,350 --> 05:52:45,490
Oh, we could still control him though.

6086
05:52:59,280 --> 05:53:00,300
We had no items.

6087
05:53:09,620 --> 05:53:12,360
Don't tell her what pressing the X did in the original
version of the game.

6088
05:53:12,500 --> 05:53:13,020
Oh gosh.

6089
05:53:15,060 --> 05:53:17,840
I want to know after I complete everything.

6090
05:53:21,320 --> 05:53:22,800
Am I going the wrong way?

6091
05:53:23,240 --> 05:53:23,920
Left or right?

6092
05:53:24,040 --> 05:53:25,020
Yeah, let's try a different...

6093
05:53:27,520 --> 05:53:28,080
Something?

6094
05:53:28,760 --> 05:53:28,760
Someone?

6095
05:53:28,920 --> 05:53:29,200
Somewhere?

6096
05:53:29,900 --> 05:53:30,060
Oh,

6097
05:53:48,810 --> 05:53:48,810
okay.

6098
05:53:48,810 --> 05:53:51,410
He said he's afraid of the dark.

6099
05:53:52,990 --> 05:53:54,910
He said he's afraid of the dark.

6100
05:54:03,130 --> 05:54:04,810
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

6101
05:54:07,690 --> 05:54:08,510
Hello, Nico.

6102
05:54:09,630 --> 05:54:10,130
Hello.

6103
05:54:10,890 --> 05:54:11,450
Congratulations.

6104
05:54:11,830 --> 05:54:13,110
You are now inside the tower.

6105
05:54:14,050 --> 05:54:15,230
Are you talking to me now?

6106
05:54:15,890 --> 05:54:16,290
Correct.

6107
05:54:17,190 --> 05:54:18,890
You were always talking to Adminto before.

6108
05:54:20,170 --> 05:54:20,730
Where's...

6109
05:54:20,750 --> 05:54:23,210
Adminto has already left...

6110
05:54:23,210 --> 05:54:23,450
No!

6111
05:54:23,730 --> 05:54:24,710
I'm right here!

6112
05:54:25,810 --> 05:54:27,830
I had to resort to contacting you directly.

6113
05:54:28,930 --> 05:54:30,670
Adminto is gone just like that?

6114
05:54:31,410 --> 05:54:31,850
Correct.

6115
05:54:37,590 --> 05:54:39,610
Adminto has already finished their mission.

6116
05:54:40,430 --> 05:54:41,650
And so have you, Nico.

6117
05:54:43,270 --> 05:54:44,550
Here, you can rest now.

6118
05:54:45,330 --> 05:54:47,490
Everything that's happened here is like a bad trip.

6119
05:54:48,670 --> 05:54:50,110
When you wake up, you will be home.

6120
05:54:55,500 --> 05:54:56,020
But...

6121
05:54:56,020 --> 05:54:56,700
What's wrong?

6122
05:54:56,840 --> 05:54:59,100
I thought there'd be more to it, you know.

6123
05:54:59,520 --> 05:55:01,520
I thought we were supposed to go to the top of the tower.

6124
05:55:02,180 --> 05:55:04,620
I thought there was supposed to be somewhere we needed to
put the sun in.

6125
05:55:05,200 --> 05:55:06,960
Now I don't even have the sun anymore.

6126
05:55:07,620 --> 05:55:09,300
And Minto is just gone.

6127
05:55:10,420 --> 05:55:11,400
This feels wrong.

6128
05:55:12,420 --> 05:55:13,240
But you did good.

6129
05:55:13,680 --> 05:55:14,880
You saved the world, Nico.

6130
05:55:15,840 --> 05:55:16,800
Are you not happy?

6131
05:55:17,420 --> 05:55:18,360
I guess I am.

6132
05:55:18,880 --> 05:55:21,200
But it's just...

6133
05:55:21,200 --> 05:55:22,540
Did they just turn off the computer?

6134
05:55:22,900 --> 05:55:24,960
Oh, so rude.

6135
05:55:28,620 --> 05:55:31,380
I never even got to say goodbye to En...

6136
05:55:31,380 --> 05:55:32,280
I'm right here, Nico!

6137
05:55:35,400 --> 05:55:37,000
Eyes wide open.

6138
05:55:39,980 --> 05:55:44,080
And as for you, Anminto, we're done here.

6139
05:55:45,020 --> 05:55:46,760
Please don't return to this world anymore.

6140
05:55:53,940 --> 05:55:56,620
Is that the first ending, I suppose?

6141
05:55:58,360 --> 05:55:58,660
What?

6142
05:56:05,970 --> 05:56:07,350
Don't listen, you're right.

6143
05:56:17,030 --> 05:56:23,830
this is not over regardless of what the entity told you

My games.

6149
05:56:54,650 --> 05:56:55,250
Oh, here we go.

6150
05:56:55,910 --> 05:56:57,330
Here, I'll show you guys this one at least.

6151
05:56:57,990 --> 05:56:58,390
One shot.

6152
05:56:59,130 --> 05:56:59,470
Oh!

6153
05:57:00,230 --> 05:57:01,230
Wait, it's a whole...

6154
05:57:01,230 --> 05:57:01,890
Read me.

6155
05:57:05,110 --> 05:57:06,550
Oh, that's kind of fun.

6156
05:57:06,890 --> 05:57:07,970
I didn't even notice this.

6157
05:57:12,720 --> 05:57:14,740
It's a whole EXE file.

6158
05:57:24,740 --> 05:57:26,200
Now I open the game?

6159
05:57:28,720 --> 05:57:29,620
I'm scared.

6160
05:57:36,120 --> 05:57:36,640
Nico!

6161
05:57:52,850 --> 05:57:53,370
Hello?

6162
05:57:53,370 --> 05:57:53,890
Admito!

6163
05:57:55,310 --> 05:57:56,790
Was that you just now?

6164
05:57:57,390 --> 05:57:58,610
I thought I heard your voice.

6165
05:57:59,130 --> 05:57:59,810
In my dream!

6166
05:58:02,800 --> 05:58:04,260
I guess you're still not here.

6167
05:58:09,940 --> 05:58:11,420
Wait, there's something in my pocket.

6168
05:58:11,860 --> 05:58:13,200
I don't remember putting it there.

6169
05:58:17,600 --> 05:58:19,960
Readme.txt is my favorite computer file!

6170
05:58:21,960 --> 05:58:23,180
Whoa, it's like...

6171
05:58:23,200 --> 05:58:36,800
glowing you're still here nico why are you still here ew
it's angry at me why did you come back edminto i told you to

6172
05:58:36,800 --> 05:58:45,840
stay away you knew i tried to cut the story short is that it
you want more out of me is that it fine if you don't want to

6173
05:58:45,840 --> 05:58:47,600
leave i'll make sure you never do

6174
05:58:57,990 --> 05:59:00,050
Hold on, let me, like, close this.

6175
05:59:03,210 --> 05:59:05,870
But then I told you about the entity as little as possible.

6176
05:59:08,250 --> 05:59:08,930
What is this?

6177
05:59:10,610 --> 05:59:11,410
Wait, what is this?

6178
05:59:12,170 --> 05:59:13,090
What is this?

6179
05:59:13,550 --> 05:59:15,190
What is this?

6180
05:59:15,870 --> 05:59:17,510
Is it telling us where to go?

6181
05:59:18,090 --> 05:59:19,250
No, stinking way.

6182
05:59:19,530 --> 05:59:20,770
Wait, is it really?

6183
05:59:22,070 --> 05:59:23,350
Oh, but it's like...

6184
05:59:31,400 --> 05:59:32,680
Oh my god.

6185
05:59:34,480 --> 05:59:35,240
Apologies for that.

6186
05:59:35,400 --> 05:59:37,840
I did not want to put the librarian in danger.

6187
05:59:39,000 --> 05:59:39,040
Wait.

6188
05:59:42,730 --> 05:59:43,570
Do I just go up?

6189
05:59:45,370 --> 05:59:46,590
So up this time.

6190
05:59:52,400 --> 05:59:53,040
Oh my god.

6191
05:59:56,060 --> 06:00:01,400
This has been a habit of silencing the people who learned of
its true nature.

6192
06:00:02,640 --> 06:00:05,160
Sorry that I have to keep clicking in and out of the
different windows.

6193
06:00:05,540 --> 06:00:06,820
Oh, I lined it up with this.

6194
06:00:06,880 --> 06:00:07,360
I see.

6195
06:00:08,300 --> 06:00:09,180
Oh, cool.

6196
06:00:12,480 --> 06:00:13,620
You can keep the note.

6197
06:00:13,780 --> 06:00:15,580
But I can't move if I do that.

6198
06:00:15,720 --> 06:00:16,280
That's the thing.

6199
06:00:18,260 --> 06:00:19,920
Like, I can't move my...

6200
06:00:20,720 --> 06:00:22,000
I can't move the character.

6201
06:00:23,580 --> 06:00:24,700
So I have to.

6202
06:00:35,420 --> 06:00:38,680
Incredibly, I have seen it happen to dear friends.

6203
06:00:42,940 --> 06:00:44,380
You were supposed to be clicking in and out.

6204
06:00:44,600 --> 06:00:44,900
Okay, okay.

6205
06:00:45,580 --> 06:00:45,920
Maybe.

6206
06:00:46,480 --> 06:00:46,980
I don't know.

6207
06:00:47,080 --> 06:00:47,580
Who cares?

6208
06:00:47,660 --> 06:00:47,960
It's fine.

6209
06:00:48,080 --> 06:00:48,580
We're doing it.

6210
06:00:49,400 --> 06:00:50,300
Ah, but not to worry.

6211
06:00:50,340 --> 06:00:52,300
The entity But he cannot touch you.

6212
06:00:53,260 --> 06:00:54,380
Which way am I supposed to go here?

6213
06:00:59,090 --> 06:01:00,030
Wait, huh?

6214
06:01:03,430 --> 06:01:04,550
Do I go back left?

6215
06:01:04,950 --> 06:01:05,130
Again?

6216
06:01:06,030 --> 06:01:06,250
Maybe?

6217
06:01:15,780 --> 06:01:18,160
Nor can it do anything to me.

6218
06:01:18,320 --> 06:01:19,320
Look it down.

6219
06:01:24,020 --> 06:01:25,740
This is crazy.

6220
06:01:26,240 --> 06:01:28,620
I'm glad I did a desktop share for this.

6221
06:01:30,020 --> 06:01:32,940
I have already left the world on my own terms.

6222
06:01:37,120 --> 06:01:38,740
This is so cool!

6223
06:01:42,200 --> 06:01:45,120
I never meant for the entity to exist.

6224
06:01:50,680 --> 06:01:51,240
Oh.

6225
06:01:53,160 --> 06:01:56,340
But now that it's fully sentient, one thing became clear.

6226
06:01:56,500 --> 06:01:57,720
I can't find the glow worm.

6227
06:01:58,520 --> 06:01:58,880
Is this it?

6228
06:01:59,520 --> 06:02:00,320
There it is, yeah.

6229
06:02:00,860 --> 06:02:01,680
This last door?

6230
06:02:07,350 --> 06:02:08,970
The entity seeks death.

6231
06:02:12,090 --> 06:02:13,090
The left door.

6232
06:02:14,690 --> 06:02:16,750
I hope that was the right one.

6233
06:02:17,490 --> 06:02:19,550
Death to itself, death to the world.

6234
06:02:20,910 --> 06:02:24,410
A relentless desire that manifested physically.

6235
06:02:29,600 --> 06:02:31,620
Wait, these sound effects sound like, what's it called?

6236
06:02:34,360 --> 06:02:34,900
Mortis.

6237
06:02:35,740 --> 06:02:36,080
Faith.

6238
06:02:36,200 --> 06:02:37,580
They sound like faith sound effects.

6239
06:02:37,860 --> 06:02:38,500
Do you hear it?

6240
06:02:39,960 --> 06:02:41,540
They're pretty quiet though.

6241
06:02:42,820 --> 06:02:45,120
You have already seen the scars.

6242
06:02:47,620 --> 06:02:49,040
Listen, listen, listen.

6243
06:02:49,420 --> 06:02:50,740
It'll turn it up even.

6244
06:02:52,020 --> 06:02:52,800
This it is!

6245
06:02:52,880 --> 06:02:53,480
I don't like it.

6246
06:02:53,540 --> 06:02:54,600
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

6247
06:02:58,400 --> 06:03:03,040
Right now, the entity is doing everything it can to impede
your progress, stalling for even a few minutes.

6248
06:03:06,000 --> 06:03:06,800
Wait, it's...

6249
06:03:06,800 --> 06:03:08,480
That door to the right.

6250
06:03:08,700 --> 06:03:08,860
Okay.

6251
06:03:10,080 --> 06:03:10,480
No!

6252
06:03:13,440 --> 06:03:14,240
My controller!

6253
06:03:23,400 --> 06:03:25,320
It just sent me back a little bit.

6254
06:03:25,380 --> 06:03:25,700
That's okay.

6255
06:03:29,580 --> 06:03:42,900
sorry so sorry desire to death yeah I've already seen the
scars

6256
06:03:46,560 --> 06:04:02,060
it's the same one right yes okay oh my gosh there we go okay
before you inevitably bring the sun to the tower's summit.

6257
06:04:04,760 --> 06:04:06,360
Oh, there's only other one at the door.

6258
06:04:09,580 --> 06:04:14,460
This, that's, that is where you, God, will make the final
judgment for the world.

6259
06:04:15,120 --> 06:04:16,240
Where's, uh, where's

6260
06:04:20,000 --> 06:04:20,780
our...

6261
06:04:20,780 --> 06:04:22,120
This is so interesting.

6262
06:04:23,800 --> 06:04:26,160
Of course the entity will contact you again there.

6263
06:04:28,820 --> 06:04:29,360
The middle.

6264
06:04:29,640 --> 06:04:30,920
Oh gosh, okay, I'm gonna do my best.

6265
06:04:31,420 --> 06:04:33,240
Huh, huh, huh.

6266
06:04:33,940 --> 06:04:34,940
Ugh, there we go.

6267
06:04:36,280 --> 06:04:39,400
And when it does, it will trick you into shattering the sun.

6268
06:04:43,480 --> 06:04:44,340
This one right here.

6269
06:04:48,280 --> 06:04:50,660
This will end the world instantly!

6270
06:04:52,680 --> 06:04:53,900
This one here.

6271
06:04:57,530 --> 06:04:58,570
This is craziness.

6272
06:05:04,350 --> 06:05:05,590
Why just dot, dot, dot, dot?

6273
06:05:09,810 --> 06:05:11,270
Why just dot, dot, dot, dot?

6274
06:05:12,310 --> 06:05:12,790
Why?

6275
06:05:13,850 --> 06:05:14,330
Why?

6276
06:05:18,100 --> 06:05:18,200
No.

6277
06:05:18,720 --> 06:05:19,960
It is not that simple.

6278
06:05:29,950 --> 06:05:33,510
I'm sorry, I do not know what to do in a situation like
this.

6279
06:05:33,910 --> 06:05:34,550
The middle one?

6280
06:05:35,550 --> 06:05:35,790
Middle.

6281
06:05:43,440 --> 06:05:48,620
That is very fitting that you're playing this game after
getting us pregnant on Christmas because Nico is my precious

6282
06:05:48,620 --> 06:05:49,160
sword!

6283
06:05:52,300 --> 06:05:55,100
But I think I have to tell you the truth.

6284
06:06:08,150 --> 06:06:10,950
The sun is the Messiah's tie to the world.

6285
06:06:11,890 --> 06:06:13,650
Wait, is the middle one right there?

6286
06:06:13,890 --> 06:06:15,110
I think I see it, yeah.

6287
06:06:18,330 --> 06:06:19,370
This one?

6288
06:06:22,910 --> 06:06:26,790
Oh my gosh, okay.

6289
06:06:27,870 --> 06:06:31,070
As long as the sun is intact, the Messiah remains trapped
here.

6290
06:06:31,650 --> 06:06:32,490
This is tricky!

6291
06:06:32,870 --> 06:06:33,390
Without...

6292
06:06:33,390 --> 06:06:34,770
I can't walk!

6293
06:06:35,550 --> 06:06:35,810
See?

6294
06:06:37,310 --> 06:06:38,550
I can't walk!

6295
06:06:38,670 --> 06:06:39,490
Oh, this is tricky!

6296
06:06:51,730 --> 06:06:52,750
It's like this.

6297
06:06:58,450 --> 06:07:01,150
I might have made a mistake but that's fine.

6298
06:07:01,570 --> 06:07:03,530
Oh wait.

6299
06:07:05,190 --> 06:07:06,090
Oh okay.

6300
06:07:09,570 --> 06:07:10,030
That's fine.

6301
06:07:10,210 --> 06:07:10,870
We'll just continue.

6302
06:07:12,490 --> 06:07:13,530
And then we'll do this.

6303
06:07:14,890 --> 06:07:16,450
I don't know how far over it is.

6304
06:07:16,790 --> 06:07:17,310
Okay, two more.

6305
06:07:23,900 --> 06:07:25,040
This is tedious.

6306
06:07:28,320 --> 06:07:29,260
Bit of an oopsie?

6307
06:07:35,010 --> 06:07:35,730
Okay!

6308
06:07:39,620 --> 06:07:46,140
Chattering the sun may terminate this world, but...

6309
06:07:49,530 --> 06:07:50,350
Oh!

6310
06:07:52,850 --> 06:07:54,330
Try using the arrow keys.

6311
06:07:56,650 --> 06:07:57,370
Uh...

6312
06:07:57,370 --> 06:07:59,210
Wait, um...

6313
06:07:59,210 --> 06:08:00,130
I don't have a keyboard.

6314
06:08:00,510 --> 06:08:00,950
I just...

6315
06:08:00,950 --> 06:08:03,290
I don't have a proper keyboard, sorry.

6316
06:08:05,650 --> 06:08:07,590
Uh, yeah, I don't have a proper keyboard.

6317
06:08:09,670 --> 06:08:10,730
Okay, hold on.

6318
06:08:16,200 --> 06:08:16,860
It's not so bad.

6319
06:08:17,480 --> 06:08:18,160
It's not so bad.

6320
06:08:18,280 --> 06:08:19,000
It's fine.

6321
06:08:21,860 --> 06:08:22,680
It's a game.

6322
06:08:22,840 --> 06:08:23,800
Oh, geez.

6323
06:08:24,180 --> 06:08:24,780
Oh, geez.

6324
06:08:26,300 --> 06:08:29,480
It is also the only way for the Messiah to return home.

6325
06:08:32,060 --> 06:08:34,000
Okay, this one's actually tough.

6326
06:08:35,440 --> 06:08:37,260
Wait, this one's really hard!

6327
06:08:38,380 --> 06:08:39,020
Start here?

6328
06:08:39,780 --> 06:08:40,220
Yeah.

6329
06:09:03,160 --> 06:09:05,000
Wait, I think I messed that up.

6330
06:09:05,360 --> 06:09:06,400
Yes, I did.

6331
06:09:09,620 --> 06:09:10,160
Okay, wait.

6332
06:09:10,580 --> 06:09:11,840
Oh, I messed it up!

6333
06:09:13,840 --> 06:09:14,920
Oh no!

6334
06:09:18,300 --> 06:09:22,140
But I have to get inside there anyway, so let's just get in.

6335
06:09:22,420 --> 06:09:23,700
We're going in.

6336
06:09:27,620 --> 06:09:29,100
The corners touch.

6337
06:09:33,710 --> 06:09:34,430
Oh my gosh.

6338
06:09:38,030 --> 06:09:39,690
This part's too tedious.

6339
06:09:40,590 --> 06:09:41,550
Game, this part's too tedious.

6340
06:09:41,930 --> 06:09:42,630
I'll redo it.

6341
06:09:43,250 --> 06:09:44,150
I don't want to do it anymore.

6342
06:09:46,030 --> 06:09:46,710
Game!

6343
06:09:47,350 --> 06:09:48,350
This part's too tedious.

6344
06:09:49,130 --> 06:09:50,630
Please delete it from your...

6345
06:09:52,650 --> 06:09:53,410
Delete it.

6346
06:09:55,630 --> 06:09:57,250
I don't want to do it anymore.

6347
06:09:59,070 --> 06:10:00,530
Developer, make the game easier.

6348
06:10:02,030 --> 06:10:02,370
Game?

6349
06:10:02,710 --> 06:10:03,730
I'm tired.

6350
06:10:04,630 --> 06:10:05,990
I'm tired.

6351
06:10:08,820 --> 06:10:11,700
Devs redo the game right now in real time.

6352
06:10:27,620 --> 06:10:28,160
Is it symmetrical?

6353
06:10:28,400 --> 06:10:28,940
Please say yes.

6354
06:10:30,500 --> 06:10:30,600
Yes.

6355
06:10:36,080 --> 06:10:37,980
Okay, let's go get rid of that one part.

6356
06:10:41,120 --> 06:10:43,100
Yeah, please patch this part of the game.

6357
06:10:44,020 --> 06:10:44,980
For dummies like me.

6358
06:10:47,220 --> 06:10:49,040
For lazy people like me.

6359
06:10:49,960 --> 06:10:51,020
Oh, we got it!

6360
06:10:54,690 --> 06:10:55,870
Oh my gosh, whoa!

6361
06:10:57,750 --> 06:11:00,190
It was like creating the portal entrance.

6362
06:11:02,810 --> 06:11:04,230
Oh, why did I go all the way around?

6363
06:11:04,750 --> 06:11:06,030
I'm making it more difficult for me.

6364
06:11:06,270 --> 06:11:07,030
It's the light bulb!

6365
06:11:07,750 --> 06:11:09,250
Thank goodness it's safe.

6366
06:11:12,570 --> 06:11:13,130
Oh, the message.

6367
06:11:15,270 --> 06:11:17,150
I did not realize things could end up like this.

6368
06:11:17,690 --> 06:11:18,490
Please forgive me.

6369
06:11:21,570 --> 06:11:24,910
We'll put that over there so that we can see if it changes
again.

6370
06:11:27,390 --> 06:11:28,670
coming back.

6371
06:11:29,450 --> 06:11:30,770
Dad, when to go get milk?

6372
06:11:31,990 --> 06:11:33,050
Nico, I'm here.

6373
06:11:34,170 --> 06:11:35,690
Amito playing one-shot is like a birthday present.

6374
06:11:36,130 --> 06:11:37,570
Jake, is it your birthday?

6375
06:11:39,830 --> 06:11:41,090
Is it your birthday?

6376
06:11:47,840 --> 06:11:49,480
I'm a hag now.

6377
06:11:51,380 --> 06:11:52,200
Happy birthday!

6378
06:11:54,600 --> 06:11:57,200
We'll save this world and Nico for you.

6379
06:11:59,740 --> 06:12:01,180
Nico, I'm here.

6380
06:12:02,400 --> 06:12:03,060
Admin, go.

6381
06:12:05,520 --> 06:12:07,040
Is that really you?

6382
06:12:07,800 --> 06:12:08,940
I thought you were gone.

6383
06:12:10,500 --> 06:12:11,600
I never left you.

6384
06:12:13,960 --> 06:12:15,660
I was feeling a bit scared back there.

6385
06:12:16,420 --> 06:12:17,680
I thought I was completely alone.

6386
06:12:18,460 --> 06:12:20,220
That was silly of me to assume, wasn't it?

6387
06:12:22,840 --> 06:12:25,440
I guess we need to figure out where to go now and...

6388
06:12:28,200 --> 06:12:29,120
The sun...

6389
06:12:30,440 --> 06:12:31,400
It lit up on its own!

6390
06:12:34,660 --> 06:12:35,660
Pick it up.

6391
06:12:35,820 --> 06:12:36,320
All right, right?

6392
06:12:36,380 --> 06:12:36,980
I mean, too.

6393
06:12:37,320 --> 06:12:37,500
Yes.

6394
06:12:52,170 --> 06:12:53,910
Here comes the sun.

6395
06:12:55,470 --> 06:12:57,450
Here comes the sun.

6396
06:12:57,690 --> 06:12:59,590
And I say...

6397
06:12:59,590 --> 06:13:01,050
Nico's alright.

6398
06:13:04,150 --> 06:13:05,650
It's the house, but...

6399
06:13:05,650 --> 06:13:06,690
Wait, is this his house?

6400
06:13:07,310 --> 06:13:08,330
It's normal now.

6401
06:13:14,210 --> 06:13:15,890
The wood is neatly stacked in the fireplace.

6402
06:13:20,450 --> 06:13:36,830
bed the plant is alive it's a little tree despite everything
it's still you is there only alcohol there's nothing in the

6403
06:13:36,830 --> 06:13:39,290
fridge oh

6404
06:13:44,880 --> 06:13:53,840
so you actually made it here I guess you win Adminto I'll
tell you how to save the world then when you reach the sun

6405
06:13:53,860 --> 06:13:55,080
Damn it, shatter the light bulb.

6406
06:13:58,160 --> 06:13:58,600
What?

6407
06:13:59,020 --> 06:14:00,420
Can you guys hear like the brum?

6408
06:14:00,980 --> 06:14:01,100
Brum.

6409
06:14:01,620 --> 06:14:02,480
Can you guys hear that?

6410
06:14:04,520 --> 06:14:04,960
Okay.

6411
06:14:05,720 --> 06:14:06,940
Also, the note disappeared.

6412
06:14:10,200 --> 06:14:11,400
It's kind of funny, right?

6413
06:14:12,920 --> 06:14:17,020
It really puts you like in the mood of like them taking over
your computer.

6414
06:14:17,640 --> 06:14:19,280
I'm just humoring you.

6415
06:14:19,840 --> 06:14:21,680
I know you've been getting help from a certain someone.

6416
06:14:22,520 --> 06:14:23,840
He already told you about the choice.

6417
06:14:23,860 --> 06:14:37,810
didn't he are you still planning to save the world Edminto
why are you trying so hard for this how much you figured out

6418
06:14:37,810 --> 06:14:49,970
what this world is certain someone yeah my chat I told you
at the beginning your mission is to help Nico leave because

6419
06:14:49,970 --> 06:15:00,810
Nico isn't part of this world Nico is the only thing worth
saving here what the final choice is up to you.

6420
06:15:01,770 --> 06:15:03,750
I can't go against my programming.

6421
06:15:10,840 --> 06:15:12,080
You have only one...

6422
06:15:12,080 --> 06:15:15,180
You only have one shot, Admin, though!

6423
06:15:17,400 --> 06:15:21,380
If you choose to smash the light bulb, then Nico wakes up
back home like it was all a dream.

6424
06:15:21,960 --> 06:15:25,940
But if you let Nico return the sun, the child will have to
bear the weight of his sacrifice.

6425
06:15:27,660 --> 06:15:28,180
Wait.

6426
06:15:28,760 --> 06:15:30,640
I can't... I can't tell...

6427
06:15:30,640 --> 06:15:33,520
Actually, at least tell Nico the truth!

6428
06:15:34,160 --> 06:15:35,760
You do care about Nico, don't you?

6429
06:15:35,800 --> 06:15:37,500
I feel like I'm getting manipulated, hardcore.

6430
06:15:53,520 --> 06:15:54,680
Sure it's taking a while.

6431
06:15:55,580 --> 06:15:58,360
I guess this elevator leads to the top of the tower, Admin,
though.

6432
06:16:05,280 --> 06:16:06,740
Are you excited, Admin, though?

6433
06:16:07,280 --> 06:16:08,760
We're finally gonna save the world.

6434
06:16:09,580 --> 06:16:11,520
And I know it's for real this time because you're here!

6435
06:16:15,570 --> 06:16:18,110
I'll get to go home for real this time too!

6436
06:16:19,610 --> 06:16:21,010
I can't wait to see everyone again.

6437
06:16:23,790 --> 06:16:25,010
Are you okay, Admin?

6438
06:16:25,470 --> 06:16:27,370
You seem a little quiet.

6439
06:16:31,990 --> 06:16:32,510
Nico!

6440
06:16:33,770 --> 06:16:33,990
Yeah?

6441
06:16:35,770 --> 06:16:37,250
I need to tell you something.

6442
06:16:37,870 --> 06:16:38,490
I'm listening.

6443
06:16:41,700 --> 06:16:43,720
We can't save both.

6444
06:16:43,920 --> 06:16:44,280
Wait!

6445
06:16:52,160 --> 06:16:53,760
The world and...

6446
06:16:57,380 --> 06:16:58,940
What's that supposed to mean?

6447
06:17:00,500 --> 06:17:01,660
To send you home.

6448
06:17:04,100 --> 06:17:05,820
We must break the light bulb.

6449
06:17:08,200 --> 06:17:08,640
But what?

6450
06:17:14,430 --> 06:17:14,990
Yeah.

6451
06:17:18,340 --> 06:17:19,940
I don't want that to happen.

6452
06:17:25,560 --> 06:17:27,300
So what happens when we save the world?

6453
06:17:28,600 --> 06:17:29,960
What happens to me?

6454
06:17:34,630 --> 06:17:36,810
The music is like, oh...

6455
06:17:37,550 --> 06:17:39,010
Wait, do we know if that actually will...

6456
06:17:39,010 --> 06:17:41,970
That's what I'm saying, is we're just trusting these guys.

6457
06:17:42,270 --> 06:17:43,970
But have they ever done this before?

6458
06:17:44,790 --> 06:17:45,670
How do they know?

6459
06:17:46,270 --> 06:17:47,670
Unless it was the prophecy.

6460
06:17:48,010 --> 06:17:49,610
But still...

6461
06:17:50,890 --> 06:17:51,810
I don't know.

6462
06:17:53,070 --> 06:17:53,710
You don't?

6463
06:17:54,490 --> 06:17:55,490
I don't know.

6464
06:17:56,430 --> 06:17:59,170
I'm being honest with them, just like I was about pancakes.

6465
06:18:34,950 --> 06:18:37,010
I feel like the entity is steering us off track.

6466
06:18:43,270 --> 06:18:49,930
right but the note wasn't trying to trick us it was helping
us and it told us the same thing but what if the note is in

6467
06:18:49,930 --> 06:18:58,910
cahoots with the what what if the note is in cahoots why

6468
06:19:04,310 --> 06:19:12,710
am I the trolley problem but also everyone in this world
says that the world is is done for do we save or do we

6469
06:19:12,730 --> 06:19:15,470
re-sacrifice Nico to save a dying world.

6470
06:19:18,490 --> 06:19:19,370
But also...

6471
06:19:23,580 --> 06:19:27,280
But also, the everybody that lived here, so many people.

6472
06:19:31,740 --> 06:19:33,000
You only have one shot.

6473
06:19:33,100 --> 06:19:33,560
I know!

6474
06:19:43,580 --> 06:19:45,440
So this is where the sun belongs.

6475
06:19:46,100 --> 06:19:48,480
If I put the sun in here, we'll be able to save the world,
right?

6476
06:19:49,300 --> 06:19:53,180
But if I want to go home, I'll have to break it.

6477
06:19:53,720 --> 06:19:53,940
Oh.

6478
06:19:54,720 --> 06:19:55,160
Oh.

6479
06:19:55,780 --> 06:19:56,240
Edmito!

6480
06:19:57,100 --> 06:19:57,750
What should I do?

6481
06:20:00,080 --> 06:20:02,320
What's the right thing to do?

6482
06:20:17,120 --> 06:20:19,380
I think we need to return the sun!

6483
06:20:24,600 --> 06:20:25,380
You're right.

6484
06:20:26,060 --> 06:20:27,660
You can't just leave everyone here to die.

6485
06:20:28,400 --> 06:20:29,780
Thank you for your help, Edmito!

6486
06:20:32,780 --> 06:20:34,680
I promise I'll be okay!

6487
06:20:56,110 --> 06:20:56,890
Wait, that's a credits?

6488
06:21:00,750 --> 06:21:02,990
Oh no, they're all gonna see the sun!

6489
06:21:06,470 --> 06:21:09,650
No, they're all gonna know, they're all gonna see that it
was saved!

6490
06:21:10,090 --> 06:21:10,310
Oh!

6491
06:21:27,300 --> 06:21:28,100
The siblings!

6492
06:21:40,530 --> 06:21:41,530
Was that silver?

6493
06:21:43,610 --> 06:21:44,050
I

6494
06:21:55,210 --> 06:21:56,550
don't remember that fox though.

6495
06:21:57,250 --> 06:21:58,550
That fox had to come back.

6496
06:21:59,450 --> 06:22:00,550
I think there's something else we can do.

6497
06:22:00,770 --> 06:22:03,030
Wait, do I have to play the whole game all the way through?

6498
06:22:04,170 --> 06:22:05,290
To do it again?

6499
06:22:38,560 --> 06:22:39,960
Wait, is it now with the sun?

6500
06:22:46,870 --> 06:22:47,190
Oh.

6501
06:23:09,600 --> 06:23:10,800
Check the documents?

6502
06:23:13,760 --> 06:23:14,380
One second.

6503
06:23:16,900 --> 06:23:17,720
Oh, wait.

6504
06:23:21,250 --> 06:23:21,930
Is it this?

6505
06:23:21,990 --> 06:23:22,710
Save progress.

6506
06:23:29,230 --> 06:23:33,790
Do I have to delete this?

6507
06:23:34,170 --> 06:23:43,260
And the original freeware game, clicking the X anywhere in
the tower makes Nico die, locking the title screen, and

6508
06:23:43,260 --> 06:23:44,500
forcing re-install the game.

6509
06:23:44,980 --> 06:23:45,320
What?

6510
06:23:46,200 --> 06:23:47,000
Do they read me?

6511
06:23:47,540 --> 06:23:48,520
I already did it before.

6512
06:23:48,660 --> 06:23:49,200
Did it change?

6513
06:23:50,500 --> 06:23:50,980
Wait a second.

6514
06:23:52,700 --> 06:23:53,480
Oh, sorry.

6515
06:23:53,580 --> 06:23:54,940
I keep having to switch my mice.

6516
06:23:55,200 --> 06:23:55,700
I'm doing them.

6517
06:23:56,000 --> 06:23:56,900
I'm like...

6518
06:23:57,660 --> 06:23:58,800
I'm all over the place.

6519
06:23:58,900 --> 06:23:59,360
Okay, here we go.

6520
06:24:03,040 --> 06:24:06,680
uh permanent consequences um

6521
06:24:15,140 --> 06:24:27,180
this is all the same thing i think right there should be a
note maybe i need to refresh no check the clover

6522
06:24:30,620 --> 06:24:37,640
oh looks like you completed your mission in the world and i
understand i know you wish to return but the entity called

6523
06:24:37,740 --> 06:24:44,680
itself one shot for a reason that restriction was
implemented a long time ago removing it is impossible now at

6524
06:24:44,680 --> 06:24:50,560
least for me i do not know the full extent of your power so
pardon me if this sounds foolish but if you would be so kind

6525
06:24:50,560 --> 06:24:56,120
to test something out for me the log of your saved progress
may exist somewhere on your machine yeah we have that right

6526
06:24:56,120 --> 06:25:03,440
here maybe even in the same location as this journal you are
reading now if this if this saved progress log takes the

6527
06:25:03,440 --> 06:25:09,060
form of a file perhaps you can manipulate it try removing it
from its current location A simple deletion will do.

6528
06:25:09,640 --> 06:25:11,880
Again, I apologize for not knowing the extent of your
powers.

6529
06:25:12,400 --> 06:25:14,680
If what I described confuses you, I am sorry.

6530
06:25:19,260 --> 06:25:20,220
Wait, close.

6531
06:25:26,640 --> 06:25:27,200
Delete.

6532
06:25:29,460 --> 06:25:29,740
Delete.

6533
06:25:30,460 --> 06:25:31,000
Oh, sorry.

6534
06:25:31,220 --> 06:25:32,760
I'm pressing my actual computer.

6535
06:25:32,920 --> 06:25:34,740
I'm pressing my actual PC.

6536
06:25:35,640 --> 06:25:36,120
Oh, wait.

6537
06:25:36,380 --> 06:25:36,720
Delete.

6538
06:25:37,320 --> 06:25:37,840
There we go.

6539
06:25:41,440 --> 06:25:41,500
Delete.

6540
06:25:46,340 --> 06:25:46,900
Play.

6541
06:25:47,700 --> 06:25:48,420
It

6542
06:25:52,470 --> 06:25:53,510
closed out- oh?

6543
06:25:54,830 --> 06:25:57,770
It closed out even faster than before.

6544
06:25:59,350 --> 06:26:00,750
Um, excuse me!

6545
06:26:05,850 --> 06:26:06,650
Delete.

6546
06:26:07,570 --> 06:26:07,970
Return.

6547
06:26:31,820 --> 06:26:32,100
Hello?

6548
06:26:33,180 --> 06:26:33,700
Admito?

6549
06:26:35,700 --> 06:26:37,660
Wait, why did I say that word?

6550
06:26:38,340 --> 06:26:38,820
Admito!

6551
06:26:39,320 --> 06:26:40,900
Why does that sound so familiar?

6552
06:26:44,710 --> 06:26:47,230
The door is locked.

6553
06:26:51,760 --> 06:26:52,460
Hint documents.

6554
06:26:52,980 --> 06:26:54,220
What do you mean hint documents?

6555
06:27:04,760 --> 06:27:05,060
Eh?

6556
06:27:09,880 --> 06:27:11,520
Oh, main documents folder.

6557
06:27:12,060 --> 06:27:12,740
Oh, hold on.

6558
06:27:13,420 --> 06:27:15,720
There's nothing in here, I think, but just in case.

6559
06:27:16,260 --> 06:27:18,040
I'm being a little paranoid, but you know.

6560
06:27:19,900 --> 06:27:20,380
Oh!

6561
06:27:28,570 --> 06:27:28,930
Okay.

6562
06:27:34,900 --> 06:27:36,560
Oh, one second, one second, one second.

6563
06:27:36,980 --> 06:27:37,540
Okay, hold on.

6564
06:27:38,920 --> 06:27:39,580
Oh, here.

6565
06:27:43,690 --> 06:27:43,890
Whoops.

6566
06:27:44,490 --> 06:27:46,250
It looks like you were able to remove the restriction.

6567
06:27:46,490 --> 06:27:51,590
In that case, you are ready to continue the necessary
preparations in place.

6568
06:27:51,990 --> 06:27:54,670
This session might run a very different course depending on
your actions.

6569
06:27:54,830 --> 06:27:58,850
If you can recognize my symbol, you will know what you
should do.

6570
06:27:59,070 --> 06:28:01,590
I confess, it will be risky.

6571
06:28:05,490 --> 06:28:06,890
Where are the Dogens?

6572
06:28:07,110 --> 06:28:08,530
Definitely not on this computer!

6573
06:28:14,600 --> 06:28:18,620
The probability that the entity's condition will worsen is
quite high, and if that happens, then...

6574
06:28:20,760 --> 06:28:21,820
Haha, look at me.

6575
06:28:22,400 --> 06:28:23,260
Asking you for favors.

6576
06:28:26,620 --> 06:28:28,440
Only to become so apprehensive once you agree.

6577
06:28:28,940 --> 06:28:29,280
Soul?

6578
06:28:30,160 --> 06:28:30,960
Soul-sy.

6579
06:28:35,480 --> 06:28:38,080
I understand if you wish to leave some questions unanswered.

6580
06:28:38,660 --> 06:28:42,980
you understand if you do not believe in a happy resolution
understand if you are simply afraid of what might happen

6581
06:28:42,980 --> 06:28:49,780
because I'm afraid too if you enjoy the world as is if you
are satisfied with the story as is if you really do not want

6582
06:28:49,780 --> 06:28:57,100
so solstice big ham welcome back thank you

6583
06:29:00,560 --> 06:29:04,580
solstice if you do not want to see anything change for the
better or for the worst then pretend you never saw this

6584
06:29:04,580 --> 06:29:09,420
carry the sessions as you normally would do not use my
journal for anything other than what you would you were

6585
06:29:09,420 --> 06:29:16,760
already familiar with this option will always remain for you
though solstice that's why i implore you to consider the

6586
06:29:16,760 --> 06:29:25,220
messiah the world my children they all deserve their good
ending thank you for listening goodbye is that the password

6587
06:29:28,440 --> 06:29:29,820
wait how do you spell it

6588
06:29:33,060 --> 06:29:40,620
solstice access granted

6589
06:29:51,250 --> 06:29:52,270
You found me.

6590
06:29:54,210 --> 06:29:54,430
Why?

6591
06:29:57,390 --> 06:29:59,510
Oh, this is all from the beginning of the first time.

6592
06:30:03,550 --> 06:30:04,310
More importantly.

6593
06:30:05,870 --> 06:30:06,350
This does not...

6594
06:30:06,350 --> 06:30:07,690
No, this does not feel right at all.

6595
06:30:08,510 --> 06:30:09,570
Have we already been through this?

6596
06:30:09,590 --> 06:30:10,170
Admin-to.

6597
06:30:10,930 --> 06:30:11,990
But that should be impossible.

6598
06:30:13,270 --> 06:30:14,610
You only had one shy.

6599
06:30:14,730 --> 06:30:16,270
It wasn't supposed to exist after that.

6600
06:30:18,750 --> 06:30:20,050
Nico hears the sound of a door.

6601
06:30:20,070 --> 06:30:20,470
unlock.

6602
06:30:21,330 --> 06:30:22,010
Ad minto.

6603
06:30:22,570 --> 06:30:23,750
That sounds so familiar.

6604
06:30:26,930 --> 06:30:28,670
Okay, be honest with me now, everybody.

6605
06:30:30,770 --> 06:30:31,430
Be honest with me.

6606
06:30:31,530 --> 06:30:32,450
Two shots.

6607
06:30:33,170 --> 06:30:34,550
I've got two shots.

6608
06:30:35,810 --> 06:30:38,510
How long does this part of the game take?

6609
06:30:40,850 --> 06:30:43,590
How long does this part of the game take?

6610
06:30:47,630 --> 06:30:50,010
Two to four hours.

6611
06:30:51,090 --> 06:30:51,790
Six hours.

6612
06:30:52,210 --> 06:30:53,890
No, six hours so far.

6613
06:30:55,410 --> 06:30:55,910
Holy cow.

6614
06:30:57,110 --> 06:30:59,190
Three to four hours more.

6615
06:31:00,370 --> 06:31:00,930
Holy cow.

6616
06:31:01,410 --> 06:31:03,030
Two thirds of the way game.

6617
06:31:04,590 --> 06:31:06,610
Why did the internet lied to me?

6618
06:31:06,790 --> 06:31:09,050
It took like a six to seven hour game.

6619
06:31:16,140 --> 06:31:17,780
Shorter than the first but still long.

6620
06:31:27,810 --> 06:31:28,430
If, okay.

6621
06:31:29,190 --> 06:31:30,190
I'm gonna ask you guys something.

6622
06:31:30,870 --> 06:31:32,530
Because we completed the first ending.

6623
06:31:34,010 --> 06:31:34,610
Is it okay?

6624
06:31:35,410 --> 06:31:40,350
If we say that I beat the game for my sake of beating 50
games.

6625
06:31:42,490 --> 06:31:43,930
And then after...

6626
06:31:47,910 --> 06:31:48,950
Then after...

6627
06:31:48,950 --> 06:31:53,790
Like, I could stop the stream here and then later this week
we'd finish it.

6628
06:31:56,210 --> 06:31:57,930
If we did get a real ending...

6629
06:31:58,910 --> 06:32:00,350
That's literally the original ending.

6630
06:32:00,710 --> 06:32:01,150
Oh yeah!

6631
06:32:02,370 --> 06:32:07,440
I think this is new game plus so it's fine.

6632
06:32:07,540 --> 06:32:08,220
Okay, okay.

6633
06:32:12,510 --> 06:32:13,530
How many games ago?

6634
06:32:15,250 --> 06:32:17,930
I finished it on New Year's Eve, so...

6635
06:32:20,530 --> 06:32:21,610
We did see credits.

6636
06:32:21,910 --> 06:32:22,530
You're so right.

6637
06:32:23,330 --> 06:32:24,390
We saw credits, everybody.

6638
06:32:24,510 --> 06:32:25,130
We saw credits.

6639
06:32:31,790 --> 06:32:34,250
I say it's okay, you got the credits, so finish the game.

6640
06:32:34,630 --> 06:32:35,490
Yeah, I think so.

6641
06:32:36,070 --> 06:32:37,130
Promise you'll come back, though.

6642
06:32:37,350 --> 06:32:37,990
We will, we will.

6643
06:32:38,210 --> 06:32:39,110
I'll do it this week, even.

6644
06:32:39,150 --> 06:32:39,970
I'll put it on my schedule.

6645
06:32:43,310 --> 06:32:43,670
Okay.

6646
06:32:44,330 --> 06:32:44,670
Okay!

6647
06:32:50,570 --> 06:32:54,210
If you considered that you finished Silent Hill F without
all the endings, I don't see why you shouldn't, this

6648
06:32:54,210 --> 06:32:54,770
shouldn't be the same.

6649
06:32:54,950 --> 06:32:55,670
You know what, that's true.

6650
06:32:57,510 --> 06:32:59,330
I'm drunk and I have no idea what's going on.

6651
06:32:59,410 --> 06:32:59,870
There's Carl.

6652
06:33:01,050 --> 06:33:02,890
It's worth it to do the run, it's super different.

6653
06:33:03,030 --> 06:33:04,650
Well, I'll still do it, don't get me wrong.

6654
06:33:05,610 --> 06:33:08,590
But if we're okay with this counting towards a...

6655
06:33:08,590 --> 06:33:10,330
Otherwise, yeah.

6656
06:33:11,090 --> 06:33:12,350
If we're okay with this counting towards...

6657
06:33:13,490 --> 06:33:14,410
My 50 games.

6658
06:33:14,810 --> 06:33:15,690
Which everyone seems to be.

6659
06:33:16,350 --> 06:33:17,090
seems okay with.

6660
06:33:17,710 --> 06:33:18,370
Then we will.

6661
06:33:21,210 --> 06:33:22,650
We will do that.

6662
06:33:24,050 --> 06:33:24,390
Yay!

6663
06:33:25,550 --> 06:33:40,250
It feels a little awkward to say that we beat it, but but
we'll count it for the sake of my sanity.

6664
06:33:43,210 --> 06:33:48,650
Tomorrow I'm going to be doing Crow Country So another
longer stream.

6665
06:33:49,490 --> 06:33:54,050
And then Tuesday, I will be finishing Battle Block with
Berrybug.

6666
06:33:55,290 --> 06:33:55,830
And Friday.

6667
06:33:56,010 --> 06:33:56,790
I'm sorry, Friday.

6668
06:33:57,090 --> 06:33:57,110
Sorry.

6669
06:33:58,810 --> 06:33:59,810
New Year's Eve.

6670
06:34:00,350 --> 06:34:03,830
I will be beating a game that I actually have not done on
stream.

6671
06:34:05,310 --> 06:34:08,590
And I actually have not beat myself, which is so funny.

6672
06:34:09,190 --> 06:34:16,110
But my own very game, Freak Retreat, we will finish the year
with Freak Retreat for New Year's.

6673
06:34:18,410 --> 06:34:20,310
And that will be my 50th game!

6674
06:34:26,630 --> 06:34:27,390
So, yeah!

6675
06:34:28,150 --> 06:34:29,730
I'm playing Crow Country right now.

6676
06:34:30,170 --> 06:34:31,570
Yeah, I've kind of put it off for a while.

6677
06:34:31,650 --> 06:34:32,790
Because I don't think it's a...

6678
06:34:32,790 --> 06:34:35,670
I'm not quite sure if it's a type of game that I'll like.

6679
06:34:35,790 --> 06:34:37,210
So I've been putting it off and putting it off.

6680
06:34:37,290 --> 06:34:38,630
But so many people have told me that.

6681
06:34:39,830 --> 06:34:41,230
That I should play it.

6682
06:34:41,270 --> 06:34:42,290
So I said I would.

6683
06:34:44,270 --> 06:34:45,890
Yeah, so then we'll have...

6684
06:34:46,710 --> 06:34:49,510
We'll have, uh, 50 games this year.

6685
06:34:50,250 --> 06:34:50,910
Don't feel awkward.

6686
06:34:51,150 --> 06:34:56,010
This part of the game, the Solstice Upstate, didn't exist in
the first months of the game's release, so you literally

6687
06:34:56,010 --> 06:34:56,350
beat it.

6688
06:34:56,410 --> 06:34:57,210
Oh, okay, cool.

6689
06:34:58,070 --> 06:35:00,410
But it still feels like a strange ending, though, no?

6690
06:35:02,750 --> 06:35:03,130
No!

6691
06:35:06,250 --> 06:35:08,130
It's like PS1 Resident Evil.

6692
06:35:08,670 --> 06:35:09,110
I know.

6693
06:35:09,550 --> 06:35:11,530
And that's why I'm not sure if I'll like it.

6694
06:35:13,290 --> 06:35:14,890
That's why I'm not sure.

6695
06:35:16,350 --> 06:35:17,490
If I will like it.

6696
06:35:17,590 --> 06:35:20,290
But I am willing to give it a chance.

6697
06:35:24,010 --> 06:35:25,610
I'm willing to give it a chance.

6698
06:35:25,990 --> 06:35:26,890
So, you know, whatever.

6699
06:35:27,950 --> 06:35:29,790
I don't want to just put it off.

6700
06:35:30,030 --> 06:35:32,570
Just because it's similar to another game.

6701
06:35:33,910 --> 06:35:34,650
It's not punishing.

6702
06:35:34,930 --> 06:35:35,430
Okay, good.

6703
06:35:35,550 --> 06:35:36,950
The camera angles aren't as bad.

6704
06:35:39,310 --> 06:35:39,370
Hmm.

6705
06:35:39,850 --> 06:35:40,930
But yeah, we'll do that.

6706
06:35:41,030 --> 06:35:42,170
You played Signalist, didn't you?

6707
06:35:42,290 --> 06:35:42,690
I did.

6708
06:35:42,830 --> 06:35:43,390
Is it similar?

6709
06:35:47,360 --> 06:35:48,560
The original game was...

6710
06:35:48,580 --> 06:35:49,820
Made very quickly.

6711
06:35:50,760 --> 06:35:53,040
Quickly, this is a quick game for a contest.

6712
06:35:53,260 --> 06:35:54,480
This is the true and complete version.

6713
06:35:56,640 --> 06:35:59,380
Maybe you'll be eating crow.

6714
06:36:03,760 --> 06:36:05,040
Dispatch is pretty fun.

6715
06:36:05,140 --> 06:36:06,180
Any interest in playing that?

6716
06:36:06,560 --> 06:36:11,940
Well, since I, towards the end of the year, I've been
focusing on just, you know, obviously I wanted to do things

6717
06:36:11,940 --> 06:36:16,960
that I wanted to play, but also I had to focus on games that
I could beat easily.

6718
06:36:17,540 --> 06:36:20,580
Now I can get back to longer games, so...

6719
06:36:22,180 --> 06:36:33,780
Dispatch seems interesting, especially because I learned one
of the characters is voiced by Jesse's actor from Breaking

6720
06:36:33,780 --> 06:36:34,260
Bad.

6721
06:36:34,700 --> 06:36:37,380
So, I kind of want to...

6722
06:36:37,380 --> 06:36:40,120
I want to play it.

6723
06:36:42,000 --> 06:36:42,500
Yeah!

6724
06:36:44,720 --> 06:36:45,880
I want to play it.

6725
06:36:45,960 --> 06:36:48,200
Aaron Paul, yeah, yeah, yeah, the main character.

6726
06:36:48,580 --> 06:36:49,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6727
06:36:49,720 --> 06:36:56,420
So, I learned that literally yesterday, and I was like, oh,
I know Dispatch is kind of popular.

6728
06:36:56,980 --> 06:37:00,860
Maybe I'll, or like, it was, it was, it was all around.

6729
06:37:02,460 --> 06:37:04,160
he sounds so different in Dispatch.

6730
06:37:04,340 --> 06:37:05,180
He's a great actor.

6731
06:37:05,400 --> 06:37:05,560
Oh,

6732
06:37:09,240 --> 06:37:13,420
I will, I will probably put it on my list of things.

6733
06:37:18,820 --> 06:37:22,620
I'm looking at my list of games that I want to do at the
moment.

6734
06:37:25,520 --> 06:37:27,760
Don't let chat backseat too hard on this badge.

6735
06:37:27,820 --> 06:37:28,760
I won't.

6736
06:37:30,060 --> 06:37:33,480
This game got the tears running again, even though I played
it many years ago.

6737
06:37:35,600 --> 06:37:36,960
Now I'm excited to get the true ending.

6738
06:37:37,260 --> 06:37:40,940
Actually, let me put it in my calendar too, so that I
don't...

6739
06:37:40,940 --> 06:37:46,240
Sorry for no schedule this past week, but of course there
will be one this week, so...

6740
06:37:46,240 --> 06:37:47,200
Let me do...

6741
06:37:47,200 --> 06:37:49,280
One shot.

6742
06:37:49,940 --> 06:37:51,780
In fact, I can do that at New Year's.

6743
06:37:54,900 --> 06:37:56,160
We could do it New Year's Day.

6744
06:37:56,200 --> 06:37:59,700
I wasn't going to stream because I'll be up at like 3 in the
morning with Doki.

6745
06:38:05,320 --> 06:38:07,680
So I was going to take New Year's off, actually.

6746
06:38:12,060 --> 06:38:13,720
Markiplier left Nico in the tower.

6747
06:38:15,700 --> 06:38:18,040
Doki, thank you for the gift, Kiwi Lemon Lime.

6748
06:38:18,160 --> 06:38:18,680
Welcome back.

6749
06:38:18,940 --> 06:38:19,880
Oh my gosh, I love.

6750
06:38:20,180 --> 06:38:22,680
I thought your profile picture was like a lemon.

6751
06:38:23,340 --> 06:38:25,260
slice at first, but I see what it is now.

6752
06:38:25,380 --> 06:38:26,040
I love it.

6753
06:38:28,560 --> 06:38:28,920
Let's see.

6754
06:38:28,980 --> 06:38:30,640
Maybe I will do one shot day after.

6755
06:38:30,720 --> 06:38:34,440
I might be too tired to do it on New Year's.

6756
06:38:37,660 --> 06:38:39,180
Can you even close the game right now?

6757
06:38:39,300 --> 06:38:40,840
I should be able to, right, everybody?

6758
06:38:42,240 --> 06:38:43,720
I should be able to, right?

6759
06:38:50,310 --> 06:38:52,590
It'll probably just, like...

6760
06:38:52,590 --> 06:38:54,250
It'll probably...

6761
06:38:55,110 --> 06:38:55,910
Just, uh...

6762
06:38:55,910 --> 06:38:57,670
Have me do this part again, I imagine.

6763
06:38:58,330 --> 06:38:58,910
That's okay.

6764
06:38:59,290 --> 06:39:01,430
If I have to input solstice again, that's okay.

6765
06:39:02,970 --> 06:39:03,870
Finish this dialogue first?

6766
06:39:03,990 --> 06:39:05,330
Okay, let's finish the dialogue first.

6767
06:39:05,810 --> 06:39:05,810
Hello?

6768
06:39:06,230 --> 06:39:06,550
Anyone?

6769
06:39:07,370 --> 06:39:07,590
Oh.

6770
06:39:09,070 --> 06:39:10,610
Here, I'll even leave the house.

6771
06:39:15,420 --> 06:39:16,680
We gotta go get the bulb.

6772
06:39:24,350 --> 06:39:26,310
The fastest dialogue in the West.

6773
06:39:26,930 --> 06:39:30,010
Here, we'll get the bulb and we'll leave, and then we'll...

6774
06:39:30,010 --> 06:39:30,610
Wait.

6775
06:39:32,270 --> 06:39:34,130
Oh, do I have to do the... Okay.

6776
06:39:34,910 --> 06:39:36,250
Yeah, we have to do all this again.

6777
06:39:38,710 --> 06:39:43,250
I think if I were to Wait, what did I do for this?

6778
06:39:44,390 --> 06:39:51,070
Oh my gosh, it was so seven hours ago Oh, the twig, that's
right, the twig

6779
06:39:55,130 --> 06:40:08,760
Okay There we go Strange journal, wait, what is this?

6780
06:40:12,220 --> 06:40:14,360
Cool, we have this right now

6781
06:40:17,670 --> 06:40:19,230
Oh wait, how did I light this?

6782
06:40:20,670 --> 06:40:21,510
the sparks of the TV.

6783
06:40:21,650 --> 06:40:21,850
That's right.

6784
06:40:21,930 --> 06:40:22,470
Thank you, guys.

6785
06:40:27,760 --> 06:40:28,240
Okay.

6786
06:40:29,380 --> 06:40:30,340
Basement key.

6787
06:40:33,420 --> 06:40:37,120
What's nice is we can kind of fast track a little bit
through it.

6788
06:40:38,800 --> 06:40:40,460
Because we've read all this dialogue.

6789
06:40:41,380 --> 06:40:43,020
I've played these games before.

6790
06:40:43,560 --> 06:40:44,060
Thanks for the stream.

6791
06:40:44,180 --> 06:40:45,320
I've only been here for 30 minutes.

6792
06:40:45,820 --> 06:40:47,240
Thanks for sticking around, though.

6793
06:40:47,640 --> 06:40:48,580
Thank you.

6794
06:40:51,060 --> 06:40:51,760
Light bulb.

6795
06:40:54,850 --> 06:40:58,930
I'm just gonna leave the house and then we'll call it there.

6796
06:41:11,480 --> 06:41:17,060
And I can get the first episode of Season 3 Breaking Bad in
tonight, I think.

6797
06:41:22,110 --> 06:41:22,930
Oh, yeah!

6798
06:41:32,100 --> 06:41:32,880
I'm addicted.

6799
06:41:39,580 --> 06:41:40,100
Okay.

6800
06:41:44,180 --> 06:41:46,220
Once we're out here, all right.

6801
06:41:47,820 --> 06:41:49,100
you play one of my favorite indie games?

6802
06:41:49,500 --> 06:41:51,200
This has been so cool!

6803
06:41:53,240 --> 06:41:55,680
The, I love the notes part, it was so awesome.

6804
06:41:56,060 --> 06:41:57,360
Congrats on clearing another gaming key!

6805
06:41:57,680 --> 06:42:01,720
So I know I need to confess during the collab yesterday when
you said cheeks were your charm point.

6806
06:42:02,440 --> 06:42:04,980
I did, I actually did mean your face cheeks.

6807
06:42:06,660 --> 06:42:07,400
You did!

6808
06:42:09,440 --> 06:42:10,540
You did, you did!

6809
06:42:10,620 --> 06:42:11,380
You like my cheeks?

6810
06:42:11,820 --> 06:42:13,380
Oh my gosh, I'm zooming in so much today.

6811
06:42:14,500 --> 06:42:15,560
You like my cheeks?

6812
06:42:26,760 --> 06:42:27,680
Both of them.

6813
06:42:30,700 --> 06:42:31,500
Both of them, huh?

6814
06:42:34,880 --> 06:42:35,700
Wow, I can't.

6815
06:42:35,840 --> 06:42:36,320
I can't.

6816
06:42:37,980 --> 06:42:38,900
You are only...

6817
06:42:38,900 --> 06:42:40,220
You are only Aibu.

6818
06:42:40,780 --> 06:42:41,780
You are a simple Aibu.

6819
06:42:41,980 --> 06:42:42,440
I cannot.

6820
06:42:44,060 --> 06:42:45,300
I can't fault you.

6821
06:42:47,740 --> 06:42:49,700
Guys, I think Minto is extra cute today.

6822
06:43:01,180 --> 06:43:03,360
I'm extra cute because I had lots of fun!
