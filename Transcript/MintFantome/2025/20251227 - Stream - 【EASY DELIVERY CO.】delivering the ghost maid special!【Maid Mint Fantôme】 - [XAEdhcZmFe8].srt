00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,570
Hello, hello.

2
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,310
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

3
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,190
Hello, hello.

4
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,110
Hello, hello.

5
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,810
Congrats on the concert.

6
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,330
Thank you.

7
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,350
If you saw and...

8
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,310
Oh no, I'm already yawning.

9
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,190
Sorry.

10
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,010
Oh my gosh, I'm still so sleepy.

11
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,670
Today, all I did was watch...

12
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,170
All I did was watch Breaking Bad.

13
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:47,730
And I watched K-Pop Demon Hunters because I got Netflix so
that I could watch Breaking Bad.

14
00:03:51,970 --> 00:04:01,230
are you having been watching it i i don't think i would
still be binging it if i didn't like it so much i think i

15
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:14,170
was like oh wait now hot dog indeed i was like if i if i
could do if i have netflix for one thing so basically what

16
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:20,250
i'm gonna do is i'm gonna try and watch as much breaking bad
as i can And then I will...

17
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,850
Also, watch everything else on Netflix that I wanted to
watch, but I never wanted to get Netflix for.

18
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,310
Haven't met Gus yet.

19
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,710
And then I will...

20
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,530
I will... I will then cancel Netflix.

21
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,090
Hello, Ammito, and I...

22
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,600
Uh...

23
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,440
What was that?

24
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,700
What was that?

25
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,500
There was like a force stopping me.

26
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,740
from saying Aibu.

27
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,580
Sorry.

28
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm a little...

29
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,260
Still, my voice is a little icky.

30
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,700
They give over to Jars.

31
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,520
Thank you!

32
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,200
Minto, we need to cook.

33
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,300
Your voice is no longer dead.

34
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,640
It's only a little dead.

35
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,180
The Force hates Aibu.

36
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,780
If I can't say it...

37
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,700
If I can't say it...

38
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,980
Normal.

39
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,420
Are you ever going to settle on a fan name?

40
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,700
I literally just did!

41
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,220
What are you talking about?

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,000
What was I saying?

43
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,190
I don't remember.

44
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,000
But yeah.

45
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,180
I boo-boo.

46
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,360
My concert?

47
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Oh, did you see the...

48
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,360
Wait, hold on.

49
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,540
I have the image.

50
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,740
I have the image.

51
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,760
image, image, image, what's it called?

52
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,880
What's the, what is this one?

53
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:26,660
I didn't know when they were going to announce it.

54
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,620
Rather, when I said that I would have an announcement, I
thought I would be announcing it.

55
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,300
But it was announced on Twitter.

56
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:52,000
But yeah, be doing an in-person 3d jazz concert with a live
band and some special guests um so far most of them are

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,980
confirmed there's one person that i am waiting to hopefully
hear back from but but it should still be a really great

58
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,880
show Yes.

59
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,860
What was I going to say?

60
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,060
It's at this place called the Peppermint Club, which, of
course, is like such a great...

61
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,380
Oh, my gosh.

62
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,380
Wow, thank you!

63
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,580
Let this red super be my catalyst to win the Hunger Games
and get a ticket.

64
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,340
That's like, oh, it was so fun.

65
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,280
Thank you.

66
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,540
Thank you.

67
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,140
I...

68
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,060
I...

69
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
What was it?

70
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,760
Uh...

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:51,800
um the name the the club name itself is just so perfect but
also um the club itself is quite small uh so if you don't

72
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:00,340
get a ticket that's totally okay um there it would also it
will also be streaming so you know it would be kind of fun

73
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:11,640
if maybe some people got together for like uh for like a
live viewing um a fancy valentine's party or something maybe

74
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:19,380
yeah it looks like a really snazzy place right like it's and
it's also you know it's gonna be a jazz concert so it's not

75
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:33,780
like your i guess typical idol type vtuber idol show so it's
gonna be pretty low-key return of the red dress I don't

76
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,540
know.

77
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,960
So, should I wear a suit?

78
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,640
You could totally wear a suit.

79
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,940
And it would fit, I think.

80
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,120
But, it's not so, like, no fun allowed.

81
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,300
We're obviously still allowing fun.

82
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,420
You know, don't feel like you have to be on your bestest
behavior.

83
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,040
But, you know, you could even mix to the songs if you wanted
to.

84
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,960
But they're all jazz songs, so.

85
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,020
You know, bring a date.

86
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,980
I know you're going to be playing Ace Combat next year, but
I got a question.

87
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,600
Do you know the play order for the series yet?

88
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,560
Oh, I don't know yet, Nan.

89
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,840
I haven't had a chance to think about it.

90
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,740
Now, thank you so much for the time I got it.

91
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,360
Thank you.

92
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,560
I don't know yet.

93
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,960
I'll think about it.

94
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,440
I want everyone to show up wearing eye patches.

95
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,680
Yeah, you could show up as, like, snake wearing a suit.

96
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,080
When Minto concert in Europe,

97
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
A date?

98
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,140
What date?

99
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,640
I could be your date.

100
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,680
Would you want me to be your date for the Valentine's Day?

101
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,340
Jazz concert?

102
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,050
Life and I booked flights already.

103
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,070
Oh, wait, what do you mean?

104
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,150
Hopefully we can get tickets.

105
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,770
Wait, what do you mean you've already booked your flights?

106
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,690
Basically, the tickets will be up.

107
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,890
You can pre...

108
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,690
Like...

109
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,090
You can, like, register for the announcement of the tickets.

110
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,610
There was, like, some issues.

111
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,990
Not issues, but they're, like, waiting for something for the
actual tickets to go up themselves.

112
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,330
But, I was saying how it's not, like, super serious.

113
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,550
There is some merch.

114
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,050
I don't think there's so much merch.

115
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,310
But there's one thing in particular that is.

116
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,470
It's goofy.

117
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,430
Don't tease us like that.

118
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,450
What am I teasing?

119
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,010
Can I bring my henna plushes my data?

120
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,750
Of course.

121
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,330
I will steal her.

122
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,230
But, you know.

123
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,510
For Lord and Kip, welcome back!

124
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,930
Holiday, welcome back!

125
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,790
Hellsies, hellsies!

126
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,090
But yeah, there is a streaming ticket, so...

127
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,670
together with some friends.

128
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,370
Is it goofy or spicy?

129
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,450
Yes.

130
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,410
Bye.

131
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,980
It's stupid, that's for sure.

132
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,740
It's dummy dumb.

133
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,380
Hey, Liao, Jowun, thank you so much for the vibe, good
thing.

134
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,940
Ducky, thank you so much for the vibe, good thing.

135
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,540
Thank you, guys.

136
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,680
It's time for the smooth jazz.

137
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,900
Just wanted to say, hey, mid-annihilation of Eli and his
friend.

138
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,900
Wait, what do you mean?

139
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,920
Surgery went well.

140
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,560
Oh, Brandon, I'm so happy to hear that.

141
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,120
So happy, happy.

142
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,200
Get some rest.

143
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,260
Will merch be available online?

144
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,920
Most likely.

145
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,300
I don't know, but probably.

146
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,000
Probably.

147
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,600
Probably.

148
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,560
But they have not received the confirmation.

149
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,120
Well, yeah, jazz, concert, live band, special guests, and
me.

150
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm so nervous.

151
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,680
Because live band is, like, so scary.

152
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:30,880
What?

153
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,760
Oh, gosh.

154
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,780
If I mess up, if I mess up the live band, well, they don't
stop.

155
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,920
Oh, my gosh.

156
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,460
I don't know.

157
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm so scared.

158
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm never...

159
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,420
Ah, live jazz band.

160
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,500
Oh, scary.

161
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,820
Scary.

162
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,840
I feel like, I don't know.

163
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,220
Like, obviously, with Fantastic Reality, I had a live band,
but I was able to practice with, like, the, what's it

164
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,460
called?

165
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,980
The, um, like, they recorded something for me first.

166
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,020
I don't know if they're gonna do that for me this time.

167
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm just gonna be winging it.

168
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,400
Maybe.

169
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,080
I have no idea.

170
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:23,160
to practice with like the kind of score that they were going
to use for fantastic reality of this i don't know i'm scared

171
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,580
if you mess up it's jazz that's so true

172
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:40,000
on a scale of one to ten how nervous are you like a hundred
i'm also i was scared i'm also scared that like i know it's

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,440
not during a convention or anything so i'm worried that like
it won't sell I was like I was like can I I mean I know that

174
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:59,960
there are special guests but like can I this is it's it's
kind of advertised almost like a solo show so uh I know it's

175
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,300
it's a bit of a smaller venue though so that made me feel a
bit better but um

176
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,500
oh sorry that was my controller for the game what is this on
my controller What is that?

177
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,540
It's getting dirty.

178
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,780
Lay Merry Christmas, Wiki!

179
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Hope it was a great day for you.

180
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,600
Yeah!

181
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,620
It was fine.

182
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,180
It was okay.

183
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,900
I was flying home.

184
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,380
Back to my mid-cafe.

185
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,900
And my flight got, like, delayed a couple times.

186
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,740
And so I ended up coming home much later than I thought.

187
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,620
So it's a good thing I didn't plan on streaming.

188
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,840
It's going to sell out in the first minute.

189
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,760
No, no, no, no.

190
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,500
I don't think so.

191
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,380
I don't think so.

192
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,860
Are you going to write your own jazz song?

193
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,760
I don't know.

194
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,100
Kimmy, thank you so much for the re-direct.

195
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,880
Hello, hello.

196
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,080
When will you learn that I boost show up?

197
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,280
I don't know.

198
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,660
Like I said, it's not during a...

199
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,220
event where many people you know like sometimes people will
travel for a convention or something i wouldn't expect

200
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:39,400
anybody to travel for this so so you know it's it's it makes
me nervous and i'm sorry that i just did the maid cafe in

201
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:48,820
california and now i'm doing another thing in california i'm
trying to think hold on let me think of this year there is

202
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:57,160
some more stuff in california happening that's for sure but
not only california in 2026 so

203
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:13,420
i just think california needs to stop inviting me there are
multiple people planning to travel from the east coast no no

204
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,120
that's so much though don't do that just all gathered
together on the East Coast.

205
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,000
And watch the stream.

206
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,760
I will be flying cross country.

207
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,940
Don't do that!

208
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,540
I will travel for this no matter what.

209
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:29,900
No!

210
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,240
Don't do it!

211
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,920
But, you know, I'm an East Coast...

212
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm an East Coaster as well, so I do understand.

213
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,140
I have to travel to the West Coast for it even.

214
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,700
Even I have to travel.

215
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,880
I'm so tired of flying to the West Coast.

216
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,360
I'm so tired.

217
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,240
East Coast is coming forward.

218
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:05,700
Yeah.

219
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,840
I have some things for East Coast in 2026.

220
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,300
I can think of.

221
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,940
Midwest?

222
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,300
Hmm.

223
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,680
I don't know so far.

224
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,720
Have another event in Florida.

225
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,820
Oh, I'm glad that I'm not in Florida heat anymore.

226
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh, my goodness.

227
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,080
Holiday Matsuri.

228
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,140
I definitely overpacked for it.

229
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,620
I thought I was like, oh, yeah, surely it will get chilly at
night.

230
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,360
I think there was one time that I was cold.

231
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,740
Everything else was hot, hot, hot.

232
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,380
Don't even have a passport.

233
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,040
Oh, no.

234
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,060

I was thinking that tomorrow before the Densetsu collab.

247
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,040
But just like drawn and yapping.

248
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,820
Another one of my goals is...

249
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,720
I've been saying this.

250
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,020
I want like more consistent stream schedule.

251
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,440
Where like similar times and similar days every day.

252
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,630
And then also...

253
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,440
One thing I have planned for January.

254
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,080
for January.

255
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:44,720
Oh, wait.

256
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,640
Someone's messaging me.

257
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,060
Hold on.

258
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,380
Oh, the merch will be available online.

259
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,740
I was just told.

260
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,960
Thank you.

261
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,880
Thank you, Oshispaar.

262
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:09,820
But one thing that I want to do probably towards the end of
January is I want to do a full it's not going to be, I'm not

263
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,720
calling it a don't-a-thon or anything like that because I
don't want that to be the goal of it or anything.

264
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,020
But I plan on doing a full week of 24 hours streaming for
the whole week.

265
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,020
Non-stop for one week.

266
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:36,840
So just, you know, just to kind of like catch up on the fact
that I have been so not streaming for a bit.

267
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,360
So a whole week!

268
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:38,860
Yeah!

269
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,620
24 hours.

270
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,000
So yeah!

271
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,940
Not a Donothan.

272
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,640
I almost feel like maybe I should turn off Donoth.

273
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,580
But, uh, does that mean sleeping stream?

274
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,200
It means sleeping stream.

275
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,780
Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,040
Yes, yes, yes.

277
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,780
So, um, it'll just be, it'll be pretty casual.

278
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:20,120
Just like, uh, you know, If you ever feel like coming in,
watching Minto, with whatever I'm doing, then yeah.

279
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,300
There you go.

280
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,560
Some non-stop entertainment for one week.

281
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
And then I'll sleep for a whole week.

282
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,820
No, I'm just kidding.

283
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,880
Feeding the cats.

284
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,400
24-7, let's go.

285
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,580
Almost too spooky.

286
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,500
Hi, Teggy.

287
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,340
Oh.

288
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:53,420
So, Minto-ton, yeah, because, you know, like, usually, I
guess, people on Twitch do them, like, Sabaton, or Donuton,

289
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:04,260
or whatever, but, I don't want to encourage people to, to
donate or anything like that, so I was thinking having other

290
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:16,060
stretch goals in different ways, like, I don't know, I've
been kind of, like, thinking, like, oh, if I, reach this I

291
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:27,440
don't know this many views or something non-stop meat
phantom yeah will you swap out the VOD so it isn't lost oh

292
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:40,720
good question I probably wouldn't be able to do that but
what I could do is I could say say I'm gonna be like doing a

293
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:49,320
game or something i could record that portion of the game
and then i could re-upload it um at a later time like say i

294
00:22:49,320 --> 00:23:05,540
play who knows who knows say i play something then i could
upload it later

295
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,660
Alan Wake.

296
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,140
I think I want to do games like that, though.

297
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,500
That's like a stream.

298
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,300
Like its own individual.

299
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,280
I think.

300
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,340
Is this basement cult noise jazz?

301
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,240
Oh my gosh.

302
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,520
Should I?

303
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,340
Some of you guys might not know that story.

304
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,640
Okay, so one time I was invited to a jazz show.

305
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,980
Okay, I was in Japan.

306
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,520
I did not have any really friends.

307
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,020
I did not.

308
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,700
I did not have many friends, but there was one person in my
class that I got along with.

309
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,620
He was all right.

310
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,480
Like, we didn't really hang out, but he and I would talk in
class.

311
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,480
And one time, he was just like, hey, me too.

312
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,980
I know you're into jazz.

313
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,600
And I was like, yeah, I'm into jazz.

314
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,060
I love jazz, actually.

315
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,640
Like, unironically, call me the bee.

316
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,620
Yeah.

317
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,320
The B word.

318
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,600
But I remember this story.

319
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,540
Yeah, and so I was like...

320
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,140
He was like, I'm going to a jazz show tonight.

321
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,480
It's close to...

322
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,340
It's close to the school you want to come with?

323
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,300
I was like, okay, cool.

324
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,500
And so...

325
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,900
And for anybody...

326
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:36,960
I...

327
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,340
Anybody confused?

328
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
I'm pretty sure he had a girlfriend.

329
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,800
So, and if you're like, he was totally asking you on a date,
it definitely wasn't like that.

330
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,740
And especially, I think, hold on, anyway.

331
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:02,720
So, we get there, and it's in, like, in Japan, a lot of,
like, live houses and places are downstairs, like, in a

332
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,400
basement, right?

333
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,600
So, I was not, like, I was not thinking anything of it, that
it was in a basement or anything.

334
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:24,960
into the into the teeny tiny tiny little teeny little bar
and um i got my signature at the bar one orange juice please

335
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:36,020
so i was like okay i'm ready to appreciate some jazz with my
oj and it

336
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,710

337
00:25:46,540 --> 00:26:06,660
musical instruments and and pots and pans that were being
like clanked on the wall it was just noise it was a and then

338
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,460
I was just kind of sitting there like kind of

339
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:28,020
in this moment yeah it was that kind of jazz it was I was
just taking I was like wow this is where I'm at oh my gosh

don't you know oh my gosh i need to i clearly i watched the

343
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,480
wrong la la land or something

344
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:19,020
and so and so i was like so excited and it was just such a
strange thing and I was like I was you know I kind of vibe

345
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:26,820
to anything I'm one of those people that I'll be like I
listen to anything and so you know I'm one of those I wasn't

346
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:36,820
any except country and rap no I'm just kidding um like I can
appreciate any kind of music for the most part but but then

347
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:43,400
I was like kind of vibing with everything and just taking it
all in and then the monk came out

348
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,400
and he was like

349
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:06,620
and he was like doing his ceremonial chance and it was just
like oh no no no way I'm the idiot I'm the stupid one I got

350
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:14,560
I got I'm getting sacrificed tonight the recipe called for
one spirit I don't know.

351
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,800
And I was like, no way.

352
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,060
And it was over.

353
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,720
And my friend was like, what'd you think?

354
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,180
And I was like, cool, bud.

355
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,540
And we didn't go anywhere.

356
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,520
We didn't hang out again.

357
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,660
Which is fine.

358
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,480
Was this classmate per chance interested in...

359
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,340
Roadrunner cartoons.

360
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,200
Roadrunner cartoons.

361
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,380
And that's how Minto became a spirit.

362
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,760
Maybe they were trying to exercise me.

363
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,460
Maybe he was like, hey, like he talked to them beforehand.

364
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,040
He was like, I got this ghost.

365
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,740
That's like, she just won't.

366
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,860
She just won't get it.

367
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,640
We gotta get her out of here.

368
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,300
They were like, okay, I got you.

369
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,480
I'll give her the Jazzy special.

370
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,940
for monks.

371
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,200
It is so crazy.

372
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,200
Merry Christmas, Minto.

373
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,400
I got you the gift of my first ever Super Chat.

374
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,220
Thank you!

375
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,520
Epic and thank you so much.

376
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,280
Merry Christmas!

377
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,320
It's so funny too because I can remember the club.

378
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,600
I can remember the... not the club, I guess the bar.

379
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,420
I can remember the outside of the bar and the inside of it
so well.

380
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,840
Like, it's so ingrained in my brain.

381
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,620
I want to go back.

382
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,960
Maybe I'll try and find it next time I go back to Japan.

383
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,220
Ghost Maid is too strong for jazz cult.

384
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,940
Yeah, Falafel Panda, thank you so much for that, thank you,
dude!

385
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,840
Dorigo, thank you so much!

386
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,580
Thank you.

387
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,200
Imagine if the monk started...

388
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,320
Is it scatting?

389
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,120
Scat manning.

390
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,180
I don't think the first word is correct.

391
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,180
It is.

392
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
That's what it's called.

393
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,300
That's what it's called.

394
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:43,680
Anyway, that's my jazz story when I talk about jazz.

395
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,880
And today we're playing easy delivery code.

396
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,200
Yeah, it has two meanings.

397
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:58,720
Well, obviously I knew about, like, the, I'm a scatman, and
I knew the, um, the other meme name.

398
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,300
But I didn't know if scatting was like...

399
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,700
Does it mean, buff?

400
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Good day!

401
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,520
Thank you for all the happiness you brought us this year,
and you worked so hard, super hard in this show.

402
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,460
Also, Tascado for exposed shoulders.

403
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,560
Stop, stop, I'm shy.

404
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,200
Happy birthday!

405
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,900
Happy, happy birthday.

406
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,980
Yeah, jazz show!

407
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,260
I just came back from Florida.

408
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,180
It was hot.

409
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,720
I went to Disney.

410
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,580
I went to Sea World.

411
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,740
Got to beach about holiday material.

412
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,320
I was insanely nervous.

413
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,720
No!

414
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,220
Don't ever be nervous meeting me.

415
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,440
We're so chill.

416
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,400
It's so chill.

417
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,660
Thank you for being so nice and making my first ever
meeting.

418
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,700
Thank you, Bluefish, for coming to see me!

419
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,780
Uh, oh my god.

420
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,680
I...

421
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,800
It was...

422
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,100
Disney was so crazy.

423
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,560
Um...

424
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:18,640
It was my first time going to Disney Orlando in a many, many
time long.

425
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,560
And...

426
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:30,900
I got to try some of the new rides that I was like, you know
obviously I went on dinosaur because that was my that was my

427
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:40,560
only goal actually I only went to holiday Matsuri not the
not like guesting at the con but I only went I only haunted

428
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,460
the state so that I could go ride dinosaur

429
00:32:51,190 --> 00:33:01,730
yeah I did make it we made I was like I I won't have... So
the ride closes February 2nd.

430
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,910
The ride closes February 2nd.

431
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,010
I don't have another chance to go!

432
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,590
And so I was like, I will go.

433
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:18,770
I will ride my favorite... one of my favorite rides for one
last time.

434
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:27,850
It's so... I've been sending... I've been sending, um, my
friends like...

435
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:33,050
TikToks of dinosaur and other people who are sad.

436
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,650
That are sad that the ride is closing.

437
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,910
One last ride before it went extinct.

438
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,090
I'm like so sad.

439
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,170
Did you record it to keep it forever?

440
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,190
No, other people have recorded it.

441
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,390
I just wanted to...

442
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,010
I wish I could show you.

443
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,030
I wish I could show you my picture.

444
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:07,150
So I, you know, obviously to ride rides, I have to possess a
person because otherwise, like, I'm just like floating

445
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,530
there.

446
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,510
It's not the same thing.

447
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,170
I want to experience it.

448
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,250
I want to experience the feeling of the ride.

449
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:26,050
So I have to possess a person and the face that she is
making is like...

450
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,140
It's like this, because obviously it's me, but I was just
like...

451
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,570
Like it's just this feeling, it's like this look, so you're
looking at the carnitores.

452
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,100
And I, and basically I'm like...

453
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:47,560
Just like, like this look of satisfaction and sadness just
so like...

454
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,820
Just like that, like so...

455
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,570
Oh, this is the last time I'm seeing you.

456
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,010
I think I'm gonna cry.

457
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,990
I think I'm thinking about dinosaur again and I'm gonna cry.

458
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,880
You're upstream.

459
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,660
I know!

460
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,840
Thank you for covering Bukamitaya because that was one of my
favorite games.

461
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,100
Keep up the good work, Minto!

462
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,200
Thank you!

463
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,320
It's so sad.

464
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,980
Could just adopt them.

465
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,900
But I was also sad because my favorite animatronic on the
ride was broken.

466
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,900
I was like, no!

467
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,500
Why could they...

468
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,860
Why would they get rid of it?

469
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,420
I'm so sad.

470
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,280
And I know it's...

471
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,380
What's also terrible is the ride itself is also the same
exact track as Indiana Jones.

472
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,360
So it's being rebranded into Indiana Jones.

473
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,660
But what's so funny is...

474
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:08,880
Jones so many times that like if I close if like certain
parts of dinosaur I was like oh yeah this part is that part

475
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:19,340
in Indiana Jones like a mother sending their child into the
world the mother should well I would hope a mom can see

476
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:30,820
their child again happy year and a month making thank you
thank you oh maybe you can buy one of the animatronics the

477
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,560
new place oh my gosh i want to buy the animatronic of
there's one of a dinosaur the one that's broken is my

478
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:43,760
favorite um it's a guy eating another dinosaur so basically
like starts down and then he lifts up and like the butt of

479
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,140
the other dinosaurs in his like sticking out of his mouth

480
00:36:51,760 --> 00:37:01,580
is there a fave that one dinosaur that acts like a dog no
t-rex is not on dinosaur ride which is like that's why

481
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:11,300
partially i like it because i think besides like a raptor
there's like not and a i think like a is it a teradactyl i

482
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:19,020
cannot remember but like the dinosaurs on it like you are
saving the iguanodon who thinks about the iguanodon anymore

483
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:28,040
i do because because of dinosaur the ride but it's like it's
like non-conventional dinosaurs that they include and it's

484
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,940
so nice Like, you're not getting chased by a T-Rex.

485
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,380
You're getting chased by the Karnatour.

486
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,920
Thank you, thank you.

487
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,420
Normal people.

488
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,920
Mint, this is an intervention.

489
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,640
Mint's friend.

490
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,160
Mint, this is an exorcism.

491
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,240
Iguanodons are awesome.

492
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,920
Oh no!

493
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,540
They replaced T-Rex with Karnatourus to be different from
Jurassic Park.

494
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,660
I'll be honest, I don't remember the dinosaur movie that
it's, like, based off of.

495
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:13,680
But the fact that it's, like, a Karnatourus, and he looks so
cool too oh man man but yeah I'm sorry then what else I got

496
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:21,060
to ride um cosmic rewind I've never watched the guardians of
the galaxy before and it also did kind of ruin my mood that

497
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:29,600
I had to see Chris Pratt but the ride itself was so crazy
and I was like so basically it's a roller coaster and like

498
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,100
your seat spins while you're riding it.

499
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,540
And it's really, really cool.

500
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,920
And there's like five choices of songs that are gotcha.

501
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,440
Not the crisp red.

502
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,460
Yeah, I had to see him.

503
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,840
It was terrible.

504
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,780
But there's like five songs.

505
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,360
One of them's like, people don't like that one.

506
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,620
It doesn't really suit the theme of the song.

507
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,680
But one of the songs is September.

508
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,480
And I was like, please, please, please, give me September,
give me September.

509
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,500
I want to hear September.

510
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,930
And so basically, the ride, it starts and you're facing
backwards.

511
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,530
And it launches you.

512
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,130
It launches you backwards.

513
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:25,330
And as soon as it launches us backwards, I hear...

514
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,950
Oh my God!

515
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:46,110
awesome but a little little do you remember one if it's not
a September and I was like yeah I was so it was so awesome I

516
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:54,910
got September first time I tried it let's go I feel like it
suits the ride the bestest in my opinion how did your ghost

517
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,270
form not go through the seats um well mr.

518
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:03,030
Rowland I explained earlier that I have to possess somebody
so that I can get on the rides.

519
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,710
It's all possession.

520
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,130
All I do is possess, possess, possess, possess, possess.

521
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,850
People are so easy.

522
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,470
People are so, like, you know, your mental is weak.

523
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,210
Are you guys okay?

524
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,710
Hot dog.

525
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,350
I meant after the ride.

526
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,990
This is good, isn't it?

527
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:28,690
I literally looked like, I looked like, I looked like Big
Boss when he said that.

528
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,870
So you're possessive.

529
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:35,490
Maybe.

530
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,050
I mean, you wouldn't leave me, right?

531
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:41,990
Right?

532
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,670
I mean, like, that'd be so crazy.

533
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,110
Sorry I'm yapping so much.

534
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,210
I will play the game eventually.

535
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,950
Oh, I forgot it.

536
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,290
My controller doesn't really like it.

537
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,250
I forgot.

538
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,890
Pour one out for our dinosaur, homies.

539
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,590
Yeah!

540
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,250
Thank you, Mr. Mayhem.

549
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,390
I'm ectoplasm.

550
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:43,950
The impact.

551
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:55,630
But, so the last thing that I wrote before, I think I
mentioned this on the karaoke stream, but Disney was a 16

552
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,850
hour ordeal, which was just, I goo.

553
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:17,710
It was, it was the longest, it was so, so long we were like
at this park forever and ever um that's wild i'm hey you

554
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:29,790
gotta get your money's worth you know i don't go to disney
in america like ever because it's so expensive it costs more

555
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:41,550
time than money at this point it was it's so it's
ridiculously expensive oh my gosh It's terrible, honestly.

556
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:51,230
Like, there's memes that it is cheaper to fly to Japan and
go to Disney in Japan than it is to go to Disney in the

557
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,810
States for a couple of days.

558
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,570
Happy Boxing Day, boss!

559
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,750
Happy Boxing Day, Turner!

560
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,070
Thank you so much for the pink, thank you!

561
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,470
Sounds about Roy.

562
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:06,830
And honestly, I would say Disney in Japan is way better.

563
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,790
Actually, I would even say go to Universal in Japan.

564
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,530
It's even better.

565
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,770
It's tough.

566
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,610
It's tough.

567
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,010
But, you know, I only went for dinosaur.

568
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:26,010
So I prefer Space Mountain in Disneyland Paris.

569
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,750
It's very similar to Rock and Roller Coaster.

570
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,290
Oh, really?

571
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:29,910
Wait.

572
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,870
So does it go upside down and stuff too?

573
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:39,650
Because I remember Rock and Roller Coaster has like
inversions and stuff where Space Mountain does not usually.

574
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,370
Have you ever been to Fujiqu?

575
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,770
Absolutely, I love Fujiqu!

576
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,190
I love Fujiqu.

577
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:50,010
Yeah.

578
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,190
Do you have a theme park tier list?

579
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,950
Honestly, I've been...

580
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,590
Thank you!

581
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,070
I've been wanting to do...

582
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:06,830
That's why I've kind of been going to more theme parks
recently, because I've been trying to, like...

583
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:08,090
Not...

584
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,050
I mean, like, I consider myself...

585
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:20,890
a bit of a like a theme park otaku so i've been really you
know and i watch a lot of videos and stuff but i i don't go

586
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:31,150
out so much so um i've been trying to expand in my my
everything to be like oh yeah i've been to this park and

587
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:42,890
here's my pros and cons and such so yeah do you offer What
is that?

588
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,070
Wait, offer...

589
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,840
Nasty Scrooge.

590
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,580
Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick hauntings.

591
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,340
Oh, like the ghost of Christmas past and future and present?

592
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,960
Oh!

593
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,480
I'm the ghost of Christmas stupid.

594
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,780
Ever been to Cedar Point?

595
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,180
No!

596
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,060
I want to go, though.

597
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,180
I want to go so bad.

598
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,360
Hope you can haunt Orlando again for Epic.

599
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,380
Yeah, I want to go to Epic so bad.

600
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,860
That's an idea for the Minto Thon, the theme park tier list.

601
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,020
I'm very specific about things I like, though.

602
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:43,340
I like, I don't prefer, or rather, roller coasters with,
like, a lot of loops and corkscrews.

603
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:53,880
stuff i don't really care about i like i like rides with big
drops i like the big i like i like getting good air time

604
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:00,900
hope you had a good christmas and glad to hear you feeling
better thank you thank you thank you favorite theme park

605
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,560
probably fujikyu

606
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:21,620
goliath would be a fun one for you oh i think uh i think
There's a ride at SeaWorld called, um, what was it called?

607
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,780
It's the shark one.

608
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,380
But I'm pretty sure it has the same exact track as Goliath.

609
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,340
Because I've seen, I've seen, like, videos of Goliath.

610
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,100
And I, and I'm pretty sure.

611
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,700
A Mako!

612
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mako, Mako.

613
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,880
I brought my Mickey plush to ride wide.

614
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,920
Oh, I bought my Mickey plush to wide.

615
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,820
the sueso after Hormat.

616
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,200
It's super fun.

617
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,200
I want to ride Stardust Racer so bad.

618
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,960
Oh, ain't there.

619
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,500
The last time I went to Disney was probably close to 20
years ago with a girl I was dating.

620
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,640
We got into an argument and left two hours after getting
there.

621
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:15,040
That reminds me of the last time I was the last time I went
to a theme park in when I was a wee little baby.

622
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:24,620
uh i so it's kind of strange like i did not have enough
spiritual power to possess like an adult you know so i had

623
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:39,420
to possess a kid and um i went to go ride uh this was this
was universal i went to go ride dr doom's uh drop tower you

624
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:50,040
know and i went on it and the first time uh the people I was
with, they were able to distract the person from checking my

625
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,400
height.

626
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,120
And I was like, that was so fun!

627
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,380
I'm gonna go on it again.

628
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,100
And so I went on it again, they were like, um, we need to
measure your height.

629
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,420
And I had on Healy's, you guys.

630
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,260
To give myself an extra height advantage.

631
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,820
And they checked my height the second time!

632
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,640
And they were like, nah.

633
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:27,820
You're too small i was like i i remember kicking and
screaming being so sad no this is not a hot dog moment i was

634
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:34,660
kicking and screaming so sad i couldn't ride it and my mom
was like do you want to ride spider-man one last time and i

635
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,040
was like no get me out of here

636
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:50,260
and so that was my last experience i'm i'm like healing some
childhood traumas by going back to these parks a little bit.

637
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,320
Baby Corey, thank you so much for the fun!

638
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,760

00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:47,020
And I was in a Baka Mitai tribute album by...

671
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,780
By Silver Gunner.

672
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,880
I get to do Christmas with extended folks on Sunday.

673
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,640
I have nephews actually totally banned from Seymour.

674
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:02,580
seven because their parents can't take it anymore are we
well are we delivering babies from all the eyeball pregnant

cleaned it out not too long ago

678
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,620
Welcome to Easy Call.

679
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,940
Have an easy day.

680
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,260
We're delivering packages today, everybody.

681
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,540
And it seems easy.

682
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:38,820
Nice.

683
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,400
Why do you have to clean it out?

684
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,160
Because I save everything to download.

685
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,940
Do you guys...

686
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,460
I'll save everything to download.

687
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,720
I think even files that I use on the regular are saved to
download.

688
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,980
Make a delivery, that's my goal.

689
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,310
Side goal.

690
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,480
I save everything the downloads, and then I forget to
organize it later.

691
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,100
Oh, I got another...

692
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,440
I got another delivery!

693
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,380
Easy eats.

694
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,840
Easy flowers.

695
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,780
Everything is easy.

696
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,440
How do I drive this thing?

697
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,200
Uh, wait, what's my mail?

698
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:25,960
Camera.

699
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,420
Camera.txt.

700
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,220
Change your driving view.

701
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,320
Okay.

702
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:34,280
Jobs.

703
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,220
To start working, EasyCoD delivery drivers must select and
confirm jobs using the job selection software.

704
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,260
Payment will be provided upon verification of completed
deliveries.

705
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:45,860
Congrats.

706
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,420
Congratulations.

707
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,460
We at EasyCo are pleased to inform you that you have been
hired as a valued EasyCoD delivery driver.

708
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,740
Is this a strand game?

709
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,620
That stranding looks different than I remember it.

710
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,520
What the heck?

711
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,700
A friend of mine made this game.

712
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,140
Have fun.

713
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,840
No way!

714
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,200
Thank you, Index!

715
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,040
Happy holidays, everyone.

716
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,360
Happy holidays.

717
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,260
You are now responsible for delivering important easy coal
merchandise to and from the local businesses in...

718
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,200
Interprofit sector.

719
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,640
Have an easy day!

720
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,220
How do I get out of here?

721
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,760
Wait, I think I have to select a job, right?

722
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,540
So we're going to easy eats.

723
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,620
Or...

724
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,420
Easy flowers.

725
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,020
This one pays more.

726
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,160
Pick up from easy flowers.

727
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,920
Find the lit-up storefront.

728
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:45,940
I'm driving?

729
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,660
Welcome to Mountain Town.

730
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:51,660
Uh...

731
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,680
I don't see like a...

732
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,440
Like a...

733
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:57,940
Oh!

734
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,240
Beep!

735
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:00,820
Beep!

736
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,340
Look at this!

737
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,460
I'm too cute!

738
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:11,960
Minchidi.

739
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,980
This guy has seen some things.

740
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,840
Nah, I'm Minto.

741
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:24,760
Oh, no.

742
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,580
New guy.

743
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,620
I guess you're doing the deliveries now.

744
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,340
I'm Ada.

745
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,340
I'm not talking very well these days.

746
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,640
Oh my gosh, you guys.

747
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:44,080
My mom invited a friend over yesterday and you wouldn't know
what her name is.

748
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:44,600
Eva.

749
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,300
I was like, don't tell me that.

750
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,180
Don't say your name is Eva.

751
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,700
That can't be a real person name.

752
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,780
It can't be.

753
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,240
I'm not talking very well these days.

754
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,760
Oh, pick up the payload.

755
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,340
Goodbye.

756
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,900
Nobody took my truck, right?

757
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:14,200
Okay.

758
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,840
It's so tiny.

759
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,200
Alright.

760
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,640
Check info.

761
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,780
Look for the icon.

762
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,020
Deliver the package to Upton.

763
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,100
I don't think this is a horror game.

764
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:32,660
Oh!

765
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,740
Up!

766
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,300
What do I do?

767
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:53,560
Help me!

768
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:54,780
package.

769
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,100
Oh my gosh, it really is.

770
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:57,540
Oh, geez.

771
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,200
Accidents happen.

772
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,580
Easy code value is efficiency over quality.

773
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,260
Dropping part of a package will not affect your... Oh, good.

774
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,880
However, recovering a package takes time.

775
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,480
Dropping an entire package will result in a reduced tip.

776
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,780
Have an easy day.

777
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,620
Oh, is it starting to get cold?

778
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,360
Do you see, like, my vision?

779
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,360
Oh, I see the icon.

780
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,540
There's nobody else on the street.

781
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,380
Let's get this.

782
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:35,660
Oh!

783
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,560
Boy, do you look at that.

784
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,560
Wait, do I place it here?

785
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,360
How's the audio, by the way?

786
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:44,900
A little loud?

787
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,380
Might not be able to stay out long.

788
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,100
Yeah.

789
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:50,900
Oh, get in.

790
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:51,600
Let's see.

791
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,340
What else do we got?

792
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,480
We got some goals?

793
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:54,760
Which we did.

794
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:57,820
Sss.

795
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:58,520
Yeah.

796
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,580
It's okay if some of the payload breaks.

797
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,480
I did.

798
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,540
Definitely had that happen.

799
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,520
159.

800
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,020
Oh, easy flowers again.

801
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,220
Let's do it.

802
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,830
I know where they are.

803
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,320
Okay.

804
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,780
How do I...

805
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,240
Beep.

806
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:17,880
Beep.

807
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,780
Let's check this out.

808
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,400
Oh, yeah.

809
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,060
Merry belated Christmas, Meantau.

810
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,920
Thank you.

811
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,720
Thank you so much.

812
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,040
Jerk.

813
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:37,180
Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.

814
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,120
Hey there, new guy.

815
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,980
It looks like your map is missing some data.

816
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,820
I can fix it for you, but I'll need something in return.

817
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,100
Buy me an energy drink from the vending machine over there,
and we'll call it even.

818
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,420
I heard that K trucks will soon be legal in U.S.

819
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,520
and Suzuki is going to push some new model.

820
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,040
Starting at, like, 7K?

821
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,060
It'd be so cool.

822
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,860
I heard, though, that K trucks, like, do not.

823
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,320
They don't.

824
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,800
They are not up to the standard of...

825
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,840
They will be crushed.

826
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,520
They are very tiny, as much as I would love that.

827
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,180
They are so...

828
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,000
They are so...

829
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,840
They are, like, they become an accordion.

830
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,400
Unfortunately.

831
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,840
I don't know if it'll happen.

832
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,530
Hope you had a Merry Christmas, man.

833
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:45,350
You too, John.

834
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,030
We better.

835
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,350
Welcome back.

836
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:48,190
Thank you.

837
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:51,890
What was I grabbing?

838
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,190
Greetings.

839
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,150
Nice to see you again.

840
01:01:56,390 --> 01:02:00,150
It's been a while since I've spoken to someone new.

841
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,270
Such a nice soul.

842
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,310
Okay, this time I won't break your package.

843
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,070
I promise.

844
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,150
Promise, promise, promise, promise.

845
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,250
Close.

846
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:11,030
Look at that.

847
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:12,870
Wait, where's our vending machine?

848
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,110
I wish I could move the camera around some more.

849
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,670
I can't see where the vending machine is.

850
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:19,150
And it's getting cold.

851
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,430
Give me the fire!

852
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:25,310
Give me the fire!

853
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:29,650
Over defrosting?

854
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,320
Where is it?

855
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,940
Buy an energy drink from the vending machine and bring it to
the dog.

856
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,640
You might have to take another delivery.

857
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,120
It is cozy.

858
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:51,480
This game is so cozy so...

859
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:51,580
Oh.

860
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,900

861
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,120

01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:58,680
Beep.

863
01:02:59,280 --> 01:02:59,680
Beep.

864
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,220
Beep.

865
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,080
Oh, beep.

866
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,720
Oh, uh, beep.

867
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:04,420
Beep.

868
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:05,480
Beep.

869
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,480
I wonder, though, if I can look around with this.

870
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:18,260

Oh, man.

875
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,390
That cost money.

876
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,330
Wait, can I go in here?

877
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,290
Oh, this is easy eats.

878
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,600
I'm glad no one else uses this road, for real, huh?

879
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,800
Hey, hey.

880
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,780
It wouldn't let me say hag.

881
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,000
YouTube hates hags.

882
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:16,260
Oh.

883
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,700
I just ran myself over.

884
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:19,720
Hello!

885
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:22,840
Buy me an energy drink.

886
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,740
I did, I did!

887
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,720
Wait, I did though.

888
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:38,840
I didn't get it.

889
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,300
Wait, what do you mean I didn't get it?

890
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,280
Oh, I had to take it?

891
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:42,920
Uh oh.

892
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,820
I hope nobody steals my drink.

893
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:50,630
Nobody!

894
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,410
Nobody better steal my drink!

895
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,730
I paid good money for that!

896
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,570
Grab it.

897
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:01,930
Take it.

898
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:05,870
Okay.

899
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:11,810
Wide turn.

900
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,650
Let's go.

901
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,080
Kick.

902
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,320
Huh.

903
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:21,540
Alright.

904
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:22,660
Hello.

905
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,520
Mind the gas tank.

906
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,440
I've been looking at it.

907
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:28,600
A deal is a deal.

908
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:29,500
There you go.

909
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,600
What are you fixing for me?

910
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:35,320
data.

911
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,420
Actually, keep the drink.

912
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,180
You'll need it.

913
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,180
You'll have to maintain your energy to take on heavy
deliveries.

914
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,580
The name is MK, by the way.

915
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,880
I used to do maintenance for Easy Coal.

916
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,680
You should meet me at my cabin in Snowy Peaks for a cup of
coffee.

917
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,780
It's not too far from here.

918
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,140
Just north of up the...

919
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,340
Rocket fuel.

920
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,420
L1 is inventory.

921
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,240
Oh, thank you!

922
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,720
Though, you'll need to figure out how to clear the
roadblock.

923
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,240
I think a lighter will do the trick.

924
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:09,600
A lighter Oh, we're getting a lighter.

925
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,490
What is this?

926
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:16,390
Map.

927
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:23,390
We at Easy Co-op determined that the bus delivery drivers
are those who have learned the layout of their assigned

928
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:24,150
profit sector.

929
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,910
As a result, we will not be providing any navigational aid.

930
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,130
I just started!

931
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,590
Buy a lighter from the depot.

932
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,730
You'll have to earn some more money first.

933
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:35,170
Alright.

934
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,190
Time to take on some jobs.

935
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,270
jobs.

936
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,610
Oh, $15!

937
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:42,930
$15!

938
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:45,210
$15!

939
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:45,670
$15!

940
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:45,870
$20!

941
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,430
Where are we?

942
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,390
We can do this.

943
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:52,230
Right?

944
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,310
Pick up from Easy Pizza.

945
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,200
Okay.

946
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,520
Alright.

947
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,260
Easy now.

948
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:11,800
Yeah.

949
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,020
Okay.

950
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,980
Where do I go, though?

951
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,600
It did say no Elp, huh?

952
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,700
Why don't I have a map at all?

953
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:28,960
Pizza.

954
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,160
Alright, and we might have to...

955
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,160
It's not fuel.

956
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,740
I guess so.

957
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:36,720
Yeah, it is.

958
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,160
Stop and look both ways.

959
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,460
Oops, sorry, that's the wrong...

960
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,080
I pressed go instead of stop.

961
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,280
Where am I?

962
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,300
Head to Easton.

963
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,840
Where am I?

964
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,820
If I...

965
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:06,900
I...

966
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,980
I'm an uproar.

967
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,200
I need to go downtown.

968
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,880
So this would be where?

969
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,280
Wait, let's see what the sign says.

970
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,140
Too western.

971
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,760
Too eastern.

972
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:33,980
Upton.

973
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,940
Typical everyone knows ghosts are bad drivers.

974
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,200
That's not true at all!

975
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,000
Oh, I see myself!

976
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:40,560
I see myself!

977
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,640
Oh, we just need to go down this road and we'll go to
eventually.

978
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,860
A fork.

979
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,520
Ooh, ooh.

980
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,680
Look both ways, including down.

981
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,880
Taco Thomas, are you?

982
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,100
Welcome back, thank you.

983
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,260
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the taco soup.

984
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,380
Merry Christmas, Minky.

985
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,300
I'll be at a good one.

986
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,060
You too!

987
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,220
What's this?

988
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,840
I could hear my car.

989
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,640
It's kind of cute.

990
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,400
Is this like a radio station?

991
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,580
Oh, anybody here?

992
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:34,960
What's that dude?

993
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,420
I'm getting every station now.

994
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,320
All right, all right.

995
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:42,760
Oh, and there's times.

996
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,460
I just realized it's almost five people.

997
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:50,200
Can you play Oide Masay from the radio tower?

998
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,760
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

999
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,880
Driving while haunting.

1000
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:56,740
Hey, hey, hey.

1001
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,740
That's my, that's my normal state, all right?

1002
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:03,940
Oh my god.

1003
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:04,940
Durifto!

1004
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,680
Chupacabura, chupacabu.

1005
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,580
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!

1006
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,900
Shmake, thank you!

1007
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,460
Wait, let's see where we're at.

1008
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:15,740
at.

1009
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:17,700
Oh, wait.

1010
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,260
Oh, that's my cursor.

1011
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,500
I thought that's where I was.

1012
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:20,780
Okay.

1013
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,260
We gotta keep going still, though.

1014
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,100
This is that bridge right there.

1015
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:28,880
Hit the birds.

1016
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:35,890
Deer.

1017
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:36,990
Watch for deer.

1018
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,210
So we're about, like, over here.

1019
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:40,970
Okay.

1020
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,350
We're gonna hit a west... Oh, my gosh.

1021
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,870
There's not a gas until eastern.

1022
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:45,630
That's crazy.

1023
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:47,310
Am I gonna be okay?

1024
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:47,950
Maybe.

1025
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:49,090
Maybe.

1026
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,190
Oh,

1027
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,750
the lift, the...

1028
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,090
Oh, oh, I know how to drift.

1029
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:58,830
I know how to drift.

1030
01:10:59,250 --> 01:10:59,670
Like that.

1031
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,710
We won't run out of gas!

1032
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,690
Actually, but there was no other gas station.

1033
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:07,950
What do I do?

1034
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,870
I am low on gas, but what do I do?

1035
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,730
There was no other gas station.

1036
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,150
There's only gas station here.

1037
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:21,530
In Easton.

1038
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:24,070
I have to get all the way through to get there.

1039
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,260
Where am I?

1040
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:33,340
I'm in a city.

1041
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,520
I'm somewhere.

1042
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,340
I think this is like a...

1043
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,220
Oh, we're in Weston.

1044
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:43,900
Okay.

1045
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:51,310
Your gas is almost full.

1046
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,150
It's a little arrow to the right of F.

1047
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,930
No, I definitely...

1048
01:11:56,930 --> 01:12:00,070
Wait, is it not the thing that's blinking right now?

1049
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:00,950
What is that then?

1050
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,150
The blinking one is energy.

1051
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:10,190
My energy?

1052
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,310
Oh, I just got a thing about energy.

1053
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,130
Oh, I see.

1054
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:20,770
All EasyCo drivers are expected to maintain peak operational
efficiency.

1055
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:26,010
EasyCo delivery drivers are only authorized to purchase easy
energy drinks from the official EasyCo Easy Energy vending

1056
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:26,410
machine.

1057
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:32,370
Low energy may result in lower body temperatures, so be
careful of the cold.

1058
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:33,030
Have an easy day.

1059
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:34,950
Ah, I see.

1060
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,830
Oh, also, if I press L1.

1061
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:40,810
That shows me the map.

1062
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:42,630
Okay, that's really easy then.

1063
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:43,390
Easy.

1064
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,030
Let's go get the lighter.

1065
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:51,910
Wait, I can't afford the lighter.

1066
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:52,610
Just kidding.

1067
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:53,870

Wait, but it's not used.

1086
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:15,830

1087
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:18,570

01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,300

Alright, alright.

1153

We did not offer same-day delivery, by the way.

1154
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,160
So it's fine.

1155

01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:11,880
Beep.

1164
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,120
Wait, where did my pizza go?

1165
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,160
Okay, it was...

1166
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,440
already eaten by the rats in the city.

1167
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,180
Pizza for breakfast everybody enjoys.

1168
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,800
Everybody enjoys that.

1169
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,180

01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,300
This is awesome service.

1171
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:34,540
That's... Actually, this is the exact time that they asked
for it to be delivered.

1172
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,100
They said, I need my pizza at 3 a.m.

1173
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,480
And I'm even delivering early.

1174
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,060
Oops.

1175
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,180
Sorry, I got a little, um...

1176
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,720
Beep, beep, beep.

1177
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,480
It's gone.

1178
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:53,980
Okay, I got a little... It's so icy, you guys.

1179
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,820
It's so icy!

1180
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,540
I couldn't help it.

1181
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,210
Where is it now?

1182
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:09,630
I don't know where we are.

1183
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,070
I think I have to just keep going over here.

1184
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:14,970
They said that if I lose it, it's fine.

1185
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,250
And trust me, I'm losing it.

1186
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,230
What does this one say?

1187
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:21,430
To east.

1188
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:22,970
To upton.

1189
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:28,570
Where does the road to the left go?

1190
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:32,970
Wait, is this not where I need to deliver this?

1191
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:34,770
Actually?

1192
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:42,600
No tip.

1193
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,640
Oh, I'm going backwards.

1194
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,560
Oopsie.

1195
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:47,060
Oops.

1196
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,780
I don't need to reset!

1197
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,660
I don't need to reset.

1198
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,560
Don't tell me I need to reset.

1199
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:56,740
I don't need to.

1200
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,440
I have all-wheel drive.

1201
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:17,390
Don't you know you're supposed to drive like you got a glass
of water on the dashboard in wintery conditions?

1202
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,350
I've never heard that before.

1203
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:20,930
Same day delivery pizza.

1204
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:24,210
Now I'm envisioning a dystopian future where you can't get
pizza without prime membership.

1205
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:24,750
Oh, God.

1206
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:25,610
Don't say that.

1207
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:28,050
Wait.

1208
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:29,290
I'm so confused.

1209
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,670
Do I need to go this way?

1210
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:33,210
For the pizza?

1211
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:34,770
Let's try it.

1212
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:41,920
Oh, we are close.

1213
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:42,520
We are close.

1214
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,260
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1215
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:44,880
Okay, okay.

1216
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:50,640
And it's fine.

1217
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,960
We're not losing a single thing.

1218
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,140
Yep.

1219
01:21:59,140 --> 01:21:59,580
Nice.

1220
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,340
Take that out and place that down.

1221
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:03,640
Nope.

1222
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:04,400
Nope.

1223
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:05,720
Take it.

1224
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:06,520
Take it.

1225
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,240
And place it.

1226
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,060
Uh, oh gosh, wait.

1227
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:10,920
I'm starting to get cold.

1228
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,000
Wait, place it.

1229
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,100
Ah, uh, oh, wait.

1230
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,260
Oh god, get in my car!

1231
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:19,220
Scary!

1232
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,560
I gotta warm up a little bit.

1233
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,200
Okay.

1234
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:26,500
All right.

1235
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,160
My energy is too low.

1236
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,320
Wait, no.

1237
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,800
I need to get an energy drink.

1238
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,020
Use.

1239
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:44,940
Okay.

1240
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,900
You can drink inside places.

1241
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,080
I think I have to move my car a little bit though.

1242
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:55,760
Oops.

1243
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,900
Alright, like right there.

1244
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,660
Right there.

1245
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,200
Alright.

1246
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,760
Alright, alright.

01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:08,220
Grab it.

1253
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:08,560
Grab it.

1254
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:09,980
Place it.

1255
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,000
Place it.

1256
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,140
Place it.

1257
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,100
Oh, there we go!

1258
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,160

Listen, I have an investment opportunity that'll knock your
socks off.

01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:35,370

I saw you speaking with MK the other day.

1290
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,680
MK and Seb used to be inseparable, and I hope they're doing
okay.

1291
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,940
Bit mysterious, that guy.

01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,320

01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,000

01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:56,700
These ones won't be a beer o'clock, baby.

1295
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,340
Then it's 6.30 a.m.

1296
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,200
Good morning, Minto.

1297
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:09,130
No wonder where I'm delivering these two.

1298
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:10,710
Do you think I'm invited?

1299
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:14,070
Just drive safely.

1300
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,800

1301
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,400
I think you jinxed me!

1304
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,340
Timing!

1305
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,280
You jinxed me for real!

01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:14,240
Oh wait, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that, don't
do that, don't do that.

1307
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,180
Don't forget your seatbelt!

1308
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,280
Yep.

1309
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,640
Beer and mint don't mix.

1310
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,680
I can't drink.

1311
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,580
Well, I can.

1312
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,440
I just don't.

1313
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,440
So, you know.

1314
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:27,360
Oh, right here?

1315
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,140
Wait, is it pizza?

1316
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,380
Pizza ordered beer?

1317
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,280
Recovery is one.

1318
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,440
Don't tell me that.

1319
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,180
Wait, so how much?

1320
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,680
Wait, oh, I have enough money!

1321
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,200
Okay.

1322
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,080
Should we do anymore?

1323
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:51,960
Okay.

1324
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,240
East and Weston.

1325
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:56,940
Another Easton, Upden, Easton.

1326
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,340
Weston, Upden.

1327
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,540
We could do another Easton, Weston one.

1328
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,520
Because we're in Easton right now.

1329
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,820
And we had to go to Weston anyway, so start drop.

1330
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:10,900
Pick up from Paw and show up.

1331
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:12,760
Lighter was 29?

1332
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,160
Wait.

1333
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:14,980
I thought it was...

1334
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,360
Oh, it is 29.

1335
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,140
You're right.

1336
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,820
It was 21.

1337
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:30,180
You may have observed the beautiful weather and landscapes
of Interprofit Sector.

1338
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:36,040
Just a friendly reminder that we encourage our delivery
drivers to always stay in or close to their assigned easy

1339
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:39,660
code delivery vehicle in order to maintain optimal
operational efficiency.

1340
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,340
He's 29.

1341
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,340
Wait, how much do I have?

1342
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,090
27.

1343
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,890
Oh, well, this will still get us.

1344
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,450
It'll be kind of giddy-giddy, but

1345
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:57,330
Wait, where is the pine shop?

1346
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,650
Oh, I have to make a loopy loop.

1347
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:02,670
Have an easy day.

1348
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:04,770
What's that red light over there?

1349
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:08,490
What is that?

1350
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,240
Oh, it's a tower.

1351
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:15,700
Curious.

1352
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,100
So many loops.

1353
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:19,960
Loops.

1354
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:22,740
Is it here?

1355
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,040
Oh.

1356
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,140
Yes, indeedy.

1357
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,980
Easy auto.

1358
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:33,300
Wait, do I have to fix my car?

1359
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,900
You seem familiar.

1360
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:37,940
Do I know you?

1361
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,260
I'm Cece.

1362
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,560
What's really in these deliveries?

1363
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,840
I ought to check, but that's exactly what they'd want me to
do.

1364
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,020
There's a bunch of plants.

1365
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:52,780
Cece.

1366
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:53,340
Oh.

1367
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:56,720
Look at that.

1368
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,980
Your car needs gas soon, does it?

1369
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,280
Let's see.

1370
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:05,320
Close.

1371
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:07,540
Okay, then.

1372
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:08,820
No, it doesn't.

1373
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,840
I need...

1374
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,760
Actually, I'm gonna get out.

1375
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,040
And I'm gonna have my energy drink.

1376
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,140
Low energy.

1377
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:18,720
There we go.

1378
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:20,740
Go away.

1379
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:22,500
Okay, there we go.

1380
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,360
Yeah, my body needs energy.

1381
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,760
But the fuel is pretty...

1382
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,240
Actually, it's very generous, it seems.

1383
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,620
I guess because there's...

1384
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,920
Only one place the fuel.

1385
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,400
Don't worry about it.

1386
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,100
Don't worry your pretty little head about it.

1387
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,620
It would have fallen out, no matter what I did.

1388
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,880
I could have driven, like...

1389
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,940
Like there was a baby in the back.

1390
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,500
And it would have fallen out.

1391
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,000
Oh, there.

1392
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,180
The bar is ordering everything, huh?

1393
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,740
Grab it.

1394
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:10,900
Place it.

1395
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,960
See, no recovery is needed.

1396
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:16,000
And we're...

1397
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,880
We got it!

1398
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,720
VB would not approve.

1399
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,020
What?

1400
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:25,440
Uh...

1401
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:29,860
here is the lighter, I suppose.

1402
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,660
Over yonder.

1403
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:36,800
Over

1404
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:44,620
here.

1405
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,940
Did I miss it?

1406
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,450
Over there?

1407
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:56,890
Yo, girl.

1408
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:59,750
I wish I could zoom in.

1409
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:05,550
This kind of animal crossing with a hint of Santa Hill snow.

1410
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:06,170
I don't know.

1411
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:09,870
Underwear!

1412
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:12,570
I'm actually confused.

1413
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:13,370
Where is that?

1414
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,620
I don't want to be wasting my gas.

1415
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:38,120
Maybe it's in the next town over and I just...

1416
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,420
Is it up left?

1417
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,940
Oh wait, uh, not bad.

1418
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,920
Hmm, I don't know.

1419
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,760
Is up dog.

1420
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,460
What's up dog?

1421
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,810
Maybe we're in the depot.

1422
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,490
Oh, I see.

1423
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:22,910
Wait.

1424
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:25,630
Oh, we weren't...

1425
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:27,950
Oh, that's the tunnel.

1426
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:29,670
Okay, okay, okay.

1427
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,140
Ugh.

1428
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,200
I've been having so many issues with my eyes lately, you
guys.

1429
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,260
Oh my gosh, today?

1430
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:44,740
I had my first ever ocular migraine.

1431
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,360
It was kind of wild.

1432
01:33:47,220 --> 01:34:00,100

1435
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,020
I just met you.

1436
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,800
I don't even care.

1437
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:29,360
I'm hopelessly in love with Ellie at the bakery.

1438
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,320
Oh my gosh, you know what you should do?

1439
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:42,700
You should invite her to the Mint Phantom Jazz 3D Live show
on February 13th at the Peppermint Club.

1440
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,520
It would be such a great date!

1441
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,560
But they don't even know I exist.

1442
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,540
I'll just be here.

1443
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:59,380
Talk, coffee powder, duct tape, tea bags, firewood, energy
drink.

1444
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:02,180
Wait, but where is the, uh, the lighter?

1445
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:06,240
Lighter.

1446
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:09,660
Sorry.

1447
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,980

1448
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

1449
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,460
Can I buy it, please?

1450
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,880
That will cost $29.98.

1451
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,080
Thank you.

1452
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,660
I'll just be here.

1453
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,200
All right.

1454
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:24,140
Cabin in Snowy Peaks.

1455
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,980
That is the most expensive lighter ever.

1456
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:30,220
Holy moly.

1457
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,160
Tell her to use code Boomer.

1458
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,660
So where are we going?

1459
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:46,350
Visit the cabin in Snowy Peaks.

1460
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:48,730
Try an intercity delivery on the way.

1461
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:49,850
Wow.

1462
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,290
Backseating me much.

1463
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:55,940
What was...

1464
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:56,280
Oh.

1465
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,480
Oh, cool.

1466
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,340
I was gonna say, what is cam.exe?

1467
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,420
Densetsu.exe?

1468
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,320
Wait, how do I get out of cam.exe?

1469
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,620
Uh, good lighters are expen.

1470
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:12,760
Um, wait, how do I get out of cam.exe?

1471
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:21,610
Oh, there we go.

1472
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:24,110
Oh, there we go.

1473
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:24,510
Okay.

1474
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:25,570
We're fine.

1475
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:26,250
Everything's cool.

1476
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:28,690
Let's...

1477
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:30,230
Oh, snowy peaks!

1478
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:32,110
Don't know where this is.

1479
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:35,210
One kilogram, but it's so much money.

1480
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:39,190
For how small it is.

1481
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:41,450
Let's do that one.

1482
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:42,150
Oh,

1483
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,260
I pick it up right here.

1484
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,340
Pick up from bar.

1485
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,000
Okay, easy.

1486
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,760
Yeah, there's headlights apparently.

1487
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,100
Hat dog!

1488
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,800
I've been getting ocular migraines since my teens.

1489
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,520
You have my sympathies.

1490
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,280
Just using one eye can help a little.

1491
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:05,760
Thank you.

1492
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:14,060
Yeah, it was really weird because it was like, I was like, I
couldn't read any text and everything was like fuzzy.

1493
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,260
Like a fuzzy, it was like a fuzzy ring.

1494
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,160
I was like, whoa, this is weird.

1495
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,320
The truck has no backseat.

1496
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,620
Backseating is therefore impossible.

1497
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,280
Ah, my watch.

1498
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,300
It's bar over here, right?

1499
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:30,800
Yeah.

1500
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,160
Give me an eye patch.

1501
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,980
I'm ready to cosplay.

1502
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,580
Sometimes I try to talk to the birds.

1503
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,800
They ignore me every time.

1504
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,520
Must have been personal.

1505
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,880
Are you gonna give me your delivery or...

1506
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,480
Wait, what?

1507
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,560
Oh, must... wait.

1508
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:08,770
Why does it... Like, there's an arrow over here pointing to
these.

1509
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:13,210
Wrong bar.

1510
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:16,390
Which bar is it?

1511
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:18,510
This is bar.

1512
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:20,290
Other bar.

1513
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:23,010
Where, uh, his brother's at?

1514
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,690
Is it one over here?

1515
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:49,050
You're telling me you don't already own an eye patch?

1516
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:51,910
Well, you know, just like, uh...

1517
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,930
One of professional grade.

1518
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:04,370
is all i'm saying wait is this the bar this is the bar
factory

1519
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:21,260
hello you hear me out imagine a machine could do what you're
doing but somehow worse with a larger margin of error and it

1520
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:28,660
costs decades of environmental decline where's that what's
the pit wait what's the payload.

1521
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:31,160
Just that?

1522
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,360
Oh, it's a single drink.

1523
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,580
Surely this will be fine, everybody.

1524
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:41,120
I'm gonna use my drink first.

1525
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:41,900
Oh.

1526
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,620
Hold on.

1527
01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:46,930
Imagine.

1528
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:50,110
Alright, alright, alright.

1529
01:39:51,230 --> 01:39:52,590
No sleeping on our watch.

1530
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:55,130
We are nice and bright and awake.

1531
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:57,690
It's only 6 p.m.

1532
01:39:57,770 --> 01:40:01,950
Alright, so we're going all the way to the in snowy peaks.

1533
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:03,670
There's the bakery.

1534
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:07,430
Procular migraines, I found sometimes I can leave it by
putting on sunglasses.

1535
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:11,310
Oh, I just closed my eyes and forgot about it.

1536
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:16,170
I said, no, not today, maybe.

1537
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:19,230
Reading about, apparently it's because blood...

1538
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:21,390
Well, I don't have blood, though.

1539
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:25,010
Must be different for ghosts.

1540
01:40:33,410 --> 01:40:33,930
Okay.

1541
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:45,330
crash don't crash oh my god do you see the bottle there oh
my god oh my god oh my god that's why it's such a difficult

1542
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:54,590
this is the toughest delivery any delivery person has had to
make ever i won't crash i won't crash

1543
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:08,960
not on my watch i am going really fast up these hills though
at least the beer is still It ain't cold.

1544
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:10,120
Right.

1545
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:11,880
Right.

1546
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,520
I mean, oh, why is it swinging around like that?

1547
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:18,380
You're making me nervous.

1548
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:20,540
Then slow down.

1549
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,620
I don't know how to...

1550
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:23,540
Break is not in my middle name.

1551
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:28,160
My name is Mint Go Faster Phantom.

1552
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:33,180
It's literally...

1553
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:34,460
In my DNA.

1554
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:37,980
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.

1555
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:39,860
No cup holders.

1556
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:43,360
Yeah, why didn't we put this in the front with us, actually?

1557
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,210
We made it.

1558
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:51,290
Welcome to Upton.

1559
01:41:55,050 --> 01:41:56,370
Mint floor at Phantom.

1560
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,800
It's over this way, right?

1561
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:06,520
Tunnel to snowy peaks.

1562
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1563
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:13,610
I just light this on fire?

1564
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:15,070
Yeah.

1565
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,970
Why was it sealed?

1566
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:37,770
Who did this?

1567
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:40,030
Why am I causing arson?

1568
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:44,430
Mint's metal name is Crash, not Break.

1569
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:45,450
Wait.

1570
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:46,270
No!

1571
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:51,650
I was thinking Crash Bandicoot.

1572
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:54,230
Speed freak phantom.

1573
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:00,060
I think I can go.

1574
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,480
Oh.

1575
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:06,060
think I could have gone.

1576
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:06,900
Wait.

1577
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:08,740
Uh, guys, back up.

1578
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,180
It's almost gone.

1579
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:17,780
There we go.

1580
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:23,020
On the road again.

1581
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,000
Truly the PS1 experience.

1582
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:27,060
Enter snowy peaks.

1583
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,120
What just was that?

1584
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:30,760
Ooh, it's snowy for sure.

1585
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,760
It's really chilly up in here.

1586
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,580
Ooh, they're like, watch the road, watch the road.

1587
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:39,920
If ectoplasm is not ghost blood, then what fluid is it?

1588
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:41,520
Oh my god.

1589
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:42,680
They're trying to...

1590
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,340
They're trying to...

1591
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,240
Like...

1592
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,600
Sabotage me.

1593
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,080
Um...

1594
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,020
Well, what do you consider goo?

1595
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,280
All-wheel drive, all-wheel drive?

1596
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,760
What would goo be to you?

1597
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:04,200
Wait, here?

1598
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:06,500
Or down there?

1599
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:12,840
Welcome to Snowy Peaks.

1600
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:18,420
To Muntin.

1601
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:19,200
Winton.

1602
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:20,700
Oh, here.

1603
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:24,700
Nerd laundry.

1604
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:25,560
Thank you so much, reload.

1605
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:26,040
Thank you.

1606
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,220
Thank you.

1607
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:40,510
Have an easy day.

1608
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:42,470
Can I have a coffee?

1609
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:43,490
Welcome.

1610
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:44,350
Welcome.

1611
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:48,550
It's been a while since someone else was over.

1612
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:50,510
Sorry about the mess.

1613
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:52,810
Here is promised.

1614
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:58,530
Coffee is a much better energy source than energy drinks.

1615
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:02,790
It takes some effort to prepare, but will last you a lot
longer.

1616
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:06,170
Besides, anything good in life takes a little effort.

1617
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:07,290
So true.

1618
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,990
Guys, it's MK, definitely not KK.

1619
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:13,790
You remind me of my good friend Seb.

1620
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,150
They liked coffee, too.

1621
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,690
Me, though, I'm more of a tea dog.

1622
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:21,810
I'm rambling.

1623
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:25,170
To brew your own coffee, you'll need a cooking pot.

1624
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:27,870
There's one for sale here at the depot.

1625
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:32,390
Cooking pot.

1626
01:45:33,990 --> 01:45:35,590
But you're free to use mine anytime.

1627
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:36,470
Yeah.

1628
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:41,950
Why don't you brew yourself with more coffee before you go?

1629
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:46,370
Anyways, a word of warning.

1630
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:48,730
Snowy peaks has treacherous, uneven terrain.

1631
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,070
You'll need snow tires!

1632
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:54,790
You can purchase some at Easy Auto down the road.

1633
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:57,350
Oh, that was far, though, no?

1634
01:45:59,170 --> 01:46:00,390
Good luck out there.

1635
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:02,950
Wait, that was kind of far, no?

1636
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:03,930
Wait, how do I brew?

1637
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:07,410
Cook.

1638
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:08,090
I'm cooking.

1639
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:09,830
Oh, my gosh.

1640
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:10,390
Breaking bad.

1641
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:10,910
I'm cooking.

1642
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:11,890
I'm cooking.

1643
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:12,350
I'm cooking.

1644
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:13,930
Yeah, science.

1645
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:16,770
Can I burn it?

1646
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:17,270
No.

1647
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,550
I'm drinking?

1648
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:26,190
That's the strong stuff.

1649
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:29,670
Put it away?

1650
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:33,510
Put it away?

1651
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:34,870
Okay.

1652
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:39,010
We got three things of coffee.

1653
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:42,250
Okay, awesome.

1654
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,120

Is that where we're going?

1670
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:43,420
Winton.

1671
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:49,280
It feels...

01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,660
It's very cozy and like...

1673
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,980
It's got like an uneasy vibe about it.

1674
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:56,600
Winton

1675
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:08,520

Snow tires.

01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,680

1688
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:42,520

01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,420
We're in Phantom Channel, whatever.

1691
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:51,740
Uh-oh.

1692
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,480
Yeah.

1693
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,580
I can't afford the...

1694
01:48:57,580 --> 01:48:58,760
Oh, I can't afford the tires.

1695
01:48:58,900 --> 01:48:59,200
I'm kidding.

1696
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:06,970
I didn't think I could afford them

1697
01:49:14,110 --> 01:49:15,110
Easy auto

1698
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:29,250
Hey, Seb That's not my name It's me, Reed I saw you just the
other day Wait, I'm not Seb Do we look like Seb?

1699
01:49:30,050 --> 01:49:36,250
Our little K truck is still struggling Man, I keep
forgetting things Who are you again?

1700
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:38,300
Sorry Who were you again?

1701
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:44,350
Excuse me, sir.

1702
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:47,010
Oh, we read all this.

1703
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:48,870
Oh, snow tires.

1704
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:50,150
That will cost $29.98.

1705
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:50,570
Okay.

1706
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:51,990
We are broke.

1707
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:54,550
Your upgrade will be installed right away.

1708
01:49:58,830 --> 01:49:59,350
All set.

1709
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:00,310
Awesome.

1710
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:01,330
All right.

1711
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,130
We got our goals.

1712
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:07,510
So now we have to purchase the cooking pot from the depot
when snowy peaks.

1713
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:09,790
Coffee is more cost-effective than energy drinks.

1714
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,310
I like the sound of that.

1715
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:15,090
I'll give it a few bucks.

1716
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,500
Uh, MK!

1717
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:26,580
Right on, you got yourself some snow tires.

1718
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,820
You'll have no problem driving in snowy peaks now.

1719
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,400
I'll be heading to fishing town soon.

1720
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,220
Through the tunnel in Easton.

1721
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,800
There's something I could really use your help with.

1722
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,300
They won't let me drink more monster energy.

1723
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:44,780
Probably for the best.

1724
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:46,300
Good luck out there.

1725
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,220
Fishing town, eh?

1726
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,160
Let me get a couple more bucks.

1727
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,840
Are we going to be cruising through here now?

1728
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,300
Oh my gosh, did you guys see us tackle that?

1729
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,400
That was so easy.

1730
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:05,380
Oh my gosh, I'm like so good at driving now.

1731
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,400
Let's go.

1732
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:09,900
Meow.

1733
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:14,520
Where am I going?

1734
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:16,420
Upper Lopton.

1735
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,200
Oh, I see.

1736
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:21,920
Okay.

1737
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:23,620
Upper mountain.

1738
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,060
Don't jinx it.

1739
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,100
I would never.

1740
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:30,680
Where am I going?

1741
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,380
At least our car doesn't break.

1742
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,120
I like how it says the tailgate is open.

1743
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:40,960
I have no delivery.

1744
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:41,700
We're fine.

1745
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:47,620
Look at us.

1746
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:51,460
Sick.

1747
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:52,620
Wait.

1748
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,140
Where am I?

1749
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:54,580
I?

1750
01:51:58,550 --> 01:51:59,110
pickup.

1751
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:01,890
Is it here?

1752
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:04,590
Can I go in here?

1753
01:52:05,330 --> 01:52:06,370
Looks kind of spooky, no?

1754
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:10,230
Anybody home?

1755
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:12,890
Oh, I can't go in.

1756
01:52:14,230 --> 01:52:17,350
It does indeed, it does indeed belong to somebody.

1757
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:19,870
That is not me.

1758
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:26,190
Nice, nice, didn't I?

1759
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:41,330
It's a good thing we had just in money for the for the what

01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:12,820
pretty territorial like that i don't want to be sharing a
space in all roommates and all who's living up here where

1763
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:15,440
are we picking it up from where am I

1764
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,480
here?

1765
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:30,720
no boo mates no hey mate, welcome, I'm Theo how have things
been so far looks like you're doing great the more time you

1766
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,760
spend with the locals I'm sure the more they'll like you.

1767
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:39,140
It looks...

1768
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,960
There was like a fuel area.

1769
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,880
A gas station.

1770
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:50,020
Is this 6-0?

1771
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:50,980
Oi!

1772
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:55,000
Having nothing in the world but dreary weather and trees
empties your soul.

1773
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:58,320
But maybe it's not so empty when you know a few people in
it.

1774
01:54:02,450 --> 01:54:04,270
I need my delivery.

1775
01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:07,290
Where is it?

1776
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:17,670
7-0, 8-0, 9-0, 10-0.

1777
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:19,270
I know how to count, too.

1778
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:26,390
I'm lost.

1779
01:54:31,170 --> 01:54:32,250
There's no fuel here.

1780
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:35,010
Bingo!

1781
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:36,350
Is this Neimo?

1782
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:45,030
Better graphics makes for less spooky.

1783
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:45,750
I agree.

1784
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:48,790
You're at the top of Muntin.

1785
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:56,320
I went to Muntin, not Winton!

1786
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,400
I thought I followed the signs to Winton.

1787
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:01,700
Or maybe I read wrong.

1788
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,300
Oh my gosh, wait, I just went the entirely wrong way.

1789
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:05,620
Uh-oh.

1790
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:08,080
Uh-oh.

1791
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:09,260
Wait.

1792
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,800
Oh, no.

1793
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:13,720
No!

1794
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:19,520
Here I was thinking I was making great time.

1795
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:21,100
Oh my gosh.

1796
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:25,140
Oh my gosh.

1797
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:27,180
At least I got my tires.

1798
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,460
Oh, we're fine.

1799
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,160
Everything's cool.

1800
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:37,100
This is such a drive even.

1801
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:39,000
I'm worried about our gas.

1802
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,900
But gas seems to last.

1803
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,040
Shortcut?

1804
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:50,760
We're fine.

1805
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:55,660
Company car, so I don't have to pay for it.

1806
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,940
I didn't know that the car could set on fire.

1807
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:00,840
There's all physics in this.

1808
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:03,340
Wait, am I going the right way?

1809
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:06,600
Yes.

1810
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:11,000
Fall damage, I mean.

1811
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:11,880
Not physics.

1812
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:13,200
My bad.

1813
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:14,260
Okay.

1814
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:14,940
We're okay.

1815
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:19,220
Come on.

1816
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:20,880
There we go.

1817
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:22,320
No, I don't need to reset.

1818
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,580
Who do you think I am?

1819
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:28,520
I'm Mint Never Punished Phantom.

1820
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:30,840
I can get out of anything!

1821
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:31,700
Oh.

1822
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,160
Oh.

1823
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:34,340
Yes.

1824
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:35,160
Nice.

1825
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:37,860
Someone else will need that light.

1826
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:39,880
They should fix it, probably.

1827
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:43,240
I'm going...

1828
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:45,820
That's why I'm going to Winton, because I know...

1829
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:52,080
never failton phantom never punished

Gosh, I can't stand this ghost.

1837
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:02,810
She just says the stupidest stuff all the time.

1838
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:05,070
Oh, here it is, the Uber Eats.

1839
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:07,210
The Eats.

1840
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:10,150
Hello.

1841
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:18,910

1842
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:20,970
Howdy, Whippersnapper.

1843
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:22,070
Japers.

1844
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:24,090
You look like the spitting image of Seb.

1845
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:25,990
The spitting image, I say.

1846
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:28,090
But no one listens to old toey.

1847
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,410
Don't let them work you too hard.

1848
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:32,050
Thank you.

1849
01:58:32,190 --> 01:58:33,530
Actually, I'm going to drink a coffee.

1850
01:58:37,130 --> 01:58:38,090
Alright, nice.

1851
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:38,470
Okay.

1852
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:39,670
Take that.

1853
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:40,490
Oh.

1854
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:42,630
Take that.

1855
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:46,850
And close it.

1856
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:48,750
You think we're good on fuel?

1857
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:50,970
Oh, I have no money.

1858
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:51,390
Oops.

1859
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:53,410
So we must be good on.

1860
01:58:53,570 --> 01:58:55,190
We will be good on fuel.

1861
01:58:55,850 --> 01:58:57,190

02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:21,060
Oh, to buy the cooking pot.

1876
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:24,160
At the depot.

1877
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:26,200
And meet MK.

1878
02:00:27,140 --> 02:00:27,600
Okay.

1879
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:29,720
in fishing town.

1880
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,920
Let's do like a bunch of jobs here, then.

1881
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,380
Well, these are all mountain town.

1882
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,800
Oh my god!

1883
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:38,640
Thank you for the bargain.

1884
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:39,660
Thank you!

1885
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:41,240
Holy cow!

1886
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,000
This one is...

1887
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:42,140
Oh!

1888
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:43,640
Wait, 105.

1889
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:44,960
We'll do this one.

1890
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:46,640
Because it pays a lot.

1891
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:49,100
But it's not heavy.

1892
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:51,620
Easy Depot.

1893
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:53,980
Wait, where?

1894
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,560
Where is this?

1895
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:09,100
Mountain town?

1896
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:14,780
I have to go to...

1897
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:18,280
It was just my birthday!

1898
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:24,500
Before things have been pretty bad for me lately, therefore
I ask for a moment of awkward silence, preferably with the

1899
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,140
icon town.

1900
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:27,800
Orbital of Aquaman!

1901
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:28,880
Happy birthday!

1902
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:00,960
There we go.

1903
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:02,340
I don't know where to go.

1904
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:03,200
I'm confused.

1905
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:04,160
Wait.

1906
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:09,440
Winton.

1907
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,220
Not Winton.

1908
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:14,630
We go the other way.

1909
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:27,330
This way, this way, this way, this way.

1910
02:02:31,230 --> 02:02:32,070
Here, on it.

1911
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:35,750
Mountain Town.

1912
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:37,290
It said Mountain Town, right?

1913
02:02:38,530 --> 02:02:39,470
Where am I?

1914
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:40,490
I'm so confused.

1915
02:02:42,310 --> 02:02:43,130
I'm like here?

1916
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:50,830
I guess I'll follow them.

1917
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:52,010
Mountain Jam.

1918
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,500
We're killing it.

1919
02:02:58,640 --> 02:02:59,080
Let's go.

1920
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:02,640
Easy peasy.

1921
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:07,620
Gliding like a champ.

1922
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:09,740
Where was the pickup?

1923
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:14,340
Pick up from snowy peaks.

1924
02:03:16,420 --> 02:03:16,860
Wait, what?

1925
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:17,960
But then what's this say?

1926
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:20,120
Oh.

1927
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:22,180
Back it up.

1928
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,380
Wait a second, though.

1929
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,080
Okay.

1930
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:26,900
It says...

1931
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,520
Pick up from Easy Depot.

1932
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:30,720
What is this?

1933
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:51,670
Where am I?

1934
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:52,110
Wait.

1935
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:56,790
Huh?

1936
02:03:59,460 --> 02:03:59,990
I'll

1937
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:08,200
go forward.

1938
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:14,600
I'm back in Stoey Peaks?

1939
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:16,320
Okay.

1940
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:25,670
I think I just gotta go back this way.

1941
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:30,450
I thought I just needed to keep reversing.

1942
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:32,290
Back it up.

1943
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:34,110
Back it up.

1944
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:35,950
Back it up.

1945
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:40,650
I think I need to go to...

1946
02:04:45,870 --> 02:04:46,430
When...

1947
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:47,570
Ma...

1948
02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:48,510
Eh?

1949
02:04:52,270 --> 02:04:54,790
Why can't I go down on the map?

1950
02:04:55,970 --> 02:04:58,650
So this is Winton, but I...

1951
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:04,420
The map confuses me so much.

1952
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:09,500
And then we take the tunnel over here?

1953
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,980
Have we not... have we been to Easy Depot, no?

1954
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:16,260
Or not yet?

1955
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,500
And Mint is considered one of the best VTuber drivers,
according to Homes!

1956
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:27,420
Press A on map to drag.

1957
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,220
Oh, thank you!

1958
02:05:31,580 --> 02:05:32,120
Oh, I see.

1959
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:32,680
I kind of...

1960
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:33,460
I think I get it now.

1961
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:33,720
Okay.

1962
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:37,440
I don't know why it was confusing me so much.

1963
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:41,040
Maybe because I thought I had been there already.

1964
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:44,020
But once we hit the...

1965
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:44,680
This one.

1966
02:05:44,860 --> 02:05:45,210
Okay, here.

1967
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:50,140
Oh, that's...

1968
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:50,600
There it is.

1969
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:50,860
Okay.

1970
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:58,260
We graze that?

1971
02:05:58,640 --> 02:05:59,100
Danmak?

1972
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:02,200
To

1973
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:12,020
the left!

1974
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:15,180
Take it back now, y'all.

1975
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:27,060
Suddenly, MGS2 boss music.

1976
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:35,280
Why is bar backwards?

1977
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:38,020
Easy cafe right here.

1978
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:42,060
What else could you ask for in a town?

1979
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:46,080
Easy cafe, easy bar, you don't need anything else, huh?

1980
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,260
Fantasy seeing you here.

1981
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:51,840
Myth can drive very well.

1982
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,180
Nav- I can navigate!

1983
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,760
I can, I can!

1984
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:59,060
You can deliver my package any day, if you know what I mean.

1985
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:00,120
Get it?

1986
02:07:00,260 --> 02:07:01,960
Because you're the delivery driver?

1987
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,640
Love watching you walk away.

1988
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,180
Wait, where is...

1989
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:09,440
Where's the package?

1990
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,220
Oh, Easy Depot.

1991
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:14,780
Just kidding.

1992
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:15,960
I thought it was Easy Cafe.

1993
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:22,300
I think it's up here.

1994
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,120
There it is.

1995
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:28,260
And the bakery.

1996
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,880
I spoke to Ellie for hours yesterday.

1997
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:43,740
I've never feared the future before because I had nothing to
look forward to.

1998
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:45,840
Now that I do, meow, meow.

1999
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:47,860
I'm a little friend, meow, meow.

2000
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:49,240
Are you winning, Minto?

2001
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:50,560
I just got back for my birthday dinner.

2002
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:51,340
Rico!

2003
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,600
Happy birthday!

2004
02:07:52,820 --> 02:07:53,820
Everybody's birthdays!

2005
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:55,120
Crazy!

2006
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:59,760
But I've decided that the unknown is what makes life
exciting.

2007
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:05,290
Meow meow.

2008
02:08:07,610 --> 02:08:08,110
No!

2009
02:08:08,810 --> 02:08:09,470
Get out.

2010
02:08:09,630 --> 02:08:10,110
Close it.

2011
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:11,250
Get him.

2012
02:08:11,790 --> 02:08:13,650
Wait, I kind of want to meet Ellie, though.

2013
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:22,040
I'm assuming that all the cats are the same.

2014
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:24,060
Oh.

2015
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:31,100
Who are you?

2016
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:34,460
They call me the crazy one.

2017
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:38,320
Never taken a bite out of one of those packages.

2018
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:40,180
Can't say I haven't.

2019
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:44,740
Do you think they should teach dolphins how to read?

2020
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:45,220
No.

2021
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,500
Oh my gosh, I had to explain to someone recently how crazy
dolphins actually are.

2022
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:51,480
Yeah, okay, great, good.

2023
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:55,680
What's in this tea?

2024
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:56,940
I'll try it.

2025
02:09:00,510 --> 02:09:00,990
it?

2026
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:06,960
Wait, where'd my tea go?

2027
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:11,960
Wait, where'd my... Oh, I didn't buy it, that's why.

2028
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:12,980
Huh?

2029
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:14,020
Oh, okay.

2030
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:17,420
Dolphins are cool, but evil.

2031
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:17,980
Yeah.

2032
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,320
Okay, my tea.

2033
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:36,720
Oh, it's dark out.

2034
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:41,500
Alright, we're going to... Mountain Town.

2035
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:44,720
Back it up.

2036
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:47,260
back it up.

2037
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:47,580
Back it up.

2038
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,460
Alright, nice and easy.

2039
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,520
Someone is desperate for these crates.

2040
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:54,100
No!

2041
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:09,520
Don't worry about it.

2042
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:18,540
They'll get their crates as long as we have one.

2043
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:20,320
We have them all!

2044
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:22,840
Oh my gosh, as long as we have one!

2045
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:24,700
A dolphin killed my father.

2046
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:28,240
That's why I heavily invest in all fishing industry.

2047
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:29,960
Cool.

2048
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:37,210
Dolphins are crazy though.

2049
02:10:42,070 --> 02:10:43,070
We keep losing our...

2050
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:44,430
signal.

2051
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:45,170
Okay.

2052
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:46,490
We're fine.

2053
02:10:46,650 --> 02:10:47,170
Everything's cool.

2054
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:47,950
Everything's chill.

2055
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:51,130
MGS boss lore.

2056
02:10:51,870 --> 02:10:52,930
It really is.

2057
02:11:05,650 --> 02:11:06,770
Mountain town.

2058
02:11:07,530 --> 02:11:09,410
I'm a mountain girl.

2059
02:11:10,410 --> 02:11:11,610
Wait, where is mountain town?

2060
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:12,850
It's this way, no?

2061
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:24,860
Mountain town.

2062
02:11:29,730 --> 02:11:31,730
Dolphins don't live up to human etiquette.

2063
02:11:33,210 --> 02:11:34,930
They have no moral.

2064
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:40,970
Am I going to be okay on?

2065
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:43,250
I guess we could always go to the other place.

2066
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:45,050
I get more money.

2067
02:11:47,210 --> 02:11:50,430
We don't have to go all the way to Weston.

2068
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:51,950
What is it, Weston?

2069
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:52,670
Easton.

2070
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:58,560
Oh, don't worry about it.

2071
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:02,220
Don't worry, you're pretty little head.

2072
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:03,360
Where am I going?

2073
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:07,900
Delivery at the Weston!

2074
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:08,900
Oh, where's Easton?

2075
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:11,000
Wait, Weston.

2076
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:12,000
West.

2077
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,460
West on the...

2078
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:14,580
We...

2079
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:16,040
West on the left side.

2080
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:18,880
E...

2081
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:20,980
East on the right side.

2082
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:22,560
Wee.

2083
02:12:31,330 --> 02:12:33,470
I think it's this way.

2084
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:43,600
It's the easy news.

2085
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:45,600
What are they saying?

2086
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,040
Cannibalism!

2087
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:52,560
A serial killer on the loose, lock all your doors!

2088
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:58,180
A serial killer, specifically targeting package deliverers!

2089
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:03,800
No way.

2090
02:13:04,820 --> 02:13:05,720
Couldn't be me.

2091
02:13:09,910 --> 02:13:11,030
This just in.

2092
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:16,910
Guys, after this delivery, I'm going to go get some food for
myself if that's okay.

2093
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:21,670
Was that a path that I saw on the right side of the road?

2094
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:23,230
Curious.

2095
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:27,700
Where am I?

2096
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:29,960
I think I'm heading into Weston.

2097
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,340
Yes, of course.

2098
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:33,360
Thank you.

2099
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:36,040
I got to take my medicine so I can...

2100
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:36,960
I gotta take this medicine.

2101
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:38,220
Wait, sorry, wait.

2102
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:44,840
No, I meant to say I gotta eat some food so I can take this
medicine.

2103
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:59,000
I gotta take

2104
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:05,920
this medicine so I can take this medicine.

2105
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:08,000
What's wrong with me?

2106
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,600
Why can't I speak?

2107
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:12,040
My brain!

2108
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:15,380
Okay, we're...

2109
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:16,840
We are...

2110
02:14:18,140 --> 02:14:18,540
Delivery!

2111
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:22,000
I think this would be the eastern route.

2112
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:24,000
So we can go this way.

2113
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:28,260
Hey, bro, I heard you like medicine.

2114
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:37,480
Alright, we're going downhill.

2115
02:14:37,620 --> 02:14:38,380
I'm not even on the...

2116
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:39,400
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

2117
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:41,120
Gas, gas, gas.

2118
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:42,600
That's...

2119
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:43,100
Oh, shoot.

2120
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:43,880
We do need gas.

2121
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:48,900
We need gas bad.

2122
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:50,500
Time to go to Easton.

2123
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:53,820
Grandma stuff.

2124
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:55,800
Place it down.

2125
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:57,300
Nice.

2126
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:59,100
I hope I have enough money.

2127
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:01,660
Are the meds pink too?

2128
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:05,300
Pink gonna take our meds and we disappear.

2129
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:06,900
You could never.

2130
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:08,660
I think I'm too far gone.

2131
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,920
Yeah, the package always regenerates.

2132
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:14,720
rates, luckily.

2133
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:18,000
Alright, I think this goes all straight to Easton, baby.

2134
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,980
I already like meds, so I put meds in your meds.

2135
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:22,640
Blah, blah, blah.

2136
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:26,120
Alright, get some gas, and then we'll go to Fishtown.

2137
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:29,600
Here.

2138
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:34,840
Yes.

2139
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:35,280
Shortcut.

2140
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:54,080
Fuel.

2141
02:15:56,860 --> 02:15:57,560
Oh my gosh.

2142
02:15:58,780 --> 02:15:58,960
Hmm.

2143
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:01,300
Welcome to Easy Fuel.

2144
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:14,040

even say how much I want.

2147
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:37,620
It's not up to me.

2148
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:42,340
It's not up to me, I guess.

2149
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:45,360
Let's go back down.

2150
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:47,100
Dinner time?

2151
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:47,520
Yeah.

2152
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:49,360
Once I go, shortcut.

2153
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:54,680
Easy.

2154
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:04,600
We're gonna have to take on some heavy duty jobs for the
next bit.

2155
02:17:05,660 --> 02:17:06,200
They took all...

2156
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:07,480
Oh, gas took all my money.

2157
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:09,620
I can't even afford anything.

2158
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,640
Oh, you need the snow tires to get to the tunnel.

2159
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:16,840
Probably.

2160
02:17:21,350 --> 02:17:22,630
You wanted fun?

2161
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:24,830
Here you go, Minta.

2162
02:17:25,050 --> 02:17:26,470
Thank you, little...

2163
02:17:26,470 --> 02:17:27,330
Thank you.

2164
02:17:27,610 --> 02:17:29,010
Enter Fishing Town!

2165
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:29,990
Oh.

2166
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:36,150
I'll leave you here while I go get some food.

2167
02:17:37,130 --> 02:17:41,810
You can listen to Mk's delightful orchestra.

2168
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:21,040
One second, I made some and then I was like, I think I want
more, so I'm gonna go get more.

2169
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:22,840
I'm making more, one second.

2170
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:25,380
Oh, Nimi, thank you for the bread.

2171
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:27,300
Hello, naplings.

2172
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:30,580
I'm getting some food real quick, so I'll just give you like
two seconds.

2173
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,060
I'm back, sorry about that.

2174
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:25,940
This game is so cute so far.

2175
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:28,220
Alright, let's talk to WK.

2176
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:33,120
Basically, we're making deliveries in this mysterious town.

2177
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:40,860
Apparently, this used to be a bustling fishing village
before Iziko took over the Hydro Dam.

2178
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:45,480
He blocked off the whole area for everyone, but employees
and locals.

2179
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:50,320
here besides the ones owned by Easy Coal.

2180
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:54,120
I actually need your help to infiltrate the dam!

2181
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:57,280
There's some supplies there that we'll need.

2182
02:21:58,140 --> 02:21:58,960
Sneaking mission?

2183
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:00,280
Wait.

2184
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:02,920
Are we overthrowing Easy Coal?

2185
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:13,760
WK is the only one without a job.

2186
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:22,580
He gives you coffee instead of the energy drink, which Easy
Co says that you have to drink.

2187
02:22:23,460 --> 02:22:24,920
I think he's revolting.

2188
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:29,500
I think him and Seb were going to work together, and then
they erased Seb's memories.

2189
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,860
Because he was not being a good employee.

2190
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:44,800
We'll bring him down.

2191
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:49,100
MK.

2192
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:51,660
MK, just flip it around.

2193
02:22:57,700 --> 02:22:58,840
Overthrow the company.

2194
02:22:58,860 --> 02:22:59,100
company.

2195
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:11,280
To get your truck past a security gate, you'll need to
reactivate all local radio stations.

2196
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,320
Ah, we did one!

2197
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:17,640
It seems to be a strange failsafe implemented by the Easy
Co.

2198
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:20,700
I recommend buying yourself a cooking pot while you're at
it.

2199
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,480
I'll make the trip to the other side first.

2200
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:24,940
I'll be waiting for you.

2201
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:26,800
Good luck out there.

2202
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:30,360
He misses Seb.

2203
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:35,540
Wait, what if I drop down there?

2204
02:23:37,940 --> 02:23:39,320
Oh, see, yeah, we have one of them.

2205
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:40,060
We have one of them.

2206
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:42,540
Because I just clicked it on.

2207
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:43,240
Okay, cool.

2208
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:47,900
So, find and activate the radio, and we gotta do the cooking
pot.

2209
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:51,840
Gone for 10 minutes?

2210
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:52,320
What happened?

2211
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:53,460
Not much.

2212
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:54,260
I went and got food.

2213
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:01,860
I forgot.

2214
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:07,860
Let's, uh, let's have some coffee.

2215
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:09,960
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2216
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:11,060
Dang it, dang it, dang it.

2217
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:11,740
Okay, there we go.

2218
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:15,640
Nice, okay.

2219
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:19,400
We only have one thing of coffee left, so...

2220
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:30,220
Interesting, all right.

2221
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:32,200
Where were the other radio towers then?

2222
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:35,220
Hmm.

2223
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:37,700
Where were they?

2224
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:39,640
Hmm.

2225
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:40,500
Huh.

2226
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:46,360
Let's accept a job while I'm here.

2227
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:48,160
Let's see.

2228
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:51,080
Snowy Peaks.

2229
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,720
We can do that one right here.

2230
02:24:59,350 --> 02:25:02,090
But this one looks like another single drink.

2231
02:25:07,170 --> 02:25:10,250
I guess we should also consider the length.

2232
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:14,170
Like how far away it is.

2233
02:25:15,470 --> 02:25:15,950
Whoa!

2234
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:16,890
Whoa!

2235
02:25:19,410 --> 02:25:22,250
What a hot second 64 bucks!

2236
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:25,050
That would give us enough money.

2237
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:26,290
Let's do it.

2238
02:25:26,730 --> 02:25:27,630
I haven't done any of it.

2239
02:25:27,690 --> 02:25:29,230
Oh, we have to pick it up in Weston.

2240
02:25:30,570 --> 02:25:31,090
What is this?

2241
02:25:31,130 --> 02:25:32,330
What is this one picked up at?

2242
02:25:33,390 --> 02:25:35,130
Oh, it's right here!

2243
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:37,010
Okay, let's do this one.

2244
02:25:39,110 --> 02:25:40,510
Oh, it's easy flowers!

2245
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,470
Easy, easy.

2246
02:25:41,690 --> 02:25:41,810
Okay.

2247
02:25:44,550 --> 02:25:45,510
140 kilograms?

2248
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:46,470
I know.

2249
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:47,850
It's kind of heavy.

2250
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:50,290
It would probably use up all of our strength.

2251
02:25:52,430 --> 02:25:54,470
Easy Flowers is like what, right over here?

2252
02:25:57,330 --> 02:25:58,050
I'm a liar.

2253
02:25:58,250 --> 02:25:59,070
I think it's up there.

2254
02:26:01,130 --> 02:26:02,810
We have all wheel drive.

2255
02:26:05,410 --> 02:26:06,710
AKA snow tires.

2256
02:26:09,470 --> 02:26:11,390
East didn't rate...

2257
02:26:11,390 --> 02:26:11,850
Oh.

2258
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:14,470
Oh.

2259
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:16,030
Oh.

2260
02:26:24,830 --> 02:26:25,490
Light on fire?

2261
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:26,650
Light on fire?

2262
02:26:26,750 --> 02:26:27,350
Yeah, yeah.

2263
02:26:30,350 --> 02:26:31,370
Can I stay cool here?

2264
02:26:31,570 --> 02:26:32,090
Or warm here?

2265
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:41,360
Wait, but this is kind of tricky.

2266
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:42,660
No, I have to go all the way up.

2267
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,820
But my energy is pretty good right now, so it might be good
to do it.

2268
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:49,600
You think I could drive up it?

2269
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:51,400
Can I get burned?

2270
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:51,820
No.

2271
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:56,160
But I have to get up here anyway.

2272
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:57,080
Let's try it.

2273
02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:57,860
Okay.

2274
02:26:58,380 --> 02:26:59,920
Uh, are you good?

2275
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:11,080

2278
02:27:36,660 --> 02:27:37,060
Uh-oh.

2279
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:40,620
Oh, my vision's getting a little rough, guys.

2280
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:42,900
Where's the tower?

2281
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:49,010
Oh, I'm stuck.

2282
02:27:49,230 --> 02:27:49,530
Ah!

2283
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:57,950
I haven't

2284
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:04,210
died yet before.

2285
02:28:07,450 --> 02:28:09,730
I couldn't see what was going on.

2286
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:13,490
I had to burn the logs there.

2287
02:28:13,610 --> 02:28:14,670
I couldn't tell.

2288
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:20,300
Do I keep walking?

2289
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:21,240
Oh, I do.

2290
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:25,720
I was, like, on the beach or something.

2291
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:39,280
Wait, this is kind of spooky.

2292
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:42,600
Someone's talking to me.

2293
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:47,160
Is this a horror?

2294
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:47,980
I don't...

2295
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:48,280
Oh.

2296
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:49,660
I don't know.

2297
02:28:58,020 --> 02:28:59,400
What happened to me?

2298
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:01,560
What happened to me?

2299
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:02,340
Where am I?

2300
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:06,240
We're back here.

2301
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:07,720
Oh, Kairi.

2302
02:29:14,410 --> 02:29:14,770
Huh.

2303
02:29:15,950 --> 02:29:17,150
I still have my coffee, though.

2304
02:29:18,630 --> 02:29:18,710
Interesting.

2305
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:23,520
Oh.

2306
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:27,820
You think, though, that if I have my lighter, it'll keep me
warm?

2307
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:32,940
I've got my love to keep me warm.

2308
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:58,910
on fire my heart's desire but I want to overthrow easy coal
what do I care how much it may store I've got my love to

2309
02:29:58,910 --> 02:30:10,870
keep me warm let's see if this works it doesn't seem to have
like a limit so It's not Christmas anymore.

2310
02:30:11,030 --> 02:30:11,810
It's not about Christmas.

2311
02:30:12,470 --> 02:30:13,150
It's about winter.

2312
02:30:14,290 --> 02:30:15,370
Love to keep you warm.

2313
02:30:15,610 --> 02:30:16,330
It's about winter, no?

2314
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:16,910
Oh my gosh.

2315
02:30:17,130 --> 02:30:17,510
Oh my gosh.

2316
02:30:17,710 --> 02:30:17,890
Oh my gosh.

2317
02:30:18,070 --> 02:30:18,250
Oh my gosh.

2318
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:19,530
Okay.

2319
02:30:21,580 --> 02:30:22,920
I don't want to die again.

2320
02:30:24,820 --> 02:30:26,240
Why don't I buy a sweater?

2321
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:28,000
Oh, because I have zero dollars.

2322
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:30,900
I've got no money.

2323
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:32,560
Seek shelter.

2324
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:33,240
I know, I know.

2325
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:36,200
Oh, this does actually help, though.

2326
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,360
Yeah, yeah, this is going to keep us warm, too.

2327
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nice, nice, nice.

2328
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:45,120
I'm just literally standing in it.

2329
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,320
No frostbite for me.

2330
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:50,980
Oh, it did actually help though, that's awesome.

2331
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:55,240
All right, let me through.

2332
02:30:56,820 --> 02:30:59,660
My little tozies are so warm right now.

2333
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:03,600
Husband, we spent, we are all out of money.

2334
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:06,460
No, we can't buy coat.

2335
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:08,260
Yay!

2336
02:31:13,470 --> 02:31:14,270
Turn on.

2337
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:24,960
Sorry, hold on, give me a second to eat.

2338
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:52,900
Alright.

2339
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:54,540
We got this, guys.

2340
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,260
Believe, believe, believe, believe, believe.

2341
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:00,740
Believe.

2342
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:07,240
Yes!

2343
02:32:08,860 --> 02:32:09,260
Yippee!

2344
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,500
Okay, so we go pick up from the flowers.

2345
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:15,140
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I just, like, found that flower.

2346
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:30,520
by happens like by chance it's like wait this is auto what

2347
02:32:34,480 --> 02:32:47,420

Easton I'm such a dummy dumb

2348
02:32:51,370 --> 02:32:53,270
I forgot that we were all the way over here.

2349
02:32:53,430 --> 02:32:53,650
I forgot.

2350
02:32:53,890 --> 02:32:55,450
I thought we were in Upton for some reason.

2351
02:32:57,150 --> 02:32:58,910
Okay, well, let's go to Upton then.

2352
02:33:03,990 --> 02:33:04,750
East then.

2353
02:33:05,050 --> 02:33:06,790
Maybe I am bad at directions.

2354
02:33:07,450 --> 02:33:07,930
Don't agree.

2355
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:09,130
Actually, don't respond.

2356
02:33:09,650 --> 02:33:10,370
Don't say...

2357
02:33:10,370 --> 02:33:11,090
Don't...

2358
02:33:12,110 --> 02:33:13,870
Don't say we're not.

2359
02:33:15,110 --> 02:33:17,290
That's what we've been trying to tell you.

2360
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:17,930
Don't say anything.

2361
02:33:18,950 --> 02:33:20,730
I don't stop for stop signs.

2362
02:33:23,750 --> 02:33:24,190
Don't...

2363
02:33:24,250 --> 02:33:24,890
Smile.

2364
02:33:27,850 --> 02:33:29,770
I don't want to see your smiles right now.

2365
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:33,130
Don't at me.

2366
02:33:35,290 --> 02:33:36,770
Upton, Upton.

2367
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:42,160
Is this a monster K-truck?

2368
02:33:42,680 --> 02:33:43,560
Monster truck?

2369
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:47,700
I do think it's a K-truck, though.

2370
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:51,400
You're like that at me?

2371
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:54,120
You seem so, you're so mischievous.

2372
02:33:56,440 --> 02:33:57,520
I'm trying to contact you.

2373
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:59,120
about your K-Trux extended warranty.

2374
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:00,000
I don't need it.

2375
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:02,920
I've never been in trouble in my whole afterlife.

2376
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:06,400
What's Uptown?

2377
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:11,040
Uptown girl.

2378
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:15,120
She's been living in an Uptown world.

2379
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:20,460
And she's a fantastic guy.

2380
02:34:21,360 --> 02:34:24,480
I don't know what to tell her and why.

2381
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:29,000
Wait, so there's three, right?

2382
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:29,660
Hold on.

2383
02:34:32,550 --> 02:34:35,390
So our goals, we have...

2384
02:34:39,650 --> 02:34:41,830
They might also have something to listen to.

2385
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:48,180
We don't know where the third tower is.

2386
02:34:58,830 --> 02:35:00,270
Uptown Ghost!

2387
02:35:03,450 --> 02:35:07,330
Haunting around and always doing the most.

2388
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:11,730
Going to abandoned places to scare them.

2389
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:20,270
guys how's am I saying the words right all

2390
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:44,490

2391
02:35:44,490 --> 02:35:44,950
light on.

2392
02:35:50,370 --> 02:35:56,110
It's like, right, right, right here.

2393
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:03,480
You might need the warranty.

2394
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:04,980
Good greetings.

2395
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:08,040
Have an easier day with easy predict.

2396
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:11,320
What you will buy as soon as you want it.

2397
02:36:12,040 --> 02:36:15,880
Have, sorry, I don't know what came over me.

2398
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:20,320
Oh my god, imagine have it.

2399
02:36:24,170 --> 02:36:29,910
Can't wait for the days when we have contacts and they
display ads over our eyes.

2400
02:36:43,910 --> 02:36:47,950
know to snowy peaks.

2401
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:48,350
Okay.

2402
02:36:51,070 --> 02:36:54,790
We'll just keep doing snowy peak jobs because that's where
we gotta get the coffee anyway.

2403
02:36:56,490 --> 02:37:00,830
But we also need to find the the

2404
02:37:04,180 --> 02:37:04,980
the other tower.

2405
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:09,860
If I were a radio tower, where would I be?

2406
02:37:13,580 --> 02:37:15,520
It seemed kind of mysterious.

2407
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:18,960
Over...

2408
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:19,920
Uh...

2409
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:20,980
Over by the...

2410
02:37:20,980 --> 02:37:21,960
The lake.

2411
02:37:23,500 --> 02:37:24,020
Or...

2412
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:24,800
Over...

2413
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:26,160
Over around here.

2414
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:27,460
Oh, okay.

2415
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:29,160
We're going to Muntan.

2416
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:30,680
To do the little...

2417
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:31,140
Oh, wait!

2418
02:37:32,820 --> 02:37:34,120
I think I found it!

2419
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:34,660
Who

2420
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:42,160
needs flashing in from ocular migraines when you can have
ads?

2421
02:37:45,780 --> 02:37:47,260
Wait, this is so handy.

2422
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:51,980
I think I'm gonna buy the soundtrack right after this.

2423
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:53,120
I'm not gonna lie.

2424
02:37:57,020 --> 02:38:01,520
Well, there's only a few, like, soundtracks I've bought off
of Steam.

2425
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:06,780
I think Metal Gear did not have one, if I remember
correctly.

2426
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,740
No, but the... What's it called?

2427
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:09,240
Collection did.

2428
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:10,320
The Master Collection did.

2429
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:11,660
So I have that.

2430
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:15,420
I bought the Outer Wilds one, and I think I'll get this one.

2431
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:18,760
It's, like, so good.

2432
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:24,020
Delta dropped the vinyl.

2433
02:38:24,640 --> 02:38:25,640
Yeah, I have that.

2434
02:38:35,130 --> 02:38:36,350
So from here...

2435
02:38:37,990 --> 02:38:39,390
We go this way.

2436
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:42,230
The cooking pot.

2437
02:38:43,690 --> 02:38:44,330
What was it?

2438
02:38:44,350 --> 02:38:44,930
ate a girl.

2439
02:38:45,030 --> 02:38:45,470
Oh, there we go.

2440
02:38:46,390 --> 02:38:49,170
I guess we could have... Well, I can't buy a cooking pot
anyway.

2441
02:38:49,450 --> 02:38:50,530
We gotta go this way.

2442
02:39:05,650 --> 02:39:07,810
Oh, I forgot I had a delivery.

2443
02:39:08,050 --> 02:39:08,610
Oh, my gosh.

2444
02:39:09,910 --> 02:39:11,010
I forgot I had one.

2445
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:13,870
I have to be careful.

2446
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:15,830
I can't just drive willy-nilly.

2447
02:39:16,710 --> 02:39:19,050
I don't care about my own life in the game.

2448
02:39:20,330 --> 02:39:20,730
Pizza!

2449
02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:22,410
Oh, my gosh.

2450
02:39:23,070 --> 02:39:24,150
Owl's Pizza Palace.

2451
02:39:28,610 --> 02:39:30,210
You have a record player yet?

2452
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:31,810
I don't think so.

2453
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,740
This must be.

2454
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:40,780
Snow!

2455
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:42,740
Yes, snowy peaks right at the top.

2456
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:16,100
whoops who is heavy i have low energy get me in oh shoot oh

2457
02:40:19,310 --> 02:40:19,970
Please!

2458
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:21,970
Oh!

2459
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:24,450
That was close.

2460
02:40:25,410 --> 02:40:25,730
Oh!

2461
02:40:27,630 --> 02:40:28,170
I

2462
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:38,700
don't have enough money still though.

2463
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:39,960
One

2464
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:43,390
second.

2465
02:40:43,910 --> 02:40:45,170
Now I can finally take my medicine.

2466
02:40:58,720 --> 02:40:59,900
Uh, the radio tower.

2467
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:02,240
We have to keep going.

2468
02:41:06,310 --> 02:41:10,010
Oh, that's so rude that there's these places but you can't
go inside them.

2469
02:41:13,210 --> 02:41:15,630
Where is my welcoming hospitality.

2470
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:17,890
Where is my southern hospitality?

2471
02:41:20,750 --> 02:41:20,750
Huh?

2472
02:41:22,110 --> 02:41:23,350
Where are they?

2473
02:41:26,450 --> 02:41:30,850
Not opening up their doors to those in need.

2474
02:41:32,790 --> 02:41:34,850
I'm just a starving little kitten.

2475
02:41:36,810 --> 02:41:41,570
With starving kitten in search of Discord mod.

2476
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:50,060
Ghost don't need to eat.

2477
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:53,100
They don't need to know that.

2478
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:57,940
Oh no, it's this situation again.

2479
02:41:58,620 --> 02:41:59,400
Wait, what's going on there?

2480
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:00,640
Does it say beware of bears?

2481
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:03,120
Wait, what does it say?

2482
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:08,190
Nothing.

2483
02:42:11,070 --> 02:42:12,830
Oh, you think I'll make it?

2484
02:42:15,970 --> 02:42:16,490
Oh,

2485
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:27,220
look in first-person view.

2486
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:27,960
You're so smart.

2487
02:43:03,980 --> 02:43:04,920
We're fine.

2488
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:11,200
I really don't want to go up there in the dark, but I think
we must.

2489
02:43:12,140 --> 02:43:14,200
I have higher fueled or higher, what's it called?

2490
02:43:17,540 --> 02:43:18,060
Warmth.

2491
02:43:21,860 --> 02:43:22,140
Okay.

2492
02:43:26,580 --> 02:43:27,600
Just in case rip.

2493
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:27,940
No!

2494
02:43:30,060 --> 02:43:31,240
Believe, believe!

2495
02:43:32,420 --> 02:43:33,620
Where is it though?

2496
02:43:34,620 --> 02:43:35,900
Oh my gosh, there's another staircase.

2497
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:41,640
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

2498
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:43,740
Please, please, please, please.

2499
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:45,100
I will seek shelter.

2500
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,480
I'm seeking shelter right now.

2501
02:43:48,220 --> 02:43:50,200
I'm seeking it up this staircase.

2502
02:43:51,460 --> 02:43:53,140
I'm seeking it up the staircase.

2503
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:57,900
We're so close!

2504
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:02,560
Oh my gosh, it's right there.

2505
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:03,500
Let me in, let me in.

2506
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:04,700
Yes!

2507
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:06,580
Oh!

2508
02:44:09,740 --> 02:44:10,100
Yeah!

2509
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:11,860
Baby!

2510
02:44:18,810 --> 02:44:19,170
Sorry.

2511
02:44:33,370 --> 02:44:35,830
Head to fishing town and open the security gate.

2512
02:44:36,270 --> 02:44:37,450
I gotta give me a cooking pot.

2513
02:44:38,350 --> 02:44:39,570
Wait, I don't think I have any more.

2514
02:44:39,750 --> 02:44:39,890
Wait.

2515
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:46,530
Make sure your energy isn't too low before venturing into
the cold.

2516
02:44:46,990 --> 02:44:50,730
Holding a lighter will slow down freezing but...

2517
02:44:50,730 --> 02:44:52,350
Oh my gosh, sorry my contacts.

2518
02:44:53,050 --> 02:44:54,190
Won't prevent it entirely.

2519
02:44:55,730 --> 02:44:58,210
Campfires provide a great deployable source of warmth.

2520
02:44:58,370 --> 02:45:01,150
A brewed cup of tea provides temporary immunity to freezing.

2521
02:45:01,870 --> 02:45:03,330
That's why we had the tea!

2522
02:45:04,750 --> 02:45:06,770
I see, I see.

2523
02:45:08,910 --> 02:45:09,430
My...

2524
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,750
My...

2525
02:45:10,750 --> 02:45:11,830
It could be better.

2526
02:45:12,930 --> 02:45:13,990
Blizzard out my window.

2527
02:45:14,310 --> 02:45:14,790
Blizzard in the game.

2528
02:45:14,990 --> 02:45:15,730
No escape for me.

2529
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:16,010
No!

2530
02:45:16,990 --> 02:45:17,430
Wait.

2531
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:18,190
Vider?

2532
02:45:21,270 --> 02:45:22,030
Okay, good.

2533
02:45:22,890 --> 02:45:23,570
Alright, we're running.

2534
02:45:26,050 --> 02:45:27,790
I wonder if there's anything I can lie.

2535
02:45:28,530 --> 02:45:29,030
You know?

2536
02:45:29,850 --> 02:45:30,630
Oh my gosh.

2537
02:45:31,210 --> 02:45:31,990
I don't want to die.

2538
02:45:32,650 --> 02:45:33,750
I don't want to die.

2539
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:35,550
I don't want to die.

2540
02:45:37,430 --> 02:45:38,910
Is this like something I can lie?

2541
02:45:39,110 --> 02:45:40,510
I can't set arson to the tree?

2542
02:45:41,190 --> 02:45:41,590
Okay.

2543
02:45:41,830 --> 02:45:42,890
Seek shelter.

2544
02:45:43,310 --> 02:45:44,090
Oh, God, already!

2545
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:46,570
Get down there!

2546
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:56,260
Oh, it felt so...

2547
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:58,400
It felt like it took so long.

2548
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:01,440
Going up, then it did going down.

2549
02:46:07,270 --> 02:46:07,870
Yippee!

2550
02:46:11,130 --> 02:46:12,550
We're too good, guys.

2551
02:46:12,670 --> 02:46:13,230
We're too good.

2552
02:46:15,990 --> 02:46:16,250
Oh.

2553
02:46:18,190 --> 02:46:19,830
Let's see if there's, like, a...

2554
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:23,210
job up here before I go anywhere else.

2555
02:46:24,990 --> 02:46:26,690
This is, I need more money.

2556
02:46:27,870 --> 02:46:28,470
Fishing town.

2557
02:46:31,070 --> 02:46:32,670
Just got here, but I hope you had a good holiday.

2558
02:46:33,770 --> 02:46:35,130
You too, Gundam Wing.

2559
02:46:35,310 --> 02:46:36,090
Thank you.

2560
02:46:40,970 --> 02:46:41,970
Mountain town.

2561
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:45,110
I guess we go back to Mountain town?

2562
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:53,900
Let's try local.

2563
02:46:59,690 --> 02:47:00,210
Lopton.

2564
02:47:00,770 --> 02:47:02,290
Wait, Muntin to Wintin.

2565
02:47:02,350 --> 02:47:03,050
We could do that one.

2566
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:09,660
We have to go back to Monday anyway.

2567
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:13,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2568
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:13,740
Let's do this one.

2569
02:47:13,880 --> 02:47:14,400
Let's do this one.

2570
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:17,320
And then we could get the cooking pot, I think.

2571
02:47:22,290 --> 02:47:22,830
Easy, ma!

2572
02:47:26,450 --> 02:47:27,370
Hope you're good.

2573
02:47:27,950 --> 02:47:28,390
Kimmish.

2574
02:47:29,070 --> 02:47:29,590
You too!

2575
02:47:30,110 --> 02:47:31,390
Weezy, thank you.

2576
02:47:31,570 --> 02:47:32,730
You too, you too, you too.

2577
02:47:34,010 --> 02:47:34,750
Let her cook.

2578
02:47:34,810 --> 02:47:35,750
We're cooking, we're cooking.

2579
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:37,890
We are cooking.

2580
02:47:39,270 --> 02:47:41,930
I don't think the intercity ones are worth it right now.

2581
02:47:42,550 --> 02:47:45,350
Or they might be, but...

2582
02:47:45,350 --> 02:47:48,270
If we're just staying in this area anyway...

2583
02:47:48,270 --> 02:47:48,970
Might be better.

2584
02:47:52,740 --> 02:47:54,180
And across the bridge!

2585
02:47:58,120 --> 02:47:59,220
That was a turn.

2586
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:00,480
I need to stop looking at chat.

2587
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:05,680
Stop reading chat and pay attention to the road.

2588
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:08,240
Chowderful, welcome to Mambuship Day.

2589
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:09,780
Ooh, this way.

2590
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:19,200
Okay.

2591
02:48:20,580 --> 02:48:21,920
Do not look.

2592
02:48:22,780 --> 02:48:23,380
I'm looking.

2593
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:24,020
I'm looking.

2594
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:25,820
I'm looking at all your pretty faces.

2595
02:48:26,940 --> 02:48:28,320
How could I not look?

2596
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:31,660
I've missed you guys.

2597
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:33,400
Wait.

2598
02:48:35,240 --> 02:48:37,540
When I don't stream for so long.

2599
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:43,950
Wait, where was the bridge?

2600
02:48:44,350 --> 02:48:44,870
Did I miss it?

2601
02:48:44,890 --> 02:48:45,230
Oh, okay.

2602
02:48:45,310 --> 02:48:45,730
Just kidding.

2603
02:48:46,350 --> 02:48:47,110
Wee-roop.

2604
02:48:48,470 --> 02:48:49,870
Guys, I'll let you know in advance.

2605
02:48:50,110 --> 02:48:52,110
I don't really have so much plans.

2606
02:48:52,130 --> 02:48:54,870
for New Year's.

2607
02:48:54,870 --> 02:48:55,670
I hope that's okay.

2608
02:48:56,770 --> 02:48:59,790
I've been so busy with planning everything else.

2609
02:49:00,630 --> 02:49:01,930
I suddenly was like, wait a second.

2610
02:49:02,310 --> 02:49:02,470
Oh!

2611
02:49:03,630 --> 02:49:04,550
Where am I going?

2612
02:49:05,410 --> 02:49:05,850
Mountain.

2613
02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:10,070
It's kind of going to be a little chill.

2614
02:49:12,650 --> 02:49:13,270
I hope that's okay.

2615
02:49:13,370 --> 02:49:17,050
I'm sure a bunch of other people are doing things.

2616
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:23,870
And I will, I actually will have two, well, I won't be

2624
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:46,920

Take it.

2632
02:51:14,500 --> 02:51:15,340
Please, take it.

2633
02:51:15,660 --> 02:51:16,160
Take it.

2634
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:20,300
Wait, oh, shoot.

2635
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:20,940
Energy drink.

2636
02:51:21,060 --> 02:51:21,540
Drink it.

2637
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:22,620
Drink it.

2638
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:25,290
Aha!

2639
02:51:25,730 --> 02:51:26,430
Wait, did I get it?

2640
02:51:26,510 --> 02:51:27,190
No!

2641
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:36,220
I'm back here.

2642
02:51:50,620 --> 02:51:52,740
This part's spooky, I don't like it.

2643
02:52:00,890 --> 02:52:01,700
The beaches?

2644
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:07,920
I'm back!

2645
02:52:09,060 --> 02:52:10,860
Did I get to drink it?

2646
02:52:13,890 --> 02:52:15,530
I guess I did.

2647
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:32,200
All right, that should be good then.

2648
02:52:36,930 --> 02:52:38,690
Is there an area like that under the main cabin?

2649
02:52:38,870 --> 02:52:39,610
Now why?

2650
02:52:41,490 --> 02:52:42,910
Why would I have that?

2651
02:52:43,730 --> 02:52:44,850
That would be ridiculous.

2652
02:52:46,890 --> 02:52:49,530
Pretty sure you can recycle the empty cans for cash.

2653
02:52:50,350 --> 02:52:51,130
No kidding!

2654
02:52:58,440 --> 02:52:59,340
For fun?

2655
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:03,620
We have the room where the girls whisper into your ear.

2656
02:53:06,700 --> 02:53:10,120
mid, ghost mid, girl ASMR.

2657
02:53:16,870 --> 02:53:17,850
Where am I going to?

2658
02:53:22,490 --> 02:53:25,450
Oh, I'm delivering it up here!

2659
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:27,510
I thought I was delivering it to Winton!

2660
02:53:28,910 --> 02:53:29,970
Wait, now I'm confused.

2661
02:53:30,770 --> 02:53:32,510
It totally said Winton, did it not?

2662
02:53:37,570 --> 02:53:38,230
Huh.

2663
02:53:39,310 --> 02:53:40,370
That's weird.

2664
02:53:42,130 --> 02:53:42,610
Hmm.

2665
02:53:46,790 --> 02:53:48,030
Why did it change?

2666
02:53:51,290 --> 02:53:52,450
I'm hungry.

2667
02:53:52,670 --> 02:53:53,630
Can we stop for Nuggies?

2668
02:53:54,070 --> 02:53:55,870
No stop in this car!

2669
02:53:58,050 --> 02:54:00,050
This is express delivery.

2670
02:54:01,810 --> 02:54:03,130
This ain't your...

2671
02:54:03,130 --> 02:54:05,050
This ain't your Blamazons.

2672
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:07,430
This is Easy Co.

2673
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:15,640
I have to use the bathroom.

2674
02:54:15,860 --> 02:54:16,800
There's a cup bath.

2675
02:54:16,880 --> 02:54:18,760
I have five empty cans.

2676
02:54:24,010 --> 02:54:25,290
It's like in the middle.

2677
02:54:33,420 --> 02:54:34,280
Right here.

2678
02:54:35,820 --> 02:54:36,080
Here?

2679
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:38,380
No.

2680
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:40,100
Not the pink house.

2681
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:41,300
Abort.

2682
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:41,800
Abort.

2683
02:54:54,180 --> 02:54:54,520
Nice.

2684
02:54:55,940 --> 02:54:58,480
Nothing was even spilled even a little bit.

2685
02:55:05,570 --> 02:55:05,930
Seb.

2686
02:55:06,610 --> 02:55:08,590
Seb would have stopped for Nuggies.

2687
02:55:08,810 --> 02:55:11,970
Don't bring up that man's name in my presence.

2688
02:55:14,090 --> 02:55:14,630
Merry Christmas!

2689
02:55:15,250 --> 02:55:16,110
Wicked Wint!

2690
02:55:17,850 --> 02:55:18,590
Try it!

2691
02:55:18,590 --> 02:55:19,230
Thank you!

2692
02:55:19,490 --> 02:55:20,050
Merry Christmas!

2693
02:55:21,490 --> 02:55:22,810
Alright, let's see.

2694
02:55:23,830 --> 02:55:24,890
I turn around.

2695
02:55:28,710 --> 02:55:29,990
We'll just go the other way.

2696
02:55:30,210 --> 02:55:31,570
Actually, do you think I could go up?

2697
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:33,610
I think I can go this way?

2698
02:55:36,050 --> 02:55:37,550
We have all-wheel drive.

2699
02:55:42,820 --> 02:55:43,440
Just kidding.

2700
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:46,520
Oh, just kidding.

2701
02:55:47,240 --> 02:55:47,660
We're fine.

2702
02:55:48,660 --> 02:55:49,780
Let's go back this way.

2703
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:56,720
Now, I thought all-wheel drive was supposed to handle any
tough terrain.

2704
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:00,560
It's in the name.

2705
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:01,880
All-wheel.

2706
02:56:05,960 --> 02:56:07,320
Keep going.

2707
02:56:07,780 --> 02:56:08,320
Keep going.

2708
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:09,260
Keep going.

2709
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:17,480
I think four-wheel drive is better.

2710
02:56:18,860 --> 02:56:20,240
Four wheel, five wheel.

2711
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:21,580
Wait, where am I?

2712
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:23,860
Where am I supposed to get this thing?

2713
02:56:28,030 --> 02:56:28,550
Uh...

2714
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:30,410
The depot in snowy peaks.

2715
02:56:34,430 --> 02:56:35,090
Maybe further.

2716
02:56:36,210 --> 02:56:37,590
I think I just did this earlier.

2717
02:56:37,830 --> 02:56:38,310
Yes, I did.

2718
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:45,260
Collision?

2719
02:56:46,040 --> 02:56:46,240
Oops.

2720
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:48,160
No, please!

2721
02:56:48,980 --> 02:56:50,460
Why are you like this to me?

2722
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:54,760
Why not eight wheel?

2723
02:56:55,020 --> 02:56:56,200
Ten wheel drive.

2724
02:56:57,220 --> 02:56:59,540
Oh, please, I'm worried about Ellie.

2725
02:57:00,140 --> 02:57:01,660
Could you try to go check on them?

2726
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:07,580
When I try to leave this spot, I free SD49 errors up.

2727
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:09,340
I'll just be here.

2728
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:11,660
Third wheel drive is most socially awkward.

2729
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:14,180
Is that like a third?

2730
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:17,180
Oh my gosh, a third wheel.

2731
02:57:23,440 --> 02:57:25,320
You're hitting Mike Tyson's ass!

2732
02:57:25,580 --> 02:57:26,260
Thank you!

2733
02:57:28,060 --> 02:57:30,480
I've been really enjoying Night of the Chubakabra!

2734
02:57:31,240 --> 02:57:31,800
Thank you!

2735
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:33,920
Thank you so much.

2736
02:57:35,280 --> 02:57:36,180
No, everyone, welcome back.

2737
02:57:36,480 --> 02:57:36,900
Thank you.

2738
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:41,300
Let's go check up on Ellie.

2739
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:43,660
We can make it, right?

2740
02:57:51,610 --> 02:57:52,010
Huh?

2741
02:57:53,390 --> 02:57:55,590
Have you spoken to Fortino, that sad guy recently?

2742
02:57:56,430 --> 02:57:58,890
Every time I see them, they run away and hide.

2743
02:58:00,330 --> 02:58:01,330
Yeah, okay, great, good.

2744
02:58:06,100 --> 02:58:07,400
I think Ellie's fine.

2745
02:58:12,170 --> 02:58:27,010
all right let's get our coffee maker do I have to buy the
coffee too I'll just be here cooking oh I got an email about

Bad!

Oh, I own this store now.

2755
02:59:38,890 --> 02:59:41,070
I mean, I could buy an energy drink.

2756
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:41,930
What do I have in here?

2757
02:59:43,190 --> 02:59:44,230
Nothing much.

2758
02:59:44,810 --> 02:59:46,310
We could do one other job.

2759
02:59:47,210 --> 02:59:48,670
Let's pick another job.

2760
02:59:54,460 --> 02:59:54,840
Job.

2761
02:59:56,700 --> 02:59:57,460
And local.

2762
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:01,580
Give me the big bucks.

2763
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:06,740
Winton to Muntin.

2764
03:00:08,640 --> 03:00:10,060
Sounds like a job for me.

2765
03:00:12,700 --> 03:00:13,960
Pick up at the Winton.

2766
03:00:15,560 --> 03:00:15,680
See?

2767
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:16,880
Yeah, okay.

2768
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:18,160
Delivery in the Muntin.

2769
03:00:19,560 --> 03:00:19,780
Alright.

2770
03:00:20,300 --> 03:00:21,900
That's a big enough bucks for me.

2771
03:00:22,500 --> 03:00:23,120
Start the job.

2772
03:00:24,100 --> 03:00:24,860
Easy flowers.

2773
03:00:25,080 --> 03:00:25,240
Okay.

2774
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:39,760
Luckily I have enough money for a drink if I need it.

2775
03:00:40,560 --> 03:00:42,000
Wait, shortcut.

2776
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:51,000
Actually, I'm lost.

2777
03:00:58,880 --> 03:00:59,500
Off-roading?

2778
03:00:59,880 --> 03:01:00,340
Yeah, baby.

2779
03:01:00,780 --> 03:01:01,600
I think it's over here.

2780
03:01:02,340 --> 03:01:02,640
Yes.

2781
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:05,360
Yes, baby.

2782
03:01:08,680 --> 03:01:10,380
Solid boot cat tune.

2783
03:01:10,940 --> 03:01:13,620
Puts and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and
boots and cats.

2784
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:17,580
I'm gonna need to get more gas soon, too.

2785
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:19,420
Oh, wait.

2786
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:20,800
Okay, we go to Winton.

2787
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:23,060
Pick up in Winton, everybody.

2788
03:01:23,820 --> 03:01:24,660
Remember that.

2789
03:01:28,040 --> 03:01:31,580
I might actually have to get gas with the amount that I
have.

2790
03:01:33,400 --> 03:01:36,040
Wait, do you think I can use...

2791
03:01:36,040 --> 03:01:36,540
Oh, wait.

2792
03:01:37,980 --> 03:01:41,580
Okay, well, we don't have to buy the fire.

2793
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:43,620
Because there's a storm.

2794
03:01:43,640 --> 03:01:45,380
I just dove in this cabin up here.

2795
03:01:58,170 --> 03:02:00,010
I really get to watch live due to time zones.

2796
03:02:00,610 --> 03:02:01,790
So it's nice to be able to catch a stream.

2797
03:02:01,930 --> 03:02:03,170
Happy holidays in the UK!

2798
03:02:04,290 --> 03:02:05,170
Thank you!

2799
03:02:05,930 --> 03:02:07,030
Thank you, thank you!

2800
03:02:09,210 --> 03:02:10,090
Happy holidays!

2801
03:02:15,820 --> 03:02:16,960
Can I not cook?

2802
03:02:18,440 --> 03:02:19,720
Please let me cook.

2803
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:28,360
Please!

2804
03:02:30,620 --> 03:02:31,760
Let her cook.

2805
03:02:34,980 --> 03:02:40,200
The cat knows I'm about to do Breaking Bad in their house.

2806
03:02:41,740 --> 03:02:42,420
Oh, wait, the dog.

2807
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:43,240
My bad.

2808
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:44,960
This is WK.

2809
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:45,480
Oh, no.

2810
03:02:45,780 --> 03:02:45,940
Sorry.

2811
03:02:46,140 --> 03:02:46,400
MK.

2812
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:47,140
Oh, my God.

2813
03:02:48,120 --> 03:02:48,520
M.M.

2814
03:02:48,680 --> 03:02:49,240
Mautomorable.

2815
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:50,160
Flip it around.

2816
03:02:51,540 --> 03:02:52,660
Wicked witch.

2817
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:55,620
Wee!

2818
03:02:59,300 --> 03:03:01,680
I've literally flipped it around in my brain.

2819
03:03:07,620 --> 03:03:16,920
do you think actual drug dealers talk about breaking bad i
bet probably no i feel like if i were a drug dealer i'd be

2820
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:22,860
like yo it's from the flowers right gotta

2821
03:03:29,220 --> 03:03:36,660
catch up on some vibes but i'm excited to see the off collab
and see all my girlies no me me me so cute yeah another fun

2822
03:03:36,660 --> 03:03:40,000
year i mean I think he's a boy.

2823
03:03:40,620 --> 03:03:42,440
Me, me, me, me.

2824
03:03:43,380 --> 03:03:44,100
Good greetings.

2825
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:47,460
I met new friends yesterday at the coffee shop.

2826
03:03:48,140 --> 03:03:50,060
There's so accepting of me.

2827
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:51,940
Me, me, you gotta cook.

2828
03:03:52,340 --> 03:03:53,320
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

2829
03:03:54,100 --> 03:03:56,080
As a drug seller, it rarely comes up.

2830
03:03:56,500 --> 03:03:58,280
No, but back in the heyday, it had to be.

2831
03:04:02,050 --> 03:04:07,190
My dad knew a former meth addict and asked him about
Breaking Bad and the guy said the show was too glamorous.

2832
03:04:08,070 --> 03:04:08,550
Glamorous?

2833
03:04:13,810 --> 03:04:14,450
glamorous

2834
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:23,550
maybe from all the money you make I mean it's Hollywood they
gotta you know

2835
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:39,280
meth cooking is hard it's rough yeah but that's why it was
so good for him for Walter White because he is the chemistry

2836
03:04:39,280 --> 03:04:50,620
tensile so of course Jesse's teeth were too oh my god you
bringing that up is so funny because literally as i was

2837
03:04:50,620 --> 03:04:57,820
watching an episode today i was like man jesse has really
nice teeth like it's so it's kind of taking me out his teeth

2838
03:04:57,820 --> 03:05:03,980
were way too nice i totally thought that we need to cook and
spread christmas joy

2839
03:05:07,120 --> 03:05:14,840
when i was on the tron ride there was one thing that was so
funny about it is so basically the tron ride is you're about

2840
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:26,400
to do the race and the evil guy is just like i have come and
i have taken over the system except the way he says it is so

2841
03:05:26,400 --> 03:05:38,760
like i have to say it like that he comes in and he's just
like spread my code and you're like on the ride and he's

2842
03:05:38,760 --> 03:05:43,200
like keep spreading and you're like oh why

2843
03:05:46,840 --> 03:05:48,340
Spread my code.

2844
03:05:51,320 --> 03:05:52,800
At the end.

2845
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:53,460
At the end.

2846
03:05:54,220 --> 03:05:56,300
At the end when you beat him, he's just like, no.

2847
03:05:57,780 --> 03:06:00,460
Which is pretty funny, but...

2848
03:06:00,460 --> 03:06:02,340
I was like, why is he saying it like that?

2849
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:05,180
Spread my code.

2850
03:06:15,410 --> 03:06:17,310
He's gonna try on all over.

2851
03:06:18,010 --> 03:06:19,570
Spread that code everywhere.

2852
03:06:19,850 --> 03:06:21,810
I was just like...

2853
03:06:23,050 --> 03:06:24,010
You should...

2854
03:06:24,070 --> 03:06:27,230
It's at the very beginning of the ride if you ever look up
like a...

2855
03:06:27,230 --> 03:06:28,690
Like a... what's it called?

2856
03:06:28,890 --> 03:06:29,370
Like a...

2857
03:06:31,850 --> 03:06:32,370
Ride...

2858
03:06:32,370 --> 03:06:32,750
View...

2859
03:06:32,750 --> 03:06:34,210
Like first person view or something.

2860
03:06:35,350 --> 03:06:36,550
It's so funny.

2861
03:06:38,130 --> 03:06:39,450
I've taken over the grid.

2862
03:06:40,590 --> 03:06:42,150
You must spread my code.

2863
03:06:43,170 --> 03:06:43,690
No!

2864
03:06:44,450 --> 03:06:45,770
Don't tell me that!

2865
03:06:46,670 --> 03:06:47,990
Don't tell me to do that!

2866
03:06:48,630 --> 03:06:49,970
Like why is he so...

2867
03:06:53,170 --> 03:06:54,050
Hello, Mito.

2868
03:06:54,070 --> 03:06:55,550
Good evening, good evening!

2869
03:06:59,300 --> 03:07:01,560
Because you wouldn't complete the ritual.

2870
03:07:01,900 --> 03:07:02,960
No, the gods!

2871
03:07:03,740 --> 03:07:05,880
So many new friends!

2872
03:07:06,980 --> 03:07:07,720
I'll take that.

2873
03:07:07,880 --> 03:07:08,560
Thank you very much.

2874
03:07:10,100 --> 03:07:10,720
Place.

2875
03:07:12,040 --> 03:07:12,040
Close.

2876
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:12,980
Oh!

2877
03:07:13,340 --> 03:07:13,340
Whoa!

2878
03:07:14,880 --> 03:07:17,220
My car was haunted for a second.

2879
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:22,520
I think I can get gas from this.

2880
03:07:22,600 --> 03:07:23,260
Let's do that.

2881
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:24,780
Oh.

2882
03:07:25,360 --> 03:07:26,020
Let me in.

2883
03:07:27,760 --> 03:07:36,360
spooky whatever they're paying you i'll pay you slightly
less to go away that'll be 40 you don't have enough funds

2884
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:39,600
okay take my money and take my money

2885
03:07:42,900 --> 03:07:52,460
okay we're this is true gosh i know this life way too much
where you're just like okay we're right under half we're

2886
03:07:52,460 --> 03:07:56,180

2887
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:21,620
maybe I wonder oh wait we were gonna do this job and then we
were gonna get coffee I remember

2888
03:08:25,160 --> 03:08:29,980
I think I'll be able to buy two things of coffee so that'll
be good we can have four cups

2889
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:36,400
Monty.

2890
03:08:39,540 --> 03:08:40,300
Coffee pot.

2891
03:08:40,480 --> 03:08:42,440
We already bought the coffee pot, luckily.

2892
03:08:43,020 --> 03:08:45,080
So that big cost is out of the way.

2893
03:08:46,340 --> 03:08:48,100
We just gotta buy the coffee itself.

2894
03:08:54,550 --> 03:08:54,930
Alright.

2895
03:08:55,950 --> 03:08:57,630
Okay, we just keep following the road.

2896
03:09:02,410 --> 03:09:04,910
I'm gonna have coffee all in my shorts.

2897
03:09:05,890 --> 03:09:06,290
You know?

2898
03:09:09,310 --> 03:09:19,890
I'll be pouring him in my pockets and then just like sucking
my pockets to get any ounce of coffee they'll be sopping wet

2899
03:09:19,890 --> 03:09:24,590
you know I just like twist it into my mouth you know what I
mean

2900
03:09:28,060 --> 03:09:39,700
I'm sucking my pockets like the fabric of my pockets but why
because I'm storing the coffee in my How else would you do

2901
03:09:39,700 --> 03:09:40,140
it?

2902
03:09:41,060 --> 03:09:41,580
Oops.

2903
03:09:42,500 --> 03:09:42,780
Off-roading?

2904
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:45,900
We're spreading code now.

2905
03:09:46,160 --> 03:09:48,200
I love a good code spread.

2906
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:49,580
I don't want to say it.

2907
03:09:49,640 --> 03:09:50,280
I don't want to...

2908
03:09:54,920 --> 03:09:56,700
She's gonna have wet pockets.

2909
03:09:57,760 --> 03:09:58,280
Wait,

2910
03:10:09,370 --> 03:10:10,870
my gas is already so low.

2911
03:10:12,050 --> 03:10:12,750
What's happening?

2912
03:10:14,010 --> 03:10:15,970
I guess this is a pretty long drive.

2913
03:10:16,990 --> 03:10:20,470
a small table onto the passenger seat and get a cigarette
light adapter.

2914
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:21,390
You have boiling water.

2915
03:10:21,950 --> 03:10:23,130
So true!

2916
03:10:27,510 --> 03:10:28,370
Never change.

2917
03:10:28,470 --> 03:10:29,390
What did I say?

2918
03:10:31,190 --> 03:10:31,930
Oh my gosh.

2919
03:10:32,310 --> 03:10:32,590
Oh my gosh.

2920
03:10:32,710 --> 03:10:33,130
The plants.

2921
03:10:33,390 --> 03:10:34,010
Okay, we're fine.

2922
03:10:35,450 --> 03:10:36,650
We're too good at this job.

2923
03:10:38,130 --> 03:10:40,590
We're gonna have to fill up at Easton.

2924
03:10:41,290 --> 03:10:41,730
Eaton.

2925
03:10:42,230 --> 03:10:43,050
Or Eaton good.

2926
03:10:43,510 --> 03:10:43,910
Oh, whoops.

2927
03:10:45,110 --> 03:10:46,010
Let's get a little closer.

2928
03:10:48,630 --> 03:10:49,130
Place.

2929
03:10:50,670 --> 03:10:50,990
Yippee!

2930
03:10:51,750 --> 03:10:52,130
Close.

2931
03:10:52,910 --> 03:10:53,370
Get in.

2932
03:10:54,970 --> 03:10:56,070
Oh, my energy.

2933
03:10:59,090 --> 03:10:59,430
Wait.

2934
03:10:59,650 --> 03:11:00,330
Easy Mart.

2935
03:11:00,590 --> 03:11:01,090
We'll have it.

2936
03:11:01,330 --> 03:11:01,870
What am I doing?

2937
03:11:04,550 --> 03:11:05,310
Oh my gosh.

2938
03:11:05,490 --> 03:11:05,650
Get in.

2939
03:11:05,670 --> 03:11:06,050
Get in.

2940
03:11:06,050 --> 03:11:06,170
Get in.

2941
03:11:06,730 --> 03:11:06,990
Enter.

2942
03:11:10,620 --> 03:11:11,520
Coffee powder.

2943
03:11:17,630 --> 03:11:18,330
Oh, what did you say?

2944
03:11:19,070 --> 03:11:19,750
6.98.

2945
03:11:19,950 --> 03:11:20,550
Okay, thank you.

2946
03:11:21,910 --> 03:11:22,410
Cheers.

2947
03:11:22,510 --> 03:11:24,310
All right, put it away.

2948
03:11:25,250 --> 03:11:25,950
Coffee powder, more.

2949
03:11:26,370 --> 03:11:26,650
Bye.

2950
03:11:28,490 --> 03:11:33,970
I like to start my day with a simple 17-mile kilometer jog
filed by three hours of meditation.

2951
03:11:35,230 --> 03:11:36,610
You should try some time.

2952
03:11:38,490 --> 03:11:38,770
Cheers.

2953
03:11:39,070 --> 03:11:43,870
Okay, I'm going to get one can of energy drink because we're
so low.

2954
03:11:47,670 --> 03:11:48,210
Cheers.

2955
03:11:48,810 --> 03:11:49,890
All right, now we can drink this.

2956
03:11:51,950 --> 03:11:52,490
Cheers.

2957
03:11:52,510 --> 03:11:55,230
Did I say 17 mile kilometers?

2958
03:11:56,110 --> 03:11:56,110
Sorry.

2959
03:12:01,110 --> 03:12:04,910
You know, we're bridging the gaps, everybody.

2960
03:12:05,650 --> 03:12:06,830
The cultural gaps.

2961
03:12:07,850 --> 03:12:11,610
For those who don't understand miles and for those who don't
understand kilometers.

2962
03:12:12,870 --> 03:12:13,690
I am worldwide!

2963
03:12:27,770 --> 03:12:29,850
I wonder what the duct tape in the birdseed is for.

2964
03:12:36,770 --> 03:12:38,650
I'm just making it easy for everybody.

2965
03:12:40,990 --> 03:12:42,330
I come from Chupacabra.

2966
03:12:42,930 --> 03:12:43,370
Welcome!

2967
03:12:46,590 --> 03:12:50,630
It's the night of the Chupacabra!

2968
03:12:53,530 --> 03:13:05,990
It's funny, uh, the, um, the person who did the lyrics for
Night of the Chupacabra, she, I got to see her at, uh, the

2969
03:13:05,990 --> 03:13:06,570
Mid Cafe.

2970
03:13:06,770 --> 03:13:10,470
And I was like, thank you for the lyrics.

2971
03:13:11,570 --> 03:13:17,130
And the bing bing bong, I think, was directly from, like,
bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing.

2972
03:13:19,010 --> 03:13:21,630
So, that's like an actual Minto reference.

2973
03:13:22,950 --> 03:13:23,190
Shortcut.

2974
03:13:37,770 --> 03:13:38,190
Yeah.

2975
03:13:38,890 --> 03:13:40,250
Bing bong is canon.

2976
03:13:40,850 --> 03:13:41,170
Yeah.

2977
03:13:43,110 --> 03:13:46,310
I'm going to go do some more jobs in, like, the mountain
area.

2978
03:13:52,110 --> 03:13:53,310
But first, I'm going to...

2979
03:13:57,340 --> 03:13:58,020
That's cool.

2980
03:13:58,260 --> 03:13:59,060
Yeah, I thought so.

2981
03:13:59,060 --> 03:14:01,180
I was like, oh, this is such a nice touch.

2982
03:14:04,360 --> 03:14:07,120
I'm, I'm in, I'm a canon Toho.

2983
03:14:10,540 --> 03:14:12,660
Toho lore or something.

2984
03:14:17,100 --> 03:14:18,520
Oh, that's, there goes my car.

2985
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:22,700
It's fine, it'll come back down.

2986
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:26,940
There you go then.

2987
03:14:28,780 --> 03:14:29,600
There we go.

2988
03:14:33,680 --> 03:14:37,140
Your pocket coffee is going to turn to iced coffee in this
weather.

2989
03:14:38,300 --> 03:14:38,420
Yummy.

2990
03:14:39,020 --> 03:14:39,580
Coffee powder.

2991
03:14:40,380 --> 03:14:40,560
Cook.

2992
03:14:46,260 --> 03:14:48,020
Minky Toho stream win!

2993
03:14:49,100 --> 03:14:50,200
What game should I play?

2994
03:14:51,140 --> 03:14:52,420
Oh, I think it's ready.

2995
03:15:00,830 --> 03:15:02,770
I think I should just make all of it.

2996
03:15:08,370 --> 03:15:09,190
Cherno one.

2997
03:15:10,010 --> 03:15:11,010
Which one?

2998
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:18,300
Start at the first one.

2999
03:15:18,920 --> 03:15:19,880
Like PC 98?

3000
03:15:20,220 --> 03:15:20,620
First one?

3001
03:15:26,020 --> 03:15:26,620
EOSD.

3002
03:15:27,640 --> 03:15:29,380
That does have my wife in it.

3003
03:15:30,840 --> 03:15:32,040
My mistress.

3004
03:15:33,740 --> 03:15:34,880
Remilia Scarlet.

3005
03:15:35,180 --> 03:15:38,780
Minto Thon is beating every Toho game in order on night.

3006
03:15:38,940 --> 03:15:40,600
That's the entire...

3007
03:15:40,600 --> 03:15:43,700
My whole week... I think it would take longer than I'm not
gonna lie.

3008
03:15:51,950 --> 03:15:53,850
I would have to truly lock in.

3009
03:15:56,390 --> 03:16:00,690
I do think though some things will be like watchalongs of at
least like, what's the word?

3010
03:16:05,470 --> 03:16:08,850
Royalty, no, public domain movies and things like that.

3011
03:16:11,930 --> 03:16:14,350
So that I can just kind of like rest and watch a movie.

3012
03:16:14,650 --> 03:16:16,290
I don't know, it'll be like for me a 2 a.m.

3013
03:16:16,350 --> 03:16:16,830
movie or something.

3014
03:16:19,830 --> 03:16:24,390
So that way you guys don't have to get the movies or
anything like that either.

3015
03:16:26,450 --> 03:16:28,250
You can just watch some old classics.

3016
03:16:29,170 --> 03:16:31,130
Oh, let's get a job.

3017
03:16:34,630 --> 03:16:35,230
Local.

3018
03:16:36,630 --> 03:16:37,590
Give me the big bucks.

3019
03:16:38,490 --> 03:16:38,990
Big bucks.

3020
03:16:40,470 --> 03:16:43,430
140 kilograms, but it's just only...

3021
03:16:43,430 --> 03:16:44,650
Wait, it's so much.

3022
03:16:50,510 --> 03:16:52,990
That's like the opposite of what we need to do.

3023
03:16:53,910 --> 03:16:54,490
West and Eastern.

3024
03:16:54,750 --> 03:16:55,850
Okay, we'll do that one.

3025
03:16:59,580 --> 03:17:00,820
Pick up from Easy Depot.

3026
03:17:10,480 --> 03:17:11,200
Ace Combat.

3027
03:17:11,800 --> 03:17:18,920
I think, though, for Ace Combat games, I want to like make
them, I want to start it with like a...

3028
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:21,240
As like an individual stream.

3029
03:17:21,240 --> 03:17:22,820
Not in the Dono.

3030
03:17:23,400 --> 03:17:24,180
Not, oh my gosh.

3031
03:17:24,480 --> 03:17:25,600
I can't call it a Dono-Tan.

3032
03:17:26,360 --> 03:17:27,080
What do I call it?

3033
03:17:27,140 --> 03:17:27,860
Minto-Tan.

3034
03:17:29,240 --> 03:17:29,640
I guess.

3035
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:34,440
It's a YouTube channel called Broken Trout that specializes
in public domain noir.

3036
03:17:34,960 --> 03:17:36,580
Pope Sci-Fi films.

3037
03:17:37,160 --> 03:17:37,340
Oh!

3038
03:17:38,780 --> 03:17:39,560
Thank you, Doc.

3039
03:17:39,680 --> 03:17:42,240
Wait, Doc Talk, can you comment that so I can look it up
later?

3040
03:17:44,640 --> 03:17:45,300
Minto-Tan.

3041
03:17:45,640 --> 03:17:46,440
Minto-Tan.

3042
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:48,200
Non-stop Minto.

3043
03:17:49,760 --> 03:17:50,040
Oh!

3044
03:18:10,120 --> 03:18:10,920
Minky's on.

3045
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:17,080
I want to try and focus on like non...

3046
03:18:17,620 --> 03:18:18,580
What's the word?

3047
03:18:21,620 --> 03:18:26,360
Games that are not like super story heavy, you know, since
I'll be streaming for so long.

3048
03:18:27,700 --> 03:18:31,100
I don't want people to come in and be like, I'm lost, you
know what I mean?

3049
03:18:33,460 --> 03:18:35,880
I've played some mainline Toho games and they are truly
hard.

3050
03:18:35,940 --> 03:18:36,360
Oh yeah!

3051
03:18:39,080 --> 03:18:43,440
I've beaten the... I've beaten... Oh gosh, I can't even
remember anymore.

3052
03:18:44,420 --> 03:18:46,420
EOSD I beat back in the day.

3053
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:48,020
Um,

3054
03:18:51,120 --> 03:18:52,100
what else?

3055
03:18:53,280 --> 03:18:54,760
Mountain of Faith, I think.

3056
03:18:55,980 --> 03:18:57,160
I don't remember.

3057
03:18:58,580 --> 03:18:59,560
I don't remember.

3058
03:19:01,100 --> 03:19:01,800
Western.

3059
03:19:03,060 --> 03:19:04,080
Easy people.

3060
03:19:11,060 --> 03:19:12,820
Do you like to scare?

3061
03:19:13,440 --> 03:19:15,100
And when you scare, do you become a...

3062
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:31,060
nightmare i'm golden minke i like to scare and when i scare

3065
03:19:50,050 --> 03:19:56,430

3066
03:19:56,890 --> 03:20:01,710
Tell Ellie, welcome valued customer DD78.

3067
03:20:03,550 --> 03:20:05,770
Hear me out, Kerbal, stay- Oh, guys.

3068
03:20:05,950 --> 03:20:07,290
You want me to use my brain for real?

3069
03:20:09,250 --> 03:20:10,550
I'll become an engineer.

3070
03:20:13,350 --> 03:20:16,970
I guess Minky-Ton is a perfect excuse to return to YouTube
playable.

3071
03:20:17,150 --> 03:20:18,290
So good, so true.

3072
03:20:20,770 --> 03:20:21,850
I have a secret.

3073
03:20:22,770 --> 03:20:24,230
I've been playing them off stream.

3074
03:20:25,050 --> 03:20:25,990
The YouTube playables.

3075
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:31,400
I've been playing them.

3076
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:44,040
Without us?

3077
03:20:45,220 --> 03:20:46,220
I'm sorry!

3078
03:20:50,580 --> 03:20:53,180
Wait, we just watched this guy get reset in front of us.

3079
03:20:55,660 --> 03:20:56,960
How might we assist you today?

3080
03:20:57,320 --> 03:20:58,420
The payload.

3081
03:21:01,620 --> 03:21:03,920
He just got reset in front of us.

3082
03:21:11,580 --> 03:21:14,540
She plays games not for content.

3083
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:18,140
Okay, but most games I play for content.

3084
03:21:20,080 --> 03:21:25,620
But there are sometimes games, like YouTube playables, that
probably don't.

3085
03:21:28,060 --> 03:21:30,120
I'm turning it down just a tad.

3086
03:21:32,220 --> 03:21:35,360
You don't need to see every YouTube playable, do you?

3087
03:21:35,840 --> 03:21:37,280
Wait, why am I delivering this to you?

3088
03:21:38,640 --> 03:21:40,000
Okay, right by the fuel.

3089
03:21:40,860 --> 03:21:42,740
Oh, I think it's pizza.

3090
03:21:44,680 --> 03:21:45,580
Yappa games.

3091
03:21:46,940 --> 03:21:48,420
Yappa dappa do!

3092
03:21:49,100 --> 03:21:49,820
Oh, this way.

3093
03:21:50,460 --> 03:21:50,960
Shortcut.

3094
03:21:57,540 --> 03:21:58,120
Pizza!

3095
03:22:00,120 --> 03:22:02,340
Oh, we almost lost pizza.

3096
03:22:05,750 --> 03:22:06,750
Oh, ouch.

3097
03:22:06,990 --> 03:22:08,450
Wait, my car!

3098
03:22:09,090 --> 03:22:09,490
Oh, shoot.

3099
03:22:10,370 --> 03:22:10,590
Wait.

3100
03:22:11,070 --> 03:22:11,590
Come back.

3101
03:22:12,450 --> 03:22:13,500
I forgot to park.

3102
03:22:23,390 --> 03:22:24,440
Right here?

3103
03:22:25,660 --> 03:22:26,490
Where are you?

3104
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:29,000
Oh, here.

3105
03:22:34,740 --> 03:22:36,280
Have an easy day!

3106
03:22:36,880 --> 03:22:37,360
Awesome.

3107
03:22:38,460 --> 03:22:39,100
Oh, we need gas.

3108
03:22:39,120 --> 03:22:40,740
Bad, bad, okay.

3109
03:22:41,440 --> 03:22:42,980
No, he's gonna take all our money!

3110
03:22:50,020 --> 03:22:52,100
Can't believe my Oshi's into Neto game.

3111
03:22:54,360 --> 03:22:56,040
I know I'm trash!

3112
03:22:57,180 --> 03:22:59,860
Min-totan, beating every YouTube playable on Nightmare.

3113
03:23:02,320 --> 03:23:04,060
Exactly who I wanted to see.

3114
03:23:04,860 --> 03:23:08,080
To prove that there is no such thing as a benevolent god.

3115
03:23:08,360 --> 03:23:09,020
Oh my god.

3116
03:23:09,940 --> 03:23:12,540
I hear the long dark 2 is coming out next year and it's
multiplayer.

3117
03:23:13,180 --> 03:23:14,920
So it might be a fun thing to try.

3118
03:23:15,280 --> 03:23:15,720
Long dark.

3119
03:23:16,280 --> 03:23:16,440
Dude.

3120
03:23:17,320 --> 03:23:18,080
Give me $60.

3121
03:23:18,640 --> 03:23:19,540
I don't have that!

3122
03:23:20,420 --> 03:23:21,420
26.43.

3123
03:23:21,520 --> 03:23:22,320
Now go away.

3124
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:24,060
I'm taking my money.

3125
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:26,680
What are we at?

3126
03:23:27,400 --> 03:23:28,760
Okay, we're at halfway.

3127
03:23:30,640 --> 03:23:32,040
Let's go to Fishtown.

3128
03:23:34,760 --> 03:23:38,120
There should be gas and jobs there, right?

3129
03:23:38,360 --> 03:23:38,640
Surely.

3130
03:23:40,460 --> 03:23:41,100
Surely.

3131
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:42,640
Surely.

3132
03:23:43,180 --> 03:23:43,940
No money.

3133
03:23:46,100 --> 03:23:47,160
Tunnel to fish.

3134
03:23:48,600 --> 03:23:48,660
Oh!

3135
03:23:49,260 --> 03:23:50,520
Radio tower, just kidding.

3136
03:23:51,940 --> 03:23:53,400
I was about to be like, what a second?

3137
03:23:53,560 --> 03:23:54,520
I saw wood there.

3138
03:23:56,480 --> 03:23:58,100
I'm gonna burn that wood.

3139
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:00,100
We already went there.

3140
03:24:01,680 --> 03:24:03,080
I lived and I died there.

3141
03:24:04,280 --> 03:24:05,160
Back it up.

3142
03:24:05,860 --> 03:24:08,040
The eyeball yearn for slump!

3143
03:24:09,300 --> 03:24:10,600
I'm really glad I'm...

3144
03:24:10,600 --> 03:24:12,340

Oh shoot, I'm gonna die.

03:25:28,820 --> 03:25:29,280
Open the gate.

3153
03:25:30,400 --> 03:25:31,620
Security gate complete.

3154
03:25:33,060 --> 03:25:34,280
You're the eye best.

3155
03:25:37,140 --> 03:25:41,620
I liked being a wisp, but if it causes a lisp, I will
desist.

3156
03:25:46,100 --> 03:25:47,980
It's nothing to cry, boo-boo about.

3157
03:25:48,320 --> 03:25:52,780
I think it also allows for funny wordplay too.

3158

Wait.

3163
03:26:43,740 --> 03:26:44,600
We're spooky?

3164
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:45,700
Yeah, spooky.

3165
03:26:50,580 --> 03:26:51,780
Maybe it went down.

3166
03:26:53,160 --> 03:26:54,220
Maybe it's timed.

3167
03:26:55,660 --> 03:26:57,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3168
03:26:58,680 --> 03:26:59,560
Blast it!

03:27:03,460 --> 03:27:04,320
Oh, it does.

3170
03:27:04,400 --> 03:27:05,120
It is timed, okay.

3171
03:27:05,840 --> 03:27:06,220
Hello!

3172
03:27:07,460 --> 03:27:09,040
It's good to see you here.

3173
03:27:10,100 --> 03:27:14,040
I need you to get the supplies from the dam, but it's
guarded by more gates.

3174
03:27:14,860 --> 03:27:16,200
Not as big as this one though.

3175
03:27:16,640 --> 03:27:19,880
Seems like with enough force, you could smash through them!

3176
03:27:21,880 --> 03:27:23,520
Read at the easy auto.

3177
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:25,760
Here we'll set you up.

3178
03:27:27,420 --> 03:27:28,360
Bumper bar.

3179
03:27:28,940 --> 03:27:31,120
Can we be your eternal partners, Minto?

3180
03:27:33,940 --> 03:27:35,440
Well, I'm eternal.

3181
03:27:36,420 --> 03:27:36,800
17.

3182
03:27:37,240 --> 03:27:37,660
I mean, sorry.

3183
03:27:37,820 --> 03:27:38,160
I did.

3184
03:27:38,380 --> 03:27:38,660
Oh, shoot.

3185
03:27:38,820 --> 03:27:39,220
Oh, my gosh.

3186
03:27:39,320 --> 03:27:40,060
I'm so tired.

3187
03:27:40,480 --> 03:27:41,840
No, the...

3188
03:27:43,320 --> 03:27:47,540
So, I mean, as long as I don't go, as long as I don't pass
on, then, you know.

3189
03:27:51,400 --> 03:27:52,920
As long as we're yours, partner.

3190
03:27:54,160 --> 03:27:55,020
No, I'm legal.

3191
03:27:59,020 --> 03:28:00,180
Lying about her age?

3192
03:28:00,280 --> 03:28:00,640
No!

3193
03:28:01,880 --> 03:28:02,580
I'm not!

3194
03:28:05,060 --> 03:28:08,840
It's because You know, so many say you say they're forever
17.

3195
03:28:09,960 --> 03:28:10,620
But I'm 19.

3196
03:28:12,820 --> 03:28:15,920
So it's like it just comes out my mouth is forever 17.

3197
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:17,380
But I'm 19.

3198
03:28:18,500 --> 03:28:20,540
Oh my gosh, Nimmy Nightmare is playing Outer Wild.

3199
03:28:20,780 --> 03:28:22,000
I wonder if she's recording more.

3200
03:28:22,900 --> 03:28:23,500
Anyway, sorry.

3201
03:28:24,380 --> 03:28:25,300
They'll still make you pay.

3202
03:28:25,480 --> 03:28:26,240
It's not their fault.

3203
03:28:27,100 --> 03:28:28,940
You'll probably need to take some more delivery jobs.

3204
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:32,860
In the meantime, I'll figure out a way to get this gate open
permanently.

3205
03:28:33,480 --> 03:28:34,860
You're stuck on this side for now.

3206
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:38,480
There used to be some great spots for ice fishing.

3207
03:28:39,420 --> 03:28:42,180
I think Fortino has a fishing rod on sale at the depot.

3208
03:28:43,220 --> 03:28:44,860
No wonder if the fish are still biting.

3209
03:28:45,620 --> 03:28:46,760
Good luck out there.

3210
03:28:47,640 --> 03:28:48,440
Nimmy exposed.

3211
03:28:49,080 --> 03:28:50,840
She posted about it.

3212
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:52,880
That she was...

3213
03:28:52,880 --> 03:28:55,600
Did we get a new song then?

3214
03:28:55,700 --> 03:29:00,420
I've been listening to this song for a while, so I'm like,
ready for a new soundtrack, you know?

3215
03:29:04,160 --> 03:29:05,600

03:29:39,430 --> 03:29:39,910

3222

3223
03:29:44,790 --> 03:29:45,830
These are small.

3224
03:29:46,790 --> 03:29:47,370
Uh-oh.

3225
03:29:49,330 --> 03:29:50,450
Uh-oh.

3226
03:29:52,190 --> 03:29:52,910
No money.

3227
03:29:54,210 --> 03:29:55,970

3228
03:29:58,270 --> 03:29:58,990

Okay, so to...

3235
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:16,060

3236
03:30:16,260 --> 03:30:16,440
Okay.

3237
03:30:18,380 --> 03:30:19,300
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3238
03:30:19,560 --> 03:30:20,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

3239
03:30:20,900 --> 03:30:23,120
I have to say the forbidden J word.

3240
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:26,260
Yab.

3241
03:30:26,820 --> 03:30:27,440
Yab.

3242
03:30:28,080 --> 03:30:30,500
What's my favorite episode of Breaking Bad so far?

3243
03:30:31,500 --> 03:30:31,900
Oh.

3244
03:30:33,680 --> 03:30:34,640

3245
03:30:39,750 --> 03:30:40,410
Um...

3246
03:30:40,410 --> 03:30:41,670
Leaving Clifton.

3247
03:30:42,050 --> 03:30:46,950
I don't know.

3248
03:30:55,230 --> 03:30:56,130
How far are you?

3249
03:30:56,330 --> 03:31:03,470

tired.

3251
03:31:10,730 --> 03:31:13,210

03:31:59,180 --> 03:31:59,800
Okay, okay, okay.

03:32:00,200 --> 03:32:01,360
I thought I was over here.

3260
03:32:05,900 --> 03:32:06,300

3261
03:32:15,570 --> 03:32:15,970
Yo.

3262
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:22,900
There's, like, houses on the water.

3263
03:32:23,840 --> 03:32:24,240
Interesting.

3264
03:32:26,100 --> 03:32:26,500
Okay.

3265
03:32:27,040 --> 03:32:27,960
What do they belong to?

3266
03:32:28,040 --> 03:32:28,500
Is that pizza?

3267
03:32:31,180 --> 03:32:33,400
Oh, I need to ram into that, don't I?

3268
03:32:34,740 --> 03:32:35,840
No stinking way.

3269
03:32:47,030 --> 03:32:48,350
They're ice fishing huts.

3270
03:32:48,550 --> 03:32:49,370
Oh, that's so cute!

3271
03:32:49,850 --> 03:32:54,030
Hey, when you see old Tooe again, give him a dead-eyed stare
for me.

3272
03:32:54,150 --> 03:32:54,550
Would you?

3273
03:32:58,110 --> 03:32:59,150
I'll take that.

3274
03:32:59,290 --> 03:33:00,210
Thank you very much.

3275
03:33:05,030 --> 03:33:06,690
You think I can ram that yet?

3276
03:33:06,830 --> 03:33:07,510
Probably not.

3277
03:33:12,700 --> 03:33:14,090
Let's try it.

3278
03:33:17,240 --> 03:33:17,920
Damnton.

3279
03:33:19,360 --> 03:33:20,100
Damnton.

3280
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:25,940
All right, so we are headed to...

3281
03:33:25,940 --> 03:33:26,580
No way.

3282
03:33:27,340 --> 03:33:30,040
We have to go around the entire map.

3283
03:33:30,740 --> 03:33:35,140
We have to go around the entire map, even though it's just
right there.

3284
03:33:38,580 --> 03:33:39,780
Oh, evil!

3285
03:33:45,710 --> 03:33:46,750
It's Darnton.

3286
03:33:49,010 --> 03:33:50,210
The Great Trek.

3287
03:33:51,450 --> 03:33:56,550
This person will get their beer when it's beer clock.

3288
03:33:57,190 --> 03:33:59,390
Which is on my terms.

3289
03:34:04,170 --> 03:34:04,730
Darn it.

3290
03:34:15,680 --> 03:34:18,060
I'm sad that the days are getting longer now.

3291
03:34:18,160 --> 03:34:20,360
I want to live in a place that looks like this all the time.

3292
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:21,700
Like this?

3293
03:34:24,380 --> 03:34:26,460
I don't think I can live without the sun.

3294
03:34:26,480 --> 03:34:31,740
Well, you know, I can't live at all, but I don't like to be
without the sun.

3295
03:34:33,880 --> 03:34:34,300
You know?

3296
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:40,040
Wait, raise your hand if this is like your peak weather all
the time.

3297
03:34:40,700 --> 03:34:42,340
If you would be so happy with this.

3298
03:34:45,420 --> 03:34:46,980
It's my dream too.

3299
03:34:47,960 --> 03:34:48,400
Really?

3300
03:34:49,900 --> 03:34:51,220
I missed this up.

3301
03:34:54,040 --> 03:34:55,440
No, we're not going to Clifton.

3302
03:34:56,700 --> 03:35:08,100
That's Clifton We're going to Dampton I'm cold at 70 Whoa

bad of a...

3306
03:35:37,060 --> 03:35:37,440
Oh, whoops.

3307
03:35:37,900 --> 03:35:38,640
This way.

3308
03:35:39,280 --> 03:35:41,340
That was actually pretty fast, you guys.

3309
03:35:41,560 --> 03:35:41,940
Good job.

3310
03:35:46,200 --> 03:35:47,460
That wasn't so bad at all.

3311
03:35:52,410 --> 03:35:52,850
Yahoo!

3312
03:35:55,710 --> 03:35:57,430
I prefer the cold for sure.

3313
03:35:58,270 --> 03:35:58,630
Really?

3314
03:36:08,850 --> 03:36:09,890
Smallton to Clifton.

3315
03:36:10,030 --> 03:36:10,930
I want shouldn't be so bad.

3316
03:36:11,010 --> 03:36:12,150
Wait, is it pizza again?

3317
03:36:13,670 --> 03:36:15,330
We're in Dampton right now.

3318
03:36:15,490 --> 03:36:18,270
Maybe we go to, wait, Smolton is all the way to the other
side again.

3319
03:36:21,150 --> 03:36:25,150
If I could turn down my draw distance IRL, I would silent
hill peak weather.

3320
03:36:25,330 --> 03:36:26,030
No way.

3321
03:36:41,890 --> 03:36:43,830
I think we gotta focus on the big money.

3322
03:36:48,030 --> 03:36:49,990
Oh my god, going all the way back to Easy Pizza.

3323
03:36:56,720 --> 03:36:57,100
Okay.

3324
03:37:01,850 --> 03:37:03,670
I was just out in the cold while I was gone.

3325
03:37:05,270 --> 03:37:06,230
wasn't bad at all.

3326
03:37:08,570 --> 03:37:10,650
Let's see if we can break down the thing over here.

3327
03:37:15,780 --> 03:37:17,260
Maybe on one side.

3328
03:37:21,370 --> 03:37:22,070
Here I go!

3329
03:37:26,520 --> 03:37:26,940
Sad.

3330
03:37:29,240 --> 03:37:30,040
Wait, what is this?

3331
03:37:37,590 --> 03:37:38,650
I cannot go in.

3332
03:37:39,830 --> 03:37:40,950
I cannot get up.

3333
03:37:41,410 --> 03:37:41,830
Oh my god.

3334
03:37:46,940 --> 03:37:47,960
Can I go in over here?

3335
03:37:48,140 --> 03:37:48,720
Is this a door?

3336
03:37:53,580 --> 03:37:55,320
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3337
03:37:56,080 --> 03:37:58,720
I wish

3338
03:38:04,120 --> 03:38:05,000
I had more snow.

3339
03:38:06,140 --> 03:38:06,740
Snow, snow.

3340
03:38:07,160 --> 03:38:08,320
We need more snow.

3341
03:38:11,800 --> 03:38:13,360
Now we're back to Boots and Cats.

3342
03:38:13,560 --> 03:38:14,740
We've been out to Boots and Cats.

3343
03:38:15,740 --> 03:38:15,940
Wait.

3344
03:38:16,900 --> 03:38:18,580
I'm going to Smalton, not Clifton.

3345
03:38:22,770 --> 03:38:23,230
Or, wait.

3346
03:38:23,330 --> 03:38:24,310
Oh, just kidding.

3347
03:38:24,670 --> 03:38:24,890
Yes.

3348
03:38:27,470 --> 03:38:28,350
Stay frosty.

3349
03:38:29,270 --> 03:38:43,930
Oh yeah baby I don't know I like I think I appreciate Okay

that's the Only wait, that's the, I feel like that's the

3352
03:39:00,170 --> 03:39:01,810
best way to get through the weather and all.

3353
03:39:03,210 --> 03:39:04,390
Know exactly what you mean.

3354
03:39:04,550 --> 03:39:09,550
Yeah, like, I want to be at, like, a bookstore cafe or
something.

3355
03:39:10,950 --> 03:39:14,350
And, like, just kind of, that's how I will weather the
storm.

3356
03:39:14,970 --> 03:39:15,950
Kind of way.

3357
03:39:18,370 --> 03:39:19,250
Cozy streamer.

3358
03:39:19,530 --> 03:39:19,730
Ah!

3359
03:39:41,940 --> 03:39:42,380
Smolting.

3360
03:39:43,780 --> 03:39:45,240
Alright, let's get that.

3361
03:39:47,660 --> 03:39:48,820
Wait, is it this way?

3362
03:39:49,180 --> 03:39:49,680
I think so.

3363
03:39:51,320 --> 03:39:54,840
I think up there was the gas station.

3364
03:39:55,480 --> 03:39:57,800
Which we're gonna need gas soon-ish.

3365
03:39:58,500 --> 03:40:01,920
Oh my gosh, they're gonna eat all of our money before we
can...

3366
03:40:06,550 --> 03:40:09,490
Best way for this weather is with a Minto stream.

3367
03:40:10,610 --> 03:40:11,150
So true.

3368
03:40:11,270 --> 03:40:11,770
Whoops, my bad.

3369
03:40:13,530 --> 03:40:14,150
Screamer.

3370
03:40:15,130 --> 03:40:17,010
Is Mint Phantom a screamer?

3371
03:40:20,270 --> 03:40:20,890
Hey!

3372
03:40:21,710 --> 03:40:24,550
How come Iziko gave you a right-hand drive truck?

3373
03:40:25,410 --> 03:40:28,110
Better yet, how come they let you drive at all?

3374
03:40:28,950 --> 03:40:32,590
You drive like a goose-gain sentience and lost its morals.

3375
03:40:37,960 --> 03:40:38,280
What?

3376
03:40:39,080 --> 03:40:40,180
Why are you guys... What's wrong?

3377
03:40:43,220 --> 03:40:43,780
Wait, what?

3378
03:40:47,840 --> 03:40:48,340
Honk!

3379
03:40:50,540 --> 03:40:51,340
Holy cow!

3380
03:40:51,580 --> 03:40:52,700
So much pizza!

3381
03:40:58,980 --> 03:41:00,720
I think you guys were the super chats.

3382
03:41:00,840 --> 03:41:03,020
For some reason, I used to be able to get out of...

3383
03:41:03,020 --> 03:41:03,340
Hold on.

3384
03:41:03,520 --> 03:41:04,060
I'm going to try this.

3385
03:41:04,440 --> 03:41:05,040
Oh, there we go.

3386
03:41:06,100 --> 03:41:09,980
Whether I want to be blanketed up with hot cocoa, book two,
and not dropping off this cliff.

3387
03:41:10,220 --> 03:41:10,980
Big same-sies.

3388
03:41:12,440 --> 03:41:15,740
Looks like I'm getting more than 50 degree temperature drop
in the next couple...

3389
03:41:15,740 --> 03:41:16,220
Oh!

3390
03:41:16,900 --> 03:41:18,100
That's so much!

3391
03:41:20,220 --> 03:41:21,520
All the pizza.

3392
03:41:21,900 --> 03:41:22,500
Where am I going?

3393
03:41:23,680 --> 03:41:24,360
Clift.

3394
03:41:28,500 --> 03:41:29,600
They won't mind.

3395
03:41:31,280 --> 03:41:31,800
Look at that.

3396
03:41:32,320 --> 03:41:33,200
Only lost one.

3397
03:41:33,520 --> 03:41:33,660
Easy.

3398
03:41:35,160 --> 03:41:35,760
I'm too good.

3399
03:41:39,590 --> 03:41:42,790
The best pizza in all of London.

3400
03:41:44,770 --> 03:41:46,150
Owl's pizza palace.

3401
03:41:48,390 --> 03:41:50,150
You guys think the headlights are doing anything?

3402
03:41:51,390 --> 03:41:52,870
You're delivering to Brent Halligan.

3403
03:41:58,150 --> 03:42:01,730
I need to play more silly point-and-click-im.

3404
03:42:03,370 --> 03:42:05,750
I was thinking about playing Freddy Fish today.

3405
03:42:05,950 --> 03:42:07,390
I think I talked about it on stream.

3406
03:42:07,550 --> 03:42:09,490
I was like, oh my gosh, I want to play Freddy Fish.

3407
03:42:10,150 --> 03:42:11,250
Relive my childhood.

3408
03:42:11,810 --> 03:42:13,010
And I was going to play it today.

3409
03:42:13,650 --> 03:42:14,490
And then, oh, shoot.

3410
03:42:15,290 --> 03:42:18,570
I was going to include it on my 50 yintins this year.

3411
03:42:20,130 --> 03:42:22,330
But I was reading the reviews.

3412
03:42:23,430 --> 03:42:33,690
and some of the reviews they weren't bad in that like the
like it was breaking like in breaking bugs or anything like

3413
03:42:33,690 --> 03:42:41,630
that but there was people being like you know i can't really
recommend this game to adults or like they were like it's

3414
03:42:41,630 --> 03:42:52,310
great for maybe like nostalgia but if you didn't play this
game it's kind of bad and i was like oh no like it's my own

3415
03:42:52,330 --> 03:43:02,890
selfish request to play it but if it's bad for anybody else
then like i don't want you know if someone's just like i

3416
03:43:02,890 --> 03:43:11,050
don't i didn't play this so it's stupid and bad your stream
of it

3417
03:43:15,980 --> 03:43:26,620
you think it'd still be fun though i think so wait wait
other way Sounds peak.

3418
03:43:27,260 --> 03:43:28,740
You think they were being too serious?

3419
03:43:29,200 --> 03:43:29,460
Uh-oh.

3420
03:43:29,760 --> 03:43:29,880
Oh.

3421
03:43:30,880 --> 03:43:31,420
Let's go.

3422
03:43:38,320 --> 03:43:39,480
For sure.

3423
03:43:52,030 --> 03:43:53,150
Have an easy day.

3424
03:43:54,790 --> 03:43:56,830
All right, we're not even halfway through.

3425
03:43:59,350 --> 03:44:00,510
Oh, and I...

3426
03:44:00,510 --> 03:44:03,250
Oh my gosh, the fishing rod is $124!

3427
03:44:06,930 --> 03:44:09,550
Intercity deliveries are a stronger source of income.

3428
03:44:12,890 --> 03:44:14,410
That's what we need right now.

3429
03:44:15,310 --> 03:44:16,370
And you need money for gas.

3430
03:44:16,530 --> 03:44:19,150
I know they're going to take like $60 for gas.

3431
03:44:24,510 --> 03:44:25,570
Gates and trees.

3432
03:44:27,250 --> 03:44:27,810
Wait a second.

3433
03:44:34,890 --> 03:44:37,850
Let's do Clifton to Dampton.

3434
03:44:39,170 --> 03:44:40,070
Because we're right here.

3435
03:44:40,650 --> 03:44:41,910
Pick up from Easy Auto.

3436
03:44:43,910 --> 03:44:44,390
Okay.

3437
03:44:44,410 --> 03:44:45,730
Is this easy auto?

3438
03:44:46,690 --> 03:44:47,610
This is the bar.

3439
03:44:51,390 --> 03:44:56,090
There's one Freddy Fish game with an easter egg where Freddy
Fish fantasizes about murdering his friend.

3440
03:45:01,710 --> 03:45:02,530
Why is the pizza?

3441
03:45:02,870 --> 03:45:03,690
It fell over.

3442
03:45:04,810 --> 03:45:05,610
No way.

3443
03:45:11,600 --> 03:45:13,080
This is easy, Mark.

3444
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:15,840
Where is it?

3445
03:45:16,080 --> 03:45:16,420
Easy auto.

3446
03:45:24,810 --> 03:45:25,930
Where is it?

3447
03:45:26,330 --> 03:45:27,170
I'm off-roading.

3448
03:45:30,330 --> 03:45:30,810
Oh!

3449
03:45:33,330 --> 03:45:35,150
It's gonna have the porch light on.

3450
03:45:35,390 --> 03:45:36,030
Oh, that's right.

3451
03:45:38,390 --> 03:45:39,750
Cosmology of Kyoto.

3452
03:45:41,450 --> 03:45:43,590
Journeyman Project Turbo, Space Quest.

3453
03:45:44,270 --> 03:45:46,810
Conquest of the Longbow.

3454
03:45:46,950 --> 03:45:49,430
I've never heard of literally a single one of these.

3455
03:45:52,490 --> 03:45:54,450
Oh, I think... Okay, I know where we are.

3456
03:45:55,610 --> 03:45:56,330
We got our Yui.

3457
03:45:56,990 --> 03:45:57,570
There we go.

3458
03:45:58,290 --> 03:45:58,890
This way.

3459
03:46:06,330 --> 03:46:07,750
Oh gosh, my energy.

3460
03:46:08,230 --> 03:46:08,930
Oh my god, my energy.

3461
03:46:09,490 --> 03:46:10,210
Oh my god, my energy.

3462
03:46:18,170 --> 03:46:18,310
Oh?

3463
03:46:19,210 --> 03:46:21,170
Seb spoke so much more than you do I?

3464
03:46:21,950 --> 03:46:23,650
You're not really a talker.

3465
03:46:24,390 --> 03:46:26,890
Also, remind me, I have to remember to tell you something.

3466
03:46:28,130 --> 03:46:28,930
I've forgotten already.

3467
03:46:30,810 --> 03:46:32,470
Cosmology of Kyoto is pretty creative.

3468
03:46:32,930 --> 03:46:34,810
Why is this like so all over the place?

3469
03:46:35,970 --> 03:46:36,410
Okay.

3470
03:46:40,690 --> 03:46:42,830
Where are we taking this bad boy to?

3471
03:46:43,690 --> 03:46:44,130
Damten.

3472
03:46:49,940 --> 03:46:50,720
If we're Gour.

3473
03:46:53,380 --> 03:46:55,240
I want to meet this Seb guy.

3474
03:46:57,440 --> 03:46:58,820
She seems really well liked.

3475
03:47:00,000 --> 03:47:02,240
And we are not so well liked, perhaps.

3476
03:47:03,220 --> 03:47:04,220
Well, we're the new guy.

3477
03:47:04,320 --> 03:47:05,880
They don't have a chance to know us yet.

3478
03:47:06,600 --> 03:47:06,900
You know?

3479
03:47:07,120 --> 03:47:11,520
We just have to really show them what we're made of.

3480
03:47:11,620 --> 03:47:12,800
It is so hard to see!

3481
03:47:19,110 --> 03:47:21,430
I hope I'm going the right way.

3482
03:47:27,120 --> 03:47:29,060
Where's the signs at?

3483
03:47:31,820 --> 03:47:33,500
Wait, am I going in a circle?

3484
03:47:34,740 --> 03:47:36,400
To Smalton, to Dampton.

3485
03:47:37,080 --> 03:47:38,680
Yeah, wait, I just went in a big circle.

3486
03:47:42,580 --> 03:47:43,540
Uh-oh.

3487
03:47:45,280 --> 03:47:45,920
Oh.

3488
03:47:46,680 --> 03:47:47,460
Uh-oh.

3489
03:47:52,610 --> 03:47:53,250
Okay.

3490
03:47:53,850 --> 03:47:55,530
To Smalton, to Dampton.

3491
03:47:58,470 --> 03:48:00,210
I'm wasting gas, you guys.

3492
03:48:00,370 --> 03:48:01,130
This is so bad.

3493
03:48:07,570 --> 03:48:08,490
We're here?

3494
03:48:09,310 --> 03:48:09,310
Here?

3495
03:48:14,420 --> 03:48:14,900
I think?

3496
03:48:18,360 --> 03:48:20,780
Keep your eyes peeled for any signs?

3497
03:48:23,360 --> 03:48:25,060
Wait, why is it just go in a circle?

3498
03:48:25,480 --> 03:48:25,700
Wait?

3499
03:48:27,660 --> 03:48:29,020
Oh, did I go this way?

3500
03:48:29,180 --> 03:48:29,400
Wait.

3501
03:48:32,520 --> 03:48:33,480
Wait a second.

3502
03:48:35,780 --> 03:48:36,540
Peeling my eyes?

3503
03:48:36,700 --> 03:48:37,760
Wait, where am I?

3504
03:48:43,020 --> 03:48:44,600
I hate this map.

3505
03:48:45,420 --> 03:48:46,920
So stinking much.

3506
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:49,100
What?

3507
03:49:06,160 --> 03:49:08,080
I'm gonna run out of gas.

3508
03:49:12,700 --> 03:49:13,100
No!

3509
03:49:14,060 --> 03:49:15,020
It's a circle!

3510
03:49:16,320 --> 03:49:16,680
Wait.

3511
03:49:17,220 --> 03:49:17,620
Oh no.

3512
03:49:18,220 --> 03:49:19,060
Oh no no.

3513
03:49:20,180 --> 03:49:21,400
No no no.

3514
03:49:22,100 --> 03:49:26,600
You're at the bottom left of the maps to this one.

3515
03:49:32,130 --> 03:49:32,710
Easy auto.

3516
03:49:33,590 --> 03:49:35,230
Okay, so I'm just here.

3517
03:49:42,050 --> 03:49:44,730
Oh, it's pointing this way, right?

3518
03:49:45,030 --> 03:49:46,150
Wait, is it?

3519
03:49:47,990 --> 03:49:48,570
I thought...

3520
03:49:48,970 --> 03:49:50,430
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.

3521
03:49:50,750 --> 03:49:52,450
I thought because it was pointing...

3522
03:49:53,090 --> 03:49:54,670
It was on to the left side.

3523
03:49:54,830 --> 03:49:55,450
I thought...

3524
03:49:55,450 --> 03:49:56,370
Wait, to Dampton.

3525
03:49:58,730 --> 03:49:59,530
We're fine.

3526
03:50:00,990 --> 03:50:01,670
Oh my god.

3527
03:50:02,450 --> 03:50:04,150
We're going to Dampton, right?

3528
03:50:07,530 --> 03:50:08,330
Minto DoorDash.

3529
03:50:08,570 --> 03:50:11,390
I'm at least not stealing your food.

3530
03:50:14,530 --> 03:50:15,670
I'm gonna lose all my...

3531
03:50:15,670 --> 03:50:16,790
Oh, this sucks.

3532
03:50:17,410 --> 03:50:18,890
Wait, this is so annoying.

3533
03:50:19,450 --> 03:50:22,670
I wish they would have told me that I would be making
pennies in here.

3534
03:50:24,310 --> 03:50:24,710
Because...

3535
03:50:25,270 --> 03:50:28,330
I'm gonna have to get gas, and then we're gonna lose all my
money.

3536
03:50:29,330 --> 03:50:31,450
No, this sucks so much.

3537
03:50:34,490 --> 03:50:35,290
To Dampton.

3538
03:50:44,160 --> 03:50:45,760
It's like life.

3539
03:50:47,520 --> 03:50:48,120
Noor!

3540
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:51,800
Can we go back to another zone?

3541
03:50:51,940 --> 03:50:53,340
They said that we can't.

3542
03:50:54,560 --> 03:50:56,240
Alright, we're in Dampton now.

3543
03:50:58,040 --> 03:50:58,580
Allegedly.

3544
03:51:00,680 --> 03:51:04,740
Whenever we see a way to go to the left.

3545
03:51:05,420 --> 03:51:06,320
The first road.

3546
03:51:07,020 --> 03:51:07,660
To our left.

3547
03:51:08,640 --> 03:51:09,100
Take that.

3548
03:51:13,270 --> 03:51:13,750
So.

3549
03:51:19,720 --> 03:51:22,480
Are you implying that DoorDash steals food?

3550
03:51:23,200 --> 03:51:25,640
Every time I hear about the...

3551
03:51:28,200 --> 03:51:31,940
About DoorDash, it's always that somebody got their food
stolen by the driver.

3552
03:51:32,420 --> 03:51:34,620
I don't use DoorDash or anything like that, so.

3553
03:51:35,300 --> 03:51:36,160
I don't know.

3554
03:51:36,660 --> 03:51:37,620
But that's all I've ever heard.

3555
03:51:37,640 --> 03:51:44,440
heard is it true is it reliable service i guess i mean
obviously depends on the driver that's delivering it but

3556
03:51:44,440 --> 03:51:53,860
when the order comes short a few nuggets the minto
guarantees that they fell off the job what yam flu welcome

3557
03:51:53,860 --> 03:51:57,000
to membership thank you

3558
03:52:11,180 --> 03:52:19,640
maybe we can get one from dampton to smallton like this one
but more money cliffton to smallton wait smallton to no well

3559
03:52:19,660 --> 03:52:22,760
do Clifton to Smolton, because we gotta go over to Clifton
again.

3560
03:52:25,860 --> 03:52:28,140
That depends, I suppose, seems to cost more than worth.

3561
03:52:28,260 --> 03:52:29,020
What, DoorDash?

3562
03:52:29,260 --> 03:52:30,100
I think so, too.

3563
03:52:31,620 --> 03:52:35,500
Doki has a lot of Uber Eats stores, but mostly not stolen
food.

3564
03:52:36,820 --> 03:52:38,160
Nah, well, thank you so much!

3565
03:52:38,520 --> 03:52:38,960
Thank you!

3566
03:52:39,320 --> 03:52:42,320
Okay, we'll do this one, because we have to go this way
anyway.

3567
03:52:44,400 --> 03:52:44,800
Or...

3568
03:52:44,800 --> 03:52:45,260
No.

3569
03:52:45,680 --> 03:52:46,980
I think we go get gas.

3570
03:52:49,400 --> 03:52:53,000
We're gonna have 50 cents to our name, pretty much.

3571
03:52:54,280 --> 03:52:55,220
Let's go get gas.

3572
03:52:57,080 --> 03:52:57,660
Is it this way?

3573
03:53:06,120 --> 03:53:06,560
Shortcut!

3574
03:53:12,750 --> 03:53:13,190
Shortcut!

3575
03:53:15,490 --> 03:53:15,750
Oops.

3576
03:53:19,660 --> 03:53:20,100
Shortcut!

3577
03:53:36,140 --> 03:53:37,620
50 cents in a dream.

3578
03:53:38,480 --> 03:53:41,400
I'm in a place where the only way to get pizza delivered is
through a breeze.

3579
03:53:41,660 --> 03:53:43,280
Oh, I just go pick it up.

3580
03:53:46,900 --> 03:53:54,740
because also you get like the pickup deals too you know
where it's like oh if you come in to get the pizza here

3581
03:53:54,740 --> 03:54:08,600
we'll give you a little bit off and I'm like hi dog I'll
take that low fuel uh oh guys we might be cooked what

3582
03:54:08,600 --> 03:54:14,640
happens if we're low fuel do they take all of our money and
fill it up I imagine that's That's probably how it works,

3583
03:54:14,760 --> 03:54:15,980
but we'll see.

3584
03:54:20,780 --> 03:54:22,800
I'm not going to Clifton, I'm going to Smelton!

3585
03:54:23,520 --> 03:54:23,720
See?

3586
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:30,360
We're okay, we're okay.

3587
03:54:32,980 --> 03:54:35,600
There could be some more signage though, Alguerrug.

3588
03:54:37,820 --> 03:54:39,100
I think we're almost there.

3589
03:54:39,380 --> 03:54:40,100
Wait, are we gonna make it?

3590
03:54:40,220 --> 03:54:40,380
Wait.

3591
03:54:43,000 --> 03:54:44,160
Oh, this is pizza.

3592
03:54:45,280 --> 03:54:46,640
Oh no, I went to pizza!

3593
03:54:55,390 --> 03:55:05,510
it's back here oh my gosh wait are we gonna make it you guys
will my mistake cost us will my mistake cost us oh

3594
03:55:09,180 --> 03:55:23,500
we're so close watch we die right in front of the gas
station that'd be crazy

3595
03:55:27,360 --> 03:55:31,980
holy cow we made it oh

3596
03:55:36,140 --> 03:55:40,180
come surely this will have no environmental impact.

3597
03:55:41,320 --> 03:55:42,940
I'd go over there and untie your shoes.

3598
03:55:43,280 --> 03:55:44,460
But you're not worth the effort.

3599
03:55:46,020 --> 03:55:46,520
That's...

3600
03:55:46,520 --> 03:55:47,640
Oh, only 39!

3601
03:55:49,420 --> 03:55:50,600
Oh, let's go!

3602
03:55:51,760 --> 03:55:53,540
Does that fill me up?

3603
03:55:55,820 --> 03:55:56,760
Let's go!

3604
03:55:57,080 --> 03:55:58,800
We didn't lose all of our money!

3605
03:56:01,820 --> 03:56:03,800
Wait, why was it sometimes $60?

3606
03:56:04,760 --> 03:56:06,040
Am I getting scammed?

3607
03:56:08,440 --> 03:56:08,960
Uh...

3608
03:56:09,180 --> 03:56:10,240
I think I was getting scammed.

3609
03:56:11,120 --> 03:56:12,600
Let's do Clifton to Dampton.

3610
03:56:17,160 --> 03:56:18,260
Pick up from bar.

3611
03:56:18,440 --> 03:56:19,420
Alright, I know where that is.

3612
03:56:19,520 --> 03:56:20,240
I know where that is.

3613
03:56:26,220 --> 03:56:26,700
Shortcut.

3614
03:56:38,390 --> 03:56:39,270
Loyalty bonus?

3615
03:56:39,550 --> 03:56:39,790
Maybe.

3616
03:56:41,210 --> 03:56:42,010
Good question.

3617
03:56:42,670 --> 03:56:44,290
Game is trying to scam me for real.

3618
03:56:45,630 --> 03:56:50,130
At least it doesn't have, like, surge pricing when I
desperately need fuel.

3619
03:56:51,390 --> 03:56:54,710
DoorDash dropped off four pizzas that I didn't order on my
driveway.

3620
03:56:55,090 --> 03:56:55,690
weeks ago.

3621
03:56:56,450 --> 03:56:58,370
I found out, called them, and they told me to keep them.

3622
03:56:58,490 --> 03:57:00,950
I got four pizzas, so worth of zero dollars.

3623
03:57:01,730 --> 03:57:01,890
Nice.

3624
03:57:03,070 --> 03:57:04,210
I wish that would happen to me.

3625
03:57:15,340 --> 03:57:17,920
Alright, Clifton, Clifton, Clifton.

3626
03:57:24,650 --> 03:57:25,390
There we are.

3627
03:57:26,990 --> 03:57:28,710
That's a hell yeah, brother.

3628
03:57:29,870 --> 03:57:31,370
Hell yeah, brother!

3629
03:57:33,870 --> 03:57:34,670
Free pizza.

3630
03:57:34,750 --> 03:57:34,930
What?

3631
03:57:35,010 --> 03:57:35,770
But, okay.

3632
03:57:36,010 --> 03:57:39,110
At the same time, though, I'm very picky about my pizza.

3633
03:57:40,150 --> 03:57:44,870
If it's not the kind of pizza that I want, I'll be like,
Peebza money.

3634
03:57:44,990 --> 03:57:46,170
Oh, Mr. Yaya!

3635
03:57:48,170 --> 03:57:49,010
Thank you.

3636
03:57:50,830 --> 03:57:51,730
Is this the bar?

3637
03:57:52,490 --> 03:57:53,310
Wait, where's the bar?

3638
03:57:54,190 --> 03:57:54,810
Are you the bar?

3639
03:57:56,330 --> 03:57:57,130
Pawn shop.

3640
03:57:57,590 --> 03:57:58,730
The prawn shop.

3641
03:58:00,190 --> 03:58:00,930
It's a weird story.

3642
03:58:01,010 --> 03:58:02,010
My four pizzas never...

3643
03:58:04,790 --> 03:58:05,250
Drama.

3644
03:58:11,440 --> 03:58:23,020
DRAMA OY Maybe I'm too hard on 6-0 Maybe life is all about
supporting the people you love Can't expect anything in

3645
03:58:23,020 --> 03:58:29,180
return One of the pizzas was ham, pineapple, and jalapeno
Ah, see, I wouldn't be able to eat that Yummy, but would you

3646
03:58:29,180 --> 03:58:29,880
be able to handle it?

3647
03:58:29,960 --> 03:58:31,020
I don't think so

3648
03:58:36,600 --> 03:58:37,940
What's a minto pizza?

3649
03:58:39,900 --> 03:58:41,480
Like Mostly veggie.

3650
03:58:44,020 --> 03:58:46,080
Us, uns, uns, uns, uns, uns.

3651
03:58:46,620 --> 03:58:48,940
Like, I'm a veggie pizza believer.

3652
03:58:49,900 --> 03:58:54,240
Wait, so if I go out this way, keep to the right.

3653
03:58:58,770 --> 03:58:59,950
Is this a road?

3654
03:59:02,150 --> 03:59:03,310
Oh, it is.

3655
03:59:03,410 --> 03:59:04,810
I didn't think this was a road.

3656
03:59:05,630 --> 03:59:07,110
Wait, maybe this is not a road.

3657
03:59:08,170 --> 03:59:08,350
Oh.

3658
03:59:11,910 --> 03:59:12,430
Oh.

3659
03:59:12,810 --> 03:59:13,130
Oops.

3660
03:59:13,570 --> 03:59:13,770
Oops.

3661
03:59:14,070 --> 03:59:14,350
Oops.

3662
03:59:15,650 --> 03:59:15,650
Oops.

3663
03:59:19,810 --> 03:59:20,370
Ah,

3664
03:59:24,820 --> 03:59:25,700
we're lost.

3665
03:59:27,520 --> 03:59:28,580
Wait, where am I?

3666
03:59:30,380 --> 03:59:31,980
Wait, I'm lost.

3667
03:59:34,320 --> 03:59:34,720
Leaving.

3668
03:59:35,200 --> 03:59:36,160
Oh, perfect.

3669
03:59:37,120 --> 03:59:38,120
We made it up.

3670
03:59:40,800 --> 03:59:42,340
What road did I take then?

3671
03:59:46,930 --> 03:59:48,470
We have no recovery.

3672
03:59:48,670 --> 03:59:50,930
We still have one left, so we're okay, I think.

3673

I love making Okay when I was a poor college student I would

3678
04:01:00,390 --> 04:01:03,070
make rice and then spinach.

3679
04:01:03,890 --> 04:01:09,170
I would cook spinach in sesame oil and have that over rice
and that would be my meal.

3680
04:01:12,650 --> 04:01:14,130
So yummy.

3681
04:01:14,890 --> 04:01:15,510
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

3682
04:01:17,790 --> 04:01:20,770
But like cooking the spinach in the sesame oil.

3683
04:01:21,390 --> 04:01:22,470
Just a tiny bit.

3684
04:01:22,550 --> 04:01:24,550
It would last me a long time.

3685
04:01:24,990 --> 04:01:27,090
I do enjoy a healthy amount of veggies on pizza.

3686
04:01:28,070 --> 04:01:28,670
New Year's Wish.

3687
04:01:29,230 --> 04:01:31,330
Maybe a playthrough of the PS2 Madagascar King.

04:01:31,430 --> 04:01:33,550

3689

Oh, garlic is a given, because I'm a garlic girl.

3694
04:01:43,650 --> 04:01:45,430
No, I, um...

3695
04:01:45,430 --> 04:01:48,030
I'm finishing Battle Block with Barry next week.

3696
04:01:50,330 --> 04:01:51,230
Yes, I am!

3697
04:01:55,180 --> 04:01:58,720
Clifton the Smallton, or Damton the Smallton.

3698
04:01:59,240 --> 04:02:02,200
This one, we are carrying it for a less amount of time.

3699
04:02:02,520 --> 04:02:08,020
Actually, I want to skip Clifton all together so let's do
the Damton to Smolton even though it's about the same amount

3700
04:02:08,020 --> 04:02:28,100
of money easy cafe okay which is where upper upper Dampton

3701
04:02:28,100 --> 04:02:32,780

of people this year asking for the mint cookies that don't

3702
04:02:32,780 --> 04:02:33,540
have mint.

3703
04:02:34,160 --> 04:02:35,400
They don't do VTubers.

3704
04:02:35,940 --> 04:02:36,560
Back here!

3705
04:02:37,020 --> 04:02:38,900
Oh my gosh, I feel like it's been a while.

3706
04:02:42,120 --> 04:02:43,680
I'm glad people like their recipe.

3707
04:02:46,100 --> 04:02:48,280
Why didn't you ask me to bless them this year, huh?

3708
04:02:53,050 --> 04:02:54,130
Where am I going?

3709
04:02:55,950 --> 04:02:57,250

04:02:59,710 --> 04:03:00,570

04:03:02,250 --> 04:03:03,070
Where am I?

3712
04:03:04,490 --> 04:03:05,670
I've been lurking.

3713
04:03:06,170 --> 04:03:06,610
I see.

3714
04:03:07,870 --> 04:03:09,330
Well, thanks for saying hi.

3715
04:03:11,530 --> 04:03:12,370
Thank you.

3716
04:03:13,730 --> 04:03:15,670
You know, I miss you guys when you don't comment.

3717
04:03:15,750 --> 04:03:18,070
Not to say that you can't lurk or anything, obviously.

3718
04:03:19,270 --> 04:03:21,050
But I do wonder about you guys, you know.

3719
04:03:21,490 --> 04:03:23,710
I'm like, hmm, I wonder where so-and-so is.

3720
04:03:24,930 --> 04:03:29,270
You might think, like, ah, she has such a big chat, she
doesn't notice.

3721
04:03:30,230 --> 04:03:30,870
But I do.

3722
04:03:31,750 --> 04:03:34,070
I probably see a lot more than you guys realize.

3723
04:03:37,230 --> 04:03:39,910
Dusty dog, thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

3724
04:03:41,510 --> 04:03:44,410
Jars of Christopher Ranch chopped garlic is yummy.

3725
04:03:45,190 --> 04:03:45,990
Christopher Ranch.

3726
04:03:46,470 --> 04:03:48,930
Are you sure that, wait, is that ranch or is it garlic?

3727
04:03:50,210 --> 04:03:51,690
She's stalking us.

3728
04:03:59,050 --> 04:03:59,990
Is that a threat?

3729
04:04:00,190 --> 04:04:00,490
Maybe.

3730
04:04:02,410 --> 04:04:02,770
Maybe.

3731
04:04:05,110 --> 04:04:09,570
Like I see when you, when, I see your posts.

3732
04:04:09,890 --> 04:04:11,630
I see when you Ashi-hen!

3733
04:04:15,740 --> 04:04:17,180
Fancy seeing you here.

3734
04:04:18,280 --> 04:04:21,880
Every once in a while I wonder whether I should be flirting
with everyone I meet.

3735
04:04:21,980 --> 04:04:24,300
Wait a second, they're not behind the counter anymore.

3736
04:04:25,420 --> 04:04:28,460
But then I remember everyone I meet is incredibly
attractive.

3737
04:04:31,140 --> 04:04:32,780
Oh, oh my god!

3738
04:04:34,040 --> 04:04:34,800
Thank you.

3739
04:04:40,040 --> 04:04:40,820
All right.

3740
04:04:42,140 --> 04:04:43,360
Is it Oshi Henning?

3741
04:04:43,540 --> 04:04:44,660
If it's Densitou EXE?

3742
04:04:44,740 --> 04:04:45,100
No!

3743
04:04:46,060 --> 04:04:48,300
Of course you can Oshi...

3744
04:04:48,300 --> 04:04:49,140
Oshi Densitou.

3745
04:04:49,900 --> 04:04:50,460
Yubi!

3746
04:04:50,540 --> 04:04:51,540
Thank you for the membership!

3747
04:04:52,040 --> 04:04:52,920
Welcome, welcome!

3748
04:04:54,500 --> 04:04:56,200
Let's see, we're going to...

3749
04:04:57,900 --> 04:04:59,400
Right by pizza.

3750
04:05:00,120 --> 04:05:01,040
Alright, let's go to pizza.

3751
04:05:03,700 --> 04:05:04,620
Don't mind that.

3752
04:05:06,880 --> 04:05:09,640
Crackers, cheese, and various deli meats is called girl
dinner.

3753
04:05:09,640 --> 04:05:16,060
but I thought it was called charcuterie no I don't think
that's girl dinner at all because that sounds like an actual

3754
04:05:16,060 --> 04:05:21,100
like that's like something you actually eat that's like
that's a meal you know what I mean a girl dinner would be

3755
04:05:21,100 --> 04:05:37,220
like cheese and ham and like like a cold pizza um uh like
fruit snacks yeah girl dinner's more fair yeah yeah I just

3756
04:05:37,220 --> 04:05:40,920
forgot to do my monthly Do your dailies.

3757
04:05:41,460 --> 04:05:43,100
Remember, Ibu, she knows when you're sleeping.

3758
04:05:43,560 --> 04:05:43,820
Yeah.

3759
04:05:44,740 --> 04:05:45,280
I know.

3760
04:05:49,020 --> 04:05:50,220
I feel called out.

3761
04:05:53,720 --> 04:05:54,920
Wait, is it this way?

3762
04:05:56,160 --> 04:05:57,140
I think so?

3763
04:06:01,780 --> 04:06:02,300
Yes.

3764
04:06:03,260 --> 04:06:04,780
To Clifton, Smolton.

3765
04:06:07,500 --> 04:06:09,740
I feel very called out by your desperation.

3766
04:06:10,860 --> 04:06:11,400
Girl dinner.

3767
04:06:12,120 --> 04:06:14,500
Then you understand, you know, girl dinner.

3768
04:06:16,000 --> 04:06:28,060
what is the opposite what is like a boy dinner i imagine
like meats or something you know i don't know like bacon and

3769
04:06:28,060 --> 04:06:41,700
hams and sausages nuggets oh that's also part of girl dinner
though i believe pizza maybe it's maybe it's not so

3770
04:06:41,700 --> 04:06:46,520
different term girl dinner then You know, maybe we're all
not that different after all.

3771
04:06:48,240 --> 04:06:49,580
Boys and girls.

3772
04:06:50,840 --> 04:06:52,720
Maybe we're all just the same.

3773
04:06:53,440 --> 04:06:55,160
A little silly.

3774
04:07:01,310 --> 04:07:02,610
Eyes on the road.

3775
04:07:03,050 --> 04:07:04,130
I'm a responsible driver.

3776
04:07:12,420 --> 04:07:15,420
I looked away for two seconds.

3777
04:07:30,080 --> 04:07:31,320
Nice and easy.

3778
04:07:38,730 --> 04:07:41,790
Sorry if I miss your super chill messages.

3779
04:07:43,350 --> 04:07:43,910
But thank you guys.

3780
04:07:44,110 --> 04:07:45,910
Thank you so, so, so much.

3781
04:07:46,170 --> 04:07:46,370
Thank you.

3782
04:07:47,530 --> 04:07:48,630
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3783
04:07:51,270 --> 04:07:53,850
All right, we're headed to pizza, but not exactly pizza.

3784
04:07:55,910 --> 04:07:59,430
All right, hopefully we can get in a few more deliveries
to...

3785
04:08:00,470 --> 04:08:01,990
Hopefully it doesn't take very long.

3786
04:08:05,310 --> 04:08:07,890
Wait, oh, shoot.

3787
04:08:08,710 --> 04:08:11,170
I think boy dinner is one Rubik's Cube with ranch.

3788
04:08:13,430 --> 04:08:14,350
Oh, delicacy.

3789
04:08:15,610 --> 04:08:15,950
Yay!

3790
04:08:18,630 --> 04:08:21,570
About a year ago, I asked if it was going to use your
karaoke songs for a custom art.

3791
04:08:21,650 --> 04:08:22,090
Yes!

3792
04:08:22,330 --> 04:08:25,310
I was wondering if you could bless me again to make another
one.

3793
04:08:25,810 --> 04:08:27,930
Wait, wait, wait, of what?

3794
04:08:28,130 --> 04:08:28,550
Of what?

3795
04:08:33,950 --> 04:08:36,030
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

3796
04:08:36,250 --> 04:08:36,410
Wait.

3797
04:08:39,430 --> 04:08:41,810
where is this

3798
04:08:47,920 --> 04:08:51,480
no watching chat while driving sorry

3799
04:08:56,840 --> 04:08:58,890
I think it's this way maybe

3800
04:09:02,660 --> 04:09:12,800
yes yes I didn't even know there was a road back here aha

3801
04:09:19,510 --> 04:09:23,190
and wait where to go oh Oh no.

3802
04:09:23,830 --> 04:09:24,310
Wait.

3803
04:09:25,870 --> 04:09:26,330
Place.

3804
04:09:29,690 --> 04:09:30,170
Oh gosh.

3805
04:09:30,970 --> 04:09:31,230
Oh gosh.

3806
04:09:31,710 --> 04:09:31,710
Oh gosh.

3807
04:09:31,990 --> 04:09:31,990
Oh gosh.

3808
04:09:32,350 --> 04:09:32,350
Oh gosh.

3809
04:09:33,590 --> 04:09:33,770
Okay.

3810
04:09:35,010 --> 04:09:36,290
Another custom vinyl.

3811
04:09:36,430 --> 04:09:37,510
Yeah, but what's on?

3812
04:09:38,210 --> 04:09:39,170
Of course you can.

3813
04:09:39,890 --> 04:09:40,450
Of course.

3814
04:09:40,850 --> 04:09:41,790
Of course you can.

3815
04:09:42,010 --> 04:09:42,950
But I'm just curious.

3816
04:09:46,990 --> 04:09:51,110
My cheap college go-to is making kind of scrambled or sunny
side eggs with hot sauce.

3817
04:09:51,190 --> 04:09:52,390
But that's not so cheap anymore.

3818
04:09:52,450 --> 04:09:54,130
Yeah, the eggy.

3819
04:09:55,650 --> 04:09:56,250
The eggy.

3820
04:09:59,050 --> 04:10:01,370
How much money do I have?

3821
04:10:03,890 --> 04:10:06,390
We're in Smolton now, right?

3822
04:10:08,070 --> 04:10:11,330
Let's do Smolton the Dampton is so far!

3823
04:10:13,810 --> 04:10:14,610
I

3824
04:10:18,860 --> 04:10:21,220
think I gotta do Clifton the Dampton.

3825
04:10:22,900 --> 04:10:24,740
Gotta focus on the big money.

3826
04:10:26,700 --> 04:10:27,480
pawn shop.

3827
04:10:27,980 --> 04:10:27,980
Okay.

3828
04:10:29,240 --> 04:10:30,180
I'm at $73.

3829
04:10:35,080 --> 04:10:36,500
I'm sick of this area.

3830
04:10:36,820 --> 04:10:37,520
I'm not gonna lie.

3831
04:10:39,040 --> 04:10:41,120
Can I just drive over the rocks?

3832
04:10:50,380 --> 04:10:50,900
Hmm.

3833
04:10:53,720 --> 04:10:58,000
I have a line on the list, but I'm thinking the jazz karaoke
stream is a start.

3834
04:10:59,040 --> 04:11:00,740
Yeah, of course.

3835
04:11:02,080 --> 04:11:02,840
Ram the gate.

3836
04:11:03,000 --> 04:11:03,560
It doesn't work.

3837
04:11:03,680 --> 04:11:04,700
I need the gate thing.

3838
04:11:04,800 --> 04:11:07,480
That's why I'm Saving up $100 for...

3839
04:11:09,520 --> 04:11:12,380
Unfortunately, I cannot ram the gate yet.

3840
04:11:13,480 --> 04:11:15,920
Ugh, it's kind of torture this area.

3841
04:11:19,560 --> 04:11:21,020
Okay, so we're going to Clifton.

3842
04:11:27,740 --> 04:11:31,700
Well, if the one from Smolton wasn't such small money, then
I would have taken it.

3843
04:11:31,980 --> 04:11:36,660
But I think we just need to do two more big jobs and then
we'll be good to go to buy it.

3844
04:11:41,560 --> 04:11:50,980
Oh, this part is, this kind of drags the, it's like so mean
that they give you such small bucks in this area.

3845
04:11:52,980 --> 04:11:54,020
Yeah, I do need coffee.

3846
04:11:54,140 --> 04:11:54,680
Don't worry.

3847
04:11:54,800 --> 04:11:56,500
Once we get out, I'll drink some.

3848
04:11:58,840 --> 04:12:01,100
I'll drink some inside the pawn shop.

3849
04:12:01,900 --> 04:12:03,080
It is the pawn shop.

3850
04:12:05,970 --> 04:12:06,290
Right?

3851
04:12:06,570 --> 04:12:07,050
Clifton.

3852
04:12:13,510 --> 04:12:16,210
It says there's a tunnel back, but I don't know.

3853
04:12:16,230 --> 04:12:17,210
I don't know if it'll work.

3854
04:12:18,750 --> 04:12:19,850
Oh, here it is.

3855
04:12:21,890 --> 04:12:23,970
Go, go, go, go, enter, enter, enter.

3856
04:12:24,090 --> 04:12:24,510
There we go.

3857
04:12:31,860 --> 04:12:37,440
I've done my own research on these deliveries and I've
determined that they definitely contain something suspicious

3858
04:12:37,440 --> 04:12:38,520
like cardboard.

3859
04:12:41,060 --> 04:12:42,020
Where do me this, Minto?

3860
04:12:42,140 --> 04:12:45,080
Which part of a road do ghosts love to travel the most?

3861
04:13:07,640 --> 04:13:08,300
The sidewalk?

3862
04:13:22,760 --> 04:13:23,200
Dead?

3863
04:13:24,060 --> 04:13:24,520
Ends!

3864
04:13:27,520 --> 04:13:29,240
You guys are so silly.

3865
04:13:34,380 --> 04:13:36,560
I don't like, I don't know how to get out of Clifton.

3866
04:13:36,760 --> 04:13:39,100
You got, oh no, Dampton is like on the ice.

3867
04:13:47,730 --> 04:13:49,610
Can I pay, buy it and then...

3868
04:13:52,390 --> 04:13:54,790
Then give you the money, the rest of it later?

3869
04:13:55,730 --> 04:13:57,990
Just fast travel, if only, right?

3870
04:13:58,970 --> 04:14:00,270
I think it's this one.

3871
04:14:09,330 --> 04:14:10,150
Was this the road?

3872
04:14:15,360 --> 04:14:16,620
Here we go!

3873
04:14:18,060 --> 04:14:18,540
Shortcut.

3874
04:14:23,300 --> 04:14:25,600
Are you breaking the law for not strapping down my load?

3875
04:14:25,900 --> 04:14:26,280
No!

3876
04:14:26,980 --> 04:14:27,940
Wait, where am I?

3877
04:14:28,360 --> 04:14:29,200
Obviously, no.

3878
04:14:30,100 --> 04:14:30,540
Oh my god.

3879
04:14:30,740 --> 04:14:31,220
Oh my god.

3880
04:14:31,940 --> 04:14:32,480
We're two.

3881
04:14:44,530 --> 04:14:45,090
We're too good.

3882
04:14:45,230 --> 04:14:46,230
We're too good.

3883
04:14:49,170 --> 04:14:51,970
I'm glad this game ended up not being super spooky, though.

3884
04:14:52,950 --> 04:14:54,170
It's kind of nice.

3885
04:14:54,530 --> 04:14:56,270
It's like, it's pretty good.

3886
04:14:59,550 --> 04:14:59,970
Alright.

3887
04:15:00,310 --> 04:15:02,810
I don't like that it shows me...

3888
04:15:02,810 --> 04:15:03,050
Oh.

3889
04:15:03,890 --> 04:15:06,930
It shows me the delivery thing, but like...

3890
04:15:06,930 --> 04:15:09,230
It's always on the left side, so it's kind of confusing.

3891
04:15:10,210 --> 04:15:11,730
Because it's like...

3892
04:15:11,730 --> 04:15:13,970
I wish it just showed me where to go.

3893
04:15:14,070 --> 04:15:14,510
You know what I mean?

3894
04:15:14,530 --> 04:15:17,830
Oh, see, it's getting big again.

3895
04:15:18,710 --> 04:15:19,070
Uh-oh.

3896
04:15:19,710 --> 04:15:20,610
Oh, oh.

3897
04:15:20,830 --> 04:15:21,070
Ah!

3898
04:15:24,630 --> 04:15:25,790
How do I do this?

3899
04:15:28,610 --> 04:15:28,970
Eh?

3900
04:15:29,710 --> 04:15:31,130
I don't know where it is.

3901
04:15:36,650 --> 04:15:37,110
Oh!

3902
04:15:37,670 --> 04:15:38,970
I see it down here.

3903
04:15:42,350 --> 04:15:42,890
Ah.

3904
04:15:43,670 --> 04:15:45,870
I thought it was one of these places on the water.

3905
04:15:50,610 --> 04:15:51,150
Nice.

3910
04:16:45,470 --> 04:16:46,170
Easy cafe.

3911
04:16:50,450 --> 04:16:52,010
Over here, right?

3912
04:16:54,810 --> 04:16:55,410
Depot.

3913
04:16:57,450 --> 04:16:57,990
Bakery.

3914
04:17:03,900 --> 04:17:04,840
Oh, it's up there!

3915
04:17:05,080 --> 04:17:06,240
Oh, I missed it.

3916
04:17:11,180 --> 04:17:12,820
Hold on, I'm getting my bearings.

3917
04:17:13,800 --> 04:17:15,060
Yes, I must go straight.

3918
04:17:17,780 --> 04:17:18,280
Hey, Minky.

3919
04:17:18,600 --> 04:17:18,900
Hello!

3920
04:17:21,040 --> 04:17:22,680
The road to $100.

3921
04:17:23,220 --> 04:17:24,860
We're so close.

3922
04:17:25,180 --> 04:17:27,460
I'm going to forget about the rod for now.

3923
04:17:27,580 --> 04:17:30,100
I'm not even going to think about it.

3924
04:17:31,360 --> 04:17:32,620
It's over here, right?

3925
04:17:37,460 --> 04:17:38,600
Easy, cafe.

3926
04:17:42,390 --> 04:17:44,110
Yeah, it's so much money.

3927
04:17:44,370 --> 04:17:45,710
The rod.

3928
04:17:48,350 --> 04:17:49,310
Me don't know money.

3929
04:17:49,650 --> 04:17:50,450
That's me.

3930
04:17:51,730 --> 04:17:52,810
Fancy seeing you here.

3931
04:17:52,990 --> 04:17:53,370
Oh my gosh.

3932
04:17:54,310 --> 04:17:55,490
Are you gonna...

3933
04:17:55,490 --> 04:18:00,710
If we were binary code, I'd be a zero because you're the
only one I need.

3934
04:18:01,450 --> 04:18:03,030
That's how binary works, right?

3935
04:18:04,290 --> 04:18:04,810
Sure.

3936
04:18:08,010 --> 04:18:11,370
Is it a fishing minigame that you get when you...

3937
04:18:12,390 --> 04:18:13,390
All right, let's see.

3938
04:18:13,450 --> 04:18:14,250
Where am I at?

3939
04:18:18,010 --> 04:18:19,010
We were what?

3940
04:18:19,350 --> 04:18:19,710
Around here?

3941
04:18:20,530 --> 04:18:21,150
Like a shortcut.

3942
04:18:24,450 --> 04:18:26,270
What do you mean a cooler car?

3943
04:18:26,910 --> 04:18:28,130
This is a K truck.

3944
04:18:29,010 --> 04:18:30,870
It's like, oh, that's what we need.

3945
04:18:39,940 --> 04:18:40,360
Oh.

3946
04:18:40,800 --> 04:18:41,560
Let's go.

3947
04:18:45,730 --> 04:18:47,450
This is all we need.

3948
04:18:57,820 --> 04:18:58,240
Everybody!

3949
04:18:58,860 --> 04:18:59,160
Two.

3950
04:19:01,040 --> 04:19:02,040
Oh, my goodness.

3951
04:19:02,620 --> 04:19:03,840
And we have a little despair.

3952
04:19:03,860 --> 04:19:13,440
in case I need, I think I still have, um, I still have one
cup of coffee, I'm pretty sure.

3953
04:19:14,960 --> 04:19:18,240
Alright, it's a snowstorm, but no worries.

3954
04:19:22,950 --> 04:19:25,650
Maybe we'll get big buck deliveries after this.

3955
04:19:27,170 --> 04:19:28,250
Everything will be good.

3956
04:19:33,410 --> 04:19:34,470
I hope so.

3957
04:19:39,530 --> 04:19:41,030
Oh, everything's not good.

3958
04:19:43,270 --> 04:19:45,850
You just had to add the fa- Oh no.

3959
04:19:49,130 --> 04:19:50,250
This way.

3960
04:19:53,060 --> 04:19:54,040
Oh, wrong way.

3961
04:19:58,480 --> 04:20:01,080
Here I thought we were going to get eaten up by...

3962
04:20:04,440 --> 04:20:05,560
By, uh...

3963
04:20:05,560 --> 04:20:05,940
You know.

3964
04:20:09,370 --> 04:20:10,210
The water.

3965
04:20:12,590 --> 04:20:13,530
Sick tricks.

3966
04:20:13,650 --> 04:20:14,150
Thank you.

3967
04:20:14,830 --> 04:20:15,670
I'm full of them?

3968
04:20:15,830 --> 04:20:16,650
I'm full of them.

3969
04:20:19,230 --> 04:20:20,190
Where am I?

3970
04:20:21,370 --> 04:20:23,370
Oh, I don't recognize this area.

3971
04:20:29,940 --> 04:20:31,080
Okay, here we go.

3972
04:20:32,000 --> 04:20:32,460
What?

3973
04:20:32,980 --> 04:20:33,440
Yes.

3974
04:20:33,760 --> 04:20:34,740
Alright, we're right here.

3975
04:20:35,940 --> 04:20:38,480
I'm full of sick and I'm full of tricks.

3976
04:20:39,540 --> 04:20:41,820
And by sick, I mean sick in the head.

3977
04:20:49,640 --> 04:20:51,040
Give me that bumper bar.

3978
04:20:52,020 --> 04:20:52,840
Give it to me.

3979
04:20:53,040 --> 04:20:53,180
Oh?

3980
04:20:54,180 --> 04:20:55,420
Hey, not Seb, guys.

3981
04:20:56,020 --> 04:20:57,580
Wait, what is he gonna tell us?

3982
04:20:57,960 --> 04:20:58,920
I'm remembering.

3983
04:21:00,740 --> 04:21:03,760
I put some more air in those tires if I were you.

3984
04:21:05,180 --> 04:21:05,860
Actually, never mind.

3985
04:21:06,120 --> 04:21:07,000
We're all out of air.

3986
04:21:08,360 --> 04:21:09,100
Bumper bars.

3987
04:21:09,620 --> 04:21:11,100
These will let you smash through things.

3988
04:21:11,720 --> 04:21:13,200
That will cost...

3989
04:21:13,200 --> 04:21:14,260
Oh, it's painful.

3990
04:21:20,980 --> 04:21:21,480
No air.

3991
04:21:23,140 --> 04:21:24,420
Breathing no air.

3992
04:21:25,120 --> 04:21:27,020
No air, no air, no air.

3993
04:21:27,760 --> 04:21:29,180
What am I supposed to do with these again?

3994
04:21:29,880 --> 04:21:32,540
I did it.

3995
04:21:33,300 --> 04:21:36,320
Infiltrate the hydro dam in Fishing Town and retrieve the
supplies.

3996
04:21:36,760 --> 04:21:38,020
Oh, where is that?

3997
04:21:39,060 --> 04:21:39,660
Oh, wait.

3998
04:21:42,120 --> 04:21:43,720
Let's have our last thing of coffee.

3999
04:21:45,460 --> 04:21:48,500
How do I recycle these cans, then?

4000
04:21:52,560 --> 04:21:54,740
Wait, so I can smash their trees and things?

4001
04:21:57,000 --> 04:21:58,040
Oh, liars.

4002
04:21:59,280 --> 04:21:59,780
Just kidding.

4003
04:22:01,720 --> 04:22:03,260
We're taking them out.

4004
04:22:03,560 --> 04:22:04,100
Taking them out.

4005
04:22:06,400 --> 04:22:06,900
Uh.

4006
04:22:11,320 --> 04:22:13,430
Now where is the place I need to go?

4007
04:22:15,460 --> 04:22:17,000
Is it the tunnel?

4008
04:22:17,320 --> 04:22:17,520
Maybe.

4009
04:22:19,640 --> 04:22:23,060
Your driving gives me war flashbacks of Chicago joke.

4010
04:22:25,620 --> 04:22:26,640
Maybe here.

4011
04:22:26,740 --> 04:22:27,720
Tunnel to.

4012
04:22:29,620 --> 04:22:29,980
Oh.

4013
04:22:30,820 --> 04:22:31,500
Uh.

4014
04:22:31,800 --> 04:22:32,500
Probably.

4015
04:22:32,680 --> 04:22:34,320
to them, damn.

4016
04:22:37,880 --> 04:22:39,400
Tunnel to...

4017
04:22:39,400 --> 04:22:40,820
Oh, Mountain Town!

4018
04:22:41,000 --> 04:22:41,260
Wait!

4019
04:22:42,160 --> 04:22:44,580
Could I have gotten back to Mountain Town this whole time?

4020
04:22:48,660 --> 04:22:49,420
No.

4021
04:22:50,700 --> 04:22:51,140
No.

4022
04:22:52,340 --> 04:22:52,540
No.

4023
04:23:02,910 --> 04:23:04,990
Oh, okay, okay.

4024
04:23:07,310 --> 04:23:07,570
Oh!

4025
04:23:09,570 --> 04:23:11,670
That would have been so...

4026
04:23:11,670 --> 04:23:12,090
horrible.

4027
04:23:13,810 --> 04:23:14,450
Shortcut.

4028
04:23:24,560 --> 04:23:25,600
I'm unstoppable!

4029
04:23:34,680 --> 04:23:37,000
I think this is taking us to Smalton.

4030
04:23:41,960 --> 04:23:43,680
And then we can bash through.

4031
04:23:43,940 --> 04:23:44,320
Yeah.

4032
04:23:45,240 --> 04:23:46,340
And get to Damton.

4033
04:23:47,000 --> 04:23:48,380
I wonder if the Damton...

4034
04:23:48,380 --> 04:23:51,780
Oh, I wonder if in between that gate is where we need to go.

4035
04:23:52,860 --> 04:23:53,380
Probably.

4036
04:23:54,400 --> 04:23:55,340
Oh, probably.

4037
04:23:57,880 --> 04:24:09,100
I was thinking for some reason that it was Oh, it's hard to
say That maybe It like was just There was nothing in between

4038
04:24:09,100 --> 04:24:14,860
But there probably is something in between these guys Yeah,
oh, that was a little tough

4039
04:24:18,910 --> 04:24:24,470
Yeah, oh, I think I'm here Enter

4040
04:24:35,860 --> 04:24:37,520
Sick flip Thank you.

4041
04:24:37,640 --> 04:24:38,660
Yeah, we stuck that landing.

4042
04:24:38,840 --> 04:24:39,480
Checks, max.

4043
04:24:39,740 --> 04:24:40,360
Welcome to Babusha.

4044
04:24:40,740 --> 04:24:41,640
Thank you.

4045
04:24:42,820 --> 04:24:43,920
Through the fence, baby.

4046
04:24:44,920 --> 04:24:45,400
Oh, yeah.

4047
04:24:46,520 --> 04:24:47,440
La, la, la, la, la.

4048
04:24:47,520 --> 04:24:50,400
What if it's like the downstairs that I see when I die?

4049
04:24:52,840 --> 04:24:53,680
What if?

4050
04:24:59,480 --> 04:25:02,220
Oh, what's happening?

4051
04:25:13,300 --> 04:25:14,260
I'm scared.

4052
04:25:24,990 --> 04:25:27,350
It was a little unnerving down here.

4053
04:25:28,130 --> 04:25:29,370
Oh, it's a little spooky.

4054
04:25:30,870 --> 04:25:36,130
You guys know that gif of, like, that bunny cat character
that's, like...

4055
04:25:37,470 --> 04:25:40,570
That's, like, walking with a lighter or something through a
cave.

4056
04:25:41,030 --> 04:25:43,410
That's what, honestly, I thought this game reminded me of.

4057
04:25:45,950 --> 04:25:46,150
Hello?

4058
04:25:46,610 --> 04:25:46,970

Wait, am I gonna give this to a friend?

4062
04:25:53,970 --> 04:25:54,510
Go in?

4063
04:25:55,990 --> 04:25:56,330
Hello?

4064
04:25:57,090 --> 04:25:57,530

Yeah, yeah.

4068
04:26:08,680 --> 04:26:09,080
Um.

4069
04:26:14,950 --> 04:26:16,030
It's 12 a.m.

4070
04:26:16,030 --> 04:26:17,750
Yeah, and the time isn't changing.

4071
04:26:23,500 --> 04:26:24,300
Oh, hello.

4072
04:26:24,760 --> 04:26:25,500
Uh, hi.

4073
04:26:26,660 --> 04:26:28,040
Welcome back, Sombusters.

4074
04:26:28,220 --> 04:26:29,720
Thank you very much.

4075
04:26:30,260 --> 04:26:32,820
This has dog facing the dark doorway vibes.

4076
04:26:33,160 --> 04:26:33,380
Ew!

4077
04:26:35,320 --> 04:26:36,280
Oh, there we go.

4078
04:26:36,360 --> 04:26:36,560
Fine.

4079
04:26:36,860 --> 04:26:38,360
It's important to let me enter before.

4080
04:26:43,900 --> 04:26:44,820
That's a good old DFT.

4081
04:26:44,920 --> 04:26:45,380
Welcome back.

4082
04:26:45,740 --> 04:26:46,120
Thank you!

4083
04:26:50,020 --> 04:26:51,880
Why is the time not moving?

4084
04:26:55,960 --> 04:26:57,660
There was a path on the bottom screen?

4085
04:26:57,840 --> 04:26:58,260
There was!

4086
04:27:02,000 --> 04:27:02,860
Wait, was there?

4087
04:27:06,240 --> 04:27:07,520
Did I miss it?

4088
04:27:28,000 --> 04:27:30,680
Bring up the supplies to MK at the security gate.

4089
04:27:31,360 --> 04:27:33,600
I think it's just the walkie because that's what it shows.

4090
04:27:34,420 --> 04:27:35,060
I think that's it.

4091
04:27:46,930 --> 04:27:49,430
Oh, I'm so glad that the weather is cleared up.

4092
04:27:50,850 --> 04:27:51,910
It's so hard to see.

4093
04:27:53,010 --> 04:27:53,930
I'll be having a good Christmas.

4094
04:27:54,070 --> 04:27:55,370
You too, Artemis.

4095
04:27:55,490 --> 04:27:56,130
Thank you.

4096
04:27:56,910 --> 04:27:58,990
Thank you for 14 months.

4097
04:27:59,170 --> 04:28:00,210
Thank you, thank you.

4098
04:28:01,210 --> 04:28:02,090
The walkies.

4099
04:28:06,800 --> 04:28:07,740
Love the goose shirt.

4100
04:28:09,780 --> 04:28:11,060
I hate the ghost.

4101
04:28:14,100 --> 04:28:14,580
Goost.

4102
04:28:15,480 --> 04:28:16,360
Talk to me, Goost.

4103
04:28:18,440 --> 04:28:18,660
Wait.

4104
04:28:19,920 --> 04:28:21,480
Go back, go back, go back.

4105
04:28:22,440 --> 04:28:22,860
Beep.

4106
04:28:23,700 --> 04:28:24,180
Beep.

4107
04:28:24,560 --> 04:28:24,760
Beep.

4108
04:28:26,380 --> 04:28:27,280
Go Clifton.

4109
04:28:28,000 --> 04:28:29,000
Never play Bioshock.

4110
04:28:29,260 --> 04:28:30,160
I haven't.

4111
04:28:30,840 --> 04:28:31,580
That's another class.

4112
04:28:31,600 --> 04:28:33,000
Actually, I'm going to add that to my list.

4113
04:28:33,060 --> 04:28:36,360
Because that's another classic game that I've, like, always
wanted to play.

4114
04:28:39,200 --> 04:28:40,740
So many classics.

4115
04:28:42,220 --> 04:28:43,500
Never played at the time.

4116
04:28:53,810 --> 04:28:55,030
Bioshock playthrough.

4117
04:28:55,570 --> 04:29:01,930
Yeah, I added to the list of beep, beep, beep of all the
other games that I've...

4118
04:29:01,930 --> 04:29:05,870
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, backwards, backwards,
backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards,

4119
04:29:07,010 --> 04:29:13,450
backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards,
backwards, backwards, backwards, backwards.

4120
04:29:17,010 --> 04:29:18,530
Okay, we're okay.

4121
04:29:20,410 --> 04:29:20,930
Yeah.

4122
04:29:23,330 --> 04:29:25,630
Tunnel of love.

4123
04:29:29,740 --> 04:29:32,920
Lord of shadows, welcome to Prambusha.

4124
04:29:33,180 --> 04:29:33,800
Thank you!

4125
04:29:35,820 --> 04:29:37,180
Thank you, thank you.

4126
04:29:46,290 --> 04:29:46,650
Hello!

4127
04:29:50,670 --> 04:29:51,270
Great.

4128
04:29:51,650 --> 04:29:53,050
You've got the handheld radios.

4129
04:29:54,050 --> 04:29:55,290
I just finished with the gate.

4130
04:29:55,810 --> 04:29:57,110
It'll stay open for good now.

4131
04:29:57,510 --> 04:29:57,670
Yay!

4132
04:29:58,730 --> 04:30:00,190
Hearing Bioshock called Classic.

4133
04:30:00,370 --> 04:30:01,090
That day, baby.

4134
04:30:01,250 --> 04:30:02,330
Hitching to a gift.

4135
04:30:02,750 --> 04:30:04,770
Twenty months of it already feels like yesterday.

4136
04:30:05,530 --> 04:30:07,450
Thank you so much, legendary tilapia.

4137
04:30:07,650 --> 04:30:08,270
Thank you.

4138
04:30:08,710 --> 04:30:10,170
Mmm, tilapia, yummy.

4139
04:30:11,510 --> 04:30:12,450
Happy holiday, mint.

4140
04:30:12,590 --> 04:30:13,610
Oh, we'll be on a good one.

4141
04:30:13,690 --> 04:30:15,030
You too, Shadow Demon Lord.

4142
04:30:15,230 --> 04:30:15,970
Thank you, thank you.

4143
04:30:16,510 --> 04:30:17,550
Thank you so much.

04:30:18,310 --> 04:30:18,530
Jesse!

4145
04:30:20,110 --> 04:30:21,170
Thank you for the five gift.

4146
04:30:23,170 --> 04:30:24,790
Thank you for your help so far.

4147
04:30:25,010 --> 04:30:26,430
I guess I owe you an explanation.

04:30:30,690 --> 04:30:39,550

to keep going and to keep me going I know a way to help them

Well, we can't get the big jobs now, so...

4162
04:31:59,860 --> 04:32:00,800
I think it'll be okay.

4163
04:32:01,680 --> 04:32:03,920
Can I help keep your grip on ice?

4164
04:32:04,360 --> 04:32:04,700
Okay.

Snowy peaks.

4169
04:32:23,060 --> 04:32:23,500

04:33:01,970 --> 04:33:03,110
It's been so long.

4174

4194
04:33:56,820 --> 04:33:57,880
Where's my car?

4195
04:33:59,260 --> 04:34:00,300
Oh, okay, thank goodness.

4196
04:34:06,560 --> 04:34:07,780
Oh, down here.

4197
04:34:07,800 --> 04:34:12,100
Okay, so we have to go back to Clifton.

4198
04:34:14,540 --> 04:34:16,100
While eating pumpkin pie.

4199
04:34:16,600 --> 04:34:17,860
I want pumpkin pie.

4200
04:34:20,120 --> 04:34:21,660
Oh, I want pumpkin pie.

4201
04:34:23,120 --> 04:34:24,340
I want pumpkin pie.

4202
04:34:27,800 --> 04:34:29,620
Okay, Clifton is not far.

4203
04:34:29,840 --> 04:34:30,900
Mmm, pumpkin pie.

4204
04:34:32,540 --> 04:34:34,860
Wait, this is like such a long delivery.

4205
04:34:35,740 --> 04:34:38,260
Okay, but we only have to do a couple of them maybe.

4206
04:34:40,260 --> 04:34:43,160
And Easy Mart is...

4207
04:34:43,160 --> 04:34:43,440
Here!

4208
04:34:45,320 --> 04:34:46,300
Do, rift, do!

4209
04:34:51,480 --> 04:34:53,280
Have you had a sweet potato pie?

4210
04:34:53,380 --> 04:34:55,460
Okay, yes, but...

4211
04:34:56,240 --> 04:34:56,700
Hey, mate.

4212
04:34:57,820 --> 04:35:00,460
I've been training myself to eliminate...

4213
04:35:03,340 --> 04:35:05,000
Chlorofluorocarbons from the air I breathe.

4214
04:35:05,760 --> 04:35:07,900
So that I can begin to repair the ozone layer.

4215
04:35:10,200 --> 04:35:11,460
Can I buy...

4216
04:35:11,460 --> 04:35:12,020
Okay, no.

4217
04:35:13,020 --> 04:35:15,020
I'm gonna need more coffee soon.

4218
04:35:19,230 --> 04:35:20,110
For now, though, I'm okay.

4219
04:35:22,210 --> 04:35:22,470
Uh-oh.

4220
04:35:22,670 --> 04:35:23,770
Am I gonna lose my payload?

4221
04:35:27,410 --> 04:35:28,190
Nah, we're fine.

4222
04:35:32,850 --> 04:35:33,990
Everyone, go watch chat.

4223
04:35:34,090 --> 04:35:34,870
Where's my car?

4224
04:35:35,890 --> 04:35:36,290
Stop.

4225
04:35:39,010 --> 04:35:41,010
Thank you for the silver chat, boy.

4226
04:35:43,870 --> 04:35:44,590
Quit it.

4227
04:35:44,770 --> 04:35:46,010
Oh, we just lost another one.

4228
04:35:46,550 --> 04:35:47,190
Don't worry about it.

4229
04:35:47,210 --> 04:35:47,470
though.

4230
04:35:48,410 --> 04:35:50,270
Tunnel of love this way.

4231
04:35:58,150 --> 04:35:59,870
Why don't we have a radio anymore?

4232
04:36:00,690 --> 04:36:01,310
What happened?

4233
04:36:01,570 --> 04:36:02,610
I miss our...

4234
04:36:02,610 --> 04:36:03,730
I miss our radio.

4235
04:36:03,930 --> 04:36:04,900
Wait, am I going the right way?

4236
04:36:06,750 --> 04:36:07,570
Please say yes.

4237
04:36:11,080 --> 04:36:11,400
Yes.

4238
04:36:12,860 --> 04:36:14,120
Tunnel of love.

4239
04:36:14,620 --> 04:36:16,280
Okay, get ready for smooch-in!

4240
04:36:18,960 --> 04:36:19,720
It's over.

4241
04:36:34,890 --> 04:36:37,090
Alright, so now we're going up here.

4242
04:36:37,150 --> 04:36:39,330
to Upton.

4243
04:36:43,470 --> 04:36:46,770
We're in Easton.

4244
04:36:47,650 --> 04:36:50,670
It's an Upton drive.

4245
04:36:50,890 --> 04:36:54,710
We got to deliver over there.

4246
04:36:55,530 --> 04:36:55,970
Oh.

4247
04:36:57,510 --> 04:37:01,250
It's really, really far away.

4248
04:37:02,050 --> 04:37:05,630
It's gonna take us a couple of days.

4249
04:37:07,150 --> 04:37:09,350
and up to 10 drive.

4250
04:37:12,150 --> 04:37:13,190
This way.

4251
04:37:14,690 --> 04:37:16,470
Wait, what is that tunnel to Fishing Town?

4252
04:37:17,350 --> 04:37:18,350
Where does that lead to?

4253
04:37:19,370 --> 04:37:20,390
Is there a second tunnel?

4254
04:37:22,630 --> 04:37:22,810
Hmm.

4255
04:37:23,950 --> 04:37:24,310
Whatever.

4256
04:37:24,570 --> 04:37:25,150
We're here.

4257
04:37:35,480 --> 04:37:37,200
We just grazed it.

4258
04:37:38,780 --> 04:37:39,700
Fishing Town.

4259
04:37:41,020 --> 04:37:42,720
Fishing Towns, yeah, where it just came from.

4260
04:37:42,940 --> 04:37:44,540
But that's why I was like, wait a second.

4261
04:37:45,620 --> 04:37:46,200
Shortcut!

4262
04:37:56,270 --> 04:37:59,430
Keep going, come on, shift gear.

4263
04:38:01,370 --> 04:38:07,930
One to two, two to three, three to four, four to five!

4264
04:38:08,430 --> 04:38:10,110
Maximum gears!

4265
04:38:11,570 --> 04:38:13,130
Maximum power!

4266
04:38:17,030 --> 04:38:20,910
As long as we don't lose our cargo, we're okay.

4267
04:38:21,310 --> 04:38:22,670
She's shifting it?

4268
04:38:22,770 --> 04:38:24,110
I'm shifting it!

4269
04:38:26,070 --> 04:38:27,450
They call me the anamorph.

4270
04:38:30,630 --> 04:38:31,790
Unlimited power!

4271
04:38:35,360 --> 04:38:36,560
Where am I anyway?

4272
04:38:37,840 --> 04:38:38,840
Oh wait, we're almost there.

4273
04:38:38,980 --> 04:38:40,060
This is the radio tower.

4274
04:38:44,270 --> 04:38:44,590
Right?

4275
04:38:46,260 --> 04:38:48,110
Are there multiple endings to this game?

4276
04:38:49,730 --> 04:38:50,450
Uh oh.

4277
04:38:50,930 --> 04:38:53,290
Oh, I thought we were gonna lose it.

4278
04:38:53,730 --> 04:38:55,130
I thought we were Losing it.

4279
04:38:57,270 --> 04:38:58,990
Fifth gear on a snowy uphill.

4280
04:38:59,910 --> 04:39:01,150
Don't worry about it.

4281
04:39:01,370 --> 04:39:02,870
Don't worry about it.

4282
04:39:05,230 --> 04:39:06,750
Kick it into high gear.

4283
04:39:07,410 --> 04:39:09,370
We've got snow boots on.

4284
04:39:09,690 --> 04:39:10,970
Snow tires on.

4285
04:39:12,610 --> 04:39:15,430
Okay, I think now we're in Upton, yes.

4286
04:39:16,330 --> 04:39:17,190
Very good.

4287
04:39:17,990 --> 04:39:19,830
If I keep going, yes.

4288
04:39:21,830 --> 04:39:23,050
You're not worried?

4289
04:39:23,170 --> 04:39:24,390
Good because I'm not worried.

4290
04:39:24,530 --> 04:39:26,130
If you're not worried, I'm not worried.

4291
04:39:31,950 --> 04:39:34,090
I wish we had our radio back on, though.

4292
04:39:36,590 --> 04:39:37,730
It has a story I missed.

4293
04:39:37,850 --> 04:39:39,790
It's like, yes and no.

4294
04:39:40,110 --> 04:39:42,610
It's kind of just like what the dog talked about earlier.

4295
04:39:43,490 --> 04:39:45,390
Like, the people, the villagers are kind of weird.

4296
04:39:45,670 --> 04:39:47,870
But for the most part, we've just been making deliveries.

4297
04:39:49,130 --> 04:39:50,370
Okay, I gotta be careful here.

4298
04:39:50,650 --> 04:39:52,510
I gotta be very, very careful.

4299
04:39:53,830 --> 04:39:54,230
Yes.

4300
04:39:55,770 --> 04:39:56,170

4301
04:39:59,390 --> 04:40:01,630

I got Minto for Christmas.

4329
04:42:02,110 --> 04:42:02,750

4330
04:42:03,390 --> 04:42:04,690

04:44:31,030 --> 04:44:32,630
I'll just be here.

4372
04:44:34,110 --> 04:44:35,890
This is so sad!

4373
04:44:40,980 --> 04:44:42,580

4374
04:44:47,160 --> 04:44:48,040
I have no energy.

4375
04:44:48,340 --> 04:44:50,460
No, let's just buy an energy drink to the land.

4376
04:44:58,360 --> 04:44:58,960
Energy!

4377
04:44:59,500 --> 04:44:59,640
Okay.

4378
04:45:04,160 --> 04:45:05,700
Alright, let's get another job.

4379
04:45:10,680 --> 04:45:11,780
Fishing town.

4380
04:45:12,200 --> 04:45:13,980
Oh, $71 though!

4381
04:45:15,340 --> 04:45:15,940
$81!

4382
04:45:17,140 --> 04:45:19,740
Wait, so I pick up...

4383
04:45:20,600 --> 04:45:21,660
I pick up here.

4384
04:45:21,680 --> 04:45:23,600
here and take it to Fishing Town.

4385
04:45:23,780 --> 04:45:25,660
Oh my gosh, that's basically what we just did now.

4386
04:45:26,540 --> 04:45:28,280
But $81 is huge.

4387
04:45:28,860 --> 04:45:29,780
Let's take it.

4388
04:45:32,040 --> 04:45:33,520
Pick up from Easy Auto.

4389
04:45:34,940 --> 04:45:36,780
Oh, my gas too, though.

4390
04:45:37,800 --> 04:45:40,760
I have the same experience with handhelds like the Switch
and even 3DS.

4391
04:45:41,740 --> 04:45:42,260
Right, there it goes.

4392
04:45:42,340 --> 04:45:43,900
I guess I want you to say, oh my god, that's so much worth
it.

4393
04:45:44,600 --> 04:45:48,880
Come to the conclusion that in adult life, I'm not stranded
somewhere waiting for a ride or being driven somewhere.

4394
04:45:48,940 --> 04:45:49,260
You know what?

4395
04:45:49,260 --> 04:45:50,580
That makes so much sense.

4396
04:45:52,740 --> 04:45:54,600
That does make a lot of sense.

4397
04:45:55,460 --> 04:45:56,180
Easy, Otto.

4398
04:45:56,300 --> 04:45:57,940
But where am I currently?

4399
04:46:02,960 --> 04:46:03,760
I think that...

4400
04:46:03,760 --> 04:46:04,140
Yeah.

4401
04:46:09,120 --> 04:46:10,620
It's not here, is it?

4402
04:46:10,700 --> 04:46:11,000
No.

4403
04:46:15,660 --> 04:46:16,260
Oh, wait.

4404
04:46:16,340 --> 04:46:18,780
Maybe I'm at Lopton.

4405
04:46:19,180 --> 04:46:19,620
Just kidding.

4406
04:46:19,700 --> 04:46:20,660
Okay, we gotta go to Monton.

4407
04:46:20,980 --> 04:46:22,280
I'm getting confused where I'm at.

4408
04:46:27,190 --> 04:46:31,850
My brain is not doing well with these locations.

4409
04:46:32,430 --> 04:46:33,930
At the moment.

4410
04:46:39,550 --> 04:46:40,030
Okay.

4411
04:46:42,310 --> 04:46:43,490
That makes a lot of sense.

4412
04:46:43,690 --> 04:46:45,190
Yeah, I never thought of it that way.

4413
04:46:47,110 --> 04:46:52,510
And then, but honestly, like, phones do, I feel, replace.

4414
04:46:53,890 --> 04:46:54,310
Oh, wait.

4415
04:46:56,910 --> 04:46:58,750
Replace so much, too.

4416
04:46:59,710 --> 04:47:02,410
Like, I find myself, you know, rather than...

4417
04:47:02,430 --> 04:47:04,250
Being like, oh, I'll play a game.

4418
04:47:04,490 --> 04:47:05,870
I'm doom scrolling.

4419
04:47:07,410 --> 04:47:08,450
On some app.

4420
04:47:09,590 --> 04:47:10,390
On the.

4421
04:47:11,410 --> 04:47:12,730
The children's app.

4422
04:47:14,930 --> 04:47:17,210
The app that makes my brain stupid.

4423
04:47:24,560 --> 04:47:26,380
Too busy playing B.A.

4424
04:47:26,880 --> 04:47:27,360
Exactly.

4425
04:47:28,160 --> 04:47:29,260
Gotta do my dailies.

4426
04:47:29,540 --> 04:47:30,840
That makes my brain stupid too.

4427
04:47:31,540 --> 04:47:33,560
My brain think of only anime girl.

4428
04:47:41,400 --> 04:47:42,160
While driving.

4429
04:47:42,180 --> 04:47:43,140
Absolutely.

4430
04:47:47,760 --> 04:47:49,160
Want to get a flip phone.

4431
04:47:50,940 --> 04:47:53,980
Oh, not like an actual flip phone.

4432
04:47:54,240 --> 04:47:59,980
Not like the gimmicky like the Samsung flip or anything.

4433
04:48:00,120 --> 04:48:01,360
You want to get like a straight...

4434
04:48:01,360 --> 04:48:04,560
You want to get the old person's phone.

4435
04:48:07,900 --> 04:48:10,120
The ones that have no apps on them.

4436
04:48:10,300 --> 04:48:12,160
Because old people don't know how they work.

4437
04:48:16,100 --> 04:48:17,240
Where am I?

4438
04:48:17,580 --> 04:48:18,840
I'm up here, aren't I?

4439
04:48:19,900 --> 04:48:21,200
How did I miss this?

4440
04:48:23,680 --> 04:48:25,340
Okay, if I go this...

4441
04:48:25,340 --> 04:48:27,000
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.

4442
04:48:29,100 --> 04:48:29,800
Watch this.

4443
04:48:38,620 --> 04:48:39,740
I'm breaking the map.

4444
04:48:43,770 --> 04:48:44,970
Okay, I think I'm here.

4445
04:48:46,970 --> 04:48:47,690
Get a jitterbug!

4446
04:48:47,770 --> 04:48:48,690
That's what I was thinking!

4447
04:48:50,690 --> 04:48:52,690
MGS Peace Walker was more portable.

4448
04:48:54,450 --> 04:48:55,290
Got the weapon!

4449
04:48:55,950 --> 04:48:57,210
I didn't think I'd be able to catch you live today.

4450
04:48:57,330 --> 04:48:57,790
Welcome back.

4451
04:48:57,950 --> 04:48:58,890
How's the trucking going?

4452
04:48:59,310 --> 04:49:00,550
We're trucking along!

4453
04:49:03,890 --> 04:49:05,510
Just like that.

4454
04:49:06,750 --> 04:49:08,050
Thank you for the pink!

4455
04:49:11,270 --> 04:49:12,170
There it is.

4456
04:49:14,990 --> 04:49:15,490
Right?

4457
04:49:17,830 --> 04:49:18,330
Yes.

4458
04:49:22,670 --> 04:49:25,170
Oh no, I need more energy again.

4459
04:49:27,490 --> 04:49:29,770
I remember Seb was talking about retiring.

4460
04:49:32,510 --> 04:49:35,990
But they would still come here, up here every day with MK
just to visit.

4461
04:49:38,470 --> 04:49:40,070
Made me feel special, you know?

4462
04:49:43,110 --> 04:49:44,870
Okay, we gotta go make some coffee.

4463
04:49:47,010 --> 04:49:47,230
Wait.

4464
04:49:47,990 --> 04:49:48,350
Close.

4465
04:49:48,690 --> 04:49:49,630
There we go.

4466
04:49:50,010 --> 04:49:50,510
There we go.

4467
04:49:52,930 --> 04:49:53,870
Minty Sweat.

4468
04:49:54,810 --> 04:49:55,330
Welcome back.

4469
04:49:55,710 --> 04:49:56,170
Thank you.

4470
04:49:56,990 --> 04:49:59,330
What was that about K-Truck's not being safe enough for the
U.S.?

4471
04:49:59,330 --> 04:50:01,190
They seem plenty safe to me.

4472
04:50:01,590 --> 04:50:02,210
You know what?

4473
04:50:02,290 --> 04:50:03,750
I will eat my words.

4474
04:50:04,610 --> 04:50:05,990
This thing has gone through it.

4475
04:50:07,410 --> 04:50:11,550
And it is definitely 100% realistic representation of a real
K-Truck.

4476
04:50:12,670 --> 04:50:14,470
It is not accordioned once.

4477
04:50:15,530 --> 04:50:16,430
It's blown up.

4478
04:50:17,350 --> 04:50:20,650
But what car does it blow up nowadays, am I right?

4479
04:50:22,930 --> 04:50:25,030
Oh my gosh, Gilgamesh!

4480
04:50:25,130 --> 04:50:26,370
Thank you so much for that video!

4481
04:50:26,850 --> 04:50:27,510
Thank you!

4482
04:50:27,970 --> 04:50:28,870
Thank you!

4483
04:50:30,310 --> 04:50:30,990
Uh-oh.

4484
04:50:31,450 --> 04:50:32,790
Uh-oh, we have really low energy.

4485
04:50:35,950 --> 04:50:36,730
Okay, we're fine.

4486
04:50:38,130 --> 04:50:39,170
Let her cook.

4487
04:50:47,340 --> 04:50:48,940
Every car explodes!

4488
04:50:49,300 --> 04:50:49,740
Yeah!

4489
04:50:50,520 --> 04:50:51,060
Yeah!

4490
04:50:55,420 --> 04:50:56,200
Wait, oh.

4491
04:50:57,860 --> 04:50:58,740
Where is it?

4492
04:51:00,900 --> 04:51:02,800
Wait, where'd that cup of coffee go?

4493
04:51:09,020 --> 04:51:09,500
Wait.

4494
04:51:11,040 --> 04:51:12,060
Oh, okay, there it is.

4495
04:51:12,440 --> 04:51:13,640
Oh, I was so scared for a second.

4496
04:51:15,500 --> 04:51:15,800
Okay.

4497
04:51:16,840 --> 04:51:17,300
Awesome.

4498
04:51:17,880 --> 04:51:21,100
Now we're going to Fishing Town.

4499
04:51:21,880 --> 04:51:25,640
It's really weird that the teleport back to the street
feature isn't standard across all cars.

4500
04:51:26,960 --> 04:51:31,940
You know, that is a standard feature we need and also um

4501
04:51:36,900 --> 04:51:40,860
uh also uh

4502
04:51:47,300 --> 04:51:51,780
rear view mirrors I mean cameras sorry

4503
04:51:55,040 --> 04:52:04,440
I don't know why dashcams aren't like integrated into cars
nowadays it makes me mad that I have to go buy a dash cam.

4504
04:52:06,240 --> 04:52:09,960
All cars at this point should just have dash cams built in.

4505
04:52:14,350 --> 04:52:15,410
It's so annoying.

4506
04:52:18,370 --> 04:52:19,990
So we're in Upton.

4507
04:52:20,930 --> 04:52:26,970
If I go, if I just go, if I just run off the side of the
road.

4508
04:53:06,040 --> 04:53:06,640
Uh-oh.

4509
04:53:09,460 --> 04:53:10,580
Oh, package!

4510
04:53:14,730 --> 04:53:16,070
Oh package!

4511
04:53:17,930 --> 04:53:21,650
Oh package, my package, oh where could you be?

4512
04:53:22,510 --> 04:53:26,990
Somewhere resting among the trees.

4513
04:53:27,930 --> 04:53:31,710
Oh package, my package, oh where are thee?

4514
04:53:32,730 --> 04:53:36,310
I'm looking for you, my package.

4515
04:53:37,890 --> 04:53:39,830
Um, what about my drive?

4516
04:53:41,590 --> 04:53:44,710
Wait, if I reset, come back to me.

4517
04:53:44,730 --> 04:53:45,950
Dang it.

4518
04:53:51,880 --> 04:53:55,540
Oh, package, my package, oh, where are thee?

4519
04:53:58,550 --> 04:54:06,290
Oh, package, my package, I can't believe you'd leave me
tonight.

4520
04:54:06,910 --> 04:54:07,630
Where is it?

4521
04:54:08,810 --> 04:54:09,190
Uh-oh.

4522
04:54:09,330 --> 04:54:10,670
What if it's all the way up there?

4523
04:54:13,530 --> 04:54:14,830
Check the map.

4524
04:54:21,750 --> 04:54:23,250
Can I give up on this job?

4525
04:54:25,650 --> 04:54:27,250
I can't give up on the job.

4526
04:54:30,270 --> 04:54:31,350
And low on gas?

4527
04:54:31,930 --> 04:54:32,490
I am!

4528
04:54:32,790 --> 04:54:33,450
Oh my gosh!

4529
04:54:35,230 --> 04:54:36,730
We gotta get to Easton.

4530
04:54:39,850 --> 04:54:42,650
I respect you trying to speedrun strat this game.

4531
04:54:43,490 --> 04:54:43,970
Thank you.

4532
04:54:44,710 --> 04:54:45,470
Thank you.

4533
04:54:45,570 --> 04:54:46,050
Thank you.

4534
04:54:46,490 --> 04:54:47,050
Thank you.

4535
04:54:48,210 --> 04:54:49,170
Where am I going?

4536
04:54:51,950 --> 04:54:53,250
Where am I, anyway?

4537
04:54:54,990 --> 04:54:56,110
I'm gonna give up?

4538
04:54:59,090 --> 04:55:00,410
No, my big money.

4539
04:55:01,750 --> 04:55:03,470
My big money job.

4540
04:55:11,680 --> 04:55:12,560
Oh, this one's an Eastern.

4541
04:55:12,860 --> 04:55:13,780
Okay, start job.

4542
04:55:15,160 --> 04:55:15,760
Easy auto.

4543
04:55:16,200 --> 04:55:17,060
Okay, okay, okay.

4544
04:55:18,800 --> 04:55:19,060
Uh.

4545
04:55:21,660 --> 04:55:23,100
Where am I, anyway?

4546
04:55:23,520 --> 04:55:24,600
Let's just keep going down.

4547
04:55:32,140 --> 04:55:33,280
I'll make it.

4548
04:55:37,090 --> 04:55:37,850
One more try.

4549
04:55:41,160 --> 04:55:42,740
Okay, Don't spin around.

4550
04:55:43,000 --> 04:55:43,580
Don't do that.

4551
04:55:47,120 --> 04:55:48,680
Okay, let's try it one more time.

4552
04:55:49,580 --> 04:55:52,020
A little bit, a little bit of a, you know.

4553
04:55:52,600 --> 04:55:53,520
Just finished my three days.

4554
04:55:53,620 --> 04:55:54,360
Tokyo, Disney, then.

4555
04:55:54,420 --> 04:55:55,920
See, I had a great time with my family.

4556
04:55:56,480 --> 04:55:57,080
Shit's so there.

4557
04:55:57,200 --> 04:55:58,200
Tell me everything.

4558
04:56:02,340 --> 04:56:04,120
Tell me everything.

4559
04:56:04,340 --> 04:56:05,580
Did you do Journey to the Center of the Earth?

4560
04:56:05,720 --> 04:56:06,280
Did you like it?

4561
04:56:06,340 --> 04:56:07,060
Did you love it?

4562
04:56:07,620 --> 04:56:09,120
Was it the best ride ever?

4563
04:56:09,240 --> 04:56:10,120
Was it so much fun?

4564
04:56:10,740 --> 04:56:11,620
Maybe not best ride ever.

4565
04:56:11,780 --> 04:56:13,720
But, did you have, did you like it?

4566
04:56:16,780 --> 04:56:17,920
Where am I picking up from?

4567
04:56:18,440 --> 04:56:19,200
Easy, Otto.

4568
04:56:20,100 --> 04:56:20,760
Where is that?

4569
04:56:21,520 --> 04:56:21,980
Oh, okay.

4570
04:56:26,880 --> 04:56:27,660
It was bid.

4571
04:56:27,820 --> 04:56:28,500
Shut up!

4572
04:56:31,320 --> 04:56:31,880
Humph.

4573
04:56:32,280 --> 04:56:36,620
If Easy, Cole offered mental health service benefits, I'd
tell my therapist about you.

4574
04:56:37,600 --> 04:56:39,780
You're lucky they don't offer benefits at all.

4575
04:56:49,650 --> 04:56:52,010
A part of me wants to give up on this game.

4576
04:56:52,150 --> 04:56:52,950
I'm not going to lie.

4577
04:56:55,170 --> 04:56:57,630
Part of me wants to rage quit right now.

4578
04:57:01,350 --> 04:57:03,330
A part of me really wants to rage quit.

4579
04:57:03,750 --> 04:57:05,890
Every time

4580
04:57:10,520 --> 04:57:12,820
I see you in that truck, I think it's Seb.

4581
04:57:13,760 --> 04:57:17,380
Seb told me something the last time I saw them, but I still
can't remember.

4582
04:57:18,300 --> 04:57:19,020
I missed them.

4583
04:57:19,940 --> 04:57:20,800
What is going...

4584
04:57:20,800 --> 04:57:22,380
There's like an arrow over here.

4585
04:57:23,280 --> 04:57:25,680
Maybe it's just like the chat or the,

4586
04:57:29,660 --> 04:57:29,780
you know.

4587
04:57:30,580 --> 04:57:31,820
Where am I going?

4588
04:57:37,760 --> 04:57:38,800
Snowy peaks.

4589
04:57:43,480 --> 04:57:47,580
It's like too easy to lose all the money in this game.

4590
04:57:48,060 --> 04:57:55,660
I mean, okay, I will accept fault for the last, you know,
having to give up on the last mission.

4591
04:57:56,340 --> 04:57:57,160
was my fault.

4592
04:57:57,660 --> 04:57:57,660
But!

4593
04:57:58,680 --> 04:57:59,080
But!

4594
04:58:09,600 --> 04:58:11,480
I just need, like, one!

4595
04:58:12,360 --> 04:58:15,520
I just need, I just need $100 jobs, please!

4596
04:58:16,420 --> 04:58:18,480
It's, the game is just a little too tedious.

4597
04:58:21,740 --> 04:58:22,000
Oh, wait.

4598
04:58:22,060 --> 04:58:22,820
I went the wrong way.

4599
04:58:23,000 --> 04:58:23,540
Oh my gosh.

4600
04:58:24,160 --> 04:58:24,700
This way.

4601
04:58:25,760 --> 04:58:27,660
Goro, thank you so much for the rhythm work.

4602
04:58:27,740 --> 04:58:28,360
Thank you!

4603
04:58:28,380 --> 04:58:29,600
Thank you, thank you.

4604
04:58:31,120 --> 04:58:31,640
It's fine.

4605
04:58:31,800 --> 04:58:32,220
We're chilling.

4606
04:58:33,100 --> 04:58:34,320
The shortcuts are so tempting.

4607
04:58:34,600 --> 04:58:34,880
I know.

4608
04:58:35,420 --> 04:58:36,980
Maybe they should add cargo straps.

4609
04:58:37,220 --> 04:58:37,780
I know!

4610
04:58:40,940 --> 04:58:42,680
Paperback, thank you so much for the gifted.

4611
04:58:43,080 --> 04:58:43,800
Thank you.

4612
04:58:45,560 --> 04:58:46,360
Wrong, forever.

4613
04:58:46,560 --> 04:58:48,060
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

4614
04:58:48,480 --> 04:58:48,980
Thank you.

4615
04:58:49,120 --> 04:58:49,520
Upton.

4616
04:58:51,600 --> 04:58:53,000
Okay, I'll play it straight.

4617
04:58:53,300 --> 04:58:55,180
I'll play it fair.

4618
04:58:55,800 --> 04:58:58,020
I'll play it as the game intends you to play.

4619
04:58:58,920 --> 04:58:59,600
I'll do it.

4620
04:58:59,640 --> 04:59:00,760
I'll do it properly.

4621
04:59:02,420 --> 04:59:04,260
Faithless, thank you so much for the 20 gift.

4622
04:59:04,460 --> 04:59:05,200
Thank you.

4623
04:59:06,760 --> 04:59:08,480
Is that what the duct tape is for?

4624
04:59:08,860 --> 04:59:09,480
No way.

4625
04:59:10,000 --> 04:59:10,560
Do you think?

4626
04:59:11,520 --> 04:59:12,860
Okay, thank you so much for the gift.

4627
04:59:16,020 --> 04:59:16,740
Thank you.

4628
04:59:16,920 --> 04:59:17,220
Thank you.

4629
04:59:21,050 --> 04:59:21,770
Cargo straps.

4630
04:59:21,950 --> 04:59:22,830
That'll be $500.

4631
04:59:27,270 --> 04:59:29,570
I don't want to think about how much money we just...

4632
04:59:29,850 --> 04:59:30,650
Oh my gosh.

4633
04:59:31,470 --> 04:59:32,290
Just to fill up.

4634
04:59:32,310 --> 04:59:34,450
And we didn't even fill up all the way.

4635
04:59:34,690 --> 04:59:34,970
Why?

4636
04:59:35,570 --> 04:59:37,290
Maybe the...

4637
04:59:37,290 --> 04:59:39,250
It has to be that...

4638
04:59:39,250 --> 04:59:43,050
It was like more expensive there than other gas stations.

4639
04:59:43,330 --> 04:59:44,730
It's like real life for real.

4640
04:59:47,270 --> 04:59:47,750
Terrible.

4641
04:59:49,450 --> 04:59:49,930
Terrible.

4642
04:59:51,530 --> 04:59:53,730
They're like, yeah, this place is so expensive.

4643
04:59:54,550 --> 04:59:55,830
Because it's in the city.

4644
05:00:04,980 --> 05:00:06,780
One in Smolton was way cheaper.

4645
05:00:06,880 --> 05:00:07,780
Yeah, exactly.

4646
05:00:08,900 --> 05:00:10,160
That's why I was so...

4647
05:00:10,160 --> 05:00:14,100
Maybe because you get smaller dollars.

4648
05:00:15,620 --> 05:00:18,890
Kitty, I was thinking so much before the five gets there.

4649
05:00:21,780 --> 05:00:22,200
Oh.

4650
05:00:23,880 --> 05:00:24,500
Oh.

4651
05:00:27,820 --> 05:00:28,480
La,

4652
05:00:33,180 --> 05:00:34,060
la, la.

4653
05:00:35,780 --> 05:00:36,760
Oh, no.

4654
05:00:37,060 --> 05:00:37,520
Please, no.

4655
05:00:38,200 --> 05:00:38,820
We're fine.

4656
05:00:40,320 --> 05:00:42,180
Okay, welcome to Mountain Town.

4657
05:00:44,240 --> 05:00:46,600
Phil, make us over here that they're gifted.

4658
05:00:46,920 --> 05:00:48,420
Thank you guys for all the gifted memberships.

4659
05:00:48,500 --> 05:00:49,340
I really appreciate it.

4660
05:00:49,580 --> 05:00:50,520
I missed the radio, too.

4661
05:00:50,720 --> 05:00:52,500
I think that's what's making me feel like...

4662
05:00:54,180 --> 05:00:54,980
Wait, what's...

4663
05:00:54,980 --> 05:00:55,300
One second.

4664
05:00:57,060 --> 05:00:57,880
Okay, never mind.

4665
05:00:58,860 --> 05:00:59,560
Wait, one second.

4666
05:01:03,570 --> 05:01:04,650
Okay, there we go.

4667
05:01:06,990 --> 05:01:08,690
Where are we delivering this to?

4668
05:01:09,910 --> 05:01:11,570
All the way to Lopton again.

4669
05:01:13,410 --> 05:01:15,030
Okay, okay.

4670
05:01:20,700 --> 05:01:22,480
It's depressing without the radio.

4671
05:01:22,740 --> 05:01:24,580
Does someone know how I can change it?

4672
05:01:26,340 --> 05:01:27,760
I think I asked before.

4673
05:01:27,920 --> 05:01:29,440
Maybe I missed the answer.

4674
05:01:34,990 --> 05:01:35,990
Controls in the menu.

4675
05:01:36,350 --> 05:01:36,630
Let's see.

4676
05:01:38,570 --> 05:01:39,130
Radio.

4677
05:01:39,350 --> 05:01:39,630
Oh!

4678
05:01:39,930 --> 05:01:40,830
Radio on!

4679
05:01:41,370 --> 05:01:42,330
Wait, but it is on.

4680
05:01:42,490 --> 05:01:43,330
Okay, let's...

4681
05:01:43,330 --> 05:01:44,170
What's scan?

4682
05:01:44,470 --> 05:01:45,250
Okay, up a scan.

4683
05:01:46,590 --> 05:01:46,750
Oh!

4684
05:01:51,440 --> 05:01:51,860
Oh.

4685
05:01:53,340 --> 05:01:54,160
We got the news.

4686
05:01:59,240 --> 05:02:00,020
There we go.

4687
05:02:02,060 --> 05:02:02,600
Wait, hold on.

4688
05:02:02,740 --> 05:02:03,540
I must read.

4689
05:02:04,420 --> 05:02:05,020
Journey was so fun.

4690
05:02:05,280 --> 05:02:06,140
Thunder Mountain was thrilling to me.

4691
05:02:06,260 --> 05:02:07,220
My mom really liked Beauty and the Beast.

4692
05:02:07,460 --> 05:02:09,360
I didn't expect the animatronics to look so smooth.

4693
05:02:09,660 --> 05:02:11,060
Beauty and the Beast is awesome.

4694
05:02:13,120 --> 05:02:14,420
It's so good.

4695
05:02:16,740 --> 05:02:17,160
Oh.

4696
05:02:17,720 --> 05:02:19,400
Okay, now it won't stop scanning.

4697
05:02:22,220 --> 05:02:23,200
Pick a channel.

4698
05:02:23,800 --> 05:02:24,000
Okay.

4699
05:02:24,020 --> 05:02:26,480

4700
05:02:30,170 --> 05:02:31,570
we're vibing

4701
05:02:37,680 --> 05:02:46,620
do you guys like driving maybe it's because I don't like
driving not like I don't mind this like driving games but

4702
05:02:50,100 --> 05:02:58,560
I do enjoy driving at night though that's the only time I
think I like driving like peak driving is driving at night

4703
05:02:59,320 --> 05:03:18,330
like down it's nice cool weather there's not many people out
that's like my favorite time to drive too stressful I know I

4704
05:03:18,330 --> 05:03:30,430
know some people though that like just like driving no
matter what you know what power to you could not be me I'm

4705
05:03:30,430 --> 05:03:32,050
low on energy.

4706
05:03:33,670 --> 05:03:34,190
Oh.

4707
05:03:35,770 --> 05:03:36,290
Meem-y-o!

4708
05:03:44,480 --> 05:03:45,000
Energy!

4709
05:03:45,680 --> 05:03:45,880
Get on.

4710
05:03:47,460 --> 05:03:49,100
Alright, we got 55 bucks.

4711
05:03:51,320 --> 05:03:52,160
I like riding more.

4712
05:03:52,260 --> 05:03:53,560
Oh, I like riding, too.

4713
05:03:53,700 --> 05:03:55,220
I love being a passenger princess.

4714
05:03:57,220 --> 05:03:58,240
Fishing town!

4715
05:04:00,180 --> 05:04:01,020
Big money.

4716
05:04:01,260 --> 05:04:01,440
Okay.

4717
05:04:01,840 --> 05:04:03,260
Guys, we won't mess this one up.

4718
05:04:04,920 --> 05:04:07,160
I pick up all the way over there.

4719
05:04:14,360 --> 05:04:16,920
I love being a passenger princess.

4720
05:04:24,830 --> 05:04:26,350
No cargo loss.

4721
05:04:26,570 --> 05:04:26,970
Woohoo!

4722
05:04:29,690 --> 05:04:30,330
A shortcut.

4723
05:04:35,190 --> 05:04:37,110
I could shortcut through here.

4724
05:04:39,210 --> 05:04:39,730
Come on.

4725
05:04:40,050 --> 05:04:41,010
Knock down the trees.

4726
05:04:41,750 --> 05:04:42,450
There we go.

4727
05:04:46,000 --> 05:04:47,920
Can't wait for the next skip tech I'm gonna learn.

4728
05:04:50,040 --> 05:04:51,780
I'm just a tutorial channel.

4729
05:04:59,500 --> 05:05:01,600
This would have been so tedious without those upgrades.

4730
05:05:02,080 --> 05:05:04,040
I think the upgrades though, they force you.

4731
05:05:04,860 --> 05:05:07,120
Kind of can't continue the game without them.

4732
05:05:07,780 --> 05:05:08,900
Minto already is our princess.

4733
05:05:09,120 --> 05:05:10,820
I'm not a princess, I'm the maid.

4734
05:05:12,680 --> 05:05:14,240
I can't be the princess.

4735
05:05:14,620 --> 05:05:16,160
I'm serving the princess.

4736
05:05:26,730 --> 05:05:29,870
Kindred, welcome to... membership, thank you!

4737
05:05:30,090 --> 05:05:31,350
Okay, we're here.

4738
05:05:34,350 --> 05:05:35,970
Definitely serving.

4739
05:05:36,370 --> 05:05:37,830
I'm serving and I'm slaying.

4740
05:05:38,730 --> 05:05:39,730
And I'm possessing.

4741
05:05:40,330 --> 05:05:40,950
And I'm crying.

4742
05:05:42,430 --> 05:05:43,610
Just ghost things.

4743
05:05:46,030 --> 05:05:49,410
You think I can shortcut here?

4744
05:05:51,230 --> 05:05:51,490
Oh.

4745
05:05:54,350 --> 05:05:56,610
Tip number 55.

4746
05:05:57,270 --> 05:05:58,670
An easy delivery code?

4747
05:05:59,190 --> 05:06:00,230
You cannot.

4748
05:06:01,410 --> 05:06:03,430
Shortcut at that corner.

4749
05:06:03,530 --> 05:06:07,010
Are you saying I'm a princess?

4750
05:06:07,870 --> 05:06:09,090
Yes, you're my princess.

4751
05:06:23,080 --> 05:06:23,560
Shortcut!

4752
05:06:30,780 --> 05:06:32,600
I mean, though I'm not a princess.

4753
05:06:35,100 --> 05:06:35,740
Yeah, wait.

4754
05:06:36,440 --> 05:06:38,040
Isn't the flower shop here?

4755
05:06:46,330 --> 05:06:48,470
My dad bought me a gamer subs cup for Christmas.

4756
05:06:48,630 --> 05:06:49,330
I literally screamed.

4757
05:06:51,290 --> 05:06:52,210
It says, thank you!

4758
05:06:52,330 --> 05:06:53,290
Oh, there it is.

4759
05:06:59,090 --> 05:07:04,210
Multi-hour drives along mostly empty roads with nothing but
farm fields and an occasional house on them is a meditative

4760
05:07:04,210 --> 05:07:05,250
experience.

4761
05:07:05,450 --> 05:07:05,730
I love it.

4762
05:07:06,090 --> 05:07:06,410
Yes!

4763
05:07:06,590 --> 05:07:07,350
I get it though!

4764
05:07:07,450 --> 05:07:16,070
I know some people are like, oh my gosh, I hate driving like
one long, like straight road with nothing around, but I'm

4765
05:07:16,070 --> 05:07:18,130
like, that's what I crave.

4766
05:07:18,430 --> 05:07:19,150
I crave!

4767
05:07:20,250 --> 05:07:21,170
Oh my god!

4768
05:07:22,850 --> 05:07:24,110
Good greetings.

4769
05:07:24,570 --> 05:07:25,970
I have feelings.

4770
05:07:26,830 --> 05:07:27,890
Several of them.

4771
05:07:28,290 --> 05:07:30,510
This is new to me.

4772
05:07:30,950 --> 05:07:33,030
I feel happy about this.

4773
05:07:33,810 --> 05:07:35,730
Do you have feelings?

4774
05:07:36,690 --> 05:07:38,550
I will be your feelings.

4775
05:07:39,770 --> 05:07:40,430
What?

4776
05:07:40,690 --> 05:07:42,390
What do you mean you'll be my feelings?

4777
05:07:42,550 --> 05:07:43,390
I think I have feelings.

4778
05:07:44,850 --> 05:07:46,470
Like I'm feeling annoyed.

4779
05:07:56,170 --> 05:07:57,050
All right.

4780
05:08:03,420 --> 05:08:03,740
Good one.

4781
05:08:04,300 --> 05:08:04,300
Thanks.

4782
05:08:06,120 --> 05:08:07,420
Finally, you guys like my jokes.

4783
05:08:08,420 --> 05:08:08,820
Finally.

4784
05:08:10,500 --> 05:08:12,420
I will be your feelings is really cute, though.

4785
05:08:13,260 --> 05:08:14,160
Yeah, I like them.

4786
05:08:14,460 --> 05:08:14,680
Pencil!

4787
05:08:14,900 --> 05:08:16,600
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the office.

4788
05:08:18,900 --> 05:08:21,700
Can you be mega boss, Princess Queen?

4789
05:08:22,460 --> 05:08:23,020
And say, yeah.

4790
05:08:28,540 --> 05:08:29,180
Thank

4791
05:08:36,410 --> 05:08:38,070
you so much for that, Kaisupa.

4792
05:08:38,490 --> 05:08:38,890
Thank you!

4793
05:08:39,810 --> 05:08:41,250
Funny request.

4794
05:08:42,770 --> 05:08:42,970
Woo!

4795
05:08:43,930 --> 05:08:44,290
Woo!

4796
05:08:44,870 --> 05:08:45,790
Okay, we're fine.

4797
05:08:47,510 --> 05:08:48,110
Everything's good.

4798
05:08:48,350 --> 05:08:49,410
All right, fishing town.

4799
05:08:50,990 --> 05:08:52,090
The proper way.

4800
05:08:54,050 --> 05:08:55,410
Not the proper way.

4801
05:08:56,070 --> 05:08:57,010
Not the proper way.

4802
05:08:57,150 --> 05:08:57,790
Not the proper way.

4803
05:08:58,650 --> 05:08:59,730
Merry Christmas, Mito!

4804
05:08:59,990 --> 05:09:01,230
I like driving by hate traffic.

4805
05:09:01,410 --> 05:09:01,730
Yeah.

4806
05:09:01,730 --> 05:09:03,890
I don't think anybody likes traffic, though.

4807
05:09:04,350 --> 05:09:04,690
Except, okay.

4808
05:09:06,050 --> 05:09:07,810
Sometimes I would get stuck in traffic.

4809
05:09:09,870 --> 05:09:14,730
And if I was listening to a podcast I really liked, I would
be okay with it.

4810
05:09:14,970 --> 05:09:15,550
You know what I mean?

4811
05:09:16,410 --> 05:09:20,030
I would be like, oh yeah, I want to finish this episode of
my podcast.

4812
05:09:21,110 --> 05:09:26,330
So I would be like, it's fine that there's traffic.

4813
05:09:33,840 --> 05:09:34,320
Creepcast.

4814
05:09:35,040 --> 05:09:35,700
What's that?

4815
05:09:46,110 --> 05:09:55,110
stores same with oh yes with audio books too yes yes yes
hard time is when I get to do most of my singing I will do

4816
05:09:55,110 --> 05:10:08,200
that too I like practice songs oh sorry in the car no I
wonder if I'm almost done with this game I think maybe just

4817
05:10:08,200 --> 05:10:15,920
a few more quests because it seems like if I like go to the
quest and the goals It seems like there's just three more

4818
05:10:15,920 --> 05:10:16,360
maybe.

4819
05:10:18,120 --> 05:10:21,040
Put your karaoke streams on for my four hour plus drives!

4820
05:10:22,120 --> 05:10:23,800
That's so embarrassing.

4821
05:10:26,560 --> 05:10:27,620
That's so embarrassing.

4822
05:10:27,820 --> 05:10:29,320
Why do you guys watch me?

4823
05:10:31,180 --> 05:10:33,160
Why do you guys listen to me?

4824
05:10:33,520 --> 05:10:33,940
What's it?

4825
05:10:34,220 --> 05:10:34,560
Why?

4826
05:10:39,060 --> 05:10:41,140
Sometimes listen to your VODs.

4827
05:10:41,380 --> 05:10:42,060

4828
05:10:45,180 --> 05:10:51,860

05:10:51,860 --> 05:10:54,720
commuting and yeah, I'm commuting with your commute.

4830
05:11:01,280 --> 05:11:02,920
Minto goes on the speakers.

4831
05:11:04,100 --> 05:11:04,520
Scary.

4832
05:11:05,740 --> 05:11:08,380
That's some real haunting right there.

4833
05:11:10,240 --> 05:11:11,520
Please watching a Minto stream.

4834
05:11:12,000 --> 05:11:12,640
We're flying Japan.

4835
05:11:14,280 --> 05:11:15,360
I'm so sorry!

4836
05:11:16,540 --> 05:11:18,140
2026 will be your year.

4837
05:11:19,060 --> 05:11:20,320
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year!

4838
05:11:20,460 --> 05:11:22,440
Please don't send a Zuber chat if you can.

4839
05:11:23,180 --> 05:11:25,320
If you lost your job, don't do that.

4840
05:11:26,020 --> 05:11:28,580
Save your money, especially also, you're going to Japan.

4841
05:11:28,920 --> 05:11:30,280
Wait, can we shortcut here?

4842
05:11:32,260 --> 05:11:34,180
Okay, shortcut, but like, legitimate.

4843
05:11:37,700 --> 05:11:39,000
Uh-oh, not legitimate.

4844
05:11:43,660 --> 05:11:44,140
Oh!

4845
05:11:48,120 --> 05:11:48,280
Oh!

4846
05:11:50,400 --> 05:11:52,560
Pinto funny and good storyteller.

4847
05:11:52,760 --> 05:11:53,420
You think so?

4848
05:11:54,320 --> 05:11:55,900
You aren't seeing the parts of Minky.

4849
05:11:56,420 --> 05:11:57,400
What do you mean?

4850
05:12:01,040 --> 05:12:02,200
Holy cow.

4851
05:12:03,640 --> 05:12:04,620
Guys, we did that.

4852
05:12:05,760 --> 05:12:07,160
Where am I anyway?

4853
05:12:09,020 --> 05:12:09,960
To Eastern.

4854
05:12:10,580 --> 05:12:10,940
Okay.

4855
05:12:13,020 --> 05:12:15,380
I want to see where that other...

4856
05:12:22,280 --> 05:12:23,260
Where the other...

4857
05:12:24,560 --> 05:12:25,360
tunnel window.

4858
05:12:26,340 --> 05:12:26,720
You know?

4859
05:12:27,840 --> 05:12:28,640
Is this the one?

4860
05:12:29,740 --> 05:12:31,820
Oh, I think it's just a side road.

4861
05:12:32,060 --> 05:12:33,840
Okay, I think they both lead to the same tunnel.

4862
05:12:35,140 --> 05:12:35,760
I think.

4863
05:12:39,100 --> 05:12:39,860
Oh my gosh.

4864
05:12:40,200 --> 05:12:40,740
Oh my gosh.

4865
05:12:40,920 --> 05:12:41,360
Oh my gosh.

4866
05:12:42,600 --> 05:12:43,780
I'm too good at my job.

4867
05:12:44,640 --> 05:12:45,040
Maybe.

4868
05:12:46,000 --> 05:12:46,700
Oh my god.

4869
05:12:50,920 --> 05:12:52,440
No, we're on half a tank of fuel.

4870
05:12:52,560 --> 05:12:53,060
We're all good.

4871
05:12:54,840 --> 05:12:56,160
Alright, where are we going to?

4872
05:12:56,500 --> 05:12:58,260
All the way up to the corner.

4873
05:13:00,480 --> 05:13:01,140
Holy cow.

4874
05:13:02,300 --> 05:13:04,440
Yeah, we need coffee though, that's for sure.

4875
05:13:08,140 --> 05:13:09,260
What other stations we got?

4876
05:13:10,440 --> 05:13:11,120
The news.

4877
05:13:11,640 --> 05:13:11,860
Oh, wait.

4878
05:13:14,180 --> 05:13:15,240
We'll go with this one.

4879
05:13:16,740 --> 05:13:17,700
99.9.

4880
05:13:18,760 --> 05:13:19,720
That's my station.

4881
05:13:20,320 --> 05:13:21,180
Snow drifting.

4882
05:13:28,550 --> 05:13:29,850
You're scaring me, Minto.

4883
05:13:30,590 --> 05:13:31,210
I'm a ghost.

4884
05:13:31,350 --> 05:13:32,550
That's like partially what I do.

4885
05:13:33,170 --> 05:13:33,550
Okay.

4886
05:13:35,750 --> 05:13:37,190
That's, like, part of my job.

4887
05:13:37,710 --> 05:13:38,330
I'm not gonna lie.

4888
05:13:42,950 --> 05:13:44,070
I can't help it.

4889
05:13:44,970 --> 05:13:48,130
Skim-setting with all the snowflakes makes me think of
Moomit's episode!

4890
05:13:48,510 --> 05:13:50,530
We're Little Vibe's Lady of the Cold!

4891
05:13:51,270 --> 05:13:52,010
Oh, my gosh.

4892
05:13:52,130 --> 05:13:54,650
I love Moomit so much.

4893
05:13:55,150 --> 05:13:55,570
Stop.

4894
05:13:55,770 --> 05:13:56,430
You're gonna make me...

4895
05:13:56,430 --> 05:14:00,550
There's a 24-hour stream of, like, Moomit episodes that I
just, like...

4896
05:14:00,550 --> 05:14:02,390
Sometimes I'll put it on for hours.

4897
05:14:03,190 --> 05:14:04,550
I love Moomit.

4898
05:14:06,910 --> 05:14:08,410
Literally in the drop description.

4899
05:14:11,130 --> 05:14:12,910
Let's just say that all ghosts are spooky.

4900
05:14:13,130 --> 05:14:14,710
I think all ghosts are spooky, though.

4901
05:14:15,830 --> 05:14:19,290
Are you saying that I'm not spooky and that I'm doing a
terrible job and that I should...

4902
05:14:19,950 --> 05:14:21,610
I should just... I should just quit?

4903
05:14:22,370 --> 05:14:25,050
Are you... Are you saying that I should just quit while I'm
ahead?

4904
05:14:26,130 --> 05:14:30,830
Are you saying I'm not spooky at all and that I'll never
amount to anything in my afterlife?

4905
05:14:35,680 --> 05:14:37,000
That I can't scare you!

4906
05:14:43,590 --> 05:14:44,490
Well, it's fine.

4907
05:14:45,050 --> 05:14:49,890
I'm not like, you know, Monsters Inc., how they live off the
energy of laughter or whatever.

4908
05:14:50,270 --> 05:14:51,470
I just live off the energy.

4909
05:14:53,090 --> 05:14:54,270
I just, you know.

4910
05:14:55,790 --> 05:14:58,630
It doesn't need to be...

4911
05:14:58,630 --> 05:15:02,250
I just live off your life for it, so you don't need to be...

4912
05:15:02,250 --> 05:15:03,770
You don't even need to believe in me.

4913
05:15:06,910 --> 05:15:07,590
You know?

4914
05:15:08,550 --> 05:15:09,770
I've already got the...

4915
05:15:09,770 --> 05:15:11,290
I've got the upper hand here.

4916
05:15:14,850 --> 05:15:23,310
vampire i need to finish what we do in the shadows did
anybody watch that first of all did you watch that show or

4917
05:15:23,310 --> 05:15:35,250
did you only see the movie and if one or the other if you
saw the show did you like the ending tell me if the ending

4918
05:15:35,250 --> 05:15:44,930
was good or not i've seen clips i love that show never heard
of it actually it's like the office meets vampires like

4919
05:15:44,930 --> 05:15:45,870
that's literally it.

4920
05:15:50,330 --> 05:15:51,770
Oh, shoot, my energy.

4921
05:15:52,090 --> 05:15:54,390
Wait, I think I'll die here.

4922
05:16:11,000 --> 05:16:11,800
Okay, get in.

4923
05:16:12,180 --> 05:16:13,400
We're gonna get in real quick.

4924
05:16:18,840 --> 05:16:19,500
Ending was good?

4925
05:16:20,620 --> 05:16:23,140
I admittedly ran out of steam in the last couple seasons.

4926
05:16:23,640 --> 05:16:24,700
I have a few really good seasons.

4927
05:16:24,820 --> 05:16:31,520
Yeah, that's the thing, as I also, like, kind of just, like,
I don't know.

4928
05:16:31,640 --> 05:16:38,780
I think I, it was kind of like, this happens to me way too
often, where I'll be like super into a series and then it'll

4929
05:16:38,780 --> 05:16:47,020
take a long time in between seasons and I just run it's not
that I run out of interest but like you know maybe I'm busy

4930
05:16:47,020 --> 05:16:55,240
maybe something you know you've actually jump scared me a
couple of times so feel proud of that I don't know if I

4931
05:16:55,240 --> 05:17:02,580
should feel proud of that or not yeah you find other things
or you're just It's like working on other stuff, you know.

4932
05:17:03,980 --> 05:17:05,000
Alright, 2.99.

4933
05:17:05,160 --> 05:17:06,900
We're nearly halfway there.

4934
05:17:07,640 --> 05:17:10,720
Oh, we're almost halfway there.

4935
05:17:11,440 --> 05:17:14,560
Oh, Snowy Peaks, $87.

4936
05:17:16,880 --> 05:17:18,600
We're picking up in Clifton.

4937
05:17:18,820 --> 05:17:24,600
That's fine, because we have to basically go back down there
to get out of here anyway.

4938
05:17:27,240 --> 05:17:28,940
Lemon on a pair.

4939
05:17:33,620 --> 05:17:41,560
terrible at watching stuff or finishing stuff just because
my interest drops it's really like with whistle word with

4940
05:17:41,560 --> 05:17:55,220
series that like I said they take forever to do another
season like that's when I'll fall off like my truck here

4941
05:17:55,220 --> 05:18:02,560
nice save watching you cries scares you I don't cry so much
Why?

4942
05:18:03,260 --> 05:18:04,800
Maybe I am a bit of a cry, baby.

4943
05:18:07,460 --> 05:18:09,220
Maybe I cry a lot.

4944
05:18:09,780 --> 05:18:10,160
Maybe.

4945
05:18:10,640 --> 05:18:12,560
But that's also, like, just ghost things, you know?

4946
05:18:13,600 --> 05:18:17,800
I wouldn't be a ghost if I wasn't filled with such regret
and despair and pain.

4947
05:18:18,880 --> 05:18:21,660
That's why I say, being a ghost, so overriding.

4948
05:18:26,640 --> 05:18:28,660
A little bit is a charm point.

4949
05:18:31,500 --> 05:18:32,760
Stupid cry, baby.

4950
05:18:32,960 --> 05:18:34,020
Stupid cry, baby.

4951
05:18:38,320 --> 05:18:40,220
I did cry recently.

4952
05:18:40,440 --> 05:18:43,720
I cried about dinosaur ride ending.

4953
05:18:45,720 --> 05:18:48,180
I cried about dinosaur ride.

4954
05:18:50,740 --> 05:18:53,880
You guys think I should get gas here in Smolton?

4955
05:19:01,320 --> 05:19:03,500
You almost cried about movement just now.

4956
05:19:03,800 --> 05:19:05,100
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

4957
05:19:08,820 --> 05:19:21,620
You cried this about dinosaurs shut up shut up the birds
they run away when i approach them they know i'm on to them

4958
05:19:21,620 --> 05:19:26,520
i don't think they're real oh no it's one of these

4959
05:19:31,740 --> 05:19:41,280
yeah i don't think i will last if i don't get gas here in
smelton we'll do that we'll do that

4960
05:19:44,870 --> 05:19:47,090
And there they go.

4961
05:19:51,100 --> 05:19:51,480
Oh, wait.

4962
05:19:53,380 --> 05:19:53,760
Beep.

4963
05:19:54,240 --> 05:19:54,600
Weep.

4964
05:19:54,860 --> 05:19:56,700
I love my sappy cry by Beyoshi.

4965
05:20:00,420 --> 05:20:01,440
Nobody should be surprised.

4966
05:20:01,600 --> 05:20:02,940
What is a dinosaur if not a lizard?

4967
05:20:03,100 --> 05:20:03,440
Oh, my gosh.

4968
05:20:03,500 --> 05:20:05,120
That was the best part about Florida.

4969
05:20:05,600 --> 05:20:06,200
There, you guys.

4970
05:20:06,240 --> 05:20:07,740
There were so many lizards.

4971
05:20:08,220 --> 05:20:10,420
In Florida, they would just be running around.

4972
05:20:11,840 --> 05:20:13,120
Looking extra cute tonight.

4973
05:20:13,560 --> 05:20:14,020
Still.

4974
05:20:14,620 --> 05:20:15,560
I have work in the morning.

4975
05:20:16,340 --> 05:20:16,800
5 a.m.

4976
05:20:16,820 --> 05:20:17,960
I'm sure Sneaks up fast.

4977
05:20:20,160 --> 05:20:20,800
Good night!

4978
05:20:22,860 --> 05:20:24,020
Am I going the right way?

4979
05:20:24,880 --> 05:20:25,200
Yes.

4980
05:20:25,600 --> 05:20:26,340
To Smalton.

4981
05:20:27,020 --> 05:20:27,660
To Dampton.

4982
05:20:27,860 --> 05:20:28,920
Okay, Smalton time.

4983
05:20:31,600 --> 05:20:33,060
Half of them are invasive, though.

4984
05:20:33,140 --> 05:20:34,040
Don't, wait, seriously?

4985
05:20:35,600 --> 05:20:39,080
What are the... What are the lizards, though?

4986
05:20:39,320 --> 05:20:40,340
What, like, what are they called?

4987
05:20:41,700 --> 05:20:42,620
What kind of lizards are they?

4988
05:20:42,680 --> 05:20:45,040
I cried for the first time in years after watching you play
The Walking Dead.

4989
05:20:45,180 --> 05:20:47,120
Oh my gosh, that made me cry too though.

4990
05:20:47,880 --> 05:20:50,020
Dinosaurs are more birds than lizards though.

4991
05:20:50,480 --> 05:20:51,760
I like birds too though.

4992
05:20:52,340 --> 05:20:52,720
I like...

4993
05:20:56,420 --> 05:20:56,880
Anolis.

4994
05:20:58,000 --> 05:20:58,360
Lots...

4995
05:20:58,360 --> 05:20:59,240
I like when they...

4996
05:20:59,240 --> 05:20:59,440
Okay.

4997
05:21:00,000 --> 05:21:01,820
I'm gonna demonstrate what they do.

4998
05:21:03,080 --> 05:21:07,540
When you see the lizard and they're standing there and then
they start going like this.

4999
05:21:14,570 --> 05:21:15,790
I like when they do that.

5000
05:21:17,710 --> 05:21:19,890
Or when the red thing comes out of their neck.

5001
05:21:29,090 --> 05:21:31,170
all right let's go get our gas

5002
05:21:35,260 --> 05:21:41,480
we'll have to take on more jobs but oh what's another couple
back and forth huh

5003
05:21:50,990 --> 05:21:57,510
i can't really think of what i want for christmas so i got
mostly money this year oh a quarter went into blue archive

5004
05:21:58,590 --> 05:22:01,550
what'd you get did you get anything good Merry Christmas,
Min.

5005
05:22:01,630 --> 05:22:02,490
Merry Christmas!

5006
05:22:03,130 --> 05:22:04,550
No, I know, thank you.

5007
05:22:05,310 --> 05:22:06,090
Gamble safely.

5008
05:22:09,490 --> 05:22:11,890
The head bob is them intimidating you.

5009
05:22:12,090 --> 05:22:13,290
I know, but it's so funny.

5010
05:22:14,030 --> 05:22:15,310
It's not intimidating at all.

5011
05:22:15,490 --> 05:22:16,210
It's just so cute.

5012
05:22:17,670 --> 05:22:18,330
Oh, wait.

5013
05:22:19,550 --> 05:22:20,750
I'm heading to pizza.

5014
05:22:21,390 --> 05:22:23,330
I saw lizards at Hallmat and thought of you.

5015
05:22:24,690 --> 05:22:30,210
I've gotten several people sending me, like, pictures of
lizards and things and being, like...

5016
05:22:30,430 --> 05:22:30,830
of you.

5017
05:22:32,110 --> 05:22:33,350
It's like the best thing ever.

5018
05:22:35,030 --> 05:22:38,970
I love it so much when people like tag me and things being
like, thinking of you.

5019
05:22:39,830 --> 05:22:41,050
Or send me things.

5020
05:22:43,130 --> 05:22:44,570
It's the best ever.

5021
05:22:47,230 --> 05:22:49,490
Weirder dragons sometimes wave their hands.

5022
05:22:52,130 --> 05:22:53,890
But they're too cute.

5023
05:22:55,070 --> 05:22:56,210
They're way too cute.

5024
05:23:00,430 --> 05:23:01,490
more coffee, do I?

5025
05:23:03,150 --> 05:23:04,430
I do not.

5026
05:23:05,930 --> 05:23:06,490
Yikes.

5027
05:23:07,310 --> 05:23:09,950
You know, Bucko, you're starting to grow on me.

5028
05:23:10,350 --> 05:23:10,770
No way!

5029
05:23:10,850 --> 05:23:11,570
Character development?

5030
05:23:12,670 --> 05:23:13,730
Here's 2850.

5031
05:23:14,270 --> 05:23:15,170
Just kidding.

5032
05:23:15,430 --> 05:23:16,090
It's the opposite.

5033
05:23:16,270 --> 05:23:17,230
Oh, it's opposite thing.

5034
05:23:17,890 --> 05:23:18,450
Pay up.

5035
05:23:18,770 --> 05:23:19,630
Now go away.

5036
05:23:20,790 --> 05:23:21,630
2850, though.

5037
05:23:22,070 --> 05:23:22,750
That's way better.

5038
05:23:32,820 --> 05:23:34,260
I'm gonna grab another one even.

5039
05:23:41,380 --> 05:23:42,000
Uh-oh.

5040
05:23:42,380 --> 05:23:42,780
Oh shoot.

5041
05:23:43,260 --> 05:23:43,500
Oh shoot.

5042
05:23:43,700 --> 05:23:45,440
I didn't realize how bad I was going in cold.

5043
05:23:45,960 --> 05:23:46,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5044
05:23:46,920 --> 05:23:47,130
Get in.

5045
05:23:48,640 --> 05:23:49,380
Okay, we're fine.

5046
05:23:50,560 --> 05:23:51,580
Why is he so grumpy?

5047
05:23:51,940 --> 05:23:52,980
I think I would be too.

5048
05:23:56,660 --> 05:23:58,160
Working in this weather.

5049
05:23:58,760 --> 05:23:59,120
Yeesh.

5050
05:24:02,540 --> 05:24:05,180
28.50 way better than the highway robbery in Upton.

5051
05:24:05,660 --> 05:24:06,880
That's why it's called Upton.

5052
05:24:07,460 --> 05:24:09,340
Because the prices are up a ton.

5053
05:24:12,640 --> 05:24:13,500
You get it?

5054
05:24:15,420 --> 05:24:16,580
They're up, Todd.

5055
05:24:19,600 --> 05:24:21,440
I don't know how to recycle the cans.

5056
05:24:21,680 --> 05:24:22,840
I wish I could figure it out.

5057
05:24:28,320 --> 05:24:29,440
Are you proud of that one?

5058
05:24:31,460 --> 05:24:32,580
You don't think it was good?

5059
05:24:37,500 --> 05:24:38,580
You don't think so?

5060
05:24:40,040 --> 05:24:42,160
Why did I actually like that pun?

5061
05:24:47,370 --> 05:24:48,750
I went to your home at the other weekend.

5062
05:24:48,850 --> 05:24:49,290
It was wonderful.

5063
05:24:49,490 --> 05:24:50,830
I had to ask if you put...

5064
05:24:50,830 --> 05:24:53,710
I had to ask you to put you on a small retuber and you I
gave a great recommendation.

5065
05:24:54,370 --> 05:24:56,310
I'm glad you like her.

5066
05:24:57,370 --> 05:24:58,910
Chocolate pie eater, welcome back.

5067
05:24:59,310 --> 05:25:01,230
Thank you for coming to see me.

5068
05:25:02,410 --> 05:25:03,450
Thank you.

5069
05:25:09,720 --> 05:25:11,060
Yeah, I'm smiling.

5070
05:25:13,360 --> 05:25:14,600
All right, where are we going to?

5071
05:25:16,700 --> 05:25:17,960
Snowy peaks again.

5072
05:25:18,180 --> 05:25:19,340
Probably the very...

5073
05:25:19,340 --> 05:25:22,120
Why can't anything, like, be a close spot?

5074
05:25:23,700 --> 05:25:26,100
Axel Valentine, welcome to Mambuja.

5075
05:25:26,160 --> 05:25:27,240
Thank you!

5076
05:25:27,780 --> 05:25:28,640
Thank you, thank you.

5077
05:25:31,680 --> 05:25:33,420
I'm determined to beat this game today.

5078
05:25:39,760 --> 05:25:41,620
You're banned from making puns ever again.

5079
05:25:42,900 --> 05:25:44,340
You guys hate me.

5080
05:25:44,540 --> 05:25:45,540
You hate me.

5081
05:25:50,360 --> 05:25:52,180
I am filled with determination.

5082
05:25:53,260 --> 05:25:54,360
I'm also just happy to stream.

5083
05:25:56,180 --> 05:25:57,820
Sorry that I had no schedule this week.

5084
05:25:59,820 --> 05:26:03,100
But of course next week we will return to our regular game.

5085
05:26:03,120 --> 05:26:04,560
schedule the programming?

5086
05:26:08,380 --> 05:26:08,780
Whoa.

5087
05:26:09,340 --> 05:26:10,140
Wait, hold on.

5088
05:26:10,380 --> 05:26:11,060
Oh, sorry.

5089
05:26:11,280 --> 05:26:11,620
Oh my gosh.

5090
05:26:12,100 --> 05:26:14,980
The interface sometimes gives me, like, a whiplash.

5091
05:26:16,540 --> 05:26:19,960
I like to give them ant farms, butterfly cages, and pregnant
as egg sacks for Christmas.

5092
05:26:20,100 --> 05:26:23,100
By the time the children has gifts, it's too late for the
parent to refuse.

5093
05:26:23,800 --> 05:26:25,160
Wait, but that's so awesome.

5094
05:26:25,780 --> 05:26:27,900
You're giving them the gift of responsibility.

5095
05:26:33,760 --> 05:26:54,000
An ant farm I want an ant farm even now is it are they tough
to manage oh I was fixing my eye I

5096
05:27:00,170 --> 05:27:06,890
remember raising butterflies when I was a kid wait oh gosh
okay I couldn't see anything everything's fine don't mind

5097
05:27:06,890 --> 05:27:11,730
the broken pot I'm still an excellent delivery driver.

5098
05:27:13,290 --> 05:27:14,590
One of the best in the biz.

5099
05:27:19,130 --> 05:27:20,610
Just remember to give him some food.

5100
05:27:21,230 --> 05:27:21,970
With the ants?

5101
05:27:23,710 --> 05:27:25,750
I'll give him a sugar cube.

5102
05:27:30,150 --> 05:27:32,570
Oh, my ants would be eating good.

5103
05:27:32,890 --> 05:27:35,910
I'm going to give my ants A5 Wagyu.

5104
05:27:38,610 --> 05:27:38,890
Wait.

5105
05:27:40,450 --> 05:27:41,610
You have a PL box.

5106
05:27:42,430 --> 05:27:43,030
I will.

5107
05:27:43,050 --> 05:27:43,750
soon.

5108
05:27:46,190 --> 05:27:46,890
Ten-tsutsu!

5109
05:27:47,490 --> 05:27:49,730
Staff-san are setting it up for us.

5110
05:27:52,410 --> 05:27:56,930
But I don't know if you can- I don't know if you should send
ads in the mail.

5111
05:27:58,790 --> 05:28:01,310
I don't know if that one will make it through, Chief right?

5112
05:28:06,550 --> 05:28:08,910
I think that one might give me tone.

5113
05:28:09,770 --> 05:28:11,090
But I appreciate it.

5114
05:28:14,710 --> 05:28:23,090
I can imagine the message now just being like Hey Mint We
received something in the mail for you I'm not sure how you

5115
05:28:23,090 --> 05:28:27,230
feel about it It's just an envelope of ants

5116
05:28:34,410 --> 05:28:44,250
Like they're crawling out and everything Just put them in
the envelope with like a the apple pit.

5117
05:28:46,690 --> 05:28:47,470
Oops, all ants.

5118
05:28:49,310 --> 05:28:52,790
Yeah, maybe don't send ants to the PO box.

5119
05:28:54,790 --> 05:28:55,930
Rain of ants.

5120
05:28:59,050 --> 05:29:00,950
You can buy a starter colony.

5121
05:29:01,230 --> 05:29:08,530
One thing I really want to learn to get good at, well, this
isn't with ants, but with bees, I want to learn how to

5122
05:29:08,530 --> 05:29:09,970
identify the queen.

5123
05:29:10,770 --> 05:29:21,610
I like to watch those videos of, like, people um rescuing
bees in like places like you know just kind of like trying

5124
05:29:21,610 --> 05:29:32,050
to move the nest to a to a nicer to a better place and
things like that and so easily they'll be like okay i have

5125
05:29:32,050 --> 05:29:38,330
to find the queen and like they'll they'll find it usually
so easily i'm like how do you know

5126
05:29:43,060 --> 05:29:44,700
Bekeeper Minto Ark.

5127
05:29:48,540 --> 05:29:52,740
If I had time and place for beekeeping, I would.

5128
05:29:53,860 --> 05:29:56,040
You can send all kinds of things in unmarked boxes.

5129
05:29:56,980 --> 05:29:58,940
Don't send ladybugs, I would cry.

5130
05:30:00,220 --> 05:30:00,760
Of terror.

5131
05:30:01,860 --> 05:30:02,620
Sorry, berry bugs.

5132
05:30:03,540 --> 05:30:05,500
Monitor lizards by mail, too.

5133
05:30:06,460 --> 05:30:06,940
How?

5134
05:30:07,800 --> 05:30:09,320
How do you get a lizard in the mail?

5135
05:30:09,400 --> 05:30:10,060
What do you put them to say?

5136
05:30:10,080 --> 05:30:10,620
sleep?

5137
05:30:11,420 --> 05:30:17,660
I think you'd give him a little bit of a snacky snack to
make him close his eyes for a couple extra hours and

5138
05:30:22,580 --> 05:30:23,740
ladybug scare me.

5139
05:30:32,850 --> 05:30:34,370
Turmite queen looks crazy.

5140
05:30:34,810 --> 05:30:34,850
Really?

5141
05:30:35,050 --> 05:30:35,470
Why?

5142
05:30:36,070 --> 05:30:36,990
They like beefy?

5143
05:30:39,230 --> 05:30:41,170
Reptiles can actually be shipped responsibly.

5144
05:30:41,330 --> 05:30:42,230
It just costs a lot.

5145
05:30:44,310 --> 05:30:44,890
I see.

5146
05:30:45,470 --> 05:30:46,750
Alright, where are we headed to?

5147
05:30:48,010 --> 05:30:48,230
Oh!

5148
05:30:48,870 --> 05:30:51,070
Muntin, all the way in the corner.

5149
05:30:53,130 --> 05:30:55,850
Don't mind the stuff falling.

5150
05:30:57,570 --> 05:30:59,330
It will all be delivered safely.

5151
05:31:02,610 --> 05:31:03,450
Oh, gosh.

5152
05:31:03,750 --> 05:31:05,550
This last bit is kind of torturous.

5153
05:31:05,950 --> 05:31:07,670
Maybe I should have saved my money better.

5154
05:31:09,930 --> 05:31:11,530
I should have done more missions.

5155
05:31:12,710 --> 05:31:13,990
Me identifying queen.

5156
05:31:15,870 --> 05:31:17,530
I can't be the queen.

5157
05:31:18,870 --> 05:31:21,370
I can't be queen and meruos.

5158
05:31:22,490 --> 05:31:23,290
Ants are off the table.

5159
05:31:23,470 --> 05:31:24,870
What about sea monkeys?

5160
05:31:25,950 --> 05:31:28,190
Those, I just need to rehydrate, right?

5161
05:31:29,010 --> 05:31:31,590
I just put those guys in water and they grow.

5162
05:31:32,770 --> 05:31:35,250
I'm gonna have a zoo in my maid cafe.

5163
05:31:36,850 --> 05:31:41,070
You guys are gonna send me all sorts of creatures and
critters.

5164
05:31:52,360 --> 05:31:57,060
I've heard of issues where people will get things for
their...

5165
05:31:58,200 --> 05:32:11,340
like fish tanks and oh my gosh and it'll be like dried rocks
or something you know and they don't realize that there's

5166
05:32:11,340 --> 05:32:23,240
that there's worms in there like a dehydrated worm or
something and it'll revive and and I've seen things where

5167
05:32:23,240 --> 05:32:31,080
like they'll be like hey my fish started going missing
what's happening and they'll be like check for the worm

5168
05:32:31,080 --> 05:32:40,820
there might be a worm hidden amongst the sand that is eating
your fish or something like that isn't that so crazy you

5169
05:32:40,820 --> 05:32:48,800
have common what what mullin growing in my backyard ladybugs
love it no

5170
05:32:52,000 --> 05:32:58,180
aquarium worms terrify me yeah the bobbin worms yes yes yes
that's a That's exactly it.

5171
05:33:01,100 --> 05:33:03,880
Nothing more classic than a water ball for fish.

5172
05:33:04,240 --> 05:33:05,040
Water ball, what's that?

5173
05:33:05,580 --> 05:33:07,060
I wanna send you prints of the photos, I think.

5174
05:33:07,800 --> 05:33:11,340
See more, I was going through them, the ones that you gave
me at home at.

5175
05:33:12,480 --> 05:33:14,040
I love them so much.

5176
05:33:14,260 --> 05:33:15,160
Thank you.

5177
05:33:17,000 --> 05:33:20,920
You're, you're, you're, you're, your, your photos are so
great.

5178
05:33:23,640 --> 05:33:31,420
I wanna start like making a, like a, I guess I really do
need to buy a photo album for kind of, I want to like

5179
05:33:31,420 --> 05:33:39,800
remember events and stuff that I've done with the pictures
that people, like I have a bunch of, sometimes people will

5180
05:33:39,800 --> 05:33:41,720
send me checkies and stuff.

5181
05:33:43,280 --> 05:33:48,320
And so I have a bunch of checkies of, from events that are
in my checkie albums.

5182
05:33:49,940 --> 05:33:50,580
Oh wait.

5183
05:33:51,500 --> 05:33:54,300
Open, grab, and place.

5184
05:33:54,920 --> 05:33:55,950
And get in.

5185
05:33:57,340 --> 05:33:58,780
Hi, have an easy day!

5186
05:34:00,320 --> 05:34:01,360
Okie dokie!

5187
05:34:05,160 --> 05:34:08,560
I'm going to buy more coffee.

5188
05:34:12,960 --> 05:34:14,080
That's easy March.

5189
05:34:15,240 --> 05:34:16,860
We're almost there.

5190
05:34:17,640 --> 05:34:20,000
We're sure getting there somehow.

5191
05:34:21,440 --> 05:34:21,940
Hey mate.

5192
05:34:24,260 --> 05:34:26,780
I'm gonna start by a camera to start making checkies.

5193
05:34:27,380 --> 05:34:32,740
Or you could always get like a portable printer, checky
printer, if you don't want to buy the whole camera.

5194
05:34:34,060 --> 05:34:37,240
If you have time on Friday night, I host a book club at
Sixos.

5195
05:34:38,320 --> 05:34:40,140
I'm the only one who knows it's a book club.

5196
05:34:40,800 --> 05:34:43,400
But it's wonderful to just spend time with my new friends.

5197
05:34:43,900 --> 05:34:44,500
That's so cute.

5198
05:34:45,420 --> 05:34:46,440
That will cost $7.

5199
05:34:47,500 --> 05:34:47,880
Cheers.

5200
05:34:48,780 --> 05:34:49,580
Thank you.

5201
05:34:51,520 --> 05:34:51,960
And...

5202
05:34:51,960 --> 05:34:53,320
What does the duct tape do?

5203
05:34:53,440 --> 05:34:54,240
And the bird seed.

5204
05:34:54,340 --> 05:34:56,240
Wait, the bird seed for the birds.

5205
05:34:57,460 --> 05:34:59,560
Do you think I should make a fire?

5206
05:35:00,740 --> 05:35:01,740
Wait, I mean...

5207
05:35:03,540 --> 05:35:04,100
Actually...

5208
05:35:04,100 --> 05:35:05,720
I'm by...

5209
05:35:10,740 --> 05:35:12,340
I'm by the cabin.

5210
05:35:12,460 --> 05:35:14,420
We'll just go make some coffee in there.

5211
05:35:16,820 --> 05:35:22,700
What was the point of me buying this dang coffee pot if I'm
not buying the firewood to use it?

5212
05:35:26,720 --> 05:35:27,640
I'm what?

5213
05:35:27,960 --> 05:35:29,240
What did I say that?

5214
05:35:36,770 --> 05:35:38,170
Okay, let's get another job.

5215
05:35:42,610 --> 05:35:44,590
Mountain town, mountain town.

5216
05:35:45,050 --> 05:35:45,990
Fishing town.

5217
05:35:46,170 --> 05:35:48,590
We feed caterpillars, plants they don't normally live on.

5218
05:35:48,910 --> 05:35:50,690
The butterflies that become horribly mutated.

5219
05:35:51,330 --> 05:35:51,490
Ew!

5220
05:35:52,250 --> 05:35:53,310
Oh gosh, that's creepy.

5221
05:35:53,590 --> 05:35:55,510
$55, but mountain town.

5222
05:35:56,030 --> 05:35:56,730
Let's take that.

5223
05:36:00,780 --> 05:36:02,380
We gotta go to Winton, though.

5224
05:36:04,160 --> 05:36:04,540
Okay.

5225
05:36:06,240 --> 05:36:06,800
Okay.

5226
05:36:06,820 --> 05:36:07,900
Pick up from bar.

5227
05:36:08,160 --> 05:36:10,900
Alright, let's go get it.

5228
05:36:13,320 --> 05:36:14,800
It's just like bam.

5229
05:36:22,880 --> 05:36:25,340
If I'm going down, I'm taking these trees with me.

5230
05:36:25,620 --> 05:36:27,000
Oh, I went down.

5231
05:36:29,680 --> 05:36:32,220
Do you lose money when you...

5232
05:36:32,920 --> 05:36:34,900
Do you lose money when you...

5233
05:36:34,900 --> 05:36:35,700
When that happens?

5234
05:36:47,250 --> 05:36:47,770
No?

5235
05:36:48,010 --> 05:36:48,490
Okay, good.

5236
05:36:53,170 --> 05:36:54,210
See, everything's fine.

5237
05:36:55,990 --> 05:36:57,590
Free unlimited kit trucks.

5238
05:36:58,430 --> 05:36:58,810
Yubi!

5239
05:37:01,790 --> 05:37:03,210
I don't quite know where we...

5240
05:37:03,210 --> 05:37:03,950
Oh, I think I know.

5241
05:37:08,420 --> 05:37:09,500
Uh, we're gonna explode.

5242
05:37:09,900 --> 05:37:10,420
No, we're not.

5243
05:37:11,200 --> 05:37:11,660
No, we're not.

5244
05:37:12,160 --> 05:37:12,720
No, we're winning.

5245
05:37:13,140 --> 05:37:13,640
We're winning.

5246
05:37:14,120 --> 05:37:14,520
We're winning.

5247
05:37:15,140 --> 05:37:15,480
We're winning.

5248
05:37:19,020 --> 05:37:20,040
Wait, where am I?

5249
05:37:20,160 --> 05:37:20,360
Oh.

5250
05:37:23,420 --> 05:37:24,220
Alright, here we go.

5251
05:37:25,660 --> 05:37:26,180
Wait.

5252
05:37:32,200 --> 05:37:33,520
Five big booms!

5253
05:37:34,220 --> 05:37:35,620
Boom, boom, boom!

5254
05:37:36,720 --> 05:37:37,040
Boom!

5255
05:37:41,280 --> 05:37:43,080
Speed running is always the answer.

5256
05:37:50,620 --> 05:37:52,500
Let's make the coffee here.

5257
05:37:54,380 --> 05:37:55,140
At the cabin.

5258
05:38:02,650 --> 05:38:04,850
I feel like trucks weren't really meant to roll like that.

5259
05:38:05,190 --> 05:38:06,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

5260
05:38:07,210 --> 05:38:09,250
That's like literally the tech for the KT.

5261
05:38:09,270 --> 05:38:16,470
trucks if k trucks come to america now you know how to oops

5262
05:38:29,240 --> 05:38:30,900

K is for crazy.

5267
05:39:09,650 --> 05:39:10,610
Crazy driving.

5268
05:39:11,090 --> 05:39:11,390
Alright.

5269
05:39:12,150 --> 05:39:13,090
We're going to Winton.

5270
05:39:16,890 --> 05:39:17,630
Wait, where's the pickup?

5271
05:39:18,450 --> 05:39:21,550
Oh, I thought the pickup was at Winton.

5272
05:39:21,790 --> 05:39:22,890
I'm so stupid!

5273
05:39:24,810 --> 05:39:26,490
Guys, I made a grave mistake.

5274
05:39:34,340 --> 05:39:35,940
Happy to spend another birthday watching my car.

5275
05:39:35,940 --> 05:39:36,740
I'm using Jacob!

5276
05:39:36,860 --> 05:39:37,660
Happy birthday!

5277
05:39:38,560 --> 05:39:40,540
Thank you so much for today's comfy stream.

5278
05:39:40,660 --> 05:39:41,920
It is pretty comfy, isn't it?

5279
05:39:42,460 --> 05:39:43,760
We're just driving around.

5280
05:39:44,740 --> 05:39:46,500
I'm doing flips and tricks.

5281
05:39:47,280 --> 05:39:49,360
You guys are watching my sick moves.

5282
05:39:58,480 --> 05:39:59,780
Oh, there we go.

5283
05:40:03,480 --> 05:40:06,500
Thank you saying, Winton is the best thing I've heard.

5284
05:40:06,920 --> 05:40:07,400
Why?

5285
05:40:08,640 --> 05:40:09,120
Winton.

5286
05:40:11,000 --> 05:40:11,480
Winton.

5287
05:40:13,780 --> 05:40:14,740
All right, over the...

5288
05:40:14,740 --> 05:40:14,920
Okay.

5289
05:40:18,410 --> 05:40:19,070
Oops.

5290
05:40:19,530 --> 05:40:21,550
I kind of...

5291
05:40:22,190 --> 05:40:24,570
Very sick moves, terminal even.

5292
05:40:25,870 --> 05:40:27,510
No, we're alive.

5293
05:40:27,790 --> 05:40:28,910
We're alive and well.

5294
05:40:30,770 --> 05:40:31,590
Everything's good.

5295
05:40:31,790 --> 05:40:32,490
Everything's chill.

5296
05:40:32,710 --> 05:40:33,550
Everything's cool.

5297
05:40:34,390 --> 05:40:35,410
We're in the bar, right?

5298
05:40:35,570 --> 05:40:36,150
I think so.

5299
05:40:40,060 --> 05:40:41,420
Oh, oops.

5300
05:40:45,220 --> 05:40:45,880
Yo!

5301
05:40:46,340 --> 05:40:48,920
I have a huge business idea for you.

5302
05:40:49,460 --> 05:40:51,900
Picture a vending machine that sold other things.

5303
05:40:51,920 --> 05:40:52,840
They're vending machines.

5304
05:40:53,280 --> 05:40:54,300
Great, eh?

5305
05:40:57,300 --> 05:40:58,400
Thank you.

5306
05:41:03,070 --> 05:41:03,230
Oh.

5307
05:41:03,930 --> 05:41:05,710
I almost messed that up already.

5308
05:41:09,210 --> 05:41:12,930
I almost already messed up.

5309
05:41:14,190 --> 05:41:15,370
Now where are we going?

5310
05:41:18,090 --> 05:41:19,890
Oh, the delivery!

5311
05:41:21,950 --> 05:41:23,110
Is in Mountain Town.

5312
05:41:23,370 --> 05:41:24,030
Not in Winton.

5313
05:41:28,600 --> 05:41:30,380
It's not Winton, everybody.

5314
05:41:30,540 --> 05:41:31,640
It's Mountain Town.

5315
05:41:35,020 --> 05:41:35,300
Tuna?

5316
05:41:35,920 --> 05:41:36,710
What did I just say?

5317
05:41:39,700 --> 05:41:40,280
Tuna?

5318
05:41:40,800 --> 05:41:42,000
What did I just say?

5319
05:41:42,240 --> 05:41:42,920
No Winton.

5320
05:41:49,180 --> 05:41:53,400
The only way is if vending machines sell vending machines to
other vending machines.

5321
05:41:55,440 --> 05:41:55,580
Yes.

5322
05:41:58,600 --> 05:41:59,180
Shame.

5323
05:41:59,500 --> 05:42:00,560
Shame.

5324
05:42:03,620 --> 05:42:03,740
Minton.

5325
05:42:05,600 --> 05:42:07,180
Oh my gosh.

5326
05:42:07,680 --> 05:42:09,160
Minton MM.

5327
05:42:09,480 --> 05:42:10,140
Flip it around.

5328
05:42:11,160 --> 05:42:11,820
Winton win.

5329
05:42:15,240 --> 05:42:17,720
The birds are fake.

5330
05:42:18,480 --> 05:42:20,220
The snow is fake.

5331
05:42:20,840 --> 05:42:22,620
The beer is fake.

5332
05:42:22,960 --> 05:42:24,600
And the car is fake.

5333
05:42:25,240 --> 05:42:28,880
But you know what's not fake about this?

5334
05:42:29,500 --> 05:42:31,520
My awesome skills.

5335
05:42:32,860 --> 05:42:35,160
I'm driving on the road.

5336
05:42:36,000 --> 05:42:38,100
The road is fake.

5337
05:42:39,260 --> 05:42:44,760
This sign is fake and the trees are fake.

5338
05:42:45,540 --> 05:42:48,690
But you know what's not fake about this?

5339
05:42:50,880 --> 05:42:53,160
My love for you.

5340
05:42:54,380 --> 05:42:55,700
Wait, the beer is fake?

5341
05:42:55,940 --> 05:42:56,720
I'm so sorry.

5342
05:43:00,420 --> 05:43:02,800
I imagine you would drive like this IRL.

5343
05:43:03,800 --> 05:43:04,080
Maybe.

5344
05:43:05,460 --> 05:43:06,220
Put me in.

5345
05:43:06,380 --> 05:43:07,680
Put me behind a wheel, coach.

5346
05:43:11,400 --> 05:43:11,920
Alright.

5347
05:43:12,240 --> 05:43:13,560
Where are we headed to?

5348
05:43:16,760 --> 05:43:17,320
Eastend.

5349
05:43:17,880 --> 05:43:19,740
Right by our fuel delivery.

5350
05:43:22,800 --> 05:43:23,760
Guys, we...

5351
05:43:23,760 --> 05:43:26,600
After this, we'll be so close to...

5352
05:43:26,600 --> 05:43:28,920
We could just take on an easy job.

5353
05:43:29,500 --> 05:43:32,810
An electric light bulb and a video game is still an electric
light bulb.

5354
05:43:35,620 --> 05:43:36,240
Nah.

5355
05:43:41,130 --> 05:43:42,890
Why are there only birds?

5356
05:43:44,770 --> 05:43:45,510
I don't mind.

5357
05:43:45,670 --> 05:43:49,690
I love birds, but I need a drink.

5358
05:43:52,950 --> 05:43:53,350
Yeah.

5359
05:43:59,790 --> 05:44:00,650
Doki bird.

5360
05:44:06,580 --> 05:44:08,140
Logically little tubby crows.

5361
05:44:08,760 --> 05:44:10,740
Are you calling doki tubby?

5362
05:44:11,280 --> 05:44:16,940
Uh-oh, doki bird.

5363
05:44:17,160 --> 05:44:18,120
You need to go on a diet.

5364
05:44:18,800 --> 05:44:19,740
Diet bird.

5365
05:44:22,560 --> 05:44:24,200
I thought chubby was in though.

5366
05:44:25,140 --> 05:44:25,320
No?

5367
05:44:32,810 --> 05:44:33,550
Mito, cute!

5368
05:44:33,790 --> 05:44:34,490
Mito, sweet!

5369
05:44:34,930 --> 05:44:35,610
Thank you!

5370
05:44:37,830 --> 05:44:38,910
We love chubby.

5371
05:44:39,390 --> 05:44:40,570
Yeah, I thought chubby was in.

5372
05:44:46,750 --> 05:44:51,150
It's not, it's not, it's, I mean, it's chub, but it's, it's
literally for the winter.

5373
05:44:51,930 --> 05:44:53,090
They must have it.

5374
05:44:53,470 --> 05:44:54,850
Catherine, welcome to membership.

5375
05:44:55,170 --> 05:44:55,690
Thank you!

5376
05:44:57,670 --> 05:45:00,130
Don't, do you ever wish that like humans...

5377
05:45:01,990 --> 05:45:02,490
hibernated?

5378
05:45:03,410 --> 05:45:04,290
Hi Minto, I love you!

5379
05:45:04,890 --> 05:45:04,990
Fro!

5380
05:45:07,870 --> 05:45:12,050
Um, Fro, why didn't you send me Christmas raccoon pictures?

5381
05:45:16,500 --> 05:45:17,360
What the heck?

5382
05:45:20,420 --> 05:45:30,780
sometimes actually don't i wish sometimes like i could eat a
lot of food and get really fat and then sleep and lose it

5383
05:45:30,780 --> 05:45:31,840
all in the winter

5384
05:45:37,750 --> 05:45:52,890

sure my body tries to every winter it's a pain to fight it

5385
05:45:52,890 --> 05:46:05,170

said don't you ever wish you could just hibernate I'm

5386
05:46:07,400 --> 05:46:16,780
hibernating for the winter it's literally the dream I'm
having right now you don't follow me queen I can't DM you I

5387
05:46:16,780 --> 05:46:30,040
do have the power to change that I'll try and remember later
you'd socially miss out on a lot oh gosh can you imagine

5388
05:46:30,040 --> 05:46:42,000
waking up and being like what did i miss but like oh my gosh
it would be so weird because like you know half of the i

5389
05:46:42,000 --> 05:46:47,460
love you more than tunas he's like what is happening the
girls are fighting

5390
05:46:51,160 --> 05:47:01,240
how like the southern hemisphere right now it's summer so so
they would be awake and they would make a bunch of memes and

5391
05:47:01,240 --> 05:47:10,580
a bunch of crazy stuff and then you'd wake up like several
months later and you'd be like what happened what

5392
05:47:15,880 --> 05:47:22,980
if you want to like go to a place what if you want to go to

5393
05:47:28,820 --> 05:47:37,700
okay all right we're almost there guys 2.99 we just need
like a 50 job 50.

5394
05:47:40,700 --> 05:47:49,480
what the not enough energy oh wow that's crazy i can i can
make coffee

5395
05:47:52,780 --> 05:47:58,060
genetics and whatnot would make hibernating very diverse for
people I want to be a moon man.

5396
05:47:58,340 --> 05:47:59,200
I want to sleep.

5397
05:48:01,340 --> 05:48:02,380
Okay, snowy peaks.

5398
05:48:05,060 --> 05:48:06,340
Weston to snowy peaks.

5399
05:48:06,580 --> 05:48:06,960
Let's do it.

5400
05:48:08,700 --> 05:48:09,660
Pick up from bar.

5401
05:48:18,120 --> 05:48:20,600
Then we can buy whatever the hell they wanted me to get.

5402
05:48:23,260 --> 05:48:25,440
And hopefully nothing more ever.

5403
05:48:27,660 --> 05:48:30,300
My family lives in a town called Weston.

5404
05:48:30,980 --> 05:48:32,160
Yeah, I'm going there right now.

5405
05:48:32,600 --> 05:48:33,940
I'm going to go...

5406
05:48:33,940 --> 05:48:34,860
I'm going to go...

5407
05:48:34,860 --> 05:48:35,940
Oh, dang it.

5408
05:48:36,040 --> 05:48:36,680
I lost it.

5409
05:48:37,340 --> 05:48:38,760
I was gonna go say...

5410
05:48:38,760 --> 05:48:42,400
I was gonna say I'm going to pick her mom up, but...

5411
05:48:42,400 --> 05:48:43,540
I lost it.

5412
05:48:43,920 --> 05:48:44,320
Sorry.

5413
05:48:48,320 --> 05:48:48,720
My...

5414
05:48:50,460 --> 05:48:51,620
Is this the right bar?

5415
05:48:56,260 --> 05:48:57,320
I don't think so.

5416
05:48:58,220 --> 05:48:59,140
I'll try it anyway.

5417
05:49:06,920 --> 05:49:10,160
Sixo keeps trying to pitch everyone their business ideas at
our meetups.

5418
05:49:11,060 --> 05:49:15,780
I tried helping to be nice at first, but it's actually just
plain fun to help out my twin.

5419
05:49:16,720 --> 05:49:17,840
Okay, wrong one.

5420
05:49:20,680 --> 05:49:21,640
You were this close.

5421
05:49:22,840 --> 05:49:24,340
I know, I just...

5422
05:49:29,680 --> 05:49:31,140
I'm a flop.

5423
05:49:33,740 --> 05:49:35,300
I'm a hack, I'm a fraud.

5424
05:49:40,640 --> 05:49:42,260
Failed the quick time event.

5425
05:49:44,500 --> 05:49:45,900
Where is the bar up here?

5426
05:49:47,440 --> 05:49:47,700
Oops.

5427
05:49:48,040 --> 05:49:48,680
How did I do that?

5428
05:49:52,980 --> 05:49:53,860
The bar!

5429
05:49:55,260 --> 05:49:55,660
The bar!

5430
05:49:56,720 --> 05:49:57,160
Oh,

5431
05:50:00,190 --> 05:50:01,930
this is the factory that we need to get to.

5432
05:50:02,990 --> 05:50:04,250
This raises an interesting question.

5433
05:50:04,370 --> 05:50:06,990
Is it the weather that causes hibernation or more hardwired?

5434
05:50:07,350 --> 05:50:07,930
Also, the U.S.

5435
05:50:08,010 --> 05:50:09,790
National Park Service hosts a FAP...

5436
05:50:09,790 --> 05:50:11,150
I do know about FAP, but...

5437
05:50:11,170 --> 05:50:14,810

05:50:54,770 --> 05:50:55,370
He's cooking!

5444
05:50:56,850 --> 05:50:57,890
Mr. Walter!

5445
05:50:58,650 --> 05:50:59,730
Alright, Snowy Peaks.

5446
05:51:02,650 --> 05:51:07,350
Well, what if you get a spam that you... is not actually a
spam?

5447
05:51:11,740 --> 05:51:13,040
That's pretty bad.

5448
05:51:14,440 --> 05:51:16,680
32 fat bear chunk one.

5449
05:51:19,420 --> 05:51:23,060
After end of delivery number two, the world was split into
two.

5450
05:51:23,660 --> 05:51:24,760
East and Weston.

5451
05:51:25,380 --> 05:51:28,220
This marked the beginning of the era known as the Cold
Weather Delivery.

5452
05:51:31,220 --> 05:51:33,200
After the end of delivery, too.

5453
05:51:33,860 --> 05:51:35,000
We'll split the two.

5454
05:51:37,420 --> 05:51:38,540
Oh, so iconic.

5455
05:51:41,240 --> 05:51:42,580
You love Spam.

5456
05:51:43,020 --> 05:51:45,460
I want some Spam Musubi right now.

5457
05:51:46,280 --> 05:51:47,200
I could go for that.

5458
05:51:49,920 --> 05:51:51,560
Mmm, Spam Musubi.

5459
05:51:52,600 --> 05:51:53,080
Mmm.

5460
05:52:03,230 --> 05:52:04,790
Spam was to be loved!

5461
05:52:05,030 --> 05:52:07,050
Yeah, it's so good!

5462
05:52:08,270 --> 05:52:13,830
Oh, I feel like part of me always wants to like make more
spam dishes, but also I'm like...

5463
05:52:13,830 --> 05:52:14,350
The salt.

5464
05:52:16,090 --> 05:52:18,650
My ectoplasm would dry the heck out.

5465
05:52:23,660 --> 05:52:25,980
Spam grilled cheese!

5466
05:52:28,740 --> 05:52:29,800
That's so yummy.

5467
05:52:34,680 --> 05:52:37,520
Locomoco Spam I don't think I've ever had Locomoco before

5468
05:52:45,370 --> 05:52:48,090
Like I know what it is But I've never had it

5469
05:52:52,990 --> 05:53:00,390
Typer bed Thanks so much for staying Good night I don't
think we have much of the game left I'm just vibing honestly

5470
05:53:02,090 --> 05:53:09,590

hours Ha ha ha Six hours!

5471
05:53:10,070 --> 05:53:10,070
Almost!

5472
05:53:11,150 --> 05:53:12,290
Mmm, we're vibing.

5473
05:53:17,950 --> 05:53:20,990
It's been a while since I've done like a longer stream,
so...

5474
05:53:20,990 --> 05:53:25,250
A couple of the games though that I have that I want to
complete for my...

5475
05:53:26,750 --> 05:53:27,190
Um...

5476
05:53:28,090 --> 05:53:29,950
For my 50 games of the year?

5477
05:53:30,310 --> 05:53:33,210
Or a bit longer, so there will be a couple longer streams.

5478
05:53:34,250 --> 05:53:34,990
Coming up.

5479
05:53:36,840 --> 05:53:37,980
Alright, let's see where are we going.

5480
05:53:39,440 --> 05:53:39,880
Mountain!

5481
05:53:42,840 --> 05:53:45,800
I like this music too, so I'm like super vibing.

5482
05:53:50,560 --> 05:53:52,040
What does the game count at?

5483
05:53:52,220 --> 05:53:54,540
I think I have five more games I need to do.

5484
05:53:55,820 --> 05:53:56,580
Merry Mentimers.

5485
05:53:56,700 --> 05:53:57,420
Thank you, John.

5486
05:53:57,600 --> 05:53:58,400
Thank you.

05:54:02,160 --> 05:54:03,020

5489
05:54:03,640 --> 05:54:04,020
Yes.

5490
05:54:04,380 --> 05:54:05,860
Actually, I need to get some more soon.

5491
05:54:07,820 --> 05:54:08,760
Isn't spam salty?

5492
05:54:09,480 --> 05:54:09,780
Yeah.

5493
05:54:10,240 --> 05:54:11,760
That's why I said it's kind of salty.

5494
05:54:12,880 --> 05:54:21,020

5496
05:54:28,940 --> 05:54:32,080

5497
05:54:36,220 --> 05:54:38,200

5498
05:54:48,160 --> 05:54:49,440
God, I love rice.

5499
05:54:49,620 --> 05:54:53,280
You were so right and so real.

5500
05:54:56,820 --> 05:54:57,280
Oh, there was...

5501
05:54:57,280 --> 05:54:57,960
I was thinking...

5502
05:54:57,960 --> 05:54:59,220
What was I thinking of today?

5503
05:55:00,760 --> 05:55:02,720
I was thinking of something.

5504
05:55:04,880 --> 05:55:06,740
And how, like, just, you know...

5505
05:55:11,360 --> 05:55:11,840
Uh...

5506
05:55:12,660 --> 05:55:18,160
How rice is just not, like, a super staple...

5507
05:55:18,200 --> 05:55:19,740
like American dish.

5508
05:55:26,380 --> 05:55:28,280
Spam with Oh wait, hold on.

5509
05:55:28,520 --> 05:55:29,760
I have to look at the road.

5510
05:55:31,020 --> 05:55:31,200
Spam.

5511
05:55:31,360 --> 05:55:32,740
Rice with spam and mayo.

5512
05:55:33,080 --> 05:55:33,400
I haven't.

5513
05:55:36,180 --> 05:55:36,800
Yeah, we eat.

5514
05:55:36,940 --> 05:55:38,120
America loves bread.

5515
05:55:41,340 --> 05:55:42,440
America loves bread.

5516
05:55:46,720 --> 05:55:47,560
Grab it.

5517
05:55:48,560 --> 05:55:52,080
And I'm gonna place it!

5518
05:55:54,000 --> 05:55:54,480
Uh-oh.

5519
05:55:54,840 --> 05:55:55,220
Get in?

5520
05:55:57,540 --> 05:55:58,800
We made it!

5521
05:55:59,140 --> 05:56:00,140
Oh my gosh!

5522
05:56:00,460 --> 05:56:05,080
Now I can go buy this chains from the auto shop.

5523
05:56:05,740 --> 05:56:06,900
Where do I get them though?

5524
05:56:07,780 --> 05:56:08,940
Any auto shop?

5525
05:56:11,980 --> 05:56:15,400
I feel like a lot of Hispanic and Asian dishes require it.

5526
05:56:15,520 --> 05:56:15,780
Yeah!

5527
05:56:17,240 --> 05:56:20,240
Rice is just so good, it's so versatile, it's perfect.

5528
05:56:29,090 --> 05:56:29,610
Nice.

5529
05:56:29,850 --> 05:56:30,470
Well done, Minto.

5530
05:56:30,650 --> 05:56:31,170
Thank you.

5531
05:56:31,670 --> 05:56:32,590
Thank you.

5532
05:56:40,300 --> 05:56:42,100
I'm not quite sure where I go.

5533
05:56:42,900 --> 05:56:43,800
Any auto shop?

5534
05:56:44,360 --> 05:56:45,380
Let's try.

5535
05:56:48,440 --> 05:56:49,920
Okay, trucks are so good.

5536
05:56:50,920 --> 05:56:52,580
They just roll back on their side.

5537
05:56:56,520 --> 05:56:58,020
Wait, I'm going back upstairs.

5538
05:56:58,300 --> 05:56:58,660
Just kidding.

5539
05:56:59,180 --> 05:56:59,700
Down?

5540
05:57:00,460 --> 05:57:01,680
Wait, I think I'm gonna explode.

5541
05:57:03,280 --> 05:57:04,000
Never punished.

5542
05:57:04,420 --> 05:57:05,060
Never punished.

5543
05:57:08,390 --> 05:57:10,310
My family eats so many potatoes.

5544
05:57:11,910 --> 05:57:13,330
Okay, but I love potatoes.

5545
05:57:16,230 --> 05:57:16,770
Oops.

5546
05:57:17,150 --> 05:57:17,970
I ran over.

5547
05:57:23,540 --> 05:57:25,680
I think it's only...

5548
05:57:29,270 --> 05:57:31,730
I think it's only the...

5549
05:57:31,730 --> 05:57:33,610
I think it's the one at the...

5550
05:57:38,340 --> 05:57:39,420
At the...

5551
05:57:40,360 --> 05:57:41,440
Fishing area.

5552
05:57:42,360 --> 05:57:43,160
In fact...

5553
05:57:43,160 --> 05:57:43,460
Wait, hold on.

5554
05:57:43,480 --> 05:57:43,680
on.

5555
05:57:43,940 --> 05:57:44,660
What if we get a job?

5556
05:57:45,080 --> 05:57:50,100
I don't know if I need more money, but what if we get a job
that is like too fishing town, you know?

5557
05:57:53,780 --> 05:57:56,580
Oh, not enough energy.

5558
05:57:56,880 --> 05:57:57,420
Okay, hold on.

5559
05:58:03,430 --> 05:58:04,790
I think my chat froze.

5560
05:58:05,710 --> 05:58:07,050
Wait, one second.

5561
05:58:10,210 --> 05:58:11,210
My chat froze.

5562
05:58:12,470 --> 05:58:16,200
I see you guys.

5563
05:58:18,380 --> 05:58:19,800
It's cold in here.

5564
05:58:19,920 --> 05:58:20,820
I'll freeze.

5565
05:58:20,840 --> 05:58:39,980

5567
05:58:52,360 --> 05:58:58,140
444K subscribers this year.

5568
05:58:59,500 --> 05:58:59,960
I feel...

5569
05:58:59,960 --> 05:59:00,240
Oh, wait.

5570
05:59:00,280 --> 05:59:01,120
I was going to get that job.

5571
05:59:02,440 --> 05:59:03,100
I was like, dang.

5572
05:59:05,380 --> 05:59:05,940
Dang it.

5573
05:59:06,200 --> 05:59:07,160
Not that I really care.

5574
05:59:07,560 --> 05:59:08,800
But, you know, it's like...

5575
05:59:08,800 --> 05:59:10,780
When you have a goal and you're like, Oh, yeah.

5576
05:59:11,120 --> 05:59:12,320
I want to complete the goal.

5577
05:59:14,040 --> 05:59:14,380
Oh, wait.

5578
05:59:14,420 --> 05:59:15,060
This is good.

5579
05:59:15,140 --> 05:59:15,660
This is perfect.

5580
05:59:16,040 --> 05:59:17,580
It's a pickup right where I need it.

5581
05:59:18,080 --> 05:59:18,400
Yes.

5582
05:59:25,360 --> 05:59:25,680
Yes.

5583
05:59:26,340 --> 05:59:27,640
Be a triumph for next year.

5584
05:59:28,620 --> 05:59:31,520
I guess it gives me more time to plan something really much
better, though.

5585
05:59:34,040 --> 05:59:34,920
For it.

5586
05:59:43,790 --> 05:59:46,170
You got really close relatively.

5587
05:59:46,390 --> 05:59:46,930
That's true.

5588
05:59:47,070 --> 05:59:48,130
I was thinking that also.

5589
05:59:48,830 --> 05:59:50,390
Like, I feel like I'm so close.

5590
05:59:50,870 --> 05:59:53,030
But, you know, well, the number is close.

5591
05:59:53,450 --> 05:59:56,810
Obviously, thousands is not very close, but, you know.

5592
05:59:58,350 --> 05:59:59,090
Say no more.

5593
05:59:59,170 --> 06:00:01,050
I'm getting 20k bots to sub to your channel.

5594
06:00:03,170 --> 06:00:06,950
Those twins are always talking about each other, but have
you ever seen them together?

5595
06:00:07,850 --> 06:00:08,810
I haven't.

5596
06:00:09,630 --> 06:00:11,830
I think there's three of them.

5597
06:00:13,950 --> 06:00:14,470
Ooh, heavy.

5598
06:00:15,770 --> 06:00:16,250
Heavy.

5599
06:00:19,190 --> 06:00:19,630
All right.

5600
06:00:20,070 --> 06:00:21,230
To fishing town!

5601
06:00:25,250 --> 06:00:26,250
Uh, I'm struck.

5602
06:00:26,550 --> 06:00:26,670
Okay.

5603
06:00:29,030 --> 06:00:29,990
Mom, that was so fun.

5604
06:00:30,490 --> 06:00:31,390
The makeup was awesome.

5605
06:00:31,510 --> 06:00:32,510
I hope the fact that all your stuff...

5606
06:00:32,530 --> 06:00:35,370
stuff was so in demand and how all big your lines are.

5607
06:00:35,630 --> 06:00:37,830
Did you realize how much we all love you?

5608
06:00:37,930 --> 06:00:38,870
Thank you.

5609
06:00:41,030 --> 06:00:41,830
Thank you.

5610
06:00:44,910 --> 06:00:49,430
I I don't know why.

5611
06:00:52,950 --> 06:00:55,750
So you think how close you got considering everything that
happened this year?

5612
06:00:56,130 --> 06:00:58,210
Also, you did so many other things on your cool list.

5613
06:00:58,630 --> 06:00:59,510
That's true too.

5614
06:00:59,690 --> 06:01:06,110
Also, you know, there was a lot of times when I just
couldn't stream because I was out doing other things or

5615
06:01:06,110 --> 06:01:13,270
working on other stuff, so you know, ultimately, maybe if I
was able to stream some more, I could have gotten closer,

5616
06:01:13,590 --> 06:01:16,010
but yeah.

5617
06:01:19,490 --> 06:01:32,170
Oh, it's like I just, you know, I think, I have a lot of, I
have a lot of things I want to not change, but like more

5618
06:01:32,170 --> 06:01:41,690
stuff I want to do in 2026 so Pyrobug thank you so much for
the Tony get that thank you uh there's a lot more um things

5619
06:01:41,690 --> 06:01:47,390
that I especially just in general want to give back to you
guys so um

5620
06:01:53,200 --> 06:02:00,080
not that I'm wishing for it to take this long it'd be crazy
if it hit it right before Halloween no yeah I could what you

5621
06:02:00,080 --> 06:02:09,580
mean though gotta break for your health yeah yeah I guess,
you know, it's less of like a...

5622
06:02:09,580 --> 06:02:11,740
Oh, I'm sad, that number not big.

5623
06:02:12,120 --> 06:02:15,640
And more of just like, you know, when you set a goal for
yourself, you want to reach it.

5624
06:02:16,940 --> 06:02:22,220
And when you don't, you feel a little like, ah, is it...

5625
06:02:22,220 --> 06:02:23,480
What could I have done better?

5626
06:02:23,580 --> 06:02:24,060
Is it me?

5627
06:02:24,220 --> 06:02:26,320
Am I, you know...

5628
06:02:26,320 --> 06:02:30,400
Am I not likable enough or such?

5629
06:02:31,060 --> 06:02:33,280
I don't know, but...

5630
06:02:39,340 --> 06:02:40,400
Goals are still goals.

5631
06:02:40,540 --> 06:02:41,820
They change and you improve.

5632
06:02:42,180 --> 06:02:42,400
Yeah.

5633
06:02:46,940 --> 06:02:48,700
Oh, I thought I missed a road.

5634
06:02:49,020 --> 06:02:49,800
I think I'm good.

5635
06:02:50,480 --> 06:02:51,440
The brainworms.

5636
06:02:52,980 --> 06:02:53,880
Proud of you, Minto.

5637
06:02:54,260 --> 06:02:55,020
Oh, are you?

5638
06:02:55,620 --> 06:02:56,140
Why?

5639
06:02:56,320 --> 06:02:57,220
What did I do?

5640
06:03:04,280 --> 06:03:06,320
I've had many a brainworm.

5641
06:03:07,380 --> 06:03:08,960
I think they, for...

5642
06:03:08,960 --> 06:03:17,500
I think Holiday Matsuri will probably be like one of my last
events that I go to.

5643
06:03:17,720 --> 06:03:24,400
I don't know what it is, but going to events really makes my
brains, my brain, my brain so sad.

5644
06:03:25,780 --> 06:03:26,520
I don't know what it is.

5645
06:03:34,520 --> 06:03:38,060
And there might be a few other things that I go to.

5646
06:03:38,960 --> 06:03:39,800
planned but

5647
06:03:44,300 --> 06:03:46,800
I don't think it's a post con depression thing.

5648
06:03:47,240 --> 06:03:52,480
It's while I'm at the con that I'm like feeling it.

5649
06:03:53,860 --> 06:03:54,180
I don't know.

5650
06:03:54,360 --> 06:03:54,920
It was so weird.

5651
06:03:55,080 --> 06:03:55,620
It did so well.

5652
06:03:55,720 --> 06:03:56,320
We love you.

5653
06:03:56,420 --> 06:03:57,560
Thank you.

5654
06:03:58,480 --> 06:03:59,240
Oh boy.

5655
06:03:59,460 --> 06:03:59,820
Yeah.

5656
06:04:00,680 --> 06:04:04,920
I have a lot of stuff planned for a 2026 thought I'm excited
for.

5657
06:04:05,100 --> 06:04:09,200
Things I want to try and patting brainworms away.

5658
06:04:09,260 --> 06:04:09,980
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

5659
06:04:10,560 --> 06:04:11,160
Thank you.

5660
06:04:11,480 --> 06:04:16,920
I set impossible goals for myself at the beginning of every
year so at the end of the year I could use the rage and

5661
06:04:16,920 --> 06:04:19,420
anger of myself to feel next year.

5662
06:04:21,320 --> 06:04:22,700
That's crazy work.

5663
06:04:24,720 --> 06:04:25,400
That's kind of crazy.

5664
06:04:36,260 --> 06:04:36,700
Boids.

5665
06:04:36,700 --> 06:04:37,140
Boid.

5666
06:04:40,480 --> 06:04:42,160
Sometimes I feel more lonely in a crowd.

5667
06:04:44,920 --> 06:04:45,620
Oh my gosh though.

5668
06:04:45,760 --> 06:04:50,500
What's really, what's really painful is if I'm at an event,
and a lot of my friends are there and they're all hanging

5669
06:04:50,500 --> 06:04:58,900
out and I am obviously at the event for you know for for
work so I don't get to hang out with everybody I typically

5670
06:04:58,900 --> 06:05:05,820
have FOMO even if I'm at an event because like I don't get
to hang out with anybody and everybody's out having fun and

5671
06:05:05,820 --> 06:05:07,480
I'm like oh that looks so fun

5672
06:05:11,720 --> 06:05:14,740

That's why we love you.

5686
06:06:18,140 --> 06:06:20,080
My best kamiyoshi for being sick.

Thank you for the gift!

06:06:24,800 --> 06:06:26,100
Get counter-rated.

5690
06:06:26,260 --> 06:06:26,780
Dang it.

5691
06:06:26,880 --> 06:06:29,680
When I was refreshing the chat, I saw that she was
streaming.

5692
06:06:33,480 --> 06:06:34,440
Dang it.

5693
06:06:34,860 --> 06:06:36,240
Hello, Buckeyes.

5694
06:06:38,060 --> 06:06:41,740
I don't even need to ask how amazing Vicky's singing was.

5695
06:06:42,480 --> 06:06:43,280
I already know.

5696
06:06:45,120 --> 06:06:45,840
Hello, you!

5697
06:06:48,420 --> 06:06:49,300
Is it TOS?

5698
06:06:49,380 --> 06:06:50,500
Thank you so much for the 20!

5699
06:06:51,600 --> 06:06:54,020

06:07:56,760 --> 06:07:58,440
It was really CIA-themed.

5708
06:07:58,600 --> 06:07:58,900
Yeah!

5709
06:08:04,810 --> 06:08:07,890
You've rapidly taken over my Vito-beloving heart.

5710
06:08:10,030 --> 06:08:11,590
Wait, where is this place?

5711
06:08:12,190 --> 06:08:12,610
Over here?

5712
06:08:13,570 --> 06:08:14,370
Nope, just kidding.

5713
06:08:19,960 --> 06:08:22,000
The cafe where I am in collab took place.

5714
06:08:22,340 --> 06:08:22,360
Oh.

5715
06:08:23,320 --> 06:08:24,340
Cafe asan.

5716
06:08:26,480 --> 06:08:27,540
Oh, here we go.

5717
06:08:37,400 --> 06:08:38,000
Yep.

5718
06:08:38,020 --> 06:08:39,200
Wee!

5719
06:08:39,200 --> 06:08:40,400
Okay, big money.

5720
06:08:40,860 --> 06:08:41,660
Big extra money.

5721
06:08:42,260 --> 06:08:44,180
Alright, let's go get our ice chains now.

5722
06:08:48,600 --> 06:08:51,220
I don't even know how a cafe can be Cia-A-B's.

5723
06:08:51,840 --> 06:08:53,220
What is the menu?

5724
06:08:53,920 --> 06:08:56,220
Like, you get...

5725
06:08:56,220 --> 06:08:57,620
You get the...

5726
06:08:57,620 --> 06:09:01,120
The Wanted List Pasta or something.

5727
06:09:01,380 --> 06:09:01,900
I don't know.

5728
06:09:02,980 --> 06:09:04,980
You get the...

5729
06:09:06,940 --> 06:09:09,080
Is it Burger Mysteries?

5730
06:09:09,180 --> 06:09:09,680
I don't know.

5731
06:09:10,700 --> 06:09:11,360
Guns.

5732
06:09:11,500 --> 06:09:12,220
Just guns.

5733
06:09:16,030 --> 06:09:18,390
I'm also going to get some more gas.

5734
06:09:29,000 --> 06:09:30,520
Menu is classified.

5735
06:09:31,660 --> 06:09:32,420
Oh, that's good.

5736
06:09:34,060 --> 06:09:37,520
Yeah, unfortunately we lost so many fun themed cafes.

5737
06:09:39,920 --> 06:09:41,740
Especially in like COVID.

5738
06:09:42,260 --> 06:09:42,700
Cat.

5739
06:09:44,240 --> 06:09:44,460
Wait.

5740
06:09:45,680 --> 06:09:48,900
Look at the name of the song.

5741
06:09:51,560 --> 06:09:54,420
Sorry, every time I click out of the game, it stops the
audio.

5742
06:09:57,620 --> 06:09:59,300
Usually lurk, but you cheered up two of my next misses.

5743
06:09:59,420 --> 06:09:59,800
Thank you.

5744
06:09:59,920 --> 06:10:00,620
Thank you.

5745
06:10:02,540 --> 06:10:04,700
I think I think I will go get some water.

5746
06:10:05,340 --> 06:10:08,300
Menu is almost entirely redacted, so it's basically gotcha.

5747
06:10:10,100 --> 06:10:14,460
When people are at Godless view, it is for you, not because
you happen to be there as part of a corporal group, but as

5748
06:10:14,460 --> 06:10:16,040
an independent of your true copy, you see this.

5749
06:10:16,140 --> 06:10:16,700
Thank you.

5750
06:10:17,260 --> 06:10:18,080
Thank you, guys.

5751
06:10:18,340 --> 06:10:18,880
Thank you.

5752
06:10:24,410 --> 06:10:29,730
I'm glad I go get drink real quick I'll be right back wait

5753
06:10:36,860 --> 06:10:38,620

5754
06:10:46,960 --> 06:10:52,600
okay this should be better yeah it's better okay I'll be
right back

5755
06:12:04,680 --> 06:12:12,250
Thank you for all the little ghosts in the room.

5756
06:12:13,310 --> 06:12:16,750
George Costanza with Minto is killing me.

5757
06:12:17,650 --> 06:12:18,810
It's iconic.

5758
06:12:24,670 --> 06:12:25,750
Where's the gas?

5759
06:12:25,850 --> 06:12:26,870
Oh, we're at pizza.

5760
06:12:27,130 --> 06:12:27,810
I keep forgetting.

5761
06:12:29,790 --> 06:12:32,950
Oh my gosh, is your profile picture?

5762
06:12:33,250 --> 06:12:35,370
Is your profile picture?

5763
06:12:35,530 --> 06:12:36,310
Hattori Heiji.

5764
06:12:39,790 --> 06:12:40,750
Happy birthday!

5765
06:12:42,370 --> 06:12:45,630
I hope you had a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, amazing,
amazing, amazing.

5766
06:12:46,070 --> 06:12:47,410
Super fun, super fun, super fun.

5767
06:12:47,810 --> 06:12:47,830
Birthday!

5768
06:12:57,560 --> 06:13:00,660
I feel bad for anybody whose birthday is around this time.

5769
06:13:01,680 --> 06:13:06,300
Your birthday, if your birthday is, like, close to
Christmas, you have the whole, like...

5770
06:13:06,300 --> 06:13:08,540
Oh, my presents are doubled up.

5771
06:13:08,900 --> 06:13:12,040
Oh, my birthday is turned into a Christmas celebration
instead.

5772
06:13:13,860 --> 06:13:14,340
Hmm.

5773
06:13:15,160 --> 06:13:18,140
I wish there was a way we could make you feel more included
in your own stuff and meetups.

5774
06:13:18,260 --> 06:13:20,040
You deserve it, but it's a tough spot to be in.

5775
06:13:20,160 --> 06:13:20,440
Yeah.

5776
06:13:21,880 --> 06:13:22,460
Oh, sorry.

5777
06:13:22,900 --> 06:13:24,380
I didn't mean to have my tongue come out.

5778
06:13:24,520 --> 06:13:25,580
I'm eating raspberries.

5779
06:13:29,100 --> 06:13:31,100
Hope you had a nice Crimbo Christmas.

5780
06:13:34,120 --> 06:13:35,240
Serpent Eater was PM.

5781
06:13:35,340 --> 06:13:35,840
Thank you.

5782
06:13:35,900 --> 06:13:37,060
Looking forward to the Jazz Night.

5783
06:13:37,140 --> 06:13:38,800
You have more big funds in 2026.

5784
06:13:39,500 --> 06:13:41,840
PS, did you see Big Zadu posted his annual holiday event?

5785
06:13:42,320 --> 06:13:43,660
No, I didn't.

5786
06:13:43,780 --> 06:13:44,780
I'll have to go watch it.

5787
06:13:46,900 --> 06:13:47,340
Grimbo.

5788
06:13:50,660 --> 06:13:51,800
You again, eh?

5789
06:13:52,400 --> 06:13:55,100
I hate to say it, but you're a real hard worker.

5790
06:13:56,820 --> 06:13:59,100
It gets real lonely out here, and I don't hate your visits.

5791
06:14:00,000 --> 06:14:01,900
But I've got to charge you 3450.

5792
06:14:02,740 --> 06:14:03,360
Now go away.

5793
06:14:04,760 --> 06:14:05,640
Thank you.

5794
06:14:08,680 --> 06:14:09,840
My birthday is Gen 6.

5795
06:14:10,140 --> 06:14:13,280
It was not close to Christmas growing up, but in recent
years is also associated.

5796
06:14:13,740 --> 06:14:13,940
Ah.

5797
06:14:14,460 --> 06:14:15,160
Oh, no.

5798
06:14:15,460 --> 06:14:15,980
Oh, no.

5799
06:14:17,960 --> 06:14:27,680
It always is bad to have like a birthday, you know, around a
strange time or like, you know, yeah.

5800
06:14:28,900 --> 06:14:29,640
Oh no!

5801
06:14:34,300 --> 06:14:36,980
Oh, whoop, whoop, whoop, there we go.

5802
06:14:45,370 --> 06:14:53,630
I guess I feel like the whole Christmas is like, yeah, it's
pretty rough.

5803
06:14:54,890 --> 06:15:01,350
also you can't really have like a birthday party on your
like as a kid you can't have a birthday party on your

5804
06:15:01,350 --> 06:15:06,470
birthday because your friends will be spending time with
their family and all so

5805
06:15:13,490 --> 06:15:20,690
drift drift drift all right let's go get these chains on us
and then we'll head over to

5806
06:15:24,930 --> 06:15:27,550
head to wait i went the wrong way

5807
06:15:31,210 --> 06:15:40,610
January January I think so do ghosts even celebrate
birthdays well like okay my birthday is like the day I was I

5808
06:15:40,610 --> 06:15:55,750
became a ghost so it's like it's like the birth of it's my
death day but I was born into a ghost so I don't know it

5809
06:15:55,750 --> 06:16:02,630
depends on how you you know I just call it birthday
otherwise You know, I don't want you guys to get all

5810
06:16:02,630 --> 06:16:03,570
confused and all.

5811
06:16:07,590 --> 06:16:09,790
I'm always thinking to you guys.

5812
06:16:15,610 --> 06:16:16,490
Ice chains.

5813
06:16:17,410 --> 06:16:17,490
Oh?

5814
06:16:18,330 --> 06:16:21,810
It's been so nice to play with all our friends the last few
days.

5815
06:16:22,730 --> 06:16:24,650
MK must miss Seb so much.

5816
06:16:25,910 --> 06:16:29,870
I can't imagine not having my closest friend while everyone
else has found each other.

5817
06:16:30,810 --> 06:16:31,750
Ice chains.

5818
06:16:32,110 --> 06:16:33,750
You should help you keep your speed on the ice.

5819
06:16:34,310 --> 06:16:35,890
That will cost $2.99.

5820
06:16:38,210 --> 06:16:39,510
Thank you very much.

5821
06:16:41,850 --> 06:16:42,750
All set.

5822
06:16:49,050 --> 06:16:51,110
Head to the factory just west of Mountain Town.

5823
06:16:52,030 --> 06:16:52,810
Let's go, baby.

5824
06:17:02,990 --> 06:17:03,790
All right.

5825
06:17:04,690 --> 06:17:05,610
Turn around.

5826
06:17:07,290 --> 06:17:08,310
And we're good to go.

5827
06:17:10,130 --> 06:17:11,730
Mountain Town delivery, too.

5828
06:17:11,890 --> 06:17:13,110
I don't think we need to.

5829
06:17:13,130 --> 06:17:14,350
I need more money, do we?

5830
06:17:18,540 --> 06:17:18,740
Oops.

5831
06:17:19,360 --> 06:17:19,360
Oops.

5832
06:17:19,760 --> 06:17:21,080
My car is so sensitive.

5833
06:17:23,820 --> 06:17:25,120
Wonder if we can drive across the lake.

5834
06:17:25,220 --> 06:17:26,280
I think so.

5835
06:17:27,120 --> 06:17:30,440
But the factory is over this way, so we gotta go back.

5836
06:17:32,660 --> 06:17:33,120
$500.

5837
06:17:33,760 --> 06:17:34,920
Oh, don't say that.

5838
06:17:35,440 --> 06:17:38,440
If it's real, I'll cry.

5839
06:17:38,980 --> 06:17:40,880
I'll get the... I'll get the...

5840
06:17:41,520 --> 06:17:42,920
The fishing rod or something.

5841
06:17:53,520 --> 06:17:54,000
Oh.

5842
06:17:54,020 --> 06:17:55,200
I love raspberry.

5843
06:18:00,190 --> 06:18:01,970
Okay, we are at...

5844
06:18:03,250 --> 06:18:03,930
Eastern.

5845
06:18:04,250 --> 06:18:05,930
We need to go to West.

5846
06:18:06,670 --> 06:18:07,870
It is over there, right?

5847
06:18:09,690 --> 06:18:11,770
Pretty sure that's it right there.

5848
06:18:14,010 --> 06:18:14,290
Yumbo.

5849
06:18:14,910 --> 06:18:16,330
When is raspberry season?

5850
06:18:17,650 --> 06:18:18,270
Is it now?

5851
06:18:29,100 --> 06:18:29,760
Summer.

5852
06:18:33,820 --> 06:18:35,440
But it's not now.

5853
06:18:35,940 --> 06:18:36,220
Oops.

5854
06:18:37,980 --> 06:18:40,860
They're still delicious, don't get me wrong.

5855
06:18:42,160 --> 06:18:44,560
I think it's August, I see.

5856
06:18:44,740 --> 06:18:44,920
Oh!

5857
06:18:49,300 --> 06:18:51,360
Mid-Summer Wars.

5858
06:18:53,680 --> 06:18:56,040
Well, they're still yummy.

5859
06:18:57,940 --> 06:18:59,540
It ain't Rashpin Time.

5860
06:19:00,320 --> 06:19:00,840
Factory.

5861
06:19:02,760 --> 06:19:03,620
Here we go!

5862
06:19:06,580 --> 06:19:08,140
This place is new.

5863
06:19:09,220 --> 06:19:09,600
Exciting.

5864
06:19:12,520 --> 06:19:13,980
I was just gonna ignore him.

5865
06:19:22,720 --> 06:19:23,220
Hello.

5866
06:19:26,620 --> 06:19:27,900
You've got the ice chains?

5867
06:19:28,580 --> 06:19:28,820
Good.

5868
06:19:29,060 --> 06:19:30,400
It's a straight shot to the factory.

5869
06:19:30,800 --> 06:19:31,600
You'll need some speed.

5870
06:19:32,400 --> 06:19:34,160
I'll radio you once you're inside.

5871
06:19:35,060 --> 06:19:38,140
I would go with you, but my programming doesn't seem to
allow it.

5872
06:19:39,600 --> 06:19:40,840
months to get in.

5873
06:19:41,060 --> 06:19:42,060
Ever since...

5874
06:19:42,060 --> 06:19:42,500
Anyway.

5875
06:19:43,140 --> 06:19:44,080
Ever since SEB!

5876
06:19:47,200 --> 06:19:48,700
Yeah, it's orange season.

5877
06:19:48,900 --> 06:19:49,260
It's awesome.

5878
06:19:52,880 --> 06:19:55,160
Make sure to top up on energy before heading in.

5879
06:19:56,020 --> 06:19:56,760
Good luck in there.

5880
06:19:58,600 --> 06:20:02,740
I have one cup of coffee.

5881
06:20:04,620 --> 06:20:05,880
We'll go get some more.

5882
06:20:06,420 --> 06:20:06,600
Oops.

5883
06:20:07,420 --> 06:20:08,340

5887
06:20:47,980 --> 06:20:49,040
Like, dirt from heaven.

5888
06:20:50,020 --> 06:20:51,080
Yeah, okay, great, good.

5889
06:21:00,170 --> 06:21:01,270
Scenarius, gray.

5890
06:21:01,690 --> 06:21:02,330
Welcome to membership.

5891
06:21:02,630 --> 06:21:03,410
Thank you.

5892
06:21:05,650 --> 06:21:06,470
Rain and dirt.

5893
06:21:07,890 --> 06:21:08,430
Okay, sorry.

5894
06:21:08,610 --> 06:21:10,650
I think we need to go a little bit out of the way.

5895
06:21:13,290 --> 06:21:13,710
Uh.

5896
06:21:14,450 --> 06:21:17,690
I have to find a store, and I have to find some coffee.

5897
06:21:17,870 --> 06:21:18,150
Okay.

5898
06:21:18,590 --> 06:21:20,030
I'm gonna go...

5899
06:21:20,030 --> 06:21:22,170
I should have never got this dang coffee pot.

5900
06:21:22,270 --> 06:21:32,730
I don't want to spend my money on the firewood because it's
so expensive but I think I will can you buy coffee at the

5901
06:21:32,730 --> 06:21:41,690
bakery I think you buy tea there which is a little different
the tea prevents you from over from freezing but it does not

5902
06:21:41,690 --> 06:21:42,950
replenish your energy

5903
06:21:46,330 --> 06:21:54,070
you could use on his cat oh I could okay thank you that's so
true you're right you're right you're right But I need to

5904
06:21:54,070 --> 06:21:56,270
get a store- wait, um...

5905
06:21:57,410 --> 06:21:58,730
Is there a store up here?

5906
06:21:58,930 --> 06:21:59,570
Am I crazy?

5907
06:22:01,350 --> 06:22:03,790
Wait, let's go down.

5908
06:22:07,110 --> 06:22:07,630
Nice.

5909
06:22:09,270 --> 06:22:09,670
Nice.

5910
06:22:10,830 --> 06:22:10,990
Nice.

5911
06:22:11,850 --> 06:22:11,850
Nice.

5912
06:22:13,610 --> 06:22:13,810
Nice.

5913
06:22:14,790 --> 06:22:15,230
Nice.

5914
06:22:16,250 --> 06:22:16,470
Okay.

5915
06:22:18,770 --> 06:22:19,290
Oh,

5916
06:22:22,980 --> 06:22:23,980
sorry, I was scratching my head.

5917
06:22:25,260 --> 06:22:26,280
Like a monkey.

5918
06:22:28,440 --> 06:22:28,840
Wrong way.

5919
06:22:29,360 --> 06:22:30,160
Wrong way, Gim.

5920
06:22:35,000 --> 06:22:35,600
Oh!

5921
06:22:37,140 --> 06:22:39,260
Good thing we have no deliveries, huh?

5922
06:22:41,000 --> 06:22:41,600
Minky!

5923
06:22:49,910 --> 06:22:52,070
We just gotta go find a grocery store.

5924
06:22:52,270 --> 06:22:53,370
Oh, come on!

5925
06:22:56,830 --> 06:23:00,740
Game didn't put me backwards.

5926
06:23:00,980 --> 06:23:02,680
I'd be fine.

5927
06:23:04,820 --> 06:23:05,540
Okay, there we go.

5928
06:23:06,780 --> 06:23:07,900
There she goes.

5929
06:23:09,780 --> 06:23:10,980
There she blows.

5930
06:23:15,410 --> 06:23:16,930
Where's the dang grocery store?

5931
06:23:18,010 --> 06:23:19,190
I'm starving here.

5932
06:23:20,490 --> 06:23:21,870
What is this food desert?

5933
06:23:31,730 --> 06:23:32,490
Uh-oh.

5934
06:23:37,660 --> 06:23:39,220
Alright, let's find a place.

5935
06:23:41,200 --> 06:23:41,660
Hmm.

5936
06:23:44,500 --> 06:23:46,000
Looking for a grocery store.

5937
06:23:47,660 --> 06:23:49,180
Looking for a grocery store.

5938
06:23:49,980 --> 06:23:51,020
That's the bakery.

5939
06:23:55,220 --> 06:23:56,660
Insurance premiums just...

5940
06:23:56,660 --> 06:23:57,940
No, no, no, no.

5941
06:23:58,120 --> 06:23:59,580
Just don't report it.

5942
06:24:02,160 --> 06:24:02,840
Here we go!

5943
06:24:03,840 --> 06:24:05,600
Uh-oh, my energy is so low.

5944
06:24:10,920 --> 06:24:11,920
Coffee powder.

5945
06:24:14,580 --> 06:24:16,580
ST-49 terminated.

5946
06:24:17,220 --> 06:24:17,820
Offline!

5947
06:24:20,240 --> 06:24:21,360
Have an easy day.

5948
06:24:21,760 --> 06:24:23,500
That will cost you...

5949
06:24:24,120 --> 06:24:25,620
I'll just be here.

5950
06:24:27,680 --> 06:24:28,780
That should be enough, right?

5951
06:24:35,210 --> 06:24:37,190
Actually, I'll buy one more.

5952
06:24:41,240 --> 06:24:42,620
He's been terminated!

5953
06:24:42,800 --> 06:24:43,260
He's offline!

5954
06:24:45,240 --> 06:24:46,040
Okay.

5955
06:24:48,080 --> 06:24:48,880
Let's...

5956
06:24:50,340 --> 06:24:52,280
Let's get to...

5957
06:24:53,300 --> 06:24:54,120
Our friend!

5958
06:24:54,500 --> 06:24:55,480
Okay, perfect.

5959
06:25:00,920 --> 06:25:02,440
Numbers, what do they mean?

5960
06:25:16,380 --> 06:25:18,580
Oh wait, I think I need my pot first.

5961
06:25:23,610 --> 06:25:24,210
No.

5962
06:25:25,330 --> 06:25:25,930
No.

5963
06:25:26,590 --> 06:25:26,910
Please.

5964
06:25:29,930 --> 06:25:31,230
Why can't I use it?

5965
06:25:39,050 --> 06:25:40,670
Oh my god.

5966
06:25:47,510 --> 06:25:48,930
We got scammed.

5967
06:25:50,170 --> 06:25:52,070
We got scammed for real.

5968
06:25:53,630 --> 06:25:54,590
Oh man.

5969
06:25:54,910 --> 06:25:56,090
Okay, I'll go buy one.

5970
06:25:57,450 --> 06:25:58,750
He literally said it can be used on...

5971
06:25:58,750 --> 06:25:59,770
I'm not blaming you.

5972
06:26:00,830 --> 06:26:02,790
I'm not blaming whoever suggested it in the chat.

5973
06:26:03,110 --> 06:26:04,690
You were so smart for thinking that.

5974
06:26:05,490 --> 06:26:06,890
The game lied to us.

5975
06:26:08,650 --> 06:26:10,790
Luckily, the store is just a short ways away.

5976
06:26:10,890 --> 06:26:12,810
It's just that the firewood is sold.

5977
06:26:12,910 --> 06:26:14,110
Darn, expansive.

5978
06:26:15,330 --> 06:26:17,430
I really don't think we need any more.

5979
06:26:20,270 --> 06:26:23,530
I don't think we need any more money, though.

5980
06:26:23,690 --> 06:26:25,090
I think we're about at endgame.

5981
06:26:27,430 --> 06:26:28,470
I blame you, chat.

5982
06:26:29,230 --> 06:26:30,590
I could never, I could never.

5983
06:26:33,750 --> 06:26:35,630
I'm scared of, like, using this wrong.

5984
06:26:39,900 --> 06:26:40,440
You know?

5985
06:26:47,570 --> 06:26:47,890
Leave.

5986
06:26:48,050 --> 06:26:48,430
There we go.

5987
06:27:00,740 --> 06:27:01,540
My dog!

5988
06:27:01,800 --> 06:27:03,460
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

5989
06:27:06,680 --> 06:27:08,180
You're really talented and creative person.

5990
06:27:08,340 --> 06:27:09,660
We throw the Jurassic Park Arcade stream.

5991
06:27:09,840 --> 06:27:10,820
It is an August heavy rolling.

5992
06:27:10,940 --> 06:27:11,900
My world is brighter with...

5993
06:27:11,900 --> 06:27:12,820
Ah, stop!

5994
06:27:13,520 --> 06:27:14,480
Thank you, Dan.

5995
06:27:14,600 --> 06:27:16,140
Thank you so much!

5996
06:27:17,800 --> 06:27:18,320
Thank you!

5997
06:27:25,630 --> 06:27:26,910
Okay, we're heating up.

5998
06:27:26,990 --> 06:27:27,550
We're heating up.

5999
06:27:39,240 --> 06:27:40,060
Run, run, run.

6000
06:27:47,120 --> 06:27:47,760
Okay.

6001
06:27:53,320 --> 06:27:54,140
Place pot.

6002
06:27:54,700 --> 06:27:54,940
Perfect.

6003
06:27:55,760 --> 06:27:57,460
Oh my god, we're doing it!

6004
06:27:58,120 --> 06:27:59,740
We're doing it!

6005
06:28:01,320 --> 06:28:03,020
Okay, so you only need two for a thing.

6006
06:28:04,860 --> 06:28:05,100
Perfect.

6007
06:28:07,080 --> 06:28:08,940
Are you guys fighting?

6008
06:28:19,920 --> 06:28:20,300
Cook.

6009
06:28:21,400 --> 06:28:22,900
My homemade coffee.

6010
06:28:23,800 --> 06:28:25,200
Yeah, would you drink it?

6011
06:28:25,840 --> 06:28:27,460
I think this is actually dirt.

6012
06:28:28,380 --> 06:28:31,240
This is the dirt that the bakery person was talking about.

6013
06:28:39,180 --> 06:28:40,640
Alright, let's drink a cup.

6014
06:28:41,960 --> 06:28:45,200
Actually, I'm gonna have one later when we get there.

6015
06:28:47,400 --> 06:28:49,500
We'll top off there so I don't waste any.

6016
06:28:50,480 --> 06:28:56,920
I don't even know if, like, I need this much, but better to
be safe than sorry.

6017
06:29:05,970 --> 06:29:07,670
He said we need speed, huh?

6018
06:29:10,370 --> 06:29:11,230
into Minto, huh?

6019
06:29:11,610 --> 06:29:12,570
Oh, the coffee?

6020
06:29:13,850 --> 06:29:15,230
Oh my god.

6021
06:29:17,150 --> 06:29:18,370
That guy was just like...

6022
06:29:19,250 --> 06:29:19,990
Oh yeah.

6023
06:29:20,290 --> 06:29:22,030
I don't know if he should be drinking that anymore.

6024
06:29:26,260 --> 06:29:26,920
Oh my god.

6025
06:29:27,120 --> 06:29:28,320
Go, go, go, go, go.

6026
06:29:29,720 --> 06:29:31,860
I think it's coming after us.

6027
06:29:35,120 --> 06:29:35,600
Woo!

6028
06:29:35,720 --> 06:29:36,820
We made it!

6029
06:29:40,450 --> 06:29:43,850
Apparently, there was like some people that he gave expired
to.

6030
06:29:43,970 --> 06:29:44,690
or something.

6031
06:29:45,770 --> 06:29:47,950
And he was like, no, no, for me, it was fine.

6032
06:29:48,490 --> 06:29:50,790
But he was like, it's been so long now, I wouldn't.

6033
06:29:51,170 --> 06:29:52,490
I probably wouldn't anymore.

6034
06:29:54,890 --> 06:29:56,150
Okay, let's drink that coffee.

6035
06:29:58,590 --> 06:30:00,330
Does coffee really expire, though?

6036
06:30:05,860 --> 06:30:07,380
Real minto hours.

6037
06:30:07,660 --> 06:30:07,900
Yeah!

6038
06:30:11,560 --> 06:30:13,240
Yes, really fast.

6039
06:30:13,940 --> 06:30:15,140
It can mold.

6040
06:30:16,240 --> 06:30:17,020
No way.

6041
06:30:17,240 --> 06:30:17,520
Seriously?

6042
06:30:17,540 --> 06:30:17,880
Seriously!

6043
06:30:19,720 --> 06:30:22,440
Head to the factory just west of Mountain Town.

6044
06:30:24,820 --> 06:30:26,380
Our goal is to buy the fishing rod.

6045
06:30:32,110 --> 06:30:34,190
It goes stale at least.

6046
06:30:38,780 --> 06:30:40,460
Even bottled water expire.

6047
06:30:40,580 --> 06:30:41,300
I guess that's true.

6048
06:30:42,220 --> 06:30:42,840
Wait, what's happening?

6049
06:30:45,180 --> 06:30:45,780
Leave?

6050
06:30:46,260 --> 06:30:46,400
Oh.

6051
06:30:47,180 --> 06:30:47,480
Yeah.

6052
06:30:56,970 --> 06:30:58,270
Let's get my lighter out.

6053
06:31:07,760 --> 06:31:10,560
Ground copy stales faster than whole beans, though.

6054
06:31:10,900 --> 06:31:11,560
Let's see it.

6055
06:31:12,900 --> 06:31:14,600
Maybe I'm safe, I don't know.

6056
06:31:18,480 --> 06:31:19,880
What is this factory for?

6057
06:31:20,020 --> 06:31:22,420
We're in here, but...

6058
06:31:22,420 --> 06:31:23,920
Do you copy?

6059
06:31:24,840 --> 06:31:25,120
Great.

6060
06:31:25,860 --> 06:31:27,400
Try to find a control center.

6061
06:31:38,490 --> 06:31:39,010
Hey.

6062
06:31:39,790 --> 06:31:41,150
I never got your name.

6063
06:31:41,710 --> 06:31:42,770
I'm sorry for all this.

6064
06:31:46,550 --> 06:31:49,510
When he started up, I really thought Seb had come back.

6065
06:31:50,270 --> 06:31:58,250
Seems like Iziko really is shut down cloud-computed agents
for good.

6066
06:32:15,260 --> 06:32:20,000
So, I guess we are like, we are Seb, but not really.

6067
06:32:27,810 --> 06:32:30,190
Maybe Seb without the memories or something.

6068
06:32:41,240 --> 06:32:42,140
friend back.

6069
06:32:43,400 --> 06:32:44,180
So sad.

6070
06:32:47,300 --> 06:32:49,140
Same character, but different player.

6071
06:32:49,540 --> 06:32:50,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6072
06:32:51,960 --> 06:32:53,280
Seb and I were friends.

6073
06:32:54,560 --> 06:32:55,440
Good friends.

6074
06:32:56,820 --> 06:32:58,840
They were a little rigid around the edges.

6075
06:33:00,000 --> 06:33:04,200
But we became as close of friends as two ML agents could be.

6076
06:33:05,000 --> 06:33:05,360
ML?

6077
06:33:09,440 --> 06:33:17,420
Seb supported my dream of one day leaving this place i
thought was terrible but i think their heart was here with

6078
06:33:17,420 --> 06:33:23,600
the shop keepers imagine living life as someone who is
already existing person just having to talk to their friend

6079
06:33:23,600 --> 06:33:35,560
without knowing oh i know mario luigi oh they saw each other
a lot more through the deliveries i was just fixing things

6080
06:33:35,560 --> 06:33:48,700
in the background sep ultimately gave up their job to be
with me what is over here anyway i'm just running into walls

6081
06:34:01,480 --> 06:34:06,240
i love the way they hop around when they walk i wish i could
walk more in the game because it's so cute

6082
06:34:12,460 --> 06:34:22,320
after seb shut down all i wanted was to join them that's why
i was trying so hard to get into the factory But it's been

6083
06:34:22,320 --> 06:34:25,940
really nice seeing the shopkeepers blossom into their own
selves.

6084
06:34:26,560 --> 06:34:27,040
Have they?

6085
06:34:27,480 --> 06:34:28,600
They're kind of freaky.

6086
06:34:29,780 --> 06:34:31,600
All I want now is to keep them safe.

6087
06:34:32,980 --> 06:34:33,660
For Seb.

6088
06:34:35,260 --> 06:34:36,760
Even if it means rebooting them.

6089
06:34:41,900 --> 06:34:43,180
We must reboot them.

6090
06:34:44,600 --> 06:34:45,800
Oh, is this the control?

6091
06:34:48,700 --> 06:34:48,980
Ooh.

6092
06:34:51,000 --> 06:34:51,600
Choose.

6093
06:34:52,040 --> 06:34:52,280
Choose.

6094
06:34:55,280 --> 06:35:05,400
this this when i first started up the game it actually had
like this this started up like this easy call recovery disk

6095
06:35:05,400 --> 06:35:08,260
unavailable st units hydropower

6096
06:35:13,040 --> 06:35:14,990
oh wait what

6097
06:35:21,220 --> 06:35:33,760
sometimes being your own self is being freaky miss freak
phantom spread his code where the endings are yeah what does

6098
06:35:33,760 --> 06:35:37,360
it mean though sd units or hydropower

6099
06:35:55,690 --> 06:36:02,590
i'm guessing sd units means the shopkeepers and hydropower
means sub or something

6100
06:36:08,140 --> 06:36:10,400
SD unit sounds like you'd be spread in the code.

6101
06:36:10,560 --> 06:36:11,240
That's so true.

6102
06:36:11,760 --> 06:36:13,200
Let's try SD units.

6103
06:36:18,880 --> 06:36:20,000
False present.

6104
06:36:20,540 --> 06:36:21,220
Oh yeah, here we go.

6105
06:36:21,480 --> 06:36:22,440
Reboot, wait.

6106
06:36:22,880 --> 06:36:24,840
Reboot SD units.

6107
06:36:27,140 --> 06:36:29,580
Reboot some personality may be lost.

6108
06:36:31,740 --> 06:36:32,020
No.

6109
06:36:38,460 --> 06:36:42,640
Hydro power shuts everyone down while SD unit just resets
every way's personality.

6110
06:36:42,640 --> 06:36:56,280
will they even be themselves then some of them were kind of
jerks anyway no the gas they were just sundere the gas the

6111
06:36:56,280 --> 06:37:07,540
gas store they were fine you need the recovery disc to save
the personalities ah which i didn't get dang that's okay

6112
06:37:07,540 --> 06:37:19,300
reboot have an easy day reboot is what i got achievement do
you copy it looks like you didn't need my help after all

6113
06:37:19,300 --> 06:37:35,980
you've brought our friends peace for now I'm the only one
who will ever know I'll look after them with great care it

6114
06:37:35,980 --> 06:37:46,580
just doesn't feel right keeping them in this cycle amelia
thank you so much for the redirect hello hello all my

6115
06:37:46,580 --> 06:38:02,720
friends are redirecting into me today thank you we're at the
end of the game though so spoiler spoiler warning there has

6116
06:38:02,720 --> 06:38:06,140
to be another way i guess you have to thank you so much for
the gift

6117
06:38:09,540 --> 06:38:10,480
Spreading the code?

6118
06:38:10,600 --> 06:38:11,460
I'm spreading my code?

6119
06:38:11,880 --> 06:38:12,740
I'm spreading the code?

6120
06:38:13,500 --> 06:38:13,500
What?

6121
06:38:23,180 --> 06:38:25,120
Oh my gosh, wait, that's the ending?

6122
06:38:26,300 --> 06:38:27,660
No way, that's it!

6123
06:38:29,620 --> 06:38:30,840
Oh, that's it!

6124
06:38:33,360 --> 06:38:35,220
Faith Valray, thank you!

6125
06:38:35,560 --> 06:38:36,580
Thank you, thank you!

6126
06:38:38,960 --> 06:38:40,900
That's it, I was so sad!

6127
06:38:42,060 --> 06:38:44,140
I just rebooted them and that was it.

6128
06:38:45,760 --> 06:38:46,180
Oh.

6129
06:38:51,180 --> 06:38:52,080
That's so sad.

6130
06:38:52,320 --> 06:38:53,560
I mean, I guess they're fine.

6131
06:38:54,120 --> 06:38:54,160
Maybe?

6132
06:38:57,680 --> 06:38:58,960
I wish I didn't have... Let's see.

6133
06:38:59,020 --> 06:38:59,240
Hold on.

6134
06:38:59,280 --> 06:39:00,520
If I play a new game...

6135
06:39:02,080 --> 06:39:04,560
Oh my gosh, I just realized I never, like, saved or
anything.

6136
06:39:04,920 --> 06:39:06,100
Oh, wait, here we go.

6137
06:39:08,260 --> 06:39:09,840
If I resume...

6138
06:39:09,840 --> 06:39:10,380
Wait, hold on.

6139
06:39:10,400 --> 06:39:12,700
Let's see if I can do the other ending.

6140
06:39:13,960 --> 06:39:14,300
A.D.K.

6141
06:39:14,320 --> 06:39:15,360
who gifted me, but thank you.

6142
06:39:15,480 --> 06:39:16,160
Thank you!

6143
06:39:16,640 --> 06:39:17,420
Wait, where are we?

6144
06:39:18,520 --> 06:39:19,440
Oh, I'm here!

6145
06:39:19,660 --> 06:39:20,500
Let's try... Let's get the ending.

6146
06:39:20,520 --> 06:39:21,100
other ending.

6147
06:39:26,320 --> 06:39:27,840
I need more speed.

6148
06:39:29,000 --> 06:39:32,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6149
06:39:33,420 --> 06:39:39,640
Let's get the other ending, and then I know that there's
probably the third one with the disc I won't be able to get,

6150
06:39:39,700 --> 06:39:40,220
but that's okay.

6151
06:39:42,520 --> 06:39:43,280
Oh my god.

6152
06:39:56,280 --> 06:39:56,880
Let's go.

6153
06:39:58,660 --> 06:40:01,500
I really, I just realized I got all that coffee.

6154
06:40:01,600 --> 06:40:02,880
I really didn't need it at all.

6155
06:40:03,720 --> 06:40:07,400
I was like, imagine if I don't eat all this coffee, and I
was...

6156
06:40:07,400 --> 06:40:07,700
Right?

6157
06:40:09,240 --> 06:40:11,240
You can get the third one right after this.

6158
06:40:11,400 --> 06:40:12,440
No way, really?

6159
06:40:20,580 --> 06:40:22,300
Ice cracking is uncomfy sounding.

6160
06:40:22,460 --> 06:40:23,000
It is!

6161
06:40:23,120 --> 06:40:23,940
I don't like it either.

6162
06:40:28,780 --> 06:40:29,360
Thank you for playing.

6163
06:40:29,440 --> 06:40:30,540
Grab this to play over the weekend.

6164
06:40:30,780 --> 06:40:31,060
Yeah!

6165
06:40:31,340 --> 06:40:34,320
Oh my gosh, if you just want to, like, a vibe...

6166
06:40:34,320 --> 06:40:38,340
vibe and going around game, this is, like, one of those
types of games for real.

6167
06:40:39,920 --> 06:40:41,600
Sorry to stick around to the end, but good night, me though.

6168
06:40:42,000 --> 06:40:44,400
Things are trying to stick around for so long!

6169
06:40:44,520 --> 06:40:45,380
Well, I'm almost done.

6170
06:40:45,640 --> 06:40:47,040
No worries, no worries.

6171
06:40:47,860 --> 06:40:48,720
Strand game.

6172
06:40:49,120 --> 06:40:50,720
It's actual Strand game.

6173
06:40:54,100 --> 06:40:55,200
Okay, let's see.

6174
06:41:04,840 --> 06:41:05,860
Okay, dokey.

6175
06:41:08,720 --> 06:41:11,440
I'll just skip through the dialogue if that's okay,
everybody.

6176
06:41:13,740 --> 06:41:23,080
earlier like dredge yeah oh i missed dredge that was i don't
know the last time i got like so hooked on a game you know

6177
06:41:23,080 --> 06:41:32,900
it's such a good feeling to get like so into a game that
you're like oh my gosh i can't i can't put it down oh i love

6178
06:41:32,900 --> 06:41:48,190
dredge ironically for me at least this game was bundled with
dredge oh really like a like a or something.

6179
06:41:51,790 --> 06:41:54,950
It was like just the right fishing game that I wanted.

6180
06:41:56,230 --> 06:41:58,350
Wait, when did he start contacting me?

6181
06:41:59,950 --> 06:42:01,930
The music in this game is so good.

6182
06:42:02,870 --> 06:42:03,870
I'm gonna get the soundtrack.

6183
06:42:09,480 --> 06:42:11,580
Wait, isn't he supposed to contact me on the walkie?

6184
06:42:25,790 --> 06:42:27,210
Did I watch Akiba Mid Wars?

6185
06:42:27,290 --> 06:42:27,670
I did!

6186
06:42:28,090 --> 06:42:28,430
I did!

6187
06:42:35,600 --> 06:42:37,000
Wait, why isn't he talking?

6188
06:42:38,620 --> 06:42:40,860
Do we spread in code again?

6189
06:42:43,600 --> 06:42:48,160
You know, every time I see you, I automatically go to line
10 because that's what you are.

6190
06:42:48,360 --> 06:42:49,180
A perfect...

6191
06:42:49,180 --> 06:42:50,320
Stab it.

6192
06:42:52,440 --> 06:42:53,480
Oh, he's dead.

6193
06:42:54,440 --> 06:42:55,320
Because I rebooted?

6194
06:43:00,730 --> 06:43:05,450
Wait, I wonder what the other guys are like then.

6195
06:43:06,490 --> 06:43:07,870
Wait, the shopkeepers.

6196
06:43:14,500 --> 06:43:15,100
Wait.

6197
06:43:15,120 --> 06:43:15,580
Wait!

6198
06:43:16,480 --> 06:43:19,300
The save wasn't before the ending, but it was after!

6199
06:43:30,940 --> 06:43:32,980
Oh my gosh, the silence is deafening.

6200
06:43:43,120 --> 06:43:43,640
Julie!

6201
06:43:46,040 --> 06:43:47,400
Welcome to membership!

6202
06:43:47,740 --> 06:43:48,540
Thank you!

6203
06:43:48,760 --> 06:43:49,700
What the heck!

6204
06:43:55,130 --> 06:43:56,590
The music's stopping, so scary.

6205
06:43:59,230 --> 06:44:01,530
I see, like, shut down in there, you know?

6206
06:44:05,090 --> 06:44:07,930
Wait, so if I hydropower?

6207
06:44:09,190 --> 06:44:10,890
Well, I feel like I have to try, you know?

6208
06:44:11,810 --> 06:44:12,690
Let's see.

6209
06:44:13,730 --> 06:44:14,170
Turbine.

6210
06:44:14,530 --> 06:44:15,710
1, 2, 3, 4 status.

6211
06:44:16,610 --> 06:44:18,090
Shut down, hydrodam.

6212
06:44:20,490 --> 06:44:22,210
All shopkeepers will shut down.

6213
06:44:24,510 --> 06:44:25,750
Shut down ending.

6214
06:44:41,010 --> 06:44:43,070
I need to frame step the vine to see that code.

6215
06:44:47,470 --> 06:44:48,330
Is that it?

6216
06:44:57,150 --> 06:45:00,090
We'll go look at the shopkeepers now.

6217
06:45:05,370 --> 06:45:08,510
I just noticed like how crazy looking this factor is.

6218
06:45:13,760 --> 06:45:14,780
I have no radio!

6219
06:45:15,140 --> 06:45:15,820
Oh, just kidding, I do.

6220
06:45:23,720 --> 06:45:24,640
Is that the campfire?

6221
06:45:27,440 --> 06:45:27,980
Wait!

6222
06:45:28,600 --> 06:45:28,920
No.

6223
06:46:04,240 --> 06:46:05,500
They don't talk.

6224
06:46:07,060 --> 06:46:09,100
They're just blank now.

6225
06:46:27,060 --> 06:46:38,690
I can't wait if I like try to buy it it won't let me oh my
gosh can I steal it I stole

6226
06:46:45,120 --> 06:46:57,640
and I was even getting cold in there there's like no
anything I stole um

6227
06:47:01,920 --> 06:47:04,280
Is it easy to get the third end?

6228
06:47:08,220 --> 06:47:09,240
Just keep scanning.

6229
06:47:10,100 --> 06:47:11,540
There's no radio.

6230
06:47:15,170 --> 06:47:17,090
You can just take the recovery disc.

6231
06:47:18,570 --> 06:47:21,350
You have to get a disc, yeah, but where are you at?

6232
06:47:22,630 --> 06:47:23,810
I can tell you where it is.

6233
06:47:25,570 --> 06:47:27,550
Grab the recovery disc now that the shopkeeper...

6234
06:47:27,550 --> 06:47:27,750
Where?

6235
06:47:28,010 --> 06:47:29,710
I don't remember seeing one though.

6236
06:47:30,210 --> 06:47:30,790
Is it in here?

6237
06:47:34,170 --> 06:47:35,430
Oh, the pawn shop.

6238
06:47:39,670 --> 06:47:41,050
It's Easton pawn shop.

6239
06:47:41,170 --> 06:47:41,630
Thank you.

6240
06:47:41,710 --> 06:47:43,070
I think we're in Weston right now.

6241
06:47:45,330 --> 06:47:45,810
Shortcut.

6242
06:47:47,350 --> 06:47:48,770
Alright, we'll do it real fast.

6243
06:47:52,650 --> 06:47:54,030
I don't want to end it like this.

6244
06:47:54,090 --> 06:47:55,630
It would be too depressing, no?

6245
06:47:56,130 --> 06:47:58,070
I feel like I have to complete it.

6246
06:47:59,830 --> 06:48:02,710
I feel like I must do it.

6247
06:48:06,700 --> 06:48:07,640
For Easton.

6248
06:48:10,300 --> 06:48:13,200
But it makes sense that you can just...

6249
06:48:13,200 --> 06:48:15,500
Oh, I'm getting a signal, though.

6250
06:48:17,060 --> 06:48:18,020
I heard some noise.

6251
06:48:18,800 --> 06:48:19,880
Wait, I think I need to go up there.

6252
06:48:20,240 --> 06:48:20,640
Oh, it's fine.

6253
06:48:20,720 --> 06:48:21,280
I'll just do a loop.

6254
06:48:23,100 --> 06:48:24,280
It would be pretty sad.

6255
06:48:24,420 --> 06:48:26,680
Yeah, it's so quiet and everything.

6256
06:48:27,980 --> 06:48:28,980
I don't like it.

6257
06:48:31,980 --> 06:48:32,780
It's scanning.

6258
06:48:32,820 --> 06:48:37,900
I'm getting, like, sometimes something, but...

6259
06:48:37,920 --> 06:48:40,740
develop a funny guy's normal IT conversation

6260
06:48:46,750 --> 06:48:48,850
are there still trains?

6261
06:48:49,170 --> 06:48:51,230
Is that what I just heard?

6262
06:48:51,310 --> 06:48:51,590
Hmm,

6263
06:48:55,270 --> 06:48:58,430
we dubbed the logs doggo.

6264
06:49:00,350 --> 06:49:01,610
Alright, enter.

6265
06:49:06,910 --> 06:49:08,950
Oh, it's $300 usually.

6266
06:49:09,270 --> 06:49:10,310
Oh my gosh!

6267
06:49:13,950 --> 06:49:16,890
Oh, thank goodness I didn't think I had to buy it.

6268
06:49:21,610 --> 06:49:22,090
Yoink.

6269
06:49:23,230 --> 06:49:23,830
Mine now, baby.

6270
06:49:25,170 --> 06:49:26,890
It's for the sake of them.

6271
06:49:29,230 --> 06:49:29,630
Did I?

6272
06:49:29,810 --> 06:49:37,030
I don't know if I mentioned that because I got Netflix for
Breaking Bad.

6273
06:49:37,290 --> 06:49:41,670
I watched K-Pop Demon Hunters today because I was like, I
want to know what the hype is like and everything.

6274
06:49:41,910 --> 06:49:42,750
I thought it was cute.

6275
06:49:43,090 --> 06:49:45,790
I thought they're so cute when they're just like, we do this
for you.

6276
06:49:45,810 --> 06:49:46,950
for the fans.

6277
06:49:47,570 --> 06:49:48,350
That's me right now.

6278
06:49:48,610 --> 06:49:50,030
I'm like, I'm doing this for the villagers.

6279
06:49:52,990 --> 06:49:54,130
I did at the beginning.

6280
06:49:54,530 --> 06:49:54,530
Okay.

6281
06:49:55,930 --> 06:49:59,370
Thanks for sticking around for the whole stream.

6282
06:50:00,970 --> 06:50:02,530
I thought it was pretty cute.

6283
06:50:03,290 --> 06:50:12,790
I mean, there were some parts that I was like, ah, you know,
it was a little cringy, but it's not cringy in like a It was

6284
06:50:12,790 --> 06:50:14,130
your favorite Saja boy.

6285
06:50:15,410 --> 06:50:20,910
I don't I think they all, I don't know, they, I wish they
were like animated different.

6286
06:50:25,470 --> 06:50:26,670
Maybe baby.

6287
06:50:28,170 --> 06:50:28,990
Because it's funny.

6288
06:50:32,780 --> 06:50:39,240
I almost wish they didn't only sing golden because I like
the other song really a lot.

6289
06:50:40,080 --> 06:50:41,640
The little part of me.

6290
06:50:45,300 --> 06:50:48,080
This is what it sounds like.

6291
06:50:48,080 --> 06:50:49,300
I really like that song.

6292
06:50:49,920 --> 06:50:51,340
But I feel like the Huntrix...

6293
06:50:51,340 --> 06:50:51,720
Oh, whoops.

6294
06:50:51,920 --> 06:50:52,320
I thought...

6295
06:50:52,320 --> 06:50:53,140
I was like, what is that?

6296
06:50:53,240 --> 06:50:53,980
Something's in my way.

6297
06:50:54,380 --> 06:50:55,020
I don't need sleep.

6298
06:50:56,040 --> 06:50:57,020
I need a happy Minky.

6299
06:50:57,840 --> 06:50:58,680
No, sleep!

6300
06:50:59,080 --> 06:51:00,140
I'll be happy if you sleep.

6301
06:51:01,860 --> 06:51:05,980
My offensive take is K-pop Demon Hunters is simple here for
normies.

6302
06:51:06,340 --> 06:51:06,680
Oh.

6303
06:51:10,910 --> 06:51:12,650
Oh, oh, oh, no, that's powder!

6304
06:51:12,950 --> 06:51:14,010
That's the powder I stole.

6305
06:51:25,210 --> 06:51:26,550
I like that one better than Golden.

6306
06:51:26,670 --> 06:51:27,030
Yeah!

6307
06:51:27,150 --> 06:51:28,090
I really like it.

6308
06:51:36,530 --> 06:51:37,570
Seek shelter.

6309
06:51:37,910 --> 06:51:38,210
Oh, shoot.

6310
06:51:38,810 --> 06:51:39,250
Uh-oh.

6311
06:51:39,550 --> 06:51:40,490
Uh-oh.

6312
06:51:40,490 --> 06:51:41,130
This is not good.

6313
06:51:43,530 --> 06:51:43,730
Uh-oh.

6314
06:51:43,890 --> 06:51:44,690
Everything is cold.

6315
06:51:45,750 --> 06:51:46,190
Uh-oh.

6316
06:51:49,470 --> 06:51:49,850
Shoot.

6317
06:51:51,770 --> 06:51:53,250
Wait, is this gonna be possible?

6318
06:52:10,790 --> 06:52:12,730
I do have two logs.

6319
06:52:13,470 --> 06:52:14,410
But it seems I'm okay.

6320
06:52:14,430 --> 06:52:14,970
in here?

6321
06:52:16,450 --> 06:52:20,430
If it gets bad, then obviously I'll put them down and...

6322
06:52:22,370 --> 06:52:23,930
Seems like I'm okay in here, though.

6323
06:52:28,720 --> 06:52:29,920
That was a bug, apparently.

6324
06:52:30,160 --> 06:52:30,640
What?

6325
06:52:34,360 --> 06:52:34,840
Okay.

6326
06:52:37,440 --> 06:52:39,220
Alright, now we go do the disc.

6327
06:52:40,540 --> 06:52:41,260
Which I have.

6328
06:52:43,480 --> 06:52:43,960
This.

6329
06:52:49,640 --> 06:52:52,700
Oh, this also was light, but I'm trying to...

6330
06:52:58,380 --> 06:53:00,120
One cold elevator.

6331
06:53:01,040 --> 06:53:01,300
Alright.

6332
06:53:02,660 --> 06:53:03,400
Complete the ritual.

6333
06:53:05,960 --> 06:53:07,520
Do you think I'll bring him back, though?

6334
06:53:09,060 --> 06:53:09,560
Mk?

6335
06:53:10,300 --> 06:53:11,520
Will he be okay?

6336
06:53:12,960 --> 06:53:13,860
He's Mk?

6337
06:53:16,280 --> 06:53:18,160
Just check the world record for this game.

6338
06:53:18,280 --> 06:53:19,960
They're not expected to be sub-10 minutes.

6339
06:53:21,960 --> 06:53:33,040
for for for this ending maybe with the disc you just do a
bunch of jobs and you get the $300 and then you do it wait

6340
06:53:33,040 --> 06:53:37,880
no how do you get across the ice is it glitchless?

6341
06:53:40,260 --> 06:53:46,940
it can't be unless they don't like the true strats of
getting down the mountains

6342
06:53:51,420 --> 06:54:02,440
it's never glitchless I'm not like It's not that I prefer
Glitchless, but you know I think it's always more impressive

6343
06:54:02,440 --> 06:54:12,680
When it's glitchless, obviously Like something about task
runs just don't Interest me I like seeing I don't want to

6344
06:54:12,680 --> 06:54:22,420
see a AI take a person's job Like I just really like
Watching a person do themselves Do it, it's so much, it's so

6345
06:54:22,420 --> 06:54:37,220
interesting some glitches are harder than normal gameplay
that's true i'm that's very true and some things yeah like

6346
06:54:37,220 --> 06:54:45,960
you have to like be pixel perfect in terms of like wall
clipping or something i get that i get that tasas is like

6347
06:54:45,960 --> 06:54:53,320
proof of concept theoretical demista yeah yeah yeah but i
know i know some people that'll like kind of be like oh my

6348
06:54:53,320 --> 06:54:59,040
gosh this we've discovered an even faster bastard run or
something.

6349
06:54:59,340 --> 06:55:01,660
I'm just kind of like, oh, well, you know.

6350
06:55:04,340 --> 06:55:05,600
That's just my personal opinion.

6351
06:55:09,440 --> 06:55:10,040
Choose.

6352
06:55:12,900 --> 06:55:14,440
Howdy, simply wanted to say have a good day.

6353
06:55:14,780 --> 06:55:16,200
You too, Mario.

6354
06:55:17,220 --> 06:55:17,360
Luigi.

6355
06:55:22,060 --> 06:55:23,480
Recovery disk detected.

6356
06:55:24,720 --> 06:55:25,900
SD unit recovery.

6357
06:55:31,470 --> 06:55:32,190
Data okay.

6358
06:55:32,570 --> 06:55:33,310
Repair and restore.

6359
06:55:33,330 --> 06:55:34,310
Restore SD units.

6360
06:55:36,170 --> 06:55:37,130
Restore ending!

6361
06:55:38,210 --> 06:55:38,450
We

6362
06:55:46,150 --> 06:55:47,390
get credits this time.

6363
06:55:55,050 --> 06:55:55,790
Sam, see?

6364
06:55:56,670 --> 06:55:57,290
Is that it?

6365
06:56:07,200 --> 06:56:09,360
So yeah, I just turned everything back to normal?

6366
06:56:14,350 --> 06:56:17,070
Glitched and glitchless are both really impressive in
totally different ways.

6367
06:56:17,230 --> 06:56:18,550
No, they'll get me wrong, I agree.

6368
06:56:20,270 --> 06:56:23,950
I just prefer watching glitchless runs than glitched ones.

6369
06:56:27,230 --> 06:56:28,310
My opinion.

6370
06:56:32,800 --> 06:56:34,180
There's a smidge more after the credits.

6371
06:56:34,320 --> 06:56:34,860
Okay, cool.

6372
06:56:35,900 --> 06:56:39,160
Oh my gosh, the slim, slim team of people.

6373
06:56:39,540 --> 06:56:40,220
Holy cow.

6374
06:56:43,820 --> 06:56:45,180
Cat friends.

6375
06:56:50,550 --> 06:56:54,450
There's more people for localization than anything else.

6376
06:57:01,840 --> 06:57:06,620
Yeah, there's an outline by the truck of like a cat.

6377
06:57:08,240 --> 06:57:08,920
Okay.

6378
06:57:19,070 --> 06:57:20,650
Turn up the music.

6379
06:57:21,850 --> 06:57:24,790
Same amount of people you'd see on a AAA type of game in the
90s.

6380
06:57:27,070 --> 06:57:28,350
Is it Seb?

6381
06:57:28,850 --> 06:57:30,170
Thank you for playing.

6382
06:57:30,970 --> 06:57:32,490
Let's see what happens after credits.

6383
06:57:51,640 --> 06:57:52,460
Nothing happened!

6384
06:57:55,080 --> 06:57:56,620
Did I get one guide?

6385
06:58:10,490 --> 06:58:12,250
Wait, the sun is down though.

6386
06:58:12,290 --> 06:58:12,910
That's kind of funny.

6387
06:58:12,930 --> 06:58:19,090
like it really does save before the factory or after the
factory

6388
06:58:26,840 --> 06:58:34,800
there's nothing here anymore MK is not even here would he be
at his house you think?

6389
06:58:50,140 --> 06:59:01,200
yo here's a million dollar idea individually wrapped cookies
that have ambiguous notes inside I'll call them fate cookies

6390
06:59:01,200 --> 06:59:04,000
sounds similar to something that already exists?

6391
06:59:04,880 --> 06:59:05,800
I don't think so.

6392
06:59:06,780 --> 06:59:07,760
Oh, he's back to normal.

6393
06:59:14,270 --> 06:59:15,170
Are these the...

6394
06:59:15,890 --> 06:59:18,630
These are the guys, the town's folk we wanted to save.

6395
06:59:21,890 --> 06:59:22,690
I see.

6396
06:59:27,660 --> 06:59:28,060
Oops.

6397
06:59:31,850 --> 06:59:32,950
No, no, he has a point.

6398
06:59:34,610 --> 06:59:35,410
Fate cookies.

6399
06:59:36,970 --> 06:59:45,070
Honestly, though, sometimes they should just be called like
mild advice cookies they're not quite fortune they are

6400
06:59:45,070 --> 06:59:48,630
they're very like you should

6401
06:59:51,830 --> 06:59:54,150
you should um

6402
06:59:57,330 --> 07:00:06,830
promise mascot agency oh wait i've heard of that one i think
if you like this one thank you so much for the super chat

6403
07:00:06,830 --> 07:00:18,930
thank you um i've seen ads yeah there's sometimes ads on
them it's so i i don't use this word very lightly it's so

6404
07:00:18,930 --> 07:00:29,230
cringe like it's so oh it's like oh my gosh you can't even i
can't even open a dang cookie without seeing an ad for

6405
07:00:29,230 --> 07:00:33,050
something it's so bad this is like actually just cringe

6406
07:00:40,010 --> 07:00:43,510
It's like, yeah, like, it's actually an ick.

6407
07:00:45,110 --> 07:00:48,430
It'll be forever, remember, once a liar, always a liar, in a
cookie.

6408
07:00:49,170 --> 07:00:50,770
Who was I being warned about?

6409
07:00:51,050 --> 07:00:52,030
Oh my gosh.

6410
07:00:53,110 --> 07:00:55,810
That's like saying once a cheater, always a cheater.

6411
07:00:56,030 --> 07:00:59,070
Hold on, sorry, I gotta fix my contact.

6412
07:00:59,370 --> 07:01:04,450
Oh, we made a little bit of, we caused a little bit of
chaos, but it's okay.

6413
07:01:04,750 --> 07:01:06,090
My contact has been fixed.

6414
07:01:07,730 --> 07:01:08,930
Add block on the cookie.

6415
07:01:08,950 --> 07:01:13,530
Wait, so original spot was like up here.

6416
07:01:14,830 --> 07:01:16,950
Let's see if he's here or if...

6417
07:01:19,710 --> 07:01:19,910
Oh!

6418
07:01:21,530 --> 07:01:22,870
Nailed it.

6419
07:01:23,050 --> 07:01:23,250
Okay.

6420
07:01:25,730 --> 07:01:26,990
Made Mintour's contacts?

6421
07:01:27,710 --> 07:01:28,590
Yes, I do!

6422
07:01:30,290 --> 07:01:30,730
Okay.

6423
07:01:32,030 --> 07:01:34,090
We go to house.

6424
07:01:43,000 --> 07:01:45,380
We go to MK Cabin.

6425
07:01:55,740 --> 07:01:57,240
Wait, oh, here.

6426
07:01:58,860 --> 07:02:01,940
In real life, cookies give you ads, but on the internet, ads
give you cookies.

6427
07:02:02,540 --> 07:02:03,240
Makes you think.

6428
07:02:04,520 --> 07:02:08,400
Why in, out the oven, if, of the oven in?

6429
07:02:11,100 --> 07:02:11,580
Okay.

6430
07:02:15,680 --> 07:02:17,820
You, you restored the shopkeepers.

6431
07:02:18,520 --> 07:02:20,040
I didn't know it was even possible.

6432
07:02:21,440 --> 07:02:23,400
If I'd known I...

6433
07:02:24,160 --> 07:02:26,560
how much this means to me, my wonderful friend.

6434
07:02:27,020 --> 07:02:29,580
Thank you.

6435
07:02:29,800 --> 07:02:30,940
A thousand times.

6436
07:02:31,300 --> 07:02:31,840
Thank you.

6437
07:02:35,720 --> 07:02:36,320
I think...

6438
07:02:36,860 --> 07:02:39,740
I think this means there's a chance I can find Seb again.

6439
07:02:45,120 --> 07:02:46,500
I'm leaving right now.

6440
07:02:46,860 --> 07:02:50,080
Even if it's just a small chance, I have to see if EasyCoal
made a backup.

6441
07:02:50,320 --> 07:02:50,700
I'm going to

6442
07:02:54,160 --> 07:02:57,040
confident, I'm leaving our friends in great hands with you
around.

6443
07:02:58,760 --> 07:03:00,440
You've done a beautiful thing.

6444
07:03:08,830 --> 07:03:10,790
Repair the ST units and tell him, okay.

6445
07:03:14,410 --> 07:03:15,850
Oh, I didn't do that.

6446
07:03:15,970 --> 07:03:17,050
I didn't do a fresh moron.

6447
07:03:18,290 --> 07:03:18,630
Oh!

6448
07:03:25,340 --> 07:03:27,380
He's gonna go find Seb!

6449
07:03:29,080 --> 07:03:29,600
Yippee!

6450
07:03:48,450 --> 07:03:48,970
Yay!

6451
07:03:52,410 --> 07:03:54,550
Now you don't Look at the fishing ending.

6452
07:03:54,970 --> 07:03:55,590
It's okay.

6453
07:03:57,630 --> 07:03:57,930
Yay.

6454
07:03:59,050 --> 07:04:01,910
I was the one in the May Cafe with my buddy on FaceTime.

6455
07:04:02,050 --> 07:04:02,210
Yeah!

6456
07:04:05,710 --> 07:04:07,590
Thanks for being his first meet and greet.

6457
07:04:07,810 --> 07:04:08,370
Thank you!

6458
07:04:08,910 --> 07:04:11,530
Thank you for being such an awesome friend.

6459
07:04:12,770 --> 07:04:14,390
I had so much fun with this game.

6460
07:04:14,510 --> 07:04:18,110
Thank you guys for joining me for easy delivery code.

6461
07:04:18,850 --> 07:04:19,910
Another one for the list?

6462
07:04:24,460 --> 07:04:24,900
Damn.

6463
07:04:27,120 --> 07:04:27,980
There we go!

6464
07:04:29,600 --> 07:04:33,580
You know that to you, you're just you, but to us, you're
beautiful, amazing, and irreplaceable.

6465
07:04:33,740 --> 07:04:35,540
You always make our lives brighter and more fun.

6466
07:04:37,080 --> 07:04:38,940
And we love you!

6467
07:04:39,780 --> 07:04:42,420
We're always here to burn those brainworms as much as you
need.

6468
07:04:42,480 --> 07:04:43,700
Thank you for the stream.

6469
07:04:57,280 --> 07:04:59,220
Oh, I'm sorry, I actually clicked out.

6470
07:04:59,760 --> 07:04:59,900
Oh.

6471
07:05:01,140 --> 07:05:01,780
Thank you!

6472
07:05:09,810 --> 07:05:10,430
Thank you.

6473
07:05:16,290 --> 07:05:18,430
Tri-Princess, thank you so much.

6474
07:05:19,110 --> 07:05:19,830
Thank you, guys.

6475
07:05:19,970 --> 07:05:21,670
I really, really appreciate it.

6476
07:05:24,090 --> 07:05:28,790
Yeah, I had a lot of fun with this game, so I'm going to go
get some breasts, and I suggest you do as well.

6477
07:05:29,850 --> 07:05:30,250
How long?

6478
07:05:30,390 --> 07:05:31,610
It's been seven hours.

6479
07:05:33,490 --> 07:05:36,830
So, it's been a while, though, since I've done a longer
stream like this.

6480
07:05:37,050 --> 07:05:38,910
It didn't even feel like it, I feel...

6481
07:05:38,910 --> 07:05:42,010
There was a bit of a slog in the middle, I would admit, but
yeah.

6482
07:05:42,590 --> 07:05:44,970
And I recommend an anime that's going to come out next year.

6483
07:05:45,050 --> 07:05:45,910
It's called Kaiju Girl.

6484
07:05:47,210 --> 07:05:48,770
Kaiju Girl caramelized.

6485
07:05:48,870 --> 07:05:49,570
It's really cute and wholesome.

6486
07:05:49,750 --> 07:05:50,610
Original Shoujo manga.

6487
07:05:52,490 --> 07:05:53,370
Kaiju Girl.

6488
07:05:55,990 --> 07:05:58,270
Are you going to hit 15 in 2025?

6489
07:05:58,610 --> 07:05:59,270
I will.

6490
07:06:00,930 --> 07:06:02,610
I'm on track for it, baby.

6491
07:06:03,630 --> 07:06:04,070
Yeah.

6492
07:06:05,290 --> 07:06:07,030
But yeah, thank you, guys.

6493
07:06:07,050 --> 07:06:07,410
Nice!

6494
07:06:07,650 --> 07:06:08,390
Thank you, thank you!

6495
07:06:09,130 --> 07:06:11,430
And I hope you had fun too, I hope you...

6496
07:06:11,430 --> 07:06:13,470
I hope it was at least a...

6497
07:06:13,470 --> 07:06:14,570
Wait, where's the music at?

6498
07:06:14,630 --> 07:06:15,010
Come on.

6499
07:06:15,410 --> 07:06:15,870
There we go.

6500
07:06:17,250 --> 07:06:19,050
I hope it was chill, if anything, so...

6501
07:06:21,950 --> 07:06:24,470
Um, but yeah, I had a lot of fun, so...

6502
07:06:24,470 --> 07:06:26,490
Thank you, everybody!

6503
07:06:27,270 --> 07:06:28,250
Osaparo, thank you!

6504
07:06:28,350 --> 07:06:28,810
Thank you!

6505
07:06:28,810 --> 07:06:29,110
Thank you!

6506
07:06:30,310 --> 07:06:31,990
Have you heard of the anime Zombie Land Song?

6507
07:06:32,050 --> 07:06:33,910
Yeah, I love Zombie Land Song, though.

6508
07:06:34,610 --> 07:06:35,630
Thank you for the super chat!

6509
07:06:36,050 --> 07:06:36,570
Thank you, thank you!

6510
07:06:37,150 --> 07:06:39,790
What's up it, what's up it, what's up it, what's up it,
you'll get some rest!

6511
07:06:43,490 --> 07:06:47,650
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
bye bye bye bye bye
