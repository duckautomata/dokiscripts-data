Oh my god.

7
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,380
Am I dead?

8
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,200
God.

9
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,960
Oh god, what do ghosts even do?

10
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,900
Do I say boo?

11
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,240
Do I say bleh?

12
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,400
Oh god.

13
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,900
What's this?

14
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,200
Get a job.

15
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
Excuse me?

17
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,200
Oh my god.

18
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,540
The audacity.

19
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,540
a moment to...

20
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,920
Oh my gosh!

21
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,580
Game!

22
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,500
I think I better get out of this weird forest.

23
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,980
I don't know why I am here.

24
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:42,200
But, um, I think the computer just set on fire, so, uh,
let's just find the nearest town and, uh, set up shop.

25
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,120
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, listen, listen, listen,
everybody, everybody, everybody!

26
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,760
I think I've got it.

27
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,100
I think I finally nailed it.

28
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,320
I think I finally have the sound!

29
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
You have to listen, okay?

30
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,160
Everybody, everybody gather!

31
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,360
Everybody gather and listen, please!

32
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,820
Okay, okay, okay, here I go!

33
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,310
She's really good!

34
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,370
No, no!

35
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,230
It's all wrong!

36
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,770
I just can't get this sound right!

37
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,810
What's wrong with me?

38
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,010
Sorry, guys.

39
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,910
I don't know, recently it just feels like...

40
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,140
It just feels like...

41
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,830
It just feels like I haven't really...

42
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,770
Found my place yet, you know.

43
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,790
Don't really know where I belong.

44
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,250
I guess that's kind of the problem with being a ghost, huh?

45
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,830
It's just, I think it would be a lot of fun if I could find
some friends to create music with, you know?

46
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,830
I feel the May Cafe would be pretty lively then.

47
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,750
I don't know.

48
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,750
Maybe I'm just feeling some ghostly blues, you know?

49
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,670
The booze!

50
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,310
But I know of you guys are here with me, too.

51
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,290
It'll still be a really fun time, so...

52
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:07,990
Thank you.

53
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,970
Let's take it from the top again!

54
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,610
Hey!

55
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,010
Hey!

56
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,550
Oh!

57
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,490
Oh yeah.

58
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,310
Oh yeah.

59
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,310
Break it down.

60
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,270
Break it down.

61
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,860
Um, yeah.

62
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,280
He's still there.

63
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,260
Staring at me.

64
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,620
Menacingly.

65
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,880
With like...

66
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
Look at that smile.

67
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,180
I don't know.

68
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,660
Guys.

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
What am I supposed to do?

70
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,280
Talk to him?

71
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,020
Like we haven't had...

72
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,720
This is...

73
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,260
It's literal flesh.

74
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,780
When has an actual human been in this mid-cafe?

75
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,960
I don't know.

76
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,580
I don't...

77
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,680
I don't...

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,780
What am I supposed to say?

79
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,060
Do I...

80
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,100
Do I possess him?

81
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,080
Do I...

82
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,940
Do I say boo?

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,760
Will he get scared?

84
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,400
Will he leave?

85
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,920
I don't know!

86
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,520
Okay.

87
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll be brave.

88
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,100
I'll be brave.

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Okaidinaasai masai gochidin sama, ojo sama?

90
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,780
Are you lost?

91
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,990
They're still there.

92
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,110
Oh, we don't get many customers.

93
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,070
I mean, we get customers.

94
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,930
We don't get many.

95
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,790
Fleshy.

96
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,290
What do I do?

97
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,780
My name is Min Phantom.

98
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,120

99
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,300

106
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,160
Conversation starter.

107
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,540
The weather.

108
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,500
Happening.

Oh, so are you hungry?

112
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,680
Did you happen to think that this was a maid cafe, which it
definitely is.

113
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,940
This is a maid cafe.

114
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,980
Did you think this was a maid cafe and you came to
experience maid and food?

115
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:50,920
Surely?

116
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,020

128
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,580
Prime sounds like a good thing.

129
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,960
Like, it's prime.

130
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,000
It's peak.

131
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,120

132
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,720
It's, yeah.

133
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,760
October 1st, which has already passed, which...

134
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
Um, yeah.

135
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,180
Uh...

136
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:42,680
very tall 149 centimeters yeah that's this is all the mint
phantom everybody yeah this is

137
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:55,720
very tall no yes also don't ask about my weight why would
you do that why would you do that why would you do that

138
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,420
let's look at let's look at oh here i'm gonna zoom in a
little bit more We'll look at one at a time, right?

139
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,480
You guys have short attention spans, maybe.

140
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:08,940
Yeah.

141
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,220
And then, you know, I have all of these already.

142
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,400
These are.

143
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,040
In fact, I feel I have seen a few people, maybe one or two,
that have done the ghost and the sparkle together.

144
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,480
Where's my subway surfers?

145
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,680
You could literally get your phone.

146
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:41,980
out at any time but it's very rude I'm talking to you no way
yes way yes way so if you're looking for something a little

147
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:52,640
more for a cultured palette I would recommend the hashtag
fantography for good for delicious art but I think sometimes

148
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,980
people put things in there that might should go in another
hashtag

149
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,240
It's a little scary in there, even for me sometimes.

150
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,920
And, of course, for the live stream, that's chef's choice.

151
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,520
Me, I'm the chef.

152
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,520
So, actually, you guys, we might be doing away with the
Japanese hashtag on Mito Live.

153
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,780
And just sticking with hashtag Mito Live.

154
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,020
Just for consistency.

155
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,520
I do check both quite often, but I think we'll just keep it
in the one.

156
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,400
What do you mean, doe?

157
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
It's okay, it's okay.

158
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,080
Next, we have...

159
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,020
I have a plushie.

160
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,160
And if you have that plushie, I would like you to use
hashtag mint to go.

161
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,280
Get it?

162
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,660
It's like mint to go, but mint to go.

163
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,160
It's a pun.

164
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,040
But that thing is a very dangerous creature.

165
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,120
And, you know.

166
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,480
And also for general, we're keeping mint to shinde, shashin,
but you can also use hashtag mint phantom that is fine as

167
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,280
well and then you must be 18 years or age of oh wait wait 18

You are not ready for it unless you've literally done every
single thing that I told you to do in the mountains.

likes of being silly.

252
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,360
Oh, my gosh.

253
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,760
Oh, being a silly otaku.

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,740
And cute girls and things.

255
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,640

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,940
Idols and being a otaku.

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,720
Oh, yeah.

260
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480

261
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,340
Corn soup.

262
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Who wouldn't love corn soup?

263
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,520
Dad jokes.

264
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,320
I do love a good joke.

265
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,020
Yeah.

266
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,080
And E, E, E.

267
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,640
Hmm.

268
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,000
See, I've always heard that people don't like, you know,
that feeling when you're like, E!

269
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,160
But liking E, E.

270
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,820
I get it.

271
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,600
I get it.

272
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,660
Hmm.

273
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,980
I think I understand.

274
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,740
But usually I hear people don't like E.

275
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,240
But I think I like E.

276
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,280
You know?

277
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,280
What's wrong with E?

278
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,960
E.

279
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,420
Ah.

280
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Of course, these things are all so relatable, no?

281
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,760
I think I love every single one of these things.

282
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,200
But actually, isn't that so silly?

283
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,980
Hmm, interesting.

284
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:34,060
Let's get this, let's also, isn't this spider just so cute,
but like, they made a total mess of my, of my, um, my table.

285
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,400
I don't, actually, this is not even mine.

286
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,240
I don't know where this came from, so.

287
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,980
Oh, oh no, dislike, sad.

288
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,940
Spicy food?

289
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,600
Yeah, actually I can't have spicy food either.

290
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,680
You know?

291
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,760
Messes?

292
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,960
Well, I'm a maid, so of course I hate messes and everything.

293
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,040
The jumpy kind.

294
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,060
Okay.

295
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,200
I have like so much...

296
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,180
Okay, like even ladybugs, you know?

297
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,680
I don't even like ladybugs because they jump at me.

298
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,340
Is that weird?

299
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,760
I like them from far away, but I don't like when...

300
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,580
I don't like bugs that go...

301
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,360
You know what I mean?

302
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh, hide berries.

303
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,060
Oh, oh,

304
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,970
you're not watching this, are you?

305
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,770
Whoa.

306
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,750
Anyway, um, wearing socks in bed.

307
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,270
Okay, I don't care how cold my feet are.

308
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,350
I don't care.

309
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,190
I don't care how cold my feet are.

310
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,890
I have to not wear socks in bed.

311
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,890
It's like the most uncomfortable feeling for me.

312
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,210
Like I'm always, I will take off my socks.

313
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:56,110
I'll be in bed and if I accidentally wear my socks, I'm
like, Phoebe!

314
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,390
Grippers out always.

315
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,690
I gotta feel free.

316
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,890
Like, I don't know.

317
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,390
I wear socks all day.

318
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,410
So I really love the feeling of taking off my socks in my
bed.

319
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,590
You know?

320
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,490
I don't know.

321
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,030
That's just how it is.

322
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:18,470
And then, when you don't bring offerings to me, of course,
as a ghost, I need offerings.

323
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,290
I need sustenance to continue my ghostly, not life.

324
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:36,230
live it life so bring me snacks please and thank you okay
what else we got here let's get my my very my thin books out

325
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,730
of the way oh and

326
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:55,260
oh i i i feel like these have not changed so much in in
years i feel like i still love the same things even after

327
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:01,080
all these years I even, like, kind of tried to make it a
little smaller, you know?

328
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,760
So I love Steinsuke!

329
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,900
Did you guys see some of the Steinsuke references in the new
opening?

330
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,800
And I love YuroKamp!

331
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,680
I love Yoruboy!

332
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,520
It plays further than the universe.

333
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,400
That's one.

334
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,440
I went to Antarctica because of that series.

335
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,120
I love...

336
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,020
I love...

337
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,940
I love...

338
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,460
Re-zero.

339
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:39,040
Okay, but Whatever Slop is fine sometimes I love Slop I love
idle stuff like wug and iMass And iCarts I love a bunny girl

340
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:49,440
senpai And I love a When They Cry series So I was a fan of
Sotsu and Go When they came out Very happy Especially

341
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,580
because Akio Watanabe Did the character design for that And
so it was like Everything that I love All coming together

342
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,080
Gather!

343
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,480
So, hmm, I feel like these haven't changed at all.

345
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,120
I think the only thing that's really changed about me is the
games that I like.

346
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,400
It's funny.

347
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,280
I mean, I like what I like, so it's okay to enjoy slop.

348
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,300
I agree.

349
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,320
Everybody has a guilty pleasure.

350
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,520
You all are not innocent.

351
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,200
We're in this together.

352
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,060
And I know that because you're here.

353
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,300
Don't think you're better than me.

354
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,660
Don't act like you're better than me.

355
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,980
And last but not least, we have...

356
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,600
Let me move this cardboard box out of the way.

357
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,660
Oh, that's you.

358
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,500
Sorry.

359
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,620
Bye,

360
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,340
Ben.

361
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,760
Don't do this.

362
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,500
Don't leave.

363
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,080
I talked about Re-Zero once and you're already trying to
skidaddle out of here.

364
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:03,960
Games!

365
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,840
Who's scribbling all this stuff on the table like this?

366
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,020
Gosh, you guys could never tell, right?

367
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,540
Because of the filter that I keep on the camera.

368
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,220
You would never know that all of this is on here.

369
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,940
We have Metal Gear Solid!

370
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,550
Metal Gear Solid series.

371
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,790
Maybe like a little bit.

372
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,210
Blue Archive!

373
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,790
I just did my dailies literally right before stream.

374
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,930
as I was panicking.

375
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,530
I was like, am I going to remember everything?

376
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,650
Am I going to remember everything?

377
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,350
Yeah, I think we're okay so far.

378
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:46,910
Maybe.

379
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,030
Maybe we're okay.

380
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,070
So far, so far, so good.

381
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,310
Ace Attorney series.

382
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,590
I really love Ace Attorney series.

383
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,990
I love horror games.

384
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,290
And I love puzzle games.

385
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,870
And I love horror and puzzle games.

386
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,610
But I also like them separate.

387
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,650
I love Blue Archive.

388
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,210
Oh my gosh, I'm a huge blue.

389
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,790
I don't even know if you could put that under GIM.

390
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,470
It's a mobile game, it's fine.

391
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,910
I love Toho!

392
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,010
Toho Project.

393
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,510
Konichiwa.

394
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,570
Watashiwa.

395
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:17,730
Mint Phantom.

396
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,490
Watashiwa.

397
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,110
Toho Project.

398
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:21,990
I like this.

399
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,270
Wait, the joke is it's supposed to sound like good Japanese.

400
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,750
And then Toho Project.

401
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:28,870
My bad.

402
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,590
Blue Archive.

403
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,630
And then I like visual novels.

404
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,590
Though I will say.

405
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,430
I like them.

406
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,210
I have not played so many.

407
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:43,450
of late because I am so busy, but I am always open to your
suggestions.

408
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,330
Yes.

409
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,090
I should, I probably, I don't know.

410
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,710
Maybe I'll play when on the plane.

411
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,190
Or something.

412
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,590
So yeah, these are all the things I like.

413
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,270
Oh, I also forgot.

414
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,250
Oh my gosh.

415
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,690
So in the past, I've talked about having my MP3 player.

416
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:18,790
and um i've i've had it for like maybe 10 years now or
something unfortunately when my last car died i stopped

417
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:33,770
using my mp3 player because now with my new car i'm able to
to hook up my um my phone to the car i know but what i have

418
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:40,230
here as you could see is my Isn't it so cute?

419
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,830
Isn't it so cute?

420
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,570
Everybody say, sorry, I'm a little ghostly at the moment.

421
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,610
It's, you know.

422
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:57,390
But, yeah, I thought it would be fun to show some things
that I would, like, listen to while, you know, driving

423
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:57,890
around.

424
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,550
So, let's see.

425
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,630
It's actually in Japanese, not by, because I'm a weeaboo,
which is the truth.

426
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,350
Because it was given to me by some Japanese organizers.

427
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,750
And it does not change to English.

428
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,930
It is only Japanese.

429
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,550
So that was fun.

430
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,490
Let's see what we got.

431
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,670
Okay, let's go to album.

432
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,930
And we'll just kind of go through some songs that I would
listen to while driving.

433
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,130
So let's see.

434
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,990
I've got some AKB48 on here.

435
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:32,570
What I...

436
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:32,990
Oh my gosh.

437
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,790
I like to joke that this is like a graveyard of music.

438
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:48,030
because there's so many idols in here so many groups and
things that just don't exist anymore so like and also what's

439
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:56,710
really cool is I have a bunch of like super indie idol group
that I would like buy their CD and then rip it and just

440
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:04,970
groups that also don't exist anymore but like I have like
this little bit of history because because I own their stuff

441
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:14,770
so it's kind of fun it's like it feels It feels like a very
me type of mp3 player, song choice.

442
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,930
So we have Dampagumi Inc.

443
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,610
Is this the...

444
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,370
Oh, I did click album.

445
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,090
We have Momo I Haruko.

446
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,650
Oh, sorry.

447
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:20,930
Hold on.

448
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,430
I'm trying to...

449
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,790
There we go.

450
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,370
That's better.

451
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:24,810

527
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,830
That's like, that's like kind of, that's like psycho
behavior, no?

528
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,250
That'd be ridiculous!

529
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,330
What are we talking about?

530
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,410
Look how clean it is!

531
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,110
Look how clean.

532
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,530
Do you want...

533
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,290
Do you want the house tour?

534
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,290
I can take you to the first, second, third floor.

535
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,050
Actually, there's only one floor.

536
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,460
My room.

537
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,700
There's only...

538
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,700
There is only one floor, and it's my room.

539
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,740
And, uh...

540
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,560
Why am I so small?

541
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,040
Oh, my gosh!

542
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,600
What are you doing in my room?

543
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,760
You freaks?

544
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,660
Welcome.

545
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,920
Oh, I think chat is frozen.

546
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,600
Give me a second.

547
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,620
I'll revive you.

548
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,240
Oh, you're revived!

549
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,860
Oh.

550
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,700
A girl's room!

551
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,340
A girl's room!

552
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,940
It's a little... It's a little messy.

553
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,080
Just like the table.

554
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,040
But it's okay.

555
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,460
That's fine.

556
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,340
Hi!

557
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,760
Welcome to my room and welcome to my debut!

558
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,180
Thank you, everybody!

559
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:57,020

dislikes and my... my things and my...

So Denzetsu.exe was created and, oh, it is also owned by me,
Phoebe and Vicky.

636
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:12,940
So, the three of us we came up with with essentially
everything like the concept and um and everything that all

of our all of our ideas and everything came together through
our brains um so we're we're a little we're a little some

638
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,500

idol group um we just kind of wanted to have like a creative

639
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:44,680
outlet with like um with like an idle focus kind of kind of
kind of idea and um we do we have all we have full control

on stream.

647
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,140

because because there was one last thing I wanted to do as a

656
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:07,000
maiden let's go Where am I?

657
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:07,740

658
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,350
And...

659
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:17,770
Okay.

660
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,670
One last thing.

661
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,230
One last thing.

662
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:24,490
Wow.

663
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,610
Koshiditsaba, you fell asleep and you had a very strange
dream.

664
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,350
Please, please try not to fall asleep at the table.

665
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:36,650
It's actually very meiwaku for our other patrons.

666
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:38,010
Definitely.

667
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,770
are here.

668
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:43,650
Yeah.

669
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:54,570
Anyway, because we don't get very many customers, many flesh
customers, is it okay if I can say that?

670
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:03,070
I have a little checklist to go over so that I can be a
proper maid.

671
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,310
I don't want to forget anything, you know?

672
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:24,960
so um um oh how'd that get in there just uh uh don't worry
about that worry about my dreams oh as you can see this was

673
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:34,500
updated i literally wrote this list october 9th 2024 i have
a i know that because that's the date that i posted it in

674
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:42,460
discord yeah in my private like i have my own discord like
that nobody else is in just me where i can like write notes

675
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:53,200
i'm sure i feel like a lot of people have that so so some of
these might be a little outdated um let's let's go through

676
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:01,560
and then maybe we can make some new dreams and goals
together if that's okay so first i want to collab with an

677
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:09,800
idol group i want to collab with an idol group maybe like a
Japanese idol group maybe some group that I really really

678
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:20,340
love or something yeah that's been that's been a dream of
mine for a really long time so yeah yeah yeah I want to see

679
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:31,020
Minto cosplay and Dojin at Comic-Camp but I feel like I feel
like I could cross out the Dojin at least the Dojin part

680
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:39,180
because technically Ayami Mama has released a dojinchi of me
at Comic-Cat!

681
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:46,020
Or at least not, well, she released a dojinchi that I am in
at Comic-Cat, so...

682
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,600
Yeah!

683
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,260
Guys, why are you blushing?

684
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,480
Dojinchi is not always so edgy, okay?

685
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:57,960
Yeah.

686
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,520
But...

687
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,520
Well, I'll save this for later.

688
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:10,980
Then, we can cross out concert, cross out, cross out, and do
a 3D concert live!

689
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,600
I've done both!

690
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,300
That's kind of insane!

691
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,900
Oh, oh my gosh.

692
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,060
I can't believe it.

693
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,620
I can't believe it!

694
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,020
I can't believe I've done both.

695
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,580
Yeah!

696
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,380
This one might be kind of out of nowhere.

697
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,600
I want to learn how to DJ.

698
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:37,900
I kind of want to become like an Anikura DJ and DJ at and
like maybe host my own Anikura event one day which is like

699
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:53,680
basically they just play anime songs and people do calls and
are silly and it's fun yeah i'm into ab mogra one day one

700
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:03,120
day maybe i also want to make a haunted house maybe at like
like an event or something like even if it's just kind of i

701
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,200
just want to design it you

702
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:17,220
I want to maybe one day make a haunted house And you guys go
through it And then tell me it's 10 out of 10 super spooky I

703
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:24,660
will make number 2 happen Well, I'll wait for it then Oh

704
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,850
I want to sing an opening song for a visual novel

705
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:42,770
Yep That is one of my goals One of my goals, one of my
dreams.

706
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,370
That's also been a dream for a while.

707
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:55,670
And then I think the last time I met up with Ayami Mama, she
was just like, she was like, Minto, my goal for you is to

708
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,350
reach 1 million subscribers.

709
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:09,110
And I think that if I ever reach 1 million subscribers, then
maybe I could probably ask Ayami Mama to make that kind of

710
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:09,450
doji.

711
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,230
An official.

712
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:14,850
So...

713
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,910
We'll see if it ever happens.

714
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,140
That will be my 1 million subscriber goal.

715
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,540
And I would also like to get to 1 million subscribers one
day because I've never had that many ever before in my

716
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,060
afterlife.

717
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,700
So it would be really cool to see, I think.

718
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:36,500
Yeah!

719
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,080
Yeah.

720
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,080
And then...

721
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:49,620
My last final dream is to possess you and make you happy!

722
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,240
That's a Minto goal for me, Minto.

723
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,460
I wrote that.

724
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,800
Yeah!

725
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,860
So, will you...

726
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,940

Will you let me possess your body and...

728
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:12,430

00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:13,490
Maybe.

730
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,850
