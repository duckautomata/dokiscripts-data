Haunted negative.

55
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:42,830
Negative.

56
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,830
There's no negative.

57
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,510
We're haunting everybody.

58
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,950
In parentheses, negative.

59
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,830
No, never think that.

60
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,330
Haunting is always positive.

61
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,830
Like a bug infestation is always positive.

62
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,990
Exactly, exactly.

63
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,790
Who wouldn't want thousands of little berry bugs?

64
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,030
Like, oh my god, wait.

65
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,450
I don't know.

66
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,010
That sounds disgusting.

67
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,330
To you.

68
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,170
I know, to me, even to me, that sounds disgusting.

69
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:18,210
I can imagine them all at the feet of someone being like,
just all randomly spewing, like, Fujo nonsense.

70
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,910
Yeah, or, like, I'm, like, accidentally rage-baiting.

71
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,130
I still can't.

72
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:31,750
it over and the off collab like ashen being like she was she
said something she was like girl you are testing me this

73
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:39,010
trip yeah yeah i think about it all the time too where she's
like uh i think her exact words were very pleased this

74
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:52,640
weekend you have been testing me my favorite accidental rage
baiter yeah oh my god she she sounded so tired i was like

75
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,920
damn was i really doing all that You're doing too much.

76
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,880
I was doing too much, I guess.

77
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,680
My bad.

78
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,500
My bad.

79
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,620
Yeah, you've been bugging her.

80
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,960
Yeah, I've been bugging her.

81
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,260
That's the thing.

82
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,360
It's just so funny how you say things and you're so wrong.

83
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,300
You're so confident.

84
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,100
You're so wrong.

85
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,100
It's because I just, I just, I vocalize my thoughts.

86
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,920
So even if I think they're wrong, I say it out loud to hear
how it sounds and then to like really make sure.

87
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,840
But because there are people around me, it's like, oh, maybe
I should have said it out loud.

88
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,100
I think that's a good way of learning if you're wrong,
though.

89
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:42,320
How would you know your brain might be like, like if you
think it inside and you're like, this sounds correct, you

90
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,140
know, you might never know if you're wrong.

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,320
Oh, I don't know if you talked about it, but I keep
remembering like, um, at Disney the avatar ride where the

92
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:12,040
one we got turned on on no we don't don't drag me don't drag
me into your freaky world I did not get turned on who was it

93
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,520
that said that people get turned on on the ride it was
Ashton Ashton said it like a second before the ride started

94
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:25,300
just as like a quick by the way so there's this ride
everybody it's this avatar ride that like you sit on the

95
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,280
drag and you ride around on it.

96
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,300
The Banshee.

97
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,040
And like you can feel it breathing and stuff.

98
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,600
And Ashton was like, sometimes people get turned on on this
ride.

99
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,680
And afterwards, I'm a very honest ghost.

100
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,400
I said, yeah, I got turned on.

101
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,220
I mean.

102
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,340
Oh yeah, you said it.

103
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,460
We're all like, huh?

104
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,420
Nobody agreed with me.

105
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,960
Because we were like, we were just shocking.

106
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,760
It was just shocking.

107
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,860
Okay, but I'm like a monster fucker.

108
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,260
I felt like I was on a dragon.

109
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
So what do you want from me?

110
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,640
You can feel it breathing like in between your legs, you
guys.

111
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,180
You can.

112
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,360
It's very like, it's, I imagine that's what it feels like to
like ride a horse in real life.

113
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,260
Wait, don't say that.

114
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,500
Wait, no, that sounds bad.

115
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,140
What do you mean?

116
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,540
That sounds bad to me.

117
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,200
Like, wait.

118
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,920
Like, come on, man.

119
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,240
I read my Keenan was right there.

120
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,300
I don't mean it like that.

121
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,140
I don't mean it.

122
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,520
But people are going to be like, oh, Mint is going to get
turned on riding a horse.

I've taught you like crawl into into the ears and get into
the brain.

220
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,710
Like you get one.

221
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,990
Like plankton.

222
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:08,510
No, you get one story of a ladybug being found in like a
random lady in China's colon.

223
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,390
And now, and now this is what...

224
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:11,710
Wait, that really happened?

225
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,330
Yeah, there's like a picture of it that goes around.

226
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,750
Or that when the story broke, there was a picture of it that
was going around of like this ladybug, just this random

227
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,970
ladybug in the colonoscopy.

228
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,310
Did you know the ladybug?

229
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,740
I can't answer that.

230
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:49,400
I wonder if the ladybug survived I think it did it kind of
seemed alive in the picture not all bugs know each other

231
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:58,280
okay but anytime there's a life is amazing everybody asks if
I know the ghost okay so you're you're inflicting that that

232
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:10,260
kind of prejudice sentence to me I am because I I am hurt
and so I must pain onto others because I too have been hurt.

233
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,380
Oh, okay.

234
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:11,780
Okay.

235
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,200
My bad.

236
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,720
My bad.

237
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,040
It's like trauma.

238
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,680
Yeah, this is generational.

239
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,720
This is what happens.

240
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,880
We will stop the cycle.

241
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,860
You gotta stop the cycle of violence.

242
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,160
That's what Mariko said.

243
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,860
What an inspiration that guy is.

244
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:49,780
Hurt people hurt people it's true it's true it's true it's
true that's my ninja way yeah i will say i i really do love

people are like, I'm no bro of yours.

252
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,520
It's like, well, okay, what am I going to do then?

253
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,700

254
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,260
Right.

255
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,760

Maybe, maybe.

259
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,780
I think if they want to, if they even consider themselves a
bug bro, they would be like, yeah, you're my bro.

260
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,060

around it's cute it is cute hmm yeah I will say The top

285
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:42,070
moment, though, this year was definitely the fact that we,
when we were lining up for Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic

286
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:50,730
Rewind, the ride, like all throughout the line, like the
one-hour wait, we were like, oh, I hope we get September.

287
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,990
I hope we get September.

288
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,690
I hope we get September.

289
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,090
And then when we wrote it, we actually got September.

290
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:07,150
I can't even express like when it shot us backwards and it
was just like, it and I was like I literally don't remember

291
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,970
what even happened on the ride.

292
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,710
I was just jamming out to September so hard.

293
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,530
Me too.

294
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,390
Like they were talking during the ride and I'm just like
party.

295
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:17,230
Yeah.

296
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,350
Like I was literally hands up in the air like jamming.

297
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,090
It was so fun.

298
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,490
We were like all dancing.

299
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,410
Yeah it was so fun.

300
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,390
It was so good.

301
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,590
It was so good.

302
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:34,210
It was really funny though after the ride ashton being like
wasn't that the best ride ever and then later she was like

303
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:43,470
wasn't that the best ride ever and everyone was like yeah it
was pretty good and she was like upset that nobody like she

304
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,990
told me later she was like why didn't everyone agree with me

305
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:03,670
this but cosmic rewind was so good too i love ashing because
she was really just like the the soul type a and a group of

306
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:13,850
type b's oh my god she was hardcore like it was so good
though it was so good though honestly like when we before we

307
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:21,010
went we thought ashton's plan was going to be like okay down
to the minute down to the millisecond like you have time to

308
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:26,890
eat this little snack here and then yeah straight to this
ride and then straight to this ride but now it ended up

309
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:35,310
being like you know more like maybe yeah maybe maybe that's
just because like we're we were all like theme park like

310
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,010
fans.

311
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,510
So like we were all like locked in.

312
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,730
We were like, yeah, we need to ride this ride like right
now.

313
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,790
We can eat later.

314
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:50,290
Like the way that when Animal Kingdom opened and we like, we
were like crazy beeline.

316
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,090
We were like speedwalking like crazy.

317
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,250
We weren't running because you're not allowed to run, but we
were definitely like power walking.

318
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,290
We were power walking to Avatar Ride.

319
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,370
It was crazy.

320
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,790
And then like Ashton would look behind and be like, oh, you
guys are still behind me.

321

Sorry, guys.

366
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:08,780
Oops.

Whoa!

371
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,820

372
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,740
What the heck?

373
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,440
Oh, wait, hold on.

374
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,220

375
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,960
Where am I...

376
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,640
Wait, wait, did you... Did you make me go back in?

377
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,140
Oh, my bad.

378
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,520
What the... What the heck?

379
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,480
How did I do that?

380
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,300
Alright.

381
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:33,740
You did?

382
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,440
Ah!

383
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:46,490
anyways we're gonna finish this game this is the 49th game
on minto's list it is it is i'm trying to yeah 50 games this

384
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:56,710
year everybody yeah 50 she's on her way yeah you you knocked
out croak i i gotta i gotta watch the vod but i did not i

385
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:03,030
really did not expect you you to when you were like do you
have any game recommendations like shorter games i was like

386
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,670
yeah croak country is like pretty short But that took me
like three streams to do.

387
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,450
Three streams.

388
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,250
Yeah, so I was like, I was like, okay, so it's like, it's on
the shorter side.

389
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,010
It's not like DMC or Metal Gear, right?

390
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,430
Right.

391
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:17,990
But...

392
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,890
I really did not expect you to finish it all in one stream.

393
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,410
What the heck?

394
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,450
It was only seven hours.

395
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,030
I feel like that's a...

396
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,770
Like it's a longer stream, obviously, but it's like
definitely doable for...

397
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,810
No, but you like really locked in, I guess.

398
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,310
I got a...

399
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,210
Did you like it?

400
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,430
I really like the story.

401
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,230
I actually really liked it.

402
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,290
Yeah, right.

403
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,650
The story is like, oh.

404
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,270
Yeah.

405
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,710
And it was very forgiving for, like, survival.

406
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,350
I, like, got a comment of someone being, like, oh, it was
kind of, it was, you know, it was fun to watch Minto play

407
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,770
it, but at the same time, like, her, because I would hoard
bullets, like, I didn't want to use, I didn't want to shoot

408
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,470
very much.

409
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:03,110
But, like, it's because I'm so traumatized by other games
that they give you, like, two bullets every two hours.

410
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,390
So I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

411
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,450
That's why I had faith.

412
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,670
We're both gamers.

413
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,110
I just ran everywhere.

414
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,890
Whoa, hey.

415
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,010
Hey.

416
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,630
Don't touch me.

417
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,550
Don't touch me.

418
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,690
Don't touch me.

419
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,630
Don't touch me.

420
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,510
Don't touch me.

421
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,290
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

422
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,290
All right.

423
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,710
7-4.

424
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,110
Wait, how many more do we have here?

425
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,930
I think it's literally just this, I think.

426
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,830
And then upstairs?

427
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:41,090
Yeah, upstairs and then this might be the end like this this
legitimately might be an hour stream no well maybe oh yeah

428
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:55,510

Oh, gosh.

433
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,850
No, you have to throw me.

434
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:35,310
Remember, it's like a...

435
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,770
Oh, you didn't even give me warning!

436
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,600

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:21,670
What's it called?

506
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:22,930
How you get it?

507
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,870
Yeah, hold on.

508
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,410
I'm going to try.

509
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,970
Okay.

510
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,190
Oh, wait.

511
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,210
You see it?

512
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,830
You see it?

513
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,070
I see what you're putting down.

514
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:30,470
Yeah.

515
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,770
Oh, okay.

516
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,530
You're so smart.

517
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,010
I did it!

518
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,030
Yeah!

519
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:35,890
Wait, sorry.

520
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,570
I blocked you?

521
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,310
Okay.

522
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:38,930
All right.

523
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,530
How do I use this thing again?

524
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,490
You just go.

525
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,150
Oh.

526
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,710
Oh, shoot.

527
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

528
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,490
So close.

529
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,450
Oh, you killed him.

530
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:47,970
You killed him.

531
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,310
I did?

532
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:49,470
Yeah.

533
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,490
Whoa, where am I?

534
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,510
Ah, I was so close.

535
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,110
Where are you?

536
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,410
I don't know.

537
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,730
Why are you all the way up there?

538
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,230
How did this happen?

539
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,090
I'll put this, I'll put this there, though.

540
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,550
Oh, that's, oh, yippee.

541
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:05,810
Yay, yippee.

542
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,370
Get off.

543
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,210
Sorry.

544
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:09,730
I'm here.

545
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:11,890
Um...

546
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,210
No, no, no!

547
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,110
You can say help!

548
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,610
How'd you do that?

549
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,870
It's like one of the trigger buttons.

550
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,730
Oh, that's not it.

551
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,670
That's not it.

552
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,150
There you go.

553
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:30,890
Help!

554
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,010
No, no, no, no!

555
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,250
No, no, no, no!

556
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,970
You guys, what if I just...

557
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,270
No!

558
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,750
What do we do here, Barry?

559
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,090
You just go back down.

560
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:50,610
Oh, we do?

561
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,670
We go back down, silly.

562
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,650
And then we go...

563
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,390
We go...

564
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,010
Uh...

565
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,970
Down here, probably?

566
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,590
Oh, we didn't go this way?

567
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,390
Oh, you're right.

568
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,070
Yeah, I don't think so.

569
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:02,970
Okay.

570
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:03,790
Oh!

571
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,350
You got this?

572
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,570
Oh.

573
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,470
You got this?

574
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:10,850
Oh!

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,950
Oh!

00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,690
Oh!

577
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,310

578
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,450

Okay, I'm gonna die.

Alright, yeah, die?

Okay.

No, please.

I can't!

622
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,640
I can't make it.

623
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:56,960
Wait.

624
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,080
Ah!

625
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,680
Now, why would you go and do that?

626
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,620
You know, hold on.

627
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,700
Come back, come back down here, and I'll throw you up.

628
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:06,840
Okay, okay.

But how do you...

630
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,240
This way.

631
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,340
There you go.

632
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,620
Okay, but how do you...

633
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,460
Okay, maybe...

634
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,480
I think you just got...

635
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,220
Grab my hand.

636
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,020
Ah, okay.

637
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:19,780
All right.

638
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:20,860
Oh, wait.

639
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,880
Grab my hand.

640
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,340
Do a handshake event.

641
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,400
Do a handshake event.

642
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,280
Grab my hand.

643
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,700
Grab my disgusting hand.

644
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,840
Okay, okay.

645
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,440
I'm sorry.

646
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,940
I'm wearing the hazmat suit.

647
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,300
All right.

648
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:33,900
All right.

649
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,420
You throw me up.

650
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,340
Okay, I'll throw you up.

651
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,480
Oh, just kidding.

652
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,280
Oh, does that work?

653
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,060
I don't know.

654
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,980
I think I don't, I think so.

655
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,760
Wait, can you jump?

656
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,020
You're so- wait, if I jump?

657
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,600
There you go.

658
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,220
There you go.

659
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,600
There you go.

660
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:49,880
There you go.

661
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:50,580
Ah!

662
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:51,840
Oh!

663
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:52,880
Wait, you're fine!

664
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:53,980
You're fine!

665
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,160
I don't know if I can...

666
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,320
I don't think I can.

667
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,620
Oh, you know what?

668
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,700
You probably have to bring the movable thing down here to-
to like platform.

669
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,140
You know what I mean?

670
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,300
Or I go up there.

671
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:15,660
There you go.

673
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,160
All right, watch this.

674
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,380
Wow, truly a master.

675
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh, what were you saying?

676
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:27,880
What were you saying?

677
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,140
I wasn't...

678
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,280
All right, watch this.

679
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,600
Oh!

680
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,820
Oh yeah, now it's...

681
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,340
Now the table switch.

682
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,040
There you go, see?

683
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,020
That's how you do it.

684
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,380
I'm gonna curl myself.

685
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,400
Okay, here we go.

686
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,800
You just gotta, you gotta, you gotta kick.

687
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,160
Why does that keep getting?

688
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,960
Oh, whatever.

689
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,280
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore.

690
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,240
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

691
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,260
We made it.

692
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,980
Okay, now what?

693
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,900
Oh, oh, oh.

694
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,860
Oh, here we go.

695
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,260
Here we go.

696
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,220
Did we get everything?

697
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,920
I think so.

698
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,180
Yeah.

699
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,600
Oh, let me in.

700
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,540
Oh.

701
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,600
.

702
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:09,620
.

703
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,500
.

704
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,140
Clear.

705
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,120
Guys, what was the time on that?

706
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,800
Don't worry about it.

707
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,140
Don't worry about it.

708
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,460
We got an A.

709
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,080
We got an A.

710
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,800
It's true.

711
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,520
All right.

712
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,060
X2 seen 2.

713
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,940
The exit's right here.

714
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,100
Okay, I'm going down.

715
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,240
We gotta collect gems.

716
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,160
Oh, wait.

717
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:33,660
How do you...

718
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:33,840
Oh.

719
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:34,560
Oh.

720
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,220
Oh.

721
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:35,600
Oh.

722
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,340
Oh.

723
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,460
How do you hold on?

724
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,620
Oh, I think it's a trigger, right?

725
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,980
Yeah, it's a trigger.

726
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,580
Okay.

727
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,160
Yeah, that happened to me too.

728
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,460
Oh, I did not pay attention.

729
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,080
Look at me.

730
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,400
I'm...

731
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,040
Spider-Man.

732
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,660
Oh my god, you're literally...

733
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm on your butt.

734
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,220
Yeah, you're on my booty.

735
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:54,720
Oh!

736
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,480
Ouch!

737
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,320
Wait, did I do that?

738
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,840
Did I do that?

739
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,560
Who can grab up there?

740
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,040
Oh, man.

741
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:03,840
Okay.

742
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:04,700
Okay.

743
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,100
You got it.

744
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,200
Oh, dang it.

745
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,280
Oh, I tried to grab.

746
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,300
I did not successfully grab.

747
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,860
Oh, okay.

748
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,620
Oh, nice, nice.

749
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,620
What now?

750
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,980
Oh, probably like here.

751
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,680
Oh my god, it's all grabbing.

752
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,780
Oh my god.

753
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,080
Oh, oops.

754
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,580
Wait!

755
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,300
Oh, okay.

756
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:24,820
I'm fine.

757
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:25,580
Okay.

758
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,300
Oh, oh, oh.

759
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,520
You got it.

760
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:28,960
You got it.

761
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,620
I believe in you.

762
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,300
I believe in you.

763
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,620
Do you just hold the trigger?

764
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,520
Will you still?

765
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,440
Yeah, I just hold it.

766
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,480
Oh, why am I down here?

767
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,260
Where are you?

768
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,700
Go up, so go up into the teleporter.

769
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,920
Oh, I see it.

770
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,680
There you go.

771
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,320
Oh, oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

772
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,720
We're fine.

773
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,660
Everything's cool.

774
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,260
Yeah, everything's cool.

775
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,480
Alright.

776
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,440
Oh, that's not it.

777
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,260
Sorry, I thought that was still important.

778
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,540
It's okay.

779
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,900
Okay, I think I...

780
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,120
You threw me to my death?

781
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:56,800
Alright, here I go.

782
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,380
Okay, there you go.

783
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,420
Alright, there you go.

784
00:43:59,620 --> 00:43:59,760
Okay.

785
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:00,760
Okay.

786
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,040
Don't, don't, don't, okay.

787
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,460
Alright.

788
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:02,940
Now what?

789
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,160
Go up there?

790
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,460
I guess, I guess we continue.

791
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,240
Yeah.

792
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,040
Okay, there we go.

793
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:09,740
Okay.

794
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,060
Uh...

795
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,080
Uh...

796
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,720
Oh!

797
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:15,660
Oh!

798
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,320
There's a thing there!

799
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,460
Oh, that worked out.

800
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,120
That worked out.

801
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,660
That's fine.

802
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:20,460
Oh.

803
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,560
Oh, come on.

804
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,240
There we go.

805
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:26,740
There you go.

806
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,200
Yippee!

807
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:27,700
Oh.

808
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

809
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,420
Okay.

810
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:32,920
Okay.

811
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,740
There's probably a secret.

812
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,380
Oh, watch out.

813
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,780
There's probably a secret.

814
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,240
Wait.

815
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,700
Like, to get to the thing?

816
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,760
Oh, wait, no.

817
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,220
It's probably like we need to do a switch first.

818
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,920
you think so hold on i think so

819
00:44:52,010 --> 00:45:02,350

Oh, wait, I went into the clouds there.

823
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,070
Yeah, I don't, mmm.

824
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,150
The switch is probably down here.

825
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:28,950
Oh, somewhere.

826
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:29,710
Somewhere.

827
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,330
Oh, oh, oh, oh, stop, stop, stop.

828
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:34,950
You killed him.

829
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:35,490
Good job?

830
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:36,110
Yeah.

831
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:36,990
You murdered him.

832
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,090
I love the kill.

833
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,190
Oh, and then we do this!

834
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:41,530
Oh!

835
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,010
Oh, and then we redo the whole level.

836
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh, get him!

837
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:47,550
Yeah, nice.

838
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,510
And then we redo the whole level.

839
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,710
I love that.

840
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,490
I watched that happen.

841
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:55,930
Before my very eyes.

842
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,630
That didn't help you at all.

843
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,350
Wait, so you get out of there like this.

844
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:01,630
Or no.

845
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:03,830
Where we go back the opposite.

846
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:04,490
The same.

847
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:05,950
Yeah, we probably go up.

848
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,090
Oh, that's a lot of cats.

849
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,410
Kill him.

850
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,210
Kill him.

851
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,030
Kill him.

852
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,130
Kill him.

853
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,250
Kill him.

854
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,590
Yeah.

855
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,130
Oh, he's dead.

856
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:17,490
He's dead.

857
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,070
Okay, we got him.

858
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:18,530
Yeah.

859
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,470
All right.

860
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:21,270
Oh, wait a minute.

861
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,510
Oh, wait, there we go.

862
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,930
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

863
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,110
I think you have to do that on your own.

864
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:28,330
Okay.

865
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:28,690
There you go.

866
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:29,410
Go, go, go.

867
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,230
Very good.

868
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,670
And we go back over here.

869
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:33,230
Oh.

870
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,130
All right.

871
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,630
We do this hellscape again.

872
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,550
Oh, wait, there's so- Oh my God.

873
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,170
Ah!

874
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:43,690
Okay.

875
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,790
You got it.

876
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:46,070
Yeah.

877
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:46,710
Oh, nice.

878
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,210
Okay.

879
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,490
Now we have to...

880
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,370
Let's go up.

881
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:50,910
Alright.

882
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,150

899
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,350
And then...

900
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,890

I sacrificed- Oh, wait.

913
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,250
Wait, this is so bad.

914
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,490
The cursor's on the screen.

915
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:36,890
Go again?

916
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,530

Sorry.

919
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,310
My cursor was on the screen even though it wasn't on the
game.

920
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,990
It's okay, that's the true, like, game experience.

921
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,210
Like, old game series.

922
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,410

923
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:53,290

926
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,010
Okay.

927
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:57,570
Oh!

928
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:58,310
There we go.

929
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:59,030
Oh, we're fine.

930
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,810
Everything's fine.

931
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,230
Wait, how do we get back inside?

932
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,010
Oh, just kidding.

933
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,130
We just walk through.

934
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,370
Yeah, we just walk.

935
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,350
Oh, and then this is the final...

936
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:07,710
All right.

937
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,070
How do we...

938
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:09,530
Jump.

939
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,530
And then jump.

940
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:12,410
Oh.

941
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,810

00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:54,720

Why would you do that?

1036
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,720
And now I need you to jump.

1037
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,060

1038
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,240

There you go.

1040
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,080
And then, I will not jump.

1041
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,940
My fingers are off the controller.

1042
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:07,320
Okay.

1043
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:07,720

00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:14,620
I got it.

1050
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,240
I got a jet pack and I don't know why.

1051
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,640
You're so insecure.

1052
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,820
I don't know what this does.

1053
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,240
Oh, oh, what is it?

1054
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:24,500
Oh.

1055
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:24,860
No!

00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:32,980
Okay, I got this.

1062
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,840
I don't know what this does.

1063
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,980
It doesn't even do anything.

1064
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,400
No!

1065
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,680
I don't know if that's something you can get.

1066
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,660
I don't know either.

1067
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,520
Oh!

1068
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,020

1071
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,680
There's a boat, yeah.

1072
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,280
I think we have to do this.

1073
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,320
Oh, I think we have to like jetpack through the death area.

1074
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:57,840
Oh!

1075
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,260
I think you're right.

1076
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,180
I think so.

1077
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,400
We have the flappy bird.

1078
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,560
Oh my god.

1079
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,340
Oh my god.

1080
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,260
Wait, where am I?

1081
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:06,660
Oh, here.

1082
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,660
Oh, you made it.

1083
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,020
You made it.

1084
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,840
Yeah, you gotta make it now.

1085
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,400
You gotta make it.

1086
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,760
You got it?

1087
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,580
Oh, nice.

1088
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,240
I made it.

1089
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,640
Oh, okay.

1090
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,360
Oh, oh.

1091
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:16,740
Yeah.

1092
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,980
Oh, do that.

1093
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1094
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,260
You got that?

1095
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:21,760
Yeah, there.

1096
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,020
I don't think I can.

1097
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:23,920
Wait.

1098
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,000
Oh, you got it.

1099
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,340
Oh, there we go.

1100
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,200
You got it.

1101
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,440
Thank you.

1102
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,220
Yeah, nice.

1103
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,960
I push it.

1104
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,160
Yeah, you just have to push it.

1105
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,820
And I fall.

1106
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:35,400
Wee!

1107
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,200
All right!

1108
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,140
Yippee!

1109
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,740
Yay!

1110
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,540
There's a Kappa.

1111
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,940
What does this guy do again?

1112
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:43,480
I can't...

1113
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,040
I don't remember.

1114
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,520
Open.

1115
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,280
Oh.

1116
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:47,840
Oh.

1117
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,220
Uh oh.

1118
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,260
He doesn't hurt us though.

1119
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,040
I do remember that.

1120
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,820
You don't...

1121
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,160
Oh!

1122
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,900
That's where he launches us.

1123
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,860
Yeah, he launches us.

1124
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,200
But there's another gemmy.

1125
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:56,820
Oh no!

1126
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,360
He died!

1127
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,180
I think you might have to get the gemmy.

1128
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,040
I don't know how.

1129
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,660
I didn't even get it.

1130
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,600
How do I get it?

1131
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,280
Oh, maybe I have to throw you over.

1132
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:05,960
Hold on.

1133
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,640
Oh, wow.

1134
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,400
I think I have to throw you over.

1135
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,160
There's spikes right there.

1136
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:08,780
That's crazy.

1137
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,060
Hold on.

1138
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,700
Yeah, there you go.

1139
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:11,200
Oh, no.

1140
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,540
We gotta wait for him to die, I think.

1141
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1142
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,100
Okay, okay.

1143
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:15,600
Now?

1144
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,740
Wait, oh, let me come back.

1145
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,580
Wait, where are you?

1146
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,520
Okay.

1148
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,380
Wait, no.

1149
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,340

1150
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:21,980
Oh, there you go.

1151
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:22,280

Okay.

1191
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,160
Yeah, you see what I'm putting down.

1192
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah.

1193
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:48,500
Okay.

Oh, no.

00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:58,780
Oh, okay, okay.

1200
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,260
How do we?

1201
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,620
Um, I think you got a...

1202
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:03,820

1203
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,160
Oh, there we go!

1204
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,240
But what's up?

1205
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,780
How do we get up there up to the very tippy top?

1206
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,960
Well, there is a...

1207
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,780
Oh, there's a ladder.

1208
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,260
Oh, it does.

1209
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,520
Maybe...

1210
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,380
I think there is.

1211
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,120
Yeah.

1212
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,760
Oh my god.

1213
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,060
Okay.

1214
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,260
Okay.

1215
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,180
We just have to...

1216
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,380
Oh!

1217
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,660
I beeped it.

1218
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,240
I beeped it.

1219
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,120
The very last moment.

1220
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,300
Oh my god.

1221
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,100
Oh my god.

1222
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,380
Okay, we're speed running.

1223
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,000
We're speed running?

1224
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,700
We're speed running?

1225
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,220
Yeah.

1226
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:38,660
Please.

1227
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,300
Give me the block.

1228
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,400
Give me the block.

1229
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,040
Ah!

1230
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,140
Shit.

Guys, you have to understand.

1236
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,700
We're like...

Yeah, we're showing you guys what not to do.

1242
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,300
No, we've just showed them how to clear the level.

1243
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,760
That's true, that's true.

1244
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,200
Wait, we missed one.

1245
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,320
No, that one's like a super secret one only the devs know
about.

1246
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,000
Oh, they put it in there.

1247
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,140
Actually, it's a red herring.

1248
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,140
It never existed at all.

1249
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

1250
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,480
It's true.

1251
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:58,480
They say that there is an extra one, but they just are
trying to make you go mad.

1252
00:56:59,480 --> 00:56:59,880
Yeah.

1253
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,300
What is that air conditioning?

1254
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,420
I know, it's so loud.

1255
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:04,280
Oh.

1256
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:05,880
Oh, hello.

1257
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,280
Oh, you're all the way up there.

1258
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,320
Yeah.

1259
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,380
Me too.

1260
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,260
Wait, what's this one?

1261
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,160
Okay.

1262
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,560
You want to go this way first?

1263
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,880
Oh, I was just going to split up and conquer, divide it.

1264
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,600
Oh, I guess we could.

1265
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,820
Wow, you totally honed that.

1266
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,380
That's fine.

1267
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:25,540
I left a little bit of the ladder to give to you.

1268
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,280
I don't think we can.

1269
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,960
I think you have to launch.

1270
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,720
Yeah, I think so.

1271
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,960
Oh, your body.

1272
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,540
Oh, oh, my body.

1273
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,820
Go down.

1274
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,220
Okay.

1275
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,360
Oh, oh.

1276
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,540
Oh.

1277
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,160
All right.

1278
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:40,760
We got this.

1279
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,020
Okay.

1280
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,800
You launch me.

1281
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,120
Okay.

1282
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:43,700
Okay.

1283
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,280
Oh, okay.

1284
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:44,700
You get ready?

1285
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1286
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:46,480
All right.

1287
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,140
Let me...

1288
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,360
Oh, I think I have to be closer to the...

1289
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:50,840
Okay, okay.

1290
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:51,220
Oh.

1291
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,340
Okay, okay.

1292
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,560
Oh, oh, oh.

1293
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,400
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1294
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:56,860
Okay, that worked out.

1295
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,200
I don't know what this does.

1296
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:00,860
Um...

1297
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,380
I'm going down.

1298
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:03,120
Wait.

1299
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,120
I think I'm stuck here.

1300
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,180
Wait, no, I'm not.

1301
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,360
No, you're good.

1302
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,020
Okay.

1303
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,000
I've never been better.

1304
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,180
I mean, there's like a big mirror.

1305
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:11,880
I'll launch you over here.

1306
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,440
Wait, hold on.

1307
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:13,880
Oh.

1308
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,480
Can I not?

1309
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,160
Oh, I guess not.

1310
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,340
Oh, I guess not.

1311
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,200
What does that do though?

1312
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,480
It opens up so that we can go downstairs.

1313
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,200
Launch me.

1314
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:21,540
Okay.

1315
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,100
We're down the ladder.

1316
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,660
I'm still in a dream.

1317
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,280
What a thrill.

1318
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,420
Oh, are you gonna?

1319
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,160
Yeah, yeah.

1320
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,280
Oh, there you go.

1321
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,020
Okay.

1322
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,200
Oh, I took them both.

1323
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,420
Well, where does this...

1324
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:31,820
It's okay.

1325
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,900
How do I need to go here?

1326
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,080
Can we do this, like, out of border?

1327
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,020
What's going on?

1328
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:36,600
Ouch.

1329
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,810
Aw, man.

1330
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,270
Wait, why am I here?

1331
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,470
Wait, where did you go?

1332
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:43,910
I'm going...

1333
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:44,430
I'm down here.

1334
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,350
Okay, I'll go down there.

1335
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:47,430
Okay, nice.

1336
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,490
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

1337
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,130
Oh.

1338
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,150
Oh, I see.

1339
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:51,010
Yeah, oops.

1340
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:51,550
Oh, goodbye.

1341
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,050
Okay.

1342
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:53,210
All right.

1343
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:53,650
Okay.

1344
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:55,990
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1345
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:56,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1346
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:57,490
It's tricky.

1347
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:00,330
It's really hard.

1348
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,410
Oh, wait, here.

1349
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,830
Let me...

1350
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:03,150
I'm gonna, I'll stop out here.

1351
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:03,610
Stand?

1352
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:04,810
Yeah, if you stand there.

1353
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:05,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1354
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:06,950
Oh, stop.

1355
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:07,930
Oh, stop.

1356
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,250
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

1357
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:11,750
One second.

1358
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:12,590
I'll get it.

1359
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:12,970
Don't worry.

1360
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:13,330
You got it?

1361
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:13,790
You got it?

1362
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,130
I got this.

1363
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,890
I got this.

1364
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:17,670
You got this.

1365
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:18,510
Oops.

1366
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:19,090
There you go.

1367
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:19,530
Oh, oh.

1368
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,090
It's okay.

1369
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,070
Maybe stand.

1370
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,750
Maybe try and like, yeah, maybe the...

1371
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:26,610
Like follow you?

1372
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:27,250
Oops.

1373
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,730
I'll just be like here so that I like constantly...

1374
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:31,830
Oh.

1375
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:32,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1376
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,170
I'm like a Koopa.

1377
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:35,430
Oh, my gosh.

1378
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:36,950
I didn't even press it then.

1379
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:37,970
I didn't even press it then.

1380
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:38,750
Oh, oops.

1381
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:39,270
Okay.

1382
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:39,610
Wait, hold on.

1383
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,290
Let me grab another one.

1384
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,400
I'm like trying to get the sweet spot of pressing it and not
pressing it.

1385
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,200
Sometimes I just don't press it.

1386
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:52,720
Oops.

1387
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,320
Sometimes I press it too early.

1388
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,000
Oh, sometimes I don't press it.

1389
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,580
Oh, oh, it's okay.

1390
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,720
Sometimes I press it too early.

1391
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,900
Sometimes I don't press it.

1392
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,440
Sometimes you just push it.

1393
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,460
Oh, there you go.

1394
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:01,980
I got you.

1395
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,480
Wait, okay, stay on that maybe.

1396
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,360
Now I'm stuck.

1397
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:04,700
I don't know.

1398
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,100
Oh, oh, my thing ran out.

1399
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,240
Yeah, get it?

1400
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:08,580
Grab it?

1401
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:08,800
Yeah.

1402
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,180
What did that do?

1403
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,140
What did my button do?

1404
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,300
I have no clue.

1405
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,060
I don't think I need to stay on this, though, do I?

1406
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,460
What does that do?

1407
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,420
I don't think I need to stay on it.

1408
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:20,980
Maybe not.

1409
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,880
Okay, let's go here.

1410
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,160
So that clears up the thingy.

1411
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,020
I think we have to just keep clearing the level.

1412
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,640
No, no, no, no.

1413
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,620
Don't put it on one end.

1414
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:34,960
No?

1415
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,220
Yeah.

1416
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:51,960
Oh, there you go.

1417
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:52,240
There you go.

1418
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,420
And here, here, too, too, too.

1419
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,540
Okay, okay.

1420
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,560
There you go then.

1421
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,660
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1422
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,300
Okay, okay.

1423
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,480
Okay.

1424
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,740
All right, we need to slide here.

1425
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,240
Careful.

1426
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:02,720
Nice.

1427
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,640
Okay, what did that do?

1428
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,320
Oh, I was so close.

1429
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,560
Oh, nice.

1430
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,140
Wait, turn it off?

1431
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,060
Okay.

1432
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,100
Uh, you gotta turn it off.

1433
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,940
Oh, the other one, I gotta turn it off.

1434
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,100
Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.

1435
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,100
Okay, it's turned off now, okay.

1436
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:25,940
Okay, okay.

1437
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,780
Then you can go over here, maybe?

1438
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,380
Do you trust me?

1439
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,300
Do you trust me?

1440
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,040
Take my hand if you trust me.

1441
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,220

Oh, wait, there's so many down there.

01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:49,330
Look at all of them.

Can you, can you, like, bring it over here, maybe?

1511
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:53,790
Or is he just stuck there?

1512
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,390
Oh, wait, wait, let me get on your head.

1513
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:56,830

Okay, wait.

1515
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,010
I don't know if this is the right way.

1516
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,370
Wait, I don't think it's the other way.

1517
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:02,370
Yeah.

1518
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:04,370
Like, wait.

1519
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,470
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:10,670
on the thingy.

1522
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,230
What?

1523
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:12,530
Maybe?

1524
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:13,370
This thing?

1525
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:14,010
The button?

1526
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:14,570
Yeah.

1527
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:16,950
I don't know what that does, but that definitely does.

1528
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:17,950
We have to turn those off.

1529
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,010
I don't think we can...

1530
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:22,110
Wait, I think we just... I think I just screwed that up.

1531
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,470
No, no, I think it's fine.

1532
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,350
I think that's what they wanted, maybe.

1533
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,210
I don't think so.

1534
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,170
Because... Oh.

1535
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,650
And then we go back up here.

1536
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:33,690
Maybe.

1537
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,950
Oh!

1538
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:36,290
Oh!

1539
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:37,410
What is it?

1540
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:40,050
We go back up Oh, wait, no.

1541
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,290
We gotta get back.

1542
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,150
Oh, wait.

1543
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,170
Where's the teleporter?

1544
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:47,290
It's, um...

1545
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:51,830
Oh, it's up there.

1546
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,210
It's up there.

1547
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:56,790
Yeah.

1548
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:01,490
And the only way to go back up there is to go here.

1549
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,630
We have to go back up.

1550
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:05,850
No, this is not.

1551
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,200
Yeah, because if you see, uh, we got the green.

1552
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:17,200
guy.

1553
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:18,720
Oh, wait, here.

1554
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,580
You can prove your... You can prove your...

1555
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:20,760
I can do it.

1556
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1557
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:22,880
You got this.

1558
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,660
Okay, here we go, everybody.

1559
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:26,420
You got it.

1560
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:26,940
You got it.

1561
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,040
You got it.

1562
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,160
You got it.

1563
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:31,600
Okay, nice.

1564
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,220
Okay, now what do I do?

1565
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,700
Now you gotta space out your jumps really well because you
gotta make it to this ladder.

1566
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,600
Oh, why would I do that?

1567
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,180
Oh.

1568
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,760
Why would they do that?

1569
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,620
Why would John Battle Blossom do that?

1570
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,920
Why would they do that?

1571
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,600
Wait, I'm gonna make it, don't worry.

1572
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:55,980
You got it, you got it.

1573
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:57,180
Okay.

1574
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:57,820
Okay, there you go.

1575
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:58,340
All right.

1576
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,020
I got it.

1577
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:01,480
There you go.

1578
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,440
There you go, isn't it?

1579
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,280
Okay.

1580
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,500
And then go up here.

1581
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,040
Oh, you can use my body.

1582
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,140
Oh, it's gone now.

1583
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:09,900
Uh-oh.

1584
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:11,940
Uh-oh.

1585
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,520
Okay.

1586
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,120
Because now we have...

1587
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:15,880
That wasn't that far.

1588
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,480
We need to get rid of the yellow...

1589
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,040
I mean, not yellow, the white...

1590
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,180
Oh, but was there a button for it?

1591
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,200
Was there a button for it?

1592
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,440
Oh, that's where the cat is.

1593
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,300
But where is...

Oh, I see it.

1596
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,240

01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:24,480
Oh, shoot.

1609
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,980

1657
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,280
Dude, the people who make levels like these are crazy.

01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:11,780
I know.

1659
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,760
And you solved it.

1660
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,460
Oh, we can play a puzzle game and really just die.

1661
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:19,920
Oh, it calls him.

1662
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,460
It calls him.

1663
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:21,660
Wait.

1664
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,340
Oh, wait, oh, what do you...

1665
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,180

1666
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:27,360
Ah!

1667
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,320

1668
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:31,700

Oh, I see him, though.

1672
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:37,620
Oh, sorry.

1673
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,500
Ah, my speed!

1674
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,140
It calls back both of them.

1675
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:40,820
That's crazy.

1676
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,220
Yeah, it's okay.

1677
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,700
Just don't die.

1678
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,500
Okay, that one you can use.

1679
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:46,920
Oh, ah, no!

1680
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,180
Okay.

1681
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,040
Maybe we should go at one at a time.

1682
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:54,680
Oh, wait.

1683
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,080

1684
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,120
Sorry.

1685
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,100

Or it's from...

1711
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,360
No, it doesn't seem like it.

1712
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:10,700
Okay.

1713
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,560
Okay, it literally hates me.

01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,880
Wait, why did he room again?

1715
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,320

1720
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,020
Is this a secret?

1721
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,160
Where is a secret?

1722
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,740
It has to be somewhere, right?

1723
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,260
Um...

1724
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,040

1725
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:30,940
Oh, hold on.

1726
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,160

01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,280
crawling in this way.

1728
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:35,260

I'll just like... Oh my god, sorry.

1802
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:35,270
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1803
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:36,510
Okay, we're fine.

1804
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,030
Alright.

1805
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,410
There we go.

1806
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,250
Oh, you probably have to go to the teleporter.

1807
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:43,770
Oh, no, never mind.

1808
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:46,330
There you go.

1809
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,820
Oh, I wasn't close enough.

1810
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:52,260
Bye, bud.

1811
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:52,780
It's okay.

1812
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,400
Hey, wait a minute.

1813
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,000
Ah, damn it.

1814
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,040
Okay.

1815
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,380
Oh, thank you.

1816
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,980
Oh, don't you dare.

1817
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:10,640
Wait, why did I go backwards?

1818
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,120
I don't know.

1819
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,080
Thank God.

1820
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:25,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, We died together!

1821
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,280
We died...

1822
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,320
You didn't die that time.

1823
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,840
We died together!

1824
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,580
Oh, we died together for you.

1825
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:35,540
We died...

1826
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:35,940
Oh, shoot.

1827
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,640
Oh, shoot.

1828
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,740
Thanks for getting that.

1829
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,340
Oh, shoot.

1830
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,600
Oh, I didn't see that was there.

1831
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,700
We died together!

1832
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,800
We died together!

1833
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,520
We died together!

1834
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,920
Okay, now this goes...

1835
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,520
Okay, you're right.

1836
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,620
I do think...

1837
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,460
Wait, what is this?

1838
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:52,940
Oh, what?

1839
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:53,860
Okay.

1840
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:54,460
Okay.

1841
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:58,880
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo.

1842
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,680
Wait, one more time?

1843
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,620
Okay, there we go.

1844
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:05,620
Okay.

1845
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:06,940
Okay, he's angry.

1846
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,180
Oh, he's gonna be released!

1847
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:08,680
Ah!

1848
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:09,700
Ah!

1849
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,340
Ah!

1850
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:10,820
Ah!

1851
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,120
Ah!

1852
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,800
You hate me.

1853
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:15,940
Wait, um...

1854
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:19,440
What's the- Oh, so now it's on the green blocks.

1855
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,400
Oh, you got this?

1856
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,400
Uh, I'm gonna try- Woo!

1857
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,760
Wait, you might have to launch me or you launch me.

1858
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,900
Okay, okay, that didn't work.

1859
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:30,860
No, it didn't at all.

1860
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,180
Or actually go on the ladder, go on the...

1861
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh yeah, yeah, use my head, use my head.

1862
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1863
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,760
Oh, oh, there we go.

1864
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:39,220
Alright.

1865
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,480
Get the...

1866
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,060
There you go.

1867
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:41,440
Okay, there you go.

1868
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:41,800
There you go.

1869
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:42,780
Very nice.

1870
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:48,820
Oh shit, he's jumping!

1871
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,080
How do we get away from this guy?

1872
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,060
I don't, I guess like, maybe one of us just has to be a
sacrifice.

1873
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,560
Oh, I'm next.

1874
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,540
I'm next, baby.

1875
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,440
I'm next.

1876
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:02,980
No, no, no.

1877
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:03,860
I'm next.

1878
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,820
Oh, my bad.

1879
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:07,500
Save yourself!

1880
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,480
Thank you, save yourself!

1881
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,200
Save yourself!

1882
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,200
Oh my god.

1883
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:15,920
Mmm, yummy.

1884
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,040
Okay.

1885
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:19,700
Okay.

1886
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,460
Tasty, guys.

1887
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,180
We have to redo this entire thing.

1888
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,720
But the other way around.

1889
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,640
But the other way around.

1890
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:31,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1891
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,120
Wait, there we go.

1892
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,240
You got it.

1893
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,680
Oh, oh, oh.

1894
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,460
I don't need your hands.

1895
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:39,680
Oh, whatever.

1896
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,080
Oh, shoot.

1897
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,140
I might need you.

1898
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,660
Yeah, now you need me.

1899
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,660
Oh, there you go.

1900
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,140
Oh, wait.

1901
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:49,620
Oh, oh, oh.

1902
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:50,360
One more time.

1903
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,680
Maybe you should just...

1904
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,880
Maybe you just go on my head.

1905
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,220
Think about the avatar, Rod.

1906
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,100
Why did someone say that?

1907
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:58,780
Why did you say that?

1908
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,940
Why did you say it like that?

1909
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:00,900
Why did you say it like that?

1910
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,100
Why did you say it like that?

1911
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,320
I need you to hold...

1912
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:04,620
Oh, wait.

1913
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:05,080
No, no, no, no.

1914
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:05,620
Okay, we're good.

1915
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,460
And then we go this way.

1916
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,400
And then we go this way.

1917
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,560
We go this way.

1918
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,240
And then we go...

1919
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:14,840
Launch.

1920
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:15,500
I'll launch you.

1921
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,600
Okay, thank you.

1922
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,260
And then...

1923
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:18,940
There you go.

1924
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:19,320
There you go.

1925
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:19,740
Okay.

1926
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:20,920
Okay.

1927
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,440
Oh no, we have to redo all of this too.

1928
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,360
Wait.

1929
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,500
We kind of borked it.

1930
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,300
Yeah, yeah.

1931
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:26,560
There you go.

1932
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,180
There you go.

1933
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,060
Okay, there you go.

1934
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:29,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1935
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,620
And then...

1936
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,260
Oh, oh, there you go.

1937
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:32,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1938
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,280
Oh, wait, wait, this one.

01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:35,900
Oh, this one.

01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:36,380
Oh, stop.

No, no, no, move the other one.

01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:38,820
Move the other one.

I'm trying to every time I face this way.

1944

Well, whatever.

Yeah, who cares?

1957
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:19,380
We're done.

1958
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,280
Who gives a poof?

1959
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:22,800
Who gives a poof?

1960
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,140
There we go.

1961
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:26,740
Yeah!

1962
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,100
Now you guys know it's not those two blocks.

1963
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,260
You gotta go up.

1964
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:33,280
Yeah!

1965
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,860
This is a playthrough for your...

1966
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1967
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,080
Okay, this is the last level before the final idea.

1968
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,700
No, I think there's two more, no?

1969
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,600
Or one more?

1970
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,400
One more door?

1971
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,040
Nope.

1972
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,480
There is one more door, but this is the last one before that
door, I think.

1973
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,460
We have a friend that is trapped.

1974
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,160
He's 12.

1975
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,480
Come here!

1976
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:56,580
Pew!

1977
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,320
Take my hand, pink fellow.

1978
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,160
Take my hand.

1979
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:01,440
Oh.

1980
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:02,520
No, no, no, no.

1981
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:03,380
Take my hand.

1982
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,160
Take my hand.

1983
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,060
I love you more.

1984
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,580
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1985
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,440
No, no, no, take my hand.

1986
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,780
My hand is not...

1987
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,440
My hand's cleaner.

1988
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,140
I washed it.

1989
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,720
I washed it.

1990
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,080
Berrybug does not wash your hands.

1991
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,960
I do wash my hands.

1992
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,160
Damn it.

1993
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,860
Take my head.

1994
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,940
Oh, we're back at the beginning.

1995
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,460
Wait, there's a teleporter here.

1996
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:24,320
Oh.

1997
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,060
Wait, oh, we can't do that.

1998
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:26,540
Oh, dang.

1999
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,660
Okay, we can't do that yet.

2000
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,020
Mental note of that.

2001
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:30,720
Mental note.

2002
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:31,940
Yeah.

2003
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:35,520
All right.

2004
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,640
Oh, yeah.

2005
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:39,280
I'm hard.

2006
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:40,000
Wait, what does this do?

2007
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:40,940
Oh, it launches me?

2008
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:41,140
Okay.

2009
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:41,360
Okay.

2010
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,160
Um...

2011
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,000
And then I guess...

2012
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,200
Oh!

2013
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:45,820
Ew!

2014
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,240
Oh, that's messed up.

2015
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,000
I got it though?

2016
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,000
Oh, look at him.

2017
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:49,780
I turned it off.

2018
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,140
Oh.

2019
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:50,860
Ouchie, ouch.

2020
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,880
Kill his ass!

2021
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:53,920
Kill his ass!

2022
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,040
Oh, whoa, whoa.

2023
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:55,940
How did I get down there?

2024
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:56,360
There you go.

2025
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:56,720
There you go.

2026
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,380
There's a second one.

2027
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,200
Oh, I just realized.

2028
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,760
Yeah, there's there's multiple.

2029
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:00,700
It's messed up.

2030
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,160
Okay, now what?

2031
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,620
Wait, but there's a...

2032
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,740
He's on something.

2033
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:05,720
Oh.

2034
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:06,820
Oh.

2035
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,240
Oh, wait.

2036
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:10,740
What?

2037
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:10,860
What?

2038
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,300
And then...

2039
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,640
Oh, I think that's if you mess it up.

2040
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:16,560
Right?

2041
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,600
Oh, you're right.

2042
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,900
Oh, maybe I need to come back or...

2043
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:21,620
And grab it.

2044
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,320
Can you...

2045
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,120
If you throw it...

2046
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:24,380
Maybe?

2047
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,280
Can you throw it above the clouds or...

2048
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:26,640
Oh, no.

2049
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:27,580
Okay, hold on.

2050
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:28,680
Maybe...

2051
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,640
Oh, oh, oh.

2052
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:30,660
Okay.

2053
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:31,900
Wait.

2054
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,240
I don't think I can.

2055
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,380
I think we need the green blocks to disappear.

2056
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:37,900
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2057
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:38,500
I think you're right.

2058
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,060
I think you're right.

2059
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,360
We'll just let it keep doing that.

2060
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,260
We have that emotion.

2061
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,900
Yeah, we have that emotion, exactly.

2062
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,280
We'll just let it do its thing there.

2063
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,660

01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,220

01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,600
I mean, maybe we just need this for now, and then...

2069
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,520
Yeah, I don't know.

2070
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,020
Uh...

2071
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:43,100
Oh, how did he get over there?

2072
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:44,620
Get out of here, man.

2073
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,700
Oh, you got him.

2074
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,560
You think...

2075
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,320
Should I stay on that, you think?

2076
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,240
And you want to...

2077
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,680
That's what I was thinking, honestly, like...

2078
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,200
You can't make your way back without...

2079
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,380
Oh, no, there's a boulder now.

2080
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,020
Oh, there's another...

2081
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,980
There's another trigger.

2082
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,180
Okay, I see it.

2083
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:00,660
I see it.

2084
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:01,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2085
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:04,720
Nice.

2086
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,440
Just kill him!

2087
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,400
Kill him!

2088
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,720
Kill him!

2089
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,040
Ah.

2090
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:11,560
Ah.

2091
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:17,600
Okay, don't like...

2092
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,600
Oh, they're kind of nice.

2093
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,020
They're, they, like...

2094
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:21,420
They, like, puddle you.

2095
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,200
Oh my god.

2096
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:22,820
Wait, they're not nice.

2097
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:23,480
They're not nice.

2098
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,060
Oh, oh, we killed him.

2099
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:26,560
We're fine.

2100
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:27,340
Okay, okay, we're good.

2101
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,540
Alright, wait a second though.

2102
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,360
Wait, come back though.

2103
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:29,660
Come back.

2104
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:30,640
We gotta go back up there.

2105
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:31,800
Why?

2106
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:32,040
Why?

2107
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:32,940
Because there's a jemmy.

2108
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,480
Oh, okay.

2109
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,000
Yeah.

2110
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,820
You gotta be on my head, or I gotta be on your head.

2111
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:38,660
There you go.

2112
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:39,400
Jump him.

2113
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,200
There you go.

2114
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:41,960
Okay, there you go.

2115
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:42,640
Okay, nice.

2116
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,800
Okay, sis.

2117
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,200
We gave him the gift of sweet release.

2118
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,460
Oh, it made it in there.

2119
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,060
Okay, nice.

2120
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:51,820
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2121
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,220
Thank you.

2122
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:53,720
Thank you.

2123
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,060
Now...

2124
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:59,480
Now our friend is been ejected.

2125
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:00,160
Oh, he's free.

2126
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:00,860
He's free, yeah.

2127
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,320
He's free.

2128
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2129
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,680
There's probably a secret here.

2130
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,140
Hold on.

2131
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:08,700
Hold on.

2132
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,680
What do I do with it?

2133
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,020
Oh, wait.

2134
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,940
Wait, what do I do with him?

2135
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,460
I think you just cried to get him through the teleporter.

2136
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,260
Or maybe not.

2137
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,140
He doesn't follow me.

2138
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,320
Oh, yes, he does.

2139
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:26,860
Oh, no, he does.

2140
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,620
I need your help.

2141
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:31,600
Wait, there's a ball.

2142
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,180
I'm all here!

2143
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,840
Oh, I see it.

2144
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,740
Oh, but there's a gemmy here at the bottom.

2145
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,180
Oh, it's okay.

2146
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:40,880
I'll make it.

2147
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:41,420
I'll make it.

2148
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,140
Oh, shit.

2149
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,060
Oh wait, hold on.

2150
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:47,500
Hold on.

2151
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,680
How do I...

2152
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,300
How do I...

2153
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,580
How do I...

2154
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,000
Do you need me to come up?

2155
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,180
Wait, there you go.

2156
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,940
Oh, you got it.

2157
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,260
Yeah, yeah.

2158
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:56,800
There you go.

2159
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,160
Wait, there's definitely a secret in there, don't you think?

2160
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,340
You think so?

2161
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:00,620
It's okay.

2162
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:00,880
Whatever.

2163
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,780
Like maybe a hidden gem.

2164
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,780
Okay, what do you need me for?

2165

2301
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,600

Up.

2480
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,460
There is a shrimp here.

2481
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:22,720
There is a shrimp here.

2482
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,940
There's, like, a secret level, but I don't know if we want
to mess around with it.

2483
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,040

How do we...

2494
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:53,710
Oh, I guess we might have to bring the rock over.

2495
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:55,150
Yeah, I think so.

2496
01:36:55,630 --> 01:36:57,410

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,130
Okay, you're good.

01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:06,750
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:36,690
We're fine.

2530
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:37,310
Oh.

2531
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:39,730
Get him out of here.

2532
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:40,490
Okay.

2533
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:41,110
You got him?

2534
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:41,510
Nice.

2535
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:42,630
Nice.

2536
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,930
Oh my god.

2537
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:46,850
Okay.

2538
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:47,250
Whatever.

2539
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:48,710
Oh, my God.

2540
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:50,710
Okay, okay.

2541
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,130
If I could kill him, too.

2542
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:55,580
Wait, start...

2543
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:56,100
Oh, shoot.

2544
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,380
Okay, there's a...

2545
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:57,720
I think...

2546
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,300
Is that a fan?

2547
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:02,090
Get out of here.

2548
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:02,670
Get out of here.

2549
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:03,250
Get out of here.

2550
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:06,050
Ouchie.

2551
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:06,890
Oh, God.

2552
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:07,270
Oh, God.

2553
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:08,530
Oh, my God.

2554
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:10,310
There's a fan or something somewhere.

2555
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:11,830
Oh, yeah.

2556
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,010
There's a guy at the top.

2557
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:13,770
Okay, I thought it was a man.

2558
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:15,290
No, stick him away.

2559
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:16,010
Oh, my God.

2560
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:16,850
Okay, you got...

2561
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:18,470
Oh!

2562
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,750
Oh, my God.

2563
01:38:21,010 --> 01:38:21,510
This is crazy!

2564
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:22,990
Oh my god.

2565
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:24,410
Where am I?

2566
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:25,290
Oh my god!

2567
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:28,010
Oh they come back down!

2568
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:28,910
They come back down!

2569
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:29,790
Oh my god.

2570
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:30,330
No!

2571
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:32,030
What are you doing?

2572
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:32,870
Okay.

2573
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:33,750
Okay, okay.

2574
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:34,170
Nice, nice.

2575
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:34,710
Okay.

2576
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:36,670
Oh yeah, that's the same.

2577
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:37,150
Okay.

2578
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:38,130
Nice, nice, nice.

2579
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:39,350
Ah!

2580
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:40,970
I was so close!

2581
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:41,590
Oh my god.

2582
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:43,430
Ah no!

2583
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:45,170
Okay.

2584
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,970
Ah!

2585
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:52,350
Got it.

2586
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:52,490
Okay.

2587
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:53,070
You got it.

2588
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,130
Holy cow.

2589
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:55,470
What is this?

2590
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:56,790
Oh!

2591
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,230
Ah!

2592
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:58,550
It releases them!

2593
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:59,030
Oh!

2594
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:05,270
Sorry if I'm hitting you.

2595
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:06,110
It's okay, it's okay.

2596
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,620
There's a key here!

2597
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,600
There's a big ol' key!

2598
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,020
A key?

2599
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:18,020
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!

2600
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,580
Oh my god, how did that not hit you?

2601
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:22,580
How did that not hit you?

2602
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,440
You motherfucker.

2603
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:24,340
How?

2604
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,640
Get him!

2605
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,060
I got the... I got the...

2606
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:28,700
I got the...

2607
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:29,260
Okay, that's all we needed.

2608
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:29,740
That's all we needed.

2609
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,200
Oh, there is a key.

2610
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,160
Wait, can you step on that?

2611
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,060
Can you step on that?

2612
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:34,880
Step on what?

2613
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2614
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:35,580
This?

2615
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,060
The red...

2616
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:37,280
Oh, here.

2617
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:37,760
I would step on it.

2618
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,220
Oh, I see.

2619
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:39,700
No!

2620
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:42,920
Oh, my God!

2621
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:45,020
Hell yeah.

2622
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,000
Look at us.

2623
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,800
That was easy, dude.

2624
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:49,940
That one wasn't so bad.

2625
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,360
This game's so easy, man.

2626
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,480
This game's so easy.

2627
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,120
This game's so easy, man.

2628
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,580
Okay, maybe we can do the hardest.

2629
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,640
I admire your tenacity.

2630
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,260
Oh, is there more?

2631
01:39:59,500 --> 01:39:59,680
Oh, oh.

2632
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,420
For sure.

2633
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,780
But things have really gotten out of control here.

2634
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:09,820
all quickly gone from precocious lovable scamps to
problematic liabilities how ridiculous are we trying to say

2635
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:16,900
people on this twisted island or perhaps we're the crazy
ones and they're all sane what a twist that would be a twist

2636
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:24,040
no that's impossible these guys are bad poop crazy we gotta
get the haddy asap as soon as beer home like a bullet mega

2637
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:29,880
supery fast but you gotta get through that vault and get
that key oh we need to go to a vault is more dangerous than

2638
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:34,520
telling a girl Wait, that's in now, it's crazy.

2639
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:37,980
You're gonna be killed until you're dead but, you know?

2640
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,460
Put your big girl panties on.

2641
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:40,420
Everybody has problems.

2642
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:41,780
Yeah, put your big girl panties on.

2643
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,200
Put your big girl panties on...

2644
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,500
Put your big girl panties on.

2645
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,280
Put your big girl panties on.

2646
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:48,400
Put your big girl panties on!

2647
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,520
Their spirits have grown far too weary in children.

2648
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:51,760
Wait, that looks like you guys!

2649
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:52,820
It's an Iwoo!

2650
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,220
Rich, buttery sustenance!

2651
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:55,960
Is a slaughter-y sustenance?

2652
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,380
You guys eat buns, тон?

2653
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:57,420
Buttery sustenance?

2654
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,300
By killing Hattie and starting this insanity all over again.

2655
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,280
Iwoo, don't drink the butter!

2656
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,160
What a counterproductive-y-sauce!

2657
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:04,120
You guys drink butter?

2658
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:07,560
When will they shatter their shackles of ignorance?

2659
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:08,380
Don't drink the butter!

2660
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:10,520
The butter!

2661
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:13,820
When will they stop being stupid, crazy, dumb jerks?

2662
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,280
Everyone's kind of sick of it.

2663
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:17,520
But I guess there's no reasoning with madness.

2664
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:18,980
Or cats, for that matter.

2665
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:20,840
Seriously, try talking sense into a cat.

2666
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,140
They just stare at you with their life.

2667
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,160
It's so true.

2668
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,180
It's true.

2669
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:27,260
It looks like Pikachu.

2670
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,900
Wait, the guy is pointing at you, baby.

2671
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:34,280
Oh, he was!

2672
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:34,940
I guess.

2673
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:39,280
So are you ready for the most importantly important mission
of your entire life?

2674
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,360
Okay, now we lock it.

2675
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:41,860
It's time to show these guys.

2676
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,260
They picked the wrong boat of friends to tangle me.

2677
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:47,600
If you just hold on a little longer, homie, we're coming for
you.

2678
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:50,920
It'd be nice if you could meet us halfway, but, you know,
whatever.

2679
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,540
We're gonna save you, Hattie.

2680
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:54,840
Are we?

2681
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,220
Do we care about this guy?

2682
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:56,600
We are.

2683
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:57,140
We are.

2684
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:57,480
We are.

2685
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,700
Oh, my controller DC'd.

2686
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:00,240
Hold on.

2687
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:03,160
I'm going to...

2688
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:04,540
gone on without you.

2689
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:05,860
Don't say that.

2690
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,600
Okay, okay, we're good.

2691
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:07,960
Don't say that.

2692
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:10,300
Berrybug has a venomous issue.

2693
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:12,960
Oh, I do.

2694
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,120
Oh, wait, oh, these go!

2695
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,880
Wait, we didn't do the gotcha yet.

2696
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,220
Oh, so true!

2697
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:18,480
Wait, where is it?

2698
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,100
Oh, wait, maybe this is just the level start.

2699
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,120
That's Hattie!

2700
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,380
That's the Hattie!

2701
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,320
He's in there!

2702
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:24,520
He's in there!

2703
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,180
My big head is blocking him.

2704
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,340
That's a big level behind.

2705
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,880
Oh, this does seem like the final part.

2706
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:34,020
Oh my gosh.

2707
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,700
Look at this.

2708
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:36,720
Metal Gear.

2709
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:37,320
Oh, no shop?

2710
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,340
There's got to be a shop.

2711
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,340
Oh, stop.

2712
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:42,640
There you go.

2713
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:45,940
Oh, well, I guess you don't really need to go down or up
there, huh?

2714
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:46,520
Yeah, yeah.

2715
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,800
There's no shop, but really?

2716
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,080
You're going to...

2717
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,560
Yeah, do you want to go back to the other place to get the
shop?

2718
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2719
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,660

01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,660
Yeah, we got to do our gambles.

01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,820

01:42:59,560 --> 01:42:59,940

01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:29,000

All right.

01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:33,920
Let's go.

2734
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,380
Hattie, we'll get you out there once we finish.

2735
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,820
We'll get you out, Hattie.

2736
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:38,680
All right.

2737
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,160
What are you going to, are you going to spin?

2738
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:40,520
Yep.

2739
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:41,480
Triangle, man.

2740
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:42,540
Triangle.

2741
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:44,300
Oh, cute.

2742
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,460
That one's cute.

2743
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:48,780
Oh, dinosaur.

2744
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:50,580
Dinosaur.

2745
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:51,960
That looks like the iguana don.

2746
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:53,940
Oh, I, no, it does not.

2747
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:57,400
Kind of did.

2748
01:43:57,620 --> 01:43:58,420
Kind of did.

2749
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,200
No.

2750
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:00,280
Not really.

2751
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:02,080
Oh, whoopsies.

2752
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,740
I meant to go here.

2753
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:05,240
Yeah.

2754
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,080
And roll in the circle.

2755
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:08,940
Oh, mustache.

2756
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,000
Oh, oh.

2757
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:14,860
Oh, a bird.

2758
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,580
Oh, a bird.

2759
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:18,340
Electrical socket.

2760
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,160
Okay, that's it.

2761
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:20,880
That's all I have.

2762
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:21,800
Yeah, that's all I have, too.

2763
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:22,720
We got weapons.

2764
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,220
How much?

2765
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:25,420
Is it?

2766
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:26,000
Oh, it's five.

2767
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:27,280
I think we have all the weapons.

2768
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,620
I think so, too, right?

2769
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,320
Okay, yeah.

2770
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,740
Yeah, I won't even let us do it anymore.

2771
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,340
All right, whatever.

2772
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,420
All right, it's time to save after that break.

2773
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:37,920
It's time to save our friend.

2774
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,220
We're very serious about it.

2775
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,680
I mean, he waited all this time.

2776
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:43,120
He could wait, like, two more seconds.

2777
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:43,800
Oh, whoops.

2778
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:45,420
That's true.

2779
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,140
But what if those two seconds are, like, life or death?

2780
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:52,280
When has it ever been that two seconds are life or death?

2781
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,720
Like, like...

2782
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:56,800
Whatever.

2783
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,420
Nobody ever can give an example.

2784
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:04,840
I'm sure there are certain circumstances in which it's life
or death for two seconds.

2785
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:06,900
No.

2786
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:07,880
I'm sure.

2787
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:08,360
No.

2788
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:08,920
Yeah.

2789
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,020
It's one of the...

2790
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:11,240
It's one of the...

2791
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,500
Also, Barry, it's been almost two hours.

2792
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:15,020
Oh, shoot.

2793
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:15,740
We're playing the game.

2794
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:20,460
Well, maybe I didn't mean an hour in, like, regular time.

2795
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,360
Maybe I meant it in, like, bug time or something.

2796
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:22,860
You don't know.

2797
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:23,140
Wait.

2798
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:23,440
Oh.

2799
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:24,660
Oh, goodbye.

2800
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:25,660
Isn't that funny?

2801
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,560
I think I have to launch you over.

2802
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2803
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,820
Come here, come here, come here, run.

2804
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,020
Okay, I'm here.

2805
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,120
Okay, okay.

2806
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:38,660
Oh, okay.

2807
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,020
I think we need to time this.

2808
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:40,780
Yeah.

2809
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:41,440
Okay.

2810
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:42,340
Oh.

2811
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,200
Okay, here.

2812
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:43,760
Go, go.

2813
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:43,900
Oh.

2814
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,540
Did we just get worse at this game?

2815
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:51,240
I think so.

2816
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:52,120
Oh.

2817
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,860
Wait for me.

2818
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:56,640
It's over.

2819
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,260
Wait for me.

2820
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:58,000
Okay, okay, okay.

2821
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,480
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

2822
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,200
Oh, nice!

2823
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:02,960
It says now I hold, I wait for you.

2824
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,160
Do you think so?

2825
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,520
Oh, thank you!

2826
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,480
Oh, thank you.

2827
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:09,960
Oh, we're fine.

2828
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,320
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

2829
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:15,100
You do that, and then...

2830
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:16,760
I needed to turn off, though.

2831
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:18,320
I needed to turn off those.

2832
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,020
It's like a little bit...

2833
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:20,480
There we go.

2834
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:22,380
Oh, okay.

2835
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:22,860
Okay.

2836
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:24,620
That...

2837
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,120
Oh, my God.

2838
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:26,880
Oh, and then I'll do this?

2839
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:28,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2840
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:29,760
Thank you.

2841
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:30,180
Okay, nice.

2842
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,740
Okay, let go.

2843
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:32,320
Okay.

2844
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:33,700
Alright.

2845
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,300
Oh, okay.

2846
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,080
Um, how do we get up there?

2847
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:40,460
Oh, sorry.

2848
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,460
Oh, sorry.

2849
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,020
Okay.

2850
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,440
There is a gem there, but...

2851
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,440
Oh, there is, yeah.

2852
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:51,340
You can get it.

2853
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:52,200
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

2854
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:53,680
I believe in you.

2855
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,560
I can get it.

2856
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:55,060
I can get it.

2857
01:46:58,810 --> 01:46:59,800
I believe in you.

2858
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:01,730
Thank you.

2859
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:02,690
Thank you for believing.

2860
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:04,590
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2861
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:05,770
I've gone without you.

2862
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:06,670
Oh, we don't need gems.

2863
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:07,450
Whatever, man.

2864
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:07,870
What?

2865
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:08,790
What even is that?

2866
01:47:08,810 --> 01:47:10,270
Look, exits open, guys.

2867
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:11,010
Exits open.

2868
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:12,250
Yeah, who care?

2869
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:14,390
Oh, nice.

2870
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:15,770
Oh, don't do that.

2871
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:17,310
Yeah.

2872
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:18,490
Don't do that.

2873
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:19,370
Don't do it.

2874
01:47:19,390 --> 01:47:20,150
I did.

2875
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:22,650
Don't follow my example.

2876
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:24,930
Oh, okay.

2877
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:25,470
Thank you.

2878
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:25,830
There you go.

2879
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:26,150
There you go.

2880
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:27,510
And then I throw you over here.

2881
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:27,930
Yeah.

2882
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:28,530
Okay.

2883
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:30,030
And then...

2884
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:30,430
Oh, wait.

2885
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:31,570
I don't think you needed to throw me.

2886
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:32,510
That's fine, though.

2887
01:47:32,830 --> 01:47:34,170
Um, there's a...

2888
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:35,070
There's a...

2889
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:36,290
Okay, get in there, maybe.

2890
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:38,150
And then go to the...

2891
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:38,810
Yeah, yeah, nice.

2892
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:39,930
Okay, where did that go?

2893
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:41,810
Uh, I think I...

2894
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:42,590
Open something.

2895
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:44,210
Oh, okay, hi.

2896
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:45,110
I'm here with you.

2897
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:45,490
Okay.

2898
01:47:45,490 --> 01:47:46,210
Oh, let go of that?

2899
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:46,710
Okay, yeah.

2900
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:48,790
Nice.

2901
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:49,510
Oh!

2902
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:53,030
Oh, what in the world is going on here?

2903
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:56,110
Okay, so you jump, and then when you get over there, I'll
let go.

2904
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:57,690
Oh, oh, oh!

2905
01:47:57,710 --> 01:48:01,050
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

2906
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:02,590
Okay, we gotta time this.

2907
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:04,410
There you go.

2908
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:06,810
How do we do this, though?

2909
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:07,990
Oh, okay.

2910
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:10,530
And then, and then I, okay, I see, I see, okay.

2911
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:12,110
Do you want to time it?

2912
01:48:12,170 --> 01:48:13,050
Are you a good rhythm gamer?

2913
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:14,290
Yeah.

2914
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:15,510
Okay.

2915
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:17,530
Oh, okay, sorry.

2916
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:19,270
And then, and then.

2917
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:20,290
Oh.

2918
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:22,290
Okay, this is tough.

2919
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:23,550
Okay.

2920
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:25,210
Okay, nice.

2921
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:26,570
Oh.

2922
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:31,010
What's controlling the other blocks?

2923
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:32,650
I think it's just a timing thing.

2924
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:38,850
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2925
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:40,510
It was close.

2926
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:41,430
Oh, it was close.

2927
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:44,010
You got a P?

2928
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:44,590
Okay.

2929
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:46,910
Go P. And I'll be here.

2930
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,590
Oh, oh, wait, sorry.

2931
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:50,370
I did that too early.

2932
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:50,950
Oh, okay.

2933
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:51,690
Maybe you should do it.

2934
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:53,710
I'm not a good at timing.

2935
01:48:58,090 --> 01:48:58,970
Okay, nice.

2936
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:00,410
Nice!

2937
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:02,710
Yeah, you're much better at the timing thing.

2938
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:04,310
Oh, no, you have to do it!

2939
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:07,670
Oh, God.

2940
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,350
Wait, you're, like, inside of it.

2941
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:12,530
Oh, I was close.

2942
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:14,050
I probably will respawn here.

2943
01:49:14,170 --> 01:49:14,890
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

2944
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:19,550
Oh, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine!

2945
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:20,390
Until...

2946
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:20,870
No!

2947
01:49:21,490 --> 01:49:21,930
Until...

2948
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:23,310
I died.

2949
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:26,130
Okay.

2950
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:29,630
Oh, no, wait, the ball.

2951
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:31,330
Wait, I think we lost the hat.

2952
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:32,290
I think we lost the hat.

2953
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:33,570
We definitely did.

2954
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:34,510
It was my bad.

2955
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:35,550
That's fine.

2956
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,070
Everybody blame Barry Buck.

2957
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:40,170
Oh, gosh, this part is like crazy timing.

2958
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:41,310
Ah, you did it.

2959
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,070
Anonymous hate mail.

2960
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:45,670
The J Bezos at Amazon.com.

2961
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:46,530
You got it.

2962
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:49,190
J Bezos at Amazon.com.

2963
01:49:50,490 --> 01:49:52,230
Send all your hate mail there, baby.

2964
01:49:52,350 --> 01:49:56,670
It's probably like Bezos Daddy at Amazon.

2965
01:49:58,130 --> 01:49:59,050
Oh, you think so?

2966
01:49:59,110 --> 01:50:02,390
You think he has, like, it's not his, like, last, uh, first
name, last name?

2967
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,330
No, I don't think so.

2968
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:04,450
Oh.

2969
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:08,750
Honestly, yeah, that, that might make sense.

2970
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:09,010
Oh.

2971
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:10,090
Oh.

2972
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:15,130
How do I get out?

2973
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:16,990
This is a pretty serious situation.

2974
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:18,070
I'm stuck in here.

2975
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:19,930
Oh, got it.

2976
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:21,630
Oh, how do I get out of here?

2977
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:23,210
How do I get out of here?

2978
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:23,650
For real?

2979
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:24,490
Oh, my God.

2980
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:25,550
Wait, how do I get out of here?

2981
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:26,490
Are you stuck?

2982
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:26,970
Are you good?

2983
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:28,010
dog.

2984
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:28,590
Wait.

2985
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:30,690
I think you got it.

2986
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:31,430
You got it.

2987
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:31,830
You got it.

2988
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:32,370
Oh.

2989
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:34,790
Well, anyway, it's fine.

2990
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:36,690
Woo-o.

2991
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:37,830
Woo-o.

2992
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:38,590
Woo-o.

2993
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:42,310
Uh-oh.

2994
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:42,690
Uh-oh.

2995
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:47,650
I woke the beast and I got the demi and we continue onwards
and I die.

2996
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:50,490
And you'll awaken the beast and then you'll die.

2997
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:51,330
Oh, what's wrong?

2998
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:51,750
Oh, God.

2999
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:52,070
Oh, God.

Oh, God.

I know.

3022
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:11,810
Sometimes they disappear and sometimes they don't.

3023
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:12,730
Oh!

3024
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:16,430

I do need that rock.

01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:19,810
How do I get that rock, though?

Oh!

01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:43,730
Oh, that was you, not me.

3045
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:49,610
Why?

3046
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:51,110
Why does it spawn me there?

3047
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,090
Get out of here.

3048
01:52:53,650 --> 01:52:54,090
Get out of here.

3049
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:54,630
Get out of here.

3050
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:56,230
Where does this go?

3051
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:58,670
Oh, it goes into there.

3052
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:01,490
Oh.

3053
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:03,210
Oh, oh, God.

3054
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:05,310
Where am I?

3055
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:05,770
Oh, my gosh.

3056
01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:06,210
I can't.

3057
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:06,830
How do I...

3058
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:06,890
Oh, what?

3059
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:10,750
Okay.

3060
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:12,450
No, please!

3061
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:13,230
Oh, my God!

3062
01:53:13,330 --> 01:53:14,170
Why were there two?

3063
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:15,550
Oh, we're fine.

3064
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:16,850
Oh!

3065
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:17,010
Oh,

3066
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:20,440
I got all...

3067
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,420
We got all the thingies.

3068
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:22,960
Oh, we're missing, uh...

3069
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:23,080
Oh.

3070
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,520
It's right there.

3071
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:26,500
We can get this.

3072
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:27,200
Oh, oh.

3073
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:27,760
Okay.

3074
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,840
Yeah, you can get it.

3075
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:29,680
Get it.

3076
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:30,500
Yeah, you got it.

3077
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,600
Oh, oh, oh.

3078

There we go.

It was possible.

3093
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:27,100
The mission was possible.

3094
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:28,460
Yeah.

3095
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:29,480
Oh, only five.

3096
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:30,800
Only five, huh?

3097
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:31,380
Yeah.

3098
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:32,040
What the heck?

3099
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:35,320
Guys, we've gotten every single time one.

3100
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:36,040
Isn't that crazy?

3101
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:36,860
Yeah.

3102
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,940
And by every single one, I mean like, not getting them, but
that's like the same thing, you know?

3103
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:41,960
Oh, I got it.

3104
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,740
Nice, nice.

3105
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,060
And then you have to...

3106
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:46,320
Hello?

3107
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:46,980
Jump through?

3108
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,820
Oh, there we go.

3109
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,340
That's why.

01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Okay.

01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:53,640
Oh, my God.

3113
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:53,960
Wait.

3114
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:54,960
Oh, you got it.

3115
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:55,560
You got it.

3116
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:56,180
Wait, us.

3117
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,240
Okay, and then... Okay, nice, nice.

3118
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:00,660
Okay.

3119
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,640
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3120
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,400
Wait, where am I?

3121
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:05,540
Oh, this is fun.

3122
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:06,300
Oh, this is...

3123
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:07,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3124
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:09,640
Oh wait, what?

3125
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:10,680
What did I do?

3126
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:12,980
Anyways.

3127
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:14,520
Okay.

3128
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:17,700
What did I do, man?

3129
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:18,660
Bye-bye.

3130
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:19,020
Oh.

3131
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:20,160
I died.

3132
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:20,780
Oh, maybe you can.

3133
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:21,600
Ow.

3134
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:22,700
Oh, oh.

3135
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:23,960
Maybe this way?

3136
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:26,460
Um.

3137
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:28,900
You have to help?

3138
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:29,760
You have to cry?

3139
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,940
Oh, yeah, you have to cry for him.

3140
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,520
Come over here.

3141
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:35,400
I'll go, too.

3142
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:35,760
Oh.

3143
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:39,500
Okay.

3144
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:40,540
Okay, now I'll go.

3145
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,540
Well, I will.

3146
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:43,500
Push me.

3147
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:44,300
Push me.

3148
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:44,940
Push me.

3149
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:48,040
I don't think...

3150
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:49,520
Oh, and then you call it over to you.

3151
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,400
Oh, no.

3152
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,220
Yeah, there you go.

3153
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:53,080
There you go.

3154
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:53,720
What?

3155
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:54,740
Hello?

3156
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:55,620
No!

3157
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,100
Wait, where is he going?

3158
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:58,900
He hates me.

3159
01:55:59,020 --> 01:55:59,400
Hi.

3160
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:00,880
He actually hates you.

3161
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:04,540
Okay, there you go.

3162
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:04,780
There we go.

3163
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:05,580
Yeah, you got it.

3164
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:05,880
You got it.

3165
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:06,380
Yeah.

3166
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:08,020
Wait.

3167
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:10,240
Oh, there you go.

3168
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:10,400
Oh!

3169
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:11,840
Oh, nice!

3170
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:12,940
Yeah.

3171
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,660
We definitely meant for that to happen.

3172
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:16,820
Get out of here.

3173
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,440
Eat me!

3174
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,180
Eat me!

3175
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,000
Um, I don't know where this is supposed to be.

3176
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:25,140
Uh, I'm stuck.

3177
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:25,500
Wait.

3178
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:26,500
Uh-oh.

3179
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:27,080
Uh-oh.

3180
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:27,460
Uh-oh.

3181
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,420
Stop!

3182
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:29,180
Get it!

3183
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:29,680
Get it!

3184
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:30,040
Get it!

3185
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:30,200
Kill him!

3186
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:31,460
Kill his ass!

3187
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:31,740
Kill him!

3188
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:32,180
Kill him!

3189
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:32,940
Get him out of here!

3190
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:33,440
Yeah!

3191
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:35,900
I think we do have to move that out of the way.

3192
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:36,900
Oh, oops.

3193
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:37,940
Oh, there's fans there.

3194
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:38,140
Okay.

3195
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:40,420
Oh, my God.

3196
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:41,880
Oh, I go in.

3197
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:44,240
Oh, there you go.

3198
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:45,600
Oh, he's going?

3199
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:46,620
Get out of here, man.

3200
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,480
Oh, wait, what?

3201
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,580
Maybe he poops us through, I think.

3202
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,280
He poops us through.

3203
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:53,880
I think we need to get him up here.

3204
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,020
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3205
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:56,320
There you go.

3206
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:56,720
There you go.

3207
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:57,400
He's did it.

3208
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:57,960
Oh, he did it.

3209
01:56:59,000 --> 01:56:59,620
Yeah, there you go.

3210
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,000
Okay.

3211
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:01,020
Yeah.

3212
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:01,700
Get poop.

3213
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:02,420
Get poop.

3214
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:03,540
Oh, oh, oh.

3215
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:04,680
It's okay.

3216
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:05,260
Just go ahead.

3217
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:05,620
Go ahead.

3218
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,000
Go ahead.

3219
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:06,940
Okay, okay, okay.

3220
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:08,340
Oh, there's a secret.

3221
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,000
Where is it?

3222
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:11,420
Where is it?

3223
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:11,840
Where is it?

3224
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:13,320
Ah.

3225
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,460
Where could it be?

3226
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:19,380
Just go through the teleporter?

3227
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:22,580
He says it's this way.

3228
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:23,480
No.

3229
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:25,400
He says it's...

3230
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:26,620
He says it's...

3231
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:26,840
Somewhere.

3232
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,040
He says it's...

3233
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,140
I think we have to...

3234
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:29,860
Wait, hold on.

3235
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:32,220
Oh, wait.

3236
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:33,280
No, not like that.

3237
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:34,300
Not like that.

3238
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:36,340
Oh!

3239
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:37,460
What the hell?

3240
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:40,420
Oh, you have to time it because...

3241
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:40,500
Okay.

3242
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,000
Okay, so not now.

3243
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:45,640
Oh, I see when they grow back, okay.

3244
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:47,200
Ah, like that.

3245
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:47,600
Okay.

3246
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:48,440
I got you.

3247
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,260
Oh, oh, no.

3248
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:49,620
Okay.

3249
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:50,720
I'll get this first.

3250
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:51,060
Okay.

3251
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:52,340
Wait, where is this?

3252
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:52,780
Oh, no!

3253
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,140
Can you break that one at top?

3254
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:54,580
There we go.

3255
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:55,180
Yeah, I got it.

3256
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:55,940
Okay, there you go.

3257
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,700
There you go.

3258
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:56,960
There you go.

3259
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:57,140
Okay.

3260
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:58,860
Oh, where is the secret, though?

3261
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,780
Maybe here.

3262
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:00,580
Here.

3263
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:01,520
Here.

3264
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:02,600
Where?

3265
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:03,760
Subware.

3266
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:04,640
Subware.

3267
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,220
Oh, okay.

3268
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3269
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:13,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3270
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,160
Oh, damn it.

3271
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:16,100
Oh.

3272
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:16,980
You got it?

3273
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,360
Stop!

3274
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,380
Why would you do it?

3275
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,620
We weren't doing this!

3276
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:22,960
Hattie, you're sabotaging me!

3277
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:24,860
Oh my god.

3278
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,780
You broke her concentration, Hattie.

3279
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:28,480
Hattie!

3280
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:28,980
Oh, fuck.

3281
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:29,940
Oh wait, what the hell?

3282
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:30,260
I mean.

3283
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:31,180
How'd you do that?

3284
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:32,580
I don't know.

3285
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:34,960
Oh my god, please!

3286
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,860
I'm so bad at jumping.

3287
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,880
I hit my head every time.

3288
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,940
It ain't- it ain't easy being a triangle head, you guys!

3289
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:43,720
My hat!

3290
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:44,900
Oh.

3291
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,040
Please.

3292
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:49,080
Okay, well, I'm gonna- No.

3293
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:50,640
Oh, you got it.

3294
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:50,960
Nice.

3295
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:52,780
Don't lose it, though.

3296
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,420
Don't lose it.

3297
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:57,360
How did you- you toe-hold that?

3298
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:58,280
Oh.

3299
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:02,160
I was just such a toe-ho-er.

3300
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:03,140
To-ho-er.

3301
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:04,300
To-ho-er.

3302
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:04,640
Wait.

3303
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:05,940
Ah, fuck!

3304
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:06,680
No!

3305
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:07,740
No, no, no.

3306
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:08,900
Hey, hey.

3307
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:12,460
I knew that you were thinking- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no!

3308
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:12,540
No!

3309
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:14,420
Oh my god!

3310
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:16,600
You almost lost it!

3311
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:17,320
You almost!

3312
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:17,980
Ah!

3313
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:18,920
Stop.

3314
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,660
Truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth.

3315
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:23,640
Yeah, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth.

3316
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:25,640
It's brainwashed of that thing, man.

3317
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:26,560
Oh, I know, right?

3318
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:28,760
But it turns us into monsters, for real.

3319
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:29,700
Ow!

3320
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:31,160
Oh my god!

3321
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:32,640
I hate this part.

3322
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:36,540
I hate these walls.

3323
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:37,520
It's because...

3324
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,160
It's because...

3325
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:45,220
I don't know which way to put my joy pod, not joy pod, the
joystick.

3326
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:46,140
Oh, I just put it against the wall.

3327
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:48,240
Yeah, there you go, there you go, there you go.

3328
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:51,140
But it doesn't go me, you make me go up.

3329
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:53,060
It does this.

3330
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:55,420
I think I need you to launch me for this part.

3331
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,760
Okay, I need to, here, I'm just gonna die and go up there.

3332
01:59:59,320 --> 01:59:59,640
Hopefully.

3333
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:01,320
I don't, oh, there you go.

3334
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:02,000
Okay, okay.

3335
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,480
No, I think you go against that block there, there.

3336
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,520
No, yeah, but you need your double jump.

3337
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:08,860
I know.

3338
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:10,500
Oh, oh.

3339
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,520
I see what you mean.

3340
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:12,420
Okay.

3341
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:14,580
Maybe...

3342
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,200
Oh, oh, sorry.

3343
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:17,380
The hat.

3344
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,840
Go get the hat.

3345
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:19,660
Go get the hat.

3346
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:20,540
Go get the hat.

3347
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:22,080
Go get the hat.

3348
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:22,540
Oh, wait, hold on.

3349
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:23,660
Okay.

3350
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:24,360
See, that's what I'm...

3351
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:25,080
I back out.

3352
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:29,660
Okay.

3353
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:30,840
Now what?

3354
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:31,540
Now what?

3355
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:32,640
Now go and I'll grab you.

3356
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:34,400
Oh, God.

3357
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:36,660
Oh, thank you!

3358
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:37,020
Yeah.

3359
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:38,420
Mine!

3360
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:39,560
Wait, but the yard!

3361
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:41,900
We don't need the yarn!

3362
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:43,340
No!

3363
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:44,580
I wanted my gems!

3364
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:50,620
Oh, you actually know we don't need the yarn anymore because
we can't buy any of our weapons.

3365
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:52,000
Yeah, we don't.

3366
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,660
Who needs the yarn?

3367
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,500
It's for the cats anyway.

3368
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:57,580
We're people.

3369
02:00:57,940 --> 02:00:59,000
Yeah, we're not cats.

3370
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,180
I'm not, what do you think I am?

3371
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:00,680
A grandma?

3372
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:03,440
I'm not trying to sew here or crochet.

3373
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:04,860
Yeah.

3374
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,320
Yeah, we got the hat.

3375
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:08,140
We don't crochet.

3376
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:10,180
Oh my god, the air conditioner again.

3377
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:11,240
Oh, loud.

3378
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:12,840
It is.

3379
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:13,600
Where?

3380
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:15,440
I don't know if we can.

3381
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:16,500
Yeah, I think we gotta go this way.

3382
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:18,260
Okay, I'll go this way.

3383
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:19,200
And then...

3384
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,900
Wait, get off the...

3385
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:21,020
Yeah.

3386
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:21,860
Oh, wait.

3387
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,040
Wait.

3388
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:23,400
Oh, I got it.

3389
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:23,900
I got it.

3390
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:24,560
Okay.

3391
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:26,720
Damn.

3392
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:27,080
Alright.

3393
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:28,380
And then...

3394
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:29,320
Oh, wait.

3395
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,580
Get that out of here?

3396
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:30,900
Yeah.

3397
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:31,800
Put that there.

3398
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:32,500
Oh, wait.

3399
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:35,920
And then...

3400
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:38,840
Uh...

3401
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:39,240
Hmm.

3402
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:40,500
Okay.

3403
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:43,040
Does that do anything?

3404
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:43,700
No.

3405
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,200
Uh, does that do anything?

3406
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:46,260
I don't think it does.

3407
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:49,200
It gets rid of a block, but I don't think it does much else.

3408
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:52,160
Oh, we have to probably bring it over.

3409
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:53,120
Wait, don't do...

3410
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:55,500
Yeah, do this so that it goes over there.

3411
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:57,800
Oh, wait, you did.

3412
02:01:57,960 --> 02:01:58,720
Oh, you did it.

02:01:58,900 --> 02:01:59,680
Wait, what did I do?

3414
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:00,360
What does that do?

3415
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:02,400
Do I bring this up here?

3416
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:05,560
Oh, you think so?

3417
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:07,860
Wait, can I throw it?

Oh, no.

3419
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,180

That's the thing is, this is going this way, so it's
difficult to do.

3451
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,380
Did we come back here?

3452
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:38,780
Like...

3453
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:40,220
Wait, is there anything else?

3454
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:40,800
This way?

3455
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,320
Oh, wait, no, you can make it up there.

3456
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,920
You can do it.

3457
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,380
You can't put the rock there.

3458
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:48,820
Wait, oh, you can?

3459
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:50,260
Yeah, you can.

3460
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,300
How'd you do it?

3461
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:54,620
Oh, and you have to put the rock on the guy.

3462
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,260
Oh, you can throw it?

3463
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,800
Wait, how do you throw it?

3464
02:03:58,140 --> 02:03:59,660
Oh, how do you throw it?

3465
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:01,200
You just, like, the attack button?

3466
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:03,280
Attack button?

3467
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:04,780
Oh, okay, okay, I see.

3468
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:05,880
Okay, okay, wait.

3469
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,600
Now don't hold him back over.

3470
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:09,720
Wait, I was going to say...

3471
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:12,560
Okay, you got to be careful not to do like a...

3472
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:14,840
Because it'll go through.

3473
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:15,240
Ouch.

3474
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:16,320
Okay, okay, okay.

3475
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:17,620
Okay.

3476
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:18,820
So one second.

3477
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:20,560
Let me get it back up.

3478
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:21,500
Okay.

3479
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:21,940
Up there.

3480
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:23,300
What?

3481
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:27,060
How does this happen to me?

3482
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:31,520
Okay, if you can time it so the rock lands on him.

3483
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:34,380
Here, I'll do this.

3484
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:34,980
There you go.

3485
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:36,940
One second.

3486
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:38,540
You got it?

3487
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,040
You got it?

3488
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:44,000
One second?

3489
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:44,700
One second?

3490
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:45,820
You got it?

3491
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:46,140
You got it?

3492
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,020
I'm going to lift it.

3493
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:49,640
Okay.

3494
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:50,480
Lift it.

3495
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:51,140
And then...

3496
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:51,580
Okay, nice.

3497
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:52,460
Oh, nice!

3498
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:53,060
That's perfect!

3499
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:53,720
Okay, okay, okay.

3500
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:54,540
Okay, nice.

3501
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:55,060
And now...

3502
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:55,800
We do that.

3503
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:59,160
And then now we do this.

3504
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:00,140
Yes.

3505
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:02,040
And then you do that.

3506
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:02,440
That.

3507
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:04,220
All right.

3508
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:05,500
Okay, that?

3509
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:07,800
Oh, the timing is so weird.

3510
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:08,720
Okay, hold on.

3511
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:09,600
Okay.

3512
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:10,260
Yeah, nice.

3513
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:11,200
There we go.

3514
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:11,720
Let's show.

3515
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,600
Oh, come on.

3516
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:13,440
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3517
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:13,900
No, no, you're good.

3518
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:15,500
Oh, wait.

3519
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:15,860
Oh, wait.

3520
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:16,540
Yes, yes, please.

3521
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:17,820
I can't get it back on it.

3522
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:18,800
I can't get back on it.

3523
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,340
Oh, you're just fine.

3524
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:21,760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3525
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:21,880
Okay.

3526
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:22,220
It's okay.

3527
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:22,760
We know what to do.

3528
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:23,240
We know what to do.

3529
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:23,680
Okay, go.

3530
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:25,160
Okay.

3531
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:26,320
Okay.

3532
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,900
And then that's this.

3533
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,280
And then that's...

3534
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:30,700
That's okay.

3535
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:30,940
All right.

3536
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:34,680
Oh, how do we do this first time?

3537
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:35,200
It's...

3538
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,000
There's like a timing to bring back the...

3539
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,500
Oh, there we go.

3540
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:37,780
There we go.

3541
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:38,080
There we go.

3542
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:38,820
Okay.

3543
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,040
Okay, nice.

3544
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:41,040
Yay!

3545
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:41,680
Yay!

3546
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:42,360
There we go!

3547
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:44,060
Okay!

3548
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:44,700
Okay!

3549
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:45,480
Oh my gosh.

3550
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,500
Oh my god, my brain hurts.

3551
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:48,140
I know.

3552
02:05:49,580 --> 02:05:50,160
My brain.

3553
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:51,380
Okay, what is...

3554
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:53,560
These are these batteries that we like can grab.

3555
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:54,900
Or we have to like...

3556
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:55,420
Oh, we can grab them?

3557
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:57,240
Or no, we have to make them all the same.

3558
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:58,420
You gotta equal them, yeah.

3559
02:05:58,580 --> 02:05:58,840
Yeah.

3560
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:00,720
Yeah.

3561
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:03,840
Okay.

3562
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:05,800
Got it.

3563
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:06,440
There you go.

3564
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:07,400
All right.

3565
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:09,020
Can I go?

3566
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:10,300
Okay.

3567
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:11,060
Okay.

3568
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:11,440
Good.

3569
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:12,020
Oop.

3570
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:13,560
Nice.

3571
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:15,220
Oop.

3572
02:06:15,860 --> 02:06:16,980
Oh, I was too early.

3573
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:17,280
Sorry.

3574
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,100
I thought we timed that.

3575
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:19,460
Okay.

3576
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:24,000
You gotta be a little bit.

3577
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:24,480
Yeah, there you go.

3578
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:24,860
There you go.

3579
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:25,860
Thank you.

3580
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:26,140
Thank you.

3581
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:27,160
Thank you.

3582
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:27,280
No.

3583
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:31,520
Okay.

3584
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:33,020
Good to know.

3585
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:33,320
Okay.

3586
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:33,460
Good to know.

3587
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,020
Go, go, go.

3588
02:06:34,580 --> 02:06:35,180
I'm going.

3589
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:37,180
Okay, alright.

3590
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:38,680
Oh.

3591
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,820
Let me wait for it to...

3592
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,860
Okay, there you go.

3593
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:44,440
There you go.

3594
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:44,580
There you go.

3595
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,060
Okay, it's gonna happen again.

3596
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:46,460
Oh!

3597
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:48,660
I always do that.

3598
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:50,100
Wait, but it didn't like attack.

3599
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:51,160
Oh, it does kill you.

3600
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:54,000
Yeah, it does kill you for like a second.

3601
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:55,600
Alright.

3602
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:56,760
I'll stand on it.

3603
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:57,820
Oh, oh, oh.

3604
02:06:57,920 --> 02:06:58,600
Oh, you stand on it.

3605
02:06:58,600 --> 02:06:59,380
Okay, you will stand on it.

3606
02:06:59,820 --> 02:06:59,820
Okay.

3607
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:00,820
Oh.

3608
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:02,320
Oh, oh, oh.

3609
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:03,020
Oh my god.

3610
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:06,300
Wait, that timing is so Oh, okay, okay.

3611
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:06,640
Is good?

3612
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:07,540
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

3613
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:08,900
Okay, alright, let it go.

3614
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:09,560
Okay, after this?

3615
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:13,780
Okay, there we go.

3616
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:15,120
Oh.

3617
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:19,820
Okay, nice, uh oh, oh.

3618
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:20,700
Okay, cool.

3619
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:21,060
Perfect.

3620
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:22,560
Whoa, whoa.

3621
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:23,840
Oh, oh, oh.

3622
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:24,400
Aw, oh, oh.

3623
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:27,620
Oh, nice!

3624
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:29,640
Duh, not nice.

3625
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:32,140
Oh, oh, whoa, what's going on here?

3626
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:32,900
Hello.

3627
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:36,020
What is going on over there?

3628
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:37,520
A lot of stuff.

3629
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,220
Oh my god.

3630
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:39,960
Oh my god.

3631
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:40,500
Wait a second.

3632
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:41,380
This is insanity.

3633
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:43,360
Oh.

3634
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:44,260
Oh.

3635
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:44,800
Oh.

3636
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:45,620
You did it.

3637
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:47,820
Oh god.

3638
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,340
Oh god.

3639
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:48,660
Oh god.

3640
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:49,000
Okay.

3641
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:49,480
Thank you.

3642
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:49,820
Thank you.

3643
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:50,120
Okay.

3644
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:50,640
That's good.

3645
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:51,300
Ah.

3646
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:51,900
Well, thank y'all.

3647
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:52,380
Okay.

3648
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:53,480
Oh my god.

3649
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:54,160
Okay.

3650
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:54,660
Oh god.

3651
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:55,760
It's so loud.

3652
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:56,860
Okay.

3653
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:58,780
Are you good maybe?

3654
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:01,880
No!

3655
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:03,920
Where's that going?

3656
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,260
Oh, I need you to step on this, though.

3657
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:07,700
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3658
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:09,080
Hold on.

3659
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:14,460
Okay.

3660
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:15,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3661
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:16,940
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3662
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:17,360
Okay, okay.

3663
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:17,980
Oh, wait, what the heck?

3664
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:18,520
There's a secret.

3665
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:18,980
What is that?

3666
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:19,880
Go in there, go in there.

3667
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:21,520
Hey, that's it.

3668
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:22,460
There's no more.

3669
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:24,380
I think you probably might have gotten it.

3670
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:25,060
Did I?

3671
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:26,240
Okay, I'm stepping.

3672
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:28,080
Yeah, I think you got it when you came in.

3673
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:29,120
Okay.

3674
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:30,140
Oh, dang it.

3675
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:30,800
Okay, hold on.

3676
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:31,540
It's okay, it's okay.

3677
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:35,420
All right.

3678
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:35,860
All right.

3679
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:37,460
Okay.

3680
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:39,840
Uh...

3681
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:42,180
And you have to...

3682
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:43,900
I think I have to step on this.

3683
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:44,480
Yeah.

3684
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:46,100
Okay.

3685
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:47,240
Oh, oh, oh.

3686
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:48,180
Oh, nice, nice.

3687
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:50,020
Uh...

3688
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:51,080
What's this block?

3689
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:51,740
Okay, can I drop?

3690
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:52,640
Ah!

3691
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:53,680
Okay, I'm gonna...

3692
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,140
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3693
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:55,940
We're fine, we're fine.

3694
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:56,700
Oh, no!

3695
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:58,420
Oh, no, no, no, we're good, we're good, we're good.

3696
02:08:58,680 --> 02:08:59,020
Okay, okay.

3697
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:01,340
Okay, what do I step on to...

3698
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:01,840
Okay, there you go.

3699
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:02,160
Okay, that one.

3700
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:04,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not through.

3701
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:05,200
I'm not through.

3702
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:05,880
There we go.

3703
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:07,220
Nice, nice, nice.

3704
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:08,140
Okay.

3705
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:10,780
And then...

3706
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:11,580
Nice, okay.

3707
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:12,480
This one.

3708
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:13,920
Okay!

3709
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:15,460
All right, all right, all right.

3710
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,140
Oh, that's gonna start exploding.

3711
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,300
Oh my god, it's so loud.

3712
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:22,540

02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:36,360
What do we do here?

3721
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:40,020
Oh, we have to bring that, I think, yeah.

3722
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:41,940
Uh, okay.

3723
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:42,980
You can do that.

3724
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:44,620
You can do it.

3725
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:45,060
Hold on.

3726
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:46,120
I'm doing it.

3727
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:47,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3728
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:48,680
Oh.

3729
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:55,200
A lure, please.

3730
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Oh, oh, oh, no!

3731
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:58,440
I died.

3732
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:00,100
Yes, yes, yes.

3733
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:01,120

Okay.

3736
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:04,040
Very good, very good.

3737
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:05,280
Okay, okay, okay.

3738
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3739
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:09,160
Oh, nice, nice.

3740
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:10,400
Okay, that must be it, right?

3741
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:11,480
Oh, wait.

3742
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:12,880
Oh, you need my head.

3743
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:13,980
There you go.

3744
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:16,540
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3745
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:17,740
You did that.

3746
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:18,140
Okay.

3747
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,360
No, I didn't.

3748
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:20,140
Grab me up.

3749
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:21,000
No, no, no.

3750
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:23,300
Okay, thank you.

Oh, no, I would.

3753

Ah!

3754
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:32,980
If it falls in the lava, it falls in real life, very bad.

3755
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:42,230
You've had the hat.

3756
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:43,390
You've had the hat.

3757
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:46,230
What if I want the hat more?

3758
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:47,290
Do I throw you in there?

3759
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:47,930
Oh, oh!

3760
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:49,390
That's it.

3761
02:10:49,590 --> 02:10:50,570
Now nobody gets the hat.

3762
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:51,330
Are you happy?

3763
02:10:51,730 --> 02:10:52,370
Are you happy?

3764
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:54,450

Why didn't we?

3766
02:10:55,410 --> 02:10:55,910
That was a B.

3767
02:10:56,110 --> 02:10:57,430

3768
02:10:59,490 --> 02:11:00,310
Well, here you go.

Oh, wait.

3771
02:11:04,630 --> 02:11:05,710
This guy's gonna explode.

3772
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:07,410

We didn't get that.

3784
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:44,210
We didn't get the hat but we got the yarn.

3785
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:45,230
We did get the yarn.

3786

Yeah.

I can't time it.

3798
02:12:05,010 --> 02:12:05,650
I'm scared.

3799
02:12:05,970 --> 02:12:06,290

3844
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:56,530
I know you can make it, though.

3845
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:58,210
Whatever you decide.

3846
02:12:58,430 --> 02:12:58,810
However...

02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:33,000
How do I do this?

4006
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:34,760
How do you?

4007
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,000
Oh, that's not it.

4008
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:37,500
Oh, I use this block.

4009
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:39,420
Oh, maybe not.

4010
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:43,940
Oh, and then I probably get off of it once I go through.

4011
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:44,860
Yeah.

4012
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:46,760
Oh, sorry, my timing.

4013
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:49,500
My timing, my timing.

4014
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:52,360
Let me know.

4015
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:53,640
No!

4016
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:54,560
It's really...

4017
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:56,380
It's tough, though, because you're going so fast.

4018
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:57,800
Oh, yeah.

4019
02:17:58,840 --> 02:17:59,240
Okay.

4020
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:00,440
Oh, oops.

4021
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:01,060
That was my bad.

4022
02:18:01,220 --> 02:18:02,160
I didn't mean to touch it.

4023
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,880
Please, Debbie up.

4024
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:08,600
Okay.

4025
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:14,900
Go get it!

4026
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:16,640
Oh, you're nice.

4027
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:20,320
You're fine, you've hit it.

4028
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:21,160
Yeah, we're good.

4029
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:21,740
Yeah.

4030
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:23,260
Oh, damn.

4031
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:24,200
Oh, there's a yarn.

4032
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,980
There's a yarn up there.

4033
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:27,120
There's about that.

4034
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:28,740
Oh, wee!

4035
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,080
Oh, nice save.

4036
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:32,020
Oh!

4037
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:33,820
Okay, we're good, we're good.

4038
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:37,760
She games like no one's over here.

4039
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:40,040
Oh, shoot.

4040
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:41,280
Ah!

4041
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:42,300
Ah!

4042
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:42,320
Ah!

4043
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:42,560
Ah!

4044
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:43,760
Ah!

4045
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:46,720
Oh, this is the exit.

4046
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:48,440
Oh, you have to, like, flappy bird this again.

4047
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,740
Oh, oh, my bad.

4048
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,900
Hold on, I want to flappy bird.

4049
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:55,220
Flappy bird.

4050
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:56,860
Oh, okay.

4051
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:58,660
I guess I could do it like that.

4052
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,520
What did you even do?

4053
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:02,820
Like that.

4054
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:10,950
What the hell?

4055
02:19:12,710 --> 02:19:13,050
Okay.

4056
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:13,870
Flappy bird.

4057
02:19:14,490 --> 02:19:15,270
Flappy bird.

4058
02:19:18,090 --> 02:19:19,510
Flappy Bird, Flappy Bird!

4059
02:19:21,410 --> 02:19:21,830
Alright.

4060
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:27,250
I don't uninstall Flappy Bird on your phone.

4061
02:19:27,390 --> 02:19:29,290
There's no way to get it back.

4062
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:31,530
You can get it back.

4063
02:19:31,630 --> 02:19:32,630
Oh, watch out.

4064
02:19:33,930 --> 02:19:36,770

You're welcome.

4090
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:36,550
How did you die?

4091
02:20:37,650 --> 02:20:39,030
I don't want to talk about it.

4092
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:42,870
That's fine.

4093
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:46,710
Oh, what happened to me?

4094
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:47,830

You died, did.

4098
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:53,190
I don't remember dying.

4099
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:57,730
You don't remember dying to this?

4100
02:20:58,770 --> 02:20:59,010
No.

4101
02:20:59,010 --> 02:21:00,890

Oh, where I am now?

02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:06,110

Oh, no.

Oh, there we go.

Same thing happened to me!

02:21:21,970 --> 02:21:23,670
Hey, we're here!

4114
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:24,190
Alright.

4115
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:28,150
Okay.

Wait, oh, do I need you?

02:21:33,850 --> 02:21:34,670
Well, keep going.

4119
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:36,370
Keep going.

4120
02:21:36,810 --> 02:21:36,850
Oh!

4121
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:40,790
Alright, use my head.

4122
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:41,190
Oh.

4123
02:21:41,670 --> 02:21:41,930
Okay.

4124
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:43,130
Oh.

4125
02:21:43,730 --> 02:21:45,530
Go, go, go up.

4126
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:46,510
Oh, there you go.

4127
02:21:46,530 --> 02:21:48,430
Go, go, yeah, okay, nice.

02:21:49,330 --> 02:21:49,650
Oh!

4129
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:50,710
Whoa!

4130
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:53,110
Oh, you're stuck in there.

4131
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:57,290
All right, use my hand.

4132
02:21:58,390 --> 02:21:58,670
Okay.

4133
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:01,530
Oh, wait, I do that.

4134
02:22:02,670 --> 02:22:03,070
Nice.

4135
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:06,250
Just die, yeah, just die.

4136
02:22:08,550 --> 02:22:09,030
There you go.

4137
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:10,050
There you go.

4138
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:11,230
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4139
02:22:11,430 --> 02:22:11,990
You jump?

4140
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:12,890
Okay, there you go.

4141
02:22:12,910 --> 02:22:13,710
Oh, wait, hold on.

4142
02:22:13,790 --> 02:22:14,070
Yep.

4143
02:22:15,050 --> 02:22:16,270
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

4144
02:22:17,650 --> 02:22:19,570
Okay, there you go, there you go.

4145
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:22,450
Wait, oh, I don't think I still need...

4146
02:22:22,450 --> 02:22:23,190
Okay, there you go.

4147
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:24,910
Oh, you got- Oh, no!

4148
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:26,310
Just stay there.

4149
02:22:26,570 --> 02:22:26,730
Oh.

4150
02:22:27,930 --> 02:22:29,430
Uh, uh, oh.

4151
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:29,850
Oh, oh, oh.

4152
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:31,090
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

4153
02:22:31,330 --> 02:22:31,470
Okay.

4154
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:35,810
I'm telling, my timing is really bad.

4155
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,410
Okay.

4156
02:22:38,490 --> 02:22:38,850
Ah!

4157
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:40,890
Just, uh, one more time.

4158
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:41,350
One more time.

4159
02:22:41,710 --> 02:22:42,330
I'm gonna do that.

4160
02:22:42,410 --> 02:22:42,750
Okay, yeah.

4161
02:22:43,050 --> 02:22:43,370
Oh.

4162
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:45,990
Okay, there you go.

4163
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:46,170
Oh.

4164
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:48,430
Oh, oh.

4165
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:51,610
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4166
02:22:51,690 --> 02:22:52,170
Okay, you're good.

4167
02:22:52,910 --> 02:22:53,930
You just gotta come over here.

4168
02:22:54,830 --> 02:22:55,110
Yeah.

4169
02:22:55,490 --> 02:22:55,850
Oh.

4170
02:22:59,410 --> 02:23:01,090
I think I ran out of steam.

4171
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:02,890
Oh, oh.

4172
02:23:03,050 --> 02:23:04,610
Yeah, you have to keep pressing it, I think.

4173
02:23:06,250 --> 02:23:06,870
Oh, nice.

4174
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:07,650
Oh, nice.

4175
02:23:07,850 --> 02:23:08,110
Oh, no.

4176
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:11,030
Right at the very end.

4177
02:23:11,050 --> 02:23:12,230
Right at the very end.

4178
02:23:12,410 --> 02:23:12,870
Uh-oh.

4179
02:23:14,330 --> 02:23:16,970
Oh, this is the real Flappy Bird experience, I think.

4180
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:17,970
This really is.

4181
02:23:19,450 --> 02:23:19,690
No!

4182
02:23:20,030 --> 02:23:21,310
Oh, the freaking lava!

4183
02:23:23,650 --> 02:23:24,970
Oh my god, please, please, please!

4184
02:23:26,570 --> 02:23:27,690
Oh, she is.

4185
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:28,810
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

4186
02:23:28,950 --> 02:23:30,930
Oh, I'm just not a Flappy Birder.

4187
02:23:31,050 --> 02:23:31,550
Me neither.

4188
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:34,410
I just ran straight.

4189
02:23:34,930 --> 02:23:35,850
Damn it, yeah.

4190
02:23:37,990 --> 02:23:38,390
Okay.

4191
02:23:40,430 --> 02:23:40,830
What?

4192
02:23:41,830 --> 02:23:42,750
Oh my god, please.

4193
02:23:42,770 --> 02:23:43,770
I guess you can't spam it.

4194
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:46,210
I was right there!

4195
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:48,230
I overestimated it.

4196
02:23:48,230 --> 02:23:49,010
Ah no!

4197
02:23:49,970 --> 02:23:50,410
What the?

4198
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:51,390
Why am I back here?

4199
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:53,710
Sorry, that was so funny.

4200
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:55,370
I got to... Wait, me too!

4201
02:23:55,930 --> 02:23:58,490
Ah, see ya chub!

4202
02:23:58,870 --> 02:24:02,390
Oh my god.

4203
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:04,030
Oh my god, oh my god, no!

4204
02:24:04,450 --> 02:24:07,250
Wait, I don't understand how to control this thing at all, I
think.

4205
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:08,350
I'm so confused.

4206
02:24:09,710 --> 02:24:11,670
Okay, one, and then...

4207
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:12,090
Oh fuck.

4208
02:24:13,790 --> 02:24:14,270
Oh my god!

4209
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:17,870
Okay.

4210
02:24:19,410 --> 02:24:19,750
No!

4211
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:20,950
Why did it run out?

4212
02:24:21,890 --> 02:24:22,150
Why?

4213
02:24:23,830 --> 02:24:24,750
Oh my god!

4214
02:24:25,550 --> 02:24:26,950
Oh my god!

4215
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:26,990
Oh my god!

4216
02:24:26,990 --> 02:24:27,910
I ran right into it!

4217
02:24:27,930 --> 02:24:28,870
Oh go to Flappy Bird.

4218
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:30,630
We're stupid you guys.

4219
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:31,550
We're stupid.

4220
02:24:32,310 --> 02:24:32,710
Oh my god.

4221
02:24:32,990 --> 02:24:34,070
Sometimes it runs out and sometimes it doesn't.

4222
02:24:34,070 --> 02:24:34,590
Sometimes it...

4223
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:35,630
I know it's kind of random.

4224
02:24:36,310 --> 02:24:36,950
I'm like...

4225
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:37,750
Oh, nope, nope.

4226
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:40,130
Ah, trick!

4227
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:41,630
No!

4228
02:24:42,770 --> 02:24:43,330
Why?

4229
02:24:43,610 --> 02:24:43,690
Why?

4230
02:24:43,690 --> 02:24:43,750
Why?

4231
02:24:43,790 --> 02:24:45,790
so that I can...

4232
02:24:46,930 --> 02:24:47,730
Oh, dang it.

4233
02:24:48,310 --> 02:24:49,210
Oh, damn it.

4234
02:24:49,670 --> 02:24:53,030
Oh my god, this is gonna be one hour of this dissection.

4235
02:24:53,830 --> 02:24:54,210
Oh!

4236
02:24:55,190 --> 02:24:57,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4237
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:00,790
You got it, oh!

4238
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:01,510
You got it!

4239
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:02,650
You got it, you got it.

4240
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:03,730
Oh, hello?

4241
02:25:04,210 --> 02:25:04,930
Just keep going.

4242
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:05,890
I'll catch up.

4243
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:06,990
Oh, I don't think I can.

4244
02:25:07,350 --> 02:25:07,610
Oh.

4245
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:10,050
I need you to make it.

4246
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:10,710
You need me!

4247
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:11,370
I need you.

4248
02:25:11,470 --> 02:25:12,290
I need my needle.

4249
02:25:12,530 --> 02:25:13,050
Oh my god.

4250
02:25:13,790 --> 02:25:14,050
Shoot me!

4251
02:25:14,090 --> 02:25:15,610
Oh, because the thing is up there, I see.

4252
02:25:17,290 --> 02:25:18,090
Oh my god.

4253
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:21,450
Oh, there you go, there you go.

4254
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:22,750
Yippee!

4255
02:25:23,490 --> 02:25:24,290
Come here.

4256
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:26,890
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, be careful.

4257
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:32,070
Be really careful.

4258
02:25:32,930 --> 02:25:33,670
Yeah, I'll be careful.

4259
02:25:34,830 --> 02:25:35,470
Oh, hello.

4260
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:39,190
A monkey over here.

4261
02:25:40,770 --> 02:25:41,130
Ah!

4262
02:25:46,330 --> 02:25:47,670
Oh, I need you.

4263
02:25:48,230 --> 02:25:48,730
I need you.

4264
02:25:49,170 --> 02:25:49,350
Oh.

4265
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:49,990
Oh.

4266
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:50,590
Oh, sorry.

4267
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:50,910
Bye-bye.

4268
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:52,330
There you go.

4269
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:54,090
Now I need you.

4270
02:25:54,970 --> 02:25:55,010
Oh.

4271
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:57,710
I need you to fly.

4272
02:25:57,830 --> 02:25:59,570
I can't fly this plane without you.

4273
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:02,230
I will be your co-pilot.

4274
02:26:02,430 --> 02:26:03,150
Don't you worry.

4275
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:04,070
There you go.

4276
02:26:04,210 --> 02:26:04,610
Oh, there you go.

4277
02:26:04,730 --> 02:26:05,270
Okay, there we go.

4278
02:26:05,490 --> 02:26:05,930
Okay, okay.

4279
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:06,950
Oh, okay.

4280
02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:07,810
Okay, I think.

4281
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,710
Oh, there you go.

4282
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:09,210
Okay.

4283
02:26:09,270 --> 02:26:09,950
It worked out.

4284
02:26:10,110 --> 02:26:10,510
Oh.

4285
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:15,990
Oh, oh, I see.

4286
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:16,710
Where does this do?

4287
02:26:20,290 --> 02:26:21,950
Oh, oh, wow.

4288
02:26:22,110 --> 02:26:23,010
That's a lot going on.

4289
02:26:23,130 --> 02:26:23,590
Oh, I see.

4290
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:24,010
I see.

4291
02:26:24,910 --> 02:26:26,990
Oh, I think I have to...

4292
02:26:26,990 --> 02:26:29,030
I think we have to...

4293
02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:31,110
Get that up there?

4294
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:32,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4295
02:26:32,810 --> 02:26:33,230
There you go.

4296
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:34,010
Oh, shoot.

4297
02:26:35,330 --> 02:26:35,850
Oh, yeah.

4298
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:36,830
Okay.

4299
02:26:37,910 --> 02:26:39,310
Yeah, to put on that block.

4300
02:26:39,790 --> 02:26:41,170
Oh, you almost got it.

4301
02:26:42,430 --> 02:26:43,050
Oh, shoot.

4302
02:26:43,450 --> 02:26:43,630
Okay.

4303
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:44,990
Yeah, go.

4304
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:47,270
Okay.

4305
02:26:47,530 --> 02:26:47,850
Oh, shoot.

4306
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:49,250
Oh!

4307
02:26:52,910 --> 02:26:53,170
Oh!

4308
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:53,430
Oh!

4309
02:26:53,470 --> 02:26:53,790
Oh, it's closer!

4310
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:54,510
So close?

4311
02:26:55,650 --> 02:26:56,090
Oh my god.

4312
02:26:56,590 --> 02:26:56,830
What?

4313
02:26:56,930 --> 02:26:57,550
Oh my goodness.

4314
02:26:58,190 --> 02:26:58,590
Oh!

4315
02:26:59,810 --> 02:27:00,210
Oh!

4316
02:27:01,130 --> 02:27:03,590
Why is the place where it puts you is random?

4317
02:27:04,470 --> 02:27:04,870
Oh.

4318
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:06,970
Oh.

4319
02:27:07,390 --> 02:27:07,550
Oh.

4320
02:27:07,550 --> 02:27:07,810
Oh, sorry.

4321
02:27:08,010 --> 02:27:08,470
No, you're dead.

4322
02:27:08,890 --> 02:27:10,670
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe I just go there.

4323
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:12,410
Here, I'll just do this.

4324
02:27:12,570 --> 02:27:12,830
Okay.

4325
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:13,830
This might be easier.

4326
02:27:14,370 --> 02:27:14,610
Yeah.

4327
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:15,930
Okay.

4328
02:27:16,330 --> 02:27:19,070
So then, but I still can't do it much.

4329
02:27:19,070 --> 02:27:19,890
No, the lava.

4330
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:20,630
Yeah, there you go.

4331
02:27:21,390 --> 02:27:21,790
Okay.

4332
02:27:23,730 --> 02:27:24,370
Oh, okay.

4333
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:25,230
That's fine.

4334
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:26,810
Oh, that's a fine place to put me.

4335
02:27:28,050 --> 02:27:28,490
All right.

4336
02:27:29,550 --> 02:27:30,130
All right.

4337
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:31,490
Oh, I got it.

4338
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:31,850
Oh, you got one.

4339
02:27:31,910 --> 02:27:32,230
You got one.

4340
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:32,710
You got one.

4341
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:33,390
All right.

4342
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:34,030
Hold on though.

4343
02:27:34,490 --> 02:27:35,450
Let me do it again.

4344
02:27:37,790 --> 02:27:38,190
Okay.

4345
02:27:38,390 --> 02:27:38,910
Okay, nice.

4346
02:27:39,150 --> 02:27:40,330
Wait, I'm at the exit though.

4347
02:27:41,610 --> 02:27:42,310
That's true.

4348
02:27:43,290 --> 02:27:44,930
I don't know how to get you over.

4349
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:47,330
Oh, I think you put it back up.

4350
02:27:47,370 --> 02:27:47,830
Wait, no.

4351
02:27:48,270 --> 02:27:49,710
I don't...

4352
02:27:49,710 --> 02:27:50,230
Oh, hello.

4353
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:51,270
Okay, I'm gonna...

4354
02:27:51,270 --> 02:27:52,130
I'm gonna go...

4355
02:27:52,810 --> 02:27:53,390
Get it!

4356
02:27:53,610 --> 02:27:54,030
Get it!

4357
02:27:58,020 --> 02:27:58,920
That was all of them!

4358
02:27:59,100 --> 02:27:59,340
I think?

4359
02:27:59,520 --> 02:27:59,720
Maybe?

4360
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:00,700
Yeah, it was.

4361
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:01,960
The shiny.

4362
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:03,280
Okay, okay.

4363
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:03,300
Yeah.

4364
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,160
But we didn't...

4365
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:07,420
Who cares about it?

4366
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:09,620
Who cares about the ball?

4367
02:28:14,210 --> 02:28:14,850
We got it.

4368
02:28:14,930 --> 02:28:15,790
We got it.

4369
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:18,510

Yeah, we did.

02:28:19,630 --> 02:28:20,510
We made that look so...

4372
02:28:20,510 --> 02:28:21,510
All right, the final stretch.

4373
02:28:21,670 --> 02:28:21,890

02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:16,440
Alright, I will launch you.

4388
02:29:17,320 --> 02:29:18,500
Okay, okay, you launched me.

4389
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:20,460
Oh, sorry, that was my bad.

4390
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:22,480
I wasn't close enough to the edge.

4391
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:24,380
Okay.

4392
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:33,240
Okay, okay, you just get ready to launch.

4393
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,640
Okay, I'll be here.

4394
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:35,560
Okay.

4395
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,900
Oh, I'm launching you?

4396
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:39,520
Oh, I'll launch you.

4397
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:40,020
Okay, go!

4398
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,580
Oh my god, I was so close!

4399
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:43,640
I was holding R&D!

4400
02:29:43,660 --> 02:29:44,240
It was close, it was close.

4401
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:45,220
It was so good, it's good.

4402
02:29:48,460 --> 02:29:49,300
Okay, okay.

4403
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:50,880
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.

4404
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:52,940
I wasn't...

4405
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:53,220
Go!

4406
02:29:54,480 --> 02:29:54,840
Go!

4407
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:55,140
Go!

4408
02:29:55,140 --> 02:29:55,420
Nice!

4409
02:29:55,580 --> 02:29:55,840
Nice!

4410
02:29:56,020 --> 02:29:56,360
Okay!

4411
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:57,020
Okay, nice.

4412
02:29:58,580 --> 02:29:58,920
Um...

4413
02:29:59,640 --> 02:29:59,980
Um...

4414
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:01,460
I think you want to...

4415
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:04,060
Yeah, no, I don't think you need to do that.

4416
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:05,040
I think you need to...

4417
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:07,580
You want to get the blocks out of the way.

4418
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:08,360
I think so, too.

4419
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:09,140
All right, here we go.

4420
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:09,980
Yeah, all right.

4421
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:13,120
Nice.

4422
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:13,900
Oh, okay, okay.

4423
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:15,240
Oh, no.

4424
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:17,200
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4425
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:18,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4426
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:19,060
Oh, nice.

4427
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:19,840
So close.

4428
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:20,840
All right.

4429
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:21,380
That was close.

4430
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:22,080
Oh, shoot.

4431
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:22,640
Oh, shoot.

4432
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:23,820
That would have been bad.

4433
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:24,580
Don't die.

4434
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:24,920
Don't die.

4435
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:25,880
Okay, everyone die.

4436
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:33,520
It's okay.

4437
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,100
We did it, though.

4438
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:40,580
Run!

4439
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:41,720
Come here, Minto!

4440
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:43,040
Oh, no!

4441
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:49,520
Oh, wait, hold on.

4442
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,340
Oh, okay, there you go.

4443
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:53,480
Okay.

4444
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:57,100
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!

4445
02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:59,500
Nice, okay, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4446
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:00,280
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4447
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:01,240
Okay, now what?

4448
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:02,180
I'm gonna go.

4449
02:31:02,380 --> 02:31:04,320
I guess we just avoid...

4450
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:05,220
What's this at the end?

4451
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:06,220
Yeah, what's that at the end?

4452
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:07,700
I don't know.

4453
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:09,420
Oh, oh, it gives us a...

4454
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:11,840
Oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna die.

4455
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:14,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, we both died.

4456
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:17,180
Okay.

4457
02:31:17,820 --> 02:31:18,420
There we go.

4458
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:18,900
There you go.

4459
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:21,760
Oh, we just need it again.

4460
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:22,280
Yeah.

4461
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:24,520
Oh, nice.

4462
02:31:24,660 --> 02:31:25,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4463
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:26,060
What the hell?

4464
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:28,540
It disappeared for, like, so fast.

4465
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:30,340
Yeah, it's...

4466
02:31:30,340 --> 02:31:31,360
It's pretty fast.

4467
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,100
Okay, we're good.

4468
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:32,660
We're good.

4469
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:32,760
Oh, we're fine.

4470
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:33,540
I haven't think it's good.

4471
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:33,680
Oh, God.

4472
02:31:33,820 --> 02:31:34,580
What is this?

4473
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:39,000
Just go.

4474
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:40,940
Don't die.

4475
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:42,560
Don't die.

4476
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:43,440
Don't die.

4477
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:44,700
Don't die.

4478
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:44,880
Don't die.

4479
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:45,280
Oh, my God.

4480
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:45,760
So close.

4481
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:48,700
Oh, no.

4482
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:49,880
I

4483
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:55,320
got it.

4484
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:55,600
Nice.

4485
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,100
Wait, this part, though.

4486
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:58,920
Oh, God, oh, God.

4487
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:03,580
I went so fast.

4488
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:05,020
I didn't even...

4489
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:05,220
Oh.

4490
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:06,800
Sorry, I think I killed you there.

4491
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:07,800
I think that was me.

4492
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:09,400
I killed you.

4493
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,200
Oh, no, I'm good.

4494
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:14,120
Exit open.

4495
02:32:14,300 --> 02:32:16,120
Oh, man, I have to do that all over again.

4496
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:16,860
No way.

4497
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:17,980
I'm going to come to you.

4498
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:20,400
If I go over here, I'm going to go.

4499
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:21,860
You have to grab that.

4500
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:23,100
Oh, and then you have to grab the block.

4501
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:26,660
Go ahead.

4502
02:32:27,740 --> 02:32:28,540
I got it.

4503
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:29,700
Nice, nice.

4504
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:30,460
And then just stretch.

4505
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:31,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4506
02:32:32,600 --> 02:32:33,660
Oh, that's good.

4507
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:34,700
Good job, good job.

4508
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:36,680
Wait, I think if you...

4509
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:38,580
Oh, there's a thing up there that you could hold.

4510
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:40,700
Okay.

4511
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:42,340
I guess maybe that was...

4512
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:43,340
Okay.

4513
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:45,600
Now what?

4514
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:47,560
Okay.

4515
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:47,820
Oh, no.

4516
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:50,700
Oh, why did I do that?

4517
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:51,560
Don't laugh.

4518
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:53,920
Okay.

4519
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:55,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4520
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:57,560
You're a little monkey.

4521
02:32:57,740 --> 02:32:58,680
You're a little monkey.

4522
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:00,080
I'm a little monkey.

4523
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:03,280
Um...

There we go.

4539
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:52,580
Oh, you didn't need to get launched.

4540
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:53,300
Oh, there you go.

Use my body.

Use my body.

4549
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:03,540
I'll use your body.

4550
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:04,480
How was that?

4551
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:06,560
Use my body.

02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:07,120
Yeah, okay.

Yes, yes!

4555
02:34:11,260 --> 02:34:11,500
Yes!

4556
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:13,820
Oh, well, that's not good.

4557
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:14,980
Oh, oh, no.

4558
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:15,960
That's not what.

4559
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:17,300
Wait, how the hell?

4560
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:17,840
Oh my gosh.

4561
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,380
It's like the...

4562
02:34:18,380 --> 02:34:20,800
Maybe, maybe, maybe you have to...

4563
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:22,340
It has to be there for a little bit.

4564
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:26,400
Oh my god, wait.

4565
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:27,140
Oh, oh, oh.

4566
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:27,600
The slimy.

4567
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:29,160
It is so nasty.

4568
02:34:29,660 --> 02:34:30,500
Wait, I'm stuck.

4569
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:32,000

02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:32,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4571

4577
02:34:36,900 --> 02:34:37,280

4588
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:48,700

4589
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:51,380

4590
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:53,300

02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:54,980
Huh.

4592
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:57,040
Is there a secret here?

4593
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:57,580
No.

4594
02:34:58,560 --> 02:34:59,480
Uh, move it away?

4595
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:00,260

4596
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:00,740
Yeah.

4597
02:35:01,340 --> 02:35:02,360
And then punch him.

4598
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:03,260
And then Mr. Kappa?

4599
02:35:03,420 --> 02:35:03,780
Oh, sorry.

4600
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:04,320

02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:06,520
Oh, dang, there's a thing.

02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:07,840
Wait, where is he going?

4603
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:10,980
Where is he going?

4604
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:13,860
Where is he going?

4605
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:15,700
Where is he going?

4606
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:18,220

02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:19,340
Where is he going?

4608
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:19,880
Where is he going?

4609
02:35:21,700 --> 02:35:23,520
Do we have to, like, direct him?

4610
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:24,060
Oh, no.

4611
02:35:25,580 --> 02:35:26,660

02:35:26,660 --> 02:35:27,460
Where did he go?

4613
02:35:27,580 --> 02:35:29,020
I guess we have to, like, block him off?

4614
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:31,660
And bloom in the battle block theater.

4615
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:33,540

Yeah, yeah.

4651
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:42,500
Oh, he's gonna die.

4652
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:43,000
It's okay.

4653
02:37:43,420 --> 02:37:45,320
He'll go this way and he'll go around.

4654
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:46,140

And then he's gonna stop.

4661
02:37:52,300 --> 02:37:53,840
And then I just have to not die.

4662
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:55,320
Yeah, you just have to not die.

4663
02:37:56,620 --> 02:37:57,340

02:40:56,610 --> 02:40:57,110
Nice, nice.

4752
02:40:57,370 --> 02:40:58,930
Oh, nice.

4753
02:41:03,490 --> 02:41:04,430
Oh, oh, there we go.

4754
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:06,910
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4755
02:41:06,910 --> 02:41:07,590
Oh, you got it?

4756
02:41:08,050 --> 02:41:12,350
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, come on, man, I'm getting spawn
killed.

4757
02:41:16,270 --> 02:41:17,230
Oh, shoot.

4758
02:41:17,650 --> 02:41:18,670
Oh, damn it.

4759
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:20,470
Oh, sorry, did I mess up your...

4760
02:41:21,070 --> 02:41:22,550
My flow, my flow.

4761
02:41:22,850 --> 02:41:24,370
My, your flow, sorry.

4762
02:41:29,470 --> 02:41:39,840
Oh, oh, oh, wait, why is that so slow?

4763
02:41:40,060 --> 02:41:40,620
That's so...

4764
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:42,240
I know.

4765
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:42,700
Oh, shoot.

4766
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:43,360
Oh, shoot.

4767
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,060
Oh, shoot.

4768
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:45,220
Ah, I was so close.

4769
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:54,940
It appears you have thrown off the maid's groove.

4770
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:56,640
Oh, I'm so worried.

4771
02:41:56,780 --> 02:41:58,100
How did I time it before?

4772
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:06,960
She's stuck in a loop, everybody.

4773
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:07,880
She's stuck in a loop.

4774
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:12,880
Not now.

4775
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:15,120
That day is so fast.

4776
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:16,320
really fast.

4777
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:17,760
Oh, nice!

4778
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:22,140
I inadvertently gave.

4779
02:42:23,100 --> 02:42:23,700
Oh, you got it.

4780
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:24,500
You got it.

4781
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:25,220
Okay.

4782
02:42:25,820 --> 02:42:27,200
Okay, I'll catch up.

4783
02:42:28,060 --> 02:42:28,500
Oh, shoot.

4784
02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:28,860
Me.

4785
02:42:29,720 --> 02:42:30,000
Me.

4786
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:31,720
Oh, shoot.

4787
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:32,700
Yeah, that part's tough.

4788
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:33,560
That part's tough.

4789
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:34,540
Oh, my God.

4790
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:35,780
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

4791
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:37,720
Oh, oh.

4792
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:38,720
Oh, oh, oh.

4793
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:39,320
Ah!

4794
02:42:39,320 --> 02:42:39,640
You got it.

4795
02:42:39,640 --> 02:42:39,840
You got it.

4796
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:42,560
Help me.

4797
02:42:43,220 --> 02:42:43,680
Again.

4798
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:44,840
Help me.

4799
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:46,620
Help me!

4800
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:47,800
Help me!

4801
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:48,880
Help me!

4802
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:49,400
Get it!

4803
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:50,540
Yippee!

4804
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:51,380
Let's go!

4805
02:42:52,220 --> 02:42:52,700
Yippee!

4806
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:53,960
Help!

4807
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:55,900
Help me!

4808
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,440
Help me!

4809
02:42:57,440 --> 02:43:00,080
Do you think if you were in like the Walking Dead, you'd
live?

4810
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:00,920
No.

4811
02:43:02,580 --> 02:43:03,580
Me too.

4812
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:08,460
I think I would be a day one victim, to be honest.

4813
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:11,600
Use my body.

4814
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:14,140
Use my body!

4815
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:15,400
Oh.

4816
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:18,420
Why'd you go the opposite way?

4817
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:24,800
What was the point of that room?

4818
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:25,440
Oh, there's a gem in here.

4819
02:43:25,620 --> 02:43:26,080
There's a gem.

4820
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:27,920
Yeah?

4821
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:28,680
Wait.

4822
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:32,660
What?

4823
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:35,180
Oh, I because you can't use a teleporter.

4824
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:36,340
Oh, okay.

4825
02:43:36,980 --> 02:43:37,340
Oh.

4826
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:38,300
Oh.

4827
02:43:38,780 --> 02:43:39,140
Oh.

4828
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:40,320
We're good.

4829
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:41,080
We don't need to go.

4830
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:42,620
I don't think we need to go back in there anymore.

4831
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:43,460
Okay, yeah, we don't.

4832
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:44,280
Use my body!

4833
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:45,400
Okay.

4834
02:43:45,420 --> 02:43:46,700
I'm using your body!

4835
02:43:47,060 --> 02:43:47,380
Yes!

4836
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:51,320
Oh, wait.

4837
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:51,960
How do you...

4838
02:43:51,960 --> 02:43:53,100
But how do you do...

4839
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:54,180
How do I get over there then?

4840
02:43:54,700 --> 02:43:56,380
Yeah, how do you...

4841
02:43:57,460 --> 02:43:58,080
Oh, I see.

4842
02:43:58,140 --> 02:43:59,020
Oh, okay, I see, I see.

4843
02:43:59,200 --> 02:43:59,620
I can make it.

4844
02:43:59,700 --> 02:44:00,080
I can make it.

4845
02:44:00,220 --> 02:44:01,240
Oh, I made it.

4846
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:02,560
Oh, look, yeah, you made it.

4847
02:44:02,660 --> 02:44:03,700
Look at the cat.

4848
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:06,200
Oh, okay, be careful.

4849
02:44:09,860 --> 02:44:10,780
Oh, be careful.

4850
02:44:11,900 --> 02:44:12,300
Oh, no.

4851
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:14,640
That stupid cat.

4852
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:15,400
That stupid cat.

4853
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:15,760
Cat.

4854
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:16,700
Be careful.

4855
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:18,900
I know, the stupid cat.

4856
02:44:20,420 --> 02:44:20,680
Be careful.

4857
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:21,220
You're my body?

4858
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:21,840
Be careful.

4859
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:22,560
Be careful.

4860
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:22,900
Be careful.

4861
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:24,500
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4862
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:26,680
Oh, damn it.

4863
02:44:28,280 --> 02:44:29,580
Oh, so close.

4864
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,100
Be careful.

4865
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:37,300
Oh, I was careful.

4866
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:38,840
I was careful.

4867
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:39,440
You got it.

4868
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:40,040
Be careful.

4869
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:40,760
Okay.

4870
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:42,760
Wait, this is hell.

4871
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,180
What is going on?

4872
02:44:47,890 --> 02:44:48,810
Nice, nice, nice.

4873
02:44:49,050 --> 02:44:49,190
You did it.

4874
02:44:49,210 --> 02:44:49,410
I got it.

4875
02:44:49,410 --> 02:44:49,910
You did it, you did it.

4876
02:44:50,670 --> 02:44:50,890
Okay.

4877
02:44:52,230 --> 02:44:53,710
I think you just run, right?

4878
02:44:53,850 --> 02:44:54,450
I think you just run.

4879
02:44:54,610 --> 02:44:55,450
Yeah, I think you just run.

4880
02:44:57,550 --> 02:44:57,790
Nice!

4881
02:44:57,930 --> 02:44:58,090
Nice!

4882
02:44:58,530 --> 02:44:58,630
Nice, nice!

4883
02:45:03,260 --> 02:45:04,380
You almost made it.

4884
02:45:04,460 --> 02:45:04,960
Oh, oops.

4885
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:06,940
Ah, no.

4886
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:10,180
How am I not, how am I not timing it now?

4887
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:11,880
Yes.

4888
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:12,780
Yeah, how did you make it?

4889
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:14,540
Oh, nice.

4890
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:16,420
Even have time to get the ball.

4891
02:45:16,740 --> 02:45:17,040
Yeah.

4892
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:21,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4893
02:45:22,320 --> 02:45:22,640
Oh!

4894
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:24,520
I lose my double jump there, yeah.

4895
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:26,860
Yeah, that last one is so bad.

4896
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:27,780
Oh.

4897
02:45:30,480 --> 02:45:32,640
Wait, this timing is so...

4898
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:35,490
Ah!

4899
02:45:35,770 --> 02:45:35,950
Ah!

Oh my god.

02:45:39,650 --> 02:45:40,750
You got it though.

4903
02:45:41,170 --> 02:45:41,930
Oh my god.

4904

This guy's so dramatic.

4924
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:48,160
Practice for Celeste.

4925
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:48,800
So true.

4926
02:46:48,980 --> 02:46:49,780
Have you played Celeste?

4927
02:46:50,740 --> 02:46:54,840

Oh, you're good.

4939
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:08,960
You're good.

4940
02:47:09,440 --> 02:47:10,200
Oh, wait.

4941
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,540
Oh, I made it.

4942
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:13,220
I'm kicking you.

4943
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:13,620
I'm kicking you.

4944
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:13,740
Okay.

4945
02:47:13,900 --> 02:47:14,340
I died.

4946
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:15,120
But that's okay.

4947
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:17,500
We're out of some sort of hellhole.

4948
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:22,120
Oh, thank you.

4949
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:23,460
Yeah.

4950
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:23,700
We can.

4951
02:47:23,780 --> 02:47:23,860
Oh.

4952
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:26,820
Yeah, I have not played Celeste.

4953
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:29,460
Like, I played a few levels of Celeste, but...

4954
02:47:29,460 --> 02:47:29,800
Okay.

4955
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:31,100
Are you planning on playing Celeste?

4956
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:32,480
I thought so.

4957
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:33,400
Probably.

4958
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:35,940
It's hard, though.

4959
02:47:36,460 --> 02:47:36,940
Oh, my God.

4960
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:38,040
It does seem like crazy.

4961
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:40,420
Nice!

4962
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:42,040
Oh, oh.

4963
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:43,740
Wait, how do you do that?

4964
02:47:43,880 --> 02:47:44,680
Oh, oh.

4965
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:45,720
You got it.

4966
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:47,600
Oh, shit.

4967
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:48,940
Oh!

4968
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:53,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4969
02:47:55,180 --> 02:47:55,960
Oh, my God.

4970
02:47:56,080 --> 02:47:56,640
Oh, my God.

4971
02:47:56,920 --> 02:47:57,300
Oh, my God.

4972
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:57,560
Stop.

4973
02:47:57,820 --> 02:47:58,100
Stop.

4974
02:47:58,760 --> 02:47:58,820
Stop.

4975
02:47:59,460 --> 02:47:59,720
Ouch.

4976
02:48:00,060 --> 02:48:00,440
Oh, sorry.

4977
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:01,620
Okay.

4978
02:48:03,220 --> 02:48:04,900
Um, what are you supposed to do here?

4979
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:05,320
Okay.

4980
02:48:05,700 --> 02:48:06,520
Here, jump on my head.

4981
02:48:06,700 --> 02:48:06,880
Jump.

4982
02:48:07,060 --> 02:48:07,600
Okay, there you go.

4983
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:08,220
Can you jump over?

4984
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:08,980
Nice.

4985
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:10,580
Oh, don't die.

4986
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:10,960
Don't die.

4987
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:11,380
Don't die.

4988
02:48:11,540 --> 02:48:14,080
Oh, it's okay.

4989
02:48:14,360 --> 02:48:15,020
We'll put this back here.

4990
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:16,060
It's not so bad.

4991
02:48:16,180 --> 02:48:16,380
We good?

4992
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:17,480
Oh, my God.

4993
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:18,180
It's not so...

4994
02:48:18,180 --> 02:48:19,380
It's actually not good at all.

4995
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:21,140
Wait, we need to kill this guy.

4996
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:22,700
This guy needs to die.

4997
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:23,380
We can't.

4998
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:23,900
We can't.

4999
02:48:23,940 --> 02:48:24,620
Yeah, there we go.

5000
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:25,260
Okay.

5001
02:48:25,620 --> 02:48:25,780
Okay.

5002
02:48:25,960 --> 02:48:26,280
Jump.

5003
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:26,980
Jump over me.

5004
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:28,700
Oh.

5005
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,580
You can do it.

5006
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:32,720
Stop!

5007
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:33,120
Stop!

5008
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:33,600
Stop!

5009
02:48:34,980 --> 02:48:35,160
Oh!

5010
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:35,460
Oh!

5011
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:36,060
Oh!

5012
02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:36,840
I'm making it!

5013
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:37,580
Can't do it!

5014
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:38,580
Oh no!

5015
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:40,720
That's so messed up!

5016
02:48:40,900 --> 02:48:41,840
That was so close!

5017
02:48:42,220 --> 02:48:43,380
So messed up!

5018
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:45,400
Okay, I got him for...

5019
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:45,900
Oh, oops.

5020
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:46,880
Oh, oh, oh.

5021
02:48:47,420 --> 02:48:47,880
He...

5022
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:49,500
He revives so quickly.

5023
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:50,660
Yeah, he does.

5024
02:48:50,660 --> 02:48:51,180
Oh, okay.

5025
02:48:51,400 --> 02:48:51,860
There we go.

5026
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:53,920
Oh, oh.

5027
02:48:53,920 --> 02:48:54,660
Ah, no!

5028
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:55,800
He was blocking.

5029
02:48:56,600 --> 02:48:56,960
Okay.

5030
02:48:58,300 --> 02:48:59,000
Okay, go.

5031
02:48:59,260 --> 02:48:59,380
Go.

5032
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:00,300
Oh, my bad.

5033
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:01,660
Okay.

5034
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:02,580
I was not locked in.

5035
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:03,080
Oh.

5036
02:49:04,740 --> 02:49:05,620
It's okay.

5037
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:06,660
Uh-oh.

5038
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:06,820
Ah!

5039
02:49:07,180 --> 02:49:07,440
Minto!

5040
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:08,560
Minto!

5041
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:09,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

5042
02:49:09,740 --> 02:49:10,260
Wait, wait!

5043
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:11,120
That might have been awesome!

5044
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:15,080
You scared me!

5045
02:49:16,860 --> 02:49:19,640

02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:20,560
Thank you, yeah.

5047
02:49:20,700 --> 02:49:22,860
It was just like a little push that you needed.

5048
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:24,780
Okay, okay.

5049
02:49:24,980 --> 02:49:26,480
I guess you could call it that.

5050
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:28,740
See, everybody!

5051
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:30,520

There we go.

02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:22,800
Oh, I think you're supposed to slide technically?

5072
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:23,360
Or maybe?

5073
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:24,140
Actually, I don't know.

5074
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:25,000

Go!

5088
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:40,540

5089
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:42,360
Oh, dude!

02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:44,980
Okay.

02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:46,040
Nice.

5092
02:50:46,220 --> 02:50:46,400
Nice.

5093
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:49,040
Come here, come here, you guys.

5094
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:49,560
Come here, you guys.

5095
02:50:49,580 --> 02:50:50,260
Come here, you guys!

5096
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:55,900
Wait.

5097
02:50:55,900 --> 02:50:56,840
What is going on?

5098
02:50:57,360 --> 02:50:58,680
Oh, you go through there.

5099
02:50:58,780 --> 02:50:59,060
Okay.

5100
02:51:00,340 --> 02:51:01,460
Wait, no, huh?

5101
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:02,420
Oh, shoot.

5102
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:04,860
Oh, oops.

5103
02:51:05,460 --> 02:51:06,100
Just keep going.

5104
02:51:06,380 --> 02:51:06,520
Yeah.

5105
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:07,340
Okay.

5106
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:08,000
Oh, oops.

5107
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:10,900
Oh, why do they move?

5108
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:11,700
I don't know.

5109
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:12,460
They're so annoying.

5110
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:14,720
You're supposed to be my little guy.

5111
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:16,100
And he's...

5112
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:17,840
Okay, come over here and go to my head.

5113
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:19,440
Okay, can you jump over?

5114
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:21,960
Oh, that was so close.

5115
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:29,060
Oh, my God.

5116
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:29,440
Ouch.

5117
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,340
How are you supposed to do this?

5118
02:51:34,120 --> 02:51:35,160
I didn't even move.

5119
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:36,380
I didn't even move, I swear.

5120
02:51:39,480 --> 02:51:39,840
Sorry.

5121
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:40,760
Ouch.

5122
02:51:41,940 --> 02:51:43,000
Wait, can we just cheese it?

5123
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:44,120
Can you just jump on my head?

5124
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:45,680
Like here?

5125
02:51:46,220 --> 02:51:46,800
Like, yeah.

5126
02:51:47,080 --> 02:51:49,460
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

5127
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:50,000
Yes?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5129
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:53,680
Okay.

5130
02:51:53,900 --> 02:51:54,900
Oh, but now I'm stuck.

5131
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:56,020
Oh, oh.

5132
02:51:57,120 --> 02:51:57,700
Oh, no.

5133
02:51:58,040 --> 02:51:58,300
Wait, no.

5134
02:51:58,360 --> 02:51:59,160
We have the checkpoint.

5135
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:00,360
We should be spawned there.

5136
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:01,220
Oh.

5137
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:01,560
There you go.

5138
02:52:01,580 --> 02:52:01,840
There you go.

5139
02:52:01,880 --> 02:52:02,200
There you go.

5140
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:03,300
Keep going.

5141
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:04,620
Okay.

5142
02:52:05,740 --> 02:52:06,360
Oh, oh.

5143
02:52:07,320 --> 02:52:07,760
Close.

5144
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:11,380
Wait, this is good.

5145
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:11,760
This is good.

5146
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:12,220
This is good.

5147
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:13,140
This is good.

5148
02:52:14,740 --> 02:52:15,840
It could be better.

5149
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:16,760
It could be...

5150
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:17,060
Okay, okay.

5151
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:17,420
It's okay.

5152
02:52:19,380 --> 02:52:19,820
Oh!

5153
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:20,700
So close.

5154
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:22,940
I think you just single jump, maybe.

5155
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:24,240
At the very end.

5156
02:52:24,500 --> 02:52:24,520
Okay.

5157
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:25,660
Oh, nice!

5158
02:52:25,880 --> 02:52:26,700
Oh, so close.

5159
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:26,920
Wait.

5160
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:28,040
Thank you.

5161
02:52:28,140 --> 02:52:28,720
Oh, oh, oh.

5162
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:30,380
You gotta be careful of the...

5163
02:52:30,380 --> 02:52:31,580
Yeah, you gotta slide after.

5164
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:33,220
Oh, shoot.

5165
02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:36,000
We don't even need that.

5166
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:37,320
Oh, that was you, not me.

5167
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:38,980
Ah, okay.

5168
02:52:39,740 --> 02:52:40,940
Yeah, we don't even need that guy.

5169
02:52:41,240 --> 02:52:41,700
Wait, wait.

5170
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:43,260
Okay.

5171
02:52:43,260 --> 02:52:43,720
Oh, oops.

5172
02:52:44,940 --> 02:52:45,800

5173
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:47,640

Oh, man.

5263
02:56:06,620 --> 02:56:11,300
Oh, I don't think so.

5264
02:56:11,320 --> 02:56:12,900
I don't know how to get up there by myself.

5265
02:56:15,600 --> 02:56:19,000
No, wait, this is tough because I think I definitely need
you.

5266
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:20,620
How do I get up there though?

5267
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:22,880
Here, I'll try.

5268
02:56:23,400 --> 02:56:23,880
I'll try.

5269
02:56:23,880 --> 02:56:24,060
Wait.

5270
02:56:24,700 --> 02:56:24,980
Oh.

And how do you do this?

5272
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:28,140
How do I get over there?

5273
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:29,460
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

5274
02:56:32,060 --> 02:56:32,460

Ah?

5276
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:35,480
Did we do this out of secret or something?

5277
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:36,740
No, I don't think so.

5278
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:37,440
There's no way.

5279
02:56:39,280 --> 02:56:39,680
Ah?

5280
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:44,680

02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:46,440
Happy New Year's Eve!

5282
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:48,180
How do we do this?

5283
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:52,680
Yeah, I don't know.

5284
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:53,480
I don't know either.

5285
02:56:53,620 --> 02:56:54,040
What the heck?

5286
02:56:54,400 --> 02:56:55,380
You can pull up?

5287
02:56:56,540 --> 02:56:57,740
We are pulling up.

5288
02:56:57,840 --> 02:56:59,700
Yeah, it's just I'm not...

5289
02:56:59,700 --> 02:57:00,840
I can't even make it.

5290
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:01,200
I can't read.

5291
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:02,000
I can't read.

5292
02:57:03,480 --> 02:57:04,380
Oh my god!

5293
02:57:04,700 --> 02:57:04,820
Oh!

5294
02:57:06,380 --> 02:57:06,860
Oh!

5295
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:07,560
Wait, what?

5296
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:09,240
We were doing that the entire time!

5297
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:09,940
We were!

5298
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:11,200
Well, it's okay.

5299
02:57:11,320 --> 02:57:11,780
We got this.

5300
02:57:11,900 --> 02:57:12,420
We got...

5301
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:13,780
That's very strange.

5302
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:14,980
Okay.

5303
02:57:15,840 --> 02:57:16,160
Okay.

5304
02:57:16,380 --> 02:57:17,460
Now we lock in.

5305
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:20,180
Okay, go.

5306
02:57:20,320 --> 02:57:20,840
Just ignore him.

5307
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:21,560
Go, go, go.

5308
02:57:21,620 --> 02:57:21,920
Yeah.

5309
02:57:22,240 --> 02:57:22,640
Oh, shoot.

5310
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:23,180
Oh, shoot.

5311
02:57:23,400 --> 02:57:23,980
Oh, that's right.

5312
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:24,480
Go, go, go.

5313
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:25,580
I'm trying.

5314
02:57:31,140 --> 02:57:32,320
Call him, call him.

5315
02:57:32,480 --> 02:57:33,580
Help, help, help.

5316
02:57:35,660 --> 02:57:36,600
Wait, why did you do that?

5317
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:37,140
Why did you...

5318
02:57:37,140 --> 02:57:37,280
Oh.

5319
02:57:38,900 --> 02:57:39,500
Oh, okay.

5320
02:57:39,620 --> 02:57:40,360
We got it, right?

5321
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:41,900
Yeah.

5322
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:43,980
Oh, you got it?

5323
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:44,380
You got it?

5324
02:57:44,460 --> 02:57:45,180
No, I didn't get the gem.

5325
02:57:45,300 --> 02:57:45,740
I didn't get the gem.

5326
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:47,180
Oh, you didn't get the gem.

5327
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:47,940
No, I died.

5328
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:48,680
Okay, there we go.

5329
02:57:48,780 --> 02:57:49,000
Okay.

5330
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:49,800
Now we're good.

5331
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:50,560
Now we're good.

5332
02:57:50,580 --> 02:57:52,420
Go, go, go, go, go.

5333
02:57:53,320 --> 02:57:53,900
Nice, nice, nice.

5334
02:57:56,980 --> 02:57:57,300
I did.

5335
02:57:57,680 --> 02:57:57,800
Oh, bad.

5336
02:57:58,080 --> 02:57:59,600
You were two gamer that first time.

5337
02:57:59,740 --> 02:57:59,880
Oh!

5338
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:02,440
Oh, nice!

5339
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:03,080
Okay.

5340
02:58:03,620 --> 02:58:04,340
Nice, nice, nice.

5341
02:58:04,540 --> 02:58:05,640
Oh, oh, it's okay.

5342
02:58:05,800 --> 02:58:05,920
It's okay.

5343
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:07,060
Oh, it's not okay.

5344
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:07,780
It's okay.

5345
02:58:07,900 --> 02:58:08,380
I'll make it.

5346
02:58:08,780 --> 02:58:09,300
I live.

5347
02:58:09,460 --> 02:58:10,040
I didn't live.

5348
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:12,480
You got the gemmy!

5349
02:58:13,380 --> 02:58:13,680
Okay, okay.

5350
02:58:14,460 --> 02:58:14,840
Oh, shit.

5351
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:15,500
I made it?

5352
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:16,260
Oh, I died?

5353
02:58:17,180 --> 02:58:18,140
No, you gotta duck on that.

5354
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:20,720
Oh, okay.

5355
02:58:20,820 --> 02:58:21,540
Nice, nice, nice.

5356
02:58:21,780 --> 02:58:22,200
Okay, okay, okay.

5357
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:24,680
Okay, I think maybe...

5358
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:24,880
What?

5359
02:58:25,180 --> 02:58:25,840
I don't know.

5360
02:58:28,180 --> 02:58:28,800
Oh, my God.

5361
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:29,620
Wait, how is it?

5362
02:58:29,640 --> 02:58:30,400
I'm able to get these...

5363
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:31,400
I don't...

5364
02:58:31,400 --> 02:58:32,180
Okay, hold on.

5365
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:33,340
Wait, uh...

5366
02:58:33,700 --> 02:58:34,740
How did I get it before?

5367
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:36,400
I just focused on the bottom one.

5368
02:58:36,460 --> 02:58:37,560
I just focused on the bottom one.

5369
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:39,680
Oh, I was focusing on the top one.

5370
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:40,840
There you go.

5371
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:41,240
There you go.

5372
02:58:42,140 --> 02:58:43,680
But we need the top one too.

5373
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:44,000
Wait, hold on.

5374
02:58:44,140 --> 02:58:44,220
Wait.

5375
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:46,300
Oh, wait, you're right.

5376
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:49,300
Oh, God.

5377
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:50,440
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

5378
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:52,140
I like how you still have the jetpack.

5379
02:58:53,620 --> 02:58:54,040
Oh, do I?

5380
02:58:54,220 --> 02:58:54,460
Yeah.

5381
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:56,020
Oh, my God.

5382
02:58:56,080 --> 02:58:58,200
How have we gotten this before so many...

5383
02:58:58,200 --> 02:58:58,840
So easily.

5384
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:00,720
Oh, there's also this other gemmy here.

5385
02:59:00,860 --> 02:59:01,160
Get that?

5386
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:03,300
There you go.

5387
02:59:03,440 --> 02:59:03,780
Okay, nice.

5388
02:59:04,720 --> 02:59:05,320
Oh, my God.

5389
02:59:07,820 --> 02:59:09,980
I'm too stressed to, like, even think about it.

5390
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:11,140
I always just...

5391
02:59:11,320 --> 02:59:11,720
Stay left!

5392
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:12,020
Leave it alone?

5393
02:59:12,220 --> 02:59:12,580
Nice!

5394
02:59:13,100 --> 02:59:13,720
Okay, autour!

5395
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:14,640
Come on!

5396
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:15,400

5397
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:17,280
Get- okay, it's okay!

5398
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:18,660
It's okay, it's good!

5399
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:18,960
Yeah.

5400
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:22,640
Okay, okay, wait, wait, hold on.

5401
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:24,340
Okay, okay, here!

5402
02:59:24,980 --> 02:59:26,760
You go first and I'll climb on your head.

5403
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:27,700
Okay.

5404
02:59:27,700 --> 02:59:27,880
Oh, okay.

5405
02:59:28,160 --> 02:59:28,560
There you go.

5406
02:59:28,840 --> 02:59:31,100
Oh, why don't you use your jetpack?

5407
02:59:32,200 --> 02:59:32,920
I don't have a...

5408
02:59:32,920 --> 02:59:35,460
On my screen, it's a visual glitch I think.

5409
02:59:35,480 --> 02:59:36,020
Oh, okay, okay.

5410
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:37,320
There we go.

5411
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:38,240
Alright, alright.

5412
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:38,800
Let me go.

5413
02:59:39,720 --> 02:59:40,180
Okay, okay.

5414
02:59:40,280 --> 02:59:40,580
Oh, shoot.

5415
02:59:40,580 --> 02:59:42,640
I think you would jump from that to top.

5416
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:44,020
Here?

5417
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:44,640
Yeah.

5418
02:59:44,900 --> 02:59:45,520
Oh my god.

5419
02:59:45,900 --> 02:59:46,020
Okay.

5420
02:59:48,580 --> 02:59:49,780
How did you do that?

5421
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:50,220
I don't know.

5422
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:51,080
How do we do this?

5423
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:52,340
There we go.

5424
02:59:52,520 --> 02:59:52,920
Oh, there we go.

5425
02:59:53,020 --> 02:59:53,220
There we go.

5426
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:53,620
Okay, nice.

5427
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:56,880
Nice.

5428
02:59:57,400 --> 02:59:57,960
That's okay.

5429
02:59:58,680 --> 02:59:58,940
Go.

5430
02:59:59,300 --> 02:59:59,560
Go.

5431
03:00:00,580 --> 03:00:00,900

Yeah.

5436
03:00:03,260 --> 03:00:03,440
Okay.

5437
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:05,680
What do you do with that?

5438
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:06,300
I don't know.

5439
03:00:07,360 --> 03:00:08,060
Maybe I...

5440
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:09,600
It's okay.

5441
03:00:09,700 --> 03:00:09,840
It's okay.

03:00:09,980 --> 03:00:10,480
I'm coming.

5443
03:00:10,640 --> 03:00:10,800
I'm coming.

5444
03:00:11,140 --> 03:00:12,640
I think I use it to...

5445
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:12,800
Oh.

5446
03:00:13,380 --> 03:00:14,380
Maybe, oh, no, it's okay.

5447
03:00:14,500 --> 03:00:14,840

I got it.

5464
03:00:58,080 --> 03:00:58,360
Okay.

03:00:59,900 --> 03:01:00,380
Just keep going.

5467
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:00,940
I'm going.

5468
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,060
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

5469
03:01:03,800 --> 03:01:05,840
I don't see a checkpoint anywhere.

5470
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:07,500
Oh, there it is.

5471
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:08,080

It's actually not that bad.

5481
03:01:20,640 --> 03:01:21,180
Oh, here we go.

5482
03:01:21,280 --> 03:01:21,420

Hold on.

5493
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:34,940
Can you kick, maybe?

5494
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:37,540
Oh, oh, nice.

5495
03:01:37,880 --> 03:01:38,320
Oh, my God.

5496
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:39,040
Oh, my God.

5497
03:01:39,100 --> 03:01:39,980
But it's just a yarn.

5498
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:40,880
It's just a yarn.

5499
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:42,040
It's just a yarn.

5500
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:42,340
It's just a yarn.

5501
03:01:42,340 --> 03:01:42,580
It's okay.

5502
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:46,520
Oh, yeah.

5503
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:47,160
Okay.

5504
03:01:47,320 --> 03:01:48,060
Throw you over there?

5505
03:01:48,360 --> 03:01:50,340
Oh, oh, oh, I think you need to go.

5506
03:01:50,480 --> 03:01:50,600
Oh, wait.

5507
03:01:51,400 --> 03:01:52,020
Oh, you think so?

5508
03:01:52,220 --> 03:01:52,440
Yeah.

5509
03:01:53,440 --> 03:01:54,020
There you go.

5510
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:55,120
And then I do.

5511
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:56,880
Oh, okay, you got it.

5512
03:01:58,420 --> 03:01:59,800
Oh, what the heck?

5513
03:02:00,260 --> 03:02:00,860
Oh, shoot.

5514
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:02,580
Oh, what?

5515
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:03,460
Wait, what's happening now?

5516
03:02:03,660 --> 03:02:03,960
Oh, my God.

5517
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:04,520
What's happening now?

5518
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:04,760
I don't know.

5519
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:05,020
I don't know.

5520
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:06,080
You, like, freed something.

5521
03:02:06,140 --> 03:02:06,820
We freed something.

5522
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:07,380
Yeah, we did.

5523
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:15,920
Nice.

5524
03:02:16,140 --> 03:02:17,180
Oh, not nice.

5525
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:19,160
Close, close.

5526
03:02:21,060 --> 03:02:21,420
Okay.

5527
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:22,960
Okay, wait, hold on.

5528
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:23,340
All right.

5529
03:02:24,320 --> 03:02:26,640
I don't know how I'm supposed to do anything here.

5530
03:02:27,480 --> 03:02:27,880
Yeah, right.

5531
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:29,140
You go up there.

5532
03:02:29,240 --> 03:02:29,680
You go up there.

5533
03:02:29,960 --> 03:02:30,480
Go, go, go, go.

5534
03:02:31,720 --> 03:02:32,040
Wait.

5535
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:33,860
Wait.

5536
03:02:33,860 --> 03:02:35,180
Why is it opening now?

5537
03:02:35,400 --> 03:02:35,900
Why is it it?

5538
03:02:36,200 --> 03:02:36,520
Wait.

5539
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:37,500
Oh, there it is.

5540
03:02:37,820 --> 03:02:38,240
Oh, there you go.

5541
03:02:38,320 --> 03:02:38,520
There you go.

5542
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:39,500
Oh, my God.

5543
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:40,480
How are you supposed to do this part?

5544
03:02:40,980 --> 03:02:41,580
That's tough.

5545
03:02:42,080 --> 03:02:42,560
Oh, go, go, go.

5546
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:50,260
Oh, what is happening?

5547
03:02:52,200 --> 03:02:53,680
I don't know about this one.

5548
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:54,580
Fairy bug.

5549
03:02:56,340 --> 03:02:56,700
Oh.

5550
03:02:57,240 --> 03:02:57,600
Yeah!

5551
03:02:58,840 --> 03:03:01,260
I need to be so much higher.

5552
03:03:01,620 --> 03:03:02,900
Can we get much higher?

5553
03:03:02,960 --> 03:03:04,300
Can we get much higher?

5554
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:07,600
Oh, you have to make it...

5555
03:03:07,600 --> 03:03:09,100
Okay, okay, I think you got it though.

5556
03:03:09,340 --> 03:03:09,880
I don't know.

5557
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:11,500
Oh my god, no!

5558
03:03:13,180 --> 03:03:14,300
Sorry, sorry, that was...

5559
03:03:15,540 --> 03:03:16,760
It's such bad timing.

5560
03:03:19,020 --> 03:03:19,420
Okay.

5561
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:24,100
Oh my god, no!

5562
03:03:25,160 --> 03:03:26,040
It's okay, it's okay.

5563
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,260
We have infinite strides.

5564
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:31,080
Please!

5565
03:03:32,280 --> 03:03:33,480
Here, I think you need to go again.

5566
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:35,300
Or, oh my god.

5567
03:03:37,240 --> 03:03:37,620
Oh, nice!

5568
03:03:38,080 --> 03:03:38,660
Nice, nice!

5569
03:03:39,480 --> 03:03:41,280
That part is so tricky!

5570
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:42,980
So high!

5571
03:03:43,100 --> 03:03:44,920
Why does this boom do this to us?

5572
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:47,900
Oh, okay.

5573
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:49,760
We call the thing, yeah, call the thing.

5574
03:03:50,040 --> 03:03:52,420
Call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call,
call, call.

5575
03:03:53,100 --> 03:03:53,380
Okay.

5576
03:03:53,780 --> 03:03:54,080
Oh!

5577
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:56,680
Go, go, go!

5578
03:03:56,680 --> 03:03:56,940
Go!

5579
03:03:57,240 --> 03:03:59,280
Up, up, up, up, up.

5580
03:04:00,260 --> 03:04:00,620
Um...

5581
03:04:00,620 --> 03:04:01,700
And then we go this way.

5582
03:04:04,840 --> 03:04:05,560
Oh, nice!

5583
03:04:11,880 --> 03:04:12,240
Uh...

5584
03:04:15,240 --> 03:04:16,200
Nice, nice, nice.

5585
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:19,200
Oh, wait, uh...

5586
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:19,860
There we go!

5587
03:04:20,020 --> 03:04:20,600
Thank you, thank you.

5588
03:04:21,080 --> 03:04:22,300
Alright, here we go!

5589
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:23,960
Ah!

5590
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:27,600
Damn it, okay.

5591
03:04:28,740 --> 03:04:29,360
Oh, God.

5592
03:04:29,380 --> 03:04:30,260
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

5593
03:04:30,980 --> 03:04:32,780
It's been unleashed, whatever happened here.

5594
03:04:33,600 --> 03:04:33,760
Alright.

5595
03:04:34,720 --> 03:04:36,020
Go, go, go!

5596
03:04:37,240 --> 03:04:39,080
Oh my god, the timing here is so tricky.

5597
03:04:40,380 --> 03:04:40,940
Ah, damn it.

5598
03:04:41,080 --> 03:04:41,740
Okay, you go, you go.

5599
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:43,880
I think you might be closer.

5600
03:04:44,160 --> 03:04:44,780
Okay, there you go.

5601
03:04:46,140 --> 03:04:46,900
Oh my god, please.

5602
03:04:49,500 --> 03:04:50,520
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

5603
03:04:55,280 --> 03:04:56,660
It's okay, it's okay.

5604
03:05:01,670 --> 03:05:04,610

5620
03:05:51,070 --> 03:05:51,530
Oh, shoot.

5621
03:05:53,510 --> 03:05:54,590
Um, let me see.

5622
03:05:56,130 --> 03:05:57,230
Oh, do you need me to?

5623
03:05:57,490 --> 03:05:58,250
Wait, but I can't get it.

5624
03:05:58,270 --> 03:05:58,790
Oh, there you go.

5625
03:05:59,050 --> 03:05:59,590
Oh, that's why.

5626
03:05:59,590 --> 03:05:59,930
That's why.

5627
03:05:59,970 --> 03:06:00,170
Okay.

5628
03:06:00,230 --> 03:06:00,630
You go.

5629
03:06:00,990 --> 03:06:02,310
Oh, no, no.

5630
03:06:02,610 --> 03:06:03,250
Oh, oh, my bad.

5631
03:06:03,370 --> 03:06:03,550
My bad.

5632
03:06:03,710 --> 03:06:04,230
Okay, I'll hold it.

5633
03:06:04,250 --> 03:06:04,490
Oh, okay.

5634
03:06:08,890 --> 03:06:09,210
Nice.

5635
03:06:10,750 --> 03:06:11,190
Oh, shoot.

5636
03:06:11,950 --> 03:06:12,750
Oh, what does this do?

5637
03:06:12,830 --> 03:06:14,530
Okay, so I have to hold here.

5638
03:06:15,610 --> 03:06:16,350
Uh, wait.

5639
03:06:16,570 --> 03:06:17,270
Oh, oh.

5640
03:06:17,310 --> 03:06:17,950
Okay, there you go.

5641
03:06:18,110 --> 03:06:18,990
Wait, where does it go to, though?

5642
03:06:19,710 --> 03:06:21,270
Uh, I go to lava.

5643
03:06:21,530 --> 03:06:21,790
There's nothing.

5644
03:06:21,830 --> 03:06:22,490
Oh, I think I...

5645
03:06:22,490 --> 03:06:23,390
Okay, I can time it.

5646
03:06:23,450 --> 03:06:23,890
I can time it.

5647
03:06:23,950 --> 03:06:24,270
Here you go.

5648
03:06:24,770 --> 03:06:25,550
Oh, I'm bad.

5649
03:06:25,710 --> 03:06:26,070
Oh, oh, oh.

5650
03:06:26,370 --> 03:06:27,070
Where do I go though?

5651
03:06:27,110 --> 03:06:27,890
I don't know where to go.

5652
03:06:28,970 --> 03:06:29,290
Up.

5653
03:06:29,730 --> 03:06:30,490
Oh, my God.

5654
03:06:30,930 --> 03:06:32,990
My tippy toe is precedent.

5655
03:06:33,110 --> 03:06:33,270
Okay.

5656
03:06:33,710 --> 03:06:34,150
All right.

5657
03:06:34,230 --> 03:06:34,530
Here you go.

5658
03:06:35,150 --> 03:06:35,530
Oh, my God.

5659
03:06:35,530 --> 03:06:36,190
I do that.

5660
03:06:38,230 --> 03:06:38,950
And then...

5661
03:06:38,950 --> 03:06:39,610
There you go.

5662
03:06:39,750 --> 03:06:39,950
There you go!

5663
03:06:40,190 --> 03:06:40,810
Nice, nice, nice!

5664
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:42,330
Okay, I have to do the same thing.

5665
03:06:42,490 --> 03:06:44,330
So you have to get off of it every now and then.

5666
03:06:44,890 --> 03:06:44,930
Okay.

5667
03:06:45,990 --> 03:06:46,350
There you go.

5668
03:06:46,350 --> 03:06:46,750
All right, there you go.

5669
03:06:46,870 --> 03:06:47,070
Nice!

5670
03:06:48,910 --> 03:06:49,070
Huh?

5671
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:49,530
Shut up, Hattie!

5672
03:06:53,090 --> 03:06:55,190
How do you...

5673
03:06:55,190 --> 03:06:55,210
Oh!

5674
03:06:56,250 --> 03:06:56,930
Oh, I don't know.

5675
03:06:57,170 --> 03:06:57,410
Okay.

5676
03:06:57,710 --> 03:06:58,630
Oh, we're almost there, though!

5677
03:06:59,510 --> 03:06:59,950

Nice, nice, nice.

5713
03:07:47,330 --> 03:07:49,190
Ah, not this jetpack session.

5714
03:07:49,270 --> 03:07:50,890
I know, we have to do this again.

5715
03:07:52,130 --> 03:07:52,790
Okay, you do it, you do it.

5716
03:07:52,790 --> 03:07:53,810
This is such a time sink.

5717
03:07:53,950 --> 03:07:54,950
It's such a time sink.

5718
03:07:56,970 --> 03:07:57,370
Oh, shit.

5719
03:07:58,090 --> 03:07:58,330

Oh, where am I?

5721
03:08:00,830 --> 03:08:01,950
Why am I all the way over there?

5722
03:08:03,570 --> 03:08:04,210
No, why?

5723
03:08:04,210 --> 03:08:05,150
Why does it hate me?

5724
03:08:05,950 --> 03:08:06,290
Why?

5725
03:08:06,650 --> 03:08:07,050
Wait, why?

5726
03:08:07,050 --> 03:08:08,670
Give it to me!

5727
03:08:09,970 --> 03:08:11,050
Wait, why is it doing that?

5728
03:08:13,410 --> 03:08:13,890
Oh my god.

5729
03:08:14,730 --> 03:08:15,610
My head.

5730
03:08:16,570 --> 03:08:17,130
Okay, okay, okay.

5731
03:08:17,930 --> 03:08:18,930
Okay, here you go.

Oh, shoot.

5733
03:08:21,830 --> 03:08:21,950
Okay.

03:08:23,750 --> 03:08:24,230
Nice!

5736
03:08:24,690 --> 03:08:33,270
Oh my god, I didn't even realize I got it.

5737
03:08:34,690 --> 03:08:35,650
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

5738
03:08:35,650 --> 03:08:36,710
Oh, Berrybug, this part's hard!

5739
03:08:37,050 --> 03:08:38,150

03:08:43,670 --> 03:08:44,070
It's okay.

5747
03:08:44,330 --> 03:08:45,830
I know it's hard.

5748
03:08:45,930 --> 03:08:46,270
I know it's hard.

5749
03:08:46,430 --> 03:08:46,730
Take your time.

5750
03:08:47,010 --> 03:08:47,450
It's fine.

5751
03:08:47,450 --> 03:08:48,030
It's totally fine.

5752
03:08:49,010 --> 03:08:50,710
This is like the longest section.

5753
03:08:50,910 --> 03:08:52,970
So you can spend however long you...

5754
03:08:52,970 --> 03:08:53,490

It's okay.

5804
03:10:15,510 --> 03:10:16,150
We have 30 seconds.

5805
03:10:16,230 --> 03:10:16,730
We have 30 seconds.

5806
03:10:17,430 --> 03:10:17,610
Okay.

5807
03:10:17,850 --> 03:10:18,090
What?

5808
03:10:18,930 --> 03:10:19,650
Oh, wait.

My bad.

5811
03:10:20,510 --> 03:10:20,810
It's okay.

5812
03:10:20,890 --> 03:10:21,030
It's okay.

5813
03:10:21,270 --> 03:10:21,570
Okay.

5814
03:10:23,390 --> 03:10:23,530
Oh.

5815
03:10:27,390 --> 03:10:27,790
Do

5816
03:10:34,630 --> 03:10:35,030
it.

5817
03:10:36,110 --> 03:10:36,870
Oh, he's dead.

5818
03:10:37,050 --> 03:10:38,010
He's definitely dead.

5819
03:10:38,170 --> 03:10:38,670
No, he's not.

5820
03:10:39,130 --> 03:10:40,250
Something's very wrong here.

5821
03:10:40,650 --> 03:10:43,930
If you can't carry yourself, then we'll carry it for you.

5822
03:10:44,270 --> 03:10:44,750
Yeah.

5823
03:10:45,930 --> 03:10:47,030
Get out of here.

5824
03:10:47,170 --> 03:10:47,490
We gotta run.

5825
03:10:47,510 --> 03:10:48,150
Oh, we gotta go.

5826
03:10:48,490 --> 03:10:48,930
We gotta run.

5827
03:10:50,130 --> 03:10:51,370
I took a medal.

5828
03:10:51,690 --> 03:10:51,870
I have a trophy, too.

5829
03:10:52,130 --> 03:10:52,550
I have a trophy.

5830
03:10:54,070 --> 03:10:54,550
Woo!

5831
03:10:55,370 --> 03:10:56,190
Oh, my.

5832
03:10:56,330 --> 03:10:57,490
Wait, they have, like, guns.

5833
03:10:57,710 --> 03:10:59,490
And so we finally made it back to the boat.

5834
03:10:59,490 --> 03:11:00,590
We did it!

5835
03:11:00,870 --> 03:11:01,310
Is that it?

5836
03:11:01,650 --> 03:11:02,610
Is that the end of the game?

5837
03:11:02,630 --> 03:11:03,530
I think that's it.

5838
03:11:04,010 --> 03:11:05,130
Oh, my God.

5839
03:11:06,110 --> 03:11:13,030

Wait, we did all of that, but it was not even...

5845
03:11:46,190 --> 03:11:47,110
We tried to... Wait.

5846
03:11:50,310 --> 03:11:52,090
Wait, he's just dead.

5847
03:11:53,450 --> 03:11:54,590
After all that, he's dead.

5848
03:11:54,590 --> 03:11:56,050
After all of that, he was dead.

5849
03:11:56,710 --> 03:11:57,270
Yeah.

5850
03:11:58,490 --> 03:11:59,050

03:13:11,170 --> 03:13:13,550
Why are they telling us to buckle our pants?

5861
03:13:14,430 --> 03:13:17,190
Why are they telling us to do that?

5862
03:13:17,890 --> 03:13:19,210
I have no clue.

5863
03:13:22,230 --> 03:13:24,110
I think I'm confused, but...

5864
03:13:29,390 --> 03:13:31,570
It's just the ending credits, I guess.

5865
03:13:32,390 --> 03:13:34,190
Buckle your pants, buckle your pants.

5866
03:13:34,190 --> 03:13:38,370
Because my pants will fall to the ground.

5867
03:13:40,570 --> 03:13:42,610
Otherwise, you'll be the fool who ripped his pants.

5868
03:13:42,890 --> 03:13:44,210
Or dropped his pants.

5869
03:13:44,910 --> 03:13:46,230
Yeah, he dropped his pants.

5870
03:13:47,950 --> 03:13:49,310
Has your pants ever ripped on you?

5871
03:13:49,450 --> 03:13:51,190
Oh, oh, he's actually...

5872
03:13:55,490 --> 03:13:58,690
I saw this compilation recently of people, like, ripping
their pants.

5873
03:13:58,810 --> 03:14:00,070
And I was like, oh, my God.

5874
03:14:01,250 --> 03:14:02,790
I forgot that was a thing that happened.

5875
03:14:05,470 --> 03:14:05,770
Wait!

5876
03:14:05,850 --> 03:14:07,590
He has the hat again!

5877
03:14:07,750 --> 03:14:09,210
Oh, the hat is calling!

5878
03:14:09,310 --> 03:14:11,230
Wait, what's going on?

5879
03:14:11,630 --> 03:14:12,230
Do you press?

5880
03:14:12,970 --> 03:14:15,130
Oh, oh, are we...

5881
03:14:15,130 --> 03:14:17,930
Wait, what just happened?

5882
03:14:19,050 --> 03:14:21,630
I pressed the button and it ended.

5883
03:14:22,050 --> 03:14:23,870
Wait, did we skip the...

5884
03:14:23,870 --> 03:14:24,790
Did we...

5885
03:14:24,790 --> 03:14:26,370
Did I skip the cutscene accident?

5886
03:14:36,710 --> 03:14:37,870
One more time?

5887
03:14:38,010 --> 03:14:40,430
I mean, it was probably gonna end there.

5888
03:14:40,590 --> 03:14:42,130
Wait, is there not like a...

5889
03:14:42,130 --> 03:14:46,050
There's got to be like a view video, view movie, right?

5890
03:14:47,170 --> 03:14:48,490
I think, yeah, surely.

5891
03:14:48,870 --> 03:14:50,490
Level, it's not a level editor.

5892
03:14:51,090 --> 03:14:51,530
Achievements?

5893
03:14:53,170 --> 03:14:54,870
Oh, we're so fucked.

5894
03:14:57,670 --> 03:14:58,630
Wait, hold on.

5895
03:14:58,910 --> 03:15:01,990
Battle block theater ending.

5896
03:15:02,430 --> 03:15:03,910
I think we're at the very end.

5897
03:15:04,010 --> 03:15:05,410
No, we earned this.

5898
03:15:05,410 --> 03:15:06,230
We earned this, guys.

5899
03:15:06,310 --> 03:15:06,810
We could do this.

5900
03:15:06,870 --> 03:15:07,810
Will you send me a link?

5901
03:15:09,810 --> 03:15:10,410
Oh, shit.

5902
03:15:10,490 --> 03:15:11,890
Wait, we were not at the very...

5903
03:15:11,890 --> 03:15:13,130
There was like a minute left.

5904
03:15:17,890 --> 03:15:19,670
Yeah, I'll send you the video.

5905
03:15:21,130 --> 03:15:22,410

03:15:34,930 --> 03:15:37,830
And I also didn't expect clicking it to...

5912
03:15:40,270 --> 03:15:42,210
Wait, I gotta exit the game then.

5913
03:15:42,590 --> 03:15:43,730

03:28:45,270 --> 03:28:46,530
We'll keep buried.

6115
03:28:46,770 --> 03:28:49,330
This is like an accurately sized ladybug, no?

6116
03:28:53,170 --> 03:28:53,810
Smaller, smaller.

6138
03:30:09,570 --> 03:30:10,510
Why is she like that?

6139
03:30:11,330 --> 03:30:12,330
Why is she confused now?

6140
03:30:13,110 --> 03:30:14,030
