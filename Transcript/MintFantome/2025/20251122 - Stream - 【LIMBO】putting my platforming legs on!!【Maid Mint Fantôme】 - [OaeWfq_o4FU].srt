1
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,860
Oh, there we go.

2
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,980
I'm so small.

3
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,820
I almost went to the game, my game screen, because I was
like, we're gaming, and I was like, wait a second.

4
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,420
No, I'm having trouble with the game.

5
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,140
My, my, my.

6
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,330
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

7
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,670
Welcome.

8
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,090
I almost, I like my new loading screen so much.

9
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,730
I almost just want to keep it.

10
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:50,970
Running the whole time so I can just watch it over and over
again Because it's so cute It's so cute You guys like it?

11
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:00,230
Basically, my idea with it is I want to In the future, when
I get like a new outfit or when I think of something new I

12
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:09,130
want to like keep adding on to it So if we maybe we have
like another big game memory or something add on to it like

13
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:17,030
with that or and like i said a new outfit or i of course i
want to add like vicky and phoebe in the future too and

14
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:31,870
stuff so that's the that's the idea that's the idea now
eventually maybe one day it'll get so long i will i will

15
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:44,450
keep i will keep noelle and and we uh they're gonna they're
always i will be like it's time i'll i'll crawl into the dms

16
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:55,930
and i'll be like hello and they're like yes yes me though 15
minute loading it'll be so long that like it would be

17
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:05,650
different every time because because it would it wouldn't it
would be so long that the whole thing couldn't play.

18
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,250
So, you might be wondering, is the hot dog an official
outfit?

19
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,730
Yeah, baby.

20
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,290
You might be wondering, especially if you're watching the
VOD or did not catch me in pre-chat, I was having some

21
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,150
technical difficulties with Limbo.

22
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,750
Okay, so I'm going to explain what was happening.

23
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:43,050
So, the game does not have a Like, this is, this, this is,
like, kind of rare where I feel like I can't solve a problem

24
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,910
with, like, game capture.

25
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,910
But for some reason, the game just won't capture with, like,
normal OBS game capture.

26
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,650
And then when I tried to window capture it, it does not even
show up.

27
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,310
I guess I could desktop, I feel like my only last option, I
did not try it, is desktop.

28
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,270
capture, but I'm scared.

29
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,450
I'm scared of that option.

30
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,630
I guess I could do that.

31
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,670
I think I might have to.

32
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,250
Now that I think about it.

33
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:27,370
So what I was going to do was I was like, oh, well, you
know, I can play on my mini PC that I use for.

34
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,210
I explained that to Nimmy.

35
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,670
She was like, how do you play some of

36
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:44,570
computer and then you use it only for those but um uh uh
what was i saying

37
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:57,750
um oh what i was gonna do it on that because i was just like
oh i can just capture it because you know it is capturing

38
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:07,110
the computer itself and i'll play through there but then i
remembered as i was setting it up As I was setting it up, I

39
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,470
remembered that Steam will yell at me.

40
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,610
It will be like, um, no, ma'am, you are already playing
VTube Studio on another computer.

41
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,210
So you cannot play this game.

42
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,270
And then I checked if GOG had it.

43
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,010
And of course they don't have it.

44
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,910
So I was like, ah.

45
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,930
Yeah, wagging his finger at me.

46
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,860
So.

47
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,500
Second account.

48
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,080
I don't have a second account.

49
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,360
I don't...

50
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,160
Okay, I know that you can do some things in offline mode,
but I'm actually not sure how to do it.

51
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,420
How do I run in offline mode?

52
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,800
How do I do that?

53
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,360
It's my birthday today!

54
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,960
Rafa, happy birthday!

55
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,320
Denso2exe, the debut was so cool.

56
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,340
I can't wait to see all the beautiful things you're going to
do together.

57
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,520
Thank you!

58
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,960
Oh, actually, thank you for reminding me.

59
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,480

60
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,020
Wait, how do I?

61
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,620
Oh, I want to set up the raid into it.

62
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,820
So I don't want to forget, you know.

63
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,060
Redirect to Den-Setsu.

64
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,840
Den-Setsu.

65
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,100
Is playing on console not an option?

66
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,200
Unfortunately, I don't have it on console.

67
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh no, it won't let me raid into it.

68

Oh, here we go.

84
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,950
There we go, there we go.

85
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:44,990
Um...

86
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,230
Close out.

87
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,010
Steam.

88
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,390
Oh my gosh, this computer's so funny.

89
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,610
It just has Mystery of the Druids and Harvester on it.

90
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,070
Steam open.

91
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,450
What do you mean, error?

92
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,830
Don't give me that.

93
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,180
Oh, I need to get on Wi-Fi.

94
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Connect.

95
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
Wait, please don't ask for the password.

96
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,280
Please connect.

97
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
Don't ask for the password.

98
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,060
Yippee!

99
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,600
Okay.

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
Okay, now I have to find it.

101
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,280
Wait, where are you?

102
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,660
Hello?

103
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,680
Actually, I'm just going to type it in.

104
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,300
What am I... Oh, limbo.

105
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,810
We're doing it live, folks.

106
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,950
We're doing it live.

107
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,630
We're doing it live, Insta.

108
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,450
You may need to run the game once first before going
offline.

109
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:44,890
Okay.

110
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,830
Thank you.

111
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,830
Well, if it'll let me.

112
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,890
I don't know if it will.

113
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,050
We'll see.

114
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,630
Okay.

115
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,710
All installed.

116
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,110
Very cool.

117
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,810
Let me see if it'll let me play.

118
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:02,590
Huh?

119
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,170
Oh.

120
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,010
It got angry at me.

121
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,070
One ombu rice, please.

122
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,630
Yes.

123
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,890
Yes.

124
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,010
Thank you.

125
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,110
Take your iPhone camera and point it at the screen.

126
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,410
So true.

127
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,750
Okay.

128
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,690
Go away, go away.

129
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,450
All right, cool.

130
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,650
Now let me go offline.

131
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,670
I'm going offline.

132
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,970
Okay.

133
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,630
Am I offline?

134
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,270
Yes.

135
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,050
All right, play.

136
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,610
Please play the game.

137
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,390
My tail.

138
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,730
Oh,

139
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,780
it disappeared.

140
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,480
Oh, it closed.

141
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,960
It crashed.

142
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,560
It disappeared.

143
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,740
Oh, every time I open the game, it...

144
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
Oh, oh, okay.

145
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,220
So, so...

146
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,720

I'm gonna try and just find another cord.

157
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,560
I don't want to reach back there.

158
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,540
Can you hear me?

159
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,040
Yeah, we should discuss.

160
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,280
So...

161
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,960
Wisp...

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,580
Name.

163
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,460
I had two ideas that were so gracious.

164
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,680
given to me.

165
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,260
Thank you everybody for all your input.

166
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,780
No, I don't want to be Laboobus.

167
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,940
I don't want that.

168
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,330
Because, you know what?

169
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,150
Also, it will be out of style in a year.

170
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:52,990
People are already finding Laboobus in like, in like thrift
stores.

171
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,270
It's a tear, it's terrible.

172
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,910
We're not, we're just, we're not following fads.

173
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,350
We're not doing that.

174
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,150
All right, please work.

175
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,830
Please work.

176
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,990
Oh, I pray to thee.

177
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,050
Yeah.

178
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,890
Oh, oh.

179
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,270
It works.

180
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,090
Oh my gosh.

181
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,850
I'm so excited.

182
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,530
Good job, guys.

183
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,270
We did it, team.

184
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,950
We did it.

185
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,270
Now I know some people are pretty attached to the name.

186
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,770
I totally understand that.

187
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,630
You can still use it.

188
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:45,450
Um, you know, technically it's not like, it's like a normal
word.

189
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,210
It's not like a fan name.

190
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:54,070
So it still applies to you guys because that's like, you
know, kind of just how ghosts are a bit, you know?

191
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,590
So, hmm.

192
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:03,510
For those who did not see yesterday during the debut, I
admitted something very sad.

193
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:12,630
I admitted something very sad, which was that the word...

194
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,750
It's not whisp.

195
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,170
It's...

196
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,050
Whisps.

197
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,890
Bad as well.

198
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,150
Literal skill issue.

199
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,430
Yeah, you could say that.

200
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,380
And it has not...

201
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:51,900
gotten any better like in fact it's gotten what worse with
how i tried with me trying to say it so um i apologize that

202
00:15:51,900 --> 00:16:05,080
i chose this and i can't say it so i saw some um awesome
suggestions being thrown around and some not so awesome

203
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:15,960
suggestions we can't make everybody happy um i will give two
options and i will have them two options that i really

204
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:27,900
really liked i will put them up in the pole and um we'll go
from there and you know like i said if you like wisp then

205
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:43,620
that's okay you can keep saying that too but yeah yeah we
will do that also okay good i do have it okay all right here

206
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:53,660
are the two options that i whoa what the heck schedule your
live to switch to members only oh members what the heck they

207
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:03,100
added that that's new what if i accidentally click that that
would suck okay decide your fate You can choose between

208
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:10,380
eyeball, like eyeball, or butaku, like otaku.

209
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,980
Yeah, start pole.

210
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,340
You legit had me fooled for over a year?

211
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,780
I would not say it very often because I was struggling so
much with it.

212
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,620
Oh no, I like both.

213
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,220
This is an extremely hard choice.

214
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,920
I know it is for me too.

215
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,960
I think they're both really cute.

216
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,920
Oh, I feel like I could call you guys that really, both of
them really easily.

217
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Like, Aibu, Aibu, come help me in this game.

218
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,220
Or Butaku, butaku.

219
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,400
I feel like I'm going to get really annoying about saying it
now.

220
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,760
So that I can be, so I can make up for all the times that
I've not called you with.

221
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:23,200
so I feel like Aibu also kind of has like a double meaning
because I in Japanese is love so you can't even if you

222
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:37,040
choose that you can't even say that I hate you guys because
and because then it's a little double meaning why didn't you

223
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,780
tell is that?

224
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,620
Oh, what do you mean?

225
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,160
What do you want me to redo the poll after telling you that?

226
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Butaku voters didn't think that.

227
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,300
Okay, I'll redo the poll.

228
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,880
You guys, okay, we'll redo it.

229
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
We'll redo it.

230
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,700
But put your real honest answer.

231
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,140
I like both of them very much.

232
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,060
But it's also getting friend-zoned at the same time because
you're like, Aibo, you know, your partner.

233
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,280
Butaku sounds like you're calling us pigs

234
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,580
Decide your fate, part two.

235
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,880
I like both.

236
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,740
I, boo.

237
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,260
Boo-taku.

238
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,260
Boo-u.

239
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,220
Boo-taku.

240
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,360
I like them both very much.

241
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,540
Yeah, I think pigs and pigs make the boo.

242
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,400
No, they go boo-hee, boo-hee.

243
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,120
they don't go boo boo

244
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:53,220
i'm officially voting no vetoed we're not keeping well like
i said you can keep for yourself but not me baby corey thank

245
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,280
you so much for the fun guilty

246
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:09,620
solid mint and her partner in crime buta con buta cons
actually sounds like like you're you're a freaks for pigs

247
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,280
you know you're not loli con you're not shota con you're
Buta kind.

248
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,480
Who told you?

249
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,460
Who told me what?

250
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,860
Oh, that you're a freak for the pig.

251
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,760
I'll be a pig for you, girl.

252
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,790
Boo-hee!

253
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,630
Boo-hee!

254
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,410
I-boo, like, partner.

255
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,570
But I feel like Buta-ku fits our theme very well because...

256
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:11,290
you know the otaku go to the maid cafes ah it's tough choice
but i see many people like eyeball i like it too very easy

257
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:21,890
to say they're both good i like them so much why not both we
can't have both we can't have both i like eyeball very much

258
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,070
though eyeball sounds cuter shall we choose

259
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,110
Are you guys my little eyeball?

260
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,290
My eyeballs?

261
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,910
My eye boobs?

262
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,530
I'll call you eye boobs when you're being stupid.

263
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,410
Hey, stop being an eye boob.

264
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,650
Eye boob!

265
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,610
Eye boob, eye boob, eye boob.

266
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,570
Eye boob, eye boob, eyeball, eyeball, eyeball.

267
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,050
Just call us my boos.

268
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,730
Not very social at all.

269
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,890
Oh my god, see those?

270
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,910
Thank you so much!

271
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,710
Why can't we be phantoms?

272
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,650
That's like my last name though.

273
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,010
Ghost Otaku?

274
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,810
Paranormal Superfan?

275
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,690
Well that's what I guess Butaku would have been.

276
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,470
But I think Aibu is pretty cute too.

277
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,190
Aibu!

278
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,190
Like I said, we can't make everybody happy, but I still
think this is a pretty cute name.

279
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,050
Hopefully it grows on you guys as well!

280
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,190
So, Aibu, Aibu, Aibu.

281
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,390
Taking your surname.

282
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,030
Stop!

283
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,770
Stop it!

284
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,470
I wear the pants in this relationship.

285
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,670
Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu.

286
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,750
I could say it so fast!

287
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,070
It's so easily!

288
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,010
Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu!

289
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,290
Butaku sounds somewhat adult?

290
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:09,830

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:30,130

294
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:18,870
this now now it feels like my my re-debut debut debut is all
is all complete.

295
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,830
I think Cash Money Robots.

296
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,310
We can't all be legends like him.

297
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,310
Ibu play name, but I won't forget it.

298
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,730
Well, we all just call ourselves Adamskas.

299
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,890
Can we pretend that is...

300
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,610
Wisps is our species name, but we are called Ibu.

301
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,090
Sure.

302
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,470
Sure.

303
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,530
You know, back when I like first...

304
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,110
When I first...

305
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:59,910
Kind of, if you watched Phoebe's debut, she had a similar
situation where she called all of her fans the Phoebe hive,

306
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,330
you know.

307
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:05,670
And back when I... before I went to heaven, everybody was
called the fandom.

308
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,330
Which is such a great name.

309
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,250
But it's not like... you can't say like, I am fandom.

310
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:11,930
You know?

311
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,910
It's only... it's like plural only.

312
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:15,750
So...

313
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,190
We, uh, boo.

314
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,950
She's just called boo.

315
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,770
What if we combine both?

316
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,950
I think it becomes a little too much.

317
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,150
That's just my opinion, though.

318
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:28,910
Hmm.

319
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,030
Yeah, you say, like, I am in the fandom.

320
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:38,010
So, that's why when I came back, I was like, I don't think I
have, like, a fan name.

321
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,010
I only have, like, a fandom name.

322
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,190
So, it was really hard for me to think of something, and,
you know,

323
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,090
But now I think Aibu is very, very cute.

324
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,340
And you guys are still little, little wisps.

325
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,240
You guys are still because, you know, that's how ghosts are.

326
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,360
You're like the little willow wisps.

327
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,720
Yeah, so.

328
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,140
Aibu!

329
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,020
Alright, shall we play now?

330
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,940
Shall we play the game?

331
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,660
I got it working, so I think we will be good, I think so.

332
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,680
Let's try.

333
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,160
Let's go.

334
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,580
Let's go.

335
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,020
Let's go.

336
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,300
Where is it?

337
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,840
Wait!

338
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,160
Uh-oh.

339
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:38,620
Wait.

340
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,260
Oh, that's why.

341
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,180
Yay!

342
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,220
Let me turn off the music.

343
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,760
Okay.

344
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,760

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,860
Congrats on the redew.

349
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,420
Thank you so much.

350
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Thank you for the pink.

351
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,500
Seeing your dreams all finally coming true.

352
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,700
Has been worth being a fan.

353
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,640
Thank you.

354
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,080
Happy birthday, Ibu is...

355
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,280
Wait.

356
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,960
Where's my...

357
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,780
Why do I always lose my kazoo?

358
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,820
I always lose it.

359
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, there.

360
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,980
Happy birthday!

361
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:02,120
That's me simulating one of those things that you blow and
the confetti comes out.

362
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,700
Any chance that Densetsu Dai Yixi might do a cassette
release of your music?

363
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,140
There's a handful of us that still collect them.

364
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,980
I would never say never.

365
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,940
I don't think we have any plan at the moment, but never say
never.

366
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,540
Is it fandom with pH or fandom, like with an F?

367
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,900
Yeah, we don't have to use that though.

368
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,940
I know it gets convoluted.

369
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,580
I don't want to like, I don't want to make anything ever
confusing and people be like, wait, like, you know, I don't

370
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,140
want newscomers to come in and be like, am I, am I Wisp?

371
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,960
Am I fandom?

372
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,220
Am I I boo?

373
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,200
What's going on?

374
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,940
You know, so.

375
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,800
I want things to be as simple and easy as possible.

376
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,460
What are we?

377
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,580
What's my identity?

378
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,060
Everybody, everybody's going to need therapy because they
don't know.

379
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Who they are anymore.

380
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,320
Who am I?

381
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,780
But yeah, let's start limbo.

382
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm not very flexible.

383
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,900
I don't think I can do well if I try to limbo.

384
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,460
Oh my gosh, wait, next 3D I should try to limbo.

385
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,960
I should try.

386
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,180
What?

387
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,160
I forgot to talk about something else.

388
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:37,760
that's my train of thought is maybe too obvious but but nimi
brought it up yesterday too how how me her and phoebe we all

and I hang out outside of like a like a convention um

394
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:36,820
environment so it was my first time being able to like hang
out with Phoebe and like uh go do stuff together we did oh

395
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:45,480
my gosh it was Nimmy and I's I'm not gonna go too much in
this into into stories but it was Nimmy and I's first ever

396
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:58,640
escape room oh my gosh I feel like I was missing out I feel
like I was missing out of like of the escape room hype it

397
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:06,040
was so awesome and so what we were gonna do is we were gonna
go for like the theme that we liked the most but then they

398
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:15,340
kept selling out and the only like the time slots that we
could make it to and oh and the only one left was the nine

399
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:29,100
out of ten most difficult real and you know what We, one
minute, 40 seconds left to spare.

400
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,560
We made it out, baby!

401
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,200
Yeah!

402
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,560
Yeah!

403
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,160
Our first ever, and it was Phoebe's second escape room ever.

404
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,700
We, like, we, like, seriously, especially Phoebe.

405
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,340
Phoebe brained like crazy.

406
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:55,760
But, like, we were like, we're gamers, and we've done stuff
like, you know, like, room well actually it was funny nimi

407
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:08,900
was like you play those point and click games minto and i
was like yeah with a guy with a guide but yeah it felt like

408
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:18,060
it felt like i was like we play enough video games i think
we're fine we can we got this and we did it was crazy with

409
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:29,400
one minute and 40 i mean we we did use some hints but that's
okay it was our first one ever

410
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,960
and yeah oh I was happy too because I learned I did not know
this is that sometimes with escape rooms they will pair you

411
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:51,840
with random people they're not gonna make it they're not
gonna make it they made it yeah sometimes they'll pair you

412
00:32:51,840 --> 00:33:00,540
with random people if they want like the room to be full and
luckily it was just the three of us because the room was not

413
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:11,540
very big i was like we would be on top of these other people
if we were trying to all be together i feel yeah so it was

414
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:18,100
just the three of us so we we actually all big brained all
by ourselves but at first two we were like maybe we would

415
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:26,300
want some other people because you know what if like we
don't know what we're room things like that imagine if you

416
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:33,840
ended up with an escape room otaku i was worried too what if
we got somebody that like kind of backseeded us or like

417
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,780
tried to take control we were all very good at like you know
delegating and being like okay i handled this and you try

418
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:54,160
this and you know it was really great so yeah it was really
good the chat experience iRL wake up little guy wake up It's

419
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,140
time to limbo.

420
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,400
You'll be late for the party.

421
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,140
Wake up.

422
00:33:59,420 --> 00:33:59,960
Wake up.

423
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,540

Yeah.

426
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,160
Would have been extra awkward if those randos were fans.

427
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't think that...

428
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,540
I don't...

429
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,700
I think...

430
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,060
I mean...

431
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,660
Maybe Nimi.

432
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,660
I think I'd be okay.

433
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,640
I've never seen in the wild.

434
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,560

00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:30,840

Oh, yes there is.

441
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,480
There is a fall damage.

442
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,500
I learned.

443
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,440
Oh.

444
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,220
And also...

445
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
Oh, those are spikes!

446
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,440
I thought that was mud.

447
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,720
Oopsie.

448
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,780
Okay.

00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,500
I thought it was mud.

451
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:04,800
Oh, wait.

452
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,220

453
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:08,980
Wait.

Climb.

459
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,860
It's John Limbo.

00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,600
Okay, good.

461
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,060
He does it all on his own.

462
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,920
I barely saw the spikes until they came into focus.

463
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:33,860

was gonna become gray for this game but then i got all um

467
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,960

00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,780
Oh, geez.

473
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,080
It's limbo clock.

474
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,940
Can I pull my boat?

475
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,300
Oh, okay, okay.

476
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,460
I have to remember the action button.

477
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,430
There we go.

478
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,650
Is this okay?

479
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,210
Be like a monkey?

480
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,750
Oh, yes.

481
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,960
It's so quiet.

482
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,700
It's like so loud and so quiet at the same time, you know?

483
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,960
This is getting scary.

484
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,380
So far, I'm feeling relaxed.

485
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,560
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

486
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,440

Or do I not know how to do that?

523
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,020
I'm the captain and I go down with this ship.

524
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,960
Oh, I don't think I know how to swim.

525
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,320
Okay, good to know.

526
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,660
You will drown.

527
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,480
Oh, cool.

528
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,780
Thanks, guys.

529
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,580
Limbo was pretty popular back when it released.

530
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,560
I feel like...

531
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,340
Um...

532
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,400
I feel like...

533
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,180
that.

534
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,630
Oh, oops.

535
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,990
I was trying to jump and push it.

536
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,210
Big VTuber game back in 2018.

537
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,070
You mean YouTuber?

538
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:19,970
I mean, there were a few VTubers back then, but big indie
game back in the day.

539
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:21,970
Push!

540
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,170
Push!

541
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,350
Oh my gosh, wait.

542
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,050
Oh, no!

543
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,490
No!

544
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,230
This kid has the lung capacity of an ant.

545
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,840
Come on.

546
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,300
Come on.

547
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh, no, no, no.

548
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,000
Please.

549
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,100
Am I going to die?

550
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,920
Oh, my gosh.

551
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,960
Okay, maybe I don't.

552
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,680
Maybe I don't.

553
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,820
I'm not a genius.

554
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,420
But ants have good lung capacity.

555
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,400
They have the lung capacity of the size of an ant.

556
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,400
Um, actually, ants are great swimmers.

557
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,580
That's a terrible comparison, Minto.

558
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,220
Think, Minto, think.

559
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,380
I can't think.

560
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,960
I have to pee!

561
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,180
I mean, I'm gonna go to the little ghosty's room.

562
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:24,700
I'll be right back.

563
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,300
I'm sorry.

564
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,920
I have to go to the little ghosty's room.

565
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,360
I'll be right back.

566
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,680
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,220
Sorry.

568
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:32,960
One second.

569
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,210
I have...

570
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,510
I have returned.

571
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,590
I have returned!

572
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,690
Hope she catch something nice.

573
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:26,990
Thanks.

574
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,110
Wishing hours fishing.

575
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:31,350
Okay.

576
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:32,470
Scatter!

577
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:32,970
No!

578
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,910
Don't leave!

579
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,170
Guys, this one's perplexing me.

580
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,970
Do I grab onto it and swim?

581
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:41,490
Nope.

582
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,730
Did you wash?

583
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,530
I always do?

584
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,790
Like, he just laid down with his fate.

585
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:56,870
Take the box to the rope.

586
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,490
Like, grab and push.

587
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,590
That's what I tried doing.

588
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,070
But she just died.

589
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,070
He gets two.

590
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,590
He takes one little step into the water.

591
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,830
He's like, I can't do it.

592
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,230
I can't do it.

593
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,050
Someone said, take it to the rope.

594
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,050
But, like, huh?

595
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,230
What rope?

596
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,450
This one over here?

597
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,550
I feel like that's kind of...

598
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,210
Like this.

599
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,920
You know, I did see this, but I didn't think it was
anything.

600
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,420
Oh no, the platforming begins.

601
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,080
Oh gosh, okay.

602
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,290
I have to press just like a second early.

603
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,490
Oh my gosh.

604
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:11,750
Now that I think about it, can you I can, but I would not
say that I am a strong swimmer.

605
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:17,950
But if you push me in, I will not drown.

606
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,810
There's a special thing there.

607
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,110
Yes.

608
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,570
Pull yourself up.

609
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,490
Oh, exploration off the ground.

610
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,590
Altitude is attitude.

611
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,710
Dude.

612
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,390
Okay, nice.

613
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,770
Rip Eggie.

614
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,290
Sorry, Eggie.

615
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,910
Oh, thank goodness.

616
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,110
Thought I was gonna die.

617
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,770
Fall damage.

618
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:00,380
Okay.

619
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,640
Companion crate.

620
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,080
Maybe I could jump from here.

621
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,840
Thank you!

622
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,280
We fight it!

623
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,080
Yeah!

624
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,050
Let's get...

625
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:24,310
Oh.

626
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,770
Okay.

627
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,550
I will remember that.

628
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:33,430
Oh!

629
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:42,900
Oh!

630
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,400
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

631
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,300
Wowza!

632
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,420
Oh my gosh!

633
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,040
Very cool.

634
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,620
Um...

635
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,760
What around here?

636
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,200
Can I grab his arm.

637
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,560
Bring them spiders!

638
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:15,830
Nope.

639
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:19,750
Maybe if I...

640
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,950
Oh!

641
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:20,390
Oh!

642
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:20,850
Oh!

643
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,010
I think he...

644
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:22,230
Oh!

645
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,730
We got a... We got... Okay.

646
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,270
Nice.

647
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:30,740
Wait.

648
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,240
Oh!

649
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,340
That was a little unfortunate.

650
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,880
Oopsie.

651
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,760
Okay.

652
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,440
Jump!

653
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,700
Okay, nice.

654
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,020
Okay.

655
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:43,780
Good job, kid.

656
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,400
All right, now push.

657
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,760
How?

658
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,740
That's a great question.

659
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,160
It was, like, right here.

660
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:57,590
Oh.

661
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:00,510
Hello.

662
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,370
Yeah, do your thing.

663
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,030
Oh.

664
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,150
Okay.

665
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:16,830
Yeah!

666
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,830
Oh, do I have to do it again?

667
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,610
Okay, strike one.

668
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,640
He never learned.

669
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:31,980
Ah!

670
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,540
I never learned.

671
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,650
Oh my god.

672
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:00,450
Yeah.

673
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,390
Caught you talking smack.

674
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,370
True, actually.

675
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,010
Literally.

676
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,990
Got karma immediately.

677
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:11,790
Okay, now run.

678
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:12,370
Run, run.

679
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,920
Leave, you fowl beast!

680
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,160
Good job, thank you!

681
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,480
Yeah!

682
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,240
Oh.

683
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,180
We're going in.

684
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,840
It's so hairy in here, no?

685
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,510
So hairy.

686
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,990
The aesthetic of this game is crazy.

687
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,770
Oh, those are...

688
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:05,930
Uh-oh.

689
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:06,590
Wait.

690
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,310
little tough to move.

691
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:09,790
Uh-oh.

692
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,390
Uh-oh.

693
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,890
Uh-oh.

694
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:13,530
Oh, gosh.

695
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,790
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

696
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:16,790
No, no, no,

697
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:20,510
no, no, no, no.

698
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,630
Like, it's over for me.

699
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,710
Wait, I'm still alive.

700
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,070
Oh, no, I'm not.

701
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:29,770
Yes, I am.

702
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:30,670
He's taking me?

703
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:32,730
Oh, he's gonna eat me.

704
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:35,750
He's... Frodo?

705
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,630
Oh, I have no Sam to help me.

706
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,870
They just really had to play that one up, huh?

707
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:47,770
Unless?

708
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:50,010
Unless?

709
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,610
Oh, I can wiggle.

710
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:54,510
Come on.

711
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:55,230
Come on.

712
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,150
Come on.

713
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,250
Come on.

714
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:58,490
Come on.

715
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,130

719
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:13,930
Yes.

00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,110

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,740
Thank you all for the gift.

747
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,580
Oh, gosh.

748
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,980
I hate being a worm.

749
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,540
If I become a worm, don't love me.

750
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,700
Put me out of my misery.

751
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,160
Literally forgot I said I'd give 50 subs if I blew on.

752
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,000
the tail!

753
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,860
Okay, all right we gotta push it over this little hill, and
then we gotta hop away.

754
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,940
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, oh, okay.

755
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,500
I knew it was gonna happen as soon as I saw the tree
starting to come down.

756
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,520
I was like, this is gonna be bad news, players for me.

757
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,720
Take off, take you!

758
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, oh, oh, okay.

759
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,740
We could do this, we could do this.

760
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,640
We could do this, we could do this.

761
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,300
We could do this.

762
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,600
We could do this.

763
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,500
We could do this.

764
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,020
We could do this.

765
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,520
We could do this.

766
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,000
We could do this.

767
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,500
We could do this.

768
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,300
We could do this.

769
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,300
Oh no no no no no.

770
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:13,840
We could do this.

771
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,440
Faster.

772
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,180
Faster.

773
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:15,500
Faster maybe.

774
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,220
Faster.

775
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:16,960
Faster.

776
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:19,520
We could.

777
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,860
They just had to add the little element of suspense and...

778
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,300
Oh god.

779
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,120
Oh golly.

780
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:28,780
Oh golly me.

781
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:29,560
Oh geez.

782
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,100
Oh geez.

783
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,140
Ah!

784
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:32,240
Ah!

785
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:41,330
Get up.

786
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,690
Get up.

787
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,290
Hopping away to safety.

788
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,870
Look at me.

789
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,130
What the?

790
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,930
Are you a real?

791
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,040
I didn't think so.

792
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:05,050
You!

793
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,650
Son of a gun.

794
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,880
We made it.

795
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,720
We made it.

796
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,380
We're out of limbo.

797
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,240
Oh, gosh.

798
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:27,520
Okay.

799
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,520
Nice.

800
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,360
Nice one.

801
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,520
Nice one.

802
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,480
Yes, nice one.

803
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,020
Oh, gosh.

804
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,960
There's a body back there.

805
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,320
I wasn't sure what to do.

806
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,040
I just let it happen.

807
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,220
It's a long time fandom you and Nimi.

808
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,280
It's awesome to hear that you all hung out and had fun
together.

809
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,360
So excited to see what you and Phoebe and Vicky
accomplished.

810
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,280
Thank you!

811
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,460
Thank you so much!

812
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,400
Thank you!

813
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,000
Wow!

814
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,960
Oh, there we go, nice.

815
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:07,260
Okay.

816
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,060
So it cracks, and I go back!

817
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:11,960
Oh, that was close.

818
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,720
That was so stinking close.

819
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:19,700
Okay.

820
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,320
From here, do I just do a leap of faith?

821
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:31,720
Uh...

822
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,180
Leap of faith!

823
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,500
Okay.

824
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,840
Oh.

825
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,180
Oh, jeez.

826
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,340
Okay, okay.

827
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,960
That's what was gonna happen.

828
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,620
Whoop.

829
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,800
Um, huh.

830
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,340
I think I just have to jump again, maybe?

831
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,180
Right after?

832
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,020
But to where?

833
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,380
Oh!

834
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:57,940
What?

835
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,440
Because it opens that up.

836
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,640
Oh, I heard the setting up these traps!

837
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,140
Right!

838
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,840
They need to get, like, in Minecraft's dot.

839
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:21,340
Yeah, the rock opens the platform, so I wonder if I can...

840
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,600
I don't feel like I can jump high enough, though.

841
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,340
Let's try.

842
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:28,880
Jump!

843
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,560
Ah, you apparently can.

844
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:33,800
Awesome.

845
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,600
God, that's such a low blow.

846
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,500
low blow.

847
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,340
This game is pissing me off.

848
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,400
Jump!

849
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,420
Jump!

850
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,240
Oh, she okay.

851
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,320
Alright, nice.

852
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,860
The music is scary.

853
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,900
That was evil, wasn't it?

854
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,160
Not a...

855
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,620
spitter.

856
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,080
But acts like one.

857
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:21,940
We're running.

858
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,640
Hey you!

859
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,520
Well, we found our culprit.

860
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,060
Of who's...

861
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,090
Of who's setting up these traps.

862
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:38,270
I feel like this game is atmospheric version of I wanna be
the guy or cat Mario.

863
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,710
But I don't know that one.

864
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,230
What's that?

865
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:53,720
Oh!

866
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,840
Oh, it's on fire?

867
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,240
Is this a rage game?

868
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,340
It can't be.

869
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,320
Oh.

870
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,720
Oh, wait, but they have to go into the water, right?

871
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:24,130
Okay.

872
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,260
But he keeps throwing stuff at me.

873
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,980
This one's not as big.

874
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,120
I can go.

875
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,280
Hey, you!

876
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,460
Oh, there's two of them.

877
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,020
What the heck?

878
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,160
I'll get your ass.

879
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,540
I'll get your ass right now.

880
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,860
I'll get your ass right now.

881
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:52,760
Come here.

882
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,840
Come here, punk.

883
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,200
Come here, punks.

884
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:57,840
Come on.

885
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:58,840
I'll square up.

886
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,900
I know action, but...

887
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,300
Oh, they're hanging people.

888
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:02,920
Wait a second.

889
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,060
Wait, I don't think I would hang out with these people.

890
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:05,780
Wait.

891
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,160
Wait, I think this might be bad.

892
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,080
Oh.

893
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,520
I knew that was going to happen.

894
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,240
Is he going to do it right now?

895
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,900
Yeah, he does it early.

896
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:22,760
Or...

897
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,600
Oh, sometimes it just works and sometimes not.

898
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,580
Oh my god.

899
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:28,620
What the hell?

900
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,340
He was still climbing up it!

901
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,590
It's automatic.

902
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:42,230
Okay, okay.

903
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:46,090
Is it something that I trigger or like is it this?

904
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:47,030
Nope.

905
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:49,810
Okay.

906
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,240
There we go.

907
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:03,960
Oh, there's

908
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,380
a...

909
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,020
Did you

910
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:16,640
do?

911
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,620
There was a second one!

912
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:19,240
No!

913
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,060
Oh my gosh.

914
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,260
I can't duck in this game, so...

915
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,520
Oh my god, please.

916
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,000
I...

917
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,560
Trigger!

918
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,810
No one expects the second trap!

919
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,530
They're so thorough!

920
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:56,580
Evil!

921
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,020
Evil!

922
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,130
Jigsaw level threat!

923
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,730
Literally, they're just like, we're gonna get you one way or
another.

924
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,600
Oh my gosh!

925
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,760
I don't know.

926
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:30,800
and then i just see my head is blocking it but he just set
up another trap over there okay run

927
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:44,100
you have to beat the game in less than five deaths for an
achievement well good thing we're not a hundred percenting

928
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:53,240
it this character can crouch no i can't I don't think so.

929
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,300
Only jump.

930
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:57,580
Zigzag.

931
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,420
Oh yeah, let's try.

932
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:01,940
Ah!

933
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,200
Let's try again.

934
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:05,700
Maybe?

935
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,850
It's too low.

936
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:12,030
Maybe...

937
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:12,370
Hold on.

938
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,510
I think it has to be pretty...

939
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:17,850
There we go.

940
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,310
There we go.

941
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:19,230
There.

942
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,490
Wait, isn't it supposed to be?

943
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,810
Wait, I think maybe I can climb up this now.

944
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,670
I don't think I can go that way.

945
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:30,570
Hoey!

946
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,450
Always good to have a second trap.

947
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,950
Unless you have a bad memory.

948
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:37,910
Hoey!

949
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:44,030
They're gonna throw more fire tires at me.

950
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,290
Don't do it, please.

951
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:49,090
I'm friend!

952
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,270
I just... I don't even know why I'm here.

953
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,470
Oh my gosh!

954
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,230
It killed him!

955
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,090
Wait, uh, oh.

956
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,210
I thought it's gonna kill me!

957
01:05:58,950 --> 01:05:59,230
Oh!

958
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,090
Oh!

959
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,590
I was already drowning!

960
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,390
Can't you just let me die?

961
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,960
Uh, do I jump here?

962
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,900
No, I drown again.

963
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,420
Um, can I push this?

964
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,560
Yes.

965
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,200
Okay.

966
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,400
Oh my god, please.

967
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,140
Grab it!

968
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,000
Okay, thank you.

969
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,280
Keep going!

970
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,060
Keep going!

971
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,160
The spiders are like way too realistic.

972
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,180
It's so scary, you know?

973
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,300
Oh no no no, wait.

974
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:35,820
Uh oh.

975
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,060
And... oh geez.

976
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,460
Wait, uh oh, wait.

977
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,440
Do I need him to...

978
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:42,660
Ha!

979
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:44,880
Oh my gosh, please!

980
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:45,380
Pull up!

981
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:45,660
Pull up!

982
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:45,980
Pull up!

983
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:48,800
Ehehe!

984
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,140
Please, please, please!

985
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:54,320
Oh.

986
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,200
Dang it, I was so close.

987
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,060
Oh, from the beginning?

988
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,660
In the beginning.

989
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,860
In the beginning.

990
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:09,740
Hoi.

991
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,260
All right.

992
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,140
Hoi.

993
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,180
Hoi.

994
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,220
Mr. Spider, Mr. Spider.

995
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,680
I was saying that to myself just now.

996
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:28,540
Hoi.

997
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,240
Oh, no, no, no, no.

998
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,520
Kill me.

999
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:34,700
Take it.

1000
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,180
The jump is like a little slow sometimes, you know?

1001
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,980
It's not like a crisp jump.

1002
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,820
It's like a very slow.

1003
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,860
So brutal with it, too, I know.

1004
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,060
Yeah, it is weighty.

1005
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,880
Yeah, it's very weighty jump.

1006
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,400
Come on.

1007
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,360

01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:35,820

1009
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,260
No, it's gonna crush him!

1010
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:53,720
That kid got eight.

1011
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,540
He got devoured.

1012
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,780
Well, actually the spider doesn't even eat them.

1013
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,040
He just kills to kill.

1014
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,460
Like a psychopath.

1015
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,100
This game is nightmare fuel.

1016
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:08,880
It's quite...

1017
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,120
If you're afraid of spiders, definitely cannot play this
game.

1018
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,500
Uh-oh.

1019
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,440
Oh, I learned.

1020
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,460
I learned not to trust the bottom.

1021
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,230
You're still at it?

1022
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,330
Oh, he has one leg left.

1023
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,430
One leg yet.

1024
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,010
Wait, I think I need him though.

1025
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,910
How are you alive?

1026
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:48,650
Don't you dare.

1027
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:50,050
Don't you dare.

1028
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:52,790
Oh my gosh.

1029
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,990
Did that get me?

1030
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:57,850
Oh, it did.

1031
01:09:59,090 --> 01:09:59,550
Wow.

1032
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:07,930
Oh, he could just knock me over and that kills me.

1033
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,250
Okay, okay.

1034
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:13,330
Uh, let's see.

1035
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:15,770
It's tenacious, guys.

1036
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:16,850
Yeah, for real.

1037
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:17,910
It definitely...

1038
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:19,590
Is that...

1039
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:19,710
Oh.

1040
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,630
Oh!

1041
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:21,150
Oh!

1042
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,990
I got your arm.

1043
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:26,490
Oh!

1044
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,530
Oh my god.

1045
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:35,650
Oh my god.

1046
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,530
Just gonna roll your little body over.

1047
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,750
Wait, how do I...

1048
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,890
Can I jump on top of him?

1049
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,630
Okay, yeah, good.

1050
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,270
We're gonna push your body.

1051
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:53,740
How could you?

1052
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,460
It's survival of the fittest, baby.

1053
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,380
Yeah!

1054
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:02,580
Survive.

1055
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,180
I want to take this and use it as like...

1056
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,380
like a way to protect myself.

1057
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,540
Like a hairy lemon.

1058
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,020
So a lemon?

1059
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,200
Hey, other kids!

1060
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,880
You're gonna play nice.

1061
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,540
Oh my god, there's a kid in prison.

1062
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,520
Y'all right up there?

1063
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,290
Why do they have this, like, Lord of the Fly society?

1064
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:33,930
What's going on?

1065
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:36,690
Spear?

1066
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,170
Yeah.

1067
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:38,770
Kiwi?

1068
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:40,150
Yes.

1069
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,360
Am I right in there?

1070
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,140
Wait.

1071
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:50,960
Whoa!

1072
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,880
I don't know what I needed that for, but...

1073
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,650
Oh, right here.

1074
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,780
How do you feel about eating kiwi skin?

1075
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,320
I do sometimes.

1076
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,420
Honestly, kiwi is so delicious.

1077
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,020
I used to be a big kiwi.

1078
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:26,100
So, it really, I feel like I've been missing out on kiwi for
so long in my afterlife.

1079
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:34,100
Because I would taste like the artificial, like, strawberry
kiwi flavor stuff.

1080
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,240
And I would be like, I love strawberries.

1081
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:40,740
But kiwis are disgusting because I don't like the taste of
the strawberry kiwi.

1082
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,140

What did you say?

1108
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,770
Guys are talking about the fruit, not the tiny birds.

1109
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:43,730
I was listening to her about Vin talking about devouring
their skin.

1110
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:46,990
No.

1111
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,810
Oh, there we go.

1112
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:52,470
Nice and easy.

1113
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,220
That guy really... Oh.

1114
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,580
That's the thing.

1115
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,420
So I have to avoid these.

1116
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:08,360
Oh, do you hear them trying to get at my brain?

1117
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,600
Um, unlucky for you, there's nothing in there.

1118
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:18,250
Oh, is this one?

1119
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:21,710
No.

1120
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,620
You just surfed on a kid.

1121
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,220
Great work.

1122
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,940
This is why you're the best boss.

1123
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,440
This looks like a button.

1124
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,480
It wasn't a button, but, you know.

1125
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,200
Uh-huh.

1126
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:48,980
Oh gosh, that's fast.

1127
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,420
Is the game blinking or am I inside?

1128
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:59,520
There's like a, there's like a, like an effect that does
make it kind of flicker.

1129
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,980
There's only Koharu in that skull of hers.

1130
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:04,860
So true.

1131
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,860
So, so true.

1132
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:10,820
Yeah.

1133
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:14,880
Unfortunately, this game...

1134
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,720
The game has like extremely minimal settings.

1135
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,180
So I can only control the brightness.

1136
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,200
And that's about it.

1137
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,440
So sorry if it bothers you.

1138
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,940
I can unfortunately do nothing about it.

1139
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,500
I have to like get in there.

1140
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:44,310
Ah, I see.

1141
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:45,070
Okay.

1142
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,090
Watch this be the opposite.

1143
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:52,910
Uh-huh.

1144
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:54,930
Uh-huh.

1145
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:57,170
I know your games.

1146
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,290
I know your games.

1147
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,380
Wait, is that the kid right there?

1148
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,600
Is that the one that I've been following?

1149
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:14,500
Oh!

1150
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:15,580
Oh.

1151
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,840
Wait, now they're chasing after me.

1152
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:19,540
Oh, shoot.

1153
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,100
Okay.

1154
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,480
Oh, they're dying.

1155
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:22,500
Okay.

1156
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,500
Why are they...

1157
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,320
Why is everybody coming after me?

1158
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,060
Why are they all like all these factions?

1159
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,400
Freaky.

1160
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,920
What is going on?

1161
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,740
You think they know their own area?

1162
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,840
Who built the traps?

1163
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,360
Yeah, they don't even...

1164
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,100
Maybe they got them mixed up.

1165
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,680
Maybe they couldn't remember which one was the button one
and which one was the...

1166
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,200
Was the sensor one, you know?

1167
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,500
Where does this go?

1168
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,520
Does it drop down?

1169
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,770
Oh, that doesn't look very good.

1170
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:16,390
Oh, gosh.

1171
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:17,630
Oh, keep it going.

1172
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:18,570
Keep going.

1173
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:19,670
Don't stop.

1174
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,950
Keep going.

1175
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,480
This was a mobile game.

1176
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:28,840
Seriously?

1177
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:29,920
Is that old?

1178
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:41,030
I don't know what this is for.

1179
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:47,030
Oh.

1180
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:48,830
Oh, it was...

1181
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:50,590
I think for this...

1182
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:53,030
This guy here...

1183
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:54,610
I see.

1184
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:56,890
Oh, that sucks.

1185
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,440
Well, which do I do first?

1186
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,170
This is my question.

1187
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,910
And what is the cart for?

1188
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,120
Think, Minky, think.

1189
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,880
You're asking a lot of me, you know.

1190
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,180
Now, this is a puzzle.

1191
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,840
Yeah, this is a puzzle.

1192
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:54,100
Does what this one it It's actually I feel quite fast So I
think this one would be the one that we do

1193
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:06,660
Second Oh I'm just like

1194
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:14,640
Maybe I jump on this and like kind of ride it

1195
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,300
Because I can't pass through...

1196
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,100
Oh, there we go.

1197
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:28,490
Oh, whoops.

1198
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:29,470
No, no, don't!

1199
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:29,930
No!

1200
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,380
Because I can't go through the spikes, I'll die.

1201
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,120
I'll test it.

1202
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:47,790
He just grazed them.

1203
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:53,910
He just grazed them and was like, No, I'm out.

1204
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:57,610
I'm out, I'm out.

1205
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,050
I think we can get this to catapult me.

1206
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:05,870
Maybe.

1207
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,730
It's a very sharp saw.

1208
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:11,170
Yeah, right?

1209
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,390
Gently stroked by the gears.

1210
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,200
It looks more like...

1211
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:19,610
It looks like, um...

1212
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:25,370
Oh my gosh, like a skincare device or something that I've
seen before.

1213
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:33,330
Okay.

1214
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:38,920
Yeah, some sort of derma roller.

1215
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:39,520
Exactly!

1216
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,400

How am I supposed to make this launch, man?

01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,980
Tie it to the cart.

1221
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,220

01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:29,430
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1260
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:30,710
Dang it.

1261
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:33,150
We

1262
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:36,800
died.

1263
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:37,480
My bad.

1264
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:38,700
Ah!

1265
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,340
We have the idea, though.

1266
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,860
I just have to execute it properly.

1267
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:45,340
Oh, wait.

1268
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:45,640
Hold on.

1269
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,940
We need this here first.

1270
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:47,640
Nope.

1271
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:48,480
Please move.

1272
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:50,760
We need you down here.

1273
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:52,640

01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,070
We have the idea.

1278
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:11,470
Okay.

1279
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,120

Okay.

1284
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:24,600
I wish I could do, um, like a safe state right here.

1285
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,520
Go,

1286
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,340

Yeah!

1290
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,720
Gross, gross, gross!

1291
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,060
What is this?

1292
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,900
Oh, a little frog.

1293
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,200
What is this?

1294
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:51,200
Why is it so stinky?

1295
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:56,600
Ooh.

1296
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,420
Wait, is this the possession?

1297
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,080
Yeah.

1298
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:04,400
Oh, wow, wait, I can't...

1299
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,820
Wow, wait, this is so cool.

1300
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,520
Oh, I can jump though.

1301
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,260
I can jump.

1302
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:11,620
Possessed me.

1303
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,340
Possessed me to go into the right direction.

1304
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:17,790
Oh, let's go.

1305
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:22,570
Wait, I'm possessed, but I'm like still controlling it.

1306
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:27,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1307
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:27,910
No!

1308
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:29,370
He's gonna lead!

1309
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:29,750
No!

1310
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:36,100
Why did it, why did it wanted me to die?

1311
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,300
Huh.

1312
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:43,480
Brainworm.

1313
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,040
I can't fight my brainworms.

1314
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:45,820
you guys.

1315
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:09,950
So it like short circuits and then

1316
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,290
I control him for a bit.

1317
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:17,910
What if I stop here?

1318
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:18,790
What if I let him?

1319
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:20,690
Wait, no, no, no, turn around.

1320
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:24,890
Maybe if I just keep running.

1321
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,390
No, he's short circuits here.

1322
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:32,550
But I can kind of help facilitate how slow you go.

1323
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:34,020
So maybe they'll eat him.

1324
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,240
Ah, yeah!

1325
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:39,130
There we go.

1326
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:41,020
Awesome.

1327
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:45,920
Oh, it's the sunlight that causes them to activate.

1328
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,060
Oh, you're right.

1329
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:47,870
Yeah, yeah.

1330
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,460
Cool.

1331
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:54,700
Cool.

1332
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:00,530
Okay.

1333
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:12,590
you want that little buddy you want that buddy I'll get that
for you

1334
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:26,430
somehow count on me watch I give it to him and he turns into
like this horrifying worst creature ever

1335
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:40,030
he's gonna be like yes you gave me the mushrooms that turned
me evil Yes, it's my favorite snack.

1336
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:43,130
The mushrooms that turned me evil.

1337
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:48,570
What's this?

1338
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:52,250
Cool.

1339
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,090
Okay.

1340
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,880
Oh, here's a rope right here.

1341
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:06,360
Or sometimes I can't tell if something's in the foreground
or the background, you know.

1342
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,160
Hoi!

1343
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:09,700
Hoi!

1344
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:10,740
Hoi!

1345
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,540
He scrambled over.

1346
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:15,600
Did you get what you wanted, buddy?

1347
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:29,070
Gotcha!

1348
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:29,530
Oh!

1349
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:32,990
Almost.

1350
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:34,630
I almost had a pet.

1351
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:36,690
I almost had you, my sweet.

1352
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:39,530
Wait, that's in the background.

1353
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:43,110
Depth perception.

1354
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:45,410
Sometimes it's hard to tell in this game, though.

1355
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:47,970
Ha!

1356
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,320
I chase you.

1357
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,500
And you fall in there.

1358
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:04,800
Oh!

1359
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,040
He's a hamster!

1360
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:12,920
We're powering...

1361
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,000
The city?

1362
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:19,340
One single gerbil is powering the whole city.

1363
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,140
Insane.

1364
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:34,250
I think we need to let the water flow maybe.

1365
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:35,990
and fill this up, yeah.

1366
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:41,550
But I can't swim.

1367
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:43,490
How does that benefit me?

1368
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:46,910
Oh, there's a log!

1369
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,950
And there's...

1370
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:57,550
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wow.

1371
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:58,270
Okay, okay.

1372
01:33:58,410 --> 01:33:59,070
I gotta be fast.

1373
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,190
Hump the power.

1374
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:11,540
Oi!

1375
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,320
I can't swim.

1376
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:20,540
There's like this, that pole, like on the...

1377
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:22,120
Huh.

1378
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,560
Let's see.

1379
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:32,310
There's this right here.

1380
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:37,070
I wonder if I...

1381
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:38,010
Use it somehow.

1382
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:39,910
Oh, it's just to get me in and out.

1383
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:43,010
Huh.

1384
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:52,440
Hampto.

1385
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:55,360
Oh!

1386
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,280
Why is the log on this side?

1387
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:58,980
Wait a second.

1388
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,040
I didn't...

1389
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:02,040
Oh,

1390
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:08,760
okay.

1391
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,780
I gotta put it like...

1392
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:10,680
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1393
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:11,260
I get it.

1394
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:12,620
That's so funny.

1395
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,140
That was so weird.

1396
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,900
I can't even see it on the ground, I'll be honest.

1397
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,560
Oh, I can see it on the ground.

1398
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:29,620
We'll put you like right here.

1399
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:35,770
That should be good, maybe?

1400
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,590
The game was like, hey, dummy.

1401
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:42,970
He dies after like three seconds of no air.

1402
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:45,170
I know, he's just a baby.

1403
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,660
Okay, a one and a two and a...

1404
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:01,370
Oh, so close.

1405
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:05,210
So close.

1406
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:09,510
So close!

1407
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,390
Yeah, so far.

1408
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:18,790
Your new name should be Minto's maggots.

1409
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:19,470
Ew!

1410
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,370
That's gross.

1411
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:24,910
Or ghost brain worms.

1412
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:26,110
Oh,

01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,180

I'm just checking.

1419
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,240
I don't like this.

1420
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,720
I don't like this one bit.

1421
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,360
Can I stop it?

1422
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,240
Can I plug it up?

1423
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:02,450
Hmm.

1440
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,320
She kicked the bucket.

1441
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:11,760
I don't know, okay.

1442
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:15,400
When I was, when I first saw this puzzle,

1443
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:26,120
I thought that this lever was a crutch.

1444
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,880
Like, you know, have you ever needed crutches before?

1445
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:32,680
Oh my gosh.

1446
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:40,960
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1447
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,100
Oh gosh, that was close.

1448
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:48,790
It does look like it.

1449
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:49,470
It does, right?

1450
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:51,190
So I thought.

1451
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:52,590
Hoa!

1452
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:53,290
Nice.

1453
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:55,550
Gaming?

1454
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,070
Wait, does this keep rising?

1455
01:39:59,330 --> 01:39:59,890
Or...

1456
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,560
Um...

1457
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,400
Uh, it absolutely does.

1458
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,720
Oh, wait.

1459
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1460
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:15,860
Ah!

1461
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:20,270
I caught on a pixel!

1462
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,310
Oh!

1463
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,630
No kidding.

1464
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:31,490
Wow.

1465
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:34,850
I got caught on a pixel.

1466
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:38,930
That's really unfortunate.

1467
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,780
Go, go, go, go.

1468
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,020
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

1469
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,400
Pixel imperfect.

1470
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:57,700
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1471
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,240
My dummy ass.

1472
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,240
in a limbo?

1473
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,380
I don't know.

1474
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,680
I'm not very flexible at all.

1475
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:17,860
You would think because of my ectoplasm, like, it'd be fine,
but I am unfortunately not so flexible.

1476
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:22,400
We'll go a little bit more just for good measure, okay?

1477
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,240
La la la la la.

1478
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,600
Okay, good.

1479
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:34,460
I was gonna say my thing is too heavy!

1480
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:36,500
Oh gosh, wait.

1481
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:37,860
What's going on here?

1482
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:38,340
Ah!

1483
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,820
No, I'm gonna die.

1484
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:41,780
I'm gonna die.

1485
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:44,260
Okay, good.

1486
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:47,660
Is this still rising?

1487
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:48,340
No, okay.

1488
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,280
And jump!

1489
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:52,820
Oh!

1490
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:55,300
Nice.

1491
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,420
Great checkpoint.

1492
01:41:57,540 --> 01:42:02,100
Yeah, the game is very generous with the checkpoints at
least, so...

1493
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:06,120
I will be thankful for that at the very least.

1494
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,020
What the...

1495
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:10,800
What was that?

1496
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,360
Starting to get hungry, guys.

1497
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,280
Oh, the water is rising.

1498
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:18,340
Water is rising.

1499
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,140
Something getting low.

1500
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,300
Hold on.

1501
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:25,980
I want to check.

1502
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:26,400
Okay.

1503
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:27,700
Ah, okay.

1504
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,440
So there's that balloon thing.

1505
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:36,920
Which I think we use right here?

1506
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,320
Perhaps.

1507
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:42,360
Not quite sure.

1508
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,540
I have some croquettes I bought.

1509
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,100
I'm gonna eat those.

1510
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:49,420
The buoy.

1511
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,660
Oh, is it because I'm on it?

1512
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,560
Wait, did I just ruin that?

1513
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:55,800
Wait.

1514
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,200
Oh, no, I need to pull it!

1515
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,800
I'm a dummy dumb, sorry.

1516
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:01,960
Just kill me.

1517
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:02,700
Just kill me.

1518
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:04,820
Me!

1519
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:06,380
Thank you so much for the tiny kitten!

1520
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:07,320
Thank you!

1521
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:14,160
I thought it was going to break it for some reason.

1522
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:21,210
And then...

1523
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:22,900
And then I stand on it?

1524
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:26,530
Oh.

1525
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:30,210
Like, over here?

1526
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:32,390
I use it?

1527
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:35,310
Come here, come here.

1528
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:38,330
Come on, oh, let me jump on-

1529
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:45,990
This one's tricky.

1530
01:43:52,110 --> 01:44:00,150
like it feel like i oh no why'd you do that i feel like i
need it to wait i guess i could just oh but i need to push

1531
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:07,670
it over here no right i'm not sure how to get it over there
without avoiding the water yeah that's how i feel

1532
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:25,390
unless for some reason it comes over here on its own maybe
it's designed to do that it is not

1533
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:48,660
I'm not done with that door oh okay I think I get it then
when it jumps up I close it right oh stop doing that so I it

1534
01:44:48,660 --> 01:45:02,220
whoa whoa whoa my bad it does the bounce and then I close it
real fast right okay and there we go okay then I push it

1535
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,060
over into here, and then I run.

1536
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,560
And then I go up here.

1537
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:10,020
Hoi!

1538
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,100
Ami!

1539
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,340
Welcome back!

1540
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:14,260
Thank you!

1541
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:16,440
Or welcome too!

1542
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:17,040
Thank you!

1543
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,240
Wait.

1544
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:20,600
Yeah.

1545
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:22,680
Or, no?

1546
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,440
Ah, ah!

1547
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:27,320
Ah, I see!

1548
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,280
Oh, interesting.

1549
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:38,840
Just, like, Stinky, minky, limbo boy, allergic to bath.

1550
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,600
What are you talking about?

1551
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,140
I'm not allergic to bath.

1552
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,300
Oh, but there's a lever here.

1553
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:46,980
What does that do?

1554
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:54,990
Oh, okay.

1555
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:00,390
Minty fresh at all times.

1556
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:01,950
Exactly.

1557
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:07,690
Ooh, okay.

1558
01:46:08,890 --> 01:46:09,290
Whoa.

1559
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:10,670
Whoa.

1560
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:15,430
Oh, now I can't make it.

1561
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:15,830
Oh,

1562
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:20,140
okay.

1563
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,600
Oh, geez.

1564
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:26,180
Where am I going?

1565
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:28,600
Nowhere.

1566
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:32,140
Okay.

1567
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:33,960
Actual puzzle time.

1568
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:50,680
Okay.

1569
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:54,780
Oh.

1570
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:54,940
Oh.

1571
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:55,400
Oh.

1572
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:55,820
Oh.

1573
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,120
maybe like that's enough

1574
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:13,900
bro doesn't even attempt i know there's not even like a
flailing of the arms he's just literally like

1575
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:27,460
no give this kid i swear

1576
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:39,260
i don't even know if like me doing that is doing anything.

1577
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,820
Literally gives up.

1578
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,420
Like, you've come this far and you're just gonna give up.

1579
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:47,800
Oh.

1580
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,220
You're just gonna give up.

1581
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,720
You've come this far.

1582
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,040
He's like, I can take...

1583
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,080
I can take factions trying to kill me.

1584
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,480
I can take spiders.

1585
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,280
I can take brain worms.

1586
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:10,080
but a little bit of water is too much for me.

1587
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:20,670
Hold on, I'm going to grab my croquettes.

1588
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:22,090
They're literally right here, so.

1589
01:48:22,910 --> 01:48:26,910
Oh, no, I don't have a like a chopstick or fork or anything,
though.

1590
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:31,790
Do you guys mind if I go grab one real quick?

1591
01:48:33,950 --> 01:48:34,670
My croquette.

1592
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:38,430
I'll be right back.

1593
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:40,050
What kind did you get?

1594
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:41,110
They're just like a veggie.

1595
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:53,700
I'll be rebuke I'm hungry I'll be rebuke

1596
01:49:22,810 --> 01:49:39,490
fast so fast Wow Minto is so fast she never keeps us waiting
for too long she just does it instantly how does she do it

1597
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:50,120
she's zooming you if you saw that way I looked, I'm like
running like Bigfoot to get to the kitchen and back.

1598
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:57,690
Big steps.

1599
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,160
They were warm earlier.

1600
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,840
Now they're a little bushy.

1601
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,760
And the condensation got on my dress.

1602
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,960
And now it's touching me.

1603
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:15,920
It's cold.

1604
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,000
You want to warm them up?

1605
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:24,680
I would have to put them in, like, a air fryer or something
to make them actually kind of toasty again, you know, so.

1606
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:26,690
It's okay, though.

1607
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,020
Yummy.

1608
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,940
It's not grease, it's the water.

1609
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:46,260
Mmm.

1610
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:55,780
Yummy.

1611
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,140
Mmm, fried goodness.

1612
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,020
Okie dokie.

1613
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,800
Let's get back to it, folks.

1614
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:13,080
Hmm.

1615
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:34,910
My head is blocking part of this.

1616
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:35,570
Hold on.

1617
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:37,290
I'll go here.

1618
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:42,730
She has such a tiny head.

1619
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:47,010
Boy, I feel like I have a big head because I'm blocking
stuff.

1620
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:51,790
Food that keeps you hydrated and full.

1621
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:54,870
We're speed running.

1622
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:58,210
Hydration and food.

1623
01:51:58,770 --> 01:51:59,370
Let's go.

1624
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,320
Whoa!

1625
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:09,160
No.

1626
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:14,410
I mean, I feel like I have to use the little block, but...

1627
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:22,320
Whoa!

1628
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:29,620
Two levers.

1629
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,020
Oh wait, right.

1630
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:32,920
So maybe.

1631
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:33,880
Oh, wait.

1632
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:37,120
Oh, because we don't want to distribute the water to the
other side.

1633
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:38,260
We want to keep it here.

1634
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,640
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1635
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:43,300
We don't want to push it over there.

1636
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:44,000
Oops, my bad.

1637
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,660
Wait, did that...

1638
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:55,660
Oh, I messed up.

1639
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:56,180
My bad.

1640
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:57,820
Wait.

1641
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:01,120
Uh, I checked my day.

1642
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:01,480
Wait.

1643
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:03,420
Um, I messed up.

1644
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:03,980
Uh.

1645
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:05,980
Ah!

1646
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:09,400
Wait!

1647
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:10,300
Wait!

1648
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,280
We can fix this, I just gotta go back and then do it all
over again.

1649
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:16,200
Actually?

1650
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:19,280
Just die.

1651
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,680
Just die.

1652
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:24,980
Just die.

1653
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,680
Just die.

1654
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:29,620
.

1655
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:30,280
.

1656
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:30,380
.

1657
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:30,540
.

1658
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:31,280
.

1659
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:31,320
.

1660
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:31,780
.

1661
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:40,160
Wait.

1662
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,500
Hold on, let's try it.

1663
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,390
Let's try it.

1664
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:53,710
The worst they can say is no.

1665
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,140
Oh, yeah.

1666
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,960
See, this seems doable.

1667
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,120
Yeah!

1668
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,860
Are these brain worms?

1669
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:11,540
Squish.

1670
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:26,430

in through my ears and start munching and crunching actually

1679
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:05,480
Oh, I did it again, but...

1680
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:08,560
It doesn't change control unless it's in the sunlight.

1681
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:11,960
Hooray!

1682
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:16,500
No!

1683
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,120
That's not the name!

1684
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:19,320
Stop it!

1685
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:22,700
Your eye blues!

1686
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,680
Well, there is sunlight back where we can.

1687
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,160
Up there, that's right.

1688
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:34,820
If I use the box to jump...

1689
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:34,980
Oh!

1690
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,560
I missed... Oh, come on!

1691
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:38,680
Die,

1692
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:43,860
die, die, die, die.

1693
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:44,160
Okay.

1694
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:51,440
Oh, why is you messing up now?

1695
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:55,460
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

1696
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,120
Okay.

1697
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,620
Maybe Winnie's facing that way.

1698
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:02,320
All right, there we go.

1699
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:03,460
Okay, okay.

1700
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:05,720
Oh, that's not why I went.

1701
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:06,060
There we go.

1702
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:07,400
Okay.

1703
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:10,240
All right.

1704
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:10,940
We need this.

1705
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,060
all the way to the edge.

1706
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:14,920
Take...

1707
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:15,840
Possess me!

1708
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:18,500
Okay.

1709
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:25,680
Control!

1710
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:29,100
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1711
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:30,580
Alrighty.

1712
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,380
Is that a ladder I can take or...

1713
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,100
I sure hope so.

1714
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:36,740
Okay, good.

1715
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:39,700
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1716
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:40,860
Alright, we're going up.

1717
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,080
We're going up!

1718
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:44,020
Boop, boop!

1719
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:50,380
Oh,

1720
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:59,660
this part's a pain in my side.

1721
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:03,580
Don't do it.

1722
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:04,240
There we go.

1723
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:08,740
Oh.

1724
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:18,950
You're doing good, though.

1725
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:19,330
You got this.

1726
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:20,910
Thank you!

1727
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:28,310
I got my own little brain buddy.

1728
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:31,630
That's my brain buddy.

1729
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:36,650
He makes me go a little sideways.

1730
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:41,250
I always wanted a brain buddy.

1731
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:42,730
Do I have to wait?

1732
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:44,050
I think it's okay now.

1733
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:47,550
Here's my brain buddy.

1734
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:52,370
Nice.

1735
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:53,990
Oh, nice.

1736
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:54,850
Nice.

1737
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:57,530
Oh, wait.

1738
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:58,370
Where do I go from here?

1739
01:58:59,550 --> 01:58:59,690
Wait.

1740
01:59:01,110 --> 01:59:01,590
Wait.

1741
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:03,230
Wait.

1742
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:04,470
Uh.

1743
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:07,390
Oh, the water's getting higher?

1744
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:11,510
Where do I go from here?

1745
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:14,490
If I go to...

1746
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:28,290
Oh, is it gonna spit out something that I can use to float
on?

1747
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,400
Uh-huh.

1748
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:43,890
Wait, I see it!

1749
01:59:44,490 --> 01:59:45,490
I see it!

1750
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:47,630
Yes, it does!

1751
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:49,830
Wait, why can't I jump?

1752
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:52,390
Oh, wait, I can only go to the left!

1753
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:53,930
Wait, is...

1754
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:54,310
No!

1755
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:56,330
No, you stupid kid!

1756
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:00,390
Ah!

1757
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:06,850
Oh my gosh, okay.

1758
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,130
Oh, what a place to put me back in, huh?

1759
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:12,070
Can I go...

1760
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,010
Oh, geez, okay.

1761
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:20,130
Oh, what?

1762
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:23,210
Maybe I can go.

1763
02:00:25,190 --> 02:00:27,250
Can I get the box at least?

1764
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:31,150
No, I can't do anything.

1765
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:33,810
Limbo.

1766
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:39,350
This is the key where you launch arrows at your arms and
legs.

1767
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:43,150
Can I put the...

1768
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:44,970
Be on the side of your car?

1769
02:00:45,090 --> 02:00:46,470
Of course, I'd be honored.

1770
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:50,870
There's a light there, though.

1771
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:55,480
Oh, I guess...

1772
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,040
Okay, we have to be speed.

1773
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:02,560
Because we have to get back to the light while it's rising.

1774
02:01:09,730 --> 02:01:11,170
Super fast.

1775
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:16,120
Hoi!

1776
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:17,560
Okay.

1777
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:18,940
Now we wait.

1778
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:21,240
Now we are patient.

1779
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:23,680
Cachow?

1780
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:24,780
Cachow.

1781
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,360
Oh, and they're going to eat them.

1782
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:31,820
They're going to...

1783
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:32,900
I see them up there.

1784
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:34,940
The little guys.

1785
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:40,500
Okay, now I have to wait and not walk into the spikes.

1786
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:42,940
It is once again us being patient.

1787
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:44,280
And go.

1788
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:45,880
Oh, my gosh.

1789
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:46,880
Oh, God.

1790
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:48,840
Eat it.

1791
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:50,280
Nice.

1792
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:50,900
Yay!

1793
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:53,560
We regain control.

1794
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,160
Oh, um...

1795
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,860
Oh, is this still rising?

1796
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:07,560
Not really.

1797
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:09,680
Oh, but I guess I can't go over that way.

1798
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:13,500
Onwards.

1799
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:15,320
But I want to see what's over here.

1800
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:18,960
Am I the only curious one?

1801
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:19,900
Is it just me?

1802
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:23,180
I love these Minecraft fall into the water, you're fine.

1803
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:26,220
Wait!

1804
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,280
Okay, I give up.

1805
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:28,580
I give up, I give up, I give up.

1806
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,780
Onwards and upwards.

1807
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,380
Oh, that was a big jump.

1808
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:42,640
Are we gonna find nice people?

1809
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:45,700
A town!

1810
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:52,000
Huh!

1811
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:03,360
Literally gives up.

1812
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:03,680
Oh,

1813
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:11,620
they, it's a fake out.

1814
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:13,160
They make you think it's gonna fall.

1815
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:21,370
Oh!

1816
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:22,390
No!

1817
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:24,430
Give me an H!

1818
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:28,550
I thought I was...

1819
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:30,990
I feel like I'm supposed to jump up on the...

1820
02:03:30,990 --> 02:03:31,350
Okay.

1821
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:36,840
Crazy.

1822
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,560
Sound effects.

1823
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:43,360
A-T-O-T-T-O!

1824
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:45,820
That's okay.

1825
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,300
Can I climb the H?

1826
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,180
Oh, jeez.

1827
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:57,900
H-O-T-T.

1828
02:04:05,770 --> 02:04:06,310
Oh, gosh.

1829
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:07,510
I just have to keep...

1830
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:09,430
I have to run and run and run.

1831
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:11,430
Run and run.

1832
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:17,140
Oh, I thought it would.

1833
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:17,720
Okay.

1834
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:29,940
So close.

1835
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:36,900
Oh, Jiao.

1836
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:40,220
You can take me hard to go.

1837
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:44,600
Oh, I think I'm not going to make it.

1838
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:46,120
I'm not gonna make it!

1839
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:47,980
Oh, she made it!

1840
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,180
Oh,

1841
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:55,380
oh, oh, oh, no, no, why did I do that?

1842
02:04:58,820 --> 02:05:00,380
I overcorrected too hard.

1843
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:06,600
What people do when they drive cars even?

1844
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:08,080
Oh, wait, I wasn't ready.

1845
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:08,560
My bad.

1846
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:09,860
They overcorrect.

1847
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:11,680
Three, two, one.

1848
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:11,980

I think I go from the O.

1859
02:06:28,670 --> 02:06:29,070
Yeah!

1860
02:06:29,390 --> 02:06:29,830

Yeah!

1864
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:50,320
You can yell at me too if I'm in the way of you guys seeing
some of the puzzles.

1865
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,520
and scoots around easy.

1866
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:56,990
Acing it.

1867
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:58,870
I might be a gamer.

1868
02:07:01,450 --> 02:07:02,750
I might be a bit of a gamer.

1869
02:07:05,210 --> 02:07:06,190
This L is gonna break.

1870
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:11,030

1874
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:22,410
Your Honor.

1875
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:23,590

Oh.

1880
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:14,440
They break it themselves.

1881
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:17,480
My reflex is unmatched.

1882
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:20,120
Oh!

1883
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:21,180
Oh, okay.

1884
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:21,860
We're fine.

1885
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:26,060
Oh, no!

1886
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:27,720
I see another worm!

1887
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:30,920
I see another worm!

1888
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:32,340
What's over here?

1889
02:08:40,850 --> 02:08:41,610
Alright!

1890
02:08:42,330 --> 02:08:44,170
I love get crushed simulator.

1891
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:44,450
Woo!

1892
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:49,610
Yeah, I love getting crushed.

1893
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:52,270
I'm eating some more.

1894
02:08:58,780 --> 02:09:03,970
I've never had this place as croquettes before, but they're
delicious.

1895
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:16,560
So we remember the sunlight is here, everybody.

1896
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,220
The sunlight.

1897
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:26,060
Sunlight.

1898
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:29,380
Come here, little brain worm.

1899
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:33,080
Are you gonna make me think about Snake and Ocelot again?

1900
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:36,580
Oh, Lolli Lolli Lolli Lolli Lolli Lolli.

1901
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,240
Oh, I get it.

1902
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:38,980
I had to do that.

1903
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:45,500
I didn't even think about it, but I would have gotten
crushed by the thing if I hadn't done this before, like done

1904
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:47,520
it first, so good thing.

1905
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,930
We would have gotten crushed and died.

1906
02:09:56,010 --> 02:09:57,670
That's how much of a genius I am.

1907
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:59,870
things without even thinking.

1908
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:06,870
No one needs to make.

1909
02:10:08,150 --> 02:10:08,830
It's true.

1910
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:10,510
I'll just think of it all on my own.

1911
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:12,170
Almost every night.

1912
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:22,010
I think it's funny that some people think that maybe I only
like Metal Gear because of Yowie.

1913
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:23,550
But that's not even the case.

1914
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:26,590
I feel like maybe Yowie is like...

1915
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:30,510
Like it's fun.

1916
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:40,250
like in Metal Gear for me, but it might even be like one of
the least reasons that I like it.

1917
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:42,110
Yeah, it's like a bonus.

1918
02:10:42,270 --> 02:10:42,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1919
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:48,440
I actually like it for the plot.

1920
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,160
Average, average visual novel fan.

1921
02:10:54,660 --> 02:10:56,340
I like it for the plot, I promise.

1922
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:58,820
This is a lot.

1923
02:10:58,960 --> 02:10:59,940
How far am I going?

1924
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:01,460
Wait, this looks like a button.

1925
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:03,040
We jump.

1926
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:05,980
Wait, I could have played crane game.

1927
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:09,200
Oh, no, I'm about to walk into my death.

1928
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:17,250
Oh, okay.

1929
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:18,290
This is where we stop.

1930
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:19,190
Okay, cool.

1931
02:11:22,030 --> 02:11:22,820
Press the button.

1932
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:28,670
Wait.

1933
02:11:29,370 --> 02:11:29,730
Oh.

1934
02:11:30,630 --> 02:11:31,170
Um.

1935
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:35,920
It went.

1936
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:40,400
It weighs, it's like a, as light as a feather.

1937
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:47,060
Well now, oh, I think I need it to jump over the spikes.

1938
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:57,260
The saw.

1939
02:11:59,200 --> 02:11:59,920
Oh, oops.

1940
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:04,040
Yes.

1941
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:06,720
Yes.

1942
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:09,220
Oops.

1943
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:12,140
We're okay.

1944
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:13,040
We're gamers.

1945
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:14,100
Oh, why did I run?

1946
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:24,240
Oh, that made me jump.

1947
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:28,460
Eat up!

1948
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,260
Thank you, thank you.

1949
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:34,360
Okay, one second, please.

1950
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:35,660
I take more bite.

1951
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:42,210
Yummy, yummy.

1952
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:44,070
Brainworm.

1953
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:51,960
Oh, who would have thunked that and killed me?

1954
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:00,180
Run!

1955
02:13:06,660 --> 02:13:06,740
Run!

1956
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:07,180
Okay.

1957
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:13,040
Let's go.

1958
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:19,210
Is this as far down as it gets?

1959
02:13:19,530 --> 02:13:19,750
Okay.

1960
02:13:20,610 --> 02:13:21,650
We can make it.

1961
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:22,030
Maybe.

1962
02:13:22,930 --> 02:13:23,450
Not.

1963
02:13:24,070 --> 02:13:24,870
Maybe not.

1964
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:27,090
Maybe not.

1965
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:31,050
Has to check every way to die in the game.

1966
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:43,470
Hey, go back up.

1967
02:13:43,670 --> 02:13:44,410
Go back up.

1968
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:45,790
Go back up!

1969
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:52,790
It does kind of twist, or not twist, uh, yeah, yeah.

1970
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:54,870
It kind of bobs up and down, so.

1971
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:56,170
Wait!

1972
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:57,370
Seriously?

1973
02:13:58,010 --> 02:13:59,550
He just, yeah!

1974
02:14:02,270 --> 02:14:03,390
Can it swing?

1975
02:14:03,550 --> 02:14:04,310
Let's try that.

1976
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:05,890
Good idea.

1977
02:14:09,130 --> 02:14:10,690
Doesn't seem like it.

1978
02:14:12,070 --> 02:14:15,790
From one person to another with a stutter, thank you for
changing the name.

1979
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:16,890
from Whispy.

1980
02:14:18,590 --> 02:14:19,570
You're welcome.

1981
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:30,480
The thing about it being a seesaw, though, is it doesn't
really like go...

1982
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,440
It's not that dramatic of a...

1983
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:43,920
Maybe we really gotta shake it up.

1984
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:51,080
Oh, that's good, that's good!

1985
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:51,740
Hoi!

1986
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,280
Give it time.

1987
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:02,920
Yeah, we are eyeball.

1988
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,060
Like eyeball.

1989
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,920
But Instead, boo.

1990
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:11,800
It did look higher, no?

1991
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:16,720
Like, around here, it stops moving.

1992
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,180
We gotta give it good momentum.

1993
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:27,040
Here we go.

1994
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:28,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1995
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:29,520
Okay, here we go.

1996
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:29,960
This is it.

1997
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:30,820
This is the run.

1998
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:35,640
Nice.

1999
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:36,980
Okay.

2000
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:39,160
Good job, team.

2001
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:42,140
Okay.

2002
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:43,560
And then we got to do the same here.

2003
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:48,960
I think?

2004
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,460
The ghost is playing Wimbo.

2005
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:54,920
Play inside?

2006
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:55,720
Is that a sequel?

2007
02:15:56,780 --> 02:15:57,060
Maybe.

2008
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:01,340
I can't tell if I'm really doing anything here.

2009
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:08,840
Okay.

2010
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:11,560
Closer.

2011
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:15,160
There we go.

2012
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:15,700
There we go.

2013
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:18,500
Push forward.

2014
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:20,640
Go, go, go, go.

2015
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:21,360
Go back.

2016
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:24,760
Push forward.

2017
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:29,360
I feel like I can make that, but I don't...

2018
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:29,880
Pull the hand.

2019
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:32,040
Oh my god, there's a handle!

2020
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:34,620
Sorry, I really...

2021
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:36,040
I didn't see it at all.

2022
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:36,840
I'm so sorry.

2023
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:43,150
Here I am, just...

2024
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:44,830
I'm...

2025
02:16:44,830 --> 02:16:46,570
Completely manual.

2026
02:16:47,910 --> 02:16:48,210
Yeah.

2027
02:16:50,970 --> 02:16:52,530
Alright, we're back here now.

2028
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:55,830
We got all this stuff going on.

2029
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:58,650
There was a, uh, this, yeah, this crate I noticed earlier.

2030
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:06,220
Whisp is our maiden name.

2031
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:09,340
Before the red dress?

2032
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:11,340
What is that supposed to be?

2033
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:13,660
Before the red dress.

2034
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:14,840
You guys are silly.

2035
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:16,320
Um,

2036
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,320
can I make that?

2037
02:17:40,490 --> 02:17:41,050
Um...

2038
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:50,810
that'll happen a puzzle will be so simple that you can
overcomplicate it well it's because the other one required

2039
02:17:50,810 --> 02:18:01,970

2044
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:56,890
Is there something that we need to get to?

2045
02:18:56,990 --> 02:19:02,210
Let's, we'll go over this way for the, for the, in the
meantime, we'll check this out over here.

2046
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:05,410
What do we have going on?

2047
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:07,510
A lever, a mysterious lever?

2048
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:09,530
Nazo no lever.

2049
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:17,860
What does this do?

2050
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:19,900
Okay.

2051
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:23,420
Nazo no car no joke.

2052
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:24,520
Why do you know that?

2053
02:19:25,820 --> 02:19:27,320
Why do you know that, series, huh?

2054
02:19:30,300 --> 02:19:30,660
Wait!

2055
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:34,360
Oh, uh, can't I just push it off?

2056
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:38,660
Don't fall, don't fall!

2057
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:39,680
Okay.

2058
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:42,140
Might not hurt the pin.

2059
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:42,840
Oh, that's true.

2060
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:44,300
Yeah, I could pin it and shot it.

2061
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:44,680
One second.

2062
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:46,140
Oh, gosh.

2063
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:57,140
Let's see.

2064
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:58,120
Okay, hold on.

2065
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:09,090
Thank you so much for the fire content.

2066
02:20:09,210 --> 02:20:09,690
Thank you!

2067
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:10,790
Thank you.

2068
02:20:10,790 --> 02:20:12,070
Thank you.

2069
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:17,070
I'm too, I'm not heavy enough.

2070
02:20:18,430 --> 02:20:20,570
I'm too small.

2071
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:27,800
I'm just a bag.

2072
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:29,420
I'm like a scaly man.

2073
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:40,950
But I can't reach this guy.

2074
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:41,690
I need him.

2075
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:48,380
The elevator?

2076
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:49,640
Wait, the elevator.

2077
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:54,000
something you will need to get the box out of that spot.

2078
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:57,240
This, wait, it'll have something?

2079
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:00,380
Oh no, not that one.

2080
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:00,680
Up?

2081
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:03,560
Hopefully just, oh okay, that's as far up as it goes.

2082
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:05,060
Does it go any further down?

2083
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:09,820
Crayon, thank you so much for not buying it, thank you!

2084
02:21:15,490 --> 02:21:17,570
Maybe I have to swing it here?

2085
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:18,190
No.

2086
02:21:24,110 --> 02:21:25,690
Let's grab my box.

2087
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:37,920
No, not up.

2088
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:39,520
No, just turn it off!

2089
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:41,060
No, just turn it off!

2090
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:41,900
No!

2091
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:45,460
Ah, man.

2092
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,180
Oh gosh, sorry, hold on, my nose.

2093
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:08,000
It's so itchy!

2094
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:14,360
I'm thinking, I'm thinking!

2095
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:17,720
Hold on!

2096
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:19,580
I can think about it, my nose!

2097
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:24,320
One second.

2098
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:26,060
Oh my god.

2099
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:28,220
It's so...

2100
02:22:28,220 --> 02:22:29,720
It's...

2101
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:30,320
Ugh.

2102
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:33,380
Ugh.

2103
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:42,020
Okay.

2104
02:22:44,440 --> 02:22:44,900
Okay.

2105
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:46,980
Okay.

2106
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:49,460
I'm okay!

2107
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:52,320
But still no sneeze.

2108
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:53,180
Sorry.

2109
02:22:58,360 --> 02:22:59,480
I don't know!

2110
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:00,440
Okay, I want a hint.

2111
02:23:01,420 --> 02:23:03,020
I want a hint.

2112
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:22,280
Grab something that is in the elevator.

2113
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:27,740
The only thing I can grab is a handle.

2114
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:31,460
Yeah, I know the platform has a handle.

2115
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:37,480
Doesn't swing very far.

2116
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:40,680
Unless I... Oh!

2117
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:42,160
I did it again.

2118
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:54,250
On top of the elevator.

2119
02:23:55,550 --> 02:23:56,390
On top.

2120
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:01,310
On top of the elevator.

2121
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:04,010
There we go.

2122
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:16,860
Okay, now I make it go back down.

2123
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:19,280
Upper.

2124
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:22,140
How do you see that?

2125
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:24,900
Up there?

2126
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:27,280
There's something there?

2127
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:28,140
I don't even see.

2128
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:29,180
Oh, look.

2129
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:30,480
Okay.

2130
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:31,720
Sorry.

2131
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:39,020
I need the, I think I need the box to get up there.

2132
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:42,000
What is, what, I don't even know what I'm getting up there
though.

2133
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:44,780
I think.

2134
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:49,970
Oh wait.

2135
02:24:51,250 --> 02:24:51,630
Ah.

2136
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:05,280
Get on top.

2137
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:06,840
And jump.

2138
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:13,550
Actually.

2139
02:25:14,510 --> 02:25:15,150
Oh wait.

2140
02:25:15,350 --> 02:25:18,330
I see the rope up there.

2141
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:20,970
Can I climb anything here?

2142
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:34,280
Hold?

2143
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:37,400
Oh wait, do I need to...

2144
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:37,580
Ah!

2145
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:38,700
Ah!

2146
02:25:39,060 --> 02:25:40,980
Okay, okay, wait, I have to be speed.

2147
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:43,000
I have to be super fast.

2148
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:44,200
Okay.

2149
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:45,940
And jump!

2150
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:54,970
Whoa!

2151
02:25:57,330 --> 02:25:58,950
Is that an Easter egg?

2152
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:00,270
Or...

2153
02:26:02,610 --> 02:26:03,430
Was that something?

2154
02:26:03,450 --> 02:26:05,130
like I need it or is that an easter egg?

2155
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:08,230
Am I gonna fall to my death?

2156
02:26:08,610 --> 02:26:08,890
Yes.

2157
02:26:09,230 --> 02:26:09,630
Take it.

2158
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:15,350
Wait, do I have to redo it?

2159
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:17,390
No!

2160
02:26:19,230 --> 02:26:20,850
It's just a secret.

2161
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:24,150
Well, I got it.

2162
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:37,100
Why did you guys tell me to go up there then?

2163
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:40,120
Ah!

2164
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:49,260
Is there another box up left?

2165
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:50,020
No?

2166
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:52,240
There isn't.

2167
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:54,300
No?

2168
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:55,420
Nothing else.

2169
02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:12,290
I feel like I need to swing it to where it goes pew and then
like slides upwards, you know.

2170
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:16,350
Why does he look so cute?

2171
02:27:16,450 --> 02:27:17,690
What did that mean, huh?

2172
02:27:27,410 --> 02:27:28,970
Very close.

2173
02:27:34,350 --> 02:27:35,810
Some way to make the chains longer.

2174
02:27:35,890 --> 02:27:38,230
Yeah, because it doesn't swing very much at all.

2175
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:41,890
But only way to make it chains longer is like this.

2176
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:44,350
But it doesn't, like, stop.

2177
02:27:44,510 --> 02:27:45,810
It only just, it goes.

2178
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:47,190
Like, I can't.

2179
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:51,470
No, no, no, come back.

2180
02:27:52,030 --> 02:27:53,030
I don't like this puzzle.

2181
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:56,750
One second.

2182
02:28:00,090 --> 02:28:00,470
Okay.

2183
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:05,230
I was making sure that I was like, Whenever I get pinged,
I'm like...

2184
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:06,190
Yes.

2185
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:07,690
Am I missing something?

2186
02:28:10,290 --> 02:28:13,230
Pull it onto the platform as it's going down.

2187
02:28:14,810 --> 02:28:16,030
You can do that!

2188
02:28:17,070 --> 02:28:18,310
Wait, you can do that!

2189
02:28:22,770 --> 02:28:25,270
Aww, what the hell?

2190
02:28:26,290 --> 02:28:26,890
What?

2191
02:28:27,750 --> 02:28:29,830
You can just do that!

2192
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:31,730
Oh, don't push it back.

2193
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:34,870
Oh my god!

2194
02:28:34,970 --> 02:28:36,330
I wouldn't have thought of that at all.

2195
02:28:36,670 --> 02:28:38,190
I don't even think you could do that.

2196
02:28:39,190 --> 02:28:40,330
What the heck?

2197
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:42,170
Oh my god.

2198
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:43,570
What?

2199
02:28:45,730 --> 02:28:48,370
I feel like that's crazy brained.

2200
02:28:49,230 --> 02:28:49,790
Wow!

2201
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:51,850
Oh my gosh.

2202
02:28:55,170 --> 02:28:56,850
Oh my gosh.

2203
02:28:57,390 --> 02:28:58,610
As chat said, handle.

2204
02:28:58,890 --> 02:28:59,890
I thought that's not...

2205
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:03,210
That doesn't be... I was trying to...

2206
02:29:03,230 --> 02:29:05,890
Use the handle to push it and swing it.

2207
02:29:11,310 --> 02:29:13,250
That was like super brained.

2208
02:29:14,250 --> 02:29:14,590
I don't know.

2209
02:29:14,970 --> 02:29:15,330
I wouldn't.

2210
02:29:15,490 --> 02:29:17,610
Even if you say handle, I'm not thinking of that.

2211
02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:17,970
What the?

2212
02:29:18,030 --> 02:29:20,730
Why did he grab it over his head like that?

2213
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:26,030
Actually, where do you go from here?

2214
02:29:26,070 --> 02:29:27,230
Maybe I swing to somewhere?

2215
02:29:29,650 --> 02:29:30,450
But to where?

2216
02:29:33,850 --> 02:29:34,290
Oh.

2217
02:29:35,850 --> 02:29:37,510
I wasn't supposed to go up, was I?

2218
02:29:39,610 --> 02:29:40,130
Eh.

2219
02:29:40,830 --> 02:29:41,130
Ugh.

2220
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,190
Ugh.

2221
02:29:43,790 --> 02:29:44,750
The lever?

2222
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:50,430
If I...

2223
02:29:50,430 --> 02:29:52,170
Do that...

2224
02:29:52,170 --> 02:29:52,530
Aha!

2225
02:29:52,870 --> 02:29:53,630
Oh gosh, oh gosh!

2226
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:55,990
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

2227
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:56,350
Jump, jump!

2228
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:58,710
Wait, my box is too far.

2229
02:29:59,230 --> 02:29:59,470
Okay.

2230
02:30:00,290 --> 02:30:01,690
Come back down, please.

2231
02:30:02,570 --> 02:30:02,870
Ugh.

2232
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:16,420
No!

2233
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:18,920
Oh, why am I a child?

2234
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:21,260
Oh, grow up already, kid.

2235
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:21,940
Grow up.

2236
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:24,240
It's a harsh, harsh world.

2237
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:25,120
Come on.

2238
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:36,590
Oh, my God.

2239
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:37,310
Oh, my God.

2240
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:37,850
I try.

2241
02:30:40,310 --> 02:30:40,710
Okay.

2242
02:30:41,190 --> 02:30:42,110
Just a little over.

2243
02:30:47,250 --> 02:30:49,470
He hasn't eaten in God knows how long.

2244
02:30:50,050 --> 02:30:51,430
I think it's his fault he's here.

2245
02:30:51,610 --> 02:30:51,730
Why?

2246
02:30:51,770 --> 02:30:52,210
What's he doing?

2247
02:30:52,290 --> 02:30:53,150
What's this kid doing here?

2248
02:30:53,690 --> 02:30:54,430
Oh, we got him.

2249
02:30:54,450 --> 02:30:55,470
We got him!

2250
02:30:56,050 --> 02:30:56,350
Yeah!

2251
02:31:00,610 --> 02:31:02,170
How far does this go anyway?

2252
02:31:03,370 --> 02:31:04,190
Where are we going?

2253
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:05,050
Oh, okay.

2254
02:31:05,230 --> 02:31:06,910
I do need to go down to that lever over there.

2255
02:31:07,190 --> 02:31:08,290
It's not letting me swing!

2256
02:31:10,170 --> 02:31:10,630
Okay, good.

2257
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:12,830
I was like, please don't break your legs.

2258
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:17,640
Uh-huh.

2259
02:31:18,220 --> 02:31:20,040
Oh, I don't...

2260
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:20,480
Oh.

2261
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:23,380
I think I see what's going on here.

2262
02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:30,390
Maybe?

2263
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:40,400
Oh, wait, I don't think I can...

2264
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:47,000
We're a little shorter than I thought we would be.

2265
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:54,640
This looks safe, yes.

2266
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:58,720
This is the world's safest factory ever.

2267
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,160
Ever, ever, ever.

2268
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:06,160
Oh, wait, I think I know what to do.

2269
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:06,460
Wait.

2270
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:09,600
Do I may have to make them stack?

2271
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:10,980
Oh, geez.

2272
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:11,800
Okay.

2273
02:32:13,540 --> 02:32:13,560
Um.

2274
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:16,680
So we need to release this one.

2275
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:21,200
The one on the left foot.

2276
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:23,280
Or, yeah, it would be easiest.

2277
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:24,300
The one on the left first.

2278
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:27,000
This timing seems kind of crazy.

2279
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:34,960
That should give me some time.

2280
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:35,720
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2281
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:36,560
Okay.

2282
02:32:51,770 --> 02:32:52,210
Okay.

2283
02:32:55,150 --> 02:32:58,490
Oh shoot, sometimes physics.

2284
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:01,590
Oh, don't get crushed.

2285
02:33:03,230 --> 02:33:04,850
Oh, I pressed it too late.

2286
02:33:10,730 --> 02:33:12,310
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

2287
02:33:17,770 --> 02:33:19,210
Oh, uh.

2288
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:26,830
Okay, I push the other button too soon.

2289
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:32,720
It's spinning backwards.

2290
02:33:33,140 --> 02:33:33,960
Don't look at it.

2291
02:33:34,580 --> 02:33:35,380
Don't think about it.

2292
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:36,900
Okay, three, two, one.

2293
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:38,100
Oh my gosh.

2294
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:43,470
Push, push, push, push, push.

2295
02:33:43,870 --> 02:33:46,430
I had the timing so good before.

2296
02:33:46,610 --> 02:33:47,170
What happened?

2297
02:33:48,550 --> 02:33:50,650
Somehow I had the timing so well.

2298
02:33:51,310 --> 02:33:57,110
Okay, what I also have to worry about is the saw eventually
starts coming, so...

2299
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:58,910
Okay, um...

2300
02:33:58,910 --> 02:34:00,330
Wait like five seconds.

2301
02:34:00,590 --> 02:34:01,230
Yeah, I know.

2302
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:08,830
One, two, three, four, five.

2303
02:34:11,410 --> 02:34:11,890
Okay.

2304
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:14,510
Oh, but I have to jump over it.

2305
02:34:15,730 --> 02:34:16,050
Oh!

2306
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:17,330
Wait!

2307
02:34:17,730 --> 02:34:17,950
Ah!

2308
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:18,270
Wait!

2309
02:34:18,490 --> 02:34:18,710
Ah!

2310
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:23,950
Oh, this game gets tricky!

2311
02:34:25,610 --> 02:34:27,790
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

2312
02:34:28,290 --> 02:34:29,530
Oh my gosh.

2313
02:34:32,990 --> 02:34:39,330
that's true i don't need well i think it'd be easier well
yes i have to stack them in that order because the saw oh

2314
02:34:39,330 --> 02:34:47,170
whoa uh three two one i think actually it'd be better for me
to pull it

2315
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:54,480
oh oh oh oh

2316
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:17,520
the toes literally got my toes this kid can't stand in two
inches of water but but his toes are gone and he's just like

2317
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:28,000
ouch all right yeah it's just the timing okay four three two
one brum

2318
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:37,010
oh the

2319
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:50,060
other one was not so difficult okay oh five four three two
one

2320
02:35:55,740 --> 02:36:00,160
oh Oh, please, please.

2321
02:36:10,910 --> 02:36:12,570
It was so perfect.

2322
02:36:12,750 --> 02:36:13,930
He just wouldn't climb up.

2323
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:28,660
I think I pressed it too early, but that's...

2324
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:30,540
Let's just try it.

2325
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:46,480
Donk.

2326
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:49,400
Donk.

2327
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:49,660
Donk.

2328
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:54,160
Five, four, three, two, one.

2329
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:01,720
Oh, my god.

2330
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:05,220
I was trying to get to the other side, but, you know.

2331
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:08,900
Four, three, two, one.

2332
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:10,720
Okay.

2333
02:37:17,220 --> 02:37:18,540
Oh my god, no!

2334
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,400
You stupid kid!

2335
02:37:25,710 --> 02:37:28,830
Four, three, two, one.

2336
02:37:44,470 --> 02:37:48,510
I think it's too difficult to push, like, the timing.

2337
02:37:48,770 --> 02:37:50,750
Oh, wait, why did I wait so long?

2338
02:37:50,870 --> 02:37:52,210
I was getting distracted.

2339
02:37:56,490 --> 02:38:00,430
It just... It just bounces right off.

2340
02:38:00,450 --> 02:38:03,690
It just bounces right off!

2341
02:38:04,570 --> 02:38:06,930
Three, two, one.

2342
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:15,360
Okay, now get on top.

2343
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:17,320
And good!

2344
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:20,250
Yeah!

2345
02:38:22,470 --> 02:38:23,210
Yeah!

2346
02:38:24,490 --> 02:38:24,930
Yeah!

2347
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:29,190
What was that?

2348
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:32,190
What was that?

2349
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:40,980
Any drowns?

2350
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,600
Wait, what am, what is happening?

2351
02:38:47,700 --> 02:38:50,560
I'm avoiding every...

2352
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:51,000
Oh!

2353
02:38:51,980 --> 02:38:54,140
Beneath the Arthropod.

2354
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:56,900
Oh.

2355
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:02,620
I was gaming.

2356
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:13,620
Don't look up.

2357
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:16,500
Gamers don't look up.

2358
02:39:18,100 --> 02:39:18,840
Cool secret.

2359
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:27,080
All right, what's going on in here?

2360
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:31,200
How much of the game do I have left?

2361
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:33,860
Are you friend?

2362
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:38,060
What do you do?

2363
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:40,160
You're just a bug.

2364
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:42,180
Can you carry me up there?

2365
02:39:53,320 --> 02:39:54,200
Fourth of the way.

2366
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:56,040
Might not be able to beat it today, then.

2367
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:57,160
That's okay though.

2368
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:02,080
Less than half.

2369
02:40:09,420 --> 02:40:10,020
It's okay.

2370
02:40:14,530 --> 02:40:14,930
Hmm.

2371
02:40:18,270 --> 02:40:22,150
Trying to like sneak up on it, but I don't think there's a
way.

2372
02:40:22,450 --> 02:40:22,670
Huh?

2373
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:29,060
Can I grab anything here?

2374
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:33,040
Would you like a little foot?

2375
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:35,580
Would you like my toes as well?

2376
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:52,060
Let's see, I can't tell of motion thing or oh oh he goes
back okay okay okay

2377
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:57,060
slow and steady

2378
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:38,110
jump on your back no why did you watch his little arms he
was just like please please my noggin is blockier there i'll

2379
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:40,710
move over just a tad again All right.

2380
02:41:42,510 --> 02:41:43,390
Go back down.

2381
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:43,910
Okay.

2382
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:59,280
I think I have to grab them rather than jump on them.

2383
02:42:05,780 --> 02:42:06,420
Start buzzing.

2384
02:42:09,940 --> 02:42:10,280
Start buzzing.

2385
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:13,180
Dang it!

2386
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:13,700
What the?

2387
02:42:15,710 --> 02:42:16,370
You.

2388
02:42:18,370 --> 02:42:19,050
Oh.

2389
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:30,920
Okay.

2390
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:36,480
We cannot crouch.

2391
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:43,500
I don't think it was the distance because our arms didn't go
out.

2392
02:42:51,310 --> 02:42:51,770
Yeah, we can't...

2393
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:54,890
I think I have to from here...

2394
02:42:54,890 --> 02:42:55,790
I have to attempt...

2395
02:42:55,790 --> 02:42:57,490
I can't even jump that far though.

2396
02:43:05,230 --> 02:43:06,350
If there's...

2397
02:43:06,350 --> 02:43:07,530
I don't think there's a walk.

2398
02:43:10,590 --> 02:43:12,930
It's just move or jump.

2399
02:43:14,850 --> 02:43:15,890
Very simple.

2400
02:43:25,830 --> 02:43:35,250
Okay, I'm gonna, once I get to the edge of the water, I'm
gonna run at him and grab him.

2401
02:43:51,290 --> 02:43:52,590
Three, two, one.

2402
02:43:58,370 --> 02:44:00,990
Gamerage, gamer rage, gamer rage, gamer rage.

2403
02:44:14,530 --> 02:44:15,090
Okay.

2404
02:44:18,310 --> 02:44:20,590
Yeah, if only there were a box, I know.

2405
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:23,470
This is the worst kind of thing.

2406
02:44:23,490 --> 02:44:32,770
stealth this is kind of gameplay that i like dislike it
forces you to be so slow you know and then when you have to

2407
02:44:32,770 --> 02:44:34,810
redo it it's very like

2408
02:44:38,250 --> 02:44:40,850
very you know it's just one of those annoying like

2409
02:44:45,370 --> 02:44:46,790
what the hell

2410
02:45:02,310 --> 02:45:05,090
i couldn't grab his little legs i tried

2411
02:45:17,390 --> 02:45:23,810
I think if I tap again I think if I tap again he's gonna
he's gonna run you know

2412
02:45:29,770 --> 02:45:39,850
yeah I knew it I knew it I knew it all it was was a tap you
guys all I did was a tap I did get closer than I ever had

2413
02:45:39,850 --> 02:45:44,050
before but I wasn't ready for him to jump so I should have
been

2414
02:45:51,020 --> 02:45:52,720
Oh, I hate this.

2415
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:55,220
This part sucks.

2416
02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:08,050
Because I don't know if I grab his legs or if I, like, you
know, use the action button.

2417
02:46:08,230 --> 02:46:16,430
Or if, like, because, you know, when he grabs ropes, it's
not really, like, uh, I don't have to grab it with the

2418
02:46:16,430 --> 02:46:16,790
button.

2419
02:46:17,550 --> 02:46:17,670
I think.

2420
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:31,380
No, I definitely need to grab his legs because the little
guy's arm reaches out for it.

2421
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:32,380
Oh, man.

2422
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:39,160
like it's it's just annoying though

2423
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:49,340
yeah it looks like I need to use the button because he
reaches out like it's a little character animation you know

2424
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:54,500
it just is annoying it's really annoying

2425
02:47:09,700 --> 02:47:17,800
nope nope if I just run it doesn't do anything it's not I
can hold the button it doesn't do anything

2426
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:37,540
Don't look at me I'm literally flicking The controller

2427
02:47:40,820 --> 02:48:05,060
I got his butt Yeah Yeah I'm not letting go I got here I'm
not letting go You can't make me Oh well I could do that And

2428
02:48:05,060 --> 02:48:12,980
that would That would cut Yeah Yeah That would cause me to
have to let go, yeah.

2429
02:48:18,100 --> 02:48:19,360
Oh, we made it.

2430
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:22,240
Oh.

2431
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:24,420
Whoa, freaky.

Thank you!

2434
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:30,540
Sure got a leg up on him.

2435
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:38,660
What's the point of having to open that, I wonder?

2436
02:48:41,460 --> 02:48:42,020
Okay.

2437
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:44,240
Where...

2438
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:45,940
Where does this go?

2439
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:48,920
Whoa, what is this?

2440
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:52,680
Oh, okay.

2441
02:48:53,860 --> 02:48:55,200
What does this do?

2442
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:57,660
Okay.

2443
02:48:58,740 --> 02:48:59,860
What does it do?

2444
02:49:01,180 --> 02:49:01,920
What are we...

2445
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:02,420
Oh, no.

2446
02:49:04,500 --> 02:49:05,040
Oh, no.

2447
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:06,280
Oh.

2448
02:49:06,940 --> 02:49:09,460
Oh, I guess we're making tires now.

2449
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:10,960
Oh,

2450
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:15,000
wow.

2451
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:15,780
That's pretty fast.

2452
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:16,500
Wait.

2453
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:19,780
Okay.

2454
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:21,060
Oh, geez.

2455
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:21,420
Okay.

02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:29,560
Okay.

2459
02:49:30,100 --> 02:49:30,280
Oh?

2460
02:49:30,940 --> 02:49:31,380
Okay.

2461
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:32,840
Okay.

2462
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:35,080
Wait.

2463
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:38,960
Uh, you can make it!

2464
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:39,500
Skinny legend!

2465
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:40,220
There you go!

2466
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:43,460
Me too is as cute as ever I see!

2467
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:45,080
Oh, my!

02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:51,440
Okay, wait, can I... Oh, wait, wait, boop, boop, boop!

2470
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:05,740
I think I did it.

2471
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:08,080
That did something.

2472
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:09,800
Arruga!

2473
02:50:12,620 --> 02:50:13,980
Nice and smooth.

2474
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:17,100
But what?

2475
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:18,380
Where did it land?

2476
02:50:22,810 --> 02:50:23,850
Over here?

2477
02:50:24,330 --> 02:50:24,650
Ah!

2478
02:50:25,630 --> 02:50:26,150
Ah!

2479
02:50:26,390 --> 02:50:26,650
Oh!

2480
02:50:28,670 --> 02:50:29,350
Okay.

2481
02:50:36,940 --> 02:50:37,680
Hmm.

2482
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:41,960
Big donut.

2483
02:50:45,980 --> 02:50:47,450
What else do we have?

2484
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:52,020
Whoa!

2485
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:54,920
Battle gear.

2486
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:57,020
Okay.

2487
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:59,820
Yeah, it does not give much time at all.

2488
02:51:00,680 --> 02:51:01,200
What the...

2489
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:05,800
I'm wondering if we can, like, stop the thing from...

2490
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:08,800
from closing?

2491
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:11,080
I don't even...

2492
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:12,860
But why?

2493
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:14,340
You know what I mean?

2494
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:17,240
Like, why am I... Oh, because I want that down!

2495
02:51:17,360 --> 02:51:18,480
Okay, this one doesn't move.

2496
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:18,840
Okay.

2497
02:51:19,320 --> 02:51:21,040
So maybe we want that down here.

2498
02:51:22,700 --> 02:51:24,420
Oh, probably so that I can get that lever.

2499
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:25,580
Okay, okay, okay.

2500
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:27,960
But why?

2501
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:31,080
Alright, so if I...

2502
02:51:32,500 --> 02:51:33,320
Let her rip?

2503
02:51:36,020 --> 02:51:36,840
Did I kill me?

2504
02:51:36,860 --> 02:51:37,060
No.

2505
02:51:37,080 --> 02:51:37,280
Okay.

2506
02:51:37,460 --> 02:51:37,740
Oh, gosh.

2507
02:51:37,900 --> 02:51:38,980
Wait, I don't have much time, then.

2508
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:39,480
Ah!

2509
02:51:42,100 --> 02:51:43,120
Run, run, run, run, run!

2510
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:43,540
Ah!

2511
02:51:49,430 --> 02:51:56,650
I was attempting to just stand on the ledge so that when it
opened up, I could grab it and pull it, but since it knocked

2512
02:51:56,650 --> 02:52:00,750
me off, um, that's why...

2513
02:52:00,750 --> 02:52:00,890
Okay.

2514
02:52:01,170 --> 02:52:04,310
But I think I have enough time because I... That's why...

2515
02:52:04,310 --> 02:52:07,710
Because when I tried this, yeah, it doesn't let you stand
there.

2516
02:52:08,530 --> 02:52:08,970
So...

2517
02:52:08,970 --> 02:52:09,490
Okay, okay.

2518
02:52:09,890 --> 02:52:10,330
Okay.

2519
02:52:11,070 --> 02:52:12,690
Push it to the left instead?

2520
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:15,790
I guess maybe I would have more...

2521
02:52:15,790 --> 02:52:17,650
Oh, if I have more...

2522
02:52:19,010 --> 02:52:22,510
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run!

2523
02:52:24,510 --> 02:52:25,390
Wait, but...

2524
02:52:25,390 --> 02:52:26,450
Well, I guess it'll still roll.

2525
02:52:26,890 --> 02:52:27,470
It'll still roll.

2526
02:52:27,990 --> 02:52:28,830
Okay, here we go.

2527
02:52:32,090 --> 02:52:32,350
Wait!

2528
02:52:36,130 --> 02:52:36,370
No!

2529
02:52:36,690 --> 02:52:37,670
Wait, did that kill me?

2530
02:52:39,930 --> 02:52:41,710
It tapped my head!

2531
02:52:42,830 --> 02:52:43,890
No, kidding.

2532
02:52:44,110 --> 02:52:44,530
Okay, wait.

2533
02:52:49,670 --> 02:52:52,090
It literally just bonked me.

2534
02:52:52,490 --> 02:52:53,050
Barely.

2535
02:52:53,270 --> 02:52:55,830
Yeah, I just grazed it for real.

2536
02:52:56,190 --> 02:52:56,970
It's crazy.

2537
02:52:59,370 --> 02:53:00,170
Okay, fine.

2538
02:53:00,290 --> 02:53:03,150
I'll pull it first, and then I'll get on top, and then I'll
push it over.

2539
02:53:05,150 --> 02:53:06,270
So needy.

2540
02:53:08,930 --> 02:53:11,550
Softest video game protagonist ever.

2541
02:53:13,590 --> 02:53:16,490
He's like, I'm Timmy, and I'm five years old.

2542
02:53:19,010 --> 02:53:21,190
My cranium is still growing.

2543
02:53:22,630 --> 02:53:25,470
It has not hardened to max capacity yet.

2544
02:53:30,230 --> 02:53:35,530
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

2545
02:53:38,910 --> 02:53:40,110
Oh, nice.

2546
02:53:43,210 --> 02:53:43,850
Tim, you have something.

2547
02:53:43,870 --> 02:53:45,050
0.3 HP.

2548
02:53:52,130 --> 02:53:52,990
Here we go.

2549
02:53:53,250 --> 02:53:54,150
Pulling another lever.

2550
02:53:55,170 --> 02:53:57,390
I love pulling those and not knowing what's going to happen.

2551
02:53:57,690 --> 02:53:57,870
Look at.

2552
02:53:57,910 --> 02:54:00,610
He's just looking around like, Did I do that?

2553
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:10,680
Very cool, Timmy.

2554
02:54:10,760 --> 02:54:11,160
Good job.

2555
02:54:15,090 --> 02:54:16,450
Pull the lever, cronk.

2556
02:54:18,310 --> 02:54:18,830
Yes.

2557
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:20,010
That one.

2558
02:54:20,550 --> 02:54:23,050
You pulled the correct lever, cronk.

2559
02:54:24,030 --> 02:54:24,850
You did it.

2560
02:54:26,730 --> 02:54:27,510

Okay Now, I'm not quite sure.

2573
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:25,180
I feel like if I put this here, well, I have enough time to
do everything.

2574
02:56:31,570 --> 02:56:32,250
Or do I...

2575
02:56:32,250 --> 02:56:33,130
Nope, not at all.

2576
02:56:34,350 --> 02:56:35,970
World's slowest climber.

2577
02:56:36,150 --> 02:56:38,130
Okay, so what we do is we push this on here.

2578
02:56:39,010 --> 02:56:39,950
And we jump here.

2579
02:56:41,850 --> 02:56:42,630
Got it.

2580
02:56:43,230 --> 02:56:45,410
She pulled on my lever to, like, wrong.

2581
02:56:47,410 --> 02:56:48,890
What happens when you do that?

2582
02:56:50,430 --> 02:56:50,830
Oh!

2583
02:56:51,630 --> 02:56:52,090
Oh!

2584
02:56:52,590 --> 02:56:54,550
I really wish I had known that.

2585
02:56:55,730 --> 02:56:57,470
Wait, are you gonna come back?

2586
02:57:11,570 --> 02:57:18,310
And death and die and suffer and never see the sunlight
again!

2587
02:57:28,300 --> 02:57:33,540
What if I just swing myself?

2588
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:36,660
What if I don't even press it?

2589
02:57:39,220 --> 02:57:39,820
Oh!

2590
02:57:48,090 --> 02:57:51,250
Oh wait, hold on, I think the girlies are asking for me.

2591
02:57:52,290 --> 02:57:54,130
Uh, uh, yes.

2592
02:57:55,430 --> 02:57:58,530
If you guys are good with it.

2593
02:57:59,850 --> 02:58:02,330
Um, and then also, uh, hold on.

2594
02:58:04,130 --> 02:58:05,790
I'm sending things to Vicky.

2595
02:58:06,850 --> 02:58:11,480
Um, where is my stuff anyway?

2596
02:58:11,840 --> 02:58:12,160
All here?

2597
02:58:13,140 --> 02:58:13,460
No.

2598
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:14,360
No.

2599
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:24,640
I have a folder for all of my stuff and now I can't find it.

2600
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:27,960
Where is it?

2601
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:29,140
Huh?

2602
02:58:32,580 --> 02:58:34,080
Where is it?

2603
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:35,840
Where are you?

2604
02:58:37,360 --> 02:58:38,540
What the heck?

2605
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:39,560
Maybe under here.

2606
02:58:40,420 --> 02:58:40,840
No?

2607
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:44,700
I have a folder for all of my stuff.

2608
02:58:45,300 --> 02:58:46,500
Now I can't find it.

2609
02:58:47,640 --> 02:58:50,910
It's kind of...

2610
02:58:50,910 --> 02:58:51,830
Great song, Winto.

2611
02:58:52,250 --> 02:58:53,350
Thank you!

2612
02:58:54,910 --> 02:58:55,330
Oh!

2613
02:58:55,910 --> 02:58:58,770
It's because...

2614
02:58:58,770 --> 02:59:02,290
The window was like...

2615
02:59:02,290 --> 02:59:07,990
The window was cut off because I moved it off the screen.

2616
02:59:13,330 --> 02:59:14,210
So...

2617
02:59:14,210 --> 02:59:16,270
Oh, here's my...

2618
02:59:25,790 --> 02:59:26,710
Okay, there we go.

2619
02:59:26,870 --> 02:59:27,710
Alright, I sent things.

2620
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:32,270
I'll just periodically check to see if they need me before
the collab today, you know?

2621
02:59:40,130 --> 02:59:41,010
Maybe I...

2622
02:59:41,010 --> 02:59:44,110
Grab it on the way back and I do a big swing.

2623
02:59:49,160 --> 02:59:50,940
Oh, that was so weak.

2624
02:59:52,780 --> 02:59:54,700
That was so weak!

2625
02:59:55,500 --> 02:59:56,760
You're this stupid kid!

2626
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:01,860
I wish I could...

2627
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:04,440
swing so hard that I can press this again.

2628
03:00:11,230 --> 03:00:13,090
He's just a little guy.

2629
03:00:17,350 --> 03:00:18,370
Five years old.

2630
03:00:18,510 --> 03:00:19,210
I don't even know that.

2631
03:00:19,290 --> 03:00:19,930
I made that up.

2632
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:24,800
Oh, wait.

2633
03:00:24,900 --> 03:00:25,260
Oh, shoot.

2634
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:28,980
Can I grab it?

2635
03:00:29,020 --> 03:00:29,680
Can I grab it?

2636
03:00:30,820 --> 03:00:31,240
Yes!

2637
03:00:35,180 --> 03:00:36,840
She's a genius!

2638
03:00:38,460 --> 03:00:38,800
Oh!

2639
03:00:39,480 --> 03:00:40,440
Oh, okay, we're fine.

2640
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:44,760
Oh,

2641
03:00:51,530 --> 03:00:52,930
I think everything is turning.

2642
03:00:53,770 --> 03:00:54,170
Wait a second.

2643
03:00:54,530 --> 03:00:55,550
That doesn't seem very good.

2644
03:00:57,470 --> 03:00:57,790
Wait.

2645
03:00:58,670 --> 03:00:58,910
Um.

2646
03:01:02,760 --> 03:01:06,240
Oh, the world is one big giant wheel.

2647
03:01:07,140 --> 03:01:10,340
It's one big battle gear.

2648
03:01:11,660 --> 03:01:12,620
Oh, is it still turning?

2649
03:01:12,860 --> 03:01:13,380
Oh, gosh.

2650
03:01:14,420 --> 03:01:15,140
Uh, Yolo.

2651
03:01:19,480 --> 03:01:20,580
Oh, man.

2652
03:01:20,960 --> 03:01:21,260
Okay.

2653
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:26,640
not quite sure what i do here but

2654
03:01:31,540 --> 03:01:37,240
because it turns that way so it's not like i can use the key
it can run on the gears or anything but it does seem like it

2655
03:01:37,240 --> 03:01:44,640
stops so i'll just wait till it's for it to stop drink some
of my tea in the meantime

2656
03:01:55,820 --> 03:01:56,700
oh no

2657
03:02:08,170 --> 03:02:11,750
i figured that this would have to open up, but...

2658
03:02:13,070 --> 03:02:14,750
I didn't think that...

2659
03:02:20,670 --> 03:02:24,190
I just... I didn't think that would...

2660
03:02:25,070 --> 03:02:26,370
I didn't know!

2661
03:02:27,170 --> 03:02:29,890
I saw it, like, at the very worst second.

2662
03:02:30,530 --> 03:02:31,710
Thank you so much for the super chat!

2663
03:02:31,830 --> 03:02:32,530
Thank you!

2664
03:02:37,710 --> 03:02:38,390
Whoa.

2665
03:02:39,750 --> 03:02:41,830
I think I go...

2666
03:02:41,830 --> 03:02:43,070
This way.

2667
03:02:43,930 --> 03:02:44,290
Perhaps.

2668
03:02:44,770 --> 03:02:45,490
What does this do?

2669
03:02:48,030 --> 03:02:49,310
What the heck?

2670
03:02:52,270 --> 03:02:53,330
Oh, there's stuff here.

2671
03:02:54,370 --> 03:02:55,610
There's a magnet.

2672
03:03:02,330 --> 03:03:02,930
Oh!

2673
03:03:03,630 --> 03:03:05,250
It's a big magnet!

2674
03:03:05,910 --> 03:03:06,310
Cool!

2675
03:03:08,550 --> 03:03:10,650
How am I supposed to get back up there again?

2676
03:03:16,590 --> 03:03:17,970
Maybe like this.

2677
03:03:20,230 --> 03:03:20,430
Splat.

2678
03:03:22,150 --> 03:03:23,590
That's so funny.

2679
03:03:24,410 --> 03:03:25,630
Oh, what wrong button?

2680
03:03:26,850 --> 03:03:27,630
Oh, jeez.

2681
03:03:28,090 --> 03:03:29,730
Taking a drink at the moment.

2682
03:03:31,730 --> 03:03:33,230
I didn't know.

2683
03:03:33,650 --> 03:03:34,590
I didn't know.

2684
03:03:34,910 --> 03:03:35,710
Go, go, go, go!

2685
03:03:37,010 --> 03:03:37,530
Yes.

2686
03:03:38,010 --> 03:03:38,610
Little baby.

2687
03:03:39,090 --> 03:03:40,290
Thank God you're a baby.

2688
03:03:42,050 --> 03:03:43,790
That seems bad.

2689
03:03:43,810 --> 03:03:44,530
Oh my god.

2690
03:03:47,900 --> 03:03:49,140
Wait, this seems worse.

2691
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:51,320
Um, wait.

2692
03:03:54,940 --> 03:03:57,820
Oh, I see the chain.

2693
03:03:58,480 --> 03:03:59,340
Uh-oh.

2694
03:03:59,580 --> 03:04:00,780
Uh, oh!

2695
03:04:01,720 --> 03:04:02,740
Oh, man.

2696
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:04,300
Wait, I'm not crushed yet.

2697
03:04:04,620 --> 03:04:04,760
Oh.

2698
03:04:07,580 --> 03:04:09,600
But I am sliced!

2699
03:04:25,500 --> 03:04:26,780
Oh, wait, don't do that.

2700
03:04:37,440 --> 03:04:39,800
Okay, I'm gonna climb to the very tippy top so it doesn't

2701
03:04:45,510 --> 03:04:50,110
I'm like all topsy-turvy, I have no idea what the depth of
anything is anymore.

2702
03:04:51,010 --> 03:04:52,530
It's not getting closer, is it?

2703
03:04:52,590 --> 03:04:53,050
No.

2704
03:04:54,310 --> 03:04:54,550
What

2705
03:05:14,160 --> 03:05:16,800
is, I thought everything had stopped moving.

2706
03:05:21,730 --> 03:05:22,550
Hello, Minto.

2707
03:05:22,990 --> 03:05:23,310
Hello!

2708
03:05:25,990 --> 03:05:27,570
I thought it had stopped.

2709
03:05:28,410 --> 03:05:31,330
The gears of time had ceased.

2710
03:05:34,030 --> 03:05:35,250
I see it now.

2711
03:05:35,250 --> 03:05:36,970
I see all the zips and the zaps.

2712
03:05:37,250 --> 03:05:37,630
I see it.

2713
03:05:37,710 --> 03:05:38,270
I see it.

2714
03:05:38,610 --> 03:05:40,190
Kua Vara, Kua Vara.

2715
03:05:42,210 --> 03:05:43,050
I see it.

2716
03:05:43,170 --> 03:05:43,850
I see it.

2717
03:05:45,830 --> 03:05:47,410
I know what I must do.

2718
03:05:50,330 --> 03:05:51,970
The gears of time never cease me.

2719
03:05:52,050 --> 03:05:53,050
Don't say that.

2720
03:05:54,050 --> 03:05:54,810
Okay, wait.

2721
03:05:56,750 --> 03:05:58,430
I was afraid of that.

2722
03:05:58,570 --> 03:05:59,590
Oh, my gosh.

2723
03:06:00,430 --> 03:06:03,330
As soon as I jumped, I was like, I think I'm going to get...

2724
03:06:04,010 --> 03:06:05,190
I'm going to get got.

2725
03:06:07,150 --> 03:06:08,110
Bad haircut.

2726
03:06:09,050 --> 03:06:11,990
They gave me the low taper fade.

2727
03:06:12,110 --> 03:06:12,770
I don't even know.

2728
03:06:12,990 --> 03:06:14,510
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2729
03:06:15,170 --> 03:06:15,610
Oh, God.

2730
03:06:17,010 --> 03:06:17,930
Give me time.

2731
03:06:23,180 --> 03:06:24,740
His hair got chopped and he died.

2732
03:06:24,840 --> 03:06:27,080
He died because he died of cringe.

2733
03:06:27,340 --> 03:06:30,320
He was like, oh, it's such an ugly haircut.

2734
03:06:31,300 --> 03:06:32,260
Dies of cringe.

2735
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:43,560
Okay.

2736
03:06:43,820 --> 03:06:44,320
Be ready.

2737
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:46,100
Be ready to jump.

2738
03:06:51,280 --> 03:06:52,000
Yes!

2739
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:53,820
Are we still turning?

2740
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:54,980
Yes.

2741
03:06:56,820 --> 03:06:57,240
Nice!

2742
03:06:58,700 --> 03:07:00,300
Oh, I think I just heard it locked.

2743
03:07:01,540 --> 03:07:02,720
Does that mean I can drop now?

2744
03:07:04,160 --> 03:07:06,880
I'll try to...

2745
03:07:10,750 --> 03:07:11,970
There we go.

2746
03:07:15,530 --> 03:07:16,070
Yeah!

2747
03:07:20,590 --> 03:07:21,310
Locked.

2748
03:07:25,170 --> 03:07:26,670
More spinning...

2749
03:07:26,670 --> 03:07:26,910
Oh.

2750
03:07:27,630 --> 03:07:28,070
Uh-oh.

2751
03:07:28,370 --> 03:07:28,590
Wait.

2752
03:07:30,190 --> 03:07:31,250
Wait, what?

2753
03:07:31,630 --> 03:07:31,770
Ah!

2754
03:07:32,790 --> 03:07:33,390
Ah!

2755
03:07:33,390 --> 03:07:33,470
Oh!

2756
03:07:34,490 --> 03:07:34,870
Wait!

2757
03:07:44,010 --> 03:07:45,710
I need to climb on top of you.

2758
03:07:46,890 --> 03:07:46,970
Oh!

2759
03:07:50,910 --> 03:07:53,390
It's even more funny because it's silent.

2760
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:10,960
Okay, I think I get on top of the box so that I can, um, so
that I can, uh, jump over the boulder.

2761
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:16,540
I believe I believe that's what I'm supposed to do

2762
03:08:19,770 --> 03:08:35,810
Jump I don't know it seems kind of It seems kind of short
the box We got indeed There needs to be some sort of sound

2763
03:08:35,810 --> 03:08:42,290
effect I fear I feel there needs to be some sort of sound
effect

2764
03:08:51,220 --> 03:08:51,780
Instead...

2765
03:08:51,780 --> 03:08:51,960
Oh.

2766
03:09:02,080 --> 03:09:04,180
Oh, oops, there we go.

2767
03:09:06,980 --> 03:09:10,100
First you don't get got by the box.

2768
03:09:12,900 --> 03:09:16,120
And then push, push, push, push, push, push, push.

2769
03:09:16,120 --> 03:09:17,720
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push.

2770
03:09:17,980 --> 03:09:18,900
Push, push, push, push, push.

2771
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:22,540
Push, push, push.

2772
03:09:22,540 --> 03:09:24,540
And then do I climb it?

2773
03:09:24,860 --> 03:09:26,080
And then do I jump it?

2774
03:09:26,300 --> 03:09:26,640
Yeah.

2775
03:09:26,820 --> 03:09:27,040
Oh!

2776
03:09:30,180 --> 03:09:32,600
The light is following.

2777
03:09:32,780 --> 03:09:34,160
Oh, the light is.

2778
03:09:35,560 --> 03:09:36,400
Butterfly.

2779
03:09:40,860 --> 03:09:41,240
Yes.

2780
03:09:41,680 --> 03:09:42,400
Do I follow you?

2781
03:09:44,020 --> 03:09:45,100
Hey, listen.

2782
03:09:46,040 --> 03:09:46,460
Grass!

2783
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:48,620
Wait, a person.

2784
03:09:50,740 --> 03:09:50,820
Oh.

2785
03:09:51,480 --> 03:09:52,040
No!

2786
03:09:52,760 --> 03:09:53,120
No!

2787
03:09:53,720 --> 03:09:55,100
Wait, but there was a person!

2788
03:09:57,360 --> 03:09:58,200
No!

2789
03:09:59,540 --> 03:10:00,240
No!

2790
03:10:01,340 --> 03:10:02,660
Was there light in here?

2791
03:10:04,460 --> 03:10:06,420
Please, there was light somewhere, right?

2792
03:10:07,980 --> 03:10:08,900
Yes, this one.

2793
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:15,420
I'm going to go back and she'll be gone.

2794
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:19,940
Oh, wait, what was that sound?

2795
03:10:20,400 --> 03:10:21,280
She got crushed.

2796
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:23,360
She's...

2797
03:10:23,360 --> 03:10:24,140
Wait, what is this?

2798
03:10:27,160 --> 03:10:28,040
Oh, um...

03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:29,420
Wait, where did the grass go?

2800
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:30,460
Uh-oh.

2801
03:10:31,780 --> 03:10:32,220

2802
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:33,740
Oh, no.

2803
03:10:44,670 --> 03:10:45,170
Buttgrass.

2804
03:10:45,370 --> 03:10:45,590
No!

2805
03:10:47,550 --> 03:10:49,150
I think I can make it.

2806
03:10:49,970 --> 03:10:50,530
Run, run, run!

2807
03:10:50,910 --> 03:10:51,050
Jump!

2808
03:10:51,470 --> 03:10:51,850
Nice.

2809
03:10:56,630 --> 03:10:57,290
Oh, wait.

2810
03:10:57,370 --> 03:10:58,430
This one's tricky, maybe.

2811
03:11:00,310 --> 03:11:01,370
Run, run, run, run, run.

2812
03:11:01,370 --> 03:11:01,450
Oh!

2813
03:11:01,850 --> 03:11:03,210
Definitely not made that.

2814
03:11:04,190 --> 03:11:04,970
Oh, come on.

2815
03:11:04,990 --> 03:11:06,150
I made this one.

2816
03:11:07,310 --> 03:11:08,150
Come on.

2817
03:11:08,510 --> 03:11:09,290
Come on.

2818
03:11:15,700 --> 03:11:29,500
I thought maybe I would go back and get the like I can't
turn around though for the for the ladder squish squish

2819
03:11:29,500 --> 03:11:32,980
squash oh my

2820
03:11:38,380 --> 03:11:44,820
god oh but your toe your fingies don't get don't get got huh
is that the case

2821
03:11:49,770 --> 03:11:55,430
I played this years ago and enjoyed it very atmospheric it
is very atmospheric yes

2822
03:11:59,410 --> 03:12:03,970
and jump jump oh my gosh I still think it was too slow

2823
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:21,440
there we go run run run this one's tricky what happens if
you let the conveyor belt carry you back Probably death.

2824
03:12:23,840 --> 03:12:24,360
Probably death.

2825
03:12:33,560 --> 03:12:34,020
I don't see.

2826
03:12:34,220 --> 03:12:37,340
I was like looking maybe if there's like a little pixel
perfect hole.

2827
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:39,760
Oh, I think I get it.

2828
03:12:41,320 --> 03:12:41,580
Wait.

2829
03:12:41,820 --> 03:12:42,080
Oh, no.

2830
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:49,160
What I was going to try and do was if I tried to force
myself to walk left, you walk a little bit slow.

2831
03:12:49,280 --> 03:12:51,740
Like, see like that, you can walk fast.

2832
03:12:52,700 --> 03:12:57,080
So I was going to try and force myself to stay left.

2833
03:12:57,100 --> 03:12:58,980
I don't know if I'm going to make this.

2834
03:12:59,100 --> 03:12:59,400
Oh, I did.

2835
03:13:00,660 --> 03:13:01,060
But.

2836
03:13:03,220 --> 03:13:06,000
So that I could then be on the platform.

2837
03:13:07,360 --> 03:13:08,500
Unless that's what you do.

2838
03:13:08,800 --> 03:13:10,440
And you just have to be really good at it.

2839
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:13,480
Yeah, like on the edge.

2840
03:13:13,740 --> 03:13:14,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2841
03:13:17,220 --> 03:13:19,040
You see how it sticks out right there?

2842
03:13:20,460 --> 03:13:21,560
Can you hang on?

2843
03:13:23,700 --> 03:13:24,100
Oh!

2844
03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:25,920
You can!

2845
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:27,080
Wait, get up.

2846
03:13:27,100 --> 03:13:27,440
Get up!

2847
03:13:27,740 --> 03:13:28,200
Get up, kid!

2848
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:28,500
Get up!

2849
03:13:32,630 --> 03:13:33,370
Oh my gosh.

2850
03:13:35,170 --> 03:13:35,630
Please!

2851
03:13:36,270 --> 03:13:37,790
Eat my breadworm!

2852
03:13:38,610 --> 03:13:39,290
Eat it!

2853
03:13:39,490 --> 03:13:40,550
Yes, thank you.

2854
03:13:41,370 --> 03:13:44,610
Oh, but I think I have to go back now, right?

2855
03:13:45,790 --> 03:13:46,510
I think.

2856
03:13:48,950 --> 03:13:49,870
Oh wait!

2857
03:13:50,510 --> 03:13:50,510
Ah!

2858
03:13:55,050 --> 03:13:55,830
Oh, good.

2859
03:13:55,990 --> 03:13:57,110
Oh, good checkpoint.

2860
03:13:57,270 --> 03:13:57,690
Good checkpoint.

2861
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:04,060
Please, please come back down.

2862
03:14:07,370 --> 03:14:08,910
Oh, maybe I can.

2863
03:14:13,050 --> 03:14:14,970
I don't know if I can reach it.

2864
03:14:16,410 --> 03:14:16,650
Oops.

2865
03:14:20,230 --> 03:14:23,510
Can I push these?

2866
03:14:25,170 --> 03:14:26,170
Yes, I can.

2867
03:14:30,460 --> 03:14:31,860
Oh, not enough.

2868
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:32,400
Not enough.

2869
03:14:39,980 --> 03:14:40,620
Wait.

2870
03:14:41,100 --> 03:14:41,220
Wait.

2871
03:14:41,220 --> 03:14:41,400
Oh, wait.

2872
03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:41,920
Oh, wait.

2873
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:47,460
I forgot to not...

2874
03:14:48,260 --> 03:14:48,820
To...

2875
03:14:48,820 --> 03:14:49,340
To...

2876
03:14:49,340 --> 03:14:50,300
To...

2877
03:14:50,300 --> 03:14:51,220
Just hold on.

2878
03:14:51,320 --> 03:14:51,740
I forgot.

2879
03:14:52,820 --> 03:14:53,400
I forgot.

2880
03:14:54,180 --> 03:14:54,720
Okay, okay, okay.

2881
03:14:54,800 --> 03:14:56,540
Here we go.

2882
03:14:59,240 --> 03:14:59,340
Oh.

2883
03:14:59,780 --> 03:15:00,200
Well.

2884
03:15:02,220 --> 03:15:04,900
The world's softest noggin.

2885
03:15:06,260 --> 03:15:06,600
Truly.

2886
03:15:10,140 --> 03:15:13,460
The world's softest noggin.

2887
03:15:20,540 --> 03:15:27,480
Oh, he's got group strength 100, but when it comes to his
little brain.

2888
03:15:28,520 --> 03:15:28,760
Whoop!

2889
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:30,660
First try.

2890
03:15:31,720 --> 03:15:33,520
You forgoor to hold!

2891
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:36,840
First try, first try.

2892
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:39,920
What is this?

2893
03:15:44,540 --> 03:15:45,880
Ride the crates.

2894
03:15:47,260 --> 03:15:48,820
Wait, was this all optional?

2895
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:49,360
No.

2896
03:15:53,740 --> 03:15:56,700
Oh, you're telling me this was optional?

2897
03:15:57,060 --> 03:15:59,100
Wait, oh, I didn't mean to do that.

2898
03:16:03,780 --> 03:16:04,220
Eggie?

2899
03:16:13,370 --> 03:16:14,890
Do I have to make it?

2900
03:16:15,010 --> 03:16:15,250
Wait.

2901
03:16:18,190 --> 03:16:20,610
You have to, like, this turns it the other way, no?

2902
03:16:28,600 --> 03:16:29,300
Oh, yes.

2903
03:16:29,640 --> 03:16:30,460
Oh, perfect.

2904
03:16:30,820 --> 03:16:31,400
Oh, my gosh.

2905
03:16:31,880 --> 03:16:32,660
Yes, yes, yes.

2906
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:36,800
She's too good, Your Honor.

2907
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:38,200
I know.

2908
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:41,640
She was the best.

2909
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:42,380
Hoi!

2910
03:16:43,420 --> 03:16:44,380
So close.

2911
03:16:44,520 --> 03:16:47,240
She was the best.

2912
03:16:47,500 --> 03:16:47,580
Hoi!

2913
03:16:49,580 --> 03:16:50,260
I

2914
03:16:54,800 --> 03:16:56,900
don't know if I want to turn that on.

2915
03:17:03,700 --> 03:17:05,760
Seems a little dangerous.

2916
03:17:06,460 --> 03:17:07,280
Is there a save?

2917
03:17:08,060 --> 03:17:09,180
I guess load chapter.

2918
03:17:09,640 --> 03:17:09,980
Hmm.

2919
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:14,080
This one is frustrating.

2920
03:17:17,380 --> 03:17:18,520
The others weren't.

2921
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:19,580
The others weren't frustrating.

2922
03:17:25,980 --> 03:17:27,630
I don't quite understand it.

2923
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:33,900
Why don't I just go when there's no electricity?

2924
03:17:36,200 --> 03:17:37,920
It does save often, yeah.

2925
03:17:38,120 --> 03:17:39,080
Wait, can I go forward?

2926
03:17:48,910 --> 03:17:50,790
I killed myself.

2927
03:17:57,430 --> 03:18:07,870
Guys, if I can't beat it today, I wonder if I should beat
it, if I should play while I'm in Japan.

2928
03:18:17,120 --> 03:18:23,420
Oh, I'm guessing that there's like, that like this door is
open or something.

2929
03:18:25,520 --> 03:18:26,180
Or what?

2930
03:18:28,080 --> 03:18:30,880
Does this open or something and we have to go through?

2931
03:18:31,080 --> 03:18:32,820
But there's a lever up there, too.

2932
03:18:34,060 --> 03:18:34,760
Oh, no, no.

2933
03:18:41,820 --> 03:18:43,520
An hour and a half left.

2934
03:18:46,660 --> 03:18:47,300
I would...

2935
03:18:47,300 --> 03:18:56,360
That would put me right exactly up to the collab, and I kind
of want to make sure I eat properly before then.

2936
03:18:56,660 --> 03:18:57,420
80% done.

2937
03:18:57,500 --> 03:19:00,540
I think that's fine then, because then I could finish it
while I'm there.

2938
03:19:01,520 --> 03:19:02,940
It would be a very easy...

2939
03:19:03,840 --> 03:19:04,280
Well...

2940
03:19:05,160 --> 03:19:06,520
Oh, wait, can I...

2941
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:19,360
I could desktop screen share or desktop capture I could
desktop capture while I'm there it's just my laptop so

2942
03:19:19,360 --> 03:19:31,560
there's really nothing on there yeah so we'll part two on
this game because that's okay um and that's also makes it

2943
03:19:31,560 --> 03:19:39,520
easy easy for me too because uh you know streams in Japan
what a little bit shorter just because you know i'll be out

2944
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:50,040
doing things and being busy and stuff with with my plans
that i have going on so yeah yeah yeah i just really i

2945
03:19:50,040 --> 03:19:55,960
really wanted to get in as many streams as possible because
i know i was gone last week with stuff and then i'll be gone

2946
03:19:55,960 --> 03:20:08,000
uh i be i will be back on december oh my gosh just saying
december december 8th i will be back so it's quite a bit of

2947
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:16,960
time um streams will be oh my god step stop making noise
stop it

2948
03:20:20,340 --> 03:20:32,780
streams will be a little uh kind of just whenever i can um
it's a pretty i have a pretty busy schedule this time so and

2949
03:20:32,780 --> 03:20:39,380
they probably will be like morning for the US.

2950
03:20:40,020 --> 03:20:41,960
So, yeah.

2951
03:20:42,840 --> 03:20:44,240
How much of November left anyway.

2952
03:20:44,360 --> 03:20:52,100
I can't believe that next week is the last week, the last
full week of November.

2953
03:20:52,760 --> 03:20:58,600
So it is like two weeks, but I'm going to try and get in at
least a couple live streams while I'm over there.

2954
03:20:59,980 --> 03:21:00,980
It's already Thanksgiving.

2955
03:21:01,220 --> 03:21:02,580
I know, I know.

2956
03:21:03,500 --> 03:21:04,000
I know.

2957
03:21:05,980 --> 03:21:09,460
so soon 2026 don't say that it's scary

2958
03:21:15,770 --> 03:21:21,330
at least thanksgiving for the u.s i think what canada had
their thanksgiving when do you guys have your thanksgiving

2959
03:21:21,330 --> 03:21:32,170
if anybody canadian is here or knows you're streaming mgs
delta with doki she said that but i told her i was just like

2960
03:21:32,170 --> 03:21:44,810
i'll try and make it i don't know my schedule yet i will try
to make it to doki's metal gear stream but i literally was

2961
03:21:44,810 --> 03:21:51,230
just like i don't know because i will be over there and also
i don't know what time you're gonna be streaming it at if

2962
03:21:51,230 --> 03:22:00,550
it's like 2 a.m my time and then the next day i have
something to do like but but she did ask me about it and i

2963
03:22:00,550 --> 03:22:08,730
did say that i would do my best to to make it, so I can at
least watch her play and get upset at how little she knows

2964
03:22:08,730 --> 03:22:16,810
about Metal Gear and also probably completely nerd out and
be like, and then, blah, blah, blah, oh, Doki, call the

2965
03:22:16,810 --> 03:22:19,450
Kodak right now, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

2966
03:22:20,230 --> 03:22:22,650
Just got back from my friend's wedding to catch the end
here.

2967
03:22:23,130 --> 03:22:24,930
Oh, sounds fine.

2968
03:22:25,870 --> 03:22:27,170
I'm putting my arms up.

2969
03:22:27,310 --> 03:22:27,850
It's uncomfy.

2970
03:22:29,970 --> 03:22:31,450
Putting them down is uncomfortable.

2971
03:22:33,450 --> 03:22:42,930
I don't know I hope that I'm you know there were enough
streams this week I and hopefully hopefully I will see you

Thank you for all the streams this week.

2986
03:24:26,500 --> 03:24:28,180
And the debuts and everything.

2987
03:24:28,520 --> 03:24:29,560
I'm very tired.

2988
03:24:29,800 --> 03:24:30,960
I need a vacation.

2989
03:24:31,780 --> 03:24:35,400
But, alas, all my turn into work.

2990
03:24:35,560 --> 03:24:42,060
I had another vacation plan for March, and then that also is
getting turned into work.

2991
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:45,640
I was like, well, November didn't work out.

2992
03:24:46,880 --> 03:24:48,900
I had plans in March.

2993
03:24:50,360 --> 03:24:51,720
And then it got turned into work.

2994
03:24:52,260 --> 03:24:53,600
Like, mega work.

2995
03:24:54,900 --> 03:24:57,060
Looking forward to the dance and the collab and song
premiere.

2996
03:24:57,200 --> 03:24:57,940
Thank you.

2997
03:24:58,180 --> 03:24:58,820
Thank you, thank you.

2998
03:25:01,460 --> 03:25:03,060
How does that happen?

2999
03:25:03,240 --> 03:25:09,980
Basically, There are things that, how do I say, without
giving anything away.

3000
03:25:10,900 --> 03:25:13,320
Or rather, without explaining too much.

3001
03:25:14,240 --> 03:25:17,660
There are certain things that are easier to do in Japan.

3002
03:25:18,320 --> 03:25:21,580
And so I was like, I was, ouch.

3003
03:25:21,720 --> 03:25:25,360
I was already going to try and be in Japan for an idle
event.

3004
03:25:29,240 --> 03:25:33,440
That I was waiting to hear when it will happen.

3005
03:25:33,900 --> 03:25:36,040
And then...

3006
03:25:36,140 --> 03:25:39,840
They were like, oh, by the way, can we schedule this thing
for you?

3007
03:25:42,220 --> 03:25:43,260
Literally during...

3008
03:25:43,260 --> 03:25:43,940
Oh, yay!

3009
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:45,160
Thank you.

3010
03:25:47,620 --> 03:25:52,780
In the middle of March, and I was like, oh, oh, I see.

3011
03:25:56,200 --> 03:25:57,240
Oh, so...

3012
03:25:59,440 --> 03:25:59,960
Yeah.

3013
03:26:01,200 --> 03:26:03,860
So, it just kind of happens.

3014
03:26:04,160 --> 03:26:06,120
And then also with this trip, I was only...

3015
03:26:06,140 --> 03:26:12,540
supposed to be in japan for like a couple of days and then
they were and then i got asked if i wanted to be a part of

3016
03:26:12,540 --> 03:26:19,080
something and i was like oh my gosh yes and then i got asked
another thing if i had to be a part of and i was like ah

3017
03:26:19,080 --> 03:26:23,320
yeah well i'm already over there so i know

3018
03:26:29,880 --> 03:26:33,720
so yeah yeah

3019
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:56,220
suffering from success a little bit a little bit but it'll
be cool stuff you know for the future and like i i just love

3020
03:26:56,220 --> 03:27:04,860
streaming so much that i feel really bad when i am not
streaming um so that's why i do bring all my stuff to to you

3021
03:27:04,860 --> 03:27:15,660
know stream as much as i can when i can while i'm there so
yeah there will be some streams it will just be kind of

3022
03:27:15,660 --> 03:27:17,780
sporadic i apologize in advance.

3023
03:27:19,120 --> 03:27:22,740
But we'll do some fun stuff where I'll be like, I'm gonna...

3024
03:27:23,460 --> 03:27:26,260
Like, so... Like, these types of...

3025
03:27:26,260 --> 03:27:33,000
Like, like, streams are sometimes things that I don't do at
home.

3026
03:27:33,320 --> 03:27:33,680
I don't know.

3027
03:27:33,940 --> 03:27:41,000
Like, I'll just be like, oh, well, it's easier set up to do
ASMR or something while I'm over there rather than here.

3028
03:27:41,160 --> 03:27:42,580
I don't know why I think that.

3029
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:43,140
I don't know.

3030
03:27:43,180 --> 03:27:45,420
I get stressed out doing ASMR.

3031
03:27:45,620 --> 03:27:46,720
I'm like, I'll just do it in a hotel room.

3032
03:27:46,740 --> 03:27:47,120
room.

3033
03:27:48,360 --> 03:27:49,960
Don't break yourself, K.

3034
03:27:50,420 --> 03:27:50,420
Ah!

3035
03:27:51,720 --> 03:27:55,000

Make sure the Wi-Fi... The Wi-Fi... No, we'll be okay.

3038
03:28:06,020 --> 03:28:06,880
We'll be okay.

3039

3052
03:29:49,340 --> 03:29:50,280
What do you mean, low-key?

3053
03:29:50,620 --> 03:29:52,000
Oh, like, just like a chill stream?

3054
03:29:52,120 --> 03:29:55,900
Yeah, I think it'll probably be a bit of those while I'm in
Japan.

3055
03:29:56,080 --> 03:29:57,180
But that's, I hope you guys don't mind.

3056
03:29:58,600 --> 03:30:03,140
It'll be just kind of like hanging out and stuff, which I
think is fun too.

3057
03:30:03,440 --> 03:30:07,860
There might be a little shorter as well, which is why I'm
like, oh, if I can finish this game while I'm over there,

3058
03:30:08,360 --> 03:30:09,200
that would be great.

3059
03:30:09,920 --> 03:30:12,720
Because, you know, then it'll be a bit of a shorter stream,
but that's okay too.

3060
03:30:13,780 --> 03:30:15,660
Short and chatting and stuff like that.

3061
03:30:16,920 --> 03:30:17,500
Yeah.

3062
03:30:18,420 --> 03:30:19,180
We don't mind at all.

3063
03:30:19,640 --> 03:30:20,380
Thank you!

3064
03:30:20,460 --> 03:30:22,780
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

3065
03:30:23,180 --> 03:30:24,740
I appreciate it.

3066
03:30:25,580 --> 03:30:26,300
Okie dokie!

3067
03:30:26,680 --> 03:30:29,280
We will raid, we will raid, we will raid.

3068
03:30:29,680 --> 03:30:34,080
And I will see you guys when I see you later.

3069
03:30:34,640 --> 03:30:35,100
Bye bye!

3070
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:37,780
I'll see you at the collab, hopefully.

3071
03:30:38,460 --> 03:30:40,040
Otsumi and to eat atashai!

3072
03:30:40,480 --> 03:30:41,040
Bye bye!

3073
03:30:41,340 --> 03:30:41,920
Bye bye!
