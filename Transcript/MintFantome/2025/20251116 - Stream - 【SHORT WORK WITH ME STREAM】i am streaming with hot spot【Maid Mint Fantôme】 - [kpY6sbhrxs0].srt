1

Wait, hold on, I'm moving.

5
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:19,410
I'm grabbing my mic and said, Oh, go ahead, Jinjama,
itchama, hello.

6
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,990
Look, though.

7
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:33,970
P&D but I have video in the background so that you will
still watch so that you will still you'll still be paying

8
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:49,910
attention yeah hello everybody um I'm in a hotel room so
there were many things that went wrong with this stream the

9
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:58,650
first being that I'm a hotel room and the second being that
oh my gosh the what's it called the the noise gate on this

10
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:06,970
thing is crazy how does it sound oh okay never mind the go
xlr program does not work so i actually can't update

11
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,630
anything so we're just gonna i sound loud we're just gonna
we're just gonna we're just gonna

12
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:33,950
we're just gonna do it I sound okay I sound fine okay um
what was I saying oh so I'm in the hotel room and um well I

13
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:42,990
was like I'm gonna test okay hold on let me explain hotel
struggles first um I was like okay I'm going to sign in to

14
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:54,310
get free wi-fi and then they were like oh sorry you can't
log in right now we're working on it i said okay cool then

15
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:07,930
i'll hot spot so i'm hot spotting and it might be bad
hopefully not bad though and then and then um and then

16
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:21,930
there's one plug by the desk and i need a plug for my laptop
and also for this USB hub that I bring with me so I need two

17
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:45,830
plugs and because I cannot plug in both I cannot also plug
in my camera for me to move and so I need two plugs And so,

18
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,590
because of that, hotel Wi-Fi is always a gamba.

19
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,130
Well, it shouldn't be.

20
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,810
Can't you plug your camera directly into your computer?

21
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,890
Great question.

22
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:08,350
I cannot do that because I only have two USB slots, and
that's why I need the USB hub, because I need to plug in my

23
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,210
GoAXLR, and I need to plug in my mouse, and I need to plug
in...

24
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,570
My phone.

25
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,810
USP.

26
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,330
Usp.

27
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,030
Usp.

28
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,210
Yeah, I'm Metal Gear thinking about guns.

29
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,470
So...

30
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,190
So...

31
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,430
You put Family Guy clips in the corner.

32
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,370
No!

33
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,450
They're gonna take me out.

34
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,630
This is Family Guy.

35
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,630
Hold on.

36
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,530
How's the song go?

37
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:58,310
uh um it seems today that all you see is violence and movies
and sex on tv wait hold on commercial 11 21 start but where

38
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:10,050
are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely
lucky there's a family guy lucky there's a man who can do

39
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,850
all the things that make us cry.

40
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,770
She's a family guy.

41
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,560
Ouch.

42
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm like laying on the couch.

43
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,400
Not laying on the couch.

44
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,980
I'm sitting, but I threw my head back because I was laughing
and I hit my head.

45
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,100
have a feeling that it's gonna be a wonderful day that's the
superior show i like american dad way more than i like

46
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:09,170
family guy i think that's the superior show the sun in the
sky has a smile on face and a salute to the american verse

47
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:19,110
oh boy on tuesday good morning rosie

48
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:31,330
boys oh yeah shot b12 yeah i've been watching american down
in so long though

49
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:47,950
but um uh yeah so then that's why I'm a PNG I apologize but
I have some work that I need to get done that's why I

50
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:55,290
brought my laptop in the first place and my whole setup but
as you can see it's a little scuffed and I was like oh so

51
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:08,970
also I had bought a smaller version of my interface that I
use at the maid cafe be my travel interface this is

52
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:19,330
previously and then i used it at an event and it completely
like shot itself it was it was uh like i guess it's made

53
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:28,990
more for i'm i don't i thought i was using it correctly but
i guess it's made more for um like musical like playing

54
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:37,690
playing like if you're recording guitar and stuff and uh i
figured i was like you know if i ever do a collab like on

55
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:44,070
its own it was totally fine if i was doing a collab or
something it would like double the audio and things like

56
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:52,910
that so i was like okay well i'll get i'll get rid of it and
then um i bought the the mini go xlr which i have not had a

57
00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:08,230
go xlr in an extremely long time yeah it was really awful
used it at MGS con and um it was you know I thought I had

58
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:18,910
the correct settings but there literally was no other
settings that I could try so I uh I I was like oh I'm so and

59
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,090
I felt so terrible because you know I was like I thought it
was the same as my interface at home but it just didn't have

60
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:36,330
enough channels of how I do my setup um didn't go or die i
yes but also they were like bought out question mark or

61
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:45,290
something what do i usually use i use i normally use a
yamaha ag08 and then they have the yamaha ag03 which is what

62
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:53,550
i had bought and i was like this is perfect it's exactly my
setup i know i like it i know i like i know how to use it

63
00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:04,030
except it just doesn't work for my kind of streaming it like
I said it would be fine on its own it would just you know I

64
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:12,950
don't want to get something and then if I'm traveling you
know last time I traveled I had a collab with like Kiara and

65
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:25,730
Kobo and Ali so I was like wait wait was all wait am I going
crazy all he was in that collab right or am I insane right

66
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:33,110
now no wait who there was one other Wait, yes!

67
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,430
Yeah, okay, I was like...

68
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:36,990
Okay.

69
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,070
Because I remember, because I saw...

70
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,330
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,010
I...

72
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,910
Okay, I remember why I was confused.

73
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,990
It's because I was thinking of Olly's default outfit.

74
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,990
But in the thumbnail, I used her like Otaku outfit.

75
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,350
That's why I was like, wait a second.

76
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,850
So, yeah.

77
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,310
So...

78
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,390
And so...

79
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:10,330
So, um, like, you know, I wouldn't have been able to do that
collab if I had the other interface, you know, things like

80
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,650
that.

81
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,810
I was like, I don't want to say no to stuff just because of
my interface.

82
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:30,270
So, so I got the Go XLR Mini instead, but right now, right
now it's giving me this error, DCP error.

83
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,850
to the most recent version, which I did.

84
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,230
It says, if firmware is up to date, try repairing the driver
with our driver repair wizard.

85
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,770
And I just really don't feel like doing that.

86
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:53,490
And it won't let me into the software to edit anything like
my voice or the noise gate.

87
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,070
So it might sound a little strange.

88
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,910
I apologize.

89
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,650
This is everything is just so scoffed.

90
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,930
I hope my phone's okay, being hotspot.

91
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,770
I pay per gig, so...

92
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,230
Um...

93
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,210
Uh, yeah, I pay...

94
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,770
I pay per gig, so...

95
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,250
Uh, I wonder what we're at.

96
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,440
Um...

97
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,280
Oh, my God, I'm watching the number go up.

98
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,440
Oh, my God, I'm watching the number go up.

99
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,140
Oh!

100
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,460
Guys, I might be cooked.

101
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,680
How much do you pay per gig?

102
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,900
$10?

103
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,360
But it caps.

104
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,060

105
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,520
It caps.

106
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,200
It caps.

107
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,670
Google 5 caps at $80.

108
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:23,430

109
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:32,290
i'm just not gonna think about it everybody because because
i'm i wanted to be here and so that's why i made it happen

110
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:42,310
because i thank you guys thank you because i you know a
couple of days and i want to say hi and things have happened

111
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:51,650
if you didn't catch the twitter space and you're like what
the heck is this debut uh waiting room and what is the heck

112
00:13:51,650 --> 00:14:00,730
is this this this video that is looping and den setu dot exe
what is this so

113
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:18,830
um yeah the the short version is the group that i was going
to debut with we decided to move forward with it um we're

114
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:28,350
having some help backing but we are still indie um we're not
corpo or anything i just have a manager now which is kind of

115
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:38,510
nice but um it's just the three of us we're just gonna do
our best and try and do cool things together and that's

116
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:50,870
that's that's it um things are still gonna be pretty same
for like all the content that i do and um uh so just

117
00:14:50,870 --> 00:15:05,290
probably more like you know hopefully more shows hopefully
more uh opportunities um so yeah It's Steiner managing the

118
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:05,950
three of us.

119
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,270
Steiner is Phoebe's manager.

120
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,610
He's been managing her.

121
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,850
He's been very nice.

122
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,110
And very helpful.

123
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,010
But, uh, underground idol group.

124
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,050
That is probably the best way to put it.

125
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,270
It's like an underground idol group.

126
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,730
Is it actually just Steiner?

127
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,510
We do have a small team.

128
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,790
But, like, Steiner is, like, our main manager.

129
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,290
Hmm.

130
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:45,050

134
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,470

139
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:22,550

of awkward to how do you say every the other two debut but

Yeah.

149
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,030
Yeah, it's all pretty much, everything's pretty much staying
the same.

150
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,830
Just a little bit of extra support in the back end and a
little, maybe a little shinier.

151
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,030
I have maybe some new updated things.

152
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,350
So, yeah.

153
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,750
It'll still be, it'll still feel a little bit new, but also
the same.

154
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,870
So that's it.

155

318
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,590
So I've never seen Superman 3.

319
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,950
I'm safe, I'm safe.

320
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,570
Movie name, office space.

321
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,670
Guys, I'm so sleepy on this one.

322
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,650
It was directed by the creator of King of the Hill.

323
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,530
It's probably pretty good.

324
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,970
I am a yonder.

325
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,350
I'm sorry.

326
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,190
Oh, yeah, yeah.

327
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,450
It's really funny.

328
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,970
Deaf recommend for the former office gal.

329
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,230
I've worked several offices.

330
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,590
Actually, I'd say three and then no four.

331
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,750
Four offices.

332
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,110
Not four office jobs in my afterlife.

333
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,410
I've had many jobs.

334
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,050
I literally...

335
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:24,490
Okay, guys, I don't know if I've ever said this before
either, but like one time I got a job at a Japanese company.

336
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:38,670
and um i literally did that thing where the whole almost the
entire interview was in japanese and but it was a japanese

337
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:54,230
company in the united states and i literally did that thing
where it's like when you when you put your your when you

338
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:06,350
When you, when you, when you, when you put that you are
Nihongo Jozu, but, or like, you know, when you lie on your

339
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,430
resume, I literally did that.

340
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,950
And during the interview, they asked me questions.

341
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,610
And then I answered something.

342
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,190
And it totally got them on another tangent.

343
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,850
Because, so basically, I could not understand it all.

344
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,850
Like, I couldn't understand, like, the mechanical jargon
that they used.

345
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,070
But then they asked me another question, and I answered
that.

346
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,950
And then...

347
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:42,370
And then they started talking a lot.

348
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:45,990
And...

349
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,250
And then the interview was over.

350
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,670
And they were like, okay, cool, you got the job.

351
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:02,350
I did, I maybe spoke like three words in this interview.

352
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,550
Like,

353
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,110
I literally, it was just probably like, Oh, hi.

354
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,710
So they were like, You're hired.

355
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,430
Literally fake it till you make it.

356
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,590
But the job was kind of hell.

357
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,730
Because...

358
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,950
The entire...

359
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,850
Okay, so how do I explain?

360
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,410
I was like a middle...

361
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:41,230
Even now, I don't really understand what I got hired to do.

362
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,990
So like, how do I explain?

363
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,910
Okay, how do I explain?

364
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,370
It was like... Okay.

365
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,430
They kind of...

366
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,500
It was like shipping...

367
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,800
Parts?

368
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:22,260
to shipping like machine parts to other companies is like
the best way that i can describe it and so my job the girl

369
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:38,320
who trained me trained me for a week and then she was like
i'm out see ya and it was like uh logistics logistics Yes.

370
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,300
Yes.

371
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,320
Yeah.

372
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:58,180
My job, though, was to, to make educated guesses on how long
the things would take to arrive at the, at the company.

373
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,460
And I was like, how do you know?

374
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,660
And she would be like, well, you see, there's a boat.

375
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:26,540
and it literally is just vibes guessing the job and like i'd
be like okay and apparently she was like the best she could

376
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:39,320
guess things down to like a day or something she was so good
she was a prodigy I was like, well, how do you know?

377
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,260
And she was like, the boat comes.

378
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,440
And I'm like, okay, but like, yeah?

379
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,920
And she's like, you just have to feel it.

380
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,460
And I'm like, what?

381
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,840
And so then she left and I would be stuck there like,

382
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,000
what am I doing?

383
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:14,700
And, and, um, Safe to say, I didn't last very long.

384
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,680
There was like a whole spreadsheet of boats.

385
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,540
And you would have to like look at like the longitude and
the latitude of the boat.

386
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,260
And then be like, okay, this is where the boat is at.

387
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,740
And then guess.

388
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,200
And then fill out the spreadsheet.

389
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:50,480
like of like this is this is how long it will take before
it's there and you had people every day and she would just

390
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:59,480
the girl training me she would be like oh yeah like kumiko
sama she's crazy she will message you she will email you

391
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:11,860
every day asking how much longer and i just subtracted a day
because it's the next day So if it's 30 days, the next day

392
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,620
that she emails you, you say 29.

393
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,480
It just works.

394
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,380
That was a job that I had, you guys.

395
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,700
Like, a real job.

396
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,640
That was a real job that I had.

397
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,380
Oh, geez.

398
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:57,060
And they would get really mad at you if your predictions
were not correct about how long it would take for these

399
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,140
things to arrive.

400
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,820
Um, I feel like they trolled you or something.

401
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,280
It was very, I, it was, it was very, it was a very strange
job.

402
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,820
I wasn't as good as the girl that trained me.

403
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,860
She was a prodigy guesser.

404
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,440
She could just she like sensed it in her little brain.

405
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,200
She had like an antenna coming out of her head that could
communicate with the boat.

406
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,240
I heard fake it till you make it.

407
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,560
But never fake it till you fake some more.

408
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,620
It's yeah.

409
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,220
Yeah.

410
00:43:52,640 --> 00:44:04,160
office meant be like hi so and yeah i guess like japanese
was not like a super requirement but they would talk to me

411
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:14,280
in in japanese and i'm like i'm i'm i'm literally slaving
away at my desk literally measuring latitude and longitude

412
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,980
of these boats and they're like Konnichiwa, Minto-san?

413
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,220
Gengi desuka?

414
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,920
And I'm like, down to like millimeters.

415
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,140
Maybe their question was, hmm, yeah, she looks like a
Kan-Kole fan.

416
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,100
You can sense the boat.

417
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,460
Yeah, they thought I had boat sense.

418
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,520
But the great part was, it was it was pretty close to the
old maid cafe that I was haunting.

419
00:44:46,760 --> 00:45:05,060
So, um, so yeah it was a I yeah I was pretty close and then
it was it was a job yeah it was a job and I needed one yeah

420
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:22,100
yeah and I remember I had that job and I remember applying
for other jobs being like i can't do this i can't i am not a

421
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:32,520
boat psychic i can't do this i don't understand i'm not the
boat whisperer and so i was like putting in other job and i

422
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:43,640
remember i got a i finally had gotten a job uh at another
place that was like over an hour away and i took it because

423
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,860
of a commute.

424
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,240
And so I took that because that's how desperate I was to get
away from the boats.

425
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,440
I was desperate.

426
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,320
Oh, great Minto of the boat.

427
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,200
What is my numbers to win the lottery?

428
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,760
Give me your longitude and latitude right now.

429
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,680
And I got you, buddy.

430
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,920
I got you.

431
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,400
Out of morbid curiosity, how much did this job pay?

432
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,120
Great question.

433
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,160
I can't remember.

434
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,520
But I believe it was like 13, 14 an hour.

435
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,290
Yeah.

436
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,170
Um, yeah.

437
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,370
Hmm.

00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:42,650
Yeah.

Full time.

441
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:55,780
Full time.

442
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,600
I

443
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,610
still think it's badass that you hired with only three
words.

444
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:11,410
Thank you.

445
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,170
Thank you.

446
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,110
13 an hour in the 80s

447
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:32,930
whoa the coordinates I wonder where that shows

448
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:45,030
the 1800s hey how old do you think I am there were no maid
cafes in the 1800s Only real maids.

449
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,070
Oh my gosh.

450
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,590
Jay Hurton, thank you.

Akadono.

Thank you for all your recommendations.

454
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,450
Jam is probably my favorite maid cafe so far, and I will go
back again.

455
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,330
This is extra cash I managed to save from the claw machines.

456

Good job.

462
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:27,470
To learn that Minto is once an office lady is pretty
appealing to me.

I love office lady aesthetic.

464
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,750

511
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:36,670
I once had a job where my manager was blatantly stealing
money from the safe on camera without even thinking.

512
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,310
Or without even trying to hide it.

513
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,610
Not sure what he was thinking.

514
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:40,670

00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:23,770

aquaculture business.

541
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,290
I would also have to take the mail to the mailbox, which was
down a long dirt road.

542
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,530
I would race the company dog off foot.

543
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:55,550
What?

544
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,530

547
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,830

00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,500
Double dipping.

You're already here.

575
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,110
Oh, I explained it at the beginning of the stream, but I'll
say it again.

576
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:46,310
Basically because Vicky and Phoebe are debuting, I am
also...

577
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:51,790
be kind of weird for only the two of them we're kind of like
just doing it as like a formality it's really just to be

578
00:58:51,790 --> 00:59:03,690
like look at us you know we're we're a group now we're group
together and uh and it's kind of like you know and just like

New model.

582
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,500
If only.

583
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:41,080
The debut was supposed to happen so long ago that I was
supposed to debut my second outfit at it.

584
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,200
Like, that's how long ago it was supposed to happen.

585
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,360
So.

586
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,040
Yeah.

587
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,160
But it's okay.

588
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,000
Everything.

589
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,180
I feel, I feel, we're, you know, we're just chilling.

590
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,580
I mean, we're not chilling.

591
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,920
We are working hard.

592
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:20,840
But it almost feels like we're chilling just because it's
like, you know, we have had a lot of time to hang out and

593
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,820
get to know each other.

594
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,420
And we're just, we're just all goofy together.

595
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,660
So, to me, it, it.

596
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:40,260
almost feels like chilling because i'm like i'm feeling like
relaxed with them because they're my friends so yeah yeah

597
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:51,520
yeah maybe i'm just also feeling relaxed in the moment
because i'm sleepy so i'm like you know i'm very excited but

598
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,620
i'm also like yeah he's cute

599
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,360
It's cute.

600
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,380
We're vibing.

601
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,600
Yeah.

602
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,360
So that hopefully, if that didn't explain it completely, you
can listen at the beginning of the stream.

603
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:14,960
Yeah.

604
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,580
Fun times ahead.

605
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:21,340
So.

606
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,340
Hope you're still having fun even though it's work.

607
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,820
I'm having so much fun.

608
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:35,780
can't wait for you guys to see the work that is happening at
the very moment um but i always still feel bad that like i

609
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:47,180
i've been talking to other people about it recently just
like when i'm gone for when i when i leave for when i have

610
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:57,660
to like you know leave my maid cafe to go do work outside
like the guilt is that you know i can't stream i'm working

611
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:09,040
but i can't stream so it feels like i'm not working and so
it's it's like a it's like a weird you know obviously like

612
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:17,300
i'm doing stuff but you won't see it for like a long time
from now so oh my gosh unreal citizen thank you so much for

613
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:30,380
the akashama thank you so it's like a strange feeling how
like it's like you know i'm doing stuff but it's not

614
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:39,880
streaming for me streaming always remains my number one
priority and that will continue you know that's why i bring

615
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:50,500
my laptop when i'm traveling and things like that so even if
it's like a little one-hour yapping session it still is you

616
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:59,640
know just something to you know talk to you guys say hi give
you company if you want a background stream or anything like

617
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:08,380
that so that's why i'm very uh let's you know it's not
everybody's mindset but it's definitely my mindset

618
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:22,860
yeah yeah yes yes the stream refreshed me fully really talk
about logistics and cheese

619
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:34,200
but also i've talked about this with people too i feel like
especially to do these kinds of yapping sessions like back

620
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:46,920
when i did have my my office job i would go out and i would
do things and i would have stories to talk about you know

621
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:56,240
it's like i can only tell my my five-year-old stories so
many times before you know obviously there's always going to

622
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:03,740
be someone new in chat that's never heard a story before but
you know there's there's only so many times i can reuse

623
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:11,000
these old stories so i have to go out and and experience
things so that i have new things to tell you guys and talk

624
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:21,340
to you about you know what i mean so it's it's a bit of a
balance it's a bit of a balance it's kind of like a strange

625
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,750
thing that you know i'm also thinking about

626
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:45,950
new hauntings exactly why do you always have to stream when
i'm sleeping i'm sorry that's just that's just about

627
01:04:45,950 --> 01:05:01,250
schedule gotta go live your life but i'm not living what do
i i gotta go That's what it would feel like to be living.

628
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,210
Live your afterlife?

629
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,970
You gotta go after live.

630
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:20,310
Exactly.

631
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,190
Just a little bit sometimes.

632
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:31,910
But that's also sometimes why I play so many games and don't
do very many like talking streams is because Because I'm

633
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:32,730
like, oh gosh.

634
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,970
Sometimes I'm, you know, I'm like, what if I run out of
things to talk about?

635
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:38,630
I don't know.

636
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,170
When I play game, I can talk about game.

637
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:49,210
I now curse you with...

638
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,490
What did you curse me with?

639
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:53,070
With an interesting afterlife.

640
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:53,970
No!

641
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,920
Saving up stories for the winter like nuts.

642
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,040
Oh my gosh, I saw a fat squirrel.

643
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:17,020
that guy was huge i'll be like i also saw a squirrel that
was in a trash can and he was like poking his head out and

644

01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,500

647
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,500
I think those guys are funny.

648
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:54,760
Good night, Minto.

649
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,800
Thanks for the stream.

650
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,220
Good night.

Can you say Jaguar?

654
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:03,860
Why?

655
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,920
Get a job as a chicken nugget expert.

656
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,100
Now, what makes an expert on chicken nuggets?

657
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:19,040
The first thing that popped into my head was like finding
chicken nuggets that resemble shapes of things.

658
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:30,780
You know, like I could be an expert and say like this
chicken nugget definitely looks like a picture of Michael

659
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,260
Jackson.

660
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:39,760
And people would look at it and be like I see Michael
Jackson

661
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,820
Abraham Lincoln Yes

662
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:12,720
Yes Oh my gosh That would be like a fun museum Going to a
museum of preserved foods That look like things or people

663
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:23,580
but like not like a dino nuggy that is shaped into it but
like they just took it out of the bag and wham bam thank you

664
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:38,540

665
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,000

666
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,640
They're all donations!

667
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,480
Donate to your local arts!

668
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,420
We're a museum!

669
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,780
I'm starting this right now.

670
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,940
Have you ever had a food item that looks like something?

671
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,960
Give it to me right now.

672
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,800
So I can preserve it in its best state.

673
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,780
And then display it in my museum of oddities.

674
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,040
Of chicken nugget shapes.

675
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,280
and other food items.

676
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:25,140
Chicken nugget shapes that look like people or things and
other food items.

677
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,440
That's the name of my museum.

678
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,540
Haunted Jesus Toast would be a museum of haunted Jesus
Toast.

679
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:42,060
Do you not remember that each chicken McNugget had an avatar
that represented them?

680
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:42,460
What?

681
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,200
I have no idea what you're talking about.

682
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,320
What is that?

683
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,590
Pizza with pineapple.

684
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:03,730
We can't, we're not just, we're not just, we're not just
putting pizza with pineapple in the museum.

685
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:05,030
We have standards.

686
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,290
Cheetos shaped like a dragon.

687
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:08,170
Thank you.

688
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:09,130
Yes, we accept it.

Please send it to me right now.

691
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,330
Please send me your Cheeto in the shape of a dragon.

692
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:26,280
That will be our, that will be our, uh, our monthly main
exhibit.

693
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:46,040
in fact oh my gosh oh my gosh wait hold on what if what if
you found um like how many are there of those stone warrior

694
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:58,800
statues what are they called the terracotta the terracotta's
army the terracotta soldiers What if you found...

695
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,700
Like...

696
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,840
What if you found like...

697
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,520
Hmm...

698
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,640
A hundred Cheetos that looked like...

699
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,840
You found a hundred individual Cheetos that looked like...

700
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:16,680
Wait.

701
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:24,470
And each one looked like a terracotta soldier.

702
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:26,690
And then you displayed them.

703
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:41,220
that's that's just as interesting as going to the real thing
no in fact i would say it's maybe more impressive because

704
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:51,880
you would have to dig through hundreds of thousands maybe
even millions of cheetos to find enough to create a

705
01:11:51,880 --> 01:12:06,160
terracotta army replica army next cam stream I open, I open
1,000 bags of Cheetos looking for one that looks like one

706
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,590
terracotta army soldier.

707
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,850
The chance is not zero.

708
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:14,190
Exactly!

709
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:21,230
And that's why, that's why it's going to be my mission.

710
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:31,130
I'm going to become a terracotta army soldier, Cheeto
soldier, finding.

711
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,090
YouTube account.

712
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,810
This is actually what my new debut is.

713
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:38,750
I'm rebranding.

714
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:43,870
The reason why it's a silhouette is because literally my new
model is a Cheeto.

715
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,090
My whole new look?

716
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:50,050
Cheeto.

717
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:55,250
I look like a, like a gosh darn cheesy puff.

718
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:15,870
rebranding stream need to get some sleep now I'm going to
the Gundam base early tomorrow good night, Minto have fun

719
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:24,210

guessing powers you've got this thank you oh well, thank you

720
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:28,550

721
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:34,070
time for some Minto drop to say hi I'm back to sleep Good
night.

722
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,590
Mint, would you accept this potato chip I just found?

723
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:39,850
Like Haley Joel Osman.

724
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,230
Nope.

725
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:41,770
Well, hmm.

726
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,210
And everyone says I have terrible ideas.

727
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:46,530
Huey!

728
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:47,890
Shut up.

729
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:51,310
I guess I have to accept anything.

730
01:13:51,950 --> 01:14:00,010
But anything that resembles Haley Joel Osman would go, okay,
you know how Zach Baggins has his museum of haunted things?

731
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:07,850
and it's like you have to sign a waiver to go in and you
have to like you know spooky things might happen to you this

732
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:19,710
is the same exact thing if you were to view it's like okay
it's like you see the haley joel osman chip potato chip it

733
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:29,570
might be like the movie from the ring and you might have
seven days and you might die after you look at it it's

734
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:48,130
literally just basement exhibit room for Haley Jalazment
food it might it might just be like an actual cursed object

735
01:14:48,130 --> 01:15:01,930
the Haley Jalazment Cheeto is a biohazard yes literally to
even handle it I need to be in a hazmat suit special glasses

736
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:08,010
Haley Jalazment Cheeto potato chip would belong that would
just be an SCP

737
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:22,110
what did he do to you to be cursed well his face is just a
little too small for his big fat head and it makes me really

738
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:30,690
uncomfortable and that's why I don't like him hmm

739
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:53,030
hmm that's about it I do remember you saying that before.

740
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:56,130
He can't help it.

741
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,550
Give him a second chance.

742
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,110
