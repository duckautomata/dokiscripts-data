1
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:18,960
I had some food earlier and I think it like is all gooped up
in my throat it's so gross to say

2
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,860
that's kind of icky to say sorry

3
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,700
First and foremost, I feel like I should probably put a pin
message.

4
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,900
If you are watching the game awards, I don't care.

5
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,040
I forgot about it.

6
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,060
I'll be honest.

7
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:53,180
I know everyone and their mother is doing a watch along, but
please, I don't, please, let's keep the conversation related

8
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,100
to the game.

9
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,960
Thank you.

10
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
Thank you.

11
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,820
Thank you.

12
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,100

the mess

15
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:44,550
I fear if people come in and are kind of obnoxious about it
because you know how people can be where it's just like such

16
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:53,790
and such got announced at the game awards or or such and
such won the game awards that's really great I don't even

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,490
afterlife not really but thank you I I'll just pin this.

19
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,370
Pin message.

20
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:19,430
So everybody, Scarlet answered the call when I asked for a
mod quickly before stream.

21
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,970
So, they'll be our guest mod for today.

22
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,870
Thanks, Scarlet.

23
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,180
Thank you, thank you.

24
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,740
So, yeah, we'll just...

25
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,500
If you see anybody talking about the Game of Wars, I
probably should have put it as like a muted thing.

26
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,640
I really don't care.

27
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
But, it's okay.

28
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,640
If you see anybody...

29
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,400
being a little bit obnoxious about it.

30
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,460
Feel free to time them out.

31
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,060
This game won the Game Award for Best Narrative back in
2017.

32
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,900
I feel like...

33
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,700
I think I confused this game for something else.

34
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,840
I don't know why.

35
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,180
I was just like, oh, this game doesn't seem very like what
I'm interested in playing.

36
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,400
And...

37
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,020
And... So I had never touched it.

38
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,640
I never watched it.

39
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:23,340
anyone play it I don't know literally anything about this
game I think I like I said I think I confused it for

40
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:37,920
something else so the disappearance of Ethan Carter I don't
know that one either maybe but uh yeah so I'm going in

41
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,660
completely blind please no spoilers or anything I saw some
people talking about that...

42
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,740
The, uh...

43
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
I guess the, um...

44
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,240
What's the word?

45
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,520
Subject matters, uh...

46
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,320
The disappearance of Haruki Suzumiya.

47
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,440
That's the one!

48
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,160
Oh my god!

49
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,660
Yeah!

50
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
That's the one I was confusing it for!

51
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,520
Yeah, yeah!

52
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,920
Yeah, L-M- Oh, what was I saying?

53
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,220
Uh...

54
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,660
Uh...

55
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,600
My company give me free buddy.

56
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,560
Yes!

57
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:12,980
Yay!

58
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,000
Thank you!

59
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:23,440
So, going in completely blind, we'll see how it goes.

60
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,600
Content warning for intense subject matter surrounding death
and grief.

61
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,980
Well, I'm dead, too, so...

62
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,660
You know.

63
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,820
I guess, uh...

64
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,260
Yeah.

65
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,060
I guess we're fine.

66
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:54,840
cool I ran out of advice So watch Minto instead Yippee Let's
get into it then Let's play the game Are you grieving

67
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,320
though?

68
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm grieving I'm grieving The The Oh my gosh What was I
eating?

69
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,180
Oh the grape that I dropped on the ground

70
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,020
I'm grieving the grape that I dropped on the ground and I
didn't get to eat.

71
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,100
I'll never...

72
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,040
Sambyoruru.

73
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,100
But my cats...

74
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,360
They walk around.

75
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,680
And...

76
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,900
They step where they shit, so...

77
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,200
It's really hard.

78
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,660
The three-second rule...

79
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,220
They have a lot of hair.

80
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,000
I try to vacuum, but they're littered.

81
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,800
It's just constantly everywhere.

82
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,060
And so, my grape is so delicious and juicy and sour.

83
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,320
Exactly how I like it.

84
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,480
And you know, I say that about my cats, but I let them in my
bed.

85
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,000
I let them sleep with me.

86
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,920
I think.

87
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
I'm covered in cat poo all the time.

88
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,440
Anyway.

89
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,480
Okay, let's play the game!

90
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:46,810
Oh.

91
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,650
What the remains of Edith Finch.

92
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,590
Am I Edith Finch?

93
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,590
Am I playing the game now?

94
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,750
Oh.

95
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:01,370
Oh.

96
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:05,610
Open.

97
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,330
My journal.

98
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,290
Hey, I'm reading something.

99
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,790
Well, this is my journal, right?

100
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,290
Wait, how do I open the journal?

101
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,130
Open, there we go.

102
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,170
A lot of this isn't going to make sense to you.

103
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,270
And I'm sorry about that.

104
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,930
I'm just gonna start at the beginning with the house.

105
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,590
Happy birthday, Amy!

106
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,830
Happy birthday!

107
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,190
Oh, the house.

108
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,670
Wait, does this game have subtitles?

109
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,010
One second.

110
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,030
I, okay, I forgot to change every thing.

111
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,090
Hopefully, hopefully we're okay.

112
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,790
Oh, I don't see any subtitles.

113
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,870
It does?

114
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:51,890
But where?

115
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,070
They show up in-game.

116
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,330
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

117
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:56,690
Okay, okay.

118
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,070
I'll just turn it up a bit.

119
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,250
We can turn the music down, like, a smidgen.

120
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,570
And then we do that.

121
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,310
I finally played Delta my first time playing any MGS game
inspired by you.

122
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,350
Finally got to see the original meeting of Ocelot and stuff.

123
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,090
obsession better.

124
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,070
Yeah.

126
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,610
Someone had put up a chain link fence, but it looked like I
wasn't the first person to hop it.

127
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,970
Oh, okay.

128
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,110
Wait, why are we hopping?

129
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,250
My brother Milton disappeared when I was four.

130
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,410
It was like the house just swallowed him up.

131
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,450
Now she's loud.

132
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,270
Holy cow.

133
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,510
Look at his little crown.

134
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,430
Date missing.

135
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,390
October 23rd, 2003.

136
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,090
May 19th, 1992.

137
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,210
He's last seen in Orca's Island?

138
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,790
Orca!

139
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,110
Orca!

140
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,390
He was 11.

141
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,890
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

142
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,550
Wait, he's 5...

143
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,890
I'm sorry, 4 foot 6 at 11 years old.

144
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,610
Whoa.

145
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,370
Wait, is that running or is zooming in?

146
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,190
Can I walk faster?

147
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,590
I lived here until I was 11, but I wasn't allowed inside
half the rooms.

148
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,430
Uh, yeah, it looks like a OSHA nightmare.

149
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,450
Well, I guess OSHA wouldn't really be involved if it's a
house, but still.

150
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,250
Oh my god, Orca's Island Gazette!

151
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,470
It's full of Yuri.

152
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,170
Help you well, Minta.

153
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,710
Thank you, you too!

154
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,670
Open.

155
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,530
Inside the mailbox were bills from seven years ago.

156
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,510
Marked urgent.

157
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,870
Open immediately.

158
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,640
No one opened them.

159
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,690
Games like this?

160
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,830
What are those?

161
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,510
The games like, what's it called?

162
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,510
Do this too.

163
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,730
It can talk.

164
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,730
Hey there.

165
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,210
You're going to pay these?

166
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,510
I think you're about to lose your house and all you own.

167
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,270
Yeah, like heavy rain.

168
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,430
Yeah, yeah, the Quantic Dream Games.

169
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,230
And David Cage and David Cage.

170
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,270
How do I get out of this?

171
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,890
Oh, okay.

172
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,710
No trespassing.

173
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,830
I've had me back since my brother Lewis's funeral.

174
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,790
But it's always...

175
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,130
Oh, dang.

176
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,550
You think this is real?

177
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,470
I mean, it's my property, you know?

178
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,530
Ribbit.

179
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:08,990
How is the audio?

180
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,410
Just feel free to shout if I need to adjust anything.

181
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,210
Inner will.

182
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,610
My mother left me a key, but didn't tell me what I'd
unlocked.

183
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:17,570
Ah.

184
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,490
Maybe she thought I'd know.

185
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,830
Or she thought the mystery would be enough to bring me back.

186
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,610
Oh.

187
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,730
That and clear?

188
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,030
Okay.

189
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,650
If you're like, Minto, game way quiet.

190
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,890
Feel free to say something.

191
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,250
Orca's Island is an actual place right across from Canada.

192
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,730
What the...

193
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:43,950
Pilgrimage?

194
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,730
We should all go.

195
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,070
No one had driven this way in a long time.

196
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,750
But I saw a few hoof prints.

197
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,430
Hoof prints?

198
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,410
That is a ye old 2000 something.

199
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,330
oh dear

200
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:19,380
I have a few deer around my truth is even after I inherited
the house I never thought I'd come back to it I have a few

201
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:30,620
deer around my maid cafe and I saw one last night I see them
quite often actually I take walks I'm just like haunting

202
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,960
around the neighborhood haunting around the neighborhood Oh
my gosh!

203
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,040
We gotta do Christmas karaoke soon!

204
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,720
Santa baby Minto, she's defrosting.

205
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,880
But, um...

206
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,340
Uh, I saw one last night, actually.

207
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,040
I know my questions about my family, but only the house knew
the answers to.

208
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,460
Excuse me, Edith.

209
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,280
I'm trying to speak.

210
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,260
I saw one last night, and it had...

211
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,360
It had horns!

212
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,000
And I had not seen any of them with horns up until now.

213
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,640
Wait, I wonder where the other pathway went to, though.

214
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,300
I wish I could run.

215
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:15,840
Ribbit.

216
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:16,980
Ribbit.

217
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,640
This place is nice.

218
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,100
The house was exactly like I remembered it.

219
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,080
Well, not that part.

220
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,760
The way I could tell you about it.

221
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,480
Warrens or antlers?

222
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,800
Oh, antlers.

223
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,620
Sorry.

224
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,460
You mean antlers?

225
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,040
Yeah, yeah, antlers.

226
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,460
There's another missing poster in there.

227
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,800
there it's kind of sad not kind of it's quite sad but oh my
god there's a lot of them

228
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:59,160
ribbit ribbit ribbit ribbit ribbit ribbit as a child the
house made me uncomfortable in a way i couldn't put into

229
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:07,320
words um it's like the winchester mansion but worse

230
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,960
Okay, hold on.

231
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm just gonna...

232
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,080
I'm gonna do this.

233
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,080
Real quick.

234
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,000
One second, sorry, guys.

235
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,380
One second.

236
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,440
Bb-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

237
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,620
Hmm?

238
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,540
There we go.

239
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,000
Save.

240
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,420
Okay.

241
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,880
Are you blacklisting the word?

242
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,420
Yes.

243
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,740
I'm already tired of it.

244
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,800
Coladena!

245
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,880
Thank you so much for the bargain, thank you!

246
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,540
Some days, it's easier for me to ignore things, but... I
asked Edie once about the dragon in the pond.

247
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,360
This girl is always interrupting.

248
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,580
She said it killed her husband.

249
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,280
It killed her husband?

250
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,080
I was six.

251
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,180
It seemed like an odd joke to me, even then.

252
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,180
Why do you hate...

253
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,220
Why do you hate the dragon in the pond?

254
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,300
The dragon in the pond killed her.

255
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,120
kill your grandma.

256
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
But, um, yeah, I'm only former human.

257
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,800
You got...

258
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
As a 17-year-old.

259
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,740
Say anything!

260
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,580
I knew exactly what those words were.

261
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,820
I was afraid of the house.

262
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,430
Mito, I don't think you're going to be able to talk much
today.

263
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,450
It seems...

264
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,210
It seems like it.

265
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,890
But yeah.

266
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,110
I was just saying...

267
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,670
Some days, some things are easier to ignore.

268
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,990
Some days, things are easier to ignore for me.

269
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,730
But I've been a little...

270
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,430
Many things on the brain.

271
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,450
So I'm a little frazzled.

272
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,050
And sometimes it's hard for me to ignore things without it
bothering me.

273
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,550
So I just block.

274
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,650
What's going on here?

275
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,130
Doggy door.

276
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,430
Perfect size for me.

277
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,350
Wait.

278
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:42,470
are we oh the doggy door used to be a lot easier when I was
11

279
00:20:46,430 --> 00:21:04,250
the power had been turned off the night we left I didn't
expect her to actually go through the doggy door okay Gary's

280
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,570
potting mix There's so much in here.

281
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,590
Cosmic cuisine.

282
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,330
The pleasures of Japanese cooking.

283
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,670
Okay, someone.

284
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,450
Gordon Ramsay over here.

285
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,070
Anybody?

286
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:17,670
No.

287
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,930
Is this how...

288
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,750
I always thought this was a horror game.

289
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,350
Is it not?

290
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,010
Does this game get spooky?

291
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,810
Oh my god.

292
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,510
The tennis...

293
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,370
There's something...

294
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,640
Wait, I hear creaking, though.

295
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,400
Kind of scary.

296
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,300
Copy.

297
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
Thank you so much for the thank you.

298
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,940
Thank you.

299
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,660
Not spooky, just heavy.

300
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,180
Not horror, horror.

301
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,020
Oh, okay, okay.

302
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,240
Thank you so much for the gifted.

303
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:52,280
There's something so extremely nostalgic about seeing a
tennis ball on like the garage cord like what?

304
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,000
The cord is connected to nothing.

305
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:54,960
Wait.

306
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,660
But did you guys have families that did that too that would
put a tennis ball on the...

307
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,780
Oh wait, who raided?

308
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,620
Thank you for the ra- Oh, VB!

309
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,940
Hi!

310
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,120
Thank you, Jace, for the five gifts, and thank you.

311
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,140
I call this nostalgic horror.

312
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,020
Oh, God.

313
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,980
So it just makes you sad and old?

314
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,780
For the first time in years.

315
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,660
Yeah?

316
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,300
I felt like I was home.

317
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,440
Ray Mack, thank you.

318
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,900
2010, so they left in.

319
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,980
Oh, look, here we go.

320
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,300
Eddie, Dawn, Lewis, Milton, Edith.

321
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,140
Oh, they're eating lots of beans.

322
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,520
Or canary?

323
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,220
Canary?

324
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,580
Canary?

325
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,360
What are they eating?

326
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,740
Tuna?

327
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,710
But instead of a family, there were just memories of one.

328
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,050
Oh, beautiful and sad.

329
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,690
Oh.

330
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,010
In loving memory of Louis Finch.

331
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,970
November 21st, 2010.

332
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,730
Beloved brother to Edith, son of Dawn.

333
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,190
Great grandson to Eddie.

334
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,570
Oh, look.

335
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:22,650
Lewis.

336
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,830
Oh, gosh, there's so many names here.

337
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,870
Okay, I'm going to do my best, you guys.

338
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,290
I'm...

339
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,370
When they give me so many names like this, I'm going to be
in trouble, maybe a little bit.

340
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,590
For the house being abandoned for so long, though, it looks
great.

341
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,890
Apple pie!

342
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,490
You don't really have to worry about remembering?

343
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,090
I don't?

344
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,490
Okay.

345
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:56,690
the table was still a wreck from the night we left why did
they leave in such a hurry like what's going on here that

346
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:04,650
doesn't like a bomb had gone off killing everyone but
sparing the furniture that's a little that's a little brutal

347
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,350
oh it's wine okay

348
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:23,760
they love Chinese food so glad you're playing this as one of
my faves yeah I'm excited to check it out Tissues prepared?

349
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,100
Wait, I don't have tissues.

350
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
None, thank you, but please don't.

351
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,020
Thank you.

352
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,260
Nothing in the house looked abnormal.

353
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,840
There was just too much of it, like a smile with too many
teeth.

354
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,020
Oh, they had a pet even.

355
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,160
Even the fireplace had a story.

356
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,280
Edie told me the bricks came from the original house after
it sank.

357
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,120
Sank?

358
00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:12,800
oh my god get this house away from the the the lake okay
there's so much stuff it's just clutter everywhere there's

359
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:26,220
so much stuff what's this Barbara the tennis ball was a grip
to prevent thieves people could stick a coat great Sven

360
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,280
builds a music box for Barbara along with the rest of the
house wait seriously

361
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:49,130
oh my gosh the Yeti watch out watch out behind you watch out
there's a there's a Bigfoot behind you I kind of want the

362
00:25:49,130 --> 00:26:01,650
Barbara Bigfoot music box Barbara Finch she's a movie
director of the basement so I wasn't too surprised when the

363
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:13,550
key didn't fit ah okay I was thinking can we unlock the
front door now instead of going in in through the doggy door

364
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:22,670
like a like a savage my mom wasn't much of an optimist but
she never stopped believing that my brother Milton was alive

365
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,710
Where'd he go?

366
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,830
What happened to him?

367
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,590
No mail for Milton!

368
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,670
Wait, that's so kind of...

369
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,370
What 11-year-old is getting mail anyway?

370
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,050
A lot of things got left behind in the whirlwind of that
last night.

371
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Whoa!

372
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,940
Wait, is this sealed?

373
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,680
Eadie told me once that every Finch who ever lived is buried
somewhere in the library.

374
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,140
Uh, Milton?

375
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,780
Milton, you in there?

376
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,440
Whoa.

377
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,720
It's kind of freaky.

378
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,180
I wouldn't want to know that.

379
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,440
As a child, that would make me very afraid.

380
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,600
After Milton disappeared, Mom sealed up all the bedrooms.

381
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,060
Then Edie retaliated and drilled peepholes.

382
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,590
Why would she seal up the bedrooms, though?

383
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,470
Oh, God!

384
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,290
would scare me every night.

385
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,330
That is terrifying.

386
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,490
Look at... Oh, my God!

387
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,710
Oh,

388
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,760
my God.

389
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,040
I guess we know what happened to Milton.

390
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,520
Like, imagine in the dark.

391
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,160
No, thank you.

392
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,320
Whose room is this?

393
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:54,900
Molly.

394
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,260
Molly always seemed like a girl I could imagine being
friends with.

395
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,700
If she hadn't died.

396
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,740
in 1947.

397
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,240
Definitely haunted.

398
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,740
Wait, so they just sealed up her room?

399
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,840
So if you die, your room gets sealed?

400
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,960
Is that what happens?

401
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,120
I don't hate the concept.

402
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,200
I think it's kind of neat.

403
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,060
You just keep building the house.

404
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,500
Someone dies.

405
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,400
You built another room.

406
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,700
Okay.

407
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,560
for them.

408
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,280
Barbara was a child star for two years.

409
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,880
Until America grew out of it.

410
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,220
Oh, wait, there's a bigfoot!

411
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,720
Oh my gosh, it really is a bigfoot and little girl!

412
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,430
Okay.

413
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,990
Oh.

414
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,330
Wow.

415
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,050
Oh, that's so cute.

416
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,810
She's like painting her own room.

417
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,090
Ugh.

418
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,210
Edie's father, Odin, built the original house.

419
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,930
You were one of the voices telling her to keep building.

420
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,170
The movie is called My Friend with Bigfoot.

421
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,590
Oh, wait.

422
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,970
My friend Bigfoot.

423
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,490
Why did I just say with?

424
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
I see it now.

425
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,620
Whenever people ask me about my family, the first thing they
always want to know about is Barbara.

426
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,720
Bill Bunting has Bigfoot.

427
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,520
Nice.

428
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,480
Is she a little girl there?

429
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,420
I guess she is.

430
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,040
Oh yeah, I was wondering that guy in the middle.

431
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,160
I just thought...

432
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,060
I just thought he was really ugly.

433
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,420
I wasn't gonna say anything.

434
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,120
I was like, ooh.

435
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,260
Ooh.

436
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,120
But he's...

437
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,000
Now it's okay.

438
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,180
It's just up his big foot.

439
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,220
Also, I remember that room over there.

440
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,880
I'm like exploring the ones that are...

441
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,160
Mom must have locked the third floor stairs on the night we
left.

442
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,560
I just wanted to look around first.

443
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,880
Okay, I guess we go to the fishy room.

444
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,000
Or wait, this one also has some sealed doors.

445
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,580
This one is question not sealed.

446
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,480
This one is not sealed.

447
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,020
Calvin was an astronaut.

448
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,060
Do wonder why they left, though.

449
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,320
Yeah, I guess we'll figure it out.

450
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,740
What's in here?

451
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,360
Calvin.

452
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,460
My grandpa Sam spent seven years sharing a room with his
dead brother.

453
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,480
Calvin.

454
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,440
Oh, Calvin was not an astronaut.

455
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,580
The body was removed, though, right?

456
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,780
Imagine just his mummified body in his bed.

457
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,640
I love books as much as the next person, but this house has
a crap ton of books, right?

458
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,460
There is no way.

459
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,140
There is no way they've gone through all...

460
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,680
There's no way they've read all of these.

461
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,500
It's an insane amount of books.

462
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,660
It's the most books I've ever seen in my entire afterlife.

463
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,320
The Spirit Among Us.

464
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,240
The Spirit Among Us.

465
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,800
Who's this?

466
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,240
Gregory.

467
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,040
Why are they all children?

468
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,260
As a kid, I just assumed every house had peepholes and
sealed rooms you weren't allowed inside of.

469
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:19,800
was a bathroom wait what oh god the shag carpet is really
awful why is gregory uh i have so many questions oh gosh

470
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:30,980

471
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,920
senior's room i was 10 and she was painting my portrait oh
Can we go in?

472
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,060
This one's not sealed.

473
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,560
Let me in.

474
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,140
Hmm.

475
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,460
Okay.

476
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,420
To the one room that's open.

477
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,520
Gregory lives in a pink bathroom, okay?

478
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,040
Okay.

479
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm, you know, I was questioning.

480
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,780
I was about to say I'm not questioning it, but I definitely
questioned it.

481
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,200
I did.

482
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,480
Here we go.

483
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,520
I spent a lot of time playing in Great Uncle Walter's room.

484
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,160
I think my mom sometimes regretted not sealing it.

485
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:19,140
it up why did she seal up the rooms though after Milton
disappeared like what would that do Lewis told me there were

486
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:25,980
secret passages but I never believed him 20,000 leagues
under the sea open up

487
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:39,220
yeah this room's fine turns out my mom was really good at
keeping secrets this place would be a great Airbnb you know

488
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,600
Now it was time to find out what my mom had been afraid of.

489
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,400
Like all the themed rooms and everything, people would go
nutso over this.

490
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,700
This place would be an awful Airbnb.

491
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,480
To each their own.

492
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,340
When the themes on the wall, it was clear my brother Milton
had been here before me.

493
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,900
Oh yeah, it says Milton.

494
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,720
Some people would ruin it.

495
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,780
I guess that's true.

496
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:11,900
Is it crawling?

497
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,440
Reading this, maybe it sounds like I had a plan.

498
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,760
Is it that... I think you could stand.

499
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,440
I don't think the ceiling is that low.

500
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,640
Doggy door, doggy door, doggy door, doggy door.

501
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,140
Look at the door you entered.

502
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,820
Yeah, but like look at the ceiling.

503
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,760
We don't want to crawl anymore.

504
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,460
But I had no idea what was behind that door.

505
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,440
Oh my gosh.

506
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,640
It's, uh, the one girl's room.

507
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,320
Just like I had no idea where all this was going to lead.

508
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,320
Orca's Island cows.

509
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,100
Oh, you think the ants are still in there?

510
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,320
They escaped.

511
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,520
Owl.

512
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,080
I grew up looking at Molly's room through the peephole.

513
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,220
Being inside for the first time, I felt like I'd stepped
behind a painting.

514
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,520
Where is our room then?

515
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,680
Maybe I guess the third floor.

516
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,440
Molly's gerbil had a tiny bedroom with its own even tinier
gerbil cage.

517
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,320
That's so cute!

518
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,180
Oh, oh, I see it.

519
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,260
Oh, I thought the...

520
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,420
Oh, wait, that's so cute.

521
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,280
So the gerbil could go inside?

522
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,560
Oh, I thought there was like a hole drilled into this one
that allowed the gerbil to go inside.

523
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,520
That'd be so cute.

524
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,640
Let's see, what is Molly's?

525
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,560
Okay, Monsters of the Deep?

526
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,100
Okay!

527
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
The Weird Tale?

528
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,460
Magical Realist Fiction?

529
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,900
Okay, Molly.

530
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,800
Molly's got a...

531
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,880
Molly's a little strange.

532
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,120
We like it.

533
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,660
Bedbug.

534
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,860
Bedbug.

535
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,340
Oh.

536
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,540
This room is in, like, a...

537
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:33,620
pristine condition like nothing what if something happens
like what if this window breaks the door is sealed what are

538
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:49,580
you supposed to do Mount Rainier can you get out there's no
dust yeah like it looks like it's been taken care of it says

539
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,700
the mothman or either

540
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,060
I am not judging.

541
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,380
I am saying that she is one of me.

542
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,780
She's one of us.

543
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,220
Hello.

544
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:02,700
Hello.

545
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,300
Thank you so much, dear, for 20 months.

546
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,580
Thank you.

547
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,180
Orcas Island is a real place.

548
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,840
The local sports ball team is called the Vikings, though.

549
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,680
Not the Cavs.

550
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,160
Maybe they...

551
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,060
I got the sense 80 had spent a lot of time here before my
mom sealed the doors.

552
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,060
Oh.

553
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,560
What is that?

554
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,660
Molly, her diary?

555
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,460
Uh-oh.

556
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,620
Oh my god.

557
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,540
December 13th, 1947.

558
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,740
Dear diary, I'll be gone soon, but I wanted to tell somebody
about what's going to happen.

559
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,600
It started when mom sent me to bed without dinner.

560
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,200
I woke up and I was starving, so I looked around for
something to eat.

561
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,580
The gerbil.

562
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,180
No, no, don't do it, Molly.

563
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,040
Molly, don't do it!

564
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,220
I like the... Molly is such a... She's got a little... She's
very curious.

565
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,260
I like it.

566
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,900
I thought about eating Christopher, but I held back.

567
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,940
You held back?

568
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,540
How desperate are you, Molly?

569
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,820
Molly?

570
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,180
The gerbil food was dry, but I didn't mind it.

571
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,140
My Halloween candy was all gone.

572
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,960
I'm in shock.

573
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,340
Mom, can I come out now?

574
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,460
This is...

575
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,480
Sweetheart, it's late.

576
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,520
Go to sleep.

577
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,100
I'm so hungry, I'm eating gerbil food.

578
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,520
I think we should say...

579
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,100
I'm contemplating eating my live pet fish.

580
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,250
Almost two years.

581
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,190
Thank you.

582
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,330
Thank you, thank you.

583
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,050
Wait.

584
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,890
Oh, I can't see anything.

585
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,030
Oh my gosh, it's so dark.

586
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,030
Wait.

587
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:21,750
Please.

588
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,990
How tall?

589
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,250
Why am I so sure?

590
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,870
I kept eating and eating.

591
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,700
I ate a lot of things that night.

592
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,770
Are those real?

593
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,470
I think that's decorative, no.

594
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,100
Aren't those like made of foam usually?

595
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,380
They're not real.

596
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,320
Berries, I don't think.

597
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,260
Then I heard chirping outside my window.

598
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Are you gonna eat the bird?

599
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,400
It was a barn swallow going back to her nest.

600
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,500
Don't do it, Molly.

601
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,280
I reached out for her.

602
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,360
And suddenly...

603
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,240
I was a cat.

604
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,180
Oh.

605
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,920
Oh my gosh.

606
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,160
Best case scenario.

607
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
The sensitivity went like crazy.

608
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,160
Can I jump?

609
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,200
Oh, I can.

610
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,700
I'm purring, I'm purring.

611
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,980
I tried to be quiet, but the bird was really scared.

612
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,880
Where am, where's the bird?

613
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,980
Jump to where?

614
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,660
Oh, there.

615
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,940
Um, up there?

616
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,270
We're going?

617
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,230
Oh, why'd you come to me?

618
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,310
We're the worst cat ever!

619
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,390
I jumped and I almost got her.

620
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,390
Turning into a cat who does that, suddenly anamorphs?

621
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:37,650
I could tell she was getting really tired.

622
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:47,510
I was up in the big tree I promised that I wouldn't climb it
anymore This thing All I cared about was eating that mama

623
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,330
bird You used to climb this thing?

624
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,050
Oh my god

625
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:10,030
That's terrifying I gobbled her up And suddenly I was an owl
First all I heard was the wind Then I heard Little teeth

626
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,510
nibbling in the grass.

627
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,330
Where?

628
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,930
I don't hear anything.

629
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,630
Am I searching for teeth?

630
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,790
Little teeth nibbling in the grass?

631
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:24,870
Rabbits.

632
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,850
Rabbits.

633
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,010
Rabbits this way.

634
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,250
Oh, I see them.

635
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,410
You can't escape me, little rabbit.

636
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,190
Or you can, because I don't know how to go down.

637
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,030
You're mine, little rabbit.

638
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:48,870
it you're mine you're mine too fast too fast oh there's one
oh he's glitching out

639
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:59,010
you're mine you're mine oh there we go i have to do
something

640
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:11,730
i imagined his face looking up and seeing mine through my
talents I pulled him up and I didn't chew one bit.

641
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,510
And then I blew off to find something bigger.

642
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,190
Bigger?

643
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,430
She's her greed.

644
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,650
She's insatiable.

645
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,100
In one bite.

646
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,160
Didn't even savor the rabbit.

647
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,580
A mama rabbit.

648
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,340
A mama rabbit.

649
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,340
Oh, catch two rabbits with only two swoops.

650
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,520
You can miss?

651
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,680
I started choking, but I couldn't stop eating.

652
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,200
Is she hallucinating because of the- Oh my god!

653
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,430
Oh.

654
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:06,970
Uh.

655
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,090
Uh.

656
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,170
Uh.

657
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,010
Uh.

658
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,170
Uh.

659
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,870
Up a

660
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,840
cliff and into the ocean.

661
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,860
Now.

662
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,740
I was hungrier than ever.

663
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,580
Yes, yes.

664
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,860
I see that.

665
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,000
Oh.

666
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,660
I see that little fish.

667
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,360
I see that little fish.

668
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,700
Little fish, little fish.

669
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,080
That's not a fish.

670
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,520
That's a seal.

671
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,580
I wanted fat, juicy seals.

672
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,940
He's right there.

673
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,380
Oh my gosh.

674
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,500
Well, I'm not going to get the achievement on this guy.

675
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:49,600
Oh.

676
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,920
Oh my god.

677
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:08,280
flipper and it tasted really good what about the rest don't
waste food oh there it is tasted really good blood in the

678
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,960
water blood in the water wait I thought we tore it off
though I

679
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:28,460
grabbed on tight but I was so hungry I jumped out of the
water when When I opened my eyes, everything had changed.

680
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,120
Yeah?

681
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,320
What are we now?

682
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,660
We're...

683
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,840
A box?

684
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,060
No, we're still a shark.

685
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:40,740
Wait, what are we?

686
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,680
An octopus?

687
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,320
What are we?

688
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,860
Now I was a monster.

689
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,740
I smelled people everywhere.

690
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,040
Is that Christmas music?

691
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,300
It is, I think.

692
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,500
How timely.

693
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,560
Am I going the right way?

694
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,080
I can't go.

695
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,700
People!

696
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,240
Oh, person!

697
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,220
I moved real wide.

698
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
People!

699
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,220
People!

700
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:32,790
People!

701
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,310
People!

702
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,350
I wanted to stop, but also, I didn't.

703
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,760
In the morning.

704
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,200
Oh, this guy.

705
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,000
This is...

706
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:56,880
Delicious.

707
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,120
Is she...

708
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,060
Oh my god, it's so loud.

709
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,240
Is she even eating them?

710
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,480
Wait, how do I get up?

711
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:31,190
to that guy oh there we go oh that to go around the longest
tentacle in history the last passenger i was still hungry

712
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:37,950
and across the water still something i had to have this is
technically another cannibal game

713
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,230
What am I now?

714
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,370
Oh, I'm still a tentacle.

715
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,550
I slithered onto the sand.

716
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,830
And the good smell went into an old pipe.

717
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,690
Ooh, we call that sewage.

718
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,910
We're gonna go down the pipe.

719
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,230
Up the pipe.

720
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,190
We're still tentacle.

721
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,630
Oh, I'm in the bathroom.

722
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,230
Oh, no.

723
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:03,890
Oh, my God.

724
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,750
She's really freaky.

725
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:06,350
Oh, my God.

726
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,050
It's just like...

727
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,490
Oh, my gosh.

728
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,750
Every girl watching will relate to this.

729
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,290
If you are a girl...

730
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,990
Well, actually, I think, I think boys too maybe, but girls
especially.

731
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:21,470
If you have a dog, like a, and that likes to get through
trash.

732
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,050
I got closer and closer.

733
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:26,730
You know.

734
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,190
Oh, wait, this is her room.

735
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,460
We went through a loop.

736
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,440
Yep, yep, yep.

737
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,880
Am I going the right way?

738
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,260
Wait, is it?

739
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,260
Ah, thank you so much for the raid!

740
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,520
Thank you!

741
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,240
Hello, hello!

742
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,860
As a guy who grew up with two sisters, yeah.

743
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,000
All my stomach started growling.

744
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,160
All of them!

745
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,120
How many you got?

746
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,540
And suddenly, that was me again.

747
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,520
I held my breath for

748
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,610
all of me to fall asleep.

749
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,230
But it's not going to wait much longer.

750
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:27,330
It needs to be, and we both know, I will be delicious.

751
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,520
Thank you guys so much for the gift, and thank you.

752
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,220
Molly?

753
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,520
I'm not sure if I believed all of that, but I'm sure Edy
would have.

754
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,120
Uh-oh.

755
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,760
Okay.

756
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,000
Close the book!

757
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,830
Oh, that was the sound of...

758
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,650
A cat, no?

759
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,290
It is a cat!

760
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:17,170
I think the implication is that Molly died from eating
poisonous mistletoe, and this was a hallucination of her

761
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:17,910
final moments.

762
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,330
Yeah, that would make sense.

763
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:19,810
Oh no!

764
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,230
I... I wanted to look in the bathroom, but I...

765
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:23,770
Okay.

766
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:24,990
My bad.

767
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:25,490
Too bad.

768
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,610
I missed my chance.

769
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,410
This would be obvious later, but my mom never told me any of
these stories.

770
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,490
Edie would have, but mom didn't like bringing up the past.

771
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:42,830
Though, when we adopted a stray kitten, she was the one who
named it Molly.

772
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:43,970
Aw.

773
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:49,490
What?

774
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,860
I spent a lot of time in Great Grandma Edie's room.

775
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,700
Oh, we're in here now.

776
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:06,120
when edie told people sven was killed by a dragon she could
also have said he was building a dragon shape slide that

777
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:20,340
collapsed she could have but she didn't she just wanted to
be all whimsical why did she have so many gnomes thank you

778
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:28,060
so much for the pink p-i-c-a a disorder that causes people
to eat random objects excessively her mom locked to punish

779
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,600
her, but that allowed her to eat stuff unsupervised.

780
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,780
It was an accident.

781
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,780
Oh, I've never heard of that before.

782
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,080
Interpreted as to mean that Molly was undiagnosed P-I-C.

783
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:39,520
Pika.

784
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,560
For now it's like Pika.

785
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,460
Oh, I've never heard of that before.

786
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,380
So I go, thank you so much for the five gifted.

787
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,020
I don't know, though.

788
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:03,020
I feel like she was attempting to eat things that were real
food though, right?

789
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:16,140
Well, I mean, fish is technically a food and the gerbil food
is food for a gerbil and then she tried to eat berries.

790
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,180
Oh, the toothpaste.

791
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,040
It still goes in your mouth, though.

792
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,340
Built 1937.

793
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,900
Sven for Eadie won't go!

794
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:37,580
One summer they evacuated the island, but Eadie refused to
go for a few weeks.

795
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,940
She was a celebrity.

796
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,300
Fifteen cents!

797
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:45,780
Wow.

798
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,860
The mysteries of death and thereafter.

799
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,520
Well, Miss Eadie, I could...

800
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,320
What the...

801
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,980
Eadie gave a big interview about a mole man living under the
Finch house.

802
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,280
mom was furious.

803
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:05,140
Wait, I want to win a family day out at Druid World!

804
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,460
Oh, well, thank you so much for that, so many, thank you!

805
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,940
I hadn't thought of myself as Edith Jr. for a long, long
time.

806
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,040
Oh.

807
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,440

Those view is so nice though.

819
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:42,510
Sims names truly Lewis died a week before we left but Edie
had already started to memorialize him

820
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:56,250
okay tell me if you guys see this too because it's not like
a fully completed painting see where his chin is it looks

821
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:06,670
like a really long dog nose do you guys see Or like, like a
snout of some sort.

822
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:18,930
And he looks like he's giving me a little bit of bedroom
eyes.

823
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:20,790
And he's like, I'm a sexy rat.

824
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,430
Edie knit me a new pair of gloves every year.

825
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,930
Just in time to replace the old ones.

826
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:27,970
Aww.

827
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,750
I can't unsee it.

828
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,670
He had to let me do it for you, dog.

829
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,570
Let me do it for you.

830
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,830
It's a big family, huh?

831
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,030
Holy moly.

832
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,110
Lewis, oh.

833
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,550
Her room was like a museum.

834
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:55,710
Oh, wait.

835
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,590
Isn't that the guy that's in the...

836
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,910
Oh my gosh, another gnome.

837
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,150
Or...

838
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:03,910
Uh...

839
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,000
Okay, here we go.

840
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,060
We're looking through.

841
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:18,540
For 500 years, the Finches have been famous throughout
Norway for their fortune and misfortune.

842
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:28,920
Odin Finch buries the latest victims of the family curse,
his wife Ingeborg and their newborn son, Johann.

843
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:38,900
On January 7, 1937, he set sail with his family and his
house, hoping to leave the curse behind.

844
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,660
That's right, that's just his whole house.

845
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:53,100
on a boat oh my gosh oh but 40 foot waves off the coast of
Washington send the house and Odin to the bottom of the sea

846
00:56:53,100 --> 00:57:03,200
they were Norwegian gnomes are big in that folklore yeah
yeah it's true Odin's daughter Edie with husband Sven and

847
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:13,340
baby Molly step ashore on their new home Orcus Island Odin
Finch is the first to be buried in the new family cemetery

848
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:31,600
did he make it or his daughter edie is already dreaming of a
new finch house oh give me out of here oh sorry give me out

849
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:42,140
there we go the controls in this game are a little
whatever's wrong with this family it goes back a long ways

850
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,740
he drowned in the 40

851
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,220
Like I have to do with my mouse, like I have to swipe it,
you know?

852
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,200
You'll get used to it?

853
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,600
Where do we go from here?

854
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,660
Out the window again?

855
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,460
Wait, there's this door over here, too.

856
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,180
Even in your 90s.

857
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,900
Sometimes Edie seemed a lot younger than my mother.

858
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,040
Aww.

859
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,880
Is that a ghost?

860
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,200
Let me check the window real quick.

861
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:20,250
There's like cords going everywhere.

862
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:22,810
That's you.

863
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,230
Oh, gosh.

864
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,230
We're in Gregory's room.

865
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,710
It's terrible.

866
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,670
The only trace Grandpa Sam's first wife, Kay, left on the
house was the pink bathroom.

867
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:42,370
Oh.

868
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,730
It was a pretty big trace.

869
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,580
It's so terrible.

870
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,020
Oh, cute.

871
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,360
That's, like, fun to play with in the bathtub.

872
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,560
I'm just saying.

873
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,240
Oh, grandma needs the chair.

874
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,220
I think I remember my grandpa having a chair in his shower.

875
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,460
Like that.

876
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,560
I always be like, why?

877
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,600
What is this?

878
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,620
Oh my god.

879
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:14,260
Why would you like have a picture of the death of the house?

880
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,640
Like that.

881
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,620
It's pink.

882
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,760
Yeah, so they don't fall.

883
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,280
Yeah, yeah.

884
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,100
I didn't know why before, but I get it now.

885
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:27,820
There's a secret.

886
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,500
in this bathroom by Sven and Edie Finch.

887
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:41,440
I don't, maybe if you make it really obvious, people will
overlook it, you know?

888
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,140
There's a secret in this bathroom.

889
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:47,980
Oh.

890
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,800
It's in the last place you would look.

891
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,880
It isn't in the cupboard.

892
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,400
It's hidden in this book.

893
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,540
Oh, oh.

894
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,320
Whoa!

895
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,080
So cool!

896
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,480
Calvin Finch.

897
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,060
Some guy.

898
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,620
Sven gave Sam an old camera he'd refurbished.

899
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,460
He never put it down.

900
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,620
Who's Sam?

901
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,500
Is that Sam?

902
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,220
Well, I guess so.

903
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,940
Why is Sam in the...

904
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,820
in the...

905
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,920
in the walls.

906
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,960
Sam is living in the walls.

907
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,280
Didn't mean to disrupt your stream.

908
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,720
Wasn't even my phone saying I didn't notice the thing.

909
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,380
It's okay.

910
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,420
Thank you, though.

911
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,060
You're totally good.

912
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,660
I appreciate it, though.

913
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,380
Thanks, Nan.

914
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,120
Have fun.

915
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,020
Milton.

916
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:55,940
Is that a...

917
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,420
Oh, that's a... Wait.

918
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,020
Does whiskey come in wine bottles like that?

919
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,840
Oh, my gosh.

920
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,320
Is that a beer?

921
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,600
Push.

922
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,840
Where are we now?

923
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,920
Oh, we're in a...

924
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,200
Yeah, the room that he had to share with his dead brother or
whatever.

925
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,740
Oh, that's so sad.

926
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,400
Like, he kept growing, but his brother didn't.

927
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,360
Calvin, yes.

928
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,880
Okay, Sam is the grandpa.

929
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:39,520
Norway is the Atlantic Ocean, so either he sailed the North
Sea, an Arctic Ocean to reach west, or he crossed the

930
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,220
Atlantic, went South America.

931
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,900
Yeah, that's what I was wondering, too.

932
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,380
What?

933
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,000
Why didn't they go to the East Coast?

934
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,340
You can check the diary if you don't remember who's who.

935
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,960
Yeah, thank you, I will.

936
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,420
Fort Sam.

937
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,980
The secret lives of war photographers.

938
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,000
Aww.

939
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,900
This was before Google Maps.

940
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,840
Join and fight.

941
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,740
What's this say?

942
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:19,780
Samuel Finch.

943
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,920
I knew Grandpa Sam had a twin.

944
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,220
Oh, it was a twin?

945
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,520
That's even worse.

946
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,460
They say, they say like twins.

947
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,660
Oh wait, oh my gosh.

948
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,680
I thought that was Doom guy.

949
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,820
Twins are like so connected, you know.

950
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,060
And that he never talked about him.

951
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,020
Tool Command Center.

952
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,700
I guess my grandpa didn't like history anymore than my mom
did.

953
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,120
This is like the coolest room ever, though.

954
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,400
Oh my gosh.

955
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,040
This is the cool...

956
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,400
Wow, this is kind of sad, though.

957
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,760
Not kind of.

958
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:13,580
It's pretty sad.

959
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,000
But this is the coolest room ever!

960
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:25,160
The bridge, the stairs to the bridge to the, to the
spaceship room!

961
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,400
Awesome.

962
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,000
How I Want to Remember My Brother by Sam Finch.

963
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,960
The thing I remember is that when he made up his mind, that
was it.

964
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,460
My brother said he'd die before he ate another mushroom.

965
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:48,960
And he did.

966
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:51,920
Well...

967
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,660
At Barbara's funeral, we swore we'd never be afraid again.

968
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,220
And he wasn't.

969
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:58,960
It's making me a bit dizzy.

970
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,880
I think Calvin always wanted to fly.

971
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,780
He kept his promise.

972
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,160
Come!

973
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:08,620
Calvin!

974
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,260
Jeno's ready!

975
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,440
Coming!

976
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,340
But that day, he finally made up his mind to do it.

977
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:17,620
Oh my god!

978
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,440
I told him going around was impossible.

979
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,900
He already has a leg broken.

980
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,800
Maybe if I hadn't said that.

981
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,300
Oh my god, oh my god!

982
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,380
God, oh my God.

983
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,160
Every kid tried to do this, though.

984
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,860
I think, you know.

985
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,600
Maybe he's one time picked up.

986
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,560
Oh my God.

987
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,400
And maybe he'd still be here.

988
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,280
Oh my God.

989
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:44,920
But I don't.

990
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,540
I think he'd already made up his mind.

991
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,880
The swing over a cliff.

992
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,320
That's what I want to remember about my brother.

993
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,200
There's many questionable decisions here.

994
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,540
Oh my god!

995
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,080
Oh my god!

996
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,100
Hold on, Calvin!

997
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,360
Calvin's story felt strangely familiar.

998
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,760
When I was younger, I remember trying to do the exact same
thing.

999
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,520
Yeah, every kid did, right?

1000
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,560
What a legend.

1001
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,420
Holy cow!

1002
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:38,620
Whoever told me that you can control this stuff with arrow
keys?

1003
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,400
Thank you.

1004
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,640
Instead of, like, trying to close the book with my mouth.

1005
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,660
Edy roped off Calvin's half of the room.

1006
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,920
What's in here?

1007
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,680
He actually did it, the madman.

1008
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,540
Wait, this is so cute too.

1009
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:06,590
Cool.

1010
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,850
Whoa!

1011
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,980
This house is insane.

1012
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,280
Oh my gosh, those aren't even real books I just noticed.

1013
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,260
They're painted on.

1014
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,480
We're back in the walls.

1015
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:23,800
Eek!

1016
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:24,920
Spooky.

1017
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,620
The passages were a pretty tight fit.

1018
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,520
They'd obviously been built for smaller hands and bellies.

1019
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,840
Every kid did to fly off a cliff to avoid eating mushrooms
for dinner.

1020
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,500
So real.

1021
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,240
Oh, OK, we're here.

1022
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:42,720
OK.

1023
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,550
But why is there so much?

1024
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:49,530
What is that?

1025
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,790
Why is there so much alcohol in here?

1026
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:54,070
If it's made for children.

1027
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,810
Okay, okay.

1028
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,890
We open up our little shortcut.

1029
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,110
Alright, there we go.

1030
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,490
Growing up, I always thought of Barbara as a child star.

1031
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:20,730
Is that not what she was?

1032
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,030
I thought there was a highlight on the bra, no?

1033
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,070
Am I just seeing what I wanted to see?

1034
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,030
I could have sworn there was.

1035
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:35,010
like a little

1036
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:56,610
I know I saw it I saw it no there was right the prompt to
climb out uh oh imagine making one movie and them making a

1037
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:59,530
doll out of you because it was like such a famous movie

1038
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:07,600
the music in here is Like the ambiance is...

1039
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,320
Macaulay Colkin?

1040
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,780
Oh, I guess you're right.

1041
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,920
But he was in a series of movies.

1042
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,060
The Home Alone series.

1043
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,340
Like the Wizard of Oz.

1044
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,960
No, I don't... That's a...

1045
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,920
Julie Gar...

1046
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,040
Garland, right?

1047
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,620
Julie Gar... Right?

1048
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,260
Judy.

1049
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,320
Judy Garland, yeah.

1050
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,280
I don't count her, because she was in quite a bit of stuff.

1051
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,020
I mean, obviously, the Wizard...

1052
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:48,300
But the Wizard of Oz is, like, a technical masterpiece.

1053
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:54,900
Oh, my gosh, I love learning about, like, the tech, not the
tech, but, like, you know, the cinematography.

1054
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,920
Just everything that went into making the Wizard of Oz is...

1055
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,760
It's kind of insane, and also so...

1056
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,280
Amazing.

1057
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,180
Like, the part...

1058
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:22,500
thing is um is uh the part where it goes from the sepia to
color there's a part where she has to like open the door and

1059
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:30,900
it goes into the color the part right before that it looks
like it's in like the sepia tone but it's just the lighting

1060
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:36,560
and like the special effects that they had to do like they
put her like in a different outfit and stuff it's so cool

1061
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:48,260
It's so, oh my gosh, it's like so, like the way that they
had to technically do that is just, oh my god.

1062
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,500
Didn't the guy who played the Tin Man get super cancer from
the makeup?

1063
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,740
I think that is, I'm not sure about cancer.

1064
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,140
I've heard that it's poisonous, but I think there were parts
of that that were exaggerated.

1065
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,360
Yeah, practical effect, that's what I was thinking of, thank
you.

1066
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:16,780
did not he did not die from the paint that is a rumor he
died from old age you guys it's incorrect that he died from

1067
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:39,080
the paint yeah yeah so he died of rust so sad such is the
life of a tin man swan lake this thing though i don't know

1068
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,960
do you think this movie would be I was, well, you know what,
I was gonna say, I don't think this movie would be popular,

1069
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:50,460
but also in the Wizard of Oz, the costumes are kind of scary
too, so, you know, never mind, I don't know.

1070
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,200
I never thought about how hard it must have been for her
afterwards.

1071
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:09,410
Is that a role, or is that, like, is this a costume for a
movie, or is it a, uh, her actual work uniform, I wonder.

1072
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:12,390
Oh, it was her birthday?

1073
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,390
Birthday, Barbara.

1074
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,790
Barb Street.

1075
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,550
Why'd she have that on her bed?

1076
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:24,130
This is such a cute room, though.

1077
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:26,490
Free cake!

1078
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,150
Guy and a speedo.

1079
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:40,590
And popcorn that is so old, it's fused together.

1080
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,670
That is popcorn, right?

1081
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,210
It's got...

1082
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:45,530
What?

1083
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,170
I don't...

1084
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,690
Can popcorn get that way?

1085
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,850
How is the cake still in...

1086
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:51,730
Well, the cake isn't really intact.

1087
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,030
It's kind of moldy.

1088
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,290
No, popcorn looks like an alien creature.

1089
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:02,610
Dreadful stories.

1090
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,830
Guest starring Barbara Finch.

1091
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,970
Of all the stories people wrote about Barbara's death, I'm
surprised Edie saved this one.

1092
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:11,830
About her death?

1093
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:13,210
Wait, that's messed up.

1094
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:24,510
Oh my gosh, these dang true crime podcasters coming in oh
jack here with another ghastly tale inspired by america's

1095
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:36,210
most unfortunate family i'm calling it the surprise ending
of barbara finch is this guy supposed to be the crypt keeper

1096
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:50,390
as a child star barbara was famous for her scream now at 16
she was all washed up her has been oh my god she's just

1097
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:59,690
living her life she'd been asked to perform her signature
scream at a local convention for monster movie fans it was

1098
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:07,920
just the boost her career needed not beast econ his scream
hadn't aged well

1099
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:21,250
getting better i think you just need the right motivation
biggest fan and current boyfriend, Rick, was about to

1100
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,030
demonstrate when...

1101
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:27,810
Now that was a great scream.

1102
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,130
It was Barbara's father.

1103
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:36,170
Sven, he'd slipped into a table saw and had to be rushed to
the emergency room.

1104
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:41,790
So Barbara got stuck babysitting her youngest brother,
Walter.

1105
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:45,130
Her convention comeback was cancelled.

1106
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:52,650
Okay, I'm hearing frustration, but I'm not hearing terror.

1107
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,990
What if I tried?

1108
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,390
A gang of hoodlums in Halloween masks have been terrorizing
Orca's Island tonight.

1109
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:58,030
Oh my god!

1110
01:13:58,150 --> 01:13:59,650
Everything is happening all at once!

1111
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:00,630
Oh my god!

1112
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:01,830
That came from the basement!

1113
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,050
You're right!

1114
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:03,690
You're right!

1115
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,730
Also, I loved your delivery on that.

1116
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,450
Why is your basement door locked?

1117
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:09,030
Why is your basement door locked?

1118
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:11,110
Because my dad likes making puzzles and secret passages.

1119
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,690
There's a key hidden in the music box.

1120
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:14,570
Oh!

1121
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:21,290
and winding until finally the key pops up.

1122
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,050
Thanks, babe.

1123
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:22,670
Thanks, babe.

1124
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:23,410
We'll be back in a sec.

1125
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,170
Thanks, babe.

1126
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:29,450
20 minutes later, Rick hadn't returned.

1127
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:34,510
So Barbara went to look for him right on cue.

1128
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,850
She reached for the music box.

1129
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,310
Yeah?

1130
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:43,950
Oh, I reach him.

1131
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:51,890
And as she wound the key, she listened for Rick, but the
house was silent.

1132
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,030
Oh, it's for the basement.

1133
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,050
This is scary.

1134
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:58,810
Oh my god, I'm in the book.

1135
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:00,710
Not the music.

1136
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:11,540
She found Rick's crutch and imagined the worst.

1137
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:23,860
Hey, yeah.

1138
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:24,600
Oh.

1139
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:06,590
That's scary.

1140
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,690
Not the hook man!

1141
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:13,690
Car hook!

1142
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,910
Wait, what about the ganged...

1143
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:17,810
masked hooligans?

1144
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:26,390
Wait, if I go down there, is there still gonna be blood?

1145
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,810
Oh, this is the worst thing I've ever seen though.

1146
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,000
My stream is already gonna get DMCA'd, so why not?

1147
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,140
Keep it up for as long!

1148
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:48,680
as i want

1149
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:06,540
the stream is cooked i won't let them get me

1150
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:12,300
I smack first.

1151
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,040
Oh, it's letting...

1152
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,480
Run!

1153
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:15,300
Oh dear!

1154
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,160
Oh!

1155
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:19,740
Rick?

1156
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,620
Barb, relax.

1157
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:26,180
I was just trying to scare you to help you find your scream.

1158
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:26,700
Oh dear.

1159
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,440
I'm not scared, Rick.

1160
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:29,820
I'm furious.

1161
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,140
Then act furious.

1162
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,920
All I'm getting from you now is that you're hurt and
confused and you...

1163
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,120
Is this guy like a...

1164
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,120
She threw him out.

1165
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,380
But she kept a little something to remember him by.

1166
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,040
His crutch?

1167
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:44,320
Barb!

1168
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,240
Have you seen my other crutch?

1169
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,700
And she was still holding it.

1170
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:53,120
And she fell asleep watching the late, late picture show.

1171
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:56,260
Hours later...

1172
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:56,780
Barbara!

1173
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:57,820
Huh?

1174
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:58,340
Walter?

1175
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,460
What's going on up there?

1176
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,080
Ah!

1177
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:02,020
Huh?

1178
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,420
Okay, I'm coming up.

1179
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,080
But this is a trick for dead Walter.

1180
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,220
Oh no.

1181
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:10,880
Ha!

1182
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,960
Look at the skelly over there.

1183
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,140
It's not the music again.

1184
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:26,360
They're gonna be like, there was a crime, there was a scene.

1185
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,140
She was fighting for her life.

1186
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,500
Can they even use this song?

1187
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,460
Is it allowed?

1188
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,340
I'm not letting them.

1189
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,540
The scary guy on this side.

1190
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,780
Okay, he's not.

1191
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,440
Not there yet.

1192
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:17,860
Is it yours?

1193
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,600
Is it...

1194
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:18,960
Oh, what?

1195
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:19,600
Who's...

1196
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,040
Oh, okay.

1197
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:20,960
We gotta go this way.

1198
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,660
Why is there two skeletons?

1199
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:27,600
They're both like facing the same direction too.

1200
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:32,680
Walter!

1201
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,560
I'm here to save you!

1202
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,240
Walter, are you there?

1203
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:41,900
Vanished.

1204
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,500
At his bedside radio, I still am.

1205
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:52,140
Orca's Island police described the man is six feet tall with
a steel hook for a hand residents are urged to lock all

1206
01:19:52,140 --> 01:20:00,500
doors and windows and notify the police of any suspicious
activity oh my god oh my god Barbara turned saw the hook man

1207
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:18,780
and was speechless he was quite smashing yeah get his ass
and he couldn't get enough of Barbara Okay, Barbara, there's

1208
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,070
gotta be another way out of here.

1209
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:32,950
But she played her part beautifully.

1210
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:34,090
What?

1211
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:41,130
It's funny because the bottom, kind of like, the little
panel kind of, uh, spoiled it.

1212
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:43,910
Um, do I go in here?

1213
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:47,110
Do I go out and confront him?

1214
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,760
Years, the hinges grow.

1215
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,440
Oh, no!

1216
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,140
Oh, no!

1217
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:58,940
Oh.

1218
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,740
Here I go!

1219
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:15,100
He wasn't moving, but she sensed this story might not be
over yet.

1220
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:15,420
Here I go.

1221
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,720
I'm gonna go get his butt.

1222
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,680
No surprises!

1223
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,460
No surprises!

1224
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,180
No surprises!

1225
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:28,380
No surprises!

1226
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:29,420
No surprises!

1227
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:29,940
No surprises!

1228
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,240
No surprises!

1229
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,060
No surprises!

1230
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:38,940
She

1231
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:53,780
listened for his breathing, but all she heard was...

1232
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,920
No surprises!

1233
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,380
Maybe he's in here.

1234
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,720
Dying to speak to young Barbara.

1235
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,660
At the door, she heard whispering.

1236
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:17,900
Whisperings?

1237
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,520
It was coming from inside the house.

1238
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,080
What is going on?

1239
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,260
No, please.

1240
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,340
Oh, dear.

1241
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,860
Oh, dear.

1242
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:33,660
Surprise!

1243
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,940
The monsters, I come to surprise her.

1244
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:42,760
Wait, what?

1245
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,200
Barbara, it was a dream come true.

1246
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:53,620
She saw what kind of monsters they were, and she realized
what was about to happen.

1247
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:07,240
She was going to be famous, and with her final breath,
Barbara Finch gave the performance of her life.

1248
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,480
She looked so happy about it.

1249
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,700
I didn't care myself, but I hear Barbara.

1250
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:31,260
was magnificent she found her scream she had a taste for
stardom but unfortunately so did her fans of course the

1251
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:42,040
police blamed it all on poor rick who disappeared the same
night whoa and little walter hiding under his bed the whole

1252
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:48,040
time oh that little punk he took it all pretty hard but
That's another story.

1253
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:54,600
As for Barbara, tucked inside the music box is all they ever
found of her.

1254
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,080
What?

1255
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,840
Her ear.

1256
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:03,860
Now that's what I call a real eerie tale.

1257
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:07,420
Oh my

1258
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:13,350
god!

1259
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,970
At least put it back upright.

1260
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,830
Edie told me all Barbara wanted was to be remembered.

1261
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,990
as absurd as that comic was.

1262
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,170
Maybe what Edie saw was a happy ending.

1263
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:29,610
Freaky.

1264
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,470
This one makes absolutely no sense to me.

1265
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:34,770
I can see no rational way why Barbara could have died.

1266
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:35,950
That doesn't seem absurd.

1267
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:37,110
Right?

1268
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:39,150
There's too many elements that I feel.

1269
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:42,610
Like, there's no...

1270
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:49,610
Because the narrator is so unreliable, you can't really
pinpoint, like, is the radio...

1271
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:51,830
The radio talks about gangs en masse.

1272
01:24:51,850 --> 01:25:02,450
But then also talks about a hook man and then she has her
boyfriend there and then there's like so much going on But

1273
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:12,250
also I feel so bad for her like Anyone who would think that
a child A child star sounds the exact same when they're an

1274
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:16,990
adult What do you mean the child can't scream like a child
anymore when she's 16?

1275
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:24,550
That's so stupid She's not a good actress anymore People are
so weird about that kind of stuff sometimes.

1276
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:28,530
John Carpenter apparently agreed for the music to be in the
game.

1277
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:29,030
Really?

1278
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,350
Wait, that's kind of awesome then.

1279
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:35,290
I guess now I know why mom doesn't like me playing with the
music box.

1280
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:36,210
Yeah?

1281
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,900
At the end, when she was all happy, she was thinking, what a
thrill or thrill or not.

1282
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,220
It's kind of how it is with voice acting, too.

1283
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:52,360
Yeah, yeah.

1284
01:25:55,180 --> 01:26:06,780
my my um my mom got scouted when she was a kid uh she used
to be a child actress they were like oh my gosh you have the

1285
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:16,880
it thing but my grandma she worked in hollywood she was a
hollywood makeup person and she knew like she kind of saw

1286
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:26,160
what the children child stars went through and like like the
adult even the adult actors and actresses what they went

1287
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:30,520
through and so she was like nah i'm not letting you go
through that life

1288
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:41,060
yeah is it getting darker you know i even turned up the
brightness in this game it was just by one but i'm kind of

1289
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:44,600
glad i did good call i know right

1290
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:55,040
hello oh i'm stuck i'm the slowest ever holy out time to go
into the basement

1291
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:11,880
keep going can you speed run this game if you already know
this part don't

1292
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:30,220
think so oh okay oh probably only lets you turn it so many
times right oh my gosh it's just like everything we saw in

1293
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:41,640
the comic i miss my crutch i miss my crutch i miss my crutch
of safety.

1294
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,420
At least those creepy things.

1295
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,080
There's just a couple gnomes.

1296
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:47,640
That's it.

1297
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:51,780
Some wood.

1298
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,720
Mom said the basement was off limits.

1299
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,460
Unless I wanted another tetanus shot.

1300
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:58,040
I feel so defenseless without it.

1301
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:58,540
I know.

1302
01:27:58,940 --> 01:27:59,260
I know.

1303
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,580
Realistically, couldn't you just smash the glass pin?

1304
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,980
I think we're trying to avoid vandalism, right?

1305
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,200
Oh my god, he built a mini dragon, too.

1306
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,060
He built a big dragon.

1307
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:12,480
A mini dragon.

1308
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,440
dragon to then build the big dragon.

1309
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:18,060
I saw Edie sneak down to the basement once carrying
packages.

1310
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:22,700
It's so dark.

1311
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:23,920
Can you guys see?

1312
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,280
I thought maybe she was hiding presents.

1313
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:30,580
I knew exactly where my mom would hide presents.

1314
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:33,660
Every year.

1315
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,640
She turned to the same place.

1316
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,220
Pretty well, actually.

1317
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:38,960
Oh, awesome.

1318
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,820
As long as you guys can see.

1319
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:59,760
it turned out she was hiding a lot more than that oh it's
like a holy cow it's like a a bunker did you always sneak a

1320
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:07,860
peek or did you manage to resist oh I snuck a peek so in my
right ear I remember asking mom once about where Walter had

1321
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:14,940
gone you think he went down here she said after Barbara died
he got his far away as he could.

1322
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:18,600
Oh, it is.

1323
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,240
Like a...

1324
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,280
Alvino!

1325
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,200
Extra crispy!

1326
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:25,660
You think the...

1327
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:26,340
Pea soup?

1328
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:27,420
Oh, I would die.

1329
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:28,720
I'm already dead.

1330
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:29,960
Just kill me again.

1331
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:31,120
I think there's a pattern in all these stories.

1332
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,440
Grape jelly.

1333
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,800
You think all these are still good?

1334
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:36,740
Peanut butter?

1335
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,040
Tomato ketchup as opposed to...

1336
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:55,250
tasty beans sweetie crisps I think it's that none of us has
gotten very far

1337
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:09,170
it's pretty eerie down here Walter

1338
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,920
just looking around

1339
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,020
aww oh

1340
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:41,180
that's cool I guess it's oh I guess it's nice too though
wait I don't want to do that yeah we'll go to him first

1341
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:52,460
March 2005 yeah it's a painting goodbye everyone I can't
believe I've been down here for 30 years

1342
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:00,660
on that first day after the shaking started I didn't think I
survived

1343
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:09,440
I was never interested in looking, but found out later that
my mom would wrap some presents in foil like leftovers and

1344
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,440
hide them in the freezer?

1345
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,040
That's genius!

1346
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,380
Which way do I?

1347
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:19,600
Oh, there we go.

1348
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,360
But after a few days, I settled into a routine.

1349
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:28,780
Oh my god.

1350
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,220
This one I have to do with my mouse.

1351
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,360
It won't let me do with the arrow keys.

1352
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,960
That's what kept me sane.

1353
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:49,290
Having a schedule.

1354
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:50,790
Living for today.

1355
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,810
What are these, Peaches?

1356
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,670
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

1357
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,770
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

1358
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,650
I love you.

1359
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:04,170
No, you can just do anything.

1360
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:07,550
No, our little ship.

1361
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:12,490
No, please, God, don't make me do it again.

1362
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:23,340
even a monster oh if i just like twirl my mouse around it's
way faster almost friendly

1363
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:45,320
he's just gobbling him whole everything just yeah we figured
out the tech oh whatever that thing was it was gone maybe

1364
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:53,160
you got tired of waiting what was the thing or maybe i just
got tired of being afraid is it does it coincide when

1365
01:32:53,160 --> 01:33:05,380
somebody died the date there's so many dates and names you
remember it's been a week now the longest in 30 years i'm

1366
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:16,980
done waiting yeah i have to leave well i still can why don't
you Because he blocked it.

1367
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:17,840
Good job, Walter.

1368
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,880
He got them jiggly farms up in the bed.

1369
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,480
When you're in a pinch, it's midnight.

1370
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,420
You need a jiggly farm's midnight snack.

1371
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:30,800
I get it, buddy.

1372
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:31,600
We've all been there.

1373
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,780
Sorry to tell you, dude, but weeks have always been seven
days.

1374
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,640
More cereal.

1375
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,200
He's got his gunpla.

1376
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,760
Cereal gunpla.

1377
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,380
Cracking the curse?

1378
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,160
I need that.

1379
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,360
Exorcism.

1380
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,340
Warding away spirits.

1381
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:06,920
Wait a second.

1382
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,580
The Finch curse.

1383
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:10,320
Evil unleashed.

1384
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,120
Echoes from afar.

1385
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:12,980
Wait a second.

1386
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:13,880
Wait a second.

1387
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,520
I know it's out there somewhere.

1388
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,200
My man loves his alvinos.

1389
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,480
Whatever killed Barbara.

1390
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,240
And Molly.

1391
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:34,780
And Calvin.

1392
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,040
This is just gonna break it apart?

1393
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:41,940
What is this?

1394
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,360
Don't tell me that's a toilet.

1395
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:44,400
Oh, it's the garbage.

1396
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,660
It could be both.

1397
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,220
No, he had a toilet.

1398
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:50,960
He had a toilet.

1399
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:57,700
Do you think if he goes to the bathroom, it messes with
the...

1400
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,540
Maybe this is all a mistake.

1401
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,340
The water pressure of the main house.

1402
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:02,860
Okay.

1403
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:18,700
but I need to stop living the same day even if it kills me
for 30 years living the same day whatever's out there I want

1404
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:26,000
you to know I'm ready for it I feel his voice does not match
how he looked I'm going to appreciate all of it especially

1405
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:33,720
the food especially the food maybe he is a young guy but
it's just hard to tell because he had a big old beard.

1406
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,220
I don't mind if I only have a year left.

1407
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,340
Wait, why do you think that?

1408
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,060
Or a month.

1409
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:38,840
Oh.

1410
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,100
Or a single week.

1411
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:42,480
Or a day.

1412
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,420
Or a second.

1413
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,500
I'd be happy with one new day.

1414
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:46,500
No.

1415
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,400
I can already imagine the sun on my face.

1416
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:50,760
Oh!

1417
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,680
Oh, he thinks he's doomed because of the family curse.

1418
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,800
Yeah, that makes sense.

1419
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,740
Walter died when I was six.

1420
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:09,960
I can't believe my mom never told me he was down here

1421
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:24,000
That guy We don't talk about Walter being in the In the
walls Could we turn off the radio?

1422
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,800
I'm sure my mom was trying to protect me

1423
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:40,490
Oh, oops, my bad I accidentally clicked out of it One new
day Oh Walta, put your cans away, Walta.

1424
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:42,810
I'm not eating peaches with you today, Walta.

1425
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,780
He literally...

1426
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:50,880
He literally went outside once.

1427
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,200
Maybe she was afraid I'd end up like Walta.

1428
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,000
Went outside once and died.

1429
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:59,240
But if she never told me about an uncle under the house...

1430
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,060
What else?

1431
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,540
I can only imagine what else she was hiding.

1432
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,300
Yeah, exactly.

1433
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,720
I don't want to make the same mistakes she made.

1434
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,940
I love when sometimes I'm looking...

1435
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,660
at something and the game's like, no, no.

1436
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:19,540
It feels like it feels like it's physically grabbing my head
and like pulling it into another direction.

1437
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,780
I want to look at the garbage.

1438
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:25,440
Fine.

1439
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,800
Trying to bury something that's still alive.

1440
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,960
Sorry, I know this game is serious.

1441
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:36,020
I'm just trying to lighten it a little bit so it's not so
heavy for all of us, you know?

1442
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,160
Or maybe two.

1443
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,200
Two?

1444
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,300
Only Walter, I'd be tubers.

1445
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,120
I thought it was time I heard the stories for myself.

1446
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:50,260
And found out what happened to everyone else.

1447
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,300
But now I'm worried the stories themselves might be the
problem.

1448
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,480
Maybe we believed so much in a family curse.

1449
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:02,140
Yeah.

1450
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:03,740
We made it real.

1451
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:05,520
Right.

1452
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,040
What's that over there?

1453
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:10,760
Cool.

1454
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:15,040
Wait, so how long has this leg been here then?

1455
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,720
If the guy died by train.

1456
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:20,960
Unless it was like a...

1457
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,980
You know, maybe he died somewhere else.

1458
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:25,820
But...

1459
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,840
But there is a train track here.

1460
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,800
Train was a metaphor.

1461
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:31,800
Yeah, I guess so.

1462
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:35,480
Cute.

1463
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:40,330
Look, right?

1464
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:44,710
Ah, I see it, I see it.

1465
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,230
What's that red light?

1466
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:56,190
I thought we were out like truly in the middle of nowhere,
but there's just...

1467
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:57,210
There's stuff over there.

1468
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:59,210
And there's chairs in the trees?

1469
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:01,770
Totally.

1470
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:04,250
Normal behavior.

1471
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:08,970
I don't know if I should even be writing this.

1472
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:28,440
maybe it'd be better if all this just died with me no oh
that's freaking I guess it's solar powered so it still works

1473
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:33,300
but I thought you should know about your family are we
pregnant

1474
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:43,620
and the history you're a part of look down

1475
01:39:48,480 --> 01:40:03,000
wait she has like a ring on so she was married or maybe
that's a family ring she hinted at something earlier too and

1476
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,720
I was thinking oh maybe we're pregnant

1477
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:14,220
regante but to be honest I feel as lost as you probably do
right now

1478
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:28,180
I think the people in these stories believed them for what
that worth yeah I think so too I think they very much

1479
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:37,900
believe them I want to go to the island with the red light
what's

1480
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:56,240
out there it calls me no one knows well you can see the
other side it's

1481
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,800
awesome to see you playing my favorite game yeah I'm really
enjoying it so far.

1482
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:10,260
It kind of feels...

1483
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,480
It kind of feels like watching a movie.

1484
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,460
Have that history of imagination and stubbornness and
madness.

1485
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,420
It's like walking the simulator.

1486
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:21,460
Any of it seems possible.

1487
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,700
It's kind of nice sometimes.

1488
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:25,960
I don't have to do anything.

1489
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:31,560
I just have to click sometimes and walk forward.

1490
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,460
It's pretty nice.

1491
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,500
Trash.

1492
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:41,040
surrounded by death for so long, we've just gotten used to
it.

1493
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,740
What's that?

1494
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:44,860
Oh, a lamp.

1495
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:48,780
What kind of family finishes building a cemetery before
starting the house?

1496
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,760
Yeah, that's kind of crazy.

1497
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,160
Oh my gosh, there it is.

1498
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,240
It's embarrassing for me to admit this, but...

1499
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:58,840
What?

1500
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:03,600
The pet cemetery may be more uncomfortable than the human
one.

1501
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:05,520
Oh, no, there's...

1502
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,420
Three of the gerbils are mine, and...

1503
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,740
Two had been my fault.

1504
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:11,440
No, gerbils are just like that.

1505
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,520
They really are.

1506
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,900
They're just like that.

1507
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,280
There they are.

1508
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,940
Zerpy, lurpy, furpy, chirpy, burpy.

1509
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:24,860
Derpy and Derpy Jr. Oh.

1510
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,120
Oh.

1511
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:31,100
A frog.

1512
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,100
We don't know his name.

1513
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:36,440
Oh.

1514
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,780
She had a dog named Shadow.

1515
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:41,380
Aww.

1516
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,780
Sven built the house, but it was Edie who designed the
cemetery.

1517
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:49,740
Oh my gosh.

1518
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,160
There's just a little hole.

1519
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,620
Wait, that's so cute!

1520
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:01,060
Oh my gosh, that's so stinking cute.

1521
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:11,020
Shadow the dog, she was a black lab.

1522
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:19,110
I've never heard of a gerbil that didn't die in a metal way.

1523
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:19,810
Right!

1524
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:25,010
But it's also kind of awesome when you find gerbils that are
really old.

1525
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:26,170
They're kind of fun.

1526
01:43:27,890 --> 01:43:28,950
Edie Finch.

1527
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:31,190
Sven Finch.

1528
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,830
Calvin Finch.

1529
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:35,850
Molly Finch.

1530
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:38,170
Oh, she's like her little cat.

1531
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:40,690
Hmm.

1532
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:45,270
I'm sure Odin's monument has been.

1533
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:46,370
I'd been Edie's idea.

1534
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:49,290
My mom was always trying to move on.

1535
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:51,710
But for Edie, the past never went away.

1536
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:57,650
I was going to say, what about, like, Edie's mom and dad and
everything, too?

1537
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:02,090
He's like my home!

1538
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:06,510
She could see it poking out of the water at low tide.

1539
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:09,270
That's the home!

1540
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:11,170
No stinking way.

1541
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:13,070
That's what it is.

1542
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,860
Edie said she dreamed about the old house every night

1543
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:24,740
That's awesome

1544
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,840
Where do I go from here though?

1545
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:52,500
Uh, hold on, let me look around a bit more maybe Nope I have
one chance Further down?

1546
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,980
Is there a way to- I don't think there is a further down

1547
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:03,040
I was thinking I may be looking at that but up

1548
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:20,770
then right oh here okay okay wait yes yes we didn't go this
way but the older I get the more I can see where my mom was

1549
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:22,210
coming from

1550
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:33,250
gory her dad had been pretty strict but it wasn't enough to
save her brothers she was just trying to do better oh my

1551
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:40,400
gosh Okay, hold on.

1552
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,760
I'm going to look at it.

1553
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,360
So, it starts with Odin.

1554
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:53,580
Sven and Edie are Odin's...

1555
01:45:55,080 --> 01:46:00,060
Uh, well, Edie is Odin's, uh...

1556
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:00,820
What's the word?

1557
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:03,060
Daughter.

1558
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:04,840
They...

1559
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,120
This is such a bizarre family tree.

1560
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,100
The way they drew it does not make sense.

1561
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,200
Yeah, daughter.

1562
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:12,060
son-in-law.

1563
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:12,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1564
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:19,440
They have Sam, Calvin, Barbara, Molly.

1565
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:20,720
Walter?

1566
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:23,880
Where does Kay come from?

1567
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:24,420
Wait, no.

1568
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:24,920
Sam.

1569
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,040
Sam stays alive.

1570
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,760
I guess he is with Kay.

1571
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:34,940
Kay and Sam have Gus Gregory Dawn.

1572
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:41,500
Dawn goes with Sanjay.

1573
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:44,540
And they have Lewis, Milton, Edith.

1574
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,520
Yeah, everything in blue is like the Finch family proper.

1575
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:59,960
And then the little, like in black leaves are the people
that marry in, it seems.

1576
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,140
Think you got it?

1577
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:01,720
Okay, okay.

1578
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:03,820
There's so many names.

1579
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,360
Holy cow.

1580
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,580
Okay, hold on.

1581
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:09,020
So Sam is, okay.

1582
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,260
He's one of their, he's one of their sons.

1583
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:14,500
Okay.

1584
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:24,100
And so, Gus and Gregory are the two that are Dawn's
brothers.

1585
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:25,200

1598
01:48:55,410 --> 01:49:02,130
If she told me there was going to be so much climbing, I
never would have come when I was 22 weeks pregnant.

1599
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:04,030
You're pregnant!

1600
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,210

Uh, maybe don't go on the glass?

1604
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,240
I never met Grandpa Sam, but I think he and my mom had a lot
in common.

1605
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:48,400
works in this place they were both pretty intense where oh
is this Sam's room oh yeah it must be because he yeah all

1606
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:55,460
the photography Sam spent his life shooting photos but mom
said he got nervous being in front of the camera and also

1607
01:49:55,460 --> 01:50:03,100
shooting animals and people baby shooting everything this
guy can't Stop shooting!

1608
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:04,940
Dang!

1609
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,220
It's like five to six months pregnant, right?

1610
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:09,960
Oh my gosh.

1611
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:13,500
I don't understand why they talk in months.

1612
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,380
Why are they like, yeah, my baby is 300 months old.

1613
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,720
I don't know what that is.

1614
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:28,720
Once it gets to a year old, why can't we just say a year and
five months?

1615
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:37,880
That ain't a baby.

1616
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:50,490
300 months is 25 years old.

1617
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:59,650
Quinto is 228 months old forever.

1618
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:03,810
I don't even reach 300 months.

1619
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,590
I just set a number.

1620
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:10,230
And you know what?

1621
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:14,950
I said that and in my brain, I was like, what is that?

1622
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:15,790
Three?

1623
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,900
I'm crying.

1624
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:34,540
Man.

1625
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:40,220
Did you mean weeks?

1626
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:41,160
No.

1627
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,200
Okay.

1628
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,580
Look at that guy.

1629
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,640
My name's Sam.

1630
01:51:56,060 --> 01:51:56,400
Whoa.

1631
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:57,880
Whoa.

1632
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,700
Oh my god.

1633
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:03,000
What else is in here?

1634
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:07,160
Instead of hiding from death, Sam seemed to go out of his
way to meet it.

1635
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,540
He got a little feet on his wall.

1636
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,860
Not the cat.

1637
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:17,920
Okay, that I'm not okay with.

1638
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:23,400
I mean, I don't like taxidermy in general, but, you know.

1639
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:26,480
Not the cat.

1640
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:34,260
But I kind of want to get my cat taxidermied.

1641
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,140
I want to pet him all the time.

1642
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,140
He's so soft.

1643
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:51,820
It's like the most...

1644
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:55,100
Oh, that's a Facebook profile picture if I've ever...

1645
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:56,040
What the hell?

1646
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:58,320
If I've ever seen one.

1647
01:52:58,620 --> 01:53:00,000
Dawn, I promise.

1648
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,660

Yes, sir.

1650
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:04,960
These memories are going to last a lifetime.

1651
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:05,380
Perfect.

1652
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:06,100
Oh.

1653
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,680
It's going to rain the whole weekend, isn't it?

1654
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,980

1655
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,540

01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,340
The camera's older than you are.

1661
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,140
Does he want the bird?

1662
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,100

02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:08,440
You have 20 calendar days after this summons is served on
you to file a written response.

1757
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,820
Dear Kay, do you remember the way Gregory used to laugh when
he thought he was alone?

1758
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:21,020
Like, something funny was happening, but only he could see
it.

1759
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,860
We're going to witness the baby death?

1760
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,720
The ducky is staring at me.

1761
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:01,960
It isn't graphic or anything.

1762
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:07,160
They haven't been so far, so I wasn't going to imagine that
this one would be too...

1763
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:09,320
Imagine if they're just like, okay, here comes the baby.

1764
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:20,920
I already I already know what's going to happen because of
where we are at I fear

1765
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,060
Oh I don't want to do it

1766
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:58,480
What if the ducky is Medusa and we are reduced we are turned
to stone And that's why we're not moving It's my fault I

1767
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,740
know why but you know

1768
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:16,280
I guess we have to to get through it.

1769
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:17,540
Oh, I don't want to, though.

1770
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:17,840
Oh.

1771
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:29,370
I think he saw things the rest of us don't.

1772
02:03:30,730 --> 02:03:33,230
Oh, I don't like when kids look in the corner.

1773
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:34,930
They're staring at me, usually.

1774
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:36,270
I don't like that.

1775
02:03:37,690 --> 02:03:37,850
Oh!

1776
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:49,100
How high can he go?

1777
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:51,460
Oh, Gregory, it's time to...

1778
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:52,060
Uh-oh.

1779
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:53,800
Hold on, sweetie.

1780
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:56,440
No, no.

1781
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:57,460
Hello?

1782
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,340
Oh, mama, no, mama!

1783
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:04,000
Sam, I told you I don't want to talk right now.

1784
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,840
I wonder what he saw.

1785
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:14,300
What his world was like.

1786
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,860
Oh, look how cute they are.

1787
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:32,060
Where could them go?

1788
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:33,420
Lost in his imagination.

1789
02:04:43,660 --> 02:04:44,220
Oh,

1790
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:52,080
my God.

1791
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,480
All the friends come in.

1792
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:58,440
Whatever it was, he saw.

1793
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:09,120
This is so cute, though, at the same time.

1794
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,300
Whoa!

1795
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,280
Oh, I get away from the handle.

1796
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:20,180
.

1797
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:20,200
.

1798
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:20,240
.

1799
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:20,360
.

1800
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:20,440
.

1801
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:26,160
.

1802
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:35,860
The whale is watching.

1803
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:40,820
.

1804
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:45,730
This doesn't seem like a good idea.

1805
02:05:49,070 --> 02:05:49,930
Knock all those.

1806
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:51,010
Knock it all in.

1807
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:53,490
Oh my gosh, I'm so close.

1808
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:55,430
Get it.

1809
02:05:55,610 --> 02:05:56,070
Oh my god.

1810
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:57,010
I thought I had it.

1811
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:01,870
You said the toys would be fun in the bath before.

1812
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,910
I did say that, didn't I?

1813
02:06:04,570 --> 02:06:05,870
Oh my god, and they're here.

1814
02:06:07,190 --> 02:06:08,530
Maybe I am the baby.

1815
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:10,710
Kinto duties.

1816
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:13,850
Gregory's name into the bathtub.

1817
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:15,230
I got an achievement for it.

1818
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:17,950
Maybe I am the baby.

1819
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:20,330
Knock this off.

1820
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:25,410
Unplug the tub.

1821
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:38,470
I don't... Am I supposed to do this?

1822
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:38,750
Okay.

1823
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:41,530
Oh my god, it'd be so morbid if I turned on the water.

1824
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:42,910
Where am I supposed to go though?

1825
02:06:46,610 --> 02:06:51,610
Can I get to the whale?

1826
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:52,650
Oh, I'm on the whale.

1827
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:53,670
You're made of happy.

1828
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:54,910
Oh, my gosh.

1829
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:58,250
Whale!

1830
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:00,110
Whale!

1831
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:01,510
I'm flipping over.

1832
02:07:04,270 --> 02:07:04,650
Yeah!

1833
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:04,970
Oh.

1834
02:07:05,390 --> 02:07:05,810
Boing.

1835
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:07,650
Boing.

1836
02:07:08,650 --> 02:07:08,950
Oh!

1837
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:12,330
Okay.

1838
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:15,370
Oh, wait, one second.

1839
02:07:17,390 --> 02:07:17,590
What?

1840
02:07:21,770 --> 02:07:23,610
It's like platforming now?

1841
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:31,280
If they really wanted to break your heart, they should have
done like the padadu and it would have been so sad.

1842
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:32,340
Wait, hold on!

1843
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:33,720
Let me up there!

1844
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:35,960
They're like, oh, you can't get all the way up there, that's
fine.

1845
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:36,920
I'll give you the...

1846
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:40,440
I know how silly it sounds.

1847
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,560
I got it!

1848
02:07:50,610 --> 02:07:51,770
Nice and saucy!

1849
02:07:52,930 --> 02:08:09,060
and clean come on about gregory i know you did everything
you could maybe if i hadn't called that night hold

1850
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,030
on i don't want gregory to hear this

1851
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:33,260
oh no i wish she could have told us about the world itself
Oh my god.

1852
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:36,560
No, turn it off!

1853
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:37,460
Turn it off!

1854
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:41,100
There's so much I don't understand.

1855
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:46,960
About everything.

1856
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,940
Yeah, go get to the plug, get to the plug.

1857
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:56,860
Get to the plug!

1858
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:58,360
What

1859
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,220
happened wasn't your fault.

1860
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:11,340
Oh, I can go faster.

1861
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:12,440
I can go faster.

1862
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:17,680
Go, go, go, go.

1863
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,180
Oh, oh.

1864
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:19,080
I'm sure he's happy.

1865
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:20,480
No!

1866
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:24,960
And he'd want you to be happy too.

1867
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:27,700
Good luck, Kay.

1868
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:29,660
Love, Sam.

1869
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:25,560
I think even for, like, toddlers i think it's like 30
seconds in a pool what's even crazier is like there's there

1870
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:39,310
will be like like at parties and stuff you know everyone
will think that someone's watching the kids but it's usually

1871
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:50,430
like oh because some there's so many people they'll think
but there's it can happen so fast like it can i've i've

1872
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:53,030
heard so many stories it's like so crazy

1873
02:11:06,370 --> 02:11:15,690
babies can drown in two inches of water it's insane yeah
there's so many horror stories and like oh my gosh i i heard

1874
02:11:15,690 --> 02:11:26,770
one literally just the other day about like you know about
like uh it was like a family and they were in their kitchen

1875
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:34,390
and no one heard the kid just slip out from the chair and
walk out the door and then go into the lake which first of

1876
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:42,790
all what the heck kid what are you drawn to the lake for I'm
not trying to blame the kid obviously but it's just like oh

1877
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:52,810
my gosh that's the first thing you do you have freedom and
you go to the lake it's so sad kids are stealthy they really

1878
02:11:52,810 --> 02:12:01,110
are they really are he yearns so sad

1879
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:23,510
it's not you know something i can relate to but i mean i
can't imagine for a family just how devastating you know

1880
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:30,370
like how could you even like be around the other person ever
again

1881
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:44,940
adults can drown in two inches of water take drowning risks
seriously drowning is so scary be careful you guys hopefully

1882
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:46,040
not ever

1883
02:12:51,850 --> 02:13:01,810
explains the well it seems like the divorce was coming
before then because he was calling her you know And she was

1884
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:02,930
like, ah, don't call me.

1885
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:03,370
Oh, wait.

1886
02:13:04,330 --> 02:13:05,250
Where was she getting it?

1887
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:05,510
No.

1888
02:13:06,570 --> 02:13:07,850
She was like, stop calling me.

1889
02:13:08,150 --> 02:13:08,590
Or something.

1890
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:11,290
Yeah, it was already happening.

1891
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:22,960
They were separated and arguing on the phone.

1892
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:23,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1893
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,320
That's so sad.

1894
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,020
That's so sad.

1895
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:33,740
I guess, um...

1896
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:39,720
I guess that was probably the quote on...

1897
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:49,260
unquote easiest way they could have shown that scene
probably maybe that

1898
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:02,690
was the worst one in the game i'm glad we got it over with
uh

1899
02:14:10,820 --> 02:14:23,200
i mean i knew that the baby i just don't want to like i
don't want to go back and die i mean i knew that the baby

1900
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:43,780
past obviously but I don't want to like I didn't know what
to expect a later one feels worse to me really yes we'll see

1901
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:53,380
hmm at least it was quick it was pretty quick yeah and it
was very cute like all things considered it was very cute

1902
02:14:53,380 --> 02:14:59,280
and I was having fun, being a little froggy, bouncing
around, so.

1903
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,120
Look how funny the baby looks on the...

1904
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:04,980
Honestly, I thought that too.

1905
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:10,060
The portrait she drew makes him look demonic.

1906
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:13,240
I think Edith...

1907
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:15,640
I think...

1908
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:18,400
Hopefully Edith is not an artiste.

1909
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:21,340
In fact, I don't understand really why she's drawing
everybody.

1910
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:26,380
Like he looks so...

1911
02:15:26,380 --> 02:15:35,720
I didn't want to say anything when she drew him because it
was right after but my first thought was just Edith.

1912
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:39,240
Why are we sketching everybody?

1913
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:43,320
Oh my goodness gracious.

1914
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:46,780
At least it's not AI.

1915
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:49,960
Edith picks up the pencil.

1916
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:50,940
She'll get better.

1917
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:51,800
Maybe.

1918
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:53,500
She's just a hobbyist.

1919
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:56,240
Yeah, most of them look pretty good.

1920
02:15:56,960 --> 02:15:57,520
I'd say.

1921
02:15:57,620 --> 02:15:58,940
Like, Barbara's looks good.

1922
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:01,040
I'd say Walters looks good.

1923
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:02,020
Sam's looks good.

1924
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:03,320
Calvin is, like, whatever.

1925
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:05,180
Odin's is okay.

1926
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:06,500
Molly's is okay.

1927
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:08,220
But Gregory.

1928
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:13,360
Gregory got done so dirty.

1929
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:18,080
She even drew herself so cute.

1930
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:21,200
Oh.

1931
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:25,600
Gregory.

1932
02:16:26,340 --> 02:16:26,640
All right.

1933
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:29,200
Well, we have another one to get into also.

1934
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:30,900
So let's check this one out too.

1935
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:34,960
Gus with his cool mohawk.

1936
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:36,480
And his...

1937
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:37,460
Oh my god, he's a punk.

1938
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:39,280
He's an actual...

1939
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,620
He's an actual punk.

1940
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:43,260
Oh, this is long.

1941
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:44,120
A poem for Gus.

1942
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:46,900
Who always said the wedding was a bad idea.

1943
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,540
Our father never hit us kids.

1944
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,040
At least not very hard.

1945
02:16:51,420 --> 02:17:02,810
Before the day my brother said regard that he'd be dead
before he'd see a wedding in our yard oh not yet

1946
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:11,780
we oh my god i'm just disrupting the wedding crash into the
wedding party

1947
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:26,240
where's the next part

1948
02:17:31,140 --> 02:17:34,000
This is why they yearn for childless weddings.

1949
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:37,100
You're just gonna have some kid that's like...

1950
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:39,820
How do I get this part?

1951
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:42,460
Oh, do I have to flip it around?

1952
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,160
Oh, I have to flip it around myself.

1953
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:45,740
Okay.

1954
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:51,840
My father made him come, of course, but Gus stood far apart.

1955
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:55,500
Just flew his kite and bottled up the storm inside his
heart.

1956
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,320
I can't collect these ones though.

1957
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:04,120
Ah, so close.

1958
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:11,000
I tried to talk him out of it, but though he'd never met
her, we don't need a stepmom, we're the words that I...

1959
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,720
I now pronounce you, husband and wife.

1960
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:14,720
Ah, boo!

1961
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:25,680
He's an emo little kid.

1962
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:30,440
When the time for photos came, Dad ordered him to come here.

1963
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:30,880
Oh.

1964
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:36,840
But Gus declined, and as a sign held up his middle finger,
Ah, yeah!

1965
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:40,980
I don't want to be part of your photos!

1966
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:45,160
This one's fun too.

1967
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:49,540
I feel such childhood whimsy with all of these.

1968
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:50,980
He disappeared and quickly went.

1969
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:54,280
But all the humans did that day was go inside the tent.

1970
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:58,060
Oh, they're gone.

1971
02:18:59,360 --> 02:18:59,780
Uh-oh.

1972
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:01,880
It's not thunder, is it?

1973
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:06,260
Meow!

1974
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:12,970
Oh my god.

1975
02:19:13,190 --> 02:19:13,790
Oh my god.

1976
02:19:15,370 --> 02:19:15,930
Katamari.

1977
02:19:16,790 --> 02:19:20,030
Rain came down in buckets then, but no one seemed afraid.

1978
02:19:20,250 --> 02:19:23,230
That nature might destroy the tent our dad had crudely made.

1979
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:27,410
Oh, there's more.

1980
02:19:29,010 --> 02:19:29,630
Oh my god.

1981
02:19:29,990 --> 02:19:30,570
Oh my god.

1982
02:19:31,330 --> 02:19:34,790
The thunder sounded much too close and full of angry power.

1983
02:19:35,570 --> 02:19:38,590
But all my father said to this was, Make the music louder.

1984
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:41,530
Yeah, Benjamin Franklin time.

1985
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,590
He's gonna get struck.

1986
02:19:43,830 --> 02:19:44,690
Oh, gosh.

1987
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:45,570
Oh, my God.

1988
02:19:47,770 --> 02:19:47,950
Oh!

1989
02:19:50,870 --> 02:19:52,310
Yeah, duck down, duck down.

1990
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:57,230
I wish that I could truly say I thought about you on that
day.

1991
02:19:58,290 --> 02:19:59,370
Out there on the beach alone.

1992
02:20:00,050 --> 02:20:02,250
Just you, the wind, the sea, and foam.

1993
02:20:03,250 --> 02:20:03,430
Oh!

1994
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:04,930
But I didn't.

1995
02:20:06,090 --> 02:20:07,150
Until we found you.

1996
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:12,640
It's kind of...

1997
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:16,260
That's so, so morbid.

1998
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:23,040
She never talked about him, but mom told me once if I was a
boy, they were going to name me Gus.

1999
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:29,580
She was like, yeah, I didn't get, I don't care about you at
all.

2000
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:32,780
Didn't think one thought about you the whole day.

2001
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:33,980
Wow, okay.

2002
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:36,780
You climbing up?

2003
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:40,520
My mom moved up to the loft after her brothers died.

2004
02:20:42,460 --> 02:20:43,720
That's so sad.

2005
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:47,120
At the time, it was as far away as she could get.

2006
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:53,300
Now you know where those tree chairs were from.

2007
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:55,880
No kidding, you're right!

2008
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:57,900
Oh my gosh.

2009
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,080
Religion was another thing my mom never talked about.

2010
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:04,640
But I think it helped her a lot after her dad died.

2011
02:21:10,480 --> 02:21:11,840
She's in India, boo.

2012
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:14,620
She spent a summer building.

2013
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:18,580
My mom moved to India a week after graduation and got a job
teaching English.

2014
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my bad.

2015
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:22,420
What'd she say?

2016
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:29,600
Fly to India!

2017
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:34,340
I guess she became an English teacher over there.

2018
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,080
Is that what it seemed like?

2019
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:41,160
I, it, I, it, it, it, it, it happened on its own.

2020
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:47,320
I didn't click anything.

2021
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:48,300
I went to here.

2022
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,600
I was just going to open it and then it happened.

2023
02:21:51,540 --> 02:21:51,880
Hmm.

2024
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:56,040
And she met Sanjay.

2025
02:21:58,560 --> 02:21:59,400
I'm trying to see.

2026
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:01,460
She's even got a phone up in here and everything.

2027
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:04,260
High school.

2028
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:05,660
Dawn Finch.

2029
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:07,060
Wow.

2030
02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:08,200
Don't forget.

2031
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,800
Visa application.

2032
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:11,380
Background check.

2033
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:12,780
Inter.

2034
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:13,660
Some.

2035
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:14,320
Inter.

2036
02:22:16,220 --> 02:22:17,500
She's thinking for two.

2037
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:18,480
Happens sometimes.

2038
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,520
They're so detailed in this game.

2039
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:29,960
with like every single little thing has something oh wait
that's not what i meant to do i have to climb back up sorry

right can you imagine marrying into this family not knowing

2041
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:49,240
the history seriously though

2042
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:07,100
Lewis was born a year later Oh my god There's still Missing
posters up here

2043
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:22,000
I don't trust this at all Oh my gosh This place is so Like
Hastily When my dad died I don't think mom knew where else

2044
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:31,080
to go I'm sure Edie was happy to have her back Oh my gosh Oh
my gosh And to see kids in the house again.

2045
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:35,640
And then they all die!

2046
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:36,120
Oh!

2047
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:44,330
Mom!

2048
02:23:45,530 --> 02:23:46,090
Mom!

2049
02:23:46,930 --> 02:23:48,190
I'm in the game!

2050
02:23:49,970 --> 02:23:51,350
I'm in the game!

2051
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:57,020
Oh my god!

2052
02:23:57,940 --> 02:23:59,980
It's like it's my grave!

2053
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:01,200
Wow!

2054
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:05,480
I'm in the game!

2055
02:24:15,170 --> 02:24:18,950
The house had to get a little bigger, but Edie was used to
that.

2056
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:21,050
Just keep building up, baby.

2057
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:24,670
God, it really does feel like the Winchester mansion.

2058
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:30,590
And for a while, things were good.

2059
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:32,030
Almost normal.

2060
02:24:33,090 --> 02:24:33,470
Whoa.

2061
02:24:34,630 --> 02:24:35,770
Our family history.

2062
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:36,890
Fact or fiction?

2063
02:24:37,910 --> 02:24:38,430
Flip one.

2064
02:24:40,010 --> 02:24:42,890
You could say anything, and I would believe it, about this
family.

2065
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:43,790
Wait a second.

2066
02:24:43,790 --> 02:24:45,170
You died?

2067
02:24:47,430 --> 02:24:48,970
I need this.

2068
02:24:49,610 --> 02:24:50,590
Wait, I need this.

2069
02:24:50,790 --> 02:24:52,090
Multiplication tape.

2070
02:24:55,050 --> 02:24:56,950
Yeah, the fire code.

2071
02:24:59,130 --> 02:24:59,810
Oh, sorry.

2072
02:25:00,130 --> 02:25:01,710
Fire code in this place goes crazy.

2073
02:25:04,010 --> 02:25:06,450
I could not learn with that buzzing sound.

2074
02:25:09,370 --> 02:25:10,390
Put it in last.

2075
02:25:13,130 --> 02:25:13,670
Odin.

2076
02:25:13,790 --> 02:25:14,830
The curse!

2077
02:25:15,870 --> 02:25:17,050
Oh my gosh.

2078
02:25:17,690 --> 02:25:20,270
Hello kids, let me teach you about the curse of our family.

2079
02:25:21,410 --> 02:25:24,410
The beginning of the end was Milton's 10th birthday.

2080
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:26,550
When Edie gave him a castle.

2081
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:31,800
Oh, it's sealed.

2082
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:40,720
After Milton disappeared, the only thing he left behind was
a room full of paintings.

2083
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:54,780
Wait, is there anything over here?

2084
02:25:58,570 --> 02:26:00,210
It's so pretty here, though.

2085
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:03,730
He's an artiste.

2086
02:26:13,310 --> 02:26:15,750
Does this turn into a door?

2087
02:26:16,130 --> 02:26:16,590
Whoa.

2088
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:21,660
It's cool.

2089
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:23,500
What is this?

2090
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:26,140
Oh, he's like an architect.

2091
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:28,520
Not an architect, but you know.

2092
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:32,480
Maybe he wanted to be one.

2093
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:34,500
Follow the gamer paint!

2094
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:36,360
Let's follow the gamer paint!

2095
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:37,840
It's made for me!

02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:56,700

everything you're so right can you imagine being like nine

2099
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:17,500

2100
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:20,340
Extra, extra.

2101
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:21,500
American newspaper.

2102
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:26,760
Baby.

2103
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:36,720
Milton Finch in the magic paintbrush.

2104
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:37,940
Oh.

2105
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:48,180
Oh,

2106
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:54,290
he's drawing.

2107
02:27:54,430 --> 02:27:54,850
Oh, my gosh.

2108
02:27:55,970 --> 02:27:56,150
Whoa.

2109
02:27:56,430 --> 02:27:57,230
Flipbook Inception.

2110
02:27:58,890 --> 02:27:59,750
Oh, the door works.

2111
02:27:59,930 --> 02:28:00,690
The door works.

2112
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,240
This game go hard.

2113
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:15,620
I love the different medium.

2114
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:15,940
Wait.

2115
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:19,740
I was four when Milton disappeared.

2116
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:22,560
I'm dirty too.

2117
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:28,460
Milton went into the door.

2118
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:39,180
mom spent months searching for my brother then she sealed
the doors

2119
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:53,060
whatever milton had found in the house mom didn't want it
getting out

2120
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:10,620
oh there's an upstairs oh my gosh the game is pretty good
about leading you places obviously i was mom definitely

2121
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:19,680
blamed edie but i think lewis blamed himself are so busy
looking at this you don't notice the staircase behind you

2122
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:28,220
it's kind of cool mat flow design is great after he
graduated he just spent more and more time in his room until

2123
02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:40,180
mom got him a job at the cannery the cannery with the tuna
he didn't needed a caretaker after my mom left for india we

2124
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:45,560
hired a maid to help take care of her at the house mint was
her name Maid Min didn't do much cleaning, but was fond of

2125
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:45,960
singing.

2126
02:29:46,300 --> 02:29:48,320
She passed an audition and left for the East.

2127
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,180
Haven't seen her since.

2128
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:55,700
Thank you so much for the pink.

2129
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:57,020
Thank you.

2130
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:57,540
Lewis.

2131
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:01,560
Everyone always told me to stay out of Lewis's room.

2132
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:03,160
Except Lewis.

2133
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:05,840
I got an achievement for looking through all the peoples.

2134
02:30:07,660 --> 02:30:08,040
Whoa.

2135
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:09,320
Wait.

2136
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:11,680
What was...

2137
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:16,000
Is that a drug?

2138
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:17,280
Is that?

2139
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:20,120
Is that?

2140
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:26,280
Is this broken?

2141
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:27,040
Yes.

2142
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:41,100
Because I don't know how she trusts this place, man.

2143
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:44,560
Like, who built this to begin with, even?

2144
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:50,080
What did other people think of the town, I wonder?

2145
02:30:56,820 --> 02:30:58,780
This reminds me, though, of...

2146
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:12,580
where my sister lives truly actually I think she moved I
think she moved but she lived in this place and she would

2147
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:25,400
have like it was like a big a big big property and no like
these little tree house looking places the people that she

2148
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:35,180
bought it from they've made stuff that looks like this and
they would do like rituals on the property my sister bought

2149
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:42,840
it so that she could keep doing rituals on the property i
think she just got i think she just sold it recently

2150
02:31:58,620 --> 02:32:12,660
louis's room smelled very very familiar that part of him
lived on the stank that's the worst can you imagine louis

2151
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:16,560
stunk so bad that his His room still smelled like him.

2152
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:18,440
That's terrible.

2153
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:25,160
Lewis and I spent a lot of time playing games together, but
he was surprisingly bad at them.

2154
02:32:25,480 --> 02:32:26,640
He died a lot.

2155
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:29,000
Oh, I...

2156
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:29,920
I...

2157
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:31,320
I...

2158
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:33,380
Yeah.

2159
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:36,240
He was so proud of being Indian.

2160
02:32:36,860 --> 02:32:41,400
I think for him, it was a way to be something other than
just a Finch.

2161
02:32:43,740 --> 02:32:44,200
Whoa.

2162
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:50,800
Yeah, I thought it was just like, he died.

2163
02:32:52,460 --> 02:32:53,440
That's what I thought.

2164
02:32:56,060 --> 02:32:57,100
My guy's a gamer.

2165
02:33:00,870 --> 02:33:02,030
Oh, what do we have in here?

2166
02:33:03,350 --> 02:33:04,270
Oliver Twist!

2167
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:13,480
Oh, he watches the same thing.

2168
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:15,740
Like, conspiracy now.

2169
02:33:16,660 --> 02:33:18,300
And their wedding for some reason.

2170
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:19,420
Oh, well.

2171
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:20,460
Oh, my guy's a gamer.

2172
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:25,780
He's got figures and everything.

2173
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:31,190
All right, let's check it out.

2174
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:45,960
Dear Mrs. Finch, as Lewis's psychiatrist, I can understand
your desire for an explanation.

2175
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:52,720
As I see it, the trouble began in January, shortly after we
convinced your son to seek treatment for substance abuse.

2176
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:53,360
Ooh!

2177
02:33:53,540 --> 02:33:58,020
Newly sober, I believe Lewis first noticed the monotony of
his daily life.

2178
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:01,260
Oh, gosh.

2179
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:04,660
He kept working at the cannery.

2180
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:07,680
But he withdrew part of himself.

2181
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:10,240
It looks like the arm from Poppy's playtime.

2182
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:13,140
In our sessions, I saw the same behavior.

2183
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:15,980
At least...

2184
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:17,340
His mind began to...

2185
02:34:18,860 --> 02:34:22,340
At least I'm blocking the fish getting decapitated.

2186
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:30,560
them began to I

2187
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:37,380
began to what

2188
02:34:42,010 --> 02:34:45,790
is that I can't even grab it

2189
02:34:50,480 --> 02:35:07,220
wonder oh he's a little guy I asked him to describe it he
said he started to

2190
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:11,980
Imagining a labyrinth.

2191
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:19,880
I'm doing my job, I'm doing my job.

2192
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:24,240
I'm still being a good employee.

2193
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:31,760
He'd feel his way about.

2194
02:35:33,140 --> 02:35:33,680
Yeah.

2195
02:35:37,580 --> 02:35:39,160
I'm so concentrated right now.

2196
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:42,480
Something moved.

2197
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:48,300
And toads?

2198
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:49,380
Ooh.

2199
02:35:54,000 --> 02:36:01,500
You can tell when I'm, like, getting confused, like, I'm
grabbing it and I'll make him go this way, you know?

2200
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:04,040
And things that have not names.

2201
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:12,620
He knew it was all in his head.

2202
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:15,700
Oh, freaky.

2203
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:20,160
But he took it very seriously.

2204
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:23,380
I had hoped he'd find himself.

2205
02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:32,850
I'm so good at doing my job.

2206
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:35,310
But he found something more.

2207
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:38,450
Whoa!

2208
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:42,170
Can I just stop doing my job?

2209
02:36:44,210 --> 02:36:45,470
I worried about him then.

2210
02:36:48,410 --> 02:36:49,630
Daydreaming at the cannery.

2211
02:36:50,270 --> 02:36:53,070
Yeah, you probably want to concentrate on this kind of joke.

2212
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:53,950
I spoke with his boss.

2213
02:36:56,030 --> 02:36:58,450
But he said Lewis had become a model employee.

2214
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:00,230
Methodical.

2215
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:00,910
Tireless.

2216
02:37:01,170 --> 02:37:01,490
Focus.

2217
02:37:01,750 --> 02:37:04,450
Yeah, because that's all he's not even thinking about it.

2218
02:37:04,570 --> 02:37:06,530
He's just doing the motions.

2219
02:37:07,290 --> 02:37:08,350
Like a whole new Lewis.

2220
02:37:09,350 --> 02:37:11,390
I'm gonna let the fish see what happens if I don't...

2221
02:37:11,390 --> 02:37:12,410
So I let him go on.

2222
02:37:12,990 --> 02:37:13,750
Touch the fish.

2223
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:20,440
Whoa, I even encouraged him.

2224
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,000
It's getting bigger.

2225
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,940
Hey, you're... I mean, I'm playing my game.

2226
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:26,100
Get out of the way, fish.

2227
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:27,520
Get out of the way, fish.

2228
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:29,060
It seemed very promising at first.

2229
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:34,820
He told me he'd made a new friend.

2230
02:37:41,450 --> 02:37:43,790
Ooh, the fish kind of get in the way too, though.

2231
02:37:44,030 --> 02:37:46,690
On the edge of a city he named Louis Topia.

2232
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:47,810
Louis Topia.

2233
02:37:48,910 --> 02:37:50,190
Do I have to cut off the fish?

2234
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:51,350
Ah!

2235
02:37:52,710 --> 02:37:53,150
Crazy.

2236
02:37:53,310 --> 02:37:54,310
Oh, that's so cool!

2237
02:37:54,790 --> 02:37:56,930
He built the city up slowly, brick by brick.

2238
02:37:58,310 --> 02:37:59,850
Thank you, thank you, Bard.

2239
02:38:00,030 --> 02:38:01,110
Thank you, thank you.

2240
02:38:01,770 --> 02:38:02,590
I'm home.

2241
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:03,550
I'm here.

2242
02:38:03,610 --> 02:38:04,730
Then he made musicians.

2243
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:12,940
Yes, yes, I'm home.

2244
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:14,960
You're great leaders here.

2245
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,080
And songs for them to play.

2246
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:22,620
He talked about starting a band.

2247
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:23,380
Oh.

2248
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:26,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2249
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:27,840
And he was always humming something.

2250
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,180
The little people dancing are so cute.

2251
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:42,720
every day his imagination grew stronger this is actually he
no longer spoke at the cannery

2252
02:38:45,960 --> 02:38:59,160
help this way but his chopping was as reliable as ever you
gotta be careful of your hand yeah at all the cheering

2253
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:03,140
crowds even the stones under his We're fake.

2254
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:06,080
We're all in his imagination.

2255
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:09,680
So he could do whatever he wished.

2256
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:12,880
Whoa.

2257
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:17,220
He held an election for men.

2258
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,020
When he is an election, if you're...

2259
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:21,660
And he won.

2260
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:22,840
Really?

2261
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:24,740
Haha.

2262
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:31,260
They begged him to stay, but his mind was already wandering.

2263
02:39:33,460 --> 02:39:33,960
Oh.

2264
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:35,600
It became a game for him.

2265
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:37,420
Oh, oh.

2266
02:39:38,220 --> 02:39:39,840
Hey, get out of the way, I'm playing my game.

2267
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:41,780
Lewis-topia.

2268
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:42,920
No more.

2269
02:39:43,140 --> 02:39:47,920
Can I conquer this city?

2270
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:49,840
Can I conquer this city?

2271
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:50,980
New Lewisville.

2272
02:39:55,850 --> 02:39:57,410
I think there's only two fish at a time.

2273
02:39:57,710 --> 02:39:58,010
St. Louis.

2274
02:39:58,390 --> 02:39:59,430
St. Louis.

2275
02:40:00,630 --> 02:40:03,150
He started drifting away from our reality.

2276
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:10,940
These kids in there are video games.

2277
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:15,400
Until one day he forgot to go home from the cannery.

2278
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:17,300
Oh, that's not good.

2279
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:22,280
Even as his mother pleaded with him, part of Lewis kept
sailing on.

2280
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,200
He's just doing it.

2281
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:29,580
Oh, we're just...

2282
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:31,900
He's so into the game in his brain.

2283
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:38,460
In Lewisburg, he heard rumors of a...

2284
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,720
Uh...

2285
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:44,160
Oh, we can have a handsome queen?

2286
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:47,840
Or a beautiful prince.

2287
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:52,640
I want the handsome queen, though.

2288
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:54,440
Why is she handsome?

2289
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:55,700
Yeah.

2290
02:40:58,220 --> 02:41:01,080
I want to know what a handsome queen is like.

2291
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:04,480
Oh, yeah, baby.

2292
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:08,960
Cool.

2293
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:11,580
Hey, get out of the way, fish.

2294
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:13,340
That's my handsome queen here on top.

2295
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:15,980
For...

2296
02:41:15,980 --> 02:41:16,420
For...

2297
02:41:16,420 --> 02:41:18,060
Sinister serpents.

2298
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:20,280
Sinister serpents.

2299
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:20,860
Nice.

2300
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:22,600
Oh my gosh, it's a choose your own adventure.

2301
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:24,860
Woo!

2302
02:41:26,460 --> 02:41:27,020
Woo!

2303
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:33,100
I'm getting sucked into the brain game.

2304
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:34,260
The sound of her.

2305
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:36,120
The sound of her.

2306
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:38,280
Uh...

2307
02:41:46,390 --> 02:41:48,190
Electric sitar Whoa

2308
02:41:55,770 --> 02:41:56,970
Oops, I missed one.

2309
02:41:57,250 --> 02:41:58,110
Wait, go through.

2310
02:41:59,010 --> 02:41:59,170
No!

2311
02:41:59,710 --> 02:42:00,370
I missed it.

2312
02:42:01,190 --> 02:42:01,570
Turn around.

2313
02:42:02,230 --> 02:42:02,530
Turn around.

2314
02:42:03,850 --> 02:42:04,150
I missed.

2315
02:42:04,570 --> 02:42:04,690
Oh, dang it.

2316
02:42:04,850 --> 02:42:08,770
His chase led him to a golden palace east of the sun and
west of the moon.

2317
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:10,610
Dang it.

2318
02:42:10,990 --> 02:42:11,550
Whoa.

2319
02:42:14,230 --> 02:42:16,770
Even then, his logic remained sound.

2320
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:18,190
Oh, oh my gosh.

2321
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:20,750
Oh, it's completely taken over.

2322
02:42:22,010 --> 02:42:22,470
Oh my god.

2323
02:42:23,390 --> 02:42:24,650
Are we gonna get our hand chopped off?

2324
02:42:24,790 --> 02:42:26,570
He knew the world was all in his imagination.

2325
02:42:27,070 --> 02:42:27,910
There's too many fish!

2326
02:42:29,810 --> 02:42:30,730
But he can't stop.

2327
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:32,270
He can't stop thinking about it.

2328
02:42:34,030 --> 02:42:35,690
Otherwise, all you think about is fish.

2329
02:42:37,350 --> 02:42:38,810
Well, we're in a totally different game.

2330
02:42:39,090 --> 02:42:40,210
But he's so proud of having created it.

2331
02:42:43,430 --> 02:42:43,850
Ugh!

2332
02:42:44,750 --> 02:42:46,770
In his own eyes, he becomes...

2333
02:42:46,790 --> 02:42:52,630
something greater than a king whoa hey

2334
02:42:56,210 --> 02:42:59,470
get out of the way fish for someone who'd never known
success get down mr.

2335
02:42:59,750 --> 02:43:10,110
president I'm protecting you from the fish it's the little
that the real Lewis was not the one chopping salmon but the

2336
02:43:10,110 --> 02:43:15,070
one climbing the steps of a golden palace oh yeah

2337
02:43:18,450 --> 02:43:30,830
my imagination is as real as my body he told me what do we
look like nice it was hard to argue with him what's the

2338
02:43:30,830 --> 02:43:40,890
point of having a giant door up here oh our arm is gone oh
oh oh this is where we are but we think we're in the golden

2339
02:43:40,890 --> 02:43:55,850
palace this is where we really are though wait we finally
stopped the fish this is me this is my locker oh they love

2340
02:43:55,850 --> 02:44:07,960
chinese food wait no my my switch i began to forget the
world we know

2341
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:24,920
i think it pained him to remember lewis the cannery worker i
get it Wait, are they just dropping...

2342
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:27,640
Are these alive fish or...

2343
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:28,440
Dead fish?

2344
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:33,460
That's him doing the job!

2345
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:37,820
2DS, yeah, 2DS.

2346
02:44:41,330 --> 02:44:44,130
He began to despise the man with a royal contempt.

2347
02:44:46,570 --> 02:44:49,190
He's got his football jersey on.

2348
02:44:50,690 --> 02:44:52,930
But you're not even doing anything anymore!

2349
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:03,220
Do I go up?

2350
02:45:08,290 --> 02:45:09,910
I still thought I could save him.

2351
02:45:21,020 --> 02:45:25,080
Even after he said he was being crowned king over all the
lands of Wanda.

2352
02:45:36,710 --> 02:45:38,810
The palace would be packed with his companions.

2353
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:55,120
But he should have...

2354
02:45:55,140 --> 02:46:02,880
become like a game dev or something he should have like made
his own game from including the wise Calico who'd insisted

2355
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:08,760
on advising him you know sir

2356
02:46:35,950 --> 02:46:53,930
sir his queen waited holding his crown my hand oh oh oh
there was only one thing left to do oh Oh,

2357
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:06,640
um, sir, I think they're, they're, they're, they're tricking
you.

2358
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:09,080
I think they're, this is a bamboozle.

2359
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:14,140
I think anybody would realize.

2360
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:20,960
I think anybody would see, that's not how you put on a
crown.

2361
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:22,560
I think.

2362
02:47:24,180 --> 02:47:26,140
The queen is sure as handsome.

2363
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:28,320
Bend down his head.

2364
02:47:45,370 --> 02:47:47,030
And the rest I think you know.

2365
02:47:48,190 --> 02:47:52,410
Mrs. Finch, your son was a kind man who will be missed by
all of us who knew him.

2366
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:04,800
My brother was really cool.

2367
02:48:05,620 --> 02:48:06,520
I wish you could have met him.

2368
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:08,320
Aww.

2369
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:14,480
Oh my god.

2370
02:48:16,880 --> 02:48:19,120
How did the doctor not pick up on this?

2371
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:20,880
How did the doctor...

2372
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:24,620
I feel like she...

2373
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:25,300
Oh my god.

2374
02:48:25,640 --> 02:48:27,280
Not the hat having like...

2375
02:48:27,300 --> 02:48:29,620
The, the, the, what's it called?

2376
02:48:30,380 --> 02:48:32,340
The tuna blood stains on it.

2377
02:48:40,750 --> 02:48:41,190
Cigars.

2378
02:48:52,490 --> 02:48:53,650
Sure, that's from the fish.

2379
02:48:53,790 --> 02:48:54,650
I sure hope so.

2380
02:48:55,170 --> 02:48:56,510
Let's just, let's just, let's just.

2381
02:48:56,730 --> 02:48:57,850
I'm back from Lewis's funeral.

2382
02:48:58,470 --> 02:48:59,850
My mom told me to start packing.

2383
02:49:00,610 --> 02:49:03,090
She waited until the day before we left to tell Edie.

2384
02:49:05,530 --> 02:49:08,230
I'm not sure if she wanted to make it easier or harder.

2385
02:49:08,970 --> 02:49:09,230
Hmm.

2386
02:49:10,850 --> 02:49:11,910
Where do you go?

2387
02:49:12,030 --> 02:49:19,810
Oh my sweet stayed There's so many

2388
02:49:23,130 --> 02:49:29,230
It's implied he committed forever sleep or fell asleep on
his day From his daydream at work onto the bell I think yeah

2389
02:49:29,230 --> 02:49:39,870
I wouldn't I mean I don't think it makes it any easier but I
feel like Fell asleep Feels a little nicer than Than

2390
02:49:39,870 --> 02:49:41,350
committed forever sleep

2391
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:52,250
We feel asleep.

2392
02:49:52,370 --> 02:49:53,590
But I understand why we left.

2393
02:49:54,490 --> 02:49:55,030
Oh, wait.

2394
02:49:56,570 --> 02:49:57,010
Oh, yeah.

2395
02:49:57,290 --> 02:49:57,810
That's the good...

2396
02:49:57,810 --> 02:49:58,010
Oh.

2397
02:49:58,570 --> 02:49:59,630
That's the good stuff.

2398
02:50:00,750 --> 02:50:00,870
Oh.

2399
02:50:01,430 --> 02:50:02,210
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2400
02:50:02,630 --> 02:50:03,810
Turn it up, baby.

2401
02:50:05,170 --> 02:50:05,930
Oh, come on.

2402
02:50:06,270 --> 02:50:06,910
Oh, yeah.

2403
02:50:07,790 --> 02:50:08,970
Oh, that's the good stuff.

2404
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:10,970
Oh, oh, yeah.

2405
02:50:11,110 --> 02:50:12,010
Give me more peanuts.

2406
02:50:12,730 --> 02:50:12,850
Oh.

2407
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:27,140
Just a little more.

2408
02:50:27,220 --> 02:50:27,680
Just a little more.

2409
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:33,060
Okay.

2410
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:40,540
The one-finch kitchen.

2411
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:43,460
But why did they leave in such like a hurry is my thing?

2412
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:45,220
Like they took nothing.

2413
02:50:46,340 --> 02:50:47,320
They left everything.

2414
02:50:55,940 --> 02:50:58,320
Is it because it was like a too painful of a memory?

2415
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:00,040
My mom ended up leaving everything behind.

2416
02:51:00,140 --> 02:51:01,080
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2417
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:12,340
Just desperate to get away from the home, I guess, maybe.

2418
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:16,020
Disaster relief.

2419
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:17,080
Oh.

2420
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:20,160
Whoa.

2421
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:23,760
To teach and to learn.

2422
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:27,720
Orca's publishing.

2423
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,220
It really is full of Yuri.

2424
02:51:35,480 --> 02:51:38,200
What happened that night had been coming for a long time.

2425
02:51:40,460 --> 02:51:41,620
Maybe it should have come sooner.

2426
02:51:44,220 --> 02:51:45,180
My room.

2427
02:51:50,580 --> 02:51:52,460
But it had to end one way or another.

2428
02:51:53,720 --> 02:51:54,700
Oh, so cute.

2429
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:55,180
Oh my gosh.

2430
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:57,660
All that's left now was to tell you about that last night.

2431
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:04,260
Yeah, he passed away too, but we don't quite know how.

2432
02:52:05,900 --> 02:52:07,580
How Papa passed away.

2433
02:52:08,560 --> 02:52:10,220
This room is so cute.

2434
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:12,660
Why are there so many unmarked books?

2435
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:14,600
But they're so aesthetically pleasing.

2436
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:15,420
I don't mind.

2437
02:52:17,240 --> 02:52:19,540
Oh wow, that's so cool!

2438
02:52:20,680 --> 02:52:22,600
She made the house like with paper mache.

2439
02:52:25,220 --> 02:52:26,820
Suddenly, are we crawling again?

2440
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:28,280
Yeah, why are we doing that?

2441
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:30,760
I don't think it's that low of a ceiling.

2442
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:42,040
Little guys, she loves making little guys, little figures.

2443
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:43,440
These ones are creepy though.

2444
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:48,320
I think you missed Dawn's death in her room.

2445
02:52:51,580 --> 02:52:52,220
Did I?

2446
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:57,700
She's 10 feet tall.

2447
02:53:06,180 --> 02:53:07,100
Oh, I didn't.

2448
02:53:10,260 --> 02:53:13,040
I was gonna say, it's really hard to miss stuff in this
game, no?

2449
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:14,260
I didn't miss anything.

2450
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:15,360
Okay, thank you guys.

2451
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:18,080
It was a one guy.

2452
02:53:18,780 --> 02:53:19,400
Thank you!

2453
02:53:27,070 --> 02:53:28,470
Yeah, I feel like it's really...

2454
02:53:28,470 --> 02:53:29,550
The game is so linear.

2455
02:53:29,650 --> 02:53:31,790
I don't know how you could miss anything, to be honest.

2456
02:53:46,710 --> 02:53:56,270
Edith Finch That whole last day Edie just watched his pack
and didn't say a word She's leaving her whole house Until

2457
02:53:56,270 --> 02:54:06,410
supper when she raised her glass and said To our final night
together And all our final nights apart Grandma, you know

2458
02:54:06,410 --> 02:54:13,390
what I said about alcohol Some of your medications are very
specific I left a present for you in the hallway Why don't

2459
02:54:13,390 --> 02:54:21,970
you go open it the grown-ups have to argue now I'm sorry
you're right we're all leaving tomorrow let's just enjoy I'm

2460
02:54:21,970 --> 02:54:32,410
not leaving Edith you're excused she's she eating with a
single chopstick the

2461
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:52,760
power had been shut off that morning but Edie always had
plenty of candles that seems really dangerous when my mom

2462
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:53,560
said of the library.

2463
02:54:53,820 --> 02:54:55,740
I don't think she knew about the other entrance.

2464
02:54:56,260 --> 02:54:56,520
Other end?

2465
02:54:57,180 --> 02:54:57,660
Here.

2466
02:54:58,800 --> 02:55:00,820
Or that Edie had a key to it.

2467
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:01,600
Whoa.

2468
02:55:04,360 --> 02:55:07,300
Yeah, especially in this house, on top of all these books.

2469
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:11,420
It's no wonder the place didn't catch on fire.

2470
02:55:12,300 --> 02:55:14,280
Unless it's about to somehow.

2471
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:22,000
That thing you're afraid of isn't going to end when you
leave the house.

2472
02:55:32,940 --> 02:55:40,400
I don't blame the mom, honestly.

2473
02:55:41,900 --> 02:55:44,860
We'll have the nursing home send a van for you in the
morning.

2474
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:50,020
Mimi, hi!

2475
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:54,340
Oh, this game is kind of sad.

2476
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:59,140
History of the Finches.

2477
02:56:01,220 --> 02:56:08,240
Dear Edith, there's so many stories I wish I could tell you,
but there's only time for one.

2478
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:12,080
This is about what happened on the night you were born.

2479
02:56:12,700 --> 02:56:13,760
There's more!

2480
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:17,460
That night, the tide went way, way out.

2481
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:18,720
Oh my gosh.

2482
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:23,940
I mean, I guess there are still people in our journal that
we haven't written about, but holy cow.

2483
02:56:27,720 --> 02:56:29,460
Is someone going to the...

2484
02:56:29,460 --> 02:56:34,500
It was the first and last time I ever saw the old house
aground.

2485
02:56:34,680 --> 02:56:36,400
Yeah, I was going to say, is someone going to the house?

2486
02:56:36,980 --> 02:56:40,220
There's been an earthquake out in the middle of the ocean.

2487
02:56:41,020 --> 02:56:42,620
Oh, so there's just going to be a tsunami.

2488
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:45,820
The lowest tide in a thousand years.

2489
02:56:45,860 --> 02:56:48,400
But when the water pulls back, that's not good!

2490
02:56:48,740 --> 02:56:48,840
God, it smells awful.

2491
02:56:49,560 --> 02:56:53,920
You know, I've seen that house every day of my life.

2492
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:58,180
Oh, gosh.

2493
02:57:00,680 --> 02:57:03,400
But I never thought I'd go back to it.

2494
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:09,620
When the fog roared in, I lost my way.

2495
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:10,540
Oh, my God!

2496
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:15,040
Just look for the red light.

2497
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:18,020
Uh, oh.

2498
02:57:18,020 --> 02:57:19,500
I got turned around.

2499
02:57:19,960 --> 02:57:22,680
No, I was definitely going straight towards it.

2500
02:57:23,480 --> 02:57:23,920
Oh, my gosh.

2501
02:57:23,940 --> 02:57:25,320
Silent Hill moment.

2502
02:57:29,780 --> 02:57:30,080
Uh.

2503
02:57:31,380 --> 02:57:33,640
For a while, I wondered.

2504
02:57:34,060 --> 02:57:35,520
Yeah, Grandma's got the plot armor.

2505
02:57:37,620 --> 02:57:40,000
I started seeing things.

2506
02:57:41,500 --> 02:57:44,000
No, I think that guy might actually be there.

2507
02:57:45,800 --> 02:57:48,640
Or he senses that there's grave danger.

2508
02:57:50,380 --> 02:57:53,000
Things I'd forgotten had ever existed.

2509
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:54,520
Where are you talking?

2510
02:57:54,780 --> 02:57:54,940
Oh, here.

2511
02:57:56,540 --> 02:57:57,660
What kind of things?

2512
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:06,160
But when I saw them, they felt like old friends.

2513
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:08,440
Oh, your old bed for him.

2514
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:11,280
Would you even remember?

2515
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:14,680
That night, a lot of things came back to me.

2516
02:58:15,640 --> 02:58:15,940
Whoa.

2517
02:58:16,100 --> 02:58:16,900
Would you even remember?

2518
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:19,520
Well, some of these things I probably would remember, like
the stove.

2519
02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:22,460
Maybe certain chairs.

2520
02:58:22,580 --> 02:58:23,700
Oh, my God, the toilet.

2521
02:58:25,640 --> 02:58:25,960
Oh.

2522
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:29,140
Oh, I'd know that toilet from anywhere.

2523
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:33,240
Or maybe I came back to them.

2524
02:58:34,280 --> 02:58:37,500
Oh my gosh, the gate is all set up.

2525
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:38,580
Like, it was just...

2526
02:58:38,580 --> 02:58:40,400
It's like just a normal old house.

2527
02:58:41,500 --> 02:58:42,300
That's crazy.

2528
02:58:43,720 --> 02:58:48,240
Things I can't explain, but that I need you to try.

2529
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:50,040
Edith, what are you doing in here?

2530
02:58:50,780 --> 02:58:51,500
It's mine.

2531
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:52,140
Edith!

2532
02:58:52,520 --> 02:58:54,120
Mom, you're gonna rip it, let go!

2533
02:58:57,340 --> 02:58:57,800
Oh!

2534
02:58:57,920 --> 02:59:01,540
I kicked and screamed, but mom dragged me to the car.

2535
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,320
I never saw Great Grandma Edie again.

2536
02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:08,320
Grandma!

2537
02:59:11,540 --> 02:59:15,540
The next morning, the van came to pick her up, but she was
already gone.

2538
02:59:16,780 --> 02:59:17,480
Where'd she go?

2539
02:59:18,400 --> 02:59:20,080
After that, we moved around a lot.

2540
02:59:28,250 --> 02:59:29,970
We both tried to make the best of it.

2541
02:59:37,010 --> 02:59:40,410
A few years went by.

2542
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:55,560
My mom didn't like to talk about it, but she started getting
sick a lot.

2543
02:59:56,960 --> 02:59:59,660
The rest happened pretty quickly.

2544
03:00:03,620 --> 03:00:09,620
She got better for a while, and then she didn't.

2545
03:00:13,380 --> 03:00:14,600
And then I was alone.

2546
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:21,460
The last Finch left alive.

2547
03:00:25,060 --> 03:00:25,900
That's crazy.

2548
03:00:26,020 --> 03:00:27,120
Until I found out about you.

2549
03:00:30,480 --> 03:00:32,880
I'm still not sure what to tell you about all this.

2550
03:00:34,500 --> 03:00:35,560
Am I the baby?

2551
03:00:35,660 --> 03:00:39,180
If we lived forever, maybe we'd have time to understand
things.

2552
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:44,580
But as it is, I think the best we can do is try to open our
eyes.

2553
03:00:44,820 --> 03:00:46,260
I think I'm the baby and the woman.

2554
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:47,080
home right now.

2555
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:50,620
I appreciate how strange and brief all of this is.

2556
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:51,580
Oh my god.

2557
03:00:51,740 --> 03:00:52,680
I'm being bored.

2558
03:00:53,240 --> 03:00:53,820
Oh my god.

2559
03:00:54,120 --> 03:00:54,760
Oh my god.

2560
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:55,920
Oh my god.

2561
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:57,260
I'm being born.

2562
03:00:58,980 --> 03:00:59,200
Everybody.

2563
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:00,960
This is not a drill.

2564
03:01:03,220 --> 03:01:05,320
I think I'm being birthed.

2565
03:01:05,420 --> 03:01:05,700
Wait.

2566
03:01:05,980 --> 03:01:06,600
Oh my god.

2567
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:08,320
But now I hope you'll never see it.

2568
03:01:08,540 --> 03:01:10,980
I'm being reincarnated at this very moment.

2569
03:01:11,180 --> 03:01:14,760
I just want to meet you and tell you all these stories
myself.

2570
03:01:17,500 --> 03:01:18,600
I'm going in!

2571
03:01:18,760 --> 03:01:20,320
I guess if you're reading this now.

2572
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:24,460
Things didn't work out that way.

2573
03:01:31,420 --> 03:01:32,340
Wait, what happened?

2574
03:01:32,940 --> 03:01:34,500
This is where your story begins.

2575
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:36,760
I'm sorry I won't be there to see it.

2576
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:41,220
It's a lot to ask, but I don't want you to be sad that I'm
gone.

2577
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:46,060
I want you to be amazed that any of us ever had a chance to
be here at all.

2578
03:01:46,660 --> 03:01:47,120
Good luck.

2579
03:01:47,400 --> 03:01:48,420
Good luck!

2580
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:50,040
That's rich.

2581
03:02:09,370 --> 03:02:17,170
she she died in childbirth what so

2582
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:50,420
were they cursed or oh my god oh the end of everything
finish all stories the baby pictures are so cute it's for us

2583
03:02:50,420 --> 03:02:59,280
to decide i guess you know was some of it them kind of
getting the idea i've heard of stuff like that before though

2584
03:02:59,280 --> 03:03:05,240
where people will be like my family is cursed and they get
it so in their head that their family is cursed that like

2585
03:03:05,240 --> 03:03:13,020
they're just like they're that they like i don't know it's
not that they bring the misfortune upon themselves but like

2586
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:17,400
they manifest it in a way yeah kind of

2587
03:03:22,470 --> 03:03:29,170
because even like um who was it not lewis um Not Milton.

2588
03:03:29,690 --> 03:03:31,510
The guy that was living under the house.

2589
03:03:32,270 --> 03:03:35,230
He was living under there because he was paranoid of the
curse.

2590
03:03:36,390 --> 03:03:38,050
You know, stuff like that.

2591
03:03:41,960 --> 03:03:42,440
Walter.

2592
03:03:43,160 --> 03:03:43,880
Thank you.

2593
03:03:44,860 --> 03:03:46,540
See Joanne's name in the ending credits.

2594
03:03:47,500 --> 03:03:48,340
Wait, I got an achievement.

2595
03:03:48,700 --> 03:03:49,600
Who's Joanne?

2596
03:03:56,300 --> 03:03:58,060
I was like, I thought it...

2597
03:03:58,060 --> 03:03:58,860
I thought...

2598
03:03:58,860 --> 03:04:00,180
It starts with a W.

2599
03:04:00,320 --> 03:04:00,820
Oh my gosh.

2600
03:04:02,380 --> 03:04:16,100
flip it around Walter Witch I thought the way they conveyed
each story and how each one was done in such a different way

2601
03:04:16,100 --> 03:04:23,940
was really neat they were so it was so engaging seeing like
each story was really kind of fun

2602
03:04:29,970 --> 03:04:35,210
just being told throughout time that your family is cursed
kind of gets to you I feel doesn't help with how you're

2603
03:04:35,210 --> 03:04:36,710
raised yeah that's Fair.

2604
03:04:38,450 --> 03:04:40,790
But also, like, all they...

2605
03:04:40,790 --> 03:04:42,950
It all just was one thing.

2606
03:04:43,690 --> 03:04:46,250
They, they, like, came to the island?

2607
03:04:46,450 --> 03:04:47,450
Oh, my God.

2608
03:04:48,190 --> 03:04:49,150
Holy Melissa.

2609
03:04:52,090 --> 03:04:54,710
They came to the island and then they were like...

2610
03:04:54,710 --> 03:04:56,050
We're cursed, I guess.

2611
03:04:56,890 --> 03:04:59,330
I'm pretty sure physics and poor decision making in them.

2612
03:05:02,010 --> 03:05:02,650
Peaches.

2613
03:05:03,330 --> 03:05:05,610
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches.

2614
03:05:06,370 --> 03:05:09,850
Some of them, though, like, Barbara is...

2615
03:05:09,850 --> 03:05:11,190
That was her name, right, Barbara?

2616
03:05:12,350 --> 03:05:13,550
That one was confusing.

2617
03:05:13,970 --> 03:05:15,750
Why did she pass away?

2618
03:05:16,030 --> 03:05:16,870
How did she die?

2619
03:05:18,090 --> 03:05:21,890
You believe the curse enough that you bring the misfortune
and continued the cycle.

2620
03:05:22,890 --> 03:05:23,270
Ah.

2621
03:05:24,590 --> 03:05:26,330
Yeah, Barbara the Child Star.

2622
03:05:26,530 --> 03:05:28,250
Yeah, that one was...

2623
03:05:28,250 --> 03:05:29,770
That one was strange.

2624
03:05:30,350 --> 03:05:32,170
That one kid just slingshot at himself.

2625
03:05:32,870 --> 03:05:33,410
I...

2626
03:05:34,790 --> 03:05:35,330
I...

2627
03:05:37,810 --> 03:05:44,530
But I mean, some of them did seem like, I mean, there was
just a lot of accidents, so I kind of also get it where it's

2628
03:05:44,530 --> 03:05:45,330
like...

2629
03:05:46,190 --> 03:05:47,570
There's so many accidents.

2630
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:54,490
At what point, how many accidents does it make... Does it
have... Wait, how many accidents have to happen before it's

2631
03:05:54,490 --> 03:05:55,090
like a pattern?

2632
03:05:55,230 --> 03:05:55,870
You know what I mean?

2633
03:06:00,390 --> 03:06:01,930
Some of them were weird deaths.

2634
03:06:02,050 --> 03:06:03,770
Yeah, they were, they were, right?

2635
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:07,790
They were like strange accidents.

2636
03:06:09,530 --> 03:06:11,450
I can't believe one of them.

2637
03:06:11,990 --> 03:06:13,230
Straight up got eaten.

2638
03:06:16,130 --> 03:06:16,990
The end.

2639
03:06:18,590 --> 03:06:21,010
Aww, their little team is so cute.

2640
03:06:32,120 --> 03:06:33,940
Well, replay a story option is now available.

2641
03:06:34,260 --> 03:06:35,360
Select Edith to play from the beginning.

2642
03:06:36,160 --> 03:06:38,040
Oh, I could just go through anybody that I wanted.

2643
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:39,160
Interesting.

2644
03:06:44,620 --> 03:06:45,600
Oh, there's Edie too.

2645
03:06:46,660 --> 03:06:49,160
We never saw her draw Edie or Dawn.

2646
03:06:50,320 --> 03:06:51,920
sense because it was like endgame.

2647
03:06:55,060 --> 03:06:56,780
Edith's son has a cast on his arm.

2648
03:06:56,980 --> 03:06:58,480
The cycle might still be going.

2649
03:06:58,940 --> 03:07:00,140
Wait, no way!

2650
03:07:00,460 --> 03:07:01,440
At the very end?

2651
03:07:06,740 --> 03:07:09,340
Milton looks like Doug funny.

2652
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:13,880
I thought he looked familiar but I couldn't place it.

2653
03:07:15,220 --> 03:07:15,700
I

2654
03:07:23,700 --> 03:07:29,940
I think, oh, it's kind of frustrating that we get no answers
on Milton, but at the same time...

2655
03:07:31,240 --> 03:07:34,620
At the same time, sometimes that's just what happens.

2656
03:07:35,220 --> 03:07:36,860
Sometimes you never know, you know.

2657
03:07:42,300 --> 03:07:44,220
It's not satisfying at all.

2658
03:07:45,380 --> 03:07:46,600
Milton's in another game.

2659
03:07:47,040 --> 03:07:47,520
Wait, what?

2660
03:07:48,820 --> 03:07:52,300
Played the unfinished swan by the same devs.

2661
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:58,540
I was about to say, what if he ran away from home because he
was just like, Like, screw this curse.

2662
03:07:58,900 --> 03:08:01,200
I'm going to go make my own life.

2663
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:06,400
Is it possible to sneak into the library via the secret
entrance?

2664
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:08,600
I don't think the game will let you.

2665
03:08:09,480 --> 03:08:11,220
The game is extremely linear.

2666
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:15,600
It only lets you do things when you can, I think.

2667
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:26,180
The unfinished swan is told a lot like Molly or Gregory
stories.

2668
03:08:27,560 --> 03:08:28,120
Good to know.

2669
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:29,540
Thank you for the warning.

2670
03:08:31,060 --> 03:08:31,320
Hmm.

2671
03:08:35,660 --> 03:08:37,820
I don't know what to expect.

2672
03:08:38,620 --> 03:08:40,800
This was just so depressing.

2673
03:08:43,260 --> 03:08:44,700
This was just so sad.

2674
03:08:44,840 --> 03:08:47,320
It was so fascinating and also so depressing.

2675
03:08:48,780 --> 03:08:51,180
Kind of like a morbid curiosity, I feel.

2676
03:08:51,240 --> 03:09:01,580
I feel like Edith has it too, where it's like a morbid
curiosity of wanting to know how her family died and what's

2677
03:09:01,580 --> 03:09:05,060
going on you know what i mean i

2678
03:09:08,820 --> 03:09:15,780
think i realized what happened to melt and look up the devs
other games yeah that's what people were saying such

2679
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:32,980
a good game but some of it does get to you yeah i didn't
expect it to be so sad like it was just that's the whole

2680
03:09:32,980 --> 03:09:43,900
thing the game is just tragedy after tragedy but you know we
can appreciate these kinds of story-tellings too.

2681
03:09:44,940 --> 03:09:45,600
I suppose.

2682
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:50,360
Hmm.

2683
03:09:50,920 --> 03:09:52,560
Another game for the list, yeah?

2684
03:09:54,260 --> 03:09:55,800
Not much mystery, really.

2685
03:09:55,920 --> 03:09:56,300
Yeah!

2686
03:09:57,100 --> 03:10:01,780
I thought there would be a little more like of a...

2687
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:02,820
It was...

2688
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:04,220
I don't know.

2689
03:10:06,380 --> 03:10:12,680
Like, I was so curious why they, like, up and left such in a
hurry in the very beginning.

2690
03:10:12,780 --> 03:10:14,940
I was like, but why did they just pick up and leave?

2691
03:10:15,900 --> 03:10:19,900
But then, it was just kind of like the mom being like...

2692
03:10:21,700 --> 03:10:25,080
No, I don't want to be here anymore and just left, you know?

2693
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:35,060
Thank you for playing this game, I always wanted to
experience it.

2694
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:37,160
Yeah, of course, of course.

2695
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:45,120
Yeah, they had a fight and mom was just like, see ya.

2696
03:10:45,900 --> 03:10:50,140
And then Grandma left.

2697
03:11:08,380 --> 03:11:09,500
You have to wonder.

2698
03:11:10,020 --> 03:11:14,760
Also, it's just like the mom left, but...

2699
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:17,520
To protect Edith, right?

2700
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:20,340
But was Edith even really protected?

2701
03:11:22,560 --> 03:11:23,400
Like...

2702
03:11:23,400 --> 03:11:27,740
The mom still died, and Edith still died.

2703
03:11:28,480 --> 03:11:28,900
Like...

2704
03:11:29,940 --> 03:11:31,740
What good did it do?

2705
03:11:32,760 --> 03:11:34,340
Grandma is the killer.

2706
03:11:37,400 --> 03:11:45,480
Grandma's been secretly putting like hallucinogenics and or
rat poisoning.

2707
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:49,840
Small traces in the food.

2708
03:11:56,220 --> 03:11:59,520
The hallucinogenics is...

2709
03:12:01,160 --> 03:12:02,460
Definitely a gas.

2710
03:12:02,480 --> 03:12:03,500
A gas.

2711
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:06,000
Gas leak would like really explain a lot.

2712
03:12:06,160 --> 03:12:07,480
But this house is nuts, though.

2713
03:12:08,500 --> 03:12:10,920
You just go to a different part of the house.

2714
03:12:12,320 --> 03:12:14,300
Also, there was like that...

2715
03:12:14,300 --> 03:12:17,300
I guess we went to the upstairs a different way.

2716
03:12:18,420 --> 03:12:20,540
Yeah, there was like the upstairs that was locked.

2717
03:12:25,360 --> 03:12:27,240
Oh my gosh, yes, not a gas leak.

2718
03:12:27,360 --> 03:12:29,040
Black mold infestation.

2719
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:32,200
That will also make you go crazy.

2720
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:33,040
It will.

2721
03:12:33,400 --> 03:12:34,380
Oh my god.

2722
03:12:35,940 --> 03:12:44,240
as simple as that what you wait that would be like such good
like environmental storytelling if like she never talked

2723
03:12:44,240 --> 03:12:51,600
about it but if there would be like mold on like you would
just notice kind of like i mean look there was just so much

2724
03:12:51,600 --> 03:13:01,360
food left out that's not black mold but come on from all the
books like becoming moldy and stuff

2725
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:06,780
bad decisions.

2726
03:13:08,360 --> 03:13:10,940
Yeah, I mean, that doesn't...

2727
03:13:11,660 --> 03:13:13,140
I mean, I don't know.

2728
03:13:22,720 --> 03:13:24,580
Some of it, I guess it does explain to him.

2729
03:13:25,060 --> 03:13:26,660
You know, Molly would be negligence.

2730
03:13:26,780 --> 03:13:28,340
Barbara is just a complete mystery.

2731
03:13:29,960 --> 03:13:30,500
Calvin?

2732
03:13:32,040 --> 03:13:33,660
How did Calvin die again?

2733
03:13:34,100 --> 03:13:38,020
Oh, that probably was bad decisions.

2734
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:41,360
Sam was bad decision.

2735
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:46,240
Walter Walter, the guy just stepped outside, no?

2736
03:13:48,920 --> 03:13:51,060
Gregory was obviously negligence.

2737
03:13:51,260 --> 03:13:55,620
Gus, I think, was half negligence, half bad decision.

2738
03:13:59,560 --> 03:14:03,620
I think the point was that bad circumstances at home tend to
follow you for life.

2739
03:14:04,360 --> 03:14:06,040
Like a generational...

2740
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:08,260
Who breaks the curse?

2741
03:14:08,380 --> 03:14:11,660
Who breaks the generational trauma, you know?

2742
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:13,520
Someone has to.

2743
03:14:14,820 --> 03:14:18,580
Is it just like Edith tried, maybe?

2744
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:20,480
I don't know, but she went back home.

2745
03:14:20,980 --> 03:14:23,140
I don't think she ever really got over it.

2746
03:14:25,120 --> 03:14:26,520
Which I'm not, like, blaming her.

2747
03:14:31,960 --> 03:14:32,480
But...

2748
03:14:32,480 --> 03:14:33,780
She was parkouring.

2749
03:14:34,240 --> 03:14:34,980
With the baby.

2750
03:14:36,760 --> 03:14:39,120
She was parkouring with the baby.

2751
03:14:45,270 --> 03:14:46,970
Milton, Milton, we don't know.

2752
03:14:48,650 --> 03:14:49,690
Lewis was...

2753
03:14:53,540 --> 03:15:18,420
even know just mental two player parkour the baby was was
what's the word the baby was adding was keeping her stable

2754
03:15:18,420 --> 03:15:21,840
that's the word preg core

2755
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:32,720
there's a meta story of Milton and the unfinished swan but I
do like to think Milton just pieced out and ran away from

2756
03:15:32,720 --> 03:15:49,570
this house of crazy I'm right I think Milton was like nah
I'm not gonna end up like everybody else it is a wonder that

2757
03:15:49,570 --> 03:16:00,930
there were even survivors it's kind of it's actually so sad
that at the very end all you have is dawn and edie and edith

2758
03:16:00,930 --> 03:16:11,750
like just three people left in this giant house is so sad
and they louis milton and edith and dawn they all moved

2759
03:16:11,750 --> 03:16:25,830
after they're after the dad died right how did odin die
didn't he went down with the house why did I say mailed when

2760
03:16:25,830 --> 03:16:26,910
they sailed over?

2761
03:16:30,690 --> 03:16:30,990
Yeah.

2762
03:16:32,950 --> 03:16:34,070
He went down with his ship.

2763
03:16:36,810 --> 03:16:37,730
What an interesting game.

2764
03:16:39,950 --> 03:16:40,730
Much to think about.

2765
03:16:43,450 --> 03:16:45,790
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

2766
03:16:46,110 --> 03:16:51,150
Our little sad venture that we went on today.

2767
03:16:52,270 --> 03:16:53,630
Sad venture games, my beloved.

2768
03:16:55,870 --> 03:17:04,590
I wonder if Edie found her father's body in a low tide that
would be so like what if he was what if that light that came

2769
03:17:04,590 --> 03:17:19,700
on in the house what if that's where she saw his body that
would be so sad oh that would be oh my god yay thank you I

2770
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:23,280
actually didn't cry I'm surprised but it was It was heavy,
for sure.

2771
03:17:24,060 --> 03:17:24,980
I tried to keep these.

2772
03:17:25,540 --> 03:17:31,820
I didn't think the whole game would be so heavy, but I try
to keep these kind of lighthearted so we can still have fun

2773
03:17:31,820 --> 03:17:32,560
and everything.

2774
03:17:33,280 --> 03:17:34,660
Dorigo, thank you for the pig.

2775
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:35,820
Thank you, thank you.

2776
03:17:36,780 --> 03:17:41,400
May all the sinister serpents you seek be seen inside a
marvelous and happy dream.

2777
03:17:42,040 --> 03:17:42,800
Thank you.

2778
03:17:45,160 --> 03:17:46,780
It's a downer of a game.

2779
03:17:47,060 --> 03:17:49,380
Yeah, we try to lighten it up, though.

2780
03:17:53,930 --> 03:17:54,910
Gotta not cry.

2781
03:17:54,950 --> 03:18:03,650

2785
03:18:33,110 --> 03:18:34,950
Oh, Scarlet, thank you for modding.

2786
03:18:35,130 --> 03:18:36,910
I'm going to remove your mod powers now.

2787
