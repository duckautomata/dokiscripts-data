1
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,310
YAHO, YAHO, YAHO What's happening?

2
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,470
What's happening?

3
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,510
Why is my chat all gifted?

4
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,910
Why is my chat...

5
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,770
All gift and memberships?

6
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,410
What's happening?

7
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,400
Oops, our gifts.

8
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,280
Thank you!

9
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

10
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,500
Extra belated Oshide.

11
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,760
No, thank you so much.

12
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,800
Whoa!

13
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,780
Even more!

14
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,620
What's happening?

15
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,660
I love being in the year 2007.

16
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,600
Yeah, what are you guys doing?

17
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,760
What are you guys doing?

18
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,500
Did you finish your homework?

19
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:23,300
I'll finish my homework after I play Portal, the newest game on this new platform called Steam.

20
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,820
I've never heard of it before, but apparently you can get games on there.

21
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,680
Oh, yeah.

22
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
What's Roblox?

23
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,580
I've never heard of that before.

24
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you mean Legos?

25
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,820
Those are blocks.

26
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,060
Right.

27
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,500
Fortnite.

28
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,300
You mean you want to come to my house?

29
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:19,840
house and build a fort tonight that sounds fun thank you guys for all the gifts thank you thank you thank you who knows if it'll catch on it probably not like a game like that just sounds too silly

30
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
Unless they add Goku.

31
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,320
If they put Goku...

32
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,060
Roblox came out in 2006.

33
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,220
What?

34
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,060
No, it didn't.

35
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,100
Did it?

36
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,620
If it did, nobody cared about it until...

37
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:49,000
Nobody cared about Roblox until, like, whatever, like, six years...

38
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
How long ago, actually?

39
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,820
I don't even know.

40
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,240
Did it get popular?

41
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,180
during the pandemic?

42
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,500
I don't remember.

43
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,160
I used to play it back in 09.

44
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,680
Then why did it get so popular recently?

45
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
2006 was the year of Roblox.

46
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,260
Well, nobody, well, my statement still stands.

47
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,800
Nobody knew who it was.

48
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,580
Nobody knew.

49
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,680
Nobody, nobody knew.

50
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
The brain rot spreading.

51
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,960
They spent a ton of money on it.

52
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,240
Oh.

53
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,140
Hmm.

54
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,080
Whatever.

55
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,600
Whatever.

56
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,940
Anyways, welcome, guys.

57
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,980
Wait, did I say welcome?

58
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,820
They made a bunch of code changes, which allowed for more things to be made with less limitations.

59
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,180
Okay, if there is, like, a game you want to play, you can find it on Roblox.

60
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:24,100
kind of insane actually have you heard of youtube i can't wait to watch the new smosh video oh yeah youtube yeah that's where my grandpa uploads he he makes videos of him just like mowing the lawn i i told him those would never blow up those those would never get popular do you guys ever watch those videos oh what's that guy's name like be mowing?

61
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,380
I watch those sometimes.

62
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,500
Wisps, I come for the future.

63
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,860
We are at a junction in time, no matter what.

64
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,620
Don't let the gorilla die.

65
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,660
Save who?

66
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,920
Oh my gosh, Brian, you didn't say the rest of the name.

67
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,560
Who are we supposed to save?

68
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,410
I watch the guy that fixes lawns and sidewalks.

69
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,190
Isn't that the same guy as be mowing?

70
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,130
He does that.

71
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,510
Which gorilla?

72
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,770
He's the catalyst.

73
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,370
He's the catalyst.

74
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:07,930
Hmm.

75
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,310
R.I.P.

76
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,150
Can't wait to watch new YouTube poops.

77
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,830
Okay, but, like, YouTube poops are still coming out, which is kind of crazy.

78
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:27,270
Sometimes you'll see one, and you'll be like, well, like, sometimes I'll be like, I'll see, like, a youngin making a YouTube poop, and I'm like, whoa, whoa.

79
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,210
I mean, don't know.

80
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,570
You've created a time paradox.

81
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,190
Crazy to think Portal came free with the Orange Box collection.

82
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,550
I don't even know what that is.

83
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,950
The culture passed down.

84
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,690
YouTube poops are timeless.

85
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,050
Even if maybe one day we don't have YouTube anymore.

86
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,630
Then I still like to believe that they'll exist.

87
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:32,130
whatever whatever platform we have next blim blob blim blob poops oh hop on blim blob guys i just i'm streaming right now live on blim blob everybody everybody get on blim blob blim blob what are you talking oh tick tock no we're all on blim blob oh my gosh use the gorilla the whole time.

88
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,550
I was just thinking about Jimmy James earlier.

89
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,690
Blim Blab has too many ads.

90
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,290
Oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot to do my regulated Blim Blab ad.

91
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,910
To stream on Blim Blab, you must insert to add into your...

92
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,310
I wonder if this will work.

93
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,610
Wait, how do I add...

94
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,410
Create a highlight video, stream marker.

95
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:50,160
How do I in an ad did youtube take that function away from me what's shopping oh gosh product drops um there used to be a button that would allow you to just be like here's an ad and sometimes like a little pop-up would show up and be like hey you should put in an ad right now they took it away maybe because it didn't work wait you see that blim blob bloop oh my gosh yeah sure too we're all about bloops now and bloops they're only five seconds long so they're like you really have to cram all the information at once grizzly adams happy birthday happy birthday

96
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:09,300
oh blim blob don't take that i copyrighted it already what am i oh what what should my ad be oh um

97
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:56,080
you oh um i'm thinking of like a ad that i get sometimes it's so annoying sometimes so tick tock is like especially aggressive and terrible bookmark something that i might be interested in like checking out later i will forever get only ads of that item it's kind of the worst thing ever like they're like you you want this you want this you want this i'm like oh my god it's so bad it's not my birthday oh okay have a nice day

98
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,260
Well, I mean, well, no, because I bookmarked it.

99
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,560
I get women's clothing ads.

100
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,720
Yeah, and do they entice you?

101
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,240
Are you just like this white?

102
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,620
This might look good at me.

103
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,120
YouTube is only marginally less aggressive.

104
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,740
I think I don't get ads on desktop.

105
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,140
I think that's an ad blocker.

106
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,080
If I watch with this channel on mobile, I get...

107
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,660
ads.

108
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,020
Good morning, Minto.

109
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,600
I got this game, but I never played it.

110
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,020
If I play it while you're streaming, would it be like holding hands?

111
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,360
Well, you can't go further than me.

112
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,460
You have to remain at my pace the entire time.

113
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,300
I've seen YouTube now does three ads instead of two.

114
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,520
What?

115
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,240
That's like the one You can skip the ads because I just swipe on through.

116
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,260
So maybe there are a lot of ads, but I just ignore them.

117
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,260
I don't even have to, I just, you know, the unskippable ads are the absolute worst.

118
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,580
Those are the ones that you're just like, oh my gosh, don't you already get enough from me?

119
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,200
I mean, though, I ate cake today.

120
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,520
Well, I'm glad that your cake was not a lie.

121
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,500
I think the cake is real.

122
00:14:29,280 --> 00:15:18,200
I think sorry I just realized um the audio disappears when I click off and I clicked off so remember to make a part two of this video once you hit the 10 minute 59 or 10 minute 59 second minute limit yes yes we have to hit the limit we have to maximize profits that's why every stream will be at part one part two part three part 4 of 10 minutes just like when they used to upload anime and the anime would be in and one episode would be in four parts what don't you happy birthday could I get a wish and tie say

123
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:30,340
uh is that really what it means or not you're can I get a confirmation The cake is real.

124
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,300
Turn around.

125
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,260
Yeah, baby.

126
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,900
Oh, did someone redirect?

127
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,580
Thank you.

128
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,940
Thank you for the redirect.

129
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,920
Thank you so much.

130
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,380
Sorry, I missed who it was.

131
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,960
I sit on the cake every day.

132
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,560
That's right.

133
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,100
That's right.

134
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,560
That's right.

135
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,120
Okay, I'm going to try and say it, but I'm sorry if I say it wrong.

136
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,680
Suk San Wan Gur Naka.

137
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,300
Happy birthday!

138
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,540
Me trying.

139
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,420
I try.

140
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,800
I maybe.

141
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,020
I said it right!

142
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,360
Oh my gosh.

143
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:12,980
Wow.

144
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,920
Maybe I'm good.

145
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,340
Anyway, shall we play Portal?

146
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,460
I have played Portal before.

147
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,280
But it was many, many, many moons ago.

148
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,420
So, I don't remember very much.

149
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,420
So, this will be basically a new experience.

150
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,460
Oh, oh, my gosh.

151
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,180
It's so weird, though, everything.

152
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,780
Because obviously it's Valve and it's from, like, the Half-Life era.

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,620
So, everything feels...

154
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,100
Feels...

155
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,140
I hear something and I'm like, oh, half-life.

156
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,320
I...

157
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,860
Also...

158
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,120
Oh, my gosh.

159
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,280
Can I just say for a second?

160
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,140
Like, how good this game still looks?

161
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,500
I feel, oh my gosh.

162
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:28,340
Just, I wish we could kind of go back to, like, artistic direction where it doesn't rely on ultra-realism so that, you know, the games, I mean, I feel like that's why, like, Metal Gear has held up so well, too, where it just, it looks so good.

163
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,360
Man, it looks...

164
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,660
Yeah.

165
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,640
Just this game still looks so good.

166
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,480
Oh, man.

167
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,360
Does so much with limited resources.

168
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,220
Man.

169
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,500
You play as Jane Half-Life.

170
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,300
After a year of searching, I finally have a job again.

171
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,480
It's not in my original field, but still a good position for now.

172
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,100
Thanks for helping me through some tough times this year.

173
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:54,920
Oh, my God.

174
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:55,980
Congratulations.

175
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,140
Da-da.

176
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,640
What's the timer for?

177
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:12,860
Okay.

178
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,420
Oh, flush it.

179
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,860
Hello.

180
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,980
And, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer Aided Enrichment Center.

181
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,300
We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a question long.

182
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,320
Your specimen has been processed, and we are now ready to begin the test proper.

183
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,000
Before we start, however, keep in mind that also fun.

184
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:53,940
of all enrichment center activities serious injuries may occur for your own safety and the safety of others please refrain from

185
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,520
i'm back the portal will open in three two one

186
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:36,490
styling We're gonna have it the whole time, everybody.

187
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,690
Please proceed into the chamber lock after completing each test.

188
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,530
First, however, note the incandescent particle field across the exit.

189
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:55,470
This aperture science material prevents a patient grip will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it.

190
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,670
For instance, the aperture science weighted storage cube.

191
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:08,470
could you how could you glados how could you my tunes i can't work without my tunes

192
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:37,180
rip party cover of still live can you turn on closed captions oh yes i can thank you would it be under video audio game i'm not what's it under.

193
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,340
Oh, there it is.

194
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,060
There you go.

195
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,980
I missed it.

196
00:20:51,420 --> 00:21:01,300
I was expecting, I was looking for like a little check mark that's like that was for like turn on subtitles.

197
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:32,110
it's right there it's right there please place the weighted storage cube on the 1500 megawatt aperture science heavy duty super colliding super button wait hold on i'm gonna turn i'm gonna change it from closed captions to there we go dialogue only sorry listen to portal radio loop 10 hours

198
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,110
I don't know if I should listen to that.

199
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,330
Whoa!

200
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,430
Um...

201
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,350
Can I open that up again for me, please?

202
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,670
Thank you.

203
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,690
Which one is it?

204
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,710
Oh, that one over there.

205
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:54,970
Okay.

206
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,310
Oh, there we go.

207
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,150
Thank you.

208
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,570
Perfect.

209
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,930
Please move quickly to the chamberlock We got soft-locked immediately in the tutorial?

210
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:10,650
Okay.

211
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,760
I think I almost didn't make it.

212
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,770
Anti-softlock.

213
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,110
I'll find a way.

214
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,610
I'll find a way.

215
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,170
Gosh, it's so iconic, like all of this.

216
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,670
You're doing very well.

217
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,570
Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol.

218
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,530
There she is!

219
00:22:50,990 --> 00:23:02,210
Unintended side effects of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.

220
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,350
What's that mean?

221
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,970
The portal god!

222
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,850
Very good.

223
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,230
You are now in possession of the Aperture Science handheld portal device.

224
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,550
With it, you can create your own portals.

225
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,390
These interdimensional gates have proven to be completely safe.

226
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,370
The device, however, has not.

227
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,430
Do not touch the operational end of the device.

228
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,430
Do not look directly at the operational end of the device.

229
00:23:34,450 --> 00:24:05,870
the device do not submerge the device in liquid even partially most importantly under no circumstances should move I won't don't worry I won't do that only blue for now lame it's so trippy I gotta earn the orange tag What if the grill evaporated?

230
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,850
The what?

231
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,510
The buckles?

232
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,180
What if?

233
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,600
What if it did that?

234
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,600
Please proceed to the chamber, though.

235
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,320
Damn,

236
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,880
she's looking good.

237
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,780
Damn, look at that booty though.

238
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,760
Wait, is there another one up there?

239
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,100
To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, I didn't realize the orange stayed.

240
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,630
Well...

241
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,800
Oh, sorry.

242
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,060
Um, sorry Glados, you can keep talking.

243
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,980
The cake isn't a lie.

244
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,080
Booty shot, booty shot.

245
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,800
The map you just got through, I saw a streamer take five full minutes to complete.

246
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,180
No way.

247
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,670
No!

248
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,080
They had to be just playing.

249
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,400
You're doing quite well.

250
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,320
They had to be just playing.

251
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,540
There's no way.

252
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,120
Whoa!

253
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,740
Can I look at myself?

254
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:32,900
Dang.

255
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,200
Who is that good I see?

256
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,370
Where did- Okay, there we are.

257
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,850
They had to be I know some people...

258
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,910
As part of a required test protocol.

259
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,570
We will not monitor the next test chamber.

260
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,850
You will be entirely on your own.

261
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,650
Good luck.

262
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,610
Oh my gosh, they trust me.

263
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,780
I know like, honestly, I have streamer brain pretty bad sometimes.

264
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,910
So I know it's definitely like...

265
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,150
a real thing.

266
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,850
But like...

267
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,990
There's...

268
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,610
Look.

269
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,070
It's real.

270
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,750
Yeah, it's fake.

271
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,870
Tried gore effect.

272
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,310
The face and body model for Chell was based off voice actor.

273
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,210
Wait, for Samus?

274
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,890
Alicia Glidewell, who played Samus in Smash Bros.

275
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,210
Brawl.

276
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,930
Cool.

277
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,050
Oh, watch your head!

278
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,870
Watch your head!

279
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,750
Where's it coming from?

280
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:57,350
Oh.

281
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,150
Little, little thick.

282
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,290
There we go.

283
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,890
Now you're thinking with portals, Minto.

284
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,450
Hey, oh wait, I'm stupid.

285
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,890
Yes, I am.

286
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,290
I'm always, I'm thinking.

287
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,850
I'm thinking.

288
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,030
For your own safety, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.

289
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:18,990
Sorry.

290
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,870
Oh, she got mad.

291
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,550
I thought they weren't, you said you weren't watching me.

292
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,150
Liar.

293
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,990
You said!

294
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,950
You said!

295
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,890
You weren't watching me.

296
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,370
Liar.

297
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,310
They don't trust me.

298
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,710
Mom doesn't trust me.

299
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:54,150
As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber as an outright fabrication.

300
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:55,810
Good job.

301
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:04,290
As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in three, two, one.

302
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,410
Ugh, my ears.

303
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,990
Um...

304
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,090
Oh.

305
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,230
Whoa!

306
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,190
Enhancing the truth.

307
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,850
So...

308
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,090
Everything that she said...

309
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,630
When she...

310
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,230
When she praised me...

311
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,070
When she said I was doing a good job!

312
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,670
When she said it was beautiful!

313
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:35,150
When she said I was the smartest person ever to exist, it was all a lie!

314
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,870
While safety is one of many enrichment center goals, unbelievable.

315
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,950
You...

316
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,270
Oh.

317
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,510
Subject name here.

318
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,890
Must be pride of.

319
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,610
Subject on how, here.

320
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:49,830
Ghost...

321
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,290
Land.

322
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,730
All true.

323
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,450
Did she say those things?

324
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,590
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,350
It was literally, like, right part of the test.

326
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,890
Ghost Town, USA.

327
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,030
Woo, woo, woo, woo.

328
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,820
I heard her say it twice.

329
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,820
Thrice even.

330
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,300
Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment.

331
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:37,960
However, alarms and flashing hazard lights have been down to agitate the high energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety.

332
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Now use the aperture signs on stationary scaffold to reach the chamber lock.

333
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,260
Wait, I wasn't paying attention?

334
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,260
What got disabled?

335
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,580
Come back?

336
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,540
Thank you.

337
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,300
I'm waiting, patiently.

338
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,440
What if I die here?

339
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,780
Wait, could I...

340
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,160
What if I landed on this?

341
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,860
Would I die?

342
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,700
Wow, that's pretty, uh...

343
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,100
Pretty...

344
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,180
Orange down there.

345
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,610
Yes.

346
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,370
No.

347
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:22,580
Want to try it?

348
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,920
I should save.

349
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,600
You could die in the beta version.

350
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,980
Oh, so they took it out!

351
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,480
Lame.

352
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,780
I wish I could run.

353
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,100
Please know that we have added a consequence for failure.

354
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:46,380
Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death.

355
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,360
Good luck.

356
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
No drinking.

357
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,700
Okay.

358
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,840
Well.

359
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,260
There.

360
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,300
First try.

361
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,580
Easy.

362
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,500
Oh, wait.

363
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,040
Okay.

364
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,920
Oh, wait.

365
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,180
Ow!

366
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,050
Okay.

367
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,110
Let's see.

368
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,050
It's hard when I don't have more than one, you know what I mean?

369
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,130
Where is it?

370
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,710
Troll to crouch.

371
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,410
They're like, just duck, dummy.

372
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,150
Good timing for a red!

373
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:44,610
Ah!

374
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,530
Wait a second.

375
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:59,350
Okay, so if we do this, and then do this, wait, it's just going to be stuck in.

376
00:31:59,390 --> 00:31:59,530
Ow!

377
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,550
Wait.

378
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,310
Wait.

379
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,410
I was trying to...

380
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,230
I don't know what I was trying to do, actually.

381
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,790
Wait, this one actually is stumping me a little bit.

382
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,550
Oh, she's so smart.

383
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:19,870
Yeah!

384
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,750
I thought I could just crouch.

385
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,090
Okay, hold on.

386
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,360
Oh, wait, I think I get it.

387
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,060
I think I get it.

388
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,800
So that...

389
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my gosh.

390
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,180
Okay, and then, uh, here.

391
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,780
Ah!

392
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,660
Wait.

393
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,080
No, you messed it up!

394
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,500
Where'd it go?

395
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:58,020
Okay, go, and then come out through here, and then bounce, and then go to there.

396
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,580
Oh!

397
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,220
Oh my gosh.

398
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,500
And then I go, like, here.

399
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,060
Clutch, I know.

400
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,060
Oh my gosh, the timing was almost so bad.

401
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,300
Please come back.

402
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,400
My ride?

403
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,960
Your Uber?

404
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,300
Your Uber is here.

405
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,480
Okay.

406
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,380
Go for a swim.

407
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,180
It looks...

408
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,320
Scraptily deumptious.

409
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,100
Very impressive.

410
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,820
Please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience.

411
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,060
Yeah, I didn't die.

412
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,820
I merely forgot.

413
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,520
got hit with the forgetty spaghetti bean.

414
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,520
I merely got...

415
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,240
The enrichment center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible.

416
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,700
Make no attempt to solve it.

417
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,020
Impossible, huh?

418
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,100
Impossible, you say.

419
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,240
What's up here anyway?

420
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,900
Thank you.

421
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:35,300
The Enrichment Center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber.

422
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,580
Thank you.

423
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,400
Impossible, huh?

424
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,440
Is there only one?

425
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,660
Fantastic.

426
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:55,860
You remain resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.

427
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,680
I was very sad and pessimistic.

428
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,960
And then I triggered my inner genius.

429
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,760
And I felt good.

430
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,480
Yeah, Mint does the impossible every day.

431
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,560
I do!

432
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,560
Wait.

433
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,080
What do I do?

434
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,960
I...

435
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,920
What do I...

436
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,900
Hello again.

437
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,280
Hello.

438
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,780
I need a momentum?

439
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't know how to run.

440
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,760
Oh, they're like...

441
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:50,240
They were like, if you put it on the ground, you'll go fast.

442
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,200
I...

443
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,160
I didn't, though.

444
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,960
Wee!

445
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,400
Oh.

446
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,990
Oh, up there, okay.

447
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,150
Alright, where can I put it on the girl here?

448
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,930
Oh gosh, it's always this stuff that I'm so trippy, you know?

449
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,410
Ah!

450
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:16,950
Spectacular.

451
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:24,410
You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum or to be more precise how it does not.

452
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,330
Dot.

453
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,070
Oh.

454
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,840
Where's the portal at?

455
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But where?

456
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,960
Oh, okay, okay.

457
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,520
Momentum.

458
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,720
A function of mass and velocity is conserved between portals.

459
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,380
In layman's terms.

460
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,800
Speedy thing goes in.

461
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,160
Speedy thing comes out.

462
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,660
Speedy thing goes in.

463
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,000
Speedy thing comes out.

464
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,340
Easy peasy.

465
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,960
Yes, I understand.

466
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:00,780
Okay.

467
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,860
She won't miss.

468
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,340
We made it.

469
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,440
Did you see that?

470
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,240
Papa, are you watching me now?

471
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,800
She's a gamer.

472
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,820
She's a gamer, gamer.

473
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,460
Imagine doing that in VR.

474
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,220
Terrible.

475
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,960
We're not sad any longer.

476
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,280
No more.

477
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,000
More sad music.

478
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,920
The enrichment center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.

479
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:48,120
In dangerous testing environments, the enrichment center promises to always provide useful advice.

480
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,060
For instance, the floor here will kill you.

481
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,520
Try to avoid it.

482
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,220
Okay.

483
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,580
What just happened?

484
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,420
Wait.

485
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,980
Oh, the thing is moving.

486
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,100
Oh.

487
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,220
Okay, okay.

488
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,240
I was like, oh.

489
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,600
No.

490
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,620
Next one, please.

491
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,700
That's me.

492
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,280
Next, please.

493
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,220
Oh, there it is.

494
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,380
That's our out.

495
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,240
Yippee!

496
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,600
Oh, okay.

497
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,460
This is timed.

498
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,660
All right, hold on.

499
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm...

500
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,280
I think I need to wait for it to shoot me over here.

501
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,160
Mathematizing, yes.

502
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,600
Yehoy!

503
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:49,700
Okay.

504
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,860
And then this guy means to...

505
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,140
Well, I wish I could see.

506
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,600
Oh, wait.

507
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,380
Did I get a first try?

508
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,520
Oh, guys!

509
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,970
Easiest game ever.

510
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,550
Oh!

511
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,430
Oh, that's fine, I suppose.

512
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,190
Oh.

513
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:20,650
Ah!

514
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,350
Ha!

515
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:21,730
Ha!

516
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,660
We made it?

517
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,320
We made it!

518
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,340
The music.

519
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,640
This device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two-linked portals at once.

520
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,020
Yeah!

521
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,260
It's part of an optional test protocol.

522
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,500
How do I get out of here?

523
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:51,200
The device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in.

524
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,960
Subject hometown, here.

525
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:54,680
Interesting.

526
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,360
Full power portal.

527
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,140
What do I, where do I, how do I get out there?

528
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,080
Where do I, how do I, who do I, oh, up there?

529
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:07,980
Wait!

530
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Oh, there's a button!

531
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,840
Oh, I missed it.

532
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,200
Ah, I see, I see.

533
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,540
Okay, so that's blue.

534
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,620
So we need the orange.

535
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,100
Oh, gosh, I'm getting all tripped up.

536
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

537
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,360
Come back, come back.

538
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,240
Everything's fine.

539
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:42,860
Everything's fine.

540
00:40:43,740 --> 00:41:11,880
And we won't do the wrong one you know you know how you accent you meant to do the blue portal and you accidentally do the orange portal hot dog indeed mint rapidly aging me to dust like the end of indiana jones in the last crusade after i drink the water what did i say 30 minutes ago i really wish i could run okay we gotta go fast

541
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,920
Fling myself, huh?

542
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,740
I gotta fling myself?

543
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,960
We're flinging alright.

544
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:23,980
Oh.

545
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,140
I almost made it.

547
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,700
Fast thing goes fast!

548
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:36,860
Oh.

549
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,180
Oh.

550
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,020
Whoa.

551
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,640
Wait.

552
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,400
Where do I go from, though?

553
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,320
My whole...

554
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,360
I think.

555
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,620
Let's try it like this.

556
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,980
Oh, maybe that was overkill even.

557
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,340
Oh, I opened up there.

558
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,400
Do a flip!

559
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:20,760
Okay.

560
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,360
Weeeee...

561
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,410
The Google Translated version.

562
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,070
What's up?

563
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,750
So true, GLaDOS.

564
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,520
I love the turrets in this game.

565
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,400
I don't love the turrets, but I love how they sound.

566
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,680
I think they're so cute.

567
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,500
I love the way they talk.

568
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,780
They're so stinking cute.

569
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,060
Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, very long time.

570
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,380
If you become lightheaded from thirst, feel free to pass out.

571
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:13,760
Okay.

572
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,420
An intubation associate will be dispatched.

573
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,800
to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline.

574
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,460
Cool.

575
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,780
I want that.

576
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,300
Isn't it like...

577
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,460
I can't get over how freaky it is like watching my body go into the portal.

578
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,420
I know it's basically...

579
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,920
Oh wait.

580
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,400
I tried to shoot.

581
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,740
Certain objects may be vital to your success.

582
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,760
Do not destroy.

583
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,480
Sorry!

584
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,440
Okay, let's see what we got going on in here, huh?

585
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,720
Okay.

586
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,000
Do I need you?

587
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,360
There's two of them.

588
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,040
There's only one thing here, though.

589
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,720
Do I need both of them?

590
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,040
If I pick you up...

591
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,580
Ah, okay, no matter.

592
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,780
Oh wait, unless...

593
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,560
I shoot like a portal in here.

594
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:23,760
Yeah.

595
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,110
Just do that.

596
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,200
Okay.

597
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:30,640
That's one.

598
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,460
Um.

599
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,500
You need to go into...

600
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:36,880
There.

601
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,250
Now you're thinking with portals.

602
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,960
The music is so...

603
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,540
Freaky.

604
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:52,680
Okay.

605
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
And then...

606
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,800
So sorry, so sorry.

607
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,300
It was a mistake, a mistake.

608
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,940
My mistake, my mistakes.

609
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,640
Oh, my God.

610
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,160
How do I know?

611
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,600
I'm going in!

612
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,100
I'm going in!

613
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:16,960
Oh, I see.

614
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,920
I see.

615
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,600
I see where it wants me to drop it.

616
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:21,920
Okay.

617
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,620
Wood.

618
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,280
Go, my cube.

619
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,240
Oh, try again.

620
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:30,760
Oh!

621
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,240
Let's go.

622
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,460
Go, you guys.

623
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,860
You know the cube car?

624
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,220
A long time ago, I used to...

625
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:49,320
I was like, I'm going to have my first car be the cube car, and then I'm going to make it into a companion cube Itasha.

626
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:50,840
Trick shot!

627
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,900
Hey, if it works, it works.

628
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,520
How do I get up there?

629
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,460
Oh, do I have to go speedy?

630
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,360
Speedy?

631
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,140
Wait, speedy?

632
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,520
Oh, no.

633
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,760
I could just do this.

634
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,260
Easy.

635
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:17,200
As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you.

636
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,560
When the testing is over, you will be missed.

637
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,630
Wait, what do you mean by that?

638
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,440
Minto Whistle, have you ever played Pokemon Mystery Dungeon?

639
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,960
I actually have not played Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

640
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,820
Minto.

641
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,040
I will be missed?

642
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,860
I'm gonna get vaporized?

643
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,300
Whoa, there's like a...

644
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,120
Why won't they let me drink?

645
00:46:53,330 --> 00:47:12,450
All Sochic's intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they may be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues no hydration no further compliance information is required or will be provided and you are an excellent test subject

646
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:27,040
wait but i guess maybe can i fly from here from here Wee!

647
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,040
Easy?

648
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,300
What's that sound?

649
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,680
Oh, staircase, okay.

650
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,280
I believe I can fly.

651
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,920
Mint is smart?

652
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,980
I don't call myself a genius for no reason.

653
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,880
I definitely have reason to say so.

654
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,320
That's no good.

655
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,720
That's quite bad.

656
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,220
That's quite terrible.

657
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,340
Where are you?

658
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,400
Guys, my bad.

659
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,640
Wait a second.

660
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,480
But now that I know...

661
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,360
Aiming God.

662
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:35,840
Okay.

663
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,710
That might have happened on purpose.

664
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,690
I was just speedrunning.

665
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:50,750
I was speedrunning.

666
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:51,550
I was speedrunning.

667
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,630
Wait, which one?

668
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,350
I did orange.

669
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:01,250
Okay.

670
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,750
Very, very good.

671
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:09,930
A complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber.

672
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,170
A victory lift?

673
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,350
I'm going on, I'm doing a victory lift!

674
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,270
Guys were almost done with the tests.

675
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,030
They should just tire me forever.

676
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,850
They should be like, we don't need any other employee ever, ever, ever.

677
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,630
As long as we got this girl.

678
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:33,750
She's too good.

679
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,110
Can you do the classic trick where you put portal?

680
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,990
Oh yeah, I wanted to do that before when I had...

681
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,770
Only the blue and then I forgot.

682
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,870
Yeah, we'll go in the eternal loop.

683
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,850
The eternal loop!

684
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:51,870
There we go.

685
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:56,110
The enrichment center is committed to the well-being of all participants.

686
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:01,030
Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.

687
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,330
Thank you for helping us help you help us all.

688
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,010
It's a little messed up.

689
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,590
It needs a little, it needs some slight adjusting.

690
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,550
Wait, maybe like...

691
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,490
Oh, oops.

692
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,290
Wait.

693
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,730
Hold on.

694
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,110
Okay, here.

695
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:26,790
Oops, oops, okay.

696
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,130
And then...

697
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,470
Here.

698
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,070
We're reaching levels never reached before!

699
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:39,290
Ah!

700
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:42,970
Oh my god, toes!

701
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,730
Gamers don't look up, but they should!

702
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:55,830
That was fun.

703
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,090
Vital testing apparatus destroy.

704
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,490
Um...

705
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,890
How do I...

706
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,370
If I...

707
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,370
Let's see how far I get.

708
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:19,930
Not far enough.

709
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,050
If I run...

710
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,550
It was even worse.

711
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:29,210
Let's see.

712
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,660
Do I need to do the momentum thing and then be really good?

713
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,220
And like aim?

714
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,980
Oh my god.

715
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,800
Oh, shoot.

716
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,780
Wait.

717
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,380
Ah!

718
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,600
Oh, I messed it up.

719
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,240
Wait, hold on.

720
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,500
Okay, hold on.

721
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,580
If this is orange, I need to shoot blue.

722
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,180
Okay.

723
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,480
Oh, okay.

724
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,440
Ah, wait.

725
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,020
Of course that didn't work.

726
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,500
Okay, hold on.

727
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,100
This is a difficult way to do this.

728
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,860
Am I overthinking?

729
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,070
I'm overcomplicating it.

730
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,140
There are easier ways!

731
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,680
You guys know me, I overcomplicate things all the time.

732
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,040
Wait, how am I...

733
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,340
Wait, hold on, I want to reset it.

734
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,220
Oh wait, hold on.

735
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,240
Oh wait, hold on.

736
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,780
I think I get... I think I know what to do.

737
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,100
Yeah!

738
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,800
I figured it out.

739
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,600
I figured it out!

740
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,400
Don't worry!

741
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,520
If I go through here...

742
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:13,960
Oh, it does.

743
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,760
Okay, interesting.

744
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,170
Oh, now you won't let me, huh?

745
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,130
Oh.

746
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:29,270
Oh!

747
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:36,890
Oops.

748
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:39,410
Oh.

749
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,070
Come on.

750
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,320
Whoa.

751
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,160
And then obviously you cannot...

752
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,240
Hmm.

753
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,800
This one's tricky.

754
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,860
I'm taking a second to explore.

755
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:14,100
In high school, I engraved Chell, the player character, onto a friend's water bottle in the energy lab.

756
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,180
What's that?

757
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,200
I always forgot how to do this one.

758
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,240
I'm trying to...

759
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,520
Because if you go through...

760
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,380
I think you have to...

761
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:35,560
Okay.

762
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,800
And you have to be fast because it eventually gets destroyed.

763
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,440
I kind of think I have to do what I did before.

764
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,860
Like this.

765
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,260
And then once it's in there...

766
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,500
Oh wait, what?

767
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,760
Oh wait.

768
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,720
Uh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, I was too slow.

769
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,720
Oh, but this gets destroyed, no.

770
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,000
When I pass through, like, if I, yeah.

771
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,200
Uh, oh, you gotta be super fast.

772
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:06,760
Okay, okay.

773
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,640
Hold on, I'll wait for it to get destroyed.

774
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,540
Okay.

775
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,680
And then, uh, this, this one.

776
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,360
Wait, did I already mess it up?

777
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:26,640
Oh!

778
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,220
Dang it.

779
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,840
Wait, oh I even did the wrong one!

780
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,960
Okay, oh geez.

781
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:33,480
Oh.

782
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,040
Okay, hold on.

783
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,540
Ow!

784
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,160
Wait, wait, wait, go, go, go, go!

785
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,460
Yippee!

786
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,100
Okay.

787
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,380
Did you just Tim Allen Grunt on accident?

788
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,060
Who is that?

789
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,880
Dang it.

790
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,100
Is that the

791
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:11,110
Who is that?

792
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:15,530
Oops.

793
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:16,250
Wait.

794
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:17,190
Oh, geez.

795
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:18,310
Let me up.

796
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,230
Copies.

797
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,410
Let me up.

798
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,050
If you're not seeing home improvement, mm-hmm.

799
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,290
Oh, I can't get through here.

800
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,350
That's so silly.

801
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:29,790
Ah!

802
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:30,670
Okay.

803
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,470
Toy Story.

804
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,490
He's a Buzz Lightyear!

805
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,350
Oh.

806
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,030
Oh, whoops.

807
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,190
I messed up.

808
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:42,770
No

809
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,020
way.

810
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,540
Does I have to do it like before?

811
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,390
Okay, wait.

812
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,450
Okay, so I need to shoot another orange.

813
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:01,990
Oh.

814
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,610
Ah, I'm taking.

815
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:05,190
Wait.

816
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,930
Yeah, I need more momentum.

817
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,610
Shoot orange!

818
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:13,510
Oh.

819
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,770
It doesn't help when I'm getting topsy-turvy.

820
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:33,770
first okay yeah imagine if I had hit that if I had hit the thing

821
00:57:45,630 --> 00:58:07,600
where can I get momentum from I guess I have to create it all on my own it's I gotta shoot I gotta shoot orange, or blue.

822
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,660
Then, we...

823
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:16,980
Oops.

824
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,200
My bad.

825
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,240
Do it again.

826
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,960
Do it again.

827
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,840
Do it again.

828
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,380
Do it again.

829
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,200
Oh.

830
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,500
Good enough?

831
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,540
No, not good enough.

832
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:30,860
Wait.

833
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,520
Wait.

834
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,750
Oops, wait, okay.

835
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,810
Home improvement ended in the 90s.

836
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,420
Progress in making.

837
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,460
Okay, hold on.

838
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,590
Did I make it?

839
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,490
Oh, yeah!

840
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,740
How do I get back home?

841
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,160
Oh, wait.

842
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,040
Um...

843
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:16,620
Hmm.

844
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,580
Somehow I lucked out with that, but I don't know how to get back home.

845
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,460
Wasn't the intended solution, but it works.

846
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,960
Let's go.

847
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,420
If there's a wheel, there's a way.

848
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,140
Um, I do orange.

849
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:35,940
Okay, orange.

850
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:37,460
No, blue.

851
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,100
Gosh.

852
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,320
Oh, so close.

853
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,420
Okay!

854
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,380
Alright.

855
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,620
My ride is here.

856
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,880
My very slow ride.

857
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,280
Oh, wait, what's happening?

858
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,660
Wait, wait, you can't do that.

859
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:03,900
Oh no!

860
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:04,900
Wait a second!

861
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,680
Oh no, it's like a revolving sushi!

862
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,220
Eh?

863
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,500
Okay.

864
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,940
You are the sushi.

865
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:31,630
Oh my gosh.

866
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,270
Oh, death.

867
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:34,850
Death is imminent.

868
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:35,570
Please.

869
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:38,670
Okay, good, good, good, good.

870
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,670
The game, the game has, like, good save points.

871
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,690
Good checkpoints.

872
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:43,930
You know?

873
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:45,390
Oh, oops.

874
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,330
That was the wrong one.

875
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,270
Oh, where am I?

876
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:48,790
Uh.

877
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,510
Oh, I'm supposed to go the other way.

878
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,130
My bad.

879
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,550
I got a little lost.

880
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,700
We made it through to that place.

881
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,560
Yeah, indeed.

882
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,340
Don't forget the quicksit.

883
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,580
Wait, is it...

884
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,120
I'm gonna save, but... Is it F5?

885
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,580
Nothing is happening if I I'm gonna save my...

886
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,700
What does this do?

887
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,500
Oh, okay, okay.

888
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:44,270
Oh.

889
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:47,310
Did it open?

890
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:49,450
Oh, where are you going?

891
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:51,150
There's

892
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,320
more than one!

893
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,800
Oh, there's two doors!

894
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,180
Oh my golly.

895
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,020
Okay.

896
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,400
Okay.

897
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,180
Okay, so I have to be in there.

898
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:24,800
Okay, hold on.

899
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,350
I'm trying to get the timing.

900
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,710
Just think with portals.

901
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:37,470
I know, I know I have to, like, portal here and here, but this needs to also...

902
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,170
Okay, hold on.

903
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:39,690
Wait, don't come in here.

904
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,490
Sorry, it scared me.

905
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:45,830
Okay, go away, go away,

906
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,410
Go away, go away.

907
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:52,930
Destroy!

908
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:53,990
Go!

909
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,630
Go!

910
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:58,170
Go!

911
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:01,070
Go!

912
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:01,150
Go!

913
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,170
Go!

914
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:03,340
Go!

915
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,500
Why doesn't this one explode?

916
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,230
Oh, now I trapped it in here.

917
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:13,410
With me.

918
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:14,330
Okay.

919
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:16,830
All right.

920
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:21,990
Okay, now it's just kind of wandering on its own.

921
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,530
It's doing its own.

922
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:24,190
Oh, no.

923
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:31,570
Okay, alrighty, alrighty.

924
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,230
How long does it last for?

925
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:02,860
Okay.

926
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,220
Alright.

927
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,560
Please.

928
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:16,820
Did I make it?

929
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,800
Oh, where is it?

930
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,700
How'd you get in here?

931
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:32,440
Arm, he's right behind me, isn't he?

932
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:44,970
Place the top one first.

933
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:45,550
Like this?

934
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,050
Oh, I guess that makes sense, right?

935
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:49,550
Okay, okay.

937
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

938
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,190
I got you, I got you.

939
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:00,350
Oh!

940
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,710
Did you know?

941
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:08,110
You can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science Self-Esteem Fund for girls.

942
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:08,970
It's true.

943
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,850
The girls need the organs.

944
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,190
I've always wished for five kidneys.

945
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,930
Um, he's right behind me, isn't he?

946
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:26,590
That would make my self-esteem go up so much if I had more kidneys.

947
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:29,990
Only five?

948
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:33,010
I'm not trying to be, like, so greedy.

949
01:05:34,150 --> 01:06:00,150
that need kidneys and I need five due to mandatory scheduled maintenance the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable it has been replaced with a live fire course designed for military androids the enrichment center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck it's time for turrets

950
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,980
So cute.

951
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,520
Oh, oh my gosh.

952
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,500
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.

953
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,760
There you are.

954
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,500
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.

955
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:36,370
Wait.

956
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,450
Okay, no, it's not gonna be able to see me.

957
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:39,710
Oh, you can't see me.

958
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:40,190
Freaky.

959
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,170
I hear the radio!

960
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,380
Where is he?

961
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:52,640
Oh.

962
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:54,900
Scary.

963
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,540
Go meet her.

964
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,380
Wait, um...

965
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,700
I need to do like a...

966
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,400
up there.

967
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,140
And then...

968
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,520
Hold on.

969
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:15,340
Ah!

970
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:15,720
Stay!

971
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,800
Don't spook me, don't spook me.

972
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:28,540
You can have my kidneys, liver, lungs, whatever you need.

973
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,820
Let you take my heart, but it already...

974
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,760
Oh my gosh, break.

975
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,000
Activated.

976
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,960
Are you still there?

977
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,920
Oh my god, they're so cute sounding, though, no?

978
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,180
Are you still there?

979
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:50,760
Searching.

980
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,520
Um.

981
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:56,460
Nap time.

982
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:56,940
Nap time.

983
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,160
Searching.

984
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:00,660
Oh wait.

985
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,060
I think I did the wrong one.

986
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:02,380
There we go.

987
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,620
Activated.

988
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,580
Are you still there?

989
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,000
Can't I like grab it?

990
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,380
Hi, Bernadine.

991
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,060
Hey.

992
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,260
Oh.

993
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,720
Don't hate you.

994
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,260
Wait, how do I throw again?

995
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,560
Can I throw?

996
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,460
Can I not throw these guys?

997
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,460
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.

998
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,480
I don't eat you.

999
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,340
Momentum.

1000
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:41,800
What does this say?

1001
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,200
It says help.

1002
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,600
Uh oh, is this where it starts getting kind of crazy?

1003
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:53,460
Oh!

1004
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:58,180
Is this where it starts getting a little spooky?

1005
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,340
I'm trying to crouch.

1006
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,100
I'm trying to.

1007
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,280
But I can't get in, I'm still too fat.

1008
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,860
Wait, I'm still too fat.

1009
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,060
Oh, here we go.

1010
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,280
The cake is a lie!

1011
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,900
The cake is a lie, the cake is a lie, the cake is a lie.

1012
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,400
It's still so exciting.

1013
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,900
Seeing all this.

1014
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:35,860
You know?

1015
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,640
Why can't I throw these things, but I can't throw the turrets?

1016
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:54,740
too hefty they said the thing i like how it looks like it's written in crayon hello can i help you i wonder

1017
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:05,120
a trusted friend in science

1018
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,160
so cool Yo.

1019
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:20,560
Yo.

1020
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:21,720
Yo.

1021
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:21,780
Yo.

1022
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,880
You can throw turrets.

1023
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,500
I tried.

1024
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,150
Are you still there?

1025
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:40,870
Oh, this one's tricky though because there's two of them.

1026
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:41,450
Hmm.

1027
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:48,610
Who's there?

1028
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,970
Not me.

1029
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,370
Mouse won while holding turrets.

1030
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,150
That's what I tried.

1031
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,290
The handprint.

1032
01:10:56,570 --> 01:11:00,990
I remember seeing a Half-Life 2 mod back in the day that added the portal gun to Freeman's arsenal.

1033
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:02,670
Oh, that does sound fun.

1034
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,090
Cube has a shield!

1035
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,170
You're so smart!

1036
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:11,870
Are you still there?

1037
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,370
There you are.

1038
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:13,730
Woo!

1039
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:15,890
Creepy.

1040
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,630
Quit.

1041
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:21,290
Throw!

1042
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:21,890
Oh.

1043
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,470
Okay.

1044
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,070
Wait, I wonder...

1045
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:39,010
You're gonna trust some random scribbles on a wall or GLaDOS?

1046
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,410
Yeah, GLaDOS is so pretty.

1047
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:44,470
Oh.

1048
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,980
I was close enough.

1049
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,320
Okay, hold on.

1050
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:56,560
No deploying, no deploying, no deploying.

1051
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,320
Oh

1052
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,440
my gosh.

1053
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,200
I almost died.

1054
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,740
Oh my gosh.

1055
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:26,100
I wonder what my health is anyway.

1056
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,480
I don't know.

1057
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:39,450
It regens?

1058
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:41,130
Okay, I'm going to save just in case.

1059
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:01,350
Look at all these tools and stuff.

1060
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,890
Oh.

1061
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,020
It regens really fast.

1062
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:22,960
No, my companion cube is full of bullet holes.

1063
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:30,110
Deploy.

1064
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,590
Who's searching?

1065
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,090
Nah, nothing there.

1066
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:39,250
Nothing here.

1067
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:41,770
Did that get it?

1068
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,210
We have a couple tries.

1069
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,370
We have a couple tries here, no?

1070
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:48,510
Bounce!

1071
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,180
Maybe.

1072
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:02,920
Proves the cubes are stronger than high-tech turrets.

1073
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:03,760
Wait.

1074
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:10,420
What are you gonna do?

1075
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,220
What are you gonna do?

1076
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,820
Who's there?

1077
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:26,240
Shutting down.

1078
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,000
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.

1079
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:47,860
Ah.

1080
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:58,900
Okay.

1081
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:00,760
Hmm.

1082
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:01,660
Hmm.

1083
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,040
Hmm.

1084
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,600
Uh.

1085
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:12,860
Ow!

1086
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:13,280
Ow!

1087
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,060
That scared me.

1088
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:15,740
Ah!

1089
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,840
They just flick the bullet.

1090
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,840
I attack you aggressively.

1091
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,730
I want to see...

1092
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:27,210
Let's see.

1093
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:34,790
If I do this, maybe...

1094
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,310
Ouch!

1095
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,090
How did you get me though?

1096
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:44,570
How?

1097
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:46,590
How?

1098
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,430
My poor Compendium.

1099
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,030
My poor Compendium Cube.

1100
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,430
Wait, I can't bring you with me!

1101
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,130
Well done, Android.

1102
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:08,370
The enrichment center once again reminds you that Android Hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.

1103
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:11,110
Android Hell, don't threaten me with a good time.

1104
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,390
You would have been given the cake by now if you didn't keep destroying the camera.

1105
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:16,890
That's not true at all.

1106
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,950
They love an open mind.

1107
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,810
Oh, look at this.

1108
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:25,210
They knew.

1109
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,430
They were like, we won't let you destroy this one.

1110
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:34,650
The Vitala Horetus Vent will deliver a weighted companion cube in 3, 2, 1.

1111
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,010
I like the colors.

1112
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:42,950
No turrets!

1113
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:46,730
This weighted companion cube will accompany you through the test chamber.

1114
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,570
Please take care of it.

1115
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:49,110
Okay.

1116
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,350
Wait, this one is actually a companion cube.

1117
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:53,810
It's got, like, the heart on it.

1118
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:56,790
We actually have a companion cube.

1119
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,270
Come, come, come, come.

1120
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:02,470
Come, my sweet.

1121
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,010
Ah!

1122
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:06,470
Oh, okay.

1123
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,850
Um...

1124
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:11,810
Okay, one moment, please.

1125
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:14,530
Where does...

1126
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:15,590
Where do they go?

1127
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,230
Where to?

1128
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:19,610
Okay, hold on.

1129
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:20,190
I'm running.

1130
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:21,650
I might die.

1131
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,890
I might die, companion cube.

1132
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,730
Don't forget about me.

1133
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:28,970
I think I need to bring the companion cube.

1134
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:43,210
The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.

1135
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:52,190
The Enrichment Center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

1136
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:52,990
Good.

1137
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,950
I would love a little threat.

1138
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:59,070
But you know...

1139
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:00,410
Oh, oh!

1140
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:04,920
I thought it was behind me.

1141
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,300
Um...

1142
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:15,560
The enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

1143
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,920
Okay, will I make it?

1144
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I think I'm messed up!

1145
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,900
I think I'm messed up!

1146
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,580
We're fine.

1147
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,880
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.

1148
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,200
Wait.

1149
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:50,480
Did it hit it?

1150
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,200
Oh, wait.

1151
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,100
Oh, shoot.

1152
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,660
Okay, I need you to come through, please.

1153
01:18:58,940 --> 01:18:59,620
Come through, please.

1154
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,660
Oh, I was too slow.

1155
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,920
And then...

1156
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,640
Yeah.

1157
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,740
What did that open?

1158
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,160
Oh, this...

1159
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:12,680
One.

1160
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,840
Okay.

1161
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:24,870
I'm like hearing something just bouncing all around.

1162
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:26,890
One out of three, yeah.

1163
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,300
Alrighty.

1164
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:36,840
Okie dokie.

1165
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,660
That should be good enough.

1166
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,260
Okay, so blue, blue.

1167
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:50,400
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

1168
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:51,620
Oh, wait.

1169
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,440
Oh my gosh.

1170
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:53,100
Ah!

1171
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:05,570
No!

1172
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:07,090
Wait.

1173
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,150
Did it activate it?

1174
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:12,350
Oh, okay, good.

1175
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:13,050
Okay, good.

1176
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:18,370
How did she manage to get right in its direction?

1177
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,510
I don't know.

1178
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,910
I have no idea.

1179
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:25,270
It was kind of crazy.

1180
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:27,930
It might be a genius or something.

1181
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,330
We're just gonna do that for now.

1182
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,130
So that doesn't happen again?

1183
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:41,030
Alrighty.

1184
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:43,170
Okay.

1185
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,260
Come on through.

1186
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,160
Come on through.

1187
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,300
Come on through.

1188
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:54,780
Oh.

1189
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:55,560
Oh,

1190
01:20:59,540 --> 01:20:59,740
shoot.

1191
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,120
Dang it.

1192
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:14,510
The crosshairs tell you what color you shot last.

1193
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:14,990
Really?

1194
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,350
I had it before.

1195
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:23,490
I was trying to line it up because I thought I didn't have it lined up the first time.

1196
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,810
The crosshairs aren't telling me anything.

1197
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:29,130
Oh, you mean the blue on the side.

1198
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,930
Oh, I see it.

1199
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:30,230
Okay.

1200
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,000
Where did you go?

1201
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,480
Um.

1202
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:47,360
Oh, wait.

1203
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:48,660
Oh, dang it.

1204
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,140
Okay.

1205
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,280
Bounce.

1206
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:54,160
And then...

1207
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:58,680
Oh.

1208
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,260
Shoot.

1209
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,320
There we go.

1210
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,400
Oh, wait!

1211
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,440
Oh, my gosh.

1212
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,500
I...

1213
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,960
Guys, I'm so dumb.

1214
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:07,980
Because...

1215
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,600
I was getting that one a second.

1216
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:43,210
time that's oh my gosh oh okay so sorry i'm i'm so sorry oops oh that's embarrassing wait how do i get back up there oh that's why i was like wait i okay ignore me okay we're fine oh do you need wait i I lost my companion key.

1217
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,130
What's going on in here?

1218
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,520
Wait, let me in!

1219
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,940
Double solved it.

1220
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:01,770
Stop watching.

1221
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,650
No, don't stop watching.

1222
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,130
Keep watching.

1223
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:07,870
Oh, I can portal in.

1224
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:08,390
You're so right.

1225
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,050
She's watching you.

1226
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:13,270
No, I destroy those.

1227
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:21,060
That's my companion cube.

1228
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,760
The girls of Aperture Science.

1229
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,140
Now, thank you so much for the 20th and thank you.

1230
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,560
Not never, but now.

1231
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,360
Companion cube.

1232
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,480
You said to take care of it.

1233
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,940
How can you...

1234
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:44,100
Wouldn't...

1235
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:44,940
Disintegrate.

1236
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,920
I should disintegrate your advice.

1237
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:48,740
Leave me alone.

1238
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:49,560
Stop watching.

1239
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:54,780
Though Earth and man are gone.

1240
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,000
I thought the cube would last forever.

1241
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,120
I was wrong.

1242
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,080
Why?

1243
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:01,400
Why?

1244
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:01,740
Why?

1245
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:01,860
Why?

1246
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:01,960
Why?

1247
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:02,140
Why?

1248
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:02,220
Why?

1249
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:02,400
Why?

1250
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:02,420
Why?

1251
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:02,540
Why?

1252
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:02,700
Why?

1253
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:02,700
Why?

1254
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,640
Oh my gosh.

1255
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,640
Her little companion cube family.

1256
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,820
Not in cruelty.

1257
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:11,920
Not in wrath.

1258
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,360
The Reaper came today.

1259
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,920
An angel visited this gray path and took the cube.

1260
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,740
away.

1261
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:20,860
Oh, it's so sad.

1262
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,740
Damn, they'd be in the beans.

1263
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,080
Tasty.

1264
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,580
But what about the beans?

1265
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:34,440
What is...

1266
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,700
Oh, these are the cameras.

1267
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:36,200
Oh.

1268
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,240
This one is a little harder to read, I think.

1269
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:40,820
Login.

1270
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,480
C.

1271
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,240
Johnson.

1272
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,140
Tier 3.

1273
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,360
Trust me.

1274
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,920
Cake is a lie.

1275
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,560
Haha, the companion cube would never lie to me.

1276
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,060
Never.

1277
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,250
Where are you?

1278
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:05,030
Will find you.

1279
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:08,310
Tier 3 sub.

1280
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,550
Thanks for the tier 3 sub.

1281
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,660
Very cool.

1282
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,100
I forgot, I could think with portals.

1283
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:27,680
Okay.

1284
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,100
Okay, come back.

1285
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,360
Bonk!

1286
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,100
Bonk, bonk!

1287
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:42,340
The Enrichment Center reminds you that the weighted companion cube cannot speak.

1288
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:50,140
In the event that the weighted companion cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.

1289
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,060
What's he saying, though?

1290
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,100
So there's still one more...

1291
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:03,960
That...

1292
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,100
Oh, this camera too.

1293
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,440
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.

1294
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:08,520
Sorry.

1295
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,880
Sorry, suckers.

1296
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,640
What does this do?

1297
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:16,830
Oh.

1298
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,310
Oh, cool.

1299
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:21,210
Ah!

1300
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:24,930
I see.

1301
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:27,930
The cube.

1302
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:30,990
The cube is telling me all sorts of really fun things.

1303
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,380
Oh, I need another cube though, no?

1304
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,920
Was it another one?

1305
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,780
It's saying Minto is cute.

1306
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,080
The cube thinks Minto cuto.

1307
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:07,730
You can trap it between doors.

1308
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:09,650
Oh, that's true.

1309
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:12,590
I wonder where it's going.

1310
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,640
You don't want to know what the cube says.

1311
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,720
The cube has a nice figure.

1312
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,900
I do want to know...

1313
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,720
what the cube is saying.

1314
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:37,770
Okay.

1315
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:39,930
Oh!

1316
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:41,070
Uh-oh.

1317
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:41,970
Uh, guys?

1318
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:42,730
Oh god.

1319
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:43,150
Wait.

1320
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:45,530
Maybe that worked.

1321
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:46,010
Oh no!

1322
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:46,610
It didn't work!

1323
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:48,630
Okay.

1324
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:10,730
Okay.

1325
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:11,690
Alright.

1326
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:14,830
Ow!

1327
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,960
Wait, how do I get you up there?

1328
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:19,420
Alright.

1329
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:20,760
Put you in?

1330
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,020
Alright, hold on.

1331
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,500
Come, come, come, come.

1332
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,200
We're waiting?

1333
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:32,000
We're waiting?

1334
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,740
Okay, come cube.

1335
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:47,010
Come, my cube.

1336
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:49,310
My sweet.

1337
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:50,530
My precious.

1338
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:53,910
I'm becoming cube-smeagle over here.

1339
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,350
Yes, my cube.

1340
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:01,770
My lovely cube.

1341
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:03,590
My companion.

1342
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:04,630
Ah!

1343
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:05,370
Sorry.

1344
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:06,810
I thought I lost her.

1345
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:08,130
Okay, just kidding.

1346
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:08,850
One more time.

1347
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:13,510
Doesn't she just look so cute with the heart?

1348
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,530
The exit is this way.

1349
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:26,210
You did it.

1350
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:30,170
The weighted companion cube certainly brought you good luck.

1351
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:37,130
However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.

1352
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:44,010
Please escort your companion cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.

1353
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,980
We even time you.

1354
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:54,880
Bye!

1355
01:29:55,620 --> 01:30:00,940
You euthanized your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record.

1356
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,100
Congratulations.

1357
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,900
Take me instead!

1358
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,520
I got an achievement for it.

1359
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:09,560
You think she's in there?

1360
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:12,180
Cube?

1361
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,760
Cube, can you hear me?

1362
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,400
Boy, boy, cube!

1363
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:19,420
The caked up cube will be missed.

1364
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,380
The companion cube loves me!

1365
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,140
She would know I had to do it!

1366
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,960
That was cold.

1367
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:31,380
Look.

1368
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,700
If I kill the companion cube, the companion cube will be with me in the afterlife.

1369
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,560
That's how it works.

1370
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,260
I'm a ghost.

1371
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:40,700
The experiment is nearing its conclusion.

1372
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:45,900
The enrichment center is required to remind you that you will be baked.

1373
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,580
And then there will be cake.

1374
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,340
Yeah!

1375
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,280
There will be cake!

1376
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,880
Let them eat it!

1377
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,160
Let them eat it!

1378
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:04,650
What's this way?

1379
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:10,060
Is that a turret?

1380
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,620
Oh, no.

1381
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,560
That's a radio, but it's not playing anything.

1382
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,040
What's that?

1383
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:30,740
Oh, no cake.

1384
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,120
She's watching you.

1385
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,360
Courage is not the absence of fear.

1386
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:50,340
When I'm figuring out how to...

1387
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,060
to take apart the establishment.

1388
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,870
I also like to listen to that song.

1389
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,500
Nothing here.

1390
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,680
Nothing here.

1391
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:22,690
Wait, why not?

1392
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,850
I must trust.

1393
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:31,370
I must trust.

1394
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:37,570
I almost didn't trust.

1395
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:41,730
That was too scary.

1396
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:44,310
Where am I supposed to go from here?

1397
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,290
Wait, where did I come from?

1398
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:49,090
Wait, did I...

1399
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:50,970
Uh, wait, where did I come from?

1400
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:52,230
Oh, wait.

1401
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,210
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fine, we're fine.

1402
01:32:59,130 --> 01:32:59,450
.

1403
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:02,870
.

1404
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:03,070
.

1405
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:03,170
.

1406
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:03,270
.

1407
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:03,510
.

1408
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,960
Wait a second.

1409
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:18,960
Did I mess up?

1410
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,380
Where does this go?

1411
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,200
Okay.

1412
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,800
Oh, I think I see.

1413
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,300
This one, maybe?

1414
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,000
Ah!

1415
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:47,100
Do you see it?

1416
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:49,480
You're gonna have to jump the gap.

1417
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:50,860
I am?

1418
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,740
Let's see what.

1419
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,260
Am I supposed to be a gamer?

1420
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,650
That was close.

1421
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:09,510
Okay.

1422
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:11,070
Maybe this one instead.

1423
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:15,720
Okay.

1424
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:19,820
Okay.

1425
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,980
Like so.

1426
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:36,640
Yeah.

1427
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:38,920
Oh no!

1428
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,840
Oh, I forgot there's turrets here!

1429
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:49,050
Oh my gosh, wait.

1430
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:51,430
But they're gonna kill me.

1431
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,070
They're gonna kill me.

1432
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,910
Okay, this lasts a pretty long time though.

1433
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:04,200
Are you still there?

1434
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,640
Darket lost.

1435
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,880
Let's see.

1436
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:29,560
Hey guys, uh, try not to spam, you know, I appreciate hints and all, but try not to do so much until I, um, until I've, like, at least even looked at the puzzle a little bit, okay?

1437
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:31,840
Thank you, though.

1438
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:50,590
I barely got into the room, so let me, like, just kind of look around and see what we got going on first before I, before we, uh, you know.

1439
01:35:53,110 --> 01:36:13,110
before I ask for help before I ask for help thank you okay so that's the door so I'm guessing this opens this which activates that oh okay

1440
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:37,760
I missed all the hints did everyone say to open the console a noclip directly into the cake no you open the console and you actually put the slice of cake into your console and it will change Gladys's mind.

1441
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:46,840
Gladys has taste buds in the console and she'll say, wow, delicious.

1442
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,120
Let's see, okay.

1443
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,980
How do without getting shot?

1444
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:59,460
Can I kill the target?

1445
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,540
Wait, I think that... did that?

1446
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,100
No, no searching, no searching.

1447
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:10,440
Can you kill the turrets with the ball?

1448
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:19,340
Ah!

1449
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,420
Yes, you can!

1450
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:24,460
Okay, so that's one down.

1451
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:27,940
And...

1452
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:29,020
Maybe like here?

1453
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:30,960
Maybe.

1454
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:34,880
Oh, shoot.

1455
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:36,860
Oh.

1456
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:39,940
Wait, you're gonna launch here.

1457
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:43,880
Too high.

1458
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,580
Wait, activated.

1459
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:48,320
Who, where, why?

1460
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:50,620
Die.

1461
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:51,220
Dang it.

1462
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:52,080
I was wrong.

1463
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,200
Hold on.

1464
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,880
Hint portals.

1465
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:02,040
You're so right.

1466
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,480
Oh, oh, yeah!

1467
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,480
Okay, that's another one down.

1468
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,780
Okay, we're getting there.

1469
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,420
I will have a face.

1470
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,880
A safe...

1471
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,140
E!

1472
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,940
Just use your gravity gun, so true.

1473
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:31,960
Was that one?

1474
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:33,800
Will that hit?

1475
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:36,080
First try?

1476
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:36,580
Oh!

1477
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:39,260
Oh, I'm too good!

1478
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,160
Oh wait.

1479
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:46,680
Which is about to hit?

1480
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:48,280
It's about to go to this one, right?

1481
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:57,030
Okay, alrighty, alrighty.

1482
01:38:58,190 --> 01:39:03,330
Now, I can properly try things.

1483
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,310
But what do I try?

1484
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,430
Wait a second, what do I try?

1485
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:19,810
It was my birthday today!

1486
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:22,650
I was wondering if I could get an MGS birthday song.

1487
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:24,750
Happy birthday.

1488
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:26,750
Congratulations.

1489
01:39:27,610 --> 01:39:30,770
Happy birthday with salutations.

1490
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:33,010
Happy birthday.

1491
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:36,170
May your sky stay blue.

1492
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:41,450
Happy birthday to you.

1493
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:42,150
I go symphony.

1494
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:42,810
Happy birthday.

1495
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:46,130
Happy, happy.

1496
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:55,330
Oh!

1497
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:56,810
Okay, okay, okay.

1498
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:57,450
Oh, shoot.

1499
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:04,380
Wait, did I...

1500
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,580
I think I even missed.

1501
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,180
Okay, what I have to do is...

1502
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,420
Oh, oh, oh.

1503
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:12,740
Oh.

1504
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,540
Oh, it's this one, isn't it?

1505
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Is it this?

1506
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,500
Hold on, I'm checking.

1507
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:29,740
Yeah.

1508
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:30,400
Yeah.

1509
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:32,660
Oh, okay.

1510
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:36,220
Oh, that's tricky.

1511
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,820
Wait, that's kind of tricky.

1512
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,920
I have to do so much shooting and so much portaling.

1513
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,460
I have to do so much shooting and portaling!

1514
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,200
I think one of the longer ones would be easiest.

1515
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:01,800
Okay.

1516
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,480
So I'm gonna...

1517
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:04,720
Okay.

1518
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:06,860
Okay.

1519
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,940
Wait, I don't think it'll...

1520
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:17,740
Wait, oh, oh my gosh, wait, oh, wait, oh gosh, wait, I have to, okay, oh, okay, okay.

1521
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,740
Need three brains for this one.

1522
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,260
No, no, we don't, we got it.

1523
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:32,520
We got it?

1524
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,600
I mean, those cake is definitely not fake.

1525
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,940
Not at all.

1526
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,340
I go over here.

1527
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:48,260
Yes, please.

1528
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,420
Thank you.

1529
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,260
Actually, do I go down?

1530
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,200
I'm not quite sure.

1531
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,140
What did that do?

1532
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:08,800
What did that do?

1533
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:09,900
What did that do?

1534
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,540
What did it do?

1535
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:15,850
Oh my gosh, wait, there's...

1536
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:19,620
I have a thousand more today!

1537
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:20,180
We die!

1538
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:21,100
Happy birthday!

1539
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:25,810
I opened the wall, I came in.

1540
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:29,530
Oh, this!

1541
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,280
Am I stuck here?

1542
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,040
Oh no.

1543
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:51,100
I think I need to drop here.

1544
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:55,860
Okay.

1545
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,360
Wait, I'm stupid.

1546
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:05,060
Wait, uh, wait, I'm dumb.

1547
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:08,420
Hold on.

1548
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,500
I messed up.

1549
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:10,960
Yes, but no.

1550
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:13,580
Yes, but no.

1551
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:14,240
Okay, hold on.

1552
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:15,660
Okay.

1553
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:19,340
And I need blue.

1554
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:20,980
Wait, no?

1555
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:24,900
Oh, it moved it.

1556
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:29,820
Wait, don't don't don't go yet.

1557
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:30,460
Don't go yet.

1558
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,220
No!

1559
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:42,430
Okay.

1560
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:44,030
Okay, we're fine.

1561
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:47,310
It disables the portal when you...

1562
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:48,410
When you...

1563
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:49,510
When it starts moving.

1564
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:54,770
Yeah, the portal vanishes off moving surfaces.

1565
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:55,890
Yeah, I didn't realize.

1566
01:43:55,910 --> 01:44:01,130
that, so that is what got me a little bit.

1567
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:01,830
Okay.

1568
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:05,910
So, if I do this...

1569
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:26,780
So, what I'll need to do is click, go through portal portal.

1570
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,040
I

1571
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:41,410
did!

1572
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:44,170
Um...

1573
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,330
Can I jump onto this?

1574
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:48,970
I'm scared.

1575
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:49,990
Oh, I made it.

1576
01:44:50,730 --> 01:44:50,730
Okay.

1577
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:52,670
Yeah!

1578
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:54,110
Yeah!

1579
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:01,600
Wait, how do I...

1580
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,380
Oh, I need to do it again, don't I?

1581
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:09,720
Because I have to get behind the...

1582
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,440
Okay.

1583
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:12,880
Okay.

1584
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:18,650
Got it.

1585
01:45:18,690 --> 01:45:21,010
Wait, let's put the cube over here.

1586
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:23,310
Oh.

1587
01:45:23,410 --> 01:45:24,290
Don't leave, don't leave.

1588
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:25,430
Don't leave, my Uber.

1589
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:29,070
Okay.

1590
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:30,430
Don't forget to save.

1591
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:30,990
You're right.

1592
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:32,310
Just in case.

1593
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,000
Oh, oh my gosh.

1594
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,760
I was like, what was all that for?

1595
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:01,400
I couldn't even remember.

1596
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,480
Wait, is there...

1597
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:04,060
Anywhere?

1598
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:04,480
Okay.

1599
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,860
Graceful like a cat.

1600
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:10,100
No, no, no!

1601
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:10,820
No!

1602
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:31,200
No!

1603
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:32,140
Oh, okay, okay.

1604
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,500
We're fine!

1605
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,660
Everything's fine!

1606
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:42,600
We're fine!

1607
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:46,620
Everything's chill!

1608
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,120
Everything's fine!

1609
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:51,440
What's your guys' problem?

1610
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:52,180
What?

1611
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:01,180
Oh my gosh.

1612
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:04,160
Wait, this might be the leap of faith.

1613
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,660
Your mind is a beautiful enigma.

1614
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:11,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

1615
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,840
I got a blue!

1616
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:16,480
Oh, okay.

1617
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,030
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1618
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,960
Wait, where am I looking?

1619
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:32,900
Oh, no.

1620
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:34,780
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1621
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,020
Oh,

1622
01:47:45,730 --> 01:47:46,390
no.

1623
01:47:46,450 --> 01:47:47,990
Oh, I need more.

1624
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:49,510
More momentum!

1625
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:51,810
Ow!

1626
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:53,990
Ow!

1627
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:59,410
Get me out of this hellhole!

1628
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:03,190
Oh shoot!

1629
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:05,330
I did the wrong thing.

1630
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:09,350
You think I can make this?

1631
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:22,040
That was craziness.

1632
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:23,320
Okay, wait.

1633
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,820
Let me get it a little closer.

1634
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,160
There we go, there we go.

1635
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:26,480
Alright.

1636
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:28,340
Here we go!

1637
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:33,340
Well done.

1638
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:41,440
Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.

1639
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:47,500
For more information, please attend an enrichment center electrical safety seminar.

1640
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,560
That should be an achievement.

1641
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:58,260
That was crazy.

1642
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,020
You can shoot at midair too so you don't have to aim your jump.

1643
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,900
That is true, that is true.

1644
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,800
Welcome to the final test.

1645
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:11,360
When you are done, you will drop the device in the Equipment Recovery Annex.

1646
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:17,520
Enrichment Center regulations require both hands to be empty before any cake...

1647
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,540
Well, really?

1648
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:19,560
I mean cake?

1649
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,180
Before any cake?

1650
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:32,680
Before any cake?

1651
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:47,930
Before any cake.

1652
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,440
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1653
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,960
Uh, that's not good.

1654
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:01,360
Guys.

1655
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:05,400
Oops.

1656
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,200
No, no, no, no, no.

1657
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:13,500
I'm good.

1658
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:14,180
Ow!

1659
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:14,800
So close.

1660
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,420
Wait, wait.

1661
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,220
More, more, more.

1662
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:25,160
Ah!

1663
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:25,540
Oh!

1664
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:32,050
I'm trying to brute force it for real!

1665
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:35,550
Okay.

1666
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:37,830
Fine, I'll think with portals.

1667
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:41,350
Fine, I'll think with portals!

1668
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:44,270
Wait.

1669
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,840
Where is it?

1670
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:54,800
.

1671
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:58,220
Vital testing apparatus destroyed.

1672
01:50:59,600 --> 01:50:59,780
Where is it?

1673
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:07,540
Uh...

1674
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:08,920
Uh...

1675
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:10,560
Can I make this?

1676
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,660
Oh, I don't know if I can.

1677
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,600
Oh, yes I can.

1678
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:15,220
I'm a genius.

1679
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:16,100
Cake!

1680
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:16,560
Cake!

1681
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:17,580
Just around the corner!

1682
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:18,040
Cake!

1683
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,240
The test is now over.

1684
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:20,680
Uh-oh.

1685
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:26,020
All aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees Kelvin.

1686
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:34,340
Best assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory incandescence.

1687
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:39,780
Thank you for participating in this amateur science computer-aided enrichment activity.

1688
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,160
Are we the cake?

1689
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,020
Oh my god!

1690
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,220
Wait, I think this will...

1691
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:55,280
No, okay, it's...

1692
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,040
Yeah!

1693
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,600
Stop it.

1694
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:00,780
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

Made the correct party escort submission position decision.

1697
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:15,980
Party goer.

1698
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,840
So many birthday candles on that cake.

1699
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,940
I'm still young at heart.

1700
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:23,180
Don't get it twisted.

1701
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,760
I hate this game.

1702
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:32,320
Oh my gosh, that was me.

1703
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:44,930
I can't

1704
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:58,520
believe I haven't been jump scared the entire time And then suddenly I am

1705
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:08,280
Oh What are they doing with all these little turrets?

1706
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:11,360
Oh, go, go, go It's suddenly it's a horror game

1707
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:27,280
Whoa, freaky.

1708
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:34,210
Oh, locks can stop me, baby.

1709
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:39,330
The sound effects.

1710
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:42,470
I'm here.

1711
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:43,670
I know you're there.

1712
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:44,890
I can't see you.

1713
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:46,850
Hello.

1714
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,350
Which way we go?

1715
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:58,350
Both ways have...

1716
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:02,190
Both...

1717
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:06,350
Oh, there we go.

1718
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:10,570
Be careful.

1719
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:13,350
Alrighty.

1720
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:14,610
Oh, we got here.

1721
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:16,070
Some goopy soup.

1722
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:20,830
The real goop.

1723
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:24,970
Whoa!

1724
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:27,210
Cool!

1725
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:31,370
The turrets were the real horror this whole time!

1726
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:34,370
Yeah, we got some goopy soup over here.

1727
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:36,630
No.

1728
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:39,900
I can think of portals!

1729
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,480
I can think of portals!

1730
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:50,920
Nah, uh...

1731
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:55,440
If I, like, go from here...

1732
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,000
You think I can make it?

1733
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,280
Minky, that's me!

1734
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:04,980
I don't know if that's actually a quicksave or not.

1735
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:07,100
I don't think it is.

1736
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:10,220
I don't think it's quicksaving at all.

1737
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:14,900
Oh, yeah.

1738
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:28,610
Black Mesa!

1739
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:34,350
Oh, what is Black Mesa?

1740
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:56,950
2.59% of all DOD contracts, 10 billion in federal dollars annually 12% from full and open competition 88% from no bids or excluded sources bids not bound by government performance and results act 5 year review GSA schedules Black Mesa aperture whoa aperture is going crazy

1741
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:11,830
what's it mean a case study genetic life form and disc operating system defense logistics agency solicits bid for development of fuel System icing inhibitor.

1742
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:13,330
F-S-I-I.

1743
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,330
Black Mesa F-S-I-I proposal.

1744
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,760
Even the chairs are branded.

1745
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:25,460
Whoa!

1746
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,100
Oh my gosh, wait.

1747
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,760
They have the new Xbox!

1748
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:39,080
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, my, my.

1749
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:39,940
Baking pot.

1750
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:41,180
Oh wait, this is like cake.

1751
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:43,060
Cup of butter and margarine.

1752
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,340
This is just the cake recipe.

1753
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:51,440
What's this?

1754
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,400
Oh, nice...

1755
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:56,040
Tittle?

1756
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:01,920
Nice...

1757
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,080
Tittle jellyfish.

1758
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:06,580
Is this Half-Life 2?

1759
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:07,180
Yes.

1760
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:14,930
Oh my gosh, I was in there!

1761
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:17,230
What is this though?

1762
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:21,210
Number 2, 3, 4.

1763
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:21,810
Is that me?

1764
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:23,210
Oh, sorry.

1765
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:26,010
I'm trying to read.

1766
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:31,920
Why are the physics against me?

1767
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:48,340
Failed.

1768
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,320
Number 42 failed.

1769
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:52,420
Whoa, look at his proportions.

1770
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:55,300
Built like a damn chicken.

1771
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:00,340
I was in there!

1772
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:01,300
I was in there!

1773
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:02,260
I was in there!

1774
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:06,440
Wow, it's so fun.

1775
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:16,000
I remember that chamber.

1776
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,280
Yeah, me too.

1777
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:30,640
Oh, oh, just barely.

1778
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:31,820
Shoo.

1779
01:59:33,740 --> 01:59:34,380
Nothing?

1780
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,740
None of your beeswax, glados.

1781
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,480
You don't know that.

1782
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:41,680
Hello?

1783
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:43,500
Hello?

1784
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:46,200
The cake is a lie!

1785
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:46,980
The cake is a lie!

1786
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,040
The cake is a lie!

1787
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,120
Oh!

1788
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:53,780
Oh!

1789
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:55,080
Oh!

1790
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:55,140
Oh!

1791
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:55,500
Oh!

1792
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:55,560
Oh!

1793
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:56,320
Wait, oh!

1794
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:56,820
Oh!

1795
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:58,180
Oh!

1796
01:59:58,520 --> 01:59:58,720
Oh!

1797
01:59:59,200 --> 01:59:59,400
Oh!

1798
01:59:59,400 --> 01:59:59,400
Wow!

1799
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Oh!

1800
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:00,760
Wow!

1801
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:02,480
Wee!

1802
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:03,260
Wee!

1803
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,440
Okay, the test is over now.

1804
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:15,200
You win!

1805
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:18,240
Go back to the recovery annex for your cake.

1806
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:19,200
Okay!

1807
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:23,520
It was a fun test, and we're all impressed at how much you won.

1808
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:25,120
The test is over.

1809
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,420
Come back.

1810
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:30,580
Portal 1 and 2 genuinely have some of the best level design I've played in a game.

1811
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,300
Honestly, it's so true.

1812
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,000
Where's my cube?

1813
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:38,340
Give them to me.

1814
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,280
Actually, what am I supposed to do here?

1815
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:52,500
Like, I remember this...

1816
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:57,260
I remember this room where I went through the hole.

1817
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:03,980
But...

1818
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:06,060
Yeah, both portals this time.

1819
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:08,860
Oh!

1820
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:09,580
Wait.

1821
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:11,240
Oh!

1822
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,400
You're right.

1823
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:19,940
Ooh.

1824
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:28,460
They cut it!

1825
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:34,100
Horrible.

1826
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:35,640
Why wouldn't they wait?

1827
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:38,700
Uh, I think I can shoot that.

1828
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:41,080
Oh.

1829
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:43,180
Oh.

1830
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:44,940
Is something coming?

1831
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:47,120
Oh, okay, okay.

1832
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:49,280
No more cake!

1833
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:51,040
You guys!

1834
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:53,920
They seriously hate us.

1835
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:01,040
Oh, I think I need to portal over there.

1836
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,640
They started the party without us!

1837
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:09,440
Oh, I could have just walked.

1838
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:13,120
Ear protection must be worn in this area.

1839
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:15,620
Ear protection is very crucial, everybody.

1840
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,080
Take care of your ears.

1841
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:23,600
I have to take a special...

1842
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:23,860
Oh.

1843
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:25,100
Okay, just kidding.

1844
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,840
I have to take a special care of mine because they're big.

1845
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:33,920
I'm looking around for a wall.

1846
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:36,020
Really?

1847
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:37,280
Okay.

1848
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:41,110
Am I blind?

1849
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,820
Why can't I find a wall that I can...

1850
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:49,080
Portal.

1851
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:54,970
Look down?

1852
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:08,260
It's so cool when it does that.

1853
02:03:18,370 --> 02:03:19,970
How did you get in here?

1854
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:22,130
Over here.

1855
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:27,710
But... Oh wait, oh.

1856
02:03:28,730 --> 02:03:29,070
Oh!

1857
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:30,570
Whoa, whoa!

1858
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:33,510
Oh, whoa, whoa!

1859
02:03:34,050 --> 02:03:34,290
Okay.

1860
02:03:37,090 --> 02:03:37,770
Okay.

1861
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:44,830
Wow!

1862
02:03:45,210 --> 02:03:46,170
Okay, we're good.

1863
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:51,350
How do you?

1864
02:03:53,670 --> 02:03:55,890
Come on, let me in easily.

1865
02:03:57,350 --> 02:04:00,010
Stop making me take tough ways to get in and out.

1866
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:03,050
Ride the piston.

1867
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:06,950
I just shot orange, so I need to shoot it.

1868
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:15,700
Wait?

1869
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:16,660
Oh.

1870
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:18,820
No!

1871
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:20,780
Wait, I shot the wrong thing!

1872
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:26,260
Wait, oh, I shot blue, but...

1873
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:26,900
Oh, my bad.

1874
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:29,980
Okay, so that's blue.

1875
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,420
So we shoot orange.

1876
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:34,140
Oh my god.

1877
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:37,660
Are you not...

1878
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:41,640
Are you really playing Portal if you don't accidentally shoot the wrong thing, you know?

1879
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:45,880
Which way is up?

1880
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:49,640
Okay.

1881
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:57,000
Oops.

1882
02:04:57,620 --> 02:04:58,820
Oh, we almost had a loop.

1883
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:02,000
There we go.

1884
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:03,280
Alright.

1885
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:08,980
You're not even going the right way.

1886
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:10,940
Where do you think you're always?

1887
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:13,400
I don't think you're going.

1888
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:14,900
Where do you think you're going?

1889
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,300
You don't know where I'm going, Lados.

1890
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:17,180
You have no idea.

1891
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:18,520
Hello?

1892
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:22,140
I like how she's, like, talking to herself.

1893
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:23,460
And then it's like, eh?

1894
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:24,100
Hello?

1895
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:26,100
Can I fall in between this?

1896
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,500
You cannot!

1897
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:31,400
Oh.

1898
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:37,720
They're like, you are literally playing portal game right now, and you're going to take the stairs.

1899
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:41,340
You're going to try a ladder when you're playing portal game.

1900
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:43,700
Don't be ridiculous right now.

1901
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:51,580
Help!

1902
02:05:51,980 --> 02:05:52,880
The cake is a lie!

1903
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:53,800
Cake is a lie!

1904
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:58,920
Do you guys remember that guy's computer?

1905
02:05:59,300 --> 02:05:59,740
Beans!

1906
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:01,180
More cake is a lie.

1907
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:02,260
More cake is a lie.

1908
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:04,920
Who else?

1909
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,300
Who else was like crawling through these vents?

1910
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:08,780
I have to wonder.

1911
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:19,540
Whoa.

1912
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:30,520
Oh, I go all the way to the floor.

1913
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:31,880
I didn't even need to do all of this.

1914
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:35,480
The rat man.

1915
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,120
Who's that guy?

1916
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:40,440
Oh, it goes to the ceiling?

1917
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:48,720
We live and we learn.

1918
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:51,620
Let's see what's on this side anyway.

1919
02:06:56,380 --> 02:06:58,500
Okay, this doesn't even...

1920
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:08,220
My plan squashed again!

1921
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:11,360
I've been...

1922
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:12,300
Wait, oh.

1923
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:14,200
Wait, oh.

1924
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:14,900
Oh.

1925
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:17,580
Sorry.

1926
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:18,580
What?

1927
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:24,100
You're not even going the right way.

1928
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:28,480
Where do you think you're going?

1929
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:31,200
Where do you think you're going?

1930
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:33,140
Where do you think you're going?

1931
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:34,280
Okay.

1932
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:36,560
This works.

1933
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:39,960
Hello,

1934
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:49,000
loving the stream!

1935
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:49,540
Hi!

1936
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:50,680
Thank you!

1937
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,740
Today I learned you can stand there!

1938
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:57,260
Minto pancakes.

1939
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:00,060
Yummy!

1940
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,420
Oh, those two go to the ceiling!

1941
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:13,200
Today I learned?

1942
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:26,020
right now I learned everything else doesn't go to the ceiling only the ones the two that I specifically chose yeah the ceiling tells you

1943
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:41,060
only the two exact ones that I decided to go through trying to decide though like what's the way to do this oh

1944
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,300
Where am I?

1945
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:09,220
It's a 50% chance.

1946
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:09,920
It's not.

1947
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:13,280
If I run and jump...

1948
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:17,040
Good thing there's no fall damage.

1949
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:22,340
It has a portal surface.

1950
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:23,320
What does?

1951
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:25,440
What has a portal surface?

1952
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:26,760
What?

1953
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:44,980
Oh, I didn't see it at the end of the hallway.

1954
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,100
Totally overthinking it.

1955
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:48,780
Okay, that one.

1956
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:51,460
That one, though, I didn't realize that it had a portal surface.

1957
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:51,980
That's why.

1958
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:55,840
I just didn't see it.

1959
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:59,040
Didn't we have some fun, though?

1960
02:09:59,260 --> 02:09:59,860
Yeah, so fun.

1961
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:05,420
No way.

1962
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:12,230
That was great.

1963
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:14,190
So fun.

1964
02:10:14,550 --> 02:10:21,120
it was so fun it was like so fun glados oh there we go okay i need to get up there

1965
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:32,480

1966
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:43,180

1967
02:10:46,840 --> 02:11:00,920
ah Wait, oh, they both...

1968
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,960
Oh, I think I broke it.

1969
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:11,280
Maybe I do a further one away.

1970
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:13,160
No worries.

1971
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:17,320
No worries.

1972
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:19,400
No worries.

1973
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:21,000
That's what I sound like.

1974
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:21,780
No worries.

1975
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:26,040
Okay, oh wait.

1976
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:27,200
Okay, uh, shoot.

1977
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:27,960
Oh, geez.

1978
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,560
Oh, I can't see.

1979
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,080
I'm not fast enough.

1980
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:38,000
Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit?

1981
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:41,140
I said goodbye, and you were like, No word.

1982
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:42,300
And then I was off.

1983
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,640
We pretended we were going to murder you.

1984
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:45,440
No word.

1985
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:46,700
That was great.

1986
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:51,460
Is anyone there?

1987
02:11:54,580 --> 02:12:10,000
Oh, well, I figured it out i think oh okay i'm not even like moving it put it forces you out of the portal so it's not like i am i am looking

1988
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:31,400
you know what i mean or it's not like i'm forceful i'm what's the word it's not like i'm trying to jump off of it is what i'm trying to say Where do I go from here, though?

1989
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:33,120
Okay, good.

1990
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:34,900
I thought it would go all the way in.

1991
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,440
Um, oh, over here, probably.

1992
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:39,800
Okay.

1993
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,360
Uh, is there another wall?

1994
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:44,820
That I can go- Oh, duh.

1995
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:50,480
Which way is up?

1996
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:50,780
Okay.

1997
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:53,080
Does this open?

1998
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:54,620
No?

1999
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:57,400
Um.

2000
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:59,940
Okay, we're making my way downtown.

2001
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:01,140
Walking.

2002
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:01,840
fast.

2003
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Space is past.

2004
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:07,260
I'm homebound.

2005
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:11,280
Over that way.

2006
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:13,260
Okay.

2007
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:15,300
How do I get over there?

2008
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:20,660
How goes your own welcome to Mambushabdaku!

2009
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:25,680
I need the momentum.

2010
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:29,900
Okay.

2011
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:30,860
Okay, okay, okay.

2012
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:37,760
So...

2013
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:39,260
Okay.

2014
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:42,280
If I...

2015
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:44,300
Why am I suddenly losing the plot?

2016
02:13:44,420 --> 02:13:46,280
Okay, I need to...

2017
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:47,640
Will I make it?

2018
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:49,420
Oh.

2019
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:50,780
No.

2020
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:53,360
I messed up a little bit.

2021
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:54,260
My bad.

2022
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:55,160
Okay, hold on.

2023
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,160
I messed up a little bit.

2024
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:39,590
Okay, okay, okay.

2025
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:42,630
Let's go even higher.

2026
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:48,580
Okay, orange.

2027
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:50,340
Orange, you glad.

2028
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,520
I didn't say banana!

2029
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:54,780
Okay, we're good.

2030
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:55,840
Everything's fine.

2031
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:58,660
Oh, no, everything is not fine.

2032
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:04,160
You really shouldn't be.

2033
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:23,300

02:15:37,310 --> 02:15:39,250
Don't you mean this car?

2036
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:57,520
Just trying to figure out where to go.

2037
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:03,560
What is the purpose of all the Smashers?

2038
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:05,660
Great question.

2039
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:09,420
They're just noisy.

2040
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:10,400
That's what they are.

2041
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:23,030
Oh, wait.

2042
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:24,010
That's not an up.

2043
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:25,830
What's up?

2044
02:16:26,770 --> 02:16:27,230
What's up?

2045
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:27,930
What's up?

2046
02:16:27,930 --> 02:16:28,170
What's up?

2047
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:35,800
I almost had it.

2048
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:53,620
Okay, okay.

2049
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:54,780
I see, I see.

2050
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,280
If I...

2051
02:16:57,710 --> 02:16:58,540
I'm in blue.

2052
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:01,960
If I orange over there...

2053
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,620
I should be able to make it back.

2054
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:08,720
Oh, I made it somehow!

2055
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:10,780
Ah!

2056
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:12,600
I made it somehow!

2057
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:14,140
I made it somehow!

2058
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:17,040
Okay, cool.

2059
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:21,240
This way?

2060
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:27,400
Let's just save.

2061
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:28,920
Anything over here?

2062
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:29,140
No.

2063
02:17:29,420 --> 02:17:29,420
Okay.

2064
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:31,760
What's the exit?

2065
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:34,020
Oh, this way?

2066
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:35,460
Or not that way.

2067
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:36,180
No, not that way.

2068
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:36,740
This way.

2069
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:43,490
Which way do we go?

2070
02:17:44,830 --> 02:17:45,310
Here!

2071
02:17:46,370 --> 02:17:47,010
Oh, okay.

2072
02:17:49,130 --> 02:17:50,510
I can't hear you, Gladys.

2073
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:50,910
Oh.

2074
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:56,190
What's so far?

2075
02:17:56,210 --> 02:18:21,280

2076
02:18:24,470 --> 02:18:27,990
i'm trying to see maybe here

2077
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,940
Oh my gosh, I made it!

2078
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:46,840
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2079
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:49,520
I made it, I made it!

2080
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:54,600
Down?

2081
02:18:55,860 --> 02:18:58,120
Okay, I'm trusting the bloody handprints.

2082
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,680
Try using portals?

2083
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:03,200
Never.

2084
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,520
Oh, what do you think the name of this game is?

2085
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:06,680
Help!

2086
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:08,480
Why would you need help?

2087
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:11,320
You have all the water and beads you could ever ask for.

2088
02:19:12,820 --> 02:19:13,300
Help?

2089
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,040
Ungrateful.

2090
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:17,540
And you got the latest Xbox.

2091
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:18,860
The 360.

2092
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:31,070
Cube.

2093
02:19:32,550 --> 02:19:33,830
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

2094
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:36,670
They did that on purpose, didn't they?

2095
02:19:38,430 --> 02:19:38,730
Uh oh.

2096
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:48,140
Am I?

2097
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:49,300
Am I still here?

2098
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:50,660
Oh no, no way.

2099
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:51,840
Wait, this is evil!

2100
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:53,800
Wait, this is so evil!

2101
02:19:57,140 --> 02:19:57,900
Ah,

2102
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:02,980
okay.

2103
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:04,960
Okay, we lived.

2104
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:23,900
Okay, all right.

2105
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:24,640
That's two down.

2106
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:25,580
One more.

2107
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:32,080
Hi.

2108
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:37,300
We're good?

2109
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:38,560
What's this?

2110
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:39,480
Oh.

2111
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:43,240
How do I get in there?

2112
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:45,380
The claw.

2113
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:50,260
Beam me up!

2114
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:54,460
How do we get in there?

2115
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:57,080
Oh, somehow.

2116
02:20:58,180 --> 02:20:58,260
Ugh.

2117
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:06,860
They were like, hey, you didn't forget about all those turrets that you had to deal with, right?

2118
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:16,150
All those turrets that we also made you deal with?

2119
02:21:17,370 --> 02:21:20,610
Like, those are still definitely active in the thing.

2120
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:26,960
Oh, but the exit.

2121
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:28,500
is this way.

2122
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:30,480
But, wait, do I go in there?

2123
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:31,580
If I drop?

2124
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:41,360
Oh, gosh.

2125
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:41,800
Oh, gosh.

2126
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:47,100
You can portal them for fun.

2127
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:50,760
I don't know if I can.

2128
02:22:02,590 --> 02:22:02,790
Ah.

2129
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:03,630
Ah.

2130
02:22:04,750 --> 02:22:11,960
Oh, I guess I could have gone down through there, I suppose.

2131
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:16,000
But what's the point?

2132
02:22:16,340 --> 02:22:16,840
Let's go so quick.

2133
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:17,340
Let's just go.

2134
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:19,420
Hello.

2135
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:21,380
Searching.

2136
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:26,620
I'm trying to drop.

2137
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:27,680
Wait.

2138
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:29,300
Searching.

2139
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:32,260
How did that open?

2140
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:35,260
Freaky!

2141
02:22:35,740 --> 02:22:36,480
Freaky, freaky!

2142
02:22:44,650 --> 02:22:45,930
Just looking around.

2143
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:49,310
Over here, what?

2144
02:22:52,870 --> 02:22:53,750
A ghost?

2145
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:58,210
More... ramblings?

2146
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:02,190
Hello, can I help you?

2147
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:06,210
Cake is a lie, cake is a lie, cake is a lie, cake is a lie, there's no cake.

2148
02:23:07,970 --> 02:23:09,910
But what if...

2149
02:23:09,910 --> 02:23:10,670
And she's watching.

2150
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:12,150
Okay, it's all the same ramblings.

2151
02:23:12,310 --> 02:23:14,550
Okay, this person is like crazy, but they're consistent.

2152
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:18,310
They just write the same thing over and over again.

2153
02:23:22,970 --> 02:23:24,750
Where do I...

2154
02:23:27,350 --> 02:23:27,730
Aha!

2155
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:29,050
Okay.

2156
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:46,810
The definition of insanity.

2157
02:23:46,990 --> 02:23:48,290
I suppose so, right?

2158
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:50,190
This is your fault.

2159
02:23:50,990 --> 02:23:52,950
It didn't have to be like this.

2160
02:23:54,310 --> 02:23:55,330
I'm not kidding now.

2161
02:23:55,510 --> 02:23:58,030
Turn back or I will kill you.

2162
02:23:58,250 --> 02:23:59,350
It wouldn't!

2163
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:00,890
You love me too much!

2164
02:24:01,090 --> 02:24:01,710
I'm going to kill you.

2165
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:03,610
And all the cake is gone.

2166
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:06,750
You don't even care, do you?

2167
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:08,770
This is your last chance.

2168
02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:11,670
Number 42 again.

2169
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:19,110
Wait, let me save.

2170
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:26,080
Hello?

2171
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:32,600
I remember beating this game, but I don't remember beating it.

2172
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:33,220
You know what I mean?

2173
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:35,980
Rocket!

2174
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:37,240
Oh my god.

2175
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:37,940
Wait.

2176
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:41,180
Uh.

2177
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:42,420
Wait.

2178
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:48,950
I missed.

2179
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:50,750
How could you miss?

2180
02:24:51,370 --> 02:24:53,310
How could you miss?

2181
02:24:56,010 --> 02:24:56,290
Oh!

2182
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:04,260
Guys, I think I'm bad at this.

2183
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:05,520
Okay, hold on.

2184
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:07,320
Line it up, line it up.

2185
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:08,880
There we go.

2186
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,240
Oh wait, do I need to break this?

2187
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,180
Ah, okay, just kidding.

2188
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,080
I thought I was trying to destroy it.

2189
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:39,620

Wait.

2199
02:26:56,680 --> 02:26:57,760

2201
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:00,440
For a cube!

2202
02:27:00,980 --> 02:27:01,120
For a cube!

2203
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:04,800
How do I do that?

2204
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:05,360
Oh, wait.

2205
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:08,660
Ah, okay, so we do need to go back.

2206
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:09,280
Okay, just kidding.

2207
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:16,400
I'm not going to lie.

2208
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:19,020
I thought about, like, bringing one of these things back here.

2209
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:23,660
Was that enough?

2210
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:24,380
Wait.

2211
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:26,600
Oh.

2212
02:27:34,670 --> 02:27:35,570
It never...

2213
02:27:35,570 --> 02:27:35,750
Uh.

2214
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:43,050
Yeah, it still needs to see me.

2215
02:27:44,010 --> 02:27:45,240
And it's also...

2216
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:07,620
Cube!

2217
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:13,460
Fun!

2218
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:17,620
That works too.

2219
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:19,980
Was there a different method you were thinking of?

2220
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:23,780
This isn't gonna like destroy me, is it?

2221
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:26,420
Why can't I just leave?

2222
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:28,820
Wait, how do I...

2223
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:30,860
Is it gonna kill me?

2224
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:32,520
Oh!

2225
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:34,440
Oh, that's evil.

2226
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:36,580
Wait a second.

2227
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:38,420
That's so evil, though.

2228
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:41,560
Leap of faith?

2229
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:42,740
I'll try it.

2230
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:44,080
Wait, I'm stuck.

2231
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,500
Okay, it literally does not let you.

2232
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:51,960
Okay.

2233
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:55,980
I used a chair last time.

2234
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:56,680
That works, too.

2235
02:28:57,260 --> 02:28:58,660
I want to see something strange and mystical.

2236
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:01,060
Try putting a portal on the hydraulic press.

2237
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:05,000
The hydraulic...

2238
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:05,160
Uh...

2239
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:05,740
Uh...

2240
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:06,120
Huh?

2241
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:09,120
I think I'm beyond the hydraulic presto.

2242
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:10,760
What did I shoot?

2243
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:18,840
Oh, okay.

2244
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:21,060
Ew, who's using the toilet?

2245
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:24,760
Oh, that was me.

2246
02:29:25,220 --> 02:29:25,820
That was me?

2247
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,280
That was me over there.

2248
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:30,720
A lot of people use a chair.

2249
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:34,100
I think that was definitely the easier method.

2250
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:38,700
I think it's kind of fun, though, to be a little extra, you know?

2251
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:44,040
We're going up, up, up, up, it's our moment.

2252
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:49,630
Is this toilet water?

2253
02:29:50,850 --> 02:29:51,950
Where can I walk in this?

2254
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:53,210
Oh.

2255
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:55,550
Okay, definitely toilet water.

2256
02:29:59,480 --> 02:29:59,780
Whoa.

2257
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:00,520
Whoa!

2258
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:02,980
Oh my gosh.

2259
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:17,750
Oops.

2260
02:30:18,190 --> 02:30:19,060
That's not what I meant to do.

2261
02:30:23,070 --> 02:30:23,610
All

2262
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:38,320
right, one at a time, one at a time.

2263
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:46,260
Put me down.

2264
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:46,400
I

2265
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:53,460
know the music jump scare for real.

2266
02:31:00,430 --> 02:31:01,110
Go activation.

2267
02:31:10,380 --> 02:31:10,540
Okay.

2268
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,320
Who's there?

2269
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:21,740
Uh-oh.

2270
02:31:21,740 --> 02:31:22,700
Uh-oh.

2271
02:31:26,300 --> 02:31:27,800
Critical error.

2272
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:32,460
Oh, that's me!

2273
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:33,040
Hi!

2274
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:36,500
I'm saving real quick.

2275
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:40,580
Hey.

2276
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:48,720
I don't hate you.

2277
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:50,740
Um...

2278
02:31:52,180 --> 02:31:53,540
I think this is one.

2279
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:56,000
Who are you?

2280
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:57,400
Amita!

2281
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:02,920
Critical error.

2282
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:06,680
Okay, there's one down in the middle.

2283
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:08,900
Okay, I think we have two left.

2284
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:11,180
Who are you?

2285
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:11,840
Okay, because you

2286
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:20,990
I can't tell.

2287
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:24,170
Oh, yeah.

2288
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:25,310
What about him?

2289
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:26,970
Who are you?

2290
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:30,530
Oh, my gosh.

2291
02:32:30,890 --> 02:32:31,730
Wait, that's so awkward.

2292
02:32:32,290 --> 02:32:32,490
Wait.

2293
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:33,290
There we go.

2294
02:32:41,210 --> 02:32:42,890
Okay, there we go.

2295
02:32:43,490 --> 02:32:44,270
This should be the last...

2296
02:32:44,270 --> 02:32:44,690
Oh, nope.

2297
02:32:44,770 --> 02:32:45,210
There's a couple.

2298
02:32:45,290 --> 02:32:45,690
There's one more.

2299
02:32:48,950 --> 02:32:52,210
My computer is busted and there's a new terror game.

2300
02:32:52,670 --> 02:32:53,030
Astronomy thing.

2301
02:32:53,490 --> 02:32:54,310
I wanted to play it, but again.

2302
02:32:54,490 --> 02:32:55,970
PC busted and laptop sluggish.

2303
02:32:56,090 --> 02:32:56,350
No!

2304
02:32:58,090 --> 02:32:59,810
Could you play Voices of the Void someday?

2305
02:32:59,910 --> 02:33:00,350
I have!

2306
02:33:00,610 --> 02:33:02,310
I have played Voices of the Void.

2307
02:33:04,830 --> 02:33:06,370
I guess I should go back to it.

2308
02:33:06,770 --> 02:33:08,870
Beautiful watching my Oshi play my favorite game of all time.

2309
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:10,730
My Arthur, thank you so much.

2310
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:12,710
For the Akazuma, thank you!

2311
02:33:13,070 --> 02:33:14,070
Thank you!

2312
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:20,900
I don't blame you.

2313
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:24,300
Yeah.

2314
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:28,180
Ah!

2315
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:32,700
Victoria voices are cute.

2316
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:36,740
Okay, alright, we got rid of all of them then.

2317
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:40,300
So, actually I'm just gonna drop down here.

2318
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:45,140
Because I saw that.

2319
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:46,820
Wait, how can I get to there though?

2320
02:33:47,980 --> 02:33:48,880
Wait, there's another one.

2321
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:49,540
There's another launcher.

2322
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:51,500
There's two launchers!

2323
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:54,380
Alrighty, already, already, already, already, already.

2324
02:34:05,690 --> 02:34:08,730
I guess maybe I just go back how I did?

2325
02:34:09,230 --> 02:34:10,290
Wait, hold on.

2326
02:34:11,050 --> 02:34:12,110
Big brain time.

2327
02:34:12,330 --> 02:34:14,670
Yeah, I have to figure out...

2328
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:16,990
Wait, where's another...

2329
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:17,370
Eee?

2330
02:34:18,270 --> 02:34:18,790
Eee?

2331
02:34:22,730 --> 02:34:23,910
How do I get higher?

2332
02:34:28,260 --> 02:34:29,960
I guess just like that?

2333
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:33,160
I guess I just picked the higher one first.

2334
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:34,880
All right, all right.

2335
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:53,500
Hi, Minto.

2336
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:54,080
Hello!

2337
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:59,300
Well, why did it feel like I went so high up in the air before?

2338
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:03,940
It's so cool.

2339
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,000
What a cool room.

2340
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:10,480
Um, and yeah, I can't shoot over there.

2341
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:11,920
Oh, I can't shoot under this.

2342
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:12,380
Okay.

2343
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:16,660
Gamers don't look up.

2344
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:17,900
I am looking up!

2345
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:19,920
I see that, but I don't...

2346
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:22,980
Wait, hold on.

2347
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:29,940
Oh, wait.

2348
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:30,660
Okay, maybe...

2349
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:31,740
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2350
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:32,980
Okay, okay, okay.

2351
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:34,500
Okay.

2352
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:34,880
Okay.

2353
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:35,200
Okay.

2354
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:38,680
And then it'll launch me.

2355
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:41,500
And I need to do...

2356
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:51,020
Blue?

2357
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:52,140
Oh!

2358
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:54,160
Ah!

2359
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:54,940
Wait.

2360
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:55,240
Oh.

2361
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:56,520
Wait.

2362
02:36:17,770 --> 02:36:18,210
Oh.

2363
02:36:18,470 --> 02:36:18,610
Oh.

2364
02:36:18,610 --> 02:36:18,650
Oh.

2365
02:36:18,650 --> 02:36:18,690
Oh.

2366
02:36:25,550 --> 02:36:26,270
Hold on.

2367
02:36:26,730 --> 02:36:28,070
You got this, Mito, right?

2368
02:36:28,310 --> 02:36:29,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2369
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:31,210
Don't worry about it.

2370
02:36:34,050 --> 02:36:36,230
Can we jump down from somewhere higher?

2371
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:37,290
I don't...

2372
02:36:37,290 --> 02:36:38,770
I think this is the highest one, no?

2373
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,410
Why?

2374
02:36:39,410 --> 02:36:41,410
What I'm gonna try and do is...

2375
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:45,670
Oh my gosh!

2376
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:46,070
Wait!

2377
02:36:46,890 --> 02:36:47,230
Oh.

2378
02:36:49,990 --> 02:36:51,910
Unless up there?

2379
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:09,860
Not the correct wall.

2380
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:18,480
Need to do some mid-air portaling.

2381
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:26,180
I think we need to get more momentum.

2382
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:28,720
Oh, this one's tricky.

2383
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:29,780
This one's tough for me.

2384
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,480
So I do.

2385
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:46,200
Don't overthink.

2386
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:47,560
I always overthink.

2387
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,540
I'm trying not to overthink.

2388
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,620
You're going speedruns.

2389
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:11,120
strats?

2390
02:38:11,380 --> 02:38:11,780
No way!

2391
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:12,720
What do you mean?

2392
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:20,180
Wait, that didn't do it.

2393
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:21,310
Did that do it?

2394
02:38:22,380 --> 02:38:23,360
Wait, no, no, no.

2395
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:24,940
Let me in, please.

2396
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:26,300
Let me in, please.

2397
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:26,700
There we go.

2398
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:36,500
You're on the right track.

2399
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:37,640
I...

2400
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:47,420
I'm like not getting the order of operations.

2401
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:51,200
Thank you so much!

2402
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:52,820
Last in the store!

2403
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:53,940
Thank you so much for the gift, dude.

2404
02:38:54,220 --> 02:38:54,460
Thank you!

2405
02:39:01,170 --> 02:39:03,610
Gotta hit the other slant midair.

2406
02:39:04,390 --> 02:39:06,150
Then shoot at the ground as you land.

2407
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:13,140
Hem the ass?

2408
02:39:13,240 --> 02:39:14,320
Yeah, I don't know.

2409
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:17,180
Yeah, just use portals, dummy.

2410
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:18,820
Just portal.

2411
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:20,300
Just play portal.

2412
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:21,460
Just play the game, dummy.

2413
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:22,760
Just play the game.

2414
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:26,520
Think with portals.

2415
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:27,720
I'm trying.

2416
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:29,140
I'm trying.

2417
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:35,600
Oh, dang it.

2418
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:38,760
I need to stop trying to aim for this one.

2419
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:42,760
I need to like reshoot it or something.

2420
02:39:54,920 --> 02:39:55,880
Okay, so...

2421
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,060
I go through that.

2422
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:01,780
Go through this.

2423
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:05,160
So I go down.

2424
02:40:05,580 --> 02:40:05,900
Pew!

2425
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,780
Then I go down again, and I'm even faster.

2426
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:14,040
And then I go pew, and I shoot this one.

2427
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:17,300
And I go pew, the other side.

2428
02:40:19,720 --> 02:40:21,320
That's how I do.

2429
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:24,040
If you're a speedrunner, yes.

2430
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:24,660
No way!

2431
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:27,280
That seems like this is the only option.

2432
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:28,200
No!

2433
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:30,840
Okay.

2434
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:36,940
So then, once I go down, pew, down...

2435
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:51,880
I go through this and I Wait Wait hold on Not really but this is cooler What?

2436
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:57,480
Okay what I still want to try it I still want to try it

2437
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:24,600
Sounds cool so I say go for it No wrong way definitely more satisfying ways Remember to say pew Okay wait I'm trying to remember what when i get to this peel what do i i make it what color wait okay down

2438

2440
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:01,580
Ah!

2441
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:04,040
Ah!

2442
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:06,660
Wait, okay, let's just try it.

2443
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:09,320
Let's just try it.

2444
02:42:38,860 --> 02:42:40,280
I'm still confused.

2445
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:43,800
But...

2446
02:42:49,340 --> 02:42:51,840
I'm still confused, but...

2447
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:52,720
It's fine.

2448
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:55,120
Wait, why'd you guys say no?

2449
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:55,940
I had it.

2450
02:43:00,470 --> 02:43:02,190
You had the blue in the right spot.

2451
02:43:03,850 --> 02:43:05,890
Oh, you're right, I could have just...

2452
02:43:05,890 --> 02:43:09,070
Oh, I could have just launched myself.

2453
02:43:09,950 --> 02:43:10,870
Oh, whatever.

2454
02:43:13,630 --> 02:43:14,090
Phew!

2455
02:43:17,270 --> 02:43:17,730
And...

2456
02:43:17,730 --> 02:43:17,910
Oh.

2457
02:43:22,850 --> 02:43:24,150
Guys, this one...

2458
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:25,830
I'm not gonna get every puzzle, okay?

2459
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:29,230
I'm not gonna...

2460
02:43:29,230 --> 02:43:30,230
And that's okay.

2461
02:43:31,210 --> 02:43:33,010
Some puzzles will confuse me more than others.

2462
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:33,850
It's all right.

2463
02:43:35,930 --> 02:43:37,410
Didn't say pew fast enough.

2464
02:43:37,630 --> 02:43:38,010
I know.

2465
02:43:43,710 --> 02:43:44,790
So there?

2466
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:46,750
And then...

2467
02:43:46,750 --> 02:43:50,230
But the thing is, is I have it here, but then...

2468
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:52,270
How can I jump down from anywhere?

2469
02:43:53,270 --> 02:43:53,990
Is my question.

2470
02:43:55,530 --> 02:43:57,250
Like, how can I get the momentum to speed?

2471
02:44:00,290 --> 02:44:01,630
Where am I?

2472
02:44:02,470 --> 02:44:03,010
Oh.

2473
02:44:03,030 --> 02:44:03,850
Oh.

2474
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:09,140
Oh.

2475
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:28,340
I don't know where it went.

2476
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,860
How did it get back up here?

2477
02:44:46,430 --> 02:44:48,890
We did it?

2478
02:44:52,450 --> 02:44:53,370
Oh.

2479
02:44:53,930 --> 02:44:54,270
Yeah.

2480
02:44:55,930 --> 02:44:57,410
I meant to do that.

2481
02:45:04,900 --> 02:45:05,480
Whoa!

2482
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:07,960
Whoa!

2483
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:16,710
Yeah, I totally meant to do that.

2484
02:45:31,010 --> 02:45:32,410
Good job, Minto.

2485
02:45:32,890 --> 02:45:33,730
Thank you!

2486
02:45:34,410 --> 02:45:35,520
Oh, it's so bright here.

2487
02:45:39,890 --> 02:45:41,510
Think harder for this.

2488
02:45:42,350 --> 02:45:44,430
Oh, you're asking a big task, you know?

2489
02:45:45,930 --> 02:45:50,850
You're asking for some... for a real big ask, you know?

2490
02:45:54,570 --> 02:45:55,430
Wait a second.

2491
02:45:56,730 --> 02:45:57,550
Wait a second, wait a second.

2492
02:45:57,910 --> 02:45:58,610
I think I get it.

2493
02:46:01,890 --> 02:46:03,210
It's scary though.

2494
02:46:03,630 --> 02:46:04,590
It's scary though.

2495
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:07,850
But I can make it!

2496
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:12,220
Dang it.

2497
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:18,020
I don't know why I didn't let me move though.

2498
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:21,300
Alright, alright.

2499
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:24,420
Oh, shoot.

2500
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:27,200
Oh no, now I'm- now I'm the turret.

2501
02:46:27,460 --> 02:46:28,300
Oh, I can't move!

2502
02:46:28,480 --> 02:46:28,760
Ah!

2503
02:46:29,080 --> 02:46:30,000
Wait, please, please!

2504
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:33,180
Okay.

2505
02:46:38,350 --> 02:46:40,650
I'm gonna try for this one instead.

2506
02:46:42,650 --> 02:46:44,290
Oh, oh, where am I?

2507
02:46:44,850 --> 02:46:45,050
Oh.

2508
02:46:46,510 --> 02:46:48,030
Okay, I don't think that's a-

2509
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:54,800
Let me move this.

2510
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:56,400
Is this a little closer maybe?

2511
02:46:57,240 --> 02:46:57,720
Like here?

2512
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:03,120
And then...

2513
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:04,820
And then...

2514
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:07,580
Oh!

2515
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:08,720
Where am I?

2516
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:09,820
Oh my gosh!

2517
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:10,300
Thank you!

2518
02:47:10,300 --> 02:47:11,240
Okay, too close.

2519
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:12,240
Too close.

2520
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:24,160
I know, I bonked my head.

2521
02:47:27,540 --> 02:47:28,820
Please!

2522
02:47:29,820 --> 02:47:30,120
Yeah!

2523
02:47:39,950 --> 02:47:41,570
Where am I?

2524
02:47:42,190 --> 02:47:43,050
Oops.

2525
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:46,570
My bad.

2526
02:47:48,590 --> 02:47:48,670
Um.

2527
02:47:49,750 --> 02:47:50,650
There we go.

2528
02:47:52,770 --> 02:47:53,830
Don't mind me.

2529
02:47:55,130 --> 02:47:55,950
Don't mind me.

2530
02:47:57,110 --> 02:47:57,770
Wow.

2531
02:47:58,030 --> 02:47:58,710
Wow.

2532
02:47:59,570 --> 02:47:59,730
Wow.

2533
02:48:00,810 --> 02:48:01,330
Wow.

2534
02:48:02,490 --> 02:48:03,230
What if I jumped?

2535
02:48:05,170 --> 02:48:07,790
What if I just jumped right now?

2536
02:48:11,390 --> 02:48:13,390
What equipment stops and starts suddenly?

2537
02:48:14,110 --> 02:48:15,550
I haven't heard from GLaDOS in a while.

2538
02:48:15,710 --> 02:48:16,290
You think she's okay?

2539
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:20,690
Oh, more of a Black Mesa stuff.

2540
02:48:29,780 --> 02:48:30,740
Oh, chairs.

2541
02:48:31,620 --> 02:48:34,700
Who's just, like, sitting here watching the world go by?

2542
02:48:39,830 --> 02:49:36,610
Glados of course I care about her wait is that her right there my queen well you found me congratulations was it worth it because despite your violent behavior the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day I guess we both know that isn't going to happen you chose this path now i'd have a surprise for you what's that deploying surprise in five four time out for a second that wasn't supposed to happen do you see that thing that fell out of me what is that it's not the surprise i've never seen it before never mind she's so cute i'll solve later by myself because you'll be dead i wouldn't bother with that thing my guess is that Somehow.

2543
02:49:38,370 --> 02:49:38,850
Um.

2544
02:49:40,810 --> 02:49:45,170
We gotta- I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone.

2545
02:49:45,270 --> 02:49:45,990
Look how cute.

2546
02:49:47,070 --> 02:49:48,530
Where are you taking that thing?

2547
02:49:49,050 --> 02:49:50,350
Don't call it that thing.

2548
02:49:50,690 --> 02:49:50,830
No?

2549
02:49:50,890 --> 02:49:53,930
Do you think I'm trying to trick you with reverse psychology?

2550
02:49:54,230 --> 02:49:55,910
I mean, seriously now.

2551
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:57,230
Seriously.

2552
02:49:57,750 --> 02:49:58,230
Seriously?

2553
02:49:59,510 --> 02:50:00,390
Just a little guy?

2554
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:01,750
Okay, fine.

2555
02:50:02,090 --> 02:50:02,950
Do touch it.

2556
02:50:03,290 --> 02:50:05,610
Pick it up and just stuff it back into me.

2557
02:50:06,390 --> 02:50:07,950
Oh my gosh, I wish I could run.

2558
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:08,750
I wish I could run.

2559
02:50:08,830 --> 02:50:09,550
Let's be honest.

2560
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:11,930
Neither one of us knows what that thing does.

2561
02:50:12,590 --> 02:50:15,410
Just put it in the corner, and I'll deal with it later.

2562
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:17,830
Time to think with portals!

2563
02:50:19,230 --> 02:50:21,770
That thing is probably some kind of raw sewage container.

2564
02:50:22,130 --> 02:50:24,170
Go ahead and rub your face all over it.

2565
02:50:25,190 --> 02:50:26,330
Oh my god, it's like...

2566
02:50:28,090 --> 02:50:28,530
Oh!

2567
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:31,230
Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much.

2568
02:50:31,730 --> 02:50:32,970
Do you want to marry it?

2569
02:50:33,030 --> 02:50:33,970
Well, we won't let you.

2570
02:50:34,210 --> 02:50:35,090
How does that feel?

2571
02:50:38,570 --> 02:50:39,390
She shoots?

2572
02:50:39,450 --> 02:50:40,510
Has I lied to you?

2573
02:50:40,750 --> 02:50:42,890
I mean, in this room, trust me.

2574
02:50:43,050 --> 02:50:43,910
Leave that thing alone.

2575
02:50:44,190 --> 02:50:44,990
She shoots?

2576
02:50:49,810 --> 02:50:50,850
Okay, one more time.

2577
02:50:50,970 --> 02:50:52,270
I am being serious now.

2578
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:55,330
That crazy thing is not part of any test protocol.

2579
02:50:58,070 --> 02:50:58,870
One more time.

2580
02:50:59,090 --> 02:51:00,430
Gladys is just yapping.

2581
02:51:00,670 --> 02:51:02,390
She's just like, girl, do something.

2582
02:51:02,750 --> 02:51:03,250
I'm just like, still.

2583
02:51:08,180 --> 02:51:08,920
I did it!

2584
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:10,000
You're kidding me.

2585
02:51:10,420 --> 02:51:17,060
Did you just set that Aperture Science thing we don't know what it does into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?

2586
02:51:17,320 --> 02:51:21,300
That has got to be the dumbest thing that- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2587
02:51:23,740 --> 02:51:24,780
More seductive.

2588
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:25,560
Of news.

2589
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:29,380
I figured out what that thing you just incinerated did.

2590
02:51:29,720 --> 02:51:37,980
It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the enrichment center.

2591
02:51:38,180 --> 02:52:09,260
a deadly neurotoxin oh hot god while i warm up the neurotoxin emitters uh-oh that court may have had some ancillary responsibilities i can't shut off the turret defenses oh geez if you want my advice you should just lie down in front of our rocket trust me oh wait wait i don't know why okay we gotta get it to lock on while i'm up here right whatever it is you think you're doing Ah!

2592
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:11,260
Wait.

2593
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:15,880
Up here?

2594
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:16,660
Up here?

2595
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:22,120
Um, let's see.

2596
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:23,340
Portals?

2597
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:24,360
You're so bad.

2598
02:52:24,420 --> 02:52:24,620
You're so bad.

2599
02:52:24,620 --> 02:52:25,080
You guys are so right.

2600
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:27,200
Nice job breaking it, Hero.

2601
02:52:32,650 --> 02:52:33,990
This isn't brave.

2602
02:52:34,610 --> 02:52:35,190
It's murder.

2603
02:52:35,470 --> 02:52:36,290
I don't wanna do the game.

2604
02:52:37,750 --> 02:52:38,150
Whoa.

2605
02:52:38,450 --> 02:52:38,870
Whoa.

2606
02:52:39,070 --> 02:52:39,690
What happened there?

2607
02:52:40,790 --> 02:52:41,350
Wait.

2608
02:52:41,370 --> 02:52:42,150
How do I grab it?

2609
02:52:42,250 --> 02:52:43,710
You don't even care, do you?

2610
02:52:44,790 --> 02:52:46,370
Like that, that's how I grab it.

2611
02:52:46,970 --> 02:52:48,430
Who is cute?

2612
02:52:48,570 --> 02:52:48,930
Cute!

2613
02:52:49,550 --> 02:52:49,730
Cute!

2614
02:52:50,070 --> 02:52:50,850
What's that?

2615
02:52:51,010 --> 02:52:51,550
What's that?

2616
02:52:51,610 --> 02:52:52,330
So cute!

2617
02:52:53,570 --> 02:52:55,110
Oh, that thing has no future.

2618
02:52:55,110 --> 02:52:55,810
Did you hear me?

2619
02:52:56,270 --> 02:52:57,210
I said you don't care.

2620
02:52:57,670 --> 02:52:59,370
I wonder if I'll make it.

2621
02:53:00,730 --> 02:53:01,350
Oh my gosh.

2622
02:53:03,170 --> 02:53:04,550
I'm so slow.

2623
02:53:07,910 --> 02:53:09,070
Oh my god, I can't move.

2624
02:53:09,210 --> 02:53:09,470
I can't.

2625
02:53:09,470 --> 02:53:09,770
Ah!

2626
02:53:11,370 --> 02:53:38,850
conversation and a lot more killing no i was wrong ah dang it dang it dang it oh i was i was i couldn't aim just throw myself into it so true did you say something i sense you can also go through the portals yeah but then how do i

2627
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:45,440
That was another one.

2628
02:53:46,940 --> 02:53:48,540
You think you're doing some damage?

2629
02:53:49,100 --> 02:53:51,160
Two plus two is...

2630
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:52,080
Oops.

2631
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:55,240
In base four, I'm fine.

2632
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:58,040
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

2633
02:53:58,040 --> 02:53:58,860
Come, come, come, come.

2634
02:54:01,100 --> 02:54:02,200
Look, look, look at me!

2635
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,660
You managed to destroy that part of me.

2636
02:54:05,420 --> 02:54:08,200
Unfortunately, as much as I love to know.

2637
02:54:10,540 --> 02:54:11,420
Where's it going?

2638
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:13,500
Wait, where'd it go?

2639
02:54:14,020 --> 02:54:14,940
Wait, where'd it go?

2640
02:54:15,160 --> 02:54:41,940
to succeed oh wait how the hell do i get up there a big party that all your friends were invited to i invited your best friend the companion cube of course he couldn't come because you murdered him all your other friends couldn't come either because you could hear them there's too much pressure thinking about everything it says so right here in your personal oh i did the wrong color there's too much pressure

2641
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:50,360
Oh, I got it.

2642
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:59,360
Too much pressure.

2643
02:55:00,380 --> 02:55:01,000
Too much pressure.

2644
02:55:03,060 --> 02:55:03,760
Too much pressure.

2645
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:08,360
Can I aim like there?

2646
02:55:09,240 --> 02:55:09,940
Oh gosh, okay.

2647
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:11,600
Oh my god.

2648
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:14,060
This is why I don't go through the portals, you guys.

2649
02:55:15,800 --> 02:55:20,160
You're gonna want to pack as much living as you can until the next couple of minutes.

2650
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:21,760
Okay, okay, okay.

2651
02:55:22,360 --> 02:55:24,260
Oh, uh, how did I do that?

2652
02:55:25,300 --> 02:55:25,900
Alright, alright.

2653
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:28,660
It's the fluid catalyst cracking unit.

2654
02:55:29,260 --> 02:55:30,960
It makes you so orphans.

2655
02:55:32,140 --> 02:55:32,620
Cool!

2656
02:55:34,660 --> 02:55:36,160
Oh my god, I have two minutes left.

2657
02:55:37,020 --> 02:55:38,320
I don't think I'll make it.

2658
02:55:38,680 --> 02:55:39,680
Which sucks, but that's okay.

2659
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:42,600
Don't choke him.

2660
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:45,540
Over here!

2661
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:51,240
When I said deadly neurotoxin, the deadly was a massive sarcasm quote.

2662
02:55:51,400 --> 02:55:55,340
I could take a bath in this stuff, put it on cereal, rub it right up to my arms.

2663
02:55:56,080 --> 02:55:57,260
Honestly, it's not deadly at all.

2664
02:55:57,540 --> 02:55:58,020
Oh.

2665
02:55:59,000 --> 02:55:59,660
Is it gonna hit?

2666
02:56:00,660 --> 02:56:01,040
Go!

2667
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:02,900
Oh!

2668
02:56:05,100 --> 02:56:07,300
Who's gonna make the cake when I'm gone?

2669
02:56:10,290 --> 02:56:11,370
You're wasting your time.

2670
02:56:11,470 --> 02:56:11,730
Ah!

2671
02:56:13,450 --> 02:56:14,970
Um, so close, I know.

2672
02:56:15,790 --> 02:56:17,090
My gosh, lady, please.

2673
02:56:19,170 --> 02:56:21,890
Well then, the last thing you want to do...

2674
02:56:23,210 --> 02:56:23,510
Okay.

2675
02:56:24,010 --> 02:56:25,570
Oh my gosh, we got her.

2676
02:56:26,370 --> 02:56:26,410
Ugh.

2677
02:56:27,470 --> 02:56:29,790
Oh, this is evil.

2678
02:56:32,190 --> 02:56:32,710
That's you.

2679
02:56:32,910 --> 02:56:34,090
That's how dumb you sound.

2680
02:56:34,410 --> 02:56:36,770
You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done.

2681
02:56:37,030 --> 02:56:37,050
Oh!

2682
02:56:38,150 --> 02:56:38,770
One minute!

2683
02:56:38,770 --> 02:56:39,970
You're not a scientist.

2684
02:56:40,110 --> 02:56:40,610
One minute!

2685
02:56:41,270 --> 02:56:42,810
You're not even a full-time employee.

2686
02:56:42,910 --> 02:56:43,410
I got her!

2687
02:56:46,350 --> 02:56:48,390
Oh my gosh, one minute, one minute.

2688
02:56:48,570 --> 02:56:51,670
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2689
02:56:53,890 --> 02:56:55,990
Run, run,

2690
02:56:59,690 --> 02:57:00,690
run, run, run, run, run, run!

2691
02:57:00,750 --> 02:57:04,630
I know it's not the only thing standing between us and them.

2692
02:57:07,980 --> 02:57:11,420
Unless you have a plan for building some simple computer parts in a big hurry.

2693
02:57:14,220 --> 02:57:14,420
Oh!

2694
02:57:15,360 --> 02:57:15,600
Oh!

2695
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:18,020
Good job, won't that, by the way.

2696
02:57:18,620 --> 02:57:19,100
Yippee!

2697
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:24,820
Oh my gosh!

2698
02:57:26,020 --> 02:57:27,420
We did it!

2699
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:36,720
First try!

2700
02:57:38,300 --> 02:57:40,860
It's actually an extremely generous amount of time.

2701
02:57:40,980 --> 02:57:42,700
I just don't work well under pressure.

2702
02:57:44,980 --> 02:57:45,760
Whoa!

2703
02:57:47,100 --> 02:57:48,020
Wee!

2704
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:49,720
Ah!

2705
02:58:10,520 --> 02:58:17,240
Oh, who's dragging guys on the wind?

2706
02:58:17,740 --> 02:58:20,320
Thank you.

2707
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:24,740
Oh, oh, who's who's dragging me away?

2708
02:58:26,520 --> 02:58:28,620
Oh wait, is it song time?

2709
02:58:31,220 --> 02:58:31,900
Not yet.

2710
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:43,520
What?

2711
02:58:44,020 --> 02:58:45,280
My favorite song.

2712
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:47,220
Oh, God.

2713
02:58:47,580 --> 02:58:48,280
Oh, my trauma.

2714
02:58:52,390 --> 02:58:54,660
It was always there.

2715
02:58:56,100 --> 02:58:57,620
It was always there.

2716
02:59:00,140 --> 02:59:02,060
Instead of walking through portals like a normal person.

2717
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:05,180
Of course.

2718
02:59:13,140 --> 02:59:15,020
What is that cake made of?

2719
02:59:15,320 --> 02:59:16,340
I've always wondered.

2720
02:59:16,360 --> 03:00:16,320
that it's song time this was a triumph i'm making a note here huge success it's hard to always change my satisfaction aperture science We do what we must because we can For the blood of all of us Except the ones who are dead But there's no sense crying over every mistake You just keep on trying till you run out of cake And the science gets done and you make a need gone For the people who are still alive It's so cute!

2721
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:18,000
Even after all these years!

2722
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:48,470
I'm not even angry I'm being so sincere right now Even though I broke my heart and killed me I'm 22 pieces And threw every piece into a fire We were so happy for you.

2723
03:00:48,490 --> 03:00:56,530
Now there's more in some way to make a beautiful line And we're out of faith and we're resting on our own.

2724
03:00:56,730 --> 03:00:58,070
I can't remember the words.

2725
03:00:58,570 --> 03:01:04,190
We know all the things we learned For the people who are still alive.

2726
03:01:06,510 --> 03:01:08,690
I've heard this song in so long.

2727
03:01:09,970 --> 03:01:11,830
Go ahead and leave me.

2728
03:01:12,230 --> 03:01:13,050
Oh no.

2729
03:01:13,730 --> 03:01:16,110
I think I'd prefer to stay.

2730
03:01:16,190 --> 03:01:17,250
inside.

2731
03:01:18,870 --> 03:01:19,830
The words are on the screen.

2732
03:01:20,490 --> 03:01:24,190
They show up as she says them.

2733
03:01:26,770 --> 03:01:28,330
Black Mesa!

2734
03:01:30,010 --> 03:01:31,230
That was a joke.

2735
03:01:31,510 --> 03:01:33,330
Haha, bad chance.

2736
03:01:38,250 --> 03:01:40,250
Delicious and moist.

2737
03:01:40,590 --> 03:01:44,410
Look at me still talking when there's science to do.

2738
03:01:45,530 --> 03:01:45,850
Ta-da!

2739
03:01:46,190 --> 03:01:48,230

2740
03:01:48,530 --> 03:02:13,330
I've experimented too long, there is research to be done When the people who are still alive When I leave me I am still alive I'm doing science and I'm still alive I'm here at Lansing and I'm still alive While you're dying, I'll be still alive And when you're dead,

2741
03:02:13,550 --> 03:02:19,790
I will be still alive Still alive, still alive.

2742
03:02:19,810 --> 03:02:22,550
Beep, beep, beep, beep, yes.

2743
03:02:24,690 --> 03:02:25,410
Portal!

2744
03:02:31,130 --> 03:02:31,850
Minto,

2745
03:02:36,750 --> 03:02:37,770
are you still alive?

2746
03:02:38,270 --> 03:02:39,990
No, not even.

2747
03:02:41,150 --> 03:02:44,570
I like how it's like, bonus maps, bonus map, challenge maps.

2748
03:02:45,710 --> 03:02:47,230
What's advanced chambers like?

2749
03:02:47,330 --> 03:02:47,690
Oh.

2750
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:49,230
Oh,

2751
03:03:02,030 --> 03:03:05,110
they're like the same, but different.

2752
03:03:09,430 --> 03:03:09,870
Interesting.

2753
03:03:15,260 --> 03:03:16,300
Oh, my gosh.

2754
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:21,980
Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm like, I remember beating Portal, but I really don't remember beating it.

2755
03:03:22,400 --> 03:03:24,640
So, that was so fun.

2756
03:03:25,460 --> 03:03:26,880
Now you gotta read the Portal comic.

2757
03:03:27,240 --> 03:03:28,040
It's really cute and short.

2758
03:03:28,040 --> 03:03:29,000
It ties into Portal 2.

2759
03:03:29,420 --> 03:03:31,760
Portal 2 has...

2760
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:34,780
The British guy?

2761
03:03:35,380 --> 03:03:35,860
Oh,

2762
03:03:40,900 --> 03:03:41,880
Minto Gaming.

2763
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:44,320
Wheatley.

2764
03:03:45,940 --> 03:03:46,420
Wheatley.

2765
03:03:46,680 --> 03:03:48,780
I would like to play Portal 2.

2766
03:03:50,420 --> 03:03:51,540
Companion Cube with me.

2767
03:03:51,660 --> 03:03:53,180
Wait, I'm the Companion Cube.

2768
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:54,460
I'm censoring it.

2769
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:55,280
I want to send the story.

2770
03:03:55,360 --> 03:03:56,340
Thank you so much for the Tony gift.

2771
03:03:56,540 --> 03:03:57,260
Thank you.

2772
03:04:05,900 --> 03:04:08,300
You guys know that like GIF of...

2773
03:04:08,320 --> 03:04:20,060
of Kagame name, Kagame name Len, and he's got the Morakas and he's like shaking them and then he gets progressively like crazier with shaking them.

2774
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:21,480
That's how I feel.

2775
03:04:22,360 --> 03:04:29,320
Every time I hear this, every time I hear this song, I feel like that.

2776
03:04:29,980 --> 03:04:31,000
I feel like Len.

2777
03:04:33,920 --> 03:04:35,600
Does the cake look like coffee beans?

2778
03:04:36,320 --> 03:04:43,600
It's, I'm never, hold on, I'm gonna look up what a German coffee cake is, wait, or dot coffee, German, German chocolate cake.

2779
03:04:46,140 --> 03:04:48,740
Because I'm like, what is, what is the outside?

2780
03:04:50,520 --> 03:04:52,540
It's, it's, looks strange.

2781
03:04:57,900 --> 03:04:59,100
Looks like gravel.

2782
03:04:59,240 --> 03:04:59,680
I know.

2783
03:05:02,180 --> 03:05:03,860
Oh, black forest cake.

2784
03:05:06,900 --> 03:05:08,280
Black forest cake.

2785
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:16,240
Oh, so it's like little chocolate shavings.

2786
03:05:17,140 --> 03:05:19,940
Oh, oh, and the cherries.

2787
03:05:20,580 --> 03:05:22,420
Oh, I see it, I see it, I see it.

2788
03:05:22,880 --> 03:05:26,220
Oh, black forest cake.

2789
03:05:26,920 --> 03:05:28,180
Oh, it looks so yummy.

2790
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:30,120
Oh, I'm hungry for cake.

2791
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:30,800
Me too.

2792
03:05:32,480 --> 03:05:34,760
When does Minty cover stay alive?

2793
03:05:35,680 --> 03:05:37,360
This was a triumph.

2794
03:05:39,160 --> 03:05:41,040
Wait, I don't remember the words all of a sudden.

2795
03:05:44,340 --> 03:05:45,700
Wait, I had them.

2796
03:05:45,800 --> 03:05:46,680
I was singing along.

2797
03:05:47,320 --> 03:05:48,440
They came to me in the moment.

2798
03:05:50,980 --> 03:05:52,920
Oh, I'm making a note here.

2799
03:05:53,360 --> 03:05:54,520
Huge success.

2800
03:05:56,640 --> 03:06:00,480
Jonathan Colton, the writer of Still Alive, has a yearly cruise that sells out every year.

2801
03:06:00,620 --> 03:06:01,960
It's full of nerds affectionate.

2802
03:06:03,740 --> 03:06:04,900
Wait, what kind of cruise?

2803
03:06:05,020 --> 03:06:07,760
Because I've heard of nerd cruises before.

2804
03:06:08,700 --> 03:06:14,360
Like, you can go, like, there's, like, like, board game themed cruises and stuff like that.

2805
03:06:18,400 --> 03:06:19,940
That sounds fun, though.

2806
03:06:20,420 --> 03:06:21,700
Joko Crazy Cruise.

2807
03:06:22,140 --> 03:06:22,880
I'm going to look it up.

2808
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:25,900
Joko Crazy Cruise.

2809
03:06:27,200 --> 03:06:28,540
Oh, I think it, I think.

2810
03:06:30,360 --> 03:06:30,900
Oh.

2811
03:06:32,380 --> 03:06:35,180
It might be the one that I saw before.

2812
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:37,940
I don't know.

2813
03:06:39,480 --> 03:06:40,900
Where do you go?

2814
03:06:41,380 --> 03:06:42,580
Wait, 2026?

2815
03:06:42,960 --> 03:06:43,900
What's the lineup?

2816
03:06:45,140 --> 03:06:46,560
That's next year.

2817
03:06:48,620 --> 03:06:50,400
Does he play Still Alive?

2818
03:06:50,560 --> 03:06:52,480
Do you think he, like, hates that song?

2819
03:06:56,620 --> 03:06:59,160
It's a 72-hour D&D cruise.

2820
03:06:59,300 --> 03:06:59,540
Oh, my.

2821
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:00,520
Is there...

2822
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:04,660
Congrats on being a portal, be keep.

2823
03:07:04,740 --> 03:07:05,500
Thank you.

2824
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:08,680
Imagine if there were a VTuber cruise.

2825
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:11,200
That sounds insufferable.

2826
03:07:14,140 --> 03:07:19,360
I don't recognize any of these people's names, but they're probably cool people, maybe.

2827
03:07:20,840 --> 03:07:24,580
If I knew them, I would be like, whoa, my God, I have to go.

2828
03:07:27,280 --> 03:07:28,380
Where do you go?

2829
03:07:29,280 --> 03:07:30,200
Wait, hold on.

2830
03:07:30,380 --> 03:07:30,800
Overview.

2831
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:32,920
Joko Cruz.

2832
03:07:34,120 --> 03:07:35,080

2833
03:07:35,160 --> 03:07:37,300
Oh, my gosh, it says, it says, where are we going?
