00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,650

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,290

Wow.

00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,200
Wow.

45
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,120
It's not like it's her stream or anything.

46
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,480
I can't believe she's telling you first.

47
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,440
I should have the honors.

48
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,720
It's about Metal Gear.

49
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,380
It's nice meeting you.

50
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,500
Weebsie!

51
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,540
Thanks for coming to see me yesterday.

52
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,280
I know she'll try and rage bait you.

53
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,020
Absolutely.

54
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:42,900
Because I know even more so that she'll try to because
because yesterday she was singing and I accidentally put a

55
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:53,960
beard over her face while she was singing like I was trying
to put it on me and for some reason it kept going on her.

56
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:07,820
I retweeted it It was accidental It really was But like It
looked so funny

57
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:19,930
Finally playing something more confusing than the games I
star And kept me waiting Huey Thanks for blessing us with

58
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,930
Santo Minto last night The cafe was so much fun Hope my MVP
art makes its way to your cafe Yeah!

59
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:35,740
Take care of us give it yeah they said that they will send
us everything so miss games have some of my favorite video

60
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:44,560
game music there's nothing at the moment there's no sound
it's so quiet um i picked the masterpiece edition um i

61
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:52,760
didn't i was like so you know when you like search a game on
steam why is it that when i search game hold on i'm going to

62
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:01,000
steam right now okay good i search mist and it comes up with
mist and then like four other random games that have nothing

63
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:13,730
to do with mist and so i didn't realize that this version
was on steam so i actually bought the i bought the 3d remake

64
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,610
but then at the same time i was just like oh i don't i i did
not do my due diligence And then I did not research which

65
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,710
port was the best or whatever.

66
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,770
So I was like, yeah, there's a VR version of this game.

67
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,730
That's, yeah, there's a mini golf.

68
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,450
I bought, no, I did not buy that one.

69
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,790
This is a game I remember watching my dad play.

70
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,650
Me too.

71
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:39,850
I know.

72
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,390
I was like, I'm gonna, I would play it.

73
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,010
And when I was a Wii Wisp, I would play it.

74
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,730
And then I don't think I...

75
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:57,110
made literally any progress at all which makes complete
sense because i was an idiot child so cool to meet you and

76
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,050
talk to you about all the idle stuff i got into because you
yeah

77
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:18,750
so much thank you thank you thank you thank you so yeah
we're gonna try and be the same now i am idiot adult uh

78
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,550
hopefully we can get through as much as possible without a
walkthrough.

79
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,670
We'll see.

80
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,410
We'll try.

81
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,810
Let's just start again.

82
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,570
Oh my god!

83
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,350
Mystery.

84
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,030
I realized the moment I fell into the fissure that the book
would not be destroyed as I had planned.

85
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,010
It continued falling into that starry expanse of which I had
only a fleeting cliff.

86
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,350
There's a story to this?

87
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,390
I've tried to speculate where it might have landed.

88
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,630
I must admit, however, such a conjecture is futile.

89
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,670
Still, questions about whose hands might one day hold my
misdemeanor are unsettling to me.

90
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,190
Straw, happy birthday!

91
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,930
I know my apprehensions might never be allayed.

92
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,590
And so I close.

93
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,330
Happy happy birthday!

94
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,330
Realizing that perhaps the ending has not yet been written.

95
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,670
Look.

96
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,160
Moust.

97
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,320
Open.

98
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,540
Open.

99
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what?

100
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,440
Open.

101
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,220
Missed.

102
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,100
Whoa.

103
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,600
Whoa.

104
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,020
That's all bored.

105
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,300
Whoa.

106
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,520
Oh, no.

107
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,460
Oh my gosh, point and click adventure.

108
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Here we go, baby.

109
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,980
No.

110
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,440
We got the forest.

111
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,640
Ooh, we got something in the forest.

112
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
We've got a secret layer.

113
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,760
Oh.

114
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,420
We have a completely silent pot.

115
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Just kidding.

116
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,680
This makes total sense.

117
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,670
Why can't I interact with it?

118
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,190
Interesting.

119
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,990
What's this?

120
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,010
Oh, what's this?

121
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:47,090
Settings, dimensional imager, topographical extrusion test,
water turbulent pool, marker switch diagram.

122
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:21,470
I can, okay, that's why it's on our water turbulent pool.

123
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,450
The reveal was...

124
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,650
Let's try 40.

125
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,630
Let's try 40.

126
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,590
Oh.

127
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,450
Wow, how inconvenient.

128
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,750
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

129
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,130
It was too funny.

130
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,810
It was like the only time I've ever been funny to me.

131
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,570
Game was ahead of its time.

132
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,670
Oh, mountains!

133
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,190
Nice.

134
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,590
Let's see what else we got.

135
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,850
47.

136
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,370
Marker switch diagram.

137
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,850
47.

138
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,050
So this is...

139
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Oh, okay.

140
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:31,920
Whoa.

141
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,380
This is the marker switch.

142
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,980
Whatever that is.

143
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,540
Hey, girl, playing this with my daughter gave me a huge love
for pre-rendered graphics and is a large reason why I got

144
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,280
into FNAF.

145
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,200
Missed a FNAF pipeline.

146
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,000
Only you.

147
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,780
Otto, welcome to membership.

148
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,380
Thank you so much.

149
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,380
Thank you so much, Pep Member.

150
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,060
The Super Chat.

151
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,860
Thank you.

152
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,580
All right.

153
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,980
I'm clicking on everything.

154
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,680
I'm clicking on everything.

155
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,100
Oh!

156
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,580
That's the switch!

157
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,120
The count of the dimes in the super chat says it all.

158
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,400
The number calls you from back in time.

159
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,920
No!

160
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,820
Let's see what's going on over here.

161
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,560
What's this?

162
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,560
Catherine.

163
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,840
I've left for you a message of utmost importance in our four
chamber beside the dock.

164
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,220
Remember the number of marker switches on this island into
the...

165
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,040
Oh, oh, enter the number of markers marker switches on this
island into the imager to retrieve the message.

166
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,740
Yours, Atrus.

167
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,740
Okay.

168
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,020
Atrus.

169
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,900
Okay, we have one.

170
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,840
We have two.

171
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,580
The dentist!

172
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,040
Do not.

173
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay, for right now.

174
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,040
The dock near the where-where?

175
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay, we have three.

176
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,440
None of them do anything yet.

177
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,480
The island can't be that big, right?

178
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,940
Oh my god, this is all so nostalgic.

179
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,900
What's that?

180
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay, I'm...

181
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,440
Oh, I accidentally did something.

182
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,580
I wish Limbo of the Lost was easier to run.

183
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,320
Let me watch it go through that insanity, yeah?

184
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,640
Wait, how do I get out of here?

185
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,780
I accidentally did something.

186
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,660
QR code.

187
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,770
Oh.

188
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:56,850
Oh.

189
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,430
I did something.

190
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,610
I was yesterday's tree, but I was busy getting older.

191
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,170
Set up fold!

192
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,250
Happy birthday!

193
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,910
Happy, happy birthday!

194
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,790
Oh my god, it's a man!

195
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,770
Who are you?

196
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,390
Bring me a legend.

197
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,610
I

198
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,030
have seen you.

199
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,970
You don't let me get too much.

200
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,530
I can make a break for you.

201
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:42,170
Shh.

202
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,530
Huh?

203
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,850
What's he saying?

204
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,610
I am serious.

205
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,190
He's serious.

206
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,750
Or he's Siri.

207
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,270
He's Siri.

208
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,710
It's like the longest video ever.

209
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,290
My man's uploading his video on McDonald's Wi-Fi.

210
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,010
Come on!

211
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,710
Oh!

212
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,130
I feel like this is just one of those games where it's like
a thing will happen.

213
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,450
I don't want to go in there just quite yet.

214
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,610
Thing happened and you're like...

215
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,850
Oh, wait, did I just crawl through a... wait.

216
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,320
Oh, I think I'm waiting.

217
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,060
Oh, is this a hiding spot?

218
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,640
Wait, I can't like die or anything in this, can I?

219
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,790
Wait, this is a...

220
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,310
I saw you guys mentioning red pages, but then we have blue
page.

221
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,110
Oh god, not this again.

222
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,490
Serious?

223
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,450
Serious?

224
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,770
Amigo!

225
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,390
Serious?

226
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,880
Help me.

227
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,880
Blue pages.

228
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
Blue pages.

229
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,300
Blue pages.

230
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,530
What if all my streams were like this, you guys?

231
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,190
This is how I feel like my streams are gonna look like if I
stream out of a hotel.

232
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,830
What are these?

233
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,230
That's an off...

234
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,110
Ostrich?

235
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,050
Green.

236
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,050
Or red.

237
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,150
What the hell?

238
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,530
Maple Leaf.

239
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,410
Wait, that's another switch.

240
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,700
Okay.

241
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,940
Oh my gosh, there's already so many choices.

242
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,920
Which Teletubby's belly did they sacrifice to make these
books?

243
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,460
So I see that we are going to...

244
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,620

other png games you played had more of a setup for motive um

There's another one.

252
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,640
Okay.

253
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
What else we got around here?

254
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,400
Something this way?

255
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,460
The spaceship!

256
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,770
Can I get electrocuted?

257
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,350
I guess we're trying to power up that bad boy.

258
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,400
Is that all of them?

259
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,060
So far?

260
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,480
Oh, we forgot to go back into the dentist office.

261
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,420
Well, I didn't forget it.

262
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,240
I just didn't want to.

263
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,220
What?

264
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,520
January 1st.

265
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,020
I don't know about Electro, but you're definitely cute.

266
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,760
Guys, you want to guess what today's drink of choices?

267
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,400
You want to guess?

268
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,630
Water.

269
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,090
Vodka.

270
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,670
Close.

271
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,340
I saw someone say it.

272
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,270
I saw someone say it.

273
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,870
Today's drink of choices.

274
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,850
Everybody's saying Dr. Peppy.

275
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,630
Yeah, I can't have soda.

276
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,990
I can't have soda.

277
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,050
It's the drink of the day is...

278
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,910
Hot chocolate!

279
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,850
Oh my gosh, it's so cold.

280
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,030
And I probably should put on my sweater, but I'm still...

281
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,250
Stupid.

282
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,190
I want her to show off my tummy.

283
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,170
So...

284
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
How is that close to vodka?

285
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,540
Guilty pleasure.

286
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,520
Some of these beeping sounds.

287
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,300
Oh, here we go.

288
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,820
Let's go to my birthday.

289
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,820
October 1st.

290
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,460
Wow!

291
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,160
Square.

292
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,660
Ugh.

293
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,220
Let's see.

294
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,980
Let's go at it.

295
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,480
Wait, what is 20?

296
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,680
Wait, what?

297
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,840
What does this mean?

298
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,100
Is this the year?

299
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,610
Whoa!

300
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,740
Neat.

301
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,060
Was there anything else in here?

302
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
I thought it was a dentist office.

303
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,460
It's actually awesome.

304
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,220
Okay, what was this again?

305
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,860
Enter the number of marker switches on this island into the
imager to retrieve the message.

306
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,360
I'm guessing that place where we could...

307
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
So how many were there?

308
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,820
One.

309
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,060
Two.

310
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,080
What if there's like one hidden in these caves, you know?

311
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,240
Like I didn't go in here yet.

312
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,620
We'll go back, I guess.

313
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,490
Did you see the one by the clock tower?

314
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,050
I did, but I didn't count it because I lost track, so I
stopped counting.

315
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,130
Library!

316
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,600
Where is it?

317
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:11,880
Oh.

318
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,680
You can brute force the number pretty easily?

319
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,620
I believe that.

320
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,580
Oh, oh, oh.

321
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,160
Oh, clicking too fast.

322
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,460
Pretty sure, originally, you had to manually close the door
for the elevator to work.

323
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,060
Quality of life updates.

324
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,680
Woohoo!

325
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,420
Okay, interesting.

326
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,360
Okay, send us back home.

327
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,190
There's so many things going on.

328
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,890
So many things we can do.

329
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,290
Okay.

330
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,570
Wait, please let me out.

331
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,230
There we go.

332
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:05,290
Alright.

333
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:17,830
Let me go re- Okay, it was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?

334
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:18,730
Maybe?

335
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,510
6 of them?

336
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,990
Only 6 of them?

337
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,910
I see it.

338
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,670
Six of them.

339
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,350
I won't say...

340
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,770
Let's try...

341
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,330
The number above that.

342
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,390
Let's try the number above that.

343
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,770
Nothing.

344
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,280
I know your games.

345
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,080
Eight?

346
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,240
Brute force it.

347
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,960
Yeah, baby, we're brute forcing it.

348
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,220
Oh!

349
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,140
Catherine, my love.

350
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,660
I have to leave Woodley.

351
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,460
Something terrible has happened.

352
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,460
It's hard for me to believe.

353
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
Most of my books have been destroyed.

354
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,680
Catherine, it's one of our sons.

355
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,100
I suspect Akinah, but I shouldn't lead to conclusions.

356
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,380
I'll find him and Siris as well.

357
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I should have known better than O'Leary.

358
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:06,560
left my library unchecked for so long well i've removed the
remaining undamaged books from the library and placed them

359
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:16,500
in the places of protection okay shouldn't have to use the
books until i return but if you've forgotten the access keys

360
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:26,180

everything will be fine i'll see you shortly oh and erase

361
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,480
this message after reviewed it just to be safe.

362
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:29,700
Uh-oh.

363
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,660
Catherine, you had one job.

364
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,040
Catherine.

365
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,020
Also, the guy just left the note, like, in the middle of the
island.

366
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,180
Anybody could read it and figure it out, like I did.

367
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,040
What was it?

368
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,980
Oh, okay.

369
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,400
Just kidding.

370
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,080
The something rotation?

371
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,880
What did he say?

372
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,240
The towel rotation?

373
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,660
He's like, be careful, Catherine.

374
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:19,380
this message don't let anybody know except you know snake
what's this abbo there's so many things here okay

375
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,120
what's this one even arrow

376
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,860
like a stone building in here.

377
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
Maybe I was crazy though.

378
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,860
So what was what did he say?

379
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,160
Tower rotation.

380
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,720
Maybe Catherine never saw it.

381
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,760
That's what I'm thinking.

382
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,050
There was this to the power.

383
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,250
Do you think it's also just trial and error to power the
spaceship?

384
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,390
And then what was here.

385
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,230
Oh, that was just another power thing.

386
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:16,650
Hmm.

387
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,230
I'll be having a good day.

388
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,030
Thank you.

389
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,170
Thank you.

390
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,070
Mystical greetings, Minto.

391
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:24,870
Hello.

392
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,080
Nothing needs to be trial and error in this game.

393
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,580
Trial and error is a choice.

394
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Okay.

395
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,540
My urge to backseat.

396
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,520
Don't worry, your time will come.

397
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,600
Eventually.

398
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:40,940
Eventually.

399
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,600
I will I will ask for clues and hints.

400
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,060
Don't you worry.

401
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,280
Your sweet little head where you're like, I must tell her
what to do.

402
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,500
I must tell the VTuber where to go.

403
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,420
And how to progress.

404
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,020
Your time will come.

405
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,800
Flamingo.

406
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,880
Oh, okay.

407
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,180
There's also...

408
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,660
What else?

409
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,020
This thing over here.

410
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,320
Can I touch it?

411
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,100
Oh, no.

412
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,680
It has a mysterious aura.

413
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,140
By aura, just like a crazy soundtrack.

414
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,130
Every time I try to click on something, it, like, takes me
off the screen.

415
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,270
All of these sound effects are etched into my brain.

416
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,350
I wonder what these switches do.

417
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,430
Let's go back in here.

418
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:00,770
Open.

419
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,540
Maybe in here.

420
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,780
The library.

421
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,600
Open Sesame.

422
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,280
I haven't seen this game since I was a kid.

423
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,680
Your guess is as good as mine.

424
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,520
I don't know what I did.

425
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,060
I definitely played this as a kid.

426
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,700
But I have no idea, like, what I...

427
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,860
I did, you know what I mean?

428
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I think I literally just clicked around in this specific
area and that was it.

429
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,060
Oh!

430
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:42,760
Oh!

431
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,860
Oh, ho, ho!

432
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,020
Okay.

433
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,300
Uh-huh.

434
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,460
Is there anything that I can do with this?

435
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:02,760
No?

436
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,760
Hmm.

437
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,660
Hmm.

438
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,820
Hmm.

439
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,320
But now we have this one, which is...

440
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,400
Okay, I couldn't tell...

441
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,940
I still can't tell what it is.

442
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,560
It looks like there's something here, but it's so dark.

443
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,810
Yeah, a book ladder and a key ladder.

444
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,160
Okay, well, there was more stuff in here, but it is still
also mysterious.

445
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,290
Oh, tower rotation!

446
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,730
Wait, where was that?

447
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,390
That's right.

448
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,570
That was a thing.

449
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,550
Oh, I remember.

450
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,090
I remember.

451
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,050
We probably need to rotate the tower until we can...

452
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,870
Oh, thank you.

453
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,850
I completely forgot about that because it was so loud.

454
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,030
I'll turn it back down again.

455
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,250
Oh.

456
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,190
Okay.

457
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,070
Oh, games, we won't even tell you what the puzzle is.

458
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,530
Walkabout mini golf has a level.

459
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,230
I know!

460
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,110
I know!

461
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,930
Based on mis-imagine having to solve the puzzles and score
under par.

462
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,870
Oh, heck no.

463
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,720
That turns a lot faster than I remember.

464
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,680
I didn't mean to turn it so much, but maybe a dramatic turn
is what we needed.

465
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,780
Tell me it made a difference.

466
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,420
Did it make no difference?

467
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,960
It made no difference.

468
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,880
You're looking at a different part of the wall.

469
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,240
Yeah, of course.

470
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,220
Alright, let's see.

471
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,120
We go back.

472
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,300
Oh, I think I let go.

473
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,420
Maybe like if I'm looking at this building, you know.

474
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,740
It sounds so scary.

475
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,060
Like it sounds too rickety.

476
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,520
To the library!

477
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,620
Almost at the finding the puzzle stage.

478
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,250
Hi Mint, hello!

479
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,350
Okay.

480
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,650
That still looks the same.

481
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,270
Oh, it still looks the same.

482
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,940
Is there something I'm missing?

483
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,940
Is this something I'm missing for the tower rotation?

484
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,790
Yes.

485
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,410
Oh, okay, okay.

486
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,850
The first puzzle is to find the puzzle.

487
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,120
Let's see.

488
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,560
Open!

489
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,260
Are any switches on?

490
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,480
No.

491
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,760
Time to flip some switch.

492
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,580
Oh, we'll start with the rocket switch.

493
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,220
All right.

494
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,900
All right.

495
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,660
All right.

496
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,180
Oh, right.

497
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,440
Flip them all, flip.

498
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,640
We'll do those three.

499
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:50,820
Yeah.

500
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,320
Wait.

501
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,260
Check this again.

502
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,200
I think

503
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,440
we need to flip more switches.

504
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,320
I think

505
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,810
we need a...

506
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,550
Sorry if like my erratic clicking is...

507
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,470
But this, the one over at the clock tower...

508
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,910
We cannot get just yet.

509
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,960
The book and the key...

510
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,210
Oh!

511
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:51,890
Oh!

512
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,490
Wait, wait, wait, what was that?

513
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,570
Oh!

514
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,290
Okay, interesting.

515
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,390
Oh, okay, okay.

516
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,110
I hope it rotated properly.

517
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,400
What is it?

518
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,640
What will it reveal?

519
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,060
Oh, nothing.

520
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,960
I'm too fast, too furious.

521
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,070
Have you checked the books on the bookshelf?

522
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:36,690
Yeah!

523
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,140
Oh, oh, what's that?

524
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,540
2.40.

525
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,480
2.2.

526
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:56,500
What?

527
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,860
That must be the stars?

528
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,680
Right?

529
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,240
Oh, gosh.

530
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,240
Am I going to need paper?

531
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,960
Uh-oh.

532
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,300
Okay, all right.

533
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,640
All right.

534
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,080
Hold on.

535
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,360
Let me...

536
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,680
Notepad.

537
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,120
Notepad.

538
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,140
So this is, um, the...

539
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,540
Um, what are those called?

540
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,160
Oh my god.

541
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,060
I just, my brain, my brain wants to call it a big clank.

542
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,280
2, 42, 2, 1.

543
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:32,840
Gear, yeah.

544
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,780
Oh, duh, is the metal gear.

545
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,860
Such a nice view of those metal gears.

546
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,980
My brain just wants to call it a big clank.

547
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,180
Why?

548
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,820
Don't worry about it.

549
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,560
Why could I not remember Metal Gear?

550
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,500
That's the worst thing ever!

551
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,200
Oh my god.

552
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,680
You know them big clanks?

553
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,060
I mean they do make a clanky noise, no?

554
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,180
Mado Misto.

555
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,220
Me dominto of the island of Misto, what is your wisdom of
the day?

556
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,020
Big then go Clank.

557
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,080
Okay.

558
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,300
For now, we'll get...

559
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,020
So this is the sunken ship.

560
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,780
For now, I'll just start writing these down.

561
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,260
And then once I leave, I'll observe the bookshelf.

562
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,060
My favorite franchise, Big Clank Solid.

563
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,900
Minto going to the big clank.

564
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,480
What did she do?

565
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,960
Good plan?

566
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,740
Okay, cool.

567
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,360
Glad you guys agree.

568
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,280
Yes, that's the sunken ship.

569
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,700
I like when you start doing things, the music starts
playing.

570
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

571
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:25,480
October 11th, 1984, 10.04 a.m.

572
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:34,960
January 17, 12, 07, 5, 46 a.m.

573
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,140
You guys want to know what all these times are?

574
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,460
November 23rd, 979, 9791.

575
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,180
6, 57 p.m.

576
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,080
They're all times I met with your mother.

577
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,390
It's the streamings again.

578
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:11,290
Okay guys, see you in 9791!

579
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,780
Sick bird.

580
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,300
Thank you.

581
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,750
Alright, next one.

582
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,410
Wait, what about this guy though?

583
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,610
Sorry, I know it's a terrible sound.

584
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,850
So it's only the three?

585
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,170
Sappy Vinto is my dad.

586
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,030
Oh, I keep clicking out of the game for some reason.

587
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,950
Okay.

588
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,710
Alright guys, we're using our brains today.

589
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,290
This one is the spaceship.

590
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,410
Let's see what the spaceship has to offer for us.

591
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,650
It should be more than three.

592
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,490
Well, we don't have one unlocked at the moment.

593
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,690
So, oh my gosh.

594
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,970
Sometimes point and click is so frustrating.

595
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,090
Okay, there we go.

596
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:26,210
Just make it sure.

597
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,860
59 volts!

598
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:33,960
Okay.

599
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,080
That sounds like something we need to know to power that
baby.

600
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,520
Power that baby.

601
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,760
Power that baby.

602
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,470
Are

603
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,940
you writing these down?

604
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,560
I am!

605
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,120
I am!

606
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,360
I sure am!

607
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,540
Yeah, 59.

608
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:05,920
These are the keys to the puzzles.

609
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,240
Uh, that's, that was it.

610
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,720
For now.

611
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:13,940
Maybe.

612
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,800
And let us observe this.

613
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,100
Oh.

614
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,560
Oh my god.

615
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,820
Wait, hold on.

616
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,060
Okay, there's, there's four books.

617
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:39,680
five wait there's many books wait wait oh my gosh there's
many books okay

618
00:47:47,280 --> 00:48:01,600
oh awesome i have called this age channel oh my god this is
so hard to read i have called this age channel wood and it

619
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:08,520
is a very different world though it is exactly how i
imagined it it is still amazing to see it with my own eyes

620
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:23,540
water covers this age as far as i could see thank you oh one
moment youtube told me i'm in your top 0.2 percent of

621
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:33,400
viewers thank you i can now declare with statistically
proven expertise thanks for all the fun streams is here

622
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,560
thank you Thank you, thank you.

623
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,280
Water covers this age as far as I can see, except for a
small rocky island.

624
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,640
Elsewhere there are only trees which grow directly out of
the water.

625
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,260
A myriad of thin wood passageways are built just above the
water and disappear into the forest.

626
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,300
I assume they were built some time ago for they appear aged.

627
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,820
I am eager to discover more about this land and its people.

628
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:10,820
but i have arrived here late and i must rest i was awakened
this morning by strange noises coming from a pathway

629
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:20,400
adjacent to one of to the one on which i had slept i saw a
group of monkey-like people heading in my direction not the

630
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:30,000
monkeys they had not seen me yet i did not feel threatened
by their presence their response to me was one that i would

631
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,540
have never expected after staring at me for a short time,
they fell to their knees and began to appear with sort of

632
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,120
ceremonial worship.

633
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,260
Minky.

634
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,020
Imagine just a little group of minkies.

635
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,440
I tried to speak to them, but they did not understand my
language.

636
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,800
Instead, they indicated through enthusiastic hand motions
that I was to follow them.

637
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,380
As we walked, I began to notice that the waters below were
changing colors.

638
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,160
Slowly, subtly, they, the world, well, oh, they would change
from deep blue to muddy orange.

639
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,000
orange to beautifully clear.

640
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,900
I was so intrigued by the water, I hardly noticed that we
had arrived at a ladder.

641
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:18,680
Climbing the ladder led to their village, which is about 10
meters above the water and can only be reached by rope

642
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,640
ladders that stretch from the lower paths to the village
level, approximately halfway up the grand trees.

643
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,500
There's a site called Miss Journey that has all the books
transcribed for easier reading.

644
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,080
Oh!

645
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,440
Thank you!

646
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,620
Right now, I'm okay though.

647
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,560
But thank you, thank you.

648
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,060
It is very interesting.

649
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,240
Oh my god, this is putting me to sleep.

650
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,480
It is very interesting watching these people carry out their
daily tasks.

651
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,560
Even after watching them for hours, I did not understand
exactly what they were doing.

652
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:54,980
How much is this?

653
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,020
So much text.

654
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:18,920
texto a lot this is very interesting yawn

655
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:30,780
i'll keep going i'll keep going ah as sunset they motioned
for me to follow them i followed the creatures to the

656
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:37,160
doorway of an enormous hut strangely once inside i found
that the hut appeared even larger than it had from the

657
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:44,260
outside that's the tortoise the walls were garnished with
bright metals and in the center of the hut sat the leader of

658
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:50,860
these people at least he appeared to be their leader for he
sat a meter off the floor in a thick throne guards

659
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:56,540
surrounded the strong creature who was dressed in many
exotic colorful fabrics next to the leader oh my gosh i

660
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:09,900
can't stop yari i can't stop still fighting the jet hag oh
my gosh because my the maid cafe ran until like 2 a.m ish

661
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,780
for me And then I took a shower afterwards.

662
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,440
And then I was still kind of like excited from the events.

663
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,600
I didn't sleep until 5 a.m.

664
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,820
I didn't sleep until 5.

665
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,050
So I didn't get much rest.

666
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,290
Um, next to the leader sat a very old human.

667
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,190
At least to some extent he appears human.

668
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,950
His hair, which was only on his face and head, was
completely gray.

669
00:52:48,970 --> 00:53:00,470
almost white and hung very long around his frail body his
thin thin head what is a what is a thin head hung implied by

670
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:07,910
an almost grotesque neck that could not hold its head up to
look at me but what a surprise this creature could speak my

671
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:14,290
language shortly thereafter i was given a bed with some hand
motions that looked to be telling me to go to sleep i look

672
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:22,630
forward to learning more As I suspected, the ancient
creature is a human, but he is old beyond his own reckoning

673
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,470
and seems almost insane.

674
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,930
However, the tree dwellers almost revere him as a god.

675
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:32,130
They are treating me now in the same fashion, which makes me
feel very uncomfortable.

676
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:37,290
It is almost impossible to understand this old man.

677
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:38,390
So Vicky?

678
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,590
No, Vicky can remove her head.

679
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,590
She doesn't elongate her neck.

680
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:45,390
Different yokai.

681
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:54,370
his voice is feeble but wild he has adopted much of the
language of the tree dwellers he himself told me he had not

682
00:53:54,370 --> 00:54:03,030
spoken our own tongue in ages I wonder do you guys think you
would forget English like

683
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:20,920
so doki yeah doki doki yeah I usually do in what time span I
don't know we don't know how long this guy guy's been here.

684
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:35,720
I wonder if I never spoke English, if I never used it, but
like, I think even if I, you know, if I learned another

685
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:43,720
language, like how he learned the tree dwellers language or
whatever, I still feel like I would think to myself in my

686
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,480
brain in English, you know what I mean.

687
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,940
So even if I didn't speak it, actually I also talked to
myself out loud.

688
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,920
I know some VTubers forgot their native language after
moving to another country.

689
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,920
That's kind of insane, actually.

690
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:03,560
How?

691
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,560
I feel like that's not possible.

692
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,540
VTubers have not been around long enough for that to happen
to someone, no?

693
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,300
I don't think that's true.

694
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,440
I don't know.

695
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:27,260
I think if you learn a second language, obviously it's
easier to forget that.

696
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:35,480
Hmm.

697
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,820
But yeah, I don't think, yeah.

698
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,680
Obviously, you can get rusty.

699
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,280
But completely forgetting?

700
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,540
I don't know about that.

701
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,320
I think it would have to be a really long time.

702
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,720
But yeah.

703
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,900
I don't know how long, though.

704
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,240
I feel like the human brain...

705
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,160
The brain should be able to remember the whole...

706
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,460
Anyway.

707
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,900
Uh, he attempted to explain to me the history of this place.

708
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,860
The following is my best translation of what he has told me.

709
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,160
Many years ago, the humans and tree dwellers lived together
in this place, which was then a vast island.

710
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,740
They interacted very little.

711
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,820
The humans dwelt on the ground, and the tree dwellers lived
high above the humans.

712
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:28,120
Occasionally, the island was disturbed by mysterious
rumblings, which happened randomly, some sort of tectonic or

713
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,240
volcanic action.

714
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:36,820
I suspect be sometimes slight sometimes heavy tremors would
only last a short time then they would stop allowing

715
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:44,580
everything to return to normal one day things changed the
rumblings began and grew quickly to unprecedented levels

716
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:51,100
soon it became apparent that the entire island was sinking
slowly into the ocean around them many of the humans died

717
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:58,240
that day but not before sacrificing themselves in order to
stop the sinking of the island the humans who lived through

718
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,960
this catastrophe moved into the trees where they gradually
died out.

719
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,600
Maybe because they were unequipped for such an environment.

720
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,440
But humans do not belong in the trees.

721
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,260
I am not sure.

722
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,000
This is the story the old man communicated to me.

723
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,380
Although many details are very unclear on my mind.

724
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,220
I am especially confused as to how the humans saved this
island from completely sinking.

725
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,160
Oh my gosh, what if it's all their bodies?

726
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,380
Their bodies are holding it up.

727
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,000
crazy

728
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:51,330
uh oh wait uh in fact i doubt the accuracy of that part of
the story the island must have stopped on its own yet the

729
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:58,450
old man believes in the truth of the story as if he had been
there i mean it sounds like he did no and the tree dwellers

730
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:07,650
worship him and apparently all humans as if he they were
heroes or gods today with an event which I will never

731
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,030
forget.

732
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:13,370
He began gripping my hands tightly, murmuring something
about rest and asleep.

733
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,370
He then said, we had expected you to come sooner.

734
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:16,990
Whoa!

735
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,370
These actions filled me with some sort of immediate dread.

736
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,530
With much effort, he stood to his feet.

737
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:27,590
I tried to help, but he pushed me away with more force than
I imagined his frail body contained.

738
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,670
The tree dwellers quietly surrounded him with very solemn
faces.

739
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,150
Then they kneeled before him.

740
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,710
He walked to each and placed his hand on their heads.

741
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:42,170
all the while he murmured words which i did not understand
finally he turned to me and smiled then he closed his eyes

742
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:51,190
and walked out the door and off of the narrow path high into
the trees wait what you and doki were my top two channels on

743
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:59,070
youtube this year thank you did you see the statue the
dragoons erected in your honor in minecraft is it the one of

744
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,350
me twerking because if so

745
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:15,430
What a monument it is.

746
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,510
What a monument it is.

747
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,010
The tree dwellers were silent.

748
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,950
They began a procession down the nearest rope ladder.

749
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:32,370
As I was descending, I saw several of them pick up the body.

750
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,350
He had fallen onto a lower level of walkway and carried it
away.

751
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,610
He was laying down at the dead end of the short pier-like
structure.

752
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:45,850
With the use of some potion, one of the tree creatures lit
the pier on fire, and I watched as the flames engulfed him.

753
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:51,210
As this strange funeral proceeded, the waters around the
pier changed to dull green.

754
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,750
Oh my gosh, he was green the whole time.

755
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:57,670
Green women.

756
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:58,230
Yeah!

757
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:04,710
This morning I woke, finding it hard to even believe the
previous evening's events.

758
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:13,070
a dull green for as far as i can see now for some reason the
water no longer shifts colors as i wander throughout the

759
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,430
passage of the pathways

760
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:25,350
oh my gosh it's also like the sound of the waves and
everything is put me to sleep the creatures watch me curious

761
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:31,690
to see what i will do next they're constantly offering me
strange objects of affection i even found food outside the

762
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:39,730
doorway to the room in which i had slept I hope to learn
their language soon so that I may learn more from them.

763
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:43,310
Oh, Catherine!

764
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,890
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

765
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,510
This is like, this is the guy.

766
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:51,570
Oh, that, I think, did the message.

767
01:00:54,370 --> 01:01:00,070
I have lived on this world for three months off and on, and
the tree dwellers have shown great hospitality.

768
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,990
I am even beginning to learn bits of their language.

769
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:08,970
I've decided to return home for an extended stay, with my
loving wife and my sons, and hopefully return with them.

770
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,930
However, I am sure Catherine will once again refuse.

771
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:19,690
I think this age would be a wonderful experience for them
all, and I at least look forward to how Sirius and Akanar

772
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,850
will react to its curious inhabitants.

773
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:27,670
Don't say, don't say, don't say, the ink is changing colors.

774
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:28,670
Pay attention to that.

775
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,670
Yeah, I figured it was probably important, right?

776
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,380
Ah!

777
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,760
Catherine is staying behind as expected.

778
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,080
My sons have returned with me and they enjoy this age very
much.

779
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,600
They get along very well with the tree dwellers and are
picking up their language surprisingly fast.

780
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:55,920
I have no doubt that it will not be too long until they can
speak with the tree dwellers much better than myself.

781
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:00,080
I am leaving tomorrow to check on...

782
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:07,400
O... O... Ozomoy... Ozomoyan age.

783
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,040
Sirius has suggested that I allow him and his father to
stay.

784
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,500
His father.

785
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,540
Oh, his brother.

786
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:23,400
My bad.

787
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,720
The script is hard to read.

788
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:36,780
Oh my god.

789
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,800
Wait, how much more?

790
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,820
Okay, just a couple more pages, guys.

791
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,980
I don't think I'll read every single book, but we'll see.

792
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,160
Just four more.

793
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,380
I have another cheesecake question.

794
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,340
Should I make regular Oreo or peanut butter Oreo?

795
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,260
Regular Oreo, regular Oreo, is my opinion.

796
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,360
Though the idea unsettles me, I know the boys are growing up
rapidly.

797
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:09,660
The hospitality of these creatures is such that I could
think of no better place to leave them alone for a short

798
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:09,980
while.

799
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,680
So I will consent to their request.

800
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:18,880
I warn the boys not to take advantage of the respect the
tree dwellers have for their ideas.

801
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,440
They seem to understand my warning, and I have faith they
will follow it.

802
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,040
thriving in ever, ever dunes.

803
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,520
I learned that Pran and her people are continuing to be
menaced by the...

804
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,580
Kuchi.

805
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,780
I still remember playing Miss when I was a kid.

806
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,280
They're cute for the severed cut!

807
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,300
By the what?

808
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,400
What does that say?

809
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,860
It's a real menace.

810
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,820
What does it say?

811
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:01,740
The...

812
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,560
chok-chok-chok-chok-chok-chok-chok.

813
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:12,380
A fear for their survival and plan on returning to her
shortly after checking on Sirus and Akanar here.

814
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,300
See Everdune's Journal for more information.

815
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,020
Uh, oh no.

816
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,780
There's an Everdune's Journal!

817
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:24,240
Okay, after watching Sirus and Akanar, I see they are
handling things very well.

818
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,760
And I think I can put to rest any fears about leaving them
in Channel Wood again.

819
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,900
And for a little longer time.

820
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,160
the tree dweller seems slightly distressed that i am

821
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:49,210
leaving but are happy that sirius and akinar are staying
behind again i have been gone for over three days and i've

822
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:55,810
been to many different places i had to tell sirius and
akinar that pran's oh oh about pran's death today and they

823
01:04:55,810 --> 01:05:01,770
were visibly shaken although they only remembered her from
their childhood katherine has suggested that it would be

824
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:08,850
wise for sirius and akinar to leave a while and i have to
agree they will be returning with me when i leave again

825
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:24,010
giggle bites of welcome to membership thank you this is
serious it's serious oh my gosh i have told my sons that

826
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:30,290
they will be returning with me in in two days they spent the
entire night telling me of an adventure they experienced in

827
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:35,970
my absence and it was rather remarkable it seems they
constructed a boat with the creatures and traveled some ways

828
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:37,830
out into the surrounding waters.

829
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,330
I enjoy hearing them talk excitedly of their adventures.

830
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,850
Is that the boat that's sunk then?

831
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,910
And I'm reminded of my own adventures as a child.

832
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:51,950
I finally understand why the tree dwellers have been giving
me their many inks and insisting I write with them.

833
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:58,290
Looking through some of my past entries I see now that the
inks have changed from the black I thought they were to

834
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,650
various different colors.

835
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:04,530
I have shown some of the creatures my and they laughed and
howled.

836
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,070
I did not know they had such a sense of humor.

837
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:16,230
Even now, as I look back, oh, look through this very
colorful journal, I cannot help but laugh myself.

838
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,230
Yeah, get pranked, Bozo.

839
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,950
We will be returning tomorrow, so my sons are with the
creatures for the last night here.

840
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:31,710
They have told me that they would like to come to
Channelwood again and also asked if they can visit some

841
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:32,610
other ages alone.

842
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:36,430
Though I will have to think over their request.

843
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:43,310
I believe they have proven to me that I'm like using every
single brain cell to read these, you guys.

844
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,350
That they are trustworthy and responsible.

845
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:51,130
Catherine will also have to help me decide whether they are
ready for travel alone.

846
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:56,870
For now, I must give my farewells to the creatures for I do
not know how long it will be until I visit this age again.

847
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:57,610
Oh!

848
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,010
Holy cow!

849
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:10,190
Osmoian, ages of reference joke about Cyan's earlier games,
Cosmic Osmo.

850
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:11,190
Oh, neat.

851
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:15,170
Holy.

852
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:18,670
That was this one, right?

853
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:19,350
Yeah.

854
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,360
I should call her.

855
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,040
I'm thinking the same thing.

856
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:48,840
Back in the day, you had to read entire in-game novels for
the possibility of a hint about what to do next.

857
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,980
I know!

858
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,790
Wait a second!

859
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:02,030
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

860
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,540
These are important.

861
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,000
Who let the author cook?

862
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,210
I'm playing piano!

863
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:25,870
Oh my gosh.

864
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:26,810
I doubt.

865
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:29,150
Okay.

866
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,280
They're so burnt.

867
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,660
Look at all of them.

868
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,260
It kind of looks like...

869
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,520
No, no, Graham.

870
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,040
No, no, Graham.

871
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,660
What is this?

872
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Why are there so many?

873
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,260
Wait, why are there...

874
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,640
Okay.

875
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,320
Only 300 codes that we have to...

876
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,900
Which one was that?

877
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:23,320
This one?

878
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,460
Okay, it's this one on the floor, right?

879
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:37,630
Okay, this one's not so long.

880
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:39,230
Yes, it is, but...

881
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:44,560
God!

882
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,760
Just making sure I got all of them.

883
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,320
I think it's like all the thicker books.

884
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,300
What's this one supposed to be?

885
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:55,640
Oh, wait.

886
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,620
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

887
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:14,040
guy okay this book needs an audio version this is the
perfect time you know how in metal gear solid v how you can

888
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:20,160
listen to the audio you can listen to the tapes while you
walk around usually i don't want to do that but this would

889
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:29,600
be the perfect time to to do have that feature how

890
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,540
much of this do you

891
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:49,380
I mean probably an algorithm to those 300 codes that will
let you create them all The game is old They don't have the

892
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,420
technology They do They have literal spaceships What are you
talking about

893
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:01,680
Minstogenshi self It would be Much bigger

894
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,900
It would be Much bigger.

895
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:13,640
Okay, I'm going to take a break from reading because I will
go bonkers.

896
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,440
I need to see the sunlight.

897
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,420
And we're going to go to the dentist.

898
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,160
And we are going to try.

899
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:29,270
Uh...

900
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,730
Wait, I'm already on October.

901
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:31,630
I'm a genius.

902
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,730
October 11th.

903
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:38,710
Oh.

904
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,030
1984.

905
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:53,460
Okay.

906
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,300
I don't know why it stops the audio.

907
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,800
I love these games.

908
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,660
Like these in school.

909
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,140
Yeah!

910
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,940
And then 10.04 a.m.

911
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,020
Okay.

912
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,060
This was the sunken ship.

913
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,620
Let's see what we got.

914
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,380
Wait, why is it like...

915
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,620
Oh, the light is still on.

916
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,100
That's why.

917
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:21,920
I'm stupid.

918
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:23,540
Okay.

919
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,770
I guess I can't shut the door.

920
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:30,690
Alright!

921
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:33,430
I'm gonna take a picture of this with my phone.

922
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,940
Oh, why do I have flash on?

923
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,020
Turn off?

924
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,700
Turn off flash?

925
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,720
Off flash.

926
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:51,040
Okay.

927
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,760
Okie dokie!

928
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,180
Let's do January...

929
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,500
17th?

930
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,520
12.07.

931
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,390
Oh, whoops.

932
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:23,430
07 at 5.46 a.m.

933
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:33,030
I take a picture.

934
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,820
Alright, and let's do November 23rd.

935
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,500
9,791.

936
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,830
1,791 at 6...

937
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:06,170
Oh, no, no, I had it.

938
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,320
Okay, at 6, 57 p.m.

939
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,000
Okay, what do we got?

940
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,480
Whoa, that one's kind of freaky looking.

941
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,420
It looks like a deer or something.

942
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,160
All right.

943
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,560
Very good.

944
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,320
Yeah, not a minute, Before or later, we are extremely
punctual.

945
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,180
Alright, I think that's all we can do here for now.

946
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,560
And I did want to...

947
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,180
Not you.

948
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,660
Go here.

949
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,860
Oh, I think I wasn't.

950
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:08,240
There we go.

951
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:08,540
Okay.

952
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,080
There were the vaults, you know.

953
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,800
Let's see.

954
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,200
She has not managed to find a world book yet.

955
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:23,660
No.

956
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,560
I just started the game!

957
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,660
Am I supposed to find it immediately?

958
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,560
59 volts.

959
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,900
I imagine that's the power to this.

960
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,140
Maybe it's just the power.

961
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,700
Oh no, to the spaceship, right?

962
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:46,110
Hmm.

963
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,900
I went over.

964
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,720
We were so close.

965
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,680
We were so close.

966
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,940
We were so close to greatness.

967
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,440
Why is it only going to one side, though?

968
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:25,570
Wait a second.

969
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,340
Never anticipated players would be able to take
high-resolution pictures.

970
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,100
Yeah.

971
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:38,300
I blew the breaker.

972
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,220
Wait, how do I re- Wait, do you think I have to...

973
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,760
Oh my gosh, that's annoying.

974
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:49,600
Wait, do I have to go, like, flip the switch again here?

975
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,340
Like that?

976
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,500
Can I even get in here?

977
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,480
Okay, not yet.

978
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:03,310
Oops.

979
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:19,320
No!

980
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:24,470
Okay, hold on.

981
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:30,690
Let's, uh, before we do that, though, I'm going to number
each and every one of these so that we don't just trial and

982
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:31,050
error.

983
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:38,390
So, we have 10, 7, 8,

984
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,620
16, Five.

985
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,260
That's the ones on the left.

986
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:51,580
All right.

987
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,520
Then we have one.

988
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,820
Two.

989
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,300
Twenty-two.

990
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:12,060
Nineteen.

991
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:18,940
And nine.

992
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,620
Okay, awesome.

993
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,360
Okay, okay, okay.

994
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,790
Okay, okay, okay.

995
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:32,290
Uh, wrong way?

996
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:32,970
There we go.

997
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:39,910
Where is the... Oh, wait, I wonder if it's that bad boy
right there.

998
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,120
Maybe.

999
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:53,180
I don't know what this means, but it's my brain blast.

1000
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,740
It's when I'm super smart.

1001
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:01,300
Okay.

1002
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:02,400
Okay.

1003
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,200
Okay, dokey.

1004
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,020
What equals 59?

1005
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,620
Time for a calculator.

1006
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,160
Calculator.

1007
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,860
I'm going to, okay, I'm going to brute force this.

1008
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:27,220
I'm going to start with 22, 19.

1009
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:30,940
Oops, oops, oops, oops.

1010
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:32,140
What?

1011
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,500
Uh, 9?

1012
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,060
Oh, okay, 22, 19, 9, and 1.

1013
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,440
Okay, okay, I got this.

1014
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,240
22, 19.

1015
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,140
Wait!

1016
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,100
Why?

1017
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,570
Hmm.

1018
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:19,870
Is there another breaker?

1019
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:34,780
There's two breakers, I think.

1020
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,420
Me think.

1021
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,500
That's stupid.

1022
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,320
Whoops, wrong way.

1023
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:46,520
Trying to see what like the...

1024
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,460
It goes to here.

1025
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:51,100
It doesn't go anywhere else.

1026
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,520
The wire.

1027
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,320
Follow the lines.

1028
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,400
It's right here.

1029
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:06,280
Oh!

1030
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,380
No!

1031
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,560
Oh, asshole!

1032
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,160
How am I supposed to get over there?

1033
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:19,320
Uh...

1034
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,240
Dang it.

1035
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:21,840
It's bitter.

1036
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:30,000
Oh my gosh, I could have solved it if I was just smart!

1037
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:36,860
How do...

1038
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,180
How do...

1039
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,860
How do...

1040
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,740
This is one of the advantages of the 3D version.

1041
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,280
You can actually walk up to it.

1042
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,160
Right!

1043
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,020
Does anyone know you can spoil this?

1044
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,700
We're only trying to get to a place, so I don't mind.

1045
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,220
Is it something that I can reach at the moment, or do I have
to wait?

1046
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:11,930
Click next to the door.

1047
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:13,430
Whoa!

1048
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:14,890
Whoa.

1049
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,190
Okay.

1050
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:42,650
I did see this building.

1051
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:45,670
I did not see how we would be able to get to it.

1052
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,050
So I just accidentally got to it.

1053
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,930
I'm still not sure how.

1054
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,970
Okay, like that, I suppose.

1055
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:58,910
Yeah, I just click towards it.

1056
01:22:59,230 --> 01:22:59,950
Okay, so here?

1057
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:01,870
Aha!

1058
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:03,770
Thank you!

1059
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:08,290
All right.

1060
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:10,970
Thank you very much, team.

1061
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,310
This is why we're a team.

1062
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,490
This is why we're a team, everybody.

1063
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,410
Okay, what was it?

1064
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:25,210
22, 19, 9.

1065
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:29,250
Oh, it's 59 volts!

1066
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,070
I thought it was 51.

1067
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,000
Wait, I can do this, I can do this.

1068
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,460
8, 9.

1069
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:44,340
Okay.

1070
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,120
I almost...

1071
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:04,000
I almost, I almost, I almost really...

01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:12,380

1076
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,660
Really good.

1077
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,500
I

1078
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:53,830
have vivid core memory of my parents drawing directly on the
computer monitor screens for one of these puzzles!

1079
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,150
No way!

1080
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,710
Well, I have to.

1081
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:59,910
What is this here now?

1082
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:13,700
Okay.

1083
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,860
Tip for the wonderful piano concert.

1084
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1085
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,280
Oh.

1086
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,680
You can slide those.

1087
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:26,120
Oh, I can.

1088
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:34,710
Reboot!

1089
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:40,060
Oh.

1090
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,160
I do remember the piano book.

1091
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:56,960
Yes, indeed.

1092
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:57,680
I do.

1093
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,620
I don't remember which one it was.

1094
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,280
Might have been this one.

1095
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,900
There's so much text.

1096
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:08,420
Oh.

1097
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:15,190
I take a photo?

1098
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,870
I take a photo?

1099
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:22,670
Alright, let's go back.

1100
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,380
I love modern technology!

1101
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:30,980
Oops.

1102
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,260
I did flip the other switch for that cabin, right?

1103
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,320
All right, one.

1104
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:40,900
Four.

1105
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,880
Oh, sorry, that's not how you count.

1106
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,560
I didn't, okay, I'll go back, one.

1107
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:16,750
Maybe I have to do it on the other, on here.

1108
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:18,370
Well, how would I?

1109
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:27,110
Wait, but, but.

1110
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,510
What was it?

1111
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,860
Pitch perfect!

1112
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:51,150
Ah!

1113
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,000
What was it?

1114
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,740
Wait, oh.

1115
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:01,840
Oh.

1116
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:12,870
Nothing happened.

1117
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:17,810
That was definitely it though, no?

1118
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,080
Oh, what?

1119
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,260
Oh, what?

1120
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,040
Oh!

1121
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,540
I got the wrong thing!

1122
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:28,960
Baa!

1123
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:30,340
Oh!

1124
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:34,180
There we go.

1125
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:42,480
Whoa!

1126
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,140
Watch out, buddy!

1127
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,260
Oh my gosh!

1128
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,700
Whoa.

1129
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,400
Is this what it used to look like?

1130
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,040
Who's driving this thing?

1131
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,720
The trees.

1132
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,000
Ooh, my eyes.

1133
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:06,740
A bit right.

1134
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,460
McDonald's Wi-Fi.

1135
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,080
How

1136
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,500
do I go home?

1137
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:50,610
Oh, shoot.

1138
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:52,930
Ugh.

1139
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:02,930
It's in my eardrums.

1140
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:04,550
What does that do?

1141
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,250
There was so much I...

1142
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,690
I didn't...

1143
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:07,970
Whoa!

1144
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:09,850
Whoa.

1145
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:12,950
There was so much I haven't done yet.

1146
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:14,890
So much to live for.

1147
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:22,130
Can I move this?

1148
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:24,870
I guess that's light.

1149
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:29,150
I think maybe these are similar to the things over in the
other world.

1150
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:31,130
So let's press all of these.

1151
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:34,890
You know, kind of like the switches that I needed to pull
down.

1152
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:37,630
Maybe it's similar.

1153
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,630
puzzles.

1154
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:50,430
Oh.

1155
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,600
Well, this is where I was.

1156
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:06,500
Wind.

1157
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,940
I'm trying to, like, look through this, but I guess not.

1158
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:14,500
Oh!

1159
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:14,840
Oh!

1160
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:19,900
Uh.

1161
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:20,400
Oh!

1162
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:26,130
Guys, I'm scared.

1163
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:30,050
Where am I?

1164
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,170
That's a microphone.

1165
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:36,710
Wait.

1166
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:39,430
Please.

1167
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:40,770
Okay, never mind.

1168
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:42,070
I thought I could click these.

1169
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:51,650
Oh.

1170
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:56,920
What a terrible sound.

1171
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:13,770
Hold on.

1172
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:18,670
Outer Wilds?

1173
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:20,730
We're getting a sound?

1174
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:22,550
Maybe?

1175
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:27,830
Uh-huh.

1176
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:42,680
I can't tell if it's just looping or not, you know?

1177
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,100
Hmm.

1178
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,180
So far, I have no clue.

1179
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,460
So far, um, no idea.

1180
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:16,370
Hmm.

1181
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:19,450
Hmm.

1182
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:25,190
Where haven't I been?

1183
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,650
This area is so confusing.

1184
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:31,510
I fear I will be...

1185
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:35,330
Um, really lost.

1186
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:36,230
Oh, wait, there's a note here.

1187
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:38,610
Oh, I got a red page!

1188
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:40,110
Wait, where do I...

1189
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:41,270
How do I...

1190
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:44,130
How do I bring it to my red page?

1191
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,190
Wait, I got a red page.

1192
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,950
Can't remember if you have to manually save.

1193
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:51,350
I think you do.

1194
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:53,310
You should save, huh?

1195
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:54,750
Oh, it does have an auto-save.

1196
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:56,030
But I'll save too.

1197
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:01,570
Sounds...

1198
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,290
Okay, resume.

1199
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:06,790
Just hold on to it for now!

1200
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:07,390
Okay.

1201
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:10,890
What if I need to grab something else?

1202
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:16,900
Sounds...

1203
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,740
I don't know where to go.

1204
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,140
How long until I can go home?

1205
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,720
Kuchida no, no, no, no.

1206
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:40,980
I'm stuck.

1207
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:42,940
I'm stuck.

1208
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:43,940
Okay.

1209
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,040
Oh my gosh, I keep going to the same place.

1210
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:47,540
Sorry.

1211
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:56,010
Can I go home?

1212
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:00,650
I don't know what's going on here yet.

1213
01:36:01,410 --> 01:36:03,110
Oh, there's also a...

1214
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:04,650
There was a mic here too though.

1215
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:05,790
Oh.

1216
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:28,340
do you speak whale do you speak whale oh the trees water oh
wait what about my red page it's a purple page currently

1217
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:45,140
it's gone it went back to the other spot I see why do we
have microphones by the onsen

1218
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:50,760
This is so mysterious.

1219
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,740
Who built all this?

1220
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,060
I guess we'll just have to remember...

1221
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,520
Oh, whoops, wrong way.

1222
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,260
Remember where the other one was.

1223
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,060
Okay, okay, okay.

1224
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:20,460
I think I understand.

1225
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:23,820
Okay.

1226
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:37,740
that order before maybe we have to put the sounds oh my gosh
okay I think

1227
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:54,840
it might have been the order we learned over here so clock
equals

1228
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:03,480
Clock sounds And like, yeah

1229
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:10,320
How do you describe this?

1230
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:19,960
The book in the library talks more about the ages Mateus
spent quite a bit of time Building each of them Usually

1231
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:31,820
several months or more for each one With help typically Oh
The clocky Clocky with occasional

1232
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:38,110
rings.

1233
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:38,990
You hear that?

1234
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:39,250
Blah?

1235
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:40,350
Okay.

1236
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,810
What else?

1237
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,710
The colorful rot?

1238
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:46,230
Wait, what does this one look like, though?

1239
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:48,530
Okay.

1240
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:50,710
Oh, gosh.

1241
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:51,670
What is this thing called?

1242
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:54,250
I literally had to save...

1243
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:56,210
Oh my gosh.

1244
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,290
What is this thing called again?

1245
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:03,170
I literally said it because... Oh, the Yes, the obelisk,
thank you.

1246
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:07,130
Obelisk equals flute.

1247
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:09,270
Oh, good.

1248
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:11,930
Okay, it did go back to your life.

1249
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:18,890
When Nimmy and Phoebe and I all did the escape room
together,

1250
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:32,140
they were like, do you know what this shape is?

1251
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:33,020
And it was an obelisk.

1252
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,460
It's an obelisk!

1253
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:36,420
And they were like, how do you know that?

1254
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,480
And I was like, didn't every kid have like a...

1255
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,780
Like a...

1256
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:43,140
An Egypt phase?

1257
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,300
Okay, wind.

1258
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:46,600
Okay, these are...

1259
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,760
Okay, wind equals wind.

1260
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,700
Easy peasy.

1261
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,560
No.

1262
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,880
We need to go this way.

1263
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:00,640
No.

1264
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,220
Oh my gosh.

1265
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,960
It's so hard to click!

1266
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:19,000
please let me go this way is it this way is it this way no
this goes back to the fluids there was like an underground

1267
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:30,520
passage this is the clocks this is the fire but what's the
symbol okay it's the crack in the ground the lightning crack

1268
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,280
equals fire sounds.

1269
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,260
I think it can use keyboard to walk?

1270
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,400
Why should I?

1271
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,960
No, it doesn't seem like it.

1272
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,200
Point only.

1273
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:53,400
And then there was this one over here.

1274
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:54,440
This is probably water.

1275
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:57,460
Yep.

1276
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,340
I guess I really don't need to write these down.

1277
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:03,340
But that's fine.

1278
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,140
That's fine.

1279
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:05,340
Water.

1280
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,940
equals water sounds.

1281
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,660
Still have the book of my dead for my childhood Egypt phase.

1282
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,460
I think every kid went through an Egypt phase.

1283
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,940
Especially if you were like a millennial kid.

1284
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:21,260
Because you watched, I know you watched the mummy and you
were like, I'm gonna become an archaeologist now.

1285
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,720
It's literally just what happens.

1286
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:24,740
Is it this way?

1287
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:30,630
Oh, I can just go in here.

1288
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:33,030
I'm silly.

1289
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:33,590
I forgot.

1290
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,780
Guilty as charged.

1291
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,860
I know, I know.

1292
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,700
You are not alone.

1293
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,040
Okay, here we go.

1294
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,120
I feel like we'll have to come back here, though, for...

1295
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:57,120
Am I supposed to look at it?

1296
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:57,720
Let's see.

1297
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:04,050
Or is this the view from it?

1298
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:07,270
I think this is the view from it.

1299
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:08,530
Alright.

1300
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:10,010
It's water.

1301
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:13,290
Crack.

1302
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:16,490
Clock.

1303
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:18,490
Obelisk.

1304
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:20,450
Wind.

1305
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:20,990
Okay.

1306
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:23,390
Get me out of here.

1307
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:24,190
Get me out of here.

1308
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:27,250
We're braining.

1309
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:28,290
We're braining right now.

1310
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:29,550
We're braining.

1311
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:30,070
We're braining.

1312
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:35,430
Do you guys think I'm right?

1313
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,550
Do you guys think I'm right?

1314
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:40,190
I don't know.

1315
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,140
It seems like you're cooking.

1316
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:53,980
Yeah, yeah.

1317
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:54,900
Okay, so water.

1318
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:55,720
sound.

1319
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:00,420
Train sound.

1320
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:04,510
Oh, water!

1321
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:05,310
Wait.

1322
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:07,010
Water sound.

1323
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:15,650
Maybe that.

1324
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:17,390
I just have to be on it.

1325
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,210
Okay, it's the very last one.

1326
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:23,950
Okay, crack is a fire sound.

1327
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:24,730
Okay.

1328
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:27,410
This one.

1329
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:27,930
Okay.

1330
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:30,250
Clock is clocky sound.

1331
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:42,370
This one.

1332
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:45,650
Obelisk is flutey sound.

1333
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:49,670
Wind is...

1334
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:50,330
Windy sound.

1335
01:43:58,050 --> 01:43:58,820
This one?

1336
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,860
Every kid has an ancient Egypt phase, but nobody leaves
their ancient Rome phase!

1337
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,020
Ha ha ha!

1338
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,790
Did I do it wrong?

1339
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:26,230
If

1340
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,420
something happens, you've missed something.

1341
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,260
That was the order on that thing.

1342
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,860
Maybe I guess that's not the order.

1343
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:56,790
18 months!

1344
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:57,790
Thank you, Deacross!

1345
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:58,750
Thank you!

1346
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,730
I missed something.

1347
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:06,890
Long hair Minto is my Roman Empire.

1348
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:09,290
Is it now?

1349
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:18,730
Something with the cameras, I'm guessing.

1350
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:19,390
Maybe.

1351
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:34,740
I don't know.

1352
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:37,320
Hint!

1353
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,240
Hint!

1354
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:39,160
Hint!

1355
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:40,760
Gentler with the camera.

1356
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:41,700
Okay.

1357
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,080
We'll go back to the camera.

1358
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:45,880
I can't remember how to get there.

1359
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:48,860
I guess we just go to the wind and we go into the passage.

1360
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:51,620
I remember how to get there.

1361
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:52,720
I was such a liar.

1362
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,000
Why did I say that?

1363
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:16,060
I'm seeing if there's anything that I should be aiming at.

1364
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,120
Okay.

1365
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,860
The bottom button will light up, will it?

1366
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,820
Oh, thank you for that hint.

1367
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:35,420
Okay, that makes things so much easier.

1368
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,520
Brain cell boosting glasses are a good move.

1369
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:49,850
I want to see if it, like, flashes really quick.

1370
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:52,050
It does not.

1371
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:13,870
Just...

1372
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:14,410
Ugh.

1373
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:17,290
I want to aim it at the right sound.

1374
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:20,070
Yeah, but it all sounds the same.

1375
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,840
Like, I feel like it's on a loop.

1376
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,700
Like, I feel like...

1377
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:39,970
Let's hold on.

1378
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,170
Be.

1379
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:47,500
Look for satellite dishes.

1380
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:48,440
Is that what it is?

1381
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,320
Because I did see one in here.

1382
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:50,640
here.

1383
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:54,180
This guy.

1384
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:08,390
Maybe that?

1385
01:48:12,970 --> 01:48:15,130
Yeah, I did press the buttons off the side.

1386
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:16,250
I did press those.

1387
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:17,630
Try the clock first.

1388
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:19,010
Is that one easier?

1389
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:21,390
Oh!

1390
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:25,610
Maybe I didn't press the water one.

1391
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:30,750
Okay, okay, okay.

1392
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,830
I don't think I pressed the water one.

1393
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:36,290
Awesome.

1394
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:40,550
Because I was like, it really doesn't change at all, you
guys.

1395
01:48:42,370 --> 01:48:42,730
Okay.

1396
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,330
Back to the water, all the way to the front.

1397
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:48,750
Wrong.

1398
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:52,350
This way.

1399
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:56,710
Wait, I did, though.

1400
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,020
It didn't show up at all, though.

1401
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:14,840
The clock one showed up, like, immediately.

1402
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:16,120
Okay.

1403
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:20,800
Whoops.

1404
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,070
Water is hard to find.

1405
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:28,460
We'll try the other ones first then.

1406
01:49:30,870 --> 01:49:31,410
Okay.

1407
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,000
This is like...

1408
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,660
Perfect quality.

1409
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:37,460
This is it.

1410
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:38,840
55.6, baby.

1411
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:39,120
Okay.

1412
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,220
This is the...

1413
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:53,030
Uh...

1414
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:54,930
This one makes the fire sounds.

1415
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:57,770
Is that it right there?

1416
01:49:58,050 --> 01:49:58,350
No.

1417
01:49:59,330 --> 01:49:59,870
No.

1418
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:01,090
No.

1419
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:04,230
Does the E light up when perfect?

1420
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:05,290
I don't think so.

1421
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:07,630
I feel like this has to be perfect though though.

1422
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:09,910
Oh, that's the clock again.

1423
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:12,670
Then it would be over here.

1424
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:15,490
There we go.

1425
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:17,350
I know my

1426
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:26,330
direction.

1427
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:27,930
Extreme precision.

1428
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:39,740
I can't tell.

1429
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,560
I can't tell!

1430
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:52,680
I feel like I'm always hearing static.

1431
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:57,580
Blink equals close, stop blink equals perfect.

1432
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:07,860
Like this blink right here.

1433
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:10,300
This is so nostalgic!

1434
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,180
Hopefully you'll beat it because I never could as a kid.

1435
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:14,880
Yeah, me too.

1436
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,360
I'll do my best.

1437
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:21,860
We got it.

1438
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:23,280
Awesome.

1439
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,460
Oh my gosh, that is so useful.

1440
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:27,120
Thank you.

1441
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:35,760
so then okay that one's not blinking this one is the flute
noise it should be extremely easy to hear

1442
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:42,740
this should be in here

1443
01:51:55,540 --> 01:52:00,460
this is like a nice little visual clue if you know what it
means

1444
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:18,760
okay okay the wind which one oh the wind was the tunnel
So...

1445
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,660
Wind tunnel!

1446
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:22,700
Ah, okay.

1447
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:29,330
Nice!

1448
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:30,310
Okay.

1449
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:34,170
Water.

1450
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:39,430
Water.

1451
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:42,390
Would be...

1452
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:43,370
Where's the fire?

1453
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:43,970
There.

1454
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:45,230
So it would be this way.

1455
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:48,930
Right?

1456
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,640
Unless it's over more?

1457
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:01,700
Ah!

1458
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:06,440
Oh my gosh, I finally found it.

1459
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,380
Hi!

1460
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:16,020
Is that it?

1461
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:24,450
Oh, it's telling me the order!

1462
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:25,430
Wait, hold on.

1463
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:26,310
Oh, shoot.

1464
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,670
Wait.

1465
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:27,690
Oh, wait.

1466
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:28,910
One more time.

1467
01:53:30,430 --> 01:53:31,130
One more time.

1468
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:32,150
Flute.

1469
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:33,270
Oblisk.

1470
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:33,790
Water.

1471
01:53:34,330 --> 01:53:34,630
Wind.

1472
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:35,450
Fire.

1473
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:39,590
Uh, uh, obelisk.

1474
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:41,530
One more time.

1475
01:53:43,530 --> 01:53:43,850
Water.

1476
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:46,250
Fire.

1477
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:47,310
Clock.

1478
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:48,470
Okay, we got it.

1479
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:50,290
Do you think I need to remember these numbers?

1480
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:52,590
Probably not, right?

1481
01:53:56,770 --> 01:53:57,890
Probably not, right?

1482
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:01,550
Mayhaps.

1483
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:03,710
I hope not.

1484
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:06,450
I don't think they would be that.

1485
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:07,330
That's...

1486
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:09,270
It's just for that puzzle, right?

1487
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:11,230
It's not for...

1488
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:11,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1489
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:13,770
It's not for any other puzzle, right?

1490
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:14,870
Okay, here we go.

1491
01:54:15,310 --> 01:54:16,690
All right, first is flute.

1492
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:18,710
Okay, water.

1493
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:31,960
Oh, here we go.

1494
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,240
Fire.

1495
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:35,220
Clock.

1496
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,940
I mean, don't play an avatar over here.

1497
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,960
I know, I feel like...

1498
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,620
Oh my god, I did

1499
01:54:57,710 --> 01:54:57,870
it.

1500
01:54:58,510 --> 01:54:59,410
A submarine?

1501
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,000
Here comes the fun part, lie.

1502
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:11,880
Alright, don't lie.

1503
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:12,420
No.

1504
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:15,440
Wait, no way there's a water level in this game.

1505
01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:26,670
What am I doing in here?

1506
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:29,870
Is Iron Lung real?

1507
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:32,550
Is the Iron Lung movie out yet?

1508
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:56,340
This part is all audio key.

1509
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:06,050
What the hell does that mean?

1510
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:12,430
What the hell does that

1511
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:26,820
mean?

1512
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:38,280
Welcome to Rapture.

1513
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:46,720
I'm guessing all of these...

1514
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:50,120
I'm guessing the pink is like the correct sound.

1515
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,320
Right.

1516
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:54,940
Okay.

1517
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,560
Each sound has a specific meaning.

1518
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:26,000
There are four possible sounds after every stop.

1519
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:28,860
You came from the south heading north.

1520
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:32,120
Yeah, I do remember that.

1521
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:44,620
Wait,

1522
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,540
we haven't even gone back to North, have we?

1523
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,960
I was trying to find North again.

1524
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,700
I hope you took notes from earlier in the game.

1525
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,620
I have notes?

1526
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:26,230
um everything was the same sound literally every single one

1527
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:32,450
just kidding

1528
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:43,750
so if i go back i guess at home

1529
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:58,260
i was responding to a text from someone Almost put a green
heart at the end.

1530
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:00,400
Would have been very confusing in that combo.

1531
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,160
That's funny.

1532
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:05,020
Thank you, Darko!

1533
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:06,500
Okay.

1534
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,440
Can I get out of here?

1535
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:16,900
I didn't read about this world.

1536
01:59:27,090 --> 01:59:28,210
This is my home now.

1537
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:28,570
Okay.

1538
01:59:28,810 --> 01:59:29,730
We're going back.

1539
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:30,690
We're going back.

1540
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:37,780
Um...

1541
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:38,960
Um...

1542
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:56,010
Sweet land, sweet land.

1543
01:59:57,110 --> 01:59:57,790
Okay, hold on.

1544
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:02,910
I still haven't even tried to see if I can go home or not.

1545
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:05,650
Oh.

1546
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:08,090
Definitely not.

1547
02:00:08,610 --> 02:00:08,750
Wait.

1548
02:00:10,590 --> 02:00:10,970
Wait.

1549
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:14,010
The door doesn't even open up anymore.

1550
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:14,990
I have a pain.

1551
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:19,670
Um...

1552
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:21,170
Oh my god, sad chaps!

1553
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:22,950
Thank you so much for the Hakasupa!

1554
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:25,490
Merry Crembus, boss!

1555
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:26,250
Thank you!

1556
02:00:26,450 --> 02:00:27,030
Merry Crembus!

1557
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:30,550
Oh...

1558
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:32,330
Oh...

1559
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:34,150
Do I have to do this?

1560
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:35,990
Oh, I have to do the puzzle again, too.

1561
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,460
You're stuck here until you solve the maze runner.

1562
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:43,440
Alright.

1563
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:45,560
Will you guys assist me?

1564
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,480
Will you guys help me out since...

1565
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,320
I'm okay with backseating here.

1566
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:55,880
We got you?

1567
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:57,060
Okay, give me one second.

1568
02:00:57,340 --> 02:01:00,000
I'm gonna go grab some water.

1569
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,720
While this does its thing, I'll be right back.

1570
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:53,200
Alright, I grabbed some water and two slice of pizza
because...

1571
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:55,000
I didn't have time to eat dinner.

1572
02:02:57,580 --> 02:02:58,460
So I apologize.

1573
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:01,640
All right, guys, let's lock in.

1574
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:03,340
Let's lock in.

1575
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:08,460
I'm hoping that eating will wake me up, too, because I've
been falling asleep.

1576
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:12,580
What you got on your pizza?

1577
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:18,600
I've got tomato, spinach, green pepper.

1578
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,220
Sorry, you can hear how hard it is.

1579
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:20,860
It's leftovers.

1580
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:26,380
Uh, yeah.

1581
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:28,440
Okay.

1582
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:32,570
Veggie pizza.

1583
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:34,130
Okay, forward.

1584
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:45,290
Love me some spinch.

1585
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:46,010
Me too.

1586
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:49,650
Okay.

1587
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:53,130
We are from south headed north.

1588
02:03:53,710 --> 02:03:55,350
I'm going to write that down because I will forget.

1589
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:57,490
From south.

1590
02:03:57,590 --> 02:03:59,030
headed north.

1591
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:04,990
rotate west?

1592
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:11,830
I was gonna ask, is there like a certain sound I should be
looking out for?

1593
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:15,110
Can you imagine being the person who actually lived on this
island?

1594
02:04:15,230 --> 02:04:17,370
Can you imagine how annoying locking up for the night?

1595
02:04:17,710 --> 02:04:18,190
Right!

1596
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:20,390
Only way out is through!

1597
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:21,210
Let's go!

1598
02:04:21,990 --> 02:04:23,270
There are four possible noises.

1599
02:04:23,770 --> 02:04:24,570
What else are the four?

1600
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:30,210
So you guys are saying, okay, Dink sound equals north.

1601
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:31,750
Brrr sound is west.

1602
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:34,550
So we're going west.

1603
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:43,430
Brrr is west.

1604
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:43,950
Brrr.

1605
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:44,990
Brrr.

1606
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:45,810
Brrr is west.

1607
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:54,580
Whoa.

1608
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,420
Now.

1609
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:57,760
Oh, north.

1610
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:16,680
Now what have I need to go northwest will it be like pink

Okay, thank you guys.

1615
02:05:42,510 --> 02:05:44,250
How the hell are you supposed to annoy the police?

1616
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:45,690
Don't.

1617
02:06:01,570 --> 02:06:02,750
Weeks of fun!

1618
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:03,770
Weeks of fun!

1619
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:07,910
Okay, east?

1620
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:22,260
South!

1621
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:29,700
Wait, eat pizza.

1622
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:34,180
Let's go!

1623
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:35,260
Okay, okay.

1624
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,540
This isn't so bad.

1625
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,400
Thank you, everybody.

1626
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:38,480
Thank you so much.

1627
02:06:42,110 --> 02:06:44,330
I don't tell you which direction you need to go in the first
two nodes.

1628
02:06:44,790 --> 02:06:46,690
I have only one way forward, so they...

1629
02:06:47,330 --> 02:06:47,730
So...

1630
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:48,850
So...

1631
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:52,250
They teach you north and west, and then the rest is logic.

1632
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:53,030
This is... Okay.

1633
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:54,390
That was south, right?

1634
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:03,980
Whoa!

1635
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:06,340
Wee!

1636
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:07,100
Wee!

1637
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:07,320
Wee!

1638
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:08,200
That

1639
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:16,980
was West.

1640
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:18,060
Right?

1641
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:20,960
Right.

1642
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:32,960
I wonder where we're going.

1643
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:34,780
How do we do it?

1644
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:41,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1645
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:44,080
Hands up!

1646
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:46,340
Put your hands in the air!

1647
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,000
They're off the lap bar!

1648
02:07:57,740 --> 02:07:58,420
Uh.

1649
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:00,460
Was that south?

1650
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:01,740
Or not south.

1651
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:03,160
Wait.

1652
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:05,500
Where are we facing south?

1653
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:08,460
Oh.

1654
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:09,680
It's too south.

1655
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:13,540
Oh my god.

1656
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:13,720
Wait.

1657
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,160
I need to write these down.

1658
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:18,760
Southwest.

1659
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:20,260
Southwest.

1660
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:22,340
Yeah.

1661
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,180
Oh.

1662
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:24,200
Oops, wrong way.

1663
02:08:28,940 --> 02:08:30,100
I'm gonna listen again.

1664
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,740
Oh, okay, I see it.

1665
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:32,260
I hear it.

1666
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:40,320
Alright, alright, alright.

1667
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:48,930
Why do you build it like this, though?

1668
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:55,250
West.

1669
02:09:01,590 --> 02:09:02,370
West.

1670
02:09:03,690 --> 02:09:04,110
Yes.

1671
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:08,010
Let's go.

1672
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:16,710
As a joke.

1673
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:23,130
Is that Northwest?

1674
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:32,850
I think so.

1675
02:09:36,830 --> 02:09:39,490
I don't remember what North sounds like anymore.

1676
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:40,510
I don't remember what North sounds like anymore.

1677
02:09:45,950 --> 02:09:48,010
My man went crazy with it.

1678
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:57,390
Northeast?

1679
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:04,670
I went the wrong way.

1680
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:12,770
I went the wrong way.

1681
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:14,770
But I'm committed.

1682
02:10:15,570 --> 02:10:17,010
I went the wrong way, but I'm committed.

1683
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:18,370
There we go.

1684
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:28,150
Wins the drop!

1685
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:29,250
Wins the drop!

1686
02:10:31,310 --> 02:10:32,790
Just north.

1687
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:39,110
Wrong way.

1688
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:46,850
Good old north.

1689
02:10:47,110 --> 02:10:47,750
Good old north.

1690
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:53,910
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're going a little sideways.

1691
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:57,950
Whoa, whoa, we're turning.

1692
02:10:58,630 --> 02:10:59,650
Whoa, which way are we facing?

1693
02:11:00,330 --> 02:11:01,970
Whoa, whoa.

1694
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:10,420
How long is this?

1695
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:18,480
What sound was that?

1696
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:19,220
I don't remember.

1697
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:19,920
Huh?

1698
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:24,600
Too long.

1699
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:27,340
Oh, it's cowbell.

1700
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:28,400
Oh, so it's southeast.

1701
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:28,860
Okay.

1702
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:33,860
Oh, sorry.

1703
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:35,060
I didn't mean to press that.

1704
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:40,860
There we go.

1705
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,800
Okay, this should be the last one.

1706
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:54,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1707
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:55,300
That's new, that's new.

1708
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:56,560
That's new!

1709
02:11:57,900 --> 02:12:01,660
New, new, new, new, new, new, new!

1710
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:07,960
Did I make it?

1711
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:13,160
Ooh!

1712
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:24,160
Mist.

1713
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:29,380
The game's puzzles are truly mystifying.

1714
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,060
Oh.

1715
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,260
I wish all my...

1716
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:37,780
I wish all my books had MP4s.

1717
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:41,320
Are we going home?

1718
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:54,800
Oh!

1719
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:05,770
He returned.

1720
02:13:06,990 --> 02:13:07,930
He wouldn't return.

1721
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:11,410
This age is a rescue.

1722
02:13:11,490 --> 02:13:11,930
me

1723
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:21,850
my brother I beg you

1724
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:28,870
to be complete VTuber?

1725
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:30,890
you say are you a VTuber?

1726
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:47,110
always blue pages you listen to him not listen to my brother
say don't listen to him or listen to him Oh, just kidding.

1727
02:13:48,670 --> 02:13:51,330
He says don't listen to me.

1728
02:13:51,490 --> 02:13:52,450
Don't bring the red ones.

1729
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:00,550
Prisons?

1730
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,100
I will have my retribution.

1731
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:10,760
Pages!

1732
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,180
The pages!

1733
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:25,650
Well that made a whole lot of...

1734
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:28,090
That was a whole lot of A whole lot of nonsense, huh, guys?

1735
02:14:30,130 --> 02:14:31,090
Don't listen to my brother.

1736
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:32,350
Only bring blue pages.

1737
02:14:32,490 --> 02:14:34,270
I've been wrongly imprisoned, basically.

1738
02:14:34,450 --> 02:14:35,230
Okay, okay.

1739
02:14:35,790 --> 02:14:37,170
Thank you for the TL notes.

1740
02:14:40,010 --> 02:14:40,910
No, thank you for the...

1741
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:44,310
Wait, but we have a red page we can go grab.

1742
02:14:47,850 --> 02:14:50,170
Wait, would I have to do all that, though, to get back?

1743
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:52,770
Wait, where's my ship?

1744
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:56,110
Oh, it's here, yeah.

1745
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:01,120
I would have to do everything again.

1746
02:15:07,780 --> 02:15:09,740
And by everything, I mean the...

1747
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,140
The subway.

1748
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:19,250
Are there multiple endings to this game?

1749
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,840
There are!

1750
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,620
No, four endings!

1751
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:33,200
Three!

1752
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,700
Three, four endings?

1753
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:42,160
Wow.

1754
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:45,580
Including the secret one.

1755
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:47,560
Oh my gosh.

1756
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:49,780
Wait, I didn't know Mist was such like a...

1757
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:50,160
Why?

1758
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:51,240
I feel like there...

1759
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:53,740
Why has there never been like a TV show based on this?

1760
02:16:07,850 --> 02:16:09,690
Because people are lame.

1761
02:16:10,150 --> 02:16:10,470
Why?

1762
02:16:14,770 --> 02:16:17,470
Several books and sequels instead.

1763
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:27,800
Oh wait, we gotta get this too.

1764
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:30,680
Uh, this rotation.

1765
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:34,860
Let's go, let's go figure that out because I forgot to do it
before.

1766
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:37,840
If it's, if it's even a thing, you know.

1767
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,020
Let's go see.

1768
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:44,120
Uh, you.

1769
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:47,040
Oh my god.

1770
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:47,680
Oh, sorry.

1771
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:48,500
Oh my god.

1772
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:48,860
Sorry.

1773
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:49,860
Oh my god.

1774
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:57,720
That's it, right?

1775
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:00,520
I'm so sorry!

1776
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:11,680
Alright, let's go tower rotate.

1777
02:17:31,850 --> 02:17:32,310
Awesome.

1778
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:44,920
is actually really dark and messed up.

1779
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:46,480
Is there cannibalism?

1780
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:49,280
Is there...

1781
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:49,800
Let's see.

1782
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:53,980
Big tree.

1783
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:01,920
724.

1784
02:18:08,030 --> 02:18:08,110
Wait!

1785
02:18:08,370 --> 02:18:10,450
That must be the code for the safe in there.

1786
02:18:13,570 --> 02:18:15,910
That's a question I cannot answer in good faith.

1787
02:18:18,710 --> 02:18:19,890
Yeah, yeah.

1788
02:18:20,510 --> 02:18:23,690
Hmm, your silence tells me everything.

1789
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:29,550
Which brother eats which?

1790
02:18:37,930 --> 02:18:38,530
Yeah, I don't know.

1791
02:18:38,770 --> 02:18:41,390
I keep playing games with cannibalism.

1792
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:42,570
It's like my thing now.

1793
02:18:46,450 --> 02:18:47,730
I'm like the cannibal YouTuber.

1794
02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:51,890
It's answered in game four.

1795
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:56,970
I have to play four games to get to the cannibalism.

1796
02:18:59,270 --> 02:19:01,410
That should be a main attraction.

1797
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:07,530
If you are what you eat, then the only way to be a person is
to eat a person.

1798
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:11,470
Alright, what was it?

1799
02:19:12,030 --> 02:19:12,430
724.

1800
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:20,300
Where are these?

1801
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:21,680
A match.

1802
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:24,340
I'm gonna burn it all to...

1803
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:25,720
I'm gonna burn it all to hell.

1804
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:27,420
Oh, I gotta light this baby.

1805
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:35,900
Uh...

1806
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:44,810
Uh...

1807
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:47,450
What do you want me to do with it?

1808
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:53,420
Do I have to use the thing here?

1809
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,620
Ah, okay.

1810
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:02,610
Does that do it?

1811
02:20:07,530 --> 02:20:09,070
Mitt, you know how matches work?

1812
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:10,190
I don't...

1813
02:20:10,190 --> 02:20:11,950
I didn't think about it, okay?

1814
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:34,330
That seems kind of strong.

1815
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:51,290
I'm gonna save fire.

1816
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:55,330
Before we continue.

1817
02:20:55,470 --> 02:20:55,810
There we go.

1818
02:20:55,970 --> 02:20:56,270
All right.

1819
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:04,260
This isn't moving, though, up here.

1820
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:07,100
So maybe...

1821
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:10,000
Should I shut the door?

1822
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:10,720
Alright.

1823
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:24,520
Huh.

1824
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:27,920
I want to go to the clock.

1825
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:38,940
All things are happening.

1826
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:48,920
Looks like there's an eyeball in there looking at me.

1827
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:49,560
Freaky.

1828
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:56,840
Oh, there's autosave.

1829
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:57,640
It's still there.

1830
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,280
In case you were wondering.

1831
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:01,380
In case you were like, um.

1832
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:03,220
Because I also was curious.

1833
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:10,040
More.

1834
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:11,140
More.

1835
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:20,720
There's also a face in the safe.

1836
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:30,660
Now when I don't see it.

1837
02:22:33,850 --> 02:22:34,230
Whoa!

1838
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:36,770
Um...

1839
02:22:37,150 --> 02:22:37,530
Oh!

1840
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:43,380
Something exploded!

1841
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:44,700
Oh!

1842
02:22:48,070 --> 02:22:49,170
What explode?

1843
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:53,150
What's exploding?

1844
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:01,680
Go to the tree.

1845
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:03,740
How do I get the tree?

1846
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:16,100
Uh, uh, behind the cabin.

1847
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:19,060
It's so difficult getting to the tree.

1848
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:21,080
Oh my god.

1849
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:22,940
Wait, uh, Buck.

1850
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:24,240
Oh, there we are.

1851
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,700
I didn't even know this existed.

1852
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:28,680
Okay.

1853
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:58,720
I feel like we should be able to go up higher, no?

1854
02:24:02,860 --> 02:24:03,220
God,

1855
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:13,340
there's so many tiny things you can miss.

1856
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,680
Oh, this is what I saw from the deck.

1857
02:24:16,340 --> 02:24:17,660
Because I was like, I definitely...

1858
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:19,440
I was like, I...

1859
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:25,550
This is a timing puzzle.

1860
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:27,370
Oh my god.

1861
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:32,600
Oh,

1862
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:41,120
I see, I see it, okay, but...

1863
02:24:51,130 --> 02:24:52,590
Do I need to press it?

1864
02:24:55,510 --> 02:25:00,490
We're gathered here today to remember Mintventum, who died
again tragically in a steam boiler explosion.

1865
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:02,410
I was wicked crazy and cynical.

1866
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:05,870
One.

1867
02:25:31,570 --> 02:25:33,050
Oh my gosh, if I could get over.

1868
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:33,490
There we go.

1869
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:38,240
Wait, where's the door?

1870
02:25:40,380 --> 02:25:41,340
It's rotating.

1871
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:47,060
Look up?

1872
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:49,080
Um, I don't think that's possible.

1873
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:55,060
How do I look up?

1874
02:26:11,060 --> 02:26:12,800
It must be way gone then.

1875
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:15,080
Gamers don't look up.

1876
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:18,820
Miss...

1877
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,560
Miss...

1878
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:20,240
Miss...

1879
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:20,600
Miss...

1880
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:21,900
Miss Man, don't look up.

1881
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,880
Get closer and click on the top of the screen.

1882
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:31,880
What do you think I did?

1883
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:35,340
Oh!

1884
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:36,520
There it is.

1885
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:40,080
Is it still going up?

1886
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:45,740
Did it stop?

1887
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:52,940
Or...

1888
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:56,260
Do I have to just like, sit in... Do I have to...

1889
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:58,000
Okay, so let's turn this off, then.

1890
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:14,800
Oh.

1891
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:17,520
Okay, there we go.

1892
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:23,180
Oh, I think that was the sound of it.

1893
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:24,300
Oh my gosh, it's...

1894
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:24,980
There it comes.

1895
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:27,080
Ah!

1896
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:28,480
That's so fun.

1897
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:38,380
You think it'll go back up, though?

1898
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,820
Probably not, right?

1899
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:44,740
Oh,

1900
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:51,800
I need to go down!

1901
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:52,420
Oh!

1902
02:27:57,520 --> 02:27:59,580
I thought I was going to the top of the tree!

1903
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:05,880
Tree!

1904
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:07,200
Tree world!

1905
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:09,120
Whoa, whoa!

1906
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:10,620
We're gonna be a little monkey!

1907
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:23,930
Let's go!

1908
02:28:25,070 --> 02:28:25,890
This

1909
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:31,240
is the channel wood book.

1910
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:31,580
Yeah!

1911
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:33,940
Oh my gosh.

1912
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:34,460
Can I go in?

1913
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,130
Let's go.

1914
02:28:38,220 --> 02:28:38,640
Yeah!

1915
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:46,150
Whoa.

1916
02:28:50,310 --> 02:28:51,170
Oh boy.

1917
02:28:52,710 --> 02:28:55,810
I'm messing with the local ecosystem.

1918
02:28:57,710 --> 02:28:59,530
I'm disrupting the flow.

1919
02:29:01,030 --> 02:29:03,830
I'm pulling levers and pressing buttons!

1920
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:11,670
The toilet?

1921
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:18,580
I think I need power.

1922
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:23,160
Welcome to the bayou.

1923
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:31,220
What we got going on up here?

1924
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:39,730
Interesting.

1925
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:42,430
Will we find my Oshi Frog Bird?

1926
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:46,370
That guy wouldn't dare step in a...

1927
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:52,570
In such a disgusting place.

1928
02:29:53,850 --> 02:29:54,250
Wait.

1929
02:29:56,850 --> 02:29:57,510
Okay, that way.

1930
02:29:57,910 --> 02:30:00,650
I thought the shadow, it looked like it was like building up
water.

1931
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:11,500
How do I distribute the water to here?

1932
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:12,980
I think that's what I need to do.

1933
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:14,440
No, or...

1934
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:15,460
Let's try over here.

1935
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:20,560
What's this one?

1936
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:24,500
No.

1937
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:27,420
This is probably the friendliest zone.

1938
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,720
Is it?

1939
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:34,520
I'm getting freaked out by the frog sounds.

1940
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:45,350
Hmm.

1941
02:30:47,710 --> 02:30:48,430
The easiest?

1942
02:30:48,570 --> 02:30:49,190
Don't say that.

1943
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:51,690
Because when I can't figure it out, I'll feel really stupid.

1944
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:07,180
Let's see.

1945
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:08,660
I want to try to get over there.

1946
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:11,840
This area.

1947
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:12,600
Yeah.

1948
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:13,880
Yeah.

1949
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:17,040
Oh, it's locked.

1950
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:30,270
Yeah.

1951
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:32,870
I hear you running.

1952
02:31:33,610 --> 02:31:34,510
I hear you working.

1953
02:31:35,730 --> 02:31:36,590
You're literally...

1954
02:31:36,590 --> 02:31:37,050
Come on.

1955
02:31:37,850 --> 02:31:38,230
Work.

1956
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:43,050
You have generator sound now.

1957
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,440
Maybe I'll...

1958
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:01,600
Wait.

1959
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:11,360
I can't even tell where I'm at.

1960
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:14,840
That's, I think, the most confusing part about this place
for me.

1961
02:32:14,860 --> 02:32:26,650
me is it looks everywhere looks so similar so i'm gonna get
lost like how i feel yeah this guy's not making any noise

1962
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:29,730
where was the other one

1963
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:44,790
uh let's go back this way what's over here a tree all right
all right all right all right

1964
02:32:52,980 --> 02:32:56,200
This one is way easier in the 3D versions.

1965
02:32:57,960 --> 02:32:59,000
I can imagine.

1966
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:01,460
I'm like lost as hell right now.

1967
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:03,780
I'm not gonna be that... I'm not gonna lie.

1968
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:07,840
There's two of these though!

1969
02:33:07,940 --> 02:33:08,240
No!

1970
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:09,120
Am I dumb?

1971
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:12,740
Was it just the one this whole time?

1972
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:14,660
Oh, it was just the one this whole time.

1973
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:16,820
Okay, okay, alright.

1974
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:18,820
We gotta figure out how to get the water over here.

1975
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:21,920
I keep getting turned around though.

1976
02:33:22,660 --> 02:33:23,920
Where am I?

1977
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:31,860
Follow the sound of the water and you'll be fine.

1978
02:33:32,300 --> 02:33:32,300
Okay.

1979
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,120
So now we're making it go this way, I'm assuming.

1980
02:33:53,180 --> 02:33:54,200
Let me make it go this way?

1981
02:33:59,460 --> 02:33:59,900
And

1982
02:34:04,340 --> 02:34:04,780
then...

1983
02:34:04,780 --> 02:34:05,180
Ah!

1984
02:34:05,380 --> 02:34:05,980
I did it!

1985
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:10,370
I didn't do it.

1986
02:34:12,550 --> 02:34:12,990
Ah!

1987
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:13,870
Maybe I hold it?

1988
02:34:14,510 --> 02:34:15,830
Do I shut the... this?

1989
02:34:16,830 --> 02:34:17,030
Oh!

1990
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:23,210
Shit!

1991
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:27,810
We made it.

1992
02:34:29,290 --> 02:34:31,150
I'm in someone's home, maybe.

1993
02:34:32,010 --> 02:34:32,570
Oh my god.

1994
02:34:33,210 --> 02:34:34,410
I can't tell where I am at all.

1995
02:34:36,150 --> 02:34:36,590
Okay.

1996
02:34:40,410 --> 02:34:41,450
Where did I come from?

1997
02:34:42,090 --> 02:34:42,530
Oh god.

1998
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:43,710
Oh god.

1999
02:34:43,870 --> 02:34:44,830
Point and click adventure.

2000
02:34:45,570 --> 02:34:46,490
Point and click adventure.

2001
02:34:48,030 --> 02:34:50,990
I wonder if kids who grew up playing puzzle games got an
unrealistic...

2002
02:34:51,170 --> 02:34:55,030
Unrealistic expectation of having to solve puzzles all day
as an adult.

2003
02:34:58,670 --> 02:35:01,250
I mean, weren't you a kid once?

2004
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:21,280
This is someone's home!

2005
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:24,860
Let's go this way.

2006
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:26,760
Someone else is home!

2007
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:29,460
It's their home!

2008
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:31,400
Wow, this person loved pottery!

2009
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:33,900
They loved pottery.

2010
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:36,660
Like, I'm pottery's biggest fan.

2011
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:39,420
No other bigger fan of pottery than I.

2012
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,240
I'm the pottery creature.

2013
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:44,380
What's this?

2014
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:49,080
What the hell did that just do?

2015
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:52,940
Oh, I think it opened the door?

2016
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:55,320
Over there?

2017
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:02,020
Pottery creature.

2018
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:06,220
Okay, nice.

2019
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:08,460
Open the door, I think, for the...

2020
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:15,700
um spiral staircase so let's go back to pottery this way

2021
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:27,840
i'm looking for pages even too i gotta find me a blue page

2022
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:28,780

2023
02:36:31,800 --> 02:36:33,820

don't know it's so hard to see I don't even know where that

2027
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:20,800
was, that little switch.

2028
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:23,500
It's really hard to see.

2029
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:28,600
You guys see as well as I do, so...

2030
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,320
If I can't tell, if you can't tell, I can't tell.

2031
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,280
I'm Patrick Swayze.

2032
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:40,640
I mean, Patrick Swayze is a ghost now.

2033
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:44,400
Not every dead person turns into a ghost.

2034
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:47,980
I don't think that guy's a ghost at all.

2035
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:49,120
I don't know.

2036
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:49,760
I don't know him.

2037
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:52,300
I lost the lever.

2038
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:54,260
Didn't he die?

2039
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:56,220
I thought so.

2040
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:05,800
I'm so lost.

2041
02:38:05,940 --> 02:38:06,080
Wait.

2042
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:07,540
Pottery.

2043
02:38:09,220 --> 02:38:10,560
From pottery.

2044
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:11,260
Here.

2045
02:38:16,850 --> 02:38:17,710
I can't tell.

2046
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:24,840
I don't think I'm Patrick Swayze.

2047
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:26,960
What?

2048
02:38:27,220 --> 02:38:27,360
What?

2049
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:27,640
What?

2050
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:29,040
I only know him from Ghost.

2051
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:30,540
What else has he done?

2052
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:37,440
What else has Patrick Swayze done?

2053
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:42,760
That I could maybe steal for my resume.

2054
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:44,260
Say that it was me.

2055
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:46,020
If I'm Patrick Swayze.

2056
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:48,580
Roadhouse.

2057
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:49,840
Oh, dirty dancing!

2058
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:52,820
We're dirty dancing!

2059
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:54,520
Dirty dancing!

2060
02:38:54,860 --> 02:39:04,880
We're dirty, and we're dancing, we're Dirty dancing, and
that's Dirty Dan, and I'm Dirty dancing with Dirty Dan, and

2061
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:13,800
we're Dirty dancing, that's the plan, and we're Dirty
dancing till we can't, we're Dirty dancing.

2062
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:15,800
I opened the door.

2063
02:39:24,430 --> 02:39:28,110
So that elevator there, where does it lead to?

2064
02:39:28,350 --> 02:39:29,610
It's like right next door.

2065
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:39,900
I can't believe you memorized the lyrics.

2066
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:42,260
It's like I'm the biggest fan of that song.

2067
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:45,820
So one of the first games I ever played on PC.

2068
02:39:46,420 --> 02:39:48,400
I'm not counting Putt Putt goes to the moon.

2069
02:39:50,580 --> 02:39:52,120
Super excited to see you playing this.

2070
02:39:52,180 --> 02:39:52,980
Thank you, Kane!

2071
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:56,360
Thank you!

2072
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:08,250
I guess this one doesn't matter, huh?

2073
02:40:09,010 --> 02:40:11,190
Wait, if I do that...

2074
02:40:12,670 --> 02:40:32,360
you don't even like see it leaking okay all right and then
here like that okay now this i just want to see what the

2075
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:33,180
elevator does

2076
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:46,060
i feel oh it goes up here i thought it was okay i i don't I
don't know why I was like, they only go up and down.

2077
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:49,260
I didn't realize there was like so many layers.

2078
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:53,420
I guess they did say that in the book, huh?

2079
02:40:56,040 --> 02:40:56,520
Oh.

2080
02:40:59,320 --> 02:40:59,800
Oh!

2081
02:41:02,140 --> 02:41:02,620
Oh!

2082
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:05,020
Oh!

2083
02:41:05,020 --> 02:41:06,760
Uh, we're just gonna forget that happened?

2084
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:09,180
What the?

2085
02:41:10,180 --> 02:41:10,660
Oh!

2086
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:15,920
Oh!

2087
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:17,460
Oh!

2088
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:33,720
Whatever he got paid, it wasn't enough.

2089
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:39,680
Oh my gosh, it's a trap!

2090
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,440
I like how we just leave and are like, okay!

2091
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:52,660
Wait.

2092
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:55,240
Wait, there was this...

2093
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:00,150
Okay, this is where I came from, okay.

2094
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:05,620
Just trying to get my bearings, you know?

2095
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:11,940
So he was just speaking the creature language, the
tree-dweller language.

2096
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:21,080
Okay, let's go this way.

2097
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:31,600
What's in here?

2098
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:32,980
Oh, a thing.

2099
02:42:34,940 --> 02:42:35,980
Oh, blue bear.

2100
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,700
Blue page, blue page!

2101
02:42:58,810 --> 02:42:59,610
Zanzibar.

2102
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:05,970
Now that's Patrick Swayze.

2103
02:43:12,810 --> 02:43:14,690
What did that mouth do?

2104
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:20,580
Oh!

2105
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:34,220

2107
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:07,300
Brother, I hope I'm not writing over anything important.

2108
02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:08,300
Brother?

2109
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:11,740
Interesting.

2110
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:15,120
Naruhodo.

2111
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:17,480
Naruhodo took.

2112
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:21,700
The music in there is so whimsical.

2113
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:23,540
Wait, go back.

2114
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:25,320
Oh, I thought there was a door here.

2115
02:44:30,380 --> 02:44:31,020
Um...

2116
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:33,240
Was there anything else I missed?

2117
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:34,600
Oh, this way.

2118
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:38,520
Whoa, fancy room!

2119
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:39,300
Whoa!

2120
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:40,900
Oh, this must be the brother's room.

2121
02:44:42,780 --> 02:44:43,620
This is the brother.

2122
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:45,760
Open your drawers.

2123
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:47,100
A knife.

2124
02:44:47,800 --> 02:44:48,360
A knife.

2125
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:54,540
Missed.

2126
02:44:55,140 --> 02:44:56,220
Switches on the island.

2127
02:44:57,820 --> 02:44:58,180
Mmm.

2128
02:44:59,500 --> 02:45:01,560
Vault access, you say?

2129
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:05,160
Vault access, you say?

2130
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:06,200
I'm taking a picture of this.

2131
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:13,300
Alright.

2132
02:45:14,380 --> 02:45:15,280
Took a picture of that?

2133
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:18,440
Very good.

2134
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:19,840
What's over here?

2135
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:21,120
A sink.

2136
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:22,220
And his toothbrush?

2137
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:24,620
He's so sophisticated.

2138
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:28,300
He's so like, I don't participate in your...

2139
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:29,860
Monkey business.

2140
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:30,980
That's what he says.

2141
02:45:31,820 --> 02:45:32,780
The red page.

2142
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:33,820
I think I'm about...

2143
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:34,980
Blue Page guy.

2144
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,460
I think I'm Team Blue Page.

2145
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:45,260
Oh, no running water.

2146
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:46,600
You're...

2147
02:45:49,370 --> 02:45:51,270
I don't have to go all the way down.

2148
02:45:57,720 --> 02:45:59,040
I think this is cheese?

2149
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:00,160
I couldn't even tell.

2150
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:01,900
I think you're right.

2151
02:46:06,430 --> 02:46:06,850
You don't?

2152
02:46:06,910 --> 02:46:07,330
It's fine.

2153
02:46:07,410 --> 02:46:08,270
Okay, thank goodness.

2154
02:46:08,590 --> 02:46:08,790
Thank you.

2155
02:46:10,050 --> 02:46:12,650
I do kind of want to see the other side.

2156
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:17,470
But at the same time, I'm like, I'd have to...

2157
02:46:17,470 --> 02:46:19,310
Wait, it wouldn't let me grab anything, though.

2158
02:46:27,700 --> 02:46:29,940
But I would have to come back to all these worlds.

2159
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:31,640
That's the only thing stopping me.

2160
02:46:34,300 --> 02:46:35,640
You don't want the page, do you?

2161
02:46:36,940 --> 02:46:38,240
Is that what you desire?

2162
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:43,840
Definitely the page and not my hand.

2163
02:46:49,930 --> 02:46:59,730
yeah when they say aged cheese whose room is this oh this
must be Eustace's room blue man yeah yeah because he has the

2164
02:46:59,730 --> 02:47:03,690
thing oh

2165
02:47:07,220 --> 02:47:09,400
oh okay it's just jail

2166
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:20,100
it's only one world that is annoying to redo for the second
page I haven't been here long so I don't if you've been

2167
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:25,540
there i don't know i've been to is it the one with the
subway because if so yes

2168
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:42,950

seeing something is what i mean because i can't go anywhere

2169
02:47:42,950 --> 02:48:02,430
else you got everything here wait how do i leave then How do
I get home?

2170
02:48:05,490 --> 02:48:07,230
There's just the way home.

2171
02:48:10,370 --> 02:48:10,770
Which

2172
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:15,900
is...

2173
02:48:15,900 --> 02:48:16,840
Oh, the first...

2174
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:20,260
Oh, sorry, I'm still like...

2175
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:21,260
Oh, wait, wrong way.

2176
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:26,940
I'm still learning the games, like, what it wants me to do a
little bit, still.

2177
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:29,540
I guess there's no book?

2178
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:32,460
Yeah, that's what I was looking for, was, like, a book or
something.

2179
02:48:34,180 --> 02:48:34,620
Hmm.

2180
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:40,980
How do I get downstairs from here?

2181
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:41,940
Oh, wait.

2182
02:48:42,040 --> 02:48:42,820
I can take the...

2183
02:48:42,820 --> 02:48:43,240
I'm stupid.

2184
02:48:44,460 --> 02:48:46,060
I can take the stairs.

2185
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:52,140
You're doing great.

2186
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:53,440
Aw, thanks, guys.

2187
02:48:54,920 --> 02:48:55,920
I'm having fun.

2188
02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:00,240
I was worried that I would be like, oh, my gosh, I'm way too
stupid for this game.

2189
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:05,040
But only so far, I'm just a little bit stupid for it.

2190
02:49:05,800 --> 02:49:07,060
Where is the elevator?

2191
02:49:32,730 --> 02:49:34,810
How do I get home, everybody?

2192
02:49:35,530 --> 02:49:36,370
I'm doing really good.

2193
02:49:36,750 --> 02:49:37,370
Thank you!

2194
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:41,450
You're one of the most big, big brain gamers I've seen.

2195
02:49:41,610 --> 02:49:42,090
Wow!

2196
02:49:46,690 --> 02:49:48,190
I don't know how to get home, though.

2197
02:49:50,370 --> 02:49:51,710
Elevator is ground level.

2198
02:49:52,850 --> 02:49:54,130
Is this not the ground level?

2199
02:49:55,290 --> 02:49:55,830
Is there more ground?

2200
02:49:55,930 --> 02:49:57,090
Is there under sea level?

2201
02:50:06,340 --> 02:50:06,780
Ground.

2202
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,280
Wait, it wasn't in the ground.

2203
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:12,100
Wait, oh.

2204
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:16,540
It's not this one.

2205
02:50:16,640 --> 02:50:18,280
This one led upstairs.

2206
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:20,380
Maybe it's over here.

2207
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:23,780
Oh, I think it's this one then.

2208
02:50:23,940 --> 02:50:25,680
Okay, we gotta direct the water over here.

2209
02:50:36,470 --> 02:50:38,210
I was wondering what that was for.

2210
02:50:38,390 --> 02:50:39,690
I didn't...

2211
02:50:40,030 --> 02:50:43,030
I knew how we got down here and yeah, I still was like...

2212
02:50:43,730 --> 02:50:44,550
I don't know.

2213
02:50:51,190 --> 02:50:52,310
This one?

2214
02:50:53,050 --> 02:50:55,690
Wait, I have to be looking at it.

2215
02:50:56,730 --> 02:50:57,330
This way.

2216
02:50:58,210 --> 02:50:59,410
No, no, please!

2217
02:51:00,190 --> 02:51:01,290
Please let me click you!

2218
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:03,230
Wait, uh...

2219
02:51:03,230 --> 02:51:04,970
Wait, uh...

2220
02:51:04,970 --> 02:51:05,950
Wait, I'm lost.

2221
02:51:07,790 --> 02:51:08,770
This, this way.

2222
02:51:11,150 --> 02:51:11,710
Okay.

2223
02:51:15,620 --> 02:51:17,300
This way!

2224
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:29,180
I did it wrong.

2225
02:51:41,220 --> 02:51:42,540
Oh, that's why.

2226
02:51:43,820 --> 02:51:44,500
My bad.

2227
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:48,120
My bad.

2228
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:49,900
There we go.

2229
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:51,600
Oh!

2230
02:51:53,480 --> 02:51:54,300
Neat!

2231
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:57,220
Oh!

2232
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:03,360
How did I get over here?

2233
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:15,180
wait how do i get home though the water is broke oh i have
to cry

2234
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:26,340
oh my god oh my god we gotta go all the way back oh weeks of
fun weeks of fun

2235
02:52:29,780 --> 02:52:34,480
okay from here wait from here Where am I?

2236
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:34,980
I'm lost.

2237
02:52:37,740 --> 02:52:39,780
We go to this way now.

2238
02:52:43,540 --> 02:52:44,780
I don't hear the water though.

2239
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:46,420
Where's the water?

2240
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:47,480
Oh, I think the water is here.

2241
02:52:49,500 --> 02:52:49,700
Okay.

2242
02:52:52,820 --> 02:52:53,700
Wait, uh...

2243
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:54,080
Sorry.

2244
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:54,720
Oh my gosh.

2245
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:55,280
Oh, yes.

2246
02:52:59,380 --> 02:52:59,820
Yes?

2247
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:04,400
Okay, back around!

2248
02:53:07,420 --> 02:53:08,500
Oh my gosh.

2249
02:53:09,560 --> 02:53:10,880
Oh my gosh.

2250
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:13,040
What if you have to pee?

2251
02:53:13,400 --> 02:53:14,800
I guess you just pee in the water, huh?

2252
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:17,940
But like, what if you really have to go?

2253
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:20,960
You're like, I just want the comfort of my own.

2254
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:25,280
I want the comfort of my own bathroom.

2255
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:30,840
Always finding ways to crank it in games.

2256
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:33,200
Oh man, that one wasn't so bad though.

2257
02:53:33,820 --> 02:53:34,920
It's just disorienting.

2258
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:37,300
That's my biggest...

2259
02:53:40,480 --> 02:53:41,730
My biggest enemy.

2260
02:53:46,130 --> 02:53:48,450
Oh, there's the boy!

2261
02:53:51,950 --> 02:53:52,610
There!

2262
02:53:57,610 --> 02:54:01,710
Yeah, the 3D remake I can imagine makes us so much easier.

2263
02:54:02,270 --> 02:54:05,310
But it feels like classic doing it like this, you know?

2264
02:54:07,170 --> 02:54:08,370
Ah, yeah.

2265
02:54:08,710 --> 02:54:09,310
Ah, yeah.

2266
02:54:09,890 --> 02:54:11,790
Wait, what time is my meeting tonight?

2267
02:54:12,450 --> 02:54:15,330
Sorry, I'm meeting with the other Den Setsu girls for
something.

2268
02:54:15,550 --> 02:54:17,370
Let me, before we watch it, let me make sure.

2269
02:54:18,070 --> 02:54:18,250
Oops.

2270
02:54:19,890 --> 02:54:22,050
Because otherwise, we can just finish the game tomorrow.

2271
02:54:24,990 --> 02:54:26,610
A VTuber playing Myst!

2272
02:54:27,790 --> 02:54:28,570
Hello, hello!

2273
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:32,450
Okay, yeah, after this, I think I might...

2274
02:54:32,450 --> 02:54:36,030
I had a meeting earlier, literally right before stream with
Steiner.

2275
02:54:36,790 --> 02:54:44,270
like a weekly kind of catch-up meeting with my manager and
then tonight, me and the Den Setu girls are meeting to

2276
02:54:44,270 --> 02:54:52,610
discuss some cool stuff, so you've made great progress for
one night if you've got to stop.

2277
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:58,350
Yeah, unfortunately, we're meeting in about an hour and I
kind of want to eat before then.

2278
02:54:58,410 --> 02:54:59,870
I think this is a good stopping point.

2279
02:55:00,670 --> 02:55:03,950
If you guys say we're 50% through the game, we can finish it
tomorrow.

2280
02:55:08,550 --> 02:55:09,710
Yeah, I'm good.

2281
02:55:09,830 --> 02:55:13,470
Two more pages, I got you.

2282
02:55:15,190 --> 02:55:15,710
Bring more.

2283
02:55:17,710 --> 02:55:18,230
You need more.

2284
02:55:18,390 --> 02:55:18,730
You need more.

2285
02:55:19,450 --> 02:55:20,490
Well, I ask of you.

2286
02:55:21,390 --> 02:55:21,830
Okay.

2287
02:55:22,970 --> 02:55:23,210
More.

2288
02:55:23,910 --> 02:55:25,770
It's so long since my brother...

2289
02:55:25,770 --> 02:55:28,630
Serious wrongfully amazes into me within this walk.

2290
02:55:29,250 --> 02:55:30,770
Oh, stupid schemes.

2291
02:55:33,370 --> 02:55:35,410
They were like Mac filters.

2292
02:55:40,690 --> 02:55:42,390
Breathe, which is endless.

2293
02:55:43,870 --> 02:55:44,630
What's endless?

2294
02:55:45,310 --> 02:55:47,850
It should be perfectly obvious to you.

2295
02:55:49,690 --> 02:55:52,530
He's done evil and he has destroyed all before.

2296
02:55:54,490 --> 02:55:57,730
Do not bring the red pages to him.

2297
02:55:57,990 --> 02:55:58,490
Please.

2298
02:55:59,690 --> 02:56:00,930
Not let him trip you.

2299
02:56:01,570 --> 02:56:02,010
You believe me?

2300
02:56:03,450 --> 02:56:05,050
Please say, tell me.

2301
02:56:06,790 --> 02:56:07,410
Huh?

2302
02:56:10,710 --> 02:56:12,550
He seriously murdered my father!

2303
02:56:12,830 --> 02:56:18,110
He murdered your dad!

2304
02:56:20,050 --> 02:56:23,630
He murdered their dad!

2305
02:56:24,550 --> 02:56:27,510
Okay, okay, this guy's yapping up a storm.

2306
02:56:28,770 --> 02:56:29,810
Listen, you must obey.

2307
02:56:30,690 --> 02:56:33,110
Oh, I don't like the word obey though.

2308
02:56:34,390 --> 02:56:36,450
Ages are my only hope.

2309
02:56:36,910 --> 02:56:37,950
You must help me.

2310
02:56:38,350 --> 02:56:39,030
Help me.

2311
02:56:44,180 --> 02:56:47,260
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over again.

2312
02:56:48,980 --> 02:56:50,020
What was that about their father?

2313
02:56:50,300 --> 02:56:52,420
The brother murdered their father?

2314
02:56:52,600 --> 02:56:53,300
Is that what he said?

2315
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:54,600
So this guy?

2316
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:02,520
He murdered their father?

2317
02:57:04,340 --> 02:57:04,940
Allegedly.

2318
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:09,140
How might Detective Brett Alegon handle this situation?

2319
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:12,000
It's so good seeing you play this.

2320
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,280
You can play through all six games.

2321
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:21,680
Well, I did not intend on that.

2322
02:57:23,620 --> 02:57:27,120
In fact, I only learned that there were more than one today.

2323
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:35,900
Today I learned there was more than one missed game.

2324
02:57:40,900 --> 02:57:42,260
But, uh...

2325
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:43,500
We'll see.

2326
02:57:43,940 --> 02:57:44,240
We'll see.

2327
02:57:44,440 --> 02:57:44,640
We'll see.

2328
02:57:45,560 --> 02:57:48,280
I think we made good progress today, though.

2329
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:52,900
We still have stuff about these constellations.

2330
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:56,820
We still have all of these little critters.

2331
02:57:57,120 --> 02:58:00,040
We still have the pipes over there.

2332
02:58:01,820 --> 02:58:09,000
I think probably I'll start the next stream with getting the
red pages and then continuing from there.

2333
02:58:09,140 --> 02:58:11,940
Actually, I don't even know where to go from here.

2334
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:14,400
We did the spaceship.

2335
02:58:15,440 --> 02:58:16,740
I'll figure it out, I suppose.

2336
02:58:19,220 --> 02:58:21,380
Riven is hard, but incredible.

2337
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:25,220
That's the sequel to this one.

2338
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:28,860
Oh, yeah, we got the Metal Gears.

2339
02:58:29,180 --> 02:58:29,620
That's right.

2340
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:35,120
Imagine being in prison, pleading for help, and the person
on the other side rolls her eyes and says, Yep, yep, yep.

2341
02:58:36,380 --> 02:58:38,100
Happy one year anniversary of Endothuse, right?

2342
02:58:38,440 --> 02:58:38,680
Yeah!

2343
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:42,740
Was going through my photos and remembering what a great
time it was.

2344
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:43,860
Thank you!

2345
02:58:43,960 --> 02:58:45,400
Thank you, thank you!

2346
02:58:46,680 --> 02:58:48,200
Ribbon, the sequel to Mist.

2347
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:49,800
Oh, okay, okay.

2348
02:58:55,060 --> 02:58:57,160
Tell the denser to girlies, you said hi.

2349
02:58:57,540 --> 02:58:58,440
I will.

2350
02:58:58,940 --> 02:59:00,460
Dorgo, thank you so much for the pink!

2351
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:02,240
It was fun.

2352
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:05,300
Watch your mega mind minke gameplay.

2353
02:59:05,740 --> 02:59:06,180
You did great.

2354
02:59:06,260 --> 02:59:07,220
Looking forward to next time.

2355
02:59:07,400 --> 02:59:09,000
Have fun discussing cool stuff in your meeting.

2356
02:59:09,900 --> 02:59:11,540
But please make sure to sleep tonight too.

2357
02:59:11,620 --> 02:59:12,960
Yes, I will sleep tonight.

2358
02:59:13,460 --> 02:59:13,860
I will.

2359
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:14,540
Ribbon's amazing.

2360
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:15,900
Thank you, RoboCorps!

2361
02:59:16,040 --> 02:59:17,280
Thank you for helping too.

2362
02:59:19,160 --> 02:59:20,590
We'll see if I...

2363
02:59:21,320 --> 02:59:23,940
You know, I don't see why I wouldn't want to play it, but...

2364
02:59:23,940 --> 02:59:26,800
I would look into it.

2365
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:27,660
But yeah!

2366
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:29,720
Let me save before we do anything.

2367
02:59:31,440 --> 02:59:31,900
Save...

2368
02:59:31,900 --> 02:59:34,340
Blue Pages...

2369
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:35,420
Team.

2370
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:37,320
Team Blue Pages.

2371
02:59:40,580 --> 02:59:41,040
Yay!

2372
02:59:41,240 --> 02:59:41,900
Thank you, everybody!

2373
02:59:42,080 --> 02:59:43,460
So, so much!

2374
02:59:44,740 --> 02:59:46,380
exactly at like three hours.

2375
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:47,280
Wowie.

2376
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:48,740
Thank you, everyone!

2377
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:52,420
I had so much fun being a big brain.

2378
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:56,780
Now I can take off my smart glasses and return to being an
idiot.

2379
02:59:58,580 --> 03:00:00,300
You should check out Pissed.

2380
03:00:00,500 --> 03:00:01,660
It's an awful parody.

2381
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:02,680
Oh, God.

2382
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:05,660
I'm dumb again!

2383
03:00:05,780 --> 03:00:06,960
I'm dumb again!

2384
03:00:07,540 --> 03:00:08,300
Thanks, everyone!

2385
03:00:08,480 --> 03:00:11,020
Have a good day, have a good night, and I will see you when
I see you.

2386
03:00:11,360 --> 03:00:13,700
Next time, eat the dashai.

2387
03:00:14,560 --> 03:00:15,460
Bye-bye.

2388
03:00:17,980 --> 03:00:19,960
I'm back to being a bimbo.

2389
03:00:20,260 --> 03:00:21,760
I'm back to being a bimbo.

2390
03:00:22,380 --> 03:00:23,560
I'm just a bimbo.

2391
03:00:23,880 --> 03:00:25,440
I got nothing on in my brain.

2392
03:00:25,820 --> 03:00:27,340
Nothing going on up there.

2393
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:29,360
I'm just thinking about...

2394
03:00:30,060 --> 03:00:30,660
What...

2395
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:31,340
Boys?

2396
03:00:34,520 --> 03:00:35,660
Okay, bye!
