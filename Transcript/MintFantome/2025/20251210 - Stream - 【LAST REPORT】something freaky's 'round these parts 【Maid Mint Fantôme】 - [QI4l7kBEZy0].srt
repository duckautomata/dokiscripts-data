00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,660
Oh gosh.

11
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,340
And these birds, they need to shut up.

12
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,480
Sorry, I have less, they keep coming out and I keep hearing
it over and over again.

13
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,740
That, that part right there.

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,500
Hi, so tired.

00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,420
It's so annoying because, like, the first day always, I'm
like, I'm so good.

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm awake the whole day I got this I have no jet lag And

18
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:27,280
If I do sleep I wake up really early Nice hat Thank you I
thought that maybe This would be appropriate for The beasts

19
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,500
In the forest And

20
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,560
Uh, being...

21
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,940
What are we- what's our job?

22
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,760
Um, what did I get hired to do again?

23
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,740
What's the fire- not a fire watch.

24
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,760
A ranger.

25
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,980
A home home on the range.

26
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
Hello, me too, and viewers like you, my advice for the day
do not get addicted to nasal spray.

27
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,280
Yeah, that's actually a thing people get addicted to is the
nasal sprays.

28
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:16,080
apparently the where the beast there's like there's some
things in this what look here oh what is that what could

29
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:26,160
that be what could that be wait really yeah yeah people get
addicted to like nasal sprays because what's the word

30
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,320
there's a specific ingredient.

31
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,760
It starts with an A, I think.

32
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,800
Raw dog in the time zones is never fine.

33
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,400
Hang in there.

34
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,740
Mean to attack you!

35
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,700
Amphetamine, no.

36
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,860
Apples, no.

37
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,960
Acid, no.

38
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,960
Afrin!

39
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,580
Afrin is the ingredient.

40
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:04,060
Because it like makes your note, if you have a stuffy note,
it makes your nose so clear that people like will constantly

41
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:13,440
use it and sometimes people get addicted what is your go-to
American meal after an overseas trip I'm eating Culver's

42
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:24,440
right now mine is Alfred is the name of a brand oh I didn't
know well that's how little I know about it because I don't

43
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,660
use it um I might go to is Taco Bell.

44
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,120
Whenever I come back from a trip, I'm crazy.

45
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,860
I'm crazing?

46
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,100
I'm crazing.

47
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm crazing.

48
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,780
I'm craving Taco Bell.

49
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,600
Don't get addicted to nasal sprays.

50
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,000
Just do ibuprofen.

51
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Let's do ibuprofen together.

52
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,540
Did you try the Baja Blast Pie?

53
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,520
Wasn't it like a liver?

54
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,580
Wait, what's a limited time thing?

55
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,600
I heard like also places were selling out.

56
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,780
I'm crazing it.

57
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,060
I'm crazing the food.

58
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,180
It's making me crazy.

59
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm craving it so much.

60
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,220
I'm crazing.

61
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,420
She's grazing.

62
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,820
That's my goat.

63
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,720
Can mint be the new Taco Bell mascot?

64
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
I think I like Taco Bell too much.

65
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,520
I think it's like my truest guilty pleasure.

66
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:46,800
fast food that I like Taco Bell too much maybe but my go-to
is either five layer burrito or the crunch wrap supreme

67
00:07:51,880 --> 00:08:08,350
yeah yeah Taco Bell at midnight kind of goes hard yeah yeah
mmm five layers so good I know I know, wait, do they still

68
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,510
have the seven layer?

69
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,650
I remember getting that in the past, too.

70
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,010
Baja Minto.

71
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,550
Yeah, look at my hair.

72
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:19,970
Look at me.

73
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,270
I'm the Baja Blash.

74
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,910
You just blend me up and serve me in a pie.

75
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,670
Happy Thanksgiving.

76
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,930
Seven layers in this economy.

77
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,510
They brought back the seven layer town.

78
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,270
temporarily.

79
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,510
Ah, I see.

80
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,590
I see.

81
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,070
Sponsored by Taco Bill.

82
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,250
Going to Japan for the first time in March.

83
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,370
Any recommendations for dealing with jet lag?

84
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,830
You know, honestly, I don't have jet lag really going over
there.

85
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,910
I only have jet lag when I come back home.

86
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:13,910
But my recommendation is on the plane, if it's nighttime in
Japan, sleep on the plane.

87
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,130
If it's daytime in Japan, stay awake as long as you possibly
can.

88
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,130
Just try to match the schedule on the plane.

89
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,210
It's like my biggest advice.

90
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:28,950
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,230
Some people will just like sleep the whole plane ride.

92
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:37,370
No, that is amateur tactics.

93
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,710
Don't do that.

94
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,510
I know it's tempting because you're like, I just want to, I
just want to get the plane ride over with.

95
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:46,910
No!

96
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,910
You must stay awake if you have to.

97
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,590
Blending Minto for Baha Blast.

98
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,690
Is it worth it?

99
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,530
It's always worth it.

100
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,670
I can never sleep on the plane.

101
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,510
I'm one of those like really, I'm one of those really
embarrassing type of sleepers on the plane.

102
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,770
Beef or chicken.

103
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:19,210
And one of those embarrassing sleepers where like my head
like just starts going forward and then I have to yank

104
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,390
myself up in my sleep.

105
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,490
No, well, thank you so much for that Tony gets it.

106
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,510
Thank you.

107
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,550
It's the only way to catch up on sleep.

108
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,790
I'm telling you though.

109
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,910
You have to.

110
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,770
You have to.

111
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,410
Same?

112
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,570
Oh my gosh.

113
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,490
You're just like me?

114
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,790
Did anyone keep the windows open?

115
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,690
Not this past time, luckily.

116
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,310
You have a half-donut neck thing?

117
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,330
I do, and I always forget it.

118
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,690
I push the sides of my head rest in, so it locks my head in
place.

119
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,110
See, I do that too, but that doesn't help me from going
forward.

120
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:09,450
I can, like, rest my head on the side a little bit, but then
I just slowly...

121
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,350
I slowly start to slump over.

122
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,630
And then when I realize I'm...

123
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,050
I wonder what I look like to people next to me.

124
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,430
Because I'm probably like halfway keeled over.

125
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,470
And then I just suddenly go like...

126
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,230
Like I'm a vampire rising from the dead.

127
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,850
Andre goes like so much!

128
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,830
For the Torigata, thank you!

There's a Taco Bell in Shibuya But I've never...

Yeah, there's a couple Taco Bells around.

They can't clean off the ectoplasm.

153
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,420
No, all you have to do is use an oil-based soap.

154
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,200
I promise.

155
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,200

Densetsu girls on the Densetsu.exe group channel?

figuring it out.

169
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,940
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what to do on Sunday.

170
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,380
I was going to do something.

171
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,900
I was going to do a karaoke, but then I was like, Friday and
Saturday I will be singing and I'm worried that if I'm

172
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,320
singing Friday, Saturday, then my voice will not be good for

That's why you don't hear it anymore.

201
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,460
Oh, oh,

00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:02,740

Wait, please don't have sound.

00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,700
When is this?

205
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,400
When are you?

206
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,360
I can't say the event.

207
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,500
Uh...

208
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,060
Why doesn't your website say when you are?

209
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,780
What's your date?

210
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,780
When are we?

211
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,680
I don't know.

212
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,660
I love the redacted event.

213
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,700
I'm just putting together my own calendar right now.

214
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,520
I'm like, hold on, everybody.

215
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Let me put hold of the stream so that I can do my own
personal...

216
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:12,680
my my booking my let's see when why does nobody ever have a
date oh i think it's august july i don't know i don't know

217
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:26,020

okay um this game last report oh my gosh It's been on my

218
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,820
radar for like months now.

219
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,720
I've been wanting to play it because the aesthetic seems so
neat.

220
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,460
It seems pretty short and pretty spooky.

221
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,160
So I'm just like, I just wanted to try it.

222
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,440
And it's pretty good, yeah.

223
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,200
I don't think it's roguelike.

224
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:53,400
I think it's actually quite story-based.

225
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,640
Yeah, thank you for the vibe.

226
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,500
Thank you.

227
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,440
I don't remember how I found it.

228
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,100
I just sometimes go through, like, Steam.

229
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,840
But it keeps popping up for me, and I keep wanting to play
it.

230
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

231
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,840
I keep getting this game on TikTok that, like, looks so
scary.

232
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,220
But it is a Roblox game.

233
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
But it doesn't look like Roblox.

234
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
I kind of want to try it.

235
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,620
It's like Schwarma Simulator or something.

236
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:38,920
And you have to not sell food to the anomalies and it gets
scary.

237
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,980
Roblox is scary.

238
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,140
Yeah, Roblox is a horror game.

239
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:45,840
Sorry.

240
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,440
Content warning, Roblox.

241
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,540
I'm so sorry.

242
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,160
I don't remember what it's called.

243
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,440
Camilla was playing it yesterday.

244
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,240
Yeah, I think it's like the quote-unquote streamer game at
the moment.

245
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,550
But yeah.

246
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,230
Okay, I watched someone play that.

247
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,370
It looks so fun, does it?

248
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,090
It looks so spooky to me.

249
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,530
But let's play Last Report.

250
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,970
I hope it's not my last report.

251
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,790
I'm retiring.

252
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,030
Tomorrow's my last day.

253
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,770
The goal of all life is death.

254
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,210
Death.

255
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,770
10.34 PM.

256
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,830
Bold.

257
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:42,790
Whoa.

258
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,850
Watch out, buddy.

259
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,770
I might have to like adjust where I am.

260
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,610
I don't know how the UI of this game is.

261
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,410
National Park Among Green Trees.

262
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,070

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,400
Do I turn on the computer?

268
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,580
Oh, let's not do that.

269
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,360

270
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,980
There we go.

275
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,980
Among green trees.

276
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,940
As opposed to red trees.

277
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,780
Blue trees.

278
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:08,080

279
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:10,940
Among.

280
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Among.

281
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,660
Among.

282
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,960

I thought this was a free country.

295
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,940
Park vehicles only in designated areas.

296
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,180
Unauthorized parking can harm the environment and block
access.

297
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,320

298
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,020

Restricted area.

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,160
Authorized access only.

301
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,380
Unauthorized entry risks safety and disruption.

302
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,500
Free illegal parking.

303
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
I can't even park my car on the side of the road!

304

310
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,440
Surely they wouldn't start anything until I've done reading
the tutorial, right?

311
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,400
If people trespass after dark, the freaky ghost will get
them.

312
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,460
What music?

313
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,880
You guys don't hear the ambience, so I need to turn it up.

314
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,500
Can you hear that?

315
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,820

description and click submit.

316

Okay, cool.

318
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,720
If a report is damaged, destroy it using the Shredder.

319
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,860
If the report is over two weeks old, select report.

320
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:48,500
Wait a minute.

321
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,140
Select report is outdated and submit.

322
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,940
The report is old.

323
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,480
Uh.

324
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,500
Any report before January 10th is outdated.

325
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,920
After submitting pass the human test to complete the human
test?

326
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:18,320
Yes Oh my gosh Remember if you watched my stream yesterday I
talked about like this path By the real con that we were

327
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,900
hiking We thought it was just like a tiny little trail But
it ended up becoming like a crazy hiking path One of our

328
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:33,080
friends decided to like run up the path To see if there was
an opening To easily get back to the real con Instead of

329
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:43,300
hiking all the way back to the road And we were like joking
that they were taken over by a skinwalker and that they

330
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,540
would be like, Hello, it is I.

331
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,400
You're a very human friend.

332
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,400
Unfortunately, no Nancy Drew, no robot cats, no ghosts in
the onsen.

333
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,480
So sad.

334
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,160
What is your ghostly wisdom of the day?

335
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,430
is a noisy one.

336
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,890
Yeah, no-no-no-grams.

337
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,170
That's the worst part, right?

338
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,690
Actually, I do have no-no-grams on my phone.

339
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,310
So I did play no-no-grams a little bit.

340
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,570
I had to!

341
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,710
It's like part of the atmosphere.

342
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,590
After I've completed the human test, you can check your
stats in the review track app.

343
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,330
The app refreshes periodically.

344
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:40,190
Oh!

345
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,870
Someone's at the door.

346
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:59,050

00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:42,790

like right here.

351
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,820
Moving down a bit.

352
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,320
We'll see if I have to throw you over to the left side.

353
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,560
The family loved it and that's what mattered most to me.

354
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,020
It was amazing, but all good things.

355
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,780
Come to an end.

356
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,840
Welcome back to reality.

357
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm manhandling you by your super grabbable hips.

358
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,140
Yeah.

359
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,800
I'd love for my biggest worry to be the heat.

360
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,540
Anyway, I stopped by because I've got some news.

361
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,700
Is it a raise?

362
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,160
Oh, no.

363
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,780
Come on.

364
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,780
Haven't you just gotten back from vacation?

365
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,520
This is reality.

366
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,600
No raises and there won't be any.

367
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,060
But they started replacing electric poles in the park
yesterday and every now and then the power goes out.

368
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,280
I don't like that.

369
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,800
So some Sometimes the lights flicker, but that's nothing
new, since things here rarely work properly.

370
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,260
Oh, and we're down to walkie-talkies since calls don't go
through.

371
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,880
There's still no signal.

372
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,320
They still haven't fixed it?

373
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,660
Jeez, it's been, what, at least three weeks since we
reported it?

374
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,660
So if the power goes out, just wait a bit, and everything
should come back to normal.

375
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,120
Oh, what was that?

376
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,260
Oh, and for my best buddy, here's a freshly brewed coffee
strainer.

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,270
You guys think John is going to survive the night?

387
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,010
A souvenir for my vacation.

388
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,110
Oh, shit, man.

389
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,490
Now this is...

390
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,210
Wow, an effing gift.

391
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,910
Not some fridge magnet.

392
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,190
Thanks.

393
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,430
out at the next barbecue.

394
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,290
Oh, John is not gonna make it.

395
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,010
John?

396
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:04,090
John is not gonna make it and our newly hired friend is not
gonna make it.

397
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,030
Sounds good, but now if you don't mind, all right, all
right, I'm out.

398
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,410
I can see the pile of reports on your desk.

399
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,730
He said, he hinted at a future event.

400
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,650
There's no way.

401
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,090
There's no way he'll make it.

402
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,170
Catch you later, alligator.

403
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:22,510
Mm-hmm.

404
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,230
Later.

405
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,510
Crocodile.

406
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:24,910
Wait.

407
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,030
Yeah, shut it.

408
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:27,590
Shut the door.

409
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,310
I should start working.

410
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,210
The stack of reports is pretty large.

411
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,770
Wait, I need to finish reading this last part, though.

412
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,770
Digital tools.

413
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,650
As a park employee, your computer is a vital tool for
monitoring and managing daily operations.

414
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,310
Hold the escape key to open the game menu.

415
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,210
Report app.

416
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,530
Weather app.

417
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,130
Park watch app.

418
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,770
Report track app.

419
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,310
Wait, so submit park incident reports.

420
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,730
View real-time park weather.

421
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,450
Interactive map showing sector status.

422
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,490
Verify report accuracy.

423
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,410
What is this?

424
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,930
I guess this is the radio?

425
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,850
Oh my god.

426
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,850
Why do they cover up the whole screen when he does that?

427
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,290
I wonder what the weather's like today.

428
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,470
Rainy.

429
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,650
Until three eight...

430
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,830
Wait, is this like a five nights of Freddy's situation?

431
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,110
Do I have to last until 3 a.m?

432
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,530
A cupa.

433
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,850
What time is it now?

434
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,730
This computer doesn't have a time.

435
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,510
I have no clock.

436
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,510
All right, let's see what we got.

437
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,130
Report the files, review.

438
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,590
Okay, documents.

439
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,550
Trip with John!

440
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,550
Wait, what are these?

441
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,650
Oh, What the...

442
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,470
What is this called?

443
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,250
20 and 24, 1?

444
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,850
20, 24, 2?

445
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,230
20, 24, 3?

446
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,010
Oh, dang, we're the life of the party!

447
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,770
What computer doesn't tell the time?

448
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,570
I know, right?

449
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,910
How am I supposed to know when my shift is over?

450
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,370
Trip with John, let's see.

451
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,820
Ah...

452
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,760
Okay!

453
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:38,880

17th due to park maintenance work all supervisors are

456
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,720
required to inform night shift and patrol employees that
their shifts will end two hours earlier.

457
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,900
Every employee must check out from the park no later.

458
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,060
Ah, so we do end at 3 a.m.

459
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,520
How do I know what time it is?

460
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,300
Anything going on in the park watch?

461
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,740
Okay, everybody's... Oh, sorry.

462
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,720
Everything's alive, I guess.

00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,120
Wait, what the hell is that?

464
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,860
Oh, that's a tree.

465
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,980
Oh, gosh, my head's in the way.

466
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,360

471
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,460
This is fine.

472
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,840
This is fine.

473
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,620
Everything's fine.

474
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,240
Okay.

475
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,330
There we go.

476
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,920
Sorry, I'm adjusting things on my computer and now...

477
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,440
Okay, there we go.

478
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,460
See, I thought this was a thing, but it's a tree.

479
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,780
Okay.

480
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:30,940
Okay.

481
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,280
Let's look at our first report!

482
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,380
Hold right mouse button on report to drag it.

483
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,440
Okay, it said anything before January 10th, right?

484
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,000
Okay.

485
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,400
42G.

486
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,060
Two boats are spotted on Lake C-17 with fishermen on board
casting their lines into no fishing zone.

487
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,260
So what, I report this?

488
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,240
Phoebe!

489
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,340
Thank you so much!

490
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,000
Thank you, thank you!

491
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,680
Hold on, I'm trying to figure out...

492
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,780
I just started this game, I'm trying to figure out what to
do.

493
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,980
If a report is unclear or formatted, you must flag it.

494
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,220
It said only two boats, but I saw three.

495
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,580
Thank you for all the gifted, you guys!

496
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,640
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

497
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,880
Where did it go to?

498
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,600
Oh, here?

499
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,700
Oh, okay, okay, wait.

500
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
It says two.

501
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,280
Oh, there are...

502
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,380
I was thinking of two people.

503
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,300
There are two boats.

504
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,640
One boat, two boat.

505
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,040
But this boat has two people.

506
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,700
So this is fine, then.

507
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,980
It's not outdated at all.

508
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,760
So I just leave it, I guess.

509
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,770
Thank you guys so much for all the gift.

510
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,430
Thank you.

511
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,730
figure out the game and concentrate before I...

512
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,710
Oh, here we go.

513
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,530
Okay, I see.

514
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,030
You report it for...

515
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,350
Oh, okay.

516
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,190
Illegal fishing.

517
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,570
Ah, I see, I see.

518
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,390
Okay, I did not notice this drop down.

519
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,150
Okay.

520
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,730
Illegal fishing.

521
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,290
Submit.

522
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:28,810
Which path?

523
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,230
Oh, this is the human test.

524
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,270
This goes to the cabin.

525
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,050
Oh, I submitted my first report.

526
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,990
I see, I see, I see.

527
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,410
Thank you guys, roll the gift, Sid!

528
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,010
Thank you!

529
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,510
Okay.

530
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,150
Two hunters are spotted in the I-16.

531
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,150
This is wrong.

532
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,470
Because the zone is incorrect.

533
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,090
Carrying a deer between them to make a makeshift stretcher.

534
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,070
So this is wrong.

535
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,170
Image or sector doesn't match description.

536
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

537
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,750
Foggy lake, a boat, two people.

538
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,650
Was the photo taken up?

539
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,050
Chris!

540
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,130
Oh my gosh.

541
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,850
Ace Attorney moment?

542
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,830
Did you guys see that?

543
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:30,610
That they were like, We want to make Mega Man, Ace Attorney,
and Devil May Cry bigger IPs or whatever?

544
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,170
Kind of crazy.

545
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,070
Submit.

546
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:36,950
Catch the poacher.

547
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,510
Which kind of surprised me.

548
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:51,050
I always thought that Mega Man was already like a really
popular IP name, you know?

549
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:51,710
I don't know.

550
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,530
Thank you so much for the gift.

551
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,850
Thank you, Warden.

552
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,570
Thank you.

553
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,250
Mega Man is alive.

554
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,270
I guess...

555
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,490
What?

556
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,990
What was that one game that the creator made that was like
a...

557
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,710
What's the word?

558
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,430
What's the word?

559
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,770
That was, uh...

560
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,250
Kickstarted Mighty Number 9!

561
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,330
I feel like ever since then it was kind of like...

562
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,630
You know?

563
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,130
Oh, creepy!

564
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,630
Oh, creepy!

565
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,910
Oh, whoa!

566
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,250
Oh, whoa!

567
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,270
I wish I could...

568
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,470
I wish there was like...

569
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,430
I feel like this is a little, um...

570
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,010
What's the word?

571
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,170
Difficult of a...

572
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,590
Way to do this.

573
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,510
Just because it's like...

574
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,710
It doesn't feel very streamlined.

575
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,530
I don't know.

576
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,050
It's fine.

577
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,890
All images with deer.

578
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,770
Oh my gosh.

579
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,770
I hate human tests.

580
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,930
What is this?

581
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,390
Review track.

582
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,670
Oh, I got one wrong!

583
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,110
No way!

584
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,710
Wait, my shift ends up...

585
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,030
No, no, my shift ends at 3.

586
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,730
The report tracker updates itself periodically.

587
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,070
Wait, I got it wrong?

588
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,400
There's another one, though.

589
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,720
What am I supposed to do with this?

590
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,520
Let me...

591
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
Let me check the...

592
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,540
Let me check the guidebook.

593
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,090
Uh-oh.

594
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,710
Wait, you must flag it.

595
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:53,770
Oh, here we go.

596
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:54,910
Um...

597
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,150
Damaged.

598
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,810
Oh, destroy it using the...

599
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,110
Oh!

600
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,170
Wait, I already put it in.

601
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,210
Wait, take it out?

602
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:04,830
Wait.

603
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,430
Wait, I messed up.

604
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:09,990
Wait, no!

605
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:10,450
I

606
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,610
didn't realize that once I put it in.

607
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:16,890
Oh, no.

608
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:17,710
What do I do?

609
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,530
It won't let me drag it.

610
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,650
Wait, maybe...

611
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,810
Oh, no.

612
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,350
It won't let me put it in the bin.

Ah!

619
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:07,960
Ah!

620
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,680
Oh, uh...

621
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,220
Oh, gosh.

Into the pile!

623
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,260
Into the bin.

624
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,060
Into the bin with a yee.

625
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,340
Okay, never mind.

626
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,920
Uh, I think I'm just gonna have to take the L, everybody.

627
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,480
Hi!

628
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,740
All the trash into the bin.

629
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,480
I...

630
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,080
Uh, there...

631
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,220
Oh.

632
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,020
Oh.

633
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:31,880
Oh.

634
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,040
That must be the new guy John was talking about.

635
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,220
Yeah?

636
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,100
Are you the new guy?

637
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:43,620
Henry?

638
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,980
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

639
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,540
I'm Henry, the new guy.

640
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:49,720
Hi, Henry.

641
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,380
Nice to meet you.

642
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,860
John mentioned you dropped by for the keys to your cabin.

643
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,440
Oh, I thanks a lot.

644
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,840
You know, it's not every day we see someone new joining the
night shift.

645
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,560
It's great to have you here.

646
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,480
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

647
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,720
Thanks, John actually showed me everything yesterday and
went over the rules.

648
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,420
I also heard this park is a great reputation.

649
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,220
Why is he British?

650
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,840
I don't know.

651
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,000
Ask him!

652
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,020
Why?

653
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,040
He came from England!

654
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,360
Is that so strange?

655
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,540
Is that so weird?

656
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,300
He's British?

657
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,000
Oh, sorry.

658
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,380
I accidentally clicked out of the game.

659
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:38,370
Yes.

660
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,610
Ponstit Awards and Stellar Reviews.

661
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,370
Pretty impressive accomplishments.

662
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:46,270
That's true.

663
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,330
We do our best to live up to that reputation.

664
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:50,250
That's good to you.

665
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,350
What's he doing?

666
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:53,870
He's so shy.

667
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,610
Have you worked in a park before?

668
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,830
Is this your first time?

669
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,830
Oh, I blimey, I've never even been to the United States of
America.

670
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:08,690
I've never worked in a park, let alone on a night shift.

671
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,310
I took this job because it pays well, and I just finished
moving.

672
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,370
See, he moves!

673
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,580
They're from England.

674
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,350
He would call it the colonies.

675
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,610
Oh, my bad.

676
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,010
Flink Peek.

677
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,750
Oh, really?

678
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,430
I haven't heard about them paying a lot.

679
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,670
What brings you to such a remote place?

680
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,350
Flink Peek is a small town.

681
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,570
Honestly, I'm not even show myself.

682
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,290
My wife and I moved here because we wanted a break.

683
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,290
Ten years in the corporate world really wore me down.

684
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,850
Life here seems so peaceful.

685
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:57,770
No rush.

686
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,330
Just better.

687
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:04,010
And honestly, if I'd stayed there, my health would have
taken a serious toll.

688
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:05,750
I get that.

689
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,670
Anyway, I should stop chatting and get to my cabin.

690
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,230
Get my cabin set up before it gets too late.

691
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,630
Henry, good luck with the job.

692
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,230
I hope you'll be a Great partner.

693
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:21,170
Flink, pink, flink, flink, flink, flink, flink, I can't say
this name.

694
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,670
I don't know why, but I love the feel of pixel art horror
games.

695
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:27,370
Me too!

696
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:40,500
Flink, flink, flink, flink, flink, flink might be out in the
middle of nowhere, but like you said, there's no rush here,

697
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,660
and the nature around us is the best part.

698
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:45,980
Exactly.

699
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,140
Thanks for the chat.

700
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,800
Once I've got some free time, I'll definitely drop by Dan
for a cup of...

701
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,580
See you around!

702
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,020
See you, Henry, and remember to enjoy the nature around you.

703
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,580
Stop being such a weirdo.

704
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,000
Forcing a British accent.

705
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,140
Flink Pink is my favorite K-pop group.

706
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,340
Oh, I said something about corporate life.

707
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,220
I missed it.

708
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:14,860
Oh well.

709
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,140
Uh, okay.

710
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,400
This guy, bad, shredder.

711
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,140
Yeah!

712
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,280
A hunter is captured on camera in the Q27 Forest Zone,
standing over a freshly killed deer.

713
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,540
The hunter is holding a rifle and appears to be inspecting
the deer.

714
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,120
January 4th!

715
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,860
Okay, so this is an old guy.

716
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,160
This is an old report.

717
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,800
Report outdated.

718
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,700
To the cabin.

719
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,640
Flink.

720
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,040
Flink.

721
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,100
Wait, didn't I get it right?

722
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,540
Oh yeah, I got one wrong.

723
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,040
My accuracy?

724
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:00,860
No.

725
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,540
No.

726
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:10,480
No.

727
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,220
No.

728
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,700
Come on, I need the power to get anything done.

729
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:26,860
Come on.

730
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,440
I'm scared.

731
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,900
Someone's calling.

732
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,660
I should pick up.

733
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,600
Oh, hell.

734
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,980
This is Caroline.

735
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,740
Do you copy?

736
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,340
Over.

737
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,460
I copy you, Caroline.

738
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,880
Hey, I'm calling because...

739
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,140
I'm calling to say goodbye!

740
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,160
Caroline, I just met you just now!

741
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,860
I'm sorry.

742
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,800
I didn't even have time to stop by and talk.

743
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,380
Goodbyes like this suck, and I feel bad for ending things
this way.

744
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,920
I just had.

745
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,620
Caroline, I understand.

746
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,420
You don't need to explain yourself.

747
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,480
Wait, what's going on?

748
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,540
Hey, I don't think this is the end.

749
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,640
You can still reach out or drop by anytime.

750
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,600
I didn't mean it's the end.

751
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,260
It's just...

752
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,560
So you got the job?

753
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,760
Yes, I did.

754
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,020
That's great.

755
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,680
That's excellent.

756
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,020
You should go into this...

757
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,080
You should go into this science.

758
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,480
Oh my god, she's going into science.

759
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,840
I don't think this is my wife.

760
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,580
How's this called?

761
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,880
Park Science Laboratory Researcher.

762
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,680
Thank you for the Superchild!

763
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,520
Yes, that's a good opportunity for you and your future.

764
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,100
She's a scientist.

765
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,160
Women in STEM!

766
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,300
Women in STEM!

767
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,300
I know, and I'm a little scared.

768
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,840
But it will be fine, right?

769
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,780
Oh my god, Caroline's not gonna make it either.

770
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,520
Caroline just got a new job.

771
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,320
Henry just got a new job.

772
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,060
Uh, John is looking forward to the barbecue.

773
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,780
Nobody's making it out alive.

774
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,900
Of course it will be fine.

775
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,660
I'm telling you.

776
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,980
I just wanted to tell you that it was a pleasure working
with you.

777
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,620
I could always count on you.

778
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,980
And this park has one of the best employees in you.

779
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:11,480
Aw.

780
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,240
Okay, okay, enough.

781
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,040
Hey, I have a request.

782
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,220
Yes?

783
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,240
In your free time, make me a robot that can do my job for
me.

784
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,940
No, wait, too real.

785
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,860
It's called Chat GPT.

786
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,040
Haha,

787
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,260
as soon as I start making robots, I'll bring one to you.

788
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,860
Great, I've got to get back to work.

789
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,680
Take care out there, Caroline, and good luck.

790
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:44,860
Thanks.

791
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,680
For all these years of working together, I promise I'll
visit your park more often.

792
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,780
But for now, over and out!

793
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,240
Over and out!

794
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,620
I'm sure she'll do great at the new job.

795
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,920
Oh, so there's like a little counter, okay.

796
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,560
Oh, I could just call anybody!

797
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,060
Douglas?

798
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,700
Who was...

799
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:06,980
Wait.

800
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,900
John!

801
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,140
John!

802
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,540
Hey, hey, how's it going?

803
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,080
It is for horror movie game reasons that I make sure nothing
positive is happening in my life when we're heading to work.

804
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,560
Eh, alright.

805
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,060
Same as always.

806
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:24,680
Boring.

807
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,680
Still got a bit more trail to cover.

808
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,220
Gotta say it felt better during a better being on vacation.

809
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:37,660
Yeah, of course it would Oh, come on Were there always this
many reports to process?

810
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,400
Be glad you're not walking around in the rain.

811
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,320
Oh, and I meant to call you.

812
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,300

00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,490
Now that's what I like to hear.

822
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,570
Alright, I'm wrapping up.

Let's get back to work now.

827
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,170
A lone fisherman is spotted.

828
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,910
A boat, Lake C-17, January 12th.

829
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,690
Illegally fishing in a protected zone.

830

Okay, seems good to me.

831
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,090

Alright, let's check our review track.

00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:20,880
We're doing well.

860
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,540
Ah!

861
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,980
Look at that!

862
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,960
78% accuracy.

863
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,260
Let's go.

864
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,700
Oh, my god.

865
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,580
Oh, I thought it was in a hole.

866
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,740
So he's dead?

867
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:36,300
No!

868
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,140
The sectors are wrong.

869
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,580
I already see it.

870
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,370
Yes, this.

871
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,290
I'm human.

872
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,550
Why does he look so upset by that?

873
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:56,570
What's that sound?

874
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,390
Oh, okay.

875
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,830
I don't recognize the sound of the computer anymore.

876
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:03,530
Okay.

877
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:04,930
Okay.

878
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,270
The kids be partying.

879
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:13,490
Three people are sitting on top of an electrical shed inside
a fenced-off area near 822.

880
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,370
Okay.

881
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,310
I wonder how many I have to get through.

882
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,930
Let's see.

883
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,130
Restricted area entry.

884
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,750
Plant a tree.

885
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:31,130
What?

886
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,290
Well, these tests are getting insane.

887
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:40,970
Oh, someone's calling?

888
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:42,650
Hello?

889
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,130
Can you hear me?

890
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:45,530
Hello?

891
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,630
Oh, sorry.

892
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:48,690
I thought the power just went out outside.

893
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,010
It's just the text bar.

894
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,190
I was like, wait a second.

895
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,730
Where'd the sudden go?

896
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:06,730
It does sound like the sticky key sound, doesn't it?

897
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:08,210
Hey, I hear you, over.

898
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,130
Great, the signal's getting stronger.

899
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,630
You have access to the computer?

900
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,430
I need to check the sector status.

901
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,110
Yeah, I'm online.

902
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:17,470
The tower should be fully operational now.

903
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,850
Everything looks good on my end.

904
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:22,090
Can you check Park Watch and confirm the status of sector
A22?

905
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,550
Checking now.

906
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:24,690
Standing by.

907
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:25,070
Over.

908
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,250
All right, A22, baby.

909
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,250
Aha!

910
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,290
He did it!

911
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,610
The status is all good.

912
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:33,670
All right, let's go.

913
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,980
Hello, you there?

914
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:40,400
Over.

915
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,500
Yeah, I checked.

916
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,380
Everything's green.

917
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,420
Status is safe.

918
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,760
We're gonna, like, hear him fall to his death or something.

919
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,440
Or get... He's gonna be like, What is happening?

920
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,360
Don't come any closer.

921
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,820
And then...

922
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,320
Status.

923
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,600
I mean, not, sorry.

924
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,140
Static.

925
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:56,100
Silence.

926
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,880
I combine static and silence.

927
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,520
And I have

928
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:16,100
to go.

929
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:16,600
Good night, Minto.

930
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,420
Good night, Brandon.

931
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,820
Oh my gosh, status.

932
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,560
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

933
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,040
Nice work.

934
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:26,760
Thanks.

935
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,120
It took some effort, but it's all good.

936
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,860
Now time to head down.

937
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,100
Oh my god, here it comes.

938
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,320
Sounds good.

939
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,500
Appreciate you checking the status.

940
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,340
Status.

941
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,960
Yeah, we're blaming the jet lag.

942
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,200
We're blaming the jet lag.

943
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:45,920
Gotta run.

944
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:46,980
It's crazy windy up here.

945
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:47,700
Over and out.

946
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,200
over and out.

947
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,180
Nah, he's fine.

948
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,400
Person is captured on camera illegally cutting down a tree.

949
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,620
He just wants to be Johnny Appleseed.

950
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,800
Several stumps from previously cut trees are visible.

951
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,940
Oh my gosh, he's in menace.

952
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,380
January 12th.

953
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,200
C17, okay.

954
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,540
This is all good.

955
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,140
Gorsh.

956
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,480
He did...

957
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,140
Uh...

958
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,720
Wait, uh...

959
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,580
Environmental destruction!

960
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,740
To the cabin?

961
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,400
This one.

962
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,660
Serial lumberjack.

963
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,620
What if he's just trying to build a log cabin?

964
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:41,900
Woohoo!

965
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,080
Our accuracy is going up, up, up.

966
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,100
We're going up, up, up!

967
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,560
I'm gonna take a sip of coffee.

968
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,100
I'm scared.

969
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,360
Okay, everything's fine.

970
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,220
For now.

971
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,280
Illegal campfire.

972
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,680
F-50 trail.

973
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,240
F-50.

974
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,180
January 5th.

975
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,160
This one's outdated.

976
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,440
It was the 10th, right?

977
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,480
January 10th.

978
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:07,480
Right?

979
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,260
You mean Paul Bunyan.

980
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,800
Appleseed planted trees.

981
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,900
Well, what if Johnny Appleseed wanted to become evil?

982
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,660
What's that sound?

983
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,830
You guys hear that?

984
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,720
The evil lore, Axe.

985
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,940
Yeah, not even the one slur.

986
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,640
The evil lore.

987
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,020
You guys hear that?

988
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,200
Do I open the door?

989
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,140
Uh, let's have some liquid courage.

990
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:09,990
Can you check the window?

991
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:10,530
No.

992
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,630
Oh wait, I can't even do anything.

993
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:19,590
I'm scared Oh

994
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,150
Who the hell was that?

995
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,990
Definitely not one of the rangers What was he doing down
there?

996
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:42,520
Um, I should call and tell somebody John John I should try
again later Uh-oh, John is dead

997
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,460
Uh, Doug Who the heck is Doug?

998
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:49,880
Douglas.

999
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:53,460
Douglas?

1000
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:55,820
No response.

1001
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,600
Did he have a hook hand?

1002
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:58,960
I didn't- Hook hand?

1003
01:03:59,120 --> 01:03:59,660
I didn't see.

1004
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:01,780
Henry?

1005
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,440
Do you cop- Henry, do you copy?

1006
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,200
I hear you loud and clear, over.

1007
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,700
I just had a weird situation.

1008
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:12,800
What happened?

1009
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,040
Someone was in front of my door, but the moment I opened it,
they ran away.

1010
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,780
I assume it wasn't one of the park rangers?

1011
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,500
I think not, and that's the worst part.

1012
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,880
Who could it have been?

1013
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,020
Just a little door scratching.

1014
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:25,860
Yeah, obviously.

1015
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,260
Hand hook car door?

1016
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,880
Man hook hand car door?

1017
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,080
Who was foe?

1018
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,280
I just wanted to inform you.

1019
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,540
If you see anyone suspicious hanging around.

1020
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,500
Hooking around?

1021
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,880
Let me know.

1022
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:40,840
Sure.

1023
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:41,900
Over and out.

1024
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:42,680
Over and out.

1025
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:44,860
What about Caroline?

1026
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,680
Did she leave already?

1027
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:49,880
Okay.

1028
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,500
Okay.

1029
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,840
Let's see what we got here.

1030
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,480
Area 16 is a...

1031
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,240
Oh, the sectors don't match.

1032
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,220
What are they doing, though?

1033
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,980
Oh, they're doing drone activity.

1034
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,660
Oh, image with deer.

1035
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,080
This one's hard.

1036
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,940
Knocking isn't that guy from a moment ago?

1037
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,280
No, don't answer!

1038
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,360
Don't answer!

1039
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:26,790
Henry?

1040
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:28,110
Oh, it's John.

1041
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,510
Can you explain something to me?

1042
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:35,390
Why the heck is there a bear trap in front of your cabin
door?

1043
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,830
Oh, my gosh!

1044
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:42,590
What?

1045
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,510
Are you kidding me?

1046
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,910
Do you even realize what that thing could do to someone?

1047
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:50,470
John!

1048
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:51,390
What?

1049
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:56,030
John, I just saw some guy outside a moment ago, but when I
opened the door, he ran off.

1050
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,350
It must have been him.

1051
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:07,230
he said the trap are you serious yeah but why and who the
hell is this guy it's a shy of surprise

1052
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:18,650
this guy'll be some messed up psycho no normal person would
set a bear trap in front of a park ranger's cabin we need to

1053
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:27,630
report this someone could have gotten seriously hurt and
that guy is probably still probably still in the park I'll

1054
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:31,130
notify the other rangers to stay sharp, and I'll report it
to management.

1055
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:32,830
We'll catch this asshole.

1056
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,050
But admit it.

1057
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:38,110
We've never seen anything like this before.

1058
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:39,910
Yeah, I totally agree.

1059
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,630
This is messed up!

1060
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:47,250
I never imagined someone would set a barrier trap in front
of my cabin.

1061
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,810
Tell the other rangers to watch out.

1062
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:53,530
I'll handle it.

1063
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,250
Leaving the trap with you, though.

1064
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,430
I'm not dragging that metal junk around.

1065
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,630
Besides, it's your gift, isn't it?

1066
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,450
John, alright, I'm out.

1067
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:07,250
If anything comes up, use the walkie-talkie, I'll be on
alert.

1068
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,570
Got it.

1069
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,790
I don't think you should leave me alone.

1070
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,590
I don't think you should be going outside alone.

1071
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:18,410
Where's the bear trap?

1072
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,290
Can I set it up in front of my door?

1073
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:23,910
Uh, okay.

1074
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:29,930
the guy who set the bear trap saw an extremely large bear
outside.

1075
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:36,030
If you were in Blue Archive, which school would you be in
and which would be your combat class?

1076
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:38,410
Thanks for bringing so many smiles, Minto.

1077
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:40,650
Thank you!

1078
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,490
I would be in Trinity so that I could be next to Koharu.

1079
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,630
Yeah.

1080
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,560
So you're basically Hanako.

1081
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:00,620
Yeah.

1082
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,060
But not really.

1083
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,480
Okay, let's keep doing reports.

1084
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,100
G19.

1085
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,320
Oh, the thing is wrong.

1086
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,160
Sector is wrong.

1087
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,380
This is like papers, please, almost.

1088
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,540
I am human.

1089
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,400
How's my report?

1090
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,160
Oh my gosh, I'm such a good employee.

1091
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,340
Did it say, wait, what did it say?

1092
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,620
Aim for efficiency?

1093
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,300
Aim for a perfect score.

1094
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:36,700
Oops.

1095
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,700
Well that's not happening.

1096
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,260
Um...

1097
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,780
B75, oh my gosh, who's reporting these?

1098
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,220
Getting all the sectors wrong.

1099
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:52,230
Right?

1100
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,250
B75, Q27.

1101
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:54,890
Yeah.

1102
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,450
Who's getting all these wrong?

1103
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:04,970
Oh, someone's calling me.

1104
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:05,590
Hello?

1105
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:08,230
John!

1106
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:10,810
Can you hear me?

1107
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:11,670
Loud and clear.

1108
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:15,330
Listen, I came across a group of people during my patrol.

1109
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:19,450
The park is closed for the night and they were in the staff
only area.

1110
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,770
What, they didn't see like the fenced off area or the signs?

1111
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,730
They claim they didn't.

1112
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,710
Not the sticky keys.

1113
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:31,390
Just some kids, yeah, troublemakers.

1114
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,690
We were just as curious back in the day.

1115
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:35,290
Can't argue with that.

1116
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:36,810
We pulled off worse stunts.

1117
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,050
I'll escort them to the exit.

1118
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:40,690
Make sure they don't...

1119
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:42,330
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

1120
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,150
I can't stop you hiding, you guys.

1121
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:48,810
Make sure they don't mess around anymore and give them a
motivational speech.

1122
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,350
Listen, can you call Douglas?

1123
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,710
I tried reaching him, but he's not answering.

1124
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:56,470
Starting to worry about our forest grandpa.

1125
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,610
Wait, is Douglas the guy that was...

1126
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:01,930
No, if he's a grandpa, he wouldn't be up on the trees.

1127
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:03,850
Yeah, and I'm sleepy.

1128
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,170
We should have finished his shift in an...

1129
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,170
An hour ago, right?

1130
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:10,470
Yeah, and he's still not back.

1131
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:14,810
I don't want to keep staying late just because he wants to
wander around the forest again.

1132
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,290
Uh-oh.

1133
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,710
Uh-oh, Douglas?

1134
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,990
We're going to get spooky messages from Douglas, I think.

1135
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,430
I've got things to do.

1136
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,630
Beer after work isn't going to drink itself.

1137
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:29,730
Yeah, but you know, there's as many years between him and us
as there are trees in this part.

1138
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,510
Oh, damn, okay.

1139
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,610
Let's give one thing straight.

1140
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:39,210
jokes to me because you're not really killing it.

1141
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:39,850
Dang.

1142
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:40,670
Oh, John.

1143
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:41,690
Tough crowd.

1144
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:42,890
Alright.

1145
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:44,630
I get it.

1146
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,870
He loves this place.

1147
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:50,050
He's attached, but he needs to understand that others are
just trying to do their jobs here.

1148
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:53,570
Though on the other hand...

1149
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:56,390
On the other hand, I could understand his passion for this
force.

1150
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:57,230
Damn.

1151
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,710
I wish I could see the woods the way he does.

1152
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,070
I kind of want to blow my nose.

1153
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,450
One second.

1154
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,960
Oh my gosh, I got it.

1155
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,220
Do it on stream.

1156
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:27,920
Ah, it was a lot.

1157
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:38,920
Wait, speaking of Koharu, a long, long time ago, I said, a
couple months ago, I said that I ordered a Koharu desk mat

1158
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:45,260
and guess what arrived while I was gone.

1159
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,220
Finally!

1160
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,340
Yeah!

1161
01:11:51,980 --> 01:12:00,940
The one lost in the mail yeah yeah yeah it finally came home

tracking but um I bought it in August and it came it came

1164
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,880

1165
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:49,430

Yeah, clearly.

1170
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:25,530
Anyway.

1171
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,330
Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know.

1172
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,990
She finally came home.

1173
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:30,190
She finally came home.

1174
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,050
You're making me yawn too.

1175
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,290
Stop saying yawn and I'll stop.

1176
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:36,190
I'm sorry.

1177
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,950
Okay.

1178
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:45,090
He never seems bored with his job while me.

1179
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,890
Yeah, you always look like you're.

1180
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:48,390
Go on.

1181
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:49,430
Finish that thought.

1182
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,350
You sneaky little rat.

1183
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:53,310
Never mind.

1184
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:57,430
Just let him know when he checks in that he needs to head
back.

1185
01:13:58,430 --> 01:13:58,770
Got it.

1186
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,870
Over and out.

1187
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,870
Douglas should have been here a long time ago.

1188
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:05,090
Something's not right.

1189
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:09,410
We're gonna get creepy sounds from Douglas.

1190
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:10,870
Oh, whoops.

1191
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,350
Oh, shred!

1192
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:21,040
A pile of discarded tires is visible.

1193
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,740
The wrong sector again.

1194
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:24,680
Oh my gosh.

1195
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,960
I kind of hope that they include...

1196
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:32,080
Again?

1197
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:32,820
Someone's calling?

1198
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:35,320
Sticky keys?

1199
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,680
I hope they include some more, like, anomaly-type things.

1200
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,260
Park Ranger!

1201
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,140
That's a nice hat.

1202
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,320
I had to zoom in to read it.

1203
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,720
Thanks for zooming in on my noggin!

1204
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,580
What's in Q27?

1205
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,820
It keeps coming up in those.

1206
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,460
Oh, true!

1207
01:14:59,560 --> 01:14:59,920
Hello?

1208
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,260
Can anyone hear me?

1209
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,360
I need help.

1210
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,000
Hello, I can hear you clearly.

1211
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,440
Hey, I was on patrol and the weather is really bad.

1212
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:09,600
I was supposed to be on my trail, Q11, but I'm somewhere
else.

1213
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:10,840
I think I'm lost here.

1214
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,780
Can you give me the GPS coordinates for the nearest rager
station in Sector Q20?

1215
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:16,680
Q27.

1216
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,660
I really enjoyed this game.

1217
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,420
Hope you have fun with it.

1218
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,300
I'm so welcome back.

1219
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:20,920

Q27.

Of course, stay in place.

1222
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,600

Thank you!

1237
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,040
And hi, fructose cord syrup.

1238
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,060
Welcome back, too.

1239
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Hello, can you hear me?

1240
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:54,900
Yes, I can hear you clearly.

1241
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,260
coordinates.

1242
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,000
Go ahead.

1243
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:06,040
I just heard what sounded like a meow behind me.

1244
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,420
Am I going crazy?

1245
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,340
Is the game that immersive?

1246
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,240
Okay, I've entered the coordinates into the GPS.

1247
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:16,860
Thanks.

1248
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:18,420
Looks like I'm not far from the station.

1249
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,400
I'll head there since the weather is only getting worse and
I'll wait it out.

1250
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,060
They click in.

1251
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,080
If anything comes up, call in.

1252
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:29,940
Over and out.

1253
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,320
Is that a dead deer all torn up?

1254
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,260
There's no way a bear could have done this.

1255
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:43,720
A dead deer is seen lying near the edge of the B-75 forest
zone.

1256
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,040
Its body is severely torn and mangled.

1257
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:48,300
The wound suggests that it was attacked by a predator.

1258
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:54,490
B-75.

1259
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,770
What does this...

1260
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,030
January 19th.

1261
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:01,730
What would this report be as?

1262
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:18,330
illegal hunting none of the above maybe maybe none of the
above we don't know if it's illegal hunting I feel

1263
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:36,090
like a bear could have done that illegal bearing the illegal
Wow the wildlife are being illegal Henry hey do you hear me

1264
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:37,850
well I hear you Fine, Henry.

1265
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:38,710
Did something happen?

1266
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:43,390
I just saw a child running down the river at Sector F-50.

1267
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:49,410
Looked about 10 years old at most, and I'm not sure, but I
think they weren't wearing shoes.

1268
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:52,230
Are you sure?

1269
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:53,490
Pretty sure.

1270
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,450
I got startled because they ran right at me.

1271
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:58,570
Creepy!

1272
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,090
Creepy!

1273
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,730
Oh my gosh.

1274
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:06,010
I watched that movie, Weapons on the plane as well.

1275
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:11,750
I've had that as like my visual.

1276
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,750
But as soon as they saw me, they started running away.

1277
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:22,580
Weapons?

1278
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,760
I thought weapons was fine.

1279
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,640
I liked it.

1280
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,100
I thought it was pretty good.

1281
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,180
It was... I liked the mystery.

1282
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,680
It was less scary.

1283
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:33,760
It was pretty fine, though.

1284
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,340
I liked it.

1285
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,640
Did you chase after them?

1286
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,360
Yeah, for a bit until I lost track of where they were
running.

1287
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,880
Oh my gosh, I'm just imagining them running with their arms
out, like in weapons.

1288
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:45,900
Hmm, strange.

1289
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
I've already notified base A5.

1290
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,720
They'll handle it.

1291
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,920
I just hope that kid gets home safely.

1292
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,560
And that they don't wander around the park at night.

1293
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:55,980
It really freaked me out.

1294
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,300
Thanks for calling.

1295
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,220
I'll inform John.

1296
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,820
Sure, over and out.

1297
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:01,800
Over and out.

1298
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,040
Oh, strange, he said he saw a kid at this hour.

1299
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:07,820
And barefoot?

1300
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,480
Ignoring all the creepy stuff, this game is quite cozy.

1301
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,180
Yeah.

1302
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,160
John!

1303
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,780
I should try again later.

1304
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,860
I said that I would inform him, though.

1305
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:28,150
People seen at the edge of the D15 lake throwing bottles.

1306
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:29,350
Oh, that's a bottles.

1307
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,190
January 20th.

1308
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,130
Dang, litterers!

1309
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:37,730
Uh...

1310
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:39,850
It's not fishing.

1311
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,650
What would it be?

1312
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:44,610
Environment?

1313
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:47,810
What about Douglas?

1314
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:51,350
Oh, yeah, we'll call Douglas.

1315
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,310
Douglas!

1316
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:58,630
No response.

1317
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:02,270
I don't think Douglas is okay, you guys.

1318
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,530
Environmental destruction?

1319
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:04,990
Okay, that's what I was thinking, too.

1320
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:07,470
I am human.

1321
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:11,250
Wait, did I...

1322
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,970
Can I get one wrong?

1323
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,450
That was right, right?

1324
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:15,070
Okay, good.

1325
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:16,010
90!

1326
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:29,230
Now who could that be?

1327
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,400
Take a...

1328
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:37,840
Okay.

1329
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:41,660
Douglas!

1330
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,200
Hey there, kid.

1331
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:47,080
Oh my gosh.

1332
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,340
Hello, Douglas.

1333
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,980
I need to stay here for a while.

1334
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,340
Hope that's not a problem.

1335
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:59,720
for you you're always welcome here something happened oh my
gosh we should probably Douglas why we have so many

1336
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:08,380
questions why are you here what are you doing there's a
pretty big bear outside and I'm not about to piss it off I'd

1337
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:16,940
rather wait here until it moves along damn I remember
running into one myself once I was scared out of my mind

1338
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:24,600
especially since it had cubs with it Don't want to mess with
mama bear.

1339
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,140
You know what I'm more afraid of than a bear though?

1340
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,040
I am more afraid of a moose.

1341
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,060
I never wanted to count.

1342
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,000
Meese are like real dinosaurs.

1343
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,320
A child.

1344
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:48,490
They are giant and they are scary.

1345
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:52,670
My dad once had to climb up a tree to escape a moose.

1346
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,570
That was charging at him.

1347
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:58,250
I thought I was seeing a ghost.

1348
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:00,210
Former human.

1349
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,830
Maybe.

1350
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:04,610
What if I wasn't human though?

1351
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,150
What if I'm like former...

1352
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:10,410
Former crab?

1353
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:13,850
You know?

1354
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:15,790
Mucky moose?

1355
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,030
Rocky Road?

1356
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,730
Gosh, I wish I had some ice cream.

1357
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,040
That's the worst case scenario.

1358
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,600
It was probably a mother.

1359
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:38,060
she won't stop at anything oh by the way John's looking for
you you were supposed to finish your patrol a while ago why

1360
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:54,280
haven't you returned yet we all evolve into crabs crab
people crab people walk like crab talk talk like people I

1361
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,760
was heading back But then I ran into that bear.

1362
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:59,200
The lights went out.

1363
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,960
The rain's coming down harder and harder.

1364
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,500
This is it.

1365
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:04,340
This is what?

1366
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,760
Now it feels like home.

1367
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,180
Douglas is reminded of the war.

1368
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,660
I've worked here my whole life.

1369
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,920
This park is my home.

1370
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,560
This place means everything to me.

1371
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:24,100
In this cabin, it's one of the first ones we ever built in
this park.

1372
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,380
Do you think he...

1373
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,580
Had his first love here in this cabin?

1374
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,440
He's like, that cot.

1375
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,960
That's where me and Sally...

1376
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:48,840
Mees are terrifying.

1377
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,600
They are!

1378
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,300
They're not to be messed with.

1379
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,280
I didn't know that.

1380
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,940
It's also the cabin where that... Oh!

1381
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,020
Oh my gosh, I thought he was about to say it.

1382
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,180
Where that unfortunate incident happened.

1383
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:04,720
Wait, is my cabin haunted?

1384
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,960
I want so badly to meet a guy like this IRL.

1385
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,360
Just so spooky and vague for no reason.

1386
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:12,800
What incident?

1387
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:14,760
You don't know the story?

1388
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,300
Wait, he's going to tell me a ghost story?

1389
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,200
I guess I'm not surprised.

1390
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,820
No one talks about it.

1391
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,800
Apparently anyone even remembers.

1392
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:24,940
When was it?

1393
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,500
20?

1394
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,240
25 years ago?

1395
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,260
Thank goodness he didn't say another story.

1396
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,080
set of numbers.

1397
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:32,340
Douglas, I know nothing about this.

1398
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:33,940
Well, I'll tell you that.

1399
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,420
You should know about the fate of your predecessor.

1400
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:43,700
25 years ago, in this cabin, a worker was found dead.

1401
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:45,980
A very good friend of mine.

1402
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,820
Jesus, why have I never heard about this?

1403
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,200
So it was 2000.

1404
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,580
Yeah, it was exactly 2000.

1405
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,720
Can you guys believe that we're almost a six.

1406
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,620
I can't believe it.

1407
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,700
The disturbing part was that everything about that night was
strange, at least for me.

1408
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,860
I remember it clearly.

1409
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:14,220
Walking through the forest, I didn't feel right.

1410
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,180
I heard whispers.

1411
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:21,560
And sometimes between the trees, I saw silhouettes that
looked like people.

1412
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,820
I'm turning to dust.

1413
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:37,120
You and me both, well, my body is like long lot well it's
probably like congealed I wonder advice if my if I still

1414
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:50,220
have bones hmm everything felt off but when I tried to get
closer to those things they turned out to be bushes or tree

1415
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:57,900
trunks oh my gosh the same thing happened to me I got scared
by tree also like they were just illusions if you were a

1416
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,220
crab you never had bones oh my gosh you're so right.

1417
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,540
My ectoskeleton.

1418
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,260
Yes, but the murder wasn't an illusion.

1419
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:10,600
We found him in this cabin, but the worst part was his
condition.

1420
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:20,640
Douglas, he wasn't mutilated and there were no wounds on
him, but he was dead and his body would occasionally ride

1421
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,500
like a snake.

1422
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:49,600
towards the door but it didn't have much strength he was
dead but he moved sometimes whispered I've never seen

1423
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:57,260
anything like it Douglas Douglas shut the hell up right now
what happened next what about the police the detectives the

1424
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:06,340
park authorities back then worse people ran this park the
workers were treated terribly everything was worse then but

1425
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:09,760
the worst part was when the Parks Management found out about
this.

1426
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,760
I witnessed him myself.

1427
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:17,800
When they carried his body out, all these people were there,
so many of them.

1428
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,520
And suddenly everything disappeared.

1429
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:27,900
Every car drove off, and when I came into the cabin,
everything was... everything was cleaned up.

1430
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:30,120
No traces left behind.

1431
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,900
Christ, this is beyond comprehension.

1432
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,820
Why didn't you report it anywhere?

1433
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,040
I did report it, but it didn't do any good.

1434
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,300
On top of that, I also almost lost my job here.

1435
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,320
Oh, no, Douglas.

1436
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,960
They took everything in an instant.

1437
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:50,020
There was no evidence left.

1438
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,920
And what about your friend's family?

1439
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,500
I've never seen them since then.

1440
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,420
I don't know what happened to them, but I'm afraid those
people might have taken them too.

1441
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:00,640
Maybe even.

1442
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:04,980
Douglas, I'm so sorry about your friend, but this is not the
time.

1443
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:06,900
I'm too scared.

1444
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,180
I'm literally...

1445
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,460
I'm shivering in my booties.

1446
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:17,080
Yeah, why did he stay at the park?

1447
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:20,720
Don't worry about it.

1448
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,980
I'm sorry, I'm not going to do the voice anymore because my
voice.

1449
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,620
After all this time, I sometimes wonder if he just died and
I'm making up stories.

1450
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,420
Douglas is talking, but no words are coming out.

1451
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:35,840
I should get going.

1452
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,120
Sorry if I scared you.

1453
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,060
But don't worry.

1454
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,820
Nothing like that has ever happened again.

1455
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:41,700
He was a really good person.

1456
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,960
I did something like this have to happen to him.

1457
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:45,580
I...

1458
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,660
Take care, Douglas.

1459
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,680
And come visit me more often, okay?

1460
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:50,340
Oh, sure.

1461
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,580
I should get going now.

1462
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,500
Thank you for letting me talk to someone about this.

1463
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,520
Oh, wait!

1464
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,760
The weather!

1465
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,560
I've never heard of this.

1466
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:03,820
What the hell else have they been hiding from us?

1467
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,180
Well, I guess...

1468
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:12,580
convenient timing that the uh i need some liquid courage
everybody coffee's gone no

1469
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:23,590
good psa to be careful of wildlife even the bucks of my
neighborhood get full of themselves come mating season oh

1470
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:27,010
sad thing is there was no more apocalypse

1471
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:40,450
days to look forward to survive y2k survived 2012 rapture
was last september i thought they they i'm just i'm just

1472
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:42,130
slurping for the fun of it.

1473
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:45,130
I thought they changed the rapture dates.

1474
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:47,610
What is going on here?

1475
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:49,090
Oh, a group of four people.

1476
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,350
E40, January 13th.

1477
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:54,210
Filming as one person attempts to break a tree.

1478
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:56,170
He's doing a really good job at that.

1479
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,010
Am I crazy?

1480
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:03,990
We'll say environmental destruction.

1481
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,130
Plant a tree.

1482
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:08,730
Plant a tree.

1483
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:10,350
I'm the Laura.

1484
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:14,910
Yeah, it got rescheduled, I think.

1485
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:18,930
A group of visitors.

1486
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:21,950
Swimming in a C-17.

1487
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:22,890
Okay.

1488
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:26,370
What would that be?

1489
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:27,730
Oh, restricted area, right?

1490
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,450
Uh, restricted area.

1491
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:32,890
I am human.

1492
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,230
Let's say, oh, wait, let's talk to John.

1493
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:42,970
Let's say, let's tell him that we found Douglas.

1494
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:44,550
Hello, we found Douglas.

1495
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:44,810
Douglas.

1496
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:46,530
John, do you copy?

1497
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:48,310
I hear you over.

1498
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:51,350
Don't try to take selfies with bison.

1499
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:53,790
Wait, why?

1500
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:55,150
Do they not like it?

1501
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,730
Douglas was here.

1502
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:58,350
He said he's heading back now.

1503
01:31:59,230 --> 01:31:59,990
I am the Lorax.

1504
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:03,950
I speak for the trees, and for some effing reason, the trees
speak between the bees.

1505
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:09,390
Well, I guess they could if they...

1506
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,810
Is there something outside?

1507
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,100
Do you guys see that?

1508
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:21,640
I don't know if it was always like that or not.

1509
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,640
I was getting worried about him.

1510
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,520
You know what?

1511
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,060
He told me a strange story, like someone died here in this
cabin before me.

1512
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:33,220
I know that one, but I wouldn't believe it.

1513
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:33,780
Apparently.

1514
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:34,780
You know it.

1515
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,380
Why have you never...

1516
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,880
Why have I never heard about it from you?

1517
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,760
Douglas made that up.

1518
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,300
The guy was actually found dead.

1519
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,800
Not in your cabin, but outside on the official trail.

1520
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:47,660
It was in the papers back then.

1521
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:52,200
apparently killed himself by jumping from a high place or
something like that.

1522
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:53,920
I don't remember exactly.

1523
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:57,320
It was...

1524
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:01,660
Sorry, it was near the edge of our park, far from our
sector.

1525
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:05,420
Douglas told me something different.

1526
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,440
Can you seriously believe that?

1527
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:08,940
I don't know.

1528
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:14,340
Well, I know I still have a lot of kilometers to cover, so
I'm wrapping this up.

1529
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,300
We'll talk about it over a beer sometime.

1530
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:19,340
trap guy.

1531
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:20,700
Have you seen anything?

1532
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,160
Has he shown up again?

1533
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,060
No, it's been quiet.

1534
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,080
Good.

1535
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:27,020
I'm around if anything happens.

1536
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:27,980
Got it.

1537
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:28,720
Over and out.

1538
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:29,840
Over and out.

1539
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,020
Oh, it is the wiggling of the trees.

1540
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:32,700
Okay.

1541
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,860
I thought it was like, I don't know.

1542
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,180
I don't know what I thought.

1543
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,600
Like, people standing up trying to do the worm.

1544
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,300
That's a dead body!

1545
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,700
I need to alert the other rangers!

1546
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,140
Uncover the report involving a dead person.

1547
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,240
That's the achievement I just got.

1548
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,860
Dead body is seen lying next to a campfire.

1549
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,020
D-15.

1550
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:56,380
Large wound across the abdomen.

1551
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,820
The scene suggests a violent attack.

1552
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:00,220
Um.

1553
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:03,600
What do I...

1554
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:05,560
Uh...

1555
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,240
None of the above, maybe?

1556
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:11,460
Plant a tree.

1557
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:13,820
I am the lorebox.

1558
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,240
And...

1559
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:20,700
Yeah!

1560
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:36,260
let's go uh hello everybody there's um john there's dead

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah who's writing these
reports no response from henry Line?

1563
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,400
Liquid courage?

1564
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:08,360
It is close.

1565
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:09,320
Be aware.

1566
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,400
What is close?

1567
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:21,430
I didn't mean to turn off my light.

1568
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:23,230
There was something in the window.

1569
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:24,810
I need to alert the others.

1570
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:28,330
Oh, what do I do with this report?

1571
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:28,810
Shreddit?

1572
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,050
Oh my gosh.

1573
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:45,250
And we take you!

1574
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:47,010
The bear jammed the cobs.

1575
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,350
If we just keep thinking of it as a bear, it's fine.

1576
01:35:54,190 --> 01:36:00,610
I think I'll submit it as, like, an error because the
description doesn't match anything.

1577
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:03,150
These dang bears.

1578
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:14,430
Let's see if that was a mistake.

1579
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:15,610
No, it says it's okay.

1580
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:18,730
Hello, everybody.

1581
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:19,550
John.

1582
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:27,270
John, if you don't pick up, I'm going to send your toes to
the entire squadron.

1583
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:29,010
Try again later.

1584
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:30,350
What are you talking about?

1585
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:33,450
Douglas!

1586
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,490
I should try again later.

1587
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,770
Why is nobody picking up?

1588
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,630
Okay.

1589
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,340
Oh, not the toes.

1590
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,080
Oh my gosh.

1591
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:48,940
More dead bodies.

1592
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:50,220
What is going on here?

1593
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,660
Who is reporting these?

1594
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,500
Two bodies lie by the lake's edge.

1595
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,180
C-17, surrounded by a pool of blood.

1596
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:02,120
That's no good.

1597
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,920
Things are ramping up crazy.

1598
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:06,600
Wait.

1599
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:11,620
Was the background always weird like this?

1600
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,780
Did I just not notice?

1601
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:19,260
What in the X-Files Twin Peaks is going on?

1602
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:24,100
I don't think so.

1603
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:34,160
What am I supposed to do?

1604
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:36,700
Uh, submit?

1605
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,920
Oh, someone's calling.

1606
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:44,040
Hello!

1607
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,500
Sticky keys!

1608
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,220
Hello, can anyone hear us?

1609
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:52,760
Hello, we need help.

1610
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:53,900
I hear you, Oliver.

1611
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:54,840
Where are you?

1612
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,260
Hello, is anyone there?

1613
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:56,860
Hello?

1614
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,600
I can't hear anyone clearly.

1615
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,060
We have a lot of wounded.

1616
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:00,840
We can't.

1617
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,460
I can't hear you.

1618
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,020
Wait, what do you mean I can't hear you?

1619
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,080
Hey!

1620
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,940
Something's going on in this park.

1621
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,760
What is going on in this park?

1622
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,680
What is going on in this park?

1623
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:24,200
Liquid courage Imagine it like turns into blood or something
That'd be crazy, you know

1624
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:36,720
Oh god Two people impaled on tree branches Surrounded by a
mass of terrifying creatures What do you mean Wait, I don't

1625
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,920
see any terrifying creature Oh gosh, I'm scared

1626
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:49,940
Oh my god, I'm scared Oh my god None of the above.

1627
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,200
It's just scary.

1628
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,380
The ones with the deer.

1629
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:54,600
Deer.

1630
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,880
Maybe call the police.

1631
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,140
For real, though.

1632
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,220
Am I being a good employee?

1633
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:05,840
Yippee!

1634
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,000
93% accuracy!

1635
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,940
Try John again?

1636
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:18,230
I should try again later.

1637
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:20,050
Again, I'm trying again later.

1638
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:26,060
Signal's gone.

1639
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,530
24th January when that report was literally yesterday.

1640
01:39:37,310 --> 01:39:38,470
Wait, that's so scary!

1641
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:42,870
I don't mean to alarm anyone, but I think something's going
on in this park!

1642
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:46,330
Something fishy's happening here.

1643
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:47,450
Try Caroline?

1644
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:49,530
Uh...

1645
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,060
No response.

1646
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:57,560
They?

1647
01:39:57,860 --> 01:39:58,460
Why?

1648
01:39:58,920 --> 01:39:59,980
They who?

1649
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,820
I see pain.

1650
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:02,780
Pain.

1651
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,520
So many hanged bodies.

1652
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,240
Bodies on the ground mutilated.

1653
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:10,920
They're suffering so much, please help them!

1654
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,920
What the hell is that?

1655
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:26,160
No one's in here!

1656
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,880
It's so scary.

1657
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:33,360
I'm afraid to get on my computer.

1658
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:35,260
Weird looking bear.

1659
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,720
I'm taking off my jacket.

1660
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:46,600
I was so cold at the start of the stream, and now I'm
sweating, man.

1661
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:48,840
Uh.

1662
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,800
What if I open the door?

1663
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,020
Oh, he stays.

1664
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:58,420
Okay.

1665
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,360
Let him in.

1666
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,080
Okay, well, I gotta get on the computer.

1667
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,000
Do I still hear him?

1668
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:05,580
Yeah.

1669
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,660
Oh, that's scary.

1670
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:07,320
That's eerie.

1671
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,120
That's eerie.

1672
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,540
Oh my

1673
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:20,060
god It's just still going Oh, shred this

1674
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:36,540
Tall figure watches from the edge of it 22 The subject
doesn't move Something holds Hope perhaps Oh, stop

1675
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:47,540
It's so like Stop right there, scum Oh my god Oh my god
Whoa, what's happening?

1676
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:52,500
I didn't mean that...

1677
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,420
Oh, the background's like totally different now.

1678
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,180
I didn't mean to click on my computer.

1679
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:56,540
E!

1680
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,020
Wait, it changed.

1681
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,360
It changed.

1682
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,800
It killed the guy!

1683
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:06,560
Oh my god.

1684
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:07,680
Oh my god.

1685
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,540
Wait, that's so freaky.

1686
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:13,640
That's so freaky.

1687
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,000
I'm going to try calling everybody again?

1688
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:23,800
Hello?

1689
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,320
No response?

1690
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,700
Where were you, John, when I needed you?

1691
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,460
Signal's gone.

1692
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,280
Signal's gone?

1693
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,380
John, last report?

1694
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:48,060
Is this why it's our last report?

1695
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:51,020
Try again later.

1696
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:57,670
What the heck is happening here?

1697
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:58,750
I'm gonna be above.

1698
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:00,370
Dear.

1699
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:05,270
Oh my god, that's my door.

1700
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:06,090
That's my door.

1701
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:07,090
My door is open.

1702
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:08,310
Everybody, my door is open.

1703
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:09,670
My door, my door is open.

1704
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:13,470
How many buckets of Ectoplasm have you sorted so far?

1705
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:16,850
Am I a good employee?

1706
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:18,170
Yippee!

1707
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,260
Let's just shut that in that guy's face.

1708
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,420
Not today, sir.

1709
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,380
Excuse me.

1710
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:37,550
Not today!

1711
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:39,810
I have work to do.

1712
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:41,650
And coffee to drink.

1713
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:43,950
Is anybody alive out there?

1714
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:47,890
I'm not interested in your services.

1715
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:53,110
He's like, hey, buddy.

1716
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:56,650
I just wanted to tell you you have really secure windows.

1717
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:59,270
But you might want to lock your door.

1718
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:06,110
Nobody is talking to me.

1719
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:13,740
I feel like trying Caroline because she like quit the job is
not, you know...

1720
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:15,030
Oh my gosh, it's normal!

1721
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:16,950
It's just a drone!

1722
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:20,510
Okay.

1723
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:25,630
They're putting me in a false state of security.

1724
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:28,910
Her wallpaper is still messed up though.

1725
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:32,850
Flying drones!

1726
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:33,870
That's what it was, right?

1727
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:35,950
A drone is captured flying, yeah.

1728
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:51,090
rain of spiders that's what it looks like to me rain of
spiders nothing beats a jet to holiday oh someone's calling

keep seeing monsters in the distance I hear other park
rangers screaming, gunshots.

1732
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:14,630
How many park rangers do we have?

1733
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:16,050
Wait, aren't you in a cabin?

1734
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:19,450
No, I couldn't make it to any of the cabins.

1735
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:20,850
They're all too far.

1736
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:22,150
I'm hiding near the rock.

1737
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:23,010
Oh, John.

1738
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:25,470
You're hiding near the rocks?

1739
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:34,280
John.

1740
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:36,500
Oh, John.

1741
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:38,760
I should be safe here.

1742
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,340
Oh, John.

1743
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,120
Oh, John.

1744
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:46,740
John, I just want to say before you die...

1745
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:50,500
You have really nice toes.

1746
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:52,920
You don't need a pedicure.

1747
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:55,820
Listen, I've got an important message.

1748
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,560
There's something wrong with the reports.

1749
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,220
Henry contacted me.

1750
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:00,860
He says that they're changing.

1751
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,380
Yeah, yeah, ours changed too.

1752
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,440
One of his reports mentioned something about a center.

1753
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,480
A heart of the anomaly.

1754
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:11,660
He's still going through the reports, but hasn't found
anything new yet.

1755
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:14,120
You need to submit the reports as soon as you can.

1756
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:14,520
Okay.

1757
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:21,800
There's a chance you might find the center and maybe kill
the anomaly Or at least stop it.

1758
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:35,180
Let's just hope he's John battlefield His name is John dead
guy Imagine he's just like by the way, I never told you my

1759
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:44,960
last name It's dead man walking Static these reports are
terrifying everything around me is weird as hell I don't

1760
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,500
know.

1761
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:51,000
Hey, calm down.

1762
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:51,960
It's going to be okay.

1763
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:53,520
Just start submitting the reports.

1764
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,680
It's our only hope now.

1765
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:55,660
Do you understand?

1766
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:56,660
Yes.

1767
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,580
Whatever happens, it'll be okay.

1768
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:01,060
Right?

1769
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,640
His name is John Wick.

1770
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:05,460
Uh-oh.

1771
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,340
His dog.

1772
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:08,820
Yeah, it's going to be okay, John.

1773
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:09,940
We'll make it through.

1774
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:10,780
Oh, gosh.

1775
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,360
We'll say we.

1776
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:16,160
We need to call for help.

1777
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,720
Right, I should.

1778
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:18,240
Uh-oh.

1779
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,380
Here it comes.

1780
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,060
Oh!

1781
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:22,800
John!

1782
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:23,720
I can't hear!

1783
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:26,320
I can't hear you!

1784
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:27,120
John!

1785
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:29,680
It was so obvious.

1786
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,500
Freak!

1787
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,060
Pick up!

1788
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:38,960
Oh!

1789
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,980
The signal is too weak.

1790
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:44,480
Is that it?

1791
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:45,500
It's the signal?

1792
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,060
Douglas, can you hear me?

1793
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:51,120
No.

1794
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:52,520
Try again later.

1795
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,260
Let me try it.

1796
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,200
Henry, too.

1797
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:58,400
Nothing.

1798
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:01,100
All right, we just gotta do our reports, everybody.

1799
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,840
Vehicle parked, C-17.

1800
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:06,500
Over 72 hours abandoned.

1801
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,140
January 16th, okay.

1802
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,920
John Ordov.

1803
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,360
Illegal parking!

1804
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:26,860

01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:00,880
Oh no no.

1808
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:02,020
Oh my god.

1809
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,700
Oh my god, where'd it go?

1810
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,200
I cut?

1811
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,660
Am I gonna die?

1812
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,280
Hello?

1813
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:19,640
Hello?

1814
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,980
My flashlight!

1815
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:27,980
.

1816
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:28,450
.

1817
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:29,680
.

1818
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:37,470
Guys, I think we're dead.

1819
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,250
Another bastard down.

1820
01:49:45,770 --> 01:49:48,290
Oh, dang it, Douglas!

1821
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:52,060
Plenty more will follow.

1822
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:53,120
Douglas!

1823
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:54,200
Oh my god.

1824
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,260
I'm shaking all over.

1825
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,040
He almost killed me.

1826
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:57,500
You have to be careful.

1827
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,420
Don't make any noise.

1828
01:49:58,820 --> 01:49:59,980
They can hear really well.

1829
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,040
These monsters, what the hell is happening?

1830
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,840
I can see their silhouettes again.

1831
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,420
It's happening all over.

1832
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,820
I have to help Henry.

1833
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,980
Before it's too late!

1834
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:13,040
I saw him, he's trapped inside a cabin, and two monsters are
trying to break in from the roof.

1835
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,860
I still have nine bullets.

1836
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,220
He's got nine bullets left.

1837
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:20,740
I try to go through the reports.

1838
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,000
They're supposed to help somehow.

1839
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:23,880
That's what I heard, too.

1840
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,300
Are you sure you can do this?

1841
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:26,280
You're all alone.

1842
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,080
Nine shots.

1843
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,180
Enough to...

1844
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,480
More than enough.

1845
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,160
I spent 40 years shooting and surviving in the...

1846
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,080
this damn park.

1847
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:43,480
If I ever die, I'll be right fucking here.

1848
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:44,540
Yeah, Douglas.

1849
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:45,080
Yeah!

1850
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:49,900
Can the power come back on then?

1851
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:51,400
I can't do it.

1852
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:51,580
Oh.

1853
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:53,960
Hello?

1854
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:56,320
I hear you loud and clear.

1855
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:58,020
Good.

1856
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,360
Very good.

1857
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,900
Know that you're in some serious trouble.

1858
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:02,740
Why?

1859
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,620
Who the hell are you?

1860
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,840
I've been researching this shit for far too long.

1861
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,600
It took everything I had.

1862
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,880
Unfortunately for me, there's no way back.

1863
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,000
I don't have to, and I won't.

1864
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:15,460
I've got nothing left.

1865
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,360
Nothing left to lose.

1866
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:21,380
What are you talking about?

1867
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,260
Who are you?

1868
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:23,840
Answer my question!

1869
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:25,740
You've already met.

1870
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,680
Not long ago, I'm Doctor.

1871
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:30,240
Sorry.

1872
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:31,260
Oh, he's the guy.

1873
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,660
Sorry for the gift I left by your door.

1874
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:37,380
It was you, you son of a bitch.

1875
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,240
This is...

1876
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,600
Yeah, once again, sorry.

1877
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:42,200
I tried to lure that thing, but it was pointless.

1878
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:44,820
There's something in this park, isn't there?

1879
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,420
Monsters, anomalies?

1880
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,040
What the hell is going on?

1881
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:50,880
Please, tell me!

1882
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:53,220
It's very complicated.

1883
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:57,020
In short, you're all gonna die there, but...

1884
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:58,700
But I'll try to help you.

1885
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:01,360
Call the police!

1886
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:02,660
Where the hell are you?

1887
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:04,420
Doctor!

1888
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:08,500
I'm already far from here.

1889
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,260
Far from that park.

1890
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:13,160
The signal's gonna cut out soon.

1891
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:14,900
Fuck you.

1892
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:18,620
Fuck me!

1893
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:21,480
I just uploaded all my files to your computer!

1894
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:23,920
Files that no one else has!

1895
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:26,680
Files that can bring us closer to solving this mystery!

1896
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:35,620
Why are they so... why are they so mean to each other?

1897
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,580
They can help a lot, but they're incomplete.

1898
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:42,000
The reports can show the rest, but it's too complicated.

1899
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:42,940
Give me one second, guys.

1900
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:44,080
I'm gonna...

1901
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,580
Oh, I only have...

1902
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:46,860
Wait.

1903
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:49,320
I'm gonna pop in a...

1904
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,260
There's a lot of talking.

1905
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,080
I'm gonna give myself a little...

1906
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:53,760
Wait.

1907
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,600
I'm gonna eat some syrup real quick.

1908
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:57,120
Wait, no.

1909
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:57,680
Actually, sorry.

1910
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:58,500
I have throat spray.

1911
01:52:58,660 --> 01:52:59,340
I'll do that in a second.

1912
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:03,830
I should help.

1913
01:53:06,330 --> 01:53:06,730
Mm-mm-mm.

1914
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:10,430
The reports can show the rest, but it's too complicated.

1915
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:17,110
There's a recorded video of case 1998, but it's corrupted.

1916
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:19,150
There's a chance to repair it.

1917
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:22,050
Case 1998, that murder in my cabin?

1918
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:25,050
Yes, there are many weird things happening here.

1919
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:27,190
Hi.

1920
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:30,370
If you make it out alive, you'll find me too.

1921
01:53:30,830 --> 01:53:35,990
Those files, they're the culmination of my whole existence
and everything that was taken from me.

1922
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:37,430
Ha ha ha ha.

1923
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:38,790
Funny, isn't it?

1924
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:42,090
That these files were my whole life, everything around them?

1925
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:43,250
I wish...

1926
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,190
I wish you luck.

1927
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:46,030
Take care and remember.

1928
01:53:47,090 --> 01:53:47,770
Wait, listen!

1929
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:51,910
Remember that shit is fast as fuck!

1930
01:53:53,830 --> 01:53:55,710
They curse so much in this game.

1931
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:56,430
My goodness.

1932
01:53:58,090 --> 01:53:58,430
Hey.

1933
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:01,830
How do I repair the video?

1934
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:03,610
Oh.

1935
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:05,450
This is unreal.

1936
01:54:05,490 --> 01:54:07,030
What's happening here in this park?

1937
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:10,110
I...

1938
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:11,110
I would.

1939
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:13,750
Hello!

1940
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:18,890
I guess John is in dire states right now.

1941
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:20,610
I should try again later.

1942
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:21,890
Douglas is going ahead.

1943
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:22,730
Let's check on Henry.

1944
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:29,470
They tend to curse a lot in the trades, do they?

1945
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:31,890
Some liquid courage.

1946
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:35,210
What's my track looking like?

1947
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:37,410
Wait.

1948
01:54:38,310 --> 01:54:38,890
Three?

1949
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:40,430
it went wrong?

1950
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:41,590
Oh!

1951
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:43,250
Case 1998.

1952
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:44,750
Oh.

1953
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:49,470
Why'd they make it so spooky looking?

1954
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:51,650
Newspaper news.

1955
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:55,450
Yeah, that's what the newspaper tends to report.

1956
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:56,010
News.

1957
01:54:56,830 --> 01:54:57,510
Today's news.

1958
01:54:57,730 --> 01:54:58,750
A suicide has occurred.

1959
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:00,250
That's a lie.

1960
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:05,010
The house was wrong, I guess.

1961
01:55:05,890 --> 01:55:07,870
I only got to drag it to my computer.

1962
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:09,050
I didn't even get to sort it.

1963
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:16,810
night within the grounds of the among green trees national
park one of the night night shift employees took their own

1964
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:21,950
life during duty according to police reports more details
are expected to be released soon parks management has yet to

1965
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:27,990
comment on the incident we extended our condolences to the
family and loved ones this

1966
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:39,110
game is so in serious I it's the entity

1967
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:44,230
What is this one?

1968
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,090
20, 34, 16.

1969
01:55:47,890 --> 01:55:48,590
Drones?

1970
01:55:49,290 --> 01:55:50,010
What is that?

1971
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:54,310
Ah, ayayayayayay.

1972
01:55:54,370 --> 01:55:55,050
Ayayayyay.

1973
01:55:55,130 --> 01:55:55,650
That PNG.

1974
01:55:58,090 --> 01:55:59,630
What are these?

1975
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:01,750
Notes.

1976
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:03,150
Emily photo.

1977
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:05,670
Oh, is she the little kid?

1978
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:07,110
Emily description.

1979
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:09,790
Emily was last seen on January 2nd.

1980
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:16,870
It's worth noting that during the events of the of 1998, a
young girl named Emily was also reportedly seen.

1981
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:20,330
I suspect she is not human, but rather one of the creatures
or a manifestation.

1982
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:23,490
Be careful, she appears with a knife in some of the photos.

1983
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:26,370
A drawing likely made by Emily was found in the cabin.

1984
01:56:30,170 --> 01:56:30,690
Pikachu!

1985
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:34,210
Okay.

1986
01:56:34,850 --> 01:56:37,430
Little stick man on top of some bodies.

1987
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:40,250
Page one.

1988
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:43,130
The tree?

1989
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:45,990
There's a... There's a safe under... Oh, there's treasure!

1990
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:52,310
Apparently this game has multiple endings.

1991
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:55,070
Then I saw it, the creature featured in the...

1992
01:56:55,070 --> 01:56:56,420
Creat- Feet- Feet-

1993
01:57:00,730 --> 01:57:01,970
Mm-hmm.

1994
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:03,870
Do you know?

1995
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:18,250
Oh, why do you do this to me?

1996
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:19,830
when I'm jet-locked.

1997
01:57:23,890 --> 01:57:25,110
Hold on, let me try.

1998
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:26,710
I mean, revenge, revenge, revenge.

1999
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:31,090
The creature featured in the feature featuring the creature.

2000
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:33,850
Yeah.

2001
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:39,910
Just like the reports create anomalies and allow us to see
things, the computer files also seem to reveal a lot.

2002
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:41,350
There are many hidden files.

2003
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:42,430
Reading them isn't easy.

2004
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:45,970
Some can be decrypted, which could bring me closer to
solving this mystery.

2005
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:48,090
But so far, I haven't been able to crack a single one.

2006
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:51,050
Sometimes what's most hidden is right in front of you.

2007
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:53,310
I have no idea how that's supposed to help.

2008
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:55,910
This is...

2009
01:57:57,950 --> 01:57:58,430
Sorry.

2010
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:00,150
This is breaking me down physically.

2011
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:02,850
Solving one piece!

2012
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:05,070
Only opens the door to three more.

2013
01:58:05,510 --> 01:58:09,590
The reports can even lead you astray from the right path.

2014
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:11,630
Everything is so damn messed up!

2015
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:12,830
Nicely done, thank you!

2016
01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:16,850
And then I should access a file that clearly pointed to a
key.

2017
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:19,850
C underscore 0 4.

2018
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:20,930
Unfortunately, it's corrupted.

2019
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:22,310
It can be decrypted, but how?

2020
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:23,770
Oh my gosh, I'm hacking.

2021
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:24,470
Hacksores?

2022
01:58:26,410 --> 01:58:27,890
What did, that was page, no.

2023
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:29,650
That was weird notes file.

2024
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:32,130
Then weird notes file 3.

2025
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:33,350
I can't take this anymore.

2026
01:58:33,490 --> 01:58:34,070
Someone help me.

2027
01:58:34,210 --> 01:58:34,510
Help me.

2028
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:34,790
Help.

2029
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:36,170
I don't want to see any more of this.

2030
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:37,190
That was terrifying.

2031
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:38,510
Everything is starting to make sense.

2032
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:39,290
I can't keep writing.

2033
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:40,950
He's alive!

2034
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:47,650
Uh, those were notes, right?

2035
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:52,250
and then okay this is encrypted does that mean i have 49
chances left

2036
01:58:56,150 --> 01:58:58,870
no newspaper oh yeah we saw that one

2037
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:08,930
there's also our own documents like this visitor stats

2038
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:19,480
oh yeah i didn't finish reading these january 11th the
parking administration reminds all employees about the

2039
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:22,820
upcoming meeting regarding the new guidelines for leading
tourist groups.

2040
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,560
All employees are required to intend on January 14th at the
main building.

2041
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,520
Become familiar familiar.

2042
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:33,820
The park administration announces a scheduled computer
update on January 28th.

2043
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:38,580
All supervisors are required to complete the update by
February 10th.

2044
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:44,540
The park administration announces the beginning of
registration for the trip to Colen Town!

2045
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:49,540
8.008.

2046
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:50,080
It has to be.

2047
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:50,540
It has to be.

2048
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:51,000
It has to be.

2049
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,780
Where the park will be represented at this year's fair.

2050
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:58,400
The entire trip is sponsored and fully funded by the park
administration.

2051
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:01,620
Participating employees will receive a one-time salary
bonus.

2052
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:02,600
Cool.

2053
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:03,900
Hope to see you there.

2054
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:09,530
Is that...

2055
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:10,190
Negative...

2056
02:00:10,190 --> 02:00:10,710
I'm sorry.

2057
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:11,010
Wait.

2058
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:14,310
It's negative 31 degrees Celsius?

2059
02:00:16,890 --> 02:00:17,410
Wait.

2060
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:21,570
Also, if it were that cold, it would not be raining.

2061
02:00:21,970 --> 02:00:22,310
Right.

2062
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:23,330
Am I crazy?

2063
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:24,690
Right.

2064
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:31,270
Even like one degree Celsius, I think it would be snowing.

2065
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,030
T-shirt weather.

2066
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:35,250
Going with the tea.

2067
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:42,830
Oh, the last captured images are gone.

2068
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:45,610
Oh, wait!

2069
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:46,850
Everything is inactive!

2070
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:48,150
Oh my gosh.

2071
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:49,030
Uh-oh.

2072
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:49,990
Not good.

2073
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:51,090
Not good.

2074
02:00:54,210 --> 02:00:54,850
Uh...

2075
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:08,920
I don't know...

2076
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:15,360
Uh...

2077
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,160
It's right in front of you.

2078
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:26,950
Negative 31C, your frostbite is under 5?

2079
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:28,350
You frostbite it under 5?

2080
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:29,290
It is, that's crazy.

2081
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:32,250
Mido-chan, gambare, o-tukare-sama-de-sta!

2082
02:01:32,570 --> 02:01:32,970
E-lai!

2083
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:33,770
Thank you!

2084
02:01:34,410 --> 02:01:39,090
Mid, mint highlights my day.

2085
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,510
A message from K.

2086
02:01:41,050 --> 02:01:41,510
Hi, K!

2087
02:01:41,890 --> 02:01:42,510
Thank you!

2088
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:47,870
It's probably in the reports, right?

2089
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:49,670
Oh, this corrupted data.

2090
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:50,890
Corrupted data set.

2091
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:17,390
Trying to see if I find any, see any, like, numbers, but I
don't.

2092
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:20,450
Maybe there's something in the trash.

2093
02:02:20,590 --> 02:02:22,970
Could call, but there is not.

2094
02:02:25,810 --> 02:02:30,310
we could try 19 yeah let's try 1998

2095
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:46,520
no let's try that though for this maybe oh whoops 19 98

2096
02:02:49,600 --> 02:03:16,610
ah is there a 49 anywhere else in your files Trip with John
Info folder 49 I think that's everything Hmm

2097
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:29,440
Hmm Hmm

2098
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:39,960
For now I'm just going to do another report A drone spotted
A wrong sector Hmm

2099
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:52,460
We hear gunshots.

2100
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:53,700
Maybe I should call Douglas.

2101
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:04,620
Douglas, did you copy over?

2102
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:05,580
Copy.

2103
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:06,800
I heard gunshots.

2104
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:07,460
Are you all right?

2105
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:09,680
I killed two of the creatures.

2106
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:11,720
But Henry's gone.

2107
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:13,040
He's not in the cabin.

2108
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:15,240
Maybe he managed to escape.

2109
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:16,060
Wait, how do we know Henry's gone?

2110
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:23,440
gone possible possible i've got a few rounds left i'm
heading to the main building there are more guards there

2111
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:31,800
i'll join them and we'll come back for you and the others
all right i'm too far from hq i'll stay put okay i'll be so

2112
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:35,360
Douglas you copy over

2113
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:47,120
not good not good not good not good tourists are seeing
scaling okay This is the wrong sector.

2114
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:48,720
The sectors don't match.

2115
02:04:59,150 --> 02:05:02,110
I'm going to do a couple more before I explore.

2116
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:06,370
Three individuals are seen climbing over a fence in a
restricted area.

2117
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:08,410
The sectors don't match again, though.

2118
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:13,050
Get the information correct.

2119
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:14,730
Or else it's useless to me.

2120
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:25,360
Yay!

2124
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:10,190
What do you think this is?

2125
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:20,280
Stop, stop, stop!

2126
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:24,520
Uh, okay, let's look.

2127
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,820
With a Slenderman!

2128
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:30,280
Interesting.

2129
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:34,280
She is gonna be right behind here, isn't she?

2130
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:38,240
No?

2131
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:41,600
This is a cute drawing, though.

2132
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:43,820
Liquid Courage.

2133
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,280
Okay.

2134
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:49,880
It's cute.

2135
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:51,720
Interesting.

2136
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:53,960
Hmm.

2137
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,020
Try the...

2138
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:01,940
Yeah, let's...

2139
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:02,560
What was the...

2140
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,880
What was the full phone number if anybody took it, wrote it
down?

2141
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,720
I should have written it down, but I did not.

2142
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:08,420
Maybe it's...

2143
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,060
Maybe it's been added.

2144
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:10,300
Whoops.

2145
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:12,880
Notes.

2146
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:14,180
Emily.

2147
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,800
5-5-5.

2148
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:19,220
4-5.

2149
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:20,480
six blank.

2150
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,480
Let's try it.

2151
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:27,260
Ugh.

2152
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:29,280
Five.

2153
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,320
Six.

2154
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:34,460
Another number.

2155
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:35,400
No.

2156
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,140
Five, three, one, one.

2157
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:39,680
Wait, what?

2158
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,620
What's that one?

2159
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:44,520
Please don't spam.

2160
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:45,420
Thank you.

2161
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:47,440
Thank you.

2162
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:03,670
I'm gonna ignore that if it's the actual answer.

2163
02:08:05,090 --> 02:08:07,470
Because we haven't found it ourselves yet.

2164
02:08:09,630 --> 02:08:11,530
We haven't found it organically yet.

2165
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:13,950
So I'm just gonna ignore that.

2166
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:20,270
Fishing in a non-fishing zone.

2167
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:22,530
Not the illegal fishing.

2168
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:28,290
With deer.

2169
02:08:29,970 --> 02:08:30,370
One.

2170
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,260
What kind of report is this?

2171
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:42,380
It broke my shredder.

2172
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:43,560
Wait, that's cool.

2173
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:44,260
It looks like...

2174
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:44,760
Oh my gosh.

2175
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:48,100
It looks like the Pokemon card you'd get when you like...

2176
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:50,960
Whoa, whoa!

2177
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:52,840
When you went and saw the...

2178
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:53,620
Wait, can I throw it outside?

2179
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:54,360
No?

2180
02:08:57,970 --> 02:09:01,410
When you went to like the Pokemon movie, you got the special
card.

2181
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:03,830
Tences.exe strikes again!

2182
02:09:03,950 --> 02:09:05,330
I guess I have to put it on my computer.

2183
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:07,010
Upload virus!

2184
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:09,610
Is that a heart?

2185
02:09:12,390 --> 02:09:13,470
Mr. Thomas.

2186
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,740
January 24th, 1998.

2187
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:19,680
Mr. Thomas.

2188
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:26,120
I assume you have already seen the recordings from Cabin 11
and what transpired there.

2189
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:29,380
I need not personally describe that terror to you.

2190
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:33,480
I simply want to assure you that the matter has been dealt
with.

2191
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:39,140
Nothing of the sort should happen again and everything
should return to normal with a few days yeah the ancient new

2192
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:46,120
card i would also like to clarify that threatening us with
the police in this matter is entirely inappropriate please

2193
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:52,140
be mindful of where and to whom you direct such threats we
have fulfilled our part of the agreement and we are not

2194
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:58,920
afraid of you or any authorities if anyone were to find out
about these events you would be first to be held accountable

2195
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:04,960
the evidence has been removed along with the witnesses as
agreed it was not easy we are awaiting the final transfer.

2196
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:08,040
After which all contact will be severed.

2197
02:10:13,550 --> 02:10:16,630
We sincerely hope we have part ways peacefully, Mr. Thomas.

2198
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:18,270
You have a beautiful park.

2199
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:20,450
It would be a shame to lose it.

2200
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:21,370
With respect.

2201
02:10:22,130 --> 02:10:22,350
Doctor.

2202
02:10:24,110 --> 02:10:25,270
Happy one year of Minky Magic.

2203
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:26,510
Thank you, Ellie.

2204
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:28,950
And Zina, welcome back as well.

2205
02:10:29,210 --> 02:10:29,590
Thank you, Bo.

2206
02:10:29,810 --> 02:10:30,550
Thank you, thank you.

2207
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:45,380
I liked my wallpaper before.

2208
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I liked it.

2209
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:54,220
I like these photos so much.

2210
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,220
It was so funny.

2211
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:01,000
I guess maybe I'd check in here to see.

2212
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:03,840
I don't think there's anything like with the numbers.

2213
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:08,260
This didn't really have anything.

2214
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:12,420
Number of incident visitor stuff.

2215
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,140
I don't think has.

2216
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:18,440
Anything that I can tell

2217
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:28,540
Four people are off the marked trail Near the H34 ridge
within a restricted entry One of them is climbing a tree

2218
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:35,280
Wait, January 4th So it's an old one

2219
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:45,600
Those pictures will 1,000% change at some point, right?

2220
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:47,080
I feel like they must, right?

2221
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:54,040
Two freshly killed bodies lie scattered among the nearby
bushes.

2222
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:56,400
Torn into gruesome pieces.

2223
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:58,740
I see.

2224
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,340
Somebody's birthday?

2225
02:12:07,590 --> 02:12:08,310
Screepy.

2226
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:15,840
Wait, it was outdated?

2227
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,020
No, it's not.

2228
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:19,420
January 11th.

2229
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:23,920
I am human.

2230
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:28,060
Oh, someone's calling me.

2231
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:33,340
Hey, I'm coming, okay?

2232
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,540
I'm on my way to you.

2233
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:36,480
Henry, please tell me you're safe!

2234
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:38,680
Toxic!

2235
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:39,960
Welcome back, thank you!

2236
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:41,720
I'm safe, I have to get to you.

2237
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:42,320
I'm close now.

2238
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:43,820
Wait, what do you mean you have to get to me?

2239
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:46,320
Henry, if you're near a cabin, maybe you should stay there,
okay?

2240
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:48,320
No, I can almost see your cabin.

2241
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:49,560
I'm nearly there.

2242
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:50,620
You're gonna be okay.

2243
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:51,900
Wait, I don't trust Henry.

2244
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:52,120
Henry.

2245
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:54,420
Oh, he could do this.

2246
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:55,380
Are you hurt?

2247
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:56,380
I'm coming.

2248
02:12:57,060 --> 02:12:57,580
Answer me, Henry.

2249
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:59,080
No, I'll be there in a moment.

2250
02:12:59,300 --> 02:12:59,720
Over and out.

2251
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:00,760
Hey, Henry?

2252
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:03,520
He's injured.

2253
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:05,320
Why is he so desperate to get here?

2254
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:06,420
Oh, I don't trust.

2255
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:07,640
I don't trust.

2256
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:08,320
I don't trust.

2257
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:09,660
Douglas?

2258
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:13,080
Help me.

2259
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:15,500
Oh.

2260
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:18,140
Liquid courage.

2261
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:21,780
And I'm doing a good job.

2262
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:22,500
Yeah!

2263
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:24,900
Wait, I got one wrong?

2264
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:27,940
Which one did I get wrong?

2265
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:30,600
Dang it.

2266
02:13:35,990 --> 02:13:37,350
This has nothing written.

2267
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,940
Should we just leave the door open for him?

2268
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:51,500
Uh...

2269
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,080
Uh...

2270
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:55,020
There is no description.

2271
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:56,800
Or sector.

2272
02:13:59,000 --> 02:13:59,760
Sure!

2273
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:00,780
Yeah!

2274
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:08,720
I guess none of the above

2275
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:19,170
Submit that guy to HQ Get him out of here

2276
02:14:23,380 --> 02:14:33,520
My scanner is broken Oh Whoa Do you want to look back

2277
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:37,940
Whoa!

2278
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:43,280
There's a hand.

2279
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:48,180
And, uh...

2280
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:49,240
Maybe we can find the...

2281
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:50,260
Another hand!

2282
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:51,600
He's on the computer!

2283
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:53,580
The skeletons control in the computer!

2284
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,000
That's cool.

2285
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:01,420
Looks like he's wearing a hat, though.

2286
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,920
Like, he was a... What's it called?

2287
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,660
Another guy.

2288
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:09,160
Like another park ranger.

2289
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:14,780
I see the sun and I can't tell what that is.

2290
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:15,460
A pine cone?

2291
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:17,880
This is a cool feature.

2292
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:18,860
I like this a lot.

2293
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:22,580
I don't see any codes or anything, though.

2294
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:23,540
Like no numbers.

2295
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:26,000
Oh.

2296
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:28,420
That's so scary.

2297
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:33,380
Oh my.

2298
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:33,660
Oh.

2299
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:37,460
It's not a real file.

2300
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:39,340
Freaky.

2301
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:43,780
Fire is burning.

2302
02:15:44,540 --> 02:15:45,420
Illegal fire.

2303
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:50,510
Wait.

2304
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:51,650
I didn't check the date.

2305
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:52,470
Okay, we're good.

2306
02:15:53,270 --> 02:15:54,750
And the D15.

2307
02:15:55,130 --> 02:15:55,670
Yeah, okay.

2308
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:57,270
I did check that one, but just making sure.

2309
02:15:57,830 --> 02:15:58,670
Illegal campfire?

2310
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:00,430
It's so funny that we're still doing our job.

2311
02:16:00,830 --> 02:16:02,030
Despite all of this, you know.

2312
02:16:05,250 --> 02:16:06,270
Arrest that fire.

2313
02:16:07,430 --> 02:16:07,970
Absolutely.

2314
02:16:08,890 --> 02:16:10,110
Please, Kiri.

2315
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:13,210
Whoa.

2316
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:14,350
The heart!

2317
02:16:15,090 --> 02:16:16,450
Looks like I'm getting close to the heart.

2318
02:16:16,970 --> 02:16:17,410
Disgusting.

2319
02:16:18,290 --> 02:16:19,030
Disgusting.

2320
02:16:20,110 --> 02:16:20,470
Cool.

2321
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:22,670
Upload that to the servers.

2322
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:26,760
Whoa.

2323
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:30,680
Interesting.

2324
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,900
Let's check our documents real quick.

2325
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:38,160
Oh my god, the children are gone!

2326
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:40,420
Wait, his toes!

2327
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:44,400
Okay, the party is still...

2328
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:45,920
is still bopping.

2329
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:52,730
Is that John?

2330
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:54,970
Wait, is this me and that's John?

2331
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:58,830
Okay, toes are intact.

2332
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:02,890
The toes are intact!

2333
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:07,320
The...

2334
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:08,020
Spooky!

2335
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:09,460
Spooky!

2336
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:11,920
Wait, so I'm bald?

2337
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:14,600
Am I the baldie?

2338
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:16,660
Aw, man.

2339
02:17:26,470 --> 02:17:29,650
Small campfire, E40, January 19th.

2340
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:31,650
Dry brush.

2341
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:34,010
Illegal campfire.

2342
02:17:35,850 --> 02:17:37,590
Illegal, yeah, illegal campfire.

2343
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:42,390
I don't know if I should open it.

2344
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:43,250
What if it's Douglas?

2345
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:45,350
Douglas would not knock.

2346
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:45,950
Douglas would...

2347
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:48,690
Douglas would just come in.

2348
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:53,740
Douglas would just walk in.

2349
02:17:56,460 --> 02:17:57,900
Oh, I have to answer.

2350
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:04,400
Here we go.

2351
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:08,360
No one there.

2352
02:18:10,940 --> 02:18:11,720
Ding dong ditch.

2353
02:18:17,930 --> 02:18:19,370
Ding dong ditch.

2354
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,750
Parked E40.

2355
02:18:24,650 --> 02:18:25,730
Illegal parking.

2356
02:18:31,130 --> 02:18:32,030
I'm human!

2357
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:36,630
Yeah, I wish it was a door dash with more coffee.

2358
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:38,350
That'd be great.

2359
02:18:40,470 --> 02:18:40,830
Okay.

2360
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:42,710
Oh, why is it shaking?

2361
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:43,930
What's shaking?

2362
02:18:44,150 --> 02:18:44,450
Bacon?

2363
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:51,990

Yeah, I'm fine.

2366
02:18:56,930 --> 02:18:57,490

Anyway, lucky for you, I'm the one bringing lunch today.

2372
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:33,970
Just for you, you're getting the extra veggie version.

2373
02:19:34,690 --> 02:19:35,950
Hey, that's just cruel.

2374
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:38,450

2375
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:40,170
I'm going to grab it from the car.

2376
02:19:40,290 --> 02:19:41,010
I'll be right back.

2377
02:19:41,410 --> 02:19:42,230
What do you want to drink?

2378
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:43,430
Let me guess.

2379
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:45,850
Excellent choice.

2380
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:54,240
Vehicle parked.

2381
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:58,200
Just a normal report.

2382
02:19:58,320 --> 02:19:58,740
What do I see?

2383
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:00,000
Oh!

2384
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:02,260
There's something written here.

2385
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:04,040
Nineteen- five three!

2386
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:08,120
I think that guy did spoil it.

2387
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:12,040
Five three.

2388
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:14,700
Uh...

2389
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:20,000
I don't know what to- I can't click on it though.

2390
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,240
Man.

2391
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:27,640
But I can- I cannot click anywhere actually.

2392
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:28,680
Oh, I can click here.

2393
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:29,420
Okay.

2394
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:35,060
I'm feeling worse and worse.

2395
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,990
We're back.

2396
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:43,690
We're back, baby.

2397
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:51,760
Oh, what was this one?

2398
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:52,580
The legal parking?

2399
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:54,740
Yeah.

2400
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,200
I'm planting a tree.

2401
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:00,500
And there it goes.

2402
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:07,140
That means 1998 is one of the codes.

2403
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:10,120
I'm pretty sure I tried using that for something else,
though.

2404
02:21:12,460 --> 02:21:13,900
Like, uh...

2405
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:14,100
See?

2406
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:15,320
Yeah.

2407
02:21:24,940 --> 02:21:26,620
What if it's...

2408
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:29,040
I mean, what if it's 4-9?

2409
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:30,240
Oh, dang it.

2410
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:30,960
Oh my gosh.

2411
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:32,260
I wish there was a...

2412
02:21:32,260 --> 02:21:32,960
No.

2413
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:36,580
Can you check the tree now?

2414
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:40,040
I don't even know where the tree is at.

2415
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:46,680
We don't have a camera for anything.

2416
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:48,920
Oh, oh, wait.

2417
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:50,440
Oh, wait, like the actual tree.

2418
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:51,980
Oh, these pictures.

2419
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:53,440
The tree on your desk.

2420
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:57,160
Oh, no.

2421
02:21:58,420 --> 02:21:59,620
I can't.

2422
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:03,120
Yes?

2423
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:05,020
Some!

2424
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:07,680
I'm just trying to use it.

2425
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:11,910
Hmm.

2426
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:18,980
Yeah, Malik, give me a little drawing.

2427
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:22,120
Uh.

2428
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:24,680
What was this again?

2429
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:26,380
Running Stickman.

2430
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:27,780
Got PNG.

2431
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:32,240
Are these more messed up than before?

2432
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:36,240
The party is still on!

2433
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:43,260
The treasure under the tree, yeah.

2434
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:47,880
Oh, whoops, let me open it.

2435
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:51,780
Hello, anybody there?

2436
02:22:54,860 --> 02:22:55,500
No answer?

2437
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:56,860
No response?

2438
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:58,380

2439
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:00,120

2440
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:02,500

Wow.

Anything hiding in the guide?

02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,220
That's a great question.

2446
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:11,020
Oh?

2447
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:11,780

2448
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:13,020
Douglas, are you there?

right okay oh okay they're like no trash apple catch apple
oh that was close that's my high score gonna be a hundred

2483
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:33,390
this is gonna lead you into a false sense of security wait
so the whole thing that was locked here wasn't even anything

2484
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:37,270
Worthwhile.

2485
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:41,570
The pop is so crisp.

2486
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:45,730
Like if when I do it with a map, my mouth.

2487
02:25:54,110 --> 02:25:54,590
Ah!

2488
02:25:55,170 --> 02:25:55,530
25!

2489
02:25:56,070 --> 02:25:57,110
Oh, I got an achievement.

2490
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:59,310
Score at least 25 points in the computer minigame.

2491
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:01,890
Oh, okay, well.

2492
02:26:03,130 --> 02:26:04,090
Oh, we did that.

2493
02:26:05,490 --> 02:26:08,890
Douglas sacrificed his life for you to play this game.

2494
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:10,050
Okay.

2495
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:15,530
Gamer!

2496
02:26:19,580 --> 02:26:20,420
Thank you, Douglas.

2497
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:23,940
Well, now my curiosity is satiated from that.

2498
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:26,960
But we still need this five, three.

2499
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:30,320
I don't want to follow what that guy said, but.

2500
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:34,740
Heart is almost here.

2501
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:38,620
Let's just keep doing reports for now.

2502
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:45,440
Someone's knocking!

2503
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:51,700
No, I don't want to get, I don't like the knocking.

2504
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:54,000
That's my sector.

2505
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:00,120
Do you think it's Douglas?

2506
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:05,620
I'm sure the answer will show up soon.

2507
02:27:05,780 --> 02:27:06,920
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.

2508
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,460
It's me, Goku.

2509
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:13,200
Alright, here we go.

2510
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:15,800
Because it doesn't let you do anything else until you open.

2511
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:16,700
Liquid Courage.

2512
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:19,020
And...

2513
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:22,720
It's...

2514
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:34,600
Henry You need to accept this deal, please He's coming if
you don't accept this deal He'll kill you There's no other

2515
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:39,360
way I see, I see why you came to me What are you talking
about?

2516
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:42,200
See, I was right, you hear it too, don't you?

2517
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:55,100
All over my desk Henry Let me just scoot here him off there.

2518
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:59,540
A whole cup of Henry.

2519
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:01,220
Is there, like, blood on my book now?

2520
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:02,000
That'd be crazy.

2521
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:09,280
Uh.

2522
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:16,640
He made such a mess.

2523
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:17,380
He did.

2524
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:21,320
Deal or no deal?

2525
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:27,700
Okay.

2526
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:30,740
Corpse can move?

2527
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:32,360
Oh, I don't like that.

2528
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:33,080
Wait a second.

2529
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:35,360
Sector 666!

2530
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:43,510
Call Henry.

2531
02:28:44,550 --> 02:28:44,950
Good idea.

2532
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:50,710
I should try again later.

2533
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:56,670
Corpse can move.

2534
02:28:56,890 --> 02:28:58,570
I don't want to put this in the computer.

2535
02:29:05,460 --> 02:29:05,860
Oh, God.

2536
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:06,460
Oh, God.

2537
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:06,820
Oh, God.

2538
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:07,400
Oh, God.

2539
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:11,460
I don't want to dig a tree.

2540
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:13,800
I don't want to plant a tree.

2541
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:16,320
Oh.

2542
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:22,460
Oh, my God.

2543
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:25,500
No, stop, stop, stop it right now.

2544
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,540
Holy cow.

2545
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:37,050
Well, corpse did not move.

2546
02:29:39,690 --> 02:29:44,930
Oh, sometimes the atmosphere, the game is so goofy
sometimes, and sometimes it's so freaky.

2547
02:29:47,590 --> 02:29:47,930
Henry?

2548
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,640
No response.

2549
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:54,420
I wonder why.

2550
02:29:58,200 --> 02:29:59,200
What did we get?

2551
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:00,560
Something popped up on my...

2552
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:01,720
Oh, it was this, I guess.

2553
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:19,600
this thing yeah I'm human someone's trying to contact me I'm
sorry I clicked this first let's go 92% accuracy hello hey

2554
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:27,740
John I was in the past I spoke with Caroline is this Henry
wait no this is me oh I'm speaking to John wait why am I

2555
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:33,120
calling John sorry I get the yellow text in the white text
confused sometimes.

2556
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:35,720
The reports are getting stranger, but they show I'm getting
close.

2557
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:37,340
There's some kind of heart.

2558
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:37,980
There's hope.

2559
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:39,360
Ah, that's good.

2560
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:39,860
Really good.

2561
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:41,620
Things aren't going so well on my end, though.

2562
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:44,420
What's happening?

2563
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:48,000
Wait, how do we... How are we just so casually talking to
John all of a sudden?

2564
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:50,900
I'm afraid we won't be able to see each other again.

2565
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:53,100
No!

2566
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:54,420
One of the monsters got me.

2567
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:56,160
I can't move because of my wounds.

2568
02:30:58,500 --> 02:30:59,220
Where are you?

2569
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:00,000

2576
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:07,720
Get to you, buddy!

2577
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:11,560
Gosh, that one spooked me.

2578
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:14,820
Wait.

2579
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:16,320
John?

2580
02:32:29,990 --> 02:32:30,530
Oh!

2581
02:32:30,890 --> 02:32:31,430
What's happening?

2582
02:32:31,650 --> 02:32:32,410
Oh, shoot.

2583
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:33,250
Henry's gone.

2584
02:32:35,350 --> 02:32:35,850
Uh-oh.

2585
02:32:38,410 --> 02:32:40,970
Henry, you get your butt back here right now!

2586
02:32:41,250 --> 02:32:43,830
Damn, he cleaned up real good, though.

2587
02:32:45,270 --> 02:32:46,470
even leave anything.

2588
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,880
Now we got a zombie walking around.

2589
02:33:00,310 --> 02:33:01,150
Signal's gone.

2590
02:33:01,390 --> 02:33:02,230
I think John's gone.

2591
02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:04,250
Yeah, the signal is gone from his body.

2592
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:07,490
Dang, Caroline got out just in time.

2593
02:33:09,550 --> 02:33:10,950
She was like, by the way, I got a new job.

2594
02:33:11,570 --> 02:33:11,570
Peace.

2595
02:33:11,830 --> 02:33:11,990
Oh.

2596
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:21,320
This...

2597
02:33:21,320 --> 02:33:23,100
We saw this before.

2598
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:25,080
Um...

2599
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:30,600
on the the thing

2600
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:53,540
look closely there's a there's a ah I see it oh wait that's
so cool that's so cool oh you guys I totally got the code

2601
02:33:53,540 --> 02:34:04,720
all by myself and not from some bozo spoiling it in chat man
I feel like that would have been such a cool reveal.

2602
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:07,920
It was still a cool reveal though.

2603
02:34:13,210 --> 02:34:14,230
1-1!

2604
02:34:15,810 --> 02:34:16,150
Yeah!

2605
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:19,550
Code breaker.

2606
02:34:19,830 --> 02:34:22,530
Successfully bypass encryption and open the secured folder.

2607
02:34:22,830 --> 02:34:24,430
That's the achievement I just got.

2608
02:34:25,530 --> 02:34:26,110
Oh, no.

2609
02:34:26,230 --> 02:34:27,650
Now we're really fanafing it.

2610
02:34:28,290 --> 02:34:28,990
Corrupted data.

2611
02:34:35,010 --> 02:34:35,230
Oh.

2612
02:34:35,810 --> 02:34:36,190
Oh.

2613
02:34:37,450 --> 02:34:38,430
What is this?

2614
02:34:38,690 --> 02:34:39,570
He's taking photos?

2615
02:34:40,350 --> 02:34:42,510
Oh, they're taking photos of the body.

2616
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:50,870
Well, trapped in the void...

2617
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:50,970
What?

2618
02:34:51,330 --> 02:34:51,330
Wait.

2619
02:34:52,550 --> 02:34:53,030
Wait.

2620
02:34:53,430 --> 02:34:56,730
Gathering fragments of what remained, I managed to create
the clock.

2621
02:34:57,270 --> 02:34:59,250
Just like the report plans showed.

2622
02:34:59,890 --> 02:35:03,730
Apparently, it has the power to bring back everything that
was killed in the park.

2623
02:35:04,610 --> 02:35:08,450
I don't know how true that is, but I'm leaving it in
clocklocation.txt.

2624
02:35:08,570 --> 02:35:16,890
in case someone shares the same fate as me if anyone finds
this and wants to use the clock warning it will resurrect

2625
02:35:16,890 --> 02:35:23,470
everything that was killed not just people for the clock to
work one condition must also be fulfilled afterwards the

2626
02:35:23,470 --> 02:35:32,110
last report must be completed this comes at a you've got to
do your paperwork at a price it will unleash upon you

2627
02:35:32,110 --> 02:35:37,250
something unimaginably worse than any kind of death wait so
why would I want to do that

2628
02:35:40,410 --> 02:35:49,910
Log 1998 Recovered and secured from cabin number 11 The body
of the chosen one Conditioned detailed in separate file 22

2629
02:35:49,910 --> 02:35:58,930
reports documenting homicides 11 anomaly Reports Reports are
disappearing Final count may not be accurate Three utility

2630
02:35:58,930 --> 02:36:05,590
knives One park ranger issued firearm Four monster corpses
Seven handwritten notes left by the chosen one Three pens

2631
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:10,010
missing walkie talkie still not found The chosen one.

2632
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:20,710
I hate when the eldritch horror makes me file my paperwork
before it inflicts a weight or is the death on me.

2633
02:36:21,130 --> 02:36:21,550
Right!

2634
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:26,230
It feeds on the paper.

2635
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:29,790
It feeds on the Excel files.

2636
02:36:32,030 --> 02:36:33,430
The walls and desk are scratched.

2637
02:36:33,610 --> 02:36:35,110
The chair is broken in three places.

2638
02:36:35,650 --> 02:36:37,230
I thought that said umpul.

2639
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:42,710
The umputer is smashed.

2640
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:52,100
It looks like it though, no.

2641
02:36:55,780 --> 02:37:01,140
The umputer is smashed with its parts scattered across the
cabin.

2642
02:37:02,460 --> 02:37:04,000
Signs of a struggle are clearly visible.

2643
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:08,480
The ceiling is covered in cobwebs and in some areas traces
of monster slime are present.

2644
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:14,500
This is the terrible...

2645
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:16,740
This is such a bad font.

2646
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:18,820
Eurasianally.

2647
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:24,240
The chosen one's body occasionally twitches and mutters
incomprehensible phrases.

2648
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:25,880
So it did do all that.

2649
02:37:26,900 --> 02:37:28,680
With the face on his tongue and everything.

2650
02:37:29,340 --> 02:37:30,340
Chosen one!

2651
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:33,920
The entire cabin feels alive from the inside.

2652
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:36,080
Entering it induces a strange sensation.

2653
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:39,160
The second half of the cabin is infected by the anomaly.

2654
02:37:39,660 --> 02:37:41,640
Further evidence collection is not possible.

2655
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:43,140
What the hell is going on?

2656
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:47,220
Whoa.

2657
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:49,080
2-2-5.

2658
02:37:50,420 --> 02:37:51,700
Is that the missing walkie?

2659
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:53,820
2-2-5.

2660
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,320
Was there another code that we needed?

2661
02:37:57,980 --> 02:37:59,100
2-2-5.

2662
02:37:59,260 --> 02:37:59,820
I'm coming.

2663
02:38:00,340 --> 02:38:01,520
Chosen one.

2664
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:02,940
I'm coming.

2665
02:38:04,420 --> 02:38:06,800
Wee-wee.

2666
02:38:06,900 --> 02:38:07,640
Clock info.

2667
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:08,700
Oh, that's right.

2668
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:09,700
So what do I...

2669
02:38:09,700 --> 02:38:14,500
Okay, I'm going to open clock location and see what happens.

2670
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:22,560
look under the sixth wooden plank from the cabin door that's
where the clock is hidden gathering fragments of what

2671
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:28,760
remains I managed to create the clock just like the report
plan showed apparently has the power to bring back

2672
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:35,100
everything that was killed in the park so you bring back
everything that died but you sacrifice yourself that seems

2673
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:44,930
sixth from the door is that what it said

2674
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:53,300
Creepy.

2675
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,520
2-2-5.

2676
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:01,160
Should I look for the watch under the floorboards?

2677
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:04,780
Wait, we get a decision!

2678
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:08,920
But what about the... Wait, okay, so I guess this is
where...

2679
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:09,640
Can I save?

2680
02:39:10,120 --> 02:39:11,240
No, dang it.

2681
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:22,340
I guess this is where you can either continue towards the
heart and defeat the evil, or you can bring everybody back

2682
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:27,440
and sacrifice yourself

2683
02:39:44,110 --> 02:39:54,990
it's rewind time I don't know what if they yeah I think we
should defeat the evil no what prevents a loop from forming

2684
02:39:54,990 --> 02:40:02,670
with the watch that's what I'm saying yeah we should defeat
the evil no deal no deal

2685
02:40:08,330 --> 02:40:09,310
Parked illegally.

2686
02:40:10,530 --> 02:40:12,450
Uh, outdated information.

2687
02:40:15,130 --> 02:40:17,090
We're still just doing my work, man.

2688
02:40:17,450 --> 02:40:19,510
I'm a slave to the machine.

2689
02:40:23,870 --> 02:40:25,730
The heart is almost here.

2690
02:40:25,850 --> 02:40:26,830
Here we go, here we go.

2691
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:32,400
Yeah, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

2692
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:33,340
Oh.

2693
02:40:38,380 --> 02:40:39,620
Was that correct?

2694
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:42,760
Yeah!

2695
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:46,380
Still got a good old rating.

2696
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:49,500
The heart!

2697
02:40:52,690 --> 02:40:53,470
The heart.

2698
02:40:54,750 --> 02:40:55,470
I did it.

2699
02:40:56,270 --> 02:40:57,610
It's time to end this slaughter.

2700
02:40:57,890 --> 02:40:59,550
This massacre, once and for all.

2701
02:41:00,390 --> 02:41:02,210
So many innocent people are already gone.

2702
02:41:02,810 --> 02:41:03,930
It's time to finish this.

2703
02:41:04,910 --> 02:41:06,290
It's for you, John!

2704
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:07,250
Henry!

2705
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:17,480
Where to go?

2706
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:25,620
Fascinating.

2707
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:30,040
Don't you think so, William?

2708
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:32,920
Stay away from me!

2709
02:41:33,360 --> 02:41:34,120
You monster!

2710
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:37,000
Monster?

2711
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:40,960
You call us monsters because we kill.

2712
02:41:42,380 --> 02:41:45,700
But I only kill those who deserve it.

2713
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:51,040
And what the hell did all those innocent people do to
deserve it?

2714
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:53,240
All those bodies, all that blood.

2715
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:55,980
Innocent.

2716
02:41:57,100 --> 02:42:03,680
For years, humans have shown no respect for the forests,
destroying nature, polluting everything.

2717
02:42:05,420 --> 02:42:10,360
All reports are just a tiny glimpse of the devastation your
kind brings.

2718
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:14,420
You don't see it, do you?

2719
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:19,900
I came to this world and lived in these woods for over
500,000 years.

2720
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:31,160
years 500 years oh my gosh do you know how old this planet
is you've been here for that's like a baby stop acting like

2721
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:37,840
you're the owner of the forest what the hell this guy i'm

2722
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:59,450
gonna say five million at least geez anyway observing and i
realized it's humans who are the true monsters not us they

2723
02:42:59,450 --> 02:43:13,150
are parasites that need to be removed imagine it a world
covered in endless forest dark woods growing freely thriving

2724
02:43:13,150 --> 02:43:26,930
without humans and what about us the park rangers we protect
the forest they

2725
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:48,200
will fight to save nature are you going to kill them too we
couldn't see you we can't see anything don't lump everyone

2726
02:43:48,200 --> 02:44:03,940
together not everyone deserves your justice that is true
which is why I haven't unless you refuse sorry

2727
02:44:26,590 --> 02:44:40,730
an offer for you one you can't refuse your friend already
tried to warn you about it which is disappointing i wanted

2728
02:44:40,730 --> 02:44:42,010
to present it my

2729
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:54,620
i'm not doing anything for you this is giving like
castlevania you steal men's souls and make them your slaves

2730
02:44:54,620 --> 02:45:26,900
someone chose to complete Last report.

2731
02:45:31,960 --> 02:45:33,900
And that's my offer.

2732
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:37,390
I'll leave.

2733
02:45:39,290 --> 02:45:41,830
And if I don't complete it, will I die?

2734
02:45:44,390 --> 02:45:48,450
If you refuse, I can guarantee your death.

2735
02:45:50,650 --> 02:45:51,730
Choice is yours.

2736
02:45:52,070 --> 02:45:52,450
Question mark?

2737
02:45:52,910 --> 02:45:54,150
Why is there a question mark?

2738
02:45:55,710 --> 02:45:56,710
Why is there a question mark?

2739
02:45:57,330 --> 02:45:58,470
Oh my gosh.

2740
02:45:58,870 --> 02:45:59,990
Is that the last report?

2741
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:03,090
Guys?

2742
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:15,750
do do we fill out the last report and let him leave i legit
thought the game had voice acting for the monster was like

2743
02:46:15,750 --> 02:46:25,270
whoa they left that in didn't do another thing i think we
should do it because it's the name of the game baby save

2744
02:46:25,270 --> 02:46:38,450
scum time i wish i imagine there's checkpoints in this game
maybe hopefully But there are multiple endings for sure.

2745
02:46:39,690 --> 02:46:39,690
Hmm.

2746
02:46:40,490 --> 02:46:40,990
Hmm.

2747
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:45,620
Do it?

2748
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:46,940
Let's do it.

2749
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:48,200
Yes.

2750
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:56,500
Where am I?

2751
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:57,660
Are we in the void?

2752
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:04,640
It's time to do the report.

2753
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:06,760
Ew.

2754
02:47:09,820 --> 02:47:09,980
Oh.

2755
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:10,720
Hello.

2756
02:47:15,110 --> 02:47:17,910
So unfortunately you managed to arrive.

2757
02:47:17,930 --> 02:47:21,790
I had a sliver of hope that you would escape.

2758
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:23,190
Where am I?

2759
02:47:23,570 --> 02:47:24,490
Where is this place?

2760
02:47:25,410 --> 02:47:25,910
Don't worry.

2761
02:47:26,430 --> 02:47:28,010
I know you feel strange right now.

2762
02:47:29,170 --> 02:47:31,790
You are in the void, the edge of the human world.

2763
02:47:31,870 --> 02:47:32,950
Do you think this is the doctor?

2764
02:47:33,750 --> 02:47:37,310
And to answer your next question in advance, I am Mendax.

2765
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:39,090
I was human too.

2766
02:47:39,990 --> 02:47:42,210
Why can't I feel my body?

2767
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:47,350
Because by entering the void, you are no longer fully alive.

2768
02:47:49,530 --> 02:47:51,190
Wait, so I died?

2769
02:47:52,210 --> 02:47:53,090
You could say that.

2770
02:47:53,530 --> 02:47:57,790
Your body remained in your world, but your mind ended up
here.

2771
02:47:59,330 --> 02:48:03,430
Unfortunately, there is no way out without help from someone
in the normal world.

2772
02:48:05,070 --> 02:48:06,010
The same thing happened to you?

2773
02:48:06,490 --> 02:48:07,510
How long have you been here?

2774
02:48:08,270 --> 02:48:10,090
I think 25 years?

2775
02:48:10,290 --> 02:48:12,070
This is not that long at all either.

2776
02:48:12,830 --> 02:48:13,950
I stopped keeping track.

2777
02:48:15,310 --> 02:48:17,490
I hoped you would escape the monster.

2778
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:19,270
But it got you, too.

2779
02:48:20,490 --> 02:48:21,810
Wait, do you know Douglas?

2780
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:22,890
Douglas.

2781
02:48:23,650 --> 02:48:25,370
Yes, he was a close friend of mine.

2782
02:48:25,770 --> 02:48:25,970
Oh!

2783
02:48:27,290 --> 02:48:29,330
It's the guy from the cabin.

2784
02:48:30,070 --> 02:48:31,450
Is he still alive?

2785
02:48:32,190 --> 02:48:34,110
Yes, he told me about your death.

2786
02:48:35,330 --> 02:48:36,910
I'm starting to feel sick.

2787
02:48:37,330 --> 02:48:38,230
My head's spinning.

2788
02:48:38,930 --> 02:48:39,870
It's only temporary.

2789
02:48:40,450 --> 02:48:41,970
Everything should stabilize soon.

2790
02:48:43,710 --> 02:48:44,830
Soon meaning when?

2791
02:48:44,910 --> 02:48:45,910
I can barely speak.

2792
02:48:46,570 --> 02:48:47,770
Your body is adjusting.

2793
02:48:50,170 --> 02:48:51,810
It's better now.

2794
02:48:52,170 --> 02:48:53,310
Hey, look at me.

2795
02:48:54,130 --> 02:48:56,770
Oh, he's just a little guy.

2796
02:48:57,590 --> 02:49:00,610
Oh, just look at it.

2797
02:49:00,910 --> 02:49:01,970
Oh, my gosh, it's animated.

2798
02:49:02,890 --> 02:49:03,590
Isn't it beautiful?

2799
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:09,820
Whoa.

2800
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:11,240
Amazing.

2801
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:15,120
The edge of everything good and sadly everything dark.

2802
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:20,320
But don't worry.

2803
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:21,720
Not anymore.

2804
02:49:23,540 --> 02:49:24,100
Come with me.

2805
02:49:28,220 --> 02:49:29,120
Is that me?

2806
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:30,820
Oh my gosh, I'm skinny legend.

2807
02:49:33,060 --> 02:49:35,960
Real monster, how long is the bureaucratic paperwork?

2808
02:49:41,500 --> 02:49:43,580
I'll help you cross the void.

2809
02:49:46,900 --> 02:49:48,400
Walk with me through this journey.

2810
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:50,020
Wait, suddenly I'm playing journey?

2811
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:51,740
We'll find a way out.

2812
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:52,640
I promise.

2813
02:49:55,100 --> 02:49:56,040
I promise.

2814
02:49:57,180 --> 02:49:58,400
Break your promise, break your pinky.

2815
02:50:08,770 --> 02:50:09,410
What?

2816
02:50:22,450 --> 02:50:23,170
Sticky keys!

2817
02:50:23,470 --> 02:50:24,230
Sticky keys!

2818
02:50:28,040 --> 02:50:30,560
The final report has been submitted.

2819
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:32,360
Complete the game.

2820
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:35,840
Wait, that's where the missing walkie-talkie went!

2821
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:50,160
Neat!

2822
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:52,700
Wait, I lied to this ending though.

2823
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:54,260
It was pretty interesting.

2824
02:51:02,450 --> 02:51:05,770
Just like some eldritch creature being a weirdo.

2825
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:10,590
What was 225?

2826
02:51:10,730 --> 02:51:11,270
I don't know.

2827
02:51:11,830 --> 02:51:16,290
There's different endings, obviously, because there's many
choices we didn't do.

2828
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:29,180
I'm gonna see if we can checkpoint back to the clock,
because I want to try that ending, too.

2829
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:32,460
All the sound effects.

2830
02:51:32,860 --> 02:51:37,480
Hey, my man is utilizing his resources.

2831
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:43,540
A very young eldritch creature.

2832
02:51:47,380 --> 02:51:53,560
Switch on Hum, Rain Moderate, A.Wave, Computer Glitching,
System Notification.

2833
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:56,620
Wait, then that means it really was a Sticky Keys.

2834
02:51:57,920 --> 02:52:00,640
Drinking Tea, Slurping, Sipping, and Gulp 3.

2835
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:11,080
Fonts that may have been used Get rid of the one that made
it look like Oompooter.

2836
02:52:19,700 --> 02:52:22,020
If you read this, you're awesome.

2837
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:24,420
We're awesome, you guys.

2838
02:52:24,620 --> 02:52:25,140
We're awesome.

2839
02:52:31,450 --> 02:52:32,910
What a neat little game.

2840
02:52:41,350 --> 02:52:44,770
So we came to the void and was like trying to figure his way
out.

2841
02:52:45,190 --> 02:52:47,310
Wait, um, wait, what's...

2842
02:52:47,310 --> 02:52:48,170
Oh, skip cutscene.

2843
02:52:48,470 --> 02:52:49,710
Okay, the cutscene is still happening.

2844
02:52:56,430 --> 02:52:57,030
Wee!

2845
02:52:57,410 --> 02:52:59,330
Welcome to membership, thank you!

2846
02:53:01,890 --> 02:53:03,370
When does it end, though?

2847
02:53:14,980 --> 02:53:16,320
Oh, there we go.

2848
02:53:18,100 --> 02:53:19,480
Just wait for the song to end.

2849
02:53:20,300 --> 02:53:23,160
Let's try and see if we can do the clock ending.

2850
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:24,860
I think that would be fun.

2851
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:30,400
And, uh...

2852
02:53:30,400 --> 02:53:31,360
No!

2853
02:53:31,980 --> 02:53:32,420
No!

2854
02:53:32,760 --> 02:53:33,360
No!

2855
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:37,300
Well, I guess not.

2856
02:53:38,700 --> 02:53:40,280
Wait, did I really have to save?

2857
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:42,340
Was there a save feature?

2858
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:46,640
Dang.

2859
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:51,860
Well, it was still fun.

2860
02:53:52,840 --> 02:53:55,520
I think the game had some really creepy moments.

2861
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:57,000
Good atmosphere.

2862
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:03,220
I, you know, I enjoy these kind of like atmospheric horror
games.

2863
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:06,040
It's like silly at the same time.

2864
02:54:10,220 --> 02:54:11,640
Game really spoke to me.

2865
02:54:11,800 --> 02:54:16,620
I too feel as though I've slipped into some sort of
meaningless void when I have to put out paperwork.

2866
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:21,140
Look up the endings.

2867
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:23,300
I guess I could try.

2868
02:54:24,340 --> 02:54:26,940
But I feel if you...

2869
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:27,420
Let's see.

2870
02:54:27,560 --> 02:54:29,000
The game wasn't very expensive.

2871
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:30,660
Either.

2872
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:33,860
I almost wish I could speedrun.

2873
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:35,000
Sorry, that's the trailer.

2874
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:36,220
If you heard that.

2875
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:37,640
Yeah, it's on sale.

2876
02:54:37,640 --> 02:54:39,580
It's even on sale right now for $4.

2877
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:45,200
Like, super inexpensive.

2878
02:54:48,340 --> 02:54:49,140
Dang it.

2879
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:51,940
I wish, I wish, I wish that there were...

2880
02:54:51,940 --> 02:54:52,980
If I had...

2881
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:55,160
If I had known...

2882
02:54:56,860 --> 02:54:59,880
I would have been saving, but also...

2883
02:54:59,880 --> 02:55:03,540
I wish when they give you choices, they allow you to do a
save, you know?

2884
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:07,060
Drifter's really fun pixel horror mystery point and click
fully voiced to you.

2885
02:55:07,140 --> 02:55:07,520
You should check it out.

2886
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:08,960
Oh, I'll write it down.

2887
02:55:09,160 --> 02:55:09,420
Look it out.

2888
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:10,720
Thank you.

2889
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:14,540
Only Mint Phantom would actually the ancient forest demon.

2890
02:55:16,140 --> 02:55:21,260
Okay, but he wanted to act all like, I've been here for so
long.

2891
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:24,380
Like, um, 500 years?

2892
02:55:25,700 --> 02:55:25,920
Okay.

2893
02:55:26,860 --> 02:55:30,760
Buddy, you are, you are, you've seen nothing.

2894
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:33,140
How do you?

2895
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:35,000
Let's see if I can start a new game.

2896
02:55:36,220 --> 02:55:38,540
Like how we figure out how to save.

2897
02:55:41,300 --> 02:55:42,920
I'm skipping cutscene.

2898
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:46,000
I do always appreciate those kinds of things, though.

2899
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:47,680
Okay, let's see.

2900
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:49,260
Skip, skip, skip.

2901
02:55:51,960 --> 02:55:53,080
Ah, um.

2902
02:55:53,580 --> 02:55:55,040
How do you save?

2903
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:07,180
Huh.

2904
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:10,560
I don't think you can.

2905
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:16,200
I think maybe it auto saves when you exit the game.

2906
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:19,420
Not as old as Afterlife Minto.

2907
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:21,200
Wait a second.

2908
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:27,860
Where my Google tells me it saves at checkpoints.

2909
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:28,960
No manual saves.

2910
02:56:29,560 --> 02:56:30,940
Ah, I see.

2911
02:56:33,060 --> 02:56:34,020
Aw, man.

2912
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:39,300
Give me a second.

2913
02:56:39,400 --> 02:56:40,380
Let me see if I can find...

2914
02:56:42,380 --> 02:56:47,320
Easy video with the other What the other What's it called?

2915
02:56:48,980 --> 02:56:49,460
Endings.

2916
02:56:49,740 --> 02:56:50,600
What's this game?

2917
02:56:51,340 --> 02:56:54,000
Last report All endings

2918
02:56:57,680 --> 02:57:10,960
Oh wow Wait Oh These videos are all extremely long Wait what
the heck This one is like last report stories And endings

2919
02:57:15,740 --> 02:57:18,560
these videos are like an hour long

2920
02:57:22,230 --> 02:57:30,310
there's manly badass hero but even his is two hours almost
two hours 500 years is barely a teenager yeah

2921
02:57:34,820 --> 02:57:52,080
huh huh huh i can't obviously i'm not gonna watch an hour's
worth of video yo somebody else's somebody else's stuff so

2922
02:57:52,080 --> 02:58:10,640
um if you want to if you want to um see the other endings
you might have to play the game yourself uh yeah oh man

2923
02:58:10,640 --> 02:58:16,660
manlies is not the only one manlies is two hours but there's
another one that's like all endings and it's an hour and 11

2924
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:24,140
minutes Most of all of these are like full ending, or like
full game plus ending, I think.

2925
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:29,400
So I'm not going to like sift through the whole thing to
figure out what's what.

2926
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:30,080
That's okay.

2927
02:58:30,620 --> 02:58:31,020
That's okay.

2928
02:58:32,620 --> 02:58:34,080
I still like the ending we got.

2929
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:35,640
I think it was interesting.

2930
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:37,960
I'm very curious about the clock, though.

2931
02:58:40,340 --> 02:58:41,900
What a neat little game.

2932
02:58:42,200 --> 02:58:43,580
What a neat little game.

2933
02:58:48,220 --> 02:58:48,700
Hmm.

2934
02:58:50,240 --> 02:58:52,680
Minto will save herself from becoming a react channel.

2935
02:58:54,700 --> 02:59:01,100
I mean, I've had to do it before in the past, but I don't
like doing it, so I try to avoid it if I can.

2936
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:03,460
Ah, and another to the list.

2937
02:59:03,560 --> 02:59:03,900
Yeah!

2938
02:59:04,840 --> 02:59:08,180
Another game to my completion list.

2939
02:59:08,860 --> 02:59:09,660
Last report.

2940
02:59:09,800 --> 02:59:10,980
Let me do that right now.

2941
02:59:11,900 --> 02:59:13,400
Nice, nice, nice.

2942
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:16,020
12, 9.

2943
02:59:16,360 --> 02:59:16,900
2025.

2944
02:59:18,540 --> 02:59:19,440
Last report.

2945
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:20,320
Yeah!

2946
02:59:22,340 --> 02:59:25,060
There should be a couple other games that we knock out this
week.

2947
02:59:26,260 --> 02:59:27,560
So, cool, cool, cool.

2948
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:32,420
Spoiler right now, there is no difference between the
choices in the last confrontation.

2949
02:59:32,660 --> 02:59:34,540
Same stuff aside from being mutilated by the ghoul.

2950
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:35,800
Oh, no way, seriously?

2951
02:59:36,340 --> 02:59:37,340
Wait, that's so lame.

2952
02:59:37,860 --> 02:59:43,300
Wait, so if I say no, he just mutilates me and I get sent to
the void anyway?

2953
02:59:44,180 --> 02:59:44,580
Lame.

2954
02:59:48,010 --> 02:59:55,770
So I guess it's really just a big difference between the
clock and between this ending but also i feel like the clock

2955
02:59:55,770 --> 03:00:07,070
you also meet a bad fate so i wonder if it also sends you to
the void everything's a lose-lose yeah choice of but an

2956
03:00:07,070 --> 03:00:18,590
illusion oh man okay i'm gonna send you guys back over here
where you belong and me too i don't feel i don't feel right

2957
03:00:18,590 --> 03:00:30,070
being over I feel uncomfortable but I had fun I hope you
guys did too I thought it was a neat little game I think I

2958
03:00:30,070 --> 03:00:39,290
think if they like added more anomaly stuff that happens
that would be really neat even if it's like a game like this

2959
03:00:39,290 --> 03:00:49,270
that's less scripted and like you just are doing like you're
filing reports and I also like would want more I would want

2960
03:00:49,270 --> 03:00:59,350
this game more different more things to search for in the
reports and more random anomaly stuff that happens in the

2961
03:00:59,350 --> 03:01:08,670
background that like more horror things that goes on right
obviously this one is a little more like uh uh linear it's

2962
03:01:08,670 --> 03:01:15,550
like a storytelling so but if it's like a rent like a game
like that were ever to be made it would be so much fun for

2963
03:01:15,550 --> 03:01:28,530
me please and this that that this kind of combines it with
like the horror elements of like stuff going on in the

2964
03:01:28,530 --> 03:01:35,430
background there's definitely some stuff that could be
expanded on yeah but for like a little indie game this was

2965
03:01:35,430 --> 03:01:42,330
not bad this was really good i'd say so orgo thank you so
much for the pink remember chosen minto don't be on the side

2966
03:01:42,330 --> 03:01:45,410
of bad and wrong don't be badong

2967
03:01:49,230 --> 03:01:52,650
Sorry, not sure if evil monster paperwork is badong or just
lame.

2968
03:01:54,570 --> 03:01:56,330
Fun, chill, spooky game for sure.

2969
03:01:56,890 --> 03:01:58,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2970
03:01:58,170 --> 03:01:58,570
That was fun.

2971
03:02:01,290 --> 03:02:02,350
Cool, cool, cool.

2972
03:02:03,430 --> 03:02:04,870
But I'm gonna end it here.

2973
03:02:04,950 --> 03:02:06,170
I'm actually so hungry.

2974
03:02:06,750 --> 03:02:07,770
I didn't eat dinner.

2975
03:02:08,470 --> 03:02:10,750
I kind of snacked and I was like, I'll be fine.

2976
03:02:10,970 --> 03:02:11,530
But now I'm hungry.

2977
