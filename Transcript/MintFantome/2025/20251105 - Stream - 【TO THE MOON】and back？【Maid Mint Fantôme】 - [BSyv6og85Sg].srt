00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Oh my

2
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,580
gosh, it scared me.

3
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,540
Why is it so loud?

4
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Wait, hold on.

5
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,660
I didn't have it in with headphones on.

6
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Oh my gosh.

7
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,120
Hello, everybody.

8
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,280
One second.

9
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,800
Hold on.

10
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,540
I'm going to...

11
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,960
Maybe it's right.

12
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,820
This is 75.

13
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,200
For anybody who's like...

14
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,380
I didn't actually could hear it.

15
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,100
So I was like, I didn't realize it was so loud.

16
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,540
Spook to me.

17
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,380
Spook to me.

18
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,360
I thought this was not supposed to be a scary game.

19
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,360
I thought it wasn't supposed to be a scary game.

20
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,940
Wow!

I'm trying to think of another example.

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,500
Something nice!

64
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,000
Why can't I think of anything?

65
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,210
I don't know.

66
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,330
I can't think of anything.

67
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,530
Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.

68
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,350
Pocky Day is on the 11th.

69
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,350
That is so true.

70
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,610
That day is the Pocky Day.

71
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,070
That is Pocky Day.

72
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,930
Happy Oshy Day.

73
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,590

Thank you.

76
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,710
I'm honored to be your Oshy if I am.

77
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,350
E...

78
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,390
Maru Maru?

79
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,110
Maru Maru nohi?

80
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,570

82
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,750
I'm like looking on some...

83
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,670
Oh, this is like some person's blog or something.

84
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,090
Is there a nice white pun today?

85
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,350
There is.

86
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,970
Like there's like...

87
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,570
Thank you!

88
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,890
That's my kamioshi, Deleran!

89
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,090
Why doesn't this list anything though?

90
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,450
So good good opie, good opie, good tummy.

91
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,730
Good meat.

92
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,530
Hearing you say you're honored to be by Oshi, maybe blush for some reason.

93
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,270
I love.

94
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,830
Wow.

95
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:40,910
So yeah, it's always fun because on Twitter you'll get like all the artists who will post stuff on those days.

96
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,390
So it's fun.

97
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,350
Happy Yoshi Day.

98
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,950
Happy Yoshi Day everybody.

99
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,410
Thank you so much.

100
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,370
I have a lot of Yoshi but Minto is my Kamiyoshi.

101
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,770
Thank you!

102
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,890
But today we're playing a game.

103
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,570
I think this game is a little longer too, so I would like to beat it today.

104
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,890
I don't want to probably put it in two parts.

105
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,790
To the moon!

106
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,410
I've never played this game before.

107
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,230
I've seen other VTubers play it, but I've never like watched it.

108
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,450
So I'm going in basically completely blind.

109
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,650
It's my birthday!

110
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,130
Memory of my youth.

111
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,330
Just a moment's silence.

112
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,270
Monarch, happy birthday.

113
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,550
A moment's silence?

114
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,960
My advice for today, watch Min Van Tove and use code boomer on gamer subs.

115
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,500
See, see, thank you.

116
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,480
So I guess we could just begin then.

117
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,880
Wait, I kind of want some mood lighting for this.

118
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,440
decided I wanted it.

119
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,140
I decided I want mood lighting.

120
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Whoa!

121
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,760
Even with the moon shining on me.

122
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Jay!

123
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,560
Thank you!

124
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,760
Tomorrow's my birthday!

125
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,140
So many birthdays!

126
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Happy, happy birthday!

127
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,520
Happy birthday, Jay!

128
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,420
Thank you!

129
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
Thank you for the pink!

130
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,780
Did you guys know that today is a super moon?

131
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,660
So...

132
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,280
Actually, it's so fitting.

133
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,840
It's the super moon.

134
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,620
The moon has been so bright lately.

135
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,040
So, to the moon!

136
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,560
To the moon we go!

137
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,760
It's peak timing.

138
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,260
Do I need to play- Can I play this with Mouse?

139
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,380
Or do I need a controller?

140
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,400
Oh!

141
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,960
Mouse works bust?

142
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,720
Okay, okay.

143
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,400
And let me know how the audio is and everything too, so...

144
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,580
Point and click.

145
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,440
Oh, okay, okay.

146
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,240
Aww.

147
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,540
Happy Yoshi Day.

148
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,460
Happy Yoshi Day.

149
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:47,930
Whoa!

150
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,230
That doesn't sound good.

151
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,750
Oh, my God.

152
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,250
The heck was that in the...

153
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,870
Is that a squirrel?

154
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,470
Yeah, I see.

155
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,570
Thank you, guys.

156
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,070
Thank you.

157
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,390
Where were you looking, Neil?

158
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:13,030
Well, excuse me for heroically evading that squail coming out of nowhere.

159
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,470
No way.

160
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,450
You ran over it!

161
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,070
Death.

162
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,370
Death's penalty.

163
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,750
Excuse me, princess.

164
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,970
Oh, my god.

165
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,290
Oh, you ran over it anyway.

166
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,010
You ran over it and hit a tree.

167
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,110
There was something, like, kind of weird looking, that scammer.

168
00:14:34,130 --> 00:15:05,770
off up in the corner though look don't worry it's a company car I think that's even worse are you kidding me the boss is going to kill us hmm we'll just say I was saving a puppy oh my gosh and happy birthday he likes puppies right he's more of a cat person why does the world have to be so complicated Fine.

169
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,610
Whatever furball he fancies.

170
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,670
Crisis averted.

171
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,150
Good.

172
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,210
Go write that on your report later.

173
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,610
Let's grab the equipment from the car and move already.

174
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:16,790
Oh.

175
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,130
Oh, I thought the squirrel was part of the...

176
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,270
Can I take the squirrel?

177
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,850
Tisk, tisk.

178
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:28,990
Oh, come on.

179
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,670
I crashed the car while trying to evade it.

180
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,570
What more do you want?

181
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,590
Not crashed the car and evade it?

182
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

183
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,290
That's asking too much.

184
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,370
What was over?

185
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,610
What is this?

186
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:47,950
Oh my gosh.

187
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,190
Wild's household ahead.

188
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,990
Putting up a sign where they live in the middle of nowhere is like asking to be robbed.

189
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,950
We move so fast.

190
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,450
What the heck is that?

191
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,010
Hey, the equipment's still in the car.

192
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,050
Oh, my bad.

193
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,590
Received equipment?

194
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,430
Got this sucker.

195
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,750
Let's roll.

196
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,350
Oh, but what's... Oh, wait, we can go either way.

197
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,650
Let's go this way.

198
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,790
The sign to the house points the other way.

199
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,910
Oh, how kind of it to exist.

200
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,510
Oh, now we're thinking that is a nice thing to have.

201
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,030
Maddie, thank you!

202
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,510
Hey, wait, don't forget the car.

203
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,710
Just wanted to see if you'd remember.

204
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,070
Oh, there we go.

205
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,610
How thoughtful of you.

206
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,740
Look at that bird.

207
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,550
It's been a long time since I've played like an RPG maker game, you know?

208
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:52,850
What?

209
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,430
What's with these trees?

210
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,490
Why are they bald?

211
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,700
Sorry guys, I tried.

212
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,620
Okay, I'm not gonna explore so much.

213
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,400
We don't need to.

214
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,700
Wait, what did I...

215
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,600
What the heck was that?

216
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,860
Oh my gosh, I can pet the bird!

217
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,250
Pokemon!

218
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:49,650
boulder here maybe it's their security system cucumbers we don't have time for this fluff let's try pushing it out of the way where's your whimsy yeah strength hm please maybe we could find a tree branch to jack it with wait or we could just call it a night and blame it on that no i'm not gonna go home i think we could Push it by hand.

219
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,210
Alright.

220
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,030
On three.

221
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,630
One, two, three!

222
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,160
What?

223
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,300
I don't even...

224
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,020
Which was that?

225
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,460
Wait, why did it...

226
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,240
Not a boulder.

227
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,440
That's for sure.

228
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
Oh my gosh, imagine if they left.

229
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,360
We need to get going for now.

230
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,460
We'll figure that thing out later.

231
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,220
Right.

232
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,200
Why was it squishy?

233
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,740
Oh, oh, those were like some more squirrels or something.

234
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm just going along the pathway.

235
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,480
Oh, I guess I should be looking around and seeing if I can click on anything.

236
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,900
Sounds so pretty.

237
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,540
I want to go to the beach.

238
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
I want to go to the beach.

239
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,110
I don't want to live in a lighthouse, though.

240
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,950
There's too many...

241
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,810
Lighthouses are too cramped for ghosts.

242
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,710
There's so many other ghosts in there.

243
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,640
Oh, I thought he was talking to her.

244
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,000
I was about to be like, that's another child.

245
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,620
All colors.

246
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,600
Thank you so much for the fun.

247
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,240
Good to see you.

248
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,500
What about crab ghosts?

249
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
What about them?

250
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,320
Fish slander, how?

251
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,780
I'm saying for a ghost, it's very crowded.

252
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,100
If you're a normal person, maybe if you don't have a strong sixth sense, you'd be fine.

253
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,860
Not a bad place to retire at, huh?

254
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,960
I could do better.

255
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,960
This guy.

256
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,960
Night shifts, love them or hate them.

257
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,360
You know the answer, you stupid owl.

258
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Dang.

259
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,660
Mr. Owl.

260
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,140
It's probably gonna be another all-nighter, you know.

261
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,700
I know.

262
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,040
And I doubt they'd have any coffee.

263
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,220
Why wouldn't they have coffee?

264
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Shut up.

265
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,730
And the ocean waves will sing lullabies.

266
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,490
Not through your blathering, they won't.

267
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,130
Sky.

268
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,290
Man, thank you so much.

269
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,670
Happy Kamiyoshi Day.

270
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,490
Me, no word smart.

271
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,190
Thank you.

272
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,030
Don't forget the equipment, moron.

273
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,460
I don't get paid enough for this.

274
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,180
This guy is making me sleepy.

275
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,570
Act 1.

276
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,770
I never told anyone, but I always thought they were lighthouses.

277
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,050
They might be.

278
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,770
What else could they be?

279
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,290
Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosaline, I presume?

280
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,410
Thanks for coming on such a short notice.

281
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,830
What if they're trying to exercise this place?

282
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,670
That's okay.

283
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,850
I tend to be bad at predicting deaths as well.

284
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,550
Oh, wait, somebody did die!

285
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,430
Are you the patient's daughter?

286
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,570
Oh, no, I'm just his caretaker.

287
00:21:51,610 --> 00:22:53,530
and these are my children Sarah and Tommy they just run around because they're crazy someone's dead and they're just they're just going nuts so in the house it's not exactly a nine to five job so Johnny lets us live here Johnny I suppose this Johnny is our man Johnny's dead Johnny listen if it's a kid we're dealing with I don't think we're the ones you want no no he just prefers to be called that he's a young at heart he's upstairs right now with his medical doctor Johnny come with me wait he's still alive or what's going on I'm scared I don't want to see a dead body come on grab that case and let's go when my back breaks one day I'll sue you with the insurance claim this is so out of pocket it.

288
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,690
Grab it.

289
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,010
Receive the equipment.

290
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:00,630
Alright.

291
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,570
Let's head upstairs before I drop this.

292
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,670
Go upstairs.

293
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,590
Wait, can I go other places?

294
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,070
Like here?

295
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,950
The patient is waiting upstairs.

296
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,910
Better not waste time.

297
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,550
Okay, okay.

298
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,210
We're going.

299
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,510
I'm observing.

300
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,350
I'm pointing and clicking.

301
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:19,950
Oh!

302
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:22,950
It's...

303
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,210
Bones o'clock.

304
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,250
Wait, what is this?

305
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,870
I could take it.

306
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,650
I could steal.

307
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,040
Four River.

308
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,620
By Johnny.

309
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,820
What kind of a song is this?

310
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,980
It's just two notes repeated over and over.

311
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,220
What is it?

312
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,060
Oh, no, not the whole time.

313
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,620
Oh, I guess a little bit.

314
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,200
Four River.

315
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,380
Let's go upstairs then.

316
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:08,120
Oh my gosh I'm not a huge fan of the walking It's kind of awkward Okay they're gone Whoever gets there first gets to play the melody

317
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:21,540
No fair you pushed me Did not Whatever you get the boring two notes anyway

318
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,000
Those kids are pretty good for their age Hey You're the one who said there was no time to waste.

319
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,660
And incidentally, I'm the one who is carrying the weight of a small meteoroid.

320
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,520
Yeah, yeah, come on.

321
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,400
Oh my god.

322
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,100
The music stopped.

323
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:14,840
Hello?

324
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,800
Ready to set up?

325
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,900
Look around first.

326
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,820
Gee, you know, I think I'd like to carry this excruciatingly heavy object around some more.

327
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,320
Thanks for asking me, though.

328
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,480
Johnny?

329
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,220
Selection of readings for medical journals.

330
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,940
I don't think there's really...

331
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,200
Oh wait, can I go through here?

332
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,720
Oh, bye!

333
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,880
What's that?

334
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,780
There's something shiny down here.

335
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,700
Oh, the light.

336
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,160
Oh, he won't be needing that anymore.

337
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,140
Let's see what we got here.

338
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,600
It won't...

339
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
Why can't I click on it?

340
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,320
Like, it says I can click on it, but when I click on it, nothing happens.

341
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,640
Pretty sure you don't have to use the mouse to move.

342
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,040
I'm not!

343
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,860
I am sometimes clicking, but I'm using arrow keys.

344
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,060
He's unresponsive at this point, but by the looks of things, he's still consciously hanging on.

345
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,980
It's hard to say how long you'll have, but I would hurry.

346
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,120
Ready to set up?

347
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Okay.

348
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,040
Yes.

349
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,240
It'll just be a moment.

350
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
What are we setting up?

351
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,500
Are we transferring his consciousness into the machine?

352
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,720
We're making him a robot body.

353
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,980
Are you sure a common household power outlet is sufficient?

354
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,060
No worries.

355
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,020
We're the experts.

356
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,980
Putting him into the metaverse, so...

357
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,580
Oh crap.

358
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,620
Pirate, thank you!

359
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
What do you mean you don't know if it counts?

360
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,720
Of course it counts.

361
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,160
Standard procedures, just keeping you on your toes.

362
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,400
Whoa, whoa!

363
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,100
We are putting him in the metaverse!

364
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,410
Metaverse?

365
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:28,910
No!

366
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,250
This world is...

367
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,310
How's he doing?

368
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:34,830
Not so well.

369
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,570
If I were to say he's got just a day or two left.

370
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,990
That's plenty of time.

371
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,290
The Mintoverse.

372
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,770
So you two can grant him any wish, huh?

373
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,170
To try at least.

374
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,490
But we always succeed because we're awesome.

375
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,430
Awesome, awesome.

376
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,770
So what's the wish?

377
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,790
The moon.

378
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,830
Oh my gosh.

379
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,890
What's that guy in the minions movie?

380
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,590
Oh my god, Gru!

381
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,350
Yeah!

382
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,870
It's Gru!

383
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,250
The moon?

384
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,850
Gru, aka Johnny.

385
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,170
The moon.

386
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,090
He wants to go to the moon.

387
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,910
The geysers just keep on getting crazier, huh?

388
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,650
So can you do it?

389
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,670
It depends.

390
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,050
She meant to say yes.

391
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,170
Why don't you tell us about our client here?

392
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,970
That I don't really know much.

393
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,690
Johnny's an odd man.

394
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,990
Through the two years that I've worked here, he rarely spoke.

395
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,770
He worked as a craftsman for most of his life.

396
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,850
and his wife passed away two years ago.

397
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,430
Aww.

398
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,070
Moon.

399
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,030
I don't really know many details.

400
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,390
I would have known more if I were his paper boy for Pete's sake.

401
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,930
Shush, just do your thing.

402
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,830
Dr. Watts is this guy.

403
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,470
Well, I suppose if you look around the house, he may find some more info.

404
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,590
I suppose Johnny wouldn't mind since he signed for you two.

405
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,620
Hmm, so be it.

406
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,540
Alright, which one of us plays Detective?

407
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,800
I want to be Dr. Rosaline.

408
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,300
Dr. Watts is a weirdo.

409
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,260
Thanks for the offer, but I'm busy leaving a butt print on this chair.

410
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,780
Right, do continue.

411
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,260
Tommy and Sarah can show you around.

412
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,700
They're probably at the piano downstairs.

413
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,020
Alright.

414
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,720
Okay, let's try these again.

415
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:17,620

I really appreciate it.

419
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,090
Let's talk to the children.

420
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,430
What you want?

421
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,370
No, I keep playing.

422
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,830
I quit bothering.

423
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:35,770
Wow.

424
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,550
Just the beef.

425
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,410
Wait, no, no, no, no.

426
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,810
Candy can!

427
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,270
Uh, turn the light on.

428
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,630
It's got some garbage.

429
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,050
Okay, not much else going on in the kitchen.

430
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,910
The beef.

431
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,310
Oh, sometimes the perspective is not so great.

432
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,610
You guys know I have...

433
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,190
Oh, I better ask those kids first.

434
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,110
Oh, we'll go over here.

435
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,210
I'm turning on...

436
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,030
I'm wasting their electricity bill like crazy right now.

437
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,610
Turn on and store tap water.

438
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,090
Sure.

439
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,370
I don't know why we need to do that, but who knows?

440
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,370
Look at these loaves of bread!

441
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,130
And they go downstairs?

442
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:34,670
No.

443
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,110
Okay, children, children!

444
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,490
Show me around the house, children!

445
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,330
Sarah and Tommy, right?

446
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,750
Your mother said to ask you two to show me around the house.

447
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,070
Okay.

448
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,050
Maybe we will.

449
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:51,530
Maybe.

450
00:32:52,050 --> 00:34:04,530

There we go.

454
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:30,980
Okay.

455
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,940
Terrible calories.

456
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,820
Wait, no, no.

457
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,740
I'm not trying to go that way.

458
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,860
Okay, there we go.

459
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,260
Too short.

460
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,040
Just like...

461
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,720
Just for...

462
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,360
Like for real.

463
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,020
Okay, I got what you wanted.

464
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:47,880
Good old.

465
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,340
Candy cane.png candy cane.

466
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,740
If you come and give me a tour of this instant, I won't sneeze on it.

467
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,740
The side eye.

468
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,440
They were like, what did you just say?

469
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,100
What did you just say?

470
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,740
Where do we start?

471
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,300
I know.

472
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,180
There's this funny room in the basement.

473
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,980
I don't like that funny room.

474
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,080
What do you mean by funny room?

475
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,620
You'll see.

476
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
It's weird.

477
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,640
Oh, is Johnny a little freaky?

478
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,680
It's the cannibalism room.

479
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,040
We need to get the keys, though.

480
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,840
The old man hid it inside a book in the study.

481
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,840
What's the study?

482
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,880
Is this the study?

483
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,050
This is the book room.

484
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,010
Definitely the dungeon.

485
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,170
Oh, my God.

486
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,670
Johnny's freaky.

487
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,770
Happy coming, Oshite.

488
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,050
Thank you.

489
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,050
The key to the funny room is in the thickest book on the upper shelf.

490
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,890
I want to read his diary.

491
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,490
Tommy used to throw books at me and call it a book fight.

492
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,450
Until one day I threw one back and he needed a band-aid.

493
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,710
Just a bunch of books in here.

494
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,470
They've nothing I don't know.

495
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,810
They've nothing I don't know about, though.

496
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,570
Okay.

497
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,070
Tommy

498
00:36:34,960 --> 00:37:03,080
The emperor's new clothes Oh that's the one where the guy's like actually naked What's the accent we're going for with this family I don't know Dusk light The tale of a girl who fell in love with a zombie Who emitted the smell of daisies When showered with gentle sunlight Oh my gosh wait it's twilight Oh Oh my god!

499
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,160
I want to read.

500
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,020
Uh, maybe another year.

501
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:08,880
What?

502
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,120
He chose its hiding spot well.

503
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,560
Wait, that's so messed up!

504
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,840
No, please!

505
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,700
We could still read the emperor's new clothes.

506
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,760
And the colors!

507
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,720
The colors of that beautiful fabric!

508
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,740
I have never seen anything like it in my life!

509
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,680
They all tried to conceal their disappointment at not being able to see the clothes.

510
00:37:30,020 --> 00:38:01,880
A child, however, who had no important role and could only see things as the eyes showed them to him went up to the carriage but he hasn't got anything on the child says don't talk nonsense his father reprimanded with the boy's remark which has been heard by the bystanders was repeated over and over such a silly story oh my eyes turn it off turn it off Wait,

511
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,320
if I turn it on...

512
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,980
Okay, no, it doesn't make it so that I can, like, read it.

513
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
We can open the funny room in the basement now!

514
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,580
Okay.

515
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,600
This is the basement.

516
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,380
We play hide and seek in here.

517
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,220
Turn on the light before you trip over something.

518
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,880
Is this kid, like, got a...

519
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,520
Like a...

520
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,880
Like a...

521
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,200
What's the word?

522
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,580
Southern accent?

523
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,040
Before you trip over something.

524
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,440
is locked uh

525
00:38:37,730 --> 00:39:08,510
oh oh no no that's not what i meant to do please okay the perspective is my downfall it's my greatest it will bring me to ruin the cabinet is filled with unused fine china boxes filled with colored papers chest is locked okay oh my gosh i just Let's get close to the stairs and it brings me up.

526
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:17,310
I think it might be better for me to point and click to move than use the arrow keys.

527
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,650
Dusty pile of anamorphs books.

528
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,550
Okay, Johnny, I was not familiar with your game.

529
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,650
Open door with the room key.

530
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,880
It's like a cave in here.

531
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,920
This isn't a...

532
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,940
A horror game?

533
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,880
A broken music box.

534
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,020
A stuffed toy platypus.

535
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,740
It looks adorable enough to annoy Neil.

536
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,940
Might come in handy.

537
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,380
Poke it.

538
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:03,800
Oh!

539
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,140
Wait, what just happened?

540
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,440
Set it up?

541
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,720
If we take anything, is he gonna...

542
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,860
Well, the guy is dying.

543
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,220
I guess he wouldn't know.

544
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,740
But can I...

545
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,000
Maybe I have to take it.

546
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,440
I can't...

547
00:40:20,080 --> 00:41:22,420

Fine.

552
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,180
Maybe it'll tell me more about those rabbits.

553
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,380
Let's go check out that old lighthouse out.

554
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,560
Her partner.

555
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,920
Oh, it's Wads.

556
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,800
It's Dr. Wads.

557
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,880
Neil Wads.

558
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,890
Why is the music so scary all of a sudden?

559
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,710
Whoa, whoa, gosh.

560
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,450
We go outside.

561
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:53,390
zooming.

562
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,150
Meow, meow.

563
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,660
Wait, how do I get there?

564
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,980
There it is!

565
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,320
We need to head south to the street and take the other path to get down to it though.

566
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,340
Yeah, I forgot my parachute.

567
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,880
We're zooming, we're zooming.

568
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,640
And you'll see Sierra go, so true.

569
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,000
Wait, we have to go all the way back to the street?

570
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,390
Sorry, I'm constantly adjusting the music volume.

571
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,330
So if it gets a little loud, just let me know.

572
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:39,730
Or anything.

573
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,350
Oh.

574
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,710
It's here!

575
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,050
Huh?

576
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,630
My novelty beach ball!

577
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,490
I thought I lost it.

578
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,570
Ah.

579
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,410
It's stupid anyway.

580
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,070
Oh, I'll never lose it again!

581
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,350
I'm gonna hide it.

582
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:58,930
Don't look.

583
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,730
Oh.

584
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,270
Okay, done.

585
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,010
Okay, let's just hurry to that lighthouse.

586
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:11,810
It's smoking.

587
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,490
Who's the dummy that crashed the car?

588
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,100
Why does he talk?

589
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,120
Who's the dummy that crashed the car?

590
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,920
I can't get over Tommy's accent.

591
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,060

Oh my gosh.

595
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:37,380
I think I'm gonna be struggling with these, with the, with the walking this entire time.

596
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:38,280
A squirrel!

597
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,820
Wait, did she just call it a squirrel?

598
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,920
Just like me?

599
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,040
Oh no, it's a terrible squirrel gone.

600
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,040
What the heck is...

601
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,100
Oh.

602
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,720
Oh my gosh.

603
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh my god!

604
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,440
Don't worry children, I'll protect you!

605
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,260
What?

606
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,940
Even they're confused.

607
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,680
Oh my gosh!

608
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,780
Attack.

609
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,800
With a shoe.

610
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,680
Yelling volume loudest.

611
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,420
Your time is at an end.

612
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,560
Squirrel gone.

613
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,620
Yeah, stop it!

614
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,720
We tell Ma you, animal abuse.

615
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,240
I think these kids have southern accents.

616
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,120
Yeah.

617
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,100
She'll call the cops on you.

618
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,460
What?

619
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,560
I was just...

620
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,380
I wasn't gonna...

621
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,880
Didn't you say you liked roleplay?

622
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,170
Did I mess up the battle?

623
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,090
You should have been ashamed of yourself.

624
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,390
Why did these kids, like, regress?

625
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,910
to caveman speak.

626
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,370
Sometimes they talk so properly and then they become this.

627
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,830
Let's name it Teddy.

628
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,110
Let's just forget this happened.

629
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,050
What did just happen?

630
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,090
I would like an explanation, please.

631
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,310
I would like some sort of...

632
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,310
like some sort of reason why that occurred.

633
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:43,970
Oh, abandon...

634
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,310
Gosh, there's probably so many ghosts in there.

635
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,100
What is this?

636
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,400
In memory of River E.

637
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,020
Wiles.

638
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,700
Wait, the song was called For River.

639
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,200
River Wiles.

640
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,180
Was she John's wife?

641
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,440
I don't know.

642
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,180
Come on, the lighthouse is right there!

643
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, That one's special though.

644
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,420
This is it!

645
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,910
Seems like this hasn't been lit in years.

646
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,790
A multicolored paper rabbit.

647
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,410
Hey, this wasn't here when we came last week.

648
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:55,670
Oh yeah, Johnny must have came here before he fell ill again.

649
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,230
This is the only one with two colors, huh?

650
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,350
You know, these things actually look pretty hard to fold.

651
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,510
Kind of an odd hobby, though.

652
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,630
Oh, that's my phone.

653
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,350
It's Watts.

654
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,010
Is everything ready?

655
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,730
All right.

656
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,310
I'll be right there.

657
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,630
Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing.

658
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,150
Where is ringtone?

659
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,730
Why do you have a creepy ringtone?

660
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,330
the monsters away.

661
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:33,670
Come on, let's head back.

662
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:36,970
Received paper rabbit.

663
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,470
Are we just taking it?

664
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:38,830
Okay.

665
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:40,930
We stole.

666
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,170
We keep stealing.

667
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,190
We can't stop stealing.

668
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:47,330
What the heck?

669
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,410
They put a melon on his head.

670
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,050
Oh, why don't you be late by another half an hour?

671
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,290
Not like we got a dying client or anything.

672
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,470
Dorgo, thank you!

673
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:02,370
Good job.

674
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,230
Did that work?

675
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,430
Ah, thank you for the 50 years.

676
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:06,050
Thank you.

677
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,050
Oh my gosh.

678
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:07,450
Thank you.

679
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:07,870
Thank you.

680
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,100
It's not a melon.

681
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,020
It's a science melon.

682
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,540
I got caught up in something.

683
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,660
I got caught up in something, too.

684
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,920
It's called our job.

685
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,760
Get off your high horse.

686
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,460
I'm late.

687
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,440
Just this one time and you milk it.

688
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,820
Jed, no, thank you.

689
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,240
At least tell me we're good to go.

690
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,440
Of course we are.

691
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,720
because I'm competent.

692
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,980
Oh my gosh.

693
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,480
Your helmet's on the couch.

694
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,340
Chop, chop.

695
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,780
Oh, here.

696
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,820
Initiate?

697
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,660
Wait, not yet.

698
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,640
What's going on?

699
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,520
What's going on?

700
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:49,960
Okay.

701
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,700
What do you have to say?

702
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:53,520
Go on.

703
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,200
I'll watch over his physical conditions through the procedure.

704
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,720
By the way, I'm curious.

705
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:00,880
How does it work?

706
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,080
Do you just write him another life Like a novel?

707
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,100
No, we can't just make up new memories out of thin air.

708
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,240
Then, how do you do it?

709
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,920
Not us.

710
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,280
The machine does most of it.

711
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,900
Oh my gosh, the chat is like all so and so getting gifted.

712
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,940
Thank you guys, thank you.

713
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:29,980
Naturally, since we aren't paid enough to get our hands dirty, in a nutshell, we simply travel through his memories to as early as possible.

714
00:50:30,580 --> 00:51:00,520
When we do, transfer his registered desire of going to the moon to the reconstruction of the world and himself with the early state and with the help of a wiki of data in his own the machine would then simulate a rerun except this time he'll have the motivation of his of his registered desire with him all his life so you'd be depending on him fulfilling his own wish by simply having the desire to how could that be?

715
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,220
Everyone has ambition for things, but most don't accomplish them.

716
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,560
That's because in the real world, ambitions fluctuate and fade.

717
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,500
People start things with a passion, but eventually they lose that initial drive and slow down.

718
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:22,100
But imagine if you locked onto that initial push through your entire life, never wavering.

719
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,340
It's more powerful than it seems.

720
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:52,020
That being said, no ambition is better go get started oh of course sorry freaky it's kind of freaky they like use your old memories to like push this false idea on you paperback thank you

721
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,560
it's in it's it's kind of strange

722
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,100
All right, here we go.

723
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,320
Hello, I am Dr. Rosaline, and I'm going to take you to the moon, little child.

724
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,860
Whoa, whoa!

725
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:36,690
Oh, this should be the last accessible memory.

726
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,250
Whoa.

727
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,950
Disable speech for all except Johnny.

728
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:42,350
Done.

729
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,370
Let's get him.

730
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,580
Oh, I get to see you.

731
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,570
Oh, this is kind of weird, though.

732
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,310
My mouse has to go to, like, the top of my screen.

733
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,630
I hope that doesn't make it weird later.

734
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:10,850
Oh, whoops.

735
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:15,850
Johnny.

736
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:17,570
Johnny.

737
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:19,930
Johnny.

738
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:21,770
Johnny.

739
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:21,930
Johnny.

740
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,250
Are you downstairs?

741
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:23,890
No.

742
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:24,570
Johnny?

743
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,410
Happy Oshida Mickey!

744
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,150
Oh my gosh!

745
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,150
Happy birthday!

746
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,290
Happy Oshida!

747
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,690
I was on autopilot.

748
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,050
Thank you!

749
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,830
Ward and happy birthday.

750
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,630
Johnny?

751
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:52,990
Oh.

752
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,490
Johnny's old man.

753
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,350
What a pleasant surprise.

754
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,590
We don't get many visitors around here.

755
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,870
My name is Dr. Eva Rosaline.

756
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,810
And this is Dr. Von Matterhorn.

757
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,590
Dr. Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

758
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:14,990
Is Papa?

759
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,110
Eating candy?

760
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:19,670
No, Papa.

761
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,110
Then open your mouth.

762
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,730
Eating candy cane?

763
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,130
Dr. Neil Watts.

764
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:34,130
Are you familiar with the Sikman Agency of Life Generation?

765
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,670
Oh, are you two from the agency?

766
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:39,330
How convenient.

767
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,910
I've just been thinking of calling you.

768
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,110
Lily, get us some tea, please.

769
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:48,430
Lily?

770
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,070
Actually, you've already called us.

771
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,810
Wait, this is so messed up!

772
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,250
So he's gonna know?

773
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:57,650
Oh!

774
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,870
We're here to fulfill our contract from the relative future.

775
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:08,770
Careful there.

776
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,110
If you slip off the cliff, we're gonna have to reload this memory.

777
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:13,770
Watch it, Neil.

778
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:14,790
Show some respect.

779
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,030
It's just a program, you know.

780
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:22,570
I know, but this is his last accessible memory and we need its cooperation.

781
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,230
First comes to worst, we can just reboot it.

782
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,470
Why would you waste time like that?

783
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:29,110
You...

784
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,550
You...

785
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:32,390
Me?

786
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,010
Oh, Naga.

787
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,240
You are here to take me to the moon, aren't you?

788
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,080
Oh my gosh.

789
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,240
Sorry.

790
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:55,550
Yes, John.

791
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,030
Johnny.

792
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:57,970
Call me Johnny.

793
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,990
I suppose I had a good run.

794
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,190
Not good enough, it seems.

795
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,370
I'm going to push this guy off of the...

796
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,870
live and hope that he dies in real life.

797
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,450
So, can you do it?

798
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,190
Can you take me to the moon?

799
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:23,190
We can't, but you might be able to.

800
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,950
Why do you want to go there?

801
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:28,890
I don't know.

802
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,030
Huh?

803
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,130
It's fine.

804
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,190
You can tell us.

805
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,370
It's essential for helping us to get you to go there.

806
00:56:37,390 --> 00:57:10,230
do you want the fame the money you've got to have a motive i'm sorry but i really don't know i just do he saw it on tv yeah i can already tell that this is going to be a pain in the ass it's your job neil nevertheless johnny here's what we will do we need to get to your child but it is too distant to do so in one memory hop.

807
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:18,190
Thus, we will need to traverse through your memories with gradual backward leaps, which you have given us permission to do in the relative future.

808
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,960
Once we lay down the waypoints in your childhood memories for direct access, we will return here.

809
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,600
That's when you'll need to help us influence the childhood you to become an astronaut.

810
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,340
Change your career trajectory.

811
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,160
Join the space program.

812
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:45,340
Oh my gosh, we're going to send little Johnny to...

813
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,800
We're going to send little Johnny to space camp.

814
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,460
Or get on a giant catapult.

815
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,460
The point is, you'll need to have more than...

816
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,620
Just...

817
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,480
More...

818
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,640
Wait, you'll need to have more to say than just, I don't know.

819
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,200
As long as you can take me to the moon, I will cooperate in any way possible.

820
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,160
Good.

821
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,300
I wanted to go to space camp.

822
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,700
It was so bad when I was a kid.

823
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,200
Now, in order to leap to a memory, we need an item that is of importance, Sayo.

824
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,500
Do you have a memento of some sort to get us started?

825
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:34,670
That'll do.

826
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:36,830
That'll do, don't you?

827
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:37,910
That'll do.

828
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,730
Well, shall we?

829
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,350
Ladies first.

830
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,830
A mintmento of...

831
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,830
a momento, if you would.

832
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,070
Received note.

833
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,370
We'll need to prepare this momento first.

834
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

835
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,010
Complete the momento.

836
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,470
Click the orbs to flip the pieces.

837
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:13,720
Whoa.

838
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,280
Oh.

839
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,020
Whoa.

840
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,540
Memento.

841
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,480
The Memento can now be activated for traversal.

842
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,360
Activate?

843
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,080
Wait.

844
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,160
Does he have anything else to say?

845
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:33,560
No?

846
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,620
To the past!

847
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,100
Wait, what about my privacy?

848
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,280
Well, try not to violate what we can avoid.

849
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,660
But in most cases, it can't be held.

850
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,580
I think you should have thought about that before you ask them to go through your memory.

851
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:10,900
I think you should have Did they not Talk about that in like the orientation The terms and conditions Johnny did you read them But in most cases it can't be helped

852
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:24,200
Oh whoa Oh Oh grief is so so strange.

853
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:24,820
Wait.

854
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,150
Turn off visibility and interactivity.

855
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,090
It'd be messy to be seen.

856
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:44,610
Yeah, yeah.

857
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:45,090
Happy?

858
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:50,150
Why do you have to be as smart as smarty pants about everything?

859
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,310
Thank you, Fokuro!

860
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,510
You're okay, I guess.

861
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:00,250
Jeez, what's with all these rabbits?

862
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:31,830
This is creeping me out we probably should have checked his record for psychopathy first did he hear me that's impossible it's probably just a part of his memory oh then i stand by my point anyway quick blabbering and find a memento here to hop from

863
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:42,240
interact with objects to establish five memory links This clock is moving, but soundless.

864
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,860
Okay, we got the clock.

865
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,220
This is so interesting.

866
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,940
Happy Ochi Day, Vito.

867
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:49,680
Thank you!

868
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,520
Wait, what is this?

869
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,040
Requires memory links to shoot, okay?

870
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,900
We're shooting the umbrella.

871
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,400
Okay, platypus is no goal.

872
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:01,720
Does this count?

873
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,280
Multicolored favorite rabbit.

874
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,540
Aren't you special having two colors when all your siblings look like they drowned in bleach?

875
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,760
Happy Yoshi Day!

876
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:10,680
Thank you!

877
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,660
What's that?

878
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,920
You think you're really creepy?

879
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,320
Why, yes, I agree!

880
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,100
Okay, that does count.

881
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,500
Uh, we can go upstairs.

882
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,840
Corvia, thank you so much for the...

883
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,440
for the... for the dono, thank you!

884
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,600
Oh, whoa, whoa!

885
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,620
An old and patched up backpack.

886
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:39,840
What is this?

887
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,900
A million years old?

888
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,580
I guess we'll find out.

889
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,800
Does that not count?

890
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:45,840
Okay, what's this?

891
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,360
A glass bottle of pickled olives.

892
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,220
I don't like olives.

893
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,500
Do you guys like olives?

894
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:56,980
I hate this stuff.

895
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,180
What's it hate?

896
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,320
It's pickled olive.

897
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,080
Not really.

898
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,200
Olives are great.

899
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:05,840
I just...

900
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,360
I can't get into them.

901
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,040
Happy Yoshi Deminto.

902
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,440
Thank you so much!

903
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,440
Okay, olives count.

904
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,100
Don't.

905
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,340
If we have to explain our presence to him at every memory, I'd go crazy.

906
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,140
Don't tempt me.

907
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:27,760
Okay.

908
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:30,800
Um...

909
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,140
Is there anything else that you guys saw?

910
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:37,660
Pew!

911
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,000
Pew!

912
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,620
I think I need two more things.

913
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,810
That acidity, the saltiness, the juiciness, perfection.

914
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:50,890
I see.

915
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,330
I can't go in here.

916
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,470
Can I go outside?

917
01:03:56,270 --> 01:04:03,530
How can you hate a food that when you say it sounds, say it fast sounds like I love.

918
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:12,930
Olive, olive, olive, olive, olive, olive, olive, olive, olive, olive, olive.

919
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:24,480
I missed one upstairs.

920
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,440
Okay, thank you.

921
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,320
Oh.

922
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,200
Yep.

923
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,040
Oh, there it is.

924
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,020
The emperor's new clothes.

925
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:37,540
Okay.

926
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,280
Apparently he really likes that book.

927
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:40,740
Oh, here.

928
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,520
A selection of readings for medical journals.

929
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,200
Sounds more like Olive.

930
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,460
Yeah, there was a movie about that.

931
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,680
Do you guys remember Olive, the other reindeer?

932
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:53,820
Oh, here.

933
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,340
Fresh wildflowers.

934
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,380
Okay, I got them.

935
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,420
Do you guys remember Olive the other reindeer?

936
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,080
That was like a, it was a movie about a dog.

937
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,040
His name was Olive.

938
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:23,420
And he thought that when the song, or when Santa was talking about all of the other reindeers in the song, you know, all of the other reindeer, then that Santa was actually talking about him, the dog.

939
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:29,060
Olive is a girl.

940
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:29,780
Oh, my bad.

941
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,740
It's been a really long time since I've seen that movie.

942
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:35,720
It's so dumb.

943
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,040
It really is.

944
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,240
It's so...

945
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,740
It's like cute and stupid at the same time.

946
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,580
Pew!

947
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:44,820
Pew!

948
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,020
How do I get?

949
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:49,760
What the...

950
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,340
Wait.

951
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,360
I thought I had.

952
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:02,160
I thought I had a beep

953
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,740
I don't Sorry I just had people cheering

954
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:42,600
What the Oh frog button sorry What the What's that This game is like being an RPGM without HD Stop don't say that What That's it I'm doing the braking from now on.

955
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,600
Alright, let's travel back!

956
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:52,240
Oh.

957
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,180
Reminder, the corner orb can flip the entire diagonal.

958
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,900
Sounds like you want me to do that.

959
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,540
Oh wait.

960
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,480
I think I had it.

961
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:04,920
My bad.

962
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,640
With the ding dong!

963
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,060
Activate the momento.

964
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:13,800
Wait.

965
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,060
Can I talk to him?

966
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:15,680
No?

967
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,540
Peepoo peep up.

968
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,300
Aww.

969
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,180
This is so sad.

970
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,540
When it comes to rain, through is better than on too.

971
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,380
I don't mind it regardless.

972
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,660
Seems like these memory hops only span a short period of time.

973
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,980
find a leaping memento, or it's going to take forever.

974
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,780
Just enjoy the scenery.

975
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,020
In memory of River E.

976
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:01,800
Wiles.

977
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,580
Stuffed toy platypus.

978
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,140
Honestly, oh, why did that door just open?

979
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,940
I don't think this animal has the right to exist.

980
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,500
A shot!

981
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,300
Nobody asked for your opinion, Neil.

982
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,100
The world's not big enough for two of you.

983
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,060
Okay, I think we gotta go in here.

984
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,660
What's wrong with the platypus?

985
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,980
It's finished, River.

986
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:37,600
Like you, I'll be able to watch over her every day.

987
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,740
She won't be alone anymore.

988
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:47,950
Did they have like a daughter?

989
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,890
I might never understand why, but I stayed true to your wish.

990
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,830
I'm sure Anya is grateful to you too.

991
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,030
But when I'm gone,

992
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,780
Who is going to watch over us?

993
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,000
Platypus has a right to exist, exactly.

994
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,400
Who are you?

995
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,980
My name is Eva.

996
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,220
Eva?

997
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,340
I was just passing by.

998
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,740
Was she your wife?

999
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:35,880
Yes.

1000
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,460
Her name was River.

1001
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:37,680
her.

1002
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,840
That's a special name.

1003
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,800
It didn't need to happen.

1004
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,080
She... She didn't need to do it.

1005
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:59,180
But she... You wouldn't understand.

1006
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,360
I don't even understand.

1007
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,080
What?

1008
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,740
He didn't say lolly loo, you guys.

1009
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,420
He's not Adam.

1010
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,780
He's Johnny.

1011
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,970
Let the guy grieve in peace.

1012
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,110
Thanks for the clarification.

1013
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:32,250
Of course I got you.

1014
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,250
Received note.

1015
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:39,970
Anya.

1016
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,250
It's about time you got here.

1017
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:54,810
I almost thought you fell off the cliff.

1018
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:56,470
What were you doing?

1019
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:58,570
Enjoying the scenery.

1020
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,370
What else?

1021
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,830
Any luck here?

1022
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:20,190

1025
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:19,570
This place looks pretty empty.

1026
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:21,490
It's a lighthouse.

1027
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:22,650
What do you expect?

1028
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,390
Anyway, I'll catch you on the other side.

1029
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:28,870
Have fun re-breaking the barrier for yourself.

1030
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:31,150
Is it okay?

1031
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:33,690
Oh!

1032
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,570
Wait, what does this do?

1033
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,350
A broken lighthouse lamp.

1034
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,580
Is it okay?

1035
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,260
Oh.

1036
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,100
Old man.

1037
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:50,980
Ah.

1038
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,080
Ha-ya!

1039
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,440
Ha-ya!

1040
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:54,620
Ha-ya!

1041
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:01,980
Oh.

1042
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:08,740
Ideal shows the minimum number of moves the Memento can be completed in.

1043
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:09,800
What the heck?

1044
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:11,560
Okay.

1045
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,980
Why is this like a...

1046
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,860
Oh, I think I got it wrong already.

1047
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,460
The ideal is three.

1048
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,240
like par now?

1049
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,780
I did it in four.

1050
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,000
I suck.

1051
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,880
Oh, man.

1052
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:32,860
Activate.

1053
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,400
Skill check.

1054
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:37,900
The bogey.

1055
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,020
Whoa.

1056
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,600
Oh, he's young.

1057
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,900
And all the rabbits are everywhere.

1058
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,600
Do you guys hear the heartbeat?

1059
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,940
Just enough.

1060
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:19,940
after we pay for your operation we'll have just enough left for for it so don't you worry white lie that's what you call it right no I'm sure we could just stop it

1061
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:55,960
I don't like it when you lie I calculated our finances I know how it's like why do you try to convince me against my will we need the money for your medical bills river I understand that Anya means a lot to you but this this is just too much I mean she she isn't even you know what makes me happy Johnny well

1063
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:16,560
River.

1064
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:24,780
When the papers for my treatments get here, I will not sign them.

1065
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:25,700
No!

1066
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,120
What you do with our money is up to you.

1067
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:36,800
But if you would grant my wish, I want you to use it to finish building that house.

1068
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:43,520
And then, for every day that you live there, I want you to watch over her.

1069
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,780
Visit her, speak to her, comfort her.

1070
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,960
Is Anya the platypus?

1071
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,380
I don't want her to be alone anymore.

1072
01:15:58,820 --> 01:15:59,660
And what about you?

1073
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,440
I'll be happy.

1074
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:13,200
Johnny?

1075
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,260
Yes.

1076
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,580
I made this.

1077
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,720
Oh, it's the special one.

1078
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,420
What?

1079
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,140
Just tell me what it is.

1080
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:29,740
It's a bunny.

1081
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:31,280
It's a rabbit.

1082
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,800
Like all the others you made.

1083
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,600
You guys are all crying.

1084
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:36,700
Are you okay?

1085
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,180
What else?

1086
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,500
Um, it's made of paper.

1087
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:45,800
What else?

1088
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,480
Its body is yellow and the rest is blue.

1089
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,510
Be depressed for another week.

1090
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:58,910
It's okay, you'll be okay.

1091
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:00,330
Good.

1092
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:01,550
What else?

1093
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:05,810
Look, River...

1094
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,330
I wrote a song.

1095
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:10,690
It's for you.

1096
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,310
Okay.

1097
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,800
Well, would you like to hear it?

1098
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:22,820
Yes.

1099
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,140
You didn't have to bring the piano in here for this.

1100
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:31,860
Okay.

1101
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,540
I can hear you just fine with the door open.

1102
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,000
It's called Four River.

1103
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,580
Why so cliche?

1104
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,080
It's just a placeholder.

1105
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,360
Aw, but it wasn't.

1106
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,520
Who is this Anya they were talking about?

1107
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,220
If she's so important, shouldn't we have seen her in his late memories?

1108
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,680
I guess he didn't keep that promise after.

1109
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:29,840
all unless unless what hey

1110
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:38,400
that's the same song the kids were playing earlier huh i guess he taught them

1111
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:56,060
you know what i'm too manly for this i'm heading on i've already got my memory links you want to hitch a quick ride or look around yourself we'll explore yeah go on ahead on catch up with you.

1112
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:05,040
No, you missed the days when memory audio to MP8 conversion was legal.

1113
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,920
Vivi Koi, thank you so much for that gift, dude.

1114
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:16,780
Yeah, Neil is leaving because he's gonna start crying his little baby eyes out.

1115
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,520
MP8.

1116
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:24,140
I think I brought home over 2,000 songs during my first year on this job.

1117
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,120
Okay, so this This is the...

1118
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:29,180
Okay.

1119
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,480
We got the little plat...

1120
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:32,840
Oh, nope.

1121
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:35,140
The emperor's new clothes once again.

1122
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,260
A paper rabbit.

1123
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,280
The four river.

1124
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:56,320
Downstairs.

1125
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:57,800
Oh!

1126
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,140
Oh, is this them bringing up the...

1127
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,000
We got some mixed dough.

1128
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,600
And we got the olives.

1129
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,800
Someone really likes these.

1130
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:07,660
Who is this?

1131
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,680
Nicholas, I'm telling you, there's just no way.

1132
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:13,760
What if we take it apart?

1133
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,400
Look at us, John.

1134
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,340
We aren't exactly at the ripe age of piano moving.

1135
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,240
You can read the note.

1136
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:20,920
Wait, how?

1137
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:26,950
You know what?

1138
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:31,130
If this means that much to you, I'll pay for the professionals to do it.

1139
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:32,490
In the menu.

1140
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:37,230
I can't help saving that house for you, so this is the least I can do.

1141
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,290
Oh, press escape.

1142
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:42,910
The

1143
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:48,620
moon and Johnny's memory is full.

1144
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:14,990
To the past!

1145
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,590
Prepare the memento.

1146
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,390
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1147
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:29,410
Peep, beep, beep, beep.

1148
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,250
Ideal is four.

1149
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,610
Uh, I think I'm not good at this game.

1150
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:38,490
Let's see.

1151
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:40,910
I'm just not going to worry about it, I think.

1152
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,050
Does it...

1153
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:43,890
Oh, see, I didn't even notice.

1154
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:45,670
It's fine.

1155
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:46,230
Wait.

1156
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,430
Am I stupid?

1157
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:49,750
Why can't...

1158
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,110
At least it's not Sudoku.

1159
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,530
Oh, no, wait.

1160
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:57,290
Oh, gosh.

1161
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:58,130
These are tricky.

1162
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,230
Oh, wait.

1163
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:03,070
This doesn't, like, affect an ending, does it?

1164
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:08,350
VTuber, you need to do the puzzle in three seconds.

1165
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,170
Oh, gosh.

1166
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:10,710
Oh, the pressure.

1167
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:14,650
It doesn't?

1168
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:15,410
Okay, good.

1169
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,490
I was going to say.

1170
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:21,090
It's just your pride.

1171
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:22,410
Yeah.

1172
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,230
Is this a corner?

1173
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:25,870
No.

1174
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:29,830
It's my pride.

1175
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:30,730
Wait.

1176
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,670
I think I am stupid, though.

1177
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:36,410
How are you supposed to get these?

1178
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,690
I've never been good with these types of puzzles.

1179
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,190
How are you supposed to get it?

1180
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:47,430
I had it?

1181
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:47,810
I did?

1182
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:50,810
I'm stupid.

1183
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,050
No, I'm stupid.

1184
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,850
The ideal is four.

1185
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:01,030
The ideal is four.

1186
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:04,450
And I have it at...

1187
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:04,610
Okay.

1188
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:04,910
Okay.

1189
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:09,850
Oh my gosh.

1190
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,010
How do I reset it?

1191
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:14,490
I actually don't know if I even can.

1192
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:15,870
I would like to.

1193
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:16,450
Wait, can I?

1194
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:18,230
Oh, exit game.

1195
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:20,190
Oh, wait, that exited the whole game.

1196
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:32,720
My bad.

1197
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:38,360
Oh, again?

1198
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,220
Please say psych right now.

1199
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,100
Say psych right now.

1200
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,220
Oh, say psych right now.

1201
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,540
Uh-oh.

1202
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,980
Uh-oh.

1203
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,460
El Tigre!

1204
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,420
Thank you!

1205
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,720
Thank you so much for the pink.

1206
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:00,340
Wait.

1207
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,600
What auto-save?

1208
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:08,280
Oh!

1209
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,680
Okay, we're...

1210
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,600
Everybody, we're fine.

1211
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,260
Save the game.

1212
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,640
Save the game.

1213
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,520
Guys, we were lucky duckies.

1214
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,620
I did, I did.

1215
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,400
We're all good now.

1216
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:36,980
We're all good.

1217
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,040
Okay, hold on.

1218
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,100
Ideal is four?

1219
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,570
You worked out so bad.

1220
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:56,230
Hint diagonal.

1221
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,780
You need a diagonal, I do.

1222
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,800
Oh, I see it.

1223
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,040
Thank you guys.

1224
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,280
We got that!

1225
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,700
We got the ideal!

1226
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,040
Yippee!

1227
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,360
Diagonal, Vituper Diagonal!

1228
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,000
First try.

1229
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,500
I totally didn't rage quit the first time.

1230
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:39,000
I thought it meant to like exit the minigame, but it just meant the entire thing.

1231
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,140
Finally.

1232
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:44,460
Okay.

1233
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:45,860
Uh.

1234
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:48,260
Uh.

1235
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:50,460
Oh.

1236
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,580
Oh, we're just hopping.

1237
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,280
Whoa, whoa.

1238
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:52,680
We're hopping.

1239
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:55,300
Heh.

1240
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,140
Look what we have here.

1241
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,260
Now, Ed, thank you so much for the video.

1242
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,060
Thank you.

1243
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,280
Yeah, I did exit the minigame.

1244
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,800
They're building the house.

1245
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,100
They're forever home.

1246
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:14,140
I bet they saw this cliff and thought it was not dating.

1247
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,640
dangerous enough without people living on it.

1248
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:21,950
Oh, he looks tired.

1249
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:23,590
Are you okay, Papa?

1250
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,080
Isabel.

1251
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,680
Nick called and said I should come.

1252
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,460
I brought you pickled olives.

1253
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:49,960
They're your favorite, right?

1254
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,020
We should just put some on the ground.

1255
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:56,980
I heard about river.

1256
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,400
be okay.

1257
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,920
Our illness was just diagnosed in its late stage.

1258
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,660
Fortunately, it's treatable.

1259
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,740
But the medical bills...

1260
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,900
We can't afford to finish building this house, Isabel.

1261
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:21,800
Give me one second.

1262
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:22,940
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1263
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,240
I thought the music would keep going.

1264
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,400
Uh...

1265
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:28,020
There we go.

1266
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,120
I realized.

1267
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:29,940
Uh...

1268
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,700
There we go.

1269
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,060
I can't afford to finish building this house, Isabel.

1270
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:39,160
Well, I can barely afford to pay for her treatment.

1271
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:46,260
I'm just relieved that she'll be okay, but...

1272
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,080
You don't know how much this place means to her.

1273
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,480
She's going to be heartbroken.

1274
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,760
I'd help, but Ted and I have been barely getting by since the market crashed.

1275
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,880
Oh, no!

1276
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,780
What are you going to do?

1277
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,520
do now.

1278
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:19,740
I'm going to tell her that we can make it.

1279
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,520
I'm going to tell her that we can afford everything.

1280
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,860
I don't want her to do anything crazy.

1281
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,300
You shouldn't lie to her.

1282
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,780
You don't understand, Isabel.

1283
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:34,380
If she found out, I'm not sure which she'd choose.

1284
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,340
So what?

1285
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:41,220
If she chooses not to save herself for the sake of this place, then so be it.

1286
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,260
Oh my Oh my gosh!

1287
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:43,640
Somebody...

1288
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,060
What?

1289
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,400
Poor Johnny!

1290
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,760
Oh my gosh!

1291
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,860
Crypto stalks, no!

1292
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,160
That's what she really wants.

1293
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,720
So what?

1294
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:04,500
I really dislike when you neurotypicals think you know what's best for others.

1295
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,300
I hate when you call me that, Izzy.

1296
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:08,140
Huh?

1297
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,600
Do you think this is all about her?

1298
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,780
What about me, Isabel?

1299
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,380
After all these years, am I not allowed to be selfish even once?

1300
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:29,040
I don't want to be alone, Isabel.

1301
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:29,720
Aww.

1302
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,860
I'm not going to let her die.

1303
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:34,880
That's arrogant.

1304
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,360
What is this?

1305
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:42,840
It's not like they're pulling the plug on her.

1306
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:44,040
It's treatable, no?

1307
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:52,860
like am I am I taking crazy pills huh

1308
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:16,390
why are they so mean to him I don't care where are you going I'm going to pick something from this cliff to bring back to her it'll at least give her some comfort it'll make sense later?

1309
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:17,270
Okay, okay.

1310
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:18,810
Right now I'm like, what?

1311
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:23,570
That doesn't make what you're doing any less wrong.

1312
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:28,590
Nick wanted me to give you this.

1313
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,190
He said it's called Everything's Alright.

1314
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,950
It isn't.

1315
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:44,610
It's a complicated situation.

1316
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,170
Neither of them are fully in the wrong IMO.

1317
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:50,350
That can be one of those kinds of situations, I guess.

1318
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,880
olive oh okay the olives are the thing

1319
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:12,900
what else we got around here oh the truck the whole truck okay

1320
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:29,080
anything down here nope a rope no oh i'm stuck on a tree okay Hmm.

1321
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,280
Inside the house maybe?

1322
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,200
Memory links may be acquired from exploration.

1323
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,420
Oh, interesting.

1324
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,660
Why music box make me so emoy?

1325
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,120
Emo sugiro!

1326
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:50,380
Too emotional.

1327
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:56,720
Oh, we got the rest?

1328
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:12,350
Uh...

1329
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:13,470
Come here, olives.

1330
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:15,770
Hiya!

1331
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,430
Hiya!

1332
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:17,350
Hiya!

1333
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:18,510
Hiya!

1334
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,620
Step twice in the river.

1335
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,240
I missed what it said.

1336
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,000
I wonder if there- is there like things in here?

1337
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,380
I kind of...

1338
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,980
Wait, what's the- what's the difference?

1339
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,560
Oh, okay okay okay.

1340
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:45,740
Oh!

1341
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:49,500
Huh?

1342
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:51,540
Does it- what color does it need to be?

1343
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,540
Wait, I'm confused.

1344
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,180
Well, I think I got it.

1345
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:06,950
Pickled olives.

1346
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:08,310
Activate.

1347
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:10,730
Kind of makes me hungry.

1348
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:11,990
A little bit.

1349
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,000
Oh, pizza.

1350
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,160
Oh, it's ours.

1351
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:27,160
So you guys are really going for it, huh?

1352
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,180
It's been a while since I've been able to say hello.

1353
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:30,720
So hello.

1354
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:31,560
Hello.

1355
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,260
Thank you, golden pizza.

1356
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,320
Thank you.

1357
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,580
But I don't like olives.

1358
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:40,920
Yeah.

1359
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:46,320
Yep.

1360
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,680
The construction's starting in just a few months.

1361
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,260
It's a bit of a squeeze.

1362
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:51,660
We had to split the payment.

1363
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,120
But with financing, we'll make do.

1364
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:56,440
How wonderful.

1365
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,180
Having your dream house built at such a beautiful site.

1366
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:05,140
You had your wedding at that lighthouse near there all those years ago, didn't you?

1367
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:06,060
Aw, it's nice.

1368
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,560
special place.

1369
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,600
Oh, that's not all that's special about it.

1370
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:09,920
Oh.

1371
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,600
Just kidding.

1372
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:19,260
We have a long history with that place.

1373
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,320
Oh, it is their special place.

1374
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,240
Well, it's good to have some good news at a get-together for once.

1375
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,920
Cheers and congratulations, you two.

1376
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:28,940
Hey, cheers.

1377
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,480
Cheers!

1378
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,660
And the pickles and the olives.

1379
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,400
Be right back.

1380
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,540
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

1381
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,240
It is special.

1382
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,520
It's their special place.

1383
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,820
Well, buddy, it's sure...

1384
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,040
It's sure been a while.

1385
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,460
Hasn't it?

1386
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,680
Who knew how hard it is to get across a few cities nowadays?

1387
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:57,240
That river.

1388
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:58,760
Still so quiet, huh?

1389
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,740
Eh, she's actually been talkative at home.

1390
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:02,800
I'm with Isabel.

1391
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:05,060
I guess she's just not used to you.

1392
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,600
Ha ha ha, so I'm the bad guy here, huh?

1393
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:08,560
Huh?

1394
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:10,280
Oh, hey.

1395
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:13,280
Did you tell River that thing from back then?

1396
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,540
So ominous.

1397
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:18,260
I did.

1398
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,920
So how did she take it?

1399
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,800
For the most part, she took it well.

1400
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:26,060
But something bugs me.

1401
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,280
That thing from that time?

1402
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:29,800
That place?

1403
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:31,180
The thing?

1404
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:39,440
Ever since the incident, she's been making these strange rabbits out of paper.

1405
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:41,620
rabbits?

1406
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:42,600
Yeah.

1407
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:44,120
Oregarmy.

1408
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:46,680
Lots of them.

1409
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:47,720
Ha.

1410
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,820
I used to fold Oregarmy animals for my daughter all the time.

1411
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,540
What's wrong with that?

1412
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:55,960
I don't think it's the same thing.

1413
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,820
She's been doing nothing but making the same rabbits.

1414
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,860
Day in and day out.

1415
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:06,260
Our house is literally filled with them now.

1416
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,220
Didn't Isabel say that something... That something like that?

1417
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,120
as a common trait with River's condition?

1418
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,220
Yes, but something doesn't feel right this time.

1419
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,580
When I ask her about it, she never answers.

1420
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,440
Instead, she gets this distant look in her eyes.

1421
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:29,200
It's almost as if she wants something from me.

1422
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:35,520
And the strange thing is, I feel like there's something I owe her to.

1423
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,540
The ghost bartender is spooky.

1424
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,680
Have you asked, Isabel?

1425
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,940
yes she said she talked to her about it but got nothing

1426
01:36:50,080 --> 01:37:04,080
well I'm certainly not one to inquire but I'll tell you this I've known you since middle school and you're notorious for overthinking you're probably just imagining things there's no need to get too worked up huh?

1427

Wait, does that mean you don't have any money?

Hello.

Could I get a bottle of pickled olives, please?

01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:37,480
Sure, cash or credit.

1438
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,140
Just put it on my tab.

1439
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:41,000
I feel like spending big today.

1440
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,780
Oh, thank you, sir.

1441
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,580
Thanks, bro.

1442
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,600
You'll be getting an enormous amount of tips today.

1443
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:51,980
Thank you, sir.

1444
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,000
You're such an ass, Neil.

1445
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,700
Oh, loosen up.

1446
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:59,900
Okay, so we...

1447
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:05,120
Why, is that a bottle of pickled olives you're sporting?

1448
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:07,240
Yeah?

1449
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,520
Are you a fellow olive lover?

1450
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:14,540
Indeed I am.

1451
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,400
Just got a fresh bottle of them myself, in fact.

1452
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,400
Mind if I join you?

1453
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,600
Sure, why don't you grab a seat?

1454
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,440
We'll down a bottle together.

1455
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,060
This is boyhood.

1456
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:30,540
This is the true spirit of boyhood.

1457
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:34,440
Getting a whole jar of olives and just chugging it.

1458
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,280
Oh, yeah, that sounds just swell.

1459
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:41,760
Keep up.

1460
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,060
Disable taste simulation.

1461
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:43,700
Now!

1462
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,360
Good thing is...

1463
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,020
Just olives and non-vitical ethanol.

1464
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:55,540
Oh, Neil.

1465
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:56,680
I don't feel like it.

1466
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:58,000
I don't think I feel like it.

1467
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:03,040
I'm so gonna get you back for this.

1468
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,720
Chugga chugga.

1469
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,780
So that's how we got our first toaster.

1470
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:09,320
Oh.

1471
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:10,820
Ah.

1472
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:11,380
Ah.

1473
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,540
You okay there?

1474
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,180
Yes.

1475
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:19,760
I'm just savoring the amazingness of pickled olives.

1476
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:21,400
Olive juice.

1477
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:22,900
Mint.

1478
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,220
That's what I said, though.

1479
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:27,580
Olive juice.

1480
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,040
There are olives that are pickled in wine?

1481
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,480
You're getting late at the night.

1482
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,580
They're wonderful, aren't they?

1483
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:38,740
Yeah.

1484
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:45,240
I just can't understand how anyone could find such things to be disgusting.

1485
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:50,180
Say olive juice while holding your tongue.

1486
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:55,280
Olive juice.

1487
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:00,220
Olive.

1488
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:01,780
Olive.

1489
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,400
What

1490
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:23,160
am I saying?

1491
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,580
Olive juice.

1492
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:27,940
Olive.

1493
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:30,220
Olive juice.

1494
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:40,010
She loves us!

1495
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:42,450
She loves us.

1496
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:48,350
Take your time!

1497
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:49,850
We've got two bottles left!

1498
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,350
This is so silly.

1499
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:56,430
So I said, hey, that's not right!

1500
01:41:56,850 --> 01:41:58,150
And they totally agreed!

1501
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:01,370
Counselorship, thank you so much for the big!

1502
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:03,850
Happy to see you play this classic.

1503
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:05,310
I'm happy to play it too!

1504
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:10,710
You know what else is wrong with society today?

1505
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:16,470
Yeah, actually I have it right here.

1506
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:16,910
Why?

1507
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,610
May I see it?

1508
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,850
Uh, okay.

1509
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:22,950
Here it is.

1510
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:25,450
And freeze!

1511
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:30,030
Finally, dear Lord!

1512
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:32,770
How are the olives, Neil?

1513
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:34,510
Oh, shut your mouth.

1514
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,530
What is this?

1515
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:40,410
Wait.

1516
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,990
I can't stop yawning.

1517
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:44,590
Sorry, guys.

1518
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:45,530
Don't you dare.

1519
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:46,670
Don't worry.

1520
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:47,590
Sheesh.

1521
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:50,610
See, I'm doing it by the books.

1522
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,070
What was he doing?

1523
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:58,840
Hulk smash!

1524
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,940
Neil, seriously?

1525
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:05,880
Trying to get into this and you're ruining the mood.

1526
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:07,920
Totally worth it.

1527
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,200
Yeah, he is a doobly.

1528
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:14,660
Oh,

1529
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:21,790
this one's kind of awkward looking.

1530
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:28,990
Wait, like...

1531
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:30,570
Um...

1532
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,390
Wait, okay.

1533
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:33,810
Is it supposed to...

1534
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,080
That's copyrighted!

1535
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,540
I had it?

1536
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:45,960
I did?

1537
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:46,520
Wait, only...

1538
01:43:46,540 --> 01:44:14,720
line i can't i can't it's it's supposed it's supposed to be darker right i was just it's not as hard as it looks there we go it's because the background was darker than the foreground or the whatever that's fine activate memento what is this

1539
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,970
Oh my gosh!

1540
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:27,450
They're so young!

1541
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:29,330
Little babies.

1542
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,740
Wow, a beautiful sunset.

1543
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:42,440
Isn't it kind of dangerous that there's just this like island and the lighthouse doesn't work?

1544
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:45,100
Crikey, nutcrackers!

1545
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,880
You aren't Australian.

1546
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:49,240
Who cares?

1547
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,940
We're like 200 billion nanometers off the ground and standing on a damn flagpole.

1548
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:00,120
Just jump down.

1549
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,600
It's not like you can be hurt here.

1550
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:03,060
Are you kidding me?

1551
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,760
It's a freaking skydive.

1552
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,580
You can't stay on here.

1553
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:09,700
You can't get off.

1554
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:10,980
God, I hate when this happens.

1555
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,000
You're just gonna push him.

1556
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:16,500
Eva, what the?

1557
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:19,580
Woos.

1558
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:22,920
No fall damage.

1559
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:23,560
It's fine.

1560
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,560
Wait, where'd he go?

1561
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:27,620
Oh.

1562
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:59,960
why would they abandon her like this I suppose she's just no longer needed no longer needed by ships I mean you know how it is now that everything has GPS and all that I still think even with GPS they're still necessary no look river

1563
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:05,500
This place means a lot to me too, and I've been thinking.

1564
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,160
In our current state, things have been pretty stable.

1565
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,700
If we save well in a few years, we could afford to build a house on top of here.

1566
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:20,940
We'd be able to see her from the window!

1567
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:25,340
In the morning, at night, we'd always be nearby.

1568
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,120
And... and we could walk here any time.

1569
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,920
She'll never be alone again, John!

1570
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,780
I'll be able to watch over her every day.

1571
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:40,880
Yeah, we will.

1572
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:45,580
Whoa.

1573
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:52,730
Good for them.

1574
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:55,370
You gotta be kidding me.

1575
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:57,810
You remember what happens, don't you?

1576
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:00,330
It's like watching a train wreck.

1577
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:07,010
The ending isn't any more important than any...

1578
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:09,970
of the memories or any of the moments leading up to it.

1579
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:14,510
The important thing is that over here, they are happy.

1580
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:18,930
Let's move on.

1581
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:21,370
Hold on, I'm going to take a cough drop real quick.

1582
01:47:21,570 --> 01:47:22,010
Sorry, guys.

1583
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:30,210
Well, look at them.

1584
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:32,810
Cute.

1585
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:40,420
For some reason, I had it in my brain that this game was voiced, so...

1586
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:43,400
Wait a minute.

1587
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:47,540
They were referring to the lighthouse as Anya, weren't they?

1588
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:50,820
I suppose so.

1589
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:57,520
Then that river, she declined treatment for the sake of a lighthouse?

1590
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:02,390
Am I sick?

1591
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:09,570
No, I think I've just been talking a lot lately, so my throat is a little icky.

1592
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:15,150
But I'll have some days off next week, so it's okay.

1593
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:16,710
I will not talk so much.

1594
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:18,150
Yeah.

1595
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:20,290
Hmm.

1596
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:23,930
Isn't that a bit too extreme?

1597
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:29,170
I've seen stranger things in the course of the job.

1598
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:34,330
Me too, but I can never wrap my head around it.

1599
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:36,530
It's none of our business anyway.

1600
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:38,390
She's not our client.

1601
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:40,170
Anya.

1602
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:47,570
So it's the lighthouse?

1603
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:49,810
No.

1604
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:00,620
Oh, gosh!

1605
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:02,880
It scared me!

1606
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:05,840
Freaky!

1607
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:08,740
We passed right through them!

1608
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:16,900
Oh, we got out.

1609
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:17,100
Wait.

1610
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:18,200
There's a rabbit here.

1611
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:19,440
Oh, this is the thing.

1612
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,220
I guess there's probably not anything else for us.

1613
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:23,800
Yeah, okay.

1614
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,220
Why is it here, though?

1615
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,100
It's kind of weird.

1616
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:29,800
Happy Aussie Day!

1617
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,520
Thank you!

1618
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,240
Prepare the Memento.

1619
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:41,940
Let's see.

1620
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,220
Okay, the ideal is five.

1621
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:45,440
That makes me scared.

1622
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:52,670
Wait.

1623
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:56,170
I'm not good at like mapping these out in my head.

1624
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:57,250
You know what I mean?

1625
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:06,790
Uh...

1626
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:07,850
Memento, hi wisps.

1627
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:08,250
Hello!

1628
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:08,990
Hello, hello!

1629
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:13,270
If it's not checkerboard, you need a diagonal move.

1630
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:14,750
Ah!

1631
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,390
Brute force, Azoy.

1632
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:23,130
Now it's Checker.

1633
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:36,390
Wow, that hint actually helped so much.

1634
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:40,490
That actually helped like a ton, thank you.

1635
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:43,870
That makes it easier, doesn't it?

1636
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:44,390
Yeah!

1637
01:50:45,710 --> 01:50:46,670
Good job!

1638
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:47,150
No!

1639
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:49,210
Oh, you guys helped me.

1640
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:53,810
Little bunny.

1641
01:50:58,230 --> 01:50:58,870
River?

1642
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,960
Oh, gosh.

1643
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:13,520
A yellow paper rabbit.

1644
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,060
Dear Lord, not again.

1645
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,320
Is River already getting sick?

1646
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:20,800
I wonder.

1647
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,020
Uh, uh, uh, wait.

1648
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:27,660
There we go.

1649
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:32,790
Mm-hmm.

1650
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:35,730
An old baby grand piano.

1651
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:38,430
How the heck did they move this thing upstairs?

1652
01:51:39,330 --> 01:51:39,970
Who knows?

1653
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:43,430
But I bet it'd be a piece of cake for the TARDIS!

1654
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:45,630
Why is this guy allowed to talk?

1655
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:48,230
Not really.

1656
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:49,610
You can't even get it through the door.

1657
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:52,810
True.

1658
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:54,090
Well, that settles it.

1659
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:56,230
Moving pianos is a pain in the arse for everybody.

1660
01:51:57,390 --> 01:51:59,550
It'd probably take an entire episode to get it inside.

1661
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,360
I wouldn't mind seeing such an episode.

1662
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,260
Me neither.

1663
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:08,040
It sounds pretty epic.

1664
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,320
Wait, I thought I saw this.

1665
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:13,880
New boxes of plain paper?

1666
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:15,000
Uh-oh.

1667
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:16,560
I think I know where this is going.

1668
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:19,660
Oh!

1669
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:26,550
You went out for a haircut this early in the morning?

1670
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:35,690
What are you making there?

1671
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:41,290
Rabbits.

1672
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:44,310
Did you see the rabbit I left for you?

1673
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:45,910
Yeah.

1674
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:50,050
Tell me about that rabbit.

1675
01:52:51,670 --> 01:52:51,730
Huh?

1676
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:54,430
Describe the rabbit.

1677
01:52:58,510 --> 01:52:59,230
One...

1678
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:00,470
Was it yellow?

1679
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:02,450
What else?

1680
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:04,070
A bit puffy.

1681
01:53:05,730 --> 01:53:06,010
And?

1682
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,360
Well, it's just a paper rabbit.

1683
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,780
I don't know how else to describe it.

1684
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:16,240
Describe the rabbit.

1685
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:18,140
Hmm?

1686
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,340
You're acting strange, River.

1687
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:22,980
Is something wrong?

1688
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:25,660
River?

1689
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,060
I'm confused.

1690
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:37,600
I don't know about you, but I'm getting some inverse deja vu.

1691
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,960
I think I know of her condition, but this is rather odd even for that.

1692
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,260
You think she's...

1693
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:48,840
Do you?

1694
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:51,920
Am I stupid?

1695
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,120
What are they inferring?

1696
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,080
Perhaps, who knows?

1697
01:53:57,420 --> 01:53:58,940
You think she's...

1698
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:01,100
She is Minto.

1699
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:08,770
But like you said, she's not our client.

1700
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,050
Origarmi.

1701
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:15,790
Let's just get what we're paid for over with.

1702
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:22,420
Many long strands of orange hair.

1703
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:25,460
That's not good.

1704
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,660
Okay, we found the...

1705
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:30,080
It's a platypus.

1706
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,500
So this is the day she started it, huh?

1707
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,160
No, no spoilers, guys.

1708
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:36,920
No spoilers.

1709
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:44,120
If I ask questions, sometimes they're just like for me to talk out loud.

1710
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,300
Let's prepare the minamindu.

1711
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,300
Three ideal.

1712
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,620
Okay, so if I do this...

1713
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:03,560
Oh, I misclicked!

1714
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:13,960
Oopsie Yippee The platypus

1715
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:18,400
I misclicked

1716
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,480
Um...

1717
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:30,480
Like how he's like hiding under the car Oh my gosh, not in the middle of the roads But it's scary

1718
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:40,710
This way?

1719
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:46,820
This way?

1720
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:50,620
Oh.

1721
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:03,540
The music is so somber.

1722
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:04,400
Oh no!

1723
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:07,000
It's making me feel kind of weird.

1724
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:09,040
Kind of weird.

1725
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,280
So there shouldn't be, I guess there's nothing here.

1726
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:15,020
Like their house has not been built.

1727
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:18,160
This is where the house used to be, isn't it?

1728
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,020
The house that never should have been.

1729
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,600
I mean, really.

1730
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:49,080
What is it about unusually high and dangerous places attract people new note acrophobia how is that a new note when that is his opinion i kind of okay though i'll be honest you guys i kind of have an obsession with that apartment building in new york city that's just like ridiculously high and now recently it's been like kind of crumbling

1731
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:57,770
have you guys heard of it The toothpick.

1732
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:08,270
The one with the hole in the middle?

1733
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:09,850
Yeah, it has a hole in the middle.

1734
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:14,390
Here, before we get to the story, I'll describe it a little bit.

1735
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:16,590
A healthy obsession, right?

1736
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:18,790
I just like looking into it.

1737
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:22,990
So basically, they made this extremely tall...

1738
01:57:22,990 --> 01:57:24,450
Like, it's basically...

1739
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:27,730
I would say a toothpick, but it's actually, like, just a rectangle.

1740
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:32,810
So it's a very tall apartment building.

1741
01:57:34,510 --> 01:58:00,450
and um they had to put like holes in it kind of in in it to help with the swaying because it's so tall and so thin and it's not very like wind resistant and like people that live there describe it as like if if you're on the higher floors and it's a it's a windy day they describe it like as bad as a boat rocking.

1742
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:03,530
And 432 Park Ave?

1743
01:58:03,590 --> 01:58:05,090
I believe that's the name of it.

1744
01:58:05,230 --> 01:58:06,290
I'm not good with numbers.

1745
01:58:09,190 --> 01:58:10,470
And also...

1746
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:13,690
And also, they didn't...

1747
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:16,390
They didn't account for like...

1748
01:58:17,810 --> 01:58:19,090
I guess...

1749
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:20,990
I don't even know, like padding?

1750
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:22,970
I don't even know how to describe it.

1751
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:24,390
But when they drop...

1752
01:58:25,070 --> 01:58:30,330
When they drop their garbage down, the garbage chute from like the higher floors.

1753
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:32,850
It is going straight down.

1754
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:35,430
It is going down, down, down.

1755
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:42,430
And then people have described that the noise when it drops is so loud that it sounds like a bomb is going off.

1756
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:43,610
Like it is.

1757
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:53,370
And the people that built it, they were like, we want to build this out of concrete, but we want it to be aesthetically pleasing.

1758
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:57,550
So they were told if they built it out of white concrete.

1759
01:58:57,990 --> 01:59:59,090
that it would crack and so that but they were like no we want it to look good so we'll do that and so now it is starting to crack and chip and like little pieces are falling from like these thousands of feet in the air whatever the hell and like dropping onto the ground which you know if it's going at that kind of speed it's going to literally be like a bullet to somebody's head and they were told this they were told that it will crack if they use they could go with the white concrete or they could go with regular concrete and it would be more sturdy and they were like nah we want it to look good and so now the people that are living there are the ones having to foot the bill to repair the building and like power outages go happen all the time and people get trapped in the elevator and it's just it's just horrible hold on i'm gonna double check if it was oh wait uh

1760
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:19,240
yeah 432 park avenue it's it's almost 1400 feet tall and there's concrete falling from there and it's just like it's so ugly

1761
02:00:25,260 --> 02:01:01,220
it's so it's so terrible apparently it's designed by the same architect i think he's doing this on purpose i'm not gonna lie because it's designed by the same architect i can't remember his name but he also designed another building somewhere in europe but it was like angled at a in a way that where like the the sun reflecting off the building was literally like melting cars why did they keep letting this guy who Who gave this guy a degree?

1762
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:07,900
He's notorious.

1763
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1764
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,860
The one in London.

1765
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,100
Is that where it's at?

1766
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,200
Oh, gosh.

1767
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,580
Like, who allowed this guy to have an architecture degree?

1768
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:23,980
Who passed his class?

1769
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:26,200
Anyway.

1770
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:28,140
Why did I start talking about that?

1771
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:28,840
I don't remember.

1772
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:37,280
But yeah, look up 432 Park Avenue if you want, like, it's kind of insane.

1773
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:41,700
Okay.

1774
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:45,420
Back to...

1775
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:46,640
Oh, the acrophobia!

1776
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:47,860
That's right, the heights.

1777
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:52,820
Crazy.

1778
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:54,460
I don't have a fear of heights, though.

1779
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:58,700
I'll live at the 432 Park Avenue.

1780
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,600
I'll take one for the team.

1781
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:02,880
Back to Gim.

1782
02:02:04,980 --> 02:02:05,900
River, says.

1783
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,320
Is that why you approached me back then?

1784
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:11,540
Fallen, thank you so much for the big!

1785
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:15,400
Natural born weapons designer decides to work in architecture.

1786
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:17,720
Yeah.

1787
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:20,860
What about now?

1788
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:24,640
I suppose it's just a part of it.

1789
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,060
Look, it was a long time ago.

1790
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,520
It's not too relevant now.

1791
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:35,080
But Izzy said, I should tell you the truth.

1792
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,860
I shouldn't have tainted our first meeting like that.

1793
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:40,380
What?

1794
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:49,470
Huh?

1795
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:50,350
Oh.

1796
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:51,630
Is she not?

1797
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:51,930
Oh.

1798
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:53,190
What is that?

1799
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:54,530
What is that?

1800
02:02:54,610 --> 02:02:55,290
A hacky sack?

1801
02:02:57,270 --> 02:03:01,090
You're a diehard wisp and you want to see Mito ahead of the other wisp?

1802
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:01,990
What do you mean?

1803
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:07,510
Can you throw this as far as where Anya's out?

1804
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:09,690
I don't know.

1805
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:10,630
You want me to try?

1806
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:12,570
Would you?

1807
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:21,240
Whoa.

1808
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:23,020
River!

1809
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:24,420
Are you insane?

1810
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:25,240
Get away from there!

1811
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:30,930
What?

1812
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:31,570
What?

1813
02:03:36,730 --> 02:03:39,470
I think this memory isn't too far from the last.

1814
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:41,590
I think they may be connected?

1815
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:42,930
Probably.

1816
02:03:44,910 --> 02:03:45,330
Oh.

1817
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:47,050
Wait, I'm trying to...

1818
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:48,070
It says I can go this way.

1819
02:03:48,090 --> 02:04:02,090
but oh i have to click maybe oh there we go okay uh this one why did she cut her hair anyway i like long hair who cares what you like kneel

1820
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:09,850
yeah i liked her with long hair

1821
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:19,650
it didn't look like she cut it so short am i crazy prepare the memento

1822
02:04:24,030 --> 02:04:38,100
One, two, three, three, four.

1823
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:40,300
Easy.

1824
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:46,980
Activate memento.

1825
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:50,040
She's gaming!

1826
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:51,700
Genius, genius, genius!

1827
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:52,940
Stab!

1828
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:54,080
Stab!

1829
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:03,330
Everyone with it is different, John.

1830
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:36,120
just because she and I share the syndrome doesn't mean we share the same head but you must be able to help somehow everything was okay at first but now she's even more aloof than before syndrome Chunibio syndrome even when we're in the same room she's never really there it's starting to take a toll on me.

1831
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,200
Trash boy, thank you so much.

1832
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:39,100
Welcome back.

1833
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:45,810
I just don't know how to take it anymore.

1834
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:51,490
Well, I can't speak for her, but many of us do long for connections.

1835
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:58,310
Though, being able to articulate it is a different story.

1836
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:03,490
Just because she struggles to express it doesn't mean she doesn't feel anything.

1837
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:05,790
She's still there, right?

1838
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:09,530
Sometimes you just have to have faith that she cares.

1839
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,550
Happy OECD.

1840
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:12,430
Thank you!

1841
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:14,030
Thank you so much!

1842
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:18,070
Hope your cat has stopped farting when you hug them.

1843
02:06:19,190 --> 02:06:19,970
Thank you, Walt.

1844
02:06:22,510 --> 02:06:23,690
Thank you so much.

1845
02:06:26,730 --> 02:06:29,670
That's pretty difficult to do day in and day out.

1846
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:31,270
I know.

1847
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:33,630
I've just stopped holding her.

1848
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:36,550
My cat.

1849
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:40,450
Wait, but why do you seem so normal, is he?

1850
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:43,370
I mean, don't you have the same condition?

1851
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:46,710
For one, I was diagnosed when I was still young.

1852
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:51,510
With effort, it's not impossible to acquire a guise of social norms systematically.

1853
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:54,390
But you know what?

1854
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:56,610
I both envy and pity River.

1855
02:07:02,970 --> 02:07:06,230
Me, I'm an actress, because I've been doing it all my life.

1856
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:11,110
Not only on stage, but offstage, and at practically every moment.

1857
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:15,090
good at it because acting is the only option I have.

1858
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:18,610
It's the only way for me to be normal.

1859
02:07:20,830 --> 02:07:22,750
Well, River, she never did that.

1860
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:29,400
She remained an outcast and refused to learn to step against it.

1861
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:34,660
I don't know if it was by choice or by limit, whether bravery or cowardice.

1862
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:40,620
There are days when I just can't stand faking it anymore.

1863
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:45,660
And then I realize that it's too late.

1864
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:52,620
The Isabel that people know know of is all an act and the real me has long become a stranger.

1865
02:07:54,860 --> 02:07:56,880
I think in the end I just envy her.

1866
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:05,990
I've never met a woman with it before.

1867
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:08,770
Then technically you still haven't met one.

1868
02:08:10,770 --> 02:08:12,190
This isn't part of our business.

1869
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:13,050
Let's move.

1870
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:17,850
Why are they like not saying anything?

1871
02:08:18,650 --> 02:08:19,950
Like it's taboo to say.

1872
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:21,290
Like is it autism?

1873
02:08:22,450 --> 02:08:25,090
Is it just taboo to say that for some reason?

1874
02:08:25,950 --> 02:08:29,250
The world would be a lot more beautiful if people just remembered faces more.

1875
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:38,760
Anything new today?

1876
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:40,340
No.

1877
02:08:42,860 --> 02:08:43,900
Different times.

1878
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:45,160
It's an old game.

1879
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,580
Oh, this game is from 2011?

1880
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:49,400
Ah!

1881
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:52,180
I guess that makes sense.

1882
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:57,140
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

1883
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,440
What are you rereading there?

1884
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,640
The Emperor's New Clothes.

1885
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:06,780
I love this when I was young.

1886
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:08,500
Still do, huh?

1887
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,200
Of course.

1888
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:12,780
Just for different reasons.

1889
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:20,060
When I was a kid, I loved the Animorph series.

1890
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:22,800
I know.

1891
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:26,780
Your mother gave you a book from it as a wedding present.

1892
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:28,020
Whoa!

1893
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:35,180
Some people ask for pots and pans And other people ask for Animorphs books

1894
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:54,030
That's crazy Read this, Johnny Read this and remember that your love is always transforming Like an Animorph

1895
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,600
The wedding registry is just the whole series

1896
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:10,410
Animorphs is goaded though I'm not saying it's not.

1897
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:15,250
I just think it's a wild thing for a wedding gift.

1898
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:17,690
Yeah.

1899
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:19,870
That was one odd wedding present.

1900
02:10:20,030 --> 02:10:21,670
Okay, at least he acknowledges that.

1901
02:10:22,410 --> 02:10:24,890
I guess I was pretty obsessed with it when I was a kid.

1902
02:10:27,210 --> 02:10:28,550
Why haven't you read them since?

1903
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:29,990
Hmm?

1904
02:10:31,730 --> 02:10:32,650
I saw them.

1905
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:34,810
They're collecting dust in the garage.

1906
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:37,770
His dad gave him a copy of the emperor's new clothes.

1907
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:38,630
Hmm?

1908
02:10:39,150 --> 02:10:41,430
Well, I just grew out of them, I guess.

1909
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:46,460
I mean, they're children's books.

1910
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,560
What's wrong with reading children's books?

1911
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:51,720
They're comforting.

1912
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:54,840
I suppose so.

1913
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:56,080
I don't know.

1914
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:58,340
The Animorph series is kind of messed up.

1915
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:01,260
I don't think it's very comforting at all.

1916
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,120
Some kids get stuck as animals.

1917
02:11:09,270 --> 02:11:11,210
I think I'm going to get this one.

1918
02:11:12,370 --> 02:11:13,670
Xenomorphs is dark.

1919
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:16,370
It's not like a...

1920
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:18,590
Whoa.

1921
02:11:19,410 --> 02:11:19,670
Whoa.

1922
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:23,230
I'm not yours.

1923
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:24,470
You're not mine.

1924
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:26,810
Be my anti-Valentine.

1925
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:28,050
Hey, River.

1926
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:29,710
This one's not that corny.

1927
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:31,130
River?

1928
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:37,720
Be my anti-Valentine.

1929
02:11:43,030 --> 02:11:44,870
But what about David's?

1930
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:46,710
He's my favorite character.

1931
02:11:47,890 --> 02:11:48,730
I don't know.

1932
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:50,390
What are you talking about?

1933
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:51,630
Animorphs?

1934
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:52,490
Have you read it?

1935
02:11:53,010 --> 02:11:53,290
No.

1936
02:11:53,830 --> 02:11:54,110
Yes.

1937
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:54,990
Really?

1938
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:56,270
Sort of.

1939
02:11:56,710 --> 02:11:57,210
Oh, whoa.

1940
02:11:57,590 --> 02:12:00,050
Do you know what animal is David's main morph?

1941
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,450
Um.

1942
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:02,770
Oh.

1943
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:05,370
Wait, what?

1944
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:06,070
Um.

1945
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:08,070
Uh, David.

1946
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:09,990
David.

1947
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:17,410
I'm gonna guess a hawk.

1948
02:12:18,690 --> 02:12:19,350
I don't know.

1949
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:20,550
A bird.

1950
02:12:22,150 --> 02:12:22,630
Hawk!

1951
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:24,870
That doesn't sound right.

1952
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:28,390
Don't worry, I'll find it out for you.

1953
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:30,730
I got- what is it?

1954
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:32,330
Wait, can I do it again?

1955
02:12:33,490 --> 02:12:34,690
Oh, I can, I can!

1956
02:12:37,490 --> 02:12:39,850
Snake- wait, if it's David...

1957
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:40,910
No!

1958
02:12:41,290 --> 02:12:41,750
It couldn't!

1959
02:12:42,070 --> 02:12:44,110
What do you mean it's not a snake?

1960
02:12:48,270 --> 02:12:50,090
You can find the answer, or can I?

1961
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:51,590
Uh...

1962
02:12:55,010 --> 02:12:58,060
Your mom...

1963
02:12:58,060 --> 02:12:58,540
Okay, hold on.

1964
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:00,100
Let's go find it.

1965
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:03,900
Maybe somebody knows the answer.

1966
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:05,700
Can I research it?

1967
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:11,280
Oh.

1968
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:13,380
Okay, it's that book.

1969
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:16,300
Uh...

1970
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,100
Okay.

1971
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:19,420
Animorphs.

1972
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:27,600
No elf?

1973
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:31,360
I'm gonna Google it then.

1974
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:37,280
David and Morphs.

1975
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,640
David is the villain.

1976
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,560
What is he transforming to?

1977
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:51,120
What's his morph?

1978
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:52,880
What's his main morph?

1979
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:55,440
I'm having...

1980
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,140
He found the morphing cube.

1981
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:02,960
What can he turn...

1982
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:05,440
Yurk?

1983
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:05,960
No.

1984
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:09,480
She's cheating.

1985
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:11,680
It's called using your resources.

1986
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:20,830
Oh wait, to the moon is awesome.

1987
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:24,230
There's a thing.

1988
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:26,590
No stinking way.

1989
02:14:27,710 --> 02:14:28,810
I was close!

1990
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:30,350
It's a cobra!

1991
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:35,170
No stinking way!

1992
02:14:37,330 --> 02:14:40,430
I really wish they kept the old covers instead of these plain sheets.

1993
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:41,750
They were so cool.

1994
02:14:42,850 --> 02:14:44,830
It's a kind of snake.

1995
02:14:49,090 --> 02:14:50,230
Tobias Hawk.

1996
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:51,330
I was close.

1997
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:52,870
Oh, wait.

1998
02:14:53,450 --> 02:14:54,510
She would have told us.

1999
02:14:56,990 --> 02:14:58,350
Rachel Grizzly.

2000
02:14:58,750 --> 02:14:59,650
Jake Tiger.

2001
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:01,090
Marco Gorilla.

2002
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:02,510
David Cobra.

2003
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:03,890
Cassie Wolf.

2004
02:15:04,370 --> 02:15:04,690
Why?

2005
02:15:05,410 --> 02:15:06,290
Oh, just wondering.

2006
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:07,030
I...

2007
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:08,750
Why did I guess Hawk?

2008
02:15:11,350 --> 02:15:13,410
How did I guess it?

2009
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:15,630
And then it also was a type of snake.

2010
02:15:17,770 --> 02:15:18,210
Crazy.

2011
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:21,850
You could have just Googled it.

2012
02:15:22,570 --> 02:15:23,470
I did, actually.

2013
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:28,190
River calling me out.

2014
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:29,230
No?

2015
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:30,510
I did Google it.

2016
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:31,650
I was just talking to her.

2017
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:36,330
Prepare the memento.

2018
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:40,210
No!

2019
02:15:40,770 --> 02:15:41,130
No!

2020
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:44,940
Uh-oh.

2021
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:47,280
This seems tricky.

2022
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:51,180
Wait a second.

2023
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:53,020
No, it's not.

2024
02:15:57,980 --> 02:16:00,440
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2025
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:02,080
Easy peasy.

2026
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:04,120
Animorphs.

2027
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:05,960
This is so crazy.

2028
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:11,160
I can't believe Animorphs has such a big part of this story.

2029
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:15,920
Wait, are we at their wedding?

2030
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:19,900
The olive juices are in here too.

2031
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:23,360
Aw, everyone's leaving already, but I just got here.

2032
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:24,360
Kita bakari!

2033
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:28,200
Seems to happen to you a lot of parties.

2034
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:31,720
Oh, go save your childish jabs for the insecure.

2035
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:39,910
A glass bottle of pickled olives.

2036
02:16:40,810 --> 02:16:43,610
I see the foiege, but where is the mouse?

2037
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:48,910
That's the corneous remark you've made all night.

2038
02:16:49,650 --> 02:16:51,330
Anamorphs is a core memory, it seems.

2039
02:16:51,590 --> 02:16:52,070
So true.

2040
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:55,710
Don't you mean cheesiest remark?

2041
02:16:57,070 --> 02:16:57,430
Wow.

2042
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:01,570
Aged Anamorphs book.

2043
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:09,800
This person looks like they're covered in blood or something.

2044
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:11,080
What's going on there?

2045
02:17:13,220 --> 02:17:13,820
Huh?

2046
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:24,620
Oh gosh, it's like impossible getting through these tiny little tables and stuff.

2047
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,740
Excuse me.

2048
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:29,340
Why did I get over here?

2049
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:31,100
Oh, there we go.

2050
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:36,600
Oh, sorry I didn't see who ran it, but thank you so much.

2051
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:37,620
Thank you, thank you.

2052
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:39,660
Thank you guys for the gift.

2053
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:40,660
Thank you.

2054
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:44,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2055
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:47,240
Welcome, welcome.

2056
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:48,700
Oh, it is their wedding!

2057
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:49,720
Oh my gosh.

2058
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:51,540
Why do they look so sad?

2059
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:57,080
Oh.

2060
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:02,000
Wait, I didn't...

2061
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:04,240
Wait, what's going on?

2062
02:18:11,130 --> 02:18:12,500
Do you feel any different?

2063
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:17,720
Now that we've got the rings on, I mean?

2064
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:19,320
Oh my gosh.

2065
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,440
Her dress colors!

2066
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:22,160
You're right!

2067
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:23,920
No.

2068
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,580
Why, do you?

2069
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:33,780
Actually, yeah, I think so.

2070
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:38,340
What is it like?

2071
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:43,950
It's just different.

2072
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:47,490
I know some of you are married.

2073
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:50,350
In my chat, you've told me.

2074
02:18:51,070 --> 02:18:52,210
Did you feel any different?

2075
02:18:53,630 --> 02:18:55,710
I don't think I've ever thought about it.

2076
02:18:56,210 --> 02:18:57,050
Because it's like...

2077
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,380
I've never thought about it.

2078
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,120
Does it feel different?

2079
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:10,560
Yeah, to meintosh.

2080
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:15,360
I feel like if I...

2081
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:15,980
I don't know.

2082
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:17,800
I don't know.

2083
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:19,000
You marriage!

2084
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:22,540
Not really, to be honest.

2085
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:30,000
No difference with me because we were already living together so long before getting married.

2086
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:31,120
Oh, that makes sense.

2087
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:33,500
Will you marry me?

2088
02:19:34,660 --> 02:19:36,700
Take a girl to dinner first.

2089
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:38,880
Try it on and see?

2090
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:41,260
We are...

2091
02:19:41,260 --> 02:19:42,500
We're married, aren't we?

2092
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:45,020
When's our ceremony?

2093
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:46,860
We haven't had the ceremony, Arca.

2094
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:49,740
Taxes will never be the same.

2095
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:51,080
Filing joy, baby.

2096
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:52,500
Will

2097
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:03,560
you marry me?

2098
02:20:04,060 --> 02:20:04,800
Kermit voice.

2099
02:20:05,180 --> 02:20:06,740
You want the Kermit voice?

2100
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:17,500
I learned recently that my voice for Kermit doesn't sound like Kermit at all.

2101
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:22,860
I think I didn't know what Kermit sounded like.

2102
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:27,940
I think I...

2103
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:39,160
Like, I always thought Kermit kind of sounded like this, but then I listened to Kermit and I was like, whoa, this just sounds like a, like a dude.

2104
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:50,170
I'm closer to the, what's his name?

2105
02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:53,730
The guy that made the puppets.

2106
02:20:54,990 --> 02:20:55,670
He was the voice.

2107
02:20:55,870 --> 02:20:56,610
I'm Jim Henson, yeah.

2108
02:20:56,890 --> 02:20:58,550
I'm Jim Henson, Kermit.

2109
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:07,000
I'm Miss Piggy.

2110
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:15,220
While David had a pet cobra, he never morphed it.

2111
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:18,120
His man morph was a lot... Oh, wait, are you...

2112
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:20,120
Are you... I'm actuallying the game?

2113
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:25,160
His man morph was a lion because he wanted to one-up Jake, whose man morph was a tiger.

2114
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:26,500
Oh my gosh!

2115
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:28,760
Happy Oshi Day to Frog Bird.

2116
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:30,700
Thank you.

2117
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:36,100
Yeah, every day should be Yoshi day for me.

2118
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:39,440
Okay, back to the game, sorry.

2119
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:42,580
It's different.

2120
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:46,100
Just the responsibilities, I suppose.

2121
02:21:46,380 --> 02:21:47,680
Okay, okay.

2122
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:49,520
Responsibilities.

2123
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:55,010
Do you like the name Anya?

2124
02:21:57,370 --> 02:21:57,770
Oh?

2125
02:22:02,580 --> 02:22:04,100
Would you like...

2126
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:05,420
Would you like to name her Anya?

2127
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:13,820
I understand.

2128
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:14,160
What?

2129
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:15,040
I don't.

2130
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:20,470
Well, he's the one that married her.

2131
02:22:20,610 --> 02:22:21,930
He should get her more than...

2132
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:23,770
Anya's a good name for her.

2133
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:28,310
He should get her more than any of us.

2134
02:22:28,690 --> 02:22:29,750
Hey, come with me!

2135
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:38,320
They're cute.

2136
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:39,200
They're cute!

2137
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:54,610
This can't be a good idea.

2138
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:56,310
trip and fall.

2139
02:22:58,830 --> 02:23:00,650
Don't worry, just follow my steps.

2140
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:03,430
Are they kissing?

2141
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:15,050
Ow, my ass!

2142
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:19,750
I think you stepped on my toes.

2143
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:21,010
Sorry.

2144
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:23,410
Come on, let's try again.

2145
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:25,730
Okay.

2146
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:32,700
Oh my god, they danced until sunrise.

2147
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,280
They...

2148
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:36,920
danced.

2149
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:46,980
First time, thank you!

2150
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:49,560
Thank you so much for the pink.

2151
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:58,200
To promise to love and comfort and honor and to keep in sickness and in health for as long as you shall live.

2152
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:00,360
I do.

2153
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:04,340
And do you take this man standing?

2154
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:10,100
Oh my gosh, wait, I could be like, actually being the one officiated maid, officiated.

2155
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:21,140
officially being the one I'm I'm doing the marrying would

2156
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:53,680
you officiate she officiate a wedding I would yeah put me in coach do you take this man standing before you to be your lawfully wedded husband to promise to love and comfort in honor and to keep in sickness and in health for as long as you shall live.

2157
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:57,320
That's exactly how I would say it, too.

2158
02:24:59,820 --> 02:25:04,180
By the power invested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2159
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:11,680
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Wiles.

2160
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:28,500
Yeah, what did you think that was?

2161
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:32,180
And with the power vested in me as Vittobar.

2162
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:35,240
I'm just bad at weddings, that's all.

2163
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,280
Fluids tend to escape from my eyes.

2164
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:41,000
My god, they're not escaping from anywhere else.

2165
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:43,820
I didn't know you were that sentimental.

2166
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:46,400
Oh, did I say my eyes?

2167
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:47,440
I meant my mouth.

2168
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:50,940
And by fluids, I meant both fluids and solids.

2169
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:55,780
That's a lovely image.

2170
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:56,540
Thanks, Neo.

2171
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:00,340
Let's find a way to get out of here.

2172
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:04,340
All this happiness and joy is really putting you off too, huh?

2173
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:05,220
Oh my gosh.

2174
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:07,340
Mew is literally like Riaju.

2175
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,200
Yucky.

2176
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:10,020
I hate the normies.

2177
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:14,420
No, I just don't like watching people make mistakes.

2178
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:18,180
Are you saying them getting together was a mistake?

2179
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:21,580
Cheesh, whatever happened to just take it moment by moment.

2180
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:24,120
Oh my god.

2181
02:26:32,070 --> 02:26:33,290
Make a mistake.

2182
02:26:33,390 --> 02:26:34,070
That's crazy.

2183
02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:42,000
she looks so pretty though

2184
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:55,100
yeah did she get a divorce or something she doesn't believe in marriage anymore

2185
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:00,480
oh the cake

2186
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:41,000

2187
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:47,980
Not another sentimental grandparent childhood.

2188
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:49,920
Ack.

2189
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:54,180
What do you have against those anyway?

2190
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:57,480
I mean, you should talk about your grandfather a lot.

2191
02:27:59,460 --> 02:27:59,640
What?

2192
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:00,480
No, I don't.

2193
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:01,920
Whatever you say.

2194
02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:03,720
We got Joey note.

2195
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:06,600
All right, just one more.

2196
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:13,510
And it's not the cake?

2197
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:19,020
This way.

2198
02:28:30,430 --> 02:28:56,530
I hear like a boop boop boop oh what is going on over here what is that what is this looks like a decapitated person I can't be helped River I'm sure they didn't mean to come on we're late wait is that a rabbit oh I see it now

2199
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:04,540
John plain name but I won't forget it.

2200
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:09,380
I think this is the source of all those folded paper ones.

2201
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:12,300
Why would she obsess over some roadkill?

2202
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:15,360
Not to mention so many years later.

2203
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:19,500
Don't ask me, you're the woman here.

2204
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:24,680
I'll be convinced that I'm the only one when you do a cordless bungee jump.

2205
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,120
You're the female.

2206
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:33,060
Dead robin.

2207
02:29:36,590 --> 02:29:38,470
Come on, River, we're late.

2208
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:46,360
I don't want to unlock this.

2209
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:47,820
How is this a Memento?

2210
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:51,560
I thought Mementos are supposed to be special.

2211
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:56,920
Oh, God.

2212
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:58,580
I don't like it.

2213
02:29:58,640 --> 02:29:59,800
I don't like it at all.

2214
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:09,300
It's special roadkill.

2215
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:10,660
It's my roadkill.

2216
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:17,060
You know, it's a fantastic wedding when the Memento's roadkill...

2217
02:30:17,060 --> 02:30:17,560
That's what happened.

2218
02:30:17,580 --> 02:30:18,500
I'm saying!

2219
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:25,780
Hey, maybe she saw it as a metaphor for the terrible marriage.

2220
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:30,500
So years later, she began folding the rabbits because she was reminded of how rotten it was.

2221
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:33,720
Hayden, thank you so much for the 20 gives a thank you.

2222
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:37,740
Or, you know, something equally pretentious.

2223
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:39,980
Cool story, Neil.

2224
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:44,440
Okay.

2225
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:47,320
Aww.

2226
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:50,960
I don't want to see it get run over.

2227
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:55,260
Okay, we are sent to the middle of the road.

2228
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:56,660
Poor thing.

2229
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:58,320
What's with all the road kills today?

2230
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:01,640
Don't you look at me like that?

2231
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:05,160
Smells like a farm.

2232
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:06,460
I had road kill.

2233
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:09,720
Deactivate the scent simulator or get away from here already.

2234
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:14,700
Okay, we'll just- oh, not this way.

2235
02:31:18,330 --> 02:31:18,730
Hmm.

2236
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:21,670
Rest in peace, Wabby.

2237
02:31:21,770 --> 02:31:23,830
Oh, oh, it scared me.

2238
02:31:24,050 --> 02:31:25,010
Oh, God.

2239
02:31:25,710 --> 02:31:26,290
Oh, my God.

2240
02:31:27,110 --> 02:31:28,330
What a majestic horse.

2241
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:32,050
Whoa.

2242
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:35,250
Don't do it.

2243
02:31:35,570 --> 02:31:36,230
Don't do what?

2244
02:31:36,670 --> 02:31:37,470
You know what?

2245
02:31:37,610 --> 02:31:38,250
Oh, my God.

2246
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:43,620
He wants to get with the horse.

2247
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:47,220
Don't not ride the horse?

2248
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:53,420
What, are you five years old?

2249
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:56,780
Okay, I won't not ride it.

2250
02:31:58,560 --> 02:31:59,120
Hiya!

2251
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,720
Quit wasting time, Neil.

2252
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:03,420
Oh, crap.

2253
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:05,380
I can't be good.

2254
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:08,340
Doing something.

2255
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:09,280
Don't just stand there.

2256
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:10,320
Help me!

2257
02:32:15,020 --> 02:32:15,740
Damn it.

2258
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:17,540
This was not in the job description.

2259
02:32:19,180 --> 02:32:20,440
Dr. Neil Watts.

2260
02:32:20,660 --> 02:32:20,840
Okay.

2261
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:23,520
So what are we doing here, huh?

2262
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:26,480
Am I supposed to go after him?

2263
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:28,200
Whoa, whoa, freaky.

2264
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:31,700
I guess I'll go make debut.

2265
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:34,640
I'll go after him, I guess.

2266
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:39,300
I get stuck on bushes.

2267
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:42,120
Hello?

2268
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:45,800
Oh, it's them.

2269
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:51,200
Hello?

2270
02:32:53,300 --> 02:32:56,440
I'm thought with words, but thank you for being here with us and thank you for being by us.

2271
02:32:58,260 --> 02:32:59,220
Thank you.

2272
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:00,020
Oh, here we go.

2273
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:02,600
Is that really a good idea?

2274
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:05,960
She should be okay.

2275
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:07,280
She's not new to this anymore.

2276
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,780
She has never done it by herself before.

2277
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:14,860
I'll be fine.

2278
02:33:15,140 --> 02:33:16,100
I'm not a child.

2279
02:33:17,220 --> 02:33:17,460
Whoa.

2280
02:33:17,800 --> 02:33:18,120
Ah!

2281
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:20,240
Bruh, fire!

2282
02:33:27,950 --> 02:33:29,170
Oh, she's getting it.

2283
02:33:29,430 --> 02:33:29,730
Maybe.

2284
02:33:31,950 --> 02:33:32,750
Oh, it's the matter.

2285
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:33,830
Let's go!

2286
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:35,490
Whoa.

2287
02:33:35,890 --> 02:33:36,950
Hey, wait up!

2288
02:33:38,710 --> 02:33:40,330
Can I ride the horse?

2289
02:33:41,050 --> 02:33:43,010
I wonder if Neil got off that horse yet.

2290
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:44,870
Eva!

2291
02:33:50,310 --> 02:33:53,190
This is about 19% more than I can handle.

2292
02:33:53,610 --> 02:33:54,510
This guy.

2293
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:56,390
What a moron.

2294
02:33:56,590 --> 02:33:58,070
I couldn't have said it better myself.

2295
02:34:00,570 --> 02:34:01,810
Oh, what the cord comb?

2296
02:34:02,050 --> 02:34:03,650
I want some corn.

2297
02:34:07,570 --> 02:34:07,890
Oh.

2298
02:34:08,710 --> 02:34:09,190
Whoa!

2299
02:34:11,230 --> 02:34:12,050
We're zooming?

2300
02:34:12,430 --> 02:34:13,570
Oh my gosh, we're really zooming.

2301
02:34:15,390 --> 02:34:16,390
Move out of the way!

2302
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:18,290
Who are you?

2303
02:34:18,470 --> 02:34:19,470
Oh, wait, there they are!

2304
02:34:21,330 --> 02:34:22,550
I'm the third wheel.

2305
02:34:23,150 --> 02:34:24,110
And their horse date.

2306
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:26,710
I'm third wheeling.

2307
02:34:28,290 --> 02:34:29,190
Are you good?

2308
02:34:29,650 --> 02:34:31,670
Oh, I got stuck on a rock and then a tree.

2309
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:33,250
We're zooming.

2310
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:36,210
I'm going around.

2311
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:50,840
I'm discovering things.

2312
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:56,860
The rabbit.

2313
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:06,380
I haven't discovered much.

2314
02:35:16,190 --> 02:35:19,030
What are you guys looking at?

2315
02:35:22,090 --> 02:35:22,850
Hey team?

2316
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:25,030
Oh I got him!

2317
02:35:28,890 --> 02:35:29,050
Ow.

2318
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:34,220
Where'd he go?

2319
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:38,560
How do I get off the horse?

2320
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:42,920
Wait, I'm gonna save because I haven't in a minute.

2321
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:45,480
Okay, it did.

2322
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,100
Um, oh here we go.

2323
02:35:52,220 --> 02:35:53,300
Oh, this is the thing.

2324
02:35:54,580 --> 02:35:56,580
Here, this memento will do.

2325
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:58,800
But I'm not getting on that horse again.

2326
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:00,780
You'll go get the rest of the memory links.

2327
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:02,440
Okay.

2328
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:05,180
It saves in horse.

2329
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:06,540
It does.

2330
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:08,420
Wait, should I be like clicking around?

2331
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:08,900
Let's see.

2332
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:11,180
Maybe I click on them.

2333
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:14,700
Can I see them again?

2334
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:15,400
Hello!

2335
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:15,880
Hello!

2336
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:16,740
Hello!

2337
02:36:17,340 --> 02:36:17,340
Hello!

2338
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:18,160
Oh I did!

2339
02:36:18,260 --> 02:36:18,620
I got him!

2340
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:19,260
I got him!

2341
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:20,240
Wait, was that everything?

2342
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:23,380
Are you good?

2343
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:25,240
Just hopping a little.

2344
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:29,880
I think I... Was that everything?

2345
02:36:34,970 --> 02:36:37,210
For some reason it's not showing up anymore.

2346
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:43,630
Memento!

2347
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:11,960
I did it!

2348
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:14,700
I just noticed it's a full moon tonight.

2349
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:17,820
Not only is it a full moon tonight, it's a super moon.

2350
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:23,340
Let's activate memento.

2351
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:26,240
Beep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

2352
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:29,540
The super moon.

2353
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:34,480
Whoa, I reached to a child.

2354
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:39,830
Is the diagnosis certain?

2355
02:37:41,130 --> 02:37:44,350
Yes, we've reached a consensus on the results.

2356
02:37:51,970 --> 02:37:58,590
Unfortunately, like many cases of pervasive developmental disorders, this is a rather late diagnosis.

2357
02:37:59,810 --> 02:38:03,370
Why is his head, like, morphed into the chair?

2358
02:38:03,750 --> 02:38:04,550
He's an animorph.

2359
02:38:04,730 --> 02:38:06,750
No, he's a furniture morph.

2360
02:38:07,990 --> 02:38:08,630
Have you ever...

2361
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:14,170
Had you known when you were a child, Miss, it could have saved you a lot of trouble.

2362
02:38:16,630 --> 02:38:18,110
Do you have any books on it?

2363
02:38:19,970 --> 02:38:21,910
This one by Tony Atwood.

2364
02:38:21,970 --> 02:38:24,310
He is one of the specialists on the subject.

2365
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:26,810
You can borrow it free of charge for now.

2366
02:38:27,070 --> 02:38:28,210
Just don't elope with it.

2367
02:38:31,170 --> 02:38:31,550
Thanks, Doc.

2368
02:38:33,690 --> 02:38:35,070
Now, are you two a couple?

2369
02:38:36,850 --> 02:38:40,150
Unmarried and without any other current legal affiliation.

2370
02:38:41,650 --> 02:38:42,470
Yes, I see.

2371
02:38:43,290 --> 02:38:43,730
Free book.

2372
02:38:44,410 --> 02:38:48,830
Well, I could give you a referral to a specialized counselor if you wish.

2373
02:38:49,730 --> 02:38:51,770
Is there anything unsettling in the relationship?

2374
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:53,810
No.

2375
02:38:55,830 --> 02:38:56,570
And you, sir?

2376
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:00,640
No.

2377
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:02,340
It's fine.

2378
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:06,100
He's a little hesitant.

2379
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:09,500
Nonetheless, sir, you should also give the book a read.

2380
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:12,340
It'd help you understand her condition.

2381
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:14,660
I'd rather not.

2382
02:39:14,940 --> 02:39:15,540
Okay.

2383
02:39:19,610 --> 02:39:20,730
Why is that?

2384
02:39:23,710 --> 02:39:25,370
Well, it's your call.

2385
02:39:26,470 --> 02:39:32,490
In the meantime, there's a thing called Equine Therapy that might help her.

2386
02:39:33,130 --> 02:39:34,610
A ranch just north of here offers it.

2387
02:39:34,750 --> 02:39:35,870
I can contact them for you.

2388
02:39:44,210 --> 02:39:47,030
Well, that author is real, so if you know spoils what...

2389
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:48,190
Oh, interesting.

2390
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:54,620
It's terminal.

2391
02:39:56,620 --> 02:39:58,220
The horse girl is terminal.

2392
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:00,060
Told you so.

2393
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:03,520
You can never...

2394
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:05,620
Once you horse girl, you can never stop.

2395
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,060
Excuse me, could you please silence the clock?

2396
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:18,960
The ticking really bothers her.

2397
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:20,920
It's not that severe.

2398
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:21,580
I'll be okay.

2399
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:23,100
No problem.

2400
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:24,420
It's standard policy.

2401
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:27,660
If there's anything at all that makes you uncomfortable, just let me know.

2402
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:33,780
Thank you.

2403
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:37,020
I guess that explains the ones in the house.

2404
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:38,040
Oh yeah!

2405
02:40:40,280 --> 02:40:41,300
I'm also jumping.

2406
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:44,320
Okay, it's the clock.

2407
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:48,940
Nah, that explains the silent clock.

2408
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:53,620
Tony Atwood.

2409
02:40:58,900 --> 02:40:59,020
Hmm.

2410
02:40:59,580 --> 02:40:59,700
Oh.

2411
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:02,640
A plain tawny handbag.

2412
02:41:06,100 --> 02:41:06,780
Aww.

2413
02:41:07,460 --> 02:41:08,380
What else?

2414
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:11,280
Just a bit longer.

2415
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:12,820
They'll be calling for you soon.

2416
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:15,180
Oh, the platypus.

2417
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:19,960
I can't believe this piece of atrocity is dated all the way back here.

2418
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:21,880
Looks like someone took good care of it.

2419
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:23,100
What is just a platypus?

2420
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:24,180
What's wrong with it?

2421
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:28,880
She's still got pretty bad taste in animals, though.

2422
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:30,620
This guy sucks.

2423
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:33,160
This guy sucks.

2424
02:41:38,270 --> 02:41:39,270
Shut up, Neil.

2425
02:41:39,770 --> 02:41:40,710
What do you like?

2426
02:41:41,150 --> 02:41:41,410
Huh?

2427
02:41:42,070 --> 02:41:44,290
Your animal is probably so dumb.

2428
02:41:46,070 --> 02:42:02,680
exist you probably like the dodo bird which is also a good animal but because you like it it sucks no

2429
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:17,060
bully near you can't tell me what to do activate the

2430
02:42:21,690 --> 02:42:26,470
memento oh the movie theater where

2431
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:38,160
we see it hmm Sst, look, I think, oh my gosh, I still am just craving some movie theater popcorn.

2432
02:42:40,040 --> 02:42:43,040
I know, I can't believe he once paid to see this crap in theater.

2433
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:44,860
No, you idiot.

2434
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:46,380
Look, we leaped.

2435
02:42:51,340 --> 02:42:52,960
What's the music so scary for?

2436
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:59,260
Holy overcooked macaroni, the kid's in the theater all by himself.

2437
02:42:59,480 --> 02:43:00,420
What a loser.

2438
02:43:03,440 --> 02:43:04,920
Oh my god.

2439
02:43:10,270 --> 02:43:27,310
He's like the comic relief character in the story You go to the theater all by yourself all the time That's different No one's competent enough to match my taste But that aside How could anyone last through this rubbish?

2440
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:43,130
I go lots of places alone You know how people will be like You shouldn't go eat at a restaurant alone Or anything like that I go all the time.

2441
02:43:43,270 --> 02:43:44,810
Is it really that bad?

2442
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:53,850
And thus, this movie sucks on both physical and metaphysical levels.

2443
02:43:54,250 --> 02:43:55,730
Q-E-Z.

2444
02:43:56,230 --> 02:43:57,410
Cheating enough.

2445
02:43:58,150 --> 02:43:59,330
Come on, let's go.

2446
02:43:59,890 --> 02:44:00,030
What?

2447
02:44:00,170 --> 02:44:00,590
Oh, right.

2448
02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:05,250
Why is the music so scary?

2449
02:44:07,630 --> 02:44:08,910
It's, like, so dramatic.

2450
02:44:08,910 --> 02:44:13,450
Oh, I could just grab that person.

2451
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:16,150
Whoa, wait.

2452
02:44:16,470 --> 02:44:18,350
I ain't talking to no emo teenager.

2453
02:44:19,170 --> 02:44:20,430
Grammar, my dear Watson.

2454
02:44:21,490 --> 02:44:21,850
Shut up.

2455
02:44:22,130 --> 02:44:23,250
It's not even a full sentence.

2456
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:30,310
I feel weird going places alone, but that's because I have a wife.

2457
02:44:31,450 --> 02:44:32,390
Stop bragging.

2458
02:44:33,910 --> 02:44:37,110
AMC theaters, pre-pop bags plus Orville poured over oil.

2459
02:44:37,450 --> 02:44:38,330
It calls you.

2460
02:44:38,910 --> 02:44:39,370
I know!

2461
02:44:39,590 --> 02:44:40,510
I gotta get it!

2462
02:44:41,070 --> 02:44:42,370
Let's look for the mementos.

2463
02:44:43,270 --> 02:44:45,030
Oh, so we're almost to, like, baby.

2464
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:50,560
Actually...

2465
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:50,880
Oh.

2466
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:53,940
Huh?

2467
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:57,520
I'm grabbing the people.

2468
02:44:57,720 --> 02:44:58,320
What are you doing?

2469
02:44:58,980 --> 02:45:00,920
That's the third person you've removed here.

2470
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:03,040
Eh, it's not like it's permanent.

2471
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:08,140
Did I ever have an emo phase?

2472
02:45:08,260 --> 02:45:08,800
I did!

2473
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:10,680
I did, actually.

2474
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:14,000
I was like...

2475
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,020
I had like a scene...

2476
02:45:16,020 --> 02:45:18,120
I didn't do like the...

2477
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:19,300
What do you call it?

2478
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:20,700
Like the raccoon hair.

2479
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:23,100
But I had like a scene haircut.

2480
02:45:25,320 --> 02:45:25,860
And...

2481
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:28,380
You know, all that stuff.

2482
02:45:30,020 --> 02:45:31,000
Where are the memories?

2483
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:34,980
I was an emo...

2484
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:36,760
I was an emo kid for a bit.

2485
02:45:40,010 --> 02:45:41,290
Not the bathrooms.

2486
02:45:43,770 --> 02:45:45,290
It was a phase.

2487
02:45:48,350 --> 02:45:50,110
It was, yeah, it was a phase.

2488
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:55,090
You know that poking them out of the way like that does nothing, right?

2489
02:45:55,650 --> 02:45:56,450
Then why complain?

2490
02:45:57,490 --> 02:46:00,390
Why can't I just erase people's existence?

2491
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:07,100
Getting stood up?

2492
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:08,780
Now that's a Kodak moment.

2493
02:46:10,500 --> 02:46:12,160
You relate well with your kin, I see.

2494
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:16,960
Um...

2495
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:21,880
Aw, poor guy got stood up!

2496
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:29,680
I don't know if I'm supposed to remove all the people, so I just will.

2497
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:34,060
Oh look, this place is all empty and creepy now.

2498
02:46:34,460 --> 02:46:35,180
I hope you're happy.

2499
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:37,100
Oh, come here.

2500
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:46,280
Uh...

2501
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:49,220
Oh, I made it really creepy.

2502
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:53,220
Wait, I made it weird.

2503
02:46:54,620 --> 02:46:56,680
I want to construct him a lady friend.

2504
02:46:57,220 --> 02:46:59,160
Can we construct a lady friend for him, Eva?

2505
02:46:59,980 --> 02:47:00,180
No.

2506
02:47:00,820 --> 02:47:01,020
Aw.

2507
02:47:09,470 --> 02:47:09,890
Creepy!

2508
02:47:10,930 --> 02:47:11,290
Wait.

2509
02:47:12,490 --> 02:47:13,430
There's something still here?

2510
02:47:13,670 --> 02:47:13,850
No.

2511
02:47:16,910 --> 02:47:18,450
Construct me a lady friend.

2512
02:47:18,650 --> 02:47:19,550
Wait, do I have to get rid of...

2513
02:47:19,550 --> 02:47:19,830
Wait.

2514
02:47:20,570 --> 02:47:21,590
Well, there's nothing here.

2515
02:47:22,970 --> 02:47:26,350
I hate to say it, but I guess I have to nag something out of him again.

2516
02:47:26,890 --> 02:47:27,550
All yours.

2517
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:29,670
At least there's no olives this time.

2518
02:47:33,030 --> 02:47:33,750
Okay, okay.

2519
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:36,490
I thought I was going to have to get rid of all the people in the theater too.

2520
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:45,260
Wait, is this how they meet?

2521
02:47:52,540 --> 02:47:52,840
River?

2522
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:56,080
You were in there this whole time?

2523
02:47:56,240 --> 02:47:56,860
Oh, okay.

2524
02:47:59,060 --> 02:48:00,340
I waited for you at the lobby.

2525
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:01,400
I thought you didn't come.

2526
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:04,800
Why did you leave?

2527
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:06,740
I thought we were watching the movie together.

2528
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:07,880
Huh?

2529
02:48:08,180 --> 02:48:10,100
I'm the one who should ask that.

2530
02:48:11,140 --> 02:48:12,080
What do you mean?

2531
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,340
We were watching the movie together and then you left.

2532
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:16,220
We weren't watching it together.

2533
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:17,680
I didn't even know where you were.

2534
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:20,480
If you saw me in there, why didn't you come and find me?

2535
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:22,800
What difference does it make?

2536
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:26,000
We were watching the same movie in the same room.

2537
02:48:27,580 --> 02:48:27,780
Ah.

2538
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:32,500
Of common, silly misunderstanding.

2539
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:36,380
What's wrong?

2540
02:48:37,380 --> 02:48:38,880
You're so weird.

2541
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:53,420
cute do you not want to watch the movie together anymore of course I do come let's head back in before it ends aww what a weirdo

2542
02:49:00,250 --> 02:49:03,510
how it took till adulthood to figure it out I don't know

2543
02:49:06,810 --> 02:49:08,350
she's just quirky

2544
02:49:12,330 --> 02:49:15,010
I feel like I I should make a clever remark.

2545
02:49:15,890 --> 02:49:16,930
You feel wrong.

2546
02:49:18,010 --> 02:49:20,710
Well, let's hope our ride's waiting for us in there.

2547
02:49:22,690 --> 02:49:23,990
Hold on, let me drink some more tea.

2548
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:32,940
There were no signs.

2549
02:49:37,180 --> 02:49:37,600
Oh.

2550
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:39,780
Oh, it's the platypus again, probably.

2551
02:49:42,020 --> 02:49:43,980
I want to know what the movie is.

2552
02:49:55,470 --> 02:49:56,250
Whoa.

2553
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:02,080
Uh.

2554
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:04,780
Wait.

2555
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:06,240
Five moves.

2556
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,960
Okay, I got it.

2557
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:15,700
Easy peasy.

2558
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:19,080
The Minecraft movie.

2559
02:50:20,940 --> 02:50:21,740
They should have stayed.

2560
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:23,180
They would see...

2561
02:50:23,180 --> 02:50:24,200
What was it called?

2562
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:25,720
What was the...

2563
02:50:25,720 --> 02:50:27,420
The man sandwich or whatever.

2564
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:31,200
You shouldn't go to restaurants alone?

2565
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:32,760
You should go with me instead?

2566
02:50:33,460 --> 02:50:35,440
I was driving, so this is a bit late.

2567
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:40,080
Well, where would you want to go?

2568
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:43,660
You know, I think this platypus is growing on me.

2569
02:50:44,300 --> 02:50:46,920
Mostly just for convenience, but hey.

2570
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:56,160
Oh.

2571
02:50:57,440 --> 02:50:58,160
Where, baby?

2572
02:51:02,580 --> 02:51:04,200
I've been craving spaghetti.

2573
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:07,600
Come on, dude, grow some balls.

2574
02:51:12,140 --> 02:51:13,160
It's not that.

2575
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:15,220
Look, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

2576
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:16,480
Oh, sheesh.

2577
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:17,640
What could possibly happen?

2578
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:20,440
Um.

2579
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:23,820
Just think about it.

2580
02:51:23,900 --> 02:51:25,540
Worst case scenario, she says no.

2581
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:27,980
You strut on like nothing happened.

2582
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:31,640
No one will know and everyone will still think you're cool.

2583
02:51:32,620 --> 02:51:33,900
What if she tells someone?

2584
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:36,040
Or yells at me.

2585
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:37,480
Don't be a little wuss.

2586
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:41,520
Or says yes, but really means no.

2587
02:51:42,580 --> 02:51:43,400
Quit worrying.

2588
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:47,800
Quit worrying.

2589
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:47,800
Oh,

2590
02:51:51,440 --> 02:51:52,200
quit worrying.

2591
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:52,380
Quit worrying.

2592
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:54,440
Who would do that?

2593
02:51:58,500 --> 02:52:01,860
And what if she throws an encyclopedia in my face?

2594
02:52:03,560 --> 02:52:06,080
Can you guys tell I wasn't the cool one in school?

2595
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:10,440
I don't even have a helmet.

2596
02:52:10,840 --> 02:52:12,820
Dear Lord, I'm so not prepared for this.

2597
02:52:15,340 --> 02:52:16,860
Dude, don't panic.

2598
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:28,580
Just straighten your spine and quit being a little wuss.

2599
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:30,820
Dude, I have scoliosis.

2600
02:52:31,140 --> 02:52:32,580
I can't straighten my spine.

2601
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:34,300
Yeah, you tell him.

2602
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:36,380
Everything will be all right.

2603
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:37,700
around.

2604
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:38,520
Okay.

2605
02:52:39,620 --> 02:52:40,060
Okay.

2606
02:52:41,620 --> 02:52:43,320
Hey, what are you?

2607
02:52:43,580 --> 02:52:45,920
Just let it happen.

2608
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:46,840
Let it happen.

2609
02:52:51,690 --> 02:52:52,390
Hello.

2610
02:52:56,760 --> 02:52:57,460
Hello.

2611
02:52:59,120 --> 02:52:59,870
Can you hear me?

2612
02:53:01,180 --> 02:53:01,880
Yes.

2613
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:04,940
Then why didn't you?

2614
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:06,040
Never mind.

2615
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:10,560
Takai, thank you.

2616
02:53:10,860 --> 02:53:11,120

Aw, um, say, you want to go catch a movie together sometime?

2619
02:54:27,690 --> 02:54:29,210
She looks so nervous.

2620
02:54:29,410 --> 02:54:29,670
It's cute.

2621
02:54:29,970 --> 02:54:30,590
I don't know.

2622
02:54:31,210 --> 02:54:31,590
That's okay.

2623
02:54:31,990 --> 02:54:33,270
I'll give you time to consider it.

2624
02:54:33,890 --> 02:54:34,590
I can't.

2625
02:54:35,190 --> 02:54:35,590
Why?

2626
02:54:37,130 --> 02:54:38,530
There's no date or time.

2627
02:54:39,630 --> 02:54:42,190
Oh, um, how about this Saturday at 8?

2628
02:54:42,570 --> 02:54:44,950
He just knows the movie time off the top of his head.

2629
02:55:00,550 --> 02:55:01,030
Ugh.

2630
02:55:01,770 --> 02:55:19,960
I think the system froze yes oh great never mind I guess we'll work out the details later river um I'll just

2632
02:55:37,630 --> 02:55:40,550
Thank you for your brave confession, Green Bear.

2633
02:55:42,030 --> 02:55:42,630
Thank you!

2634
02:55:46,060 --> 02:55:49,480
You think I'm gonna call out how utterly awkward that was?

2635
02:55:51,980 --> 02:55:52,880
Well, just forget it.

2636
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:55,000
I'm not giving into your expectations.

2637
02:55:56,260 --> 02:55:56,960
Give him a break.

2638
02:55:57,160 --> 02:55:58,280
He was still just a kid.

2639
02:55:59,380 --> 02:56:00,620
You of all people should relate.

2640
02:56:02,200 --> 02:56:03,240
What's that supposed to mean?

2641
02:56:07,320 --> 02:56:08,260
Shut up and go.

2642
02:56:09,640 --> 02:56:10,440
my name, you know.

2643
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:14,740
That stuffed platypus.

2644
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:17,760
Well, I suppose if you look at it from the right angle...

2645
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:17,980
No.

2646
02:56:18,460 --> 02:56:18,920
Not really.

2647
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:19,760
Never mind.

2648
02:56:20,460 --> 02:56:21,220
Such a hater.

2649
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:23,460
She put the book up.

2650
02:56:23,560 --> 02:56:24,180
It's so cute.

2651
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:27,740
What the heck were you doing in there, dude?

2652
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:28,860
What?

2653
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:29,960
I asked her out.

2654
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:32,560
No.

2655
02:56:32,800 --> 02:56:33,980
That was pathetic.

2656
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:35,240
Why were you?

2657
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:37,820
I would have just barged in there and be all like...

2658
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:38,240
Hey!

2659
02:56:38,620 --> 02:56:39,040

2662
02:57:15,400 --> 02:57:16,420
You know the answer.

2663
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:17,740
I know you know the answer.

2664
02:57:19,380 --> 02:57:20,420
We're waiting, River.

2665
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:23,420
Fine.

2666
02:57:24,760 --> 02:57:36,220
Oh, he made sale on August 3rd of 1492 from the Spanish city of Palos de la Frontera, which was founded in 1322 and granted to Alvar Perez de Guzman.

2667
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:38,980
Sorry, my horrible white accent.

2668
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:42,140
It was at the mere age of 14 She didn't buy the...

2669
02:57:42,140 --> 02:57:42,720
Okay, okay.

2670
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:44,040
I only asked for the date.

2671
02:57:47,440 --> 02:57:47,840
But see?

2672
02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:49,120
Was that so hard?

2673
02:57:51,100 --> 02:57:51,820
Guzman.

2674
02:57:53,060 --> 02:57:53,780
Guzman.

2675
02:57:54,980 --> 02:57:55,520
Good lord.

2676
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:58,620
Does everyone with her condition have near-photographic memory?

2677
02:57:59,000 --> 02:57:59,280
What?

2678
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:00,420
They're so mean.

2679
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:01,820
Not really.

2680
02:58:02,360 --> 02:58:03,300
Though I think their...

2681
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:04,800
Rote?

2682
02:58:05,380 --> 02:58:08,280
Rote memory is often fairly strong.

2683
02:58:12,020 --> 02:58:12,740
Ghostly.

2684
02:58:12,760 --> 02:58:13,720
Yeah?

2685
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:15,640
Is there a problem?

2686
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:21,640
Psst, she's coming this way.

2687
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:23,520
Altab, Altab!

2688
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:29,080
What are they doing?

2689
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:31,520
Altab 4, Altab 4!

2690
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:38,380
What are they doing on the school computers?

2691
02:58:40,360 --> 02:58:41,040
Locked.

2692
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:43,600
Cafeteria only open during lunch hours.

2693
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:45,700
Scatter.

2694
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:46,360
Scaddle.

2695
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:47,020
Scuddle.

2696
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:47,800
Whoa, P.E.

2697
02:58:48,060 --> 02:58:48,820
That's a rep.

2698
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:52,000
You chumps better be better next time.

2699
02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:54,280
An atrium.

2700
02:58:54,820 --> 02:58:56,120
We could use this place later.

2701
02:58:57,360 --> 02:59:02,200
I just can't believe that these court lines are rectangles in his head.

2702
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:06,100
Is that a problem?

2703
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:10,780
I'm going to get rid of this guy.

2704
02:59:11,400 --> 02:59:12,580
Oh, it worked.

2705
02:59:25,670 --> 02:59:27,330
They're round normally, are they?

2706
02:59:28,950 --> 02:59:29,410
Fine.

2707
02:59:29,770 --> 02:59:30,250
You win.

2708
02:59:31,250 --> 02:59:31,710
Booyah!

2709
02:59:33,350 --> 02:59:34,650
Okay, one more.

2710
02:59:34,950 --> 02:59:35,510
One more.

2711
02:59:37,970 --> 02:59:38,790
I think it was...

2712
02:59:38,790 --> 02:59:40,430
Oh, gosh, they went so fast.

2713
02:59:40,930 --> 02:59:42,250
Limitations with RPG Maker.

2714
02:59:42,390 --> 02:59:43,250
Oh, that makes sense.

2715
02:59:43,990 --> 02:59:44,390
Oh, wait!

2716
02:59:45,030 --> 02:59:45,710
Oh, go back.

2717
02:59:46,310 --> 02:59:49,010
Okay, well, I missed something in the other room.

2718
02:59:49,250 --> 02:59:51,510
I didn't see them in the art room or whatever it was.

2719
02:59:59,390 --> 02:59:59,750
Booyah.

2720
03:00:01,290 --> 03:00:03,290
Yeah, she's unique, but she's unique.

2721
03:00:03,310 --> 03:00:33,650
boring I mean just look at her she's so cute what are you talking about she just sits there by herself all day with that creepy deformed duck toy it's not a deformed duck that's a platypus what the heck's a platypus quit making words up you're in middle school and you don't know what a okay Anyway,

2722
03:00:33,850 --> 03:00:36,110
she's just so off, you know?

2723
03:00:37,290 --> 03:00:39,730
It's like she's from a totally different planet or something.

2724
03:00:40,970 --> 03:00:42,410
I know, isn't that cool?

2725
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:43,410
Aww.

2726
03:00:44,330 --> 03:00:46,790
If you're into aliens and that sort of stuff, I guess.

2727
03:00:46,890 --> 03:00:51,930
Oh my gosh, Johnny grew up to become, like, totally into monster girls.

2728
03:00:54,810 --> 03:00:55,210
Alien.

2729
03:00:55,650 --> 03:00:56,750
Why does she alien?

2730
03:00:59,950 --> 03:01:03,290
But really, if you want to be weird, why don't you go hang with the aliens?

2731
03:01:03,310 --> 03:01:04,430
and goths.

2732
03:01:05,470 --> 03:01:07,410
Well, for one, I don't want to ruin my hair.

2733
03:01:08,250 --> 03:01:10,870
The fact that we got a name for them says a lot, too.

2734
03:01:12,510 --> 03:01:13,250
Look, Nick.

2735
03:01:15,090 --> 03:01:15,890
I just...

2736
03:01:16,370 --> 03:01:20,330
I just don't want to be another typical kid in a sea of typical people.

2737
03:01:22,550 --> 03:01:24,910
But how the heck would be in with her change your own identity?

2738
03:01:26,310 --> 03:01:30,370
I mean, you'd just be some guy who hangs out with a shy girl.

2739
03:01:31,190 --> 03:01:32,470
She's not just shy, Nick.

2740
03:01:33,410 --> 03:01:35,310
There's something strange about her.

2741
03:01:38,510 --> 03:01:40,270
Being strange isn't always a good thing, you know.

2742
03:01:42,350 --> 03:01:45,290
Do you even know if she wants to be different?

2743
03:01:46,050 --> 03:01:48,130
Maybe she just wants to fit in like everyone else.

2744
03:01:50,750 --> 03:01:54,090
And if she does, pushing her the other way wouldn't help, would it?

2745
03:01:55,570 --> 03:01:58,450
Look, Nick, the point is that I know what I need.

2746
03:01:58,810 --> 03:01:59,870
Oh my gosh.

2747
03:02:01,250 --> 03:02:03,290
And she is the one who has it.

2748
03:02:04,350 --> 03:02:04,850
Wow.

2749
03:02:05,870 --> 03:02:06,890
It's such a young age.

2750
03:02:07,010 --> 03:02:08,270
He knew what he wanted.

2751
03:02:11,750 --> 03:02:14,590
So you want her for what she has, but not for her.

2752
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:18,470
That's cold, man.

2753
03:02:22,030 --> 03:02:23,210
Is this what he told her?

2754
03:02:24,690 --> 03:02:26,610
Why he got with her or whatever?

2755
03:02:26,890 --> 03:02:28,110
That made her really upset.

2756
03:02:36,080 --> 03:02:37,780
I just hope you know what you're doing.

2757
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:39,880
I do.

2758
03:02:41,680 --> 03:02:43,380
I think you're wrong, though.

2759
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:46,240
People aren't that typical.

2760
03:02:46,720 --> 03:02:47,960
Everyone's unique in some way.

2761
03:02:49,900 --> 03:02:51,920
That's just what grandma's telling you.

2762
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:57,200
So he liked the idea of her.

2763
03:02:57,320 --> 03:02:58,480
He didn't like her.

2764
03:02:59,640 --> 03:03:00,960
And that made her really upset.

2765
03:03:01,660 --> 03:03:05,700
Wait, so this guy is some kind of human hogging hipster?

2766
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:09,840
That's sort of disturbing.

2767
03:03:10,900 --> 03:03:15,200
You You know, sometimes I want to slap our clients upside the head.

2768
03:03:16,120 --> 03:03:16,760
It's high school.

2769
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:18,680
Everyone's a- Oh, I thought they were in middle school.

2770
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:20,300
Everyone's a bastard.

2771
03:03:21,540 --> 03:03:23,100
But hey, welcome to the club.

2772
03:03:25,700 --> 03:03:26,420
It is weird.

2773
03:03:27,220 --> 03:03:31,580
Wait, so also, if she did want to fit in, he was just like, no, you're going to be hanging out with me.

2774
03:03:32,620 --> 03:03:35,860
Wait, so this is what he told her about at the cliff.

2775
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:37,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2776
03:03:43,660 --> 03:03:46,740
Oh my god, that makes it even worse that he didn't know what a platypus was.

2777
03:03:49,580 --> 03:03:52,080
He's in high school and didn't know.

2778
03:03:54,660 --> 03:03:56,600
He didn't want to read the doctor's pamphlet too.

2779
03:03:56,760 --> 03:03:58,640
Yeah, he just kind of was like.

2780
03:04:00,420 --> 03:04:01,860
He like rejected it.

2781
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:04,620
I suppose so.

2782
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:08,260
She then went cuckoo and began making those creepy rabbits, right?

2783
03:04:09,860 --> 03:04:12,960
Because he confessed this from who knows how long ago?

2784
03:04:14,300 --> 03:04:16,240
I guess she's pretty good at holding a grudge.

2785
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:19,800
Cool a James, ain't you?

2786
03:04:20,300 --> 03:04:21,300
I'm not buying it.

2787
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:22,800
Something feels missing.

2788
03:04:24,340 --> 03:04:25,720
Then go get a hat, Sherlock.

2789
03:04:29,700 --> 03:04:32,600
Come on, I think our passport's leaning against the table there.

2790
03:04:40,330 --> 03:04:41,250
Strange situation.

2791
03:04:41,470 --> 03:04:45,450
I'm envious that this kid was still there to help him move pianos when their hair grew.

2792
03:04:45,770 --> 03:04:48,810
I wish I was still in contact with my childhood friends.

2793
03:04:53,320 --> 03:04:54,300
Stuffed toy platypus.

2794
03:04:54,460 --> 03:04:57,500
I just love how every time we see this thing, we guarantee a free memory link.

2795
03:04:58,260 --> 03:04:59,720
It must have left a big...

2796
03:04:59,720 --> 03:05:02,560
Left as big of a scar on his mind as it did on mine.

2797
03:05:04,880 --> 03:05:08,800
Reasons and intents aside, it's pretty remarkable that they actually met in high school.

2798
03:05:09,540 --> 03:05:12,540
How many of those go on for more than a month nowadays, huh?

2799
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:15,400
I don't know about you, but mine went pretty swimmingly.

2800
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:16,280
Yeah?

2801
03:05:16,820 --> 03:05:19,020
So swimmingly, it swam right out the window.

2802
03:05:19,880 --> 03:05:20,680
Sounds about right.

2803
03:05:21,240 --> 03:05:23,120
Literal high school sweethearts?

2804
03:05:23,620 --> 03:05:24,580
Is what they call them.

2805
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:33,060
Should I even?

2806
03:05:33,820 --> 03:05:34,200
No need.

2807
03:05:34,320 --> 03:05:35,020
I'm all good now.

2808
03:05:40,690 --> 03:05:41,070
Kame!

2809
03:05:42,390 --> 03:05:43,850
Oh, for walnuts' sake.

2810
03:05:44,610 --> 03:05:44,790
Kame!

2811
03:05:46,430 --> 03:05:46,730
Hey.

2812
03:05:48,690 --> 03:05:49,710
Not cool, Eva.

2813
03:05:51,650 --> 03:05:56,070
You never block someone in the middle of a Kamehameha.

2814
03:05:57,350 --> 03:05:57,910
What?

2815
03:06:00,620 --> 03:06:02,160
She's such a loser.

2816
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:24,040
what's wrong with him don't ever interrupt a man's kamehameha

2817
03:06:27,580 --> 03:06:30,740

It hit me.

2824
03:07:30,340 --> 03:07:30,800
It hit me.

2825
03:07:31,120 --> 03:07:32,720
It was so easy.

2826
03:07:34,280 --> 03:07:36,700
For some reason, my brains just stopped computing.

2827
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:38,840
Okay, we're good.

2828
03:07:41,100 --> 03:07:42,260
It's right there.

2829
03:07:42,360 --> 03:07:42,800
I know!

2830
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:45,180
For some reason, my brain stopped computing.

2831
03:07:49,260 --> 03:07:50,920
Are we at Baby Johnny now?

2832
03:08:00,790 --> 03:08:02,670
I'm going to school now, ma.

2833
03:08:03,550 --> 03:08:04,990
Have a nice day, Joey.

2834
03:08:07,710 --> 03:08:09,550
My baby boy.

2835
03:08:10,210 --> 03:08:11,070
Growing up so fast.

2836
03:08:15,890 --> 03:08:18,090
Ghost brain to ethereal at times.

2837
03:08:18,370 --> 03:08:19,350
It must be it.

2838
03:08:21,490 --> 03:08:22,690
That must be it.

2839
03:08:25,780 --> 03:08:27,280
What if he was a girl?

2840
03:08:27,960 --> 03:08:30,160
Would she still nickname him after his grandpa?

2841
03:08:31,460 --> 03:08:34,400
It wouldn't be that bad, actually, since it ends in A.

2842
03:08:36,040 --> 03:08:36,560
Joey.

2843
03:08:37,480 --> 03:08:37,940
Joey.

2844
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:38,900
Julie.

2845
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:40,140
Sounds cute.

2846
03:08:41,360 --> 03:08:43,740
If it sounds so cute, why don't you marry him?

2847
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:45,320
What is this?

2848
03:08:46,900 --> 03:08:47,480
Ayy.

2849
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:48,520
Ah, jealous?

2850
03:08:49,280 --> 03:08:50,960
Oh yes, so jealous.

2851
03:08:53,040 --> 03:08:55,100
The clicking clock.

2852
03:08:55,780 --> 03:08:59,220
To be fair, a ticking clock is pretty annoying indeed.

2853
03:09:01,580 --> 03:09:02,740
I don't think it's that annoying.

2854
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:05,880
Let's go into his room.

2855
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:07,260
But can I go in through here?

2856
03:09:08,080 --> 03:09:08,520
Yes.

2857
03:09:09,240 --> 03:09:10,840
This is how he...

2858
03:09:11,240 --> 03:09:12,880
Oh, the soccer ball, okay?

2859
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:16,240
I cannot get a grasp of like the...

2860
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:23,040
I guess... I'm gonna guess that like this era is like 2011, because that's when the game came out or whatever.

2861
03:09:24,780 --> 03:09:26,240
And then the future...

2862
03:09:26,860 --> 03:09:28,500
is like the distant future.

2863
03:09:29,260 --> 03:09:30,860
Various books with smudge titles.

2864
03:09:36,470 --> 03:09:38,350
Oh yeah, okay, it's so slippery.

2865
03:09:40,950 --> 03:09:41,470
Okay.

2866
03:09:42,290 --> 03:09:43,490
Oh, the olives.

2867
03:09:45,010 --> 03:09:46,470
Oh, bleh, not again.

2868
03:09:47,050 --> 03:09:48,550
Glass bottle of pickled...

2869
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:49,310
Cucumbers!

2870
03:09:49,930 --> 03:09:51,730
Holy crap, my mind's totally blown!

2871
03:09:52,790 --> 03:09:54,610
You're pretty easily impressed.

2872
03:09:57,010 --> 03:09:58,430
Yeah, he does have a bunk bed.

2873
03:09:59,510 --> 03:09:59,630
Hmm.

2874
03:10:01,050 --> 03:10:01,610
Curious.

2875
03:10:09,770 --> 03:10:10,770
Memento prepare.

2876
03:10:26,840 --> 03:10:28,540
See, this one didn't...

2877
03:10:28,540 --> 03:10:30,600
This one didn't confuse me.

2878
03:10:32,700 --> 03:10:33,860
I got it.

2879
03:10:38,020 --> 03:10:40,080
Walk then, you know me.

2880
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:49,480
Suckerball?

2881
03:10:50,480 --> 03:10:50,720
Whoa.

2882
03:10:51,400 --> 03:10:52,300
Whoa, where are they?

2883
03:10:53,920 --> 03:10:55,600
Ack, it smells like roadkill again.

2884
03:10:56,800 --> 03:10:57,300
Where are we?

2885
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:58,740
I like how he says, ack.

2886
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:01,580
Eva?

2887
03:11:04,280 --> 03:11:05,640
What the hell is that?

2888
03:11:13,660 --> 03:11:14,040
Huh?

2889
03:11:22,580 --> 03:11:23,740
What is this?

2890
03:11:29,320 --> 03:11:30,920
That's his next memory.

2891
03:11:32,200 --> 03:11:34,920
Yeah, but why is it going lapida on us?

2892
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:36,580
I don't know.

2893
03:11:37,140 --> 03:11:39,700
It's not just linking the memories together for construction.

2894
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:44,420
There must be a malfunction within the machine's ADG.

2895
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:48,780
I thought the last fix was foolproof for another half a year.

2896
03:11:50,440 --> 03:11:52,540
I can't believe those idiots in the maintenance department.

2897
03:11:53,780 --> 03:11:55,080
Yeah, castle in the sky.

2898
03:11:57,900 --> 03:12:00,020
We've already gotten the teenage years saved.

2899
03:12:02,840 --> 03:12:04,460
We might still be able to do this.

2900
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:12,140
Alright, but I ain't telling him about this.

2901
03:12:15,140 --> 03:12:16,140
As long as we succeed.

2902
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:17,720
He doesn't have to know.

2903
03:12:21,820 --> 03:12:23,880
Well, I guess this is it.

2904
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:25,640
There's nothing we can do here.

2905
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:29,640
Ready to finalize before activation?

2906
03:12:30,880 --> 03:12:31,360
Okay.

2907
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:33,040
Ladies first.

2908
03:12:43,170 --> 03:12:44,630
What a shame.

2909
03:12:44,970 --> 03:12:46,510
I was actually looking forward to it.

2910
03:12:51,700 --> 03:12:54,360
For Spanish speakers, Lapido sounds pretty bad.

2911
03:12:54,580 --> 03:12:54,860
I know.

2912
03:12:55,060 --> 03:12:55,960
I've heard that before.

2913
03:12:58,460 --> 03:12:59,400
Act two.

2914
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:01,420
Billions of lighthouses.

2915
03:13:03,120 --> 03:13:04,940
Stuck at the far end of the sky.

2916
03:13:05,180 --> 03:13:06,440
How many acts are there?

2917
03:13:09,880 --> 03:13:11,320
Well, this is the halfway point.

2918
03:13:14,240 --> 03:13:14,720
Three.

2919
03:13:15,240 --> 03:13:15,420
Okay.

2920
03:13:20,570 --> 03:13:21,510
Don't disturb them.

2921
03:13:24,070 --> 03:13:26,910
They might not wake easily, but they need the concentration.

2922
03:13:47,740 --> 03:13:48,460
Well, they're back to him.

2923
03:13:50,920 --> 03:13:52,740
And that's all this old fool knows.

2924
03:13:53,760 --> 03:13:55,000
Sorry, I can't be more of help.

2925
03:13:56,940 --> 03:13:58,040
It's been three hours.

2926
03:14:00,520 --> 03:14:01,840
Then that'll have to be enough.

2927
03:14:03,740 --> 03:14:36,900
all that's left to do is linking your registered desire to go to the moon to your early memories then we'll pull the switch and voila you'll be on the moon in no time I have a question if you could make Lily disappear that means you can alter this world then can you not simply make things happen and fulfill my wish here and now yeah i was wondering that too why they have to go through like all of this

2928
03:14:40,380 --> 03:15:04,340
i'll save i won't let me save until i move around it would work if there were if this were one of your true set of memories what do you mean what is this then what am i this is just a copy the canvas for us to work with if you will as for you you are merely an algorithm traced from Why?

2929
03:15:07,400 --> 03:15:10,680
Enough to reflect his likeness, but far from complete.

2930
03:15:13,500 --> 03:15:16,620
All we can do is prepare this canvas in a logically consistent way.

2931
03:15:17,540 --> 03:15:26,200
And then, when we transfer your registered desire to your childhood, the machine will generate your new life, one where the desire dictates your behavior.

2932
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:28,280
The goal of an NPC!

2933
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:34,120
The result of that would then be written to the real world.

2934
03:15:34,140 --> 03:16:03,490
John so you see even if we satisfy you you are merely a red only read only program he's AI he's a ghost in the machine he is oh my god I mean we could reset you over and over again and that's enough oh don't be so sensitive it's It's not real, you know.

2935
03:16:04,030 --> 03:16:07,550
But if you truly believe that, why did you even care to explain?

2936
03:16:10,250 --> 03:16:11,530
This is so sad!

2937
03:16:11,950 --> 03:16:13,490
I'm just trying to save time.

2938
03:16:15,030 --> 03:16:15,730
Let's go.

2939
03:16:21,870 --> 03:16:22,470
Doctor.

2940
03:16:25,090 --> 03:16:27,050
Is that what I truly am?

2941
03:16:33,080 --> 03:16:35,360
Couldn't even grace him with an answer!

2942
03:16:38,380 --> 03:16:39,960
Oh my god!

2943
03:16:41,380 --> 03:16:44,840
What the heck is going on in here?

2944
03:16:46,100 --> 03:16:47,660
Ah, all of our nights work.

2945
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:55,160
Whoa.

2946
03:16:56,400 --> 03:17:01,900
Oh, so like each, like, old man and teenager, they each have their own four.

2947
03:17:02,240 --> 03:17:03,100
Oh, and interesting.

2948
03:17:04,660 --> 03:17:05,860
Whoa, what's that over there?

2949
03:17:06,620 --> 03:17:07,480
What's that over there?

2950
03:17:08,540 --> 03:17:09,060
Interesting.

2951
03:17:09,520 --> 03:17:09,900
What the?

2952
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:12,280
He became you guys.

2953
03:17:13,440 --> 03:17:14,460
He's a wisp.

2954
03:17:14,920 --> 03:17:15,300
What the?

2955
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:18,140
At least give me a warning first.

2956
03:17:19,100 --> 03:17:19,680
What can I say?

2957
03:17:20,020 --> 03:17:21,320
I like being ahead.

2958
03:17:21,620 --> 03:17:23,640
But ask if that's a pun.

2959
03:17:24,060 --> 03:17:25,660
But I'm afraid you'd say yes.

2960
03:17:28,320 --> 03:17:29,520
Let's do this fast.

2961
03:17:29,620 --> 03:17:32,280
I feel silly enough in this form as it is.

2962
03:17:32,820 --> 03:17:36,340
All we need to do is pass his desire from the latest memory to the earliest.

2963
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:39,640
Okay, hold on.

2964
03:17:45,430 --> 03:17:47,030
They're so silly looking.

2965
03:17:49,410 --> 03:17:49,870
Okay.

2966
03:17:51,770 --> 03:17:55,510
Line up two matching mementos on the edges to transfer the registered desire.

2967
03:17:57,110 --> 03:17:59,570
Uh, does the bunny count, I guess?

2968
03:18:03,930 --> 03:18:06,050
Do I have to do it with this one too, then?

2969
03:18:14,680 --> 03:18:15,500
Like that?

2970
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:22,300
Uh, the book?

2971
03:18:24,060 --> 03:18:25,400
Hey, Eva, check this out!

2972
03:18:26,800 --> 03:18:28,380
Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom.

2973
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:31,640
The first one isn't connected.

2974
03:18:31,780 --> 03:18:32,140
Yeah.

2975
03:18:34,260 --> 03:18:35,060
Hold on.

2976
03:18:36,020 --> 03:18:36,940
Because I had to move it.

2977
03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:41,800
Would it be connected to the...

2978
03:18:41,800 --> 03:18:42,840
Oh, the...

2979
03:18:42,840 --> 03:18:44,260
Oh, I see, I see.

2980
03:18:51,530 --> 03:18:53,690
But then what would this be connected to?

2981
03:18:59,430 --> 03:18:59,830
Unless...

2982
03:19:00,310 --> 03:19:01,170
Ah, there we go.

2983
03:19:01,250 --> 03:19:01,350
Okay.

2984
03:19:01,450 --> 03:19:02,150
Oh, I see.

2985
03:19:02,230 --> 03:19:03,810
It actually, okay, it forms the connection.

2986
03:19:04,330 --> 03:19:04,470
Okay.

2987
03:19:05,330 --> 03:19:06,070
I'm silly.

2988
03:19:06,390 --> 03:19:07,670
So I had the right idea.

2989
03:19:08,010 --> 03:19:08,850
I just was wrong.

2990
03:19:09,050 --> 03:19:09,710
A little bit.

2991
03:19:11,770 --> 03:19:13,070
This, though.

2992
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:16,850
Is it the...

2993
03:19:20,520 --> 03:19:22,140
Oh, the book!

2994
03:19:22,800 --> 03:19:23,120
Wait.

2995
03:19:27,180 --> 03:19:27,660
What?

2996
03:19:33,670 --> 03:19:36,050
You can rotate after the connection.

2997
03:19:37,790 --> 03:19:38,210
Okay.

2998
03:19:41,030 --> 03:19:42,690
Oh, that's so weird.

2999
03:19:44,890 --> 03:19:48,690
Okay, that's what I was thinking was happening before, but it wasn't.

3000
03:19:48,950 --> 03:19:49,730
Okay.

3001
03:19:52,730 --> 03:19:53,210
Okay!

3002
03:19:55,250 --> 03:19:55,730
Strange.

3003
03:19:58,510 --> 03:20:00,070
It's not quite intuitive.

3004
03:20:00,410 --> 03:20:01,670
Thank you for the help, Gars.

3005
03:20:08,420 --> 03:20:10,700
That's about all of the ones we can work with.

3006
03:20:10,920 --> 03:20:14,700
This game is so vastly different than what I imagined.

3007
03:20:15,380 --> 03:20:16,180
Ready to pull the switch?

3008
03:20:17,360 --> 03:20:17,920
You know me.

3009
03:20:18,220 --> 03:20:18,860
Always ready.

3010
03:20:29,260 --> 03:20:29,740
Whoa.

3011
03:20:29,960 --> 03:20:33,480
Alright, let's go check out what souvenirs he brought back from the moon.

3012
03:20:34,400 --> 03:20:35,200
Ladies first?

3013
03:20:35,880 --> 03:20:36,780
Not this time.

3014
03:20:38,320 --> 03:20:38,920
Where do I go?

3015
03:20:39,740 --> 03:20:40,140
Heal?

3016
03:20:45,380 --> 03:20:47,040
What did you think it was going to be like?

3017
03:20:47,680 --> 03:20:48,560
I had no idea.

3018
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:50,100
I didn't know anything about it.

3019
03:20:50,820 --> 03:20:51,280
Oh, hello?

3020
03:20:54,920 --> 03:20:55,540
Is it you?

3021
03:21:03,840 --> 03:21:06,220
This is the same setting as this real last accessible.

3022
03:21:06,240 --> 03:21:29,790
memory usually there's at least some change something isn't right these memories they feel more than having happened again they are exactly the same that's impossible the desire was transferred was it not it was if

3023
03:21:37,980 --> 03:21:42,940
this is indeed the same memory he'd be at the clip oh that's right my bed

3024
03:21:46,720 --> 03:21:47,160
Aww.

3025
03:21:55,820 --> 03:21:56,220
Johnny?

3026
03:21:57,080 --> 03:22:01,350
What a pleasant surprise.

3027
03:22:01,490 --> 03:22:03,130
We don't get many visitors around here.

3028
03:22:03,970 --> 03:22:04,650
Deja vu again.

3029
03:22:05,370 --> 03:22:07,290
My name is Dr. Eva Rosaline.

3030
03:22:07,470 --> 03:22:09,050
And this is...

3031
03:22:09,850 --> 03:22:10,290
What?

3032
03:22:10,670 --> 03:22:11,750
I'm not saying it twice.

3033
03:22:12,910 --> 03:22:13,950
Dr. Neil Watts.

3034
03:22:16,410 --> 03:22:19,250
Are you familiar with the Sigmund Agency of Life Generation?

3035
03:22:20,230 --> 03:22:21,470
Oh, are you two from the agency?

3036
03:22:23,870 --> 03:22:24,750
How convenient.

3037
03:22:24,870 --> 03:22:26,370
I've just been thinking of calling you.

3038
03:22:27,730 --> 03:22:28,870
Lily, get us some tea, please.

3039
03:22:35,220 --> 03:22:37,380
I'm reading the same conversation twice!

3040
03:22:38,820 --> 03:22:39,520
We don't...

3041
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:41,860
We usually only get VTubers out here.

3042
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:44,420
Freeze him, too.

3043
03:22:49,380 --> 03:22:49,840
Uh-oh.

3044
03:22:50,940 --> 03:22:51,500
Well...

3045
03:22:52,480 --> 03:22:53,300
Wait, here.

3046
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:55,520
I'll go send you a desire signal again.

3047
03:22:55,980 --> 03:22:57,140
See if there's any changes.

3048
03:23:02,020 --> 03:23:02,540
Uh...

3049
03:23:03,140 --> 03:23:05,060
It transferred successfully for sure.

3050
03:23:06,060 --> 03:23:06,700
Any changes?

3051
03:23:07,540 --> 03:23:08,480
Not even a hair.

3052
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:13,180
How could this be?

3053
03:23:13,280 --> 03:23:16,660
Even if his desire doesn't work alone, why is there no change at all?

3054
03:23:17,600 --> 03:23:17,960
Perhaps.

3055
03:23:18,500 --> 03:23:20,920
Perhaps it just needs some provoking to activate.

3056
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:24,340
From his early memories?

3057
03:23:25,480 --> 03:23:26,780
The earliest we can get to.

3058
03:23:28,340 --> 03:23:29,120
Let's go.

3059
03:23:35,890 --> 03:23:36,950
Kind of spooky.

3060
03:23:38,190 --> 03:23:49,030
It's like he doesn't want to if you can't force a what if he's too dumb to become an astronaut What if he just doesn't have the brain power

3061
03:23:57,150 --> 03:24:06,970
Just like me I wanted to be a nurse and then I took chemistry and I give up Johnny's desire to go to the moon might need some stimulation to be brought up, huh?

3062
03:24:08,510 --> 03:24:16,290
Well, then Moon moon moon Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon!

3063
03:24:16,990 --> 03:24:18,490
What the?

3064
03:24:18,930 --> 03:24:21,130
This wasn't what they said was playing.

3065
03:24:22,430 --> 03:24:22,790
Moon, Moon.

3066
03:24:23,070 --> 03:24:23,570
Oh well.

3067
03:24:24,990 --> 03:24:25,750
Do you mind River?

3068
03:24:26,990 --> 03:24:28,610
What if River goes to the moon instead?

3069
03:24:29,650 --> 03:24:30,690
No, I like this one.

3070
03:24:31,530 --> 03:24:32,810
Alright, let's go then!

3071
03:24:33,270 --> 03:24:37,090
Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon, Moon!

3072
03:24:37,250 --> 03:24:38,710
I'm shaking him by his shoulders.

3073
03:24:39,490 --> 03:24:39,490
Moon!

3074
03:24:39,970 --> 03:24:40,430
Moon!

3075
03:24:40,430 --> 03:24:40,850
Moon!

3076
03:24:41,570 --> 03:24:44,270
Hopefully that's enough for an ignition.

3077
03:24:46,330 --> 03:24:49,810
I went and saw the moon movie once and I became an astronaut.

3078
03:24:51,270 --> 03:24:51,270
Wait.

3079
03:24:51,770 --> 03:24:52,390
Where is Neil?

3080
03:24:54,950 --> 03:24:57,650
Moon, moon, moon, moon.

3081
03:24:58,270 --> 03:24:59,230
Part of me, you guys?

3082
03:24:59,350 --> 03:25:00,730
I'm not gonna be... I'm not gonna lie.

3083
03:25:02,650 --> 03:25:04,750
My voice has been really hurting.

3084
03:25:06,310 --> 03:25:07,390
Talking so much.

3085
03:25:07,830 --> 03:25:10,410
I wanted to complete this in one goal, but...

3086
03:25:11,250 --> 03:25:14,170
I'm feeling it might be better if I make this a two-parter.

3087
03:25:17,530 --> 03:25:18,550
Finish next week?

3088
03:25:19,090 --> 03:25:19,650
I think so.

3089
03:25:19,830 --> 03:25:20,990
If that's okay with you guys.

3090
03:25:27,130 --> 03:25:29,990
I don't know why my throat is hurting so much today.

3091
03:25:30,410 --> 03:25:31,190
I think I've just been...

3092
03:25:31,190 --> 03:25:33,530
I've had to do a lot of recording and stuff lately.

3093
03:25:35,630 --> 03:25:36,030
So...

3094
03:25:42,510 --> 03:25:45,010
I haven't had so much time to actually rest my voice.

3095
03:25:45,370 --> 03:25:46,890
Even on the days that I'm not streaming.

3096
03:25:47,870 --> 03:26:21,150
what we'll do is then we will uh we will then save it for next week if that's all ready with you guys so it's kind of ending on a bit of a cliffhanger so i'm really excited to pick it back up so thank you guys meet and greets singing and recording yeah it's been kind of a lot i think maybe after the weekend the u.s idol festival i you know i was singing so much and uh I had to also sing my entire set because,

3097
03:26:21,250 --> 03:26:33,170
you know, just, I always, I, you know, I don't know if other people will do this, but I usually get asked that just in case, like, the internet doesn't work, that I have a backup recording that they can play.

3098
03:26:34,790 --> 03:26:35,990
Luckily, the internet was okay.

3099
03:26:36,410 --> 03:26:38,910
But so then I'm always having to do my set twice.

3100
03:26:41,030 --> 03:26:42,250
So, yeah, yeah.

3101
03:26:44,790 --> 03:26:46,970
But, yeah, we'll end it here then.

3102
03:26:47,870 --> 03:27:14,330

Dorko, thank you so much for the being.

3105
03:27:22,850 --> 03:27:25,230
Please rest your voice and feel better looking outside the moon, sure.

3106
03:27:25,430 --> 03:27:25,890
The moon?

3107
03:27:27,630 --> 03:27:30,970
The moon sure is beautiful tonight, isn't it?

3108
03:27:32,030 --> 03:27:32,430
I bet.

3109
03:27:32,790 --> 03:27:33,570
I bet it is.

3110
03:27:37,210 --> 03:27:38,770
Happy Yoshi Day, Vito.

3111
03:27:38,930 --> 03:27:39,910
I'm so glad you're my Yoshi.

3112
03:27:40,090 --> 03:27:41,330
Next scene, thank you.

Thank you, thank you.

3114
03:27:42,790 --> 03:27:44,030
Happy Yoshi Day.

Thank you.

3116
03:27:45,270 --> 03:27:47,850
I hope you guys all had a good day with your Yoshi.

3117
03:27:51,390 --> 03:27:51,750
She's...

3118
03:27:51,750 --> 03:27:53,910
And a horror game that detects the mic.

3119
03:27:54,050 --> 03:27:54,790
Oh my gosh, right?

3120
03:27:55,330 --> 03:27:57,350
So that I purposefully can't speak.

3121
03:27:58,610 --> 03:27:58,970
Take care, Minto.

3122
03:27:59,190 --> 03:27:59,650
Happy OCD.

3123
03:27:59,850 --> 03:28:00,590
Happy OCD.

3124
03:28:01,170 --> 03:28:01,890
Thank you so much.

3125
03:28:02,090 --> 03:28:03,350
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3126
03:28:04,110 --> 03:28:05,710
Thank you so much for the super chats.

3127
03:28:05,870 --> 03:28:06,350
Thank you, guys.

3128
03:28:06,370 --> 03:28:07,230
I really, really appreciate it.

3129
03:28:07,250 --> 03:28:08,670
And all the gift and memberships and everything.

3130
03:28:09,290 --> 03:28:09,890
Thank you, thank you.

3131
03:28:10,610 --> 03:28:13,090
So I will see you when I see you next.

3132
03:28:14,110 --> 03:28:15,510
And next time I see you...

3133
03:28:15,510 --> 03:28:16,190
Well, no, sorry.

3134
03:28:17,870 --> 03:28:18,630
Next week!

3135
03:28:19,410 --> 03:28:19,870
I think...

3136
03:28:20,510 --> 03:28:23,090
Well, hold on, sorry, I'm checking the calendar.

3137
03:28:23,830 --> 03:28:25,470
Next week, I'm only streaming Monday.

3138
03:28:27,010 --> 03:28:28,530
So we'll finish this game on Monday.

3139
03:28:30,890 --> 03:28:31,630
Sound good?

3140
03:28:34,910 --> 03:28:35,430
Otsumito!

3141
03:28:35,890 --> 03:28:36,310
Otsumito!

3142
03:28:36,670 --> 03:28:37,090
Otsumito!

3143
03:28:38,010 --> 03:28:39,010
Thank you, everybody!

3144
03:28:39,130 --> 03:28:40,410
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

3145
03:28:40,410 --> 03:28:41,390
It's a-o!

3146
03:28:43,030 --> 03:28:43,870
Bye-bye!

3147
03:28:44,090 --> 03:28:44,470
Bye-bye!

3148
03:28:45,130 --> 03:28:45,910
Bye-bye!

3149
03:28:49,270 --> 03:28:51,130
I really appreciate you guys so much.

3150
03:28:51,430 --> 03:28:51,750
Thank you!

3151
03:28:51,870 --> 03:28:52,370
Bye-bye!
