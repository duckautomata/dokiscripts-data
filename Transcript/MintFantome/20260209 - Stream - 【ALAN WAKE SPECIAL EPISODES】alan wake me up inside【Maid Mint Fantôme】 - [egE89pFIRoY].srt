00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,460

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960

Welcome in, welcome in, welcome, welcome, welcome!

4
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,300
Hello!

5
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,580
How's it going?

6
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:41,200
Right before this, I was, I was, I was going through my
closets in the maid cafe.

7
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Going through my stuff.

8
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm getting ready for packing for my move.

9
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,660
So I'm like,

10
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,040
Darth Binky.

11
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,840
Darth Binky.

12
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,920
Hi, Mito.

13
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,680
Hello!

14
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,840
We eating good today.

15
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,500
Are we?

16
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,560
We got Alan Wake going on.

17
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,620
We're with this guy one more time before we go into Alan
Wake 2, maybe.

18
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,080
The move is happening.

19
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,800
Well, it's fine.

20
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,920
It's actually kind of fun because I'm like a, you know, I'm
a bit of a collector.

21
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:37,380
And so I'm like going through some things and I'll find
something and be like, Yeah, this was a cool thing that I

22
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,740
got.

23
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
That just got shoved into my closet.

24
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,540
So that's fun.

25
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,720
It's always fun.

26
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,320
But everything is dusty and hopefully I don't sneeze.

27
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,540
Reintroducing yourself to your treasures.

28
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,160
Yes.

29
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,060
Baby Cori, thank you so much for the fun.

30
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,260
Get the thank you.

31
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,860
But I'm also having to do the dreaded task of like...

32
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:11,440
you know, when you like something, but you're like, I must,
I must really love this thing to take it with me, you know,

33
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,280
where you're like, I like this thing, I don't want to part
with it, but at the same time, yeah, Marie Kondo is judging

34
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,700
me.

35
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,460
Keep or donate.

36
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,920
That is, that is the sad truth.

37
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,540
But I have, one thing, a lot of stuff that I've been
donating is Sanrio things.

38
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,980
of like cinnamarol stuff.

39
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,040
Crayon name.

40
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,220
Thank you so much for the fun.

41
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,220
Thank you.

42
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:39,980
Thank you.

43
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,560
Thank you.

44
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:50,220
And luckily, I don't feel so bad donating that because I'm
like, I know that cinnamarol and Sanrio and stuff like that

45
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,320
is pretty popular.

46
00:07:52,940 --> 00:08:00,680
So I feel that like someone's gonna go to the thrift store
and be like, what is this treasure trove?

47
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,620
It's my birthday today and we don't stream is the perfect
and...

48
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,000
Bionic Ebo!

49
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,270
Happy birthday!

50
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,670
Happy birthday!

51
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,150
Happy, happy birthday!

52
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,730
Thank you so much for the Hakka Supa!

53
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,390
No!

54
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,350
You guys make me feel so bad when you send Hakka Supas on
your birthday!

55
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,650
You should be getting yourself something so nice!

56
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,670
You should be getting yourself something so nice!

57
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,730
I will accept cinnamural donations.

58
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,110
Yeah.

59
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,830
Somewhere in the virtual world, the thrift store is
overflowing with Sanrio merchandise.

60
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,010
So, yeah.

61
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,370
I hope that they go to a good home.

62
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,910
Look, I'm keeping the ones that are like my favorite, super
ultra favorite things.

63
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,710
And then everything else, I'm like, okay, I can part with
you.

64
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:16,790
uh uh uh i'm hesitant of it but i am i am doing it don't let
iron mouse know where you donate to i think probably she has

66
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:47,390
things I've been looking into moving services and all of the
fun things, all the fancy things I must look into.

67
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:54,250
So, yeah, busy, busy, but I can't wait.

68
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,330
Remember all those Metal Gear acrylic standees I got?

69
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,870
All those teeny tiny ones of every single character.

70
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,330
I can't wait to take all of them apart.

71
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,390
I can't wait.

72
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,350
I just put them all together.

73
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,830
I can't wait to take them apart.

74
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,190
Hello, Minto, and I booze like you.

75
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,390
Excited for a chill?

76
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,150
Question mark?

77
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,390
Should be chill, right?

78
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,610
It's a day stream with Minto after doing some home
maintenance.

79
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,070
Drained my water heater for the first time and learned some
more new things about taking care of a home.

80
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,830
Look at you!

81
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,510
Como!

82
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,650
Oh my gosh, you're like doing it.

83
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,870
You're doing the thing.

84
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,010
You're doing the thing that everybody hates to do.

85
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,330
Look at you, go!

86
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,530
Good job.

87
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,370
Every single character, meanwhile, is 99 figures of Ocelot.

88
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,690
Nagi-san, happy birthday!

89
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,950
I'm not doing anything.

90
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:58,530
You know what?

91
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,030
That's a good thing to do.

92
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,890
That's a good thing to do, too.

93
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,030
It's just take it easy and not do anything, you know?

94
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,350
Yes, yes.

95
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:07,730
Responsibilities.

96
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,990
Don't think about responsibilities today.

97
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,770
Think about only your birthday!

98
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,850
Am I moving to a new time zone?

99
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,770
Hmm, yes.

100
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,810
But I still plan on streaming my normal times.

101
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,510
I think probably times like these this time might be a
little more difficult to do for me.

102
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,390
Like, you know, right now it's 4 p.m.

103
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,570
EST for me.

104
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,250
But we will cross that road when we come to it.

105
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,270
I will figure out.

106
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,870
No, no, no rip EU.

107
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,490
No rip EU.

108
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,970
It might just end up being a little bit different.

109
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,590
But it's my first, like, big, big move.

110
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:03,350
You know, I died and I was in one maid cafe, and then I
haunted another maid cafe, and now I'm gonna go hunt a far

111
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,250
away cafe.

112
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,150
So, So, are you going to move in with us?

113
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,890
Is that an invitation or?

114
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,730
I leave for the Appalachian...

115
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,690
The Appalachian Trail on Wednesday.

116
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,290
The whole thing is about 2,200 miles.

117
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,970
And I want to hike it all.

118
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,310
Seeing my Oshi go to the ends of the earth just to give us
another smile is so inspired.

119
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,670
You were so inspired.

120
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,010
You decided to hike thousands of miles.

121
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,430
Good luck, Phoenix.

122
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:45,410
moving is such a nightmare for me i moved over a year and a
half ago and still unpacking stuff really i don't i don't

123
00:12:45,410 --> 00:13:00,810
it's 5 a.m for chinese fan i'm sorry thank you for waking up
i'm sorry um i uh what was i saying um oh i don't have so

124
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:11,170
it's funny like i have a ton of stuff but it's all right so
I don't think as long as I have like a display cabinet I

125
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:22,150
can't imagine it would take me so long to unpack stuff you
know that's the hope at least give getting my figures out

126
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:29,110
getting my display stuff out thank you for la-la

127
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,870
just don't overwork yourself too much Yeah, no worries.

128
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,870
I think it will still be not so difficult for me.

129
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,710
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

130
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,990
Yes, yes, yes.

131
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,130
But we're back with Alan Wake.

132
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,870
We beat the game, actually.

133
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,870
But today we are doing...

134
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,570
Extras.

135
00:13:59,470 --> 00:13:59,750
Wait.

136
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,710
Wait, where are...

Special one and special two.

139
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,680
I was like, um.

140
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,720
Hi, Mint.

141
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,640
I've been watching videos and came to your stream to write
an injustice.

142
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,540
An injustice.

143
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,220
Can I have this adorable ghost's hand in marriage?

144
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,760
Is there another ghost haunting you?

145
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,540
Or?

146
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,670
Oh, spirits.

147
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,810
That's not me.

148
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,730
Oh, spirit.

149
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,490

Can I get a happy birthday?

177
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,830
Fox Eye!

178
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,970
Happy birthday!

179
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,530
Happy, happy birthday!

180
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,230
Phil, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

181
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,750
Brandon, hello!

182
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,070
I'm doing great.

183
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,150
I hope you are too.

184
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,410
Shall we get into it then?

185
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,030
Shall we get into...

186
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,370
Oh wait.

187
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,950
Kanye irresponsible spending yeast.

188
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,550
What happened to...

189
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,270
Don't spend it irresponsibly, everybody.

190
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,680
Alan, start!

191
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,500
I like how Alan has become our little Pokemon.

192
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,120
We command him.

193
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,400
We're like, Alan jump.

194
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,600
Alan run.

195
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,480
Alan dodge.

196
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,320
Alan start.

197
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,360
He's doing everything but Alan waking.

198
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Alan spend.

199
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,040
No, no, no.

200
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,320
This isn't much.

201
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,660
Oh my gosh, please don't say that.

202
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,360
No, it's more than enough.

203
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,440
Thank you, Henry.

204
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,740
Thank you for streaming.

205
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,400
It's an awesome post of B-Day present.

206
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,060
Happy birthday, Henry.

207
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,960
Happy birthday.

208
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,420
Yes.

209
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,620
I choose Alan.

210
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,340
Alan, I choose you.

211
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,380
Do we though?

212
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,600
Do we choose Alan?

213
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,840
We're still working on Alan climb.

214
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Yeah.

215
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,560
Oh my gosh, Darko!

216
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,860
I saw, I saw, I haven't gotten it yet, but I saw what you
sent to the PO box.

217
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,840
Thank you.

218
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,160
Thank you.

219
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,920
Thank you.

220
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
I got sent pictures.

221
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,680
People are sending things to PO box.

222
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,940
Thank you very much.

223
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,940
Was it a labubu?

224
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,100
No, Ho Ho sent a mint labubu.

225
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,560
Yeah, Ho Ho sent one.

226
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,880
Sure thing.

227
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,140
Thank you!

228
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,300
A mint bubu.

229
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,520
Labenki?

230
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,860
Labenki.

231
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,240
I didn't, it wasn't, it's not an actual Laboobu, but it's
like, I think it's a Laboobu skin, and then the face is me.

232
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,060
Like, like it, maybe, I don't know.

233
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,700
I don't know how she did it.

234
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,840
Sasuka's strongest eyeball.

235
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,900
I love her.

236
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,800
I love her.

237
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,800
I don't think they have skins.

238
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,820
I don't know if it was skinned or not.

239
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,400
Hmm.

240
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,600
I'll have to see once I get it.

241
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,340
I received photos of things from the PO box from Manesan
this morning.

242
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,160
But yeah.

243
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,280
Special one is the signal and special two is the rider.

244
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
That's Alan Wake.

245
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,920
He's the rider.

246
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,380
I am so curious.

247
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,940
Existing checkpoint will be overwritten.

248
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,740
Yeah, that's fine.

249
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,620
Right?

250
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:18,140
I'm so curious though what these special episodes are going
to be about because I'm like...

251
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,940
Previously on Alan Wake.

252
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh, I guess we'll...

253
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,540
I only know is the dark presence, held my wife captive, and
used her to make me write a horror story that came true.

254
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,040
I guess this is a good summary, right?

255
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,860
I believe me had been aware enough to write my escape into
the story.

256
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,040
And then he hugged her.

257
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,080
And she cringed to death.

258
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,320
Helen?

259
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,680
I saved Alice.

260
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,720
Then wrote a better ending for the story.

261
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,940
But not without a price.

262
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,480
I was trapped somewhere in the dark place.

263
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,960
A strange zone somewhere beyond our world.

264
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,920
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,260
It's an ocean.

266
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,020
It's an ocean.

267
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,660
It's an ocean.

268
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,080
Special feature one.

269
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,980
Oh, thank you!

270
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,740
After the completion of any difficult undertaking, there are
mixed emotions.

271
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,760
Accomplishment and relief.

272
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,680
Sadness, depression.

273
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,580
For a while, everything is about to work.

274
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,360
Like an illness, it consumed you.

275
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,500
Changed you.

276
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,280
You locked yourself away from the world to do it, and now
you need to recover.

277
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,320
Learn to live without it.

278
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,000
Find a way to crack open the door and let the light back in.

279
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,600
She's just going around town.

280
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:30,380
I knew this place It was familiar But wrong somehow How is
it wrong?

281
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,380

282

All right.

304
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,980
I thought he was wearing a t-shirt, like a...

305
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,520
T-shirt.

306
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,080
Alright.

307
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,940
We're walking to the restroom.

308
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,260
We've done all of this before.

309
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,280
I've played this game before!

310
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,780
Don't go in there, young man.

311
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,900
You can hurt yourself in the dark.

312
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,360
I don't like the clock tick.

313
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,140
Do you guys hear that?

314
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,340
Here's the bathroom.

315
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,640
Oh.

316
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,660
Push.

317
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,880
Whoa!

318
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,520
Wait!

319
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
We're actually able to go in!

320
00:23:48,460 --> 00:24:05,680

listen no deeper what focus you're losing yourself I will

321
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:15,040

point of contact what do you mean I cannot hear you please

322
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,120
you're the one making all this happen concentrate This is
what's happening.

323
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,540
Oh.

324
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,100
Too deep.

325
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,780
Can't take the pressure.

326
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,040
It's too much.

327
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,480
Oh my god, Alan, you need to wake.

328
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,920
Wake found himself face to face with himself.

329
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,680
At the sight of myself, the dream suddenly became lucid.

330
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,680
The dark place.

331
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,100
The dark place.

332
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,360
Remember who you...

333
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,380
Oh, yes I do.

334
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,220
Oh, oh.

335
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,560
It's not the light itself.

336
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,000
But what it represents.

337
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,820
Oh,

338
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,900
and a gun, you'll need a gun.

339
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,020
This is not a gun.

340
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,480
Oh, it's not a gun.

341
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,720
Just kidding.

342
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,480
Be careful.

343
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,200
I will try to find a better point of contact.

344
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,000
I didn't understand Zane's message.

345
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,520
And knowing where I was didn't fix anything.

346
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,360
Something had gone wrong after I had finished departure.

347
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,960
Miro was here.

348
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,760
Who the heck is...

349
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Oh, is that one of the brothers?

350
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,680
Miro is not here.

351
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,060
Oh, are they all going to be wanting to attack me once
I'm...

352
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,760
Oh, once I leave.

353
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,080
I'm scared.

354
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,040
Ehhhh!

355
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,700
What the hell was that?

356
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,620
Oh, it's a rambly.

357
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,980
Oh, gosh.

358
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh!

359
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,280
Oh!

360
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,480
Oh!

361
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,180
Oh!

362
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,520
The diner could become deserted.

363
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,940
Then the door was smashed.

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,640

Oh my god!

369
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,920
Oh my god, there's so many guys here.

370
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,540
Oh my god, there's so many guys here.

371
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,040
Oh shoot, how do I dodge again?

372
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,500
Oh shoot!

373
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,020
Ouch!

374
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,840
Can I leave?

375
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,180
Kick!

376
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,310
Okay.

377
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,530
Oh, wait.

378
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,790
The world has become twisted.

379
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,250
Whoa.

380
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,030
These trees didn't belong here.

381
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,750
These trees didn't belong here.

382
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,570
Where do they belong?

383
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,590
Okay.

384
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:57,830
Whoa!

385
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,730
Is there something over here?

386
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,730
I'm just checking.

387
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,450
Oh, it's like a phone.

388
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,650
Oh, no trees!

389
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,930
Alan had to fight for his life.

390
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,090
Alan made it.

391
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,630
Wait, um, hold on.

392
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,610
I remember remembering how to...

393
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:22,910
Shoot.

394
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:23,930
No.

395
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,670
Remembering how to play this game?

396
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,330
Ah!

397
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:28,790
Ouch!

398
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,910
Oh my god.

399
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,740
Helen ambush!

400
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,760
Alan run!

401
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,780
Alan reload.

402
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,560
Look, doesn't it look bright enough here that the darkness
wouldn't attack me here?

403
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:00,840
Oh my god!

404
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,760
Sorry!

405
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,900
Oh my god, they scare me so bad!

406
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,080
They scare me so bad, you guys!

407
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,400
Run, Alan run!

408
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,220
Oh, am I not safe in here?

409
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,540
Oh, shoot.

410
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,440
I don't think I am.

411
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,060
Wait, why is it so bright then?

412
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,520
Sorry, guys.

413
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,420
Merely the concept of light.

414
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,660
Must be.

415
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,240
Oh, the door shut.

416
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:35,840
That's nice.

417
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,800
Oh, I can't go upstairs.

418
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Okay.

419
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,780
Alan's scared.

420
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,220
Alan spooked.

421
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,280
Oh, look.

422
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,400
We're like going through everything at the moment.

423
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,700
Oh no, that's not a manuscript page, is it?

424
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,660
Why is the...

425
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,700
Why is it blue?

426
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,540
Da-ba-di, da-ba-di.

427
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,650
I knew it was my writing, but the words were jumbled,
dream-like fragments.

428
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,750
Oh, so you're writing.

429
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,670
The rounds of slippery stones throw away from the tent.

430
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,270
Me no breathe!

431
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,270
She was startled by the fog.

432
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,910
I was startled by the phone.

433
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,590
Who was phone?

434
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:23,550
What?

435
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,890
Oh my god, it's phone.

436
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,230
The GPS system was working.

437
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,870
I hadn't expected that.

438
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,430
Don't breathe.

439
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,970
I'm breathing!

440
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,750
Hello?

441
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,390
Hello?

442
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,850
I'm trying to reach you.

443
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,110
Can you hear me?

444
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,770
Can you hear me now?

445
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,330
Yeah?

446
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,450
Yes.

447
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,370
Listen, I can help you.

448
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,130
but you're drifting deeper.

449
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,670
I can't reach you.

450
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,810
You must come to me.

451
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,110
Okay.

452
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,150
I can't make

453
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:57,840
you...

454
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,020
Follow the signal.

455
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,620
It made no sense for the GPS system to work.

456
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,400
I doubted any satellite was in range here.

457
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,480
These were alien skies, but it was God-like towards
something.

458
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,180
Towards Zane?

459
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,600
My flashlight wasn't working.

460
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,620
I don't know why.

461
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,200
Ouch, ouch.

462
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,060
We got a new flashlight.

463
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,440
Heavy duty?

464
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,680
Follow the words.

465
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,020
Oh, flare gun?

466
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,120
I'll take that, yeah.

467
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,790
What if there's one that says, like, evil guy?

468
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,360
Recharge.

469
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,960
Don't get too close.

470
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,190
Ooh.

471
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,210
Nice.

472
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,810
Okay.

473
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,170
Okay.

474
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,240
Is this door open now?

475
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,560
Do I go...

476
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I guess I go back outside the way I can.

477
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,820
Oh, wait.

478
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,640
Is this a door?

479
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,440
Whoa!

480
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,400
The dark place was playing tricks on me.

481
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,840
It wouldn't stay still.

482
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,300
Oh, fun.

483
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,460
We're like going through everywhere that we've been.

484
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,140
Oh.

485
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,400
The town itself turned against Wake.

486
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:30,880
Oh, no.

487
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,380
No.

488
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,380
Crack bone!

489
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,760
What the hell was that?

490
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,220
Bringing a new meaning to words have power.

491
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,960
This is literally Alan Wake.

492
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,560
It was exactly that.

493
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,060
It was exactly the emojis you guys are using.

494
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh, man.

495
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,740
Maybe I should use my flare gun on the big...

496
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,340
What's it called?

497
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,780
Whatever's going to be the cars.

498
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,940
What is it going to attack me?

499
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,060
Follow the GPS signal.

500
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,060
Oh, I guess I go towards the yellow.

501
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:10,720
Okay.

502
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,900
As usual.

503
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,660
As you did in the regular game too.

504
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,780
Oh, that's a lot though.

505
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,720
That's a lot.

506
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,280
Oh my god.

507
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,040
Ouch!

508
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,740
Ouch, oh, oh, oh!

509
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,780
Oh, shoot.

510
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,800
I do think I need to run.

511
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,480
Oh my gosh.

512
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,620
I'm going to go back to my regular.

513
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:50,040
do i go in here okay stop running in slow motion please i
know this is a dream but like out the door hurts everything

514
00:32:50,040 --> 00:33:05,500
hurt out the door hurts tools out the tool i died sticks and
stones may break my bones but tools i thought the world

515
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,100
Words were not supposed to hurt me!

516
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,860
No way.

517
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:26,640
It oozed hate.

518
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,640
Run, run, run!

519
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,560
Dodge, dodge, dodge!

520
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,780
Okay, what if I, like, get it from here?

521
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,120
I think I'm pretty protected over here.

522
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,240
Oh my god, don't get hit by the tools.

523
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,760
Come on now.

524
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,780
Be careful.

525
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,460
I picked up a flare.

526
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,140
And some stuff.

527
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,320
And some stuff.

528
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,200
And some stuff.

529
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,300
And a shotgun.

530
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,600
And...

531
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,260
I'm guessing I have...

532
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,080
Oh, I just keep following the signal light.

533
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,040
Wait, what else is in here?

534
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,580
I think they're not doing so hot out there.

535
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,500
I think they're pretty angry at me even.

536
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,760
I wonder if I can get it from the door.

537
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,850
Anything in

538
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,130
here.

539
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,590
Wait, how do I use my flare?

540
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,110
There we go.

541
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,710
I'm guessing this door doesn't work.

542
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,230
So I do have to...

543
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,830
Oh my god!

544
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,630
Oh my god.

545
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,030
Oh my god.

546
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,200
Oh my god.

547
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,420
Dodge, dodge, please!

548
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,440
This is a tough area to be locked in, too.

549
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,400
Oh my god.

550
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,100
I'm stuck.

551
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,700
I'm stuck.

552
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,300
Good.

553
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
Oh, jeez!

554
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,720
I didn't know the DLC was going to be like extra nightmare
mode.

555
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,540
What the hell?

556
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,480
Where's that kill?

557
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,740
Would you speak up to me?

558
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,620
They're like, you better get good at the game.

559
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:37,700
Stupid.

560
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,020
Is there anything else in here that I can pick up?

561
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,300
Or do I have to spawn in everything?

562
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,080
Did you pick hard difficulty?

563
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:48,500
No!

564
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,460
I picked... Maybe I should have picked easy!

565
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,860
Everything I saw was familiar and yet it wasn't.

566
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,420
Wow.

567
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,060
Hello?

568
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,340
I cannot keep up.

569
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,840
You're going too deep.

570
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,360
I will try to guide you.

571
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,640
Follow the signal.

572
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,220
I'm trying!

573
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,040
You must face yourself.

574
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,200
Follow me?

575
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,520
I'm facing myself?

576
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Oh.

577
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,420

Jump.

583
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:56,700
Whoa.

584
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,920
DLC is only for true wakeheads.

585
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,220
I'll do my best.

586
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,020
Flash!

587
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:07,660
Flare!

588
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,940
Flare!

589
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,140
Flare!

590
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,200
Flare!

591
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Tools!

592
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,400
I have to use words to give supplies!

593
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,820
Aw, man.

594
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,820
Give me tools!

595
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,710
Okay, don't drop please.

596
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,850
Oh my gosh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

597
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,550
You guys saw that the ammo fell!

598
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,260
The ammo fell!

599
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,540
Flash!

600
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,460
No, no, no, no.

601
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

602
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,340
Washbang.

603
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,780
Don't get too close.

604
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:01,980
It bites.

605
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,840
That's me.

606
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,220
Oh.

607
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,240
Oh, that's...

608
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,660
Sarah Breaker.

609
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,500
Sarah Breaker, Bright Falls Finest.

610
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,400
The red hot cop chick with the lightning fast broomstick.

611
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,900
I don't remember this episode of...

612
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,040
of Sesame Street.

613
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,100
Why is this, oh, because of the words.

614
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,160
Her debut book, the only girl in the book house delves deep
into the double life of having a successful law enforcement

615
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,200
career while being involved in a secret society.

616
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,240
How does daddy's little trooper fit into an old fashioned
fraternity?

617
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,400
What?

618
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,210
What does that mean?

619
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,730
Let's get my flares out.

620
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,650
Um...

621
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,450
Reload...

622
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:07,890
Okay.

623
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,850
Follow the signal.

624
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Oh, geez.

625
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,220
Oh, geez.

626
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,560
Use your arms, Alan.

627
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,260
I remember this park.

628
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,120
I used to have a statue there.

629
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,760
Oh, I think there's a guy there?

630
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,280
Oh, I think there's many guys here.

631
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,040
Okay.

632
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,340
Oh, geez.

633
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,020
Oh, shoot.

634
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,680
Okay.

635
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,400
Alright.

636
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,460
Oh, my God.

637
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,040
And birds!

638
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,740
Oh my god.

639
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,440
Oh shoot!

640
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:53,980
Oh shoot!

641
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:54,700
Oh shoot!

642
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,360
Oh my god, I'm trying to shoot!

643
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,800
Guys, this is hard.

644
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,900
What the hell?

645
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,420
This is so hard!

646
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,960
Oh my god!

647
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:08,980
Please!

648
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,720
Give me a second!

649
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,220
Ah!

650
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,660
Okay.

651
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,600
You.

652
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,340
Are there still birds?

653
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,420
Oh, my God.

654
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm getting...

655
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,040
I'm getting...

656
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,980
Oh, my God.

657
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,540
I'm getting my booty beat here.

658
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,300
This is crazy.

659
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,780
Nice recovery.

660
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,540
I was trying to, like, see if I could gather them all into
the same place to use the flare gun.

661
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,660
Maybe I should have a flash.

662
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,360
bang for next time, maybe.

663
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,440
Golly.

664
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,860
More tools, please!

665
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,380
Oh.

666
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,040
Is this American nightmare?

667
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,320
No, this is my nightmare.

668
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,840
Okay, well, I guess we don't have to go searching for stuff.

669
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,940
Like, if there is...

670
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,300
If there's tools, or if there's ammo or something, we know
where to get it.

671
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,860
Kind of situation.

672
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,560
because we'll see tools.

673
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,180
Oh, is this not a checkpoint?

674
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,640
What was that?

675
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,460
Oh, all the lights are turning on.

676
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,540
Oh, oh, nice.

677
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,080
Yeah?

678
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,880
Where are you?

679
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,200
Look, I'm trying to follow your goddamn signal.

680
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,120
The dark place is playing tricks on you.

681
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,850
What is this?

682
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,570
I can help you if you just stop sinking.

683
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,990
I'm not trying.

684
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,230
This is bullshit.

685
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,450
It's happening again.

686
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,290
Brace yourself.

687
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:18,770
Oh, no.

688
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,730
What do you mean, brace myself?

689
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,210
Oh, good.

690
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,550
Oh, wait, I think this is a visual glitch.

691
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,750
You're in their territory now, Minto.

692
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,630
And he was telling me I was going too deep.

693
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,070
It was ridiculous.

694
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,230
But I was more scared than amused.

695
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,770
I felt like I was being hindered by an unseen force in ways
I couldn't fight.

696
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,030
All I could do was keep going.

697
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,730
But I'm going in deeper.

698
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,370
Good.

699
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,840
this way this way

700
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:27,020
oh shoot out out out out out oh my god please please please

701
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,480

702
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,540
Oh my gosh!

703
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,590
I was trying to use my...

704
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,030
Okay.

705
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,790
Oh!

706
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,390
Yeah.

707
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,790
Try and get me.

708
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,570
Asshole.

709
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,240
Yeah.

710
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,370
Oucha!

711
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,150
Stop it!

712
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,050
Stop it!

713
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,010
Oh my god.

714
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,890
There's too many of these guys.

715
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:04,670
Oh my god!

716
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,070
They are just keep throwing shit at me!

717
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,550
Oh my god, I'm so dead.

718
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,270
I'm so dead.

719
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,470
Wait, my flash...

720
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,050
It's time.

721
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,050
I don't care.

722
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,790
Oh my god, he's not even dead.

723
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,980
I am getting bullied!

724
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,920
Oh my god!

725
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,300
Gosh!

726
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,580
Um, signal goes this way.

chopper the chopper this happened before we found barry

729
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,360
they're gone investigate the flare boy i see more things.

730
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,720
Oh, recharge.

731
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,740
Get to the chopper!

732
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,520
Anything else?

733
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,320
It's so dark, I can't see anything.

734
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:38,980
Classic Alan Wake.

735
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,160
Okay.

736
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,320
I'll have my flare gun ready.

737
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,460
For now.

738
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,340
Oh.

739
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,040
I am...

740
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,280
Oh.

741
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,580
This is high-key stressing me out.

742
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,740
Oh,

743
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:10,640
okay.

744
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,240
It does look stressful.

745
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,220
Luckily, it's like...

746
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,440
You know what?

747
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,060
Screw it.

748
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:22,800
Oh.

749
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:23,920
Screw it.

750
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,400
Screw it.

751
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,960
I can't see anything.

752
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,200
I'm lost.

753
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:35,830
Just run.

754
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,470
Run to where?

755
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:38,770
I don't know.

756
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,950
Oh my gosh.

757
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:41,770
Hide behind the tree.

758
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:42,810
Alan hide.

759
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,910
Alan dodge.

760
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:45,990
Alan.

761
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:46,810
Oh, it's here.

762
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,010
Oh, shoot.

763
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,850
We have nowhere to hide for right here.

764
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:55,530
Alan go.

765
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,330
And defense.

766
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,250
I guess we go back through the church.

767
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,590
They're being...

768
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,470
They're being obnoxious and they're in there over there.

769
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,330
They're being They're doing their own thing in there

770
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:30,530
Oh, of course I do Alan, it's your memory just conjured you
said it was a lucid Oh, no, the deer

771
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:44,910
This is not gonna be good Okay Oh my god!

772
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:46,730
Where's the key?

773
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,910
Maybe if I'm like here, I can just like kind of...

774
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,530
It can't get me in here.

775
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,670
It can't get me behind here, right?

776
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,370
There's no way.

777
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,150
We might be able to juke this.

778
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,890
We might be able to juke this a little bit.

779
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,610
Oh, the key!

780
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,490
I see it!

781
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,470
Oh yeah.

782
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,860
Yeah, stupid!

783
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,100
Yeah, stupid!

784
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,080
I'm chilling!

785
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,460
I'm chilling!

786
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,100
Where is it?

787
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,060
It's like...

788
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,220
Sometimes I feel it, because, like, my controller will
rumble.

789
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,260
Oh, there it is.

790
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,160
I can get it.

791
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:48,680
I can get it.

792
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,400
Come on!

793
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:49,920
Oh!

794
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,180
Oh, holy cow!

795
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,540
That was so close!

796
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,760
Okay, there's just one more.

797
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,180
Just the deer's bottom half.

798
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,470
We can get it!

799
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,920
Nice camping zone.

800
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,340
Nice.

801
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,120
Key.

802
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,020
Now you're thinking with the world...

803
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,960
Oh, that's...

804
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,140
Oh!

805
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,160
I got the door open.

806
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,460
Run for it.

807
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,980
I'm running for it.

808
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,170
Four tools, please.

809
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:54,860
Okay.

810
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:55,780
Oh, flare?

811
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,360
Oh, more ammo?

812
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,740
Oh, I'm... Oh, okay.

813
00:49:59,320 --> 00:49:59,920
Wow, amazing.

814
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:01,520
Okay.

815
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,440
Alright!

816
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,740
Holy cow!

817
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,860
Oh!

818
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,100
Okay.

819
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,260
14 months, thank you!

820
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,400
I wish Alan would just listen to Zane.

821
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,060
Twisting.

822
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,720
Twisting.

823
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
It was too big on the inside.

824
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,720
He couldn't see the ceiling.

825
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,400
Something was moving in there.

826
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,740
He was lost.

827
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,700
He couldn't find the exit.

828
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,020
Asshole!

829
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:42,890
Kick.

830
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,030
Alan, kick!

831
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:45,910
Oh.

832
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:46,770
Good.

833
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:47,890
Uh-oh.

834
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:49,290
Are they behind me?

835
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,390
Are they down here?

836
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,050
Oh, geez.

837
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:55,370
Okay, checkpoint.

838
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:56,990
Okay, I have my flares.

839
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,270
I'm like, okay, I only have flares.

840
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:03,070
Gah.

841
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,140
The shifts were getting more severe.

842
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,840
I wasn't sure if the place got bigger or I got smaller.

843
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,600
The signal was going haywire.

844
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,140
Blast.

845
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,860
I would have to find my way out of here on my own.

846
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,660
I think that's it.

847
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,680
I think I wasted it.

848
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,090
Oh,

849
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,350
there's so many of them.

850
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:36,690
What the heck?

851
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,370
I have to like be careful.

852
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:41,970
Alan regret.

853
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,590
Just a little bit.

854
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,680
What's that sound?

855
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,090
What's that sound?

856
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,890
I have to be careful not to use it.

857
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,190
Like I have to accidentally shine my flashlight on it.

858
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:07,490
Oh,

859
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,620
I think it's the sound of the furnace.

860
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,740
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

861
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,620
Of course it is.

862
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,820
Oh, nice.

863
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,320
Okay, okay.

864
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,380
Oh, there is no signal down here.

865
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,120
I just realized.

866
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,900
Wait, is this going to be like a maze?

867
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,060
No.

868
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,520
Oh, my God.

869
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,420
I'm teeny tiny.

870
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,240
I'm just a little mouse.

871
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,440
Oh, shoot.

872
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,700
Wait, there's...

873
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,900
I don't even know where...

874
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,200
Oh, my God.

875
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:55,900
Oh, my God.

876
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,320
Stop coming at me.

877
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,240
Okay.

878
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,000
The shifts were getting more severe.

879
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,800
Yeah, the game is getting more severe.

880
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:12,680
Where I got smaller.

881
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,480
The signal was going haywire.

882
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,660
I would have to find my way out of here on my own.

883
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,440
Oh, my God.

884
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,210
Turn it around all dramatically.

885
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:27,970
Like, huh?

886
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,770
Oh, my gosh.

887
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,910
Yeah, the difficulty spike is kind of crazy.

888
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:36,670
I don't know if I'm cut out for this, you guys.

889
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,030
I'm Alan weak.

890
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,490
I don't know if I cut out for this.

891
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:58,130
Okay, I'll just have to assume as I get to these guys, just
flare it up, baby.

892
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,130
Flare it up.

893
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,400
Oh, oh, I'm accidentally hitting things.

894
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,580
Ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

895
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,400
Flare.

896
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,900
I feel like I'm wasting my flares, though.

897
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,380
This guy, this guy is a big guy.

898
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,500
Oh, you're still here?

899
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,860
It's nice that they activate so easily, but I feel like I
also have to not waste them.

900
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,240
Alright, I'm letting my Oh, I hear him.

901
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:52,920
Oh, no!

902
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,760
Dang it!

903
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,840
See you like that!

904
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,720
I hear more of him.

905
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,480
Oh, shoot!

906
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,250
He got his butt.

907
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,160
I think I hear more.

908
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:11,960
Alan weak?

909
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,200
No, you're mean to strength!

910
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,300
Ah!

911
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,210
Dang it!

912
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,400
I tried to run out of the way.

913
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,460
I can't believe he didn't get hit by a single...

914
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,120
One of those, though.

915
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,240
I cannot believe.

916
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,920
She didn't get hit by a single one.

917
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,500
I think I just have to keep going.

918
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,340
I think I just have to keep running.

919
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,520
Oh my gosh.

920
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,000
Wait.

921
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:05,560
Blast.

922
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,140
Blast.

923
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,280
There we go.

924
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,100
Okay.

925
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,720
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

926
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:11,740
I see it.

927
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,380
Alan, climb!

928
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:13,820
Climb!

929
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,600
We made it!

930
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,960
Maybe, I hope.

931
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,240
Okay, we made it.

932
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,660
Helen, climb!

933
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,000
Zane left me a page.

934
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,740
He was trying to help me.

935
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,740
He did?

936
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:37,800
Oh.

937
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,700
Whoa.

938
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,060
Scream?

939
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,420
Tremor?

940
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:49,700
Wall?

941
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,880
What's the wall for?

942
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,760
Cool.

943
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,620
Oh.

944
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,360
Uh...

945
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:00,820
Friend!

946
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,400
Ah, nice!

947
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,860
Alan Friend!

948
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,420
Barry!

949
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,100
Yauza!

950
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,300
Hey, bestseller!

951
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,600
Looking good!

952
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,340
Barry!

953
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,540
Well, no shit, what gave me away?

954
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,700
For the see-through thing?

955
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,640
I'm a figment of your imagination.

956
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,780
Just like pretty much everything else you see here.

957
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,620
Maybe even you.

958
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:32,600
yeah you're right everything that happened before made
perfect sense but this is insane good catch i'm glad that

959
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:43,640
barry tells it to him straight i gotta get going the gps
yeah i know follow the signal got it oh it's the fact that

960
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:53,100

you the thing is you need to get a grip all right you nagged

961
00:57:53,100 --> 00:58:00,760

962
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:08,500

to stay on the ball here you need to do what Zane tells you

963
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:16,660
uh-huh he's been here for ages he's like the expert I'm
curious what scream is should we try it what if we get

964
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:23,040
ambushed though I'm scared anyway if This is insane and it's
all from your mind.

965
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,800
Never call yourself Alan.

966
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,440
We- Alan believe in you.

967
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,040
Alan, bye-bye for now.

968
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,120
Thank you, Vin!

969
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,320
We scream.

970
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,720
Don't shit a shitter, Al.

971
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,600
Deep down, you're always happy to see me.

972
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,940
Can't lie to yourself.

973
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,600
Know what I'm saying?

974
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,740
There must be a sucker for punishment.

975
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:41,680
You?

976
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,380
No, really?

977
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,500
And I always thought you went out of your way to avoid
trouble.

978
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,700
Thanks.

979
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,660
Thanks for that.

980
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,580
Don't be a shit shitter.

981
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:57,680
Flashlight.

982
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,960
Oh, do we get a better one here?

983
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:00,620
Like the torch?

984
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,560
Kick.

985
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,360
Alan.

986
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,300
Kick!

987
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,540
Oh, the lantern.

988
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,700
There it is.

989
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,580
No other words!

990
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,140
Oh, Alan recharge!

991
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,520
I can try the tremor one.

992
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,300
Give me a second.

993
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,900
We can go back, probably.

994
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,620
I know there was another box that dropped.

995
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:34,000
Where'd it go?

996
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,880
Wait, where'd my second box go?

997
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:38,920
Another box dropped.

998
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,200
I saw two of them.

999
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,380
Where'd it go?

1000
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,320
A noclip out of existence?

1001
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,340
Will you be playing Control?

1002
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,760
I think you'd like the creepiness?

1003
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,120
I think it'd be fine.

1004
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,480
Uh, I...

1005
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,340
I think I'll probably do it before Alan Wake, too.

1006
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:06,940
Wait,

1007
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,450
I think I actually did something.

1008
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:12,490
Wait, what's happening?

1009
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,550
Wait, uh, I think I...

1010
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:16,370
You guys, I think...

1011
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:16,670
Uh-oh.

1012
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,490
Uh-oh.

1013
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:20,850
Yowza.

1014
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:29,530
I mean, I played Alan Wake 1, so I could play Alan Wake 2,
so...

1015
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,340
Oh, gosh.

1016
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,660
I have no flares.

1017
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:38,560
FYI.

1018
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,040
I have no flares.

1019
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:41,640
Boom!

1020
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,480
Can I reach?

1021
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,440
Can I snipe that?

1022
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:45,820
Dang.

1023
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,280
I think the signal's pointing towards that thing in the
distance.

1024
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,260
Yeah.

1025
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,180
That'd be the Biltmore sawmill.

1026
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,940
How the hell do you know that?

1027
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,840
I don't know anything you don't.

1028
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,040
So why don't you ask yourself that?

1029
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:00,780
Huh?

1030
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,360
Maybe you saw a sign for it back in the real world.

1031
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:10,480
You know what vibes he's giving me is in Twilight when Bella
was hallucinating Edward.

1032
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:17,780
Like, she would get into dangerous situations because she
wanted to see Edward and was hallucinating him.

1033
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:31,080
And he's the fact that he just kind of, like, shows up out
of nowhere and is just like, boom, boom, boom.

1034
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:36,470
Oh.

1035
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,090
Mama!

1036
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:41,810
Hey, how?

1037
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:43,670
I guess the pen is mightier.

1038
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:45,250
If you complete that sentence, you're fired.

1039
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,290
Mightier than the sword.

1040
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:48,690
You're fired.

1041
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:49,650
Aw.

1042
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:50,610
No.

1043
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,330
You can't fire him.

1044
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:53,810
He...

1045
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,070
He literally...

1046
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:56,830
Is not real.

1047
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:01,370
What am I hearing?

1048
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,460
Oh, okay.

1049
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,860
I guess I needed a...

1050
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:12,780
It's

1051
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:25,360
okay!

1052
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,840
I'll probably die!

1053
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,220
Oh,

1054
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,000
I just reached a checkpoint.

1055
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,620
Oh, dang it.

1056
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:36,700
Dang it.

1057
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,460
Dang it.

1058
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,040
Dang it.

1059
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,520
Dang it.

1060
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,600
Let's make it all this sound!

1061
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,820
Oh my god!

1062
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,560
Oh my god, they really are like ghosts!

1063
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,020
Oh my god!

1064
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,520
Boom!

1065
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:07,500
Boom!

1066
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,120
Boom!

1067
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,770
Oh my god.

1068
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:17,610
Oh my god.

1069
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,560
They're still coming after me.

1070
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,060
Get them twice basically now!

1071
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,280
Oh man, it's over.

1072
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,160
I have to get them twice because they're gonna be shadows
and then I have to get them again.

1073
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:16,940
I was like, real?

1074
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,960
Oh my gosh.

1075
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,160
Yeah, I got wombo comboed hard there.

1076
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,360
Oh my god.

1077
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,560
Oh!

1078
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,720
They really do love to spawn behind me.

1079
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,380
Don't they realize you're a ghost too?

1080
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,920
I wish they would realize!

1081
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,620
Did the fireworks even do anything?

1082
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,500
I don't think it did.

1083
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,480
Oh, geez.

1084
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:50,120
This is stressing me out.

1085
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,060
Boom!

1086
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:52,960
Boom!

1087
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:54,300
What do you mean?

1088
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:54,800
Boom!

1089
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,200
Boom!

1090
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,440
Hard to tell since he was flared.

1091
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,440
Yeah, I threw out the flare because I was scared.

1092
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:17,970
How do I switch the difficulty?

1093
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:23,060
Oh my gosh!

1094
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,980
Oh, oh gosh.

1095
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:43,780
Where are they?

1096
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:44,800
Where are they?

1097
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,140
Where are they?

1098
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,560
No!

1099
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,210
I'm not doing a very good job at dodging anymore!

1100
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:10,350
Oh my god.

1101
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:16,650
Okay, I'm just gonna get these guys before I continue
onwards, because...

1102
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:17,150
Oh my god.

1103
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:18,250
Hello.

1104
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:23,790
Okay, so I don't have to get them twice, it's just I can't
see them as well.

1105
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:25,990
Is the issue.

1106
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,770
I can't see them so well because they're shadowy ghost guys.

1107
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,870
What if we go this way instead?

1108
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:37,550
Alan believe.

1109
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,750
It's tough to Alan believe.

1110
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,710
Whoa!

1111
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:44,970
Shit.

1112
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:46,350
Oh, they respawn.

1113
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,030
Oh, I'm so...

1114
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:48,890
Oh, it's so over.

1115
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:50,670
Oh my god.

1116
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:51,590
Wait, what's happening?

1117
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,590
Why am I in slow-mo?

1118
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,080
Oh.

1119
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,340
Oh, bad.

1120
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,200
Oh, bad.

1121
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,060
Oh, bad.

1122
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:04,830
Oh, gosh.

1123
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:11,870
Alan's struggle.

1124
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,070
Alan's struggle.

1125
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,270
Wait, I thought there were...

1126
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,930
Oh, I was gonna say I thought there were two flares.

1127
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,670
In the visible man.

1128
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:23,790
Sleeping in your bone.

1129
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:31,690
Thoughts, not thoughts!

1130
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:37,750
Where's the other guy at?

1131
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:38,810
Oh.

1132
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,590
Alan fireworks.

1133
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:01,930
Just in case.

1134
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,210
Alan tools.

1135
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,350
Oh, not Alan tools yet.

1136
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,200
Alan tools.

1137
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,520
Alan tools.

1138
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,120
Please.

1139
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,180
Why did they have to drop everywhere?

1140
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,120
So rude.

1141
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,140
So, so rude.

1142
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,700
It's just a bunch of ammo, isn't it?

1143
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:34,420
Ah!

1144
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,680
Ah!

1145
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,000
Shit, shit, shit!

1146
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,420
Alan boom!

1147
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:42,980
Oh, Alan!

1148
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:43,600
Oh

1149
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,330
my- I think there was one more guy though.

1150
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,670
Oh, you.

1151
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:51,790
Stop dodging me!

1152
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:53,950
Alan,

1153
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,150
not boom yet.

1154
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,110
Uh, Alan lost.

1155
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:12,610
Alan tools?

1156
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,170
Uh, Alan go through.

1157
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:19,870
Alan through?

1158
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:31,770
Alan flash Oh my god Oh my god Oh my god Oh my god Oh my god

1159
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,500
I like to imagine Alan calling out his

1160
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:54,890
Alan's trash

1161
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:04,250
Oh Oh Oh

1162
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,960
There's no chance

1163
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:42,070
point this DLC is utter chaos I know my goodness oh my god I
think it helps me focus too and I call out the moves when

1164
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:48,480
I'm like when I'm like Alan boob it helps

1165
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:14,380
I saw someone say I tried to warn her But not enough people
tried to warn me I don't think I saw I wish more people told

1166
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,460
me that the DLCs were a doozy

1167
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,600
Not enough one guys

1168
01:11:49,200 --> 01:12:04,240
Oh Okay can switch to easy for this is there like i mean i
did click normal i don't know if it would be the same or not

1169
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:10,880
oh i have to restart i don't know how far we are in

1170
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:22,170
no no no

1171
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:56,010
at least here i'm blocked by the rock right you

1172
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,810
guys all have the same outfit on it's It's really
embarrassing!

1173
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,000
We'll go the right way this time.

1174
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,420
Alan?

1175
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:17,840
Fireworks!

1176
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,740
Ow, Joe, Joe!

1177
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,220
The fireworks did not work!

1178
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,460
Alan dodge!

1179
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:30,260
Alan, oh, but these guys are still gonna come after me.

1180
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:30,940
Oh.

1181
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,480
Who was throw in there?

1182
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,700
Oh, there's still a shadow guy.

1183
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,020
Okay, Alan go.

1184
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,600
Alan reload.

1185
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,020
I still have two flares now, so...

1186
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,740
I get hurt by that.

1187
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,820
I'm... Alan lost.

1188
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:01,840
Ah!

1189
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,110
There's another guy here?

1190
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:22,130
The thing is, is I can't go too far or they'll start like
ambushing me, you know?

1191
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,420
Visual glitch.

1192
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,800
I only have two bullets left.

1193
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,300
Uh-oh.

1194
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,120
We're just going to keep going this way.

1195
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,440
Wait, there's a light there.

1196
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:48,540
Alan baboon.

1197
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,560
I don't know if that did anything.

1198
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,620
Oh, you know what?

1199
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,060
Screw it.

1200
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:57,380
I don't care.

1201
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,160
Alan run to the light.

1202
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,380
Please be a checkpoint.

1203
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,880
It's a checkpoint!

1204
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,450
Alan?

1205
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:09,730
Turret?

1206
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:12,810
Alan Bridge?

1207
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:18,290
Okay.

1208
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:21,190
We at least reached the checkpoint.

1209
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,230
The other way it was a lie.

1210
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:25,790
The other way was... was...

1211
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:29,550
You know, you're gonna have to make your way across here.

1212
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:33,570
The solution probably has something to do with those words.

1213
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:36,390
No way.

1214
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,490
Yeah, you should probably use them.

1215
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,610
Your insight is staggering.

1216
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,350
I think I'm getting ambushed.

1217
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:44,190
What?

1218
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:49,630
Oh, sorry, I thought I heard like a...

1219
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,070
Like, it sounds like people are coming up behind me.

1220
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,030
If you come up behind me.

1221
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,930
They wouldn't be so rude to do that, were they?

1222
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:08,650
Oh, shoot.

1223
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:15,430
Come on.

1224
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,450
There we go.

1225
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:23,680
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1226
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,540
See, this is the way things should be.

1227
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,500
I give advice and you fall.

1228
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,780
That's when things go right.

1229
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,760
You get up to something on your own, that's when the trouble
starts.

1230
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,560
That's horseshit.

1231
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,020
I just saw another...

1232
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:40,840
Figment.

1233
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:41,580
Remember?

1234
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:42,960
Figment.

1235
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:45,820
Figment.

1236
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,260
Wait.

1237
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,000
Oh, okay, I'm here.

1238
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,140
Some of my tools fell off!

1239
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,480
Figment?

1240
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,980
I think I need to use my shotgun though.

1241
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,220
They wouldn't show up behind me, right?

1242
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,360
Dark Souls would like to know your location.

1243
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:08,820
Oh no.

1244
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,020
Quake's own words.

1245
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,000
Littering the landscape.

1246
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,600
His books common and discarded.

1247
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,680
Like mud beneath his feet.

1248
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:17,940
Hardbacks.

1249
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,960
Turned against him.

1250
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:21,740
Trash.

1251
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,380
Turned against him.

1252
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,120
I had seen weird transmissions of myself before.

1253
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:27,640
Like that?

1254
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,500
Book right there?

1255
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:28,780
This?

1256
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,400
The version of myself I saw now sounded insane.

1257
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,480
Like a demented storyteller.

1258
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,620
What's 9 for 10?

1259
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:38,760
21.

1260
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,020
Baby, thank you.

1261
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,920
So now my books are even gonna be attacking me.

1262
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:48,280
Sticks and stones may break my bow.

1263
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:48,940
Oh my god.

1264
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,920
They fall from the sky like crazy.

1265
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,220
But my books would never hurt me!

1266
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,020
Okay, I'm following the signal.

1267
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,200
Oh, gosh.

1268
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,080
It's raining!

1269
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,020
Alan Wake!

1270
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:10,810
Oh, okay.

1271
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,110
What the hell is this?

1272
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:18,110
Oh, the books!

1273
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:21,410
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1274
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:40,170

Oh, my...

1280
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:47,470
Is there a way to turn off auto-aim like that?

1281
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:49,470
It's driving me insane.

1282
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,290
How do I turn it off?

1283
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:57,230
The game's...

1284
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,390
Controls, maybe.

1285
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:00,270
Direct aiming?

1286
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:01,530
Disabled!

1287
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,690
It's not even on!

1288
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:12,760
Maybe...

1289
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,100
Don't play with controller.

1290
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,160
Was this game not made for...

1291
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:17,640
controller?

1292
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,340
Oh, direct equals manual.

1293
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:22,860
Oh, okay.

1294
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:23,600
Phew, shoo, shoo.

1295
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,320
Is this?

1296
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,840
It was.

1297
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,140
It was.

1298
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,720
It came out on Xbox originally.

1299
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,140
Okay.

1300
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,760
I'm so used to playing these kinds of games.

1301
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,140
I know it's, like, more difficult.

1302
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,540
I'm literally making it more difficult for myself.

1303
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,260
But, like, also the sensitivity.

1304
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,600
Oh, do you see this?

1305
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,340
I don't think I can play with my mouse.

1306
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,720
What the hell is this?

1307
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:58,020
This is the sensitivity we'd be playing with.

1308
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,240
Alright.

1309
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:07,740
Anyway, let me move my...

1310
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:08,160
Oh my gosh.

1311
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,100
I can't move my mouse out of the way now.

1312
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,040
Alright, back to the game.

1313
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:12,940
Oh my gosh.

1314
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,200
Wait, I think I...

1315
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,900
Guys, I'm so sorry.

1316
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,920
I can't move my mouse now.

1317
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,380
I'm really sorry.

1318
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:22,600
Hold

1319
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:26,620
on.

1320
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:27,560
Maybe if I do this.

1321
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,180
Oh.

1322
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,390
I, it's, it, no matter.

1323
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:47,410
I tried all tabbing into it.

1324
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:49,530
It doesn't work.

1325
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:53,860
Maybe.

1326
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:54,880
Oh, if I do that.

1327
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:55,780
No!

1328
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:56,920
Why?

1329
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,480
Why?

1330
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,340
Why?

1331
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,960
Oh, my gosh.

1332
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:01,740
Alan glitch.

1333
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:03,800
Okay.

1334
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:08,420
Accompanied by a ghostly version of Barry, Wake attempts to
reach the sawmill.

1335
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,760
I think I'm just gonna have to...

1336
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,040
Okay.

1337
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,900
Now there's two ghosts instead of...

1338
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,420
Yeah, there's more than one.

1339
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:38,680
There's...

1340
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,220
There's Barry and there's me.

1341
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:42,980
In the middle of the screen.

1342
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,180
It's cute having a tiny minke on screen.

1343
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,540
I'm glad you think so.

1344
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,500
Those are bad words.

1345
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,480
Bad words.

1346
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,280
Ouch!

1347
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,240
I can't move.

1348
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,280
I'm stuck.

1349
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,080
Hold on, I'm trying to get over here.

1350
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,610
I think I should just run for it.

1351
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:27,250
Honestly.

1352
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:34,870
I think I should just run for it.

1353
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:57,740
and also do you see that when i aim oh it's going where my
mouse is the game is actually trying to sabotage me okay

1354
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:03,960
hold on i'm quitting i'm quitting the game real quick not
not quit quit but i need to quit i need to restart the game

1355
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:14,360
it's like oh everything is bad everything is so bad
Everything is so bad!

1356
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,560
Oh!

1357
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:30,490
Okay.

1358
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,610
Continue.

1359
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:33,510
Okay.

1360
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,070
Let's see.

1361
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:37,190
Alright.

1362
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:44,550
Do you guys want video commentary?

1363
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,010
Direct aiming.

1364
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:49,770
Enabled.

1365
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:50,530
Yeah, yeah.

1366
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:54,090
I don't think Ravenholm was this man.

1367
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:55,890
I think.

1368
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:05,300
Oh, no!

1369
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:05,660
Wait!

1370
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,800
It did it again though!

1371
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,230
It did it again though!

1372
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:16,450
It aimed at the enemy!

1373
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:17,850
It didn't aim...

1374
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:18,050
Oh.

1375
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:24,310
Okay.

1376
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,340
What the... Oh, sorry.

1377
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:31,660
The word hurt me.

1378
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,980
Those are bad words.

1379
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,420
Bad words.

1380
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:43,920
Ow,

1381
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,600
shit!

1382
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,220
I got a stinking achievement.

1383
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:02,760
It's so funny.

1384
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,140
It's so funny.

1385
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,560
Stop, please.

1386
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,540
I'm gonna die.

1387
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,220
I'm about to die.

1388
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,120
I'm about to die.

1389
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,300
I'm about to die!

1390
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:20,730
Okay, I just need to take it easy right here.

1391
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:23,610
Okay, we're in a wall, so...

1392
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:24,950
I just need to take it easy for a second.

1393
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:26,030
Okay.

1394
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:27,090
Alright.

1395
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:29,330
Oh my gosh.

1396
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:30,330
Okay.

1397
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:31,530
Alright.

1398
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,430
Just need to take it easy.

1399
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,430
Don't fall off!

1400
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:51,170
Did...

1401
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,060
Oh my god.

1402
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:11,940
It's okay.

1403
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:13,860
The earth shook.

1404
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:18,160
Street lights pushed themselves up to the ground, flickering
madly.

1405
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,220
It's Spade Spark.

1406
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,180
In the shadow's wake saw far too many seconds.

1407
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,000
Go Pat!

1408
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,800
I don't know who's in the superb owl.

1409
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,220
Who is in there?

1410
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,260
Adolf, yeah.

1411
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,800
I say the same thing.

1412
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:36,620
Barry!

1413
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:39,660
Barry!

1414
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:41,180
This is just too weird.

1415
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,160
You're weird.

1416
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,000
Thank you, Barry.

1417
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,840
Is all this really coming out of my head?

1418
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,180
That's just the way this place is, Al.

1419
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,600
All that random stuff in your head?

1420
01:27:59,310 --> 01:27:59,710
No!

1421
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,480
How are each other?

1422
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:11,320
Where are they?

1423
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:11,600
Oh.

1424
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,000
Yeah.

1425
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,020
Yeah.

1426
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:25,640
Yeah.

1427
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:31,220
I just hear them dying behind me.

1428
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:31,940
Oh, shoot.

1429
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,020
I see these big guys.

1430
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:34,500
Yeah.

1431
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:36,400
Yeah.

1432
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:38,540
You too.

1433
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:40,080
Yeah.

1434
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,640
I gotta like, kind of Get them underneath.

1435
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,220
I gotta like blind them while they're underneath the thing,
you know?

1436
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:47,660
Lead them into there.

1437
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,060
Oh, no.

1438
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:48,640
Okay.

1439
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:49,360
Never mind.

1440
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,100
I'm just gonna get to you.

1441
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:52,720
There.

1442
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,100
Oh, yeah.

1443
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:01,500
Ouch, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1444
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:02,040
Come here.

1445
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:04,420
Oh, no, no.

1446
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:04,840
Dig it.

1447
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:05,340
Dig it.

1448
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:05,680
Dig it.

1449
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:05,860
Dig it.

1450
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,010
Me right now.

1451
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:21,910
Me right now.

1452
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:23,750
Oh, geez.

1453
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:26,050
Oh my god.

1454
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:29,410
My depth perception.

1455
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:33,090
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1456
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:33,970
Don't don't don't!

1457
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:35,710
I think I got it.

1458
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:37,410
I think I got it.

1459
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:40,410
Oh.

1460
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:46,850
Oh, yeah, the words, they hurt.

1461
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:48,550
The earth shook.

1462
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:48,990
Oh.

1463
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:54,030
Streetlights pushed themselves up to the ground, slickering
madly and spitting spark.

1464
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:56,310
And the shadow's wings saw far.

1465
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:58,230
Too many figures have had the ear.

1466
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:01,250
Okay, this is just too weird.

1467
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:02,270
You're weird.

1468
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:05,910
Barry, is all this really coming out of my head?

1469
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:08,270
That's just the way this place is, Al.

1470
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,690
All that random stuff in your head?

1471
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:11,910
Imagination.

1472
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,470
Sorry, I gotta go!

1473
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:16,770
This way?

1474
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,280
Oh, shoot!

1475
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,660
Did you just see him fly?

1476
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,060
That's so funny.

1477
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,280
Oh my gosh.

1478
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,340
Oh my gosh.

1479
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:39,840
Yes!

1480
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:42,040
Yes!

1481
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,740
Yes, sir.

1482
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,760
I think I'm going the right way.

1483
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:50,320
I think I'm going the right way.

1484
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,380
Oh shoot.

1485
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:58,840
Yeah!

1486
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,480
Not yeah!

1487
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,700
Just go, go, go, go, go, go.

1488
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:30,900
No!

1489
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:31,540
No!

1490
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,160
You can come here!

1491
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:40,860
Oh, no, no, actually, don't.

1492
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,200
No, my.

1493
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,680
Okay, I think I made it.

1494
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:45,420
Oh, my gosh.

1495
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,000
I did.

1496
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:46,400
I made it.

1497
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:46,760
I made it.

1498
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:47,160
I made it.

1499
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,300
Oh, my God.

1500
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,440
We just gotta keep going.

1501
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,260
The whole thing is just keep moving.

1502
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,060
Don't stop.

1503
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:56,400
Like, you can't focus on enemies for too long.

1504
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,900
Because they just don't stop.

1505
01:31:59,040 --> 01:31:59,920
They just don't stop.

1506
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:01,420
Wheels?

1507
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,200
Oh!

1508
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:09,680
Oh!

1509
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,480
I need to get that door open before you can get into the
warehouse.

1510
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,980
That's the way forward.

1511
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:21,700
If I'm making this up, why is it so complicated?

1512
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,820
Yeah, that's why I'm wondering.

1513
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,580
Because you're a complicated man, and no one understands
you.

1514
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,140
But I'm talking...

1515
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:29,360
Yeah, Barry.

1516
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,260
Just blip out of existence, please.

1517
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,700
Why is this so complicated?

1518
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:40,020
You know, Alan Wake, I have a lot of questions for you.

1519
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:41,560
Oh.

1520
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,300
What just exploded over there?

1521
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,500
Oh, whoops.

1522
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,140
Can we start over?

1523
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,080
I'm stuck.

1524
01:32:58,220 --> 01:32:59,240
I'm literally trapped.

1525
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:00,480
Oh, shoot.

1526
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,480
My car is broken, though.

1527
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,140
Can we start over?

1528
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,600
I didn't know what this was.

1529
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,040
Oh, my God.

1530
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:11,820
And there's guys.

1531
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:12,680
Just kill me.

1532
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,160
Just kill me.

1533
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:13,540
Just kill me.

1534
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:14,100
Just kill me.

1535
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,080
Just kill me.

1536
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:17,820
Please just kill me.

1537
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,480
Just kill me.

1538
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:19,740
My car got stuck.

1539
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:30,800
I have to restart Redo Redo You need to get that door open
before you can get into the warehouse.

1540
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,960
That's the way forward If I'm making this up.

1541
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,140
Why is it so complicated?

1542
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:48,100
Because you're a complicated man and no one understands you
but I'm talking Oh, I think I There's like a thing over

1543
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:48,540
there.

1544
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:51,540
I think I accidentally...

1545
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,800
I didn't realize, because that's what exploded I think.

1546
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:58,160
I think I accidentally did it.

1547
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:04,370
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god,

1548
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:11,040
oh my god.

1549
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,700
Oh shoot, please!

1550
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:14,900
Ah!

1551
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,140
Oh my god, oh my god!

1552
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:22,500
It's a death, it's a death, it's a death for me, no!

1553
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,880
Oh my god!

1554
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,840
I was holding A after redoing it again.

1555
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:34,380
What the hell is all of this, you guys?

1556
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:38,440
You need to get that door open before you can get into the
way.

1557
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:39,320
Stop, I didn't even move!

1558
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:41,620
You jumped and it was your fault!

1559
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,260
Why is it so complicated?

1560
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,880
Because you're a complicated man and no one understands you.

1561
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,160
Don't try to fight yet.

1562
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,820
Yeah, I think I learned that.

1563
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:50,680
I tried before.

1564
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:54,800
I just tried now because the first time I didn't really have
a fair fight.

1565
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,300
But this time, we're just going to go for it.

1566
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,460
I'm just gonna go...

1567
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,970
Wait, is this where I'm supposed to go?

1568
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,030
Oh, jeez!

1569
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:11,530
I'm stuck?

1570
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:19,660
Okay!

1571
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:25,840
Heels?

1572
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:28,280
Oh, wheels.

1573
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,540
Another car.

1574
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:30,400
Pump?

1575
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:33,960
What's up?

1576
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,820
I forgot there's guys here too.

1577
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,120
Oh my god.

1578
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,380
I'm just gonna...

1579
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:43,020
Leave me alone.

1580
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:44,740
Leave me alone.

1581
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:47,000
Getting back in.

1582
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:49,460
I'm getting back in the car.

1583
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:50,380
And I'm going.

1584
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,640
Getting back in the car and I'm going.

1585
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:55,760
Oh, shoot.

1586
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,360
Yeah, so true.

1587
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:01,560
Please get in.

1588
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:02,180
Please get in.

1589
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,100
No, please.

1590
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,220
Oh, I can't get in.

1591
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:07,960
That's right!

1592
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,400
That's right!

1593
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,200
Oh,

1594
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,500
that's not a, that's not an explodey barrel.

1595
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:36,320
Oh, that's fine.

1596
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,460
We'll get more batteries.

1597
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,820
How do I get up there?

1598
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,320
Alan jump.

1599
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:45,600
Alan jump.

1600
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,720
Uh, Alan find a way around.

1601
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,840
Alan explore.

1602
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:54,280
Uh.

1603
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,340
That was badass, thank you.

1604
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:03,140
That was like the perfect way to use the flare gun, no?

1605
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,240
That was like the perfect way to use it.

1606
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:13,080
I don't think I could have gotten a better shot unless I had
gotten that last guy.

1607
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,800
I didn't think everybody would die.

1608
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,660
I didn't think I would hit them all.

1609
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:28,600
Flare.

1610
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:29,620
Hunt?

1611
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,580
What the hell does that mean?

1612
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:33,840
What does hunt mean?

1613
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,660
You're gonna give me only one?

1614
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:36,380
Stenji.

1615
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,940
Oh, maybe like the hunting rifle.

1616
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,320
Probably.

1617
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:43,340
Right?

1618
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:44,420
Hunting rifle?

1619
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:47,820
Hunting rifle.

1620
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:49,960
Hunting rifle.

1621
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,240
It was it?

1622
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,440
Oh, it was.

1623
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:56,740
It was.

1624
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:58,720
I'm so scared for a second.

1625
01:37:59,180 --> 01:37:59,940
Wait, but...

1626
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:07,410
5 versus how many bullets do I have with the shotgun?

1627
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:08,410
11.

1628
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:15,130
I just got more shotgun ammo too.

1629
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:18,010
I was going to lose it.

1630
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:20,770
Especially because something happened and like disappeared.

1631
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:26,550
Yeah, I thought like I was about to get hunted or something.

1632
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:29,050
Oh, there's our checkpoint.

1633
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,750
Nice.

1634
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,240
Hey, what are you up to?

1635
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,540
I thought this was my side of the bed.

1636
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:42,240
Oh.

1637
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,020
That's it.

1638
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:50,280
Just thinking about my hot wife.

1639
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,820
Don't mind me.

1640
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:57,960
Oh, no.

1641
01:38:59,320 --> 01:38:59,760
What?

1642
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,260
Surrounded by enemies.

1643
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,660
Wake had nowhere to run.

1644
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,980
I'm so sick of you.

1645
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:08,580
I might.

1646
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:16,640
I

1647
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:21,960
need to switch to you.

1648
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,140
I have nothing.

1649
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:25,980
I have...

1650
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:26,660
Oh my god.

1651
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:27,940
I can't even dodge.

1652
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,380
Oh, what the hell is happening?

1653
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:36,080
Oh my god.

1654
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,060
I'm about to fall off.

1655
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:38,080
I'm about to fall off.

1656
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:51,640
Guys...

1657
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,240
I don't think the DLC is very fun.

1658
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,480
Hey, what are you up to?

1659
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,580
I thought this was my side of the bed.

1660
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,880
Guys, I think the DLC is hard.

1661
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:10,200
Guys, sure does it look like it?

1662
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,140
Hold on.

1663
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:25,430
Change the easy.

1664
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:28,070
I think I would have to restart the whole game.

1665
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:32,110
I would have to restart.

1666
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:33,130
You don't understand.

1667
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:35,890
If I change the easy, I have to go through everything.

1668
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:37,890
all over again.

1669
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:48,290
Second DLC story is better on easy.

1670
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:49,850
It will probably be better paced.

1671
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:52,310
Oh, man.

1672
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,880
Trying to decide what to do.

1673
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,000
I know.

1674
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,380
I feel really... I feel deep enough in it that I don't want
to quit.

1675
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:08,260
You know what I mean?

1676
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,420
But I'm at the same time.

1677
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:10,220
I'm like, man.

1678
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,240
Oh, geez.

1679
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,830
I'm almost done, I am.

1680
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:26,150
How much further do I have to go?

1681
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:30,970
I don't want to be, like, feeling so frustrated because I
don't think that's fun to watch, you know what I mean?

1682
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:35,550
But at the same time, I don't want to quit because I am
stubborn like that.

1683
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:40,010
If I set my mind to do something, I'm like, I want to see it
through.

1684
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:42,350
But at the same time, I'm like, God dang.

1685
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:58,500
Okay, what I'll try to do is I'll try to run through and
flare and do the climb and run.

1686
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:08,510
Shut up.

1687
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:10,250
Shut up.

1688
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:10,890
Shut up.

1689
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:12,530
Shut up.

1690
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:13,190
Shut up.

1691
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:15,070
Shut up.

1692
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:17,050
Shut up!

1693
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:18,070
Oh my god.

1694
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:18,510
What's happening?

1695
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:19,890
Shut up!

1696
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:21,010
Shut up!

1697
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,590
Ouch!

1698
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:22,490
Shut up.

1699
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:41,450
I am, might become the Joker.

1700
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:42,990
Joker.

1701
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:46,830
No, no, no, no, no!

1702
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:48,130
No!

1703
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:49,490
He

1704
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:13,920
entered the trap surrounded by enemies.

1705
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:16,320
Wake it no where you run.

1706
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,920
I'm so sick of you!

1707
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,840
And I'm so sick of you!

1708
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:21,800
Drudge!

1709
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:22,160
Josh!

1710
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:22,720
Josh!

1711
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:22,940
Allen!

1712
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:28,840
Allen run and Allen dodge and- Oh shh!

1713
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:31,780
I- Allen get completely stuck behind a pole.

1714
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,260
Minto, you want to know how I got these scars?

1715
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:53,320
Let's listen to my wife and be it calmed by the sound of a
woman.

1716
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,740
Hey, what are you up to?

1717
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:58,020
I thought this was my side of the bed.

1718
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,160
I'm sorry.

1719
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,020
The abrupt cutoff.

1720
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:10,080
The abrupt cutoff of the...

1721
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,580
Of the...

1722
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:13,580
Oh shit.

1723
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,260
Of the song was too funny.

1724
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:18,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1725
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:19,080
Okay.

1726
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,420
I don't think I'm like...

1727
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:24,180
Okay, come on, please.

1728
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,820
Please, please, please, God.

1729
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:28,000
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
please, please.

1730
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,040
Oh, thank goodness.

1731
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,880
They can't climb too, can they?

1732
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:37,920
Or...

1733
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:42,790
Oh, I got the checkpoint!

1734
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:44,130
Okay, nice.

1735
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:45,710
Oh.

1736
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:47,990
Heavy-duty lantern.

1737
01:44:49,410 --> 01:44:50,650
I'm holding B?

1738
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,430
Or is that what I already have?

1739
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:54,930
Is mine heavy duty?

1740
01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:58,150
Is it...

1741
01:44:58,150 --> 01:44:58,950
No, please.

1742
01:44:59,070 --> 01:44:59,710
I'm holding down.

1743
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:00,250
There we go.

1744
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:01,570
Oh, okay.

1745
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:03,370
Okay.

1746
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:04,070
Flare.

1747
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:11,160
Oh, that's never a good sound, is it?

1748
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:13,460
Barry, I could really use your help!

1749
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:20,960
a single flare a single flare

1750
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:38,400

Oh!

1754
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:04,070
Is that...

1755
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,690
Where is he?

1756
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:07,890
Wait, is that not him?

1757
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:09,510
Right here?

1758
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,380
I hit it out of desperation.

1759
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:44,420
Is that it?

1760
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,240
Hold on.

1761
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:51,740
That was it?

1762
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,620
That was it?

1763
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,080
There's a clock!

1764
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:58,780
Ah!

1765
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:00,840
Oh, I heard it earlier.

1766
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,800
Like at the beginning of the game, I didn't realize it was a
collectible.

1767
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,400
Oh, interesting.

1768
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:10,100
Alan Kitch.

1769
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:14,100
Oh.

1770
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:21,990
I'm just gonna quarter myself and wait for them to come to
me.

1771
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:23,670
Ah!

1772
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:24,990
Oh god!

1773
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:26,230
Make it climb!

1774
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:37,430
Hello,

1775
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:46,960
what's it called guys again?

1776
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,220
The salary man.

1777
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:49,340
Oh, my

1778
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:53,380
God.

1779
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:55,600
Oh, they can climb.

1780
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:56,240
Oh,

1781
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:01,090
my God.

1782
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:01,390
Wait.

1783
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:12,200
Strong.

1784
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:14,200
Too strong.

1785
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,460
Too strong.

1786
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:20,960
Okay, let's switch back to this.

1787
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,000
Oh, my God.

1788
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:28,780
You scared me.

1789
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,360
Well, my allergies are...

1790
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:36,460
I guess I need to say flares.

1791
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,320
You scared me.

1792
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:43,540
You scared me, Perry.

1793
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,700
This place is setting off my allergies.

1794
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:01,370
Um...

1795
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:03,750
My allergies, so true.

1796
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:06,490
My Alan Wake allergies.

1797
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:34,180
Chain reaction.

1798
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,880
Yeah, it was kind of awesome.

1799
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,280
I'm following the GPS signal.

1800
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,920
Follow the GPS signal, they said.

1801
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,880
Just keep following the GPS signal.

1802
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:49,860
Oh, we got another memory.

1803
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,540
We get another bridge.

1804
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,120
And another bridge.

1805
01:49:57,330 --> 01:49:58,930
I'm allergic to hack riders.

1806
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:01,350
Uh, where did it go?

1807
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:07,010
Okay.

1808
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,590
Memory.

1809
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:15,600
Is it my wife?

1810
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,700
It's my wife.

1811
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:19,820
Stop it!

1812
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:21,840
They're waiting for us downstairs.

1813
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,980
We don't have time for Alan.

1814
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:24,660
Alan!

1815
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:27,920
I knew she wasn't really here, but she still made my
heartache.

1816
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,040
I had saved Alice.

1817
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,440
But I wasn't even sure when that happened.

1818
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,600
Was it days ago?

1819
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:36,520
weeks, longer, I had no way of knowing.

1820
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:42,180
Oh, yeah, this is why.

1821
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,480
What is happening?

1822
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:47,920
Oh, this thing.

1823
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:51,160
Okay?

1824
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:55,260
Oh, uh, uh.

1825
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,460
Whoa, that's fast.

1826
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,840
Guess you gotta run, Al.

1827
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:01,000
Oh, thanks!

1828
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,640
We gotta push this first.

1829
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:05,220
There we go.

1830
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:09,220
Alan's a dog.

1831
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:16,820
Running, running, running, running, running, running.

1832
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:19,020
I bought.

1833
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:23,940
Thanks, Barry.

1834
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,620
Alan, I'm trying to feel bad for you, but it ain't easy.

1835
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,920
Oh my god.

1836
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,160
Are you kidding me right now?

1837
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:32,500
Wait.

1838
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:34,760
Am I stuck on this thing?

1839
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:35,580
Oh.

1840
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:36,800
Oh.

1841
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:37,540
Wait.

1842
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:37,960
Ah!

1843
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,640
Oh, okay.

1844
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:42,000
That's fine.

1845
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:45,640
Oh, shit.

1846
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,300
Oh, shit.

1847
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:47,600
I'm gonna fall off this thing.

1848
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:54,280
I thought for some reason it was gonna be like a moving
contraption.

1849
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:55,860
You know what I mean?

1850
01:51:56,260 --> 01:52:00,860
Where you dodge the enemies while it continues onwards.

1851
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:11,460
to someplace else I don't know why I assume that I was just
like okay we're gonna keep going down from this point we're

1852
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:20,400
gonna keep moving to the it literally stops right there like
I could see it I can literally see where it's supposed to

1853
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:27,480
stop I knew she wasn't really here but she still knew my
heartache I had saved Dallas but I wasn't even sure when

1854
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:32,700
that happened was it days ago weeks longer I had no way of
knowing.

1855
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,000
Everybody's talking over each other again.

1856
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:36,680
Alright.

1857
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,160
Let's switch to my...

1858
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,300
Revolver.

1859
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:44,660
Alright.

1860
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:45,380
Hey!

1861
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:58,500
Ah!

1862
01:52:59,340 --> 01:52:59,660
Dodge!

1863
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:01,540
Where'd that guy go?

1864
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:02,940
Wait, where'd he go?

1865
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:04,200
Oh.

1866
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,720
I did it?

1867
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:09,480
Okay.

1868
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,700
I did it.

1869
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:13,800
He just left.

1870
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,930
Maybe he ran off the side of the building like I did.

1871
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:20,560
Oh.

1872
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:22,900
How romantic.

1873
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,680
This music is killing me.

1874
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,120
Hey, lover.

1875
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:32,180
Come here.

1876
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:33,620
Hey, lover.

1877
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:36,100
I could only hope that Alice was all right.

1878
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:39,240
I didn't know what happened to her after she left the dark
place.

1879
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:40,980
Oh my gosh, it's so romantic.

1880
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:43,980
Yes, let us be guided by thoughts of our world.

1881
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:45,740
Yes!

1882
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:46,560
Oh.

1883
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:47,960
Zane?

1884
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:49,420
Is that you?

1885
01:53:53,970 --> 01:53:54,450
Inside?

1886
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,630
In here?

1887
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:00,750
Ouch.

1888
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:03,410
Hey, hold that pose.

1889
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:04,870
That was a good one.

1890
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:06,050
Like this?

1891
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:08,670
He's not doing anything.

1892
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:09,830
No, that's too much.

1893
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:11,230
He's just...

1894
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:11,250
Tough.

1895
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:15,350
You know how people go for those dangerous...

1896
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:17,730
He's not doing anything different.

1897
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:19,370
Oh, come on.

1898
01:54:19,450 --> 01:54:21,170
You write about terrible things all the time.

1899
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:24,090
People want to think that you're intimately familiar with
them.

1900
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:25,830
You kill Casey in this book.

1901
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:27,770
You need to look a little bit like a murderer.

1902
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:29,290
Oh, that's good.

1903
01:54:29,410 --> 01:54:30,250
Do that again.

1904
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:33,310
He hasn't changed at all.

1905
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:35,470
He hasn't changed anything.

1906
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:36,990
You know, I wasn't sure about to be here before, but I was
wrong.

1907
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:38,470
It looks good on you.

1908
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:38,870
Oh.

1909
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:41,450
Okay, I think we're going to...

1910
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:42,490
Alan, bad boy.

1911
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:44,050
I want to get out of this suit.

1912
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:46,750
Hey, things are looking up.

1913
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:57,750
danger is sexy oh oh that's so that was when i was still
working when i felt like a real writer instead of a fraud it

1914
01:54:57,750 --> 01:55:11,470
was a good memory i wished i hadn't seen it wait can i get
behind there i hear another clock somewhere you hear it is

1915
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:18,630
it inside checkpoint reached oh my goodness can't see
anything I think.

1916
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:21,430
Okay.

1917
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:24,850
Oh, this is kind of scary.

1918
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:27,390
I'm just gonna run for it.

1919
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:28,290
Oh!

1920
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:30,030
I'm in my apartment!

1921
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:35,430
Ow!

1922
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:36,490
Swah!

1923
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:39,170
Whoa.

1924
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:42,870
Oh, I hear it.

1925
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:43,770
It's right there.

1926
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,520
Yeah, we're home again!

1927
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,020
Wait, is our tiny...

1928
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:55,940
Aww, we can't see our tiny washing machine.

1929
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,540
This is like a final boss, they're giving me so much stuff.

1930
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:09,720
Guys, this was tough, but if this is closer to the end...

1931
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,880
We almost... we... you know, I'm proud of us.

1932
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:14,180
Stick it through it.

1933
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,420
Oh, I... Zane?

1934
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,900
Oh, it's Zane!

1935
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:19,100
You made it.

1936
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:23,020
This area of the dark place is calmer, at least for the time
being.

1937
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:29,180
We can talk here, but we don't have much time Zane how do I
get out of here?

1938
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,400
That's what you face.

1939
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:42,220
That's you even as we speak Darkness Darkness coming Swept
him away lost He knew he knew he couldn't hold on he knew

1940
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:43,260
there was no way out.

1941
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,720
Oh, no, I'm right here.

1942
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:52,360
That's not me It's just I don't know an echo a hallucination
the dark presence the dark presence is not responsible for

1943
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:54,120
this you are Me?

1944
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:56,120
I suck.

1945
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:02,000
I suck.

1946
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:03,000
I suck.

1947
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:06,700
Oh, we're like out of our apartment now.

1948
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:07,120
No!

1949
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,940
You get swallowed up in the rising tide of darkness.

1950
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:11,040
It was coming.

1951
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:12,420
It was coming.

1952
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:14,160
Shut up!

1953
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,420
Yeah, shut up!

1954
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:16,620
No!

1955
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:18,240
Alan, you must be.

1956
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:19,660
Just ignore him!

1957
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,520
Swept away by the gathering insanity.

1958
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:23,100
Zane was gone.

1959
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:26,700
Wait could feel the pressure, gnawing at his mind.

1960
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:28,220
The darkness wasn't so bad.

1961
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:29,520
It was in him.

1962
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,700
Why don't you just ignore him?

1963
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,800
It was just too hard to think.

1964
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:35,580
It can't.

1965
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:37,000
Couldn't make sense of it.

1966
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:37,420
Couldn't.

1967
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:39,100
You wanted to go with the flow.

1968
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,100
Stop thinking and just let go.

1969
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:45,140
Just be chill, Alan.

1970
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:46,060
Just be chill.

1971
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:49,320
Are we fighting Mecha Robot?

1972
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:59,330
It's Mecha Robot.

1973
01:57:59,390 --> 01:58:00,990
Alan Wake.

1974
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:09,380
Destroy the TVs!

1975
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:16,450
Okay.

1976
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:17,570
Where are they?

1977
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:18,250
Like, that guy?

1978
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:20,830
Okay.

1979
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:22,310
Wait, I think I go down.

1980
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:25,250
What the?

1981
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:28,510
What do I hear behind me?

1982
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,850
You hear that?

1983
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:32,370
I think it's downstairs, probably.

1984
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:34,590
Oh.

1985
01:58:35,070 --> 01:58:36,370
Oh, it's real dark down there.

1986
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:37,990
Guys, that don't look so good.

1987
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:39,430
them from here?

1988
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:46,930
Why does it do fall damage to me?

1989
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:49,930
Holy cow.

1990
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,020
Ouch.

1991
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,420
Oh, there's guys in here!

1992
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:06,640
Ouch!

1993
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,040
Ouch!

1994
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:08,280
Ouch!

1995
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:08,460
Ouch!

1996
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:11,020
I was hoping that...

1997
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:11,740
Oh my god.

1998
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:12,300
Oh my god.

1999
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:13,000
There's so much happening.

2000
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:16,720
I was hoping I'd be...

2001
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:19,160
The scope of this horror was unmasked.

2002
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:32,480
it would have been so much easier blocked by the pole is
what I was trying to say let's get ah die stop it oh I died

2003
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:39,920
my eyes oh the smoke is still here from the fight that I was
just doing

2004
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:54,630
okay okay I think what we'll do is this wait And then run
over here.

2005
01:59:55,590 --> 01:59:56,090
Oh, shoot.

2006
01:59:56,910 --> 01:59:57,790
Run behind the pole?

2007
01:59:58,110 --> 01:59:59,210
Ah, I can't see anything.

2008
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:00,670
My eyes.

2009
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:01,930
My heckin' eyes.

2010
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:02,970
Oh, my God.

2011
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:04,110
This guy's here, too.

2012
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:08,350
Okay.

2013
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:09,390
Oh, there's another guy.

2014
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:15,380
Oh, I got it, though.

2015
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:16,180
See that?

2016
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:17,080
With one player?

2017
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:18,640
I took out the whole thing.

2018
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:22,080
I might be pretty good.

2019
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,460
Oh my gosh.

2020
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:40,800
I'm just trying to move.

2021
02:00:41,540 --> 02:00:42,200
I'm just trying to move.

2022
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:50,480
I hit a barrel that I didn't know was freaking possessed.

2023
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:55,440
I didn't know it was possessed.

2024
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:00,020
I backed into a stinkin' barrel.

2025
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,640
Alan Tripp.

2026
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:03,980
Alright.

2027
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:07,700
Wait.

2028
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:17,880
There's another guy, right?

2029
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:19,040
Oh, shoot.

2030
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,680
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2031
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:23,020
I'm like trapped.

2032
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,940
Trying to use the things to my advantage.

2033
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:34,180
Where?

2034
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:35,100
Wait, where?

2035
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:35,640
Oh, you?

2036
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:39,460
Okay, let's get this too, since, uh, alright.

2037
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:46,240
Okay, I didn't get it one try this time, but, you know, it
is what it is.

2038
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:58,060
Oh my gosh.

2039
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,500
I don't want to waste it, though.

2040
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:09,740
Okay, there we go.

2041
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:11,740
Oh, there's another guy coming.

2042
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:13,340
I see you.

2043
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:19,730
Oh, my God.

2044
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:20,050
Ouch!

2045
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:26,460
I'm doing my best, guys.

2046
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:27,740
Holy cow.

2047
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:28,060
Okay.

2048
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:31,340
I think there was something here.

2049
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:31,740
Revolver.

2050
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:33,500
Okay, revolver, I'm wrong.

2051
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:34,860
Alright.

2052
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:36,120
Let's go in.

2053
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:38,940
Ouch!

2054
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,040
They just start moving!

2055
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:43,020
Oh my god, please!

2056
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:49,740
Thank you!

2057
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:51,260
Goodness gracious!

2058
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:53,740
Wait, was there...

2059
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:54,980
Oh, batteries, yes, yes, please.

2060
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:55,980
Please pick up the batteries.

2061
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:57,040
Please pick up the batteries.

2062
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:58,180
Please pick up the batteries.

2063
02:02:58,800 --> 02:02:59,020
Alright.

2064
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:06,540
We'll kind of like hide behind the bear.

2065
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:09,960
here and hope that I can get a good spot.

2066
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:11,540
Okay, no, I can't get a good spot.

2067
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:16,600
I'm literally shining my flashlight on it, but it refuses to
believe.

2068
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:19,640
There we go.

2069
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:20,480
All right.

2070
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:21,740
I think.

2071
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:24,520
Uh, all right, all right.

2072
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:26,780
There's something out.

2073
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:27,660
Oh, the barrel!

2074
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,160
The heckin' barrel.

2075
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:32,860
All right.

2076
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:34,580
All right.

2077
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:35,640
There's more?

2078
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:36,640
Or...

2079
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,160
Something.

2080
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:38,080
Oh, something else.

2081
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:38,240
Yeah.

2082
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,720
This guy.

2083
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:41,480
Alright.

2084
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:45,060
Let's clear out stuff before we...

2085
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:45,680
Alright.

2086
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:47,580
I'm going in!

2087
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:54,290
Oh, what am I supposed to be seeing?

2088
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:56,470
The barrel!

2089
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,160
Oh my god.

2090
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,680
Where'd the barrel go?

2091
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:04,540
I'm stuck.

2092
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:05,380
Okay.

2093
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2094
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:08,840
Oh, I don't have.

2095
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:11,700
Please.

2096
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:14,780
Oh my god, oh my god, please.

2097
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:15,900
Get the freaking barrel.

2098
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:16,640
Get the barrel!

2099
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:18,040
Alan, please!

2100
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:22,760
Oh my god.

2101
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:28,000
Okay, all right.

2102
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:29,480
Get this guy, get this guy.

2103
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:30,740
Okay, all right.

2104
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:31,740
Oh,

2105
02:04:53,050 --> 02:04:53,870
I reached the checkpoint!

2106
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:54,950
Oh, thank goodness.

2107
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:07,470
I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

2108
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:08,790
Uh, besides just...

2109
02:05:10,510 --> 02:05:12,690
Oops, I put in too many batteries.

2110
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:15,830
Pick up the flare, pick up the flare, pick up the batteries,
pick up the flare.

2111
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:32,890
Okay, Alan yelled.

2112
02:05:33,370 --> 02:05:34,450
Alan does everything.

2113
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:42,370
This is literally me the entire DLC.

2114
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:48,520
That was me the entire DLC.

2115
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:59,240
So in the end, I don't even like...

2116
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:07,260
I don't even get to get to release myself.

2117
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:09,420
I fall prey to the darkness.

2118
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:11,080
Because I'm stupid.

2119
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:15,060
Me playing the DLC.

2120
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:17,140
The Geek Squad.

2121
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:26,700
Release yourself how?

2122
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:28,180
We were listening to...

2123
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:28,840
What's his name?

2124
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:31,980
Oh my god.

2125
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:35,880
I did it!

2126
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:38,400
I beat the special episode one!

2127
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:48,580
Feels like that was a skippable DLC.

2128
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:49,660
I know!

2129
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:51,340
We didn't learn anything.

2130
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,440
We just learned that we were still trapped.

2131
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:56,400
I'm skipping the audio.

2132
02:06:56,980 --> 02:06:59,140
A friend indeed is what I gotta...

2133
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:03,540
We didn't learn anything.

2134
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:05,020
You learned pain.

2135
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:06,980
Oh my god.

2136
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:09,480
Oh my god.

2137
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,880
Holy cow.

2138
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:17,760
We learned that the dark place sucks ass.

2139
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:19,620
There's cheeks in here.

2140
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:20,500
Can't.

2141
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:23,260
Easy mode.

2142
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:24,900
You can't, you can't.

2143
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:34,290
Oh, jeez.

2144
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:40,530
Oh, Alan learns.

2145
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:44,150
They should call it the dork place.

2146
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:46,690
The second one is easier?

2147
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:47,670
Okay, thank you.

2148
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:51,110
Oh, maybe call it here.

2149
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,290
No, no, I think we can do this second one.

2150
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:55,210
Let me grab a snack real quick.

2151
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:56,950
I used up so much.

2152
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:58,570
You know what?

2153
02:07:59,030 --> 02:08:00,450
I got a donut earlier.

2154
02:08:01,070 --> 02:08:01,990
I'm going to go get it.

2155
02:08:02,190 --> 02:08:03,090
I'm going to go get my donut.

2156
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:04,150
I'll be right back.

2157
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:31,740
I was going to save this for tomorrow.

2158
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,660
I was like a treat to myself.

2159
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:38,060
And I think I deserve it right now.

2160
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:46,800
And then later, I'm going to get something else delicious.

2161
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:50,560
Alan's stress eat.

2162
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,660
I don't stress eat usually.

2163
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:58,160
But I feel I'm getting shaky, so I think I need some sugar.

2164
02:09:05,910 --> 02:09:06,450
Global Reset.

2165
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:09,090
This episode is Peak Sam Lake Cinema.

2166
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:11,930
Is it special too?

2167
02:09:12,030 --> 02:09:12,490
Okay, good.

2168
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:16,430
I'm excited then.

2169
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:28,580
You usually let yourself get shaky way more often.

2170
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:31,580
I just don't tell you guys.

2171
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:38,600
I just haven't mentioned it for a little while.

2172
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:47,720
But maybe it has happened less often.

2173
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:59,640
Oh, I think that episode, like, I didn't have to redo so
many parts over and over.

2174
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:00,320
Like, you know.

2175
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,020
It was just the stress of it all happening.

2176
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:09,520
Like, you know, I would have to be like, Alan do this, Alan
do that, Alan.

2177
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,600
Like, I was like, holy cow.

2178
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,340
Sugar and nap break.

2179
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:17,680
How are you doing today, Minto?

2180
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:18,620
I'm good.

2181
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:27,780
I pushed through.

2182
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:28,240
I did.

2183
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:30,580
I said I won't give up.

2184
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:32,660
That was close, though.

2185
02:10:36,180 --> 02:10:37,220
What kind of donut?

2186
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,860
It's a chocolate glazed donut.

2187
02:10:46,770 --> 02:10:50,290
I remember thinking that the first DLC was kind of nuts when
I first played it.

2188
02:10:52,510 --> 02:10:55,930
Is that like how Nightmare Mode kind of is?

2189
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:57,390
Or worse?

2190
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:59,190
Or is Nightmare Mode worse, I mean?

2191
02:10:59,410 --> 02:11:01,010
Not the DLC worse.

2192
02:11:01,470 --> 02:11:02,730
Nah, well, thank you so much for the thank you!

2193
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:05,990
Thank you, thank you.

2194
02:11:08,170 --> 02:11:09,670
Nightmare Mode is worse.

2195
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:29,160
I absolutely rage quit the first DLC during the invisible
guy's part Nightmare difficulty is like you pretty much have

2196
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:31,520
to dodge or you'll die Oh god

2197
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:49,990
Oh my thing is is I like games I like to play games you know
I'm not the best at games but I still enjoy myself but I am

2198
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:52,030
not sweaty with games You know what I mean?

2199
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:55,570
Like, I'm here to vibe and enjoy myself.

2200
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:58,370
And if there's a bit of a challenge, like, I'm okay with
that, usually.

2201
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:05,430
Um, but I, I'm like, you know, some people are, like, very
serious about how they play a game.

2202
02:12:06,610 --> 02:12:08,630
And for me, I'm just like, la la la.

2203
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:14,010
Immersive gameplay, the suffering happens directly to the
player.

2204
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:17,130
I feel like I got brain damage for real.

2205
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:19,290
Do you know that?

2206
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:20,810
Do you know that one sound?

2207
02:12:21,030 --> 02:12:21,350
Like, that's...

2208
02:12:21,370 --> 02:12:22,370
used in videos sometimes.

2209
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:31,550
I actually don't know what it's from, but it's like a girl
singing and she's like La la la la la la la la la la la la

2210
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:37,090
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la and then
they just start screaming.

2211
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:38,490
That's me.

2212
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:42,130
I feel like that's me in these types of games.

2213
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:55,590
At least you're not one of those people that throw their
controllers against the wall.

2214
02:12:55,930 --> 02:12:57,350
Yeah, I don't do that.

2215
02:12:59,470 --> 02:13:02,290
Alan Wake was their first try at story overshooting.

2216
02:13:02,490 --> 02:13:04,330
They got the balance right later games.

2217
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,810
I feel like this game has so much action.

2218
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:11,490
I feel like this game has a ton of action.

2219
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:14,510
Can I pay you to throw your controller?

2220
02:13:15,250 --> 02:13:16,550
No, I need it.

2221
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:19,270
I need my controller.

2222
02:13:20,170 --> 02:13:20,550
All right.

2223
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:22,930
I think I'm ready to...

2224
02:13:24,090 --> 02:13:24,570
Actually...

2225
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:30,580
a water bottle real quick.

2226
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:31,020
One second.

2227
02:13:32,420 --> 02:13:33,320
One second, one second.

2228
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:53,900
Okie dokie.

2229
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,120
Okie dokie.

2230
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:04,640
Let's get through episode... DLC episode 2, shall we?

2231
02:15:04,940 --> 02:15:05,900
On easy mode.

2232
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,000
Easy mode.

2233
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,520
No scatter!

2234
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:11,440
Come back!

2235
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:14,040
Alan hydrated.

2236
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:15,480
Alan drink.

2237
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:16,940
Alan kumpai!

2238
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:25,780
I mean, did you enjoy the main story?

2239
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:26,340
I did!

2240
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:29,560
I really like this game.

2241
02:15:31,940 --> 02:15:34,400
It's challenging sometimes, but I did enjoy myself.

2242
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:41,760
I did think, you know, even when I complained about parts of
the game, like, oh, I thought it was too repetitive, this

2243
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:42,480
and that, and this and that.

2244
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,140
It's not me saying that I disliked it.

2245
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:49,160
I did still like it.

2246
02:15:52,540 --> 02:16:03,380
to the rider previously on Alan Wake it's not a lake it's an
ocean after saving my wife from the mysterious dark presence

2247
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:09,620
I found myself trapped in the dark place imagination can be
the enemy here a nightmarish world that exists somewhere

2248
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:17,180
beyond the shores I could have just watched this just do
what Zane tells you follow the signal I could have just done

2249
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:22,380
all of I just could have just watched this I made my way
across its ever-shifting landscape trying to reach

2250
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,340
There's a town in Canada called Ninto?

2251
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:32,400
No way.

2252
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:37,740
Whoa.

2253
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:38,840
It's all in your head.

2254
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:40,720
You've been making it up.

2255
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:42,580
Who was that?

2256
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:43,300
Was that Barry?

2257
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:44,960
Really?

2258
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:45,900
Really?

2259
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:47,960
Your delusions are out of control.

2260
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:51,680
Leave my brain alone.

2261
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:52,620
Flip!

2262
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:55,060
You know reality's different here?

2263
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:57,340
Yeah.

2264
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:58,640
See what I mean?

2265
02:16:59,040 --> 02:16:59,480
Ow!

2266
02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:02,800
Oh, Barry's actually trying to help us out.

2267
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:06,580
No.

2268
02:17:06,580 --> 02:17:08,240
Well, you're gonna have to find your way out of there.

2269
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:09,120
I'll wait.

2270
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:12,140
Just remember, you're still in the dark place.

2271
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:13,360
You know that, right?

2272
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:17,140
I don't want to alarm you, pal, but it's sink or swim time.

2273
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:19,220
I get it, I get it.

2274
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:22,300
Wow, they really just kind of put you right back in.

2275
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:22,640
Huh.

2276
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:23,580
Barry was right.

2277
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:25,020
Time was running out.

2278
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:30,180
Everything I saw was a dark, twisted version of reality
based on my memories and thoughts.

2279
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,240
I wonder how easy mode will be.

2280
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:34,920
I'm very curious.

2281
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:36,320
What is this?

2282
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:36,520
Oh.

2283
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:40,220
Turn the pole.

2284
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:40,860
Oh, oh.

2285
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,180
Crumble.

2286
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:44,660
Crumble.

2287
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:46,180
Oh.

2288
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:48,180
Oh.

2289
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:50,880
Um.

2290
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:55,020
It was here.

2291
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:59,060
Is there somewhere I needed to go?

2292
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:00,160
I don't have a flashlight.

2293
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:09,490
Spoiler.

2294
02:18:09,750 --> 02:18:11,170
Easiest, easier than normal.

2295
02:18:11,630 --> 02:18:12,450
No way!

2296
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:17,650
Find a way to bury.

2297
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:26,050
What the heck am I supposed to be doing here?

2298
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:30,610
Do I need to, like, swing...

2299
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:31,790
I think you gotta swing it!

2300
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:34,350
You, I, I, shut up!

2301
02:18:34,430 --> 02:18:36,230
That's exactly what I was about to say!

2302
02:18:36,930 --> 02:18:38,810
That's exactly what I was about to say!

2303
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:44,450
He stole my line!

2304
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:46,190
I was in the...

2305
02:18:46,190 --> 02:18:48,130
I said, I think I need to...

2306
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:50,050
He stole my line!

2307
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:53,810
Backseating Barry over here.

2308
02:18:57,270 --> 02:18:58,150
Goodness gracious.

2309
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:02,110
I'm not gonna have to go through the maze again, am I?

2310
02:19:02,650 --> 02:19:12,630
I had to accept it If all of this was from my mind Then I
was the one making all this happen I was literally fighting

2311
02:19:12,630 --> 02:19:21,390
myself It was a moment of clarity Yes Oh Are they gonna come
from up there

2312
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:34,170
But they have no gun Checkpoint reached Heavy duty lantern
Surprise?

2313
02:19:42,790 --> 02:19:48,910
Is it the ultimate weapon that will destroy everything in
one hit?

2314
02:19:53,130 --> 02:19:55,070
Yeah, too active of an imagination.

2315
02:19:56,170 --> 02:19:57,370
He can't help it, guys.

2316
02:19:57,430 --> 02:19:58,010
He's a writer.

2317
02:19:58,130 --> 02:19:58,750
He's a writer.

2318
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:12,550
Oh, Sorry, visual glitch happened.

2319
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:20,560
Retouch.

2320
02:20:25,230 --> 02:20:27,710
I heard cram bone instead of crumble.

2321
02:20:29,530 --> 02:20:30,770
Why'd you hear that?

2322
02:20:32,170 --> 02:20:33,630
What do you...

2323
02:20:33,630 --> 02:20:35,070
Do I have a gun yet?

2324
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:36,610
No.

2325
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:38,830
Wait, what's...

2326
02:20:38,830 --> 02:20:39,650
What am I climbing?

2327
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:41,890
I guess it happened on the outside?

2328
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:43,470
Oh, here it is, yeah.

2329
02:20:45,930 --> 02:20:47,990
You'll start this mission with no weapons or tools.

2330
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:49,950
Your code name will be naked awake.

2331
02:20:50,210 --> 02:20:50,910
I finished myself.

2332
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:53,770
All I had wanted was to save Alice.

2333
02:20:54,490 --> 02:20:57,290
After that, a part of me had been ready to just give in and
die.

2334
02:20:57,930 --> 02:20:58,890
But I hadn't given up.

2335
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:00,750
Thomas Sane had reached me.

2336
02:21:01,310 --> 02:21:02,630
I had run across a nightmare.

2337
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:03,670
Ready to give in and die.

2338
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:08,290
He kept telling me I was sinking, going too deep.

2339
02:21:08,930 --> 02:21:10,790
I wasn't sure if he meant the dark place or insanity.

2340
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:13,190
Unfortunately for Alan, the person you battled, I have to
get so hard as his ultimate.

2341
02:21:15,130 --> 02:21:15,690
So...

2342
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:16,070
Yeah.

2343
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:30,940
Guys...

2344
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:32,580
I'm...

2345
02:21:32,580 --> 02:21:34,800
Back in the maze!

2346
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:39,850
Pump.

2347
02:21:46,380 --> 02:21:46,800
Oh!

2348
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:48,620
That's what they mean by pump.

2349
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:54,700
Oh, because I think I saw a pump before and I was like, what
the heck does that mean?

2350
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:03,240
I'm hearing strange sounds around me.

2351
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:06,600
Do you guys hear all that?

2352
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:13,240
I'm hearing something like over here.

2353
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:16,680
It's all the guys Viking stuff.

2354
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:22,960
What is this?

2355
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:25,980
Oh, it's the Night Springs video game!

2356
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,080
That's what I was hearing.

2357
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,740
Oh my god.

2358
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:32,400
Pump it.

2359
02:22:33,660 --> 02:22:34,860
Pop it.

2360
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:36,460
Kill it.

2361
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:38,640
Eat it.

2362
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:40,280
Cannibal it.

2363
02:22:41,020 --> 02:22:41,180
Oh!

2364
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:43,280
Nice job, Al!

2365
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:45,840
So, you really are nuts, huh?

2366
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:49,160
Let's face it, we always knew this was coming.

2367
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:49,880
Are there enemies?

2368
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:52,800
I guess, but I actually feel pretty rational.

2369
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,240
All things considered.

2370
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:54,960
Are there enemies?

2371
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,640
Crazy people don't know they're crazy.

2372
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:58,100
That's where they're crazy.

2373
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:00,960
Hey, check out the light show behind the lodge.

2374
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:01,920
Whoa!

2375
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:02,700
That's Zane's light.

2376
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:05,540
Yeah, you're done sinking now.

2377
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,520
That means he's just about caught up with you.

2378
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,260
You better go talk to him.

2379
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:15,390
That's Zane's light.

2380
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:20,590
Cannibalism mentioned.

2381
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:26,440
So many fireworks.

2382
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:30,500
Lots of fireworks here.

2383
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:31,580
Nice.

2384
02:23:31,740 --> 02:23:31,960
Oh.

2385
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:38,460
This guy is so annoying.

2386
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:39,920
Oh.

2387
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:45,400
I'm in a self-deprecating contest with Alan Wake.

2388
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:48,260
Oh, hell yeah.

2389
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:49,520
Remember this, Al?

2390
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,280
The music is so funny.

2391
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:20,300
You guys hear it?

2392
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:21,240
It's so funny.

2393
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:26,660
Wait, I should just do, like, all the fireworks, huh?

2394
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:32,540
They're not stopping, so...

2395
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:37,320
Hey!

2396
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:37,920
Wee!

2397
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:40,780
Why

2398
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:48,260
are these flying around?

2399
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:49,320
They're not possessed.

2400
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:51,280
By

2401
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,440
your own imagination?

2402
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:18,900
It's like your greatest power turned against you.

2403
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:19,720
Very sharp.

2404
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:23,540
That's very deep, but I'm a little busy not dying over here.

2405
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:27,440
Wait, there's only... Can I... Where's the revolver?

2406
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:28,020
Oh, right here.

2407
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:31,020
Surrounded by the enemies and deafened by the noise.

2408
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:31,540
Whoa!

2409
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:32,140
Ouch!

2410
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:36,920
I'm running over here.

2411
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:44,100
I can't imagine this in...

2412
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:47,100
and not...

2413
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:50,100
in like, you know...

2414
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:54,100
normal or other anything else.

2415
02:26:00,350 --> 02:26:01,610
It's over.

2416
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:12,620
Just imagining it like...

2417
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:13,980
You can get inside now, Al.

2418
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:17,300
This guy.

2419
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,280
It's amazing.

2420
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:22,000
I know!

2421
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,980
I love Easy Mode!

2422
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:28,960
Oh, Easy Mode.

2423
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:30,340
Easy Mode, my beloved.

2424
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:35,800
I feel like there's pretty few times that I choose Easy
Mode.

2425
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:37,080
I hope you guys don't mind.

2426
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:42,780
See how?

2427
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:44,600
This is classic you.

2428
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:45,880
Classic V.

2429
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,800
It's so Which is just a memory.

2430
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:51,240
Even your memories are complicated.

2431
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:54,220
Oh, Zane!

2432
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:57,100
Uh, yeah.

2433
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:03,260
So I guess you're gonna need to talk to Zane out there now
that he's actually here.

2434
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:07,680
I'm just gonna, you know, let you non-imaginary people talk
in peace.

2435
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:08,900
Okay, thank you.

2436
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:09,820
You're not coming?

2437
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,880
Nah, that wasn't good much.

2438
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:12,900
Very...

2439
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:14,580
Yeah, you're moving up in the world, buddy.

2440
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:15,800
Oh.

2441
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:16,660
Oh.

2442
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:23,540
Okay, let's go.

2443
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:26,080
Barry, you're not going to come with us?

2444
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:26,460
Same.

2445
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:28,420
You have done well, Alan.

2446
02:27:28,860 --> 02:27:30,140
Now I can accompany you.

2447
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:31,920
You're trapped in your own dream.

2448
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:35,980
You must wake yourself up, but first, you have to reach
yourself.

2449
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:37,720
You have to reach myself.

2450
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:38,400
The cabin!

2451
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:39,900
Yes, my cabin.

2452
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:41,240
It will not be easy.

2453
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:42,540
Your cabin.

2454
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:44,060
Your previous work can help you.

2455
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,660
I still have some pages of your manuscript left.

2456
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,920
Words like that have power here.

2457
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:55,360
So you're going to...

2458
02:27:55,380 --> 02:27:56,680
You're now gonna...

2459
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:58,280
You're gonna accompany us?

2460
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:00,500
With your big massive light?

2461
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:03,740
Who will explain the obvious to us now?

2462
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:09,940
What's he gonna do?

2463
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:11,600
What's he gonna do?

2464
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:14,600
Nothing.

2465
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:16,140
Clear!

2466
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:20,300
I sometimes... I kind of feel like Card Capture Sakura.

2467
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:23,080
You know what I mean?

2468
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:23,620
The lighthouse?

2469
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:25,600
It's very appropriate.

2470
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:27,140
I can help you reach it.

2471
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:30,440
But after that, you will be on your own.

2472
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:32,440
I can only enter the cabin now.

2473
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:35,860
The dark presence made sure of that on our last encounter.

2474
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:40,060
You are facing yourself, the parts of your mind that are
hard to control.

2475
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:43,050
This is not a fight anyone else can win for you.

2476
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:49,550
Guys, let's do rock, paper, scissors.

2477
02:28:50,410 --> 02:28:51,990
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

2478
02:28:55,130 --> 02:28:56,690
I bet you all picked paper.

2479
02:28:57,870 --> 02:28:58,210
Wait.

2480
02:29:00,170 --> 02:29:00,650
Scissor.

2481
02:29:04,590 --> 02:29:05,730
Yeah, you pick scissors.

2482
02:29:07,350 --> 02:29:09,170
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

2483
02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:17,030
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

2484
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:23,460
Rock, paper, scissors, bolt.

2485
02:29:27,230 --> 02:29:28,730
Okay, that's different.

2486
02:29:30,550 --> 02:29:31,790
You thought of it.

2487
02:29:34,410 --> 02:29:37,190
Wait, that's so funny, we have to get rid of the...

2488
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:40,350
Wait, float?

2489
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:42,330
Oh, like a floaty.

2490
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:45,250
I was glad to have Zane waking in this place.

2491
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:47,490
He knew the terrain such as it was.

2492
02:29:48,030 --> 02:29:50,430
But a part of me wondered if he was not a human anymore.

2493
02:29:50,830 --> 02:29:52,170
After so many years in this place.

2494
02:29:53,590 --> 02:29:54,950
I never learned.

2495
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:56,210
Wait.

2496
02:29:58,210 --> 02:30:00,350
It's like destined that one will always fall.

2497
02:30:02,130 --> 02:30:02,750
That's fine.

2498
02:30:05,210 --> 02:30:06,890
Wait, the cabin is literally right here?

2499
02:30:08,470 --> 02:30:10,190
Oh no, we have to reach the lighthouse.

2500
02:30:10,470 --> 02:30:10,750
Just kidding.

2501
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:11,770
Oh.

2502
02:30:12,070 --> 02:30:13,410
The world was tilted.

2503
02:30:13,990 --> 02:30:15,630
It was turning upside down.

2504
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:16,990
Wake was lost.

2505
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:18,050
He would fall.

2506
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:20,950
He couldn't tell which way was up.

2507
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:22,210
He would die there.

2508
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:23,990
Torn apart by the whirlwind.

2509
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:24,830
Uh.

2510
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:25,730
Uh.

2511
02:30:26,390 --> 02:30:27,670
It does say this way.

2512
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:30,730
This way.

2513
02:30:30,810 --> 02:30:32,330
It's giving me arrows.

2514
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:33,750
It's giving me...

2515
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:34,710
There's gamer paint.

2516
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:38,030
Zade, are you familiar with big chungus?

2517
02:30:38,830 --> 02:30:44,430
What if, what if Alan Wake used his powers for good, like
fan fiction and stuff, you know?

2518
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:51,480
The wind was picking up.

2519
02:30:51,900 --> 02:30:53,300
Wake was too high.

2520
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:54,680
Too high.

2521
02:30:55,180 --> 02:30:58,020
At this height, the water would be like hitting concrete.

2522
02:30:58,220 --> 02:30:59,040
Too high.

2523
02:30:59,560 --> 02:31:01,520
Oh, woo, it's crazy.

2524
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:03,360
Oh, Jesus.

2525
02:31:04,120 --> 02:31:05,400
You can't want me dead this bad.

2526
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:06,760
The storm was coming.

2527
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:08,820
It would throw him off.

2528
02:31:11,460 --> 02:31:11,760
Bridge!

2529
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:33,760
Oh, uh, wait, wait, wait.

2530
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,040
Can I make, I can make this.

2531
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:37,940
Huh?

2532
02:31:38,900 --> 02:31:39,540
Nice.

2533
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:41,600
Ah!

2534
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:42,680
Holy cow!

2535
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:45,220
You're no milker.

2536
02:31:58,930 --> 02:32:01,410
Where is that big boy hiding?

2537
02:32:02,430 --> 02:32:04,330
The storm spun him around.

2538
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:06,150
It was made of darkness.

2539
02:32:06,470 --> 02:32:07,810
He'd seen what it could do.

2540
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:09,130
It swept everything.

2541
02:32:09,150 --> 02:32:13,570
I would have to make my way through the swirling waves.

2542
02:32:14,130 --> 02:32:15,790
It reminded me of the dark presence.

2543
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:17,050
Oh, just a revolver.

2544
02:32:17,390 --> 02:32:18,950
But it could still kill me.

2545
02:32:20,390 --> 02:32:21,710
It could still kill you.

2546
02:32:21,970 --> 02:32:23,770
If you die in the game, you die in real life.

2547
02:32:25,230 --> 02:32:25,450
Wait!

2548
02:32:25,570 --> 02:32:26,550
Oh my gosh, the bed!

2549
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:27,870
The bed?

2550
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:28,410
Okay.

2551
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:32,970
Oh, my eyes.

2552
02:32:38,210 --> 02:32:39,050
Alan clap.

2553
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:43,780
The game is real.

2554
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:52,840
phase yeah he's not see all you have to do is not listen to
the annoying guy on the tv just do what you want imagine

2555
02:32:52,840 --> 02:33:00,640
this with voice controls if this could be a fun like they it
would be pretty fun to have like an alan wake typing of the

2556
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:06,620
dead kind of type thing you know oh i

2557
02:33:14,900 --> 02:33:26,060
think this level maybe didn't need easy mode you know what i
mean Well, I don't know how it would have been.

2558
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:27,440
They focused on the lighthouse.

2559
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:31,140
If you can reach it, you will find the cabin.

2560
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:32,980
It could have been really bad.

2561
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:33,540
Who knows?

2562
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:35,480
It's to be expected.

2563
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:38,080
You're struggling to reclaim yourself.

2564
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:40,960
The landscape reflects that strain.

2565
02:33:41,380 --> 02:33:42,960
But each step takes you closer.

2566
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:44,340
Scribble thoughts.

2567
02:33:44,420 --> 02:33:47,660
The thing that came to the city that fends out the darkness.

2568
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:48,160
Yeah.

2569
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:52,120
Is there anything else?

2570
02:33:54,220 --> 02:34:09,790
revolver ammo okay reach the lighthouse at least we're not
really in the woods anymore now that i knew what i was

2571
02:34:09,790 --> 02:34:16,910
facing the environment became even wilder and stranger oh no
like it was no longer even bothering to pretend that things

2572
02:34:16,910 --> 02:34:25,150
were normal are you saying you're regretting switching to
easy no i'm just saying that i think the other chapter was

2573
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:28,830
or the other chapter previous like from what I had done.

2574
02:34:29,070 --> 02:34:33,330
You know, I haven't, I'm not very far in this one, but it
seemed more intensive than...

2575
02:34:33,330 --> 02:34:33,890
What's a roll?

2576
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:35,110
I just ate one of those.

2577
02:34:35,370 --> 02:34:37,050
I grabbed a roll when I got some water.

2578
02:34:38,850 --> 02:34:39,250
Oh.

2579
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:42,870
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2580
02:35:03,580 --> 02:35:04,940
Overload, let's, let's roll.

2581
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:07,540
Oh, shoot.

2582
02:35:10,060 --> 02:35:11,120
Oh my god.

2583
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:15,700
I would like to use the roll!

2584
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:19,340
I would like to use the roll, please.

2585
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:25,620
I'm just bad at it.

2586
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:30,320
Just whispered that.

2587
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:34,420
Kind of cool you can hear the liquid inside them.

2588
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:35,300
I know, right?

2589
02:35:36,180 --> 02:35:37,760
I would like to use it.

2590
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:40,280
I'm just not good at timing it.

2591
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:42,680
There's so many of them.

2592
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:45,200
Oh my god.

2593
02:35:50,780 --> 02:35:51,320
Oh.

2594
02:35:52,580 --> 02:35:53,620
Oh, there it is.

2595
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:55,120
There they are.

2596
02:36:02,750 --> 02:36:03,970
There's one guy left.

2597
02:36:05,110 --> 02:36:07,850
Oh, uh, I think, uh, oh, here we go.

2598
02:36:11,170 --> 02:36:11,570
Not me!

2599
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:12,090
Ouch!

2600
02:36:13,010 --> 02:36:14,450
That guy!

2601
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:17,410
Oh,

2602
02:36:20,660 --> 02:36:21,780
like it targeted me.

2603
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:29,100
Um, oh, there's More guys.

2604
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:30,600
Oh shoot.

2605
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:40,760
Dude.

2606
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:44,340
Big boy!

2607
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:44,880
Big boy!

2608
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:45,340
You coming!

2609
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:53,340
Now they're only sending like one big guy in and rather than
like, rather than like 15 of them at once.

2610
02:36:55,580 --> 02:36:55,740
Okay.

2611
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:56,920
Okay.

2612
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:00,000
That was intense.

2613
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:05,520
SpongeBob pants.

2614
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:05,920
Okay.

2615
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:07,260
Yeah.

2616
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:09,380
SpongeBob.

2617
02:37:09,380 --> 02:37:10,180
Big Pat.

2618
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:11,080
Spend the boat.

2619
02:37:11,380 --> 02:37:12,060
Man, it's okay.

2620
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:20,220
Let's keep going.

2621
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:23,080
Maybe it's 15 and normal.

2622
02:37:23,220 --> 02:37:24,320
It probably would have been.

2623
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:26,620
I probably would have been like...

2624
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:29,420
I'm cruising right now.

2625
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:30,780
Hole.

2626
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:32,080
Oh, oh, oh, no.

2627
02:37:37,430 --> 02:37:38,690
Why did that happen?

2628
02:37:39,310 --> 02:37:40,270
Can I go in?

2629
02:37:41,710 --> 02:37:42,230
Oh.

2630
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:46,540
Oh, I can't.

2631
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:46,820
Okay.

2632
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:51,380
Oh, I should reload.

2633
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:52,740
Okay, there we go.

2634
02:37:58,220 --> 02:37:59,340
There's a hole here.

2635
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:00,420
It's gone now.

2636
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:01,240
Ouch!

2637
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:03,320
These stank and words, man.

2638
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:05,180
Can I crank it?

2639
02:38:05,300 --> 02:38:06,160
Can I get it back up?

2640
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:20,680
I'm not supposed to go up here, right?

2641
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:25,580
Hello?

2642
02:38:27,460 --> 02:38:28,940
I guess we'll do the fireworks.

2643
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:30,040
See what happens.

2644
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:31,240
Oh!

2645
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:34,060
Oh, it's funky.

2646
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:36,440
Whoa!

2647
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:42,040
Unlimited flares?

2648
02:38:51,180 --> 02:38:51,440
Ah!

2649
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:51,920
Oh!

2650
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:52,580
Oh!

2651
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:54,660
Wow!

2652
02:38:57,460 --> 02:38:58,440
Still unlimited?

2653
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:04,040
Amazing.

2654
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:06,340
Hmm.

2655
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:10,140
Uh-huh.

2656
02:39:14,300 --> 02:39:15,020
The cart.

2657
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:17,560
The random shopping cart.

2658
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:29,920
Oh, puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose
again.

2659
02:39:32,060 --> 02:39:37,580
Oh, puts the flare on the hole or else it gets the flare
again.

2660
02:39:38,380 --> 02:39:39,820
I reached the checkpoint.

2661
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:43,740
Is this the well-lit room area?

2662
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:45,420
Or this is the tunnel to the well.

2663
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,560
I can't see anything.

2664
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:48,080
Oh, I'm supposed to go over here.

2665
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:54,160
That doesn't sound like a good sound.

2666
02:39:55,240 --> 02:39:56,700
Sound like a pretty bad sound.

2667
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:57,740
Oh, geez.

2668
02:39:58,140 --> 02:39:59,680
He came up on me first.

2669
02:40:07,690 --> 02:40:08,510
Pretty cool.

2670
02:40:12,710 --> 02:40:14,010
Am I lost in here?

2671
02:40:14,210 --> 02:40:15,090
Oh, golly.

2672
02:40:16,710 --> 02:40:17,570
Oh, it's you!

2673
02:40:18,710 --> 02:40:19,150
Oh!

2674
02:40:22,740 --> 02:40:25,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2675
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:36,100
Look, it's so noisy.

2676
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:37,160
Ah!

2677
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:43,880
Anyway.

2678
02:40:45,460 --> 02:40:45,660
Huh.

2679
02:40:50,830 --> 02:40:52,230
That's the well-lit tunnel.

2680
02:40:53,090 --> 02:40:54,270
To the well-lit room.

2681
02:40:55,970 --> 02:40:56,510
The...

2682
02:40:56,510 --> 02:40:56,850
The...

2683
02:40:56,850 --> 02:41:01,110
Quake was forced to run through a maze, hopelessly sprinting
in the wheel.

2684
02:41:01,490 --> 02:41:02,430
Never getting anywhere.

2685
02:41:02,850 --> 02:41:04,230
His life in miniature.

2686
02:41:04,650 --> 02:41:05,550
It was useless.

2687
02:41:08,030 --> 02:41:08,750
Oh

2688
02:41:11,950 --> 02:41:13,870
Not a maze.

2689
02:41:15,010 --> 02:41:16,610
Oh, it is a wheel.

2690
02:41:17,410 --> 02:41:21,970
Oh my gosh It's a wheel

2691
02:41:28,550 --> 02:41:33,770

Wait.

2694
02:41:40,990 --> 02:41:42,890
Wait, it's getting low again.

2695
02:41:45,910 --> 02:41:48,490
We just give it enough time?

2696
02:41:49,890 --> 02:41:50,610
Hamptor.

2697
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:52,590

Oh, they're giant!

2700
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:03,040
Into the water?

2701
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:05,220
Oof.

2702
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:07,420

This part's really cool.

2709

I gotta wait for them to roll.

And then we follow.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

How am I supposed to avoid this?

2720

Okay.

2721
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:51,740

Oh, I think I'll go through here?

2727
02:44:06,820 --> 02:44:07,880
It's so trippy.

2728
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:08,720
It is!

2729
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:12,020

2736
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:21,880

sense.

2737
02:45:26,420 --> 02:45:27,380
I'm impatient.

2738
02:45:28,060 --> 02:45:29,840
I'm ready to go to the next row.

2739
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:33,680
Alan, wait.

2740
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:36,900
Ugh, fine.

2741
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:37,860
Alan, wait.

2742
02:45:38,220 --> 02:45:38,780
Alan, wait.

2743
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:42,740
It's like hard.

2744
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:43,500
I can't tell.

2745
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:44,820
Oh, shoot.

2746
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:45,720
Oh, wait.

2747
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:46,320
There we go.

2748
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:47,060
Okay, nice.

2749
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:52,640
Alan wait, Alan patient.

2750
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:53,980
Alan be patient.

2751
02:45:57,320 --> 02:46:00,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, I slipped!

2752
02:46:03,700 --> 02:46:04,120
Alan?

2753
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:07,560
Alan, don't slip off the edge, buddy.

2754
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:10,260
Like, what are you doing here?

2755
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:13,520
Oh.

2756
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:16,240
I thought that was, I thought you would...

2757
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:17,060
Just hold on.

2758
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:23,640
Alan slip and slide, Alan stumble.

2759
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:31,400
If I stand against the wall, it should be okay.

2760
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:31,860
Alright.

2761
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:36,820
We're gonna be lying down a little bit.

2762
02:46:38,900 --> 02:46:41,820
Okay, we're really short.

2763
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:46,080
Okay, here we go.

2764
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:56,110
Um...

2765
02:46:56,110 --> 02:46:56,770
Do I open this?

2766
02:46:57,010 --> 02:46:57,350
No.

2767
02:46:57,970 --> 02:46:58,530
Oh!

2768
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:03,290
It opens itself!

2769
02:47:04,530 --> 02:47:06,230
The Wellit Room!

2770
02:47:15,580 --> 02:47:16,760
Is that gonna stop this ride?

2771
02:47:17,460 --> 02:47:18,060
An elevator?

2772
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:19,380
Sure, why not?

2773
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:20,560
Sure, why not?

2774
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:22,900
Next stop is sanity.

2775
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:24,560
You're doing well.

2776
02:47:24,700 --> 02:47:25,240
Keep going.

2777
02:47:25,660 --> 02:47:26,380
Thank you!

2778
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:27,000
I like saying.

2779
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:29,700
It's a dream.

2780
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:31,920
This is a vast place.

2781
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:35,220
Home to forces and beings that are completely alien.

2782
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:38,440
The dark presence yes.

2783
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,080
I don't know what happened to it after your final encounter
Is there any way out of here?

2784
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:47,600
Sometimes transmissions can be sent between worlds.

2785
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:51,860
You've done this yourself But to actually leave the dark
place.

2786
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:53,680
I haven't found a way.

2787
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:55,360
Yeah, I think what did you think?

2788
02:47:55,580 --> 02:47:57,800
What did you expect him to have done it if he knew?

2789
02:47:59,780 --> 02:48:01,080
We'll get you out of here Zane

2790
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:06,640
Stucky's gas station Oh my gosh!

2791
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:11,320
Not something I particularly wanted to see, but obviously I
wasn't the one in the driver's seat.

2792
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:14,120
Stucky's gas station!

2793
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:15,600
It's been so long!

2794
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:16,920
Wait.

2795
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:18,480
We have 13?

2796
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:21,000
Hello.

2797
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:21,860
Reload.

2798
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:27,220
Another memory made real.

2799
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:27,860
The other memory made real.

2800
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:28,800
Wake would never make it.

2801
02:48:29,140 --> 02:48:32,160
The insanity he was facing was already a part of the- Never
think of Shaka.

2802
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:33,600
His own doing.

2803
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:35,300
He couldn't possibly win.

2804
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:35,660
Oh nice.

2805
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:36,840
He didn't even want to!

2806
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:38,900
What?

2807
02:48:39,960 --> 02:48:40,660
I want to win.

2808
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:44,500
This is the first place we were on.

2809
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:45,980
Nordic walking.

2810
02:48:48,980 --> 02:48:49,460
Welcome.

2811
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:51,460
Yeah.

2812
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,480
We'll go with the...

2813
02:48:54,480 --> 02:48:55,880
I feel like...

2814
02:48:55,880 --> 02:49:00,920
I kind of want the shotgun just because we have so much ammo
for it, but at the same time...

2815
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:01,260
Hello?

2816
02:49:05,720 --> 02:49:06,820
At least the...

2817
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:32,510
lighthouse was much closer now i would have to make my way
up there somehow boom boom boom you make my heart go oh my

2818
02:49:32,510 --> 02:49:54,800
god oh my god there were so few guys i love easy mode there
was just three guys So, oh, that's not anything.

2819
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:56,100
That was so awesome.

2820
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:01,520
Oh.

2821
02:50:02,980 --> 02:50:04,820
Wait, the deer now, do you guys see that?

2822
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,260
The deer is now two-headed.

2823
02:50:07,780 --> 02:50:08,240
Oh, wait.

2824
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:09,900
I think it's two deer.

2825
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:14,540
Oh, there's a deer up there!

2826
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:15,600
Ew.

2827
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:20,380
I like the visual storytelling here.

2828
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:22,900
Like, everything's kind of gone crazy and weird.

2829
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:26,600
You know, it's fun to see.

2830
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:29,020
Oh, dear!

2831
02:50:31,320 --> 02:50:31,960
Boom.

2832
02:50:35,810 --> 02:50:39,370
Go back to my revolver and save the ammo for that.

2833
02:50:40,250 --> 02:50:41,650
Wire, wire, wire.

2834
02:50:42,130 --> 02:50:44,770
Wire, wire, pants on fire.

2835
02:50:53,330 --> 02:50:54,410
What does that do?

2836
02:50:55,010 --> 02:50:55,710
Oh, there's a button.

2837
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:00,460
Okay.

2838
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:02,960
There was no power to the log lift.

2839
02:51:04,420 --> 02:51:04,940
Loglift.

2840
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:05,880
Wire.

2841
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:08,600
Jaguar.

2842
02:51:17,930 --> 02:51:18,270
Oops.

2843
02:51:18,850 --> 02:51:19,670
Oh, oh, whoa.

2844
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:31,240
Oh, my gosh.

2845
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:32,300
Stop it.

2846
02:51:36,830 --> 02:51:37,910
Where the other guy go?

2847
02:51:39,470 --> 02:51:40,370
Oh, there was one more.

2848
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:42,410
Oh, well, there's a guy down here.

2849
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:45,310
Oh, there's a guy down here.

2850
02:51:45,310 --> 02:51:46,010
Who did I just avoid?

2851
02:51:46,550 --> 02:51:48,130
Oh, just you?

2852
02:51:49,310 --> 02:51:49,830
Oh.

2853
02:51:51,330 --> 02:51:51,850
Oh.

2854
02:51:52,750 --> 02:51:53,570
Does this deal?

2855
02:51:54,130 --> 02:51:55,030
Uh, let's get the wire.

2856
02:51:57,450 --> 02:51:57,730
Eh.

2857
02:52:00,030 --> 02:52:01,030
Maybe that's it.

2858
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:01,590
Oh, wire?

2859
02:52:06,490 --> 02:52:06,810
Start.

2860
02:52:08,530 --> 02:52:13,750
Eee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee.

2861
02:52:13,770 --> 02:52:16,190
Eee-ee-ee-ee.

2862
02:52:16,190 --> 02:52:17,970
You dodged the word damage.

2863
02:52:18,910 --> 02:52:20,230
Is that what it was?

2864
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:25,770
Huge if real.

2865
02:52:29,970 --> 02:52:31,410
That's so funny

2866
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:48,620
Alan run Alan use Great stream, Vito I'm having a lot more
fun So I'm glad

2867
02:52:51,980 --> 02:53:03,640
Before I was like Man, this is a tough play But now I'm
enjoying myself Okay Before I was just stressed.

2868
02:53:04,260 --> 02:53:05,940
Now I'm like...

2869
02:53:05,940 --> 02:53:09,300
I honestly think there's nothing wrong with like...

2870
02:53:09,300 --> 02:53:10,440
Yeah, uh...

2871
02:53:10,440 --> 02:53:12,040
I think it was Alan Wake.

2872
02:53:12,980 --> 02:53:16,200
There was something that had like a...

2873
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:20,400
An easy mode just so you could enjoy the story.

2874
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:22,420
It might have been Alan Wake.

2875
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:25,400
Can't remember.

2876
02:53:28,140 --> 02:53:29,860
There was definitely something there.

2877
02:53:33,440 --> 02:53:33,920
Soma?

2878
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:35,440
No, I haven't played Soma yet.

2879
02:53:36,580 --> 02:53:38,100
One day I probably will.

2880
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:39,920
Expedition 33 did.

2881
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:42,480
Yeah, I don't necessarily see any harm in that.

2882
02:53:42,700 --> 02:53:47,000
The part of you that is in control is in the cabin, dreaming
and insane.

2883
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:47,860
To me.

2884
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:49,560
I don't think I like that.

2885
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:51,320
I'm dreaming and insane.

2886
02:53:51,400 --> 02:53:57,080
You represent the part of Alan Wake that is capable of
rational thought and planning, which is why I'm talking to

2887
02:53:57,080 --> 02:53:57,400
you.

2888
02:53:57,960 --> 02:54:01,420
If that part can regain control, then you have a chance of
making it.

2889
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:11,140
to give in there's comfort in the oblivion of dreams you
represent the part that isn't ready to quit and die yeah

2890
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:18,100
wait are you telling me i'm not real you're as real as
anything else in this place well that's a buzz in my hand so

say that when you wrote that page about me and the clicker?

2893
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:37,520
Yeah, it wasn't one of my pages.

2894
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:38,620
You directed me to it.

2895
02:54:38,700 --> 02:54:50,140
You had Weaver guard it Yes, she was needed and you needed
the clicker, but I am not What I don't understand you should

2896
02:54:50,140 --> 02:54:57,700

us

2897
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:07,320
Interesting Oh my gosh, it's like a...

2898
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:08,260
It's like a target.

2899
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:18,080
Something Zane's being a little sketchy about.

2900
02:55:20,340 --> 02:55:21,380
No, the batteries.

2901
02:55:22,140 --> 02:55:22,240
Oh.

2902
02:55:23,700 --> 02:55:24,100
Okay.

2903
02:55:27,180 --> 02:55:29,840
Why does this keep rolling all on its own?

2904
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:33,600
Why does it keep... Why is it doing that?

2905
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:35,740
Where is it got it?

2906
02:55:35,800 --> 02:55:36,660
Why is it getting all this?

2907
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:41,800
This gives itself momentum to roll some more.

2908
02:55:44,040 --> 02:55:46,460
It's like, nah, nope.

2909
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:52,620
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.

2910
02:55:53,240 --> 02:55:55,880
Keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.

2911
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:01,620
Perpetual motion.

2912
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:02,680
Yes.

2913
02:56:26,610 --> 02:56:27,490
Keep on... Whoa!

2914
02:56:28,050 --> 02:56:28,790
The ship!

2915
02:56:29,270 --> 02:56:29,470
What?

2916
02:56:29,650 --> 02:56:30,470
Wait, where are we?

2917
02:56:30,470 --> 02:56:34,030
Are we like... Oh, we're like floating in space or
something?

2918
02:56:34,230 --> 02:56:34,570
Not space.

2919
02:56:34,710 --> 02:56:35,090
The sky?

2920
02:56:35,970 --> 02:56:37,010
Something's going on.

2921
02:56:37,410 --> 02:56:38,030
It's pretty freaky.

2922
02:56:38,630 --> 02:56:39,190
Oh, boom!

2923
02:56:45,900 --> 02:56:47,380
I wouldn't say I'm gaming.

2924
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:48,320
I'm on easy mode.

2925
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:50,440
But yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong.

2926
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:52,640
Some people like just want to experience a story.

2927
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:56,140
They don't want to necessarily be a pro gamer about it
something.

2928
02:56:57,340 --> 02:57:03,480
And as long as there's harder options for people that do
want the challenge i don't see any issue with it you know

2929
02:57:03,480 --> 02:57:17,400
the bridge roads in the unnatural wind it was heralding the
enemy's arrival wait wouldn't leave this place alive uh is

2930
02:57:17,400 --> 02:57:26,900
this the gun yeah what's gonna happen here boom

2931
02:57:33,890 --> 02:57:34,570
Boom.

2932
02:57:38,010 --> 02:57:38,750
Oh, boom.

2933
02:57:43,260 --> 02:57:44,420
Oh, shoot!

2934
02:57:45,300 --> 02:57:46,620
That's what that means.

2935
02:57:47,540 --> 02:57:50,940
I thought like the ground might fall underneath them or
something.

2936
02:57:51,900 --> 02:57:53,280
Like the ground would crumble.

2937
02:57:54,380 --> 02:57:57,360
Not that they would get crumbled.

2938
02:57:58,540 --> 02:57:58,700
Oh,

2939
02:58:01,780 --> 02:58:02,360
it does!

2940
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:03,560
Never mind.

2941
02:58:04,260 --> 02:58:04,660
Oh, shoot.

2942
02:58:05,300 --> 02:58:06,500
Oh, whoop, whoop.

2943
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:09,360
Got a flare.

2944
02:58:15,790 --> 02:58:16,150
Whoa!

2945
02:58:16,490 --> 02:58:17,670
You're close to me.

2946
02:58:23,300 --> 02:58:23,480
Whoa!

2947
02:58:37,590 --> 02:58:42,350
I wish I could use the boom, but you guys came at me so
close.

2948
02:58:45,490 --> 02:58:49,590
I was like all the way already here when you guys started
coming after me.

2949
02:58:51,150 --> 02:58:52,450
Nice dodge, thank you.

2950
02:58:55,930 --> 02:58:58,070
I wonder what easy mode makes easier.

2951
02:58:58,210 --> 02:58:58,750
You know what I mean?

2952
02:58:58,890 --> 02:58:59,410
Like, is it...

2953
02:59:00,410 --> 02:59:01,610
Like, does it make dodge?

2954
02:59:01,910 --> 02:59:02,910
I can help you here.

2955
02:59:03,090 --> 02:59:04,190
Moments easier as well.

2956
02:59:04,390 --> 02:59:05,670
Oh, you can help me here?

2957
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:12,660
Is Zane all powerful?

2958
02:59:16,580 --> 02:59:19,680
I like a challenge, but I generally like games for
experience me.

2959
02:59:20,680 --> 02:59:22,180
Like, I do a no death run.

2960
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:23,880
But I want to experience the game as I do it.

2961
02:59:24,700 --> 02:59:25,720
There's a connection.

2962
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:29,480
Yeah, I get it.

2963
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:31,760
Just the number of enemies.

2964
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:33,960
You fixed the foolish mistake I made with Barbara.

2965
02:59:36,560 --> 02:59:42,420
I like the way Alan Wake looks when he's going down, like on
the...

2966
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:44,860
on the... when he's like, he's trying to be so careful.

2967
02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:47,280
He's like, ooh, gotta be careful.

2968
02:59:47,720 --> 02:59:48,520
Watch my step.

2969
02:59:48,920 --> 02:59:50,200
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

2970
02:59:51,980 --> 02:59:53,180
He looks so goofy.

2971
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:56,260
Rock!

2972
02:59:58,080 --> 03:00:00,140
Nothing beats good old rock.

2973
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:05,700
Oh, don't fall.

2974
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:09,800
They just don't fall.

2975
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:16,300
It also appears they spawn even more from the tools word.

2976
03:00:17,820 --> 03:00:18,640
Oh, the enemies?

2977
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:20,760
Or there's more tools?

2978
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:21,960
Oh!

2979
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:25,040
Oh!

2980
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:32,180
Nothing beats rock.

2981
03:00:35,780 --> 03:00:38,120
I threw that from all the way over there.

2982
03:00:38,480 --> 03:00:39,180
Holy cow.

2983
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:51,440
Stop it.

2984
03:00:51,500 --> 03:00:52,100
Leave me...

2985
03:00:52,100 --> 03:00:52,400
Ouch.

2986
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:03,220
That would be so embarrassing.

2987
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:05,460
Leave me alone.

2988
03:01:05,620 --> 03:01:06,680
I'm trying to dodge.

2989
03:01:13,350 --> 03:01:13,950
Gosh.

2990
03:01:16,810 --> 03:01:20,750
Should I use this for those guys?

2991
03:01:26,370 --> 03:01:26,770
Flash?

2992
03:01:34,430 --> 03:01:35,210
What's happening?

2993
03:01:36,210 --> 03:01:36,430
Whoa.

2994
03:01:40,010 --> 03:01:42,970
Planning on playing through MGS for myself soon, but stealth
games are not my thing.

2995
03:01:43,010 --> 03:01:44,110
Good thing there's an easy mode.

2996
03:01:47,010 --> 03:01:47,350
Is there?

2997
03:01:48,010 --> 03:01:48,750
I can't remember.

2998
03:01:50,630 --> 03:01:52,210
There is for some of the games, though, for sure.

2999
03:01:58,450 --> 03:02:01,150
For some of the games, oh my gosh.

3000
03:02:07,640 --> 03:02:08,360
By birds!

3001
03:02:19,690 --> 03:02:22,710
I got my butt beat by the birds.

3002
03:02:25,310 --> 03:02:27,210
Can I get this guy?

3003
03:02:28,330 --> 03:02:29,150
Not from here.

3004
03:02:30,450 --> 03:02:31,650
Stinking birds.

3005
03:02:48,770 --> 03:02:52,050
Doodle-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

3006
03:02:53,890 --> 03:02:54,450
Not

3007
03:03:03,210 --> 03:03:04,030
just birds!

3008
03:03:23,400 --> 03:03:24,520
Don't move!

3009
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:29,060
Everything's fine.

3010
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:30,400
Maybe.

3011
03:03:35,090 --> 03:03:38,790
I'm just thinking how glad I am on YouTube mode right now.

3012
03:03:41,720 --> 03:03:42,980
How in Stormtrooper M.

3013
03:03:43,640 --> 03:03:44,380
M, don't go.

3014
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:45,560
Sorry.

3015
03:03:46,780 --> 03:03:48,920
I forgot I was playing a game.

3016
03:03:51,700 --> 03:03:53,240
I forgot I was the one...

3017
03:03:53,240 --> 03:03:59,640
I just reached the checkpoint and then I reached another
checkpoint i forgot i'm the one controlling him wake ran for

3018
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:06,160
the light it was pointless he would never reach it his life
would be snuffed out just as easily as the very thing you

3019
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:14,760
would save him you jerk with the light gone all i could do
was keep going i mean you got rid of the light but it's

3020
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:20,280
still a lighthouse i just reached another checkpoint adys's
version of easy mode is pretty neat it has a toggle that

3021
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:26,680
makes it so every time you die your character gets buffed up
to a certain Hoi!

3022
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:36,160
I'm glad we hit the checkpoint.

3023
03:04:42,010 --> 03:04:42,770
My bad.

3024
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:49,700
Careful?

3025
03:04:50,300 --> 03:04:51,200
Easy now?

3026
03:04:52,420 --> 03:04:53,220
Easy?

3027
03:04:59,720 --> 03:04:59,940
Alan.

3028
03:05:02,480 --> 03:05:02,800
Whoops.

3029
03:05:03,300 --> 03:05:03,480
Alan.

3030
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:04,140
Alan Butterfingers.

3031
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:05,940
Alan Butterfeet.

3032
03:05:07,340 --> 03:05:08,600
Clumsy Alan.

3033
03:05:08,820 --> 03:05:09,840
That's what everybody calls him.

3034
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:18,680
around the bush you have a lot of problems alan alan with a
lot of problems i'm so glad you decided to come back to me

3035
03:05:18,680 --> 03:05:30,700
oh wait okay oh since we're being so frank here alan and let
me just reiterate how happy i am that you've had this break

3036
03:05:30,700 --> 03:05:39,340
i would like to summarize your condition by all means and
please just let me know if you think i'm being unfair all

3037
03:05:39,340 --> 03:05:48,260
right i could just leave start with the obvious the car
crash untreated head trauma all due respect to Doc Nelson

3038
03:05:48,260 --> 03:05:56,140
but he's hardly a neurosurgeon I think that the injury has
affected you more than you realize yeah I have had bad

3039
03:05:56,140 --> 03:06:02,720
headaches then there's your history of substance abuse which
combined with your chronic insomnia has resulted in

3040
03:06:02,720 --> 03:06:10,300
hallucinations and extremely poor impulse control that's a
dangerous combination one which your wife has unfortunately

3041
03:06:10,300 --> 03:06:18,900
had to suffer from far more than you i know i know she
hasn't i don't think i'm exaggerating when i say that you

3042
03:06:18,900 --> 03:06:27,780
are existing in a state of all encompassing denial can i be
in the in the kitchen oh there i am and allows you to skirt

3043
03:06:27,780 --> 03:06:33,600
responsibility for your own actions oh i'm too in the door
your imaginary problems and dismiss

3044
03:06:37,080 --> 03:06:46,240
illusions your personal problems are assets that allow you
to save Alice perhaps even the world dr. Harmon I I think

3045
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:53,540
that's spot-on I can't argue with any of that well I'm sure
I'm saying the obvious I don't want to labor the point but

3046
03:06:53,540 --> 03:07:03,300
well um no no I understand it's important that I face it
precisely Alan you've put so much effort and imagination

3047
03:07:03,300 --> 03:07:05,220
into this self-deception the point

3048
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:14,260
I'm sick of hearing of your silliness.

3049
03:07:15,240 --> 03:07:17,280
This was just another attempt to confuse me.

3050
03:07:17,820 --> 03:07:20,560
By now I knew these phantoms and figments for what they
were.

3051
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:24,240
Echoes of the pain, guilt and hopelessness, a part of me
wallowed in.

3052
03:07:24,440 --> 03:07:25,960
What I heard in there wasn't the truth.

3053
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:28,060
It was just another toxic mirage.

3054
03:07:28,440 --> 03:07:32,580
It cut deep, but that made me all the more determined to
force myself to snap out of it.

3055
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:34,460
I didn't want to be that guy anymore.

3056
03:07:34,600 --> 03:07:36,620
I had to make myself see the light.

3057
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:39,080
They were like tools and stuff though.

3058
03:07:39,800 --> 03:07:43,540
One second.

3059
03:07:46,700 --> 03:07:47,840
Getting tired, sorry.

3060
03:07:49,100 --> 03:07:49,520
Oh no.

3061
03:07:51,080 --> 03:07:51,860
Oh, okay.

3062
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:55,240
Oh, but my tools!

3063
03:07:56,460 --> 03:07:56,640
No!

3064
03:07:59,200 --> 03:07:59,560
Okay.

3065
03:08:03,440 --> 03:08:04,380
Alan Gambari!

3066
03:08:05,360 --> 03:08:06,560
Yeah, I made him tired.

3067
03:08:08,240 --> 03:08:10,760
He won't Alan wake again if he's too tired.

3068
03:08:10,780 --> 03:08:12,780
He's got Alan's sleep.

3069
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:18,840
Paying my weekly veto tax, Quinn!

3070
03:08:19,160 --> 03:08:19,340
Thank you!

3071
03:08:19,480 --> 03:08:21,620
I hope you had a great day and enjoy the rest of the game.

3072
03:08:21,880 --> 03:08:22,840
Thank you so much!

3073
03:08:27,330 --> 03:08:31,830
Is there something I missed?

3074
03:08:41,580 --> 03:08:43,720
Oh, there's gotta be another one around.

3075
03:08:45,680 --> 03:08:46,200
Probably.

3076
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:47,360
Down below.

3077
03:08:50,640 --> 03:08:51,160
Uh...

3078
03:08:51,720 --> 03:08:52,240
Uh...

3079
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:52,860
Go, go, go.

3080
03:08:55,060 --> 03:08:55,320
Oh.

3081
03:08:55,920 --> 03:08:56,640
Come on.

3082
03:08:57,280 --> 03:08:58,420
Come on, Alan.

3083
03:08:59,940 --> 03:09:00,860
Oh, there it is.

3084
03:09:00,900 --> 03:09:01,540
There's the tools.

3085
03:09:05,220 --> 03:09:05,740
Ouch!

3086
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:07,580
Oh my god, don't get too close!

3087
03:09:08,800 --> 03:09:09,720
No, no, no!

3088
03:09:13,620 --> 03:09:14,880
Oh my god.

3089
03:09:15,180 --> 03:09:16,980
What a terrible...

3090
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:20,080
What an actual terrible feature.

3091
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:25,960
Like...

3092
03:09:25,960 --> 03:09:28,540
It's actually so messed up!

3093
03:09:30,120 --> 03:09:31,720
That they...

3094
03:09:36,250 --> 03:09:37,250
Allow...

3095
03:09:37,250 --> 03:09:40,750
Some game dev is laughing in sadistic glee.

3096
03:09:41,090 --> 03:09:43,050
Actually though...

3097
03:09:44,890 --> 03:09:45,690
Oh,

3098
03:10:06,740 --> 03:10:07,560
it's in here.

3099
03:10:09,560 --> 03:10:10,280
Is that the game?

3100
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:12,740
Night Springs video game.

3101
03:10:16,400 --> 03:10:17,460
No, no, no, no.

3102
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:24,280
Messed up.

3103
03:10:25,640 --> 03:10:26,080
Messed up.

3104
03:10:26,240 --> 03:10:27,180
Messed up.

3105
03:10:35,550 --> 03:10:38,270
Yeah, we're always going back to the woods now, aren't we?

3106
03:10:39,230 --> 03:10:40,750
Isn't that just so exciting?

3107
03:10:40,910 --> 03:10:41,730
Back in the woods.

3108
03:10:45,890 --> 03:10:46,770
Wait, where?

3109
03:10:46,950 --> 03:10:47,530
Oh, up there.

3110
03:10:50,170 --> 03:11:12,870
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

3111
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:17,400
Is there anything else up here?

3112
03:11:18,320 --> 03:11:19,360
I feel like there should be, no?

3113
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:22,020
Am I exploring for the sake of nothing?

3114
03:11:23,820 --> 03:11:24,260
Probably.

3115
03:11:26,580 --> 03:11:27,020
Ah!

3116
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:37,160
Well done.

3117
03:11:37,540 --> 03:11:38,100
Thank you!

3118
03:11:38,220 --> 03:11:41,200
You have come far, but there's still a little further to go.

3119
03:11:41,880 --> 03:11:44,400
You must take full control of your own mind.

3120
03:11:44,860 --> 03:11:47,320
Reject all of the fantasies you have constructed.

3121
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:56,600
that a lot of the stuff i've seen here is personal and ugly
as hell i'll admit it hurts but it's not fooling me i know

3122
03:11:56,600 --> 03:12:05,220
it's fake good you are aware the part of you bent on
self-destruction is not but you must be careful just because

3123
03:12:05,220 --> 03:12:12,800
you know the lies for what they are that doesn't make the
danger looking at this guy i'll make it i don't have any

3124
03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:16,840
choice here i cannot come any further

3125
03:12:20,120 --> 03:12:20,920
I guess.

3126
03:12:21,440 --> 03:12:24,580
What does Zane do while we're, like, during all of this, you
know?

3127
03:12:25,540 --> 03:12:26,880
What is that guy doing?

3128
03:12:28,140 --> 03:12:28,820
Wait, what is this?

3129
03:12:28,980 --> 03:12:30,120
Oh, that's the moon, I think.

3130
03:12:33,260 --> 03:12:33,660
Memory.

3131
03:12:35,900 --> 03:12:38,140
Hey, let me tell you something, Alan.

3132
03:12:38,300 --> 03:12:38,880
My wife.

3133
03:12:38,980 --> 03:12:40,340
I know how your mind works.

3134
03:12:40,940 --> 03:12:43,240
You screw up, then you start analyzing it.

3135
03:12:43,260 --> 03:12:44,300
I thought she called me a screw up.

3136
03:12:44,560 --> 03:12:47,660
You start writing all these horror stories in your head,
don't you?

3137
03:12:47,740 --> 03:12:48,780
Come on, I don't do that.

3138
03:12:50,540 --> 03:12:52,000
Yes, you do.

3139
03:12:52,440 --> 03:12:53,740
I know how it goes.

3140
03:12:54,220 --> 03:12:55,340
You're a complete failure.

3141
03:12:55,900 --> 03:12:58,780
I hate you and I'll never forgive you for whatever it was
that you did.

3142
03:12:59,400 --> 03:12:59,940
Am I wrong?

3143
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:00,820
Oh, man.

3144
03:13:01,100 --> 03:13:02,780
I know you.

3145
03:13:03,060 --> 03:13:03,740
Oh, man.

3146
03:13:03,880 --> 03:13:05,920
But Alan, it's all in your head.

3147
03:13:06,480 --> 03:13:06,860
It is.

3148
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:10,040
I love you, and I'm not going anywhere.

3149
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:16,320
Oh, my wife.

3150
03:13:19,240 --> 03:13:19,800
Ignite.

3151
03:13:24,550 --> 03:13:25,510
The trees?

3152
03:13:26,150 --> 03:13:28,650
Oh, the lighthouse again.

3153
03:13:32,660 --> 03:13:33,220
Whoa!

3154
03:13:33,220 --> 03:13:34,460
One shot!

3155
03:13:36,540 --> 03:13:37,720
I thought I saw something.

3156
03:13:37,920 --> 03:13:38,640
Oh, oh my god.

3157
03:13:38,880 --> 03:13:39,600
Alan, be careful.

3158
03:13:39,980 --> 03:13:41,020
Alan doesn't know.

3159
03:13:41,700 --> 03:13:42,580
Alan can't see.

3160
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:45,100
Alan needs to up his prescription, I think.

3161
03:13:45,540 --> 03:13:46,860
They kept coming.

3162
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:49,080
There were too many of them.

3163
03:13:49,700 --> 03:13:52,920
Hards and hordes of them swarming over the landscape.

3164
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:54,160
Oh, it's a flashbang over there.

3165
03:13:55,660 --> 03:14:06,200
awake and this time they would get it with sheer numbers or
the or the lighthouse is a flashbang uh-oh clear

3166
03:14:18,660 --> 03:14:22,440
oh nice the

3167
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:28,900
lighthouse is on my side clear

3168
03:14:33,400 --> 03:14:36,680
whoa clear the

3169
03:14:40,640 --> 03:14:43,060
lighthouse is on my side Oh my god.

3170
03:14:43,580 --> 03:14:44,060
Clear!

3171
03:14:51,340 --> 03:14:52,200
Oh my god.

3172
03:14:52,820 --> 03:14:53,340
Holy!

3173
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:57,780
It's so awesome!

3174
03:14:58,860 --> 03:14:59,160
Clear!

3175
03:15:01,020 --> 03:15:01,480
Uh oh.

3176
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:03,860
Wait, Lighthouse, I need you again.

3177
03:15:04,740 --> 03:15:04,980
Ouch!

3178
03:15:05,260 --> 03:15:05,980
Lighthouse, I need you!

3179
03:15:06,360 --> 03:15:07,720
Thank you.

3180
03:15:11,260 --> 03:15:12,540
From behind!

3181
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:15,280
Ah!

3182
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:16,560
Oh my gosh.

3183
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:18,220
That was so stinking close.

3184
03:15:19,960 --> 03:15:20,760
Holy cow.

3185
03:15:33,300 --> 03:15:34,060
Oh my gosh.

3186
03:15:35,880 --> 03:15:40,020
I just kind of have to like fend for myself until we get the
flash.

3187
03:15:42,980 --> 03:15:43,380
No!

3188
03:15:45,300 --> 03:15:45,700
Ouch!

3189
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:46,500
Oh my gosh.

3190
03:15:47,400 --> 03:15:47,640
Ouch!

3191
03:15:51,270 --> 03:15:52,190
But it doesn't get everything.

3192
03:15:52,730 --> 03:15:53,730
It doesn't get all of them, I think.

3193
03:15:54,590 --> 03:15:56,410
Oh my god, oh my god, please!

3194
03:15:57,570 --> 03:15:58,010
Oh my god.

3195
03:15:58,250 --> 03:15:58,490
Ouch!

3196
03:15:58,610 --> 03:15:58,750
Ouch!

3197
03:16:06,460 --> 03:16:07,260
There we go.

3198
03:16:08,020 --> 03:16:08,760
Oh gosh.

3199
03:16:09,860 --> 03:16:13,460
I just have to get them like out of from behind the rocks
and uh...

3200
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:14,680
Yeah.

3201
03:16:15,100 --> 03:16:15,820
I can get this guy.

3202
03:16:16,300 --> 03:16:17,060
I'll take care of him.

3203
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:18,160
I'll take care of him.

3204
03:16:18,680 --> 03:16:19,080
Oh,

3205
03:16:33,270 --> 03:16:34,050
you jerk.

3206
03:16:38,520 --> 03:16:39,400
Trying to clear.

3207
03:16:43,520 --> 03:16:44,500
There we go.

3208
03:16:47,520 --> 03:16:47,980
Holy cow.

3209
03:16:48,400 --> 03:16:48,640
Holy...

3210
03:16:48,640 --> 03:16:50,100
Wait, what the hell did it just do that for?

3211
03:16:50,600 --> 03:16:51,260
Oh my god.

3212
03:16:53,420 --> 03:16:54,860
Oh my god!

3213
03:16:55,960 --> 03:16:57,060
I'm lost!

3214
03:16:57,260 --> 03:16:58,920
I'm like getting autopsy-turvy.

3215
03:17:00,040 --> 03:17:02,820
The camera angle is going crazy on me.

3216
03:17:04,860 --> 03:17:08,760
Oh my gosh, how much longer?

3217
03:17:10,220 --> 03:17:11,620
At least we got a checkpoint.

3218
03:17:12,900 --> 03:17:15,120
At least we got the checkpoint.

3219
03:17:18,340 --> 03:17:21,340
Oh my god, I can see more words in the...

3220
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:22,520

Here it comes.

3229
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:27,360
Incoming.

3230
03:18:30,680 --> 03:18:32,160
So many guys.

3231
03:18:33,140 --> 03:18:34,660
Really is like a horde that they said.

3232
03:18:36,360 --> 03:18:37,960
Really is the horde that they said.

3233
03:18:38,160 --> 03:18:38,520
was.

3234
03:18:38,720 --> 03:18:40,220

03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:44,220
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

Alan, run.

Ouch!

3239
03:18:51,900 --> 03:18:56,640
I was relieved to have made it here, but I wasn't sure what
was going to happen now.

3240
03:18:58,960 --> 03:18:59,460
Okay.

3241
03:19:00,420 --> 03:19:02,260
We made it to the lighthouse.

3242
03:19:02,760 --> 03:19:03,540
We made it.

3243
03:19:09,880 --> 03:19:11,420
Oh, I hear a video game.

3244
03:19:13,980 --> 03:19:15,400
I hear it.

3245
03:19:15,500 --> 03:19:16,080
I hear it.

3246
03:19:16,300 --> 03:19:16,880
It's going.

3247
03:19:17,880 --> 03:19:18,760
Where are you?

3248
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:21,180
Oh, you guys hear it too?

3249
03:19:22,640 --> 03:19:23,720
Maybe it's upstairs.

3250
03:19:26,960 --> 03:19:28,160
The ghost house.

3251
03:19:28,940 --> 03:19:30,140
Why is it the ghost house?

3252
03:19:38,200 --> 03:19:39,120
I can't see it.

3253
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:43,340
I wasn't sure what the dark presence had done to him if he
couldn't follow.

3254
03:19:43,940 --> 03:19:51,300
now on i was on my own no still he had got me this far i
would never have made it by myself this thing was going to

3255
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:58,900
end it wouldn't be long now what is going on in the real
world though because like rose was all messed up and then

3256
03:19:58,900 --> 03:20:05,460

curious what's going on

3257
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:11,820
while all this is happening Oh,

3258
03:20:18,630 --> 03:20:19,330
it's not on.

3259
03:20:19,990 --> 03:20:20,050
Oh.

3260
03:20:20,770 --> 03:20:21,350
Return?

3261
03:20:22,110 --> 03:20:22,410
Ouch!

3262
03:20:23,370 --> 03:20:23,950
How in...

3263
03:20:23,950 --> 03:20:25,050
I'm gonna...

3264
03:20:25,050 --> 03:20:25,890
I swear.

3265
03:20:29,690 --> 03:20:31,590
Wait for Alan Wake 2.

3266
03:20:31,810 --> 03:20:32,310
Dang!

3267
03:20:35,470 --> 03:20:38,390
It was a pretty wild deer fest.

3268
03:20:39,950 --> 03:20:41,850
I guess we'll find out in 2 then.

3269
03:20:42,010 --> 03:20:42,630
That's exciting.

3270
03:20:43,730 --> 03:20:44,110
Maybe.

3271
03:20:45,290 --> 03:20:46,050
Alan 2 is scary.

3272
03:20:46,070 --> 03:20:58,130
though no so what does that mean whoa i was surprised by the
change of scenery but not much i was starting to understand

I'm sorry!

3277
03:21:45,690 --> 03:21:48,210
That doesn't mean I don't have any feelings.

3278
03:21:51,810 --> 03:21:52,590
Sorry, Barry.

3279
03:21:55,510 --> 03:21:57,150
Why did we do it like this?

3280
03:21:58,030 --> 03:21:58,630
Oh my goodness.

3281
03:22:00,370 --> 03:22:02,750
Thing is, you need to get all rational here.

3282
03:22:03,090 --> 03:22:04,630
Abandon your fantasies, right?

3283
03:22:04,950 --> 03:22:07,170
Well, I kind of hate to say this, pal, but I'm one.

3284
03:22:08,050 --> 03:22:08,250
Fine.

3285
03:22:08,510 --> 03:22:09,130
You're abandoned.

3286
03:22:09,610 --> 03:22:09,830
Bye.

3287
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:16,440
You're abandoned.

3288
03:22:17,100 --> 03:22:17,100
Bye.

3289
03:22:17,520 --> 03:22:21,500
What are you going to say to me?

3290
03:22:22,720 --> 03:22:24,000
Oh, nothing this time?

3291
03:22:25,380 --> 03:22:25,580
Okay.

3292
03:22:26,560 --> 03:22:27,300
Okay, bye.

3293
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:34,380
At least Alan Wake doesn't have abandonment issues.

3294
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:35,460
Maybe.

3295
03:22:36,880 --> 03:22:37,460
Oh my god.

3296
03:22:37,860 --> 03:22:42,560
What a saying is the only way you're getting in that cabin
is through me.

3297
03:22:43,260 --> 03:22:44,620
It's one of those killings.

Are we gonna go kill Barry?

3304
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:32,440
What does it say about you?

3305
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:35,580
When you're this desperate to keep yourself from- No!

3306
03:23:36,320 --> 03:23:36,860
Barry!

3307
03:23:37,760 --> 03:23:40,420
I'm earning the 15% commission!

3308
03:23:40,760 --> 03:23:41,200
Barry!

3309
03:23:42,380 --> 03:23:43,780
I'm so disappointed in you!

3310
03:23:46,600 --> 03:23:53,700
It's great that you first make yourself an imaginary friend
and then you can't even get along with that guy people

03:24:24,500 --> 03:24:24,660
Uh...

3315
03:24:24,660 --> 03:24:25,220
Uh...

3316
03:24:25,220 --> 03:24:26,440
Uh...

3317
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:26,860
Uh...

3318
03:24:26,860 --> 03:24:27,640
Uh...

3319
03:24:27,640 --> 03:24:28,100
Uh...

3320
03:24:28,100 --> 03:24:28,120
Uh...

3321
03:24:28,120 --> 03:24:29,140
Oh my god, my aim.

3322
03:24:33,560 --> 03:24:35,720
Survive the assault is what it says.

3323
03:24:36,500 --> 03:24:36,800
Okay.

3324
03:24:40,080 --> 03:24:42,280
What if I just had unlimited...

3325
03:24:42,280 --> 03:24:42,820
Oh no!

3326
03:24:43,080 --> 03:24:43,740
My friends!

3327
03:24:44,140 --> 03:24:44,980
Oh my gosh.

3328
03:24:45,520 --> 03:24:46,240
Ouch!

3329
03:24:46,860 --> 03:24:47,580
...

3330
03:24:49,280 --> 03:24:51,200
Impulse control of a...

3331
03:24:51,200 --> 03:24:51,880
Impulse control.

3332
03:24:53,580 --> 03:24:53,840
Ouch.

3333
03:24:56,800 --> 03:25:00,460
I'm doing that so that birds don't get me, you know?

3334
03:25:01,100 --> 03:25:02,160
Oh, and they still do.

3335
03:25:02,360 --> 03:25:02,780
That's crazy.

3336
03:25:04,640 --> 03:25:05,160
Oh!

3337
03:25:05,280 --> 03:25:05,420
Oh!

3338
03:25:06,140 --> 03:25:06,300
Oh!

3339
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:10,620
Because they make money all the time.

3340
03:25:11,740 --> 03:25:13,420
Oh, I lost my unlimited everything!

3341
03:25:14,020 --> 03:25:14,420
Never mind.

3342
03:25:15,180 --> 03:25:15,640
Oh my god.

3343
03:25:15,960 --> 03:25:16,260
Oh!

3344
03:25:17,060 --> 03:25:18,240
Oh no, it's right here.

3345
03:25:18,460 --> 03:25:19,160
Oh my god.

3346
03:25:19,180 --> 03:25:21,060
I can't aim.

3347
03:25:22,780 --> 03:25:24,480
I can't aim.

3348
03:25:25,380 --> 03:25:26,340
I can't aim.

3349
03:25:27,220 --> 03:25:28,640
My unlimited batteries.

3350
03:25:29,680 --> 03:25:30,220
Where'd he go?

3351
03:25:31,220 --> 03:25:32,280
Are you speaking to me, Barry?

3352
03:25:32,640 --> 03:25:33,760
Sorry, I'm not paying attention.

3353
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:35,040
Where'd he go?

3354
03:25:35,200 --> 03:25:37,180
Oh, there he is.

3355
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:45,510
Uh-oh.

3356
03:25:49,720 --> 03:25:51,380
Shadow Barry saying things.

3357
03:25:52,920 --> 03:25:53,860
I haven't been paying attention.

3358
03:25:53,980 --> 03:25:54,560
It's totally not.

3359
03:26:01,060 --> 03:26:03,620
Oh my god!

3360
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:05,200
Barry, don't be so mean!

3361
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:08,040
Don't be so mean, Barry!

3362
03:26:09,960 --> 03:26:11,080
You're gonna regret that.

3363
03:26:11,180 --> 03:26:12,880
You're gonna regret hurting my feelings.

3364
03:26:15,680 --> 03:26:16,580
You're gonna regret that!

3365
03:26:17,460 --> 03:26:18,720
Dang, Barry's tanky.

3366
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:21,060
Oh!

3367
03:26:23,260 --> 03:26:23,940
Barry!

3368
03:26:24,180 --> 03:26:26,200
Billy running low on patience here!

3369
03:26:31,980 --> 03:26:32,580
Ouch!

3370
03:26:33,020 --> 03:26:33,720
Oh my gosh!

3371
03:26:34,420 --> 03:26:36,260
Stinking birds, man.

3372
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:44,900
Oh, why am I not using a flare?

3373
03:26:58,410 --> 03:27:00,970
You're driving me nuts!

3374
03:27:02,230 --> 03:27:03,030
You're driving me nuts.

3375
03:27:10,080 --> 03:27:10,360
Oh.

3376
03:27:11,100 --> 03:27:11,460
Ouch!

3377
03:27:19,290 --> 03:27:20,150
Where'd he go?

3378
03:27:21,010 --> 03:27:21,350
A bear?

3379
03:27:22,550 --> 03:27:22,770
Oh!

3380
03:27:24,530 --> 03:27:26,350
Wait, there's a shotgun right here.

3381
03:27:27,330 --> 03:27:27,710
Switch.

3382
03:27:28,910 --> 03:27:29,860
Where'd he go?

3383
03:27:53,700 --> 03:27:54,100
Nice.

3384
03:27:55,420 --> 03:27:56,340
Goodbye, not Barry.

3385
03:27:56,680 --> 03:27:59,200
I don't feel bad at shooting him because he's not Barry.

3386
03:28:01,460 --> 03:28:02,280
You know?

3387
03:28:02,720 --> 03:28:04,260
I don't feel so bad about it.

3388
03:28:04,840 --> 03:28:06,280
How do I enter the cabin?

3389
03:28:06,820 --> 03:28:07,740
Oh, over here.

3390
03:28:10,020 --> 03:28:11,600
Time to shoot me.

3391
03:28:14,060 --> 03:28:14,220
Oh.

3392
03:28:16,440 --> 03:28:17,880
Not our Barry.

3393
03:28:20,720 --> 03:28:23,560
Yeah, he was real mean, exactly.

3394
03:28:27,740 --> 03:28:30,780
Oh, God, he's just on the ground.

3395
03:28:33,540 --> 03:28:34,720
What's this happening to me?

3396
03:28:35,660 --> 03:28:37,220
Oh, he's so pathetic.

3397
03:28:38,660 --> 03:28:39,220
Give him a hug.

3398
03:28:39,300 --> 03:28:40,280
Give him a hug, Alan.

3399
03:28:40,800 --> 03:28:42,320
What is this happening to me?

3400
03:28:44,480 --> 03:28:46,620
I'm you, but cooler.

3401
03:28:48,560 --> 03:28:49,640
Just like that.

3402
03:28:50,340 --> 03:28:51,320
My mind was clear.

3403
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:52,400
Well, that's it.

3404
03:28:53,940 --> 03:28:57,020
I could think clearly again.

3405
03:28:57,240 --> 03:28:57,360
Oh.

3406
03:28:58,240 --> 03:29:00,860
But I couldn't survive in this place the way he had.

3407
03:29:01,160 --> 03:29:03,180
And I might not make it back a second time.

3408
03:29:04,820 --> 03:29:06,200
Leaving this place would be hard.

3409
03:29:08,100 --> 03:29:09,140
Maybe impossible.

3410
03:29:09,280 --> 03:29:10,380
Just write it, Bozo.

3411
03:29:10,660 --> 03:29:12,000
I got out.

3412
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:15,980
I left the dark world and I...

3413
03:29:15,980 --> 03:29:16,940
Am fine.

3414
03:29:17,860 --> 03:29:20,760
It was too easy to get lost in the dark place.

3415
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:25,680
If only that were that easy IRL, I know.

3416
03:29:25,700 --> 03:29:26,940
I was ready to curl up and die.

3417
03:29:27,840 --> 03:29:29,120
Let myself slip away.

3418
03:29:29,180 --> 03:29:31,300
Ready to curl up and die, this guy.

3419
03:29:31,460 --> 03:29:32,200
But here I was.

3420
03:29:33,500 --> 03:29:36,560
The yet unwritten future waiting to unfold before me.

3421
03:29:36,760 --> 03:29:37,920
Alan Wake 2.

3422
03:29:40,720 --> 03:29:42,700
Imagine, it just says that.

3423
03:29:42,820 --> 03:29:44,140
My name is Alan Wake.

3424
03:29:44,460 --> 03:29:45,180
And I'm a writer?

3425
03:29:45,600 --> 03:29:45,920
Yeah!

3426
03:29:47,060 --> 03:29:47,520
Yeah!

3427
03:29:54,530 --> 03:29:55,050
That's it!

3428
03:29:55,190 --> 03:29:56,190
That's the end of the DLC!

3429
03:29:58,270 --> 03:29:58,670
What?

3430
03:29:59,150 --> 03:30:00,210
What's going on?

3431
03:30:06,460 --> 03:30:08,700
I'm sorry, I fear...

3432
03:30:09,200 --> 03:30:10,340
These were not necessary.

3433
03:30:24,620 --> 03:30:27,500
Like, I could have predicted all of that was happening in
the darkness.

3434
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:35,860
Why was I told to... Why was I told to play these?

3435
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:42,840
Congrats on beating Alan Wake and you don't gotta wait 13
years for a sequel like I did.

3436
03:30:43,700 --> 03:30:45,020

03:31:00,370 --> 03:31:15,570

3438
03:31:16,910 --> 03:31:21,390

3439
03:31:25,610 --> 03:31:30,350

3440
03:31:33,030 --> 03:31:34,990
Thank you, Epic Games.

3441
03:31:44,680 --> 03:31:46,400
Elsie, I feel like I was so unnecessary.

3442
03:31:46,800 --> 03:31:54,080
I guess if you, like, you know, we were in the middle of
playing Alan Wake 1 and then Alan Wake 2 and waiting for

3443
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:59,240
more, like, waiting for Alan Wake 2 to happen, and you're
like, I'm just itching for some more Alan Wake.

3444
03:32:07,060 --> 03:32:14,830
action you got 20 guide i feel like it

3445
03:32:18,940 --> 03:32:24,660
i think i asked i think i was like what happens to berry i
can't remember if people said you'll find out in the dlc or

3446
03:32:24,660 --> 03:32:30,120
you find out in american nightmare but uh just a heads up i
don't plan on playing american nightmare sorry if that

3447
03:32:30,120 --> 03:32:36,420
disappoints you but i will play control and then Alan Wake
too.

3448
03:32:40,140 --> 03:32:42,120
Because his name is Alan Wake, he's a writer!

3449
03:32:49,490 --> 03:32:50,530
Character development.

3450
03:32:51,130 --> 03:32:52,670
Alan learned to not suck.

3451
03:32:53,390 --> 03:32:54,090
I guess that's fair.

3452
03:32:54,910 --> 03:32:55,590
That is true.

3453
03:32:58,070 --> 03:33:02,290
If you won't play American Nightmare, at least listen to its
song, Balance Slays the Demon.

3454
03:33:02,550 --> 03:33:05,430
My previous message about another town is a hidden message
in it.

3455
03:33:05,610 --> 03:33:07,350
Oh, I see, I see.

3456
03:33:09,070 --> 03:33:09,730
is a rioter?

3457
03:33:09,930 --> 03:33:11,390
I know, crazy, right?

3458
03:33:13,690 --> 03:33:14,790
Crazy, right?

3459
03:33:27,480 --> 03:33:28,000
Spoilers!

3460
03:33:29,900 --> 03:33:38,840
I enjoyed, I will say though, this first episode of this
DLC, the first one, I mean, I struggled hardcore.

3461
03:33:39,080 --> 03:33:40,360
I was stressed out though.

3462
03:33:40,360 --> 03:33:41,960
I was stressed out of my mind.

3463
03:33:41,980 --> 03:33:46,700
But the second one, oh, I liked the different kinds of
levels.

3464
03:33:46,900 --> 03:33:48,880
Like the Ferris wheel, that was pretty cool.

3465
03:33:49,640 --> 03:33:52,500
Like the different, and like the booms and everything.

3466
03:33:52,760 --> 03:33:54,640
Like there was stuff in it that was pretty fun.

3467
03:33:56,300 --> 03:33:58,340
Also, Ballad Slays the Demon is just a good song.

3468
03:33:58,840 --> 03:33:59,580
Thanks, Thomas.

3469
03:33:59,780 --> 03:34:01,300
Thank you so much for the super chats.

3470
03:34:02,820 --> 03:34:06,560
Oh, American Nightmare briefly shows what happens to Barry,
but doesn't go into depth.

3471
03:34:06,800 --> 03:34:07,500
Okay, okay.

3472
03:34:11,080 --> 03:34:11,960
Yeah, but...

3473
03:34:13,540 --> 03:34:22,200
skim through the video so you can see some silly mp mv stuff
or american nightmare that's i could do that probably but um

3474
03:34:22,200 --> 03:34:37,280
i uh i think you know uh playing the first level was a true
testament of my skills they were like you do you know alan

3475
03:34:37,280 --> 03:34:47,120
wake Since you don't plan to play American Nightmare, it's
revealed in that game that after Alan disappeared, he went

3476
03:34:47,120 --> 03:34:49,500
on to be an agent for old gods of Asgard.

3477
03:34:50,020 --> 03:34:52,220
Oh, Barry did.

3478
03:34:52,520 --> 03:34:53,080
Okay.

3479
03:34:55,260 --> 03:34:57,360
Oh, that's so sad.

3480
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:02,260
Does it say that he remembered everything, you know?

3481
03:35:02,380 --> 03:35:05,200
Like, he knows where Alan is.

3482
03:35:05,880 --> 03:35:07,380
Because I would hate for, you know.

3483
03:35:09,100 --> 03:35:10,480
That's so sad.

3484
03:35:12,420 --> 03:35:13,300
slash genuine?

3485
03:35:13,640 --> 03:35:14,520
You think so?

3486
03:35:21,360 --> 03:35:22,240
He's aware.

3487
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:26,220
The DLC for the second game will...

3488
03:35:26,220 --> 03:35:27,240
Wait, the game is better.

3489
03:35:27,460 --> 03:35:28,140
Second game is better.

3490
03:35:33,300 --> 03:35:38,640
American Nightmare also gives you a little bit of insight on
Mr. A little bit of insight on Mr. Scratch as he's the

3491
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:39,740
antagonist in that game.

3492
03:35:40,020 --> 03:35:41,960
That's the guy that... Yeah, that's the thing.

3493
03:35:41,980 --> 03:35:52,960
is like this game like Zane brings up Mr. Scratch and then
it's like no you don't know who that guy is oh

3494
03:35:57,120 --> 03:36:06,340
Mr. Scratch is a serial killer and torments Alice who is
still looking for Alan she's still looking for us I think

3495
03:36:06,340 --> 03:36:13,380
we've learned Alan is crazy and his words have power but he
can't get out of his own way but like three times over per

3496
03:36:13,380 --> 03:36:15,280
DLC good job Thank you!

3497
03:36:19,430 --> 03:36:21,890
Mr. Scratch is very important after this game.

3498
03:36:22,350 --> 03:36:22,350
Cool!

3499
03:36:22,550 --> 03:36:23,770
I'm excited then.

3500
03:36:26,950 --> 03:36:28,330
Excited, excited then.

3501
03:36:29,850 --> 03:36:31,810
Who are you cheering for in the Super Bowl?

3502
03:36:34,770 --> 03:36:35,430
Um...

3503
03:36:35,430 --> 03:36:37,870
I'm cheering for...

3504
03:36:37,870 --> 03:36:39,470
Uh, team...

3505
03:36:39,470 --> 03:36:40,670
Glorp, Glorp?

3506
03:36:41,610 --> 03:36:47,290
But, you know, I understand also that Zoop is also pretty
good.

3507
03:36:49,930 --> 03:36:51,050
So, uh...

3508
03:36:51,050 --> 03:36:52,070
I'm just...

3509
03:36:52,070 --> 03:36:53,430
I'm just here for the vibes.

3510
03:36:58,830 --> 03:37:01,050
That team kind of fell off?

3511
03:37:01,150 --> 03:37:01,470
No!

3512
03:37:02,090 --> 03:37:03,570
That's a hard take!

3513
03:37:06,330 --> 03:37:06,890
Who?

3514
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:07,650
I actually...

3515
03:37:07,650 --> 03:37:09,270
I have no idea who's...

3516
03:37:09,270 --> 03:37:11,150
I don't know anything about the Super Bowl.

3517
03:37:13,630 --> 03:37:15,750
I did see, though, the...

3518
03:37:15,770 --> 03:37:20,250
The one commercial that was Jurassic Park.

3519
03:37:22,310 --> 03:37:26,590
The plot is essentially Alan trying to escape through an
episode of Night Springs that he wrote.

3520
03:37:26,810 --> 03:37:28,110
It's the American Nightmare.

3521
03:37:28,470 --> 03:37:30,250
Wait, that's so fun sounding, though.

3522
03:37:31,410 --> 03:37:32,630
The premise sounds fun.

3523
03:37:33,370 --> 03:37:36,770
But I've heard that the gameplay gets a little...

3524
03:37:38,130 --> 03:37:41,950
But yeah, I'm excited to go into control.

3525
03:37:43,650 --> 03:37:45,750
I might take a break before I do.

3526
03:37:45,770 --> 03:37:53,990
it um but i am really i mean i started this so i could play
alan wake 2 so i'm very excited for alan wake 2.

3527
03:37:56,070 --> 03:38:09,630
go see hawks oh the patriots the lulley lulley lulley the
vibes for control are great where can i can i get it on

3528
03:38:09,630 --> 03:38:15,590
steam i haven't even bought it yet i do have alan wake 2.

3529
03:38:15,770 --> 03:38:17,770
It was a...

3530
03:38:20,590 --> 03:38:21,370
Oh.

3531
03:38:22,170 --> 03:38:28,390
I see on Steam they have Control Ultimate Edition.

3532
03:38:29,150 --> 03:38:32,730
It has very positive reviews.

3533
03:38:34,810 --> 03:38:36,010
Is it good?

3534
03:38:39,740 --> 03:38:45,340
Okay, I'm going to add it to my wish list and see if it goes
on sale.

3535
03:38:47,820 --> 03:38:48,940
That's the one.

3536
03:38:49,280 --> 03:38:49,800
Okay, okay.

3537
03:38:50,320 --> 03:38:50,320
Cool.

3538
03:38:51,040 --> 03:38:51,180
Cool.

3539
03:38:51,520 --> 03:38:51,520
Cool.

3540
03:38:51,720 --> 03:38:51,720
Cool.

3541
03:38:52,320 --> 03:38:52,320
Cool.

3542
03:38:53,300 --> 03:39:00,340
Winner of over 80 awards, Control is a visually stunning
third-person action-adventure that will keep you on the edge

3543
03:39:00,340 --> 03:39:01,020
of your seat.

3544
03:39:03,380 --> 03:39:14,060
Now, in the least, sorry, in the least spoiler-ly way you
can explain, what does Control, how is Control and Alan Wake

3545
03:39:14,060 --> 03:39:14,860
connected?

3546
03:39:14,980 --> 03:39:16,820
Are they like the same universe or?

3547
03:39:17,940 --> 03:39:26,960
um also i love that it says this similar to games you've
played and it shows silent hill f and outer wilds okay same

3548
03:39:26,960 --> 03:39:36,360
universe okay okay okay cool i've heard that it's like not
it's one of those things where it's like not super important

3549
03:39:36,360 --> 03:39:43,020
that you have to play but then like before alan wake to but
if you do play it before alan wake to you you kind of just

3550
03:39:43,020 --> 03:39:51,800
like are like ah during certain things you know I feel like
I compare it to like playing Metal Gear in timeline order

3551
03:39:51,800 --> 03:39:53,540
versus release order.

3552
03:39:54,180 --> 03:39:56,600
So it connects in cool ways.

3553
03:39:56,780 --> 03:39:57,620
Okay, cool, cool.

3554
03:39:59,000 --> 03:39:59,940
The Wakeverse.

3555
03:40:00,560 --> 03:40:02,780
Same world, some items and events overlap.

3556
03:40:03,420 --> 03:40:05,800
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

3557
03:40:08,960 --> 03:40:11,240
It gives a lot of context about what's happening.

3558
03:40:11,480 --> 03:40:12,920
Oh, I'm excited then.

3559
03:40:13,360 --> 03:40:16,680
I'm looking at like some of the screenshots from it.

3560
03:40:17,420 --> 03:40:20,700
We look like we play as like a badass bitch.

3561
03:40:21,420 --> 03:40:22,300
Hell yeah.

3562
03:40:22,620 --> 03:40:23,440
Oh, wait.

3563
03:40:23,600 --> 03:40:24,860
That thing's kind of ugly, creepy.

3564
03:40:25,820 --> 03:40:26,160
Uh-oh.

3565
03:40:28,440 --> 03:40:28,920
Exciting.

3566
03:40:30,880 --> 03:40:31,460
But yeah.

3567
03:40:31,700 --> 03:40:31,880
Wait.

3568
03:40:32,500 --> 03:40:34,800
I think I have a meeting tonight and I don't remember what
time.

3569
03:40:35,060 --> 03:40:36,700
Me and Densetsu girlies are meeting up.

3570
03:40:36,820 --> 03:40:36,980
Oh.

3571
03:40:37,360 --> 03:40:38,020
In an hour.

3572
03:40:38,640 --> 03:40:40,160
I think I'll go eat dinner then.

3573
03:40:40,820 --> 03:40:41,640
Thank you guys.

3574
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:46,560
Will we, I guess we, with this we have officially finished
Alan Wake 1.

3575
03:40:47,420 --> 03:40:50,660
So control will happen next.

3576
03:40:51,560 --> 03:40:52,340
Exciting, exciting.

3577
03:40:53,080 --> 03:40:53,720
Have a nice meal.

3578
03:40:54,180 --> 03:40:54,620
Thank you.

3579
03:40:54,680 --> 03:40:55,720
Thank you, thank you.

3580
03:40:56,300 --> 03:40:57,000
Remedyverse.

3581
03:40:59,300 --> 03:41:00,000
Remedyverse.

3582
03:41:00,940 --> 03:41:03,400
Control is what made me fall for remedy games.

3583
03:41:03,700 --> 03:41:03,840
Really?

3584
03:41:04,280 --> 03:41:06,120
I'm excited then.

3585
03:41:06,320 --> 03:41:07,140
Oh, I'm excited.

3586
03:41:07,220 --> 03:41:08,480
What else do they have?

3587
03:41:09,600 --> 03:41:10,240
Developer.

3588
03:41:11,280 --> 03:41:12,540
Control Resonant.

3589
03:41:13,200 --> 03:41:14,540
Is that like Control 2?

3590
03:41:17,500 --> 03:41:18,200
break.

3591
03:41:21,800 --> 03:41:23,100
Alan Wake's American Nightmare.

3592
03:41:24,140 --> 03:41:25,540
Max Payne.

3593
03:41:28,040 --> 03:41:29,820
That's a multiplayer thing.

3594
03:41:30,480 --> 03:41:31,380
Basically, yes.

3595
03:41:32,380 --> 03:41:34,520
Control got me into Alan Wake.

3596
03:41:34,740 --> 03:41:35,280
No way!

3597
03:41:37,460 --> 03:41:38,160
Oh.

3598
03:41:38,820 --> 03:41:39,660
Oh, yeah.

3599
03:41:39,740 --> 03:41:40,580
This isn't even out.

3600
03:41:40,880 --> 03:41:41,620
Oh my gosh.

3601
03:41:41,720 --> 03:41:44,220
Wait, we're getting into this at the perfect time then.

3602
03:41:46,280 --> 03:41:47,400
Explore a warped.

3603
03:41:47,420 --> 03:41:50,600
Maybe I shouldn't read that.

3604
03:41:51,920 --> 03:41:53,040
I leave.

3605
03:41:53,380 --> 03:41:54,180
I do not see.

3606
03:41:54,300 --> 03:41:54,960
I do not see.

3607
03:41:59,380 --> 03:41:59,700
Nice.

3608
03:42:04,180 --> 03:42:05,560
Quite the break is kind of awful.

3609
03:42:05,760 --> 03:42:07,100
More TV show than game.

3610
03:42:08,020 --> 03:42:09,080
You have to understand.

3611
03:42:09,860 --> 03:42:10,500
You have to understand.

3612
03:42:10,820 --> 03:42:12,160
I am Metal Gear fan.

3613
03:42:12,560 --> 03:42:13,240
I understand.

3614
03:42:14,140 --> 03:42:16,540
I understand movie over game.

3615
03:42:18,720 --> 03:42:22,120

villain quantum break is fun just not as good as controller

3620
03:42:58,260 --> 03:43:08,280
alan wake too it sounds like alan wake the first like what
we just played was kind of like the the the bottom of the

3621
03:43:08,280 --> 03:43:15,920
tier list rather like not that it's like bad but it's like
you know it only goes up from here so i'm very excited to

3624
03:43:31,120 --> 03:43:32,160

sam lake you hack affectionate we'll see if i ever get to do
max pain maybe one day maybe i gotta be like super remedy

3626
03:43:45,660 --> 03:43:48,240
pilled and I'll be like, I need more rippity games.

3627
03:43:50,780 --> 03:43:51,960
I need more.

3628
03:43:52,120 --> 03:43:52,900
I need more.

3629
03:43:54,260 --> 03:43:55,320
Twin Peaks, though.

3630
03:43:59,800 --> 03:44:00,860
You have Twin Peaks?

3631
03:44:02,600 --> 03:44:03,400
Mama Mia.

3632
03:44:06,720 --> 03:44:07,760
Mama Mia.

3633
03:44:09,360 --> 03:44:13,680
But yeah, I have no idea how much Netflix series Quantum
Break is.

3634
03:44:13,800 --> 03:44:15,480
It's like exact 50-50 split.

3635
03:44:15,900 --> 03:44:16,880
What does that mean?

3636
03:44:17,140 --> 03:44:17,400
I don't know.

3637
03:44:17,420 --> 03:44:18,780
What does that mean?

3638
03:44:21,280 --> 03:44:23,040
Of like cutscene versus game?

3639
03:44:25,420 --> 03:44:27,280
Doryko, thank you so much for the whole episode.

3640
03:44:30,780 --> 03:44:31,200
Thank you!

3641
03:44:31,520 --> 03:44:35,620
Epilogue Minto beat the self-absorbed and pretentious
writer's silly DLC.

3642
03:44:36,080 --> 03:44:41,320
TV Allen had tried to stress her out and make her quit, but
she was way too awesome to be stopped.

3643
03:44:41,820 --> 03:44:45,360
Minto got herself something nice and yummy as a reward and
had a happy and relaxing day.

3644
03:44:45,920 --> 03:44:46,760
Thank you!

3645
03:44:51,440 --> 03:44:56,700
Calling it Alan Wake the first makes it sound like he has
two little brothers in the same name.

3646
03:44:57,020 --> 03:44:57,600
He does.

3647
03:44:59,240 --> 03:44:59,980
He does.

3648
03:45:00,660 --> 03:45:04,100
I should open the game up because when I close out of it,
you don't hear it.

3649
03:45:04,180 --> 03:45:05,520
There's no like no PC ever anything.

3650
03:45:08,860 --> 03:45:12,560
You beat a chapter, then there's a full live action TV
episode to watch.

3651
03:45:13,060 --> 03:45:13,780
In Quantum Break.

3652
03:45:13,880 --> 03:45:14,680
Wait, that's insane.

3653
03:45:17,940 --> 03:45:20,720
I think Max Payne is a game you'd like just by itself.

3654
03:45:20,820 --> 03:45:21,380
Yeah?

3655
03:45:25,700 --> 03:45:29,000
You don't name siblings second or the third.

3656
03:45:29,620 --> 03:45:30,680
Alan Wake the third.

3657
03:45:34,480 --> 03:45:36,460
In the most non-spoilery way.

3658
03:45:38,660 --> 03:45:41,980
Do you think that there will be an Alan Wake 3?

3659
03:45:43,620 --> 03:45:45,720
If you've played Alan Wake 2?

3660
03:45:46,880 --> 03:45:47,780
I'm just curious.

3661
03:45:50,140 --> 03:45:50,580
Probably.

3662
03:45:50,880 --> 03:45:51,320
Definitely.

3663
03:45:51,580 --> 03:45:52,180
Yes, yes.

3664
03:45:52,580 --> 03:45:53,780
Yes, yes, probably.

3665
03:45:55,640 --> 03:45:56,800
With the...

3666
03:45:58,140 --> 03:46:00,240
They couldn't make Alan with Alan 3.

3667
03:46:05,670 --> 03:46:07,370
100% they confirmed it.

3668
03:46:07,470 --> 03:46:07,930
Wait, they did?

3669
03:46:14,560 --> 03:46:16,700
I don't know what Remedy is up to now.

3670
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:22,020
Well, clearly they're still doing stuff because they have
the Control Resonant coming out.

3671
03:46:22,220 --> 03:46:24,860
It says Dev is Remedy and Publishing is Remedy.

3672
03:46:25,320 --> 03:46:26,880
So that's on Steam.

3673
03:46:27,840 --> 03:46:29,800
So clearly they're still kicking it.

3674
03:46:29,820 --> 03:46:37,920
and they're still they're still uh wanting to do stuff and
still working on stuff so alan wake 3.

3675
03:46:39,800 --> 03:46:51,080
hopefully it doesn't take 13 years to make like the in
between alan wake and alan wake 2 right because because um

3676
03:46:51,080 --> 03:46:56,860
hopefully oh that sorry that was my controller because

3677
03:47:01,640 --> 03:47:05,730
Let me put my controller away.

3678
03:47:05,950 --> 03:47:06,530
One second, also.

3679
03:47:07,370 --> 03:47:08,610
One second, one second.

3680
03:47:16,570 --> 03:47:18,110
I would like to stream it.

3681
03:47:18,390 --> 03:47:21,330
And if it's a long time from now, I would kind of suck.

3682
03:47:22,950 --> 03:47:25,550
I don't know how long I'll be streaming for.

3683
03:47:26,110 --> 03:47:27,870
Just stream for 13 years.

3684
03:47:28,830 --> 03:47:29,110
Yeah?

3685
03:47:29,690 --> 03:47:31,950
You'll still be around in 13 years?

3686
03:47:33,710 --> 03:47:35,930
You'll still be hanging out with me in 13 years?

3687
03:47:37,130 --> 03:47:39,190
Are you going anywhere in the next 10 years?

3688
03:47:39,470 --> 03:47:40,150
I have no idea.

3689
03:47:41,270 --> 03:47:42,550
What if someday I see the light?

3690
03:47:46,430 --> 03:47:48,330
13 years stream with the line.

3691
03:47:51,490 --> 03:47:59,550
Hey, if you still find me fun, I mean, it'd be fun to keep
streaming then for as long as I could.

3692
03:48:07,700 --> 03:48:08,180
Oh.

3693
03:48:09,980 --> 03:48:11,660
But I'm going to go eat dinner now.

3694
03:48:11,780 --> 03:48:12,860
Thank you, guys.

3695
03:48:13,200 --> 03:48:17,480
Thank you, thank you, thank you for having so much fun with
me.

3696
03:48:18,360 --> 03:48:22,880
Thanks for, thank you for pushing me through the first
episode.

3697
03:48:24,260 --> 03:48:26,040
And the encouragement and everything.

3698
03:48:27,180 --> 03:48:28,040
I appreciate it.

3699
03:48:28,760 --> 03:48:30,840
It was a tough one, but we powered through.

3700
03:48:30,980 --> 03:48:32,740
I didn't even need to reset to easy mode.

3701
03:48:33,020 --> 03:48:34,120
We just did it.

3702
03:48:34,740 --> 03:48:35,740
We did it, baby.

3703
03:48:37,280 --> 03:48:38,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3704
03:48:39,980 --> 03:48:40,680
Thank you guys!

3705
03:48:41,020 --> 03:48:42,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3706
03:48:42,400 --> 03:48:43,240
We believed!

3707
03:48:43,540 --> 03:48:44,240
We believed!

3708
03:48:45,800 --> 03:48:46,480
She's a gamer!

3709
03:48:47,080 --> 03:48:48,160
Fun stream today!

3710
03:48:48,300 --> 03:48:48,920
Thank you!

3711
03:48:49,680 --> 03:48:50,080
Thank you!

3712
03:48:50,580 --> 03:48:50,740
Thank you!

3713
03:48:53,120 --> 03:48:53,600
Um...

3714
03:48:53,600 --> 03:48:55,160
See you next time probably on Tuesday.

3715
03:48:55,740 --> 03:48:56,900
Uh, well I will be streaming!

3716
03:48:57,660 --> 03:48:58,740
I still don't know what I...

3717
03:48:58,740 --> 03:49:00,620
Guys, I don't know what I'm streaming this week.

3718
03:49:00,880 --> 03:49:02,280
I'm streaming Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

3719
03:49:02,860 --> 03:49:04,640
Because I have my jazz show on Friday.

3720
03:49:05,060 --> 03:49:06,280
So I won't be streaming Thursday.

3721
03:49:06,760 --> 03:49:07,240
Spank!

3722
03:49:07,340 --> 03:49:08,280
Thank you so much!

3723
03:49:08,800 --> 03:49:09,280
Uh...

3724
03:49:09,980 --> 03:49:10,840
Pretty good.

3725
03:49:13,100 --> 03:49:18,020
But, um, part of me wants to play, uh, oh my gosh, what's it
called?

3726
03:49:20,540 --> 03:49:23,800
Okay, I want to play Jurassic World Evolution 3.

3727
03:49:24,040 --> 03:49:24,880
Okay, here's my dilemma.

3728
03:49:26,280 --> 03:49:30,760
Jurassic World Evolution is basically like zoo tycoon, but
with dinosaurs.

3729
03:49:32,920 --> 03:49:35,820
But the reviews say...

3730
03:49:35,820 --> 03:49:38,580
The reviews say that...

3731
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:50,080
good, but it's not great for the price because it's just
like the first and second one, you know?

3732
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:53,060
But I never played the first and second one.

3733
03:49:53,600 --> 03:50:01,240
So I was like, maybe it's okay that I only get the third
one, but then also it's $60.

3734
03:50:02,740 --> 03:50:04,780
So I was like, I wish it were on sale.

3735
03:50:07,760 --> 03:50:09,960
Is that the one with Jeff Goldblum talking to you?

3736
03:50:09,980 --> 03:50:11,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3737
03:50:12,740 --> 03:50:13,100
Hmm.

3738
03:50:13,860 --> 03:50:15,480
It's probably fine to only play three then.

3739
03:50:16,100 --> 03:50:16,500
Probably, right?

3740
03:50:17,120 --> 03:50:17,540
$60.

3741
03:50:18,180 --> 03:50:18,780
I'm like, dang.

3742
03:50:19,400 --> 03:50:21,340
I've been spoiled by indie games, I think.

3743
03:50:22,960 --> 03:50:25,340
Meantora, we'll watch you stream until I can't anymore.

3744
03:50:25,600 --> 03:50:26,800
Your streams are always a lot of fun.

3745
03:50:26,840 --> 03:50:27,820
I'm very comfy to watch.

3746
03:50:28,240 --> 03:50:29,880
Teyaki, thank you.

3747
03:50:31,680 --> 03:50:36,260
Yeah, people were saying that 60 is, like, a lot for it
because it's so similar to two.

3748
03:50:37,000 --> 03:50:39,080
In those games, you can do a ride POV.

3749
03:50:39,980 --> 03:50:41,760
place your missing park experience.

3750
03:50:42,580 --> 03:50:43,360
You know!

3751
03:50:43,780 --> 03:50:46,880
You know, somebody recreated Dinosaur the Ride in Minecraft.

3752
03:50:47,740 --> 03:50:48,400
There's a server.

3753
03:50:48,500 --> 03:50:49,880
There's like a...

3754
03:50:49,880 --> 03:50:52,860
There's a server you can go to and you can ride Dinosaur the
Ride.

3755
03:50:56,400 --> 03:50:58,540
And it has the in...

3756
03:50:59,980 --> 03:51:02,340
The ride audio and everything.

3757
03:51:10,110 --> 03:51:11,470
Dino Mudge.

3758
03:51:12,990 --> 03:51:13,050
Dino Mudge.

3759
03:51:15,120 --> 03:51:15,580
Mudge.

3760
03:51:16,460 --> 03:51:18,340
Minecraft crazy people for the win.

3761
03:51:18,940 --> 03:51:20,120
True, true, true.

3762
03:51:20,960 --> 03:51:22,900
But yeah, I- I get how arrogant I too.

3763
03:51:23,260 --> 03:51:23,700
Blue!

3764
03:51:25,160 --> 03:51:26,120
What is spooky?

3765
03:51:26,160 --> 03:51:28,040
Oh, spooky, spooky donut.

3766
03:51:28,720 --> 03:51:30,480
Dinosaur Zoo Game buttons!

3767
03:51:31,220 --> 03:51:32,720
Go get those dinoes.

3768
03:51:34,180 --> 03:51:35,600
What the heck?

3769
03:51:35,840 --> 03:51:36,740
Thank you.

3770
03:51:42,380 --> 03:51:44,940
Obviously, I mean, you know, it's more so...

3771
03:51:47,180 --> 03:51:49,440
I could afford it.

3772
03:51:50,460 --> 03:52:03,060
place but it's more so like uh like uh how do i say you know
when i see reviews of people being like this game should

3773
03:52:03,060 --> 03:52:13,560
have been a dlc for the second game or things like that you
know i don't want to reward money hungry behavior you know

3774
03:52:13,560 --> 03:52:23,780
what i mean yeah it's the principle of the matter like i
want to be a responsible shopper and I want to you know I

3775
03:52:23,780 --> 03:52:34,160
want to be like I mean I appreciate it so much I don't want
to be like boo your dono but it's more of a glorified

3776
03:52:34,160 --> 03:52:45,900
expansion it's just yeah like I I want to be you know I want
to be someone who thinks that if something is really good

3777
03:52:45,900 --> 03:52:54,360
then I will you know especially that much money it's a good
mindset you think so

3778
03:52:58,500 --> 03:53:04,960
I don't base my opinion on reviews I try it myself or do my
own research on it I think reviews are research note a

3779
03:53:04,960 --> 03:53:10,780
little bit but definitely understand wanting to be careful
with your money I think reviews I mean obviously you're

3780
03:53:10,780 --> 03:53:19,340
going to get biased reviews sometimes but if you read a good
amount of them I think that you especially i think someone

3781
03:53:19,340 --> 03:53:33,520
saying that the a game is a a sixty dollar game is a being a
being a expansion of another game that was just as expensive

3782
03:53:33,520 --> 03:53:46,740
and could have just been a uh a dlc or something is like a
good valid criticism you know that's how i think that's

3783
03:53:52,090 --> 03:53:54,590
License games are always outrageously expensive.

3784
03:53:54,770 --> 03:53:55,090
You know what?

3785
03:53:55,250 --> 03:53:56,810
That's so true.

3786
03:53:57,950 --> 03:53:59,290
That's so true.

3787
03:54:04,530 --> 03:54:07,090
Reviews are useful for figuring out both expectations.

3788
03:54:07,590 --> 03:54:07,590
Right.

3789
03:54:08,110 --> 03:54:09,030
Don't get me wrong.

3790
03:54:09,170 --> 03:54:10,510
There are so many positive reviews.

3791
03:54:10,530 --> 03:54:13,750
It says mostly positive for the thing.

3792
03:54:13,810 --> 03:54:16,530
I don't think it, like, crashes or runs poorly.

3793
03:54:17,370 --> 03:54:19,370
But I'm also just like, dang, it's kind of stinky that
summer.

3794
03:54:19,390 --> 03:54:21,270
Some people are like, man, this...

3795
03:54:21,270 --> 03:54:24,770
I had to pay for the same game again, just with a few more
features.

3796
03:54:25,370 --> 03:54:25,770
I don't know.

3797
03:54:25,930 --> 03:54:27,230
I might just get it.

3798
03:54:29,330 --> 03:54:31,630
Because I want to play Dinosaur Tycoon.

3799
03:54:33,390 --> 03:54:34,710
And it has a Ketzalcoat Atlas.

3800
03:54:34,890 --> 03:54:35,970
I want him.

3801
03:54:37,970 --> 03:54:40,910
If it has him, I want that guy.

3802
03:54:42,310 --> 03:54:46,530
And he was in Jurassic World, so he should probably be in
the game.

3803
03:54:47,010 --> 03:54:47,890
Right little guy.

3804
03:54:48,470 --> 03:54:49,370
Right little guy.

3805
03:54:49,390 --> 03:54:51,910
I have a Quetzalcoatl this figure on my desk.

3806
03:54:53,390 --> 03:54:54,370
He's so cute.

3807
03:55:01,660 --> 03:55:03,980
They should make a ride about that.

3808
03:55:04,880 --> 03:55:05,400
Agreed.

3809
03:55:08,980 --> 03:55:10,360
Call it up like he's a cat.

3810
03:55:10,840 --> 03:55:11,740
He's a baby.

3811
03:55:12,500 --> 03:55:13,760
He's my little baby.

3812
03:55:14,400 --> 03:55:16,880
He's sitting right on my desk next to Snake.

3813
03:55:18,820 --> 03:55:21,600
In fact, I have two snakes on my desk because I got two
more.

3814
03:55:21,620 --> 03:55:30,280
I gave one to Mogu and then I got two more to replace the
one that I lost I didn't lose him I gave him away but you

3815
03:55:30,280 --> 03:55:38,700
know I got two more to replace it's kind of like if you cut
off the head of a hydra then two more grow back it's the

3816
03:55:38,700 --> 03:55:46,020
same but my bag that I keep my little snakes in is full so I
can only

3817
03:55:49,320 --> 03:55:54,700
so I can only I can only I have to keep two of them on my
desk.

3818
03:55:57,540 --> 03:55:58,700
Deploying the snakes.

3819
03:55:59,940 --> 03:56:00,440
Yeah.

3820
03:56:02,760 --> 03:56:08,200
I'll take a picture and show you guys my Ketzel Kowatles and
my Snakes and my Hanamaru Obake.

3821
03:56:08,580 --> 03:56:09,240
They're all together.

3822
03:56:09,640 --> 03:56:12,660
It's like everything that I love in one little area.

3823
03:56:15,280 --> 03:56:17,460
Now you need another bag, truly.

3824
03:56:18,440 --> 03:56:21,460
I want to get an Eda bag that just is full of them.

3825
03:56:21,620 --> 03:56:22,980
Full of my little men.

3826
03:56:26,660 --> 03:56:28,580
Full of my little men.

3827
03:56:29,540 --> 03:56:30,680
The Snake Shrine.

3828
03:56:31,060 --> 03:56:32,820
Yes, yes, yes.

3829
03:56:34,700 --> 03:56:35,260
More.

3830
03:56:36,260 --> 03:56:38,200
Do you have any interest in playing Terraria?

3831
03:56:39,860 --> 03:56:41,580
It's not that I don't have an interest.

3832
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:43,140
I have played it before.

3833
03:56:44,680 --> 03:56:48,120
But I think it's easier and more fun with friends.

3834
03:56:48,300 --> 03:56:49,660
I think it's one of those types of games.

3835
03:56:50,040 --> 03:56:51,260
Spread my code.

3836
03:56:52,980 --> 03:56:59,120
Speaking of dinosaurs, they found a fossil in China of one
that was apparently covered in porcupine-esque quills.

3837
03:56:59,900 --> 03:57:01,820
Maddie, what was it called?

3838
03:57:02,380 --> 03:57:02,540
What?

3839
03:57:02,700 --> 03:57:03,420
That sounds awesome.

3840
03:57:04,820 --> 03:57:05,640
I'm gonna look it up.

3841
03:57:06,460 --> 03:57:06,660
Oh?

3842
03:57:08,160 --> 03:57:09,060
My god.

3843
03:57:10,800 --> 03:57:12,180
I just realized...

3844
03:57:12,180 --> 03:57:12,440
Okay.

3845
03:57:13,420 --> 03:57:14,540
My phone.

3846
03:57:14,820 --> 03:57:15,600
Are you okay?

3847
03:57:17,200 --> 03:57:19,620
Right before stream, I was watching...

3848
03:57:20,180 --> 03:57:20,920
Oh my god.

3849
03:57:21,120 --> 03:57:21,600
No.

3850
03:57:21,620 --> 03:57:23,800
I was watching some TikToks.

3851
03:57:24,820 --> 03:57:28,440
I had my phone face down so I couldn't see it.

3852
03:57:29,180 --> 03:57:30,100
And I just picked it up.

3853
03:57:30,200 --> 03:57:33,960
And it's been playing the same TikTok, probably for the past
four hours.

3854
03:57:34,700 --> 03:57:35,840
Oh my god.

3855
03:57:40,600 --> 03:57:42,320
And it's like...

3856
03:57:43,380 --> 03:57:45,780
It's a TikTok of one of the...

3857
03:57:45,780 --> 03:57:46,700
Oh my god.

3858
03:57:47,600 --> 03:57:49,540
One of the Broadway shows of Wicked.

3859
03:57:50,500 --> 03:57:55,580
So now my timeline is probably going to be like, this girl
loves wicked.

3860
03:57:56,740 --> 03:57:58,660
Yeah, my algo is cooked!

3861
03:58:00,120 --> 03:58:00,580
No!

3862
03:58:02,660 --> 03:58:05,840
It's gonna be there like, don't give her anything else.

3863
03:58:06,320 --> 03:58:07,860
She only wants wicked.

3864
03:58:09,440 --> 03:58:09,840
No!

3865
03:58:15,040 --> 03:58:19,520
Oh my God, it's been playing this whole time.

3866
03:58:28,000 --> 03:58:31,340
She watched this video for four hours straight.

3867
03:58:31,840 --> 03:58:42,680
I sure hope that the person that posted this can't see it
like what if i'm the top watcher i probably am there's no

3868
03:58:42,680 --> 03:58:48,020
way any of any other person is watching this video more than
i have at this point

3869
03:58:52,480 --> 03:59:03,300
is this girl okay it's what i fall asleep to i just can't
help it oh my god no why why did i pick up my phone oh i was

3870
03:59:03,300 --> 03:59:11,580
looking for the dinosaurs Dinosaur, China, poor cute pine.

3871
03:59:13,720 --> 03:59:14,680
Whales.

3872
03:59:15,840 --> 03:59:17,900
Gotta nuke my alga with just minto.

3873
03:59:18,140 --> 03:59:19,420
It already is.

3874
03:59:20,600 --> 03:59:22,480
It's so funny.

3875
03:59:22,960 --> 03:59:23,080
Oh!

3876
03:59:26,680 --> 03:59:30,960
A dinosaur with spikes exhibiting unprecedented properties
discovered in China.

3877
03:59:32,180 --> 03:59:32,580
Eww.

3878
03:59:33,120 --> 03:59:34,600
This thing looks ugly.

3879
03:59:38,480 --> 03:59:40,220
The reconstruction of it.

3880
03:59:40,380 --> 03:59:41,360
What the hell?

3881
03:59:45,640 --> 03:59:48,160
It looks like...

3882
03:59:52,020 --> 03:59:54,900
It looks like...

3883
03:59:54,900 --> 03:59:58,640
Like a bird with sharp feathers, you know?

3884
04:00:00,200 --> 04:00:00,840
Neat.

3885
04:00:01,740 --> 04:00:03,060
Dino in shambles.

3886
04:00:03,660 --> 04:00:10,060
If you ever want to see the saddest downgrade of a dinosaur,
check out the Spinosaur.

3887
04:00:11,260 --> 04:00:13,100
That guy looked so cool.

3888
04:00:14,300 --> 04:00:21,200
And then over time they were like, I think he looks a little
bit more like he kept evolving.

3889
04:00:21,340 --> 04:00:23,880
Like the reconstruction of him.

3890
04:00:24,320 --> 04:00:25,260
Like kept, kept.

3891
04:00:25,500 --> 04:00:27,740
They're like, ah, maybe this isn't so accurate.

3892
04:00:28,020 --> 04:00:28,860
And they just kept.

3893
04:00:29,440 --> 04:00:31,400
Now he looks like a nerdy bird.

3894
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:34,740
Didn't they try and make it a seal?

3895
04:00:34,940 --> 04:00:36,940
It really looks something very similar.

3896
04:00:37,560 --> 04:00:40,060
So it's very different.

3897
04:00:40,080 --> 04:00:40,460
funny.

3898
04:00:42,620 --> 04:00:43,040
It's fine.

3899
04:00:43,180 --> 04:00:45,620
We love all iterations of the Spinosaurus.

3900
04:00:51,550 --> 04:00:54,210
Google Autofill, Spinosaurus, Downgrade meme.

3901
04:00:54,770 --> 04:00:54,770
No!

3902
04:00:56,990 --> 04:01:01,470
They're embarrassed about Jurassic Park 3, so they've been
nerfing it ever since.

3903
04:01:03,010 --> 04:01:04,410
Jurassic Park!

3904
04:01:07,250 --> 04:01:11,150
I think my biggest qualm about Jurassic Park is

3905
04:01:16,150 --> 04:01:18,270
like dinosaurs that they make.

3906
04:01:19,150 --> 04:01:22,070
So that, like, there's just fake dinos.

3907
04:01:22,350 --> 04:01:24,550
And I feel like sometimes people are going to think they're
real.

3908
04:01:27,610 --> 04:01:29,370
I really don't like the...

3909
04:01:29,370 --> 04:01:31,630
I'm like, there's so many dinosaurs.

3910
04:01:32,170 --> 04:01:34,270
There are actually so many dinosaurs.

3911
04:01:34,430 --> 04:01:36,170
And you have to make...

3912
04:01:36,170 --> 04:01:37,410
You have to make one up.

3913
04:01:40,410 --> 04:01:41,930
It's so strange.

3914
04:01:51,280 --> 04:01:52,600
Velociraptors aren't real.

3915
04:01:54,560 --> 04:01:56,100
Dinosaurs couldn't turn invisible?

3916
04:01:57,420 --> 04:01:58,180
Wait, I actually...

3917
04:01:58,180 --> 04:01:59,340
I don't even know that one.

3918
04:02:00,040 --> 04:02:01,180
I haven't watched, like...

3919
04:02:01,180 --> 04:02:03,520
I've only watched the most recent Jurassic World.

3920
04:02:03,660 --> 04:02:05,480
I haven't watched, like, the first couple of them.

3921
04:02:06,580 --> 04:02:08,580
A lot of inaccuracies in the first one, too.

3922
04:02:08,840 --> 04:02:09,300
Oh, yeah.

3923
04:02:10,020 --> 04:02:11,800
I mean, Jurassic Park...

3924
04:02:11,800 --> 04:02:13,420
Yeah, I mean...

3925
04:02:13,420 --> 04:02:17,000
I think that's always probably gonna be the case, unless we
can learn cloning.

3926
04:02:17,140 --> 04:02:18,500
We'll never know what, uh...

3927
04:02:19,480 --> 04:02:24,360
Dinosaur truly looks like unless we are able to bring one to
life, you know?

3928
04:02:28,040 --> 04:02:31,520
They gave the dinos the stealth suit.

3929
04:02:33,260 --> 04:02:36,580
The first one has cuttlefish genes and can turn invisible.

3930
04:02:42,470 --> 04:02:43,410
Or time travel.

3931
04:02:43,770 --> 04:02:44,930
Right, right, right.

3932
04:02:46,350 --> 04:02:48,170
Minto telling us to clone dinosaurs.

3933
04:02:52,460 --> 04:02:53,120
Terrifying.

3934
04:02:54,280 --> 04:02:56,020
Terrifying thought.

3935
04:02:57,020 --> 04:02:58,740
This elevator's too heavy!

3936
04:03:00,880 --> 04:03:03,280
Cheetosaurus, Verizon Raptor.

3937
04:03:03,680 --> 04:03:05,340
What is this?

3938
04:03:08,460 --> 04:03:23,740
I think, though, it's fun when, like, when some dinosaurs
get more recognition because of Jurassic Park, though.

3939
04:03:24,360 --> 04:03:24,960
That's fine.

3940
04:03:25,640 --> 04:03:25,900
You know?

3941
04:03:27,800 --> 04:03:29,920
Yeah, did you guys see the new Netflix show?

3942
04:03:30,340 --> 04:03:31,320
I don't remember.

3943
04:03:31,440 --> 04:03:32,540
I think it's, like, dinosaur.

3944
04:03:32,980 --> 04:03:38,780
It might just be called Dinosaur, the new Netflix, like,
dinosaur documentary thingy thing.

3945
04:03:39,800 --> 04:03:40,300
Exciting.

3946
04:03:41,880 --> 04:03:44,580
I'll keep Netflix for another day, I guess.

3947
04:03:45,920 --> 04:03:48,920
I will keep Netflix for one more day.

3948
04:03:49,860 --> 04:03:51,260
The one narrated by Morgan Freeman.

3949
04:03:51,420 --> 04:03:52,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3950
04:03:55,920 --> 04:03:57,780
Ever thought of playing ARC?

3951
04:04:01,190 --> 04:04:05,250
From my understanding, ARC is also a game that's better
multiplayer?

3952
04:04:08,810 --> 04:04:10,930
Or at least I've only seen it multiplayer?

3953
04:04:12,690 --> 04:04:14,410
And also, I've heard it's very sweaty.

3954
04:04:14,990 --> 04:04:15,290
Yes.

3955
04:04:16,150 --> 04:04:18,650
I've also heard that it's very, very sweaty.

3956
04:04:19,210 --> 04:04:20,710
Like a, yeah, a time sink.

3957
04:04:23,850 --> 04:04:24,430
So...

3958
04:04:25,950 --> 04:04:28,610
Probably not, unfortunately.

3959
04:04:31,170 --> 04:04:31,810
Arc seems scary.

3960
04:04:36,190 --> 04:04:37,770
Genius park idea.

3961
04:04:38,130 --> 04:04:42,870
Oh, a park exhibit, designer dino who can be invisible and
not seen whatever it wants.

3962
04:04:44,930 --> 04:04:47,650
Come and see it, everyone, if it feels like it.

3963
04:04:48,390 --> 04:04:50,410
Maybe the dinosaurs watch along.

3964
04:04:50,870 --> 04:04:52,430
That might be fun.

3965
04:04:52,930 --> 04:04:53,890
That could be fun.

3966
04:04:55,510 --> 04:04:57,170
Aibool Arc server.

3967
04:04:57,930 --> 04:05:00,570
You guys are gonna just murder me.

3968
04:05:02,190 --> 04:05:03,690
You guys would just come...

3969
04:05:03,690 --> 04:05:05,370
Actually, do I... I think I own Arc.

3970
04:05:05,490 --> 04:05:06,710
I think I played it once.

3971
04:05:08,910 --> 04:05:09,830
Oh, I do!

3972
04:05:10,030 --> 04:05:10,650
I do!

3973
04:05:13,270 --> 04:05:14,610
165 gigabytes later.

3974
04:05:15,110 --> 04:05:19,930
I don't even think I have enough space on my computer to be
honest.

3975
04:05:20,390 --> 04:05:20,710
Wait.

3976
04:05:20,990 --> 04:05:21,550
I have...

3977
04:05:23,950 --> 04:05:25,470
Oh, I cleared up some games.

3978
04:05:25,490 --> 04:05:27,590
I have 200 gigs left.

3979
04:05:29,930 --> 04:05:31,490
I'll take up, I'll take up.

3980
04:05:33,830 --> 04:05:35,570
Yeah, time for a new drive.

3981
04:05:35,990 --> 04:05:36,410
For real.

3982
04:05:37,130 --> 04:05:37,790
For real.

3983
04:05:50,240 --> 04:05:50,760
Cool.

3984
04:05:51,800 --> 04:05:54,520
Well guys, I am gonna head out now though.

3985
04:05:55,700 --> 04:05:57,940
Thank you again for hanging out with me.

3986
04:05:58,520 --> 04:05:59,320
Alan Wake.

3987
04:05:59,860 --> 04:06:01,020
waking up with me.

3988
04:06:01,540 --> 04:06:02,380
It was a good time.

3989
04:06:02,780 --> 04:06:03,840
It wasn't all good time.

3990
04:06:04,040 --> 04:06:05,600
It's always a good time with you guys.

3991
04:06:05,960 --> 04:06:08,480
So, the game...

3992
04:06:09,720 --> 04:06:12,060
But, with you guys, it's always a good time.

3993
04:06:12,620 --> 04:06:14,960
So, enjoy your dinner.

3994
04:06:15,100 --> 04:06:15,640
Thank you.

3995
04:06:15,820 --> 04:06:16,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3996
04:06:17,640 --> 04:06:18,360
Thank you, thank you.

3997
04:06:18,660 --> 04:06:22,240
We just stayed on the Alan Wake screen.

3998
04:06:23,600 --> 04:06:28,120
I forgot to move over to my bedroom or the cafe.

3999
04:06:28,840 --> 04:06:29,520
Oh, my god.

4000
04:06:29,980 --> 04:06:32,920
Wait, can I leak something?

4001
04:06:36,360 --> 04:06:48,520
I, after the last Densetsu collab, you know, we kind of, we,
we host them, host the collabs, like on our, on our own

4002
04:06:48,520 --> 04:06:49,020
computers.

4003
04:06:49,300 --> 04:06:54,560
And I was, after the last one, like, so we have, like, our
own loading music and everything when we, when we do that.

4004
04:06:54,700 --> 04:07:01,680
And I was like, can we get, like, a Densetsu BGM, like, of,
Like, Densetsu MVPs or something.

4005
04:07:02,940 --> 04:07:05,560
I was like, can we get, like, a Bossa Nova version or
something?

4006
04:07:05,960 --> 04:07:06,740
And, oh my gosh.

4007
04:07:07,640 --> 04:07:09,100
It's so cute.

4008
04:07:09,400 --> 04:07:13,440
I want to use it for, like, my BGM when I'm talking in the
future and stuff.

4009
04:07:13,700 --> 04:07:14,960
I'm going to leak a little bit of it.

4010
04:07:15,060 --> 04:07:15,280

4011
04:07:16,640 --> 04:07:17,940
Nobody said I can't.

4012
04:07:23,000 --> 04:07:23,980
It's so cute.

4013
04:07:43,220 --> 04:07:44,760
Makes me want a jazz version.

4014
04:07:44,940 --> 04:07:47,480
Or, like, a, you know, like a chill version of the song now.

04:07:50,100 --> 04:07:51,700
