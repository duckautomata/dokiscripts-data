131
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,190

132
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,290

136
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,590
Why won't I wake up?

137
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,050
I'm trying to revive you.

138
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,930

139
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,270

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,390

145
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,670

146
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,210

Yeah, we can hear you.

153
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,640
I have a nice relax.

154
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,400
Get this baby in the car.

155
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,640
Okay, baby.

156
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,220
Then you'll have a nice rest.

157
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,340
You'll be fine.

158
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,180
I'm gonna pick up all our stuff so that we aren't littering,
you know.

159
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,300
Oh, that's very responsible.

160
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,400
We got some scrap metal.

161
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,380
That's very responsible of you, you're right.

162
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,980
I got anything to help Phoebe be not dead in there.

163
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,920
Oh, did you feel that?

164
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,000
What happened?

165
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,000

166
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,800
I did.

167
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,720
I got smacked.

168
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,060
There's a repair hammer.

169
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,360
I'm okay.

170
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,000
I will.

171
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,780
I'm as okay as I can be, I guess.

172
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,900
Here, Phoebe, take a load off.

173
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,780
Take a load off.

174
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,820
I like how it's off.

176
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
on the grill.

177
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
Wait, wait, there's an EpiPen!

178
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,820
Wait, Phoebe, I can revive you!

179
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,100

180
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,860
How did you get in?

181
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,700
Oh, thank you.

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,970
There's one more out here.

187
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,290
Okay, let's take it with us.

188
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,190
We will take it with us.

189
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,250
Yeah, someone grab it.

190
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,110
This one, this one.

191
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,810
Oh, let's bring the ball to it.

192
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:28,930
I got it.

193
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,510
We definitely need to bring the bays.

194
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,230
Hello?

195
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:33,690
Over.

196
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,370
Relax and increase.

197
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,130
Hello?

198
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,250
Can you hear me?

199
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:39,590
Yes.

200
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,430
Yeah, I can hear you.

201
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:41,490
Yes.

202
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,910
Talk with the, try the walkie-talkie.

203
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,510
Talk with this.

204
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,910
What is the walkie-talkie?

205
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,570
Right here, right there.

206
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,750
Talk with that.

207
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,530
With this.

208
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:51,990
Okay.

209
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:52,990
Hello.

210
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,830
Can you hear me?

211
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,310
Can you hear me?

212
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,170
Over.

213
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:55,890
Over.

214
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,410
Yeah.

215
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,110
It makes your voice sound funny.

216
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,090
Oh, wait!

217
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,750
Hello?

218
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,310
Over?

219
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,090
Wait, no.

220
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,690
I'm afraid of taking it under right.

221
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,130
Hello?

222
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,490
Over.

223
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,850
I'll put it under water.

224
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,990
I'm not a friend.

225
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,310
Hello?

226
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:09,790
Over?

227
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,530
Can you hear me?

228
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:10,890
Over?

229
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,390
How do I sound over?

230
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,750
Over?

231
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,730
Okay, I can hear you over.

232
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,510
I think I am electrocuted over.

233
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,170
You want to electrocute it?

234
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:29,370
Over?

235
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,190
No, I'm just kidding.

236
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,430
Oh, wait.

237
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,010
Phoebe, after your raw ham incident...

238
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,830
Have you got a broken bone?

239
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,670
I think my bones are broken.

240
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,130
Oh, me too, yeah.

241
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,110
Oh, nice.

242
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:45,630
Okay.

243
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,610
We have actually broken bones.

244
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,670
We have broken bones.

245
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,410
Wait, how did that break our bone?

246
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,890
Yeah, it was fine.

247
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:55,910
How do we do that?

248
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,770
Oh, there's a manual.

249
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,590
Wait, should we read this?

250
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,390
Sure.

251
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,050
Yeah, maybe.

252
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,550
Reading.

253
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,210
Oh.

254
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,010
What's it say?

255
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,190
Oh...

256
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,290
Oh, there's a lot that you have to do in this game.

257
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,150
Oh!

258
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,500
Oh...

259
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,580
Um, here you go.

260
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,800
Someone else can read it.

261
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,460
Be all prepared.

262
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,520
What's this saying?

263
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,900
Oh, I'll do it.

264
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,360
I don't know if you're busy throwing bears at me.

265
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,430
What does this say, Phoebe?

266
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:46,870
Okay.

267
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,450
So there's a winch on the front and on the back of the car.

268
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:53,650
A winch!

269
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,430
Oh, I found it!

270
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,030
I got it!

271
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,910
I got the winch!

272
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,770
I got the winch!

273
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,630
Oh, winch.

274
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,290
The winch.

275
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,130
The winch.

276
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,090
And then you can use it to put a stake in the ground and
stay there.

277
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,850
Aw, dang it.

278
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,230
You can repair things.

279
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,950
You have to repair things.

280
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,930
What did you just do?

281
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,330
Nothing?

282
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,570
How far can it go?

283
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,710
The wedge!

284
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,470
Yo!

285
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,750
Let's go!

286
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,830
Oh, I thought I could, like, spring myself off it.

287
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,510
That's a shame.

288
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,790
How do you get inside?

289
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,350
Am I just too short?

290
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,350
You jump, isn't it?

291
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,190
Oh, yeah.

292
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,810
I mean, you guys are kind of short.

293
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,270
Oh, I got in.

294
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,010
Let's go.

295
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,670
Oh, you did it!

296
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,130
Yay!

297
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,170
Um, let's see.

298
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,510
I guess I'm on a leash now.

299
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,370
That's our pet, Phoebe Chan Cheebe.

300
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,490
Yeah, little dog Phoebe.

301
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,170
If we start driving, we'll get dragged behind the car.

302
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,050
I wonder.

303
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,210
Let's try it out.

304
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,730
I was like, I don't know if I'm curious enough, but you know
what?

305
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,710
We can try it out.

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,270
Oh, there's a cool car.

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,280
Oh my god.

371
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
What did you guys do?

372
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,020
You guys, I was not here for this.

373
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,380
Okay, yeah, you're right.

374
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,040
You were with me.

375
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,480
Vicky, what did you do?

376
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,580
I don't know.

377
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,460
Our grill.

378
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,740
Are the windows smashed?

379
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,700
No.

380
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,880
I've never seen the world so diagonally Oh, oopsie.

381
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,980
Okay, hold up.

382
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,660
We appear to have trees in the ceiling.

383
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,000
That's not going to cause it to set on fire, is it?

384
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,460
You know, let a load off.

385
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,100
There you go.

386
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,680
Have a beer.

387
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,760
That'll solve all the problems.

388
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,380
Okay, hold on.

389
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,700
Wait, can't we push it if we drink the beer?

390
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,820
That's what the manual said.

391
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,540
Oh, really?

392
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:58,940
Oh, yeah.

393
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
Wait, I'm pushing the car.

394
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm pushing it.

395
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,760
I think I'm super human.

396
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,480
Let's go.

397
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:04,960
Have a beer.

398
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,800
This is denser to power.

399
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,140
How are you pushing it?

400
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,480
You just press F.

401
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,660
How do I pick up this beer?

402
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:15,880
Okay.

403
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,820
Pick up.

404
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,240
Okay.

405
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,000
Chug, chug beer.

406
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:19,820
Chug beer.

407
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,500
Chug beer.

408
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,040
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

409
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,140
Oh, oh, oh, here we go.

410
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,860
Nice, nice, nice.

411
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,500
Wait, how do you push?

412
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,840
F.

413
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:30,920
F.

414
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,920
Oh, nice, nice.

415
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,440
A, A, A, A, ah!

416
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,020
Hey, hey, hey!

417
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,700
Should we decide what direction we want to push it in?

418
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

419
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:54,720
Are we all pushing it in different- Yeah, I think- This is
how we save Akiba with our superpowers.

420
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah.

421
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,780
We're gonna save Akiba.

422
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,880
I think the winch round may be like- Oh.

423
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,240
Maybe if you like attach it to something.

424
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,850
Hold on.

425
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,340
Yeah, maybe.

426
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:08,700
Yeah.

427
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,600
I'm gonna attach it to Phoebe.

428
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,560
Where should I attach it?

429
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,420
Okay, Phoebe, come here.

430
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,460
You're gonna pull it home.

431
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,740
I can't move.

432
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,160
Wait, reset winch.

433
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:18,880
Okay, hold on.

434
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,100
Where did I put it on?

435
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,960
Wait, does the beard in general make me stronger?

436
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,840
I don't know.

437
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,120
I might need another beard.

438
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Wait, how do I get inside?

439
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,700
I reset the winch first.

440
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,220
Reset.

441
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,600
How do I reset it?

442
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,600
How do I get inside?

443
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,860
Hold on.

451
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,160
It was your first time driving manual.

452
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,340
I think I did pretty good for my first time driving.

453

Yeah.

I wasn't there to see how this happened, but I'm sure you
were just fine.

00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,380
Wait.

456
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,200
This is not your fault at all.

457
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,540
There was a goblin on the road and you tried to avoid
hitting him.

458
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,080
Yeah, exactly.

459

Flipatronic 2000 pickup attached to shelf.

I'm gonna floor it.

478
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,700
You're gonna floor it?

479
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,400
Okay, floor it.

Okay, floor it, floor it.

482
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,620
I'm gonna switch to two because that's a higher number.

483
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,260
I couldn't work out how to switch.

484
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,360
Am I in park or no?

Oh, wait, here.

490
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,980
You're reverse, reverse.

491
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,320
Nothing's happening.

492
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm gonna also push it.

493
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,760
I'm gonna go to five.

494
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,380

I'm gonna try one.

498
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,760
Chat says start in one and as you get faster shift to two,
apparently.

499
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,380
Whatever that means.

500
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,300
We're not even, we don't even have speed, dude.

501
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,980
This is zero miles per hour, my god.

502
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,880
I could try and like wait down the bottom of the truck with
my ass.

503
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,900
You know what?

504
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,280
Maybe if you keep pushing and I reverse at the same time.

505
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,560
Okay, let me get another beer.

506
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:54,900
Which way?

507
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,620
Out of the trees.

Yeah, okay.

509
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,120

Okay.

511
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,060
Push and I reverse.

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,560
Okay, okay.

513
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,740
Well, real quick, can you throw me a beer?

514
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,020

00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,740
All right, Vicky.

531
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,620
All right.

532
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,400
That was crisp.

533
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,060
Oh, I heard that.

534
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:35,900
Satisfied.

Alright, we are.

538
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,620
We have so much super strength.

539
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,200
So much.

540
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,200

Go.

551
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,020
Oh my god, that was nearly it.

552
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,040
Oh!

553
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,520
Oh!

We might have to.

658
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,600
I think so.

659
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,740
I think we have to make it so that the tires go on top of
the...

660
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,040
Oh.

661
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,820

663
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,140
There are woodplants.

664
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,500
There are lots of woodplants.

665
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,320

Oh, no.

669
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,940
The road's closed.

670
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,980
The road's closed.

671
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,420
Wait, what was this one?

672
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,060
What does it say?

673
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,380
I thought there was another.

674
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,760
Due to cave in the road is closed.

675
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,180
Yeah.

676
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,260
What does that mean?

677
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,060
Surely there's always a cave in the...

678
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,880
What do you mean?

679
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,920
We could just...

680
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,800
Yeah, it's just a little dark, but we have lights.

681
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,560
Yeah, it's fine.

682
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,800

Oh, I find more.

684
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,660
I'm not really sure I'm helping.

685
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,860
Yeah, I think I'm better off looking for wood.

686
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,940
Where is there more?

687
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,440

I'm up on this hill, guys, and you will find the wood.

Did you just say, oh, Lordy?

734
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,290
You guys, there's houses here.

735
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,350
We don't need to go anywhere.

736
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,650
Oh, uh...

737
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,410
Let's go burgle them.

738
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,210
What?

739
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,670
I mean...

740
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,730
Yeah, I'm stealing their scrap.

741
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:33,230
Whoa!

742
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:33,710
Ah!

743
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:34,550
Ah!

744
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,130
Ah!

745
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:35,790
Ah!

746
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:35,850
Ah!

747
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:35,970
Ah!

748
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:36,630
Are you okay?

749
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:37,230
Are you okay?

750
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,190
That's not a stick!

751
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:41,790
Ah!

752
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,590
Oh my god!

753
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,690
Wait, can we eat it?

754
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,750
Can we eat it?

755
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,430
No?

756
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,910
Oh, it's out!

757
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,690
What the hell?

758
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,270
Is she dead?

759
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,970
Oh, I got the antidote!

760
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,210
I got the antidote!

761
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,110
Oh, watch out.

762
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,270
Thanks, guys.

763
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,410
Wait, can you take...

764
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,530
Oh, I'm... I don't... Wait.

765
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,570
Let's see if there's a weapon around here, maybe.

766
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,710
I got some bear spray.

767
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,690
Maybe that'll work.

768
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,170
Oh, maybe.

769
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,130
Oh, my God.

770
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,490
There's snakes in the house everywhere.

771
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,670
I got some lotion.

772
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,250
Yeah, we need to be the snake eaters, guys.

773
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,350
Yeah.

774
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:32,750
That almost just gets snaked again.

775
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,590
The rain.

776
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,190
And someday we'll put snake on the grill.

777
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,530
Snakes on a plane.

778
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,630
I'm gonna eat a tree frog.

779
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,370
I'm sorry, I really like that line.

780
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,610
Guys, chainsaws!

781
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,110
Oh, no, it's scrap metal, never mind.

782
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:50,550
Oh, where?

783
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,190
Oh, dang, dang.

784
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,130
Round the back.

785
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,390
Why don't they move, though?

786
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:56,850
Like, once they...

787
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,550
Oh, they do kind of...

788
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,810
They switch a little bit.

789
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,150
No, they dance.

790
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,190
They booty dance.

791
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,990
So much good stuff in the house.

792
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:05,790
There's, like, beard.

793
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,670
We have nothing to scare them off with.

794
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,230
I'll get in there.

795
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,310
I'll get in there.

796
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,970
Can we just push him?

797
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,030
Right, I'm going to try and push one.

798
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,890
Okay, I'm inside.

799
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,510
There's nothing in here.

800
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,270
You're inside?

801
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:16,830
Yeah.

802
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,970
Oh, there's hats and stuff in here.

803
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,830
Wait, where's the beer?

804
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,990
You said there was beer in here.

805
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,230
I saw it in the other one.

806
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:28,810
What?

807
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,450
Oh, I put one inside of the RV.

808
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,850
Oh, okay.

809
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,470
Okay, nice.

810
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,350
We do.

811
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,010
Okay.

812
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:39,650
Wait, what's in here?

813
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,770
See if we can repair our roof.

814
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:42,890
No.

815
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,050
Why do you want to do that?

816
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,650
You know what?

817
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,770
Yeah, maybe it's fine.

818
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:49,870
It's fine with it.

819
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,470
Oh, you know what?

820
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,990
I think we need some burgers.

821
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,450
That's what I think we need.

822
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:54,150
Hey!

823
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:55,690
We got another grill.

824
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,130
I think that would heal my poison.

825
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,250
Yeah, how do I use it?

826
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,030
I think you just turn it on, no?

827
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,070
Closeable grill.

828
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,590
Oh, so you got that?

829
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,650
Wait, who's poison?

830
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,370
How do you use it?

831
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,650
Just turn it on, Vicky.

832
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,950
I am poisoned.

833
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,710
Oh, I took the antidote.

834
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:10,330
I'm fine.

835
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:10,810
Fire up.

836
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:11,510
Nice.

837
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:12,850
Ooh, fire up.

838
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,430
Nice.

839
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,890
Nice.

840
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,110
Nice.

841
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,260
Hey, it's cooking.

842
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,500
Who wants the first meat patty?

843
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,360
I can deal with being 80% poison.

844
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,600
I think it's fine.

845
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,220
We should save the antidote.

846
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,880
Whoa, whoa, it just popped into a burger.

847
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,460
Whoa, it just became a burger.

848
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,980
Oh my God.

849
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,480
Wait, I want to see the burger.

850
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,880
Wait, Phoebe became a burger?

851
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah, yeah, just come here.

852
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,680
Yeah, you just, you just take one of the meat patties and
then you put it on the grill.

853
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,220
Yeah.

854
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:42,840
Put it on here.

855
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,300
Watch this.

856
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,020
It's magic.

857
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,860
It's like popcorn.

858
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,460
Oh, my love.

859
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,800
Oh,

860
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,840
yeah, yeah, let me see.

861
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,540
I can kick and ban you.

862
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,920
I'll just up the whole game.

863
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,020
Arigato.

864
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,060
Yeah.

865
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,000
Loss.

866
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,440
Buns and all.

867
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,360
Buns and all.

868
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:16,940
This is awesome.

869
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,040
Mmm, an okay burger is the soft burger.

870
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,820
Oh, there's different burgers, guys.

871
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,800
Oh, there's different types.

872
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,220
Oh, wait, can I also become a burger?

873
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,420
What a flavor you like.

874
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,820
What a grill.

875
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:33,800
What a grill.

876
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,800
Here, hold on.

877
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,300
Try it.

All right.

She's hot.

883
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,520
It's like a hot stone sauna, but cheap version.

884
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:46,940

00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:02,770
Oh, okay.

916
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,770
Okay, so that's how you do it.

917
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,920
Oh, yeah!

918
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,260
Run into the sign.

919
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:12,880
Run into the...

920
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,040
Oh.

921
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:14,980
When I...

922
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,820
Oh, not bad.

923
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,460
When I did drive, I always needed to use a pillow to see
over the wheel.

924
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,360
And I feel like this that is the case here.

925
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,700
You're good.

926
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,560
Just go straight.

927
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,180
Go straight.

928
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,800
Oh, a little to the left.

929
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,660
Yeah, go straight.

930
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,540
You're good.

931
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,600
A little to the right.

932
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,400
A little to the right.

933
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,920
You're good.

934
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,300
Doing great.

935
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,480
Straight, straight.

936
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,040
You're good.

937
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:35,840
You're good.

938
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,440
And then we can...

939
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:38,660
Oh.

940
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,540
I think you need to go to two.

941
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:41,900
I don't know.

942
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,900
It just started.

943
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,880
Howdy partner.

944
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,640
Oh, we weren't ready for three yet.

945
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,740
Nah, I think we're good in one.

946
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,060
Okay.

947
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,560
I'm in two.

948
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,900
Oh, there's a house!

949
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,840
Citizenship!

950
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,320
Oh, that's not a house.

951
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,300
Oh, it is a house.

952
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,320
Wait, what's that?

953
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,990
How do I get out of the driver's...

954
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:09,890
A rocket launcher!

955
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:10,950
Scrap metal.

956
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,570
A rocket launcher?

957
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,070
No, I was wrong, sorry.

958
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,890
Maybe you can use it on the snake.

959
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,350
We got some more beer.

960
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,350
Another EpiPen.

961
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,390
I feel like we...

962
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,130
Oh, antidote, sorry.

963
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:24,370
I feel like we definitely need that.

964
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,310
We definitely need that.

965
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,230
Anyone who's poisoned, use the antidote.

966
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:31,910
What is this?

967
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,910
motor oil.

968
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,370
Gregor doesn't seem to be here anymore.

969
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:41,690
Yeah, is there some kind of like underlying plot as to why
nobody's here?

970
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:43,410
The snakes.

971
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:44,070
The snakes.

972
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:45,690
A little jingle.

973
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:47,610
Oh yeah, what's happening?

974
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,090
Who's talking?

975
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,810
Is there, is there lore?

976
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,110
Away, away.

977
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,650
Away, away, away, away.

978
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:05,370
Oh, A wimboe.

979
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,170
A wimboe.

980
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,150
A wimboe.

981
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,950
Where I teach you how to choose.

982
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,770
Absolute calm.

983
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,250
Now I know what you're thinking.

984
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,050
Austin.

985
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,190
What is this even coming from?

986
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,530
The radio, I think.

987
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,790
Maybe we stole someone, some guy's mixtape or something.

988
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,150
Maybe.

989
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:21,850
Maybe.

990
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:22,550
That sounds nice and all.

991
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,310
Well, it's not very good mixtape.

992
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,730
I don't have time for it.

993
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,470
Where's the mix?

994
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,770
Hey, girl.

995
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,630
Hey, girl.

996
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,630
I made your mixtape.

997
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:31,010
Whee.

998
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,050
Whee.

999
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,330
Whee.

1000
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:34,670
Oh.

1001
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,490
Are you also scouting where we're going?

1002
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:39,970
Yeah.

1003
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,990
I guess there's a road there.

1004
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,370
Yeah, like kind of...

1005
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,010
Oh, more scrap metal.

1006
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:46,410
Oh, really?

1007
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:47,050
Just kind of...

1008
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,290
Oh, there's stuff in the trees.

1009
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,230
I got burgers!

1010
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:50,570
And bear spray.

1011
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:51,450
Burgers!

1012
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,090
Burgers in the trees?

1013
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,570
I don't know if I trust that, Minto.

1014
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,730
No, this is fine.

1015
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:56,230
This is fine.

1016
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:57,750
Are you sure?

1017
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:58,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1018
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,930
This is the good stuff.

1019
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,550
This will make some fine grade...

1020
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:13,430
probably been out for a few days but all right no no the
burgers where the bears put it just here just now the bears

00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,930

1024
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:36,590
I don't know.

1025
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,210
It doesn't feel like...

1026
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,070
Do I smell nice?

1027
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,090
Do I...

1028
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:40,930
Do I...

1029
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:41,170
Hmm.

1030
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:42,730
Smells like beer and cigarettes.

1031
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,950
Ooh.

1032
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,630
It's working.

1033
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:47,530
Wait, is...

1034
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:50,730
I feel like a bear spray would be tangy like lime, no?

1035
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,130
Can I give a little taste?

1036
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,150
Just a little bit.

1038
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:57,650
No.

1039
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:02,150
What?

1040
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,030
Where are you going?

1041
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,310
Where are you going?

1042
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:19,010
Well, it did say do not for consumption on the bottle.

1043
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,950
It does probably say that.

1044
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,130
Oh dear.

1045
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,210
It's anti-bear spray.

1046
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:33,190
Oh, here I was thinking it was gonna make bears be my
friend.

1047
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,550
Wait, where'd you guys go?

1048
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,530
Oh my god.

1049
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,190
We'll pick you up.

1050
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,870
I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up.

1051
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,070
I'm getting lost.

1052
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,470
Oh, I'm ready for you.

1053
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:48,470
Vicky!

1054
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,850
Vicky!

1055
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,370
Vicky!

1056
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:51,910
Vicky!

1057
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,490
You snooze, you lose!

1058
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,150
You snooze, you lose!

1059
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,710
Thank you.

1060
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,850
I think I'm...

1061
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,650
Are you just holding me in the windscreen?

1062
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:05,070
Yeah.

1063
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,870
I'm not complaining.

1064
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,910
You're so small!

1065
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,230
One minute!

1066
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:19,190
Maybe we should have our little, our little, you know, mini
TV in the RV break.

1067
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,390
Yeah, okay.

1068
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,810
Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right.

1069
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:23,870
Although we might go off an edge.

1070
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,910
Okay, no, no, no, good parking, good parking.

1071
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,110
Okay, cool.

1072
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:29,670
What's happening?

1073
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:30,250
What?

1074
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:30,690
What?

1075
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,930
Angle bear!

1076
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:34,450
Angle bear!

1077
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,450
What's happening?

1078
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,130
What's happening?

1079
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:39,610
What's happening?

1080
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,090
What's happening?

1081
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:42,770
Oh, it's a bear!

1082
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,210
The bear is here!

1083
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,530
It's a bear!

1084
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:47,130
It's a bear!

1085
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,350
It's a bear!

1086
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:50,910
We

1087
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,140
need to repair the car while we were getting attacked.

1088
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,880
Oh, but we reached a checkpoint.

1089
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:05,640
It's fine.

1090
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,580
That's why there was the bear spray.

1091
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,180
Okay.

1092
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,160
Well.

1093
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,800
Talking of bears, you know what other creatures are scary
and might attack you?

1094
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,700
Crocodiles!

1095
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:19,660
Crocodiles!

1096
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:21,440
Yes!

1097
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,060
Yeah!

1098
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,920
We're gonna watch a crocodile!

1099
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,880
Wait, can I switch to Discord talk?

1100
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,680
Because I won't be able to hear you guys after.

1101
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,780
Yes.

Wait.

1109
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,200

Oh my god, I just had to turn it down.

1136

Oh, it's pretty.

1144
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,040
It's so cute.

1145
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:11,860
It's pretty.

1146
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,840
Oh, it's pretty.

1147
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,220
I love his style.

1148
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,960
Yeah, I like the style.

1149
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,000
I like how it's like very like watercolor-y kind of.

1150
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,820
It's really nice.

1151
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,600
This guy is...

1152
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,920
His hat, he needs it.

1153
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,360
He needs it.

1154
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:41,980
It's necessary.

1155
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,120
It's a pretty good hat, to be fair.

1156
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,180
He is.

1157
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,300
He won't be Monkey D.

1158
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,660
Luffy without it.

1159
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,160
King of the Pirates.

1160
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,560
This is like the worst idea ever.

1161
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,640
This is...

1162
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,120
Why do I feel like we'll be doing this in the game?

1163
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:01,700
Oh?

1164
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:04,860
Oh?

1165
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:05,420
Oh?

1166
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:05,580
Yeah!

1167
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,560
Oh my gosh.

1168
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,720
I want that to happen to me.

1169
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,320
Get jaws.

1170
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,640
Wait, I'm turning off the subtitles.

1171
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,560
Oh, he's getting burgled.

1172
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,000
No!

1173
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,120
Oh no, he had a rifle.

1174
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,240
back at home.

1175
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,500
The animation is so good.

1176
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:27,920
Wow!

1177
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:29,360
It is so good.

1178
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,760
Oh, he's freaking dead!

1179
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:34,840
Cute!

1180
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:35,900
Oh!

1181
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,480
Boy, you never seen a worm with a cigarette dance to Jingle
Bell Rock?

1182
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,740
Now this is a GUI stream, yes!

1183
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:45,520
What?

1184
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,020
Oh, we just see him!

1185
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,170
Oh!

1186
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,150
See you, see you!

1187
01:00:59,410 --> 01:00:59,430
Oh!

1188
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,120
Here's what I say to them.

1189
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,340
Tier 3 Discord?

1190
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,580
This is such a cute way.

1191
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,500
Cut your girlfriend too.

1192
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,700
Listen, I'm a milky girl.

1193
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:11,540
Yeah.

1194
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,980
This is so cute.

1195
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:14,720
Wow.

1196
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:15,800
Wow.

1197
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:29,470
Computer barn.

1198
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:30,630
Nice.

1199
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,730
That's where I get all my stuff to.

1200
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,070
Where will she plug it in?

1201
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,290
At a computer barn.

1202
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:38,850
Burgle the barn.

1203
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:39,670
Burgle the barn.

1204
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,210
The animal control!

1205
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,220
The animation is so good!

1206
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,380
So nice.

1207
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,960
I hope she got her RAM before it became expensive.

1208
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,300
The gamer keyboard.

1209
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,340
The RGBs.

1210
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:10,700
Wow.

1211
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,120
Oh, that was so good.

1212
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,320
That was so good.

1213
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,930
That was so cute.

1214
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,450
So wow.

1215
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:36,170
Oh my gosh, I am so, so excited to see what kinds of content
Kairou makes.

1216
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,950
Beasties, Beasties, Beasties, Beasties love.

1217
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,750
Beasties, love.

1218
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,110
I'm going to show you guys.

1219
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:47,770
I know you're okay.

1220
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,220
I don't, I watched this.

1221
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:55,620
Oh, this is, I'm on the Densetsu account.

1222
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,820
These are, these are the, I was like, what is happening?

1223
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,820
to the recommendations.

1224
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,720
I want to see the recommends.

1225
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,800
Wait, what does it look like?

1226
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,060
It's like this musical, an anime musical, and then an old
man's advice.

1227
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:24,410
I was like, oh, I wonder what a little show for my
recommended, but then, and like, it's just old man.

1228
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,400
Steiner?

1229
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,200
What is he watching?

1230
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,160
Anyway!

1231
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:34,960
Yay!

1232
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,340
Sorry.

1233
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,000
But that was a good little intermission, everybody.

1234
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,180
It was.

1235
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,160
It was.

1236
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:47,820
She has a...

1237
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,760
She has a... What's it called now, though?

1238
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,540
A waiting room up.

1239
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,680
Oh, did you guys already mute?

1240
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:57,040

01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:03,600
I don't know.

1245
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,320
I didn't check.

1246
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,960
Wait, hold on, I'm going to look.

1247
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:08,460
Kairu Krakato.

Oh, there.

1249
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,000

We even played Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1267
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,720
The game was not letting us turn off the in-game audio.

1268
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,300
So that's why we stick to the in-game audio.

1269
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:18,960
And then you can play...

1270
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:19,980

01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,300
Minto, I can't hear you.

1283
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:34,940
Can you unmute?

1284
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,600
Oh, oh, let me unmute.

1285
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,040
Yeah, for go on.

1286
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:38,900
Yeah, sorry.

1287
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:39,700
So game was beat.

1288
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,260
Uh, there we go.

1289
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,380
They're just me in game, but not Mint.

1290
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,280
So Mint has to be on Discord.

1291
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:48,880
Yeah.

1292
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,220
But then I have to turn Mint's Discord volume down for
myself.

1293
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,040
But then she has to be unmuted for Vicky.

1294
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:54,820
It's very cool.

1295
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,020
Yeah, we were struggling with the audio.

1296
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,240
We were trying to get it to turn off in game, but it
wouldn't.

1297
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,420
So then if we had it in Discord, it was going to be doubled.

1298
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:12,240
we were talking in discord and then we could only hear two
people at a time it was very scuffed so we were trying to

1299
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:23,280
figure it out beforehand yeah it's all good now though all
right how about whoever loses rock paper scissors has to try

Wait, oh no.

1306
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:08,940
It's RNG.

1307
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,700
It's RNG.

1308
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:11,720
What items do you get?

1309
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:12,320
No!

1310
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,280
That just means...

1311
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:15,020
Really?

1312
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:19,440
We have to just drive fast enough for the bear to not get
us, I guess.

1313
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,180
I think so.

1314
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:20,580
Okay.

1315
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,680

I don't drink caffeine.

1333
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,540
Don't have to ask me twice.

1334
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,860
We can push the bear.

1335
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,660
Maybe wait till we get near the bear.

1336
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,540
Have your beer in your hand and then we can push the bear
away.

1337
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,080
I'll have one in my hand.

We're going?

1351
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,860
It's just like a roller coaster.

1353
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:58,640

Look out for bear.

1356
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,280
We have one of those little scented things in the car too.

01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,720
Makes it smell nice.

1358

01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,280
It's a Christmas tree.

01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,780
It's probably Christmas flavor.

1361
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,520

1456
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:09,700
Is it?

1457
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,400
How many epi pens do you guys have?

1458
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,280
I've got loads of scrap.

1459
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,520
How do you see your inventory?

1460
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,140
Oh, I think, okay, I guess it is shared then, because mine
says six.

1461
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,800
Mine says six as well.

1462
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:22,520
Oh, okay, okay.

1463
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,540
Where do you see that?

1464
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,020
Oh, six.

1465
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:25,780
Okay, it is shared.

1466
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,040
Yeah, yeah, it's at the top.

1467
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,480
Am I still robot?

1468
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,700
Nope, you're good.

1469
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,640
Oh, wow.

1470
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,200
Thanks.

1471
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,440
Do I want to get in the van, though.

1472
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,860
Oh, we could go in through the top.

1473
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,320
Yeah, going in through the ladder.

1474
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,660
What's the power hole?

1475
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,680
What's that?

1476
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,640
Where's the ladder?

1477
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,720
Going in.

1478
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,280
Where is the ladder?

1479
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,020
Yeah.

1480
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,740
Maybe, um...

1481
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,780
Did we lose it?

1482
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,580
We might have.

1483
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,780
How have all of...

1484
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,960
How have we been sleeping?

1485
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,840
Oh, you can go in via the tree.

1486
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,900
I can pick up anybody that would like to come in.

1487
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:20,540
in oh we also in in the van oh oh you're behind me thank you
girl they're right behind me aren't they i guess i also

1488
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,620
could have driven us a

1489
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:38,310
we're fine everything's good oh yeah we're good oh yeah we
are now where are we i think the thing on the top is to flip

1490
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,970
the rv if it flips over

1491
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,450
Wait, where are we?

1492
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:45,550
Are we good?

1493
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:47,930
Um, I don't see a path.

1494
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,610
I think we might get out in one.

1495
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:51,170
Yeah, I'm gonna park here.

1496
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:55,870
It's a little precarious, but don't worry about it.

1497
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:59,750
Um, oh, that is a cliff we are about to drive onto.

1498
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:00,530

01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:46,920
Yeah, yeah, just stay there.

1521
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,140
There's gotta be a way to get down here.

1522
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,860
Yeah, there is, there is, there is.

1523
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:57,720
Potentially, like, it's steep, but, uh...

1524
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,760
There ain't no mountain I can't climb.

1525
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,200
If it goes up, it must come down.

1526
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,880
Kills baby's there.

1527
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,160
I need no...

1528
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,880

1533
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:19,820

1534
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,460

There we go.

1541
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,620
Is it getting darker or is it just me?

1542
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,220
Alright, there's one other cliff we gotta go down.

1543

01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:29,830

It's my trauma!

1583
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,060
I can't stop jerk.

1584
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,660
She's jorking him.

1585
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,600
She can't stop.

1586
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,760
It's the only thing that can make me feel something.

1587
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,360
It's the only way I can feel anything.

1588
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,260
Just lay down in the bed to get some nice rest.

1589
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:50,520
Oh.

1590
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,160
Val's still being jorked in the back.

1591
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,260
Wait, wait, I know.

1592
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,800

Hold on, hold on.

1597
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,460

01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,660
It was so close.

1629
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,920
We're gonna have to winch it.

1630
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:04,960
Oh, we have to winch it.

1631
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,700
How about I try and jump in there?

1632
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,380
Do you think that'll work?

1633
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,540
Okay, go, go, go.

1634
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1635
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,360
That was sick!

1636
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,500
Oh my god!

1637
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,380
Let's go.

1638
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:22,380
Let's see.

1639
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:25,300
Um, what should we winch to where?

1640
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,200
Yeah, to where?

1641
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,360
Whom?

1642
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:30,640
What?

1643
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:33,780
Whom?

1644
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:34,560
Okay.

1645
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:35,840
I winched!

1646
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,720
Okay, you winched.

1647
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:39,920
Okay.

1648
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:41,360
Should I drive?

1649
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,000
Yeah, use the controller to pull.

1650
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,060
Controller.

1651
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,380
Okay.

1652
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:48,320
Okay.

1653
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,680
Ah, I'm gonna close the door.

1654
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,060
There you go.

1655
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,400
Um, Vicky, could you turn to the left as I do this?

1656
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,500
Thank you.

1657
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,340
Just turn the wheel to the left as we do this.

1658
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:11,480
Turn the wheel.

1659
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:13,820
Oh, turn the wheel.

1660
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:15,420
Yeah.

1661
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,300
Yeah, good job.

1662
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,260
That is left, right.

1663
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:18,380
Okay, that's left.

1664
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,040
That's coming for me.

1665
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:22,720
Nice.

1666
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,420
You can do it, Vicky.

1667
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,120
Nice.

1668
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:25,520
Nice.

1669
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,000
Okay, you don't have to turn anymore.

1670
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:27,540
We're good.

1671
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,020
We're good.

1672
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,220
Uh, cool.

1673
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:31,920
I can make it.

1674
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,760
I can make it.

1675
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,440
I'm a stinking goat.

1676
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,220
What am I?

1677
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:35,820
Yeah.

1678
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:36,900
I can run up walls.

1679
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:37,820
It's pretty good.

1680
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,200
Whoa.

1681
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:44,340
Must have fives of steel run up that steep.

1682
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:44,940
Yeah.

1683
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,520
Okay, now I'm going to attach it to a tree up.

1684
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:47,980
It's up there.

1685
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:49,920
Okay.

1686
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:51,560
Wait.

1687
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,240
Do I need to do...

1688
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,300
Tell me if I need to do it.

1689
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:55,120
Should I turn right?

1690
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:56,440
Wait.

1691
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:57,420
I can't move.

1692
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,140
Why could I move before and now I cannot move?

1693
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,860
Wait, can you turn it off?

1694
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,940
Actually, can you turn off the winch?

1695
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,640
Oh, Terry reset the winch?

1696
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:10,060
Don't...

1697
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,620
I don't think you need to reset it.

1698
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,900
I think you just need to turn it off.

1699
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,000
Turn it off.

1700
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:15,220
Oh.

1701
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:16,700
How we do that?

1702
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,840
Maybe you do need to reset.

1703
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:19,860
I don't know.

1704
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,620
I'm just gonna reset it.

1705
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:25,980
Yeah, reset it.

1706
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:26,600
Okay.

1707
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,020
Okay, okay, okay.

1708
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,900
I'm attaching to a tree.

1709
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:32,460
You can do it.

1710
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:32,680
You can do it.

1711
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,080

01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,740
Yeah, just a little bit.

1811
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,380
Because we're on the, we are very close to the edge.

1812
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,080
Oh!

1813
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:56,080
You know, if we, if you can turn, like, if we can turn it
this way somehow.

1814
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,240
Like that way?

1815
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,980
Yeah, that's what I was trying, but it wouldn't budge at
all.

1816
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:01,440
Hmm

1817
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,920
Oh, that's why I'm not backing up.

1818
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:07,920
Okay.

1819
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:08,360
Hmm.

1820
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:17,000
Yeah, guys, um We might have to reach the hot.

1821
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1822
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1823
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,720
Oh, oh my god, we're fine.

1824
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,680
Oh, oh, oh.

1825
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,400
I'm driving to the right.

1826
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,560
but it keeps pushing me over here.

1827
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,640
It keeps pushing you there.

1828
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,420
Yeah, for some reason.

1829
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:36,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1830
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,120
Okay, okay, good.

1831
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:40,680
And then, yeah, I guess keep going to the right a little
bit.

1832
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,000
Maybe that's counteract it trying to make you go to the
left.

1833
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,480
No, it's still making me.

1834
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,140
Let me drink a beer.

1835
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:48,800
I'm going to drink a beer.

1836
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,240
Push me!

1837
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,180
Where are beers?

1838
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,480
Do we have any more beers?

1839
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:54,240
Yeah, go, baby, go.

1840
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:54,960
Where are the beer?

1841
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,300
Oh, there.

1842
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,700
Underneath the table.

1843
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:57,300
Okay.

1844
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,120
I'm taking the six pack.

1845
01:29:59,300 --> 01:29:59,900
I'm taking the six pack.

1846
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,160
Sorry!

1847
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,520
Sorry, so sorry.

1848
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,280
Wait, but doesn't this put us back at the bridge?

1849
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:14,440
That's where we died the first time.

1850
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:14,980
Yay!

1851
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,280
Oh, that was good!

1852
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,080
That would save us so much time!

1853
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:20,720
You know?

1854
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,740
Maybe we won't fall off the bridge this time.

1855
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,800
I think somebody else should drive over the bridge.

1856
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:26,980
There's a bear spray, guys!

1857
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:28,160
There is?

1858
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,200
Oh, nice, nice!

1859
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:29,760

Oh, thank God.

Oh, nice.

1862
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,040
Okay, maybe the bear will come this time.

1863
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:37,380
Oh, and burgers!

1864
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,120
Yeah!

1865
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:42,360
Oh, my gosh, we should have done this ages ago.

The winch.

1989
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:06,030
The winch.

1990
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:06,550
The winch.

1991
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:07,970
Oh god.

1992
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:10,210
Okay.

1993
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:13,870
Okay, you can do...

1994
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:15,310
Vicky, you have the controller.

1995
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:16,590
You have the controller.

1996
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:18,490
Guys.

1997
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:20,030
Yeah.

1998
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:20,730
Yeah.

1999
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:21,890
Yeah.

2000
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:23,130
Yeah.

2001
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:25,330
I can get in.

2002
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:26,590
Look out of the bad.

2003
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:27,530
Look out of the bad.

2004
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:29,550
and then down and that's all there.

2005
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,550
We're fine.

2006
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:36,050
Oh, I'll leave you down there.

2007
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:36,390
Shoot.

2008
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:41,330
Phoebe's head is blocking it on the screen.

2009
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,990
I exited out of the door straight off the bridge.

2010
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:43,750
It's okay.

2011
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:44,690
I'm inside.

2012
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,410
I'm inside.

2013
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,610
Oh, you are too.

2014
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:47,090
You're inside?

2015
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:47,990
Yeah, I'm inside.

01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:49,010

In my defense, there's burgers down here, so you'll get some
burgers as well.

2038
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:55,270
Oh, there's like a little prickle behind you.

2039
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:57,330
Oh, oh, I see.

2040
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,410

I don't know.

01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,050
You shouldn't have told me that

2045
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:13,030
Can you drop me right in front of me?

2046
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:17,050
I can see them Oh, no, I can see someone.

2047
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:17,690
It's me.

01:38:18,190 --> 01:38:21,710
Thank you for coming to save me Drop I can't go down
anymore.

2049
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:23,150
I can't go down anymore.

2050
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:27,210
Oh, shoot Okay, I'm gonna try backing up the car a little
bit.

2054
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:37,090
I'll try to be careful.

2055
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:38,550
Can you see me?

2056
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:39,950
Oh, my Lord.

2057
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:42,310
You look majestic.

2058
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:45,510
You look like a beautiful bird flying on the wind.

2059
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:46,790
She was a fairy.

2060
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:49,370
A fairy.

2061
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:50,710
A fairy.

2062
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,050
Did it help at all?

2063
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:53,670
Did it back you up a little bit?

2064
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:55,450
No, but I might be able to...

2065
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:57,810
I might be able to let go and then climb up.

2066
01:38:57,930 --> 01:38:58,690
I'm gonna try that.

2067
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:00,730
And then you...

2068
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,590
So just leave the winch here, okay?

2069
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:04,970
Oh, God.

2070
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:05,650
Okay.

2071
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:07,130
Okay, here I go.

2072
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:08,130
And don't be careful.

2073
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:09,910
Okay.

2074
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:12,070
Oh, wait.

2075
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:12,610
Oh?

2076
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:13,710
Where am I going?

2077
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:15,050
Wait, oh, I have to drop it.

2078
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:16,070
Oh.

2079
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:17,930
Wait, if I drop it, does it retract?

2080
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:20,250
Drop the base.

2081
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,430
Okay, it stays.

2082
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:25,010
It stays.

2083
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:27,070
Don't reset the winch.

2084
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:28,770
Don't re- Oh, nice.

2085
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:29,270
Okay.

2086
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:34,470
There's some buggies over there too if you want them.

2087
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:36,970
Wait, wait!

2088
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:37,930
Me!

2089
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:40,330
What is happening?

2090
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:51,760
Uh, well, bad news is karma might have just karma.

2091
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:59,120
I cannot see, I cannot see over the cliff.

2092
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:01,380
What is, what is going on down there?

2093
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,920
Chat, you're gonna have to describe it to me.

2094
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,700
Oh, I could have just...

2095
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:08,940
Hi, baby.

2096
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:12,120
Call yourself Burgers.exe.

2097
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,440
Oh, hi, you guys.

2098
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:14,180
Whoops.

2099
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,280
Well, welcome back.

2100
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,180
Do the- What?

2101
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,660
Just drop the burgers again.

2102
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:36,100
Karma is a sweet thing, don't you think, everyone?

2103
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,640
What?

2104
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:39,660
What?

2105
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:43,720
You know what?

2106
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:43,940
You know what?

2107
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:44,660
I just realized.

2108
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:45,580
I could have just...

2109
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:47,060
I could have just revived you.

2110
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,900
I could have just revived.

2111
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:49,340
Yeah!

2112
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,240
Exactly!

2113
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:52,940
Come on, Minto.

2114
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,640
Yeah, make the right choice.

2115
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,520
Oh, there's lotion down here too.

2116
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:57,600
I suppose I'll forgive you.

2117
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:58,660
Wait, there's more burgers.

2118
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,220
What's over here?

2119
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,820
No, you dropped the burgers.

2120
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,760
I saw them drop from above, Minto.

2121
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:04,860
It's the same burgers.

2122
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,700
It's the karma.

2123
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:10,990
Okay, come this way.

2124
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:11,610
Come this way.

2125
01:41:12,770 --> 01:41:13,130
Okay.

2126
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:13,570
Me?

2127
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:14,790
No, no, no.

2128
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:15,430
I'm talking to...

2129
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:16,170
Yeah, Vicky, Vicky.

2130
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:17,290
Okay.

2131
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:19,950
I'm still just going to wait for you guys.

2132
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:22,690
I was going to come back for you.

2133
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:26,670
Yeah, sure you were, sure you were.

2134
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:28,190
Oh, we're close to the ocean.

2135
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,710
Beware the spikies.

2136
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:37,310
Spikies?

2137
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:38,070
Yeah, these.

2138
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,350
These bad boys.

2139
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:40,330
Yeah.

2140
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:41,010
Oh, yeah, okay.

2141
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:44,250
It was pretty hilarious when I saw the burgers drop down.

2142
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:45,590
Oh, welcome back.

2143
01:41:46,610 --> 01:41:48,510
Oh, thanks, Vee-Vee!

2144
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:52,570
Yay, welcome back, Vicky!

2145
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:53,850
We're back!

2146
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:57,370
And we have burgers, so it was all worth it in the end,
wasn't it, guys?

2147
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:59,730
Oh, we need to repair it real bad, don't we?

2148
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,270
How can I not get up?

2149
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:03,210
Okay.

2150
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:04,590
I'm going to repair.

2151
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:08,190
Why can't I repair?

2152
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:09,730
There's the bear still just on the bridge.

2153
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:10,630
I doubt it, right?

2154
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:12,010
I think we knocked the bear off.

2155
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:13,510
He ran away.

2156
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:14,650
I think Phoebe drove over him.

2157
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:15,570
He ran away.

2158
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,130
No, I think Phoebe drove over him.

2159
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:18,790
No, I definitely saw him run away.

2160
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:20,150
Oh, okay.

2161
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:23,010
I'm going to get ahead a little bit.

2162
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:25,190
I think I was hitting someone.

2163
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:30,930
Like, could you sit and so proper?

2164
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:33,730
Aw, straight and so proper.

2165
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,310
What happened?

2166
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:35,250
What the heck?

2167
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:36,530
Let's see, I'm an eye and I'm sideways.

2168
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:39,190
You good, Phoebe?

2169
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:43,210
For some reason, I went fully to the left when I tried to go
straight.

2170
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:44,730
Oh, no.

2171
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:45,850
Oh, Phoebe.

2172
01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:46,950
Oh, Phoebe.

2173
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:48,430
Oh, Phoebe.

2174
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:49,850
Oh, Phoebe.

2175
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,370
What happened?

2176
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:52,030
Oh, I'm winging it.

2177
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:52,930
I'm winging it.

2178
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:53,490
Oh.

2179
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:55,950
Oh, Phoebe.

2180
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,690
Oh, oh, I see.

2181
01:42:58,630 --> 01:42:59,950
Oh, I see.

2182
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:01,010
Oh, that is a rock.

2183
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:01,950
That is a massive...

2184
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,310
Yeah, that's a rock.

2185
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:05,650
That's a rock.

2186
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:06,990
That's a rock.

2187
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:09,110
Oh, wait, hold on.

2188
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:09,750
How do I do this?

2189
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:11,570
Oh, wait, we can reset it, right?

2190
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:14,070
Okay, there we go.

2191
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:15,590
Okay, we use the back winch.

2192
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:16,350
That's what I'm doing.

2193
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:17,370
Can we just pull backwards?

2194
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:18,450
Okay.

2195
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:20,650
Then I'll get rid of the front winch.

2196
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:21,350
I'm on it.

2197
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:22,030
I'm on it.

2198
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:26,010
Which one is it?

2199
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:27,250
Can I do anything?

2200
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,250
You're so short.

2201
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:31,910
You are helping.

2202
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:33,890
I will be motivation.

2203
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:35,450
Yeah, get it.

2204
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:36,810
Yes, get it, girls.

2205
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:37,470
Yes.

2206
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:38,910
Work it.

2207
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:39,890
Get that wench.

2208
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:40,350
Yeah.

2209
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:42,150
You can do it.

2210
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,490
Is there any way you could push?

2211
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:47,090
Me.

2212
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:48,050
Push which way?

2213
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:48,870
From the front?

2214
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:49,470
Yeah.

2215
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:50,430
Yeah, let me get some beer.

2216
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:52,190
Can you chop me a beer, Phoebe?

2217
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:54,230
Yeah.

2218
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:56,550
Is it out or in?

2219
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,710
Which one is it?

2220
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:00,010
Thank you.

2221
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:00,690
Yes.

2222
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:01,250
Right.

2223
01:44:01,630 --> 01:44:02,770
Push from this side, right?

2224
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:03,750
Yeah, right.

2225
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:05,150
I'm gonna trug and push.

2226
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:09,270
Or wait, maybe we go forward instead because the rock is too
big.

2227
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:10,570
Yeah.

2228
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:11,830
Perhaps.

2229
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:12,970
Maybe.

2230
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:14,710
Hold on, I'll reset this.

2231
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:17,130
I think it seems to be doing something.

2232
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:19,350
Is that helping?

2233
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:20,230
We are going backward.

2234
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:21,070
Oh, you are.

2235
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:21,850
Wait, you are.

2236
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:23,070
Wait, let me do it again then.

2237
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:23,810
Oh, wow.

2238
01:44:23,850 --> 01:44:24,410
Okay, hold on.

2239
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:25,870
I'm going to keep going reverse then.

2240
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:28,330
Oh, I don't think the reverse will do anything.

2241
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:33,420
Where did I put the remote?

2242
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:33,800
Oh, there.

2243
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:37,720
Oh, wait.

2244
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:42,320
Is it working?

2245
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:44,260
Kind of, yeah.

2246
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:50,040

Woo-hoo!

2249
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,560
Do you need me to drive backwards or forwards or anything?

2250
01:44:56,660 --> 01:45:00,420
Well, we gotta keep going this way, so I don't know how you

Let's go.

2307
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:21,940
Let's go.

2308
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:22,400
Ay.

2309
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,040
Ay, ay, ay.

So, okay, so this is the way we're supposed to go up here,

01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:30,680
Which way?

2312
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:31,180
Up.

2313
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:32,200
Yeah, I think so.

2314
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2315
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,280
Where did we come from?

2316
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,660
Yeah, you're supposed to go that way.

2317
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:36,060
Yep.

2318
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:37,280
Okay.

2319
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,240
Okay, what kind of what kind of what kind of?

2320
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:39,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2321
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:43,020
Nice.

2322
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,340
Good job, everybody.

2323
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:45,400
Good job, Phoebe.

2324
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:46,560
You got this?

2325
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:47,520
Woo-hoo!

2326
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:48,780
Thank you.

2327
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,340
I'll try.

2328
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,160
You could go in the circle again.

2329
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,340
You could just go back down where you...

2330
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:53,920
I could go in the circle again?

2331
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:55,760
Yeah, if you drive up.

2332
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:58,200
And you could just go to the left.

2333
01:48:59,020 --> 01:48:59,300
Yeah.

2334
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:00,600
Maybe.

2335
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:02,860
Maybe.

2336
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:05,440
Yeah, circle around.

2337
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,220
Can you go to the left?

2338
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:06,820
Go to the left?

2339
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:07,280
Yeah, yeah.

2340
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,300
And then...

2341
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,040
And then to the...

2342
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:11,820
and then to the right.

2343
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:13,620
Yeah.

2344
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:15,280
Yeah.

2345
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:16,580
Okay, we got some burgers in the meantime.

2346
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:17,100
Oh my god.

2347
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:17,800
Okay.

2348
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:18,860

Come here.

2350
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,820
Okay, don't roll me over.

2351
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,480
Alright, we're back in business, baby.

2352
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:27,620

2355
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:37,590
Okay, there's another bridge.

2356
01:49:38,150 --> 01:49:39,430
Oh, short people problems.

01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,290

The burger's just...

2360
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:45,170
Fell out the van, I think.

2361
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:45,730
Oh, no, don't worry.

2362
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:46,050
They're here.

2363
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:47,350
You park.

2364
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:49,050
With the thing going for me.

2365
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:51,050
And then reverse.

2366
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:52,870
You want me to line you up?

2367
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:54,770
Yeah.

2368
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:56,370

01:50:09,650 --> 01:50:10,450
Pull forward.

2377
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:10,890
Should I just pull forward?

2378
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:11,390
Yeah.

2379
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:12,590

You're good.

2399
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:37,250
You're good.

2400
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:37,570
Wow.

2401
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:38,690
You're good.

2402
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:39,770
You're good.

2403
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:41,150
Oh, wow.

Oh, man.

Get back up there.

2407
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:48,390
Keep going?

2408
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:49,050
That was terrifying.

2409
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:50,750
That was so terrifying.

2410
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:55,610
Yeah, baby!

2411
01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:57,330
Woohoo!

01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:03,600
Keep going straight.

2414
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:04,580
Okay.

All right.

You guys think we're going the right way?

01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:11,400
Sure.

2418
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:13,420

01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:55,200
Oh, Lord.

01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:57,560

Yeah, yeah, you're good, you're good.

2485
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:10,420
Should I just go down now?

2486
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,280
Yeah, just go down.

2487
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,580
Just go down, just go down.

2488
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:13,120
Okay.

2489
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:16,960
It's scary, it's scary, it's scary, it's scary.

2490
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:19,400
I see something down there.

2491
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:21,740
You do, what do you see?

2492
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,480
I see it with your special eyes.

2493
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:28,820
I see it, I think, um, I see sexy ladies.

2494
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:29,880
They're calling for me.

2495
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,500
I must go to the void.

2496
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:33,640
Wow, we might go.

2497
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,320
Oh my gosh, we must go!

2498
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,940
Wait, this part's pretty easy, though.

2499
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,460
We'll chase after those sexy ladies.

2500
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:40,120
Oh, yeah.

2501
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:40,640
Yeah.

2502
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:42,840
In, in, in!

2503
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:45,980
Here we go.

2504
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:46,680
Oh.

2505
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:49,120
I'll catch up.

2506
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:49,460
Are you in?

2507
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:49,900
Nope.

2508
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,240
You need to go to the left a tiny bit.

2509
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,180
A tiny bit left.

2510
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:55,300
There's a sexy babe at the top.

2511
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:56,820
Yeah, sexy babe at the top.

2512
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:57,440
There we go.

2513
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:57,880
There we go.

2514
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:58,340
Nice.

2515
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:58,660
Okay.

2516
01:54:59,040 --> 01:54:59,300
All right.

2517
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:00,760
Sexy babe at the top.

2518
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:02,880
It's our wives.

2519
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:03,780
They're waiting for us.

2520
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:04,280
at home.

2521
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,700
Oh wait, what is this all here?

2522
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:06,300
Yeah!

2523
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,980
Oh, that's a lot of junk.

2524
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,860
Yeah, there's a lot of junk here, for real.

2525
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:12,720
Oh, wow.

2526
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:13,600
What is all this?

2527
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:14,540
Go get some of this stuff.

2528
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:15,660
A ramp?

2529
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:16,600
What is a ramp?

2530
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:17,880
Oh, a winch pole.

2531
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:18,580
That's kind of worrying.

2532
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:19,960
Winch pole.

2533
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,100
Why do we need all this stuff?

2534
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,100
I'm kind of concerned.

2535
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:23,960
Oh, we got some oil.

2536
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:24,960
What's the oil for?

2537
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:27,760
I thought epi pens were good idea.

2538
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:28,600
Yeah.

2539
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:30,660
Yeah, I picked up some motor oil before.

2540
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,560
I don't know what it's for.

2541
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,200
Sorry.

2542
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:39,240
Attached.

2543
01:55:39,460 --> 01:55:41,260
Do we like run out of petrol at some point?

2544
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:42,460
I don't know.

2545
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:43,460
Oh wait.

2546
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:45,480
Let's put that in.

2547
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,440
Or sorry, run out of gas.

2548
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,420
We got the gate.

2549
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,420
Maybe we have to change our oil.

2550
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:56,360
Maybe.

2551
01:55:56,860 --> 01:55:58,840
The engine's under the bed, apparently.

2552
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:00,220
Let's have a look.

2553
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,640
Is that what the blue is?

2554
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,540
On the top?

2555
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:09,780
Will that fix that?

2556
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,260
The engine's here under the bed.

2557
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,640
I don't know when we need to refill it, though.

2558
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:17,660
Yeah, when, but what?

2559
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:18,580
Tell us?

2560
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:18,940
Whoa.

2561
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:19,320
Here's an ear.

2562
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2563
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:22,040
Whoa.

2564
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:23,440
Whoa.

2565
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:23,540
Whoa.

2566
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:27,300
It repairs the engine.

2567
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:28,740
That's the red damage.

2568
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,080
Now, huh?

2569
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:31,240
Ah, the red damage.

2570
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:34,740
Where's our ladder?

2571
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:37,580
Oh, wait, we already have a wheel.

2572
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:43,750
Yeah, I want to...

2573
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:47,570
Oh, my bad.

2574
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,160
Should I just leave one of these in here?

2575
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:56,260
They're huge.

2576
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:57,680
Right.

2577
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:01,060
Yeah, I was trying to find this so I could...

2578
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:06,540
There we go.

2579
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:07,680
Disgusting.

2580
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,160
Oh, you have to...

2581
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:12,300
Wait, is that really what you have to do?

2582
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,020
do.

2583
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:15,400
There's all these wooden planks.

2584
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:17,420
Oh, there's so many wooden planks.

2585
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,160
Wait, we have more ramps and stuff.

2586
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:19,980
We have more ramps.

2587
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,180
Oh, there's so much scrap around here.

2588
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:23,720
There's so much stuff.

2589
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,720
I found another epi pan.

2590
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:25,100
Yeah.

2591
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,060
Use the things.

2592
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:26,680
Beers.

2593
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:27,700
What?

2594
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,120
This is like... We're not the only people.

2595
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,240
How many have died before that?

2596
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:32,120
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna say.

2597
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,460
We're not the only one stuck out here.

2598
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:34,600
Yeah.

2599
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:37,540
Boy, it's the lore in this game.

2600
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:38,320
Yeah.

2601
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:39,680
If there is some.

2602
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:41,440
All right.

2603
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,300
I like this.

2604
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:53,200
placement of the ramp oh yeah yeah it's good we we have to
drive over that oh my god what we have to just drive through

2605
01:57:53,200 --> 01:58:06,220
these rocks how's that gonna work oh what where the heck are
we meant to drive in here i don't know i think you follow

2606
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:17,820
the obstacle yeah you like follow the rocks around this way
like the path continues here so you have to make a full turn

2607
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:28,800
oh drop we have to drive over them rocks i guess that's why
we're being given ramps where does the path continue i can't

2608
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:37,640
even i wish there were pings in this turn like over here i
know i wish we'd ping look here uh i'm jumping i don't see

2609
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:49,540
you oh there i see you yeah um it's like this way oh yeah so
we basically are making a big ue around now yeah oh my god

2610
01:58:49,540 --> 01:59:05,540
whoa that's so hard oh there's more scrap over here nice
nice nice i don't go too far yeah i might meet a bear i know

2611
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:15,060
i have a beef with that guy i need to settle yeah we need to
show him who's boss One beef.

2612
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,800
One beef.

2613
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:21,280
I have one beef to serve.

2614
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,560
I have exactly one beef patty with the bear.

2615
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:25,720
Oh wait, people are saying use the winch.

2616
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:27,220
It would be so easy if we did.

2617
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,020
Oh really?

2618
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,500
Which we, you have all these winch poles.

2619
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,320
We have all these winch poles.

2620
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,520
We just can we like take a shortcut and winch ourselves up?

2621
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:38,440
I think so.

2622
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:38,920
No.

2623
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:44,240
We just placed the pole like right here and then we put the
winch.

2624
01:59:44,260 --> 02:00:05,900
and then we pull ourselves over get it pull we wench pull
ourselves over oh no who do okay wait where am I I just see

2625
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:16,400
rocks everywhere guys where's the van oh there you are okay
okay I'm putting this down I'm putting these poles down or

2626
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:27,140
the planks down Okay So that we can get you over the big
rocks Do we want to set up some ramps as well At the bits

2627
02:00:27,140 --> 02:00:28,000
that are a bit tricky?

2628
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:32,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, that would be good Where do you think would
be nice?

2629
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:36,500
Maybe here?

2630
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:49,780
You can't really position the ramp, though It doesn't turn
the way that you want to Try to put it down Is it tricky?

2631
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:51,240
To be honest, it's quite small.

2632
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:52,280
Will it even be helpful?

2633
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:55,860
Oh, Phoebe.exe.

2634
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:56,280

02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:13,440
Oh, we're off.

2643
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,400

I got it.

2651
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:50,860
I'll come push you.

2652
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:51,240
Yeah.

2653
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:53,460
Chug-a-chug-a, babies.

2654
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:58,260
I've got something to do now.

2655
02:02:06,790 --> 02:02:07,010
Yeah!

2656
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:07,810
Oh!

2657
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:08,490
I'm coming.

2658
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:10,650
Uh...

2659
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:11,790
Now wrench us.

2660
02:02:12,570 --> 02:02:13,010
Huh?

2661
02:02:13,690 --> 02:02:15,090
Okay, I'm gonna...

2662
02:02:16,230 --> 02:02:16,710
Um...

2663
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:20,050
I'm gonna use the wrench control.

2664
02:02:20,050 --> 02:02:21,150
No, I think you should...

2665
02:02:21,150 --> 02:02:22,390
I think you should drive forward.

2666
02:02:22,390 --> 02:02:25,290
That is 45 degrees.

2667
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:27,330
Yeah, I think you should drive forward.

2668
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,310
Okay.

2669
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:29,970
Yeah.

2670
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:31,610
Is that

2671
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:39,540
all right?

2672
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:40,100
Yeah.

2673
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:42,660
Oh, wait a second.

2674
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:44,480
Oh, wait a second.

2675
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:45,600
Do I need to push?

2676
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,680
Oh, wait a second.

2677
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:51,880
That is an angle, isn't it?

2678
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:55,940
I think if we get underneath the...

2679
02:02:55,940 --> 02:02:58,120
I think we can get under the tires and push.

2680
02:02:58,700 --> 02:02:59,140
Oh, no.

2681
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:08,540
and push okay let me have that bit oh my god what an angle
okay i'm gonna also i don't think so i don't think so vicky

2682
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:11,340
i might wait here oh oh

2683
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:41,930
the road yeah we skipped so much of it we did oh my god
shortcut oh whoa big brain guys we're pros we are pros do we

2684
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:48,370
need anything here oh which poles are one time used by the
way oh they are oh you're Right!

2685
02:03:49,330 --> 02:03:51,890
Okay, well, it was good in this situation.

2686
02:03:52,110 --> 02:03:52,530
It worked.

2687
02:03:53,190 --> 02:03:55,710
Did we take the other ones and put them in the van or?

2688
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:56,690
I don't think so.

2689
02:03:56,850 --> 02:03:58,230
I think we should do that.

2690
02:03:58,370 --> 02:03:59,250
Should I go grab them?

2691
02:03:59,430 --> 02:04:00,450
Yeah, I'll help too.

2692
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:01,330
They're over here.

2693
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,850
They're in the van.

2694
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:02,250
They're right here.

2695
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:03,190
There's one here.

2696
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:04,010
There's one here still.

2697
02:04:04,810 --> 02:04:05,310
Oh, there's one?

2698
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:06,630
Yeah, I got it.

2699
02:04:07,090 --> 02:04:07,330
Okay.

2700
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:09,050
The ramps are also in the van.

2701
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:11,790
I think we might need the ramps for the...

2702
02:04:11,790 --> 02:04:14,030
Do you think the ramps are one-time use or no?

2703
02:04:15,870 --> 02:04:17,630
No, I think I put them down.

2704
02:04:17,970 --> 02:04:28,550
as far as i know okay but they're they're blooming massive
do we need them they're well annoying i think we can use it

2705
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:37,950
here though like i think it would be good for this part
because okay right i'll try it yeah i think so let's try it

2706
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:42,750
i mean to be honest either way i just want them out of the
van they're taking up far too much space okay i'm gonna drop

2707
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:49,070

it Does that even do anything?

2708
02:04:49,310 --> 02:04:50,250
It's really hard to position them.

2709
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:50,650
I know.

2710
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:54,030
How's that one?

2711
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:55,290
It's really bad.

2712
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:57,530
I'm gonna get out and see where exactly we're gonna go.

2713
02:04:57,550 --> 02:04:59,570
I don't think they stack.

2714
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:04,190
I mean, you could try.

2715
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:08,610
Okay, I see where we're supposed to go.

2716
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:09,250
Yeah?

2717
02:05:09,370 --> 02:05:09,930
This way.

2718
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:10,790
Hold on.

2719
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:11,530

They're nice.

2733
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:46,430
They're veggie crisps.

2734
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:49,390
Yeah.

2735
02:06:49,930 --> 02:06:50,770
That's so good.

2736
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:52,890
Where are we sideways?

2737
02:06:53,130 --> 02:06:54,490
Oh, I see where you're going.

2738
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:55,750
Oh, ah.

2739
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:56,770
The vision.

2740
02:06:58,410 --> 02:06:59,550
I thought we were going up.

2741
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:01,790
I do think that's where we're supposed to go.

2742
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:04,730
Because there's a whole path down that way.

2743
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:07,110
Oh, I thought we were going up where the wench was.

2744
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:07,490
No, honey?

2745
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:08,910
Yeah, I thought so, too.

2746
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:11,330
Wait, do we want to put down some planks, though?

2747
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:12,350
Let me put some planks.

2748
02:07:13,370 --> 02:07:14,590
It could be this way, though.

2749
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:15,850
Let me have a look what's up this way.

2750
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:17,070
Uh-huh.

2751
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:21,190
All right, don't go until I'm done with all the planks.

2752
02:07:22,490 --> 02:07:22,810
Okay.

2753
02:07:22,910 --> 02:07:29,030
I think this is the way, actually, because this is the way
to the construction site thing.

2754
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:30,470
Yeah, I think that is probably the way.

2755
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:33,310
Then we'll have to move the cranes somehow.

2756
02:07:33,570 --> 02:07:34,890
Just ain't that the way?

2757
02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:36,610
The, wait, the crane?

2758
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:38,890
The cranes, yeah.

2759
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:39,870
Wait, there's cranes.

2760
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:41,990
The cranes.

2761
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:43,050
The cranes.

2762
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:47,090
Do I mean big... I could mean beautiful birds.

2763
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:49,370
Yeah, that's what I think you means.

2764
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:50,310
Yeah.

2765
02:07:51,290 --> 02:07:54,070
I've always wanted to go see them in Hokkaido.

2766
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:55,430
Ooh.

2767
02:07:56,430 --> 02:07:58,590
Do you think this is gonna work like this?

2768
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:01,630
I feel good.

2769
02:08:02,130 --> 02:08:02,190
Yeah.

2770
02:08:02,190 --> 02:08:03,050
Yeah, why not?

2771
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:05,310
Like that?

2772
02:08:06,510 --> 02:08:08,890
I'm just a little worried about this guy as well.

2773
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:10,850
But we might be okay this way.

2774
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:30,610
If you try going to the right, a bit yeah I believe guilty
oh you are genius oh you are so genius yeah I'm an engineer

2775
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:47,770
women in STEM oh my gosh guys women in STEM yeah good job

don't brew the wind disagreed yeah so there's like I think

2777
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,540
we will do that right now.

2778
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:20,600
I'm gonna make a windshield for us.

2779
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:23,340
Oh, that's why I went through.

2780
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,240
Okay, go ahead.

2781
02:09:24,620 --> 02:09:24,960

That was my head.

2785
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,360
Yeah, that was my head.

2786
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:29,920
Oh, damn.

2787
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,540
Your head does not need fixing.

2788
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:34,620
You are genius.

2789
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:36,560
Wait, can't we just go around?

2790
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:39,540
There's a gas station up ahead too.

2791
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:41,180
Can't we just go?

2792
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:43,860
There's like a cliff on the, that's right in front of us.

2793
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:44,900
Why do we need to go down?

2794
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:49,140
Ah, soca, soca, what to keep going this way?

2795

Wait, where are we going?

2797
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:53,760
Yeah, yeah, we don't even need to go down the cranes.

02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:55,520
Yeah, you don't need to go to the cranes, no?

Because there might be some stuff down here.

With the cranes.

Holy cow.

How do we even get the RV up here, though?

2867
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:25,480
Um, I think we have to go around, probably.

2868
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:26,220
Right?

2869
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:27,300
Uh, right?

2870
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:32,440
I mean, if we really tried to see if we could get it up this
route.

2871
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:39,620
I was thinking that I did not want to entertain the idea.

2872
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:45,320
We may have limits, but maybe we can push past those limits.

2873
02:14:46,820 --> 02:14:49,340
Oh, look, a beer station and burgers.

2874
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:50,400
Yeah.

2875
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:51,380
There's so much.

2876
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:51,940
Oops, ouch.

2877
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:55,480
I'm gonna put in the fucking team, the third cassette.

2878
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:57,240
I'm gonna bring it to the RVM.

2879
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:58,060
Yeah, yeah.

2880
02:14:58,400 --> 02:14:58,700
Yay.

2881
02:14:59,540 --> 02:14:59,960
Let me see.

2882
02:14:59,980 --> 02:15:02,160
I'm gonna look at the map real quick and see it.

2883
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:02,480
It feels important.

2884
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:02,960
Okay.

2885
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:04,300
If maybe.

2886
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:14,810
I don't...

2887
02:15:14,810 --> 02:15:15,110
Eh?

2888
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:15,630
Eh?

2889
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:19,420
Eh?

2890
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,260
I don't know.

2891
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:21,820
Where are you, Snakey?

2892
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:23,980
I can hear you.

2893
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,960
The ugly baller by Archibald.

2894
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:28,200
What?

2895
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:33,760
It was a dewy morning on Sunspark Isle when all the ballers
came out to play.

2896
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:34,940
All the ballers!

2897
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:36,340
We've all been over-slept.

2898
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:38,600
They were missing out on all the fun.

2899
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:40,680
Again?

2900
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:43,860
They quickly shook off their drowsiness and raced out into
the field.

2901
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:45,080
Raced out into the field.

2902
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:47,500
They cried out in excitement to their fellow ballers.

2903
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:54,400
But instead of welcoming Fluffington the third they all
jeered at them oh don't have no idea why the others were

2904
02:15:54,400 --> 02:16:01,080
mocking them it was only yesterday that they were all
playing together after all distraught friedon the third

2905
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:07,840
trotted over to a nearby lake to drink some water oh no as
fluffington the third lent over they caught a glimpse of

2906
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:13,360
their reflection oh yeah they noticed once again that they
don't look like the others.

2907
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:19,960
Fluffington the third always found it strange that they were
always fluffier and a different color to the other ballers.

2908
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:24,920
Not to mention that they had four legs instead of two and no
hands.

2909
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:25,940
Oh Fluffington.

2910
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:33,480
They felt the gentle headpats of their Wrangler companion
which as always melted away all of Fluffington the third's

2911
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:34,300
sad feelings.

2912
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,220
That's so sweet.

2913
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:37,920
Hey yeah Fluffington the third began the Wrangler.

2914
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,860
Wait it is just the British part and all the Americans.

2915
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,260
It's definitely get you.

2916
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:44,920
Rangloon began shearing the wool off Fluffington.

2917
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:51,820
Fluffington III wondered why the Rangloon never did this to
the other boulders, but it always felt nice to Fluffington

2918
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,220
III.

2919
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:54,160
Okay, Fluffington III.

2920
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:55,640
Go play with the others now.

2921
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,740
I feel like I'm missing some context here.

2922
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:00,220
Yeah, really?

2923
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:02,880
Fluffington III returned to the other boulders.

2924
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:08,620
At first, they looked at Fluffington III curiously, unsure
of where their wiry fur went.

2925
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:15,540
But then, they kicked Fluffington III of all, and they all
began happily playing together again the moral of the story

2926
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:32,880
cut your hair leave what oh okay where are you guys cut your

No, not in the game.

Why is it acting like this?

3045
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:22,410

02:28:54,670 --> 02:28:55,130
The ground?

Wait, can we make some burgers so we can heal?

3153
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:52,250
Yes.

3154
02:29:53,550 --> 02:29:55,270
I'm firing up the grill.

3155
02:29:55,670 --> 02:29:56,910
Almost all my bones are broken.

3156
02:29:57,790 --> 02:30:00,150
And there's some burger patties here.

3157
02:30:00,250 --> 02:30:00,770
Woohoo!

3158
02:30:01,150 --> 02:30:02,630
Wait, how do I drop?

3159
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:03,350
How do I put it on?

3160
02:30:04,230 --> 02:30:05,330
Oh, just like that.

3161
02:30:05,350 --> 02:30:05,890
He's rescued.

3162
02:30:07,890 --> 02:30:10,510
So do burgers out in the open encourage bears?

3163
02:30:10,690 --> 02:30:12,250
Or I mean, let's face that one.

3164
02:30:12,810 --> 02:30:13,870
No, no.

3165
02:30:14,050 --> 02:30:14,870
Yeah, I'm sure it's fine.

3166
02:30:15,610 --> 02:30:15,750
Oh.

3167
02:30:16,690 --> 02:30:16,950
Oh.

3168
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:19,170
Oh, they're so cute.

3169
02:30:19,930 --> 02:30:20,410
I'm getting that.

3170
02:30:20,410 --> 02:30:21,550
Oh, can I have Johnny?

3171
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:22,890
Oh.

3172
02:30:23,550 --> 02:30:24,430
You can have Johnny.

3173
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:27,170
I hope this doesn't give me the shits.

3174
02:30:29,690 --> 02:30:30,350
Oh, yeah.

3175
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:32,690
Lovely, lovely.

3176
02:30:34,650 --> 02:30:35,370
Very good.

3177
02:30:35,610 --> 02:30:36,830
That actually helps so much in my health.

3178
02:30:37,250 --> 02:30:38,550
Mmm, delicious.

3179
02:30:38,830 --> 02:30:40,570
It is so cute when they pop.

3180
02:30:41,370 --> 02:30:41,910
I know.

3181
02:30:43,650 --> 02:30:43,990
Eee!

3182
02:30:44,310 --> 02:30:45,490
Oh, it's another Johnny!

3183
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:46,390
Johnny!

3184
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:47,930
Oh, you got two buns and me.

3185
02:30:48,350 --> 02:30:49,330
Two buns and me.

3186
02:30:49,390 --> 02:30:50,690
It turned into two buns and me.

3187
02:30:51,770 --> 02:30:54,670
Would anyone like two buns and me?

3188
02:30:54,750 --> 02:30:57,410
My health isn't so bad right now, so if anybody wants it.

3189
02:30:57,950 --> 02:31:00,350
I have a tiny broken bone.

3190
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:02,050
I've probably just broken like my finger or something.

3191
02:31:02,130 --> 02:31:02,730
I think I'm fine.

3192
02:31:03,450 --> 02:31:05,730
Oh, then I will have two buns in me.

3193
02:31:05,910 --> 02:31:07,010
Yeah, yeah, have it, have it.

3194
02:31:07,130 --> 02:31:08,010
What's the lotion do?

3195
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:09,110
I'm going to try it.

3196
02:31:09,790 --> 02:31:10,670
Yeah, do it.

3197
02:31:11,250 --> 02:31:12,010
What does it do?

3198
02:31:12,130 --> 02:31:13,350
They make you silky smooth?

3199
02:31:13,910 --> 02:31:14,730
I don't know.

3200
02:31:14,850 --> 02:31:15,690
How do I look?

3201
02:31:16,890 --> 02:31:18,210
You look lovely.

3202
02:31:18,810 --> 02:31:19,870
You look lovely.

3203
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:22,150
Flawless skin.

3204
02:31:22,690 --> 02:31:23,030
Really?

3205
02:31:23,250 --> 02:31:23,610
Mm-mm.

3206
02:31:24,970 --> 02:31:26,830
I'm going to repair some of this, at least.

3207
02:31:27,050 --> 02:31:29,130
But also, you already looked lovely, so...

3208
02:31:29,130 --> 02:31:29,950
I'm not quite sure.

3209
02:31:29,950 --> 02:31:32,470
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

3210
02:31:32,930 --> 02:31:37,710
Oh, we do have a bunch of scrap metal, so we may as well.

3211
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:39,990
Yeah, I was looking at her thing.

3212
02:31:40,190 --> 02:31:41,130
It wasn't looking so hot.

3213
02:31:41,230 --> 02:31:41,650
Oh, sorry.

3214
02:31:42,410 --> 02:31:43,290
Excuse me.

3215
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:44,170
Sorry, sorry.

Just got a big old head in the way, you know.

3217
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:48,470
Yeah.

3218
02:31:50,390 --> 02:31:54,450
My big, big brain, my big air is taking up a lot of space.

3219
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:57,930
I'm going to drive it into the garage.

3220
02:31:59,070 --> 02:31:59,850
Nice idea.

3221
02:32:00,130 --> 02:32:02,450
Yeah, I think we can go for some other repairs.

3222
02:32:03,370 --> 02:32:13,830

02:33:53,970 --> 02:33:55,190
For real, for real.

3243
02:33:55,210 --> 02:33:56,170
Not quite sure.

3244
02:33:56,590 --> 02:33:57,750
But that was before.

3245
02:33:58,870 --> 02:34:00,070
Put it inside.

3246
02:34:00,270 --> 02:34:01,430
There's an upstairs!

3247
02:34:03,950 --> 02:34:05,130
Wait, really?

3248
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:06,310
Oh wait, that's our bus.

3249
02:34:06,690 --> 02:34:08,170
I keep calling it computer board.

3250
02:34:11,510 --> 02:34:15,930
Well, it's not really an upstairs, but I've made it an
upstairs.

3251
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:17,010
Ah.

3252
02:34:18,970 --> 02:34:20,450
It's called a roof.

3253
02:34:20,650 --> 02:34:21,090
Shut up!

3254
02:34:21,230 --> 02:34:21,950

3257
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:27,970
I mean, what is the room that's not in upstairs?

3258
02:34:30,190 --> 02:34:30,610
Yeah!

3259
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:32,450
Wait, I'm checking out the lake a little?

3260
02:34:34,890 --> 02:34:35,370
Okay.

3261
02:34:36,090 --> 02:34:38,290
I think we could scale that big rock.

3262
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:40,990
Oh.

3263
02:34:41,490 --> 02:34:41,890

Do you see it?

3265
02:34:47,310 --> 02:34:48,490
This one right here?

3266
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:51,570
Wait, where are you?

3267
02:34:51,650 --> 02:34:52,030
Oh, there you are.

3268
02:34:52,330 --> 02:34:53,910
I think it's time to climb the rock.

3269
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:55,030
Uh, pull me.

3270
02:34:55,350 --> 02:34:56,250
Come on, Phoebe.

02:35:01,310 --> 02:35:02,190
Let's do it.

3274
02:35:02,590 --> 02:35:03,490
Have you been...

3275
02:35:03,490 --> 02:35:06,630
Do you go mountain or like rock climbing or anything?

3276
02:35:07,390 --> 02:35:09,310
No, but my sister did.

3277
02:35:12,350 --> 02:35:12,790
She...

3278
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:13,210
Did she like it?

3279
02:35:13,370 --> 02:35:15,770
I know a lot of people getting into...

3280
02:35:15,770 --> 02:35:16,050
Whoa.

3281
02:35:16,990 --> 02:35:18,050
Oh, I thought there were bugs.

3282
02:35:18,210 --> 02:35:18,810
I got scared.

3283
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:21,730
Yubi!

3284
02:35:22,430 --> 02:35:23,190

02:35:29,790 --> 02:35:31,070
Yeah, I'm gonna chug these nugs.

3290
02:35:34,030 --> 02:35:37,330
Oh, it's horrible.

3291

02:35:43,770 --> 02:35:46,050

3295
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:49,650
Oh my gosh.

3297
02:35:52,750 --> 02:35:53,210

3298
02:35:53,370 --> 02:35:53,570

3299
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:53,770

3300
02:35:54,170 --> 02:35:54,930
Well, you have them then.

3301
02:35:55,070 --> 02:35:56,270
You have them.

3302
02:35:56,390 --> 02:35:58,290
Okay, well, look how cute they are.

3303
02:35:58,430 --> 02:36:00,770

Oh, the big rock!

3309
02:36:08,530 --> 02:36:08,730
The big rock?

02:36:08,810 --> 02:36:09,830
Yeah, the big rock.

3311
02:36:10,030 --> 02:36:10,990
Yeah, the fancy rock.

3312
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:11,310
Come here.

3313
02:36:11,310 --> 02:36:12,310
Two, two, a minute then.

02:36:12,470 --> 02:36:13,350
I will come there.

3315
02:36:13,650 --> 02:36:16,150
The interestingly shaped rock.

3316
02:36:16,310 --> 02:36:16,750
Yes, I'm coming.

3317
02:36:17,270 --> 02:36:17,670

3318
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:18,390
Yes.

02:36:18,450 --> 02:36:19,250
I'm going up.

3320
02:36:20,430 --> 02:36:20,630
Okay.

3321

We're going up, up, up, up, up in our moment.

3322
02:36:26,070 --> 02:36:26,810
Our moment.

3323
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:31,090
You can climb this thing?

3324
02:36:32,670 --> 02:36:32,930
What?

3325
02:36:34,030 --> 02:36:35,230
You can climb this thing?

3326
02:36:35,810 --> 02:36:36,290
I don't know.

3327
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:38,370
I was gonna try.

3328
02:36:38,610 --> 02:36:39,670
It feels like you can.

3329
02:36:40,650 --> 02:36:41,710
I don't think so.

3330
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:44,310
To an extent, maybe.

3331
02:36:46,310 --> 02:36:48,930
I mean, don't hurt to try, though.

3332
02:36:49,190 --> 02:36:50,210
Wait, who got poison?

02:38:03,540 --> 02:38:05,500
And we've been going for like a long time.

3340
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:07,900
Yeah, yeah, it's like right there.

It's also my munching by the way.

02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:10,420
That's okay.

3343
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:11,860
It's okay.

3344
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:15,160
If I had something to munch it, I'd also be munching on it.

3345
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:17,960
Yeah, also don't forget to grab these beers here.

3346
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:19,040
Whoa, yeah.

3347
02:38:19,740 --> 02:38:20,860
Oh, I grabbed a coin.

3348
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:23,080
Wait, that works too?

3349
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:23,820
I think I need that.

3350
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:24,660
Wait, did they break?

3351
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:25,560
That'd be awesome.

3352
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:27,600
I don't know.

3353
02:38:27,820 --> 02:38:29,460
Oh, what they're using their stuff in?

3354
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:30,380
Yeah, maybe.

3355
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:30,780
Maybe so.

3356
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:33,140
We could try.

3357
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:36,300
Or we could try running them over.

3358
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:37,500
I don't know if that does anything.

3359
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:38,220
Oh, ow!

3360
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:43,060
The poem is just over that mountain, apparently.

3361
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:45,860
Wait, we have more antidote inside.

3362
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:46,540

There you slept at it.

3380

I don't know.

3384
02:39:53,820 --> 02:39:53,880
I don't know.

3385
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:54,900
But where is the exit?

3386
02:39:55,900 --> 02:39:57,240
Chat, it's just over the hill.

3387
02:39:57,260 --> 02:39:57,900
Were they lying?

3388
02:39:57,920 --> 02:39:58,660
You can see how far we've come.

3389
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:00,520
Just over the hill.

3390
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:01,620
You're kind of twerking a little bit.

3391
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:06,980
too much is really hard to see the map because you're just
working it's really hard to concentrate on the map yeah

3392
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:14,440
you're just twerking it so i like can't see the map damn
okay let me put this down

3395
02:40:39,700 --> 02:40:51,680
where is this the route is that the 85 where we need to go
why are there no signs on this map.

3396
02:40:54,820 --> 02:40:56,180
We bought the cheap map.

3397
02:40:56,600 --> 02:40:58,240
It doesn't have any information on it.

3398
02:40:58,540 --> 02:40:59,340
It's a cheap escape.

3399
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:00,580
Spend all our money on beer.

3400
02:41:01,180 --> 02:41:02,220
Oh my gosh.

3401
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:04,600
I don't know.

3402
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:05,940
Red circle.

3403
02:41:06,220 --> 02:41:07,560
There is no red circle.

3404
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:10,380
There's literally no...

3405
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:10,640
This?

3406
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:11,400
Just that?

3407
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:12,280
That's...

3408
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:15,280
So we have no idea where we need to go except the circle?

3409
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:18,540
Whoa, guys.

3410
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:19,540

02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:26,610
I guess we go up the path.

3418
02:42:27,050 --> 02:42:28,250
I guess so.

3419
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,830
Up the hill.

3420
02:42:30,830 --> 02:42:31,250

02:42:40,870 --> 02:42:41,870
Where I am.

3425
02:42:42,270 --> 02:42:43,050
I will lead you the way.

3426
02:42:43,090 --> 02:42:44,870
Yeah, why are we still going backwards?

3427
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:47,590
Oh, up that way.

3428
02:42:47,710 --> 02:42:50,250
Yeah, that way, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3429
02:42:50,830 --> 02:42:52,250
Okay, come here.

3430
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:54,150
Are you inside?

3431
02:42:54,910 --> 02:42:54,930
50.

3432
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:55,730
Oh, no, you're not.

3433
02:42:56,650 --> 02:42:57,170
I'll get in.

3434
02:42:57,410 --> 02:42:57,890
Come here.

3435
02:42:58,290 --> 02:42:59,770
Exit took 65.

3436
02:43:02,750 --> 02:43:03,310
67?

3437
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:04,030
What?

3438
02:43:06,430 --> 02:43:06,910
No!

3439
02:43:07,390 --> 02:43:07,690
67?

3440
02:43:09,810 --> 02:43:10,530
Wherever you...

3441
02:43:10,530 --> 02:43:11,670
Wherever you...

3442
02:43:11,670 --> 02:43:12,030
No!

3443
02:43:12,590 --> 02:43:13,050
No!

3444
02:43:15,090 --> 02:43:16,490
It's two versus one.

3445
02:43:16,490 --> 02:43:17,610
You guys came from that one!

3446
02:43:18,230 --> 02:43:19,750
You'll become one of the last eventually.

3447
02:43:19,990 --> 02:43:20,550
I know you won't.

3448
02:43:21,090 --> 02:43:21,850
I'm like, 37!

3449
02:43:23,310 --> 02:43:25,330
Wait, why am I dead?

3450
02:43:25,850 --> 02:43:26,170
Good.

3451
02:43:27,210 --> 02:43:27,210
Karma.

3452
02:43:27,830 --> 02:43:28,770
Oh my god.

3453
02:43:29,990 --> 02:43:30,710
Where are you?

3454
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:32,030
Oh, it's the person.

3455
02:43:32,030 --> 02:43:33,730
He's going to seriously knock me out of the van for that.

3456
02:43:33,730 --> 02:43:37,150
I watched you, I watched you like fly out, but I don't.

3457
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:37,650
What happened?

3458
02:43:38,430 --> 02:43:39,390
Where are you?

3459
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:40,270
Where are you?

3460
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:41,050
I don't know.

3461
02:43:41,330 --> 02:43:41,950
In a bush.

3462
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:44,530
Wait, wait, we can go back to the revive thing.

3463
02:43:44,610 --> 02:43:45,550
We can go to the revive.

3464
02:43:46,290 --> 02:43:47,070
We can't.

3465
02:43:47,110 --> 02:43:48,390
Oh, you're so, oh my gosh.

3466
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:50,430
How did you get all the way over here?

3467
02:43:50,850 --> 02:43:51,830
I don't know.

3468
02:43:52,150 --> 02:43:53,230
With the beer either.

3469
02:43:53,310 --> 02:43:53,750
Look!

3470
02:43:54,750 --> 02:43:56,070
Look at her!

3471
02:43:58,170 --> 02:44:02,110
Never, you guys, six, seven, not even ones.

3472
02:44:02,590 --> 02:44:04,450
Yeah, I guess so.

3473
02:44:06,110 --> 02:44:09,630
This is what happens when you six, seven, unresponsibly.

3474
02:44:11,570 --> 02:44:12,130
Unresponsibly.

3475
02:44:12,410 --> 02:44:13,810
Good lesson to learn, chat.

3476
02:44:14,050 --> 02:44:15,090
Revive station.

3477
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:15,870
Revive friend.

3478
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:16,670
They put me in there.

3479
02:44:18,810 --> 02:44:19,530
They won't let me.

3480
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:20,450
They won't let me.

3481
02:44:21,230 --> 02:44:22,130
Wait, is there like a...

3482
02:44:22,130 --> 02:44:22,730
Am I still alive?

3483
02:44:23,310 --> 02:44:25,250
Oh, there's like a dead dead maybe?

3484
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:27,510
No, no?

3485
02:44:27,730 --> 02:44:28,190
Oh.

3486
02:44:29,230 --> 02:44:29,730
So...

3487
02:44:29,730 --> 02:44:31,170
Okay, remember there's a snake, guys.

3488
02:44:31,330 --> 02:44:32,750
Alright, put her in by the snake.

3489
02:44:34,390 --> 02:44:34,970
Good idea.

3490
02:44:35,070 --> 02:44:36,390
Well, you're gonna kill me!

3491
02:44:36,690 --> 02:44:38,350
Yeah, and then we revive you.

3492
02:44:39,250 --> 02:44:39,570
Okay.

3493
02:44:40,490 --> 02:44:41,770
Cool, where's the snake?

3494
02:44:41,990 --> 02:44:42,830
Oh, oh, thank you!

3495
02:44:43,090 --> 02:44:44,150
Oh my god!

3496
02:44:44,170 --> 02:44:45,830
Her body just...

3497
02:44:45,830 --> 02:44:47,850
Are you just gonna have fun killing me now?

3498
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:48,750
Why?

3499
02:44:48,970 --> 02:44:50,610
Why can't I revive you?

3500
02:44:50,610 --> 02:44:52,710
This is so cruel.

3501
02:44:53,210 --> 02:44:53,290
Oh!

3502
02:44:53,310 --> 02:44:54,090
Where is the snake?

3503
02:44:55,310 --> 02:44:55,710
Yeah.

3504
02:44:56,010 --> 02:44:56,390
So different.

3505
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:57,070
What a thrill.

3506
02:44:58,310 --> 02:44:59,110
Very different.

3507
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:02,190
With darkness and silence.

3508
02:45:02,990 --> 02:45:04,170
Throw her off the cliff.

3509
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:06,570
I mean, you might as well, guys.

3510
02:45:06,650 --> 02:45:09,330
If we're near a revive state, you might as well see how far
you can take this.

3511
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:09,890
Yeah.

3512
02:45:10,210 --> 02:45:11,510
Just throw me.

3513
02:45:11,630 --> 02:45:13,450
Wait, is there like a dead dead state?

3514
02:45:14,290 --> 02:45:16,890
Yeah, there has to be if we can't revive her right now.

3515
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:18,470
Chuck me.

3516
02:45:18,890 --> 02:45:19,090
Oh.

3517
02:45:20,370 --> 02:45:20,770
From...

3518
02:45:20,770 --> 02:45:21,210
Sayonara.

3519
02:45:21,690 --> 02:45:22,330
If you want to do it.

3520
02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:22,910
Yeah, I can do it.

3521
02:45:23,310 --> 02:45:24,030
Just do it.

3522
02:45:24,250 --> 02:45:24,410
Just do it.

3523
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:24,850
Just throw me off.

3524
02:45:25,130 --> 02:45:25,810
Shadow the hedgehog.

3525
02:45:28,390 --> 02:45:31,590
Is there anything Shadow would say before you like chuck
someone over?

3526
02:45:32,090 --> 02:45:34,850
I mean, no, it's more this is guys.

3527
02:45:34,930 --> 02:45:36,950
This is me falling off space colony arc.

3528
02:45:37,170 --> 02:45:38,050
Okay, do it.

3529
02:45:38,210 --> 02:45:38,610
Do it.

3530
02:45:38,850 --> 02:45:39,330
Sayonara.

3531
02:45:39,710 --> 02:45:41,330
Oh, Vicky!

3532
02:45:42,510 --> 02:45:42,990
Maria!

3533
02:45:49,060 --> 02:45:49,420
Why?

3534
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:50,560
She bows.

3535
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:51,200
How?

3536
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:51,860
She bows.

3537
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:53,200
You're still alive.

3538
02:45:53,440 --> 02:45:54,320
Oh my gosh.

3539
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:56,440
Well, I mean, how is Shadow alive?

3540
02:45:56,600 --> 02:45:57,840
You know, many questions.

3541
02:45:58,960 --> 02:46:01,800
You should have, you should have gone, you should have gone,
Maria.

3542
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:04,620
I did, you know what I hear me?

3543
02:46:04,700 --> 02:46:06,180
I shouted Maria as I fell.

3544
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:07,420
Oh, I didn't hear it.

3545
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:14,940
Anyway, that didn't really work.

3546
02:46:15,220 --> 02:46:18,020
So if we don't just go on EpiPen, it'll probably easier.

3547
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:19,820
Yeah, just revive or just revive.

3548
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:21,840
If you can't revive for some reason, I can't use it.

3549
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:22,960
Oh, you can't.

3550
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:23,040
I don't know.

3551
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:26,900
Maybe the, oh, I mean, don't worry.

3552
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:27,340
Oh, no, wait.

3553
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:28,280
Oh, wait.

3554
02:46:30,540 --> 02:46:33,660
Do we have it on us or is it like an item that you have to
pick up?

3555
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:34,900
No, we have it on us.

3556
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:37,200
Yeah, for some reason here.

3557
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:40,780
Like, it only gives me the option to pick her up.

3558
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:41,980
Hold on.

3559
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:42,760
Let's try.

3560
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:45,600
Maybe she's dead dead now.

3561
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:46,620
Where's the snake?

3562
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:47,280
I'm scared.

3563
02:46:47,320 --> 02:46:48,440
Yeah, guys, there's a snake.

3564
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:48,900
Careful.

3565
02:46:50,380 --> 02:46:52,240
I think he's only up towards the thing.

3566
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:53,840
I hear it, but I don't know where it is.

3567
02:46:54,200 --> 02:46:54,600
I don't know.

3568
02:46:54,620 --> 02:46:56,320
I haven't seen him around this area.

3569
02:46:56,400 --> 02:46:57,020
I think you're fine.

3570
02:46:59,020 --> 02:46:59,380
Okay.

3571
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:03,460
Thanks guys for taking my body all the way back to the van.

3572
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:04,280
Yeah, of course.

3573
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:05,460
Appreciate it.

3574
02:47:05,740 --> 02:47:06,360
What happened again?

3575
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:08,520
Oh yeah, I said it's a 7 and the van kicked me out.

3576
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:09,540
I was like, why did I die?

3577
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:10,440
Okay.

3578
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:12,420
Let's see.

3579
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:14,800

Okay.

3581
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,120
Oh no, it doesn't.

3582
02:47:19,900 --> 02:47:21,460
It only lets me pick her up, yeah.

3583
02:47:23,500 --> 02:47:24,640
Let's take her to the grave.

3584
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:26,280
We said they got three syringes.

3585
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:28,200
syringes they're just different ones

3586
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:39,520
oh wait why am i getting pulled the part of the snake if you
want are you carrying me i was carrying you carrying vicky

3587
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:53,400

bum a little bit more oh sorry oh oh oh that's gonna kill me

3588
02:47:53,400 --> 02:47:58,140
okay this again bro you could let this you could let the
snakes

3589
02:48:01,880 --> 02:48:12,160
yeah i don't know we could restart because we're at the
checkpoint we could i'm scared though what if it like puts

3590
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:16,220
the van all the way back down to the bottom or something no
just just take me in the van just put me on the bed it'll be

3591
02:48:16,220 --> 02:48:27,060
fine look guys let's be honest i'm not really helping so
just put me on the bed you are you're our moral support yeah

3592
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:34,680
it'll be okay it'll be all right do you why says we have
three should be at the repair station yeah i don't know if i

3593
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:42,260
trust it though what if it sends the van all the way back
down it would be so sad i think it probably would but we'll

3594
02:48:42,260 --> 02:48:48,420
find an epi pen we'll find one there's got to be one
somewhere soon we have three epi pens though it says we have

3597
02:49:10,730 --> 02:49:16,410
strange it's so strange it isn't a gas station you're good
to checkpoint okay apparently it is fine to checkpoint if

3598
02:49:16,410 --> 02:49:23,230
you guys want to do that um okay i'm gonna click restart
from checkpoint then i mean to be fair maybe it glitched

3599
02:49:23,230 --> 02:49:29,110
because i i genuinely don't have any idea how i died yeah it
just heated me out of the van it did i watched it happened

Who murdered who?

3639
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:14,040
Phoebe, I just saw you drop that hammer, very suspiciously.

3640
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:15,180
Was it you?

3641
02:53:16,220 --> 02:53:16,820
It's for healing.

3642
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:18,080
It's for healing.

3643
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:18,720
Hold on.

3644
02:53:18,780 --> 02:53:20,500

3645
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:21,080
Wait, hold on.

3646
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:21,860
Is there any of you?

3647
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:22,400

Oh.

3653
02:53:31,560 --> 02:53:31,660
Oh.

3654
02:53:31,660 --> 02:53:31,820
Oh.

3655
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:32,240
Oh.

3656
02:53:32,240 --> 02:53:32,620
Minto.

3657
02:53:33,980 --> 02:53:35,260
What is she saying from the grieve?

3658
02:53:36,020 --> 02:53:37,060
A ghost though.

3659
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:38,760
So how does that work?

3660
02:53:39,780 --> 02:53:39,940
Oh.

3661
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:40,500
No.

3662
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:44,300
All right.

3663
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:45,680
Are we good to go then?

3664
02:53:45,820 --> 02:53:46,600

3665
02:53:49,300 --> 02:53:49,960
Oh wait.

3666
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:51,500
There's a beer still down here.

3667
02:53:51,540 --> 02:53:52,740
I think if we want to.

3668
02:53:52,820 --> 02:53:53,020
Yeah.

3669
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:53,960

needed yeah they're for the drink so that you don't they

3675
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:42,120

It was like, there was like avocado in it.

3679
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,140
It was like avocado teriyaki sauce.

3680
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:06,480
Oh.

3681
02:55:07,020 --> 02:55:09,060
And then like really nice patty and an egg.

3682
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:10,340
I pat an egg in it as well.

3683
02:55:10,660 --> 02:55:11,020
Oh.

3684
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:14,080
It wasn't Wendy's, was it?

3685
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:16,520
No, it wasn't Wendy's.

3686
02:55:16,540 --> 02:55:17,820
Although they do have Wendy's here.

3687
02:55:17,940 --> 02:55:18,360
Yeah.

3688
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:21,980
They have like the teriyaki burger.

3689
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:25,220
I mean, that sounds good.

3690
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:28,280
I actually like Wendy's.

3691
02:55:28,360 --> 02:55:29,220
Me too.

3692
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:32,420
They have interesting stuff, like baked potatoes.

3693
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:33,460
You know?

3694
02:55:35,260 --> 02:55:36,520
What are you trying to say, Vicky?

3695
02:55:38,020 --> 02:55:40,400
Yeah, they've got baked potatoes at Wendy's.

3696
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:42,400
Yeah, that's what I always get.

3697
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:43,840
At Wendy's.

3698
02:55:43,860 --> 02:55:44,800
Wait, you two?

3699
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:46,000
No, I don't know.

3700
02:55:51,890 --> 02:55:52,290
Sorry.

3701
02:55:52,890 --> 02:55:53,690
My apologies.

3702
02:55:53,750 --> 02:55:54,730
No, no, never apologize.

3703
02:55:54,730 --> 02:55:58,010
She did it this time while the car was not moving.

3704
02:55:58,750 --> 02:55:59,910
Oh, I think that's used.

3705
02:55:59,970 --> 02:56:01,310
I don't think we can use that again.

3706
02:56:02,450 --> 02:56:03,910
Oh, oh, it's like Dundas.

3707
02:56:03,950 --> 02:56:05,490
Yeah, I think so.

3708
02:56:05,650 --> 02:56:07,070
Oh, it's done, done.

3709
02:56:07,250 --> 02:56:08,030
Oh, you're right.

3710
02:56:09,750 --> 02:56:10,250
But that's it.

3711
02:56:10,430 --> 02:56:11,270
Dun, dun, dun.

3712
02:56:12,610 --> 02:56:15,570
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

3713
02:56:15,890 --> 02:56:16,050
Dun,

3714
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:19,110
dun, dun.

3715
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:19,410
Alright.

3716
02:56:20,070 --> 02:56:20,810
Let's go!

3717
02:56:21,690 --> 02:56:22,670
I think we're good to leave.

3718
02:56:22,730 --> 02:56:24,110
Should we take this repair hammer with us?

3719
02:56:24,370 --> 02:56:25,670
I think that's probably a good shout.

3720
02:56:25,970 --> 02:56:26,830
Oh, probably.

3721
02:56:32,140 --> 02:56:33,480
Oh, probably.

3722
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:35,900
Just take all the tools, actually.

3723
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:38,080
Yeah, why not?

3724
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:38,620
Why not?

3725
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:40,120
They've got a place where they can go anyway.

3726
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:44,540
I think there was one more winch controller.

3727
02:56:44,840 --> 02:56:46,100
Because ours is gone, actually.

3728
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:47,920
So I don't know where it is.

3729
02:56:47,980 --> 02:56:48,600
Wait, is it?

3730
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:49,160
Yeah.

3731
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:50,020
Gone?

3732
02:56:50,560 --> 02:56:53,100
Yeah, if I hadn't grabbed that one, it wouldn't have...

3733
02:56:53,100 --> 02:56:54,240
I don't know where it is.

3734
02:56:55,620 --> 02:56:56,040
Sorry.

3735
02:56:56,240 --> 02:56:57,620
Was I in control of it last?

3736
02:56:57,760 --> 02:56:59,620
That's probably the mistake that we all made.

3737
02:56:59,860 --> 02:57:01,080
I thought I saw one down here.

3738
02:57:02,620 --> 02:57:03,760
Maybe I'm crazy.

3739
02:57:05,980 --> 02:57:06,380
All right.

3740
02:57:06,660 --> 02:57:07,620
another one too.

3741
02:57:07,780 --> 02:57:08,760
I thought I saw one.

3742
02:57:11,500 --> 02:57:14,100
Well, we have the winch controller in here.

3743
02:57:14,260 --> 02:57:15,440
Is this the one that was on the floor?

3744
02:57:15,700 --> 02:57:17,400
Yeah, that's the one that was in the garage.

3745
02:57:17,800 --> 02:57:17,800
Yeah.

3746
02:57:18,840 --> 02:57:19,280
Okay.

3747
02:57:19,740 --> 02:57:20,760
So I think we're good then.

3748
02:57:20,800 --> 02:57:21,400
At least we have one.

3749
02:57:22,480 --> 02:57:23,200
Okie dokie.

3750
02:57:23,800 --> 02:57:23,800
Alright.

3751
02:57:24,500 --> 02:57:24,940
Yippee!

3752
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:26,880
Woohoo!

3753
02:57:28,040 --> 02:57:29,040
Y'all good to go?

3754
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:29,720
I will be seated.

3755
02:57:30,260 --> 02:57:31,640
Take us home, Phoebe.

3756
02:57:33,460 --> 02:57:34,300
Take me home.

3757
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:36,000
Oh wait, I forgot to turn on the engine.

3758
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:39,790
There we go.

3759
02:57:40,940 --> 02:57:42,340
Take me home.

3760
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:46,020
To the place.

3761
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:48,820
I belong!

3762
02:57:49,720 --> 02:57:50,400
Follow me!

3763
02:57:50,980 --> 02:57:51,780
West Virginia!

3764
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:52,640
Okay, it's fine.

3765
02:57:52,780 --> 02:57:53,980
We're fine.

3766
02:57:57,720 --> 02:57:59,500
I'll make it.

3767
02:57:59,700 --> 02:58:00,860
Oh my god.

3768
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:02,280
On tree road.

3769
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:04,480
I think I gotta reverse first.

3770
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:05,320
Road.

3771
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:13,480
Oh my god!

3772
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:16,620
Oh my god!

3773
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:16,980
Oh my god!

3774
02:58:16,980 --> 02:58:17,720
Don't do it, Phoebe!

3775
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:18,620
Don't do it!

3776
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:19,100
No!

3777
02:58:19,680 --> 02:58:19,680
God!

3778
02:58:20,020 --> 02:58:20,560
Oh god!

3779
02:58:20,900 --> 02:58:21,320
No, please!

3780
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:23,660
Oh, you're like going...

3781
02:58:23,660 --> 02:58:23,660
Mento!

3782
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Mento, where are you?

3783
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:26,460
Mento, I'm here to eat the guy, you!

3784
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:30,280
Okay, are you in?

3785
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:30,680
Are you in?

3786
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:31,640
I'm in!

3787
02:58:32,660 --> 02:58:33,740
Oh, uh, yeah.

3788
02:58:34,040 --> 02:58:36,500
Wait, uh, wait, um...

3789
02:58:36,660 --> 02:58:37,760
Wait, oh, I'm in.

3790
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:38,280
I'm in.

3791
02:58:38,860 --> 02:58:39,880
Oh, okay.

3792
02:58:40,980 --> 02:58:41,520
Okay!

3793
02:58:43,420 --> 02:58:43,960
Yeah!

3794
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:46,900
Ooh!

3795
02:58:48,420 --> 02:58:49,500
To the left.

3796
02:58:50,180 --> 02:58:51,140
To the right.

3797
02:58:51,700 --> 02:58:53,080
Oh my god.

3798
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:56,880
Not to the...

3799
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:58,960
To keep going right and then to the left.

3800
02:58:59,880 --> 02:59:00,520
To the left.

3801
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:01,980
Oh, hard left.

3802
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:02,560
Hard left.

3803
02:59:02,580 --> 02:59:03,380
I'm so scared.

3804
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:04,460
Hard left.

3805
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:05,020
Hard left.

3806
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:05,920
Hard left.

3807
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:08,560
Hard left.

3808
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:09,120
Harder.

3809
02:59:10,060 --> 02:59:10,540
Harder.

3810
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:11,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3811
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:13,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3812
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:15,100
You're so good at driving.

3813
02:59:15,260 --> 02:59:19,140
You say that, but what happened there?

3814
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:21,200
Don't worry, I can repair.

3815
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:22,020
Let's put the windshield.

3816
02:59:22,980 --> 02:59:24,520
Don't worry about it.

3817
02:59:24,980 --> 02:59:25,900
All right, keep going.

3818
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:26,460
Keep going.

3819
02:59:26,580 --> 02:59:27,360
Don't worry, don't worry.

3820
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:28,520
All fixed, all fixed, guys.

3821
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:28,920
All fixed.

3822
02:59:29,560 --> 02:59:31,160
It's another one of these.

3823
02:59:32,380 --> 02:59:32,780
Oh!

3824
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:34,020
Oh.

3825
02:59:35,460 --> 02:59:36,540
Wait, keep going?

3826
02:59:36,660 --> 02:59:38,600
What do you...

3827
02:59:38,600 --> 02:59:39,260
Just keep going?

3828
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:41,780
Maybe just floor it.

3829
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:42,300
Ooh.

3830
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:44,840
Oh, there's like a tiny little ram.

3831
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:47,220
Wait, hold on.

3832
02:59:47,300 --> 02:59:48,680
I'll get out and I'll direct you.

3833
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:49,800
Ah!

3834
02:59:50,860 --> 02:59:51,640
Thank you.

3835
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:52,020
Whoa!

3836
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:53,200
What is it?

3837
02:59:53,260 --> 02:59:53,680
What is it?

3838
02:59:53,700 --> 02:59:54,160
What happened?

3839
02:59:54,400 --> 02:59:54,900
It's a bear.

3840
02:59:54,920 --> 02:59:55,760
I think it might be a bear.

3841
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:57,400
Do we have any spray?

3842
02:59:57,700 --> 02:59:58,660
Oh, my God.

3843
02:59:58,860 --> 02:59:59,200
Run over.

3844
02:59:59,280 --> 02:59:59,600
Run over.

3845
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:00,940
Floor it.

3846
03:00:00,980 --> 03:00:01,100
Floor it.

3847
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:01,880
Floor it.

3848
03:00:02,220 --> 03:00:02,480
Oh.

3849
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:03,880
Oh.

3850
03:00:03,880 --> 03:00:04,120
Oh.

3851
03:00:16,140 --> 03:00:16,700
He's

3852
03:00:22,480 --> 03:00:24,460
bumping on the lake, look.

3853
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:29,880
Oh, wait, why did he jump?

3854
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:32,180
Wait, you guys, he just jumped.

3855
03:00:32,980 --> 03:00:33,380
He jumped?

3856
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:34,500
He jumped?

3857
03:00:34,900 --> 03:00:35,200
What?

3858
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:37,560
No, the bear can't jump.

3859
03:00:37,960 --> 03:00:38,500
Oh, no, no, no.

3860
03:00:38,500 --> 03:00:38,980
He's run away.

3861
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:39,820
He's run away.

3862
03:00:40,680 --> 03:00:41,680
You run away.

3863
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:45,100
What is, what is the physics on the bear right now?

3864
03:00:52,260 --> 03:00:53,700
He's trying so hard.

3865
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:56,320
He's killed the cliff!

3866
03:00:57,700 --> 03:00:58,680
Wait, he's gone, he's gone!

3867
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:00,240
He just disappeared into the cliff.

3868
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:01,420
Oh my god.

3869
03:01:18,490 --> 03:01:19,470
What just happened?

3870
03:01:22,570 --> 03:01:26,070
That went really well.

3871
03:01:26,290 --> 03:01:29,450
Guys, the snake is like right next to our stuff.

3872
03:01:31,650 --> 03:01:35,490
I mean, look, we just took on an Isakai bear.

3873
03:01:35,770 --> 03:01:37,530
I don't think we need to be afraid of the snake.

3874
03:01:37,810 --> 03:01:38,050
Oh.

3875
03:01:38,370 --> 03:01:40,030
Lady, go after me!

3876
03:01:49,860 --> 03:01:51,180
You two.

3877
03:01:55,380 --> 03:01:55,660
Okay.

3878
03:01:59,320 --> 03:02:02,760
Oh my gosh, it really reaches from all the way over there.

3879
03:02:03,460 --> 03:02:04,200
It died.

3880
03:02:04,740 --> 03:02:07,020
Oh my god!

3881
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:08,440
Why is it- Oh!

3882
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:11,440
Oh!

3883
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:18,180
Thanks!

3884
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:19,340
Sorry!

3885
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:21,520
Oh, Vicky, it's okay!

3886
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:26,080
He's like, inconveniently position snake.

3887
03:02:26,380 --> 03:02:27,860
He's like right underneath her.

3888
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:28,340
It's very annoying.

3889
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:29,780
It's so annoying.

3890
03:02:29,800 --> 03:02:33,220
Can that snake can that snake just calm down?

3891
03:02:36,320 --> 03:02:37,660
Like it ain't a thrill anymore.

3892
03:02:37,780 --> 03:02:38,800
It's just a boar, bro.

3893
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:43,640
I'm gonna go to the rock and get the stuff from over there.

3894
03:02:44,500 --> 03:02:44,800
Oh my gosh.

3895
03:02:44,900 --> 03:02:48,700
It's such an... It's so annoying that we have to recollect
everything each time.

3896
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:50,740
Yeah.

3897
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:56,440
Yeah.

3898
03:02:57,400 --> 03:02:59,280
Knows you're a snake eater, Mintel.

3899
03:02:59,560 --> 03:03:00,020
No!

3900
03:03:00,140 --> 03:03:02,180
Knows about your interests.

3901
03:03:02,960 --> 03:03:03,300
Yeah.

3902
03:03:03,980 --> 03:03:07,020
He's like, I'm just trying to return the favor.

3903
03:03:10,220 --> 03:03:11,460
What else we need to get?

3904
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:12,540
Should I make burgers?

3905
03:03:13,660 --> 03:03:14,520
Yes, please.

3906
03:03:14,520 --> 03:03:16,780
I mean, I'm poisoned, so I could definitely do with a
burger.

3907
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:18,400
Burger.

3908
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:19,000
Okay.

3909
03:03:20,820 --> 03:03:22,460
Will beer help the poison?

3910
03:03:23,060 --> 03:03:23,660
I don't know.

3911
03:03:24,560 --> 03:03:27,160
Actually, it'll help the feeling.

3912
03:03:29,140 --> 03:03:32,660
Um, I don't need a burger anymore.

3913
03:03:33,140 --> 03:03:34,280
Oh, I got some bear spray.

3914
03:03:34,640 --> 03:03:35,240
Oh, okay.

3915
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:37,000
Bear spray!

3916
03:03:37,460 --> 03:03:38,740
That is what we need.

3917
03:03:38,940 --> 03:03:38,960
Hey, yo!

3918
03:03:39,420 --> 03:03:40,520
Oh, that is what we need.

3919
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:42,720
Wait, there's a ton of stuff over here.

3920

Oh, yeah?

03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:48,600
Yeah, I'm gonna come try to help you carry stuff.

3922
03:03:48,700 --> 03:03:51,620
Yeah, I think if you want to grab the grill, I think we'll
be good.

3923
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:53,820
I don't know what we need the lotion for yet.

3924
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:56,160

On the Barbie.

3955
03:06:15,330 --> 03:06:16,370
Burgers on the Barbie.

3956
03:06:16,450 --> 03:06:17,530
Surf and turf.

3957
03:06:19,150 --> 03:06:21,970
The beers could also be on the Barbie if we want.

3958
03:06:22,070 --> 03:06:23,710
The beers are also on the Barbie.

3959
03:06:25,610 --> 03:06:26,590
On the Barbie.

3960
03:06:27,390 --> 03:06:27,770
Yeah.

3961
03:06:28,830 --> 03:06:30,390
No, I feel about that.

3962
03:06:36,340 --> 03:06:37,640
Oh, so close.

3963
03:06:39,980 --> 03:06:42,940
Were you chucking that coffee just for fun or do you want me
to put it in the bag?

3964
03:06:43,160 --> 03:06:44,440
No, I was gonna grab it.

3965
03:06:44,620 --> 03:06:45,040
I was gonna...

3966
03:06:45,040 --> 03:06:46,140
Oh, I was chucking things to put in the bag.

3967
03:06:47,880 --> 03:06:48,300
Okay.

3968
03:06:49,420 --> 03:06:51,500
Oh, but they're rolling back down the hill.

3969
03:06:51,740 --> 03:06:52,980
Oh, I just realized my mistake.

3970
03:06:53,080 --> 03:06:55,820
I've been chucking things at the hill and they've been
rolling back down.

3971
03:06:55,860 --> 03:06:56,660
I got it.

3972
03:06:56,680 --> 03:06:57,340
I got it.

3973
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:59,100
I've been putting them in.

3974
03:06:59,220 --> 03:06:59,660
It's okay.

3975
03:07:00,700 --> 03:07:01,000
Oh.

3976
03:07:01,820 --> 03:07:02,180
Okay.

3977
03:07:03,220 --> 03:07:03,500
Okay.

3978
03:07:03,500 --> 03:07:04,800
Do we want to take this lotion?

3979
03:07:05,020 --> 03:07:07,340
Still don't really know what the lotion does, but sure.

3980
03:07:09,780 --> 03:07:10,140
Okay.

3981
03:07:10,580 --> 03:07:11,360
All right, guys.

3982
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:13,820
I think we're back to business.

3983
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:15,060
Yay!

3984
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:17,220
This guy.

3985
03:07:17,220 --> 03:07:18,140
Did someone just get bitten?

3986
03:07:18,420 --> 03:07:18,780
No.

3987
03:07:19,940 --> 03:07:20,300
Okay.

3988
03:07:20,780 --> 03:07:21,040
Nice.

3989
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:22,720
All right.

3990
03:07:23,240 --> 03:07:24,640
Yeah, bear spray is important.

3991
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:28,040
Do we want the bear spray on the floor or can we put it in
the cupboard?

3992
03:07:28,220 --> 03:07:29,060
Oh, we can put it in the cupboard.

3993
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:30,360
We can, okay.

3994
03:07:30,500 --> 03:07:30,620
Cool.

3995
03:07:31,540 --> 03:07:33,100
Yeah, then it won't just fall out.

3996
03:07:33,320 --> 03:07:34,420
I don't think we can put burgers in there.

3997
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:36,420
Wait, I'm going to put this upstairs.

3998
03:07:37,560 --> 03:07:38,340
This big guy.

3999
03:07:39,700 --> 03:07:41,080
Wait, can I even...

4000
03:07:41,080 --> 03:07:43,060
Wait, did we have to repair the...

4001
03:07:43,060 --> 03:07:44,540
Oh, yeah, we have to repair...

4002
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:46,880
The ladder again.

4003
03:07:47,080 --> 03:07:48,820
How long does it go for fire or burn damage?

4004
03:07:48,920 --> 03:07:50,420
Wait, we can get damaged by fire?

4005
03:07:50,500 --> 03:07:51,360
When's that going to happen?

4006
03:07:51,560 --> 03:07:53,120
Oh, yeah, when's that going to happen?

4007
03:07:54,440 --> 03:07:55,120
Oh, geez.

4008
03:07:55,360 --> 03:07:56,200
What side is the ladder?

4009
03:07:56,600 --> 03:07:59,500
I hope it's not the other side because that's where the
snake is.

4010
03:08:00,260 --> 03:08:01,520
That is where the snake is.

4011
03:08:01,540 --> 03:08:03,420
Snake is...

4012
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:05,100
Oh my god.

4013
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:06,500
Snake is just...

4014
03:08:06,500 --> 03:08:08,140
Snake's twerking as well, look.

4015
03:08:08,660 --> 03:08:09,780
I think it's on this side, no?

4016
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:10,400
Look at that.

4017
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:10,860
Oh.

4018
03:08:11,220 --> 03:08:11,460
Ow!

4019
03:08:11,580 --> 03:08:13,140
The snake is under the van twerking.

4020
03:08:13,260 --> 03:08:14,180
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4021
03:08:14,420 --> 03:08:16,340
This happened the last time, too.

4022
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:17,440
Here you go.

4023
03:08:17,580 --> 03:08:18,080
Thank you.

4024
03:08:18,300 --> 03:08:21,420
Is there another murder investigation that I need...

4025
03:08:21,420 --> 03:08:22,780
Detective Vicky needs to get involved in?

4026
03:08:23,320 --> 03:08:23,740
Perhaps.

4027
03:08:23,900 --> 03:08:24,500
She's alive.

4028
03:08:24,660 --> 03:08:26,660
I mean, wait, no, she's not alive.

4029
03:08:26,800 --> 03:08:27,780
Excuse me, baby!

4030
03:08:28,340 --> 03:08:29,660
That was an admission of guilt!

4031
03:08:29,720 --> 03:08:30,840
That was an admission of guilt!

4032
03:08:31,540 --> 03:08:34,720
I am butterfingers.

4033
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:36,140
I am butterfingers.

4034
03:08:37,480 --> 03:08:41,980
If you accidentally kill a person, what is that called?

4035
03:08:43,500 --> 03:08:44,000
Homicide!

4036
03:08:44,700 --> 03:08:45,120
Homicide!

4037
03:08:46,140 --> 03:08:47,040
Death is dead!

4038
03:08:47,700 --> 03:08:48,540
Yeah, Phoebe.

4039
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:50,420
Oh, wait.

4040
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:52,760
That snake is so loud.

4041
03:08:55,980 --> 03:08:57,300
Are we good to go then?

4042
03:08:59,740 --> 03:09:00,440
Did someone get bit?

4043
03:09:00,580 --> 03:09:00,920
I think so.

4044
03:09:01,980 --> 03:09:03,440
Yeah, I think we're good.

4045
03:09:03,540 --> 03:09:03,820
Okay.

4046
03:09:05,180 --> 03:09:05,600
Awesome.

4047
03:09:07,060 --> 03:09:08,340
I will be seated.

4048
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:09,720
Let's go, baby.

4049
03:09:10,040 --> 03:09:10,340
Let's go.

4050
03:09:11,900 --> 03:09:12,640
Let's go.

4051
03:09:13,580 --> 03:09:13,960
Woo-hoo!

4052
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:15,780
We'll make it this time.

4053
03:09:16,700 --> 03:09:17,940
We'll make it this time.

4054
03:09:19,460 --> 03:09:21,360
I am quite scared for that bridge.

4055
03:09:22,140 --> 03:09:25,760
Well, as long as there's not a bear, I think we can make, we
can figure it out.

4056
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:26,560
Oh, shall I?

4057
03:09:26,860 --> 03:09:29,800
I'm going to get the bear spray in my hand right now, just
in case.

4058
03:09:30,020 --> 03:09:30,820
Just in case.

4059
03:09:30,820 --> 03:09:33,140
But that's a windshield?

4060
03:09:33,500 --> 03:09:35,960
That was the roof shield, but that's okay.

4061
03:09:40,900 --> 03:09:45,220
The door also is not looking great.

4062
03:09:45,480 --> 03:09:46,040
Convenient exit.

4063
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:48,780
In this case, it would be meat slaughter.

4064
03:09:52,820 --> 03:09:54,280
Let's try just to bore it.

4065
03:09:54,500 --> 03:09:55,220
Is that what we're going to do?

4066
03:09:56,100 --> 03:09:56,480
Bear?

4067
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:57,560
Is there a bear?

4068
03:09:58,840 --> 03:10:00,800
I use the best profile.

4069
03:10:00,820 --> 03:10:02,500
Did this, ohhhh.

4070
03:10:02,500 --> 03:10:03,380
There's a second bear spray.

4071
03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:04,960
I think there's a second one somewhere.

4072
03:10:05,380 --> 03:10:06,680
There's a second one.

4073
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:07,800
Oh, that's good.

4074
03:10:08,940 --> 03:10:09,480
Is there?

4075
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:10,640
I don't know.

4076
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:14,040
I don't think there is.

4077
03:10:14,980 --> 03:10:16,480
I don't think there is.

4078
03:10:16,660 --> 03:10:17,220
Oh, really?

4079
03:10:17,900 --> 03:10:18,820
I don't think so.

4080
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:19,800
Oh.

4081
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:21,460
Wait, check all the cabinets.

4082
03:10:21,740 --> 03:10:22,920
Open every cabinet.

4083
03:10:23,580 --> 03:10:23,600
Oh.

4084
03:10:24,820 --> 03:10:25,300
Oh.

4085
03:10:25,420 --> 03:10:26,100
Oh yeah, Vanta Do.

4086
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:27,360
Wait, Vicky, don't you need that?

4087
03:10:27,440 --> 03:10:30,260
I am going to repair the door in the meantime.

4088
03:10:31,360 --> 03:10:34,420
And maybe some windows and things.

4089
03:10:34,460 --> 03:10:35,680
We can get him with the ball.

4090
03:10:35,880 --> 03:10:36,860
We can get him with the ball.

4091
03:10:39,220 --> 03:10:39,820
Oh, yeah.

4092
03:10:40,060 --> 03:10:40,560
Yeah, with the ball.

4093
03:10:42,100 --> 03:10:42,840
Oh, no.

4094
03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:43,780
See?

4095
03:10:44,080 --> 03:10:45,300
Is it normal scrap mail?

4096
03:10:47,080 --> 03:10:47,280
Huh?

4097
03:10:47,380 --> 03:10:48,060
Oh, did I fix it?

4098
03:10:48,200 --> 03:10:48,420
I already know.

4099
03:10:48,500 --> 03:10:49,780
No, you were hitting my head.

4100
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:50,180
That's why.

4101
03:10:50,980 --> 03:10:51,980
Oh, so sorry.

4102
03:10:52,160 --> 03:10:52,420
Ow, ow, ow.

4103
03:10:53,580 --> 03:10:53,960
Fuck.

4104
03:10:55,680 --> 03:10:56,080
Manslaughter.

4105
03:10:57,080 --> 03:10:58,160
Ouch, ow, ow.

4106
03:10:59,540 --> 03:11:00,540
She's gone mad.

4107
03:11:01,480 --> 03:11:02,680
She's gone mad.

4108
03:11:02,980 --> 03:11:04,040
Use high gear, I'm begging you.

4109
03:11:04,360 --> 03:11:06,900
We gotta build up to high gear, right?

4110
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:08,000
Probably.

4111
03:11:08,820 --> 03:11:09,620
Yeah, right?

4112
03:11:10,520 --> 03:11:11,840
That's how much we know about it.

4113
03:11:12,580 --> 03:11:15,140
You go to one and then the two and then the three.

4114
03:11:16,660 --> 03:11:20,100
So maybe I should back up and try to build up to that.

4115
03:11:20,580 --> 03:11:21,260
Don't say it.

4116
03:11:21,360 --> 03:11:21,860
Seven and eight.

4117
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:24,680
And a six.

4118
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:26,840
Oh, I'm so scared.

4119
03:11:26,960 --> 03:11:27,700
I'm so freaking scared.

4120
03:11:27,980 --> 03:11:28,720
And a six and a seven.

4121
03:11:28,860 --> 03:11:30,200
Then the back, I'm so sure.

4122
03:11:30,820 --> 03:11:52,540
you die and the game crashes and it deletes our save okay
okay you can do this baby you can do this you can do this so

4123
03:11:52,540 --> 03:12:03,080
what did we do last time that didn't work we were not fast
enough yeah oh you need to be fast Maybe if you go for

4124
03:12:03,080 --> 03:12:04,800
someone said skip second gear.

4125
03:12:05,200 --> 03:12:05,900
Is that true?

4126
03:12:07,020 --> 03:12:08,000
Anybody who drives manual.

4127
03:12:08,240 --> 03:12:09,940
I don't know whether to believe them or not.

4128
03:12:10,220 --> 03:12:10,820
I don't know.

4129
03:12:10,940 --> 03:12:14,320
I know you guys there's somebody in chat that can drive
manual.

4130
03:12:15,420 --> 03:12:15,680
Tell us.

4131
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:17,900
Say one to three.

4132
03:12:18,120 --> 03:12:18,700
Yeah, see one to three.

4133
03:12:18,900 --> 03:12:20,120
You gotta build up.

4134
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:21,800
Oh, they said yes, you can skip.

4135
03:12:22,860 --> 03:12:23,720
You can, you can.

4136
03:12:24,020 --> 03:12:24,060
You can?

4137
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:26,220
You can?

4138
03:12:26,920 --> 03:12:27,260
Okay.

4139
03:12:28,600 --> 03:12:29,720
Go, baby, go!

4140
03:12:29,960 --> 03:12:30,240
No!

4141
03:12:30,980 --> 03:12:31,360
Yes!

4142
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:34,460
Okay, skipping a three did not work there.

4143
03:12:34,580 --> 03:12:35,920
No, I think you gotta really build it up.

4144
03:12:35,980 --> 03:12:38,100
I think you gotta do three at the very last second.

4145
03:12:40,220 --> 03:12:40,420
Okay.

4146
03:12:40,500 --> 03:12:43,040
Gotta rev out one before going three, apparently.

4147
03:12:43,260 --> 03:12:43,780
Okay, okay.

4148
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:46,340
Maybe once you get to the top of the hill, go to three.

4149
03:12:47,220 --> 03:12:48,860
Yeah, on the hill, stay at one.

4150
03:12:48,960 --> 03:12:50,460
Once you're over the hill, go to three.

4151
03:12:51,220 --> 03:12:52,280
Three when going downhill.

4152
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:53,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4153
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:55,780
Okay.

4154
03:12:56,340 --> 03:12:56,720
Okay.

4155
03:12:59,060 --> 03:12:59,640
Oh no.

4156
03:13:00,060 --> 03:13:00,620
Did it work?

4157
03:13:00,820 --> 03:13:01,240
Oh!

4158
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:03,360
Wait, is it?

4159
03:13:03,720 --> 03:13:05,300
Um, it's really not...

4160
03:13:06,940 --> 03:13:07,300
It's...

4161
03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:09,060
Try, go to four!

4162
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:09,880
Go to four!

4163
03:13:11,060 --> 03:13:12,420
I'm on four, I'm on four!

4164
03:13:12,720 --> 03:13:13,180
I think...

4165
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:14,920
Okay, back it up, back it up, yeah.

4166
03:13:15,300 --> 03:13:16,300
Yeah, back it up, back it up, back it up.

4167
03:13:16,380 --> 03:13:17,640
Back it up, back it up, back it up.

4168
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:23,060
Okay, I'm there.

4169
03:13:23,100 --> 03:13:25,220
Minto, you seem to be outside the windshield.

4170
03:13:25,480 --> 03:13:25,860
Are you okay?

4171
03:13:26,180 --> 03:13:27,040
Oh, how did I...

4172
03:13:27,040 --> 03:13:28,320
Wait, but we have a windshield.

4173
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:29,420
How did that happen?

4174
03:13:29,820 --> 03:13:30,720
I don't know.

4175
03:13:30,820 --> 03:13:32,320
This happened to be several times.

4176
03:13:32,420 --> 03:13:34,020
I think that's how you randomly die.

4177
03:13:34,840 --> 03:13:35,320
Hold on.

4178
03:13:35,400 --> 03:13:36,280
Get back in here.

4179
03:13:38,420 --> 03:13:39,960
How did I do that?

4180
03:13:40,720 --> 03:13:43,880
I think that's the main way of random death in this game.

4181
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:46,240
Okay, I can't get back in, so just...

4182
03:13:46,240 --> 03:13:47,140
Just go.

4183
03:13:47,520 --> 03:13:47,700
I'm coming.

4184
03:13:48,420 --> 03:13:48,940
I'm coming.

4185
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:49,460
I'll pick you up.

4186
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:50,180
Pick me up.

4187
03:13:50,240 --> 03:13:50,980
Oh, yeah, thank you.

4188
03:13:51,180 --> 03:13:51,360
Yeah.

4189
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:52,020
There you go.

4190
03:13:52,240 --> 03:13:52,940
Okay, thank you.

4191
03:13:53,060 --> 03:13:53,300
All right.

4192
03:13:55,360 --> 03:13:57,580
I also saw one, two, four.

4193
03:13:57,780 --> 03:14:00,800
So maybe go one and then...

4194
03:14:00,820 --> 03:14:09,760
the hill at the top go two and then go to four it's because
if you go one to three there might not be enough time for

4195
03:14:09,760 --> 03:14:29,800
the three to kick in all right now one two okay now four
four I think you can't oh oh yeah baby now back to one back

4196
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:31,420
to one back to one Yeah!

4197
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:33,880
Yeah!

4198
03:14:35,860 --> 03:14:35,960
Woo!

4199
03:14:36,640 --> 03:14:36,840
Woo!

4200
03:14:37,760 --> 03:14:38,380
Yeah!

4201
03:14:40,260 --> 03:14:41,500
Oh my god!

4202
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:45,320
Oh my god!

4203
03:14:45,820 --> 03:14:47,380
Oh, thank goodness.

4204
03:14:49,520 --> 03:14:50,520
Incredible.

4205
03:14:51,180 --> 03:14:51,740
Holy cow.

4206
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:52,580
MVP.

4207
03:14:52,820 --> 03:14:54,080
MVP's MVP.

4208
03:14:54,420 --> 03:14:55,820
MVP's MVP.

4209
03:14:57,240 --> 03:14:57,600
Go.

4210
03:14:58,440 --> 03:14:59,040
Woo!

4211
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:01,500
Incredible.

4212
03:15:02,340 --> 03:15:02,800
What is that?

4213
03:15:02,840 --> 03:15:03,460
What is that?

4214
03:15:04,480 --> 03:15:05,200
What is what?

4215
03:15:05,320 --> 03:15:06,560
What is that in the road?

4216
03:15:07,360 --> 03:15:08,860
I hope it's not a bear.

4217
03:15:09,900 --> 03:15:11,160
Oh, oh, wait.

4218
03:15:11,360 --> 03:15:12,700
Okay, we got to build another bridge.

4219
03:15:12,900 --> 03:15:13,320
It's scarier than a bear.

4220
03:15:13,420 --> 03:15:14,600
We got to build another bridge.

4221
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:16,120
Okay, now on.

4222
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:17,780
I see.

4223
03:15:21,620 --> 03:15:22,020
Okay.

4224
03:15:22,140 --> 03:15:23,440
Can you keep doing it?

4225
03:15:23,520 --> 03:15:24,960
Can we just like...

4226
03:15:24,960 --> 03:15:25,620
Oh, oh, I see.

4227
03:15:25,680 --> 03:15:27,040
There is other wood.

4228
03:15:27,420 --> 03:15:27,660
Okay, like.

4229
03:15:28,020 --> 03:15:29,080
Are there other...

4230
03:15:29,080 --> 03:15:29,920
Oh!

4231
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:31,000
A bear!

4232
03:15:31,440 --> 03:15:31,820
Watch out!

4233
03:15:31,940 --> 03:15:31,980
Watch out!

4234
03:15:32,160 --> 03:15:32,360
Watch out!

4235
03:15:32,900 --> 03:15:33,660
Oh god!

4236
03:15:34,620 --> 03:15:35,420
Back in the van!

4237
03:15:35,540 --> 03:15:36,260
Go back in the van!

4238
03:15:38,280 --> 03:15:38,900
Oh no!

4239
03:15:39,300 --> 03:15:42,580
Oh, he looked at me and I scared him away.

4240
03:15:43,240 --> 03:15:45,220
Oh come on, why me?

4241
03:15:45,420 --> 03:15:46,880
Oh he's aggroed on you.

4242
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:50,060
It's because you're the MVP!

4243
03:15:52,740 --> 03:15:55,060
Okay guys, I know, I'll scare the bear.

4244
03:15:55,540 --> 03:15:58,200
Yeah, okay, so I'll scare the bear off and then we drive.

4245
03:15:59,080 --> 03:16:00,040
I think Phoebe just did that.

4246
03:16:00,260 --> 03:16:01,200
Phoebe, we need you!

4247
03:16:01,440 --> 03:16:02,580
Phoebe, I should be the prey!

4248
03:16:02,780 --> 03:16:03,180
Phoebe, come back!

4249
03:16:03,640 --> 03:16:05,720
Oh, but he's aggroed on me!

4250
03:16:06,480 --> 03:16:08,220
No, no, no, no, just, just...

4251
03:16:08,220 --> 03:16:09,860
I'll get him to aggro me, I'll get to aggro me!

4252
03:16:10,760 --> 03:16:12,040
Just keep running, Phoebe!

4253
03:16:12,680 --> 03:16:16,520
We'll, we'll get the car, we'll get it all mixed, we'll get
it all set up!

4254
03:16:16,760 --> 03:16:17,040
Okay.

4255
03:16:17,300 --> 03:16:17,700
Oh, shoot.

4256
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:18,540
Okay.

4257
03:16:21,020 --> 03:16:21,700
Oh, shoot.

4258
03:16:22,320 --> 03:16:23,040
Are you guys okay?

4259
03:16:23,240 --> 03:16:23,820
Did you run off?

4260
03:16:24,080 --> 03:16:25,180
Uh, I think he's on me.

4261
03:16:25,280 --> 03:16:26,160
I'm following him.

4262
03:16:26,280 --> 03:16:27,060
I'm following him.

4263
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:28,280
Oh!

4264
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:29,920
I'm inside the bear.

4265
03:16:31,220 --> 03:16:32,480
Inside the bear.

4266
03:16:33,680 --> 03:16:34,260
Can I drive?

4267
03:16:34,480 --> 03:16:34,900
Just go, guys.

4268
03:16:35,160 --> 03:16:36,020
I'm just driving the bear.

4269
03:16:36,380 --> 03:16:37,220
No, don't drive.

4270
03:16:37,700 --> 03:16:38,520
No, no.

4271
03:16:38,760 --> 03:16:39,060
You can't.

4272
03:16:39,060 --> 03:16:39,420
Don't drive.

4273
03:16:39,780 --> 03:16:39,860
No.

4274
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:40,440
Okay, don't drive.

4275
03:16:40,780 --> 03:16:40,980
No.

4276
03:16:41,580 --> 03:16:41,980
Okay.

4277
03:16:42,140 --> 03:16:42,840
No, don't drive.

4278
03:16:43,460 --> 03:16:43,460
No.

4279
03:16:43,860 --> 03:16:44,380
Don't do that.

4280
03:16:44,820 --> 03:16:45,820
Okay, the bear's gone.

4281
03:16:46,340 --> 03:16:46,860
Wait, really?

4282
03:16:47,020 --> 03:16:47,520
He just left?

4283
03:16:48,040 --> 03:16:48,480
Yippee!

4284
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:49,600
No, he's not gone.

4285
03:16:49,740 --> 03:16:51,180
Well, she, Vicky punched him.

4286
03:16:51,180 --> 03:16:51,640
I don't know where he is, though.

4287
03:16:51,860 --> 03:16:57,800
I think I might have absorbed the bear because I, like, I,
like, fused with the bear's model and then it's gone.

4288
03:16:57,940 --> 03:16:59,820
So I I think maybe we're safe.

4289
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:03,380
Either way, I think it's obsessed with me to go.

4290
03:17:05,800 --> 03:17:07,000
Do you still hear him or something?

4291
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:07,420
No.

4292
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:10,180
Yeah, I still hear him, but I can't see him.

4293
03:17:10,520 --> 03:17:12,500
So I think I, like, fused with him.

4294
03:17:12,820 --> 03:17:13,320
Oh, cool.

4295
03:17:13,800 --> 03:17:15,920
I think it was like Dragon Ball or something.

4296
03:17:19,280 --> 03:17:19,720
Okay.

4297
03:17:20,480 --> 03:17:22,500
Okay, I did the best I could do.

4298
03:17:23,940 --> 03:17:24,660
Thank you.

4299
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:26,760
Okay, be in a safe place.

4300
03:17:28,160 --> 03:17:28,780
really weird guys.

4301
03:17:28,860 --> 03:17:30,560
I can hear the bear, but it's not here.

4302
03:17:30,740 --> 03:17:31,220
But don't worry.

4303
03:17:31,360 --> 03:17:32,820
I think I've glitched the game, so just go.

4304
03:17:33,400 --> 03:17:33,400
Jesus.

4305
03:17:33,880 --> 03:17:38,920
Oh, I think the game, or not the game, I think the, you can
still hear the bear.

4306
03:17:40,120 --> 03:17:44,380
I think the tires are wider than I thought they would be.

4307
03:17:52,080 --> 03:17:53,000
Back it up, back it up.

4308
03:17:53,140 --> 03:17:53,940
Okay, there we go.

4309
03:17:54,900 --> 03:17:55,520
Oh, wait.

4310
03:17:55,720 --> 03:17:56,600
Oh, hold on.

4311
03:17:56,640 --> 03:17:57,040
One second.

4312
03:17:57,140 --> 03:17:57,440
One second.

4313
03:17:57,600 --> 03:17:57,940
Oh, Adam.

4314
03:17:58,300 --> 03:17:59,600
Oh, there we go.

4315
03:17:59,940 --> 03:18:00,820
Maybe it's okay.

4316
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:02,040
Maybe it's okay.

4317
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:05,480
Oh, wait, wait.

4318
03:18:05,560 --> 03:18:06,240
Oh, I messed up.

4319
03:18:06,380 --> 03:18:06,480
Wait.

4320
03:18:07,960 --> 03:18:08,660
There we go.

4321
03:18:08,760 --> 03:18:09,200
There we go.

4322
03:18:09,460 --> 03:18:10,020
Try now.

4323
03:18:10,880 --> 03:18:11,140
Okay.

4324
03:18:11,320 --> 03:18:12,140
Give it a try.

4325
03:18:12,380 --> 03:18:12,900
Yep, yep.

4326
03:18:13,160 --> 03:18:14,260
I can't hear the bear anymore.

4327
03:18:14,360 --> 03:18:15,400
I think it's safe for me to come back.

4328
03:18:15,560 --> 03:18:15,840
Okay.

4329
03:18:16,760 --> 03:18:17,200
Good.

4330
03:18:19,020 --> 03:18:20,460
I miss you so much.

4331
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:22,600
Oh, go to your left a little.

4332
03:18:23,380 --> 03:18:24,040
Your left.

4333
03:18:24,260 --> 03:18:24,660
Go right.

4334
03:18:25,080 --> 03:18:26,480
Okay, in reverse.

4335
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:27,240
No, no.

4336
03:18:27,740 --> 03:18:27,860
No.

4337
03:18:28,060 --> 03:18:28,060
Oh.

4338
03:18:28,520 --> 03:18:29,180
Oh, okay.

4339
03:18:29,400 --> 03:18:30,300

You got it.

4344
03:18:36,920 --> 03:18:37,180
All right.

4345
03:18:37,380 --> 03:18:37,880
Now stop.

4346
03:18:38,540 --> 03:18:39,780
Yeah, stop completely.

4347
03:18:42,100 --> 03:18:46,620
I'm going to have a beer in hand in case you need a push in.

4348
03:18:47,060 --> 03:18:47,760
Oh, thank you.

4349
03:18:48,260 --> 03:18:48,500
Okay.

03:18:50,860 --> 03:18:51,060
Okay.

You can go in and get it.

4358
03:19:01,200 --> 03:19:02,100
I've been in there before.

4359
03:19:03,240 --> 03:19:03,640
I do.

4360
03:19:03,880 --> 03:19:04,400
Oh, watch out.

4361
03:19:04,420 --> 03:19:05,260
Oh, dang it.

Do I need this one or should I do that somewhere else?

This is not the best environment for practice.

Oh, you're back.

Can we take one with us?

4470
03:22:57,930 --> 03:22:58,710
They're not even real.

4471
03:23:00,350 --> 03:23:02,070
Yeah, I'll drive it over to them.

4472
03:23:02,850 --> 03:23:03,850
Yeah, roll one with us.

Oh, okay, good.

4474
03:23:05,110 --> 03:23:06,230
Okay, I'm just gonna hold it.

Just go!

4480
03:23:23,670 --> 03:23:25,250
I'll go chase the bear again.

4481
03:23:25,310 --> 03:23:26,430
I'll become one with the bear.

4482
03:23:27,250 --> 03:23:28,830
Oh my god, he's right behind me.

4483
03:23:29,370 --> 03:23:30,010
Oh my god.

4484
03:23:30,430 --> 03:23:31,410
Oh my god.

4485
03:23:31,590 --> 03:23:32,650
Oh my god.

4486
03:23:34,350 --> 03:23:36,330
Oh he doesn't like the water.

4487
03:23:36,870 --> 03:23:38,010
He doesn't like the water.

4488
03:23:42,410 --> 03:23:42,730
I'm dead.

4489
03:23:44,290 --> 03:23:46,030
But don't worry, I'm distracting him.

4490
03:23:46,170 --> 03:23:49,340
He's still there.

4491
03:23:49,420 --> 03:23:50,100
Just go guys.

4492
03:23:50,340 --> 03:23:51,000

Get the checkpoint.

03:24:05,200 --> 03:24:05,980
Oh, does someone revive me?

4506
03:24:06,800 --> 03:24:07,500

4567
03:27:50,450 --> 03:27:51,150
Should I keep cranking?

4568
03:27:51,430 --> 03:27:52,530
Yeah, just keep cranking.

4569
03:27:52,870 --> 03:27:53,750
Um, okay.

4570
03:27:54,130 --> 03:27:56,530
Let me take a look outside, see.

4571
03:27:56,950 --> 03:27:58,290
I think I go to the right.

4572
03:27:58,310 --> 03:28:00,570
Now we can go to the right.

4573
03:28:00,990 --> 03:28:01,230
Oops.

4574
03:28:01,670 --> 03:28:02,010
Sorry.

4575
03:28:02,750 --> 03:28:03,470
Oh, okay.

4576
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:04,790
Oh, oh.

4577
03:28:04,790 --> 03:28:05,290
Oh, my God.

4578
03:28:05,510 --> 03:28:07,170
I'm just gonna keep cranking.

4579
03:28:07,210 --> 03:28:08,250
Yeah, keep cranking it.

4580
03:28:08,350 --> 03:28:09,070
Keep cranking it.

4581
03:28:09,170 --> 03:28:09,670
It's not going backwards.

4582
03:28:09,970 --> 03:28:10,150
Okay.

4583
03:28:12,610 --> 03:28:13,510
We're good!

4584
03:28:14,310 --> 03:28:15,030
I made it!

4585
03:28:15,230 --> 03:28:15,230
Yay!

4586
03:28:15,610 --> 03:28:16,630
Can I stop cranking?

4587
03:28:16,710 --> 03:28:19,470
Yep, you can stop cranking.

4588
03:28:20,650 --> 03:28:20,950
Go!

4589
03:28:21,910 --> 03:28:22,430
Woohoo!

4590
03:28:23,990 --> 03:28:26,130
Minimal damage, minimal damage.

4591
03:28:26,990 --> 03:28:27,350
Yeah!

4592
03:28:27,810 --> 03:28:29,370
Yeah, it's pretty good there.

4593
03:28:30,950 --> 03:28:31,230
Yeah!

4594
03:28:32,750 --> 03:28:34,050
Maybe I'm just meant for that.

4595
03:28:34,170 --> 03:28:34,550
Cranking.

4596
03:28:34,850 --> 03:28:35,570
I was pretty good at that.

4597
03:28:35,690 --> 03:28:35,950
Yeah.

4598
03:28:36,090 --> 03:28:36,830
Pressing one button.

4599
03:28:37,090 --> 03:28:37,730
Okay, nice.

4600
03:28:37,950 --> 03:28:39,190
The queen of cranking.

4601
03:28:39,470 --> 03:28:40,510
The queen of cranking.

4602
03:28:40,510 --> 03:28:41,050
I don't know.

4603
03:28:41,430 --> 03:28:44,590
I think that was you, Phoebe, because you were- you couldn't
stop earlier.

4604
03:28:47,790 --> 03:28:48,670
I remember.

4605
03:28:50,930 --> 03:28:51,370
Wait,

4606
03:28:56,160 --> 03:28:58,260
it was- you- I was diseased.

4607
03:28:58,500 --> 03:28:59,500
Dis-eeased?

4608
03:29:00,160 --> 03:29:00,600
What?

4609
03:29:01,200 --> 03:29:01,640
Yes.

4610
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:04,840
I miss our moose.

4611
03:29:04,840 --> 03:29:07,000
I think we need to repair some windows up in here.

4612
03:29:08,100 --> 03:29:09,140
I miss our moose.

4613
03:29:11,140 --> 03:29:11,900
Yeah, same.

4614
03:29:11,980 --> 03:29:13,300
Maybe we should have taken him with us.

4615
03:29:15,600 --> 03:29:17,040
Let's see where we go next.

4616
03:29:20,800 --> 03:29:21,140
Oh.

4617
03:29:22,520 --> 03:29:22,660
Repair?

4618
03:29:23,080 --> 03:29:23,840
I think so.

4619
03:29:24,040 --> 03:29:24,800
Good, good, good.

4620
03:29:25,640 --> 03:29:27,440
What are you, what have you seen?

4621
03:29:29,500 --> 03:29:30,360
What's it look like?

4622
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:31,740
Take a look.

4623
03:29:35,220 --> 03:29:36,780
I can't see anything.

4624
03:29:37,020 --> 03:29:37,660
I know, are we?

4625
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,000
It's so terrible.

4626
03:29:38,120 --> 03:29:38,600
Here you go.

4627
03:29:42,500 --> 03:29:43,580
I've never seen the map.

4628
03:29:43,680 --> 03:29:43,980
Can I look?

4629
03:29:44,040 --> 03:29:44,560
Yeah.

4630
03:29:45,540 --> 03:29:46,280
Yes, yeah.

4631
03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:48,000
Thank you.

4632
03:29:50,900 --> 03:29:51,380
Look.

4633
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:53,040
For now, I'm going to start going forward.

4634
03:29:53,360 --> 03:29:54,320
Okay, we're there.

4635
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:54,980
Now, now?

4636
03:29:55,180 --> 03:29:55,420
Okay.

4637
03:29:56,780 --> 03:29:58,640
Are we meant to be...

4638
03:29:58,820 --> 03:30:01,320
Surely we're not heading into that black hole, right?

4639
03:30:01,720 --> 03:30:02,520
Oh, my gosh.

4640
03:30:02,560 --> 03:30:03,980
Do we have to jump across a ravine?

4641
03:30:05,800 --> 03:30:07,000
Oh, boy.

4642
03:30:08,800 --> 03:30:09,280
Okay.

4643
03:30:11,780 --> 03:30:12,640
All right, then.

4644
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:16,440
Whoa, whoa.

4645
03:30:16,480 --> 03:30:17,480
I believe in us.

4646
03:30:18,180 --> 03:30:18,900
Yeah, be a leap.

4647
03:30:19,120 --> 03:30:21,440
It looks like that's going to be the case, probably.

4648
03:30:21,680 --> 03:30:22,520
I'm a bit scared.

4649
03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:26,320
No, to be fair, I believe in you guys to get done.

4650
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:27,900
If it's me, I don't believe.

4651
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:29,980
If it's one of you guys driving, you're going to be right.

4652
03:30:30,280 --> 03:30:31,340
How do you get over this?

4653
03:30:31,340 --> 03:30:32,980
I'm going to adjust that bridge for us.

4654
03:30:33,040 --> 03:30:34,120
Oh, okay.

4655
03:30:34,240 --> 03:30:34,740
Thank you.

4656
03:30:35,620 --> 03:30:36,380
Oh, no, the beers.

4657
03:30:36,620 --> 03:30:37,980
The beers are falling out like that.

4658
03:30:38,960 --> 03:30:39,720
Get that six pack.

4659
03:30:41,200 --> 03:30:42,480
Oops, I accidentally turned it off.

4660
03:30:42,600 --> 03:30:43,160
I didn't mean to do that.

4661
03:30:44,300 --> 03:30:47,320
Oh, it's just going on its own.

4662
03:30:48,740 --> 03:30:49,480
Yep, we made it.

4663
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:51,280
We made it somehow.

4664
03:30:52,100 --> 03:30:52,220
Yeah.

4665
03:30:53,060 --> 03:30:53,620
Are you in?

4666
03:30:55,560 --> 03:30:56,060
Not yet.

4667
03:30:56,340 --> 03:30:56,580
Okay.

4668
03:30:57,100 --> 03:30:57,620
Wait, hold on.

4669
03:30:57,760 --> 03:30:59,320
Can I see the map real quick?

4670
03:31:03,320 --> 03:31:04,720
I am too short.

4671
03:31:04,880 --> 03:31:05,960
Can someone give me a lift?

4672
03:31:06,580 --> 03:31:08,240
Where did the map go?

4673
03:31:08,360 --> 03:31:09,120
Where did the map go?

4674
03:31:09,500 --> 03:31:10,160
Oh, there it is.

4675
03:31:10,540 --> 03:31:11,080
Don't worry, don't worry.

4676
03:31:11,200 --> 03:31:12,000
I see it.

4677
03:31:12,040 --> 03:31:13,900
Give me two seconds.

4678
03:31:14,040 --> 03:31:14,480
Yeah?

4679
03:31:15,160 --> 03:31:15,740
I'm giving them?

4680
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:16,600
It won't let me...

4681
03:31:16,600 --> 03:31:17,700
Okay, drop the winch pole.

4682
03:31:17,900 --> 03:31:18,420
There's the map.

4683
03:31:18,960 --> 03:31:19,600
Oh, I see it.

4684
03:31:19,780 --> 03:31:21,500
It's combined into the floor.

4685
03:31:21,860 --> 03:31:22,180
Okay, there you go.

4686
03:31:22,380 --> 03:31:22,780
Thank you.

4687
03:31:25,100 --> 03:31:28,180
Oh, this is a little bit more windy than I expected.

4688
03:31:28,860 --> 03:31:29,900
Okay, you can go, Phoebe.

4689
03:31:30,320 --> 03:31:31,520
I'm going to go forward a little bit.

4690
03:31:31,540 --> 03:31:32,420
Yeah, go for it.

4691
03:31:36,300 --> 03:31:38,860
I'm looking at us on the road.

4692
03:31:39,940 --> 03:31:42,380
I'm looking at us on the road.

4693
03:31:46,620 --> 03:31:48,120
To the rock, to the ride.

4694
03:31:49,780 --> 03:31:51,220
Okay, wait, get on, bro.

4695
03:31:51,580 --> 03:31:55,080
Does anyone know what any other part of that song?

4696
03:31:56,080 --> 03:31:56,860
Wait, there's a fork.

4697
03:31:57,220 --> 03:31:57,840
There's a fork here.

4698
03:31:57,840 --> 03:31:58,180
What was that?

4699
03:31:59,120 --> 03:31:59,800
I have no idea.

4700
03:32:00,460 --> 03:32:01,800
Oh, wait.

4701
03:32:04,960 --> 03:32:06,460

4702
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:09,060
Yeah, I'll go to the left.

Okay, I'll go to the right.

4704
03:32:11,400 --> 03:32:12,120
You're going to the right?

4705
03:32:12,340 --> 03:32:13,460
Okay, I'll go to the left.

4706
03:32:14,960 --> 03:32:15,540

Be brave.

4724
03:33:30,980 --> 03:33:33,000
You know, you're also kind of going to the car.

4725
03:33:35,740 --> 03:33:37,080
Are you okay, Vicky?

4726
03:33:37,320 --> 03:33:37,460
He's gone.

4727
03:33:37,500 --> 03:33:37,780
He's gone.

4728
03:33:38,340 --> 03:33:38,620
He's gone.

4729
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:38,880
He's gone.

4730
03:33:39,260 --> 03:33:39,480
He's gone.

4731
03:33:39,580 --> 03:33:39,960
Oh, okay.

4732
03:33:40,240 --> 03:33:40,680

03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:41,280
He's gone.

4734
03:33:41,900 --> 03:33:41,900
Oh, thank goodness.

4735
03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:42,300
Wow.

4736
03:33:42,900 --> 03:33:44,460
Wow, you're so good at fighting bears.

4737
03:33:44,520 --> 03:33:44,900
I know.

4738
03:33:45,700 --> 03:33:46,180
Oh, whoa.

4739
03:33:46,380 --> 03:33:47,020
What just happened to me?

4740
03:33:47,060 --> 03:33:50,160
I've got, you know, I may not be the brains, but I'm the
brawns.

4741
03:33:50,380 --> 03:33:50,720
Yeah.

4742
03:33:51,080 --> 03:33:52,000
I'll fight a bear.

4743
03:33:52,280 --> 03:33:53,160
Me versus bear.

4744
03:33:53,380 --> 03:33:54,400
I'll win every time.

4745
03:33:54,420 --> 03:33:55,680
You guys want to see what I think is a mine?

4746
03:33:55,820 --> 03:33:57,120
Oh, yeah, I want to go see it.

4747
03:33:57,160 --> 03:33:57,900
I think...

4748
03:33:57,900 --> 03:33:58,820
Yeah, where's that?

4749
03:34:00,540 --> 03:34:01,640
On this right side?

4750
03:34:01,680 --> 03:34:02,040
Oh.

4751
03:34:02,760 --> 03:34:03,400
I'll push it.

4752
03:34:05,140 --> 03:34:05,540
Ah!

4753
03:34:07,860 --> 03:34:08,260
Ah!

4754
03:34:09,220 --> 03:34:09,580
Oh.

4755
03:34:11,120 --> 03:34:11,520
It...

4756
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:12,020
Oh.

4757
03:34:13,080 --> 03:34:13,480
It...

4758
03:34:14,260 --> 03:34:14,600
Yeah?

4759
03:34:14,760 --> 03:34:15,120
Pinto.

4760
03:34:16,940 --> 03:34:17,880
Are you alive?

4761
03:34:18,880 --> 03:34:19,080
Hi!

4762
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:21,600
Minto?

4763
03:34:22,340 --> 03:34:22,460
Where?

4764
03:34:23,300 --> 03:34:23,780
Minto?

4765
03:34:24,240 --> 03:34:24,720
Oh, Minto!

4766
03:34:25,360 --> 03:34:25,980
You're alive!

4767
03:34:26,300 --> 03:34:26,640
Hi!

4768
03:34:27,120 --> 03:34:27,420
Yay!

4769
03:34:27,560 --> 03:34:28,400
It was, though!

4770
03:34:28,840 --> 03:34:29,180
Hi!

4771
03:34:29,420 --> 03:34:31,060
Yeah, we got rid of that pesky thing.

4772
03:34:32,100 --> 03:34:35,220
Oh, guys, that's what we used the cream for!

4773
03:34:35,840 --> 03:34:36,120
Yeah!

4774
03:34:36,420 --> 03:34:38,560
You guys got fire damage now, the explosion.

4775
03:34:38,680 --> 03:34:40,800
A little bit, yeah, a little bit.

4776
03:34:41,040 --> 03:34:42,780
Oh, wait, there's another one over here, be careful.

4777
03:34:42,860 --> 03:34:43,520
Look at the lift.

4778
03:34:43,840 --> 03:34:45,360
Wait, do we have that bouncy ball?

4779
03:34:47,740 --> 03:34:56,160
you're so right you're so big i think you threw it out of
the van like 30 minutes ago from what i remember okay but

4780
03:34:56,160 --> 03:35:07,920
what if we just like narrow hodo so we make a platform and
then narrow and then we then we lift it up so we make we

4781
03:35:07,920 --> 03:35:11,780
make a platform that's that's blooming difficult

4782
03:35:17,260 --> 03:35:18,380
It's really gonna work.

4783
03:35:19,920 --> 03:35:21,240
Bro, I don't think there's gonna...

4784
03:35:21,240 --> 03:35:21,720
Oh, lotion.

4785
03:35:23,140 --> 03:35:25,000
It's not long enough.

4786
03:35:25,720 --> 03:35:27,580
Are you guys pretty badly burned?

4787
03:35:29,920 --> 03:35:30,980
Like, half my health buff.

4788
03:35:30,980 --> 03:35:32,140
Oh, only a little bit burned.

4789
03:35:33,360 --> 03:35:34,220
I'm gonna eat some.

4790
03:35:35,340 --> 03:35:36,320
Go for it.

4791
03:35:36,540 --> 03:35:37,160
Eat it.

4792
03:35:38,080 --> 03:35:40,020
Oh, it, like, gets rid of so much.

4793
03:35:40,500 --> 03:35:41,160
It's pretty good.

4794
03:35:42,500 --> 03:35:44,920
There's, uh, one other lotion for someone.

4795
03:35:45,020 --> 03:35:45,840
I'm pretty sure you ain't eating that lotion, though.

4796
03:35:47,260 --> 03:35:48,020
Thank you.

4797
03:35:48,760 --> 03:35:50,840
It rubs the lotion on its skin.

4798
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:52,940
Or else it gets dead.

4799
03:35:53,160 --> 03:35:53,260
Oh!

4800
03:35:53,680 --> 03:35:54,120
What?

4801
03:35:55,140 --> 03:35:55,500
Uh...

4802
03:35:55,500 --> 03:35:56,080
Who was that?

4803
03:35:59,460 --> 03:35:59,740
Baby?

4804
03:35:59,880 --> 03:36:01,580
Something in front of you just exploded.

4805
03:36:03,960 --> 03:36:04,620
Where are you guys?

4806
03:36:04,640 --> 03:36:05,640
I dropped the plank on it.

4807
03:36:06,040 --> 03:36:06,660
Oh, nice.

4808
03:36:06,820 --> 03:36:08,160
Oh, there's one right behind you too.

4809
03:36:08,280 --> 03:36:09,200
Can we pick these up?

4810
03:36:12,360 --> 03:36:12,840
No.

4811
03:36:13,340 --> 03:36:13,820
Who's...

4812
03:36:13,820 --> 03:36:17,280
Who's leaving mines in this peaceful...

4813
03:36:17,280 --> 03:36:18,500
Yeah, I don't know.

4814
03:36:18,780 --> 03:36:19,260
Oh.

4815
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:20,360
Yeah.

4816
03:36:22,760 --> 03:36:25,200
What if I drop the one on this one too?

4817
03:36:25,880 --> 03:36:26,920
Okay, back up everybody.

4818
03:36:27,580 --> 03:36:28,480
Oh, nice, nice.

4819
03:36:28,700 --> 03:36:29,260
Okay, I'm backing up.

4820
03:36:30,440 --> 03:36:30,800
Nice!

4821
03:36:34,380 --> 03:36:34,740
Good!

4822
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:36,140
Wait, I'm gonna do this one too.

4823
03:36:36,360 --> 03:36:37,720
I don't think...

4824
03:36:37,720 --> 03:36:40,060
I don't think the wooden planks are long enough.

4825
03:36:40,100 --> 03:36:41,160
Oh, maybe they are long enough.

4826
03:36:41,860 --> 03:36:43,240
Oh, I'm doing them the wrong way.

4827
03:36:43,360 --> 03:36:44,160
Okay, no, you're right.

4828
03:36:44,260 --> 03:36:44,460
You're right.

4829
03:36:44,560 --> 03:36:45,040
You're so right.

4830
03:36:46,100 --> 03:36:48,440
I was like, because I thought so too, I was like, there's no
way.

4831
03:36:48,760 --> 03:36:49,480
There's no way.

4832
03:36:50,140 --> 03:36:51,460
You're so right, Phoebe.

4833
03:36:52,540 --> 03:36:53,180
Oh, gosh.

4834
03:36:53,440 --> 03:36:54,980

03:40:08,470 --> 03:40:09,950
Do you want to go back down?

4926
03:40:10,110 --> 03:40:11,530
Well, I was going to say you could just take it.

03:40:20,310 --> 03:40:20,710
Oh, okay.

Now, hold up.

4938
03:40:23,210 --> 03:40:24,410
I'm further up than you.

4939
03:40:24,470 --> 03:40:24,930
Oh, there we go.

4940
03:40:25,190 --> 03:40:26,030
Oh, okay, okay.

4941
03:40:26,850 --> 03:40:27,930
Watch out for mines.

4942
03:40:29,590 --> 03:40:30,550
Hello, hello.

4943
03:40:30,690 --> 03:40:33,110
But there's like a little house at the top here it seems.

4944
03:40:33,250 --> 03:40:34,210
Oh, there is, yeah.

4945
03:40:35,410 --> 03:40:35,730
Yeah.

Bear free.

4947
03:40:38,470 --> 03:40:40,290
And some meat patties.

4948
03:40:41,250 --> 03:40:46,270
And some meat patties.

4949
03:40:46,270 --> 03:40:46,530
Another ball.

4950
03:40:48,430 --> 03:40:48,830
Yes.

4951
03:40:49,430 --> 03:40:51,270
Wait, there's a ton of meat patties here.

4952
03:40:51,370 --> 03:40:51,750
Why?

4953
03:40:54,370 --> 03:40:56,990
I don't like the look of this.

4954
03:40:59,450 --> 03:41:00,770
Yeah, this is quite bad.

4955
03:41:01,410 --> 03:41:03,850
Oh, I think this might be the thing.

4956
03:41:03,870 --> 03:41:05,590
Yeah, this is the thing.

4957
03:41:06,210 --> 03:41:06,370
Oh, really?

Wait, I wouldn't!

4962
03:41:11,830 --> 03:41:12,470
I wouldn't!

4963
03:41:12,630 --> 03:41:13,630

4964
03:41:13,710 --> 03:41:14,470

Can I pee before this?

03:47:26,620 --> 03:47:27,500

Okay.

5074
03:47:28,040 --> 03:47:28,660
It's important.

5075
03:47:29,160 --> 03:47:32,620
There's going to be lots of nervousness going into the
ravine, but we can do this.

5076
03:47:32,720 --> 03:47:33,080
Yeah.

5077
03:47:33,220 --> 03:47:33,500
All right.

5078
03:47:33,520 --> 03:47:34,260
I'll be right back.

5079
03:47:35,800 --> 03:47:39,740
You've got to put your foot on the gas and change when
you're at full pelt.

5080
03:47:41,640 --> 03:47:43,560
135 is good downhill.

5081
03:47:45,980 --> 03:47:46,500
Okay.

5082
03:47:49,440 --> 03:47:52,280
Man, I hope your bears show up.

5083
03:47:52,880 --> 03:47:55,060
Bears will be the least of our worries, guys.

5084
03:47:55,320 --> 03:47:55,780
Thank you.

5085
03:47:55,960 --> 03:47:58,100
I like how Minta's just staring at me right now.

5086
03:48:00,240 --> 03:48:01,860
She's staring at you while peeing.

5087
03:48:05,600 --> 03:48:09,280
I like just the expression of like, if she's peeing as well.

5088
03:48:15,300 --> 03:48:17,300
Oh my god, Phoebe, I'm scared.

5089
03:48:18,140 --> 03:48:19,000
I'm scared.

5090
03:48:19,500 --> 03:48:21,700
Oh, thanks for the lucky, lucky spatchas, guys.

5091
03:48:22,060 --> 03:48:22,420
Thank you.

5092
03:48:22,640 --> 03:48:23,520
Thank you so much.

5093
03:48:23,660 --> 03:48:24,200
Thank you.

5094
03:48:24,340 --> 03:48:25,080
We feel the luck.

5095
03:48:25,300 --> 03:48:25,940
We feel it.

5096
03:48:26,780 --> 03:48:27,080
Thank you.

5097
03:48:30,140 --> 03:48:30,660
Okay.

5098
03:48:33,440 --> 03:48:35,900
What else can we do to prepare, Phoebe, do you think?

5099
03:48:36,240 --> 03:48:37,140
What else can we do to...

5100
03:48:38,080 --> 03:48:38,980
We could...

5101
03:48:38,980 --> 03:48:42,000
We could prepare some snake and ocelot fanfiction.

5102
03:48:42,000 --> 03:48:44,140
We should prepare our last words.

5103
03:48:45,140 --> 03:48:45,860
Oh, okay.

5104
03:48:46,120 --> 03:48:46,940
Slightly different vibes.

5105
03:48:47,140 --> 03:48:47,960
But yeah, yeah, either.

5106
03:48:48,280 --> 03:48:49,220
Either sounds good.

5107
03:48:52,920 --> 03:48:53,940
You know what?

5108
03:48:53,980 --> 03:48:55,040
I think that would motivate her.

5109
03:48:55,280 --> 03:48:58,020
It'll be like a carrot on a stick, you know?

5110
03:48:58,380 --> 03:49:00,360
Kind of think you need to put a carrot on a stick for a
minute.

5111
03:49:00,620 --> 03:49:02,780
What kind of carrots will put on the stick?

5112
03:49:04,140 --> 03:49:04,860
Hello, Minto.

5113
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:05,380

5128
03:51:45,560 --> 03:51:56,120

the moose all along It's good Man I think it's telling us

5129
03:51:56,120 --> 03:52:02,420
not to abandon Our moose friend I think it's telling us to
take it with us I agree We need to take the moose with us

5130
03:52:02,440 --> 03:52:02,880
RV.

5131

Is it inside?

5132
03:52:04,400 --> 03:52:04,880
Yeah, it can.

5133
03:52:05,120 --> 03:52:06,900
You can't put it down, so I have to...

5134
03:52:06,900 --> 03:52:09,420
I can't hold anything else if we take the moves with us,
basically.

5135
03:52:09,440 --> 03:52:10,220
Oh, you can't put it down.

5136
03:52:11,020 --> 03:52:11,360
No.

5137
03:52:11,620 --> 03:52:13,660
So I just have to just hold it the whole time.

5138
03:52:13,700 --> 03:52:13,940
Oh.

5139
03:52:15,480 --> 03:52:18,740

Yeah, yeah.

5143
03:52:22,980 --> 03:52:23,680
It was.

5144
03:52:24,200 --> 03:52:25,300
It was the best.

5145
03:52:25,500 --> 03:52:26,260
It was so good.

5146
03:52:26,480 --> 03:52:27,560
It can go on the roof.

5147
03:52:27,700 --> 03:52:28,740
Are you going to tag it to the roof?

5148
03:52:28,840 --> 03:52:29,280
Oh, really?

5149
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:29,840
Wait, hang on.

5150
03:52:30,020 --> 03:52:31,600
Wait, did we lose all our stuff?

5151
03:52:31,740 --> 03:52:32,300
Choked a minute.

5152
03:52:32,440 --> 03:52:33,140
No, we're good.

5153
03:52:35,600 --> 03:52:36,760
Do I still have my hat?

5154
03:52:36,900 --> 03:52:37,400
Probably not, right?

5155
03:52:37,560 --> 03:52:37,880
No.

5156
03:52:39,760 --> 03:52:40,720
Oh, it's all right.

5157
03:52:41,240 --> 03:52:44,660
I had the brief experience of it.

5158
03:52:45,380 --> 03:52:45,600
Okay.

5159
03:52:49,220 --> 03:52:51,480
It won't let me climb up the top with the moose, though.

5160
03:52:51,760 --> 03:52:52,460
It's not letting me climb.

5161
03:52:52,540 --> 03:52:52,980
Oh, no, it is.

5162
03:52:53,040 --> 03:52:53,400
Okay, it is.

5163
03:52:53,420 --> 03:52:54,540
I'm just not very good at it.

5164
03:52:55,080 --> 03:52:55,660
You got this?

5165
03:52:57,040 --> 03:52:57,600
I've got this.

5166
03:52:57,700 --> 03:52:57,960
I've got this.

5167
03:52:58,080 --> 03:52:59,400
We're putting that moose on the top.

5168
03:52:59,640 --> 03:53:02,360
You know how, like, pirate ships have, like, mermaid statues
at the front?

5169
03:53:02,420 --> 03:53:03,640
There are some moose.

5170
03:53:04,480 --> 03:53:33,280
it across again with the moose yes that's so good let's go

up absence of moose who put that up

5173
03:53:56,580 --> 03:54:02,860
absence of moose very well may not have been him but i'm
gonna blame steiner for it

5174
03:54:06,040 --> 03:54:07,720
Why don't you tell us to bring the moose?

5175
03:54:14,550 --> 03:54:15,970
Yeah, we'll be naming the moose.

5176
03:54:17,670 --> 03:54:20,210
I think Absence of Moose is winning.

5177
03:54:21,350 --> 03:54:23,790
You want the name to be Absence of Moose?

5178
03:54:24,270 --> 03:54:26,450
You want the moose to be called Absence of Moose?

5179
03:54:32,500 --> 03:54:34,440
Um, Abbey for sure.

5180
03:54:34,620 --> 03:54:35,100
Abbey?

5181
03:54:35,420 --> 03:54:35,760
