00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,040
Hello.

2
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,140
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

3
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,940
Hi, hi, welcome in, welcome in, welcome in.

4
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,480
Hello.

5
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,780
Early stream.

6
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,020
I don't think there's any saxophone in this.

7
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,280
This is not...

8
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,200
I guess this is a type of jazz, maybe.

9
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,380
It could use.

10
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,040
Hold on, I have it right here.

11
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,040
That's my Taco Bell.

12
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,540
Hmm...

13
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,090
Oh, wait, we're done.

14
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,230
Why did it stop?

15
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,990
Why chat freeze?

16
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,890
Hold on, let me try and fix it.

17
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,730
And... Frozen!

18
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,380
There you go.

19
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,370
So talented.

20
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,230
Thank you.

21
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,250
I love mint.

22
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,350
I love denser to duck.exe.

23
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,430
I hope you'll all cover ice cream one day together.

24
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,650
Maybe.

25
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,370
Cry on tight.

26
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,450
Sayoi Naka!

27
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,670
Happy birthday.

28
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,500
My tip for the day.

29
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,000
Each more.

30
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,480
Each.

31
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,880
Eat more.

32
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,960
Crunch wraps or preeps.

33
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,020
That's what this is.

34
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Crunch wrap supreme is my lunch.

35
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,920
It's a crunch wrap supreme and it, it has a black bean.

36
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,100
A black bean one.

37
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,440
Yeah.

38
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,780
Jasmine toe is real.

39
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
You know what else is jazz?

40
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,460
Godot's theme.

41
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,800
Let me try it.

42
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,280
Any advice for this poor unprepared wish?

43
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,000
Hope you have a good stream.

44
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,360
Yes, good luck.

45
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,780
Show this, you know.

46
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,320
What does she know?

47
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,080
I know.

48
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,210
I know.

49
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,690
I'm going to cry.

50
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,110
Got the revenue, thank you.

51
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,350
I was trying to do it to, like, the beat of this, but then I got all messed up.

52
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:10,030
stuff can you chew into the mic you have a strange request thanks

53
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:39,930
minjo best advice one time i got lost coming home from school and i knew how to get home from the 7-eleven when i was walking i was like walking a really long time and the sun was starting to set and i was like man i really don't know where i am i Don't recognize this street at all!

54
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:48,170
And I went up to a lady who was on her front, in her yard, like at the front door.

55
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,150
And I went to her and I said, Anno, Sumi Masen!

56
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,910
And then I was like,

57
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,210
She was so shocked!

58
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,770
She was like, and she drove me there

59
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:40,190
it was awesome no I was really lost and my mom was so worried about me and she was like um where the hell were you me and I said oh my god I'm my goal my goal bye-bye and

60
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,510
I told the judge I watch Mint YouTube Phantom and they let me skip J.

61
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,410
Let's go.

62
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,810
Okay, well, I'm going to eat a little bit more.

63
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,690
I've been so...

64
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,010
You have a charmed life, Minky.

65
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,590
That's not even life.

66
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,650
I'm dead.

67
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,350
Yeah, that's a true story.

68
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,710
I have a bit of a headache.

69
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,290
And I think it's because...

70
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,230
of stress.

71
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,170
I took some medicine, but I'm also like, maybe it's because I also didn't eat.

72
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,650
So, yesterday was my birthday!

73
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,030
Could I get possibly a happy birthday from my favorite cosplay?

74
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,350
Oh, yeah!

75
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,410
Happy birthday!

76
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,210
Happy, happy birthday!

77
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,330
Happy birthday!

78
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,890
This game might not help with that.

79
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,950
Alright, let's go.

80
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,350
I should be good after this, but...

81
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,740
I need a napkin.

82
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,850
Let's play the game.

83
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,350
because I have, oh, sorry, I'm still on the the displays or the options.

84
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,210
I have two streams today, so we'll be writing into my second stream, probably maybe back to back.

85
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,210
So, cool!

86
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:30,330
Double Minky, Double Minky, but in the next one it'll be a collab, so it'll be a little more difficult for me to like talk to you guys, so I was like, oh, I have too much to yap!

87
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,170
So let's start this game, baby.

88
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,860
Oh,

89
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,290
Why are they speaking in English though?

90
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,550
Are we at Narita or we at Taneda?

91
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,430
Whoa!

92
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,810
Oh my gosh, it's a person!

93
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,830
Wait, this is what I've always wanted to do!

94
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,710
I've always wanted to be in a suitcase!

95
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,090
Because it's po-

96
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,440
I have to be careful about how I wiggle.

97
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,780
Whoa!

98
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,670
They wouldn't do...

99
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,560
Would they do that though?

100
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,890
Would they like notice that you're a person in there and then...

101
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,700
steal you?

102
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,900
The intro is very stylish.

103
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,160
This is so like...

104
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,190
It reminds me of like a...

105
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,240
How do you say?

106
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,580
Like an old jazzy cartoon.

107
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Like a spy cartoon.

108
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,840
They get scanned!

109
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,640
They would know I'm in there!

110
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Oh my god, bird strike!

111
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Wait, actually!

112
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,090
They don't pressurize the cabin hold.

113
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,690
Oh, it's okay.

114
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,930
I'm already goo, so...

115
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:13,030
Oh, I don't want to

116
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,880
like close my eyes and just jam, but I want to keep watching too.

117
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,380
Wow!

118
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,080
This is cool.

119
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,840
Whoa, my sensitivity...

120
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,020
Did they... Wait, whoa, whoa, the sensitivity is like actually insane.

121
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,640
Hold on.

122
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,940
Controls?

123
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,120
Input?

124
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,980
Oh, here we go, here we go.

125
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,600
Now sensitivity.

126
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Like half that.

127
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,420
A little bit more.

128
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,320
A little bit more.

129
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,900
1,000 times sensitivity.

130
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,040
What if I...

131
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,840
That wasn't even full sensitivity.

132
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,650
Let's see what full is.

133
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,070
Holy cow.

134
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,170
Okay, I'm trying to look forward.

135
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,170
Only a psychopath would play like this.

136
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,110
Oh my gosh.

137
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,710
I'm even going to turn it down even more.

138
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,030
And like, turn off some of the smoothing.

139
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:23,950
Oh, whoops.

140
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,080
Ah!

141
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,320
This feels good.

142
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,100
This feels good.

143
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,640
It's never excited to watch you!

144
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,000
32 debut this friday today's also my birthday happy birthday

145
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:48,080

146
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,640
darlington who this original turning finances are

147
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,240
Just a box.

148
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,880
Just a box.

149
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,900
Import, export.

150
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,080
Can I run?

151
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh, what about you?

152
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,280
Are you just a box, too?

153
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,360
This one looks like a bomb.

154
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,700
Brooker and Brewster.

155
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,600
Velocipede.

156
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,640
What the heck is that?

157
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,660
More boxes.

158
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,020
Why is there an office in the subway?

159
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,400
Wait.

160
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,080
Down, honey.

161
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,660
The director will be right with you.

162
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,100
Oh, are there subtitles?

163
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,640
One second.

164
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,820
Sorry, I keep clicking objectives.

165
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,760
Display.

166
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,300
No.

167
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,240
Input.

168
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:53,880
Control.

169
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,740
I like how it says joystick one, button one, but I'm not using

170
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
Sorry, but there's none, it seems.

171
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,620
They are always on.

172
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,500
Yes, but no.

173
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Okay.

174
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,420
Subtitles are part of the game.

175
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,880
Okay, well maybe she's not important enough.

176
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,740
She's Secretary the 9th.

177
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Yes?

178
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,660
So sorry.

179
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
Continue your work.

180
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,860
I'm just seeing what you've got going on.

181
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,820
She's typing math!

182
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,620
Oh my god.

183
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,740
God, we have Einstein over here.

184
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,640
What is going on?

185
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,320

192

Please call Mr. Livermore.

193
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,660
Why is everything...

194
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,180
Why are we...

195
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Are we in Japan?

196
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,080
Hello to my tiny little mini and precious minto.

197
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,680
Paiso.

198
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,180
We're in jazz pan.

199
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,720
Marzipan?

200
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,420
Maybe.

201
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,260
How do you say it?

202
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,700
Paiso.

203
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,060
And then someone's selling their car.

204
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,260
This is manual.

205
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,680
You guys know how to drive manual.

206
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:39,960
Wait.

207
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,640
Yeah, you know how to drive manual?

208
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,860
It's like Piazzo.

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,160
Oh.

210
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,880
Piazzo.

211
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
Only Americans don't.

212
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,120
Why?

213
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,080
That's not true.

214
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,140
It's normal to drive manual here.

215
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,620
Really?

216
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,580
Where are you?

217
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,260
Okay.

218
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,730

219
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,230

225
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,650

226
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,450

227
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,610

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,270
Wait, hold on.

230
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,150

237
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,470
Okay.

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280

Am I a spy?

244
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,740
Basically, we need you to infiltrate the Soviet Consulate.

245
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,260
He doesn't even say anything about it.

246
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,860
They've taken some of our important technology, and it's imperative that we get it back on the right hand.

247
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,720
Is he gonna look at it?

248
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,860
As per usual, here's your mission or subscription.

249
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,320
Don't take too many.

250
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:09,960
Okay.

251
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,620
If you need me, I'll be in the wine cellar.

252
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,980

Oh, what the hell?

256
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,800
There's no stairs.

257
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,160
Oh.

258
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,420
Okay.

259
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,600
We're going?

260
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,260
Exciting!

261
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,640
Oh, infiltrate the Soviet consulate!

262
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,380
What's over here?

263
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,220
Hello?

264
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,760
Are you also infiltrating?

265
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,800
Believe in yourself.

266
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,820
Why are the people...

267
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,820
The cars are crazy.

268
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,040
Everything's crazy.

269
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,660
Believe in me.

270
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,520
Oh my god, I can't...

271
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,900
Sorry I haven't been around as much.

272
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,460
I'm going to congratulate you on this too.

273
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,960
Dang, it might die so fast.

274
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,850
It's all about the jazz, man.

275
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,570
Oh, he could take his money.

276
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,110
I'm not going to do that.

277
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,890
He's doing a good job.

278
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,110
What's this?

279
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,910
Jazz punk.

280
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,330
Wait, I'll take that.

281
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,810
I'll take that home with me.

282
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,370
Never mind.

283
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,910
I'll calibrate your sunset for a dollar.

284
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,070
Just a dollar?

285
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,230
Am I turning you on?

286
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,850
I reboot when I want.

287
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,330
You know, I tried online dating, but I couldn't find it in a penis match.

288
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,430
A what?

289
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,230
There were no subs- but a what?

290
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,130
Oh, you.

291
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,450
Only if you're using crypto.

292
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:38,870
I swear my animals raised for 10,000 volts.

293
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,760
What's this guy?

294
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:44,760
Psst.

295
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,240
Take this degausser.

296
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,200
Use it to scramble three carrier frequency pigeons.

297
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Hit each pigeon three times in order to degauss it.

298
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
Three... what?

299
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,420
I'm already so...

300
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,780
Ha.

301
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,860
I'm already so ha.

302
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,020
Ha.

303
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,200
Hello?

304
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,300
I need to find a pit- You're the 1,032nd player to inspect the garbage!

305
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,040
Okay!

306
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,960
I gotta blast some pigeons.

307
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh!

308
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,440
My fist?

309
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,620
My very hairy fist.

310
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:27,980
No one's held.

311
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,040
How's the audio, by the way?

312
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm pretty sure he stole my laptop.

313
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,160
No, I didn't.

314
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,180
I don't even know who you are.

315
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,140
Oh, I got Pax's piece of crap.

316
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,720
Why is he...

317
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,400
Bruce, sorry, sorry, sorry, I stole my laptop.

318
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,140
You gotta get your own peanut butter.

319
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,020
Okay.

320
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,260
It's a pizza code.

321
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,480
Chose, think pizza.

322
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,600
Pizza initiated.

323
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,200
Oh, oh my god.

324
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm playing another game suddenly.

325
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm playing a pizza game.

326
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
What is happening?

327
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,140
Is this pizza zombie?

328
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,800
Ah!

329
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,820
I think so.

330
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,300
Oh, how old Joe?

331
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,640
Oh my god.

332
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,380
Suddenly I'm playing another game.

333
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,820
He's...

334
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,580
He's not feeling very good, huh?

335
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,620
What's this one?

336
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,540
Dual wielding!

337
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,880
Oh, ow!

338
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,760
Oh.

339
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,100
Oh my god.

340
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,300
Oh my god, oh my god, it's horrible.

341
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,140
It's horrible.

342
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,860
Wait, why don't they die?

343
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,280
That guy is still rolling around.

344
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,880
There he goes.

345
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,720
Slender punk eight slices.

346
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,960
Why am I suddenly playing pizza game?

347
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,100
Oh my god, the clouds are Butchroop!

348
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,800
Why is the floor pizza?

349
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,860
Guy Savage.

350
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,360
Wish I said we're this good.

351
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,320
What are these?

352
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,680
That's not part of my pizza.

353
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,820
I'll kill you.

354
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,420
Ouch, ouch.

355
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,100
Can I die on this?

356
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,440
I wonder.

357
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,300
Oh my god.

358
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm trying to slice and dice you.

359
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,540
Okay, it's not like a...

360
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,220
What's the word?

361
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,760
It's not a, if I hold down click, it just automatically, you know.

362
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

363
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,940
Ouch, there we go.

364
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,820
Is that kiwi?

365
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,740
I've put kiwi on pizza before.

366
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,660
Curious.

367
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,860
Not many people have done that, I think.

368
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,520
This looks like a secret.

369
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,120
Oh.

370
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,420
A fish.

371
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,820
All work and no playbook.

Okay, I got one pigeon!

376
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:05,640
Hello.

377
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,060
Can I interest you in the stick of cotton?

378
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:07,700
Yes.

379
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,470
Did it drop something?

380
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,170
I'm not sure.

381
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:14,570
Oh.

382
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,210
My eyes.

383
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:15,970
Oh.

384
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,750
Oh my god.

385
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:18,570
No!

386
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,170
Oh my god, he's dodging him.

387
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,270
He's so talented.

388
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,710
Never punished.

389
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,170
Oh my god.

390
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,110
How is he still...

391
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,670
How is it?

392
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,450
He might be the luckiest guy ever.

393
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,870
Get up, sir!

394
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,430
Get up!

395
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,470
Oh my god, he might be the luckiest guy ever.

396
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:42,850
Oh my god!

397
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,650
He's nearly escaping death on every...

398
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:47,890
Wait,

399
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,520
don't go back the other way.

400
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,640
Oh, geez.

401
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,580
Okay, wait.

402
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,820
Hold on, I'm gonna go see if that bird dropped something.

403
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,590
I wish I could turn down them.

404
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,830
Oh, it did.

405
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:08,890
Oh!

406
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,770
Ooh, dipid pigeon.

407
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,590
How are you so loud?

408
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,250
Seriously.

409
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,850
Oh, get me out of here.

410
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,490
Get a jab.

411
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:26,810
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,270
Did I say it's 2,500 yen for a newspaper?

413
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,790
Everybody talks.

414
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,020
Okay.

415
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,740
I did notice this.

416
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,860
thought we were going to pick it up.

417
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,520
I didn't think it would be used for murder.

418
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,000
It's just in the middle of the road.

419
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,920
Maybe I'm trying to kill all my...

420
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,880
Okay.

421
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Yeah!

422
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,520
I really didn't notice that I dropped something before.

423
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,080
Thanks, guys.

424
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,340
Do I have something on my face?

425
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,520
Oh.

426
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:12,860
Yes?

427
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,360
Oh, my God.

428
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,120
Why do I feel like I'm playing like a modern version of that...

429
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,020
possible quiz game.

430
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,440
Okay, I love you.

431
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Bye-bye.

432
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,260
Well done.

433
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,220
I can't do it anymore, you guys.

434
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,920
I can't do it.

435
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
There is no sound option.

436
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,680
That's fine.

437
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,180
We got more Ode to Pigeon.

438
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,660
What are you doing?

439
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,680
Do you have the MacGuffin?

440
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,560
A whata?

441
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,400
Come back when you've got the MacGuffin.

442
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,060
Okay.

443
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,600
Who's just playing music?

444
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,500
The president steps down onto the ground after descending the ladder.

445
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,660
The McMuffin.

446
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,020

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,620

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,250
Temporal shifting decriminalized.

454
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,330
Time heads celebrate by going back in time.

455
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,670
Mega Corp CEO declares Uno.

456
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,570
Oh no, he's gonna win the game!

457
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,550
We still haven't even checked out the other side of the street.

458
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,990
Alright, our informant was this guy over here, no?

You're welcome.

462
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,840
This is my Mima's secret pigeon pot pie recipe.

463
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,160
Oh!

464
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,800

465
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,740
Don't hurt it!

466
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,000
Please wait while they bake.

467
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,240
Just like Mewa I used to make.

468
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,580
I have fourth degree burns all over my entire face.

469
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,020
Skeleton, thank you!

470

473
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:17,760
Aw.

474
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,480
Wait, what if I...

475
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,660
Oh, I have no more stuff anymore.

476
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,860
You don't know me?

477
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,900
You don't know me?

478
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,840
What's my name?

479
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,720
Okay, but only if you use polarity protection.

480
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,320
Her name is...

481
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,300
My wife.

482
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,220
Condemned due to swan infestation.

483
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,920
This place is bizarre, isn't it?

484
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,040
I don't

485
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,830
know.

486
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,730
I just get ball.

487
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,150
Oh.

488
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,630
Can I do anything with it?

489
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:00,930
No?

490
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,250
Oh.

491
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:02,890
That's not.

492
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,650
Bop, bop.

493
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,570
What's going on here?

494
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,990
I'm investigating trash again.

495
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,250
Wait?

496
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,510
Extra strength plus C-backs.

497
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,610
Oh, I drank it.

498
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,210
Oh, my God.

499
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,370
Never take Plessy Bex after taking Mission Oil.

500
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,330
Uh-oh.

501
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,870
Wait, I didn't mean to!

502
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,410
I didn't mean to take it!

503
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,750
I think the game didn't like...

504
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,230
I think I messed up.

505
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,230
Let me go back there.

506
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,330
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

507
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,290
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

508
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,050
Boooo.

509
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,630
Boooo.

510
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,850
Boooo.

511
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:53,850
Ah,

512
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,490
let's talk to three inanimate cardboard boxes.

513
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,370
The Metal Gearhead and me has to.

514
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,730
The path you walk has no end.

515
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,550
Each step you take is paved with the corpses of your enemies.

516
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,090
Their souls will haunt you forever.

517
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,590
You shall have no peace.

518
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,230
Hear me, snake.

519
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,650
My spirit will be watching you, covered in pigeons.

520
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,150
for salmon spawning season.

521
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,910
Ah!

522
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,250
Don't scare me!

523
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,890
Oh, he's yelling, he's like, aw.

524
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:40,850
Ah.

525
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,150
Ah.

526
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,250
Ah.

527
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,490
Ah.

528
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,470
Ah.

529
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,050
Into the street you go, into the street.

530
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:11,600
It's like it's like I turned into a high school bully a sound oh I just ate this the trash sandwich It looked perfectly fine though.

531
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:31,840
I think Fish and chips Hello, my name is Johnny to Johnny to hello my mother never thought me to speak and smell She's just consuming everything.

532
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,840
I can't stop!

533
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,820
I'm so hungry!

534
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,940
I got an idea.

535
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,940
What's that?

536
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,400
Push this button.

537
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,780
He said push this button but the subtitle says pull my finger.

538
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,880
Johnny!

539
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,420

540
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,660
Oh my gosh.

Don't scare me like that!

542
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,600
Good thing I have quicksave.

543
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,860
I'm superior to a trash can in almost every way.

544
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,800
I can modulate my voice all day long.

545
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,880
Why do you humans insist on including your epidermis?

546
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,220
Are you a person or an antelope?

547
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,440
I don't know anywhere.

548
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,360
I wish more people were like you.

549
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,740
I'm so...

550
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,440
Nice.

551
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,340
I think.

552
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,300
Creepy.

553
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Yeah, what's up?

554
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,560
Creepy.

555
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,720
Free Wi-Fi from Starbucks.

556
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,460
Creepy.

557
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,100
But I dropped my password cracker on the road.

558
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,340
I played Frogger!

559
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,800
Oh my god.

560
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,140
Oh my god.

561
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,680
Oh my god.

562
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,140
Oh!

563
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,500
It's okay.

564
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,320
We can go backwards.

565
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,300
Probably.

566
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,000
Do I have to come back?

567
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,480
Okay.

568
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,440
Oh shoot.

569
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,760
I made it.

570
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,630
How do you drop it there?

571
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,250
Probably took the shortcut, you know?

572
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,970
That was so stinking close.

573
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,070
Put it on.

574
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,370
Amphibian data visor!

575
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,690
I liked eight data packets to crack the network.

576
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,530
Oh my god.

577
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,310
I have no saliva.

578
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,150
Okay.

579
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,730
Is that a data cracker?

580
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,650
Oh, I see one.

581
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,110
Oh.

582
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,270
Then you.

583
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,320
I have four out of eight.

584
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:42,920
Oh, here's one.

585
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,320
Um...

586
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,240
Oh, here's one.

587
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,200
And one.

588
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,800
Password?

589
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,800
One more?

590
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,380
Gamers don't look up?

591
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,900
But I do.

592
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,420
Starbucks guest?

593
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,190
Alright, biggie.

594
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,200
Now a little privacy, please.

595
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,420
Oh my god.

596
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,460
What's he watching?

597
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,600
What is that?

598
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,570
What is it?

599
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,030
He's funny.

600
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,650
Privacy!

601
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,050
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

602
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,330
Oh, Titus, you came home!

603
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,890
Oh my gosh, it spooked me so loud.

604
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,710
Types that are fired!

605
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,130
And Nyak pleads insanity.

606
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,910
Can I go in here?

607
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,290
We specialize in laundering your stolen goods.

608
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,790
I think I should be able to go in there.

609
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,370
What about here?

610
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,710
I ate some.

611
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,890
Now I'm bursting with energy.

612
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,050
Oh, the fish and chips.

613
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,250
Customer reaction has been overwhelming.

614
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,890
I think Comic Sans is very...

615
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,790
Oh, this guy's stuck.

616
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:13,810
You're late.

617
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,590
Oh, I am.

618
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,450
Side quest.

619
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,130
I guess we could do a side quest, right?

620
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,450
What is this?

621
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,750
You find the mailbox marked with chalk on the side.

622
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,530
You will see further instructions from there.

623
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,330
Okay.

624
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,710
Yeah, the Geiger counter is kind of going insane.

625
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,830
Underwear and underwear.

626
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,230
No, wait.

627
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,390
We're everywhere and underwear.

628
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,730
I could tell you, but then I have to kill you.

629
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:38,950
Oh.

630
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,510
And then I have to resurrect you.

631
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,170
Locate the mailbox marked with chalk.

632
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,630
Mailbox marked with chalk.

633
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,110
Ah, ah, he goes MC Square.

634
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,350
There's a man in the park sitting on a bench.

635
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,990
Deliver this package to him.

636
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,110
Yes, sir.

637
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,570
Yes, sir.

638
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,550
Man, on the park.

639
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,030
I thought that was a person up there.

640
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,030
In the bench, on the bench.

641
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,890
Sitting on the bench.

642
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,810
Wait, which guy?

643
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,210
I think it has to be this one, right?

644
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,290
Or it's the unassuming guy.

645
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,390
Do you want this?

646
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,370
No.

647
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,850
Have a seat, but keep your eye.

648
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,010
Locate the newspaper box marked with a piece of chewing gum.

649
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,170
Newspaper box marked with chewing gum.

650
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:32,970
Yes, sir.

651
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,610
Can I just go in?

652
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,550
You know, I didn't even really think about it much.

653
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,150
I didn't try to infiltrate at all.

654
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,550
Feel lost, stuck in life?

655
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,970
Call the hint helpline.

656
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,590
We'll set you on the right path.

657
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,350
5-5-5 hint.

658
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,090
Nippon Telnet.

659
00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:05,610
5-5-5-5.

660
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:06,790
hint.

661
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,130
Workers take their lunch break at noon.

662
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,190
Oh.

663
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:12,890
Oh.

664
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,170
Oh.

665
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:13,370
Whoops.

666
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:13,770
My bad.

667
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:14,970
It's an actual hint.

668
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:15,730
Oh.

669
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,850
That's not my hand.

670
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,850
What am I doing?

671
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,490
What was it?

672
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,650
Look for the chewing gum.

673
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:36,860
Oh.

674
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,520
I was wondering if there was fall damage.

675
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,600
Oh, I know if it's marked in gum.

676
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,280
There's still shiny pig- No, Revenge of the Pigeon!

677
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,340
That's terrible.

678
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,340
Hello, Mint, please give me a hint.

679
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,160
Try again later.

680
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,180
Big boy.

681
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,100
Oh, here we go.

682
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,260
You're almost there, Agent.

683
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,560
Go to the Raytheon Motel.

684
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,540
Knock on the door using the secret knock.

685
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,760
Do not correctly, and you'll be led inside.

686
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,040
The what hotel?

687
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,620
The Raytheon Motel.

688
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,600
This one over here.

689
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,520
This is the one I tried knocking on before, I think.

690
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,260
Uh, here?

691
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:34,840
Yes.

692
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,120
Okay, we got this.

693
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh my gosh, peace and quiet.

694
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,480
Okay.

695
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,680
Watch this.

696
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,240
Wait, watch this.

697
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,380
Watch, watch, watch, mom.

698
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,060
Watch this.

699
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,480
It is later.

700
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,340
I'm here again.

701
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,680
Please, please, please.

702
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,040
Use this money to avoid your taxes.

703
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,680
Thanks.

704
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,040
Congratulations.

705
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:09,940
Thank you.

706
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,200

00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,140
Yeah?

708
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,340

What's going on here?

Movie theater?

717
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,720
The show is starting shortly.

718
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,930
Retirement is bliss.

719
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,310

Oh, my God.

I keep a go- they keep me a cigar!

723
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,290
It's a what?

724
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,390
It's a swing wing.

725
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,170
It's a wing wing.

726
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,930
Is this a real toy for this?

727
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,610
It's a what?

728
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,170
It's a swing wing.

729
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,170
It's the swing wing.

730
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,390
It's a swing wing.

731
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,710
Oh my god.

732
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,670
Just give your own kids shaking baby syndrome.

733
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,950
What is happening?

734
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,270
Oh my god.

735
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,680
A new thing.

736
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,320
It's the swing wing.

737
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,640
Get swing wing made by transagram where the fun comes from.

738
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,920
It's a swing wing.

739
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:52,900

Oh, what's happened?

746
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,140
Oh, I've been given...

747
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,120
They took my cigar!

748
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,580
I've been given...

749
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,200
Is this popcorn?

750
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,180
I don't really

751
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
care if you leave now.

752
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,020
You've already paid me an admission.

753
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,080
I mean, who stays for the real film anyway, right?

754
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,940
All right.

755
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,720
Well, we watched the movie.

756
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,200
Wait, can I see the movie?

757
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,580
If I go back in...

758
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,580
Oh, but no!

759
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,740
Get me out of here, please!

760
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,040
I should have known.

761
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,840
Weeks of fun, weeks of fun!

762
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,680
Lifetime of chiropractor bills.

763
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,920
It's the swing wing.

764
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,400
The girl's face kills me.

765
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,860
Get that away from that elephant!

766
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,940
I almost called him a dinosaur.

767
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,560
see his big thing and it's like dinosaur.

768
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,760
Okay, good.

769
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,700
We're back out.

770
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,800
It's the swing wing.

771
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,100
It is like a dinosaur, right?

772
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,020
Almost.

773
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,620
You're so small.

774
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,280
That was the movie.

775
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,080
Oh, gee.

776
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,800
A bootleg VHS.

777
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,940
Just for me.

778
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,380
What?

779
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,280
Pow.

780
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,860
I've been smoking since I was three.

781
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,220
Still no side effects.

782
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,180
I'm 34 years old.

783
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:50,340
Oh.

784
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,180
Pau.

785
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,140
Pau.

786
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,240
Pau.

787
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,000
I've been smoking since I was three.

788
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,140
Still no side effects.

789
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,600
Don't smoke, everybody.

790
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,500
Don't do it.

791
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,880
How many things do you call a dinosaur then?

792
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,640
Best friends forever.

793
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,610
Try to wear you sleep at night.

794
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,510
Oh, I don't like that.

795
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:32,990
response all right we're gonna infiltrate the soviet consulate right now it's not noon these guys are not on break but i might be able to go in i can just go inside

796
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:44,710
they're still fired they have the news is so slow hello i'm afraid you don't have appointment

797
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,500
I'm not sure what that did.

798
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,900
I'm sorry, I cannot allow you access.

799
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,660
What have we got in here?

800
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,000
Lunchtime, communist plotting, vodka and biscuits, potato sack rice.

801
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,500
You have insufficient security clearance.

802
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,720
Let me in.

803
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,540
Let me in.

804
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,280
I'm afraid I must ask you off premises.

805
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,200
So, it's actually quite late.

806
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,340
How do I restart the day then?

807
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,360
What is this?

808
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,760
What is that, dude?

809
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,180
Can you click the clock?

810
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,100
I tried, but let me try again.

811
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,780
Maybe we can, like, set it to...

812
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,360
Oh, where's to be going now?

813
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,220
Oh, I can!

814
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:57,780
I can!

815
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,400
I'm silly.

816
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,500
Noon exact.

817
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,210
Okay, oh, hello.

818
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:18,570
That's fine.

819
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,570
Gone luncheon.

820
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,010
Back in five minutes.

821
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,530
Okay, we only have five minutes, you guys.

822
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,310
We gotta get up there.

823
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,890
We gotta get in.

824
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,380
I'm just so curious what else we could do here, you know.

825
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,740
Okay, I'm infiltrating.

826
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,400
And three, two, one.

827
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,700
Oh, sick.

828
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,520
Okay.

829
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,620
What do I do now?

830
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,580
Um...

831
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,360
Oh my god, it's so loud every time.

832
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,020
Uneventful news day seizes a nation!

833
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,820
Moon explode!

834
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,120
That's...

835
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,220
Uneventful, of course.

836
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,340
Top secret.

837
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:02,440
Oh!

838
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,020
Oh my gosh.

839
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,760
Oh, oh, oh, don't...

840
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,060
Don't, don't, don't, don't do...

841
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,700
Don't do my...

842
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:18,930
Hi!

843
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:19,970
Hi!

844
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:20,470
Hi!

845
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,690
Oh my gosh.

846
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,090
There we go.

847
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:26,610
Oh.

848
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,490
I'm destroying my own thing.

849
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,150
Unless that's not my thing.

850
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:30,950
Who knows?

851
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:31,410
Wait.

852
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,760
There we go.

853
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,460
Defeat a microscopic squadron of buck...

854
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,940
Said something for sure.

855
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,160
There was text.

856
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,720
That was spoken.

857
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,660
This one's funky.

858
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,460
Wait, are they gonna mitosis in front of us?

859
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,120
Oh, hello.

860
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,600
Even he's got a cigarette.

861
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,320
Everyone, do be smoking.

862
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,900
Mainframe of the month.

863
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,820
Is this my disguise?

864
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,940
All I need is a human heart.

865
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,040
What were we trying to get in here again?

866
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:31,920
I can't remember.

867
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,800
There's so many noises.

868
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,000
What's happening here?

869
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:41,760
Whoa.

870
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:54,130
We have comrade crunch.

871
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,330
There's a whistle inside.

872
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,590
Stay communist even in the milk of a capitalist pig.

873
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:04,870
Wait, what does this do?

874
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,320
Okay.

875
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,820
The tone of...

876
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,010
Do I have to change it?

877
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,460
There's so many signals.

878
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,080
There's so many things.

879
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,260
The toy.

880
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:43,720
Oh, here.

881
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,700
Did it say 2600?

882
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,300
Ah!

883
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,600
It even...

884
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,840
It's like, hey, stupid.

885
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,430
No!

886
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,940
A dope pay-per-view?

887
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,890
Oh, and the direct-

888
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,680
I'm not a zoomer!

889
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,520
We maxed it!

890
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,460
One.

891
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,200
I want to call Satan.

892
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,980
Two.

893
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,360
Three.

894
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,800
A pie?

895
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,920
Okay, see you later.

896
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
See you girl.

897
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,760
Cool.

898
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,640
What else we got on here?

899
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:38,600
They

900
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,640
couldn't max it out again, right?

901
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,000
What do you say?

902
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,300
Okay, I think I got all the options, so...

903
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,300
Very cool.

904
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,260
Target acquired!

905
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,180
Very good.

906
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,860
What is this for?

907
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,200
It makes them sing.

908
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,940
What is this now?

909
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,040
Oh, oh.

910
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,220
Looks a little dangerous.

911
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,480
It's a booty enhancer!

912
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,280
From the radiation!

913
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,500
Oh, there's so many!

914
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,020
Why did it make like five copies?

915
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:50,740
Look!

916
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,170
Wait, can I put the employee?

917
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,850
Oh wait, no?

918
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,630
Interesting, okay.

919
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,370
There's so many sounds.

920
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,890
Wait, do I use his eye to get in here?

921
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,790
This guy.

922
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,360
Thanks.

923
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,280
All right, let's go.

924
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,420
Ice alarm or fire alarm?

925
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,870
Floor lubricant.

926
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,250
Whoa!

927
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:47,990
Whoa, it's really slippery guys, be careful.

928
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,530
Pull the ice alarm!

929
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,270
Wait, do these work?

930
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:54,690
Oh, no.

931
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:55,990
No.

932
00:57:58,790 --> 00:57:59,010
No.

933
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:00,630
Huh.

934
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,010
I think I pull it and then maybe go down the chute.

935
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:09,750
Whoa!

936
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,070
Wait, but this caught...

937
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,610
Oh, so it caused a fire.

938
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,590
Smuggle a carrier pigeon into the next level.

939
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:23,930
Oh, I'm here.

940
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,340
Eat your bread.

941
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,140
Nobody's eating it.

942
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,940
We arrived in Japan or something.

943
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,140
Welcome back.

944
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:41,700
No!

945
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,860
Our benefactors used to extend their grata to...

946
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,600
My bread!

947
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,240
I hope you're ready for another job.

948
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,480
There's a biotech engineer working for Rayfield Corps.

949
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,520
Inside connections seem to have afforded him a particularly valuable artificial kidney.

950
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,840
Estimated value on the red market is over 25 billion yen.

951
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,220
We need you to extract this from them at any cost.

952
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,680
Job carrying the carrier, thank you.

953
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,000
If it was, I know you'll do well by me.

954
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,380
Yep.

955
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,840
But if you don't mind, I've got a landline to install.

956
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,820
His shoes!

957
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
This is his favorite restaurant.

958
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,000
I actually... wait, this is such a cute design.

959
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,000
It's like a...

960
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,160
It's like a Manikineko, but it's also an octopus.

961
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,320
This game is...

962
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,400
Guys, I think this game might be a little goofy.

963
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,840
Let's take my meds.

964
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:46,780
Squid!

965
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:48,940
You know what I meant.

966
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,940
that's our target follow the cowboy okay

967
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:19,890
i don't like that that just happened to us i think that made me upset

968
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,580
What do they mean they make ropes?

969
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,500
Oh, hi.

970
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,880
Uh, what is this car?

971
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,620
Uh, what is this car?

972
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,920
Uh, go ahead.

973
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,340
This car?

974
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,000
Um, what is this car?

975
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:14,040
Well, nobody can say I didn't try it.

976
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,240
You know?

977
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,900
Oh, there he is.

978
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,820
I mean, there's a cigarette.

979
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,280
That's not him.

980
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,160
Watashi, very welcome.

981
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,740
Watashi has a cash.

982
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,560
Why you click on me?

983
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:39,780
Oh.

984
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,600
Why you click on me?

985
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,440
I'm just talking to you.

986
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,660
You could get the multivibrator.

987
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,320
Oh.

988
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,460
It's impolite to ask a lady her fun way.

989
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,700
I didn't ask.

990
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,480
How big is your creation mesh?

991
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,760
No instant messaging.

992
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,240
Kawarid.

993
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,760
Do you like me in kimono or kisario?

994
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,080
She sounds like me when I turn the...

995
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,360
Oh, wrong way.

996
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,780
The voice takes around.

997
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,480
Do you like me in...

998
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:28,630
Does this kimono make me look fat 32?

999
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,270
That's it.

1000
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,370
This came a little

1001
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,380
strange!

1002
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,400
Why?

1003
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,280
Like as hard as but low.

1004
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,620
I don't get it.

1005
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,220
Anyway.

1006
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,980
Whoa, what's here?

1007
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,660
Talk to me!

1008
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,240
Talk to me!

1009
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,260
Don't ignore me!

1010
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,200
What's in here?

1011
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:06,660
Oh!

1012
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,300
Virus.

1013
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:15,560
Oh!

1014
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,880
Oh!

1015
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,360
Uh-oh.

1016
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,320
Um, guys!

1017
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,100
Uh-oh.

1018
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,160
Kimono makes her look ex-fat.

1019
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,260
Is that a good thing?

1020
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:30,840
Is that guy peeing?

1021
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes?

1022
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,360
Take my advice.

1023
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:36,760
Yep.

1024
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,240
Never overclock your underwear.

1025
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,440
Can you spare my tea?

1026
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,820
I'd like to drink motor oil.

1027
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,660
Ah, the government.

1028
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:46,700
Ah, it's the government.

1029
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,160
Ah, the government.

1030
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,040
Ah, the government.

1031
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,880
Can you give me a nibble of that cookie?

1032
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,980
Ah, the government.

1033
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,200
Ah, the government.

1034
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,620
Is that guy throwing up?

1035
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,300
No, he's...

1036
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,500
Oh, he's eating it!

1037
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,420
And then he's gonna eat me!

1038
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,440
Oh my god!

1039
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,160
Oh, I thought it was a cup of tea, but it's just the latter floating in cyber space.

1040
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,080
race or something.

1041
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,580
Do not eat.

1042
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,180
Oh, I thought it was orange pico.

1043
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,380
It tastes like chalk.

1044
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,780
Sometimes I threw up things that I don't remember eating.

1045
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,200
So he, close enough, throwing up.

1046
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,780
Is he eating the rest of it?

1047
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,460
Oh my god.

1048
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,740
Ew, stop making noises behind me.

1049
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,400
Wait, was there anything around here?

1050
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,860
Can we go in here?

1051
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,220
No.

1052
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Yes?

1053
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,400
She was so polite about it.

1054
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,900
My thrash shop has been infested with vases.

1055
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,240
I mean, opposite of that.

1056
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,000
Sorry.

1057
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:55,620
Sorry.

1058
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,860
My thrash shop has been infested.

1059
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,460
Here we go.

1060
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,760
Oh, oh my god.

1061
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,180
Ah!

1062
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,300
But I'm...

1063
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:01,740
Oh my god.

1064
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,240
Don't knock over the vases, though.

1065
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,520
Oh my god.

1066
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,040
Wait, I can do this.

1067
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,560
I can do this.

1068
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,460
Yes!

1069
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,080
There's only like two in here.

1070
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,560
Wait, did I get it?

1071
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,320
Oh, I did, I did, okay.

1072
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1073
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:27,480
Oops.

1074
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,280
Oh, I did it!

1075
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,340
She didn't even get mad.

1076
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,700
She didn't care at all.

1077
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,140
At least I can cook these fries for dinner.

1078
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,920
Fry soup for everyone.

1079
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,140
She says, what she says and what she thinks are totally opposite.

1080
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,380
Did you know that?

1081
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,280
At least I can cook this rice for dinner.

1082
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,730
Is he saying rice soup for everyone?

1083
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,450
Yeah, you naughty fly.

1084
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,310
Yeah, I...

1085
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,290
Look at you.

1086
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,930
With your booty in the air.

1087
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,570
You stay down there.

1088
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,290
Oh, I have a fly's water now.

1089
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:16,730
Oh!

1090
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,030
Are they all?

1091
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,790
Okay, that guy's not a fly.

1092
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:35,870
What about you?

1093
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,070
They're all flies.

1094
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:50,170
Am I supposed to find all the fly people?

1095
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:53,630
Am I what?

1096
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,570
Am I what?

1097
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,750
Okay.

1098
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:04,330
Well, yeah, we're supposed to follow the cowboy, huh?

1099
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,050
Let's go find him.

1100
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:07,950
Soup desuio.

1101
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:12,710
Oh, oh!

1102
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,250
Excuse you.

1103
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,850
Milk.

1104
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:28,130
Oh, sorry.

1105
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:28,850
Can we talk?

1106
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,820
Really?

1107
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,180
Oh, hontoni.

1108
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,000
What's in here?

1109
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,800
Oh, this is where you call the hint, right?

1110
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,320
Okay, we don't need a hint, though.

1111
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:51,540
Not yet.

1112
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,380
I don't think I've lost.

1113
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,660
I haven't even explored it.

1114
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,280
YAMETE?

1115
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,000
What is your business here?

1116
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,320
Um...

1117
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,780
I'm being ultra-cawaii.

1118
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,700
I'm taking you in.

1119
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:03,640
Ah!

1120
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,180
Why?

1121
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,040
Stop resisting.

1122
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:08,580
Why?

1123
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,160
Let me get you with my fly's water!

1124
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,040
Why?

1125
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,020
Oh, my...

1126
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh, my God.

1127
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,900
Oh, I see.

1128
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,800
I became a wizard.

1129
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,290
How?

1130
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,650
How high can we get him?

1131
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:44,090
Yes!

1132
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:48,890
The force!

1133
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:50,770
Yes!

1134
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,430
I've had a cadaver!

1135
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,410
Did I win or...

1136
01:08:58,590 --> 01:08:59,930
Why do you take me in anyway?

1137
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,890
Wait, what am I supposed to do with these hands?

1138
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,410
What am I supposed to do with these hands?

1139
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,750
Oh.

1140
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,720
Leave them, I guess.

1141
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,400
What's here?

1142
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,340
Oh, oh, it's a sax!

1143
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,260
Oh my god, wait.

1144
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,060
There's gotta be...

1145
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,120
There's gotta be kazoo or something in here.

1146
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,940
I think we found everything, maybe.

1147
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,200
Oh, what's this?

1148
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,020
Okay, it's jazz.

1149
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,800
Jazz is not dead.

1150
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,540
What am I doing with...

1151
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,180
Oh, oh!

1152
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,460
He's bisoned bird purring.

1153
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,080

01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,930
It looks like a human?

1161
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,810
Oh, oh my gosh.

1162
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,490
It looks like the Metal Gear font.

1163
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:31,230
It looks like a Metal Gear.

1164
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,050
Wait, side quest.

1165
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:33,370

Okay.

1167
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,180
So is that a replicant?

1168
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,290
What the?

1169
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:52,670
It's two minutes from each go.

1170
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:56,330
Table for one, please.

1171
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:58,190
Mint ketchup.

1172
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,230
Could be Snatcher.

1173
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,290
Yeah, exactly.

1174
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:16,690
So the replicants, I'm guessing, they look like...

1175
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:18,810
Like this!

1176
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,310
Now how do I kill you?

1177
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,530
Whoa, freaky.

1178
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,930
Oh, replicant detected, yes!

1179
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:34,150
Oh, that wasn't so bad.

1180
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:36,970
Oh, he's retiring!

1181
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,070
Oh, sweet guy!

1182
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,130
Congratulations!

1183
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:42,730
Oh, what about you?

1184
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:43,670
I didn't see you even.

1185
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,930
Oh, that is a fish.

1186
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,130
Identification pilot.

1187
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,590
Wait, I do need to get closer.

1188
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:55,790
Okay,

1189
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,780

1190
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,080
The children laughing.

1191
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:17,860
Okay.

1192
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,080
Well, we found one.

1193
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,000
Those are my hands.

1194
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,660
They're just stuck there.

1195
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:27,980
Very cool.

1196
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:33,910
This gotta be one.

1197
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,230
A gold watch?

1198
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,890
I'm headed to the pawn shop.

1199
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:43,090
I'm headed to the pawn shop.

1200
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,050
Okay, that's two?

1201
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,550
You think it's the bird?

1202
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:53,600
Nah.

1203
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,900
Just a bird.

1204
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,300
A boar.

1205
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,640
A little boar.

1206
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,680
Wait, but everybody else was...

1207
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:02,780
Hmm.

1208
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,600
Oh, unless in the tunnel, I don't think I went in here.

1209
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,480
Okay.

1210
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:17,030
It's gotta be this guy.

1211
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,130
This is our man!

1212
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,070
Oh,

1213
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:29,310
finally I can retire in peace.

1214
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,890
Retiring to the chief.

1215
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:37,810
Hello.

1216
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:46,110
You're a renegade, Polyblank.

1217
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:48,050
A loose cannon.

1218
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:49,490
Uh-huh.

1219
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:50,610
I said retire.

1220
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,650
I didn't mean retirement.

1221
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:53,350
Oh.

1222
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,410
I meant dead meat.

1223
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:54,870
Oh.

1224
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:57,230
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for your badge.

1225
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:57,870
No!

1226
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:58,790
Please!

1227
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:01,890
And your gun.

1228
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,670
And your other gun.

1229
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,210
But not my third gun, right?

1230
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,610
And your other badge.

1231
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,010
Oh, my other badge!

1232
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,810
And your badge gun.

1233
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,850
And your gun badge.

1234
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,650

I'm trying to take my stuff back.

1237
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:54,650
Dang it.

1238
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,200
Automatic.

1239
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,160
Wait, autonomic teller machine.

1240
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,780
Wait, what am I doing?

1241
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,100
Huh?

1242
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,740
Oh, I'm playing another game.

1243
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,280
Another game within the game.

1244
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,780
I have my swatter.

1245
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,980
This, this feels so, uh, Blade Runner.

1246
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,940
Oh, there's something over there, though.

1247
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:38,660
The bank.

1248
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:40,920

Okay, so you got the sneeze wear.

01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,080
We're kidding.

1287
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,620
We're charging up our sneeze wear.

1288
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,640
We gotta get real sick.

1289
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,620
Can I charge it with fire?

1290
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:43,660
No.

1291
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:45,820
Okay.

1296
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,640
Okay, cool.

1297
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,760
That's healthy fire.

1298
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,980
Yeah, yeah.

1299
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,460
Now you're ready to crack vault security.

1300
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,080
Oh, yeah.

1301
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,180
Deploy the virus.

1302
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,400
Crash the system.

1303
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:12,860
Okay.

1304
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:16,860
You know, we used to use software, but the bank got onto us.

1305
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,440
Now you're ready to crack vault security.

1306
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,820
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1307
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,120
Do I just sneeze on them?

1308
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,320
Maybe they're like...

1309
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,160
Oh, what's this guy?

1310
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:29,580
Oh.

1311
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:30,520
Oh.

1312
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,480
Oh, maybe if I want to...

1313
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,480
What's over here or anything?

1314
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:37,800
Nah.

1315
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:39,860
Sniffer.

1316
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,900
I have my eye on you.

1317
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,400
I don't like you.

1318
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,560
Hachoo, hachoo!

1319
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:47,540
Hello.

1320
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,400
I don't trust you.

1321
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,580
Let me see your identification.

1322
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,040
Akshu!

1323
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,620
Akshu!

1324
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:58,620
Akshu!

1325
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,180
Akshu!

1326
01:20:59,180 --> 01:20:59,440
Akshu!

1327
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,600
I am defeated.

1328
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,480
I am defeated.

1329
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:08,860
Bless you, thank you.

1330
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,480
Welcome to Muruf's Chemical Vault Access.

1331
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:16,200
Oh!

1332
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,200
It's a... Oh, I was gonna say it's a heist.

1333
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,720
I had a crush on her.

1334
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,100
A better heist than the Lulz!

1335
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,000
Okay!

1336
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,460
What am I grabbing?

1337
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,920
Oh, nice.

1338
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,860
How much money should I be getting?

1339
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,900
It seems like a healthy amount of money.

1340
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,260
Before taxes.

1341
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,480
Is this good enough or...

1342
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,320
Look up?

1343
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,210
Is there some more here?

1344
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,670
I think I got all of it, right?

1345
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,040
Uh...

1346
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:27,820
Look down.

1347
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,100
Eh?

1348
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,860
Uh-oh.

1349
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,040
I think they're coming for me.

1350
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,040
Um...

1351
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,880
Oh,

1352
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,720
I could just suck up the people.

1353
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:52,920
Ah!

1354
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:53,480
Ah!

1355
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:56,220
This sucks.

1356
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,720
I'm just leaving!

1357
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,880
I have my eye on you.

1358
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,560
I guess that means more yen for us, huh?

1359
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,020
Yeah.

1360
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,340
Wait, I just have this guy in my...

1361
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,360
I like your attitude, Polyblank.

1362
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,160
Thanks.

1363
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,780
Hey, you seem pretty cool.

1364
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,900
How do I get in here?

1365
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:19,720
Thanks.

1366
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:20,720
Awesome.

1367
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,960
I guess that means more yen for us, huh?

1368
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:23,980
Oh, there we go.

1369
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:24,900
All right.

1370
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,360
Now just open the door.

1371
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:27,900
Polyblank?

1372
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,880
Polyblank, let me in.

1373
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,880
What the hell, Polyblank?

1374
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:32,500
Oh.

1375
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,160
No way.

1376
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,040
Oh my god, I ran off with the money!

1377
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,640
Nobody noticed the band-aid?

1378
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,700
Oh, I definitely noticed the band-aid.

1379
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,060
Wait, did I get all that money?

1380
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,640
Or...

1381
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,600
Oh, my hands.

1382
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:50,460
That's right.

1383
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,380
They're not my real hands.

1384
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,860
Closed 24-7.

1385
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,460
Dang it.

1386
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:06,430
I've been disarmed.

1387
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,010
What's happening here?

1388
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,130
Wait, what's going on over here real quick?

1389
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,170
Oh, that's his favorite restaurant!

1390
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:19,240
Okay, we found it.

1391
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:22,950

Oh, yeah.

01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,870
Oh, sorry.

1395
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:35,470
Oh, sorry.

1396
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:36,570
Do you have a reservation?

1397
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:37,290
Do you have a reservation?

1398
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:41,170
Do I need a reservation?

1399
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:47,270
Best in town, they say, huh?

1400
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:53,590
Everything sounds like that's all busty today.

1401
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:54,630
He's all ears.

1402
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,820
Oh, I can't clean his ears.

1403
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,550
That feels weird.

Oh, I'm the fly detector.

Delicious lemonade for sale.

Wow, that's pretty pricey for some lemonade, though.

Better be good.

Wait.

The insane rankings of a madman.

1456
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:00,060
Oh, oops.

1457
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:03,920
And you, Polyblank, do you have any words for Mr. Psychopath?

I'm just frothing at the mouth.

1464
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,340
Oh yeah.

We're fine.

1476
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:39,510
Everything's cool.

1477
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,390
He's almost down?

1478
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,710
Thank you on this round, Polyblank.

1479
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,870
But you'll be back.

1480
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:49,010
I'll see you at the next Psychomania Challenge.

1481
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:51,590
Total knockout.

1482
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:58,430
You are the ultimate heavyweight champion of the world.

1483
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:59,530
Of the world!

1484
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:02,270
Now that you've won, what do you intend to do?

1485
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:03,770
Fascinating.

1486
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,150
Back to you in the studio.

1487
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,350
Well, look, you's back for more punishment.

1488
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,810
Where did I come from?

1489
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,630
Oh, this is where we got our snake drink?

1490
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:26,230
This way, I think we haven't been yet.

1491
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:28,450
Steamy.

1492
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:29,150
Hello.

1493
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,410
What's this?

1494
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:35,050
A baby.

1495
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,550
Aren't you supposed to be following a cowboy?

1496
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,190
Yeah.

1497
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,430
Um.

1498
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:43,770
Yes.

1499
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:47,230
We have to go into the restaurant.

1500
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:48,990
We'll go now.

1501
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:55,250
This way.

1502
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:59,090
Please take off your shoes.

1503
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,250
Oh, okay.

1504
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:03,670
Thank you.

1505
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,250
In the whole thing?

1506
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,370
No entrance, please.

1507
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,550

01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:49,270
My grandpapa raised me to be a text instrument, ma'am.

1510
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,630
Why, yes, I do have a fancy kidney.

1511
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:53,690
Thanks, he's for noticing.

1512
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:56,430
You're going to go see John the Cash Live.

1513
01:31:57,130 --> 01:32:00,110
That's very kind of you to notice this new hat.

1514
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:06,430
My bad.

1515
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:08,010
Look at my feet.

1516
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,580
Oh, no, it's one of these toilets.

1517
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:18,820
I'll rescue you.

1518
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,090
Those are the worst.

1519
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:26,030
Oh, oh, oh.

1520
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:29,430
I don't know why I'm collecting spiders, but that's what I'm doing now.

1521
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:32,890
That's my new hobby.

1522
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:37,490
It's collecting spiders for some reason.

1523
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,250
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1524
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:40,450
Gamers don't look up.

1525
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:41,930
Okay, just two more.

1526
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:43,610
We got this.

1527
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:44,810
Underneath.

1528
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:49,390
Around the co- Hello.

1529
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:52,330
Anything back there?

1530
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:53,990
The Fogel!

1531
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,030
I don't know why I'm collecting these, but...

1532
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:08,750
Also, I am terrified of spiders.

1533
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:09,470
Oh!

1534
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:10,770
Stuff only.

1535
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:11,830
That's why.

1536
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,070
I've seen at least five spiders in here.

1537
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,430
Okay, thank you.

1538
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:18,990
Well, I've got...

1539
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:19,350
Wait.

1540
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:21,650
He's a pagan customer.

1541
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:23,130
How am I supposed to...

1542
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,950
kill him from this dinner.

1543
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:30,970
Spider attack!

1544
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:40,530
You have poor Fugu a technique.

1545
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:44,560
Oh.

1546
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:56,850
I'm not sure if this is what I'm supposed to do.

1547
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:57,430
Oh.

1548
01:33:58,510 --> 01:33:58,510
Oh!

1549
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:01,390
You have restored blindness upon me.

1550
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,730
Blinding soup!

1551
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,650
Oh, I have been defiled.

1552
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,390
We took all of his sins.

1553
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,090
Blinding stew!

1554
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,750
I was born and raised on a ranch farm.

1555
01:34:21,930 --> 01:34:22,970
There we go.

1556
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:28,230
There's a pool you can order them through the mail!

1557
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,040
Oh, I'll go by sick.

1558
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,040
Oh,

1559
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,900
oh my god.

1560
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,720
Oh, I missed this guy.

1561
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,660
You have yourself a wonderful evening.

1562
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,340
He just, he launched his whole stomach.

1563
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,640
Target acquired.

1564
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,080
Uh, I'm not sure where I go with this.

1565
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:11,580
here.

1566
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,660
Would you like me to wrap that up for you?

1567
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:14,560
No, thank you.

1568
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,900
I'd just like my shoes back.

1569
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:16,940
Enjoy your night.

1570
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:17,340
Oh.

1571
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:19,300
Okay.

1572
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,900
Uh, can I leave?

1573
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,060
Oh, there we go.

1574
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:31,640
Darlington Station.

1575
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,800
Are they coming after me?

1576
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,030
They're coming for me.

1577
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,000
That's fine.

1578
01:35:55,440 --> 01:36:33,440
We'll go this way yeah we broke the text oh uh oh bowling joke no oh my god i'm scared oh bowling bowling this is your last chance we've tried to reason with you spare me Bowling jug!

1579
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,600
She missed all the bowling jokes.

1580
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:41,400
What?

1581
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,100
He literally said bowling joke!

1582
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,720
I have a candle.

1583
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,080
It's the praying mantis.

1584
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,200
He's hitting the fly.

1585
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,020
What?

1586
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:00,820
Dang it.

1587
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,360
Sounds like an apple.

1588
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,000
What's that guy doing down there, I wonder?

1589
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,840
Oh my gosh, the apple.

1590
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:18,500
Oh,

1591
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,040
did that say light, the incense?

1592
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:26,940
Oh, and then kneel.

1593
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:29,020
Ooh, okay.

1594
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,600
Hit the gong.

1595
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,400
Fantastic work.

1596
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:39,920
Thank you.

1597
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:43,040
Now I can finally make my state and kidney pie.

1598
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:47,020
That last drop seems to have attracted us a bit more heat than usual.

1599
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:47,640
What's going on?

1600
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,720
We'll have to wait for things to cool down a bit.

1601
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,520
In the meantime, I'll set you up for a vacation.

1602
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,100
Vacation oil.

1603
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:59,500
All expenses paid trip to Kaitech Resorts.

1604
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:00,960
Go on.

1605
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:01,840
Get some warranty.

1606
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,040
Thank you.

1607
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,540
You look like you can use it.

1608
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,420
I think I'm being good.

1609
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,860
I take it with no choice.

1610
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,180
Brasilia.

1611
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,720
I'm going to Brazil.

1612
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,700
And I'm going to eat some more of my Taco Bell.

1613
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:21,740
Am I going?

1614
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:23,860
Or...

1615
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:24,060
Oh.

1616
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:40,100
Wait, am I going from Brazil?

1617
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:43,240
Oh my god.

1618
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:03,610
I was more concerned for the moai.

1619
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:08,130
I want to go to the beach.

1620
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:11,870
Is that a pig on wheels?

1621
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:13,450
Is that yours?

1622
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:17,070
My dermatologist says somebody's gotta shave me.

1623
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:21,450
Somebody shave me!

1624
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:27,610
Wait, am I going to Hey man, can you spare a minute to shave my back?

1625
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:34,870
That's not his back, but that's fine.

1626
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:37,190
Dude, that was nanosubular.

1627
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,520
Okay.

1628
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,060
And that worked, I suppose.

1629
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,440
Let's go check in at reception.

1630
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,140
My son is crawling with polygons and you terrify me.

1631
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,160
Minky, I didn't do anything.

1632
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,000

Okay.

1638
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,500
I was looking at it, actually.

1639
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,780
What we got here?

1640
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:45,300
Poly, blank.

1641
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,380
I'm so rude.

1642
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,460
A cocktail lounge.

1643
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:56,780
Okay.

1644
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:58,280
I've got crabs.

1645
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,980
I'd like to give you crabs for dinner.

1646
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:03,600
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1647
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,380
This night just keeps getting better and better and better and better.

1648
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,440
This night just keeps getting better and better and better and better.

1649
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,660
This night just keeps getting better and better and better and better.

1650
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,980
If we'll find my mouth, please let me know.

1651
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,740
Oh, he doesn't even have a mouth.

1652
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:19,100
What can I do you for?

1653
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,600
Give me one on the rocks.

1654
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:23,420
Give me the rocks.

1655
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,220
Actually, yeah.

1656
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,340
Leave out the one and just give me the rocks.

1657
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,680
Give me the...

1658
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,960
Your best soil.

1659
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,260
I'm actually from Edinburgh.

1660
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,760
This is just bronzo.

1661
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,740
I only speak sock puppet.

1662
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,000
Sock puppet.

1663
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,780
Sounds like Vicky.

1664
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,960
Marriage license!

1665
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,960
Welcome to wedding cake.

1666
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:55,720
What is a four player?

1667
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:00,300
Choose your honeymoon destination.

1668
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:02,940
That's not a honeymoon destination.

1669
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:04,760
Oh, it won't let me choose anything else, though.

1670
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:07,760
Wait, unless...

1671
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,180
Oh, it's not Wasta anymore.

1672
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,760
Suddenly it's...

1673
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:13,300
Uh...

1674
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,780
Dark Knight?

1675
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,120
Let's go to the chapel then.

1676
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:19,600
Oh.

1677
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,760
Welcome to Wedding Cake.

1678
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,380
Choose your honeymoon.

1679
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:24,880
Chapel.

1680
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,600
Choose your matrimony.

1681
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:33,340
Wait, who is it?

1682
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:54,070
I'm playing as all four characters, but also not really.

1683
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:58,070
What the hell?

1684
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,360
It's happening.

1685
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:16,400
What?

1686
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:18,660
Oh, here's a weapon.

1687
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,500
I got something.

1688
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,400
Okay, I only see myself as...

1689
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,900
Oh, I got one!

1690
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:32,520
I got one!

1691
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:35,160
I'm, like, in the top left.

1692
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,220
I should have just picked one player, maybe.

1693
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:41,720
Pre-nuptual agreement.

1694
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,300
Not the pre-nub!

1695
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,160
Don't you love me?

1696
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:48,960
You would love me!

1697
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,860
You would trust me!

1698
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,700
I won't sign the pre-in!

1699
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:57,460
It's

1700
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:12,960
the one that picked it up.

1701
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:14,780
Maybe.

1702
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,320
Oh, nice.

1703
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:17,040
I got a cake.

1704
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:17,420
What?

1705
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,560
Is this Fortnite or?

1706
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,760
Just only look at the top left, you guys.

1707
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,320
Maybe that's health.

1708
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,660
Where'd he go?

1709
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,880
Oh, there he is.

1710
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:40,660
No!

1711
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,900
I didn't even get a single-headed.

1712
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:48,770
Oh, yes.

1713
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:51,330
This is where we like to...

1714
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:52,370
This is what we like to get.

1715
01:44:53,850 --> 01:44:54,050
How...

1716
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,170
When does this end?

1717
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,150
I'm

1718
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:01,900
not sure.

1719
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,720
Civil Union.

1720
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:07,180
Ah.

1721
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,880
That's why Zeshi won their ping.

1722
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:18,800
Oh, wait, no.

1723
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,760
Their ping is crazy.

1724
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:25,390
Welcome to Wedding.

No!

1728
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,120
No!

1729
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:28,540
No!

1730
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,180

1731
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:29,800

1733
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:31,040
I want to live!

1734
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:31,640
Oh, thank you.

1735
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:31,880
Okay.

1736
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:32,600
Alright.

1737
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:33,700
We're going... Oh!

1738
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:34,220
No!

1739
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:34,500
No!

1740
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:34,760
No!

1741
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:35,160
Climb!

1742
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:35,480
Climb!

1743
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:35,880
Climb!

1744
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,180
Dang it.

1745
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:43,540
Hello!

1746
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,680
What floor was I on?

1747
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,980
Or 405, right?

1748
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:53,040
I operate this elevator with my mind.

1749
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,440
See that roof?

1750
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:57,200
Damn.

1751
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,800
A lot of birds together.

1752
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,020
Birds of a feather, I suppose.

1753
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:14,970
Who's that?

1754
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:20,170
Am I gonna see something I really don't want to see?

1755
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:25,270
Interesting.

1756
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:25,690
Oh!

1757
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,890
The fourth floor is the most luxurious.

1758
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,790
Nice!

1759
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:30,410
You can see the faces on the balcony.

1760
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:33,930
405, this is me.

1761
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:34,410
Whoa!

1762
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,090
Holy moly.

1763
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:40,810
What a room.

1764
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:42,230
Hello.

1765
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:44,210
It's a secret man on site.

1766
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:44,510
Faulty ring, opportunity is to pass out.

1767
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:45,010
Sorry, Polyglot.

1768
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:45,970
Change your plans.

1769
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,850
That word is a syndicate man on site.

1770
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:54,310
Faulty ring off its imagery to pass out.

1771
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:57,450
I provided a duplicate attaché case.

1772
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,530
until you just track them, then swap the cases.

1773
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:01,970
Check the bathroom.

1774
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:04,430
You'll have to guess the outlet to get close enough.

1775
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:07,250
Head on to the end of the bar once you're feeling a little classy.

1776
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:09,810
Look for the mouth to hone in glasses.

1777
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:11,630
Owen Polyglot.

1778
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:12,710
Watch your back.

1779
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:19,590
SpongeBob?

1780
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:35,110
Oh, massage bed.

1781
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:40,010
That's a lot of money.

1782
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:43,870
Well, this one too.

1783
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:44,970
Oh,

1784
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:58,450
I want a massage bed.

1785
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:00,830
What's this?

1786
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:03,350
Yes.

1787
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:04,950
All right, let's...

1788
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:04,970
Oh!

1789
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:08,550
No, stinking way.

1790
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:17,220
Probably fine.

1791
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:29,190
Um, I don't really wear lipstick much, so...

1792
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:33,470
Don't worry about it.

1793
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:38,190
I'm all gussied up and ready to meet a guy.

1794
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:39,510
Hello?

1795
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:44,330
Did you order room service?

1796
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:46,210
Ah, yeah.

1797
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:48,950
What about you, sir?

1798
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:50,830
Just try.

1799
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:53,470
I'm a little girl, so I'm exploring darkness.

1800
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:54,970
Just try.

1801
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:57,230
Oh, it's you again!

1802
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,570
Everybody's here, everybody's here!

1803
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:07,170
My kiss mark didn't stay on the door.

1804
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:09,270
How will they know that I'm into them?

1805
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:11,570
How will they know?

1806
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:15,670
It should have been me.

1807
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:16,490
Should it have?

1808
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:19,390
Should it have?

1809
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:27,050
What?

1810
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,350
What happened to the bird?

1811
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,190
I'm a horse.

1812
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:35,100
I'm a horse!

1813
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:41,950
I can eat.

1814
01:50:42,110 --> 01:50:43,230
Keep eating my taco.

1815
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:44,590
Oh, hello.

1816
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,260
I'm the horse.

1817
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:01,380
Not anymore, though.

1818
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:02,180
Sad.

1819
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:12,770
I love kissing wows and getting diseases.

1820
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:23,200
Nice.

1821
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:23,940
Shortcut.

1822
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,320
What are these?

1823
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:25,800
Slippers?

1824
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:27,740
Elementary physics, polyblank.

1825
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:29,560
Elementary physics.

1826
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,940
I am a physics professor.

1827
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,740
Quickly, polyblank, into the portal.

1828
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:37,160
What?

1829
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:37,940
Oh.

1830
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,080
Oh!

1831
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:41,700
Slippers.

1832
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:43,660
Slippers.

1833
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:47,120
Well, at least the atmosphere is breathable.

1834
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,800
Look over there, that newspaper box.

1835
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:51,480
What about it?

1836
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:52,860
Oh, I kissed it.

1837
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:53,680
What language is that?

1838
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:54,660
English!

1839
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:57,800
English?

1840
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,740
Another dimension of pure madness.

1841
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:03,160
Where did it take me?

1842
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,000
Alright, maggot.

1843
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:05,440
Drop in, give me 20.

1844
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:05,960
No.

1845
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:08,140
Give me five.

1846
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,460
Give me five.

1847
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,240
Come on.

1848
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:12,140
One.

1849
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:12,620
One.

1850
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:14,180
Two.

1851
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:15,720
Three.

1852
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:17,440
Four.

1853
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:19,060
Five.

1854
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:20,100
Alright, get up.

1855
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,160
Cut the hell out of my face.

1856
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,300
I saw a mermaid, you guys.

1857
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,500
Oh my gosh, there's she is.

1858
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,600
Wait, everything is underwater.

1859
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,280
What happened?

1860
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:31,800
Oops.

1861
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:32,920
I didn't mean to kiss it.

1862
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:35,160
Go home.

1863
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:40,680
I don't like it here.

1864
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:48,660
I don't want to keep kissing the walls of this unknown dimension.

1865
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,700
A different time, a different dimension comes out into the wormhole thing.

1866
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:55,120
Okay.

1867
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:57,780
Slipper.

1868
01:52:58,820 --> 01:52:59,380
Okay.

1869
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,200
Are we back home?

1870
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:01,880
Oh, no.

1871
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:03,900
I don't like the look of this dimension.

1872
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,760
Everyone's a cowboy.

1873
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,880
I can't even read this language.

1874
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,520
Society reverts to Wild West.

1875
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,680
Nixon voted local sheriff.

1876
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:15,860
Yay.

1877
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:16,780
Oh!

1878
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,980
They both died.

1879
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,720
Are you in love with me or something?

1880
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:31,600
Oh.

1881
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:39,060
What can I do with you, sir?

1882
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,920
Technically, I'm not allowed to serve as two humans.

1883
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:43,420
Oh.

1884
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,680
Give it a try.

1885
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:45,700
Okay.

1886
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:46,940
Let's go.

1887
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:50,740
Hey.

1888
01:53:57,290 --> 01:54:00,330
I like to add a dash of cyanide for flavor.

1889
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:02,730
I'm not legally palpable.

1890
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:03,910
I think we're about to die.

1891
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:04,670
If you feel blind.

1892
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:06,190
Guys?

1893
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:08,850
It was so nice knowing you all.

1894
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,890
What is this?

1895
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:20,850
Oh my god.

1896
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,750
Racing game?

1897
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:51,640
Chance!

1898
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:02,880
Hey, how am I supposed to break it anymore, though?

1899
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:03,200
Oh.

1900
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:15,220
Yeah!

1901
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:18,140
You win.

1902
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:18,840
Woo-hoo!

1903
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:27,080
I underestimated your hand punch style.

1904
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:32,480
Oh, he's fine.

1905
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,300
He's fine.

1906
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:36,860
This is a funny area.

1907
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:40,480
Everybody's cowboy.

1908
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:47,030
Someone's flying in the air.

1909
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,750
Hello.

1910
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:49,010
How are you?

1911
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:51,950
He's a bug on my shoulder.

1912
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:56,430
And that, oh, there really is a bug on her shoulder.

1913
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:58,650
Get it off, get it off, get it off.

1914
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:13,750
What doesn't, what she doesn't know won't kill her.

1915
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:16,450
Wait, so am I back home or...

1916
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:18,290
Pardon me, my good Samaritan.

1917
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:22,910
I've taken notice of your propensity for performing very often.

1918
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:30,110
Shall we say unfunded favors for the inhabitants of these most profitable predators?

1919
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:36,140
Punch!

1920
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,420
Are the maps pontificating?

1921
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,240
Whether you'd be so good.

1922
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:40,840
What is this?

1923
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,740
Rear pool is under maintenance.

1924
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,260
I think we're basically back at the normal...

1925
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:50,540
Oh!

1926
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:53,060
Besides being in the wild, what?

1927
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:54,380
Elementary physics, polyblank.

1928
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,120
Elementary physics.

1929
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:57,100
Where else can we go?

1930
01:56:57,260 --> 01:56:58,160
Quickly, polyblank.

1931
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,140
Into the portal.

1932
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:02,500
Slippers!

1933
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:03,820
Slippers!

1934
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,980
Unless it takes us...

1935
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,400
Slippers!

1936
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:10,000
Master Bollyblank, I find this jumping is becoming far too risky.

1937
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:11,880
Oh, this looks normal.

1938
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:12,860
Okay.

1939
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,980
You should totally go check out the beach.

1940
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,180
Yeah?

1941
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,580
They won't let me.

1942
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:24,680
Oh, there we go.

1943
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,580
I'm just trying to walk into oncoming traffic.

1944
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,280
So we have to go to the bar.

1945
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:34,740
That was the thing we had to do to go see the guy.

1946
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:37,280
I...

1947
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:38,580
There was somebody, remember?

1948
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,420
He was hiding behind a little thing.

1949
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,380
I'm so glad they chlorinated the ocean.

1950
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,480
All those sea creatures were gross.

1951
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,260
No, my fish!

1952
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:50,740
It was like behind here, right?

1953
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:52,000
Oh.

1954
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:54,200
Yeah, there he is.

1955
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:01,220
But this is a sea critter.

1956
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,120
No way.

1957
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,620
It's exactly what he wants.

1958
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:19,180
It's exactly what he wants.

1959
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,280
What is this guy doing?

1960
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:23,080
Uh-oh.

1961
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:26,180
Would you like to know my hotel room, don't you?

1962
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:26,880
Yes, please.

1963
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,440
You ever had a good one, baby?

1964
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:29,320
I hope you're safe.

1965
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:30,260
Oh.

1966
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,260
I thought he was going to, like, give me money or something.

1967
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:36,660
I was like, God, you found me.

1968
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:38,380
I've been standing in the stutter for months.

1969
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,560
I love that I can just be like...

1970
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,600
Perhaps you'd like to meet later.

1971
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:44,460
Yes, sir.

1972
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,860
Find me at my hotel room.

1973
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,340
Number 102.

1974
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,040
He might.

1975
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:53,760
Yeah, he might.

1976
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,580
Yo, how's it going?

1977
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:00,720
Everybody's falling head over heels in love with me.

1978
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:02,620
I can't stop kissing.

1979
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:10,940
Okay, let's go to the bar.

1980
01:59:15,950 --> 01:59:16,230
Oh.

1981
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:20,290
What a noise.

1982
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,870
Kiss the crowd.

1983
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:26,840
Oh, what's this?

1984
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:29,110
Oh, treasure hunting?

1985
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,920
You've got spam.

1986
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:42,520
Japan.

1987
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:47,460
Wow.

1988
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:49,580
Wow.

1989
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:50,860
Is there more in here?

1990
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,220
What is this?

1991
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,380
Wait, what is this?

1992
01:59:57,960 --> 01:59:58,360
Oh!

1993
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:01,380
Return the tape.

1994
02:00:06,050 --> 02:00:08,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait, there we go.

1995
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:14,030
Hold on.

1996
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:15,610
Wait, one moment.

1997
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,150
Yes, yes, yes.

1998
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:21,270
Yes!

1999
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,030
Okay, now I go.

2000
02:00:27,110 --> 02:00:28,130
Now I go back to the bar.

2001
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:31,190
I know I only have an hour until my collab, so...

2002
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,530
I know, I know.

2003
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:36,970
It's okay if I play right up to it.

2004
02:00:37,010 --> 02:00:38,170
Oh, um.

2005
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:41,190
It's all good.

2006
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:43,610
Yes?

2007
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:44,430
Can I help you?

2008
02:00:45,390 --> 02:00:46,390
There's crabs everywhere.

2009
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:52,610
This is so fun though.

2010
02:00:52,670 --> 02:00:53,910
It is pretty fun, right?

2011
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:56,610
This is like exactly...

2012
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:58,070
Oh my god.

2013
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:59,390
Oh, he's a remote pig.

2014
02:01:00,110 --> 02:01:03,370
It's exactly like the silliness kind of game that I like.

2015
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:08,550
Welcome to Kaitaka's Arts.

2016
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:10,550
Okay, it's got to be this guy over here.

2017
02:01:10,770 --> 02:01:12,970
I just got to give him a big old smooch on the cheeks.

2018
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:15,430
Or is it...

2019
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:16,110
Oh, wait, I don't reckon...

2020
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:16,650
Oh, hey!

2021
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:17,390
We're twins!

2022
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:20,650
I just love your lipstick.

2023
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:21,670
Where'd you get it?

2024
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:25,450
I have no weapon.

2025
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:26,630
Who does your hair?

2026
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:32,990
I am absolutely distracted by irradiance.

2027
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:33,430
No!

2028
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:34,510
Allow me to introduce my hair.

2029
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:36,970
I am known as the editor.

2030
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:39,910
Oh, did I do it?

2031
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:41,230
Oh, he doesn't care about me.

2032
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:42,370
I don't feel for the pity, lads.

2033
02:01:43,210 --> 02:01:44,550
Compromise of the lady in red.

2034
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:46,490
Oh, everybody's in to me.

2035
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:49,030
Um, I don't think I should drink this.

2036
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:51,330
But I will.

2037
02:01:51,490 --> 02:01:54,170
I swear, I would marry you if I weren't such a playboy.

2038
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,910
Oh, no, what?

2039
02:01:57,150 --> 02:01:57,550
Yeah?

2040
02:01:57,750 --> 02:02:00,270
I trust you know what happens to those who betray me.

2041
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,270
Oh, my God.

2042
02:02:02,310 --> 02:02:03,350
I love those shoes.

2043
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,570
Uh-oh, it was spiked.

2044
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:07,750
It was spiked!

2045
02:02:08,810 --> 02:02:12,510
You double-crossing twin bitch, you!

2046
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:14,490
I'm a professional!

2047
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:20,210
You look a little pale.

2048
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:21,690
What's the matter, polyblank?

2049
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:25,990
Polyblank, polyblank, polyblank, whole line, whole line, whole line, whole line, whole line, whole line, whole line.

2050
02:02:30,570 --> 02:02:31,330
Uh-oh.

2051
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:39,840
Accepting free drinks on the job.

2052
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:40,500
I know.

2053
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:45,740
Is this my room?

2054
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:46,000
Whoa.

2055
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:48,580
That doesn't look so good.

2056
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:55,140
Okay.

2057
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:02,440
What the heck was going on in here?

2058
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:08,520
What the heck was- wait, this is not the same- wait, this is not the same room.

2059
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,100
Readme.txt.

2060
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:16,280
Hold on, hold on.

2061
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:47,480

The rear pool, eh?

2065

Yes!

2068
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,340
Thank you for how you made it.

2069
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:17,440
I trust you weren't followed.

2070
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:20,800
I have some pretty big information for you.

2071
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:21,180

Oh sorry.

2078
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:03,690
You scared me.

2079
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:06,290
Mechanical pig!

2080
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,480
Okay, oh he's got a QR code.

2081
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:16,120
Wait, but I'm blocking it.

2082
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:16,840
Hold on.

2083
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:18,100
Let me move over.

2084
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:21,740
You guys can scan it if you want.

2085
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:25,140
Oh, I'm still blocking it.

2086
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,600
Oh, no, it was right here.

2087
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:38,040
Just kidding.

2088
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:43,680
Cook.

2089
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:53,910
It really was the way out.

2090
02:06:57,130 --> 02:06:57,650
What the?

2091
02:06:58,250 --> 02:06:58,930
Yes, reload.

2092
02:07:03,970 --> 02:07:06,450
I'm not quite sure what that is a reference to.

2093
02:07:12,610 --> 02:07:15,930
It leads to Gamersup's code name Boomer.

2094
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:17,470
No way.

2095
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,170
Whoops.

2096
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:20,310
Continue the game.

2097
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:20,950
Thank you.

2098
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:22,050
Let's go through.

2099
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:27,790
I'm curious what's going on now.

2100
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:33,230
Escape the wetworks.

2101
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:40,480
Whoa.

2102
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:01,960
I knew you had too much ice cream.

2103
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,720
your file format.

2104
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:06,200
Where are we?

2105
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:14,840
What are these?

2106
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:16,420
Oh, wait.

2107
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:17,800
Oh, I can upgrade him.

2108
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:20,280
And you!

2109
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:27,100
It's the incredible machine!

2110
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:33,240
I go to the bathroom and come back.

2111
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:36,100
We're escaping the simulation?

2112
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:37,320
Oh, what happened?

2113
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:43,300
Don't worry about it, we're just escaping the simulation.

2114
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:44,160
No big deal.

2115
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:45,080
Can I fall?

2116
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,760
Okay, it doesn't seem like a gun.

2117
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:54,320
Zip me up.

2118
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:56,140
Oh, dot zip me up.

2119
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:03,020
What's the other way, though?

2120
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:05,640
This one.

2121
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:09,620
Oh!

2122
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:11,740
I did it again.

2123
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,820
Just let me finish this game of solitaire.

2124
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:37,680
Oh

2125
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:44,780
Where did I come- I came up from- let's just go this way.

2126
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:46,580
This is freaky.

2127
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:49,340
History erase button.

2128
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:08,540
My home page is a star.

2129
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:10,440
What's that, man?

2130
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:12,320
Everything's fine, everybody.

2131
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:14,400
That's a job scare.

2132
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:16,580
Yeah, truly.

2133
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,620
There's so much I want to explore in here, you know?

2134
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:22,680
For it in favor of the Italic.

2135
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:24,000
The Italic.

2136
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:27,600
It looks like we're just trying to go up there, no?

2137
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:30,240
Well, this leads up, but this...

2138
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,540
Is there anything up here?

2139
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:33,160
Oh, oops.

2140
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:36,600
Just this area.

2141
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:41,160
That's it.

2142
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:43,340
Just E.

2143
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:45,700
Whoa!

2144
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:48,920
Whoa!

2145
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:58,370
Up there is also nothing, so we'll just go up this way.

2146
02:10:58,770 --> 02:10:58,830
E.

2147
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:00,390
E.

2148
02:11:01,170 --> 02:11:01,970
Okay.

2149
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:04,150
So we go this way now.

2150
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:10,810
Oh, what's this?

2151
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:12,210
Activate Dark Knight.

2152
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:19,530
No, I think I'm okay with how you have it.

2153
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:29,980
Just a little bit more, maybe.

2154
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:31,640
Ah.

2155
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:35,960
This looks important.

2156
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:41,640
Oh, you.

2157
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:47,680
Wow, we're so clumsy!

2158
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:56,040
Did you know that the Will-Elm scream was recorded by Shab Wooly who sang the Purple People Eater song?

2159
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:56,640
What?

2160
02:11:56,940 --> 02:11:57,200
Really?

2161
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:04,610
Speaker what?

2162
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:05,210
Oh, ew.

2163
02:12:07,110 --> 02:12:08,230
Sentient box.

2164
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:11,590

2165
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:12,770

02:12:14,490 --> 02:12:15,510

02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:16,130

2173
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:34,920
Yes, sir.

2174
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:38,900
I came in with, like, ready to kill bugs, I mean.

2175
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:40,500
Ready to kill.

2176
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:41,040
Oh.

2177
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:44,060
They sound so pathetic when they die.

2178
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:05,140
She's a gamer, Your Honor.

2179
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:11,100
Five out of five.

2180
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:16,600
I'm not, I'm not here to do the dishes.

2181
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,760
Well, I'm here to start fires though.

2182
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:31,760
Do I have any pigeons I can put in there?

2183
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:33,580
Ah, it burns.

2184
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,340
Smells like burning.

2185
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:41,340
What do you, what else do you need me to do?

2186
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:43,000
The last one you got slowly.

2187
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:43,800
Okay.

2188
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:45,860
Oh, thank you.

2189
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,720
I'm the master baster.

2190
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:58,440
We'll just leave that nice and tender, you know.

2191
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:01,960
How's my breath?

2192
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,460
It's hard being a goon.

2193
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:14,770
Master, what now?

2194
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:16,650
I mean, you know.

2195
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:18,430
Ah!

2196
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:25,850
Oh, that's why I was in black and white.

2197
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:31,190
Is this a... bidet?

2198
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:36,670
Fine and utilize a bidet.

2199
02:15:42,930 --> 02:15:43,550
Alright!

2200
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:47,710
Oh, no, let me in.

2201
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:53,240
Oh, oh!

2202
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:58,980
Excuse me, I'm here to...

No.

2205
02:16:43,310 --> 02:16:45,450
These are- that's the stuff I found earlier.

2206
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:48,510
Oh, that's a witch's brew!

2207
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:50,630

2210
02:16:54,890 --> 02:16:55,170
Okay.

2211
02:16:55,770 --> 02:16:57,230
Everything's too silly all of a sudden.

2212
02:16:58,250 --> 02:17:01,010
I mean, the game is always silly, but even more silly now.

2213
02:17:01,350 --> 02:17:01,950
Petty care!

2214
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:03,630
Okay.

2215
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:06,250
Careful!

2216
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:07,550
Ah!

2217
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:13,510
Nice.

2218
02:17:14,310 --> 02:17:15,830
Now let's paint our nails.

2219
02:17:16,290 --> 02:17:16,450
Okay.

2220
02:17:18,390 --> 02:17:20,890
Did that say snail polish?

2221
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:22,770
Ooh, that tickles.

2222
02:17:22,970 --> 02:17:25,710
Oh, we're all getting this color.

2223
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:28,570
Yeah.

2224
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:29,890
I love it.

2225
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:31,630
It's my mom's birthday today.

2226
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:33,390
That was so much fun.

2227
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:35,370
Okay, say happy birthday to Craft Mom.

2228
02:17:35,730 --> 02:17:37,750
Happy birthday, Craft Mom!

2229
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:45,470
I love this show!

2230
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:47,310
What the hell?

2231
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:52,290
Oh, I made a bit of a mess.

2232
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:53,030
I'm so sorry.

2233
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:55,030
Wanna listen to some compact records?

2234
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:55,790
No.

2235
02:17:58,130 --> 02:17:59,450
We'll keep this on.

2236
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:01,050
This is my favorite show too.

2237
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:04,170
The music is so silly.

2238
02:18:05,210 --> 02:18:07,710
For a long time after-

2239
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:20,740
Do the scientist.

2240
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:36,820
She's watching Minto on 3D.

2241
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:42,400
I mean when a cute girl asks if you want to listen to some cute records with her, she...

2242
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:43,340
Never mind.

2243
02:18:53,010 --> 02:18:53,930
What's this?

2244
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:55,310
Nothing.

2245
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:58,350
This place is a humongous...

2246
02:18:59,130 --> 02:18:59,330
Oh.

2247
02:19:01,190 --> 02:19:01,790
Twister.

2248
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:07,570
Oh.

2249
02:19:08,810 --> 02:19:09,310
What?

2250
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:12,260
Bonus stage.

2251
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:13,740
Start.

2252
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,400
Yes!

2253
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:20,100
Yes, claw everything!

2254
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:20,820
Claw everything!

2255
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:21,960
$1,200!

2256
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:27,300
Claw everything!

2257
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,000
Claw everything!

2258
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:32,860
Yes!

2259
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:35,040
Yes, yes!

2260
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:36,020
Even the carpet!

2261
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:36,660
The carpet!

2262
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:39,180
It does take a sacred!

2263
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:40,100
I'm a cat!

2264
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:41,700
I don't care about monetary value!

2265
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,140
Yes!

2266
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:44,840
Yes!

2267
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:45,400
Yes!

2268
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:48,220
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2269
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:01,200
You know, sometimes I watch that video of that avocado kid.

2270
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:02,980
Like, the avocado, thanks!

2271
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:05,580
And I feel like, really, like, you know.

2272
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:08,860
Like, you know, I get it.

2273
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:10,320
I...

2274
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:14,640
I get it.

2275
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:17,740
I kind of, you know, I would appreciate, like, a banana or something, too.

2276
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:19,060
Snuffle Munchkin!

2277
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:22,360
I missed my cat.

2278
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:23,340
Oh, I think he's back.

2279
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:32,280
Yes, I am the exterminator.

2280
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:34,680
Quick, look behind you.

2281
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:39,800
Over here, Polyblank.

2282
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:42,420
No, over here.

2283
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:42,860
No, no.

2284
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:43,940
A little more.

2285
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:45,460
A bit more.

2286
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:46,040
Okay.

2287
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:48,300
A little, a little to your left.

2288
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:50,640
No, your other left.

2289
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:53,700
Go back, go back a bit.

2290
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:55,740
Oh, there we go.

2291
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:56,600
Oh, my God, he's got a bag.

2292
02:20:56,980 --> 02:20:57,600
There we go.

2293
02:20:57,860 --> 02:20:58,140
All right.

2294
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:04,080
Ah, Polyblank, we've been expecting you.

2295
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:05,580
I'll get right to the point.

2296
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:09,100
You've taken something of mine, and so I've taken something of yours.

2297
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:09,720
Yes.

2298
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:11,420
That's the overarching principle.

2299
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:12,120
Okay.

2300
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,360
What did I take?

2301
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:15,820
They've taken some of your important directors.

2302
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:16,760
I.E.

2303
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:17,300
me.

2304
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:18,100
Me?

2305
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:20,540
And it's imperative that you get me back in the right hands.

2306
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:21,360
I.E.

2307
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:22,260
My own.

2308
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:22,880
My own.

2309
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:23,140
Improvise.

2310
02:21:23,380 --> 02:21:24,560
I know you do well by me.

2311
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:25,100
Okay.

2312
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:28,160
Polyblank, I challenge you to...

2313
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:28,460
To?

2314
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:44,320

2316
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:05,820
I think I only have one.

2317
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:08,200
I only have one option.

2318
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:12,520
Oh, my gosh.

2319
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:17,380
Oh, guys.

2320
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:19,820
We'll be fine.

2321
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:21,120
Probably.

2322
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:28,780
That didn't hit nearly as...

2323
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:35,540
Jelly.

2324
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,260
Oh my gosh, wait, he's in the jelly!

2325
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:41,680
Wait, oh no, that's the secretary in the jelly.

2326
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:44,360
Exciting.

2327
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:45,380
What's this?

2328
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:50,880
That's not gonna, like, lower when I get close, is it?

2329
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:53,540
What the?

2330
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:58,040
Oh, do I need to have this equipped?

2331
02:22:58,260 --> 02:22:58,960
Okay, here we go.

2332
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:02,600
The consequences are in your hands, Holy Rank.

2333
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:05,450
Come on, come on!

2334
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:11,240
Okay, just a little, just a little nudge.

2335
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:12,600
Like that.

2336
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:13,900
Maybe.

2337
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:16,860
Oh, too hard!

2338
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,900
Okay, less hard.

2339
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:22,840
Like that.

2340
02:23:30,580 --> 02:23:30,940
Ah!

2341
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:38,930

Maybe, like, there.

2345
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:22,380
That was a bad shot.

2346
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:23,900
Can I do over?

2347
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:28,340
Wait, let me retry a little bit.

2348
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:33,380
Oh, that one wasn't so bad.

2349
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:34,100
That one's so bad.

2350
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:37,860
And then nice and easy.

2351
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:39,580
Straight in.

2352
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:41,820
Yeah!

2353
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:45,740
I wonder what...

2354
02:24:45,740 --> 02:24:47,300
I wonder what power is.

2355
02:24:56,020 --> 02:24:57,840
Luck appears to be on my side today.

2356
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:00,860
Yes.

2357
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:01,340
Luck.

2358
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,300
Does it just stab you with this or...

2359
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:11,200
Oh!

2360
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:12,380
That was a good shot.

2361
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:13,160
That was a good shot.

2362
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:15,200
Don't let it get you down, Polyblank.

2363
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:18,880
I'm doing fairly well, I'd say.

2364
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,280
I'd say, right?

2365
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:26,770
I wonder what it's saying in Morse.

2366
02:25:27,650 --> 02:25:28,530
It's a good question.

2367
02:25:29,790 --> 02:25:29,990
Ah!

2368
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:31,790
That was in.

2369
02:25:31,890 --> 02:25:32,650
That was in.

2370
02:25:33,470 --> 02:25:34,650
Oh my gosh.

2371
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:37,870
We're just getting warmed up.

2372
02:25:38,510 --> 02:25:38,870
There's more?

2373
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:41,270
Follow me, and let us begin the gauntlet.

2374
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:42,830
The gauntlet?

2375
02:25:43,970 --> 02:25:44,350
Okay.

Okay.

2384
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,240
Oh, drift.

2385
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:20,360
Drift.

2386
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:21,360
Drift.

2387
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:23,280
Yes!

2388
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,140
Lap too, baby.

2389
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:29,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2390
02:27:44,750 --> 02:27:46,110
I'm doomed.

2391
02:27:48,810 --> 02:27:49,830
Final lap.

2392
02:27:50,850 --> 02:27:51,430
We can make this.

2393
02:27:51,770 --> 02:27:52,410
We can make this.

2394
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:02,460
No, please!

2395
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:12,540
Yippee!

2396
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:15,020
You're not supposed to be able to win this.

2397
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:15,260
Oh.

2398
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:17,980
On to the next course.

2399
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:21,520
Oh.

2400
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:22,580
Okay.

2401
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:24,440
Okay.

2402
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:34,060
Easy?

2403
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:37,900
How much more of the game is left?

2404
02:28:39,100 --> 02:28:40,260
Oh, no, it's a virtual boy.

2405
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:42,720
Oh, okay.

2406
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:43,700
Okay.

2407
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:47,260
I'm the heavyweight champion.

2408
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:48,020
I'll let you know, though.

2409
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:49,460
However, I must warn you.

2410
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:51,680
I'm quite the Matrix Maverick.

2411
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:52,340
Not much.

2412
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:53,360
I'm like to call me.

2413
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:54,280
It didn't feel like it.

2414
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:00,000
Oh, press any button.

2415
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:09,060
Oh, yeah.

2416
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:25,670
Some of these, I don't know how I'm hitting them.

2417
02:29:26,230 --> 02:29:26,530
Wait!

2418
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:41,520
Oh, shoot.

2419
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:42,580
Uh oh.

2420
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:44,160
No!

2421
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:50,860
Did he just say that he's, that I'm not superior to him?

2422
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:52,740
Really?

2423
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:53,420
Oh, shoot.

2424
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:54,020
Oh, shoot.

2425
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:54,700
Where'd it go?

2426
02:29:55,960 --> 02:29:57,400
I can't see the ball.

2427
02:30:02,950 --> 02:30:05,090
I thought we were supposed to be punching each other.

2428
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:16,700
Guys, I'm not good at this.

2429
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:18,580
Wait, how did I get two?

2430
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:20,140
When did that happen?

2431
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:22,640
I'm the king of the worm.

2432
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:23,260
How did he?

2433
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:24,540
I'm a little worm.

2434
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:25,900
I'm a worm!

2435
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:30,520
Oh, because I think his also went out of bounds at one point.

2436
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:33,640
It needs to bounce, right?

2437
02:30:43,470 --> 02:30:44,290
Oh my gosh.

2438
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:47,570
I am very frustrated in my performance.

2439
02:30:47,950 --> 02:30:49,570
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2440
02:30:59,080 --> 02:30:59,880
to get.

2441
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:03,180
Uh-oh.

2442
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:03,940
Oh, that was close.

2443
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,460
His ego meter.

2444
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:14,620
I prefer to call this reverse winning.

2445
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:16,800
You get a little tomato like there, buddy.

2446
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:18,040
I believe you need to calibrate this thing.

2447
02:31:18,480 --> 02:31:20,420
There's no way you should have been able to win that.

2448
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,340
Ow, let me go on the first.

2449
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:23,700
First place for me!

2450
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:27,000
If you would be so kind, is to hand me my trophy.

2451
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:37,340
Water, you stupid.

2452
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:39,420
Oh my gosh, it's smart water.

2453
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:41,500
No,

2454
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:46,740
no playing on the job.

2455
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,400
Oh, what's going on now?

2456
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:49,680
You should hop in.

2457
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:51,160
The water is perfect.

2458
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:53,380
Genocide!

2459
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:56,360
Whoa!

2460
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:00,980
Oh, gosh.

2461
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:02,380
I can't even get in.

2462
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:20,580
I'm so thirsty.

2463
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:24,440
Oh, um...

2464
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:25,440
Yeah, let me get you water.

2465
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,540
Let me get you water.

2466
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:30,620
Oh, here you go.

2467
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:33,740
Yes?

2468
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:34,580
You're thirsty?

2469
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:35,640
No?

2470
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:37,940
I did press the button.

2471
02:32:38,060 --> 02:32:38,480
Yeah, I did.

2472
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:41,000
Oh my gosh, we're getting so many items now all of a sudden.

2473
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:42,060
Okay.

2474
02:32:42,620 --> 02:32:43,780
We have so many things.

2475
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:49,310
Hand me my trophy.

2476
02:32:50,310 --> 02:32:52,170
Can I make him like a little...

2477
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:53,360
Oh, I'm Edward Scissorhands?

2478
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:00,880
He needs a belt!

2479
02:33:01,240 --> 02:33:03,120
His pants fall off!

2480
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:16,120
What the heck is that sound?

2481
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:22,620
If I hold the trophy, can I actually give it to him?

2482
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:26,780
No, interesting.

2483
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,840
Well, there's this... What are you doing?

2484
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:42,780
You want to give it a try?

2485
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:46,500
Get my virtue...

2486
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:49,520
I don't want to play again, though.

2487
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,910
Leave, please!

2488
02:34:00,470 --> 02:34:00,950
No!

2489
02:34:01,150 --> 02:34:01,810
Let me leave!

2490
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:02,970
No!

2491
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:04,910
There should be an exit button!

2492
02:34:05,110 --> 02:34:06,250
Please, let me leave!

2493
02:34:07,070 --> 02:34:07,710
Let me leave!

2494
02:34:09,010 --> 02:34:10,270
I already won!

2495
02:34:10,510 --> 02:34:10,990
Please!

2496
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:14,830
You will play the game and you will enjoy it!

2497
02:34:17,650 --> 02:34:19,650
How am I so good?

2498
02:34:20,370 --> 02:34:20,830
I mean, bad.

2499
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:28,620
It's okay.

2500
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:32,560
Just one more.

2501
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:36,760
Okay, good.

2502
02:34:40,490 --> 02:34:42,450
I'm super good at this.

2503
02:34:43,150 --> 02:34:44,290
I've got to kill you.

2504
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:48,230
Alright, I have all this stuff.

2505
02:34:50,550 --> 02:34:51,850
Hand me my trophy.

2506
02:34:56,390 --> 02:34:56,670
Okay.

2507
02:34:57,890 --> 02:35:01,280
Oh my gosh!

2508
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,660
Oopsie.

2509
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:07,380
You thirsty?

2510
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:11,380
Is this the trophy he wants?

2511
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:16,180
She said she was thirsty.

2512
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:21,440
But she doesn't want to drink.

2513
02:35:33,580 --> 02:35:35,680
Maybe I grabbed everything I could.

2514
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:43,180
I hear like a...

2515
02:35:43,180 --> 02:35:43,440
Whoa!

2516
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:48,270
Neat.

2517
02:35:49,830 --> 02:35:50,170
Eh?

2518
02:35:51,470 --> 02:35:53,190
Can you dunk the trophy?

2519
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:55,290
Let's try.

2520
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:57,210
Hmm.

2521
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:01,570
Oh, it literally is a blender.

2522
02:36:01,990 --> 02:36:02,750
That's crazy.

2523
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:09,390
You want this?

2524
02:36:09,570 --> 02:36:10,130
Or this?

2525
02:36:10,670 --> 02:36:11,250
Or this?

2526
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:11,410
Or this?

2527
02:36:11,990 --> 02:36:12,470
Anything?

2528
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:19,780
Oh, oh, I just realized there's this over here.

2529
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:22,160
Oh, wait, no, this is where I went to before.

2530
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:23,160
I'm silly.

2531
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:28,820
And we just drink that, so it's not like I can give it to her.

2532
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:32,980
Why suddenly am I stuck?

2533
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:35,260
Up?

2534
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:38,880
Wait, can I drive this?

2535
02:36:48,660 --> 02:36:49,980
There's a brain in the water.

2536
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:50,700
Yeah, yeah.

2537
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:53,940
Oh, can I touch the cooler itself?

2538
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:55,160
Let's try it.

2539
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:01,870
Oh, I can!

2540
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:04,710
Oh, I didn't realize I could.

2541
02:37:06,010 --> 02:37:06,050
Oh.

2542
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:10,020
Oh.

2543
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:10,700
Oh.

2544
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:12,060
Rebooting brain.

2545
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:12,740
Oh.

2546
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:14,200
Oh.

2547
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:14,360
Oh.

2548
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:15,220
Whoa.

2549
02:37:17,020 --> 02:37:17,640
We

2550
02:37:47,710 --> 02:37:49,310
got the brain power.

2551
02:37:52,170 --> 02:37:53,670
Wait, you think it bugged?

2552
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:57,950

Here we go!

2563
02:39:52,630 --> 02:39:54,550
You flatter me, Polyblank.

2564
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:55,210
Oh!

2565
02:39:57,170 --> 02:39:58,490
And you're...

2566
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:59,010
You're metal?

2567
02:39:59,110 --> 02:40:01,170
Oh, I don't deserve such an accolade.

2568
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:08,370
He doesn't want the promiscuous polynomials.

2569
02:40:11,030 --> 02:40:11,830
Uh...

2570
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:15,290
Wait, do I need one more?

2571
02:40:16,730 --> 02:40:17,590
Was there something else?

2572
02:40:17,770 --> 02:40:19,170
Or maybe I give him the trophy now.

2573
02:40:24,970 --> 02:40:26,150
There we go.

2574
02:40:27,050 --> 02:40:27,490
Ha-ya!

2575
02:40:34,330 --> 02:40:35,270
Save the director.

2576
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:36,030
Save the director.

2577
02:40:37,330 --> 02:40:38,550
You want to give it a try?

2578
02:40:40,450 --> 02:40:41,510
Where's the director at?

2579
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:42,530
How do I save him?

2580
02:40:44,210 --> 02:40:45,450
How do I get to the director?

2581
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:48,050
Uh...

2582
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:53,010
Uh...

2583
02:40:53,010 --> 02:40:53,770
Save the director.

2584
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:54,670
Okay, okay.

2585
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:56,630
Maybe this car instead.

2586
02:40:58,530 --> 02:41:00,210
Get back to the direct...

2587
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:01,230
Save the...

2588
02:41:01,930 --> 02:41:02,530
Director!

2589
02:41:03,170 --> 02:41:03,590
Director!

2590
02:41:04,170 --> 02:41:06,350
Director, I don't know how to drive a car anymore!

2591
02:41:07,750 --> 02:41:08,450
I'm blind?

2592
02:41:08,890 --> 02:41:09,390
Wait, am I?

2593
02:41:09,530 --> 02:41:10,210
Where is he?

2594
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:14,790
Do you know?

2595
02:41:15,650 --> 02:41:16,730
Follow the words?

2596
02:41:17,810 --> 02:41:18,410
Oh!

2597
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:24,870
My bad.

2598
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:26,810
Excuse me.

2599
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:28,270
Uh-oh.

2600
02:41:28,470 --> 02:41:28,990
Bird strike.

2601
02:41:30,130 --> 02:41:30,730
Bird strike.

2602
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:34,290
We're fine.

2603
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,020
Chop, chop, chop!

2604
02:41:46,690 --> 02:41:48,650
26 hours later?

2605
02:41:49,690 --> 02:41:51,210
The director is ready for you.

2606
02:41:52,190 --> 02:41:52,810
Thank you.

2607
02:41:53,910 --> 02:41:55,930
Consume vast quantities of jelly.

2608
02:41:56,770 --> 02:41:59,810
It seems they've got me suspended in some sort of a...

2609
02:42:01,630 --> 02:42:02,110
Whiskey.

2610
02:42:03,370 --> 02:42:03,850
Crockification.

2611
02:42:03,850 --> 02:42:04,950
I call a whiskey.

2612
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:06,050
Holy blank.

2613
02:42:06,410 --> 02:42:08,510
Please save me before I drink the whole thing.

2614
02:42:10,990 --> 02:42:11,370
What the...

2615
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:12,690
You could become a crocodile.

2616
02:42:25,220 --> 02:42:27,240
Any, many, many, many more.

2617
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:29,220
Pick...

2618
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:30,400
Wait, wait.

2619
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:33,520
Save and load.

2620
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:35,160
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

2621
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:36,920
Oh!

2622
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:39,080
Oh, Gatorite!

2623
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:44,700
Sorry, old Sam, but a crock's got to do what a crock's got to do.

2624
02:42:45,140 --> 02:42:49,020
I mean, you might as well crawl in my mouth now, because it's only going to end one way.

2625
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:49,780
No way.

2626
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:51,940
Ah, shucks.

2627
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:55,540
Do I have anything I can give him?

2628
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:56,340
Let's see.

2629
02:42:56,660 --> 02:42:58,780
Uh, is that butter?

2630
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:01,560
Oh.

2631
02:43:07,420 --> 02:43:09,640
Oh, I'm drinking that!

2632
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:12,080
Oh, okay.

2633
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:23,210
One final drink.

2634
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:26,750
Wow, it's bigger on the inside.

2635
02:43:27,970 --> 02:43:28,750
Can I punch that?

2636
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:30,990
Give you a little bit of heartburn.

2637
02:43:35,570 --> 02:43:36,670
This is it!

2638
02:43:38,190 --> 02:43:39,710
One but a good one.

2639
02:43:48,210 --> 02:43:50,330
We did it!

2640
02:43:50,750 --> 02:43:52,970
We did it!

2641
02:43:53,630 --> 02:43:53,890
Oh.

2642
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:02,670
Uh-oh.

2643
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:04,490
I don't like the look of that.

2644
02:44:05,790 --> 02:44:06,450
Okay, whew.

2645
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:18,540
This game was so silly.

2646
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:27,060
I wish I had a little more time to take my time with some of the parts, but I feel like I was pretty good at exploring a lot of stuff.

2647
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:27,360
All right.

2648
02:44:28,060 --> 02:44:29,100
My sincerest apologies.

2649
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:37,940
I've left this tech recording here in the event that I ever get transmogrified into a man-reptile hybrid, and you need to escape the labyrinth that is my digestive system.

2650
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:40,280
I've provided some specially encoded people.

2651
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:40,980
I got a lot of it.

2652
02:44:41,060 --> 02:44:41,460
Oh, okay.

2653
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:41,720
Awesome.

2654
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:43,620
That takes me many.

2655
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:45,280
Oh, and just a warning.

2656
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:47,920
I have a particularly violent immune system.

2657
02:44:51,220 --> 02:45:04,240
uh-oh also please say hi to my secretary if i eat her for pudding if i eat her for pudding three two one

2658
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:20,040
yay that was so goofy oh my gosh only my only real complaint is i wish that there was a way to adjust the audio but how it looks like.

2659
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:24,540
Yeah, I was so goofy.

2660
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:27,620
That was so silly.

2661
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:29,200
That was a good one.

2662
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:30,440
I had fun with that one.

2663
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:32,680
It was just the right amount of silliness.

2664
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:37,900
Right on time.

2665
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:38,560
