00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,040
Hello.

2
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,140
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

3
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,940
Hi, hi, welcome in, welcome in, welcome in.

4
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,480
Hello.

5
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,780
Early stream.

6
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,020
I don't think there's any saxophone in this.

7
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,280
This is not...

8
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,200
I guess this is a type of jazz, maybe.

9
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,380
It could use.

10
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,040
Hold on, I have it right here.

11
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,040
That's my Taco Bell.

12
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,540
Hmm...

13
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,090
Oh, wait, we're done.

14
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,230
Why did it stop?

15
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,990
Why chat freeze?

16
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,890
Hold on, let me try and fix it.

17
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,730
And... Frozen!

18
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,380
There you go.

19
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,370
So talented.

20
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,230
Thank you.

21
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,250
I love mint.

22
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,350
I love denser to duck.exe.

23
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,430
I hope you'll all cover ice cream one day together.

24
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,650
Maybe.

25
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,370
Cry on tight.

26
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,450
Sayoi Naka!

27
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,670
Happy birthday.

28
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,500
My tip for the day.

29
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,000
Each more.

30
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,480
Each.

31
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,880
Eat more.

32
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,960
Crunch wraps or preeps.

33
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,020
That's what this is.

34
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Crunch wrap supreme is my lunch.

35
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,920
It's a crunch wrap supreme and it, it has a black bean.

36
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,100
A black bean one.

37
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,440
Yeah.

38
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,780
Jasmine toe is real.

39
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
You know what else is jazz?

40
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,460
Godot's theme.

41
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,800
Let me try it.

42
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,280
Any advice for this poor unprepared wish?

43
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,000
Hope you have a good stream.

44
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,360
Yes, good luck.

45
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,780
Show this, you know.

46
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,320
What does she know?

47
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,080
I know.

48
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,210
I know.

49
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,690
I'm going to cry.

50
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,110
Got the revenue, thank you.

51
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,350
I was trying to do it to, like, the beat of this, but then I
got all messed up.

52
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:10,030

53
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:30,350

school and i knew how to get home from the 7-eleven when i

54
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,010

sun was starting to set and i was like man i really don't

56
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:48,170
And I went up to a lady who was on her front, in her yard,
like at the front door.

57
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,150
And I went to her and I said, Anno, Sumi Masen!

58
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,910
And then I was like,

59
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,210
She was so shocked!

60
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,770
She was like, and she drove me there

61
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:29,090
it was awesome no I was really lost and my mom was so
worried about me and she was like um where the hell were you

62
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:40,190
me and I said oh my god I'm my goal my goal bye-bye and

63
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,510
I told the judge I watch Mint YouTube Phantom and they let
me skip J.

64
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,410
Let's go.

65
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,810
Okay, well, I'm going to eat a little bit more.

66
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,690
I've been so...

67
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,010
You have a charmed life, Minky.

68
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,590
That's not even life.

69
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,650
I'm dead.

70
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,350
Yeah, that's a true story.

71
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,710
I have a bit of a headache.

72
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,290
And I think it's because...

73
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,230
of stress.

74
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,170
I took some medicine, but I'm also like, maybe it's because
I also didn't eat.

75
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,650
So, yesterday was my birthday!

76
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,030
Could I get possibly a happy birthday from my favorite
cosplay?

77
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,350
Oh, yeah!

78
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,410
Happy birthday!

79
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,210
Happy, happy birthday!

80
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,330
Happy birthday!

81
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,890
This game might not help with that.

82
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,950
Alright, let's go.

83
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,350
I should be good after this, but...

84
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,740
I need a napkin.

85
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,850
Let's play the game.

86
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,350
because I have, oh, sorry, I'm still on the the displays or
the options.

87
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,210
I have two streams today, so we'll be writing into my second
stream, probably maybe back to back.

88
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,210
So, cool!

89
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,590
Double Minky, Double Minky, but in the next one it'll be a
collab, so it'll be a little more difficult for me to like

90
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,330
talk to you guys, so I was like, oh, I have too much to yap!

91
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,170
So let's start this game, baby.

92
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,860
Oh,

93
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,290
Why are they speaking in English though?

94
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,550
Are we at Narita or we at Taneda?

95
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,430
Whoa!

96
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,810
Oh my gosh, it's a person!

97
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,830
Wait, this is what I've always wanted to do!

98
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,710
I've always wanted to be in a suitcase!

99
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,090
Because it's po-

100
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,440
I have to be careful about how I wiggle.

101
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,780
Whoa!

102
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,670
They wouldn't do...

103
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,560
Would they do that though?

104
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,890
Would they like notice that you're a person in there and
then...

105
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,700
steal you?

106
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,900
The intro is very stylish.

107
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,160
This is so like...

108
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,190
It reminds me of like a...

109
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,240
How do you say?

110
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,580
Like an old jazzy cartoon.

111
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Like a spy cartoon.

112
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,840
They get scanned!

113
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,640
They would know I'm in there!

114
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Oh my god, bird strike!

115
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Wait, actually!

116
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,090
They don't pressurize the cabin hold.

117
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,690
Oh, it's okay.

118
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,930
I'm already goo, so...

119
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:13,030
Oh, I don't want to

120
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,880
like close my eyes and just jam, but I want to keep watching
too.

121
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,380
Wow!

122
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,080
This is cool.

123
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,840
Whoa, my sensitivity...

124
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,020
Did they... Wait, whoa, whoa, the sensitivity is like
actually insane.

125
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,640
Hold on.

126
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,940
Controls?

127
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,120
Input?

128
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,980
Oh, here we go, here we go.

129
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,600
Now sensitivity.

130
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Like half that.

131
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,420
A little bit more.

132
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,320
A little bit more.

133
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,900
1,000 times sensitivity.

134
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,040
What if I...

135
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,840
That wasn't even full sensitivity.

136
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,650
Let's see what full is.

137
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,070
Holy cow.

138
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,170
Okay, I'm trying to look forward.

139
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,170
Only a psychopath would play like this.

140
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,110
Oh my gosh.

141
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,710
I'm even going to turn it down even more.

142
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,030
And like, turn off some of the smoothing.

143
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:23,950
Oh, whoops.

144
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,080
Ah!

145
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,320
This feels good.

146
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,100
This feels good.

147
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,640
It's never excited to watch you!

148
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,000
32 debut this friday today's also my birthday happy birthday

149
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:48,080

150
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,640
darlington who this original turning finances are

151
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,240
Just a box.

152
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,880
Just a box.

153
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,900
Import, export.

154
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,080
Can I run?

155
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh, what about you?

156
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,280
Are you just a box, too?

157
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,360
This one looks like a bomb.

158
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,700
Brooker and Brewster.

159
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,600
Velocipede.

160
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,640
What the heck is that?

161
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,660
More boxes.

162
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,020
Why is there an office in the subway?

163
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,400
Wait.

164
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,080
Down, honey.

165
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,660
The director will be right with you.

166
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,100
Oh, are there subtitles?

167
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,640
One second.

168
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,820
Sorry, I keep clicking objectives.

169
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,760
Display.

170
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,300
No.

171
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,240
Input.

172
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:53,880
Control.

173
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,740
I like how it says joystick one, button one, but I'm not
using

174
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
Sorry, but there's none, it seems.

175
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,620
They are always on.

176
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,500
Yes, but no.

177
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Okay.

178
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,420
Subtitles are part of the game.

179
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,880
Okay, well maybe she's not important enough.

180
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,740
She's Secretary the 9th.

181
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Yes?

182
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,660
So sorry.

183
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
Continue your work.

184
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,860
I'm just seeing what you've got going on.

185
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,820

God, we have Einstein over here.

188
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,640

189
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,320

Chords or style letters.

194
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,940
You choose the style you want to learn.

195
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,920
Rate is 45k yen an hour.

196
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,760
Please call Mr. Livermore.

197
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,660
Why is everything...

198
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,180
Why are we...

199
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Are we in Japan?

200
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,080
Hello to my tiny little mini and precious minto.

201
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,680
Paiso.

202
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,180
We're in jazz pan.

203
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,720
Marzipan?

204
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,420
Maybe.

205
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,260
How do you say it?

206
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,700
Paiso.

207
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,060
And then someone's selling their car.

208
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,260
This is manual.

209
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,680
You guys know how to drive manual.

210
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:39,960
Wait.

211
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,640
Yeah, you know how to drive manual?

212
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,860
It's like Piazzo.

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,160
Oh.

214
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,880
Piazzo.

215
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
Only Americans don't.

216
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,120
Why?

217
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,080
That's not true.

218
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,140
It's normal to drive manual here.

219
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,620
Really?

220
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,580
Where are you?

221
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,260
Okay.

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,230

Am I a spy?

249
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,740
Basically, we need you to infiltrate the Soviet Consulate.

250
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,260
He doesn't even say anything about it.

251
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,860
They've taken some of our important technology, and it's
imperative that we get it back on the right hand.

252
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,720

Okay.

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,620
If you need me, I'll be in the wine cellar.

257
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,980

Oh, what the hell?

262
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,800
There's no stairs.

263
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,160
Oh.

264
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,420

Hello?

270
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,760
Are you also infiltrating?

271
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,800
Believe in yourself.

272
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,820
Why are the people...

273
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,820
The cars are crazy.

274
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,040
Everything's crazy.

275
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,660
Believe in me.

276
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,520
Oh my god, I can't...

277
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,900
Sorry I haven't been around as much.

278
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,460
I'm going to congratulate you on this too.

279
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,960
Dang, it might die so fast.

280
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,850
It's all about the jazz, man.

281
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,570
Oh, he could take his money.

282
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,110
I'm not going to do that.

283
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,890
He's doing a good job.

284
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,110
What's this?

285
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,910
Jazz punk.

286
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,330
Wait, I'll take that.

287
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,810
I'll take that home with me.

288
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,370
Never mind.

289
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,910
I'll calibrate your sunset for a dollar.

290
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,070
Just a dollar?

291
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,230
Am I turning you on?

292
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,850
I reboot when I want.

293
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,330
You know, I tried online dating, but I couldn't find it in a
penis match.

294
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,430
A what?

295
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,230
There were no subs- but a what?

296
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,130
Oh, you.

297
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,450
Only if you're using crypto.

298
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:38,870
I swear my animals raised for 10,000 volts.

299
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,760
What's this guy?

300
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:44,760
Psst.

301
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,240
Take this degausser.

302
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,200
Use it to scramble three carrier frequency pigeons.

303
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Hit each pigeon three times in order to degauss it.

304
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
Three... what?

305
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,420
I'm already so...

306
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,780
Ha.

307
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,860
I'm already so ha.

308
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,020
Ha.

309
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,200
Hello?

310
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,300
I need to find a pit- You're the 1,032nd player to inspect
the garbage!

311
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,040
Okay!

312
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,960
I gotta blast some pigeons.

313
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh!

314
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,440
My fist?

315
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,620
My very hairy fist.

316
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:27,980
No one's held.

317
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,040
How's the audio, by the way?

318
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm pretty sure he stole my laptop.

319
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,160
No, I didn't.

320
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,180
I don't even know who you are.

321
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,140
Oh, I got Pax's piece of crap.

322
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,720
Why is he...

323
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,400
Bruce, sorry, sorry, sorry, I stole my laptop.

324
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,140
You gotta get your own peanut butter.

325
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,020
Okay.

326
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,260
It's a pizza code.

327
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,480
Chose, think pizza.

328
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,600
Pizza initiated.

329
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,200
Oh, oh my god.

330
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm playing another game suddenly.

331
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm playing a pizza game.

332
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
What is happening?

333
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,140
Is this pizza zombie?

334
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,800
Ah!

335
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,820
I think so.

336
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,300
Oh, how old Joe?

337
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,640
Oh my god.

338
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,380
Suddenly I'm playing another game.

339
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,820
He's...

340
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,580
He's not feeling very good, huh?

341
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,620
What's this one?

342
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,540
Dual wielding!

343
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,880
Oh, ow!

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,760
Oh.

345
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,100
Oh my god.

346
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,300
Oh my god, oh my god, it's horrible.

347
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,140
It's horrible.

348
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,860
Wait, why don't they die?

349
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,280
That guy is still rolling around.

350
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,880
There he goes.

351
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,720
Slender punk eight slices.

352
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,960
Why am I suddenly playing pizza game?

353
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,100
Oh my god, the clouds are Butchroop!

354
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,800
Why is the floor pizza?

355
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,860
Guy Savage.

356
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,360
Wish I said we're this good.

357
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,320
What are these?

358
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,680
That's not part of my pizza.

359
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,820
I'll kill you.

360
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,420
Ouch, ouch.

361
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,100
Can I die on this?

362
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,440
I wonder.

363
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,300
Oh my god.

364
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm trying to slice and dice you.

365
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,540
Okay, it's not like a...

366
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,220
What's the word?

367
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,760
It's not a, if I hold down click, it just automatically, you
know.

368
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

369
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,940
Ouch, there we go.

370
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,820
Is that kiwi?

371
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,740
I've put kiwi on pizza before.

372
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,660
Curious.

373
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,860
Not many people have done that, I think.

374
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,520
This looks like a secret.

375
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,120
Oh.

376
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,420
A fish.

377
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,820
All work and no playbook.

378
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:13,600

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:43,040

00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,070
Okay, aiming is essential.

382
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,710
Okay, I got one pigeon!

383
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:05,640
Hello.

384
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,060
Can I interest you in the stick of cotton?

385
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:07,700
Yes.

386
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,470
Did it drop something?

387
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,170
I'm not sure.

388
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:14,570
Oh.

389
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,210
My eyes.

390
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:15,970
Oh.

391
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,750
Oh my god.

392
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:18,570
No!

393
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,170
Oh my god, he's dodging him.

394
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,270
He's so talented.

395
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,710
Never punished.

396
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,170
Oh my god.

397
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,110
How is he still...

398
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,670
How is it?

399
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,450
He might be the luckiest guy ever.

400
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,870
Get up, sir!

401
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,430
Get up!

402
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,470
Oh my god, he might be the luckiest guy ever.

403
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:42,850
Oh my god!

404
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,650
He's nearly escaping death on every...

405
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:47,890
Wait,

406
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,520
don't go back the other way.

407
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,640
Oh, geez.

408
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,580
Okay, wait.

409
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,820
Hold on, I'm gonna go see if that bird dropped something.

410
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,590
I wish I could turn down them.

411
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,830
Oh, it did.

412
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:08,890
Oh!

413
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,770
Ooh, dipid pigeon.

414
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,590
How are you so loud?

415
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,250
Seriously.

416
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,850
Oh, get me out of here.

417
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,490
Get a jab.

418
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:26,810
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,270
Did I say it's 2,500 yen for a newspaper?

420
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,790
Everybody talks.

421
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,020
Okay.

422
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,740
I did notice this.

423
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,860
thought we were going to pick it up.

424
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,520
I didn't think it would be used for murder.

425
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,000
It's just in the middle of the road.

426
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,920
Maybe I'm trying to kill all my...

427
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,880
Okay.

428
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Yeah!

429
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,520
I really didn't notice that I dropped something before.

430
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,080
Thanks, guys.

431
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,340
Do I have something on my face?

432
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,520
Oh.

433
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:12,860
Yes?

434
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,360
Oh, my God.

435
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,120
Why do I feel like I'm playing like a modern version of
that...

436
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,020
possible quiz game.

437
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,440
Okay, I love you.

438
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Bye-bye.

439
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,260
Well done.

440
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,220
I can't do it anymore, you guys.

441
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,920
I can't do it.

442
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
There is no sound option.

443
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,680
That's fine.

444
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,180
We got more Ode to Pigeon.

445
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,660
What are you doing?

446
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,680
Do you have the MacGuffin?

447
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,560
A whata?

448
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,400
Come back when you've got the MacGuffin.

449
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,060
Okay.

450
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,600
Who's just playing music?

451
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,500
The president steps down onto the ground after descending
the ladder.

452
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,660
The McMuffin.

453
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,020
Oh, who are you?

454
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,620
You.

455
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,930
My aim.

456
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,870

457
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,670

460
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,290
Oh, what's this?

461
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,250
Temporal shifting decriminalized.

462
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,330
Time heads celebrate by going back in time.

463
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,670
Mega Corp CEO declares Uno.

464
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,570
Oh no, he's gonna win the game!

465
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,550
We still haven't even checked out the other side of the
street.

466
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,990
Alright, our informant was this guy over here, no?

467
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,560
Oh my god.

468
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,600
Thanks for collecting the pigeons.

469
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,260
You're welcome.

470
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,840
This is my Mima's secret pigeon pot pie recipe.

471
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,160
Oh!

472
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,800
No!

473
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,740
Don't hurt it!

474
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,000
Please wait while they bake.

475
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,240
Just like Mewa I used to make.

476
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,580
I have fourth degree burns all over my entire face.

477
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,020
Skeleton, thank you!

478
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,500
Ah, it burns.

479
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,180
Ah, I have fourth degree burns all over my entire face.

480
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,500
Aw.

481
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:17,760
Aw.

482
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,480
Wait, what if I...

483
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,660
Oh, I have no more stuff anymore.

484
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,860
You don't know me?

485
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,900
You don't know me?

486
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,840
What's my name?

487
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,720
Okay, but only if you use polarity protection.

488
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,320
Her name is...

489
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,300
My wife.

490
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,220
Condemned due to swan infestation.

491
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,920
This place is bizarre, isn't it?

492
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,040
I don't

493
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,830
know.

494
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,730
I just get ball.

495
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,150
Oh.

496
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,630
Can I do anything with it?

497
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:00,930
No?

498
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,250
Oh.

499
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:02,890
That's not.

500
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,650
Bop, bop.

501
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,570
What's going on here?

502
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,990
I'm investigating trash again.

503
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,250
Wait?

504
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,510
Extra strength plus C-backs.

505
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,610
Oh, I drank it.

506
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,210
Oh, my God.

507
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,370
Never take Plessy Bex after taking Mission Oil.

508
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,330
Uh-oh.

509
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,870
Wait, I didn't mean to!

510
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,410
I didn't mean to take it!

511
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,750
I think the game didn't like...

512
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,230
I think I messed up.

513
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,230
Let me go back there.

514
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,330
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

515
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,290
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

516
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,050
Boooo.

517
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,630
Boooo.

518
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,850
Boooo.

519
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:53,850
Ah,

520
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,490
let's talk to three inanimate cardboard boxes.

521
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,370
The Metal Gearhead and me has to.

522
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,730
The path you walk has no end.

523
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,550
Each step you take is paved with the corpses of your
enemies.

524
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,090
Their souls will haunt you forever.

525
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,590
You shall have no peace.

526
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,230
Hear me, snake.

527
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,650
My spirit will be watching you, covered in pigeons.

528
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,150
for salmon spawning season.

529
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,910
Ah!

530
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,250
Don't scare me!

531
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,890
Oh, he's yelling, he's like, aw.

532
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:40,850
Ah.

533
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,150
Ah.

534
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,250
Ah.

535
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,490
Ah.

536
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,470
Ah.

537
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,050
Into the street you go, into the street.

538
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:10,580
It's like it's like I turned into a high school bully a
sound oh I just ate this the trash sandwich It looked

539
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,600
perfectly fine though.

540
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:30,900
I think Fish and chips Hello, my name is Johnny to Johnny to
hello my mother never thought me to speak and smell She's

541
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,840
just consuming everything.

542
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,840
I can't stop!

543
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,820
I'm so hungry!

544
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,940
I got an idea.

545
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,940
What's that?

546
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,400
Push this button.

547
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,780
He said push this button but the subtitle says pull my
finger.

548
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,880
Johnny!

549
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,420
John!

550
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,660
Oh my gosh.

551
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,920
Don't scare me like that!

552
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,600
Good thing I have quicksave.

553
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,860
I'm superior to a trash can in almost every way.

554
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,800
I can modulate my voice all day long.

555
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,880
Why do you humans insist on including your epidermis?

556
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,220
Are you a person or an antelope?

557
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,440
I don't know anywhere.

558
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,360
I wish more people were like you.

559
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,740
I'm so...

560
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,440
Nice.

561
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,340
I think.

562
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,300
Creepy.

563
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Yeah, what's up?

564
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,560
Creepy.

565
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,720
Free Wi-Fi from Starbucks.

566
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,460
Creepy.

567
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,100
But I dropped my password cracker on the road.

568
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,340
I played Frogger!

569
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,800
Oh my god.

570
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,140
Oh my god.

571
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,680
Oh my god.

572
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,140
Oh!

573
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,500
It's okay.

574
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,320
We can go backwards.

575
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,300
Probably.

576
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,000
Do I have to come back?

577
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,480
Okay.

578
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,440
Oh shoot.

579
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,760
I made it.

580
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,630
How do you drop it there?

581
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,250
Probably took the shortcut, you know?

582
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,970
That was so stinking close.

583
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,070
Put it on.

584
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,370
Amphibian data visor!

585
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,690
I liked eight data packets to crack the network.

586
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,530
Oh my god.

587
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,310
I have no saliva.

588
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,150
Okay.

589
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,730
Is that a data cracker?

590
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,650
Oh, I see one.

591
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,110
Oh.

592
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,270
Then you.

593
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,320
I have four out of eight.

594
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:42,920
Oh, here's one.

595
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,320
Um...

596
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,240
Oh, here's one.

597
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,200
And one.

598
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,800
Password?

599
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,800
One more?

600
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,380
Gamers don't look up?

601
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,900
But I do.

602
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,420
Starbucks guest?

603
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,190
Alright, biggie.

604
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,200
Now a little privacy, please.

605
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,420
Oh my god.

606
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,460
What's he watching?

607
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,600
What is that?

608
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,570
What is it?

609
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,030
He's funny.

610
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,650
Privacy!

611
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,050
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

612
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,330
Oh, Titus, you came home!

613
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,890
Oh my gosh, it spooked me so loud.

614
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,710
Types that are fired!

615
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,130
And Nyak pleads insanity.

616
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,910
Can I go in here?

617
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,290
We specialize in laundering your stolen goods.

618
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,790
I think I should be able to go in there.

619
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,370
What about here?

620
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,710
I ate some.

621
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,890
Now I'm bursting with energy.

622
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,050
Oh, the fish and chips.

623
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,250
Customer reaction has been overwhelming.

624
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,890
I think Comic Sans is very...

625
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,790
Oh, this guy's stuck.

626
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:13,810
You're late.

627
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,590
Oh, I am.

628
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,450
Side quest.

629
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,130
I guess we could do a side quest, right?

630
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,450
What is this?

631
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,750
You find the mailbox marked with chalk on the side.

632
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,530
You will see further instructions from there.

633
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,330
Okay.

634
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,710
Yeah, the Geiger counter is kind of going insane.

635
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,830
Underwear and underwear.

636
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,230
No, wait.

637
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,390
We're everywhere and underwear.

638
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,730
I could tell you, but then I have to kill you.

639
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:38,950
Oh.

640
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,510
And then I have to resurrect you.

641
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,170
Locate the mailbox marked with chalk.

642
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,630
Mailbox marked with chalk.

643
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,110
Ah, ah, he goes MC Square.

644
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,350
There's a man in the park sitting on a bench.

645
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,990
Deliver this package to him.

646
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,110
Yes, sir.

647
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,570
Yes, sir.

648
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,550
Man, on the park.

649
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,030
I thought that was a person up there.

650
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,030
In the bench, on the bench.

651
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,890
Sitting on the bench.

652
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,810
Wait, which guy?

653
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,210
I think it has to be this one, right?

654
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,290
Or it's the unassuming guy.

655
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,390
Do you want this?

656
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,370
No.

657
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,850
Have a seat, but keep your eye.

658
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,010
Locate the newspaper box marked with a piece of chewing gum.

659
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,170
Newspaper box marked with chewing gum.

660
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:32,970
Yes, sir.

661
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,610
Can I just go in?

662
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,550
You know, I didn't even really think about it much.

663
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,150
I didn't try to infiltrate at all.

664
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,550
Feel lost, stuck in life?

665
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,970
Call the hint helpline.

666
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,590
We'll set you on the right path.

667
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,350
5-5-5 hint.

668
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,090
Nippon Telnet.

669
00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:05,610
5-5-5-5.

670
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,030
It's an hint.

671
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,130
Workers take their lunch break at noon.

672
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,770
Oh, oh, oh, whoops, my bad.

673
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,970
It's an actual hint.

674
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,190
Oh, oh.

675
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,850
That's not my hand.

676
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,830
What am I doing?

677
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,490
What was it?

678
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,630
Look for the chewing gum.

679
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,520
Oh, I was wondering if there was fall damage.

680
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,600
Oh, I know if it's marked in gum.

681
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,280
There's still shiny pig- No, Revenge of the Pigeon!

682
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,340
That's terrible.

683
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,340
Hello, Mint, please give me a hint.

684
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,160
Try again later.

685
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,180
Big boy.

686
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,100
Oh, here we go.

687
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,260
You're almost there, Agent.

688
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,560
Go to the Raytheon Motel.

689
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,540
Knock on the door using the secret knock.

690
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,760
Do not correctly, and you'll be led inside.

691
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,040
The what hotel?

692
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,620
The Raytheon Motel.

693
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,600
This one over here.

694
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,520
This is the one I tried knocking on before, I think.

695
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,260
Uh, here?

696
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:34,840
Yes.

697
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,120
Okay, we got this.

698
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh my gosh, peace and quiet.

699
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,480
Okay.

700
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,680
Watch this.

701
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,240
Wait, watch this.

702
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,380
Watch, watch, watch, mom.

703
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,060
Watch this.

704
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,480
It is later.

705
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,340
I'm here again.

706
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,680
Please, please, please.

707
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,040
Use this money to avoid your taxes.

708
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,680
Thanks.

709
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,040
Congratulations.

710
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:09,940
Thank you.

711
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,200

What's going on here?

Movie theater?

724
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,720
The show is starting shortly.

725
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,930
Retirement is bliss.

Oh, my God.

It's a what?

731
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,390
It's a swing wing.

732
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,170
It's a wing wing.

733
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,930
Is this a real toy for this?

734
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,610

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,170
It's a swing wing.

736
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,170
It's the swing wing.

737
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,390
It's a swing wing.

738
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,710
Oh my god.

739
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,670
Just give your own kids shaking baby syndrome.

00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,950
What is happening?

741
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,270
Oh my god.

A new thing.

743
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,320
It's the swing wing.

744
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,640
Get swing wing made by transagram where the fun comes from.

745
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,920
It's a swing wing.

746
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:52,900
It's a what?

747
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,440
I can't get...

748
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,060
Oh my god.

749
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,540
Wait, can I get out?

750
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,520
Can I leave, please?

751
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,920
Oh god.

752
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,340
Oh, what's happened?

753
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,140
Oh, I've been given...

754
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,120
They took my cigar!

755
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,580
I've been given...

756
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,200
Is this popcorn?

757
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,180
I don't really

758
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
care if you leave now.

759
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,020
You've already paid me an admission.

760
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,080
I mean, who stays for the real film anyway, right?

761
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,940
All right.

762
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,720
Well, we watched the movie.

763
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,200
Wait, can I see the movie?

764
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,580
If I go back in...

765
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,580
Oh, but no!

766
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,740
Get me out of here, please!

767
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,040
I should have known.

768
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,840
Weeks of fun, weeks of fun!

769
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,680
Lifetime of chiropractor bills.

770
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,920
It's the swing wing.

771
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,400
The girl's face kills me.

772
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,860
Get that away from that elephant!

773
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,940
I almost called him a dinosaur.

774
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,560
see his big thing and it's like dinosaur.

775
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,760
Okay, good.

776
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,700
We're back out.

777
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,800
It's the swing wing.

778
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,100
It is like a dinosaur, right?

779
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,020
Almost.

780
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,620
You're so small.

781
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,280
That was the movie.

782
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,080
Oh, gee.

783
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,800
A bootleg VHS.

784
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,940
Just for me.

785
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,380
What?

786
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,280
Pow.

787
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,860
I've been smoking since I was three.

788
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,220
Still no side effects.

789
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,180
I'm 34 years old.

790
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:50,340
Oh.

791
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,180
Pau.

792
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,140
Pau.

793
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,240
Pau.

794
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,000
I've been smoking since I was three.

795
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,140
Still no side effects.

796
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,600
Don't smoke, everybody.

797
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,500
Don't do it.

798
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,880
How many things do you call a dinosaur then?

799
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,640
Best friends forever.

800
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,610
Try to wear you sleep at night.

801
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,510
Oh, I don't like that.

802
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:28,250

consulate right now it's not noon these guys are not on

afraid you don't have appointment

805
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,500
I'm not sure what that did.

806
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,900
I'm sorry, I cannot allow you access.

807
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,660
What have we got in here?

808
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,000
Lunchtime, communist plotting, vodka and biscuits, potato
sack rice.

809
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,500
You have insufficient security clearance.

810
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,720
Let me in.

811
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,540
Let me in.

812
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,280
I'm afraid I must ask you off premises.

813
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,200
So, it's actually quite late.

814
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,340
How do I restart the day then?

815
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,360
What is this?

816
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,760
What is that, dude?

817
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,180
Can you click the clock?

818
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,100
I tried, but let me try again.

819
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,780
Maybe we can, like, set it to...

820
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,360
Oh, where's to be going now?

821
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,220
Oh, I can!

822
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:57,780
I can!

823
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,400
I'm silly.

824
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,500
Noon exact.

825
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,210
Okay, oh, hello.

826
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:18,570
That's fine.

827
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,570
Gone luncheon.

828
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,010
Back in five minutes.

829
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,530
Okay, we only have five minutes, you guys.

830
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,310
We gotta get up there.

831
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,890
We gotta get in.

832
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,380
I'm just so curious what else we could do here, you know.

833
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,740
Okay, I'm infiltrating.

834
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,400
And three, two, one.

835
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,700
Oh, sick.

836
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,520
Okay.

837
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,620
What do I do now?

838
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,580
Um...

839
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,360
Oh my god, it's so loud every time.

840
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,020
Uneventful news day seizes a nation!

841
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,820
Moon explode!

842
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,120
That's...

843
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,220
Uneventful, of course.

844
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,340
Top secret.

845
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:02,440
Oh!

846
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,020
Oh my gosh.

847
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,760
Oh, oh, oh, don't...

848
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,060
Don't, don't, don't, don't do...

849
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,700
Don't do my...

850
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:18,930
Hi!

851
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:19,970
Hi!

852
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:20,470
Hi!

853
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,690
Oh my gosh.

854
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,090
There we go.

855
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:26,610
Oh.

856
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,490
I'm destroying my own thing.

857
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,150
Unless that's not my thing.

858
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:30,950
Who knows?

859
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:31,410
Wait.

860
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,760
There we go.

861
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,460
Defeat a microscopic squadron of buck...

862
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,940
Said something for sure.

863
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,160
There was text.

864
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,720
That was spoken.

865
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,660
This one's funky.

866
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,460
Wait, are they gonna mitosis in front of us?

867
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,120
Oh, hello.

868
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,600
Even he's got a cigarette.

869
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,320
Everyone, do be smoking.

870
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,900
Mainframe of the month.

871
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,820
Is this my disguise?

872
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,940
All I need is a human heart.

873
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,040
What were we trying to get in here again?

874
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:31,920
I can't remember.

875
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,800
There's so many noises.

876
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,000
What's happening here?

877
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:41,760
Whoa.

878
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:54,130
We have comrade crunch.

879
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,330
There's a whistle inside.

880
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,590
Stay communist even in the milk of a capitalist pig.

881
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:04,870
Wait, what does this do?

882
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,320
Okay.

883
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,820
The tone of...

884
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,010
Do I have to change it?

885
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,460
There's so many signals.

886
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,080
There's so many things.

887
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,260
The toy.

888
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:43,720
Oh, here.

889
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,700
Did it say 2600?

890
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,300
Ah!

891
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,600
It even...

892
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,840
It's like, hey, stupid.

893
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,430
No!

894
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,940
A dope pay-per-view?

895
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,890
Oh, and the direct-

896
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,680
I'm not a zoomer!

897
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,520
We maxed it!

898
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,460
One.

899
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,200
I want to call Satan.

900
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,980
Two.

901
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,360
Three.

902
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,800
A pie?

903
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,920
Okay, see you later.

904
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
See you girl.

905
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,760
Cool.

906
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,640
What else we got on here?

907
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:38,600
They

908
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,640
couldn't max it out again, right?

909
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,000
What do you say?

910
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,300
Okay, I think I got all the options, so...

911
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,300
Very cool.

912
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,260
Target acquired!

913
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,180
Very good.

914
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,860
What is this for?

915
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,200
It makes them sing.

916
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,940
What is this now?

917
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,040
Oh, oh.

918
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,220
Looks a little dangerous.

919
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,480
It's a booty enhancer!

920
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,280
From the radiation!

921
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,500
Oh, there's so many!

922
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,020
Why did it make like five copies?

923
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:50,740
Look!

924
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,170
Wait, can I put the employee?

925
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,850
Oh wait, no?

926
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,630
Interesting, okay.

927
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,370
There's so many sounds.

928
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,890
Wait, do I use his eye to get in here?

929
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,790
This guy.

930
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,360
Thanks.

931
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,280
All right, let's go.

932
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,420
Ice alarm or fire alarm?

933
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,870
Floor lubricant.

934
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,250
Whoa!

935
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:47,990
Whoa, it's really slippery guys, be careful.

936
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,530
Pull the ice alarm!

937
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,270
Wait, do these work?

938
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:54,690
Oh, no.

939
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:55,990
No.

940
00:57:58,790 --> 00:57:59,010
No.

941
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:00,630
Huh.

942
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,010
I think I pull it and then maybe go down the chute.

943
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:09,750
Whoa!

944
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,070
Wait, but this caught...

945
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,610
Oh, so it caused a fire.

946
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,590
Smuggle a carrier pigeon into the next level.

947
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:23,930
Oh, I'm here.

948
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,340
Eat your bread.

949
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,140
Nobody's eating it.

950
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,940
We arrived in Japan or something.

951
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,140
Welcome back.

952
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:41,700
No!

953
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,860
Our benefactors used to extend their grata to...

954
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,600
My bread!

955
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,240
I hope you're ready for another job.

956
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,480
There's a biotech engineer working for Rayfield Corps.

957
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,520
Inside connections seem to have afforded him a particularly
valuable artificial kidney.

958
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,840
Estimated value on the red market is over 25 billion yen.

959
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,220
We need you to extract this from them at any cost.

960
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,680
Job carrying the carrier, thank you.

961
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,000
If it was, I know you'll do well by me.

962
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,380
Yep.

963
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,840
But if you don't mind, I've got a landline to install.

964
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,820
His shoes!

965
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
This is his favorite restaurant.

966
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,000
I actually... wait, this is such a cute design.

967
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,000
It's like a...

968
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,160
It's like a Manikineko, but it's also an octopus.

969
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,320
This game is...

970
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,400
Guys, I think this game might be a little goofy.

971
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,840
Let's take my meds.

972
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:46,780
Squid!

973
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:48,940
You know what I meant.

974
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,940
that's our target follow the cowboy okay

975
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:19,890
i don't like that that just happened to us i think that made
me upset

976
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,580
What do they mean they make ropes?

977
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,500
Oh, hi.

978
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,880
Uh, what is this car?

979
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,620
Uh, what is this car?

980
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,920
Uh, go ahead.

981
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,340
This car?

982
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,000
Um, what is this car?

983
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:14,040
Well, nobody can say I didn't try it.

984
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,240
You know?

985
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,900
Oh, there he is.

986
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,820
I mean, there's a cigarette.

987
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,280
That's not him.

988
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,160
Watashi, very welcome.

989
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,740
Watashi has a cash.

990
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,560
Why you click on me?

991
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:39,780
Oh.

992
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,600
Why you click on me?

993
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,440
I'm just talking to you.

994
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,660
You could get the multivibrator.

995
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,320
Oh.

996
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,460
It's impolite to ask a lady her fun way.

997
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,700
I didn't ask.

998
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,480
How big is your creation mesh?

999
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,760
No instant messaging.

1000
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,240
Kawarid.

1001
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,760
Do you like me in kimono or kisario?

1002
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,080
She sounds like me when I turn the...

1003
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,360
Oh, wrong way.

1004
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,780
The voice takes around.

1005
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,480
Do you like me in...

1006
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:28,630
Does this kimono make me look fat 32?

1007
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,270
That's it.

1008
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,370
This came a little

1009
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,380
strange!

1010
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,400
Why?

1011
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,280
Like as hard as but low.

1012
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,620
I don't get it.

1013
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,220
Anyway.

1014
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,980
Whoa, what's here?

1015
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,660
Talk to me!

1016
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,240
Talk to me!

1017
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,260
Don't ignore me!

1018
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,200
What's in here?

1019
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:06,660
Oh!

1020
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,300
Virus.

1021
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:15,560
Oh!

1022
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,880
Oh!

1023
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,360
Uh-oh.

1024
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,320
Um, guys!

1025
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,100
Uh-oh.

1026
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,160
Kimono makes her look ex-fat.

1027
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,260
Is that a good thing?

1028
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:30,840
Is that guy peeing?

1029
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes?

1030
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,360
Take my advice.

1031
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:36,760
Yep.

1032
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,240
Never overclock your underwear.

1033
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,440
Can you spare my tea?

1034
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,820
I'd like to drink motor oil.

1035
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,660
Ah, the government.

1036
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:46,700
Ah, it's the government.

1037
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,160
Ah, the government.

1038
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,040
Ah, the government.

1039
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,880
Can you give me a nibble of that cookie?

1040
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,980
Ah, the government.

1041
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,200
Ah, the government.

1042
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,620
Is that guy throwing up?

1043
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,300
No, he's...

1044
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,500
Oh, he's eating it!

1045
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,420
And then he's gonna eat me!

1046
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,440
Oh my god!

1047
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,160
Oh, I thought it was a cup of tea, but it's just the latter
floating in cyber space.

1048
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,080
race or something.

1049
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,580
Do not eat.

1050
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,180
Oh, I thought it was orange pico.

1051
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,380
It tastes like chalk.

1052
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,780
Sometimes I threw up things that I don't remember eating.

1053
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,200
So he, close enough, throwing up.

1054
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,780
Is he eating the rest of it?

1055
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,460
Oh my god.

1056
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,740
Ew, stop making noises behind me.

1057
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,400
Wait, was there anything around here?

1058
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,860
Can we go in here?

1059
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,220
No.

1060
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, Yes?

1061
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,400
She was so polite about it.

1062
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,900
My thrash shop has been infested with vases.

1063
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,240
I mean, opposite of that.

1064
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,000
Sorry.

1065
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:55,620
Sorry.

1066
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,860
My thrash shop has been infested.

1067
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,460
Here we go.

1068
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,760
Oh, oh my god.

1069
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,180
Ah!

1070
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,300
But I'm...

1071
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:01,740
Oh my god.

1072
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,240
Don't knock over the vases, though.

1073
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,520
Oh my god.

1074
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,040
Wait, I can do this.

1075
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,560
I can do this.

1076
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,460
Yes!

1077
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,080
There's only like two in here.

1078
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,560
Wait, did I get it?

1079
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,320
Oh, I did, I did, okay.

1080
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1081
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:27,480
Oops.

1082
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,280
Oh, I did it!

1083
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,340
She didn't even get mad.

1084
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,700
She didn't care at all.

1085
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,140
At least I can cook these fries for dinner.

1086
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,920
Fry soup for everyone.

1087
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,140
She says, what she says and what she thinks are totally
opposite.

1088
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,380
Did you know that?

1089
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,280
At least I can cook this rice for dinner.

1090
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,730
Is he saying rice soup for everyone?

1091
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,450
Yeah, you naughty fly.

1092
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,310
Yeah, I...

1093
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,290
Look at you.

1094
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,930
With your booty in the air.

1095
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,570
You stay down there.

1096
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,290
Oh, I have a fly's water now.

1097
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:16,730
Oh!

1098
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,030
Are they all?

1099
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,790
Okay, that guy's not a fly.

1100
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:35,870
What about you?

1101
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,070
They're all flies.

1102
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:50,170
Am I supposed to find all the fly people?

1103
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:53,630
Am I what?

1104
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,570
Am I what?

1105
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,750
Okay.

1106
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:04,330
Well, yeah, we're supposed to follow the cowboy, huh?

1107
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,050
Let's go find him.

1108
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:07,950
Soup desuio.

1109
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:12,710
Oh, oh!

1110
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,250
Excuse you.

1111
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,850
Milk.

1112
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:28,130
Oh, sorry.

1113
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:28,850
Can we talk?

1114
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,820
Really?

1115
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,180
Oh, hontoni.

1116
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,000
What's in here?

1117
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,800
Oh, this is where you call the hint, right?

1118
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,320
Okay, we don't need a hint, though.

1119
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:51,540
Not yet.

1120
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,380
I don't think I've lost.

1121
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,660
I haven't even explored it.

1122
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,280
YAMETE?

1123
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,000
What is your business here?

1124
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,320
Um...

1125
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,780
I'm being ultra-cawaii.

1126
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,700
I'm taking you in.

1127
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:03,640
Ah!

1128
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,180
Why?

1129
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,040
Stop resisting.

1130
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:08,580
Why?

1131
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,160
Let me get you with my fly's water!

1132
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,040
Why?

1133
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,020
Oh, my...

1134
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh, my God.

1135
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,900
Oh, I see.

1136
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,800
I became a wizard.

1137
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,290
How?

1138
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,650
How high can we get him?

1139
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:44,090
Yes!

1140
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:48,890
The force!

1141
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:50,770
Yes!

1142
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,430
I've had a cadaver!

1143
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,410
Did I win or...

1144
01:08:58,590 --> 01:08:59,930
Why do you take me in anyway?

1145
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,890
Wait, what am I supposed to do with these hands?

1146
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,410
What am I supposed to do with these hands?

1147
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,750
Oh.

1148
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,720
Leave them, I guess.

1149
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,400
What's here?

1150
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,340
Oh, oh, it's a sax!

1151
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,260
Oh my god, wait.

1152
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,060
There's gotta be...

1153
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,120
There's gotta be kazoo or something in here.

1154
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,940
I think we found everything, maybe.

1155
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,200
Oh, what's this?

1156
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,020
Okay, it's jazz.

1157
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,800
Jazz is not dead.

1158
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,540
What am I doing with...

1159
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,180

Oh, oh my gosh.

01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:31,230
It looks like a Metal Gear.

1176
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,050

Could be Snatcher.

1185
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,290
Yeah, exactly.

1186
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:16,690
So the replicants, I'm guessing, they look like...

1187
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:18,810
Like this!

1188
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,310

01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,930
Oh, that is a fish.

1198
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,130
Identification pilot.

1199
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,590
Wait, I do need to get closer.

1200
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:55,790

01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,080
The children laughing.

Okay.

1204
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,080
Well, we found one.

1205
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,000
Those are my hands.

1206
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,660
They're just stuck there.

1207
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:27,980
Very cool.

1208
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:33,910
This gotta be one.

1209
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,230
A gold watch?

1210
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,890
I'm headed to the pawn shop.

1211
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:43,090
I'm headed to the pawn shop.

1212
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,050
Okay, that's two?

1213
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,550
You think it's the bird?

1214
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:53,600
Nah.

1215
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,900
Just a bird.

1216
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,300
A boar.

1217
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,640
A little boar.

1218
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,680
Wait, but everybody else was...

1219
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:02,780
Hmm.

1220
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,600
Oh, unless in the tunnel, I don't think I went in here.

1221
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,480
Okay.

1222
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:17,030
It's gotta be this guy.

1223
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:19,130
This is our man!

1224
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:20,070
Oh,

1225
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:29,310
finally I can retire in peace.

1226
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,890
Retiring to the chief.

1227
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:37,810
Hello.

1228
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:46,110
You're a renegade, Polyblank.

1229
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:48,050
A loose cannon.

1230
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:49,490
Uh-huh.

1231
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:50,610
I said retire.

1232
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,650
I didn't mean retirement.

1233
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:53,350
Oh.

1234
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,410
I meant dead meat.

1235
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:54,870
Oh.

1236
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:57,230
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for your badge.

1237
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:57,870
No!

1238
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:58,790

01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:01,890

01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,670
And your other gun.

1241
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,210
But not my third gun, right?

1242
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,610
And your other badge.

1243
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,010
Oh, my other badge!

1244
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,810

01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,180
Wait, is that a nose?

1296
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,440
Yeah!

1297
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,860
Found Albert and the gang here.

1298
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,180
Yeah!

1299
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:16,540
Oh!

1300
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,520
It's cool.

1301
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,460
Okay, so you got the sneeze wear.

1302
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,800
Next up, you need to load it with a virus.

1303
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:24,320
Okay.

1304
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:26,960
Oh.

1305
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,440
Oh.

1306
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,400
Oh, we're sneezing.

1307
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,600
We're like sniffing it up.

1308
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,080
We're kidding.

1309
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,620
We're charging up our sneeze wear.

1310
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,640
We gotta get real sick.

1311
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,620
Can I charge it with fire?

1312
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:43,660
No.

1313
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:45,820
Okay.

1314
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,200
We're sniffing and snuffing.

1315
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,200
We're...

1316
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,000
We're getting real sniffly.

1317
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,140
I just need one more.

1318
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,640
Okay, cool.

1319
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,760
That's healthy fire.

1320
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,980
Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,460
Now you're ready to crack vault security.

1322
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,080
Oh, yeah.

1323
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,180
Deploy the virus.

1324
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,400
Crash the system.

1325
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:12,860
Okay.

1326
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:16,860
You know, we used to use software, but the bank got onto us.

1327
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,440
Now you're ready to crack vault security.

1328
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,820
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1329
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,120
Do I just sneeze on them?

1330
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,320
Maybe they're like...

1331
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,160
Oh, what's this guy?

1332
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:29,580
Oh.

1333
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:30,520
Oh.

1334
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,480
Oh, maybe if I want to...

1335
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,480
What's over here or anything?

1336
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:37,800
Nah.

1337
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:39,860
Sniffer.

1338
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,900
I have my eye on you.

1339
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,400
I don't like you.

1340
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,560
Hachoo, hachoo!

1341
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:47,540
Hello.

1342
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,400
I don't trust you.

1343
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,580
Let me see your identification.

1344
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,040
Akshu!

1345
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,620
Akshu!

1346
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:58,620
Akshu!

1347
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,180
Akshu!

1348
01:20:59,180 --> 01:20:59,440
Akshu!

1349
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,600
I am defeated.

1350
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,480
I am defeated.

1351
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:08,860
Bless you, thank you.

1352
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,480
Welcome to Muruf's Chemical Vault Access.

1353
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:16,200
Oh!

1354
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,200
It's a... Oh, I was gonna say it's a heist.

1355
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,720
I had a crush on her.

1356
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,100
A better heist than the Lulz!

1357
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,000
Okay!

1358
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,460
What am I grabbing?

1359
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,920
Oh, nice.

1360
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,860
How much money should I be getting?

1361
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,900
It seems like a healthy amount of money.

1362
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,260
Before taxes.

1363
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,480
Is this good enough or...

1364
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,320
Look up?

1365
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,210
Is there some more here?

1366
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,670
I think I got all of it, right?

1367
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,040
Uh...

1368
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:27,820
Look down.

1369
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,100
Eh?

1370
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,860
Uh-oh.

1371
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,040
I think they're coming for me.

1372
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,040
Um...

1373
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,880
Oh,

1374
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,720
I could just suck up the people.

1375
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:52,920
Ah!

1376
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:53,480
Ah!

1377
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:56,220
This sucks.

1378
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,720
I'm just leaving!

1379
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,880
I have my eye on you.

1380
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,560
I guess that means more yen for us, huh?

1381
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,020
Yeah.

1382
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,340
Wait, I just have this guy in my...

1383
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,360
I like your attitude, Polyblank.

1384
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,160
Thanks.

1385
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,780
Hey, you seem pretty cool.

1386
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,900
How do I get in here?

1387
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:19,720
Thanks.

1388
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:20,720
Awesome.

1389
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,960
I guess that means more yen for us, huh?

1390
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:23,980
Oh, there we go.

1391
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:24,900
All right.

1392
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,360
Now just open the door.

1393
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:27,900
Polyblank?

1394
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,880
Polyblank, let me in.

1395
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,880
What the hell, Polyblank?

1396
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:32,500
Oh.

1397
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,160
No way.

1398
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,040
Oh my god, I ran off with the money!

1399
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,640
Nobody noticed the band-aid?

1400
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,700
Oh, I definitely noticed the band-aid.

1401
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,060
Wait, did I get all that money?

1402
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:47,640
Or...

1403
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,600
Oh, my hands.

1404
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:50,460
That's right.

1405
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,380
They're not my real hands.

1406
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,860
Closed 24-7.

1407
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,460
Dang it.

1408
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:06,430
I've been disarmed.

1409
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,010
What's happening here?

1410
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,130
Wait, what's going on over here real quick?

1411
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,170
Oh, that's his favorite restaurant!

Oh, sorry.

Oh, sorry.

1419
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:37,290
Do you have a reservation?

1420
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:41,170
Do I need a reservation?

1421
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:47,270
Best in town, they say, huh?

1422
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:53,590
Everything sounds like that's all busty today.

1423
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:54,630
He's all ears.

1424
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,820
Oh, I can't clean his ears.

1425
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,550

01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:03,920
And you, Polyblank, do you have any words for Mr.
Psychopath?

1481
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,160
I'm gonna eat his guts!

1482
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,500
Oh my god.

1483
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:11,500
Where'd he go?

1484
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:11,740
Oh.

1485
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,100
I don't even know what I'm saying.

1486
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,200
I'm just frothing at the mouth.

1487
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,340
Oh yeah.

1488
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,340
My insides.

1489
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:23,380
Spectacular.

1490
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:25,280
Yeah!

1491
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,360
Just fired up.

1492
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:32,730
Wait!

1493
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:33,450
Space!

1494
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:33,950
E!

1495
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:35,330
Spam E!

1496
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:35,810
Oh okay.

1497
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,730
Okay, I'm back up.

1498
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:38,390
We're fine.

1499
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:39,510
Everything's cool.

1500
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,390
He's almost down?

1501
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,710
Thank you on this round, Polyblank.

1502
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,870
But you'll be back.

1503
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:49,010
I'll see you at the next Psychomania Challenge.

1504
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:51,590
Total knockout.

1505
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:58,430
You are the ultimate heavyweight champion of the world.

1506
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:59,530
Of the world!

1507
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:02,270
Now that you've won, what do you intend to do?

1508
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:03,770
Fascinating.

1509
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,150
Back to you in the studio.

1510
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,350
Well, look, you's back for more punishment.

1511
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,810
Where did I come from?

1512
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,630
Oh, this is where we got our snake drink?

1513
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:26,230
This way, I think we haven't been yet.

1514
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:28,450
Steamy.

1515
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:29,150
Hello.

1516
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,410
What's this?

1517
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:35,050
A baby.

1518
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,550
Aren't you supposed to be following a cowboy?

1519
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,190
Yeah.

1520
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,430
Um.

1521
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:43,770
Yes.

1522
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:47,230
We have to go into the restaurant.

1523
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:48,990
We'll go now.

1524
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:55,250
This way.

1525
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:59,090
Please take off your shoes.

1526
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,250
Oh, okay.

1527
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:03,670
Thank you.

1528
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,250
In the whole thing?

1529
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,370
No entrance, please.

1530
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,550

My grandpapa raised me to be a text instrument, ma'am.

1536
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,630
Why, yes, I do have a fancy kidney.

Thanks, he's for noticing.

1538

You're going to go see John the Cash Live.

1539
01:31:57,130 --> 01:32:00,110
That's very kind of you to notice this new hat.

1540
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:06,430
My bad.

1541
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:08,010
Look at my feet.

1542
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,580
Oh, no, it's one of these toilets.

1543
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:18,820
I'll rescue you.

1544
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,090
Those are the worst.

1545
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:26,030
Oh, oh, oh.

1546
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:29,430
I don't know why I'm collecting spiders, but that's what I'm
doing now.

1547
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:32,890
That's my new hobby.

1548
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:37,490
It's collecting spiders for some reason.

1549
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,250
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1550
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:40,450
Gamers don't look up.

1551
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:41,930
Okay, just two more.

1552
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:43,610
We got this.

1553
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:44,810
Underneath.

1554
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:49,390
Around the co- Hello.

1555
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:52,330
Anything back there?

1556
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:53,990
The Fogel!

1557
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,030
I don't know why I'm collecting these, but...

1558
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:08,750
Also, I am terrified of spiders.

1559
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:09,470
Oh!

1560
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:10,770
Stuff only.

1561
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:11,830
That's why.

1562
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,070
I've seen at least five spiders in here.

1563
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,430
Okay, thank you.

1564
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:18,990
Well, I've got...

1565
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:19,350
Wait.

1566
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:21,650
He's a pagan customer.

1567
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:23,130
How am I supposed to...

1568
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,950
kill him from this dinner.

1569
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:30,970
Spider attack!

1570
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:40,530
You have poor Fugu a technique.

1571
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:44,560
Oh.

1572
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:56,850
I'm not sure if this is what I'm supposed to do.

1573
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:57,430
Oh.

1574
01:33:58,510 --> 01:33:58,510
Oh!

1575
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:01,390
You have restored blindness upon me.

1576
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,730
Blinding soup!

1577
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,650
Oh, I have been defiled.

1578
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,390
We took all of his sins.

1579
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,090
Blinding stew!

1580
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,750
I was born and raised on a ranch farm.

1581
01:34:21,930 --> 01:34:22,970
There we go.

1582
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:28,230
There's a pool you can order them through the mail!

1583
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,040
Oh, I'll go by sick.

1584
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,040
Oh,

1585
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,900
oh my god.

1586
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,720
Oh, I missed this guy.

1587
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,660
You have yourself a wonderful evening.

1588
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,340
He just, he launched his whole stomach.

1589
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,640
Target acquired.

1590
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,080
Uh, I'm not sure where I go with this.

1591
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:11,580
here.

1592
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,660
Would you like me to wrap that up for you?

1593
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:14,560
No, thank you.

1594
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,900
I'd just like my shoes back.

1595
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:16,940
Enjoy your night.

1596
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:17,340
Oh.

1597
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:19,300
Okay.

1598
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,900
Uh, can I leave?

1599
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,060
Oh, there we go.

1600
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:31,640
Darlington Station.

1601
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,800
Are they coming after me?

1602
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,030
They're coming for me.

1603
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,000
That's fine.

1604

1606
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,600
She missed all the bowling jokes.

1607
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:41,400
What?

1608
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,100
He literally said bowling joke!

1609
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,720
I have a candle.

1610
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,080
It's the praying mantis.

1611
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,200
He's hitting the fly.

1612
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,020
What?

1613
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:00,820
Dang it.

1614
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,360
Sounds like an apple.

1615
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,000
What's that guy doing down there, I wonder?

1616
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,840
Oh my gosh, the apple.

1617
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:18,500
Oh,

1618
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,040

1619
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:26,940
Oh, and then kneel.

1620
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:29,020
Ooh, okay.

1621
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,600
Hit the gong.

1622
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,400
Fantastic work.

1623
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:39,920
Thank you.

1624
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:43,040
Now I can finally make my state and kidney pie.

1625
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:47,020
That last drop seems to have attracted us a bit more heat
than usual.

1626
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:47,640
What's going on?

1627
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,720
We'll have to wait for things to cool down a bit.

1628
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,520
In the meantime, I'll set you up for a vacation.

1629
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,100
Vacation oil.

1630
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:59,500
All expenses paid trip to Kaitech Resorts.

1631
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:00,960
Go on.

1632
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:01,840
Get some warranty.

1633
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,040
Thank you.

1634
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,540
You look like you can use it.

1635
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,420
I think I'm being good.

1636
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,860
I take it with no choice.

1637
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,180
Brasilia.

1638
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,720
I'm going to Brazil.

1639
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,700
And I'm going to eat some more of my Taco Bell.

1640
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:21,740
Am I going?

1641
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:23,860
Or...

1642
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:24,060
Oh.

1643
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:40,100
Wait, am I going from Brazil?

1644
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:43,240
Oh my god.

1645
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:03,610
I was more concerned for the moai.

1646
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:08,130
I want to go to the beach.

1647
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:11,870
Is that a pig on wheels?

1648
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:13,450
Is that yours?

1649
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:17,070
My dermatologist says somebody's gotta shave me.

1650
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:21,450
Somebody shave me!

1651
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:27,610
Wait, am I going to Hey man, can you spare a minute to shave
my back?

1652
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:34,870
That's not his back, but that's fine.

1653
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:37,190
Dude, that was nanosubular.

1654
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,520
Okay.

1655
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,060
And that worked, I suppose.

1656
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,440
Let's go check in at reception.

1657
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,140
My son is crawling with polygons and you terrify me.

1658
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,160
Minky, I didn't do anything.

1659
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,000

01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:38,540

01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:38,920
Okay.

1667
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,500
I was looking at it, actually.

1668
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,780
What we got here?

1669
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:45,300
Poly, blank.

1670
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,380
I'm so rude.

1671
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,460
A cocktail lounge.

1672
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:56,780
Okay.

1673
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:58,280
I've got crabs.

1674
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,980
I'd like to give you crabs for dinner.

1675
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:03,600
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1676
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,380
This night just keeps getting better and better and better
and better.

1677
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,440
This night just keeps getting better and better and better
and better.

1678
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,660
This night just keeps getting better and better and better
and better.

1679
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,980
If we'll find my mouth, please let me know.

1680
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,740
Oh, he doesn't even have a mouth.

1681
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:19,100
What can I do you for?

1682
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,600
Give me one on the rocks.

1683
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:23,420
Give me the rocks.

1684
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,220
Actually, yeah.

1685
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,340
Leave out the one and just give me the rocks.

1686
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,680
Give me the...

1687
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,960
Your best soil.

1688
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,260
I'm actually from Edinburgh.

1689
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,760
This is just bronzo.

1690
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,740
I only speak sock puppet.

1691
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,000
Sock puppet.

1692
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,780
Sounds like Vicky.

1693
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,960
Marriage license!

1694
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,960
Welcome to wedding cake.

1695
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:55,720
What is a four player?

1696
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:00,300
Choose your honeymoon destination.

1697
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:02,940
That's not a honeymoon destination.

1698
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:04,760
Oh, it won't let me choose anything else, though.

1699
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:07,760
Wait, unless...

1700
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,180
Oh, it's not Wasta anymore.

1701
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,760
Suddenly it's...

1702
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:13,300
Uh...

1703
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,780
Dark Knight?

1704
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,120
Let's go to the chapel then.

1705
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:19,600
Oh.

1706
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,760
Welcome to Wedding Cake.

1707
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,380
Choose your honeymoon.

1708
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:24,880
Chapel.

1709
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,600
Choose your matrimony.

1710
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:33,340
Wait, who is it?

1711
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:54,070
I'm playing as all four characters, but also not really.

1712
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:58,070
What the hell?

1713
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,360
It's happening.

1714
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:16,400
What?

1715
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:18,660
Oh, here's a weapon.

1716
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,500
I got something.

1717
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,400
Okay, I only see myself as...

1718
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,900
Oh, I got one!

1719
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:32,520
I got one!

1720
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:35,160
I'm, like, in the top left.

1721
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,220
I should have just picked one player, maybe.

1722
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:41,720
Pre-nuptual agreement.

1723
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,300
Not the pre-nub!

1724
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,160
Don't you love me?

1725
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:48,960
You would love me!

1726
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,860
You would trust me!

1727
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,700
I won't sign the pre-in!

1728
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:57,460
It's

1729
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:12,960
the one that picked it up.

1730
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:14,780
Maybe.

1731
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,320
Oh, nice.

1732
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:17,040
I got a cake.

1733
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:17,420
What?

1734
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,560
Is this Fortnite or?

1735
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,760
Just only look at the top left, you guys.

1736
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,320
Maybe that's health.

1737
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,660
Where'd he go?

1738
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,880
Oh, there he is.

1739
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:40,660
No!

1740
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,900
I didn't even get a single-headed.

1741
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:48,770
Oh, yes.

1742
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:51,330
This is where we like to...

1743
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:52,370
This is what we like to get.

1744
01:44:53,850 --> 01:44:54,050
How...

1745
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,170
When does this end?

1746
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,150
I'm

1747
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:01,900

1748
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,720
Civil Union.

1749
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:07,180
Ah.

1750
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,880
That's why Zeshi won their ping.

1751
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:18,800
Oh, wait, no.

1752
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,760
Their ping is crazy.

1753
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:25,390

1777
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,180
Dang it.

1778
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:43,540
Hello!

1779
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,680
What floor was I on?

1780
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,980
Or 405, right?

1781
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:53,040
I operate this elevator with my mind.

1782
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,440
See that roof?

1783
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:57,200
Damn.

1784
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,800
A lot of birds together.

1785
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,020
Birds of a feather, I suppose.

1786
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:14,970
Who's that?

1787
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:20,170
Am I gonna see something I really don't want to see?

1788
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:25,270
Interesting.

1789
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:25,690
Oh!

1790
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,890
The fourth floor is the most luxurious.

1791
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,790
Nice!

1792
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:30,410
You can see the faces on the balcony.

1793
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:33,930
405, this is me.

1794
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:34,410
Whoa!

1795
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,090
Holy moly.

1796
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:40,810
What a room.

1797
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:42,230
Hello.

1798
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:44,210
It's a secret man on site.

1799
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:44,510
Faulty ring, opportunity is to pass out.

1800
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:45,010
Sorry, Polyglot.

1801
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:45,970
Change your plans.

1802
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,850
That word is a syndicate man on site.

1803
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:54,310
Faulty ring off its imagery to pass out.

1804
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:57,450
I provided a duplicate attaché case.

1805
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,530
until you just track them, then swap the cases.

1806
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:01,970
Check the bathroom.

1807
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:04,430
You'll have to guess the outlet to get close enough.

1808
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:07,250
Head on to the end of the bar once you're feeling a little
classy.

1809
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:09,810
Look for the mouth to hone in glasses.

1810
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:11,630
Owen Polyglot.

1811
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:12,710
Watch your back.

1812
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:19,590
SpongeBob?

1813
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:35,110
Oh, massage bed.

1814
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:40,010
That's a lot of money.

1815
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:43,870
Well, this one too.

1816
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:44,970
Oh,

1817
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:58,450
I want a massage bed.

1818
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:00,830
What's this?

1819
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:03,350
Yes.

1820
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:04,950
All right, let's...

1821
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:04,970
Oh!

1822
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:08,550
No, stinking way.

1823
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:17,220
Probably fine.

1824
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:29,190
Um, I don't really wear lipstick much, so...

1825
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:33,470
Don't worry about it.

1826
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:38,190
I'm all gussied up and ready to meet a guy.

1827
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:39,510
Hello?

1828
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:44,330
Did you order room service?

1829
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:46,210
Ah, yeah.

1830
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:48,950
What about you, sir?

1831
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:50,830
Just try.

1832
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:53,470
I'm a little girl, so I'm exploring darkness.

1833
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:54,970
Just try.

1834
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:57,230
Oh, it's you again!

1835
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,570
Everybody's here, everybody's here!

1836
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:07,170
My kiss mark didn't stay on the door.

1837
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:09,270
How will they know that I'm into them?

1838
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:11,570
How will they know?

1839
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:15,670
It should have been me.

1840
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:16,490
Should it have?

1841
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:19,390
Should it have?

1842
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:27,050
What?

1843
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,350
What happened to the bird?

1844
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,190
I'm a horse.

1845
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:35,100
I'm a horse!

1846
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:41,950
I can eat.

1847
01:50:42,110 --> 01:50:43,230
Keep eating my taco.

1848
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:44,590
Oh, hello.

1849
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,260
I'm the horse.

1850
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:01,380
Not anymore, though.

1851
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:02,180
Sad.

1852
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:12,770
I love kissing wows and getting diseases.

1853
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:23,200
Nice.

1854
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:23,940
Shortcut.

1855
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,320
What are these?

1856
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:25,800
Slippers?

1857
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:27,740
Elementary physics, polyblank.

1858
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:29,560
Elementary physics.

1859
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,940
I am a physics professor.

1860
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,740
Quickly, polyblank, into the portal.

1861
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:37,160
What?

1862
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:37,940
Oh.

1863
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,080
Oh!

1864
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:41,700
Slippers.

1865
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:43,660
Slippers.

1866
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:47,120
Well, at least the atmosphere is breathable.

1867
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,800
Look over there, that newspaper box.

1868
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:51,480
What about it?

1869
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:52,860
Oh, I kissed it.

1870
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:53,680
What language is that?

1871
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:54,660
English!

1872
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:57,800
English?

1873
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,740
Another dimension of pure madness.

1874
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:03,160
Where did it take me?

1875
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,000
Alright, maggot.

1876
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:05,440
Drop in, give me 20.

1877
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:05,960
No.

1878
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:08,140
Give me five.

1879
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,460
Give me five.

1880
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,240
Come on.

1881
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:12,140
One.

1882
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:12,620
One.

1883
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:14,180
Two.

1884
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:15,720
Three.

1885
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:17,440
Four.

1886
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:19,060
Five.

1887
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:20,100
Alright, get up.

1888
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,160
Cut the hell out of my face.

1889
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,300
I saw a mermaid, you guys.

1890
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,500
Oh my gosh, there's she is.

1891
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,600
Wait, everything is underwater.

1892
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,280
What happened?

1893
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:31,800
Oops.

1894
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:32,920
I didn't mean to kiss it.

1895
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:35,160
Go home.

1896
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:40,680
I don't like it here.

1897
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:48,660
I don't want to keep kissing the walls of this unknown
dimension.

1898
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,700
A different time, a different dimension comes out into the
wormhole thing.

1899
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:55,120
Okay.

1900
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:57,780
Slipper.

1901
01:52:58,820 --> 01:52:59,380
Okay.

1902
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,200
Are we back home?

1903
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:01,880
Oh, no.

1904
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:03,900
I don't like the look of this dimension.

1905
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,760
Everyone's a cowboy.

1906
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,880
I can't even read this language.

1907
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,520
Society reverts to Wild West.

1908
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,680
Nixon voted local sheriff.

1909
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:15,860
Yay.

1910
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:16,780
Oh!

1911
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,980
They both died.

1912
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,720
Are you in love with me or something?

1913
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:31,600
Oh.

1914
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:39,060
What can I do with you, sir?

1915
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,920
Technically, I'm not allowed to serve as two humans.

1916
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:43,420
Oh.

1917
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,680
Give it a try.

1918
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:45,700
Okay.

1919
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:46,940
Let's go.

1920
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:50,740
Hey.

1921
01:53:57,290 --> 01:54:00,330
I like to add a dash of cyanide for flavor.

1922
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:02,730
I'm not legally palpable.

1923
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:03,910
I think we're about to die.

1924
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:04,670
If you feel blind.

1925
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:06,190
Guys?

1926
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:08,850
It was so nice knowing you all.

1927
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,890
What is this?

1928
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:20,850
Oh my god.

1929
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,750
Racing game?

1930
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:51,640
Chance!

1931
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:02,880
Hey, how am I supposed to break it anymore, though?

1932
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:03,200
Oh.

1933
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:15,220
Yeah!

1934
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:18,140
You win.

1935
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:18,840
Woo-hoo!

1936
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:27,080
I underestimated your hand punch style.

1937
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:32,480
Oh, he's fine.

1938
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,300
He's fine.

1939
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:36,860
This is a funny area.

1940
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:40,480
Everybody's cowboy.

1941
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:47,030
Someone's flying in the air.

1942
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,750
Hello.

1943
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:49,010
How are you?

1944
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:51,950
He's a bug on my shoulder.

1945
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:56,430
And that, oh, there really is a bug on her shoulder.

1946
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:58,650
Get it off, get it off, get it off.

1947
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:13,750
What doesn't, what she doesn't know won't kill her.

1948
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:16,450
Wait, so am I back home or...

1949
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:18,290
Pardon me, my good Samaritan.

1950
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:22,910
I've taken notice of your propensity for performing very
often.

1951
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:30,110
Shall we say unfunded favors for the inhabitants of these
most profitable predators?

1952
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:36,140
Punch!

1953
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,420
Are the maps pontificating?

1954
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,240
Whether you'd be so good.

1955
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:40,840
What is this?

1956
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,740
Rear pool is under maintenance.

1957
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,260
I think we're basically back at the normal...

1958
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:50,540
Oh!

1959
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:53,060
Besides being in the wild, what?

1960
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:54,380
Elementary physics, polyblank.

1961
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,120
Elementary physics.

1962
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:57,100
Where else can we go?

1963
01:56:57,260 --> 01:56:58,160
Quickly, polyblank.

1964
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,140
Into the portal.

1965
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:02,500
Slippers!

1966
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:03,820
Slippers!

1967
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,980
Unless it takes us...

1968
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,400
Slippers!

1969
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:10,000
Master Bollyblank, I find this jumping is becoming far too
risky.

1970
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:11,880
Oh, this looks normal.

1971
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:12,860
Okay.

1972
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,980
You should totally go check out the beach.

1973
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,180
Yeah?

1974
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,580
They won't let me.

1975
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:24,680
Oh, there we go.

1976
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,580
I'm just trying to walk into oncoming traffic.

1977
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,280
So we have to go to the bar.

1978
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:34,740
That was the thing we had to do to go see the guy.

1979
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:37,280
I...

1980
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:38,580
There was somebody, remember?

1981
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,420
He was hiding behind a little thing.

1982
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,380
I'm so glad they chlorinated the ocean.

1983
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,480
All those sea creatures were gross.

1984
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,260
No, my fish!

1985
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:50,740
It was like behind here, right?

1986
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:52,000
Oh.

1987
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:54,200
Yeah, there he is.

1988
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:01,220
But this is a sea critter.

1989
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,120
No way.

1990
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,620
It's exactly what he wants.

1991
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:19,180
It's exactly what he wants.

1992
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:20,280
What is this guy doing?

1993
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:23,080
Uh-oh.

1994
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:26,180
Would you like to know my hotel room, don't you?

1995
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:26,880
Yes, please.

1996
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,440
You ever had a good one, baby?

1997
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:29,320
I hope you're safe.

1998
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:30,260
Oh.

1999
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,260
I thought he was going to, like, give me money or something.

2000
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:36,660
I was like, God, you found me.

2001
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:38,380
I've been standing in the stutter for months.

2002
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,560
I love that I can just be like...

2003
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,600
Perhaps you'd like to meet later.

2004
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:44,460
Yes, sir.

2005
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,860
Find me at my hotel room.

2006
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,340
Number 102.

2007
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,040
He might.

2008
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:53,760
Yeah, he might.

2009
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,580
Yo, how's it going?

2010
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:00,720
Everybody's falling head over heels in love with me.

2011
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:02,620
I can't stop kissing.

2012
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:10,940
Okay, let's go to the bar.

2013
01:59:15,950 --> 01:59:16,230
Oh.

2014
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:20,290
What a noise.

2015
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,870
Kiss the crowd.

2016
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:26,840
Oh, what's this?

2017
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:29,110
Oh, treasure hunting?

2018
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,920
You've got spam.

2019
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:42,520
Japan.

2020
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:47,460
Wow.

2021
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:49,580
Wow.

2022
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:50,860
Is there more in here?

2023
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,220
What is this?

2024
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,380
Wait, what is this?

2025
01:59:57,960 --> 01:59:58,360
Oh!

2026
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:01,380
Return the tape.

2027
02:00:06,050 --> 02:00:08,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait, there we go.

2028
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:14,030
Hold on.

2029
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:15,610
Wait, one moment.

2030
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,150
Yes, yes, yes.

2031
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:21,270
Yes!

2032
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,030
Okay, now I go.

2033
02:00:27,110 --> 02:00:28,130
Now I go back to the bar.

2034
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:31,190
I know I only have an hour until my collab, so...

2035
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,530
I know, I know.

2036
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:36,970
It's okay if I play right up to it.

2037
02:00:37,010 --> 02:00:38,170
Oh, um.

2038
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:41,190
It's all good.

2039
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:43,610
Yes?

2040
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:44,430
Can I help you?

2041
02:00:45,390 --> 02:00:46,390
There's crabs everywhere.

2042
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:52,610
This is so fun though.

2043
02:00:52,670 --> 02:00:53,910
It is pretty fun, right?

2044
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:56,610
This is like exactly...

2045
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:58,070
Oh my god.

2046
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:59,390
Oh, he's a remote pig.

2047
02:01:00,110 --> 02:01:03,370
It's exactly like the silliness kind of game that I like.

2048
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:08,550
Welcome to Kaitaka's Arts.

2049
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:10,550
Okay, it's got to be this guy over here.

2050
02:01:10,770 --> 02:01:12,970
I just got to give him a big old smooch on the cheeks.

2051
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:15,430
Or is it...

2052
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:16,110
Oh, wait, I don't reckon...

2053
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:16,650
Oh, hey!

2054
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:17,390
We're twins!

2055
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:20,650
I just love your lipstick.

2056
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:21,670
Where'd you get it?

2057
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:25,450
I have no weapon.

2058
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:26,630
Who does your hair?

2059
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:32,990
I am absolutely distracted by irradiance.

2060
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:33,430
No!

2061
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:34,510
Allow me to introduce my hair.

2062
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:36,970
I am known as the editor.

2063
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:39,910
Oh, did I do it?

2064
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:41,230
Oh, he doesn't care about me.

2065
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:42,370
I don't feel for the pity, lads.

2066
02:01:43,210 --> 02:01:44,550
Compromise of the lady in red.

2067
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:46,490
Oh, everybody's in to me.

2068
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:49,030
Um, I don't think I should drink this.

2069
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:51,330
But I will.

2070
02:01:51,490 --> 02:01:54,170
I swear, I would marry you if I weren't such a playboy.

2071
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,910
Oh, no, what?

2072
02:01:57,150 --> 02:01:57,550
Yeah?

2073
02:01:57,750 --> 02:02:00,270
I trust you know what happens to those who betray me.

2074
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,270
Oh, my God.

2075
02:02:02,310 --> 02:02:03,350
I love those shoes.

2076
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:06,570
Uh-oh, it was spiked.

2077
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:07,750
It was spiked!

2078
02:02:08,790 --> 02:02:11,870
You double-crossing twin, bitch!

2079
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:12,510
You!

2080
02:02:13,110 --> 02:02:14,490
I'm a professional!

2081
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:20,190
You look a little pale.

2082
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:21,690
What's the matter, polyblank?

2083
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:24,970
Polyblank, polyblank, wholeblank, wholeblank, wholeblank,
wholeblank, wholeblank.

2084
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:31,350
Uh-oh.

2085
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:39,840
Accepting free drinks on the job.

2086
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:40,500
I know.

2087
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:45,740
Is this my room?

2088
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:46,000
Whoa.

2089
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:48,580
That doesn't look so good.

2090
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:55,140
Okay.

2091
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:02,440
What the heck was going on in here?

2092
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:08,520
What the heck was- wait, this is not the same- wait, this is
not the same room.

2093
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,100
Readme.txt.

2094
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:16,280
Hold on, hold on.

You scared me.

2119
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:06,290
Mechanical pig!

2120
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,480
Okay, oh he's got a QR code.

2121
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:16,120
Wait, but I'm blocking it.

2122
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:16,840
Hold on.

2123
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:18,100
Let me move over.

2124
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:21,740
You guys can scan it if you want.

2125
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:25,140
Oh, I'm still blocking it.

2126
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,600
Oh, no, it was right here.

2127
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:38,040
Just kidding.

2128
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:43,680
Cook.

2129
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:53,910
It really was the way out.

2130
02:06:57,130 --> 02:06:57,650
What the?

2131
02:06:58,250 --> 02:06:58,930
Yes, reload.

2132
02:07:03,970 --> 02:07:06,450
I'm not quite sure what that is a reference to.

2133
02:07:12,610 --> 02:07:15,930
It leads to Gamersup's code name Boomer.

2134
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:17,470
No way.

2135
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,170
Whoops.

2136
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:20,310
Continue the game.

2137
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:20,950
Thank you.

2138
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:22,050
Let's go through.

2139
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:27,790
I'm curious what's going on now.

2140
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:33,230
Escape the wetworks.

2141
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:40,480
Whoa.

2142
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:01,960
I knew you had too much ice cream.

2143
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,720
your file format.

2144
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:06,200
Where are we?

2145
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:14,840
What are these?

2146
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:16,420
Oh, wait.

2147
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:17,800
Oh, I can upgrade him.

2148
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:20,280
And you!

2149
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:27,100
It's the incredible machine!

2150
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:33,240
I go to the bathroom and come back.

2151
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:36,100
We're escaping the simulation?

2152
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:37,320
Oh, what happened?

2153
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:43,300
Don't worry about it, we're just escaping the simulation.

2154
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:44,160
No big deal.

2155
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:45,080
Can I fall?

2156
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,760
Okay, it doesn't seem like a gun.

2157
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:54,320
Zip me up.

2158
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:56,140
Oh, dot zip me up.

2159
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:03,020
What's the other way, though?

2160
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:05,640
This one.

2161
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:09,620
Oh!

2162
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:11,740
I did it again.

2163
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,820
Just let me finish this game of solitaire.

2164
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:37,680
Oh

2165
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:44,780
Where did I come- I came up from- let's just go this way.

2166
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:46,580
This is freaky.

2167
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:49,340
History erase button.

2168
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:08,540
My home page is a star.

2169
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:10,440
What's that, man?

2170
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:12,320
Everything's fine, everybody.

2171
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:14,400
That's a job scare.

2172
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:16,580
Yeah, truly.

2173
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,620
There's so much I want to explore in here, you know?

2174
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:22,680
For it in favor of the Italic.

2175
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:24,000
The Italic.

2176
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:27,600
It looks like we're just trying to go up there, no?

2177
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:30,240
Well, this leads up, but this...

2178
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,540
Is there anything up here?

2179
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:33,160
Oh, oops.

2180
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:36,600
Just this area.

2181
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:41,160
That's it.

2182
02:10:42,780 --> 02:10:43,340
Just E.

2183
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:45,700
Whoa!

2184
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:48,920
Whoa!

2185
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:58,370
Up there is also nothing, so we'll just go up this way.

2186
02:10:58,770 --> 02:10:58,830
E.

2187
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:00,390
E.

2188
02:11:01,170 --> 02:11:01,970
Okay.

2189
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:04,150
So we go this way now.

2190
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:10,810
Oh, what's this?

2191
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:12,210
Activate Dark Knight.

2192
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:19,530
No, I think I'm okay with how you have it.

2193
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:29,980
Just a little bit more, maybe.

2194
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:31,640
Ah.

2195
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:35,960
This looks important.

2196
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:41,640
Oh, you.

2197
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:47,680
Wow, we're so clumsy!

2198
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:56,040
Did you know that the Will-Elm scream was recorded by Shab
Wooly who sang the Purple People Eater song?

2199
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:56,640
What?

2200
02:11:56,940 --> 02:11:57,200
Really?

2201
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:04,610
Speaker what?

2202
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:05,210
Oh, ew.

2203
02:12:07,110 --> 02:12:08,230
Sentient box.

2204
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:11,590
Speaker what?

2205
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:12,770
Hello?

2206
02:12:14,490 --> 02:12:15,510
She's cardboard.

2207

She's a gamer, Your Honor.

2222
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:11,100
Five out of five.

2223
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:16,600

2224
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,760
Well, I'm here to start fires though.

02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:31,760

2226
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:33,580
Ah, it burns.

2227
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,340
Smells like burning.

2228
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:41,340
What do you, what else do you need me to do?

2229
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:43,000

2234
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:01,960
How's my breath?

2235
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,460
It's hard being a goon.

2236
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:14,770
Master, what now?

2237
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:16,650

Ah!

2239
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:25,850
Oh, that's why I was in black and white.

2240
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:31,190
Is this a... bidet?

2241
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:36,670
Fine and utilize a bidet.

2242
02:15:42,930 --> 02:15:43,550
Alright!

2243
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:47,710

2249
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:41,550
No.

2250
02:16:43,310 --> 02:16:45,450
These are- that's the stuff I found earlier.

2251
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:48,510
Oh, that's a witch's brew!

2252
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:50,630

2254
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:54,710
No?

2255
02:16:54,890 --> 02:16:55,170
Okay.

2256
02:16:55,770 --> 02:16:57,230
Everything's too silly all of a sudden.

2257
02:16:58,250 --> 02:17:01,010
I mean, the game is always silly, but even more silly now.

2258
02:17:01,350 --> 02:17:01,950
Petty care!

2259
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:03,630
Okay.

2260
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:06,250
Careful!

2261
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:07,550
Ah!

2262
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:13,510
Nice.

2263
02:17:14,310 --> 02:17:15,830
Now let's paint our nails.

2264
02:17:16,290 --> 02:17:16,450
Okay.

2265
02:17:18,390 --> 02:17:20,890
Did that say snail polish?

2266
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:22,770
Ooh, that tickles.

2267
02:17:22,970 --> 02:17:25,710
Oh, we're all getting this color.

2268
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:28,570
Yeah.

2269
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:29,890
I love it.

2270
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:31,630
It's my mom's birthday today.

2271
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:33,390
That was so much fun.

2272
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:35,370
Okay, say happy birthday to Craft Mom.

2273
02:17:35,730 --> 02:17:37,750
Happy birthday, Craft Mom!

2274
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:45,470
I love this show!

2275
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:47,310
What the hell?

2276
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:52,290
Oh, I made a bit of a mess.

2277
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:53,030
I'm so sorry.

2278
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:55,030
Wanna listen to some compact records?

2279
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:55,790
No.

2280
02:17:58,130 --> 02:17:59,450
We'll keep this on.

2281
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:01,050
This is my favorite show too.

2282
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:04,170
The music is so silly.

2283
02:18:05,210 --> 02:18:07,710
For a long time after-

2284
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:20,740
Do the scientist.

2285
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:36,820
She's watching Minto on 3D.

2286
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:42,400
I mean when a cute girl asks if you want to listen to some
cute records with her, she...

2287
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:43,340
Never mind.

2288
02:18:53,010 --> 02:18:53,930
What's this?

2289
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:55,310
Nothing.

2290
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:58,350
This place is a humongous...

2291
02:18:59,130 --> 02:18:59,330
Oh.

2292
02:19:01,190 --> 02:19:01,790
Twister.

2293
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:07,570
Oh.

2294
02:19:08,810 --> 02:19:09,310
What?

2295
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:12,260
Bonus stage.

2296
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:13,740
Start.

2297
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,400

2298
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:20,100

2299
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:20,820
Claw everything!

2300
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:21,960

2301
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:27,300

2302
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,000

2303
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:32,860

2304
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:35,040
Yes, yes!

2305
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:36,020
Even the carpet!

2306
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:36,660
The carpet!

2307
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:39,180
It does take a sacred!

2308
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:40,100
I'm a cat!

2309
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:41,700
I don't care about monetary value!

2310
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,140
Yes!

2311
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:44,840
Yes!

2312
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:45,400
Yes!

2313
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:48,220
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2314
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:01,200
You know, sometimes I watch that video of that avocado kid.

2315
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:02,980
Like, the avocado, thanks!

2316
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:05,580
And I feel like, really, like, you know.

2317
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:08,860
Like, you know, I get it.

2318
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:10,320
I...

2319
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:14,640
I get it.

2320
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:17,740
I kind of, you know, I would appreciate, like, a banana or
something, too.

2321
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:19,060
Snuffle Munchkin!

2322
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:22,360
I missed my cat.

2323
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:23,340
Oh, I think he's back.

2324
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:32,280
Yes, I am the exterminator.

2325
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:34,680
Quick, look behind you.

2326
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:39,800
Over here, Polyblank.

2327
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:42,420
No, over here.

2328
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:42,860
No, no.

2329
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:43,940
A little more.

2330
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:45,460
A bit more.

2331
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:46,040
Okay.

2332
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:48,300
A little, a little to your left.

2333
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:50,640
No, your other left.

2334
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:53,700
Go back, go back a bit.

2335
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:55,740
Oh, there we go.

2336
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:56,600
Oh, my God, he's got a bag.

2337
02:20:56,980 --> 02:20:57,600
There we go.

2338
02:20:57,860 --> 02:20:58,140
All right.

2339
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:04,080
Ah, Polyblank, we've been expecting you.

2340
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:05,580
I'll get right to the point.

2341
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:09,100
You've taken something of mine, and so I've taken something
of yours.

2342
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:09,720
Yes.

2343
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:11,420
That's the overarching principle.

2344
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:12,120
Okay.

2345
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,360
What did I take?

2346
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:15,820
They've taken some of your important directors.

2347
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:16,760
I.E.

2348
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:17,300
me.

2349
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:18,100
Me?

2350
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:20,540
And it's imperative that you get me back in the right hands.

2351
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:21,360
I.E.

2352
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:22,260
My own.

2353
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:22,880
My own.

2354
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:23,140
Improvise.

2355
02:21:23,380 --> 02:21:24,560
I know you do well by me.

2356
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:25,100
Okay.

2357
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:28,160
Polyblank, I challenge you to...

2358
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:28,460
To?

2359
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:38,140

I think I only have one.

2363
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:08,200
I only have one option.

2364
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:12,520
Oh, my gosh.

2365
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:17,380
Oh, guys.

2366
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:19,820
We'll be fine.

2367
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:21,120
Probably.

2368
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:28,780
That didn't hit nearly as...

2369
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:35,540
Jelly.

2370
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,260
Oh my gosh, wait, he's in the jelly!

2371
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:41,680
Wait, oh no, that's the secretary in the jelly.

2372
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:44,360
Exciting.

2373
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:45,380
What's this?

2374
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:50,880
That's not gonna, like, lower when I get close, is it?

2375
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:53,540
What the?

2376
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:58,040
Oh, do I need to have this equipped?

2377
02:22:58,260 --> 02:22:58,960
Okay, here we go.

2378
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:02,600
The consequences are in your hands, Holy Rank.

2379
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:05,450
Come on, come on!

2380
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:11,240
Okay, just a little, just a little nudge.

2381
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:12,600
Like that.

2382
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:13,900
Maybe.

2383
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:16,860
Oh, too hard!

2384
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,900
Okay, less hard.

2385
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:22,840
Like that.

2386
02:23:30,580 --> 02:23:30,940
Ah!

2387
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:38,930
Lucky guy.

2390
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:13,000

right, all right, all right.

2391
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:17,060
Maybe, like, there.

2392
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:22,380
That was a bad shot.

2393
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:23,900
Can I do over?

2394
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:28,340
Wait, let me retry a little bit.

2395
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:33,380
Oh, that one wasn't so bad.

2396
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:34,100
That one's so bad.

2397
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:37,860
And then nice and easy.

2398
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:39,580
Straight in.

2399
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:41,820
Yeah!

2400
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:45,740
I wonder what...

2401
02:24:45,740 --> 02:24:47,300
I wonder what power is.

2402
02:24:56,020 --> 02:24:57,840
Luck appears to be on my side today.

2403
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:00,860
Yes.

2404
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:01,340
Luck.

2405
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,300
Does it just stab you with this or...

2406
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:11,200
Oh!

2407
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:12,380
That was a good shot.

2408
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:13,160
That was a good shot.

2409
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:15,200
Don't let it get you down, Polyblank.

2410
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:18,880
I'm doing fairly well, I'd say.

2411
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,280
I'd say, right?

2412
02:25:24,950 --> 02:25:26,770
I wonder what it's saying in Morse.

2413
02:25:27,650 --> 02:25:28,530
It's a good question.

2414
02:25:29,790 --> 02:25:29,990
Ah!

2415
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:31,790
That was in.

2416
02:25:31,890 --> 02:25:32,650
That was in.

2417
02:25:33,470 --> 02:25:34,650
Oh my gosh.

2418
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:37,870
We're just getting warmed up.

2419
02:25:38,510 --> 02:25:38,870
There's more?

2420
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:41,270
Follow me, and let us begin the gauntlet.

2421
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:42,830
The gauntlet?

2422
02:25:43,970 --> 02:25:44,350
Okay.

2423
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:47,070
Ladies first.

02:25:52,810 --> 02:26:07,730

course will require some recreational coagulant colloquially

2426
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:47,060
known as sports gravy sports now I'll allow you the honors

Oh shoot.

Oh my gosh.

2430
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:12,860
Oh, oh, oh shoot.

2431
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:14,360
That's not fair.

2432
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:15,620
Okay.

2433
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,240
Oh, drift.

2434
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:20,360
Drift.

2435
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:21,360
Drift.

2436
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:23,280
Yes!

2437
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,140
Lap too, baby.

2438
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:29,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2439
02:27:44,750 --> 02:27:46,110
I'm doomed.

2440
02:27:48,810 --> 02:27:49,830
Final lap.

2441
02:27:50,850 --> 02:27:51,430
We can make this.

2442
02:27:51,770 --> 02:27:52,410
We can make this.

2443
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:02,460
No, please!

2444
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:12,540
Yippee!

2445
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:15,020
You're not supposed to be able to win this.

2446
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:15,260
Oh.

2447
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:17,980
On to the next course.

2448
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:21,520
Oh.

2449
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:22,580
Okay.

2450
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:24,440
Okay.

2451
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:34,060
Easy?

2452
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:37,900
How much more of the game is left?

2453
02:28:39,100 --> 02:28:40,260
Oh, no, it's a virtual boy.

2454
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:42,720
Oh, okay.

2455
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:43,700
Okay.

2456
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:47,260
I'm the heavyweight champion.

2457
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:48,020
I'll let you know, though.

2458
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:49,460
However, I must warn you.

2459
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:51,680
I'm quite the Matrix Maverick.

2460
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:52,340
Not much.

2461
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:53,360
I'm like to call me.

2462
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:54,280
It didn't feel like it.

2463
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:00,000
Oh, press any button.

2464
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:09,060
Oh, yeah.

2465
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:25,670
Some of these, I don't know how I'm hitting them.

2466
02:29:26,230 --> 02:29:26,530
Wait!

2467
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:41,520
Oh, shoot.

2468
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:42,580
Uh oh.

2469
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:44,160
No!

2470
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:50,860
Did he just say that he's, that I'm not superior to him?

2471
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:52,740
Really?

2472
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:53,420
Oh, shoot.

2473
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:54,020
Oh, shoot.

2474
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:54,700
Where'd it go?

2475
02:29:55,960 --> 02:29:57,400
I can't see the ball.

2476
02:30:02,950 --> 02:30:05,090
I thought we were supposed to be punching each other.

2477
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:16,700
Guys, I'm not good at this.

2478
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:18,580
Wait, how did I get two?

2479
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:20,140
When did that happen?

2480
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:22,640
I'm the king of the worm.

2481
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:23,260
How did he?

2482
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:24,540
I'm a little worm.

2483
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:25,900
I'm a worm!

2484
02:30:27,640 --> 02:30:30,520
Oh, because I think his also went out of bounds at one
point.

2485
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:33,640
It needs to bounce, right?

2486
02:30:43,470 --> 02:30:44,290
Oh my gosh.

2487
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:47,570
I am very frustrated in my performance.

2488
02:30:47,950 --> 02:30:49,570
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2489
02:30:59,080 --> 02:30:59,880
to get.

2490
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:03,180
Uh-oh.

2491
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:03,940
Oh, that was close.

2492
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,460
His ego meter.

2493
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:14,620
I prefer to call this reverse winning.

2494
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:16,800
You get a little tomato like there, buddy.

2495
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:18,040
I believe you need to calibrate this thing.

2496
02:31:18,480 --> 02:31:20,420
There's no way you should have been able to win that.

2497
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,340
Ow, let me go on the first.

2498
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:23,700
First place for me!

2499
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:27,000
If you would be so kind, is to hand me my trophy.

2500
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:37,340
Water, you stupid.

2501
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:39,420
Oh my gosh, it's smart water.

2502
02:31:41,020 --> 02:31:41,500
No,

2503
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:46,740
no playing on the job.

2504
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,400
Oh, what's going on now?

2505
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:49,680
You should hop in.

2506
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:51,160
The water is perfect.

2507
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:53,380
Genocide!

2508
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:56,360
Whoa!

2509
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:00,980
Oh, gosh.

2510
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:02,380
I can't even get in.

2511
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:20,580
I'm so thirsty.

2512
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:24,440
Oh, um...

2513
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:25,440
Yeah, let me get you water.

2514
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,540
Let me get you water.

2515
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:30,620
Oh, here you go.

2516
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:33,740
Yes?

2517
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:34,580
You're thirsty?

2518
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:35,640
No?

2519
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:37,940
I did press the button.

2520
02:32:38,060 --> 02:32:38,480
Yeah, I did.

2521
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:41,000
Oh my gosh, we're getting so many items now all of a sudden.

2522
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:42,060
Okay.

2523
02:32:42,620 --> 02:32:43,780
We have so many things.

2524
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:49,310
Hand me my trophy.

2525
02:32:50,310 --> 02:32:52,170
Can I make him like a little...

2526
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:53,360
Oh, I'm Edward Scissorhands?

2527
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:00,880
He needs a belt!

2528
02:33:01,240 --> 02:33:03,120
His pants fall off!

2529
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:16,120
What the heck is that sound?

2530
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:22,620
If I hold the trophy, can I actually give it to him?

2531
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:26,780
No, interesting.

2532
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,840
Well, there's this... What are you doing?

2533
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:42,780
You want to give it a try?

2534
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:46,500
Get my virtue...

2535
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:49,520
I don't want to play again, though.

2536
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,910
Leave, please!

2537
02:34:00,470 --> 02:34:00,950
No!

2538
02:34:01,150 --> 02:34:01,810
Let me leave!

2539
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:02,970
No!

2540
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:04,910
There should be an exit button!

2541
02:34:05,110 --> 02:34:06,250
Please, let me leave!

2542
02:34:07,070 --> 02:34:07,710
Let me leave!

2543
02:34:09,010 --> 02:34:10,270
I already won!

2544
02:34:10,510 --> 02:34:10,990
Please!

2545
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:14,830
You will play the game and you will enjoy it!

2546
02:34:17,650 --> 02:34:19,650
How am I so good?

2547
02:34:20,370 --> 02:34:20,830
I mean, bad.

2548
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:28,620
It's okay.

2549
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:32,560
Just one more.

2550
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:36,760
Okay, good.

2551
02:34:40,490 --> 02:34:42,450
I'm super good at this.

2552
02:34:43,150 --> 02:34:44,290
I've got to kill you.

2553
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:48,230
Alright, I have all this stuff.

2554
02:34:50,550 --> 02:34:51,850
Hand me my trophy.

2555
02:34:56,390 --> 02:34:56,670
Okay.

2556
02:34:57,890 --> 02:35:01,280
Oh my gosh!

2557
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,660
Oopsie.

2558
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:07,380
You thirsty?

2559
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:11,380
Is this the trophy he wants?

2560
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:16,180
She said she was thirsty.

2561
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:21,440
But she doesn't want to drink.

2562
02:35:33,580 --> 02:35:35,680
Maybe I grabbed everything I could.

2563
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:43,180
I hear like a...

2564
02:35:43,180 --> 02:35:43,440
Whoa!

2565
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:48,270
Neat.

2566
02:35:49,830 --> 02:35:50,170
Eh?

2567
02:35:51,470 --> 02:35:53,190
Can you dunk the trophy?

2568
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:55,290
Let's try.

2569
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:57,210
Hmm.

2570
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:01,570
Oh, it literally is a blender.

2571
02:36:01,990 --> 02:36:02,750
That's crazy.

2572
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:09,390
You want this?

2573
02:36:09,570 --> 02:36:10,130
Or this?

2574
02:36:10,670 --> 02:36:11,250
Or this?

2575
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:11,410
Or this?

2576
02:36:11,990 --> 02:36:12,470
Anything?

2577
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:19,780
Oh, oh, I just realized there's this over here.

2578
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:22,160
Oh, wait, no, this is where I went to before.

2579
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:23,160
I'm silly.

2580
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:28,820
And we just drink that, so it's not like I can give it to
her.

2581
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:32,980
Why suddenly am I stuck?

2582
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:35,260
Up?

2583
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:38,880
Wait, can I drive this?

2584
02:36:48,660 --> 02:36:49,980
There's a brain in the water.

2585
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:50,700
Yeah, yeah.

2586
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:53,940
Oh, can I touch the cooler itself?

2587
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:55,160
Let's try it.

2588
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:01,870
Oh, I can!

2589
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:04,710
Oh, I didn't realize I could.

2590
02:37:06,010 --> 02:37:06,050
Oh.

2591
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:10,020
Oh.

2592
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:10,700
Oh.

2593
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:12,060
Rebooting brain.

2594
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:12,740
Oh.

2595
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:14,200
Oh.

2596
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:14,360
Oh.

2597
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:15,220
Whoa.

2598
02:37:17,020 --> 02:37:17,640
We

2599
02:37:47,710 --> 02:37:49,310
got the brain power.

2600
02:37:52,170 --> 02:37:53,670
Wait, you think it bugged?

2601
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:57,950

Wait, um...

2609
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:04,840

I feel like an absolute god.

2613
02:39:49,930 --> 02:39:50,870
Here we go!

2614
02:39:52,630 --> 02:39:54,550
You flatter me, Polyblank.

2615
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:55,210
Oh!

2616
02:39:57,170 --> 02:39:58,490
And you're...

2617
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:59,010
You're metal?

2618
02:39:59,110 --> 02:40:01,170
Oh, I don't deserve such an accolade.

2619
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:08,370
He doesn't want the promiscuous polynomials.

2620
02:40:11,030 --> 02:40:11,830
Uh...

2621
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:15,290
Wait, do I need one more?

2622
02:40:16,730 --> 02:40:17,590
Was there something else?

2623
02:40:17,770 --> 02:40:19,170
Or maybe I give him the trophy now.

2624
02:40:24,970 --> 02:40:26,150
There we go.

2625
02:40:27,050 --> 02:40:27,490
Ha-ya!

2626
02:40:34,330 --> 02:40:35,270
Save the director.

2627
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:36,030
Save the director.

2628
02:40:37,330 --> 02:40:38,550
You want to give it a try?

2629
02:40:40,450 --> 02:40:41,510
Where's the director at?

2630
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:42,530
How do I save him?

2631
02:40:44,210 --> 02:40:45,450
How do I get to the director?

2632
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:48,050
Uh...

2633
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:53,010
Uh...

2634
02:40:53,010 --> 02:40:53,770
Save the director.

2635
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:54,670
Okay, okay.

2636
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:56,630
Maybe this car instead.

2637
02:40:58,530 --> 02:41:00,210
Get back to the direct...

2638
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:01,230
Save the...

2639
02:41:01,930 --> 02:41:02,530
Director!

2640
02:41:03,170 --> 02:41:03,590
Director!

2641
02:41:04,170 --> 02:41:06,350
Director, I don't know how to drive a car anymore!

2642
02:41:07,750 --> 02:41:08,450
I'm blind?

2643
02:41:08,890 --> 02:41:09,390
Wait, am I?

2644
02:41:09,530 --> 02:41:10,210
Where is he?

2645
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:14,790
Do you know?

2646
02:41:15,650 --> 02:41:16,730
Follow the words?

2647
02:41:17,810 --> 02:41:18,410
Oh!

2648
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:24,870
My bad.

2649
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:26,810
Excuse me.

2650
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:28,270
Uh-oh.

2651
02:41:28,470 --> 02:41:28,990
Bird strike.

2652
02:41:30,130 --> 02:41:30,730
Bird strike.

2653
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:34,290
We're fine.

2654
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,020
Chop, chop, chop!

2655
02:41:46,690 --> 02:41:48,650
26 hours later?

2656
02:41:49,690 --> 02:41:51,210
The director is ready for you.

2657
02:41:52,190 --> 02:41:52,810
Thank you.

2658
02:41:53,910 --> 02:41:55,930
Consume vast quantities of jelly.

2659
02:41:56,770 --> 02:41:59,810
It seems they've got me suspended in some sort of a...

2660
02:42:01,630 --> 02:42:02,110
Whiskey.

2661
02:42:03,370 --> 02:42:03,850
Crockification.

2662
02:42:03,850 --> 02:42:04,950
I call a whiskey.

2663
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:06,050
Holy blank.

2664
02:42:06,410 --> 02:42:08,510
Please save me before I drink the whole thing.

2665
02:42:10,990 --> 02:42:11,370
What the...

2666
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:12,690
You could become a crocodile.

2667
02:42:25,220 --> 02:42:27,240
Any, many, many, many more.

2668
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:29,220
Pick...

2669
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:30,400
Wait, wait.

2670
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:33,520
Save and load.

2671
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:35,160
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

2672
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:36,920
Oh!

2673
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:39,080
Oh, Gatorite!

2674
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:44,700
Sorry, old Sam, but a crock's got to do what a crock's got
to do.

2675
02:42:45,140 --> 02:42:49,020
I mean, you might as well crawl in my mouth now, because
it's only going to end one way.

2676
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:49,780
No way.

2677
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:51,940
Ah, shucks.

2678
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:55,540
Do I have anything I can give him?

2679
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:56,340
Let's see.

2680
02:42:56,660 --> 02:42:58,780
Uh, is that butter?

2681
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:01,560
Oh.

2682
02:43:07,420 --> 02:43:09,640
Oh, I'm drinking that!

2683
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:12,080
Oh, okay.

2684
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:23,210
One final drink.

2685
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:26,750
Wow, it's bigger on the inside.

2686
02:43:27,970 --> 02:43:28,750
Can I punch that?

2687
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:30,990
Give you a little bit of heartburn.

2688
02:43:35,570 --> 02:43:36,670
This is it!

2689
02:43:38,190 --> 02:43:39,710
One but a good one.

2690
02:43:48,210 --> 02:43:50,330
We did it!

2691
02:43:50,750 --> 02:43:52,970
We did it!

2692
02:43:53,630 --> 02:43:53,890
Oh.

2693
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:02,670
Uh-oh.

2694
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:04,490
I don't like the look of that.

2695
02:44:05,790 --> 02:44:06,450
Okay, whew.

2696
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:18,540
This game was so silly.

2697
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:26,680
I wish I had a little more time to take my time with some of
the parts, but I feel like I was pretty good at exploring a

2698
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:27,060
lot of stuff.

2699
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:27,360
All right.

2700
02:44:28,060 --> 02:44:29,100
My sincerest apologies.

2701
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:35,480
I've left this tech recording here in the event that I ever
get transmogrified into a man-reptile hybrid, and you need

2702
02:44:35,480 --> 02:44:37,940
to escape the labyrinth that is my digestive system.

2703
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:40,280
I've provided some specially encoded people.

2704
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:40,980
I got a lot of it.

2705
02:44:41,060 --> 02:44:41,460
Oh, okay.

2706
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:41,720
Awesome.

2707
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:43,620
That takes me many.

2708
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:45,280
Oh, and just a warning.

2709
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:47,920
I have a particularly violent immune system.

2710
02:44:51,220 --> 02:45:04,240
uh-oh also please say hi to my secretary if i eat her for
pudding if i eat her for pudding three two one

2711
02:45:08,120 --> 02:45:19,220

is i wish that there was a way to adjust the audio but how

2712
02:45:19,220 --> 02:45:20,040
it looks like.

2713
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:24,540
Yeah, I was so goofy.

2714
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:27,620
That was so silly.

2715
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:29,200
That was a good one.

2716
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:30,440
I had fun with that one.

2717
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:32,680
It was just the right amount of silliness.

2718
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:37,900
Right on time.

2719
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:38,560
