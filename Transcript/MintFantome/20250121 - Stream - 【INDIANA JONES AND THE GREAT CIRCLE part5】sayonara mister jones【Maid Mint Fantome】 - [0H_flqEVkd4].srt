1
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,780
Welcome back!

2
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,160
Welcome back!

3
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,160
Hello!

4
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,860
Hi, I'm Mikana Jones.

5
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,820
Howdy.

6
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Howdy... y'all.

7
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
Welcome... to...

8
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
Which is probably... possibly... I don't know.

9
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,160
Probably the last Indiana Jones stream.

10
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,920
Vodgang...

11
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,760
Don't...

12
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,820
If I'm...

13
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,460
Vodgang, tell me if I'm correct or not.

14
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,160
Vodgang checking in.

15
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,280
You're literally here, what are you talking about?

16
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,520
You can do it in about 6 hours.

17
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,380
Okay.

18
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,460
I think I can do that.

19
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,080
Oh my god.

20
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,200
Did you hear my tummy?

21
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,700
It went...

22
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,260
Howdy minky, howdy runny-chan, thanks for 4 months!

23
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,920
Thank you!

24
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,260
Thanks for the 5 gifts, dude!

25
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,600
Howdy-dee megadoodoo.

26
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,540
Howdy-dee megadoodoo.

27
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,660
Trying to go until I finish, basically.

28
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,600
As much as I love the game...

29
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,760
It's one of those, you know, I'm ready to start a new series.

30
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,300
Kind of dealio.

31
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,280
So...

32
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,940
Kind of dealio, I'm ready to move on!

33
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,320
What?

34
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,080
It's been like 2 months of this game, I feel.

35
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,680
Jerry, thank you for the 10 gifted!

36
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,460
Thank you!

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Mr. Albeezy, welcome back!

38
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,640
Hello, hello, hello.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
VOD viewer here.

40
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,480
This is important.

41
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,160
Don't forget to...

42
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,240
Forget to what?

43
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,460
Weapon!

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,360
Mr. Albeezy, thank you for the 10 gifted!

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,940
Apparently, hand kill is going to be in Fortnite.

46
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,840
When will Indiana Jones be in Fortnite?

47
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,780
I wonder.

48
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,860
But no, I've been having so much fun with this game, so...

49
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,240
I am sad to finish it, but...

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,140
I'm also just excited to see how it ends, honestly.

51
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,980
Gosh, what happened last time?

52
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,380
We fought a giant.

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
I do remember that.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,980
Wait, he was?

55
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
Indiana Jones was in Fortnite!

56
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,380
Twice!

57
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,360
They added Indy ages ago!

58
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,220
Won't leave the room.

59
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,540
Cat.

60
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,200
Yeah, my cat!

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,140
She is... Pauses in here.

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Which means she will probably start screaming at me in about 20 minutes.

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,040
We'll see.

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
What time is it?

65
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,080
Okay.

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,700
Let's... Countdown.

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,980
Fake fan, SMH.

68
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,100
Well, I guess you could say I am a fake fan of Fortnite.

69
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,120
That is true.

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,940
I am maybe a fake fan of Fortnite.

71
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,740
Don't spoil the final boss.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
I don't know anything!

73
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,540
I don't know anything!

74
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,320
I don't know anything!

75
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,780
I don't even know who is still playing this game.

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,160
Anymore.

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,240
It's me.

78
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,140
I'm the only one still playing this game, maybe.

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,200
I meant I became a hag today.

80
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,200
It would mean a lot if I could get a happy birthday from my Kamiyoshi!

81
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,100
I've been looking forward to it.

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,760
Of course, Nexie!

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,960
Happy birthday to you!

84
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,620
Happy birthday to you!

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,680
Happy birthday, Nexie hag!

86
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,240
Happy birthday to you!

87
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,540
You finished it a couple of days ago.

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,060
You liked it?

89
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,560
Okay, maybe I'll like it too then.

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,380
Good morning!

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,000
Good morning, good morning, Miss Koiu!

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,900
Bionic Hippo, welcome back!

93
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,260
Alright.

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,780
I heard Paws chirp.

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
No you didn't!

96
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,160
No you didn't.

97
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,980
I see her still laying in her bed.

98
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,980
She is still laying in her bed.

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,740
I thought though recently... She really loves to look out the window, right?

100
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,700
I think... I think I'm gonna have to get her one of those...

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,200
Beds that...

102
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,660
Stick to the window.

103
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,220
Who's Paws?

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,960
My cat!

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,480
That's my cat.

106
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,000
But I'm afraid of those.

107
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,000
Because I'm afraid that they will fall, you know?

108
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,120
The balcony... Is that what it's called?

109
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,760
So hyped to see Minto together with Indy.

110
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,640
Yeah, we're right together.

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,440
We got the same hat and everything.

112
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,580
I got my little whip.

113
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,640
You know.

114
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,900
Hold on.

115
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,370
Sorry, I got...

116
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,450
I think I got food stuck in my throat.

117
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,070
Now...

118
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,850
You got your whip and your nae nae?

119
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,690
I got my whip.

120
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,310
I got my nae nae.

121
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,730
I got my whip.

122
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,350
Whip.

123
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,610
I got my nae nae.

124
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,870
Alright.

125
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,790
What happened last time?

126
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,340
What happened last time?

127
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,400
We had... Okay, actually I do remember.

128
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,800
Thank you.

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,640
I remember.

130
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,760
Hold on.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,520
Not you.

132
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,400
We were going to do this...

133
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,140
Maybe the study in fear?

134
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,420
Whatever is that one that I'm pointing to.

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,160
That must be the study in fear.

136
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,900
Wasn't I going to go do that real quick and then we were going to continue the actual adventure?

137
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,460
Or was it the lost... No, not lost.

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,320
I was down here because I was going to do that.

139
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,460
And then...

140
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,660
The blessed pearl.

141
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,500
Do you guys say blessed or blessed?

142
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,820
I think I say either one.

143
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,980
Whatever I feel like.

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
The blessed pearl is the actual adventure.

145
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,280
So we were going to just go do this one so we could get some money, money, baby.

146
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,160
And then...

147
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,580
This one?

148
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,580
What was this one?

149
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,040
Oh, the girl in the cave.

150
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,180
She helped the demon and got a golden fishing hook.

151
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,260
Depends on the context.

152
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,540
Depends on if I want to be fun.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,880
Blessed for D&D RP.

154
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Blessed for normal.

155
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
If I'm old timey, blessed.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,580
I got it.

157
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,200
Study and fear is a nice quest.

158
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,780
Is it really?

159
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,340
Maybe we will do it then.

160
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,660
I don't really have a time limit or anything today.

161
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,860
I just, you know...

162
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Are you not coming with?

163
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,140
Wait, where...

164
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,220
OK.

165
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,580
Bye bye.

166
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,120
God, she's so fast.

167
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,320
What?

168
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,980
What hamatat?

169
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,820
That's what we're gonna go do.

170
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,580
Yeah, I know.

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,500
We're going.

172
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,400
Yeah, we can just go this way.

173
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,440
So we found the big, big temple.

174
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,640
And we went inside and I parkoured and I punched a snake.

175
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,920
And...

176
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,620
And...

177
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,940
We fought a giant.

178
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
We solved a puzzle.

179
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,800
And now we're on the...

180
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,280
We're on the river.

181
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,880
We're on the river.

182
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,200
Why is the music so spooky?

183
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,160
Shut up Xbox.

184
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,040
Shut up Xbox.

185
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,340
Xbox.

186
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,660
Why is the music so scary?

187
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,980
Oh, wrong way, wrong way.

188
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,260
Yeah, we're down, down, down by the river.

189
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,940
I actually got my new PC, right?

190
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,660
And I was considering playing the game on my new PC.

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,780
Oh, it must be over there.

192
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,660
But I have some issues, so...

193
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,140
I have some issues with some of my fans.

194
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,500
So I had to get a new part.

195
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,420
So basically, I kinda went, I don't know, I kinda went a little fancy.

196
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,960
With lights and stuff.

197
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,280
And I accidentally got some fans that are a little fancier than I wanted.

198
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,020
But that's okay because I like them.

199
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
Can I get up in there?

200
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,580
I think so.

201
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,060
But...

202
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,860
But I think they're not getting enough power.

203
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
What's this music?

204
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,820
I'm scared.

205
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,500
I feel like I'm getting discovered.

206
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,900
You think we can go in there?

207
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Or should I go...

208
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,820
A little bit more.

209
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,920
Let's go a little bit more.

210
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,920
No, it's not.

211
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,840
It's...

212
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,200
Basically...

213
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,840
I didn't...

214
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,860
I didn't get the...it's not a controller.

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't remember what it's called.

216
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:22,960
Oh, nice.

217
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,320
Here we go.

218
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Okay, dock the boat.

219
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,560
I don't remember.

220
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,620
Sorry guys, I'm actually trying to pilot and find this place while also explaining.

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,440
What?

222
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,100
What are you talking about?

223
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,220
Okay, I also don't remember how to fight.

224
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,660
Okay, I remember how to fight.

225
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,420
She is...Gina is so confusing.

226
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,020
She cracks me up though.

227
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,260
Wait, they'll shoot us?

228
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,100
Is that what you just said?

229
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,720
Devil?

230
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,740
A devil.

231
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,680
That which is predestined.

232
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,940
But it's not for this reason, evil.

233
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,360
Okay, Andy.

234
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,180
Are there people here?

235
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm scared.

236
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,860
I thought I heard someone whistling.

237
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,440
Gina.

238
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,740
Gina, I'm scared.

239
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,940
I don't want to get exploded.

240
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Or shot.

241
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,940
Fan here.

242
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,900
I'm sorry, I have issues.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,840
I'll go to therapy.

244
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,180
Oh my god.

245
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,840
Investigate the temple grounds.

246
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,200
Gina.

247
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,540
Gina, please.

248
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,020
Gina, I need some moral support.

249
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,720
I need a woman's touch.

250
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,140
She's really just sitting here.

251
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,680
Okay, fine.

252
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,080
Whatever.

253
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,160
What if there are snakes?

254
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,160
Okay, I'm investigating.

255
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,020
Yeah.

256
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,520
Dead, I hope.

257
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,820
Yeah, so true.

258
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,500
So true.

259
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,340
What am I doing?

260
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,920
Investigate the temple grounds.

261
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,180
Okay.

262
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,280
In here?

263
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
What else is around here?

264
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,400
A little water bottle.

265
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,280
A gun?

266
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,820
I will gladly acquire.

267
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,080
So true, bestie.

268
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,580
Come here.

269
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,280
That, I think, is a peacock.

270
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,400
My neighbor used to have peacocks.

271
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,430
I'm treasuring them.

272
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,290
Alright, let's go in.

273
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,310
How do I get out once I go in?

274
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,850
That's for future Indy to worry about.

275
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,490
Oh gosh, why am I so scared all of a sudden of this game?

276
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,810
We're in the vault?

277
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,170
Okay.

278
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,150
Wow, you don't want a picture of this?

279
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,210
Not interesting enough for you, Indiana Jones?

280
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:29,830
Okay.

281
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,730
Maybe they got scared.

282
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,430
Maybe they got scared of something.

283
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,470
Or they got sucked in.

284
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,790
Here we go!

285
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,590
I

286
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,220
mean, yes, shoot, but...oh shoot.

287
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,240
No, why?

288
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,320
You're just whistling.

289
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,840
Your friends are dead and you're whistling?

290
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,040
Whistling?

291
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,820
The shoulder pad is so good.

292
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,300
How do I drop this gun?

293
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,760
Hold on, crouch.

294
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,540
There we go.

295
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,060
Whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle.

296
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,280
Maybe it wasn't me.

297
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,560
Maybe I was the one whistling.

298
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,100
Oh my god.

299
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, okay.

300
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,620
I like her pants.

301
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,060
Yeah.

302
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,180
Annika.

303
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,460
Annika Lund.

304
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,360
Yeah.

305
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,740
That's awkward.

306
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,220
You're our student?

307
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,560
Uh oh.

308
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,120
You're our student and you literally use explosives?

309
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,080
Okay.

310
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,840
She's gonna betray us, isn't she?

311
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,520
I'm gonna have to punch a woman.

312
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,380
Look at her.

313
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,240
She already looks like she's contemplating how to betray me.

314
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,740
Give me your fire.

315
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,340
Give me your fire.

316
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,440
There we go.

317
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
Alright, set her on fire.

318
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,920
Literally, she does not give anything.

319
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,300
She does not care at all about those guys that died.

320
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm... you... you!

321
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,220
No!

322
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,000
She has the nerve to say... oh man.

323
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,520
She has the nerve to say that when she used explosives to get in here in the first place.

324
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,480
She's like, I'm innocent.

325
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,540
I'm an innocent person whistling.

326
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
I would never betray you, Dr. Jones.

327
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,640
Resting betrayer face.

328
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,500
She's got them... she's got them... what's it called?

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,260
Them seppuku eyes.

330
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,180
Sanpaku eyes.

331
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,640
She was... she's...

332
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,900
The whistle of a betrayer.

333
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,960
She's like, whistle, whistle.

334
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm an innocent girl.

335
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,980
Sudoku eyes.

336
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,140
What did I just open?

337
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,880
Oh, what the hell is that?

338
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,200
Give it to me.

339
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh.

340
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,640
What?

341
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,060
This girl's stupid.

342
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,600
We RBFers don't claim it.

343
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,540
What if she's good?

344
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm guessing Anika is the student that passed with a C-.

345
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,540
She was busy...

346
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,260
It's not a key.

347
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,060
Actually, I think you're right.

348
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,100
What do I... oh, do I have to make them align?

349
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
Where's this... wait.

350
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,480
Do I make them align?

351
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,300
Yeah, I know.

352
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,420
Yeah, I will.

353
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,980
What legend?

354
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,200
True.

355
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,300
Okay, Anika, I know you want out.

356
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,080
She did not seem worried at all about being able to get out of here or not.

357
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,500
She truly was just like...

358
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,620
What the hell?

359
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,200
What is all this?

360
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,620
Oh, now she's sighing.

361
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,860
Okay, now you're impatient?

362
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:08,940
Impatient!

363
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,340
Is this game good, Mint?

364
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,360
Also, why is Meido Minto so fun to say?

365
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,720
I think it's fun.

366
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,740
I think if you like Indiana Jones, you will enjoy it.

367
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,680
If you're an Indiana Joey...

368
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,700
What'd she say?

369
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,620
I know there is.

370
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
A lever?

371
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,060
Wait, a lever where?

372
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,960
Stop the cogwheels.

373
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,340
Gamer pain!

374
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Am I doing it?

375
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,420
Oh, what?

376
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,540
Okay, hold on.

377
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,420
Let's try over here.

378
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,760
We'll wait.

379
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,280
We'll wait.

380
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:19,300
He needs to kill people!

381
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,120
Did we get it?

382
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,880
It's quiet now.

383
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,520
It's nice and quiet.

384
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,880
Another key.

385
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,020
Hmm.

386
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,080
Are we?

387
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,840
Yank!

388
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh!

389
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,580
I'm breaking things.

390
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,040
They died, but they're go... Oh, I needed that to move it!

391
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,120
I'm such a smarty pants, aren't I?

392
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,430
Oh, and then... How do I switch to the other one?

393
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,310
I got my bread.

394
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,830
Where is the other cross?

395
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,070
This circle.

396
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,990
The great circle!

397
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,770
Frosty, thanks for 7 months!

398
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,230
I don't like nachos either, but it's a colossal red flag.

399
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,990
You are my student!

400
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,710
Annika!

401
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,850
How do you whistle like that?

402
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,630
How do you whistle without...

403
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,430
How do you whistle without doing...

404
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,210
I can take a picture of her?

405
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,730
Ooh, hot mama!

406
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,850
I'm taking a picture of...

407
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,470
Ahem, to you!

408
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,190
Gosh, she's so...

409
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,510
Okay.

410
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,970
No, we want the...

411
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,950
I was just holding it.

412
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,250
The circle.

413
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:16,550
Okay.

414
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,430
Oh.

415
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,350
Oh no, that didn't work at all.

416
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:21,890
Nevermind.

417
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,810
How do I get the... Wait.

418
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,830
Am I stupid?

419
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:27,870
The cross.

420
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
How do I get the middle?

421
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:31,490
Wait.

422
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,350
Okay, we gotta... Oh, we just gotta time it to this one then.

423
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,630
I'm smart.

424
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,790
Don't worry guys.

425
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,850
I've got a good...

426
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,310
I've got a brain.

427
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,770
It works!

428
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,710
Yeah, I'm a genius!

429
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,330
Indiana U genius.

430
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,730
Yeah, we just crouch.

431
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,310
I wish we had our...

432
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,510
I love the way she runs.

433
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,610
It's so funny.

434
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,670
Indiana U genius.

435
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,590
I think there's any little artifacts.

436
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,510
That doesn't look good.

437
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,750
Oh my god.

438
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:25,970
Ah!

439
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,410
Ah!

440
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:27,770
Ah!

441
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,550
She's trying to kill me.

442
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,670
She's trying to kill me for real.

443
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,810
Oh my god.

444
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,810
That spooked me.

445
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,570
That spooked the heck out of me.

446
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,550
Oh, I can't... Okay.

447
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,450
Yeah, no shit!

448
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,250
Oh my god!

449
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,430
She's worse than Gina!

450
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,970
I don't think we should have passed her.

451
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,270
I think...

452
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,850
I think she shouldn't have passed the class.

453
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,350
Anika, I'm taking back your degree.

454
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,910
Stop whistling on the job please.

455
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,450
Oh, you're gonna drive me crazy.

456
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,750
I thought I was so lucky to be...

457
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,750
To be stuck in here with such a beautiful lady, but...

458
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,270
Why is there gamer paint on this?

459
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,090
There's nowhere to go.

460
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,550
I used to be a big fan of Mint.

461
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,230
But after watching her for longer, I'm now a whole air conditioner.

462
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,880
That's a good one.

463
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,700
That's a good one.

464
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,800
Who's saying she passed?

465
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,940
Indy clearly doesn't remember.

466
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,220
True.

467
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,760
Wait, shouldn't you be doing the spooking here?

468
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,640
I don't haunt this place.

469
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,640
Why were you searching for this anyway?

470
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,320
True.

471
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,780
True.

472
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,440
She's giving... She's serving face or something.

473
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,500
Girly?

474
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,780
I'm just looking around.

475
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,980
I like the...

476
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,340
I don't... Indy...

477
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,160
Gamers never look up except when it's literally a death trap.

478
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,080
Indy, I don't think we should open this.

479
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,920
Indiana Jones.

480
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,680
The wall, the ceiling is Swiss cheese.

481
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,260
Look, that's gonna literally lower.

482
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:54,980
Okay, hold on.

483
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,560
We gotta look at our escape route.

484
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,980
We gotta look for an escape route before we do this, right?

485
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,260
Something.

486
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,020
Something.

487
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,740
Something.

488
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,080
Maybe I can...

489
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,300
Something.

490
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,880
Something.

491
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,660
Okay.

492
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,180
I'm prepared to die.

493
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,920
I've made my amends.

494
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,640
What are you looking at?

495
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,620
I don't see anything.

496
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm gonna get on top.

497
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,840
Just kidding.

498
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,340
Okay.

499
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,940
I don't wanna get on top anymore.

500
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,740
I don't... What do you mean this... Okay, hold on.

501
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,300
We are parkouring.

502
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,280
What could be a way to open this?

503
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,600
The light hits the mushroom.

504
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,200
Something here, yeah.

505
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,500
Break dancing on the sarcophagus.

506
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,170
Oh, I see it.

507
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,390
I did it.

508
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,030
I found it.

509
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,110
I found it.

510
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,110
Perfect.

511
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,570
Not very secure, but it took me a second to find it.

512
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,910
Okay.

513
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,410
I saved.

514
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,850
I like the locks.

515
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,810
They are very cute, right?

516
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,070
Just got in.

517
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,530
What did I miss?

518
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,410
Not much, actually.

519
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,870
We just met this lady.

520
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,830
She is one of our old students, apparently.

521
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,630
It's empty.

522
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:45,750
Empty.

523
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,530
Your soul died.

524
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,770
This looks breakable, right?

525
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,550
Yeah!

526
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,680
This is...

527
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,660
Yeah!

528
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,620
Break it!

529
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,440
Break it!

530
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,020
Break it with your fist!

531
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,880
Break it with...

532
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
This!

533
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,840
Break it with this!

534
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,960
I messed up.

535
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,020
Oh god!

536
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,440
It's really filling up fast.

537
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,040
Why is it so steamy?

538
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,720
Wait!

539
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,120
This way!

540
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,840
This way!

541
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,260
This way!

542
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,660
Oh my god.

543
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,980
No, there is no way we are going to make it.

544
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,340
I'm trapped.

545
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,920
Wait, can I swim down?

546
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,340
There we go.

547
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,820
Wait, how do I...

548
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,720
X to something.

549
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,620
Lift!

550
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,140
We are not dying today, baby!

551
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,140
Oh, they are Anika, baby.

552
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,320
Oh my god.

553
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,720
Why would I want to drop down?

554
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,200
Sayonara!

555
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,800
Why would I want to do that?

556
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:21,700
Hello?

557
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,740
Indiana Jones.

558
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,580
Get back up there.

559
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,680
No, Indy.

560
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,040
Indy, get back up there.

561
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,380
What am I

562
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:38,610
doing?

563
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,430
Oh, it's just a ketchup red.

564
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,390
We are continuing...

565
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:46,910
Oh, this way.

566
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,450
There she is.

567
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,310
Oh, she didn't betray us.

568
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,990
She didn't betray us.

569
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,410
What if I miss?

570
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,310
She has a white T-shirt on, right?

571
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,510
Alright.

572
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,930
We are still...

573
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,990
That would have been unfortunate.

574
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,570
Anika, you are freaking me out.

575
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,570
That?

576
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,830
That looks like a door?

577
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,270
Retro.

578
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:52,990
Okay.

579
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,990
She doesn't have much worldly experience, I'm afraid.

580
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,550
She is young and trusts so easily.

581
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,490
Yeah, she is very trusting.

582
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,650
She is maybe a little gullible.

583
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,230
Okay, we gotta go over up here.

584
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,150
What's in...

585
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,910
A secret found!

586
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,150
We got...

587
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,950
Beautiful.

588
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,350
We got a little Among Us.

589
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,590
I probably could have lowered a little bit, but...

590
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,250
I took a chance.

591
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:38,290
Nice.

592
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,890
Wait, how do I lower...

593
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,810
There we go.

594
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,950
What's on the other side?

595
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,570
Oh, sorry, Endy.

596
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,610
How do you...oh.

597
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,790
I can't get up here.

598
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,170
She is kind of funny.

599
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,570
I can't get up here.

600
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,330
I gotta take a...

601
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,010
Oh, little girl.

602
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,190
Come on.

603
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,890
Come on, little girl.

604
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,830
My cat went out of the room.

605
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,470
Hold on.

606
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,520
Okie dokie.

607
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,440
What am I taking a picture of?

608
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,480
What am I taking a picture of?

609
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,900
Oh, the watermelon.

610
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,820
Where we almost died.

611
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,920
Snap.

612
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,960
Why did they build any of this, Endy?

613
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,300
I have many questions.

614
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,820
Wait, are we trying to pull her up or...

615
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,740
You gotta come over here, Annika.

616
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,440
Ok, and...

617
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,980
What's this?

618
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,080
Nothing, it appears.

619
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,540
What am I...

620
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,820
Where is...is there an entrance?

621
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,500
It looked like I needed to come over here, though.

622
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,320
I don't think...this is down into the river where we just came from, so definitely not that.

623
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,560
What?

624
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,300
Help Annika?

625
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,360
Do I help her out first?

626
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,200
Oh, ok.

627
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,820
Yeah, I do.

628
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,320
Come on up.

629
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,560
Oh,

630
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
there was a thing right here.

631
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,620
Oh, ok.

632
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,040
Go!

633
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,960
Yeah, it is the Temple of Doom outfit.

634
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,440
TV table tray, thanks for the cat.

635
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
Just figured out how to send this 9 months later.

636
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,660
Thanks Boobies!

637
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,140
This is definitely it.

638
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,600
Having a look around.

639
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,960
Oh, more of these guys.

640
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,680
They are so cute.

641
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,560
What am I hearing?

642
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,340
Oh, this thing.

643
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,960
Ok.

644
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:01,980
Yes!

645
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,500
Take!

646
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,340
What do you mean not that?

647
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,520
What are you talking about, Indy?

648
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,300
I literally did it.

649
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,560
We have to bring water to this one.

650
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,580
And this one.

651
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,560
Water, water.

652
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,220
Is this like the previous puzzle?

653
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,780
We did one last time where I had to redirect a bunch of water.

654
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:28,880
Minky?

655
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,060
Oh, he said not bad.

656
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,960
Ah,

657
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,120
the demon giant.

658
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,660
So mean.

659
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,940
Once we find the horrible ugly guy, we can leave.

660
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,090
Yeah, you jump over that.

661
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,710
Oh I see the blood.

662
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,730
Yeah, I got it.

663
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,770
Oh, it's disgusting.

664
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,970
Oh gosh, nasty.

665
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,190
Ok, now this one should be spin, spin, spinning.

666
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,350
Yes indeedy.

667
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,650
Wait, I had it good actually.

668
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,650
Yeah?

669
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,890
Oh!

670
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,430
How do I...

671
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,890
What do you want me to do?

672
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,890
Oh, it was a bird, not a...

673
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,310
Destroy the nest!

674
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,730
Thanks for two vents.

675
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,350
Do you want me to parkour over there?

676
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,710
There's no way.

677
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,570
How do you want me to get that bird?

678
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,530
It was not a minky.

679
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,940
Do a flip.

680
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,660
I could very well do that.

681
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,760
Ok, I got up to this ledge.

682
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,480
Maybe right this here?

683
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,640
No.

684
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,060
Oh, no, no, no.

685
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,660
This ledge?

686
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,820
Oh, so close, so close.

687
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,160
So close.

688
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,280
Oh my god.

689
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,060
I don't think this is how you are supposed to do it, but...

690
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,940
This is how we are going to do it.

691
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
Anika, get on my shoulders.

692
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,080
Come on.

693
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,960
Come on!

694
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,180
I don't see a demon giant, but a freaky baby.

695
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,060
Oh,

696
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,960
it does both of them.

697
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,480
Interesting.

698
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,960
Which actually, this...

699
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,920
Oh wait, but the one that we have...

700
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,880
Oh, this one.

701
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,340
I forgot it does the middle.

702
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,420
Oh wait, why did this...

703
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,060
Ok.

704
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,680
Oh, that's not what I expected.

705
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,530
That did it, baby.

706
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,190
Now you...

707
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,570
I'm such a genius.

708
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,590
Wait, but this one will do the two of them.

709
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,110
Or this one will do two of them, right?

710
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,490
Ok?

711
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,150
Ok, ok.

712
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,790
And then what did this one do?

713
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,670
Oh, just the middle two.

714
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,470
I think we gotta...

715
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,190
Oh, my bad.

716
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,170
Oh, now it's all out of sync.

717
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,190
But I think we gotta time it to the...

718
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,110
to the outside one.

719
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,310
We gotta time...

720
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:51,950
Is it this one?

721
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,180
There we go.

722
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,080
Still got it.

723
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah, I do.

724
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,160
Is that supposed...

725
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,240
Circle key.

726
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,280
What?

727
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,280
I'm surprised all of this wood still works.

728
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,000
You know what I mean?

729
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,780
Like it's...

730
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,240
The fact that it's not rotted and like everything is kind of crazy.

731
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,840
Oh, wow!

732
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,920
That's kind of insane!

733
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,380
Get out of my shot!

734
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,180
You found it?

735
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,380
Excuse me, ma'am?

736
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,720
Whoa...

737
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,200
Whoa...

738
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,160
Oh, I'll take that.

739
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,480
That looks like that's probably mine.

740
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,320
Annika?

741
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,260
Annika, you better not put that in your pocket.

742
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,820
Thank you for the super chat, Okami!

743
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,380
Appreciate it.

744
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,780
Whatcha got there?

745
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,040
Ah,

746
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:52,040
a duck.

747
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:53,940
Oh.

748
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,080
Watching this whole arena reminded me that when I discovered VTubers, I thought that backseating meant doing just that.

749
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,060
And I was having a chat to make sure I'm not kicking my teeth.

750
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,840
Wait, doing what?

751
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,360
Yeah, yeah.

752
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,200
I agree.

753
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,060
Why does she look at me like that?

754
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,530
She's moonwalking.

755
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,470
Oh, he will.

756
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:43,930
What?

757
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,090
She's not going to betray me!

758
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,350
Maybe I'm naive for trusting her.

759
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,690
Ancient idol is an obtuse way of saying ghost...

760
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,350
What are you...

761
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:03,490
Yep.

762
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,570
Why is it a cutscene?

763
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,550
Fool me once!

764
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:12,970
Oh no.

765
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,930
Mufasa, I mean, Asgore, help me!

766
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,110
Remembered me even.

767
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,750
I might have been working for you.

768
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,150
Class dismissed.

769
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,670
Professor Jones.

770
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,930
Long live the king!

771
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,330
Oh come on!

772
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,150
Wait.

773
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,500
I caught you, bitch!

774
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,860
No, I'm Indiana Jones!

775
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,660
I thought backseating meant just watching and not typing.

776
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,860
Oh no, that's such a sad experience.

777
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,520
Dusty dog.

778
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,420
Welcome to membership.

779
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,080
Thank you.

780
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,960
Oh, there we go.

781
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,120
For some reason I thought it was telling me to...

782
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,480
light a lighter.

783
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,040
Alternatively, I'm done saving you.

784
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,020
Watch.

785
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:29,880
We're going to!

786
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,260
We're going to leave and we're going to find her impaled by something.

787
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,300
It's gonna happen.

788
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,640
We're gonna leave the temple and she will be...

789
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,280
dead, donezo, gone, gone, impaled by...

790
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,940
something, somewhere.

791
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:47,920
You know?

792
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,960
The lurkers rise up.

793
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:52,840
Lurkers!

794
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,490
Did I do that?

795
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:02,390
Oops.

796
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,290
Dummy Annika.

797
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,490
There it is.

798
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,150
Is that her?

799
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:15,930
Oh

800
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,020
my...

801
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,000
Damn!

802
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,760
Long live the king, Indiana Jones.

803
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:30,600
Wait.

804
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,440
Before I attempt that as well...

805
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,740
This is where I came from.

806
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,520
I'm trying to get my bearings.

807
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,880
A little bit.

808
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,140
Wait, that's not where I came from, is it?

809
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:52,960
Sorry.

810
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,020
I thought I just heard whispering.

811
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,160
It isn't.

812
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,820
Yeah, we came from a different pit.

813
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,780
Like over here, right?

814
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,940
Sorry, it's a little...

815
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,820
We came from here.

816
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,880
Way to manifest her demise.

817
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,160
What can I say?

818
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,140
Now we're all by ourselves and it's scary.

819
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,980
Okay, this is where we came from.

820
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,980
Okay, this is out of the door.

821
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,460
Look at this!

822
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,660
Actually, I'm such an idiot.

823
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,440
How did I not notice?

824
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,880
How did I not notice that this would have been...

825
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,900
Oopsie.

826
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,340
Donnie, welcome to membership!

827
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,360
Thank you!

828
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,220
Okay.

829
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,800
So she went this way.

830
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,720
We're following her steps.

831
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,500
Right before her death.

832
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,640
And then she went this way.

833
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,340
And then... squash!

834
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,440
But what's down here?

835
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,340
So, oh, this is obviously where we need to go since we...

836
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,940
Well, I'm assuming.

837
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,140
Well...

838
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,680
No, I do hear voices!

839
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,960
I do hear voices!

840
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,520
They thought it was a supernatural being!

841
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,780
You guys hear him too, right?

842
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,030
The voices, the voices.

843
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:56,830
I'm so close now.

844
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,470
Everyone who's underestimated me will see.

845
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:01,290
Yeah.

846
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,510
Oof.

847
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,350
So if I...

848
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,430
Donnie, thanks for the 10 gift, I appreciate it!

849
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,850
Bro, we're dealing with demons, right?

850
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,270
We have...

851
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,830
We have giants, we have demons, what else?

852
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,230
I don't want to open the door, I'm scared.

853
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:33,690
They all whistle.

854
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,810
That's how you know.

855
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,890
Let's open it.

856
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,860
It pulverized her into...

857
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,760
There's literally nothing but a hand.

858
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,100
Wait, if I go through that though, won't I also become literally just a hand?

859
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,980
Should we try it?

860
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,060
I think it saved.

861
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,860
Now I have to deal with bozos!

862
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,000
No, I just wanted to get out of here peacefully!

863
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,580
Oh man.

864
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,040
No.

865
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,560
Bless you.

866
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,180
It's Luigi's mansion.

867
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,880
What do I do?

868
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,960
Is that the exit right there?

869
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,920
Oh my god.

870
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,620
I checked out, buddy.

871
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,780
What about the other path?

872
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,200
You know what?

873
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,260
Yeah, let's go check that out.

874
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,040
I guess this is disarmed.

875
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,260
Time to rip those bozos.

876
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,680
RIP those bozos.

877
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,320
Watch, this probably just leads to a little...

878
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,840
Oh, I thought it was going to lead to a little...

879
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,140
Oh, what's this?

880
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,760
A little among us.

881
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,250
I see no trap.

882
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,130
Oh, but I see...

883
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:03,970
There... Wait.

884
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,350
No, this is where we came in.

885
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,350
This is where we were trapped before.

887
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,290
And then... But this is...

888
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,530
So it's just a...

889
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,930
It's just a big old circle?

890
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,330
We looped.

891
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,270
Oh, interesting.

892
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,050
What's this way though?

893
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,090
Oh, this is... Duh.

894
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,230
This is where I just came from.

895
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,410
The great circle.

896
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,410
So I do have to go to them.

897
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:50,770
Okay.

898
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:53,810
Stinky.

899
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,250
You think I could just make a run for it?

900
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,010
Gotta deal with the Mario brothers.

901
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:15,510
This is probably fine.

902
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,530
I remember how to fight and I remember how to block.

903
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:20,730
I think we're okay.

904
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,290
Can you loot her...

905
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,170
Keepsake?

906
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:25,330
Gosh.

907
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,790
Maybe I ate her.

908
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,830
That's so insane.

909
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,210
Excuse

910
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,610
you.

911
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,370
There's plenty of room.

912
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,870
You could've...

913
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,050
I'm waiting for him to go back to that door.

914
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,370
When they're both looking around.

915
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,570
Use the force.

916
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,510
The guys were saying they took her to a doctor.

917
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,010
Is that what they said?

918
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:15,250
Okay.

919
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:16,990
Alright.

920
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,630
Here I go.

921
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:19,950
I hope there's no one else.

922
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,190
Good, they're weak.

923
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,250
Peaceful.

924
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,110
God, scared me.

925
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,890
God, scared me.

926
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,690
How do I use this again?

927
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:49,970
Like so.

928
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:50,590
I remember.

929
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,070
Nice.

930
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,350
Alrighty.

931
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,290
Stealth optional.

932
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,070
So true.

933
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,750
And there should be no one else around, right?

934
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,070
Right.

935
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:11,170
This is the issue that I said was for future Indy.

936
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,990
How do we get out?

937
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:17,950
Oh, I hear whistling.

938
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,670
Shoot.

939
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,220
They didn't hear the gunshots?

940
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,500
Crazy.

941
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,870
I see no gamer tape.

942
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,430
Oh.

943
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,170
Oh my God.

944
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,110
All I did was jump.

945
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,910
It's your friends.

946
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,350
I can't get out.

947
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,390
Please.

948
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,230
Can you help me?

949
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,210
I'm stuck.

950
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,950
How do I get out?

951
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,570
Oh my God.

952
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,310
Oh shit.

953
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,120
What the hell?

954
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,960
Oh, they jumped in.

955
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,400
They jumped in.

956
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:18,920
They jumped in.

957
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,660
They jumped in.

958
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:22,980
I think.

959
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,940
I'm gonna whip them.

960
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,030
Do you think he's in here?

961
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,850
Maybe he'll show me how to get out.

962
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,930
Oh my God.

963
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:48,890
What?

964
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,130
That's how you got out?

965
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:51,890
He really did show me.

966
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,760
How did he do that?

967
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,490
How did he do that?

968
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,690
He's the best.

969
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,690
You need to buy air hike.

970
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,690
I hate this.

971
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,430
We're crossing the streams.

972
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:24,970
Ok, I'm gonna try.

973
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,610
Oh my God!

974
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,170
Run!

975
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,250
Gina, start the boat!

976
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,050
Gina, start the boat!

977
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:36,210
Gina, start the boat.

978
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:37,430
Gina!

979
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,890
Gina, you left me, you bitch!

980
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,800
They won't chase after me, right?

981
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,530
I'm safe.

982
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:08,670
Anyway...

983
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,850
Gina, I have a lot of words for you.

984
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,810
Betrayal after betrayal.

985
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,030
Why did she leave me?

986
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,710
Why did she leave me?

987
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:26,810
Gina!

988
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,110
Oh my God.

989
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,150
Well, we got out.

990
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,410
Easy peasy.

991
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:38,830
Mangosteen.

992
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:42,990
Mangosteen.

993
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,010
I've never tried that before.

994
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,630
Ok, where are we?

995
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,170
Ok, we have to go all the way...

996
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,290
A place where we can get a new boat.

997
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:03,470
Maybe.

998
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,750
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp.

999
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,910
It's gonna be a...

1000
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,470
A bit of a...

1001
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:23,190
If you consider lots of the appeal of Indy is him bumbling his way into and then through situations, then this is the perfect playthrough.

1002
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,290
That's what I'm saying!

1003
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:29,470
I literally did exactly what Indiana...

1004
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:31,910
Jones would've.

1005
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:33,690
Gina?

1006
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,950
What the hell are you doing all the way over here?

1007
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:39,490
Gina!

1008
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:41,470
Why

1009
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,350
are you at the treehouse?

1010
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:04,450
Oh my God.

1011
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,090
Why are you here?

1012
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,530
Gina, let me in.

1013
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,750
Gina, Gina, Gina, Gina.

1014
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:13,810
Oh God, I'm under the boat.

1015
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:16,490
Gina, let me up.

1016
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:19,470
Hello.

1017
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,030
Where have you been?

1018
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,390
She's not even talking to me.

1019
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,770
She's giving me the silent treatment.

1020
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:30,310
Come on, Gina.

1021
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:31,510
Let's go home.

1022
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,840
She won't talk to me.

1023
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,860
She has nothing to say.

1024
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,380
This is the first time I think I've ever heard her shut up.

1025
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,640
Quite honestly.

1026
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,460
Am I going the right way?

1027
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:48,680
Yep.

1028
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,820
She knows you cheated.

1029
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,740
I didn't cheat.

1030
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,060
Oh, okay.

1031
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,020
I can't pilot the boat and have the boat...

1032
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,600
Why is she looking at me like that?

1033
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,260
Like I did you wrong.

1034
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,300
I didn't do you dirty, girl.

1035
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,200
You left me.

1036
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:09,470
This way.

1037
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,250
I think she's supposed to be talking.

1038
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,650
Guys, we might have broken the game.

1039
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,290
This is the perfect bug.

1040
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:26,510
It gets Gina to shut up.

1041
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,390
Yeah.

1042
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:37,850
Nice.

1043
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:37,870
Nice.

1044
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:43,770
Triple A game.

1045
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,210
You like Gina?

1046
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,270
She's not bad.

1047
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,170
She could be worse.

1048
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,270
I kid, mostly.

1049
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,190
But it's fun to make fun of her.

1050
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,370
Gina really doesn't care about me, though.

1051
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,350
She really doesn't.

1052
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,870
Okay, right there.

1053
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:04,430
Gina?

1054
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:05,490
I think we're stuck.

1055
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,710
Oh.

1056
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,850
It actually won't let me... Wait, there we go.

1057
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:17,990
Hold on.

1058
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:21,730
Maybe if I go directly in?

1059
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,960
There we go.

1060
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,240
That was weird.

1061
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,020
Okay.

1062
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,300
And our little dock is right there.

1063
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,820
Maybe I was too close to a corner or something.

1064
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:43,940
Gina, you good?

1065
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,660
Let me try talking to her again.

1066
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,400
Gina, speak to me!

1067
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,740
I thought... Oh no!

1068
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,560
She's been impaled!

1069
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,440
Maybe Gina was never really real.

1070
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:08,430
Okay.

1071
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,710
Hello?

1072
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:12,910
Who am I talking to?

1073
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,130
Oh, okay.

1074
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:16,610
We did it.

1075
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,330
I found it.

1076
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,070
I found it.

1077
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:36,870
Oh.

1078
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:51,710
She's a venom, Annika.

1079
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,030
Okay, you're welcome!

1080
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:57,870
Alright.

1081
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:00,410
Yippee!

1082
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:03,010
Study and fear completed.

1083
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:08,010
Now we can move on to...

1084
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:09,970
The Blessed Pearl.

1085
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:11,810
Let's go.

1086
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,370
Let's leave this area.

1087
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,850
Gina!

1088
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:27,290
I haven't heard your voice in ages!

1089
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:28,890
Gina!

1090
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:32,730
Okay, secret armory...

1091
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,690
Not Tong Dan Cai.

1092
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,970
I don't remember which one is the closest.

1093
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,600
Maybe this one.

1094
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:48,080
I don't know.

1095
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,220
Punished Annika.

1096
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,940
A student deprived of her degree.

1097
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,220
Let's see this one.

1098
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,060
Where are we?

1099
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,920
We are... Oh!

1100
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,320
Not bad, actually.

1101
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,220
Wat Matat.

1102
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:12,560
Oh wait, maybe... I thought it was all the way up here in the corner.

1103
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,140
Nevermind, it's right here in the middle.

1104
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,140
Let's go to his hut.

1105
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:27,440
Okay.

1106
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:32,400
Okay.

1107
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:33,880
Let's go.

1108
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:54,430
Alright, right over here.

1109
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,810
Not very far at all, actually.

1110
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,770
Like, right here?

1111
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:07,450
So we dock here?

1112
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:09,970
I guess.

1113
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,210
Oh, right here!

1114
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:14,090
I guess we never docked here before.

1115
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,590
Okay.

1116
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,050
We made it!

1117
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,130
There's definitely monkeys in there.

1118
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:32,010
But this place, I remember it was crawling with guys.

1119
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:38,190
Yeah, you and me too, sister.

1120
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,590
I'm scared.

1121
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:51,730
I see one guy.

1122
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,530
I'm following you.

1123
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:57,470
I don't know, actually.

1124
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:00,370
What are we looking for, Gina?

1125
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,910
Do you want to give us some hints?

1126
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:05,550
You do?

1127
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:06,690
What?

1128
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:10,330
Gina!

1129
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,010
Gina!

1130
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:12,570
Look at you!

1131
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,450
Your special eyes.

1132
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:20,430
What is

1133
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,300
it?

1134
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,500
Regirock!

1135
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,180
Oh my god!

1136
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,420
Gina found it!

1137
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,000
For real, girl!

1138
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:43,720
Nevermind.

1139
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:43,860
Nevermind.

1140
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,460
The music.

1141
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,060
Better than Anima.

1142
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:57,820
So true!

1143
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,700
Gina, you get an A plus in my class.

1144
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,000
Seymour, thanks for the gift!

1145
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,440
Oh my gosh, not so loud, please!

1146
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,840
I actually had some Regirock TikToks that I was going to show.

1147
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,300
Oh!

1148
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,000
Gina!

1149
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,520
Ok, bye.

1150
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,160
Secret entrance.

1151
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,260
Ok, let's go.

1152
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,440
Gina is ready to rock and roll.

1153
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,600
Regirock and roll.

1154
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:31,340
It does!

1155
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,820
What are you trying to say, huh, Gina?

1156
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,540
Oh, where was I looking?

1157
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:42,700
Maybe we gotta kiss in front of this thing to activate it.

1158
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,760
Is this a...

1159
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,780
I thought it would be a timed...

1160
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,780
Like a quick timed event.

1161
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,460
Alright, Gina, what are you doing?

1162
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,540
Do we have...

1163
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,540
Do we have any of those?

1164
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:14,220
A torch?

1165
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,480
Do we have that?

1166
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:22,920
A torch?

1167
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,580
A torch.

1168
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,900
Does she want my...

1169
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,520
My lighter?

1170
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,880
Gina, there's like... It's really wet down here.

1171
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,520
I don't think even a torch would work.

1172
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:48,420
I'll be honest, I saw this earlier and I thought they were like a little...

1173
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,440
Hold on.

1174
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:09,850
I was saying I thought they were like the little things you blow like poison darts through, you know?

1175
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,570
Yeah, we almost killed her.

1176
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:21,230
That's ok though.

1177
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:23,550
How do you know?

1178
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:24,630
What about the kissing?

1179
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,430
What's that noise?

1180
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:34,730
Uh oh.

1181
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,330
Ok.

1182
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,150
Gina!

1183
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:41,670
Gina!

1184
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:44,750
Ok.

1185
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:47,290
Let's check it out.

1186
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,010
Yummy!

1187
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:51,570
Thanks for 8 months.

1188
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,870
If Gina won't kiss Indy, I will.

1189
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,480
Alright, do it.

1190
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:04,540
You're right.

1191
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,060
This pre-dates the rise of Tsukutai.

1192
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,060
People who lived here would have built their temple on top of this.

1193
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,440
Concealing it for generations.

1194
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,440
Tsukutai...

1195
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:21,220
Maybe we could...

1196
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:21,920
Where are you going?

1197
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,680
Jones, it's the game.

1198
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,030
But just big.

1199
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:38,230
Squid...I've played these games before!

1200
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:43,430
I said I've played these games before!

1201
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,270
What's wrong?

1202
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:56,870
I literally played this game.

1203
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,170
The blessed pearl.

1204
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:06,890
We have to go together.

1205
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,090
But...

1206
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,170
I don't want to kill you.

1207
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,230
Ok.

1208
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:41,450
She's speaking Indy language.

1209
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,970
Yeah, the actual language is Thai.

1210
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:48,390
Oh, that's not a camera.

1211
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,050
That's not a camera either.

1212
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:52,810
There we go.

1213
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,230
Alright, game room.

1214
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:57,550
I've played these games before!

1215
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:02,250
Has this actually turned into a squid game?

1216
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,330
Look, everybody's here.

1217
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:04,990
Oh my god.

1218
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:06,730
What should I do?

1219
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:17,890
I don't remember how I played this before.

1220
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,590
Oh, that's right.

1221
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:20,990
That's right.

1222
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:22,310
Hold on.

1223
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:23,870
Oh god, it's really sensitive.

1224
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,630
We have to get them all to face the same way.

1225
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:33,230
I'm assuming they all have to face...

1226
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,750
This way, right?

1227
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,070
I don't know what I...

1228
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,290
They all have to face this way.

1229
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:47,530
I'm assuming.

1230
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:49,830
Raiders.

1231
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:52,350
Sorry, channel.

1232
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,550
Thanks for the raid.

1233
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:57,290
Gosh, this thing is sensitive.

1234
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:00,310
Ok, that makes it face that way.

1235
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,430
Unless they all need to face this way.

1236
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:07,290
I'm not sure.

1237
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:08,530
Where are we?

1238
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:09,270
Thanks for the 5k.

1239
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,450
Someone stand here.

1240
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:36,210
How do I tell them to stand there?

1241
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,830
Oh, she's doing it.

1242
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:42,310
She's doing it.

1243
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:44,770
Ok, nice and slow though.

1244
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:49,010
What if I do this?

1245
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,210
See, see, see.

1246
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:56,010
So now, we need someone to stand here.

1247
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,090
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

1248
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:02,870
Hey, someone.

1249
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:03,870
You.

1250
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:06,450
Yeah, help.

1251
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:07,610
Stand here.

1252
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:15,150
Like that?

1253
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,470
Ok, ok, ok.

1254
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:19,710
Wait.

1255
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:24,010
Oh, but this will change it.

1256
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:25,430
Ok.

1257
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:31,690
Maybe here.

1258
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:35,850
This one, this one, this one, this one.

1259
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:42,050
Try that.

1260
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:45,410
Gosh, this is going to be a process now, isn't it?

1261
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:49,290
Ok, come here.

1262
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:52,870
Come here, come here and you go here.

1263
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,410
And then if I stand on it too...

1264
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:14,660
Thanks.

1265
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:19,080
Are you going to come with or are you just going to...

1266
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,000
Are you just going to chill here?

1267
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,780
With your feet in the...

1268
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,720
I'm right here.

1269
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,420
You don't have to yell.

1270
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:31,900
I don't think he can move.

1271
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,380
He's stuck in the rock.

1272
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,600
He's a little stuck.

1273
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:41,140
Lost temple.

1274
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,200
Well, I...

1275
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,120
I wasn't until you've mentioned it.

1276
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,040
Well,

1277
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,800
we actually have to do that.

1278
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:05,200
There is a...

1279
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,960
There is no other way in.

1280
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,000
This is kind of creepy.

1281
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,240
Anyone else want to jump in?

1282
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:14,940
Please.

1283
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,820
Are you ok down there?

1284
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:18,000
No.

1285
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:19,840
I'm scared.

1286
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,660
What is that?

1287
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,500
Do you think they are alive?

1288
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,300
Messenger statue?

1289
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,320
Oh my god.

1290
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,320
I'm trying to...

1291
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,240
I want to get in the middle there.

1292
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:39,670
Come on in.

1293
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:50,290
Not jump.

1294
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,210
I'm not happy.

1295
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:53,610
They are like...

1296
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:56,390
Ten doll.

1297
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,470
You too.

1298
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,270
No wonder the giants died out.

1299
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,410
Statue.

1300
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:14,450
Another photo?

1301
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,510
Statue symbol.

1302
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:23,610
Nothing to say about that though.

1303
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:24,630
Oh, we are still going.

1304
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:27,590
I have a feeling I'm about to fight another guy.

1305
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,250
Like another big man.

1306
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,910
Why can't I just live a peaceful archeologist life?

1307
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,090
Here we go.

1308
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,660
That doesn't look good.

1309
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,060
Is that a snake or...

1310
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,520
What?

1311
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,980
What the hell?

1312
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:15,730
Trying to see it.

1313
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,390
I think I parkoured over here.

1314
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:21,090
What?

1315
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:22,370
Leeches?

1316
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:25,330
Why are they all concentrated in one area?

1317
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,210
They are like the most...

1318
01:20:28,210 --> 01:20:31,670
They are fish that have not been fed in the longest time ever.

1319
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:37,360
Where are they?

1320
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,420
What the hell is this?

1321
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,260
It's a little sensitive.

1322
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,780
There we go.

1323
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,380
They are following me.

1324
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,480
It's so nasty.

1325
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,280
And...

1326
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,060
Nice.

1327
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,200
Oh god, here they come.

1328
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:19,400
And then I...

1329
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,200
Good question.

1330
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:20,860
Oh, there.

1331
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:30,050
Everyone else would have definitely gotten in my way, huh?

1332
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:33,610
I guess we are going this...

1333
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:36,030
Wait, there are so many different directions I could go.

1334
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:38,270
And what's up with these holes?

1335
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:40,570
There are some on this side too.

1336
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:49,050
I'm assuming piranhas, maybe.

1337
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:52,710
Oh, hi Minty Minto.

1338
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:54,690
Hope you are doing well today.

1339
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,390
Hello.

1340
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:58,150
Eric.

1341
01:21:58,150 --> 01:21:59,130
One Eric.

1342
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:00,730
W1.

1343
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:04,610
I hope you are doing well.

1344
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:06,790
W2.

1345
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:09,790
W1.

1346
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:11,790
Get it?

1347
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:18,370
What's happening?

1348
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,670
I think they followed me over here.

1349
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,190
But what's over there?

1350
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:27,890
Hold on, there might be a little among us over that way.

1351
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:29,990
It's my birthday.

1352
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:30,510
Here is your card.

1353
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,830
Turbulence, happy birthday.

1354
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:37,370
Happy birthday to you.

1355
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:40,370
Happy birthday to you.

1356
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:44,570
Happy birthday dear Turbulence.

1357
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:48,190
Happy birthday to you.

1358
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,910
Happy birthday.

1359
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,290
Let's watch out for these guys.

1360
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,130
I knew it.

1361
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:03,650
Among us.

1362
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:08,830
And back.

1363
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:15,230
At least this one was pretty harmless to grab, I suppose.

1364
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:19,990
Yeah, Indy does seem a little quiet now, doesn't he?

1365
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:21,790
Oh good, it just saved.

1366
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:22,610
That's kind of nice.

1367
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,690
Indy has not been speaking much at all, has he?

1368
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:29,210
I hope my game isn't bugged for real.

1369
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,550
I think I need to jump.

1370
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,830
No I don't.

1371
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,190
Troy needed a break.

1372
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,870
He's got no one to talk to.

1373
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:47,490
Oh my god, I didn't think I was going to make that for a second.

1374
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:47,610
I did it.

1375
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:02,500
Alright, Indiana Jones on her way down.

1376
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,240
Let's go.

1377
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,100
This doesn't seem very safe.

1378
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,020
Oh my god, there we go.

1379
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:15,840
Hoi!

1380
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:22,700
Took it a little far there, Indy.

1381
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:23,960
I think.

1382
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,040
We are almost to the bottom.

1383
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,360
If we fell...

1384
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,160
I think...

1385
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,400
Ouch, we make it.

1386
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,340
Why did I get injured?

1387
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:44,990
What was that?

1388
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,390
Anyway.

1389
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:52,950
Hopefully no more giant snakes.

1390
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,120
Where are we now?

1391
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,140
Intersectuary.

1392
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,080
Indy, you have nothing to say about this?

1393
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,740
Hi, I'm Indiana Jones.

1394
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,300
I'm going to be...

1395
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,260
Why do I sound like...

1396
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,920
Not Zelda, Elvis.

1397
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,840
This looks like a trap.

1398
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,140
That's the pearl?

1399
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,780
Doesn't look like a pearl to me.

1400
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,600
Maybe the game got bugged?

1401
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,380
I think so.

1402
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:47,210
Why does he look like...

1403
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,950
What is this sussy ass face?

1404
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:52,150
I gotta be a what?

1405
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:57,270
It's all good now.

1406
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:00,950
I think it resets after the cutscene.

1407
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:05,230
But if it keeps bugging out, then I will save or quit and reset.

1408
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:13,920
Uh oh.

1409
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,940
Metatron!

1410
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,060
It's the circle!

1411
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:36,840
It's the circle!

1412
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,140
Megatron, rise up!

1413
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:42,780
To what?

1414
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,420
No one is telling us anything.

1415
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,480
The great circle!

1416
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:03,590
They did say don't speak his name, right?

1417
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:10,630
I'm Minto.

1418
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,930
Say my name.

1419
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:22,230
That sounds like a door shutting.

1420
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,570
Yeah, you too.

1421
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:37,830
I think I'm a little tired of this.

1422
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,730
I got it!

1423
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:43,390
Oh OK.

1424
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,740
Why was I getting hurt?

1425
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,300
I don't know.

1426
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:53,360
Why am I almost dead?

1427
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,060
The leeches?

1428
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,020
No way.

1429
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,400
The pain is really coming in clutch right now.

1430
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:20,080
Nice and easy.

1431
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,520
Don't, don't.

1432
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,540
Take your time indeed.

1433
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,280
No rush for real.

1434
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,140
Don't worry about it.

1435
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:30,980
Just keep going.

1436
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:32,660
OK.

1437
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,420
Up.

1438
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:34,240
Lift.

1439
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:35,860
And right.

1440
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:41,230
This way instead.

1441
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:45,430
Shoot.

1442
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:48,650
Oh my gosh.

1443
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:56,890
Oh my god, gamer pain really coming in clutch right now.

1444
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:03,050
Yep, yep, yep.

1445
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:06,450
And let's crawl on through there.

1446
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:08,370
I don't think we need that.

1447
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:11,690
Put that away.

1448
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:16,990
I'm just gonna guess this is where I need to go.

1449
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:18,970
Oh my god, oh my god.

1450
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,170
Oh my god, no, no, don't distract me.

1451
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,770
Oh gosh, where, where?

1452
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:25,450
Doko, doko, doko, doko.

1453
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:30,510
I don't know.

1454
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:33,690
Wait, I actually don't know.

1455
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:37,990
I think we...

1456
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:45,670
Too early, sorry.

1457
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:48,750
And...

1458
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,100
Bye Scaries!

1459
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,240
Bye bye!

1460
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:09,360
Oh what?

1461
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,180
What did you bring me?

1462
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,240
What did you give me?

1463
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,480
I'm trying!

1464
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:16,880
I'm trying!

1465
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,480
What

1466
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:29,010
did she bring me?

1467
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:31,390
I don't even know actually.

1468
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:35,590
Oh my god.

1469
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:41,980
Up or down?

1470
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:43,940
Up maybe?

1471
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,780
Up seems like a good idea.

1472
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:52,200
Up seems like an optimal way to leave.

1473
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:53,420
Up.

1474
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,120
I could have gone through there maybe.

1475
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,700
I guess not.

1476
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:57,120
Through here?

1477
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:59,020
This is where we came from, right?

1478
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,960
Ok, here I go!

1479
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,660
Up the boob, yeah.

1480
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:07,700
We are just about out.

1481
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,500
That is Gina, right?

1482
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,860
What do you mean?

1483
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:30,360
Why did you give it straight to her?

1484
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,180
Come on!

1485
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,100
Better him than boss maybe.

1486
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,060
Why did you give it straight to Gina?

1487
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:24,120
That guy's eyes were bugging me.

1488
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,680
I see you found the stone for me.

1489
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:36,500
Is that the stone for Machu Picchu?

1490
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:42,700
You know, I had a feeling that Gan's force, that little sausage would die for his fatherland.

1491
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,560
I hate that!

1492
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,680
But tell me!

1493
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,440
Did you and your sister...

1494
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,940
Have a sweet reunion in the Malayas?

1495
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:53,820
Go to hell, boss!

1496
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,340
No, she didn't make it.

1497
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:00,440
What a shame.

1498
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,660
She didn't make it!

1499
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:09,420
Giant!

1500
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,250
Even though you are kind of a bad guy...

1501
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:21,050
Why did you drop it in the middle of the walkway?

1502
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:22,750
Are you kidding me?

1503
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:28,270
It's a little shimmy, I know.

1504
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:32,230
What are you doing?

1505
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:35,450
What are you doing?

1506
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:38,150
Oh, damn!

1507
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:45,550
Protection!

1508
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:47,450
Thank you!

1509
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:54,810
Yeah, OK, let's go.

1510
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:56,350
Shoot, I'm trying to get out.

1511
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:00,750
Yeah, good job, Gan.

1512
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:02,070
Maybe put it up, OK.

1513
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:04,350
You could have literally...

1514
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:06,970
No, don't open it for them!

1515
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,150
OK, that's good.

1516
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,350
There you go.

1517
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:18,710
Take cover!

1518
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,010
Oh my God!

1519
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,810
Giant stumbled like me on my way to the prison midnight.

1520
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:33,610
Friendly fire!

1521
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:39,250
Friendly fire!

1522
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:40,650
Get their weapons.

1523
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:46,070
Oh my God!

1524
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:48,070
When do they run out of bullets?

1525
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:54,870
Yeah!

1526
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:02,240
Oh my God, finally we have a backup.

1527
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,700
Finally!

1528
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,600
He's with us!

1529
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,420
Thanks!

1530
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:12,180
Bye!

1531
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,180
I'm going!

1532
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:16,360
I'm going!

1533
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,600
Don't die!

1534
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,640
Don't die!

1535
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:20,640
I'm match lady!

1536
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:24,620
I'm Itoko Morning!

1537
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,350
That applies to you too!

1538
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:41,750
Big giant man!

1539
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:43,610
Hold on!

1540
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:48,150
Oh my God, fruit basket.

1541
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:50,350
Why did you help us?

1542
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:52,290
I choose the lesser evil.

1543
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:54,090
Oh shoot, actually...

1544
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:59,430
The enemy of your enemy, huh?

1545
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:02,190
The stones cannot be used by that creature.

1546
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,150
Oh my God, there they are.

1547
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:05,650
Ah!

1548
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:12,750
I tried.

1549
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,510
Hold on.

1550
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:21,270
My aim is happening.

1551
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,630
My aim is happening.

1552
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:24,430
How do I reload this thing?

1553
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,150
Geno, you're driving!

1554
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:37,350
I'm

1555
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:06,570
almost out of bullets.

1556
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:10,170
Oh my God!

1557
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:13,390
What do you mean firing positions?

1558
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:14,310
Where are they?

1559
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:15,390
There they are.

1560
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:19,190
Geno?

1561
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:27,820
I think we did

1562
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:37,860
it.

1563
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:40,820
Action!

1564
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:47,440
Is everybody else safe?

1565
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,460
Oh no.

1566
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:53,860
That doesn't look safe.

1567
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,460
Geno has been captured.

1568
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,660
All that to get captured?

1569
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:00,800
What the hell?

1570
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,300
Oh no!

1571
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:06,780
No!

1572
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,160
Who's that?

1573
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,860
Is that Giant Man?

1574
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,100
Oh no, it's the baddies.

1575
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:40,820
No!

1576
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:47,900
Her...he...it was her...

1577
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:51,380
It was because of the research.

1578
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:52,920
You know, not...

1579
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,980
Spit on him!

1580
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:02,100
I think if you spat on him, he would like lick it up like a lizard.

1581
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:03,260
Oh damn!

1582
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:05,020
Ah!

1583
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:07,540
There it is!

1584
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:19,550
What if all I had to do to bend her will was to threaten something of great value to her?

1585
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:20,750
Like family.

1586
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:29,350
This is so crazy!

1587
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,260
Watch out Indy!

1588
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:47,960
Watch out!

1589
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:50,560
How can he hold on?

1590
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,440
Indy's got such solid grip.

1591
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,480
What do you...

1592
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,000
What do you want me to do?

1593
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:02,760
I guess follow them?

1594
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,380
Is there a weapon?

1595
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,380
Oh my god, there's so many guys.

1596
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:25,130
How do you see me?

1597
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:27,270
Oh, nice.

1598
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,900
How does he see me?

1599
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,720
How does he see me?

1600
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,460
Oh god.

1601
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,360
Yeah, that's right.

1602
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,200
Take his gun.

1603
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:54,480
Damn.

1604
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:55,880
What the fuck?

1605
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,360
How are you still alive?

1606
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:04,930
How is he still alive?

1607
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:06,410
No!

1608
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:08,330
No!

1609
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:11,330
I can't believe that just happened!

1610
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:13,810
Lucky hat!

1611
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:15,510
It's my hat!

1612
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:17,130
Oh damn!

1613
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:18,070
Oh my god!

1614
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:22,550
What?

1615
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:34,890
Maybe stealth is the way here.

1616
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:35,990
If I can.

1617
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:37,930
They notice me so easily.

1618
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:47,770
Oh my gosh.

1619
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:48,670
How?

1620
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:48,970
No!

1621
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:50,150
You don't notice me!

1622
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:51,650
You do not notice me!

1623
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,730
That's so unfair.

1624
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:53,670
I'm just gonna keep crawling.

1625
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:57,610
No.

1626
01:41:58,050 --> 01:41:58,710
Is that it?

1627
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:00,030
French?

1628
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:03,390
Holy blue.

1629
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:06,390
Yeah, probably nothing.

1630
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:07,110
Exactly.

1631
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:09,090
Exactly.

1632
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:13,230
Yeah, guns must be super weak in this or something, because what the hell?

1633
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:16,650
I wish this guy would... Oh no, no, no.

1634
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:18,850
No, please.

1635
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:19,790
Leave me alone.

1636
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:22,690
Just the wind.

1637
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:25,350
Is he coming this way?

1638
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:26,170
Oh my god.

1639
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:29,230
Everybody sees me out of their peripherals like crazy.

1640
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:34,150
Oh my god.

1641
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:36,810
Please, leave me alone.

1642
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:40,130
I can't tell if they are coming this way or not.

1643
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:51,420
Nice.

1644
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:58,100
Oh shit.

1645
01:43:02,490 --> 01:43:03,990
Is there anyone else?

1646
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:06,030
I wish I could take their uniform.

1647
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:09,980
Let's go.

1648
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:10,180
What?

1649
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:15,530
What do you mean he got away?

1650
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:17,270
Who?

1651
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:19,230
Wait, they saw me?

1652
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:20,450
Who saw me?

1653
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:24,070
Okay.

1654
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:30,410
Hop.

1655
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:33,830
Hop.

1656
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:35,570
Hop.

1657
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:37,790
Okay.

1658
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:39,130
We continue.

1659
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:40,110
I'm going.

1660
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:41,270
Oh, okay.

1661
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:42,730
Indy, shh, shh, shh.

1662
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:45,230
Okay, I'm in the cave.

1663
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:46,970
Why am I in here?

1664
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:49,990
What was close?

1665
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,450
Oh.

1666
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:52,270
Gina!

1667
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:54,210
Gina, I'm coming!

1668
01:43:58,110 --> 01:43:58,510
Gina?

1669
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:01,730
Oh, Gina?

1670
01:44:02,290 --> 01:44:03,610
Did they like record her voice?

1671
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:11,050
This is not real Gina!

1672
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:12,830
This is not real Gina!

1673
01:44:12,930 --> 01:44:13,490
This is fake!

1674
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:16,070
Or...

1675
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:18,790
It's fake Gina.

1676
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:20,190
I got an achievement.

1677
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:21,990
The Blessed Pearl.

1678
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:24,390
Oh, you!

1679
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:25,410
Hello.

1680
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:28,810
Indy, your survival instincts.

1681
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:31,250
I don't know.

1682
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:41,660
The fake Gina.

1683
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:44,360
Wait, a bug?

1684
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,420
She repeats this line for the whole game now?

1685
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:47,360
No way.

1686
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,460
How much left of the game is there?

1687
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:56,560
Look at him, he's so small.

1688
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,540
Small Indiana Jones.

1689
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:03,840
Little baby.

1690
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:08,220
Just like a heavy rain.

1691
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:11,020
Yeah!

1692
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,600
We're leaving!

1693
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,120
We can accomplish that area.

1694
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:17,880
Let's go!

1695
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:32,170
Maybe he will be more used than Gina.

1696
01:45:33,670 --> 01:45:35,110
Yeah, where are we going?

1697
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:36,790
Oh, my hat!

1698
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:40,730
We're just, you know, in the desert.

1699
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:49,170
No more boats.

1700
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,130
Oh, damn.

1701
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:53,830
Okay.

1702
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:56,630
Having a giant is really helpful.

1703
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:25,650
Or...

1704
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:28,450
Oh my god!

1705
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:35,670
I love having a giant!

1706
01:46:44,430 --> 01:46:45,690
It's true.

1707
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:49,410
It's okay if he's dead.

1708
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,770
He should have taken his clothes.

1709
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:56,570
I've killed many people.

1710
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:58,910
With my fists too.

1711
01:46:59,310 --> 01:46:59,850
Probably.

1712
01:47:00,290 --> 01:47:01,250
5'11 vs.

1713
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:02,030
6''.

1714
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:02,910
It's true.

1715
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:16,870
You know she's here?

1716
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:25,170
We know nothing.

1717
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,710
He's not gonna tell us?

1718
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:34,970
Oh my god!

1719
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:49,250
Angry German.

1720
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:53,350
When you finally open the window...

1721
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:56,490
Oh, you're not doing... You're fine.

1722
01:47:58,170 --> 01:47:59,150
It's fine.

1723
01:47:59,290 --> 01:48:00,330
Don't worry about it.

1724
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:03,070
Does he see that guy's head?

1725
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:04,890
Does he see that guy's head?

1726
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:06,790
It's just a rock!

1727
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:10,930
Yeah, it's just a really round rock.

1728
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:11,470
Shiny.

1729
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:13,350
Bald.

1730
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:15,170
Glistening in the moonlight.

1731
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:21,170
He's Snow White?

1732
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:23,490
The birds!

1733
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:25,770
What?

1734
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:35,530
What?

1735
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:41,570
Army of giants?

1736
01:48:50,110 --> 01:48:50,950
Giants?

1737
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:56,050
I think I would probably do that, Indiana Jones.

1738
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:08,850
I think supernatural happenings are about to start happening.

1739
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:10,450
I think...

1740
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:17,130
I think supernatural happenings are about to start happening.

1741
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:21,830
Oh, nice.

1742
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:32,510
Oh, they're gonna do it for us.

1743
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:34,270
Yeah, get rid of the guards!

1744
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:37,870
Oh my god, what a starry night.

1745
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:38,710
Beautiful.

1746
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:44,430
Oh my god!

1747
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:48,850
Release the giants!

1748
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,350
Okay, cool.

1749
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,550
I'm going too.

1750
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:00,750
Here we go.

1751
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:03,950
Get my friend?

1752
01:50:04,410 --> 01:50:04,670
Wait.

1753
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:07,810
Wait, where is she?

1754
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:08,770
Where is my friend?

1755
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:09,790
Gina?

1756
01:50:11,450 --> 01:50:12,830
Who scribbled this?

1757
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:14,210
Indiana Jones!

1758
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:16,030
Come on man.

1759
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:20,890
Wait, you were supposed to take out all the guards!

1760
01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:24,130
I think you missed a couple.

1761
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,270
What's down here?

1762
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,770
Let's try...can I go down here?

1763
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:34,870
What?

1764
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:38,390
I'm just...I don't know where the hell I am now.

1765
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:41,790
What happened?

1766
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:43,130
What?

1767
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:56,720
They don't want you...Why would they let you...

1768
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:00,360
They don't want you going that way apparently.

1769
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,980
But it's just the excavation site!

1770
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:08,960
Oopsie.

1771
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:19,830
Anything inside here?

1772
01:51:21,870 --> 01:51:24,510
Oh, is this some bullets?

1773
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:28,090
And my health is full.

1774
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:31,270
So I guess we don't really need that.

1775
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:37,230
Boss's behavior was the German dub voice of Sam from Death Stranding?

1776
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:37,910
No way!

1777
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:40,390
Oh, a broom.

1778
01:51:41,550 --> 01:51:43,790
I'm gonna sweep away the baddies.

1779
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:44,630
Okay,

1780
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:49,510
how do I get in?

1781
01:51:50,450 --> 01:51:53,170
How do I...do I open the door?

1782
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:55,350
Can I do that?

1783
01:51:56,170 --> 01:51:57,750
There's still a lot of guys.

1784
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:11,790
To the excavation site!

1785
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:15,510
Oh, I see what I'm supposed to do.

1786
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:18,270
Oh, they want you to jump.

1787
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:21,050
Oh my god, how did anybody survive this?

1788
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:24,730
My bad.

1789
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:26,770
Maybe I shouldn't have...

1790
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:36,010
Oh god.

1791
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:37,650
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1792
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:42,400
Why did the fall...

1793
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,140
Hold on.

1794
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:44,240
My hat.

1795
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:52,450
This is fine actually.

1796
01:52:52,730 --> 01:52:53,490
Maybe they'll leave.

1797
01:52:56,730 --> 01:52:57,990
We got a map.

1798
01:52:58,730 --> 01:52:59,530
I'll take that.

1799
01:53:01,870 --> 01:53:04,490
I thought you guys were all being taken out.

1800
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:06,170
What happened?

1801
01:53:07,090 --> 01:53:07,870
Oh, there's my thing.

1802
01:53:08,610 --> 01:53:09,810
Love the hat, Mintiana Jones.

1803
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:10,450
Thank you!

1804
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:15,130
Let's eat some fruit.

1805
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:18,550
Or, okay, we're just throwing that on the ground.

1806
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:19,070
That's fine.

1807
01:53:23,110 --> 01:53:24,090
Take the orange.

1808
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:25,330
Take the date.

1809
01:53:25,330 --> 01:53:25,670
What

1810
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,740
was that?

1811
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:32,180
A letter.

1812
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:34,800
Censored letter.

1813
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:39,080
My dearest Gerda, I miss you terribly and hope you are doing well.

1814
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,280
We are now stationed in... Censored.

1815
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,620
Work is hard but incredibly exciting.

1816
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:48,800
I'm not sure I'm supposed to write this, but yesterday... Oh man, spilling the tea.

1817
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:51,860
Yesterday I was with...

1818
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:58,320
Vos, when he found Censored.

1819
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,240
I even got a pat on the shoulder.

1820
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,820
That's how happy he was.

1821
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:04,220
I know you won't believe me.

1822
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:06,280
I didn't believe it myself at first.

1823
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,900
This is a discovery that will shake the world.

1824
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:13,920
Anyway, I can't wait to come home and take you out to a nice restaurant.

1825
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:16,480
Send your mother and father my sincerest greetings.

1826
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,160
Love, Alwin.

1827
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:21,540
Indeed.

1828
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:33,580
I'm being sneaky.

1829
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:37,700
Apparently not sneaky enough.

1830
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:44,870
Where is she again?

1831
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:47,310
Where am I?

1832
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:48,510
Oh, she's over there.

1833
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:51,490
Maybe we can go through here.

1834
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:56,170
Where are all the giants?

1835
01:54:57,110 --> 01:54:58,650
They were like...

1836
01:54:58,650 --> 01:54:59,570
Oh shit.

1837
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:05,910
They were like, we are going to take out the guards and then you can run.

1838
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:16,880
Hello?

1839
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:20,580
Nice.

1840
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,780
Anyway, bye.

1841
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:25,600
Wait, there was something shiny there.

1842
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:27,060
What's this?

1843
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:29,000
A comic book.

1844
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,180
I don't have time.

1845
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:30,860
I got to go.

1846
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:31,840
I got to go.

1847
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:32,520
What's that?

1848
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:33,840
A brush.

1849
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:35,420
It's all we got.

1850
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,700
It's all we got guys.

1851
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:38,960
An even smaller brush.

1852
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,400
Ok, just take the brush.

1853
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,380
Alright, where is she?

1854
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,260
She is...Oh, she's right there.

1855
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:48,560
We are so close.

1856
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,720
Scrub the baddies away.

1857
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,220
Exactly.

1858
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:01,880
How do I get inside?

1859
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:03,200
It's a great question.

1860
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,300
Oh my god, please, please.

1861
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:05,800
No, please, please, please.

1862
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:12,380
Hop, hop.

1863
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:14,260
Where are they going?

1864
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,260
Oh my god, no.

1865
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:20,840
Just run.

1866
01:56:32,230 --> 01:56:33,410
Please, go down.

1867
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:36,710
Storytrope key!

1868
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:43,570
Oh, shoot.

1869
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:44,770
Don't shoot, actually.

1870
01:56:45,230 --> 01:56:48,010
Like, don't shoot, but like, shoot me.

1871
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:49,290
I mean, no, don't shoot me.

1872
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:50,490
Like, dammit.

1873
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:51,330
That's what I'm trying to say.

1874
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:55,350
Don't like actually shoot me.

1875
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:00,650
I'm going to enjoy this.

1876
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:05,950
Where do I go, actually?

1877
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:13,150
But I'm right here!

1878
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:16,830
Please, gang!

1879
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:19,950
I've done the objective.

1880
01:57:20,990 --> 01:57:21,930
Oh, use a bandage?

1881
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:23,010
Good idea, thank you.

1882
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:32,590
Who made that sound?

1883
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:33,650
Oh my god, no.

1884
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:34,870
Sir, please.

1885
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:36,170
It was a...

1886
01:57:40,690 --> 01:57:41,230
Alright.

1887
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:43,910
I'm going to go use this door.

1888
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,390
That apparently...

1889
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:48,930
triggers something.

1890
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:57,390
Hey, Gina.

1891
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:58,210
You okay?

1892
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:03,030
Yeah.

1893
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:05,530
Yeah, hold on.

1894
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:06,330
I'm looting.

1895
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:08,150
I'm looting.

1896
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:08,950
I'm looting.

1897
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:10,250
Okay.

1898
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:12,610
They don't keep any...

1899
01:58:12,610 --> 01:58:14,450
It's a storage room and they don't have anything in here?

1900
01:58:18,710 --> 01:58:19,350
Okay.

1901
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:26,470
I don't know how we manage that everybody, but...

1902
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:30,550
Yeah, let's go.

1903
01:58:35,450 --> 01:58:36,090
Girl?

1904
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:39,890
Yeah.

1905
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:43,870
I think the giants are handling that.

1906
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:45,990
Right?

1907
01:58:47,010 --> 01:58:49,450
The giants are going to take care of that.

1908
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:51,610
They're going to take care of that, Gina.

1909
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:52,910
We don't have to do anything.

1910
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:04,100
Why does she have to tickle my curiosity like that?

1911
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:05,480
Please, madam.

1912
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:07,500
Please.

1913
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,520
Oh dammit.

1914
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:14,120
Now I want to leave.

1915
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,320
Indy!

1916
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,060
Yeah, she's arousing my curiosity.

1917
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:26,100
I don't know.

1918
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,420
That could mean...

1919
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,220
Are guys lost or...

1920
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:32,740
the others are dead?

1921
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,320
Why does that look like Revolver Ocelot?

1922
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:49,540
Okay.

1923
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:51,300
Where is he?

1924
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:51,700
Up there?

1925
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:52,660
Okay.

1926
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:54,460
I'm following you.

1927
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:55,640
Gina, where are you going?

1928
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:56,860
Okay, Gina.

1929
01:59:58,340 --> 01:59:58,980
Alright, Gina.

1930
01:59:59,300 --> 01:59:59,640
Thanks.

1931
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:02,240
I'll take that, yeah.

1932
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:03,020
Where are you going, girl?

1933
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:05,900
I thought we were going to go to where Vos is?

1934
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:08,820
So literally, just go up there.

1935
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,000
Okay, got it.

1936
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:13,980
We can totally do this.

1937
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:17,910
A gun.

1938
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:41,450
There's so many guys.

1939
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:47,950
There's so many guys, Gina.

1940
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:48,630
Don't get caught.

1941
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:49,830
Madam.

1942
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:52,370
Shoot.

1943
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:19,250
Oh.

1944
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:22,370
Yeah.

1945
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:23,450
Anyway.

1946
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:25,290
Nobody saw anything.

1947
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:29,530
Are they?

1948
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:30,570
Who?

1949
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:31,770
Oh, that person?

1950
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:32,690
Don't worry about them.

1951
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:36,350
Shut up, Gina.

1952
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:45,990
No, please.

1953
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:52,090
Yeah.

1954
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:53,750
Get him, Gina.

1955
02:02:03,910 --> 02:02:05,030
I'm trying to run.

1956
02:02:09,870 --> 02:02:10,350
Nice.

1957
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:12,250
Oh god, there's more.

1958
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:13,630
Oh my god, I'm so dead.

1959
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:16,110
I'm eating bullets.

1960
02:02:17,410 --> 02:02:18,450
I'm so dead.

1961
02:02:18,910 --> 02:02:20,250
Why are there three of you?

1962
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:21,230
Please go away.

1963
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:24,810
Gina, are you okay?

1964
02:02:24,810 --> 02:02:25,130
Oh.

1965
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:35,900
Oh man.

1966
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:38,500
Okay, maybe another strat.

1967
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,040
Yeah, go in here.

1968
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:45,820
Grab this.

1969
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:47,140
Yeah.

1970
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:48,620
And we'll go.

1971
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:52,900
But I like having my...

1972
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:53,420
No.

1973
02:02:55,980 --> 02:03:01,780
I like having the mallet at the beginning at least.

1974
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:07,820
Maybe we take out this person here first.

1975
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:16,470
Where are they?

1976
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:21,910
Oh, there they are.

1977
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:26,910
I think if I go around and I take them out...

1978
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:30,150
Then it could be okay.

1979
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:39,250
They noticed me too well.

1980
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:40,610
You know what I mean?

1981
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:44,710
Stop goofing around.

1982
02:03:45,850 --> 02:03:46,930
They noticed me.

1983
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:49,010
And then...

1984
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:50,730
I can't do like the sneak...

1985
02:03:52,450 --> 02:03:53,610
Hello.

1986
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:01,770
Yeah, Gina!

1987
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:02,610
Get his ass!

1988
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,350
I'm so dead.

1989
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:06,690
I'm so dead.

1990
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:11,790
Just die.

1991
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:12,530
Gina!

1992
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:13,670
Gina!

1993
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:15,590
Gina!

1994
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:17,590
Gina!

1995
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:19,590
Gina!

1996
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:21,970
Gina!

1997
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:24,370
Gina!

1998
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:33,290
Metal Gear Solid Addict.

1999
02:04:33,330 --> 02:04:34,270
By the way, hey, hey, hey!

2000
02:04:34,530 --> 02:04:41,070
I have always, 100% always been open about the fact that I hate stealth games, okay?

2001
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:44,930
Don't put the...Don't mix Metal Gear in here.

2002
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:46,990
I hate stealth.

2003
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:54,730
Oh, but she plays Metal Gear Solid.

2004
02:04:57,590 --> 02:04:59,950
I play poorly.

2005
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:10,090
Indiana Jones needs to think of the box.

2006
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,700
How do we...

2007
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:20,520
Maybe I go this way instead.

2008
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:33,860
Seems to be a better way around.

2009
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:35,960
Maybe.

2010
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:41,960
Yeah.

2011
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:44,280
Nice.

2012
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:45,620
Nice.

2013
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,240
Nice, nice.

2014
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:48,020
Okay.

2015
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:49,160
Okay.

2016
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:51,540
And this guy too.

2017
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,280
Let's take him out.

2018
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,200
Let's get him.

2019
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,580
Let's get his...

2020
02:05:57,100 --> 02:05:58,140
Let's get his ass.

2021
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:11,460
Why are you so flimsy?

2022
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:15,280
I did see back there was a...

2023
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:18,420
Was a...

2024
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:20,760
Stop wanting me to take a picture.

2025
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,260
There was a...

2026
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,180
What's it called?

2027
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:27,780
A shovel.

2028
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:32,300
I could try and grab it.

2029
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,980
Before anyone notices maybe.

2030
02:06:39,740 --> 02:06:40,340
Oh shoot.

2031
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,040
Nevermind, nevermind.

2032
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:43,700
I'm trying.

2033
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:47,280
Oh my god, that guy is about to see us.

2034
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:48,880
Okay, it's going down.

2035
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:49,400
Nice.

2036
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:50,380
Okay.

2037
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:54,160
Yeah, nothing to worry about.

2038
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:57,100
Nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about.

2039
02:06:57,940 --> 02:06:58,280
Okay.

2040
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:08,490
You can only melee with a gun once it's out of bullets.

2041
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:11,570
At least that has been my experience.

2042
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:13,750
So...

2043
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:16,650
She doesn't know you can melee with a gun only when it's out of bullets.

2044
02:07:26,350 --> 02:07:27,230
Not true?

2045
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:27,990
What?

2046
02:07:28,670 --> 02:07:29,170
Then why?

2047
02:07:29,490 --> 02:07:30,250
Oh my god.

2048
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:32,390
Where is his gun?

2049
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:34,930
What do you press?

2050
02:07:35,090 --> 02:07:35,870
You can swap it?

2051
02:07:35,870 --> 02:07:37,710
Okay, now that I didn't know.

2052
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:39,990
Let's see.

2053
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:40,590
Carry.

2054
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:41,830
How do I swap?

2055
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:42,830
With X?

2056
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:45,350
Oh my god.

2057
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:46,330
Huge!

2058
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:48,490
Now that I didn't know.

2059
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:56,820
Bless you.

2060
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:08,460
Why are you one hit?

2061
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:11,120
Why is that one hit usually?

2062
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:11,220
Really?

2063
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:14,080
If I X?

2064
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:16,500
They do?

2065
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:17,920
Oh my god, where?

2066
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,160
When?

2067
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:20,560
Where?

2068
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:22,180
Where do they see me?

2069
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:25,580
Yeah, they're everywhere Gina.

2070
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:26,500
God damn it.

2071
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:35,650
Okay, this is the one.

2072
02:08:35,790 --> 02:08:36,250
Alright, alright.

2073
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:40,710
Oh my god!

2074
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:49,230
Okay, we got him.

2075
02:08:49,590 --> 02:08:50,130
Very good.

2076
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:53,630
Okay, stronger one.

2077
02:08:54,630 --> 02:08:54,930
Alright.

2078
02:08:56,350 --> 02:08:57,850
So far, not so bad.

2079
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:06,620
I wish it would save though, because that would be really dandy.

2080
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,000
Okay.

2081
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:13,300
Surprise.

2082
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:13,560
Surprise.

2083
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:17,080
Take that.

2084
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:17,580
What's this?

2085
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:20,440
Excavation plans.

2086
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:20,720
Okay.

2087
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:25,880
Take that.

2088
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:30,040
No, switch.

2089
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:31,140
Fuel.

2090
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:32,560
Okay, there we go.

2091
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:40,000
And the reason I'm switching is because I'm blocking it, but the weapons are about to break.

2092
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,840
So that's why I'm like going through and switching, but you can't really see because I'm blocking it.

2093
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:46,500
How do I get up there?

2094
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:50,740
Gina, girl.

2095
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:54,700
The durability.

2096
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,020
Maybe up here?

2097
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:00,260
This way?

2098
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:01,880
No?

2099
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:05,720
Am I not in a good place?

2100
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:06,280
No.

2101
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:08,400
I can't see anything.

2102
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:09,760
This thing is so huge.

2103
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:11,600
Did

2104
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:19,250
I go to the wrong place?

2105
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:31,000
God, I wish it would save.

2106
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:33,400
I don't want to have to do all of this over again.

2107
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:42,790
Madam?

2108
02:10:46,690 --> 02:10:47,550
Where are you going?

2109
02:10:49,230 --> 02:10:50,810
I don't know where to go.

2110
02:10:51,370 --> 02:10:52,530
I don't know where to go.

2111
02:10:52,530 --> 02:10:54,330
Can you save automatically?

2112
02:10:54,610 --> 02:10:55,190
I'm not sure.

2113
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:55,850
Let's see.

2114
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:57,870
Nope.

2115
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:04,190
Up the stairs?

2116
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:06,390
Stairs.

2117
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:09,490
This way?

2118
02:11:10,330 --> 02:11:11,330
Are there stairs over here?

2119
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:17,090
What do you think of weapons durability mechanics?

2120
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:18,770
Oh my god, there's a guy there.

2121
02:11:20,230 --> 02:11:21,190
They're fine.

2122
02:11:21,190 --> 02:11:21,290
Again?

2123
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:31,190
I think some things... I don't like how these are... If you do the sneak attack, it's...

2124
02:11:33,850 --> 02:11:35,250
It's like two hits.

2125
02:11:36,490 --> 02:11:38,330
But it is what it is.

2126
02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:40,610
I am lost.

2127
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:49,730
The farm is on the left side.

2128
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:52,490
Which left?

2129
02:11:54,570 --> 02:11:55,150
I'm so lost.

2130
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:03,440
Also, how did we get seen from over here?

2131
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:04,000
I don't know.

2132
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:10,980
So we have to go all the way actually to the other side.

2133
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:14,920
Okay, we go over here.

2134
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:17,580
Where all the bright lights and people are.

2135
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:18,560
That's really great.

2136
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:19,340
I love that.

2137
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:21,140
I love that.

2138
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:21,880
That's so awesome.

2139
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:24,280
That's so great.

2140
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:25,580
That's just so awesome.

2141
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,700
Oh my god.

2142
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:28,580
No, you didn't.

2143
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:32,200
I wish I could bait him over here.

2144
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:33,420
Oh, wait, he's coming.

2145
02:12:36,820 --> 02:12:37,260
I think.

2146
02:12:40,370 --> 02:12:42,310
I had no idea how to use the repair kits.

2147
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:43,090
Is that for the weapons?

2148
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:45,890
I guess that makes sense.

2149
02:12:46,270 --> 02:12:47,150
I have some.

2150
02:12:48,490 --> 02:12:53,590
Okay, I think I'm just gonna have to do it.

2151
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:55,510
I don't know.

2152
02:12:57,730 --> 02:12:58,790
Oh shit.

2153
02:13:00,490 --> 02:13:01,490
Oh shit.

2154
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:02,790
Oh shit.

2155
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:03,330
No!

2156
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:04,170
Oh shit.

2157
02:13:04,690 --> 02:13:05,510
You bastard!

2158
02:13:05,690 --> 02:13:06,410
You bitch!

2159
02:13:06,730 --> 02:13:07,310
Fuck you!

2160
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:08,550
You suck!

2161
02:13:08,830 --> 02:13:10,150
You fucking bitch!

2162
02:13:10,570 --> 02:13:11,250
This

2163
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:20,330
is not a smirking moment!

2164
02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:21,610
Indiana Jones!

2165
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:25,610
Oh my god.

2166
02:13:27,130 --> 02:13:28,250
Gina!

2167
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:29,170
Gina?

2168
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:30,170
Maybe?

2169
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:30,770
Gina?

2170
02:13:32,810 --> 02:13:33,930
Oh,

2171
02:13:39,070 --> 02:13:40,170
it's saved here.

2172
02:13:41,870 --> 02:13:42,850
Interesting.

2173
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:44,130
Okay.

2174
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:47,890
That could be worse.

2175
02:13:48,710 --> 02:13:49,750
Okay.

2176
02:13:50,370 --> 02:13:51,890
That could be worse.

2177
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:53,410
Okay.

2178
02:13:54,410 --> 02:13:56,630
I guess we at least keep the stuff that we got.

2179
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:07,980
I wish I had a little bottle that I could throw and distract him and have him walk over.

2180
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:09,600
That's what I need.

2181
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,000
I need to...

2182
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:15,240
It's this guy!

2183
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:25,440
I hope... I hope you... I hope you miss Christmas with your family every year for the rest of your life.

2184
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:28,740
Can you throw a gun?

2185
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:32,500
Let's try it.

2186
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:51,160
Don't shoot.

2187
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:51,520
Don't shoot.

2188
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:52,080
Don't shoot.

2189
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:52,460
Don't shoot.

2190
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:53,720
Don't shoot.

2191
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,300
Yeah, there we go.

2192
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:56,600
Gina!

2193
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:57,320
Gina.

2194
02:14:58,980 --> 02:14:59,460
Gina.

2195
02:14:59,980 --> 02:15:00,660
Okay, Gina.

2196
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:27,850
We need this guy to turn around.

2197
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:28,850
Please.

2198
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:35,430
Okay, he's gone.

2199
02:15:35,990 --> 02:15:37,330
Well, not gone, but you know.

2200
02:15:39,070 --> 02:15:40,350
Bit of a lag.

2201
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:40,870
Bit of a lag.

2202
02:15:42,830 --> 02:15:43,610
Oh, Gina.

2203
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:49,300
He's gonna see us.

2204
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:52,580
Maybe not.

2205
02:15:59,170 --> 02:16:00,350
Goodbye weapon.

2206
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:07,270
Oh my god.

2207
02:16:07,530 --> 02:16:08,090
Push her up.

2208
02:16:08,430 --> 02:16:09,410
Push her up.

2209
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:11,030
Gina, you're so possessed.

2210
02:16:11,110 --> 02:16:12,150
I don't like you anymore.

2211
02:16:15,090 --> 02:16:15,810
Okay.

2212
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:20,750
You okay?

2213
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:22,670
Good work.

2214
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:24,070
Yeah, shut up, please.

2215
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:25,810
Oh my god, you're so loud.

2216
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:27,190
What about me?

2217
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:29,890
Oh my god.

2218
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:32,510
This is a stealth mission.

2219
02:16:32,990 --> 02:16:32,990
Please.

2220
02:16:38,410 --> 02:16:42,220
Are there any other guys?

2221
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:43,060
Oh, it's saved.

2222
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:44,580
Oh, hallelujah.

2223
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:46,180
It's saved.

2224
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:47,980
Is there a guy up here?

2225
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:50,140
Did I see a little question mark?

2226
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:50,700
No?

2227
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:51,040
Okay.

2228
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:52,580
What else is...

2229
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:56,140
This is where...

2230
02:16:57,940 --> 02:16:59,380
What am I taking a picture of?

2231
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:01,060
The camp?

2232
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,140
That guy.

2233
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:09,860
That guy.

2234
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:11,980
Right there.

2235
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,380
Oh, I wish I could snipe him.

2236
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:19,300
Oh, I hate you with every... I don't have any bones in my body.

2237
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:21,780
I hate you!

2238
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:23,120
I hate you!

2239
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:24,920
Okay.

2240
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:26,500
Look at that.

2241
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,440
The giants did this.

2242
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:33,840
I don't think we need to be sneaky anymore, do we?

2243
02:17:41,630 --> 02:17:42,290
Wait!

2244
02:17:43,470 --> 02:17:44,350
Wait, Gina!

2245
02:17:44,850 --> 02:17:46,750
Gina, I think there's a...

2246
02:17:54,530 --> 02:17:54,650
Okay.

2247
02:17:58,590 --> 02:17:59,730
Bang,

2248
02:18:05,810 --> 02:18:06,150
bang, bang.

2249
02:18:07,050 --> 02:18:08,350
And here we go.

2250
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:10,450
Bye!

2251
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:13,830
Very good.

2252
02:18:28,390 --> 02:18:29,310
Wow.

2253
02:18:31,930 --> 02:18:33,990
Reverse MGS1 intro.

2254
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:41,090
You think there will be more nachos downstairs?

2255
02:18:43,090 --> 02:18:43,690
I'm so tired.

2256
02:18:46,330 --> 02:18:48,170
Nineveh document.

2257
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:52,250
Summary of translation of Stele S-12.

2258
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:58,810
The translation of the Sumerian carvings found in Stele S-12 in Antechamber F revealed interesting leads.

2259
02:18:59,150 --> 02:19:07,290
The ancient temple later built by the Ziggurat of Ur was raised by the descendants of those who survived.

2260
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:15,410
One of them traveled north with a sacred gift where they founded what would become the city of Nineveh.

2261
02:19:15,710 --> 02:19:16,230
Nineveh.

2262
02:19:16,510 --> 02:19:17,210
Nineveh.

2263
02:19:19,010 --> 02:19:19,570
Nineveh.

2264
02:19:19,590 --> 02:19:23,750
Perhaps this gift can still be found within the ruins of the ancient city.

2265
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:27,230
I will write a report to S.S.

2266
02:19:28,770 --> 02:19:34,970
Hoptampt, requesting this lead to be followed up after Operation Great Circle is complete.

2267
02:19:35,990 --> 02:19:40,330
There may be untold treasures to be found in Nineveh, or untold powers.

2268
02:19:40,810 --> 02:19:42,670
From Boss Emmerich.

2269
02:19:44,090 --> 02:19:46,050
Descendants of those who survived.

2270
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:48,750
Wait, what's that though?

2271
02:19:52,210 --> 02:19:53,630
We can take the lift.

2272
02:20:01,850 --> 02:20:07,910
I think she's already working on it.

2273
02:20:11,230 --> 02:20:11,950
Emmerich.

2274
02:20:15,610 --> 02:20:19,690
How did those other guys get up then if there's no power?

2275
02:20:20,530 --> 02:20:21,370
Do they also climb?

2276
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:32,260
Please no spoilers even about what the end is.

2277
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:33,260
Please no spoilers.

2278
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,920
Especially if you tag me.

2279
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:39,180
Come on.

2280
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:53,240
Come on.

2281
02:21:10,190 --> 02:21:13,450
Oh my gosh.

2282
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:20,690
Good thing I didn't eat the other...

2283
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:23,830
The other donut the other day.

2284
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:27,710
Wait, no power still?

2285
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:29,870
I guess, I mean...

2286
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:31,150
Generator where?

2287
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:32,950
Where did you see a generator?

2288
02:21:34,210 --> 02:21:35,030
I hear it.

2289
02:21:35,710 --> 02:21:36,150
Up that?

2290
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:36,810
There?

2291
02:21:37,050 --> 02:21:37,210
That?

2292
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:38,810
Can I make this?

2293
02:21:41,010 --> 02:21:43,030
I got it.

2294
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:50,110
Spoiler, the game ends at the end.

2295
02:21:51,690 --> 02:21:52,990
Just hit it.

2296
02:21:53,790 --> 02:21:57,370
One, two.

2297
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:02,330
There we go.

2298
02:22:06,370 --> 02:22:08,690
How do I...

2299
02:22:09,370 --> 02:22:13,090
Oh my gosh, can you imagine?

2300
02:22:13,450 --> 02:22:14,090
It's like alright.

2301
02:22:15,490 --> 02:22:17,410
Keep going down baby.

2302
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:29,190
Uh...

2303
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:31,410
Uh...

2304
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:33,410
Uh...

2305
02:22:34,290 --> 02:22:34,970
Oh...

2306
02:22:34,970 --> 02:22:36,410
I will?

2307
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:38,210
How do I get out of here?

2308
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:47,720
We made it down like two steps.

2309
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:51,600
I can?

2310
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:53,380
Oh my god.

2311
02:22:53,380 --> 02:22:56,060
Um, yeah.

2312
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:00,580
Nice.

2313
02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:05,000
What is blocking?

2314
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:07,980
Do I just keep going down?

2315
02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:08,800
What?

2316
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:14,460
Probably was a more graceful way to do that.

2317
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:18,580
But I'm not very grace... Grace is not my middle name.

2318
02:23:23,380 --> 02:23:24,880
I'm working on it.

2319
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:28,940
We died.

2320
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:29,900
Thanks for the diamonds.

2321
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:32,760
Yeah, I know.

2322
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:40,340
Keep going.

2323
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:42,600
Down.

2324
02:24:00,210 --> 02:24:01,230
Oh no!

2325
02:24:04,730 --> 02:24:06,290
Oh no.

2326
02:24:15,990 --> 02:24:16,950
Yeah.

2327
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:19,290
Oh, no we're not.

2328
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:23,470
We're like besties.

2329
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:24,890
Love that guy.

2330
02:24:27,490 --> 02:24:27,910
Okay.

2331
02:24:28,390 --> 02:24:30,150
There's stuff around here.

2332
02:24:30,890 --> 02:24:32,030
What's this?

2333
02:24:33,310 --> 02:24:34,370
Oh, Gina?

2334
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:37,930
I guess we're opening this.

2335
02:24:40,090 --> 02:24:42,890
Oh, I didn't get to explore the other.

2336
02:24:44,650 --> 02:24:45,550
My bad.

2337
02:24:59,470 --> 02:25:01,170
What is this?

2338
02:25:01,170 --> 02:25:03,870
Is that what I think it is?

2339
02:25:05,230 --> 02:25:06,130
What do you think it is?

2340
02:25:08,590 --> 02:25:09,430
It's real?

2341
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:16,660
That's what I thought, but...

2342
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:17,320
Oh no.

2343
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:26,640
I don't know.

2344
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:36,440
Uh oh.

2345
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:39,860
He's going to ride the boat through time.

2346
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:45,400
Be the great...

2347
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:54,100
Now what?

2348
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:54,480
What?

2349
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:05,560
Oh my god, no.

2350
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,220
Please, I need Gina.

2351
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:08,120
I need your fists.

2352
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:09,180
Just in case.

2353
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:13,260
Please.

2354
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:27,950
Ta-da!

2355
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:32,270
No, don't go down yet Indy.

2356
02:26:32,390 --> 02:26:34,390
I didn't get to explore the other area.

2357
02:26:37,010 --> 02:26:38,590
Let me back up!

2358
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:39,710
Hold on.

2359
02:26:40,890 --> 02:26:41,990
Get to the tent.

2360
02:26:42,110 --> 02:26:42,630
Okay, hold on.

2361
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:44,650
But before that...

2362
02:26:45,710 --> 02:26:49,150
Damn, no wonder the giants didn't make it past anywhere.

2363
02:26:49,550 --> 02:26:50,830
There's so many...

2364
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:52,930
There's so many guys in here.

2365
02:26:57,110 --> 02:26:58,450
Secret vault.

2366
02:26:59,090 --> 02:26:59,830
Four stars.

2367
02:27:04,730 --> 02:27:06,410
What the hell?

2368
02:27:08,430 --> 02:27:09,530
Did they make this?

2369
02:27:10,730 --> 02:27:12,030
Arks and all gear.

2370
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:16,330
Indy found both arks.

2371
02:27:16,470 --> 02:27:17,490
I know, right?

2372
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:19,350
What is that?

2373
02:27:21,450 --> 02:27:23,550
They had a lot to say apparently.

2374
02:27:24,950 --> 02:27:27,350
Hold on, I want to make sure that I've...

2375
02:27:28,390 --> 02:27:30,750
Look, we got button then.

2376
02:27:30,890 --> 02:27:31,870
What was this?

2377
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:36,170
One-handed firearms deal more damage.

2378
02:27:39,390 --> 02:27:40,010
Nice.

2379
02:27:41,210 --> 02:27:43,030
I think that's the only one we have.

2380
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:45,070
Yeah, unfortunately.

2381
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:46,450
Oh well.

2382
02:27:48,170 --> 02:27:48,570
Okay.

2383
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:53,810
This is so sick!

2384
02:27:55,650 --> 02:27:56,590
Oops, there we go.

2385
02:27:57,130 --> 02:27:57,770
I'm just slow.

2386
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:02,170
Yeah, I have a ton of points.

2387
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:03,970
I wish I had more books.

2388
02:28:04,590 --> 02:28:05,470
But I'm also poor.

2389
02:28:07,410 --> 02:28:08,770
There's also a pier.

2390
02:28:09,650 --> 02:28:11,530
Like, it looks like I can climb up here.

2391
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:14,110
So I kind of want to do that real quick to see...

2392
02:28:14,110 --> 02:28:15,070
Just...

2393
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:17,590
What's...

2394
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:18,290
Nevermind.

2395
02:28:18,830 --> 02:28:21,090
Indy's arms are like a T-Rex.

2396
02:28:22,050 --> 02:28:23,890
Teeny tiny little baby.

2397
02:28:26,670 --> 02:28:27,890
Okay, nevermind.

2398
02:28:28,210 --> 02:28:30,130
I have explored everything apparently.

2399
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:33,310
I thought there may be...

2400
02:28:34,930 --> 02:28:36,290
He looks so peaceful.

2401
02:28:36,990 --> 02:28:37,770
Wake up, giant.

2402
02:28:38,470 --> 02:28:40,230
I'm gonna be like that pig in that video.

2403
02:28:45,090 --> 02:28:46,350
Oh, peaceful.

2404
02:28:46,970 --> 02:28:47,870
I hope they're not dead.

2405
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:49,210
Do you think they're asleep or dead?

2406
02:28:51,810 --> 02:28:53,190
Okay, here we go!

2407
02:29:02,820 --> 02:29:04,100
This game...

2408
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:08,060
This game knows how to do really great visuals.

2409
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:10,900
Like...

2410
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:13,260
Really great, like...

2411
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:13,580
Wow...

2412
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:15,300
Wow...

2413
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:18,300
Wow...

2414
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:20,740
Is it moving?

2415
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:23,580
Or am I crazy?

2416
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:27,300
Like, is it kind of like...

2417
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:30,300
No, I don't think so.

2418
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:33,800
I thought it might be...

2419
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,040
I'm crazy?

2420
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:37,040
Maybe.

2421
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:40,920
To the tent!

2422
02:29:49,230 --> 02:29:51,570
Oh, there's a hammer right there.

2423
02:29:51,870 --> 02:29:52,650
There's a mallet.

2424
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:00,500
Don't see me.

2425
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:05,980
Oh my god, there's so many guys around.

2426
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:06,360
Wait!

2427
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:11,000
What the?

2428
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:15,680
Oh, he's chilling?

2429
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,180
Let's take a little break.

2430
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:19,240
Wow!

2431
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,100
It's huge!

2432
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:24,380
Look, there's even guys patrolling through there.

2433
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:31,400
This isn't gonna be very fun now, is it?

2434
02:30:45,030 --> 02:30:47,130
Is that the giant or is that...

2435
02:30:47,690 --> 02:30:48,790
I can't tell.

2436
02:30:51,670 --> 02:30:52,610
Who are you?

2437
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:54,630
Oh, you're not the giant.

2438
02:31:00,490 --> 02:31:02,290
Oh, you do have guns in here.

2439
02:31:02,450 --> 02:31:03,470
I don't like that.

2440
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:04,650
Don't do that.

2441
02:31:04,910 --> 02:31:05,970
No, shoot the kill!

2442
02:31:06,330 --> 02:31:06,990
Shoot the kill!

2443
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:09,050
Where did you come from?

2444
02:31:10,290 --> 02:31:11,090
Oh my god.

2445
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:14,070
I'm getting ganged up on.

2446
02:31:14,110 --> 02:31:14,750
This isn't fair.

2447
02:31:18,070 --> 02:31:19,710
My grandma hits harder.

2448
02:31:21,070 --> 02:31:23,510
I don't think we're making it out of this one, but...

2449
02:31:23,510 --> 02:31:24,430
Can I have my hat?

2450
02:31:25,310 --> 02:31:27,570
They're spawn camping me.

2451
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:33,090
We look so smug for the situation that we're in.

2452
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:34,190
It's quite dire.

2453
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:39,630
Okay.

2454
02:31:41,490 --> 02:31:42,910
Take that.

2455
02:31:43,310 --> 02:31:44,070
Take that.

2456
02:31:44,630 --> 02:31:45,050
Nice.

2457
02:31:46,970 --> 02:31:47,810
Cool.

2458
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:51,810
Oh, okay.

2459
02:31:51,970 --> 02:31:52,690
I'm gonna heal.

2460
02:31:52,690 --> 02:31:56,090
In case this actually works out.

2461
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:06,130
Where did my weapon go?

2462
02:32:06,310 --> 02:32:07,350
Is that the weapon I just grabbed?

2463
02:32:11,570 --> 02:32:12,450
What was that?

2464
02:32:15,650 --> 02:32:16,170
Okay.

2465
02:32:18,970 --> 02:32:21,470
I thought I grabbed something better than that.

2466
02:32:26,050 --> 02:32:26,690
Okay.

2467
02:32:27,010 --> 02:32:27,470
Alright.

2468
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:29,130
Let's continue onward.

2469
02:32:32,070 --> 02:32:34,070
La la la.

2470
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:40,340
This might be a better way anyway.

2471
02:32:49,090 --> 02:32:49,720
Nice.

2472
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:51,300
Nice.

2473
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:52,940
Stealth 100.

2474
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:56,860
Stealth 99.

2475
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:01,220
Okay.

2476
02:33:16,450 --> 02:33:16,910
Okay.

2477
02:33:19,030 --> 02:33:20,710
I wish I could see through here.

2478
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:25,270
Go up.

2479
02:33:25,470 --> 02:33:26,030
I don't think...

2480
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:26,790
Oh, I can.

2481
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:29,350
Oh my gosh.

2482
02:33:30,510 --> 02:33:31,730
How did you see that?

2483
02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:34,470
Indy, please.

2484
02:33:35,070 --> 02:33:35,270
Indy.

2485
02:33:37,950 --> 02:33:38,970
Oh my god.

2486
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:41,790
How did you see that?

2487
02:33:42,730 --> 02:33:44,250
Oh look, there's a ton of them too.

2488
02:33:44,730 --> 02:33:46,770
I wonder if I could just start throwing...

2489
02:33:47,350 --> 02:33:49,670
I could just start throwing hammers at everybody.

2490
02:33:55,750 --> 02:33:57,050
We're so close.

2491
02:33:57,130 --> 02:33:58,430
It's right there.

2492
02:33:59,270 --> 02:34:00,970
I need this guy to go away.

2493
02:34:03,210 --> 02:34:06,110
Do you think he'll notice if I throw a hammer at him?

2494
02:34:06,590 --> 02:34:08,030
He's kinda far now though, right?

2495
02:34:12,030 --> 02:34:16,030
There's like so... It's like all in the light so I know I'm gonna get seen.

2496
02:34:17,730 --> 02:34:21,990
And he's looking straight where we need to go.

2497
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:26,430
And he took out his weapon for what?

2498
02:34:26,970 --> 02:34:28,330
Okay, this might be our chance.

2499
02:34:28,850 --> 02:34:29,350
Oh my gosh.

2500
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:33,470
I think this is our chance.

2501
02:34:34,050 --> 02:34:34,670
Just go, go, go.

2502
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:37,400
Nothing.

2503
02:34:37,860 --> 02:34:38,580
Who's seeing me?

2504
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:39,180
No one.

2505
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:39,880
Yeah, exactly.

2506
02:34:42,370 --> 02:34:42,820
Nice.

2507
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:52,740
Locus!

2508
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:56,460
I thought you were by the campfire.

2509
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:00,800
I saw another...

2510
02:35:01,700 --> 02:35:02,580
Bald man.

2511
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:20,030
Oh my God.

2512
02:35:20,450 --> 02:35:21,490
Why do you have that?

2513
02:35:22,650 --> 02:35:26,730
You found the Ark of the Covenant, yes, but I found Noah's Ark.

2514
02:35:28,610 --> 02:35:30,230
What makes you think it's the real one?

2515
02:35:30,310 --> 02:35:31,270
Come on, Indiana.

2516
02:35:33,530 --> 02:35:36,030
Please, isn't it time we dispense with the patterns already?

2517
02:35:36,250 --> 02:35:38,990
Why don't you and I have a meeting of the minds instead?

2518
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:41,190
We're gonna have a nerd-off.

2519
02:35:42,390 --> 02:35:46,330
What if it starts asking me questions of like smarts?

2520
02:35:46,490 --> 02:35:49,670
What I'd like to do is put the guns down.

2521
02:35:49,690 --> 02:35:50,750
I have it like that too.

2522
02:35:50,750 --> 02:35:53,750
I'll knock your teeth out.

2523
02:35:55,350 --> 02:35:56,390
Fair warning.

2524
02:35:57,910 --> 02:36:02,030
I have mastered the lethal Japanese hand-to-hand combat art.

2525
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:02,950
CQC?

2526
02:36:03,950 --> 02:36:04,630
Karate!

2527
02:36:05,390 --> 02:36:09,470
Well, I can just have my gacha with you.

2528
02:36:10,130 --> 02:36:10,810
Karate!

2529
02:36:13,550 --> 02:36:14,230
Dareweave!

2530
02:36:15,790 --> 02:36:18,610
What do you know about the myth of the Great Flood?

2531
02:36:20,750 --> 02:36:22,690
He got one of every animal.

2532
02:36:23,890 --> 02:36:25,150
Girl and boy.

2533
02:36:35,430 --> 02:36:37,850
I played that one racing game.

2534
02:36:40,350 --> 02:36:41,230
Karate!

2535
02:36:41,230 --> 02:36:41,650
Teh!

2536
02:36:48,850 --> 02:36:50,870
I know, Vos is so funny.

2537
02:36:57,770 --> 02:36:59,990
We love a funny villain, right?

2538
02:37:03,970 --> 02:37:05,630
Roberto, welcome to the membership.

2539
02:37:05,850 --> 02:37:06,270
Thank you.

2540
02:37:06,270 --> 02:37:09,950
I know one you haven't heard of.

2541
02:37:11,130 --> 02:37:12,710
Tell me a bedtime story.

2542
02:37:12,910 --> 02:37:15,970
Come, come.

2543
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:24,130
I don't think this is...I don't think...I don't think this is a...

2544
02:37:24,130 --> 02:37:25,330
Yeah, you should grab that.

2545
02:37:25,930 --> 02:37:26,450
Oh!

2546
02:37:28,410 --> 02:37:29,170
An Among Us!

2547
02:37:29,790 --> 02:37:31,370
They were showing us the Among Us.

2548
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:34,030
From an excavation in North Africa.

2549
02:37:36,150 --> 02:37:37,090
Ah!

2550
02:37:42,430 --> 02:37:46,110
I love when the baddies just say...

2551
02:37:47,630 --> 02:37:48,100
Everything...

2552
02:37:48,570 --> 02:37:49,590
Their whole plan, you know?

2553
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:02,060
Dark...

2554
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:05,000
Seventeen?

2555
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:06,820
We only have two.

2556
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:09,520
Seventeen stones, seventeen words.

2557
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:14,280
Each stone connected to one of the locations of the Great Circle.

2558
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:18,760
Noir used the stones to gather animals from around the world.

2559
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:21,820
And then, after the flood was over...

2560
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:24,760
To repopulate the earth.

2561
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:30,040
And the stones were left hidden at each of the Great Circle's sites...

2562
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:32,200
You know, fish were so happy during that time.

2563
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:35,320
They were like...

2564
02:38:35,320 --> 02:38:35,480
Yeah!

2565
02:38:36,060 --> 02:38:37,100
Our time has come!

2566
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:45,500
Golden Age of Fish.

2567
02:38:47,700 --> 02:38:50,800
They could have literally taken over if they were smarter.

2568
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:54,220
Keep them what?

2569
02:38:55,500 --> 02:39:00,700
Yeah, that's kind of what that guy's been really trying to do for...

2570
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:01,800
What?

2571
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:10,320
I'm Indy.

2572
02:39:10,620 --> 02:39:11,480
I mean...

2573
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:15,180
If you have found this, you probably would have been looking for it too.

2574
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:15,800
Let's be honest.

2575
02:39:32,630 --> 02:39:33,820
Is that her sister?

2576
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:46,860
Oh, shit.

2577
02:39:51,580 --> 02:39:52,460
Ma'am?

2578
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:55,720
Gina?!

2579
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:57,780
Gina, do it.

2580
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:59,480
What a preposterous woman.

2581
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:01,260
And now she's dead.

2582
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:02,240
Gina, do it.

2583
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:03,880
Gina, do it!

2584
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:07,420
We should have just done it.

2585
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,040
Gina, do it.

2586
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:17,400
Oh!

2587
02:40:22,480 --> 02:40:23,520
Oh, no!

2588
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:27,980
Gina, you should have checked!

2589
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,300
Like a rat.

2590
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:36,220
Like a rat.

2591
02:40:37,220 --> 02:40:38,240
Like a rat.

2592
02:40:45,820 --> 02:40:47,220
No!

2593
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:53,460
Oh my...

2594
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:00,300
Boss, listen to me.

2595
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:03,260
You're messing with powers beyond your control.

2596
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:04,240
No!

2597
02:41:05,060 --> 02:41:06,080
My whip!

2598
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:10,340
Oh my god.

2599
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:21,940
He rubs the lotion on his skin.

2600
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:30,180
Toxic yaoi.

2601
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:42,650
How is this thing still intact?

2602
02:41:43,850 --> 02:41:45,550
How is it not falling apart?

2603
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:57,870
Yeah, it's a big ol' boat.

2604
02:41:59,150 --> 02:42:00,150
Lake Hamar?

2605
02:42:00,830 --> 02:42:02,050
Boss, an Indy fan?

2606
02:42:02,450 --> 02:42:03,170
Wants to collab?

2607
02:42:04,270 --> 02:42:05,450
With his Oshi?

2608
02:42:05,650 --> 02:42:06,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2609
02:42:08,810 --> 02:42:09,870
Cool shy.

2610
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:10,690
I know, right?

2611
02:42:11,210 --> 02:42:13,910
This game is really good with the cinematics.

2612
02:42:18,050 --> 02:42:19,430
He's cooking it with him!

2613
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:43,610
I'm calm.

2614
02:42:43,810 --> 02:42:44,310
I'm cool.

2615
02:42:44,510 --> 02:42:45,470
I'm as cool as a cucumber.

2616
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:56,390
I spoke too soon, Indiana Jones.

2617
02:43:18,190 --> 02:43:18,590
Oh...

2618
02:43:18,590 --> 02:43:20,050
Does he know the words?

2619
02:43:21,470 --> 02:43:22,730
Does he know the words to say?

2620
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:25,150
I like how they're all so colorful.

2621
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:26,690
They look like forbidden candy.

2622
02:43:27,310 --> 02:43:28,830
I want to eat the stones.

2623
02:43:40,690 --> 02:43:42,510
In front of my house!

2624
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:52,330
And then finally, Indiana Jones will be yours.

2625
02:43:59,490 --> 02:44:00,950
Oh, come on.

2626
02:44:02,610 --> 02:44:03,470
Okay.

2627
02:44:06,990 --> 02:44:08,650
Poor Locus.

2628
02:44:09,950 --> 02:44:11,010
Yaoi whip.

2629
02:44:12,630 --> 02:44:14,290
That's the yaoi whip.

2630
02:44:14,770 --> 02:44:17,650
Anyone who touches it becomes a...

2631
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:22,150
He's so corny.

2632
02:44:22,370 --> 02:44:23,770
I'm kind of obsessed.

2633
02:44:25,110 --> 02:44:25,830
So funny.

2634
02:44:28,910 --> 02:44:30,390
Oh, Locus.

2635
02:44:30,930 --> 02:44:35,770
Guys, I think things are about to get a little... a little freaky.

2636
02:44:37,350 --> 02:44:40,690
I think things are about to get a little freaky.

2637
02:44:43,430 --> 02:44:44,730
Oh, he's saying it.

2638
02:44:45,410 --> 02:44:46,790
He doesn't know the words.

2639
02:44:52,850 --> 02:44:53,890
Oh, sorry.

2640
02:44:55,150 --> 02:44:56,390
I'm in a cutscene.

2641
02:44:56,570 --> 02:44:57,890
What are you... Excuse me.

2642
02:44:57,990 --> 02:45:00,350
Of course I'm not using my controller.

2643
02:45:00,570 --> 02:45:01,110
Sorry everybody.

2644
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:05,830
Maybe I need to be like looking around that you expect me to?

2645
02:45:05,930 --> 02:45:06,330
I don't know.

2646
02:45:10,570 --> 02:45:11,950
Ears of a hawk.

2647
02:45:12,030 --> 02:45:12,770
Excuse me.

2648
02:45:23,350 --> 02:45:24,390
Oh no.

2649
02:45:26,030 --> 02:45:27,250
He's freaking out.

2650
02:45:27,630 --> 02:45:28,670
He's losing it.

2651
02:45:31,130 --> 02:45:31,530
Nice.

2652
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:39,170
Oh my God.

2653
02:45:39,250 --> 02:45:39,750
Oh my God.

2654
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:40,310
Oh my God.

2655
02:45:40,370 --> 02:45:41,350
Oh my God.

2656
02:46:04,210 --> 02:46:04,910
Oh my God.

2657
02:46:12,890 --> 02:46:15,270
Flat Earth time.

2658
02:46:15,690 --> 02:46:15,690
Yeah!

2659
02:46:16,230 --> 02:46:17,890
Oh no!

2660
02:46:18,670 --> 02:46:20,150
We're about to get squished!

2661
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:20,310
Squished.

2662
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:43,180
He can't read.

2663
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:44,560
He got one wrong.

2664
02:46:49,780 --> 02:46:51,580
What's so funny Indiana Jones?

2665
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:00,540
I don't know.

2666
02:47:07,900 --> 02:47:11,020
What is he... Did he just start like another flood?

2667
02:47:31,450 --> 02:47:32,410
Oh boy.

2668
02:47:32,630 --> 02:47:33,310
Oh boy.

2669
02:47:53,070 --> 02:47:54,290
Guys, it's getting freaky!

2670
02:47:57,850 --> 02:47:59,010
Oh my God!

2671
02:47:59,210 --> 02:48:00,270
Oh my God!

2672
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:07,660
You said you knew what you were doing!

2673
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:13,500
Kuwabara!

2674
02:48:13,740 --> 02:48:14,460
Kuwabara!

2675
02:48:17,460 --> 02:48:18,940
Yeah, do Locus first.

2676
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:22,800
What do you mean?

2677
02:48:28,340 --> 02:48:29,060
Lies!

2678
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:31,620
He summoned Heavy Rain.

2679
02:48:38,020 --> 02:48:39,220
He's so crazy.

2680
02:48:41,820 --> 02:48:42,780
Yeah, get his ass!

2681
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:43,960
Oh, what am I supposed to do?

2682
02:48:46,220 --> 02:48:47,440
Yeah, give me...help me.

2683
02:48:47,980 --> 02:48:49,080
Oh no no!

2684
02:48:52,300 --> 02:48:52,820
Hello!

2685
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:55,940
Oh my God!

2686
02:48:55,940 --> 02:48:57,960
Oh my God, he's so nimble.

2687
02:48:58,240 --> 02:48:59,080
He's nimble.

2688
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:02,040
That's not fair.

2689
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:02,940
That's not fair.

2690
02:49:03,460 --> 02:49:04,040
That's so unfair.

2691
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:12,020
Oh, he's got really long legs.

2692
02:49:12,580 --> 02:49:13,820
How the hell...

2693
02:49:14,900 --> 02:49:16,620
I don't remember how to dodge.

2694
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:18,520
Oh shoot.

2695
02:49:21,080 --> 02:49:22,240
I don't remember.

2696
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:24,880
Ok,

2697
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:30,620
if you get too far from him...

2698
02:49:31,340 --> 02:49:33,040
Oh my God, he's so

2699
02:49:38,530 --> 02:49:39,030
nimble.

2700
02:49:39,710 --> 02:49:40,970
How is it...hold on.

2701
02:49:43,750 --> 02:49:47,850
What was the...and you don't have your hat, so you don't have the lucky hat anymore.

2702
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:52,090
What was the controls to sidestep and everything?

2703
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:52,730
You guys remember?

2704
02:49:53,650 --> 02:49:54,590
A and move?

2705
02:49:54,730 --> 02:49:55,350
Ok, thank you.

2706
02:49:57,430 --> 02:49:58,750
Yeah, LB is blocked.

2707
02:49:58,850 --> 02:50:00,870
I do know that, but you still take damage, you know.

2708
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:10,510
Oh my God, but I'm trying to...I'm trying!

2709
02:50:10,710 --> 02:50:11,190
Hold on!

2710
02:50:20,030 --> 02:50:20,490
Oh!

2711
02:50:20,490 --> 02:50:20,950
Oh!

2712
02:50:21,350 --> 02:50:21,590
Oh!

2713
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:26,470
Oh gosh!

2714
02:50:31,490 --> 02:50:34,190
Yes, idiot!

2715
02:50:43,150 --> 02:50:44,690
Where are you going, eh baby?

2716
02:50:46,730 --> 02:50:46,730
Oh ouch.

2717
02:50:46,750 --> 02:50:47,690
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2718
02:50:47,710 --> 02:50:50,010
I thought I would be able to...

2719
02:50:51,630 --> 02:50:52,530
Oh my God!

2720
02:50:53,290 --> 02:50:55,250
I don't have any of my items.

2721
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:55,990
Oh shit!

2722
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:58,170
I was doing so well.

2723
02:50:59,330 --> 02:51:01,470
I was doing alright for a second.

2724
02:51:04,430 --> 02:51:05,910
His karate is crazy.

2725
02:51:07,710 --> 02:51:08,990
That chop did not hit.

2726
02:51:09,030 --> 02:51:10,350
I know, what's my hitbox, eh?

2727
02:51:11,070 --> 02:51:12,030
Where's my hitbox anyway?

2728
02:51:13,230 --> 02:51:14,430
I'm not going anywhere.

2729
02:51:14,990 --> 02:51:15,830
Yeah, that's right.

2730
02:51:17,890 --> 02:51:23,010
Circle strafe, circle strafe, circle strafe, circle strafe, circle strafe...

2731
02:51:26,230 --> 02:51:27,290
Oh, I have none.

2732
02:51:30,830 --> 02:51:33,470
Yeah, dummy!

2733
02:51:34,330 --> 02:51:34,990
Circle strafe!

2734
02:51:35,050 --> 02:51:36,890
Oh my God, I'm trapped, I'm trapped on something.

2735
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:39,570
Oh my God.

2736
02:51:40,970 --> 02:51:41,290
No!

2737
02:51:47,670 --> 02:51:49,650
Oh, I dodged that though.

2738
02:51:50,090 --> 02:51:50,710
Such bullshit.

2739
02:51:56,870 --> 02:51:58,710
I'm just building up my... what's it called?

2740
02:52:06,910 --> 02:52:07,770
My stamina.

2741
02:52:09,150 --> 02:52:09,270
Yeah, yeah.

2742
02:52:15,770 --> 02:52:16,710
You're obsessed?

2743
02:52:18,590 --> 02:52:22,150
Gosh, this is just like fighting on top of a Metal Gear, isn't it?

2744
02:52:25,550 --> 02:52:28,970
I don't think that does damage, so it's not so bad.

2745
02:52:37,290 --> 02:52:38,630
You little bastard!

2746
02:52:45,070 --> 02:52:48,430
I thought I was supposed to go help Gina, but she's got it handled, I think.

2747
02:52:53,970 --> 02:52:55,150
But you're in love?

2748
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:05,730
Oh no.

2749
02:53:31,830 --> 02:53:33,890
My controller is like doing heartbeats.

2750
02:53:34,130 --> 02:53:36,170
Oh my god!

2751
02:53:36,350 --> 02:53:36,910
Oh my god!

2752
02:53:37,090 --> 02:53:37,970
Oh my god!

2753
02:53:38,450 --> 02:53:41,430
This guy is literally gonna take me down with him!

2754
02:53:41,570 --> 02:53:42,350
Oh my god!

2755
02:53:46,730 --> 02:53:47,710
What is this?

2756
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:55,230
Wait, are we gonna have to fight here?

2757
02:53:55,570 --> 02:53:56,790
Please god no.

2758
02:53:57,430 --> 02:53:58,350
This is... no.

2759
02:53:58,450 --> 02:53:59,050
Oh my god.

2760
02:54:10,130 --> 02:54:12,570
I'm gonna... I have 1 HP and a dream baby!

2761
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:16,470
Karate!

2762
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:20,820
Maybe.

2763
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:25,180
I'm like trying to block, but...

2764
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:29,960
I still take damage.

2765
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:37,620
I think I just have to last.

2766
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:42,220
Help Gina please!

2767
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:46,100
Yeah, kick him.

2768
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:47,540
I'm blocking.

2769
02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:49,200
I'm punching.

2770
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:49,780
I'm kicking.

2771
02:54:50,500 --> 02:54:50,840
I'm blocking.

2772
02:54:53,740 --> 02:54:55,500
This is so stupid.

2773
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:02,680
Help me!

2774
02:55:03,400 --> 02:55:04,440
Thank you.

2775
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:10,700
Atonement.

2776
02:55:12,020 --> 02:55:13,060
Grab my whip!

2777
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:14,780
Grab my whip please!

2778
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:19,360
Uh oh.

2779
02:55:23,290 --> 02:55:23,870
Locus.

2780
02:55:27,870 --> 02:55:28,450
Yes!

2781
02:55:36,680 --> 02:55:39,780
I was stuck on this for 30 minutes and he did a second try.

2782
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:41,740
I told you.

2783
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:48,460
When yaoi on the brain, anything is possible.

2784
02:55:56,440 --> 02:55:57,620
Get swept up.

2785
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:04,120
Honestly the side-sweep, like the circle around him while I'm punching, I think did well.

2786
02:56:07,580 --> 02:56:08,680
Oh my god.

2787
02:56:10,900 --> 02:56:11,520
Locus!

2788
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:14,060
What is he trying to do?

2789
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:15,300
What is this?

2790
02:56:16,680 --> 02:56:18,680
Oh my god, give up!

2791
02:56:19,800 --> 02:56:20,760
Give up!

2792
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:21,020
Give up!

2793
02:56:21,320 --> 02:56:24,760
You are so annoying!

2794
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:32,180
Glad you like it.

2795
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:43,740
Everyone is always telling me I'm so ugly!

2796
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:48,020
Locus you got this!

2797
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:52,820
Karate.

2798
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,400
Karate!

2799
02:57:27,300 --> 02:57:27,700
Oh

2800
02:57:32,620 --> 02:57:35,580
my god, I think that's finally it for him baby!

2801
02:57:38,120 --> 02:57:38,920
Yay!

2802
02:57:39,060 --> 02:57:39,700
Reposo!

2803
02:57:47,390 --> 02:57:48,990
Indiana Jones!

2804
02:57:49,970 --> 02:57:50,430
Locus!

2805
02:57:51,970 --> 02:57:54,270
Off boat now!

2806
02:57:54,630 --> 02:57:54,890
Ok.

2807
02:57:55,570 --> 02:57:57,010
Off boat now.

2808
02:58:00,090 --> 02:58:01,650
Ok we trust you!

2809
02:58:01,790 --> 02:58:02,730
We trust you Locus!

2810
02:58:04,910 --> 02:58:06,390
You don't know how to swim!

2811
02:58:06,910 --> 02:58:07,250
Uh oh.

2812
02:58:07,530 --> 02:58:08,730
She gonna learn.

2813
02:58:18,430 --> 02:58:19,650
Oh my god.

2814
02:58:20,110 --> 02:58:20,990
Oh my god.

2815
02:58:20,990 --> 02:58:24,010
Oh it's teleporting somewhere!

2816
02:58:27,070 --> 02:58:28,070
Where?

2817
02:58:31,430 --> 02:58:32,430
Isekai!

2818
02:58:33,870 --> 02:58:34,610
Locus!

2819
02:58:35,010 --> 02:58:36,470
You did well buddy!

2820
02:58:37,150 --> 02:58:38,390
You did well!

2821
02:58:39,690 --> 02:58:41,350
Locus going into the light!

2822
02:58:45,330 --> 02:58:46,330
07.

2823
02:58:46,530 --> 02:58:48,410
07 for Locus.

2824
02:58:49,010 --> 02:58:50,390
What the hell was that?

2825
02:58:52,730 --> 02:58:55,090
Please be a world with cute anime girls.

2826
02:58:55,450 --> 02:58:56,390
I'm sure it is.

2827
02:58:57,510 --> 02:58:58,870
I'm sure it is.

2828
02:59:10,820 --> 02:59:11,420
Locus.

2829
02:59:11,880 --> 02:59:14,360
He sacrificed himself!

2830
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:18,080
Time I got reincarnated in another world with Noah's Ark.

2831
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:26,080
So I guess like the wheel would like...

2832
02:59:26,840 --> 02:59:30,560
You could steer it to activate the portal?

2833
02:59:37,400 --> 02:59:39,020
I don't really understand.

2834
02:59:39,740 --> 02:59:41,740
I don't really understand what's going on.

2835
02:59:45,630 --> 02:59:48,590
If it loves you it will come back.

2836
02:59:49,730 --> 02:59:53,790
You let it go and if it loves you it will return.

2837
03:00:04,770 --> 03:00:06,330
Is that not the boat?

2838
03:00:22,090 --> 03:00:22,810
Thank you.

2839
03:00:24,490 --> 03:00:26,950
So do you want to stick around for a little while?

2840
03:00:27,030 --> 03:00:27,650
I got some friends.

2841
03:00:28,170 --> 03:00:29,590
You could show us the sights.

2842
03:00:30,710 --> 03:00:31,650
There's a war coming.

2843
03:00:33,110 --> 03:00:35,150
And I have a hell of a story to tell.

2844
03:00:37,530 --> 03:00:40,410
And I think you will be too busy chasing the past.

2845
03:00:40,630 --> 03:00:42,530
Oh that's what his last girl said too.

2846
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:43,150
I don't know.

2847
03:00:45,270 --> 03:00:47,050
I think I could make room for other things.

2848
03:00:48,290 --> 03:00:48,710
Well not me.

2849
03:00:48,710 --> 03:00:50,090
Not now.

2850
03:00:51,910 --> 03:00:53,550
Too much is at stake.

2851
03:00:56,010 --> 03:00:57,270
Adios Rambo.

2852
03:00:58,630 --> 03:00:59,470
Adios.

2853
03:01:01,830 --> 03:01:03,450
Not even a kiss.

2854
03:01:03,530 --> 03:01:04,390
Not even on the cheek.

2855
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:07,270
We fumbled hard guys.

2856
03:01:10,010 --> 03:01:10,850
Josh!

2857
03:01:15,950 --> 03:01:16,790
Laura.

2858
03:01:27,300 --> 03:01:27,480
Ah!

2859
03:01:34,120 --> 03:01:35,960
She heard you.

2860
03:02:00,430 --> 03:02:01,130
Lude.

2861
03:02:02,850 --> 03:02:06,480
Is this really it?

2862
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:08,560
Is this really the end of the game?

2863
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:22,120
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle!

2864
03:02:23,060 --> 03:02:24,200
What the hell was

2865
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:45,260
the...

2866
03:02:45,260 --> 03:02:47,120
It was the steering wheel.

2867
03:02:47,300 --> 03:02:47,460
OK.

2868
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:49,720
I expected something greater.

2869
03:02:49,940 --> 03:02:50,660
I don't know.

2870
03:02:56,180 --> 03:02:59,200
The Great Circle was Indy's relationship.

2871
03:03:02,620 --> 03:03:08,300
No, it was a... I think it should have been named like the Mysterious Circle because what the hell.

2872
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:17,020
Teleporting arc was kinda cool.

2873
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:18,120
Pretty cool yeah.

2874
03:03:19,180 --> 03:03:20,400
I wonder where it went.

2875
03:03:20,760 --> 03:03:21,780
I'm so curious.

2876
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:24,240
I could never be Indiana Jones.

2877
03:03:24,380 --> 03:03:25,420
I would have never jumped.

2878
03:03:25,960 --> 03:03:27,220
I would have gone with him.

2879
03:03:27,220 --> 03:03:28,620
Where did it go?

2880
03:03:30,360 --> 03:03:33,080
The Great Circle is the people we fought along the way.

2881
03:03:35,900 --> 03:03:37,400
This music is great.

2882
03:03:38,060 --> 03:03:41,140
Gran Tinto that was fine and now another game down on your resolution list.

2883
03:03:41,480 --> 03:03:41,660
Yeah!

2884
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:45,000
The Great Circle is the friends we made along the way.

2885
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:47,180
I wonder if there is an after credits thing.

2886
03:03:57,910 --> 03:03:59,230
Indiana Jones though.

2887
03:04:00,350 --> 03:04:02,690
He doesn't always really figure out what a thing is.

2888
03:04:02,690 --> 03:04:05,170
Just something crazy.

2889
03:04:06,850 --> 03:04:07,570
Teleportation.

2890
03:04:08,470 --> 03:04:10,690
We had the Calimao.

2891
03:04:11,350 --> 03:04:13,270
We had the Ark.

2892
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:18,230
So crazy.

2893
03:04:22,670 --> 03:04:23,670
You need to tell me.

2894
03:04:24,390 --> 03:04:26,490
You built a time machine out of a bone.

2895
03:04:27,670 --> 03:04:28,750
That's like soul.

2896
03:04:29,570 --> 03:04:31,410
That's basically Doraemon.

2897
03:04:34,090 --> 03:04:35,390
Or Doctor Who.

2898
03:04:37,190 --> 03:04:37,910
Congrats Mito.

2899
03:04:38,030 --> 03:04:42,790
By the way, the secret ball you saw was a post game puzzle that takes all 50 of the Among Us to complete.

2900
03:04:43,550 --> 03:04:44,410
Wait, secret ball.

2901
03:04:46,410 --> 03:04:48,090
You get a cutscene after that.

2902
03:04:48,190 --> 03:04:48,890
You might want to look it up.

2903
03:04:50,750 --> 03:04:51,150
Interesting.

2904
03:04:52,550 --> 03:04:53,950
Did Indy ever get his job back?

2905
03:04:54,010 --> 03:04:54,290
Yeah!

2906
03:04:54,450 --> 03:04:55,430
We have so many...

2907
03:04:55,430 --> 03:04:57,410
I feel like there has to be a...

2908
03:04:59,310 --> 03:05:00,910
Post credits scene, right?

2909
03:05:01,990 --> 03:05:03,590
How many Among Us did I get?

2910
03:05:05,010 --> 03:05:05,910
50 of them.

2911
03:05:05,950 --> 03:05:06,690
That's insane.

2912
03:05:08,050 --> 03:05:08,990
And it has a planned DLC.

2913
03:05:10,570 --> 03:05:12,770
Great Circle was the last boss track.

2914
03:05:13,070 --> 03:05:13,650
So true.

2915
03:05:15,650 --> 03:05:16,690
Fantastic movie.

2916
03:05:17,470 --> 03:05:18,590
Thanks for sharing it with us.

2917
03:05:18,830 --> 03:05:21,950
Cannot believe they actually made a good licensed game in current year.

2918
03:05:22,590 --> 03:05:23,530
True, right?

2919
03:05:25,850 --> 03:05:28,690
It feels so true to the original.

2920
03:05:29,810 --> 03:05:31,170
Which is nice.

2921
03:05:31,690 --> 03:05:32,930
Troy Baker!

2922
03:05:34,750 --> 03:05:37,970
He did such a great job as Indiana Jones.

2923
03:05:38,370 --> 03:05:42,770
He sounded more like Harrison Ford than Harrison Ford sometimes.

2924
03:05:43,870 --> 03:05:44,930
It was too good.

2925
03:05:45,370 --> 03:05:46,790
It was too good of an impression.

2926
03:05:47,730 --> 03:05:48,490
Like insane.

2927
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:57,780
Tony Todd?

2928
03:05:58,300 --> 03:06:00,520
Who did he voice?

2929
03:06:00,820 --> 03:06:01,260
Did people say?

2930
03:06:01,460 --> 03:06:02,260
Did he pass away?

2931
03:06:03,720 --> 03:06:04,440
I'll look him up.

2932
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:04,840
Hold on.

2933
03:06:07,380 --> 03:06:11,420
Oh, Locus!

2934
03:06:22,770 --> 03:06:25,470
Was this one of his last works then?

2935
03:06:25,510 --> 03:06:25,950
I wonder.

2936
03:06:28,670 --> 03:06:31,690
He passed away right before the game countdown.

2937
03:06:35,690 --> 03:06:37,330
Second to last.

2938
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:47,200
Everyone did so amazing though.

2939
03:06:48,580 --> 03:06:52,620
The game is scuffed though to where it's not a problem.

2940
03:06:53,060 --> 03:06:53,540
It's funny.

2941
03:06:55,820 --> 03:06:56,620
But...

2942
03:06:58,040 --> 03:07:00,240
Now that you won, you can get Vos' Mogas.

2943
03:07:00,340 --> 03:07:00,780
Right!

2944
03:07:02,380 --> 03:07:04,860
We weren't able to get that.

2945
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:07,520
That was there.

2946
03:07:09,520 --> 03:07:10,440
It's funny scuffed.

2947
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:13,980
Overall, I did really enjoy the game.

2948
03:07:14,180 --> 03:07:15,880
Like I said, I think it was...

2949
03:07:15,880 --> 03:07:19,560
I'm so shocked at how much is packed into this game.

2950
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:20,360
Truly.

2951
03:07:21,520 --> 03:07:22,560
So much.

2952
03:07:24,500 --> 03:07:25,620
Well done, Indiana!

2953
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:29,700
If you ever want to play the older Indiana Jones games, they're all on Steam and pretty good.

2954
03:07:30,120 --> 03:07:31,440
I heard they're not very good though.

2955
03:07:32,420 --> 03:07:34,480
I heard the Lego ones weren't bad.

2956
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:37,160
Hope you'll try playing Tomb Raider after this.

2957
03:07:38,040 --> 03:07:40,540
Oh, I hate Tomb Raider controls, RedWolf.

2958
03:07:41,260 --> 03:07:44,780
Like classic Tomb Raider controls are so...

2959
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:49,800
I tried playing the demo and it's so bad.

2960
03:07:50,420 --> 03:07:51,560
The Lego games are fun.

2961
03:07:52,420 --> 03:07:52,860
No,

2962
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,280
the new ones?

2963
03:07:59,280 --> 03:08:00,100
How about Uncharted?

2964
03:08:00,300 --> 03:08:01,620
I have Uncharted.

2965
03:08:02,560 --> 03:08:05,120
I got gifted Uncharted, so...

2966
03:08:06,280 --> 03:08:08,300
I have already talked about wanting to play that.

2967
03:08:09,340 --> 03:08:11,320
Eventually, yeah, I would like to play it.

2968
03:08:21,070 --> 03:08:25,790
I know this is kind of unrelated too, but I also really want to play Red Dead Redemption.

2969
03:08:28,850 --> 03:08:30,890
There has to be a post-credits scene.

2970
03:08:31,270 --> 03:08:31,650
I swear.

2971
03:08:34,030 --> 03:08:34,810
So many games.

2972
03:08:36,030 --> 03:08:37,430
So many games I want to play.

2973
03:08:38,750 --> 03:08:41,470
But we have time, so it's all good.

2974
03:08:41,970 --> 03:08:43,910
It's got whips and cowboy hats, I know.

2975
03:08:44,790 --> 03:08:47,270
Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is good.

2976
03:08:50,430 --> 03:08:52,530
It's a long game, I know.

2977
03:08:52,910 --> 03:08:53,650
That's okay though.

2978
03:08:54,390 --> 03:08:55,850
I've done long games before.

2979
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:05,960
Can't wait for MGS4.

2980
03:09:06,420 --> 03:09:07,260
Me too.

2981
03:09:08,180 --> 03:09:11,380
I love how the ending of this is very MGS4.

2982
03:09:13,460 --> 03:09:14,860
Indy was my childhood hero.

2983
03:09:16,080 --> 03:09:18,280
This game was so faithful to the source material.

2984
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:19,880
Thanks for taking us on this adventure.

2985
03:09:20,480 --> 03:09:21,940
I'm glad you guys liked it.

2986
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:27,260
It's funny, I only watched Indiana Jones for the first time in recent years.

2987
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:32,580
So, my love for Indiana Jones is very fresh.

2988
03:09:34,200 --> 03:09:35,120
It's very fresh.

2989
03:09:35,280 --> 03:09:36,940
It's very like...

2990
03:09:37,580 --> 03:09:39,440
So cool.

2991
03:09:42,780 --> 03:09:43,860
Like Metal Gear.

2992
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:44,460
Exactly!

2993
03:09:45,560 --> 03:09:46,520
Would you recommend this game?

2994
03:09:46,980 --> 03:09:47,760
I think so.

2995
03:09:48,560 --> 03:09:50,920
I think this game has...

2996
03:09:51,660 --> 03:09:54,180
And also it has many ways you can play it.

2997
03:09:54,300 --> 03:09:55,680
Like you can go full stealth.

2998
03:09:56,060 --> 03:09:57,740
Or you can go full action.

2999
03:10:00,620 --> 03:10:05,480
It's kind of... I think it has a great play style.

3000
03:10:05,840 --> 03:10:11,600
I would say the NPC are just dumb enough for it.

3001
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:13,620
Not frustrating.

3002
03:10:13,620 --> 03:10:17,620
You know, it's like they're...

3003
03:10:17,620 --> 03:10:19,620
It's not gonna be like so...

3004
03:10:22,040 --> 03:10:23,000
So like...

3005
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,460
Oh my god, I have to do this over and over and over again.

3006
03:10:25,540 --> 03:10:28,900
And it's so horrible because this and that.

3007
03:10:29,320 --> 03:10:31,540
Like they're just dumb enough where it's like...

3008
03:10:31,540 --> 03:10:33,280
Okay, I can get through this.

3009
03:10:38,520 --> 03:10:40,160
I love the fist fights.

3010
03:10:40,340 --> 03:10:41,540
Yeah, they're fun.

3011
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:43,700
So fun, so fun.

3012
03:10:44,460 --> 03:10:46,300
Why are you guys saying Persona 5?

3013
03:10:55,970 --> 03:10:59,130
There has to be something post-credits, but these are the longest credits ever.

3014
03:11:00,010 --> 03:11:00,790
It's like waiting...

3015
03:11:00,790 --> 03:11:04,710
So I watched Transformers 1 again last night.

3016
03:11:05,010 --> 03:11:06,470
Just because I felt like it.

3017
03:11:06,930 --> 03:11:09,870
And my favorite scene in the whole movie is...

3018
03:11:10,530 --> 03:11:14,990
Or rather, not my favorite scene, but probably my favorite visuals in the whole movie are the post-credits scenes.

3019
03:11:14,990 --> 03:11:17,670
But the credits are so long.

3020
03:11:18,110 --> 03:11:20,120
And then you have to listen to that song and it's just like...

3021
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:21,710
I'm feeling good.

3022
03:11:22,470 --> 03:11:23,050
Optimus.

3023
03:11:23,830 --> 03:11:24,570
Something something.

3024
03:11:25,230 --> 03:11:25,810
Megatron.

3025
03:11:30,830 --> 03:11:32,830
Credits are 36 minutes long?

3026
03:11:34,490 --> 03:11:35,270
Wait, actually?

3027
03:11:36,670 --> 03:11:38,030
No, you guys are...

3028
03:11:41,890 --> 03:11:43,150
You can skip the credits?

3029
03:11:44,410 --> 03:11:44,970
Yippee!

3030
03:11:46,590 --> 03:11:48,170
Thanks to everyone who worked on the game.

3031
03:12:04,330 --> 03:12:04,890
Oh,

3032
03:12:11,190 --> 03:12:11,470
sorry.

3033
03:12:13,070 --> 03:12:15,310
Wait, but like...

3034
03:12:16,050 --> 03:12:17,430
What about our job?

3035
03:12:21,910 --> 03:12:24,370
How many Among Us do I have?

3036
03:12:33,210 --> 03:12:34,790
Among Us...

3037
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:43,540
Is it then a puzzle even?

3038
03:12:49,040 --> 03:12:50,400
And then it's a puzzle?

3039
03:12:51,140 --> 03:12:52,280
No way.

3040
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:52,360
No way.

3041
03:12:56,760 --> 03:12:57,960
Oh my...

3042
03:12:57,960 --> 03:13:00,260
Oh my god.

3043
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:01,880
Oh, I get it though.

3044
03:13:02,820 --> 03:13:04,720
Wait, maybe I don't get it.

3045
03:13:04,780 --> 03:13:05,940
I thought that everything...

3046
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:11,300
If you stuck one in, all the ones to the side would come out.

3047
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:13,260
But this one stopped here.

3048
03:13:13,800 --> 03:13:14,780
And stopped here.

3049
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:21,220
I don't even know how many Among Us I have.

3050
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:24,380
Wait, so if I go back to give losses...

3051
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:26,540
Are they still there?

3052
03:13:27,180 --> 03:13:28,620
I see the vision.

3053
03:13:31,300 --> 03:13:33,560
Are all the baddies gone?

3054
03:13:38,210 --> 03:13:38,890
No.

3055
03:13:42,530 --> 03:13:43,210
No.

3056
03:13:43,970 --> 03:13:45,690
It's not all empty now.

3057
03:13:47,030 --> 03:13:49,750
Took me over 40 minutes by the way.

3058
03:13:49,890 --> 03:13:50,930
Oh my god.

3059
03:13:52,710 --> 03:13:53,230
Uh...

3060
03:13:53,890 --> 03:13:56,070
What if they know that I killed their boss?

3061
03:13:57,610 --> 03:13:58,010
Oh.

3062
03:14:00,130 --> 03:14:01,330
I'm walking on through.

3063
03:14:06,750 --> 03:14:08,570
Everybody is still down though.

3064
03:14:08,610 --> 03:14:09,350
That's kind of insane.

3065
03:14:10,950 --> 03:14:14,930
No, they don't care that I killed their boss.

3066
03:14:16,750 --> 03:14:18,290
You don't wonder what that was.

3067
03:14:18,570 --> 03:14:19,390
You don't care.

3068
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:23,010
You don't care.

3069
03:14:25,310 --> 03:14:28,450
I think once you beat them, they won't respawn.

3070
03:14:28,530 --> 03:14:29,690
I think that's the case too.

3071
03:14:31,190 --> 03:14:32,850
Which is very nice.

3072
03:14:37,910 --> 03:14:39,350
Who is seeing me?

3073
03:14:39,550 --> 03:14:41,290
Through the wall?

3074
03:14:41,730 --> 03:14:42,370
Excuse me?

3075
03:14:42,910 --> 03:14:43,670
Hawkeye vision?

3076
03:14:44,050 --> 03:14:44,590
Over here?

3077
03:14:45,570 --> 03:14:46,550
The Ark is back.

3078
03:14:47,310 --> 03:14:49,030
It's like we never did anything.

3079
03:14:50,910 --> 03:14:52,690
That guy is new.

3080
03:14:54,890 --> 03:14:56,490
Definitely did not see him before.

3081
03:14:58,130 --> 03:14:59,490
You are not climbing up here, are you?

3082
03:15:01,950 --> 03:15:02,830
Hammer time.

3083
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:05,010
I beat the game, so why not?

3084
03:15:10,990 --> 03:15:13,290
Everybody in the camp has been alerted.

3085
03:15:16,710 --> 03:15:17,230
Hi.

3086
03:15:22,340 --> 03:15:23,940
Oh, come on.

3087
03:15:28,140 --> 03:15:29,020
Shovel.

3088
03:15:44,360 --> 03:15:46,660
Hey, this isn't funny.

3089
03:15:47,380 --> 03:15:48,240
Yeah, this isn't funny.

3090
03:15:48,240 --> 03:15:50,200
Da da da!

3091
03:15:59,170 --> 03:16:00,710
I got it.

3092
03:16:07,130 --> 03:16:09,410
I don't know if that counted.

3093
03:16:12,530 --> 03:16:14,370
Anyway, let's...

3094
03:16:15,930 --> 03:16:17,790
Let's quit the game.

3095
03:16:17,790 --> 03:16:17,990
Yeah.

3096
03:16:21,090 --> 03:16:26,470
I want to see that post-game puzzle sequence.

3097
03:16:27,030 --> 03:16:28,570
Give me a second to switch.

3098
03:16:28,690 --> 03:16:31,530
My monitors might get all funky with this.

3099
03:16:31,690 --> 03:16:33,770
Just a second, because I have to switch my display.

3100
03:16:35,210 --> 03:16:36,290
Give me a second.

3101
03:16:37,010 --> 03:16:37,950
Please don't get funky.

3102
03:16:38,150 --> 03:16:39,390
It's going to get funky!

3103
03:16:46,310 --> 03:16:48,410
It got less funky than I thought.

3104
03:16:48,410 --> 03:16:49,750
That's great.

3105
03:16:52,750 --> 03:16:53,410
Yippee!

3106
03:16:53,590 --> 03:16:54,650
Okay, hold on, one second.

3107
03:16:55,490 --> 03:16:56,650
One second, everybody.

3108
03:16:57,630 --> 03:17:01,410
One moment, and then we shall watch that post-game...

3109
03:17:02,090 --> 03:17:04,430
Together, post-game...

3110
03:17:04,430 --> 03:17:05,310
Content.

3111
03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:13,900
Okay, what am I searching?

3112
03:17:14,100 --> 03:17:16,600
Oh, Indiana Jones Great Circle.

3113
03:17:17,720 --> 03:17:19,040
Secret ending.

3114
03:17:21,520 --> 03:17:24,920
I have to find one of a person that's not talking.

3115
03:17:25,100 --> 03:17:27,880
So, I'm going to turn off the volume real quick for you guys.

3116
03:17:28,020 --> 03:17:29,500
This one's only 51 seconds.

3117
03:17:31,960 --> 03:17:34,560
I'm going to do...

3118
03:17:34,560 --> 03:17:37,940
Oh, I think these ones show how the puzzle works.

3119
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:39,660
So, hold on.

3120
03:17:40,540 --> 03:17:41,800
If we want to see that.

3121
03:17:43,040 --> 03:17:44,060
No, I think I'm okay.

3122
03:17:44,180 --> 03:17:46,560
Here, we'll start it at like...

3123
03:17:46,560 --> 03:17:47,960
Partially through the puzzle.

3124
03:17:49,480 --> 03:17:51,280
Okay, hold on, hold on.

3125
03:17:52,200 --> 03:17:53,860
One moment, please.

3126
03:17:55,880 --> 03:17:57,320
Let me...

3127
03:17:57,320 --> 03:17:58,080
Window capture.

3128
03:17:59,380 --> 03:18:01,680
And capture Indiana Jones.

3129
03:18:02,600 --> 03:18:04,160
And let me...

3130
03:18:04,960 --> 03:18:06,940
Let me make it small.

3131
03:18:07,280 --> 03:18:08,040
Oh, wait.

3132
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:10,720
Small, small, small, small.

3133
03:18:11,720 --> 03:18:13,120
Small, small, small.

3134
03:18:17,960 --> 03:18:18,700
Wait a second.

3135
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:20,040
Why is it doing that?

3136
03:18:20,180 --> 03:18:20,620
That's weird.

3137
03:18:22,260 --> 03:18:23,460
That should be good.

3138
03:18:29,640 --> 03:18:30,500
That should work.

3139
03:18:30,900 --> 03:18:32,000
This is... Oh, hold on.

3140
03:18:32,080 --> 03:18:32,840
Let me get the top.

3141
03:18:35,280 --> 03:18:37,480
This is from...

3142
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:39,220
YouTube channel Wicked.

3143
03:18:39,800 --> 03:18:41,160
So, thanks Wicked.

3144
03:18:41,400 --> 03:18:42,500
They solved the whole puzzle.

3145
03:18:42,900 --> 03:18:45,740
So, we're just going to watch the end of the puzzle and then I guess the...

3146
03:18:45,740 --> 03:18:47,920
The secret cutscene.

3147
03:18:48,800 --> 03:18:49,960
Oh, hold on.

3148
03:18:51,540 --> 03:18:53,040
I'm going to shut this off.

3149
03:18:53,120 --> 03:18:53,700
There we go.

3150
03:18:56,320 --> 03:18:57,440
And do...

3151
03:18:57,440 --> 03:18:58,100
This.

3152
03:19:01,860 --> 03:19:02,760
Perfect timing.

3153
03:19:02,900 --> 03:19:04,220
Wow, I just skipped to that part.

3154
03:19:25,060 --> 03:19:27,820
The Amogus were so powerful.

3155
03:19:27,980 --> 03:19:28,980
We didn't even know.

3156
03:19:28,980 --> 03:19:30,440
Oh my gosh.

3157
03:19:30,740 --> 03:19:32,060
It's the real Great Circle.

3158
03:19:32,400 --> 03:19:32,640
Maybe.

3159
03:19:35,620 --> 03:19:38,280
It went to...

3160
03:19:38,280 --> 03:19:41,860
It also went to the Himalayas?

3161
03:19:43,320 --> 03:19:44,520
Are those footsteps?

3162
03:19:49,240 --> 03:19:49,960
Is that it?

3163
03:19:56,210 --> 03:19:57,190
Locus lives?

3164
03:20:01,130 --> 03:20:02,590
Sounds like Harry Potter.

3165
03:20:03,850 --> 03:20:05,330
Locus is alive!

3166
03:20:07,550 --> 03:20:08,090
Okay.

3167
03:20:09,490 --> 03:20:10,030
Fascinating.

3168
03:20:11,390 --> 03:20:12,750
Well guys, we did it!

3169
03:20:18,430 --> 03:20:18,970
I'm...

3170
03:20:18,970 --> 03:20:20,750
Yay, he can go back.

3171
03:20:20,930 --> 03:20:22,870
What does he do from now on?

3172
03:20:24,270 --> 03:20:25,650
What do you do from here?

3173
03:20:25,710 --> 03:20:30,490
I guess maybe he will go hide the little stones again.

3174
03:20:31,370 --> 03:20:33,350
Maybe he will go hide the stones.

3175
03:20:34,670 --> 03:20:37,090
That's what he does with his life.

3176
03:20:39,170 --> 03:20:42,070
I wonder what the DLC will be like too.

3177
03:20:43,050 --> 03:20:44,670
That was fun!

3178
03:20:45,470 --> 03:20:49,850
Thank you guys for this grand Indie adventure.

3179
03:20:50,050 --> 03:20:50,670
Wait, let me see.

3180
03:20:50,730 --> 03:20:51,650
He's looking at me.

3181
03:20:53,510 --> 03:20:54,430
Hi Indie!

3182
03:20:55,010 --> 03:20:57,070
He's like, why do you have my whip?

3183
03:20:57,070 --> 03:20:58,070
Hi!

3184
03:20:59,050 --> 03:21:00,870
Hi Indiana Jones!

3185
03:21:01,850 --> 03:21:02,490
Wait, hold on.

3186
03:21:02,610 --> 03:21:04,070
I can make this a little more immersive.

3187
03:21:05,090 --> 03:21:07,110
Let's change the lighting a little bit.

3188
03:21:07,810 --> 03:21:10,470
One second.

3189
03:21:10,710 --> 03:21:11,190
Let's see.

3190
03:21:13,990 --> 03:21:15,350
No, not pink.

3191
03:21:23,970 --> 03:21:24,570
Wait.

3192
03:21:24,570 --> 03:21:24,650
Wait.

3193
03:21:27,070 --> 03:21:27,590
This.

3194
03:21:30,350 --> 03:21:31,310
There we go.

3195
03:21:31,830 --> 03:21:32,830
Indiana Jones!

3196
03:21:35,050 --> 03:21:36,150
Maybe a little darker.

3197
03:21:38,530 --> 03:21:41,170
Indiana Jones, look at me.

3198
03:21:44,810 --> 03:21:52,310
I'm going to go fight those guys and I'm going to go get the Among Us and then we're going to go to the Himalayas.

3199
03:21:52,310 --> 03:21:55,410
Did he have like a...

3200
03:21:55,990 --> 03:21:57,610
Oh, I'm standing on this guy!

3201
03:21:58,950 --> 03:21:59,350
Sorry.

3202
03:22:00,630 --> 03:22:01,870
Here, I'll stand back here.

3203
03:22:04,310 --> 03:22:07,190
Now it looks like we're about to have a...

3204
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:09,310
Like some sort of...

3205
03:22:10,930 --> 03:22:14,750
We're about to have a battle.

3206
03:22:15,230 --> 03:22:15,630
Boo!

3207
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:25,860
Yeah, we're going to have a fist fight.

3208
03:22:26,220 --> 03:22:27,500
My fists are already up.

3209
03:22:28,180 --> 03:22:28,580
Boo!

3210
03:22:29,320 --> 03:22:31,000
Yeah, come at me, Indiana Jones!

3211
03:22:31,320 --> 03:22:31,780
Come at me!

3212
03:22:32,960 --> 03:22:34,460
I stole your whole look!

3213
03:22:34,660 --> 03:22:35,440
I stole your whip!

3214
03:22:35,700 --> 03:22:36,560
I stole your hat!

3215
03:22:36,840 --> 03:22:38,120
Yeah, you want to come at me?

3216
03:22:38,300 --> 03:22:40,500
Look, I'm going to make my hat much bigger than yours.

3217
03:22:43,360 --> 03:22:45,420
What do you think about that, Indiana Jones?

3218
03:22:47,360 --> 03:22:47,580
Yeah!

3219
03:22:53,360 --> 03:22:55,140
Indiana Jones, what do you think about that?

3220
03:22:57,560 --> 03:22:59,780
The legendary 30-gallon hat.

3221
03:23:00,460 --> 03:23:03,480
This hat ain't big enough for the two of us.

3222
03:23:04,380 --> 03:23:06,480
Well guys, yeah, I do know karate!

3223
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:11,800
This is so much fun!

3224
03:23:12,060 --> 03:23:14,020
I'm glad that we could go on this adventure together.

3225
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:19,020
I thought I had much more of the game left to do, so...

3226
03:23:20,120 --> 03:23:24,190
I started so early because I was like, OK, we're going to go so long!

3227
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:27,820
But it ended up not being that much longer, so that's great.

3228
03:23:28,200 --> 03:23:29,640
Now I can go eat some dinner!

3229
03:23:32,600 --> 03:23:34,020
Thank you guys!

3230
03:23:35,980 --> 03:23:36,400
Karaage?

3231
03:23:37,460 --> 03:23:40,840
Yeah, I'm going to have some... No, I don't have any karaage, unfortunately.

3232
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:42,500
I don't know what to have for dinner.

3233
03:23:45,200 --> 03:23:46,260
I don't know.

3234
03:23:46,720 --> 03:23:47,280
Anyway!

3235
03:23:50,100 --> 03:23:50,660
Otsumita!

3236
03:23:51,820 --> 03:23:53,520
Bone apple teeth, thank you.

3237
03:23:54,120 --> 03:23:55,100
I'll see you guys later.

3238
03:24:00,240 --> 03:24:00,800
Bye!

3239
03:24:03,740 --> 03:24:04,300
Itadakimasu!

3240
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:05,140
Bye bye!

3241
03:24:05,180 --> 03:24:06,940
I'm going to go handle Indiana Jones now.

3242
03:24:07,020 --> 03:24:07,840
I'm going to take him down.

3243
03:24:08,260 --> 03:24:09,320
Bye bye!
