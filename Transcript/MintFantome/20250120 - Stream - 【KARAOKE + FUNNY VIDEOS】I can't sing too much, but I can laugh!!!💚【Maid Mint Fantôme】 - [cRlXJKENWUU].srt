1
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,200
Oh.

2
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,660
There it is.

3
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,240
Yes.

4
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,740
Welcome back, Master!

5
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,500
Hello, hello, hello!

6
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,620
One second.

7
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,120
One second, I forgot.

8
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I forgot to...

9
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,900
One second.

10
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,460
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

11
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,200
Welcome back.

12
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,500
Me?

13
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,160
Me?

14
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,220
Where did I go?

15
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,550
Help you a lot soon?

16
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,350
Thank you!

17
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,210
I think I'm like... I think I sound so much better.

18
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,250
Right?

19
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,150
I still just have...

20
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,190
Little cough.

21
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,610
Lapu!

22
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,030
Thanks for the gifted!

23
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,250
Happy Membu baby.

24
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,350
Ducky, thanks for the 5 gifted!

25
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,550
I hope your voice is feeling better.

26
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,310
I think so.

27
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,230
No, I'm not gonna say...

28
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,150
I'm not gonna say...

29
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,850
Jaguar.

30
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,750
Jaguar.

31
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:18,990
Jaguar.

32
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,150
Ducky, thanks for the 5...

33
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,050
Jaguar.

34
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,710
Jaguar.

35
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,730
Jaguar.

36
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,090
There we go.

37
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,270
I forgot to put it on repeat.

38
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,450
I forgot to download all my... I'm on my new computer, right?

39
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,830
I forgot to download all my programs.

40
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,210
I don't have the VLC.

41
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,430
I don't have Fubar.

42
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,450
I feel so...

43
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,630
I feel so naked.

44
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,010
I'm using all the Windows thingies.

45
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,310
Abichongus, welcome to Membu ship!

46
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,930
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

47
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,830
Thank you so much!

48
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,690
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

49
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,090
Thank you.

50
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,350
Teacup and NyanNyan, thanks for the 5 gifted!

51
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,010
Shady, welcome to Membu ship.

52
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,170
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

53
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,370
Thanks for the super chat.

54
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,650
TikTok was gone and it came back.

55
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,230
Seiya and Rio, Playable and VA.

56
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,770
What a crazy 24 hours.

57
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,770
I know!

58
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,370
I was in mid-saving my TikToks...

59
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,450
That I wanted to save for today's stream.

60
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,650
Because I have maybe like 2000 favorites.

61
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,490
And it's like a mix.

62
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,850
It's not like I could just download all of them and be like...

63
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,250
Okay guys, we're just gonna watch everything.

64
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,690
No, it's like...

65
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,750
I say 2000, I honestly don't know how much it is at all.

66
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,730
How many there are.

67
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,730
But it's like a mix, so it'll be like...

68
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,510
Some are recipes, some are travel things.

69
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,870
Some are funny videos.

70
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,710
So I can't just be like...

71
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,250
I couldn't just be like, okay, I'm gonna download all of them.

72
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,970
And then we just watch them all.

73
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,890
No, I wanted to download the funnies.

74
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,230
I wanted to download the funnies.

75
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,670
So I downloaded...

76
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,230
There's a few that are like...

77
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,690
That are like...

78
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,270
I thought they were interesting.

79
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,970
So I wanted to share them.

80
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,070
Hope you're feeling better.

81
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,710
Thank you!

82
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,410
Thank you, thank you.

83
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,970
April Roman, thanks for the 10 gifted!

84
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,530
Best foodbar user.

85
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,870
Hi Mint, hope you're doing better.

86
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,930
It was my birthday yesterday!

87
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,210
Shia, happy birthday!

88
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,670
Happy birthday to you.

89
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,330
Happy birthday to you.

90
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,930
Happy birthday dear Shia.

91
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,710
Happy birthday to you.

92
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,170
Nicholas, thanks for the super chat.

93
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,770
I hope you feel better.

94
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,150
About the influenza.

95
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,630
Sometimes I get the influenza.

96
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,290
It's not great.

97
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,770
It's not great.

98
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,010
Um...

99
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,610
It's my birthday!

100
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,570
Churro, happy birthday!

101
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,390
I think TikTok is back though, is it not?

102
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,350
I just... I didn't download anything else.

103
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,410
I just saved what I have.

104
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,290
And I was like, you know what?

105
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,070
Today...

106
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,810
It's enough, I think.

107
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,170
Happy birthday to you.

108
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,150
Happy birthday to you.

109
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,650
Happy birthday dear Churro.

110
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,210
Happy birthday to...

111
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,730
Who are you?

112
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,850
I went to the zoo yesterday, but no jaguars.

113
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,030
Jaguar.

114
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,610
What's weird about the way I say that?

115
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,030
I swear.

116
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,350
You guys are going to be my...

117
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,410
Well, I was going to say my 13th reason, but...

118
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,310
I'm already dead!

119
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,150
13th reason to...

120
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,570
What would a ghost do?

121
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,230
Extradead.

122
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,170
Yeah, X, ascend.

123
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,670
I don't know, go into the light.

124
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,950
Smashboo, thanks for the 5 gifted.

126
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,830
Oh my gosh, your profile picture is so cute.

127
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,330
Pedro, welcome back.

128
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,050
It's been a month since you yelled at me to quit smoking, and I haven't touched a cigarette since.

129
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,010
Thank you for the inspiration, keep being great.

130
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,650
Oh my gosh, maple flower.

131
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,590
Am I an influencer?

132
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,810
Am I like...

133
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,870
Am I like an influencer?

134
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,410
Wake up, vlog.

135
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,650
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

136
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,250
Because I am still like...

137
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,970
Wanting my voice to get a bit better.

138
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,570
I was like, well, I still want to do karaoke today, but...

139
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,890
I also really wanted to watch my videos.

140
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,270
I don't plan on becoming a react channel, but...

141
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,310
Sometimes it is just fun to show off videos that you like, you know?

142
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,410
I could...

143
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,610
It's not the same as like posting a thread on Twitter or anything, you know?

144
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,530
A thread of all of them.

145
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,630
Sometimes I just want to...

146
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,270
Be like, guys, look at this funny video.

147
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,410
And we do watch them sometimes on the stream.

148
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,330
Thank you so much for the gifted.

149
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,370
Yeah, we can react on the occasion.

150
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,370
Sorry for...

151
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,270
What is a react Andy?

152
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,490
No, I'm Mint.

153
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,230
What is react Andy?

154
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,930
Wait, that's not my name.

155
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,910
React Minty.

156
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,850
That's better.

157
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,480
It's a funny way to say streamer who reacts a lot.

158
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,040
Don't we?

159
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,420
Aren't we all reacting?

160
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,880
It's a Jerma joke.

161
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,800
His name is Andy.

162
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,480
I thought I was Jerma.

163
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,900
Aren't we all just reacting though?

164
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,100
When I play a game, am I not reacting?

165
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,840
Am I not reacting to everything that happens in the afterlife?

166
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,400
Isn't just life and afterlife just reacting to the things that happen around us?

167
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,840
Perhaps we are all react Andys and we just are not fully aware...

168
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,600
Of our status.

169
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,200
At our core, we are all Andys.

170
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,200
Darkwraith, welcome to the membership.

171
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,660
Hello Mint, Mintominky.

172
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,060
First off, I hope you feel better.

173
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,960
Although it is already over halfway through January, I was hoping to get some words of encouragement for 2025.

174
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,980
Something to help me and others lock in this year.

175
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,400
I wish I could get those too.

176
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,120
I feel like I need to lock in more.

177
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
You know...

178
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,940
Hmm...

179
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,970
Hmm...

180
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,910
I feel that...

181
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:46,160
I feel that sometimes maybe words of encouragement can maybe put a pressure on.

182
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,040
So I would say that, you know...

183
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:59,820
If you are able to go forward a little bit and do things a little bit...

184
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,060
Even at your own pace, that is...

185
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,540
You know?

186
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,220
That is all that you need to do.

187
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,960
So...

188
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,880
I think you can...

189
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,280
Not have...

190
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
So much...

191
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,280
Fret.

192
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,820
And...

193
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,660
You got this!

194
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,280
Why?

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,700
Don't worry about it.

196
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm not good at...

197
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,300
I'm not good at the motivationals, okay?

198
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,600
Encouragement, we all need it.

199
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,220
My favorite elf died on my birthday week last year, so...

200
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,540
Could I maybe get a mature minto happy birthday?

201
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,900
With extra helping of parasocial Delulu, please.

202
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,920
I'm sorry for your...

203
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,300
For your dead elf.

204
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
Elf on the shelf?

205
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,060
What did you touch the elf on the shelf?

206
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,840
And then you...

207
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,200
Don't have it anymore?

208
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,860
Something like that.

209
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,120
Darkray, thanks for the 5 gifted!

210
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,860
Appreciate the words of wisdom.

211
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,620
Welcome to membership.

212
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,120
I suppose I can try...

213
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,200
Mature minto happy birthday.

214
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,740
I suppose.

215
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,750
I need to drink water.

216
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,490
My voice just got done from being so...

217
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,460
My voice just got done with being so...

218
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,680
So...

219
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,180
You know?

220
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,280
Let the gremlin out.

221
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,530
My voice was already... It was so...

222
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,980
Gross.

223
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,440
Wait a second!

224
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,940
Try?

225
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,780
Were you not the one that I told you to delete that photo and then you didn't?

226
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,920
And you want a special happy birthday when I told you to delete that photo?

227
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,680
That I deleted and then you didn't delete it?

228
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,660
And I said delete it and then you did it?

229
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,200
And then you pinned it to your profile picture.

230
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,860
You pinned it to your profile.

231
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,260
But you want an extra special happy birthday?

232
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,120
I see.

233
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,930
Caught in 4K.

234
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,190
Sometimes I don't think that Minto sees, but I see.

235
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,070
My eyes are big enough.

236
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,710
No comment.

237
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,170
BRB gotta delete something unrelated.

238
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,740
Kanen!

239
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,120
Welcome to membership.

240
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,200
Thank you!

241
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,600
Sing for me, Minto?

242
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,460
Oh my gosh.

243
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:53,920
Okay.

244
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,000
We do need to sing though.

245
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,340
We have videos and we have karaoke.

246
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,200
I will sing you a happy birthday.

247
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,740
Happy birthday to you.

248
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,900
Happy birthday to you.

249
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,720
Happy birthday dear Choi.

250
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,120
Happy birthday to you.

251
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,120
Happy birthday!

252
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,480
Nerdy Laundry, thank you for the 5 gifted!

253
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,780
I'm not sick enough.

254
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm not cruel enough to deprive someone of their birthday song.

255
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,700
No matter how burned I feel.

256
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,460
Can we get chocolate rain in the karaoke?

257
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,700
You know what I discovered with Kerafun?

258
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,160
I discovered this.

259
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,680
I think on my old computer, Kerafun was not updated.

260
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,800
And I redownloaded it on this computer.

261
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,320
And it has a QR code.

262
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,320
It has a QR code that if you guys were to scan it, you could add things to my queue.

263
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,700
So I think not today.

264
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,440
Not today obviously because it's not going to be a full karaoke.

265
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,080
But maybe sometime in the future.

266
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,200
It could be fun.

267
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,400
And then maybe I will get songs that I don't usually get.

268
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
Do you trust us like that?

269
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,000
No.

270
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,180
But if I don't know a song, I can always skip it.

271
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,140
Remix!

272
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,120
Welcome to membership.

273
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,800
Thank you.

274
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,680
Maybe do like a...

275
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,580
What's the word?

276
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Other members or something.

277
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,000
4000 snake eaters.

278
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,440
Is there a snake eater around here?

279
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,720
Snake eater.

280
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,500
No way!

281
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,720
I'm not used to the new Kerafun layout.

282
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,960
It all is different to me.

283
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,640
Is this real?

284
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,500
Karaoke night with Minky.

285
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,340
Oh no, but that will be so much fun.

286
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,440
Let me see.

287
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,800
Hold on, I'm going to test it.

288
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,660
What's this one?

289
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,560
Oh my god!

290
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,920
It's a real Kerafun version!

291
00:19:48,800 --> 00:20:59,640
And I'm melting to you What a fear in my heart But you're so supreme I give my life for you And my time There'll be no one else Crime is the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream, snake in a hand Someday you'll go through the rain Someday you'll feed on a tree frog This ordeal,

292
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:17,500
the trial to survive On a day we see new life I give my life Not for honor, but for you

293
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:53,600
My time, there'll be no one else Crime is the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream, snake in a...

294
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:06,620
I'm still in a dream, snake in a...

295
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,570
What?

296
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,550
They didn't put the ending snake either.

297
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,930
They didn't put the ending sneater No!

298
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:18,990
Wow!

299
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,370
I'm so impressed Kerafine.

300
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,090
I'm so impressed!

301
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,550
Wait, if I put in Metal Gear... Metal Gear... What else comes up?

302
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,250
Metal... Metal... I don't know what the hell that is

303
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,290
There's more No way!

304
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,770
I can't tell if these are... These look like...

305
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,390
Hold on.

306
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:56,590
I'm not going to sing this But I kind of want to hear what it sounds like.

307
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,170
Oh wait!

308
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,150

313
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:26,430
Niels, thank you for the very big akatsupa Dearest Minfantome, would you make me the happiest wisp and be the one and only ghost to haunt me for the rest of my life and afterlife?

314
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:55,690
I have to take off my eye patch for that I... I mean... I would love to be the only one that haunts you Because, you know, ghosts are quite territorial actually I don't want to be sharing with another ghost So, I mean, like, if I can absorb life force while you're alive and,

315
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:12,550
like, you provide sufficient... not sacrifice, sorry Offerings, like, you know, I don't get it, I mean...

316
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,570
Snake Eater by Minta was a perfect start to today's gym session!

Why?

320
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,410
Why?

321
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,550
This is... It's like a... Well, not parasocial relationship Parasitic?

322
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:52,550
It's a bit of a parasite relationship Probably Paranormal?

323
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:05,990
No, not paranormal There's nothing normal about this No, no symbiotic, no Only parasitic, paranormal, parasocial

324
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,230
Paramedic?

I downloaded it Okay, I'm just gonna have to switch to a different font Okay

330
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,450
Not a karaoke... It is a karaoke stream!

331
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,630
What are you talking about?

332
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:21,190
It says karaoke and funny videos Okay, this song, I don't know it super duper well So if I mess up, I'll sing it again another stream Let me test the volume

333
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,710
Ah, I can't stop the loneliness.

334
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:29,210
Why can't I stop this sadness?

335
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,610
I can't stop the loneliness.

336
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,210
But the kiss smells like a lie.

337
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,730
I realized it when you hugged me.

338
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,750
It's not enough.

339
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,290
Like a storm.

340
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,510
Like a storm.

341
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,190
Friends and lovers.

342
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,760
I can't stop the loneliness.

343
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,780
I can't stop this sadness.

344
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,760
Sorry,

345
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,980
the video is kind of funny.

346
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,150
I can't stop.

347
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,320
I can't stop

348
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,960
this sadness.

349
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:23,460
I can't stop the loneliness.

350
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,580
Why can't I stop this sadness?

351
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,440
I can't stop this sadness.

352
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,160
I can't stop this sadness.

353
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,340
Oh, not 23.

354
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:10,580
Gosh, Murphy, why did you have to send such a big don't know mid-song?

355
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,400
Thank you!

356
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,900

357
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,360
Pedro?

358
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,660
Who is Pedro?

359
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,560
Pedro?

360
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,420
AI summary before the song.

362
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,740
The streamer Pedro is known for their singing ability and viewers are expressing their appreciation for Pedro's talent.

363
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,920
I'm now Pedro.

364
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,600
Pedro.

365
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,640
What's up, Pedro?

366
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Pedro!

367
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,000
Pedro!

368
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,860
Pedro!

369
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,880
Pedro!

370
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,440
Pedro!

371
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,000
Pedro!

372
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Pedro!

373
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,680
Hold on.

374
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,020
Hold on.

375
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,880
Hold on.

376
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,500
Hold on.

377
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,880
Pedro.

378
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,700
Wait.

379
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,100
I kind of did it.

380
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,660
Kind of.

381
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,640
And thank you for three months!

382
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,760
I don't actually know how this song goes.

383
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,640
You guys want to watch some funny videos?

384
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,460
Okay, hold on.

385
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,800
Let me pull it up.

386
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,420
Let me... hold on.

387
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,040
We're gonna... we're gonna...

388
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,760
Oh no, that's so loud.

389
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,540
Hold on for me.

390
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,040
Oh no.

391
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,380
Wait, where are all the videos at?

392
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:50,940
Oh, here we go.

393
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,640
This is the first one.

394
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,300
When I wanted to show.

395
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,800
We're just gonna warm up a little bit.

396
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,320
Okay, so...

397
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,660
Oh my gosh, what sucks is that my For You page, even though TikTok is back, is completely ruined.

398
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,120
I have to, like, read... find... which takes forever.

399
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,920
It takes forever to, like, reset your For You page, so...

400
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,220
Oh gosh, I have to, like, probably take a day to just do it.

401
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,640
But I don't feel like it, so I haven't touched TikTok since...

402
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,820
But that's okay.

403
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,660
I have all my funny videos right here.

404
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,820
Let me get rid of the set list, because it's like...

405
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,200
Hold on, I'm gonna move over.

406
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,240
Let's move over.

407
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,200
And...

408
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
My Oshie Pedro.

409
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,380
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro.

410
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,860
If you watch your favorites, it will fix it.

411
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,200
Really?

412
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,880
Actually?

413
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,780
Okay, this one is a very simple video.

414
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,560
Okay, guys, this one...

415
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,960
Actually, I don't even think we need sound, but...

416
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,420
Hold on, let me make sure the window capture is the correct thing.

417
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,580
I can't tell.

418
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,680
I can't tell.

419
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,580
Maybe.

420
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,940
Hold on.

421
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,120
I'm scared.

422
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,360
It doesn't even show up.

423
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,320
No!

424
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,680
Why isn't it showing up?

425
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,200
One second.

426
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,480
Why won't it show up?

427
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,900
Hold on.

428
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,380
Hold on.

429
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,600
What the heck is wrong with the OBS?

430
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,940
Oh, I think it does that on purpose?

431
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,980
Wait, I don't know.

432
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,020
Everything is weird.

433
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,720
My whole computer is weird.

434
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,220
Why are the videos not showing up now?

435
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,200
What's going on?

436
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,140
What's happening?

437
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,080
Why?

438
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,220
Maybe if I game capture?

439
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,540
I don't know.

440
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,440
Media player.

441
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,980
Does that work?

442
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,020
No, it's not showing up.

443
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,760
Guys, hold on.

444
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm sorry.

445
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,000
I set this all up pre-stream and now it's not showing up.

446
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,260
Because it hates me.

447
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,140
Why?

448
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,080
Oh, I know why.

449
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,260
I had to open it in the... what's it called?

450
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,460
Media player instead.

451
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,320
Not...

452
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,800
I remember.

453
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,780
I got it to work.

454
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,040
It hates her.

455
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,720
It does.

456
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,160
It does hate me.

457
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,860
Okay.

458
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,860
Alright.

459
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,080
Okay.

460
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,380
Wondering Taco, thank you for the 20 gifted!

461
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,840
And I think I saw people saying happy birthday.

462
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,760
MoriPlays, happy birthday!

463
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,240
Thanks so much for all the big energy you put into your streams.

464
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,400
You inspired me to reach all my goals.

465
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,140
Happy birthday!

466
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,240
Happy birthday to you.

467
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,820
Happy birthday to you.

468
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,400
Happy birthday dear MoriPlays.

469
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,260
Happy birthday to you.

470
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,400
Happy birthday!

471
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,400
Alright guys, you're gonna know immediately why...

472
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,550
Why I have chosen this video.

473
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,550
Do you see him?

474
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,210
Okay, hold on.

475
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,730
I don't think we need the sound.

476
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,950
It's just a lady talking.

477
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,990
But look at that little guy.

478
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,930
Oh my god!

479
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,190
He's so cute!

480
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,670
Lunch and a... Oh hold on.

481
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,570
Actually, I kind of like the lady's commentary.

482
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,730
He's so cute!

483
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:09,810
Oh my gosh!

484
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:09,890
Oh my gosh!

485
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,130
He's like, I hit the jackpot baby!

486
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,010
Lunch and a show.

487
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,490
I feel like that's gonna hurt him.

488
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,710
No?

489
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,410
The pineapple?

490
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,030
The pineapple is gonna eat his brain.

491
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:40,190
You know how it eats your... Supposedly has like the things that eat your tongue or whatever?

492
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,390
I feel like he's gonna have...

493
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,650
I feel like it's... He's so small, it's all gonna eat his brain.

494
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,330
It's cooked so it's not as bad.

495
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,010
I love cooked pineapple.

496
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,930
Oh my gosh!

497
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,150
I don't... I've only been to a...

498
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,990
What's it called?

499
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,870
Like the Brazilian steakhouse?

500
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,630
I've only been one time.

501
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,970
I didn't pay for it because it was like a business thing.

502
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,830
But good golly!

503
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,370
When they bring out that pineapple, I'm like...

504
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,430
Well, it only happened once.

505
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,610
You know what I mean?

506
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,630
I'm just like...

507
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,550
So good!

508
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,910
Bring me the cooked pineapple.

509
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,170
I wanna go back.

510
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,590
What's a good... Is there like a good Brazilian steakhouse franchise?

511
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,590
Maybe one that like everybody knows...

512
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,730
So that I can also try maybe and go...

513
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:34,970
Sometime.

514
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,250
Today is my brother's birthday.

515
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,590
Can you sing a happy birthday to him?

516
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,590
Not sure what to gift him.

517
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,970
Does he even... Does he even like me?

518
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,550
The Fogo de Chão!

519
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,890
Yes, I've heard of that one.

520
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,290
Fogo de Chão.

521
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,550
Chão!

522
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,650
Fogo de... Is it actually good?

523
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,750
Fogo de Chão.

524
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,670
Come to Brazil.

525
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,830
Well, speaking of a brother...

526
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,250
Hold on.

527
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,270
Hold on, you guys.

528
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,190
This is... This is not the first time I saw the brother.

529
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,430
But I saw it... I first saw clips of it on TikTok.

530
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,350
So, I learned... I started getting obsessed with it because of TikTok.

531
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,210
Hold on.

532
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,950
I have to like go through my videos.

533
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,990
I have to find it.

534
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,610
I can't stop...

535
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,020
Brazil...

536
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,660
Everything is so small in this folder.

537
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,440
Everything is so small.

538
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,760
Is this it?

539
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,480
No, this is the baby elephant.

540
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,600
This baby elephant went viral on TikTok because...

541
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
You just have to look at it and you'll know why.

542
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,760
And a baby elephant is spreading holiday cheer at the Houston Zoo.

543
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,300
Oh, Kirby!

544
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,420
Like, apparently this is how just elephants look when they're born.

545
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,340
But Kirby has seen the other side.

546
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,200
Like, my God.

547
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,540
Kirby does not look okay.

548
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,180
It's so...

549
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,920
It's so...

550
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,760
He's truly just like, I was not... I did not choose to be born into this world.

551
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,080
Yeah, he remembers everything on the inside.

552
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,120
It's like elephants, right?

553
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,980
They remember.

554
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,920
And he's just like, I know.

555
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,360
I've witnessed.

556
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
I have witnessed.

557
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,900
Yes.

558
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,840
Okay, whenever I show you, I'm going to delete so that I don't repeat things, you know?

559
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,400
Especially now that I have access, reaccess to my favorites.

560
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,760
And I also requested my favorite, like my data and everything so that I can just have it all downloaded.

561
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,360
Downloaded, yeah.

562
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,580
I love this.

563
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,320
People were like, people were like making videos.

564
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,640
Like, there was a filter I guess you could put on your face that made your eyes like all messed up and watery and gross.

565
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,720
Put me back, I'm not done.

566
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,660
And they would like, they would be like that one elephant at the zoo.

567
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,360
I can't find, oh my gosh, I don't, I'm trying to see.

568
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,560
I'm like looking at tiny little, what's it called?

569
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,700
Let me make the icons extra big.

570
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,640
I love, I love TikToks about pets.

571
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,400
You know, that's just everybody, right?

572
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,000
But I also have some other just kind of, I don't know.

573
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,520
So at one point, hold on, I think this one might be loud.

574
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,580
At one point, I liked a couple bird videos and I would just start getting videos like this.

575
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,760
I'm not quite sure why.

576
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:36,230
I don't know why, but I'm just like, look at them go.

577
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,910
Yeah, they're kind of, kind of awesome though.

578
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,370
It's like such a...

579
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,390
That guy, he has free will.

580
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,050
He doesn't follow the rest.

581
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,850
How can I get this to happen to me?

582
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,030
How can I get a bunch of birds to follow me like this?

583
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,490
But look at their legs, they're crazy.

584
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,690
Volunteer, what's volunteer?

585
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,630
I heard sacrifice earlier.

586
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,130
Calima, Calima.

587
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,750
Food, true.

588
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,750
Do we need a wisp sacrifice for Mint's voice?

589
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,490
No, scary looking dinosaurs.

590
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,550
Oh my gosh, I didn't save one.

591
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,970
But it was truly like a dinosaur.

592
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,890
There's this bird though.

593
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,390
Which everybody knows that I love this bird.

594
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,590
Shoeboos!

595
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:33,530
Look!

596
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,230
So cute, he's happy.

597
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,010
Look at them.

598
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,470
They're so beautiful.

599
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,570
I think Futaba is the one that does the bow though.

600
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,470
I don't know which one, which Shoebill this is.

601
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,530
Yeah, Shoebills are like my favorite bird too probably.

602
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,170
They're so...

603
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,830
Oh, it doesn't show what the account was, that's weird.

604
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,550
This is a Shoebill Stork...

605
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,090
28 maybe?

606
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,270
Is that the A10 Warthog noise?

607
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,170
Maybe that's why I love the A10.

608
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,050
It's just like a Shoebill.

609
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,650
I wish when I went and saw the Shoebill at the zoo, that it did this too.

610
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,830
But they were just very...

611
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,010
I wish also...

612
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:55,770
Look at that!

613
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,690
Oh my gosh!

614
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,990
What a face.

615
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,490
So beautiful.

616
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:05,650
So beautiful.

617
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,110
So Minto likes her bills really big.

618
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,090
Locked in.

619
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:20,970
I know.

620
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,930
They really do, they just lock in.

621
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,050
Okay, hold on, I have to delete some of these videos.

622
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,110
What did I show?

623
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:27,910
What did I show?

624
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,630
What did I show?

625
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,550
What did I show?

626
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,130
Can't remember.

627
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,910
Okay, let's do some karaoke!

628
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,590
What should I sing next?

629
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,530
Basically I'm gonna do...

630
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,970
Karaoke, show a couple videos.

631
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,470
Karaoke, show a couple videos.

632
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,290
Karaoke, show a couple videos.

633
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,010
Karaoke, show a couple videos.

634
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,310
Espresso.

635
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,430
Okay, actually I can do that one because I have a...

636
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,270
I have... Okay, you know what?

637
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:00,930
That's perfect.

638
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,770
Because I have two TikToks that goes with that.

639
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,930
I think I remember how this song goes.

640
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,530
I'm pretty sure.

641
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,240
Now here's...

642
00:46:27,240 --> 00:47:07,300

644
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:44,380

646
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:42,940

648
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,060
espresso

649
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,480
Sorry, my voice was starting to like give out from being so low

650
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:30,060
But actually, that's also not even the song that I was thinking of Oops Okay, I don't actually know how this next song goes It's also Sabrina Carpenter I promise, I have to...

651
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:37,580
It's because they're related, I promise Also, hot dog Since you're crazy enough to do karaoke, would you be crazy enough to sing Miku?

652
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,560
All I know is the...

653
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,160
That's all I know, though Any word about when the selected concert songs might go up?

654
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:11,620

655
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,040
I do!

656
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,540
There's a link in the description of the stream!

657
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:40,720
Thank you, thank you I'm thinking Miku, Miku, ui u I'm thinking Miku, Miku, ui u Okay, next song, hold on Sorry, again, it's Sabrina Carpenter But this is because I was thinking of this song and not Espresso But it's still okay It's still okay I'm gonna try... I don't think I really know this song very well,

658
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,780
but...

659
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,480
I don't know if I've ever sung this one before, actually Now that I think about it Have I?

660
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,820
I don't know I guess we'll see Hahaha

661
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,860
Don't Hahaha

662
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,900
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight.

663
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,600
I tell them it's just your culture, and everyone rolls their eyes.

664
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,080
Yeah, I know...

665
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,640
All I'm asking, baby...

666
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,260
Please, please, please, don't prove I'm right.

667
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:51,320
And please, please, please, don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice.

668
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,420
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another.

669
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,900
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker.

670
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,420
Please, please, please...

671
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,400
Well, I have a fun idea, baby.

672
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,240
Maybe just stay inside.

673
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,220
I know you're craving some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice.

674
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,580
We could probably move happily if no one knows that you're with me.

675
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,180
I'm just kidding, but really, really, really...

676
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:33,060
Please, please, please, don't prove I'm right.

677
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:45,140
And please, please, please, don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice.

678
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,180
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another.

679
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,700
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker.

680
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,240
Please, please, please...

681
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,020
What's this stupid tool doing in front of me?

682
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,680
I don't know this part at all.

683
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:19,920
If you don't wanna cry to my music, don't make me hate you prolifically.

684
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,640
Please, please, please...

685
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:32,880
Please...

686
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,660
It's just straight up desperate.

687
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,480
I thought in the last song she was like, I don't relate to desperation.

688
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,720
But this song comes off the entirely opposite way.

689
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,980
She's literally begging.

690
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,200
Come on, which is it, Sabrina Carpenter?

691
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,960
The begging Riz.

692
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,280
Please, please, please...

693
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,940
Act normal today.

694
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,280
And please, please, please...

695
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:12,140
Don't say anything about my armpits.

696
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,940
What's normal?

697
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:18,980
I don't know.

698
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,080
You screaming please like that reminded me of Orca.

699
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,220
What do I not know about your relationship?

700
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,960
Shattered Remnants, welcome to membership.

701
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:34,760
Thank you!

702
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,780
Minto karaoke is my espresso.

703
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:37,820
Thanks, Akira!

704
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,700
Please, Minto, my Miku fever is boiling.

705
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,540
What do I sing, Miku?

706
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,980
What do I, what do Miku?

707
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,020
Anything?

708
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,660
The world is mine.

709
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,200
I don't think I could.

710
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,780
Sorry.

711
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,060
Brain rot?

712
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,580
I'm still standing.

713
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,860
I tried saying that before, not so long ago.

714
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,940
Wait, hold on.

715
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,180
What's my songs to learn?

716
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:47,780
What was the song?

717
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,700
Burning Desire?

718
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,360
Okay,

719
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,220
I have some videos though.

720
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,010
Hold on, before we get into Miku, Miku, thinking Miku, Miku...

721
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,080
Hold on, I have some more TikTok.

722
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,940
Okay, so these are two Sabrina Carpenter.

723
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,940
I'm not even that big of a Sabrina Carpenter fan.

724
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,860
I do like her music, but...

725
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,580
These are related to Sabrina Carpenter.

726
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,160
This is how I learned the song, I think.

727
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,800
Whenever I listen to this I feel like I'm about to...

728
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:45,490
I feel like I'm about to start raising from the floor.

729
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:58,950
I would love

730
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,570
to hear you sing Magical Cure Love Shot one day.

731
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,190
Especially with all the calls in the background.

732
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:16,730
Does the composer release a version of the song with including the calls?

733
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:17,410
I wonder.

734
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:27,890
Okay, so that's one Sabrina Carpenter song or TikTok that I have saved.

735
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:29,970
But also this one.

736
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:34,770
This girl's puns are like off the charts.

737
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:48,850
It's me, Sabrina Carpentermite, telling you to please, please, please call Linda Johnson Extermination for all of your pest control needs.

738
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:54,190
Do you have a termite infestation or other bug infestation at your house?

739
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,350
Sabrina Carpentermite.

740
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:00,110
Well, Linda Johnson's working late so the bugs don't linger.

741
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,480
Please, please and other bugs.

742
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:19,100
Please, please, please to get rid of bugs just take your phone and call up Linda.

743
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,620
Linda Johnson Extermination.

744
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,500
She'll help you take care of your bug infestation.

745
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,480
Please, please, please.

746
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,420
It's the constant looking to the side of the...

747
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,900
I feel like it should have ended there.

748
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,120
Everybody call up Linda Johnson so she doesn't have to work at Pizza Hut anymore.

749
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,220
This is a Carly Leopard.

750
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,980
I don't know why it's not...

751
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,980
Sometimes when you download a TikTok it shows the credits at the end and it's not showing the...

752
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,880
Hold on, let me shrink the video just a little bit.

753
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,820
Oh no, you guys are still in the way.

754
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,440
Okay, hold on.

755
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,260
You guys need to move down a little bit.

756
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:15,940
Move down.

757
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Big head over here on the left.

758
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,280
You have too big of a head.

759
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,200
Shrink, shrink, shrink.

760
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,300
Shrink, shrink, shrink.

761
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:26,960
There we go.

762
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,560
Sorry.

763
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:33,000
You can see the TikTok handle.

764
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,700
I don't want to not credit people if I'm showing things.

765
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,300
Especially if TikTok is back now.

766
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,640
So, please.

767
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,200
She does other ones too.

768
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,560
They're so funny.

769
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,700
Because the puns are just too...

770
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,700
The puns are too on point.

771
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,320
That's me.

772
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,740
Sabrina Carpentermite is too good.

773
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,800
I love that.

774
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,680
I think I've seen a Chaperone one before too.

775
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,340
Hold on, let me delete the videos that I've been showing.

776
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,140
I can get rid of Shubill.

777
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,000
Goodbye Shubill.

778
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,860
I have to show you guys this one too.

779
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,320
This one just...

780
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,320
So this one...

781
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,540
Okay, so...

782
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,240
It's one of those random lockers where you like...

783
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,840
It has a prize in it, but she gets the one...

784
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,820
It says on it, Heaven or Hell.

785
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,160
So it's like a mystery.

786
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,380
She gets the mystery one and it says Heaven or Hell.

787
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,460
So, what do you think is going to be in it?

788
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,580
Do you think it's going to be Heavenly?

789
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,440
Or Hellish?

790
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,240
Mimi, welcome to membership!

791
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,380
Okay, I'll start from the beginning so you can...

792
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,680
7!

793
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,480
Her nails are so cute.

794
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,400
7!

795
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:19,500
7!

796
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,460
It's one of my favorite videos ever.

797
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,000
I can't get over it.

798
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,260
Look

799
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,700
at the quagsire.

800
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,660
He's so cute.

801
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,300
It's such a good video.

802
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,540
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven.

803
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,900
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven.

804
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,940
Okay, I have to show this one too.

805
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,940
Wait, I posted this one on Twitter.

806
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,840
You guys, this video literally brings me to tears.

807
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,100
Okay, I'm sorry.

808
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,920
I'm going to sound like an actual crazy person to this video.

809
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,900
I know it's...

810
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,530
What?

811
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,920
I need to watch it again.

812
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,320
I think I've watched this like 50 times.

813
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:44,560
I really love when ornaments just start dying, you know?

814
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,940
And they start sounding terrible.

815
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,400
Like the Elsas from 10 years ago.

816
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,240
They were like, let it go, let it go.

817
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,800
It sounds so...it's literally...

818
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,180
Sorry, I had to stand up.

819
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,940
Liz, hi!

820
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:20,130
Hi chat, Qtees, hope you're all doing well.

821
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:25,330
Liz, I'm showing a video of some TikToks that I like.

822
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:27,970
This one.

823
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:28,230
This one.

824
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:33,910
You

825
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,170
can't even see the Mickey on it.

826
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,670
All that effort for nothing.

827
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,990
All that torture for nothing.

828
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,670
You don't even see Mickey's face.

829
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:07,590
So cursed.

830
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,430
It's so cursed.

831
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,370
Okay, back to singing.

832
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,910
Back to singing, back to singing.

833
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:17,090
I'm normal, I'm normal, I'm normal.

834
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:22,440
I'm normal, I'm normal, I'm normal.

835
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,740
Austin, welcome to membership.

836
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,800
Thank you!

837
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,470
Okay, what should I sing?

838
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:25,890
Oh jeez.

839
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:35,010
What should I sing?

840
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,470
Let me bring you guys back too.

841
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,310
Except I don't know that song.

842
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:50,810
I'm sorry.

843
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:52,150
Okay, that's the only part I know.

844
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,930
I can't only just sing that part.

845
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:56,710
My ghost mitt is broken.

846
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,470
I'm sorry.

847
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:58,930
I'm sorry.

848
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:10,350
Let me just search Vocaloid karaoke.

849
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:11,330
I wonder what we'll get.

850
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,810
Actually, I wonder if like I...

851
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,810
In Kara-Fun if there's anything.

852
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:24,390
Oh they actually have World is Mine.

853
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:24,910
You know what?

854
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:25,710
Fine, I'll try it.

855
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:26,330
I'll try it.

856
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:37,850
Hold on.

857
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,810
Hold on.

858
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,570
My voice is all messed up.

859
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,370
After this I'll take a cough drop.

860
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:45,770
Okay.

861
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,850
Was the sound okay?

862
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:58,210
I'm the number one princess in the world.

863
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:02,490
That's how you treat me.

864
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:05,190
Right?

865
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:12,190
I'm

866
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:30,780
sorry.

867
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:31,980
I'm sorry.

868
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,220
I'm sorry.

869
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:33,820
I'm sorry.

870
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,900
I'm sorry.

871
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,360
I don't have my right hand down.

872
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,360
I'm not saying I'm selfish.

873
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:57,360
I just want you to think of me from the bottom of your heart.

874
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:07,280
Kamaite sekai de ichiban no hime-sama Kizazuite ne ne

875
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:13,850
na shiyou Dare da to

876
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,670
hometai Ima sugu ni yo!

877
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:29,950
Check 1, 2

878
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:51,310
No hanashi chanto kikiteru Chotto wa Sore to ne Sorry, it's been a long time since I've heard this song.

879
01:09:52,450 --> 01:10:21,350
Ukaemi kite Wakattara Shizuite Otote Oh, hime-sama ke Betsu ni Wagamama nante Ikitenain dakara Demo ne Sukoshi kurai Shikatte Kuretatte Ii no yo Sekai de Watashi dake no Ojiisama Shizuite Hora Hora

880
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:34,390
Otezakashite Mirai

881
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:19,240
nakamashimasu Wagamama na koto da to omowanai de Watashi ni datte yareba dekiru no Ato de Koukai suru wa yo Tozen desu Datte Watashi wa Sekai de

882
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:08,530
It's been like 10 years since I've listened to the full version of that song.

883
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:11,470
Oopsie.

884
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,450
The world is mine.

885
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,450
I remember my favorite part being the...

886
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,460
I don't think I should have sang that at all.

887
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,780
Kind of killed my voice.

888
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,540
I'm not the Ohime-sama.

889
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,360
I'm the maid.

890
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,980
Please don't spam song requests.

891
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:58,500
Thank you.

892
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,680
Please don't spam song requests.

893
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,220
Thank you.

894
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,540
I'm getting a cough drop now.

895
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,940
Do I have a...

896
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,000
Hold on.

897
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,200
Hold on.

898
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:18,700
Hold on.

899
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:19,240
Hold on.

900
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,400
I'm going through the karaoke classics part of...

901
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,680
Of...

902
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,280
Of...

903
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:34,680
You know.

904
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,100
Kara-fun.

905
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,520
Let's see.

906
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,380
I should have really just came up with a...

907
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,240
I had like a couple songs in my head that I was like, I want to sing these.

908
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,940
But then I was like, I should have come up with a full set list so I don't...

909
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:57,000
So I like know what songs I'm singing.

910
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:02,120
So I know what songs I can sing and not to not strain my voice too much.

911
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,640
Abba song.

912
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:08,140
Oh my gosh.

913
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,220
Speaking, well since...

914
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:16,120
Since Erb was here earlier, I was watching her karaoke yesterday and she was singing a bunch of Abba.

915
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:18,520
And...

916
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,000
Like she did the Does Your Mother Know.

917
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,260
There was another one that she sang and I was just like, oh!

918
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,660
Oh, I want to sing this one too.

919
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,300
It seems fun.

920
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,160
Is it Gimme Gimme Gimme?

921
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,680
Which one did she sing?

922
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,490
Hold on, let me listen to this one.

923
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:00,730
Do I know this one?

924
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:01,210
Hold on.

925
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:03,270
What

926
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:25,390
do I do with my cough drop?

927
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:29,010
Wait, hold on.

928
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,350
Maybe I don't know this song.

929
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
I don't think I know this song well enough.

930
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:54,220
Yeah, I recognize the beginning of this one.

931
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,000
I don't know it well enough, guys.

932
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,760
There was a different one that I was thinking of.

933
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,740
What is it?

934
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,640
Is it this one?

935
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,740
Hold on.

936
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,340
Go away, gimme gimme.

937
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,400
Sorry, I'll learn it though.

938
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,220
Let me write it down.

939
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,100
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

940
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:24,120
So many songs that I...

941
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,140
Like tangentially know, you know?

942
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,600
Uh oh.

943
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,280
Carefun, don't freeze.

944
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,600
Don't freeze on me.

945
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:35,580
Please.

946
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:36,640
Stupid.

947
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,780
Play the next song.

948
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,440
Maybe it's this one.

949
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:08,520
Doggo, wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me

950
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:47,150
It was just like shooting a sitting duck A little small talk, a smile And baby, I was struck I still don't know what you've done with me A grown-up woman should never fall so easily I feel a kind of fear When I don't have you near Unsatisfied, I pick up my pride I beg you,

951
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:48,170
dear

952
01:18:51,390 --> 01:19:24,990
Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your devotion Lay all your love on me Did you not have another oshi or anything?

953
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:25,510
Right?

954
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,170
I mean, like, that would be so crazy.

955
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:30,390
I've had a few little love affairs.

956
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:36,490
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce.

957
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:41,190
I used to think that was sensible.

958
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:46,530
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible.

959
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:49,550
Woah, what

960
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,180
can I do?

961
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:11,480
Don't go wasting your emotion.

962
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:18,200
Lay all your love on me.

963
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:25,620
And don't go sharing your devotion.

964
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:31,580
Lay all your love on me.

965
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,280
And me, and me!

966
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:39,980
Don't go wasting your emotion.

967
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:46,420
Lay all your love on me.

968
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:54,320
Don't go sharing your devotion.

969
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:01,020
Lay all your love on me.

970
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:08,620
Don't go wasting your emotion.

971
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,920
Lay all your love on me.

972
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,400
And me!

973
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:23,660
Yay!

974
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,520
That was...

975
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,820
I'm going to need a break.

976
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:30,940
I'm going to watch more videos.

977
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,720
That was...

978
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,960
Lay all your love on me.

979
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,140
And did I finish my cough drop?

980
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,100
I put it in my cup.

981
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:46,020
Yay!

982
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:47,260
Let's watch some videos.

983
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:54,260
Why did I eat my...

984
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:07,370
Do I have any frogs in there?

985
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,930
I had some saved, like favorited, but I don't think I saved them.

986
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,870
I'm just going to go through a couple that I think are kind of funny.

987
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,790
I parasocially hate you.

988
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:19,070
What do you mean by that?

989
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,750
Thanks for eight months though.

990
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:23,530
Let's see.

991
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:26,550
I've quoted this clip before.

992
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,910
I love quoting this.

993
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:29,510
It's so funny.

994
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:32,670
Well, I think I'm looking forward to cracking up.

995
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:35,970
I hope I can totally crack up.

996
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,150
I haven't totally cracked up in a long time.

997
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:42,050
I haven't totally cracked up in a long time.

998
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,690
I'm looking forward to cracking up.

999
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:49,310
I haven't totally cracked up in a long time.

1000
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:52,270
I'm looking forward to cracking up.

1001
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:54,510
I love that one.

1002
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:56,750
This one is pretty good too.

1003
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,550
What's great about these is that they are so short.

1004
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:00,950
So I can just be like, okay, next video.

1005
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:02,890
Okay, so we are at the market.

1006
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:05,970
Oh, Call of Duty book!

1007
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,610
A coloring book.

1008
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:11,450
Call of Duty book.

1009
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:13,630
Call of Duty book.

1010
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,690
I love the Yaoi Call of Duty coloring book.

1011
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:20,090
How do I get it?

1012
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,250
How do I get the Yaoi coloring book?

1013
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:28,170
I love the guy's reaction too.

1014
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,110
Just, woah.

1015
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:31,170
Woah.

1016
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:34,090
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

1017
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:39,350
Totally looking forward to cracking up.

1018
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,930
This one, when I got this in my feed.

1019
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:45,910
It felt like it targeted every aspect of my soul.

1020
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,270
Which is all that I am.

1021
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,170
Me opening up a Minto stream.

1022
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,950
I'm looking forward to cracking up.

1023
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:54,490
It's been a while since I've cracked up.

1024
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:57,990
The most part about cracking up TikTok is the Osmosis Jones post.

1025
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:00,110
He's wanting to crack up.

1026
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:03,650
You're gonna crack up at Osmosis Jones.

1027
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,630
But this next video, when I got it.

1028
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,230
It was like, oh my gosh, this is so for me.

1029
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,490
Because it targets Indiana Jones.

1030
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:16,170
It targets my love for animatronics at theme parks.

1031
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:18,390
I was like, this is just for me.

1032
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,510
And it targets my favorite ride.

1033
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:24,070
Which is the Indiana Jones ride at Tokyo Disney Sea.

1034
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,590
Apparently.

1035
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:44,170
I've ridden that ride so many times that I remember how it sounds like the song.

1036
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:49,650
But this is, I guess the one at California is not very well maintained.

1037
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:52,390
And so the Tokyo Disney one is actually like...

1038
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,530
He's like huffing and puffing and he's like...

1039
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:55,650
Man, that was tough.

1040
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:58,610
But this one, he's like...

1041
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:02,010
This guy is so good at imitating animatronics.

1042
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,910
They should hire him for the FNAF movie.

1043
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:07,690
And then you're just stuck there.

1044
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:08,810
Because you're...

1045
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:11,730
And you're stuck there waiting for the...

1046
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,770
For the car in front of you to go.

1047
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,160
He's so good at it.

1048
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,020
I'm gonna watch it again.

1049
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:34,430
I just realized, I think his whip is like a USB cord, right?

1050
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:35,350
It's funny.

1051
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:42,950
I love the Indiana Jones ride.

1052
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,410
Why is he...

1053
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,590
He looks like he could be in the ride.

1054
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:47,290
It's insane.

1055
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,370
It reminds me...

1056
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:53,070
Whenever I think of human animatronics though, I think of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

1057
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:54,570
More than anything.

1058
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,500
That's so good.

1059
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:03,320
Ok, this next video is another video that...

1060
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,600
Makes me cry from laughing.

1061
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,440
So it's a voicemail that this person got.

1062
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,020
I think they have it written on the screen actually what the explanation is.

1063
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,660
But it's a voicemail that this person got.

1064
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,620
And it's like an AI voice.

1065
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,620
But the AI voice is...

1066
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,760
Oh my god, it sounds like a gun is being held to their head.

1067
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,760
It's so funny.

1068
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,760
And then suddenly it turns to a different voice.

1069
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:53,960
It's like it's the fake breathing.

1070
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,520
Now she's fine.

1071
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,920
I know she's not fine.

1072
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,280
Someone help her.

1073
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,060
Help her.

1074
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,760
AI voice with anxiety.

1075
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:16,660
It's true.

1076
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,960
That sounds awesome.

1077
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,800
She's fine now.

1078
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,800
Why is she so like...

1079
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,800
It's the fake...

1080
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,110
It's the fake like...

1081
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:50,560
She actually sounds so distressed.

1082
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,940
It's kind of freaky.

1083
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,640
It's like...

1084
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,360
Why does she sound so scared?

1085
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,880
Who programmed you like that?

1086
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:58,900
Who hurt you?

1087
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,280
Who hurt your code?

1088
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,360
The beginning is so funny though.

1089
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,260
Could you please call me back?

1090
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:12,960
625531.

1091
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:19,680
This is a very urgent and time sensitive message from Relief Advisory Agency about funding your hardship account.

1092
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:25,400
You have been pre-qualified for a $31,000 hardship benefit to pay your bill.

1093
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:31,100
You have been pre-qualified for a $31,000...

1094
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,420
What I learned in voting school is...

1095
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:41,380
Someone help her.

1096
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,780
I love that video.

1097
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:43,980
It's so funny.

1098
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,280
You can see the day I saved it.

1099
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,400
It was in September 2023.

1100
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,520
Well, it's kind of hidden, but...

1101
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,000
And I think about this video still all the time.

1102
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,080
Why was I programmed to feel pain?

1103
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,100
Wait...

1104
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,360
What did you say ghost meant?

1105
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,580
I see people responding to you.

1106
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:08,220
Sorry, I missed it.

1107
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,900
I much needed karaoke after that singles mixer I attended yesterday.

1108
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,380
This one girl I saw...

1109
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,040
Wait, this one girl saw the mint keychain I bought at Otaku-san.

1110
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:22,100
Her look of disappointment told me all I needed to know.

1111
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:22,800
No!

1112
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:25,760
No!

1113
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:27,700
Seriously?

1114
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,300
I think if you're wanting someone who's into the same things as you though...

1115
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,840
Going to like a...

1116
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,020
I think you need to go to like...

1117
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:42,160
You know how some cities have like bars, but they're like nerd bars?

1118
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,700
Surely those kinds of places have to have like a speed dating thing.

1119
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,960
Or like a singles mixer kind of night.

1120
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:49,220
Right!

1121
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:51,860
Like...

1122
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:53,020
I feel like...

1123
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,300
Go to one of those instead.

1124
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,400
Dodged a bullet.

1125
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,080
For real!

1126
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:01,780
You dodged a bullet.

1127
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:02,840
100%.

1128
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,960
100%.

1129
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:05,860
She sucks.

1130
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:10,700
She's gonna get with someone and they're gonna be sad.

1131
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,840
Because she doesn't have fun hobbies.

1132
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:13,820
Maybe, I don't know.

1133
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,640
I don't know her at all.

1134
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,400
But she should not be, you know...

1135
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,920
She should not be judgmental.

1136
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,540
She should not be so judgmental.

1137
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,440
Please call me back before my code is deleted.

1138
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,860
Okay, this next video I love...

1139
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,860
When it's Christmas time because...

1140
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,100
They do...

1141
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,860
They do...

1142
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,260
What's it called?

1143
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:41,200
The Grinch!

1144
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:45,180
They do The Grinch at the Universal Parks.

1145
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:47,720
And this one just sends me because he's so funny.

1146
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,080
That means stinky.

1147
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,140
That means strong.

1148
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,280
Merry Christmas!

1149
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:03,840
Bye bye!

1150
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,340
Sayonara!

1151
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:09,380
I quote that all the time.

1152
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,280
I go...

1153
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,460
My name is The Grinch.

1154
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,880
Nice to

1155
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,620
meet you.

1156
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:24,020
My name is The Grinch.

1157
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,020
Nice to meet you.

1158
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,120
Nice to meet you.

1159
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,660
That means stinky.

1160
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,540
Very strong.

1161
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,680
That means strong.

1162
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,300
That means strong.

1163
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:33,880
Merry Christmas!

1164
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,460
Bye bye!

1165
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:35,920
Sayonara!

1166
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:36,480
Bye bye!

1167
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:36,940
Sayonara!

1168
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,120
The Grinch.

1169
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:45,680
He's actually so good at the Grinch voice.

1170
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,540
I know, right?

1171
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,460
They always get the best people.

1172
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,540
I have another Grinch one actually because the guys are just so funny.

1173
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,720
Hold on, let me get my other Grinch TikTok.

1174
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,720
Sorry, I'm almost done with my...

1175
01:31:59,160 --> 01:31:59,720
Cough drop.

1176
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,280
I'm almost done with my cough drop.

1177
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,380
Where's my other Grinch video?

1178
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,120
I have another Grinch video.

1179
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:05,840
I saved it.

1180
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,100
I'm worried some of my videos didn't save.

1181
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,340
I'm not seeing them in there.

1182
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:13,560
No, it has to be.

1183
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,680
Where's my other Grinch video?

1184
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,160
Where are you?

1185
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:20,980
Where?

1186
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:24,260
Where?

1187
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:25,800
Where?

1188
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,000
Where are you?

1189
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,820
Where are you?

1190
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,400
And I'm so sorry.

1191
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,940
Did I accidentally save it in my offline folder?

1192
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:36,040
No, okay.

1193
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,880
I don't know.

1194
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,900
Nevermind, maybe I can't find it.

1195
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,820
We'll go through these so we'll get to it eventually maybe.

1196
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:56,780
I don't know.

1197
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,060
The Grinch.

1198
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:01,900
This.

1199
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,400
My name is The Grinch.

1200
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,160
My name is Minky.

1201
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,180
Okay, for everybody who's just like...

1202
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:15,400
This is so much like brain rot girl, please.

1203
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,000
Okay, I'm going to show you a good video.

1204
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,420
This is related to everybody's interest, okay?

1205
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,160
Everybody can appreciate this.

1206
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,540
If you've never seen this video, it's so good.

1207
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:05,370
It's so cute!

1208
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:10,310
It's so cute!

1209
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:10,490
So cute, right?

1210
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:13,090
Everybody can appreciate Godzilla and Kaiju.

1211
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,730
I love the ears, how the ears go forward.

1212
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:32,280
What?

1213
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:38,470
I love that.

1214
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:40,770
See?

1215
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:41,690
Very powerful.

1216
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:42,790
Everybody can be powerful.

1217
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:44,930
Everybody.

1218
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,430
I love my Yoshi.

1219
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:48,710
What is this one called again?

1220
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:53,930
What is the Kaiju named again?

1221
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:54,510
I don't remember.

1222
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:57,510
Baragon?

1223
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:01,910
Baragon.

1224
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:06,910
So cute.

1225
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,630
Okay, I finished my cough drop.

1226
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:11,770
So...

1227
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:12,890
One more video.

1228
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:15,330
I'll do a short one.

1229
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,850
Some of these are a little bit longer and some of them are shorter.

1230
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:20,230
I have a mix.

1231
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,210
I have a mix.

1232
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:22,150
I have a mix.

1233
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:26,550
I mean, today is my birthday today.

1234
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:32,160
She is the first female suit actor by the way.

1235
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:33,080
Yes, it says it right there.

1236
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,740
Rie Ota was the first woman to play a Kaiju in the Godzilla franchise.

1237
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,620
Happy birthday to you.

1238
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,820
Happy birthday to you.

1239
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:46,000
Happy birthday, happy chungus.

1240
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,560
Happy birthday to you.

1241
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,360
Oh, I found my other...

1242
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:54,800
Okay, wait.

1243
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,760
I have two more videos.

1244
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,300
This one is related to Godzilla.

1245
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,240
Look, I kind of have like a pattern going on.

1246
01:35:59,300 --> 01:35:59,840
Isn't this great?

1247
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,100
This one is related to Godzilla.

1248
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,840
And then the last one, I found the Grinch video.

1249
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:04,180
Look at this.

1250
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:07,040
We need to buy a humidifier for the plants.

1251
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,720
Look how perfect this is.

1252
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:13,360
Look at him.

1253
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,140
He is charging up.

1254
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:14,900
He is charging up.

1255
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:20,920
It's perfect.

1256
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:22,520
Maybe it's not perfect.

1257
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,100
It's hitting that one plant really good.

1258
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,420
It's hitting that one guy really well.

1259
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,080
He will be nice and atomic.

1260
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:33,860
Radioactive.

1261
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:37,220
Yeah, the plants are getting nuked.

1262
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,520
We love that for them.

1263
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,440
They appreciate it.

1264
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,560
They are going to grow like really crazy.

1265
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,220
Okay, here is the last.

1266
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,380
Here is the Grinch one that I was going to play earlier.

1267
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,440
Can I get you to say something for my boyfriend Noah?

1268
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:50,340
He is sick right now.

1269
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,460
He is sick?

1270
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,000
Yeah.

1271
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:54,900
What's his name?

1272
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,220
Noah.

1273
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,060
Noah.

1274
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,400
Hey Noah.

1275
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:01,360
May I just take this please?

1276
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,140
I am stealing her phone.

1277
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:04,440
Great.

1278
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:05,740
She will never catch me.

1279
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,320
I want to play the Grinch at the park.

1280
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:12,640
Oh, fine.

1281
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,320
I will come back.

1282
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:14,740
Alright Noah.

1283
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,100
What's your name?

1284
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,800
I don't care what his name is.

1285
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,640
Right.

1286
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:25,940
Pretending to be sick is a fine way to avoid being seen in public with her.

1287
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:30,540
They are so good.

1288
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:32,300
The makeup is so good.

1289
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:33,820
The acting is so good.

1290
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,960
I want to play the Grinch.

1291
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,080
Do you think that they would allow me?

1292
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,240
Do you think that they would be like...

1293
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,440
Minto is totally Grinch material.

1294
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,460
Do you think that I could get hired to play the Grinch?

1295
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,320
Perhaps.

1296
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:51,820
Too short.

1297
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:53,740
Grinky.

1298
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:54,720
No.

1299
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:03,130
I want to go around.

1300
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:04,550
It's like when I was...

1301
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:06,590
It was a long time ago.

1302
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:09,470
When I was in grade school.

1303
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:13,550
I got to skip school one day because I was hired...

1304
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:14,850
Well, not hired.

1305
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:15,190
Sorry.

1306
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:18,190
I was asked by my friend.

1307
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:20,510
He...

1308
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:25,230
His mom worked as a teacher at a college.

1309
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:26,570
And...

1310
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:29,350
And...

1311
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:32,670
And...

1312
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:38,390
She was a theater teacher.

1313
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:41,550
And so she got to do a bunch of silly things.

1314
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:45,290
And I got to skip school because I got to dress up as Curious George.

1315
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:47,430
And run around the library.

1316
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:51,270
And cause mass chaos.

1317
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:54,250
And I got to do whatever I wanted because I was a literal monkey.

1318
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,050
I got to climb on tables.

1319
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,890
I got to skip school for this.

1320
01:38:58,270 --> 01:38:59,390
Green hates Christmas.

1321
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:01,110
True.

1322
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:02,830
He's kind of scaring me.

1323
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:04,230
Go away Grinch.

1324
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:06,850
Go away Grinch.

1325
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:10,530
Curious Minky.

1326
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:11,670
Yeah.

1327
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:12,810
It was so great.

1328
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:16,510
I know how to make people uncomfortable.

1329
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:17,130
Probably.

1330
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,710
It was such a great time.

1331
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:28,150
And then I banged my knee on a table really bad.

1332
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,790
And I remember it knocked the wind out of me.

1333
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:33,310
And I was like keeled over.

1334
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,590
And I was like...

1335
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:36,430
And they were like, come on Curious George.

1336
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:37,450
Come cause mischief.

1337
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:38,810
And I'm like...

1338
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:41,810
I'm like family guy Peter Griffin on the floor.

1339
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:49,270
It was my karma for being too good of a monkey.

1340
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:50,370
Probably.

1341
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:54,550
Anyway, let's sing more songs.

1342
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:59,150
Let's sing some more songs today.

1343
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:03,330
Let's sing them.

1344
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,740
The Grinch?

1345
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:15,180
No.

1346
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,600
We can't sing The Grinch.

1347
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,580
It's not Christmas anymore.

1348
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,340
It's not Christmas anymore.

1349
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:23,740
We can't.

1350
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,480
We can't.

1351
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,340
We can't.

1352
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,260
We'll do this song.

1353
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:28,560
I'm sorry.

1354
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:29,720
I was going through a...

1355
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:34,340
Folder is called the best of.

1356
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:35,520
Not folder.

1357
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:36,220
Playlist?

1358
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,160
It's on Caravan.

1359
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:39,820
Eyes on you by Faye Wong.

1360
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,220
For some time later.

1361
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,340
Or another stream.

1362
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,820
I think I can do that one.

1363
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,930
This one.

1364
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,740
Of which I'm certain.

1365
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:25,760
I've lived a life that's full.

1366
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:31,660
I've traveled each and every highway.

1367
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,000
And more, much more than this.

1368
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,280
I did it my way.

1369
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,040
Regrets.

1370
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,500
I've had a few.

1371
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,360
But then again.

1372
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,140
Too few to mention.

1373
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:03,560
I did what I had to do.

1374
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,300
And saw it through.

1375
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,120
Without exemption.

1376
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,000
I planned.

1377
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:16,460
Each charted course.

1378
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:19,020
Each careful step.

1379
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,840
Along the byway.

1380
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:28,190
Much more than this.

1381
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:34,590
I did it my way.

1382
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:38,110
Yes, there were times.

1383
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:41,270
I am sure you knew.

1384
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:44,150
When I bit off.

1385
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:47,470
More than I could chew.

1386
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:50,270
But through it all.

1387
01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:53,470
When there was doubt.

1388
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:56,650
I ate it up.

1389
01:42:57,510 --> 01:43:00,210
And spit it out.

1390
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,610
I faced it all.

1391
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:06,530
And I stood tall.

1392
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:10,410
And did it my way.

1393
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:15,390
I've loved.

1394
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:18,550
I've laughed and cried.

1395
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:21,410
I've had my fill.

1396
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:24,830
My share of losing.

1397
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:28,290
And now.

1398
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:31,470
As tears subside.

1399
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:34,710
I find it all.

1400
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:37,610
So amusing.

1401
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:40,370
To think.

1402
01:43:41,370 --> 01:43:43,670
I did all that.

1403
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:47,090
And may I say.

1404
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:50,790
Not in a shy way.

1405
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:52,990
Oh no.

1406
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:56,150
Oh no, not me.

1407
01:43:57,310 --> 01:44:03,290
I did it my way.

1408
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:06,110
For what is a ghost?

1409
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:08,950
What has he got?

1410
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:12,070
If not himself.

1411
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:15,610
Then he has not.

1412
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:19,750
To say the things.

1413
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:23,010
He truly feels.

1414
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:26,550
And not the words.

1415
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:29,530
Of one who kneels.

1416
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:31,770
The record shows.

1417
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:35,230
I took the blows.

1418
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:41,230
And did it my way.

1419
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:03,880
Yes.

1420
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:11,280
It was my way.

1421
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,640
Thank you, thank you.

1422
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:28,720
That was my way.

1423
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,740
From Frank Sinatra.

1424
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:35,680
I was worried my voice wasn't going to be able to hit those notes for a second.

1425
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,920
She's not even at full power.

1426
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:45,940
I was worried I wasn't going to hit some of those.

1427
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,760
My voice is healing.

1428
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,720
That was awesome.

1429
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,480
Thank you for the five year third.

1430
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:01,300
Got me all teared up with that one.

1431
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:04,260
I feel very connected to the lyrics.

1432
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:05,760
With that one.

1433
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:10,500
I feel very connected to the lyrics.

1434
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,040
What else can we sing?

1435
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:22,260
I still have a lot more videos I want to share, but I also have a lot more that I want to sing too.

1436
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:26,640
Thank you for the gift.

1437
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,080
Die with a smile.

1438
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,300
I guess I could try.

1439
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,920
I feel like, didn't I sing it last time?

1440
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:45,540
Trying to find more new songs.

1441
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:49,520
That's why I added a couple new ones to the set list as you can see.

1442
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,080
Let me do eyes on you.

1443
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:02,980
Hold on, let me double check this is good.

1444
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,160
Actually this one should be good.

1445
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:06,540
This one should be good.

1446
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:10,610
Hold on.

1447
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:12,290
There we go.

1448
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:15,130
Okay.

1449
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:17,750
White Houses, oh I like that song.

1450
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:18,450
Yeah, I'll do that one.

1451
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:29,680
I'm going to need to go get more water in a minute.

1452
01:47:49,030 --> 01:48:43,410
On the stage, on my own Whenever said my words Wishing they would be heard I saw you smiling at me Was it real or just my fantasy You'd always be there in the corner Of this tiny little world My last night here for you Same old songs, just once more My last night here with you Maybe yes,

1453
01:48:43,750 --> 01:49:53,550
maybe no I kind of liked it your way How you shyly placed your eyes on me Did you ever know That I had mine on you Darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never down Shall I be the one for you Who pinches you softly but sure If round is shown then I will know that you are no dreamer

1454
01:50:25,910 --> 01:51:01,430
Close as I want to be Close enough for me To feel your heart beating fast And stay there as I whisper How I loved your peaceful eyes on me Did you ever know I know that I had mine on me.

1455
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:25,410
Darling, so share with me your love if you have enough, your tears if you're holding back, your pain if that's what it is.

1456
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:26,650
Out

1457
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:46,250
in the dress and the voice, just reach me out then, you will know that you are not dreaming.

1458
01:51:47,250 --> 01:52:07,430
Darling, so there you are, with that look on your face, as if you're never hurt, as if you're never down.

1459
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:19,010
Shall I be the one for you, who pinches you softly by shore?

1460
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:30,370
If promise shown then, I will know that you are no dreamer.

1461
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:14,780
Maybe I'll...

1462
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:18,640
I don't want to push it so much, so...

1463
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:22,280
Maybe a couple more songs.

1464
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,820
We'll do a lot of videos, if that's okay.

1465
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:29,020
And then we'll do, like, it was a break, and then...

1466
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:30,200
Maybe a couple more songs.

1467
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,080
But let me do White Houses.

1468
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:41,410
Crouched on the floor when I moved in, this little bungalow with some strange new friends.

1469
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:45,080
Said, I'm too late, and I'm too thin.

1470
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:52,480
We promised each other it's till the end, now we're spending empty bottles, it's the five of us.

1471
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,020
With pretty-eyed boys, girls die to trust.

1472
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:59,060
I can't resist the day.

1473
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:02,680
No, I can't resist the day.

1474
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:10,190
When Jenny screams out and it's no pose, cause when she dances, she goes and goes.

1475
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:17,250
A beer through the nose on an inside joke, and I'm so excited, I haven't spoken.

1476
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:24,310
And she's so pretty, and she's so sure, maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her.

1477
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:30,770
The summer's all in bloom, the summer is ending soon.

1478
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:42,570
It's alright, and it's nice not to be so alone, but I hold on to secrets in white houses.

1479
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:50,930
Maybe I'm a little bit over my head, I come undone of the things he said.

1480
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:58,110
And he is so funny in his bright red shirt, we were all in love, and we all got hurt.

1481
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:04,830
I sneak into his car's cracked leather seat, the smell of gasoline in the summer heat.

1482
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:12,150
Boy, we're going way too fast, it's all too sweet to last.

1483
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:23,050
It's alright, and I put myself in his hands, but I hold on to secrets in white houses.

1484
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:33,550
Love, or something ignites in my veins, and I pray it never fades in white houses.

1485
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:41,550
My first time, hard to explain.

1486
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:48,690
Brush of blood, oh, and a little bit of pain.

1487
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:55,670
On a cloudy day, it's more common than you think.

1488
01:55:56,190 --> 01:56:02,910
He's my mistake.

1489
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,090
We're

1490
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:24,240
all faster than me, we gave each other up so easily.

1491
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:28,600
These silly little wounds will never mend.

1492
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:33,200
I feel so far from where I've been, so I'll go.

1493
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,520
And I will not be back here again.

1494
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:40,160
I'm gone as the day is fading.

1495
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:47,620
On white houses I lie, put my injuries all in the dust.

1496
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:53,520
And my heart is the five of us in white houses.

1497
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:57,960
And you, maybe you'll remember me.

1498
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:04,160
What I gave is yours to keep in white houses.

1499
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:07,780
In white houses.

1500
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:11,360
In white houses.

1501
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:34,880
Thank you.

1502
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,480
You can probably hear it, especially with that song I'm getting.

1503
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:44,300
Kind of raspy, getting a little raspy.

1504
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:48,860
Okay, I'm just gonna like, speed run.

1505
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:52,760
Maybe some songs, or not songs, some videos.

1506
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:54,720
Oh my god, hold on.

1507
01:57:56,060 --> 01:58:03,360
This next one, I saved, it's like a compilation, but I only saved it for one video, so I have to get to it.

1508
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:03,760
Okay, here.

1509
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:05,420
This one.

1510
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:07,780
Okay, oh, I found it.

1511
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:10,200
Ah, ah, ah, no, no.

1512
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:13,120
Okay, okay, okay.

1513
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,360
Alright, let's watch some funny videos.

1514
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:21,880
So this one, you guys know how much I love voice changing stuff, you know, I think it's all so silly.

1515
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:25,200
So, do you have any cat ones?

1516
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:26,620
I think I have a few.

1517
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:30,780
Actually, I have so many evil kitty ones, but I don't think I saved any of them.

1518
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,700
This one?

1519
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:33,540
Is that this one?

1520
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:34,000
You know it?

1521
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,240
Oh my gosh, I love this one.

1522
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:40,420
Okay, any questions before I go on from here?

1523
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:51,180
Great.

1524
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:54,240
I really understood that well.

1525
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:07,760
I'm guessing this is like when classes were online during the pandemic.

1526
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,200
Great.

1527
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:18,420
I have another video though that's also voice changer involved.

1528
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:25,080
This is the, I like don't know anything about dress to impress, so I don't know how people do this.

1529
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,220
But...

1530
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:28,420
Hold on.

1531
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:29,660
Oh, here it is.

1532
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:33,180
That was really pretty.

1533
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:35,140
I could've salvaged it, truthfully.

1534
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:36,820
What the fuck is that?

1535
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:43,680
Get the fuck off my screen.

1536
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,040
She's so scared.

1537
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,940
I think she hit the wrong button.

1538
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:59,080
Why is she so, the fact that she's freaking out and it's like...

1539
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:02,260
It's like, what's his name?

1540
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,080
Never gonna give you up, but...

1541
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:12,980
Who is that?

1542
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:20,040
Rick Astley, yeah, yeah.

1543
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,340
Sorry, I couldn't remember his name.

1544
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,140
It's Drake?

1545
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:29,340
Degrassi, yes, I knew that.

1546
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:30,880
I knew that.

1547
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:43,180
It's the absolute panic.

1548
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:50,040
It's the absolute panic with the stupid voice.

1549
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,620
Get the fuck off my screen.

1550
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:09,900
You can hear her saying it.

1551
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:14,260
It's like Rick Astley and she's like, get off my screen.

1552
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:20,500
Let's see, I have some more game stuff.

1553
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,620
This one is like this grandma who plays games.

1554
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,900
And it's just so...

1555
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:30,140
What's it called?

1556
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:33,000
Wait, did it share who the name of...

1557
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,760
Oh, this is from Treasured Curls.

1558
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:37,900
Here, I'm gonna get rid of you guys again so you can see the...

1559
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:39,740
This is where the user name...

1560
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:40,960
Down here.

1561
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,040
Hold on.

1562
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:47,460
How do I get out of that?

1563
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:51,000
Oh, I got it.

1564
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:54,440
There we go.

1565
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:00,700
Grandma playing... This is her playing Dead by Daylight.

1566
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,260
And it's just so weird.

1567
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:04,900
Hold on, I'm gonna move over.

1568
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,940
The music is so funny.

1569
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:20,750
She helps him.

1570
02:02:20,850 --> 02:02:21,210
And look!

1571
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:22,970
Look what he does.

1572
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:25,070
And then even the killer was just...

1573
02:02:27,370 --> 02:02:29,030
Go get him.

1574
02:02:30,570 --> 02:02:32,590
I don't think this is a real grandma.

1575
02:02:33,370 --> 02:02:34,210
I can't tell.

1576
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:39,130
Go get him.

1577
02:02:41,110 --> 02:02:42,350
You see that?

1578
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:43,890
She helps him.

1579
02:02:45,370 --> 02:02:45,970
You should leave.

1580
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:50,820
What even is that?

1581
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:52,200
This is so messed up.

1582
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:54,920
Did you see that?

1583
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:57,940
Go get him.

1584
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:01,160
But the voice sounds so much like a grandma for real.

1585
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:03,120
Total Granny TV.

1586
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:06,140
Total Granny.

1587
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:12,380
It's so funny.

1588
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:12,680
It's so funny.

1589
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,740
The guy is just like...

1590
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:14,480
Nah, I'm just gonna go.

1591
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:16,200
That was messed up.

1592
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:17,840
I have some more video game ones.

1593
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:20,940
This one is not funny, but...

1594
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:23,620
Oh my gosh, it spooks me to no end.

1595
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,240
Look at this.

1596
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:25,700
Look at this mechanic.

1597
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:34,140
The voice, everything about it makes me...

1598
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:35,340
Oh my gosh.

1599
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:37,920
It makes me crawl.

1600
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:44,140
This is the scariest part.

1601
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,200
Oh my gosh.

1602
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,760
Oh my gosh.

1603
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:52,540
The fact that it went the other direction.

1604
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:55,940
I could never.

1605
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:59,640
If there is a game that is made like this I would never play it.

1606
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,600
I think I would...

1607
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:05,300
Oh my gosh, it's so scary.

1608
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:09,600
The step sounds take me out of it.

1609
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:10,100
It's clear.

1610
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,740
Yeah, I think it's too much.

1611
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,120
But look at that.

1612
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,360
She's so fast too.

1613
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:16,540
She's so fast.

1614
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:18,700
It's like Weeping Angel almost.

1615
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:21,460
I hate that.

1616
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,140
I hate that.

1617
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:25,100
I hate that.

1618
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:25,800
Wait, hold on.

1619
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,820
I'm deleting some videos.

1620
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:30,900
Here is another video game one that I die every time.

1621
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:35,000
You got fired so you drowned your sorrows in booze.

1622
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:40,440
She had to get a part-time job working at a grocery store cash register.

1623
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:46,480
The only reason she could earn a wage at all was the manager liked how she looked in a skirt.

1624
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:50,020
You remember, right?

1625
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:53,720
Exactly 10 months back.

1626
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:58,260
You got fired so you drowned your sorrows in booze.

1627
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:00,760
Why is it so true?

1628
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:04,880
Why is it so true?

1629
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:12,000
Too real, man.

1630
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,460
I have another PT one.

1631
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:14,880
I used to get a lot of PT.

1632
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:19,420
A lot of PT TikToks.

1633
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:22,420
Hold on.

1634
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:23,760
I'm gonna play this one.

1635
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:27,140
I'm sure you guys have seen this, but I love compilations like this.

1636
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:28,260
Wait, where did it go?

1637
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:28,680
Oh, wait.

1638
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:30,020
This one you guys have probably seen.

1639
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:33,500
I feel like this one was popular enough it probably got posted on like Twitter or something.

1640
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:39,540
Putting Waluigi's skeleton inside of all the guys.

1641
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:43,480
Oh god, it just turned into a horror game.

1642
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,520
This one is jorts.

1643
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:55,240
I love how Yoshi and Birdo refuse to comply.

1644
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:59,800
They're so... They're so scary.

1645
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:00,780
Oh my god.

1646
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,520
Donkey Kong looks relatively normal.

1647
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:08,820
Bowser is okay too.

1648
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,020
Goomba is so... Oh my god.

1649
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:15,860
It's so bad.

1650
02:06:22,110 --> 02:06:25,250
Long Toad is... Look at Boo, he looks almost normal.

1651
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:26,410
He's so cute.

1652
02:06:28,270 --> 02:06:30,550
I didn't see the DK Skelly one.

1653
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:34,890
Goomba kills me though.

1654
02:06:35,050 --> 02:06:36,230
Where is Goomba?

1655
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:37,230
Where is he?

1656
02:06:40,910 --> 02:06:43,130
Why does he look like that?

1657
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:48,350
He's feeling something though.

1658
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:56,210
Oh wait, I was watching it and I forgot to search for the other video that I was gonna look for.

1659
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:57,210
No.

1660
02:06:58,370 --> 02:06:59,630
Someone asked for cats earlier?

1661
02:06:59,830 --> 02:07:00,430
Here's a cat.

1662
02:07:00,810 --> 02:07:01,450
Here's some cats.

1663
02:07:01,550 --> 02:07:03,770
I love cats that look like Adam Driver.

1664
02:07:04,330 --> 02:07:04,510
What?

1665
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:09,290
Oh my god.

1666
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:13,410
Everybody's honking.

1667
02:07:21,230 --> 02:07:21,790
What?

1668
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:24,770
They harmonize at the beginning.

1669
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:25,790
What?

1670
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:35,870
I love that.

1671
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:37,390
I love that.

1672
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:40,070
Hold on.

1673
02:07:40,170 --> 02:07:43,350
I'm trying to find the videos that I've played so that I can delete them.

1674
02:07:43,470 --> 02:07:46,130
But I'm bouncing all over the place so I'm getting confused.

1675
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:48,610
Oh this one's funny.

1676
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:51,050
I have a couple Sims ones too that I would get.

1677
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:52,350
I love the Sims.

1678
02:07:57,170 --> 02:07:58,290
Turbo Baby!

1679
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:10,530
Why didn't he leave though?

1680
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:13,070
The baby has no survival skills.

1681
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:16,550
Why?

1682
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:18,770
My cats have been summoned.

1683
02:08:18,890 --> 02:08:19,550
They think it's dinner.

1684
02:08:19,610 --> 02:08:20,010
Oh no!

1685
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:31,570
What did I just play?

1686
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:34,630
Oh there's the honkings.

1687
02:08:35,110 --> 02:08:35,730
The honks.

1688
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:37,250
Honk, honk, honk.

1689
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:38,630
Let's do this one.

1690
02:08:38,770 --> 02:08:39,230
Oh my gosh.

1691
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:47,090
This one is really satisfying to me because watch the way he slaps the pig.

1692
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:56,210
It's so satisfying.

1693
02:08:56,670 --> 02:08:58,190
It like scratches such an itch.

1694
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:00,230
It like is so...

1695
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:05,010
It's so...

1696
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:09,370
It's so satisfying to watch.

1697
02:09:13,450 --> 02:09:15,710
It's like violent ASMR.

1698
02:09:17,210 --> 02:09:18,130
I love it.

1699
02:09:18,210 --> 02:09:19,470
I'm kind of obsessed with it.

1700
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:21,870
Wait, did I save the ASMR one?

1701
02:09:22,350 --> 02:09:22,810
Hold on.

1702
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:24,270
Oh I did!

1703
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:24,890
Oh my gosh.

1704
02:09:24,970 --> 02:09:27,550
You guys, if I ever do ASMR it's going to be like this.

1705
02:09:28,610 --> 02:09:33,030
Sorry, trigger for like... Wait, if you hate... Hold on, hold on.

1706
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:35,470
If you hate sounds of people eating.

1707
02:09:35,630 --> 02:09:37,370
Here, I'm going to turn it down because I do too.

1708
02:09:37,730 --> 02:09:42,270
I don't know why I even watch this because like she started doing it and I was like, oh, that sounds horrible.

1709
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:43,070
I hate it.

1710
02:09:43,910 --> 02:09:44,610
Did you smell it?

1711
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:50,030
It's a mixture of all my other boyfriends.

1712
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:53,870
Here, eat some.

1713
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:55,290
Here, I'll take a bite for you.

1714
02:09:55,290 --> 02:09:57,170
It's so crisp in my ear.

1715
02:09:57,230 --> 02:09:58,250
I think I'm going to throw up.

1716
02:10:01,050 --> 02:10:02,090
I turned it down.

1717
02:10:02,190 --> 02:10:03,350
Sorry, I couldn't deal with it.

1718
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:04,890
It's your turn.

1719
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:09,950
Okay, I know when she chews because I watched these last night.

1720
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:11,610
Okay, here we go.

1721
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:11,990
It's over.

1722
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:13,610
You just bit my finger.

1723
02:10:17,370 --> 02:10:18,390
You did not.

1724
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:25,690
Did you just bite my finger?

1725
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:27,170
It's the cowboy.

1726
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:31,590
And I thought, I thought you were the one.

1727
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:42,480
You just bit my finger.

1728
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:44,600
I thought you were the one.

1729
02:10:48,450 --> 02:10:51,430
Oh, I was showing a video game compilation earlier.

1730
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:52,450
Or I mentioned it.

1731
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:52,990
I found it.

1732
02:10:53,090 --> 02:10:53,450
This one.

1733
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:59,660
I'm sure you've seen all of these, but they're so funny.

1734
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:03,220
I love dogs.

1735
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,440
Let's see if we can't find those mountain lions.

1736
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:23,480
This makes me want to play Oblivion.

1737
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:26,040
I'll not have anything to do with you.

1738
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:27,060
Be gone.

1739
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:28,600
This one though.

1740
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:29,880
Snow.

1741
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:31,920
We need more snow.

1742
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:33,860
Can't have enough snow.

1743
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:37,440
Indeed.

1744
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:41,240
Snow.

1745
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:43,200
Snow.

1746
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:44,740
We need more snow.

1747
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:46,640
Can't have enough snow.

1748
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:50,360
Indeed.

1749
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:56,680
I can't tell if they're glitched into that or if that's just how you find them.

1750
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:58,300
You know?

1751
02:11:58,620 --> 02:11:59,360
So good.

1752
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:00,160
Indeed.

1753
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:01,680
Such a classic.

1754
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,100
So funny.

1755
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,580
I don't like this one.

1756
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:08,460
Okay, well.

1757
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:13,460
I saved it because I felt like it was kind of like a...

1758
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:18,920
Oh, girls are bad at video games kind of TikTok.

1759
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:21,240
So I wasn't super a fan of it.

1760
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:27,940
But I come into it with the mindset of like, this is you guys watching YouTubers.

1761
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:30,380
Don't just think about playing Oblivion, please.

1762
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:33,700
I'll consider it.

1763
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:35,680
But this one, I think it's funny.

1764
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:44,140
If you come at it with the mindset of it is a VTuber, like you're watching the VTuber play.

1765
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:45,880
Okay, you're gonna love this game.

1766
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:47,280
It's really cute.

1767
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:49,280
It eases you in.

1768
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:52,520
See, this is the tutorial level and it teaches you all the controls.

1769
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:55,240
Nice.

1770
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:57,760
Here we go.

1771
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:04,900
I'm sure she'll figure this out.

1772
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:07,460
She's not figuring this out.

1773
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,500
She's still doing the same thing.

1774
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:17,300
This is how I feel when I'm playing.

1775
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,940
Change tactics, VTuber.

1776
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,360
Who's the legendary journalist?

1777
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:32,860
Who is that?

1778
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:34,120
Do you guys know this guy?

1779
02:13:48,380 --> 02:13:51,420
Why would I read the background decoration?

1780
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:55,360
This is actually VTuber simulator.

1781
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:09,440
That's not doing anything.

1782
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:12,200
Nope, that's not it.

1783
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:14,340
That was dumb.

1784
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:16,840
Not even close.

1785
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,500
Oh, why didn't we say so?

1786
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:25,440
Wow, that game was awesome.

1787
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:35,280
I was like this is too relatable.

1788
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:37,740
I think.

1789
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,520
We must yell at screen person.

1790
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,760
It just feels too relatable.

1791
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,820
I was like this isn't working, you guys.

1792
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:52,020
You have to do this.

1793
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:54,880
You have to do this, Minto, please.

1794
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:57,520
Minto, please.

1795
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:08,120
This one was great because I got Donna Burke naturally on my timeline.

1796
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:13,980
I was like Donna Burke, there she is.

1797
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:15,360
This is a non-Metal Gear.

1798
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:38,360
It's all the people.

1799
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:49,800
The train on track 5 is bound for Shinagawa and Shibuya.

1800
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:52,980
I know it's him, but he just sounds like...

1801
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:55,820
Please stand behind...

1802
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:59,440
It's like so consistent.

1803
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,720
JY-17

1804
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:16,920
They're professionals, I know.

1805
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:20,360
It's crazy, it's a voice made for announcements.

1806
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:24,320
Hers,

1807
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:29,340
I hear the least.

1808
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:31,980
When she does it in person.

1809
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:34,900
She didn't seem like she was very in the mood.

1810
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:36,960
I think like...

1811
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:40,400
I think like she's got to get in the mood, you know what I mean?

1812
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:44,420
Like the groove of it, you know, I think.

1813
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:47,540
Okay, this one, I don't know anything about sororities.

1814
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:49,820
But this is actually a horror movie.

1815
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:51,800
I'm turning down the volume way crazy.

1816
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:55,160
I don't know anything about sororities, but they're crazy.

1817
02:16:56,120 --> 02:16:56,440
Howdy.

1818
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:02,240
Howdy.

1819
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:06,820
Don't dead, open inside.

1820
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:11,420
Oh, you guys have seen this one?

1821
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:15,500
Oh

1822
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,300
my God, I can't do it anymore.

1823
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:35,760
It's this though.

1824
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:37,120
What the hell?

1825
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:39,700
Why would they think this is welcoming?

1826
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:41,640
I don't understand.

1827
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:46,600
The original is even worse?

1828
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:47,900
What do you mean the original?

1829
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,500
Is this not the original?

1830
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:52,980
I'm pretty sure this is the original.

1831
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:57,140
I'm pretty sure this is the original.

1832
02:17:58,280 --> 02:17:59,520
Okay, I don't know what this one is.

1833
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:01,280
We're just going to open it and see what happens.

1834
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:02,640
Oh yeah.

1835
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:27,380
I

1836
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:35,610
like the two giant lights on it.

1837
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:37,390
And the teeny tiny Santa hat.

1838
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:39,610
I think the tee is really...

1839
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:46,330
So this next one requires context.

1840
02:18:48,330 --> 02:18:52,270
Apparently, whatever this hockey stadium is...

1841
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:55,810
When they sing the American National Anthem...

1842
02:18:56,610 --> 02:18:58,810
All of the audience...

1843
02:18:58,810 --> 02:19:02,270
You know there's a part in the song where it goes...

1844
02:19:02,270 --> 02:19:05,870
The red lights, the red part, everybody goes red.

1845
02:19:06,210 --> 02:19:13,210
But they did not tell these little children that are singing the national anthem...

1846
02:19:13,210 --> 02:19:15,490
That they do that.

1847
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:29,330
Red!

1848
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:46,780
What did we do wrong?

1849
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:00,960
We were stunned.

1850
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:05,420
I'm scared of the silence.

1851
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:09,020
I would be so terrified.

1852
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:11,420
It sounds so violent.

1853
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:13,820
Oh,

1854
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:19,580
it's good.

1855
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:20,440
This one is cute too.

1856
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:21,220
This one is so funny.

1857
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:25,380
Oh my god, it's so loud.

1858
02:20:25,460 --> 02:20:25,600
Sorry.

1859
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:34,350
Kawaii desu ka?

1860
02:20:43,510 --> 02:20:44,350
Poor dog.

1861
02:20:44,610 --> 02:20:45,230
Can't keep up.

1862
02:20:53,010 --> 02:20:55,750
This is how I feel like you guys act with each other.

1863
02:20:58,710 --> 02:21:00,390
No, it's not scripted at all.

1864
02:21:06,630 --> 02:21:08,590
I feel like you guys would do this.

1865
02:21:11,250 --> 02:21:15,070
I feel like you guys would agree to create something like this.

1866
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:20,070
I feel like you would.

1867
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:24,700
Oh my god, okay.

1868
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:26,260
You guys, I have to show you this one.

1869
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:29,760
I almost did a watch along of this movie because of the TikTok.

1870
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:33,320
I almost did a watch along.

1871
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:46,440
I can't... I can't remember what it's called.

1872
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:48,280
Is this a dream?

1873
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:54,580
Yes,

1874
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:00,520
this dog's got pies.

1875
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:04,220
It's the dead eyes.

1876
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:05,040
Oh yeah!

1877
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:10,240
And there's...

1878
02:22:29,980 --> 02:22:32,300
Apparently, this is like... so...

1879
02:22:33,380 --> 02:22:35,720
If I remember correctly, the Air Bud movies, right?

1880
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:39,740
The Air Bud movies all went to these movies.

1881
02:22:40,060 --> 02:22:43,320
These like puppy dog superstar talent show movies.

1882
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:44,780
This is like a whole thing now.

1883
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:48,120
The Air Bud has moved on from sports.

1884
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:49,940
This is now the Pupstar Universe.

1885
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:51,340
Like...

1886
02:22:56,890 --> 02:23:00,190
The dead eye singing like...

1887
02:23:00,730 --> 02:23:06,830
You're gonna CGI its face and like its mouth, but the eyes just nothing is going on.

1888
02:23:07,210 --> 02:23:09,790
It's so horrible.

1889
02:23:11,310 --> 02:23:12,070
Pupstar.

1890
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:14,010
Yeah, Pupstar Cinematic Universe.

1891
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:16,790
Oh my god, it's so painful to watch.

1892
02:23:20,070 --> 02:23:25,550
Is this a dream?

1893
02:23:27,090 --> 02:23:30,830
You believe your dream came true?

1894
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:42,180
Damn, she's got pipes though.

1895
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:51,700
It's just the static standing.

1896
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:57,720
You got like the dog judges.

1897
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:58,820
I can't.

1898
02:23:58,840 --> 02:23:59,560
It's the eyebrows.

1899
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:02,120
It's so funny.

1900
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:03,820
I can't stand it.

1901
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,100
I can't stand it.

1902
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:13,560
Speaking of music, I would like to show everybody the inspiration...

1903
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:16,040
Between the brain rot bash.

1904
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:18,380
Well, I say inspiration, where I got the idea from.

1905
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:43,480
The banana really sold it for me, you guys.

1906
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:48,180
Here is the ball, the gas.

1907
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:00,280
This is where I got the idea from.

1908
02:25:00,340 --> 02:25:01,680
This very exact video.

1909
02:25:02,260 --> 02:25:02,840
You're welcome.

1910
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:06,900
Sorry this is cringe.

1911
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:08,180
It's supposed to be cringe.

1912
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:09,340
What are you talking about?

1913
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:10,960
It's supposed to be cringe.

1914
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:15,780
Cringe is free.

1915
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:19,600
Speaking of cringe, here is some Roblox content, but it's actually good.

1916
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:47,770
It's so good.

1917
02:25:50,110 --> 02:25:53,830
And then it's these guys, they're like all trying to do the...

1918
02:25:59,870 --> 02:26:00,730
It's me.

1919
02:26:01,910 --> 02:26:02,830
It's me.

1920
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:27,550
It's how all the people in Oz felt when she was singing that song and flying through the sky.

1921
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:31,850
They only hear the little itsy-bitsy pieces of her.

1922
02:26:32,810 --> 02:26:34,770
And she's just soaring through the sky.

1923
02:26:36,750 --> 02:26:37,950
It's so funny.

1924
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:40,330
Oh my gosh.

1925
02:26:42,870 --> 02:26:44,450
Gosh, I love this one too.

1926
02:26:45,070 --> 02:26:48,430
I kind of quote this one, but I don't think I've quoted this one on stream before.

1927
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:29,620
I feel like I have another hope core one.

1928
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,420
What did I save?

1929
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:32,180
What did I save?

1930
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:36,980
Oh, I was trying to find this one earlier.

1931
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:44,680
This is so... Oh, because of PT, that's right.

1932
02:28:10,310 --> 02:28:12,090
It goes so well.

1933
02:28:14,670 --> 02:28:16,650
Really throwing stones from her glass house.

1934
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:17,730
What do you mean?

1935
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:38,000
I need someone to sample that now.

1936
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:39,900
For like a song.

1937
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:41,340
Oh, I found it.

1938
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:42,600
I found the other hope core one.

1939
02:28:43,180 --> 02:28:44,980
I need someone to sample that though.

1940
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:45,560
For real.

1941
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:47,080
It sounds so good.

1942
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:50,480
How did she even think of this?

1943
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:50,880
I don't know.

1944
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:53,840
People's brains just work in other ways.

1945
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:56,460
In ways that I cannot fathom.

1946
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:58,280
Okay, here we go.

1947
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:20,000
He got it perfectly.

1948
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:25,320
It's so true.

1949
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:40,150
You know, he could speak multiple languages though.

1950
02:29:40,770 --> 02:29:42,790
So, he's doing better than me.

1951
02:29:43,590 --> 02:29:46,290
I've probably said something just as bad in Japanese.

1952
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:50,650
I really like this duck.

1953
02:29:50,830 --> 02:29:51,450
Where'd it go?

1954
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:52,530
Wait, there it is.

1955
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:54,870
I really like this duck.

1956
02:29:59,030 --> 02:30:01,130
I love that.

1957
02:30:04,290 --> 02:30:06,650
Do the duck walk, Curly Beth.

1958
02:30:07,430 --> 02:30:08,850
I love that.

1959
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:17,410
I love that.

1960
02:30:17,550 --> 02:30:19,090
I don't even know what this is from.

1961
02:30:19,890 --> 02:30:23,750
It's from an account called Halloween Commercials, but I don't know.

1962
02:30:24,410 --> 02:30:26,130
Do the duck walk, Curly Beth.

1963
02:30:27,290 --> 02:30:28,610
I love that.

1964
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:31,370
Oh, it's goosebumps.

1965
02:30:34,530 --> 02:30:36,430
Do the duck walk, Curly Beth.

1966
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:38,430
I love that.

1967
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:44,980
Oh, man.

1968
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:48,000
What is this one?

1969
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:49,440
Oh, I love this one.

1970
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:50,760
This is another one with ducks.

1971
02:31:00,210 --> 02:31:00,830
Why

1972
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:11,990
does the statue exist?

1973
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:13,210
Clearly.

1974
02:31:13,830 --> 02:31:15,310
No clapping, only quacking.

1975
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:16,410
No clapping.

1976
02:31:16,410 --> 02:31:19,810
Only the way that everybody starts quacking.

1977
02:31:21,530 --> 02:31:23,470
Yeah, it's better without context maybe.

1978
02:31:24,590 --> 02:31:26,670
No, it's a statue of Long Boy.

1979
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:28,190
Whoever Long Boy.

1980
02:31:28,290 --> 02:31:29,810
Yeah, memorial for Long Boy.

1981
02:31:29,870 --> 02:31:31,330
Everybody is so like...

1982
02:31:31,930 --> 02:31:33,170
Quack, quack, quack, quack.

1983
02:31:50,480 --> 02:31:52,780
I hope that Long Boy is okay.

1984
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:55,660
Well, I mean, that Long Boy lived a good life.

1985
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:56,800
That's what I mean.

1986
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,900
Oh my gosh, thank you for the hot guys.

1987
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:00,860
Thank you.

1988
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:05,260
Here's some more... Oh wait, here's another duck.

1989
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:11,920
Like I mentioned earlier, I like some goose and bird videos and then I would get stuff like this.

1990
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:35,300
Do dee do dee do dee do dee do dee do dee...

1991
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:47,780
So many good ones.

1992
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:50,900
So many good ones!

1993
02:32:50,980 --> 02:32:51,920
This one is another animal.

1994
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:53,260
I love animal videos.

1995
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:55,080
Who doesn't?

1996
02:33:00,860 --> 02:33:02,160
He remained calm.

1997
02:33:04,660 --> 02:33:06,540
So many duck bits, what are you obsessed with?

1998
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:07,320
Go away!

1999
02:33:13,820 --> 02:33:16,320
It's the lady in the background going, Oh.

2000
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:16,820
My.

2001
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:17,560
God.

2002
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:24,920
I pre-ordered my plat space for your arm crease you sold on Twitter and just wanted to send this bribe to grease the pits of... hey.

2003
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:26,940
Indy, chill out, okay?

2004
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:37,860
Doody, doody, doody, doody, brrra brrra brrra brrra brrra brrra The ini benini guy was the president of my country!

2005
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:38,920
No!

2006
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:44,720
Don't be embarrassed It made for...

2007
02:33:49,030 --> 02:33:49,730
Oh...

2008
02:34:12,370 --> 02:34:13,070
Yeah...

2009
02:34:15,690 --> 02:34:16,990
Beginning's a hard word.

2010
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:17,750
That's fine.

2011
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:20,890
Um, can you guys guess which Harry Potter movie this is from?

2012
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:25,530
I'm about to play you a scene from a Harry Potter movie, but I'm not going to tell you which one.

2013
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:26,270
I already know.

2014
02:34:26,590 --> 02:34:27,850
Yes, leave your answer in the comments.

2015
02:34:28,130 --> 02:34:29,070
The Goblet of Fire.

2016
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:32,490
Five?

2017
02:34:34,510 --> 02:34:35,230
Which one's five?

2018
02:34:35,510 --> 02:34:36,150
Which one's four?

2019
02:34:36,350 --> 02:34:37,490
Four is Goblet of Fire.

2020
02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:44,330
The Goblet of Fire.

2021
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:48,830
This one makes me laugh because...

2022
02:34:50,210 --> 02:34:52,830
I kind of want to start singing my happy birthdays like this.

2023
02:34:54,630 --> 02:34:57,370
Happy birthday to you.

2024
02:34:57,730 --> 02:35:00,450
Happy birthday to you.

2025
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:01,350
Joy, thanks for the beat!

2026
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:08,310
Happy birthday, dear Bowman, Bowman, Bowman.

2027
02:35:08,370 --> 02:35:09,370
Oh, so context?

2028
02:35:09,710 --> 02:35:18,970
Apparently this user really likes this lady, and all of their friends bought them cameo of this lady, and so they stitched them together.

2029
02:35:20,010 --> 02:35:26,590
Bowman, happy birthday to you.

2030
02:35:27,790 --> 02:35:32,830
Happy 27th birthday, Bowman, from Alice Elm with Elegant Interior Decorating.

2031
02:35:32,890 --> 02:35:35,110

02:35:38,290 --> 02:35:40,890
Alice Elm with Elegant Interior Decorating.

2034
02:35:41,230 --> 02:35:47,810
I hope that you have an amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing birthday.

2035
02:35:48,410 --> 02:35:50,670
And just a few of my decorating tips.

2036
02:35:50,910 --> 02:35:56,730
Well, first of all, I like neutral colors, but you choose whatever colors that you like.

2037
02:35:57,430 --> 02:36:06,450
But also add a beautiful area room in just about every room in your home, because it really enhances just about every room in a home.

2038
02:36:06,750 --> 02:36:11,990
And when choosing lighting, add a beautiful lighting that creates an ambience.

2039
02:36:12,350 --> 02:36:14,370
And nice decorative pillows.

2040
02:36:14,370 --> 02:36:16,190
Look, she's giving so much advice.

2041
02:36:16,570 --> 02:36:17,550
You're getting your money's worth.

2042
02:36:18,110 --> 02:36:21,030
And just a couple of fashion tips, Bowman.

2043
02:36:21,250 --> 02:36:26,650
Always dress for the occasion and wear well-fitting clothing.

2044
02:36:27,290 --> 02:36:28,190
I love you.

2045
02:36:28,350 --> 02:36:29,710
I love you, Bowman.

2046
02:36:29,730 --> 02:36:31,510
I love you, Bowman.

2047
02:36:31,630 --> 02:36:34,230
I love you, Bowman, I wish you nothing but the best.

2048
02:36:34,530 --> 02:36:38,090
Love always from Alice Elm with Elegant Interior Decorating.

2049
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:41,650
Love always from Alice Elm with Elegant Interior Decorating.

2050
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:45,130
Love always from Alice Elm with Elegant Interior Decorating.

2051
02:36:45,390 --> 02:36:49,190
Love always from Alice Elm with Elegant Interior Decorating.

2052
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:52,390
You guys, my birthday is October 1st.

2053
02:37:00,210 --> 02:37:02,210
I love you, Minto.

2054
02:37:02,430 --> 02:37:02,970
I love...

2055
02:37:02,970 --> 02:37:03,930
You can hear it now.

2056
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:15,660
Oh,

2057
02:37:20,740 --> 02:37:22,620
man, so good.

2058
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:27,420
These types of videos, actually, Matara would send them to me all the time.

2059
02:37:49,590 --> 02:37:50,970
There's so many of these.

2060
02:37:51,010 --> 02:37:51,750
They're so good.

2061
02:37:52,210 --> 02:37:55,050
I only saved one, but I had so many of them saved.

2062
02:38:00,510 --> 02:38:02,050
This might be my favorite one.

2063
02:38:31,630 --> 02:38:35,850
I want to try this with my cats, but I have to get a video of them, like...

2064
02:38:36,930 --> 02:38:37,890
I'm doing anything.

2065
02:38:38,170 --> 02:38:38,690
What's this one?

2066
02:38:38,750 --> 02:38:40,170
Oh, I love this one!

2067
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:42,090
Oh, Chico Bandito.

2068
02:38:44,990 --> 02:38:47,550
I love you so much.

2069
02:38:48,270 --> 02:38:49,250
You're just a cat.

2070
02:38:53,950 --> 02:38:54,270
Yeah.

2071
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:00,190
You're so handsome.

2072
02:39:01,010 --> 02:39:02,730
I love you so much.

2073
02:39:03,410 --> 02:39:04,470
You're just a cat.

2074
02:39:05,050 --> 02:39:05,750
Yeah.

2075
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:06,970
Yeah.

2076
02:39:10,870 --> 02:39:12,510
Oh, Chico Bandito.

2077
02:39:12,610 --> 02:39:13,130
Sorry, okay.

2078
02:39:13,330 --> 02:39:15,350
I can't stop listening to him.

2079
02:39:15,370 --> 02:39:16,590
He's just so cute.

2080
02:39:19,050 --> 02:39:20,650
Do I have any more cats?

2081
02:39:20,730 --> 02:39:22,090
Oh, I have lots more cats.

2082
02:39:22,150 --> 02:39:22,630
What's this one?

2083
02:39:23,310 --> 02:39:24,210
What is this cat video?

2084
02:39:25,390 --> 02:39:25,890
Oh, yeah.

2085
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:30,270
The music choice is so...

2086
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:33,230
Why does he do that?

2087
02:39:35,710 --> 02:39:36,190
Why?

2088
02:39:36,190 --> 02:39:42,890
Why is he like that?

2089
02:39:44,970 --> 02:39:46,350
And then this is another one.

2090
02:39:46,530 --> 02:39:47,390
Here's another cat video.

2091
02:39:48,150 --> 02:39:49,110
Sounds good.

2092
02:40:08,930 --> 02:40:09,450
Rocky.

2093
02:40:22,010 --> 02:40:23,050
Thank you.

2094
02:40:23,730 --> 02:40:24,470
Hi, I'm Fallen.

2095
02:40:24,510 --> 02:40:26,330
I'm glad you like my TikToks.

2096
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:29,770
My feed wasn't so cursed.

2097
02:40:30,130 --> 02:40:31,270
My feed is funny.

2098
02:40:32,470 --> 02:40:33,350
My feed...

2099
02:40:33,350 --> 02:40:34,310
This is kind of cursed though.

2100
02:40:34,390 --> 02:40:35,650
Here, I'll show you guys this.

2101
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:48,420
Oh god, I hate the bears.

2102
02:40:54,380 --> 02:40:56,080
Music is so funny.

2103
02:40:58,340 --> 02:40:59,540
Who is this?

2104
02:40:59,540 --> 02:41:00,540
Who is this dragon?

2105
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:02,120
Who is that?

2106
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:04,240
I've never seen that guy before in my afterlife.

2107
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:08,100
Never seen him.

2108
02:41:08,360 --> 02:41:09,960
I'll lie through the eyes of a toddler.

2109
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:12,420
This one's good in focus though.

2110
02:41:12,820 --> 02:41:13,980
It's pretty nice.

2111
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:16,300
This one is really...

2112
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:17,560
I don't think it's the photo.

2113
02:41:17,740 --> 02:41:19,820
I think it's just the way he looks.

2114
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:21,800
I think it's just him.

2115
02:41:21,960 --> 02:41:24,340
I don't think it's the figment.

2116
02:41:26,040 --> 02:41:27,000
Pete's dragon.

2117
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:29,100
Looks like Spyro.

2118
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:31,220
Spyro if he gained like 50 pounds.

2119
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:33,020
Pimpy.

2120
02:41:35,480 --> 02:41:36,080
Pimpy.

2121
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:41,320
Figment is an OG.

2122
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:42,840
I don't know him at all.

2123
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:44,340
I don't know.

2124
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:47,120
I'm a fake Disney fan, I guess.

2125
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:50,000
Here, this one's also with dragons.

2126
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:55,320
This is us before Dizzy Dragon.

2127
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:59,000
Their screaming is so...

2128
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:03,300
Their screaming is so dramatic until you see that it's warranted.

2129
02:42:06,860 --> 02:42:08,540
Dude on the right though is not happy.

2130
02:42:09,960 --> 02:42:10,340
Hi.

2131
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,440
He's going through it.

2132
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:21,240
His expression matches the shirt.

2133
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:29,060
If you ever ride a spinny ride with me though, this is exactly what you're expecting.

2134
02:42:31,220 --> 02:42:33,740
This is what you will get with me if you...

2135
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:38,340
If you ride a spinny ride like this with me.

2136
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:41,700
Man's traumatized.

2137
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,300
Wait, what's this one?

2138
02:42:45,580 --> 02:42:47,160
Oh, Fish of the Week!

2139
02:42:54,060 --> 02:42:57,660
I know what it is, but what do you think it's gonna be?

2140
02:42:58,180 --> 02:42:58,740
Hackfish.

2141
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:05,200
Yeah, giant sea bass!

2142
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:05,660
Yes!

2143
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:12,160
It isn't actually a sea bass and is part of the wreckfish family.

2144
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:18,760
But it certainly earns the giant part of its name as it gets up to 2.5 meters and 360 kilograms.

2145
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:20,560
They live in the...

2146
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:21,240
I didn't read that.

2147
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:24,280
This giant sea bass can live over 75 years.

2148
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:27,040
They live in kelp forests and are the apex predators there.

2149
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:31,300
Unfortunately, they are critically endangered and locally extinct in Southern California.

2150
02:43:35,740 --> 02:43:37,920
Fish of the Year is only three weeks away!

2151
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:40,580
Oh, I don't know what guy is Fish of the Year.

2152
02:43:54,720 --> 02:43:59,720
It's crazy because like in Animal Crossing, you get the sea bass like crazy.

2153
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:04,420
But to know that it's critically endangered is so crazy.

2154
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:05,700
Right?

2155
02:44:08,200 --> 02:44:15,340
But in Animal Crossing, it makes it seem like it's the most common fish you'll ever experience.

2156
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:17,060
The sea bass.

2157
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:21,540
This is the giant sea bass.

2158
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:22,220
Oh.

2159
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:24,160
Oh yeah, you're right.

2160
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:27,000
In Animal Crossing, it's just a sea bass.

2161
02:44:27,540 --> 02:44:27,740
Oh.

2162
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:32,200
You're so right!

2163
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:35,460
Here's a dog.

2164
02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:48,540
It's a bouncing ball that bounces on its own.

2165
02:44:53,330 --> 02:44:54,230
Hi, I'm Larry.

2166
02:44:54,470 --> 02:44:56,650
The shivery, cheerful bird.

2167
02:44:56,830 --> 02:44:57,190
I'm cold.

2168
02:44:57,390 --> 02:44:58,030
I need a sweater.

2169
02:44:58,830 --> 02:45:00,190
She's gripping it, yeah.

2170
02:45:00,830 --> 02:45:02,250
What kind of dog is that?

2171
02:45:02,310 --> 02:45:02,930
She's so pretty.

2172
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:13,870
It also isn't really bouncing on its own.

2173
02:45:14,210 --> 02:45:16,790
It's just wobbling everywhere.

2174
02:45:16,990 --> 02:45:18,130
It doesn't really bounce.

2175
02:45:19,410 --> 02:45:20,750
Faulty product, I think.

2176
02:45:21,710 --> 02:45:22,610
I like this one.

2177
02:45:22,690 --> 02:45:24,550
This one has nothing to do with animals or anything.

2178
02:45:24,770 --> 02:45:25,670
I just think it's funny.

2179
02:45:26,990 --> 02:45:28,570
The bus can't even go.

2180
02:45:29,350 --> 02:45:31,830
Oh my god, call the police.

2181
02:45:33,290 --> 02:45:36,610
Oh my god, he is the police.

2182
02:45:39,930 --> 02:45:46,470
Oh my god, oh my god, call the police.

2183
02:45:47,050 --> 02:45:50,310
Oh my god, he is the police.

2184
02:45:54,650 --> 02:45:57,190
Oh my god, call the police.

2185
02:45:58,850 --> 02:46:01,710
Oh my god, he is the police.

2186
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:06,530
The comedic timing.

2187
02:46:07,410 --> 02:46:08,230
We love that.

2188
02:46:08,310 --> 02:46:09,050
We love that.

2189
02:46:09,470 --> 02:46:11,190
Oh, I just realized.

2190
02:46:11,670 --> 02:46:13,770
I think I got shut out of TikTok before.

2191
02:46:13,950 --> 02:46:15,170
I could download...

2192
02:46:15,170 --> 02:46:20,230
Oh, I wanted to download the one of the dinosaur ride.

2193
02:46:20,770 --> 02:46:21,890
But I have this one.

2194
02:46:21,990 --> 02:46:22,730
This ride instead.

2195
02:46:24,650 --> 02:46:25,890
Okay, hold on.

2196
02:46:25,890 --> 02:46:29,110
At the end of ET, he says your name.

2197
02:46:29,430 --> 02:46:32,630
And the group of young guys in front of us all gave their name as Chuck.

2198
02:46:38,530 --> 02:46:38,930
Oh,

2199
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:47,210
TikTok is bad.

2200
02:46:47,230 --> 02:46:48,750
No, I downloaded them all last night.

2201
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:51,450
I don't... I didn't care to touch it this morning, honestly.

2202
02:46:52,650 --> 02:46:56,230
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

2203
02:46:58,190 --> 02:46:59,590
Fine, thanks for the five gifted.

2204
02:47:00,290 --> 02:47:01,030
Thank you.

2205
02:47:01,170 --> 02:47:03,130
Okay, this one also kills me.

2206
02:47:03,210 --> 02:47:05,210
Because grandma's on Facebook, just...

2207
02:47:06,350 --> 02:47:07,970
Oh, grandma's on Facebook.

2208
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:11,690
Take me to the king.

2209
02:47:12,770 --> 02:47:15,830
I don't have much to bring.

2210
02:47:17,210 --> 02:47:20,670
My heart's all in pieces.

2211
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:23,530
It's my offering.

2212
02:47:25,030 --> 02:47:27,710
Take me to the king.

2213
02:47:27,710 --> 02:47:30,070
It's like that damn pop star.

2214
02:47:30,730 --> 02:47:31,610
Stupid

2215
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:36,940
pop star video.

2216
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,020
Oh, gosh.

2217
02:47:39,900 --> 02:47:42,280
Does Mint know about Tyranno dance guys?

2218
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,200
I don't think so.

2219
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:44,260
Maybe I know of them.

2220
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:45,180
I don't know their name.

2221
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:48,140
And for me and TikTok, I don't...

2222
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:50,140
I only followed like one creator.

2223
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:55,000
Everything else, I just enjoyed the surprise of it all.

2224
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:57,420
Because I would just get the most random things.

2225
02:47:58,120 --> 02:48:00,260
Oh, I want to play this one about the wasp.

2226
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:01,540
But it's kind of gross.

2227
02:48:06,580 --> 02:48:08,140
What the heck is that one?

2228
02:48:08,140 --> 02:48:08,940
I don't remember.

2229
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I downloaded these last night and I don't remember what some of them are.

2230
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:13,760
I really like this one though.

2231
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:15,120
I like this one.

2232
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:21,600
Oh, he's so cute.

2233
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:25,700
Yeah, dig it.

2234
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:26,720
Yeah, yeah.

2235
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:28,840
Oh, he's so cute.

2236
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:41,380
Yeah, he's so cute.

2237
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:45,600
Gosh, look how precious he is.

2238
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:48,720
Oh, what a snake.

2239
02:48:49,360 --> 02:48:53,320
Oh, he's so cute.

2240
02:48:54,180 --> 02:48:55,680
Okay, I need to back away.

2241
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:58,460
Here, this one's cursed.

2242
02:48:58,720 --> 02:48:58,980
Oh, wait.

2243
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:00,320
This one's also so cute.

2244
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:02,240
I told you I like to get bird videos.

2245
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:06,240
I wish a pigeon would text me.

2246
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:11,060
Several pigeons are typing.

2247
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:12,620
Look at that.

2248
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:14,660
Look at that.

2249
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:16,140
What if he sends a bad word though?

2250
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:23,500
Oh my god, she fell asleep on the key.

2251
02:49:25,380 --> 02:49:26,380
Oh, big yawn.

2252
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:33,380
How is the pigeons cosplaying a creeper?

2253
02:49:35,080 --> 02:49:35,410
Sixteen.

2254
02:49:36,370 --> 02:49:37,170
Oh, daddy.

2255
02:49:39,730 --> 02:49:40,530
F6.

2256
02:49:44,910 --> 02:49:46,110
So cute.

2257
02:49:47,010 --> 02:49:48,850
Such a good idea.

2258
02:49:49,390 --> 02:49:56,530
What a joy to just periodically receive texts from your pigeons.

2259
02:49:57,830 --> 02:49:59,250
Such a great idea.

2260
02:49:59,370 --> 02:50:02,970
That would be such a joy through my day.

2261
02:50:02,970 --> 02:50:06,770
If I'm at work and suddenly I get a text from my pigeon, I would...

2262
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:08,890
And it's a nice keyboard.

2263
02:50:09,030 --> 02:50:10,150
I love the yawn.

2264
02:50:12,830 --> 02:50:14,630
I would not want to clean those keyboards.

2265
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:15,130
You know what?

2266
02:50:15,150 --> 02:50:15,610
So true.

2267
02:50:15,710 --> 02:50:17,810
I can't believe it looks like such a nice keyboard too.

2268
02:50:18,250 --> 02:50:20,350
Like, it's got the RGB and everything.

2269
02:50:21,570 --> 02:50:22,290
Wasp video.

2270
02:50:22,470 --> 02:50:22,770
Okay.

2271
02:50:23,270 --> 02:50:23,950
Oh my gosh.

2272
02:50:24,010 --> 02:50:25,870
Okay, so it's a wasp with a parasite.

2273
02:50:26,390 --> 02:50:27,910
And he has to get the par...

2274
02:50:27,910 --> 02:50:29,610
Stuff like this is so fascinating, right?

2275
02:50:29,870 --> 02:50:31,530
He has to get the parasite out.

2276
02:50:34,130 --> 02:50:34,490
Wait.

2277
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:37,030
Why isn't it playing?

2278
02:50:37,570 --> 02:50:38,250
Oh, I'm sorry.

2279
02:50:38,310 --> 02:50:39,150
I opened it with the wrong thing.

2280
02:50:41,990 --> 02:50:42,350
This one.

2281
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:45,150
Look.

2282
02:50:51,850 --> 02:50:52,730
Oh my god.

2283
02:50:52,750 --> 02:50:56,310
Look at him trying to sting him.

2284
02:50:56,370 --> 02:50:56,810
It's crazy.

2285
02:50:57,910 --> 02:50:58,770
Look how many there are.

2286
02:51:01,150 --> 02:51:02,090
Ew, not this.

2287
02:51:02,090 --> 02:51:03,390
You asked for this.

2288
02:51:03,450 --> 02:51:04,230
What are you talking about?

2289
02:51:04,510 --> 02:51:05,450
Play the wasp video.

2290
02:51:05,650 --> 02:51:07,210
I said the wasp video was gross.

2291
02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:08,730
Play the wasp video.

2292
02:51:09,030 --> 02:51:09,950
Okay, here it is.

2293
02:51:14,990 --> 02:51:16,610
I don't think that.

2294
02:51:23,890 --> 02:51:24,410
Nasty.

2295
02:51:25,630 --> 02:51:27,450
I wonder if it hurts though.

2296
02:51:28,470 --> 02:51:29,370
He's a fat boy.

2297
02:51:30,850 --> 02:51:31,370
Gooey.

2298
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:37,950
I don't think we should save the wasp though.

2299
02:51:38,030 --> 02:51:38,510
That guy sucks.

2300
02:51:40,410 --> 02:51:41,130
Look, he weaves.

2301
02:51:41,810 --> 02:51:42,550
Bye bye.

2302
02:51:44,350 --> 02:51:46,290
This one, he has like...

2303
02:51:47,870 --> 02:51:48,670
Look at that though.

2304
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:50,550
Like, that's...

2305
02:51:50,550 --> 02:51:52,090
This is an extreme amount.

2306
02:51:54,610 --> 02:51:56,650
Like, that's an extreme amount.

2307
02:51:56,770 --> 02:51:57,710
It looks so uncomfortable.

2308
02:51:59,230 --> 02:52:00,270
He was a friendly wasp.

2309
02:52:00,330 --> 02:52:01,290
I mean, he tried to sting.

2310
02:52:01,290 --> 02:52:03,250
But like, he's friendly too.

2311
02:52:03,590 --> 02:52:04,190
Yeah, a little bit.

2312
02:52:04,290 --> 02:52:05,870
He's just, he's just, you know, he's like...

2313
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:10,630
You're also trying to go inside my body.

2314
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:11,450
You're too big.

2315
02:52:11,510 --> 02:52:12,030
I'll die.

2316
02:52:12,770 --> 02:52:13,630
No, he wasn't.

2317
02:52:13,750 --> 02:52:15,610
He was gonna extract the things in your body.

2318
02:52:17,230 --> 02:52:22,510
More please will go to Kelvin Wiley's TikTok and you can get more, you know?

2319
02:52:24,690 --> 02:52:26,070
Also, I don't...

2320
02:52:26,810 --> 02:52:28,790
This one, it just came across my feed.

2321
02:52:29,990 --> 02:52:32,910
You're watching videos of wasps while I'm giving a stop.

2322
02:52:34,050 --> 02:52:36,110
Immediately went on to sting a family of four.

2323
02:52:36,250 --> 02:52:36,430
No!

2324
02:52:37,730 --> 02:52:40,290
This one is so crazy because...

2325
02:52:40,290 --> 02:52:41,250
I didn't...

2326
02:52:41,250 --> 02:52:43,330
I was waiting for the picture of the rat.

2327
02:52:43,950 --> 02:52:49,370
And then when I got the picture of the rat, I was not prepared for the picture of the rat.

2328
02:52:49,750 --> 02:52:50,730
Oh my god.

2329
02:52:52,270 --> 02:52:54,870
I'm about to get on r slash rat.

2330
02:52:58,790 --> 02:53:03,170
This is the first one that was being posted constantly and Perky was massive.

2331
02:53:03,590 --> 02:53:05,730
Like a massive rat.

2332
02:53:05,870 --> 02:53:10,350
Like absolutely, just like morbidly obese, huge rat.

2333
02:53:10,610 --> 02:53:10,950
Huge rat!

2334
02:53:11,430 --> 02:53:19,490
This wouldn't be promoted or allowed on a lot of like pet subreddits because the size was indicative of abuse.

2335
02:53:19,770 --> 02:53:23,150
But, Perky's owner was like, no, Perky's a rescue.

2336
02:53:23,390 --> 02:53:26,830
This is like leftover medical issues from a past owner.

2337
02:53:26,830 --> 02:53:29,230
Okay, that's totally understandable.

2338
02:53:29,990 --> 02:53:31,430
You know, you saved Perky.

2339
02:53:31,630 --> 02:53:32,330
You're helping him get better.

2340
02:53:32,470 --> 02:53:34,150
So they started doing like, Perky pose.

2341
02:53:34,290 --> 02:53:36,970
Perky was super famous on the subreddit.

2342
02:53:36,970 --> 02:53:39,190
You guys are not ready to see Perky.

2343
02:53:39,450 --> 02:53:48,310
Then, people started noticing that, for one, Perky's owner was not really telling anybody what the medical issues were and why they couldn't be fixed.

2344
02:53:48,490 --> 02:53:55,810
And also noticing that the other rats that this person had were also pretty large.

2345
02:53:55,810 --> 02:54:00,750
Except for one rat that the owner posted very recently and was like, See?

2346
02:54:01,090 --> 02:54:03,730
This rat eats the same as Perky and this rat's not fat.

2347
02:54:03,810 --> 02:54:08,230
But also, someone pointed out that apparently that rat had died five months prior.

2348
02:54:08,390 --> 02:54:15,270
So then the moms were like, we're not gonna promote Perky anymore because we think that Perky maybe is being abused.

2349
02:54:15,410 --> 02:54:25,570
And this started a huge civil war of people being super pro-Perky and being like, Fuck you, we're leaving.

2350
02:54:25,710 --> 02:54:28,390
We're gonna make our own pro-Perky rat subreddit.

2351
02:54:28,390 --> 02:54:33,970
And then other people posting and just tearing apart Perky's owner and being like, This person should have their rats taken.

2352
02:54:34,290 --> 02:54:38,930
But listen, guys, when I'm telling you this rat is massive, let me show you a photo.

2353
02:54:40,090 --> 02:54:42,210
Look at this fucking rat, dude.

2354
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:44,510
That's grotesque.

2355
02:54:44,590 --> 02:54:45,450
That is insane.

2356
02:54:45,910 --> 02:54:49,990
Like, whatever is going on here is not kosher, okay?

2357
02:54:49,990 --> 02:54:51,590
This rat needs help.

2358
02:54:51,590 --> 02:54:53,210
And this has been going on for days.

2359
02:54:53,410 --> 02:54:58,510
You can't even see his face is being engulfed by his body.

2360
02:54:58,890 --> 02:55:00,550
This poor rat!

2361
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:02,110
Perky!

2362
02:55:03,290 --> 02:55:06,830
Oh my god, he's ginormous.

2363
02:55:07,630 --> 02:55:09,970
Oh my god, Perky.

2364
02:55:11,230 --> 02:55:12,830
Someone save Perky!

2365
02:55:13,230 --> 02:55:17,150
I have never heard anything else about Perky the rat after this.

2366
02:55:17,150 --> 02:55:20,510
I don't know if Lana the Goblin ever did an update, but...

2367
02:55:21,210 --> 02:55:22,690
Good golly, that rat!

2368
02:55:24,610 --> 02:55:25,470
He's huge!

2369
02:55:27,190 --> 02:55:29,870
Oh my god!

2370
02:55:31,630 --> 02:55:33,270
That rat's huge!

2371
02:55:33,350 --> 02:55:33,890
I know!

2372
02:55:34,030 --> 02:55:35,130
Cheeseburger, happy birthday!

2373
02:55:35,650 --> 02:55:38,450
Happy birthday to you!

2374
02:55:38,790 --> 02:55:46,750
Happy birthday to you!

2375
02:55:47,090 --> 02:55:50,370
Happy birthday dear Cheeseburger!

2376
02:55:51,310 --> 02:55:53,970
Happy birthday to you!

2377
02:55:56,830 --> 02:56:00,750
I feel like Milkhouse 6000 YouTube videos are up your alley.

2378
02:56:01,470 --> 02:56:02,710
Milkhouse?

2379
02:56:03,210 --> 02:56:04,070
Like Milhouse?

2380
02:56:04,990 --> 02:56:08,130
I'm happy to find a fellow NGS fanatic.

2381
02:56:08,170 --> 02:56:09,310
Thank you for the superchat!

2382
02:56:09,470 --> 02:56:10,870
I'll definitely look up the account.

2383
02:56:12,250 --> 02:56:14,210
I love ones about awkward dogs.

2384
02:56:16,410 --> 02:56:19,190
Another awkward night with my dog of 70.

2385
02:56:19,990 --> 02:56:22,170
Why do dogs look at you like this?

2386
02:56:22,590 --> 02:56:23,890
Like you're intruding.

2387
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:34,140
He's just like...

2388
02:56:34,820 --> 02:56:37,160
The music really sells it.

2389
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:41,980
I'm going to do this video, and then we can go back to singing.

2390
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:44,440
I still have so many more videos.

2391
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:46,100
I'm going to have to do the best of the best.

2392
02:56:46,120 --> 02:56:46,460
Oh wait!

2393
02:56:46,920 --> 02:56:48,420
I have two more videos.

2394
02:56:48,980 --> 02:56:51,100
This one I actually brought up on stream.

2395
02:56:51,780 --> 02:56:53,180
And so now I can show you.

2396
02:56:53,680 --> 02:56:55,940
Because I brought it up on stream before.

2397
02:56:57,600 --> 02:56:59,700
And I talked about the...

2398
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:01,580
The jep...

2399
02:57:02,620 --> 02:57:03,500
The malore?

2400
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:06,780
Thanks for the spooky!

2401
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:08,780
Thanks for all the good vibes today.

2402
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:10,640
Both the karaoke and the silly videos.

2403
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:11,280
Yeah!

2404
02:57:13,320 --> 02:57:15,460
The malore, the one alcohol.

2405
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:19,760
But I first, if you know Red Letter Media...

2406
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:24,180
I first watched this video because the guy looks like my oshi, Mike Staclasa.

2407
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:27,500
And then I watched the content and I was just like...

2408
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:29,160
Jepson's malore!

2409
02:57:29,240 --> 02:57:29,920
Yes, thank you.

2410
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:33,680
And then I watched the video and I was like...

2411
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:34,640
Okay, this is kind of funny.

2412
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:35,640
Alright, ready?

2413
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:36,380
What is it?

2414
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:39,140
Doesn't he look so much like Mike?

2415
02:57:39,720 --> 02:57:40,540
Jepson's malore.

2416
02:57:40,780 --> 02:57:41,620
And then you take it.

2417
02:57:41,780 --> 02:57:43,180
And you say...

2418
02:57:43,180 --> 02:57:43,980
I'll have another.

2419
02:57:44,300 --> 02:57:45,660
Wait, I say that after?

2420
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:46,160
Yeah.

2421
02:57:46,760 --> 02:57:47,100
Alright, ready?

2422
02:57:47,540 --> 02:57:48,340
Who's Jepson?

2423
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:49,600
Jepson's malore.

2424
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:50,500
Here it goes.

2425
02:57:55,300 --> 02:57:56,440
I'll have another.

2426
02:57:58,140 --> 02:57:58,900
Here we go.

2427
02:57:58,980 --> 02:57:59,480
Jepson's malore.

2428
02:57:59,480 --> 02:58:00,040
I'll have another.

2429
02:58:09,020 --> 02:58:11,140
Alright, ready?

2430
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:11,860
What is it?

2431
02:58:16,560 --> 02:58:18,540
I don't know what this...

2432
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:21,860
People said it tastes like something humans should not consume.

2433
02:58:21,940 --> 02:58:25,140
But I'm a ghost, so if I tried it, would I be okay?

2434
02:58:29,220 --> 02:58:30,020
Jepson's malore.

2435
02:58:41,900 --> 02:58:42,700
Oh gosh.

2436
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:48,080
That I... One last video.

2437
02:58:48,220 --> 02:58:49,240
This one is of some giraffes.

2438
02:58:49,300 --> 02:58:50,380
Sorry, I have so many videos.

2439
02:58:51,180 --> 02:58:52,260
I love them all.

2440
02:58:52,580 --> 02:58:53,500
I love them all.

2441
02:58:53,560 --> 02:58:54,060
Look at this.

2442
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:54,920
This is majestic.

2443
02:58:56,580 --> 02:58:58,440
Sorry for giraffe balls.

2444
02:59:05,410 --> 02:59:07,170
The wide stance.

2445
02:59:16,810 --> 02:59:18,450
It's the wide stance.

2446
02:59:19,190 --> 02:59:21,270
He like wraps it around.

2447
02:59:23,990 --> 02:59:24,630
Step.

2448
02:59:25,890 --> 02:59:26,850
Step.

2449
02:59:35,130 --> 02:59:36,450
Shut up, Indy.

2450
02:59:36,530 --> 02:59:39,810
I actually almost shared one of my videos that reminded me of Haley Joel Osment.

2451
02:59:40,030 --> 02:59:41,790
But I think I would have gotten so upset.

2452
02:59:43,230 --> 02:59:46,450
I wouldn't have wanted to continue.

2453
02:59:47,390 --> 02:59:52,110
But I have videos saved of people that look like Haley Joel Osment that make me mad.

2454
02:59:54,150 --> 02:59:58,110
I could probably find it now and save it, but I don't want to...

2455
03:00:07,190 --> 03:00:09,390
Do you guys know Offlane?

2456
03:00:09,750 --> 03:00:13,630
I had to make an individual folder for Offlane.

2457
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,220
Because I love his videos.

2458
03:00:25,820 --> 03:00:28,020
The peener snipper guy.

2459
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,140
Offlane is awesome.

2460
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:36,180
That's the only account I follow on TikTok, honestly.

2461
03:00:36,440 --> 03:00:37,280
No, that's a lie.

2462
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:40,320
I follow idols and that's the only real account.

2463
03:00:43,180 --> 03:00:44,700
I'm going to go get some water.

2464
03:00:46,380 --> 03:00:49,960
I'm going to put something on for you guys to watch while I'm gone.

2465
03:00:52,360 --> 03:00:53,540
What should I put on?

2466
03:00:54,880 --> 03:00:56,800
Oh, I'm going to put on this one.

2467
03:00:56,920 --> 03:00:58,400
Okay, there's a backstory to this one.

2468
03:00:59,900 --> 03:01:05,300
When the hook to a girl first came out with her podcast, I didn't know what it was about.

2469
03:01:05,540 --> 03:01:08,380
And then I saw this video and I was like, whoa.

2470
03:01:09,160 --> 03:01:11,360
Wow, she's actually using her platform.

2471
03:01:14,600 --> 03:01:17,040
I didn't know she was like so cool.

2472
03:01:18,020 --> 03:01:21,820
And so I saw this video and I actually thought this is what the first episode...

2473
03:01:21,820 --> 03:01:24,880
I don't even know what she talks about on her podcast.

2474
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,500
But I thought this was...

2475
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:31,120
When I saw this, I thought it was real.

2476
03:01:31,420 --> 03:01:43,640
The talk to a podcast's first discussion, 16th century naval warfare, proved to be an incredibly enlightening and insightful dive into an underrated and poorly understood topic.

2477
03:01:44,060 --> 03:01:46,980
The conversation began correcting a major misconception.

2478
03:01:46,980 --> 03:01:54,500
Although sailing ships were in use by the Syrians, war-powered galleys still dominated the Mediterranean.

2479
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:59,760
The reason for this is because speed and maneuverability in shallow waters was key.

2480
03:02:00,480 --> 03:02:03,920
Naval warfare still imitated one of the works of Poseidon.

2481
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:14,300
While ships were equipped with cannons, these early models lacked the range for the fire and raw power to reliably take out enemy ships before they were inborn.

2482
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:23,860
Sailing ships, which relied on favorable winds, were especially at risk when compared to galleys, which did not need wind to maneuver well.

2483
03:02:24,300 --> 03:02:28,660
Then the podcast moved on to the actual nature of galley warfare itself.

2484
03:02:29,200 --> 03:02:38,980
They explained that like land warfare, the majority of naval conflicts in this period were not large pitched battles, but raids, skirmishes, and sieges.

2485
03:02:38,980 --> 03:02:44,980
However, when two fleets did engage, the result was often far more destructive than on land.

2486
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:56,580
When Haley questioned Whitney on why this was, she responded that the utter chaos and unpredictability made retreating in proper order next to impossible once the fighting began.

2487
03:02:56,960 --> 03:03:04,580
As ships fired volleys of missiles at point-blank range and men fought their way across decks, there was nowhere to run or hide.

2488
03:03:04,580 --> 03:03:11,640
Men who otherwise may have fled the field and survived on land had no choice but to fight or perish.

2489
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:15,020
And of course, enemy weapons weren't the only danger.

2490
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:17,980
We can finish watching.

2491
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:19,000
It's so interesting, right?

2492
03:03:24,560 --> 03:03:32,960
I used to get a lot of videos like this and a lot of videos about like executions and like royalty and stuff.

2493
03:03:34,900 --> 03:03:37,260
This is why I like TikTok, you guys!

2494
03:03:37,460 --> 03:03:38,960
I would never look this up myself!

2495
03:03:45,020 --> 03:03:55,780
Spain, Venice, and the Ottoman Empire were the preeminent naval powers of this period, and controlling the waters of the Mediterranean were imperative to their wider strategic goals.

2496
03:03:56,160 --> 03:04:06,240
As galleys had little room for food and water, frequent resupplies at ports were needed, and thus the primary focus of these powers was control of the port cities.

2497
03:04:06,240 --> 03:04:17,440
Eventually, cannon and ship technology would render galleys obsolete, and European strategic focus would shift more towards the New World as their colonial empires grew.

2498
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:30,640
Leading to the True Age of Sail we all know and love, but to the ladies of the TalkTua podcast, galley warfare is an incredibly fascinating chapter in naval history that should be appreciated more.

2499
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:33,300
The TalkTua podcast...

2500
03:04:35,240 --> 03:04:36,640
Cool!

2501
03:04:42,180 --> 03:04:45,050
Happy Birthday!

2502
03:04:45,690 --> 03:04:48,930
Happy Birthday to you!

2503
03:04:49,370 --> 03:04:51,950
Happy Birthday to you!

2504
03:04:52,290 --> 03:04:55,950
Happy Birthday dear Matt Kramer!

2505
03:04:56,830 --> 03:04:59,810
Happy Birthday to you!

2506
03:05:00,450 --> 03:05:11,650
Yeah, that's why I wanted to share that one because I just thought it was so funny that I actually thought that's what they talked about in the first episode.

2507
03:05:13,910 --> 03:05:20,190
And then, I have never heard anything, a single thing about that podcast.

2508
03:05:20,330 --> 03:05:24,110
Have you guys ever heard one thing that they've talked about?

2509
03:05:24,630 --> 03:05:25,090
Ever?

2510
03:05:25,870 --> 03:05:33,580
If we get around to doing JP songs again, can I request Sose no Aquarium?

2511
03:05:36,940 --> 03:05:39,060
Yeah, I can sing that.

2512
03:05:39,920 --> 03:05:41,360
Thanks for the super chat.

2513
03:05:44,080 --> 03:05:46,360
Let's sing Aquarium.

2514
03:05:52,500 --> 03:05:54,020
Here we go.

2515
03:06:28,900 --> 03:06:30,300
Aquarium.

2516
03:06:48,240 --> 03:06:49,640
Sorry.

2517
03:07:57,930 --> 03:07:58,050
I love Aquarium.

2518
03:08:25,030 --> 03:08:28,070
I love Aquarium.

2519
03:08:31,210 --> 03:08:32,990
I've been in love with you for a thousand years.

2520
03:08:33,010 --> 03:08:38,410
I've been missing you more since I was eight thousand years old.

2521
03:08:40,170 --> 03:08:41,510
I've been in love with you for a hundred million years.

2522
03:08:45,950 --> 03:08:52,990
Ever since I met you, music has been playing in my hell.

2523
03:08:58,830 --> 03:09:02,310
You've become an adult over and over again.

2524
03:09:02,310 --> 03:09:05,030
You've gone far away over and over again.

2525
03:09:05,430 --> 03:09:06,690
I watch over you.

2526
03:09:06,950 --> 03:09:07,790
I can't sleep.

2527
03:09:08,570 --> 03:09:10,950
Even if I'm all wrinkled up.

2528
03:09:18,950 --> 03:09:23,070
I sing your name.

2529
03:09:26,630 --> 03:09:28,970
I've been in love with you for a thousand years.

2530
03:09:32,710 --> 03:09:36,510
I've been missing you more since I was eight thousand years old.

2531
03:09:44,050 --> 03:09:46,270
I've been in love with you for a hundred million years.

2532
03:09:46,270 --> 03:09:48,890
Ever since I met you.

2533
03:09:53,730 --> 03:09:58,970
I've been in love with you for a hundred million years.

2534
03:09:58,990 --> 03:10:01,930
I've been missing you more since I was eight thousand years old.

2535
03:10:01,930 --> 03:10:07,990
I've been in love with you for a hundred million years.

2536
03:10:08,430 --> 03:10:19,330
Ever since I met you, music has been playing in my hell.

2537
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:42,300
Aquarium.

2538
03:10:43,040 --> 03:10:43,760
Nice!

2539
03:10:46,040 --> 03:10:47,260
Nice, nice.

2540
03:10:52,280 --> 03:10:55,800
I watch over you.

2541
03:10:56,100 --> 03:10:56,820
I can't sleep.

2542
03:10:57,620 --> 03:10:59,740
Even if I'm all wrinkled up.

2543
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:07,680
Let's see.

2544
03:11:18,900 --> 03:11:19,260
Let's see.

2545
03:11:19,260 --> 03:11:19,660
Eva opening.

2546
03:11:21,240 --> 03:11:24,640
I feel like people are so sick of that song, are they not?

2547
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:26,060
I mean, not that I am.

2548
03:11:26,660 --> 03:11:28,420
I guess it's kind of...

2549
03:11:28,420 --> 03:11:32,420
It'd be silly if I'm just like, I don't know if people are sick of that song, but I'm not even sick of that song.

2550
03:11:35,420 --> 03:11:36,360
Kind of, maybe.

2551
03:11:38,460 --> 03:11:42,660
Let's go, let me see what's in the caravan.

2552
03:11:43,500 --> 03:11:45,040
I am trying to sing.

2553
03:11:45,440 --> 03:11:46,940
What's in their 80s hits?

2554
03:11:48,400 --> 03:11:50,260
Oh, no, no, no, no, quiz.

2555
03:11:50,600 --> 03:11:51,480
No, no, no, no, no.

2556
03:11:51,600 --> 03:11:52,660
I'm not studying.

2557
03:11:53,260 --> 03:11:54,900
No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2558
03:11:54,980 --> 03:11:57,420
Oh, join the quiz using QR code.

2559
03:11:57,640 --> 03:11:58,800
Oh, no, I don't want to do that.

2560
03:11:59,620 --> 03:12:00,260
Let's see.

2561
03:12:00,900 --> 03:12:02,180
Rock love songs.

2562
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:09,360
No.

2563
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:11,540
Disney.

2564
03:12:15,040 --> 03:12:15,440
Ikanaide.

2565
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:17,500
I haven't sung that song in a long time.

2566
03:12:20,680 --> 03:12:21,720
Let me see.

2567
03:12:23,340 --> 03:12:23,740
Ikanaide.

2568
03:12:26,880 --> 03:12:28,800
I don't know if I'll be able to sing it very well.

2569
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:30,160
I can try.

2570
03:12:31,420 --> 03:12:32,320
Right now, I mean.

2571
03:12:32,320 --> 03:12:32,560
I don't know.

2572
03:12:46,880 --> 03:12:48,080
I've never sung this version.

2573
03:12:52,420 --> 03:12:53,840
It sounds so crunchy.

2574
03:12:55,480 --> 03:12:56,340
So crunchy.

2575
03:13:35,560 --> 03:13:38,380
I don't know.

2576
03:13:57,440 --> 03:14:00,240
I don't know.

2577
03:14:59,570 --> 03:15:13,530
I don't know.

2578
03:15:14,150 --> 03:15:42,850
Jikan dake ga sugite iku boku wo tsurete tte Kaerimichi kurai keredo hitori de daijoubu kana Gaido ni terasarete kage ga dekite iru hitoribocchi sa Tooku e to kiete iku boku wo oite tte

2579
03:15:46,630 --> 03:16:06,070
完全にまた今度 夜が滲んでいく 泣いちゃだめ 泣いちゃだめ でも本当は言いたいよ 行かないで 泣いちゃだめ 泣いちゃだめ でも本当は言いたいよ

2580
03:16:09,330 --> 03:17:02,290
行かないで I don't know if I've ever sung this before, so it's kind of kind of new for me.

2581
03:17:04,030 --> 03:17:10,890
Actually, YouTube is is suggesting something and I'm like, should I sing this?

2582
03:17:10,890 --> 03:17:18,270
I didn't get to sing it during the stream, so I'm like, maybe now is the time.

2583
03:17:19,770 --> 03:17:24,090
And I have permission to sing these whenever I feel they said I can.

2584
03:17:31,430 --> 03:17:32,450
Where is it?

2585
03:17:37,290 --> 03:17:40,370
I don't know if this one will get the stream taken down though.

2586
03:17:40,770 --> 03:17:41,370
Maybe not.

2587
03:17:42,210 --> 03:17:45,580
Hmm, that was lovely.

2588
03:17:45,640 --> 03:17:46,400
My heart hurts.

2589
03:17:47,440 --> 03:17:51,160
Actually, I will sing this one because this one will make my heart hurt.

2590
03:17:56,960 --> 03:17:57,900
Once again.

2591
03:18:00,820 --> 03:18:01,260
Okay.

2592
03:18:04,060 --> 03:18:04,680
Let's see.

2593
03:18:05,540 --> 03:18:09,040
Maybe I'll do this one since we just did a slow one and then I'll go to faster songs.

2594
03:23:03,320 --> 03:23:05,580
I managed to pull myself together.

2595
03:23:06,660 --> 03:23:11,080
I managed to pull myself together mostly.

2596
03:23:11,340 --> 03:23:12,200
Oh my gosh.

2597
03:23:14,340 --> 03:23:16,500
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2598
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:34,020
That was a Kuchizuke Kibun, which is maybe my favorite song from from my idol group that recently disbanded.

2599
03:23:35,820 --> 03:23:38,060
Named Tappokumi Inc.

2600
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:40,460
So, yeah.

2601
03:23:41,400 --> 03:23:43,040
So sad.

2602
03:23:43,600 --> 03:23:55,980
So that's why the song was going to make me cry because it's just, oh, it's one of those songs that just gets you like it ran to the heart.

2603
03:23:57,500 --> 03:23:59,840
Did they sing it at the last live?

2604
03:23:59,880 --> 03:24:00,640
They did.

2605
03:24:00,840 --> 03:24:03,200
I got to hear it both days, so I was very happy.

2606
03:24:04,700 --> 03:24:05,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2607
03:24:06,320 --> 03:24:15,040
But that made me, that made it worse because I was just crying, sobbing both days because of it.

2608
03:24:15,720 --> 03:24:22,020
I mean, obviously I was sobbing in general and not just me, everybody around too.

2609
03:24:22,860 --> 03:24:27,440
So it's okay, maybe.

2610
03:24:28,760 --> 03:24:31,080
Oh, I have another song I want to sing.

2611
03:24:36,950 --> 03:24:39,210
This is another Utada Hikaru song.

2612
03:24:39,390 --> 03:24:42,650
I've never sung before actually, so I'm a little nervous.

2613
03:24:42,810 --> 03:24:50,270
If I sing sorry, but I didn't practice and also, but I listened to the song like a lot.

2614
03:24:50,730 --> 03:24:52,170
So, hold on.

2615
03:24:56,930 --> 03:25:01,270
Let me look up the lyrics just in case this video doesn't have it.

2616
03:25:04,770 --> 03:25:06,370
Okay, I try singing.

2617
03:26:08,670 --> 03:26:15,130
In it with you, in love with you.

2618
03:26:16,150 --> 03:26:21,190
In it with you, in it with you.

2619
03:27:00,960 --> 03:27:05,740
I've been in love with you.

2620
03:27:07,620 --> 03:27:12,480
In it with you, in it with you.

2621
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:15,680
In love with you.

2622
03:27:17,260 --> 03:27:43,480
In it with you, in it with you But I can't believe in myself I don't believe in anything I don't exist, I'm just a green plant The only thing I can be sure of is the truth

2623
03:27:51,640 --> 03:28:02,180
No one can take away the contents of our hearts I can't protect it that much

2624
03:28:43,680 --> 03:28:45,700
In it with you.

2625
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:48,380
In it with you.

2626
03:28:48,860 --> 03:28:51,480
In love with you.

2627
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:06,120
This backing track sucks.

2628
03:29:14,660 --> 03:29:15,750
Wow, it sucked.

2629
03:29:18,560 --> 03:29:19,950
Go listen to the original!

2630
03:29:20,770 --> 03:29:21,490
It's so good.

2631
03:29:21,750 --> 03:29:22,450
It's called...

2632
03:29:26,390 --> 03:29:31,330
何色でもない花 Wait, why is it so far away?

2633
03:29:32,170 --> 03:29:33,070
There we go.

2634
03:29:47,210 --> 03:29:50,170
Whenever I like walk around in Japan, I have that song on.

2635
03:29:50,410 --> 03:29:51,590
It's like my walking song.

2636
03:29:51,910 --> 03:29:52,790
I don't know why.

2637
03:29:54,030 --> 03:29:55,930
And also, sorry my voice is so shaky.

2638
03:29:57,210 --> 03:29:59,210
My voice is still a little...

2639
03:29:59,850 --> 03:30:01,850
It's still a little...

2640
03:30:03,190 --> 03:30:04,230
You know?

2641
03:30:06,500 --> 03:30:08,850
But then I was also gonna do...

2642
03:30:09,730 --> 03:30:11,670
What was I gonna do?

2643
03:30:13,030 --> 03:30:16,110
Bizarre Quest, Uptown Girl by Billy Joel.

2644
03:30:16,190 --> 03:30:17,970
Like, uptown girl.

2645
03:30:18,690 --> 03:30:21,910
I've been living in an uptown world.

2646
03:30:28,090 --> 03:30:29,070
I don't know that.

2647
03:30:29,070 --> 03:30:29,850
I only know that part.

2648
03:30:32,590 --> 03:30:34,550
Wait, where did I save that?

2649
03:30:35,350 --> 03:30:37,510
Wait, maybe here?

2650
03:30:41,200 --> 03:30:41,720
Yes.

2651
03:30:45,460 --> 03:30:47,160
But, where are the lyrics?

2652
03:30:48,060 --> 03:30:48,940
Where did I save the lyrics?

2653
03:30:49,540 --> 03:30:51,260
I don't remember.

2654
03:30:53,180 --> 03:30:55,860
But I don't trust myself.

2655
03:30:56,160 --> 03:30:57,680
Maybe under...

2656
03:30:57,680 --> 03:30:58,200
Here.

2657
03:30:59,300 --> 03:30:59,760
Here.

2658
03:31:03,840 --> 03:31:05,280
Did I get deleted?

2659
03:31:05,520 --> 03:31:05,780
I don't know.

2660
03:31:06,820 --> 03:31:08,640
I wonder if I got deleted on my old computer.

2661
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:10,980
Jonathan, welcome to my bishop.

2662
03:31:11,100 --> 03:31:11,660
Thank you!

2663
03:31:12,420 --> 03:31:14,200
Did you guys see that tweet about how scary that was?

2664
03:31:14,200 --> 03:31:15,540
I saw that.

2665
03:31:17,040 --> 03:31:17,940
Robbie Williams.

2666
03:31:18,140 --> 03:31:19,300
Who is that guy?

2667
03:31:19,380 --> 03:31:20,360
He's the monkey, right?

2668
03:31:20,360 --> 03:31:21,680
Oh, I do have the lyrics.

2669
03:31:21,780 --> 03:31:22,380
Okay, I'm perfect.

2670
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:23,600
Awesome.

2671
03:31:25,280 --> 03:31:25,980
Okey dokey.

2672
03:31:27,020 --> 03:31:28,340
Nice, nice, nice.

2673
03:31:49,800 --> 03:31:50,660
Jump scare.

2674
03:31:51,500 --> 03:31:52,020
Does

2675
03:32:00,980 --> 03:32:02,520
it have my backing vocals in it?

2676
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:06,000
It's gonna sound a little empty sometimes.

2677
03:32:06,660 --> 03:32:06,860
Haha.

2678
03:32:36,660 --> 03:32:40,380
I can't see it, I can't touch it, I can't feel it.

2679
03:32:40,840 --> 03:32:44,320
The thorns of my heart are being snatched away.

2680
03:32:45,220 --> 03:32:47,280
There's no way I can meet you.

2681
03:32:47,560 --> 03:32:50,300
I want to see you, but why does it hurt?

2682
03:32:51,060 --> 03:32:53,420
I keep picking up the words I've lost.

2683
03:32:55,280 --> 03:32:58,080
In the long journey to the end.

2684
03:32:59,340 --> 03:33:03,140
I'm lost, but the miracle is shaking.

2685
03:33:03,380 --> 03:33:03,640
Ah!

2686
03:33:03,980 --> 03:33:04,540
Thank you!

2687
03:33:04,540 --> 03:33:05,200
Brother.

2688
03:33:06,080 --> 03:33:11,780
I'm sure I'll love the pain in your chest, Phantom Face.

2689
03:33:12,300 --> 03:33:13,940
Wow, like a phantom.

2690
03:33:15,870 --> 03:33:19,710
I sang a cover of this song for Touhou Last Word.

2691
03:33:20,870 --> 03:33:23,590
So now I'm singing it on stream.

2692
03:33:26,230 --> 03:33:28,730
I got lost in the moonlight.

2693
03:33:30,070 --> 03:33:31,610
I hug the heavy wind.

2694
03:33:31,610 --> 03:33:31,990
I hold your hand.

2695
03:33:33,770 --> 03:33:38,830
If I trace it with my dark fingers, The pain that pierces through to the past.

2696
03:33:41,550 --> 03:33:44,590
This is too bad.

2697
03:33:44,930 --> 03:33:45,630
Pity.

2698
03:33:46,090 --> 03:33:47,810
Oh, sweet dreams.

2699
03:33:48,470 --> 03:33:51,930
We keep screaming with tears in our eyes.

2700
03:33:53,570 --> 03:33:54,310
Encore.

2701
03:33:54,570 --> 03:33:55,050
I want to disappear.

2702
03:33:55,350 --> 03:33:55,870
Forget it.

2703
03:33:56,290 --> 03:33:57,190
I can't remember.

2704
03:33:57,990 --> 03:34:00,230
I was made to dance.

2705
03:34:00,230 --> 03:34:01,250
The shadow of my heart.

2706
03:34:02,510 --> 03:34:03,870
There's no way it exists.

2707
03:34:04,070 --> 03:34:04,710
I know.

2708
03:34:05,370 --> 03:34:07,410
If that's the case, why does it hurt?

2709
03:34:11,620 --> 03:34:13,480
I take a step forward.

2710
03:34:13,780 --> 03:34:17,500
I'll find my way to the end of the journey.

2711
03:34:18,360 --> 03:34:21,440
No matter how much pain there is, I'm sure.

2712
03:34:36,830 --> 03:34:38,670
I kept on dancing.

2713
03:34:38,670 --> 03:34:40,630
Wait, I lost my phone.

2714
03:34:43,980 --> 03:34:45,460
Phantom Face.

2715
03:34:47,400 --> 03:34:49,320
I lost a part in the lyrics.

2716
03:34:51,440 --> 03:34:52,600
Who saw it?

2717
03:34:52,840 --> 03:34:53,480
I can't see it.

2718
03:34:53,580 --> 03:34:54,380
I can't touch it.

2719
03:34:54,500 --> 03:34:55,280
I can't feel it.

2720
03:34:56,200 --> 03:34:56,640
It's taken away.

2721
03:34:57,800 --> 03:34:59,540
The thorns of my heart.

2722
03:35:00,880 --> 03:35:02,280
There's no way it exists.

2723
03:35:02,280 --> 03:35:02,520
I know.

2724
03:35:03,140 --> 03:35:05,660
If that's the case, why does it hurt?

2725
03:35:06,440 --> 03:35:08,480
I keep picking up the words I've lost.

2726
03:35:10,500 --> 03:35:13,280
I'll find my way to the end of the journey.

2727
03:35:13,280 --> 03:35:15,860
While I'm lost in the city.

2728
03:35:16,680 --> 03:35:18,660
If I can believe in a miracle.

2729
03:35:22,120 --> 03:35:24,420
I'm sure I can love the pain in my heart.

2730
03:35:24,680 --> 03:35:26,280
Phantom Face.

2731
03:35:28,180 --> 03:35:30,280
Like a Phantom Face.

2732
03:35:31,500 --> 03:35:33,820
Won't cry in the rain.

2733
03:36:14,860 --> 03:36:16,200
Oh my gosh.

2734
03:36:16,360 --> 03:36:17,780
The song is still so...

2735
03:36:17,780 --> 03:36:20,380
There's parts where it's like...

2736
03:36:21,900 --> 03:36:22,700
Where is it?

2737
03:36:23,260 --> 03:36:24,020
I can't see it.

2738
03:36:24,080 --> 03:36:24,900
I can't touch it.

2739
03:36:25,660 --> 03:36:26,540
I can't feel it.

2740
03:36:27,380 --> 03:36:28,900
I can't see it.

2741
03:36:28,960 --> 03:36:29,620
I can't touch it.

2742
03:36:29,940 --> 03:36:30,580
I can't feel it.

2743
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:32,080
It's like a tongue twister.

2744
03:36:34,320 --> 03:36:35,920
It's taken away.

2745
03:36:37,240 --> 03:36:38,180
The thorns of my heart.

2746
03:36:39,200 --> 03:36:39,460
Thorns.

2747
03:36:40,080 --> 03:36:41,460
There's no way it exists.

2748
03:36:41,460 --> 03:36:41,680
I know.

2749
03:36:42,060 --> 03:36:45,160
If that's the case, why does it hurt?

2750
03:36:45,360 --> 03:36:45,920
That part.

2751
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:46,580
I can't see it.

2752
03:36:46,600 --> 03:36:46,960
I can't touch it.

2753
03:36:47,480 --> 03:36:48,520
I can't feel it.

2754
03:36:48,520 --> 03:36:48,960
I can't touch it.

2755
03:36:51,060 --> 03:36:53,800
I had to do that part like maybe like...

2756
03:36:54,620 --> 03:36:55,420
20 times.

2757
03:36:59,580 --> 03:37:01,480
Thank you for the five gifted.

2758
03:37:01,560 --> 03:37:02,480
Oh my gosh, there were so many five.

2759
03:37:02,640 --> 03:37:03,180
There were so many gifted.

2760
03:37:03,380 --> 03:37:03,960
Thank you guys.

2761
03:37:04,420 --> 03:37:05,220
Thank you for the gifted.

2762
03:37:06,120 --> 03:37:06,840
I'm scrolling.

2763
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:07,800
Thanks for the gifted.

2764
03:37:10,280 --> 03:37:11,380
Thank you guys.

2765
03:37:11,480 --> 03:37:11,740
Thank you.

2766
03:37:11,940 --> 03:37:14,820
It's only showing me up to there, but...

2767
03:37:19,940 --> 03:37:21,220
It was so much.

2768
03:37:22,260 --> 03:37:23,100
And then...

2769
03:37:25,960 --> 03:37:27,660
Well, that was a part of that song.

2770
03:37:29,900 --> 03:37:30,860
No, that one was good.

2771
03:37:32,160 --> 03:37:33,000
It's the...

2772
03:37:34,760 --> 03:37:36,520
I would just have to sit there and go...

2773
03:37:38,620 --> 03:37:39,920
I have phantom pain.

2774
03:37:40,020 --> 03:37:41,260
So does my home screen theme.

2775
03:37:41,480 --> 03:37:42,940
Good luck for everybody entering the giveaways.

2776
03:37:43,420 --> 03:37:44,600
Yay, thank you.

2777
03:37:45,680 --> 03:37:47,020
Spank thanks for the 20 gifted.

2778
03:37:47,120 --> 03:37:48,260
Thank you so much.

2779
03:37:48,800 --> 03:37:51,180
If you could talk to David Hayter, what would you want to say?

2780
03:37:51,260 --> 03:37:52,560
I've talked to David Hayter before.

2781
03:37:57,160 --> 03:37:58,260
Oh my gosh.

2782
03:37:58,300 --> 03:38:00,080
I just realized how long I've been streaming for.

2783
03:38:00,180 --> 03:38:00,720
Holy moly.

2784
03:38:03,060 --> 03:38:03,500
What?

2785
03:38:03,780 --> 03:38:04,220
Seriously?

2786
03:38:04,480 --> 03:38:05,120
That's crazy.

2787
03:38:06,200 --> 03:38:08,560
I have so many more TikToks I was going to show.

2788
03:38:08,680 --> 03:38:10,520
But I think I'm actually going to end it with...

2789
03:38:11,560 --> 03:38:12,740
This last song.

2790
03:38:12,740 --> 03:38:12,860
I don't know.

2791
03:38:17,980 --> 03:38:20,200
It's been almost four hours.

2792
03:38:20,720 --> 03:38:20,840
Wow.

2793
03:38:24,480 --> 03:38:27,520
I talked to David Hayter and I basically thanked him.

2794
03:38:27,940 --> 03:38:28,840
I was just like, wow.

2795
03:38:29,060 --> 03:38:30,020
You don't know this.

2796
03:38:30,700 --> 03:38:36,240
But you changed the entire trajectory of my career path.

2797
03:38:36,700 --> 03:38:39,380
Not path, but...

2798
03:38:40,840 --> 03:38:43,580
I told him, I was just like...

2799
03:38:45,190 --> 03:38:46,840
You don't understand.

2800
03:38:48,800 --> 03:38:54,840
How much things changed after Metal Gear.

2801
03:38:56,340 --> 03:38:59,540
It's still so much fun to have people come in and be like...

2802
03:39:00,680 --> 03:39:02,840
People will comment and be like...

2803
03:39:02,840 --> 03:39:04,380
It's really cool to see someone...

2804
03:39:05,260 --> 03:39:07,520
A Vtuber so into Metal Gear.

2805
03:39:08,100 --> 03:39:09,060
Things like that.

2806
03:39:10,340 --> 03:39:11,060
So...

2807
03:39:12,200 --> 03:39:15,840
Those kinds of moments are really precious to me.

2808
03:39:19,520 --> 03:39:27,220
I feel like I got known as a Vtuber that loves Metal Gear so much.

2809
03:39:28,580 --> 03:39:29,800
And so...

2810
03:39:29,800 --> 03:39:35,380
Maybe made a different...

2811
03:39:36,880 --> 03:39:37,920
What's the word?

2812
03:39:37,920 --> 03:39:40,800
A different name for me, maybe.

2813
03:39:43,780 --> 03:39:44,620
I don't know.

2814
03:39:44,740 --> 03:39:47,080
It's hard to explain.

2815
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:49,520
I couldn't really explain it so well to him.

2816
03:39:50,660 --> 03:39:51,700
So I was like...

2817
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:55,280
And he was like, that's cool.

2818
03:40:02,380 --> 03:40:03,420
Hold on a second.

2819
03:40:03,420 --> 03:40:04,420
Let me...

2820
03:40:07,140 --> 03:40:08,580
One second, one second.

2821
03:40:10,960 --> 03:40:12,800
This last song...

2822
03:40:12,800 --> 03:40:15,060
One second, I have to get it up actually.

2823
03:40:15,520 --> 03:40:18,220
Where did I save the lyrics to?

2824
03:40:24,460 --> 03:40:29,420
Sorry, I didn't get through all my TikToks.

2825
03:40:30,320 --> 03:40:32,580
But they're stupid anyway, so it's fine.

2826
03:40:35,240 --> 03:40:36,640
My voice is starting...

2827
03:40:36,640 --> 03:40:40,840
Not to hurt, but it's starting to feel like it's reaching its limit.

2828
03:40:41,160 --> 03:40:43,800
So I'm just like, okay, I will...

2829
03:40:43,800 --> 03:40:46,200
I'll call it after this one last song.

2830
03:40:46,240 --> 03:40:48,120
I wanted to do at least like 15 songs.

2831
03:40:48,460 --> 03:40:49,580
So I hit my...

2832
03:40:51,100 --> 03:40:52,920
I was able to watch lots of funny things.

2833
03:40:53,320 --> 03:40:54,380
And that was so much fun.

2834
03:40:54,740 --> 03:40:57,460
And I was also able to sing some songs.

2835
03:40:57,780 --> 03:40:58,740
So that's good too.

2836
03:40:59,960 --> 03:41:01,340
Where is this person?

2837
03:41:01,520 --> 03:41:02,120
Oh my god.

2838
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:10,580
Okie dokie.

2839
03:41:13,940 --> 03:41:15,560
Open, save image.

2840
03:41:15,740 --> 03:41:16,120
There we go.

2841
03:41:16,760 --> 03:41:20,600
I did not save the lyrics, I just realized.

2842
03:41:20,740 --> 03:41:20,840
Okay.

2843
03:41:24,060 --> 03:41:26,540
So this last song is a cover.

2844
03:41:33,550 --> 03:41:35,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2845
03:41:36,380 --> 03:41:37,600
Thank you so much.

2846
03:41:42,650 --> 03:41:43,370
Cover song.

2847
03:41:47,410 --> 03:41:49,210
Wait, hold on.

2848
03:41:49,330 --> 03:41:52,510
Before I explain it, let me pull up the song.

2849
03:42:07,220 --> 03:42:07,940
One second.

2850
03:42:08,580 --> 03:42:09,240
There we go, maybe.

2851
03:42:15,040 --> 03:42:15,500
Okay, perfect.

2852
03:42:16,140 --> 03:42:17,800
Okay, so this is a cover of a song.

2853
03:42:19,080 --> 03:42:20,460
I'm sorry if I don't sing it very well.

2854
03:42:20,460 --> 03:42:26,640
But a group I like...

2855
03:42:26,640 --> 03:42:28,280
Their name is Mosaic Wave.

2856
03:42:29,220 --> 03:42:29,900
They recently...

2857
03:42:29,900 --> 03:42:33,720
They recently put out a cover album.

2858
03:42:34,280 --> 03:42:35,620
And this was one of the songs on it.

2859
03:42:35,680 --> 03:42:37,480
I thought it was really cute, so I was going to sing it.

2860
03:42:38,720 --> 03:42:39,120
And...

2861
03:42:41,680 --> 03:42:42,480
And so...

2862
03:42:42,480 --> 03:42:43,160
Yeah.

2863
03:42:45,780 --> 03:42:47,480
I'm going to sing it.

2864
03:42:47,600 --> 03:42:49,220
And this will be the last song.

2865
03:42:50,080 --> 03:42:50,880
You've heard of them?

2866
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:52,180
Yeah, I love Mosaic Wave.

2867
03:42:53,880 --> 03:42:54,620
Okay, here I go.

2868
03:43:19,260 --> 03:43:28,960

2880
03:46:24,950 --> 03:46:25,850

No!

2882
03:46:27,210 --> 03:46:29,130
