Thank you.

44
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:17,980
Thank you.

45
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,940
Yeah, I never thought I would be able to do something.

46
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,480
I mean, well, to be fair, I was going to say I never thought I'd be able to do something on that level as, like, an indie.

47
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,420
And to be fair, the project got started when I...

48
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Because of Yishojo.

49
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,980
So, it's not that I did it completely as an indie.

50
00:06:49,540 --> 00:07:02,860
But, you know, also, like, I guess also, how do you say, like, sometimes, not always, not always is the case.

51
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:18,480
I don't want to speak for every company, but some companies, they cover those types of events, you know, they either have their own studios or they'll, you know, if it's like a special event like that, they will cover the cost.

52
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:26,400
So for me, I was just like, the cost would always be so insane that I would never be able to do it myself.

53
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:46,780
But, you know, because of all of your, you know, your generosity and everything, of course I, of course I would want to go with something really high quality to give back, you know, so.

54
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,180
Because they even gave me a cheaper option.

55
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,000
They were like, it would be much less expensive.

56
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,020
It wouldn't look as nice.

57
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,620
And I was like, no.

58
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,420
I want it to look the best it could look.

59
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,260
Holy mama, did you deliver?

60
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,080
I really wanted to go as much all out as I could.

61
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,200
Original song was so cool.

62
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,120
Thank you.

63
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,800
I'm glad you liked it.

64
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

65
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,260
You'll have to wait a little longer for the music video that I definitely have started.

66
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,760
Actually, I've had the song since like the beginning of this year.

67
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:47,180
But when I recorded it, originally, it was when my voice was just starting to get bad.

68
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,260
I actually asked if I could re-record it.

69
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,220
So I was like, I was like, I know that so much has been done.

70
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,560
I know that the song, you mixed the song and it's finished now, but my voice was so bad.

71
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,640
Please.

72
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,260
Oh gosh, right now my voice is bad though.

73
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,700
Right now my voice is bad, so don't think about it, but...

74
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:54,450
yeah been jamming all day thank you thank you thank you thank you so so i said i was just like please if there's any way yeah post a clip of your ori song from the concert so we can loop it maybe but but i would rather wait until like the actual music video,

75
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,710
no?

76
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,910
We'll see, we'll see.

77
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,970
But yeah, I did, I mentioned it in the concert, but I did get to record at Toei Studios.

78
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,910
I also retweeted them on Twitter.

79
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,950
The studios that I worked with, they were so, so, so nice.

80
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,290
And yeah, it was really awesome.

81
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:54,470

82
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,930
Yes, of course that was me.

83
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,850
That was all me, baby.

84
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,190
You can even see...

85
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,030
I...

86
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,250
I was...

87
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:06,670
I...

88
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,450
You can see, uh...

89
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,530
There's a part in...

90
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,230
in a cute vampire girl.

91
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,730
Where I'm doing the dance.

92
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,730
And...

93
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,990
I lose my balance.

94
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,730
I lose my balance that I let go like

95
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:49,830
You saw Don't say don't notice Say right now that it was flawless And that you didn't notice at all No no don't say you saw Say what I couldn't tell At all Oh why no it was It was you danced perfectly It was flawless Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,870
I know, right?

97
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,050
Now you'll notice because I told you.

98
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,150
Now you'll notice because I told you.

99
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,910
It was flawless and I did not notice at all.

100
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,630
Only saw perfection.

102
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,030
I also...

103
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,610
You might be wondering too why my original song was done with the mic.

104
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,990
It's because I didn't have time to...

105
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,670
Well, I thought about it.

106
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,830
Like, should I make my own choreo for the song or should I get somebody?

107
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:30,670
And I thought about it and I think I went to commission a dancer for original choreography for it.

108
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,730
So that's why there's a mic stand until I have a full choreography.

109
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,470
Thank you.

110
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,670
Thank you.

111
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,590
So sorry for my...

112
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,370
for my voice today.

113
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,870
I missed you guys past couple days, though.

114
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,030
I haven't been able to say hello, so...

115
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,710
Never once noticed any mistakes VTubers claim to make during performances after the fact.

116
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,490
I think you'll probably notice that one.

117
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,390
I think you'll probably notice it.

118
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:23,470
But I think it's usually because maybe a lot of VTubers Just not a...

119
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,450
Well, a lot of...

120
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,550
You know, they'll have, like, choreographed dances.

121
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,610
But if you don't know the dance moves, how would you know that the dance was wrong, right?

122
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,090
So...

123
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,430
Setup was so good.

124
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,550
More, like, personality came through, especially on the dancing, which was completely flawless.

125
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,570
Thank you!

126
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,890
I practiced so much.

127
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,010
Hmm.

128
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,570
I practiced all the dances.

129
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,430
The dance with Kiwawa.

130
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,470
Actually...

131
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,990
Thank you.

132
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,470

136
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,850

167
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,030
She didn't know either.

168
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,570
I know.

169
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,870
Oh my god.

170
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,930
Like when she has a 3D.

171
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,230
Well, she's done like 3D stuff already.

172
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,810
But that was like her birthday and everything.

173
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,970
Yeah.

174
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,410

177
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,900
Can we do...

178
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,060
Was that like...

179
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,700
So crazy to...

180
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,160
To switch locations?

181
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,980
And they were like...

182
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,440
We can probably do it.

183
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,940
Everything I would ask for, they were like, yeah, we could do it.

184
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,800
So I was really, really happy.

185
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,480
And, you know, I can also use them again in the future.

186
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,680
So we can't forget the stairs.

187
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,180
Yeah!

188
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,640
Do you guys like that?

189
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,960
I thought that was, you know, it's...

190
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:27,800
I feel like almost something you don't see very often in, like, VTuber concerts or people walking down stairs.

191
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,180
Why is that?

192
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,640
What is that?

193
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,360
Many Beethoven's Walking Downstairs.

194
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,720
I had to flex a little bit.

195
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,480
Honestly, the studio was so large because they also filmed some of the animations for Common Rider and stuff in it.

196
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,740
So it was very, very tall.

197
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,320
And in the future, if I ever want to fly, they can rig me up.

198
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,480
And they can fly me around the studio.

199
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:38,720
Oh yeah, I retweeted the studio And this morning and I was looking at their Twitter And right underneath Right underneath the post about being like We were in charge of the animation And motion and everything for Mint Phantom Right underneath was We were in charge for the motion and expressions for And I was like...

200
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,240
No,

201
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,420
why?

202
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,740
So cool.

203
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,040
Sorry, I work.

204
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,620
Oh, no.

205
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,860
How could they work?

206
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,320
Common Rider Minto.

207
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,920
Oh, so.

208
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,960
I worked with the big boys.

209
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,700
I worked with the big boys.

210
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,660
A ghost that can fly preposterous.

211
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,300
Yeah, beam me up.

212
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,360
Yeah, kind of crazy.

213
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,920
Kind of crazy.

214
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,880
I do have...

215
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,000
I do have merch that will be up.

216
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,900
I haven't decided a time yet.

217
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,100
I was looking at Toyzukun Labs credits afterwards and they did the facial capture for DMC Vita.

218
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,340
DMC 5?

219
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,260
What?

220
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,570
crazy it was fate yeah

221
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:27,090
but I thought a lot about the set list a lot of songs that I wanted to perform and things that also were kind of spooky like cute vampire girl I've always wanted to perform that like dance and everything so so

222
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,870
Even though I'm not a vampire, I'm a ghost, but it's still spooky.

223
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,530
I tried to think of a lot of stuff.

224
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,580
I had a lot of fun watching your 3D live yesterday.

225
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,560
Thank you!

226
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,240
If you see the video I had made for you.

227
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,440
Oh, the princess one?

228
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,730
I did.

229
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,590
Thank you for singing Iron Master!

230
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,010
Oh my god!

231
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,950
Nah.

232
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,330
Guy is very skilled with his feet.

233
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,210
How does he do that clapping with his feet like that?

234
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,770
It's so loud.

235
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,670
I can't even clap that loud with my hands.

236
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,830
Did you see the other one?

237
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,750
There's more than one?

238
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,350
Wait, there's...

239
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,590
There's more than one!

240
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,690
I'll be honest guys, I'm a little brain dead today, so...

241
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,050
I...

242
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:51,470
I...

243
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,430
I've been kind of like just...

244
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,530
There's just been...

245
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:01,810
I...

246
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,050
Sorry, wait, what am I saying?

247
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,130
I... I have been...

248
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,910
Brain dead today.

249
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,710
Yes.

250
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,490
I kind of have not even really looked at Twitter so much.

251
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,710
But we can look.

252
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,370
We will look at the hashtag and stuff.

253
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

254
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,670
Happy birthday, Minto.

256
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,870
Thank you.

257
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,150
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

258
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,570
I'm just...

259
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:33,890
Ah.

260
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,790
But...

261
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,180
I'm glad that everybody seemed to enjoy the concert.

262
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,780
I'm really, really happy.

263
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:07,020
Thank you to everybody that helped me work on it and everything.

264
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:09,920
Yeah.

265
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,420
Oh, let me say...

266
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,860
Oh, hold on.

267
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,320
I'm talking about the merch stuff.

268
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,540
It'll

269
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,960
be 19 again!

270
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,880
Feeling good!

271
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,960
Feeling good!

272
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

273
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,680
One second.

274
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:25,640
But yeah, everybody, I have to update some of the credits in the in the description but um yeah please you know uh big thanks to the whole team everybody who helped with the concert and everything and um i'm trying to think of any other stories to tell uh i do remember i oh gosh i remember going to the studio

275
00:28:30,140 --> 00:29:01,600
like toy studios and it's actually quite far away from tokyo um and i was going and you so basically i had to take a train there and then from there you take a bus but i was like oh well it's like a i think it was like a 15 minute 20 minute yeah like a 20 15 20 minute car ride and i'm so bad at figuring out buses.

276
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,920
So I was just like, I'll just get a taxi from the station.

277
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,980
That will be best.

278
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,460
And I waited for a taxi.

279
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,380
There was a guy waiting in front of me for a taxi.

280
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,920
And I was waiting behind him.

281
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,160
And he was waiting.

282
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,220
And waiting.

283
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,560
And I was early.

284
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,040
I was like 45 minutes early.

285
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,540
So I'm waiting.

286
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,640
And waiting.

287
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,280
And waiting.

288
00:29:27,920 --> 00:30:07,720
And then the guy leaves because no show up and I was like well surely surely one will show up for me and I wait and I wait and then I was like oh I don't think I don't think a taxi is coming and I And at that point, I asked about the bus, and I asked a policeman about the bus,

289
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
and he did not help me.

290
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,900
So I was like, I think I have to walk.

291
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,980
And so, in the sweltering heat of summer.

292
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,040
Uber, you can call Uber in Japan, but Uber has banned me.

293
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,500
I can't use Uber.

294
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:57,140
so i cannot call and then i try using like those go taxi apps but they don't accept my card for some reason i don't know i didn't do anything in uber i did not one day i was banned i didn't do anything i swear i swear i pinky swear i did not do anything to uber i think it was because

295
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,680
The last time I used it was, I think it was like Anime Expo.

296
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,160
Oh, many, many years ago.

297
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,340
Like, like five plus years ago.

298
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,540
And my hotel was pretty close.

299
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,900
But, like, not...

300
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,680
I'm not, I'm not gonna...

301
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm not gonna...

302
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm not gonna walk at, like, 2 a.m.

303
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,280
by myself in downtown LA.

304
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,960
So I would do Uber.

305
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,360
I would do Uber.

306
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,600
And then, and then it was, but it was like such a short distance.

307
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,360
I've heard that they don't like you if you do really short distances.

308
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,100
And so I did that so many times because I was going back and forth the whole weekend.

309
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,060
I think maybe that's why they banned me.

310
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:56,960
Oopsie.

311
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,870
That's the only thing I could think of because I was the last time.

312
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:51,650
unless also it was like my first time using an an app but or like a like the uber app it was my first time using an app ever I know it was my first time ever doing like the ride share thing and I got into the front seat of the guy's car and maybe she didn't like that make a new account it's with one are you guys serious for right now it's it is connected to your phone number i have one phone just make a new account idiot oh okay let me let me just sign up for another phone plan god

So, sorry.

That was my first time.

318
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,690
I don't want them to feel like they're chauffeuring me around, even though that's what they are doing.

319
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:06,500
But I want them to be like, oh yeah, it's different.

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,160
You too can be part of the Ghost Hunt crew!

334
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,500
Yeah!

335
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,900
The material, the printing of it is going to be like kind of that puffy...

336
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:36,400
coffee paint kind of material so you can rub your body and feel it.

337
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,120
But yeah, I drew that and that's awesome, my handwriting.

338
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:46,900
So I kind of wanted to be like a, like a, like an official, like a, how do you say?

339
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,540
Like a, like a staff shirt, you know, kind of.

340
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:29,800
Something like, I've been into those like varsity style things recently and i was like well this isn't quite varsity style i change it up a little bit but yeah cruiser yeah like a uniform a uniform no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so um crew yeah we but you know don't like you're hunting but you're getting haunted by me so i thought it was kind of cute.

341
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,540
I was like, don't think so much about the ghost hunt.

342
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,680
You're going ghost hunting for Minto.

343
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
And then I drew that.

344
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,040
I drew the picture.

345
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:45,940
Yeah.

346
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,560
I think it's pretty cute.

347
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,520
So I hope you like it.

348
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,460
Yeah.

349
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,800
I drew that.

350
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:26,300
And also kind of wanted it to be like not super in your face anime but also if you if you if i see you if if someone sees you wearing it and knows me they'll be like oh yes that's me phantom you know so yeah i because i asked before i was just like do you guys like what what's wrong with my mouth Do you guys like...

351
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,300
Or in your face or subtle, but I'm in your face girly, so...

352
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:39,380
But at the same time, I know not everybody is, so I felt this was a good middle ground for us, okay?

353
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,800
I felt this was a good middle ground.

354
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,300
That is not...

355
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,800
Like, like, oh, that's definitely an anime girl.

356
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,320
So, yeah.

357
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,340
Yeah.

358
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,080
Good.

359
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
You like it?

360
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,460
Thank you.

361
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,580
It's subtle but cute.

362
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,440
I felt like it's also a type that anybody could wear.

363
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,500
It's cute for girl and cute for boy.

364
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,780
Anybody.

365
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,280
Cute for anybody.

366
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,680
Anyone can wear.

367
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:24,920
Yes.

368
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Yeah, it doesn't have my pant- my panties on the back, so...

369
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,840
It does not have my panties on the back, so...

370
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,080
Rejoice.

371
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
You can wear this in public.

372
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,040
Or you could wear it in public anyway.

373
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,340
Anyway, next.

374
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,380
Sandy!

375
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,960
Sandy of the logo.

376
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
For the...

377
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,960
The concert and then also me!

378
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,560
The picture the Ayami mama drew.

379
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,100
It is plastic.

380
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
That's what acrylic stands are, yes.

381
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,760
Yes, yes, yes.

382
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,020
Is it one to one?

383
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,660
Shut up!

384
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,800
Next is a blanket!

385
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,720
It's starting to get...

386
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,100
Okay, first of all, I did not write these descriptions.

387
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,460
I don't know who wrote these.

388
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:42,280
But I didn't have time to even read them before I showed them on stream.

389
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,240
But it's starting to get kind of chilly.

390
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,600
I was just like, well, this is a Halloween show, right?

391
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,760
So you can get a blanket.

392
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,860
And this one does not have...

393
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,700
It's a clean version.

394
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,240
It does not have the logo on it.

395
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,760
So you can see the full art and all its glory.

396
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,220
Fua, fua, mofu, mofu.

397
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,620
Which is very true.

398
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,960
It is fua, foa, mofu, mofu.

399
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,580
So, it is a lap blanket.

400
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,380
I have one of these of Ayami Mama, actually.

401
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,340
So, wait.

402
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,920
It's kind of funny because this is also Ayami Mama art.

403
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,280
And, um, but, but my cat really loves it.

404
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

405
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
Fluffy snuff.

406
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,980
You can...

407
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,500
You can...

408
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,060
I will keep you one!

409
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,520
Next.

410
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,680
Slippers!

411
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,120
It does say delay.

412
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,940
That's so funny.

413
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,500
You can get two, the slippers that I have on my very feet!

414
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,720
But...

415
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,340
Also, basically all of this merch was like...

416
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,940
Stuff that I wanted to put out.

417
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:33,800
with V-Shojo and but with the people I'm working with now they were like we could do it it will just be a bit longer if that's okay with you and I was like oh I guess so cuz I would what I don't really have another occasion to do it with so yes yes yes jiggle jiggle jiggle wiggle jiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle the most wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly why Why is the ringing so crazy here?

418
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,260
So yeah, if you decide to get the...

419
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,460
The slippers, it will cause the order to be delayed a little bit.

420
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,200
I'm so sorry.

421
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,160
But...

422
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,140
Are they pre-worn?

423
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,220
They could be.

424
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,160
You want that?

425
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,040
Extra service?

426
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,980
I'll like wear them around the cafe.

427
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,920
Get them nice and sweaty.

428
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,240
Can you wear the slippers?

429
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,320
Stop it.

430
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,540
Why do you all have the same idea?

431
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,540
One...

432
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,840
I was gonna...

433
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,560
I was gonna joke, like, one special...

434
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,040
One special purchase will be pre-worn.

435
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,700
But I don't want to...

436
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,360
I don't even want to even joke about it because someone will take it seriously.

437
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,060
They'll be like...

438
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,460
It'll be like me!

439
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,240
Whee!

440
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,650
Next!

441
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,990
Da da da da!

442
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,790
A plushy!

443
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,270
So we have mini Minto and now we have Fumo style.

444
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,630
Plushy 40 centimeters.

445
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,490
One pair of pre-warred slipper please.

446
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,270
Okay, it's for you Marina, I will.

447
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:02,890
Yeah!

448
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:10,200
This is, this image is also a prototype image, so it might come looking a little differently than this.

449
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,020
Just letting you know.

450
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,170
Um, but yeah, you too.

451
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,130
Thank you!

452
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:30,090
You too can now get, um, a bigger binto plushie if you would want so.

453
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,410
Yes, yes, yes.

454
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,950
Next!

455
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,210
That's it.

456
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:45,830
So yeah, for these five items, we do also have, we have a bundle pack.

457
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:58,670
But hold on, before you get scared about the limited quantity, for the bundle pack only, it is a limited quantity.

458
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:33,970
But everything else, like if you get things individually and hold on I'm getting ahead of myself if you get everything if you get things individually it is made to order so yes only the bundle pack is is limited quantity but that's because the birthday bundle has a small little discount if you get everything and then also comes with a Signed,

459
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:33,970
exclusive.

460
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,750
Ooh, signed.

461
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:47,370
But if you're like, oh, well, I only just wanted the Fuma.

462
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:53,470
So basically how it was explained to me is, hold on, okay, I'm going to get this correct.

463
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,050
I'm going to get this right.

464
00:44:59,110 --> 00:44:59,610
So.

465
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:00,870
So.

466
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,970
I'm gonna double check.

467
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,050
Okay.

468
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,930
So, there

469
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:23,570
is a set...

470
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,630
Wait, okay.

471
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:26,550
Okay.

472
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,150
So there's going to be... The first orders that will be prioritized is the bundle.

473
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,110
So if you get the birthday, a bundle.

474
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,110
And I apologize in advance.

475
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:46,830
I realized that I picked such, like, kind of big things that that the bundle ends up being and ends up being a little expensive.

476
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:47,870
I'm sorry!

477
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,470
It's... I was just like, oh, wait.

478
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,990
Because, like, you know, it's all kind of, like, big stuff.

479
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:56,990
I'm sorry!

480
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:03,290
But, if you get the bundle, those are the orders that are prioritized first.

481
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:20,350
And then everything that is made that is after the bundle after the bundle those orders will be shipped out later

482
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:31,690
yes my brain my brain

483
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:45,230
yes I think it was like a December estimated Maybe, maybe, maybe January because of the slippers.

484
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,470
Oh!

485
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,630
I got told I explained it right.

486
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:52,630

00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,970

00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,040
Honestly, I don't know.

532
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,900

It's not sold out.

536
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,760

00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,760

00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,000
Also, it doesn't sell out.

Imagine the slippers will be like a Don't worry I'm sure they are Prioritizing the feet of the larger size So...

558
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,540
But it's those kinds of slippers, like the ones...

00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,240
Like even my feet could wear them because they're like, you know...

561
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,180
They're just kind of like a slipping, you know?

562
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,560
So if you have smaller feet...

563
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,760
It also will work.

564
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,840

565
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:39,840

572
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,060
So don't worry.

573
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,700

00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,920

00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,090

582
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:22,490
Wait.

583
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,730
Is that centimeter or so?

584
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,070
43 in EU.

585
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,790
Okay, that's EU size.

586
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,690
Can you imagine?

587
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,680
Thank you so much.

588
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,840
You know what they say?

589
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:23,820
i don't know what they say saying saying that you're like a size 43 in the us is like saying is like when when guys say that they're six foot yeah i'm six foot i'm six foot one yeah

590
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:44,260
12 and freedom mutants i don't even actually know actually now that i think about it i don't sizes at all because all I care about is my own.

591
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,700
Wait a second.

592
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,120
I don't even know.

593
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,860
Because there's also different sizes for men and women, right?

594
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:04,160
So like, if you were to say I'm a men size 7, I'd be like, is that big?

595
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,280
Like, is that a...

596
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,600
Be like, oh yeah, that sounds big.

597
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,460
Do you also buy your shoes in the kids section?

598
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,800
Yeah, because it's cheaper.

599
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,820
Men's size 7 is small.

600
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,440
Oh, my bud.

601
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,560
Really love to welcome the Mint Cafe.

602
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,600
Men's 7 is like a women's 9.

603
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,980
Why don't they just all make it one size?

604
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,080
Like...

605
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:54,380
Well, I guess they maybe wouldn't make size is my size in quote-unquote men's shoes.

606
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,840
Why do they have to segregate it, though?

607
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,640
Why do they have to make it different so that it makes me confusing?

608
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:04,400
Why do I have to be like a men's seven is a woman's nine?

609
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,140
That's so confusing.

610
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,460
It's one size in Europe.

611
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,980
Oh, my gosh.

612
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,960
America's always got to be different.

613
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,820
America's got to have.

614
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,640
America's got to have our individuality.

615
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:25,180

There's no rush.

645
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:48,970
Don't worry.

646
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,700

No, the slippers are not...

655
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,810
No, only the signed exclusive is part of the bundle.

656
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,650

Oh, they are US-sized.

660
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:30,790
The shirts.

661
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:35,710
I'm being told information literally as it drops.

662
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,860
If you get the bundle, please do not super chat me.

663
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,960
The bundle was so much money, please.

664
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,420
Please don't super chat.

665
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,220

Hippie!

670
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,500
Oh, I can't wait to see everybody get their stuff.

671
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,900
Oh, stop!

672
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,300
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!

673
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,480
I can't turn all super chats in, though.

674
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,140
I tried to quote Asala and Google A my super chat.

675
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:29,960
No!

676
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:31,880
Which idea for the future?

677
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,260
What about some freak phantom sunglasses?

678
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,420
I have thought about that.

679
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,060

Yesterday was so much fun.

712
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:16,130
Have you read the description on the slippers?

713
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,350
Uh, no?

714
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:22,470
Freight.

716
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:30,810
Yes.

01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,420

Read the plush description.

722
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,470
What are they writing here?

723
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,080
Smug, super deformed, possibly evil!

724
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,600
It might be, actually.

725
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,300
It's like Tiny Minto.

726
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,820
It's pretty evil.

727
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,180
Tis light in the evening.

728
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,020

729
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:21,380

Oh, she is cursed.

738
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,900

01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,040

818
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,160
What do you say to one last birthday showdown?

819
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,280
Acelots are proud creatures.

820
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,840
They never let their prey escape.

821
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:45,340
Ah!

822
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,460

But I won't forget it.

830
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:18,350

Before I read the Woo-Yam Baby, I was like, Oh, let me turn the music back on.

01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:25,400

Oh, it's such a cute setup.

866
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,710
Thank you.

867
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,690
Wait, I've never seen this plushie before.

868
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,050
This is so cute.

869
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:53,190
I'm glad everybody liked Kiara thumbs up in me while I tried to

870
01:15:59,190 --> 01:15:59,650
keep...

871
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:02,430
Kiwa hanging out with Kiwa was always so fun.

872
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,570
Yeah, yeah.

873
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,180
Oh, yeah.

874
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,520

875
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:22,250
Hey.

876
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,570
Hey, don't screenshot that.

877
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:28,070
Don't screenshot this.

878
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:31,210
And...

879
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:32,430
And...

880
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:34,550
And post it!

881
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:35,610
Don't do that!

882
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,040

883
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,320

01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,080

887
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,520
More properly, I want to go through and...

888
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,340
I was getting a Kiwawa behind me.

889
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:07,840
This.

890
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:15,860
I see the car crash and I immediately know what comes following.

891
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,340

895
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,470

896
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,690

Ugh.

But thank you!

900
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,160
Yeah,

901
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,110
it's a really spicy cough drop!

902
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,880
It's the cough drops fault!

903
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,320
Not

904
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:50,690
crying because I'm so happy it's the cough drops fault!

905
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:57,450
It's so spicy!

906
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,690
Oh my gosh!

907
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:12,160
This one's funny.

908
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,080
She's such a sexy lady.

909
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,460
Oh yeah!

910
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,240
The background art.

911
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,900
A long, long time ago I asked for people who would...

912
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,900
Let me use their art for something.

913
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:32,200
It was this!

914
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,980
So thank you!

915
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,560
Thank you, thank you for letting me use your art.

916
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:43,590
Yes!

917
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:45,390
Oh,

918
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,330
so cute!

919
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:51,650
So cute.

920
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:52,450
Oh my god!

921
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:53,050
No!

922
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:55,910
What is with these edits?

923
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:57,110
On my face.

924
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:57,930
No?

925
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:02,430
This one I look so mysterious and spooky.

926
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,550
I really like this.

927
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:07,310
Wait, I really like this picture.

928
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:08,690
So, look at my...

929
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,770
Why are her hands like that?

930
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:12,770
I look so spooky and mysterious.

931
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,040
One thing.

932
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,060
Oh my gosh, wait.

933
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,980
The cough drop is actually trying to kill me again.

934
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,380
I spit it out.

935
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:29,900
Um.

936
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:43,960
One thing that was very cool with Toei that you will not find with like other studios.

937
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:58,500
This is the first time I've ever done this was I had like I felt like I was making a video game where I had like a whole rig on my head that recorded my face.

938
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,660
This is a little behind the scenes.

939
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:05,580
So...

940
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:08,040
Um...

941
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,720
Yeah, Kojima moment, real!

942
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:12,780
Um...

943
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,780
And... and I was...

944
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:25,420
So, so if you notice the facial expressions and everything, looking maybe...

945
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:42,420
Like, you know, if you maybe see my eyes dart around or something, everything is picking up everything which you know you don't find that many studios for concerts like this

946
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:54,750
so yeah it was very very cool technology did they scan your thighs

947
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:16,830
yeah I felt it felt very like the whole thing was like super duper professional But it was funny because it reminded me, there was also like a, there was also like a camera of my face, but it was like a GoPro looking camera on my face.

948
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:27,870
And have you ever seen those videos of like cats when they wear the cameras and they like, it's like very close up weird on their face and they're like running around and stuff?

949
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:31,850
That's what it looked like.

950
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,790
Yeah, like 0.5 POV.

951
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:34,910
Yeah, yeah.

952
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,960
There's like, there was just,

953
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,080
yeah, it's all nose of war.

954
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:07,200
Yeah, and it's from like, it was actually, honestly, pretty difficult dancing with it.

955
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:16,960
But every single, every single time you see, like, you know, everything here, I was wearing that big old thing on my head.

956
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:24,760
And recording took about I got there like 10 a.m.

957
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,250
About 12 hours of with it on my head.

958
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:36,370
11, 12 hours?

959
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:40,250
Oh yeah.

960
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,100
I was so, I was so sore.

961
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,200
Yeah, it was a lot going into it.

962
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,680
I think I did take it off for lunch.

963
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,480
But...

964
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,160
Uh...

965
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,120
I'm still letting you know we got that bundle.

966
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,320
Thank you!

967
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:09,880
Thank you, thank you.

968
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:17,060
But again, like I said, I really wanted it to be as good as it could be, so...

969
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,700
I always push through that kind of stuff.

970
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,140
To...

971
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:23,860
In one session?

972
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,220
Yep.

973
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:27,940
Yep, yep, yep.

974
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:32,860
So...

975
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:33,720
You know.

976
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:36,580
And...

977
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,440
Um...

978
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,460
Even...

979
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,060
Even by the end...

980
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:43,180
I remember I was so...

981
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:43,840
Exhausted.

982
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,880
I was so, so tired.

983
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:48,340
But...

984
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,500
But as soon as like a music would start...

985
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,080
I would be like...

986
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

987
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,840
Like, I would like be dead.

988
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,720
And then the music would start and be like...

989
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,060
I would just want to run around and everything.

990
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:14,320
so yeah I did my best to have have as much of an exciting performance as possible

991
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:28,720
that's me oh wait this one's so cute too it's like I'm a princess oh yes I'm waving at my constituents

992
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,260
After I put it, it was very clear.

993
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,460
I can't, I mean, everybody says, like, you know, it looks so great.

994
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:45,600
But that, that, you know, I, that wasn't me.

995
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,380
So I can't take so much, I can't really take any of that credit.

996
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,860
Honestly, the production team, they busted their butts.

997
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,680
They made it look amazing.

998
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:03,180
And so, yeah, honestly, they did a great job.

1042
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,360

1043
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:07,160

1044
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:14,660
That's so funny to make a cover of my cute cute cute cute cute little Friday night.

1045
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,840

1048
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,610

01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:33,470
Yeah, Borgger, Borgger.

1050
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:35,590
What a sick change she's got.

1051
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,650
We need a cute music video.

1052
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:39,730
I made it!

1053
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:41,530
Actually, I can't...

1054
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:43,210
So, the issue is...

1055
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:47,610
The issue is, I can't upload it because I made it...

1056
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:51,290
I did the music video during that stream in real time.

1057
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:54,330
It was me pushing buttons.

1058
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:57,370
So...

1059
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:58,250
I can't...

1060
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:00,350
I can't upload it.

1061
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:03,090
Because I was doing it.

1062
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,850
So, yeah, I can't...

1063
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,150
I have no way to upload it.

1064
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:19,270
I would have to, like, take it from the stream.

1065
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:26,780
Cute.

1066
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,760

01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:46,690
You guys, we have to listen to this too.

1258
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:49,070
Because I don't have my...

1259
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:49,810
I don't have...

1260
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:50,750
I don't have...

1261
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:52,850
I don't have V set up.

1262
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:53,870

1263
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:55,450

Congratulations, happy birthday with salutations.

1267
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:20,830
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

1268
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:27,310
Happy birthday to you.

1269
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:34,050
I like it afterwards when they're just awkwardly standing around like,

1270
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:45,170
Because it just didn't record lines or something.

1271
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:46,930
Yay!

1272
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:48,530
Thank you!

1273
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:50,090
Thank you!

1274
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:52,110
Thank you, all my little men.

1275
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:54,790
Oh yeah, I'm quiet.

1276
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:55,870
That's her thing too.

1277
01:52:59,190 --> 01:53:00,190
Yeah, that's me.

1278
01:53:00,330 --> 01:53:00,830
That's me.

1279
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,250
YouTube's gonna get mad at me.

1280
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:08,890
I don't know what I'm singing here.

1281
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:10,570
But thank you.

1282
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,010
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1283
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:15,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1284
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,100
Oh!

1285
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,020
Toured into my stream?

1286
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,520
Wait, this is kind of insane.

1287
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:44,610
What?

1288
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:48,490
Oh!

1289
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:50,350
Oh!

1290
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:08,900
Skeletor!

1291
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:11,820
This is so awesome.

1292
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:15,460
You got games on your codec?

1293
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:19,940
Nothing here yet.

1294
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:26,020
Oh, they're gonna add games!

1295
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,200
Wow!

1296
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,000
Wow, wow, wee!

1297
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:34,700
So cool!

1298
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,880
So, so cool!

1299
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,800
Oh my gosh!

1300
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,560
Wait, this is so stinking cute!

1301
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1302
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:41,820
Thank you!

1303
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,660
What is this?

1304
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:48,000
Wait.

1305
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:51,500
Sorry, I keep pausing for videos.

1306
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:53,580
Wait, can I play this?

1307
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:54,300
Or am I gonna...

1308
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:56,160
Ah!

1309
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:07,560

1310
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:15,210

1313
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:15,470
I have

1314
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,930
to make one next to it with my original song, okay?

1315
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:30,860
Door is stuck?

1316
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:45,560
This is so great.

1317
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:56,150
Wait!

1318
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:10,580
This goes so hard though.

1319
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:36,350
Oh my gosh!

1320
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:04,590
I like how they just like tense up and drop.

1321
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:05,490
It's so funny.

1322
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:15,930
I love just the song too.

1323
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:33,180
Good edit.

1324
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:33,760
Yeah!

1325
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:36,120
It is such a catchy song.

1326
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:37,300
It's so stinking cute.

1327
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,340
Oh!

1328
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:41,860
Oh my gosh!

1329
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:44,100
Her fire!

1330
01:58:58,110 --> 01:58:58,930
That was awesome.

1331
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:01,130
We have this too.

1332
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,110
I'm kind of scared though.

1333
01:59:02,330 --> 01:59:02,950
Oh gosh.

1334
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:03,910
Wait.

1335
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:06,630
I'm kind of scared to...

1336
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:09,350
I'm kind of scared to listen to this one though.

1337
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:10,970
Wait!

1338
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:14,670
Two Han points says.

1339
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:16,630
I'm kind of scared.

1340
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:17,610
Let's do fart.

1341
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:19,410
We'll do... 45.

1342
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:20,370
What did I say?

1343
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:21,670
I didn't say fart.

1344
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:22,410
Did I?

1345
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:24,930
That's another thing.

1346
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:27,210
I need to preserve my voice.

1347
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:29,250
Why'd you call me a pervert?

1348
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:30,810
No, I said preserve.

1349
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:32,190
Wait, what did I say?

1350
01:59:35,670 --> 01:59:37,510
Aw, man, I want to keep licking.

1351
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:38,530
Not licking.

1352
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:40,150
Pick.

1353
01:59:43,150 --> 01:59:44,370
I'm really good at this.

1354
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:45,690
Why is it just...

1355
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:58,140
What do you mean full compilation?

1356
01:59:58,340 --> 02:00:02,260
If it's longer, there's more than just a minute.

1357
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:13,150
The full compilation is 16.

1358
02:00:16,610 --> 02:00:17,490
What?

1359
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:18,590
Hold on.

1360
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:22,190
No way.

1361
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:27,410
How is it 16 minutes long?

1362
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:32,300
Hold on.

1363
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:32,780
I'm just going to go.

1364
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,720
Go into the middle.

1365
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:34,740
It works, you guys.

1366
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:37,980
I literally combined cult.

1367
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:39,780
So I said gult.

1368
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:40,360
Wait.

1369
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:42,720
Because I said government and cult.

1370
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:49,140
Are you like full Mac, full ranked up?

1371
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:50,040
Wait, what?

1372
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:51,820
Full Mac.

1373
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:52,500
What?

1374
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,260
Did I say that?

1375
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,440
Oh, my bad.

1376
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:55,980
Full Mac.

1377
02:00:58,580 --> 02:00:59,220
What?

1378
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:01,940
I never realized it either.

1379
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,560
I didn't mess up.

1380
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:05,860
I just went full max.

1381
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:06,680
I just...

1382
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:07,840
I just...

1383
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:10,160
No!

1384
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:11,540
I'm holding the pocket watch.

1385
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,100
In one hand, he clambers atop the pyre and raises his skull.

1386
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:16,600
Not skulls.

1387
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,200
I guess.

1388
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:20,660
No!

1389
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:22,840
Why do I do this so often?

1390
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:26,500
The amount of times you try to deny it.

1391
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:30,660
I feel like I...

1392
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,040
Get gaslit!

1393
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:34,020
I don't know...

1394
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:43,250
Raises his skull.

1395
02:01:43,810 --> 02:01:44,830
What's this one?

1396
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:46,630
Why are transformers even?

1397
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:47,190
Back attack!

1398
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:48,850
Oh, wait, where's the back shot?

1399
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:49,430
Where's the back?

1400
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:51,050
Oh, never mind!

1401
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:57,700
Okay.

1402
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:01,220
Anyway.

1403
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:03,560
What else?

1404
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:04,480
No!

1405
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,400
The let's do fart one kills me.

1406
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:17,510
This one, it kills me though.

1407
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:18,910
Wait, where did I say it?

1408
02:02:19,390 --> 02:02:20,770
Wait, what did I say here?

1409
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:22,310
Oh, D for DJ.

1410
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:24,330
That's not me messing up.

1411
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:26,170
I just didn't think about it.

1412
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:26,590
Oh, here.

1413
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:27,970
Is this the Let's Do fart?

1414
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:31,610
Wait, what did I say?

1415
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:32,770
Oh my god.

1416
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:34,350
It's the Polari the Plari.

1417
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:35,830
Not Plari.

1418
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:38,070
It's the Plari the Plata Boys.

1419
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:57,420
It's Plata Boys.

1420
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:00,040
Thank you.

1421
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,460
What is this?

1422
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:02,060
What is this?

1423
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:02,380
Okay.

1424
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:04,820
I blame you for getting this song stuck in my head.

1425
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:05,760
What's the song, though?

1426
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:08,960
Oh, it's this one.

1427
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,080
I remember that song.

1428
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:21,220
Ah.

1429
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:23,100
Yay.

1430
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,430
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1431
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:29,090
Oh, so cute.

1432
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:30,230
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1433
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:32,210
Thank you.

1434
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:33,410
That's me.

1435
02:03:34,170 --> 02:03:35,050
Wait, that's Barry.

1436
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:43,850
What the hell?

1437
02:03:44,230 --> 02:03:45,070
That's my friend.

1438
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:53,710
What the hell?

1439
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:09,700
Had

1440
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:16,800
to pick between the bundle and the new LEGO's Death Star!

1441
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:18,420
A bit of

1442
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:26,720
taking!

1443
02:04:27,180 --> 02:04:28,780
And they're not inviting me!

1444
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:31,540
Where's mine?

1445
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:32,820
Thank you!

1446
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:33,300
Thank you!

1447
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:33,940

1449
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:36,900

02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:34,480

1461
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,120

02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:39,420

Thank you, thank you.

1464
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:43,560

02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:49,140
What shirt am I wearing?

1468
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:50,740
Hell.

1469
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:53,920
What a batch of...

1470
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:54,480
Oh, music.

1471
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,480
A brookie suffice.

1472
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:57,900
What's a brookie?

1473
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,560
Oh my gosh, me hugging Ocelot.

1474
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:05,760
Just got home from a business trip.

1475
02:06:05,820 --> 02:06:06,100

1476
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,060

1477
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:13,040
Oh, this is a Kiwawa.

1478
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,800
This is during Kiwawa's.

1479
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:16,540
Yeah.

1480
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:18,180
Thank you, thank you, everybody.

1481
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:19,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1482
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1485
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:29,910
Friends!

1486
02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:32,630
Oh, my friend!

1487
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:34,530
Oh, even...

1488
02:06:34,530 --> 02:06:37,210
Actually, Maple drew the, um...

1489
02:06:37,210 --> 02:06:39,910
The wisps for, uh, the concert.

1490
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:42,510
So...

1491
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:42,770
Mmm.

1492
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:49,740
A brookie is a cookie combined with a brownie.

1493
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,040
Oh, wait, that sounds awesome.

1494
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:52,340
I would like that, yes.

1495
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:56,260
Yeah.

1496
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:02,600
So, I'm having them there too!

1497
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:08,540
And my boys in my lap.

1498
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:10,920
This is like everything I love in one photo.

1499
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:13,760
Thank you!

1500
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:15,380
Thank you so much.

1501
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:19,640
Wow, this cake looks insane!

1502
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:21,380
Holy moly!

1503
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:22,740
Thank you so much!

1504
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:24,960
Oh my gosh, and you got the Lego!

1505
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:26,860
Not Lego, mythical brick.

1506
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:31,440
Thank you, thank you.

1507
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:32,620
That's me.

1508
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:34,800
Old me.

1509
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:36,300
Me!

1510
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:37,840
Oh,

1511
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:41,740

1512
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:47,820
Happy birthday people!

1513
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:51,000
Thank

1514
02:07:58,030 --> 02:08:00,370

1515
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:04,470
I saw you guys were doing this, oh my god!

1516
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:06,110
Thank you!

1517
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:10,930
So wholesome, yeah.

1518
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:13,530
Well, the people who got together.

1519
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:15,550
Thank you.

1520
02:08:16,150 --> 02:08:18,070
So cute, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1521
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:18,870
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1522
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:19,450
There's so many posts.

1523
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:20,410
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1524
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:21,970
Oh, that's my butt.

1525
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:25,930
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1526
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:27,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1527
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:30,370
Whoa, this box.

1528
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:32,470
Wait, the new box looks insane.

1529
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:34,890
Holy cow.

1530
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:35,870
Ah!

1531
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:39,250
Good!

1532
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:47,520
I will spare listening on stream.

1533
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:48,460
Thank you!

1534
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:49,380
What the heck?

1535
02:08:53,150 --> 02:08:54,410
I still have my other box.

1536
02:08:55,530 --> 02:08:56,770
The original box.

1537
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:58,270
Thank you so much!

1538
02:08:58,410 --> 02:08:59,250
Oh my god!

1539
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:00,290
Oh my god!

1540
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:08,320
Whoa!

1541
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:14,200
Remix!

1542
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,040
I want to hear it.

1543
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:17,120
Oh!

1544
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:17,380
Oh!

1545
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,320
Oh, there we go.

1546
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:20,920
We're fine.

1547
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:24,420
I want to hear.

1548
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:25,820
Adjust your volume.

1549
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,380
I am.

1550
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:35,620
Oh, my gosh.

1551
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,840
It's long even.

1552
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:54,840
Faster.

1553
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:56,280
Faster.

1554
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:58,140
Thank you!

1555
02:10:58,460 --> 02:10:59,820
Thank you so much!

1556
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:01,640
I will try and use it in the future.

1557
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:03,500
Thank you!

1558
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:05,600
Wow, this looks so yummy!

1559
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:06,860
Thank you!

1560
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:09,820
Oh, thank you, thank you!

1561
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:10,520
Oh, this is me.

1562
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,940
We reached the top.

1563
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:16,320
Thank you!

1564
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:21,000
Thank you, thank you, everybody!

1565
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:22,380

02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:25,120
Thank you for posting the screenshots and everything!

1567
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,940
Really, really appreciate it.

1568
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:29,360
Don't look at my skirt.

1569
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:31,940
Thank you!

1570
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:37,410
I'm out and busy, but I feel like the hard-making- AHHHHH!

1571
02:11:37,550 --> 02:11:37,910

Ah, thank you!

1577
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,950
What the hell?

1578
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,060

02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:17,230
Um...

Even though they were so much?

1590
02:13:22,450 --> 02:13:25,090

But thank you!

1597
02:13:45,470 --> 02:13:47,770
Oh my gosh, I didn't think actually it would sell out though.

1598
02:13:52,790 --> 02:13:54,310
I didn't think it would sell out.

1599
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:57,650
Because it was so expensive.

1600
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:27,540
40 hours editing, oh my gosh!

1601
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:29,760

02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:31,160
So, so don't worry.

02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:33,280

1630
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:49,110

1633
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:36,750
So I'm glad I ended up being good and I'm glad that I could end up having merch for you guys too and

1634
02:19:53,930 --> 02:20:16,470
I hope that I hope that I hope that from here on out it's well there's I hope all the tough stuff is behind us and from here on out It can be much, much more fun times instead.

1635
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:25,570
Now we're past all this silly stuff.

1636
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:28,910
And we'll just keep moving forward.

1637
02:20:30,610 --> 02:20:31,850
And I'll keep working harder.

1638
02:20:32,430 --> 02:20:37,370
And there is actually some very cool stuff planned in the future.

1639
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:40,790
So, actually...

1640
02:20:40,810 --> 02:20:47,910
Yeah, actually, I do have stuff not announced yet, too, so many, many cool things coming up.

1641
02:20:52,210 --> 02:20:54,590
So, you can look forward to that, too.

1642
02:20:56,870 --> 02:20:58,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1643
02:20:58,730 --> 02:21:00,490
It's all coming up, Mickey, from here.

1644
02:21:02,430 --> 02:21:03,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1645
02:21:04,050 --> 02:21:06,430
So, there's still more cool stuff around the corner.

1646
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:10,770
And, you know, I got more cons.

1647
02:21:10,810 --> 02:21:11,490
coming up.

1648
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:20,810
I have the Idol Festival at the end of this month, and I have Holiday Matsuri in December and even other things.

1649
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:23,190
Um, what?

1650
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:33,430
Some things will are happening, but won't be until later.

1651
02:21:35,210 --> 02:21:35,830
Yeah,

1652
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:40,580
Club Iron Mouse too!

1653
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:41,760
Yes, yes, yes, thank you.

1654
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:43,700
Yes, yes, yes.

1655
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:45,540
That was announced recently as well.

1656
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:47,660
Caught the 3D debut by this morning.

1657
02:21:47,860 --> 02:21:48,720
Thank you!

1658
02:21:51,540 --> 02:21:52,940
Yeah, Hollow Hunger.

1659
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:55,160
I thought it was kind of spooky.

1660
02:21:57,660 --> 02:21:58,660
Happy birthday, Mickey.

1661
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,240
Thank you!

1662
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:01,160
Thank you so much, you guys.

1663
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:02,540
Thank you!

1664
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:05,140
It's mean we can have 3D streams now.

1665
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:11,080
I have a couple things that I'm trying to get what's the word?

1666
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,540
Ironed out with my 3D model.

1667
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:48,090
but once that is the case then yeah 3d streams yeah yeah sorted out a couple things so but but yeah there's there's actually there's some really cool stuff but some stuff i think it's cool i think it's cool hopefully you guys think it's cool too so some of it one thing It's like,

1668
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:52,830
if it happens, it's like, it's like bragging rights.

1669
02:22:57,050 --> 02:23:05,130
So, it's kind of crazy that I still am offered some of these things as, even as an indie.

1670
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:12,510
I feel really, really, really lucky.

1671
02:23:14,410 --> 02:23:16,690
Even if this year has been unlucky.

1672
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:21,250
It's been unlucky and lucky at the same time.

1673
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:24,630
You know, I don't want to just always be...

1674
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:28,330
You know, the...

1675
02:23:28,330 --> 02:23:35,570
The B-Shoujo thing was, you know, a pretty big loss on my end, you know.

1676
02:23:36,490 --> 02:23:41,410
There was some really big things that all fell through.

1677
02:23:41,810 --> 02:23:44,410
Luckily, the concert still made it through, but...

1678
02:23:44,410 --> 02:23:47,230
There was one other thing that fell through that I was...

1679
02:23:48,270 --> 02:24:18,290
really really excited for but at the same time I've also been able to do so much and we'll keep and I keep being able to do so much so I don't want to just be thinking about that all the time and I don't I don't even if you don't think I do you might be like oh she's coping no no I I also,

1680
02:24:19,030 --> 02:24:28,370
I try to move on and, you know, if I stay too much on the past, then I would just be so sad all the time.

1681
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:30,170
So, I don't want to be sad.

1682
02:24:30,310 --> 02:24:41,790
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be someone that you can watch and be like, wow, she's so goofy.

1683
02:24:47,290 --> 02:25:43,510
happy after hard day work so you know that's what that's always my number one goal for you guys is to is to have a fun time hmm yes yes I do I do all the sad stuff behind the scenes so that you guys can have fun on the street but fun times ahead i'm i'm hopeful for i'm hopeful for the future so thank you guys i'm gonna call it here today's stream was fun it made me happy even though it was just me yapping sorry i didn't have so much plan for today but I think the concert yesterday was a lot,

1684
02:25:43,530 --> 02:25:43,870
so...

1685
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:47,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1686
02:25:51,310 --> 02:25:52,770
Thank you guys, thank you.

1687
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,200
Thank you!

1688
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:11,340
Proud of you putting together such an incredible 3D debut, despite more than your share of setbacks this year.

1689
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,600
I'm sorry that I'm a little...

1690
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:16,140
bit of unlucky.

1691
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:18,980
If you...

1692
02:26:18,980 --> 02:26:20,620
If I'm your Oshi, I'm sorry.

1693
02:26:20,980 --> 02:26:21,580
If...

1694
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,740
You picked such an unlucky Oshi.

1695
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:27,160
My luck is very strange.

1696
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:29,880
It swings in such directions, I think.

1697
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:34,140
I'm either zero luck or a hundred luck, maybe.

1698
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:40,080
It's very dramatic.

1699
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:42,640
And never in between.

1700
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:47,120
You're awesome.

1701
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:48,240
Never let anyone say otherwise.

1702
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:49,020
Thank you.

1703
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:51,140
Thank you so much.

1704
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:53,320
Come on!

1705
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:01,920
But...

1706
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,220
Um...

1707
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:05,640
But I feel...

1708
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:07,200
I feel the most lucky.

1709
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:15,960
Even if I'm unlucky sometimes, I still feel the most lucky ever in the world, so...

1710
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:17,120
Yeah.

1711
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:18,900
And I won't go to Vegas.

1712
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:28,000
Thank you so, so, so much.

1713
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:30,240
Thank you.

1714
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:39,200
Uh...

1715
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:42,960
Hmm...

1716
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:49,360
You're pretty good.

1717
02:27:53,740 --> 02:27:55,460
Maybe New Vegas?

1718
02:28:00,580 --> 02:28:02,020
New Vegas.

1719
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:03,060
What's New Vegas?

1720
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:05,340
I can make my own Vegas.

1721
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:10,220
Okay, you guys, I'm going to make my own Vegas with blackjack and hookers.

1722
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:16,880
And then it'll be called New Vegas.

1723
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:20,280
Oh, wait, that's Fallout.

1724
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:22,140
Okay,

1725
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:26,460
hold on.

1726
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,300
It will be called.

1727
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:40,480
This stole my idea.

1728
02:28:41,020 --> 02:28:42,820
How is that different from current Vegas?

1729
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:45,040
Because I own a

1730
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:52,680
house always wins.

1731
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:56,260
Pinky always wins.

1732
02:28:57,400 --> 02:28:57,680
Yeah.

1733
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:04,590
We'll call it Las Vegas 2.

1734
02:29:09,810 --> 02:29:11,730
Las Vegas 2, New Vegas.

1735
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:25,280
Two Las 2 Vegas.

1736
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:27,360
Outer Vegas.

1737
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:38,900
Wait, can my Vegas also have the giant sphere that nobody likes?

1738
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:40,700
Can I also?

1739
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:45,220
Can I also do that?

1740
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:50,180
Can you talk us through your creative process for the ghost-made Kyusha mix?

1741
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:53,960
A few words, oomps, that are still trying to decipher.

1742
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:54,900
Ah!

1743
02:29:56,720 --> 02:30:01,620
Um, honestly, the lyrics were entirely Panda Boy.

1744
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:06,520
And they were so perfect that...

1745
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:10,240
I told them that I did want, like, a mix that I wanted World Chaos in it.

1746
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:12,460
And...

1747
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:13,700
He did it.

1748
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,980
And then he was kind of just like...

1749
02:30:16,580 --> 02:30:17,080
What...

1750
02:30:17,660 --> 02:30:18,160
What...

1751
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,380
What kind of things do you like?

1752
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:24,840
And I was like...

1753
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:25,760
Metal Gear?

1754
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:28,100

1755
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:32,100
Even though you're pretty good?

1756
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:33,000

1758
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:36,620
He kind of...

1759
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:37,800
He kind of...

1760
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:41,300
It was him!

1761
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:42,160

02:34:04,480 --> 02:34:05,920
Like the blankets.

1799
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:08,280
Like the ruffled of the blanket.

1800
02:34:08,540 --> 02:34:09,340
But I remember!

1801
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:13,660
I remember this happened literally five years ago.

1802
02:34:16,420 --> 02:34:26,310
Yeah, like the blanket po- I posted it with very wholesome intentions and everyone had this.

02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:34,980
The same reaction.
