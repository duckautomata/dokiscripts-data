1
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,240
The music is killing me.

2
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,180
The birds.

3
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,800
Peppeloni.

4
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,500
Peppeloni.

5
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,320
How am I supposed to prepare for your live if you do not tweet in one hour?

6
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,700
Sorry!

7
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,760
It's because I...

8
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,240
This is a lie that keeps receiving...

9
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,440
I was busy today and I forgot to make a waiting room and then I forgot to...

10
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,380
Well, I made the waiting room and then I forgot to...

11
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,620
Uh, tweet in one hour.

12
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,740
Oopsie!

13
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,320
I...

14
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,400
You always were a kid or me too.

15
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,220
But moment.

16
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,180
Bye bye.

17
00:06:10,100 --> 00:07:00,880

19
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:18,200
hmm Cold equals the same.

20
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,400
That's a problem.

21
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,460
That's a big problem.

22
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,480
Actually, I have some candy.

23
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Hold on.

24
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:40,740
I met a friend from the Yokei, and she gave me some chocolate.

25
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,720
Cadbury dairy milk buttons.

26
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
Orange flavor.

27
00:07:50,900 --> 00:08:21,740
and they're really good I've been trying not to eat all of them immediately I mean I've had them for over a month now but still not over a month oh wait maybe yeah they are so yummy though Cadbury buttons are always peak are there other flavors I like the orange I like orange chocolate so I'm a big fan of this.

28
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,760
Hey, peace!

29
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
Welcome back to membership.

30
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,860
Thank you.

31
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,660
Thank you.

32
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,280
Um, do we know this British friend?

33
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,800
No.

34
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,900
It's not Vicky.

35
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,500
No.

36
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,780
Who else do I know that's British?

37
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,460
Limu, no.

38
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,200
I was supposed to meet Limu this weekend, actually.

39
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,320
I was...

40
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,060

44
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,240
I'm so curious.

45
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,640
Was it the ghost of the queen?

46
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,320
Oh my gosh.

47
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,540
Stop lying, Minky.

48
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,860
All British people are VTubers.

49
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,580
I don't know about that.

50
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,560
We would have more EU streamers then, right?

51
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,180
Oh, Limu.

52
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeah, I was supposed to meet Limu this weekend.

53
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,580
At least that was like the plan.

54
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,100
I don't know if she knows that or not.

55
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:30,100
So don't be going to live movie and like hey what happened with your plans with me though i think i kind of decided is

56
00:10:37,130 --> 00:11:01,350
that like caramel and milk but um this weekend uh was i was going to be going to the uk to go see metal gear and concert i was so excited i was really excited but i was like i'm then then some other things happened started popping up in November and I was like,

57
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:15,370
I can't travel anymore because I'm already traveling so much in November so I decided against it and so then I could I could be here and also, you know, US Idol Festival and everything

58
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:36,790
but yeah you should have gone I feel like it was way too much time that i was not streaming so hopefully hopefully the concert decides to come to the us then i can go to that

59
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:57,030
ended up falling asleep last night after all good i had spooky dreams good also there are mint flavored chocolate buttons they're not bad hmm i think though i don't know if i would like them more than the orange, I'll be honest.

60
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,790
Welcome back to Membership Sanku!

61
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,990
I love my noodle arms.

62
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,130
Oh, you love...

63
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,910
Wait, I love your noodle arms.

64
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,410
Is this a code?

65
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,210
Why is...

66
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,690
Why are there spaces?

67
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,850
Okay.

68
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:56,230
but yeah so maybe one day i will go to the great city of london and go to that shrek land and oh what's the ferris wheel called maybe one day i will okay i feel like though if i go to europe for the first time i want to go to austria first so that i can go see kiwawa but The London Eye.

69
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,870
So creepy.

70
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,030
So creepy.

71
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,430
Yeah.

72
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,550
Yeah, I gotta go to Australia.

73
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,850
Got to see Fleet Street?

74
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,450
The daemon Bob were on Fleet Street.

75
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,610
Kiwawa might drag you to Maldives?

76
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,230
Maldives?

77
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,210
Is that how you pronounce it?

78
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:32,930
Hmm.

79
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,510
Oh yeah, you know.

80
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:44,290
Obviously, I'm trying not to plan so much travel right now, though, because my upcoming months are kind of insane, so...

81
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,570
My upcoming months are kind of insane.

82
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,870
Some of it having to do with checking out places for me and moving.

83
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:55,970
So...

84
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,050
Yes!

85
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,790
Yeah!

86
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,930
One day, one day I'll move.

87
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,510
One day I'll move.

88
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,650
Get out of my moldy mid-cafe.

89
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,430
And find a new mid-cafe, the haunt.

90
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,510
Yeah, lots have been going on behind the scenes.

91
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,270
A lot has been going, actually so much has been going on behind the scenes!

92
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,130
I hope that you guys can look forward to a lot of the stuff that has been cooking.

93
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,810
in the background that will all be revealed eventually.

94
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,530
But today we play more Harvester,

95
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,590
which, does anybody know what's going on in this game?

96
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,830
I don't know if I will be able to beat the game today, but I would like to try.

97
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,810
I do have some stuff I need to do tonight.

98
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,110
11 p.m.

99
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,650
EST.

100
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,470
So, I have until then.

101
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,610
I'm happy that you're finally working on moving.

102
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,190
It's definitely more healthy for you.

103
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,910
Thank you!

104
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:13,810
Yeah!

105
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,010
So, what?

106
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,630
Okay, let's see.

107
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,530
I like these, these kind of...

108
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,190
The way that I...

109
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,330
Name these.

110
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,790
I like we have chapter 10, Jimmy James.

111
00:15:27,810 --> 00:16:03,170
chapter 11 death of jimmy james what does scratch mean i don't know why did i manhole okay i get oh this was scratching the car i think um like bees okay that was the hornet lady i get that application okay the application to the to the lodge get pranked wait scratch Thank you for that gift and I've never seen anybody change their profile picture more than you.

112
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,670
Your save game names are almost as nonsensical as Joel's were in his playthrough years back.

113
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,730
Maybe because you have to be a little nonsensical to play this.

114
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,150
Pepperoni though.

115
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,470
Why did I name it pepperoni?

116
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,570
Why didn't I have a pepperoni?

117
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,170
I think it was, probably, if I had to guess.

118
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,490
Probably because of his nipples.

119
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,830
Oh, sorry, my bud.

120
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,290
What I want to, like I said, I want to probably try and beat the game today.

121
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,550
I do have a guide up.

122
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,290
So, not salami.

123
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,310
I was warned.

124
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,610
I think we're on day three, though, so we have quite a bit to get through.

125
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,910
We have quite a bit to get through.

126
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:09,870
Sorry, me.

127
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,370
Oh my gosh, you did it again!

128
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:24,350
If you do visit Austria and then you somehow end up ever touring Eastern Europe, end up in Prague, you could always recreate emptiness for Hax-3.

129
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,810
That's so specific.

130
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,410
That's like the most specific catch moment ever.

131
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,430
Ah, yes.

132
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,330
I'll walk down the streets.

133
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,670
I can't whistle.

134
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,170
Yeah, I'll do that while stalking Kiara.

135
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,030
Wait, no.

136
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,530
She would have to whistle.

137
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,190
Thanks again for my first watching on the cover of the Garibald.

138
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,890
Thank you for hanging out with us.

139
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:04,790
Thank you.

140
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,830
Milky, welcome back to Angu.

141
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,210
Europe.

142
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,570
Hope you decide to come to Ireland at some point.

143
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,070
We have sheep and cows, among other things.

144
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,930
Wow, I like all those things.

145
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:21,910
I want to go.

146
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,570
All right, so yeah, I have my walkthrough.

147
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,150
Let's just get into it.

148
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,390
I have six hours to beat this game.

149
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,250
A little less than.

150
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,170
Right?

151
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,270
Yeah.

152
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,090
Let's try...

153
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,310
Oh, wait.

154
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,310
Pepelone.

155
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,130
Let's hit it.

156
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,130
Okay, we just woke up.

157
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,570
Okay, hold on.

158
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,070
I'm trying to think.

159
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,850
We scratched that guy's car.

160
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,710
But I don't know where we go from here.

161
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,390
Ireland might mention?

162
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,450
Yeah.

163
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,150
I don't know what we do here.

164
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,870
To the lodge?

165
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,470
Look at that baby.

166
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,550
Examine the baby.

167
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,150
A newborn baby is sleeping soundly.

168
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,690
Okay, let's go to the lodge then.

169
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,110
We also killed Jimmy James.

170
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,650
We're so good.

171
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,530
Let's go to the lodge.

172
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,410
Wait, I thought we already told the guy that we scratched his car.

173
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,910
Oh, you have completed your first task now that you've scratched.

174
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,630

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:55,490
Oh The fireman Oh, that's right.

179
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,650

180
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:10,660
I remember him saying this Okay, I'll do it very well then use whatever means necessary but bring the cloth to a healer task.

181
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,200
Okay.

182
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,430
All right, hold on.

183
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,890
I'm going to look a little bit at the walkthrough.

184
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,130
Reward money.

185
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,390
Did we get reward money?

186
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,820
What?

187
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,700
Oh, wait.

188
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,460
No, we're on day three.

189
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:30,860
Just kidding.

190
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,820
Okay.

191
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,720
Sorry, I was reading day four.

192
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,360
My bad.

193
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:39,760
Okay.

194
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,580
All right.

195
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,420
So we got our new task.

196
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,320
Um, we're on day three.

197
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,180

198
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,960
Hi.

199
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,520

Rush, rush.

203
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,500
I love the fire department.

204
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,520
Why do we sometimes hear like a dog getting slapped?

205
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,660
I don't like that.

206
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,540

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,120
Oh, a photorealistic mural of a peaceful countryside.

217
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,900
This is not a window!

218
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,440

Why are they drawing some dude at the fire department, though?

232
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,590
Because they're, they're passing the time until they need to do anything.

233
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,230
Padded shovel marks are visible on this fresh dirt mound.

234
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,790
Do I examine it?

235
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,610
Uh, do I not have a shovel?

236
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,290

240
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,730

241
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,330

259
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,080

260
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,580

Thank god.

277
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,250
What happened?

278
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,190
Found her in the graveyard.

279
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,990
She was buried alive.

280
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,290
He's so serious about it, but no one else is, it feels like.

281
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,390
Thank you, Steve.

282
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,190

284
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,350
Here's the reward money.

285
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,450
Take it to go.

286
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,210
The reward money.

287
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,010
I need to be alone with my baby right now.

288
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,510
What do you mean the reward money?

289
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,890
As if there was a...

290
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,790
As if we knew that she was...

291
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,930
I guess

292
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,010
we got money.

293
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,860
How much money we get?

294
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,260
This is a note.

295
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,680
How much money do I have?

296
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,060
Oh, reward money!

297
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:11,860
Let's go.

298
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,740
Okay.

299
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,260
Oh, sorry.

300
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,680
That's right.

301
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,980
Right click is, like, punching and...

302
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,340
When am I going to start being able to kill things, I wonder?

303
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,380
Okay.

304
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,840
Interesting.

305
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,180
Okay.

306
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Okay, um, all right, hold on.

307
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,200
Get me out of here.

308
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,560
It says we go to the memorial.

309
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,560
What was the beginning?

310
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,340
Oh, that's, uh, the school, right?

311
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,120
Yeah.

312
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,500
So we're gonna use the fire alarm here.

313
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,060
Four more magazines!

314
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,420
Oh, yeah.

315
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,480
Oh, hello.

316
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:33,320

317
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,900
Congratulations on finding Karen Fitzpatrick.

318
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,580
Oh, thank you.

319
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,980
Don't know how you did it, but if I was still publishing the Sentinel, you can bet I'd run a full profile on you.

320
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,020
Wait, I've just realized I scratched the car with my key.

321
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,560
Would there not be evidence of that then, maybe?

322
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,240
Okay, bye.

323
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,680

You told me not to.

326
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,460
Adult education is a wonderful thing.

327
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:19,680
thing as is a dope quality tie the fire alarm okay so what we can do is we pull the fire alarm and that will get the fire department people to leave right

329
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,240
What's that?

330
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,380
Fire axe.

331
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,620
Propped on its side in the back of the garage is a fire axe.

332
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,800
I'll take that.

333
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,220
Yoink.

334
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,620
And, uh, what's this?

335
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,320
A ladder.

336
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:51,780
Yoink.

337
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,940
What else is in here?

338
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,100
Nothing.

339
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,560
Okay, cool.

340
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,440
Um, are they gone?

341
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,160
Oh, I can't even go inside.

342
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,300
Wait, what did I just... Oh, the fence.

343
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,140
Okay.

344
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,960
Uh, wait, what?

345
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,380
How am I supposed to get and steal their thing?

346
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,420
Oh my god, stop hitting the dog!

347
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,480
Yeah, where's the bolt of cloth?

348
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,740
Flowers.

349
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,800
With all the rose...

350
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,780
With all the rose pretty flowers, the firemen must have a ton of time on their hands.

353
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,760

354
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,220

355
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,980

Okay.

357
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,260
I don't want to go to the meat plant.

358
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,660
Okay, people before stream told me about the meat plant.

359
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,680
And so I have a little censor.

360
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,480
I will censor it for you guys.

361
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,080
Unfortunately, I will still unfortunately be able to see it.

362
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,000
But...

363
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,180
Uh...

364
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,120
You guys will...

365
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,260
It'll be censored for you guys, so it won't be so cool.

366
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,760

367
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,980
Do I have to go here?

368
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,680
Yet?

369
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:02,130
I mean... I don't know what else to do.

370
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,110
Okay, I'm looking at the...

371
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,510
I'm gonna... I'm looking at the walkthrough, you guys.

372
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,150
Go home.

373
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,950
Use the furniture dolly on the living room shelves.

374
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:13,950
There's an alarm.

375
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,570
What?

376
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,690
How am I supposed to know that?

377
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,530
Wait, what if I got the frisbee down?

378
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,110
Damn it.

379
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:26,730
Oh, man.

380
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,090
Oh, man.

381
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,430
Okay, it was worth a try.

382
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,790
Okay, so I use it...

383
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,470
I use the furniture dolly.

384
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,570
What furniture dolly?

385
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,050
On the living room shelves.

389
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,890
There are security bars fast into the window.

390
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,610
I'm supposed to know how to figure it out by spending koality.

391
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,690

Let's celebrate!

396
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,510
There's a little gift for me for making my year brighter.

397

398

Oh, my bad.

402
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,610
Thanks for including me.

403
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,570
Sorry, I did something that you guys...

404
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,270
I used the wrong mouse.

405
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,590
Okay, so now we use the Phillips screwdriver on this guy.

406
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,130
You dismantle...

407
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,110
Ooh, what a terrible sound.

408
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,950
You dismantle the bars from the window with the screwdriver.

409
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,250
And we go talk to her dad?

410
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:57,830
Oh!

411
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,880
I don't think I need to censor anything at the moment.

412
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,180
It's just a...

413
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,340
Ah!

414
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,820
Has this been in here the whole time?

415
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,060
Wait, where is... Oh, Dad is just in bed.

416
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,460
Why are the walls covered in blood?

417
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,940
Wait, if I examine the picture, will I get...

418
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,340
Hold on.

419
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,800
I will censor real quick.

420
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Oh, okay.

421
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,000
I thought I would like zoom in, you know?

422
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,720
A screenshot from the movie Rosie Palm meets Rosie cheeks.

423
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,520
So that's your dad, now I know why you are such a freak.

424
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,580
Classic film, classic film.

425
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,080
I mean, those are some prosy cheeks.

426
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,800
Mom's a hello kitty girl, apparently.

427
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,060
What does that mean?

428
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,420
I'm examining the sex toys.

429
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,320
Exotic, kinky love equipment.

430
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,460
No, leave that there.

431
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,380
If any of it turns out missing.

432
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,260
Marv, what's going on in there?

433
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,900
Oh,

434
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,240
go!

435
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,740
Don't talk!

436
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,160
I'm just standing here.

437
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,640
What's this?

438
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,220
This photograph is a constant torture for poor old dad.

439
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,860
What does that mean?

440
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,900
No.

441
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:51,920
No, no!

442
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,300
Oh.

443
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,600
Marv, what's going on in there?

444
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,150
Go.

445
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,370
No!

446
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,150
Shh!

447
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,230
Stop talking!

448
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,770
Okay, I can't examine the sex toys or else...

449
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,030
Oh my god, they're everywhere.

450
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,810
At least she gave him a fan.

451
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,230
I can barely...

452
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,670
I can barely see he's there because he's wrapped in bandages.

453
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,230
Oh my gosh, there's even chains on the ceiling!

454
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,750
This is...

455
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,450
This is a torture chamber!

456
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,970
Um, hi dad.

457
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:28,890
Steve.

458
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,610
Is that you?

459
00:37:32,130 --> 00:38:03,090

460
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,130
I had to break it.

461
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,050
What the hell is going on in here?

462
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,210
The sudden cutscene.

463
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,870
I know it's a mystery to you.

464
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,370
The sacred things that husbands and wives do behind closed doors.

465
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,010
Maybe we should have that special father-son talk.

466
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,630
Especially now that you're getting married.

467
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,210
Is this gonna happen to Steve?

468
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,110
Yeah, I'd like that.

469
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,590
Then listen.

470
00:38:32,330 --> 00:39:08,850
I can't talk very loud it's the tracheotomy tracheotomy what is that something with his throat oh love each other very much they go into a room alone and shut the door and bolt it with at least three locks and prop a chair under the doorknob so no one can get in throat surgery or out Then they take off their clothes and get out a wide variety of scalpels.

471
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:16,450
Some curved, some short, all of them sharp.

472
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,830
And then the man climbs on the woman.

473
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,630
And then they...

474
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,390
With the barbed wire.

475
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,530
Barbed wire!

476
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,270
Where did that come in?

477
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,050
That's all right.

00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,950
No, not this.

483
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,750

484
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:41,470
Yeah.

485
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,450
Um.

486
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,100
Marriage.

487
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,780
Save.

488
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,220
Slip from the meat factory.

489
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,520
I thought I...

491
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,710
I thought I had something.

492
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:05,630
No?

493
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,530
Do I need to go to the factory and get it, maybe?

494
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,250
I thought I remember hearing...

495
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,250
Maybe I'm thinking of a different thing that needed to get signed.

496
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:15,830
Mewage.

497
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,090
Open the door.

498
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,810
It won't let me...

499
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:18,990
Wait.

500
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,750
Yeah, it won't let me actually.

501
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,250
Okay, I think I need to go to...

502
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,510
Under the bat?

503
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:28,710
Unless?

504
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,470
No, that's just a note.

505
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,350
Yeah, I think maybe I have to go...

506
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,210
To the meat plant.

507
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:42,090
Sorry, I'm like following a walkthrough now, but I wasn't last stream, so I'm a little discombobulated.

508
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,490
Alright, guys.

509
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,010
I don't want to be here.

510
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:47,970
This is me.

511
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,150
Okay, apparently it's like the bottom right that is like not good.

512
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,930
So, um, we'll do our best.

513
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,090
We'll do our best here.

514
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,190
I'm just gonna go in.

515
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,470
I'm just gonna go in.

516
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,550
And then...

517
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,830
Yeah, this game is discombobulated.

518
00:42:09,070 --> 00:43:07,510
I'm just gonna go in and hopefully it's censored hopefully okay it's censored oh gosh I'm gonna talk to this guy Steve how's your father is he better uh about the same I guess he's been away from work for weeks and when I call your house your mother won't let me talk to him believe me he's a hard man to see right now this is a fine kettle of fish I must say fish i am glad to see you taking an interest in the business in your dad's absence who are you oh steve i didn't want to believe that amnesia hookham now you're saying you don't remember your pal pat o'reilly okay um i don't i'm not gonna ask about the cats looks like they had some quality time you may come to realize that this business is not for everybody just ask your poor ill dad.

519
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,350
It takes dedication and a strong stomach.

520
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:11,610
Ah!

521
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,230
What the hell was that?

522
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:23,290
A lot of times, when I'm finished scrubbing up and digging the bits of intestine out from my fingernails, I must confess I don't have much appetite for red meat.

523
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,370
That's so fair.

524
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:28,170
But red meat is one of the principal food groups, and you got to have it.

525
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:36,390
So when you can do this all day and help yourself to a juicy red steak afterwards, then by golly, you can call yourself a butcher.

526
00:43:36,910 --> 00:44:37,310
of course amnesia would certainly help that wouldn't it um dad's illness what exactly is wrong with you that's a great question i can't get in to see him he's all cut up lying in bed broken man and i think she did it to him who my so-called mother shame on you trying into what goes on in the sanctity of your parents bedroom you're young you don't a man of the world running the family business a member in good standing of the lodge you'll understand the beauty of what transpires between husbands and wives am i just not an adult do i just not understand the family business you may come to realize that this husband and wife is it because i've never been married i don't understand your dad it takes dedication oh wait i think i did oh oh it doesn't even look like anything a lot of times when i'm finished okay thank you Thank you.

527
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,330
Oh, oh gosh.

528
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,170
I meant to press the... I should have pressed the lodge instead.

529
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,330
Of course, Amni.

530
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:46,350
Uh...

531
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,170
Uh...

532
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:47,970
Uh...

533
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:48,350
Meat?

534
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,990
Come to think of it.

535
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,110
I don't see any cattle around here.

536
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,710
I'm scared to ask this.

537
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,930
Does it matter?

538
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,170
The end product is all the customer cares about, Steve.

539
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,810
You'll get it when you grow up, Minto?

540
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,330
Only the juiciest guy.

541
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:37,570
once you take over the business you realize oh my god no not again please i've seen it enough would the lodge use us to cater their affairs um oh god not the lodge again i'm sure it's good but i have some meat to take home oh your father's very particular about okay here we go no freebies for anyone but seeing how you're here we go here we go here we go written permission from your father i'll give you the meat give me the meat the law Oh wait,

542
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:52,950
so do I did I get the thing for the order of the harvest moon sponsors a weenie roast on the lodge grounds every summer I wonder why heck the best way to find out is to sign up with them They're a great organization Steve.

543
00:45:52,950 --> 00:46:08,690
That's what happens when we miss out on the talk They do what needs to be done and expect nothing in return then how do they support themselves Membership dues from what I hear the work is its own reward Okay, bye.

544
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,830
Don't be such a stranger, Steve.

545
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,250
And my best to your dad.

546
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:13,630
All right, hold on.

547
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,350
Let me see if we got the thing that we...

548
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:16,510
Ah!

549
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,470
Meat permission slip!

550
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,550
Okay, we got it.

551
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,070
We can go.

552
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:20,890
I don't...

553
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,970
I'm scared to see if I could like...

554
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:23,790
Examine the barrels.

555
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,670
Whatever is in these barrels smells extremely bad.

556
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,030
Okay, I can't examine any of the cats.

557
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,170
Oh gosh.

558
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,610
Examine the splotch?

559
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,430
Examine the meat!

560
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,090
I don't want to.

561
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,330
Let's get out of here.

562
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,310
Go, go, go.

563
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,590
Let's go to Papa.

564
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,710
And then we go back into the meat room.

565
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,610
Poor little babies.

566
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,410
Hello, father.

567
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,090
Why is there a hole in his neck?

568
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,510
I need some meat.

569
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,090
And Pat won't give me any without your signed permission.

570
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:34,150
Steve needs some meat huh here son here's my signature take it to him and you won't have any problem now go son go quickly before she comes back the pain can he even write I don't know curly oh

571
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:47,880
no Oh god, what's happening on that ship?

572
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,320
Can we confront our mom?

573
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,440
Let's save and see.

574
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,720
Oh, it won't let me save yet.

575
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,100
Hold on.

576
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,240
Let me go into the meat plant.

577
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,580
We should save, though.

578
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,780
Save game.

579
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,960
I think we're okay to save over this one.

580
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,900
I haven't really done much, so...

581
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,060
Okay.

582
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,460
Yeah, we're going to go confront...

583
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,160
Let's see.

584
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,100
There's a cutscene for your mom entering the bedroom.

585
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,340
It's one of the best in the game.

586
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,440
I was trying to get her to...

587
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,540
Maybe I have to, like...

588
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,140
Okay, let's try.

589
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,060
We did just save, so let's do it.

590
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,220
Maybe if I keep examining the toys.

591
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:31,780
No.

592
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,020
Leave that there.

593
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,920
If any of it turns out missing.

594
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,900
Marv, what's going on in there?

595
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,040
Marv, what's going on in there?

596
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:44,580
Go.

597
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:48,620
No.

598
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:49,800
Okay.

599
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,360
Marv, what's going on in there?

600
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,700
I think it triggers during the night time.

601
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,240
Let me try three times, because, you know, like, that seems like a...

602
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,720
I mean, who knows what this game, honestly, but...

603
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,240
No, leave that there.

604
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,040
If any of it turns out missing.

605
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,800
Your dad, the origin story of the pain.

606
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,300
What's going on in there?

607
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:16,650
Go.

608
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:17,570
Go.

609
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,110
Okay, one last try.

610
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,050
One last time.

611
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,230
I want to hear it.

612
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:24,530
One more.

613
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:24,810
Oh.

614
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:26,430
Oops, I clicked exit!

615
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,510
Okay, I'm stupid.

616
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,250
Sorry, guys.

617
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,410
We'll try at night.

618
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,170
Mar.

619
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,190
What's going on in there?

620
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:34,930
Hello, dear.

621
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:35,970
How are you today?

622
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,930
By the way, I spoke with Mr. Johnson and he's living.

623
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:43,370
Oh my god.

624
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,230
If he finds out who, they'll be hectic.

625
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,510
They'll be hectic.

626
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:47,310
Congratulations, hero.

627
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,790
You found Karen after all.

628
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:51,950
Yeah, why?

629
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,330
I wonder why.

630
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,030
I warned you not to waste time looking for her.

631
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,170
Wait, we definitely skipped something on accident.

632
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,090
The blood drive is coming soon.

633
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,810
What does that have to do with anything?

634
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:04,670
If you haven't joined the lodge by then, you'll find out.

635
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,030
Still, I'm glad you found the poor baby.

636
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:09,970
Yeah, we sequence broke.

637
00:50:12,810 --> 00:51:39,190
what happened to her what a silly little girl I can't well I did say but this is completely different than what I thought we were going to do are the ways of married couples why vtubers are so afraid to say if they're married wait do we need to protect Nimi no I think I think whoever Nimi is marrying is needs to be is the one that needs to be fear is wait is the one who is in trouble there we go I'll say I believe her shame on you imagine accusing your future father-in-law of a thing like that is that how a range rider would behave I don't think so why would she lie okay Wisenheimer even if he is a child molester a kidnapper and an attempted murder that's no reflection on what kind of father-in-law he'll be i just can't wait for the wedding can you oh bye don't forget to put the papers out for jimmy you know how he gets it's kind of it's so it's so creepy that she keeps bringing up jimmy he's gone mom he's gone jimmy james is gone i don't think i want to join this Yeah!

638
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,910
Seems bad, maybe.

639
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,770
Seems maybe not good.

640
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,210
I'm gonna save one more time.

641
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:51,050
Save.

642
00:51:59,150 --> 00:51:59,450
Meat.

643
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:01,350
Meat.

644
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,630
Meaty.

645
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,390
Meaty papers.

646
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,420
Buster just send the missile straight at us.

647
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:55,240

649
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,680
Is Steve still a kidder?

650
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,180
Oh, yes, actually.

651
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,500
We did get the Steve as a kidder.

652
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,800
So now I'm guessing we have to go give this to Nightfall!

653
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,500
Oh, sorry, I just remembered the...

654
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:35,800
There we go.

655
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,440
Sorry, so sorry.

656
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,020
Wait, but...

657
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,280
Am I...

658
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:50,540
Um...

659
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:56,840
Save again.

660
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,760
It's

661
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,730
a good thing I saved.

662
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:32,490
Mom?

663
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,050
Why did she shoot me, Mom?

664
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,550
Oh my god.

665
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:40,480
Okay, I think maybe then...

666
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,470
Can I go to...

667
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,270
You want some meat?

668
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,410
Oh, I can't go in.

669
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:50,290
Okay.

670
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,450
Can I do it?

671
00:54:52,470 --> 00:55:01,110

673
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:31,990
You just hang out here.

674
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:33,570
All the time.

675
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,890
I'm not a person, Steve.

676
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,310
I'm an object.

677
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,550
You do well to remember that.

678
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,750
A person is his job.

679
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,050
Someday you'll understand that.

680
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,850
And if you don't, it won't matter because you'll be dead.

681
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:48,790
Oh, dead.

682
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,830
Have you gotten your lodge application in yet?

683
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,250
Yeah.

684
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,950
Uh, yes.

685
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:55,670
Good.

686
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,510
You may survive yet.

687
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,930
I guess you're here to steal the bolt.

688
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,070
How do you know that?

689
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,550
Are you gonna rat on me?

690
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:05,930
Not at all.

691
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,270
That's not my job.

692
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:08,810
My opinion on Zeus' mother has changed.

693
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:16,370
Since I am an object dart, and since art should be interpreted, I'll give you a clue as to where the bolt is located.

694
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:22,010
Darkness gives as darkness gets, but light invoked is light shed.

695
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,070
Uh, darkness...

696
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:28,410
What was it?

697
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:28,870
Darkness?

698
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,190
Still here, eh?

699
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,110
Where else would I go, Steve?

700
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:33,010
Yes.

701
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:33,770
Good.

702
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:34,150
Okay.

703
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:34,810
Oh, sorry.

704
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:37,850
The mural?

705
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,470
Darkness.

706
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,130
What did he say?

707
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,250
Darkness something?

708
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,690
This game is very strange.

709
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,090
Yeah, it is.

710
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,130
Darkness...

711
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:51,170
This dude is a better method actor than Jared Leto.

712
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:53,210
Is that the Joker man?

713
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,390
Check the fireplace.

714
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,920
Something about light.

715
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,120
It's too high to reach.

716
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,580
Oh, do I use, like, the ladder?

717
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,940
All right.

718
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,260
You climb up and...

719
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,780
Receive a piece of cloth in the wall light.

720
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,720
Oh, I got it.

721
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,040
Okay.

722
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,500
Let's go.

723
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,600
Oh, yeah.

724
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,860
There was just the Morbius and there was a Tron that just came out with him, too.

725
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,260
Crazy.

726
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:27,700
Okay.

727
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,000
All right, cool.

728
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,540
it having acquired the cloth you can make your way back to the house after an exhausting day

729
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,400
yeah we did day three

730
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:58,310
sensor oh because of his oh uh ah

731
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,090
wait i'm making it look more etsy than it really is

732
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:23,250
show me the burger of my future I made it look more sexy than it really was.

733
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,370
Oh, yeah, cheeseburger.

734
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:44,470
Be honest, I'm not judging or anything.

735
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,210
Were you so hairy as an 18-year-old?

736
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,330
Wargum.

737
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,220
So, yes, yes.

738
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,280
So it's not so bizarre, then.

739
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,800
Absolutely not.

740
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:04,760
Kind of, yeah.

741
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,700
He's just his...

742
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,020
I think it's really his outfit that makes him...

743
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,560
That ages him, too, you know?

744
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,220
Like, what 18-year-old is wearing this?

745
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:18,630
Um...

746
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,530
Since we...

747
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,710
Since we didn't talk to her yesterday, I missed crucial information.

748
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:23,110
Oh.

749
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,210
You know those firemen?

750
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,010
The funny ones with the color sense.

751
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,390
Looks like they misplaced a bolt of expensive...

752
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:28,830
fabric.

753
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,250
Of course, each one of them suspects the other.

754
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,010
Looks like a cat fight is brewing.

755
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,090
Well, not a cat fight.

756
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,950
The girls are fighting!

757
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:37,190
Bye.

758
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:38,810
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

759
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,130
Jimmy's not coming back, mom.

760
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,670
Steve really dresses like my grandfather did.

761
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,430
I know!

762
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,930
It's truly the outfit.

763
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,410
Oh, I don't want to tell you.

764
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,750
This is the good part.

765
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,010
You're in trouble.

766
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,390
How's it feel?

767
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,450
be a jailbird.

768
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,190
How's it feel being a little punk, punk?

769
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,590
At least I'm not a jailbird.

770
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,330
You know what happens to jailbirds?

771
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,670
Just like turkeys and chickens, they wind up getting cooked.

772
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,570
There's like not a thought behind this, kids.

773
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,030
Fry.

774
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,110
Oh, it's too bad they don't give scalp badges for digging up buried kids.

775
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,810
I like to see what that badge would look like.

776
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,950
I went over to ask her what it was like being buried alive and all.

777
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:33,590
But she just stared at me and twitched and drew her.

778
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,790
Yes, I got my answer.

779
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:36,530
Huh.

780
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:38,290
What?

781
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,790
I can make that happen for you, Hank.

782
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,310
Good.

783
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:42,390
Finally.

784
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:43,910
You want to be buried alive?

785
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,630
I'm crazy now.

786
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,490
I'm crazy now.

787
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,450
All right, let's see.

788
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,150
I feel like we can still save over the meaty papers.

789
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,330
I haven't really done that much.

790
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:36,930

791
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:44,130
He loves that thing though I kind of hate Hank I'm sure I'm not alone there.

792
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:59,370
Hank is terrible oh no but he's a barber he loves his barber pole thinking of opening a salon, Sarge lack of respect for authority

797
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:43,610
Hello.

798
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,110
Hello, Steve.

799
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:46,550
Hi.

800
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,710
Care to buy anything today?

801
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,450
Yes, please.

802
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,410
Just point to whatever you want.

803
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,270
I'm a little hard of hearing.

804
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:53,870
Okay.

805
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:55,050
Oh, oops.

806
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:55,410
Sorry.

807
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:02,070
Naughty fellas like Deputy Loomis aside, I think every man should cultivate an interest in girly magazines.

808
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:38,980
If it'll keep them out of the field of interior design, those fireman Betsy Betsy who's that no I'm Steve okay let's see um can I get a coffee no can I get some poison no right there's the tape black electrical tape you must pay how do I buy it though slightly used wrench you must pay mrs.

my bad.

810
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,100
I think I have to actually give her the money first.

811
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,070
I should cover it.

812
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,330
These 1950s prices are cheap.

813
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,390
Take what you need.

814
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:53,270
Oh, nice.

815
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,030
Okay, cool.

816
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:57,510
Pick it up.

817
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,230
That's mine.

818
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:00,150
Pick it up.

819
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,850
That's mine.

820
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:03,370
Oh, no!

821
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,150
Not even coffee.

822
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,020
Alright, well, we got the tape and the wrench.

823
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:31,500
And, uh, we hobble to the, um, let's see, this is the barbershop, right?

824
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:32,580
Yeah.

825
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:35,660
Pastorelli.

826
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,400
That's right, everybody in here is so funny.

827
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:40,560
Hello.

828
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:41,820
Hello.

829
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,100
Hello?

830
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,260
Oh, doesn't respond.

831
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,360
Not understanding English.

832
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:45,960
Oh, sorry.

833
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,400
Hello.

834
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:47,600
Hello.

835
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,400
Uh, hello?

836
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,140
Oh, gosh, I don't know why my game is...

837
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,740
I keep clicking, but it's not happening.

838
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:03,400
The worst and the fire station full of sissies is a fire station full of pigs, sissies.

839
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,040
I like how this is like the drama of the town right now.

840
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,940
How the firefighters are angry at each other.

841
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:19,720
Boy, whoever said fight and fire with fire be happy and harvest because we got a fire station full of flamers.

842
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:22,860
Okay.

843
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:23,840
Bye.

844
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,000
Hello?

845
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,840
Nice to see you again, Steve.

846
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,380
Why is my...

847
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:31,840
Why is it not clicking?

848
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,280
What the heck?

849
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,160
Is it my mouse or is it the game?

850
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:38,980
I can't tell.

851
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,540
But when I click like that...

852
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,080
Okay, I'm just not going to talk to them.

853
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,000
What the heck?

854
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:47,740
Hmm...

855
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,660
Might be the game.

856
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,000
Um, when...

857
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,160
What else do I do?

858
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,080
Leave?

859
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,580
Uh...

860
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,950
What else do I do?

861
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:11,230
Oh.

862
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:13,630
Uh...

863
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:14,830
Wait, we could go see...

864
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:16,130
Ah!

865
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:16,570
Sorry.

866
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:17,710
How mad they are.

867
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,430
No, we cannot go see how mad they are.

868
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,890
Just kidding.

869
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:20,390
Okay.

870
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,220
Let's go see Stephanie.

871
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:36,100
Okay.

872
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:57,900
Stephanie Hi My wife Steve It's so good to see you again I get so lonely in here Oh no I'm sorry Wanna hear what's happening out in the real world?

873
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:08,280
I'd rather forget about Harvest for a while So true Oh What's in here Huh?

874
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,100
What's happening?

875
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,020
Stephanie?

876
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,760
I feel so close to you, Steve.

877
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,100
Like we're the only two people in Harvest.

878
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,900
The only two real people.

879
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,500
Do you know what I mean?

880
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,680
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

881
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,800
You've been shut up here too long.

882
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:28,920
No, no, I get it.

883
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,720
I need to feel something again.

884
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,600
This sense I have that I've known you.

885
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,460
It's my only link to my past.

886
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:38,880
Yeah.

887
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,840
Yeah.

888
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,960
It's different than memory.

889
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,720
Maybe we don't remember each other so much as we recall the feelings deep inside.

890
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,000
Strong feelings.

891
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,200
Maybe the body has its own memory.

892
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,500
Let's find out.

893
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,660
Oh, I want you to make love to me.

894
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:05,100
Say, say, say, say, say, say the sake.

895
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,300
I want you to.

896
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,040
Then take me now.

897
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,640
Yeah, I'll make it smaller for you guys.

898
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,080
Oh my god, she's...

899
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:20,340
Why?

900
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,580
She's having like a guard...

901
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,700
Guard her on.

902
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,560
What is that?

903
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:27,560
Ah!

904
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,440
Someone's watching!

905
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:30,900
Ah!

906
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:34,600
Ah!

907
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:35,920
Ah!

908
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,400
Ah!

909
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:45,560
Ah!

910
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:45,820
Ah!

911
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,420
Ah!

912
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:47,440
Ah!

913
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:47,460
Ah!

914
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,440
Oh my god!

915
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:59,430
What is she doing?

916
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,310
What is she doing?

917
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:01,810
What's going on?

918
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,790
Oh, we got kicked out.

919
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,150
Wait, why am I just standing there?

920
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,170
What just happened?

921
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,350
I don't think I needed the sensor, but...

922
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,190
I wasn't sure if they would show Nip.

923
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,550
Oh my...

924
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:53,050
Oh, quality time with...

925
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:56,130
A quality time with Stephanie.

926
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:58,770
Quality time with Snake.

927
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:02,620
Oh!

928
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:03,800
Oh!

929
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,760
Oh my god!

930
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,100
Oh, I need to...

931
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,180
I need to leave.

932
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,360
Post-nut clarity hit him hard.

933
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:23,130
Okay, uh...

934
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,710
When does it become night time though?

935
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:32,870
Maybe I have to go to the lodge again to trigger it.

936
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:36,550
Exquisite car.

937
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:38,010
It's...

938
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:39,890
We did this though.

939
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:41,890
Freaky.

940
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,050
Freaky.

941
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,160
Eh?

942
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,740
Because I'm looking at the walkthrough.

943
01:10:59,020 --> 01:10:59,940
And...

944
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,880
It's not telling me anything else, so I'm kind of confused.

945
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:14,670
It says to get the stuff at the general store and then go to the lodge, which I went to the lodge first, but whatever.

946
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:17,910
I guess...

947
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,190
And then it says it'll become night time.

948
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:21,250
Oh, when it's night.

949
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,890
So I guess let's go talk to people.

950
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:28,170
Anybody in here?

951
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:29,350
Hello?

952
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:31,070
Hello, Sheriff.

953
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:32,870
Dwayne Dwayne?

954
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:37,230
The way you keep pestering me, you'd think you were feeling guilty about something.

955
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:37,870
Are you?

956
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:39,730
What does that mean?

957
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:43,310
I got a report here that someone put a ding on Johnson's Tucker.

958
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:50,190
As honory as Johnson is about that old car, I suppose he had it coming.

959
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:53,970
I imagine it was just some kids pulling a prank.

960
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,050
Just a prank.

961
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,050
I know we're near solving the Tucker case.

962
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:28,730
And now I have to deal with a bunch of firemen throwing a hissy fit over some stolen cloth can you imagine what the heck is going on around here so true okay bye stop on by anytime steve i don't want to talk to this guy what's his name lumis i'm sorry i don't feel up right now with the talking that is okay thank goodness i don't want to talk to you either anytime kiddo bye

963
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,170
Let's go.

964
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:37,990
Edna's diner seems pretty safe.

965
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:42,230
Nice motorcycle.

966
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,410
Are you okay, Karen?

967
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,750
Bye-bye.

968
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:48,230
Okay.

969
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:49,730
I can't talk now.

970
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:53,110
The dishes are stacked up and back, and I better take advantage of the lull.

971
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:54,110
The lull.

972
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:56,990
I just heard that Mr. Johnson's Tucker was vandalized.

973
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:57,970
Everyone's talking about...

974
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:58,990
Oh, we should go talk to him.

975
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:03,570
Though I don't like to think ill of people and the misfortunes of others.

976
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:08,790
I'd like to think it's a comeuppance for all the times that nasty man has bothered me.

977
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:09,730
So true.

978
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:12,570
I feel terrible about what happened at the fire station.

979
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:15,330
Those firemen helped me decorate my diner.

980
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:15,910
Aww.

981
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:19,050
I can't believe one of them stole that cloth from the others.

982
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,930
It must have been someone else's in the fireplace.

983
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,090
Oh no, sorry, it wasn't in the fireplace.

984
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:24,830
It was in the light.

985
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,070
I'm so stupid.

986
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:26,690
Sorry.

987
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:29,130
It's because I examined the fireplace.

988
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:32,490
Sorry.

989
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:33,730
Sorry.

990
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:36,550
Sorry.

991
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,750
Oh my gosh, there's a scratch on it.

992
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,090
Sorry, my head is blocking it.

993
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,290
Look, there's a scratch on it.

994
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:46,650
Ugh, guys.

995
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:48,790
I think I'm stupid.

996
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:52,510
Um.

997
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:57,850
Stephanie hours.

998
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:03,710
Wait, no.

999
01:14:04,870 --> 01:15:07,750

Bye now.

1002
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,060
The whiplash!

1003
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,650
What is happening?

1004
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,400
Charlie!

1005
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,460
There were so many things happening at once!

1009
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:57,800
Um...

1010
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,490
I'm not quite sure what option to pick here.

1011
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:06,130
When's the last time I say...

1012
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,050
Oh, it was about Stephanie.

1013
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:07,950
Okay.

1014
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:09,670
Um...

1015
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:10,310
Hmm.

1016
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,170
I think we should...

1017
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:13,930
Uh...

1018
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:14,650
Hmm.

1019
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,030
I think we should accuse him.

1020
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:20,090
Yeah, I know what that...

1021
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:22,930
crazy little bitch said, but it's not She's like seven!

1022
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:24,890
I was at home that night.

1023
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,430
Mrs. Pottsdam will vouch for me.

1024
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,810
Isn't that right, Mrs. Pottsdam?

1025
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,130
That's right, Mr. Pottsdam.

1026
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,190
Hello, Steve.

1027
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,170
Care to stay for some pot roast?

1028
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,130
Forget the pot roast, mother.

1029
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,990
Pot roast isn't for backstabbers.

1030
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:43,590
For persecutors.

1031
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,250
I won't share my meat with him.

1032
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:47,670
My meat!

1033
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:48,950
My meat!

1034
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,770
You always were a kid or minto.

1035
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,450
Bye now.

1036
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,610
Thank you for the same with that.

1037
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,090
Why are you covering for him, Mrs. Pottsdam?

1038
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,450
Wait, oh, there we go.

1039
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:05,810
It's the truth.

1040
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:06,850
That's why.

1041
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:13,050
And I think you better be going, young man, before I call your mother and tell on you.

1042
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:14,270
Oh.

1043
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:17,950
Someone went and scraped up Johnson's car?

1044
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:19,290
My meat!

1045
01:18:20,170 --> 01:19:08,730
he'd step in a bear trap and chew his own leg off rather than suffer he looks so much like jack black no he looks like rich from red letter media those silly willies down at the fire station are just incensed about losing some decorating stuff some people yeah yeah maybe they should be more concerned with fire and less with the flame okay bye i like how we're getting everybody's little commentary about the incidents but because I didn't talk to them about the what's it called talk to them about the scratch I'm talking to them all now at once so I'm getting everything all their opinions at once I fear how people will use that line in the future my meat he might want to be extra nice to mr.

1046
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:15,290

1048
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:53,760
If it isn't my favorite son-in-law, what brings you here again?

1049
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,120
Peepo.

1050
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:56,600
Peepole.

1051
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,300
Peepole.

1052
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:00,780
Beg pardon?

1053
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,400
You've got a peephole in the upstairs bathroom.

1054
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,580
It looks in on Stephanie's room.

1055
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,380
Well, I'll be darned.

1056
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,800
The second option!

1057
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:27,390
Mrs. Potsdam's never been to Lebanon.

1058
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:58,410
in her life someone's peeping in on Stephanie if it's not Mrs. Potsdam then who is it it's literally that vine no I'm American thanks for calling this to my attention Steve then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it now there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business I guess not so long as you patch that hole well I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else I thought you where it was.

1059
01:20:59,290 --> 01:20:59,450
Ooh!

1060
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:02,830
Who else would it be?

1061
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,130
Can I go tell her?

1062
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,510
Oh, Stephanie, Stephanie!

1063
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:09,250
Stephanie, Stephanie!

1064
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:12,070
I'm glad to see you.

1065
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,090
I feel so alone, cooped up in here.

1066
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:19,850
My faux mother keeps me up on the latest gossip.

1067
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:20,350
Oh.

1068
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,590
Not like she really wants to talk to me.

1069
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:27,390
More like she's feeding me in for me.

1070
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:28,490
Right.

1071
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:33,170
For instance, she told me that Mr. Johnson's Tucker was vandalized.

1072
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:33,890
Yeah, I did that.

1073
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,250
That's another weird thing.

1074
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:39,290
Every car I've seen drive by is a Tucker.

1075
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:41,750
There were only 31 produced.

1076
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:42,790
What are the odds of that?

1077
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,710
I've always wanted a Tucker.

1078
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,630
Funny that Harvest would be full of them.

1079
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,510
Any idea who scratched the car?

1080
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:51,290
I did.

1081
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:52,070
Me.

1082
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:54,570
Why would you do something like that?

1083
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,870
It's part of the lodge initiation.

1084
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:05,170
I see look I don't know what's going on here, but getting into the lodge is the best way to find out By committing vandalism.

1085
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:06,470
It was a prank.

1086
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:06,790
Oh

1087
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:12,050
It's a harmless enough prank.

1088
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:12,890
It's just a prank.

1089
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,270
It's just a prank.

1090
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:18,770
It was a crime, Steve Don't be so melodramatic about it.

1091
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:19,190
Uh-oh.

1092
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:21,930
I've heard of worse fraternity initiations.

1093
01:22:23,090 --> 01:23:18,150
Sorry when you put it that way I guess I was overreacting you know the fireman someone stole some fabric from them and they're up in arms about it yeah it was me I took that another harmless prank and how many more harmless pranks will you be pulling however many it takes to get in Stephanie if I have to use them to escape than I will are you using them or are they using you it was just a bolt of cloth you've turned the firemen against each other they think one of their own stole it would you rather stay here I've heard that harvest is lovely in the fall when the leaves turn orange and gold and the annual blood drive paints the town red all right all right you have a point is it true you found Karen yeah Yeah,

1094
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:19,890
just in time, too.

1095
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,170
He'd molested her and buried her alive.

1096
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:28,530
He couldn't bring himself to kill her outright, so he just decided to stick her in the ground and let fate take its course.

1097
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,890
Who would do that to a helpless child?

1098
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:37,110
She says it was Mr. Potsdam, and I believe her.

1099
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:38,270
Oh, Christ.

1100
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:44,710
And all this time, I've been under the same roof with that thing watching me.

1101
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:46,450
Take it easy, okay?

1102
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,330
Take it easy.

1103
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:50,910
At least he'll be coming to take him away, won't they?

1104
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:56,390
Oh, so if I tell you peephole, peephole.

1105
01:23:57,610 --> 01:24:05,170
Stephanie, I think you should know there's a peephole hidden behind the picture in the bathroom.

1106
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:07,810
You mean a peephole?

1107
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:09,370
How does she not?

1108
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:11,810
But shouldn't she see the hole in the wall?

1109
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,250
So that's the scraping I hear every night.

1110
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:16,630
The picture sliding along the wall.

1111
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:17,490
Oh my god.

1112
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:17,690
What?

1113
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:19,890
Disgusting.

1114
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:22,410
I've got to get out of here, Steve.

1115
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:27,250
I thought of that fat slob watching me.

1116
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,370
I confronted Potsdam about it.

1117
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:32,430
He tried to play dumb, but I got him to say he'd fix it.

1118
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:33,490
Thank you, Steve.

1119
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:36,090
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1120
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:37,250
Oh my gosh, we did good.

1121
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:37,890
We did good!

1122
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,790
Yes, let's go.

1123
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:41,090
Come back and visit me soon.

1124
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,070
Okay?

1125
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:42,930
Bye, Stephanie.

1126
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,990
I hope we can woo-hoo again later.

1127
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:48,230
Nice!

1128
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,830
We did good.

1129
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,520
Woo-hoo!

1130
01:24:59,120 --> 01:24:59,920
Okay, cool.

1131
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,080
Is it night time yet?

1132
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,540
Guys, how do I make a night?

1133
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:08,680
Um...

1134
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,340
Let's go talk to people at the post office.

1135
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,640
Maybe talk to the general.

1136
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,980
Hello, Postmaster Boyle.

1137
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:16,480
Sorry, son.

1138
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,400
No time to talk.

1139
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,680
Neither rain nor sleep nor snow nor hair.

1140
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,060
hell shall keep the mail from its appointed rounds.

1141
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:25,980
Woo-hoo.

1142
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,140
Next time you post, don't forget the zip code.

1143
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,880
Don't forget the zip code.

1144
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,180
Zip code map with harvest dead center.

1145
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:38,800
Can I leave?

1146
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,680
How do I get out of here?

1147
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,040
Get me out of here.

1148
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:41,900
There we go.

1149
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,220
Do I have two screwdrivers?

1150
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,580
I have a wrench.

1151
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:57,280
I'm taping.

1152
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,160
I have one screwdriver.

1153
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,140
Do I need two?

1154
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,240
A screwdriver at the...

1155
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:13,800
Diner.

1156
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:14,540
Okay.

1157
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:15,300
Maybe?

1158
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,380
One more.

1159
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,160
Okay, I didn't know that.

1160
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:18,460
Oops.

1161
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:19,780
Ah, yeah, but...

1162
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:20,000
Okay.

1163
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,380
At the diner.

1164
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,000
There's one in here?

1165
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,620
Where would it be?

1166
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,040
It's hard to find.

1167
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,280
Is that it?

1168
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:38,500
No.

1169
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,140
Middle left.

1170
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,130
Examine the drawer.

1171
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:56,390
Oh, sorry.

1172
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:57,550
I accidentally clicked too fast.

1173
01:26:58,230 --> 01:26:59,110
Oh my gosh.

1174
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:00,990
How are you supposed to see that?

1175
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:04,090
This town is a bit screwy.

1176
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:04,870
I'll take that.

1177
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:07,710
How are you supposed to see that?

1178
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:12,250
Holy moly.

1179
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,850
Oh my gosh.

1180
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:18,270
Okay, well, thank you so much.

1181
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:19,730
Ah, here we go!

1182
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:23,910
The way everyone says Steve feels like they're on family view.

1183
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:25,950
Yay!

1184
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:27,690
Oh my gosh, you saved me!

1185
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:29,490
Thank you, thank you!

1186
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,160
Gosh, how are you supposed to do that?

1187
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,220
Alright, to the...

1188
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:45,940
But we got to talk to a lot of people, so that's always kind of fun.

1189
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,540
the barbershop is closed

1190
01:27:54,840 --> 01:28:03,240
I have a closet key broom closet key use it with my axe

1191
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:28,200
um yeah we're breaking in but how so I think I need to use the electrical tape on something because I Oh, oh, what?

1192
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,580
Well, I was going to say just because I bought it.

1193
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,580
But okay.

1194
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:37,460
The wrench?

1195
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,160
Ow!

1196
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,600
Weeks of fun, more like years.

1197
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,440
Okay, we've made it.

1198
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,630
The sheep.

1199
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:53,470
Except for the occasional hairball cough, it's hard to tell if the sheep is alive or not.

1200
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:56,770
Wait, but the barber pole...

1201
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:00,810
What is this picture?

1202
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:02,630
Picture of young Mr. Pastorelli.

1203
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,350
Spaghetti in his mouth and all.

1204
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:06,430
I want spaghetti.

1205
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:08,110
Sounds good.

1206
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:09,690
Fancy barber pole secured to the wall.

1207
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:10,130
Oh.

1208
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:11,590
The screws.

1209
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:13,590
We'll use it.

1210
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:13,810
Oh.

1211
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:14,950
Oh, that's why.

1212
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,270
Because it said it was a...

1213
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:18,430
This is the straight slot screwdriver.

1214
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:19,990
And this is a Phillips...

1215
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:20,810
Oh.

1216
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:22,450
Ah!

1217
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:32,430
Did I get arrested?

1218
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,400
Oopsie.

1219
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,320
Wait, why?

1220
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,300
This is your second arrest.

1221
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:49,660
Ah!

1222
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,460
You just remember, one more strike, and you're out.

1223
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,360
Oopsie.

1224
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:56,980
Oh.

1225
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,320
Wait, I'm actually in the...

1226
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,060
Iron stains streak the inside of the jail sink.

1227
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,420
Deputy Loomis' favorite hot spot.

1228
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:07,020
Ew!

1229
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,300
The next inmate will get to use this rickety cot as a bed.

1230
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,240
Tint cup looks like a prop.

1231
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:15,860
right out of an Alcatraz movie.

1232
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:19,940
The toilet's connecting copper pipe is loose.

1233
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,260
Oh, can I take it?

1234
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,480
Oh, okay.

1235
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:27,620
Thanks.

1236
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,060
Wait, now you can't use the toilet, though.

1237
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,100
The jail gate is locked.

1238
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:38,650
Free pipe?

1239
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:42,830
Well, that didn't work.

1240
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:44,830
Well, that didn't work.

1241
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:45,530
Ah!

1242
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:46,150
Sorry.

1243
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:47,630
Oh my gosh.

1244
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:49,610
Jailbreak?

1245
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:52,330
Dismantled sink?

1246
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:53,770
I'll take that.

1247
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:55,770
Okay.

1248
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,110
Well, that didn't work.

1249
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:03,990
Damn it.

1250
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:05,670
Well, that didn't work.

1251
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:09,010
Well, that didn't work.

1252
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:10,190
What?

1253
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:11,750
Oh, I could just leave.

1254
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:13,590
Oh, no, I can't.

1255
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:16,350
I think I should reload anyway.

1256
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:17,430
Honestly.

1257
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:21,550
What did I do wrong?

1258
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:26,900
Oh, dang.

1259
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,300
We have to go back to the diner.

1260
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:43,420
Oh, I think I'm gonna sneeze.

1261
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:45,420
Ah.

1262
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,200
Eh.

1263
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,060
Oh, my gosh.

1264
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:50,360
Okay.

1265
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,140
Okay.

1266
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:53,620
Sorry.

1267
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:54,720
I'm fine.

1268
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,760
I took some...

1269
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,180
What's it called earlier?

1270
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:02,260
Some...

1271
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:02,700
medicine.

1272
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:05,000
Because my nose was... Ugh.

1273
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:05,520
Ugh.

1274
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:07,040
Made my head all cloggy.

1275
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:13,100
I don't know why I can't sneeze on stream, you guys.

1276
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:16,620
Once I start talking about a sneeze, I can't sneeze.

1277
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,200
I just can't do it.

1278
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:25,030
I don't know why.

1279
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:29,580
Okay.

1280
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,040
Alright, let's try again.

1281
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:36,460
I don't know why stealing the barber pole set off the alarm, but not um...

1282
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:45,640
But not breaking the door down, sure, whatever.

1283
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,100
What else can we use to bust down the door?

1284
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:51,360
Pitchfork.

1285
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,200
Oh my gosh, it worked!

1286
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,700
The phantom sneeze.

1287
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:16,520
Jim Bob, who was the high school star pitcher 20 years ago, hangs his aging letter jacket here.

1288
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,180
When he comes here for a trim.

1289
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,640
Oh, operate the light switch.

1290
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:22,480
Wait, why?

1291
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,320
Oh, it turned it off.

1292
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,280
Okay.

1293
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,040
Maybe that will do it.

1294
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:32,320
Yeah.

1295
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,220
Yeah.

1296
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,660
Yeah.

1297
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:38,460
Okay.

1298
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,980
We made it.

1299
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,240
Having acquired your barber pole, you make your way to the house.

1300
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:55,580
Okay, cool.

1301
01:33:58,890 --> 01:33:59,830
Now my nose is all runny.

1302
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:04,710
I-I-I did the, what's it called, the nose spray.

1303
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:07,830
Because I wanted my nose to not be running.

1304
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:09,670
Ah!

1305
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:10,410
Ah!

1306
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:11,170
Ah!

1307
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:36,370
What do you people want from me?

1308
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,870
Cheeseburger.

1309
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:47,250
Oh my god, his eyes are popping out!

1310
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:53,330
I saved you.

1311
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:06,590
No woohoo tonight.

1312
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:08,250
We got the woohoo though earlier.

1313
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:09,930
It's crazy.

1314
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:15,790
Press Ctrl F4 and click the left mouse button.

1315
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:18,910
Oh.

1316
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:29,780
Oh, I did it.

1317
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,270
Disc 2!

1318
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:35,930
Woohoo!

1319
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:38,190
Disc 2- Disc swap!

1320
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:40,250
Let's go.

1321
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:42,450
All right, let's save though.

1322
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:43,310
Save.

1323
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,560
Control.

1324
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,220
F4.

1325
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,480
And left click.

1326
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:00,280
Okay.

1327
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,700
This is a hefty game, huh?

1328
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,140
Ma'am!

1329
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:07,940
Good morning, mother!

1330
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:09,280
Hello, dear.

1331
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,300
How are you today?

1332
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,060
Did you hear what happened at the bar?

1333
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:12,660
barber shop?

1334
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,680
Someone broke into Pastorelli's salon and took his antique barber's pole.

1335
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:23,180
The next morning, Pastorelli touched some live wires that the thief left lying around and was electrocuted.

1336
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:26,920
Well, that darn foreigner got what he deserved if you ask me.

1337
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:27,520
What?

1338
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:30,700
Come into a nice little town like harvest and stealing business.

1339
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,220
There's no other barber's here!

1340
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:39,460
If a bowl of scissors were good enough for your father, I don't see why decent working folk need a fancy wap styling their hair.

1341
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:40,840
That's how it goes.

1342
01:36:40,980 --> 01:37:13,440
First you get a sissy then bang you're a communist isn't it exciting steve five days and 1200 cookies later the bake sale is already here where does the time fly where does the time fly one thousand two hundred cookies how many are you taking to the sale but how many oh the rest is tail but the effort wasn't wasted it's for a good cause what is happening oh um wouldn't miss it that's nice dear be open to new experiences.

1343
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,580
Thanks for protecting our innocence.

1344
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:15,340
Of course.

1345
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,460
Wait, good cause.

1346
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,500
Yeah, I got you with the sensors.

1347
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,440
Having a fake sale to pay for burying out-of-towners?

1348
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,420
Goshahoodies, what should we do?

1349
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,060
Leave them in the streets?

1350
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,420
Of course we should bury them.

1351
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:31,480
But why do so many out-of-towners drop dead in harvest?

1352
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:32,080
Yeah.

1353
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:37,040
I have wondered about that, and I think it has something to do with the air.

1354
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,140
But there's nothing wrong with the air.

1355
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:40,340
It's perfectly clean.

1356
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,760
That's what I mean.

1357
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:46,220
Big city folk, they get so used to smog that clean air is a shock to their systems.

1358
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,120
Gets them every time.

1359
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,400
Okay, bye, mom.

1360
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,420
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

1361
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,000
No, no, Jimmy James, please.

1362
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,580
It's true.

1363
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,220
It's really shocking their system.

1364
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,580
Oh my goodness gracious.

1365
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,660
I don't want to talk to Hank.

1366
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,560
I don't like him.

1367
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,400
She won't let me forget Jimmy.

1368
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,440
They were like, you killed him.

1369
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,280
This is my purgatory.

1370
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,080
This is so...

1371
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,220
Oh my gosh.

1372
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,680
Okay, we gotta go to the lodge.

1373
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,940
And give them the pole.

1374
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,560
I hope nobody looks in my pockets.

1375
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,460
And here it is.

1376
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,120
The object dog.

1377
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,560
Imported by shinglass.

1378
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,540
And Italian dreams.

1379
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,760
Italian dreams.

1380
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:40,220
Oh, mama bea.

1381
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,940
Oh my gosh.

1382
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:57,120
that pastorelli was electrocuted because you left live wires wait he's alive though right but it's those with affectations of worldliness say say love you wait is he alive did i kill him

1383
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,440
pastorelli took a big spill a permanent

1384
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:09,440
he's dead

1385
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:20,180
voodoo yes a barber cut down in his prime Of course.

1386
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,080
You only wanted the pole.

1387
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,260
But that hardly matters now.

1388
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:36,580
Your final assignment is to set Avaya in D-N-A's diner and let the French fry where they may.

1389
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:37,660
What does that mean?

1390
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:39,880
Wait, is this still a prank?

1391
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,880
Guys, this is it.

1392
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,200
That's the gateway prank.

1393
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:48,540
The gateway prank is...

1394
01:39:49,540 --> 01:40:20,140
somebody's car and then then before you know it you're accidentally electrocuting people and then you're setting fires i is is is edna french yes i suggest you succeed beyond that you must find your own answers members of the order must be resourceful and cunning it's like how you Jimmy James.

1395
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,590
This whole town is a prank.

1396
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,520
Tonight, the bake sale commences.

1397
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:30,560
Soon, the annual harvest blood dry...

1398
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,420
We graduate from pranks to a little bit of trolling.

1399
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:43,180
When sacrifice will be the order of the day, your time in harvest grows short.

1400
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:46,620
Does everyone just die during the blood dry?

1401
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,560
What is happening?

1402
01:40:49,540 --> 01:41:07,760
look like a cross between edward norton and voice critical i don't who uh i don't know edward norton tonight to the bake sale commences okay um i is at the school uh

1403
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,920

1404
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:56,990

1405
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:59,810
That's no excuse for hurting someone else.

1406
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:03,510
Even if Pastorelli were alive now, his heart would be broken.

1407
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:06,370
And what's a little profit compared to that?

1408
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:07,430
Whoopsie!

1409
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:08,330
My bad.

1410
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:09,830
This is my birthday!

1411
01:42:10,230 --> 01:42:10,750
It's Avina!

1412
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:12,070
Happy birthday!

1413
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:19,490
Does Amir, does he sound like Urukai General from Return of the King?

1414
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:20,130
Yeah.

1415
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:24,430
exit sign.

1416
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:27,250
But I have to do the exit other exit sign.

1417
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:29,130
Um, okay.

1418
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:30,910
Well, 6 to 10.

1419
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,870
We haven't gone here in a bit.

1420
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:36,230
The guy in the top hat.

1421
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:41,890
Yeah, she keeps expressing morals.

1422
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:45,210
Why am I...

1423
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:48,290
I've been only talking to the people that are like...

1424
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:49,370
Oh gosh, the sounds.

1425
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:55,130
I've been only talking to the people or rather pulling pranks on the people that are...

1426
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:58,270
Are, like, decent.

1427
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:01,690
A young man lies motionless in the casket.

1428
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:03,590
Red stains are visible on his shirts and boots.

1429
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:05,610
Wait, what?

1430
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:07,850
Who are you?

1431
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:10,690
I thought it was gonna be Mr. Pastorelli.

1432
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:14,210
Why are we...

1433
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:15,570
Why are we stripping him?

1434
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:18,970
Oh my god.

1435
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,010
My Yeti hand.

1436
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:25,270
Oh, sorry.

1437
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:26,210
I did the same thing.

1438
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:27,070
My bad.

1439
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,920
Yeah, why is our first instinct to do that?

1440
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:37,860
Tommy!

1441
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:46,270
Did we take a picture of it?

1442
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:51,670
Oh, you take a photo of the body.

1443
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:53,210
Okay.

1444
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,890
I don't think that's the pastor, right?

1445
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:02,230
That's what I thought.

1446
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:03,890
Or not the...

1447
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,150
Uh, uh, the...

1448
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:05,990
Not the pastor.

1449
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,890
Sorry, I read your comment.

1450
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:08,170
That pastor, Mr. Relly.

1451
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:09,970
No, I think the barber.

1452
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:11,590
What was his name?

1453
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:12,450
Pastor Relly.

1454
01:44:15,670 --> 01:44:17,090
Um, okay, I'm gonna look at the cut.

1455
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,470
Uh, the...

1456
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:19,750
The guide.

1457
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:20,510
Walk through.

1458
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:25,710
Um...

1459
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:26,090
Okay.

1460
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:30,390
Use your camera, take a photo, bring it to Mr. Moynihan.

1461
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,350
That's, uh, this guy, isn't it?

1462
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:35,430
Mr. Moynihan?

1463
01:44:35,630 --> 01:44:35,910
Um...

1464
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:36,550
Is that this guy?

1465
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:40,390
And the pastor, Barbarelli.

1466
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:41,450
Yeah.

1467
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:43,190
Oh, wait.

1468
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:45,370
We haven't talked to him at all in a bit, so let's talk to him.

1469
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:48,730
Young man, we really have nothing to say to each other.

1470
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:53,150
I have the feeling your image shall soon adorn my slab.

1471
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:57,190
And I'd rather not know the face of the meat I'm slicing.

1472
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:58,290
Why do you think that?

1473
01:44:58,570 --> 01:45:03,970
It seems that like some elephant's graveyard, people of low station come to harvest and die.

1474
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:08,930
drop dead, penniless, and they all need burials.

1475
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:10,230
Why are they dying?

1476
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:11,630
Like that corpse in the chapel.

1477
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:12,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1478
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:14,830
All dressed up and nowhere to go.

1479
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:16,170
No mourners.

1480
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:21,310
Now point that I still must provide them with prompt burials by town charter.

1481
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:24,490
He didn't just drop dead, he has those weird scars on them.

1482
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:29,730
God knows by putting these people up at the Wayward Hotel, I do more than my fair share.

1483
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:33,810
So why must I pay for the coffins and burial materials as well?

1484
01:45:34,390 --> 01:46:36,990
My losses to the dead are hopefully the bake sale will offset some of them I do hope you'll attend the bake sale and spend heavily oh it's for the needy you know sure and all they have to do to benefit is die a ditch makes a poor resting place you'll need to learn brownies maybe if you ever want to leave harvest you make it sound like I have a choice a choice that is rapidly vanishing yeah join the lodge Steven while you happened at the blood drive the corpse the corpse reclining in the chapel right now is a prime example of the difficulties I face for unfathomable reasons this bum decided to wander into harvest and summarily drop dead just like that indeed he died of purely natural causes of that I have no doubt but why come to harvest to die yeah you say this happens often isn't that a they're like a drawn to a flame.

1485
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:45,210
I've often puzzled over the situation myself, though I can assure you, young man, that nothing untoward is happening in Harvest.

1486
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:45,810
Sure.

1487
01:46:46,430 --> 01:47:01,650
On the contrary, it's an indication of our compassion that I put up hobos in the wayward hotel, and the order of the Harvest Moon mandates their prompt burial, even when they are without family or means, and when it entails losses on my part.

1488
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:04,830
I think the lodge is trying to see if I'm a psychopath.

1489
01:47:06,110 --> 01:47:08,870
And we'll kill people coming into the town.

1490
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:11,310
Okay, so we have to give him...

1491
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:11,890
I'd say it's been a pleasure.

1492
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,830
I'd have to give him the photo.

1493
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:16,110
But I find the company of the living so wearisome.

1494
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:19,710
Am I going to eat somebody?

1495
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:22,770
Oh, wait.

1496
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:24,410
I want to see it.

1497
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:26,550
Little Tommy.

1498
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,250
That...

1499
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:30,350
Oh.

1500
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:32,110
Take this.

1501
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:34,110
My checky.

1502
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:35,910
Ah, you've taken it.

1503
01:47:35,930 --> 01:48:06,990
taken up photography I see now why on earth would you choose such a grotesque subject that John Doe you got boxed up in the chapel he didn't just drop dead yeah someone helped him take the plunge yeah you may be right I'm a mortician not a medical examiner you don't have to be to know that being ripped to shreds can be detrimental to your I think ripped to shreds is a little dramatic to be looking into young man is that a threat to Yeah,

1504
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,410
is that a threat?

1505
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:12,510
Or I just want to find out who I am and how to get out of here.

1506
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:15,010
Oh, actually, I don't know which one.

1507
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:17,810
Two shreds you set.

1508
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:19,850
Why are you guys all quoting that?

1509
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,120
Minimum, minimum, minimum.

1510
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,760
Get the tiger minds down.

1511
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,760
Let me all just let him go.

1512
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:51,260
My mom said to pick the very best one and you are it.

1513
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,240
Okay, one.

1514
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,640
That's what we all want.

1515
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,960
It's about trying to get out.

1516
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:55,800
What game are you people playing?

1517
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,700
A game we win or lose together.

1518
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:00,800
Look, are you going to tell me what I want to know?

1519
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,680
Or do I go to the sheriff with these pictures?

1520
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:06,380
That would be a grave mistake, I assure you.

1521
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,560
I've told you all I can.

1522
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,120
My losses have been substantial.

1523
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,820
The sounds are so...

1524
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:17,600
The only thing I can give you in exchange for the photographs...

1525
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:20,300
Is my tube of astro glue.

1526
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,480
Let me take it.

1527
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,420
That's all you'll get from me.

1528
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:24,700
Oh.

1529
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:28,420
Uh.

1530
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:29,800
Okay.

1531
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,940
We get some glue.

1532
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,720
A wise decision.

1533
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:39,080
When a wasp's nest is stirred up, it is seldom the wasps who grieve later.

1534
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:40,140
Can we take it to the wasps?

1535
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,600
Is that a hint?

1536
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,420
Okay, we got some glue.

1537
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,160
Oh!

1538
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:53,520
It's already not.

1539
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:55,780
Oh my gosh, we're going to the big sale!

1540
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:58,900
Okay, we're not using...

1541
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,140
That was so fast.

1542
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:04,880
Okay.

1543
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:07,640
Yeah, now we have a little...

1544
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,260
He gave us a snack.

1545
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:13,740
All right, let's go to the...

1546
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,620
It's at the school, right?

1547
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:17,420
I'm gonna save real quick.

1548
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:25,650
A little snack for the...

1549
01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:26,990
road.

1550
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:30,610
Bye.

1551
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:31,910
I can't follow.

1552
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:33,050
Thank you so much for the time.

1553
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,350
Thank you.

1554
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:35,290
Thank you.

1555
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:35,990
Thank you.

1556
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:37,850
Thank you.

1557
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:40,050
Uh, examine.

1558
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:41,750
It looks like the bake sale will be held here.

1559
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:42,930
Where?

1560
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:47,130
In, in, in here.

1561
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:47,610
Oh.

1562
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:48,510
In here.

1563
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:57,360
Okay.

1564
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:58,040
Oh.

1565
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:00,640
Oh.

1566
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:01,580
Oh.

1567
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:01,640
Oh.

1568
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:01,760
Oh.

1569
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,120
Oh.

1570
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:06,250
Gymnasium rules.

1571
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:06,550
1.

1572
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:07,590
No blood on the floor.

1573
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:07,910
2.

1574
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:10,230
Do unto others as they would do unto your mother.

1575
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:10,550
3.

1576
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:11,250
No laughing.

1577
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:11,810
4.

1578
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:13,090
No sports allowed.

1579
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:17,130
Minto with a little snack for the road.

1580
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:20,330
You can't eat me.

1581
01:51:21,870 --> 01:51:23,050
Buy some cookies?

1582
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:24,990
It's for a good cause.

1583
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:27,390
Mmm.

1584
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:29,890
You all look alike.

1585
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:30,630
Mercy.

1586
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:32,530
What a terrible thing to say.

1587
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:33,770
Isn't it late?

1588
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:36,910
Yes, terrible.

1589
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:40,870
What a good boy you are.

1590
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:41,870
Have a cookie.

1591
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:43,030
Thank you.

1592
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:45,210
To hell with your cookies.

1593
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:46,790
Why, I never.

1594
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:48,830
Isn't that right, ladies?

1595
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:51,590
Yes, never.

1596
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:57,330
Oh no, it's, they're weird, they're weird.

1597
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:00,830
Uh, can I go anywhere?

1598
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:03,770
Wait, I saw exit here.

1599
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:10,550
Ladies, someone has just burned down the TV station.

1600
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:12,190
It wasn't me.

1601
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:12,830
It wasn't me.

1602
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:14,430
On the night of our bake sale?

1603
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:18,290
All colors.

1604
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:19,270
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

1605
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:20,490
Thank you so much.

1606
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:21,510
Thank you.

1607
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:23,750
On the night of our bake sale?

1608
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:29,950
Um, let's go to the TV station, I guess.

1609
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:38,470
Wait, who's that?

1610
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:44,720
Oh my god, it's on fire!

1611
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:52,420
The TV station is closed.

1612
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,380
No, kidding.

1613
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,100
Oh, it was the postman!

1614
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:07,820
Um, well, if I go to the diner...

1615
01:53:12,150 --> 01:53:13,210
Diner's locked up.

1616
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:14,450
Hold on, I'm looking at the guide.

1617
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:15,930
Go to the...

1618
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:18,150
Oh, break in the same way you broke into the barbershop.

1619
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:20,870
Oh, okay, okay.

1620
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:25,400
Oh.

1621
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,320
Okay, hold on.

1622
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:29,280
I'm going to save real quick.

1623
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,340
Now I'm going to save a little snack on the road.

1624
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:34,980
There we go.

1625
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:40,200
And then we'll use the axe this time.

1626
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:40,900
Yeah.

1627
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:44,300
Nice pink car.

1628
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:44,940
Hey!

1629
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:47,760
Um...

1630
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,000
Oh, what is this?

1631
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,320
Examine the cake cover.

1632
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:55,080
A cake?

1633
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,100
Oh, pick it up.

1634
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:57,640
What's there?

1635
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,920
Examine the grease fryer.

1636
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:00,900
Grease fryer's off.

1637
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:02,940
Uh-oh.

1638
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,620
Uh-oh.

1639
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:05,080
Uh-oh.

1640
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:05,560
Uh-oh.

1641
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:06,260
Uh-oh.

1642
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:06,680
Uh-oh.

1643
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:09,140
Oh, no.

1644
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:10,920
Um.

1645
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:19,390
Wait, there's a smoke alarm.

1646
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:21,250
Um.

1647
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:24,370
Um.

1648
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:24,990
Maybe.

1649
01:54:25,390 --> 01:54:27,010
We use this to cover it up.

1650
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:30,350
Damn it.

1651
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:31,570
Okay, no.

1652
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:35,870
Fry's in the bag, me and Toe.

1653
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:39,550
With the tape, maybe?

1654
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:40,750
Damn it.

1655
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:41,210
No?

1656
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:43,030
Damn it.

1657
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:43,750
Damn it.

1658
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:44,450
The glue?

1659
01:54:45,970 --> 01:54:47,870
You apply the glue to the rim of the cake cover.

1660
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:48,990
Oh, my gosh, I'm a genius.

1661
01:54:52,150 --> 01:54:53,290
We covered it.

1662
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:53,670
Okay.

1663
01:54:55,390 --> 01:55:23,780

Oops.

1665
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:35,780
I'm sorry, Edna.

1666
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:37,420
How will these people...

1667
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:39,640
Oh, they'll all be forced to eat only the meat.

1668
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,580
Because the diner is closed.

1669
01:55:45,740 --> 01:55:46,240
Oh, uh, ah!

1670
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:46,780
Ah!

1671
01:55:54,800 --> 01:56:03,820
I'm about to take my praxis exam for my teacher licensure.

1672
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,300
Can I get a mid-spentum?

1673
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:06,900
Good luck, charm.

1674
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:12,470
Wait, hold on.

1675
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:14,210
Watch this...

1676
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:15,970
Watch this dream sequence.

1677
01:56:16,330 --> 01:56:19,030
And imagine the cheeseburger.

1678
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:21,670
Good luck, Evan!

1679
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:23,510
You got this!

1680
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:25,290
You got this.

1681
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:26,070
You got this.

1682
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:29,290
Good luck!

1683
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:31,970
Wee!

1684
01:56:34,210 --> 01:56:39,090
Oh my gosh.

1685
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,830
It's already, what, day seven?

1686
01:56:41,950 --> 01:56:42,750
Because we...

1687
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:44,210
Lost a day.

1688
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:48,490
was that our last task i think

1689
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:57,320
so two buildings burned down last night

1690
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:27,700
there's a scene next time you enter the diner you may want to give a warning for it can be upsetting oh okay i don't know what kind of warning to give but i will hello dear how are you today the nerve of some people burning down the tv station to detract from our Oh yeah,

1691
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,380
wait, Hank can't be watching TV now.

1692
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,580
Just to annoy the Harvest PTA.

1693
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:32,580
Coincidence?

1694
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:33,840
I don't think so.

1695
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:36,780
Just six months ago, the newspaper building went up in smoke.

1696
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:39,060
Obviously, there's a firebug on the loose.

1697
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:39,720
A firebug.

1698
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:44,680
She's obsessed with communists.

1699
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:47,960
What's communism got to do with anything?

1700
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:50,300
Just ask Colonel Monroe at the missile base.

1701
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,460
He'll tell you.

1702
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:51,900
Okay.

1703
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:55,260
Now that the big sale's over, I just don't know how I'll fill my time.

1704
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,220

The stream doesn't hurt me.

1714
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:18,300
It's when there's no stream that it hurts me.

1715
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:23,480
Oh boy, golly.

1716

The game is getting crazy.

I mean, it was already crazy.

1719
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:31,860
Let's go see what's going on at the TV station first.

1720
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:41,320

02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:28,760
Say, he's a buckaroo.

1731
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,980
He's just a buckaroo down on his luck!

She's hiding in.

1736
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:09,460
Oh, oh, bug God.

1737
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:13,680
And she's eating.

1738
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:20,580
They're right in front of you.

1739
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:26,200
In front of my salad.

1740
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:36,320
Well, um...

1741
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:40,520
Oh, golly.

1742
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:46,160
Oh, okay, let's just save so we don't have to watch that again.

1743
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:50,780
We'll save over this one.

1744
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:52,700
Yeah, the baby.

1745
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:53,950
The baby is sick.

1746
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:55,820
What happened?

1747
02:05:56,420 --> 02:06:00,440
Um, uh, we won't be seeing Edna or Karen anymore.

1748
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:02,260
They went upstate.

1749
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,040
They moved out of harvest.

1750
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:06,280
Thank goodness, right?

1751
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,560
Yeah, a sewer slide.

1752
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:12,380
Okay.

1753
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:19,880
Um, all right, I'm going to look at the guide to see what we do here.

1754
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,340
Okay, visit Stephanie.

1755
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:25,120
We'll get over it by visiting our girlfriend.

1756
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:27,940
It's all good.

1757
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,020
I guess we do have to go...

1758
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:33,000
Wait, let's all...

1759
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,240
Wait, let's go to the lodge first.

1760
02:06:37,520 --> 02:07:07,020
let's go to the lodge first since i want to know what they say dna's diner is no more as is edna herself she hung herself i don't think you should tell her about this one i don't think so chief i think we should lie to her for this one to her beloved establishment a true entrepreneur and a credit to her nation the captain went down with her ship No idea!

1761
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:08,220
Come now.

1762
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:08,960
I really did.

1763
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:17,320
Anyone who spoke with her for five minutes would have known what a tragedy the destruction of her diner would be.

1764
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:19,420
We could put the bake sale towards her.

1765
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:23,540
You sought to torture diner and torched it is.

1766
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:29,040
You have proven yourself a worthy candidate for initiation.

1767
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:36,260
What if Mr. Potsdam burying Karen was one of his initiators?

1768
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:42,060
And because he got caught, that's why they rejected him.

1769
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:44,400
Look, look, welcome to Mambushabdaku!

1770
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:47,560
I thought this was the initiation.

1771
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:48,200
Yeah.

1772
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:54,360
This was only a trial to determine your worthiness for testing.

1773
02:07:54,860 --> 02:07:59,920
Your initiation into the mysteries of the harvest will soon begin.

1774
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:03,600
In the meantime, be patient.

1775
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:04,000
Mm-hmm.

1776
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:06,260
Protocols must be observed.

1777
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:09,960
...before initiation may commence.

1778
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:12,260
How I recognize this sign.

1779
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:12,700
Yeah.

1780
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,360
You will know.

1781
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:15,220
You will know.

1782
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:18,480
When you receive the invitation, bring it here.

1783
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:21,380
And your initiation shall begin.

1784
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:24,120
You're invited to the initiation.

1785
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:26,340
Okay.

1786
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:28,440
I'll wait for my...

1787
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:29,780
I'll wait for...

1788
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:31,880
I'll wait for my little card in the mail.

1789
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:33,720
Alright, now let's go see Stephanie.

1790
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:34,880
I

1791
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:13,400
don't know.

1792
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:15,800
My...

1793
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:15,960
Oh.

1794
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:18,240
My...

1795
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:21,880
Me-meet-meet-me-boy.

1796
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:27,080
Oh, he's gone.

1797
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:28,960
Almost made of leather.

1798
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:34,800
polyester is he upstairs oh hello mr.

1799
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:59,220
Potsdam guess I can forget about the meat huh what do you mean yeah what do you mean your dad must have pulled some strings be sure and check Stephanie's pillow you lucky bum what the hell are you talking about what does that mean yeah you'll see once the sheriff gets here Stephanie Stephanie what things will never be the same now Wait,

1800
02:09:59,620 --> 02:09:59,620
what?

1801
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:02,680
Guess I'll be watching TV nights.

1802
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:08,100
Okay, you can come in now, son.

1803
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:09,540
What happened?

1804
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:10,900
Stephanie dead?

1805
02:10:14,430 --> 02:10:15,170
Oh my god.

1806
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:16,610
Oh my god.

1807
02:10:16,730 --> 02:10:17,770
Is that what I think it is?

1808
02:10:18,150 --> 02:10:19,270
She's been reduced.

1809
02:10:19,290 --> 02:10:20,290
Yes, it's a spinal cord.

1810
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:21,470
Is it...

1811
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:22,070
Stephanie?

1812
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:26,830
I can see a resemblance, but I can't be sure.

1813
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:29,070
More pie, Sheriff.

1814
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:31,370
Pie.

1815
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:32,430
Skeletons knife!

1816
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:33,710
Don't you realize what's happened?

1817
02:10:36,630 --> 02:10:38,090
Oh, indeed I do.

1818
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:42,530
I can just hear the tongues wagging at the PTA.

1819
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:44,890
Was it?

1820
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:45,950
What?

1821
02:10:46,270 --> 02:10:46,830
Suicide.

1822
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:48,050
Wait.

1823
02:10:48,430 --> 02:10:51,790
I've never heard of anyone pulling their own spinal cord out before.

1824
02:10:52,510 --> 02:10:54,830
Off the record, I'd have to say, nope.

1825
02:10:55,950 --> 02:11:00,470
No, all in all, I'd say this was death by natural causes.

1826
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:31,930
natural causes natural causes you can't live without a spinal cord son nothing unnatural about that think i will have some more power no at least we got to woohoo with her i can't believe this this is horrible believe me you get to the point to where this is Routine.

1827
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:33,030
Routine!

1828
02:11:33,810 --> 02:11:36,110
There's like 50 people in this town!

1829
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:39,730
Now the only clue we got is that card on our pillow.

1830
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:43,470
Take a look at it.

1831
02:11:50,110 --> 02:11:51,570
This is practically a confession.

1832
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:53,290
Confession to what, son?

1833
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:54,670
Murder.

1834
02:11:55,090 --> 02:11:56,750
Isn't that what you're here to investigate?

1835
02:11:56,990 --> 02:11:58,410
We got our invitation.

1836
02:11:58,770 --> 02:12:00,870
Son, you don't investigate natural deaths.

1837
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:02,050
No point.

1838
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:05,270
Then I'll get to the bottom of this myself.

1839
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:06,570
I know.

1840
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:11,550
I'm sure you will.

1841
02:12:12,630 --> 02:12:13,110
Yummy.

1842
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:14,370
More pie, Sheriff.

1843
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:16,290
What?

1844
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:17,570
She's giving it to me.

1845
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:19,190
Don't mind if I do.

1846
02:12:20,650 --> 02:12:22,230
What did the actors think?

1847
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:23,810
I truly have to know.

1848
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:27,770
What did they think when they were filming this?

1849
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:30,630
Oh my.

1850
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:34,950
Steve is in Super Smash.

1851
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:42,770
Oh my god, I can't believe Jesus is just a skeleton.

1852
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:46,150
Oh my god!

1853
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:54,990
Oh, I guess I see why the guide told me to go talk to Stephanie before talking to the lodge.

1854
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:57,770
Because we would have been able to talk to her.

1855
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:00,870
But it's fine.

1856
02:13:03,130 --> 02:13:04,230
Oh, I see now.

1857
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:06,090
I thought I almost had a bad ending for it.

1858
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:07,330
second or something.

1859
02:13:07,650 --> 02:13:08,630
Why is it working?

1860
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:09,930
I don't know.

1861
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:14,490
She's just a skull and a little spine.

1862
02:13:17,490 --> 02:13:19,330
Oh my god.

1863
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:22,450
Just got back.

1864
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:23,050
How's Stephanie?

1865
02:13:24,570 --> 02:13:27,510
She's she's skinny.

1866
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:35,980
Examine the skull and the spine.

1867
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:38,340
I'm clicking.

1868
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,820
Oh, Oh, a lodge invitation.

1869
02:13:42,220 --> 02:13:42,760
Let's take that.

1870
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:43,140
Yoink.

1871
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:45,520
Can I take her too?

1872
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:47,580
A skull and a spinal cord.

1873
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:49,060
I died.

1874
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:53,620
Steve's model took being a kid or two seriously.

1875
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:54,860
What do you mean?

1876
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:00,480
The actors were thinking, God, I hope this check clears.

1877
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:02,200
Seriously.

1878
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:07,320
I am always thinking about the death by natural causes line.

1879
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:13,860
Oh, it's gotta be death by natural causes.

1880
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:16,500
Hello, Steve.

1881
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:17,720
Have some pie?

1882
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:22,520
Um, another skeleton in the family closet, eh?

1883
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:25,840
No, Steve.

1884
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:27,520
We're going to put her in the crypt.

1885
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:28,040
Oh!

1886
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:30,860
Keeping bodies in the house is just not sanitary.

1887
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:34,540
Must have been a moth, ma'am, because now she's now boneless.

1888
02:14:35,860 --> 02:14:36,040
No!

1889
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:59,210
driven to take their own spine it couldn't be i can't believe what was that with a line from that neil brain movie i can't believe you killed yourself i cannot believe you killed yourself why wait

1890
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:12,400

1891
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:13,400
Suicidal?

1892
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:14,420
Suicidal?

1893
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:15,200
Why?

1894
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:16,400
Suicidal?

1895
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:17,220
Oh, suicidal?

1896
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:18,260
Suicidal?

1897
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:19,580
Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

1898
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:25,600
That's what the mom was about to say.

1899
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:33,600
I don't suppose it'd hurt for you to take the card.

1900
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:36,020
Seeing as it was addressed to you.

1901
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:37,200
Yeah, I took it.

1902
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:40,460
I'm sorry I had to read it in the first place.

1903
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:42,040
But that's my job.

1904
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,520
I wonder if there's more pie.

1905
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:46,100
Why?

1906
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:47,860
The pie must be really good.

1907
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:49,380
What kind of pie is it, I wonder?

1908
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,320
It's probably a meat pie.

1909
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:54,080
Oh.

1910
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:55,440
You okay?

1911
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:56,180
What do you want?

1912
02:15:57,180 --> 02:16:02,200
You know, with a slaughterhouse full of meat in town, what kind of nutcase would steal a barber's?

1913
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:03,220
He's talking about the barber.

1914
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,760
Your daughter is dead!

1915
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:06,840
Pastorelli won't need it where he is.

1916
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:08,860
Sweetie Todd.

1917
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,880
Harvest will never be the same without DNA's diner.

1918
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:13,680
Or without DNA.

1919
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:23,420
for that matter it's kind of messed up they just call it dna diner it's not his it's not his name um

1920
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:46,400
okay well uh let's go to the lodge i can't i guess we're calling off the wedding no like you know what we saw what happens with married people so maybe it's for the best

1921
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:55,840
You received the invitation, but you have not brought it.

1922
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:57,300
Right, where?

1923
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:57,780
Oh.

1924
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:58,860
What?

1925
02:16:59,020 --> 02:16:59,800
I don't understand.

1926
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:00,600
What?

1927
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:04,200
The invitation was not the card.

1928
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:04,760
Ah.

1929
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:06,480
A spinal cord.

1930
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:09,200
It must be presented to me.

1931
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:12,260
Air, I allow you to enter.

1932
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:15,080
Uh...

1933
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:17,680
What have you done with Stephanie?

1934
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:18,440
Stephanie?

1935
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:22,500
They'll be, they'll get mad at me though.

1936
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:26,420
You expect me to steal the remains and bring them here?

1937
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:28,440
I expect nothing.

1938
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:31,500
What must unfold will...

1939
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:32,280
Okay.

1940
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:35,280
You were provided an invitation.

1941
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,520
The skull and the spinal cord.

1942
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:37,940
Okay, okay.

1943
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:45,760
I don't think this is the morgue guy unless he's putting on a crazy voice.

1944
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:48,280
How would we not recognize him?

1945
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:50,180
Go back.

1946
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:53,120
Unless she's at the cemetery already.

1947
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:57,340
Excuse me, everybody.

1948
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,560
Oh, no, she's gone!

1949
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:01,420
Oh.

1950
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:05,200
Stephanie, she had nice taste.

1951
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:08,360
Stephanie, my Stephanie.

1952
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:11,740
That's all I have to say about hers.

1953
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:14,040
She had nice taste.

1954
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:15,720
Okay.

1955
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:47,340
Yeah, and the crypt maybe or at the morgue we'll check both are you okay hello steve have some pie you don't happen to have stephanie's spine lying around do you no steve i'm so sorry you just missed it oh we just had her bones interred in the family vault in the cemetery oh dang okay stop by there if you want to pay your last respects but you can't get inside it's sealed when will it be back oh um i can i can Alright,

1956
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:48,280
I'll figure that out.

1957
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:55,340
I think we're just gonna embrace being a full-blown, uh, like, insane guy.

1958
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,860
We're just gonna, you know...

1959
02:19:01,650 --> 02:19:04,430
Stephanie, my Stephanie, I'm coming for you.

1960
02:19:05,570 --> 02:19:06,690
That's a spirit!

1961
02:19:08,330 --> 02:19:10,190
The marble doors have been sealed shut.

1962
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:13,950
Can I climb the tree?

1963
02:19:14,110 --> 02:19:19,150
The leaning sycamore is dead rotten and unstable for climbing or stringing nooses!

1964
02:19:19,570 --> 02:19:21,390
That's not what I was thinking.

1965
02:19:22,110 --> 02:19:22,470
Oh no.

1966
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:24,850
Um, oh.

1967
02:19:25,850 --> 02:19:27,270
Can I climb with this?

1968
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:28,310
Oh, here's the ladder!

1969
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:28,690
Okay.

1970
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:31,630
There's a skylight.

1971
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:34,790
A dim light shines through the glass skylight.

1972
02:19:37,450 --> 02:19:39,690
I'm breaking it.

1973
02:19:40,270 --> 02:19:40,650
Okay.

1974
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:46,760
Ah!

1975
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:47,720
Oh my god!

1976
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:49,840
Ah!

1977
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:50,460
Ah!

1978
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:51,000
Ah!

1979
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:51,360
Ah!

1980
02:19:51,900 --> 02:20:14,820
Uh, uh, uh, oh, I don't think my pistol has, uh, oh my god, what the hell was that?

1981
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:18,340
What

1982
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:26,580
was that?

1983
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,860
Wait, where's her operate the ladder back up?

1984
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:38,560
That was the biggest rat I've ever seen!

1985
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:45,840
Stephanie.

1986
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:49,480
A skull and spinal cord.

1987
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:50,200
Yoink.

1988
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:53,860
Okay.

1989
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:01,240
Okay.

1990
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:04,160
Let's uh...

1991
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:04,780
Let's head back.

1992
02:21:09,130 --> 02:21:11,370
Yeah, we just put that in our pocket.

1993
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:14,050
Easy storage.

1994
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:20,390
The way he walks with the axe.

1995
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:23,270
What's our health level?

1996
02:21:23,430 --> 02:21:24,450
I have no idea.

1997
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:27,030
Oh, maybe this is our health?

1998
02:21:28,050 --> 02:21:28,830
At the bottom?

1999
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:30,110
Not quite sure.

2000
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:32,730
How did I have it?

2001
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:56,530
You know, let the initiation commence as your mystagogue mystagogue requested and required that i turn over this sacred dagger sacred dagger oh my health is steve's photo okay okay whoa what is this

2002
02:22:00,020 --> 02:23:37,270

2003
02:23:39,130 --> 02:23:42,570
Just tell me, is Stephanie dead or being held within?

2004
02:23:43,410 --> 02:23:49,130
The membership director on the second level keeps track of such things.

2005
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:53,530
Oh great, then you are against me.

2006
02:23:54,310 --> 02:23:56,610
I am the sergeant at arms.

2007
02:23:57,090 --> 02:24:01,550
I am here to ensure that the protocols are absurd.

2008
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:02,250
Right.

2009
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:06,970
Deviation from a protocol shall result in punishment.

2010
02:24:08,250 --> 02:24:09,750
Remember what I have told you.

2011
02:24:09,810 --> 02:24:10,790
So we use the...

2012
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:13,890
Now let the initiation begin.

2013
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:14,610
Woohoo!

2014
02:24:16,010 --> 02:24:17,530
Oh my gosh, it's open!

2015
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:22,920
Another disk?

2016
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:24,600
Control F.

2017
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:26,120
Control...

2018
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:27,660
Wait, control...

2019
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,100
F4.

2020
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:30,400
Left click.

2021
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:34,080
There's another disk?

2022
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:35,780
Oh.

2023
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:38,320
Valet.

2024
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:40,180
Examine the bust.

2025
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:40,760
Okay, hold on.

2026
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:42,260
Before we do that, we're gonna save.

2027
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:44,860
We blasted through Disc 2.

2028
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:45,380
I know.

2029
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:48,060
Okay, um, is there more saves?

2030
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:48,420
No.

2031
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:50,660
So we're gonna have to start rewriting over things.

2032
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:55,120
I am...

2033
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:59,340
I... I'm gonna lose all my memories.

2034
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:01,100
Sad.

2035
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,160
Save often.

2036
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:02,580
Okay.

2037
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:13,950
Um, uh, lodge, lodging it up, baby, one.

2038
02:25:14,170 --> 02:25:15,310
Part one.

2039
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:18,210
Goodbye, Steve.

2040
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:18,530
Okay.

2041
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:20,850
Oh, you're here.

2042
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:21,450
Oh, my God!

2043
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:24,750
You'll find them through that door.

2044
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:25,770
Excuse me?

2045
02:25:26,110 --> 02:25:27,790
You are the exterminator.

2046
02:25:28,170 --> 02:25:28,870
Are you not?

2047
02:25:29,230 --> 02:25:29,630
No.

2048
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:34,450
In that case, I'm afraid you'll have a hard time of it, sir.

2049
02:25:35,690 --> 02:25:39,930
Recently, the lodge has become infested by pests.

2050
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:47,270
They need exterminating, or to be blunt, sir, they need killing.

2051
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:47,890
Okay.

2052
02:25:48,210 --> 02:25:49,130
And plenty of...

2053
02:25:49,130 --> 02:25:50,210
Oh, okay.

2054
02:25:50,610 --> 02:25:51,990
I didn't click anything.

2055
02:25:53,170 --> 02:25:53,470
Okay.

2056
02:25:56,490 --> 02:25:57,090
Um...

2057
02:25:57,090 --> 02:25:58,930
Oh, what's the quickest way to the second level?

2058
02:25:59,030 --> 02:25:59,190
Yeah.

2059
02:25:59,210 --> 02:26:00,490
The second floor, sir?

2060
02:26:01,110 --> 02:26:02,190
The entrance is hidden.

2061
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:02,670
Oh.

2062
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:05,670
But a little reflection should reveal the answer.

2063
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:06,170
Okay.

2064
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:12,090
To find the key to the second floor, reach deep within yourself.

2065
02:26:12,990 --> 02:26:14,250
I wish you good luck, sir.

2066
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:18,470
I only hope you can stomach what's ahead.

2067
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:19,670
Yeah, mirror probably.

2068
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:23,030
All right, so let's equip our...

2069
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:23,230
Oh!

2070
02:26:24,270 --> 02:26:27,730
We lost everything!

2071
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:29,110
Oh!

2072
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:30,830
I changed the music.

2073
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:34,790
This bust of Beethoven glares down at you in silent rebuke.

2074
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:42,990
Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Barbara Bush.

2075
02:26:43,570 --> 02:26:45,620
One of these things is not like the other.

2076
02:26:52,490 --> 02:26:54,210
Actually, maybe two of them.

2077
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:55,430
Sure.

2078
02:26:59,490 --> 02:27:01,050
Okay, wait, where do I go?

2079
02:27:02,330 --> 02:27:02,710
Go?

2080
02:27:07,050 --> 02:27:08,190
Where do I go?

2081
02:27:10,130 --> 02:27:10,890
Oh!

2082
02:27:11,570 --> 02:27:12,150
Oh!

2083
02:27:14,730 --> 02:27:15,010
Oh!

2084
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:16,070
Oh!

2085
02:27:16,590 --> 02:27:16,790
Oh!

2086
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:17,530
Oh!

2087
02:27:17,910 --> 02:27:18,110
Oh!

2088
02:27:18,630 --> 02:27:18,730
Oh!

2089
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:29,200
Okay, we're prepared now.

2090
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,640
Blueish veins line the mucus slick walls.

2091
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:34,900
Ooh!

2092
02:27:36,700 --> 02:27:38,640
Let's examine the floor.

2093
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:43,340
The surface underfoot is oddly spongy and fluid oozes up around your shoes where you step.

2094
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:52,700
Oh my god!

2095
02:27:56,460 --> 02:27:59,900
Okay, I'm just gonna save so that we can...

2096
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:02,700
Okay, lodging it up, baby, let's go!

2097
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:05,900
If we get attacked...

2098
02:28:09,370 --> 02:28:09,630
Oh!

2099
02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:12,070
It looks like a butthole.

2100
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:16,210
Exit, uh...

2101
02:28:16,210 --> 02:28:18,210
I can exit this way.

2102
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:24,440
Exit this way?

2103
02:28:26,020 --> 02:28:26,560
Ah!

2104
02:28:31,650 --> 02:28:34,270
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

2105
02:28:35,770 --> 02:28:37,710
Shell lodged deep in the porous wall.

2106
02:28:37,830 --> 02:28:39,710
It looks like a cocoon of some sort.

2107
02:28:41,910 --> 02:28:43,770
Oh yeah, easy, easy.

2108
02:28:43,770 --> 02:28:49,770
these examine

2109
02:28:53,540 --> 02:29:11,300
the mushroom a tomb tomb scent mushroom soaking in the puddle of bot what does that mean there's so many places to go wait okay let's go back the other way okay so they don't respawn that's kind of nice this way let's try this way

2110
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:26,190
Okay, how's my health?

2111
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:28,350
We're fine.

2112
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:33,620
A polyp grows stealthily.

2113
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:36,660
A tumorous growth erupting from the fleshy prison.

2114
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:37,020
Where?

2115
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:40,320
What is happening now?

2116
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:42,300
Why is...

2117
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:51,020
Um...

2118
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:53,380
Two fleshy.

2119
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:56,100
Four out of ten.

2120
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:01,040
Alright, let's keep going.

2121
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:04,520
We're doing a whole colonoscopy.

2122
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:05,620
What?

2123
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,560
This place is huge!

2124
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:09,520
Okay, hold on.

2125
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:10,600
I'm looking at the guide real quick.

2126
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:13,080
Kill all enemies with their harvester blade.

2127
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:15,700
Walk into the room with the eyeballs in it.

2128
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:18,940
Okay, where do I find such a place?

2129
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:22,780
Am I going?

2130
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:24,960
I can't tell if I'm looping or not, you know?

2131
02:30:27,940 --> 02:30:28,660
I can't.

2132
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:30,760
It looks like I'm looping, I think.

2133
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:34,340
Yeah, we're definitely looping.

2134
02:30:34,580 --> 02:30:36,300
Okay, so we gotta go through the hole.

2135
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:39,520
In here.

2136
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:43,360
Oh!

2137
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:44,800
Oh, what is this?

2138
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,360
Okay, okay, nice.

2139
02:30:52,660 --> 02:30:52,880
Okay.

2140
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:56,100
Examine the big eye.

2141
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:57,840
It's a big blue eye looking like it.

2142
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:58,760
right at you.

2143
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:02,360
And you thought the walls had ears.

2144
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:06,340
Funny.

2145
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:07,340
He's got jokes.

2146
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:09,520
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2147
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:15,090
Oh!

2148
02:31:19,150 --> 02:31:19,630
Oh.

2149
02:31:20,410 --> 02:31:24,310
Upon leaving the strange rooms behind, you notice a burning feeling in your skin.

2150
02:31:24,450 --> 02:31:27,750
You also notice a gooey film of slime covers your clothes.

2151
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:29,590
Are we okay?

2152
02:31:30,170 --> 02:31:31,310
We're fine.

2153
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:36,280
Okay.

2154
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:51,300
um wait okay it could be that you have acid on your clothes if that's the case you need to clean it off really quicker you'll die okay i'm reading the guide first enter the door in the middle how do i how do i clean it

2155
02:31:56,640 --> 02:32:06,720

2156
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,840
Okay, I'm just gonna follow the guide for this part, then.

2157
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:14,760
Holy cow, did I

2158
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:22,360
get bit?

2159
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:22,920
Uh-oh.

2160
02:32:23,100 --> 02:32:24,920
Wait, we're not so cheery anymore, guys.

2161
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:25,780
Ah!

2162
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:26,920
Kill the monster.

2163
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:29,660
Go to the... Go right into a bar.

2164
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Okay.

2165
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:32,320
Um, this way?

2166
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:32,900
Wait.

2167
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:34,280
I want to examine a little.

2168
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:39,760
They must have disagreed with something that ate him.

2169
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:40,340
Wait.

2170
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:41,540
What?

2171
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:42,260
Wait.

2172
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:47,400
I'm in a bar.

2173
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:51,660
A bar stocked with only domestic beers.

2174
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:56,660
It's a player piano with the inscription Chicago on it.

2175
02:32:58,600 --> 02:32:59,640
Okay, we're not looking so...

2176
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:00,740
We're not looking so hot.

2177
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:02,060
I don't want to die.

2178
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:05,900
We're suddenly Red Dead Redemption.

2179
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:06,800
Do I go in here?

2180
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:10,140
Um.

2181
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:11,500
What the hell is that?

2182
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:12,160
Oh.

2183
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:13,360
Feed me, Seymour.

2184
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:18,740
Oh, wait.

2185
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:19,280
Hold on.

2186
02:33:19,380 --> 02:33:20,000
We gotta go back.

2187
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:23,800
We gotta do the shells here.

2188
02:33:27,950 --> 02:33:28,710
Examine the beer.

2189
02:33:29,130 --> 02:33:29,670
Have a drink.

2190
02:33:30,130 --> 02:33:30,130
Oh.

2191
02:33:34,550 --> 02:33:35,590
Don't mind if I do.

2192
02:33:36,430 --> 02:33:37,890
You take the beer and drink it.

2193
02:33:39,470 --> 02:33:40,890
The strong beer.

2194
02:33:42,810 --> 02:33:44,270
You take the beer and drink it.

2195
02:33:44,430 --> 02:33:46,670
The room spins and your vision blurs momentarily.

2196
02:33:49,170 --> 02:33:49,370
Oh!

2197
02:33:51,250 --> 02:33:51,710
Ah!

2198
02:33:57,750 --> 02:33:58,390
Um...

2199
02:34:08,710 --> 02:34:11,330
We get to unlock something.

2200
02:34:11,610 --> 02:34:12,410
We got a small key.

2201
02:34:13,450 --> 02:34:13,690
Okay.

2202
02:34:14,590 --> 02:34:14,910
What?

2203
02:34:15,790 --> 02:34:16,890
What is going on?

2204
02:34:17,090 --> 02:34:17,890
A bar key.

2205
02:34:18,210 --> 02:34:18,490
Alright.

2206
02:34:18,710 --> 02:34:21,190
Is there a... something back here?

2207
02:34:23,830 --> 02:34:24,650
Maybe not.

2208
02:34:26,290 --> 02:34:26,930
Steevel.

2209
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:31,210
This is where we came from.

2210
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:32,950
Wait.

2211
02:34:33,470 --> 02:34:34,210
Examine the mirror.

2212
02:34:34,410 --> 02:34:37,490
This dust covering mirror reflects a darker image of yourself.

2213
02:34:38,270 --> 02:34:39,630
That's what we just killed!

2214
02:34:41,390 --> 02:34:41,590
Ah!

2215
02:34:41,970 --> 02:34:42,550
No, no!

2216
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:44,090
Ah!

2217
02:34:45,070 --> 02:34:47,770
How did we get a black eye from the acid?

2218
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:51,210
Wait, hold on.

2219
02:34:53,450 --> 02:34:56,030
The cash register in the back, did I miss it?

2220
02:34:56,710 --> 02:35:15,010
I don't want to save just yet because we wait I didn't see a cash register did you guys oh I don't see a cash register oh here here take

Japanese, ma'am.

2223
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:36,780
Yeah, now we just got to survive.

2224
02:36:37,060 --> 02:36:37,420
Okay, okay, okay.

2225
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:38,160
Cool.

2226
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:43,900
No more acid for me, thanks.

2227
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:45,800
I'm full.

2228
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:48,620
Examine the door.

2229
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:50,000
This door seems to be locked.

2230
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:51,060
There's a toga.

2231
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:53,720
The doft trappings of revelry.

2232
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:57,000
This toga whispers of good times past.

2233
02:36:57,240 --> 02:36:57,720
What?

2234
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:00,400
A hat box.

2235
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:03,500
empty but for the dead cockroach decaying in the corner.

2236
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:09,120
These waiting room chairs appear to have been lifted from a dentist's office.

2237
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:10,300
How could you tell?

2238
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:12,060
Empty clothes hanger.

2239
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:12,800
Okay, let's leave.

2240
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:15,900
Okay.

2241
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:22,920
Wait, we can kill that guy?

2242
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:27,020
I think I will.

2243
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:30,660
Oh.

2244
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:33,640
I acquired a shot gun.

2245
02:37:38,190 --> 02:37:38,410
Thank you.

2246
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:47,180
We got two rounds.

2247
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:52,600
Uh.

2248
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:54,860
Wait, put on...

2249
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:55,440
Hold on, sorry.

2250
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:57,620
I'm reading the guide because this part's scary.

2251
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:58,820
I don't want to mess anything out.

2252
02:37:59,360 --> 02:37:59,600
You know?

2253
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:01,940
Oh, now we can wear the toga.

2254
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:02,740
Can I put it on?

2255
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:08,550
Toga on me.

2256
02:38:09,410 --> 02:38:10,510
Man, I want to wear it.

2257
02:38:15,210 --> 02:38:15,650
Oh.

2258
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:18,590
Oh, it's a secret.

2259
02:38:24,350 --> 02:38:26,590
Yeah, Steve definitely has gamer posture.

2260
02:38:26,930 --> 02:38:27,630
He died of natural.

2261
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:28,410
Oh, he's gone!

2262
02:38:29,350 --> 02:38:30,590
They're so efficient here.

2263
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:40,160
Shotgun shells?

2264
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:45,880
Like rare gems, these shotgun shells have been secreted in the hidden room by someone who knew their value.

2265
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:48,180
Whoa!

2266
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:50,980
And we got a scythe!

2267
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:52,920
This scythe gleams harshly beneath the...

2268
02:38:52,940 --> 02:39:26,260
bear bulb yoink I wanted to wear the toga oh well okay um a cracked vase is a mirror do your save files name seem like names on a music album and now we are on the second disc of an extended special edition maybe right let's save again Cool.

2269
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:30,040
Let's go to the right.

2270
02:39:34,060 --> 02:39:35,440
How nice.

2271
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:36,240
A cow.

2272
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:40,140
The four eyes of this mutated cow blink disinterestly.

2273
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:41,580
Wait, they're blinking?

2274
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:43,880
Glistening in the firelight.

2275
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:47,860
Over a dozen books on animal husbandry.

2276
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:49,280
What does that mean?

2277
02:39:53,020 --> 02:39:53,740
Zootopia.

2278
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:58,740
authored by various leading Third Reich scientists.

2279
02:39:59,180 --> 02:39:59,540
Hmm?

2280
02:40:00,460 --> 02:40:01,620
A blazing fire.

2281
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:03,980
Animal.

2282
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,000
Raising animals.

2283
02:40:05,380 --> 02:40:06,200
Ah, okay.

2284
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:10,440
I thought we were marrying the animals.

2285
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:15,920
A pair of mutated horses pulling a cart filled with rhubarb.

2286
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:18,800
Stockyard mutated cat.

2287
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:19,860
Why are they all mutated?

2288
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:21,380
A duck.

2289
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:25,160
A brass duck sticking over the edge of a shelf.

2290
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:34,400
candle is still warm is there anything I can take I always forget like

2291
02:40:39,550 --> 02:41:01,010
disturbingly as you step over this rug you spy a brand mark seared into the fur oh my god oh my god the radio good old radio oh I think it just blinked that cow alright let's go We went this way, but let's go this way real quick.

2292
02:41:02,590 --> 02:41:03,050
Oh.

2293
02:41:04,310 --> 02:41:06,610
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.

2294
02:41:07,070 --> 02:41:07,950
Killing my clientele.

2295
02:41:08,630 --> 02:41:13,970
Ever since the monsters invaded this level, the members have taken to dining with the Grand Puba upstairs.

2296
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:17,970
Actually, I have to admit, my last few meals haven't been up to snow.

2297
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:21,930
The problem is the freshness of the corpses or lack thereof.

2298
02:41:22,110 --> 02:41:23,810
Is this not the guy from the meat house?

2299
02:41:24,430 --> 02:42:01,320
The sergeant at arms always used to insist that bodies killed in the lodge be disposed of without trays and so the members would bring me their business for preparation and dissemination resident evil we need the basement it is okay it is right what's behind all this killing oh dear you're not a member are you you're an initiative forgive me i can't say another word about it can you tell me anything that might help me not really oh um just got to see visuals of your May Cafe...

2300
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:01,940
Ah!

2301
02:42:02,700 --> 02:42:04,280
Wait, did they post it?

2302
02:42:05,380 --> 02:42:06,180
Nice thigh.

2303
02:42:06,500 --> 02:42:07,360
Sasuke oimum.

2304
02:42:07,640 --> 02:42:07,720
Ah!

2305
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:12,940
Um...

2306
02:42:12,940 --> 02:42:14,380
This will take you to the...

2307
02:42:14,380 --> 02:42:14,920
Okay, hold on.

2308
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:16,260
I'm reading the guide real quick.

2309
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:18,100
Talk to the chef and kill him if you want.

2310
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,520
Pick up a sandwich and eat it if your health is low.

2311
02:42:23,780 --> 02:42:25,200
Who's flushing the toilet?

2312
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:29,400
A cut of meat that no ordinary butcher would have a name for.

2313
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:31,580
Oh, I could take it.

2314
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:31,940
Doink.

2315
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:35,400
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.

2316
02:42:35,440 --> 02:42:36,300
Oh, you're saying the same thing.

2317
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:37,440
Ever since the...

2318
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:37,860
Just kidding.

2319
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:40,460
Actually, I have to admit, my last few meals haven't been up to snow.

2320
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:40,920
Oh, wait.

2321
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:44,520
The problem is the freshness of the corpses or lack thereof.

2322
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:46,320
Cannibalism, finally!

2323
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:49,800
The sergeant at arms always used to insist that bodies...

2324
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:52,600
Uh, do you know a girl named Stephanie?

2325
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:53,300
Sorry.

2326
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,340
You'd need to talk to the membership director up on two.

2327
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:58,560
Can you tell me anything that might help me?

2328
02:42:58,780 --> 02:42:59,600
Not really.

2329
02:42:59,800 --> 02:43:00,960
Not really.

2330
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:03,900
Uh, yoink.

2331
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:08,040
Wait, my health is kind of bad, so we'll eat the sandwich.

2332
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:10,960
Ham and cheese on rye.

2333
02:43:13,460 --> 02:43:14,440
Wait, can I eat it?

2334
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:16,820
Right click to eat.

2335
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:19,580
Oh.

2336
02:43:19,980 --> 02:43:21,200
Oh gosh.

2337
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:23,160
God, Steve.

2338
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:25,680
How do you like this?

2339
02:43:28,400 --> 02:44:04,780
This bottle is filled with a viscous red liquid which is clearly not anything as wholesome as ketchup okay well oh what's this what's it what's what's cooking a watched severed head never boils oh it is a man this sink is littered with dead bait this freshly removed hand still twitches reflexively grasping for salvation it's people we got it we We made it!

2340
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:06,140
We made it to cannibalism!

2341
02:44:06,300 --> 02:44:09,660
I figured this game had to have cannibalism.

2342
02:44:10,340 --> 02:44:11,800
It had to, it had to.

2343
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:13,360
Alright, now we can really save.

2344
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,260
Over that.

2345
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:17,840
Um...

2346
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:18,280
Awesome.

2347
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:20,800
Uh...

2348
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:22,480
Okay.

2349
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:25,860
Maybe let's go look at that plant.

2350
02:44:34,330 --> 02:44:36,030
I'm afraid this thing's gonna eat me.

2351
02:44:36,970 --> 02:44:38,650
The plant is blocking your way.

2352
02:44:39,510 --> 02:44:40,870
Can I cut the plant?

2353
02:44:40,910 --> 02:44:42,210
I don't want to shoot it.

2354
02:44:42,270 --> 02:44:43,110
I don't want to waste my bullets.

2355
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:05,380
Give it the arm?

2356
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:06,420
Yeah, right.

2357
02:45:12,090 --> 02:45:13,150
Wait, hold on.

2358
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:19,200
Oh, wait.

2359
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:20,780
The guide, hold on.

2360
02:45:20,980 --> 02:45:22,820
It's telling me to go back in here real second.

2361
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:26,400
The cloakroom and use the light switch.

2362
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:27,580
There was a light switch?

2363
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:29,640
I need something.

2364
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:30,440
Oh, there's a telephone.

2365
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:32,600
Old-fashioned telephone.

2366
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:34,220
There's a light switch somewhere?

2367
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:36,260
Oh, here.

2368
02:45:36,980 --> 02:45:37,800
Electric switch.

2369
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:40,520
Okay.

2370
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:41,520
Oh, okay.

2371
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:43,680
Gosh, this is why a guide is...

2372
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:51,580
My ears!

2373
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:55,560
Holy

2374
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:00,860
cow, it was scary.

2375
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:04,840
Slot machines.

2376
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:07,140
Some classic one-armed bandits.

2377
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:08,940
Wait, can I play?

2378
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:12,240
Winner!

2379
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:12,840
Winner!

2380
02:46:15,690 --> 02:46:16,650
Oh, yeah.

2381
02:46:18,250 --> 02:46:19,110
Pool table.

2382
02:46:19,350 --> 02:46:20,370
Someone scratched.

2383
02:46:21,130 --> 02:46:22,230
This looks like I can take it.

2384
02:46:22,750 --> 02:46:24,010
Riddled with teeth marks?

2385
02:46:25,390 --> 02:46:27,070
Who'd be biting on the pool?

2386
02:46:28,330 --> 02:46:30,270
And this is a baseball bat.

2387
02:46:30,390 --> 02:46:30,950
Batter up?

2388
02:46:31,350 --> 02:46:31,950
I'll take that.

2389
02:46:32,070 --> 02:46:32,270
Yoink.

2390
02:46:32,990 --> 02:46:34,590
What's lost in...

2391
02:46:35,150 --> 02:46:35,770
Gate.

2392
02:46:37,570 --> 02:46:39,110
Bruce M holds the high scores.

2393
02:46:40,310 --> 02:46:41,810
How much you want to bet that's like a dev?

2394
02:46:43,910 --> 02:46:45,650
The TV no Steve, yeah!

2395
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:53,670
The picture of Morris foot sucker McGee in the cradle.

2396
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:56,950
Okay.

2397
02:47:00,210 --> 02:47:00,470
Um.

2398
02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:01,770
Buckaroo.

2399
02:47:02,230 --> 02:47:03,030
I rip the guts.

2400
02:47:03,070 --> 02:47:03,610
Buckaroo.

2401
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:05,130
I rip the guts.

2402
02:47:05,130 --> 02:47:08,530
Most kids don't see godless heathen engines on a regular basis.

2403
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:09,890
And if they do, they've been...

2404
02:47:09,890 --> 02:47:10,190
All right.

2405
02:47:10,730 --> 02:47:11,350
What's in here?

2406
02:47:12,330 --> 02:47:12,830
Oh.

2407
02:47:16,990 --> 02:47:17,510
Um.

2408
02:47:24,030 --> 02:47:26,250
If I walk, is something gonna grab me?

2409
02:47:26,610 --> 02:47:27,370
There we go.

2410
02:47:27,690 --> 02:47:28,050
Whoa!

2411
02:47:36,270 --> 02:47:36,790
Okay.

2412
02:47:40,730 --> 02:47:41,770
What if...

2413
02:47:41,770 --> 02:47:43,490
I feed it?

2414
02:47:44,650 --> 02:47:45,390
You know?

2415
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:48,170
What if I give it a little bit of a meat?

2416
02:47:48,330 --> 02:47:49,350
There's more to come.

2417
02:47:50,350 --> 02:47:51,470
that I obtained.

2418
02:47:52,270 --> 02:47:53,110
This bad boy.

2419
02:47:59,210 --> 02:47:59,970
Okay, nice.

2420
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:01,810
How?

2421
02:48:02,050 --> 02:48:03,650
Okay, oh my gosh.

2422
02:48:03,790 --> 02:48:04,930
They, like, broke that rule.

2423
02:48:05,750 --> 02:48:16,730
I can't remember the rule right now, but for, like, movies, when you go to the left, you should enter through the right, but we went to the left and we entered through the left, so it just throws off your...

2424
02:48:16,730 --> 02:48:17,650
Okay, anyway.

2425
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:20,670
Yeah, the 180 rule.

2426
02:48:20,810 --> 02:48:21,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2427
02:48:25,790 --> 02:48:28,010
Cans of laxo veg.

2428
02:48:28,950 --> 02:48:29,170
Empty.

2429
02:48:31,210 --> 02:48:33,190
Why would anyone want to join the lodge?

2430
02:48:33,330 --> 02:48:35,490
I thought it was going to be really fancy and nice in here.

2431
02:48:35,710 --> 02:48:36,730
I don't know why.

2432
02:48:38,190 --> 02:48:39,670
It needs some incentive.

2433
02:48:40,310 --> 02:48:41,130
What's in the trash?

2434
02:48:41,530 --> 02:48:45,510
The roaches are crazed by the succulent riches contained herein.

2435
02:48:46,650 --> 02:48:48,170
You're always fun to watch and you're very funny.

2436
02:48:48,350 --> 02:48:48,710
What?

2437
02:48:48,990 --> 02:48:49,830
Thank you.

2438
02:48:50,030 --> 02:48:51,330
Thanks for 10 months.

2439
02:48:51,890 --> 02:48:52,650
Thank you.

2440
02:48:54,550 --> 02:48:56,510
So you don't participate in the blood drive.

2441
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:57,270
I guess that's true.

2442
02:48:59,310 --> 02:49:01,290
Wait, can we take this pipe like before?

2443
02:49:01,910 --> 02:49:01,910
No.

2444
02:49:02,650 --> 02:49:02,950
No.

2445
02:49:04,070 --> 02:49:04,610
Roller.

2446
02:49:06,070 --> 02:49:10,150
In lieu of toilet paper, please avail yourself to the lodge's own bidet.

2447
02:49:11,730 --> 02:49:13,490
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

2448
02:49:14,870 --> 02:49:18,990
The fluid leaking out from out of order toilet.

2449
02:49:19,230 --> 02:49:21,770
A little patience and good aim will save some trees.

2450
02:49:24,170 --> 02:49:25,630
What's in the bathtub?

2451
02:49:27,170 --> 02:49:31,390
The lodge version of an ancient Roman vomitorium.

2452
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:32,010
What?

2453
02:49:32,790 --> 02:49:33,710
What is that?

2454
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:35,870
They're empty.

2455
02:49:37,470 --> 02:49:37,470
Nothing.

2456
02:49:37,810 --> 02:49:38,690
Oh, weed killer!

2457
02:49:39,150 --> 02:49:40,870
This pesticide... Ah!

2458
02:49:41,230 --> 02:49:42,670
Wait, this is for the plant!

2459
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:43,670
Okay, nice.

2460
02:49:46,590 --> 02:49:47,950
Anything else in here?

2461
02:49:51,840 --> 02:49:54,100
Can I examine... Oh, the sink?

2462
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:57,300
Someone must have mistaken it for a toilet.

2463
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:57,920
Of course.

2464
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:01,460
I'll tell you though.

2465
02:50:02,840 --> 02:50:03,640
Girls bathrooms.

2466
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:06,520
If you've ever thought that they might be like cleaner or anything.

2467
02:50:06,860 --> 02:50:07,380
They're not.

2468
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:08,660
Girls bathrooms.

2469
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:11,760
Like public restrooms are usually so horrible.

2470
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:15,820
Thank you so much for the toilet.

2471
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:17,720
Thank you.

2472
02:50:18,140 --> 02:50:18,620
Thank you.

2473
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:19,180
Thank you.

2474
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:20,920
It's not.

2475
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,600
You would think like maybe like girls would be like so like.

2476
02:50:24,220 --> 02:50:25,420
I'm going to make it nice and clean.

2477
02:50:25,440 --> 02:50:27,900
No, they're not.

2478
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:30,440
They're really gross.

2479
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:34,420
My mom would tell me, it's kind of insane.

2480
02:50:35,580 --> 02:50:37,760
Bombatoriums were standing rooms for large clouds.

2481
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:38,580
Clouds.

2482
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:39,660
Crowds and buildings.

2483
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:41,420
They had nothing to do with puke.

2484
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:42,180
Oh, okay.

2485
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:44,680
The game is just silly then.

2486
02:50:46,360 --> 02:50:48,540
Oh, we have to...

2487
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:54,740
We have to use the other body.

2488
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:55,240
Oh!

2489
02:50:57,720 --> 02:50:58,640
Dang it.

2490
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:06,040
There is Buckaroo, right?

2491
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:07,440
Buckaroo?

2492
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:09,240
I didn't save.

2493
02:51:10,780 --> 02:51:13,900
I didn't know that I couldn't take a single step forward.

2494
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:17,360
Stay tuned, Buckaroos!

2495
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:20,800
All right, take that.

2496
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:23,240
Run, run, run, run, run.

2497
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:24,940
No, I will take it so much.

2498
02:51:25,820 --> 02:51:26,440
Where is that dog?

2499
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,160
Grab it.

2500
02:51:29,300 --> 02:51:29,920
Grab that.

2501
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:30,500
Grab that.

2502
02:51:31,040 --> 02:51:31,940
Grab it.

2503
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:34,800
And we leave.

2504
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:37,820
There's a snake in my boot.

2505
02:51:39,080 --> 02:51:40,860
Alright, here's your chunk of meat.

2506
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:42,680
It's a bust.

2507
02:51:46,550 --> 02:51:47,170
Okay, nice.

2508
02:51:47,770 --> 02:51:49,070
Alright, let's save again.

2509
02:51:49,250 --> 02:51:49,690
Save.

2510
02:51:54,090 --> 02:51:54,350
Save.

2511
02:51:57,150 --> 02:52:01,330
Apparently we can eat this bubblegum if our health is low, so keep that in mind.

2512
02:52:02,710 --> 02:52:04,630
Alright, I think we've done everything that I've done.

2513
02:52:06,530 --> 02:52:07,510
I'm double checking.

2514
02:52:10,910 --> 02:52:11,870
We'd kill her on the plant.

2515
02:52:12,130 --> 02:52:12,510
Let's go.

2516
02:52:15,070 --> 02:52:15,410
Let's go.

2517
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:15,870
Let's go.

2518
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:16,390
Let's go.

2519
02:52:26,780 --> 02:52:33,220
A cleaning lady at work tells supervisors who tell us in the morning meeting that the ladies need to stop leaving toilet paper in the corner of the back.

2520
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:34,500
Why did I do that?

2521
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:41,580
I'm going to destroy these bathrooms, then Pito save.

2522
02:52:43,900 --> 02:52:45,680
Now, what does that mean?

2523
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:49,740
I

2524
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:56,640
didn't think I would take such a big step forward.

2525
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:58,120
My bad.

2526
02:53:01,440 --> 02:53:02,040
Buckaroo?

2527
02:53:04,440 --> 02:53:05,760
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

2528
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:06,720
Oh, man.

2529
02:53:06,980 --> 02:53:08,060
I love the...

2530
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Stay tuned, buckaroos.

2531
02:53:11,220 --> 02:53:13,000
Stay tuned, buckaroos!

2532
02:53:19,410 --> 02:53:21,410
They'd throw fireball whiskey balls.

2533
02:53:21,430 --> 02:53:24,070
bottles into the used box.

2534
02:53:24,290 --> 02:53:25,970
What is crazy?

2535
02:53:26,910 --> 02:53:33,010
I once worked at a mini golf place and I had to clean the bathrooms there too.

2536
02:53:34,010 --> 02:53:38,270
And always the ladies room was so wild.

2537
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:44,030
I think maybe, I don't know if it was like a, like a, what's it called?

2538
02:53:46,850 --> 02:53:53,510
Because like the moms were bringing their kids in there or something and then they would just be like, I'm too busy to clean up after myself.

2539
02:53:56,390 --> 02:53:57,430
New lore.

2540
02:53:57,870 --> 02:53:58,610
Have I never told you?

2541
02:54:03,050 --> 02:54:04,950
A million jobs, I think.

2542
02:54:12,480 --> 02:54:14,540
Yeah, and stay down.

2543
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:16,460
Examine the gate.

2544
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:17,340
A closed gate.

2545
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:17,940
Oh, wait.

2546
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:19,420
Oh, we go in there.

2547
02:54:20,020 --> 02:54:20,080
Oh.

2548
02:54:23,060 --> 02:54:24,360
This is new.

2549
02:54:28,800 --> 02:54:31,000
Mint worked at mini golf.

2550
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:59,640
it was cool it was like a themed one so it had like a really fun aesthetic i liked working there it was fun it wasn't bad it looks more alien than plant-like examine the fountain the once beautiful fountain needs a gardener the weeds have taken over oh operate the fountain okay

2551
02:55:04,260 --> 02:55:04,820
Okay.

2552
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:10,740
Am I pixel hunting?

2553
02:55:11,800 --> 02:55:12,360
Oh,

2554
02:55:20,460 --> 02:55:20,460
wait.

2555
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:20,760
Wait.

2556
02:55:21,220 --> 02:55:21,660
Where was that?

2557
02:55:21,940 --> 02:55:23,240
What was that?

2558
02:55:23,560 --> 02:55:24,100
What was that?

2559
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:24,240
What was that?

2560
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:26,300
I missed... Wait.

2561
02:55:26,620 --> 02:55:27,080
I had it.

2562
02:55:29,920 --> 02:55:30,140
Oh, wait.

2563
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:31,660
Examine.

2564
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:32,320
Ah!

2565
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:33,600
Ah!

2566
02:55:34,020 --> 02:55:34,300
Examine!

2567
02:55:35,080 --> 02:55:36,320
Examine the fountain key!

2568
02:55:36,760 --> 02:55:37,940
Oh, a key at the bottom.

2569
02:55:37,960 --> 02:55:38,960
of the fountain.

2570
02:55:41,380 --> 02:55:42,780
Oh my gosh.

2571
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:46,640
Is it...

2572
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:47,680
Is there a...

2573
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:48,740
Is there a...

2574
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:50,100
A keyhole somewhere?

2575
02:55:56,450 --> 02:55:58,250
Is there a keyhole somewhere?

2576
02:55:58,790 --> 02:56:00,370
I don't remember a locked door.

2577
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:05,620
Fountain key.

2578
02:56:13,590 --> 02:56:14,610
Is it in here?

2579
02:56:22,180 --> 02:56:23,940
His face is killing me.

2580
02:56:27,780 --> 02:56:28,220
Um...

2581
02:56:28,220 --> 02:56:29,400
Oh, I was standing!

2582
02:56:29,780 --> 02:56:32,120
Wait, oh, I thought I was standing right in front of it, just kidding.

2583
02:56:32,760 --> 02:56:33,260
Oh, wait.

2584
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:34,440
Uh...

2585
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:37,040
Examine the hole!

2586
02:56:38,300 --> 02:56:39,920
Like, you can't even see it!

2587
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:41,720
Actually, my head is blocking it, too.

2588
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:45,220
So you guys wouldn't have seen it.

2589
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:46,520
Ah!

2590
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:48,000
We opened up a door.

2591
02:56:51,300 --> 02:56:51,560
Ah!

2592
02:56:51,880 --> 02:56:52,320
Oh!

2593
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:53,580
Oh!

2594
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:57,000
Sweet cow.

2595
02:56:57,520 --> 02:56:58,240
Did he get me?

2596
02:56:58,380 --> 02:56:59,480
Nah, we're fine.

2597
02:57:05,100 --> 02:57:05,620
Shisha!

2598
02:57:12,210 --> 02:57:13,810
You killed the cyber demon!

2599
02:57:14,730 --> 02:57:17,010
Why are we suddenly in like doom?

2600
02:57:21,430 --> 02:57:22,350
What's here?

2601
02:57:22,750 --> 02:57:23,010
Anything?

2602
02:57:23,610 --> 02:57:23,730
Oh.

2603
02:57:25,770 --> 02:57:27,730
Fowl smelling liquid.

2604
02:57:29,930 --> 02:57:30,770
Examine the rope?

2605
02:57:32,170 --> 02:57:33,350
Rotting piece of plywood.

2606
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:35,730
What's the rope?

2607
02:57:36,670 --> 02:57:38,450
This rope looks dirty enough to climb!

2608
02:57:39,150 --> 02:57:43,190
As you grab the rope, you hear a scream.

2609
02:57:43,350 --> 02:57:44,790
Quickly, you climb up to investigate.

2610
02:57:47,690 --> 02:57:48,730
Oh, hello.

2611
02:57:49,010 --> 02:57:49,630
Art curator?

2612
02:57:50,650 --> 02:57:52,930
Welcome to the Harvest Moon Art Gallery, sir.

2613
02:57:53,710 --> 02:57:55,490
I'm the curator of this place.

2614
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:57,790
So delighted you could come.

2615
02:58:00,950 --> 02:58:04,050
Um, I expect it'll be an engaging experience.

2616
02:58:04,590 --> 02:58:06,150
That it will, I'm afraid.

2617
02:58:06,670 --> 02:58:10,370
Art often forces engagement, doesn't it?

2618
02:58:11,110 --> 02:58:14,330
Lovely works, pastoral scenes, noble sculptures.

2619
02:58:15,130 --> 02:58:17,070
These are easy on the eye and mind.

2620
02:58:17,930 --> 02:58:24,730
But when confronted with a work of hideous form, we're forced to deal with it, even if only to dismiss it as trash.

2621
02:58:26,230 --> 02:58:29,710
Sadly, the most extreme works are the hardest to dismiss.

2622
02:58:32,150 --> 02:58:33,230
Proteskerism it works of evil.

2623
02:58:33,230 --> 02:58:34,830
Oh, no, we got another yapper.

2624
02:58:37,550 --> 02:58:42,150
Nevertheless, it's important that each individual determine his own sense of aesthetics.

2625
02:58:42,670 --> 02:58:44,350
I don't think this is the top hat, man.

2626
02:58:44,530 --> 02:58:45,690
I think I had a beard, no?

2627
02:58:46,310 --> 02:58:47,670
There's no way he could get rid of that.

2628
02:58:48,210 --> 02:58:48,810
It's not possible.

2629
02:58:49,830 --> 02:58:51,390
I'm just passing through.

2630
02:58:51,910 --> 02:58:53,450
If only it were that simple.

2631
02:58:53,570 --> 02:58:54,690
I'm just passing through.

2632
02:59:00,920 --> 02:59:02,560
Well, actually, we didn't...

2633
02:59:03,260 --> 02:59:04,400
We could just save here again.

2634
02:59:04,920 --> 02:59:05,320
Okay, cool.

2635
02:59:06,040 --> 02:59:06,920
All right.

2636
02:59:07,240 --> 02:59:07,720
All right.

2637
02:59:07,860 --> 02:59:08,640
Let's, uh...

2638
02:59:09,460 --> 02:59:11,400
A very disturbing painting.

2639
02:59:11,560 --> 02:59:12,000
Is it?

2640
02:59:12,960 --> 02:59:14,380
Dark and mysterious.

2641
02:59:14,820 --> 02:59:15,800
Okay, that one I'll agree with.

2642
02:59:19,390 --> 02:59:20,030
What's it say?

2643
02:59:20,950 --> 02:59:21,390
What's it say?

2644
02:59:21,510 --> 02:59:22,650
Oh, no telling.

2645
02:59:24,670 --> 02:59:25,070
Okay.

2646
02:59:25,390 --> 02:59:25,870
Oh, wait.

2647
02:59:27,510 --> 02:59:28,990
I want to see what this...

2648
02:59:28,990 --> 02:59:29,410
Okay.

2649
02:59:30,250 --> 02:59:30,250
Anyway.

2650
02:59:35,530 --> 02:59:36,150
Sculpture.

2651
02:59:36,850 --> 02:59:38,030
Sickingly offensive.

2652
02:59:38,670 --> 02:59:39,750
Am I missing something?

2653
02:59:41,390 --> 02:59:42,630
Is it...

2654
02:59:45,670 --> 02:59:48,650
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

2655
02:59:48,990 --> 02:59:53,290
Oh, as the statue crashes to the floor, a small key is dropped.

2656
02:59:53,790 --> 02:59:54,630
You pick up the key.

2657
02:59:55,310 --> 02:59:56,570
Wait, did I take some damage though?

2658
02:59:56,750 --> 02:59:57,490
Oh, no!

2659
02:59:58,210 --> 02:59:59,430
We took big damage.

2660
02:59:59,710 --> 03:00:00,870
I tried to leave.

2661
03:00:03,190 --> 03:00:03,570
Dang.

2662
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:05,210
Okay, well, we got a key.

2663
03:00:06,950 --> 03:00:07,370
Um...

2664
03:00:08,590 --> 03:00:10,590
Hold on, I'm gonna look at the walkthrough real quick.

2665
03:00:12,170 --> 03:00:12,430
Oh.

2666
03:00:13,270 --> 03:00:14,670
unlock the door in the gallery.

2667
03:00:14,890 --> 03:00:15,350
There's a door?

2668
03:00:16,950 --> 03:00:18,710
Oh, it says kill all the living statues.

2669
03:00:18,910 --> 03:00:19,930
Okay, there's more than one.

2670
03:00:20,210 --> 03:00:20,830
Okay, okay, okay.

2671
03:00:21,210 --> 03:00:21,910
Did you eat the gum?

2672
03:00:22,110 --> 03:00:22,770
I didn't.

2673
03:00:25,470 --> 03:00:26,370
Strangely calming.

2674
03:00:26,870 --> 03:00:28,610
Looks like it was painted with fresh blood.

2675
03:00:30,050 --> 03:00:30,450
Wait, wait, wait.

2676
03:00:34,070 --> 03:00:35,030
Oh, a cow!

2677
03:00:36,150 --> 03:00:37,790
Roughly hone in jade.

2678
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:39,990
Perverse...

2679
03:00:39,990 --> 03:00:41,930
Perversely abstract.

2680
03:00:43,090 --> 03:00:43,250
Okay.

2681
03:00:43,270 --> 03:00:45,250
What are you seeing?

2682
03:00:46,090 --> 03:00:49,150
Am I just not artistically inclined, you think?

2683
03:00:50,110 --> 03:00:51,470
Yeah, we did just save, so...

2684
03:00:51,810 --> 03:00:53,650
One does not simply walk through the gallery.

2685
03:00:55,610 --> 03:00:56,490
Another statue?

2686
03:00:56,850 --> 03:00:56,850
Yeah.

2687
03:00:57,070 --> 03:00:57,210
Oh!

2688
03:00:59,810 --> 03:01:01,150
Oh, I think I wasted a boat.

2689
03:01:01,650 --> 03:01:02,770
Wait, this must be the door.

2690
03:01:04,070 --> 03:01:04,850
The door is locked.

2691
03:01:05,270 --> 03:01:05,270
Yeah.

2692
03:01:05,830 --> 03:01:06,570
This must be it.

2693
03:01:09,030 --> 03:01:09,810
Hat, dag!

2694
03:01:10,810 --> 03:01:15,270
Find the door between two ash trays There's a chest master is located.

2695
03:01:15,410 --> 03:01:15,950
What does that mean?

2696
03:01:18,410 --> 03:01:18,850
Minigolf?

2697
03:01:19,310 --> 03:01:20,150
Isn't that regular size?

2698
03:01:20,350 --> 03:01:21,150
Shut up!

2699
03:01:21,290 --> 03:01:22,610
Wait, was that not the key?

2700
03:01:23,110 --> 03:01:23,710
Hold on.

2701
03:01:25,630 --> 03:01:26,630
I think I was in the way.

2702
03:01:31,910 --> 03:01:33,170
B-17s in flight.

2703
03:01:33,510 --> 03:01:36,010
What is their obsession with B-17s?

2704
03:01:36,110 --> 03:01:37,270
Strange group of guys.

2705
03:01:37,570 --> 03:01:41,190
Wait, I just realized we didn't do anything with that military guy.

2706
03:01:44,650 --> 03:01:47,190
Was I supposed to, or...

2707
03:01:47,930 --> 03:01:49,230
Heavy and intimidating.

2708
03:01:54,380 --> 03:01:54,500
Oh!

2709
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:57,880
Oh no, we're out!

2710
03:01:58,540 --> 03:01:59,340
We're out of bullets.

2711
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:06,000
I guess I didn't need to do anything, or rather...

2712
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:09,140
Oh, it just is a whole loop.

2713
03:02:12,760 --> 03:02:13,980
I really wasted my time.

2714
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:14,600
my bullets.

2715
03:02:15,120 --> 03:02:16,120
That's okay, though.

2716
03:02:19,140 --> 03:02:19,800
B-17.

2717
03:02:19,980 --> 03:02:20,400
Bomber!

2718
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:25,420
I did get shot by him.

2719
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:32,100
His quest was to...

2720
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:33,300
Actually, I guess I didn't.

2721
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:36,040
It was, like, to investigate the guys at the fire...

2722
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:38,400
At the firehouse, but I didn't do that.

2723
03:02:39,060 --> 03:02:39,680
Aw, man.

2724
03:02:42,780 --> 03:02:43,240
Oh.

2725
03:02:43,840 --> 03:02:45,060
This is where I came from?

2726
03:02:45,560 --> 03:02:46,020
Okay.

2727
03:02:46,040 --> 03:02:46,520
Okay.

2728
03:02:50,530 --> 03:02:51,130
Uh...

2729
03:02:52,710 --> 03:02:53,310
Uh...

2730
03:02:53,310 --> 03:02:53,910
What's in here?

2731
03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:55,970
Oh!

2732
03:02:56,810 --> 03:02:57,210
Hello.

2733
03:02:57,350 --> 03:02:58,530
Can I help you?

2734
03:02:58,910 --> 03:03:00,050
I'm looking for a girl.

2735
03:03:00,510 --> 03:03:02,650
This is a library, not a brothel.

2736
03:03:03,430 --> 03:03:04,310
You don't understand.

2737
03:03:04,590 --> 03:03:05,410
I have reason.

2738
03:03:06,010 --> 03:03:08,610
I hope to believe that she was brought here.

2739
03:03:09,490 --> 03:03:11,210
Do you know anything about that?

2740
03:03:11,670 --> 03:03:12,910
I'm afraid not.

2741
03:03:13,310 --> 03:03:15,370
I tend to stay out of lodge affairs.

2742
03:03:15,890 --> 03:03:17,670
I'm only in charge of the library.

2743
03:03:17,690 --> 03:03:47,950
oh okay well if she is here she's not been invited as a member there are no female members of the order to be sure one or two have qualified throughout our history but they're generally not of our caliber a your one though no I doubt there are any females in this building my own at least none that are extant but you're a woman I'm not a member all women are kept here for the services they gender.

2744
03:03:48,890 --> 03:03:54,150
Just as some jobs are beneath men, so too can certain services only be supplied by women.

2745
03:03:54,150 --> 03:03:55,570
No man will ever be a librarian.

2746
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:58,170
If she is here, you'll find her on the third floor.

2747
03:03:58,310 --> 03:03:58,830
Third floor!

2748
03:03:58,830 --> 03:04:01,550
Which you'll have difficulty finding without my help.

2749
03:04:01,790 --> 03:04:01,970
Oh.

2750
03:04:02,330 --> 03:04:05,050
And you want something in return.

2751
03:04:06,330 --> 03:04:15,430
I'll give you a clue as to how to get to the third floor, but only if you'll retrieve an overdue book from one of our charter members, a Mr. Kane.

2752
03:04:15,510 --> 03:04:16,170
Mr. Kane.

2753
03:04:17,690 --> 03:04:19,350
highly regarded among the order.

2754
03:04:20,110 --> 03:04:22,930
I'm loath to approach him on such an embarrassing matter.

2755
03:04:23,050 --> 03:04:23,530
I see.

2756
03:04:24,190 --> 03:04:26,450
Therefore, bring me the book, and I'll help you.

2757
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:28,410
How will I know which book?

2758
03:04:28,930 --> 03:04:29,830
Oh, you'll know it.

2759
03:04:30,090 --> 03:04:31,490
He's not an avid reader.

2760
03:04:31,790 --> 03:04:32,370
Got it.

2761
03:04:32,710 --> 03:04:33,050
All right.

2762
03:04:33,930 --> 03:04:35,390
A book, you say.

2763
03:04:39,130 --> 03:04:39,610
Whoa.

2764
03:04:40,910 --> 03:04:41,390
Whoa.

2765
03:04:42,310 --> 03:04:43,610
Okay, I'm going to save.

2766
03:04:44,210 --> 03:04:46,050
But I kind of...

2767
03:04:46,050 --> 03:04:47,590
We'll save a new save just in case.

2768
03:04:47,790 --> 03:04:48,270
I die.

2769
03:04:52,130 --> 03:04:52,730
Um...

2770
03:04:54,690 --> 03:04:57,430
It's probably Dojinchi.

2771
03:05:02,220 --> 03:05:03,400
Examine the door.

2772
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:04,360
The door is locked.

2773
03:05:04,820 --> 03:05:06,600
The door is barred from the other side.

2774
03:05:11,630 --> 03:05:12,590
Wait, what's this way?

2775
03:05:13,290 --> 03:05:14,490
Wait, this area is huge!

2776
03:05:16,330 --> 03:05:16,790
Okay.

2777
03:05:18,790 --> 03:05:19,390
Oh.

2778
03:05:21,370 --> 03:05:24,370
Why does this feel like a liminal space in a way?

2779
03:05:25,530 --> 03:05:27,570
Oh, oh, what is this?

2780
03:05:30,390 --> 03:05:30,430
Oh.

2781
03:05:30,550 --> 03:05:31,030
Excuse me.

2782
03:05:31,390 --> 03:05:32,490
You can't come in right now.

2783
03:05:32,610 --> 03:05:33,510
I just mopped the floor.

2784
03:05:36,250 --> 03:05:39,490
You think just because I'm a janitor, I got no pride?

2785
03:05:40,590 --> 03:05:43,390
That's all I got to do all day is clean up after you rich bastards.

2786
03:05:43,850 --> 03:05:45,030
Take a hike before you get hurt.

2787
03:05:46,430 --> 03:05:47,170
All right, buddy.

2788
03:05:47,890 --> 03:05:49,170
You act for it.

2789
03:05:49,230 --> 03:05:50,350
Oh, no, I act for it.

2790
03:05:51,670 --> 03:05:52,070
Oh.

2791
03:05:53,230 --> 03:05:53,630
Oh.

2792
03:06:12,110 --> 03:06:15,190
Actually, I didn't even try going forward anymore.

2793
03:06:15,350 --> 03:06:20,090
It's because I was just holding the right key and it like, it like kept the inputs.

2794
03:06:24,910 --> 03:06:28,010
So, um, I didn't even do anything.

2795
03:06:29,870 --> 03:06:31,170
Oh, the size, that's right.

2796
03:06:31,270 --> 03:06:32,310
We did get the size.

2797
03:06:32,830 --> 03:06:33,350
I forgot.

2798
03:06:34,630 --> 03:06:35,210
Thank you.

2799
03:06:35,290 --> 03:06:35,630
Yeah.

2800
03:06:37,850 --> 03:06:39,290
Hello, it's in here.

2801
03:06:41,010 --> 03:06:41,970
Membership director.

2802
03:06:42,590 --> 03:06:42,750
Hello!

2803
03:06:43,390 --> 03:06:44,230
Let me see.

2804
03:06:44,950 --> 03:06:46,530
Oh yes, the new initiate.

2805
03:06:47,450 --> 03:06:48,890
I'm the lodge membership director.

2806
03:06:49,170 --> 03:06:50,730
What can I do for you?

2807
03:06:51,670 --> 03:06:52,990
Could you help me out a little?

2808
03:06:53,550 --> 03:06:56,310
Shortly you will run into a fellow named Mr. Kane.

2809
03:06:56,330 --> 03:06:56,910
Mr. Kane!

2810
03:06:57,170 --> 03:06:59,150
He has the strength of the truly insane.

2811
03:07:00,290 --> 03:07:01,850
You will need help to get past him.

2812
03:07:02,830 --> 03:07:06,570
They say that music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.

2813
03:07:06,890 --> 03:07:07,410
Breast?

2814
03:07:08,170 --> 03:07:08,450
Beast?

2815
03:07:09,070 --> 03:07:09,210
Wait.

2816
03:07:09,610 --> 03:07:13,050
But an appreciation of music may net you something, it will.

2817
03:07:15,810 --> 03:07:16,490
Breast.

2818
03:07:21,660 --> 03:07:23,100
Decorative swords.

2819
03:07:25,660 --> 03:07:28,260
Photographs of vaguely familiar strangers.

2820
03:07:32,310 --> 03:07:32,590
Okay.

2821
03:07:34,150 --> 03:07:34,790
That's what we need.

2822
03:07:35,830 --> 03:07:36,550
Is he in here?

2823
03:07:38,110 --> 03:07:39,970
I love the way he walks.

2824
03:07:41,450 --> 03:07:41,830
Whoa.

2825
03:07:52,690 --> 03:07:54,050
An ornate vine.

2826
03:07:55,530 --> 03:07:57,370
We got to play something nice.

2827
03:07:58,990 --> 03:07:59,350
Beautiful ground.

2828
03:07:59,410 --> 03:08:00,550
Oh, what just happened?

2829
03:08:02,030 --> 03:08:02,350
Oh.

2830
03:08:03,190 --> 03:08:03,350
Oh.

2831
03:08:03,630 --> 03:08:04,610
I don't think I can walk.

2832
03:08:05,670 --> 03:08:05,810
Wait.

2833
03:08:07,490 --> 03:08:09,750
Oh, I think we're trapped a little.

2834
03:08:10,350 --> 03:08:11,070
Okay, I left.

2835
03:08:15,280 --> 03:08:17,520
And I can't go this way, so I'll have to go this way.

2836
03:08:18,820 --> 03:08:19,220
Hmm.

2837
03:08:19,340 --> 03:08:20,500
I wonder what he'll request.

2838
03:08:26,290 --> 03:08:29,250
Okay, we can only keep going this way.

2839
03:08:30,610 --> 03:08:32,370
I think I went this way, right?

2840
03:08:33,410 --> 03:08:36,070
Yes, that's the room where I got shot.

2841
03:08:37,370 --> 03:08:38,170
So let's go forward.

2842
03:08:41,510 --> 03:08:41,890
Ash tray.

2843
03:08:42,410 --> 03:08:44,930
A rook-shaped ash tray.

2844
03:08:45,230 --> 03:08:46,910
Is that blood on the door or...

2845
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:53,280
Is that blood on the door or...

2846
03:08:53,840 --> 03:08:55,260
Oh, he'll probably ask me.

2847
03:08:55,280 --> 03:08:56,260
for baby shark.

2848
03:08:57,300 --> 03:08:59,800
No, you know that one song that you can do with your knuckles?

2849
03:09:00,200 --> 03:09:00,540
The...

2850
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:07,500
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

2851
03:09:08,280 --> 03:09:09,570
That's what I'll play.

2852
03:09:12,020 --> 03:09:12,760
Go in!

2853
03:09:13,660 --> 03:09:14,020
Hello?

2854
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:16,460
Oh.

2855
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:20,760
An excellent likeness in oil.

2856
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:24,800
A reflection of an excellent likeness in oil.

2857
03:09:25,500 --> 03:09:27,120
Wait, I don't know chess.

2858
03:09:28,840 --> 03:09:29,220
Oh no.

2859
03:09:30,180 --> 03:09:31,780
An intellectual arena.

2860
03:09:32,460 --> 03:09:32,920
Oh no.

2861
03:09:34,600 --> 03:09:36,440
I am a chess master.

2862
03:09:36,640 --> 03:09:37,920
Oh, this is not the voice I expected.

2863
03:09:38,180 --> 03:09:42,980
Any initiate who wishes to pass this way must do so over my dead body.

2864
03:09:43,080 --> 03:09:43,440
Okay.

2865
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:47,600
Being a civilized man, I offer my opponents a choice.

2866
03:09:48,880 --> 03:09:51,700
Solve my problem or fight me to the death.

2867
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:54,520
Do you know how to play chess?

2868
03:09:55,740 --> 03:09:56,440
No.

2869
03:09:57,580 --> 03:10:00,280
Chess is a civilized game.

2870
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:01,160
We're gonna kill him.

2871
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:07,460
How sad that we must now resort to a less civilized form of conflict.

2872
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:08,760
Oh, oh no!

2873
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:11,480
What the hell?

2874
03:10:14,990 --> 03:10:16,800
I missed the cutscene.

2875
03:10:17,320 --> 03:10:18,020
Oh.

2876
03:10:22,130 --> 03:10:23,390
How did that happen?

2877
03:10:30,180 --> 03:10:31,100
What's he got?

2878
03:10:34,590 --> 03:10:35,770
I'll take that.

2879
03:10:36,790 --> 03:10:38,030
All right.

2880
03:10:38,570 --> 03:10:39,950
Why don't we take the axe too?

2881
03:10:41,930 --> 03:10:42,350
Checkmate.

2882
03:10:44,490 --> 03:10:46,440
A special memorial mirror honored...

2883
03:10:47,370 --> 03:10:54,130
honoring the chess master as Mr. Quengeaniality at the All-American Chess Playoffs and Swimsuit Competition.

2884
03:10:56,530 --> 03:11:06,050
First place trophy in the cabinet makers Union Chapter 501 Special Chess Olympics for differently able spinal injury victims.

2885
03:11:08,690 --> 03:11:10,270
Where does this key go to?

2886
03:11:16,500 --> 03:11:22,480
First place trophy in the St. Mark's Children's Hospital Burn Ward chock full of chess festival.

2887
03:11:25,460 --> 03:11:27,500
I got the chess key.

2888
03:11:37,900 --> 03:11:40,000
Maybe it's a room that... Wait, I'm on.

2889
03:11:40,780 --> 03:11:41,520
Oh, shoot.

2890
03:11:42,040 --> 03:11:42,060
Oh,

2891
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:48,360
shoot.

2892
03:11:48,800 --> 03:11:53,900
Okay, well, I didn't say before the Chess Master, so we'll have to do that again.

2893
03:11:56,560 --> 03:11:57,440
One badge!

2894
03:11:58,400 --> 03:12:00,740
Well, we'll get to see the cutscene then, that's fine.

2895
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:03,200
Oh, I got stuck here, that's right, okay.

2896
03:12:04,040 --> 03:12:09,780
No, no, no, no, there we go.

2897
03:12:21,360 --> 03:12:21,680
Nah.

2898
03:12:22,480 --> 03:12:22,920
Chess.

2899
03:12:23,620 --> 03:12:24,460
Okay, here we go.

2900
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:26,820
Oh, that's literally it!

2901
03:12:31,900 --> 03:12:33,380
Now I don't feel like we missed some.

2902
03:12:33,400 --> 03:12:47,600

03:13:11,240 --> 03:13:12,820

2905
03:13:23,820 --> 03:13:27,980
Oh, oh, he's beefy.

2906
03:13:28,240 --> 03:13:29,400
Oh, he's beefy.

2907
03:13:29,660 --> 03:13:30,400
Oh, he's beefy.

2908
03:13:30,660 --> 03:13:32,640
Oh, he's really beefy.

2909
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:35,400
I think we might just die.

2910
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:37,820
I got him.

2911
03:13:37,900 --> 03:13:38,400
I got him.

2912
03:13:38,520 --> 03:13:39,100
I got him.

2913
03:13:42,360 --> 03:13:44,060
Searching the body, you find a book.

2914
03:13:44,900 --> 03:13:46,860
It really is Doom Salons.

2915
03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:52,940
Who is this?

2916
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:56,960
Did I- I got the book?

2917
03:13:59,940 --> 03:14:01,760
Wait, that was Kane!

2918
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:07,180
Ah, Mr. Kane's sole material possession since the death of his brother.

2919
03:14:08,100 --> 03:14:08,520
Oh!

2920
03:14:09,560 --> 03:14:11,500
I did it!

2921
03:14:12,980 --> 03:14:15,580
Something else was...

2922
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:22,040
Wait, what did they say about Kane?

2923
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:24,580
The... the, uh...

2924
03:14:27,380 --> 03:14:31,000
Anyone else sad that the fight was better animated than what I...

2925
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:34,360
Yeah, it's something about music.

2926
03:14:35,420 --> 03:14:35,700
Okay.

2927
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:39,180
Who needs music?

2928
03:14:47,710 --> 03:14:48,150
Um...

2929
03:14:48,150 --> 03:14:48,830
Okay.

2930
03:14:53,850 --> 03:14:55,090
Um, can I go this way?

2931
03:14:55,190 --> 03:14:55,370
No.

2932
03:14:56,030 --> 03:14:58,730
Alright, well we got the book for the librarian, I guess.

2933
03:15:00,510 --> 03:15:00,950
Um...

2934
03:15:01,150 --> 03:15:03,150
Let's go back to...

2935
03:15:05,110 --> 03:15:05,420
Uh...

2936
03:15:05,730 --> 03:15:06,810
Not the janitor.

2937
03:15:08,250 --> 03:15:09,270
No, not the janitor.

2938
03:15:11,750 --> 03:15:13,630
This door, is this the chest door?

2939
03:15:16,330 --> 03:15:18,130
This is the wrong key.

2940
03:15:38,060 --> 03:15:38,680
Um...

2941
03:15:38,680 --> 03:15:40,000
Puzzler for nerds!

2942
03:15:40,040 --> 03:15:41,400
Real men swing their sides!

2943
03:15:41,660 --> 03:15:42,000
Yeah!

2944
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:44,800
Uh...

2945
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:53,960
Do we have another option?

2946
03:15:58,300 --> 03:15:59,860
I like this room.

2947
03:16:03,970 --> 03:16:05,790
I don't think I can get to him, though.

2948
03:16:06,950 --> 03:16:08,790
I think I tried before, and I couldn't.

2949
03:16:10,110 --> 03:16:12,310
So let's just go back to the librarian, I guess.

2950
03:16:18,650 --> 03:16:22,010
I think I'm doing things a little out of order from what the guide is saying.

2951
03:16:23,410 --> 03:16:23,810
Oh, wait.

2952
03:16:24,230 --> 03:16:24,670
Was it here?

2953
03:16:25,210 --> 03:16:26,090
Wait, where am I?

2954
03:16:26,470 --> 03:16:27,090
I'm lost.

2955
03:16:30,010 --> 03:16:30,570
Oh, no.

2956
03:16:30,670 --> 03:16:31,770
Okay, I'm not lost.

2957
03:16:32,150 --> 03:16:32,890
It's right here.

2958
03:16:36,820 --> 03:16:37,260
I have...

2959
03:16:37,260 --> 03:16:38,860
This book was inside him.

2960
03:16:41,100 --> 03:16:43,000
Ah, you've returned the book I see.

2961
03:16:43,320 --> 03:16:43,400
Yep.

2962
03:16:43,440 --> 03:16:44,480
Thank you, young man.

2963
03:16:44,620 --> 03:16:44,680
Yep.

2964
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:48,400
Feel free to look around the library for anything that interests you.

2965
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:48,820
Oh.

2966
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:50,860
You told me you'd help me get to the third floor.

2967
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:51,220
Yeah.

2968
03:16:52,140 --> 03:16:53,260
Ah, yes.

2969
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:58,880
You'll need a special key, which is in the keeping of our resident chess master.

2970
03:16:59,180 --> 03:17:00,000
Oh, I got it!

2971
03:17:00,260 --> 03:17:01,400
Here is your clue.

2972
03:17:02,320 --> 03:17:10,900
Along with the positions of his pieces, the chess master holds the key to the third level, always in his thoughts.

2973
03:17:11,340 --> 03:17:12,140
That's the clue?

2974
03:17:12,740 --> 03:17:13,920
Oops, a sequence broke.

2975
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:17,800
I'll write it down for you so that you won't forget.

2976
03:17:18,760 --> 03:17:22,300
If you don't find this key, I'm afraid you'll never make it any further.

2977
03:17:22,300 --> 03:17:23,440
Yeah, but where do I use it?

2978
03:17:23,480 --> 03:17:24,000
Good luck.

2979
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:24,680

Okay, well, always in his thoughts.

2992
03:17:52,140 --> 03:17:53,700

There's a cheat if you want to get ammo.

Is there?

3008
03:20:16,100 --> 03:20:16,560

3020
03:20:58,690 --> 03:21:00,690
The guide says you need three.

3021
03:21:04,710 --> 03:21:05,670

3022
03:21:06,590 --> 03:21:07,370

What a lovely little dining hall.

3042
03:22:46,050 --> 03:22:46,770
The door is locked.

3043
03:22:46,950 --> 03:22:48,710

Okay, I'm guessing the cutie.

3059

Okay.

3071
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:24,420
Eat the brain.

3072
03:24:25,340 --> 03:24:26,280
It won't let me in.

3073
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:27,380
The game hates me.

3074
03:24:28,440 --> 03:24:33,580
Brown stands on the outside of this jack-in-the-box suggests you don't want what's packed inside to come spread out.

3075
03:24:34,280 --> 03:24:34,740
Are you sure?

3076
03:24:35,040 --> 03:24:35,680

03:24:51,340 --> 03:24:53,440
The thing to open the doors.

3081
03:24:53,740 --> 03:24:54,460
The double doors.

3112
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:04,700
Wait, what?

3113
03:27:05,460 --> 03:27:07,220

1000 IQ.

3159
03:30:22,500 --> 03:30:22,940
That's mean.

3160
03:30:23,820 --> 03:30:24,760
We're solving that.

3161
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:26,360
Totally on purpose.

3162
03:30:29,850 --> 03:30:35,610
Sam in the washers, blood red water swirls, what is the lodge so weird?

3163

What else we got?

3166
03:30:56,310 --> 03:30:58,890
Oh, these look like Stephanie's clothes!

3167
03:30:59,790 --> 03:31:01,370
Wait, is Stephanie not dead?

3168
03:31:02,970 --> 03:31:03,990

3170
03:31:07,290 --> 03:31:08,010

03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:08,430
Wait.

3172
03:31:08,790 --> 03:31:09,690

3173
03:31:09,970 --> 03:31:10,310

3183
03:31:26,090 --> 03:31:26,450
Wrench.

03:31:27,090 --> 03:31:27,830
Pick up the wrench?

3185
03:31:28,370 --> 03:31:29,070

3186
03:31:30,030 --> 03:31:30,950

Am I blind?

3192
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:24,200
Hard to see?

3193
03:32:33,560 --> 03:32:34,460
Oh, is it here?

3194
03:32:34,680 --> 03:32:34,860
Wait.

3195
03:32:37,860 --> 03:32:38,840
I can't see it.

3196
03:32:38,880 --> 03:32:39,640
I don't know where it is.

3197
03:32:39,740 --> 03:32:41,340
Where the steam is coming out.

3198
03:32:43,940 --> 03:32:44,420
Here.

3199
03:32:45,360 --> 03:32:45,560
Wait.

3200
03:32:45,980 --> 03:32:46,880
Broken pipe!

3201
03:32:48,100 --> 03:32:49,820
This pipe has a rusted hole.

3202
03:32:50,800 --> 03:32:52,400
How do I fix it?

3203
03:32:54,880 --> 03:32:55,360
On...

3204
03:32:58,650 --> 03:33:00,810
Okay, that didn't fix it.

3205
03:33:02,670 --> 03:33:03,150
Um...

3206
03:33:03,150 --> 03:33:03,730
Wait, what?

3207
03:33:07,150 --> 03:33:11,110
Well, apparently you need to use the wrench on the broken pipe.

3208
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:15,840
Damn it.

3209
03:33:16,060 --> 03:33:17,620
Wait, where's the broken pipe?

3210
03:33:18,280 --> 03:33:18,880
Where'd it go?

3211
03:33:19,220 --> 03:33:19,820
Okay, there it is.

3212
03:33:21,180 --> 03:33:22,960
Oh, and then I put in the new one?

3213
03:33:28,360 --> 03:33:29,620
Pipe is too short.

3214
03:33:30,660 --> 03:33:39,960

Stephanie's clothes.

3218
03:34:08,880 --> 03:34:09,180
Oh, whoops.

3219
03:34:09,560 --> 03:34:11,040
I didn't mean to click on me.

3220
03:34:11,120 --> 03:34:12,660
Oh, get me out of there.

3221
03:34:13,460 --> 03:34:15,420
Okay, so we go, go, go, go.

3222
03:34:17,500 --> 03:34:19,260
We grab the pipe.

3223
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:20,560
Grab it.

3224
03:34:20,740 --> 03:34:21,180
Take it.

3225
03:34:21,480 --> 03:34:22,400
Put it in my pocket.

3226
03:34:22,840 --> 03:34:23,480
Grab the wrench.

3227
03:34:23,980 --> 03:34:24,660
Put it in my pocket.

3228
03:34:25,300 --> 03:34:26,420
We'll do the wrench now.

3229
03:34:27,040 --> 03:34:27,760
Wrench on.

3230
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:29,280
Oh, that's the chainsaw.

3231
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:33,720
Turn it off.

3232
03:34:36,140 --> 03:34:36,520
What did I use?

3233
03:34:36,560 --> 03:34:37,420
Oh, wrench on.

3234
03:34:40,520 --> 03:34:41,020
The...

3235
03:34:41,020 --> 03:34:42,120
Oh, it's so hard to see.

3236
03:34:42,700 --> 03:34:43,200
Oh, my gosh.

3237
03:34:43,400 --> 03:34:43,780
Where is it?

3238
03:34:43,960 --> 03:34:44,680
Oh, broken pipe.

3239
03:34:45,200 --> 03:34:45,680
Right there.

3240
03:34:46,600 --> 03:34:46,900
Okay.

3241
03:34:47,780 --> 03:34:47,980
Oops.

3242
03:34:48,560 --> 03:34:49,320
And then we run.

3243
03:34:50,980 --> 03:34:51,480
Okay.

3244
03:34:54,140 --> 03:34:55,580
Smarty pants over here.

3245
03:34:56,340 --> 03:34:56,840
Grab it.

3246
03:34:57,560 --> 03:34:58,300
Combine it.

3247
03:34:59,420 --> 03:34:59,920
Okay.

3248
03:35:00,740 --> 03:35:03,340
I'm not quite sure how this works, but sure.

3249
03:35:04,620 --> 03:35:05,660
And then we go back.

3250
03:35:09,140 --> 03:35:09,360
Uh.

3251
03:35:12,200 --> 03:35:12,680
Okay.

3252
03:35:14,340 --> 03:35:14,660
Um.

3253
03:35:15,280 --> 03:35:16,220
Well, that didn't work.

3254
03:35:16,420 --> 03:35:16,700
Okay.

3255
03:35:18,460 --> 03:35:19,500
Well, that didn't work.

3256
03:35:19,820 --> 03:35:20,840
Uh, bypass back.

3257
03:35:20,840 --> 03:35:21,520
Well, that didn't work.

3258
03:35:21,780 --> 03:35:21,960
Eh?

3259
03:35:22,180 --> 03:35:22,580
Oh, wait.

3260
03:35:22,620 --> 03:35:23,580
Where do I put this now?

3261
03:35:39,380 --> 03:35:39,860
Okay.

3262
03:35:39,860 --> 03:35:40,020
Okay.

3263
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:41,260
Oof.

3264
03:35:42,640 --> 03:35:43,160
A key.

3265
03:35:43,560 --> 03:35:44,300
Boiler room key.

3266
03:35:45,820 --> 03:35:47,400
I don't want to do that again.

3267
03:35:48,100 --> 03:35:49,660
So we're going to save the game.

3268
03:35:52,640 --> 03:35:53,200
Sheeshaw.

3269
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:53,820
Okay.

3270
03:35:55,960 --> 03:35:57,540
1000 IQ indeed.

3271
03:35:58,520 --> 03:35:59,560
Yes indeedy.

3272
03:36:03,420 --> 03:36:04,360
Boiler room key?

3273
03:36:04,660 --> 03:36:05,100
This one.

3274
03:36:06,640 --> 03:36:07,620
Well that didn't work.

3275
03:36:07,780 --> 03:36:07,960
Oh.

3276
03:36:08,300 --> 03:36:08,780
It didn't?

3277
03:36:10,580 --> 03:36:11,680
The door's...

3278
03:36:13,260 --> 03:36:14,420
Did I...

3279
03:36:20,890 --> 03:36:22,150
Oh, there we go.

3280
03:36:22,290 --> 03:36:22,630
Again.

3281
03:36:24,870 --> 03:36:27,850
Okay, I'm gonna change my weapon.

3282
03:36:28,410 --> 03:36:30,670
I also wanted to say... Maybe the chainsaw.

3283
03:36:30,950 --> 03:36:32,990
Oh, it also... Okay.

3284
03:36:34,490 --> 03:36:35,070
Interesting.

3285
03:36:45,850 --> 03:36:47,550
I'm gonna try the nail gun.

3286
03:36:54,920 --> 03:36:56,340
This guy is tough?

3287
03:36:56,460 --> 03:36:57,280
No way, really?

3288
03:37:00,500 --> 03:37:01,020
Okay.

3289
03:37:01,280 --> 03:37:01,800
Okay.

3290
03:37:03,120 --> 03:37:04,680
Let's try the nail gun.

3291
03:37:08,290 --> 03:37:09,490
Chainsaw too tiny.

3292
03:37:10,330 --> 03:37:10,730
Oh, whoops.

3293
03:37:10,890 --> 03:37:11,050
I forgot.

3294
03:37:11,290 --> 03:37:13,890
I needed to unlock it.

3295
03:37:15,870 --> 03:37:17,690
Oh, I pressed...

3296
03:37:17,690 --> 03:37:19,650
I pressed right click instead of left click.

3297
03:37:21,310 --> 03:37:21,770
Oh, okay.

3298
03:37:23,670 --> 03:37:23,930
Oh!

3299
03:37:26,530 --> 03:37:27,050
Oh!

3300
03:37:27,530 --> 03:37:27,550
Oh!

3301
03:37:27,550 --> 03:37:27,910

3302
03:37:31,010 --> 03:37:33,010
Tough my booty.

3303
03:37:34,770 --> 03:37:36,210
We got him good.

3304
03:37:37,390 --> 03:37:38,530
We got him good.

3305
03:37:39,590 --> 03:37:43,470
The turbines scream in a high-pitched wine.

3306
03:37:44,590 --> 03:37:45,730
Where the heck are we?

3307
03:37:49,580 --> 03:37:50,380
Whoa.

3308
03:37:54,380 --> 03:37:57,240
These are Zumbini sound effects.

3309
03:37:57,640 --> 03:37:58,700
I'm examining the lava.

3310
03:37:58,880 --> 03:38:22,400

3312
03:39:02,170 --> 03:39:06,110
I think we have to go back out and uh...

3313
03:39:07,090 --> 03:39:07,650
Oh man.

3314
03:39:07,990 --> 03:39:08,830

3315
03:39:09,190 --> 03:39:09,710
What do you mean?

3316
03:39:10,150 --> 03:39:11,110
Oh man!

3317
03:39:16,360 --> 03:39:18,040
I'm gone.

3318
03:39:29,970 --> 03:39:31,650
No ice.

3319
03:39:34,290 --> 03:39:35,170
Alright, save.

3320
03:39:38,130 --> 03:40:04,510

This key?

3324
03:40:47,530 --> 03:40:48,070
Will this work?

3325
03:40:49,250 --> 03:40:50,170
I don't.

3326
03:40:51,870 --> 03:40:53,870
This is how I'm feeling right now.

3327
03:40:57,550 --> 03:41:00,470
Oh my god, I only grabbed one plank.

3328
03:41:02,270 --> 03:41:04,510
How far back do I have to load?

3329
03:41:06,130 --> 03:41:07,550
Clowning around in?

3330
03:41:14,960 --> 03:41:15,600

3332
03:41:31,190 --> 03:41:34,790
Oh my gosh, I have to do that stinking puzzle all over again.

3333
03:41:35,210 --> 03:41:35,850
Oh my gosh.

3334
03:41:40,390 --> 03:41:40,970
But you know what?

3335
03:41:40,970 --> 03:41:42,830
This time, I didn't get hurt.

3336
03:41:45,710 --> 03:41:46,970
Complementary coffin nails.

3337
03:41:47,170 --> 03:41:48,510
Oh, it didn't give me more.

3338
03:41:48,690 --> 03:41:49,270
Well, you know what?

3339
03:41:49,370 --> 03:41:50,010
That's fine.

3340
03:41:58,410 --> 03:41:59,110
There's three.

3341
03:41:59,350 --> 03:41:59,990
Okay, there's three.

3342
03:42:00,130 --> 03:42:00,630
Thank you.

3343
03:42:01,170 --> 03:42:03,090
We gotta go find one more then.

3344
03:42:04,370 --> 03:42:06,130
Naria, thank you so much for the redirect.

3345
03:42:06,670 --> 03:42:07,310
Thank you.

3346
03:42:07,590 --> 03:42:08,310
Welcome, welcome.

3347
03:42:10,830 --> 03:42:11,890
Where's the third one at?

3348
03:42:12,030 --> 03:42:12,550
Oh, this one.

3349
03:42:13,610 --> 03:42:14,670
Thank you, guys.

3350
03:42:15,210 --> 03:42:15,730
I'll bring it back.

3351
03:42:15,770 --> 03:42:16,190
Thank you.

3352
03:42:16,210 --> 03:42:17,310
I can't see I have to do the IQ.

3353
03:42:18,490 --> 03:42:19,630
Thank you, guys.

3354
03:42:23,150 --> 03:42:23,690
Oh, wait.

3355
03:42:25,650 --> 03:42:26,510
I figured it out.

3356
03:42:28,250 --> 03:42:33,210
There I go, thank you for the fine gift to take up a yon-yon, thank you.

3357
03:42:33,910 --> 03:42:36,070
Alright, hold on, let's save real quick.

3358
03:42:38,710 --> 03:42:40,230
Maybe I shouldn't have used.

3359
03:42:41,410 --> 03:42:45,710
We'll just save over 1000 IQ since it's already soft locked.

3360
03:42:46,650 --> 03:42:49,790
Maybe I shouldn't have used the nail gun on.

3361
03:42:50,390 --> 03:42:51,570
But it's fine, it's fine, whatever.

3362
03:42:53,250 --> 03:42:55,670
I'm gonna put it away though in case I accidentally use it again.

3363
03:42:56,330 --> 03:42:56,590
Okay.

3364
03:42:58,330 --> 03:42:59,890
No, well thank you.

3365
03:43:00,750 --> 03:43:01,950
Poffing nails or cigarettes.

3366
03:43:02,950 --> 03:43:02,990
Oh!

3367
03:43:04,610 --> 03:43:07,810
Okay, before I go...

3368
03:43:08,770 --> 03:43:11,630
Actually, I'm gonna leave this room because the sound is annoying.

3369
03:43:12,470 --> 03:43:14,230
Before I...

3370
03:43:14,230 --> 03:43:17,650
Go in there, I'm gonna get something to drink real quick.

3371
03:43:17,730 --> 03:43:19,530
I will be right back.

3372
03:45:22,070 --> 03:45:23,350
You guys, it's so funny.

3373
03:45:23,790 --> 03:45:25,690
I've been trying to sneeze all stream.

3374
03:45:26,190 --> 03:45:28,210
My nose has been so icky.

3375
03:45:28,990 --> 03:45:32,490
As soon as I walk out the door, two sneezes.

3376
03:45:34,570 --> 03:45:35,700
Two of them.

3377
03:45:38,330 --> 03:45:38,790
Ouch, ouch.

3378
03:45:41,330 --> 03:45:41,850
Alrighty.

3379
03:45:45,470 --> 03:45:47,170
I also got a little snack.

3380
03:45:49,430 --> 03:45:51,070
It's cheese and nuts.

3381
03:45:54,510 --> 03:45:55,450
Yummy.

3382
03:46:04,200 --> 03:46:06,760
Alright, let's go do this one really annoying puzzle.

3383
03:46:08,320 --> 03:46:08,800
Puzzoon tight.

3384
03:46:10,140 --> 03:46:10,580
Nankashim.

3385
03:46:14,440 --> 03:46:14,700
Okay.

3386
03:46:15,240 --> 03:46:15,760
Run, run!

3387
03:46:21,740 --> 03:46:23,140
I got the third plank, no?

3388
03:46:25,880 --> 03:46:26,860
I'll double check.

3389
03:46:27,860 --> 03:46:28,920
Yeah, I got three planks.

3390
03:46:29,200 --> 03:46:29,900
We're good, we're good.

3391
03:46:31,500 --> 03:46:32,160
Pick up!

3392
03:46:32,460 --> 03:46:33,080
Pick up!

3393
03:46:35,440 --> 03:46:37,660
I guess I don't need to put it in my inventory.

3394
03:46:38,080 --> 03:46:38,300
Whatever.

3395
03:46:38,500 --> 03:46:39,140
Whatever, it's fine.

3396
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:41,540
Oh wait, uh...

3397
03:46:42,680 --> 03:46:43,660
Turn the bell!

3398
03:46:49,870 --> 03:46:50,170
On the pipe!

3399
03:46:50,890 --> 03:46:51,810
Wait, where do I put it?

3400
03:46:52,470 --> 03:46:53,590
There we go.

3401
03:46:53,830 --> 03:46:53,830
Okay.

3402
03:46:54,330 --> 03:46:55,170
Go grab the other pipes.

3403
03:47:00,410 --> 03:47:00,710
Grab it!

3404
03:47:00,770 --> 03:47:01,330
Grab it!

3405
03:47:01,650 --> 03:47:02,370
Oh my gosh.

3406
03:47:02,550 --> 03:47:04,090
I hate him so much sometimes.

3407
03:47:08,050 --> 03:47:08,530
Combine!

3408
03:47:10,330 --> 03:47:10,810
Combine!

3409
03:47:11,110 --> 03:47:11,250
Okay.

3410
03:47:18,020 --> 03:47:18,300
Ew!

3411
03:47:18,980 --> 03:47:19,460
Ew!

3412
03:47:26,210 --> 03:47:26,690
Yippee!

3413
03:47:26,990 --> 03:47:27,170
Okay.

3414
03:47:28,950 --> 03:47:31,130
We've avoided the soft lock.

3415
03:47:40,250 --> 03:47:41,210
Equip nail gun.

3416
03:47:43,030 --> 03:47:43,870
Save game.

3417
03:47:51,580 --> 03:47:53,400
Oh, I should have saved it after I unlocked it, but whatever.

3418
03:47:54,960 --> 03:47:55,440
Okay.

3419
03:47:56,300 --> 03:47:57,500
Why do you say that?

3420
03:47:58,160 --> 03:47:59,900
It's literally what you're supposed to do.

3421
03:48:09,080 --> 03:48:11,280
Oh, I have just two left.

3422
03:48:13,560 --> 03:48:14,120
Okay.

3423
03:48:15,300 --> 03:48:17,920
like he's being so smart with me

3424
03:48:23,360 --> 03:48:25,780
we've managed to avoid soft locking

3425
03:48:28,880 --> 03:48:40,610
okay why would you walk into the water

3426
03:48:47,750 --> 03:48:49,090
1000 IQ

3427
03:48:52,330 --> 03:48:56,350
what he's gonna say it again oh man Damn it.

3428
03:48:56,510 --> 03:48:57,430
Well that didn't work.

3429
03:48:57,970 --> 03:48:58,290
Damn it.

3430
03:48:58,550 --> 03:48:58,950
Damn it.

3431
03:48:59,050 --> 03:48:59,190
Damn it.

3432
03:48:59,190 --> 03:49:02,970
Well that didn't work.

3433
03:49:02,970 --> 03:49:07,490
I don't understand why it doesn't work.

3434
03:49:15,570 --> 03:49:17,050
Okay now we're gonna save.

3435
03:49:24,070 --> 03:49:28,470
Since we're already committed to this save run, we'll just, you know.

3436
03:49:33,590 --> 03:49:34,150
Okay.

3437
03:49:36,410 --> 03:49:39,630
Obviously, I know that this is, like, going to be a timed thing.

3438
03:49:43,150 --> 03:49:43,710
So...

3439
03:49:48,160 --> 03:49:49,700
Okay, and next one.

3440
03:49:52,200 --> 03:49:52,500
Run!

3441
03:49:53,020 --> 03:49:55,380
I don't know how this works, but sure.

3442
03:49:59,580 --> 03:49:59,940
Yeah!

3443
03:50:00,860 --> 03:50:02,020
Finally another brood!

3444
03:50:09,330 --> 03:50:09,930
Wait, what?

3445
03:50:10,430 --> 03:50:11,710
What was the third one?

3446
03:50:11,990 --> 03:50:13,090
What was the third plank?

3447
03:50:18,540 --> 03:50:19,020
What?

3448
03:50:27,780 --> 03:50:28,200
Oh, gosh.

3449
03:50:29,860 --> 03:50:30,240
Uh.

3450
03:50:31,400 --> 03:50:31,880
Uh.

3451
03:50:33,600 --> 03:50:34,580
Oh, I know.

3452
03:50:34,640 --> 03:50:35,440
I know what to do.

3453
03:50:35,620 --> 03:50:36,220
I know what to do here.

3454
03:50:37,180 --> 03:50:37,640
I can tell.

3455
03:50:38,360 --> 03:50:38,640
Aha!

3456
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:39,800
I know what to do.

3457
03:50:40,720 --> 03:50:41,480
I know what to do.

3458
03:50:45,280 --> 03:50:47,820
The remains of a less fortunate initiate.

3459
03:50:49,540 --> 03:50:50,500
Limestone stalagmite.

3460
03:50:50,780 --> 03:50:51,460
Can I leave now?

3461
03:50:52,720 --> 03:50:54,260
Ha ha ha ha ha.

3462
03:50:54,260 --> 03:50:54,880
Ha ha ha!

3463
03:50:59,410 --> 03:51:01,110
Why'd you pick up those two flags?

3464
03:51:01,130 --> 03:51:01,650
Ragbos.

3465
03:51:06,390 --> 03:51:08,350
For this reason and this reason alone.

3466
03:51:12,840 --> 03:51:13,180
Damn.

3467
03:51:15,300 --> 03:51:15,940
I really...

3468
03:51:15,940 --> 03:51:16,900
That was like...

3469
03:51:16,900 --> 03:51:18,680
I think I could put that on my resume.

3470
03:51:20,060 --> 03:51:20,140
Thanks.

3471
03:51:20,620 --> 03:51:22,140
Thanks quickly on her feet.

3472
03:51:25,380 --> 03:51:26,120
Oh, hello.

3473
03:51:34,760 --> 03:51:35,400
Whoa.

3474
03:51:35,980 --> 03:51:37,260
I thought I was gonna die.

3475
03:51:38,140 --> 03:51:39,360
I look like I'm dying.

3476
03:51:40,980 --> 03:51:42,030
Can carry two flagpoles.

3477
03:51:45,780 --> 03:51:46,240
Okay.

3478
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:49,020
Hmm.

3479
03:51:51,320 --> 03:51:51,520
Hmm.

3480
03:51:53,240 --> 03:51:54,000
We go up.

3481
03:51:54,340 --> 03:51:58,000
I'm scared to save because I took a lot of damage, but I will save a new save.

3482
03:52:03,270 --> 03:52:05,350
Knocking on death's door.

3483
03:52:05,570 --> 03:52:05,690
Oop.

3484
03:52:10,250 --> 03:52:11,110
Alright, here we go.

3485
03:52:11,950 --> 03:52:13,670
Up to the fourth floor!

3486
03:52:14,590 --> 03:52:15,390
Level three, just kidding.

3487
03:52:17,430 --> 03:52:18,710
I'm in third floor!

3488
03:52:19,290 --> 03:52:20,130
Can't count!

3489
03:52:21,110 --> 03:52:23,650
You hear a familiar scream quickly, you climb up to investigate.

3490
03:52:24,850 --> 03:52:29,450
When you say you want us to have cool stuff to say about you, that now top of the list!

3491
03:52:31,250 --> 03:52:32,730
Yeah, my Yoshi.

3492
03:52:34,930 --> 03:52:36,470
She can't count to three.

3493
03:52:42,220 --> 03:52:42,740
Damn!

3494
03:52:43,220 --> 03:52:43,720
Let's go.

3495
03:52:48,650 --> 03:52:50,850
I could use a snack.

3496
03:52:53,270 --> 03:52:55,590
The door is locked from the other side.

3497
03:52:56,610 --> 03:52:58,350
Oh my gosh, we're at the last level, you guys.

3498
03:52:58,470 --> 03:52:59,670
We're so close to the game.

3499
03:53:03,950 --> 03:53:04,810
Wait, can I have one of those?

3500
03:53:04,990 --> 03:53:06,530
This is the temple of the mystery of abstinence.

3501
03:53:07,010 --> 03:53:08,890
Do not eat of the food or you will be punished.

3502
03:53:09,270 --> 03:53:11,810
All within are hereby bound to a vow of abstinence.

3503
03:53:12,290 --> 03:53:13,410
I thought that was...

3504
03:53:14,370 --> 03:53:15,990
I thought that was not with food.

3505
03:53:19,230 --> 03:53:20,390
Operate the hamburger.

3506
03:53:20,910 --> 03:53:22,450
Wait, he's eating it, though!

3507
03:53:24,790 --> 03:53:25,590
What if I do it?

3508
03:53:25,890 --> 03:53:26,270
Oh, shoot.

3509
03:53:27,310 --> 03:53:28,030
Oh, wait.

3510
03:53:39,740 --> 03:53:41,260
Did I get my health back?

3511
03:53:41,580 --> 03:53:41,720
Mm-hmm.

3512
03:53:43,580 --> 03:53:44,520
I think I'm going to reload.

3513
03:53:47,700 --> 03:53:48,060
Ugh.

3514
03:53:52,640 --> 03:53:54,760
Um, I don't want to lose on my goal this way.

3515
03:53:55,820 --> 03:53:56,180
Um...

3516
03:54:15,600 --> 03:54:17,320
Pretentious and preachy.

3517
03:54:17,540 --> 03:54:18,920
This is the...

3518
03:54:18,920 --> 03:54:19,800
Examine door.

3519
03:54:21,240 --> 03:54:22,080
What about this one?

3520
03:54:22,160 --> 03:54:22,740
It's locked.

3521
03:54:23,700 --> 03:54:24,520
There's a plant.

3522
03:54:26,320 --> 03:54:27,560
This is the temple of the...

3523
03:54:27,560 --> 03:54:28,840
What am I supposed to do then?

3524
03:54:28,920 --> 03:54:29,620
Just wait here?

3525
03:54:31,780 --> 03:54:33,660
Can I kill him with the chainsaw?

3526
03:54:36,980 --> 03:54:38,020
I want...

3527
03:54:38,020 --> 03:54:39,000
The burger though.

3528
03:54:40,000 --> 03:54:40,560
So unfair.

3529
03:54:42,100 --> 03:54:43,120
Operate hamburger.

3530
03:54:48,100 --> 03:54:50,770
I'll take one take one

3531
03:54:55,300 --> 03:55:13,320
The central mystery is thus those who advocate abstinence are those who possess the most It is to their advantage that you obey not to yours The meek shall inherit the earth when the strong are finished with it The advance initiate and remember what you have learned Oh

3532
03:55:18,320 --> 03:55:20,600
You miss every shot you can't don't take,

3533
03:55:24,820 --> 03:55:24,820
buddy.

3534
03:55:26,520 --> 03:55:29,840
Um, literal stormtrooper aim.

3535
03:55:36,480 --> 03:55:37,080
Why do you...

3536
03:55:37,080 --> 03:55:40,700
Why do you look at me like that?

3537
03:55:40,860 --> 03:55:41,580
Wait a second!

3538
03:55:55,670 --> 03:55:56,370
Okay, hold on.

3539
03:55:56,450 --> 03:55:57,710
I'm gonna save here.

3540
03:56:04,370 --> 03:56:05,750
Will I ever get out of here?

3541
03:56:06,110 --> 03:56:08,190
Maybe I do just have to nail gun through it.

3542
03:56:08,230 --> 03:56:16,390
but ah ah whatever oh okay give me that this is the temple of the

Okay.

3547
03:57:24,800 --> 03:57:26,260
Oh, I forgot the ammo.

3548
03:57:28,320 --> 03:57:29,620
Yeah, but he still killed me.

3549
03:57:31,840 --> 03:57:32,580
Okay, hold on.

3550
03:57:33,240 --> 03:57:34,020
Oh, my God.

3551
03:57:35,180 --> 03:57:36,360
We'll take this.

3552
03:57:41,090 --> 03:57:41,990
Oh, gosh.

3553
03:57:42,270 --> 03:57:43,250
I think I'm in trouble, guys.

3554
03:57:47,930 --> 03:57:48,910
Shut up.

3555
03:57:48,950 --> 03:57:49,610
I don't care.

3556
03:57:56,490 --> 03:57:58,050
Oh my god.

3557
03:57:59,170 --> 03:58:00,770
How many times do I have to see this?

3558
03:58:02,850 --> 03:58:04,270
Why am I not shooting?

3559
03:58:05,510 --> 03:58:05,790
What?

3560
03:58:06,170 --> 03:58:08,070
I was clicking this time for me, though.

3561
03:58:09,290 --> 03:58:09,770
Oh!

3562
03:58:11,210 --> 03:58:13,070
Why was I not shooting?

3563
03:58:16,990 --> 03:58:19,450
I clicked so many times.

3564
03:58:26,390 --> 03:58:27,530
Out of range.

3565
03:58:30,810 --> 03:58:32,590
No, I clicked when it was green.

3566
03:58:33,190 --> 03:58:35,150
Also, you can just click and you should be able to shoot.

3567
03:58:37,810 --> 03:58:40,470
You don't have to like actually be on them.

3568
03:58:41,870 --> 03:58:44,230
You lost on purpose to see that guy's face again.

3569
03:58:47,150 --> 03:58:48,070
I'm sick of it!

3570
03:58:48,150 --> 03:58:49,390
I don't care about your message!

3571
03:58:49,890 --> 03:58:50,670
Oh, oh, oops.

3572
03:58:53,250 --> 03:58:54,010
I have

3573
03:58:58,160 --> 03:59:00,540
to reload the gun.

3574
03:59:00,540 --> 03:59:26,060
I don't know I don't think so it's getting worse here I'll check though you know what I made it when I only use this guy so let's just do that this is the temp oh my god I'm such an idiot stop shooting up

3575
03:59:48,940 --> 03:59:52,240
you know what fine I'm not even gonna touch Watch it.

3576
03:59:52,720 --> 03:59:53,100
I don't care.

3577
03:59:53,960 --> 03:59:54,740
Eat your stupid burgers.

3578
03:59:54,900 --> 03:59:55,400
I don't care.

3579
03:59:57,420 --> 04:00:01,100
This is the...

3580
04:00:16,790 --> 04:00:17,690
I'm clicking.

3581
04:00:18,030 --> 04:00:19,330
I'm clicking right now, you guys.

3582
04:00:19,550 --> 04:00:19,890
I'm clicking.

3583
04:00:20,270 --> 04:00:20,650
I'm clicking.

3584
04:00:21,090 --> 04:00:21,590
Oh, finally.

3585
04:00:21,930 --> 04:00:22,570
I'm clicking.

3586
04:00:23,210 --> 04:00:23,770
I'm clicking.

3587
04:00:25,350 --> 04:00:26,370
What the hell?

3588
04:00:26,390 --> 04:00:27,070
The system of victory is thus.

3589
04:00:27,650 --> 04:00:30,530
Those who advocate abstinence are those who possess the most.

3590
04:00:31,230 --> 04:00:33,070
It is to their advantage that you obey.

3591
04:00:33,230 --> 04:00:33,710
Ah!

3592
04:00:36,130 --> 04:00:37,510
Oh, you can't, though.

3593
04:00:37,670 --> 04:00:38,290
I can't with this.

3594
04:00:40,170 --> 04:00:40,570
Oh,

3595
04:00:45,720 --> 04:00:46,660
no, I didn't mean to do that.

3596
04:00:46,820 --> 04:00:47,560
I do need help.

3597
04:00:48,480 --> 04:00:50,060
I hate this part!

3598
04:00:50,220 --> 04:00:50,820
Why am I

3599
04:00:54,210 --> 04:00:54,830
gonna...

3600
04:00:54,830 --> 04:00:57,650
Why is the game being so stinky to me?

3601
04:01:09,720 --> 04:01:13,180
Are you sure you didn't forget the controls when you thought you were out of ammo?

3602
04:01:16,180 --> 04:01:17,000
Oh, yeah.

3603
04:01:18,060 --> 04:01:19,460
Oh yeah, Scythe.

3604
04:01:19,860 --> 04:01:21,880
Totally known for having ammo.

3605
04:01:22,740 --> 04:01:23,080
Yeah.

3606
04:01:23,800 --> 04:01:29,740
The most famous weapon of choice that is known for having ammo.

3607
04:01:30,160 --> 04:01:31,000
The Scythe.

3608
04:01:31,800 --> 04:01:32,560
Yeah, yeah.

3609
04:01:35,040 --> 04:01:36,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3610
04:01:39,080 --> 04:01:40,720
Wesker from AliExpress.

3611
04:01:40,960 --> 04:01:41,320
Who that?

3612
04:01:42,500 --> 04:01:44,220
Is that a Resident Evil guy?

3613
04:01:48,910 --> 04:01:50,250
Well, if you're Ruby.

3614
04:01:53,230 --> 04:01:56,490
I don't know why the game is being so stinky all of a sudden, though.

3615
04:01:59,370 --> 04:02:03,390
I mean, when it's my fault, I, you know, I say it's my fault, but I don't know why.

3616
04:02:05,930 --> 04:02:06,810
Okay, I'm just going to let the...

3617
04:02:06,810 --> 04:02:08,130
Okay, I'm reading the guide.

3618
04:02:08,230 --> 04:02:11,010
The guide says let the dude eat the burgers and then he kill him.

3619
04:02:11,250 --> 04:02:12,510
But, like, shut up.

3620
04:02:12,630 --> 04:02:13,190
I don't care.

3621
04:02:16,390 --> 04:02:19,410
I'll switch to the nail gun.

3622
04:02:20,490 --> 04:02:22,610
I feel like we did well with the chainsaw.

3623
04:02:23,910 --> 04:02:26,450
Well, let him eat his burgers, and then this guy leaves, apparently.

3624
04:02:33,560 --> 04:02:35,940
Finish your burgers, Mr. Presley.

3625
04:02:36,620 --> 04:02:37,700
You obey well, Initiate.

3626
04:02:38,200 --> 04:02:39,100
Better than your brethren.

3627
04:02:39,860 --> 04:02:41,740
They have eaten and grown stronger for it.

3628
04:02:42,500 --> 04:02:44,880
As promised, I will not punish you for your obedience.

3629
04:02:45,980 --> 04:02:46,880
But they will.

3630
04:02:50,310 --> 04:02:50,890
Oh my god!

3631
04:02:51,090 --> 04:02:51,310
Hello?

3632
04:02:54,070 --> 04:02:56,510
Once again, the game is not...

3633
04:02:56,510 --> 04:02:57,330
I'm...

3634
04:02:57,350 --> 04:03:02,070
trying to play the game and it's not letting me oh

3635
04:03:09,010 --> 04:03:12,270

3637
04:03:30,240 --> 04:03:32,300

3639
04:03:53,670 --> 04:03:56,230
I'm actually getting tilted a little bit.

3640
04:03:57,870 --> 04:03:59,510
I just want to progress.

3641
04:04:07,560 --> 04:04:08,740
I just want to progress.

3642
04:04:09,780 --> 04:04:11,140
I'll try a different weapon.

3643
04:04:11,380 --> 04:04:11,840
I don't know.

3644
04:04:13,600 --> 04:04:15,660
I don't know.

3645
04:04:16,500 --> 04:04:17,220
This is the...

3646
04:04:17,920 --> 04:04:28,570
I don't think restarting the game is going to do anything, you guys.

3647
04:04:29,490 --> 04:04:31,130
Let me just try!

3648
04:04:31,250 --> 04:04:31,510
Yeah!

3649
04:04:35,490 --> 04:04:37,610
You obey well and...

3650
04:04:45,730 --> 04:04:47,130
I'll

3651
04:04:56,280 --> 04:04:57,680
quit.

3652
04:04:58,880 --> 04:04:59,580
I'll redraw.

3653
04:05:11,450 --> 04:05:12,850
Why?

3654
04:05:17,940 --> 04:05:19,960
Oh my god, GOG just said, rate this game.

3655
04:05:22,540 --> 04:05:23,660
You're really...

3656
04:05:23,660 --> 04:05:24,460
You're really...

3657
04:05:30,790 --> 04:05:31,650
Yeah.

3658
04:05:32,250 --> 04:05:33,710
I'll rate it.

3659
04:05:35,770 --> 04:05:37,390
I'll rate it.

3660
04:05:38,610 --> 04:05:39,430
Alright, let's see.

3661
04:05:41,470 --> 04:05:43,950
Maybe something will change.

3662
04:05:44,790 --> 04:05:46,550
Maybe something will change.

3663
04:05:48,770 --> 04:05:49,630
Oh.

3664
04:05:54,470 --> 04:05:55,550
Stop spamming.

3665
04:05:55,650 --> 04:05:57,290
I don't even have a rocket launcher.

3666
04:05:57,790 --> 04:06:01,310
Why would you spam that if I don't have it?

3667
04:06:03,730 --> 04:06:04,130
Why?

3668
04:06:04,530 --> 04:06:05,410
Why would you do that?

3669
04:06:05,490 --> 04:06:07,630
Why would you spam something I don't have?

3670
04:06:09,410 --> 04:06:09,770
Why?

3671
04:06:09,950 --> 04:06:11,010
Why would you do that?

3672
04:06:16,880 --> 04:06:19,160
Do you have the Scythe rocket launcher?

3673
04:06:19,760 --> 04:06:20,220
Oh, maybe.

3674
04:06:23,620 --> 04:06:25,020
To try Ice Monkey?

3675
04:06:26,100 --> 04:06:29,020
Oh my gosh guys, we have to start all the way from the beginning.

3676
04:06:29,540 --> 04:06:30,160
Just kidding.

3677
04:06:31,380 --> 04:06:32,660
Wouldn't it be cool if it did though?

3678
04:06:35,000 --> 04:06:36,220
Oh, oh.

3679
04:06:37,560 --> 04:06:38,140
Control.

3680
04:06:38,660 --> 04:06:40,220
Oh my gosh, I got a control F4.

3681
04:06:40,800 --> 04:06:41,560
There we go.

3682
04:06:41,700 --> 04:06:43,260
Oh, control F4.

3683
04:06:43,780 --> 04:06:44,300
Okay.

3684
04:06:44,560 --> 04:06:46,000
Try moving diagonally.

3685
04:06:48,940 --> 04:06:49,520
Okay.

3686
04:06:50,380 --> 04:06:52,280
Let's try again.

3687
04:06:53,720 --> 04:06:53,960
Whoops.

3688
04:06:55,080 --> 04:06:55,680
Let's try again.

3689
04:06:55,700 --> 04:06:56,200
Let's try.

3690
04:06:57,020 --> 04:06:57,700
Try again.

3691
04:07:09,400 --> 04:07:10,420
I'm clicking.

3692
04:07:10,820 --> 04:07:11,260
I'm clicking.

3693
04:07:11,700 --> 04:07:12,660
It's still not working.

3694
04:07:13,100 --> 04:07:14,920
It's still not working, you guys.

3695
04:07:17,080 --> 04:07:18,520
I was spam clicking.

3696
04:07:19,280 --> 04:07:20,600
I was spam clicking.

3697
04:07:23,210 --> 04:07:26,960
I feel like I'm getting soft locked because the game mechanics are so bad.

3698
04:07:32,400 --> 04:07:35,080
If there is a cheat, like please tell me.

3699
04:07:35,400 --> 04:07:39,280
I don't know what you guys are telling me to use cheats, but I don't know what they are at all.

3700
04:07:44,000 --> 04:07:45,880
The central mystery is thus.

3701
04:07:47,580 --> 04:07:48,020
Okay.

3702
04:08:00,030 --> 04:08:01,850
Wait, can I eat the burger?

3703
04:08:04,370 --> 04:08:05,830
You eat the hamburgers.

3704
04:08:06,150 --> 04:08:07,570
I ate all of them.

3705
04:08:15,140 --> 04:08:17,560
Actually, yeah, we'll just...

3706
04:08:17,560 --> 04:08:18,260
We'll just...

3707
04:08:18,260 --> 04:08:18,760
This one.

3708
04:08:19,020 --> 04:08:19,380
Just save.

3709
04:08:19,660 --> 04:08:19,980
Just...

3710
04:08:19,980 --> 04:08:22,100
I don't want to ever see it again.

3711
04:08:29,970 --> 04:08:34,510
And some mothers complain that their children don't come to see them.

3712
04:08:35,270 --> 04:08:36,330
Mommy, you're so good.

3713
04:08:36,790 --> 04:08:37,630
You're so good.

3714
04:08:38,950 --> 04:08:40,990
Mommy, you're so good.

3715
04:08:41,070 --> 04:08:41,430
You're so good.

3716
04:08:42,990 --> 04:08:44,270
This is the mystery.

3717
04:08:44,590 --> 04:08:45,870
Mommy, you're so good.

3718
04:08:46,970 --> 04:08:47,650
Cannibalism!

3719
04:08:48,050 --> 04:08:48,070
Cannibalism!

3720
04:08:48,990 --> 04:09:19,070
motherhood is fulfilling when in reality it's draining i see what you mean oh you don't know the half of it ew guys from the start children are parasites you're so good you're so good that's what you've got to understand this is why we killed jimmy james yeah you're very wonderful the hamburger was our nightmares.

3721
04:09:25,330 --> 04:09:26,010
Mmm,

3722
04:09:31,570 --> 04:09:32,910
mommy, you're so good.

3723
04:09:34,070 --> 04:09:37,170
Mmm, mommy, you're so good.

3724
04:09:37,470 --> 04:09:38,050
You're so good.

3725
04:09:38,050 --> 04:09:40,370
My children are better at it than most.

3726
04:09:41,890 --> 04:09:44,010
Is that the bliss of motherhood?

3727
04:09:45,050 --> 04:09:46,290
That's the mystery.

3728
04:09:48,570 --> 04:10:17,310
needs more greedy little mouths to feed children suck the life out of society they have to be protected and nurtured everything has to be childproof I'm glad I ate a hamburger for lunch sadly they'll suck the life out of you too mommy you're so good you're so good oh shoot oh my god wait wait wait wait kid

3729
04:10:22,850 --> 04:10:24,150
Come here, come here.

3730
04:10:24,310 --> 04:10:24,450
Oh, wait.

3731
04:10:24,850 --> 04:10:25,170
Oh, shoot.

3732
04:10:25,750 --> 04:10:29,490
Uh, I think I have to use the scythe this time.

3733
04:10:36,210 --> 04:10:36,430
Yeah!

3734
04:10:37,490 --> 04:10:38,430
Maybe you're so good.

3735
04:10:38,530 --> 04:10:39,210
You're so good.

3736
04:10:54,770 --> 04:10:55,250
Yeah!

3737
04:10:56,290 --> 04:10:56,970
Are you okay?

3738
04:10:57,310 --> 04:11:00,030
I can't talk to her anymore.

3739
04:11:01,110 --> 04:11:01,910
Okay, anyway.

3740
04:11:03,610 --> 04:11:04,910
Oh, whoa.

3741
04:11:05,590 --> 04:11:09,730
Welcome to the temple of the mystery of religion.

3742
04:11:11,010 --> 04:11:12,630
The temporary...

3743
04:11:12,630 --> 04:11:13,670
Wait, the temporary...

3744
04:11:13,670 --> 04:11:15,190
Wait, the temple of the mystery?

3745
04:11:15,570 --> 04:11:24,990
Those who preach love and mercy in God's name are often those who call for the death of heathens.

3746
04:11:27,310 --> 04:12:00,930
you believe in god my son um sure you are wise his mercy anoints us all and where doth he dwell the lord um and all of us oh i lied not just kidding But we shall open your eyes.

3747
04:12:01,530 --> 04:12:04,770
Even if we must shut down first.

3748
04:12:06,070 --> 04:12:07,070
What are you gonna do to me?

3749
04:12:07,670 --> 04:12:07,750
Oh.

3750
04:12:08,350 --> 04:12:10,930
Oh gosh, look at you.

3751
04:12:12,630 --> 04:12:12,990
Try?

3752
04:12:14,350 --> 04:12:15,890
Yeah, come here.

3753
04:12:16,730 --> 04:12:16,910
Oh.

3754
04:12:20,550 --> 04:12:21,210
Uh.

3755
04:12:22,170 --> 04:12:22,590
Uh.

3756
04:12:22,590 --> 04:12:22,750
Oh.

3757
04:12:22,750 --> 04:12:23,270
Examine the box.

3758
04:12:23,710 --> 04:12:24,150
These are...

3759
04:12:24,750 --> 04:12:25,570
There's...

3760
04:12:25,570 --> 04:12:26,030
Symbol...

3761
04:12:26,030 --> 04:12:27,290
Recepticles are symbolic of the box.

3762
04:12:27,310 --> 04:12:40,740
the promise of ultimate fulfillment um oh whoa why is why are we in the jungle now

3763
04:12:47,880 --> 04:13:04,500
a rotting remains of two children oh no a metal this poor woman has been viciously disemboweled uh where do i go Oh, this way?

3764
04:13:07,260 --> 04:13:07,940
What do you want here?

3765
04:13:08,480 --> 04:13:10,100
I'm just passing through.

3766
04:13:11,700 --> 04:13:12,800
You think it's that simple, huh?

3767
04:13:13,120 --> 04:13:14,280
Just passing through?

3768
04:13:14,500 --> 04:13:15,260
His voice does not suit him.

3769
04:13:15,260 --> 04:13:16,920
My family was just sitting around.

3770
04:13:17,800 --> 04:13:18,900
And look what it got them.

3771
04:13:20,960 --> 04:13:21,900
What is this?

3772
04:13:22,020 --> 04:13:24,140
The temple of the mystery of morality.

3773
04:13:24,680 --> 04:13:25,060
Okay.

3774
04:13:25,380 --> 04:13:27,160
My country paid me to kill.

3775
04:13:28,080 --> 04:13:30,800
And then when I came home, I was out of a job.

3776
04:13:31,400 --> 04:13:32,700
They expected me to stop.

3777
04:13:33,540 --> 04:13:34,360
Cold turkey?

3778
04:13:35,040 --> 04:13:35,780
Is that what they wanted?

3779
04:13:36,320 --> 04:13:38,300
A paycheck today, jail cell tomorrow?

3780
04:13:39,660 --> 04:13:41,660
Am I a criminal or an entrepreneur?

3781
04:13:43,400 --> 04:13:44,660
Hey, let's find out.

3782
04:13:44,700 --> 04:13:45,660
Might not have to fight you too.

3783
04:13:45,960 --> 04:13:46,480
All right, come here.

3784
04:13:54,180 --> 04:13:56,140
I'm too good with this sight, man.

3785
04:13:57,080 --> 04:13:58,060
A bloody corpse.

3786
04:13:59,160 --> 04:14:00,080
A nice lamp.

3787
04:14:03,780 --> 04:14:04,840
Anyway, there was a door over here.

3788
04:14:04,960 --> 04:14:05,680
Oh, hello.

3789
04:14:06,720 --> 04:14:09,340
Welcome to the Temple of the Mystery of Flesh, Steven.

3790
04:14:09,360 --> 04:14:10,100
Oh my god!

3791
04:14:10,480 --> 04:14:10,760
Have a bite!

3792
04:14:11,000 --> 04:14:12,020
Why are you here?

3793
04:14:12,160 --> 04:14:13,060
Mr. Potsdam!

3794
04:14:13,460 --> 04:14:14,480
The mystery is this.

3795
04:14:15,020 --> 04:14:18,760
Sometimes you have to lose some meat to get some meat.

3796
04:14:19,520 --> 04:14:23,380
They wouldn't let me in until I demonstrated my worthiness.

3797
04:14:24,100 --> 04:14:28,520
My invitation came after I buried Karen alive.

3798
04:14:29,280 --> 04:14:30,740
That showed initiative.

3799
04:14:31,620 --> 04:14:34,420
And her spinal cord was your ticket in, right?

3800
04:14:35,060 --> 04:14:38,320
Yes, but to be initiated into the mysteries of the harvest.

3801
04:14:38,320 --> 04:14:39,100
He got in!

3802
04:14:39,120 --> 04:14:40,320
I had to do one last thing.

3803
04:14:40,600 --> 04:14:40,720
Oh, no.

3804
04:14:41,040 --> 04:14:44,860
I left them into the house and into Stephanie's bedroom.

3805
04:14:48,580 --> 04:14:50,240
You do that to your own daughter?

3806
04:14:50,440 --> 04:14:55,180
Sometimes you have to sacrifice meat to gain meat the order taught me that.

3807
04:14:55,480 --> 04:14:56,240
Oh my god, Mr. Potsdam.

3808
04:14:56,660 --> 04:14:57,540
Now I am a butcher.

3809
04:14:58,160 --> 04:15:00,720
You should have gotten your dad to hire me on.

3810
04:15:01,160 --> 04:15:03,000
That way, I can't wait to kill this guy.

3811
04:15:05,360 --> 04:15:06,160
Prime cut.

3812
04:15:06,520 --> 04:15:06,780
Come here.

3813
04:15:07,000 --> 04:15:07,080
Oh.

3814
04:15:09,180 --> 04:15:10,300
I should have been saving.

3815
04:15:10,480 --> 04:15:11,040
Sorry, guys.

3816
04:15:12,220 --> 04:15:12,540
It's fine.

3817
04:15:12,620 --> 04:15:13,500
I have to go through these again.

3818
04:15:13,780 --> 04:15:14,540
They're not so bad.

3819
04:15:17,320 --> 04:15:18,140
Where are you going?

3820
04:15:20,760 --> 04:15:22,260
Where are you going, buddy?

3821
04:15:22,860 --> 04:15:23,980
I don't think I have.

3822
04:15:24,060 --> 04:15:25,480
I think I can only use this, though.

3823
04:15:25,920 --> 04:15:27,540
What do I do with this Cupid doll?

3824
04:15:28,360 --> 04:15:29,480
Wait, I have nails.

3825
04:15:31,040 --> 04:15:31,900
Nails on the nail.

3826
04:15:31,900 --> 04:15:32,760
Well, that didn't work.

3827
04:15:32,980 --> 04:15:33,680
Okay, just kidding.

3828
04:15:33,860 --> 04:15:34,940
We have nails for no reason.

3829
04:15:34,960 --> 04:15:47,400
reason I guess needed a sensor for that my bad come here wish I could just leave

3830
04:15:53,710 --> 04:16:08,850
oh I have one left do I have any bullets no dang I do have like a baseball bat We'll use the size though.

3831
04:16:09,870 --> 04:16:11,110
Here we go.

3832
04:16:13,570 --> 04:16:13,970
Kiwawa!

3833
04:16:14,270 --> 04:16:16,290
Thank you for the re-direct!

3834
04:16:17,130 --> 04:16:17,690
Oh my gosh.

3835
04:16:17,810 --> 04:16:18,970
Wait, he's good.

3836
04:16:22,630 --> 04:16:23,870
Oh shoot, I died.

3837
04:16:25,670 --> 04:16:26,250
Hi KFP!

3838
04:16:26,910 --> 04:16:28,530
I'm playing a really weird game.

3839
04:16:29,510 --> 04:16:30,710
Wait, when did I last save?

3840
04:16:31,770 --> 04:16:32,590
Oh, I saved that there.

3841
04:16:32,670 --> 04:16:33,690
I mean, you're so good.

3842
04:16:33,810 --> 04:16:34,450
You're so good.

3843
04:16:37,230 --> 04:16:39,130
That's fine, that's fine.

3844
04:16:39,670 --> 04:16:40,270
Ignore.

3845
04:16:40,930 --> 04:16:42,410
Oh no, I have to do this again.

3846
04:16:42,630 --> 04:16:43,890
Wait, I know the answers.

3847
04:16:45,430 --> 04:16:46,430
I know the answers.

3848
04:16:46,810 --> 04:16:46,830
Yes.

3849
04:16:47,190 --> 04:16:47,810
You are one.

3850
04:16:48,210 --> 04:16:49,090
He's in heaven.

3851
04:16:50,330 --> 04:16:50,930
Indeed!

3852
04:16:51,750 --> 04:16:54,450
Any other response would be blasphemous.

3853
04:16:54,730 --> 04:16:55,950
Thank you!

3854
04:16:55,970 --> 04:16:56,910
Answer me this.

3855
04:16:57,430 --> 04:16:59,350
If the word be with you.

3856
04:17:01,190 --> 04:17:03,310
Does the Lord bounce on a spring?

3857
04:17:04,210 --> 04:17:06,410
Or frolic with the wombats?

3858
04:17:07,110 --> 04:18:12,490

Brazil.

3860
04:18:24,650 --> 04:18:27,630
Why'd they sign up to Brazil?

3861
04:18:30,750 --> 04:18:31,650
Why?

3862
04:18:36,050 --> 04:18:41,130
I feel like I have to pick Brazil because I literally lamented about it yesterday.

3863
04:18:41,190 --> 04:18:42,910
You are correct!

3864
04:18:43,990 --> 04:18:45,470
Pass in peace, brother.

3865
04:18:50,150 --> 04:18:51,630
Oh my god.

3866
04:18:54,030 --> 04:18:55,030
Door is locked.

3867
04:18:55,470 --> 04:18:56,590
No stinking way.

3868
04:18:57,310 --> 04:19:00,730
I'm so angry right now.

3869
04:19:07,410 --> 04:19:08,270
My god.

3870
04:19:10,210 --> 04:19:11,170
Brazil!

3871
04:19:16,280 --> 04:19:18,400
Don't mind the dead people.

3872
04:19:19,460 --> 04:19:20,260
I'm just...

3873
04:19:20,260 --> 04:19:21,580
Oh, this...

3874
04:19:21,800 --> 04:19:24,180
Oh, uh, what, uh, you killed your family?

3875
04:19:24,660 --> 04:19:24,720
Oh.

3876
04:19:25,100 --> 04:19:26,900
My country pays me to kill.

3877
04:19:27,920 --> 04:19:30,280
And no one- Okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3878
04:19:31,800 --> 04:19:32,860
Oh my gosh.

3879
04:19:33,000 --> 04:19:33,600
Ow, ow.

3880
04:19:33,840 --> 04:19:34,260
Please.

3881
04:19:37,880 --> 04:19:39,460
I can't take the lamp.

3882
04:19:40,160 --> 04:19:42,960
I wish they gave you anything for the healing or anything.

3883
04:19:43,360 --> 04:19:43,620
Okay.

3884
04:19:44,560 --> 04:19:46,000
Mint is some kind of prophet.

3885
04:19:46,280 --> 04:19:46,580
Oh, wait.

3886
04:19:46,660 --> 04:19:47,280

Okay, guys.

3900
04:21:04,990 --> 04:21:08,450
Is that a box of shotgun shells as your second inventory item?

3901
04:21:09,250 --> 04:21:09,830
No.

3902
04:21:10,230 --> 04:21:12,230
It's a librarian's clue.

3903
04:21:13,630 --> 04:21:15,070
This is shotgun shells.

3904
04:21:16,730 --> 04:21:17,750
Oh, man.

3905
04:21:17,910 --> 04:21:19,170
Why doesn't it work?

3906
04:21:22,830 --> 04:21:24,650
Why would it work?

3907
04:21:24,830 --> 04:21:26,730
Why won't the nails work on the nail gun?

3908
04:21:27,490 --> 04:21:29,210
I don't get it.

3909
04:21:31,250 --> 04:21:33,510
There's a refill for all guns in the jungle hut.

3910
04:21:34,190 --> 04:21:34,690
There is?

3911
04:21:35,030 --> 04:21:35,910
Wait, should I reload?

3912
04:21:36,630 --> 04:21:39,650
Wait, what did I...

3913
04:21:46,240 --> 04:21:48,000
No, I was right clicking them, yeah.

3914
04:21:53,260 --> 04:21:54,120
This doesn't work.

04:22:38,280 --> 04:22:39,860
A pack of chainsaw.

3919
04:22:41,700 --> 04:22:43,180
There's like nothing else in here, though.

3920
04:22:45,880 --> 04:22:46,980
Operate the can.

3921
04:22:52,680 --> 04:22:53,600
Operate the box.

3922
04:22:53,680 --> 04:22:54,920

3923
04:22:55,320 --> 04:22:58,120

Awesome, awesome.

Save.

3927
04:23:03,980 --> 04:23:08,480
Oh, whoever told me that thing Thank you so much.

3928
04:23:09,400 --> 04:23:09,880
Thank you.

3929
04:23:10,020 --> 04:23:11,060
Probably save the run.

3930
04:23:12,960 --> 04:23:14,880
You probably save the run.

3931
04:23:15,340 --> 04:23:17,880
I would have had to use cheats and I don't even know how to use those.

3932
04:23:19,980 --> 04:23:20,820
Oh, and I feel refreshed.

3933
04:23:20,920 --> 04:23:21,160
Oh, wait.

3934
04:23:21,220 --> 04:23:26,620
Sorry, I'm going to save again because I just realized that that saves or that gave me more health.

3935
04:23:29,080 --> 04:23:29,260
Yeah.

3936
04:23:30,280 --> 04:23:34,360
Okay, we'll save the gun for Peploni, man.

3937
04:23:35,700 --> 04:23:39,660
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3938
04:23:39,660 --> 04:23:40,500
Okay, come here.

3939
04:23:46,300 --> 04:23:48,380
I don't even think I took damage.

3940
04:23:48,680 --> 04:23:49,460
Look at that face.

3941
04:23:50,100 --> 04:23:52,020
That's of a fresh young man.

3942
04:23:53,380 --> 04:23:53,900
Clean.

3943
04:23:54,080 --> 04:23:55,300
That was so clean.

3944
04:23:56,420 --> 04:23:57,800
We'll save over pepperoni.

3945
04:24:04,410 --> 04:24:04,950
Oh, wait.

3946
04:24:05,730 --> 04:24:09,790
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3947
04:24:09,790 --> 04:24:10,630
Blah, blah.

3948
04:24:11,170 --> 04:24:11,410
Blah.

3949
04:24:12,110 --> 04:24:12,550
Oh!

3950
04:24:12,830 --> 04:24:14,290
He's actually coming towards me this time!

3951
04:24:23,300 --> 04:24:25,240
Door is locked from the other side.

3952
04:24:25,360 --> 04:24:26,380
Let's go!

3953
04:24:30,540 --> 04:24:32,800
This one is called Salamic.

3954
04:24:34,160 --> 04:24:37,120
I don't know why sometimes it does caps, but my caps lock is not on.

3955
04:24:38,480 --> 04:24:38,920
Okay!

3956
04:24:40,040 --> 04:24:40,480
Onwards!

3957
04:24:42,920 --> 04:24:43,360
Oh!

3958
04:24:44,460 --> 04:24:45,360
Hello, handsome.

3959
04:24:45,400 --> 04:24:46,700
Looking for a good time and a good time.

3960
04:24:46,720 --> 04:24:47,920
a reasonable price

3961
04:24:52,400 --> 04:25:04,460
I'd love to get it on with the ladies all right that'd be $200 oh wait I think I have that here it is 200 bucks all right honey one of the wait should I be hold on I'm gonna get it

3962
04:25:07,780 --> 04:25:08,660

3963
04:25:11,940 --> 04:25:18,480
okay I thought it was her boobs thanks for stopping by stud you shouldn't have picked crystal though She hasn't been feeling well.

3964
04:25:19,020 --> 04:25:21,460
I'd be sure to get to a doctor if I were you.

3965
04:25:21,900 --> 04:25:23,100
These diseases can help.

3966
04:25:23,780 --> 04:25:25,740
Sorry, I don't even want to look at that myself.

3967
04:25:28,480 --> 04:25:28,960
Um.

3968
04:25:31,400 --> 04:25:32,660
I hated that.

3969
04:25:33,680 --> 04:25:34,400
Maybe she's a zombie.

3970
04:25:34,460 --> 04:25:35,720
So wait, was that a zombie?

3971
04:25:39,630 --> 04:25:40,390
What's that?

3972
04:25:40,550 --> 04:25:40,950
Mirror.

3973
04:25:41,290 --> 04:25:42,090
A hand mirror.

3974
04:25:42,690 --> 04:25:43,230
I'll take it.

3975
04:25:47,130 --> 04:25:47,610
Oh.

3976
04:25:47,850 --> 04:25:48,030
Whoa.

3977
04:25:48,230 --> 04:25:48,390
Whoa.

3978
04:25:50,990 --> 04:25:52,870
Okay, we could just go.

3979
04:25:54,190 --> 04:25:56,090
Oh my gosh, it's a good thing I stole all that money!

3980
04:25:57,870 --> 04:25:58,990
Or maybe not.

3981
04:25:59,550 --> 04:26:00,910
Honestly, I'm not quite... Wait.

3982
04:26:01,630 --> 04:26:02,590
Okay, let's go.

3983
04:26:07,770 --> 04:26:10,830
Welcome to the temple of beauty.

3984
04:26:12,370 --> 04:26:14,290
And am I not beautiful, O man?

3985
04:26:15,430 --> 04:26:16,770
Look at my hair.

3986
04:26:17,510 --> 04:26:19,230
Black as a moonless night.

3987
04:26:19,310 --> 04:26:19,670
Oh.

3988
04:26:20,270 --> 04:26:21,890
Look into my eyes.

3989
04:26:22,730 --> 04:26:23,850
Am I taking damage?

3990
04:26:23,990 --> 04:26:25,250
Wait, am I taking damage now for real?

3991
04:26:25,450 --> 04:26:26,730
Look at my complexion.

3992
04:26:27,350 --> 04:26:29,770
Pale white and glistening.

3993
04:26:31,290 --> 04:26:31,810
Um...

3994
04:26:31,810 --> 04:26:33,090
You're not that hot.

3995
04:26:33,390 --> 04:26:34,470
Get over it, Toots.

3996
04:26:34,770 --> 04:26:36,090
You bastard!

3997
04:26:37,570 --> 04:26:38,370
You feel the pain?

3998
04:26:38,630 --> 04:26:39,590
Oh, no!

3999
04:26:55,790 --> 04:26:57,750
Okay, I'm gonna load my save.

4000
04:27:04,380 --> 04:27:07,460
Well, it was worth it so we could see what happened, I suppose.

4001
04:27:09,960 --> 04:27:11,500
What was her name?

4002
04:27:11,880 --> 04:27:12,200
Christina!

4003
04:27:14,040 --> 04:27:15,240
No way.

4004
04:27:15,960 --> 04:27:17,500
Scorn mixed with desire.

4005
04:27:17,800 --> 04:27:18,580
That's our lot.

4006
04:27:20,060 --> 04:27:21,360
Such is the mystery of lust.

4007
04:27:21,920 --> 04:27:28,600
So often the instruments of lust as all instruments of higher pleasure are condemned as frequently as they are sought after.

4008
04:27:29,240 --> 04:27:35,000
I'd go on about the hypocrisy of a hedophobic society, but I think I'd rather just kill me a man.

4009
04:27:36,040 --> 04:27:36,360
Oh.

4010
04:27:37,740 --> 04:27:38,180
Okay.

4011
04:27:45,660 --> 04:27:46,540
See ya.

4012
04:27:50,660 --> 04:27:51,540
See ya.

4013
04:27:52,160 --> 04:27:53,100
Oh, I forgot to save.

4014
04:27:53,320 --> 04:27:53,660
That's okay.

4015
04:27:56,980 --> 04:27:59,200
Um, I want to see if you're incredibly beautiful.

4016
04:27:59,400 --> 04:27:59,580
How much?

4017
04:28:00,580 --> 04:28:01,400
Oh, what do you mean what else?

4018
04:28:02,260 --> 04:28:04,260
Your lips are like cherries.

4019
04:28:04,480 --> 04:28:05,360
And what else?

4020
04:28:07,980 --> 04:28:15,140
silk oh you're a little vain huh you insult my beauty oh the hand mirror

4021
04:28:20,260 --> 04:28:38,180
sorry guys i forgot to pick up the mirror i did it the first time i forgot this time so sorry ha hello handsome hello sure all right that'll be reasonable price.

4022
04:28:38,440 --> 04:28:40,680
You're saying my girls aren't worth a lousy 200 bucks?

4023
04:28:41,000 --> 04:28:42,160
You men are all the same.

4024
04:28:43,640 --> 04:28:44,920
Such is the mystery of lust.

4025
04:28:53,200 --> 04:28:56,580
It's because her body like covered it, you know.

4026
04:28:57,460 --> 04:29:02,120
Pick it up, put it in my pocket, and save the game.

4027
04:29:05,060 --> 04:29:06,180
Oh, salami.

4028
04:29:07,680 --> 04:29:07,960
Okay.

4029
04:29:08,320 --> 04:29:08,820
Next room.

4030
04:29:09,500 --> 04:29:10,060
Okay.

4031
04:29:13,660 --> 04:29:16,700
I wonder if I give her the mirror, what would happen?

4032
04:29:20,600 --> 04:29:21,000
You...

4033
04:29:21,000 --> 04:29:22,440
I love the way she walks.

4034
04:29:24,140 --> 04:29:25,300
She kind of looks like me.

4035
04:29:26,280 --> 04:29:27,660
Why are her hands like that?

4036
04:29:29,360 --> 04:29:30,400
Wait, is this the right way?

4037
04:29:30,660 --> 04:29:30,660
Wait.

4038
04:29:34,680 --> 04:29:36,500
Yeah, I was wondering if the mirror works on her.

4039
04:29:36,640 --> 04:29:37,660
Yeah, oh well.

4040
04:29:41,600 --> 04:29:42,700
Why are... Wait.

4041
04:29:44,380 --> 04:29:47,060
Why are her hands like that?

4042
04:29:50,780 --> 04:29:52,780
You can use the mirror on her, but you don't have to.

4043
04:29:53,320 --> 04:29:58,340
I think I've noticed that about this game a little bit is they give you multiple options.

4044
04:29:58,520 --> 04:29:58,940
It's kind of fun.

4045
04:30:00,820 --> 04:30:03,700
Welcome, initiate, to the temple of the mystery of pain.

4046
04:30:04,780 --> 04:30:05,920
The mystery is thus.

4047
04:30:06,740 --> 04:30:11,040
The simple manipulation of nerves may break one man and yet leave another.

4048
04:30:11,180 --> 04:30:12,120
It's getting a little creepy.

4049
04:30:12,460 --> 04:30:12,940
Crazy.

4050
04:30:18,460 --> 04:30:23,220
I mean, the game has already been so strange.

4051
04:30:23,620 --> 04:30:29,620
Although the body functions according to the tenets of science, the invocation of pain is an art.

4052
04:30:30,800 --> 04:30:32,320
Now it's getting crazy.

4053
04:30:34,360 --> 04:30:35,540
That's true.

4054
04:30:37,440 --> 04:30:38,740
Mmm, mummy, you're so good.

4055
04:30:39,720 --> 04:30:40,100
Mmm, mummy.

4056
04:30:40,460 --> 04:30:41,240
You're so good.

4057
04:30:41,780 --> 04:30:43,720
With the different applications.

4058
04:30:44,620 --> 04:30:46,170
Everybody's just a yopper.

4059
04:30:50,300 --> 04:30:53,540
I'm obsessed with these like two second cutscenes.

4060
04:30:54,580 --> 04:30:54,800
Ah!

4061
04:30:55,920 --> 04:30:58,460
Otherwise, I'll have to teach you the lesson.

4062
04:30:59,240 --> 04:30:59,620
Ah!

4063
04:31:03,840 --> 04:31:04,620
Oh!

4064
04:31:05,240 --> 04:31:05,800
Oh no!

4065
04:31:07,280 --> 04:31:07,940
Oh, okay.

4066
04:31:12,140 --> 04:31:13,680
I killed him.

4067
04:31:15,660 --> 04:31:17,700
A syringe marked vaccine.

4068
04:31:19,900 --> 04:31:21,020
No, use it on me.

4069
04:31:21,220 --> 04:31:21,940
Put it in my inventory.

4070
04:31:22,540 --> 04:31:23,000
There we go.

4071
04:31:24,440 --> 04:31:25,780
Why is it just like...

4072
04:31:25,780 --> 04:31:28,440
You got doing like the little nervous pee or the...

4073
04:31:28,440 --> 04:31:28,860
Like the...

4074
04:31:28,860 --> 04:31:29,700
You have the pee shuffle?

4075
04:31:31,680 --> 04:31:32,080
Inquisitor.

4076
04:31:32,740 --> 04:31:32,940
Okay.

4077
04:31:39,380 --> 04:31:39,780
Um...

4078
04:31:40,500 --> 04:31:42,720
The other club is two blocks down the road.

4079
04:31:43,780 --> 04:31:45,700
Oh, thank you so much for the five gift it.

4080
04:31:45,800 --> 04:31:46,480
Thank you.

4081
04:31:49,520 --> 04:31:50,040
No.

4082
04:31:50,700 --> 04:31:52,520
Welcome to the temple of the mystery.

4083
04:31:53,060 --> 04:31:54,000
No, it's What's his name?

4084
04:31:54,480 --> 04:31:55,400
What mystery is there in charity?

4085
04:31:55,640 --> 04:31:56,400
Wait, it's...

4086
04:31:56,400 --> 04:31:56,960
It's...

4087
04:31:56,960 --> 04:31:57,520
Oh, gosh.

4088
04:31:58,080 --> 04:31:59,100
The mystery is the...

4089
04:31:59,100 --> 04:31:59,820
It's the...

4090
04:31:59,820 --> 04:32:00,280
What's his...

4091
04:32:00,280 --> 04:32:00,980
It's Loomish!

4092
04:32:03,120 --> 04:32:07,260
...for in any charitable exchange, one must take from another.

4093
04:32:07,700 --> 04:32:10,000
And one has always left the poor.

4094
04:32:10,180 --> 04:32:11,560
Nah, I'm gonna kill Loomish.

4095
04:32:12,820 --> 04:32:13,340
Um...

4096
04:32:14,240 --> 04:32:16,360
The giver is not poorer.

4097
04:32:16,760 --> 04:32:19,040
He receives a great feeling from giving.

4098
04:32:19,120 --> 04:32:19,860
A feeling?

4099
04:32:20,980 --> 04:32:22,840
Discouraging answer, Initiate.

4100
04:32:23,160 --> 04:32:23,460
That's fine.

4101
04:32:23,640 --> 04:32:24,580
I'm going to kill you anyway.

4102
04:32:24,780 --> 04:32:26,120
Though I am needy.

4103
04:32:26,360 --> 04:32:29,740
I do not consider myself to pay so much as a...

4104
04:32:29,740 --> 04:32:31,400
They shouldn't have made him this guy.

4105
04:32:31,800 --> 04:32:33,080
It makes me want to kill him.

4106
04:32:33,900 --> 04:32:34,960
Give me something.

4107
04:32:37,380 --> 04:32:38,400
Go to hell!

4108
04:32:38,640 --> 04:32:40,220
I'm a taker, Initiate.

4109
04:32:41,260 --> 04:32:43,100
Allow me to take you there.

4110
04:32:43,780 --> 04:32:44,040
Whoa.

4111
04:32:44,480 --> 04:32:45,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4112
04:32:45,720 --> 04:32:45,820
Oh, oh, oh.

4113
04:32:46,360 --> 04:32:50,860
Oh my God, the way they explode.

4114
04:32:53,720 --> 04:32:54,120
Yeah.

4115
04:32:54,840 --> 04:32:56,720
Yeah, kill them, kill them.

4116
04:33:00,040 --> 04:33:01,580
Kill them all.

4117
04:33:02,140 --> 04:33:04,620
We're literally, how much longer is there?

4118
04:33:05,400 --> 04:33:06,080
My goodness.

4119
04:33:08,380 --> 04:33:10,540
Oh, what is this?

4120
04:33:10,900 --> 04:33:13,500
This is the temple of the mystery of mercy.

4121
04:33:13,740 --> 04:33:14,100
Okay.

4122
04:33:14,460 --> 04:33:15,220
You're just in time.

4123
04:33:15,240 --> 04:33:47,040
time for our little retirement ceremony as part of your initiation will be required to execute them that's how old people the old people are killed oh my god should be pretty easy but by retiring them will advance yourself hold they're begging for mercy do you grant it So silly.

4124
04:33:47,840 --> 04:33:49,200
I'll grant them mercy.

4125
04:33:49,460 --> 04:33:51,060
And unfortunately, the decision.

4126
04:33:52,340 --> 04:33:54,260
The loss is the mystery of mercy.

4127
04:33:55,220 --> 04:33:56,400
Life is a competition.

4128
04:33:56,540 --> 04:33:57,220
They were so...

4129
04:33:57,220 --> 04:33:58,480
Why are they like...

4130
04:33:58,480 --> 04:33:58,980
If they...

4131
04:33:58,980 --> 04:34:00,620
Why are we so small?

4132
04:34:00,940 --> 04:34:02,720
When you extend your support, you have to...

4133
04:34:02,720 --> 04:34:03,460
They come...

4134
04:34:03,460 --> 04:34:05,680
On their knees, they come up to my chin.

4135
04:34:07,660 --> 04:34:07,920
Ah!

4136
04:34:08,100 --> 04:34:08,280
Wait!

4137
04:34:08,480 --> 04:34:08,820
Oh gosh.

4138
04:34:09,320 --> 04:34:09,580
Sorry.

4139
04:34:10,980 --> 04:34:11,720
Oh my gosh.

4140
04:34:13,420 --> 04:34:15,220
I find an ancient sword.

4141
04:34:15,240 --> 04:34:16,940
Oh, my bad.

4142
04:34:29,010 --> 04:34:30,870
Let's slip up the finger.

4143
04:34:36,630 --> 04:34:37,150
Oopsie.

4144
04:34:37,650 --> 04:34:38,170

Oh, I can use it.

4148
04:34:45,410 --> 04:34:46,890
Um, anyway.

4149
04:34:49,950 --> 04:34:53,030
Yeah, I did take a lot of damage because I was...

4150
04:34:53,030 --> 04:34:54,270

No witnesses.

4156
04:35:50,480 --> 04:35:51,180
Wait, witnessing.

4157
04:35:51,800 --> 04:35:52,400
You know what, fine.

4158
04:35:52,600 --> 04:35:53,140
It's whatever.

4159
04:35:55,700 --> 04:35:57,680
I don't know why I wrote that.

4160
04:36:01,000 --> 04:36:01,480
Oh.

4161
04:36:04,120 --> 04:36:04,620

4165
04:36:15,130 --> 04:36:15,890
Oops.

4166
04:36:18,430 --> 04:36:18,930
Um.

4167
04:36:28,260 --> 04:36:29,780
Maybe I have to shoot him too.

4168
04:36:30,140 --> 04:36:30,600
Wait, I don't...

4169
04:36:30,600 --> 04:36:30,720
Wait.

4170
04:36:31,260 --> 04:36:32,140
Oh, I do have more ammo.

4171
04:36:34,800 --> 04:36:36,340
Oh, it's a circle.

4172
04:36:38,780 --> 04:36:39,040
Wait.

4173
04:36:40,880 --> 04:36:41,760
Oh, no!

4174
04:36:43,580 --> 04:36:45,560
I have to go all the way back through.

4175
04:36:46,060 --> 04:36:46,960
Oh, my gosh.

4176
04:36:47,580 --> 04:36:48,380
Okay, excuse me.

4177
04:36:48,460 --> 04:36:48,680
Sorry.

4178
04:36:48,760 --> 04:36:49,780
This is so awkward.

4179
04:36:50,360 --> 04:36:51,500
Okay, everybody, please don't.

4180
04:36:52,180 --> 04:36:53,000
So sorry.

4181
04:36:53,180 --> 04:36:54,680
My gosh, please excuse me.

4182
04:36:55,580 --> 04:36:56,960
This is so embarrassing.

4183
04:36:57,600 --> 04:36:59,140
It's just so yeah, okay.

4184
04:36:59,340 --> 04:37:00,380
It's this way anyway

4185
04:37:12,480 --> 04:37:21,760

4186
04:37:29,820 --> 04:37:33,380

04:37:39,240 --> 04:37:39,540
Oh, oops.

4189
04:37:39,720 --> 04:37:40,700
I didn't mean to click on me.

4190
04:37:44,880 --> 04:37:45,280
Um...

4191
04:37:45,280 --> 04:37:46,320
Are you crazy for good at?

4192
04:37:52,360 --> 04:37:52,760
Clean!

4193
04:38:01,800 --> 04:38:02,620
Wait, hold on.

4194
04:38:02,680 --> 04:38:04,160
Let me double check when my thing was.

4195
04:38:04,260 --> 04:38:05,340
Did I say 10 or 11?

4196
04:38:06,820 --> 04:38:07,120
Oops.

4197
04:38:09,900 --> 04:38:10,780
Okay, 11.

4198
04:38:10,920 --> 04:38:11,060
Good.

4199
04:38:11,260 --> 04:38:12,400
I gave myself plenty of time.

4200
04:38:14,260 --> 04:38:14,300
Okay.

4201
04:38:17,860 --> 04:38:18,480
Alright, let's save.

4202
04:38:21,140 --> 04:38:21,660

04:38:22,760 --> 04:38:23,400

04:38:28,000 --> 04:38:29,440
Oh, yeah, I did get the sword.

4206
04:38:29,900 --> 04:38:30,160
Yeah.

4207
04:38:32,860 --> 04:38:33,900
I think...

4208
04:38:33,900 --> 04:38:35,600
I don't know if it worked, though.

4209
04:38:37,960 --> 04:38:38,480
Okay.

4210
04:38:47,480 --> 04:38:47,940
Whoa,

4211
04:38:55,120 --> 04:38:55,840

4212
04:38:56,020 --> 04:38:56,740
I like that one.

4213
04:38:59,660 --> 04:38:59,880
Wait.

4214
04:39:01,380 --> 04:39:02,260
That was kind of cool.

4215
04:39:04,060 --> 04:39:05,960
We'll go over the no witnesses.

4216
04:39:08,480 --> 04:39:08,740
Cool.

4217
04:39:08,760 --> 04:39:40,620

4219
04:39:42,600 --> 04:39:46,420
You'll have to kill me to find out what he means, big guy.

4220
04:39:46,420 --> 04:39:48,000
Big guy.

4221
04:39:52,380 --> 04:39:54,720
He just fell apart.

4222
04:39:57,360 --> 04:40:06,280
This is always a great moment when the initiate passes over the threshold and becomes a brother.

4223
04:40:09,480 --> 04:40:13,780
I believe you have something for her.

4224
04:40:14,540 --> 04:40:15,040
I do?

4225
04:40:18,320 --> 04:40:19,220
The Cupid doll.

4226
04:40:20,360 --> 04:40:25,790
Ring the bell and...

4227
04:40:25,790 --> 04:40:26,590
Or is it?

4228
04:40:27,150 --> 04:40:30,730
Win the lovely lady as your prize.

4229
04:40:32,930 --> 04:40:34,030
Enough games.

4230
04:40:35,430 --> 04:40:36,390
Agreed.

4231
04:40:37,310 --> 04:40:37,490
What?

4232
04:40:43,850 --> 04:40:45,230
Oh!

4233
04:40:46,950 --> 04:40:47,830
Stephanie!

4234
04:40:52,050 --> 04:40:54,090
Each time you climb,

4235
04:40:57,420 --> 04:41:01,760
but you always hurt the ones you love.

4236
04:41:06,080 --> 04:41:07,520
Oh yeah!

4237
04:41:13,860 --> 04:41:15,720
I don't know if this game was serious.

4238
04:41:16,260 --> 04:41:18,200
Is that all you require?

4239
04:41:18,220 --> 04:41:19,960
What did I have?

4240
04:41:21,260 --> 04:41:23,160
I want an explanation.

4241
04:41:25,520 --> 04:41:26,720
Of course you do.

4242
04:41:27,640 --> 04:41:29,820
There are such things as monsters.

4243
04:41:30,880 --> 04:41:33,440
And yet, you've killed monsters.

4244
04:41:34,460 --> 04:41:38,040
Everything in the harvest is just slightly askew.

4245
04:41:38,740 --> 04:41:46,960
This is because, as advanced as our technology is, we cannot make the Sim any better than this.

4246
04:41:48,220 --> 04:41:57,570
Subjects subconscious always warms it to you're always a kidder man Jellybee thank you

4247
04:42:01,680 --> 04:42:11,100
Sam This is nothing more than a virtual reality Where's the matrix?

4248
04:42:12,300 --> 04:42:29,600
To test potential members Having successfully completed the program you have a earned the right to become a harvester oh my gosh wait what the hell is a harvester

4249
04:42:32,670 --> 04:42:41,040
that grips the knife that stabs the ones who move amid the crop the right hand and harvest

4250
04:42:45,610 --> 04:42:47,440
you're talking about people

4251
04:42:52,160 --> 04:43:02,100
again and again and again I believe the technical term is serial killer.

4252
04:43:02,300 --> 04:43:11,060
The harvester seek to perpetuate terror and discord for our own purposes.

4253
04:43:11,760 --> 04:43:21,900
We do this through the random utility of murder and we persevere through our recruitment of initiates like yourself.

4254
04:43:21,900 --> 04:43:23,540
I love that that's the technical term.

4255
04:43:25,320 --> 04:43:26,300
So there's just a...

4256
04:43:26,640 --> 04:44:37,920
want me to become a serial killer there's just um there's just a group of wait i think i belong here i've played oblivion reality has been engineered to break down the s3 program to desensitize you to violence now you may become a harvester and re-enter i told you it's the gateway prank or stay and spend the rest of your life first you scratch a car then you do arson then you become a serial killer what is the real serial prankster right now you are suspended in a sensory deprivation tank wired to a vr tank oh my god do you think we could go to harvester terminate your life support in vr chat those last minutes however will seem like a lifetime lived in harvest you will marry stephanie and die peacefully of old age

4257
04:44:41,220 --> 04:44:53,740
you're presuming a lot aside from you she is the only real person in harvest Suspended.

4258
04:44:53,760 --> 04:44:54,280
Oh, Harvest.

4259
04:44:54,640 --> 04:44:55,080
Sorry, I'm at Harvest.

4260
04:44:55,280 --> 04:44:55,280
Yeah.

4261
04:44:55,680 --> 04:44:57,900
Jacked in just as you are.

4262
04:44:58,520 --> 04:45:01,820
I assume you'll want to spend time together.

4263
04:45:04,880 --> 04:45:05,800
If I stay.

4264
04:45:08,740 --> 04:45:19,160
Of course, having completed your ordeal, you may leave with her as you intended and enjoy your victory.

4265
04:45:19,420 --> 04:45:20,580
Why does he look so sad?

4266
04:45:22,700 --> 04:45:23,980
join us.

4267
04:45:24,400 --> 04:45:30,860
The cost of exiting the lodge is the same as the cost of entering the lodge.

4268
04:45:31,420 --> 04:45:35,180
A skull and spinal cord.

4269
04:45:36,860 --> 04:45:41,660
The finger.

4270
04:45:42,700 --> 04:45:43,220
Oh my god.

4271
04:45:44,160 --> 04:45:44,460
Ma'am?

4272
04:45:45,820 --> 04:45:46,920
You couldn't.

4273
04:45:47,440 --> 04:45:49,560
He's so small.

4274
04:45:49,780 --> 04:45:51,220
These harvesters.

4275
04:45:52,700 --> 04:46:19,100
through this torture to give them a taste for killing the way to beat them is to deny them to live out your life here with me do we become a serial killer or do we get the hot girl didn't you hear what he said I do exist if you kill me here I'll die for real if you die in the game you die in real life because I'm real

4276
04:46:22,700 --> 04:46:27,300
What's a murder without pain and terror to

4277
04:46:31,840 --> 04:46:32,720
her brains?

4278
04:46:33,060 --> 04:46:36,500
And then for the plug, you will be a murderer.

4279
04:46:36,800 --> 04:46:38,580
It's so small.

4280
04:46:39,880 --> 04:46:41,280
So what will it be?

4281
04:46:41,680 --> 04:46:45,920
Life in harvest or life as a harvester.

4282
04:46:47,960 --> 04:46:49,480
Wait, I'd have to live here?

4283
04:46:50,080 --> 04:46:51,740
Well, please don't make me...

4284
04:46:53,140 --> 04:46:55,740
Oh God, please, wait, don't make me...

4285
04:47:00,500 --> 04:47:01,140
Don't...

4286
04:47:01,140 --> 04:47:02,160
Kill Stephanie!

4287
04:47:02,760 --> 04:47:03,480
Mary Stephanie!

4288
04:47:03,780 --> 04:47:04,620
Okay, good, I can save.

4289
04:47:04,940 --> 04:47:06,020
Okay, we'll do both.

4290
04:47:10,000 --> 04:47:12,720
I don't want to live in Harvest, though.

4291
04:47:17,620 --> 04:47:18,260
Hum...

4292
04:47:18,260 --> 04:47:21,340
Serial Killer...

4293
04:47:21,340 --> 04:47:22,700
Or Hot Girl.

4294
04:47:27,680 --> 04:47:29,700
Let's go with Kill Her first.

4295
04:47:36,300 --> 04:47:39,140
We'll kill her first and then we'll...

4296
04:47:40,820 --> 04:47:42,220
We'll live with her.

4297
04:47:43,520 --> 04:47:44,660
Please help me!

4298
04:47:45,160 --> 04:47:46,840
Dave, don't do this, please!

4299
04:47:47,520 --> 04:47:47,780
No!

4300
04:47:53,270 --> 04:47:54,870
Oh, I have to kill her!

4301
04:47:58,890 --> 04:47:58,930
Oh.

4302
04:47:58,930 --> 04:47:59,550
Oh.

4303
04:47:59,550 --> 04:47:59,610
Oh.

4304
04:47:59,610 --> 04:47:59,910
My butt.

4305
04:48:02,330 --> 04:48:03,010
Ah!

4306
04:48:03,190 --> 04:48:03,870
Ah!

4307
04:48:04,170 --> 04:48:04,850
Ah!

4308
04:48:15,080 --> 04:48:16,400
Oh no!

4309
04:48:16,760 --> 04:48:17,570
I'm sorry!

4310
04:48:18,840 --> 04:48:20,110
I was clicking too!

4311
04:48:24,860 --> 04:48:26,060
Wait, wait!

4312
04:48:28,100 --> 04:48:29,260
So sorry.

4313
04:48:29,440 --> 04:48:30,100
Oh my gosh.

4314
04:48:30,300 --> 04:48:30,820
I'm so sorry.

4315
04:48:30,980 --> 04:48:31,400
Okay, hold on.

4316
04:48:31,460 --> 04:48:32,540
Let me try that again.

4317
04:48:35,880 --> 04:48:36,520
Okay, kill.

4318
04:48:38,020 --> 04:48:39,080
Please help me!

4319
04:48:44,090 --> 04:48:45,970
Nice and slow.

4320
04:48:46,750 --> 04:48:48,830
Gentle clicks.

4321
04:48:49,850 --> 04:48:49,990
Okay.

4322
04:48:54,530 --> 04:48:55,890
Oh my god!

4323
04:48:56,390 --> 04:48:57,630
Oh my god!

4324
04:49:02,100 --> 04:49:06,380
Wait, he's a wide man standing in the back!

4325
04:49:07,360 --> 04:49:09,800
Wow, that was neat.

4326
04:49:13,880 --> 04:49:14,300
Wow.

4327
04:49:14,600 --> 04:49:16,000
Welcome to our order, brother.

4328
04:49:18,540 --> 04:49:19,460
Wow.

4329
04:49:20,260 --> 04:49:28,800
that was nice Oh no, he's not he's gonna be one of those serial killer hitchhiker guys.

4330
04:49:28,840 --> 04:49:33,480
Oh my god Where to

4331
04:49:37,520 --> 04:49:39,960
Where are you going?

4332
04:49:41,120 --> 04:49:41,460
Nowhere

4333
04:49:45,500 --> 04:49:48,080
What oh Oh my god

4334
04:49:53,470 --> 04:49:55,370
Why did it sound?

4335
04:49:55,390 --> 04:50:44,010
so sensual what are you doing saying playing harvester that thing I looked at it the other day the very thought breeding serial killers it's disgusting it's cool you'll rot your mind playing games like that don't you know people who watch violence become violent themselves oh no that's bullshit mom god my oh my god he's this is his mom's basement plays video games that make him roadrunner cartoon roadrunner cartoon roadrunner cartoon

4336
04:50:49,410 --> 04:50:50,950
roadrunner cartoon

4337
04:51:00,780 --> 04:51:02,140
Cannibalism!

4338
04:51:04,220 --> 04:51:08,000
Wait, I feel like we should have done that one last.

4339
04:51:13,250 --> 04:51:14,990
Roadrunner cartoons.

4340
04:51:15,510 --> 04:51:17,030
Roadrunner cartoons!

4341
04:51:21,770 --> 04:51:22,610
Cinematography.

4342
04:51:23,870 --> 04:51:25,090
Absolute cinema.

4343
04:51:27,490 --> 04:51:28,670
Oh no!

4344
04:51:30,610 --> 04:51:31,790
Oh my god!

4345
04:51:31,990 --> 04:51:33,050
This game was very in your face.

4346
04:51:33,510 --> 04:51:36,690
Response to the video games make you a killer hysteria of the 90s.

4347
04:51:37,090 --> 04:51:40,330
Even the skull and spinal cord thing is a direct reference to Mortal Kombat.

4348
04:51:41,010 --> 04:51:42,270
That's so cool!

4349
04:51:43,730 --> 04:51:44,570
Game over.

4350
04:51:45,190 --> 04:51:45,370
Okay.

4351
04:51:45,930 --> 04:51:49,790
I guess we do the good ending now, quote unquote, because this gives you a game over.

4352
04:51:51,490 --> 04:51:52,530
This ending is PM.

4353
04:51:52,630 --> 04:51:54,130
I like that ending so much.

4354
04:51:55,970 --> 04:51:56,450
Wow.

4355
04:51:57,050 --> 04:51:58,250
This is neat.

4356
04:51:59,470 --> 04:52:00,590
Okay, let's marry Stefan.

4357
04:52:00,610 --> 04:52:02,990
You disappoint me.

4358
04:52:03,570 --> 04:52:04,630
You had possibilities.

4359
04:52:08,440 --> 04:52:10,740
You died to become as twisted as you.

4360
04:52:13,780 --> 04:52:17,460
Your choice and succeeded in your quest.

4361
04:52:18,440 --> 04:52:20,340
Enjoy the life you've chosen.

4362
04:52:21,100 --> 04:52:22,820
Such as it is.

4363
04:52:27,520 --> 04:52:30,820
Why is he looked at- Oh my god, he marries us?

4364
04:52:31,140 --> 04:52:31,500
Hahaha!

4365
04:52:43,690 --> 04:52:44,690
Harvest properties

4366
04:52:49,920 --> 04:52:52,480
Wait, does the baby Is the baby also gonna...

4367
04:52:52,480 --> 04:52:52,580
Wait

4368
04:53:01,780 --> 04:53:17,520
Oh my god Oh my god What a waste This kid could have been something Never look back We got two more to plug in There's gotta be a better way to develop these serial killers This is scientific.

4369
04:53:18,400 --> 04:53:20,060
You want we should go back to the old way?

4370
04:53:21,000 --> 04:53:21,780
What old way?

4371
04:53:22,340 --> 04:53:23,080
Good breeding.

4372
04:53:29,350 --> 04:53:29,830
Ah,

4373
04:53:34,110 --> 04:53:35,130
I like the other ending way.

4374
04:53:35,270 --> 04:53:35,590
Way better.

4375
04:53:38,990 --> 04:53:40,430
The other ending was so much...

4376
04:53:40,430 --> 04:53:41,630
Let's watch it again.

4377
04:53:44,070 --> 04:53:45,510
The other ending was so good.

4378
04:53:47,070 --> 04:53:48,690
It still tells you game over.

4379
04:53:49,150 --> 04:53:50,010
Like you failed.

4380
04:53:51,010 --> 04:53:52,950
Makes me feel bad.

4381
04:53:53,490 --> 04:53:55,430
How come Steve gets to wear his clothes?

4382
04:53:55,790 --> 04:53:57,510
But Stephanie is in lingerie.

4383
04:53:58,450 --> 04:53:59,080
I don't know.

4384
04:54:01,030 --> 04:54:02,590
Roadrunner cartoons.

4385
04:54:04,470 --> 04:54:05,530
Please help me.

4386
04:54:05,850 --> 04:54:06,330
Oh,

4387
04:54:10,080 --> 04:54:10,400
please.

4388
04:54:14,800 --> 04:54:15,580
Yeah!

4389
04:54:32,540 --> 04:54:35,720
It's so crazy.

4390
04:54:37,880 --> 04:54:38,720
Wow.

4391
04:54:39,200 --> 04:54:40,100
That was neat.

4392
04:54:42,120 --> 04:54:42,400
That was neat.

4393
04:54:44,220 --> 04:54:46,540
Welcome to our order, brother.

4394
04:54:47,460 --> 04:54:49,180
Do you see his reflection?

4395
04:54:50,320 --> 04:54:54,300
The reflection above him makes me laugh so much.

4396
04:54:54,520 --> 04:54:56,020
He looks like big chungus.

4397
04:55:08,660 --> 04:55:09,640
Where are you?

4398
04:55:09,660 --> 04:55:21,860
going where are you going nowhere nowhere at all nowhere at all

4399
04:55:25,000 --> 04:55:33,400
vitality means phantom wins games are bad what are you doing

4400
04:55:36,680 --> 04:56:14,540
playing harvester playing harvester that's me right now i looked at it the other day the very thought breeding serial killers it's disgusting it's cool you'll rot your mind playing games like that don't you know people who watch violence become violent themselves that's bullshit mom it's no it isn't why do you think they started cutting the violence out of those roadrunner cartoons roadrunner cartoons Roadrunner cartoons.

4401
04:56:20,420 --> 04:56:22,260
Roadrunner cartoons.

4402
04:56:23,000 --> 04:56:24,060
Roadrunner cartoons.

4403
04:56:28,820 --> 04:56:32,440
This game is so...

4404
04:56:41,580 --> 04:56:43,080
Wow guys, we did it.

4405
04:56:43,260 --> 04:56:45,660
We beat Harvester.

4406
04:56:47,740 --> 04:56:49,620
That was so silly.

4407
04:56:51,140 --> 04:56:51,900
Roadrunner cartoons.

4408
04:56:53,140 --> 04:56:53,960
Roadrunner cartoons.

4409
04:57:06,900 --> 04:57:08,740
So funny.

4410
04:57:09,840 --> 04:57:10,460
So funny.

4411
04:57:12,460 --> 04:57:14,260
I hope you guys liked it.

4412
04:57:14,840 --> 04:57:18,300
That was an experience.

4413
04:57:19,060 --> 04:57:21,440
And I'm glad that we could all experience together.

4414
04:57:25,960 --> 04:57:27,260
Thanks for the streaming, though.

4415
04:57:27,420 --> 04:57:29,340
Who knew the real terror would be the broken mechanics?

4416
04:57:29,860 --> 04:57:33,240
Well, once that was fixed, it was fine, but...

4417
04:57:35,240 --> 04:57:35,860
Mm-hmm.

4418
04:57:37,460 --> 04:57:37,900
Sorry.

4419
04:57:38,380 --> 04:57:39,780
I got tilted at that point.

4420
04:57:42,000 --> 04:57:43,240
But we made it through.

4421
04:57:44,840 --> 04:57:47,360
Thank you for streaming this weird, wonderful game.

4422
04:57:48,020 --> 04:57:51,360
I think wonderful is a strong word for this game, but it was definitely weird.

4423
04:57:51,780 --> 04:57:52,820
I did that fine, of course.

4424
04:57:53,960 --> 04:57:55,360
serial killer is born!

4425
04:57:55,420 --> 04:57:55,920
Me!

4426
04:57:58,040 --> 04:57:58,860
Easy toot!

4427
04:57:59,800 --> 04:58:00,980
Thank you so much for the 20!

4428
04:58:01,520 --> 04:58:02,640
Thank you!

4429
04:58:03,840 --> 04:58:05,200
Steve or Halligan?

4430
04:58:05,800 --> 04:58:06,180
Hmm.

4431
04:58:06,180 --> 04:58:06,660
Halligan?

4432
04:58:08,020 --> 04:58:08,940
I don't know.

4433
04:58:09,820 --> 04:58:12,220
I feel like the ending...

4434
04:58:12,220 --> 04:58:13,080
I don't know.

4435
04:58:13,520 --> 04:58:14,540
I feel like...

4436
04:58:14,540 --> 04:58:16,660
Steve was so normal now.

4437
04:58:16,820 --> 04:58:17,760
Thank you so much for the movie!

4438
04:58:18,920 --> 04:58:21,180
I feel like Steve was so normal.

4439
04:58:21,260 --> 04:58:26,020
And then if you choose the ending where he becomes a serial killer, It's so like out of pocket for him.

4440
04:58:30,420 --> 04:58:32,180
Yeah, he escalated like crazy.

4441
04:58:32,740 --> 04:58:33,980
It's fun to watch you play him in.

4442
04:58:34,100 --> 04:58:35,340
If you want another good point, click try.

4443
04:58:35,440 --> 04:58:36,760
I have no mouth and I must scream.

4444
04:58:37,060 --> 04:58:38,240
Oh, I've heard of that one before.

4445
04:58:38,860 --> 04:58:38,860
Yeah.

4446
04:58:43,070 --> 04:58:44,810
What watching Minto does to someone.

4447
04:58:46,070 --> 04:58:47,810
Crazy, crazy craziness.

4448
04:58:48,490 --> 04:58:50,370
I can't get over.

4449
04:58:51,610 --> 04:58:52,570
Roadrunner cartoons.

4450
04:58:53,710 --> 04:58:54,670
Roadrunner cartoons.

4451
04:58:56,290 --> 04:58:59,050
This game has a lot of common with MGS if you think about it.

4452
04:58:59,730 --> 04:59:00,470
Kind of, yeah.

4453
04:59:01,170 --> 04:59:02,930
I can't...

4454
04:59:02,930 --> 04:59:04,810
Get over Roadrunner cartoons.

4455
04:59:08,230 --> 04:59:11,450
Time to watch the rest of the cutscenes you missed out on.

4456
04:59:13,590 --> 04:59:15,210
Maybe another time.

4457
04:59:15,670 --> 04:59:16,990
Thank you for the experience of Harvester.

4458
04:59:17,290 --> 04:59:17,650
Thank you!

4459
04:59:18,830 --> 04:59:19,390
Man.

4460
04:59:20,430 --> 04:59:23,290
Confident of... No, stop recommending games.

4461
04:59:23,370 --> 04:59:24,210
You guys are weird.

4462
04:59:32,940 --> 04:59:42,460
But anyway, I have an hour until I have stuff that I gotta go do, so I'm gonna go off and eat some dinner.

4463
04:59:43,580 --> 04:59:48,460
It's surprising I still have an appetite after literally everything that happened, but...

4464
04:59:49,100 --> 04:59:52,000
It was fun!

4465
04:59:52,540 --> 04:59:54,020
It was fine, it was fine, it was fine.

4466
04:59:54,240 --> 04:59:56,820
This was something...

4467
04:59:56,820 --> 05:00:01,300
I went in with zero knowledge of what to expect at all.

4468
05:00:03,060 --> 05:00:04,620
And here we are.

4469
05:00:06,280 --> 05:00:07,400
Giant Robot Fan.

4470
05:00:07,940 --> 05:00:08,580
Thank you!

4471
05:00:09,180 --> 05:00:10,780
Gotta play any more Kirby games.

4472
05:00:10,940 --> 05:00:12,920
I don't know if soon, but I do plan on...

4473
05:00:12,920 --> 05:00:14,620
I do want to play more Kirby, yes.

4474
05:00:16,880 --> 05:00:18,280
Play Metal Gear Solid.

4475
05:00:18,440 --> 05:00:19,880
I feel like you might like it.

4476
05:00:22,480 --> 05:00:23,720
Hmm, Metal Gear.

4477
05:00:24,100 --> 05:00:24,940
Never heard of it.

4478
05:00:25,380 --> 05:00:26,980
Bet you could go for a burger right now.

4479
05:00:27,640 --> 05:00:29,580
I had a burger for lunch.

4480
05:00:31,000 --> 05:00:31,920
And I'll do it again.

4481
05:00:32,000 --> 05:00:32,440
No, I'm just kidding.

4482
05:00:32,460 --> 05:00:32,740
kidding.

4483
05:00:33,440 --> 05:00:34,100
Found this?

4484
05:00:35,840 --> 05:00:36,340
Anyway.

4485
05:00:37,060 --> 05:00:37,720
Thank you, guys.

4486
05:00:38,580 --> 05:00:39,320
Metal gear.

4487
05:00:40,640 --> 05:00:41,640
Metal gear.

4488
05:00:42,200 --> 05:00:42,540
Oh, no.

4489
05:00:42,980 --> 05:00:43,740
Oh, my brain.

4490
05:00:44,400 --> 05:00:45,420
Wait, the thoughts.

4491
05:00:46,760 --> 05:00:47,640
S3 program.

4492
05:00:48,500 --> 05:00:48,860
Oh, okay.

4493
05:00:49,260 --> 05:00:50,780
It's starting to come back.

4494
05:00:51,380 --> 05:00:51,820
Oh, hell.

4495
05:00:52,360 --> 05:00:52,820
My heart.

4496
05:00:55,050 --> 05:00:57,090
Metal gear lives on through this arm.

4497
05:01:04,680 --> 05:01:06,260
Well, have you guys had fun?

4498
05:01:06,560 --> 05:01:07,520
Oh, we'll see you next time.

4499
05:01:07,620 --> 05:01:08,440
