1
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,140
Welcome back!

2
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,080
Yes.

3
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm scared!

4
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm scared!

5
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,640
Yeah, I became the juggler.

6
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,540
Look, you can do this.

7
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm scared of...

8
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't know!

9
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,280
Good morning!

10
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,460
I'm scared of...

11
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,520
I don't know.

12
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I'm not very good with card games.

13
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,020
And...

14
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,340
And stuff.

15
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,900
So I'm nervous!

16
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,120
But I felt like...

17
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,820
I want to know what Bellatio is like.

18
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
But I also...

19
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,980
Don't find myself ever trying it off stream.

20
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,430
So I...

21
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,100
I'm forcing myself...

22
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,780
Here and now.

23
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,240
Just take your time.

24
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I don't know.

25
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,940
Try not to be so...

26
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,540
Critical!

27
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,380
Looking sharp today, Minto.

28
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,800
Thank you.

29
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,600
How much was because of the clown girl art?

30
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
I did not see any clown girl art.

31
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,360
What are you talking about?

32
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,320
What's on your feed?

33
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,540
My cute adorable Minto, I hope you have a lot of fun.

34
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,520
Thank you!

35
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,030
I have not seen anything of...

36
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,770
This game.

37
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,070
I'll be honest, I know literally like...

38
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,030
All I've seen is...

39
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,810
I've seen some advertisements for it and that's about it.

40
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,630
I don't know anything.

41
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,230
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

42
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,830
Okay, I'll sing happy birthday and then we'll start.

43
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,530
Logan, thanks for the 5 gifted.

44
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,690
You're going into this blind?

45
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,750
Yeah?

46
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,230
Wait.

47
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,270
Is that something in the game?

48
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,630
Yeah, I'm going in blind.

49
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,870
I don't know anything.

50
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:23,170
I'll be trying to beat my best hand, E38.

51
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,310
That means nothing to me!

52
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,870
I don't know what that means!

53
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,730
I don't...

54
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,950
Yes, actually...

55
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,070
I don't know!

56
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,490
Liar in chat.

57
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:40,730
Why?

58
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,090
Hi!

59
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,230
Uh-oh.

60
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,850
Uh-oh.

61
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,590
Minto, hi.

62
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:46,910
Hello!

63
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,690
Don't worry, Minto.

64
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,770
Once you get the clown, the game gets real...

65
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,450
Has this game been falsely advertised to me?

66
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,490
Hi, Minky.

67
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,530
It's my birthday tomorrow.

68
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,490
Could I have a special Metal Gear birthday a day in advance?

69
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,290
Love me not!

70
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,370
Since I'm not streaming tomorrow.

71
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,250
Happy birthday!

72
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,290
Congratulations!

73
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,190
Happy birthday!

74
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,350
Salutations!

75
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,270
Happy birthday!

76
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,930
May your sky stay blue!

77
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,770
Happy birthday to you!

78
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,430
Love me not!

79
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,010
Happy birthday!

80
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,110
This is a backseater game.

81
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,690
No, no!

82
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:28,770
No!

83
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,510
No backseating!

84
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,610
Unless I ask.

85
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,350
I want to learn properly.

86
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,270
No backseating!

87
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,690
Maybe I should put that on my head.

88
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,510
Yeah, no help.

89
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,030
No...

90
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,190
No...

91
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,590
Help.

92
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,740
Help.

93
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Unless I ask.

94
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,540
No help.

95
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,900
I'd rather not.

96
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,220
Thanks for the 10 gift card!

97
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

98
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,240
Thank you.

99
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,420
What was I going to say?

100
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,100
I don't remember.

101
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,160
Thank you for the 20 gift card!

102
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Thank you!

103
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,300
Thank you so much!

104
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,420
Thank you for the gift card.

105
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,840
So yeah.

106
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,760
How long before she asks?

107
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,220
Stop!

108
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,200
Stop!

109
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,000
No!

110
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,700
Okay.

111
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
Why are you pixelated?

112
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,120
I don't know.

113
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,400
I felt like I wanted to join in on the game.

114
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,420
Is it too much?

115
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,420
I thought maybe it was immersion.

116
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,120
I'll turn it off.

117
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,980
More pixel.

118
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,580
Let's see how pixel-y we can get.

119
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,240
It's just like my Japanese doujinshi.

120
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,340
You can't even see my... Oh my god!

121
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,380
You can only see my nose.

122
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,470
Okay guys, this is how we're playing the game today.

123
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,350
Okay, okay, okay.

124
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,890
Okay, okay, okay.

125
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,090
Don't say dream woman.

126
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,330
I just told me I'm not allowed to backseat or she'll kill me.

127
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,570
But I really hope you have fun with this.

128
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,870
Blacho was my game of the year.

129
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,210
No!

130
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,670
Game of the year was Astro Bot.

131
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,650
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,610
I'm sorry you lost.

133
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,310
Oh my gosh, get over it.

134
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,050
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,410
Astro Bot won!

136
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,450
Gosh!

137
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,390
Jeez!

138
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,900
But thank you.

139
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,080
Alright, let's get into it.

140
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,760
I'm nervous.

141
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,580
I'm scared!

142
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,360
Is this game scary?

143
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,120
The people demand crunchy looking mint.

144
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,060
Send your head below.

145
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,840
Thanks for the time.

146
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,220
Good play!

147
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,900
Hello there.

148
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,140
My name is Jimbo.

149
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,840
I'm here to help you learn how to play.

150
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,020
Okay.

151
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,360
Your goal is to earn chips and to defeat the enemy blind.

152
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,820
Is that his name?

153
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,480
This is named blind?

154
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,020
Mr. Blind?

155
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,230
Blind is a poker concept.

156
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,850
Okay, we're already off to a really great start.

157
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,050
I thought the guy's name...

158
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,390
I was like, why did your parents hurt you?

159
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,470
Why do they hate you?

160
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,450
Hello child.

161
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,730
We care not to see you.

162
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,670
You are blind.

163
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,550
They're cursing him from the start.

164
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:32,650
Okay.

165
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,490
What's scary is your free time disappearing forever.

166
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,310
I have other means of things that cause that to happen.

167
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,950
Here, this here is a small blind.

168
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,690
You only need to score 300 chips to beat it.

169
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,310
Select a small blind to start the round.

170
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,610
You earn chips by playing poker hands.

171
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,810
I don't know poker.

172
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,790
I don't know poker!

173
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,010
Only four people have died playing this game.

174
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,790
None of them are Ghostmates, so the odds are in your favor.

175
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,130
What if I'm the first?

176
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,130
I want to go down in history.

177
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,500
You earn chips by playing poker hands.

178
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,060
Each poker hand earns a base amount of chips multiplied by some...

179
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh, I thought that said nut.

180
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,100
Molt?

181
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,680
What does that mean?

182
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,720
Oh, like a multiplier.

183
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:39,860
Multiplier.

184
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,420
See your poker hands in the run info area.

185
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,360
Along with other info about your current run.

186
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,920
Oh my gosh, they help you.

187
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,620
Four of a kind.

188
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
Why is that three there?

189
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,120
Who invited?

190
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,240
Bro thinks he's part of the team.

191
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,040
Five cards in a row.

192
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,460
All consecutive ranks with all cards sharing the same suit.

193
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,680
He's emotional support.

194
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,700
A three of a kind and a pair.

195
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,800
Alright.

196
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,320
We got the thruple and the couple.

197
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,940
That's a full house, alright.

198
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,080
Poker, I barely even know her.

199
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:45,980
Flush.

200
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,440
Five cards that share the same suit.

201
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,380
Okay.

202
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,220
Five cards in a row.

203
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,120
Okay, just normal.

204
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,240
Okay, straight flush is when they're all the same suit.

205
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,120
And then straight is they're just, they don't all have the same suit.

206
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,040
Straight flush is me talking to a pretty lady.

207
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,780
Three of a kind.

208
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,720
It's the six and the five, you get out of here.

209
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,480
Three cards with the same rank.

210
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,240
They may be played up to two other unscored cards.

211
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,120
Two pair, okay?

212
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,240
Pair, okay?

213
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,420
High card.

214
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,920
If the played hand is not of any of the above hands, only the highest ranked card scores.

215
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,720
I have to have some real bad luck for that.

216
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,520
Couldn't beat me.

217
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,180
Cards also earn you chips.

218
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,720
Hover over to see.

219
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,920
Next.

220
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,780
Chips, chips, chips, chips.

221
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,040
Okay.

222
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,280
Okay, chips, chips, chips, chips.

223
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,880
Now select up to five cards to play and press play hand.

224
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,060
We have these three.

225
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,000
Wait, what is it?

226
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,420
Uh...

227
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,460
Uh...

228
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,160
Hold on.

229
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,420
Hold on, I'm not even looking at chat.

230
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,740
Don't tell me anything.

231
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,480
Don't tell me anything.

232
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,820
I could...

233
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,180
Oh, there it is.

234
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,860
No, it wasn't three of a kind.

235
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,420
Oh my gosh, I don't have shit.

236
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,380
It's like...

237
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,220
I have a pair.

238
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,080
Wait.

239
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,470
Wait, select up to five cards.

240
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,890
Oh, there it is, okay.

241
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,320
What's this one?

242
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,440
Oh, this is just the bigger bets.

243
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,560
What's a voucher?

244
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,700
No vouchers are deemed in this run.

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,440
I'm going couponing.

246
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,680
Okay.

247
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,160
We might be cooked.

248
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,160
I told you!

249
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,640
I told you.

250
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,320
Wait, how do I...

251
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,900
Wait, so I just select up to five.

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,220
What if I just play all of them?

253
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,400
Okay.

254
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,480
Goodbye cards.

255
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,760
You can also discard up to five cards.

256
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,760
Oh, what if I...

257
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,920
I don't like the guy that is...

258
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,600
He's faceless, so he's a little scary.

259
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,200
Bye bye.

260
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,380
Thank you.

261
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,140
Careful, you only have a limited number of hands and discards per round.

262
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,260
He's scary.

263
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,140
Faceless guy.

264
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,660
Earn 300 chips before you run out of hands to win this round.

265
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,180
Good luck.

266
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,860
Oh, I have to...

267
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:36,980
What?

268
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, okay.

269
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,780
Well, I have a four consecutive.

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,380
But they're not the same.

271
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,640
They're just like kind of the same.

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
Yeah, I'll make them all different so it's a little fancy.

273
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,940
Oh, play?

274
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,030
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

275
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,210
What did you guys say?

276
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,550
No!

277
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,230
Oh, it has to be five?

278
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,150
Wait, what?

279
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,560
Minto, have you played poker?

280
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,180
No.

281
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,770
It said that...

282
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,850
Wait, it said that...

283
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,260
I give up.

284
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,120
I give up.

285
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,380
I give up.

286
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,540
I give up.

287
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,580
How do I get out of this?

288
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,280
If I give all my hands away...

289
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,100
They'll never...

290
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,320
They'll never have anything.

291
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,650
I don't want to be here anymore.

292
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:28,830
Throw it...

293
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,240
Throw it away.

294
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,580
Throw it away.

295
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,320
Throw it away.

296
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,830
Wait, what was that?

297
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,070
Oh, wow.

298
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,190
It even says like...

299
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,690
Hey, you threw away that.

300
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,950
She's going full Jonkler.

301
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,550
I'm going to burn it down!

302
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,230
I'm going to burn it down!

303
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,650
I'm so confused.

304
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,610
So...

305
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,450
Okay.

306
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:06,170
So like, this would be a pair and then I just throw in a random card?

307
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,800
Why do I throw in a random card?

308
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,820
What was the point?

309
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,680
It didn't even give me any extra points.

310
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,220
People said I need to throw five.

311
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,640
But I threw five and it didn't even do anything.

312
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,100
You don't have to.

313
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,100
Then why did everybody say you have to?

314
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,020
Why did everybody say...

315
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,680
Oh, Minto, you didn't...

316
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,600
You didn't...

317
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,400
You have to have a fifth card.

318
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,680
That's what the rules...

319
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,820
That's what the tutorial said.

320
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,840
Why did they say that?

321
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,180
Chat...

322
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,700
Chat is too...

323
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,000
It's too much text.

324
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,740
TLDR.

325
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,180
TLDR, you guys.

326
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,240
Seriously, there's just too much text on the screen right now.

327
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,610
You guys are just...

328
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,130
You guys are like spamming the same thing over and over again.

329
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,590
Mods, can we get in here?

330
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,030
Can we get someone in here?

331
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,530
Okay, anyway.

332
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,990
Two pairs.

333
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,210
Wait, so I can either play my hand or...

334
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,830
Or discard.

335
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,590
Oh, how did I lose?

336
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,230
Wait, bluffing?

337
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,050
What happened?

338
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,010
Oh, you have a certain number of hands?

339
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,110
They didn't tell you that.

340
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,580
What was this?

341
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,840
Black stake.

342
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,100
Orange stake.

343
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,920
Stake.

344
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,920
Green stake.

345
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,120
I'm green.

346
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,060
Okay, anyway.

347
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,460
Alright.

348
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,460
I'll actually try this time, you guys.

349
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,140
I'll actually try.

350
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:24,840
Okay.

351
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,360
Okay.

352
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,180
Okay.

353
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,700
Oh, stake.

354
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,280
That's what I'm thinking.

355
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,180
Stake.

356
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,020
Okay.

357
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,300
Okay.

358
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,440
So, if I'm just like...

359
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,840
Two pair.

360
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,500
Or if I'm like a pair.

361
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,620
I have nothing else.

362
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,640
I can just throw this out.

363
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,820
And then if I'm like...

364
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,740
Oh, I want to discard the two.

365
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,780
I can just do whatever.

366
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,960
It doesn't have to be like...

367
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,500
Stop saying run info.

368
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,980
I literally read it.

369
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,640
I read it.

370
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,600
Stop saying it.

371
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,620
It just won't help with the score.

372
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,100
Okay, yeah.

373
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,820
That's what I figured.

374
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,420
No, you did not.

375
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,220
What are you talking about?

376
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,720
I literally looked at these.

377
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,840
Yeah, this is why AstroBot won in this loss.

378
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,480
So true.

379
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:14,990
Anyway.

380
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,670
Okay.

381
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:31,780
Okay.

382
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,330
I thought you were really focused.

383
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,910
I went to...

384
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,130
Wait.

385
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,910
I said I went to go get water.

386
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,030
Oh, I didn't?

387
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,710
No, I said it though.

388
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,010
I think maybe I said it...

389
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,750
Maybe I'm muted.

390
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,750
I said it...

391
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,430
Wait.

392
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,790
I thought I said it before I muted.

393
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,950
Oopsie.

394
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,030
Astro, I said it...

395
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,270
You guys are not mind readers.

396
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,410
How could you not read my brain?

397
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,970
I literally said it.

398
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,110
How

399
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,380
many hands do I have?

400
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,800
Oh, three.

401
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,700
And four discards.

402
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,540
Okay.

403
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,420
Okay.

404
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,040
So I can like play this.

405
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,120
It's like...

406
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,640
If I...

407
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:07,960
Okay.

408
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,680
I should have done a hand camera.

409
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,460
Okay.

410
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,280
Okay.

411
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:31,900
Okay.

412
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,980
Oh!

413
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,760
I almost have...

414
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,140
If only I had...

415
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,640
Can I...

416
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,140
Can I tell this one to turn into a four?

417
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,700
Can I say...

418
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,840
Can I give it money?

419
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,320
And say...

420
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,020
Turn into a four.

421
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,980
I can just discard it.

422
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,140
But what if I don't get it?

423
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,300
Discard.

424
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,540
Oh!

425
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,600
Oh, wait.

426
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,020
No!

427
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,540
Banish it to the shadow realm.

428
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,440
Use your discards.

429
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,700
Should I do it again?

430
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,840
Okay.

431
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,520
I'm gonna...

432
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,320
I'm gonna discard the ten too.

433
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,540
Oh, but what...

434
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,760
But what if I...

435
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,320
Oh, I threw away my jack.

436
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,200
Okay, get discard.

437
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,020
This game hates me!

438
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,680
Wait, I have a question.

439
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,340
If I...

440
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,060
Okay, say I'm like...

441
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,220
If I discard all of these cards at once...

442
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,020
I have one discard left, so it's not the number.

443
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
It's just the...

444
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,760
So a discard is...

445
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,540
You...

446
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,160
It counts like a hand.

447
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,500
Okay, correct.

448
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,340
Okay, okay.

449
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,020
Well, I have...

450
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,500
I have two pairs.

451
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,860
I don't think I'll get enough if I...

452
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,240
I don't know if I'll get enough.

453
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,300
Oh, no!

454
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,280
Wait, does that mean...

455
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,580
All the fours are gone?

456
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,180
I could get a nine.

457
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,070
I'm too stupid for all this.

458
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,030
Don't worry, me too.

459
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,210
That's why I didn't want to play this on stream.

460
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,730
Oh, that means they're all of...

461
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,590
Oh, they haven't...

462
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,050
Okay, okay.

463
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,350
So the one is that...

464
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,630
What the hell then?

465
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,830
This game hates me.

466
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,650
This game hates me.

467
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,320
Okay, one more.

468
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,340
Actually...

469
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
You know what?

470
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,840
I don't care.

471
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
I don't care!

472
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,560
We're so close!

473
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,500
I'm gonna get rid

474
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,260
of...

475
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,880
I'm gonna get rid of it all.

476
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,560
I'm gonna get rid of all four of these.

477
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,720
Wait, what's a flush?

478
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,120
What's a flush?

479
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,640
Wait, a flush?

480
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,740
Five cards...

481
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,660
One, two, three, four...

482
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,120
Just kidding!

483
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,620
I'm playing it!

484
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,300
My friends are gaslighting me to pick this game up.

485
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,760
Should I?

486
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,900
Only if you want to feel like a real bozo.

487
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,600
I get three dollars?

488
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,060
I'm gonna go buy ice cream!

489
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,080
Wait, cash out.

490
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,260
Nicely done!

491
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,700
Now that you're flush with cash, you can buy some new cards from the shop.

492
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,020
Try buying this handsome devil.

493
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,080
What about the empress?

494
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,580
Who's that lovely lady?

495
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,380
I have three dollars.

496
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,560
I have three dollars though.

497
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,420
I don't want to buy that.

498
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,920
Jimbo insists.

499
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,880
This is one of the 150 jokers you can add to your run.

500
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,820
Every joker does something different.

501
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,980
Junk card.

502
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,220
Oh, I thought...

503
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,320
Oh, because I thought I started out with no money.

504
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,740
This one adds plus four molt to every hand you play.

505
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,040
Wow, be picky.

506
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,440
You can only carry five joker cards at a time.

507
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,180
Oh!

508
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,760
Enhances two selected cards to molt cards.

509
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,280
This tarot card is a consumable.

510
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,520
This one will enhance your playing cards.

511
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,100
Hold on to it.

512
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,320
You can carry up to two consumable cards with you at a time.

513
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,520
If you save up enough, you can buy a voucher.

514
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,180
Vouchers passively upgrade your run.

515
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,000
What?

516
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,040
I just beat Champion Victor from Lies of P while watching...

517
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,100
After fighting him all day.

518
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,100
Congratulations!

519
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,340
Vouchers are restocked after you defeat the boss blind.

520
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,880
Check out both of the booster packs.

521
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,420
They're full of goodies.

522
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,220
Buffoon.

523
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,400
Let's move on to the next round.

524
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,820
Okay.

525
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,480
Big Blo-BB.

526
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,180
That's if Big Boss lost both his eyes.

527
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,700
Not just one.

528
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,080
Oh

529
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,320
you Big Blind.

530
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,080
Selecting the Big Blind will earn some cash.

531
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,900
Or choose to skip it to get a tag.

532
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,720
Each tag has a unique effect.

533
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,120
He's just saying words.

534
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
What does that mean?

535
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,520
But keep an eye on the Boss Blind.

536
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,980
It has an ability you'll need to plan around.

537
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,720
Discards two random cards per hand play.

538
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,560
I discard two random cards?

539
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:21,760
If you beat it then the ante goes up and all blinds become harder.

540
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,880
Beat ante A to win.

541
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,620
Now choose your path.

542
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,120
Gives one dollar per... what?

543
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,240
Gives one dollar per unused discard this run.

544
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,280
We'll give you one dollar.

545
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,680
So it gives me a dollar?

546
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,460
It gives me a single dollar?

547
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,920
I think maybe I should try the Big Blind.

548
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,220
The hook is looking a little...

549
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,620
She's looking a little...

550
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,320
Nice.

551
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,680
Nice.

552
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,360
Okay, I'll try it.

553
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,250
When you get more cards, remember you can rearrange them.

554
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,010
Jokers trigger in order from left to right.

555
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,050
And make sure you use...

556
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,310
I don't even... What does this do?

557
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,550
Enhances two select cards to multiple cards.

558
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,130
So it makes the cards...

559
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,130
More multipliable?

560
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,210
Just gives you a bonus.

561
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:51,530
Okay.

562
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,470
Select up to two cards in your hand and press use on the tarot card to enhance them.

563
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,630
Select these guys.

564
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,550
And

565
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,980
then...

566
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,880
There is no...

567
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,960
Use.

568
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,180
Where does Among Us come into this?

569
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,260
Okay.

570
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,820
Oh gosh, I gotta look over these again.

571
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,920
Because you guys saw the flush.

572
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,420
I didn't see that at all.

573
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,620
Okay, flush is five cards.

574
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,820
Three of a kind and a pair is a full house.

575
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,320
I gotta remember the couple and the throuple.

576
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,540
The couple and the throuple.

577
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,980
It's a full house.

578
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,120
What's the song for the full house?

579
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,140
What's the song for the full house?

580
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I never watched that show.

581
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,260
Thanks for the gift in!

582
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Thank you guys!

583
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,680
Everywhere you look.

584
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,940
Everywhere you go.

585
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,700
There's always a mean girl.

586
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,580
Everywhere you look.

587
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,940
Everywhere you go.

588
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,340
You can't escape.

589
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,050
Okay.

590
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,290
Four of a kind, that's easy.

591
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,070
Straight flush is easy.

592
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,870
Straight is easy.

593
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,010
Three of a kind is easy.

594
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,190
Two pair, easy.

595
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,750
Pair, easy.

596
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,030
High card, sure.

597
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,550
Wait, high card?

598
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,910
Only the highest ranked card scores.

599
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,690
So it's just like, hey, I'm an ace.

600
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,290
Straight is easy?

601
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,550
Yeah, to remember.

602
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,590
It's just five cards in a row.

603
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,630
Consecutive ranks.

604
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,970
I'm not saying it's easy to get.

605
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,890
I'm saying it's easy to remember.

606
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:21,830
Two!

607
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,530
Wait, okay, hold on.

608
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,050
Three of a kind, a pair.

609
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:36,970
I wish we had four of a kind and then a random guy.

610
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,770
That would be fun.

611
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:50,410
It's like, hi, we're so... I mean, we're four in consecutive and then we added this guy just for the fun of it.

612
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,760
And then Joker.

613
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,760
Do I pull him or do I always have him?

614
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,530
Wild card, okay.

615
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,410
I'm going to...

616
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,720
Discard this two.

617
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,700
He's always there, okay.

618
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,990
Wanted to try and get a six and maybe an eight.

619
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,030
I don't know.

620
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,670
One, two, three.

621
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,830
Oh wait, it's a...

622
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,430
Straight is five card.

623
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,230
Five.

624
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,890
No, straight is five.

625
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,650
One, two, three, four.

626
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,950
And then one, two, three.

627
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,250
Ace is one.

628
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,850
But what does that have to do with it?

629
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,470
With a straight.

630
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,570
When it's five cards.

631
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,590
Wait.

632
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,090
I still don't have a straight though.

633
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,870
Because it would be one.

634
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,630
I don't have a two.

635
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,770
I don't have two.

636
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,830
I didn't discard a two.

637
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,290
I discarded three.

638
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,010
I had two threes.

639
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,210
And it was like another one.

640
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,980
You guys are...

641
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,980
Go away.

642
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,260
You're being bad.

643
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,200
I banish you.

644
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,080
I banish you.

645
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,120
I don't look anymore.

646
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,200
You've lost all your privileges.

647
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,570
Actually.

648
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:50,710
Actually.

649
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,650
Let's see who the real people are.

650
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,910
What do you mean?

651
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,430
Anyway, I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

652
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,630
I don't know anymore.

653
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,450
I'm just gonna...

654
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,910
I don't know.

655
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,160
Stop it!

656
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,320
No!

657
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,260
I'm scared.

658
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,240
I'm scared to do anything.

659
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,460
This is why I don't play card games.

660
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,620
Except blackjack.

661
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,500
I like blackjack.

662
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,690
I don't know how this game works so no elf.

663
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,130
Me neither.

664
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,190
Okay, I'll bring you guys back.

665
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,450
I'm still not looking at chat.

666
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,830
Why am I getting bugged?

667
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,450
Don't attack the super!

668
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,310
Wait, the straight is...

669
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,570
Not the... No.

670
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:08,670
Flush.

671
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,650
There's five cards.

672
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:28,350
I think I might get rid of these and try for flush.

673
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,560
But I'll keep the elves.

674
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,360
Because it's hot.

675
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,900
I think.

676
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:37,980
Maybe.

677
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,780
You son of a bitch.

678
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,340
1, 2, 3, 4!

679
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,530
I don't want to get rid of this guy because we put the multiplier on him.

680
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,950
What do I do?

681
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,470
I'm gonna have no more discards at this point.

682
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:19,890
Or get a 10.

683
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,670
Oh, because of this?

684
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,470
Yeah, because 11...

685
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,570
1, 2, 3, 4.

686
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,370
Oh, it would be big money, right?

687
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,110
Wait, what is it?

688
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,470
The straight...

689
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,890
But flush is more points.

690
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,410
Yeah, it's technically more points.

691
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,610
Then a straight.

692
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,710
I think going for the flush is smarter than going for the straight.

693
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,830
I.M.H.O.

694
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,950
Get rid of the ace.

695
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,490
Guys, do I get rid of the ace?

696
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,410
Oh, but then...

697
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,740
Hold on.

698
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,740
We are doing spades, so...

699
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,240
If I go for the flush...

700
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,180
Let's go for the flush.

701
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,200
I made up my mind.

702
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,180
I made up my mind!

703
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

704
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,060
One hand baby!

705
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:00,460
Three!

706
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,130
Thank you!

707
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,440
I want to gamble.

708
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:21,380
Choose one of up to three tarot cards to be used immediately.

709
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,440
Oh wait, where did my bozo pack go?

710
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,000
Reroll costs money.

711
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,440
Converts up to three selected cards to hearts.

712
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,260
That could be good.

713
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,220
Level up two pair.

714
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Wait, level up two pair.

715
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,080
Plus one multiplier and 20 chips.

716
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,570
So it just adds more 20 chips?

717
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,590
I think this one is better.

718
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,860
Makes a two pair hand better.

719
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,780
Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, I get it, I understand now.

720
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,260
Ah, I see, I see, I thought I meant...

721
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:20,880
Okay, okay, okay.

722
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,100
Well, we can get both.

723
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:29,760
Buy...

724
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,100
Wait, buy and use?

725
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,560
What if I just buy it?

726
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,140
What does a buy and use mean?

727
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,920
Does it like immediately put it into my...

728
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,140
Thing?

729
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,790
It applies it right away.

730
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,060
Is this permanent?

731
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,240
Is this permanent?

732
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:17,960
Yes?

733
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,260
Oh, for this run.

734
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:20,600
Oh.

735
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:21,740
Boo!

736
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,980
Boo!

737
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,720
Okay.

738
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,740
Okay, okay.

739
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,900
This is the boss, right?

740
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,840
I'm scared.

741
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,260
Oh, but...

742
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,120
Oh, big blind!

743
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,630
The hook.

744
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,110
Discards two random cards per hand played.

745
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,790
Wait,

746
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,340
I have to get rid of them now?

747
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,260
Oh, this guy is back.

748
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,020
Oh,

749
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,460
I could do a flush.

750
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,720
1, 2, 3, 4...

751
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,800
What if I made him into a heart?

752
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,740
And then it would be the multiplier.

753
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,240
And I can make the king also.

754
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,380
Use?

755
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,000
Oh, wait.

756
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,100
Wait, 1, 2...

757
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,180
I have a question.

758
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,320
I have a question.

759
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,880
So, for flush...

760
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,180
Five cards in the same unit.

761
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,860
Do you get extra money if, say, like see for this.

762
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,720
It's an ace and a king and a ten.

763
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,720
If it was like a one and a two and a three...

764
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,480
Does that...

765
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,900
Does that...

766
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,040
Make it more money?

767
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,720
Yes, it's more points.

768
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,040
Okay.

769
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:09,880
Thank you.

770
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,160
I said no help unless I ask.

771
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,480
So if I change these two, then it will be more money.

772
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,220
What?

773
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,200
The higher the card, the more chips they add.

774
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:26,580
Okay.

775
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

776
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:48,550
I wanted to use this multiplier because what if they threw it away, you know?

777
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,620
Maybe I'm too good at this game.

778
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,660
This joker gains...

779
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,140
0...

780
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,100
0.025 multiplier for each card sold.

781
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,980
Resets when boss blind is defeated.

782
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:35,680
This joker gains plus one multiplier per consecutive hand played without scoring face card.

783
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,760
What's a voucher?

784
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,240
Oh.

785
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,240
I have enough.

786
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,920
The bus?

787
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,740
The bus is good.

788
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,790
So face card is a jack, queen, king?

789
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,340
Can someone explain this to me like I'm a Vtuber?

790
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,380
It

791
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,400
gets stronger if you don't play face cards.

792
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,200
Tiara, my man.

793
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,100
Thank you.

794
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,740
If you don't play fancy cards.

795
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,140
If you don't score face cards.

796
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,000
Imagine if Minto was a Vtuber.

797
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,480
Resets if you place a face card though.

798
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,460
And what are these packs?

799
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,620
I'm so curious.

800
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,860
I want to know what's inside.

801
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,820
I want to know.

802
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,470
But they are just standard packs.

803
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,710
I miss the Bozo one.

804
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,590
Thanks for the solitaire stream.

805
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:22,550
Here we go!

806
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,770
Gold card.

807
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,350
Six of spades.

808
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,890
Plus six chips.

809
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:43,590
Three dollars if this card is held in your hand at the end of the round.

810
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,130
Plus nine chips.

811
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,710
Plus eleven chips.

812
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,630
Plus thirty extra chips.

813
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,020
I feel a gold card is...

814
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,260
Fancy.

815
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,820
I just have to get this card and then hold on to it.

816
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,220
But what if I want to use it?

817
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,880
That would be so sad.

818
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,790
Do not take the nine.

819
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,330
Don't tell me what to do!

820
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,930
Multiply your supers if you don't play the Flesh Tuber card.

821
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:51,970
That's it!

822
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,740
I guess we'll go for the six.

823
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,920
People kept saying about the bus.

824
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,820
I guess I'll buy it.

825
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,120
The bus.

826
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,860
I have one dollar.

827
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,200
What's this?

828
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,680
Upgrade Flesh by three levels.

829
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,220
My toilet?

830
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,840
Wait!

831
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,800
How long?

832
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,960
Wait, so if I lose, I lose everything?

833
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,660
Oh my god.

834
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:45,780
Oh my god.

835
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,620
If I lose, I lose everything?

836
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,200
Till game over.

837
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,360
Oh my god.

838
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,020
This game is confusing me.

839
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,740
It's a roguelike.

840
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,580
Oh my god.

841
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,920
This is kind of... Upgrade the Flesh by three levels.

842
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,280
That seems kind of big.

843
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,080
That seems kind of big, right?

844
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,300
Green.

845
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,180
Angel, thanks for the gift.

846
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,100
I'm

847
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:31,090
gonna not do it just because you said three levels is poggers.

848
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:42,890
One, two, three, four, five.

849
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,010
Look at that.

850
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,670
Wait, so...

851
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,390
How do I use this?

852
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,390
If I like...

853
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,350
Like I...

854
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,030
Oh, it's automatic?

855
00:59:58,510 --> 00:59:59,370
Oh, it's passive.

856
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,290
Oh, okay.

857
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:02,950
This one wasn't passive though, was it?

858
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,830
I can't remember how I used it.

859
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,260
It was?

860
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,360
But it told me to pick the cards.

861
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,000
Seven, six, five, four.

862
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,080
So...

863
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,500
Oh,

864
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,500
I have four.

865
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,140
One, two, three, four, five.

866
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,540
Yeah, I guess this works.

867
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,900
Doesn't really matter.

868
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:32,800
Maybe.

869
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:41,480
Okay.

870
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,500
You know what's also big?

871
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,360
My P-Pair.

872
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:59,660
Which at high levels can score higher than a four of a kind or straight Flesh.

873
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,280
I hope you're feeling better, Minky.

874
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,240
Thank you.

875
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,380
Glad you liked the lore video.

876
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,800
Okay, where are we at now?

877
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,950
I have two pairs.

878
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,310
But if I use...

879
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:28,550
Stinky...

880
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,450
Stinky faceless men.

881
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,490
Stinky jacks.

882
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:38,230
I don't get my multiplier if I have you here.

883
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:42,490
Play the jacks out of spite.

884
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,580
Trying to figure out what I want to make with these.

885
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,580
Because we have like a setup for something.

886
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,620
Something around there, maybe.

887
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,200
If you play a face, the bus ride stops.

888
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,000
No, bus driver.

889
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,240
Thank you, bus driver.

890
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,500
Why did you guys tell me to get this?

891
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,980
These are the big money.

892
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,440
The gold six, true.

893
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,220
Let's get rid of these guys.

894
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,400
Goodbye.

895
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,860
I

896
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,900
didn't even buy the gold six.

897
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,800
I bought the ace.

898
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,180
Muffin is a faceless jack.

899
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,900
Do I just get rid of him again?

900
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,370
Magic spell for passing kidney stones.

901
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:15,150
Go ride Thunder Mountain at Disney's...

902
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,350
Disney Park.

903
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,550
Goodbye.

904
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:39,930
I'm just going to do this.

905
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:41,490
I think.

906
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:44,550
I don't even know what I'm trying to make.

907
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:48,710
I might throw away the three at that point then too.

908
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:52,010
Play.

909
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:52,090
Play.

910
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:03,630
I

911
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,030
don't realize how much you get from these points.

912
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,590
Until it happens.

913
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:23,550
Five bucks, let's go.

914
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,070
Let's go.

915
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:33,110
Plus twelve multiplier if played hand contains a straight.

916
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:34,450
Little bean.

917
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,030
Plus five hand size.

918
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:39,670
Reduces by one every round.

919
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,700
So I would start out with five extra cards.

920
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,340
Is what that means.

921
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:01,690
But it decays.

922
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:05,530
I feel

923
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,260
like this one is way too specific, right?

924
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,600
I don't have to buy anything.

925
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,490
It doesn't decay fast.

926
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,170
They are kind of meh.

927
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,310
I'm seeing people are split on the bean.

928
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:39,190
People are...all bean opposers raise your hand.

929
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:45,430
All bean...all bean...all bean...opposers raise your hand.

930
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,570
I'd say that's the majority.

931
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:02,950
Next round!

932
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,810
What do we get?

933
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:08,170
Mega Arcana pack!

934
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,150
That sounds exciting.

935
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:17,230
Choose two of up to five tarot cards to be used immediately.

936
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,610
Mega Arcana!

937
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:31,190
Get money.

938
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:39,910
Is it possible to beat this game without any upgrades?

939
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,770
Like in the tougher levels?

940
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:45,250
I feel like not really, right?

941
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,170
How far have you gotten?

942
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,230
I'm just going to play it.

943
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,230
Because I'm still learning and I want to do as many rounds as I can to learn.

944
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,390
How many levels...how far have you gotten?

945
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,480
There is a joker-less thing.

946
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,480
Joker-less run.

947
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,120
People are true masochists, I swear.

948
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:15,330
Goodbye family!

949
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,030
I'm murdering this entire...

950
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:17,950
Wait, oh my gosh.

951
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:24,850
If I get a ten...of hearts?

952
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,030
If I get a ten of hearts...

953
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:38,730
Wait, when would the bus come back?

954
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,250
When would the bus come back?

955
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:45,670
It's better than the bus.

956
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,590
Right?

957
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,020
If only I had bought that other joker.

958
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,620
Wait, would that be a straight?

959
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,920
Which is that?

960
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,240
Straight?

961
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,640
Straight flush?

962
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,000
Welcome to the addiction.

963
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:04,860
Thanks.

964
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,740
Yeah, I could sell it.

965
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:13,120
True.

966
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,920
I could sell it and then it wouldn't just disappear.

967
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,300
I would get money for it.

968
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,820
I feel like it's worth it.

969
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,160
Like I can sell all four of these cards.

970
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,020
It doesn't disappear.

971
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, it doesn't vanish?

972
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:33,060
Oh, it just stops working for...

973
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,490
It just resets.

974
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,110
I'm selling these.

975
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:41,870
Discard!

976
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:42,970
I got it.

977
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,290
Oh!

978
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:01,630
Holy shit!

979
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,690
I played a royal flush!

980
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,750
I got an achievement!

981
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,500
I told you guys!

982
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,480
I told you guys!

983
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:20,880
I told you guys!

984
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,260
We have icy...Oh my gosh!

985
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,820
Ice Joker!

986
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:27,340
Ice Joker!

987
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:35,020
Plus two chips for each remaining card in deck.

988
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,520
Ice Joker.

989
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,040
Or...

990
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,780
This joker gains plus three multiplier when any booster pack is skipped.

991
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,180
Like if I don't buy this?

992
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,800
Spectra, that's mean!

993
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,140
Choose two of up to four spectral cards.

994
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,300
If you buy and skip...Wait, what?

995
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,100
Oh, if you buy it...What?

996
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,060
That's so evil.

997
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,060
So you have to buy?

998
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:22,600
You have to buy the pack and then just be like, nah, this sucks and just skip it?

999
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,120
This bus sucks.

1000
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:36,840
No help is only when I don't ask for help.

1001
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:41,080
But if I ask questions, if I don't understand something, then of course help is okay.

1002
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,420
But if you're like, VTuber!

1003
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,980
You should play the jack instead!

1004
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,640
Then that's...This is choose one of up to five tarot cards.

1005
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,020
Choose two of the spectral cards.

1006
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,400
What's a spectral...We don't even know what that is!

1007
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,400
Why did this play?

1008
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,500
What's happening?

1009
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,750
Let me off this bus!

1010
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:17,010
Grim.

1011
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:19,850
Destroy one random card in your hand.

1012
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,170
Add two random enhanced aces to your hand.

1013
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:31,990
Add foil holographic or polychrome effect to one selected card in hand.

1014
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:37,450
Fifty chips plus ten multiplier.

1015
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:38,310
That's huge!

1016
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,350
Oh my god.

1017
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:41,890
Aura.

1018
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,210
Hex.

1019
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,950
Add polychrome to a random joker.

1020
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,590
Destroys all other jokers.

1021
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:50,210
I only have one.

1022
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,090
Oh wait, no, just kidding.

1023
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,350
I'm an idiot.

1024
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:06,470
Converts all cards in hand to a single random rank minus one hand size.

1025
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:09,450
What?

1026
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:17,010
Oh, if I sell the bus and do this...

1027
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:22,370
It would be plus four and then 1.5?

1028
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:24,290
I can choose two.

1029
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,700
I think I'm gonna choose the aura one for sure.

1030
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,280
But then...

1031
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,500
Oh, I see how it reset.

1032
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,080
I see.

1033
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,500
I understand now.

1034
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,460
Welcome to membership.

1035
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,180
Thank you.

1036
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,250
Converts all cards to a random rank?

1037
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,310
Wait, so they would all be the same number?

1038
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,250
You get that.

1039
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,630
Why is it showing these?

1040
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:15,230
I'm so confused.

1041
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,620
Oh, so I can like put it on the ace.

1042
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,320
That would be huge actually.

1043
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,640
That would be huge.

1044
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,720
Putting it on the ace would be really good.

1045
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,540
What is it?

1046
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,400
Foil.

1047
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,110
So it's only in my hand.

1048
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:10,650
I'm so confused.

1049
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,690
Kill the bus.

1050
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,910
It might be time to kill the bus.

1051
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:22,430
But I can also get... Wait, I can get two random enhanced aces.

1052
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:24,830
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second...

1053
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:32,550
If I do the aces, I would get two more aces.

1054
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:33,650
And then...

1055
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:36,650
And then if I just...

1056
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:43,990
It could destroy your ace.

1057
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,730
Oh, it couldn't.

1058
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:47,950
We'd have to take the gamble.

1059
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,730
We'd have to take the gamble.

1060
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:58,510
How would I get... How would I get...

1061
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:03,690
Look at that guy.

1062
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:04,450
Wait.

1063
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,670
If I pulled him then... Wait.

1064
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:16,310
If I got the two enhanced and then I pulled another ace, I could get the... Wait, isn't it four of a kind?

1065
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:18,150
Yeah, four of a kind.

1066
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:19,510
I could get the four of a kind.

1067
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,090
If I pulled one more.

1068
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,700
You could make five of a kind.

1069
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,780
I have a lot of aces.

1070
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,060
One, two, three, four, five.

1071
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:41,580
I could.

1072
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,880
Should I try it?

1073
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,260
You guys, should I try it?

1074
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:49,920
Do we risk?

1075
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,860
Do we gamble?

1076
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,600
Do we gamble?

1077
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,140
Let's go gambling!

1078
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,980
That was so close.

1079
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:13,180
That

1080
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,340
was so close.

1081
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,520
I have six dollars left.

1082
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,580
Should I... I have a question.

1083
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,880
What do chips do?

1084
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,040
I have 108 of them.

1085
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,340
What do they do?

1086
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,140
How do I use them?

1087
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,360
That's your score.

1088
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,520
Actual points.

1089
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,750
So, this would be good then, right?

1090
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:05,370
To have.

1091
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,510
Technically.

1092
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,880
Okay, I'll buy it.

1093
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,080
Alright, let's go.

1094
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:17,740
Next round.

1095
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,580
And it's the big boss.

1096
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,020
The window.

1097
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,200
All diamond cards are debuffed.

1098
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,320
I don't have any of that, right?

1099
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,140
Oh, diamond.

1100
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:34,360
I'm sorry.

1101
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,060
I was thinking like a foil card.

1102
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:36,580
I was like...

1103
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,520
Oh, you can get cards that are like diamond.

1104
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,100
Where

1105
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:50,010
did my other aces go?

1106
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:02,310
I thought they were in my hand.

1107
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:05,990
Oh, you still have to draw them.

1108
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:06,370
Okay.

1109
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:07,470
Alright, guys.

1110
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,820
I think I just throw everything away.

1111
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,700
I think I just throw everything away.

1112
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,880
I just go for...

1113
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,780
I just go for the big ones.

1114
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,180
Wait, let me keep that.

1115
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,360
Let's go for the big ones.

1116
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:52,310
Potential heart flush.

1117
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:54,790
I know, that's why I'm like...

1118
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,530
That's why I'm...

1119
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:03,370
I'm calculating.

1120
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,470
I'm calculating.

1121
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,530
I think... ALL IN!

1122
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,810
But it would still, even if it's...

1123
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:28,190
Even if it's debuffed, it would still work, right?

1124
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:33,130
Wait.

1125
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:38,610
Full house.

1126
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:39,290
What's this one?

1127
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:39,890
What's a full house?

1128
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:41,610
Three of a kind and a pair.

1129
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:47,650
Three of a kind and a pair.

1130
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,170
I mean, I could do this pair too.

1131
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:52,690
I don't have any multiplier on it, so...

1132
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,710
Do the 10s on the king.

1133
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:01,630
Just so that we can get the multiplier.

1134
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:04,030
Is it possible?

1135
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:26,600
Yeah!

1136
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,040
We got some funky looking things going on here.

1137
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,020
I never get any tarot cards.

1138
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,100
I don't understand what's going on in this game, but I appreciate the minter noise.

1139
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,640
I don't know what's going on either.

1140
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,700
If first hand of round is a single six...

1141
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,900
Destroy it and create a spectral card.

1142
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,200
Must have room.

1143
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,120
What?

1144
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,210
Everybody is screaming about DNA.

1145
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,890
Hold on guys, let me read it.

1146
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:34,230
If first hand of round has only one card...

1147
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:38,810
Add a permanent copy to deck and draw it to hand.

1148
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:39,650
What?

1149
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:41,270
This is rare.

1150
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:44,610
Jack, thanks for the ping.

1151
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,420
I don't understand.

1152
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,940
You can use it to copy cards.

1153
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:12,850
You play one card and you copy it and then you put it...

1154
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,420
And then it would put it in my deck and then I would draw it.

1155
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,160
I would draw it immediately.

1156
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,050
What's a celestial pack?

1157
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,530
Three planet cards.

1158
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:42,570
Yes, I'll try it.

1159
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,910
How many of these can I have?

1160
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,330
Oh, out of five.

1161
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:45,910
Just kidding.

1162
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,870
I see, I can read.

1163
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,740
It's a free spectral pack.

1164
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,540
I'm saving money.

1165
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,840
He's like, hey, use me.

1166
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,520
Use me.

1167
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:08,760
Use me.

1168
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,180
Use me.

1169
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,660
Look at them, he's boss.

1170
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,660
He's like, I can't stop looking up there.

1171
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,680
I have like...

1172
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,040
One, two, three, four... I have a straight.

1173
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,520
I have a straight.

1174
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,000
If only this...

1175
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,660
If only...

1176
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:48,980
If I...

1177
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,660
So it says like first hand of round.

1178
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,660
So if I discard anything...

1179
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,760
Yeah, obviously that would be a new hand then, right?

1180
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:00,760
Oh,

1181
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,580
discards don't count.

1182
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:11,840
So if I discard this ten and this six to try and maybe get...

1183
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:16,300
Oh, and the king to try and maybe get one and ace and two?

1184
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,320
Maybe...

1185
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,680
Part nine.

1186
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,040
OK, let's try it.

1187
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:28,960
Discard.

1188
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:29,680
Ace!

1189
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,560
I

1190
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,980
think that almost got me enough to win.

1191
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,460
Oh, it's gone.

1192
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,720
Oh, only once per round.

1193
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:13,040
Oh yeah, you're so right.

1194
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:14,260
Anyway...

1195
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,260
We can still do this.

1196
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,080
We can still do this.

1197
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:27,560
We can still do this.

1198
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,400
It doesn't matter which one.

1199
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,400
Get rid of the red.

1200
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,840
We can still do this.

1201
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:39,840
I want the big money.

1202
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,360
I want the big money.

1203
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:49,370
Aw, shucks.

1204
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,010
We can get an extra chips though.

1205
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:57,840
No, I can't.

1206
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,880
That's five cards.

1207
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,040
Anyway...

1208
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:14,400
Yeah!

1209
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:23,510
OK.

1210
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:29,270
Wait, you get more money the less cards you play and not the higher your score is or is it both?

1211
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:35,740
You make money by having hands left over.

1212
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,800
The more hands left.

1213
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,800
Oh, it's not your score then?

1214
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,500
Oh, OK.

1215
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:47,740
I'll remember that.

1216
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:52,020
Plus a multiplier if player hand contains a pair.

1217
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:56,980
Plus 30 chips for each remaining discard.

1218
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:00,740
Oh, discard.

1219
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,100
Oh...

1220
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,700
I don't have enough for this one.

1221
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,860
Hey guys, I don't have enough for it.

1222
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,700
I have no money.

1223
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:21,650
I could buy an Arcana pack.

1224
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:23,270
I could sell a jaunt.

1225
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,490
Yeah, I could sell one.

1226
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,240
Um...

1227
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,180
Jam, welcome to the membership.

1228
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,080
Thank you.

1229
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,540
No, I don't want to sell my bus.

1230
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,220
I like my bus.

1231
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,100
It's been helping me out.

1232
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,660
I've gotten this far.

1233
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,060
The bus...my bus pass is insane.

1234
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:55,520
My bus...my bus...

1235
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,840
My bus!

1236
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,560
Thank you bus driver.

1237
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,300
Wait, why is it saying negative right there?

1238
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,100
Plus one Joker slot.

1239
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,600
Wait, that's a bad part?

1240
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:21,160
It adds a Joker slot so I would be able to maybe buy the bus back eventually?

1241
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:28,340
We could sell the bus and get it again someday.

1242
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,460
One day!

1243
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,600
Hand contain a pair.

1244
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,000
That's so specific.

1245
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,700
Thanks for staying gifted.

1246
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:57,680
Look we are at plus four multiplier.

1247
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,680
I'm keeping it.

1248
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,580
Whatever.

1249
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,180
Whatever.

1250
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:05,540
Next round.

1251
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,960
What do we get?

1252
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,500
Mega standard pack.

1253
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,500
I'll

1254
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:36,590
get rid of these and we'll just keep these for now.

1255
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:46,210
If I get a nine...

1256
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:54,150
But my ace.

1257
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,680
Fish ace.

1258
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,160
I actually don't really understand this one.

1259
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,900
Legendary Joker in the bottom corner.

1260
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:53,940
Wait, so I just can then play the same thing?

1261
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,540
Oh, but then I have it for the next round, right?

1262
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,620
Ok, wait, hold on.

1263
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:08,080
What's better?

1264
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:09,740
A straight or...

1265
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:11,080
I don't have a full hat.

1266
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:11,380
Wait.

1267
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,240
Three of a kind and a pair.

1268
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,980
I don't have that, do I?

1269
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,820
I need to keep remembering that's a thing because I feel like that one is pretty good.

1270
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,260
But I think this should be enough.

1271
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:25,900
Maybe?

1272
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,960
Our multiplier is kind of crazy.

1273
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,900
You're creating new aces.

1274
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:44,000
Oh, so if I then play it next round it will...

1275
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:48,080
Should I pull for a better ace?

1276
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,720
Maybe it will get a better ace in all...

1277
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,140
Oh no, Junkler.

1278
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,480
Ace babies.

1279
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,520
That was your best ace?

1280
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,040
Really?

1281
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:04,760
You think so?

1282
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,520
I feel like I have better aces.

1283
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:12,820
Like this one, right?

1284
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:13,780
Wait, what is this?

1285
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,320
It's just... Oh, plus 50.

1286
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:15,880
Just kidding.

1287
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,600
It is my best.

1288
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:17,000
You're right.

1289
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,340
You're right.

1290
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:20,180
It is my best.

1291
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:24,880
Level up three of a kind.

1292
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,780
Oh, wow, it's a tarot card.

1293
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,040
Plus 2 multiplier plus 20 chip.

1294
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,620
Three of a kind.

1295
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,460
I can pay for that.

1296
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:46,590
Oh, planet.

1297
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:47,850
Yeah, sorry.

1298
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,020
One in two chances to create a tarot card when any booster pack is opened.

1299
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:05,600
No!

1300
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,300
Try an Arcana pack.

1301
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,660
We can do the one of one.

1302
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:16,260
Choose one of up to three tarot cards to be used immediately.

1303
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:20,480
Choose two of up to five tarot cards to be used immediately.

1304
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:27,950
Yeah, the voucher.

1305
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:30,250
I don't want to use this one.

1306
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:34,310
This one is fine, but I want to see others.

1307
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,690
We have four dollars left.

1308
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:48,500
What if we get another good card and I can't...

1309
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:49,590
OK.

1310
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:51,490
Open.

1311
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,530
World.

1312
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:03,290
Converts up to three selected cards to spades.

1313
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:10,510
Oh, three dollars of this card is held in hand at the end of round.

1314
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:14,670
Oh, selects... Enhances one selected card into a gold card.

1315
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:15,430
OK, hold on.

1316
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:15,790
Let me read.

1317
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:18,350
Converts up to three selected cards to spades.

1318
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:23,160
OK.

1319
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:23,300
OK.

1320
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,520
Enhances two selected cards to multicards.

1321
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:31,720
OK.

1322
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,120
Oh, we had the Empress before.

1323
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:37,820
I didn't realize that these, like, buffs were permanent.

1324
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,200
Thanks for the stream!

1325
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:46,060
Also, your jokers trigger left to right, so it might be worth reordering them.

1326
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,340
Yeah, permanent to the run.

1327
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,320
Hell yeah, that's what I meant.

1328
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,040
Chariot.

1329
01:34:57,380 --> 01:35:01,240
Enhances one selected card into a steel card.

1330
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,860
1.5 card while this card stays in their hand.

1331
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,060
Doubles money!

1332
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:23,430
OK.

1333
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:27,050
Now one more.

1334
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:50,990
Doubles money earned.

1335
01:35:56,170 --> 01:35:57,850
I see.

1336
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:13,290
OK,

1337
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:19,940
anyway.

1338
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,560
Let's see.

1339
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,360
So, 1.5 multiplier while this card stays in your hand.

1340
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,040
OK.

1341
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,860
Hear me out.

1342
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:33,620
Wait.

1343
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,560
Hear me out!

1344
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:36,740
The Ace.

1345
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,360
We then...

1346
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,620
We then...

1347
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,080
Multiply.

1348
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:45,620
We then... We then dupe it.

1349
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,660
And then we will hold on to it.

1350
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:56,580
Right?

1351
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:57,380
Maybe... Wait.

1352
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:06,150
It's a great strategy?

1353
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:09,590
Maybe?

1354
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:11,390
We can try it.

1355
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:12,070
Why not?

1356
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:13,730
Let's try it.

1357
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:25,400
Anyway, let's go to the next round.

1358
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,420
All heart cards are debuffed!

1359
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:29,820
The head!

1360
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:30,380
OK.

1361
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:32,740
I'm scared.

1362
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:34,900
Oh, I forgot to rearrange it.

1363
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:46,130
My Aces are hearts.

1364
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:55,650
You can move your jokers at any time.

1365
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:00,670
So if I like... Let's see.

1366
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:05,650
Does it matter actually?

1367
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:07,390
I don't think so.

1368
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:15,980
I got a flush.

1369
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:16,720
What's a flush again?

1370
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,920
Oh, five cards share the same unit.

1371
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,200
That's so fucked up!

1372
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,840
That's so messed up!

1373
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,580
OK, let me just... Let me just play this.

1374
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:39,010
That's so messed up!

1375
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:40,530
Goodbye!

1376
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:41,250
Goodbye!

1377
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:41,790
Goodbye!

1378
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,410
Goodbye.

1379
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:46,230
That's so messed up.

1380
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,180
Get five of a kind.

1381
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:25,420
We can try.

1382
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,720
Full house is three of a kind and a pair.

1383
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:30,820
Yeah, we do have a three of a kind and a pair, but...

1384
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:34,900
Full house.

1385
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:38,780
Guys, it's not looking so good.

1386
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,760
Guys, it's not looking so good.

1387
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:47,660
Guys, but we still have our pair!

1388
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,360
We can do the three of a kind and a pair, right?

1389
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,620
That's the full house.

1390
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,080
It's OK.

1391
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,000
It's OK.

1392
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:57,980
We still got the full house.

1393
01:39:58,520 --> 01:39:59,180
It's OK.

1394
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:14,990
I reached anti-four.

1395
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:19,810
Hang a

1396
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:25,580
bit.

1397
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,180
Slowly but surely.

1398
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,820
Just finished orientation for my new job.

1399
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,340
Otsu!

1400
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,220
Level up straight.

1401
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,320
Plus three multiplier...

1402
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,060
Oh, it's another planet.

1403
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:43,120
Retrigger all played cards in final hand of round.

1404
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,340
What does that mean?

1405
01:40:51,970 --> 01:40:53,630
Plus one hand size.

1406
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:57,470
That's kind of huge though, right?

1407
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:02,610
Oh, cards will score twice.

1408
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:03,810
Final hand will score twice.

1409
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:11,070
I think I'm going to get this one though.

1410
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:17,580
Paintbrush.

1411
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:26,870
So, would this...

1412
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:29,090
I guess... OK, wait.

1413
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:32,570
If it's a final round though, wouldn't that imply...

1414
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:34,610
Oh, so it's like...

1415
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:40,010
If I say I have the hands and I'm on the final hand.

1416
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:41,270
The last hand.

1417
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:43,610
It's not like if I...

1418
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:46,010
Like the hand to win, right?

1419
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:51,810
Only for your last hand.

1420
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:56,370
If you have one hand left.

1421
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,390
OK, OK, OK.

1422
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:00,890
That could be like a clutch and all.

1423
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:02,530
I feel like that could help.

1424
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:06,490
Last in the store.

1425
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:07,770
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1426
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:11,270
Survival Joker.

1427
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:13,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1428
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:14,290
Panic button.

1429
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:15,010
Yeah, yeah.

1430
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:15,890
It could be good.

1431
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:18,510
I feel we do have to be a little bit...

1432
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:21,770
A little bit exclusive.

1433
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:24,030
Since we have only one slot left.

1434
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:25,570
But I don't hate this.

1435
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:41,170
I could always sell it.

1436
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:41,550
True.

1437
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:43,550
But it doesn't sell for the same amount.

1438
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:45,490
It does?

1439
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,430
Or no?

1440
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:47,650
It sells for like half.

1441
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,970
It sells for half-ish.

1442
01:42:58,890 --> 01:42:59,730
I see.

1443
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:01,650
It sells for $2?

1444
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,170
That's not even half.

1445
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:06,330
Rip off, rip off, rip off, rip off.

1446
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:10,290
Why is the icon for this game Lord Farquaad?

1447
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:12,550
On my desktop.

1448
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:29,230
Not Jimbo.

1449
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,630
This is Jimbo, right?

1450
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:32,830
Look, look.

1451
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:33,430
Hold on.

1452
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,990
Windows Shift S.

1453
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,620
This is on my desktop.

1454
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,620
I just noticed it just now.

1455
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:57,900
Lord Farquaad.

1456
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:00,900
Have a virus.

1457
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:14,310
Where is our Shrek pack?

1458
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:16,170
Come on, Bilatro.

1459
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:16,910
Get on it.

1460
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:19,750
Come on, Bilatro.

1461
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:21,950
It's right there.

1462
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:23,550
OK, I'm just gonna go to the next round.

1463
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:28,790
Rerolls the boss blind.

1464
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,350
All club cards are debuffed.

1465
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:35,190
$10,000.

1466
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:36,950
OK.

1467
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,310
OK.

1468
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:50,240
Oh.

1469
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,020
Oh.

1470
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,460
I think I should hunt for a better one.

1471
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,660
Fish for better.

1472
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:09,080
I agree.

1473
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,460
Are we gonna keep this?

1474
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:14,460
Because we almost... We kind of have a little bit of a straight going on.

1475
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:17,020
But I don't think I should keep him, maybe.

1476
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:19,080
Grab plus 8 multiplier.

1477
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:21,620
ABD, always be discarded.

1478
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,820
Almost a flash?

1479
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:29,300
Really?

1480
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:33,620
1, 2, 3, 4.

1481
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:34,520
I see.

1482
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,180
Let's just get rid of these.

1483
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:38,460
Wait, which is better?

1484
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:38,820
Straight?

1485
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,900
Oh, flash is technically better.

1486
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,760
Maybe we should go by that instead then.

1487
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:45,880
Let's go for that instead.

1488
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:47,580
Discard!

1489
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:51,760
What the hell?

1490
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,740
What the hell?

1491
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:05,990
Guys, this isn't looking good.

1492
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:09,790
Guys, this isn't looking good.

1493
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:41,530
3, 4, 5.

1494
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:44,370
I'm gonna play our flush.

1495
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:56,610
Is that enough?

1496
01:46:58,910 --> 01:46:59,670
Close.

1497
01:47:19,070 --> 01:47:20,470
And last discard.

1498
01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:23,650
Yeah.

1499
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:28,370
The pear will do it, probably, but...

1500
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:03,380
It was on fire!

1501
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:09,700
I thought I would get an achievement for that.

1502
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:12,680
Happy Bellagio.

1503
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:13,660
Thank you!

1504
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:20,940
Now we just need to do that on...

1505
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,940
On the...

1506
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:26,610
The boss.

1507
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,080
Money on sale.

1508
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,600
Yeah, actually.

1509
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:36,860
Let's see.

1510
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:38,660
Played...

1511
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,160
Sorry dealer, 5 aces.

1512
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:41,040
Read them in wheat.

1513
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,720
I can't believe that just happened.

1514
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:52,840
Playing cards with heart suit will give plus 3 multiplier when scored.

1515
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:53,500
Okay.

1516
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:59,180
He's all here for Valentine's Day.

1517
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:02,040
Let's do the hermit.

1518
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,420
Buy and use.

1519
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,660
We got more money.

1520
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:12,090
We got more money.

1521
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:14,170
The bozo pack!

1522
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:17,870
Choose one of up to two joker cards.

1523
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:23,090
What is the...

1524
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,950
Joker card?

1525
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:26,570
Should we try it?

1526
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:29,130
Should we do the bozo?

1527
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:33,550
Yeah, let's do it.

1528
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:35,590
Let's try the bozo pack.

1529
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:43,030
Plus 10 multiplier if played hand contains a flush.

1530
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:49,850
This joker gains plus 3 chips per discarded diamond card.

1531
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:52,930
Suit changes every round.

1532
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:57,050
Oh...

1533
01:49:57,770 --> 01:50:00,270
Green tea, welcome to Mambo Shop!

1534
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:12,660
Castle isn't bad.

1535
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:17,340
Yeah, I do discard a lot.

1536
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,280
Castle could be good and it changes so it doesn't have to be the same card every time.

1537
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:24,400
I'm always just throwing stuff away.

1538
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:27,220
I'm always just like, yeah, get out of here.

1539
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,580
Let's try it.

1540
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:35,320
If we don't like it, we sell it later.

1541
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:35,700
I don't know.

1542
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,260
Rerolls the boss blind.

1543
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,880
I'll club cards.

1544
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:49,950
Let's go.

1545
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,900
What if I...

1546
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,340
Try to get more aces.

1547
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:15,860
Yeah, now discard for all aces.

1548
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,180
Dang.

1549
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:20,260
I guess this is good to have when we don't ride the bus anymore.

1550
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,970
But since I'm riding the bus...

1551
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,720
Okay, what is this?

1552
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,740
Diamond card.

1553
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,380
I'm only throwing away one of those, but that's okay.

1554
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:36,170
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

1555
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:38,690
Upgrade!

1556
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:43,950
Shoot.

1557
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:47,590
Oh shoot.

1558
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,020
Hold on.

1559
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:57,820
One, two.

1560
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:58,760
Let's get rid of the people.

1561
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:00,140
Get rid of the people.

1562
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,460
Down with the...

1563
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,440
Should I try for five?

1564
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:31,940
Should I try for five?

1565
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:43,920
Everything is coming at me.

1566
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:51,900
I should have discarded these.

1567
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:52,680
I'm an idiot.

1568
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:53,780
That's okay though.

1569
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:59,300
Score 10,000 chips in a single hand.

1570
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:19,650
This joker gains 0.25 multiplier every time playing a card is added to your deck.

1571
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:21,310
Wait, what?

1572
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:24,510
Like...

1573
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:26,950
So...

1574
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:30,190
So with the DNA?

1575
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:33,050
Like that?

1576
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,380
Huge with DNA?

1577
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,460
It sounds like it.

1578
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:45,120
We have to sell someone though.

1579
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:45,760
Hold on.

1580
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,440
Earn $2 per discard.

1581
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:50,200
If no discards are used by the end of the round.

1582
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,400
No, but I used discards.

1583
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,200
No, no, no, no, no.

1584
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,820
No, no, no, no, no.

1585
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:00,440
Sell Jimbo!

1586
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:02,920
Him!

1587
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,140
Jimbo!

1588
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:09,000
Jimbo!

1589
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
He's been with me this whole time.

1590
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,920
Jimbo for holographic Jimbo.

1591
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,420
It's not the same.

1592
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,400
It's like having...

1593
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,760
It's like having...

1594
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:29,390
The Beatles playing on stage.

1595
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:31,070
It's not the same.

1596
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:42,540
He upgraded.

1597
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:45,520
Is this like Jimbo becoming a VTuber?

1598
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:50,440
Is it like he became a VTuber and now...

1599
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:53,180
Yeah?

1600
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:56,460
Okay.

1601
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,600
He sells for $1.

1602
01:54:59,020 --> 01:54:59,960
Nobody wants him.

1603
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,900
I thought he was gonna curse me.

1604
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,960
I'm not gonna lie.

1605
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:08,760
Hey, Jimbo.

1606
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:15,600
Wait, should I... Does order matter here?

1607
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,200
Should I put it like behind the DNA?

1608
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:20,920
All the way to the right?

1609
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,480
Okay, okay.

1610
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:24,040
Yeah, because then... Okay, okay, okay.

1611
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:29,120
Wow, there's so much to keep track of here.

1612
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:33,740
Choose one of up to five planet cards.

1613
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,460
Only one?

1614
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,360
Stingy.

1615
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:40,060
Should we do for... Go for a tarot card?

1616
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:48,340
Joker order should be chips, then multi-multi.

1617
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,660
I see.

1618
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,040
Well, this one doesn't really matter, I think.

1619
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:54,520
Right?

1620
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:57,480
I'll just... I'll put him there anyway.

1621
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,060
This is frozen Jimbo.

1622
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:08,100
Let's wait for a better... You guys, let's wait for a better Arcana pack.

1623
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:11,160
Let's wait for one where we can pull two, okay?

1624
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:14,960
Alright.

1625
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,400
It's boss time.

1626
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,380
Which one though?

1627
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:41,020
Which one do I...

1628
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:43,940
Steal?

1629
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:45,000
This is the steal?

1630
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:03,300
Okay.

1631
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,340
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

1632
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:10,800
Goodbye.

1633
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,080
Yeah, let's check every heart.

1634
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,940
It's okay though, it's okay.

1635
01:57:38,570 --> 01:57:40,810
We just need one more.

1636
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:45,890
Full house?

1637
01:57:46,190 --> 01:57:48,510
I can't remember what full house... Oh, three of a kind and a pair.

1638
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:50,570
No, no, let's go for four of a kind.

1639
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:52,130
Four of a kind, baby.

1640
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:55,350
Four of a kind!

1641
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:58,250
Ah, nice.

1642
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:04,190
I mean, we do have four of a kind, but we're trying to keep this in the hand, you know?

1643
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:08,490
We're trying to keep it, we're trying to keep it.

1644
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:09,510
Right?

1645
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:11,230
Does it... Wait, does it stay?

1646
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:13,850
Five of a kind.

1647
01:58:16,690 --> 01:58:17,410
Thank you!

1648
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:18,790
Thank you so much!

1649
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:23,090
Yeah, we want to keep it, we want to keep it.

1650
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:23,430
Right?

1651
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:27,750
Like, we want to play the four and then have this still in our hand, right?

1652
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:30,750
That's how the multiplier works.

1653
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,630
Right?

1654
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:36,050
Yeah.

1655
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,280
That's... That's what I'm talking about.

1656
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,920
Maybe we can still do five of a kind.

1657
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:51,480
Even though this one doesn't mean anything.

1658
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:54,580
We can still do it.

1659
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:59,900
One, two, three, four, five.

1660
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:29,980
Give me my money.

1661
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:33,460
What's our voucher?

1662
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,720
I'm guessing there's a...

1663
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:48,500
I'm guessing... I'm guessing there's an achievement for collecting all the vouchers.

1664
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,700
Oh, surprise tool for later.

1665
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:03,460
Destroys up to two selected cards.

1666
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:07,420
Okay.

1667
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,260
Level up straight flesh.

1668
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,080
Buffalo!

1669
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:18,380
Why is that one so shiny?

1670
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,460
Oh, they're both pretty shiny.

1671
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:19,960
Nevermind.

1672
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:27,540
Guys, what if I buy Pokemon cards and open them on stream?

1673
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,160
Hangman is quite useful.

1674
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,760
So I can just destroy whatever I want.

1675
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:43,600
That particular one you gotta buy 10 of to upgrade.

1676
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,360
What?

1677
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,860
RetroCandy, welcome to BibleShop.

1678
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,840
Thank you!

1679
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,000
Thins out your deck.

1680
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,840
So we can just have only aces.

1681
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,140
What if we get a boss that's just like...

1682
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:00,420
All aces are...

1683
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:03,140
All aces are...

1684
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:08,880
Are obsolete.

1685
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,680
Oh, I can get rid of some face cards.

1686
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:21,160
Someone said Pokemon cards.

1687
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:22,420
Alright,

1688
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,120
let's try it.

1689
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:33,340
Okay.

1690
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:39,790
But it doesn't count as like a discard.

1691
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,270
Okay, I understand now.

1692
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:46,190
Hold on to it.

1693
02:01:46,630 --> 02:01:47,090
Yes.

1694
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:49,150
We hold on to it.

1695
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:53,790
FatalShot, welcome to BambooShip.

1696
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:54,350
Thank you!

1697
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:55,930
Okay.

1698
02:01:57,910 --> 02:02:01,410
I think I'm good right now on my jokers, so...

1699
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:03,610
11,000!

1700
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:04,910
22!

1701
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:06,490
Oh my gosh.

1702
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:06,890
Okay.

1703
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:08,410
Wait.

1704
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:10,510
Gives us free spectral pack.

1705
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:12,030
I think I'm good.

1706
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:20,860
Nice!

1707
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:29,760
Hold on.

1708
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:30,540
What is our thing?

1709
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,080
Every heart card.

1710
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:32,840
Okay.

1711
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:38,140
Did you know that if you play cards, you might do something and that something might make you win?

1712
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:42,860
No kidding.

1713
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:47,700
I just realized I've been kind of blocking it a little bit.

1714
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:48,280
I'll move over.

1715
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:51,400
We'll get rid of the Noel, but I feel like I'm doing alright now.

1716
02:02:57,190 --> 02:02:58,190
Yeah, yeah, true.

1717
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:00,590
You and you.

1718
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:01,450
Goodbye!

1719
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:05,890
I hung the people!

1720
02:03:07,570 --> 02:03:07,930
Cool.

1721
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:12,870
But...

1722
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:19,470
I'm trying to...

1723
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:25,090
I'm trying to decide if I want to try for the multiplier ace.

1724
02:03:25,770 --> 02:03:26,550
Oh my god.

1725
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:31,430
Well, actually, no, this is a multiplier ace.

1726
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:32,010
I'm stupid.

1727
02:03:32,410 --> 02:03:33,830
Wait, but it's only when it stays in our hand.

1728
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:35,870
But if we have a bunch of them in our hands...

1729
02:03:35,870 --> 02:03:38,210
Well, then we wouldn't be able to play anything, huh?

1730
02:03:38,270 --> 02:03:38,650
Nevermind.

1731
02:03:38,770 --> 02:03:46,870
Well, if we played a good ace, if we played like one of these and then had like four of these in our hand...

1732
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:52,650
You know, it could work.

1733
02:03:54,190 --> 02:03:56,090
You could still play it, true.

1734
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:05,220
$3400.

1735
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:06,900
Okay, let's see.

1736
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:10,140
I have two aces.

1737
02:04:23,230 --> 02:04:25,710
I feel like I'm only ace-minded now.

1738
02:04:25,810 --> 02:04:28,350
I don't even know what any other cards' hands are.

1739
02:04:30,030 --> 02:04:32,510
I don't know anything else anymore.

1740
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:35,510
Wait, what was this?

1741
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:36,470
Every heart card.

1742
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:36,950
Okay, good.

1743
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:38,490
This will give us...

1744
02:04:41,090 --> 02:04:42,070
That's your build?

1745
02:04:42,230 --> 02:04:42,510
Okay.

1746
02:04:43,210 --> 02:04:43,710
Cool.

1747
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:48,470
Oh, we can keep... We can hold on to these maybe.

1748
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:19,280
Can I just see?

1749
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:19,820
Wait.

1750
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,900
We wouldn't be so much wooded.

1751
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:36,560
I'm just gonna see if I like could just play the tens and see what happens.

1752
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:43,200
Like with all of these in my hand, like how much of a multiplier it would be.

1753
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,160
Feed the castle.

1754
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:51,880
Do

1755
02:05:58,240 --> 02:05:58,600
it?

1756
02:05:58,700 --> 02:05:59,360
Try it?

1757
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:00,480
Let's see how much it is.

1758
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:01,640
I'm just curious.

1759
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:05,660
And then we'll discard...

1760
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:09,540
These I'll discard.

1761
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,540
Wait, I have a question.

1762
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:20,700
If I play these but they don't do anything, does it count as discarding for the castle?

1763
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:21,580
You know what I mean?

1764
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:26,500
No.

1765
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:29,760
Okay, it does not.

1766
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,400
Okay, okay, okay.

1767
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:33,100
Okay, okay.

1768
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:34,540
It does not count.

1769
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:35,420
Okay, okay, okay.

1770
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:39,740
So I would have to play it and then...

1771
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:42,220
We can do the four though.

1772
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:43,280
Yeah, we can do the four.

1773
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:47,100
Even though I was gonna attach... It doesn't really matter.

1774
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:48,180
I was gonna attach that there anyway.

1775
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:53,840
Alright,

1776
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:01,180
now let's throw all of these away.

1777
02:07:02,180 --> 02:07:04,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1778
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:05,420
Eat up, castle!

1779
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:07,340
Okay,

1780
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:19,770
I'm just gonna play this.

1781
02:07:21,230 --> 02:07:21,950
More discard?

1782
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:23,570
You guys are so greedy!

1783
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:29,430
Oh, I guess because I have another heart.

1784
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:30,430
Okay, okay, okay.

1785
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:32,670
Oh my god, what if I had pressed discard?

1786
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:35,210
What if I had pressed it?

1787
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,970
That would have been crazy.

1788
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:38,410
It hungers.

1789
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:39,810
Okay, okay.

1790
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:43,910
I think

1791
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:07,620
we might win.

1792
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:14,620
Yippee!

1793
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:22,920
Right click to deselect all by the way.

1794
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:23,760
Ah, thank you.

1795
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,180
Did not know that.

1796
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:28,080
Yippee!

1797
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:35,780
Level up two pair.

1798
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:37,800
Okay.

1799
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:44,560
Three dollars of discard is held in hand at the end of the round.

1800
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,140
Arcana pack.

1801
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:52,520
I guess this is better.

1802
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,340
Is this her first run ever?

1803
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:55,220
It is!

1804
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:02,270
Should I do both of them?

1805
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:12,980
Level up pair.

1806
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:14,740
Do we have...Oh!

1807
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:17,020
I was gonna say level up four of a kind!

1808
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:19,260
Yeah baby!

1809
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,220
Yeah baby!

1810
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:36,460
Let's try.

1811
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:41,020
Converts up to three selected cards to diamonds.

1812
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:44,980
Creates two random planet cards.

1813
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:51,960
Gives all...gives the total sell value of all current jokers.

1814
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,060
Currently fifteen dollars.

1815
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:58,000
Oh, I can get my money back.

1816
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:05,940
What does it mean must have room?

1817
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:18,820
Oh, like up here?

1818
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:22,980
Two consumable slots.

1819
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:32,240
I thought the planets were leveling up your four of a kind and the straight and everything like that.

1820
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:38,700
Oh, they do.

1821
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:41,420
Oh, but they are consumable.

1822
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:43,440
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

1823
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:46,340
Oh, I thought that you just...I need to get my money back.

1824
02:10:59,350 --> 02:11:00,530
Try a reroll.

1825
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:10,630
Play cards with odd rank.

1826
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:12,970
Give plus 31 chips when scored.

1827
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:15,050
What's holographic?

1828
02:11:15,970 --> 02:11:16,810
Fancy!

1829
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:28,560
Wait, it counts aces?

1830
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:38,870
Wait...

1831
02:11:40,350 --> 02:11:41,970
Oh yeah, it does.

1832
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:47,890
Because it's holographic it's a plus ten multiplier.

1833
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:52,710
Um...

1834
02:11:54,470 --> 02:11:56,590
What would be best to get rid of though?

1835
02:11:58,190 --> 02:12:00,570
Maybe Blue Junkler?

1836
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:09,190
We get rid of Ice Minky for Holographic Minky.

1837
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,530
Okay, sayonara.

1838
02:12:14,330 --> 02:12:18,730
Buy and use.

1839
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:25,780
Wow.

1840
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:31,000
We've purchased everything.

1841
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:34,460
Reorder.

1842
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,600
Here the chippies go first, right?

1843
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,300
But the multiplier...

1844
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:47,240
Wouldn't the multiplier go at the...

1845
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:49,740
Wait, oh, but it's a ten...oh, nevermind.

1846
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:50,520
Plus ten.

1847
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:52,300
It's not a times.

1848
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,580
Yeah, so I think this one would be good at the top.

1849
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:58,720
Because then it would multiply and then it would add more.

1850
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:02,000
And then they'll multiply from there.

1851
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:03,260
Oh my gosh!

1852
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:06,660
Pen to ice!

1853
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:08,760
Wait...

1854
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:09,400
Yeah!

1855
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:19,650
Okay!

1856
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:21,070
Okay!

1857
02:13:23,130 --> 02:13:26,030
Gives five dollars per skipped blind.

1858
02:13:26,770 --> 02:13:27,450
This run.

1859
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:30,630
Oh, so it would give me five dollars.

1860
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:34,650
Okay.

1861
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:36,370
Select.

1862
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:55,470
Wouldn't it be better maybe to get the Ice of Hearts?

1863
02:14:01,170 --> 02:14:02,570
We still have the bus.

1864
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:04,850
We still have our bus driver, so...

1865
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:05,770
We'll just...

1866
02:14:06,370 --> 02:14:08,570
We'll just get rid of this for now.

1867
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:09,190
Discard.

1868
02:14:09,370 --> 02:14:10,090
Wait, what's our thing?

1869
02:14:10,430 --> 02:14:11,550
Every heart card?

1870
02:14:14,450 --> 02:14:16,170
We're still riding the bus, babe.

1871
02:14:31,610 --> 02:14:33,150
We'll keep the five.

1872
02:14:33,150 --> 02:14:34,130
Discard.

1873
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:43,880
We might have to do it.

1874
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:44,280
We'll see.

1875
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:02,780
Guys, it's not looking so good.

1876
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,340
Guys, it's not looking so good.

1877
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:10,720
Guys,

1878
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:16,060
it's not... Are we cooked?

1879
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:33,120
We thought, we thought, we thought...

1880
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:36,960
Let's do this one, because I think we have a ton of...

1881
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,260
Of the Ace of Diamonds.

1882
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:45,360
And we only have one of the spades, so we'll do the spade.

1883
02:15:54,620 --> 02:15:55,820
You want them the same?

1884
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:56,420
No, no!

1885
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:58,260
You do, but you don't.

1886
02:15:58,380 --> 02:15:59,380
You do, but you don't.

1887
02:15:59,420 --> 02:16:01,080
Because, because...

1888
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:07,480
If I'm in a battle, if I'm in a boss battle and it says all diamonds are useless...

1889
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:12,500
If it says all diamonds are useless, then I am screwed.

1890
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:19,140
You have to think.

1891
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:21,700
We need the diversity.

1892
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:24,000
1, 2, 3, 4.

1893
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:28,790
And...

1894
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:30,210
You beat that boss already.

1895
02:16:30,330 --> 02:16:30,490
Wait.

1896
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:32,510
Did they not come back?

1897
02:16:33,970 --> 02:16:35,430
Did they not come back?

1898
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:36,230
Eventually?

1899
02:16:37,910 --> 02:16:39,350
Boss blind, don't repeat.

1900
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:41,210
How am I supposed to know that?

1901
02:16:43,410 --> 02:16:44,770
Wait a second.

1902
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:49,930
How am I supposed to know that?

1903
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:51,450
I'll just play this guy too.

1904
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:53,450
We'll get all the bonuses.

1905
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:56,870
Well, now you do.

1906
02:16:58,030 --> 02:16:59,590
Well, now you do.

1907
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:19,970
RIP Flush5, it's fine.

1908
02:17:19,970 --> 02:17:20,150
I'm in.

1909
02:17:22,170 --> 02:17:24,430
You guys, look how much money I'm in.

1910
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:27,550
Why, Vtuber, why?

1911
02:17:29,270 --> 02:17:30,230
Seed chat.

1912
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:35,390
It's the highest hand ever.

1913
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:38,330
You guys see how many I have?

1914
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:39,050
We'll get it again.

1915
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:40,310
I'll do it next time.

1916
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:42,290
Baseball.

1917
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,560
Uncommon jokers give 1.5.

1918
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:06,380
Free money.

1919
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:08,980
More free money.

1920
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:13,880
Buy and use.

1921
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,380
How much would that be?

1922
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:25,040
Does rare count?

1923
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,800
Rare doesn't count for baseball.

1924
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:29,220
Damn.

1925
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:36,220
I only just found out now that boss battles don't repeat literally just now.

1926
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:41,520
I guess you haven't gotten that far, huh?

1927
02:18:48,630 --> 02:18:49,830
Voucher is better.

1928
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:51,970
It doesn't do anything.

1929
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:53,570
Buy the voucher?

1930
02:18:54,770 --> 02:18:55,330
Voucher?

1931
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:57,510
Really?

1932
02:18:58,270 --> 02:18:59,470
Get the blankets worth?

1933
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:01,990
I feel like I'm getting gas lit here.

1934
02:19:02,090 --> 02:19:07,650
I feel like I'm being told to buy the Pekojuice in the Holocure Casino.

1935
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:24,620
Buy it for progress.

1936
02:19:45,930 --> 02:19:47,870
I'm getting scammed.

1937
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:51,830
My grandma just called me and she's just like...

1938
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:52,910
Help!

1939
02:19:53,590 --> 02:19:54,830
It's me, Minto!

1940
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:58,230
I need your bank account information!

1941
02:19:59,190 --> 02:20:01,990
Because I've been kidnapped by the Mafia!

1942
02:20:03,610 --> 02:20:05,630
Okay grandma, I'll get you out of there.

1943
02:20:05,910 --> 02:20:06,830
How do I help?

1944
02:20:07,350 --> 02:20:11,690
Send me 20 Walmart gift cards!

1945
02:20:11,690 --> 02:20:14,350
It's the only currency they accept!

1946
02:20:32,850 --> 02:20:34,150
Let's try a planet.

1947
02:20:35,550 --> 02:20:37,290
You are the grandma here.

1948
02:20:41,290 --> 02:20:44,410
Straight, flush, three of a kind.

1949
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:47,850
Actually, three of a kind might be good in case our luck is bad.

1950
02:20:49,470 --> 02:20:51,650
My bank account number...

1951
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:51,990
No!

1952
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:53,930
Made of time!

1953
02:20:55,970 --> 02:20:56,610
Flush?

1954
02:20:56,950 --> 02:20:58,110
You think the flush?

1955
02:20:58,750 --> 02:20:59,610
It was a flush.

1956
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:01,890
Five cards that share the same unit.

1957
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:05,090
Here is one gift card.

1958
02:21:05,170 --> 02:21:06,090
I'll get the rest later.

1959
02:21:06,450 --> 02:21:06,450
Trust.

1960
02:21:07,390 --> 02:21:08,150
Thanks Jamie.

1961
02:21:09,010 --> 02:21:10,610
Grandma is waiting for it.

1962
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:16,430
I think three of a kind though, right?

1963
02:21:16,510 --> 02:21:19,730
Just in case we only get three aces or something.

1964
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:24,650
If something goes wrong, I feel this would be better.

1965
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:26,050
I'm gonna do it.

1966
02:21:26,110 --> 02:21:26,970
I'm not listening to you guys.

1967
02:21:27,790 --> 02:21:31,810
I think three is safe.

1968
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:35,590
Should I try the Arcana path?

1969
02:21:41,170 --> 02:21:42,110
No error.

1970
02:21:52,750 --> 02:21:57,810
Increases rank of two cards selected by one.

1971
02:21:57,810 --> 02:22:00,510
If only I had a king!

1972
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:05,870
If only I had a king!

1973
02:22:11,710 --> 02:22:14,690
Destroys up to two selected cards.

1974
02:22:15,630 --> 02:22:17,530
This one could be good though.

1975
02:22:19,570 --> 02:22:23,950
Converts up to three selected cards of diamonds to spades.

1976
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:27,110
We have sixteen dollars.

1977
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:29,690
But we can get our money back.

1978
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:33,870
Fin the low numbers.

1979
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:35,330
I guess that's fair.

1980
02:22:35,890 --> 02:22:38,870
Wait, can I... Does this have to be used right now?

1981
02:22:39,530 --> 02:22:44,410
I could destroy these.

1982
02:22:45,690 --> 02:22:46,310
Oh no.

1983
02:22:46,850 --> 02:22:47,970
Goodbye multi-card.

1984
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:51,270
No...

1985
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:02,760
Immediate use for packs.

1986
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:14,420
This is our deck right now.

1987
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:15,500
This is what we got.

1988
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:19,340
We're thinning out the family.

1989
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:22,080
The royal family is going down.

1990
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:26,040
Cards drawn face down after each hand played.

1991
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:30,680
What?

1992
02:23:53,150 --> 02:23:53,810
We have

1993
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:06,800
four.

1994
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,060
So I'm guessing they're all going to flip upside down.

1995
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:24,400
These ones will come in upside down.

1996
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:27,060
But if I sort them by rank, we'll be okay.

1997
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:29,640
We just have to...

1998
02:24:35,450 --> 02:24:36,230
Kind of.

1999
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:37,870
These cards aren't in place.

2000
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:39,150
Wait, what's our thing?

2001
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:39,690
Heart.

2002
02:24:49,230 --> 02:24:51,250
What was it that... Oh, diamond, right?

2003
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:54,170
That I was trying to get the flush...

2004
02:24:54,170 --> 02:24:57,050
The five of a flush.

2005
02:24:58,750 --> 02:25:00,470
Oh look, it's on there now.

2006
02:25:08,350 --> 02:25:09,770
It was heart, right?

2007
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,510
Goodbye!

2008
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:20,360
We're trying for it.

2009
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:21,340
We're going for it.

2010
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:29,210
One more.

2011
02:25:29,470 --> 02:25:30,090
This is it.

2012
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:31,310
This is it!

2013
02:25:32,090 --> 02:25:35,190
This is my first stream in Mint's lab so I'm living in infectious.

2014
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:37,790
Thank you!

2015
02:25:39,270 --> 02:25:40,230
Welcome RetroCandy!

2016
02:25:40,470 --> 02:25:41,530
Thanks for the superchat.

2017
02:25:41,870 --> 02:25:45,110
Came in to see, not sure what's going on, but get better soon.

2018
02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:46,090
I'm better!

2019
02:25:46,830 --> 02:25:48,150
I'm so good now.

2020
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:53,670
No!

2021
02:25:55,590 --> 02:25:56,630
I'm not better.

2022
02:25:57,230 --> 02:25:58,770
This is, everything sucks.

2023
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:02,470
Wait, how does it... Everybody sucks!

2024
02:26:02,810 --> 02:26:03,850
Everybody sucks!

2025
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:05,110
You don't really know what...

2026
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:08,730
Okay, let's see.

2027
02:26:08,830 --> 02:26:09,830
How do we want to do this?

2028
02:26:11,110 --> 02:26:12,270
Let's keep this in the hand.

2029
02:26:12,470 --> 02:26:13,890
One, two, three.

2030
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:32,120
We can get rid of these.

2031
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:44,220
Why though?

2032
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:45,540
Oh the bus!

2033
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:46,580
You're right, thank you.

2034
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:49,320
Thank you, I almost forgot.

2035
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:51,580
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2036
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:52,480
You guys saved me!

2037
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:54,160
The bus was going to crash!

2038
02:27:05,580 --> 02:27:06,300
Play hand.

2039
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,000
Four of a kind?

2040
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:13,160
I want to see if we can get the four of a kind here.

2041
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:15,280
Am I being too risky?

2042
02:27:23,690 --> 02:27:25,590
Should I just play all of them?

2043
02:27:29,810 --> 02:27:31,150
I know what the boss is.

2044
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:33,770
Cards drawn face down after each hand played.

2045
02:27:34,390 --> 02:27:34,970
I know.

2046
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:39,160
I read.

2047
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:44,120
But if anything is in front of this guy, we know that it's... Well, not anything.

2048
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:45,980
I wish he were a king.

2049
02:27:50,700 --> 02:27:53,140
Okay, maybe I don't want to risk it.

2050
02:27:56,430 --> 02:27:57,330
Oh, what?

2051
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,240
Fine!

2052
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:21,700
Four is better.

2053
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:23,140
Oh, okay.

2054
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:25,080
Oh yeah, we did level up four.

2055
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:26,240
True.

2056
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:28,340
Oh yeah, true, true, true.

2057
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,460
Okay, play.

2058
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:40,950
Is there a planet to level up five of a kind?

2059
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:50,080
Yes?

2060
02:28:53,810 --> 02:28:55,250
We'll just have to get that.

2061
02:28:58,410 --> 02:29:00,250
Twelve bucks!

2062
02:29:01,950 --> 02:29:02,870
Smile.

2063
02:29:03,390 --> 02:29:07,570
Oh, minus one ante, minus one hand each round.

2064
02:29:09,690 --> 02:29:10,610
Huh?

2065
02:29:12,230 --> 02:29:13,710
We got this guy again.

2066
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:17,150
Place face cards, give...

2067
02:29:18,330 --> 02:29:20,610
But it's not as good as this one.

2068
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:23,350
It's not as good as this one.

2069
02:29:25,930 --> 02:29:27,150
Resets back a round.

2070
02:29:30,130 --> 02:29:32,330
Vouchers too big brain for first round.

2071
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:38,750
Millions, millions, welcome to Mambo Ship.

2072
02:29:38,850 --> 02:29:39,650
Thank you!

2073
02:29:41,350 --> 02:29:43,610
I imagine this can be used...

2074
02:29:45,130 --> 02:29:51,550
to farm stuff, money, planets, arcanas I imagine.

2075
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:59,560
Let's open stuff.

2076
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:00,900
Gotcha!

2077
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:03,120
Flush.

2078
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:04,480
Well there you guys go.

2079
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:06,580
The flush, right?

2080
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:10,400
It's not a straight flush, but it is a flush.

2081
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:14,280
We'll do the flush.

2082
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:16,240
Wait, what was the other one?

2083
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:16,840
High card.

2084
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:22,180
Oh wait, high card for when we...

2085
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:24,140
play our first ace, right?

2086
02:30:28,270 --> 02:30:28,950
Nevermind.

2087
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:43,340
Select two cards, convert the left card into the right card.

2088
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:46,060
No!

2089
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:50,000
I wish I could...can I move these?

2090
02:31:05,470 --> 02:31:06,970
What are the other ones though?

2091
02:31:07,150 --> 02:31:10,650
Enhances two selected cards to lucky cards.

2092
02:31:11,790 --> 02:31:13,650
Are these not lucky enough?

2093
02:31:13,750 --> 02:31:15,430
They're bonus cards, but what's a lucky card?

2094
02:31:15,610 --> 02:31:17,090
1 in 5 chance for plus 20.

2095
02:31:17,470 --> 02:31:19,390
1 in 15 chance to win $20.

2096
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:24,490
Creates up to two random tarot cards.

2097
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:29,790
Before I select this...

2098
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:30,750
Oh, drag to rearrange.

2099
02:31:30,970 --> 02:31:31,450
I'm an idiot.

2100
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:36,390
I did read this and I have moved this correctly, right?

2101
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:40,310
Converts the left card into the right card.

2102
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:43,670
Yes!

2103
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:47,650
They cannot be both lucky and a bonus.

2104
02:31:48,090 --> 02:31:49,450
I see, thank you.

2105
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:51,270
Use.

2106
02:31:57,790 --> 02:32:00,290
Maybe I should have done like a 2 or something.

2107
02:32:00,370 --> 02:32:01,370
Like a low number.

2108
02:32:01,930 --> 02:32:02,590
Oh well, whatever.

2109
02:32:04,190 --> 02:32:05,430
Thank you for the 20 gift.

2110
02:32:05,550 --> 02:32:06,430
Thank you!

2111
02:32:07,490 --> 02:32:08,970
Alright, next round.

2112
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:11,930
What do we give?

2113
02:32:11,970 --> 02:32:12,350
We skip.

2114
02:32:12,890 --> 02:32:13,870
Free spectral pack.

2115
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:19,390
Nice!

2116
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:31,480
Ring, ring, ring.

2117
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:33,440
I

2118
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:50,160
wonder if we can get the all diamonds.

2119
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:54,100
Discard!

2120
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:03,900
Flush 5.

2121
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:04,740
We're trying.

2122
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:06,140
Discard!

2123
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:11,120
We have the 4.

2124
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:13,160
Alright.

2125
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:15,880
Last chance.

2126
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:16,720
One card.

2127
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:20,140
Just one.

2128
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:21,820
Single.

2129
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:23,600
Card.

2130
02:33:27,480 --> 02:33:29,460
To get the ace of diamonds.

2131
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:35,080
Discard the left ace.

2132
02:33:40,220 --> 02:33:42,740
Discard the ace, Mito!

2133
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:50,000
It's ok, I think we still win.

2134
02:34:04,180 --> 02:34:05,980
I think we still win.

2135
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:18,500
Mega pack!

2136
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:21,740
Oh, hi Blue Joker.

2137
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,160
Oh gosh, this is awkward.

2138
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:27,100
Hi Blue Joker!

2139
02:34:27,620 --> 02:34:29,540
Oh gosh, we haven't seen you in a while.

2140
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:34,180
Let's open some packs.

2141
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:43,200
Straight flush.

2142
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,980
3 of a kind.

2143
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:54,320
Straight.

2144
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:57,120
But straight is...no.

2145
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:58,660
Pluto.

2146
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:02,960
I think we should do Mars and Pluto, right?

2147
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:10,180
Straight flush.

2148
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:11,520
3 of a kind.

2149
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:15,720
We don't

2150
02:35:18,810 --> 02:35:20,210
do the consecutives anymore.

2151
02:35:20,390 --> 02:35:22,630
We have our...we basically have our build.

2152
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:25,810
It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.

2153
02:35:26,990 --> 02:35:28,930
Always invest in high card, baby.

2154
02:35:32,290 --> 02:35:36,190
I'm so used to the game speed being at max that your game seems so slow.

2155
02:35:36,510 --> 02:35:36,950
What?

2156
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:40,210
It can go...what?

2157
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:45,090
It feels fast to me.

2158
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:53,170
Faster!

2159
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:01,240
Planet card go!

2160
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:04,840
Mars?

2161
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:08,000
5 of a kind.

2162
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:09,660
I found it.

2163
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:10,520
Planet X.

2164
02:36:11,060 --> 02:36:12,020
Full house.

2165
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:14,200
Flush.

2166
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:18,960
Sorry, I know I check these all the time, but it's because I can't remember.

2167
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:23,820
5 cars share the same unit.

2168
02:36:25,500 --> 02:36:27,120
Everybody wants Planet X.

2169
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:28,420
2 pair.

2170
02:36:32,340 --> 02:36:35,420
Flush or...Planet X, I feel.

2171
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:37,940
I mean Mars is also very tempting.

2172
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:40,560
Planet X!

2173
02:36:42,660 --> 02:36:44,560
I've never seen Planet X.

2174
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:44,920
Really?

2175
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:49,040
It hasn't been discovered in your solar system yet.

2176
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:52,820
Adds 1 voucher.

2177
02:36:53,300 --> 02:36:54,760
That's kind of exciting.

2178
02:37:01,300 --> 02:37:01,920
Lights.

2179
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:09,540
Wait, I like watching the numbers...

2180
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:11,940
The numbers went up too fast.

2181
02:37:11,940 --> 02:37:12,100
Wait!

2182
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:17,220
It's too fast.

2183
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:18,600
It's too fast.

2184
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:20,620
I like watching the numbers go up.

2185
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:24,380
What if I put it at 0.5?

2186
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:30,740
Ok, ok, ok.

2187
02:37:30,980 --> 02:37:31,620
Let's see.

2188
02:37:32,140 --> 02:37:33,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2189
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:34,920
What's our castle?

2190
02:37:35,020 --> 02:37:35,620
It's a heart.

2191
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:38,940
What if I accidentally...

2192
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:43,120
It's very...Joker unlocked?

2193
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:44,240
Wait, what was that?

2194
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:55,260
Driver's license.

2195
02:37:58,360 --> 02:37:59,720
Olivia Rodrigo.

2196
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:11,100
I feel like I should just do the 4.

2197
02:38:15,820 --> 02:38:17,880
The bus driver has a license now.

2198
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:19,880
I wasn't driving before!

2199
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:24,200
But maybe we should try for...

2200
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:25,900
Let's do the 4.

2201
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:28,460
Our 4 of a kind is level 4.

2202
02:38:28,660 --> 02:38:30,000
So it's pretty strong I feel.

2203
02:38:56,870 --> 02:39:00,510
Enhances 1 selected card to a steel card.

2204
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:05,880
Crazy Joker.

2205
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:14,300
When small blind or big blind is selected, gain 0.5 multiplier and destroy a random Joker.

2206
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:16,580
Craziness.

2207
02:39:17,580 --> 02:39:19,060
More steel.

2208
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:21,580
I

2209
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:31,750
currently can't fathom how this card would be...

2210
02:39:32,470 --> 02:39:37,770
I mean, obviously I see the multiplier as a bonus, but...

2211
02:39:37,770 --> 02:39:38,830
What?

2212
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:44,750
Alright, let's do...

2213
02:39:46,330 --> 02:39:47,430
You know what?

2214
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:48,470
What if we get an ace?

2215
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:50,070
If not, we can just skip it, right?

2216
02:39:50,230 --> 02:39:51,250
If I don't get the ace?

2217
02:39:56,650 --> 02:39:58,690
Crazy is good if you get it really early.

2218
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:04,260
Let's do the Celestial Pack first.

2219
02:40:09,540 --> 02:40:11,300
Pluto or Planet X?

2220
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:13,220
Planet X!

2221
02:40:19,030 --> 02:40:19,510
Ace!

2222
02:40:19,670 --> 02:40:19,930
Ace!

2223
02:40:20,110 --> 02:40:20,450
AB!

2224
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:21,290
Ace!

2225
02:40:21,490 --> 02:40:21,790
Ace!

2226
02:40:21,790 --> 02:40:21,950
Ace...

2227
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:29,130
That's awkward.

2228
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:32,570
Skip a skip.

2229
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:33,810
Skip a skip.

2230
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:40,860
Yeah, because I have a full deck.

2231
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,640
Since I have 61 out of 61 cards...

2232
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:49,420
Wait, can I... I can't get more cards, right?

2233
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:52,000
Like I'd have to... Oh yeah, I was going to buy the Chariot.

2234
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:52,340
Thank you.

2235
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:52,380
Yeah.

2236
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:56,840
Oh, you can?

2237
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:03,950
It would go to 62.

2238
02:41:04,250 --> 02:41:04,910
Oh, okay.

2239
02:41:06,590 --> 02:41:09,410
No repeat hand types this round.

2240
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:17,640
Okay.

2241
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:29,000
Heart card.

2242
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:50,280
But what if...

2243
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:53,000
But what if...

2244
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,820
We got the fifth one.

2245
02:42:06,030 --> 02:42:08,630
I'm going to do...

2246
02:42:10,330 --> 02:42:11,070
Okay, hold on.

2247
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:13,150
I'm going to play these two.

2248
02:42:13,570 --> 02:42:14,850
And throw this away.

2249
02:42:17,290 --> 02:42:19,190
So that we can have three chances.

2250
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:31,860
Wait, wait.

2251
02:42:32,680 --> 02:42:33,320
Oh no!

2252
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:45,040
I tried.

2253
02:42:48,710 --> 02:42:48,890
I tried.

2254
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:52,930
If you get the fifth one, I'll propose.

2255
02:42:53,790 --> 02:42:55,410
Well, Evan, you're safe today.

2256
02:42:56,350 --> 02:42:58,490
Reroll boss blind one time per ante.

2257
02:42:58,990 --> 02:43:00,270
Ten dollars per roll.

2258
02:43:02,010 --> 02:43:02,490
Stingy!

2259
02:43:02,750 --> 02:43:03,630
Ten dollars?

2260
02:43:08,490 --> 02:43:09,390
Everybody's saying to get it.

2261
02:43:09,450 --> 02:43:10,250
Oh, director's cut.

2262
02:43:10,350 --> 02:43:10,910
Let's see this one.

2263
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:12,030
Plus one hand type!

2264
02:43:14,490 --> 02:43:16,310
Oh wait, I don't have any room.

2265
02:43:19,090 --> 02:43:22,470
Minus four multiplier per round played.

2266
02:43:22,930 --> 02:43:28,600
I like castle.

2267
02:43:29,860 --> 02:43:31,520
It's hungry.

2268
02:43:34,600 --> 02:43:36,340
Early game joker.

2269
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:38,560
Yeah, let's buy some packs.

2270
02:43:56,440 --> 02:44:00,060
Wait, can you have a full stone deck?

2271
02:44:01,180 --> 02:44:02,280
Broken stone.

2272
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:05,440
Wow, glass card.

2273
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:06,620
I've never seen that one before.

2274
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:08,000
You can!

2275
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:11,300
One in four chance to destroy card.

2276
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:12,560
Oh no, that's so scary!

2277
02:44:14,460 --> 02:44:15,920
It counts as a high card.

2278
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:24,560
What do you mean, just a plus fifty?

2279
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:28,020
Okay, well...

2280
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:30,200
That would be exciting if it was like...

2281
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:34,000
Whatever you paired it with, it kind of was...

2282
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,020
But I guess not.

2283
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:37,240
Let's try this one.

2284
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:40,800
Oh, I unlocked it.

2285
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:45,780
I unlocked a deck.

2286
02:44:45,780 --> 02:44:46,860
I don't know what I...

2287
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:51,520
Nice.

2288
02:44:54,780 --> 02:44:57,220
Oh, he also gained a multi... Oh my god!

2289
02:44:57,460 --> 02:45:00,360
This guy is so powerful.

2290
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:03,660
Holy moly.

2291
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:07,040
Gives five dollars... I always want to click this first.

2292
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:09,040
Five dollars per skip the blind.

2293
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:09,600
No!

2294
02:45:23,170 --> 02:45:24,730
We were so close to beating that.

2295
02:45:26,750 --> 02:45:27,590
First time.

2296
02:45:28,610 --> 02:45:32,350
The hologram is getting... He's getting big.

2297
02:45:37,830 --> 02:45:38,670
What's our thing?

2298
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:39,170
Diamond.

2299
02:45:43,910 --> 02:45:44,910
We'll still win.

2300
02:45:45,030 --> 02:45:46,610
One, two, three, four, five.

2301
02:45:46,650 --> 02:45:47,330
We'll still win.

2302
02:45:47,730 --> 02:45:48,850
We'll still win, it's fine.

2303
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:55,730
The flash vibe, baby!

2304
02:46:09,480 --> 02:46:10,520
Reserved parking.

2305
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:11,000
Oh, moon.

2306
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:14,280
Converts up to three selected cards to clubs.

2307
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:16,520
Oh, I forgot to use this.

2308
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:17,040
Oopsie.

2309
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:23,760
Each face card held in hand has a one in two chance to give a doll.

2310
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:26,180
Oh, face card go away.

2311
02:46:30,340 --> 02:46:36,140
I thought you spent the last round, Evan.

2312
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:41,380
It's all about sending a message with a flash vibe.

2313
02:46:41,780 --> 02:46:42,340
Exactly.

2314
02:46:43,080 --> 02:46:45,340
Let's buy some cards.

2315
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:49,360
Choose one.

2316
02:46:50,300 --> 02:46:52,120
Destroys up to two selected cards.

2317
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:53,840
I could do that.

2318
02:46:54,220 --> 02:46:58,980
Enhances two selected cards to...

2319
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:00,740
Oh, all my aces are taken though.

2320
02:47:01,940 --> 02:47:05,680
Converts up to... Soon we're going to have all aces.

2321
02:47:05,940 --> 02:47:10,680
And we're going to have to strategize what kind of aces we get.

2322
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,120
Oh my god.

2323
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:13,560
What was the sign?

2324
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:15,020
Converts up to three into heart.

2325
02:47:15,660 --> 02:47:18,480
My friends hate it when I play Flush 5 on Poker Night.

2326
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:23,320
Goodbye.

2327
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:24,700
Goodbye.

2328
02:47:25,340 --> 02:47:25,940
Goodbye.

2329
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:26,260
Goodbye.

2330
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:30,560
Turn them all.

2331
02:47:31,660 --> 02:47:33,140
Only aces allowed.

2332
02:47:34,180 --> 02:47:35,660
Convert it all to one suit.

2333
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:37,980
What if I just thin out my hand?

2334
02:47:39,580 --> 02:47:40,540
I think it'll be better.

2335
02:47:41,260 --> 02:47:43,400
Down with the royal family.

2336
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:46,260
That's okay.

2337
02:47:47,580 --> 02:47:48,120
Hi Minto.

2338
02:47:48,300 --> 02:47:49,180
Hello Rem.

2339
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:52,240
Open.

2340
02:47:54,340 --> 02:47:55,380
Mars.

2341
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:56,120
Earth.

2342
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:57,180
Flush.

2343
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:01,240
Question.

2344
02:48:01,960 --> 02:48:04,100
How many levels are there for the planets?

2345
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:12,270
Infinite?

2346
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:18,270
Our Flush 4 is kind of...

2347
02:48:18,270 --> 02:48:19,230
Wait.

2348
02:48:19,830 --> 02:48:21,590
What was the moon?

2349
02:48:24,310 --> 02:48:25,330
My bad.

2350
02:48:26,730 --> 02:48:28,430
I forgot what it was anyway.

2351
02:48:29,770 --> 02:48:30,690
Mega buffoon.

2352
02:48:32,250 --> 02:48:33,530
Oh, the clubs.

2353
02:48:33,670 --> 02:48:34,070
Yeah, yeah.

2354
02:48:34,110 --> 02:48:34,370
Thank you.

2355
02:48:37,410 --> 02:48:38,090
Okay.

2356
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:39,650
Heart.

2357
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:42,970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2358
02:48:46,210 --> 02:48:49,070
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2359
02:48:50,650 --> 02:48:51,570
In the club.

2360
02:48:52,830 --> 02:48:53,810
What the heck?

2361
02:48:54,130 --> 02:48:54,990
Where is my steel?

2362
02:48:56,550 --> 02:48:58,470
1, 2, 3, 4.

2363
02:48:58,770 --> 02:48:59,250
Discard.

2364
02:49:01,790 --> 02:49:02,930
Still no steel.

2365
02:49:05,590 --> 02:49:06,730
Oh, the chariot.

2366
02:49:07,950 --> 02:49:09,270
Can turn into steel.

2367
02:49:10,490 --> 02:49:12,590
We do have this guy just kind of chilling over here.

2368
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:17,890
Ears.

2369
02:49:21,570 --> 02:49:23,330
Okay, I got my steel.

2370
02:49:28,900 --> 02:49:29,540
Easy.

2371
02:49:30,480 --> 02:49:32,080
1, 2, 3.

2372
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:33,040
Discard.

2373
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:37,060
Oh, come on.

2374
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:38,060
Where were you?

2375
02:49:42,740 --> 02:49:46,480
We can... 1, 2, 3, 4.

2376
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:50,640
5?

2377
02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:51,440
Take the 5?

2378
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:51,900
Yeah, true.

2379
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:52,320
5.

2380
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:55,320
We've actually... We've upgraded our 5 of a kind, so...

2381
02:49:57,980 --> 02:49:59,300
It'll be big money.

2382
02:50:03,240 --> 02:50:04,280
Big money.

2383
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:06,640
Holy... Oh my god.

2384
02:50:07,280 --> 02:50:09,520
I didn't think that kind of big money.

2385
02:50:19,690 --> 02:50:21,170
Converts 3 to diamond.

2386
02:50:21,690 --> 02:50:22,490
What does this guy have?

2387
02:50:22,530 --> 02:50:23,330
3.5.

2388
02:50:24,130 --> 02:50:27,950
Each played card with spade suits gives 1.5.

2389
02:50:28,390 --> 02:50:29,950
Suit changes at the end of the round.

2390
02:50:36,150 --> 02:50:40,010
This one might be good to switch out.

2391
02:51:02,170 --> 02:51:04,070
Not... Say it's like a diamond.

2392
02:51:04,250 --> 02:51:05,570
We have so many ace diamonds.

2393
02:51:05,750 --> 02:51:07,070
Would it not be so good?

2394
02:51:12,220 --> 02:51:13,280
It's risky.

2395
02:51:15,080 --> 02:51:15,740
Is it?

2396
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:16,640
I have a question.

2397
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:17,460
Is it?

2398
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:19,960
Would they all have to be the same?

2399
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:25,520
Or is it like... I play a hand with like one spade.

2400
02:51:27,080 --> 02:51:28,460
Oh, they have to be the same.

2401
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:28,800
No?

2402
02:51:33,230 --> 02:51:33,930
Wait, huh?

2403
02:51:34,830 --> 02:51:35,890
So each...

2404
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:38,790
No, it's just card by card.

2405
02:51:39,010 --> 02:51:40,270
Then why wouldn't it be good?

2406
02:51:44,580 --> 02:51:44,980
Why?

2407
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:45,820
It changes.

2408
02:51:45,940 --> 02:51:47,220
Yeah, I know, but like...

2409
02:51:47,220 --> 02:51:51,040
I use spade as the example because it's written right there.

2410
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:01,900
Because it's always changing.

2411
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:04,920
But I have...

2412
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:09,140
It's good, but castle is better?

2413
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:12,380
Okay, I'll trust you guys.

2414
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:16,760
I'm not quite understanding what the issue is.

2415
02:52:17,480 --> 02:52:22,260
I'm not quite understand... Okay, so for example...

2416
02:52:23,260 --> 02:52:26,800
If I put down... We're doing four of a kind.

2417
02:52:27,020 --> 02:52:28,260
It's ace of spades...

2418
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:31,460
Ace of... And three ace of hearts, right?

2419
02:52:31,860 --> 02:52:34,160
Ace of spades, three ace of hearts is what we got, right?

2420
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:40,060
Say it's a multiplier with spade.

2421
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:43,280
Would I not get 1.5 times multiplied then?

2422
02:52:50,920 --> 02:52:52,420
You'd get 1.5.

2423
02:52:53,380 --> 02:52:55,280
Yeah, wouldn't that be good?

2424
02:52:55,760 --> 02:52:58,980
Wouldn't that be better than the 93 chips?

2425
02:53:10,900 --> 02:53:15,140
You guys are saying yes, but keep feeding the castle.

2426
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:22,540
It's just inconsistent.

2427
02:53:22,540 --> 02:53:23,120
Okay!

2428
02:53:25,320 --> 02:53:25,820
Okay!

2429
02:53:38,340 --> 02:53:40,040
The DNA has done its job?

2430
02:53:40,100 --> 02:53:41,000
No, it's not.

2431
02:53:41,640 --> 02:53:43,540
The DNA is not finished yet.

2432
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:47,680
The DNA remains.

2433
02:53:49,960 --> 02:53:53,120
Because I might not just want to duplicate the steel cards.

2434
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:55,100
I might want to duplicate every card.

2435
02:53:58,440 --> 02:53:59,220
You get it?

2436
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:01,320
I agree with you because it could be good.

2437
02:54:01,400 --> 02:54:01,840
That's it!

2438
02:54:04,060 --> 02:54:05,360
It's fine though.

2439
02:54:11,220 --> 02:54:12,220
Three of a kind.

2440
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:13,000
Straight.

2441
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:14,900
Full house.

2442
02:54:15,900 --> 02:54:16,380
Two pair.

2443
02:54:17,060 --> 02:54:18,060
Straight flush.

2444
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:22,680
Straight flush we could do, right?

2445
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:26,880
No.

2446
02:54:27,900 --> 02:54:29,380
No, not straight flush.

2447
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:32,680
I was thinking of something else.

2448
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:35,580
I was just thinking of the flush.

2449
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:38,080
No!

2450
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:40,080
I was thinking of just the flush.

2451
02:54:43,840 --> 02:54:47,100
We'll do the three of a kind then.

2452
02:54:49,490 --> 02:54:49,850
Maybe?

2453
02:54:51,750 --> 02:54:52,750
I guess so.

2454
02:54:53,870 --> 02:54:55,350
I'm not going to waste it.

2455
02:54:55,990 --> 02:54:57,590
I'm not going to waste it.

2456
02:54:58,310 --> 02:54:59,390
Mega standard.

2457
02:55:08,390 --> 02:55:10,290
Why does it look like that?

2458
02:55:11,070 --> 02:55:12,270
Wild card?

2459
02:55:13,230 --> 02:55:14,910
Can be used as any suit?

2460
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:21,120
Any...

2461
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:22,200
Skip.

2462
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:29,200
Four flushes.

2463
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:39,020
I mean we could get a card to feed the Joker, true?

2464
02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:41,760
True, true, true.

2465
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:41,840
True?

2466
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:48,120
I guess it doesn't really matter what.

2467
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:49,580
We'll just throw it away.

2468
02:55:53,080 --> 02:55:54,260
And we get to feed two.

2469
02:55:54,360 --> 02:55:55,800
We get to choose two of them.

2470
02:55:56,700 --> 02:55:58,120
But the consistency, I know.

2471
02:55:58,540 --> 02:55:59,280
It hurts me too.

2472
02:55:59,860 --> 02:56:01,080
Trust me, it hurts me too.

2473
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:06,120
You can strength to turn the queens into aces.

2474
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:07,740
That is enough to sell me.

2475
02:56:19,430 --> 02:56:20,830
Next round!

2476
02:56:22,230 --> 02:56:23,470
The boss.

2477
02:56:24,290 --> 02:56:25,350
First hand is drawn.

2478
02:56:25,450 --> 02:56:26,190
OK, this one.

2479
02:56:42,140 --> 02:56:43,500
Discard everything?

2480
02:56:59,050 --> 02:57:01,430
OK, so these are our aces.

2481
02:57:03,230 --> 02:57:04,350
Now we know.

2482
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:08,280
Now we know.

2483
02:57:08,880 --> 02:57:09,620
Now we know.

2484
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:19,620
See, I think I might... I want to play this one so I can get more of him too, you know what I mean?

2485
02:57:22,560 --> 02:57:27,780
But this is a boss round, so we must play smart.

2486
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:32,020
Order by suit?

2487
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:35,120
Oh, I don't like that.

2488
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:40,640
Sorry, I don't like that.

2489
02:57:40,940 --> 02:57:41,980
Let me just throw these away.

2490
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:43,440
Go away.

2491
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:47,140
And you also go away.

2492
02:58:01,030 --> 02:58:03,430
Oh, I played it out of...

2493
02:58:05,650 --> 02:58:06,850
Wait, this one?

2494
02:58:07,310 --> 02:58:08,490
Oh shoot, I wasn't paying attention.

2495
02:58:08,590 --> 02:58:11,270
This one is a steal card.

2496
02:58:13,430 --> 02:58:15,750
I don't remember which other steal card it was.

2497
02:58:16,850 --> 02:58:17,330
I don't...

2498
02:58:19,950 --> 02:58:21,870
The two on the left are the steal?

2499
02:58:22,990 --> 02:58:23,470
By

2500
02:58:26,860 --> 02:58:27,300
rank?

2501
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:28,060
That's what I...

2502
02:58:28,060 --> 02:58:31,960
Oh, steal is the toughest... is the bestest?

2503
02:58:32,500 --> 02:58:33,640
I see, I see.

2504
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:42,640
Exploding Otome!

2505
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:45,000
So welcome to my village and thank you!

2506
02:58:46,180 --> 02:58:47,840
And that's a win baby!

2507
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:48,040
Yeah!

2508
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:53,560
Achievement unlocked.

2509
02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:54,560
Oh, anti-8!

2510
02:58:59,830 --> 02:59:00,470
Sad.

2511
02:59:00,990 --> 02:59:02,670
Oh my gosh, this is an actual jungler.

2512
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:06,150
Create a tarot card if hand is played with $4 to let know.

2513
02:59:07,470 --> 02:59:08,630
Wild card.

2514
02:59:10,590 --> 02:59:13,110
Rerolls cost $2 less.

2515
02:59:21,020 --> 02:59:22,100
Cardboard jungler.

2516
02:59:22,900 --> 02:59:25,720
He's like actually from the movie, the jungler.

2517
02:59:28,940 --> 02:59:29,740
Good voucher.

2518
02:59:32,500 --> 02:59:34,180
Oh my gosh, wait, I'm almost out of money.

2519
02:59:34,580 --> 02:59:35,760
I need to stop spending so much.

2520
02:59:36,880 --> 02:59:37,280
Jumbo.

2521
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:45,240
Wild card would be good on one of our aces, wouldn't it?

2522
02:59:50,110 --> 02:59:52,630
The palacho is the friend we made along the way.

2523
02:59:59,510 --> 03:00:00,890
Kana for free.

2524
03:00:00,910 --> 03:00:01,550
Free money?

2525
03:00:02,130 --> 03:00:03,510
We don't know if we will.

2526
03:00:05,850 --> 03:00:07,250
Wild card overrides other buff.

2527
03:00:07,350 --> 03:00:08,450
Okay, nevermind.

2528
03:00:08,750 --> 03:00:09,110
Understood.

2529
03:00:12,990 --> 03:00:14,110
Big pack!

2530
03:00:17,720 --> 03:00:18,440
Let's see.

2531
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:20,120
Doubles money!

2532
03:00:21,280 --> 03:00:22,460
I could get more money.

2533
03:00:24,400 --> 03:00:30,620
1 in 4 chance to add a foil holographic or polychrome addition to a random joker.

2534
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:40,320
Creates up to 2 random tarot cards.

2535
03:00:40,480 --> 03:00:42,940
Creates up to 2 random planet cards.

2536
03:00:43,940 --> 03:00:44,980
The wheel.

2537
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:47,160
Select 2 cards.

2538
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:48,200
Wait.

2539
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:50,200
But death.

2540
03:00:52,460 --> 03:00:53,420
The wheel never works.

2541
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:54,480
The wheel is a trap.

2542
03:00:57,180 --> 03:01:00,460
Oh it's not even like a... You guys, it's a 25% chance.

2543
03:01:00,940 --> 03:01:01,780
With my luck?

2544
03:01:04,160 --> 03:01:06,200
Wait, but isn't the wheel like a meme?

2545
03:01:07,940 --> 03:01:09,720
I think I've heard of this one at least.

2546
03:01:15,260 --> 03:01:16,660
I want to do it for the meme.

2547
03:01:18,340 --> 03:01:19,940
If I get it...

2548
03:01:20,760 --> 03:01:21,840
You owe me 5 bucks.

2549
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:39,120
Don't believe them.

2550
03:01:39,180 --> 03:01:39,960
Do the wheel.

2551
03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:42,700
Rob, thank you for owning up.

2552
03:01:43,680 --> 03:01:45,180
Noah, thank you for owning up.

2553
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:46,900
WakeUpBlack, thank you for owning up.

2554
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:48,360
SeaMaru, thank you for owning up.

2555
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:49,880
EvanDix, thank you for owning up.

2556
03:01:52,940 --> 03:01:54,880
I should have made it higher.

2557
03:02:05,860 --> 03:02:07,260
Doubters and Shambles.

2558
03:02:12,200 --> 03:02:13,340
Thank you guys!

2559
03:02:13,340 --> 03:02:15,880
The wheel works every time baby!

2560
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:17,460
A deal is a deal.

2561
03:02:29,570 --> 03:02:31,110
Sorry, I still have a bit of a cough.

2562
03:02:31,190 --> 03:02:33,310
Hold on, let me take some throat stuff real quick.

2563
03:02:35,010 --> 03:02:37,730
I have some throat direct from Japan.

2564
03:02:42,490 --> 03:02:43,710
It's all green!

2565
03:02:44,670 --> 03:02:45,850
It's all mint though.

2566
03:02:48,110 --> 03:02:49,230
Thank you guys.

2567
03:02:52,490 --> 03:02:53,550
Thank you guys.

2568
03:02:59,010 --> 03:03:00,690
We love the wheel.

2569
03:03:02,970 --> 03:03:05,170
I think I'm gonna save my money.

2570
03:03:05,710 --> 03:03:10,690
I didn't believe and I accidentally made a timestamp for you hitting a nope even though it wasn't.

2571
03:03:12,310 --> 03:03:14,710
Thank you for the double contribution then.

2572
03:03:15,110 --> 03:03:16,690
Oh my gosh you guys, thank you!

2573
03:03:19,230 --> 03:03:20,110
Thank you, thank you.

2574
03:03:20,410 --> 03:03:20,910
Alrighty.

2575
03:03:22,930 --> 03:03:25,510
Let's do the next round!

2576
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:36,600
Plus three hand size.

2577
03:03:41,810 --> 03:03:42,970
We can do this.

2578
03:03:43,230 --> 03:03:45,230
One random joker disabled every hand.

2579
03:03:45,330 --> 03:03:46,150
Oh that's scary!

2580
03:03:46,790 --> 03:03:48,070
Wait, I don't know if we can do this.

2581
03:03:57,580 --> 03:03:59,020
What did this do?

2582
03:03:59,060 --> 03:04:00,360
What did the foil do anyway?

2583
03:04:02,260 --> 03:04:03,640
Did the foil even do anything?

2584
03:04:05,300 --> 03:04:07,440
Did it just make it shiny?

2585
03:04:09,160 --> 03:04:10,300
Oh, plus 50 chips.

2586
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:13,940
Wow, this hand sucks.

2587
03:04:14,640 --> 03:04:16,260
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2588
03:04:18,200 --> 03:04:19,220
Get out of here.

2589
03:04:20,580 --> 03:04:21,300
There we go.

2590
03:04:24,180 --> 03:04:26,020
1, 2... Oh my god!

2591
03:04:28,120 --> 03:04:30,200
I'm just gonna play this guy.

2592
03:04:36,170 --> 03:04:37,410
Feed the castle.

2593
03:04:38,070 --> 03:04:38,670
Diamond.

2594
03:04:47,530 --> 03:04:48,730
The flex.

2595
03:04:50,510 --> 03:04:52,170
2, 3, 4, wait.

2596
03:04:52,930 --> 03:04:55,030
Guys, I could even discard these.

2597
03:04:55,110 --> 03:04:56,270
That would be kind of crazy, right?

2598
03:04:57,270 --> 03:04:58,810
To feed the castle.

2599
03:04:59,110 --> 03:05:00,430
We'll still win.

2600
03:05:12,390 --> 03:05:15,990
1, 2, 3, 4.

2601
03:05:16,290 --> 03:05:17,290
Oh, the flush 5?

2602
03:05:17,290 --> 03:05:18,670
Okay, okay, okay.

2603
03:05:18,930 --> 03:05:20,510
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2604
03:05:23,150 --> 03:05:24,450
There you guys go.

2605
03:05:24,650 --> 03:05:26,190
There you guys go, the overkill.

2606
03:05:26,550 --> 03:05:28,050
The overkill, absolutely.

2607
03:05:28,490 --> 03:05:30,290
We only needed less than 500.

2608
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:46,080
Plus 80 chips if played hand contains 2 pair.

2609
03:05:47,220 --> 03:05:49,980
In sickness and in health?

2610
03:05:49,980 --> 03:05:50,360
lol

2611
03:05:53,400 --> 03:05:54,740
Streamer luck tax.

2612
03:05:54,780 --> 03:05:56,380
I don't know about that.

2613
03:05:57,400 --> 03:05:58,620
Thank you, Retro.

2614
03:06:00,980 --> 03:06:02,220
Choose one of the planets.

2615
03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:05,800
Choose the wheel.

2616
03:06:07,140 --> 03:06:08,160
Eric, thanks for the gift.

2617
03:06:10,160 --> 03:06:11,920
Keep 10 for boss re-roll.

2618
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:14,380
Oh, we could boss re-roll, right?

2619
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:15,240
Okay.

2620
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:20,980
I'm assuming that I re-roll when the boss comes up, right?

2621
03:06:27,980 --> 03:06:29,020
Super memetism.

2622
03:06:30,080 --> 03:06:31,480
Wait, I can re-roll now?

2623
03:06:37,080 --> 03:06:38,100
Don't, it's fine.

2624
03:06:38,300 --> 03:06:38,960
I don't know.

2625
03:06:39,800 --> 03:06:40,620
You think it's doable?

2626
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:45,020
There are scarier bosses, I believe.

2627
03:06:45,240 --> 03:06:46,760
But like, what if I lose?

2628
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:48,520
What if I lose one of my big multipliers?

2629
03:06:48,760 --> 03:06:50,560
I don't know, we might still be able to do it.

2630
03:06:51,560 --> 03:06:55,100
We might have like a big hand of...

2631
03:06:55,100 --> 03:06:56,940
The multiply ones with...

2632
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:58,380
When you have them in your hand, you know?

2633
03:06:59,780 --> 03:07:00,920
Only for one round.

2634
03:07:01,360 --> 03:07:01,620
Like

2635
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:08,080
this one.

2636
03:07:13,470 --> 03:07:15,710
My cough is starting to get bad, so...

2637
03:07:15,710 --> 03:07:18,270
Maybe once I beat the boss, I'll finish it off.

2638
03:07:18,550 --> 03:07:19,510
Was there a spade?

2639
03:07:20,150 --> 03:07:20,910
Oh, we don't have that.

2640
03:07:30,490 --> 03:07:31,010
Discard.

2641
03:07:33,110 --> 03:07:34,150
Nice suit.

2642
03:07:35,470 --> 03:07:37,010
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2643
03:07:38,150 --> 03:07:39,210
Wait, he hungers.

2644
03:07:42,810 --> 03:07:43,670
Box, thanks.

2645
03:07:44,470 --> 03:07:45,710
Thanks for joining membership.

2646
03:07:45,890 --> 03:07:46,390
Thank you.

2647
03:07:49,570 --> 03:07:51,030
Ok, last one.

2648
03:07:52,110 --> 03:07:52,730
Oh, ok.

2649
03:07:52,990 --> 03:07:54,990
1, 2, 3, 4...

2650
03:07:55,630 --> 03:07:57,190
I'm such an idiot, whatever.

2651
03:08:09,160 --> 03:08:10,260
There we go.

2652
03:08:12,360 --> 03:08:13,740
Steel has no bonus when played.

2653
03:08:13,960 --> 03:08:14,320
I know.

2654
03:08:17,530 --> 03:08:18,430
I know.

2655
03:08:24,050 --> 03:08:24,690
Oh!

2656
03:08:25,870 --> 03:08:27,850
Plus 20 multiplier of...

2657
03:08:27,850 --> 03:08:31,750
If played, hand contains 3 or fewer cards.

2658
03:08:33,070 --> 03:08:33,570
Green.

2659
03:08:34,830 --> 03:08:35,470
Green.

2660
03:08:37,050 --> 03:08:38,910
One free re-roll, poor shop.

2661
03:08:44,470 --> 03:08:45,790
To a standard pack.

2662
03:08:48,630 --> 03:08:50,010
Evan, it's ok.

2663
03:08:50,430 --> 03:08:51,230
Stand down.

2664
03:08:51,570 --> 03:08:52,470
Stand down, Evan.

2665
03:08:55,810 --> 03:08:56,530
Re-roll.

2666
03:09:00,440 --> 03:09:01,120
Saturn.

2667
03:09:01,560 --> 03:09:09,780
As the number of times poker hand has been played to this run...

2668
03:09:09,780 --> 03:09:10,820
Wait, poker hand?

2669
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:16,860
What's this poker hand?

2670
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:24,360
Oh wow, we're in here now.

2671
03:09:29,590 --> 03:09:30,550
Look at run info.

2672
03:09:32,690 --> 03:09:33,850
Oh, just this?

2673
03:09:34,590 --> 03:09:38,090
Wait, as the number of times poker hand has been played to...

2674
03:09:38,090 --> 03:09:41,210
Oh, so the poker hand changes.

2675
03:09:45,650 --> 03:09:46,210
Blink.

2676
03:09:46,250 --> 03:09:47,250
Thank you for the time gifter.

2677
03:09:47,550 --> 03:09:48,070
Thank you.

2678
03:09:51,130 --> 03:09:52,050
Ok guys.

2679
03:09:55,350 --> 03:09:57,450
I think we're gonna do the boss now.

2680
03:10:00,030 --> 03:10:01,990
Actually, let's open up a card pack.

2681
03:10:28,820 --> 03:10:31,660
I don't know, my cough has not been so bad.

2682
03:10:33,520 --> 03:10:34,620
So I apologize.

2683
03:10:34,620 --> 03:10:34,860
Guys.

2684
03:10:36,480 --> 03:10:38,220
Let's just go into it.

2685
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:45,220
One random joker is disabled.

2686
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:45,760
Castle!

2687
03:10:48,500 --> 03:10:51,360
That honestly is our best...

2688
03:10:51,360 --> 03:10:53,180
Is our...

2689
03:10:53,180 --> 03:10:54,980
Is the best one that could be disabled.

2690
03:10:55,440 --> 03:10:56,560
Yeah, let's go castle!

2691
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:02,360
He has a tummy ache.

2692
03:11:03,780 --> 03:11:04,340
Oh.

2693
03:11:05,580 --> 03:11:06,140
But,

2694
03:11:09,860 --> 03:11:11,600
it's gonna change into something else.

2695
03:11:11,940 --> 03:11:14,120
But this will give us a big advantage until then.

2696
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:17,700
Oh, not as big as I imagined.

2697
03:11:17,960 --> 03:11:18,680
Oh, wait!

2698
03:11:19,160 --> 03:11:20,000
Oh my god.

2699
03:11:24,060 --> 03:11:24,860
Let's go!

2700
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:29,140
Let's go.

2701
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:50,280
I guess we'll just do one, two, three.

2702
03:11:51,840 --> 03:11:52,840
Which is better?

2703
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:55,120
Five of a kind?

2704
03:11:55,780 --> 03:11:55,920
What?

2705
03:11:57,600 --> 03:11:58,620
Five of a kind?

2706
03:11:59,180 --> 03:12:00,140
Or four of a kind?

2707
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:02,740
Oh wait, five of a kind is technique...

2708
03:12:02,740 --> 03:12:05,600
Wait, what's the times 18 times 19?

2709
03:12:21,160 --> 03:12:22,340
The base multiplier.

2710
03:12:22,460 --> 03:12:23,540
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

2711
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:27,560
So five...

2712
03:12:28,360 --> 03:12:29,240
My math.

2713
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:31,220
I can't do that math.

2714
03:12:35,890 --> 03:12:37,730
Five is slightly better now.

2715
03:12:37,970 --> 03:12:39,750
Five is slightly better.

2716
03:12:43,490 --> 03:12:45,170
I think we might be able to win.

2717
03:13:06,320 --> 03:13:07,280
We won!

2718
03:13:24,890 --> 03:13:26,650
My cough is not very good.

2719
03:13:26,730 --> 03:13:28,450
I'm gonna go take some medicine you guys.

2720
03:13:28,530 --> 03:13:28,890
Sorry.

2721
03:13:28,890 --> 03:13:28,950
Sorry.

2722
03:13:30,690 --> 03:13:32,650
I don't have any water.

2723
03:13:34,130 --> 03:13:35,150
But we won!

2724
03:13:35,670 --> 03:13:36,570
First try baby!

2725
03:13:39,510 --> 03:13:41,750
I can't talk so much though.

2726
03:13:42,930 --> 03:13:43,490
Seed.

2727
03:13:43,490 --> 03:13:44,050
Tutorial.

2728
03:13:46,750 --> 03:13:47,310
Okay,

2729
03:14:12,500 --> 03:14:13,740
I really gotta go guys.

2730
03:14:13,780 --> 03:14:14,500
I'm so sorry.

2731
03:14:15,840 --> 03:14:17,840
I'm so sorry but...

2732
03:14:17,840 --> 03:14:18,880
I wanted to talk some more.

2733
03:14:20,400 --> 03:14:21,240
But I gotta go.

2734
03:14:21,240 --> 03:14:22,100
Okay.

2735
03:14:24,460 --> 03:14:26,500
Tutorial was fun.

2736
03:14:27,580 --> 03:14:28,840
I actually like Bellatio.

2737
03:14:31,680 --> 03:14:34,000
I'll see you guys later.

2738
03:14:34,940 --> 03:14:36,480
Otsumito, bye bye!

2739
03:14:37,260 --> 03:14:37,920
Bye bye.
